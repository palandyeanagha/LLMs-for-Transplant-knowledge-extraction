ABSTRACT: Sagittal otoliths of young-of-year American shad Alosa sapidjssirna from the Hudson River 
estuary, New York, USA, were transected with an X-ray-dispersive microprobe to examine temporal 
patterns of strontium, a micro-constituent found in otolith aragonite. Otoliths were assayed from fish 
reared on known diets (freshwater zooplankton, followed by artificial diet containing marine fishmeal) 
in fresh water. The switch from freshwater plankton to artificial diet resulted in a significant rise in Sr:Ca 
ratio in the otolith (mean increase 3.2-fold, p < 0.001) both for fish reared at 12S°C and those reared at 
22"C, although there was no significant difference in Sr:Ca increases between the 2 temperature treat￾ments. In a field study, Sr:Ca values of otoliths from wild fish caught in the freshwater reaches of the 
Hudson were low (mean 0.79 X 10-~ Sr:Ca * 0.32 SD, range 0.00 to 1.46 X 10-~). Six fish captured in a single 
t.raw1 in the lower estuary on 25 September 1990 had low Sr:Ca values on the inner parts of their otoliths 
(corresponding to younger age: mean Sr.Ca = 0.98 X 10'~ * 0.38 SU), but the strontium content increased 
3- to 5-fold (mean Sr:Ca = 3.62 X 10-3 2 0.71 SD) on the outer parts, corresponding to dates when the fish 
were older. The change in strontium content is consistent with the movement of fish from freshwater to 
seawater, as seawater has a higher Sr concentration and ratio of Sr:Ca. The same change was seen in the 
otolith of a female adult shad and has been documented in other diadromous fishes. Three of these juve￾niles had such anomalous early growth patterns as to suggest their origin in a natal river other than the 
Hudson. The estimated seawater entry dates of these fish were as early as late June. This is the first 
demonstration of such early outmigration, and possibly vagrancy, in young-of-year of this species, and 
contributes to our understanding of American shad life history.

INTRODUCTION 
Otoliths (earstones) of teleost fishes form a critical 
part of the acoustico-lateralis system (Moyle & Cech 
1988). In most species, otoliths are composed of arago￾nite precipitated on a protein matrix (Degens et al. 
1969) and appear to accrete new material throughout 
the life of the fish. Whereas coarse otolith macro￾structures (annuli) have long been used to determine 
the age of fish 21 yr (e.g. Reibisch 1900, Dannevig 
1933), much work in the past 20 yr has focused 
on microstructure (e.g. Campana & Neilson 1985, 
Brothers 1987). Micro-increments have been shown to 
accrete daily (Pannella 1971, Brothers et al. 1976), 
stimulating studies of age estimation in teleosts 
(Summerfelt & Hall 1987, Secor et al. 1994). 
Chemical composition of otoliths has likewise inter￾ested investigators for some time (Dannevig 1956, 
Odum 195713, Degens et al. 1969). Recent advances in 
X-ray spectroscopy have allowed fine-scale examina￾tion of trace inorganic constituents of otoliths (e.g. 
Radtke 1984, Gauldie et al. 1986, Kalish 1989, Gunn et 
al. 1992, Secor 1992). Strontium has been of particular 
interest because of its potential to reveal information 
about environments in which fish live. Strontium (Sr), 
like calcium (Ca) an alkaline earth element, has a 
similar crystal ionic radius (Ca = 0.99 A, Sr = 1.13 A; 
Atkins 1978), and can substitute into the aragonite 
crystal lattice as a trace constituent (Degens et al. 
1969). 
The incorporation of Sr vs Ca in inorganic arago￾nitic precipitations has been found to be inversely 
correlated with the temperature at which it was de￾posited (Kinsman & Holland 1969), and Radtke (1984, 
1989) demonstrated a similar relationship in fish 
otoliths. However, even larger differences in Sr:Ca

exist when comparing freshwater to marine environ￾ments due to the relative scarcity of Sr in fresh water. 
Seawater strontium concentration is reported as rela￾tively constant (ca 90 yM) throughout the world's 
oceans (Table 1). Freshwater strontium can vary con￾siderably due to geology and weathering conditions 
(Odum 1957b, Durum & Haffty 1963, Skougstad & 
Horr 1963). In the contiguous United States, Sr:Ca 
levels are generally low in cooler, moister areas and 
higher in warm, arid ones (Table 1). Distributions of 
Sr:Ca in U.S. surface waters are typically lognormal: 
most surface water Sr:Ca ratios are less than 3.5 X 
10-3 (Odum 1957a. Durum & Haffty 1963, Skougstad 
& Horr 1963). 
Differences appear in relative Sr concentrations in 
otoliths from fish caught in different salinities, as well. 
For instance, Odum (1957b) noted nearly 5-fold 
greater Sr:Ca in marine (Long Island Sound and the 
Atlantic Ocean at North Carolina, USA) versus fresh￾water (Mill Pond, Connecticut) otoliths. More re￾cently, microprobe analysis has shown that otoliths of 
diadromous fishes exhibit large Sr:Ca fluctuations as 
the freshwater-marine gradient is traversed (migrat￾ing eels in the St. Lawrence: Casselman 1982; Der￾went (Tasmania) River anadromous salmonids: Kalish 
1990; Chesapeake Bay (USA) striped bass: Secor 
1992). Coutant & Chen (1993), studying strontium 
levels along transects of striped bass scales from the 
Roanoke River-Albemarle Sound (North Carolina) 
system, found patterns consistent with fish being 
spawned in higher salinity waters and then moving to 
fresh water. 
I report here on 2 applications of the microprobe 
technique to examine the Sr:Ca ratios measured along 
transects on otoliths from juvenile American shad 
Alosa sapidissima, an anadromous herring common 
along the coastal western Atlantic. In the first appli￾cation, otoliths were examined from fish that had 
been part of a growth experiment. These fish were 
reared entirely in fresh water from a single source, but 
their diet was switched 42 d post hatch from naturally 
occurring zooplankton to an artificial feed containing 
marine fishmeal, which had elevated strontium rela￾tive to the freshwater zooplankton. A set of observa￾tions on otoliths from 10 fish from this growth experi￾ment, which lasted 12 wk, tests the hypothesis that diet 
alone can influence the incorporation of Sr into 
otoliths. 
In a demographic study of the 1990 year-class from 
the Hudson River, New York, USA (Lirnburg 1994), 
several juveniles (7 out of 1504 examined) had total 
lengths 2130 mm (Fig. 1). In addition, growth rate 
anomalies were observed in 3 other fish with back￾calculated hatch dates in early May. The anomalous 
fish had otolith growth rate patterns that placed them 
in the 99 percentile for high growth in May. 
Based on length at age or growth rate, these fish, all 
collected in the lower estuary between river kilometers 
(Km) 39 and 69, represented outliers in the population. 
In the second application, microprobe analysis was 
used to test the hypothesis that these individuals were 
not from the Hudson-spawned population, but rather 
were vagrants (sensu Sinclair 1988) from a different 
river system.

MATERIALS AND METHODS 
Study sites. The Hudson River is located in eastern 
New York State and drains some 34 680 km2. It flows in 
a southerly direction for 507 km, draining into the New 
York Bight at New York Bay (Limburg et al. 1986). A 
dam located at Km 245 (Green Island) separates the 
upper, nontidal river from the lower, tidal portion. The 
lower Hudson, a partially stratified estuary (Abood 
1974), receives salt water through the Verrazano 
Narrows in New York Bay. The extent of seawater 
intrusion varies with seasonal freshwater river flows 
(Abood 1974, Simpson et al. 1974). During surnrner￾time low freshwater flows, the salt front (0.5%) is usu￾ally located ca 80 to 100 km up the estuary (Abood 
1974). Vertical salinity stratification is usually weak at 
this time due to mixing (McCrone 1966, Busby & 
Darmer 1970, Abood 1974, Simpson et al. 1974) but 
surface-to-bottom gradients of 10%o at Piermont (river 
Km 40) can occur (Simpson et al. 1974). 
American shad use the tidal part of the river exclu￾sively. Adult shad enter the Hudson in late March or 
early April, and spawn in fresh water from Km 145 to 
245 (peak Km 182) for a prolonged period when tem￾peratures occur between 14 and 20°C (Talbot 1954, 
Schmidt et al. 1988). Juveniles are found throughout 
the tidal riverine-estuarine system from July through 
November, but exit before the onset of winter. 
Laboratory study. Laboratory studies were con￾ducted at the National Fishery Research and Develop￾ment Laboratory (NFRDL), United States Fish and 
Wildlife Service, located in Wellsboro, Pennsylvania. 
Experimental fish, of Hudson River origin, were reared 
from fertilized eggs (8 male and 15 female parents). 
18 d old larvae were obtained from the Van Dyke 
Hatchery, Thompsontown, Pennsylvania, in June 1989 
and transferred into an artificial rearing pond at 
NFRDL, and reared to approximately 50 mm total 
length (TL). After 24 d in the pond, the fish were given 
an open-formula feed, ASD-20 (Lemm et al. 1988). 
Two days later, approximately 1200 fish were collected 
from the pond and transported to the laboratory, using 
modifications of techniques described in Backman & 
Ross (1991). In the laboratory, fish were held in 500 1 
tanks for a 12 wk growth experiment. The water 
source for the pond and the lab were identical; both 
pond and tanks were fed continuously by fresh inflow. 
Fish were fed at 3 different ration levels on ASD-20 
and held at 3 different temperatures. Full details of the 
growth experiment are described in Limburg (1994). 
For the present study, otoliths were selected from 5 fish 
reared in a 22OC, satiation ration treatment, and from 
5 fish from a 12.5OC, satiation ration treatment, in 
order to test for temperature-mediated differences in 
Sr uptake. 
Wild fish collections. Wild fish were collected during 
the summer and fall of 1990 at 1 upriver, 1 mid-river, 
and 2 downriver sites (Fig. 2, Table 2). Collections 
were made either with a 30.5 m bag seine (0.64 cm bar 
mesh), or with a 7.9 m headrope Carolina wing bottom 
trawl (3.8, 3.2, and 1.3 cm in the trawl body, cod end, 
and cod liner, respectively). 
Fish for microchemical otolith analysis were selected 
at random from 4 upriver (Albany: Km 240) and 4 mid￾river (Poughkeepsie: Km 120) individuals to provide 
data on the freshwater Sr:Ca baseline. Seven randomly 
selected fish were examined from the downriver beach 
seine site (Tappan Zee: Km 39 to 50). These fish had 
otolith microstructures which were typical for most 
juveniles collected throughout the Hudson River in 
1990. Three fish with otolith microstructures that 
showed atypically high growth rates in May and 3 
other fish (all 6 collected by bottom trawl in Haver￾Table 2. Description of sampling sites and gear used in 1990

Otoliths were also assayed from 5 young-of-year shad 
of unusually large size (> 130 mm TL), collected in the 
lower estuary in early November Finally, the sagittal 
otolith from a single adult female, caught at Kingston, 
New York (Km 145) during the 1991 spawning run, 
was probed. 
Otolith preparation. Sagittal otoliths were extracted, 
cleaned with 10 % sodium hypochlorite (bleach), air￾dried, and subsequently embedded in Spurr epoxy. 
The cured plastic stubs containing the otoliths were 
ground to roughly 0.5 mm thickness. Otoliths were 
then ground to approximately the mid-sagittal plane to 
expose the core, and polished with the following series 
of 3M lapping papers: 30, 15, 9, 5, and 3 pm. American 
shad otoliths are relatively flat, so grinding to expose 
the core did not result in loss of outer-most increments. 
After examination of microstructures, the otoliths were 
re-polished, this time down to 0.5 pm. The otolith 
surface was cleaned with 95% ethanol between 
polishings. Final cleaning was with ultrasonication, 
using isopropanol as the cleaning agent. Otolith stubs 
were then mounted on slides and coated with carbon 
(- 250 A thickness) by high-vacuum evaporation. 
Otolith microstructure. Otoliths were examined 
with a Leitz Orthoplan compound microscope with 
video attachment. Daily increments have been vali￾dated for larval and juvenile American shad (Savoy & 
Crecco 1987, Limburg 1994). Increments were counted 
(2 to 3x) on the major posterior axis. Increment widths 
were measured by placing cash register tape on the 
video screen and marking increments on the tape. 
Distortion due to curvature of the screen was slight 
(< 5%). Increment marks were then digitized with a 
Graf/Bar GP-7 sonic digitizer (Science Accessories 
Corporation) and normalized to the length of the major 
posterior axis. Precision on counts was & 3 d and 
accuracy on known-age juveniles was within 5% 
(Limburg 1994). 
Microprobe analysis. Sr and Ca concentrations were 
quantified with a JEOL 733 wavelength dispersive 
electron microprobe at the Materials Science Center 
EM Facility, Cornell University, New York. Following 
recommendations by Gunn et al. (1992), long counting 
times along with a wide beam diameter of 20 pm 
were used to collect Sr counts; this reduces specimen 
damage and improves the quality of the data. Acceler￾ating voltage was set at 20 kV and probe current at 
20 nA. Sr was counted for 60 S and Ca for 20 S. Back￾ground was measured for 30 s on each side of the Sr 
peak and subtracted. Calcite was used for the calcium 
standard. The Sr standard was Corning Glass 'X' (dis￾tributed by the Microbeam Analysis Society), which 
has a low concentration of SrO (0.79 % by weight) and 
is thus suitable for trace element analysis. Weight 
percents of SrO and CaO were computed from X-ray 
counts with the Bence-Albee correction factors (Albee 
& Ray 1970), and converted to atom percents of Sr and 
Ca, respectively. Precision of Ca and Sr (as measured 
on the standards) was 0.2 and 1.4%, respectively 
(Goldstein et al. 1981). The minimum detectable level 
of Sr was 290 ppm. Results are given as atoms Sr per 
1000 atoms Ca. 
Transects were made along the longest posterior axis 
of the otolith, as had been done for measuring growth. 
Between 9 and 20 equally spaced points were assayed, 
with interpoint distances ranging from 25 to 99 pm 
apart, depending on the size of the otolith and the 
number of data points read. After microprobe meas￾urements, the distance of the first point (visib1.e as a

Analysis of artificial diet. A sample of the diet fed 
to fish at NFRDL was archived and analyzed for Sr g: o 
Fish reared for laboratory experiments showed 
marked changes in Sr:Ca that corresponded to 
changes in diet, as seen in 2 typical Sr:Ca transects 
(Fig. 3). For all but 3 of the fish, initial values were very 
low (Table 3). Otoliths that were sampled directly 
on the primordium had low values, in contrast with 
anadromous salmonids (Kalish 1990). Otoliths of the 
remaining 3 fish had moderately high initial Sr:Ca 
values, followed by low values, then followed by high 
values again as the fish were brought into the labora￾tory, In many cases, the otolith was sampled during the 
pond period just when fish had been introduced to the 
artificial diet; this was reflected as an increase in 
Sr:Ca. Once in the laboratory, fed entirely on artificial 
diet, Sr:Ca values quickly reached a maximum val.ue 
and then declined somewhat (Fig. 3). This may have 
been due to a slow-down in growth rate over time.

Repeated measures analyses of variance (ANOVA) 
revealed that diet was the main source of variation

effects on otolith Sr:Ca, due to within-subject vari￾ability and small sample size (necessitated by cost 
constraints).

Otoliths from fish collected in near-shore habitats in 
the oligo- to mesohaline stretch of the estuary (Tappan 
Zee) showed more variability. One fish in particular, 
caught 14 August (Fig. 4c), had 3-fold variation in 
Sr:Ca. The pattern of Sr:Ca along that transect 
suggests an early experience with elevated Sr, then a 
decline, and finally a marked increase. Another fish, 
caught 18 October, had elevated Sr:Ca in the middle 
and the end of the transect. These excursions were 
higher than any values recorded in the freshwater 
reaches, and when the otoliths were re-assayed in the 
same regions, were repeatable.

tember show a pattern of initially low Sr:Ca, 
followed by rapid increases, indicative of movement 
into a marine environment (Radtke et al. 1988). Mean 
increases (averaging the presumed 'freshwater' and 
'marine' data) ranged from 250 to 620% in the 6 fish, 
and are in good agreement with the Sr:Ca record 
from the otolith of an adult shad (Fig. 6) and 
with adult anadromous striped bass (Secor 1992). In 
contrast, anomalously large specimens collected on 
8 November (Figs. 4e & Fig. 5) show low Sr:Ca values 
consistent with data presented for freshwater resident 
fish. 
Daily otolith increment widths and superimposed 
Sr:Ca transects for 1 of the Haverstraw Bay fish col￾lected on 25 September (Fig. ?a), and for a fish col￾lected in the same region in early November 
(Fig. 7b) show different patterns. The otolith growth 
tracks differ markedly in the timing of peak growth: 
the September-caught fish shows a peak in early 
June (Days 150 to 160), whereas the maxima in the 
November-caught fish center on Days 190 to 200 
(mid-July). Growth rates in the first 30 d differ 
dramatically, despite proxin~ity in back-calculated 
hatch dates: the November fish shows growth that 
agrees with the growth of larvae collected in late 
May and June 1990 (LMS 1992, Limburg 1994), and 
with water temperature data (LMS 1992). When com￾pared statistically with the distribution of average 
May growth rates of fish hatched before 16 May, the 
probability that the fish shown in Fig. ?a belonged to 
the Hudson population is very low (z = 4.280; p < 
10-4). 
The increase in Sr:Ca (Fig. ?a) appears to coincide 
with a decline in otolith growth rate. This may be 
fortuitous, as growth rate increases and declines are 
typical also of fish in freshwater habitats (Fig. 7b), 
without corresponding changes in Sr:Ca. Estimated 
'sea entry dates' (dates when Sr:Ca rises on the otolith 
transect) for all fishes collected 25 September occur in 
June through mid August (Table 5).

DISCUSSION 
Sr uptake from food 
Fish reared in fresh water had significantly higher 
otolith Sr:Ca ratios when switched from a diet of fresh￾water zooplankton to artificial food containing at least 
50% marine herring and shrimp. The magnitude of 
Sr:Ca increase (average 3.3 times) was not quite as 
large as that reported by Mugiya et al. (1991). In that 
study, goldfish were exposed to 10 mg 1-' Sr in solu￾tion, and showed a >5-fold increase in otolith Sr:Ca 
over controls. 
In the present study, within-subject variability was 
great enough to swamp the possible effects of temper￾ature on Sr uptake by fish in the lab. However, fish 
reared at 22°C consistently had higher Sr:Ca values 
than fish reared at 12S°C (Table 3), and a temperature 
effect might have been detectable with a larger sample 
size. Hoff & Fuiman (1993) found an increase in both Sr 
and Ca in red drum Sciaenops ocellatus otoliths with 
increasing temperature and age. In the fish I exam￾ined, the relationship appears more closely coupled 
with growth rate, since highest rates of Sr incorpora￾tion occurred shortly after the fish were moved into the 
laboratory when the otoliths were still growing rapidly, 
and declined as otolith growth rates decelerated, even 
as the temperature remained constant. On the other 
hand, the observed peaks in otolith Sr:Ca may also be 
associated with the stress of being moved from the 
pond into the laboratory; further work would be 
required to separate the effects of diet and stress. 
Sr:Ca in wild fish otoliths 
Otolith strontium concentration is affected by 
salinity more than it is affected by temperature (Secor 
et al. 1995). Although the degree to which otolith Sr 
varies along a seawater gradient has not been verified 
for American shad, the results in this study are consis￾tent with previous findings (Casselman 1982, Radtke et 
al. 1988, Kalish 1989, 1990, Secor 1992). 
Because a large part of the Hudson valley is com￾posed of marine carbonates, it is of interest to know 
the Sr:Ca ratios of Hudson valley bedrock, and how 
bedrock influences strontium and calcium in river 
water. The lower Hudson drainage runs through lirne￾stone (Km 160 to 250), shales and slates (Km 100 to 
160), and further south a mix of igneous, metamorphic, 
and sandstone rock (Johnsen 1966). Limestones have 
relatively low Sr:Ca ratios (average 0.81 0.83 SD X 
10-3; Kulp et al. 1952). Odum (1957b) suggested that 
these low ratios were due not only to the predomi￾nance of calcite, the crystal lattice of which does not 
incorporate Sr as readily as aragonite, but also because 
processes that cause calcite deposition may in turn 
release strontium into solution. Shales collected in the 
Hudson valley and adjoining Catskills were enriched 
in Sr compared to carbonates (range 1.55 to 12.62 X 
10-3 Sr:Ca; Turekian & Kulp 1956). Adirondack rock 
(mainly Canadian Shield anorthosite), which underlies 
the uppermost Hudson drainage, is strontium enriched 
(average of 4 samples, 49.98 X 10-3 Sr:Ca, 10.09 X 
SD; Turekian & Kulp 1956). 
Relatively few data exist on Sr:Ca ratios in Hudson 
River waters. Fabricand et al. (1968) measured stron￾tium, calcium, and salinity longitudinally on the 
Hudson from Km 56 to 240 in July 1965. A minimum of 
1.62 X 10-3 Sr:Ca was found at Km 180 (North German￾town) and increased to 3.08 X 10-3 at Km 240. The 
highest ratio (7.32 X IO-~) was found in bottom waters 
at Km 56 (Tappan Zee). In 1990, Sr:Ca values in the 
Hudson River measured at Green Island (Km 245) 
averaged 2.45 * 0.14 X 10-3 (N = 4; Firda et al. 1991) in 
good agreement with Mohawk River data (2.66 X 10-3) 
presented by Skougstad & Horr (1963). The Sr:Ca 
minimum in Hudson River water between Pough￾keepsie and Germantown (Km 120 to 180) may reflect 
passage through low Sr:Ca drainages. Otoliths of shad 
collected in Poughkeepsie had slightly lower Sr:Ca 
ratios compared to Albany shad (Fig. 5). 
Otolith Sr:Ca was generally low (< 2 X 10-3' in wild 
Hudson River fish, with the notable exception of 6 fish 
collected by bottom trawl in the lower estuary. Since 
these fish all came from the same net haul, it is possible 
they were part of a school that had wandered in to the 
Hudson from saline waters surrounding New York Bay, 
i.e. the New York Bight or Long Island Sound. Odum 
(1957a) reported Sr:Ca values for Long Island Sound 
averaging 9.39 X 10-3 (* 1.10 X 10-3 SD) and 1 datum 
from the Hudson River at Poughkeepsie, New York of 
2.65 X 10-3. The 3.5-fold difference in seawater versus 
freshwater Hudson Sr:Ca is consistent with differences 
observed in the migrating fish. 
Alternatively, these fish may have moved into higher 
salinity bottom waters near the estuary mouth. Mean 
bottom salinities in the lower estuary (Yonkers vicinity, 
Km 19 to 32) ranged from 3.3 to 11.4%0 during June￾October (LMS 1992). A single datum exists from Fabri￾cand et al. (1968) of 7.32 X IO-~ Sr:Ca at 10.2%0 salinity. 
This value is 4.5 times higher than the minimum re￾ported in the same study. Such a difference is also con￾sistent with differences seen in the shad otoliths, albeit 
from a single data point. Further collection of strontium 
data in the lower Hudson, in combination with con￾trolled rearing of shad in different salinities, would 
help to clarify whether shad could pick up sufficient 
strontium in the lower estuary to show patterns as in 
Fig. 4d. 

Limburg: Environmental h istory of Amencan shad 3 3 
When the Sr:Ca data are aligned with otolith growth 
data to obtain estimates of calendar dates correspond￾ing to the Sr:Ca samples, Sr:Ca levels rise in late June 
through mid August (Table 5), indicating early experi￾ence with elevated salinity. It is likely that at least 3 
of the fish were of Hudson River origin, based upon 
otolith microstructure. The 3 remaining fish showed 
4- to 5-fold higher growth rates in late May and early 
June than would be expected from otoliths of larvae 
collected during that period (Limburg 1994). Growth 
rates of larvae, which were collected throughout the 
tidal Hudson River, corresponded well with tempera￾ture records in May and June (LMS 1992). The entire 
Hudson was cool during May (14.3"C, Km 0 and 120), 
due in part to heavy rainfalls (Limburg 1994) and larval 
lengths remained around 10 to 12 mm (LMS 1992) 
with correspondingly low otolith increment widths 
(Limburg 1994). The larval and thermal data are at 
odds with the otolith growth tracks of the remaining 
3 fish collected on 25 September. While it is possible 
these fish had discovered a completely different (most 
likely warmer) environment within the Hudson, it is 
also possible that they were hatched in another river 
system with a different thermal regime during May. 
The evidence from fish size distributions, otolith 
growth rates, and hydrographic data (Limburg 1994) 
points to the second possibility. 
None of the other trawl-collected fish (8 November) 
showed elevated Sr:Ca ratios, nor were their otolith 
growth patterns atypical when compared to other 
fishes from the study. However, their large sizes were 
anomalous: whereas most fish were < 100 mm TL and 
weighed <6 g, these fish were >l30 mm TL (up to 
155 mm) and weighed in excess of 12 g (up to 26 g). 
Such large fish may have been using a different 
habitat than fish in the near-shore areas; however, in 
general juvenile shad appear to use near-shore areas 
dunng the daytime and move off-shore at night 
(Limburg pers. obs.). 
In addition, 2 or 3 otolith trajectories from fish caught 
by beach seine in near-shore habitats in the lower 
Hudson estuary showed moderate to marked increases 
in Sr:Ca at various points. These variations may have 
arisen when saline water masses moved into the 
estuary as summertime freshwater flows declined; 
however, one might expect to see similar variations on 
all the otoliths from fish caught in that area, if they 
were present there during these proposed seawater 
intrusions. Alternatively, individual fish may have 
made excursions into waters of increased salinity, and 
then moved to lower salinity areas. Such movements 
might be either longitudinal (downriver to saltier 
waters, then retreat upriver) or horizontal (movement 
into deeper, more saline channels and then back into 
fresher shallows). 
These results have important implications for our 
understanding of American shad life history. The Sr:Ca 
data provide evidence of departure (Table 5) from the 
natal freshwater environment much earlier than has 
been previously reported (Walburg & Nichols 1969, 
Leggett & Whitney 1972, Leggett 1976, O'Leary & 
Kynard 1986), and at a much younger age (ca 6 to 9 wk 
old). Assuming the patterns of elevated Sr:Ca do 
reflect seawater entry, then these are the first data to 
confirm early (pre-autumn) out-migration of juvenile 
American shad from natal rivers, a phenomenon that 
has been hypothesized by Chittenden (1969) and 
Marcy (1976). Further, juvenile American shad may 
make brief forays back and forth between estuary and 
sea, or wander back into estuaries during the first year, 
phenomena which have not been reported at all. 
To confirm adequately that the 3 'suspected vagrants' 
originated in another river system, temperature re￾cords from other spawning rivers would be needed, in 
addition to stock identification data, e.g. mitochondrial 
DNA or meristic information. If these are truly 'vagrants' 
from another population (Sinclair 1988), interesting 
questions could be posed. For instance, would these 
fish have eventually returned to their natal river to 
spawn, or alternatively would they have not shown 
natal river fidelity? Lack of fidelity to a natal river can 
have important consequences for the evolution of 
population structure. 
The immediate fate of out-migrating young-of-year 
shad is largely unknown, although there is evidence 
that juveniles shoal just off the coast during the first 
winter (Milstein 1981). The relative success of early 
versus late out-migrants in terms of their contribu￾tion to spawning populations is also unknown. With 
the microprobe technique, it should be possible to 
examine the first year's growth in otoliths of returning 
adult shad, and to estimate fairly accurately the time of 
their departure from a natal freshwater environment. 
This information would shed light on successful migra￾tion strategies.
