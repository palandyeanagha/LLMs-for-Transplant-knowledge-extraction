Abstract
Introduction The effectiveness of non-invasive positive pressure
ventilation (NIV) in COPD patients with prolonged hypercapnia
after ventilatory support for acute respiratory failure (ARF) remains
unclear. We investigated if nocturnal NIV in these patients prolongs
the time to readmission for respiratory causes or death (primary
endpoint) in the following 12 months.
Methods 201 COPD patients admitted to hospital with ARF and
prolonged hypercapnia >48 h after termination of ventilatory


support were randomised to NIV or standard treatment. Secondary
outcomes were daytime arterial blood gasses, transcutaneous PCO2
during the night, lung function, health-related quality-of-life
(HRQL), mood state, daily activities and dyspnoea.
Results 1 year after discharge, 65% versus 64% of patients (NIV vs
standard treatment) were readmitted to hospital for respiratory
causes or had died; time to event was not different (p=0.85).
Daytime PaCO2 was significantly improved in NIV versus standard
treatment (PaCO2 0.5 kPa (95% CI 0.04 to 0.90, p=0.03)) as was
transcutaneous PCO2 during the night. HRQL showed a trend
(p=0.054, Severe Respiratory Insufficiency questionnaire) in favour
of NIV. Number of exacerbations, lung function, mood state, daily
activity levels or dyspnoea was not significantly different.
Discussions We could not demonstrate an improvement in time to
readmission or death by adding NIV for 1 year in patients with
prolonged hypercapnia after an episode of NIV for ARF. There is no
reason to believe the NIV was not effective since daytime PaCO2
and night-time PCO2 improved. The trend for improvement in
HRQL favouring NIV we believe nevertheless should be explored
further.
Trial registration number NTR1100.
