Abstract
Objectives: Currently, no standardized method is available to predict success rate after percutaneous nephrolithotomy. We
devised and validated the Seoul National University Renal Stone Complexity (S-ReSC) scoring system for predicting the
stone-free rate after single-tract percutaneous nephrolithotomy (sPCNL).
Patients and Methods: The data of 155 consecutive patients who underwent sPCNL were retrospectively analyzed.
Preoperative computed tomography images were reviewed. The S-ReSC score was assigned from 1 to 9 based on the
number of sites involved in the renal pelvis (#1), superior and inferior major calyceal groups (#2–3), and anterior and
posterior minor calyceal groups of the superior (#4–5), middle (#6–7), and inferior calyx (#8–9). The inter- and intra￾observer agreements were accessed using the weighted kappa (k). The stone-free rate and complication rate were
evaluated according to the S-ReSC score. The predictive accuracy of the S-ReSC score was assessed using the area under the
receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).
Results: The overall SFR was 72.3%. The mean S-ReSC score was 3.1562.1. The weighted kappas for the inter- and intra￾observer agreements were 0.832 and 0.982, respectively. The SFRs in low (1 and 2), medium (3 and 4), and high (5 or higher)
S-ReSC scores were 96.0%, 69.0%, and 28.9%, respectively (p,0.001). The predictive accuracy was very high (AUC 0.860).
After adjusting for other variables, the S-ReSC score was still a significant predictor of the SFR by multiple logistic regression.
The complication rates were increased to low (18.7%), medium (28.6%), and high (34.2%) (p = 0.166).
Conclusions: The S-ReSC scoring system is easy to use and reproducible. This score accurately predicts the stone-free rate
after sPCNL. Furthermore, this score represents the complexity of surgery.

Introduction
The incidence of urolithiasis is approximately 5% to 10% in the
general population, and 30% of the surgical workload is related to
urinary stone treatment in an active urologic department [1,2].
Large renal stones can cause pain, hematuria, infection, renal
function deterioration, and mortality [3]. Thus, large renal stones
should be actively treated, except in patients who are otherwise too
ill to tolerate stone removal. Among several treatment options,
percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) is a standard treatment for
patients with large renal stones [3,4], because it has been
demonstrated to have the highest stone-free rate (SFR) [3].
However, it does not result in a 100% SFR. Furthermore, many
patients experience significant complications despite its minimally
invasive nature. Overall, the recently published Clinical Research
Office of the Endourological Society (CROES) PCNL global study
reported an SFR of 75.5% and a complication rate of 20.5% [5].
The clinical results vary widely case by case because of the varying
characteristics of renal stones. A higher stone burden and
complexity is associated with a lower SFR and a higher
complication rate [3,6]. There have been some proposed models
to predict the results for renal stones [7,8], however, none of them
are accepted as the standardized method to predict the SFR after
PCNL, yet. Thus, many urologists find it difficult to predict precise
outcomes and tailor informed decision making with patients.
Our experience performing PCNL led to the hypothesis that the
distributional complexity of stones is more associated with the SFR
than the number or size of stones. Thus, we devised the Seoul
National University Renal Stone Complexity (S-ReSC) scoring
system to predict the SFR after PCNL. This scoring system is
simply calculated by counting the number of sites involved among
9 pre-determined locations in the pelvicalyceal system. We
evaluated the ability of the S-ReSC scoring system to predict the

SFR and represent the surgical difficulty of single-tract PCNL
(sPCNL).
Materials and Methods
Ethics Statement
This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board
(IRB) of Seoul National University Bundang Hospital (Seongnam,
Republic of Korea). The approval number is B-1211/178-109.
We were given exemption from getting informed consents by the
IRB. It was a retrospective study. And personal identifiers were all
removed and the data were anonymously analyzed.
Patients and Procedures
A total of 155 consecutive sPCNL cases were included from
January 2004 through July 2012 at Seoul National University
Bundang Hospital. Percutaneous renal access was routinely
obtained by 2 experienced uro-radiologists 1 day before or on
the operative day. If the patient previously had a percutaneous

nephrostomy, this nephrostomy was used as an access. sPCNL was
performed in a prone position by 1 of 4 faculty professors. A rigid
nephroscope was used in combination with a ballistic lithotripter,
stone forceps, and a suction tube. If needed, a flexible nephroscope
and/or ureteroscope were also used for collecting systems that
were inaccessible with a rigid nephroscope. In this setting, a
Holmium laser and stone basket were used. Temporary drainage
was usually maintained with a 14-F nephrostomy catheter.
All patients were evaluated with pre- and post-operative
computed tomography (CT). The evaluated preoperative stone
parameters included the number, largest diameter, total stone
volume, renometry (complete, partial staghorn, or other), average
Hounsfield units, and degree of hydronephrosis (normal, mild,
moderate, or severe). A complete staghorn stone was defined as a
renal pelvic calculi extending into all major calyceal groups filling
at least 80% of the renal collecting system, and a partial staghorn
stone was defined as a renal pelvic calculi extending into at least
two calyceal groups. Stone volume was calculated by
length6width6depth6p60.52. The total stone volume was the
sum of all stone volumes. The average Hounsfield unit was
measured using the elliptical region of interest incorporated into
the largest stone area in a non-contrast axial image [9]. ‘‘Stone￾free’’ was defined as no evidence of residual stones on
postoperative images for 1 month.
S-ReSC Scoring
The S-ReSC score was calculated by counting the number of
sites involved, regardless of the size and number of stones. The
sites were as follows; the renal pelvis (#1), superior and inferior
major calyceal groups (major calyx and infundibulum) (#2–3), and
anterior and posterior minor calyceal groups of the superior (#4–
5), middle (#6–7), and inferior calyx (#8–9). The anterior and
posterior division was simply divided using the frontal plane of the
kidney. Each minor calyceal group could have more than one
calyx. Minor anatomical variants in the minor calyceal system
were simplified to provide simple and quick scoring and augment
reproducibility. One point was given for each location, resulting in
a maximum of 9 points in total (Fig. 1).
Univariate logistic regression analyses were performed to verify
the effect of stone existence at each site.
Evaluation of Reproducibility
Initially, 1 junior faculty member appraised the S-ReSC score.
This score set was used for the other statistical analyses. To test
intra-observer agreement, this faculty member rescored the
patients 1 month later and was blinded to the first reading. To
assess inter-observer agreement, one senior resident independently

scored the S-ReSC. Inter- and intra-observer agreements were
conservatively evaluated using the weighted kappa (k) with the
squared method.
Validation as a Predictive Method
The SFRs were examined according to the S-ReSC scores. To
evaluate the predictive accuracy, the area under the receiver
operating characteristic curve (AUC) was used. Next, the predicted
probability versus the actual SFR was compared. This examina￾tion was performed by calibration plotting using 200 bootstrap
resamples. To test the clinical utility of the S-ReSC score, a
decision curve analysis (DCA) was constructed. The AUC value
only presents the predictive accuracy, while a DCA depicts the
potential net benefit of the predictive model at each threshold
probability using a graph [10–12].
We also performed univariate logistic regression analyses to
predict the stone-free. The assessed variables were the S-ReSC
score, age, sex, laterality, body mass index, previous treatment,
stone number (1, 2, 3 or .3), largest diameter, total stone volume,
renometry, average Hounsfield units, and degree of hydronephro￾sis. To adjust for other variables, the S-ReSC score and all
significant variables (p,0.05) were included in a multiple logistic
regression analysis.
To evaluate the correlation between the S-ReSC score and the
difficulty and complexity of the surgery, we compared the
operative time, hemoglobin drop (preoperative hemoglobin –
immediate postoperative hemoglobin), and complication rate.
Complications were assessed and scored according to the modified
Clavien classification [13,14].
The data are expressed as the mean 6 standard deviation of the
mean. To compare mean values, one-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA) test was used. When other statistical test was used, we
indicated the method with the results. A p-value ,0.05 was
considered to be statistically significant. All statistical analyses were
performed using R for Windows, version 2.15.2 (http://www.r￾progect.org/). Calibration plot and decision curve were also
generated using this software package.
Results
The basic characteristics of the patients are shown in Table 1.
The overall SFR was 72.3% (112/155). Additional treatments
were used due to residual stones in 11.6% of patients (18/155;
shockwave lithotripsy in 10, retrograde intrarenal surgery in 8, and
secondary PCNL in 2), and the final stone-free was achieved in
76.8% (119/155).
The mean S-ReSC score was 3.1562.12. The S-ReSC scores of
complete (7.1661.36) and partial staghorn stones (4.1761.14)
were significantly higher than the other stone types (2.1761.31,
p,0.001). The effect of stone existence in the anterior calyces on
the SFR was similar to posterior calyces (Table 2).
The weighted kappas for inter- and intra-observer agreement
were 0.832 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.764–0.900) and 0.982
(95% CI 0.971–0.992), respectively, indicating that the scale could
be interpreted as having ‘‘very good reliability’’. The senior
resident (2.7962.02) tended to score lower than the junior faculty
member (paired samples t-test, p,0.001). However, the intra￾observer agreement was almost perfect. Major disagreement
occurred for S-ReSC scores of 4 or higher.

The SFRs according to the S-ReSC scores are shown in Table 3.
The scores could be roughly grouped into low (1–2), medium (3–
4), and high (5–9) score groups. The SFRs were significantly
decreased in the order of the low (96.0%), medium (69.0%), and
high (28.9%) score groups (chi-square test, p,0.001). The AUCs
of the original and 3-tiered S-ReSC score groups were 0.860 (95%
CI 0.793–0.927) and 0.853 (95% CI 0.787–0.919), respectively.
The calibration plot showed a well-calibrated prediction that had
little over- or under-estimation (mean absolute error 0.027) (Fig. 2).
The DCA demonstrated a positive net benefit for almost all
threshold probabilities in the original and 3-tiered S-ReSC score
groups (Fig. 3).
The S-ReSC score, stone number, largest diameter, total stone
volume, renometry, average Hounsfield units, and degree of
hydronephrosis were significantly associated with the stone-free.
Even after adjusting for all other significant variables, the S-ReSC
score was strongly correlated with the stone-free after sPCNL
(Table 4).
The higher S-ReSC score group had a significantly longer
operative time (128.3672.1 min. vs. 153.9678.0 min. vs.
173.4688.6 min, p = 0.013) and larger hemoglobin drop
(0.961.2 mg/dL vs. 1.561.3 mg/dL vs. 1.761.8 mg/dL,
p = 0.003). The complication rates showed an increasing trend
in order to S-ReSC score groups (1.87% [14/75] vs. 28.6% [12/
42] vs. 34.2% [13/38], respectively; p = 0.166). A total of 53
complications occurred in 39 (25.2%) patients. Most complications
were mild and transient, but 7 (4.5%) and 4 (2.6%) patients
experienced grade IIIA and IIIB complications, respectively
(Table 5).

evaluations. Sampaio and colleges described the pelvicalyceal

mid-major calyx. Furthermore, the mid-major calyx typically has
no or a very short infundibulum, and access to the mid-major
calyx is not difficult. Therefore, we decided not to incorporate the

minor calyces varies among individuals, from 5 to 14. For
simplicity and global application, we just classified 6 minor
calyceal groups; the superior, mid, and inferior calyx groups with
anterior and posterior divisions.
If a surgeon can access a certain pelvicalyceal site, they may be
able to remove nearly all of the stones, regardless of their number
or size in that location. The number of stones in different sites is
clearly associated with the S-ReSC score. The stone burden is
commonly expressed as the largest diameter or the estimated total
stone volume [16,17]. However, these methods are potentially
inaccurate because of the complex shape of large renal stones [18].
To improve accuracy, computer software should be used for
volumetric assessment, and mathematical correction methods
should be applied [7,18,19]. Partial or complete staghorn stones
suggest higher stone burden and complexity. Staghorn stones can
be indicated using S-ReSC scores of 3 to 9. The S-ReSC score was
significantly associated with this renometry, and it also described
the complexity more precisely. Commonly accepted predictive
factors, such as stone number, burden, and renometry, were
closely associated with the S-ReSC score. Furthermore, the S￾ReSC score could predict the SFR more accurately than these
commonly accepted predictive factors. Indeed, the predictive
accuracy of the S-ReSC score for the SFR after sPCNL was very
high, with an AUC of 0.860. Additionally, the traditional
predictive factors were overwhelmed by the S-ReSC score by
interaction in a multiple regression analysis.
Several groups have attempted to identify significant predictors
of the stone-free after PCNL [20,21], and they have suggested
stone size, number, location, and pelvicalyceal system anatomy as
predictors. However, a significant predictor is itself not a predictive
tool, and some predictors, such as the pelvicalyceal system
anatomy, are very difficult and time consuming to measure.
Recently, other research groups have reported the development of
prediction models for PCNL [7,8]. However, the proposed models
have many pitfalls, thus they are not widely used. For example,
‘Guy’s stone score’ comprises 4 grades [8]. The grades were
divided by stone number, location, simple versus abnormal
anatomy, and staghorn stone status. The SFRs for grades 1 to 4
were 81%, 72.4%, 35%, and 29%, respectively. Meanwhile, they
did not present the predictive accuracy or a proper validation
process. Furthermore, the grading system was too narrative and
not quantitative and was therefore not widely adopted. ‘Staghorn
morphometry’ is a new clinical classification and predictive model
for PCNL [7,22]. Stone volume and collecting system anatomy
have been assessed using 3-dimensional volume-rendering soft￾ware based on CT urography. The classification of staghorn stones
has been proposed as follows: type 1, total stone volume
,5,000 mm3 and ,5% of stones in unfavorable calyces; type 2,
between type 1 and 3; and type 3, total stone volume
.20,000 mm3 and .10% of stones in unfavorable calyces. An
unfavorable calyx was defined as a calyx with an acute angle (no
specific cut-off point was given) and an infundibular width of less
than 8 mm. This classification is based on an exact measurement,
but it is so complex and requires special software. Therefore, it is
difficult to use in daily practice in most urological clinics. By
contrast, the S-ReSC scoring system does not require additional
software and is easy to use, requiring approximately 15 seconds to
score in our experience.
The ideal prediction model in medicine should be generally
accurate, well calibrated, simple, reproducible, and clinically
meaningful [12,23–25]. The S-ReSC scoring system has been
evaluated with well-conducted validation efforts, and the results
are presented here as the standard methodology [24,25]. We are
cautiously confident that the results are close to an ideal prediction
model. In addition, the S-ReSC scoring system can be used as a
method to define the complexity of a renal stone or surgery. It can
be incorporated into the PCNL report as an overall index of
complexity and can also be used in the case presentation as the
representative index of complexity.
There are several limitations to the present study. This was a
single-center study. Additionally, this is only a proposal of a
predictive method for the SFR after PCNL and a descriptive
method for presenting the complexity of renal stones. Thus, a
larger scale multi-center study should be performed to validate our
results. In our institution, experienced uro-radiologists obtain
percutaneous renal access. If an urologist accesses the kidney, the
stone-free probability and complication rate could be different.
Additionally, if multi-tract or modified PCNL, such as supine
PCNL, is performed, the results of the scoring system should be
first confirmed.
In summary, the S-ReSC scoring system is easy to use and
reproducible. This score accurately predicts the SFR after sPCNL.
Furthermore, this score represents the complexity of surgery.
Thus, the S-ReSC scoring system can be used as a predictive
method to estimate the SFR after sPCNL and as a method for
describing the complexity of renal stones.
