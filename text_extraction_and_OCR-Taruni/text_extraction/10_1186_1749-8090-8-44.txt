Abstract
Background: To review the experience of surgical repair of post-infarction ventricular septal rupture (VSR) and
analyze the associated outcomes and prognostic factors.
Methods: Following approval from the Singhealth Centralised Institutional Review Board (reference: 2011/881/C), a
retrospective review was performed on 38 consecutive patients who had undergone surgical repair of post￾infarction VSR between 1999 and 2011. Continuous variables were expressed as either mean ± standard deviation
or median with 25th and 75th percentiles. These were compared using two-tailed t-test or Mann–Whitney U test
respectively. Categorical variables were compared using chi-square or Fisher’s exact test. To identify predictors of
operative mortality, univariate analysis of perioperative variables followed by multivariate analysis of significant
univariate risk factors was performed. A two-tailed p-value < 0.05 was used to indicate statistical significance.
Results: Mean age was 65.7 ± 9.4 years with 52.6% males. The VSR was anterior in 28 (73.7%) and posterior in 10
patients. Median interval from myocardial infarction to VSR was 1 day (1, 4). Pre-operative intra-aortic balloon pump
was inserted in 37 patients (97.8%). Thirty-six patients (94.7%) underwent coronary angiography.
Thirty-five patients (92.1%) underwent patch repair. Mean aortic cross clamp time was 82 ± 40 minutes and mean
cardiopulmonary bypass time was 152 ± 52 minutes. Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) was performed in 19
patients (50%), with a mean of 1.5 ± 0.7 distal anastomoses. Operative mortality within 30 days was 39.5%.
Univariate analysis identified emergency surgery, New York Heart Association (NYHA) class, inotropic support, right
ventricular dysfunction, EuroSCORE II, intra-operative red cell transfusion, post-operative renal failure and renal
replacement therapy (RRT) as predictors of operative mortality. Multivariate analysis identified NYHA class and post￾operative RRT as predictors of operative mortality.
Ten year overall survival was 44.4 ± 8.4%. Right ventricular dysfunction, LVEF and NYHA class at presentation were
independent factors affecting long-term survival. Concomitant CABG did not influence early or late survival.
Conclusions: Surgical repair of post-infarction VSR carries a high operative mortality. NYHA class at presentation
and post-operative RRT are predictors of early mortality. Right ventricular dysfunction, LVEF and NYHA class at
presentation affect long-term survival. Concomitant CABG does not improve survival.

Background
The reported incidence of acute ventricular septal rupture
(VSR) following acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is 1% to
3% in the era prior to widespread reperfusion therapy [1].
The incidence has since declined to around 0.3% following
the advent of thrombolysis [2].
Despite advances in critical care and prompt surgical
intervention, the incidence of post-infarction VSR has
not changed during the past 2 decades. The mortality
rate of post-infarction VSR remains high and relatively
constant [3]. Reported 30-day mortality rates range from
19 to 54% [3-11].
This study aims to investigate the survival outcome
and prognostic factors associated with surgical repair of
post-infarction VSR at a tertiary referral centre over a 13
year period.
Methods
A retrospective case-note and database review was
performed on consecutive patients who had undergone
surgical repair of post-infarction VSR between January
1999 and December 2011 at our tertiary referral centre.
This study was approved by the Singhealth Centralised
Institutional Review Board (reference: 2011/881/C).
Definitions
Early or operative mortality was defined as death within
30 days of surgery, either in hospital or after hospital
discharge. Renal failure was defined by serum creatinine
levels higher than 1.36 mg/dl or the need for renal re￾placement therapy (RRT). Inotropic support was defined
as infusions of dopamine over 5 mcg/kg/min or any use
of adrenaline, noradrenaline or vasopressin. Emergency
surgery was defined as surgery within 24 hours of diag￾nosis of VSR. Post-operative RRT was in the form of
Continuous Veno-Venous Haemofiltration (CVVH) or
Continuous Veno-Venous Haemodiafiltration (CVVHDF).
Patients
During the period January 1999 to December 2011, 42
consecutive patients were referred to our tertiary cardiac
centre following diagnosis of VSR. Four patients with
anterior VSRs underwent medical therapy as 2 patients
declined surgery and the other 2 were not offered sur￾gery in view of their advanced age (both 91 years old),
multiple medical comorbidities and poor premorbid
functional status. All 4 patients died within 5 days of
diagnosis of VSR. Thirty eight patients underwent surgi￾cal repair of VSR. No patients were treated with percu￾taneous closure devices.
Data was retrospectively collected from patient case
notes and electronic records. Patient demographics and
comorbidities are shown in Table 1. All patients were
followed-up at our institution, with 1 patient lost to
follow-up. Male patients accounted for 52.6%. Mean age
was 65.7 ± 9.4 years (range 45 – 83). The mean age of
females was significantly higher than males (70.0 ± 6.0
vs 61.8 ± 10.3 years, P=0.005). In all patients, a new car￾diac murmur was present in the setting of an ST-segment
elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Transthoracic
echocardiography (TTE) was performed for all patients to
confirm the diagnosis of VSR and exclude the differential
diagnosis of acute mitral regurgitation from papillary
muscle rupture. Evidence of right ventricular (RV) dysfunc￾tion such as RV dilatation or wall motion abnormality was
also diagnosed with pre-operative echocardiography. RV
dysfunction was present in 10 patients (26.3%), of which 7
had presented with inferior MI and 3 with anterior MI.
RV dysfunction was present in 8 of 10 (80%) with posterior
VSRs and 2 of 28 (7.1%) with anterior VSRs, (P<0.0005).
The VSR location was anterior in 28 patients (73.7%) and
posterior in 10 patients (26.3%). One patient had a con￾comitant ventricular free wall rupture. The median time
interval between myocardial infarction and septal rupture
was 1 day (1, 4). The interval between myocardial infarc￾tion and septal rupture was 1 day in 20 patients (52.5%), 2
to 7 days in 13 patients (37.0%) and 8 to 13 days in 4 pa￾tients (10.5%).
Eleven patients (28.9%) had undergone thrombolysis
with either streptokinase or recombinant tissue plasmino￾gen activator. Coronary angiography was performed in 36
patients (94.7%), which showed single vessel disease (SVD)
in 38.8%, double vessel disease (DVD) in 30.6% and triple
vessel disease (TVD) in 30.6% of patients. Within the SVD
group, 10 of 14 patients (71.4%) had total occlusion of the
infarcted artery. Figure 1 shows the distribution of coron￾ary disease according to VSR location.

Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed for the surgically
treated group, using SPSS version 17 statistical software.
Continuous variables were expressed as either mean ±
standard deviation or median with 25th and 75th percen￾tiles, depending on the normality of distribution. These
were compared using two-tailed t-test or Mann–Whitney
U test respectively. Categorical variables, expressed as per￾centages, were analysed with chi-square or Fisher’s exact
test. To identify risk factors predictive of operative mortal￾ity, univariate analysis of perioperative variables was per￾formed. Significant univariate risk factors were examined
using backward logistic regression analysis. Survival func￾tion was presented using Kaplan-Meier survival curves and
comparisons performed with log-rank test. A multivariate
Cox proportional hazard analysis was performed to identify
independent factors affecting long-term survival. A two￾tailed p-value less than 0.05 was used to indicate statistical
significance.
Results
Operative technique
Thirty-seven operations (97.4%) were performed via
median sternotomy. One patient underwent VSR re￾pair through a left anterior thoracotomy. Moderately
hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass was instituted in
all cases. Aortic cross clamping and cold cardioplegic
myocardial protection was applied in 34 patients
(89.5%). Mean cardiopulmonary bypass time was 152 ±
52 minutes and mean aortic cross clamp time was 82 ±
40 minutes.
Single patch closure was performed in 35 cases (92.1%),
using either a Dacron or bovine pericardial patch, adopting
an infarct exclusion technique similar to that of David et al.
[8]. Two cases were repaired by direct suturing without a
patch. In 1 case, the VSR was too extensive and not amen￾able for repair by any method, resulting in an immediate
post-operative death. The ventriculotomy was closed by dir￾ect suture buttressed on felt strips in all patients. Two pa￾tients underwent tricuspid valve repair and one patient
required implantation of a left ventricular assist device due
to inability to wean off cardiopulmonary bypass. Coronary
artery bypass grafting was performed in 19 patients (50.0%),
with a mean of 1.5 ± 0.7 distal anastomoses.
Early outcome
Emergency surgery was performed for 32 patients (84.2%).
An intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) was inserted in 37
patients (97.4%) prior to surgery. The median time interval
between the diagnosis of VSR and surgery was 9 hours
(6, 30). Thirty-six patients (94.7%) underwent VSR repair
within 5 days of diagnosis. Two patients were stabilized
with medical therapy and underwent VSR repair 28 and 82
days after diagnosis respectively.
Fifteen patients died within 30 days of operation, gi￾ving an operative mortality of 39.5%. There was 1 intra￾operative mortality. There was no significant difference in
the duration of aortic cross clamping between survivors
and non-survivors, (90 ± 27 minutes vs 93 ± 34 minutes re￾spectively, P=0.742). Table 2 shows the univariate risk ana￾lysis for predictors of operative mortality. SVD was more
common in anterior VSRs compared to posterior VSRs
(50.0% vs 10.0%, P=0.027).
Pre-existing medical conditions did not significantly affect
early mortality. Significant predictors of operative mortality
identified using univariate analysis included emergency
operation, NYHA class, inotropic support, right ventricular
dysfunction, EuroSCORE II, intra-operative red blood cell
transfusion, post-operative renal failure and RRT. Logistic
regression for multivariate analysis showed that the NYHA
class at presentation and post-operative RRT were inde￾pendent risk factors for operative mortality, as shown in
Table 3.
Post-operative echocardiography diagnosed a residual
shunt of various degrees in 9 patients (23.7%). One patient
had a near complete patch dehiscence requiring early
re-operation on the 8th post-operative day and subsequently
succumbed to multi-organ failure. The other 8 patients
with less severe shunts were managed conservatively.
Late outcome
Follow-up was 97.4% complete with one patient lost to
follow-up. Data regarding follow-up was obtained by

direct assessment during scheduled clinic reviews at our
institution. There were 5 late deaths due to cardiac
causes. Of these, 3 patients died from congestive cardiac
failure and 2 patients died from recurrent myocardial in￾farction, occurring at a median interval of 3.9 months
(3.2 months, 27.8 months) following VSR repair. Three
patients died from non-cardiac related causes. Figure 2
shows the Kaplan-Meier estimate of overall survival, in￾cluding operative deaths. Overall survival at 10 years
was 44.4 ± 8.4%.
Twenty-three patients (60.5%) survived to hospital dis￾charge. The median follow-up period was 41.1 months
(18.2 months, 96.5 months). At latest follow-up, 12 patients
(52.2%) were in NYHA class I, 6 (26.1%) in class II, 3
(13.0%) in class III and 2 (8.7%) in class IV. Six patients
(26.1%) in NYHA II to IV were being treated with at least
one heart failure medication at latest follow-up. Sixteen pa￾tients (69.6%) were free from angina during follow-up. Five
patients (21.7%) had Canadian Cardiovascular Society
(CCS) grade I angina and 2 (8.7%) had grade II angina. All
symptomatic patients received anti-anginal medication. Six
patients who were employed prior to VSR surgery were all
able to resume work following recovery.
Post-discharge echocardiography was performed at a me￾dian interval of 5.9 months (1.4 months, 17.8 months) after
VSR repair. Figure 3 shows the distribution of patients
grouped according to LVEF on follow-up. Nine patients
(39.1%) had LVEF ≤35% during follow-up. None of these
patients received implantable cardiac defibrillators.

Six patients with residual shunts survived to hospital dis￾charge. These residual shunts ranged from 3 mm to 10 mm
in size and were located anteriorly in seven patients (87.5%)
and posteriorly in 1 patient (12.5%). Table 4 summarizes
the characteristics and outcomes of patients with residual
shunts. No patients developed new shunts during follow￾up echocardiographic surveillance.
Table 5 shows the results of multivariate Cox regression
analysis of factors affecting late survival. Factors identified
as having a significant negative impact on late survival were
NYHA Class IV at the time of presentation, RV dysfunction
and lower LVEF.
Discussion
The availability of early reperfusion therapy for myocar￾dial infarction has led to the declining incidence of post￾infarction VSRs. Despite this trend, VSR remains one of
the most challenging conditions encountered by cardiac
surgeons today.
The 30-day operative mortality in this series was 39.5%,
similar to the rates of 34% to 37% reported in other series
[4-7]. Lower operative mortality rates ranging from 19% to
23% have been reported [8-11]. Univariate analysis identi￾fied emergency operation as a predictor of early mortality
in this series, which was similar to the findings of other
authors [4,6,9,10]. The same authors also identified the dur￾ation of aortic cross clamp as a predictor of early mortality
but this association was not demonstrated in this study. In￾creased cardiopulmonary bypass time has also been
reported as a predictor of operative mortality but this asso￾ciation was not evident in this series [11-14].
The optimal timing of surgical repair for VSRs is crit￾ical. A longer interval before surgery has been reported
to be associated with improved survival [15]. Despite
this, only 2 of our 38 patients remained sufficiently
stable in NYHA class II to permit delayed surgery. Al￾though both these patients survived with good outcomes
and returned to NYHA class I after recovery, we reserve
delayed VSR repair only for a carefully selected group of
patients who remain haemodynamically stable.
We adopted the single patch technique in 35 cases
(92.1%). The incidence of post-operative residual shunt
was 23.7%, comparable to the incidence of 24 to 26%
described in other series in which a variety of techniques
were used [6,16]. An alternative double patch technique
has been reported to decrease the incidence of residual
shunt from 11% to 0% [17].
We routinely perform coronary angiography for all
haemodynamically stable patients diagnosed with VSR at
Figure 2 Kaplan-Meier estimate of overall survival, including
operative deaths.

our centre. This provides an opportunity for the inser￾tion of IABP under fluoroscopic guidance. In this series,
coronary angiography was performed in all except for 2
patients who presented in extremis. SVD was signifi￾cantly more common in anterior VSRs compared to pos￾terior VSRs in this series, similar to the findings of
Davies et al. [18]. In the group with SVD, 71.4% had
total occlusion of the infarcted artery. Reported figures
range from 57% to 82% [2,19].
Lundblad et al. [20] found that concomitant CABG
during VSR repair reduces both early and late mortality
when compared with patients with unbypassed coronary
artery disease. Although there was no significant differ￾ence in early mortality within other series, mid to long￾term survival benefit has been reported [16,20-22].
In a review of recent literature, Perotta et al. [23]
reported an improvement of mortality rates from 26.3%
in those without CABG to 21.2% in those who had
undergone CABG. These results applied to patients with
multi-vessel disease where complete myocardial revascu￾larization was achieved by bypassing all stenotic coron￾ary arteries supplying non-infarcted areas. Actuarial
survival at five years from this series ranged from 29% to
72%. In this study, there was no statistically significant
early or long-term survival advantage for patients who
had undergone concomitant CABG. Other authors have
reported similar findings [4,6,7,10,11,15,17,24]. Despite
the lack of significant survival benefit associated with
concomitant CABG in their studies, some authors advo￾cate concomitant CABG during VSR repair as long as it
can be performed safely [4,5,15,17]. The aim is to reduce
further ischaemic risk associated with multi-vessel cor￾onary artery disease by improving collateral flow to the
myocardium.
Similar to the findings of Moore et al. [25], our data
shows that RV dysfunction has a negative impact on early
and late survival. As RV failure ensues, the left-sided cardiac
chambers are unable to fill, leading to biventricular failure.
This exacerbates the low cardiac output state, contributing
towards a higher mortality rate.
Percutaneous closure has been increasingly used in
patients with postinfarction VSRs, initially in patients with
recurrent ventricular septal defects (VSDs) after primary
surgical repair, but more recently as primary therapy in
patients with acute VSR and high surgical risk, or as a tem￾porizing bridge to surgery [26]. Ventricular septal occluder
devices were initially developed for percutaneous closure of
congenital VSDs. Percutaneous deployment of an occluding
device may be precluded by the geometry and location of
the VSR, or interference from valvular apparatus, especially
in posterior VSRs. The highest technical success has been
reported with the Amplatzer device (AGA Medical Corp,
Plymouth, MN), with procedural success rates ranging
from 86% to 89% [27,28]. Lee et al. [29] recently described
the use of a hybrid approach with the advantage of allowing
direct manipulation of the Amplatzer device. This approach

prevents interference of the valve apparatus, avoiding the
need to perform ventriculotomy in an already infarcted
ventricle.
Large (≥15 mm) VSRs should undergo immediate surgery
as these are prone to device embolization or residual VSR.
Amplatzer closure can be used as definitive therapy for
small or medium VSRs. It can also be used to stabilize
patients and allow myocardial fibrosis, thus facilitating
delayed surgical correction [27]. Despite a less invasive
technique, procedural mortality and morbidity are high,
especially in patients with cardiogenic shock (mortality in
cardiogenic shock 88% vs. 38% non-shock P<0.001) [26].
Overall 30-day mortality rates for percutaneous closure
range from 28% to 65% [26-28]. Other procedure-related
major complications include residual shunting, left ven￾tricular rupture and device embolization. The incidence of
residual shunts ranges from 8.3% to 13.8%, much lower
than 73% reported in an earlier series [26-28].
Ventricular assist devices (VADs) are useful adjuncts for
the treatment of VSRs in the setting of univentricular or
biventricular failure, either preoperatively as a bridge to sur￾gery or postoperatively following VSR repair. Mechanical
circulatory support with VADs allows restoration of periph￾eral organ perfusion and provides an opportunity for recov￾ery and maturation of the infarcted myocardium before
secondary VSR repair. Applying this concept, a staged
approach of initial left ventricular or biventricular mechan￾ical support with an implantable left ventricular assist de￾vice (LVAD) or biventricular assist device (BiVAD) followed
by secondary VSR repair has been described [30,31]. Previ￾ously, BiVAD support without VSR repair has been de￾scribed as a bridge-to-transplantation approach [32].
La Torre et al. [33] reported a similar bridge to surgery
strategy in their series of patients with posterior VSRs
using the Impella Recover (ABIOMED, Inc, Danvers,
Mass), a percutaneous left ventricular assist device (LVAD).
Utilizing an intravascular microaxial blood pump inserted
in the femoral artery, successful reduction in left-to-right
shunting and increase in cardiac output was achieved while
awaiting VSR repair about 3 weeks later. Despite suc￾cessful surgical repair of VSR, some patients with extensive
infarction and persistent ventricular failure remain in car￾diogenic shock and require VAD support to maintain
physiologic haemodynamics. Implantable LVADs have
been used successfully to bridge these patients to cardiac
transplantation [34].
This is a retrospective descriptive study with inherent
biases in data collection. Due to the relatively rare
occurrence of post-infarction VSR, the small sample size
underpowered the statistical analysis and could have
limited the number of statistically significant variables. A
prospective multi-centre study incorporating a larger
sample size would be useful to assess the prognostic
value of the risk factors identified.
Conclusions
Post-infarction VSR remains a serious and challenging
complication of acute myocardial infarction in the mod￾ern surgical era. Surgical repair is associated with an
operative mortality of 39.5%. Overall survival at 10 years
is 44.4% ± 8.4%. The NYHA class at presentation and
the need for post-operative RRT are independent predic￾tors of early mortality. Right ventricular dysfunction,
lower LVEF and NYHA class IV symptoms at presenta￾tion are predictors of poor long-term survival. Concomi￾tant CABG during VSR repair does not confer a
significant survival advantage.
