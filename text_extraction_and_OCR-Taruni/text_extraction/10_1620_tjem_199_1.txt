advantage of preservation of functional lung
parenchyma (Gaissert et al. 1996). These pro￾cedureshavebeenacceptedascurativeandsafe
for lung cancer (Kawahara et al.1994). Anas￾tomoticcomplications following bronchoplastic
procedure are critical and frequentlyfatal,and
theeffect ofanti-neoplasticagentsand thoracic
irradiation on healing ofbronchialanastomosis
remains unclear. Previous experimental
studies in rats showed that preoperative
cisplatin-etoposide treatment (PE) did not
impairwound healing ofbronchialanastomosis
even in thepresenceofmild leukopenia and/or
afterasufficientintervalwasallowedforrecov￾ery from myelosuppression (Shirafuji et al.
2001).
In the present study, we examined the
effects ofpreoperative thoracic irradiation and
concomitant PE onwound healing at thesiteof
bronchial anastomosis in rats.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Experimental animals
Male Wistar rats (n＝126, age, 8 weeks)
weighing 270 to 300g (Charles River Japan,
Yokohama) were used for assessment of the
woundhealing. Allratsusedinthisstudywere
maintainedintheAnimalsCenterofBiomedical
Research,NagasakiUniversitySchoolofMedi￾cine, and received humane care in compliance
with theguidelinesoftheAnimalCareandUse
Committee of Nagasaki University. These
procedures conformed to the guidelines estab￾lished bythe National Institutes ofHealth and
published in the Guide for the Care and Use
Laboratory animals (NIH Publication No.85
-23).
Experimental design
Rats were divided into two experimental
groups (n＝54 each), and a control group (n＝
18). Furthermore,withineachexperiment,rats
weredivided into threesubgroups,each consist￾ing of 18 rats. Experimental groups were as
follows:rats of the first group represented the
control group, those of the second group
received intravenous cisplatin and etoposide
(chemotherapy［CT］group),whileratsofgroup
3 received thoracic irradiation consisting of a
single dose of 20Gy (irradiation［IR］group),
andratsofgroup4receivedthoracicirradiation
of a single dose of 20Gy and simultaneous
intravenous injection ofcisplatin and etoposide
(chemotherapy and irradiation ［CT＋IR］
group). Surgery was subsequently performed
in all rats. In experiment 1, surgery was per￾formed 3days after preoperativedrug adminis￾tration and thoracicirradiation havebeen com￾pleted (Fig.1). In experiment 2, surgery was
performed 7daysafterpreoperativetreatments
toallowforexaminationoftheeffectsofrecov￾ery of myelosuppression on wound healing.
The interval was counted from the last drug
administration day or thoracic irradiation day

to the operation day. All rats were assessed
after 3,5,and 7 days after surgery(seebelow).
Preoperative drug administration
Thedoseofcisplatinwas4mg/kg andthat
ofetoposide4.8mg/kg. Cisplatinwasadminis￾trated via the tail vein on the first day and
etoposidewas injected on the first,second,and
third days. The selected doses were based on
previous studies, and represented LD욼웅
(Karppinen and Myllarniemi 1970;Warram
1975;Ward and Fauvie 1976).
Thoracic irradiation
Ratswereanesthetizedwithintraperitoneal
sodium pentobarbital (50mg/kg). Irradiation
field was determined between the upper and
lower edges of the sternal incision. The left
and right boundaries oftheradiationfield were
therespectivemid-sternallines. Anatomically,
this field included the trachea, left and right
mainstembronchi,bothlungs,esophagus,heart,
thymus, vertebral column and the spinal cord.
The rest of the body was shielded with lead
during irradiation. Irradiation was performed
bymeansofthermoluminescent dosimetersand
film densitometryinseparateanimals. Irradia￾tion was delivered in a vertical beam from a
250-kVp X-rayunit (EXS-300,Toshiba Corpora￾tion,Tokyo). Theequipment was operated at
15mA and 200kV. Beam was filtered by 0.5
mmAl. Thedoseratewas 0.85Gy/min at the
focus skin distance of50cm.
Operative procedure
Allratswereanesthetizedwithanintraper￾itoneal injection of pentobarbital sodium (50
mg/kg), incubated and ventilated at a tidal
volume of 10ml/kg and respiratory rate of 90
breaths/min using a respirator (SN-480-7,
Shimano Corporation, Tokyo). Using clean
butnonsterilesurgicaltechnique,a4-cmincision
was made on the left chest wall and thor￾acotomywas performed at the fourth intercos￾tal space. A left main stem bronchial transec￾tion and bronchial end-to-end anastomosis was
carried out under a surgicalmicroscopeusing 8
-0 polypropylene sutures (Ethicon, Somerville,
NJ, USA). Anastomosis of the cartilaginous
and the membranous portions was performed
using 6 continuous and 4 interrupted sutures,
respectively. Thesamesurgerywasperformed
inthecontrolrats,whichdidnotreceivechemo￾therapyor radiotherapy.
Evaluation
Bodyweightwasrecordeddaily. Allsigns
of illness, reaction to treatment, and deaths
were recorded during follow-up period. Rats
were sacrificed bycardiac puncture at day3,5
or 7after operation (n＝6rats,each). Cardiac
blood samples were obtained by open thor￾acotomytechnique and then placed into hepar￾inized syringes. Complete blood counts and
albumin contents,total proteins in serum were
examinedat day3,day5andday7. Bronchial
anastomoticareawasharvestedatpostmortem,
and the surrounding tissues adherent to the
anastomosiswereleft untouched microsurgical￾ly. Theright main stem bronchus and theleft
main bronchus distal to the anastomotic site
were clamped after washing out the
intraluminal air. The trachea was connected
to an infusion pump and a manometer (RMP￾6004S, Nihon Kohden, Tokyo). The pressure
was increased with an infusion rate of 0.8ml/
min,whichwasrecordedpolygraphically. The
bursting pressurewas measured and thesiteof
rupturewas noted.
Ifthesiteofrupturewasoutsidethesuture
line,thebursting pressurewasmeasured at this
point. The anastomotic segment was cleaned
from surrounding tissue after assessment of
bursting pressure,then the cartilaginous or the
membranousportionwasdissected. Themem￾branous portion containing the suture line was
collected foranalysisofhydroxyprolinecontent
as a parameter for collagen. The samples
were frozen immediately and stored at －80°C.
These were evaporated to dryness in vacuum

for 48hour, and weighed. The samples were
hydrolyzed in 0.5ml 20% HCl at 110°C for 24
hours, and subsequently evaporated in a rota￾tory vacuum evaporator at 60°C. They were
subsequently redissolved in phosphate buffer 1
ml/kg dryweight,and hydroxyproline content
was determined using an auto amino acid anal￾yzer (JLC-300,Nippon Denshi,Tokyo).
Histopathological examination
Forhistopathologicalexamination,thecar￾tilaginous portion was fixed in 4% paraformal￾dehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (4% PFA￾PBS, pH 7.4) overnight for hematoxylin-eosin
staining and Masson-trichrome staining.
Statistical analysis
Group values were expressed as the
mean±S.D. Differences between experimental
groups and the control were tested for
significance with the ranksum two-sample test
(Mann-WhitneyʼsU-test)orchi-squaretest,with
significance levels set at 5%.
RESULTS
Experiment 1 (preoperative treatment 3 days
before surgery)
General observation. All animals showed
weight loss during postoperative period. Rats
of CT＋IR group and CT group showed a
significant weight loss compared with CONT
group and IR group (p＜0.05)(Fig.2). Noneof
the rats had complications arising from anas￾tomotic failure or related to thoracic wound
healing.
Peripheral blood. Significant leukopenia
was noted in CT and CT＋IR groups at day 3
compared to the control and IR groups (p＜
0.05). However, the leukocyte counts recover￾edgradually,andwerealreadyimprovedatday
7 after surgery (Fig.3). The platelet counts
showed same change as leukocyte counts.
There were no significant differences in total
protein counts contents among thefour groups.
Bursting pressure. At postoperativeday3,
the bursting pressures were 201±80mmHg in
IR group and 188±82mmHg in CT＋IR group,
which were lower than in the control (244±46
mmHg)and CT (275±69 mmHg)groups,albeit

Histopathological findings. H & E staining
ofthe tissue sections obtained from the site of
anastomosis showed excellent growth of the
submucosal connective tissue in the control
group at days 3 and 5. In contrast, the sub￾mucosal connective tissue showed no signs of
regeneration,and defects were seen in the sub￾mucosaltissuein IR group at days3and 5(Fig.

IR and CT＋IR groupsat day7compared with
the control group (data not shown). Masson￾trichrome staining of the anastomotic tissues
showed lack of maturity of granulocyte tissue
and extracellular matrix in IR and CT＋IR
groups at days 3 and 5 (data not shown).

to 20% ofpatientssurviving 3years(Martiniet
al. 1980;Pearson et al. 1982;Cybulsky et al.
1992). Attempts to prolong survival following
surgicalresectionbyinductionchemotherapyor
by a combination of chemotherapy and radio￾therapy have improved the median survival
time and rate in randomized clinical trials
(Dillman et al. 1990;Le Chevalier et al. 1991;
Rosellet al.1994). However,adverseeffectsof
acute irradiation on healing of the bronchial
anastomosishavebeendocumentedbothexperi￾mentallyandclinically(Tsubotaetal.1975;Inui
et al.1993). Although preoperativechemother￾apy combined with radiotherapy appears to
influencepostoperativetracheobronchialwound
healing,fewstudieshaveexamined such effects
in detail. Therefore, our study examined the
effects of preoperative irradiation and anti￾neoplastic agents on bronchial anastomotic
healing in rats.
Werecentlyshowedthatpreoperativethor￾acicirradiationclearlyimpairedbronchialanas￾tomotic healing in rats treated with a single
doseof30Gyand40Gyat day7beforesurgery
(Masao 2001). Several adverse effects on hea￾ling werenotedwhentheradiationdoseexceed￾ed 30 or 40Gy. In our experimental study,
thereweresignificant differencesinthebursting
pressure and histopathological findings among
rats that received an IR dose of 30 or 40Gy
compared with 20Gy at day 7 after operation.
Since we wanted to examine the synergistic
adverse effects of PE on healing of bronchial
anastomosis,when simultaneouslyadministered
at the time of irradiation, the experiment was
designedthereforetouseadoseofonly20Gyin
this study. According to the linear-quadratic
concept andassuming anα/βratioof20Gyfor
acuteeffects,theextrapolatedtolerancedoseof
25Gyand 50Gyareapproximatelythebiologi￾cal equivalent for acute effects with a single
dose of 20Gy and 30Gy, respectively (Fowler
1989;Tsubiana 1990). Clinical and experimen￾taldatahavesuggestedthatbronchialcomplica￾tionsseem to increasewhen preoperativeradia￾tion dose exceeds 35 to 40Gy (Tsubota et al.
1975;Inui et al.1993).
Preoperativethoracicirradiation and simul￾taneous administration of PE have shown
acceptabletoxicityand relativelygood survival
results(Yasharet al.1992;Bonomi1993). Sev￾eralstudiesusedcisplatinasaradiosensitizerin
combination with radiotherapy(Ruckdeschelet
al. 1986;Bunn 1989). However, our results
showednosignificant differencesinthebursting
pressure between the irradiation group and
radiochemotherapygroup. Thus,PEcombined
with irradiation does not seem to havea syner￾gistic adverse effect on wound healing ofbron￾chial anastomosis in rats. On the other hand,
ourresultsshowedasignificantdifferenceinthe
bursting pressure between the irradiation and
chemotherapy groups, indicating that thoracic
irradiation produces more serious adverse
effects on wound healing (compared to chemo￾therapy),at least in our rat model.
Clinically,significant leukopeniawasnoted
at 2 or 3 weeks after chemotherapy, and
recovered gradually, and were already im￾proved at 3 or 4weeks. But,in our rat model,
Significant leukopenia was noted in CT and
CT＋IR groups at day 6 after chemotherapy
and recovered gradually,and were alreadyim￾proved at day 10 after chemotherapy. The
platelet counts showed same change as leuko￾cyte counts. We expect that regeneration
speed in bone marrows of rats was equal to
double that ofhuman.
Inourstudy,thebursting pressureinirradi￾ation and radiochemotherapy groups was
significantlylower than thecontroland chemo￾therapy group at day 5 (p＜0.05, each). His￾topathological examination ofthe site of anas￾tomosis using H & E stained sections showed
lack ofsubmucosal connective tissue regenera￾tion and defectsin thesubmucosal tissuein the
irradiationgroupandradiochemotherapygroup
at postoperative days 3 and 5. However, the
healing process was not delayed in the latter
two groups compared with the control at pos￾Effect of Preoperative Radiochemotherapy on Wound Healing 9

toperative day 7. The cytotoxic effects of
chemotherapy and irradiation include among
others,thepreventionoffibroblastproliferation,
collagensynthesis,anddepositionofcollagenon
the anastomotic line, which adversely affect
wound healing and anastomotic breaking
strength (Kuzu et al. 1999). Previous studies
reportedthatdepletionofmacrophagesisoneof
the most important causes of impaired wound
healing in chemotherapy, in addition to other
mechanisms (Shirafuji et al. 2001). T
lymphocytes commence to accumulate in the
wound area at 5 days after injury (Barendsen
1982). Inourstudy,depletionofleukocytesand
macrophageswasnot seen in irradiation group,
comparedwiththecontrolgroup. It ispossible
that impairment ofthehealing processcouldbe
due to another important factor. The healing
of bronchial anastomosis is closely related to
regional mucosal blood flow. Preoperative
irradiation decreases bronchial mucosal blood
flow and adverselyaffects the healing of bron￾chialanastomosis. Intheearlypost-irradiation
period,tissueshowsreactivecongestion,edema,
andinhibitionofcapillaryproliferation. These
changes may cause a reduction in bronchial
mucosal blood flow particularly during the
acute period. However, recovery of bronchial
mucosal blood flow seems to occur within 8 to
10 days in the human bronchus (Yamamoto et
al.2000). Our studysuggested recovery ofthe
healing processin bronchialanastomosiswithin
7 days based on measurements of the bursting
pressureand histopathologicalfindings. These
results emphasize the importance of careful
management ofthehealing ofanastomoticarea
in the early stages (the first five postoperative
days).
Hydroxyproline makes up to 10% of col￾lagen, and since it is found only sparingly in
other proteins,it is used as an indirect marker
for collagen contents (Hoshi et al. 1993;
Dominguez et al. 1996). Our results showed
that hydroxyproline contents increased in
irradiated rats, although this result did not
parallel the bursting pressure. Several studies
reportedsignificantlyhighhydroxyprolinelevels
in irradiated group than thecontrol(Jahnson et
al.1995;Dominguez et al. 1996). Whether the
collagen in theirradiated tissues differs in type
or structure from that of non-irradiated bowel,
the exact reason for the higher hydroxyproline
concentrations is unknown at present. Col￾lagen concentrations per unit weight should be
considered with caution sincetheymaychange
asa consequenceofchangesin non-collagenous
substances. Since no distinct correlation have
been demonstrated between development of
mechanical strength and collagen levels in the
healing anastomosis, attention should not be
restricted to a description of the quality of
collagen present (Hendriks and Mastboom
1990). Further studies examining collagen
maturation and structural organization are
needed.
In conclusion,wehavedemonstrated in the
present study that the healing of bronchial
anastomosis was markedly delayed in early
postoperative days in rats that had received
radiochemotherapy. There was a significant
differenceinwoundhealing processatpostoper￾ativeday5inradiochemotherapygroup,sugges￾ting that further exhaustive evaluation of this
therapeuticregimen,particularlythatofirradia￾tion,is necessary.
