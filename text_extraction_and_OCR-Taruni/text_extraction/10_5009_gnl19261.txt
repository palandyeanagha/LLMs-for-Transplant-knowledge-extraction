Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is a chronic inflammatory liver 
disease, characterized by the elevation of aminotransferas￾es, presence of anti-nuclear antibody or anti-smooth muscle 
antibody, elevated immunoglobulin G (IgG), and interface 
hepatitis/plasma-lymphocytic inflammation based on his￾tology. Recent epidemiological studies have indicated an 
increasing trend in the prevalence of AIH worldwide, espe￾cially in male patients; this trend may suggest the alteration 
of environmental triggers of disease onset over time. As no 
disease-specific biomarker or histological finding is currently 
available, AIH requires a clinical diagnosis, and a validated 
diagnostic scoring system with acceptable specificity and 
sensitivity has been proposed. Regarding treatment, cor￾ticosteroids and azathioprine are recommended, and in 
those who exhibit an incomplete response or those who 
are intolerant to these drugs, second-line therapy, such as 
mycophenolate mofetil, is considered. Overall, the long-term 
outcome is excellent in patients with complete biochemical 
responses, while life-long maintenance treatment may be 
required since the cessation of immunosuppressive agents 
frequently leads to the relapse of the disease. Acute-onset 
AIH does occur, and the diagnosis is very challenging due 
to the lack of serum autoantibodies or elevated IgG. The 
unmet needs include earlier diagnosis, intervention with dis￾seminated clinical practice guidelines, and recognition and 
improvement of patients’ health-related quality of life with 
the development of novel corticosteroid-free treatment regi￾mens. (Gut Liver 2020;14:430-438)

INTRODUCTION
Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is a chronic liver disease of 
unknown etiology in which autoimmune-mediated relativities 
against hepatocytes are thought to play a crucial role.1
 While 
middle-aged women have the highest risk for developing AIH, 
patients in childhood or adolescence are not uncommon. The 
elevation of transaminases, detectable autoantibodies, such as 
anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA) or anti-smooth muscle antibod￾ies (SMA), elevation of serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels, 
and interface hepatitis or plasma cell infiltration in liver histol￾ogy are characteristic features of AIH.2
 However, since there 
is currently no specific biomarker for the diagnosis of AIH, 
criteria consisting of several items are used for diagnosis.3,4 AIH 
responds very well to immunosuppressive drugs, and cortico￾steroids are the first-line treatment.5,6 While the overall survival 
of patients with AIH is comparable to that of those in the gen￾eral population when the treatment response is favorable, the 
outcome is poor in patients with more than two relapses, even 
with corticosteroid treatment during the clinical course.7
 In this 
review, we summarize recent studies in terms of the epidemiol￾ogy, etiology, diagnosis, and treatment of AIH, and finally dis￾cuss the unmet needs in AIH as a future perspective.
EPIDEMIOLOGY: AN INCREASING TREND
AIH commonly affects middle-aged women, but occurrence 
in childhood or adolescence is observed.8,9 Worldwide, the peak 
incidence of AIH is around 50 to 60 years of age, and the high￾est incidence was observed around 60 to 70 years in both South 
Korea and Japan.9,10 Similarly to other autoimmune diseases, 
female preponderance is distinct in AIH, and the male-to-female 
ratio is around 1:4 to 1:6.
The burden of AIH appears to be increasing worldwide, and 
the point prevalence reported in the published literature after

2000 is shown in Fig. 1.
8,11-18 The point prevalence of AIH is 
reported to be 10 to 25 per 100,000 population in European 
countries, and 5 to 25 in the Asia-Pacific region. Among these, 
epidemiological studies were serially conducted twice in Sweden 
and Japan.11,18,19 Although the study design, study area, and case 
findings were different, the point prevalence in Sweden was 
10.7 and 17.3 in 2003 and 2009, respectively, indicating a 1.7-
fold increase in 6 years.11,18 Likewise, in Japan, the prevalence of 
AIH was 8.7 and 23.9 in 2004 and 2016, respectively, and thus 
tripled over a 12-year period.19 It is also of note that although 
AIH was thought to be less frequent in Asia, the point preva￾lence recently reported is similar to that of the rest of the world 
(Fig. 1).
The male-to-female ratio of the population with AIH is con￾sidered to have changed over time, indicating a relative increase 
in the number of male patients. In Japan, the male-to-female 
ratio was 1:7 in 2004 and 1:4 in 2016.19 Similarly, other recent 
epidemiological studies of AIH indicate that the male-to-female 
ratio is approximately 1:4 to 1:6 for AIH,8,13,17,20 which is signifi￾cantly higher than that reported previously (approximately 1:9 
to 1:10). 
ETIOLOGY: PERSPECTIVE FROM THE INTERACTION OF 
GENETICS AND ENVIRONMENT 
AIH is multifactorial and involves the interaction of both 
genetic background and environmental triggers; accordingly, 
environmental insult in genetically susceptible individuals may 
result in aberrant immunological reactions and lead to autoim￾mune-mediated injury to hepatocytes. Familial clustering of AIH 
is frequently reported, even though the risk of AIH in the family 
is relatively low;21 this indicates the importance of both genetic 
determinants and environmental triggers. To date, numerous 
susceptible loci for AIH in the human leucocyte antigen (HLA) 
and non-HLA region have been identified, and a genome-wide 
association study (GWAS) in the Netherlands determined HLA￾DRB1*0301 and DRB1*0401 to be the most relevant susceptible 
genotypes for AIH, while SH2B3 and CARD10 (genes in the 
non-HLA region) were shown to be significantly associated with 
AIH.22 Nevertheless, the associations of non-HLA loci have not 
yet been confirmed by other GWAS, indicating a strong contri￾bution of HLA loci to disease susceptibility. Furthermore, recent 
epidemiological studies have suggested a relative importance 
of environmental triggers.19 As described, an increased trend of 
the prevalence of AIH, especially in males, has been observed 
worldwide. This might be explained by a better awareness and 
recognition of AIH among physicians, while novel environmen￾tal factors contributing to the susceptibility of AIH and shared 
by both Europe and Asia-Pacific areas, and both sexes, might 
play a more crucial role in AIH. A well-designed case-control 
study is warranted to seek and identify environmental triggers 
in lifestyle, food, and beverages, or in chemicals, antibiotics, 
and xenobiotics, which trigger innate and adaptive immune 
responses leading to a breakdown of tolerance against hepato￾cytes.19
DIAGNOSIS: A CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS
1. Presentation
In typical cases, the presentation of AIH is insidious and 
patients with decompensated symptoms are rather rare, while 
the majority of patients with AIH have an acute-onset with 
general fatigue or jaundice, as described below. The elevation of 
transaminases, detectable autoantibodies (ANA or SMA), and el￾evated serum IgG level are common features captured by blood 
testing. Besides ANA or SMA, liver kidney/microsome (LKM)-
1 antibody or soluble liver antigen is occasionally detectable 
in AIH, and the presence of LKM-1 characterizes type 2 AIH, 
while detectable ANA or SMA is a feature of type 1 AIH. A liver 
biopsy is required for the diagnosis of AIH, and typical findings

of histology include interface hepatitis and lymphocytic/lym￾phoplasmocytic infiltrates (Fig. 2), in addition to emperipolesis, 
and hepatic rosette formation. However, the detection of ANA 
and SMA is not specific for AIH, and these histological findings 
are occasionally observed in other etiologies of hepatitis. Indeed, 
Gurung et al.
23 recently demonstrated that while Kupffer cell hy￾aline granules, prominence of plasma cells in portal tracts, and 
plasma-lymphocytic inflammation are significantly associated 
with AIH, rosette formation and emperipolesis lacked signifi￾cance when compared to chronic hepatitis of other etiologies. 
Thus, no biomarkers with high sensitivity and specificity (such 
as anti-mitochondrial antibodies in primary biliary cholangitis) 
are available for AIH, and a combination of clinical parameters 
as diagnostic criteria has been used for the diagnosis of AIH.
Among a number of histological findings of AIH, liver fibrosis 
staging is crucial for predicting long-term outcome. Although 
close monitoring of fibrosis staging is essential during the clini￾cal course, it is not feasible to carry out serial liver biopsies, and 
the role of noninvasive indices for fibrosis staging has been paid 
more attention to recently. These indices include biochemical 
calculation scores, such as the aspartate aminotransferase/plate￾let ratio (APRI) or fibrosis index based on the 4 factors (FIB-4),24
Mac-2 binding protein glycosylation isomer,25 magnetic reso￾nance elastography,26 and transient elastography.27,28 A recent 
systematic review indicated that transient elastography had a 
good performance for determining significant fibrosis, advanced 
fibrosis, and cirrhosis, whereas APRI and FIB-4 showed poor 
performance.29
2. Diagnostic criteria
The diagnostic criteria for AIH were created as a diagnostic 
scoring system by the International AIH Group in 1993,30 and 
revised in 1999.3
 This scoring system was developed for the 
purification of patients with AIH for clinical research and trials, 
and was considered too complicated for daily use. In addition, 
atypical AIH patients (anti-mitochondrial antibody positive 
AIH or anti-hepatitis C virus antibody positive AIH), who are 
required to be treated as typical AIH cases in daily practice, tend 
to be excluded by the deduction of points. Thereafter, a simpli￾fied scoring system to ease clinical application was proposed in 
2008;4
 this system consisted of only four items (Table 1): Auto￾antibodies (ANA or SMA), IgG, liver histology, and the absence 
of viral hepatitis. This is user-friendly and easy to determine 
whether corticosteroid treatment should be commenced or not. 
Even though retrospective, high specificity and specificity of 
the simplified scoring system in the diagnosis of AIH has been 
validated.31,32 A recent systematic review suggested that the sim￾plified scoring system also provided high specificity and moder￾ate sensitivity for the diagnosis of pediatric AIH.33 On the other 
hand, in a Korean cohort of patients with AIH (n=343; mean 
age, 52.8 years old), definite/probable AIH according to the re￾vised and simplified criteria were found to be 24.8%/65.4% and 
34.4%/38.5%, respectively, and the concordance rate was quite 
low (38.8%), with modest sensitivity of the simplified criteria.10
Regarding the diagnosis of AIH, making a diagnosis of AIH 
after progression to a cirrhotic stage is common in both de￾veloped and developing countries. In a cohort in Pakistan and 
India, 84% and 71% of patients had evidence of clinical cir￾rhosis, respectively, with evident symptoms such as jaundice 
or abdominal distension.34 Moreover, a Korean study indicated 
that 22.7% of patients were cirrhotic at the stage of diagnosis.10
Even in a multicenter study in the United Kingdom, 21% of 
patients had clinical decompensation and/or a MELD (Model 
for End-Stage Liver Disease) score >15 at presentation, and de￾layed diagnosis (time from first abnormal liver tests to diagnosis 
was ≥1 year) was observed in 19% of patients.35 It is extremely 
important to have a suspicion of AIH in cases with elevated 
transaminases and make a diagnosis of AIH at an earlier fibrotic 
stage, prior to progression to cirrhosis.
TREATMENT: CORTICOSTEROIDS AND BEYOND
1. Goal and indication of treatment for AIH 
The aim of treatment in AIH is to achieve complete biochemi￾cal and histological remission, and prevent further progression 
of liver fibrosis. Complete biochemical remission is associated 
with the normalization of both serum alanine aminotransferase 
(ALT) and IgG levels. Whereas increased mortality is observed 
in AIH patients with cirrhosis compared to those without cirrho￾sis,36 histological regression of fibrosis, as well as an improved 
long-term outcome will be attained by complete biochemical 
remission.37,38 Although the patients with AIH who should be 
treated are poorly defined, those with advanced or active AIH 
(advanced fibrosis, cirrhosis, ALT ≥3 ×upper limit of normal 
[ULN]) are expected to have a poor outcome and absolute indi￾cation for treatment. On the other hand, patients with mild dis￾ease (ALT <3 ×ULN and mild or no fibrosis on histology) may 
not require prompt treatment, and be closely monitored until

elevation of ALT and/or IgG.5
2. First-line medical treatment
Immunosuppressive treatment, consisting of either cortico￾steroids or a combination of corticosteroids and azathioprine, 
has been shown to improve the long-term outcome of patients 
with AIH,39 and is consistently recommended as a first-line 
treatment.5,40 While the American Association for the Study 
of the Liver Disease guidelines recommend either prednisone 
monotherapy (60 mg/day) or a combination of prednisone (30 
mg/day) and azathioprine (50 mg/day),40 the European Associa￾tion for the Study of the Liver (EASL) guidelines suggest 0.5–1 
mg/kg/day predniso(lo)ne as initial treatment, followed by a 
50 mg/day azathioprine add-on.5
 Indeed, the recommended 
starting dose of predniso(lo)ne, 0.5–1 mg/kg/day, is somewhat 
ambiguous and leaves room for variation. Recently, Pape et 
al.
41 retrospectively investigated whether a higher (≥0.5 mg/kg/
day) or lower (<0.5 mg/kg/day) initial dose of predniso(lo)ne af￾fected the rate of the normalization of transaminases, and found 
no significant difference between the two groups, even after 
adjusting clinical confounders; they concluded that the dose of 
predniso(lo)ne is less relevant than previously assumed.
To avoid various adverse effects of predniso(lo)ne, budesonide 
has been suggested as an alternative to predniso(lo)ne. 
Budesonide has a 90% first pass hepatic clearance rate and has 
less pronounced adverse effect profiles. In a prospective, double￾blind, randomized trial, treatment with budesonide in combina￾tion with azathioprine for non-cirrhotic AIH patients induced 
biochemical remission more effectively than prednisone with 
azathioprine, and had a significantly lower incidence of steroid￾specific adverse effects.42 However, a case report appearing im￾mediately after this trial, demonstrated that reactivation of AIH 
occurred during budesonide monotherapy and subsided with 
prednisone treatment.43 In a recent retrospective study in Ger￾many, a biochemical response was observed in 70% of patients 
after 12 months of treatment with budesonide monotherapy 
switched from prednisolone, and in 67% of patients after 24 
months. At the last follow-up evaluation (63 months on aver￾age), 25% of patients received prednisolone therapy because of 
an insufficient response to budesonide or its side effects.44
3. Second-line medical treatment
In a questionnaire-based search among experts, mycopheno￾late mofetil (MMF) was the most frequently used a second-line 
treatment for AIH in the real world.45 MMF is an ester prodrug 
of mycophenolic acid and is indicated for immunosuppression 
following organ transplant or lupus nephritis. MMF inhibits 
inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase, leading to the depletion 
of guanine nucleotides and ultimately the inhibition of DNA 
synthesis.46 Although not officially approved for AIH, MMF has 
been shown to be effective and well tolerated in several retro￾spective studies of AIH patients who responded insufficiently, 
or were intolerant, to corticosteroids. For instance, Efe et al.
47
retrospectively collected data from 121 patients who received 
MMF as a second-line therapy, and found a complete response 
rate in 91.9% and 34% in corticosteroid-intolerant and insuf￾ficient responders, respectively. Recent systematic reviews dem￾onstrated the overall efficacy of MMF as second-line therapy 
in AIH, with a low discontinuation rate due to side effects.48,49
Other second-line treatments used by experts include tacrolimus 
and cyclosporine, and sirolimus, infliximab, and rituximab.45
Since B-cells play a significant role in the pathogenesis of 
AIH, B cell depletion is a promising strategy for the manage￾ment of AIH. Ianalumab (VAY736) is a B cell activating factor 
receptor-blocking, monoclonal antibody that works as a B cell￾depleting agent, and a clinical trial for primary Sjögren syn￾drome revealed therapeutic benefits without major side effects.50
Currently, a global, prospective, randomized phase 2/3 trial is 
being conducted for patients with AIH who exhibited an insuf￾ficient response, or were intolerant, to corticosteroids (Clinical￾Trials.gov. NCT03217422).
4. Withdrawal of immunosuppressive agents
It is well known that the long-term administration of 
predniso(lo)ne frequently accompanies a variety of adverse ef￾fects, including osteoporosis, exacerbation of diabetes, cataracts 
and glaucoma, psychosis, cosmetic changes, and malignancy. 
Azathioprine, considered to be less toxic than corticosteroids, 
has a potential to lead to the development of leukopenia and 
thrombocytopenia, and in some cases, malignancy. In this 
regard, cessation of immunosuppressive drugs should be con￾sidered after achieving clinical remission. In line with this, re￾mission of AIH should be strictly defined and maintained for an 
extended period. Remission of AIH is defined biochemically and 
histologically; biochemical remission consists of normalization 
of serum transaminases and IgG, and histological remission in￾volves the disappearance of interface hepatitis, usually achieved 
long after serological remission. Even if both serum transami￾nases and IgG are normalized, residual interface hepatitis is 
often still present, resulting in relapse of AIH after cessation of 
treatment. Therefore, clinical practice guidelines recommend 
that treatment should be continued for at least 3 years, and for 
at least 2 years after complete normalization of serum trans￾aminases and IgG levels.5
 Thereafter, termination of therapy can 
be considered, but close observation with frequent testing of 
liver enzymes is required since relapse frequently occurs after 
withdrawal of immunosuppressive treatment (50% to 90%) and 
is typically observed in the first 12 months after withdrawal. 
When relapse of AIH occurs, treatment regimens correspond to 
initial treatment protocols with predniso(lo)ne and/or azathio￾prine, and are equally effective. However, it kept in mind that 
patients who relapse more than twice have a significantly worse 
outcome than those without relapse.7
 In this regard, life-long 
treatment with maintenance doses of immunosuppressive drugs 

434 Gut and Liver, Vol. 14, No. 4, July 2020
(predniso(lo)ne 5 mg/day and/or azathioprine 50–100 mg/day) 
is an alternative option to avoid disease relapse, with intensive 
care for side effects.
5. Liver transplantation
AIH patients with end-stage liver disease or acute liver fail￾ure who are unable to be saved with current medical treatment 
require liver transplantation (LT). Although data regarding LT 
in patients with AIH are limited, the overall survival rate in AIH 
appears to be excellent in AIH: The 5- and 10-year recipient 
survival rates are 76% to 79% and 67% to 75%, respectively, 
which are better than for most other indications for LT (Table 
2).51-53 On the other hand, recurrence of AIH in the graft after 
LT is common, and it is very challenging to determine the in￾cidence of recurrent AIH, which is reported to be in the range 
of 7% to 42% (Table 2).54-64 The inconsistency among studies 
is likely due to differences in diagnostic criteria, histological 
analysis (protocol or event-driven biopsy), small sample size 
in each study (no study with more than 100 patients enrolled), 
and follow-up time.65,66 The rate of recurrence increases as the 
follow-up time increases after LT.55,61,62 Neither the revised cri￾teria,3
 nor the simplified criteria,4
 are validated for the diagnosis 
of recurrent AIH.
A number of factors are reported to be associated with the re￾currence of AIH, including the severity of pre-transplant AIH54,61
and withdrawal of corticosteroids.59,62 HLA locus mismatching 
was identified as a risk factor for recurrence67 in one study but 
not in others.59-61,64 A recent study from the United Kingdom 
demonstrated that the 5- and 10-year recurrence rates after LT 
were 6% and 11%, respectively, in their cohort consisting of 69 
patients with AIH, in which 87% of patients were under long￾term maintenance treatment with corticosteroids after LT.58 
Compared to the recurrence rate of 27% in their previous report 
in 1999 in patients without long-term corticosteroid therapy,59 
the authors concluded that long-term corticosteroid use in com￾bination with immunosuppressive agents was associated with a 
lower frequency of recurrence. 
In general, progressing to cirrhosis and graft failure requir￾ing re-transplantation is uncommon, even when AIH recurs in 
the graft.65 However, the mechanisms that cause recurrent AIH 
after LT remain unclear. Furthermore, there are also substantial 
differences between adults and pediatric patients with de novo 
AIH, which substantiates the need for more precise diagnostic 
guidelines in this area.68,69 When recurrence occurs in the graft, 
the strength of immunosuppression should be reinforced with 
re-administration or dosing-up of corticosteroids, or the addi￾tion of other immunosuppressive agents.

SPECIAL PRESENTATIONS: ACUTE-ONSET AIH
AIH could develop as an acute form, severe hepatitis, or acute 
liver failure (ALF) (Table 3). The definition of acute-onset AIH 
has not yet been strictly determined, and therefore the preva￾lence of acute-onset AIH varies depending on the definition and 
cohort. The EASL Clinical Practice Guidelines state that approxi￾mately 25% of AIH patients present with an acute-onset;5,70 in a 
Korean cross-sectional study 46.4% of all AIH cases were acute￾onset, defined as the presence of recent-onset symptoms (≤30 
days).10 Another recent Italian cohort demonstrated that 43% 
of AIH patients met the criteria of acute-onset, defined as >10 
×ULN of transaminases and >5 mg/mL of bilirubin.71 On the 
other hand, the frequency of acute hepatitis was almost 11% in 
a Japanese nation-wide, cross-sectional study, when histologi￾cal diagnosis was employed for the diagnosis of acute hepatitis.9 
It is of note that this lower number indicated the frequency of 
histologically determined “genuine” acute hepatitis, but did not 
include acute exacerbation of chronic hepatitis. Acute-onset 
AIH may contain two different clinical entities; acute exacerba￾tion of chronic AIH and genuine acute-onset AIH without any 
chronicity. But liver histology is dynamically changing during 
disease process and it could be extremely challenging to differ￾entiate these two conditions even with an experienced patholo￾gist.
It is important to note that acute-onset AIH frequently lacks 
the typical serological findings of AIH, such as positive autoan￾tibodies or elevated serum IgG. A Japanese case series involving 
86 patients with acute-onset AIH disclosed that 27% patients 
with acute-onset AIH were ANA negative (<1:40), and there 
was no elevation of serum IgG in more than 50% of cases.72
As a result, when encountering AIH patients with elevated 
transaminases but who lack serological diagnostic markers, the 
possibility of AIH is not commonly considered by physicians. 
This can easily lead to a delayed diagnosis and treatment, and 
progression to severe hepatitis or ALF; therefore, a liver biopsy 
is crucial for making a diagnosis of acute-onset AIH. Unlike 
classic and chronic AIH, centrilobular necrosis rather than por￾tal inflammation appears to be characteristic of acute-onset 
AIH.73-75 However, a recent histological study of acute-onset 
AIH demonstrated that this type of AIH could represent the en￾tire spectrum of liver histology from acute hepatitis to chronic 
hepatitis with various activity and levels of fibrosis, and that 
there were no pathognomonic features for acute-onset AIH.76 
According to this study, several histological findings, including 
lobular and perivenular necroinflammatory activity, pigmented 
macrophages, and a cobblestone appearance of hepatocytes, in 
addition to those present in classic AIH may be beneficial for 
pathological diagnosis. 
Regarding the treatment of acute-onset AIH, corticosteroids 
appear to be similarly effective as in classic AIH, without sig￾nificant adverse effects.71,72,75,77,78 The prompt initiation of high￾dose intravenous (i.v.) corticosteroids (1 g methylprednisolone 
for 3 consecutive days followed by i.v. 1 mg/kg/day predniso￾lone or i.v. 1.5 mg/kg/day prednisolone) appears to be safe and 
may prevent progression to liver failure in patients with acute￾severe AIH.79 A recent retrospective study from India suggested 
that use of corticosteroids for acute-on-chronic liver failure 
(ACLF) with AIH as an acute insult was significantly associated 
with a shorter intensive care unit stay and improvement in the 
90-day survival rate, while the incidence of sepsis was compa￾rable to patients that were not treated with corticosteroids.80 The 
revised Asian Pacific Association for the Study of the Liver con￾sensus recommendations for ACLF indicate that “diagnosis of 
ACLF-AIH requires liver biopsy (transjugular route preferred),” 
and “corticosteroid therapy should be considered for a select 
group of patients presenting with ACLF-AIH.”81 LT is a single 
option for very severe cases who cannot be saved with medical 
treatment alone, but the optimal timing of LT is difficult to de￾termine.82
FUTURE PERSPECTIVE
Whereas the long-term outcome of patients with AIH is 
excellent and comparable to those in the general population, 
several unmet needs still remain to be addressed. First, early 
diagnosis of the disease and treatment intervention with immu￾nosuppressive agents should be standardized globally, especially 
in Asia-Pacific regions where viral hepatitis is endemic and 
AIH is believed to be rare. As described, more than 70% of pa￾tients with AIH were diagnosed after progression to cirrhosis in 
South Asia, and 20% to 25% in Korea and the United Kingdom. 
Furthermore, a cross-sectional study in the United Kingdom 
demonstrated that the current treatment regimen is not uniform 
(29 treatment regimens were reported among 1,249 patients in 
secondary care units), and as a result, the remission rates were 
just 59%.83 Therefore, it is crucial to widely disseminate clinical 
practice guidelines for the management of AIH, making it pos￾sible to diagnose the disease at an earlier stage and to properly 
manage with a standardized treatment policy. 
Second, the health-related quality of life (HrQOL), another im￾portant endpoint of treatment, should be carefully considered. 
Several studies indicated that the HrQOL of AIH patients was 
severely impaired and that depression appears to be a dominant 
symptom affecting well-being, despite clinical and biochemical 
features also being present.84-86 In particular, the use of cortico￾steroids are significantly associated with a decreased HrQOL,85,86
and the use of budesonide appears to improve the HrQOL.84
These observations highlight the unmet need for an alternative 
treatment regimen without corticosteroids, not only for improv￾ing the long-term outcome in those who exhibit incomplete 
responses or who are intolerant to corticosteroids, but also for 
patients who demonstrate an excellent response but who also 
require long-term maintenance therapy.
