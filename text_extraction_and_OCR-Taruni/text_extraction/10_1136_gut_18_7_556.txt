SUMMARY Forty-three patients with cirrhosis and ascites, 21 with normal renal function, 10 with a
progressive functional renal failure (FRF), and 12 with a steady FRF, were investigated for the
presence of endotoxaemia by the Limulus lysate test. Endotoxaemia was found in nine patients with
FRF and in none of the 21 with normal renal function (p < 0-01). A positive Limulus test was almost
exclusively associated with a progressive FRF (eight of 10 patients) and all but one of them died.
Renal function improved as endotoxaemia disappeared in the survivor. Endotoxaemia was also
associated with haemorrhage due to acute erosions of the gastric mucosa, being present in six of
the seven patients who had this complication. Intravascular coagulation was not found in any
patient. The Limulus test was positive in the ascitic fluid in 18 of 21 patients tested, although only
two of them had peritonitis. These results suggest that endotoxaemia may play a critical role in the
development of progressive renal failure and haemorrhagic gastritis in cirrhosis, and emphasise the
potential risk of procedures involving reinfusion of ascitic fluid.
Endotoxin, a lipopolysaccharide derived from Gram￾negative microbes, has been shown to have several
systemic effects in experimental models, including
fever (Greisman and Hornick, 1969), hypotension
(Nies et al., 1968), reduction of renal blood flow
(Cavanagh et al., 1970), intravascular coagulation
(McKay, 1973), and acute erosions in the gastro￾intestinal tract (Tamakuma et al., 1971).
In the normal man, endotoxin absorbed from the
gut into the portal venous blood is rapidly phago￾cyted by the Kupffer cells (Ravin et al., 1960). This
mechanism may be impaired, however, in liver
disease, and endotoxin may reach the general
circulation and produce several systemic effects.
This could be important in some manifestations of
Reye's syndrome (Cooperstock et al., 1975) and has
been shown to be related to both renal failure and
haemorrhagic diathesis in fulminant hepatitis
(Wilkinson et al., 1974). The clinical significance of
endotoxaemia in cirrhosis has not been extensively
studied, although there is evidence indicating that
it could occur frequently (Liehr et al., 1975), and its

presence has been reported in patients with cirrhosis
and renal failure (Wilkinson et al., 1975).
Patients with cirrhosis of the liver are prone to
develop severe episodes of gastrointestinal haemorr￾hage due to acute erosions of the gastric mucosa,
and to present a peculiar type of renal failure,
characterised by a reduction of the renal plasma flow
and the glomerular filtration rate (GFR), a low
urinary sodium concentration, a preserved renal
concentrating ability, a normal urine sediment, and a
poor prognosis (Vesin, 1962; Summerskill, 1966).
The absence of substantial evidence of pathological
changes in the kidneys of these patients has led to
this complication being called 'functional renal
failure' of cirrhosis (Vesin, 1962; Lieberman, 1970).
In the present study, these serious complications of
cirrhosis are associated with the presence of endo￾toxaemia, as detected by the Limulus lysate assay
(Levin and Bang, 1968).
Methods
Forty-three patients with cirrhosis and ascites were
investigated. Twenty-one had a normalrenal function,
and the other 22 patients were considered to have
functional renal failure, as defined by an increased
plasma urea concentration, a GFR below 45 ml/min

Functional renalfailure and haemorrhagic gastritis associated with endotoxaemia in cirrhosis
(endogenous creatinine clearance), a urinary sodium
concentration below 10 mOsm/l, and a normal
urine sediment. Among patients with functional
renal failure two different types of evolution were
observed. In 10 patients the renal failure followed a
rapidly progressive course leading to oligoanuria in
a few days (progressive functional renal failure),
while in the remaining 12 patients the degree of
renal impairment remained steady throughout their
stay in hospital, with no trend to progressive
deterioration (steady functional renal failure).
Thirteen of the 43 patients had a gastrointestinal
haemorrhage while in hospital. Emergency endo￾scopy showed the source of bleeding to be a
haemorrhagic gastritis in seven patients, oesophageal
varices in five, and duodenal ulcer in one. Biochemical
data from the patients are shown in Table 1.
Limulus assay was performed on plasma samples
from all the 43 patients and on ascitic fluid of 21.
The amebocyte lysate used in Limulus assay was
provided by Mallinckrodt Inc., St Louis, Missouri
(lot 4DP). Samples were treated according to
Reinhold and Fine (1971). All glassware used was
rendered pyrogen-free as described by Yin et al.
(1972). Amebocyte lysate (01 ml) was added to 0 1
ml of each sample and incubated at 37°C for 24
hours. The samples were examined after one, four,
and 24 hours of incubation, and the test was con￾sidered positive when a definite gelation occurred.
The sensitivity of the lysate preparation used allowed
endotoxin concentrations above 1 ng/ml to be
detected. In all patients cultures of blood, ascites,
and urine were obtained on the day of the endotoxin
assay.
The coagulation studies performed in 17 patients
included platelet count, prothrombin-time, thrombin
time, fibrin degradation products by tanned red
blood-cell haemagglutination-inhibition technique,
factor V and factor VIII antihaemophilic factor
(VIIIAHF) by the one-stage method, and factor
VIII antigen (VIIIAGN) by electroimmunodiffusion
according to the technique of Laurell (1972).
The statistical significance of differences between
means was calculated by Student's I test. The chi￾square test (Yates' correction) was used to assess the
significance of different incidences of a qualitative
variable, unless otherwise specified in the text.
Results
ENDOTOXAEMIA AND FUNCTIONAL RENAL
FAILURE
Nine patients, all from the group of 22 patients with
functional renal failure, had a positive Limulus
assay. This contrasts sharply with the absence of
endotoxaemia among the 21 patients with normal
renal function (p < 0-01). Only three of the nine
patients with a positive Limulus assay had an
infection that could be considered to be the source
of circulating endotoxin: two had spontaneous
peritonitis and one septicaemia, all by Gram￾negative organisms. Endotoxaemia was present in
eight of the 10 patients with progressive functional
renal failure, but in only one of the 12 patients with
steady functional renal failure (p = 0-01, Fisher's
exact test). Patients with progressive renal failure
had a very poor prognosis. The only survivor of this
group was a patient with progressive renal failure
associated with endotoxaemia, in whom renal
function improved as endotoxaemia disappeared
(Figure). No pathological changes were observed in
the microscopic examination of the kidneys in those
patients who died.
ENDOTOXAEMIA AND GASTROINTESTINAL
BLEEDING
Thirteen of the 43 patients had an episode of gastro￾intestinal bleeding. Haemorrhage was more frequent
in patients with endotoxaemia: seven of the nine
patients as compared with six of 34 without endo￾toxaemia (p < 0-01). Endotoxaemia correlated
closely with haemorrhage due to acute erosions of
the gastric mucosae, being present in six of the seven
patients who had this complication as against one
of the six patients who bled from other lesions (p =
0-024, Fisher's exact test). A positive Limulus test

was frequently associated with both progressive
renal failure and haemorrhagic gastritis. This
association occurred in six patients.
COAGULATION STUDIES
Results of coagulation studies in patients with and
without endotoxaemia are shown in Table 2. No
significant differences were found between the two
groups of patients except for a more prolonged
prothrombin time in patients with endotoxaemia
(p < 0-02). No patient showed clinical signs sugges￾ting an active intravascular coagulation. All had a
very high level of factor VIIIAGN.
ENDOTOXIN IN ASCITES
The presence of endotoxin in the ascitic fluid was
investigated in 21 patients. Eighteen gave a positive
result. The simultaneously performed ascitic fluid
culture was positive in only two of these 18 patients,
who also had clinical signs of peritonitis. Endotoxin
was detected both in ascites and peripheral blood in
only seven patients, and, in them, the concentration
of endotoxin in the ascitic fluid was higher than in
the 11 patients without endotoxaemia, as indicated
by an earlier appearance of gelation.
Discussion
Endotoxaemia has been shown to be related to renal
failure, intravascular coagulation, and haemorrhagic
manifestations in fulminant hepatic failure (Wilkin￾son et al., 1974). In the present study a close cor￾15

Functional renalfailure and haemorrhagic gastritis associated with endotoxaemia in cirrhosis
relation between endotoxaemia and the appearance
of progressive renal failure and gastrointestinal
haemorrhage from acute erosions of the gastric
mucosa was reported in patients with cirrhosis of
the liver. However, the nature of the present inves￾tigation did not allow us to draw definite conclusions
about whether this was a causal relationship or
whether they were parallel manifestations of ad￾vanced liver failure. Nevertheless, there was experi￾mental evidence of a cause-and-effect relationship
between the presence of circulating endotoxin,
impairment of renal function, and the development
of gastrointestinal haemorrhage. Cavanagh et al.
(1970) showed that the administration of endotoxin
to the primate provokes a rise in renal vascular
resistance and a reduction of renal blood flow.
Tamakuma et al. (1971) presented evidence that
endotoxaemia may produce acute erosions in the
gastrointestinal tract in rabbits. On the other hand,
the incidence of gastrointestinal bleeding in the
course of septic shock and in systemic infections due
to Gram-negative organisms in man is higher than
in infections by Gram-positive organisms (Altemeier
et al., 1972), and this has been considered to be
an endotoxin-related effect.
Functional renal failure in cirrhosis has been
regarded as a rapidly progressive complication with
a fatal outcome (Summerskill, 1966), and its appear￾ance has been related to other complications of
liver disease, such as haemorrhage or infections,
even though, in some cases, no precipitant factors
could be found (Summerskill, 1966; Conn, 1973).
Recently, Lieberman (1970), Bosch (1973), and
Rodes et al. (1975) have stressed that patients with
cirrhosis and ascites frequently exhibit moderate
degrees of renal failure for long periods. Survival of
patients with this steady type of functional renal
failure is significantly higher than in the classical
progressive form. In a recent series, a 50% mortality
was reached only after 11 months of follow-up
(Rodes et al., 1975).
In this study, endotoxaemia was found in almost
all patients with progressive functional renal failure.
On the contrary, only one of the 12 patients with
steady functional renal failure and none of the 21
patients with normal renal function had detectable
levels of circulating endotoxin. These results suggest
that endotoxaemia may play an important role in
the appearance of progressive renal failure in
cirrhosis with ascites. The failure to detect endo￾toxaemia in the 'steady' group could be due to the
Limulus assay not being sensitive enough to detect
very small quantities of circulating endotoxin,
although it cannot be excluded that in these patients
the renal failure is not related to endotoxaemia. The
relationship between endotoxaemia and progressive
functional renal failure is emphasised by the progress
of the only patient in this series with progressive
renal failure who survived, in whom renal function
improved as endotoxaemia disappeared (Figure). A
spontaneous improvement of functional renal
failure in cirrhosis is observed in a few patients
(Goldstein and Boyle, 1965; Conn, 1973), generally
with an improvement in the underlying liver disease.
In this study, endotoxaemia was also associated
with gastrointestinal bleeding due to haemorrhagic
gastritis. Six of the seven patients with this com￾plication had a positive Limulus test. The patho￾genesis of haemorrhagic gastritis remains obscure,
but it was not apparently related to intravascular
coagulation. In fact, the coagulation studies disclosed
no signs of overt intravascular coagulation in any
patient, whether endotoxaemia was present or not.
The only difference between endotoxin-positive and
negative patients was a moreprolonged prothrombin
time in the former, which in the absence of signs of
increased peripheral consumption should be ascribed
to a worse liver function. All patients had very high
levels of factor VIIIAGN, confirming previous
reports in patients with cirrhosis (Green and Ratnoff,
1974). This has not been adequately explained, and
the results of the present study suggest that this is
not related to an incapacity of the liver to clear
circulating endotoxins.
In the absence of overt infection, as was the case
in two-thirds of our patients with endotoxaemia,
the most likely source of endotoxin is absorption of
that produced by enteric organisms. In normal
conditions (Ravin et al., 1960) endotoxin is absorbed
from the gastrointestinal tract via the portal vein and
completely cleared from the blood by the reticulo￾endothelial cells in the liver (Braude et al., 1955).
Portosystemic shunting in cirrhosis may allow
endotoxin to reach the general circulation. On the
other hand, there is experimental evidence indicating
that, when a venous outflow block is produced in an
intestinal loop, endotoxin rapidly diffuses through
the intestinal wall (Nolan and Ali, 1972). It is
possible that portal hypertension could act in a
similar way, favouring the passage of endotoxin
either into the portal venous radicles or directly into
the peritoneal cavity, thus explaining our finding of
endotoxin in ascites in many patients, even in 11
who did not have detectable endotoxaemia. An
alternative way by which endotoxin may reach the
ascitic fluid could be that some of the endotoxin
present in the portal venous blood subsequently
overflows into ascites.
The finding of endotoxin in ascites may raise
several theoretical objections about the safety of
some procedures currently used in clinical practice,
involving the infusion of ascitic fluid. In fact, some
