Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are nano-sized membrane-limited organelles that are
liberated from their producer cells, traverse the intercellular space, and may interact
with other cells resulting in the uptake of the EV molecular payload by the recipient
cells which may become functionally reprogramed as a result. Previous in vitro studies
showed that EVs purified from normal mouse AML12 hepatocytes (“EVNorm”) attenuate
the pro-fibrogenic activities of activated hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), a principal fibrosis￾producing cell type in the liver. In a 10-day CCl4 injury model, liver fibrogenesis,
expression of hepatic cellular communication network factor 2 [CCN2, also known
as connective tissue growth factor (CTGF)] or alpha smooth muscle actin (αSMA)
was dose-dependently blocked during concurrent administration of EVNorm. Hepatic
inflammation and expression of inflammatory cytokines were also reduced by EVNorm. In
a 5-week CCl4 fibrosis model in mice, interstitial collagen deposition and mRNA and/or
protein for collagen 1a1, αSMA or CCN2 were suppressed following administration of
EVNorm over the last 2 weeks. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) revealed that EVNorm therapy
of mice receiving CCl4 for 5 weeks resulted in significant differences [false discovery
rate (FDR) <0.05] in expression of 233 CCl4-regulated hepatic genes and these
were principally associated with fibrosis, cell cycle, cell division, signal transduction,
extracellular matrix (ECM), heat shock, cytochromes, drug detoxification, adaptive
immunity, and membrane trafficking. Selected gene candidates from these groups were
verified by qRT-PCR as targets of EVNorm in CCl4-injured livers. Additionally, EVNorm
administration resulted in reduced activation of p53, a predicted upstream regulator of
40% of the genes for which expression was altered by EVNorm following CCl4 liver injury.
In vitro, EVs from human HepG2 hepatocytes suppressed fibrogenic gene expression in
activated mouse HSC and reversed the reduced viability or proliferation of HepG2 cells
or AML12 cells exposed to CCl4. Similarly, EVs produced by primary human hepatocytes
(PHH) protected PHH or human LX2 HSC from CCl4-mediated changes in cell number
or gene expression in vitro. These findings show that EVs from human or mouse
hepatocytes regulate toxin-associated gene expression leading to therapeutic outcomes
including suppression of fibrogenesis, hepatocyte damage, and/or inflammation.

Li et al. Hepatocyte Extracellular Vesicles Suppress Fibrosis
INTRODUCTION
A common pathophysiological feature of chronic liver injury
is the excessive production of collagen and extracellular
matrix (ECM) components that become deposited as insoluble
fibrotic scar material, resulting in physical and biochemical
changes which can compromise essential cellular functions.
Hepatic stellate cells (HSC) are the major fibrosis-producing
cell type in the liver and their fibrogenic actions result
from their participation in an orchestrated molecular response
to sustained injury that also involves injured hepatocytes,
activated resident macrophages, sinusoidal endothelial cells,
and infiltrating immune cells. Many studies have documented
that numerous soluble or ECM-associated signaling molecules
comprise a complex regulatory network that drives and fine￾tunes the fibrogenic response via autocrine, paracrine, or
matricellular pathways among these various cell types. HSC
function is also regulated by juxtacrine pathways that are
triggered by direct cell-cell contact. In turn, these studies have
highlighted the potential value of targeting components of
these pathways in the development of new-generation anti￾fibrotics (Ghiassi-Nejad and Friedman, 2008; Cohen-Naftaly and
Friedman, 2011). However, in many cases the optimal targets,
type of therapeutic agent and mode of administration have yet to
be elucidated and there remain few viable options for direct anti￾fibrotic therapy in patients whose liver fibrosis does not resolve
upon treatment of their primary liver disease.
A newly recognized component of cell-cell communication
in the liver is intercellular trafficking of molecules that are
contained within nano-sized extracellular vesicles (EVs) such as
exosomes or microvesicles. Whereas microvesicles are generally
200–1000 nm in diameter and are formed by budding of
the plasma membrane, exosomes are typically 50–200 nm in
diameter and arise by inward budding of multivesicular bodies
which then fuse with the plasma membrane and cause exosomes
to be released from the cell. Despite their distinct pathways
of biogenesis, both exosomes and microvesicles mediate cell￾cell transfer of their respective molecular payloads that can
potentially cause reprograming events in recipient cells. EV cargo
molecules include a broad spectrum of microRNAs, mRNAs
and proteins that originate from their cells of origin and which
are protected from extracellular degradation by the presence of
the outer vesicular membrane which also functions to present
docking proteins and receptors to recipient cells, allowing for
EV uptake either by fusion with the plasma membrane or
by endocytosis (Kowal et al., 2016). A role for liver-derived
exosomes in fibrosis is suggested by an increase in activation or
fibrogenesis in HSC after their exposure to exosomes from lipid￾laden hepatocytes (Povero et al., 2015), sinusoidal endothelial
cells (Wang et al., 2015), or from activated HSC themselves, the
latter of which involved EV-mediated delivery of pro-fibrogenic
cellular communication network factor 2 (CCN2), also known
as connective tissue growth factor (CTGF; Charrier et al., 2014a;
Perbal et al., 2018). However, the molecular composition of
the EV molecular payload and the phenotypic status of the
recipient cells are critical determinants of how EV action is
manifested in the context of liver fibrosis. For example, we have
shown that quiescent HSC produce exosomes that attenuate
pathways of activation or fibrogenesis in activated HSC due
to exosomal transfer into the recipient cells of miR-214 or
miR-199a-5p which directly inhibit transcription of CCN2, thus
suppressing downstream alpha smooth muscle actin (αSMA)
or collagen production and reverting the cells to a more
quiescent phenotype (Chen et al., 2014, 2015, 2016b). Hence
the molecular cargo in exosomes from HSC may be pro- or
anti-fibrogenic depending on the differential activation status
of producer versus recipient cell. Similarly, EVs produced by
fat-laden hepatocytes drive pro-fibrogenic pathways in HSC
(Povero et al., 2015) whereas we recently showed that EVs from
normal hepatocytes bind to HSC in vivo and have suppressive
actions on activated HSC in vitro (Chen et al., 2018a). In
pursuing the latter findings, we now report that EVs from
hepatocytes have anti-fibrotic actions in vivo that are associated
with attenuated HSC activation and fibrogenesis, hepatocyte
recovery, reduced levels of hepatic monocytes and macrophages,
and attenuated expression of inflammatory mediators, ECM
components, detoxifying cytochromes, and regulators of cell
division. These findings reveal that EVs from hepatocytes have
previously unrecognized therapeutic actions in the liver.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
CCl4-Induced Hepatic Fibrogenesis in
Mice
Animal protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee of Nationwide Children’s Hospital
(Columbus, OH, United States). Male Swiss Webster wild type
mice or transgenic (TG) Swiss Webster mice expressing enhanced
green fluorescent protein (EGFP) under the control of the
promoter for CCN2 (TG CCN2-EGFP (Charrier et al., 2014b);
(4–5 weeks old; n = 5 per group) were injected i.p. with carbon
tetrachloride (CCl4; 4 µl in 26 µl corn oil/25 g body weight;
Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, United States) on Days 1, 3,
5, and 8. Control mice received i.p. corn oil (30 µl/25 g) on
the same days. Some mice received i.p. mouse hepatocyte EVs
(prepared as described below; 0–80 µg EV protein per 25 g body
weight) on Days 2, 4, 6, and 9. Mice were sacrificed 2 days
after the last injection and liver lobes were either perfused with
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde
and processed for histological analysis or immediately harvested
for EGFP imaging using a Xenogen IVIS 200 (PerkinElmer,
Waltham, MA, United States) or snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen
for later RNA or protein extraction.
CCl4-Induced Hepatic Fibrosis in Mice
Wild-type male Swiss Webster mice (4–5 weeks old; n = 5 per
group) were injected i.p. with CCl4 (4 µl in 26 µl corn oil/25 g)
or corn oil (30 µl/25 g) three times per week for 5 weeks. On
alternative days to those used for CCl4 or oil administration,
some mice received i.p. EV (0–80 µg/25 g) three times per week
over the last 2 weeks of the experiment. Mice were sacrificed
36 h after the last CCl4 or oil injection, or in non-treated
littermates. Individual liver lobes were harvested and snap-frozen

Li et al. Hepatocyte Extracellular Vesicles Suppress Fibrosis
in liquid nitrogen for subsequent RNA extraction or perfused
using PBS followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich) for
histological analysis of fixed tissue.
Histology
Perfused mouse livers were fixed and embedded in paraffin.
Sections of 5 µm thickness were cut and stained with
H and E. Sections were stained with 0.1% Sirius Red
(Sigma-Aldrich) for detection of collagen or subjected to
immunohistochemistry (IHC) (see below). Positive signals were
quantified by image analysis.
Hepatocyte Cultures
AML12 mouse hepatocytes [American Type Culture Collection
(ATCC), Manassas, VA, United States] were maintained
in vitro in DMEM/F12/10% FBS containing insulin, transferrin,
selenium and dexamethasone (Chen et al., 2015). HepG2 cells
(ATCC) were maintained in DMEM/10% FBS. Primary human
hepatocytes (PHH; IVAL LLC, Columbia, MA, United States)
were cultured in Universal Primary Cell Plating Medium (IVAL)
according to the vendors’ directions.
Hepatic Stellate Cell Cultures
Primary mouse HSC were isolated from male wild-type Swiss
Webster mice (6–8 week) by perfusion and digestion of
livers with pronase/collagenase, followed by buoyant-density
centrifugation (Ghosh and Sil, 2006; Chen et al., 2011, 2016b).
The cells were maintained in Gibco DMEM/F12/10% FBS
medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, United States)
and split every 5 days for use up to passage 4 (P4). Freshly isolated
quiescent HSC contained lipid droplets that we previously
showed to express desmin or Twist1 but not CCN2, αSMA or
collagen 1a1 (Col1a1) whereas cells that autonomously activated
over the first week of culture expressed desmin, CCN2, αSMA or
Col1a1, but not Twist1 (Chen et al., 2011, 2015). LX-2 human
HSC (courtesy of Dr. Scott Friedman, Icahn School of Medicine
at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, United States) were cultured in
DMEM/10% FBS as described (Chen et al., 2011, 2015).
Hepatocyte EV Purification
Prior to collecting EVs from the conditioned medium of mouse
or human hepatocytes, spent medium was removed, and the
cells were rinsed twice with Hanks Balanced Salt Solution prior
to incubation overnight in their respective serum-free medium
which was then replaced with fresh serum-free medium for up
to 48 h. The supernatant obtained from sequential centrifugation
of conditioned medium (300 × g for 15 min, 2,000 × g for
20 min, 10,000 × g for 30 min) underwent ultracentrifugation
(100,000 × g for 70 min at 4◦C) in a T-70i fixed-angle rotor
(Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, United States), the pellet from
which was resuspended in PBS and subjected to the same
ultracentrifugation conditions again. The resulting pellet was
dispersed in PBS and the constituent EVs were characterized as
described below. AML12 cell-derived EVs are hereafter termed
“EVNorm” since they were produced under essentially normal
culture conditions as opposed to other EV studies involving
hepatocyte injury or stress (Povero et al., 2013, 2015; Momen￾Heravi et al., 2015; Hirsova et al., 2016a; Ibrahim et al., 2016;
Verma et al., 2016; Lee et al., 2017).
Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis (NTA)
EVs in PBS (107–108 particles/ml) were subjected to nanoparticle
tracking analysis (NTA) using a Nanosight 300 (Malvern
Instruments, Westborough, MA, United States) that had
been calibrated with 100 nm polystyrene latex microspheres
(Magsphere Inc., Pasadena, CA, United States) diluted in PBS to
a fixed concentration. EV samples were each analyzed twice and
v3.2.16 analytical software (Malvern Instruments) was used to
estimate mean particle concentration and size. Recordings were
performed at room temperature with a camera gain of 15 and a
shutter speed of 4.13 ms. The detection threshold was set to 6.
Transmission Electron Microscopy
EVNorm were fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde for 30 min and pelleted
by ultracentrifugation. They were then placed on 200-mesh
copper grids that had been coated with Formvar/Carbon support
film (Ted Pella, Redding, CA, United States) and glow-discharged
with a PELCO easiGlow discharge cleaning system (Ted Pella).
EVs were negatively stained with 1% aqueous uranyl acetate and
examined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) using a
FEI Tecnai G2 Biotwin instrument (Atlanta, GA, United States)
operating at 80 kV. Digital micrographs were captured using an
AMT camera with FEI imaging software.
EV Cell Binding Assays
Primary human hepatocytes-derived EVs were labeled with the
fluorescent lipophilic membrane dye PKH26 (Sigma-Aldrich)
essentially as previously described (Chen et al., 2018a) and
incubated in a 96-well culture plate at 2 × 109 particles/ml for
24 h with PHHs (on collagen-coated wells) or LX-2 cells that
had been exposed to 20 mM CCl4 for the preceding 24 h. Cells
were stained with DAPI, rinsed in PBS, and EV binding was
assessed using a LSM 800 fluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss
Inc., Thornwood, NY, United States) and quantified using ImageJ
software (NIH, Bethesda, MD, United States).
Effect of Hepatocyte EVs on Hepatocyte
or HSC Function in vitro
HepG2 cells, PHHs, or human LX2 HSC were incubated for
24 h in their respective normal growth media prior to being
placed under fresh serum-free conditions in the presence or
absence of 20 mM CCl4 for 48 h, the last 24 h of which included
incubation with or without EVs from HepG2 cells or PHHs (8–
16 µg/ml or 2–4 × 108 particles/ml, respectively). Cells were
assessed for cell proliferation using a CyQUANTR
assay (Thermo
Fisher Scientific) or for viability using an AlamarBlue assay
(Thermo Fisher Scientific). For gene expression studies, PHHs,
LX2 cells, or mouse P3-4 HSC were placed in fresh serum-free
medium overnight prior to treatment with EVs from HepG2 cells
(8 µg/ml) or PHHs (4 × 108 particles/ml) for 36–48 h in the
presence or absence of 20 mM CCl4 prior to analysis by RT-PCR.

Li et al. Hepatocyte Extracellular Vesicles Suppress Fibrosis
Iodixanol Gradient Ultracentrifugation
PKH26-labeled EVs in 200 µl PBS were loaded on to a 5 ml
stepwise gradient of 8, 16, 24, 32, and 40% iodixanol followed by
ultracentrifugation at 37,500 rpm (SW55 Ti rotor, Beckman) for
17 h at 4◦C. The tube contents were collected from top to bottom
into 20 fractions which were assessed for iodixanol concentration
using an Abbe refractometer (Bausch and Lomb, Rochester, NY,
United States) and PKH26 fluorescence (Ex/Em = 540/585 nm,
cut-off = 570 nm) using a Spectra Max M2 spectrophotometer
(VWR, Atlanta, GA, United States). The fraction containing the
peak PKH26 signal was then assessed for its ability to modulate
gene expression in activated mouse HSC.
Protein Assay
A Pierce bicinchoninic acid assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific)
was used to quantify protein concentrations of EVs in PBS or
of liver tissue proteins that had been extracted using Pierce
radioimmunoprecipitation buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific).
Immunohistochemistry
Mouse liver sections were incubated with primary antibodies
to F4/80 (1:100, Abcam, Cambridge, MA, United States), Ly6c
(1:400, Abcam), collagen 1 (1:250, Abcam), αSMA (1:500;
Thermo Fisher Scientific), or CCN2 [in-house; 5 µg/ml (Charrier
and Brigstock, 2010; Charrier et al., 2014b)] followed by Alexa
Fluor 488 goat-anti rabbit IgG and Alexa Fluor 568 goat-anti
mouse IgG, or Alexa Fluor 647 goat-anti mouse IgG, or Alexa
Fluor 568 goat-anti-chicken IgG (all at 1:500; Thermo Fisher
Scientific) for 1 h at room temperature. The slides were mounted
with Vectashield Mounting Medium containing 40
,6-diamidino￾2-phenylindole nuclear stain (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame,
CA, United States), and examined by confocal microscopy.
Activated HSC were identified by positive immunostaining for
CCN2, αSMA and/or Col1a1.
Mouse Cytokine Microarray
A mouse cytokine proteome profilerTM array (Panel A kit; R &
D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, United States) was incubated with
detergent lysates (320 µg/ml) of pooled liver tissue from acute
CCl4 injury in male Swiss Webster mice (short-term fibrogenesis
model) with or without EVNorm treatment, as described above
(n = 3 or 4 mice per group). Arrays were developed using
chemiluminescence and the mean pixel intensity of duplicate
component spots was quantified using ImageJ (NIH, Bethesda,
MD, United States). Targets showing significant changes in
intensity in response to CCl4 and EVNorm were tested for
their corresponding RNA expression by quantitative real-time
polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR).
Western Blot
Proteins in liver tissue extracts or hepatocyte EVs were subjected
to sodium dodecyl polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS￾PAGE; 10–25 µg protein/lane). Depending on the sample in
question, Western blots were performed to detect proteins
associated with EVs, cytosol, or liver fibrosis. Blots were
incubated with primary antibodies to CD9 (1:500; Abcam),
Alix (1:500; Thermo Fisher Scientific), TSG101 (1:500; Thermo
Fisher Scientific), flotillin-1 (1:200; BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA,
United States), CD63 (1:100; Millipore Sigma, Burlington, MA,
United States), calnexin (1:500; Novus Biologicals, Centennial,
CO, United States), calreticulin (1:500; Novus Biologicals,
United States), p53 (1:1,000; Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA,
United States), phopho-p53 at Ser15 (1:1,000; Cell Signaling)
or β-actin (1:1,000; Invitrogen, Waltham, MA, United States).
Blots were developed using an Odyssey Imaging System (LI-COR
Biosciences, Lincoln, NE) and signals were normalized relative to
β-actin for quantification using ImageJ (NIH).
RNA Sequencing
RNA-seq libraries from mouse livers (long-term fibrosis model
with n = 3 per group for control, oil, oil + EVNorm,
CCl4, or CCl4 + EVNorm) were prepared using the TruSeq
Stranded protocol (Illumina, San Diego, CA, United States).
Following assessment of the quality of total RNA using
an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer and RNA Nano chip (Agilent
Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, United States), 100 ng mouse
liver total RNA was treated with a Ribo-zero Human/Mouse/Rat
Gold kit (Illumina) to deplete the levels of cytoplasmic and
mitochondrial ribosomal RNA (rRNA) using biotinylated, target￾specific oligos combined with rRNA removal beads. Following
rRNA removal, mRNA was fragmented using divalent cations
under elevated temperature and converted into double stranded
cDNA. Incorporation of dUTP in place of dTTP during second
strand synthesis inhibited the amplification of the second strand.
The subsequent addition of a single “A” base allowed for
ligation of unique, dual-indexed adapters with unique molecular
identifiers (UMIs) (Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, IA,
United States). Adaptor-ligated cDNA was amplified by limit￾cycle PCR. Quality of libraries were determined via Agilent 4200
Tapestation using a High Sensitivity D1000 ScreenTape Assay kit
(Agilent Technologies), and quantified by KAPA qPCR (KAPA
Biosystems, Woburn, MA, United States). Approximately 60–
80 million paired-end 150 bp sequence reads were generated
for each library on the Illumina HiSeq 4000 platform. For data
analysis, each sample was aligned to the GRCm38.p3 assembly
of the Mus musculus reference from NCBI using version 2.6.0c
of the RNA-seq aligner STAR (Dobin et al., 2013). Features were
identified from the GFF file that came with the assembly from
Gencode (Release M19). Feature coverage counts were calculated
using featureCounts (Liao et al., 2014). Differentially expressed
features were calculated using DESeq2 (Love et al., 2014) and
significant differential expressions were those with an adjusted
P-value [i.e., false discovery rate (FDR)] of <0.05.
Gene Ontology and Pathway Enrichment
Analyses
Grouping of target genes into molecular functions, biological
processes, or cellular components was achieved by gene ontology
(GO) analysis1 based on the DAVID database2

Li et al. Hepatocyte Extracellular Vesicles Suppress Fibrosis
Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG)3 was used to
understand high-level biological functions and utilities. Genes
were also functionally grouped using Reactome4
. Upstream factor
analysis of the gene lists was carried out using the Ingenuity
Pathway System (Qiagen, Redwood City, CA, United States).
These analyses were each performed with a criterion FDR <0.05.
Protein–Protein Interaction (PPI)
Network Construction
To analyze the physical and/or functional interactions among
the proteins encoded by identified differentially expressed genes
(DEGs), DEGs were uploaded to the online program Search Tool
for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes (STRING)5
, and results
with a minimum interaction score of 0.4 were collated. Clustering
was done using the Markov Cluster Algorithm method with an
inflation parameter of 2.
RNA Extraction and RT-qPCR
Total RNA from liver tissues or cultured hepatocytes was
extracted using a miRNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) and reverse
transcribed using a miScript II RT kit (Qiagen) according to
the manufacturer’s protocols. Transcripts were evaluated by qRT￾PCR using an Eppendorf Mastercycler System and SYBR Green
Master Mix (Eppendorf, Hauppauge, NY, United States). Primers
are shown in Table 1. Each reaction was run in duplicate, and
samples were normalized to GAPDH mRNA or 18S rRNA.
Negative controls were a non-reverse transcriptase reaction and
a non-sample reaction.
Statistical Analysis
Experiments were performed at least twice in duplicate or
triplicate, with data expressed as mean ± SEM. Fluorescence
images were scanned and quantified using ImageJ software
(NIH). Data from qRT-PCR, NTA, and imaging were analyzed
by student’s t-test using Sigma plot 11.0 software (SPSS
Inc., Chicago, IL, United States). Statistics for RNA-seq
analysis are described above. P-values <0.05 were considered
statistically significant.
RESULTS
Characterization of EVs From Mouse
AML12 Hepatocytes
AML12 hepatocyte EVs (“EVNorm”) isolated from 36 to 48-h
conditioned medium under serum-free conditions had a mean
diameter of 110 ± 2.5 nm with a size range of approximately 50–
300 nm as assessed by NTA (Figure 1A). Western blot confirmed
the presence of EV-associated proteins such as CD9, CD63, Alix,
flotillin, and TSG101 (Figure 1B and Supplementary Figure 1)
and we have previously reported that these EVs are also positive
for asialoglycoprotein receptor (Chen et al., 2018a) which is
3https://www.genome.jp/kegg/
4https://reactome.org/
5https://string-db.org/
expressed exclusively in hepatocytes and has been used by others
to characterize or identify hepatocyte-derived EVs (Rega-Kaun
et al., 2019). Moreover, whereas calreticulin or calnexin were
readily detected in AML-12 cell lysates, they were not detected
in EVNorm demonstrating that the EV preparations were not
overtly contaminated with cytoplasmic or cytosolic components
(Figure 1B). A very similar size range to that determined by
NTA was obtained by TEM which also confirmed the vesicular
nature of the purified nanoparticles (Figure 1C). As assessed
by NTA of conditioned medium from AML12 cells that was
removed and replenished at fixed time points during cell culture,
there was a consistent output of EVNorm when the cells were
maintained in serum-free conditions for up to 48 h (Figure 1D).
This demonstrated that the cell culture conditions did not
compromise EVNorm production and hence for the experiments
described below, EVNorm were collected from AML12 cells
that had been maintained in serum-free conditions for up to
48 h in culture.
Therapeutic Effects of EVNorm in vivo
The effects of EVNorm on fibrosing liver injury were analyzed
in mice exposed to CCl4 which is a widely used means of
inducing fibrotic responses in the rodent liver (Constandinou
et al., 2005). First, as assessed by direct Xenogen imaging of
GFP fluorescence in whole liver pieces, the induction of pro￾fibrotic CCN2 in male TG CCN2-EGFP mice that were exposed
to acute CCl4 injury over 8 days was dose-dependently reduced
by administration of EVNorm (Figure 2A). Dose-dependent
suppression by EVNorm on CCl4-induced EGFP, CCN2, or αSMA
levels was also evident by immunohistochemical analysis of
liver tissue sections (Figure 2A). The most effective EVNorm
dose (80 µg/25 g) was next tested for its effect in male
wild-type Swiss Webster mice receiving CCl4 for 5 weeks, a
chronic injury model which elevates serum levels of alanine
aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase (Chen et al.,
2018b). Hepatic fibrosis assessed by Sirius Red staining of
interstitial collagen (Figure 2B) was attenuated to near-baseline

the experiment and this was associated with reduced levels of
CCl4-induced protein levels of αSMA, CCN2, or Col1a1 assessed
by immunostaining (Figure 2C). CCl4 also caused a significant
increase in hepatic Col1a1 mRNA expression that was attenuated
in the presence of EVNorm and a similar but non-significant
trend was also seen for αSMA (Figure 2D). We further found
that inflammatory responses to CCl4 as evidenced by increased
hepatic monocyte (lyc6+) or macrophage (F4/80+) frequency
was suppressed by EVNorm (Figure 3A). Protein microarray
analysis (not shown) indicated that EVNorm dampened the CCl4-
induced levels of tissue inhibitor of metalloprotease-1 (TIMP-1)
and of the pro-inflammatory factors C-C motif chemokine
ligand (CCL)3, CCL5, and CCL12, all except the latter of which
have been previously shown to be associated with inflammation
and fibrosis of the liver (Berres et al., 2010; Heinrichs et al.,
2013; Thiele et al., 2017). Accordingly, the same targets were
analyzed by RT-PCR with the result that expression of their
respective CCl4-induced mRNAs was found to be suppressed
by EVNorm (Figure 3B). A similar trend but one that did not

RNA-Seq Analysis of EVNorm-Mediated
Effects on Gene Expression During CCl4
Liver Injury
Although our primary analysis was focused on the ability
of EVNorm to exert anti-fibrogenic, anti-fibrotic, and anti￾inflammatory activities during liver injury in vivo, we next
performed RNA-seq of liver tissue RNA to investigate potential
broader effects of EVNorm on CCl4-modulated hepatic gene
expression. Significant (FDR < 0.05) up- or down-regulated
expression of 3511 genes occurred in response to CCl4, 233
of which were significantly altered by EVNorm (Supplementary
Table 1 and Figure 4A). The differential expression of these
233 genes is represented in the heatmap shown in Figure 4B
and comprised 191 genes and 42 genes that were, respectively,
induced or suppressed by CCl4. GO (Figure 4C) and Reactome
pathway (Figure 4D) analyses both indicated a significant
enrichment in functions involving cell cycle or cell division,
drug metabolism/detoxification, cell-cell adhesion/ECM, signal
transduction, adaptive immunity, and membrane trafficking.
These enrichments were consistent with the outcome of
STRING analysis which revealed four major interactive clusters
comprising 128 cell cycle/division-related genes, 18 ECM￾related genes, 6 heat shock genes, 7 cytochrome genes, and
8 other detoxifying genes (Supplementary Figure 2). Since
six genes in the ECM-related group (Figure 4E) (Col3a1,
LTBP, MMP2, RELN, Serpinb8, LUM) have been reported to
be involved in fibrogenesis (Preaux et al., 1999; Breitkopf
et al., 2001; Krishnan et al., 2012; Alvarez Rojas et al., 2015;
Carotti et al., 2017; Zhan et al., 2019), we used qRT-PCR to
independently validate the ability of EVNorm to dampen CCl4-
induced expression of each of these transcripts (Figure 4F). All
targets were significantly suppressed by EVNorm (except Serpinb8
which nonetheless trended downward) thus confirming and
extending the anti-fibrogenic properties reported above. qRT￾PCR was also used to confirm the ability of EVNorm to suppress

ability of EVNorm to partially but significantly reverse their
inhibited expression by CCl4. (Figure 4I). Finally, p53 – a
CCl4-indicible tumor suppressor gene that regulates cell cycle,
apoptosis, and genomic stability (Guo et al., 2013; Elgawish
et al., 2015) – was ranked in first position by Ingenuity pathway
analysis as a predicted upstream regulator of 40% of the EVNorm
DEGs (i.e., 91 of 233 genes) in CCl4 liver injury (Supplementary
Figure 3). Consistent with this prediction, Western blot analysis
of liver tissue extracts revealed that the level of CCl4-enhanced
phospho-p53 was attenuated by EVNorm (Figures 4J,K).

than a contaminant, the HepG2 cell-derived EVs were further
enriched using an iodixanol gradient (Figure 5C) after which
their ability to inhibit gene expression in HSC was shown to be
essentially maintained (Figure 5D).
In vivo administration of fluorescently labeled EVNorm in
mice results in their localization to various hepatic target cells
including HSC and hepatocytes (Chen et al., 2018a). Since
we have shown that EVNorm reverses ethanol/TNFα-mediated
suppression of cell proliferation in hepatocytes (Chen et al.,
2018a), we evaluated viability and proliferation of HepG2 cells
that had been exposed in vitro to CCl4 (or DMSO carrier)
in the presence or absence of HepG2 cell-derived EVs. The
reduced viability caused by CCl4 was significantly and dose￾dependently reversed by HepG2 cell-derived EVs (Figure 5E).
Whereas DMSO caused a reduction in HepG2 cell proliferation,
this was exacerbated even further by CCl4 but the deleterious
effects of both agents was dose-dependently reversed by HepG2
cell-derived EVs (Figure 5F). HepG2 cell-derived EVs also
promoted a slight but significant increase in the viability of
HepG2 cells maintained under control non-injurious conditions
(Figure 5E). Similar data were observed for CCl4-treated
AML12 cells exposed to EVNorm or HepG2 cell-derived EVs
(data not shown).

which was present exclusively in PHH lysates (Figure 6B and

with PKH26 and incubated in vitro with PHHs or human LX￾2 HSC in the presence or absence of CCl4. The number of

both basal conditions and after exposure of the cells to CCl4, the

Thus, EVs from human hepatocytes restored alterations in
gene expression associated with injury in human hepatocytes or
fibrogenesis in human or mouse HSC.
DISCUSSION
The emerging field of EV biology has provided a new
impetus for research of liver physiology and pathology, and
virtually every hepatic cell type has now been identified as
an EV producer and/or recipient cell (Lemoinne et al., 2014;
Hirsova et al., 2016b; Cai et al., 2017; Maji et al., 2017;
Szabo and Momen-Heravi, 2017). Unfortunately, as in other
organ systems, there is a dearth of information regarding the
true nature of EV signaling in the liver and between the
various hepatic cell types because few models have yet to be
developed that would allow their various EV populations to
be either tracked from the time of their initial biogenesis in
donor cells to their uptake and action in recipient cells or
functionally compromised in vivo. Despite these limitations,
accumulating evidence supports a role for liver-derived EVs
in regulating hepatic function. For example mouse hepatocyte
exosomes promote hepatocyte proliferation in vitro or after
acute liver injury in vivo caused by ischemia reperfusion
(Nojima et al., 2016). Our previous (Chen et al., 2018a) and
current findings for mouse or human hepatocyte EVs show
that, in vitro, they are anti-fibrogenic for activated HSC, and
reverse ethanol- or CCl4-suppressed proliferation or viability or
alterations in gene expression in hepatocytes. Indeed, the data
presented here show that hepatocyte EVs possess therapeutic
properties that are quite consistent across three hepatocyte
producer cell types (AML12, HepG2, PHH) from two species
of origin of EV producer cell (human, mouse) and across
two target cell types (HSC, hepatocytes) from two species of
origin (human, mouse).
By performing a focused analysis of fibrosis-related molecular
targets and cellular processes in toxic injury in vivo or
in vitro, we showed that in the liver, mouse hepatocyte EVs
are anti-fibrogenic, anti-fibrotic, suppress monocyte/macrophage
infiltration, dampen expression of inflammatory mediators, and
restore toxin-induced changes in hepatocyte function and HSC
activation. The latter two properties were also elaborated by
human hepatocyte EVs in in vitro models suggesting that
the therapeutic properties are evolutionary conserved. It is
currently unclear why, in CCl4-treated mouse liver, EVNorm
appears to target the αSMA protein more efficaciously than its
corresponding mRNA but this may point to the targeting of
αSMA post-transcriptional regulation by the EVNorm molecular
payload. With respect to mRNA targets, RNA-seq analysis
enabled us to undertake a comprehensive analysis of liver genes
that were targeted by EVNorm in mice with CCl4-induced hepatic
fibrosis. In addition to identifying a further slate of pro-fibrogenic
targets, we found that EVNorm action was also associated with the
altered expression of genes associated with ECM, detoxification,
cell cycle/cell division, signal transduction, adaptive immunity,
and membrane trafficking. Thus, the transcriptomic landscape
of genes targeted by EVNorm was diverse, notwithstanding the
fact many were associated with p53, consistent with its level of
activation being a target of EVNorm.
Most previous studies on hepatocyte EVs have addressed
their pathogenic properties when produced by cells that are
stressed, injured, infected, or tumorigenic. For example, (i)
exosomes are used by HCV or HEV as a mean of egress and
transmission from and between hepatocytes (Tamai et al., 2012;
Ramakrishnaiah et al., 2013; Nagashima et al., 2014), (ii) HCV￾infected hepatocytes produce EVs that promote T follicular
regulatory cell expansion (Cobb et al., 2017) and which contain
miR19a which drives HSC activation via the STAT3-TGF-β
pathway (Devhare et al., 2017), (iii) EVs from HBV-infected or
alcohol-treated hepatocytes stimulate macrophage activation and
immune function (Momen-Heravi et al., 2015; Kouwaki et al.,
2016; Verma et al., 2016), (iv) exosomes derived from CCl4-
treated hepatocytes increase toll-like receptor three expression in
HSC, leading to increased IL-17A production by γδ T cells and an
exacerbation of liver fibrosis (Seo et al., 2016), (v) palmitate- or
lysophosphatidylcholine-treated hepatocytes produce ceramide￾enriched EVs (Kakazu et al., 2016), containing C-X-C motif
ligand 10 (Ibrahim et al., 2016), are released from the cell by
mixed lineage kinase 3 (Ibrahim et al., 2016) and have a broad
effect on target cells including stimulation of chemotaxis and
production of inflammatory mediators in macrophages (Hirsova
et al., 2016a; Kakazu et al., 2016), induction of migration and tube
formation in endothelial cells in vitro and angiogenesis in mice
(Povero et al., 2013), and activation of HSC via delivery of miR￾192 or miR-128-3p (Povero et al., 2015; Lee et al., 2017), and (vi)
exosomes from hepatocellular carcinoma cells can either deliver
receptor tyrosine kinases to monocytes which show improved
survival due to activation of mitogen activated protein kinases
(Song et al., 2016) or elicit heat shock protein-specific NK anti￾tumor responses when the donor cells are treated with anti￾cancer drugs (Lv et al., 2012). In contrast, our studies show that
EVs from normal hepatocytes have distinct biological properties
resulting in therapeutic outcomes for liver cell damage and
fibrosis. Future studies will need to provide clarity on how fibrosis
and more severe forms of liver pathology are regulated by the
balance between different populations of EVs from the various
intact and injured hepatic cell types. It will also be interesting
to determine if endogenously released EVNorm, along with EVs
from other hepatic cells, play a more nuanced role by intrinsically
limiting hepatocellular damage and pathogenesis after injury.
Along these lines, the ability of hepatocyte EVs to enhance
hepatocyte function (e.g., HepG2 cell viability, PHH cell number)
even under basal conditions may be attributable to the collection
of EVs from cells under culture conditions that are not absolutely
identical to those used for subsequent biological assays, thereby
manifesting a modest therapeutic benefit.
We have recently shown that serum EVs are anti-fibrogenic
and anti-fibrotic in the same in vitro or in vivo models (Chen
et al., 2018b). Although high fidelity animal models to monitor
hepatocyte EV release and distribution are currently lacking,
emerging evidence suggests that EVs harboring hepatocyte
markers are detectable in the circulation, at least in certain liver
diseases (Povero et al., 2014; Rega-Kaun et al., 2019). Hence

Li et al. Hepatocyte Extracellular Vesicles Suppress Fibrosis
are present in the circulation and thereby contribute to the
pool of therapeutic EVs in serum. We previously identified
miR-34c, -151, -483, or -532 as potential therapeutic cargo
molecules in serum EVs (Chen et al., 2018b) and, while detailed
studies are needed in the future, our preliminary studies have
implicated some of the same miRs in EVNorm (Chen et al.,
2016a). That said, it is likely that additional cargo molecules
in EVNorm contribute to the therapeutic actions of EVNorm on
parenchymal and non-parenchymal liver cells, as well as on the
various infiltrating cell types. Indeed, as recently emphasized
(Gho and Lee, 2017), a reductionist approach to addressing this
question may have a somewhat limited outcome because EVs
are highly heterogeneous at both the single vesicle and systems
level (cargo, EV sub-types etc.). Furthermore, we documented
a broad response in cellular functions and gene expression in
response to EVNorm,
and it is likely that multiple interacting
molecules in the EV molecular payload (miRs, mRNAs, proteins)
are collectively involved, both directly and indirectly. For these
many reasons, a holistic approach (Gho and Lee, 2017) will need
to be undertaken to comprehensively determine the molecular
basis for EVNorm actions. Proteomic analysis of exosomes derived
from rat or mouse hepatocytes previously revealed the presence
of approximately 250 proteins with enrichment for functional
activities including oxidoreductase, GTPase, iron-binding, lipid
binding, intracellular transport, protein folding, stress response,
cellular homeostasis and lipid metabolism (Conde-Vancells et al.,
2008). We speculate that the combinatorial delivery by EVNorm
of a similar repertoire of proteins, together with EV-derived miRs
and mRNAs, underlies the net therapeutic properties of EVNorm.
Finally, many studies have started to emerge showing that
toxic liver injury, inflammation, hepatic fibrosis and HSC
activation are ameliorated by EVs produced by various stem
cells (SC) including umbilical cord mesenchymal SC (Li et al.,
2013; Jiang et al., 2018), adipose-derived mesenchymal SC
(Qu et al., 2017), embryonic SC-derived mesenchymal stromal
cells (Mardpour et al., 2018), amnion-derived mesenchymal SC
(Ohara et al., 2018), pluripotent SC (Povero et al., 2019), bone
marrow mesenchymal SC (Rong et al., 2019), and liver SC (Bruno
et al., 2019). As this research area expands, it will be important
to determine if common mechanisms in these EV populations
account for their shared therapeutic effects in the liver and
the extent to which there is mechanistic overlap with anti￾fibrogenic EVs from differentiated cells such as either hepatocytes
as reported here or quiescent HSC as reported previously (Chen
et al., 2014, 2015, 2016b).
In summary, hepatocyte EVs have anti-fibrotic actions
in vivo that are associated with attenuated HSC activation and
fibrogenesis, hepatocyte recovery, reduced levels of hepatic
monocytes and macrophages, and attenuated expression of
inflammatory mediators, as well as regulation of genes associated
with ECM, detoxification, cell cycle/cell division, signal
transduction, adaptive immunity, and membrane trafficking.
These novel findings show that hepatocyte EVs hold promise
as an innovative therapy for acute or chronic liver injury.
