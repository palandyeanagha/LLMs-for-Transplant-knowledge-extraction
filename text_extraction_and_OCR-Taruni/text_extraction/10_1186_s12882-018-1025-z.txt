Abstract
Background: Long-term outcomes in kidney transplantation (KT) have not significantly improved during the past
twenty years. Despite being a leading cause of graft failure, glomerular disease (GD) recurrence remains poorly
understood, due to heterogeneity in disease pathogenesis and clinical presentation, reliance on histopathology to
confirm disease recurrence, and the low incidence of individual GD subtypes. Large, international cohorts of patients
with GD are urgently needed to better understand the disease pathophysiology, predictors of recurrence, and
response to therapy.
Methods: The Post-TrANsplant GlOmerular Disease (TANGO) study is an observational, multicenter cohort study
initiated in January 2017 that aims to: 1) characterize the natural history of GD after KT, 2) create a biorepository of
saliva, blood, urine, stools and kidney tissue samples, and 3) establish a network of patients and centers to support
novel therapeutic trials. The study includes 15 centers in America and Europe. Enrollment is open to patients with
biopsy-proven GD prior to transplantation, including IgA nephropathy, membranous nephropathy, focal and segmental
glomerulosclerosis, atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome, dense-deposit disease, C3 glomerulopathy, complement- and
IgG-positive membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis or membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis type I-III (old
classification). During phase 1, patient data will be collected in an online database. The biorepository (phase 2) will
involve collection of samples from patients for identification of predictors of recurrence, biomarkers of disease activity
or response to therapy, and novel pathogenic mechanisms. Finally, through phase 3, we will use our multicenter
network of patients and centers to launch interventional studies.

Discussion: Most prior studies of post-transplant GD recurrence are single-center and retrospective, or rely upon
registry data that frequently misclassify the cause of kidney disease. Systematically determining GD recurrence rates
and predictors of clinical outcomes is essential to improving post-transplant outcomes. Furthermore, accurate
molecular phenotyping and biomarker development will allow better understanding of individual GD pathogenesis,
and potentially identify novel drug targets for GD in both native and transplanted kidneys. The TANGO study has the
potential to tackle GD recurrence through a multicenter design and a comprehensive biorepository.

Background
Kidney transplantation is the ideal treatment for most pa￾tients with chronic kidney failure, providing longer sur￾vival and a better quality of life when comparing to
dialysis [1, 2]. Unfortunately, improvements in the
short-term outcomes have not been paralleled by similar
advancements in long-term outcomes [3], with a kidney
graft half-life of only around 10 years [4]. Understanding
the pathophysiology of chronic allograft injury is essential
for providing timely therapeutic interventions and im￾proving allograft survival [5].
Recurrent glomerular disease (GD) after transplant has
been described as the third leading cause of graft loss
[6]. While some forms of primary kidney disease are as￾sociated with higher risk of recurrence and subsequent
early graft loss, others are associated with a delayed
presentation and slowly progressive course [7]. With the
exception of specific mutations for atypical hemolytic
uremic syndrome (aHUS) [8] and focal segmental glo￾merulosclerosis (FSGS) [9], and anti-PLA2R [10] and
anti-thrombospondin type 1 [11] autoantibodies for
membranous nephropathy (MN), no clear genetic, epi￾genetic or environmental risk factors have been identi￾fied to predict the risk of recurrence [12]. Furthermore,
observational studies have failed to demonstrate a clear
association between GD recurrence and immunosup￾pression regimens [13].
In the setting of rare diseases, patient registries repre￾sent precious tools to characterize the natural history of
a condition, to evaluate clinical therapies, to monitor
drug safety and to measure quality of care [14]. Given
the low incidence and the heterogeneity of post-transplant
GD, registries that sample large numbers of patients are
required for the collection of sufficient data to facilitate
clinical outcomes research. Data quality is another essen￾tial ingredient for such registries. The United States Renal
Data System (USRDS), a commonly utilized database for
epidemiologic research of end-stage renal disease patients,
has a large degree of missing data, lacks kidney biopsy
data, and frequently misclassifies patients with a diagnosis
of GD, preventing robust epidemiologic analyses of GD
recurrence [15]. Therefore, ad hoc registries are needed to
define the natural history and response to therapy of GD
recurrence. Other important elements to consider include
the representability of the data, making international
registries including patients with different genetic back￾grounds and heterogeneous treatments the ideal tool. An
international cohort study would also provide the ideal
platform upon which to build a large-scale repository of
biosamples, which in turn could be used to identify and
study biomarkers related to the evolution of the disease
and the response to treatment.
We established The Post-Transplant Glomerular Dis￾ease (TANGO) study, a large international network of
centers to study GD recurrence after renal transplantation
(www.tangoxstudy.com) in January 2017. The TANGO
study is a multi-phase collaborative project involving
retrospective and prospective data collection and biobank￾ing samples to better characterize GD post-transplant.
Herein, we describe the purpose, specific aims and
methodology of the TANGO study, setting the founda￾tion for the creation of a shared international bioreposi￾tory of samples from GD patients and a research
network that will facilitate future clinical trials.
Overarching goals of the TANGO study
1. To define the epidemiology, risk factors, natural
history and response to therapy of GD post￾transplant (Phase 1).
2. To create a large biorepository of human samples
(saliva, blood, peripheral blood mononuclear cells
(PBMC), urine, stool, and kidney tissue samples) for
biomarker validation and discovery (Phase 2).
3. To develop a network of centers to optimize
recruitment and collaboration in clinical trials
(Phase 3).
Specific goals of the TANGO study
1. Phase 1 - Registry:
a. Assess the incidence of GD recurrence after
transplant in different countries
b. Describe natural history of post-transplant GD
recurrence.
c. Identify risk factors for GD recurrence.
Uffing et al. BMC Nephrology (2018) 19:229 Page 2 of 8

d. Analyze the impact of antirejection therapy on
the incidence and severity of GD recurrence.
e. Compare the safety/efficacy profile of different
ad hoc therapies used to treat GD recurrence.
2. Phase 2 - Biorepository
a. Establish a standardized protocol for biobanking
serial samples post-transplant
b. Identify gene variants or mutations associated
with GD recurrence or prognosis.
c. Study gene expression signatures in PBMCs or
in kidney tissue cells that predictGD recurrence.
d. Search for serum/urinary predictors of risk of
recurrence, activity or response to treatment.
e. Investigate the microbiota and its correlation
with disease recurrence.
f. Identify molecular signatures in kidney biopsies
related to disease recurrence.
3. Phase 3 - Network
a. Facilitate the recruitment of carefully phenotyped
cohorts of patients with primary GD, with or
without recurrence in the transplanted graft, for
enrolment in academic or industry-sponsored
multicenter studies examining pathogenic mecha￾nisms, biomarkers, and therapies for the preven￾tion and treatment of GD recurrence.
Methods/Design
The TANGO study was initiated in January 2017 with
the initial number of 15 participating centers in Europe,
North-, and South-America (Fig. 1). The study will be
composed of three phases:
Phase 1 – Data registry
Collection of data from patients with or without recurrent
GD will be executed by medically trained researchers at
each site. A dedicated researcher at the Brigham and
Women’s hospital will oversee the quality and complete￾ness of entered data remotely. Scientific oversight, govern￾ance and data coordination are provided by the principal
investigators (PIs) of the project at each site. Each PI will
also be involved in providing feedback on publication
goals, logistics and drafted manuscripts from the TANGO
Registry. Proposals from participating centers to obtain
access to the full dataset in order to study specific glom￾erular diseases post-transplant will be reviewed by the
steering committee, which will initially consist of Leo￾nardo V Riella, Paolo Cravedi, Audrey Uffing and trans￾plant patient representative.
Phase 1 of the TANGO study protocol was submitted
and approved by the ethical committee of the Partners Hu￾man Research Committee (PHRC) at the Brigham and
Women’s hospital in Boston, and at each participating cen￾ter. In one participating center, the University Medical Cen￾ter Groningen, ethical approval for phase one was waived
by the Medical Ethics review Board (METc UMCG). All
protocols are in accordance with International Conference
on Harmonization Good Clinical Practice Guidelines and
the Declaration of Helsinki. Centers that have an interest of
participating in the TANGO-study can send a request to
contact@tangoxstudy.com.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria
The TANGO study will enroll adult (≥18 years) patients
with a biopsy-proven primary GD as the designated
Fig. 1 Participating centers in the TANGO Study (image adapted from Google Maps, 2017)
Uffing et al. BMC Nephrology (2018) 19:229 Page 3 of 8

cause of their end-stage kidney disease who underwent a
kidney transplant starting from January 2005. The glom￾erular diseases that TANGO Registry includes are listed
in Table 1. Complete inclusion/exclusion criteria are pre￾sented in Table 2. All clinical data regarding disease his￾tory prior to and after kidney transplantation will be
manually extracted from the patient’s medical records.
In a few centers, pre-transplant biopsy may not be
available for a sizable amount of patients. Subjects with
a clinical history strongly suggestive of GD (e.g., sudden
onset of nephrotic syndrome, microhematuria, response
to steroid therapy etc.), will be included in the study due
to the high risk of disease recurrence after transplant.
However, their biological samples will be used only in
case of biopsy proven GD after transplant. Their clinical
data will be collected, but these subjects will not be used
for primary epidemiological analyses.
Variables and follow-up
At enrollment (time of transplant) and every year there￾after the following data will be collected: patient demo￾graphics, renal and other medical past history, kidney
transplantation features, history of rejections and glom￾erular disease occurrence/recurrence post-transplant.
Table 3 summarizes the data that will be entered in the
online database.
Database
The TANGO dataset is made available by REDCap™
(Re￾search Electronic Data Capture), a browser- based,
metadata-driven electronic data capture software solu￾tion, for designing clinical and translational research da￾tabases (https://projectredcap.org). It is widely used in
the academic research community: the REDCap™ Con￾sortium is a collaborative, international network of more
than 2000 institutional partners in over 100 countries,
with more than 400,000 total end-users employing the
software for more than 200,000 ongoing research studies
[16]. Investigators have access to the secure website for
entering and accessing patient data online, which will be
stored at a secure and confidential location. Individual
centers have access to their own recorded data that they
can use for analysis, but will not be able to review other
center’s data. The study main PIs (L Riella, BWH, Bos￾ton and P Cravedi, Mount Sinai, New York) and re￾search coordinators of the project will have access to all
records from all centers, except for patient identifiers,
which are restricted to the specific center to ensure par￾ticipant confidentiality.
Data analysis, expected sample size and statistical
approach
All recorded data will be checked for consistency, errors
and missing data to ensure high-quality data. Data from
different centers will be combined and used for epi￾demiological studies, with the main objective to deter￾mine incidence of recurrent GD and to assess clinical
predictors. We will also analyze response to different
therapies, and evaluate other complications such as re￾jection and infections.
Previous studies showed that recurrence of the glomeru￾lar diseases included in the TANGO-study range from 10
to 90% [17], depending, among other variables, on the dif￾ferent diseases, diagnosis criteria, immunosuppressive

therapies, and geographic location. Sample size for popu￾lation proportion is calculated per disease and is based on
the primary outcome for phase 1: the proportion of recur￾rence of glomerular disease post-transplant. Estimated
sample sizes are shown in Table 4 and are calculated using
the most conservative proportion of recurrence (i.e., clos￾est to 0.5) from previously reported ranges [18, 19], a CI
of 90% and a margin of error of 5%. Consequently, each of
the 15 participating centers has to include 15–18 patients
per disease. For IgA-nephropathy, MN, FSGS and MPGN
this seems a reasonable number to achieve over an inclu￾sion period of 10 years. aHUS, however, has an incidence
of 1–2 cases per million, mainly occurring in childhood
[19]. Hence, in an adult transplantation population, our
study is unlikely to achieve a sample size of 270 for aHUS
and precision of the estimated rate of recurrence will be
reduced.
Data will be analyzed in a de-identified fashion using
Stata software (StataIC-15, StataCorp LLC). For categor￾ical data Fishers Exact test or Pearsons’ chi-square tests
will be used. Continuous data will be plotted and tested
by the Shapiro-Wilk test to confirm normal distribution.
Normally distributed data will be analyzed by t-test. For
non-parametric data, Mann-Whitney U test will be used.
Cox-proportional Hazards will determine hazard ratios
and will be tested using Martingale Residuals. Tests will
be 2-sided and p-values < 0.05 will be considered as sta￾tistically significant.
Phase 2 – Biorepository
A large repository of biological samples will be instru￾mental to better understand GD pathogenesis and to
identify biomarkers of disease recurrence.
Sample collection
Biobanking of samples requires an established infrastruc￾ture at the participating center. Some of the participating
centers already biobank samples and we will link sam￾ples available locally to our global database. At the Brig￾ham and Women’s hospital in Boston, a biobanking
protocol was submitted and approved by the PHRC
(protocol number 2017P000298). Ethical approval of
sample collection at other centers is currently ongoing.
For participating TANGO centers, relevant samples
from saliva, whole blood, serum, urine and stool will be
stored at the time of transplantation and at the time of
GD recurrence. If GD recurs, leftover kidney tissue sam￾ples from biopsies will be stored at that time. For pa￾tients already transplanted with a diagnosis of primary
GD, samples will be obtained post-transplant with or
without recurrence, at yearly intervals and at the time of
each graft biopsy. Funds for the creation of broader
international biorepository will be pursued during 2018
in order to allow the generation of an ad hoc biobank
where saliva, blood, stool and urine samples will be col￾lected before transplant, at 6 months, and every year
thereafter.
Aliquots of urine supernatants, urine-cell pellets and
serum samples, genomic DNA, blood Pax gene tubes for
RNA analysis, and biopsy samples will be stored and
banked in a − 80 °C temperature freezer. PBMC will be
kept in liquid nitrogen.
Sample processing and analysis
Saliva Saliva will be obtained in DNA saliva collection
tubes (Oragene, DNA genotek) and will be used for
DNA-extraction and genotyping, to identify gene vari￾ants or mutations associated with the recurrence or the
prognosis of the GD. DNA-analysis will also be valuable
to categorize patients more accurately in biomarker
studies, where samples from patients with a genetic
cause of GD can be treated as a separate entity.
Whole blood Whole blood will be stored at − 80 °C in
blood RNA tubes, for extraction of RNA. RNA quality
will be assessed using Bioanalyzer and will be used to
build RNAseq libraries and sequenced on a HiSeq 2500.
The results will be used to identify gene expression sig￾natures predictive of GN recurrence.
PBMC PBMC will be isolated from whole blood by
Ficoll separation within 6 h of collection, and frozen
using a standard operating procedure [20]. Cell will be
used for flow cytometry, mass cytometry (CyTOF), and
single-cell RNA sequence analyses.
Serum and urine Aliquots of serum will be frozen at −
80 °C. Urine samples will be centrifuged at 3200 rpm for
5 min at 4 °C within 4 h of collection. The sediment will
be washed and stored at − 80 °C in RNA later for gene
expression studies. Supernatants will be divided into ali￾quots and stored at − 80 °C.
Several proteomic and metabolomic assays can be per￾formed with serum and urine samples, for evaluation of
potential novel biomarkers to pathogenic pathways in re￾current GD or response to pharmacologic intervention.

Besides well-established immunoassays such as ELISA
and Luminex, urine and serum can be analyzed by new
high-output proteomics such as the SOMAscan. The
SOMAscan is a high multiplex, high sensitivity aptamer￾based immune like protein and biomarker discovery
platform, that can simultaneously quantify over 1300
proteins [21]. The high number of proteins being ana￾lyzed provides the opportunity to discover pathways that
involve multiple proteins, and eventually lead to GD.
SOMAscan data is validated by ELISA. In subsequent
analysis, actual pathogenicity of proteins of interest can
be assessed in mice-models [22], kidney-organoid mo
dels [23], or in specific disease models that assess
human-specific glomerular injury [24].
Kidney biopsy tissue For patients who have undergone
a kidney biopsy based on clinical or protocol indication
and have enrolled in this study, excess biopsy material (if
available) will be requested and stored to perform fur￾ther analyses of immune biomarkers and correlate with
findings from biomarkers on blood and urine.
Stool Stool samples will be obtained using stool collec￾tion devices (Ability Building Center, inc) and stored in
RNA later in − 80 degrees Celsius. The importance of
the microbiota has expanded in recent years, including
evidence that it may influence transplant outcomes [25].
With stool samples, we will be able to determine the
composition of the gut microbiota and correlate with
GD recurrence post-transplant. This may be particularly
important for certain GD such as IgA nephropathy in
which this subtype of immunoglobulin is predominantly
secreted on intestinal mucosa as a response to intralum￾inal pathogens. Specifically, we will extract DNA from
stools and perform 16S and 18S rRNA gene sequencing
and total DNA sequencing for shotgun metagenomics.
Since the variety of collected samples require diverse
analysis methods, samples will be analyzed in different
labs that have expertise on the particular assay. For each
individual study, however, samples will be analyzed at
the same institute.
Ideas for collaboration or requests from non-participating
centers to use data and/or samples are appreciated and
will be reviewed by the steering committee. Priority in
usage of data and samples will always be given to par￾ticipating centers.
Phase 3 - clinical trial network
Phase 1 and 2 will provide the specific setting for the de￾velopment of a large dataset of patients eligible for inter￾ventional studies. Currently available and newly identified
biomarkers will enable the identification of patients at
highest risk for recurrence or renal disease progression,
which would help in increasing the statistical power of the
clinical studies. With the data obtained from the prelimin￾ary phases using the samples from the biobank, interven￾tional studies can be designed and conducted with grants
from public institutions, foundations or pharmaceutical
companies.
Discussion
Post-transplant GD recurrence represents the third lead￾ing cause of long-term graft loss [6]. Despite its relevance,
the incidence, the natural history and the risk factors for
GD recurrence remain poorly understood. Several factors
may contribute to this lack of knowledge, including the
heterogeneity of the different diseases and the absence of
large registries that accurately describe the evolution of
patients with GD after transplant. Most registries of GD
recurrence are single center. On the other hand, larger
renal registry data frequently misclassify the cause of kid￾ney disease, confounding estimates of GD recurrence after
transplant [15]. As an example, the reported incidence of
focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) recurrence
after transplant may varies from 10 to more than 50% in
recent studies [26–28]. This probably relates to diverse in￾clusion criteria, population characteristics, underlying dis￾ease mechanisms, management policies (e.g., including
surveillance biopsies or not) and follow-up times across
studies. Similar limitations can be found in terms of prog￾nosis when the registries have not been designed ad hoc
[29–31]. Besides the description of the natural history of
the GD recurrence, the identification of risk factors for
GD recurrence or biomarkers of disease activity would re￾liably inform patient care [13, 32, 33]. To this end, system￾atic and comprehensive data collection from larger
numbers of patients followed-up for longer time would
greatly enhance understanding of disease epidemiology
and potentially improve patient outcomes. In these terms,
the TANGO study is an initiative that aims to respond to
these unmet needs: i.e. a large-scale, systematically col￾lected, multi-center registry of patients with biopsy proven
(gold standard diagnostic test) GD prior to KT. The
TANGO study is a detailed international multicenter
registry designed to describe the natural history of GD
after transplant as well as the identification of potential
risk factors for GD recurrence. To the best of our know￾ledge, this is the first international multicenter cohort
study to examine GD recurrence and evolution after
transplantation. Creation of a large biorepository will also
facilitate mechanistic studies investigating disease patho￾genesis and the identification of noninvasive, reliable im￾mune monitoring assays to predict disease recurrence and
response to treatment. Similarly designed large inter￾national registries have been postulated to collect high
quality data about other rare diseases such as atypical
hemolytic uremic syndrome or glomerular diseases in na￾tive kidneys [34, 35].

Strengths and limitations
The strengths of the study will include: the proposed
large size of the cohort, the requirement for a biopsy
proven diagnosis of GD, the systematic collection of de￾tailed, long-term, clinical data; and the diversity of the
included participants from different geographic regions
and of different racial/ethnic backgrounds. Limitations
include: a lack of surveillance biopsies in some partici￾pating centers, which may limit our capacity to identify
recurrence in the absence of clinical abnormalities, and
the absence of centralized pathology interpretation of bi￾opsies, which will also represent a bias of the present
study. Nonetheless, we expect this study to be instru￾mental in elucidating risk factors, pathogenesis, and
therapeutic targets for post-transplant GD.
