ABSTRACT
Background: The TandemHeart device (THD) is a pump 
system that can be deployed percutaneously (PC) or via con￾ventional surgical (CS) cannulation; it is capable of support￾ing one or both ventricles. It is a versatile system designed for 
use as a rescue device in acute heart failure and as a bridge to 
decision in moribund patients. 
Methods: Retrospective analysis was conducted on all 
patients who underwent a THD implant; either PC or CS; 
at our institution. Univariate analysis was done using Fisher's 
exact and Chi-square tests for categorical variables and Wil￾coxon Rank Sum test for continuous ones. 
Results: 51 adult patients were identified: 10 PC and 41 
CS. Mean age was 58.9 ± 12.8 years, and 31% were female. 
In hospital mortality was 61%. Univariate predictors of death 
were prolonged support (74% versus 46%, P = .04) and higher 
lactic acid levels (5.3 ± 4.9 versus 2.3 ± 1.9 mmol/L, P = .012). 
The length of stay (LOS) for survivors was 59.8 ± 30.0 days. 
Conclusion: Uni- or bi-ventricular unloading can be suc￾cessfully achieved using the THD, either trans-thoracically 
or percutaneously, with an acceptable complication profile. 
INTRODUCTION
Acute severe cardiogenic shock is associated with high 
mortality from multi-system organ failure and sepsis, which 
precludes permanent LVAD placement [Khalife 2007; Gre￾goric 2008, 2009; Kiernan 2010; Thomas 2010]. In these 
patients, short-term extracorporeal pulsatile or nonpulsatile 
ventricular assist devices (VADs) and extracorporeal mem￾brane oxygenation (ECMO) are viable options, particularly 
after intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) and high-dose inotro￾pes have failed to reestablish hemodynamic stability [Entwis￾tle 2003; Khalife 2007; Gregoric 2008, 2009; Kiernan 2010; 
Thomas 2010]. The severe structural remodeling in patients 
with chronic congestive heart failure is a strong predictor of 
the natural course of the disease [Neragi-Miandoab 1999] 
and the severity of such remodeling should be evaluated prior 
to making decisions on a long-term plan. 
Some of these patients will either eventually recover or be 
bridged to a long-term VAD [Bruckner 2008; Busch 2008; 
Gregoric 2009; Neragi-Miandoab 2012]. In addition, a sig￾nificant percentage of patients may develop right ventricular 
(RV) failure in the acute stage following LVAD implantation. 
The THD can be used to bridge patients whose candidacy for 
permanent LVAD placement is not certain and who need tem￾porary support until the work up has been completed. THD 
has been used to support isolated RV failure following LVAD 
implantation and in patients with isolated RV failure follow￾ing an inferior MI [Kiernan 2010; Neragi-Miandoab 2012]. 
Additional indications for THD include: fulminant myocar￾ditis resistant to inotropic agents, failure of IABP to stabilize 
hemodynamics [Khalife 2007] and, in very high risk patients, 
percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) [Vranckx 2009].
Among the implantation techniques for VADs is the closed 
percutaneous technique (PC) [Bara 2007], which requires 
trans-septal cannulation of the left atrium or direct central can￾nulation of the pulmonary vein and aorta as well as right atrium 
and pulmonary artery, as indicated [Pitsis 2007; Bruckner 
2008]. Currently, three percutaneous VADs are available for 
clinical use: the TandemHeart, Centrimag, and Impella system 
[Neragi-Miandoab 2012]. Here we report our institutional 
experience with emergent THD rescue therapy for refractory 
shock with diverse etiologies. Limited data exists on the use of 
this system for acute refractory heart failure syndromes.
METHODS
Retrospective analysis was conducted on all patients at 
our institution with signs of profound cardiogenic shock who 
underwent THD implantation for short-term cardiac assis￾tance between 2007 to 2011. All patients were in severe uni￾or bi-ventricular failure despite maximal medical therapy. We 
looked at factors associated with in-hospital mortality. Uni￾variate and multivariate analysis was done using Fisher's exact 
and Chi-square tests for categorical variables and Wilcoxon 
Rank-Sum test for continuous ones. 
RESULTS
We identified 51 adult patients who had undergone THD 
placement; 10 were performed percutaneously and 41 surgi￾cally. The mean age of patients was 58.9 ± 12.8 years, and 31% 
were female. Indications for support included postcardiotomy 
shock (n = 13, 25.4%), acute MI (n = 19, 37.2%), RV failure 
after LVAD (n = 13, 25.4%), acute heart failure syndrome 
(n = 4, 7.8%) and others (n = 2, 3.9%). Roughly half of the 
patients (n = 24, 47%) had been transferred from other

institutions in acute cardiogenic shock. Additional patient 
characteristics are illustrated in Tables 1 and 2. Postoperative 
complications are shown in Table 3.
With a 100% follow-up, the in-hospital mortality was 
61%; 15 patients (29.4%) survived explantation but died 
prior to discharge. An additional 6 patients (11.7%) died 
while on support. The univariate predictors of death were 
prolonged ventilatory support (74% versus 46%, P = .04) and 
higher lactic acid levels (5.3 ± 4.9 versus 2.3 ± 1.9 mmol/L, 
P = .012). Patients who had percutaneous implantation of 
THD were more likely to have been on IABP (70% versus 
24%, P = .006) or ventilatory support (80% versus 46%, P = 
.056). Patients who died in-hospital were older (61.5 ± 12.4 
versus 54.9 ± 30.0, P = .064) and were more likely to have 
undergone PC implantation of THD (80% mortality for PC 
and 56% for CS). However, these differences weren't statis￾tically significant, which may be attributable to the limited 
statistical power. There was no survival difference between 
patients who were transferred from other institutions com￾pared to in-house patients (P = .42). Mean length of support 
was 9 ± 6 days (range 1-26 days). Of the 20 surviving patients, 
15 (29.4%) recovered and were discharged from the hospital, 
and 5 (9.8%) were bridged to a long-term mechanical assist 
device (with overall survival 39%). The length of stay (LOS) 
for survivors was 59.8 ± 30.0 days. 
DISCUSSION
The superiority of ventricular assist devices to IABP 
in reducing preload and improving the cardiac index and 
end-organ function is well established [Windecker 2007; 
Kar 2011]. THD can provide short-term left and isolated 
right or biventricular support in this setting [Thomas 2010]. 
The percutaneous THD is a left atrial-to-femoral artery 
bypass system [Chandra 2007]. Thomas et al. in 2010 pub￾lished a series of 37 patients with compromised LV function 
(NYHA III-IV) who required THD support prior to complex 
coronary and valvular interventions. The authors reported 
that 71% of their patients survived to hospital discharge. 
Gregoric et al. (2009) used percutaneous THD as a prophy￾lactic approach in patients with critical AS who had under￾gone surgical aortic valve replacement, and had a high wean￾ing rate and favorable survival. The same authors used THD 
in patients with advanced HF and had immediate significant 
improvement on the cardiac index. End-organ function and 
overall condition improved in all patients, thus decreasing 
the preoperative risk factors for implantation of a long-term 
device [Gregoric 2008]. 
Early implantation of THD may allow for rapid off load￾ing of the left ventricle and improve outcomes [Gregoric 
2009]. The majority of patients in the Thomas and Grego￾ric studies had PCI only, and THD played a prophylactically 
supportive role during the procedure. While prophylactic 
placement of THD expands its application, the survival fol￾lowing this approach cannot be compared with other results 
in the literature that used THD as a salvage approach in 
patients with severe cardiogenic shock. The cohort in this 
study included patients with severe acute cardiogenic shock 
who required hemodynamic support on an emergency basis; 
the other patients received THD for RV failure following 
LVAD implantation. 
Using percutaneous THD, Kar et al. (2006) reported a 
survival rate of 61%; 11 patients with cardiogenic shock and 7 
patients who had undergone high-risk PCI. The mean dura￾tion of support following high-risk PCI was 5.5 days. The 
same authors reported using THD in a series of 117 patients 
with acute cardiogenic shock; of these, 80 patients had isch￾emic cardiomyopathy and 37 patients had non-ischemic car￾diomyopathy. After THD implantation, the cardiac index, 
systolic blood pressure, and mixed venous oxygen satura￾tion improved significantly. Urine output, pulmonary capil￾lary wedge pressure, lactic acid levels, and creatinine levels

improved, reflecting recovery of end-organ function. Mor￾tality rates at 30 days and 6 months were 40.2% and 45.3%, 
respectively [Kar 2011]. We believe that the 6 month mor￾tality rates reflect not only high perioperative mortality but 
also comorbidities and underlying conditions. Based on this, 
we recommend using the perioperative mortality rate and the 
survival rate as the only parameters (end points) in evaluating 
the efficacy of THD and short-term VADs. 
Brinkman et al. (2009) reported using THD in 22 patients 
with cardiogenic shock. Indications for insertion included 
bridge to decision (BTD) or salvage and bridge to transplant 
(BTT). Ten of 11 BTT patients were successfully bridged; in 
7 of 11 BTD patients, support was withdrawn. The authors 
recommended using THD as a BTD mode, which allows 
time for a more complete evaluation of neurologic and end￾organ status. Our patient population is similar to the patients 
in the Brinkman study. Of 20 surviving patients in our series, 
15 patients (29.4%) recovered and were discharged from the 
hospital, and 5 (9.8%) were bridged to a long-term mechani￾cal assist device (overall survival 39%); another 15 patients 
(29.4%) survived explantation but died in the hospital. Some 
authors have reported a more favorable outcome and wean￾ing rate with THD [Burkhoff 2006; Pitsis 2007]; however, 
all of our patients had advanced HF and were in severe acute 
cardiogenic shock. Although there is a high weaning rate with 
the use of THD in these settings, the etiology of the disease, 
the patient's condition at the time of THD placement and 
the severity of the cardiogenic shock should all be considered 
when comparing outcomes following THD implantation. 
CONCLUSION
The THD is a versatile system for use as a rescue device 
as a bridge to decision or recovery in patients with acute car￾diogenic shock. Uni- or bi-ventricular off-loading, either 
trans-thoracic or percutaneously, can be achieved with an 
acceptable complication profile. A clinically significant sur￾vival advantage was observed in patients supported via con￾ventional surgical cannulation. This may be due to better flow 
achieved with conventional surgical compared to percutane￾ous implantation. Prolonged ventilatory support and sever￾ity of lactic acidosis both emerged as significant predictors 
of death. An extended LOS can also be expected in surviving 
patients following THD placement.
