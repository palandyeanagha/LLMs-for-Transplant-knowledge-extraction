Sir,
In vivo confocal microscopy of the cornea in Morquio
syndrome
Mucopolysaccharidosis type IVa, known as Morquio
syndrome, is a lysosomal storage disease associated with
corneal haze.1 A deficiency of N-acetyl-galactosamine-6-
sulphate sulphatase leads to keratin sulphate deposition
in the cornea and other tissues. Predominant systemic
features include skeletal abnormalities, hearing loss
and dental caries. We report corneal in vivo confocal
microscopy (IVCM) observations in a case of Morquio
syndrome.
Case report
A 7-year-old male with Morquio syndrome underwent
ophthalmic assessment at the Department of
Ophthalmology, University of Auckland, New Zealand.
The initial diagnosis was made at 9 months of age
following identification of lumbar and lower-thoracic
scoliosis. He subsequently developed hearing loss and
a constellation of musculoskeletal abnormalities.
Unaided visual acuity was 6/7.5 in each eye and
slit-lamp biomiocroscopy revealed a bilateral, diffuse,
fine granular corneal stromal appearance (Figure 1).
The optic discs and maculae were healthy.
Laser scanning IVCM demonstrated morphological
changes throughout the corneal stroma (Figure 2).
Immediately posterior to Bowman’s layer, the stroma
exhibited diffuse, irregular, hyper-reflectivity and in
the anterior and mid-stroma, keratocyte cytoplasm
was clearly visible with a fine, granular appearance.
Keratocyte nuclei were rounded and exhibited
vacuolation, particularly in the posterior stroma. The
Figure 1 Slit-lamp biomicroscopy of the cornea shows a very
mild diffuse fine granular corneal stromal appearance (vision 6/
7.5 both eyes).
Figure 2 Laser scanning in vivo confocal microscopy (IVCM) of the cornea in Morquio syndrome (with normal corneal appearance for
comparision) shows diffuse irregular hyper-reflectivity in the anterior stroma, immediately posterior to Bowman’s layer. The posterior
stroma exhibits rounded, prominent, keratocyte nuclei with vacuolation, and clearly visible keratocyte cytoplasm. (Each IVCM image
frame measures 400 mm  400 mm; image depth: (a) 68 mm, (b) 416 mm, (c) 66 mm, and (d) 398 mm).

corneal epithelium, sub-basal nerves and endothelium
appeared normal.
Comment
This is the first report of IVCM of the cornea in Morquio
syndrome. The granular appearance of keratocyte
cytoplasm corresponds to the intracellular fibrillogranular
inclusions identified by electron microscopy.2
In contrast to cross-sectional analyses of pathological
specimens in light and electron microscopy, the en face
images provided by IVCM offer an alternative
perspective, enabling additional, non invasive analysis of
keratocyte morphology. The appearance of round,
vacuolated keratocyte nuclei, predominantly in the
posterior stroma, has also been reported in Maroteaux–
Lamy3 and Scheie syndromes.4 The hyper-reflectivity
immediately posterior to Bowman’s layer has also
been reported in Scheie syndrome.4
Previous histological reports have also identified
changes in corneal epithelial and endothelial cells.2,5
The ability of IVCM to image corneas at an early stage
of disease may account for the absence of these
abnormalities in this case.
This report confirms that IVCM appearances of the
cornea in Morquio syndrome are similar to those in other
mucopolysaccharidoses.
