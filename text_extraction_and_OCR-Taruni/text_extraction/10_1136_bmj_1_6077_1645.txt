the extremes of incomprehensibility. The Commission is
nevertheless concerned that its arguments should be com￾prehensible and its recommendations unambiguous-aims best
achieved by a clear prose style, unencumbered by jargon and
circumlocution. If it is readable, even to the uninitiated,
this target will have been reached. No work of literature has
ever been written by a committee, and anyone who has ex￾perienced the attempts of a group to compose a flowing para￾graph knows its impossibility. The style of the final report
therefore depends particularly on the secretary, but members
are free to offer amendments or even large-scale rewrites if
they feel so disposed. This is mostly done in correspondence,
and the tactful secretary incorporates these offerings judiciously.
Arresting phrases or a few incisive sentences are often inter￾polated in this way.
The end in sight
Unless there is a determined minority, acrimony recedes by
subsequent meetings, for the end is in sight. Giggles sometimes
break out and the Commission's own family jokes are heard
more often; murmurs of a final party or dinner after the signing
ceremony are heard. As the drafts improve in style, compro￾mises over the sticky parts are reached, and at last a final draft
is agreed. A very senior civil servant reads it and talks to the
Commission about obscurities and difficulties. Then the smooth
machinery of Whitehall takes over. The chairman utters grave
warnings against "leaks," intended or inadvertent. A date
for release has to be considered and press conferences are
arranged. The date must not clash with any expected public
event, for the Commission does not want its press impact to
be diminished. Each member has to state precisely the form
in which his name, style, and titles are to be published. While
members begin to relax, the chairman tenses. A government
reception is given on the day of signing, with cocktail party
courtesy from important figures, longing to know what has
been said but forbidden to ask. On the day before publication
the members each receive a printed copy of the volume, but
without its blue cover to indicate its still unofficial status.
Finally, publication day dawns, with eager perusal of press
response, and then-a slow decline into obscurity.
Occasional Review
The natural history of chronic airflow obstruction
CHARLES FLETCHER, RICHARD PETO
British Medical.Journal, 1977, 1, 1645-1648
Summary
A prospective epidemiological study of the early stages
of the development of chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease was performed on London working men. The
findings showed that forced expiratory volume in one
second (FEV1) falls gradually over a lifetime, but in most
non-smokers and many smokers clinically significant
airflow obstruction never develops. In susceptible people,
however, smoking causes irreversible obstructive changes.
If a susceptible smoker stops smoking he will not recover
his lung function, but the average further rates of loss of
FEV1 will revert to normal. Therefore, severe or fatal
obstructive lung disease could be prevented by screening
smokers' lung function in early middle age if those with
reduced function could be induced to stop smoking.
Infective processes and chronic mucus hypersecretion
do not cause chronic airflow obstruction to progress
more rapidly. There are thus two largely unrelated

disease processes, chronic airflow obstruction and the
hypersecretory disorder (including infective processes).
Introduction
Chronic bronchitis and emphysema are often referred to together
as the "British disease" because they are such a common cause
of death and disability in Britain. Since their cardinal feature
is irreversible obstruction to bronchial airflow, they are often
referred to jointly as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
This term includes chronic obstructive bronchitis and emphy￾sema but excludes asthma or any localised cause of airways
obstruction.'
Although the number of deaths certified as being due to these
conditions has declined in the past 10 years, there were still
some 25 000 in England and Wales in 1974. There were also
about 1000 deaths due to respiratory heart disease plus an
unknown number, perhaps as many as 10 000, certified as being
due either to other forms of heart disease or to pneumonia
where chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was not certified
as the underlying cause of death even though it caused the
fatal condition or aggravated a condition that would not other￾wise have been fatal. The total mortality attributable to chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease is thus about the same as the
total mortality attributed to lung cancer. If it were possible to
identify all deaths that would not have occurred in the absence
of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease it would probably be
found that the proportion misleadingly certified as being due to
other underlying causes is even larger in other countries, includ￾ing the USA, than in Britain.2 Although the certified death
rates in other countries are lower than those in Britain, they

therefore represent only a fraction of the total mortality actually
attributable to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
When airflow obstruction first causes breathlessness that
leads a patient to consult a -doctor, it is usually sufficiently
severe to reduce the forced expiratory volume in one second
(FEVy) to about 1 litre, which is less than half the normal
value. Thereafter the course of the condition usually progresses
relentlessly over five or more years, with further loss of FEV,
causing more and more distressing disability and, finally, death
from respiratory failure. This often occurs in an episode of
bronchial infection complicated by cor pulmonale.
These later phases of the disease have long been well docu￾mented3'5 and it has been found that the severity of airflow
obstruction, usually measured by FEVI, is the main determinant
of prognosis.6-8 Since the damage to the lung appears to be
irreversible at this late stage of the disease, any preventive
action must be taken much earlier. The essential role of smoking
has long been clear,9-'2 but stopping smoking in the terminal
stage is too late,5 and general health education has not had much
effect on the people (male manual workers) who suffer the
greatest risk of this disease.13 Perhaps it could be more effective
if concentrated on potential patients at an earlier stage, but how
could they be identified ?
In the late 1950S14 and again more recently15 it was suggested
that such people could be recognised by their having a produc￾tive cough (simple bronchitis). Pathologists suggested that
mucus hypersecretion encouraged bronchial infection, which
caused obstructive damage to bronchioles and alveolar
tissues.16-"8 The fatal consequences of infections in terminal
patients with terminal obstruction lent plausibility to this latter
view, but it remains an unproved hypothesis.
In 1960 the Medical Research Council's committee on the
aetiology of chronic bronchitis became concerned with the
question of how smoking interacts with other factors in causing
airflow obstruction and commissioned a prospective study of
respiratory symptoms and changes in ventilatory function over
a period of eight years in a large group of working men, few
of whom had any clinical disease. The full results of this study
were recently published1' together with some new statistical
considerations.20 We report here a short summary of the methods
and main results and conclusions of this study, some of which
conflict with current orthodoxy, to stimulate debate in a wider
circle than those who will read a specialist epidemiological
monograph.
Methods
In 1961 a stratified random sample of men (mostly skilled manual
or clerical) aged 30-59 working in West London was taken. Of an
initial sample of 1136 men 792 were seen regularly enough over the
next eight years to provide sufficient data for analysis. The men were
seen every six months, when the following measurements were made.
Mucus hypersecretion was assessed by standard questions about
chronic.phlegm production and by six-monthly measurements of the
volume of phlegm brought up during the first hour after waking on
three separate mornings. These two independent measures enabled
us to rank the men with respect to chronic expectoration more reliably
than has been done in other studies, in nearly all of which single
estimates based on questionnaires have been used.
Bronchial infections were assessed by standard questions about
chest colds or illnesses in the previous six months during which phlegm
production had increased; by recording the purulence of all phlegm
specimens posted to us; and by measuring serum antibodies to
Haemophilus influenzae on one occasion.
Airflow obstruction was estimated by measuring FEV1. After two
practice blows into a spirometer the FEV, readings ofthree subsequent
blows were recorded. The maximum of these three was used, contrary
to MRC recommendations,21 because it was definitely more repro￾ducible than the mean (p 16419). These six-monthly FEVI measure￾ments over eight years allowed us to estimate the average rate of decline
of FEV, for each man during the study. These estimates are called
"FEV, slopes." Unfortunately, FEV, slopes of individuals could
not be measured accurately enough to be useful, but averages of the
FEV, slopes of groups of a dozen or more men were accurate enough
BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL 25 JUNE 1977
for our analysis of causal factors. To ensure that FEV, loss was a valid
measure of development of airflow obstruction 18 men with condi￾tions that could cause restrictive loss of FEV, were excluded.
Results and comment
SMOKING AND LOSS OF FEV1
The following conclusions are summarised in figs 1 and 2.
Firstly, we found that FEV, declines continuously and smoothly over
an individual's life (fig 1). We believe that sudden large irreversible
falls are very rare, for the 9190 measurements that we made of the
changes in FEV, between successive six-monthly surveys were dis￾tributed exactly symmetrically about their mean, with no evidence of
any "tail" due to sudden substantial losses (p 2241"). The rate of loss
seems to accelerate slightly with aging (p 6719).

patterns of FEV, decline (-) with age that are consistent with certain
observations of FEVyL in middle age (0). Smokers who eventually die of
chronic obstructive lung disease have usually already suffered appreciable
FEV, loss in their 40s. Most smokers whose FEVL is already below the nor￾mal range for non-smokers by early middle age are thus at grave risk of later
death from airflow obstruction unless they stop smoking immediately, while
smokers whose FEV, is still above average in middle age will probably not
get serious obstruction. If, however, FEV, at age 25 was originally above
average for other men (of the same age and height) then FEV, may still lie
within the normal range for middle-aged non-smokers even though con￾siderable FEVy loss has occurred. It is therefore impossible to be sure of the
prognosis of a smoker whose FEV, in middle age is just one or two standard
deviations below the average for non-smokers, although many of those
around two standard deviations below average will become disabled over the
coming decades. Other tests may enable those at greatest risk to be detected.

BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL 25 JUNE 1977
Secondly, non-smokers lose FEVI slowly and almost never developed
clinically significant airflow obstruction. None of the 103 non-smokers
in our study had any evidence of even moderate obstruction (p 8319).
Thirdly, many smokers lose FEV, almost as slowly as non-smokers
and never develop clinically severe airflow obstruction. They appear
to be largely resistant to the effects of smoke on their airflow. Smokers
who are more susceptible to these effects develop various degrees of
airflow obstruction, which in some ultimately becomes disabling or
fatal. "Susceptibility" is not an all-or-nothing attribute: rather, it
appears to be a continuum, where the more susceptible a man is the
sooner he will be disabled if he smokes (p 210'9).
Fourthly, stopping smoking will, of course, make little difference
to the FEV, of a non-susceptible smoker whose lungs are not being
much affected by his smoking. But it may make all the difference
to a susceptible smoker. A susceptible smoker who stops smoking will
not recover lost FEVy, but the subsequent rate of loss of FEV, will
revert to normal. This finding is based on a small group of men, but
it has been reported by Comstock et a122 and is strongly supported by
both the low death rate from bronchitis and emphysema among smokers
who have given up more than 10 years earlier (observed in the major
prospective studies of smoking and health9-11) and the minor degrees
of emphysema found by pathologists in dead ex-smokers.23-- It is,
of course, true that severely affected patients derive little benefit from
stopping'; I because the damage already done to their lungs is by then
severe, and merely slowing its further development will not restore
adequate function. The quantitative aspects of these effects of smoking
on FEVI are summarised in the table, where the men aged 50-59
at the start of our study were divided into those who did and those
who did not have mild airflow obstruction, as indicated by a slightly
low FEV, for their age and height. The percentages of men with such
airflow obstruction were: 0°O" of lifelong non-smokers; 28% of ex￾smokers (some of whom had probably stopped because of moderate
disability); 24%o of light smokers (less than 15 cigarettes per day);
46 % of heavy smokers (15 or more cigarettes per day). The means of
the FEV, slopes of non-smokers and of ex-smokers (whether obstruc￾ted or not) were similar. The non-obstructed smokers had slightly
steeper slopes, and the obstructed smokers had much steeper slopes.
Among smokers who have already developed moderate obstruction,
the effect of giving up in early middle age will presumably be to make
their subsequent rate of loss of FEV, approximate to that of the ob￾structed ex-smokers in the table instead of that of the obstructed
smokers. This twofold difference in mean FEVI slope may not seem
very impressive, but, as indicated by the line in fig 1 marked "Stopped
at 45," it can make the difference between a normal lifespan and
premature death. The average effect of stopping is, of course, small
since most smokers are not very susceptible and so have normal lungs
that do not benefit much from stopping smoking. Those who con￾tinue smoking until they are disabled (see, for example, the line
marked "Stopped at 65") will also derive little benefit. The important
finding is that if those who would eventually die from airflow obstruc￾tion stop smoking in early middle age then their subsequent rates of
loss of FEVI will on average be normal, so that most such individuals
will keep well, whereas had they gone on smoking until they became
short of breath it would have been too late.
Measuring FEV, might thus perhaps be used as a screening test
to detect susceptible smokers in middle age, when the fact that the
test showed them that smoking was damaging their lungs might help
to persuade them to stop. (Care would have to be taken not to imply
that smoking is safe for those smokers with normal lung function.)
1647
Peak expiratory flow is even quicker and cheaper to measure and so
could also be used for screening. The disadvantage of both of these
tests for screening (peak flow perhaps even more than FEV,) is their
wide range of normal values. As shown in fig 2, a man whose FEV, is
near the lower end of the normal range for non-smokers may be at
high risk or may be quite free from disease. Such borderline cases
could be referred for more detailed lung function tests which might
help to discriminate between "low normal" and "low abnormal"
FEV1 values. Preliminary results of a study26 of functional tests to
diagnose small airways disease suggest that the best tests for this
purpose would be the airflow rate as forced expiration nears completion
-the Vmax 25-and the expiratory nitrogen slope, both of which
can27 be used as field screening tests.
The real effect of smoking on susceptible smokers may be under￾estimated by looking only at the mean FEV, level in all smokers (or
the mean FEV,/height3 in the total column of the table), as is usually
done in prevalence surveys. There are two reasons for this. Firstly,
smoking has only a small effect on not-very-susceptible smokers, but
they, being in a majority, conceal the more severe effect on the most
susceptible minority. Secondly, we found that smokers with symptoms
tend to cut down their cigarette consumption, so that many of those
who are most susceptible, and thus most severely affected, appear
among the lighter smokers or the ex-smokers.
EFFECT OF MUCUS HYPERSECRETION AND BRONCHIAL INFECTION
Neither mucus hypersecretion nor bronchial infection cause chronic
airflow obstruction to progress more rapidly. This was shown in two
ways. Firstly, we found that after adjusting for FEV, level, smoking,
age, and height there was no independent correlation between FEV,
slope and indices of either mucus hypersecretion (p 9419) or bronchial
infections (p 8719). This suggests that neither can play any causal part
in accelerating the development of chronic airflow obstruction. Since
this was a surprising finding, we sought confirmation by looking at
changes of FEVy level in relation to changes in expectoration and to
episodes of bronchial infection in individual men, and no consistent
or significant effects were found. The loss of FEV, that an individual
man suffered from one six-monthly survey to the next was on average
the same if a chest cold, chest illness, or attack of sputum purulence
intervened as if it did not (p 9119). We are forced to conclude that
neither mucus hypersecretion nor bronchial infections, as we measured
them, play any substantial part in actually causing irreversible airflow
obstruction. Moreover, the chief anatomical site of chronic mucus
hypersecretion (the main bronchi) is different from the (peripheral)
usual chief site of fatal airflow obstruction. We therefore feel that
chronic airflow obstruction and chronic hypersecretion should cease to
be viewed as closely related disease entities (p 14119). Both are caused
by smoking, but they are otherwise largely unrelated conditions,
chronic phlegm production being much less important. The term￾inology that refers to both conditions as one form or another of
"chronic bronchitis" is unfortunately sanctioned by usage, but may
lead to confusion: those terms that unmistakably refer to either the
obstructive or the hypersecretory disorder are preferable. Infective
processes are related strongly only to the hypersecretary disorder. But
can we really dismiss infective processes as early causes of chronic
airflow obstruction? Our negative evidence is very strong, and is
supported by clinical studies,20 29 while positive evidence of any effect

define "mild obstruction." This cut-off point represents very rnild obstruction indeed, for in a man of 1-71 metres aged 60 it would be 2-5 litres, and even a small percentage
of lifelong non-smokers would, in a larger series fall below it.

is virtually non-existent. When challenged to produce evidence to
support his contrary opinion,30 the editor of the British MedicalJ7ournal
could produce no data, just published opinions2' 31-one of them being
that of the MRC committee which organised the present study to
test its opinions. If infections are an important cause of irreversible
airflow obstruction, it should not be difficult to show this, but it has
never been successfully done.* We suggest that those who disagree
with, or want more details of, our present conclusions should consult
the monograph in which our results are more fully set out and dis￾cussed.19 If it is felt that some point would be clarified by a tabulation
or correlation which has not been presented in our monograph, RP
can probably provide this quite easily on request, especially if full
and precise details of just what is wanted are specified.
The future
Our study has emphasised the importance of smoking in
causing airflow obstruction and shown how it might be possible
to detect susceptible smokers in time to prevent disability,
but many problems remain. What is the basis of susceptibility?
It does not seem to lie in overt allergy, for we found no correla￾tion between FEV1 slope and either sputum eosinophilia or a
history of allergic illnesses. Nor does height increase suscepti￾bility, as might be expected from mechanical stresses in the lung,
for we, and Cole,'2 found that percentage losses of FEV1 as men of
different heights get older are similar. Is susceptibility in any
way analogous to %,-antitrypsin deficiency or due to quantitative
differences in leucocyte proteolytic enzymes ? Can it be induced
by infections in childhood that are associated with impaired
lung function?
What causes of obstruction other than smoking are there ?
The British decline in certified death rates from bronchitis
and emphysema over the past three or four decades while
cigarette smoking has increased indicates (unless these changes
are chiefly due to differences in death certification practice for
infective disease) that some important cause or agent must have
been declining in severity. Was this just air pollution? The
large social class gradient of mortality, which was (unless this,
too, was severely biased by nosological artefacts) present long
before there was any social class gradient in smoking, suggests
that there must be causes related to style of living that have not
yet been identified.
Our study has disposed of some misconceptions, and provided
a simpler picture of the natural history of airflow obstruction.
New ideas to be tested by prospective epidemiology will now
be needed to further our understanding of this common, dis￾tressing, and often fatal disorder.
The study whose main findings we have described was financed by
the Medical Research Council and organised by Dr Cecily Tinker. The
analysis, in Sir Richard Doll's department, involved extensive use of
the Science Research Council's Atlas Computing Laboratory. We
are grateful to the unions, management, and men who participated for
eight years, and to many others, particularly Mr I D Hill, Mrs H
Joyce, Ms G Mead, Professor G A Rose, Dr F E Speizer, and Ms M
Stuart.
Requests for reprints should be addressed to Mr R Peto.
*Clinical histories given by patients with severe airflow obstruction often
suggest an onset of the obstruction at the time of a particular chest illness.3
An example is one man in our study who was admitted to Hammersmith
Hospital in cor pulmonale (p 23619). On admission to hospital in 1967, he
reported that he had been quite fit, even rowing with an amateur rowing
club, until 1964, when he had pneumonia, but that after this he had had
chronic disabling shortness of breath. Our study records, however, showed
that his FEV1 had already been only 1 litre in 1961 and that in 1961 he had
said that he could not keep up with other men when walking on the level
because of breathlessness. His FEV1 declined steadily from 1 litre in 1961
to 0-2 litre just before his death in 1970 in respiratory failure. There was thus
no sudden change in FEV1 level after his pneumonia in 1964. Perhaps this
pneumonia increased ventilatory demand on exertion but it did not increase
his airflow obstruction. It is obvious how the history given in 1967 could
mislead a clinician about the effect of this man's pneumonia on the develop￾ment of airflow obstruction.

What might be the cause of pain in the testicles after intercourse ?
I think this man probably has referred pain from the lower lumbar
spine. Lower lumbar disc pain can be referred to the groin or lower
abdomen, including the hemiscrotum of the side in question. Clearly,
we are assuming here that there is no clinical abnormality in the testis,
cord, or hernial orifice, and that there is no abnormality on abdominal
and rectal examination. There may be a history of backache or his
testicular pain may be induced by strenuous exercise of the back under
other circumstances. Treatment should be on the usual lines for a
lumbar disc lesion and in this case his wife should take a more active
role during intercourse until such time as a clinical improvement is
reached.

diastolic reading was 89. Is one justified in giving the lower reading-that
is, with cuff correction-when completing a life insurance report ?
I do not believe that one would be justified in giving only the "cor￾rected" lower reading of the blood pressure after measuring the blood
pressure in a patient with large arm. It would be reasonable to give the
actual blood pressure reading plus the suggested correction for arm
size (clearly indicating that this was an extrapolated number and not
the one that was actually measured).
