Type 1 diabetes is the result of an autoimmune attack against the insulin-producing β cells of the endocrine pancre￾as. Current treatment for patients with type 1 diabetes typically involves a rigorous and invasive regimen of testing 
blood glucose levels many times a day along with subcutaneous injections of recombinant DNA–derived insulin. 
Islet transplantation, even with its substantially improved outcome in recent years, is still not indicated for pediatric 
patients. However, in light of the fact that some regenerative capabilities of the endocrine pancreas have been docu￾mented and recent research has shown that human ES cell lines can be derived in vitro, this review discusses whether 
it is practical or even possible to combine these lines of research to more effectively treat young diabetic patients.
In vertebrates, the process of gastrulation takes place very early dur￾ing the development of the embryo. This process reorganizes the 
embryo’s cells into 3 layers: ectoderm, endoderm, and mesoderm. 
The ectoderm forms the skin and the central nervous system; the 
mesoderm gives rise to the cells from which blood, bone, and muscle 
are derived; and the endoderm forms the respiratory and digestive 
tracts (1, 2). The embryonic endoderm, taking the shape of the prim￾itive gut tube, serves as a template for the gastrointestinal tract from 
which the embryonic pancreas eventually buds. It has been shown 
that the branching morphogenesis of the pancreatic bud gives rise 
to the ducts and the acinar components of the gland. Endocrine 
progenitors, proliferating from the budding ducts, then form aggre￾gates of differentiated cells known as the islets of Langerhans (Fig￾ure 1). While the pancreatic acini, composed of cells dedicated to 
the secretion into the intestine of enzymes that will participate in 
the digestive process of the ingested food, constitute the exocrine 
component of the gland, the islets are made up of 4 cell popula￾tions, organized in a stereotypical topological order, which consti￾tute instead the endocrine component of the gland. In the islet, the 
α cells produce glucagon; the β cells, insulin; the γ cells, pancreatic 
polypeptide; and the δ cells, somatostatin (1, 2) (Figure 1).
It is in large part due to this knowledge of pancreatic embryogenesis 
that residual pancreatic endocrine progenitors, able to guarantee 
islet homeostasis, were originally postulated to be still present in 
the pancreatic ducts of the adult gland. The identification and char￾acterization of these putative progenitors is of paramount impor￾tance, not only for a better understanding of endocrine pancreatic 
physiology and pathology, but also for the development of potential 
therapeutic approaches that their correct exploitation may offer.
Type 1 diabetes is the clinical consequence of the destruction of the 
insulin-producing β cells of the pancreas, mediated by autoreactive 
T cells specifically directed against β cell determinants (3). The loss 
of the majority of the β cell population, evident at the onset of the 
disease, requires daily subcutaneous injections of quantities of insu￾lin that should be proportional to the quantity of glucose present 
in the blood at each moment in time. The physical replacement of 
the β cell mass constitutes the rationale for which islet transplan￾tation was originally proposed by Paul Lacy (4). Although it was 
recently demonstrated that islet cell transplants can be performed 
with greater chances of success than just a few years ago (5), the con￾strains under which this is clinically possible are still too numerous 
to allow the broad application of this procedure to permanently 
cure the disease. The immunosuppressive drug regimen necessary to 
protect islets from a recurrent autoimmune response and allorejec￾tion may, with time, irreversibly damage kidney function, while the 
process of islet isolation itself, even if drastically improved during 
the last few years, damages transplantable islets and, consequently, 
two to three donors are necessary in order to obtain the minimal cell 
mass sufficient for transplantation into a single recipient (6).
In light of recent discoveries showing the regenerative capabili￾ties of the endocrine pancreas and the in vitro derivation of human 
ES cell lines, we have to consider possible, non–mutually exclusive 
alternatives to allogeneic islet transplantation.
Does the elusive pancreatic stem cell exist?
There exists, in humans, a stem cell committed to a specific lineage 
that is capable of giving rise to all types of differentiated cells and 
tissues, including extraembryonic tissues: the totipotent cell. The 
mammalian zygote perhaps should be considered the preeminent 
totipotent stem cell by antonomasia. However, in utero, this stem 
cell continues to divide and becomes an amalgam of similar, but 
not identical, daughter cells. We do not yet know how to distinguish 
among these daughter cells the few that continue to have the capac￾ity to regenerate the whole, multivariate, final product — if these 
totipotent cells still exist at all. Consequently, we do not yet have spe￾cific markers capable of characterizing the totipotent cell. Once the 
various tissues and organs begin to form, we do not know whether 
any totipotent cells are preserved within them and, if they are, how 
long they could continue to be functional. Intuitively, we can argue 
that precursors of some kind are present and active within our body 
throughout life, because even elderly people are able to repair dam￾aged tissues, albeit with reduced efficiency. However, we still do not 
know where these hypothetical precursor cells may be hiding and 
which final differentiated cells they can in fact generate.
Teleologically, our regenerative system should have developed 
according to the same rationale that underlies the stationing 
of firehouses throughout an entire city to allow each unit to be 
able to more rapidly reach the fire location and efficiently inter￾vene. That is, it should have deployed into each organ not nec￾essarily totipotent cells, but at least precursors with self-mainte￾nance capabilities, as well as those necessary to replace worn-out

cells. These precursors should be able to support a process that, 
while progressing relatively slowly in the maintenance of tissue 
homeostasis, could be converted, in case of crisis, into a rapidly 
operating system. Consequently, this system would be highly effec￾tive at responding promptly to a number of stimulations, promot￾ed by nervous signaling, microarchitectural remnants of destroyed 
tissues, metabolites of energy generating processes, peptide growth 
factors, etc. (7–9). Physiologically, in the endocrine pancreas, hor￾mone-producing cells that are at the end of their life span should 
be continuously, albeit quite slowly, replaced by newly generated 
cells. We need to learn more about this regenerative process if we 
wish to take advantage of it for therapeutic purposes.
In considering the utility of stem cells for the regeneration of the 
β pancreatic cell, we currently face some major questions: in the 
adult endocrine pancreas, do multipotent progenitors still exist? 
If so, where exactly are they located? What are the best markers for 
recognizing and isolating them? What are the stimuli able to acti￾vate their differentiation pathway(s)? How large is the time window 
in which they can still respond to the needs of an aging tissue? In 
the absence of pancreatic progenitors, are there adult pluripotent 
stem cells — cells not committed to a specific lineage that may dif￾ferentiate into all types of cells and tissues, with the exception of 
extraembryonic tissues — located elsewhere in the body that may 
have the capability to regenerate β cell mass? If these cells are all 
lineage-committed precursor cells, can we instead use ES cell lines 
derived in vitro to substitute the lost β cells of the pancreas?
The road to regeneration
Increases in β cell mass may occur through increased β cell replica￾tion, increased β cell size, decreased β cell death, and differentia￾tion of possibly existing β cell progenitors (10). It has been shown 
that occasional endocrine cells can be found embedded in normal 
pancreatic ducts. However, these cells are few and far between (11). 
The number of these duct-associated endocrine cells physiologically 
increases as the consequence of severe insulin resistance in obese indi￾viduals or during pregnancy (12, 13). Similar histological changes are 
observed under conditions of tissue injury and repair after partial 
pancreatectomy, duct ligation, cellophane wrapping of the gland, 
or IFN-γ overexpression driven by the insulin promoter (14–17). 
Even then, within the ducts, only a small number of cells become 
insulin positive. This suggests that even if some hypothetical precur￾sors exist, the process of formation of endocrine cells out of the islet 
(neogenesis) would not be a frequently observed property of the duct 
epithelium. On the other hand, the fact that α and β cells develop 
from a possibly common, non–hormone-expressing, yet Pdx1-posi￾tive precursor (Pdx1 being a transcription factor required for pancre￾Figure 1

cells that secrete pancreatic enzymes delivered to the intestine to facilitate the digestion of food. Scattered throughout the exocrine tissue are 
many thousands of clusters of endocrine cells known as islets of Langerhans. Within the islet, α cells produce glucagon; β cells, insulin; δ cells, 
somatostatin; and γ cells, pancreatic polypeptide — all of which are delivered to the blood.

atic development) suggests that all cell types found within the islet 
may originate from a bona fide, common endocrine progenitor (18). 
These endocrine progenitors may be located close to the duct but 
may not actually be components of the ductal epithelium (19). The 
progenitor cells could be mesenchymal in origin, or they could be 
cells differentiated from an unknown cell type. If the number of these 
progenitors is extremely small, lineage analysis becomes very difficult 
because of the lack of known appropriate markers. Moreover, if these 
cells are as rare as they appear to be, it becomes difficult to quantify 
their contribution to normal endocrine cell turnover.
These are some of the conclusions discussed by Weir and Bon￾ner-Weir (20) in commenting on the study by Seaberg et al., in 
which it was shown that single murine adult pancreatic precursor 
cells can generate progeny with characteristics of pancreatic cells, 
including β cells (21). These rare (1 in 3,000–9,000 cells) pancreas￾derived multipotent precursors (PMPs) do not seem to be bona 
fide pluripotent ES cells, since they lack, for example, the Oct4 and 
Nanog markers that direct the propagation of undifferentiated 
ES cells; nor are these cells of clear ectodermal, mesodermal, or 
endodermal origin, since they failed to express other markers con￾sidered specific for precursors of each of the embryonic cell types 
(20, 21). Because, surprisingly, these PMPs also lacked some β cell 
markers (e.g., HNF3β) as well as ductal epithelium markers (e.g., 
cytokeratin), but were able to generate differentiation products 
with neural characteristics along with α, β, δ, and acinar pancre￾atic cells, the authors proposed the existence of a new and unique 
ectodermal/endodermal precursor cell present during embryonic 
development that could persist in adult tissues (21).
These results support the conclusions of another recent study 
in which multipotent pancreatic progenitors were prospectively 
isolated using flow-cytometric cell sorting (22). The marker used 
in this case was c-Met, the HGF receptor. The rationale for this 
choice was the known signal exchange between epithelial and 
mesenchymal cells, promoting the interaction between c-Met and 
HGF, which plays an important role in the development of the pan￾creas. The authors suggest that c-Met–HGF interaction is critically 
responsible for growth and differentiation of pancreatic stem and 
progenitor cells not only during development but also in the adult, 
where they maintain homeostasis and promote regeneration. Colo￾nies derived from single c-Met–positive cells, sorted from neonatal 
and adult mouse pancreatic tissues, contained cells expressing sev￾eral markers for endocrine, acinar, and ductal lineage cells. While 
neuroectodermal markers were not evaluated, the isolated pancre￾atic stem cells in the study by Suzuki et al. (22) were also able to 
generate offspring cells expressing hepatocyte and gastrointestinal 
cell markers, possibly due to the selection marker used. Seaberg’s 
PMP-derived cells were grown instead in the serum-free medium 
conditions normally used for neural stem cell culture (21).
All of these studies, even with their somewhat divergent outcomes, 
seem to support the conclusion that endocrine precursor cells of 
some kind exist in the pancreas. They are present not only in the 
duct, but also within the islets themselves, since both subpopulations 
were independently used as the source of the isolated single cell pre￾cursors (21). On the one hand, this conclusion supports the working 
hypothesis of those who propose that pancreatic ductal cells can 
transdifferentiate into β cells and that this is a physiologic process 
generally more efficiently activated by increased metabolic demand 
and tissue injuries (23); on the other hand, it may also accommo￾date the most recent results of Dor and colleagues (24), who propose 
instead that no β cell can arise from non–β cell progenitors, whether 
in the normal adult pancreas or after pancreatectomy. As a direct 
consequence, the number of β cells should become virtually defined 
at a certain point, and, afterward, glycemia should be controlled 
only by that defined cellular pool. Dor’s results were obtained by 
using a sophisticated Cre/lox system that, in transgenic mice, can be 
induced by tamoxifen. This system labels fully differentiated β cells 
(defined as postnatal cells transcribing the insulin gene) that express 
the human alkaline phosphatase protein, which is in turn revealed 
by a histochemical stain. In a defined period of time, the “chase,” 
only the cells that are progeny of preexisting and labeled β cells 
are newly labeled. New β cells derived from any non–β cell source, 
including stem cells, are not labeled. The frequency and distribution 
of labeled β cells within pancreatic islets, at the end of the chase peri￾od, should be inversely proportional to the number of new, nonla￾beled cells present in the same structures. If the frequency of labeled 
β cells does not change, as was observed, the number of cells derived 
from the differentiation of non–insulin-producing precursors must 
be minimal or null, while terminally differentiated insulin-produc￾ing β cells themselves should be the cells that actually proliferate 
and give rise to other insulin-producing β cells. While the results of 
Seaberg et al. (21) do not contest the proven yet limited ability of a 
β cell to divide, the failure of Dor et al. (24) to observe cells possibly 
differentiated from stem or precursor cells might actually be due to 
both their extremely limited number (21) and technical issues. For 
example, the use of tamoxifen injected intraperitoneally or subcuta￾neously twice a week for two and a half weeks (24) may have blocked 
neogenesis from precursor cells mainly in pancreatic ducts adjacent 
to involuted islets, as observed by Pelengaris et al. (25), and once the 
tamoxifen was withdrawn, these cells may not have had sufficient 
time to differentiate.
Controlling the autoimmune response
On this basis, we can tentatively conclude that precursors of a per￾haps unconventional type can be located both in close proximity 
to and inside the endocrine tissue and that they can be activated 
by increased metabolic demand or by still-unknown secreted 
factors, normally able to accelerate the process that guarantees 
homeostasis of islets of Langerhans under normal conditions. 
The physiologic equilibrium between lost and newly generated 
cells can be altered by the action of β cell–specific, autoreactive 
T cells in instances in which autoimmunity develops (3). Once 
T cell killing activity overcomes the regenerative compensatory 
activity of the organ, the number of functional β cells progres￾sively decreases until they become too few to maintain the gluco￾homeostasis of the entire body. The time of transition over this 
metabolic threshold becomes immediately evident with the pre￾sentation of the characteristic signs of the clinical onset of type 
1 diabetes. During the course of disease, even if the regenerative 
properties of the pancreas remain functional, the continued pres￾ence of diabetogenic, autoreactive T cells consistently nullifies the 
reparative effort. The fact that these autoreactive T cells remain 
present in the body of the diabetic patient for a long time is prov￾en by experiments in which healthy islet cells transplanted into 
syngeneic, long-term diabetic mice or humans were quickly killed 
by these same autoreactive T cells (26).
The autoimmune response is successfully averted in the 
NOD mouse either by directly eliminating the majority of the 
autoreactive T cells with anti–T cell antibodies or by substituting 
all or part of the immunocompetent cell repertoire with bone mar￾row cells obtained from diabetic-resistant donors.

In a study by Ogawa et al., the treatment of overtly diabetic 
NOD mice with anti-lymphocyte serum (ALS) abrogated autoim￾munity but achieved only partial clinical remission (27). Transient 
treatment of overtly diabetic NOD mice with ALS and exendin-4, 
a potent insulinotropic hormone that promotes replication and 
differentiation of β cells in vitro and in vivo, achieved instead 
complete remission of 88% of the treated animals within 75 days, 
accompanied by progressive normalization of glucose tolerance, 
improved islet histology, increased insulin content in the pan￾creas, and almost normal insulin release in response to a glucose 
challenge. These results show that exendin-4 synergistically aug￾ments the remission-inducing effect of ALS, possibly by promot￾ing differentiation of β cell precursors (27).
Also, the successful induction of a mixed allogeneic chimerism 
obtained after transplanting bone marrow from a diabetes-resis￾tant donor into a diabetic animal following a sublethal dose of irra￾diation is sufficient to block and eventually also revert the system￾atic invasion and inflammation of the islets by the autoreactive T 
cells that result in insulitis (Figure 2) (28–30). Within the endocrine 
pancreas, once the insult of autoimmunity is abrogated, the physi￾ologic process of regeneration can continue efficiently, eventually 
replenishing the population of insulin-producing cells to a number 
sufficient to maintain euglycemia, thus curing the diabetic recipi￾ent (Figure 2D) (31–33). While this process takes place — and it 
is still debatable whether this occurs over weeks (32) or months 
(33) — the recipient’s glycemia must be controlled by additional, 
independent measures. The most commonly used technique is to 
transplant into the recipient islets from the same marrow donor. 
However, the successful engraftment of the transplanted bone mar￾row, or the establishment of a steady hematopoietic chimerism, 
would have to be maintained without the use of immunosuppres￾sive agents. These potent drugs may kill not only the still-present 
autoreactive T cells of the recipient, but also the β cells themselves, 
thereby defeating the purpose of the transplant (34–36). The use 
of immunosuppressive agents may also interfere with the observed 
rise of regulatory T cells, a possible explanation for the long-last￾ing immunoregulatory cell–dominant condition observed in cured 
animals. Adoptive transfer experiments in which both diabetogenic 
lymphocytes and splenocytes from ALS-treated, long-term diabe￾tes–free NOD mice were transplanted in NOD/SCID mice with no 
signs of diabetes induction support this hypothesis (27).
A subject of ongoing debate is whether either or both the trans￾planted bone marrow and the cotransplanted β cells are necessary 
for promoting an efficient regenerative process, independent of their 
ability to block autoimmunity or preserve euglycemia, respectively. 
They may, for example, secrete factors such as glucagon-like peptides, 
which are useful in order to sustain an efficient regenerative process 
(27, 37, 38). Strong evidence suggests that the hematopoietic precur￾sors present in the bone marrow cell population do not directly par￾ticipate in the reparative process of the insulin-producing cell popu￾lation (Figure 3) (32, 33). In the cured recipient, insulin-producing 
cells that are genetically marked (by GFP or the Y chromosome of 
the male donor in the female recipient) to indicate they are of donor 
origin are extremely rare, occurring in no more than 2 of more than 
100,000 β cells. These cells may actually be the result of sporadic cell 
fusion processes (39). A different source of donor cells, for example, 
the spleen, might be able to block autoimmunity and also provide 
mesenchymal β cell precursors (40). However, the hypothesized 
presence in the mouse spleen of embryonic mesenchymal cells that

the majority of the transplanted bone marrow cells do not directly partic￾ipate in the regeneration of the endogenous pancreas. As shown here, 
there are no double-positive (orange) cells in the newly formed islets.

Regeneration of the β cell in diabetic NOD mice. (A) In NOD mice, the 
infiltration of autoreactive T cells into the islets of Langerhans (result￾ing in insulitis) begins at around 4 weeks of age. At 20 to 23 weeks, 
approximately 85% of female mice are diabetic, i.e., their glycemia is 
greater than 300 mg/dl. Magnification, ×200. (B) When it is success￾fully transplanted with bone marrow from a non–diabetes-prone donor 
and hematopoietic chimerism is established, the NOD mouse no longer

evidence of insulitis in the endogenous pancreas, there is also no sign 
of insulin production (no red staining). Magnification, ×400. (C) Insulin￾positive cells in the islets can be seen to be dividing (yellow arrows); i.e.,

takes place are removed by nephrectomy, the mice remain nondiabetic.

lack surface expression of CD45 and are able to differentiate into 
endothelial and endodermal cells remains to be confirmed.
Further questions
Even when regeneration of the β cells from precursor cells is defini￾tively proven, issues still to be resolved will include the time frame 
and physiological conditions necessary for regeneration to occur 
and reach completion, as well as the circumstances that facilitate or 
limit the regeneration process and the ability of clinicians to pro￾mote or avoid these, to more efficiently achieve the desired thera￾peutic results. Also, assuming the existence of β cell precursors, we 
still do not know whether these cells are immortal or subject to 
senescence, a situation that would leave a narrow window of time 
for intervention. This matter may be especially relevant in diabetic 
individuals in whom the reparative process has been repressed by 
autoimmune surveillance for a long period of time. If successful 
immunoregulatory intervention cannot be initiated immediately 
after the clinical onset of the disease, a full recovery of the endocrine 
function of the gland via the physiologic regeneration route may 
become impossible. However, if the regenerative process is proven 
to be irreversibly compromised at a certain point, it may still be pos￾sible to transplant into diabetic patients functional precursor cells 
from nondiabetic donors or to artificially convert the patient’s own 
cells from other tissues or lineages into insulin-producing β cells.
The potential for ES cells
Even if specific markers necessary to recognize β cell precursors were 
available, the physical isolation of these cells from a patient’s pan￾creas would not be an easy task. Increasing the number of possible 
precursors ex vivo while avoiding the activation of differentiation 
pathways would also be problematic, as would be eventually facilitat￾ing their differentiation toward the final product, in this case, a func￾tional β cell. Culturing and expanding β cells in vitro has also been 
shown to be difficult and perhaps limited to a few proliferative cycles, 
since they are terminally differentiated cells. It has been postulated 
that it would be easier to derive precursor cells from the embryo and 
use them to regenerate the damaged endocrine pancreas. Although 
human ES cell lines have been successfully derived (41, 42) and 
recently made available to the scientific community (43), the need to 
direct their differentiation toward a specific final product, in this case 
the β cell, still remains a major hurdle that must be overcome.
A stem cell is, by definition, the one cell capable of duplicating 
itself and resuming its undifferentiated status, while also originat￾ing progeny that can differentiate into one or more final products 
that are physiologically defined by their specific functions (44). 
Proceeding through the differentiation pathway, stem cells can be 
categorized as totipotent, pluripotent, multipotent, oligopotent, 
and unipotent, depending upon all their possibly reversible, pro￾gressively acquired characteristics (Figure 4) (44).
ES cells are pluripotent cell lines derived from the inner cell mass of 
blastocyst-stage embryos (41–43, 45), and their differentiation in cul￾ture may reproduce characteristics of early embryonic development. 
Based on similarities between mechanisms that control the devel￾opment of both the adult pancreas and the central nervous system, 
Lumelsky et al. (46) hypothesized that strategies able to induce pro￾duction of neural cells from ES cells could be adapted for endocrine 
pancreatic cell induction. The filament protein nestin is expressed 
by neural ES cells during neural differentiation and also in a subset 
of immature, hormone-negative pancreatic precursors that, upon 
differentiation in vitro, give rise to insulin- and glucagon-expressing 
cells. Lumelsky et al. implemented a working protocol that began 
with the enrichment of the nestin-positive cell population, the 
population of cells derived from embryoid bodies. Embryoid bod￾ies are structures comprising an inner layer of columnar ectoderm 
surrounding a proamniotic-like cavity and an outer layer of primi￾tive endoderm. The nestin-enriched population was then expanded 
in serum-free medium in the presence of FGF. After withdrawal of 
this mitogen from the culture medium to reduce the stimulus for 
cell division, other factors, such as nicotinamide, previously shown 
to be useful in directing the differentiation and/or proliferation 
of precursors found in fetal pancreatic cells (47), were added. The 
result was the production of aggregates of cells expressing insulin.

However, in other hands, similar manipulations have failed to pro￾duce a pancreatic endocrine phenotype in nestin-positive–selected 
cells. Nestin-positive cells seem to contribute to the extra- and intra￾microvasculature of the islet rather than to the hormone-producing 
cells of the pancreas themselves (48, 49). Further criticism of these 
results originated from the evidence that cells in culture may actu￾ally concentrate from the medium the insulin they seem to have pro￾duced (50). Definite answers may be obtained by repeating the same 
experiments using ES cells carrying transgenic fluorescent reporter 
genes controlled by the insulin promoter (51, 52).
The potential of adult stem cells
While the approach discussed above intends to recreate, using specif￾ic feeder cell layers and known growth factors, an environment simi￾lar to that existing in vivo and also to facilitate and guide a desired 
type of cellular differentiation, the approach in another study was 
to isolate in vitro adult pluripotent stem cells from any manageable 
source (e.g., the bone marrow) and physically introduce these cells 
into the already existing, appropriate environment of living recipi￾ents. By receiving spatially and temporally restricted signals from 
the environment, the precursors may differentiate into the cells 
constitutive of that specific target tissue. Lagasse et al. (53) astutely 
took advantage of this approach when they successfully generated 
hepatocytes in vivo from purified HSCs. Using a cocktail of specific 
antibodies able to recognize a combination of distinct cell surface 
markers (c-kithighThylowLin–Sca-1+) on a single cell, the authors 
physically isolated HSCs from bone marrow and transplanted them 
into the fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase–deficient mouse, an animal 
model of fatal hereditary tyrosinemia type I. Liver function in 4 out 
of 9 mutant mice was restored to near normal (transaminase and 
tyrosine levels were slightly increased), when, 3 weeks after trans￾plantation, the standard treatment with 2-(2-nitro-4-trifluoro￾methylbenzyol)-1,3-cyclohexane-dione was discontinued, and these 
mice survived for an additional 6 months without signs of progres￾sive liver failure or renal tubular damage. When the experiment was 
interrupted at 7 months after transplantation, 30–50% of the liver 
mass showed cells expressing donor-derived markers (53). Similarly, 
by transferring precursors into the brain of a recipient mouse, Wei￾mann et al. (54) were able to see purified HSCs differentiate into 
Purkinje neurons. Like HSCs, once transduced with a retrovirus to 
express bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4), muscle-derived cell 
(MDC) precursors were able to dramatically improve the healing of 
a spontaneously irreparable bone fracture (Figure 5) (55).
These data suggest that the signals sent via host-secreted factors or 
by cell-to-cell contacts are powerful enough to guide the transplant￾ed precursors to differentiate into the same type of cells surrounding 
them, even across different lineages. This ability to transdifferentiate 
(i.e., generate a progeny belonging to a tissue lineage different from 
the one of origin) certainly constituted, at the time of publication, 
an astonishing discovery (56, 57). No one had previously even specu￾lated that a mammalian stem cell, present in a mature individual, 
could possess such an impressive plasticity (Figure 6) (44). The pos￾sibility that new β cells could be generated from adult stem cells iso￾lated from tissues belonging to other lineages is particularly appeal￾ing, because it would avoid the potential ethical problems associated 
with the use of ES cells. However, the same authors who originally 
proposed transdifferentiation processes to explain their results soon 
realized that much of the sensational data they interpreted as results 
of an efficient transdifferentiation process were most likely the result 
of cell-to-cell fusion (Figure 6) (58–61). Others have argued that not 
all the results used to support the transdifferentiation capabilities 
of adult stem cells should be dismissed or could be solely explained 
by the cell fusion theory. Ianus et al. (62) deliberately entitled their 
article “In vivo derivation of glucose-competent pancreatic endo￾crine cells from bone marrow without evidence of cell fusion” (ital￾Figure 7

ics added). Regardless, it is perhaps useful to instead consider the 
possibility of actually forcing the fusion of transplanted precursor 
cells with the recipient damaged cells as a means of producing newly 
functional cells, even though the endocrine pancreas appears to be 
an environment difficult to physically reach in vivo.
The potential for gene therapy
Instead of promoting cell-to-cell fusion in an effort to restore certain 
physiologic functions lost with the death of specific cells, it has been 
considered perhaps more efficient to transfect cells belonging to a 
certain lineage with genes able to convert them into cells carrying the 
characteristics of those lost, even if they belong to a completely differ￾ent lineage. In particular, in the field of diabetes research, gut K cells 
of the mouse were induced to produce human insulin by transfecting 
the human insulin gene linked to the 5′-regulatory region of the gene 
encoding glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) (Fig￾ure 7) (63). Also, research demonstrating that hepatocytes transfected 
with the Pdx1 gene under the control of the rat insulin 1 promoter 
were able to produce insulin (64, 65) attracted significant attention 
and has inspired new hope. In these studies, sufficient levels of insu￾lin were secreted to satisfy the needs of a diabetic mouse, which, when 
treated, became and remained steadily euglycemic. These studies, 
however, have not yet been successfully repeated by other groups.
The future problems we face
The ability to clone human embryos and to derive from them 
human ES cell lines is already a reality (41, 43, 45). Even if tomor￾row’s scientists could derive, by cloning, cell lines able to be dif￾ferentiated toward cells with the phenotype of a β cell and in 
sufficient numbers to satisfy the needs of the diabetic transplant 
recipient, in order that they can be used for clinical purposes, these 
cell lines should carry the diploid genome of somatic cell nuclei 
derived from individuals unrelated to the oocyte donor, i.e., those 
of the recipient. Further, we would still need to isolate from each 
patient his or her own stem cell line or develop a bank of cell lines 
representing the broad diversity of human MHC polymorphisms 
in order to avoid allorejection. Under these circumstances, howev￾er, the presence of autoimmunity will remain a concern. If we opt 
to avoid this demanding preparative effort to match donor and 
recipient, it would be necessary to reduce the likelihood of allore￾jection by other means. It may be easier to achieve this goal by using 
ES cells rather than any other adult cell for transplant, since the 
already-studied human ES cell lines appear able to downregulate 
the expression of MHC antigens at their surface (66, 67). It should 
still be noted, however, that rapidly dividing cells with this unique 
phenotype have to spontaneously stop growing once a specific, 
predetermined, total population cell mass has been reached, since 
they appear not to be controlled by NK cells (66). Furthermore, 
even assuming that we could overcome all of these challenges, the 
use of human ES cell lines tailored ad personam would constitute 
an extremely demanding and expensive proposition (68).
Perhaps equally demanding would be the use of means other than 
bone marrow transplant to evade an autoimmune response. Howev￾er, some promising strategies, possibly more suitable for therapeutic 
applications than bone marrow transplant, have already been pro￾posed. Once refined, they may allow the reestablishment of a toler￾ant immune state that would free the patient from the protracted 
attack of T cells against their β cell structures and consequently 
from the requirement for administration of powerful immuno￾suppressive regimens even when transplanted with MHC-matched 
insulin-producing cells. While very efficient in the NOD mouse, the 
use of anti-CD3 monoclonal antibodies able to skew the response 
of diabetogenic, autoreactive T cells from a Th1 to a Th2 program 
(69) seems only able to slow the progression of disease to permanent 
diabetes in humans (70). The possible involvement of CD4+CD25+
T cells in the preservation of tolerance, postulated following results 
obtained in cured mice (71), is also the basis of the treatment pro￾posed by Zheng and collaborators (72), which involves the adminis￾tration of rapamycin, agonistic IL-2–Ig fusion protein, and a mutant, 
antagonist-type IL-15–related cytolytic Ig fusion protein to obtain 
long-term engraftment and tolerance of allogeneic islets transplanted 
into overtly diabetic NOD mice. The CD4+CD25+ T cell population 
is also increased once CD40, CD80, and CD86 cell surface molecules 
are specifically downregulated by ex vivo treatment of NOD mice 
DCs with a mixture of antisense oligonucleotides targeting CD40, 
CD80, and CD86 primary transcripts (73). The incidence of diabetes 
is significantly delayed by a single injection of the engineered NOD 
mouse–derived DCs into syngeneic recipients. Assuming then that 
autoimmunity could be overcome, the potential regeneration-based 
treatment would still require that we determine the length of time 
the β cell regenerative potential could be exploited and the charac￾terization of possible triggering factors that would allow quantitative 
and chronological limits to be bypassed.
Conclusion
Our young diabetic patients must check their blood glucose levels 
and be injected with insulin at least 4 times a day. Concurrently, 
they live with the constant threat of incidents secondary to unpre￾dictable acute hypoglycemic episodes and the ever-present worry 
of chronic complications. Although human ES cell research carries 
with it enormous scientific potential in the treatment and possible 
cure of many diseases, in the near future, the advances in the realm 
of immunoregulation may precede those in the stem cell arena. To 
me, finding safe ways to block autoimmunity seems to be the first 
goal we should achieve in order to give our patients a reliable solu￾tion to their heavy, lifelong burden, since it is a prerequisite for both 
the efficient use of an ES cell–based therapy and the reestablishment 
of euglycemia capitalizing on the pancreatic regenerative pathway.
