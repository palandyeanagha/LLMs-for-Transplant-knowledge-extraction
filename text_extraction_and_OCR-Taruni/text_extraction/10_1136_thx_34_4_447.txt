ABSTRACT Like patients with chronic liver disease, those with coma due to fulminant hepatic
failure may show arterial hypoxaemia even in the absence of pulmonary complications, and in
both it is attributed to increased intrapulmonary arteriovenous admixture. This study is
concerned with the structural alterations in the pulmonary circulation of patients who have died
from fulminant hepatic failure. Precise quantitative morphometric techniques applied to the
injected and inflated lung have shown the major abnormality to be a diffuse dilatation of the
pulmonary vascular bed affecting arteries and veins of all structural types. At an intra-acinar
level the diameter of arteries accompanying respiratory bronchioles was 232-97 ,um (+SD 46 35)
compared with 177-76 /m (±SD 3043) in controls (P<O0O1). In two-thirds of the patients pleural
spider naevi were seen and, throughout the lung, similar significant dilatation of precapillary
vessels; but in only one patient were precapillary anastomoses shown. While intrapulmonary
venous admixture undoubtedly contributes to hypoxia in fulminant hepatic failure, its exact
relation to the structural changes is not yet determined.
The occasional association of cyanosis and finger
clubbing with disease of the liver has been recog￾nised since the turn of the century (Fluckiger,
1884; Gilbert and Fournier, 1895) while the more
frequent occurrence of arterial oxygen desatura￾tion without cyanosis is a more recently established
association (Snell, 1935). These observations have
been concerned with chronic liver disease (CLD)
but desaturation with hypoxia has also been re￾ported in fulminant hepatic failure (FHF). Tyor
and Sieker (1959) in a review of the "biochemical,
blood gas, and peripheral circulatory alterations"
in hepatic coma included three cases of FHF in
which arterial oxygen desaturation was noted.
More recently, with the increase in paracetamol
self-poisoning and the development of liver failure
units, hypoxia has become recognised as a frequent
feature of this syndrome even in the absence of
the clinical or radiological signs of pulmonary
infection or oedema commonly found in severely
ill and debilitated patients (Clark et al, 1973; Ward
et al, 1977).
The mechanism responsible for the arterial
oxygen desaturation in liver disease has been the
subject of much debate, though it is now generally
accepted that arteriovenous admixture is the main
cause of desaturation and cyanosis in patients with
cirrhosis (Bashour and Cochran, 1961) and, as
recently shown, in those with FHF as well (Ward
et al, 1977). Evidence for an intrapulmonary site
for this admixture has been provided by post￾mortem injection studies of the pulmonary arterial
tree, which have shown multiple small pulmonary
arteriovenous fistulae in a few cases (Rydell and
Hoffbauer, 1956; El Gamal et al, 1970). Berthelot
et al (1966) examined the pulmonary circulation in
12 patients with hepatic cirrhosis by injecting the
pulmonary arterial system with a barium/gelatin
suspension. In all cases the fine peripheral branches
of the pulmonary arterial tree were dilated and,
in more than half, pleural spider naevi were seen,
but precapillary anastomoses were found in only
one case. They suggested that the dilated pleural
vessels offer a pathway along which blood is
shunted away from the alveolar respiratory sur￾face directly to the pulmonary veins.
While arteriovenous admixture is well docu￾mented in CLD and a possible pathophysiological
basis has been suggested, in FHF, although hypoxia
is a recognised complication, the presence of

arteriovenous admixture has only recently been
confirmed and the pathological changes in the
lung are unknown. The present study was under￾taken to determine the structural changes in the
pulmonary circulation in FHF, to correlate these
changes with the clinical and physiological find￾ings, and to compare the changes with those oc￾curring in cirrhosis. Applying precise quantitative
morphometric techniques to the injected and in￾flated lung, the size, number, wall structure, and
distribution of the pulmonary arteries and veins
have been established in the lungs of 12 patients
who died of FHF.
Methods
We studied the lungs from 12 patients who died
with hepatic encephalopathy due to FHF. One
lung was obtained from each of eight patients and
both lungs from the remaining four. The clinical
details are summarised (table). Details of the
clinical management have been described else￾where (Ward et al, 1977). The duration of coma
varied from three to 23 days and the length of the
illness preceding this coma from one to 42 days.
The P02 was determined in all but one case, and
in 10 patients the degree of a-v admixture was
assessed by the method of Berggren (1942). Here
the concentration of inspired oxygen was increased
to 100% for 20 minutes using a close-fitting face
mask in those cases not already being ventilated.
Blood was taken into cooled syringes from pul￾monary and systemic arterial lines, the amount of
admixture calculated in the usual way (Berggren,
1942) and expressed as a percentage of cardiac
output. Mixed venous Pco2 was measured directly.
These recordings were made during a stable period

of coma before the onset of terminal compli￾cations. Significant admixture was found in all
cases examined, and ranged from 16 to 29% of
the cardiac output. In a group of normal volun￾teers similar studies showed the mean value of
admixture to be less than 5%.
Representative chest radiographs were exam￾ined. In all, the radiographs were taken within 24
hours of the shunt being measured. Five showed
evidence of mild pulmonary oedema, as judged in
two by loss of vessel definition and in the other
three by the presence of a pulmonary infiltrate;
the remaining seven were normal.
For controls two lungs were obtained from each
of four people (three men aged respectively 26,
40, and 70, and one woman aged 26 years) who
died without liver or lung disease, the cause of
death being in each case a cerebrovascular
accident.
The methods used in the preparation and mor￾phological analysis of the lungs have been des￾cribed in detail elsewhere (Davies and Reid, 1970).
The pulmonary arterial or venous system was in￾jected with a Micropaque/gelatin suspension at
600C and at a pressure of 100 cm of water. The
arterial circulation was injected in all 12 cases of
FHIF and, in addition, the venous circulation in
four. In all four controls both systems were in￾jected. Since this injection technique distends and
fills all vessels greater than 15 ,tm in diameter but
does not cross the capillary bed, reflux from the
pulmonary veins after arterial injection is evidence
of the presence of precapillary arteriovenous an￾astomoses. The lungs were inflated through the
trachea with 10% formol saline at a pressure of
45 cm of water until the pleura was tense. The
pleural surface was examined for the presence of
injection material in blood vessels.
Ten blocks of tissue were then taken from each
lung using a stratified random sampling technique
(Dunnill, 1962). These were routinely processed,
embedded in paraffin, and standard 4 ,tm sections
were cut and stained with Verhoeff's elastic van
Gieson. On these the following quantitative micro￾scopic analysis was made.
Size of arteries with airways-Peripheral arteries
can be landmarked by identifying microscopically
the accompanying airway, that is, terminal or
respiratory bronchiole, alveolar duct, or alveolar
sac. Corresponding vessels can therefore be identi￾fied in different cases and compared. Measure￾ments were made of the external diameter of
arteries accompanying respiratory bronchioles (20-
50 arteries/case) and alveolar ducts (about 50
arteries/case) using a calibrated eyepiece graticule.

Structural alterations to the pulmonary circulation in fulminant hepatic failure
Since veins do not accompany airways but run at
the periphery of the lobule, it is not possible to
landmark them in this way.
Medial wall thickness-Vessel wall thickness
was measured from internal to external elastic
lamina and related to external diameter. In the
normal lung the percentage medial wall thick￾ness (2Xwall thicknessX 100/external diameter)
is related to external diameter, being greater
in the smallest vessels and decreasing with
increasing diameter until, in arteries and veins of
more than 300 ,um in diameter, it remains fairly
constant.
Population counts-Arteries or veins below
250 ,um in diameter are structurally a mixed popu￾lation. Along any arterial pathway the complete
muscle coat gives way to a spiral of muscle before
the vessel becomes non-muscular. This occurs at a
diameter larger than a capillary. In a given area of
a microscopic section all arteries below 300 ,um in
diameter are examined and their structure noted,
whether muscular, partially muscular, or non￾muscular. The proportion of each structural type
within a given size range is then calculated. Ex￾tension of muscle to the periphery is shown by a
shift to the left while dilatation is shown by a
shift to the right.
Vessel number-The number of arteries or veins
per unit area of lung section was calculated from
the number of filled vessels greater than 25 ,am
in an average of 50 microscopic fields using a low￾power objective, a unit area being taken as a
microscopic field. In the same area the number
of vessels was related to the number of alveoli
to minimise any difference caused by differences
in the degree of inflation of individual lungs.
A post-mortem lung biopsy was performed soon
after death in seven patients to provide material
for ultrastructural studies. Tissue was fixed for
one to four hours in 2% glutaraldehyde in cacody￾late buffer and then overnight in cacodylate buffer.
After post-fixation in 1% osmium tetroxide it was
dehydrated and embedded in Araldite. One ,um
sections were cut, stained with Toluidine blue in
1% borax, and studied by light microscopy. The
statistical significance of the difference in measure￾ments between subjects with FHF and the controls
was examined using Student's t test.
Results
MACROSCOPIC APPEARANCE
In eight of the 12 arterial injections numerous
short, spidery pleural vessels were filled, their fine
branches reminiscent of the cutaneous spider
naevus (fig 1). The number of such spiders varied.
In some cases they were sufficiently numerous to
cover completely an area of pleura while in others
they were fewer so that individual spiders could
be easily identified and counted, but their presence
contrasts strongly with the normal pleura in which
no vessels fill.
In one case (No 3) reflux of injection material
occurred from veins.
MICROSCOPIC APPEARANCE
The lung architecture was intact in all cases.
Figure 2a is a photomicrograph of the normal in￾jected and inflated lung and fig 2b of a case of
FHF illustrating the diffuse dilatation of intra￾acinar arteries, which was confirmed by the follow￾ing quantitative studies.
Size of arteries with airways (fig 3)-In control
lungs the mean external diameter of arteries ac￾companying respiratory bronchioles was 177-76 ,um
(+SD 18-24). In FHF it was 232-97 ,um (-+-SD
46 35) a statistically significant difference (P<0-01).
Similarly, for arteries accompanying alveolar ducts
the mean external diameter in FHF of 122-69 um
(-+1965) was significantly greater (P<0-01) than
that of the controls, 88-1 ,um (-+-17.59). The highest
values were found in those cases with pleural
spider naevi.
Percentage medial wall thickness (%WT)-The
mean %WT of arteries and veins of all sizes in
patients with FHF was less than normal, though
the difference was not statistically significant. No
significant difference was found between those
cases with pleural spider naevi and those without.
This thinning of the vessel wall is probably an
effect of dilatation.
Population counts (fig 4)-It seems that dilata￾tion affects arteries of all structural types as shown
by a shift in the population curve to the right.
This shift is produced by an increase in size of the
largest non-muscular, the largest partially muscu￾lar, and the smallest muscular arteries. A similar
shift in the venous population count was found.
The mean diameter of the smallest muscular vein
was 157-5 ,um (+SD 7 5) compared with a control
value of 80 Am (-i=20) (P<0 05). Similarly, the
largest non-muscular vein was 287 ,um (+27.5)
compared with 180 p,m (+5) in the controls
(P<0-05).
Vessel number-For the four controls the mean
number of arteries per unit area was 8-9 (+4SD
1 1) and for the 12 cases of FHF 9.9 (+3 03). The
difference is not statistically significant.
The number of veins per unit area was also
normal.

PRECAPILLARIES
Alveolar wall structure is seen in more detail in
1 ,um Toluidine sections (fig 5). In four of the
seven biopsies an increase in lumen size of alveolar
wall vessels was apparent. These vessels are not
filled by the injection technique and are therefore
not included in the counts described above. Un￾distended, the vessels are about 10-15 ,um in di￾ameter and can be considered precapillaries.
Discussion
These studies of the changes in acute liver failure
have shown for the first time that significant
structural changes develop in the pulmonary cir￾culation in this condition and that they can occur
rapidly. The essential nature of the structural ab￾normality is diffuse dilatation affecting all intra￾acinar vessels. In the pleura, spider naevi are
evidence of the severity of the dilatation, although
even when they are not present diffuse dilatation
of small subpleural vessels is found. These changes
are similar to those seen in cirrhosis of the liver,
although generally not as severe. The certain rec￾ognition and analysis of these changes were made
possible by the method of injection applied to the
pulmonary circulation and by subsequent radio￾graphic and quantitative morphometric analysis.
The preponderance of women can be ignored since
the response of the lung to aging or to disease
has been shown previously to be the same for
either sex (Hislop and Reid, 1973). The 1 [m
sections prepared from separate blocks of tissue,
although uninjected, showed that vessels beyond
the range of our injection were affected. This
change is seen both on the arterial and venous
side of the capillaries.
It is known that under the conditions used the
injection medium fills vessels down to 15 ,um in
diameter but does not cross the capillary bed
(Davies and Reid, 1970). In the one case in this
series in which reflux occurred this was within
seconds of the start of the arterial injection,
suggesting the presence of either a few major
precapillary arteriovenous communications or nu￾merous small ones. Since no major shunts were

dilated, the functional significance with respect to
"shunt" of the dilatation we have shown will be
even greater.
Lung scanning techniques support the functional
importance of the acute dilatation in cirrhosis of
the liver. Stanley and Woodgate (1972) reported
abnormal passage of intravenously injected albu￾min macroaggregates (average diameter exceeding
20 ,um) across the pulmonary vascular bed. Re￾cently in four patients with advanced liver disease
the fate of intravenous injection of radioactive
particles 20-80 ,um in diameter has been followed
by whole body scanning. In all, extrapulmonary
deposition occurred, the fraction escaping the pul￾monary capillary net being a measure of the
"shunt" (Wolfe et al, 1977).
The pathogenesis of the dilatation is not known.
Abnormalities of the systemic circulation have
long been recognised as a feature of liver disease￾such as cutaneous spider naevi and a raised cardiac
output (Bean, 1959). The mechanism for dilatation
in the pulmonary circulation may be similar to
those that operate in the systemic. In patients with
liver cirrhosis Daoud et al (1972) found that the

pulmonary circulation fails to respond to hypoxia
by vasoconstriction.
Although the degree of venous admixture does
not correlate with the degree of vascular dilatation
assessed under conditions of maximum distension,
absence of other pathological changes that would
explain such large shunts suggest that the dilata￾tion is functionally important. Arterial dilatation
could contribute to desaturation in several ways.
In three patients with portocaval shunts Cotes re￾ported reduced pulmonary diffusing capacity for
co (Cotes et al, 1968). He speculated that dilata￾tion of alveolar vessels by increasing relative per￾fusion to the dependent parts of the lung decreased
the effective surface available for gas exchange
and so reduced the DLCO. Other instances of a
reduced DLCO in CLD have been reported (Stanley
and Woodgate, 1971; Schomerus et al, 1975; Wolfe
et al, 1977). Although the precise mechanism is
not yet clear, dilatation of the vascular bed, par￾ticularly of the small arteries, is the most con￾sistent finding both in chronic and in fulminant
liver disease: in some way blood is diverted from
the region of gas exchange, although precapillary
anatomic shunts are rare. In fulminant liver failure
as in chronic liver disease blood may be diverted
through the pleural vessels: or the diffuse mild
dilatation of intra-alveolar wall arteries and capil￾laries may suffice to produce a functional shunt.
