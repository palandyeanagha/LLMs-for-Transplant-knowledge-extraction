Abstract
Introduction: Acute hepatitis E virus infection may cause mild, self-limiting hepatitis, either as epidemic outbreaks
or sporadic cases, the latter of which have been reported in industrialized countries. Chronic infections are
uncommon and have been reported in immunosuppressed patients, patients with human immunodeficiency virus
infection, and patients with hematological malignancies.
Case presentation: A 46-year-old Caucasian man was admitted to the gastroenterology clinic with a history of
increasing transaminases, persistent exhaustion, and occasional right-side abdominal pain over the course of a
6-month period. B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia had been diagnosed several years earlier, and the patient was
treated with rituximab, pentostatin, and cyclophosphamide. A diagnostic workup ruled out autoimmune and
metabolic liver disease, hepatitis A-C, and herpes virus infection. A physical examination revealed enlarged axillary
lymph nodes. The results of an abdominal ultrasound examination were otherwise unremarkable. Hepatitis E virus
infection was diagnosed by detection of hepatitis E virus-specific antibodies. Blood samples were positive for
hepatitis E virus ribonucleic acid with high viral loads for at least 8 months, demonstrating a rare chronic hepatitis E
virus infection. Sequencing and phylogenetic analysis revealed hepatitis E virus genotype 3c with homologies to
other European isolates from humans and swine, indicating an autochthonous infection.
Conclusions: Usually, hepatitis E virus infection appears as an acute infection; rare chronic infections have been
reported for transplant patients, patients with human immunodeficiency virus, and patients with hematological
malignancies. The chronic nature of hepatitis E infection in our patient was most likely induced by the
immunosuppressive B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia treatment. The differential diagnosis in patients with
unexplained hepatitis should include hepatitis E virus infection, and appropriate laboratory analyses should be
considered.

Introduction
Signs and symptoms of hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection
comprise jaundice, elevated transaminases, nausea, vomit￾ing, myalgia, abdominal pain, and fever. In some cases,
HEV infection may result in acute liver failure. The overall
disease mortality is low, but fulminant hepatitis is frequent
among pregnant women in HEV-endemic regions.
Chronic hepatitis with persistent viral replication has been
reported among transplant recipients infected shortly after
transplantation [1,2]. Moreover, reports about chronic
HEV infections in patients with concomitant human im￾munodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and patients with
hematological malignancies have been published [3-5].
Epidemic outbreaks in developing countries are typically
caused by HEV genotype 1 strains which are transmitted
from human to human via the fecal-oral route [6]. In con￾trast, sporadic HEV cases in industrialized countries are
most likely of zoonotic origin and usually are caused by

HEV genotype 3 strains. Sporadic cases have been
reported in France and other countries [7-9]. Only a few
reports on zoonotic HEV infections in Germany exist [10].
Interestingly, recent reports demonstrate a surprisingly
high HEV seroprevalence in German domestic pig stocks
[11] and in humans with occupational exposure to pigs
[12]. HEV-specific ribonucleic acid (RNA) was detected in
porcine livers in southeastern Germany with high se￾quence homology to human HEV isolates [13]. Given
these data, it is tempting to speculate that zoonotic and
alimentary transmission routes play a role in sporadic
human HEV cases, but the detailed mode of transmission
is still not well understood. The subject of our report is a
rare case of chronic HEV in an immunosuppressed patient
with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL).
Case presentation
A 46-year-old Caucasian man who worked as a mechanic
was transferred to the gastroenterology out-patient clinic
by the department of hematology, where he was regularly
treated for B-CLL. The reason for the visit was a continu￾ous increase of transaminases over the previous 7 months
(months 0 to 7). The patient reported persistent exhaus￾tion and occasional right-side abdominal pain. B-CLL had
been diagnosed 4 years earlier (initially Binet stage B; ac￾tual blood cell counts: leukocytes 13.6/nL, thrombocytes
224/nL, and hemoglobin 16.3g/dL). Owing to increasing
night sweats and compression of the urinary bladder by
lymphomas 2 years earlier (leukocyte count 61/nL), he
was treated with rituximab, pentostatin, and cyclophos￾phamide for 3 months, resulting in partial remission.
Maintenance therapy was performed by using rituximab
and was finally abandoned in month 4 of increased transa￾minases because of severe fatigue and susceptibility to
infections, after which the patient took no medication. At
the time of referral to our department, the patient was in
stable partial remission and B symptoms were absent. He
had no history of recent travels to countries outside

indicated in months (M). Intervals and types of chronic lymphocytic leukemia therapy are shown. The time scale on the x-axis is related to time
point “0 M”, when elevated transaminase concentrations were measured for the first time. This was also the time point at which rituximab was
administered for the last time. The diagnosis of HEV infection by positive HEV polymerase chain reaction was first made at 6.5 months; HEV RNA
concentrations at 0 and 5.25 months were measured retrospectively. Unfortunately, no earlier samples were available to show when HEV RNA
first appeared in the blood.

Germany, contact with animals, or consumption of ven￾ison, liver sausage, or offal. He had not received a blood
transfusion prior to the infection.
Normal alanine transaminase (ALT) was documented
in our patient until 10 months prior to his admission to
the gastroenterology department. No ALT results are
available in the 3-month interval from 10 months until 7
months prior to his transfer to the department of gastro￾enterology. Therefore, there is a 3-month window during
which the first increase of transaminases must have oc￾curred. An elevated ALT concentration of 234U/L was
first detected 7 months before referral to the department
of gastroenterology (the month of referral is denoted as
“month 0”). After the initial discovery of increased trans￾aminases, moderate fluctuating transaminitis – month 1:
aspartate transaminase (AST) 61U/L, ALT 139U/L;
month 3: AST 108U/L, ALT 220U/L; month 5: AST
142U/L, ALT 337U/L; and month 6: AST 161U/L, ALT
408U/L – was observed. Bilirubin concentrations were
repeatedly within the reference interval. A diagnostic
workup ruled out autoimmune and metabolic liver dis￾ease, hepatitis A-C, and herpes virus infection. A phys￾ical examination revealed enlarged axillary lymph nodes.
The results of an abdominal ultrasound examination
were otherwise unremarkable. Finally, HEV was diag￾nosed in a blood sample by detection of anti-HEV anti￾bodies and HEV RNA (month 7: 3.0×105 copies/mL).
Retrospectively, the presence of HEV RNA in serum was
confirmed in two earlier samples (month 0: 2.0×107 cop￾ies/mL and month 6: 1.0×107 copies/mL). Samples from
earlier visits were not available for analysis. Figure 1
shows ALT concentrations, HEV viral load, and phases
of immunosuppressive therapy over time. Sequence de￾termination and phylogenetic analysis revealed a novel
HEV genotype 3 strain clustering with other European
subgenotype 3c isolates (Figure 2).
Laboratory analyses ordered 10 days after referral to
our department showed that transaminases had rapidly
decreased to concentrations within the reference inter￾vals without therapeutic intervention (Figure 1). Four
weeks later (month 8), our patient was seen again in the
department of hematology; transaminase concentrations
were still normal, and HEV-RNA was not detectable
from blood. Thus, it may be concluded that HEV infec￾tion was spontaneously cleared 7 to 8 months after the
first referral. Lymphocyte counts in our patient’s blood
were 0.8/nL at month 0, 0.7/nL at month 6, 9.4/nL at
month 7, and 1.4/nL at month 8.
Discussion
In this case report, our patient is a man from southern
Germany with chronic autochthonous HEV infection. In
industrialized countries, HEV is generally perceived as an
imported disease, and travel to endemic regions is considered
the primary risk factor. The disease is endemic in many
countries in Asia and Africa and occurs both in sporadic
forms and in waterborne outbreaks. However, recent evi￾dence supporting the notion that autochthonous HEV infec￾tions are also widespread in many industrialized countries
has accumulated. Phylogenetic analyses have shown that
HEV genotype 1 is responsible for the majority of cases in
developing countries, whereas the prevalent HEV genotype
in Europe and North America is genotype 3 [10].
Our patient was referred to the department of gastro￾enterology with hepatitis of unknown origin. During a
diagnostic workup, HEV was identified as the underlying
disease. The diagnosis was based on three factors: first, a
moderate fluctuating transaminitis with an ALT ranging
from 61 to 408U/L, a typical pattern in chronic HEV in￾fection [14]; second, the detection of specific HEV anti￾bodies by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and
immunoblot; and, third, the direct detection of virus￾specific RNA by reverse transcription-quantitative poly￾merase chain reaction. Virus genotyping and subgenotyp￾ing were performed by sequencing and in silico
phylogenetic analysis and revealed HEV subgenotype 3c.
HEV RNA was detectable in three serum samples taken
over an 8-month period. Thus, our patient tested positive
for HEV RNA for more than 6 months, and this fits
the definition of chronic HEV infection. In the course of
an acute HEV infection, the highest level of viral nucleic
acid in the blood is present before the occurrence of
the first clinical symptoms and then rapidly declines in
immunocompetent patients. After the onset of clinical
symptoms, HEV RNA is usually detectable by polymerase
chain reaction for only 14 to 28 days from blood, plasma,
or serum. HEV genotype 3 has been reported for non￾travel-associated infections in industrialized countries.
Interestingly, a sequence database search revealed several
closely related HEV sequences derived from swine as well
as from humans in different European countries. In light
of these findings and a recent report on the detection
of HEV in porcine livers sold as food in southeastern
Germany [3], our patient was questioned about his ali￾mentary habits. However, ingestion of raw meat or offal
and contact with animals (including pigs) were denied.
Thus, the source of infection and mode of transmission
remain unclear. Several reports in the literature suggest
that patients under immunosuppression are at increased
risk of acquiring autochthonous HEV infection with pro￾longed viral replication and potentially severe clinical
consequences. Our patient had received therapy with anti￾CD20 antibodies, pentostatin, and cyclophosphamide for
his hematological malignancy. It is tempting to speculate
that the chronic course of his HEV infection was, in fact,
fueled by his therapeutically induced immunosuppression.
The first step in treating patients with chronic infections
is to reduce or stop immunosuppressive agents [14]. In

our case, rituximab therapy was stopped because of severe
fatigue and increased susceptibility to infections. Conse￾quently, our patient’s lymphocyte count in the blood
increased from 0.8/nL at the time of referral to 9.4/nL at
month 7. This may be interpreted as an indicator of a sim￾ultaneous immune reconstitution and thus could explain
the quick spontaneous clearance of the HEV infection and
hepatitis between months 7 and 8.
Notably, severe complications have also been observed
in patients with HEV infection after liver transplant￾ation. In a recently published case, undetected HEV in￾fection in a liver transplant donor actually caused
chronic HEV and cirrhosis in the recipient [15]. In
addition to acute and chronic HEV infections in patients
with hematological malignancies [3,5], patients with HIV
have been reported with chronic HEV [4].
In our patient, antiviral treatment was not initiated, be￾cause of the spontaneous recovery after immune reconsti￾tution. However, beyond reduction of immunosuppressive
therapy, treatment with ribavirin for at least 3 months
seems to be the first treatment option for patients with
chronic HEV, even though data are still limited [16].
Conclusions
HEV is still regarded by many health-care professionals
as a typical travel-associated disease. Consequently, HEV

is often excluded from the differential diagnoses if a pa￾tient with acute hepatitis has no history of travel to
known HEV-endemic regions. Thus, a considerable pro￾portion of autochthonous infections presumably remain
undiagnosed. In conclusion, patients with acute or
chronic hepatitis of unknown cause during immunosup￾pression should be tested for HEV infection. Moreover,
chronic courses of HEV must be considered in patients
under immunosuppressive therapy.
