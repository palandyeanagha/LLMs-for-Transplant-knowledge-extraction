SUMMARY
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TTC) is a rare but life￾threatening condition that is still not completely 
understood. Characterised by rapidly reversible 
ventricular dysfunction without any prior coronary artery 
disease, it can imitate a myocardial infarction and lead to 
death if not managed appropriately. This report examines 
a case of intraoperative cardiac arrest in a patient with 
no previous cardiac disease, and discusses the factors 
that may have precipitated this event, as well as the 
ways of distinguishing the cause of the arrest based on 
clinical course and investigations, eventually leading to a 
diagnosis of TTC.
BACKGROUND
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TTC) is a rare but life￾threatening condition characterised by transient left 
ventricular (LV) wall motion abnormality occur￾ring in the abscence of coronary artery disease.1
First described in 1990, its presentation mimics 
an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and is thought 
to comprise approximately 1%–2% of patients 
presenting with symptoms of ACS.2
 While several 
mechanisms have been suggested to explain its 
pathogenesis, the most widely accepted hypothesis 
suggests a catecholamine surge causing a ‘stun￾ning’ of the myocardium, leading to transient LV 
dysfunction.3
 This is supported by stress (physical or 
emotional) being implicated as a trigger for TTC.4
The incidence of perioperative TTC is estimated to 
be 1/6700 cases.5
 Diagnosis is typically based on 
meeting the clinical criteria as outlined by the Mayo 
clinic in 2008 (box 1).6
 While other criteria have 
been proposed,7
 the Mayo criteria is most widely 
accepted and used. Management is generally aimed 
at managing myocardial ischaemia with oxygen, 
anticoagulation (until a diagnosis of coronary artery 
disease is excluded) and beta-blockers.8
Cases of TTC are often associated with increased 
levels of serum catecholamines9
 and therefore 
agents that increase catecholamines (such as Selec￾tive Noradrenaline Re-uptake Inhibitors (SNRIs)) 
may be a contributing factor in development of 
the condition. The report below outlines a case of 
perioperative TTC in a patient taking duloxetine 
along with other precipitating factors.
CASE PRESENTATION
A 43-year-old woman presented for a surgical 
termination of pregnancy at 9 weeks’ gestation. She 
had a medical history of pneumococcal and strep￾tococcal sepsis in 2009 with multiorgan failure, 
resulting in a below-knee amputation. She had 
tolerated previous general anaesthetics for multiple 
skin grafts and a splenectomy in 2009. She also had 
a significant autoimmune history, including autoim￾mune hepatitis, hypothyroidism, neuropathic pain 
and depression. There was no documented cardio￾vascular or respiratory history. Her medications 
included duloxetine 60 mg daily (which she had 
been taking for the past 5 years), thyroxine 100 µg 
daily and prednisolone 5 mg daily for her autoim￾mune hepatitis. While she had also been prescribed 
amoxicillin as part of the post-splenectomy 
protocol, she was poorly compliant with it. Her 
baseline investigations including thyroid function 
tests were unremarkable.
The procedure was planned under moderate to 
deep sedation. Standard monitoring was applied. 
Initial haemodyamic parameters included: heart 
rate (HR) 100 beats/min; blood pressure (BP) 
90/60 mm Hg and oxygen saturation (SpO2
) 97% 
on room air. Supplemental oxygen at 6 L/min was 
administered through a Hudson-type facemask with 
end-tidal carbon dioxide monitoring. Immediately 
prior to her procedure, she received intravenous 10 
mg lignocaine, 600 µg atropine, 4 mg ondansetron 
and 75 µg fentanyl, followed by 50 mg of propofol 
to induce sedation. Once adequately sedated, the 
proceduralist injected 15 mL of 1% lignocaine and 
epinephrine 1:100 000 as part of cervical infiltra￾tion. The procedure was uneventful for the next 
10 min, and she required a second dose of 50 mg 
propofol. Shortly thereafter, the SpO2
 trace was 
consistent with a poor perfusion and a repeat (non￾invasive) BP showed a reading of 55/30 mm Hg. 
Two boluses of 0.5 mg metaraminol intravenously 
were immediately administered but did not improve 
the BP, and her peripheral pulses were not palpable. 
Subsequently, four aliquots of epinephrine intrave￾nously 25–50 µg were administered and additional 
peripheral intravenous access was established. With 
no change in her condition, cardiopulmonary resus￾citation was commenced using standard Advanced 
Life Support (ALS) protocols. She achieved return 
of spontaneous circulation after 32 min of CPR. 
Interventions after return of spontaneous circula￾tion included intermittent boluses of epinephrine 
to maintain BP, ventilation through a size 3 supra￾glottic airway (SGA) (‘i-gel’) and establishment of 
a femoral arterial line. An epinephrine infusion 
was commenced at 0.2–0.3 µg/kg/min and a right 
internal jugular central line access was established. 
She remained in sinus rhythm with HR between 
120 and 130 beats per minute. The first recorded 
invasive mean arterial pressure (MAP) was 60 mm 
Hg. Her MAP was maintained around 60–70 mm 
Hg with epinephrine and norepinephrine infusions

Case report
0.2–0.3 µg/kg/min. The post-resuscitation blood gas showed a 
metabolic acidosis with an elevated anion gap, consistent with a 
post-arrest state. Her hypokalaemia was corrected appropriately. 
The differentials considered at this stage were anaphylaxis, ACS 
or air/pulmonary embolism. Anaphylaxis was the primary differ￾ential at this stage, given the response to epinephrine; however, 
there were no other obvious systemic changes (ie, respiratory 
compromise, skin/mucosal tissue involvement) to indicate as 
such. A definitive airway was inserted to assist ventilation and 
facilitate ICU transfer. The procedure was allowed to continue, 
and on completion, she was transferred to the ICU.
A 12-lead ECG in the ICU showed T-wave inversion in the 
anteroseptal leads and a corrected QT interval of ~500 milli￾seconds (figure 1). A bedside formal echocardiogram revealed a 
normal sized LV with reduced systolic function and an ejection 
fraction of 33% (figure 2). The Echocardiogram (ECHO) also 
demonstrated akinesis of the LV apex with mid-distal LV wall 
hypo/akinesis (video 1). She had normal right heart pressures, 
making a diagnosis of pulmonary embolism unlikely. Her echo￾cardiogram findings were in keeping with acute cardiomyopathy. 
It was unclear at this stage whether this was secondary to intra￾operative ACS/TTC or anaphylaxis and what specifically had 
provoked the event.
Initial blood results showed normal tryptase levels of 4.8 
µg/L (normal <11.9 µg/L) . Her tryptase levels continued to 
be normal at 4 hours post event (4.4 µg/L) and 24 hours post 
event (3.7 µg/L). Given the uneventful induction of anaesthesia, 
the patient was not exposed to any further potential antigens 
immediately prior to her acute deterioration to indicate anaphy￾laxis had taken place. Although these findings did not preclude 
a diagnosis of anaphylaxis, they made it less likely. The patient’s 
initial troponin T (TnT) was elevated to 0.191 µg/L, and 
6-hour TnT was also elevated, however, began down-trending 
at 12 hours. While her initial N-terminal pro b-type natriuretic 
peptide (NT-proBNP) was normal at 98 ng/L, it was significantly 
elevated 16 and 40 hours later (table 1). Given the patient did 
not have any history of prior ACS or ischaemic heart disease, a 
preliminary diagnosis of TTC was given; however, this could 
only be affirmed with a repeat ECHO at 3 months showing a 
return of normal LV function (figure 2, video 2). It was thought 
that a combination of exogenous and endogenous factors 
(patient’s autoimmune history, medications, gender, operative

stress, cervical infiltration of epinephrine) had all contributed to 
precipitate TTC.
OUTCOME AND FOLLOW-UP
The patient was given an infusion of levosimenden in the ICU 
after consultation with the cardiology team, at 300 µg/hour, to 
optimise cardiac function and coronary blood flow. The catechol￾amines were weaned off over the next 12 hours. She remained 
stable overnight and was extubated the following day. She 
continued to make a full recovery and was discharged from the 
hospital 5 days later with a plan for outpatient cardiology review 
in 3 months time, with an echocardiogram to assess LV function 
prior to review. Repeat echocardiography at 3 months showed 
normal LV size and function, with an LVEF of 71% (video 2), 
helping to further affirm a diagnosis of TTC over ACS. Given the 
improvement in LV function and initial NT-proBNP changes, the 
cardiologist’s recommendation was that a formal angiography 
was not required at that stage to definitively exclude coronary 
pathology, and the patient would continue to receive ongoing 
cardiology follow-up and review as required.
DISCUSSION
TTC is generally precipitated by exposure to endogenous or 
exogenous stress. Plasma catecholamine levels in patients with 
TTC are approximately two to three times higher compared with 
patients presenting with myocardial infarction, suggesting that 
this is the primary mechanism underlying TTC.9
 It is hypoth￾esised that elevated levels of catecholamines result in changes 
to intracellular signal trafficking, leading to negative inotropic 
effects seen maximally at the apex of the myocardium.3
 Patients 
who present with TTC may have pre-existing endothelial 
dysfunction and reduced coronary artery reserve making them 
particularly susceptible to developing TTC during periods of 
acute stress,10 where circulating catecholamines are likely to be 
high. TTC tends to affect women predominantly; with about 
90% of the cases of TTC involving women,4
 however, it is 
unclear exactly why women are more susceptible to TTC.
The catecholamine surge results in LV dysfunction that is tran￾sient and reversible in nature.3
 In the perioperative setting, there 
are a number of potential factors, which may contribute to the 
hyper-catecholeminergic state. Agarwal et al, in a review, identi￾fied factors such as inadequate depth of anaesthesia, exogenous 
administration of epinephrine, anaphylaxis secondary to release 
of inflammatory mediators (Kounis syndrome) and ergometrine 
use after caesarean as potentially contributing to a hyper￾catecholeminergic state.11 Hessel estimated that TTC occurs in 
approximately 1/6700 cases.5
 In Hessel’s review, of 131 cases, 
37% presented during anaesthesia or surgery.
Perioperative TTC is more likely to present with evidence 
of heart failure, arrythmias or cardiac arrest5
 compared with 
the classical TTC where the presentation is similar to an ACS. 
However, recognising TTC perioperatively and differentiating 
it from ACS can still pose quite a challenge. Use of cardiac 
biomarkers can assist diagnosis in this regard. Compared with 
ACS, TTC tends to have a much higher peak NT-proBNP and a 
lower TnT rise, and therefore, the peak NT-proBNP:TnT ratio 
has shown to be effective in differentiating between TTC and 
ACS.12 A ratio cut-off of 2889 for ST-elevation ACS and 5000 
for non ST-elevation ACS has a 95% specificity for differenti￾ating between those types of ACS and TTC.12 Our case shows 
this, with the patient’s peak NT-proBNP:TnT ratio being 12 919 
(table 1), well above the aforementioned cut-offs for ACS. This 
ratio however is still only demonstrable post event and does not 
aid with recognition of TTC in the acute setting.
Duloxetine is a combined serotonin and norepinephrine 
reuptake inhibitor, and its effects are caused by increasing the 
levels of serotonin and norepinephrine at the neuronal synaptic 
terminals.13 Other SNRIs include venlafaxine and desvenlafaxine 
both of which are commonly prescribed for mood disorders. A 
systematic review of 22 cases of TTC by Hassan suggested that 
14 of these may be induced by SNRIs.14 Patients with pharmaco￾logically induced TTC tend to be younger compared with spon￾taneous TTC. They often also present without apical ballooning 
of the LV.14 There has been one reported case of TTC in the 
perioperative setting in a patient taking venlafaxine.15 We have 
not found a previously reported case of perioperative TTC in a 
patient taking duloxetine.
In our patient, the factors that may have contributed to an 
increased catecholaminergic state and subsequent TTC include: 
(1) long-term use of SNRI therapy; (2) emotional stress regarding 
the nature of the procedure and (3) exposure to exogenous cate￾cholamines through injection of local anaesthetic mixed with 
epinephrine prior to starting the procedure. Other contributing 
factors include the patient’s gender and the history of autoim￾mune disease, which could precipitate endothelial dysfunction.
While the exact aetiology and pathophysiology of TTC may 
still defy explanation, a high index of suspicion should be main￾tained for individuals who have the above risk factors and have 
a subsequent intraoperative cardiac arrest. Supportive therapy 
is key to management of TTC, and tests such as NT-proBNP as 
well as serial echocardiography can be of significant benefit in 
helping to differentiate TTC from ACS.

Learning points
► Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TTC) can occur in the 
perioperative setting not only under general anaesthesia 
but under sedation as well. Other factors may include 
intraoperative epinephrine administration, inadequate depth 
of anaesthesia and pre-existing conditions contributing to 
TTC.
► Use of NT-proBNP:troponin ratio can aid in differentiating TTC 
from acute coronary syndrome.
► Supportive therapy is key in management of TTC.
► A high index of suspicion for TTC must be present for patients 
who have a cardiac arrest with potential precipitating 
conditions, such as female gender, stress of event, pre￾existing autoimmune conditions and patients who are on 
SNRI therapy.
