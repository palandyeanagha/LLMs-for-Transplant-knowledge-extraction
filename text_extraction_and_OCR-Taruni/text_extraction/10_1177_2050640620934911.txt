Abstract
The overall objective of these guidelines is to provide evidence-based recommendations for the diagnosis and
management of immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4)-related digestive disease in adults and children. IgG4-related digestive
disease can be diagnosed only with a comprehensive work-up that includes histology, organ morphology at
imaging, serology, search for other organ involvement, and response to glucocorticoid treatment. Indications for
treatment are symptomatic patients with obstructive jaundice, abdominal pain, posterior pancreatic pain, and
involvement of extra-pancreatic digestive organs, including IgG4-related cholangitis. Treatment with glucocorti￾coids should be weight-based and initiated at a dose of 0.6–0.8 mg/kg body weight/day orally (typical starting dose
30-40 mg/day prednisone equivalent) for 1 month to induce remission and then be tapered within two additional
months. Response to initial treatment should be assessed at week 2–4 with clinical, biochemical and morphological
markers. Maintenance treatment with glucocorticoids should be considered in multi-organ disease or history of
relapse. If there is no change in disease activity and burden within 3 months, the diagnosis should be reconsidered.
If the disease relapsed during the 3 months of treatment, immunosuppressive drugs should be added.

Introduction and methodology
Aim of the guidelines
The overall objective of these guidelines is to provide
evidence-based recommendations for the diagnosis and
management of IgG4-related digestive disease in adults
and children. Target users of the guidelines are clini￾cians involved in the care of patients with IgG4-related
digestive disease.
Literature review
A comprehensive literature search for relevant articles
was performed using the PubMed, Embase, and
Cochrane databases was conducted.
The following keywords were used in various combi￾nations: “pancreas” OR “pancreatic” OR “pancreatitis”
AND “autoimmune” OR “IgG4” OR “rheumatoid”;
“cholangitis” OR cholagiopathy”; “other organ
involvement” OR “systemic disease”. Furthermore,
additional keywords were used by the working parties
to accommodate their specific topics, e.g. “therapy”,
“treatment”, children”, “pediatric”, “kidney”, etc. The
search was limited to human subjects with language
restriction to English studies until 1 September 2019.
The snowball strategy, including a manual search of
the references listed by studies retrieved from the
online databases and from previously published reviews,
was also performed to identify potential additional stud￾ies. The following inclusion criteria were used: (a)
randomized or observational cohort studies, including
systematic reviews, on patients with IgG4-related diges￾tive disease, which focused on specific study questions;
(b) studies published in the English language; and (c)
studies available in full text.
In view of the relatively small number of studies on
IgG4-related digestive disease, which is rare in every￾day clinical practice, even non-randomized studies with
less than 20 patients were used.
Recommendations, grades of evidence and
outcome reporting
The recommendations format comprised the question,

recommendation, and the percentage agreement
of the global consensus group with the final version.
Statements are followed by qualifying comments, writ￾ten by each working party (WP) (a list of abbreviations
is part of the supplement) and reviewed by the entire
scientific board (executive committee). Relevant com￾ments and suggestions made by the global consensus
group (expert readers) were also taken into
consideration.
The Grading of Recommendations Assessment,
Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system was
applied (Table S1). All participants and reviewers
used a GRADE system tutorial (link on UpToDate:
http://www.uptodate.com/home/grading-tutorial).
The final outcomes of the systematic reviews were
discussed among the members of each WP.
The review groups provided the following for each
clinical question:
1. Recommendation: the GRADE strength of recom￾mendation (1¼strong, 2¼weak) and the quality of
evidence (A¼high, B¼moderate, C¼low).
The first meeting of the group had taken place
during the United European Gastroenterology Week
(UEGW) in Vienna, Austria (October 2018). The
working groups were finalized and a responsible
leader for each group was named together with a
time manager. The Conflict of Interest forms were dis￾tributed to all participants and signed scanned copies
were sent to United European Gastroenterology
(UEG) central in Vienna according to UEG rules.
After the meeting in Vienna, we determined WPs,
members of the WP (Table S2) and proposals for ques￾tions. After all WPs completed the first draft of the
guidelines, the questions and statements were distribut￾ed among the entire expert group. The questions and
answers, including related comments, were uploaded to
the Delphi platform and voted upon. All questions
with less than 80% agreement were discussed at a meet￾ing during the European Pancreatic Club meeting in
Bergen, Norway (June 2019) with Test and
Evaluation Directorate (TED) voting. The comments
to all questions, and particularly those with less than
80% agreement during the TED voting, were returned
to the WP. A second round of the Delphi voting was
performed during autumn 2019 and the final round of
discussion, including TED voting, was performed
during the UEG week in Barcelona, Spain (October
2019). Following the consensus reached after the
UEG week (2019) and a final round of adjustments, a
first draft of the manuscript was prepared in December
2019 and was sent out to external readers and finalized
according to the comments received. In addition to this
written version, an interactive smartphone app was
developed (free download).
The working group received endorsements and
funding from UEG with Swedish Society of
Gastroenterology (SGF) as the National Society lead￾ing the development of these guidelines.

WP 1: Biomarkers in IgG4-related gastrointesti￾nal disease
Q1.1 Are there serum biomarkers that can be measured
to establish the diagnosis of IgG4-related gastrointestinal
disease?. Statement 1.1: IgG4 serum level alone lacks
sensitivity and specificity, but can be helpful to estab￾lish the diagnosis, and therefore should be measured if
IgG4-related gastrointestinal disease is suspected.
(GRADE 2C; strong agreement)
Comments: To diagnose IgG4-related disease, cur￾rent recommendations propose a comprehensive work￾up, including histology, organ morphology at imaging,
serology, search for other organ involvement, and
response to glucocorticoid treatment.1,2 Several
groups have reported a lack of sensitivity and specific￾ity of the IgG4 serum level to establish the diagnosis of
IgG4-related disease or to distinguish from primary
sclerosing cholangitis or cholangiocarcinoma.3–6 IgG4
serum levels seem to have diagnostic value when the
level is higher than four times the upper level of
normal, which is the case in only a minority of
patients.7 One large cohort study in the UK demon￾strated that only 22.4% of patients with IgG4 levels
above the normal range of 1.4 mg/ml fulfilled the cri￾teria to diagnose an IgG4-related disease. When the
cut-off level was set at 2.8 mg/ml, specificity increased
to 96%, whereas sensitivity was lost, and the positive
predictive value was less than 50%.8 Thus, new bio￾markers are urgently required, and preliminary studies
have reported promising results. Next-generation
sequencing identified that class-switched IgG4-positive
Lohr et al. € 639

clones were predominantly present in the IgG B-cell
receptor repertoire and were able to differentiate
active IgG4-related from other hepato-pancreato￾biliary disease.9,10 Finally, a quantitative polymerase
chain reaction (qPCR) assay was designed to analyse
the IgG4/IgG RNA ratio, which demonstrates promis￾ing potential for the efficient differentiation of IgG4-
cholangitis from malignancy and other inflammatory
processes. Further prospective trials are needed to
better understand the validity of this assay for IgG4-
related disease of the hepato-pancreato-biliary system,
as well as for systemic forms, although there are
already recommendations to include this test into
the diagnostic work-up of patients with suspected
IgG4-related disease.11 Finally, circulating plasma￾blasts and CC-chemokine ligand 18 (CCL18) levels
appear valuable in diagnosing IgG4-related diseases,
and monitoring the disease course.12 In addition, con￾firmation of preliminary results in larger cohorts is
warranted for both of these markers.
Q1.2. Does the measurement of IgG4 help to monitor the
disease course?. Statement 1.2: The measurement of
IgG4 serum levels to monitor the disease course may
be helpful in some patients. (GRADE 2C, strong
agreement)
Comments: As with its poor quality in establishing
the diagnosis of IgG4-related disease serum, IgG4
levels cannot contribute to accurately monitoring dis￾ease course, nor does it sufficiently correlate with the
development of complications or even with relapse.13,14
In certain cases, treatment induces normalization of
elevated IgG4 levels or a dramatic decrease, whereas
other patients exhibit normal IgG4 levels at initiation,
as shown for patients with second-line therapy with
immunomodulators.15 In another cohort, clinical
response with glucocorticoid treatment was achieved
and maintained, while serum IgG4 levels did not nor￾malize in 63% of patients.16 However, relapse rates
were significantly higher in patients with elevated
IgG4 levels compared with patients with normalization
of IgG4 (34/115, 30% versus 7/69, 10%; p¼0.003).16
Thus, serum IgG4 concentrations do not appear to be
reliable biomarkers of disease activity, except in a
minority of patients. In one study, circulating
immune complexes were reportedly useful predictors
of relapses, but these results have not been confirmed
yet.17 Interestingly, the IgG4/IgG RNA ratio correlat￾ed with response to glucocorticoid treatment in
20 patients with IgG4-related disease after 4 and
8 weeks, and as such, represents a promising novel bio￾marker to monitor the disease.9 These results, however,
need to be confirmed in larger cohorts before a general
recommendation on their validity can be made. Apart
from biomarkers alone, activity scores such as the
M-ANNHEIM-AiP-Activity-Score, including bio￾markers suitable for IgG4-related diseases, may help
in the future to predict and assess the effectiveness of
therapies.18
Q1.3. Is the measurement of the serum carbohydrate
antigen (CA) 19-9 level recommended to differentiate
autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP) from pancreatic
adenocarcinoma?. Statement 1.3: Elevated serum CA
19-9 levels are influenced by factors, such as cholangi￾tis, and when used alone CA 19-9 displays limited accu￾racy in differentiating AIP from pancreatic
adenocarcinoma, but given that it is an easy-to￾perform and cheap test with acceptable sensitivity
and specificity, its use integrated with other second￾level diagnostics (e.g. biopsy, computed tomography
(CT) scan) is encouraged. (GRADE 2C; strong
agreement)
Comments: For these guidelines, AIP is referring to
AIP type 1, i.e. IgG4-related autoimmune pancreatitis,
unless specified otherwise. AIP type 1 is a rare disease.
In contrast, pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a
relatively frequent tumour, being the 12th most fre￾quent cancer worldwide.19 A pancreatic mass caused
by AIP type 1 and PDAC is difficult to distinguish
with imaging techniques, thus biological markers may
aid in differential diagnoses. CA 19-9, a cheap, simple
test, is the most commonly used and best validated
serum tumour marker for PDAC; it has the best accu￾racy in patients with advanced PDAC.20 However, the
value of CA 19-9 measurement is limited if jaundice is
present. Studies addressing the diagnostic accuracy of
CA 19-9 to distinguish AIP from pancreatic cancer are
summarized in Table 1.21–23 Using different cut-offs for
CA 19-9, sensitivity and specificity ranged from 56 to
84% and 73 to 96%, respectively. Sensitivity and spe￾cificity improved by using different combinations with
other parameters (CA 19-9 plus IgG420,21 or CA 19-9,
eosinophil percentage, globulin and haemoglobin23),
but no validation cohorts have confirmed those strate￾gies with specific cut-offs. CA 19-9 should be consid￾ered in the diagnostic work-up, not as a single and
definitive marker of the presence or absence of pancre￾atic adenocarcinoma, but as a test to be interpreted
together with other clinical, laboratory, and imaging
characteristics of the patient.
WP 2: IgG4-related disease of the pancreas
Q2.1: What are the pathological characteristics of AIP
type 1?. Statement 2.1: There are four key histological
features of AIP type 1: (a) lymphoplasmacytic infiltra￾tion affecting the tissue either diffusely or in a patchy
manner, (b) storiform fibrosis, (c) obliterative phlebitis,
640 United European Gastroenterology Journal 8(6)

and (d) increased numbers of IgG4þ plasma cells.
(GRADE 1B; strong agreement)
Comments: There are four key histological features
of AIP type 1.24 Lymphoplasmacytic infiltration is
heavy within the lobules and focuses on medium￾sized ducts. Eosinophils are often, but not always, pre￾sent.25,26 The characteristic cartwheel appearance of
storiform fibrosis may be present only focally, while
cellular fibrosis with marked chronic inflammatory
cell infiltration is usually extensively present. Cellular
inflammation may become less apparent in long￾standing cases or following treatment.27 Obliterative
phlebitis presents as partial or complete venous oblit￾eration or as an inflammatory nodule next to a patent
artery. Elastica-van Gieson or Verhoeff staining may
be helpful. Immunohistochemical staining for IgG4 is
crucial for reaching a diagnosis of AIP type 1. For the
diagnosis of AIP, the number of IgG4þ plasma cells
should exceed 50 cells/high-power field (HPF) in surgi￾cal specimens and 10 cells/HPF in biopsy samples
(average of counts in three hot spots [400]). In addi￾tion, the IgG4/IgG ratio should be more than 40%.
Although an increased IgG4 plasma cell count is an
important finding, it is not diagnostic of AIP type 1 if
found in isolation.28,29 Especially for the evaluation of
needle biopsies, systems to categorize the likelihood
of AIP (highly suggestive, probable, inconclusive)
based on various combinations of features have been
proposed,1,24,30,31 but require clinical validation. A
biopsy showing little or no evidence of AIP cannot be
used in isolation to exclude this diagnosis, unless a pos￾itive alternative diagnosis can be made.30 Biopsies from
tumefactive lesions with lymphoplasmacytic infiltration
should be stained for IgG and IgG4, and elevated
counts should trigger clinical evaluation for AIP,
regardless of the presence or absence of storiform fibro￾sis or obliterative phlebitis.32
While AIP type 2 shares several features with AIP
type 1 (see Table 2), the presence of few or no IgG4þ
plasma cells in combination with the presence of
granulocytic epithelial lesions (GELs) is considered
confident histological evidence. GELs are characterized
by the infiltration of neutrophilic granulocytes in the
duct epithelial lining, causing degenerative epithelial
changes, often including epithelial detachment. The
presence of an acinar infiltrate, (including neutrophils),
in the absence of GELs or an elevated IgG4þ plasma
cell count (10/HPF) is regarded as a probable diag￾nosis of AIP type 2.1
Q2.2: What are the imaging features of AIP?. Statement
2.2: The classical imaging features of AIP are paren￾chymal enlargement, ‘sausage-like’ shape, peripancre￾atic edematous rim, and main pancreatic duct
narrowing without upstream dilatation. These features
may be diffuse or focal but can also be highly variable.

Comments: The imaging features below are depicted
using clinically available CT, magnetic resonance imag￾ing (MRI), ultrasound (US), and positron emission
tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT)
systems.8,33–41
Parenchymal changes suggestive of AIP are:
(i) Diffuse or (multi-) focal enlargement with loss of
the normal multilobulated pattern (‘sausage-like’
shape); with diffuse involvement, more frequent
in type 1 and focal involvement in AIP type 2
(Figure 1).
(ii) Altered imaging characteristics, such as lower
signal intensity (SI)/echogenicity on unenhanced
T1-w MRI/(E)US, respectively, moderately
higher SI on T2-w MRI, impeded diffusion on
MRI, and increased 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose
(FDG)-uptake on PET-CT compared with
normal parenchyma. Post injection of (iodine-,
gadolinium-, or microbubble-based) contrast
media, there is dotted/patchy enhancement in the
late arterial/pancreatic phase that progressively
increases towards the later vascular phases.
(iii) Rectangular shape of the tail (‘cut-tail sign’).
(iv) Thin peripancreatic edematous rim or progressive￾ly enhancing true capsule.
Ductal changes suggestive of AIP are:
(i) Long-segment (i.e. 1/3 of the length) or multi￾focal main pancreatic duct (MPD) involvement
(narrowing or vanishing) without upstream dilata￾tion or other signs of obstructive pancreatitis.
(ii) Skip lesions, i.e. 2 involved MPD-segments sep￾arated by a normal MPD-segment.
(iii) ‘Duct-penetrating’ (i.e. visible MPD- and/or
common bile duct (CBD)-lumen) and ‘icicle’ (i.e.
a progressive decrease of MPD-diameter) signs
within an enlarged parenchymal area.
Q2.3: What is the role of endoscopy in diagnoses of AIP
type 1?. Statement 2.3: Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)
provides pancreatic imaging findings suggestive of AIP
and is used for obtaining tissue samples for the histo￾logical diagnosis of the disease. (GRADE 2B; strong
agreement)
Comments: EUS plays a major role in the diagnosis
of AIP and IgG4-related cholangitis (IRC).1,42–45
AIP must be differentiated from pancreatic carcino￾ma.1,42–46 Pancreatography findings, such as a long
narrowing of the main pancreatic duct (>1/3 the
length of the MPD), lack of upstream dilatation,
skipped narrowed lesions, and side branches arising
from the narrowed portion, suggest AIP rather than
pancreatic carcinoma.1,42–45 IgG4-immunostaining of
biopsy specimens obtained from the major duodenal
papilla supports the diagnosis of AIP.1,43,45 IRC must
be differentiated from cholangiocarcinoma and prima￾ry sclerosing cholangitis (PSC).43–45 Specific cholangi￾ography findings support the diagnosis of IRC (see
below).43–45 IgG4-immunostaining of trans-papillary
biopsy specimens of bile duct strictures may help
exclude cholangiocarcinoma and support the diagnosis
of IRC.43–45 EUS may demonstrate diffuse hypoechoic
pancreatic enlargement and other features of pancreat￾ic disease in patients with AIP.43–45 EUS-guided tissue
acquisition is used for obtaining adequate tissue sam￾ples for the histological diagnosis of AIP and to
exclude pancreatic carcinoma.1,43–45 EUS-guided

needle, is recommended, but even use of a 22-gauge
needle for a sample allowing histological evaluation
can be obtained.43–45 EUS and intraductal ultrasonog￾raphy may show wall thickening of the CBD in patients
with IRC (see below).43–45
Q2.4: What is the role of surgery in AIP type 1?.
Statement 2.4: Surgery is generally not indicated for
AIP type 1. Surgery might be considered in patients
when suspicion of pancreatic cancer cannot be exclud￾ed after complete diagnostic work-up. (GRADE 2B;
strong agreement)
Comments: Diagnosis of AIP is not always straight￾forward and, in some cases, it is not easy to differenti￾ate it from pancreatic cancer. Furthermore, an
incidence of concomitant pancreatic tumours (benign
and malign) in patients with AIP has been reported in
up to 7% of cases.47 The International Study Group of
Pancreatic Surgery consensus statement reported that
5–13% of patients undergoing surgical resections
because of suspected malignancy had benign findings
on pathology, with AIP accounting for 30–43% of
these findings.48 In a retrospective study, including
pathological analysis of 274 patients who underwent
pancreaticoduodenectomy because of presumed malig￾nancy, the prevalence of benign disease was 8.4%, and
overall prevalence of AIP was 2.6%.49 European
patients treated with pancreatic resection with a post￾operative diagnosis of AIP were included in a multi￾centre study. There were 63 patients with AIP type 1
who underwent operations due to suspected pancreatic
cancer, intractable pain, or jaundice (or a combination
of these symptoms or signs). Relapse of disease after
surgery was 41.2%.50 In 74 patients from a North
American series undergoing pancreatectomy with the
final diagnosis of AIP, the long-term relapse rate of
17% was much lower.51 The long-term surgical out￾comes of 13 patients with pathologically diagnosed
type 1 AIP with immunohistochemical staining for
IgG4 were retrospectively compared with those of 34
patients with conventional chronic pancreatitis to eval￾uate the residual pancreatic function in Japanese
patients.52 Relapse of AIP, in terms of the clinical man￾ifestations and diagnostic imaging, was not found in
any of these patients during the postoperative course.
A study from the USA reported that eight out of 29
(28%) patients with AIP developed recurrence after
resection: seven with jaundice and one with recurrent
pancreatitis (median time to recurrence, 11 months;
median follow-up, 38 months).53 A possible cause of
these discrepancies in the reported recurrence rate of
AIP after surgery may be the difficulty in diagnosing a
recurrence of AIP in the remnant pancreas.52 However,
careful long-term follow-up is needed for patients
undergoing pancreatectomy for AIP type 1, as the
disease may return or remnant pancreatic function
can deteriorate as severely as that of patients who
undergo pancreatectomy for conventional chronic
pancreatitis.52
Q2.5: What is the expected outcome and optimal follow￾up of patients with AIP type 1?. Statement 2.5.1: AIP is a
special and treatable form of chronic pancreatitis with
a good response to initial glucocorticoid therapy, but
high rates of disease relapses. Other organ involvement
(OOI), defined as the presence of extra-pancreatic dis￾ease, is common. (GRADE 1A; strong agreement)
Statement 2.5.2: Long-term sequelae, such as exo￾crine and endocrine insufficiency, often occur in patients
with AIP type 1. (GRADE 1B; strong agreement)
Statement 2.5.3: Screening for a deficiency of fat￾soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K), zinc, calcium, and
magnesium should be considered in line with UEG
evidence-based guidelines for the diagnosis and therapy
of chronic pancreatitis (HaPanEU).54 (GRADE 2A;
strong agreement)
Statement 2.5.4: Life-long follow-up of patients with
AIP type 1 is advisable. (GRADE 2C; strong
agreement)
Comments: AIP is a special form of chronic pancre￾atitis with a good response to glucocorticoid therapy,
but high rate of disease relapses.13,55,56 Relapse occur￾rence in European studies varies from 7% to 55%.57–62
OOI, defined as the presence of extra-pancreatic dis￾ease, is reported in 47–84% of patients in different
European studies.57,59–62 The likelihood of pancreatic
exocrine insufficiency with all consequences is further
increased in patients with chronic pancreatitis, diabetes
mellitus, and after pancreatic resections.54 Deficiency
of fat-soluble vitamins, namely magnesium, zinc, calci￾um, iron, haemoglobin, albumin, and prealbumin, have
been associated with pancreatic insufficiency.54,63–66
Patients with all aetiologies of chronic pancreatitis,
including those of autoimmune cause, are also at high
risk of developing osteoporosis and osteopenia, espe￾cially in patients with glucocorticoid treatment.54,67,68
Pancreatic duct stones were reported in 5–40% of
patients with AIP.69,70 Known (exocrine and endocrine
insufficiency, pancreatic duct stones) long-term sequel￾ae require ongoing surveillance to further understand
their full clinical significance and, at this point, yearly
life-long follow-up of patients with AIP type 1 is
advisable.
WP 3: IgG4-related diseases of liver and bile
ducts
Q3.1. What is the definition and proposed nomenclature
of IgG4-related hepatobiliary disease?. Statement 3.1:
The most common manifestation of IgG4-related
Lohr et al. € 643

hepatobiliary disease is IgG4-related cholangitis.
(GRADE 2C; strong agreement)
Comments: Immunoglobulin G4-related hepatobili￾ary disease is the hepatobiliary manifestation of IgG4-
related systemic disease. IgG4-related hepatobiliary
disease mostly manifests as glucocorticoid-responsive
cholangitis of the extrahepatic and perihilar bile
ducts, but the intrahepatic bile ducts can also be
involved. IgG4-related hepatobiliary disease is often
associated with other organ manifestations of IgG4-
related disease, in particular autoimmune pancreatitis
type 1.71 Glucocorticoid-responsive cholangitis is the
most common manifestation of hepatobiliary disease,
but inflammatory pseudotumours of the liver and bili￾ary cirrhosis can also develop as a late-stage manifes￾tation of this condition. There is considerable doubt
that an IgG4-related hepatitis exists as a primary man￾ifestation of IgG4-related disease, partly because
IgG4þ plasma cell tissue infiltrations can be found in
the setting of various pathological conditions indepen￾dent of IgG4-related disease.72 The HISORt criteria
proposed by Ghazale et al.73 as diagnostic criteria for
IgG4-related cholangitis include histopathological and
imaging features, high serum IgG4 levels, other organ
involvement (e.g. pancreas, salivary/lacrimal/thyroid
glands, lungs, mediastinal and abdominal lymph
nodes, retroperitoneum, aorta, kidneys, ureters, pros￾tate or testes), and response to glucocorticoid therapy.
IgG-related cholecystitis also occurs. There is an ongo￾ing debate over the nomenclature of IgG4-related hep￾atobiliary disease. Among others, IgG4-related
cholangitis has been named IgG4-associated cholangi￾tis,71,73,74 IgG4-related sclerosing cholangitis,75,76
autoimmune cholangitis (in the past defined as anti￾mitochondrial antibodies (AMA)-negative primary
biliary cirrhosis,74 thus confusing), or IgG4 cholangi￾opathy. Worldwide use of the same term appears
highly desirable. The disease is completely reversible
under early glucocorticoid treatment, favouring the
terms IgG4-related cholangitis (IRC), IgG4-associated
cholangitis (IAC), or IgG4 cholangiopathy (IC),
whereas more advanced and irreversible stages are
reflected by the term IgG4-related sclerosing cholangi￾tis (IgG4-SC). The term IgG4-SC creates associations
in affected patients with PSC and, in particular, with
serum IgG4-positive PSC, a progressive disease with
dismal prognosis. In analogy with the name change
from cirrhosis to cholangitis in primary biliary cholan￾gitis, formerly primary biliary cirrhosis,77 we advocate,
for the sake of clarity for our patients, future use of the
more benign term, IgG4-related cholangitis (IRC), a
compromise between IAC and IgG4-SC. Accordingly,
IgG4-related hepatopathy (including IgG4-related
hepatic pseudotumours) and IgG4-related cholecystitis
are the nomenclature suggested for liver and
gallbladder involvement. It remains unclear if IgG4-
related hepatopathy truly is a manifestation distinct
from biliary tract involvement or rather a consequence
of IgG4-related cholangitis.
Q3.2. What are the clinical, biochemical, pathological,
and radiological characteristics leading to the diagnosis
of IgG4-related cholangitis?. Statement 3.2: Jaundice, a
cholestatic serum enzyme profile, includes elevated
serum IgG4 concentrations, histological features
(including lymphoplasmacellular infiltrates with >10
IgG4þ plasma cells/HPF, storiform fibrosis, and/or
obliterative phlebitis), and extrahepatic, hilar, and/or
intrahepatic bile duct strictures, which are characteris￾tic features of IgG4-related cholangitis. (GRADE 2C;
strong agreement)
Comments: Clinical signs and symptoms of IRC
include jaundice (mostly painless), pruritus, weight
loss, and abdominal discomfort. IgG4-related disease
is often associated with diabetes mellitus.73,78
Decompensated biliary cirrhosis or cholangiocarci￾noma are very rare at time of diagnosis.73,78
Biochemical characteristics of IRC are elevation of
serum markers of cholestasis, including alkaline phos￾phatase, gamma-glutamyl transferase, and conjugated
bilirubin. The ‘tumour marker’ CA19-9 can be exces￾sively high in IRC and responds rapidly to glucocorti￾coid treatment. Serum IgG4 is elevated in about 75%
of patients and reliable for the diagnosis of IgG4-
related disease when above 4 the upper limit of
normal.3,6 Moderate elevation of serum IgG4 is also
described in about 10% of patients with PSC, cholan￾giocarcinoma, pancreatitis, and pancreatic carcino￾ma.3,6,9 The blood IgG4/IgG RNA ratio, as
determined using qPCR, showed excellent accuracy
for the diagnosis of IRC (in comparison to PSC and
cholangio-/pancreatic carcinoma) in one study9 but
was rebutted in a large observational study with more
than 200 patients.79 Clearly, it requires prospective re￾evaluation in well-defined cohorts for further charac￾terization. Histopathological criteria of IRC include
lymphoplasmacellular infiltrates including >10 IgG4þ
plasma cells per HPF (defined as microscopic visible
area under 400-fold magnification), storiform fibrosis,
and obliterative phlebitis.24 Minor criteria include
eosinophilia and partial obliterative phlebitis.24
The diagnosis of IRC may be difficult without his￾tological sampling and, as it happens under ongoing
steroid therapy, since then IgG4 may be already
within normal range.80,81 The measurement of IgG sub￾class 2 (IgG2) may help in confirming the diagnosis of
IRC, as demonstrated in a recent study.82
Cholangiographic characteristics and a classification
are shown in Figure 2.83 Lower strictures of the CBD
without strictures of upstream bile ducts represent the
644 United European Gastroenterology Journal 8(6)

most common finding (type 1). Intrahepatic segmental
(type 2a) and diffuse (type 2b) strictures, in addition to
a lower CBD stricture, when taken together represent
the second most common finding. The combination of
hilar and lower CBD strictures (type 3) and hilar stric￾tures only (type 4) are additional variants.83
Q3.3. Is glucocorticoid treatment response indispensable
for the diagnosis of IgG4-related hepatobiliary disease?.
Statement 3.3: Treatment response is regarded as a
major diagnostic criterion but is not indispensable for
the diagnosis of IgG4-related cholangitis. (GRADE
2C; strong agreement)
Comments: To affirm that treatment response to
glucocorticoids represents a conditio sine qua non for
the diagnosis, it is necessary to retrieve the evidence
that almost 100% of patients are responders or that
treatment failure unequivocally excludes a definite
diagnosis of IgG4-related hepatobiliary disease. Based
on available literature, the question can be answered
only as far as IRC is concerned. No randomized con￾trolled study on the short-term treatment of IRC has
been performed and no randomized controlled trial has
been performed testing glucocorticoid-response as a
criterion for the diagnosis of IRC. Two prospective
studies84,85, six retrospective, observational cohort
studies (>20 patients each),73,78,86–89 and one systemat￾ic review90 evaluating the response to glucocorticoids
have been considered for analysis; different studies
have been excluded, as these were non-randomized
and with less than 20 patients enrolled. These
studies73,78,84–90 showed differences in inclusion criteria
and bile duct involvement, definition of response (clin￾ical, biochemical, radiologic), type of glucocorticoids,
doses and length of treatment, modalities of tapering,
and additional treatments (surgery, stenting).
Nonetheless, these studies demonstrated a rate of
response from 62 to 100% with a relapse of approxi￾mately 30% during glucocorticoid tapering or after
withdrawal of glucocorticoids. Despite advances in
the initial treatment and tapering/maintenance of glu￾cocorticoids, current available studies show how, based
on biliary tree imaging, treatment failure exists in a
minority of cases associated with a more fibrotic phe￾notype, multiple bile duct strictures, and multi-organ
involvement. We believe that further research is unlike￾ly to change our confidence in the estimate of benefit
and risk.
Q3.4. What are the evidence-based manifestations of
IgG4-related hepatobiliary disease in addition to IgG4-
related cholangitis?. Statement 3.4: IgG4-related chol￾angitis and IgG4-related hepatic pseudotumours are
hepatic manifestations within the spectrum of IgG4-
related disease. Other histopathological features of
liver tissue might also be interpreted as reactive changes
Type 1 64% Type 2 13%

due to IgG4-related cholangitis or autoimmune pancre￾atitis. (GRADE 2C; strong agreement)
Comments: In patients with AIP, five manifestations
of liver involvement were defined: (a) portal inflamma￾tion with or without interface activity, (b) lobular hep￾atitis, (c) portal sclerosis, (d) lobular (perivenular)
cholestasis, and (e) (large) bile duct obstructive pat￾tern.91 However, it may be very difficult to distinguish
primary hepatic involvement of IgG4-related disease,
including IRC, from reactive obstructive changes in
the liver secondary to AIP. The lobular hepatitis pat￾tern is considered by some as a separate entity, resem￾bling classical autoimmune hepatitis (AIH), with an
increasing number of IgG4-positive plasma cells. One
European and two Japanese cohorts described an
IgG4-associated AIH.92–94 However, diagnostic criteria
varied between the studies and the number of cases was
limited, so the clinical relevance of IgG4-associated
AIH remains unclear in the context of IgG4-related
disease and deserves further study. After liver trans￾plantation, the occurrence of a ‘post-transplant de
novo AIH’ has been described, sometimes called
‘plasma cell hepatitis’, with an important contribution
of IgG4-positive plasma cells. The relationship of this
entity to IgG4-related disease, if any, is highly ques￾tionable. Characteristic features, such as storiform
fibrosis or obliterative phlebitis, are lacking.95 Finally,
the occurrence of inflammatory (lymphoplasmacytic)
IgG4-positive pseudotumours is reported in the liver
in the context of IRC.96–99 In conclusion, different
manifestations of hepatic involvement of IgG4-related
disease are reported mostly in small, retrospective
cohort studies or case reports in which definitions of
disease entities varied between authors. Distinction
between reactive changes due to AIP and/or IRC and
primary hepatic manifestations of IgG4-relate disease
is often difficult.
WP 4: IgG4-related gastrointestinal disease of
esophagus, stomach, and bowel
Q4.1. How often do IgG4-related diseases occur in the
esophagus, stomach, and bowel?. Statement 4.1:
Involvement of esophagus, stomach, and bowel in
IgG4-related disease is rare or non-existing. (GRADE
2C; strong agreement)
Comments: Only single clinical observations100–102
and small series (groups)102-105of patients are pre￾sented. Topal et al.105 detected IgG4-positive plasma
cell staining in the colon biopsies of 21 out of 119
(17.6%) patients with inflammatory bowel disease
without AIP. Of these 21 patients, five displayed ele￾vated serum IgG4 levels (>140 mg/dl). Of the total,
4.2% (5/119) had both IgG4-immunstaining and
elevated IgG4 serum levels. Obiorah et al.103 evaluated
chronic esophagitis specimens with lymphoplasmacytic
infiltrate obtained over 6 years using a chart review.
IgG4 immunohistochemical staining of these specimens
confirmed the diagnoses of IgG4-related esophagitis in
eight out of 18 patients. Notohara et al.106 reported
seven clinical cases, found through a multicentre￾survey (these cases were found incidentally, detected
radiologically or pathologically). Sporadic cases were
reported also in small bowel (one case),100 pouchitis
(two cases),102 ileocecal region (one case),101 and
rectum (one case).107
Q4.2. What are the typical clinical features and diagnostic
criteria of IgG4-related disease in the esophagus, stom￾ach, and bowel?. Statement 4.2.1: Typical clinical fea￾tures and diagnostic criteria of IgG4-related disease of
the esophagus, stomach, and bowel have only rarely
been reported – and the reported cases are often incom￾plete regarding diagnostic criteria. (GRADE 2C;
strong agreement)
Comments 4.2.1: Based on the small observational
reports related to esophagus and stomach, histological
criteria are present in some cases, the same holds true
for IgG4-positive cells above the threshold of 50/HPF
and IgG4/IgG ratios above 40% as well as elevation of
serum IgG4 above 1.5 times the upper limit of
normal.1,2 For the bowel, only single case reports are
available, and the histological criteria are rarely
reported. Also, serum IgG4 is rarely reported/increased
for the bowel.105,108 Most cases are mainly based on
increased IgG4-positive cells,100,105,107–109 often with￾out reported IgG4/IgG ratios.107,108 Thus, there
remains major uncertainty regarding organ involve￾ment of the esophagus, stomach, and intestine in
IgG4-related disease.
Q4.3: What should be the treatment approach for IgG4-
related disease of the esophagus, stomach, or bowel?.
Statement 4.3.1. Pharmacological therapy of IgG4-
related disease of the gut is based on the same princi￾ples as IgG4-related disease of other organs. (GRADE
2C; strong agreement)
Statement 4.3.2. In a patient with gastrointestinal
mass lesion and equivocal/nondiagnostic histology for
IgG4-related disease with negative malignant cells,
empirical treatment with glucocorticoid for 1 month
may be a suitable option. (GRADE 2C; strong
agreement)
Comments: Most of the cases reported in the litera￾ture describe patients who were operated on for small
bowel masses without preoperative testing for IgG4
serum level, and the only indicator for the presence
646 United European Gastroenterology Journal 8(6)

of IgG4-related disease was postoperative histology.
Subsequently, patients received no glucocorticoid or
other immune-suppressive medications and had short
follow-up, if any.100,110–114 IgG4- related disease of the
gut, in many cases, was diagnosed postoperatively for
presumed tumour, and patients did not receive any
specific treatment with less than 6 months of follow￾up. Most patients were treated with surgical or
endoscopic resection, whereas a minority received glu￾cocorticoids and/or immunosuppressants. In most
cases, where glucocorticoid therapy was initiated,
patients exhibited good treatment response, though it
was incomplete in long-standing lesions, which could
be explained by the prominent fibrotic component of
the lesion. IgG4-related lesions of the stomach may
respond to antisecretory drugs.115 In few cases, patients
received maintenance treatment with immunosuppres￾sive agents (mycophenolate, cyclosporine, azathio￾prine), which appeared effective.116–118 Careful
monitoring of patients is also required, as in the natural
history of IgG4-related disease, further lesions may
appear as late as years after initial manifestation is
diagnosed and could be located in different organs.119
WP 5: Clinical manifestations and management
of systemic IgG4-related diseases
Q5.1 What is the spectrum of organ involvement and
clinical presentations in IgG4-related disease?.
Statement 5.1.1: Clinical manifestations of IgG4-
related disease are extremely variable depending on
the type and number of organ/tissues involved.
(GRADE 1A; strong agreement)
Statement 5.1.2: IgG4-related disease is a systemic
condition typically involving two or more organs.
(GRADE 1B; strong agreement)
Statement 5.1.3: The most frequently involved
organs are: the pancreato-hepatobiliary tract, salivary
and lacrimal glands, the retroperitoneum, kidneys,
lungs, and aorta. (GRADE 1A; strong agreement)
Comments: IgG4-related disease is a systemic con￾dition with 2 organs involved in as much as 75% of
patients in large case series.120–128 Different organ
involvement can occur at the same time or metachro￾nously (for example, at relapse). The patient’s history
should be screened cautiously, as previous medical
issues often reveal unrecognized manifestations of this
condition. IgG4-related disease classically affects
middle-aged individuals, but paediatric cases have
been described (see WP 6). IgG4-related disease clinical
manifestations are related to either the tumoural mass,
the stricture of tissues and/or organs by the tumour, or
signs of organ dysfunction. Sustained fever and consti￾tutional symptoms are not inherently associated with
IgG4-related disease, but can occur as complications of
the disease, e.g. ascending cholangitis occurring in the
setting of damaged bile ducts.122 IgG4-related disease
typically presents in the form of a tumour-like lesion
leading to compression of adjacent organs, strictures,
and, eventually, organ dysfunction. Neurological
symptoms, for instance, may occur in cases of menin￾geal involvement, and abdominal, flank, and/or lower
back pain may occur in cases of retroperitoneal fibro￾sis.129 Tumour masses can be identified by clinical
examination or imaging studies.129 According to the
largest international cohorts of patients with IgG4-
related disease, the most frequently involved organs
are: the pancreato-hepatobiliary tract (45%), major
salivary glands (37%), the lacrimal gland (26%),
the retroperitoneum (15%), the kidneys (15%),
the lungs (14%), and the aorta (10%).122 IgG4-
related disease is also frequently associated with
enlarged lymph nodes, but the pathological relevance
of isolated lymph node involvement in the absence of
other characteristic IgG4-related disease manifesta￾tions remains to be fully elucidated. Other localizations
of IgG4-related disease include: arteries (other than
aorta), orbits, meninges, prostate, testicles, skin, nasal
sinuses, mesentery, mediastinum, pericardium, pleura,
peripheral nerves, bones, and muscles.120–122,124–128,130
Based partly on organ involvement, four clinical phe￾notypes of IgG4-related disease have been proposed:
(a) pancreato-hepato-biliary disease; (b) retroperitone￾al fibrosis and/or aortitis; (c) head and neck-limited
disease; and (d) classic Mikulicz syndrome with system￾ic involvement. There is considerable overlap in several
of these proposed phenotypes, however, and the bio￾logical basis (and ultimate validity) of the proposed
phenotypes is not clear. IgG4-related disease pheno￾types differ in terms of demographical and serological
features. The ‘head and neck’ phenotype, for instance,
is more frequently observed in female patients,
although the overall prevalence of IgG4-related disease
is higher in male individuals. ‘Mikulicz syndrome with
systemic involvement’ is the IgG4-related disease phe￾notype associated with higher levels of serum IgG4.122
Q5.2 What is the optimal diagnostic work-up and follow￾up strategy for IgG4-related disease?. Statement 5.2.1:
The most accurate diagnostic assessment of IgG4-
related disease is based on a full clinical history, phys￾ical examination, laboratory investigations, pathology,
and imaging studies. Life-long follow-up of patients
with IgG4-related disease is advisable. (GRADE 1B;
strong agreement)
Statement 5.2.2: Whenever possible the diagnosis of
IgG4-related disease should be confirmed by
Lohr et al. € 647

pathological examination from a guided biopsy.
(GRADE 1A; strong agreement)
Statement 5.2.3: Patients with systemic manifesta￾tions of IgG4-related disease should be followed over
time with specific serological exams and imaging stud￾ies depending on the spectrum of organ involvement, as
well as with the IgG4-RD Responder Index. (GRADE
1C; strong agreement)
Comments: Appropriate diagnostic work-up and
follow-up strategies for systemic IgG4-related disease
requires integrated information from clinical history,
physical examination, laboratory investigations,
pathology findings, and imaging studies.131 Available
biomarkers, in fact, are not sufficiently accurate for
either diagnostic purpose or for longitudinal assess￾ment.131 Serum IgG4 measurement, for instance, the
most widely used biomarker of IgG4-related disease,
has a specificity of 60% and a positive predictive
value of only 34%, being elevated in several other
inflammatory disorders and normal in up to 50% of
patients with IgG4-related disease (see also WP1; Q1).
Circulating plasma blasts, T-follicular helper cells, and
CCL18 serum levels are associated with disease activ￾ity, but their utility as disease biomarkers has not
been validated in prospective studies.132–137 Similarly,
the IgG4/IgG RNA ratio on peripheral blood (see
also WP1; Q1) reliably distinguishes pancreato￾biliary IgG4-related disease from PSC or cholangio￾carcinoma, but its utility in the evaluation of patients
with extra-gastrointestinal manifestations of IgG4-
related disease has never been confirmed. Definitive
diagnosis of IgG4-related disease, therefore, still
relies on pathological examination of biopsy speci￾mens, and requires fulfilment of the organ-specific cri￾teria outlined in the ‘Consensus statement on the
pathology of IgG4-RD’. Conversely, comprehensive
evaluation of blood test, imaging, and functional
studies remains the cornerstone for an appropriate
follow-up strategy. Laboratory exams should include
complete blood cell count, liver and renal function
tests, serum protein electrophoresis, and measurement
of IgG subclasses and complement. Imaging studies –
including CT, MRI, and US – should be decided
according to the spectrum of organs involved.131
Finally, functional assessment through 18F-FDG
PET/CT can be used to distinguish active disease
from chronic fibrotic damage and to reveal asymp￾tomatic localizations of IgG4-related disease.132,136–
139 The IgG4-RD Responder Index (IgG4-RD RI,
Table S3) currently represents the only validated
score to monitor IgG4-related disease activity and to
combine all aforementioned clinical, serological, and
radiological information.140 In particular, the IgG4-
RD RI collects information regarding disease activity
(through a 0–3 organ/site score), symptoms, need for
urgent care, and organ damage. An IgG4-RD RI
score of 3 was recently used to identify patients
with active disease.140
Q5.3 How do we assess disease activity and differentiate
chronic damage from active lesions in IgG4-related dis￾ease?. Statement 5.3.1: There is no reliable biological
marker to assess disease activity on its own. (GRADE
1A; strong agreement)
Statement 5.3.2: IgG4-RD Responder Index can
assess changes in multi-organ disease activity and is
now being used in multicentre clinical trials.
(GRADE 1C; strong agreement)
Statement 5.3.3: The most accurate assessment of
IgG4-related disease activity relies on the combination
of findings from physical examination, laboratory
exams, histology, and imaging studies. (GRADE 1B;
strong agreement)
Comments: Reliable assessment of disease activity
and end-stage disease-related fibrosis poses significant
challenges to clinicians due to the multi-organ nature
of this condition. A combination of factors is typically
assessed to define IgG4-related disease activity, but
none of these alone is sufficiently specific and sensitive
from patient to patient to reliably capture the overall
disease status. Different biomarkers have been pro￾posed to reflect IgG4-related disease activity, including
serum IgG4 levels, circulating plasmablasts, the IgG4/
IgG RNA-ratio, CCL18, complement, organ-specific
enzymes, and renal function in peripheral
blood.9,12,121,123,124,141–147 Plasmablasts are elevated in
a proportion of patients presenting with normal serum
IgG4 levels at diagnosis and normalize with disease
remission in most cases.12,133,144,148,149 Imaging is com￾plementary and represents a reliable tool for assessing
systemic involvement of IgG4-related disease, response
to immunosuppressive therapy, and disease relapse. US
(for salivary glands), contrast enhanced CT scan, and
MRI play central roles in differentiating active disease
from organ-specific damage related to fibrosis.150–154
In general, active tissue inflammation and end-stage
fibrosis display characteristic radiologic features.152
18F-FDG uptake reflects the pathological expansion
of circulating plasmablasts, rather than processes relat￾ed to fibroblast activation, and is useful to differentiate
IgG4-related disease activity from end-stage fibro￾sis.132,137,138,153,154 IgG4-RD RI represents a promising
tool for evaluating IgG4-related disease activity in a
systematic manner, by integrating clinical, laboratory,
and imaging information.140 Experience with sequen￾tial assessment of the IgG4-RD RI in randomized clin￾ical trials, however, remains limited.

WP 6: IgG4-related digestive diseases in children
Q6.1: What is the prevalence of IgG4-related digestive
disease in children?. Statement 6.1: There are currently
insufficient data regarding prevalence of IgG4-related
digestive disease in children. IgG4-related digestive dis￾ease is extremely rare in childhood. The most common
IgG4-related digestive disease in the paediatric popula￾tion is AIP type I, which is rare, but the accurate prev￾alence remains unknown. (GRADE 2C; strong
agreement)
Comments: IgG4-related digestive diseases are
increasingly recognized; however, the underlying aeti￾ology remains unclear. The average age of patients with
IgG4-related disease is reported to be older than 50
years,155 and data in the paediatric population is limit￾ed. Improved awareness may increase detection of
IgG4-related disease in children. Our systematic litera￾ture search on paediatric patients with IgG4-related
digestive disease indicated that there are fewer than
100 published cases to date; with regard to pancreatitis,
these are AIP type 2.156–161
Q6.2: What is the difference in diagnosis of IgG4-related
digestive diseases in childhood compared with adults?.
Statement 6.2.1: There are currently insufficient data
regarding differences in diagnosis of IgG4-related
digestive disease in children. The diagnosis of IgG4-
related digestive disease in children should be based
on adult criteria, in the absence of paediatric consensus
on diagnostic criteria. (GRADE 2C; strong agreement)
Comments: One characteristic of IgG4-related
digestive disease is unexplained enlargement of one or
more organs in both children and adults. Compared
with adult patients, in whom malignancy must be
excluded, cancer is a rare diagnosis in children, in
whom infectious and other inflammatory disorders
are more common. In adults elevated IgG4 serum
levels and diagnosis of AIP type I are more common
than in children, where most published cases are AIP
type II.158–160 In the diagnostic work-up, obtaining
proper biopsies is challenging due to the difficulty of
EUS or endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatogra￾phy (ERCP) in children. One of the reasons the IgG4
cut-off level is proposed is to distinguish IgG4-related
diseases from other conditions, like malignancy
(including cholangiocarcinoma and pancreatic
cancer), that do not affect children in the same extent
as adults.162 The application of adult cut-off values for
IgG4 may be inappropriate for paediatric patients, but
there are no data available. Some 70% of the histolog￾ically confirmed cases displayed elevated IgG4 serum
levels compared with 48 paediatric AIP cases, where
elevated serum IgG4 levels were observed in 9/48
(22%) of spatients.158
Comments: Current classification of paediatric auto￾immune liver diseases comprise AIH and autoimmune
sclerosing cholangitis, which is a form of sclerosing
cholangitis with strong autoimmune features overlap￾ping with AIH, originally described at paediatric age
and affecting children more frequently than adults.163
The extent of IgG4-related component involvement in
these conditions remains unclear. Evaluation for IgG4-
related histopathological features should be considered
in children with diagnosed autoimmune liver disease
and concomitant AIP or other IgG4 disorders.
Growing awareness and prospective studies are man￾datory to establish proper definitions, improve under￾standing of pathogenesis and natural course, and assess
response to treatment in paediatric IgG4-related liver
disorders.
Q6.3: What are the differences in approaches to
treatment of IgG4-related digestive disease in children
as opposed to adults?. Statement 6.3.1: There are cur￾rently insufficient data regarding different treatments
of IgG4-related digestive diseases in children.
(GRADE 2C; strong agreement)
Statement 6.3.2: There are currently insufficient data
on the differences in treatment of IgG4-related liver
disorders in children compared with adults. (GRADE
2C; strong agreement)
Comments: Because of the lack of data, it is not
possible to provide evidenced recommendations for
treatment of IgG4-related liver diseases. Nevertheless,
in IRC it seems prudent to follow current paediatric
guidelines, where glucocorticoids, immunomodulators,
and ursodeoxycholic acid remain the mainstay of
treatment.164
Indications for ERCP with balloon dilatation are
limited and may be considered individually in cases
of dominant or symptomatic biliary strictures.164,165
Q6.4: What are the clinical manifestations of AIP type I in
children?. Statement 6.4.1: The classic form of AIP
(type 1) is rarely diagnosed in childhood. The diagnosis
of AIP, in the absence of paediatric consensus on diag￾nostic criteria, should be carried out at a specialized
paediatric pancreatic centre based on adult criteria.
There is currently insufficient data about transition
from AIP to chronic pancreatitis in the paediatric pop￾ulation. (GRADE 2C; strong agreement)
Statement 6.4.2: Children with AIP type 1 may pre￾sent acutely with jaundice, pancreatic mass, pain, vom￾iting, and weight loss. Patients usually respond well to
glucocorticoid therapy with a lower likelihood of recur￾rence. Some paediatric patients may exhibit resolution
of symptoms without any treatment. (GRADE 2C;
strong agreement)
Lohr et al. € 649

Statement 6.4.3: Transabdominal ultrasonography
is recommended as the ‘first step’ in a diagnostic
work-up. In the suspicion of AIP, presence of pancreas
enlargement, or pancreatic mass lesions with jaundice,
magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography
(MRCP) and/or EUS is recommended. (GRADE 2C;
strong agreement)
Statement 6.4.4: Pancreatic biopsy is not necessary
to start immunosuppressive treatment. (GRADE 2C;
strong agreement)
Statement 6.4.5: Glucocorticoids are the first line of
treatment for remission induction, unless there are con￾traindications for their use. Children with AIP type 1
inflammation with low disease activity at the beginning
of treatment do not require any maintenance treat￾ment. (GRADE 2C; strong agreement)
Comments: Published data regarding AIP incidence
in children are limited and AIP type 2 is predominant
(not associated with IgG4). Due to sporadic case
reports of AIP and rarely elevated IgG4 levels in chil￾dren with a final diagnosis of AIP type 1, the diagnosis
may be more difficult than in adults.158–160 Paediatric
AIP is often characterized by sudden onset with vari￾able symptoms, most commonly including painless
jaundice and general weakness. Abdominal pain, if
any, is mild, whereas episodes of acute pancreatitis
are rarely the first manifestation of the disease.
Imaging studies often reveal diffuse enlargement or
focal changes in pancreas. AIP can also be asymptom￾atic, with abnormalities present only in laboratory tests
and diagnostic imaging. Some paediatric patients may
experience resolution of symptoms without any thera￾py. However, there are no long-term data comparing
complications or recurrence rates with and without
treatment.166 Description of IgG4 tissue infiltration is
rare in published paediatric AIP cases.158–160,166,167
EUS-guided biopsy or brushings obtained from
ERCP should be considered in cases of pancreatitis
associated with pancreatic mass;168 however, is not nec￾essary for initiation of treatment, mostly because of the
very low incidence of tumours in this population.169
There are currently no data regarding the number of
IgG4þ plasma cells per HPF that should be present in
different gastrointestinal tissues in children. Among 48
AIP paediatric patients, collected from literature
review and International Study Group of Pediatric
Pancreatitis: In search for a cure (INSPPIRE) data￾base, lymphoplasmacytic inflammation, pancreatic
fibrosis, and ductal granulocyte infiltration were the
main histological findings in 18/25 patients (72%).158
INSPPIRE recommends oral prednisolone as a
first-line treatment at a dose of 1–1.5 mg/kg/day to
maximum 40–60 mg given in one or two divided
doses for 2–4 weeks. Thereafter, the dose should be
tapered. In case of relapse, a new course of predniso￾lone is recommended.166
WP 7: IgG4-related digestive disease and dia￾betes mellitus
Q7.1 What is the prevalence of diabetes mellitus in IgG4-
related disease of the pancreas?. Statement 7.1:
Diabetes mellitus is very common in IgG4-related dis￾ease of the pancreas (AIP type 1). Its prevalence ranges
between 21% and 77%. (GRADE 2C; strong
agreement)
Comments: Diabetes mellitus associated with auto￾immune pancreatitis is a ‘pancreatogenic’ form of
diabetes mellitus. There are very few studies and
small case series addressing the prevalence of diabetes
in IgG4-RD of the pancreas. They all report a rather
high prevalence of diabetes mellitus in patients with
type 1 AIP, ranging from 21% in a Swedish study pop￾ulation61 up to 77% in a Japanese study population.170
Most patients seem to develop diabetes mellitus simul￾taneously with the onset of type 1 AIP (53%).
However, there is a subset of patients exhibiting diabe￾tes mellitus before AIP type 1 onset (33%) and a subset
of patients developing or exacerbating diabetes mellitus
as a complication of glucocorticoid treatment.171–173
Unlike the course of classical chronic pancreatitis, its
prevalence appears to not rise with the duration of the
disease, possibly as glucocorticoid treatment might
ameliorate the disease course. Notably, in a study
investigating glucose tolerance and diabetes mellitus
in patients with IgG4-related disease, with AIP ruled
out, 52% of cases suffered from diabetes mellitus and a
further 17% displayed impaired glucose tolerance, with
insulin secretion being preserved in most patients and a
high prevalence of glucagon hyper-reactivity.174
Q7.2 Are there any features of IgG4-related disease of the
pancreas associated with the risk and/or severity of dia￾betes mellitus?. Statement 7.2: Among patients with
IgG4-RD of the pancreas (AIP type 1), radiologically
defined pancreatic atrophy, pancreatic exocrine insuffi￾ciency, age, and smoking are all associated with a sig￾nificantly higher risk of diabetes mellitus, while there
are no specific data on features associated with the
severity of diabetes mellitus. (GRADE 2C; strong
agreement)
Comments: There are few studies investigating fea￾tures associated with the risk of diabetes mellitus in
patients with IgG4-related disease. Most of these stud￾ies investigate patients with AIP without distinction
between the 2 subtypes. Frulloni et al. investigated
the exocrine and endocrine pancreatic function in 21
patients with AIP, and reported that all five patients
(24% of total) with diabetes mellitus exhibited very low
650 United European Gastroenterology Journal 8(6)

levels of faecal elastase-1 concentrations of
<19 mg/g.175 Patients with diabetes mellitus were also
older than patients without diabetes mellitus.175 Maire
and colleagues reported data on 96 patients with type 1
(73%) or type 2 (27%) AIP. Smokers (>10 pack/years)
presented with diabetes mellitus more frequently (50%
vs. 27%, p <0.04) compared with no/low-amount
smokers.176 The rate of diabetes mellitus is higher in
patients with AIP type 1 as compared with AIP type 2
in most published series. Rates of diabetes of 68% vs.
14%,106 23% vs. 11%,61 36% vs. 40%,62 and 40% vs.
22%13 have been reported in AIP type 1 vs. AIP type 2,
globally suggesting that pancreatic endocrine dysfunc￾tion is more common in IgG4-RD. Pancreatic atrophy
has also been associated with an increased risk of dia￾betes mellitus by Masuda and colleagues, who reported
a 75% incidence of diabetes mellitus in cases with pan￾creatic atrophy, as assessed by CT scan, compared with
10% in cases without pancreatic atrophy.177 There are
no specific studies regarding the association between
the severity of diabetes and features of IgG4-RD. It
has been reported that insulin requirement, which can
be a proxy of severity of diabetes mellitus, is more
common in type 1 AIP compared with type 2 AIP.13
Q7.3. What is the impact of glucocorticoid/
immunosuppressive treatment on the risk and/or
severity of diabetes mellitus in IgG4-related disease of
the pancreas?. Statement 7.3: Glucocorticoid treat￾ment of IgG4-related disease of the pancreas (AIP
type 1) induces beneficial effects on the clinical course
of diabetes mellitus in approximately 50–60% of all
cases. Patients with simultaneous-onset diabetes melli￾tus show greater glucocorticoid responsiveness than
patients with pre-existing diabetes mellitus. (GRADE
2C; strong agreement)
Comments: There are only a few studies with small
numbers of patients addressing the impact of glucocor￾ticoid treatment on type 1 AIP. Nearly all studies, how￾ever, describe an improvement of diabetes mellitus in
more than half of the patients. Nishimori and colleagues
conducted a nationwide survey in Japan and found an
improvement in diabetes mellitus, concerning parameters
of glucose control, in 55% of patients with simultaneous￾onset diabetes. However, only 36% of patients with pre￾existing diabetes mellitus improved and 20% showed an
exacerbation or new-onset diabetes mellitus following
glucocorticoid treatment.178 Miyamoto and colleagues
evaluated 69 patients for short- and long-term outcome
of diabetes mellitus in type 1 AIP after glucocorticoid
therapy in a retrospective study. They describe similar
results, with improvement rates of 55–66% for
simultaneous-onset diabetes mellitus, as well as for pre￾existing diabetes mellitus. Worsening is only reported in
9–15% of cases with at least 3 months of treatment.
This group also evaluated the effect of long-term gluco￾corticoid treatment on diabetes mellitus in patients with
at least 3 years of treatment. The rate of improvement
rises up to 66% with none of the patients reporting wors￾ening after 3 years.179 In a smaller series, the diabetes
rate increased from 24% to 48% during glucocorticoid
treatment, but eventually dropped to 19% at the end of
tapering, also confirming a positive effect of long-term
glucocorticoid treatment.175
WP 8: IgG4-related digestive disease and cancer
Q8.1 What is the risk of cancer development in the context
of IgG4-related disease?. Statement 8.1: IgG4-related
disease, and particularly AIP, may be associated with
an increased risk of developing malignant disease com￾pared with the general population. Life-long surveil￾lance in patients with IgG4-related disease is advised.
(GRADE 2C; strong agreement)
Comments: Several studies (Table 3) have investigat￾ed the risk of various malignancies in patients with
IgG4-related disease.126,180–184 In one study, the inci￾dence of malignancies in patients with IgG4-related dis￾ease was similar to the general population.180 In the
remaining studies, the risk of malignancy development
was significantly increased in patients with
IgG4-related disease compared with the general popu￾lation.181–184 Other investigations focused on the risk of
malignancy development in patients with AIP.185–188
Patients with AIP, diagnosed by Asian diagnostic cri￾teria, revealed a high risk of developing various can￾cers.185 The highest risk of cancer occurred in the first
year after AIP diagnosis, and the absence of an AIP
relapse after successful cancer treatment suggested that
AIP may represent a paraneoplastic syndrome in cer￾tain individuals with AIP.185 In line with this observa￾tion, an investigation of a mixed cohort of patients with
various forms of AIP demonstrated that the risk of
malignancy significantly increased compared with the
general population.186 In contrast, another investiga￾tion observed a similar cancer risk in patients with
AIP, before and after diagnosis, compared with control
subjects.187 In an investigation of patients with type 1
AIP, no pancreatic cancer occurred in any patient.188
The investigation of all malignant diseases in a pro￾spective cohort of patients with type 1 AIP revealed
that malignancy occurred in 11% shortly before or
after diagnosis of IgG4-RD, including three hepatic,
biliary, or pancreatic cancers.84 The risk of any
cancer at diagnosis or during follow-up was significant￾ly increased compared with matched national statis￾tics.84 In summary, various malignant diseases (e.g.
lung cancer, colon cancer, pancreatic cancer, bladder
cancer, lymphoma, leukaemia, and others) occurred in
patients with IgG4-related disease. Several lines of
Lohr et al. € 651

evidence suggest that IgG4-related disease might be
associated with an increased risk of development of
malignant diseases. However, these data might be influ￾enced by a bias due to a more careful surveillance of
patients with IgG4-related disease or AIP. Thus, future
prospective studies are required to analyse the inci￾dence of cancer in patients with IgG4-related disease
compared to age-, sex-, and risk factor-matched con￾trol subjects.189
Q8.2. How can we distinguish IgG4-related disease and
cancer clinically and radiologically?. Statement 8.2.1:
There are no specific clinical features or blood tests
that can differentiate between IgG4-related disease
and cancer. (GRADE 2B; strong agreement)
Statement 8.2.2. Radiological differentiation
between IgG4-related disease and cancer is challenging.
A few imaging findings may aid in the differential diag￾nosis. (GRADE 2C; strong agreement)
Comments: Symptom profiles in IgG4-related dis￾ease and cancer can depend on the organs involved,
but for pancreatic and biliary disease the presentations
are broadly similar. These include weight loss, obstruc￾tive jaundice, abdominal pain, and diarrhoea. There
are no specific clinical features that can differentiate
between IgG4-related disease and cancer.73,84
Involvement of multiple organ systems lends support
for IgG4-related disease. Constitutional symptoms,
including fever and night sweats, are more suggestive
of cancer (e.g. lymphoma) and are rarely present in
IgG4-related disease. Serum IgG4 levels can be elevat￾ed and/or normal in both IgG4-related disease and
cancer. Mild elevations (<2 times upper limit) cannot
reliably differentiate the conditions.142 Marked
elevations (4 times the upper limit) can differentiate
between IgG4-related cholangitis and cholangiocarci￾noma with high specificity,6 although cancers with
IgG4þ infiltrates and elevated serum IgG4 are
described. Tumour markers, such as CA 19-9, can be
elevated in both conditions, especially in the context of
an obstructed biliary system.
The most challenging radiological diagnosis is dif￾ferentiating between focal AIP and pancreatic cancer,
and isolated IgG4-SC (type IV) and extrahepatic chol￾angiocarcinoma, respectively. The combination of a
few MR/CT features may be useful (Table 1).41,190–193
PET/CT may identify a diffuse uptake in the pancreas
in focal AIP and show evidence of other organ involve￾ment.41,190 The role of imaging in the differentiation
between IgG4-related lymphadenopathy and IgG4-
related retroperitoneal fibrosis (RPF) from malignancy
(e.g. lymphoma or retroperitoneal malignancies) has
been poorly investigated and is still unclear. A biopsy
and clonality assessment are often required to clarify
the diagnosis and may still be inconclusive.
Q8.3. How can we distinguish IgG4-related disease and
cancer histologically?. Consensus Statement on the
Pathology of IgG4-RD (histological Boston criteria):
Includes three key morphological features: dense
lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate, fibrosis that is at least
focally storiform, and obliterative phlebitis.
Additional morphological features: phlebitis and
increased eosinophils. The number of IgG4-positive
plasma cells are measured as the mean IgG4þ plasma
cell count per HPF within the three HPFs containing
the greatest number of these cells when the distribution
is patchy. If the IgG4-positive plasma cells are

distributed diffusely, the mean IgG4þ plasma cell
count is determined in three random HPFs.
Histologically highly suggestive of IgG4-related dis￾ease: Two or more key morphological features and
immunohistochemistry demonstrating IgG4-positive
plasma cells above 30–100 per HPF (organ-specific
cut-off in resection specimen) or 10–200 per HPF
(organ-specific cut-off in a biopsy specimen) and
IgG4/IgG plasma cell ratio of over 40%.
Probable histological features of IgG4-related dis￾ease: One key morphological feature and immunohis￾tochemistry demonstrating IgG4-positive plasma cells
above 30–100 per HPF (organ-specific cut-off in resec￾tion specimen) or 10–200 per HPF (organ-specific cut￾off in a biopsy specimen) and IgG4/IgG plasma cell
ratio of over 40%.
Statement 8.3.1: In resection specimens, there are
established histological criteria to distinguish cancer
and IgG4-related disease (the so-called Boston criteria:
three morphological features of lymphoplasmacytic
infiltrate, storiform fibrosis, obliterative phlebitis, and
in addition, immunohistochemistry demonstrating
IgG4-positive plasma cells above 50–100 per HPF
(organ-specific cut-off) and IgG4/IgG ratios of over
40%). (GRADE 2B; strong agreement)
Statement 8.3.2. In biopsy specimens, distinguishing
IgG4-related disease and cancer is more challenging.
Risk of sampling error should be considered in a neg￾ative biopsy. Non-specific inflammation, with increased
IgG4-positive cells can occur in both cancer and IgG4-
related disease. (GRADE 2C; strong agreement)
Statement 8.3.3. An increased frequency of synchro￾nous or metachronous lymphomas and IgG4-related
disease has been reported. Immunohistochemical,
flow cytometric, and molecular studies may help to dif￾ferentiate them. (GRADE 2C; strong agreement)
Comments: In resection specimens from the pancre￾as, liver, or extrahepatic bile ducts, the histological dif￾ferential diagnosis of IgG4-related disease from cancer
is generally easy. However, in histological biopsy speci￾mens this differentiation is often challenging and
depends on the representativeness and the size of the
biopsy material available. If two or three ‘Boston cri￾teria’ for the histological diagnosis of IgG4-related dis￾ease are present with increased IgG4-positive plasma
cells and increased ratio of IgG4- to IgG-positive
cells, a histological diagnosis of IgG4-related disease
is highly suggestive.24,30 However, synchronous pres￾ence of IgG4-related disease and cancer is reported,
requiring careful clinical and radiological correla￾tion.84,182,184 EUS-guided fine needle aspiration
(FNA) from adenocarcinomas of the pancreas or
hepatic bile ducts have a sensitivity and specificity of
75–90% and almost 100% for the diagnosis of malig￾nancy, but are not sufficient for a diagnosis of
IgG4-related disease when only cytological material is
obtained, as the architectural changes characteristic of
this disease cannot be appreciated. However, some￾times pancreatic FNAs may contain small tissue
(micro)-fragments, and EUS-guided FNA with
22-gauge (22G) needles has been used for the diagnosis
of AIP with varying results, mainly in South-East
Asia.44,194–196 EUS-guided fine needle biopsy is pre￾ferred for tissue differential diagnosis between focal
benign and malignant lesions in the pancreas,197–199
where certain histological changes characteristic of
AIP are appreciated, although these can be patchy in
distribution (e.g. lymphoplasmacytic infiltration, focal
storiform fibrosis, obliterative phlebitis), and where
IgG and IgG4 immunostaining for plasma cells can
be performed. Diagnostic difficulties arise when only
one of the Boston criteria or unspecific inflammation
is present, with or without increased IgG4-positive
cells. Peri-tumoural inflammation may show lympho￾plasmacytic inflammation and increased IgG4-positive
cells. Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms have
been associated with IgG4-related disease.44
Distinguishing IgG4-related disease from lymphoma
is challenging. Immunohistochemistry for kappa and
lambda Ig light chains, polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) for immunoglobulin heavy chain (IGH) gene
rearrangement, flow cytometric, and molecular studies
may be necessary. A few studies indicate that patients
with IgG4-related disease have an increased frequency
of synchronous or metachronous lymphomas.184,200 In
the end, a small number of pancreatic resections due to
suspicious of malignancy needs to be accepted in light
of the dire differential diagnosis.
Q8.4. Is IgG4-related disease a paraneoplastic condi￾tion?. Statement 8.4.1: Malignancy in patients with
IgG4-related disease, and particularly AIP, is most
often identified in organs distinct from those affected
by the disease. (GRADE 2B; strong agreement)
Statement 8.4.2: IgG4 antibodies can be found in
both the context of IgG4-related disease and in several
patients with cancer. Further studies are needed to
establish the relationship between IgG4 antibodies,
IgG4-related disease, and cancer. (GRADE 2C;
strong agreement)
Comments: It is well established that long-standing
chronic inflammation plays a critical role in the devel￾opment of cancer through the process of inflammation￾associated carcinogenesis.201 However, the presence of
AIP is more closely associated with extra-pancreatic
cancer than pancreatic cancer itself.84,180,181,185–187
The majority of cancer cases detected in AIP occur at
or within a year of diagnosis.183 Remission of AIP has
also been achieved after the successful treatment of co￾existing cancer,185 as in the case of other autoimmune
Lohr et al. € 653

paraneoplastic disorders. K-ras gene mutations
have been detected in the gastrointestinal tract in
patients with AIP.202 Prospective matched controlled
studies of cancer incidence are required to evaluate
this further.
Cancer and pancreatic tissues of AIP patients with
cancer share key immune responses leading to the
enhancement of IgG4 antibody production.185 IgG4
antibodies may be specifically generated in response
to malignant disease and represent a mechanism of
tumour-induced immune escape. In human melanoma
patients,203 tumour-associated B cells are stimulated by
a Th2 (IL-10 secreting) tumour microenvironment and
polarized to produce IgG4. Strikingly, IgG4 antibodies
can inhibit the anti-tumour effector functions of IgG1
antibodies, and IgG4 serum levels are associated with
decreased patient survival.203 IgG4 responses have also
been reported in other cancers, including extrahepatic
cholangiocarcinoma, pancreatic cancer, and glioblasto￾ma, and elevated serum IgG4 levels have been associ￾ated with poorer prognosis in malignant melanoma
and biliary tract cancers.
WP 9: Systemic treatment of IgG4-related
digestive disease
Q9.1 What are indications and modalities of initial
systemic treatment of IgG4-related gastrointestinal dis￾eases?. Statement 9.1.1: All symptomatic patients
(e.g. suffering from pancreatic pain, obstructive jaun￾dice) should be considered for treatment, sometimes
urgently in cases of organ insufficiency. Treatment
can also be proposed to asymptomatic patients in
case of: (1) persistence of a pancreatic mass in imaging
to rule out cancer, (2) persistence of liver test abnor￾malities (cholestasis) in case of associated IgG4-related
cholangitis, and (3) in subclinical situations that
could lead to severe or irreversible organ failure.
(GRADE 1C)
Statement 9.1.2: There is no relevant data to support
that a treatment should be proposed in patients with
AIP without symptoms, just to limit the risk of exo￾crine or endocrine insufficiencies. (GRADE 1C)
Statement 9.1.3: Treatment with glucocorticoids
should be initiated in a weight-based manner at a
dose of 0.6–0.8 mg/kg body weight/day orally (typical
starting dose 30–40 mg/day prednisone equivalent) for
1 month to induce remission. Response to initial treat￾ment should be assessed at week 2–4 with clinical, bio￾chemical, and morphological markers. Glucocorticoid
therapy should gradually be tapered by 5 mg every two
weeks (tapering duration 3–6 months). (GRADE 1C)
Comments: Indications for treatment of symptom￾atic patients: obstructive jaundice, abdominal pain,
pancreatic pain, and involvement of extra-pancreatic
digestive organs including IRC. In the literature, 10–
25% of patients with IgG4-related disease present
spontaneous resolution of symptoms without medical
(glucocorticoids or immunosuppressive therapy), inter￾ventional endoscopic, or surgical treatment.13,14,204 A
wait-and-see attitude therefore seems to be appropriate
for a significant portion of patients.205 Data on the
long-term functional outcome of gastrointestinal
IgG4-related disease manifestations are limited, espe￾cially in cases of asymptomatic patients. Diabetes mel￾litus has been reported in 19–67% of these patients and
exocrine insufficiency in 36–85%. The wide range of
results might be due to small populations, short
follow-up, and non-standardized criteria for endocrine
and exocrine insufficiencies.34,206 Moreover one surviv￾al analysis did not assess any significant difference
between patients with IgG4-related disease and the
general population. Specific survival rates were 91%
and 72% at 5 and 10 years, respectively.34 The aim of
the treatment is to suppress inflammation, delay fibrot￾ic progression, and prevent disease-related complica￾tions by maintaining the disease in a quiescent state.
Glucocorticoids remain the most effective initial
treatment, although there are limited clinical trials on
the effectiveness of glucocorticoid maintenance thera￾py.14,16 Glucocorticoids are the preferred first-line med￾ication for active IgG4-related disease, with response
rates around 97–100% and a significant decrease of
serum IgG4 levels.14 Treatment with glucocorticoids
should be initiated weight-based at a dose of 0.6–0.8
mg/kg body weight/day orally for 1 month to induce
remission, but initial glucocorticoid dose can be adjust￾ed. This adjustment must be based on body weight, in
case of particularly aggressive disease (use initial dos￾ages above 40 mg/d), or in case of elderly patients, with
very mild clinical symptoms (use <20 mg/d). In
patients with diabetes, it is important to optimize dia￾betic control and osteoporosis medication prior to ini￾tiation of glucocorticoids, if this is possible. A few data
on remission rates using low glucocorticoid doses (e.g.
equivalent prednisolone dosing of 10–20 mg/day) are
available,14,16 but are too preliminary to be proposed.
Response to glucocorticoids has become part of the
diagnostic criteria.1 This suggests that biliary stenting
is not mandatory in combination with glucocorticoids
in cases of obstructive jaundice to limit the risk of chol￾angitis.1 Jaundice totally resolved in less than 15 days
with glucocorticoids (without stenting) with a rapid
normalization of serum liver tests. Biliary stenting
may even propagate pancreatic stone formation in
IRC and AIP.207 As shown by Yukutake et al.,
serum liver test abnormalities are normalized in 80%
and 100% at 15 and 21 days, respectively.208–210
Despite the effectiveness of glucocorticoids, about
one-third of patients experience disease relapse during
654 United European Gastroenterology Journal 8(6)

glucocorticoid tapering, thus requiring re-induction
therapy.14 This re-induction is generally managed
with an increase in glucocorticoid dosing followed by
a prolonged taper. Relapse may occur in the same
organ being treated or, interestingly, in previously
uninvolved organ systems.14,75 Recurrence occurs
more often in patients without prior glucocorticoid
therapy (about 40%) than in cases after previous glu￾cocorticoid therapy (about 25%).14 In the Asian
region, especially in Japan and China, a 12-month
maintenance therapy is therefore recommended. To
be weighed against this are potential side effects of
long-term glucocorticoid maintenance therapy against
the recurrence rate (about 5% with maintenance ther￾apy versus 22% without maintenance therapy).211 No
relevant data are available to recommend maintaining
low-dose therapy for a few months. But several experts
recommend maintaining glucocorticoids at 10 mg/
day (equivalent to 2.5–10 mg/day prednisolone) for
12 months. Some Japanese centres continue low-dose
(5 mg) prednisolone for as many as 3 years212 and
beyond.213
Q9.2. What are the indications for immunosuppressant
treatments for IgG4-related gastrointestinal disease?.
Statement 9.2: Adding immunosuppressive agents
should be considered in case of disease relapse as main￾tenance of remission strategy, and in patients with a
high risk of disease relapse, particularly in the case of
multi-organ involvement. If there is no change in dis￾ease activity or the disease relapsed during the 3
months of treatment (during glucocorticoid taper or
discontinuation), then immunosuppressive drugs
should be added. (GRADE 2C)
Comments: The use of immunosuppressants is still
controversial as a combination therapy along with glu￾cocorticoids as the initial treatment of IgG4-related dis￾ease.14 The remission-induction stage is defined as
fulfilling each of the following criteria after 6 months
of treatment: (1) 50% decline in IgG4 levels;204 (2)
glucocorticoids tapered to maintenance dose
10 mg/day; and (3) no14 relapse during glucocorticoid
tapering within 6 months. Taken together, IgG4-
related disease is sensitive to glucocorticoid therapy,
but the best way to maintain remission remains
unclear. In addition, glucocorticoid monotherapy
might not be sufficient to control IgG4-related disease,
and some patients may relapse during glucocorticoid
tapering. The relapse rate is high and ranges from
26% to more than 70%.13 A Japanese study showed
that maintenance of low-dose glucocorticoids in the
long term (2.5–7.5 mg/day for 3 years) could reduce
the risk of relapse from 58% to 23%.211 However,
the risk induced by long-term glucocorticoid therapy
warrants reconsideration of this option. The risk
factors for relapse are not well understood. However,
several predictors of relapse may be high serum IgG4
levels, persistently high serum IgG4 levels after gluco￾corticoid treatment, and multiple organ involvement.
Furthermore, to avoid long-term side effects of gluco￾corticoid therapy, conventional glucocorticoid-sparing
agents, including azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine,
mycophenolate mofetil, cyclosporine A, tacrolimus,
methotrexate, cyclophosphamide, or rituximab, must
be considered. At least three treatment regimens have
been used for relapse therapy: (a) high-dose glucocorti￾coids followed by maintenance treatment with low￾dose glucocorticoids or a glucocorticoid-sparing
agent; (b) high-dose glucocorticoids without mainte￾nance treatment; or (c) rituximab induction with or
without maintenance rituximab. As glucocorticoids
remain highly successful for re-induction of remission
(>95%), it is reasonable, if tolerated by the patient, to
repeat a course of high-dose glucocorticoids.
Q9.3. Which immunosuppressant (for which patient)
should be proposed as treatment of IgG4-related diges￾tive disease and what are the secondary effects of the
systemic treatment?. Statement 9.3.1: Rituximab
should be considered if patients are resistant or intol￾erant to high-dose glucocorticoids to maintain remis￾sion or have failed to respond to immunosuppressive
therapies. Dosing protocol (375 mg/m2 body surface
area) is used weekly for 4 weeks, followed by infusions
every 2–3 months or at two 1000 mg infusions 15 days
apart every 6 months. (GRADE 2A)
Comments: There is a strong pathophysiological
rationale for rituximab use in IgG4-related disease,
allowing depletion of the CD20 þ B-cell precursors of
disease-specific clonal plasmablasts. Depletion of B
cells by rituximab has been demonstrated to be highly
effective at inducing and maintaining remission. Apart
from glucocorticoids, rituximab is the only drug that
has been shown to induce remission of IgG4-related
disease. It has shown promise in treating patients
with IgG4-related disease in a prospective open-label
study of 30 patients, which revealed a 97% response
rate with significant reduction in patients’ baseline
IgG4-RD RI. A clinical response usually occurs
within 4 weeks of rituximab therapy.15,214,215
In IgG4-related digestive disease, rituximab proved
effective when administered both at 375 mg/m2 weekly
for 4 weeks followed by maintenance infusions every 2–
3 months (onco-haematological protocol) or at two
1000 mg infusions 15 days apart every 6 months
(immunological/rheumatoid arthritis protocol).216
Maintenance therapy with rituximab, continued for
up to 2 years, was associated with longer relapse-free
survival. Adverse events, such as infusion reactions,
hypogammaglobulinemia, and severe infections must
Lohr et al. € 655

be noted. Rituximab presents several advantages, such
as a glucocorticoid-sparing effect, existing data on
remission induction, and (possibly) better safety profile
than glucocorticoids or immunosuppressants.
Statement 9.3.2: Immunosuppressive drugs.
Immunosuppressants used include: thiopurines (azathi￾oprine and 6-mercaptopurine), mycophenolate mofetil,
methotrexate, or calcineurin inhibitors (tacrolimus and
cyclosporine A). (GRADE 2A)15,217–219
Comments: Treatment with thiopurines (azathio￾prine and 6-mercaptopurine). Although data to
support the use of one agent over another are limited,
azathioprine use (2–2.5 mg/kg body weight) is sug￾gested.15 According to a recent meta-analysis, azathio￾prine was used in 85% of cases, with the next common
therapy being mycophenolate mofetil (MMF). Many
patients have been reported to relapse on low doses
of azathioprine (50 mg daily). Therefore, a target
dose of 2–2.5 mg/kg body weight should be sought
under close clinical and laboratory control.
Reportedly, the disease has been controlled by increas￾ing the dose, but upon evaluation of the case series
most responses were achieved in combination with glu￾cocorticoid therapy, making it difficult to assess their
efficacy.90 In few cases, azathioprine and 6-mercapto￾purine (6-MP) may cause myelosuppression, toxic hep￾atitis, or pancreatitis, which requires a switch to a
different immunosuppressant. Many side effects (well￾known in patients with inflammatory bowel disease)
are reported. In the French prospective cohort of
patients with inflammatory bowel disease, a risk of
lymphoproliferative disease when taking thiopurines
was evaluated at 5.28 (2.01–13.9), especially in men
over 65, which is the profile of patients with IgG4-
related disease.220
Therapy with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF). A
recent Chinese randomized control trial showed that
maintenance therapy with mycophenolate, in addition
to glucocorticoids, reduced the risk of relapse (21% at
12 months) compared with glucocorticoids alone
(40%), with no increase in adverse events.221 Therapy
with MMF should commence with 1 g/day and can be
increased to 1.5–2 g/day under close monitoring of
complete blood count. Like azathioprine, many
patients have been reported to relapse on low doses
of MMF (1 g daily).
Therapy with methotrexate (MTX). Several series of
cases reported the role of MTX in patients with relaps￾ing IgG4-related disease .219 In 10 patients, oral or sub￾cutaneous MTX was introduced on average 5 weeks
(range 1–16) after initiation of oral glucocorticoids, at
a mean daily prednisone dose of 20.8 mg (range 10–50).
MTX administration began at a dose of 10 mg/week
and increased to 20 mg/week. Twelve months after
introduction of MTX, six patients were in disease
remission and four maintained partial remission on a
mean daily prednisone dose of 2 mg. In a second series,
three patients were treated by MTX: one maintained
remission at 34 months and two relapsed on MTX at
24 months.218,219
Other immunosuppressants. Calcineurin inhibitors
(CNI), such as tacrolimus or cyclosporine A, can be
used as a steroid-sparing regime in IgG4-related disease
patients with contraindications or non-response to
other therapies. A target level of 5–7 ng/ml for tacro￾limus and one of 80–120 ng/ml for cyclosporine A is
documented in the available case reports. There is little
evidence for the efficacy of CNI as steroid-sparing
agents in IgG4-related disease. One should take into
consideration that long-term use of CNI might lead
to hypertension or renal insufficiency in older patients.
Cyclophosphamide use has been adapted from the
treatment of vasculitis, lupus, and rheumatoid diseases,
and administered as an intravenous infusion or tablets
50–100 mg/day, and often for extra-pancreatobiliary
disease manifestations. A Chinese controlled trial sug￾gested that cyclophosphamide, in addition to glucocor￾ticoids, lowered the risk of disease relapse (12% at 12
months) compared with glucocorticoids alone (39%),
which was, however, associated with increased
toxicity.222
Immunosuppressants display distinctly greater tox￾icity profiles, accompanied with frequent relapses when
used as monotherapy. Too little is known regarding
this subject to confidently suggest monotherapy with
immunosuppressive agents.
As there has been no randomized controlled study
on the treatment of IgG4-related disease, including var￾ious drugs, the best evidence-based treatment of this
disorder is still unknown. The choice of using certain
medication for treatment of IgG4-related disease varies
in different countries, among specialties, and different
organ involvement. Therefore, multicentre clinical
trials with large numbers of patients are needed to
define optimal treatment protocols in IgG4-related
disease.
Areas of uncertainty and future research
These UEG guidelines set out to provide a rational
basis for diagnosing and treating IgG4-related digestive
disease. We achieved this goal, however, inherent to a
relatively rare disease, there are still several white spots
on the map of the digestive tract in conjunction with
this enigmatic disease. Consequently, for several areas,
evidence is low or possibly non-existent, even if experts
agree on a certain practice. Much of this is performed
in analogy to other diseases, such as the consideration
to treat IRC with ursodeoxycholic acid, as done in
other cholangiopathies, such as PBC or PSC.
656 United European Gastroenterology Journal 8(6)

Consequently, as is the case with many other guide￾lines, areas of future research were identified to provide
evidence for future versions. The major topics are the
following:
• incidence of cancer in patients with IgG4-related
digestive disease compared with age-, sex- and risk
factor-matched control subjects, and any risk factors
for its development should be explored in prospec￾tive studies.
• prospective studies to evaluate the accuracy of imag￾ing modalities (CT, MR, PET-CT) even with the aid
of innovative post-processing methods (i.e.
Radiomics, Texture Analysis) in the differentiation
of focal autoimmune pancreatitis and isolated IRC
from pancreatic cancer and cholangiocarcinoma,
respectively.223
• as there have been no randomized controlled studies
on the treatment of IgG4-related digestive disease,
the best evidence-based treatment of this disorder is
still unknown. The use of certain medications for
treatment of IgG4-related digestive disease varies
in different countries, among different specialties,
and different organ involvement; therefore, multi￾centre clinical trials with large numbers of patients
are needed to define optimal treatment protocols.224
• IgG4-related digestive disease in children is very
rare, and multicentre paediatric studies are necessary
for better understanding of the disease course in
children, and to define the best treatment choice.
