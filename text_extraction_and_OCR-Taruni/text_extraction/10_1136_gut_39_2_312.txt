Occupationally related angiosarcoma of the liver
in the United Kingdom 1972-1994
F I Lee, P M Smith, B Bennett, D MJ Williams
Abstract
Background-Angiosarcoma of the liver
(ASL) has been described in vinyl chloride
workers worldwide.
Aim-To describe the UK experience of
occupationally related ASL.
Patients-Twenty patients who died from
ASL after exposure to vinyl chloride.
Methods-The case records and patho￾logical findings of these 20 patients were
reviewed.
Results-Twenty men in the United
Kingdom aged 37 to 71 years have devel￾oped ASL in association with occupational
exposure to vinyl chloride monomer VCM
in two factories. All had been exposed to
VCM for three to 29 years, the tumour
developing nine to 35 years after first
exposure. Presenting clinical features
included abdominal pain, malaise, jaun￾dice, ascites, and massive hepatomegaly.
In most cases the disease progressed
rapidly, death occurring within a few
weeks from hepatic coma. In 17 cases
there was no spread outside the liver. In
four cases there had been haemorrhage
from oesophageal varices due to non￾cirrhotic portal fibrosis diagnosed six to
18 years previously. At necropsy the
livers of these men showed considerable,
often massive, replacement by tumour,
apparently multifocal, with necrosis and
haemorrhage.
Conclusions-In view of the long latency
between exposure and development of the
tumour the full extent of ASL occurrence
may not be known until 35 years after the
introduction of the Code of Practice in
1975.

Background and Methods
Vinyl chloride monomer (VCM) was first
used in the United Kingdom in the manufac￾ture of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) at ICI
Hillhouse in 1940 and at a factory in Barry,
operated from 1948 to 1968 by The Distillers'
Company, and from then until 1982 by BP
Chemicals. VCM had been synthesised by
Regnault in 1835 but had a delayed introduc￾tion into the chemical industry. It was first
used to make rubber substitutes in Germany
(1914-1918) but it was not until the 1930s
that techniques were devised to polymerise
VCM into stable forms of PVC. It was
originally thought to be harmless and was
developed as a possible general anaesthetic
but was never used following the finding of
cardiac arrhythmias in dogs. 1 A Russian paper
describing enlarged tender livers in men who
worked with mature and plasticised PVC is
much quoted in the context of VCM toxicity
but is probably irrelevant.2 In 1963 Suciu3
described Raynaud's phenomenon and
hepatomegaly in workers in a PVC produc￾tion plant in Rumania and in 1966-1967 there
were reports of a syndrome characterised by
acro-osteolysis, Raynaud's syndrome, dermal
induration, and bone lesions in PVC auto￾clave cleaners from Belgium,4 Britain,5 and in
the United States.6 Following these findings
changes were made in the production process
and industrially related acro-osteolysis was
eliminated. A series of experiments was sub￾sequently set up with rats.7 8 Tumours were
demonstrated at various sites after high level
exposure. For the first time it was suggested
that VCM was an animal carcinogen. In a
separate and more comprehensive set of
experiments, it was shown that VCM was
indeed carcinogenic in animals and that, in
particular, angiosarcoma of the liver (ASL)
occurred at a range of inhaled concentrations
down to 50 parts per million (ppm).9
Following recommendations that workers in
the industry should be carefully assessed, the
observation was made that some workers
exposed to vinyl chloride had pronounced
changes in the liver including fibrosis.10 l
The scene was therefore set for the finding in
1974 that three workers involved in the
manufacture of PVC had died from ASL in
Louisville, Kentucky.12 The occurrence of
three of these very rare tumours in the same
factory provided strong suggestive evidence of
causative association. Soon afterwards came
reports from the United Kingdom of a retired
PVC worker who had died in 197213 and

nodules had ruptured spontaneously. In 17
cases there was no evidence of metastases at
necropsy. One man had hypercalcaemia with
no metastases. All livers were the site of the
primary ASL. In four cases there was a previ￾ous history of variceal haemorrhage secondary
to non-cirrhotic portal hypertension.
Laboratory findings
Routine haematological and biochemical tests
were carried out on all patients at the time of
presentation. The most common findings were
in the serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and y
glutamyl transferase enzymes (GGT), which
were increased above the normal range in 17 of
20 cases (Table IV). Abnormalities of platelet
count, serum bilirubin, aspartate transaminase
(AST), and albumin occurred in less than 50°/O
of patients. In one man, serum calcium was
raised (case H 11) and this is discussed below.
Radiology
(1) Isotope scans were carried out in six cases.
All showed non-specific findings consisting of
a diffusely abnormal pattern with obvious fill￾ing defects.
(2) Diffuse liver abnormalities and enlarge￾ment were reported in 13 available ultrasound
examinations. All showed liver enlargement
with a severely abnormal pattern and one or
more large lesions within the liver compatible
with malignant tumour.

abdomen showing multifocal hypodense tumour masses in both liver lobes. (b) Foci of
enlargement in the tumour during dynamic contrast. (c) One minute after injection of
contrast. Some parts of the tumour are hyperdense compared with normal liver. (d) Six
minutes after injection, the tumour is now isodense compared with surrounding liver.
(3) Computed tomograms were available in
seven patients. All showed liver enlargement
with a severely abnormal pattern and tumour
masses (Figs 1 and 2).
(4) Hepatic arteriography was carried out in
four patients demonstrating an obvious
tumour circulation in all cases. In two of these
the abnormality was limited to the right lobe.
Radiological findings supported the clinical
diagnosis without providing unequivocal con￾firmation.
Liver biopsy
In only nine cases was an attempt made in life
to confirm the clinical diagnosis histologically.
Five had needle biopsy performed (cases HI,
B4, B5, B9, and B14). In four of these the
hepatic tissue showed clear cut changes of
ASL. In the fifth patient (H 1) there were
minor non-specific inflammatory changes in
the portal tracts but no evidence of tumour.
One man (case B5) suffered a major intra￾peritoneal haemorrhage and died the next day.
Postmortem examination showed the bleeding
to have been from spontaneous rupture of a
large vascular haemorrhagic tumour occupying
most of the right hepatic lobe close to but
separate from the biopsy site (Fig 3). Four men
underwent laparotomy and wedge biopsy to
reduce the likelihood of sampling errors in
needle biopsy material. In three the specimens
were diagnostic of angiosarcoma (H3, H l1,
and B13) but not in case B12. In 1 1 cases no
attempt at a histological diagnosis was made in
life. In most of these the combination of the
occupational history and the clinical picture
led to a presumptive diagnosis of ASL; in these
very ill patients the discomfort and risks of liver
biopsy were not thought to be justified.
In four men a liver biopsy (two needle, two
laparotomy) had been carried out six to 18
years before their terminal illness. All had
presented with evidence of portal hyper￾tension. In each the histological changes were
of non-cirrhotic portal fibrosis. 17
Metastases
In only three of 20 cases had metastases
occurred. One patient died following intra￾cranial haemorrhage from cerebral metastases
(case B8). In one there was spread of tumour
through the diaphragm into the right pleura
(case H16) and in another a large metastasis
was found in the right adrenal gland at
necropsy (case B13).
Non-metastatic manifestation of malignancy
hypercalcaemia
Case H1 1, a 48 year old man, had no
detectable tumour spread but had hyper￾calcaemia at presentation. Initial symptoms
were severe right upper quadrant pain and
lethargy. On examination he had a hard irregu￾lar liver extending 5 cm below the costal
margin. An isotope liver scan showed a large
hepatic tumour, confirmed by a hepatic arteri￾ogram that showed the right hepatic artery

splayed around the tumour with a pathological
peripheral circulation. In later films the con￾trast outlined venous pools. The serum ALP
was 350 IU/1 and the serum calcium was 3.14
mmol/l with a phosphate level of 0.70 mmol/l.
At laparotomy there was a large vascular
tumour in the right lobe of the liver.
Histological examination showed the typical
appearances of angiosarcoma. The patient
received adriamycin 100 mg and cyclo￾phosphamide 1 g intravenously at monthly
intervals. Initially the serum calcium fell to
normal, but after four weeks it had risen to
3.13 mmol/l. Prednisolone 30 mg daily was
given orally but there was little response and
death occurred eight months after diagnosis.
Preceding non-cirrhotic portal hypertension (four
cases)
Four men (B5, B6, HI5, B20) were especially
interesting in that they were shown to have
portal hypertension six to 13 years before the
diagnosis of ASL of the liver was established.
Figure 3: View of right lobe of liver showing spontaneous rupture of angiosarcoma (case
B5).
Patient B5 was found to have thrombo￾cytopoenia during a factory screening pro￾gramme of process workers in 1974.17 Further
investigations showed hypersplenism, presinu￾soidal hypertension, and oesophageal varices.
A needle biopsy of the liver showed slight
portal fibrosis. Five years later in 1979 he had
a large gastrointestinal haemorrhage from
oesophageal varices. This was controlled by
injection sclerotherapy but three months later
ascites and oedema developed. He died after a
liver biopsy and necropsy demonstrated several
small haemorrhagic liver tumours and a large
deposit in the right lobe that had ruptured into
the peritoneum.
A 49 year old man (B6) was found to have
hepatomegaly while being assessed for an
irritant rash in 1969. Further investigation
showed splenomegaly, oesophageal varices, a
patent portal vein at splenic venogram, and a
raised splenic pulp pressure (205 mm of
blood). He was known to have worked in the
production of PVC for eight years from 1963-
1971. In 1970 he had a portacaval shunt
following a haematemesis. The liver looked
pale, nodular, and 'cirrhotic' but operative
liver biopsy showed non-cirrhotic fibrosis. In
1980 he was admitted to hospital with hepatic
precoma. He improved initially but lapsed
into a coma. Gastroscopy showed insignifi￾cant varices, a large volume of blood in the
stomach, and a duodenal ulcer. Three round
areas in the posterior part of the right hepatic
lobe had the appearance of malignant deposits.
He died a few days later in hepatic coma. At
postmortem examination the death was
attributed to bronchopneumonia. The liver
was small (1130 g) and fibrotic. There were
several tumours one of which was haemor￾rhagic. Many of the tumours were well differ￾entiated but elsewhere there were areas of ASL
with a great variety of liver cell lesions.
Case H15 presented in 1974, aged 52 years,
with oedema and ascites. He was known to
have worked in the PVC industry since 1963.
There were minor changes in the liver function
tests and a low serum albumin (28 g/l). He
declined further investigations. One year later
he presented with massive upper gastrointesti￾nal bleeding from large oesophageal varices,
and a high splenic pulp pressure (32 mm Hg)
was found. A portacaval shunt was performed
but further bleeding occurred after a month
and a lienorenal shunt was carried out. A liver
biopsy showed capsular, portal, and interlobu￾lar fibrosis but no cirrhosis. There were no
further episodes of bleeding but he had con￾tinuing ascites and recurrent portal-systemic
encephalopathy. In 1988 he was admitted with
severe abdominal pain and a raised serum
amylase (>2000 U/1) compatible with the
diagnosis of acute pancreatitis. Hepatic
enlargement was noted and an ultrasound
examination was reported as showing diffuse
changes in the liver suggestive of malignancy.
He deteriorated with increasing abdominal
pain and ascites. He lapsed into hepatic coma
and died. At necropsy the liver was not
enlarged (1450 g) with a coarse nodular
appearance. There were areas of haemorrhagic

tumour in both lobes identified as ASL histo￾logically.
Another man (case B20) was exposed to
VCM from 1965-1974. As part of
a screening
programme in 1974 he was found to have
a low
platelet count (61
X 109/1). Investigation
showed him to have splenomegaly,
a raised
splenic pulp pressure (29 mm Hg), and
oesophageal varices. Liver biopsy showed non￾cirrhotic portal fibrosis. In 1982 he had
melaena and underwent
a course of injection
sclerotherapy and again in 1991 when
a small
varix was found. He re-presented in 1992 with
abdominal pain, diarrhoea, and ankle swelling.
Biochemical tests showed: serum bilirubin 71
,umol/l, ALP 176 IU/1. Ultrasound and com￾puted tomography showed splenomegaly and a
severely abnormal liver suggestive of ASL. He
responded briefly to treatment but he died
after three months. At postmortem examina￾tion the liver weighed 3970 g and was almost
completely replaced by
a haemorrhagic ASL.
The spleen was large (980 g) and there were
numerous varices surrounding the lower
oesophagus although the submucosal varices
had all been obliterated by sclerotherapy.
Discussion
Seven factories producing PVC have been set
up in the United Kingdom, but in only two, BP
Barry (1
5 cases) and ICI Hillhouse (five cases),
have cases of ASL occurred, between 1972 and
1992 (Fig 4). The extreme rarity of this
tumour made it easier to recognise the relation
to VCM exposure. It has been calculated that
the background level of ASL incidence in
the UK is between two and seven cases per
year. 18 This does not include cases attributable
to VCM exposure to Thorotrast, the other
established aetiological agent.'9
In the older plants VCM exposure levels
were high, but since 1975 operators have been
exposed to low levels of VCM. Modem plants
are situated in the open air with no confine￾ment within buildings. All chemicals made and
used are totally enclosed within the plant and
escape of chemicals into the air has for
a long
time been small, except when equipment
failure occurs. The polymerisation process is
carried out in large autoclaves at temperatures
between 40 and 80°C under pressure. In
earlier days, autoclaves were 1-25 m3 in size.
Today 40-80 m3 autoclaves are common;
some companies use up to 200 m3 autoclaves.
The empty autoclave is inspected and made
ready for the next batch. In the process of
making PVC, scale formed on the autoclave
wall. Previously this would have been chipped
off manually after every batch by
a worker who
entered the autoclave after it had been purged
with air. Many of the adverse health effects in
the past can be traced to this autoclave clean￾ing process. Workers were exposed to intermit￾tent, intense concentrations of VCM as the
autoclave was opened, when concentrations of
VCM as high as 10 000 ppm may have been
encountered. Improved PVC recipes have
decreased the scale formation, and high
pressure water cleaning the necessity and

frequency of manual cleaning. Autoclave
cleaning is now carried out under very different
conditions from those previously outlined.
Equipment and manufacturing methods have
been changed to give improved ventilation,
sensitive analytical methods have been
elaborated, and low permissible concentrations
have been established with regular monitoring.
The plants are now monitored on
a continuous
basis, using
a Computer Operated Multi-Point
Analyser, which analyses 24 points fixed in the
plant. Further support is given through
personal monitoring on
a weekly basis.
All the people who developed ASL were
exposed to high levels of VCM except one who
worked as
a premix, blowdown, and stripping
operator. This worker had medium exposure,
but this would still have been in the region of
200 ppm. Of the remaining 19 workers, the
principal occupations were; autoclave opera￾tors(1 3) and poly cleaners (1 1). Some men had
done both jobs. Our patients were in contact
with VCM for seven to 31 years, before the
1975 strict Code of Practice was introduced,
and many process workers would have inhaled
concentrations of 1000 ppm on occasions.
There were differences between the two
factories with regard to the age at which ASL
developed and also in the exposure time to
VCM before the diagnosis was made. In
general workers developed the condition after
shorter exposure and at
a younger age at Barry
where the age range was from 37 to 67 years
after an average exposure of 14 years and in
1
0
of these the diagnosis was made at aged 58
years or less. In contrast in the five cases at ICI
Hillhouse the condition developed from aged
48 to 71 years after an average exposure of 21
years, only one case being under 58 years old.
Despite the large number of employees
exposed to high levels of VCM before 1973-74
the tumour developed in
a comparatively small
number of workers.
The diagnosis should be considered in any
past or present VCM worker presenting with
hepatomegaly, abdominal pain, malaise,
ascites or bleeding oesophageal varices. The
tumours are usually large and evident on ultra￾sound or computed tomography. Ultrasound

will show changes suggestive of ASL, and may
also show evidence of portal hypertension. The
technique, however, will not detect non￾cirrhotic portal fibrosis where even a liver
biopsy may be normal.20 Again the computed
tomographic appearances of ASL are non￾specific but are consistent with a vascular
tumour, the differential diagnosis including
benign vascular tumours, other primary malig￾nant tumours such as hepatocellular carci￾noma, and vascular metastases.21 In difficult
cases angiography is helpful,22 showing typical
vascular abnormalities. Histological confirma￾tion was available prior to necropsy in only
seven of 20 cases, in four from material
obtained at needle biopsy and in three from
open liver biopsy at laparotomy. One patient
died after needle biopsy and we would urge
caution with this technique. In one study 16%
of patients bled after needle biopsy.23
Liver damage had been noted in VCM
workers before the recognition of ASL.101
Non-cirrhotic portal fibrosis follows activation
of the presinusoidal lipocytes (Ito cells) by
VCM. It leads to presinusoidal hypertension,
splenomegaly, and bleeding varices, and may
be associated with an inconspicuous portal
fibrosis.20 At the initial time of reporting the
first seven cases, only one had developed
ASL'7 but with the passage of time three more
have developed the tumour, presumably
because of an effect of VCM on the anatomi￾cally adjacent endothelial cell. In two factory
surveys of 48724 and 422 workers25 liver func￾tion tests proved to have no value in detecting
liver disorders, but two employees who were
picked out because of thrombocytopenia due
to portal hypertension and hypersplenism later
went on to develop ASL. We suggest that
patients with non-cirrhotic portal fibrosis
secondary to VCM exposure should undergo
lifelong follow up. Even for workers without
evidence of liver damage, there is a latent
interval of 12-29 years (mean 21) from first
exposure to the development of ASL. Health
surveillance at the present levels of exposure is
not effective in prolonging the life of the work
force from ASL, but does allow workers to
discuss their concerns, reducing stress and
anxiety created by working with a human
carcinogen. After a study of a large number of
workers exposed to VCM in the United States
it was concluded that the current clinical, bio￾chemical, and haematological tests were of
limited value in predicting ASL, but may be of
value in predicting other hepatotoxic effects.26
The pathological findings in patients with
ASL are characteristic. The liver capsule may
be irregularly thickened from fibrosis. Liver
enlargement is usual, often massive, but in a
few cases longstanding fibrotic change may
limit the degree of hepatomegaly. Haemor￾rhagic nodules of varying size are present in the
liver along with non-cirrhotic fibrosis in much
of the tissue not involved with tumour. None
of the patients in this series had cirrhosis. As
indicated above there were four cases of severe
non-cirrhotic portal fibrosis and in addition
one liver showed peliosis (case B2) similar tO
that seen with anabolic steroids. Three basic
histological patterns may be seen in different
parts of the tumour.27 28 The most common is
the sinusoidal pattern in which dilated hepatic
sinusoids are lined with enlarged proliferating
cells with easily recognisable hepatocyte plates;
the second most common is papillary in which
papillary formations of tumour cells are borne
on a core of connective tissue that may include
recognisable surviving hepatocytes containing
inspissated bile pigment. The cavernous
pattern is characterised by large blood filled
spaces surrounded by thick fibrotic cords lined
by tumour cells. The tumours are multicentric
and death occurs in most cases before distant
metastases appear. The cells involved in these
tumours may be difficult to distinguish from
reactive cells or they may be quite unusual
showing irregular, bizarre giant cells forms. A
helpful diagnostic feature is their close relation
to hepatocyte plates and obvious blood filled
spaces. The cells are endothelial in origin as
shown by the presence of factor VIII, an
endothelial cell marker.29 The pathological
features of hepatic angiosarcoma do not indi￾cate the cause of the disease; environmental
causes such as vinyl chloride, arsenic, and
Thorotrast produce the same changes as in
cases with no known aetiological agent.30
Treatment of this tumour is difficult. In one
study3' three of four patients had a transient
response to adriamycin combined with cytoxan
or methotrexate. Liver transplantation is rarely
possible as the tumours are large, multifocal,
and rapidly enlarging at the time of diagnosis.
Transplantation for non-cirrhotic portal hyper￾tension is not warranted as some of these cases
do not develop ASL.
Any method to assess the expected number
of new cases will probably be an imprecise
exercise. In the absence of complete informa￾tion on the people exposed to VCM, projec￾tions may be based on the distribution of cases
that have occurred within different periods of
maximum possible latency.'6 By this method it
has been predicted that a total of 25-27 cases
of ASL may occur at BP Barry and six to seven
at ICI Hillhouse.
