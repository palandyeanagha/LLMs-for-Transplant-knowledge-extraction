BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Incidental positron-emission tomography (PET) uptake in the thyroid
bed represents a diagnostic dilemma. Currently, there is no consensus regarding the significance of
this finding or the most appropriate approach to management. The purpose of this study was to
determine the significance of incidental fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake in the thyroid gland on
[
18F]FDG–positron-emission tomography (FDG-PET/CT) in patients being initially staged for lymphomas
and/or cancers other than of thyroid origin.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted on patients who were incidentally
found to have focal FDG uptake in the thyroid bed on initial staging for cancer. Patient records were
assessed for age, sex, clinical presentation, standard uptake values (SUVmax), on FDG-PET/CT, and CT
findings in those patients undergoing FDG-PET/CT, fine-needle aspiration (FNA) cytology, and surgical
pathologic examination.
RESULTS: Thirty patients were identified with incidental FDG-PET uptake in the thyroid bed from 630
studies performed for evaluation of cancer between March 2004 and June 2006. Complete records
were available for 18 patients (6 men, 12 women). Five (27.8%) of 18 patients with incidental focal
FDG-PET/CT uptake in the thyroid gland demonstrated papillary thyroid carcinoma on final pathologic
findings. The mean and SD of SUVmax was 3.0  1.8 (range, 1.1–7.4) overall, 2.9  1.6 (range, 1.1– 6.8)
in the patients without malignant growth, and 3.4  2.6 (range, 1.1–7.4) in the 5 patients with papillary
thyroid carcinoma. No statistical difference in SUVmax was noted between patients with papillary
thyroid carcinoma and patients with benign pathologic findings (P  .63).
CONCLUSIONS: Incidental FDG-PET uptake in the thyroid gland in patients with cancer of nonthyroidal
origin is associated with a 27.8% risk for well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma; however, there seems
to be no correlation between intensity of FDG uptake and the risk for a malignant process.
The use of functional imaging such as [18F]fluorodeoxyglu￾cose–positron-emission tomography (FDG-PET) has re￾sultedin anincreasein the detection ofincidentallyfound thyroid
lesions. In a recent retrospective study,Choi et al1
found the prev￾alence of incidentally found focal thyroid lesions on FDG￾PET/CT to be 4.0% and the risk for thyroid malignant tumor
associated with these lesions to be 36.7%. Several other retrospec￾tive studies have reported the incidence of incidentally identified
thyroid lesions on FDG-PET to be 1.1% to 4.3%, with a risk for a
malignant process ranging from 14% to 50%.2-7 Although the
incidence of these lesions is increasing, determining the most ap￾propriate management represents a challenge for endocrinolo￾gists and head and neck surgeons. To date, no specific guidelines
exist to define which lesions necessitate surgical management.
Although diffuse thyroid uptake in FDG-PET is believed to be
either a normal variant, chronic thyroiditis, or Graves disease,
focal thyroid lesions have been associated with a high risk for
malignant tumors.1-10 Unfortunately, no definitive studies have
identified specific characteristics that increase the likelihood of a
malignant tumor. Although standard uptake values (SUVmax)
has been introduced to predict malignant potential, investigators
are still divided regarding this issue. Choi et al and others1-5 re￾ported a correlation between an elevated SUVmax value and a
thyroid malignant tumor. However, Kim et al6 did not find any
significant difference in the maximal SUVmax value between be￾nign and malignant thyroid nodules on FDG-PET and suggested
mandatory cytologic diagnosis regardless of the SUVmax.
The purpose of this study was to determine the clinical
significance of incidental FDG-PET/CT uptake in the thyroid
in patients with lymphomas and/or cancers of nonthyroidal
origin and develop a management algorithm on the basis of
the available data.
Materials and Methods
Subjects
Between March 2004 and June 2006, a total of 630 patients were
evaluated at our institution with FDG-PET. The studies were done for
a variety of diagnoses including metastatic work-up for lymphoma,
head and neck cancer, and other nonthyroidal malignant nodules.
None of the studies were performed for suspicion of thyroid disease.
Thirty patients were identified with incidental focal uptake in the
thyroid bed. The complete records were available for retrospective
review in 18 patients. None of the patients included in the study had
any history of thyroid-related disorder, including cancer. Of these 18
patients, 11 had undergone FDG-PET for evaluation of suspected
lymphoma, 3 patients had the FDG-PET study performed as part of
metastatic work-up for a known nonthyroidal malignant process, and

the remaining 4 patients were being evaluated for a variety of condi￾tions including previous gastrointestinal tract malignant tumor, lung
mass, and fatigue. The 18 patients were included in this analysis.
FDG-PET Method
The FDG-PET/CT images were obtained on a Discovery LS integrated
PET/CT system (GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, Wis). The patients had
fasted for at least 4 hours before fluorodeoxyglucose was adminis￾tered. Blood glucose levels were checked before the injection, and if
these levels were lower than 200 mg/dL, the patients received an in￾travenous injection of 10 to 15 mCi/370 –555 MBq of [18F]fluorode￾oxyglucose. PET imaging was obtained 60 minutes after [18F]fluoro￾deoxyglucose administration.
A thyroid “incidentaloma” was defined as focal thyroid uptake
identified incidentally on FDG-PET or FDG-PET/CT study per￾formed to evaluate nonthyroidal disease. FDG uptake in the entire
thyroid gland was defined as a diffuse pattern, whereas uptake in less
than 1 lobe was considered a focal thyroid lesion. All PET images were
qualitatively examined by an expert nuclear radiologist. SUVmax was
calculated according to routine clinical fashion. We performed statis￾tical analysis using a 2-tailed t test, and significance was set at P  .05.
Results
All of the 18 patients (6 men, 12 women) entered in this study
had focal uptake in 1 thyroid lobe (Table). The mean age of the
patients was 42.3 years (age range, 24 –67 years). Patients were
evaluated with either sonography-guided fine-needle aspira￾tion (FNA) biopsy followed by thyroidectomy (6 patients
[33.3%]), or thyroidectomy (12 patients [66.7%]). The deci￾sion to perform an FNA or proceed with a thyroidectomy was
determined after a discussion with the patient regarding the
options of observation with serial evaluation, FNA, and thy￾roidectomy. Sonography-guided FNA biopsy revealed atypi￾cal cytologic features in 4 (66.7%) of 6 patients. After thyroid￾ectomy, 1 patient with atypical cytologic findings had papillary
thyroid carcinoma. Patients who underwent thyroidectomy
without FNA biopsy had benign disease in 8 (66.7%) of 12
cases, and papillary thyroid carcinoma occurred in 4 of 12
cases (Fig 1). Therefore, 5 (27.8%) of 18 patients with inciden￾tal FDG-PET uptake in the thyroid gland demonstrated pap￾illary thyroid carcinoma on final pathologic examination. The
mean and SD of SUVmaxwas 3.0  1.8 (range, 1.1–7.4) overall,
2.9  1.6 (range, 1.1–6.8) in the patients without malignant
tumor, and 3.4  2.6 (range, 1.1–7.4) in the 5 patients with
papillary thyroid carcinoma. Although the mean SUVmax was
slightly higher in the group with papillary thyroid carcinoma
vs the patients with benign pathologic findings, there was no
statistically significant difference (P  .63).
Discussion
The current widespread usage of whole-body FDG-PET and
FDG-PET/CT studies as a screening tool for evaluation of ma￾lignant tumors has resulted in an increase in the detection of
incidentally found thyroid lesions.11 In fact, as this technology
becomes more available, the incidence of thyroid “incidenta￾lomas” will likely continue to increase. This strengthens the
need to identify which of these lesions are at high risk for a
malignant process. Because there is a risk for malignant
growth associated with these lesions, appropriate manage￾ment guidelines and protocols need to be designed to ade￾quately treat patients with focal “incidentalomas” to prevent
undertreatment or unnecessary thyroidectomy.
In our study, incidentalfocal thyroid lesions were identified in
30 of 630 patients, corresponding to a prevalence of 4.8%. This
finding is comparable with what was previously reported in the
literature.1-7 Similar to previous reports,1,2,6,7 we found a high
(27.8%) risk for malignant tumors in patients with incidentally
identified focal FDG-PET uptake in the thyroid gland.
Although differences in SUVmax have been suggested to dis￾tinguish benignfrommalignant disease,many experts do not rely
on these values because of significant overlap between benign and
malignant lesions.1-6 In our patients, the mean SUVmax was 2.9
for the benign lesions and 3.4 for the malignant lesions, without a
statistical difference between these groups (P  .05). This finding
is similar to that of a previous report by Kim et al.6
The risk for malignant disease in any thyroid nodule is in the
range of 4% to 5%,12,13 and nodulesfoundincidentally on carotid
Doppler studies, MR imaging studies, and CT scans carry a sim￾ilar risk for malignant disease.14 Thus, as in other studies, in our

study lesions incidentally found on FDG-PET had at least a 5
times greater risk for malignant tumor than other nodules.
Because there is no defined consensus on the management
for such “incidentalomas” in the literature, a multidisciplinary
treatment algorithm is proposed in our study (Fig 2). If inci￾dental thyroid uptake is found on FDG-PET, the first diagnos￾tic step should be testing thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)
levels followed by ultrasonography. The presence of a nodule
should lead to a sonography-guided FNA. Malignant cells
found on FNA should ultimately lead to a total thyroidectomy,
whereas the treatment of “benign” or “atypical” cells leads to a
more nebulous course. Although some studies have demon￾strated very high accuracy rates of FNA in the diagnosis of
thyroid lesions,15 others have shown substantial false-negative
rates.16,17 All of the malignant lesions detected in our study
were papillary cancer, which generally has a low risk for distant
metastasis. However, aggressive tumors do occur, and tumors
positive for FDG-PET uptake are often the high-grade type of

differentiated thyroid cancer because glucose metabolism is
generally increased in poorly differentiated cancer.18 Given
the high risk for malignant disease in FDG-PET–positive thy￾roid lesions, the possibility of false-negative FNA, and the pos￾sibility of a high-grade lesion, we recommend either serial thy￾roid ultrasound examination with FNA biopsy or surgery for
patients with FDG-PET–positive thyroid nodules. If surgery is
ultimately decided in cases of “benign” or “atypical” cells on
FNA, hemithyroidectomy followed by intraoperative frozen sec￾tion with completion thyroidectomy in cases of malignant find￾ingsshould be offered. Previous studies demonstrating the ac￾curacy of FNA would suggest that FNA is an appropriate initial
step in all patients presenting with suspicious thyroid nodules;
however, given this small sample size, a larger study is neces￾sary to elucidate the role for FNA in this unique patient popula￾tion presenting with incidental focal thyroid FDG-PET uptake.
Conclusions
We found a 27.8% rate of malignant disease associated with
focal incidental thyroid lesions identified on FDG-PET or
FDG-PET/CT in patients being worked up for a malignant
nodule. There was no correlation between SUVmax intensity
and the risk for a malignant lesion. We recommend that pa￾tients with incidentally detected FDG-PET–positive thyroid
nodules be evaluated with TSH and sonography-guided FNA
biopsy per usual protocol, but because of the high rate of ma￾lignant findings in these lesions, most patients should undergo
surgery.
