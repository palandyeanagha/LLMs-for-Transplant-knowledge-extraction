Pancreatic cancer has a dismal prognosis and effective treatment options are limited.
It is projected to be the second most common cause of cancer related mortality in the
United States by 2030 and there is urgent unmet need for novel systemic treatment
options. Immunotherapy with antibodies targeting PD-1, PD-L1, CTLA-4 has not shown
clinical activity in unselected pancreatic cancer, emphasizing the need for combination
immunotherapy approaches or other therapeutic strategies. As such, chimeric antigen
receptor (CAR) T cell therapy represents an emerging therapeutic option for pancreatic
cancer. This modality utilizes genetically engineered T cells that are redirected to specific
cancer-associated antigens to elicit potent cytotoxic activity. This review summarizes
the available preclinical data and highlights early phase clinical trials using CAR T cell
approaches in pancreatic cancer, a disease state that is gaining attention as a conduit
for cell therapy. Future directions in application of CAR T cell therapy are also considered
including its ability to be directed against novel epitopes and combined with other
therapeutic regimens.

INTRODUCTION
Pancreatic cancer is the fourth most common cause of cancer related mortality in the United States,
and estimates project it to become the second most common cause of cancer related mortality
by 2030 (1, 2). Approximately 60% of patients present with advanced disease and median overall
survival ranges between 8.5 and 11.1 months with the current therapeutic approaches (3, 4). The
majority of patients who present with localized disease eventually develop metastasis. Therefore,
development of effective systemic therapies is key in improving the outcomes of patients with
pancreatic cancer. The therapeutic options for systemic therapy are limited and clinical activity is at
best modest. Immunotherapy with checkpoint inhibitors has emerged as a novel therapeutic option
in many solid and hematologic malignancies. However, trials in pancreatic cancer with checkpoint
inhibitors have only shown activity in a small subset of patients with micro-satellite instability of
their cancer, which increases mutation burden and the likelihood of tumors harboring neoantigens.
The limited success of immunotherapy in pancreatic adenocarcinoma is multi-factorial, but
certainly influenced by a notoriously immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) and
lack of tumor-associated neo-antigens to stimulate an immune response in most patients.
Therefore, systemic therapies for pancreatic cancer remain a significant unmet need.
Adoptive cellular therapy using tumor antigen-specific T cells has endured a remarkable
evolution from its roots in the setting of malignant melanoma. The initial development of this

Akce et al. CAR T-Cell Therapy in Pancreatic Cancer
approach was led by Dr. Steven Rosenberg and his colleagues
in the 1980s using TILs isolated from melanoma patients (5–
7). Decades of subsequent translational and clinical research
by many talented investigators led to continued refinement of
adoptive T cell therapy approaches and the critical factors that
can be manipulated to maximize their efficacy. These advances
include a multitude of factors including pre-conditioning
regimens, optimal ex vivo expansion protocols, and co￾administration of cytokines, among many others [Reviewed in
(7, 8)]. Further refinement of antigen specificity was achieved in
the 1990s following the development of gene transfer techniques
that enabled introduction of chimeric antigen receptors (CARs)
into T cells (7, 9, 10).
This review addresses the potential for CAR T cell therapy
in the setting of pancreatic cancer. Herein we summarize
both preclinical and early-phase clinical experience in CAR￾mediated redirection of T cells. Key antigens of relevance to
pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) are discussed, along
with innovative future directions of research occurring in this
rapidly moving field.
CAR-T CELLS REPRESENT A PROMISING
THERAPEUTIC MODALITY
Adoptive transfer of lymphocytes continues to evolve as a
treatment modality for advanced cancer. This general approach
can leverage the versatility of T cells and their ability to be
redirected toward relevant tumor antigens via engineered T
cell receptors (TCRs) or CARs. Redirecting cell specificity via
CARs represents one sophisticated approach that has gained
traction in clinical care of hematologic malignancy. To generate
the appropriate cell therapy product, T cells are collected from
patient peripheral blood by leukapheresis and redirected to
a specific antigen via viral expression of a Chimeric Antigen
Receptor (CAR; Figure 1). To date, this approach has been widely
utilized as an individualized therapy with genetic modification
of autologous T cells from patients, although “off-the-shelf ”
CAR T cell approaches are beginning to emerge using T cells
from allogeneic donors. The CAR constructs, when incorporated
into T cells, mimic TCR activation, and redirect specificity and
effector function toward an intended antigen, with the important
advantage of eliciting recognition in a non-MHC-restricted
manner (11).
The design of CARs continues to evolve, whereby the first￾generation constructs contained an extracellular ligand-binding
domain, such as a single chain variable fragment (scFv) that
is directed toward a specific antigen, along with the CD3ζ or
Fc receptor γ signaling domain (10, 11). Subsequent second
generation or third generation CARs contain one or more
costimulatory domains, respectively such as CD28, 4-1BB, ICOS
or OX40 to selectively modify the function and/or persistence of
the resultant CAR T cells (12–17). For example, inclusion of the
CD28 domain can afford a more rapid expansion of the CAR
T cells, while the 41BB domain is typically used to enhance in
vivo persistence of the cells, albeit at a slower rate of expansion.
These particular domains may also lead to a differential effect
on redirected CD4+ or CD8+ T cell subsets. In a general
sense, the CD28 molecule is recognized to more selectively
promote expansion of naïve and CD4+ T cells, while the 41BB
domain is more relevant to facilitating expansion of memory
and CD8+ T cell subsets (17). Finally, development of antigen￾redirected T cells has already entered the realm of an imaginative
transition to utilizing fourth generation CAR constructs. These
include highly sophisticated engineering that incorporates the
ability of redirected T cells to produce immunomodulatory
cytokines (e.g., IL-12, IL-18, IL-21) or antibodies (e.g., anti-PD￾1), optimize trafficking via expression of chemokine receptors,
and converting immune suppressive signals rich within the
tumor microenvironment into activating signals that further
enhance T cell activity. These and other constructs incorporating
safety-intended suicide switches and receptors conferring bi￾specificity and other signaling domains are in the early phases
of both pre-clinical and clinical testing. These fourth generation
CAR constructs and their application in solid tumors is the
topic of a detailed, informative review by Knochelmann et al.
(15).
Once CAR T cells are generated and undergo clonal expansion
in culture, cells can be infused into patients to achieve antigen￾directed, T cell mediated antitumor immune responses. In
order to maximize in vivo expansion and decrease inhibitory
lymphocytes that may persist systemically, patients are given
a chemotherapy pre-conditioning regimen for lymphodepletion
prior to infusion of CAR T cells (13, 14). Bulk T cell populations
are typically reinfused as a cellular product for yield and logistical
reasons, however the relative ratio of CD4+ vs. CD8+ T cells
that are redirected toward antigen via CAR constructs may
impact both the effector function and persistence of the cells.
This emphasizes the complexity of implementing CAR T cell
therapeutic approaches, and from a biological perspective, the
importance of T cell help in generating effective antitumor
immune responses.
Although dramatic efficacy can be achieved in patients
following CAR T cell therapy, there is a risk for serious adverse
events. In particular, cytokine release syndrome and neurological
toxicity have been observed in patients, and illustrate the
consequences of potent immune recognition of antigenic targets
and the resulting robust immune response. In the context
of pediatric ALL and other disease settings, administration
of antibodies that block the interleukin-6 (IL-6) receptor are
effective for reversal of the cytokine release syndrome (18), and
allow patients to tolerate CAR T cell therapy. A provocative
report by Fraietta et al. further showed that serum IL-6 correlated
with CAR T cell expansion and that IL-6/STAT3 signaling may be
important for proliferation of the redirected T cells in the setting
of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (19). These data highlight
the complexity of cytokine signaling in mediating toxicity and
potential response related to CAR T cell therapy. More recent
pre-clinical studies by Giavridis et al. report that IL-1 blockade
may also be an effective means to control this cytokine release
syndrome secondary to CAR T cell therapy (20). However,
the concerns with neurotoxicity highlight the need for careful
antigen selection, and patient monitoring during the course of
these therapies.

FIGURE 1 | Isolation, engineering, and challenges of CAR T cell therapy in pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC). T cells are collected from peripheral blood of patients
with PDAC via leukapheresis and engineered to express chimeric antigen receptors directed toward a specific tumor antigen. These cells are subsequently expanded
before reinfusion into patients. Significant challenges exist for these cells to infiltrate the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironement of PDAC including the
presence of dense stroma and myofibroblast cells, immunosuppressive cytokines such as IL-6 and TGF-β, and the presence of immunosuppressive immune cell
types such as Th17 cells, MDSCs, and suppressive T-regs.
CLINICAL EFFICACY OF CAR T CELL
THERAPY IN HEMATOLOGIC
MALIGNANCY HAS PROVIDED A FIRM
FOUNDATION FOR GROWTH
A wealth of clinical experience with CAR T cell therapy has been
derived from hematologic malignancy. Clinical efficacy of CAR
T cell therapy was shown when Kochenderfer et al. reported
a partial response with anti-CD19 CAR T cell therapy in a
patient with treatment-refractory stage IVB follicular lymphoma
(21). This was the first reported patient who achieved a clinical
response with anti-CD19 CAR T cell therapy and it lasted 8
months before the patient developed progressive disease. Porter
et al. utilized anti-CD19 CAR T cell therapy in a patient with
refractory CLL and achieved a complete remission 3 weeks
after treatment, which persisted for at least 10 months (22).
CAR T cells persisted for 6 months at high levels in the
peripheral blood and bone marrow. Two other patients treated
with the same regimen achieved clinical response. These early
findings prompted further development of a prospective studies
in hematologic malignancies and produced overall response
rates ranging from 52 to 92%. Complete response rates ranging
from 43 to 90% were reported in subsequent clinical trials with
anti-CD19 CAR T cell therapy in treatment refractory advanced
lymphomas (18, 23–29). The ZUMA-1 and 2 trials, and ongoing
ZUMA-3 and 4 trials reported high and durable response rates
in patients with relapsed refractory large B cell lymphomas
and with relapsed refractory pre-B cell ALL. Additionally, the
phase II ELIANA trial of CTL019 CAR T cell therapy reported
75% relapse free probability at 6 months after remission, 89%
probability of survival at 6 months, and 79% probability of
survival at 12 months in pediatric and young adult patients
with relapsed and refractory ALL (26, 30–33). This clinical trial
provided the foundation for development of Tisagenlecleucel,
CTL019, (Kymriah) which as a result was approved by the FDA
for treatment of relapsed refractory B-cell precursor ALL in
pediatric and young adult patients. This was followed by FDA￾approval of axicabtagene ciloleucel (axi-cel; Yescarta), which
targets CD19 in adult patients with relapsed refractory large B
cell lymphoma after 2 lines of prior therapy (34).
PAVING THE ROAD FOR CAR T CELLS IN
PDAC WITH PRECLINICAL STUDIES
A number of published studies demonstrate efficacy of CAR T cell
therapy platforms in preclinical models of pancreatic cancer. The

results to date are derived from multiple in vivo models, including
transplantable human tumors, patient-derived xenografts, and in
a more limited number of cases, immune competent mice with
spontaneously-arising, or transplanted syngeneic tumors. One
priority for the field remains the need to discover and validate
new, bona-fide pancreatic cancer-specific antigens to minimize
potential on-target, off-tumor adverse events. However, the
existing data with several candidate antigens has infused some
momentum into the field (Figure 2). For example, pre-clinical
work on CAR T cells in pancreatic cancer targeting the
tumor antigen mesothelin subsequently led to human studies.
Mesothelin is a glycoprotein over-expressed on a variety of tumor
cells including pancreatic cancer. This antigen is present on the
cell surface, first as a 69-kDa protein, that later becomes cleaved
via the furin protease into a soluble 32 kDa N-terminal fragment
and a 40-kDa C-terminal fragment that remains membrane
bound (44, 45). From a functional standpoint, data indicate
mesothelin positively regulates tumor growth and invasion. The
protein has relatively limited expression in normal tissue, where
it is localized to mesothelial cells, including cells of the pleura,
pericardium, peritoneum, fallopian tubes, trachea, tonsils, and
cornea where its function is unclear (44, 46–48). One intriguing
observation qualifying its role as an antigen of interest is that
mesothelin-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell reactivity is evident
in patients with pancreatic cancer (48–50). Mesothelin-directed
CAR T cell therapy has been used widely across pre-clinical
models in a variety of malignancies (51–54), including elegant
studies in pancreatic cancer by Beatty et al. whereby T cells were
redirected via mRNA electroporation of mesothelin-targeted
CAR with CD3z and 4-1BB signaling domains to elicit a transient
CAR expression for safety (55).
An assortment of preclinical studies targeting antigens in
preclinical models of PDAC continue to emerge (Figure 2).
Among these are interesting data in which CAR T cells were
redirected against CEA (CEACAM5), a long-standing antigen
FIGURE 2 | Candidate target antigens for CAR T cell therapy in pancreatic
ductal adenocarcinoma. Several target antigens for CAR T cell therapy have
been identified and are being studied in both preclinical and clinical trails.
These antigens are expressed at varying levels on PDAC cells and include
CD24 (35), Prostate stem cell antigen (PSCA) (36), CEA (37), MUC-1 (38),
Mesothelin (39), FAP (40), and Her-2 (41).
of interest for immune response in advanced gastrointestinal
malignancy. The expression profile of CEA has made it a target
for vaccine trials (56, 57). It is expressed in up to 70% of
pancreatic cancers, leading to its potential as a tumor specific
antigenic target. In a murine model of PDAC, CEA-redirected
CAR T cells produced long-term anti-tumor responses with no
evidence of damage to normal tissues with lower levels of CEA
expression (58). Targeting of other tumor antigens including
PSCA, HER2 neu CD24 and MUC1 has also demonstrated
impressive activity in preclinical PDAC models (36, 59–62).
Other innovative approaches for redirecting T cells are in
development as our understanding into the complexity of tumor
antigens in PDAC improves. For example, a recent study by
Posey et al. directly addressed the poor expression of cancer￾specific antigens on the cell surface by developing a CAR
that recognized a Th glycoform of the MUC1 antigen. This
creative work showed CAR T cells redirected against this
aberrantly glycosylated antigen were efficacious in xenograft
models of PDAC and leukemia (62). These data highlight the
potential for re-invigorated antigen discovery when considering
finer structure of proteins and their modifications that can be
preferentially expressed on PDAC cells.
OVERCOMING SUPPRESSIVE
“ROADBLOCKS” FOR EFFECTIVE CAR T
CELL THERAPY IN PANCREATIC CANCER
One notable challenge for CAR T cell therapy in preclinical
models of PDAC is the inherent histologic properties and
FIGURE 3 | Frontiers in CAR T cell therapy for pancreatic ductal
adenocarcinoma. Continuing research within CAR T cell therapy for solid
organ malignancy has opened new methods for engineering T cells including
enhancing intracellular signaling domains (A) to enhance persistence of CAR T
cells within the body as well as efficacy against tumors. (B) Some groups have
designed CARs that recognize multiple antigens within the tumor
microenvironment while maintaining their antitumor activity within the body
(42). (C) There is opportunity to utilize individual phenotypically defined
populations of T cells including CD26 high cells (43).

Akce et al. CAR T-Cell Therapy in Pancreatic Cancer
profound immunosuppressive capacity of this tumor type
(Figure 1). For example, the desmoplastic reaction present in
a majority of pancreatic tumors leads to a dense stroma that
in theory, can serve as a physical barrier for drug delivery and
penetration of endogenous or engineered T effector cells. Various
components of the stroma can also serve as a source of abundant
inhibitory cytokines, including IL-6 (63). In the context of other
cytokines in the tumor microenvironment, such as TGF-β or IL￾10 (42, 64) a cytokine milieu emerges which promotes expansion
and enhanced suppressive function of cells such as T-regs, Th17
and myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC). Together these
soluble and cellular factors can limit the function of any cytotoxic
T cells that may be directed toward tumor antigens.
Overcoming this immunosuppressive microenvironment is a
potential strategy to improve CAR T cell survival, trafficking
and persistence in PDAC, and numerous pre-clinical studies
addressing this concept are underway. For example, heparanase
is under investigation as a means to overcome the physical
barriers of the desmoplastic reaction, and in preclinical studies,
was shown to increase antitumor activity and tumor infiltration
of CAR redirected T lymphocytes (65). To address inefficient
trafficking of CAR T cells into the tumor microenvironment,
several studies have employed targeted approaches redirecting
these cells to prominent cell surface molecules that are of
relevance for pancreatic cancer. For example, the chemokine
receptor CCR2 was successfully transduced into mesoCAR T
cells, which increased T cell infiltration and antitumor activity
compared to conventional mesoCAR T cell administration in
immunodeficient mice with large mesothelin expressing tumors
(66). Likewise, fibroblast activation protein (FAP) has been
leveraged as a potential target antigen in the context of CAR
T cells. This antigen is particularly unique given its expression
on myofibroblast cells present within the pancreatic stroma.
In an eloquent proof of principle study, Tran et al. developed
a novel CAR T cell approach whereby cells were redirected
to interact with FAP, and adoptively transferred in to mouse
models bearing a variety of subcutaneous tumors including
pancreatic adenocarcinoma. This approach was associated with
cachexia and lethal bone toxicity, which most likely would limit
its utilization as a universal target with CAR T cell therapy
(40).
Another principal mediator of immune suppression is
upregulation of immune checkpoint receptors including PD-1 on
the surface of antigen-experienced T cells. Increased expression
of PD-1 is associated with T cell exhaustion, and blocking the
interaction of PD-1 with its ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2 has
shown impressive clinical activity in oncology, leading to FDA￾approval for several antibodies targeting this immunosuppressive
axis (67). Similarly, CAR T cells upon infusion can upregulate
the inhibitory, PD-1 receptor on their surface (68). Similar
to unmanipulated T lymphocytes, PD-1 upregulation on CAR
T cells can signify exhaustion of effector function, limiting
the efficacy of CAR T cell based therapy. These observations
provide rationale to combine CAR T cell therapy with antibodies
targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 axis (69). This concept is being
explored clinically in combination immunotherapy trials, and
in sophisticated, fourth-generation CAR design strategies that
allow for genetic ablation of PD-1 in antigen redirected cells
(70–72) or even production of PD-1/PD-L1-targeted agents
by the modified T cells themselves (73, 74). These advanced
design approaches highlight the adaptability of T cells as a
therapeutic platform and how they can be manipulated to
overcome redundant mechanisms of immune suppression in
cancer.
CLINCIAL EXPERIENCE WITH CAR T
CELLS IN PANCREATIC CANCER
Preliminary results of case reports using CAR T cell therapy in
pancreas and other non-hematologic malignancies encouraged
development of multiple clinical trials in pancreatic cancer with
CAR T cell therapy. Multiple different antigens specific to the
tumor are being targeted in current ongoing clinical trials in non￾hematologic malignancies including pancreas cancer (Table 1).
Several antigens including CEA, HER2, MUC1, CD133, prostate
stem cell antigen (PSCA) and mesothelin are prominent
targets using this approach in pancreatic cancer (Figure 1).
The challenges in developing CAR T cells in non-hematologic
malignancies include lack of cell surface tumor-specific molecules
that could be targeted by genetically engineered CAR T cells
(75). The expression of the targeted antigen in normal and
tumor tissues raises concern regarding potential off target toxicity
(76, 77). Another challenge present clinically is the profound
degree of immunosuppression that limits both the persistence
of CAR T cells and their ability to effectively traffic to the
tumor sites. Lymphodepletion has been shown in prior trials
to enhance expansion, cytokine release, and persistence of the
CAR T cells. Cyclophosphamide alone or in combination with
fludarabine has been utilized in various CAR T cell therapy
trials in hematologic malignancies as preconditioning regimens
in order to achieve lymphodepletion prior to CAR T cell therapy.
The success of CAR T cells depends on their ability to expand ex
vivo while loss of central memory and naïve T cell subsets can
be seen in heavily treated lymphoma patients due to multiple
rounds of cytotoxic chemotherapy. This may also be a factor
of relevance in patients with PDAC who may be candidates
for experimental trials with CAR T cells, as most patients will
have received systemic chemotherapy as standard of care. A
recent report has shown that the quality of patient T cells
could be a variable in the success of CAR T cell manufacturing,
particularly loss of CD27/CD28 expression in heavily pre￾treated lymphoma patients (78). Considering many lines of prior
systemic therapy in non-hematologic malignancies prior to CAR
T cell therapies similar challenges could be encountered in this
area as well.
Data from pre-clinical studies have permitted translation
of CAR T cell therapy into several clinical trials for patients
with pancreatic cancer (Table 1). Largely, target antigens used
in patient trials have overlapped with the pre-clinical studies
leading up to them. To date, the most experience with CAR
T cells in PDAC patients has been gained through targeting
mesothelin. Approximately 80–85% of pancreatic carcinomas
express mesothelin and as a result, it has become a prominent

target for CAR T cell therapy trials (39, 44). At the time
of this review article, 10 separate clinical trials using CAR T
cells directed against mesothelin have been completed or are
in progress. The first results using mesothelin-directed CAR
T cells (CARTmeso cells) were reported by Beatty et al. in
a case report from two patients, one with malignant pleural
mesothelioma (MPM) and a second with pancreatic cancer
(55). In this trial, a major goal was to ensure safety given
potential for expression of target antigens on normal tissues.
To accomplish this, the authors developed a strategy for
transient CAR expression via mRNA electroporation encoding
an anti-mesothelin ss1 scFv CAR. Interestingly, in the patient
with pancreatic cancer, the T cells were obtained from his
monozygotic twin brother, activated, expanded with mRNA
electroporation encoding the CAR. The CARTmeso cells were
administered as eight doses of intravenous infusion followed by
two intratumoral injections for the pancreatic cancer patient.
No lymphodepleting therapy was given to either patient.
Results indicated the CARTmeso transgene was detectable in
peripheral blood in both patients after intravenous CARTmeso
administration at pre-specified time points per the study; in the
ascitic fluid 3 days after the initial intravenous infusion and
13 days after first intratumoral injection in the patient with
pancreatic cancer. CARTmeso transcripts were also detected in
the pre and post-pancreatic tumor biopsy tissue in the patient
with the first intratumoral injection of CARTmeso cells. This
finding indicated CARTmeso cell trafficking into the tumor
tissue indeed occurred following intravenous administration.
The patient with MPM achieved partial response, which lasted
6 months, and the patient with pancreatic cancer achieved stable
disease.
In a more recent phase I study of CARTmeso cells by the same
group, 6 patients with treatment refractory metastatic pancreatic
cancer were administered CARTmeso cells intravenously 3 times
per week for 3 weeks. In this trial, no dose limiting toxicity,
cytokine release syndrome or neurological complications were
encountered, while stable disease was reported in two of the
patients (79). These findings were complemented by decreased
FDG uptake on PET computed tomography, suggestive of
activity against the tumor in these patients. This initial
encouraging safety data with a more conservative, transient
expression approach of CAR targeting mesothelin has prompted
further attempts at targeting this antigen using more stable
introduction of lentiviral constructs into T cells (NCT02159716).
Several other trials are currently open to patients with
mesothelin-expressing PDAC to further evaluate CARs directed
at this antigen (NCT01583686, NCT02465983) (48).
Clinical experience with targeting other antigens via CAR T
cells continues to emerge (Table 1). For example, multiple clinical
trials are underway with CEA-directed CAR T cell therapy
that include patients with pancreatic cancer (NCT02850536,
NCT02349724). However, existing data with targeting CEA
emphasize cautionary discretion is needed in subsequent clinical
studies. In a feasibility study, anti-CEA CAR T cell therapy
resulted in significant respiratory toxicities in patients with
advanced CEACAM5+ gastrointestinal malignancies, including
pancreatic cancer. These results necessitated premature closure

of the study (80). Clinical trials with CAR T cells redirected
against HER2 neu have also gained traction in the setting
of PDAC, yet will proceed with caution given potential for
toxicity. Namely, one clinical study was terminated early, after
the first patient (with colorectal cancer) died as a result of
pulmonary toxicity, cytokine storm, and multiorgan failure
arising following infusion of the HER2 neu targeted CAR T
cells (81). (NCT00924287) Other trials are ongoing in HER2 neu
positive malignancies with CAR T cells redirected against this
antigen (NCT02713984, NCT00889954) that will be informative
once completed for assessment of both safety and potential for
toxicity.
Equipping CAR T cells to engage tumors via specificity
for other antigens in the setting of PDAC will continue to
progress into clinical trials. This is a rapidly moving field that
has extended beyond mesothelin, CEA and HER2 neu and
into additional antigens including PSCA (36, 59, 60), and in
MUC-1 (Table 1), among others. Of paramount importance will
be careful consideration of on-target toxicities and antitumor
efficacy, given the limited experience of adapting CAR T cells into
solid tumor oncology.
While our understanding of CAR T cell-mediated adverse
events remains in its early stages, combination immunotherapy
approaches continue to enter clinical trials at a remarkably rapid
pace (82). This momentum has been influenced by the success
of immune checkpoint blockade, particularly with antibodies
targeting PD-1 and CTLA-4 (67). There is a high level of interest
in the field to develop treatment strategies that administer these
antibodies, which can reverse T cell exhaustion with the antigen￾specificity of CAR T cell therapy. Although a majority of this
work is occurring in hematologic malignancy, its application
to PDAC or other solid tumors is becoming accelerated. Novel
studies are ongoing utilizing autologous CAR T cells redirected
to recognize mesothelin and simultaneously engineered to
express antibodies targeting PD-1 and CTLA-4 for recurrent
and refractory non-hematologic malignancies (NCT03182803,
NCT03030001). Another clinical trial is recruiting patients with
non-hematologic tumors to evaluate the novel combination of
autologous MUC1-redirected CAR T cells engineered to express
antibodies targeting CTLA-4 and PD-1 (NCT03179007). Finally,
sophisticated gene editing technologies such as CRISPR/Cas9
are being utilized to further engineer CAR T cells that lack
genes encoding factors such as PD-1 that mediate an exhausted
phenotype and function (71, 72) or alternatively aid in the design
of universal, “off-the-shelf ” CAR T cell approaches that lack self￾recognition factors (83, 84). Other gene engineering strategies are
also in development which incorporate suicide genes to improve
the safety of these cell therapy strategies so that the therapeutic
effect can be turned on or off, on demand (85).
TIME FOR CUSTOM DESIGN: FUTURE
ADVANCES FOR CAR T CELL THERAPY IN
PANCREATIC CANCER
Further advances in customizing the design of CAR T cells
continues to emerge and may overcome challenges related
to persistence, features of the tumor microenvironment and
optimizing phenotype (Figure 3). Guedan et al. addressed
some of these challenges by studying how specific intracellular
signaling domains (ICDs) such as ICOS or 41BB can be leveraged
to enhance the persistence and effector phenotype, respectively
(14). These data suggest CAR T cells can be customized to
overcome limitations simply by adjusting the ICD of choice.
Likewise, our understanding of the optimal cellular compartment
to use as a “starting point” for generating CAR T cells continues
to mature. While many approaches involve redirecting CD8+ T
cells to take advantage of their effector function by redirecting
mixed CD4+ and CD8+ populations or even more precise
phenotypes such as T cells expressing high levels of the CD26
surface marker (43). These CD26high cells are apparently licensed
with a natural capacity to traffic to and elicit antitumor activity
in solid tumors including PDAC as shown in preclinical models.
Other phenotypically distinct T cell subsets may also be well￾suited for use in the setting of CAR T cell therapy. Other
subsets including tissue-resident, stem-like T cells could also be
considered as candidate cellular templates for CAR-mediated
modification. In particular, a CD8+ T cell subpopulation
expressing CXCR5 and the transcription factor, TCF-1 has been
identified in mice that gives rise to new CD8+ effector cells
from models of chronic LCMV infection and in tumors (86).
In theory, these cells could be adaptable as a platform upon
which to facilitate redirection of antigen specificity and in vivo
expansion. Finally, CAR T cells are being designed that capitalize
upon these abundant immunosuppressive features within the
PDAC microenvironment that in theory can be leveraged as a
switch to engage the full cytotoxic potential of CAR T cells. In
a clever report, Sukumaran et al. rendered T cells responsive
to immunologic features present exclusively at the tumor site
by using a trio of CARs that recognize PSCA, TGF-β, and
IL-4. These cells were capable of transmitting signals needed
for activation, co-stimulation and cytokine support. T cells
redirected via these novel constructs elicited antitumor activity
against PDAC in vivo that was accompanied by T cell expansion
and persistence (42). Other preclinical studies continue to
provide a foundation for combinatorial therapy involving CAR T
cells in PDAC, including combinatorial approaches with innate
immune agonists such as STING (87), oncolytic viruses (88), or
using FITC-labeled, tumor-directed antibodies to increase CAR
T cell recognition (89).
CONCLUSIONS
The impressive results of CAR T cell therapy in hematologic
malignancies and preliminary positive outcomes in non￾hematologic tumors including pancreatic cancer prompted
multiple clinical trials with CAR T cell therapy in this disease
setting. Further understanding of the tumor microenvironment,
improving off target effects of CAR T cell therapy, reasons
of failures with single agent immunotherapy agents, and
incorporation of novel agents in combination with CAR T cell
therapy may help accomplish effective treatment outcomes in
pancreatic cancer. While the extension of CAR T cell therapy

into PDAC is just beginning, the field is moving rapidly, and
embracing innovative technologies to mitigate potential toxicity
and elicit antigen-direct tumor killing.
