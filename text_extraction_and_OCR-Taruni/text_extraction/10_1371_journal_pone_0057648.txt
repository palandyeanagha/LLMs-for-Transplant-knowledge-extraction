Abstract
Ventricular hypertrabeculation/noncompaction is a morphologic and functional anomaly of myocardium characterized by
prominent trabeculae accompanied by deep recessus. Dilated cardiomyopathy with left ventricular failure is observed in
these patients, while the cause or pathophysiologic nature of this complication is not known. Anti-troponin antibodies are
formed against circulating cardiac troponins after an acute coronary event or conditions associated with chronic myocyte
necrosis, such as dilated cardiomyopathy. In present study, we aimed to investigate cardiac troponins and anti troponin
autoantibodies in ventricular noncompaction/hypertrabeculation patients with/without reduced ejection fraction. A total of
50 patients with ventricular noncompaction and 23 healthy volunteers were included in this study. Noncompaction/
hypertrabeculation was diagnosed with two-dimensional echocardiography using appropriate criteria. Depending on
ejection fraction, patients were grouped into noncompaction with preserved EF (LVEF .50%, n = 24) and noncompaction
with reduced EF (LVEF ,35%, n = 26) groups. Troponin I, troponin T, anti-troponin I IgM and anti-troponin T IgM were
measured with sandwich immunoassay method using a commercially available kit. Patients with noncompaction had
significantly higher troponin I (28.9869.21 ng/ml in NCNE group and 28.11610.42 ng/ml in NCLE group), troponin T
(22.1766.97 pg/ml in NCNE group and 22.7867.76 pg/ml in NCLE group) and antitroponin I IgM (1.9260.43 mg/ml in NCNE
group and 1.7960.36 mg/ml in NCLE group) levels compared to control group, while antitroponin T IgM and IgG were only
elevated in patients with noncompaction and reduced EF (15.8166.52 mg/ml for IgM and 16.4666.25 mg/ml for IgG).
Elevated cardiac troponins and anti-troponin I autoantibodies were observed in patients with noncompaction preceding
the decline in systolic function and could indicate ongoing myocardial damage in these patients.

Introduction
Venricular hypertrabeculation/noncompaction (NC/HT) is a
primarily genetic cardiomyopathy characterized by prominent
trabeculae with deep recessus separating trabeculations [1]. Left
ventricular systolic dysfunction and development of idiopathic
cardiomyopathy are the most important consequences of NC/HT
[1,2]. However, not all patients with NC/HT demonstrate left
ventricular failure, and some patients may remain asymptomatic
for long periods [3]. The cause for transformation to a dilated
cardiomyopathy (DCM) phenotype remains unknown despite
being a topic of active research.
Both cardiac troponin I (cTnI) and cardiac troponin T
(cTnT) are components of myocardial troponin-tropomyosin
complex and elevated serum levels are observed in dilated
cardiomyopathy (DCM) patients due to myocardial necrosis,
apoptosis or myocardial leakage. Elevated troponin levels are
almost invariably related with poor prognosis in DCM patients
[4,5]. Antibodies against various myocardial components,
including cardiac troponins, were observed in patients with left
ventricular systolic dysfunction and in normal individuals [6,7].
Of those, anti-cTnI antibodies were shown to be elevated in
patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (iDCM) and
ischemic cardiomyopathy compared to health controls [8].
Animal studies had demonstrated that autoantibodies against
cTnI could alter calcium currents in mice and produce cardiac
lesions similar to the ones observed in iDCM [9]. While the
evidence does not definitely demonstrate a role for autoimmu￾nity in the development of DCM, it is hypothesized that
immunization against myocardial compartments could accentu￾ate cardiac dysfunction.
While a few studies and report had shown elevated cTnT levels
in NC/HT patients with accompanying neuromuscular disorders
[10], a detailed investigation regarding to troponin and anti￾troponin values in NC/HT patients is missing. In this study, we
aimed to measure serum troponin I and T, as well as antitroponin
I and T levels in a cohort of NC/HT patients with and without left
ventricular systolic dysfunction.

Materials and Methods
Patient Selection
A total of 50 patients with a previous diagnosis of NC/HT and
followed up by institutional heart failure and cardiac transplan￾tation clinic between years 2006 and 2012 were included in this
study. All enrolled patients were re-evaluated to confirm previous
diagnosis of NC/HT as detailed below. Patients who had severe
aortic stenosis or obstructive lesions at left ventricular outflow
tract, complex congenital heart lesions, had existing diseases that
might cause left ventricular dysfunction or other forms of
cardiomyopathy, and patients with previous myocardial infarction
were excluded from study. Patients with left ventricular non￾compaction were separated in two groups based on their ejection
fraction: those with a left ventricular EF of less than 35% (NCLE
group) and those with a left ventricular EF of equal to or more
than 50% (NCNE group). Additionally, twenty-three volunteers
without known coronary artery disease or previous myocardial
infarction and had an ejection fraction equal to or more than 50%
served as healthy controls.
For all subjects, demographic data were collected after inclusion
to study. This study was approved by Dr. Siyami Ersek Hospital
ethics committee and all patients gave their written informed
consent. For patients below 18 years, a written consent was
obtained from legal guardians.
Echocardiographic Examination
Echocardiographic examination was performed with an echo￾cardiography platform (GE Vivid 7, GE Healthcare, Piscataway,
New Jersey, USA) equipped with a 1.5–3.6 MHz phased-array
transducer. Diagnosis of noncompaction was established when all
of these conditions were satisfied from parasternal short-axis view:
observation of three or more prominent trabeculations, deep
recessus in contact with blood, and a noncompacted-to-compacted
myocardium of more than 2 during systole [10,11] (Figure 1). For
all patients, the diagnosis was confirmed by two cardiologists with
experience in transthoracic echocardiography (HBE and NS).
End-diastolic and end systolic volume of left ventricle, as well as
left ventricular ejection fraction were calculated using biplane
Simpson method from apical four-chamber and two chamber
views. Number of segments with hypertrabeculation/noncompac￾tion was calculated from parasternal short axis views at basal, mid
and apical sections of left ventricle using 16-segment model. Mitral
E and A values were measured from the tips of mitral leaflets with
pulsed-wave Doppler in apical 4-chamber view. Isovolumic
contraction time (IVCT) and isovolumic relaxation time (IVRT)
were measured with continuous-wave (CW) Doppler with cursor
aligned to record both mitral inflow and aortic outflow velocities
from apical long axis view. Aortic ejection time (AET) was
measured from aortic outflow recordings taken with CW Doppler
from apical long axis view. Early diastolic velocity of mitral
annulus (Em) was measured from the lateral aspect of mitral valve
with TDI from apical 4-chamber view. Left ventricular myocardial
performance index was calculated as (IVCT+IVRT)/AET. For all
enrolled subjects, a detailed echocardiogram was carried out to
rule out other types of cardiomyopathy, more than mild valvular
diseases or congenital defects.
Blood Withdrawal and Analysis
Patients and healthy controls were recalled one day after
echocardiographic examination with overnight fasting before

collection of blood samples. Whole blood samples were obtained
from subjects in the supine position from the antecubital vein with
a 20-gauge needle by applying minimal tourniquet force. For all
subjects, 8 cc blood was collected in a dry tube and measurements
for cTnI, cTnT, antitroponin I IgM, antitroponin T IgM and
antitroponin T IgG were made as detailed below. The laboratory
was blinded for samples.
Measurement for Cardiac Troponins
A serum separator tube was used and samples were allowed to
clot for 30 minutes before centrifugation for 20 minutes at
approximately 10006g. Samples were then stored at a tempera￾ture between 220u and 280uC. Design of the assay was based on
a sandwich enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using
Dimension analyzer (Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany).
The microtiter plate provided in the kit had been precoated with a
monoclonal antibody specific to human troponin I or troponin T.
Samples were pippetted into these wells. Unbound troponin and
other components of the sample were removed by washing and
biotin conjugated monoclonal antibody (Biovendor, Heidelberg,
Germany) specific to troponin I or troponin T was added. To
quantitatively determine the amount of troponin I or troponin T
present in the sample, avidin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase
was then added to each microplate well. Next, a TMB-substrate
solution was added to each well. Finally, a sulfiric acid solution was
added and a resulting yellow colored product was formed. The
optical density of wells was determined using a microplate reader
set to 450 nm. The absorbance is directly proportional to the
amount of captured troponin I or troponin T.

Troponin and Antitroponin in Noncompaction
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 3 February 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 2 | e57648

Measurement for Antitroponin I or Antitroponin T
The samples were kept at room temperature for 20 minutes to
allow clotting, were centrifuged, and were then stored at 220
degrees. The values listed of marker represent the peak
concentrations during each collection period. A sandwich enzyme
immunologic assay (ELISA) method was used with a Dimension
analyzer (Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany). Based on a
technique using the streptavidin, the single step sandwich assay
allowed serial determination of blood samples to be made within 2
hours. The test was carried out in microprocessor-controlled
photometers and required streptavidin-coated tubes and two
monoclonal antihuman cardiac anti troponin T and anti troponin
I antibodies (Biovendor, Heidelberg, Germany). During a 60
minute incubation period, the antigen was bound by one
biotinylated and one peroxidase-labeled antibody. This complex
adhered to the test tube wall because of the high affinity
streptavidin-biotin interaction. After two washing steps, the
substrate chromogen was added.
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 17.0 (IBM,
Armonk, NY). Quantitative data was given as mean 6 SD and
categorical data was given as percentages. Distribution of scalar
data was determined with Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. For scalar
variables, comparisons between groups were performed with one￾way ANOVA and post-hoc Scheffe test or Kruskal-Wallis and
Mann-Whitney U tests, as appropriate. For categorical variables,
x2 and Fisher’s exact tests were used. Correlation analyses were
performed using Spearman’s rho. A p value of ,0.05 was
accepted as significant.
Results
Demographic and clinical data, including previous medications
and interventions regarding to study groups are given in Table 1.
There were no significant difference between patients regarding to
age, gender, history of hypertension, history of diabetes, smoking
habits and family history of cardiomyopathy. Arrhythmic events
were observed significantly higher in patients with noncompaction
compared to controls. Left ventricular end diastolic and end
systolic volumes were higher in NCLE group compared to other
groups (170.25640.86 ml vs. 140.99653.05 ml and
97.35626.75 ml; p,0.05 for LVEDv and 121.45632.01 ml vs.
71.58646.49 ml and 27.4567.46 ml; p,0.001 for LVESv), and
in NCNE group compared to healthy controls (p,0.01 for
LVEDv and p,0.001 for LVESv). Left ventricular ejection
fraction was significantly lesser in NCLE group (28.08%
67.08%) compared to NCNE (56.87% 66.05%) group and
healthy volunteers (61.82% 63.28%, p,0.001) and also signifi￾cantly lower in NCNE group compared to controls (p,0.01).
Ratio of mitral E wave to A wave was similar between groups,
while ratio of mitral E wave to Em was significantly higher in
NCLE group (p,0.05). Left ventricular myocardial performance
index was significantly higher in NCLE group compared to both
groups (p,0.001). Number of segments with hypertrabeculation/
noncompaction was significantly higher in NCLE group
(4.0561.13) compared to NCNE group (2.4460.62; p,0.001)
(Table 2).
Both troponin T and troponin I levels were significantly higher
in both NC/HT groups (22.1766.97 pg/ml in NCNE group and
22.7867.76 pg/ml in NCLE group for troponin T;
28.9869.21 ng/ml for NCNE group and 28.11610.42 ng/ml
for NCLE group for troponin I) compared to controls
(13.4264.19 pg/ml for troponin T, p,0.01 and 9.7461.97 ng/
ml for troponin I, p,0.001). Anti-troponin I IgM antibodies were
significantly higher in NC/HT patients (1.9260.43 mg/ml for
NCNE group and 1.7960.36 mg/ml for NCLE group) compared
to healthy volunteers (0.8060.23 mg/ml for controls, p,0.001). In
contrast, anti-troponin T IgM levels are only elevated in patients
with noncompaction and systolic dysfunction (15.8166.52 mg/ml)

compared to patients in NCNE group (12.3365.68 mg/ml,
p,0.05) and healthy controls (12.0062.32 mg/ml, p,0.05).
Anti-troponin T IgG levels were similar to that of IgM levels
(11.9162.33 mg/ml for healthy controls, 12.3465.80 mg/ml for
NCNE group and 16.4666.25 mg/ml for NCLE group, p = 0.01)
(Figure 2).
Troponin I and antitroponin I IgM levels showed a significant
correlation with each other (r = 0.696, p,0.001); while both
parameters did not show a significant correlation with LVEF,
LVEDv or LVESv in noncompaction patients. Troponin T did
not correlate with antitroponin T IgM or IgG levels (r = 20.087,
p.0.05 for IgM and r = 20.057, p.0.05 for IgG), and both
parameters lacked a significant correlation with LVEF, LVEDv or
LVESv in noncompaction patients (Figure 3). No significant
correlation was observed between cTnI, cTnT, anti-cTnI IgM,
anti-cTnT IgM or anti-cTnT IgG levels and number of segments
with hypertrabeculation/noncompaction.
Discussion
Cardiac troponins C, T and I are a part of troponin￾tropomyosin complex, which control interaction of actin with
myosin. Appearance of cardiac-specific troponins in circulation
reflects myocardial damage. Chronic elevation of cardiac specific
troponins is observed in conditions such as ischemic or dilated
cardiomyopathies, presumably related with ongoing myocellular
destruction [11]. Elevated troponin levels are almost invariably
associated with poor prognosis in ischemic and dilated cardiomy￾opathy patients [12].
Our results show that both cardiac troponin I and cardiac
troponin T were elevated in patients with NC/HT, regardless of
initial systolic function. In patients with DCM, elevated troponin I
and T are associated with myocyte injury or death and a
progression of heart failure [4,5,12]. Therefore, increased troponin
levels in study group suggest ongoing myocyte disruption or loss in
NC/HT patients before and after reduction of ejection fraction. It
is also noteworthy to recall that patients in NC/HT group and
preserved ejection fraction had higher LVEDv and LVESv

compared to controls, which could also indicate a progression
from normal systolic function to dilated cardiomyopathy pheno￾type.
Anti-troponin antibodies are formed after exposure of troponins
to circulation. They could be observed in very low quantities in
normal individuals [6] and detected more frequently in patients
after a myocardial infarction and dilated cardiomyopathy [8].
Experimentally, anti-troponin I autoantibodies are capable of
altering calcium currents in cultivated myocardial cells and could
produce ‘‘dilated cardiomyopathy-like’’ lesions [9]. In another
study, exposure to anti-troponin I antibodies caused inflammatory
myocarditis in mice [13]. Clinical studies had indicated a worse
prognosis for patients with positive cTnI antibodies after an acute
myocardial infarction [14]. Patients with iDCM who are positive
for anti-cTnI antibodies had a trend towards increased left
ventricular volume and heightened sympathetic activity [15]. In
contrast, another study indicated that cell-mediated immune
response against troponins could act to reduce immune response
[16]. So far, only an association with anti-cTnI antibodies and
cardiomyopathy could be demonstrated. Anti-cTnT antibodies
were incapable of inducing myocardial damage, possibly due to
sarcoplasmic location of cTnT [9].
We have shown that anti-cTnI IgM antibodies are elevated in
patients with NC/HT, regardless of initial ventricular function.
This finding is compatible with high cTnI levels in patients with
NC/HT with or without reduction of ejection fraction. Since anti￾cTnI antibodies are capable of inducing myocardial damage, it is
possible that observed anti-cTnI antibody levels could initiate or
progress systolic dysfunction in NC/HT patients. However, this
hypothesis remains as a deduction and remains to be proven. In
contrast, we observed that anti-cTnT IgM and IgG antibodies
were elevated only in a subgroup of patients with NC/HT and
reduced EF. Despite the fact that anti-cTnT antibodies could be
produced after immunization with cTnT in mice, no damage to
myocardial cells could be demonstrated [9]. As clinical trials were
usually conducted with anti-cTnI rather than anti-cTnT, less
information is available regarding to prognosis of anti-cTnT
positive patients. While we observed higher anti-cTnT IgM and
IgG in patients with NC/HT and reduced EF, no increase was
observed in patients with NC/HT and normal systolic function.
Based on previous experimental data, we assume that the effect of
anti-cTnT antibodies on systolic dysfunction could be minimal.
Despite intense concern, left ventricular noncompaction
remains an enigmatic disease. NC/HT can be observed in
isolation or accompanying congenital anomalies or muscular
dystrophies [17,18]. This condition is thought to arise from an
embryonic arrest in myocardial compaction process [19], while
acquired NC/HT was also reported [20]. More importantly, the
cause of ventricular dilatation and decline in systolic function is
still not known. Our data shows that elevation in troponins and
anti-troponin I autoantibodies, along with changes in ventricular
geometry (increased end systolic and end diastolic diameters)
precede reduction in systolic function. However, our data is
insufficient to reveal the nature of ventricular damage before
appearance of heart failure or whether autoimmunity plays a role
in cardiac dysfunction.
Study Limitations
This study is designed solely to investigate troponin and
antitroponin antibody levels in patients with NC/HT. Our results
should be interpreted with caution, as the presence of antibodies
themselves does not imply a causal relationship between left
ventricular dysfunction and immunity-mediated damage to

for antitroponin I IgM (A), antitroponin T IgM (B) and antitroponin T IgG
(C) did not reach statistical significance and had low correlation
coefficients. Note that antitroponin T IgM levels were similar to
antitroponin T IgG levels (in panels B and C).

myocytes. The causative role of antitroponin antibodies in the
development of DCM is also debated.
A rise in antitroponin autoantibodies is not specific to NC/HT￾related ventricular failure and was previously shown to be related
with other causes of dilated cardiomyopathy [21]. Therefore, a rise
in anti-troponin antibody levels could be anticipated in patients
with reduced EF, regardless of initial etiologic factor. Nevertheless,
our results did show a rise in autoantibody levels (for cTnI) before
development of systolic dysfunction, which diverts our study with
previously conducted studies on DCM.
Regrettably, we were unable to study anti-cTnI IgG antibodies,
as we could not obtain necessary reagent. While anti-cTnT IgM
and IgG levels were similar between groups, we could not verify
whether anti-cTnI IgG levels followed a similar pattern with anti￾cTnI IgM. While we expect a similar pattern between groups for
anti-cTnI IgM and anti-cTnI IgG, as antigenic stimulation is
continuous rather than intermittent, another study will be needed
to confirm that.
Conclusion
In conclusion, this is the first study that examines troponin levels
and antitroponin autoantibodies in NC/HT. Our results show
that both troponin I and T levels were elevated in patients with
NC/HT, regardless of systolic function. Anti-troponin I levels
were also elevated in both NC/HT groups, while antitroponin T
levels were only elevated in patients with NC/HT and reduced
EF. While these results point to ongoing myocardial damage and
autoimmune response in NC/HT patients, further studies are
required to ascertain the role of autoimmunity in NC/HT.
