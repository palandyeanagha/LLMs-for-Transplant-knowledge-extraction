ABSTRACT
OBJECTIVE
To assess the efficacy and safety of 
hydroxychloroquine plus standard of care compared 
with standard of care alone in adults with coronavirus 
disease 2019 (covid-19).
DESIGN
Multicentre, open label, randomised controlled trial.
SETTING
16 government designated covid-19 treatment centres 
in China, 11 to 29 February 2020.
PARTICIPANTS
150 patients admitted to hospital with laboratory 
confirmed covid-19 were included in the intention 
to treat analysis (75 patients assigned to 
hydroxychloroquine plus standard of care, 75 to 
standard of care alone).
INTERVENTIONS
Hydroxychloroquine administrated at a loading 
dose of 1200 mg daily for three days followed by a 
maintenance dose of 800 mg daily (total treatment 
duration: two or three weeks for patients with mild to 
moderate or severe disease, respectively).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE
Negative conversion of severe acute respiratory 
syndrome coronavirus 2 by 28 days, analysed 
according to the intention to treat principle. Adverse 
events were analysed in the safety population 
in which hydroxychloroquine recipients were 
participants who received at least one dose of 
hydroxychloroquine and hydroxychloroquine non￾recipients were those managed with standard of care 
alone.
RESULTS
Of 150 patients, 148 had mild to moderate disease 
and two had severe disease. The mean duration 
from symptom onset to randomisation was 16.6 
(SD 10.5; range 3-41) days. A total of 109 (73%) 
patients (56 standard of care; 53 standard of care 
plus hydroxychloroquine) had negative conversion 
well before 28 days, and the remaining 41 (27%) 
patients (19 standard of care; 22 standard of care 
plus hydroxychloroquine) were censored as they did 
not reach negative conversion of virus. The probability 
of negative conversion by 28 days in the standard 
of care plus hydroxychloroquine group was 85.4% 
(95% confidence interval 73.8% to 93.8%), similar 
to that in the standard of care group (81.3%, 71.2% 
to 89.6%). The difference between groups was 4.1% 
(95% confidence interval –10.3% to 18.5%). In the 
safety population, adverse events were recorded in 
7/80 (9%) hydroxychloroquine non-recipients and in 
21/70 (30%) hydroxychloroquine recipients. The most 
common adverse event in the hydroxychloroquine 
recipients was diarrhoea, reported in 7/70 (10%) 
patients. Two hydroxychloroquine recipients reported 
serious adverse events.
CONCLUSIONS
Administration of hydroxychloroquine did not result 
in a significantly higher probability of negative 
conversion than standard of care alone in patients 
admitted to hospital with mainly persistent mild to 
moderate covid-19. Adverse events were higher in 
hydroxychloroquine recipients than in non-recipients.

Introduction
Coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19), caused by 
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 
(SARS-CoV-2), spread to most countries in the world 
within five months of initial reports in China. As of 22 
April 2020, more than 2.5 million infections and 178 
thousand deaths had been reported.1
Several drugs, including remdesivir, favipiravir, 
ribavirin, lopinavir-ritonavir (used in combination), 
and chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine, have 
been highlighted on the basis of promising in vitro

WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPIC
The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) imposes a substantial 
burden on individuals, communities, healthcare facilities, markets, and 
governments globally
No specific treatment has been approved for covid-19, and no vaccine exists to 
prevent infection with SARS-CoV-2
During the urgent pandemic, media headlines encourage the use of drugs 
without solid evidence but ignore the side effects of these drugs
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS
In this randomised clinical trial of patients with mainly persistent mild to 
moderate covid-19, exposure to hydroxychloroquine led to a similar probability 
of virus elimination to the current standard of care
Adverse events, mostly gastrointestinal, were significantly higher in patients who 
received hydroxychloroquine
Overall, the results do not support the use of hydroxychloroquine in patients 
with persistent mild to moderate covid-19

results and therapeutic experiences from two other 
coronavirus diseases—severe acute respiratory 
syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome.2
However, none of these promising results has yet 
been translated into clinical benefits in patients with 
covid-19, with a failed trial of lopinavir-ritonavir being 
the most recently reported.3
Chloroquine and its hydroxyl analogue 
hydroxychloroquine, best known as antimalarial 
drugs, are prominent on the list of potential covid-19 
treatments, owing to potent antiviral activity against 
SARS-CoV-2 in the in vitro studies and news reports 
of promising results from some ongoing trials.4-6
Despite their unclear benefits, chloroquine and 
hydroxychloroquine are both recommended for 
off label use in the treatment of covid-19 by the 
Chinese national guideline,7
 and the US Food and 
Drug Administration recently authorised them for 
emergency use.8
 US president Donald Trump also 
recently recommended use of hydroxychloroquine. 
Such a presidential endorsement stimulated an rapid 
increase in demand for hydroxychloroquine, which 
obscured the negative aspects of this drug. Deaths due 
to chloroquine overdoses have been reported in Nigeria 
among people self-treating for apparent covid-19.9
Retinopathy and gastrointestinal and cardiac side 
effects are well documented with the use of chloroquine 
or hydroxychloroquine in the treatment of malarial and 
rheumatic diseases.10 Hydroxychloroquine is preferred 
in clinical applications owing to its lower toxicity, 
particularly retinal toxicity,10 and three times the 
potency against SARS-CoV-2 infection compared with 
chloroquine in a recent in vitro study.5
 No convincing 
evidence from well designed clinical trials exists to 
support the use of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine 
with good efficacy and safety for the treatment of 
covid-19. Rapidly conducting such trials with high 
quality is challenging in the face of a dangerous 
coronavirus outbreak, in which healthcare workers 
have an overwhelming amount of work and the highest 
risk of developing covid-19.11
Having encountered many challenges, we conducted 
a multicentre, open label, randomised controlled trial 
to assess the efficacy and safety of hydroxychloroquine 
sulfate in adult patients with covid-19.
Methods
Trial oversight
The principal investigators (QX, GS, GN, and JQ) 
designed and initiated the study after approval of 
the protocol by the institutional review board in 
Ruijin Hospital on 6 February 2020. The protocol 
and approval documents are available in the online 
supplement. All patients gave written informed 
consent. The principal investigators invited hospitals 
with the capability to provide the current standard of 
care for covid-19 to participate in the study. Minimum 
requirements for the standard of care included the 
provision of intravenous fluids, supplemental oxygen, 
regular laboratory testing, SARS-CoV-2 testing, 
haemodynamic monitoring, and intensive care, as 
well as the ability to deliver concomitant medications. 
The trial was conducted urgently during the outbreak 
of covid-19 in compliance with the Declaration of 
Helsinki, Good Clinical Practice guidelines, and local 
regulatory requirements. Shanghai Pharmaceuticals 
Holding donated the investigated drug, 
hydroxychloroquine but was not involved in the study 
design, accrual, analyses of data, or preparation of the 
manuscript. A contract research organisation, R&G 
PharmaStudies, was hired to assist in the study design, 
data collection and cleaning, and statistical analyses. 
Data were recorded by clinical research coordinators, 
followed by queries from clinical research associates. 
The study statistician then entered confirmed data 
into the OpenClinica database for statistical analyses 
performed by and reviewed by the senior statistician 
in accordance with Good Clinical Practice guidelines. 
Data collection forms and statistical analysis plans are 
available in the online supplement.
An independent data and safety monitoring 
committee (IDMC) periodically reviewed the progress 
and oversight of the study. The interim analysis took 
place on 14 March, and the results were presented 
to the IDMC. The rapid decline in eligible new 
cases of covid-19 in China at that time precluded 
recruitment of our targeted number of patients. 
After a two round extensive review of the efficacy 
and safety data generated from the interim analysis, 
the IDMC endorsed an early termination of the trial. 
Members of the committee all agreed that the data 
from the trial are important for clinicians, the public, 
and the government to avoid inappropriate use of 
hydroxychloroquine in the clinical management of 
covid-19, particularly in areas with overwhelming 
patient numbers. The report of the trial could be an 
important resource to facilitate better design of future 
trials. The results of this clinical trial are reported in 
accordance with CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of 
Reporting Trials) guidelines.
Trial design, randomisation, and procedures
This study was a multicentre, randomised, parallel, open 
label trial of hydroxychloroquine in patients admitted 
to hospital with covid-19. Patients were enrolled by 
the site investigators in 16 government designated 
covid-19 treatment centres in three provinces in China 
(Hubei, Henan, and Anhui). No placebo was used, and 
drugs were not masked. We applied stratified random 
sampling to stratify all eligible patients according to 
disease severity (mild/moderate or severe), followed 
by random assignment (in a 1:1 ratio) in each stratum 
to ensure a balanced distribution of disease severity 
between treatment (hydroxychloroquine plus standard 
of care) and control (standard of care only) groups. LL 
designed the randomisation rules together with the 
principal investigators, and an independent statistician 
who was not involved in data analysis implemented 
them. Equal numbers of cards with each group 
assignment number randomly generated by computer 
were placed in sequentially numbered envelopes that 
were opened as the patients were enrolled. All patients

were managed with standard of care aligned with the 
indications from the updated national clinical practice 
guidelines for covid-19 in China. Patients in the 
treatment group were given hydroxychloroquine within 
24 hours after randomisation, with a loading dose of 
1200 mg daily for three days followed by a maintenance 
dose of 800 mg daily for the remaining days (total 
treatment duration was two weeks for patients with 
mild to moderate disease and three weeks for those 
with severe disease). The dose of hydroxychloroquine 
was adjusted when adverse events were related to 
hydroxychloroquine, as judged by investigators. 
Details of dose adjustment are provided in the study 
protocol available in the online supplement. Patients, 
investigators, and statisticians were not masked to 
treatment assignment. Laboratory technicians who did 
virological, chemical, and other routine measurements 
were unaware of treatment information.
Patients
Inclusion criteria were age 18 years or older, ongoing 
SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed in upper or lower 
respiratory tract specimens with real time reverse 
transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), 
willingness to participate, and consent not to be 
enrolled in other clinical trials during the study period. 
Pneumonia on computed tomography of the chest was 
not mandatory for inclusion.
Exclusion criteria were age below 18 years; severe 
conditions including malignancies, heart, liver, or 
kidney disease or poorly controlled metabolic diseases; 
unsuitability for oral administration; pregnancy or 
lactation; allergy to hydroxychloroquine; inability 
to cooperate with investigators due to cognitive 
impairments or poor mental status; severe hepatic 
impairment (for example, Child Pugh grade C, alanine 
aminotransferase more than fivefold the upper limit); 
and severe renal impairment (estimated glomerular 
filtration rate ≤30 mL/min/1.73 m2
) or receipt of 
continuous renal replacement therapy, haemodialysis, 
or peritoneal dialysis. In the original protocol, patients 
with severe covid-19 were excluded. Considering that 
the anti-inflammatory property of hydroxychloroquine 
might favour disease regression, we decided to include 
patients with severe covid-19 (change approved by the 
ethics committee on 17 February 2020).
The definition of disease severity of covid-19 was 
based on the fifth version of the Chinese guideline for 
the management of covid-19.12 Mild disease includes 
patients with mild symptoms but no manifestation of 
pneumonia on imaging. Moderate disease includes 
patients with fever, cough, sputum production, and 
other respiratory tract or non-specific symptoms along 
with manifestation of pneumonia on imaging but no 
signs of severe pneumonia defined as the presence of 
SaO2
/SpO2
 below 94% on room air or a PaO2
 to FiO2
ratio of 300 or lower.
Assessment
Specimens from the upper respiratory tract, lower 
respiratory tract, or both were obtained from each 
patient on screening (day –3 to day 1) and during 
treatment and post-treatment follow-up at scheduled 
visits on days 4, 7, 10, 14, 21, and 28. The local Centre 
for Disease Control and Prevention or authorised 
health institutions or hospitals at each site measured 
SARS-CoV-2 by using assays approved by the National 
Medical Products Administration. Measurements 
were performed according to the recommendations 
of the National Institute for Viral Disease Control 
and Prevention (China) (http://ivdc.chinacdc.cn/
kyjz/202001/t20200121_211337.html). Methods 
for extraction and amplification of total RNA through 
RT-PCR were similar to those described elsewhere.13
Rather than quantitative data (cycle threshold value) 
reported from the RT-PCR assay, we collected only 
qualitative data reported from our trial sites. On the 
basis of a national recommendation, we defined a cycle 
threshold value less than 37 as a positive test result and 
a cycle threshold value of 40 or more as a negative test. 
Cycle threshold values between 37 and 40 confirmed 
by retesting were reported as unclassified.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2 testing, patients were 
assessed on each scheduled visit for vital signs, C 
reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, tumour 
necrosis factor α, interleukin 6, complete blood cell 
count with differential, blood chemistry, coagulation 
panel, pulse oximetry, and respiratory symptoms. 
Records of administration of hydroxychloroquine and 
adverse events were reviewed daily to ensure fidelity 
to the protocol and, more importantly, patient safety. 
Computed tomography of the chest was assessed on 
screening and at the last visit of the treatment period 
(day 14 for patients with mild to moderate disease 
and day 21 for severe disease). Computed tomography 
examinations of the chest could be exempted by the 
investigators if the participants could provide qualified 
examination results within three days before the 
start of the study. More details on data collection are 
provided in the protocol available in the supplement.
Outcome
The primary outcomes for this trial were whether 
patients had negative conversion of SARS-CoV-2 by 28 
days and whether patients with severe covid-19 had 
clinical improvement by 28 days. However, as the trial 
was stopped early and only two patients with severe 
disease were enrolled, results on clinical improvement 
are not presented. We defined negative conversion of 
SARS-CoV-2 as two consecutive reports of a negative 
result for SARS-CoV-2 at least 24 hours apart without 
a subsequent report of a positive result by the end of 
the study. We considered the date of the first negative 
report as the date of negative conversion. In the original 
protocol, the primary endpoint was prespecified as the 
“Negative conversion rate by Day 10” (approved by the 
ethics committee on 6 February 2020). However, with 
the increasing knowledge of covid-19 from our clinical 
practice, we realised that the duration of SARS-CoV-2 
in respiratory samples of many patients was longer 
than 10 days, recently highlighted by a detailed 
virological study.14 We therefore modified our primary

outcome to test whether patients had a negative 
conversion of SARS-CoV-2 by 28 days (approved by the 
ethics committee on 17 February 2020). Probability 
of negative conversion at day 4, 7, 10, 14, or 21 was 
specified as a secondary outcome in the protocol, 
but this does not appear on the trial registration list. 
The listed secondary outcome in the trial registration 
was adverse events coded using the latest version of 
Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities coding 
dictionary, recorded in standard medical terminology 
and graded according to the National Cancer Institute 
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events.
Other prespecified secondary outcomes not listed in 
the trial registration but included in the protocol were 
the probabilities of alleviation of clinical symptoms; 
improvement of C reactive protein, erythrocyte 
sedimentation rate, tumour necrosis factor α, 
interleukin 6, and absolute blood lymphocyte count; 
improvement of lung lesions on chest radiology; all 
cause death; and disease progression in patients with 
mild to moderate disease. The time frame for these 
secondary outcomes was from randomisation to 28 
days. Prespecified secondary outcomes for patients 
with severe disease are not listed here but are included 
in the protocol. Owing to the early termination of 
our study, we could not justify the results from these 
analyses with an underpowered sample size and 
therefore decided not to emphasise them in this paper 
to avoid misinterpretation. The only one presented here 
is the alleviation of clinical symptoms within 28 days, 
which is an important outcome of interest prespecified 
in our protocol. The definition of the alleviation of 
clinical symptoms was resolving from fever to an 
axillary temperature of 36.6°C or below, normalisation 
of SpO2
 (>94% on room air), and disappearance of 
respiratory symptoms including nasal congestion, 
cough, sore throat, sputum production, and shortness 
of breath.
Statistical analysis
In the original protocol, the target number of 
enrolments was set to 200 without type I error control. 
In the updated protocol (approved by the ethics 
committee on 10 February 2020), we considered type 
I and type II error control and recalculated the sample 
size. The sample size was calculated on the basis of the 
alternative hypothesis of a 30% increase in the rate 
of conversion to negative for SARS-CoV-2 as defined 
by virus nucleic acid negativity. With the assumption 
that time to conversion follows an exponential 
distribution, if the median time to conversion with 
hydroxychloroquine can be reduced from 10 days to 
seven days, a total of 248 events would provide a power 
of 80% to detect a hazard ratio of 0.7 (standard of care v
hydroxychloroquine) with a log rank test. Additionally, 
we assumed a 75 day accrual period and a seven day 
follow-up after enrolment of the last patient, so about 
360 patients (180 per group) would be randomised 
in the study. An interim analysis was planned when 
around 150 patients were treated for at least seven 
days. We applied the O’Brien-Fleming cumulative α
spending function by Lan-DeMets algorithm to control 
for family-wise type I error=0.05.
We estimated the overall probability of negative 
conversion by analysing time to negative conversion 
of SARS-CoV-2 using the Kaplan-Meier method in the 
intention to treat population and compared groups 
with a log rank test. We considered patients who did 
not reach the negative conversion of SARS-CoV-2 (see 
definition in Outcome section) by the cut-off date of 
the analysis (14 March 2020) to be right censored 
at the last visit date. All these patients remained in 
hospital and may have reached negative conversion 
after our last visit date, but the specific timing of the 
event is unknown. We applied similar approaches to 
the analysis of alleviation of symptoms. We used the 
rate difference between groups to show the treatment 
effect size and estimated 95% confidence intervals by 
an approximate normal distribution and the standard 
error by the bootstrap method (n=1000). We used a 
Cox model to estimate the hazard ratio. Hazard ratios 
greater than one indicate that the rate of negative 
conversion of virus or alleviation of symptoms was 
higher in the hydroxychloroquine plus standard of care 
group than in the standard of care only group. Safety 
analyses were based on the patients’ actual exposure to 
treatment. We used SAS version 9.4 for data analyses.
Patient and public involvement
No patients were involved in setting the research 
question or the outcome measures, nor were they 
involved in developing plans for recruitment, design, 
or implementation of the study. No patients were asked 
to advise on interpretation or writing up of results. 
There are no plans to disseminate the results of the 
research to study participants or the relevant patient 
community.
Results
Patients
Of 191 patients admitted to hospital with covid-19 from 
11 to 29 February 2020, 41 did not meet the eligibility 
criteria. The remaining 150 patients were randomised: 
75 patients were assigned to standard of care and 75 
patients to standard of care plus hydroxychloroquine 
(fig 1). The mean age of the patients was 46 years, and 
82 (55%) were male. The mean duration from onset 
of symptoms to randomisation was 16.6 (SD 10.5; 
range 3-41) days, and 90 (60%) patients received 
concomitant drug treatment before randomisation. 
Among these, 52 (35%) patients received antiviral 
treatment (table 1). Almost all (148; 99%) patients had 
mild to moderate covid-19, and only 2 (1%) patients 
had severe disease on screening. Table 1 shows 
baseline demographic, epidemiological, and clinical 
characteristics of the patients in the two groups.
By 14 March 2020 (the cut-off date for data 
analysis), the median duration of follow-up was 
21 (range 2-33) days in the standard of care group 
and 20 (3-31) days in the standard of care plus 
hydroxychloroquine group; nine patients in each 
group had completed 28 days of follow-up. Of the

75 patients assigned to receive standard of care 
plus hydroxychloroquine, six patients did not 
receive any dose of hydroxychloroquine (three 
withdrew consent and three refused to be treated 
with hydroxychloroquine). Concomitant treatments, 
including antiviral agents, antibiotics, and systemic 
glucocorticoid therapy, were similar in the two 
groups (table 2). One patient with moderate disease 
in the hydroxychloroquine group progressed to severe 
covid-19, and no patients died during follow-up.
Primary outcome
A total of 109 (73%) patients (56 standard of care; 53 
standard of care plus hydroxychloroquine) had negative 
conversion well before 28 days, and the remaining 
41 (27%) patients (19 standard of care; 22 standard 
of care plus hydroxychloroquine) were censored as 
they did not reach negative conversion of virus. The 
maximum duration for a patient with positive SARS￾CoV-2 was 23 days by the cut-off date of our analysis. 
Overall, the probability of negative conversion of SARS￾CoV-2 among patients who were assigned to receive 
standard of care plus hydroxychloroquine was 85.4% 
(95% confidence interval 73.8% to 93.8%) by 28 days, 
similar to that of the standard of care group (81.3%, 
71.2% to 89.6%). The difference in the probability of 
negative conversion between standard of care plus 
hydroxychloroquine and standard of care alone was 
4.1% (95% confidence interval –10.3% to 18.5%). The 
median time to negative conversion was also similar in 
the standard of care plus hydroxychloroquine group (8 
(95% confidence interval 5 to 10) days) to that in the 
standard of care group (7 (5 to 8) days) (hazard ratio 
0.85, 95% confidence interval 0.58 to 1.23; P=0.34 by 
log rank test; fig 2).
Safety
Six patients who were assigned to the standard of 
care plus hydroxychloroquine group but did not 
receive hydroxychloroquine treatment were classified 
as hydroxychloroquine non-recipients in the safety 
population. One patient in the standard of care group 
wrongly received 14 days of hydroxychloroquine 
treatment with an accumulative dose of 11600 mg. 
This patient was classified as a hydroxychloroquine 
recipient in the safety population (fig 1). We compared 
safety endpoints between hydroxychloroquine 
recipients and non-recipients (table 3). In 
hydroxychloroquine recipients, the median duration 
of hydroxychloroquine treatment was 14 (range 
1-22) days. Between randomisation and the final 
visit, 21 (30%) patients in the standard of care plus 
hydroxychloroquine group reported adverse events, 
compared with 7 (9%) patients in the standard of 
care group (table 3). No serious adverse events were 
reported in the standard of care group. Two patients 
in the hydroxychloroquine group reported serious 
adverse events due to disease progression and 
upper respiratory infection. The patient with upper 
respiratory infection was discharged after finishing 
the 14 days of treatment with hydroxychloroquine 
and developed throat drying and pharyngalgia 
requiring readmission without evidence of pneumonia 
on computed tomography of the chest during the 
extended follow-up period.
The most common adverse event in the standard of 
care plus hydroxychloroquine group was diarrhoea, 
reported in 7 (10%) patients, which was not reported 
in the standard of care group. Hydroxychloroquine was 
discontinued in one patient owing to blurred vision 
and was adjusted to give a lower dose in one patient

who reported thirst. These two adverse events were 
both transient with a duration of one to two days.
Secondary outcome
Probability of negative conversion by a specific time 
point—4, 7, 10, 14, or 21 days—was also similar in the 
two groups (supplementary table A). The probability 
of alleviation of symptoms by 28 days was similar in 
patients with standard of care with hydroxychloroquine 
(59.9%, 95% confidence interval 45.0% to 75.3%) 
and without hydroxychloroquine (66.6%, 39.5% to 
90.9%). The difference between groups was –6.6% 
(–41.3% to 28.0%). The median time to alleviation of 
clinical symptoms was similar in the standard of care 
plus hydroxychloroquine group to that in the standard 
of care group (19 v 21 days; hazard ratio 1.01, 0.59 to 
1.74; P=0.97 by log rank test; fig 3).
Discussion
This study (conducted during the outbreak of covid-19 
in China) is the first randomised controlled trial 
evaluating administration of hydroxychloroquine in 
patients with covid-19. The findings do not provide 
evidence to support an increase in the probability 
of negative conversion of SARS-CoV-2 conferred by 
the addition of hydroxychloroquine administration 
to the current standard of care in patients admitted 
to hospital with mainly persistent mild to moderate 
covid-19.
Comparison with other studies
The negative results on the antiviral efficacy of 
hydroxychloroquine obtained in this trial are 
contradictory to the encouraging in vitro results and 
the recently reported promising results from a non￾randomised trial in 36 patients with covid-19.4-6
Participants in our trial had mainly mild to moderate 
disease, with a median 16 day delay between symptom 
onset and hydroxychloroquine treatment, so the 
negative results of our trial are applicable only to 
patients with persistently mild to moderate covid-19. 
Covid-19 has overwhelmed hospital systems during 
the pandemic, and many of these patients may be 
treated in the community and may finally be admitted 
to hospital because of a need for oxygen or owing 
to rapid deterioration of the disease. Data from our 
trial do not provide evidence to support the use of 
hydroxychloroquine in this population, particularly 
considering the increased adverse events (discussed 
below). Our trial could not assess the antiviral efficacy 
of hydroxychloroquine at an earlier stage, such as 
within 48 hours of onset of the illness, the golden 
window for antiviral treatment in influenza.15 However, 
conducting such a trial is challenging in patients 
admitted to hospital and will be easier in outpatient or 
community settings. The fact that antiviral treatment 
was not restricted in our trial should also be considered 
when interpreting our results. Seeing the antiviral 
effects of hydroxychloroquine when compared with

a “pure” control arm would be more conclusive. In 
the early dangerous outbreak of covid-19 in China, 
however, setting a restriction on drugs that could be 
potentially useful was not ethical. Nevertheless, the 
use of antiviral drugs before and after randomisation 
was balanced between the hydroxychloroquine and 
standard of care groups and thus might have little 
effect on our primary endpoint. Moreover, use of a 
higher dose of hydroxychloroquine than was used 
in our trial is not likely to have additional antiviral 
effects, because the dosage of hydroxychloroquine that 
we chose achieves the 50% effective concentration 
(EC50) of hydroxychloroquine against SARS-CoV-2,5
although we did not monitor the concentration of 
hydroxychloroquine in our study. Another important 
message from our trial is that the Kaplan-Meier curve 
crossed over with time, suggesting a potential for a non￾constant hazard ratio of negative conversion conferred 
by exposure to hydroxychloroquine. Therefore, 
the hazard ratios presented in our trial should be 
interpreted as weighted results over time rather than 
as a definitive constant. We will investigate this in the 
future. Further trials might also need to combat this 
problem when using the Cox regression method. Taken 
together, future studies could take advantage of our 
results to design trials in a more selective population, 
at the earliest stage possible (<48 hours from illness 
onset), and using more sensitive endpoints, such as 
viral load shedding.
Hydroxychloroquine in our trial was given at a 
loading dose of 1200 mg daily for three days followed 
by a maintenance dose of 800 mg daily for a total 
treatment duration of two weeks or three weeks for 
patients with mild to moderate or severe disease, 
respectively. Serious adverse events occurred in two 
patients, and both were reported in hydroxychloroquine 
recipients. The overall frequency of adverse events was 
significantly higher in hydroxychloroquine recipients 
than in non-recipients. Gastrointestinal events,

particularly diarrhoea, were most commonly reported, 
as they were in another study using a high dose of 
hydroxychloroquine.16 Transient blurred vision was 
reported in one patient whose symptoms recovered 
two days after discontinuation of hydroxychloroquine. 
Early development of retinal damage with a daily 
dose of 800 to 1200 mg was detected using sensitive 
retinal screening tests.17 Therefore, the retinal damage 
could be underestimated in our trial. Events of 
cardiac arrhythmia, such as prolonged QT interval,18
were not observed in our trial, possibly because of 
the relatively mild to moderate disease of patients 
investigated or the short term period of follow-up. 
However, with increasing interest in the combined use 
of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin worldwide, 
physicians should be cautious about the increased risk 
of prolongation of the QT interval and fatal ventricular 
arrhythmia with azithromycin and other antimicrobial 
agents.19 20 Drug-drug interaction should be taken 
into consideration when assessing safety and efficacy 
endpoints in future trials of hydroxychloroquine.10 The 
effects of hydroxychloroquine in causing increased 
concentrations of digitoxin and metoprolol would be 
particularly relevant in patients with severe covid-19 
and would therefore require close monitoring.21
Strengths and limitations of study
This study provides the first and timely evidence 
about the benefit-risk profile of hydroxychloroquine 
derived from a multicentre randomised controlled 
trial, which was started during the most challenging 
time of the covid-19 outbreak in China. In such a 
situation, our study has several limitations. Firstly, 
the open label, as opposed to double blind, design 
introduces the possibility of biased investigator 
determined assessments and unbalanced dosage 
adjustment. Urgent production of placebos 
mimicking hydroxychloroquine and the management 
of a multicentre, placebo controlled trial remain 
challenging during the pandemic. Secondly, the use 
of sequential envelopes is inferior to the interactive 
web response management system for randomisation. 
Thirdly, the setting of our trial among patients admitted 
to hospital precluded us from enrolling patients at the 
early stage of disease. In addition, we cannot provide 
evidence on the effect of hydroxychloroquine on 
disease progression or regression because 148/150 
(99%) patients in our trial had mild to moderate 
disease.
Fourthly, the results of our main prespecified 
outcomes are not entirely conclusive, being based 
on an underpowered sample size due to the lack of 
enough eligible patients to enrol. The recruitment of 
eligible patients was unexpectedly difficult, with many 
clinical trials launched in the same period in response 
to the urgent call by the national health authorities for 
the exploration of effective treatment against covid-19. 
The rapid decline in eligible new cases owing to the 
successful containment of covid-19 in the middle of 
March 2020 in China precluded further recruitment 
to reach our targeted sample size. The premature 
termination of our trial also led to increased censoring 
of data on our primary outcome. We therefore 
reanalysed the probability of negative conversion in 
the two groups by using follow-up data to 27 April 
2020 (supplementary table B), and the results were 
consistent with our reported results.
Fifthly, ensuring fidelity to the protocol by site 
investigators under highly challenging circumstances 
in the covid-19 treatment centres was difficult. Hiring 
a contract research organisation, as we did in our 
trial, can greatly support the conduct and oversight of 
trials. Sixthly, population quarantine of Wuhan and 
neighbouring cities, nationwide travel restrictions, 
and isolation of cases and contacts were also barriers 
to collecting and transferring data and paper files. 
Several prespecified secondary endpoints, including 
the changes on computed tomography of the chest, 
were therefore not finished by the cut-off date for 
analysis. Finally, the specimens collected in our trial 
for virus RNA determination were mostly from the 
upper respiratory tract rather than bronchoalveolar 
lavage fluid, which could introduce false negative 
results.22 However, the prespecified definition for 
negative conversion of virus was two consecutive 
negative results at least 24 hours apart, which can 
reduce false negativity.
Conclusion and policy implications
The results of our trial did not show additional benefits 
of virus elimination from adding hydroxychloroquine 
to the current standard of care in patients with 
mainly persistent mild to moderate covid-19. 
Adverse events, particularly gastrointestinal events, 
were more frequently reported in patients receiving 
hydroxychloroquine, who were given a loading 
dose of 1200 mg daily for three days followed by a 
maintenance dose of 800 mg daily for the remaining 
days for a total treatment duration of two weeks in 
patients with mild to moderate disease and three 
weeks in those with severe disease. Overall, these data 
do not support the addition of hydroxychloroquine to 
the current standard of care in patients with persistent 
mild to moderate covid-19 for eliminating the virus. 
Our trial may provide initial evidence for the benefit￾risk profile of hydroxychloroquine and serve as a 
resource to support further research.
