Background: Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) 2 is a recently identified homologue of ACE that may
counterregulate the actions of angiotensin (Ang) II by facilitating its breakdown to Ang 1–7. The renin￾angiotensin system (RAS) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of cirrhosis but the role of ACE2 in liver
disease is not known.
Aims: This study examined the effects of liver injury on ACE2 expression and activity in experimental
hepatic fibrosis and human cirrhosis, and the effects of Ang 1–7 on vascular tone in cirrhotic rat aorta.
Methods: In sham operated and bile duct ligated (BDL) rats, quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase
chain reaction was used to assess hepatic ACE2 mRNA, and western blotting and immunohistochemistry
to quantify and localise ACE2 protein. ACE2 activity was quantified by quenched fluorescent substrate
assay. Similar studies were performed in normal human liver and in hepatitis C cirrhosis.
Results: ACE2 mRNA was detectable at low levels in rat liver and increased following BDL (363-fold;
p,0.01). ACE2 protein increased after BDL (23.5-fold; p,0.05) as did ACE2 activity (fourfold; p,0.05).
In human cirrhotic liver, gene (.30-fold), protein expression (97-fold), and activity of ACE2 (2.4 fold)
were increased compared with controls (all p,0.01). In healthy livers, ACE2 was confined to endothelial
cells, occasional bile ducts, and perivenular hepatocytes but in both BDL and human cirrhosis there was
widespread parenchymal expression of ACE2 protein. Exposure of cultured human hepatocytes to
hypoxia led to increased ACE2 expression. In preconstricted rat aorta, Ang 1–7 alone did not affect
vascular tone but it significantly enhanced acetylcholine mediated vasodilatation in cirrhotic vessels.
Conclusions: ACE2 expression is significantly increased in liver injury in both humans and rat, possibly in
response to increasing hepatocellular hypoxia, and may modulate RAS activity in cirrhosis.
T
he main effector of the renin angiotensin system (RAS),
angiotensin (Ang) II, is a potent systemic vasoconstrictor
that plays a central role in cardiovascular homeostasis.
However, there is evidence from studies in a wide range of
organs that, in addition to its systemic effects, locally
produced Ang II contributes to tissue injury and fibrosis in
many chronic diseases. A number of studies have provided
evidence that the RAS also contributes to the pathogenesis of
chronic liver disease. There is marked upregulation of
intrahepatic RAS components in experimental injury, and
RAS inhibitors have been shown to inhibit hepatic fibrosis in
several animal models.1–4 In addition, in advanced cirrhosis
there is activation of the systemic RAS in response to
mesenteric and systemic vasodilatation. Although vasocon￾striction responses to Ang II are significantly impaired in
patients with end stage liver disease,5 this response of the
systemic RAS plays a central role in maintaining blood
pressure and renal perfusion.5 6
Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), a dipeptidyl car￾boxypeptidase, is a key enzyme in the RAS and converts Ang
I to the potent vasoconstrictor Ang II.7 ACE2 is a recently
identified homologue of ACE8 9 which unlike ACE, has only
one active enzymatic site, degrades Ang II to Ang 1–7, and
cleaves a single residue from Ang I to generate angiotensin
1–9.10 Ang 1–9 has no known effects but is converted to Ang
1–7 by ACE (fig 1).11 There is evidence that Ang 1–7 may
modulate the effects of RAS activation via several mechan￾isms, including inhibition of ACE, blockade of the AT1
receptor, and by its direct effects on vascular tone.12 Thus
ACE2 may play an important counterregulatory role to the
RAS, protecting tissues from Ang II mediated injury by both
degrading Ang II and inhibiting its production, and by
increasing production of Ang 1–7.12
ACE2 was described in the endothelium of heart, kidney,
and testis and is also detected in the normal large and small
intestine.13 Evidence for a biological role for ACE2 is provided
by studies in ACE2 knockout mice. These animals have
impaired cardiac contractility and upregulation of hypoxia
induced genes in the heart associated with impaired
degradation of Ang II,14 suggesting ACE2 is an important
regulator of cardiac function and a possible link between
ACE2 and tissue oxygenation. In experimental models of
hypertension and diabetes, renal expression of this enzyme is
reduced and this may contribute to Ang II mediated tissue
injury.14 15 ACE2 is also a functional receptor for the severe
acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, suggesting
that it may play a role in SARS infection.16 17
Although expression of ACE2 in normal human liver tissue
is low,9 the possibility that ACE2 is modulated in liver disease
has not been explored. This study examined hepatic expres￾sion of ACE2 in normal rats and in the bile duct ligated (BDL)
rat, a model of hepatic fibrosis, as well as in normal human
livers and hepatitis C cirrhotic livers removed at liver
transplantation. We also examined the possible vascular
effects of Ang1–7 in cirrhosis by studying the effects of Ang

1–7 in preconstricted aortic rings from healthy and cirrhotic
rats.
METHODS
Experimental procedures were approved by the Animal and
Human Research Ethics Committees of Austin Health and
performed according to the NHMRC of Australia Guidelines
for animal experimentation and the principles of the Helsinki
declaration. Sprague-Dawley rats (200–250 g) were housed
in a 12:12 h light-dark cycle, with ad libitum food containing
0.4–0.6% NaCl (Norco, Lismore, NSW, Australia) and water.
Animal model
Double bile duct ligation and transection were performed in
rats (n = 9), as previously described.18 Sham operated
(control) rats underwent the same surgical procedure but
the bile duct was not ligated (n = 9). At day 21, animals were
sacrificed by excision of the liver following lethal anaesthesia.
Liver tissue was fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and paraffin
embedded for immunohistochemical studies. Tissue was
frozen for quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase
chain reaction (QRT-PCR) analysis, western blotting and
measurement of ACE2 activity.
In a second group of experiments, rats were sacrificed at 7,
14, and 21 days post BDL and 21 days after sham operation
(n = 4 in each group) in order to determine the location of
ACE2 protein expression by immunohistochemistry during
the evolution of liver injury and its possible relationship to
cellular hypoxia, as assessed by immunostaining of pimoni￾dazole adducts. For these experiments, pimonidazole hydro￾chloride (Hypoxyprobe-1) was obtained from Chemicon
Australia Pty Ltd. (part No 90201, Victoria, Australia) in the
form of sealed vials containing 1.0 g of pimonidazole
hydrochloride. Prior to sacrifice, rats were anaesthetised with
an intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbitone sodium
(Nembutal), and a bolus injection of pimonidazole hydro￾chloride (80 mg/kg) dissolved in sterile 0.9% saline was
injected into the jugular vein. One hour after injection, rats
were anaesthetised again, the livers removed, fixed in 4%
paraformaldehyde phosphate buffered saline (PBS) solution,
and then embedded in paraffin.
Human liver tissue
Explanted liver tissue from patients who had undergone liver
transplantation for hepatitis C induced cirrhosis (n = 9) was
obtained at the time of transplantation and frozen for real
time QRT-PCR analysis, western blotting, and measurement
of ACE2 activity. Control livers included one donor liver, one
explant from a patient transplanted for hypercholesterol￾aemia, and one specimen from resection of a colorectal
metastasis taken well clear of the tumour margin. All three
liver samples were histologically normal and were stored in
the same manner as cirrhotic tissues. Tissue from three of the
hepatitis C cirrhotic livers and three normal livers was fixed
in 10% buffered formalin for immunohistochemical and in
situ hybridisation studies.
Isolation of total RNA and synthesis of cDNA
Total RNA was isolated from liver tissue suspensions by
homogenising with an Ultra-Turrax (Janke and Kunkel IKA,
Labortechnik, Germany) in Trizol (Invitrogen Life
Technologies, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia).15 19 cDNA was
synthesised with a reverse transcriptase reaction carried out
with the use of standard techniques (Superscript First Strand
Synthesis System for QRT-PCR; Life Technologies Inc) with
random hexamers, dNTPs, and total RNA extracted from
control and diseased livers. An aliquot of the resulting single
strand cDNA was used in the real time PCR (QRT-PCR)
experiments, as described below. To assess genomic DNA
contamination, controls without reverse transcriptase were
included.
Quantitative real time RT-PCR (QRT-PCR)
QRT-PCR is a fully quantitative method for determination of
the amounts of mRNA. Briefly, gene specific 59-oligonucleo￾tide corresponding to the human ACE (59-TGC CTA TCC TTC
CTA TAT CAG TCC AA), ACE 39-oligonucleotide primer (59-
TTG TCC AAA ATC TAC CCC ACA TAT C), and ACE probe
(FAM 59-ATG CCT CCC TGC TCA TTT GCT TGG T-TAMRA)
for rat ACE2 gene specific 59-oligonucleotide (59-GCC AGG
AGA TGA CCG GAA A), an ACE2 39-oligonucleotide primer
(59-CTG AAG TCT CCA TGT CCC AGA TC), and ACE2 probe
(FAM59-TTG TCT GCC ACC CCA CA-MGBNFQ) were
designed using the software program, Primer Express (PE
Applied Biosystems, Foster City, California, USA).
Generation of amplicons was defined by the point during
cycling when amplification of the PCR product was first
detected. The QRT-PCR reaction took place with 500 nmol/l
of forward and reverse primer and 50 nM of FAM/TAMRA
ACE/ACE2 probe and VIC/TAMRA 18S ribosomal probe, in
16Taqman universal PCR master mix (PE Biosystems). Each
sample was run and analysed in duplicate. Samples from
sham livers were used as the calibrator with a given value of 1
and the BDL groups compared with this calibrator.15 19
Western blotting
Western blotting for ACE2 was performed as previously
described.15 Liver tissue from rat and human tissue was
minced, resuspended in buffer containing 10 mM HEPES,
150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EGTA, 5 mM MgCl2, and 0.02% NaN3,
5% Triton 6100, pH 7.4, to which 0.5 mg/ml pepstatin,
0.25 mg/ml leupeptin (Sigma, St Louis, Missouri, USA),
0.1 mg/ml benzamidine, and 0.1 mg/ml bacitracin were
added, and homogenised at 13 000 rpm with the Ultra￾Turrax (Janke and Kunkel IKA) and centrifuged at 1000 g at
4˚C for 30 minutes. The resultant supernatant was harvested
and stored in aliquots at 280˚C. Samples (100 mg protein)
were loaded and run on a 10% sodium dodecyl sulphate
denaturing gel system and transblotted onto nitrocellulose
filters (Hybond P, Amersham-Pharmacia Biotech,
Buckinghamshire, UK) using a transfer tank at 15 V for
30 minutes. At the end of the transfer, filters were blocked
with 10% non-fat skim milk powder in Tris buffered saline
and 0.1% Tween (TBS/Tween) for one hour at room
temperature. The primary ACE2 antibody diluted to a
concentration of 1/5000 with 10% skim milk powder in
TBS/Tween was incubated overnight at room temperature.
The membrane was then washed thoroughly three times in
wash solution (TBS/Tween). Positive bands were developed

using the western blotting analysis system (Amersham￾Pharmacia Biotech, Buckinghamshire, UK) in which horse￾radish peroxidase labelled secondary sheep antirabbit anti￾body (Chemicon, Temecula, California, USA) was diluted at
1/2000 and incubated for one hour at room temperature.
Exposed Biomax film of bands representing ACE2 protein
were quantified on an Automated Imaging System (Imaging
Research Inc., St Catherines, Ontario, Canada).
Quenched fluorescent substrate assay of ACE2 activity
Liver homogenate (10 ml) was incubated with an ACE2
specific quenched fluorescent substrate (QFS: (7-methoxy￾coumarin-4-yl)-acetyl-Ala-Pro-Lys(2, 4-dintirophenyl));
Auspep, Parkville, Victoria, Australia), as previously
described,20 in duplicate. Assays were performed in black
96 well microtitre plates with 50 mM QFS in a final volume of
200 ml per well ACE2 assay buffer (100 mM Tris, 1 M NaCl,
pH 6.5). Final concentration of DMSO (used to solubilise
QFS) was 0.7%. Reactions proceeded at 37˚C for 30 minutes
within a thermostat fMax fluorescence microplate reader
(Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, California, USA), prior to
reading the liberated fluorescence (lex = 320 nm,
lem = 420 nm). Cleavage of QFS was attributed to ACE2
by the use of a specific inhibitor (S,S) 2-(1-carboxy-2-[3-(3,5-
dichloro-benzyl)-3H-imidazol-4-yl]-ethylamino)-4-methyl￾pentanoic acid (MLN-4760; a generous gift from Dr Natalie
Dales, Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge,
Massachusetts, USA.) at 1 mM final concentration.21 As QFS
can be cleaved by prolyl endopeptidase, a specific inhibitor of
this enzyme, Z-Pro-prolinal (10 mM), was included in all
wells. The specific activity of the preparations was expressed
as units of fluorescence/mg membrane protein/h.
Immunohistochemistry
Immunohistochemical studies for ACE2 were performed as
previously described on 4 mm sections of paraffin embedded
liver (human and rat) tissue mounted on silane coated
slides.15 Slides were dewaxed in histolene and hydrated in
graded ethanol, and endogenous peroxidase activity was
removed by treating sections with 3% hydrogen peroxide in
PBS for 20 minutes. The primary antibody to ACE2 (donated
by Dr S Acton, Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge,
Boston, Massachusetts, USA) was applied at room tempera￾ture for one hour to slides15 with a dilution of 1:500 for rat
sections and 1:800 for human sections. Specific staining in
human sections was detected using the standard ABC
(avidin-biotin complex) method. Slides were incubated for
20 minutes with the secondary antibody (biotin conjugated
goat antirabbit IgG; Dako, Copenhagen, Denmark) at a
concentration of 1/250. The avidin-biotin Vectastain ABC
system (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, California, USA)
was applied for 20 minutes. For rat sections, specific staining
was detected using Zymed SuperPicTure polymer detection
kit. Slides were incubated with antirabbit horseradish
peroxidase polymer for 15 minutes. The final detection step
for all slides was carried out using 3,39-diaminobenzidine
(Sigma) as the chromogen. Sections were counterstained
with haematoxylin. Three types of control tests were
performed to determine the specificity of the antibody.
Firstly, control sections were incubated with anti-ACE2
antibody solutions which had been preabsorbed with the
synthetic peptide to which the antibody was raised (peptide
sequence: NTNITEENVQNMNNAGDKW aa 51–69); secondly,
sections were incubated with rabbit non-immune serum; and
thirdly, sections were incubated with PBS without the
primary antibodies. These control sections did not reveal
any staining (see fig 4A).
Immunostaining for pimonidazole binding was performed
on sections (4 mm) from formalin fixed paraffin embedded
liver samples following the manufacturer’s instructions
(Chemicon International). Briefly, sections were deparaffi￾nised, rehydrated, and incubated with 3% aqueous hydrogen
peroxide for five minutes at room temperature to inactivate
endogenous peroxidase. After antigen retrieval by Pronase
digestion for 40 minutes at 40˚C, the primary monoclonal
antibody (Hypoxyprobe-1Mab1; Chemicon Australia Pty Ltd,
part No 90204) for pimonidazole adducts at a dilution of 1:50
was applied for 40 minutes at room temperature. Biotin￾conjugated F(c) secondary goat antimouse antibody (Sigma￾Aldrich Pty Ltd, Sydney, Australia), at a dilution of 1:500,
was then applied for 10 minutes at room temperature
followed by incubation with the avidin-biotin Vectastain
ABC system (Vector Laboratories) for 10 minutes at room
temperature. Positive signals were detected by incubation of
the tissue sections with DAB chromogen for 10 minutes at
room temperature. Sections were counterstained with hae￾matoxylin for 15 seconds and mounted. As a negative
control, normal goat serum was used instead of primary
antibody.
Effects of hypoxia on ACE2 expression in cultured
hepatocytes
The human hepatoma cell line HepG2 was obtained from the
ATCC. Cell culture media and supplements were purchased
from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, California, USA). Cells were
seeded at a density of approximately 105 cells per 10 cm
diameter culture dish in 10 ml MEM supplemented with 10%
heat inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 U/ml penicillin, and
0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, and grown to confluence at 37˚C in
a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% carbon dioxide.
When cultures reached confluence, the culture medium
was removed and replaced with fresh medium. Cells were
then incubated in a sealed container (AnaeroPack,
Mitsubishi Gas Chemical Co., Japan) under either normal
(room air, n = 5 replicate experiments) or hypoxic conditions
using the AnaeroGen system (AnaeroGen, Oxoid, Hants, UK)
as previously described.22 After 2, 4, or 6 hours of hypoxia
(n = 6 replicate experiments in each group), the culture
medium was removed from replicate cultures and cell
monolayers rinsed briefly with PBS before storage at 270˚C
for later analysis.
Vascular responses to Ang 1–7
These studies were performed in vessels from Sprague￾Dawley rats, four weeks after undergoing bile duct ligation,
and in age and sex matched controls using previously
described techniques.23 Briefly, animals were sacrificed and
the thoracic aorta removed and cleaned of connective tissue
and fat. Rings were cut into 3 mm segments and placed
between two metal hooks in an organ bath chamber (six
rings). The chambers were kept at a constant 37˚C and
continuously bubbled with carbogen. Rings were left to
equilibrate for one hour with no tension, and then the
tension was progressively increased to 1 g. After this, rings
were allowed to equilibrate for 30 minutes and then the
maximum contraction was obtained by incubating the
vessels with a high potassium solution (K+ = 124 mM).
After the contraction reached a plateau, vessels were rinsed
with Krebs three times (10 minute intervals) and allowed to
rest for one hour. Vessels were then contracted to 30–50% of
maximum with phenylephrine.
In an initial study, vessels were then exposed to increasing
concentrations of Ang 1–7 (1028
–1025
) at one minute
intervals over 10 minutes. In a second study, after vessels
reached a plateau, 1026 Ang(1–7) was added to every second
bath. After one minute, increasing concentrations (1028
–
1025
) of acetylcholine (Ach) were added to all baths, at half
log concentrations only after each vasorelaxation had

measuring the change in tension from the initial contraction

Statistics
All data are shown as mean (SEM) unless otherwise
specified. Data were analysed by the Mann-Whitney U test.
A p value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically
significant.
RESULTS
Hepatic fibrosis in the BDL model
Light microscopy of haematoxylin and eosin stained liver
sections from 21 day BDL animals showed extensive fibrosis,
bile duct proliferation, and nodular transformation without
cirrhosis.
Human liver histology
All livers had established hepatitis C related cirrhosis with
varying degrees of inflammatory activity and no evidence of
other chronic liver diseases.
ACE2 expression and activity in rat tissue

low levels of ACE2 protein in control livers which increased
23.5-fold following bile duct ligation (p,0.05) (fig 2B, 2C).
The increase in ACE2 expression was associated with a
fourfold increase in ACE2 enzyme activity in BDL livers
compared with controls (p,0.05) (fig 2D).
ACE2 protein and activity in human liver
As in rat liver, ACE2 mRNA was detectable at low levels in
healthy livers. ACE2 mRNA levels were upregulated 34-fold
in hepatitis C induced cirrhotic liver tissue compared with
controls (p,0.01) (fig 3A). This was associated with a 97-fold
increase in ACE2 protein by western blotting (p,0.01)
(fig 3B, C) while ACE2 activity was increased 2.4-fold
compared with controls (p,0.01) (fig 3D).
Localisation of ACE2 expression and pimonidazole
staining
Immunohistochemistry demonstrated that in livers from
sham operated control rats, only a small percentage of cells
expressed ACE2 protein and this was almost entirely
confined to perivenular hepatocytes (fig 4B). In these livers,
hypoxia was detected by the presence of pimonidazole adduct
staining in a perivenular pattern affecting the last row of
perivenular hepatocytes, similar to that seen for ACE2
immunolabelling (fig 4C). In livers from animals that were
studied at seven days post BDL (fig 4D), ACE2 expression
was markedly increased, involving 30–40% of cells in each
lobule. However, the strongest labelling was still seen in
perivenular cells (fig 4D). At 14 days post BDL there was a
further increase in ACE2 staining. At 21 days there was very
widespread ACE2 expression, with staining identified in
more than 80% of hepatocytes as well as bile duct epithelial
and endothelial cells (fig 4E). In these livers, pimonidazole
adducts were detected in most hepatocytes in keeping with
the pattern of ACE2 expression (fig 4E, F).
In normal human liver, ACE2 staining was minimal and
confined to occasional bile duct cells, vascular endothelium,
and perivenular hepatocytes (fig 4G). In contrast, in cirrhotic
human liver, ACE2 was detected in most hepatocytes within
cirrhotic nodules, as well as bile duct cells and vascular
endothelial cells (fig 4H, I).
Effects of hypoxia on ACE2 expression in hepatocytes
Expression of ACE2 mRNA in HepG2 cells cultured under
normoxic (room air) and hypoxic conditions was assessed
by QRT-PCR. ACE2 expression was significantly higher in
cells incubated under hypoxic conditions and increased
with duration of hypoxia (1.69-fold increase at two hours,
Figure 4 Immunohistochemical staining of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) protein in rat and human liver. In rat liver, pimonidazole
immunostaining was used as a marker of cellular hypoxia. Normal rat liver is shown in the top row (A–C). There was no hepatic ACE2 staining
detectable following ACE2 peptide preabsorption (A), confirming the specificity of the antibody used to detect ACE2. In normal livers. ACE2
immunolabelling (B) and staining of pimonidazole adducts (C, arrow) were restricted to perivenular hepatocytes. Bile duct ligated (BDL) rat livers are
shown in the second row (D–F). In rat livers at seven days post BDL (D), ACE2 expression was more heterogenous and widespread than in normal
livers. At 21 days post BDL, immunostaining of both ACE2 (E) and pimonidazole adducts (F) was detected in more than 80% of hepatocytes, with ACE2
also detected in bile duct cells and endothelial cells. (G–I) Human liver. In normal liver, ACE2 was detected in hepatocytes surrounding occasional
larger central veins (G, arrow). In cirrhotic liver, there was widespread ACE2 expression throughout cirrhotic nodules (H) and in bile duct cells (BD) and
endothelial cells lining small blood vessels (BV) (I). Original magnifications 6850, except (4G) and (4H) 6450, and (4I) 61700.

produced significant vasodilatation in both healthy and
cirrhotic rat vessels (fig 5). However, while Ang 1–7 had no
effect on the response to Ach in normal vessels, it enhanced
Ach mediated vasodilatation in cirrhotic vessels (p,0.05).
DISCUSSION
Although ACE2 expression is low in normal liver tissue,9 13
the results of this study show that in rat and human liver
disease there is major upregulation of hepatic ACE2 at the
gene and protein levels, accompanied by significant increases
in ACE2 activity. These findings demonstrate that chronic
liver injury causes a major increase in the hepatic expression
of ACE2 and raise the possibility that it may play a role in
disease pathogenesis.
Evidence to date has indicated that in normal physiology
expression of ACE2 is more restricted than ACE, and is
localised to the heart, kidney,9 testis,8 and large and small
intestine.13 With the use of highly sensitive QRT-PCR
techniques, low levels of ACE2 mRNA have been detected
in the normal human liver13 and this is consistent with our
own findings in control rodent and human liver. We have
previously shown in the BDL liver that ACE protein was
abundant in proliferating bile duct epithelial cells, consistent
with studies in the kidney which identified epithelial cells as
a major site of both ACE and ACE2 expression.15 However,
the current study has demonstrated that ACE2 is also
strongly expressed in hepatocytes in this model of chronic
liver injury. Whether these patterns of upregulation of ACE
and ACE2 are specific to the BDL model is unknown, and
expression of the RAS in other models of experimental
hepatic fibrosis deserves study. However, our findings in
human hepatitis C induced cirrhotic liver suggest that a
widespread increase in ACE2 expression may be a general
feature of liver injury in both rats and humans.
To date, there are few reports addressing ACE2 expression
in other disease states. The first by Crackower et al showed
that ACE2 mRNA and protein levels were downregulated in
rat models of hypertension.14 Furthermore, in the same study,
the finding that the ACE2 knockout mouse developed
impaired cardiac function lends credence to the hypothesis
that this enzyme is a critical regulator of cardiac function. A
second study demonstrated that ACE2 gene and protein
expression are reduced in the kidney in experimental
diabetes and that this paralleled changes in ACE expression.15
It has been postulated that ACE2 may function in conjunc￾tion with ACE to regulate the generation and degradation of
angiotensin peptides, including Ang I, Ang II, Ang 1–9, and
Ang 1–7.12 This is supported by the finding that tissue Ang II
levels are significantly increased in ACE2 knockout mice,14
and suggests that ACE and ACE2 have counterregulatory
functions.
The finding that in the hearts of ACE2 knockout mice
elevation of Ang II levels is associated with upregulation of
hypoxia inducible genes14 indicates that an important role of
ACE2 may be to maintain local tissue perfusion and
oxygenation, and to reduce Ang II mediated vasoconstriction.
The concept that ACE2 may be upregulated in response to
tissue hypoxia is supported by our recent finding that ACE2
expression is increased in response to myocardial ischaemia.19
Our findings in the liver are also consistent with this idea, as
ACE2 expression in normal livers was largely restricted to
perivenular hepatocytes, the cells of the lobule exposed to the
lowest oxygen tension. As has been previously shown,22 the
presence of hypoxia in these cells was confirmed by
pimonidazole staining. There is considerable evidence that
hepatic fibrogenesis is associated with progressive impair￾ment of hepatocellular oxygenation, with the likely causes
including sinusoidal capillarisation, intrahepatic shunting,
vasoconstriction, and disruption of sinusoidal flow. As has
been previously demonstrated, in our study there was
extensive staining of pimonidazole adducts in fibrotic livers,
indicating the development of widespread hepatocellular
hypoxia that may be a stimulus for increased ACE2
production. Consistent with this hypothesis, we found that
in HepG2 cells, ACE2 mRNA expression progressively rose in
response to increasing periods of hypoxia. Using a similar
experimental approach, Corpechot et al demonstrated a
similar degree of upregulation of the hypoxia inducible
growth factor vascular endothelial growth factor in hypoxic
isolated rat hepatocytes.22
However, in the BDL liver, as with other models of tissue
injury,7 there is a general increase in expression of ACE and
other RAS components.2 Upregulation of ACE2 and its
widespread expression throughout the liver in BDL may
therefore represent a more general counterregulatory
response to increased ACE levels and the multiple deleterious
effects of increased local Ang II production. ACE2 upregula￾tion may also contribute to the vasodilatation of cirrhosis by
degrading Ang II, and this may help explain why vasocon￾strictor responses to Ang II are impaired5 and vasodilatation
persists in patients with advanced liver disease despite
activation of the systemic RAS.5 6 In addition, ACE2 generates
Ang 1–7, and this peptide may reduce Ang II production by
inhibiting ACE and reduce Ang II mediated vasoconstriction
by blocking AT1 receptors.24 It has also been shown that, in
some tissues, Ang 1–7 may act as a potent vasodilator.12 Our
study has confirmed that in both rat and human liver there is
increased ACE2 expression and enzyme activity that would
be expected to facilitate the degradation of Ang II and the
formation of Ang 1–7. We also found that while in the rat
aorta Ang 1–7 had no measurable effects on vascular tone, it
enhanced Ach mediated vasodilatation in vessels from
cirrhotic rats. Possible mechanisms for this effect include
enhanced prostanoid release from vascular smooth muscle
cells and direct stimulation of nitric oxide synthesis.25–27 These
vascular effects of Ang 1–7 suggest a further mechanism by
which ACE2 might contribute to altered vascular tone in
cirrhosis.
ACE2 is also a functional receptor for the SARS coronavirus
and plays an important role in SARS infection. Liver

impairment is common in patients with SARS, and it has
been recently shown that the SARS coronavirus causes a
distinctive hepatitis characterised by lobular inflammation
and hepatocyte apoptosis.28 Our finding that the major
cellular receptor for SARS is present in the liver and is
increased in liver injury provides a potential explanation for
the finding that SARS infects the liver.
Recent research has been directed towards the importance
of the RAS in the development of hepatic fibrosis4 and the
potential benefits of modulation of this system either by ACE
inhibition or Ang receptor antagonism.2 3 The finding of
major upregulation of ACE2 in the BDL rat and cirrhotic
human liver provides further insight into the complexities of
the RAS and its regulation in liver injury. In the future, the
development of specific modulators of ACE2 activity and
function will help determine the role of ACE2 in the
pathophysiology of liver disease.
