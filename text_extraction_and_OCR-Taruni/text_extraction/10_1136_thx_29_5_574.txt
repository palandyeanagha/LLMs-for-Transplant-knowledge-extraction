Abstract
Skinner, C. and Palmer, K.N.V. (1974).Thorax, 29, 574-577.
Changes in specific airways conductance and forced expiratory


volume in one second after a bronchodilator in normal subjects
and patients with airways obstruction. Specific conductance
(SGaw) and the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1)
were measured in 10 normal, 10 asthmatic, and 10 obstructive
bronchitic subjects before and after aerosol salbutamol. Mean SGaw
increased by 37% in normals, by 109% in asthmatics, and by 38%
in obstructive bronchitics. Mean FEV1 increased by 2% in normals,
by 32% in asthmatics, and by 12% in obstructive bronchitics. SGaw
appears to be a more sensitive indicator than FEV1 of changes in
airways calibre following a bronchodilator drug in normal subjects,
but FEV1 is as good an indicator of these changes as SGaw in
patients with airways obstruction.
