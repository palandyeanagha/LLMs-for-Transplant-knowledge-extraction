Summary
Heart transplantation (HTx) is an established therapy for stage D heart failure due to recent advances in immuno￾suppressive regimens. However, antibody-mediated rejection remains an unsolved problem because of its refractoriness 
to standard immunosuppressive therapy with high mortality and graft loss. We experienced a 16-year old patient with 
hemodynamic compromise caused by both cellular and antibody-mediated rejection 12 years after HTx. The rejection 
was refractory to repeated steroid pulse treatment, intravenous immunoglobulin administration, and intensifying immu￾nosuppression including addition of everolimus. Eventually, she was successfully treated with repeated plasma exchange 
accompanied by a single administration of the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab. (Int Heart J 2013; 54: 328-
331)

Recent advances in immunosuppressive therapy have 
greatly improved the outcome of heart transplantation 
(HTx) in stage D heart failure (HF) patients. Cellular 
rejection (CR), which is mainly mediated by T-cells, accounts 
for the majority of allograft rejection episodes after HTx.1) CR 
has become controlled to a considerable extent by current im￾munosuppressive regimens that are designed to target T-cell 
immune function. On the other hand, antibody-mediated rejec￾tion (AMR) after HTx has long been an unsolved problem be￾cause few schemes for the treatment of B cell-driven AMR 
have been established.2) Circulating antibodies mediate rejec￾tion through complement activation and fixation on graft en￾dothelium, thereby contributing to both early and late graft 
loss, cardiac allograft vasculopathy, and higher mortality.3,4)
Recently, rituximab, a chimeric anti-CD20 monoclonal anti￾body that binds to the antigen expressed on B-cells, has been 
effective for AMR in several case reports though it is still off￾label.5-7) AMR usually occurs early after HTx, and reports of it 
occurring a long time after HTx are rare. We experienced a pa￾tient with acute decompensated HF caused by CR and AMR 
simultaneously 12 years after HTx, which might be attributable 
to poor adherence to medication. The rejection was successful￾ly treated by plasma exchange (PE) and a single administration 
of rituximab.
Case Report
In August 2000, a 4-year old Japanese female with dilated 
cardiomyopathy underwent HTx in the United States. Her 
postoperative course was uneventful, and she was followed at 
other hospitals near Tokyo. Her last endomyocardial biopsy in 
2010 showed no rejection and echocardiography revealed pre￾served ejection fraction.
In July 2012, 12 years after the HTx, she presented with 
acute decompensated HF with New York Heart Association 
class IV symptoms accompanied by orthopnea, and she was 
referred to our hospital for the first time. We started treatment 
of the acute HF as shown in Figure 1. Maintenance immuno￾suppressive therapy before admission included 6.5 mg/day of 
tacrolimus and 10 mg/day of azathioprine. The low trough lev￾el of tacrolimus (2.9 μg/L) on admission suggested her poor 
adherence to recent medication. Her height was 150 cm and 
body mass index was 24.8. The ejection fraction on transtho￾racic echocardiography using Simpson’s biplane method was 
25% with a left ventricular diastolic diameter of 47 mm. The 
ratio of early diastolic filling velocity to early mitral lateral an￾nulus velocity was 36.8, and the deceleration time was 86 
msec. Serum creatinine concentration was 1.07 mg/dL and the 
plasma level of B-type natriuretic peptide was 1646 pg/mL. 
Cytomegalovirus antigenemia was negative. According to the 
results of the hemodynamic study at day 1, central venous

pressure was 16 mmHg, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure 
was 29 mmHg, and cardiac index was 1.49 L/minute/m2
 (Ta￾ble). Coronary angiography did not show any evidence of car￾diac allograft vasculopathy. An endomyocardial biopsy at day 
1 showed CR at ISHLT grade 3R and positive staining of com￾plement component C4d on the endothelium of capillaries 
(Figure 2).
After several manipulations aimed at overcoming the re￾jection, including initiation of everolimus, methylprednisolone 
pulse therapy (twice), and the administration of intravenous 
immunoglobulin (IVIg), myocardial injury with lymphocyte 
invasion gradually recovered, but her hemodynamic status had 
worsened on day 8 (Table). Because of severe lung congestion 
and renal dysfunction, she eventually needed continuous he￾modiafiltration under respiratory ventilatory support on day 
14. After determining that the serum level of panel reactive an￾tibody (PRA) was 52.1%, we performed 8 consecutive ses￾sions of plasma exchange (PE), accompanied by a single ad￾ministration of rituximab at a dose of 500 mg (equivalent to 
375 mg/m2
) on day 22. Her %B-cell and %PRA levels de￾creased dramatically by day 25 and remained at low levels 
without any need for additional PE and rituximab administra￾tion. No side effects such as hypotension, anaphylactic reac￾tions, or infections occurred after rituximab treatment.
Her cardiac function and hemodynamic status had im￾proved remarkably by day 38 (Table). Repeated endomyocar￾dial biopsy showed recovery of CR and C4d stain turned nega￾tive. With significant recovery of her exercise tolerance, she 
was discharged on day 130.
Discussion
Antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) remains an un￾solved clinical problem because of the difficulties in diagnosis 
and treatment.2) A consensus conference in 2010 defined AMR 
as a pathologic entity, ie, histologic findings including en￾dothelial cell swelling, accumulation of intravascular macro￾phages, interstitial edema or hemorrhage, and presence of neu￾trophils around capillaries.8) Immunofluorescent or immuno￾histochemical findings include deposition of immunoglobulin, 
complement, and identification of macrophages within capil￾laries.9) Using these criteria, a current recommendation catego￾rizes AMR on a scale from 0 to 3.10) The present case was as￾signed to pAMR 3 considering immunopathologic and 
histopathologic evidence for severe AMR.
Another diagnosis regarding clinical features is based on 
a triad of the following, (1) clinical evidence of allograft dys￾function, (2) serological evidence of donor specific antibodies 
(DSA) or high %PRA level, and (3) aforementioned endomyo￾cardial biopsy features.11) Unfortunately, donor information 
about human leukocyte antigen (HLA) was not available be￾cause she had received HTx abroad several years previously, 
but the high titer of %PRA might represent the existence of 
DSA.

HTx, typically within a few months after the implantation.12)
Therefore, our case had an unusual onset. A recent study re￾ported that late AMR occurring more than 1 year after HTx 
due to newly-developed DSA was uncommon but a serious 
problem with 46% of persistent cardiac dysfunction and 1.3 
years of mean survival after diagnosis of AMR.11) Though dis￾tinct risk factors for late AMR have remained unknown thus 
far, her adherence to immunosuppressive medicine was proba￾bly poor considering the very low level of tacrolimus at the 
time of admission. Poor adherence to medication is common 
among recipients when they become a teenager.13) Further￾more, a biopsy-free period of more than 2 years might have re￾sulted in overlooking rejection until hemodynamic compro￾mise emerged. A high %PRA level at the time of HTx is 
obviously one of the risk factors for AMR,3) but %PRA had 
not been assayed before the admission to our hospital.
At present, the management of AMR is not standardized, 
or the optimal surveillance, treatment, and timing of interven￾tion are undefined.1) Current options for treatment of AMR in￾clude steroid pulse therapy, PE, IVIg administration, and inten￾sifying immunosuppression.12) Desensitization or reduction of 
circulating HLA antibody is the essence of the above-men￾tioned treatment. In the present case, the first 3 sessions of PE 
were effective at achieving a considerable reduction of %PRA, 
but %PRA soon became elevated again so we decided to ad￾minister rituximab together with successive PE sessions.
Rituximab is a chimeiric humanized monoclonal anti￾body directed against the pan B-cell surface molecule CD20, 
and enhances lysis of CD20-positive B-cells, deleting them 
from peripheral circulation, lymph nodes, and bone marrow.5)
It has been approved for the treatment of lymphoma. Recently, 
there have been several case reports in which rituximab was 
found to be effective for the treatment of AMR, though still 
off-label.5-7,11) T-cells are unaffected by rituximab, and as a 
consequence opportunistic infection rarely occurs in associa￾tion with its administration.7) A single administration of rituxi￾mab was enough to manage %PRA and %B-cell count at low 
levels in our case, and histological findings for rejection imme￾diately disappeared along with marked improvement in cardiac 
function.
In the present case, we prioritized the treatment for CR 
because the histological finding of CR was so apparent in the 
first endomyocardial biopsy, and therefore the treatment for 
AMR was belated after confirming the refractoriness to the 
treatment for CR. Her hemodynamics collapsed during the 
treatment for CR, and she eventually needed continuous hemo￾diafiltration under respiratory ventilatory support. We were 
confronted with difficulty constructing an optimal therapeutic 
strategy because there were virtually no reports indicating that 
AMR emerged together with CR at a point in time long after 
HTx, but her cardiac function might have recovered much 
sooner if the treatment for AMR including PE and rituximab 
was initiated together with the treatment for CR. Therefore, we 
believe the case was worth reporting in order to make informed
