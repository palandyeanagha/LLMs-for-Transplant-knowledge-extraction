he outcome of solid-organ transplantation (eg, kidney 
or heart) has improved dramatically over the past 20 
years, because of advancements in immunosuppres￾sive therapy and improvements in surgical techniques. More 
than 3,000 heart transplants are performed annually world￾wide,1 with a 1-year survival in adults of nearly 90%. How￾ever, survival falls to 50–55% by 10 years.1
Cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV), a type of cardiovas￾cular disease that occurs uniquely in heart transplant recipi￾ents, is a rapidly progressive form of atherosclerosis. The 
disease is characterized in its early stages by intimal prolif￾eration, and in the later stages by luminal stenosis of epicar￾dial branches, occlusion of smaller arteries and myocardial 
infarction.2 CAV is a major factor limiting the long-term 
survival of heart transplant recipients.1,3 Because the heart is 
partially denervated after heart transplantation, the patient 
most often fails to present ischemic symptoms until conges￾tive heart failure or sudden death because of life-threatening 
arrhythmia occurs.4,5 Therefore, most institutions screen heart 
transplant recipients annually using conventional coronary 
angiography (CCAG), which demonstrates the prevalence of 
CAV to be 40–50% within 5 years of transplantation.6 CAV 
is often diffuse and concentric in nature, which is significant￾ly different from the focal and eccentric pattern of atheroscle￾rotic coronary artery disease (CAD).5,7 Because CCAG only 
shows luminal changes and the arterial wall is not directly 
visualized,5,7 it can be difficult to detect CAV by CCAG only. 
Additional intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) can provide 
great detail regarding mural changes, and has recently been 
recognized as the most sensitive tool for early detection of 
CAV.5,7,8 IVUS detects CAV in 75% of patients at 3 years 
following transplantation;7 however, it is not widely used 
because it is invasive, has a high risk of complications, and 
cannot be performed in small or distal vessels.8

Background:  Cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) is a major complication that limits the long-term survival
of recipients of heart transplants. In the present study the feasibility of 2 noninvasive approaches for detecting
CAV (multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) and whole-heart magnetic resonance coronary angiography
(MRCA)) was compared with conventional coronary angiography (CCAG).
Methods and Results:  Of 22 heart transplant recipients who underwent CCAG screening, 13 had only MDCT,
16 had only MRCA, and 7 had both noninvasive modalities. The coronary arterial tree was divided into 9 seg￾ments. Detection of vasculopathy by coronary segments was compared between 16-/64-detector computed
tomography (CT) or MRCA and CCAG. The sensitivity of both 16- and 64-detector CT for diagnosing CAV was
69.6%, and specificity was 96.8%. The sensitivity and specificity by 64-detector CT alone were 90.0% and 97.5%,
respectively; its positive and negative predictive values were 81.8% and 98.7% respectively. For MRCA, sensi￾tivity was 60%, specificity, 100%, positive predictive value, 100% and negative predictive value, 92.2%. MRCA
showed no false positives.
Conclusions:  MDCT, especially 64-detector CT, is feasible for detecting CAV, whereas MRCA currently shows
limited sensitivity.   (Circ J 2010; 74: 946–953)

Cardiac Allograft Vasculopathy by MDCT and MRCA
Studies have described multidetector computed tomog￾raphy (MDCT) as a useful noninvasive alternative to both 
CCAG and IVUS for detecting CAV in heart transplant 
recipients, because this technique takes advantage of tech￾nological advances that enable it to have high spatial and 
temporal resolution with regard to both luminal and mural 
changes in coronary vessels.5,8–11
Over the past decade, magnetic resonance coronary angi￾ography (MRCA) has also evolved as a potential alternative 
to CCAG among patients with suspected anomalous CAD and 
coronary artery aneurysms. MRCA has 2 main advantages: 
neither radiation exposure nor administration of nephrotoxic 
contrast medium is required.12 The whole-heart, 3-dimension￾al (D), steady-state free precession (SSFP) technique, dif￾ferent from earlier methods of MRCA, is currently widely 
used, and has been well-validated for assessing patients with 
CAD.13 The technique provides superior signal-to-noise and 
contrast-to-noise ratios, decreases dependence on the inflow 
of unsaturated protons, and facilitates multiplanar reconstruc￾tions. However, the feasibility of this whole-heart technique 
for detecting CAV has not been reported.
Our aim in this study was to assess the feasibility of MDCT 
and whole-heart MRCA for detecting and evaluating CAV 
in heart transplant recipients, using CCAG as the reference 
method.
Methods
Patients
Between December 2003 and July 2007, 22 consecutive heart 
transplant recipients (17 men, 5 women; 13–57 years old, 
mean, 34.9±15.7 years at the examination) underwent MDCT 
and/or whole-heart MRCA, in addition to CCAG, as screen￾ing examinations for detecting CAV. The underlying diseases 
were dilated cardiomyopathy in 14 patients, restrictive cardio￾myopathy in 5, and dilated phase of hypertrophic cardiomyop￾athy in 3; 13 patients underwent MDCT; 16 had whole-heart 
MRCA, and the other 7 underwent both MDCT and whole￾heart MRCA. Of those patients who underwent MDCT, 3 
underwent 16-detector computed tomography (CT) and 10 
underwent 64-detector CT. All gave written informed consent.
CCAG
Invasive CCAG was performed by experienced cardiologists 
using standard techniques, and the angiograms were visually 
interpreted by the same cardiologists, who were unaware of 
the findings of MDCT or whole-heart MRCA.
The coronary tree was divided into 9 segments for analy￾sis: left main stem; proximal left anterior descending (LAD); 
middle LAD; distal LAD; proximal left circumflex (LCX); 
distal LCX; proximal right coronary artery (RCA); middle 
RCA; and distal RCA. Findings in the first diagonal branch 
were evaluated with those of the middle LAD, and in the 
second diagonal branch, with those of the distal LAD. The 
obtuse marginal branches were assessed together with the 
distal LCX. Only vessels >1.5mm in diameter were evalu￾ated in the present study.
Each coronary segment was visually assessed and graded 
on a 3-step severity scale: no disease, wall thickening, and 
stenosis. Wall thickening was defined as an irregularity in 
the arterial wall or luminal narrowing without significant 
stenosis (≤50% in diameter), and stenosis was defined as 
significant arterial stenosis (>50% in diameter) or occlusion. 
The presence of CAV was established if the segment was 
classified as either wall thickening or stenosis.
MDCT
Of the 13 patients who underwent CT coronary angiogra￾phy with retrospective ECG-gated helical scan, 3 were on a 
16-detector scanner (Lightspeed Ultra 16; GE Healthcare, 
Milwaukee, WI, USA) and 10 were on a 64-detector scanner 
(LightSpeed VCT; GE Healthcare). Scan parameters for 
16-detector CT were as follows: individual detector width, 
0.625mm; gantry rotation time, 500ms; tube voltage, 120kV; 
tube current, 400mA. For 64-detector CT, the respective 
parameters were: 0.625mm, 350ms, 120 kV, and 700mA.
Unlike most patients undergoing CT coronary angiogra￾phy at our institution, the transplant patients were not given
β-blockers, because the denervated transplant heart shows 
regular R-R intervals on ECG. All patients were administered 
sublingual nitroglycerin (0.3mg: Nitropen; Nippon Kayaku, 
Tokyo, Japan) before acquisition of noncontrast localization 
images. Thereafter, CT coronary angiography was performed 
after intravenous administration of nonionic iodine contrast 
medium, iopamidol (Iopamiron; Bayer HealthCare, Osaka, 
Japan), with an iodine concentration of 370mgI/ml; a delay 
was calculated during the timing bolus scan. For 16-detector 
CT scanning, a bolus of 86–115ml contrast medium was in￾jected at a flow rate of 3.5–4.5ml/s, followed by a 30–50-ml 
saline bolus at a flow rate of 4.5ml/s. For 64-detector CT 
scanning, a bolus of 0.7ml/kg body weight contrast medium 
was injected for 12 s, followed by a 30-ml saline bolus for 
12s. After scanning, axial images were reconstructed using 
retrospective ECG-gating in multiple phases, covering the 
cardiac cycle in increments of 10% of the R-R interval.
The reformatted images were then transferred to a work￾station (Advantage Workstation version 4.3; GE Healthcare) 
for post-processing and analysis by 2 experienced radiol￾ogists who were unaware of the findings of CCAG and any 
findings of whole-heart MRCA. Analysis used the same 
classification of coronary segments as for CCAG. The visual 
assessment of each segment was graded on a similar severity 
scale to that for CCAG, and the presence of CAV was diag￾nosed by the same criteria as for CCAG.
Whole-Heart MRCA
Following sublingual administration of 0.3mg of nitroglyc￾erin (Nitropen), 16 patients underwent noncontrast whole￾heart MRCA. Each patient was placed in the supine position 
with anteriorly placed ECG leads in a 1.5-Tesla magnetic 
resonance scanner (Avanto; Siemens Medical Systems, 
Erlangen, Germany). The phased-array body coil was placed 
anteriorly and the spine coil posteriorly. The transplant 
patients were not given β-blockers prior to this procedure. 
An ECG-gated, 3-D, segmented SSFP (True FISP) sequence 
was used in combination with free-breathing, prospective 
navigator gating without tracking of the imaged volume 
position, T2 preparation to suppress myocardial signal, and a 
chemical shift-selective technique to suppress the signal from 
surrounding epicardial fat. The following scan parameters 
were used: field of view, 20×20cm; matrix, 192×192; slice 
thickness, 1.5mm (no gaps); voxel size, approximately 1.0×
1.0×1.5mm3; repetition time, 3.0ms; echo time, 1.5ms; flip 
angle, 90 degrees. The scanned images were analyzed, using 
the same classification of coronary segments as for CCAG, 
by an experienced radiologist who was unaware of the find￾ings of CCAG and any findings of MDCT. As stated in the 
MDCT section, each segment was visually assessed and 
graded on a severity scale similar to that used for CCAG, 
and the presence of CAV was diagnosed by the same criteria 
as for CCAG.

Data Analysis
For each patient, the severity grade of each of the 9 coronary 
segments assessed by MDCT and whole-heart MRCA was 
compared with those assessed by CCAG, which served as 
the reference. Furthermore, we compared the presence of 
CAV in each segment detected by MDCT and whole-heart 
MRCA with that detected by CCAG. From the data obtained, 
we calculated the sensitivity, specificity, and positive and 
negative predictive values of CAV detection per segment by 
MDCT and whole-heart MRCA.
Results
Of 22 patients who underwent CCAG, 7 underwent both 
MDCT and whole-heart MRCA, 6 had MDCT alone; and 
9 had whole-heart MRCA alone.
CAV was detected in 39 of 198 segments (19.7%) by 
CCAG, comprising 14 in proximal segments, 9 in middle 
and 16 in distal segments (Table 1). CAV was detected in 19 
of 117 segments by MDCT (16.2%), comprising 12 in proxi￾mal segments, 4 in middle and 3 in distal segments (Table 1). 
CAV was detected in 15 of 144 segments by whole-heart 
MRCA (10.4%), comprising 6 in proximal segments, 4 in 
middle and 5 in distal segments (Table 1).
Correlation of the grading of CAV between CCAG and 
16- and 64-detector CT is shown in Table 2. The sensitivity 
of 16- and 64-detector CT for detecting CAV was 69.6%; 
specificity, 96.8%; positive predictive value, 84.2%; and

negative predictive value, 92.8% (Table 2). Of the 3 false￾positive segments compared with those on CCAG as the 
reference (Table 2), 1 was detected by 16-detector CT and 
the other 2 were detected by 64-detector CT (Table 2). Of 
7 false-negative segments, 6 were revealed by 16-detector 
CT (Table 2), because of insufficient spatial resolution for 
distal lesions in 5 segments and because of motion artifacts 
in 1 segment; 64-detector CT resulted in only 1 false-nega￾tive segment (Table 2).
Figure 1 shows a representative heart transplant recipient 
whose CAV was detected by CCAG and by 16-detector CT. 
In May 2003, aged 13, the patient underwent heart transplan￾tation performed with cytomegalovirus (CMV) mismatch, 
but 2 months later he showed severe humoral rejection, 
requiring steroid-pulse therapy and plasmapheresis. He also 
had post-transplant diabetes mellitus. The coronary angio￾gram and 16-detector CT images taken in December 2006 
(Figure 1) showed wall thickening in the proximal and mid￾dle LAD. IVUS performed simultaneously showed intimal 
hyperplasia in the proximal LAD.
The sensitivity of 64-detector CT alone for detecting CAV 
was 90.0%; specificity, 97.5%; positive predictive value, 
81.8%; and negative predictive value, 98.7% (Table 2). 
Greater than 50% stenosis was detected in 5 segments by 
CCAG, and in 2 by 64-detector CT (Table 2). Figure 2
shows coronary stenosis in the proximal–middle LAD and 
proximal LCX revealed by both modalities (CCAG and 
64-MDCT) performed 9 years after transplantation. IVUS 
performed at the same time showed intimal hyperplasia in 
the proximal LAD. The patient received a heart transplant 
when he was 47 years old.
Whole-heart MRCA was successfully performed in 16 
transplant recipients without complications. Of 119 segments 
that were assessed by both CCAG and whole-heart MRCA, 
CAV was detected in 25 segments by CCAG and in 15 by 
whole-heart MRCA (Table 3). The sensitivity of MRCA for 
detecting CAV was 60.0%; specificity, 100%; positive pre￾dictive value, 100%; and negative predictive value, 92.2% 
(Table 3). Whereas no false-positive segments were de￾tected, there were 10 false-negative segments by whole-heart 
MRCA, presumably because of insufficient spatial resolu￾tion and contrast-to-noise ratio for distal lesions (Table 3).

revealed no lesion in these segments (false-negative). This 
patient received a heart transplant when he was 44 years old, 
and the imaging examinations were performed 9 years after 
transplantation.
Among the modalities used in this study, false-negative 
segments were identified in 6 of 13 segments (46%) by 16-
detector CT, in 1 of 10 segments (10%) by 64-detector CT, 
and in 10 of 24 segments (42%) by whole-heart MRCA. 
These false negatives were the result of distal lesions or 
motion artifacts (Table 4).
Discussion
CAV and Invasive Screening Tests
Cardiac transplantation has been established as a therapeutic 
option for end-stage heart disease.14,15 Because of improved 
immunosuppressive therapy, refined surgical techniques and 
awareness of post-transplant infections, cardiac transplant 
recipients may now expect a 1-year survival rate of nearly 
90%. However, survival is reduced to nearly 75% by 5 years, 
and 50–55% by 10 years.1 At 5 years post-transplant, CAV 
accounts for 33% of deaths, followed in prevalence by 
malignancies (23%).1
CAV is a rapidly progressive type of CAD that occurs 
after heart transplantation and is typically characterized by 
a diffuse concentric intimal hyperplasia that involves both 
epicardial and intramyocardial arteries.2,7 Because transplant 
recipients with CAV lack early clinical symptoms as a result 
of the insufficiently re-innervated heart, they typically pres￾ent late, with congestive heart failure, cardiac arrhythmia or 
sudden death that results from silent myocardial ischemia or 
allograft dysfunction.4,5,16 CCAG is widely performed as a 
screening test for detecting CAV; the measurement of lumi￾nal diameter by CCAG and its comparison of the narrowing 
by vasculopathies to normal reference diameter aid in the 
understanding of the severity and disease progression.17 How￾ever, because of vascular remodeling, CAV shows no initial 
decrease in luminal diameter.17 In addition, because CAV 
involves the entire coronary artery tree concentrically, CCAG 
may give the impression of lower-than-actual vessel narrow￾ing at the lesions, and even indicate normal thickness of the 
coronary arteries.7 Thus, although CCAG is a good screen￾ing tool for CAD, it often underestimates CAV, especially 
during in its early stages.7
IVUS is the most sensitive procedure for detecting CAV. 
It can detect CAV in 50% of patients at 1 year after trans￾plantation, whereas CCAG detects this disease in only 10–
20% of patients.18,19 IVUS, however, is physically restricted 
to the larger epicardial arteries and cannot be used through￾out the entire coronary artery tree.7 IVUS is also an invasive 
procedure, as with CCAG, and because of serious risks asso￾ciated with intravascular catheter manipulation, it is not 
frequently performed.8
Noninvasive Screening of CAV by MDCT
Noninvasive modalities, including stress echocardiography, 
stress nuclear scintigraphy, and coronary calcium scanning, 
detect CAV poorly.20,21 In contrast, owing to recent rapid 
technological advances, MDCT and whole-heart MRCA 
have been established as screening tests for CAD, and they 
may also be feasible for detecting CAV.
The 16-detector CT has a sensitivity of 75–82% and speci￾ficity of 88–92% in the detection of coronary atherosclerotic 
plaque, when IVUS is used as the reference method.22,23
Similar results were observed in a study using 64-detector 
CT (sensitivity 84%, specificity 97%).24 For more challeng￾ing detection of CAV compared with CCAG, sensitivity of 
83% and specificity of 95% have been reported for 16-detec￾tor CT, and a sensitivity of 70% and specificity of 92% for 
64-detector CT.5,9

Cardiac Allograft Vasculopathy by MDCT and MRCA
In the present study, the sensitivity and specificity of 
MDCT for detecting CAV were 69.6% and 96.8%, respec￾tively, which is insufficient as a screening method for CAV, 
despite the small sample size. Of 7 false-negative segments 
for detecting CAV by MDCT, 6 were identified on 16-detec￾tor CT, presumably because of insufficient spatial resolution 
for distal lesions or because of motion artifacts. Improvement 
of the temporal and spatial resolution of 64-detector CT, as 
compared with 16-detector CT, may contribute to improved 
sensitivity.
A high heart rate reduces the image quality of MDCT, so 
most studies using 16-detector CT have recommended that 
the heart rate be reduced by administration of β-blockers be￾fore the scan is performed. Cardiac re-innervation is highly 
variable and reported as only 10–30% in heart transplant 
recipients, so the efficacy of β-blockers is also considered to 
be variable and limited.5,7 Thus, β-blockers were not admin￾istered to the patients in the present study because of the 
insufficient benefit by this medication over the estimated risk.
The alternative use of dual-source CT scanners, which con￾sist of 2 independent X-ray tubes with their corresponding 
detectors mounted onto a rotating gantry with an angular 
offset of 90 degrees, improve the constant temporal resolu￾tion to 83ms and allow high-quality coronary artery imaging 
without β-blocker administration in a wide range of heart 
rates.25 Dual-source CT actually allows very frequent, diag￾nostic-image-quality coronary angiograms (92.1% of the 
coronary segments) in heart transplant recipients with high 
heart rates and no β-blocker administration, and may have 
been highly useful also for our cohort.26
Of 3 false-positive segments that were all graded as wall 
thickening by MDCT, 2 were detected by 64-detector CT, 
although IVUS was not performed and the details of the 
disagreement are unknown in these cases. One segment was 
detected by 16-detector CT and confirmed by IVUS.
MDCT may detect mural lesions induced by CAV that 
are difficult to diagnose by CCAG alone. Some studies also 
report that 16- and 64-detector CT may be more sensitive 
than CCAG for detection of thickened coronary segments in 
heart transplant recipients.5,8,9 Moreover, the diameter mea￾surements of coronary vessel show excellent correlation 
between MDCT and quantitative CAG for heart transplant 
recipients, and MDCT may be helpful for revealing late lumen 
loss, which is a typical feature of CAV.9,27 Thus, MDCT may 
be a promising noninvasive procedure for detecting CAV.
MDCT has some limitations, including the requirement for 
nephrotoxic contrast medium and radiation exposure.9 A sub￾stantial number of heart transplant recipients have impaired 
renal function, mainly because of post-transplant administra￾tion of calcineurin-inhibitors, and are therefore at risk for 
contrast-induced nephropathy.9 In addition, because of the 
smaller helical pitch and higher tube power, effective doses 
with 64-detector CT using retrospective ECG-gated helical 
technique (9.5–21.4mSv) are higher than with 16-detector 
CT (3.1–9.4mSv), as well as that required for recent routine 
diagnostic CCAG (≈2–10mSv).28,29 The use of ECG-con￾trolled tube current modulation reduces the effective dose 
by approximately 40%, as well as the lifetime attributable 
cancer risk, compared with the standard retrospective ECG￾gated helical technique, especially for women and younger 
patients, maintains diagnostic image quality, and is recom￾mended to use whenever possible.30–32 The recently introduced 
use of prospective ECG-gated axial technique allows further 
dose reduction by 77–83% to a level of lower than that with 
CCAG.28,33–35 The latter 2 scan techniques, however, have 
limited indications for patients with high heart rate and/or 
high heart rate variability as those without β-blocker admin￾istration in the present study. The indications of these dose￾reduction techniques are expected to be widened with further 
technological advancements.
Noninvasive Screening of CAV by Whole-Heart MRCA
We anticipate that whole-heart MRCA will become the ideal 
screening modality for heart transplant recipients, because it 
is noninvasive and does not require the use of nephrotoxic 
contrast medium or radiation exposure, which are essential 
for both CCAG and MDCT. This aspect of MRCA will be 
advantageous for transplant ecipients with renal dysfunction. 
To our knowledge, only a few previous studies have com￾pared whole-heart MRCA with CCAG for the feasibility of 
detecting significant coronary arterial stenosis in heart trans￾plant recipients.12,36
The feasibility of this current whole-heart technique has 
not been established for detecting CAV, which has a more 
challenging etiology than CAD. In this study, the sensitivity 
of CAV detection was 60.0%, and the specificity of whole￾heart MRCA was 100%. Metallic clips and sternal sutures did 
not hamper these image assessments, although they might 
cause surrounding signal loss, create difficulties in shimming 
for fat-signal suppression, and preclude evaluation of coro￾nary arteries.36 Whereas no false-positive segments were 
detected, MRCA revealed 10 false-negative segments, 9 of 
which were graded as wall thickening by CCAG, presumably 
because of insufficient spatial resolution and contrast-to￾noise ratio for distal lesions. In addition, 8 true-positive seg￾ments, which were graded as stenosis, were identified. Thus, 
the sensitivity was relatively lower for detecting CAV, as 
compared with MDCT. However, the use of cardiac-specific 
coils that were not available at our institution may enhance 
the signal-to-noise ratio, and the administration of β-blockers 
may improve temporal resolution.
It will be necessary to improve the temporal and spatial 
resolution of MRCA by further advances in both hardware 
and software in order to improve the detection of CAV. Spe￾cifically, 3.0-Tesla MR scanners can improve spatial resolu￾tion and/or reduce imaging time by the theoretical doubling 
of the signal-to-noise ratio from 1.5- to 3.0-Tesla.37 The cur￾rent SSFP imaging technique at 1.5-Tesla, which has gained 
wide acceptance, is prone to imaging artifacts at 3.0-Tesla 
because of the increased magnetic field inhomogeneity and 
RF distortion at higher field strengths; energy deposition is 
increased by a factor of 4 from 1.5- to 3.0-Tesla.37 Instead 
of the SSFP technique at 1.5-Tesla, the spoiled gradient-echo 
imaging technique at 3.0-Tesla using gadolinium contrast 
medium is expected to reduce imaging time, improve the 
signal-to-noise and contrast-to noise ratios, and provide more 
accurate assessment of CAD, including CAV,37 although 
the use of gadolinium contrast medium is contraindicated in 
patients with advanced renal dysfunction because of its asso￾ciation with nephrogenic systemic fibrosis. Combined with 
dedicated 32- or even 128-channel phased-array coils, 2-D 
parallel imaging with higher acceleration factors may allow 
further improvement in imaging speed and/or spatial resolu￾tion.
Study Limitations
The main limitation of the present study was the small sample 
size, primarily because heart transplant recipients are rare in 
Japan. However, familiarity with CAV is mandatory, because 
of the increasing number of these recipients with this vas-

culopathy. Early diagnosis of CAV will therefore lead to 
earlier treatment and better outcomes. Furthermore, severe 
calcified plaque of coronary vessels may degrade image 
quality and preclude accurate diagnosis of CAV, especially 
on MDCT, even when using 64-detector CT. Generally, this 
severe calcified plaque is rare in patients with CAV, except 
in advanced cases, which is different from patients with 
CAD, as in the present study, and thus we think using MDCT 
is feasible for detecting CAV. A large-scale prospective study 
comparing these techniques with CCAG or IVUS is war￾ranted in order to correctly assess the feasibility of MDCT, 
as well as MRCA, based on these preliminary results.
Conclusion
This preliminary study demonstrated the feasibility of using 
MDCT, especially 64-detector CT, for noninvasively detect￾ing CAV in heart transplant recipients. Further improvements 
in image quality in whole-heart MRCA may be required. 
Both noninvasive modalities may replace invasive CCAG 
and additional IVUS as screening tools for CAV in the near 
future.
