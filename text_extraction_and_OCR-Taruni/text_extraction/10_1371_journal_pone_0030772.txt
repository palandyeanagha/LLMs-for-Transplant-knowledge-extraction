Abstract
The signaling pathways associated with the Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kB) are essential to pro￾inflammatory cytokine and chemokine expression, as well as initiating innate epithelial immune responses. The TLR/NF-kB
signaling pathways must be stringently controlled through an intricate network of positive and negative regulatory
elements. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are non-coding small RNAs that regulate the stability and/or translation of protein-coding
mRNAs. Herein we report that miR-16 promotes NF-kB-regulated transactivation of the IL-8 gene by suppression of the
silencing mediator for retinoid and thyroid hormone receptor (SMRT). LPS stimulation activated miR-16 gene transcription in
human monocytes (U937) and biliary epithelial cells (H69) through MAPK-dependent mechanisms. Transfection of cells with
the miR-16 precursor promoted LPS-induced production of IL-8, IL-6, and IL-1a, without a significant effect on their RNA
stability. Instead, an increase in NF-kB-regulated transactivation of the IL-8 gene was confirmed in cells following
transfection of miR-16 precursor. Importantly, miR-16 targeted the 39-untranslated region of SMRT and caused translational
suppression of SMRT. LPS decreased SMRT expression via upregulation of miR-16. Moreover, functional manipulation of
SMRT altered NF-kB-regulated transactivation of LPS-induced IL-8 expression. These data suggest that miR-16 targets SMRT
and modulates NF-kB-regulated transactivation of the IL-8 gene.

Introduction
The innate immune response represents the first line of a host’s
defense against infectious agents. Cells participating in this response
include monocytes/macrophages, neutrophils, and mucosal epithe￾lial cells [1]. These cells express a variety of pathogen pattern
recognition receptors, including the Toll-like receptors (TLRs).
Upon sensing pathogen-associated microbial patterns, TLRs recruit
adaptor proteins and activate downstream signaling cascades,
including the nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kB) and mitogen-activated
protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways. Activation of these
pathways induces production of several proinflammatory cytokines
and chemokines that participate in the innate immune response [2].
Prolonged activation of the TLR/NF-kB signaling pathway can
have devastating effects on the host and result in tissue damage and
chronic inflammatory diseases [3]. In contrast, a delayed or
insufficient response of the TLR/NF-kB pathway can result in
disseminated disease. Because of the delicate balance that is
required to protect the host from both pathogens and immune￾mediated damage, cells have developed multiple self-regulatory
systems to fine-tune TLR/NF-kB-mediated immune responses [4].
The NF-kB family of transcription factors consists of five
members: p50, p52, p65 (RelA), c-Rel, and RelB. In most cells,
NF-kB exists in a latent state in the cytoplasm bound to inhibitory
IkBs that mask NF-kB’s nuclear localization signal. Activation of
the NF-kB signaling cascade results in translocation of NF-kB into
the nucleus and subsequent expression of pro-inflammatory
cytokines and chemokines, as well as antimicrobial effector
molecules [5]. Recent studies indicate that NF-kB-mediated
transcriptional activity is also regulated by changes in chromatin
structure resulting from DNA methylation and histone modifica￾tions [6]. Co-activators and co-repressors may also modify core
histone amino-terminal tails, resulting in changes in the accessi￾bility of DNA to bind transcription factors, including NF-kB [7,8].
The silencing mediator for retinoid and thyroid hormone receptor
(SMRT, also called NCoR2) is a transcriptional coregulatory
protein containing several modulatory functional domains,
including multiple autonomous repression domains [9]. SMRT
promotes the recruitment of histone deacetylases to the DNA
promoters bound by its interacting transcription factors [10], and,
thus, serves as a repressive coregulatory factor (co-repressor) for
multiple transcription factor pathways [11]. RelA/p65-mediated
transcriptional activity is repressed both by SMRT and the nuclear
receptor co-repressor complex [11,12,13,14].
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short 20–25 nucleotides of RNA
molecules that are key post-transcriptional regulators of gene

expression [15,16]. In humans, it is predicted that expression of
,50% of protein-coding genes is controlled by miRNAs [17].
Recent studies indicate that miRNAs may be critical components
of the regulatory networks impacting epithelial immune responses
[18,19]. Transcription of miRNA genes in immune cells can be
controlled through pathogen recognition receptors, such as TLRs
and the downstream NF-kB and MAPK pathways [19,20].
Functionally, miRNAs may modulate TLR-mediated immune
responses at every step of the innate immune network, including
production and release of cytokines and chemokines [19,20,21],
expression of adhesion and co-stimulatory molecules [19,22], and
feedback regulation of immune responses [19,20,23]. We
previously described an altered expression profile of miRNAs in
human biliary epithelial cells following LPS stimulation or
microbial challenge [24,25]. Of these upregulated miRNAs,
miR-16 is predicted to be a critical regulator of TLR-mediated
inflammatory responses. Indeed, miR-16 induces rapid degrada￾tion of RNAs, which contain AU-rich elements (AREs) in their 39-
untranslated regions (39UTRs) in HeLa cells [26]. The majority of
cytokine and chemokine mRNAs contain AREs within their
39UTRs, including those cytokines and chemokines associated
with the early stages of the immune response, such as tumor
necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-8 (IL-8), and IL-6 [27]. miR-16-
mediated degradation of mRNAs requires the miRNA processing
components, Dicer, Ago/eiF2C family members, and the ARE
binding protein, tristetraprolin, and involves interactions between
the sequence UAAUAUU of miR-16 and AREs within the
39UTRs of targeted mRNAs [26]. In contrast, Li et al. recently
reported that miR-16 is downregulated during human monocyte￾macrophage differentiation, and a decrease in miR-16 levels
prevents macrophage hyperactivation by acting to repress the
activation of NF-kB target genes [28].
In this study, we investigated the expression of miR-16 in
human monocytes and biliary epithelial cells in response to LPS
stimulation, and the potential role of miR-16 in controlling LPS￾stimulated expression of inflammatory genes. The data we report
here demonstrate that LPS stimulation decreased cellular
expression of SMRT by upregulating miR-16 in a MAPK￾dependent manner. Induction of miR-16 showed no effects on the
mRNA stability of selected inflammatory cytokines and chemo￾kines, but promoted NF-kB-regulated transactivation of the IL-8
gene through suppression of SMRT. Together, these data suggest
that miR-16 targets SMRT to modulate NF-kB-regulated
inflammatory responses in human monocytes and biliary epithelial
cells.
Materials and Methods
Cell lines, reagents, and antibodies
H69 cells are SV40-transformed human biliary epithelial cells
originally derived from a normal liver harvested for transplant.
This cell line expresses biliary epithelial cell markers and TLRs
consistent with biliary function and was cultured as in previous
studies [22,23]. U937 cells were obtained from ATCC (Manassas,
VA) and cultured in RPMI1640 (Invitrogen) medium supple￾mented with 10% fetal bovine serum (heat inactivated). SC-514
(100 mM, Calbiochem), a potent IKK-2 inhibitor, was used to
inhibit NF-kB activation. PD98059 (50 mM, MAPK/MEK
inhibitor), SB203580 (10 mM, MAPK/p38 inhibitor), and
SP600125 (20 mM, MAPK/JNK inhibitor) were obtained from
Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). LPS (E. coli strain K12; Invivogen)
was used at a final concentration of 1 mg/ml. Actinomycin D was
purchased from Fisher Scientific (Pittsburgh, PA). At the utilized
concentrations, no cytotoxic effects of any of the chemicals were
observed on H69 and U937 cells. Anti-SMRT and anti-p65 were
obtained from Bethyl Laboratories (Montgomery, TX) and
Millipore (Billerica, MA), respectively.
Plasmids
The pGL3-basic vector containing IL-8 promoter region was
obtained from Dr. A. Bradley (Mayo Clinic, MN, USA). The HA￾SMRT was a gift from Dr. Hung-Ying Ka (Case Western Reserve
University, OH, USA). Human SMRT siRNAs and control
siRNAs were purchased from QIAGEN (Valencia, CA). Comple￾mentary 40-mer DNA oligonucleotides containing the putative
miR-16 target site within the 39UTR of human SMRT were
synthesized with flanking SpeI and HindIII restriction enzyme
digestion sites (Table S1). The annealed oligonucleotides were
ligated into the SpeI-HindIII sites of the pMIR-REPORT
Luciferase vector (Ambion) for studies examining the potential
post-transcriptional luciferase regulation by miR-16 interaction
with the SMRT 39UTR, as we previously reported [22,23]. As an
additional control, a pMIR-REPORT Luciferase construct was
generated containing SMRT 39UTR with two mutations (both
CTG to GAC) in the putative seed regions for miR-16.
Anti-miRs and miRNA precursors
To manipulate cellular abundance of miRNAs, miRNA
antisense oligonucleotides (anti-miRs) were used to inhibit miRNA
function. Specific miRNA precursors to increase miRNA expres￾sion were also used as previously reported [22,23]. H69 and U937
cells were transfected 0–30 nM of the precursors of miR-16
(Ambion), or anti-miR-16 (Ambion), using the lipofectamineTM
2000 reagent (Invitrogen). Non-specific antisense and precursor
(Ambion) miRNAs were used as controls in these studies.
Measurement of cytokine and chemokine proteins
The BeadlyteH Human Multi-Cytokine Flex Kit (Millipore) was
used per the manufacturer’s protocol to measure selected cytokines
and chemokines (IL-8, IL-1a, IL-6, IL-1b, IL12-p40, G-CSF, and
RANTES) in H69 and U937 cells stimulated with 1 mg/ml LPS
for 12 h with or without transfection with miR-16 precursors.
Results were read on the LuminexH 200TM Instrument (Austin,
TX).
Real-time PCR
For real-time PCR analysis of mature miR-16, total RNAs were
extracted using the mirVanaTM miRNA Isolation Kit (Ambion).
An aliquot containing 0.05 mg of total RNA was reverse￾transcribed by using the Taqman MicroRNA Reverse Transcrip￾tion Kit (Applied Biosystems). Comparative real-time PCR was
performed in triplicate with the use of the Taqman Universal PCR
Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) on the Applied Biosystems 7500
FAST real-time PCR System. Mature miR-16 specific primers
and probes were obtained from Applied Biosystems. Normaliza￾tion was performed using RNU6B primers, and relative expression
was calculated using the comparative cycle threshold (Ct) method
[24,25].
For analysis of pri-miRNAs and mRNAs, total RNA was
isolated from cells using Trizol (Ambion) per the manufacturer’s
instructions. RNAs were treated with the DNA-freeTM Kit
(Ambion) to remove any contaminating DNA. Comparative
real-time PCR was performed using the SYBR Green methodol￾ogy (SYBR Green PCR Master Mix, Applied Biosystems). Specific
primers for pri-miRNAs and mRNAs are listed in Table S1. All
reactions were run in triplicate. The Ct values were analyzed using
the comparative Ct (DDCt) method [24,25]. The relative levels of
miR-16 Regulates IL-8 Expression

target RNAs were determined by normalizing the reaction to the
level endogenous reference glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydro￾genase (GAPDH) in each sample and expressed as the relative
amount of target to the control (non-treated cells).
Northern blot
Total RNAs harvested with Trizol reagent were analyzed on a
15% Tris/Borate/EDTA (90 mM Tris/64.6 mM boric acid/
2.5 mM EDTA, pH 8.3)-urea gel (Invitrogen) and transferred to a
Nytran nylon transfer membrane (Ambion). LNA DIG-probes for
miR-16 (Exiqon, Vedbaek, Denmark) were hybridized using
UltraHyb reagents (Ambion) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions, with snRNA RNU6B blotted as a control.
Measurement of RNA stability
H69 cells were transfected with miR-16 precursors (30 nM) or
anti-miR-16 (30 nM) for 24 h, then treated with LPS (1 mg/ml) for
2 h. Transcription was stopped using actinomycin D (10 mg/ml),
and RNAs were prepared either immediately or at 0.5, 1, and 2 h
post-actinomycin D treatment. Real-time RT-PCR was then
performed on the resultant RNA. Each sample was run in
triplicate. The relative abundance of mRNAs of IL-8, IL-1a, and
IL-6 was calculated using the DDCt method and normalized to
GAPDH. The amount of mRNA at 0h following actinomycin D
treatment was arbitrarily set to 1. Curve fittings of the resultant
data were performed using Microsoft Excel.
Binding of miR-16 to SMRT 39UTR
A PCR-based approach previously established to detect direct
binding of a miRNA molecule to its targeted mRNA 39UTR was
used [29]. Briefly, total RNA was collected using Trizol
(Invitrogen). Reverse transcription was primed with DNA
oligonucleotides corresponding to miR-16 sequence (59-TAG￾CAGCACGTAAATATTGGCG-39). Oligonucleotides to miR￾143-3p (59-TGAGATGAAGCACTGTAGCTC-39) were used as
a negative control because no potential binding site for miR-143-
3p was identified within SMRT 39UTR based on complementar￾ity analysis. After reverse transcription, all samples were treated
with RNase H at 37uC for 1 h and then amplified with the SMRT
gene-specific primers (Table S1). PCR products were resolved in
1.5% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide, as previously
reported [29].
Luciferase assay
Cells were transfected with each reporter construct, as well as
anti-miR-16 or miR-16 precursor (Ambion), followed by assess￾ment of luciferase activity 24 h after transfection. Luciferase
activity was measured and normalized to the expression of the
control b-Gal construct, as previously reported [23]. In addition,
the full sequence of the IL-8 promoter was cloned into the pGL3-
Basic luciferase vector to transfect cells and monitor NF-kB
activation.
Results
LPS stimulation increases miR-16 gene transcription in a
MAPK-dependent but NF-kB-independent manner
Using microarray analysis, we previously reported altered
expression of mature miRNAs in H69 cells following LPS
stimulation [24]. Of these specific miRNAs expressed in H69
cells, miR-16 increased following LPS stimulation for 8 h [24]. In
the current study, we assessed the kinetics of miR-16 expression in
both its mature and primary transcript forms, in H69 and U937
cells following LPS stimulation using real-time PCR. The
expression of mature miR-16 did not significantly increase at
early time points after LPS exposure in either cell line. Increased
mature miR-16 expression was initially detected in cells after
exposure to LPS for 8 h (2.0-fold increase), which lasted up to 24 h
(4.5-fold increase) as compared to non-LPS treated control cells
(Fig. 1A). Increased expression of mature miR-16 following LPS
stimulation was further confirmed by Northern blot in both cell
lines (Fig. 1B).
Because mature miR-16 is encoded by two separate genes
located on chromosomes 13 and 3, which are transcribed to
produce pri-miR-16-1 and pri-miR-16-2, respectively (Fig. 1C), we
analyzed the kinetics of altered pri-miR-16-1 and pri-miR-16-2
expression in H69 and U937 cells following LPS stimulation.
Levels of both pri-miR-16-1 and pri-miR-16-2 showed a time￾dependent increase in cells following LPS stimulation (Fig. 1C).
Expression of pri-miR-16-1 and pri-miR-16-2 was increased at 4 h
after LPS challenge and declined to basal levels by 12 h after LPS
stimulation (Fig. 1C).
Similar to the regulation of protein-coding RNA genes,
transcription of miRNA genes appears to be regulated by multiple
signaling pathways. Activation of the NF-kB and MAPK signaling
pathways through TLRs is a common response following LPS
stimulation [2]. To determine the role of these signaling pathways
in LPS-induced transactivation of miR-16-encoding genes, we
measured the levels of pri-miRNA-16-1 and pri-miR-16-2 in H69
and U937 cells in response to LPS in the presence or absence of
pharmacological inhibitors to NF-kB or MAPK pathways.
Treatment of cells with a specific IKK2 inhibitor, SC-514, inhibits
p65-associated transcriptional activation of the NF-kB pathway
(Fig. S1) [30], but had no inhibitory effect on the expression of pri￾miR-16-1 and pri-miR-16-2 (Fig. 1D). In contrast, cells treated
with LPS in the presence of a mix of MAPK inhibitors (50 mM of
PD98059, 10 mM of SB203580, and 20 mM of SP600125) showed
a significant decrease in pri-miR-16-2, but not pri-miR-16-1, in
both cell lines (Fig. 1E). Blockage of nuclear translocation of NF￾kB p65 by SC-514, but not the MAPK inhibitors, in cells induced
by LPS was confirmed by immunofluorescent microscopy (Fig.
S1). To clarify whether TLR4 is required for LPS-induced pri￾miR-16 expression, we tested the expression of pri-miR-16-1 and
pri-miR-16-2 in H69 cells stably expressing the dominant negative
(DN) functionally defective mutant of TLR4 [23]. No significant
increase of pri-miR-16-1 and pri-miR-16-2 was detected in cells
expressing TLR4-DN following LPS stimulation (Fig. S2). These
data suggest that LPS stimulation increases miR-16 gene
transcription in H69 and U937 cells through MAPK-dependent
but NF-kB-independent mechanisms.
miR-16 regulates LPS-stimulated expression of IL-8, IL-6,
and IL-1a
We then measured the production of TLR-mediated inflam￾matory cytokines and chemokines at the protein level in H69 and
U937 cells following LPS stimulation. Increased production of G￾CSF, IL-8, IL-1a, IL-6, and RANTES proteins was detected in
H69 cells at 12 h after LPS stimulation. No increase in IL-1b, IL￾4, and IL12-p40 protein levels was found (Fig. S3A). LPS
stimulation increased protein production of IL-8, IL-1a, IL-6,
IL-1b, and IL12-p40 in U937 cells. At the protein level, no
changes in G-CSF, RANTES, and IL-4 were detected in LPS￾treated U937 cells (Fig. S3B). Of note, increase of IL-1b content in
U937 cells following LPS stimulation should cover both pro-IL-1b
and the processed mature form of IL-1b because whole cell lysates
(not the supernatants) were used for the measurement. In addition,
a significant increase in the mRNA levels of IL-8, IL-1a, and IL-6

was also detected in both H69 and U937 cells following LPS
stimulation (Fig. S4).
Previous studies demonstrated that miR-16 restricted produc￾tion of cytokines and chemokines in HeLa cells [26]. To test the
impact of miR-16 levels on LPS-regulated expression of
inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in H69 cells, we
overexpressed miR-16 in H69 cells by transfection of the cells
with the miR-16 precursor, and measured the expression of
selected cytokines and chemokines following LPS stimulation.
Unexpectedly, we detected a significant increase in IL-8, IL-1a,
and IL-6 proteins in cells transfected with the miR-16 precursor,
compared to cells transfected with the non-specific control
precursor (Fig. 2A). Transfection of H69 cells with the miR-16
precursor also significantly increased LPS-stimulated expression of
IL-8, IL-1a, and IL-6 at the mRNA levels in a dose-dependent
manner (Fig. 2B). A similar increase in IL-8, IL-1a, and IL-6
mRNA levels was evident in U937 cells transfected with the miR￾16 precursor (Fig. 2C). In contrast, transfection of H69 cells with
anti-miR-16 to inhibit miR-16 function attenuated LPS-induced
upregulation of IL-8, IL-1a, and IL-6 mRNAs, compared to cells
transfected with the non-specific control anti-miR (Fig. 2D). Taken
together, these data demonstrate that miR-16 promotes LPS￾induced expression of IL-8, IL-1a, and IL-6 at the mRNA and
protein levels in H69 and U937 cells.
Using HeLa cells, previous studies reported that miR-16
induced degradation of several mRNAs by binding to the AREs
of 39UTRs of the mRNAs [26]. The majority of cytokine and
chemokine mRNAs, including IL-8, IL-6, and IL-1a, contain
AREs within their 39UTRs [27]. To test the potential involvement
of miR-16-associated RNA destabilization for these particular
cytokines, we transfected H69 cells with the miR-16 precursor or
anti-miR-16, then measured the mRNA stability of IL-8, IL-1a,
and IL-6 following LPS stimulation. As shown in Fig. 3A, the miR￾16 precursor had no influence on the mRNA stability of IL-8, IL￾1a, and IL-6 after treatment with LPS. Similarly, anti-miR-16 did
not influence IL-8, IL-1a, and IL-6 mRNA stability in LPS￾stimulated cells (Fig. 3B).
Given that IL-8, IL-1a, and IL-6 are all characterized as NF￾kB-dependent genes, we then examined the role of miR-16 in NF￾kB-regulated transcriptional activity in H69 cells in response to
LPS stimulation. NF-kB-regulated transcriptional activity was
monitored by using an NF-kB-driven IL-8 luciferase reporter
construct as previously reported [23]. H69 cells were co￾transfected with the luciferase reporter construct and either the
miR-16 precursor or anti-miR-16 for 24 h, followed by exposure
to LPS for an additional 6 h. Luciferase activity was measured and
normalized to the b-gal control. Transfection of H69 cells with the
miR-16 precursor resulted in a significant increase in LPS-induced
luciferase activity (Fig. 4A). Complementarily, knockdown of miR￾16 using anti-miR-16 caused a decrease in the associated luciferase
activity (Fig. 4B). Together, the above data suggest that miR-16
enhances NF-kB-regulated transcriptional activation and pro￾motes production of IL-8, IL-6, and IL-1a in H69 and U937 cells
in response to LPS stimulation.
SMRT is a target for miR-16, and LPS stimulation
decreases expression of SMRT via induction of miR-16
To further elucidate the mechanisms underlying the promotion
of NF-kB-regulated transcriptional activation in response to LPS
by miR-16, we used Targetscan 5.1 (www.targetscan.org) [31] to
identify predicted miR-16 targets, focusing on known co￾repressors of NF-kB signaling. In silico analysis revealed that a
miR-16 seed sequence was predicted in one of the highly
conserved regions of the 39UTR of SMRT (Fig. S5). To test
whether SMRT is regulated by miR-16, H69 cells were
transfected with a specific siRNA to knockdown Drosha, which
is required for miRNA maturation [32]. We detected a 1.5-fold
increase in SMRT protein levels in Drosha siRNA-treated cells
compared to the control siRNA-treated cells (Fig. S6), suggesting
miRNA-mediated suppression of SMRT in H69 cells.
To address whether miR-16 can directly bind to SMRT
39UTR, we took a PCR-based approach as previously reported
[29], using the miR-16 oligonucleotide as a primer in a reverse
transcription reaction to examine whether it would prime the
SMRT mRNA harvested from H69 cells. The oligonucleotide
corresponding to miR-16, but not miR-143-3p, primed first strand
synthesis from the SMRT mRNA (Fig. 5A), suggesting that a miR￾16 binding site exists in the SMRT 39UTR. To further test
whether miR-16 can bind to the 39UTR of SMRT and result in
translational suppression of SMRT, we generated a pMIR￾REPORT luciferase construct containing the SMRT 39UTR
with the putative miR-16 binding site (Fig. S5). In addition, a
pMIR-REPORT luciferase construct containing the SMRT
39UTR with a mutation at the putative miR-16 binding site
(CTG to GAC) was generated as the control construct (Fig. S5).
H69 cells were transfected with these reporter constructs, and
luciferase activity was assessed 24 h after transfection. As shown in
Fig. 5B, a significant decrease of luciferase activity was detected in
cells transfected with the SMRT 39UTR construct containing the
potential binding site compared with the empty control vector,
suggesting endogenous translational repression of the construct
with the SMRT 39UTR. In addition, anti-miR-16 markedly
increased SMRT 39UTR-associated luciferase activity, but did not
impact luciferase activity in H69 cells transfected with the mutant
SMRT 39UTR construct (Fig. 5C). In contrast, transfection with
the miR-16 precursor significantly decreased luciferase reporter
translation (Fig. 5C). The miR-16 precursor had no effect on
luciferase activity in cells transfected with the mutant SMRT
39UTR construct in H69 cells, suggesting that miR-16 may
suppress translation of SMRT mRNA by binding to the 39UTR
region of SMRT.
To test whether miRNA-mediated translational repression of
SMRT is directly relevant to SMRT protein expression, we
treated H69 and U937 cells with anti-miR-16 or miR-16
precursor for 48 h and then measured SMRT protein expression
by Western blot. Transfection of H69 and U937 cells with anti￾miR-16 caused a dose-dependent increase of SMRT protein
content (Fig. 5D). In contrast, a dose-dependent decrease of
SMRT protein content was observed in cells treated with the miR￾16 precursor (Fig. 5D). Nevertheless, no significant change in
SMRT mRNA levels was detected between the control cells and
cells treated with miR-16 precursor or anti-miR-16 (Fig. 5D).
Coupled with miR-16-mediated translational suppression of
SMRT mRNA, our data suggest that miR-16 represses SMRT
expression through translational suppression, not RNA degrada￾tion.
We then assessed SMRT expression in H69 and U937 cells
following LPS stimulation and its correlation to LPS-induced
upregulation of miR-16. No significant alterations in SMRT
protein level were detected in cells at early time points after LPS
stimulation (from 15 min to 6 h) (Fig. S7). Nevertheless, a
significant decrease in SMRT protein levels was detectable in
H69 and U937 cells following LPS stimulation at later time points,
especially after LPS treatment for 24 h (Fig. 6A). When H69 or
U937 cells were exposed to LPS for up to 24 h, no significant
changes in SMRT mRNA levels were detected, as assessed by real￾time PCR (Fig. 6B). Interestingly, SC-514 did not block LPS￾induced decrease of SMRT protein content in H69 cells (Fig. 6C).

SMRT protein in H69 and U937 cells (Fig. 6D). Transfection of
cells with the non-specific anti-miR control showed no effects on
LPS-induced downregulation of SMRT protein (Fig. 6D). The
above data suggest that miR-16 upregulation is required for LPS￾induced downregulation of SMRT protein in H69 and U937 cells.
Functional manipulation of SMRT impacts NF-kB￾regulated transcriptional activity induced by LPS
The SMRT protein has emerged as a negative regulator of the
production of cytokines and chemokines [11,14]. To test whether
SMRT regulates NF-kB transcriptional activation and IL-8
production in H69 and U937 cells in response to LPS stimulation,
we performed loss-of-function (by siRNA interference) and gain￾of-function (by overexpression of SMRT) experiments. Transfec￾tion of H69 and U937 cells with SMRT siRNA significantly
decreased SMRT expression, resulting in a knockdown of SMRT
by 70% and 30%, respectively, over control levels (Fig. 7A). We
then measured IL-8 mRNA levels in cells with and without LPS
treatment. A significant increase in LPS-induced expression of IL￾8 mRNA in cells transfected with the SMRT siRNA, compared to
the cells transfected with the control siRNA, was detected (Fig. 7A).
Increased IL-8 mRNA levels were also detected in cells transfected
with SMRT siRNA but without LPS treatment, compared to cells
transfected with the control siRNA (Fig. 7A). In contrast,
transfection of H69 cells with the HA-SMRT construct increased
the SMRT protein level about 2-fold (with the relative ratio of
exogenous versus endogenous SMRT around 2.3), resulting in a
significant decrease in LPS-stimulated luciferase activity in cells
transfected with the NF-kB-driven IL-8 luciferase reporter
construct (Fig. 7B). Similarly, a decrease in NF-kB-regulated
luciferase activity was detected in cells overexpressing SMRT
without LPS treatment, compared to cells transfected with the
control plasmid (Fig. 7B). To test whether miR-16-mediated
SMRT translational repression can abolish SMRT-induced
repression of NF-kB activity after LPS treatment, H69 cells were
co-transfected with the NF-kB-driven IL-8 luciferase reporter
construct with or without the miR-16 precursor for 24 h followed
by exposure to LPS for 6 h. H69 cells transfected with the miR-16
precursor had increased LPS-stimulated NF-kB transcriptional
activity. Overexpression of SMRT inhibited LPS-stimulated NF￾kB transcriptional activity (Fig. 7C). Notably, overexpression of
SMRT attenuated the effects of the miR-16 precursor on LPS￾induced NF-kB transcriptional activation (Fig. 7C). Together,
these data suggest that miR-16 regulates LPS-stimulated NF-kB
transcriptional activation through repression of SMRT.
Discussion
In this study, we demonstrated that LPS stimulation increases
miR-16 expression in human U937 monocytes and H69 epithelial
cells partially through MAPK-mediated transcription of the mir￾15b-16-2 gene. miR-16 targets SMRT 39UTR and causes
translational repression. LPS stimulation decreases SMRT expres￾sion by upregulating miR-16. Overexpression of miR-16 promotes
NF-kB transcriptional activation induced by LPS through
suppression of SMRT, resulting in enhanced production of
inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, such as IL-8. These
data suggest that miR-16 targets SMRT to modulate TLR/NF￾kB-mediated transcription of inflammatory genes, a process that
may be involved in the regulation of inflammatory responses
during microbial infection of innate immune cells.
miRNA expression may be regulated in a similar manner to that
of protein-coding genes, using both transcriptional and post￾transcriptional mechanisms [19,20]. Activation of downstream
signaling pathways associated with TLRs may regulate miRNA
expression through both mechanisms. In our previous study and
those from other groups, a panel of TLR/NF-kB-responsive
miRNA genes has been identified in various cell types
[19,20,24,25]. TLR-mediated transcription of miRNA genes, such
as the mir-21 gene, is coordinately regulated by multiple
downstream signaling pathways, including the MAPK and NF￾kB signaling pathways [19,20,33]. More recently, it has been
reported that the MAPK signaling pathway can promote
phosphorylation of the HIV TAR RNA-binding protein, thus
enhancing global miRNA maturation by increasing the stability of
the miRNA-generating complex [34]. Consistent with previous
results [24], we detected upregulation of mature miR-16 in human
monocytes and epithelial cells following LPS treatment. We also
detected the upregulation of both pri-miR-16-1 and pri-miR-16-2,
primary transcripts of mature miR-16 from two miR-16 genes,
mir-15a-16-1 and mir-15b-16-2, respectively [24,26,35]. Given the
correlation of the dynamic kinetics between the mature and
primary transcript forms of miR-16, transactivation of the miR-16
genes may account for the upregulation of miR-16 in cells

following LPS stimulation. Indeed, NF-kB and MAPK inhibitors
had no effects on LPS-stimulated upregulation of pri-miR-16-1. In
contrast, MAPK inhibitors, but not an NF-kB inhibitor,
attenuated LPS-stimulated upregulation of pri-miR-16-2. In a
previous report by Shin et al., upregulation of miR-16 was
demonstrated to be dependent on the activation of NF-kB
signaling in gastric cells following nicotine treatment [36].
Whether the transactivation of miR-16 genes is differentially
regulated by the NF-kB and MAPK signaling pathways in
different cell types merits further investigation.
The usual consequence of miRNA and mRNA interactions is
decreased protein expression by translational repression and/or
mRNA cleavage of the target gene. miR-16 contains a
UAAAUAUU sequence that is complementary to the 39UTR
AREs of mRNAs for many inflammatory cytokines and chemo￾kines, such as IL-8, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha [26,27].
Binding of miR-16 to the AREs of these mRNAs promotes ARE￾mediated RNA degradation, resulting in destabilization of the
targeted mRNAs [26]. In this study, we did not detect a significant
impact of miR-16 upregulation on the RNA stability of these
mRNAs (IL-6 and IL-8) in human H69 epithelial cells and U937
cells (data not shown) in response to LPS stimulation. Instead, we
identified SMRT as a target for miR-16. LPS stimulation of U937
and H69 cells decreases SMRT expression through upregulation
of miR-16. Physical interaction between miR-16 and SMRT
39UTR was demonstrated by RT-PCR using the miR-16
oligonucleotide as a primer in a reverse transcription reaction.
Using a luciferase construct containing the sequence in the SMRT
39UTR predicted to bind to miR-16, we observed translational
suppression of SMRT, indicating that miR-16 binding transla￾tionally suppresses SMRT. Functional manipulation of miR-16
caused reciprocal alterations in SMRT protein but not SMRT
mRNA levels. Anti-miR-16 significantly attenuated LPS-induced
downregulation of SMRT in the cells.
SMRT has been demonstrated to function as a regulatory co￾repressor of NF-kB transcriptional activity via its association with
histone deacetylases recruited to the promoters of NF-kB￾regulated genes [11,13,14]. Analysis of SMRT-deficient macro￾phages revealed that SMRT represses subsets of NF-kB-dependent
inflammatory genes, including IL-8, IL-6, and IL-1a [11].
Consistent with this observation, we demonstrated that overex￾pression of SMRT repressed LPS-stimulated NF-kB transcrip￾tional activity in U937 and H69 cells. Accordingly, functional
manipulation of miR-16 had a significant impact on LPS-induced
production of IL-8, IL-6, and IL-1a. Each miRNA may have
multiple mRNA targets in different cell types [15-19]. Although

miR-16 may have additional targets that could influence LPS￾mediated gene expression, our data suggest that miR-16
modulates LPS-induced expression of these genes by targeting
SMRT, as SMRT overexpression attenuated the effects of the
miR-16 precursor on IL-6, IL-8, and IL-1a expression. Our results
are consistent with a recent report by Li et al, showing that miR-16
is downregulated during human monocyte-macrophage differen￾tiation, and a decrease in miR-16 prevents macrophage hyper￾activation, repressing the activation of NF-kB target genes [28].
From a physiological viewpoint, LPS-induced downregulation
of SMRT through MAPK-dependent upregulation of miR-16 and
its subsequent effects on NF-kB-mediated transcriptional activity
may serve as one component in the network responsible for fine￾tuning inflammatory responses in innate immune cells. Because
induction of miR-16 and subsequent suppression of SMRT
happen at later time points following primary stimulation, such
a mechanism may be responsible for resetting chromatin for
subsequent rounds of transcription, relevant to cellular inflamma￾tory responses in general. In addition, these data may provide the
framework for a new avenue for exploring the cross-talking
between the MAPK and NF-kB signaling pathways, both of which
are involved in downstream signaling following TLR stimulation.
Activation of MAPK signaling has been well-documented to
regulate RNA turnover and protein stability of inflammatory
effector molecules through post-transcriptional mechanisms
[37,38]. Such activities of MAPK signaling are involved in the
regulation of NF-kB-mediated inflammatory responses [27,38].
MAPK-mediated expression of SMRT through modulation of
miR-16 and its subsequent effects on NF-kB-mediated transcrip￾tional activity may provide a new area of exploration for fine￾tuning TLR/NF-kB-mediated host reactions in response to
microbial challenge.
