Abstract
Background: The surgical management of renal cell carcinoma with invasion of the renal vein or inferior vena cava
is associated with significant rates of perioperative morbidity and mortality. In this report we propose a surgical
checklist aimed at reducing adverse events associated with the resection of these tumors.
Methods: This review describes the development of an evidence- and experience-based surgical checklist aimed at
improving the perioperative safety of patients undergoing radical nephrectomy and tumor thrombectomy.
Results: Reducing the risk of complications during the surgical management of renal tumors with venous invasion
begins with appropriate pre-operative imaging aimed at defining the cranial extent of the tumor thrombus, thus
facilitating accurate preoperative planning. Other key elements of the checklist are aimed at ensuring clear and
precise pre-, intra- and postoperative communication between members of the multidisciplinary-care team.
Conclusion: A standardized surgical checklist may help to increase the perioperative safety of patients undergoing
radical nephrectomy and tumor thrombectomy. Future validation studies are required to determine the clinical
feasibility and post-implementation safety profile of this new checklist.
Keywords: Checklist, Renal cell carcinoma, Inferior vena cava, Tumor thrombus
Introduction
Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is known to invade the renal
vein or inferior vena cava (IVC) in 4 to 10% of cases [1].
The management of these tumors is limited to surgical
intervention which is associated with significant rates of
perioperative morbidity and mortality ranging from
11.5% to 25% and 1.5% to 6%, respectively [2-4]. The
high rate of complications associated with radical neph￾rectomy and tumor thrombectomy has drawn attention
to ways to improve the safety of this procedure.
Borrowing from lessons learned in the aviation indus￾try, in 2008 the World Health Organization (WHO)
unveiled a universal surgical safety checklist aimed at
minimizing perioperative morbidity and mortality [5].
Only one year after its debut, the checklist was shown to
be effective in significantly improving surgical safety [6].
The lead author of the WHO checklist has previously
described the keys to a successful checklist, which in￾clude: brevity, clarity, and usability [7].
In the field of urology, surgical checklists have recently
been described for the performance of transurethral re￾section of bladder tumor as well as partial nephrectomy
[8,9]. Herein, we propose a checklist for performing rad￾ical nephrectomy for RCC with renal vein or IVC in￾volvement. Our checklist is divided into three sections:
(1) preoperative workup and surgical planning (2) the
operating room, and (3) case closure/sign-out.
Methods
A safety checklist for the surgical management of RCC
with tumor thrombus was developed based on a review
of the English-language literature and our own operative
experience (Table 1). More specifically, PubMed was
searched for contemporary articles which describe vari￾ous technical aspects of performing radical nephrectomy
for tumors with venous invasion. Those articles relevant

to patient safety were reviewed and common practices
were incorporated into our checklist.
Checklist components
Preoperative workup and surgical planning
Patient selection Surgery is indicated in patients without
evidence of metastatic disease who are otherwise fit for
surgery. In the absence of metastatic disease, those under￾going surgery have 5-year survival rates approaching 70%
[10]. Additionally, surgery may be considered in patients
with metastatic disease for palliative measures such as to
reduce pain or vena caval syndrome. However, the median
survival for this subset of patients is estimated at less than
2 years [11].

Preoperative evaluation A complete history and phys￾ical examination should be performed for all patients.
Special attention should be paid to the patient’s past
medical history and performance status, as many
patients will require referral to a cardiologist or internist
for medical optimization prior to surgery. Further, the
surgeon should document the presence or absence of
lower extremity edema, which is an important factor in
determining whether a patient can tolerate a surgical
interruption of the IVC. The absence of lower extremity
edema suggests the development of venous collaterals.
Other components of the preoperative workup include
routine lab work (i.e. serum electrolytes, a complete
blood count, liver function tests and a coagulation
panel), chest x-ray and possibly a nutritional assessment.
Working in collaboration with a medicine specialist,
additional studies may be required to evaluate a patient’s
cardiac and respiratory status. This may include a stress
test and/or an echocardiogram. In addition, cessation of
preoperative anticoagulation and the need for bridging
therapy should also be addressed.
Operative planning The most important information
needed for operative planning is the level of tumor ex￾tension. Adverse event rates have been shown to in￾crease with higher levels of the tumor thrombus [12].
Preoperative imaging can accurately identify the level
and volume of the tumor thrombus, presence of a coex￾isting bland (i.e. blood) thrombus, presence of contralat￾eral disease, and if caval wall invasion has occurred.
The presence of a coexisting bland thrombus
increases the possibility that the patient will need to
undergo an IVC resection, or less preferably placement
of an IVC filter [13]. Magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) is currently the gold standard for detecting a
tumor thrombus level with 100% sensitivity [14]. In
patients with metallic implants (e.g. pacemakers, metal
plates or screws), MRI is typically contraindicated and
multidetector computerized tomography can be used
instead [15]. Preoperative imaging should ideally be per￾formed within 14 days of surgery and at the longest
within 30 days of surgery [16].
Anesthesia and surgical consultations Prior to the day
of surgery, the patient should be evaluated by the
anesthesia team. This should include an assessment of
the patient’s airway, prior anesthesia history, and medical
comorbidities. In addition, the surgeon should begin
communication with other surgical specialists who may
be required to aid in the procedure. Commonly this
includes a vascular and/or cardiothoracic surgeon. For
complex cases, it is often necessary to hold a multi￾disciplinary meeting several days in advance of the
procedure.
On the day of surgery, operative cases that may re￾quire the assistance of ancillary care teams should not
start until the appropriate teams have been notified or
reminded of their possible need. Patients postoperatively
going to the intensive care unit should be presented to
the ICU team the morning of surgery. Finally, any spe￾cific surgical items or equipment should be requested at
this point to allow sufficient time for them to be
acquired prior to the beginning of the surgery.
Operating room
Since serious complications can arise even with the
management of level I tumor thrombi, all patients
should have an arterial, peripheral, and central line
placed and also have blood products readily available.
For level I and level II tumor thrombi, our group has
had a median estimated blood loss of 275 mL with
75% of patients requiring at least 1 transfused unit of
blood [17]. However, the quantity of blood products
needed on stand-by should increase with higher level
tumor thrombi. For level III tumor thrombi, the mean
blood loss was 500 mL (range 100 to 5,000) [18]. As
would be expected, the management of supradiaphrag￾matic tumor thrombi are the most complex and have
had a mean blood loss of 2960 mL (range 500 to
7000) requiring a mean 9 units of blood (range 0 to
16) [19]. Cell saving techniques should be considered
in patients who are expected to have massive blood
loss or are unable to receive homologous blood
products.
Prior to incision, a “time out” should be performed in
accordance with the recommendations of the WHO [5].
Important aspects of a “time out” include introduction
of all team members; confirmation of the appropriate
patient, site, and procedure; the display of appropriate
imaging; the delivery of antibiotic prophylaxis, and that
any anticipated critical, surgical events have been
reviewed. It is important for the nursing staff to ensure
that all necessary surgical instruments are readily avail￾able and have been appropriately sterilized. Some
aspects of the checklist may seem repetitive or mundane;
however, they serve an important purpose in minimizing
preventable errors. An evaluation of the success of the
WHO’s checklist showed a decrease in overall death rate
from 1.5% to 0.8% (P= 0.003) and inpatient complica￾tions from 11.0% to 7% (P< 0.001) in first 30 days after
surgery [6].
Depending on the level of the tumor thrombus, the
surgical management can be more or less complex. Our
group has previously described the important steps
involved in the surgical procedures for the management
of different levels of tumor thrombi [17-21]. We briefly
review several important aspects:
Joshi et al. Patient Safety in Surgery 2012, 6:27 Page 3 of 5

Venovenous bypass (VVBP)
VVBP can be used in the treatment of level III and IV
tumor thrombi to avoid complications associated with
decreased venous return to the heart. However, VVBP
introduces its own set of risks including the possibility
for lymphocele, infection, vessel injury due to vascular
access, and air embolism [22,23] . VVBP also may not be
needed given that a large, chronic thrombus would have
fostered the development of collaterals through the lum￾bar, azygous, and hemiazygous veins [24].
Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPBP) with or without deep
hypothermic circulatory arrest (DHCA)
For tumor thrombi extending above the diaphragm, the
traditional approach has been the use of a sternotomy
and CPBP with DHCA [25,26]. CPBP has also been used
for patients undergoing removal of major tumor emboli
from the pulmonary artery. However, CPBP is associated
with several complications including coagulopathy, cen￾tral nervous system dysfunction, increased risk of
increased blood loss and transfusion requirements, peri￾operative renal dysfunction, and multi-organ failure
[25,26]. CPBP should be reserved only for large intra￾atrial tumor thrombi or major tumor emboli. CPBP can
be avoided in patients with smaller atrial thrombi or
those terminating at the cavo-atrial junction using an
entirely transabdominal approach [18]. A transabdom￾inal approach can be used to safely remove tumors with
IVC involvement [18-21].
Intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography (TEE)
Intraoperative TEE is indicated for all tumors which ex￾tend to at least the level of the major hepatic veins. In
these cases, TEE is essential as it provides real-time in￾formation regarding the proximal extent of the tumor
which may change with manipulation of the IVC or ar￾terial clamping.
IVC resection
Resection of the vena caval wall should be avoided
when the tumor is free floating and therefore can be
easily extirpated following a simple cavotomy. However,
it may be necessary to resect the IVC in cases of adher￾ent or invasive tumors so as to ensure complete local
resection. Of note, one report showed no 5-year survi￾vors in the setting of incomplete local resection [27]. In
a recent report from our group, we observed that the
presence of a bland thrombus increases the likelihood
that IVC wall invasion is present requiring IVC resec￾tion [13]. In the setting of a large, long-standing
thrombus, collaterals may be present and likely pre￾clude the need for IVC replacement. Clinically,
complete venous obstruction without the presence of
collaterals presents as lower extremity edema and
dilated abdominal wall veins. Radiographically, collat￾erals can be seen as dilated azygous, hemiazygous, or
lumbar veins [24]. Cases lacking collateral circulation
which require complete IVC resection typically necessi￾tate the use of a synthetic interpositional graft.
Presence of bland thrombus
Concomitant bland thombus is present in 15-20% of
cases with level II-IV tumors [13]. While some groups
advocate for the preoperative placement of an IVC filter
to prevent an embolic event, we disagree with this prac￾tice as it risks incorporation of the filter into the
thrombus.
Case closure and signout
Prior to closure of the surgical incision, the surgical
team should ensure that the instrument, sharp, and
towel counts are correct. Any surgical specimens being
sent for pathological analysis should be appropriately
marked and identified. A brief operative note should
be completed prior to patient transport to ensure ac￾curate communication to teams in the post-operative
recovery area or ICU. At the time of patient handoff,
the surgeon should speak directly with the receiving
team to ensure continuity of care.
Conclusion
Radical nephrectomy for RCC with venous invasion is
associated with high rates of perioperative morbidity
and mortality. The proposed surgical checklist aims to im￾prove the perioperative safety for patients undergoing this
procedure. Future validation studies are required to deter￾mine the clinical feasibility and post-implementation safety
profile of the proposed checklist.
