Abstract
Introduction: Among various lupus renal vascular changes, thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) presented with the
most severe clinical manifestations and high mortality. The pathogenesis of TMA in systemic lupus erythematosus
(SLE) was complicated. The aim of this study was to assess clinical manifestations, laboratory characteristics,
pathological features and risk factors for clinical outcomes of lupus nephritis patients co-existing with renal TMA in
a large cohort in China.
Methods: Clinical and renal histopathological data of 148 patients with biopsy-proven lupus nephritis were
retrospectively analyzed. Serum complement factor H, A Disintegrin and Metalloprotease with Thrombospondin
type I repeats 13 (ADAMTS-13) activity, antiphospholipid antibodies and C4d deposition on renal vessels were
further detected and analyzed.
Results: In the 148 patients with lupus nephritis, 36 patients were diagnosed as co-existing with renal TMA
based on pathological diagnosis. Among the 36 TMA patients, their clinical diagnoses of renal TMA were as
followings: 2 patients combining with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura-hemolytic uremic syndrome, 2
patients combining with anti-phospholipid syndrome, 2 patients with malignant hypertension, 1 patient with
scleroderma and the other 29 patients presenting with isolated renal TMA. Compared with the non-renal TMA
group, patients with renal TMA had significantly higher urine protein (7.09 ± 4.64 vs. 4.75 ± 3.13 g/24h, P =
0.007) and serum creatinine (159, 86 to 215 vs. 81, 68 to 112 μmol/l, P <0.001), higher scores of total activity
indices (AI) (P <0.001), endocapillary hypercellularity (P <0.001), subendothelial hyaline deposits (P = 0.003),
interstitial inflammation (P = 0.005), glomerular leukocyte infiltration (P = 0.006), total chronicity indices (CI) (P =
0.033), tubular atrophy (P = 0.004) and interstitial fibrosis (P = 0.018). Patients with renal TMA presented with
poorer renal outcome (P = 0.005) compared with the non-TMA group. Renal TMA (hazard ratio (HR): 2.772, 95%
confidence interval: 1.009 to 7.617, P = 0.048) was an independent risk factor for renal outcome in patients with
lupus nephritis. The renal outcome was poorer for those with both C4d deposition and decreased serum
complement factor H in the TMA group (P = 0.007).
Conclusions: There were various causes of renal TMA in lupus nephritis. Complement over-activation via both
classical and alternative pathways might play an important role in the pathogenesis of renal TMA in lupus
nephritis.

Introduction
Renal involvement is common in systemic lupus erythe￾matosus (SLE) [1]. In addition to glomerulonephritis, the
status of renal vascular lesions is also important in lupus
nephritis because their presence can adversely affect the
prognosis of the renal disease [2,3]. Among various lupus
renal vascular changes, thrombotic microangiopathy
(TMA) presented with the most severe clinical manifesta￾tions and high mortality [4]. Since the pathogenesis of
TMA in lupus nephritis is complex and unclear, detailed
descriptions about it were lacking in the literature.
In fact, TMA in lupus nephritis consisted of a group of
diseases, including anti-phospholipid syndrome (APS),
thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura-hemolytic uremic
syndrome (TTP-HUS), scleroderma, malignant hyperten￾sion and calcineurin inhibitor-associated thrombotic
microangiopathy and so on. The pathogenesis of TMA in
SLE was complicated. Recently, Danielle et al. demon￾strated that activation of the complement classical path￾way might be a crucial factor in the development of TMA
in lupus nephritis [5].
The aim of this study was to assess clinical manifesta￾tions, laboratory characteristics, pathological features and
risk factors for clinical outcomes of patients with TMA
in lupus nephritis in a large cohort of Chinese patients.
The roles of A Disintegrin and Metalloprotease with
Thrombospondin type I repeats 13 (ADAMTS-13), com￾plement factor H, antiphospholipid antibodies and C4d
deposition in renal vessels were further evaluated.
Methods
Patients
Clinical and renal histopathological data of 148 patients
with renal biopsy-proven lupus nephritis, diagnosed
between May 2002 and July 2008 in Peking University
First Hospital were reviewed.
Clinical evaluation and definitions of the diseases and
lesions
All the included patients fulfilled the 1997 American
College of Rheumatology revised criteria for SLE [6].
The disease activity was assessed by the Systemic Lupus
Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) [7,8].
TTP-HUS was characterized by microangiopathic
hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia and/or fever
and/or acute renal impairment and/or neurologic impair￾ment. APS was defined by the Sapporo criteria [9].
Renal TMA was defined as interlobular artery, arteriole
and glomerular capillary lesions, including endothelial cell
swelling, lumen narrowing or obliteration and thrombi
formation by light microscopy. Swelling of glomerular
endothelial cells, detachment from the glomerular base￾ment membrane and widening of the subendothelial space
were identified by electron microscopy (Additional file 1,
Figure S1A, B). No striated fine fibrillary structure or
other specific structure of cryoglobulinemic glomerulone￾phritis was identified by electron microscopy. The lesions
were divided into acute changes and chronic changes [5].
The acute lesion was defined as the presence of at least
one fibrin microthrombus (conformed by fibrin and CD61
staining), either in glomeruli, or in small arterioles and/or
arteries (Additional file 2, Figure S2A, B). Chronic changes
were mucoid changes and onion skin lesions of arterioles
and/or arteries (Additional file 2, Figure S2C).
The response to therapy includes complete remission,
partial remission and treatment failure detailed in previous
works [10-13]. The indications for plasma exchange was
as follows: lupus nephritis with crescentic glomerulone￾phritis, fibrinoid necrosis and thrombotic microangiopathy
in renal pathological changes, severe extra-renal involve￾ment, such as central nervous system injury, hematological
abnormalities, cardiovascular diseases, catastrophic anti￾phospholipid antibody syndrome and so on [14].
A relapse was defined as: 1) nephritic relapse: a recent
increase of serum creatinine by >50% with active urinary
sediments; 2) proteinuric relapse: development of either
a nephrotic syndrome (proteinuria >3.5 g/day and
serum albumin <30 g/L) or proteinuria >1.5 g/day with￾out other causes, in previously non-proteinuric patients
[15,16].
The patients were followed up in outpatient clinics
specified for lupus nephritis. The primary end point was
defined as death and the secondary end point was
defined as end stage renal disease (ESRD) or doubling of
serum creatinine.
Laboratory assessment
The following laboratory features were further detected
using serum at the day of renal biopsy.
Serum antinuclear antibodies (ANA) were detected
using indirect immunofluorescence assay (EUROIM￾MUN, Lübeck, Germany) and anti-double-stranded DNA
(ds-DNA) antibodies were detected using Crithidia luci￾liae indirect immunofluorescence test (EUROIMMUN,
Lübeck, Germany). Anti-extractable nuclear antigen
(ENA) antibodies, including anti-Sm, anti-SSA, anti-SSB
and anti-RNP antibodies, were detected using immuno￾dotting assay (EUROIMMUN, Lübeck, Germany).
Anti-cardiolipin antibodies and anti-b2GP-1 antibodies
were detected using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(ELISA) (EUROIMMUN, Lübeck, Germany). Serum
C3 was determined using rate nephelometry assay
(Beckman-Coulter, IMMAGE, Brea, California, USA,
normal range >0.85 g/L). Serum cryoglobulins were
detected by spectrophotometry (Beckman-Coulter,
IMMAGE, Brea, California, USA).

Quantification of serum complement factor H
The method to detect serum complement factor H (CFH)
was the same as previously described [17], with mild
modification. Serial concentrations of commercial avail￾able highly purified human factor H from 1,050 μg/ml to
16.4 μg/ml were used to develop the standard curve. The
CFH level of each sample was calculated using Curve
expert 1.3 (Hyams DG, Starkville, Mississippi, USA). The
linear portion of the curve was subsequently used for the
measurement of serum factor H. All assays were run in
duplicate, and when standard errors were over 10%, sam￾ples were routinely re-analyzed.
Detection of serum ADAMTS-13 activity
The ADAMTS-13 activity assay was the same as pre￾viously described [18]. Data were analyzed as the percen￾tage of collagen-binding activity remaining after dialysis
compared to the collagen binding activity in the indivi￾dual’s baseline sample. One hundred percent minus the
residual collagen-binding activity was arbitrarily regarded
as the ADAMTS-13 activity. Inter-assay precision was
determined by evaluating single normal human plasma in
10 consecutive assay runs for ADAMTS-13 activity deter￾mination. The inter-assay percent coefficient of variation
was found to be <10%.
Routine renal histopathology
The renal biopsy specimens were routinely examined by
light microscopy, direct immunofluorescence and elec￾tron microscopy techniques.
Lupus nephritis was re-classified according to the
International Society of Nephrology and Renal Pathology
Society (ISN/RPS) 2003 lupus nephritis classification
system [19].
Light microscopy examination
Renal biopsy specimens were fixed in 4.5% buffered for￾maldehyde for light microscopy. Consecutive serial 3
μm sections were used for histological staining. Stains
employed included hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), peri￾odic acid-Schiff (PAS), silver methenamine (Meth) and
Masson’s trichrome. Pathological parameters, such as
activity indices (AI) and chronicity indices (CI), were
approached by renal pathologists using a modification of
a previously reported system involving semi-quantitative
scoring of specific biopsy features [20,21].
Direct immunofluorescence examination
The direct immunofluorescence for immunoglobulin G
(IgG), immunoglobulin A (IgA), immunoglobulin M
(IgM), C3, C1q and fibrin was semi-quantitatively graded
from 0 to 4 according to the intensity of fluorescence,
respectively.
Electron microscopy examination
Renal biopsy specimens were fixed in 2.5% paraformal￾dehyde for electron microscopy. After being embedded
in epon, ultrathin sections were mounted on metal grids
and stained with uranyl acetate before being viewed in a
transmission electron microscope (JEM-1230; JEOL,
Tokyo, Japan).
C4d staining on renal vessels by immunohistochemistry
Staining of C4d on renal vessels was performed by immu￾nohistochemistry as was previously described [22]. Rabbit
anti-human C4d polyclonal antibodies (Abcam, Cam￾bridge, UK) were used as primary antibodies (dilution
1:400). As negative controls, primary antibodies were
replaced by normal rabbit IgG. The sections were exam￾ined by light microscopy (Additional file 2, Figure S2D).
CD61 staining in kidneys by immunohistochemistry
The method of CD61 staining was similar to C4d [23].
Rabbit anti-human CD61 polyclonal antibodies
(Zhongshan Golden Bridge Biotechnology, Beijing, China)
were used as primary antibodies (dilution 1:200).
Blood samples
Sera were obtained from peripheral blood at the same
day as the renal biopsy before initiation of immunosup￾pressive treatment. All sera samples were stored at -80°C
until used. Repeated freeze/thaw cycles were avoided.
Informed consent was obtained for blood sampling and
renal biopsy from each patient. The research was in com￾pliance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The design of
this work was approved by the local ethical committees
of Peking University First Hospital (No. 2012[470]).
Statistical analysis
Statistical software SPSS 18.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA)
was used for statistical analysis. Quantitative data were
expressed as mean ± SD, and median with range (mini￾mum, maximum). For comparison of clinical and patholo￾gical features of patients, the Student’s t-test, one-way
ANOVA analysis of variance and Chi-square test were
used. Kaplan-Meier curves were used to analyze the
patients’ prognoses. Survival analysis was performed using
the log-rank test. Multivariate analysis with Cox regression
was used to determine the prognostic factors. Results were
expressed as hazard ratio (HR) with 95% confidence inter￾vals. Statistical significance was considered as P <0.05.
Results
General data of patients with renal TMA in lupus
nephritis
First, we analyzed the general data of patients with renal
TMA in lupus nephritis (details in Table 1). Among the
148 lupus nephritis patients enrolled in this study, 36
were identified as combining with renal TMA changes by
pathological findings. In the TMA group, the average age
was 29.75 ± 9.24 (15 to 52) at presentation. Ten (27.8%)
patients were male and 26 (72.2%) were female, with a

male to female ratio of 1:2.6. Compared with previous
studies, the ratio of renal TMA in lupus nephritis was
higher.
Then, the detailed renal pathological data were analyzed.
According to the 2003 classification of lupus nephritis, 3
patients were classified Class III (8.3%, including 2 as Class
III + V), 30 as Class IV (83.3%, 1 as Class IV-segmental
(IV-S) (2.8%) and 25 as Class IV-global (IV-G) (69.4%),
including 4 as Class IV-G + V) and 3 as Class V (8.3%).
There was no case of Class I, Class II or Class VI in this
study. Class III and IV were further subdivided into an
active (A) group, active/chronic (A/C) group and chronic
(C) group. Within Class III, the number of III (A) was 1,
III (A/C) was 2 and III (C) was 0. The Class IV-S is IV-S
(A). Within Class IV-G, the number of IV-G (A) was 18,
IV-G (A/C) was 12 and IV-G (C) was 0. For further eva￾luation of renal pathological features of TMA, 17 patients
presented with pure acute lesions, 6 with pure chronic
lesions and 13 with both acute and chronic lesions, as
described in the Methods. Among the 30 patients with
acute lesions, 14 had micro-thrombi in glomeruli and 23
had micro-thrombi in small arterioles and/or arteries.

The active and chronic lesions both existed in these
patients.
We further analyzed the possible causes of renal TMA in
lupus nephritis. Among the 36 patients, there were several
clear clinical reasons for renal TMA as follows: 2 patients
combining with TTP-HUS, 2 patients combining with
APS, 2 patients with malignant hypertension, 1 patient
with scleroderma and the other 29 patients presenting with
isolated renal TMA. The other potential causes of renal
TMA included 19 patients with C4d deposition on renal
vascular walls, 2 patients with decreased ADAMTS-13
activity, and 17 patients with decreased serum complement
factor H. The ratio of patients with C4d deposition or
decreased serum factor H was high. There was no signifi￾cant correlation between the two risk factors (r = 0.088,
P = 0.610). All of the 36 patients with renal TMA were
serum cryoglobulin negative.
The treatment algorithm was listed as follows. All of the
patients received oral prednisone therapy (0.8 to 1 mg/
kg/d or equivalent for four to six weeks and tapered slowly
to a maintenance dose of 5 to 10 mg/d). A total of
19 patients received plasma exchange, including 2 patients
with TTP-HUS, 1 with catastrophic antiphospholipid anti￾body syndrome, 3 with lupus encephalopathy, 13 with
severe crescentic glomerulonephritis, fibrinoid necrosis
and thrombotic microangiopathy in renal pathological
changes, and 26 patients received methylprednisolone
pulse therapy. The majority of patients completed treat￾ment with oral cyclophosphamide (5/36) or monthly intra￾venous cyclophosphamide (600 to 800 mg/month) (25/36).
The other patients received mycophenolate mofetil (3/36),
leflunomide (2/36) and azathioprine (1/36). Twenty
patients achieved clinical remission, 8 with complete
remission and 12 with partial remission. Sixteen patients
presented with treatment failure. Most of the patients
received immunosuppressive therapy, but the responses to
the treatment were not satisfactory.
Clinical and laboratory parameters
We further compared the clinical and laboratory charac￾teristics of patients with and without renal TMA in
lupus nephritis. The clinical and laboratory features of
patients in the two groups were listed in Tables 2 and 3.
The patients in the renal TMA group were younger than
the patients in the non-renal TMA group (29.75 ± 9.24 vs.
34.38 ± 11.95 years, P = 0.035) at the time of biopsy.
There was a significantly higher ratio of nephrotic syn￾drome in the renal TMA group than in the non-renal
TMA group (83.3% vs. 58.9%, P = 0.008). In laboratory
findings, there were significantly higher urine protein
levels (7.09 ± 4.64 vs. 4.75 ± 3.13 g/24 h, P = 0.007) and
higher serum creatinine levels (159, 86 to 215 vs. 81, 68 to
112 μmol/l, P <0.001) in the renal TMA group compared
with patients in the non-renal TMA group. The TMA
group presented with more severe renal injury than the
control group.
Renal histopathological evaluation
Renal pathological parameters were then compared
between the two groups. The distribution of renal patholo￾gical types and the characteristics of renal histopathology
of the two groups were listed in Table 4. The proportion
of Class IV was significantly higher in the renal TMA
group than that in the non-renal TMA group (83.3% vs.
58.0%, P = 0.006). In comparison with the non-renal TMA
group, patients with renal TMA had significantly higher
scores of total AI (P <0.001), endocapillary hypercellualrity
(P <0.001), subendothelial hyaline deposits (P = 0.003),
interstitial inflammation (P = 0.005), glomerular leukocyte
infiltration (P = 0.006), total CI (P = 0.033), tubular atro￾phy (P = 0.004) and interstitial fibrosis (P = 0.018), respec￾tively. Also, the results indicated more active and chronic
renal involvement in patients with renal TMA.
Treatment and outcome
Lastly, the therapy algorithm and long-term outcomes
were analyzed between the two groups. The treatment and
outcomes of renal TMA and non-renal TMA patients
were detailed in Table 5. The ratios of patients using
plasma exchange and methylprednisolone pulse were sig￾nificantly higher in TMA group than that in non-TMA
group (P <0.001, P <0.001, respectively). The renal TMA

patients presented with significant lower ratios of partial
remission (33.3% vs. 58.0%, P = 0.01) and higher ratios of
treatment failure (44.4% vs. 15.2%, P <0.001) compared
with the non-renal TMA group.
In our cohort study, the lupus patients with renal TMA
were followed up for a period of 53 ± 64 months (range 6
to 240 months). The patients without renal TMA were
followed up for a period of 53 ± 44 months (range 6 to
282 months). During the similar follow-up time, the
relapse rate showed no significant difference between the
two groups.
The long-term survival was similar between the two
groups. But the renal outcome was significantly poorer in
the TMA group (P = 0.005, Figure 1). In the TMA group
(Group 1), no patients died or reached ESRD, but 10
patients reached the doubling of serum creatinine. In the
non-TMA group (Group 2), one patient died, no patient
reached ESRD and seven patients reached the doubling
of serum creatinine.
Using the log-rank test for univariate survival analysis of
renal prognosis in all the patients with lupus nephritis, we
found that renal TMA was a risk factor for renal outcome
in lupus nephritis (P = 0.009). Other univariate risk factors
included sex (male, P = 0.01), serum creatinine value
(P <0.001), proteinuria (P = 0.032), total activity indices
score (P = 0.001) and total chronicity indices score (P
<0.001) (Details in Table 6). Multivariate analysis revealed
that renal TMA (HR: 2.772, 95% confidence interval: 1.009
to 7.617, P = 0.048) and serum creatinine value (HR:
1.003, 95% confidence interval: 1.002 to 1.005, P <0.001)
were independent prognostic factors for renal survival
(Additional file 3, Table S1). With further analysis, we
found that the patients with both C4d deposition and
decreased serum factor H (Group 1) presented with higher

pathological AI scores (13.44 ± 3.78 vs. 9.89 ± 3.95,
P = 0.024) and poorer renal outcome (P = 0.007, Figure 2)
compared with those without the combination in the
TMA group (Group 2).
Taking the above results together, although with more
intensive immunosuppressive therapy, patients with
TMA had a poorer renal outcome, especially those with
both C4d deposition and decreased serum factor H,
than those without renal TMA.
Discussion
The prevalence of renal TMA, including acute and chronic
changes, in our cohort with lupus nephritis was 24.3% (36/
148), which was higher than that in previous studies (0.5%
to 10%) [2,24]. The most possible reason might be that
our diagnosis was based on the strict histopathological cri￾teria, not just clinical evaluation, which might increase the
ratio. In fact, diagnosis of TMA in SLE is sometimes diffi￾cult because these two disorders share similar clinical fea￾tures, including anemia, thrombocytopenia, neurological
deficits, renal involvement and fever. Therefore, the patho￾logical criteria should be regarded as the “gold standard”
in patients with SLE.
As reported in the previous studies [25-27], patients
with both renal TMA and lupus nephritis in our center
presented with more severe renal injury features, includ￾ing a higher amount of proteinuria, higher value of
serum creatinine, higher scores of total AI indices,
endocapillary hypercellualrity, cellular crescents, suben￾dothelial hyaline deposits, interstitial inflammation, glo￾merular leukocyte infiltration, total CI indices, tubular
atrophy and interstitial fibrosis in pathological evalua￾tions, compared with the patients without TMA.
Although with more intensive immunosuppressive ther￾apy, patients with TMA had a poorer renal outcome
than those without renal TMA. Renal TMA was found
as an independent risk factor for renal outcome in lupus
nephritis.
The pathogenesis of renal TMA in lupus nephritis
remains unclear and may be multifactorial, which might
be attributed to APS, TTP-HUS, malignant hypertension,
pregnancy, scleroderma, drugs and so on. Thus, we
further investigated the above risk factors in the 36 renal
TMA patients. Interestingly, only seven patients were
found with clear reasons, including two with TTP-HUS,
two with APS, two with malignant hypertension and one
with scleroderma. The other 29 patients only presented
with pathological evidence of renal TMA.
It is suggested that immune complex-mediated com￾plement activation via the classical pathway plays a key
role in the pathogenesis of tissue injury in lupus nephritis
[28-30]. C4d is produced mainly through the classical
complement activation cascade and can covalently bind
to glomerular endothelial surfaces and basement mem￾branes through the thiol ester site [31]. Recently, Danielle
et al. [5] and Shen et al. [32] found that positive C4d
staining in glomeruli correlated with the development of
renal microthrombi and demonstrated that activation of
the complement classical pathway might be a crucial fac￾tor in the development of TMA in lupus nephritis. In our
study, we also found that a high ratio (19/36) of patients
had C4d deposition on vessels in patients with renal
TMA. Li et al. [33] recently reported that C4d deposition
in peritubular capillaries was closely related with low
serum C4 level and higher disease activity of lupus
nephritis. It is possible that although it intend to clear
the immune complexes, the activation of complement
classical pathway may further cause the inflammation
and injury of the endothelium. Because C4d is also
involved in the lectin pathway, we cannot exclude the
possibility that C4d deposition partly reflects activation
of the mannose-binding lectin (MBL) pathway, which
needs further investigation.
Although it has been suggested that the development of
SLE, especially lupus nephritis, is closely associated with
immune complex-induced complement activation via clas￾sical pathways, recent studies [34] demonstrated that acti￾vation of the alternative complement pathway could
accurately reflect disease activity and the ongoing activation

paralleled with flares in patients with SLE, and the alterna￾tive pathway might play an important role in complement
activation-induced self-injury and inflammatory response in
SLE [35]. Further studies suggested that patients with
deficiency of complement regulators, such as complement
factor H, of the alternative pathway, was susceptible to SLE
[36-38]. A recent study has shown that factor H deficiency

prone mice MRL-lpr [39]. As mutations and single nucleo￾tide polymorphisms (SNPs) in complement factor H have
been implicated in a variety of human pathological condi￾tions, especially atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome
(aHUS), one of the reasons for TMA, we further detected
concentrations of serum factor H in our patients. Interest￾ingly, nearly half of the patients in our renal TMA group
were found with decreased serum complement factor H.
Complement factor H is a fluid phase complement regula￾tor of the alternative complement pathway [40,41]. It can
bind to endothelial cells and protects them from being
attacked by the complement system. It is suggested that
dysfunction or reduced levels of serum factor H may cause
endothelial cell damage which may be followed by platelet
consumption, red cell damage and the final TMA [42]. The
potential reasons for lower factor H in renal TMA with
lupus nephritis, including autoantibodies against factor H
or factor H gene mutations, need further study.
Furthermore, we divided TMA patients into two groups
based on C4d deposition in the kidney and the value of
serum factor H, and found that the patients with both C4d
deposition and decreased serum complement factor H

presented with higher pathological AI scores and poorer
renal outcome. The results supported that over-activation
of both complement classic and alternative pathways
might aggravate TMA injury in lupus nephritis. Previous
studies also suggested that classic pathway activation can
recruit the potent components to further amplify genera￾tion of C3 and C5 activation products and alternative
pathway activation might hold the key to continuous tis￾sue damage via the amplification loop in kidney situ in
lupus nephritis [43].
Tissue factor is an inducer of thrombosis. Interest￾ingly, recent studies strengthened the idea that tissue
factor activation which can be induced by the activation
of complement, might be important in the pathogenesis
of TMA [44,45].
We also observed that the ratio of nephrotic syndrome
and the amount of proteinuria were both higher in the
TMA group than that in the pure lupus nephritis group.
As proteinuria might be a risk factor for thromboembo￾lism, owing to loss of plasma antithrombin III and activa￾tion of the coagulation system [46,47], further studies were
needed to confirm the pathogenetic role of proteinuria in
renal TMA.
Many studies, including experimental models [48,49]
and clinical observations [50], have shown complement
activation to be essential in TMA. So our findings hold
promise for complement inhibition as a therapeutic
approach in the further treatment of TMA with lupus
nephritis.
Conclusions
In conclusion, there were various causes of renal TMA
in lupus nephritis. TMA was an independent risk factor
for renal outcome in lupus nephritis. Our study high￾lights the status of both complement classic and alterna￾tive pathway activation in the pathogenesis of renal
TMA in lupus nephritis.
