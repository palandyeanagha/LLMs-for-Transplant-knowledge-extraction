Purpose: Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) depletion syndrome
(MDDS) encompasses a group of genetic disorders of mtDNA
maintenance. Mutation of RRM2B is an uncommon cause of
infantile-onset encephalomyopathic MDDS. Here we describe the
natural history of this disease.
Methods: Multinational series of new genetically confirmed cases
from six pediatric centers.
Results: Nine new cases of infantile-onset RRM2B deficiency, and
22 previously published cases comprised a total cohort of 31
patients. Infants presented at a mean of 1.95 months with truncal
hypotonia, generalized weakness, and faltering growth. Seizures
evolved in 39% at a mean of 3.1 months. Non-neurological
manifestations included respiratory distress/failure (58%), renal
tubulopathy (55%), sensorineural hearing loss (36%), gastrointest￾inal disturbance (32%), eye abnormalities (13%), and anemia (13%).
Laboratory features included elevated lactate (blood, cerebrospinal
fluid (CSF), urine, magnetic resonance (MR), spectroscopy),
ragged-red and cytochrome c oxidase–deficient fibers, lipid
myopathy, and multiple oxidative phosphorylation enzyme defi￾ciencies in skeletal muscle. Eight new RRM2B variants were
identified. Patients with biallelic truncating variants had the worst
survival. Overall survival was 29% at 6 months and 16% at 1 year.
Conclusions: Infantile-onset MDDS due to RRM2B deficiency is a
severe disorder with characteristic clinical features and extremely
poor prognosis. Presently management is supportive as there is no
effective treatment. Novel treatments are urgently needed.

INTRODUCTION
RRM2B (OMIM 604712) is a nuclear gene encoding the small
p53 inducible subunit (p53R2) of the ribonucleotide reductase
(RNR) complex. RNR is a heterotetramer1–3 composed of two
R1 subunits (encoded by RRM1), and two R2 (encoded by
RRM2) or p53R2 (encoded by RRM2B) subunits. RNR
localizes to the cytosol4 and reduces ribonucleotide dipho￾sphates to deoxyribonucleotide diphosphates, which is
important in keeping the mitochondrial deoxyribonucleotide
triphosphate (dNTP) pool replete. These dNTPs are then
thought to be relocated to the nucleus and mitochondria for
DNA synthesis.
Unlike nuclear DNA, which replicates during the S phase of
the cell cycle before mitosis, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is
synthesized throughout the nonproliferative phase (G0) and
thus requires a steady pool of dNTPs. Therefore, RNR exists
in two forms: that which supports de novo dNTP synthesis
during the S phase (composed of 2R1, 2R2 subunits) and that

which is responsible for maintenance of dNTP pools in G0
(composed of 2R1, 2p53R2). p53 is a tumor suppressor gene
that is activated during DNA damage. p53R2 is thought to
have two roles: provision of dNTPs for DNA repair following
nuclear DNA damage2 and also a “housekeeping role” in
maintaining dNTP pools needed for mtDNA replication
throughout the cell cycle in both dividing and nondividing
cells.5,6
Mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome (MDDS) encom￾passes a group of nuclear gene disorders affecting key
enzymes involved in the synthesis of mtDNA and its
replication. This includes several genes involved in either
mtDNA replication itself or in the synthesis of nucleosides
that are incorporated into mtDNA at the replication fork.7,8
MDDS is classically categorized into different phenotypic
subtypes, each with an expanding number of causative disease
genes. These phenotypes are myopathic (caused by mutations
in TK2, SLC25A4, MGME1), encephalomyopathic (RRM2B,
FBXL4, ABAT), hepatocerebral (TFAM, MPV17, DGUOK,
SUCLA2, SUCLG1), Alpers syndrome (POLG, TWNK),
and mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalomyopathy
(MNGIE) (TYMP, rarely POLG and RRM2B).6–9 Mutations of
RRM2B may be associated with several different phenotypes,
including infantile-onset MDDS caused by autosomal reces￾sive inheritance of biallelic pathogenic variants.3,5,10–16 Other
phenotypes include multiple mtDNA deletions in children
and adults that are caused by either autosomal recessive
inheritance of biallelic pathogenic variants or autosomal
dominant inheritance of a single pathogenic variant,17–21
Kearns–Sayre syndrome,19 MNGIE,22 and, most recently,
acute liver failure.23
We describe nine new cases of infantile-onset encephalo￾myopathic RRM2B MDDS, reporting their detailed pheno￾type, investigations, treatment, and outcome. Taken together
with a further 22 published cases, we describe the natural
history of 31 patients with infantile RRM2B deficiency.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient cohort
Nine new patients were recruited from three centers in the
UK, two centers in the United States, and one center in
France. Patients were included if they had confirmed biallelic
RRM2B variants and an infantile-onset clinical phenotype,
and were not previously published. Data were collected
retrospectively by clinicians in each center using a standar￾dized questionnaire. This study was approved by Great
Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH) as a clinical audit.
Molecular studies in new patients
Mitochondrial DNA copy number relative to nuclear DNA
was estimated and compared with age-matched normal
controls by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction
(PCR).24 For the UK cases, this was performed as described
previously except that the nuclear DNA probe was labeled
with Vic and the assays were performed simultaneously using
a PE7500 real-time PCR instrument (Applied Biosystems,
Foster City, CA, USA). All exons and exon–intron boundaries
of RRM2B (GenBank accession number NM_015713.4, exons
1–9 numbered sequentially) were Sanger sequenced using
capillary electrophoresis in a 3730 DNA Analyzer (Applied
Biosystems). For probands in whom Sanger sequencing only
identified a single heterozygous pathogenic variant, RRM2B
exon copy number was assessed by multiplex ligation￾dependent probe amplification (SALSA MLPA P089-B1,
MRC-Holland, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). For two cases,
genetic diagnoses were obtained by genome sequencing in a
rapid genome sequencing project for critically ill infants.25 For
a further case, the causal RRM2B variants were identified by
exome sequencing as previously described.26
Literature search
We collected data from all published cases of infantile-onset
RRM2B-related MDDS by searching PubMed for relevant
publications. Search terms were “RRM2B” OR “ribonucleotide
reductase” OR “p53R2” with filters for English language
publications and human species (search completed 21
October 2018). This yielded 1948 publications including 10
papers containing relevant cases.
Statistical analyses
Stata software version 15 was used for all statistical analyses
(https://www.stata.com/). A P value < 0.05 was considered
statistically significant.
Modeling
FoldX server was used to model the new missense variants.27
RESULTS
Patient cohort
Nine previously unreported cases are included in our
multinational cohort (patients A–I). They presented with
symptoms at an average of 2.3 months (range 0–4 months).
Twenty-two further cases were identified from the literature
(patients 1–22), making a total of 31 cases of infantile-onset
RRM2B-deficient MDDS.3,5,10–16
Molecular analyses
Mitochondrial DNA studies
Residual mtDNA levels in skeletal muscle in the new cohort of
nine previously unreported infants with biallelic RRM2B
variants ranged from 2% to 20% (median 4.5%), which is far
below the accepted diagnostic limit of 30% for MDDS.28
Novel pathogenic RRM2B variants
We identified eight novel pathogenic RRM2B variants not
present in the gnomAD database (https://gnomad.broadinstitute.
org/gene/ENSG00000048392). These are c.599G>A p.Gly200-

p.His134Asp, and c.59C>G p.Ser20*. The six missense and
insertion variants are found in amino acid positions with a high

degree of evolutionary conservation across species (Clustal
Omega [http://www.clustal.org/]; see Supplementary Fig. 1 for
alignments, Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 2 for the biallelic
variants identified in the cohort); at these positions, the amino
acids of the human sequence are also shared by 65–96% of
RRM2B orthologs (n = 150 orthologs; data from Consurf).
The six nontruncation variants are distributed across the N￾terminal two-thirds of the RRM2B protein, a 351-residue
polypeptide (Fig. 1b). The crystal structure of human RRM2B
reveals a homodimer with an active site di-iron cofactor from
each monomer.1 Two variants, p.Ala61Pro and p.Gly200Glu,
result in marked changes to the amino acid side-chains, and
are predicted by the FoldX server to reduce protein stability
(ΔΔG 3.97 and 11.60 kcal/mol respectively). His134 is one
of the iron-ligating residues in the structure, hence the
p.His134Asp variant likely interferes with metal binding, and
is also predicted by FoldX to reduce protein stability (ΔΔG
6.50 kcal/mol). Glu105 is located at the dimer interface,
forming salt bridges with Arg40 and Arg121 from the
opposite dimer subunit. The p.Glu105Lys variant could

therefore interfere with structural integrity of the homodimer.
The p.Met55Ile and p.Gly212_Leu213insSer variants are
located at the protein exterior, away from the core active
centers; the effects of these substitutions are less clear from
the structure.
Disease course of nine new cases
The disease phenotype was multisystemic, with an initial
myopathic presentation followed by evolution of respiratory
distress and failure leading to assisted ventilation in all
cases. Multisystem involvement included the neurological,
renal, cardiac, respiratory, gastrointestinal (GI), and hemato￾logical systems, and the eyes, hearing, and growth. Table 1
and Fig. 2 detail the biochemical and histological findings.
Supplementary Fig. 3 illustrates the neurological, respiratory,
renal, and GI features and growth of the nine new cases.
Supplementary Fig. 4A–C illustrates the treatments adminis￾tered to the new cases, including respiratory support,
supportive feeding, and cofactor supplementation. Supple￾mentary Fig. 4D illustrates the survival outcomes for the new
cases. By 6 months 8/9 patients had already developed
respiratory failure and 6/9 had died. All nine patients died by
22 months. The causes of death are illustrated in Supple￾mentary Fig. 4E.
Natural history of cohort of 31 patients
Considering the entire cohort of 31 infants with RRM2B
deficiency, median age of symptom onset was 2 months
(mean 1.95 months, range 0–6 months). The most frequent
presenting features were muscular hypotonia, feeding
difficulty, failure to thrive, hearing loss, and respiratory
distress. The clinical phenotype was multisystemic. Neuro￾logical involvement occurred in all cases: encephalopathy in
15/31 (48%), seizures in 12/31 (39%) presenting at an
average age of 3.1 months (range 20 days–7 months),
respiratory involvement in 18/31 (58%), renal involvement
in 17/31 (55%), growth abnormalities in 16/31 (51%),
hearing loss in 11/31 (36%), GI involvement in 10/31 (32%),
eye abnormalities in 4/31 (13%), and anemia in 4/31 (13%)
of cases. The most consistent biochemical abnormality was
elevated lactate seen in blood, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and
urine, followed by elevated alanine and mildly elevated
creatine kinase. The most frequent skeletal muscle
histopathological features were COX-deficient fibers, abnor￾mal lipid deposition, and ragged-red fibers. The most
frequent oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) biochemical
abnormalities in muscle were decreased activities of
complexes I, III, and IV with compensatory increases in
both complex II and citrate synthase activities. Neuroima￾ging most frequently showed a structurally normal brain,
and less frequently evidence of demyelination, white matter
abnormality, or generalized atrophy (Table 2). Elevated
lactate peak was frequently observed on magnetic resonance
(MR) spectroscopy. Detailed clinical, biochemical, and
radiological features of all 31 cases are summarized in
Table 2.
Survival outcomes for the cohort were poor. A
Kaplan–Meier survival curve of all 31 cases of RRM2B￾associated infantile MDDS (Fig. 3) shows that survival at
3 months was 64.5% (20/31), at 6 months 29% (9/31), at
1 year 16% (5/31), and at 2 years 6% (2/31).
Phenotypic correlations
Mitochondrial DNA content
Patients with lower residual mtDNA levels in skeletal muscle
tended to die earlier, however this observation did not meet
statistical significance (Spearman rank test, p = 0.06). There was
no statistically significant correlation between residual mtDNA
content and age of onset (Spearman rank test, p = 0.44) or
number of organ systems affected (Spearman rank test,
p = 0.14). We compared patients who developed seizures (12/
31) as a subgroup with patients who did not develop seizures
(19/31) and noted no difference in average mtDNA levels
between these two groups (Mann–Whitney U test, p = 0.85).
Similarly, we noted no significant difference in average residual
mtDNA levels in patients who developed renal disease (n = 17)
compared with those who did not develop renal disease
(n = 14) (Mann–Whitney U test, p = 0.29).
Age of onset of symptoms
Infants presenting earlier appeared to die earlier, however,
this did not reach statistical significance (Spearman rank test,
p = 0.07). There was no correlation between age of onset and
number of organs affected (Spearman rank test, p = 0.20,
nor between age of onset and development of seizures
(Mann–Whitney U test, p = 0.88). Interestingly patients who
developed renal disease presented earlier (median age of onset
for patients who developed renal disease was 2 months versus
3 months for those without renal disease, Mann–Whitney U
test, p = 0.01*).
Age of death
There was no correlation between age of death and number of
organs affected (Spearman rank test, p = 0.42), nor between
age of death and occurrence of seizures (Mann–Whitney U
test, p = 0.56). Patients with renal disease tended to die
earlier, however this did not reach statistical significance
(Mann–Whitney U test, p = 0.07).
Genotype–phenotype correlations
Patients were divided into two groups based on genotype.
Group 1 included seven patients whose pathogenic variants
are expected to result in the formation of only truncated
messenger RNA (mRNA), which is likely to be subject to
nonsense-mediated decay (five with biallelic nonsense var￾iants [patients 1–3, 21, 22], one with biallelic frameshift
variants [patient 19], and one compound heterozygote with a
nonsense variant and a splice site variant [patient I]). Group 2
patients included the remaining 24 patients whose variants
are not expected to result in the formation of solely truncated
mRNA (15 patients with biallelic missense variants
[patients A, B, D, G, H, 6, 8, 11, 13–18, 20], 3 compound

heterozygotes with a missense variant and a splice site variant
[patients 4, 5, 12], 3 compound heterozygotes with a missense
variant and a truncating variant [patients C, 9, 10], 2 patients
with biallelic in-frame insertions [patients E, F], and 1
compound heterozygote for a missense variant and an in￾frame deletion [patient 7]).
Group 1 patients had a worse prognosis than group 2.
Median age of death was 2.5 months for group 1 compared
with 5 months for group 2 (Mann–Whitney U test, p =
0.002**). There was no statistically significant difference
between age of onset or number of organs affected between
the two groups (Mann–Whitney U test, p = 0.33 and 0.16
respectively), nor any correlation between genotypic group
and development of seizures (Chi squared test, p = 0.53) or
renal disease (Chi squared test, p = 0.31).
DISCUSSION
Here we have shown that infantile MDDS due to biallelic
RRM2B variants presents in the very first months of life with
hypotonia, poor feeding, and faltering growth leading to
hospitalization. Elevated blood and CSF lactate may be the
clue to an underlying mitochondrial disease, prompting
multisystem assessment revealing involvement of other
organs, frequently including sensorineural hearing loss
(SNHL) and renal tubulopathy/nephrocalcinosis. Infants
may also develop GI symptoms such as recurrent vomiting/
reflux. All deteriorate with respiratory insufficiency/failure
leading to assisted ventilation. Generalized seizures may
develop later in the disease course. This infantile clinical
phenotype is distinct from pediatric and adult-onset disease
associated with multiple mtDNA deletions due to recessive
(biallelic) and dominant (heterozygous) RRM2B variants,
where progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO), ptosis,
and proximal muscle weakness are the most frequent features

classically described as encephalomyopathic,6 encephalopathy
was seen in 15/31 cases (49%) and seizures were observed in
only 12 infants (39%). It is possible that some patients died
due to severe myopathy before the development of encepha￾lopathy or indeed that they would never have developed
encephalopathy. Incomplete penetrance of neurological
features is seen in other genetic causes of MDDS, e.g.,
infantile-onset DGUOK deficiency where individuals may
develop liver disease, which can be fatal, or go on to develop
multisystemic disease with additional brain involvement
including encephalopathy. Conversely in our cohort, renal
tubulopathy was seen in 17/31 (55%) of cases, and SNHL in
12/31 (39%). The high incidence of renal tubulopathy in
infants with MDDS is reminiscent of the phenotype of the
rrm2b−/− exon 3 and 4 deletion mouse model in which renal
failure is the most prominent feature and cause of death.29
Mutational analysis of the new patients in our cohort
revealed that several variants seen in patients with infantile
MDDS have also been seen in children and adults with
multiple mtDNA deletions presenting with PEO and myo￾pathy. This confirms previous reports suggesting that
missense variants may behave recessively (homozygous or
compound heterozygous) as well as in a heterozygous
dominant negative manner in different individuals. The
presence of normal p53R2 protein in cases of heterozygosity
may not always rescue the presence of mutated p53R2, owing

to a dominant negative effect that may be mediated by
disruption of normal allosteric interactions between the
heterotetrameric subunits of the RNR complex.21
In this study we sought to determine whether there are any
phenotypic and genotype–phenotype correlations in RRM2B￾associated MDDS. This is important for prognostication for
affected infants and in future may enable assessment of
suitability for candidate therapies. As MDDS is defined as
residual mtDNA <30% of age-matched healthy controls, all of
the patients met this criterion.28 In this natural history study,
we investigated whether mtDNA quantification can be used
not just in diagnosis but also in predicting severity of disease.
As it was not possible to apply a specific scoring system, for
example the Newcastle Paediatric Mitochondrial Disease Scale
(NPMDS), in entirety to each patient, the markers of severity
of disease that we analyzed in this study were age of onset,
presence of seizures, number of organs affected, and survival.
Taken pairwise, no statistically significant correlation was
seen between these markers of disease severity and mtDNA
quantification. Nevertheless, important trends were revealed:
earlier disease onset tended to be associated with presence of
renal disease later in the disease course and an earlier
mortality. While there was no statistical correlation between
the presence of seizures and age of death, for the 12 patients
in the cohort who did develop seizures, death followed after
an average of 2.9 months (median 1.2 months, range
0–15 months) after the appearance of seizures, defining a
point of significant clinical deterioration in the disease course.
Therefore, we suggest that the presence of seizures indicates
significant brain involvement and therefore severe disease.
When we grouped patients into two variant subgroups we
found that patients with biallelic variants resulting in
truncated transcripts had a relatively shorter survival
compared with patients with missense/in-frame insertion/
deletions resulting in formation of mRNA transcripts that are
aberrant but not subject to degradation by cellular nucleases.
This finding was statistically significant despite a small cohort
and is consistent with our findings for other natural history
studies in mitochondrial disease.30
It should be noted that there is a limitation of using age of
death as a marker of disease severity since in some cases death
followed redirection of care after recognizing futility of treatment.
Severe disease may paradoxically be associated with a longer than
expected lifespan, owing to prolonged artificial ventilation.
Another consideration is that meaningful correlation between
percentage mtDNA levels and genotype based on protein
truncation could not be determined due to small numbers.
Finally, it is assumed that the formation of truncated mRNA will
result in mRNA degradation and therefore little enzyme activity.
However, an exception to this has been demonstrated in
myocytes of adult patients with exon 9 deletions where mRNAs
escaped nonsense-mediated decay and western blots showed
persistent presence of truncated protein.17
We have demonstrated that patients with biallelic variants
resulting in truncated mRNA transcripts have the poorest
prognosis overall. This is an important finding in terms of
prognostication and appears to be the most robust
genotype–phenotype correlation. The prognosis overall how￾ever is extremely poor, with a six-month survival of 29% and a
one-year survival of 16%, underscoring the need to find new
effective treatments.
In RRM2B deficiency, inability to reduce ribonucleotide
diphosphates to deoxyribonucleotide diphosphates (dNDPs)
results in mtDNA depletion. For a different form of myopathic
MDDS, thymidine kinase 2 (TK2) deficiency, it has been
proposed that bypassing the defective step of nucleoside
salvage by supplementation with deoxyribonucleotides may
represent a therapeutic strategy for MDDS. This has been

trialed in tk2-deficient mice with some success. A combination
of orally supplemented deoxycytidine monophosphate
(dCMP) and deoxythymidine monophosphate (dTMP)
delayed disease onset and prolonged survival but did not
prevent death in a knock-in model of tk2 deficiency.31
Deoxyribonucleotide monophosphates appeared able to cross
the immature blood–brain barrier before P13 but further
development of the blood–brain barrier after P13 was likely to
account for central nervous system (CNS) disease at P29 and
ultimate death despite therapy. Similar results were seen with
oral supplementation with deoxycytidine (dC) and deoxythy￾midine (dT) in mice with tk2 deficiency, which is thought to
be due to compensatory upregulation of the cytosolic enzymes
tk1 and dck.32 For RRM2B deficiency, in vivo studies using a
suitable animal knockout model are yet to be undertaken,
since the existing animal model does not effectively recapitu￾late human disease.29
For RRM2B deficiency, in vitro studies of supplementation
with deoxynucleosides in cultured human cells yielded contra￾dictory results. RRM2B-deficient patient fibroblasts do not
express mtDNA depletion in culture unless they are exposed
to ethidium bromide or prolonged serum starvation.33
Deoxynucleoside supplementation increased intracellular
dNTP pools and normalized mtDNA synthesis in ethidium
bromide–treated quiescent patient fibroblasts harboring a lethal
homozygous missense RRM2B variant.34 However, in a second
study, supplementation with deoxynucleotide monophosphates
(dNMPs) in cultured myotubules/myoblasts from another
patient was ineffective in restoring mtDNA copy number.35 In
vivo delivery of all four deoxyribonucleosides via any route has
not been investigated in any model of MDDS. Furthermore, the
CNS penetrance of systemically delivered deoxyribonucleosides
in humans is unknown. The half-life of adenosine is extremely
brief when delivered intravenously and there is a risk of toxicity
since adenosine induces atrioventricular node blockade. It is
clear that in the presence of many unknowns, detailed
pharmacodynamic, pharmacokinetic, and efficacy studies in a
knockout animal model of RRM2B deficiency that effectively
recapitulates neurological disease seen in humans will be
essential to answer these questions.
Prior to designing a clinical trial for an experimental
treatment for RRM2B-related infantile MDDS in humans, it
will be necessary to determine at which time point CNS
involvement is considered irreversible. This should consider
both the natural history of disease in humans and the optimal
timepoint for effective drug delivery in preclinical drug trials
using an appropriate animal model. Difficult decisions will
need to be made in the advent of experimental therapies as to
whether a specific patient is deemed to have reversible disease,
especially since conventional neuroimaging is often normal
early on in infants who have quite severe functional
neurodisability, and seizures are not universally seen.
However, in cases for which there are structural abnormalities
on neuroimaging or prolonged/refractory electrical or clinical
seizures, we suggest that CNS disease has progressed beyond
the point of reversibility.
Whether or not irreversible disease should be treated with an
experimental treatment ought to be considered on a case-by￾case basis utilizing existing ethical frameworks. This is
predicated on determining whether the disease-modifying
treatment is likely to improve the quality of life rather than
just prolonging life. The Royal College of Paediatrics and Child
Health have provided an ethical framework that states that the
best interests of the child need to be considered to “determine
whether or not there is an overall benefit in prolonging life
because of the adverse impact entailed.”
36 The ethical implica￾tions of prolonging life with long-term ventilation in the context
of commencement of an experimental therapy need to be
weighed carefully against those of redirection of supportive care.
Indeed, long-term ventilation may be requested as a bridge to
emerging or experimental therapies and its use in this setting is
difficult to evaluate.37 An ethics committee should be called
upon to meet to assess the individual clinical case considering
the opinion of the infant’s parents and available second
opinions provided by other clinical teams.
It is clear that the natural history of infantile-onset RRM2B
MDDS is characterized by rapid neurological disease progres￾sion. Prompt diagnosis is essential for optimal management of
these infants, particularly avoidance of prolonged invasive
ventilation as currently there are no effective disease-modifying
therapies for this and most other mitochondrial diseases.38 In
the future, if a clinical trial of a disease-modifying therapy is to
be undertaken, clinical and ethical discussions regarding
suitability for trial recruitment of the affected infant need to
commence soon after a genetic diagnosis is made.
To facilitate more rapid diagnosis, we suggest that where
there is a high index of clinical suspicion indicated by a
combination of several of the following six features: hypotonia
developing insidiously after birth, renal tubulopathy, sensor￾ineural hearing loss, feeding difficulty, muscle weakness, and
respiratory failure, targeted single-gene sequencing for
RRM2B should be prioritized over muscle biopsy and exome
sequencing. Where the index of clinical suspicion is lower,
that is, when only a few of these features are present, the
differential diagnosis includes potentially treatable disorders
such as spinal muscular atrophy,12 benign reversible infantile
respiratory chain deficiency disorders,39 congenital myopa￾thies, and other causes of MDDS, e.g., TK2 deficiency. In this
scenario a rapid exome sequencing approach with considera￾tion of early muscle biopsy is more appropriate. Of note,
creatine kinase levels are normal or only mildly elevated in
RRM2B deficiency effectively distinguishing this disorder
from myopathic MDDS due to TK2 deficiency.40
Conclusions
Infantile-onset RRM2B-related MDDS should be suspected in
cases where mtDNA depletion has been demonstrated in an
infant with a combination of encephalomyopathy, respiratory
failure, and renal or hearing impairment. The majority of
infants are already symptomatic with hypotonia and faltering
growth well before presentation with respiratory failure to
emergency medical services. The disease evolves relentlessly

with a one-year survival of 16%. Biallelic truncating variants
predict the worst survival outcome. While awaiting a genetic
diagnosis there is evolving brain injury, implying a narrow
therapeutic window for treatment with disease-modifying
therapies, should these become available. The usefulness of
deoxyribonucleoside supplementation remains to be eluci￾dated in an animal model that adequately recapitulates
human neurological disease before considering clinical trials
in humans.
