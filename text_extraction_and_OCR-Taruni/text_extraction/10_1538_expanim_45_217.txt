Abstract: We compared palpation and electrocardiograms (ECG) as methods of evaluation
of acute rejections, and also studied the mode of expression of rejection from histological
findings by means of a cervical heart transplantation model in LEW strain rats with (LEW x
BN) F1 rats as donors. Evaluation by palpation mainly involved changes in the intensity of
the beat of the transplanted heart. With this method, it was also possible to observe changes
in the size of the graft, and to investigate these changes over time. Unlike with abdominal
heart transplants, the time of cardiac arrest can be clearly determined without any influence
from the heart rate of the recipient. But with the ECG evaluation method, it was possible to
distinguish clearly between the waveforms of the graft and the recipient waveforms unlike with
the conventional lead method. In histological findings, the time of transfer of infiltrating cells
into the graft and the time of appearance of CD8 positive cells matched the times when
changes occur in the intensity of the beat and in the heart rate seen with palpation. Unlike the
palpation and ECG methods, however, these findings are not suitable for evaluation of the
time of cardiac arrest of the graft. The graft survival time was 6.1 + 0.6 days (n=73) by
palpation and 8.5 + 1.8 days (n=73) by ECG. Since the graft survival time was significantly
longer in the ECG evaluation than in the evaluation by palpation (P<0.001), it appeared better
to use these methods independently rather than concurrently in consideration of their
features. Histological examination appeared to be useful in experimental systems for
clarification of the mode of expression of the acute rejection after its has occurred.

Palpation is a very simple method for evaluation of
acute rejection in heterotopic heart transplantations in
rats, and there have also been reported combinations of
palpation and electrocardiograms [1], but the results are
not always in agreement in reports on graft survival time
in heart transplants using the (LEW-BN) F1l-LEW com-
bination [2, 4, 13]. Factors affecting graft survival time
in heterotopic heart transplantation in rats include both
genetic and environmental factors, as well as technical
factors such as transplantation methods and methods of
evaluation of acute rejection. We have also reported
that the graft survival time is greatly affected by differ-
ences in graft site and the age of the animals [9, 10]. We

therefore decided to investigate methods of evaluation of
acute rejection by considering such methods as one of
the factors which affect graft survival time.

In the present study, were compared the features of
the palpation and ECG methods and the graft survival
times in a cervical heterotopic heart transplantation

age weighing 154-330 g and LEW/SsN (RTI!) male
and female rats at 7 to 21 weeks of age weighing 210-
335 g.

Transplantation method: Seventy-three LBNF1 rats
served as donors and their hearts were grafted into
LEW/SsN rats. The cervical heart transplantation was
performed according to the method of Kobayashi et al.
[7]: after thoracotomy under ether inhalation anesthe-
sia, the donor heart was removed. The heart graft was
rapidly cooled and flushed with 5 m/ of lactated Ring-
ers solution (4°C) containing 200 U/ml heparin, and
infused via the aorta and pulmonary artery. The heart
graft was preserved in lactated Ringers solution at 4°C.
The cuff was prepared from an intravenous cannula
(PORTEX Co., Ltd.) and was then anastomosed in the
cervical region of the recipient with arterial (O/D 1.02

mm, length 3.6 mm, 3FG) and venous cuffs (O/D 1.65
mm, length 3.6 mm, 5FG) (Fig. 1). The total ischemic
time for the donor operation and vascular anastomoses
should not exceed 30 to 35 min. All procedures are
performed under clean but not aseptic conditions.

Evaluation of acute rejection:

1) Palpation: Cessation of grafted heart beating was
determined without anesthesia. Evaluation of acute re-
jection was examined by directly touching the skin above
the cervical grafted heart with the fingers and feeling the
intensity of heart beats transmitted via the fingers (Fig.
2). The intensity of heart beats was classified into four
grades (—to 3+) (Table 1). The grafted heart was pal-
pated once a day at the same time until it stopped
beating. The graft survival time was determined the
previous day, when the grafted heart stopped beating.

was attached to the side of the vascular anastomosis and the left foot (LF) lead was
attached to the apex side. The left arm (LA) and right foot (RF) leads were attached
in the ordinary manner.

2) Electrocardiogram (ECG): The basic limb lead
method was slightly modified by using a multi-factor
electrocardiograph (CARDIMAX EX-3301, Fukuda
Denshi Co., Ltd.) under ether inhalation anesthesia. The
right arm electrode was attached to the side of the vas-
cular anastomosis and the left foot one was attached to
the apex side. The left arm and right foot leads were
attached in the ordinary manner (Fig. 3). Evaluation
was based on the presence of a regular waveform ap-
pearing at ECG lead II, and graft survival time was
determined the previous day, when the waveform dis-
appeared at ECG lead II.

The ECG was performed immediately after and 1, 3
and 5 days after grafting and once a day at the same
time until the heart stopped beating. The heart rate was
calculated from the R-R interval at II lead of the ECG.

3) Histological and immunohistological examinations

The histological and immunohistological studies were
performed 1, 3, 5 and 6 days after grafting. HE stain-
ing was performed after fixation in 10% formalin buffer.
Immunohistological samples were embedded in OCT
compound, treated in liquid nitrogen and then kept at
—80°C. The fluorescent antibody double staining
method with PE labeled OX-38 (CD4*; helper T cells)
and FITC labeled OX-8 (CD8*; cytotoxic suppressor T

cells) as the monoclonal antibodies (Dainippon Pharma-
ceutical Co., Ltd.) was used for the immunohistological
examination.

Statistical analysis:

Differences between the ECG evaluation group and
the palpation group in the mean survival time were
statistically analyzed by Student’s -test.

1. Changes in graft beating detected by palpation

With palpation, the transplanted hearts showed no
changes in the beat intensity or size from just after
transplantation until the 3rd day after transplantation,
and a very strong simple beat (3+) was maintained.
From the 4th post operative day, the size and hardness
of the heart increased slightly, and the beat seemed
weaker (2+). There were further increases in size and
hardness before cardiac arrest, and the beat was very
weak (+).

Strong and elastic beats (3+) were observed in about
80% of grafts until the 3rd day, but by the 4th day this
was down to 21%. On the 6th transplantation day, the
beat was faint (+) in almost all rats, and in some of the

(Table 2).

2. Changes in graft beating detected by electrocardio-
grams (ECG)

The ECG immediately after grafting was observed
together with the ordinary heart waveforms of the re-
cipient at the I and III leads. At lead II, only the
waveform of the transplanted heart was observed, and
was different from that of the recipient’s heart (Fig. 4).
The high-potential ECG waveform continued until the
3rd day (Fig. 5-a, b, c). Even though cessation of the

beating was confirmed by palpation on the 6th post
operative day, regular waveforms were still observed
by the ECG, but they were clearly different from ordi-
nary beating patterns (Fig. 5-d). Afterwards, the
waveforms of the recipient’s proper heart were observed
at leads I and III, but no waveform of the grafted heart
was found at lead Ill (Fig. 5-e).

3. Changes in the graft heart rates
The mean heart rate on the ECG immediately after

transplantation was less than 300 beats/min, but was
maintained at over 300 beats/min from the following

day to the 3rd day. On the Sth day, heart rates rapidly
decreased to 260 beats/min, and heart dysfunction due
to acute rejection was suspected. Although the heart
beats could not be confirmed by palpation on the 6th
day, a heart rate of 166 beats/min was monitored by
ECG (Table 3).

4. Graft survival time

The graft survival time was 6.1 + 0.6 days for palpa-
tion and 8.5 + 1.8 days for ECG, i.e. graft survival time
was significantly longer in the evaluation by ECG than
in that by palpation (P<0.001).

5. Histological examination

Mild cellular infiltration around the epicardium on
the Ist day after transplantation was confirmed by a
histological examination of the transplanted hearts (Fig.
6-a).

On the 3rd day, severe cellular infiltration was seen
around the epicardium and around the blood vessels in
the myocardium (Fig. 6-b). On the Sth day to the day
before cardiac arrest, degeneration, desquamation and
vacuolization of the cardiomyocytes, as well as necro-
sis, were observed (Fig. 6-c, d).

dium on the Ist day after the transplantation (Fig. 7-a).
On the 3rd day, CD8 positive cells appeared and they
became predominant until the Sth day (Fig. 7-b, c). A

few CD4 positive cells were found around the blood
vessels in the myocardium on the Ist day after the trans-
plantation (Fig. 7-a). On the Sth transplantation day ,
as CD4 positive cells decreased, CD8 positive cells
became predominant to the same degree (Fig. 7-c).

Discussion

 

We observed the acute rejection in cervical heart
transplantation in rats by means of palpation and ECG,
and also examined the mode of expression of acute
rejection by using histological findings with the aim of
establishing an evaluation method.

We first observed the beat intensity and morphologi-
cal changes such as size in the transplanted hearts by
palpation, and evaluated the rejection time by prepar-
ing criteria from these changes. At the same time, we
evaluated the time of rejection from waveforms ap-
pearing on ECGs by using an electrocardiograph. The
mode of expression of the acute rejection was also stud-
ied histologically and immunohistologically.

Koga et al. [8] evaluated acute rejection in abdominal
heart transplantation in rats by scoring the color, hard-
ness, contractility, etc. of the graft after transplantation,
but these criteria did not evaluate the time of cardiac
arrest. Chapman et al. [3] reported that it is difficult to
distinguish between the intensity of the beat of the graft
before cardiac arrest and the pulse of the recipient.

Our evaluation method depends mainly on observing
the intensity of the beat of the graft occurring due to
the acute rejection. By also observing the degree of
enlargement and hardness of the graft, it was possible
to examine changes with time. The time of cardiac
arrest of the graft could also be accurately evaluated
with no effects on the recipient beat unlike in the case
of abdominal heart transplantation.

When ECGs were used to evaluate acute rejection,
however, it was very difficult to make evaluations by
the conventional lead method since the waveforms of
the transplanted heart and those of the proper heart of
the recipient appear superimposed on the ECGs. It was
impossible to differentiate clearly between the two
waveforms by the lead method. The main characteris-
tic of the lead method was that the graft waveforms
could be differentiated at lead II of the ECG. Changes
with time in the QRS waveform on the ECG due to
size and heart rate could also be obtained. Since the
waveforms at lead II are the graft waveforms, it may be
possible to use a simple A-B lead method in the future.

Objective evaluation was possible when compared with
palpation, but waveforms which differed from the ordi-
nary graft beat were obtained and evaluation of the time
of cardiac arrest was not as clear as that by palpation.


EVALUATION OF REJECTION IN RAT CARDIAC ALLOGRAFT 225

The ECG method also required anesthesia of the ani-
mals and the use of instruments, and a long time is
required for evaluation because of the many observa-
tions required in experimental systems such as the
screening of immunosuppressants. This method is
therefore more complex than simple palpation.

Since there are obvious differences in graft survival
times in the evaluation of acute rejection by palpation
and ECGs, it is considered impossible to use the two
methods concurrently in the evaluation of graft sur-
vival times. It therefore appeared better to use each
method separately in evaluation of graft survival time
rather than the combined palpation and ECG method
proposed by Abbott er al. [1], Chapman e¢ al. [3] and
Heron et al. [5].

In histological and immunohistological findings, cell
infiltration in the graft was very clearly expressed
subepicardially on the day following transplantation,
and it was found to shift to the myocardium from the
3rd to the 4th day after transplantation. This phenom-
enon was almost the same as that reported by Nakajima
et al. [12]. Among the lymphocyte subsets in the infil-
trating cells, CD4 positive cells appeared first
subepicardially and around the myocardial blood ves-
sels from the day after the transplantation, and CD8
positive cells then appeared from the 3rd or 4th day.
The time of this shift in infiltrating cells and the time
of the appearance of CD8 positive cells matched the
time of the appearance of changes in beat intensity and
heart rate detected by palpation. Chapman et al. [3]
also found a correlation between histological changes
and voltage activity in the ECGs, but histological and
immunohistological methods are not suitable for evalu-
ation of the actual time of cardiac arrest unlike the
palpation and ECG methods.

When the usefulness of these evaluation methods was
considered on the basis of the findings in this study, it
appeared better to use these methods independently rather
than concurrently in consideration of their features. But
when palpation is appropriate for experimentation sys-
tems to evaluate the antirejection effects of
immunosuppressants and other agents which require a
reliable evaluation of the time of cardiac arrest of the
graft because palpation is simple and accurate. ECG
evaluation, however, appeared to be suitable for experi-
mentation systems to evaluate electrical phenomena of

the myocardium such as the viability of preserved or-
gans. Histological examination appeared useful in
experimentation systems to clarify the mode of the acute
rejection after transplantation.
