Background: Little is known on factors predicting sunitinib toxicity. Recently, the condition of low muscle mass, named
sarcopenia, was identified as a significant predictor of toxicity in metastatic renal cell cancer (mRCC) patients treated with
sorafenib. We investigated whether sarcopenia could predict early dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) occurrence in mRCC patients
treated with sunitinib.
Methods: Consecutive mRCC patients treated with sunitinib were retrospectively reviewed. A DLT was defined as any toxicity
leading to dose reduction or treatment discontinuation. Body composition was evaluated using CT scan obtained within 1 month
before treatment initiation.
Results: Among 61 patients eligible for analysis, 52.5% were sarcopenic and 32.8% had both sarcopenia and a body mass index
(BMI)o25 kg m 2
. Eighteen patients (29.5%) experienced a DLT during the first cycle. Sarcopenic patients with a BMIo25 kg m 2
experienced more DLTs (P ¼ 0.01; odds ratio ¼ 4.1; 95% CI: (1.3–13.3)), more cumulative grade 2 or 3 toxicities (P ¼ 0.008), more
grade 3 toxicities (P ¼ 0.04) and more acute vascular toxicities (P ¼ 0.009).
Conclusion: Patients with sarcopenia and a BMIo25 kg m 2 experienced significantly more DLTs during the first cycle of
treatment.
Renal cancer accounts for more than 64 000 new cases per year in
the Unites States, and causes approximately 13 500 deaths yearly
(Siegel et al, 2012). Worldwide incidence and mortality rates are
rising at approximately 2–3% per decade (Gupta et al, 2008).
Sunitinib (Sutent; Pfizer, New York, NY, USA) is an orally active,
multi-targeted inhibitor of VEGFR1-3, PDGFR, KIT, FLT3, CSF-1
and RET (Chow and Eckhardt, 2007), approved for the treatment
of metastatic renal cell cancer (mRCC; Motzer et al, 2007).
Importantly, sunitinib-induced toxicities (mainly diarrhoea, hand￾foot syndrome, fatigue and hypertension) may limit the patient’s
ability to receive full-dose treatment. In the sunitinib arm of the
pivotal phase III trial, these toxicities resulted in dose reductions in
50% and treatment termination in 19% of the patients (Motzer
et al, 2009).
Little is known on factors predicting sunitinib toxicity.
Polymorphisms in CYP3A5 (rs776746) might identify a subset of
patients prone to toxicity-related dose reductions (Garcia-Donas
et al, 2011). However, these polymorphisms are not routinely
assessed in daily practice.
Recently, the condition of low muscle mass, named sarcopenia
(Cruz-Jentoft et al, 2010; Fearon et al, 2011), has been studied
in cancer patients, in whom sex-specific cut-off values based on
mortality risks have been determined (Prado et al, 2008).

treated with sorafenib (an orally active multi-kinase inhibitor
that targets BRAF, RET, PDGFR-b, VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2
(Wilhelm et al, 2006)), in particular those with a body mass index
(BMI)o25 kg m 2 (Antoun et al, 2010a). As well, sarcopenia
predicts treatment-induced toxicity in hepatocellular carcinoma
patients treated with sorafenib (Mir et al, 2012).
The purpose of the present analysis was to investigate whether
sarcopenia could predict the occurrence of early dose-limiting
toxicities (DLTs) in mRCC patients treated with sunitinib.
We hypothesised that an increased toxicity would be observed in
sarcopenic patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Participants. We performed a retrospective, electronical, medical
record review of all consecutive mRCC patients treated with
sunitinib in our institution from June 2006 to March 2012.
Ethics. The study was approved by the local ethics board
according to good clinical practice and applicable laws, and the
declaration of Helsinki.
Treatment, toxicity and activity assessment. Adult mRCC out￾patients received sunitinib at a starting dose of 50 mg per day,
4 weeks/6, 37.5 mg continuous daily dosing (CDD) or 25 mg
CDD according to their Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
performance status (ECOG PS) and co-morbidities, at the
discretion of the treating physician, as described by other authors
(Escudier et al, 2009; Barrios et al, 2012). Toxicity was assessed at
each visit, every 2 weeks (or before if clinically indicated) during
the first cycle, then monthly.
In the case of grade 3 or 4 toxicity according to the National
Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria v3.0, sunitinib was
discontinued, except for patients with grade 3 hypertension in
whom antihypertensive drugs were introduced according to
current guidelines (Izzedine et al, 2009). Depending on toxicity
resolution, sunitinib was resumed at full dose or at decreased doses,
or permanently discontinued, at the discretion of the treating
physician.
A DLT was defined as any toxicity leading to a dose reduction,
temporary or permanent discontinuation of treatment. Following
the design of a previous study (Prado et al, 2009), only DLTs
occurring during the first cycle of treatment were examined for the
present analysis. A cycle of treatment was determined as a period
of 6 weeks.
Treatment activity was assessed every two cycles by CT scan, or
before if clinically indicated, according to RECIST v1.0 (Therasse
et al, 2000).
Anthropometric measurements. Weight was measured with a
medical balance beam scale, and height was measured with a
stadiometer. The BMI was calculated (weight (kg)/height2 (m2
))
and the World Health Organization categories were used: under￾weight, BMIo18.5; normal, 18.5pBMIp24.9; overweight,
25pBMIp29.9; obesity, BMIX30. Body surface area (BSA) was
calculated using the Mosteller formula: BSA (m2
) ¼ ((height
(cm)  weight (kg))/3600)1/2.
Image analysis. Body composition was evaluated by assessing
muscle tissue areas on CT-scan images, as previously described
(Heymsfield et al, 1997; Mitsiopoulos et al, 1998). CT scans had
been performed for diagnostic or follow-up purposes within no
more than 30 days before initiation of sunitinib. Images were
analysed using ImageJ software v1.42q (National Institutes of
Health, http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij). The third lumbar vertebra (L3)
was chosen as a standard landmark, as previously described
(Antoun et al, 2010a). Muscles were identified based on their
anatomic features, and the structure of those specific muscles was
quantified based on pre-established thresholds of skeletal muscle
tissue (  29 to þ 150 Hounsfield units; Mitsiopoulos et al, 1998).
Cross-sectional areas (cm2
) of the sum of all of these muscles were
computed and the mean value for two consecutive images was
computed for each patient. These values were normalised for
stature (Mourtzakis et al, 2008; Prado et al, 2008) and expressed in
units of cm2 m 2
. The sex-specific cutoff values for sarcopenia
(55.4 cm2 m 2 for males and 38.9 cm2 m 2 for females) deter￾mined in cancer patients were used as done by others in mRCC
patients (Antoun et al, 2010a). The total lumbar–skeletal muscle
cross-sectional area is linearly related to the whole-body muscle
(Shen et al, 2004; Mourtzakis et al, 2008) and the total lean body
mass (LBM) was estimated from muscle cross-sectional areas as
described by Mourtzakis et al (2008): LBM (kg) ¼ (0.30  (skeletal
muscle area at L3 using CT (cm2
)) þ 6.06). As the body
composition analysis was done a posteriori, treating physicians
were blinded to patients’ body composition status (sarcopenic
or not).
Statistical analysis. Prevalence of toxicity was compared using
Fisher’s exact test, and Mann–Whitney’s test was used for the
comparison of continuous variables. All P-values were two-sided,
and the level of significance was Po0.05. Multivariate analysis of
factors predicting early DLTs was conducted using logistic
regression with 3000 bootstrap iterations, including only factors
predicting the occurrence of DLTs with a P-valueo0.05 by
univariate analysis. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall
survival (OS) were measured from the date of first treatment
administration to the date of disease progression or death for the
former, and the date of death for the latter. Kaplan–Meier

estimates of the distribution of times from baseline to outcome
were computed, and the groups were compared using the log-rank
test. Calculations were performed with NCSS 2007 software (NCSS,
Kaysville, UT, USA).
RESULTS
Patients’ characteristics. From June 2006 to March 2012, 84
mRCC patients received sunitinib, among which 61 (73%) met all
criteria for study analysis (Figure 1).
Baseline characteristics of patients treated with sunitinib are
presented in Table 1. Briefly, 32 patients (52.5%) were sarcopenic
and 20 (32.8%) were sarcopenic, and had a BMI o25 kg m 2
. The
variables needed to assign a Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer
Center (MSKCC) risk score were missing for 11 patients, and those
needed to assign a Heng score were missing for 15 patients. Some
patients could be correctly assigned even with some missing data;
for the others the most likely values were derived.
Sunitinib toxicity. Eighteen patients (29.5%) experienced a DLT
during the first cycle of treatment (Table 2). In all cases but two,
patients had multiple toxic effects of grade 2 and/or 3. Sunitinib
was discontinued and resumed either at the same dose in three
cases (16.5%) or at a lower dose in eight cases (44.5%). For the
seven remaining patients (39%), sunitinib was permanently
discontinued. Table 2 shows therapy adjustments and the duration
of subsequent sunitinib treatment after the occurrence of a DLT
(median for the whole cohort: 31 weeks, range 6–150). Sunitinib
was resumed in 40% of patients with sarcopenia and low BMI (for
a median duration of 33 weeks, range 16–85), and in 75% of

range 6–150), P ¼ 0.06.
The comparison of anthropometric parameters between patients
with or without early DLT is summarised in Table 3. Significant
differences were observed regarding age (P ¼ 0.006), weight
(P ¼ 0.007), BSA (P ¼ 0.004), LBM (P ¼ 0.006) and skeletal muscle
L3 index (P ¼ 0.02). No difference was found regarding BMI or
sarcopenia. The prevalence of DLT did not significantly differ
in patients receiving 50 mg, 4 weeks/6, or CDD o50 mgper day
(P ¼ 0.31).
The comparison between patients with both sarcopenia and
BMI o25 kg m 2 with the remaining patients is summarised in
Table 4. No difference was found regarding the starting dose,
ECOG PS at beginning of treatment or classification according to
the MSKCC risk group. Figures 2A and B illustrate the distribution
of BMI, muscle index and early DLT for men and women,
respectively. Overall, sarcopenic patients with BMI o25 kg m 2
experienced significantly more DLTs (P ¼ 0.01; odds ratio ¼ 4.1;
95% CI: (1.3–13.3)), more cumulative grade 2 or 3 toxicities
(P ¼ 0.008) and more grade 3 toxicities (P ¼ 0.04) during the first
cycle. Permanent termination of sunitinib during the first cycle
occurred in 30% of these patients compared with 2.4% of the
remaining patients (P ¼ 0.01). Of note, acute vascular toxicities
(microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia, thrombotic microangio￾pathy or reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome) were
more frequent during the first cycle of treatment in this subset of
patients (P ¼ 0.009). By multivariate analysis, the combination
of sarcopenia and BMIo25 kg m 2 was the only independent
predictor of early DLTs (P ¼ 0.04).
Survival analysis. The median PFS and OS for the study
population (n ¼ 61) were 9.0 (95% CI: 6.4–11.8) and 22.1 months
(95% CI: 14.0–26.0), respectively. No significant differences were
observed between patients with sarcopenia and BMIo25 kg m 2

Sarcopenia and sunitinib toxicity BRITISH JOURNAL OF CANCER

considering sarcopenic and non-sarcopenic patients, no significant
differences were observed regarding PFS (P ¼ 0.71) or OS
(P ¼ 0.75).
DISCUSSION
This retrospective analysis is the first evaluating the relationship
between sarcopenia and early toxicity in patients treated with
sunitinib for mRCC. We found that patients with sarcopenia and a
BMIo25 kg m 2 experienced significantly more DLTs, more
cumulative grade 2 or 3 toxicities and more grade 3 toxicities
during the first cycle.
Baseline characteristics of patients included in this analysis were
similar to those observed in previous studies in mRCC patients
(Antoun et al, 2010a,b). Indeed, sarcopenic patients and sarcopenic
patients with low BMI represented 52.5% and 32.8%, respectively,
of all patients in the present cohort. A high proportion of patients
experienced early DLTs, probably reflecting the toxicity profile of
sunitinib in less-selected patients than those included in clinical
trials. We found that low skeletal muscle area (and, therefore,
low LBM) was significantly associated with the occurrence of early
DLTs (P ¼ 0.006), but sarcopenia per se was not predictive for early
DLTs (P ¼ 0.17).
Antoun et al (2010a) observed that BMIo25 kg m 2 associated
with sarcopenia was a significant predictor of toxicity in mRCC
patients treated with sorafenib. Hence, further analyses combining
sarcopenia with low BMI were pre-planned. This subset of patients
was found to be at particular risk of DLT during the first cycle,
with 50% of patients experiencing a DLT, compared with 19.5%
among other patients (P ¼ 0.01). This difference was related to
the occurrence of more cumulative grade 2 or 3 toxicities, more
cumulative grade 3 toxicities and more acute vascular toxicities.
The sum of several toxicities, which were not individually dose
limiting, lead to permanent termination of sunitinib in six patients
(30%) with sarcopenia and BMI o25 kg m 2
, compared with only
one patient (2.4%) in the remaining group (P ¼ 0.003).
Remarkably, the excessive toxicity observed in patients with
sarcopenia and BMI o25 kg m 2 did not translate into a
significantly poorer PFS or poorer OS. The first explanation could
lie in the fact that, following the occurrence of a DLT sunitinib was
resumed in up to 40% of patients with sarcopenia and low BMI, for
a median time of 33 weeks (range 16–85).
The second potential explanation is that efficient second-line
treatment was given to five of the seven patients in whom sunitinib
had been permanently withdrawn.
The excessive toxicity in patients with both sarcopenia and low
BMI observed in this series is in line with previous findings,
indicating that both conditions underlie a particular vulnerability
to various anti-cancer agents.
An association between low BMI and increased toxicity has been
reported in a population of 45 patients (85% with mRCC) treated
with sunitinib (Telli et al, 2008). In this population, grade 3 or
4 cardiotoxicity was associated with low BMI (mean 23.9 kg m 2
vs 27.1 kg m 2
; P ¼ 0.03).
Sunitinib toxicity has also been associated with low BSA
(a variable conditioned to height and weight, similar to BMI) in 82
advanced RCC patients treated with sunitinib (van der Veldt et al,
2008). In this population, DLTs occurred in 37 patients and were
significantly related to low BSA (P ¼ 0.005). Interestingly, low BSA
was also significantly associated with early DLT (P ¼ 0.002) in the
present series.
Sarcopenia is associated with an increased toxicity
of 5-fluorouracil (Prado et al, 2007), capecitabine (Prado et al,
2009), epiribucin (Prado et al, 2011) and sorafenib (Mir et al,
2012). Sarcopenia is also associated with poorer survival for obese
patients with solid tumours of the lung or gastro-intestinal tract
(Prado et al, 2008), and with increased propensity for nosocomial
infection and other complications (Cosqueric et al, 2006).
Finally, an increased toxicity could also be linked to higher drug
exposure, in the same way it has been suggested for hepatocellular
carcinoma sarcopenic patients treated with sorafenib (Mir et al,
2012). Indeed, in the phase I trial of sunitinib (Faivre et al, 2006)
most patients with DLT had combined sunitinib and SU012662
(sunitinib major metabolite) through plasma concentrations
X100 ng ml  1
.
The main limitations of our study are its retrospective nature
and the relatively small number of patients included, which could
potentially have biased survival analyses. However, our findings
have potentially direct bedside implications, as evaluating
sarcopenia on CT scan and BMI calculation are feasible in daily
practice. This would enable closer follow-up of patients at risk and,

therefore, avoid severe toxicities by early dose adjustments or
therapeutic interventions when needed.
Conversely, patients devoid of sarcopenia and BMI
o25 kg m 2 could probably be treated with full-dose sunitinib
without excessive risk, even when ECOG PS exceeds 1.
In conclusion, our results highlight the importance of assessing
body composition, and suggest that the combination of sarcopenia
and low BMI predicts early DLTs in mRCC patients treated with
sunitinib.
