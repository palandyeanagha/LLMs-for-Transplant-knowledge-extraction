Abstract
Background: Recent studies have indicated that microRNA-223 (miR-223) plays a role in the tissue-protective
effect of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). NLR family-pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) was reported to
affect a renal ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury by exerting a direct effect on the renal tubular epithelium.
Therefore, we investigated how miR-223 and NLRP3 might function in kidneys exposed to conditions of
ischemia and subsequent reperfusion.
Methods: Hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) murine renal tubular epithelial cells (RTECs) were cocultured with
either MSCs or hypoxia-pretreated MSCs (htMSCs), after which the RTECs were examined for their viability
and evidence of apoptosis. Next, miR-223 expression in the MSCs was downregulated to verify that MSCs
protected RTECs via the transport of miR-223. Kidney I/R KM/NIH mouse models were created and used for
in vivo studies.
Results: The results showed that coculture with MSCs significantly increased the viability of RTECs and decreased their
rates of apoptosis. The levels of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), transforming
growth factor beta (TGF-β), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in samples of coculture supernatants were
higher than those in samples of non-coculture supernatants. A bioinformatics analysis revealed a targeting relationship
between miR-223 and NLRP3. A dual luciferase assay showed that miR-223 inhibited NLRP3 expression. The htMSCs
displayed a protective function associated with an upregulation of miR-223 as induced by Notch1 and the
downregulation of NLRP3. Conversely, inhibition of miR-223 impeded the protective effect of MSCs. In the
I/R mouse models, injection of either MSCs or htMSCs ameliorated the damage to kidney tissue, while suppression of
miR-223 expression in MSCs reduced their protective effect on mouse kidneys.
Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that miR-223 and NLRP3 play important roles in the treatment of renal tissue
injuries with transplanted MSCs.

Background
Renal blood flow is always temporarily disrupted during
various surgical treatments, including those performed
for the purposes of kidney transplantation, partial neph￾rectomy, aortic bypass, and treatment of sepsis [1–4].
Although the re-initiation of blood flow to ischemic kid￾ney regions restores their function, the restoration
process itself can further damage kidney tissue, resulting
in an ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury [5]. Patients who
are hospitalized due to acute renal failure caused by an
I/R injury have high rates of morbidity and mortality. In
recent years, considerable effort has being made to im￾prove the treatment of renal I/R injuries, and a variety of
agents and growth factors have been proven effective for
treating these disorders. However, most of these treat￾ment modalities were validated in animal models, and
no significant efficacy was demonstrated in human clin￾ical trials [6]. Therefore, the development of novel and
effective strategies for managing and treating renal I/R
injuries remains a high priority.
In recent years, several studies have demonstrated that
mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) may help attenuate or
prevent an I/R injury in multiple organs, including the
kidney, and may exert that effect via paracrine/autocrine
mechanisms or transdifferentiation into local cell types
[7–10]. MSCs are multipotent cells capable of differenti￾ating into various types of specialized mesenchymal cells
such as osteoblasts, chondrocytes, adipocytes, and teno￾cytes [11]. MSCs are easier to culture than embryonic
stem cells (ESCs) and other adult stem cells [8], and
their functional properties make them promising candi￾dates for use in tissue engineering studies and as
agents for treating various diseases, including renal I/
R injuries [11]. Semedo et al. [12] showed that MSCs
could modulate I/R injuries in renal tissue by inhibit￾ing inflammatory responses. Rosova et al. [13] proposed
that the beneficial effects of MSCs could be primarily
attributed to their ability to mediate complex paracrine
actions. Moreover, MSCs were shown to improve the
recovery of I/R-injured rodents even if they were in￾fused starting at 24 h after the injury, which suggests
that MSCs actively participate in repairing I/R-injured
tissues [13–15].
The mechanism by which MSCs protect kidney tissue
is complicated, and may involve the paracrine/autocrine
effects of cytokines, their transdifferentiation into the
local cell type, and/or immunomodulation [8, 16]. A pre￾vious study showed that administration of MSCs into a
DCD rat kidney alleviated kidney tissue damage [17].
Moreover, recent evidence suggests that the NLR family￾pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome may
upregulate cytokine production and play a critical role in
renal injuries [18]. NLRP3 may also contribute to renal
I/R injuries by directly affecting the renal tubular
epithelium [19]. Given that NLRP3 is negatively regu￾lated by microRNA-223 (miR-223) [20], an enhanced ex￾pression of miR-223 might be expected to ameliorate the
damage to renal tissues. The cardioprotective effect of
MSCs is mediated through exosomal miR-223. More￾over, Notch receptors expressed in MSCs were proven
to be upstream regulators of miR-223 [21, 22]. There￾fore, we hypothesized that MSCs might exert their
protective function by suppressing NLRP3 via Notch￾induced activation of miR-223. We then tested our
hypothesis in a series of in vitro and in vivo assays.
The effect of MSC administration and the role of miR￾223/NLRP3 signaling in renal I/R injuries were exam￾ined using hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) murine renal
tubular epithelial cells (RTECs), and were then verified
in a renal I/R KM/NIH mouse model. Our results not
only verified the protective effect of MSCs on kidney tis￾sue, but helped explain the mechanism by which MSCs
limit the extent of I/R injuries.
Methods
Preparation of cells
Murine RTECs were purchased from Zhongqiaoxinzhou
Cell Research (Cat. No. M4100; Shanghai, China) and
cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium
(DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum
(FBS) and penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C in a 5% CO2
atmosphere. MSCs were generated from bone marrow
tissue extracted from the femurs of sacrificed mice, and
suspended in sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).
The extracted cells were then resuspended in DMEM,
filtered through 70-μm mesh lattice, and plated in flasks
containing DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS
(Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). After
72 h of culture, any nonadherent cells were removed,
and the adherent cells were passed at a low density into
new flasks. Cells that displayed a typical spindle-shaped
appearance were used for subsequent assays.
Induction of the H/R RTEC model and coculture
To detect the effect of MSCs on miR-223/NLRP3 ac￾tivity, the RTECs were divided into the following four
groups: 1) RTEC group (normal RTECs); 2) HR RTEC
group, (H/R-treated RTECs); 3) HR RTEC + MSC
group (H/R-treated RTECs cocultured with MSCs for
48 h); and 4) HR RTEC + htMSC group (H/R-treated
RTECs cocultured with hypoxia-pretreated MSCs
(htMSCs) for 48 h).
To detect the role of the miR-223/NLRP3 pathway in
renal I/R injuries, the RTECs were divided into the fol￾lowing two groups: 1) Negative control group (H/R￾treated RTECs cocultured with MSCs transfected with
negative control inhibitors); and 2) miR-223 inhibitor
Yuan et al. Stem Cell Research & Therapy (2017) 8:146 Page 2 of 13

group (H/R-treated RTECs cocultured with MSCs trans￾fected with a miR-223-specific inhibitor).
For the H/R treatment, RTECs were plated into six-well
plates and exposed to H/R conditions as previously de￾scribed [23]. Briefly, the RTECs were inoculated at con￾centrations of 5 × 105 cells per well and incubated in
DMEM culture medium containing 10% FBS. To
synchronize cell growth, the culture medium waschanged
to serum-free DMEM at 24 h before treatment. Next, the
ischemia/hypoxia medium (glucose; 10,000 mg/L) was
added to the cells, and the plates were put into double￾layered, sealed, self-styled bags with an anaerobic indica￾tor. The bags were then filled with low-oxygen gas (5%
CO2, 95% N2) to expel the air. When the purple anaerobic
indicator turned red, the bag was sealed to maintain the
anaerobic condition for 2 h, after which oxygen was added
to the bag and the medium was changed to DMEM with
FBS for further incubation. Hypoxia treatment has been
reported to improve the therapeutic efficacy of MSCs [13].
For hypoxia pretreatment of MSCs, the cells were cul￾tured in 12-well plates with DMEM supplemented with
10% FBS, 50 μg/mL penicillin, and 50 mg/L gentamicin
(Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) prior to being cocultured
with RTECs. Each parameter examined in the following
assays was measured in at least three identical samples. A
double-chamber coculture system was used for cell cocul￾ture. The system was separated into upper and lower
chambers by a 0.4-μm pore-size membrane (12-well in￾sert; BD Biosciences. Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). RTECs
(1 × 105 cells/well) were cultured in the lower chamber
and MSCs or htMSCs (1 × 105 cells/well) were cultured in
the upper chamber. Cells were harvested after 24 h, 48 h,
and 72 h of culture, respectively.
Creation of renal I/R mouse models and transplantation
of MSCs
Twenty-four KM/NIH mice (female, 34 ± 2.1 g) were
used for in vivo assays and were randomly assigned to
four different groups (six mice per group): 1) Control
group (mice underwent I/R treatment and were abdom￾inally intravenously injected with the same volume of
normal saline as used for negative control groups); 2)
MSC group (15 min before I/R treatment the mice were
abdominally intravenously injected with 2 × 106 MSCs in
a volume of 200 μL and then transfected with a negative
control inhibitor); 3) miR-223 inhibitor group (15 min
before I/R treatment the mice were abdominally intra￾venously injected with 2 × 106 miR-223 knockdown
MSCs); and 4) htMSC group (15 min before I/R treat￾ment the mice were abdominally intravenously injected
with 2 × 106 hypoxia-pretreated MSCs). For induction
of the renal I/R model, mice were anesthetized with
isoflurane and their rectal temperature was main￾tained at 37 °C. After a midabdominal laparotomy,
the kidneys were exposed and the renal pedicles were
clamped with atraumatic vascular clamps for 60 min.
While the clamps were applied, the left carotid artery
was cannulated with PE-50 tubing to allow for
intraaortic cell delivery immediately after blood flow
was reestablished. All mice were sacrificed at 24 h
after their operation.
Transfections of MSCs
MSCs (1 × 105
) were seeded into six-well plates (18 rep￾lications). Transfection or hypoxic stimulation was per￾formed until the cells reached 70–80% confluence. A
miR-223-specific inhibitor (sequence: 5′-ACAGUCAAA
CAGUUUAUGGGUU-3′) or negative control (sequence:
5′-UGCGCUGCUGGUGCCAACCCUAUUCU-3′) pur￾chased from Jikai Biosciences (Shanghai, China) was
transfected into the MSCs using Lipofectamine 2000 re￾agent (Thermo Fisher Scientific Waltham, MA, USA)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. At 24 h
posttransfection, the MSCs were harvested and used for
coculture with RTECs. The knockdown effect in the
MSCs lasted for 96 h.
Dual luciferase assay
Full length NLRP3 mRNA (mNLRP3) 3′-untranslated
region (UTR) was inserted into the psiCHECK-2 lucifer￾ase reporter vector to construct psiCHECK-2-mNLRP3-
wt. The mutated form of mNLRP3 3′-UTR was used to
construct psiCHECK-2-mNLRP3-mut. ViaFect™ Trans￾fection Reagent (Promega, Fitchburg, WI, USA) was
used to cotransfect 1 μg of psiCHECK-2-mNLRP3-wt or
psiCHECK-2-mNLRP3-mut with 50 nm/L miR-223
mimic or miR-223 inhibitor into RTECs. Dual luciferase
activity was assayed 48 h later.
CCK-8 assay
The cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay was used to detect
RTEC proliferation in the different groups. Briefly,
RTECs in the coculture system were harvested at 24 h,
48 h, and 72 h, respectively, after which 100 μL of CCK8
solution (Dojindo Molecular Technologies, Gaithers￾burg, MD, USA) was added to each well. After 4 h of
incubation at 37 °C the optical density of each well at
450 nm was read with a microplate reader (Thermo
Plate, Rayto Life and Analytical Science C. Ltd.,
Shenzhen, Guangdong, China).
Flow cytometry assay
The apoptotic rates of RTECs sampled at 48 h in the dif￾ferent groups were determined by flow cytometry. Cells
in different groups were collected after centrifugation at
600 g for 5 min, and their apoptotic rates were measured
using an Annexin V-FITC Apoptosis Detection Kit
(WLA001c, Wanleibio, Shenyang, China) according to
Yuan et al. Stem Cell Research & Therapy (2017) 8:146 Page 3 of 13

instructions provided by the manufacturer. Briefly, 5 μL of
Annexin V was added to different wells containing
RTECs. After a 10-min incubation with Annexin V at
room temperature, the cells were resuspended in 1 × bind￾ing buffer, and 5 μL of propidium iodide was added to
each sample. Next, the apoptotic rates were analyzed by
flow cytometry (Accuri C6, BD, San Jose, CA, USA). The
overall apoptotic rate (UR + LR—all apoptosis cell per￾centage) was equal to the sum of the late apoptotic rate
(UR, upper right quadrant—advanced stage apoptosis cell
percentage) and the early apoptotic rate (LR, lower right
quadrant—prophase apoptosis cell percentage).
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
The levels of renal protecting cytokines, including hep￾atocyte growth factor (HGF; Cat. No. E-EL-R0496c,
Elabscience-Biotech Co. Ltd., Wuhan, China), transform￾ing growth factor beta (TGF-β; Cat. No. CSB-E04727r,
Cusabio Biotech, Wuhan, China), insulin-like growth
factor-1 (IGF-1; Cat. No. CSB-E04582r, Cusabio Biotech,
Wuhan, China), and vascular endothelial growth factor
(VEGF; Cat. No. CSB-E04757r, Cusabio Biotech, Wuhan,
China) were measured using enzyme-linked immuno￾sorbent assay (ELISA) kits according to the manufac￾turers’ instructions. Serum blood urea nitrogen (BUN)
levels were detected using an ELISA kit manufactured
by Bio-Medical Assay, Beijing, China.
Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction
(qRT-PCR)
The total RNA in different cell samples at 48 h was
extracted using an RNA Purified Total RNA Extrac￾tion Kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions
(Cat. No. RP1201, BioTeke, Beijing, China). β-actin
and U6 were used as internal reference genes. Next,
Super M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Cat. No. RP6502,
BioTeke, Beijing, China) was used to reverse tran￾scribe samples of total RNA into cDNA templates.
Each 20 μL RT-PCR reaction mixture consisted of
10 μL Bestar® SybrGreen qPCR Master Mix, 0.5 μL of
each primer (miR-223, forward: 5′-ACACTCCAGCT

5′-AACGCTTCACGAATTTGCGT-3′), 2 μL cDNA tem￾plate, and 7 μL Rnase-free H2O. The amplification param￾eters were as follows: denaturation at 95 °C for 2 min,
followed by 40 cycles at 94 °C for 20 s, 58 °C for 20 s, and
72 °C for 30 s, after which the reaction was stopped by
lowering the temperature to 4 °C for 5 min. Relative ex￾pression levels of the targeted molecules were calculated
by an Exicycler™ 96 PCR system (Bioneer, Alameda, CA,
USA) using the 2–△△ct method.
Western blot assays
The total proteins in different groups were extracted
using a total protein extraction kit according to the
manufacturer’s instructions (Cal. No. WLA019,
Wanleibio, China). GAPDH was used as an internal
reference. The protein concentration in each sample
was determined using the BCA method. A 20-μL ali￾quot of protein (40 μg) was separated by electrophor￾esis on a 10% sodium dodecylsulfate polyacrylamide
gel. Following separation, the targeted proteins were
transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF; BD,
San Jose, CA, USA) sheets, which were then washed
with TTBS for 5 min prior to being incubated in a
powdered skim milk solution for 1 h. Primary anti￾bodies against NLRP3 (1:400, Santa Cruz Biotechnol￾ogy, Santa Cruz, CA, USA), Notch1 (1:1500, Santa
Cruz Biotechnology Santa Cruz, CA, USA), Bcl-2
(1:500, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA,
USA), Bcl-XL (1:1000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa
Cruz, CA, USA), caspase-1 (1:2000, Abcam, Cambridge,
MA, USA), caspase-3 (1:800, Abcam, Cambridge, MA,
USA), and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase
(GAPDH; 1:4000, Abcam; Cambridge, MA, USA) were in￾cubated with the membranes at 4 °C overnight. Following
incubation, the membranes were washed four times with
TTBS, after which secondary HRP goat anti-rabbit anti￾bodies (1:20,000, Cat. No. BA1054, Wuhan, China) were
added to the mixture and incubated with the membranes
for 45 min at 37 °C. After an additional six washes with
TTBS, the blots were developed using Beyo ECL Plus re￾agent, and the results were detected with a gel imaging
system. The relative levels of BDNF expression in the dif￾ferent samples were calculated using Gel-Pro-Analyzer
(Media Cybernetics, Rockville, MD, USA).
Immunofluorescence assays
RTECs which had received the different respective treat￾ments for 48 h were seeded into 14-well chambers,
washed with PBS, and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde
for 15 min. The cells were then permeabilized with 0.5%
Triton X-100 for 30 min. Next, the cells were washed
Yuan et al. Stem Cell Research & Therapy (2017) 8:146 Page 4 of 13

three times with PBS (5 min per wash), and blocked with
10% goat serum for 15 min. Primary rabbit polyclonal
antibodies to Notch1 (1:200, Santa Cruz Biotechnology,
USA) and NLRP3 (1:100, Santa Cruz Biotechnology,
USA) were then added, and the cells were incubated
overnight at 4 °C in 1% goat serum. The cells were then
incubated and stained with a fluorescein isothiocyanate
secondary antibody (goat-anti-rabbit-Alexa 594 conju￾gated antibodies, Life Technologies, USA) for 1 h.
Following incubation with the secondary antibody,
the cells were washed and then stained with 4,6-dia￾mino-2-phenyl indole (DAPI; Life Technologies,
USA) for 5 min at room temperature. After three 5-
min washes with PBS buffer, the slides were fixed
and imaged with a fluorescence microscope at × 100
magnification.
Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining
The histological changes in sections of kidney tissue
from the different groups were observed using H&E
staining. Briefly, the tissues were placed into Bouin’s so￾lution (4% formaldehyde) for perfusion fixation, after
which they were dehydrated using different concentra￾tions of alcohol and vitrified in dimethylbenzene. The
tissues samples were then embedded in paraffin, sec￾tioned, stained with H&E, and examined under a micro￾scope at × 200 magnification. Following H&E staining,
the cell nuclei were stained blue and cytoplasmic areas
were stained red.
Periodic acid-silver methenamine (PASM) staining
PASM staining was used as an optimal method for iden￾tifying the extracellular matrix in sections of renal tissue.
Briefly, tissues sections were stained in 1% acid periodic,
after which they were treated with an Ag-methenamine
solution and stained with AuCl. After staining, collagen
fibers appeared as dark strands against a pink
background.
Terminal deoxynucleoitidyl transferase-mediated nick-end
labeling (TUNEL) staining
The rates of cellular apoptosis in samples of renal tis￾sue were determined using TUNEL staining. Briefly,
tissue sections were permeabilized with 50 μL 0.1%
Triton X-100 at room temperature for 8 min. Next,
the sections were washed three times with PBS buffer
(5 min per wash) and then incubated in 3% H2O2 for
10 min at room temperature. After another three 5-
min washes in PBS buffer, the sections were covered
with TUNEL reaction solution and incubated at 37 °C
for 1 h in a darkened humidified chamber. Following
incubation, the sections were washed three times with
PBS buffer (5 min per wash), and then incubated with
Converter-POD at 37 °C for 30 min. The reaction
was then stopped, and the cells were restained with
hematoxylin. The stained renal tissues were then
examined under a microscope (CX41, Olympus,
Shinjuku, Tokyo, Japan) at × 200 magnification.
Immunohistochemical detection methods
Sections prepared from different tissue samples were
examined independently by senior pathologists, and
then immediately frozen for Notch1 detection. Tissue
slides to be used for immunohistochemical assays
were stored at 60 °C overnight, and then incubated
with dimethylbenzene for dewaxing. The slides were
then hydrated with different concentrations of alcohol
(100% for 5 min, 95% for 5 min, 85% for 5 min, and
75% for 5 min) and washed with H2O2 for 5 min.
Slides with tissue sections from different animals were
fixed using a methanol solution containing 3% H2O2,
and then blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin
(BSA) for 30 min at 37 °C. They were then incubated
at 37 °C for 30 min with a primary antibody against
Notch1 (1:200, Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA), before
being incubated at 4 °C overnight. After four cycles
of washing in 0.01 M PBS (5 min per cycle), a sec￾ondary antibody (goat-anti-rabbit-Alexa 594 conju￾gated antibody; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham,
MA, USA) was added to the slides, which were then
incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. After another four cy￾cles of washing in PBS, DAB was added to the slides
and reacted for 3–10 min until the reaction was
stopped by addition of ddH2O. The slides were then
restained with hematoxylin, dehydrated, and examined
under a microscope at × 200 magnification.
Creatinine clearance rate test
Urine was collected within 24 h after each operation and
the creatinine levels in plasma and urine samples were
detected with a creatinine assay kit (BioAssay Systems,
Hayward, CA, USA). The creatinine clearance rate (Ccr)
was calculated according to the Cockcroft-Gault for￾mula: (urinary volume (mL, 24 h) × urinary creatinine
(μmol/L))/(serum creatinine (μmol/L) × urine collection
length (min)).
Statistical analysis
All the data are expressed as means ± SD. One-way ana￾lysis of variance (ANOVA), ANOVA for repeated mea￾surements, and Duncan’s post-hoc test were all
performed using a general linear model. A P value < 0.05
indicated statistical significance. All the statistical ana￾lyses were performed using SPSS Statistics for Windows,
version 19.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA).

Results
Coculture of RTECs with MSCs increased the viability of
RTECs and suppressed their rates of apoptosis
H/R treatment of RTECs decreased their viability and
enhanced their rates of apoptosis (Fig. 1), while cocul￾ture with MSCs attenuated the effects of H/R. When
examined at 72 h, the difference in optical density
(OD450) values between H/R RTECs that were cocul￾tured with MSCs and H/R RTECs that were not cocul￾tured with MSCs was statistically significant (P < 0.05;
Fig. 1a). Similar differences were detected in the apop￾tosis rates of the two groups of cells (Fig. 1b). Moreover,
the cellular activity of RTECs treated with htMSCs at
72 h was higher than that of RTECs treated with normal
MSCs. This suggested that coculture with MSCs can
protect RTECs from H/R-induced injuries, and hypoxia
pretreatment of MSCs enhanced their protective effect.
Expression of miR-223 was upregulated in RTECs
cocultured with MSCs and htMSCs
The injuries induced by H/R decreased the miR-223
levels in RTECs (Fig. 2a). However, hypoxia treatment
increased the levels of miR-223 expression in both MSCs
(Fig. 2b) and RTECs (Fig. 2a). The levels of excreted pro￾tective cytokines HGF, IGF-1, TGF-β, and VEGF in the
supernatants of coculture medium were significantly in￾creased by treatment with MSCs when compared with
those in the RTECs and HR RTECs groups (P < 0.05;
Fig. 3a). Furthermore, the decreased expression levels of
all the antiapoptosis indicators (including Bcl-2 and Bcl￾XL) in the HR RTEC groups were restored after treat￾ment with htMSCs (Fig. 3b and c), while the expression
levels of proapoptosis indicators (including caspase-1
and caspase-3) were partially downregulated. The results
obtained after administration of MSCs indicated that the
MSCs had actively contributed to increasing the levels of
miR-223 in H/R RTECs.
Notch signaling in MSCs was initiated by hypoxia
pretreatment
The prosurvival mechanism of MSCs was further inves￾tigated at the molecular level. A bioinformatics analysis
verified existence of a complementary binding site be￾tween miR-223 and the 3′-UTR of NLRP3 mRNA
(Fig. 4a). A dual luciferase assay showed that treatment
with the miR-223 mimic significantly decreased the rela￾tive amount of luciferase activity (Fig. 4b), indicating
that miR-223 exerted a regulatory effect on NLRP3
mRNA. We also assessed the levels of NLRP3 expression
in RTECs obtained from the different groups. NLRP3
expression in RTECs was first induced by H/R treatment
and then suppressed in the cocultured groups (Fig. 4c
and d), and this pattern was synchronized with corre￾sponding changes in cell viability and apoptosis. The
promoting role of NLRP3 in an acute renal injury was
negatively regulated by miR-223. Because miR-223 se￾creted by MSCs is known to be transferred to RTECs via
a paracrine mechanism, we investigated the levels of
Fig. 1 Coculture with mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) increased cell
viability and suppressed apoptosis of renal tubular epithelial cells
(RTECs). RTECs were treated with hypoxia/reoxygenation (HR)

Notch1 expression in MSCs and found that Notch1
expression was significantly increased by hypoxia pre￾treatment (P < 0.05; Fig. 4e and f ). This suggests that
miR-223 in MSCs might be upregulated by Notch
signaling.
miR-223 contributed to the attenuation of H/R injuries in
RTECs by suppressing NLRP3 expression
To verify that miR-223/NLRP3 signaling plays a key role
in the kidney protective function of MSCs, we specific￾ally inhibited miR-223 expression in MSCs. We found
that the viability of cocultured RTECs became dramatic￾ally decreased concomitant with miR223 inhibition (P <
0.05; Fig. 5a), and the rates of RTEC apoptosis were
accelerated (Fig. 5b). At the same time, the levels of cell
protective cytokines (i.e., HGF, IGF-1, TGF-β, and
VEGF) in the coculture supernatants declined (Fig. 6a).
Moreover, the levels of antiapoptosis indicators also
declined due to the knockdown of miR-223, while the
expression levels of molecules known to promote apop￾tosis (i.e., caspase-1 and caspase-3) increased (Fig. 6b
and c). The downregulation of miR-223 in MSCs in￾duced NLRP3 expression, indicating that miR-223 plays
a key role in the mechanism by which MSCs protect
kidney tissue (Fig. 7a and b).
In vivo implantation of MSCs ameliorated kidney I/R
injuries via miR-223-mediated NLRP3 suppression
To verify our findings in the H/R RTEC model, an in
vivo renal I/R injury model was created using KM/NIH
mice. Samples of kidney tissue from the treated mice
were collected for RNA extraction. Next, qRT-PCR was
performed to measure the mRNA levels of several cyto￾kines. Mice injected with MSCs or htMSCs had in￾creased levels of cell protective cytokines (HGF, IGF-1,
TGF-β, and VEGF). The levels of those cytokines in
mice injected with miR-223 knockdown MSCs were sig￾nificantly lower than those in both the I/R + MSC and I/
R + htMSC groups (P < 0.05). However, even though the
miR-223 levels in MSCs had been reduced, the miR-233
levels in the I/R + MSC group were still higher than
those in the I/R group (Fig. 8a). These results confirmed

The degrees of kidney fibrosis were also reduced by ad￾ministration of functional MSCs (Fig. 9b). Additionally,
we also used an immunohistochemical assay to detect

(Notch1-positive cells were stained brown) (Fig. 9c),

response in I/R-injured kidney tissues. Our TUNEL
staining results showed that the numbers of apoptotic
RTECs were decreased after treatment with MSCs when
compared with those numbers in the I/R group. This
reduced level of apoptosis in the I/R + MSC group was
absent when miR-223 was inhibited. When compared
with the levels of apoptosis in the I/R and I/R + MSC
groups, a significant inhibition of apoptosis was found
after treatment with htMSCs (P < 0.05) (Fig. 9d). In a
similar manner, results of BUN assays also indicated that
treatment with MSCs or htMSCs significantly decreased
the levels of BUN, whereas suppression of miR-223 im￾peded the reduction in BUN induced by MSCs or
htMSCs (P < 0.05) (Fig. 9e). We also examined the cre￾atinine clearance rates in mice which received the differ￾ent treatments, and found that the creatinine clearance
rates were significantly increased in the I/R + MSC group
and were even upregulated in the I/R + htMSC group
(Fig. 9f ). Interestingly, downregulation of miR-223 signifi￾cantly reduced creatinine clearance rates in the I/R + MSC
group, indicating that miR-223 plays a role in the ability of
MSCs to treat I/R-induced kidney injuries.

Discussion
While therapies based on MSC transplantation have
been successfully used to alleviate injuries in liver, heart,
and renal models [13, 14, 24, 25], the underlying mecha￾nisms involved in the protective effect of MSCs on in￾jured tissues have never been fully understood. In the
current study, we demonstrated that administration of
MSCs could ameliorate kidney damage induced by I/R,
and the related mechanism involved inhibition of NLRP3
activity via activation of miR-223.
MicroRNAs comprise a group of endogenous short
noncoding RNAs which modulate the translation of tar￾geted messenger RNAs by binding to the 3′-UTR of the
targeted messenger RNA transcripts, thereby leading to
RNA degradation and inhibition of protein synthesis
[26]. In recent years, numerous associations between
renal I/R and specific miRNAs have been identified. Wei
et al. [27] found that deletion of Dicer in the proximal
tubular epithelium protected kidney tissue from I/R-in￾duced injuries, and this effect was correlated with
changes in the expression of specific miRNAs [27].
Moreover, in a unilateral warm renal ischemia model
created in mice, nine miRNAs were found to be differen￾tially expressed in the ischemic kidneys when compared
with the control kidneys [28]. Our previous studies
showed that the protective effect of MSCs on a DCD rat
kidney was associated with activation of miR-223, as well
as the specific suppression of its targeted gene, NLRP3.
Therefore, it was reasonable to hypothesize that miR￾223 plays a key role in I/R-induced injuries to the
kidney, as well as the ability of MSCs to protect kidney
tissue. For the following reasons, this hypothesis was val￾idated in the current study: 1) RTECs from an induced
H/R model displayed significantly decreased levels of
miR-223 expression in vitro; and 2) knockdown of miR￾223 in MSCs impaired the treatment effect of MSCs on
RTECs in vitro, and on renal I/R mice in vivo. A previ￾ous study reported that MSCs secrete exosomes capable
of transporting miR-223 into nearby cells for the pur￾pose of regulating targeted pathways [24]. In the present
study, results obtained after the coculture of MSCs with
RTECs without physical contact partially confirmed that
idea. After administration of MSCs alone, the levels of
miR-223 in RTECs dramatically increased. Moreover,
miR-223 appeared to affect the amounts of growth fac￾tors and chemokines secreted by MSCs. It was note￾worthy that suppression of miR-223 decreased HGF,
IGF-1, TGF-β, and VEGF production both in vitro and

signaling in the mouse kidney. a Representative images of hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained tissue sections (×200). Administration of MSCs

significantly decreased the levels of BUN compared to those in the IR group; however, a decrease in miR-223 expression reversed the reductions
in BUN caused by MSCs or htMSCs. f The creatinine clearance rates were elevated in both the IR + MSC and IR + htMSC groups. The loss of miR￾233 alleviated the increase in creatinine clearance caused by MSCs or htMSCs. a

in vivo. Because secretion of these polypeptides contrib￾utes to the ability of MSCs to help increase epithelial
proliferation and modulate inflammation or angiogen￾esis, those polypeptides can be considered as therapeutic
candidates for treating renal injuries [29–31]. Taken
together, the central role played by miR-223 during the
onset of a renal I/R injury was affirmed. Thus, the
upregulation of miR-223 in kidney tissues by therapeutic
modalities such as MSCs is a promising method for
treating renal failure induced by an I/R process.
Our current study investigated the mechanism by
which miR-223 functions as a key mediator between
MSCs and RTECs. Previous studies have shown that
Notch1 receptors are expressed in MSCs, which were
proven to serve as upstream regulators of miR-223
[21, 22]. Thus we investigated the relationship be￾tween Notch1 expression and miR-223 levels in
MSCs. As it has been demonstrated that hypoxia￾treated MSCs can initiate Notch signaling [32], we
found that the levels of miR-223 expression in MSCs
were significantly increased. Those results proved the
positive correlation between miR-223 expression and
activation of Notch1.
Thereafter, we investigated the levels of miR-223 target
gene (NLRP3) expression in both RTECs and kidney tis￾sue [20, 33]. Nod-like receptors are crucial signaling
regulators involved in the formation of intracellular
macromolecular complexes, and contribute to host im￾mune responses [34]. Shigeoka et al. [19] showed that
NLRP3 promoted tissue injury by exerting a direct effect
on the renal tubular epithelium in an inflammasome￾independent manner [19]. Our study showed that upreg￾ulated levels of NLRP3 were closely associated with in￾duction of an I/R injury both in vitro and in vivo. At the
molecular level, enhanced NLRP3 activity contributed to
the onset of inflammation by increasing caspase-1 levels
[35], and to the initiation of mitochondrial pathway￾mediated apoptosis by increasing caspase-3 levels and
decreasing Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL levels [36]. Administration
of MSCs suppressed the function of NLRP3 both in
RTECs and kidney tissues, whereas knockdown of miR￾223 blocked the effect of MSCs. These findings indicate
that MSCs protect RTECs and kidney tissue by inhibit￾ing NLRP3 via miR-223, and this effect was even more
evident when Notch signaling in MSCs was activated by
hypoxia treatment. Additionally, during the immuno￾chemical detection of Notch1 in mouse kidney tissues, it
was found that Notch1 levels in the MSCs of I/R-treated
mice increased in synchrony with upregulation of miR￾223 in the corresponding samples. This finding suggests
activation of a self-protective signaling pathway in I/R￾injured kidneys. Data from apoptosis, BUN, and creatin￾ine clearance studies also suggested a significant role for
miR-223 in the alleviation of kidney I/R injuries by
implanted MSCs. However, a determination of whether
Notch1 activation in kidney tissue represents a feedback
response to miR-223 or occurs due to direct contact
with MSCs in vivo requires further investigation.
Conclusions
Our findings demonstrate that MSCs ameliorated I/R-in￾duced renal failure via a paracrine mechanism. The exo￾somal miR-223 secreted by MSCs was transferred into
RTECs and attenuated damage to renal cells after NLRP
signaling was suppressed. Moreover, the protective effect
of MSCs on kidney tissue was enhanced by hypoxia pre￾treatment, which increased miR-223 levels by activating
Notch1 expression. Our studies with an in vivo mouse
model show that the therapeutic effect of MSCs on I/R￾induced renal injuries was reduced by suppression of the
miR-223/Notch signaling pathway. When taken together,
our data show that MSCs can attenuate renal I/R-in￾duced injuries by transporting miR-223 into kidney cells
and inhibiting NLRP3.
