Abstract
We experienced a case of interstitial lung disease (ILD) that occurred one year after the start of everolimus
therapy for renal cell carcinoma. The pathological features included interstitial pneumonia with granuloma
formation. Everolimus is known to cause ILD; however, its pathology is unclear. Granuloma-forming intersti￾tial pneumonia associated with everolimus is uncommon, although it may be one of the pathological patterns
associated with everolimus-induced ILD. This is a slow-onset case of everolimus-induced ILD in a patient
with renal cell carcinoma. Physicians should thus be aware of the potential for the development of ILD at
any time during the administration of everolimus therapy.

Introduction
Everolimus, an inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamy￾cin (mTOR), is used as an immunosuppressant post￾transplantation or as an anti-cancer drug for renal cell carci￾noma (RCC) and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. Intersti￾tial lung disease (ILD) is one of the major adverse drug re￾actions associated with everolimus therapy, with a frequency
that seems to be much higher than that occurring during
treatment with other anti-cancer drugs (1). The epidemiol￾ogy of everolimus-induced ILD is becoming evident based
on an all-case post-marketing surveillance study conducted
in Japan. The interim analysis of this study showed that ILD
was diagnosed in 105 of 605 treated cases (17.4%) (2).
Many patients have developed ILD; however, only a small
number of patients have undergone bronchoscopy to obtain
a definitive diagnosis of ILD (bronchoalveolar lavage was
performed in eight of 105 cases) (2). As a result, the patho￾logical findings of everolimus-induced ILD have not yet
been fully elucidated.
We herein present a case of ILD that occurred one year
after the start of everolimus therapy in a patient with RCC.
ILD was diagnosed based on clinical, radiographic and
pathological findings. A transbronchial lung biopsy showed
interstitial pneumonia with distinct granuloma formation. In
this report, we also review previous reports describing
pathological findings of the lungs in patients with
everolimus-induced ILD.
Case Report
The patient was a 62-year-old man who had been diag￾nosed with clear cell RCC five years earlier. He had a his￾tory of pulmonary tuberculosis occurring six years before
his presentation with ILD. He had been cured with antitu￾berculous drugs. The RCC had been treated with surgery,
and the patient had subsequently been treated with
interferon-alpha for pulmonary metastasis. Ten months later,
the pulmonary metastasis relapsed. Sorafenib, then sunitinib,

was administered; however, both agents were intolerable due
to side effects of severe anorexia. Therefore, everolimus was
administered as the next treatment regimen. The RCC be￾came stable after treatment with everolimus. One year after
starting everolimus therapy, the patient complained of
coughing, sputum production and dyspnea. Chest radiogra￾phy showed bilateral infiltrative shadows in the middle and
lower lung zones, and computed tomography (CT) revealed
patchy or diffuse ground grass opacities primarily in the
lower lobes of both lungs (Fig. 1).
The laboratory findings of the patient obtained on presen￾tation are shown in Table 1. Increases in the serum levels of
LDH, KL-6 and SP-D were noted. The patient had no fever,
and a sputum culture was negative. A diagnosis of ILD was
suspected, and fiberoptic bronchoscopy was performed to
obtain the diagnosis. The results of the bronchoalveolar lav￾age (BAL) analysis are shown in Table 2. Marked lympho￾cytosis and moderate eosinophilia were observed. A patho￾logical examination of the lung tissue obtained by a trans￾bronchial lung biopsy showed intra-alveolar fibrosis with
lymphocytes and a few eosinophils that had infiltrated into
the alveolar wall. In addition, type II pneumocyte hyperpla￾sia and some binuclear pneumocytes were seen. Intraluminal
non-necrotizing granulomas were prominent (Fig. 2). The
pathological diagnosis was granuloma-forming subacute in￾terstitial pneumonia. The granulomas were distributed pre￾dominantly in the airway, and it was thought that there was
a possibility that the granulomas were caused by a respira￾tory infection such as tuberculosis or a fungal infection.
However, no acid-fast bacilli or fungi were seen in the

granulomas on Ziehl-Neelsen or Alcian blue-PAS staining.
In addition, no microorganisms were cultured, and PCR as￾says for Pneumocystis carinii DNA, Mycobacterium tubercu￾losis DNA and Mycobacterium avium-intracellular DNA
were negative in the BAL fluid analysis. Therefore, the
granulomas were thought to have developed due to a nonin￾fectious cause. Based on these findings, we suspected that
the granuloma-forming interstitial pneumonia may thus have
been caused by everolimus.
The ILD did not improve despite cessation of everolimus;
therefore, administration of prednisolone at a dose of 20
mg/day was initiated. Fig. 3 shows the follow-up data for
the levels of KL-6 and SP-D and the CT results obtained af￾ter treatment of the ILD. The symptoms and infiltrative
shadows resolved immediately, and the dose of prednisolone
was tapered. Although the infiltrative shadows disappeared
on follow-up CT and the serum SP-D level decreased, the
serum KL-6 level did not decrease. Afterwards, growth of
the lung metastasis was observed, and everolimus was re￾started in association with a maintenance dose of predniso￾lone (10 mg/day) to prevent a recurrence of the ILD. The
ILD did not relapse throughout the patient’s clinical course;
however, the serum KL-6 level gradually increased without
elevation of the serum SP-D level. The expression of KL-6
on the surface of the clear cell carcinoma was identified on
immunostaining of the surgically-resected kidney specimen.
Eventually, a metastatic tumor of the liver grew rapidly,
and the patient died four months after the resumption of
everolimus therapy due to tumor progression.
Discussion
The most distinctive feature of everolimus-induced ILD is
its high frequency. ILD occurred in 13.5% of patients re￾ceiving everolimus in a phase III global clinical trial for
RCC (1). In addition, a high incidence of ILD in phase II
and III clinical trials of everolimus for cancers other than
RCC, such as breast cancer, gastric cancer and pancreatic
neuroendocrine tumors, has also been reported, with rates of
2.5-42.4%, 14.8-15.1% and 6.1-17.2%, respectively (3-9).

Based on the data of the interim report of the all-case sur￾veillance for everolimus (AFINITORⓇ) in Japan, it was con￾cluded that most cases of ILD occurred within 84 days from
the start of administration (77.1%; 81 of 105 cases). In con￾trast, the occurrence of ILD more than 169 days from the
start of administration was rare (3.8%; 4 of 105 cases) (2).
The interim report also indicated that the median time to oc￾currence of ILD was 57 days (the minimum and maximum
values were 5 days and 295 days, respectively). The phase
III clinical trial of everolimus for RCC showed that the me￾dian time to occurrence of ILD was 108 days (range: 24 to
257 days) (1).
We experienced a case of ILD that occurred one year af￾ter the start of everolimus therapy. Based on previously re￾ported data regarding everolimus-induced ILD in patients
with RCC, this is a marked slow-onset case. This also sug￾gests that physicians should continue to pay attention to
signs of ILD in patients being treated with everolimus.
The pathological features of this case included interstitial
pneumonia with distinct formation of granulomas. It was
necessary to distinguish between possible infectious and
noninfectious causes of the granulomas because the patient
had a history of pulmonary tuberculosis and had also re￾ceived long-term treatment with everolimus, which exerts
immunosuppressive effects. However, the results of various
bacteriological examinations, including cultures and PCR
analyses, were all negative. We therefore diagnosed the
granulomas as being due to a noninfectious cause. On the
other hand, sarcoidosis and hypersensitivity pneumonitis
caused by inhalation of organic antigens are major causes of
granuloma-forming interstitial pneumonia and should there￾fore be considered in the differential diagnosis. Although
granulomas are usually distributed in the interstitium of
bronchovascular bundles and interstitial fibrosis is obscure
in patients with sarcoidosis, in this case, intra-alveolar poly￾poid fibrosis was prominent and the granulomas were dis￾tributed in the intra-alveolar spaces. In addition, BAL cell
differentiation revealed lymphocytosis and eosinophilia;
however, eosinophilia is not usually seen in either sarcoido￾sis or hypersensitivity pneumonitis (10). Therefore, it is un￾likely that granuloma-forming interstitial pneumonia would
be diagnosed as either sarcoidosis or hypersensitivity pneu￾monitis. Based on an exclusive diagnosis, this case was di￾agnosed as drug-induced pneumonitis, and the most likely
causative drug was thought to be everolimus.
Although the incidence of everolimus-induced ILD is
high, the number of reports that have described the pathol￾ogy of everolimus-induced ILD is small. Among the previ￾ous studies of everolimus-induced ILD written in English,
we could find only nine articles that described the patho￾logical findings of ILD (1, 11-18). Table 3 presents descrip￾tions of the pathological findings of everolimus-induced ILD
in these nine articles, which included 13 cases. Various
pathological patterns have been reported; however, the main
features are thought to be lymphocytic interstitial inflamma￾tion and organizing pneumonia. One report briefly described
a case of everolimus-induced organizing pneumonia with
rare, poorly-formed granulomas (1). The case presented here
also involved granuloma formation; however, the granulo￾mas were not poorly-formed, but rather well-formed, granu￾lomas.
Drug-induced granuloma formation in the lungs is rela￾tively rare, although various drugs are known to cause
granulomas, including acebutolol, etanercept, fluoxetine hy￾drochloride, methotrexate, nitrofurantoin, procarbazine and
sirolimus (19). Everolimus is one of the sirolimus deriva-

267
tives, and hence, the pathological pattern of everolimus￾induced ILD may resemble that of sirolimus-induced ILD.
The serum level of KL-6 is an established biomarker of
interstitial pneumonia, including drug-induced interstitial
pneumonia (20, 21). The present patient presented with an
elevation of the serum KL-6 level at symptom onset, which
was useful for making the diagnosis of ILD. However, the
serum KL-6 level did not decrease even though the radio￾graphic findings improved after treatment with a steroid, and
there was also a discrepancy between the trends in the se￾rum KL-6 and SP-D levels (Fig. 3). Several hypotheses can
be considered regarding this problem. For example, the ex￾pression of KL-6 in regenerated type II pneumocytes might
have been sustained due to alveolar damage caused by the
resumption of everolimus therapy or KL-6 might have been
produced by tumor cells and leaked into the bloodstream
during tumor progression. The latter speculation is based on
the observation that the serum KL-6 level increased in paral￾lel with tumor growth and the fact that the expression of
KL-6 on the surface of the tumor cells was identified on im￾munostaining of the surgically-resected kidney specimen.
However, there is no supportive evidence showing that the
serum KL-6 levels increase in patients with RCC. Further
study is therefore needed to verify this speculation.
In conclusion, everolimus-induced ILD can present with
various pathological patterns, including the formation of
granulomas, and can occur any time, even more than a year
after the start of everolimus therapy. Therefore, physicians
should consistently pay attention to the possibility of ILD
during the treatment of patients with everolimus.
