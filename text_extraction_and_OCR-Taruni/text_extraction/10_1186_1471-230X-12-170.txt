Abstract
Background: Hepatocellular cancer is notorious for recurrence even after curative therapy. High recurrence
determines the long term prognosis of the patients. Vitamin K2 has been tested in trials for its effect on prevention
of recurrence and improving survival. The results are inconclusive from individual trials and in our knowledge no
systematic review which entirely focuses on Vitamin K2 as a chemo preventive agent is available to date. This
review is an attempt to pool all the existing trials together and update the existing knowledge on the topic.
Methods: Medline, Embase and Cochrane Register of Controlled trials were searched for randomized controlled
trials where vitamin K2 or its analogues, in any dosage were compared to placebo or No vitamin K2, for participants
of any age or sex. Reference lists and abstracts of conference proceedings were searched by hand. Additional
papers were identified by a manual search of the references from the key articles. Attempt was made to contact
the authors of primary studies for missing data and with the experts in the field.
Trials were assessed for inclusion by two independent reviewers. Primary outcomes were recurrence rates and
survival rates. There were no secondary outcomes. Data was synthesized using a random effects model and results
presented as relative risk with 95% Confidence Intervals.
Result: For recurrence of hepatocellular cancer after hepatic resection or local ablative therapy, compared
with controls, participants receiving Vitamin K2, pooled relative risks for hepatocellular cancer were 0.60;
95% CI: 0.28–1.28, p = 0.64) at 1 yr 0.66; 95% CI: 0.47–0.91), p = 0.01) at 2 yr; 0.71; 95% CI: 0.58–0.85, p = 0.004)
at 3 yr respectively. The results were combined using the random analysis model.
Conclusion: Five RCTs evaluated the preventive efficacy of menatetrenone on HCC recurrence after hepatic
resection or local ablative therapy. The meta-analysis of all five studies, failed to confirm significantly better tumor
recurrence- free survival at 1 year. Improved tumor recurrence at 2nd and 3rd year may be just due to insufficient
data. There was no beneficial effect on the overall survival. However, to confirm the beneficial effect or lack of it,
large, higher quality randomized controlled trials are still required.

Background
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a significant global
cause of morbidity and mortality. Overall, it is the
third leading cause of the cancer death across the
globe with numbers reaching 600,000 per year [1].
Long term prognosis remains poor even after the po￾tentially curative treatments such as curative resection
and radiofrequency ablation. Despite advancements in
the curative treatments, the 5 year survival rate is
only 50–70% [2]. Liver cirrhosis is considered as the
most significant risk factor accounting for as much
as 90% cases [3]. HCC is a rising global health prob￾lem, with incidence increasing in Asia, Europe and
United States [2,4]. Although high recurrence of HCC
is the major challenge but variable degree of benefit
has been observed by use of chemotherapeutic agents
such as interferon [5,6]. However, adverse effects such
as bone marrow suppression after long term admi￾nistration as well as the fact that beneficial effect
is limited to virological responders limits its useful￾ness [7,8]. Currently, there is no single approved
agent to prevent recurrence of HCC after the cura￾tive treatment.
HCC, just like other cancers require angiogenesis
make it a target for anti angiogenic therapy [9]. This ap￾proach has proven successful at least in some animal
models. The suppression of angiogenic pathways signal￾ing pathways in murine models retards the HCC growth
[10]. Drugs such as Sorafenib have not been able to es￾tablish themselves because of the costs and severe ad￾verse effects profile [11,12]. Use of Vitamin K2 as an
anti angiogenic factor is a potential therapy to prevent
recurrence of HCC. Vitamin K2 is a fat soluble vitamin
that is required as a co enzyme for the carboxylase
involved in the posttranscriptional modification of clot￾ting factors [13]. Abnormal uncarboxylated prothrombin
(des-gamma-carboxy-prothrombin[DCP]) is found to be
elevated in some patients of HCC with the aggressive
phenotype. Vitamin K has been show to suppress plasma
DCP concentrations. Vitamin K2 has been employed in
several studies to delay and/or prevent the recurrence of
HCC. It acts by suppressing the CyclinD1 expression
through inhibition of NF Kappa B, thereby inhibiting the
growth of HCC cells [14].
Several clinical trials have attempted to elucidate the
role of Vitamin K2 in preventing the recurrence of
HCC. The results are conflicting, some suggesting bene￾fit while others failing to do so [1,3,15]. The individual
trials are small and therefore underpowered. The aim of
this systematic review is to identify the randomized clinical
trials comparing vitamin K2 versus placebo (or no Vitamin
K2) assessing the effect of Vitamin K2 on the recurrence
of hepatocellular cancer once the curative treatment has
been undertaken.
Methods
Study selection
We searched PubMed (MEDLINE), EMBASE and
Cochrane database of Controlled Trials from the 1990
to December 2011. Following terms as Medical Subject
Headings and keywords were used; Vitamin K, Hepato￾cellular Cancer, Hepatectomy, Chemoprevention and Re￾currence. Search Strategy is outlined as a flow sheet in
Figure 1. Initially, No language restrictions were applied.
Searches were limited to randomized clinical trials in
human participants of any age or gender. A manual
examination of references in selected articles was also
performed. We also looked the websites pertaining to
the clinical trials public registries (ClinicalTrials.gov and
ClinicalStudyResults.org). The United State Food and
drug Administration Website was searched for submis￾sions pertaining to our concerned topic. We tried to
contact the experts in the fieldbut the success was very
limited. Eventually, articles in only English language
were considered because of limited resources. The titles
and abstracts of 5 potentially relevant references were
identified through the literature search and reviewed in￾dependently by 2 investigators (R.I.B., R.H) to determine
whether they met eligibility criteria for inclusion. Dis￾crepancies regarding whether to include or exclude a
study were resolved by discussion. Randomized clinical
trials were included irrespective of publication status.
Studies were eligible for inclusion if they were rando￾mized controlled trials of Vitamin K2 treatment among
persons who were considered cured after curative ther￾apy. Studies were excluded if they were observational
studies or recurrence events were not reported as an
outcome at 12 months or if the participants were not
disease free after the primary treatment of hepatocellular
cancer. Search strategies for Medline and Cochrane
database of controlled trials are attached as Appendix 1.
Data abstraction
All data were independently abstracted by 2 investigators
(R.I.B, R.H) using a standardized data collection form.
Discrepancies were resolved through discussion among
the investigators (R.I.B,R.H) and through reference to
the original articles. We attempted to contact study
authors for missing information when necessary, but the
success was limited. Trial characteristics abstracted
included design of the randomized controlled trial, type
and number of control, number of treatment groups, de￾scription of treatment regimens (45 mg vs 90 mg), de￾scription of inclusion and exclusion criteria, and
demographic characteristics of study populations at
baseline. Some of the information is presented (Table 1).
The outcomes recorded included the recurrence of
hepatocellular cancer and the survival at 1,2 and 3 years
post resection (Table 2). Data was either directly
Riaz et al. BMC Gastroenterology 2012, 12:170 Page 2 of 9
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-230X/12/170

obtained from the trials or was calculated from the in￾formation available. Only Important information is pre￾sented in Table 2. Data was pooled for recurrence and
survival at 1, 2 and 3 years by random effects Model.
Quality assessment
Two authors (R.I.B., R.H.) independently evaluated qual￾ity of each study using an established tool [16]. Nine
domains were assessed: randomization, concealment of
treatment allocation, similarity of groups at baseline, eli￾gibility criteria, blinding of outcome assessor, patient
and care provider, avoidance of co interventions and
intention-to-treat analysis (Table 3). Disagreement was
resolved through consensus and discussion. All studies
reporting the recurrence as an outcome consistently
were included in the final analysis.
Statistical analysis
Results are reported as Relative Risks with 95% confi￾dence intervals calculated. Heterogeneity is assessed by
the inspection of the forest plot, and using X2 tests with
n-1 degree of freedom where n=number of studies
involved. A P value of 0.10 is defined as significant. The
I
2 statistic is also inspected with values greater than 50%
consistent with significant heterogeneity.
It was expected a priori difference in outcome may be
contributed by many factors including the cause of
hepatocellular cancer, dosage of Vitamin K2 used,
method used for the curative resection and age and sex
of the patient. However no subgroup analysis was per￾formed because of the small size and number of studies.
Moreover, no formal assessment of publication bias by
funnel plot was done because of small number of
included studies. However we conducted sensitivity ana￾lysis for recurrence at 1 year by excluding the study by
Yojishi and colleagues as it tested the effect of combin￾ation therapy and also by excluding the study by Yoshida
and colleagues which is by far the largest trial.
Results
Of the 5 potentially relevant studies identified in the
initial literature search, 4 were included in the meta￾analysis. Another study was identified by the manual
search of the references of the key articles,making it a
total of 5 studies (Figure 1). The baseline characteris￾tics of participants such as the frequency of viral

hepatitis B and C, alcohol intake, tumor size, number
of tumors, child pugh classification differed among the
participants of the studies. Table 1 describes the base￾line characteristics of participants included in the
study. Table 2 summaries the results for the both the
primary outcomes of the study. Table 3 describes the
quality assessment characteristics of trials included in
the meta-analysis.
The dose of Vitamin K2 administered varied between
studies, either 45 mg/d or 90 mg/d. Follow up in all
studies included was done at 12 ,24 and 36 months ex￾cept the study done by Yoshida and colleagues [1]. Entry
criteria also varied between studies; however, all studies
required the patients to be cured after the primary treat￾ment of hepatocellular cancer.
The 5 studies included in the meta-analysis incorpo￾rated data from 754 participants who were free of hepa￾tocelluar cancer after the primary treatment. The cause
of hepatocelluar cancer varied between studies (Table 1).
Pooled overall RRs are presented for recurrence and sur￾vival of hepatocellular cancer Figures 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.
Three earlier studies showed significantly better tumor
recurrence-free survival, while all the studies failed to
show any significant effect on overall survival. However,
the largest and most recent trial by Yoshida and collea￾gues enrolling 548 patients (or 72.7% patients of this
meta-analysis) failed to confirm the beneficial effect on
tumour recurrence-free survival.
One of the first randomized controlled trials on the
topic was a pilot study done by Mizuta and colleagues
[15]. Study included 61 patients and suggested the bene￾ficial effect of Vitamin K2 both on the recurrence as well
as survival. The cumulative recurrence rates in the treat￾ment group were 12.5% at 1 year, 39.0% at 2 years, and
64.3% at 3 years; the corresponding recurrence rates in
the control group were 55.2%, 83.2%, and 91.6%, re￾spectively. The results were statistically significant. The

1-year, 2-year and 3-year cumulative overall survival
rates for the treatment group were 100%, 96.6% and
87%, respectively, while the 1-year, 2-year, and 3-year cu￾mulative survival rates for the control group were 96.4%,
80.9% and 64%, respectively. These results were not sta￾tistically significant. In another study conducted by
Hotta and colleagues [17] the cumulative incidence of
HCC recurrence did not differ between the two groups,
33% and 50% in the treatment and control respectively,
and the cumulative overall survival rate tended to be
higher in the treatment group. However, this result was
not statistically significant. Kakizaki and colleagues in a
study showed that vitamin K2 had a suppressive effect
on the recurrence of HCC, but there was no significant
difference in the overall survival rates [3]. The cumula￾tive recurrence-free rates in the vitamin K2 group were
92.3% at 1 year, 48.6% at 2 years and 38.8% at 3 years;
those in the control group were 71.7%, 35.9% and 9.9%,
respectively. The difference was significant. The cumula￾tive overall survival rates in the vitamin K2 group were
100% at 1 year, 95.0% at 2 years and 77.5% at 3 years,
and the corresponding rates in the control group were
95.8%, 90.2% and 66.4%, respectively. There was no sig￾nificant difference between the two groups. In the trial
conducted by Yojishi and colleagues, a combination
treatment with a vitamin K2 analogue (menatetrenone,
45 mg/day) and an angiotensin converting enzyme in￾hibitor (ACE-I) (perindopril, 4 mg/day) for 36–48 months
after curative therapy for HCC markedly inhibited the
cumulative recurrence of HCC, as well as suppressed
of the serum levels of the vascular endothelial growth
factor [4]. The serum levels of lectin-reactive alpha￾fetoprotein were also suppressed in addition and
almost in parallel with vascular endothelial growth
factor.
In a Recent Trial conducted by Yoshida and colleagues
[1] a total of 548 patients were enrolled at 31 study sites
in Japan and randomly assigned between March 2004
and September 2005. HCC recurrence (i.e., intrahepatic
lesions adjacent to or distant from previously treated
nodules, and extrahepatic metastasis), cancer other than
HCC, or death from any cause were detected in 58, 52,
and 76 patients in the placebo,45-mg/day, and 90-mg/
day groups respectively. This trial also assessed the
safety of Vitamin K2 administration as well as the dose
response relationship. While conducting the Meta ana￾lysis both 45 mg/day as well as 90 mg day arm were
combined into a single treatment group.

We conducted both fixed and random effect meta￾analysis on these five studies to assess the effects of vita￾min K2 on tumour recurrence rates and patient survival.
Figures 2, 3 and 4 show the pooled RR of 1-year, 2-year
and 3-year tumour recurrence after curative therapy in
the vitamin K2 treatment patients versus no treatment
patients.
Only results from random effects Model are reported
because of significant heterogeneity.
Because of the lack of data on 3-year recurrence in the
study by Hotta and colleagues and lack of data on 2nd
and 3rd year recurrence in the study by Yoshida and col￾leagues the meta analysis for 2 and 3 year recurrence
included 4 and 3 studies respectively.
Our meta-analysis by random effects model effect
model showed that vitamin K2 did not significantly
decreased HCC recurrence rates at 1 year, however it
did appear to significantly decreased HCC recurrence
rates 2 and 3 years after potentially curative therapy:
1-year tumor recurrence (RR: 0.60; 95% CI: 0.28–1.28,
p = 0.64); 2-year tumor recurrence (RR: 0.66; 95% CI:
0.47–0.91), p = 0.01); 3- year tumor recurrence (RR:
0.71; 95% CI: 0.58–0.85, p =0.004). I2 values were
calculated to quantify heterogeneity between studies
The I values were 74% (P = .004) and 26% (P = .25)
and 0% P = .51) for recurrence at 1,2and 3 years re￾spectively, indicating significant heterogeneity between
studies Included for analysis at 1 year and no het￾erogeneity between studies used for recurrence at
3 years. Vitamin K2 did significantly decreased HCC
recurrence rates at 1 year if study by Yoshida and
colleagues was excluded (RR: 0.46; 95% CI: 0.22–
0.94), p = 0.03). The I values also came down form
were 74% (P = .004) to 41% (P = .016) hence the ex￾clusion explaining some heterogeneity. However, the
effect of Vitamin K2 failed to become significant
1 year if the study by Yojishi and colleagues were
excluded ruling out any possible influence of com￾bination therapy (Vitamin K2 and ACE inhibitor) on
the overall result.
Figures 5, 6 and 7 show Forest plots of vitamin K2
on the 1, 2- and 3-year survivals following curative
therapy using the random effect model. As indicated,
vitamin K2 did not significantly increase overall sur￾vival at either 1 (RR: 1.02; 95% CI: 1.00–1.04, p = 0.09),
2-year(RR: 1.09; 95% CI: 0.96–1.25, p = 0.19) or 3-year
(RR: 1.13; 95% CI: 0.95–1.35, p = 0.17) survival. I2 were
calculated as 0% (P = .65), 59% (P = .06), 21% (P = .28)
indication significant, no and mild heterogeneity
respectively.

Discussion
This meta-analysis is unique in that, to our knowledge,
it is the first to focus entirely on the role of vitamin K2
in the prevention of hepatocellular carcinoma after the
curative therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma. Previously
Chu and colleagues investigated the role of Vitamin ana￾logues in chemoprevention of hepatocellular carcinoma
in a meta-analysis [18]. The study suggested that there is
evidence to suggest that chemo-preventive therapy after
partial hepatectomy and local ablative therapy in the
form of vitamin analogues is beneficial in prolonging the
disease free survival, but evidence is less for an effect of
overall survival. The meta analysis was based on a 4
studies with a very small number of patients. Our meta
analysis includes a recently published RCT by Yoshida
and Colleagues [1] which is a relatively large trial includ￾ing 548 patients (or 72.7% patients of this meta-analysis).
It has been suggested in the past that Vitamin K2 may
be useful in preventing both the early and late type of
recurrences [15] possibly by inhibiting the proliferation
of HCC cells through cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase or
via suppression of cyclin D1 expression through the
IKK/IkappaB/nuclear factor-kappaB pathway [19,20].
However, the present meta analysis fails to confirm the
benefit of Vitamin K2 in reducing the recurrence and
increasing the disease free survival after the curative
treatment of HCC. All trials were conducted in japan
and only one trial was multi -centered. The quality of
trials was variable (Table 3). It was difficult to deter￾mine precisely the quality of included trials as many
omitted important methodological details.
There are several limitations inour study. It is meta
analysis of a small number of trials. The recurrence and
survival data in the largest trial by Yoshida et al. [1] was
available for only 1 year and not 2 and 3 year time.
Hence the results are limited for the recurrence and sur￾vival at 2nd and 3rd years. Moreover in the original trial
the treatment groups were divided into two groups
45 mg/day and 90 mg/day but for the purpose of our
analysis we considered both groups as a single treatment
group. However due to s small sample size we could not
separately assess the effect of different doses of Vitamin
K2. Moreover, for several outcomes the heterogeneity
was significant e.g. for recurrence at 1 year I2 = 74 indi￾cating significant heterogeneity making the results less
reliable. One of the included studies done by Yoshiji and
colleagues tested a combination of Vitamin K2 and ACE
inhibitor. We also pooled the results without the former
but the still the results for recurrence at I year were
unchanged.
In future there is a necessity to conduct larger trials to
confirm or decline the benefits of Vitamin K2 agonists

in reference to hepatocellular carcinoma. With larger pa￾tient numbers it may be possible to perform the sub￾group analysis to evaluate for heterogeneity of of studies.
We also suggest the authors of future trials to follow
consort statement for better methodological assessment
of trials. It may be beneficial if the trials are also con￾ducted in other parts of the world as so far all the exist￾ing knowledge on the topic comes from Japan.
Conclusions
This meta-analysis of five randomized controlled trials,
failed to confirm significantly better tumor recurrence￾free survival at 1 year. Improved tumor recurrence at
2nd and 3rd year may be just due to insufficient data in
terms of small sample sizes of the included articles.
There was no beneficial effect on the overall survival.
We therefore conclude that there is insufficient evidence
at present to recommend administration of vitamin K2
for preventing the recurrence of hepatocellular carcin￾oma after curative resection. However, to confirm the
beneficial effect or lack of it, large, higher quality rando￾mized controlled trials are still required.
