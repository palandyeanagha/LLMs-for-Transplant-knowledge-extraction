Abstract
Background: Morbid obesity remains a potential relative contra￾indication for cardiac transplantation. Hence, a select population 
of morbidly obese patients with end-stage heart failure may require 
a ventricular assist device (VAD) as a bridge to transplantation to 
afford them time to lose sufficient weight and thus decrease there 
mortality rate after transplantation. Unfortunately, obtaining suit￾able weight loss via dietary or exercise regimens is limited by the 
cardiac limitations of the patients. We report on a new procedure 
of combining ventricular assist device placement with adjustable 
gastric band (VAD-BAND) placement to facilitate sufficient weight 
loss for cardiac transplantation.
Methods: We report on our experience of 2 morbidly obese (BMI 
46.6, BMI 43.7) patients with severe non-ischemic cardiomyopathy 
who underwent a VAD-BAND placement for treatment of morbid 
obesity and potential future cardiac transplantation.
Results: Patient 1 was a 24-year-old male with a body mass index 
(BMI) of 46.6 admitted in cardiogenic shock with severe non-isch￾emic cardiomyopathy (New York Functional Class IV, Left Ven￾tricular Ejection Fraction 15.3%) who underwent the VAD-BAND 
procedure. At 11 months outpatient follow-up the patient had clini￾cally improved with a BMI of 34.2. Patient 2 was a 36-year-old 
male with a body mass index of 43.7 admitted in cardiogenic shock 
with severe non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (New York Functional 
Class IV, Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction 17.1%) who underwent 
placement of a VAD-BAND. At 4 months post-operation, the pa￾tient was stalwart clinically with a BMI of 34.8. Both patients are 
now under consideration for cardiac transplantation.
Conclusions: In conclusion, concurrent placement of a VAD￾BAND is a safe and viable option for morbidly obese patients with 
end-stage heart disease. Further research is needed to define indica￾tions and future clinical practice.

Introduction
According to the World Health Organization, there are over 
500 million obese individuals worldwide classified as obese 
(BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2
) [1], with a significant proportion of these 
individuals classified as morbidly obese (BMI ≥ 40 mg/
kg2
). Americans have been reported to have highest BMI of 
developed countries with approximately 70% of the adult 
population classified as either overweight or obese [2, 3]. In 
Canada, approximately 60% of the adult population is clas￾sified as either overweight or obese [4]. In addition, the obe￾sity epidemic continues to increase and is associated with 
development of obesity-related comorbidities. Concurrent￾ly, in the US, heart failure affects over 5.5 million patients 
[5]. Recently, Kenchaiah et al reported an 11% increase in 
heart failure risk among men with elevated BMI compared 
to those with normal BMI [6]. In addition, morbid obesity is 
a relative contraindication to heart transplant. Grady et al re￾ported an increased mortality rate following heart transplan￾tation in patients > 140% of ideal body weight [7]. Hence, 
many morbidly obese transplant patients require ventricular

assist devices to bridge them until they have lost sufficient 
weight to be considered for cardiac transplantation. Unfor￾tunately, obtaining suitable weight loss via dietary or ex￾ercise regimens is limited by the functional limitations of 
patients with end-stage heart failure and has been shown 
to be of limited success. We report on a new procedure of 
combining ventricular assist device placement with adjust￾able gastric band (VAD-BAND) placement to facilitate suf￾ficient weight loss for possible future consideration of car￾diac transplantation.
Methods
We report on our experience of two morbidly obese (BMI 
46.6, BMI 43.7) patients with severe non-ischemic cardiomy￾opathy who underwent a combined placement of Ventricular 
Assist Device and Adjustable Gastric Band (VAD-BAND) 
for treatment of morbid obesity, and potential consideration 
for future cardiac transplantation. An open adjustable gastric 
band was placed through an abdominal incision, followed by 
placement of the ventricular assist device.
Results
Both patients underwent open placement of the adjustable 
gastric band prior to placement of the VAD (Table 1). Patient 
1 was a 24 year old male with a body mass index (BMI) of 
46.6 kg/m2
 admitted in cardiogenic shock with severe non￾ischemic cardiomyopathy (New York Functional Class IV, 
Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction 15.3%) to the intensive 
care unit. The patient concurrently underwent the VAD￾BAND procedure with no peri-operative complications. At 
11 months outpatient follow-up the patient had clinically im￾proved with a BMI of 34.2 kg/m2
. Patient 2 was a 36 year 
old male with a body mass index of 43.7 kg/m2
 admitted in 
cardiogenic shock with severe non-ischemic cardiomyopa￾thy (New York Functional Class IV, Left Ventricular Ejection 
Fraction 17.1%) to the intensive care unit. Patient 2 under￾went placement of a VAD-BAND and at 4 months post-oper￾ation, the patient was stalwart clinically with a BMI of 34.8 
kg/m2
. Additional operative for BAND placement was 36 
and 29 minutes and did not affect short-term post-operative 
outcomes. Intermediate follow-up demonstrates a success￾ful weight reduction and improvement in cardiac parameters 
(Left Ventricle Index Dimension-LVID). Both patients are 
now under consideration for cardiac transplantation.
Discussion
This study reports the first two cases of successful VAD￾BAND placement in morbidly obese patients with end-stage

heart failure. Considering that the VAD generator is placed 
into the abdominal cavity, placement of the adjustable gas￾tric band may be preformed efficiently and safely in this pa￾tient population.
The demographic of the North American patient con￾tinues to change, with an overall trend toward increased 
BMI [2]. Morbidly obese patients with severe, refractory 
end-stage heart disease have limited treatment options. 
These include maximal medical therapy, insertion of VADs 
as a bridge to cardiac transplantation or cardiac transplan￾tation itself [8]. According to Dhesi et al, insertion of VAD 
alone produced significant moderate weight loss, resulting 
improved BMI at 6 months post-insertion (36.1 kg/m2 to 
31.8 kg/m2) [9]. However, these authors observed no sig￾nificant change with maximal medical management alone. 
Though these findings are positive, there is a paucity of 
evidence in morbidly obese patients with end-stage heart 
disease. Cardiac transplantation is typically contraindicat￾ed in these patients secondary to limited organ availability 
and increased mortality and morbidity rates [7]. Contrast￾ingly, insertion of VAD has been shown to be successful in 
obese patients without increased mortality comparatively 
[10]. Therefore, to decrease the mortality risk in morbidly 
obese patients, the addition of an adjustable gastric band 
was considered. As a primarily restrictive procedure, that 
is reversible, and does not alter gastrointestinal continu￾ity, it has been shown to produce marked weight loss in 
morbidly obese patients without heart failure [11]. The 
successful placement of the VAD-BAND in these patients 
suggest that the VAD-BAND may be reasonable option in 
morbidly obese patients, that otherwise may not be candi￾dates for transplantation. 
There are several limitations must be considered. First￾ly, we have only two patients in our series. Larger patient 
numbers in the form of a clinical trial may be a safe ap￾proach to a new therapeutic concept. Secondly, the follow￾up of our two patients is relatively short. However, the 
marked weight loss seen in both patients, suggests that the 
VAD-BAND may represents a promising advancement in 
both managing this patient population and fostering the po￾tential for future cardiac transplantation for an otherwise 
terminal condition. 
Conclusion
In conclusion, concurrent placement of a VAD-BAND may 
be a safe and viable option for morbidly obese patients with 
end-stage heart disease. Further research is needed to define 
indications and future clinical practice.
