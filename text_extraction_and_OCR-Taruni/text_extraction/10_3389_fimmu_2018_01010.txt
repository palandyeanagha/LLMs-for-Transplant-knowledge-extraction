Microvascular injury during acute rejection has been associated with massive infiltration 
of CD4+ T effector cells, and the formation of complement products (C3a and C5a). 
Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are potent immunosuppressors of the adaptive immune sys￾tem and have proven sufficient to rescue microvascular impairments. Targeting C5a 
has been linked with improved microvascular recovery, but its effects on the Treg and 
T effector balance is less well known. Here, we demonstrate the impact of C5a blockade 
on Treg induction and microvascular restoration in rejecting mouse airway allografts. 
BALB/c → C57BL/6 allografts were treated with a C5a-neutralizing l-aptamer
(10 mg/kg, i.p. at d0 and every second day thereafter), and allografts were serially 
monitored for Treg infiltration, tissue oxygenation (tpO2), microvascular blood flow, and 
functional microvasculature between donor and recipients during allograft rejection. 
We demonstrated that C5a blocking significantly leads to enhanced presence of Tregs 
in the allograft, reinstates donor–recipient functional microvasculature, improves tpO2, 
microvascular blood flow, and epithelial repair, followed by an upregulation of IL-5, 
TGF-β, IL-10 vascular endothelial growth factor, and ANGPT1 gene expression, while 
it maintained a healthy epithelium and prevented subepithelial collagen deposition at 
d28 posttransplantation. Together, these data indicate that inhibition of C5a signaling 
has potential to preserve microvasculature and rescue allograft from a sustained 
hypoxic/ischemic phase, limits airway tissue remodeling through the induction of 
Treg-mediated immune tolerance. These findings may be useful in designing anti-C5a 
therapy in combination with existing immunosuppressive regimens to rescue tissue/
organ rejection.

INTRODUCTION
Promoting microvascular integrity supports transplant health 
and may avoid the onset of chronic rejection (CR) of transplanted 
lungs. Allograft microvascular injuries have been associated 
with massive infiltration of CD4+ T effector cells and antibody￾mediated complement activation, which promotes obliteration 
of microvasculature, airway remodeling, and ultimately CR of 
transplanted lungs (1–5). During the early phase of inflammation, 
complement pathways release active complement fragments, 
C3a, C4a, and C5a. These are potent anaphylatoxins that alter 
vascular permeability and airway remodeling (6–9). In normal 
circumstances, the C3 split product C3b plays a central role in 
generating C5 convertase to cleave C5 into the active components 
C5a and C5b. Compared to the other C3 split product, C3a, C5a 
is the more potent chemotactic agent, and is recognized by C5aR 
on a variety of lymphocytes including regulatory T cells (Tregs) 
during inflammation, and further binding of C5a during the 
inflammatory phase results in shifting of the T cell response to a 
Th1-type, promoting effector T cell activation (10) and limiting 
natural regulatory T  cell (nTreg) regulatory activities (11). Of 
note, C5a, being the most potent anaphylatoxin, is considered 
the biologically most lethal fragment released during comple￾ment activation, and is therefore, regarded as a key target for 
complement modulation (12, 13). Although C5 cleavage gener￾ates C5a as well as C5b which forms together with C6, C7, C8 
and C9 the lytic terminal Membrane Attack Complex, the clinical 
outcomes of C5 deficiency do not differ markedly from those of 
other terminal component deficiencies (e.g., C6, C7, C8, and C9) 
suggesting that the absence of C5a does not contribute signifi￾cantly to the clinical aftermath in C5-deficient patients. Therefore, 
the selective blockade of C5a promises to be the optimal leverage, 
so that the normal up- and downstream disease-preventing func￾tions of complement remain intact, and only the harmful activated 
fragment, the pro-inflammatory anaphylatoxin, is blocked.
CD4+CD25+FOXP3+ Tregs were first reported to be crucial for 
the maintenance of self-tolerance, for immune homeostasis and 
for protection from autoimmune diseases (14). Forkhead box P3 
(FOXP3) is an intracellular marker, which is specifically expressed 
in regulatory CD4+CD25+ in the course of differentiation from 
naïve CD4+ T  cells. Tregs play a central role in establishing 
immunological tolerance and suppress autoimmunity (15,  16). 
A number of preclinical and clinical studies highlighted the 
therapeutic potential of these cells in organ transplantation, but 
pathological or beneficial effects of Tregs on rejecting allografts 
are still not very clear (15, 17–23).
Regulatory T  cells modulate immune balance and self￾tolerance through the generation of thymus-derived Tregs and 
peripheral Treg infiltration, and in the last couple of years, the 
immunosuppressive property of Treg has been utilized to rescue 
transplants during rejection (24). CD4+FOXP3+ peripheral Tregs 
play a fundamental role in maintaining immunotolerance against 
mucosal injury and pathogenic alloimmunity. In addition, they 
facilitate tolerance induction in murine models of solid organ 
transplantation (3–6). In contrast to thymus-derived Tregs, 
peripheral Tregs are liable to inflammation-induced reversal into 
effector T cells (8), thereby limiting their therapeutic potential 
in autoimmune diseases. Thymus-derived Tregs are critical 
regulators of self-tolerance (25) and protect against pathogenic 
alloimmunity (26), and have been shown to facilitate tolerance 
induction in murine models of solid organ (24, 27) and hemat￾opoietic cell transplantation (28). In general, Tregs are known to 
be crucial in the maintenance of peripheral immune tolerance, 
and are the key modulators of the immune reaction during allo￾graft maintenance in a number of transplant models including 
kidney, cardiac, and post-ischemic neovascularization in hind 
limb ischemia (29–36).
Previously, we reported that Treg-mediated immunotherapy 
has potential to preserve the microvasculature of transplanted 
tracheae and thereby to rescue the allografts from a sustained 
hypoxic/ischemic phase, which limits airway tissue remodeling 
(23, 37). Our findings demonstrated that Treg reconstitution 
favored reestablishment of donor–recipient microvasculature 
as compared to rejecting allografts on all time points studied. 
Furthermore, this study highlighted an interesting inverse cor￾relation between the duration of microvascular loss (hypoxia/
ischemia) and the presence of Tregs in blood and tissue during 
rejection episodes, which critically affected inflammation￾induced epithelial loss, and subepithelial fibrosis.
It has been shown previously that C3a and C5a both activate 
T cells and antigen-presenting cells (APC), and that signaling of 
C3aR/C5aR on T cells and APCs influences T cell differentiation, 
expansion and survival of CD4+ T helper cells, which suggests 
that complement deficiency or blockade can potentially attenuate 
T cell-mediated autoimmunity (T regulatory and T effector cell 
balance) and thus delay allograft rejection (38). Thus, blocking 
and deficiency of both C5a and C5aR have been associated with 
improved allograft survival (39, 40). In addition, expression of 
and signaling through both C3aR and C5aR on nTregs has been 
reported to inhibit Treg function (3, 41), while pharmacological 
blockade of C5a has been associated with increased frequency of 
Tregs in a mouse GvHD model and with increased microvascu￾lar and epithelial repair in murine airway allografts (7, 24, 42). 
These findings prompted us to investigate a possible relationship 
between the complement cascade and T regulatory cells, which 
when combined may further amplify the regulatory mechanism 
of tissue recipients. The current study pursued to uncover the 
novel therapeutic benefits of AON-D21, an l-aptamer binding 
to C5a and to the C5a moiety on C5 prior to cleavage into C5a 
and C5b. AON-D21 therapy led to Treg induction, improve￾ment in microvascular blood flow, and associated tissue repair 
in an experimental mouse model of orthotopic airway allograft 
(43), which resembles the airway fibrosis seen in clinical lung 
transplantation (1, 44). Therefore, the key objective was to 
demonstrate if therapeutic administration of the C5a inhibitor 
AON-D21 may facilitate microvascular blood flow of allografts 
through Treg induction and thus promote tissue oxygenation 
(tpO2), and limit fibrosis during rejection. This novel therapeutic 
strategy of targeting the C5a C5aR-axis during acute rejection 
episodes may be an effective therapeutic strategy in combina￾tion with other immunosuppressive regimens for preventing the 
development of CR.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Mice
All mice utilized in this study were originally purchased from 
the Jackson laboratory (JAX, USA), and later maintained as an 
original colony in our animal research facility at King Faisal 
specialist Hospital and Research Center (KFSH&RC), Riyadh, 
Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
C57BL/6
C57BL/6 (B6.H-2b
) mice were utilized as recipients of all grafts 
and as tracheal donors in syngrafts as described below (Table 1).
BALB/c
BALB/c (H-2d
) mice were routinely used as allogeneic tracheal donors 
for the B6 strain in the experimental allogeneic orthotopic trachea 
transplants. Based on our previously published findings (7, 45, 46), 
we selected days 4, 8, 9, 10–14, 20, and 28 for studying microvas￾cular flow and tissue hypoxia in experimental groups (Table 1).
Orthotopic Tracheal Transplant 
(OTT) Model
The mouse model of OTT is a well-established experimental 
model of alloimmune airway transplant rejection (7, 24, 43, 
45,  46). Currently, there are no models which consistently 
produce and replicate fibrotic remodeling as seen in transplant 
recipients during the progressive development of CR in terminal 
bronchioles (47). However, the OTT model is a model of large 
airway transplantation and successfully replicates the develop￾ment of fibrotic remodeling that develops to lymphocytic 
bronchitis, which is a key phase of large airway inflammation 
that can precede CR (1, 2, 44). Anatomically, orthotopic grafts 
remain exposed to air circulation, which provides a unique 
respiratory interface between donor–recipients microvascular 
blood flow after transplantation to favor natural physiological 
conditions. In addition, the orthotopic position of the graft 
further provides the preservation of the APC and lymphocyte 
trafficking pathways, which is very critical for the investigation 
of ongoing airway alloimmune responses during rejection (43). 
Based on previous studies, this is the most suitable model to 
examine donor–recipient microvascular connections, the 
real-time monitoring of blood flow and graft oxygenation dur￾ing rejection episodes.
Surgical Procedure
King Faisal specialist Hospital and Research Center Animal Care 
and Use Committee approved the experimental protocol adopted 
in this study. C57BL/6 (B6.H-2b
) were transplanted under sterile 
conditions with tracheas from B6 mice (syngeneic tracheal graft) 
and MHC-mismatched BALB/c (H-2d
) mice (allogeneic tracheal 
graft). 4–6 ring long tracheal segments from CO2 euthanized 
donor mice were dissected out and used as a grafts. C57BL/6 
recipient mice were anesthetized with ketamine (100  mg/kg) 
and xylazine (20 mg/kg), and a short incision was made in the 
middle neck region, which allowed division of strap muscles 
and visualization of the entire laryngotracheal complex. Finally, 
donor and recipient tracheas were connected together with 
10-0 nylon suture and the overlying skin was closed with 5-0 
silk suture (43, 48). All transplanted animals were given post￾operative medication Carprofen (dose 5 mg/kg SC) and Zolecin 
(dose 100  mg/kg  SC), and were regularly monitored for any 
respiratory distress-stridor in the first 24 h after surgery, and in 
case of any respiratory distress, the recipients were immediately 
euthanized by CO2.
Depletion of CD25+ Tregs
C57BL/6 mice were given i.p. injections of anti-mouse CD25 
(clone PC61) from BioXCell, USA (250 μg/day). To get maxi￾mum Treg depletion, all mice were treated for at least 7  days 
prior to the day of transplantation (24, 27, 49). Treg depletion 
was confirmed by flow cytometry using CD25 staining on 
CD4+FOXP3+ T cells.
AON-D21 and Blocking of C5a
AON-D21 is a PEGylated C5a-binding mixed RNA/DNA 
l-configured aptamer (50). The molecular weight of the oligonu￾cleotide portion is 13,167 Da. PEGylation with Y-shaped 40 kDa 
methoxy polyethylene glycol is done in order to increase the 
plasma half-life, mainly by reducing glomerular filtration. Due 
to its un-natural (mirror image) l-configuration, the aptamer 
AON-D21 is resistant to nuclease attack in blood (51). AON-D21 
originates from the l-aptamer NOX-D19, but has an improved 
affinity and may be easier to produce because it only consists of 
40 nucleotides, whereas NOX-D19 consisted of 44 nucleotides 
(7). To study the effects of the C5a neutralization, BALB/c 
(H-2d
)  →  C57BL/6 (H-2b
) allografts were given 10  mg/kg, 
of AON-D21 or vehicle (5% glucose) by i.p. injections on d0 and 
every second day thereafter.
Flow Cytometric Analysis
Blood was collected at selected time points posttransplantation 
through retro-orbital bleeding and collected in BD vacutainers. 
Briefly, lymphocytes were isolated by the Histopaque gradient 
separation method (52). After centrifugation at 400 ×g for 30 min, 
the buffy coat of lymphocytes was aspirated, and specific Treg 
markers (CD4, CD25, and FOXP3) were stained with fluorescently 
labeled rat anti-mouse antibodies, i.e., APC-CD4+ (Clone RM4-5 
RUO), PE-Cy7 CD25+ (Clone PC 61 RUO), and PE-conjugated

FOXP3+ (Clone MF23 RUO), respectively, as recommended by 
BD Pharmingen FOXP3 fixation and permeabilization assay, 
which specifically flow sort the CD4+CD25+FOXP3+ Treg sub￾population from mixed lymphocytes in systemic circulation. 
All were referenced to isotype control mouse IgG1-fluorescein 
isothiocyanate (FITC) (ab91356, abcam) to determine the 
background due to nonspecific antibody binding, and T  cells 
were confirmed with CD4 and CD3 coexpression. Data were 
recorded at the flow rate of 14 μl/min and a minimum of 500,000 
events were collected, and further analyzed through BD Accuri 
integrated software version C6.
Immunofluorescence Staining
All rejecting and anti-C5a treated allograft specimens were further 
examined by immunohistochemical staining for CD4+FOXP3+
Tregs in grafts. Briefly, tracheal transplants were harvested and 
processed in Tissue-Tek O.C.T. medium (Sakura Finetek, Japan). 
A cryostat (HM550; Microm) was utilized to cut 5 µm sections 
of the tracheal grafts and the sections were placed on superfrost/
plus slides (Fisher Scientific). After fixation in methanol/acetone 
(1:1) for 10 min at −20°C, the slides were washed with phosphate 
buffered saline (PBS). Next, graft sections were incubated with 
10% donkey serum for 30 min and then incubated for 1 h with 
either rat anti-mouse CD4 (BD biosciences, USA) or rabbit anti￾mouse FOXP3 (abcam, USA) primary antibodies. The slides were 
then washed with PBS, and sections were further incubated for 
1 h with Cy3 donkey anti-rat (Jackson Immuno research, USA) 
and Alexa 647 donkey anti-rabbit (Jackson Immuno research, 
USA) secondary antibodies. After incubation, sections were 
washed and mounted in Vectashield mounting medium (Vector 
Laboratories, USA). Immunofluorescence image analysis was 
performed with the EVOS FL auto cell imaging system (Life tech￾nologies, USA), Five random high-powered fields were captured 
per slide, and the percentage of colocalization was quantified 
through the mean integrated fluorescence intensity of the Alexa 
488-conjugated secondary antibody used to detect the CD4 
antigen, and the Alexa 647-conjugated secondary antibody used 
to detect FOXP3 deposition per treatment group using ImageJ 
program (7, 44, 46).
Assessment of Donor–Recipient 
Functional Microvasculature
The donor–recipient functional microvasculature was examined 
through whole mount graft fixations (46). Briefly, the transplanted 
and anesthetized mouse was injected with 100  μl of 1  mg/ml 
FITC-conjugated Lycopersicon esculentum tomato lectin into the 
inferior vena cava (44). After 5 min of FITC-lectin circulation, 
the vasculature was flushed with 1% paraformaldehyde (PFA) via
the aorta for 2 min, and the graft was harvested and fixed in 1% 
PFA at 4°C for 10 min. Next, the graft was mounted and exam￾ined by fluorescence microscopy (EVOS FL auto cell imaging 
system, Life technologies, USA), and morphometric assessment 
of % perfused microvasculature was quantified by capturing five 
random high-powered fields per slide, and the mean integrated 
fluorescent intensity was calculated per treatment group using 
ImageJ program (7, 46).
Assessment of Graft Oxygenation 
and Microvascular Blood Flow
The level of graft oxygenation (tpO2 mmHg) and blood perfu￾sion units (BPUs) during rejection were measured by combined 
oxygen and blood flow sensors (model NX-BF/OF/E, Oxford 
Optronix, UK) as described earlier with some modifications 
(7, 43, 46). Briefly, the transplanted mouse was anesthetized, the 
graft was exposed, a 23-G needle was used to make a hole in the 
anterior wall, and a combined oxygen and blood flow sensor was 
inserted at a <45° angle to contact the epithelium of the opposite 
wall of the trachea. The sensor was lowered gradually via the 
micromanipulator until the tpO2 levels decreases to 5 mmHg or 
less (indicating a zeroing effect induced by tissue compression). 
The sensor was then raised in small increments until the tpO2
and BPU reading plateaus and a consistent reading was obtained. 
The consistent pO2 was lost as the sensor continues to be lifted 
off the surface of the airway. The loss of contact of the sensor 
with the airway epithelium was indicated by a rapid rise to at 
least 60 mmHg indicating that luminal pO2 (rather than tracheal 
airway tissue pO2) was now being sensed by the sensor, and we 
typically take multiple readings and average the values (43, 48).
Histopathology and Collagen Staining
To demonstrate subepithelial deposition of collagen, anti-C5a 
treated and untreated allografts were harvested and processed in 
Tissue-Tek O.C.T. medium (Sakura Finetek, Japan). A cryostat 
(HM550; Microm) was utilized to cut 5  µm sections of the 
tracheal graft and the sections were placed on superfrost/plus 
slides (Fisher Scientific). Next, slides were stained by H&E and 
trichrome to detect airway epithelial structures and collagen 
deposition as described previously (53) and imaged using a Leica 
light microscope to localize collagen deposition. Morphometric 
analysis of collagen deposition was quantified by capturing five 
random high-powered fields per slide, and pixel numbers were 
converted into micrometers to calculate mean bandwidth (μm2
) 
per treatment group using ImageJ program (7, 54).
Quantitative PCR
RT-PCR analysis of pro-inflammatory, anti-inflammatory, and 
angiogenic genes was performed with some modifications (55). 
Briefly, total RNA from tracheal grafts was extracted using RNeasy 
mini kit 50 (Qiagen Sciences, MD, USA) and quantified using 
a NanoDrop 1000 spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies, 
USA). cDNA from each isolated RNA was synthesized with a high 
capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit (Applied Biosystems) 
and real-time PCR was performed using gene-specific primers 
on an AB 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR system in triplicates (Applied 
Biosystems) using power SYBR Green (Applied Biosystems). 
Data were analyzed with integrated software, and expression 
levels were analyzed by the 2−ΔΔCt method after normalization 
to the housekeeping gene glutaraldehyde dehydrogenase. We 
selected genes with expected regulatory (IL-10 and TGF-β), Treg 
induction-specific (IL-5), proangiogenic [vascular endothelial 
growth factor (VEGF) and ANGPT1], and inflammatory (IL-6) 
effects. A complete list of individual primers used in the present 
study is shown in Table 2.

ELISA
Quantitative estimation of serum cytokine levels was performed by 
Milliplex MAP Mouse Th17 Magnetic Bead (Cat # MTH17MAG￾47K), briefly, blood was collected in BD vacutainers, incubated 
at room temperature for at least 30 min, and then processed at 
1,200 RCF for 10 min, followed by serum aliquots into cryovials 
and stored at −80°C. As suggested by the manufacturer, samples 
or standards (6-point dilution) were mixed with antibody-linked 
magnetic beads on a 96-well plate and incubated overnight at 4°C 
with shaking. Plates were washed twice with wash buffer in a 
Biotek ELx405 washer. Following a 1-h incubation at room tem￾perature with biotinylated detection antibodies, streptavidin-PE 
was added for 30 min with shaking. Plates were washed as above, 
and PBS added to wells for reading in the Luminex 200 instru￾ment, with a lower limit of 100 beads per sample per cytokine. 
Each sample was measured in duplicates.
Statistical Analysis
GraphPad™ Prism software version 5 was used for statistical 
analysis to compare treated and untreated groups over time. 
Differences between various groups at multiple time points were 
compared using two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with 
post hoc Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons while 
results at one time point were analyzed by one-way ANOVA 
or two-tailed t-test and a p-value <0.05 was considered as 
significant.
RESULTS
Blocking C5a is Associated With 
CD4+CD25+FOXP3+ Treg Increase
Previously, it was reported that pro-inflammatory activities of 
C5a regulate adaptive immune responses, and affect the develop￾ment of Tregs through C5aR signaling, which drives Th1 matura￾tion (56–58). Here, we tested the impact of pharmacological C5a 
blockade by the l-aptamer AON-D21 on the frequency of Tregs 
in circulation and in grafts during allograft rejection. AON-D21, 
an improved form of the specific C5a inhibitor AON-D19, had 
been reported earlier to promote microvascular recovery and 
to limit airway remodeling during allograft rejection (7) but its 
effect on cellular immunity, especially on Tregs had not been 
investigated.
To assess peripheral and intragraft Treg counts during allo￾graft rejection, we grafted C57BL/6 (B6, H-2b
) with tracheas 
from MHC-incompatible BALB/c (H-2d
) donors. Peripheral 
CD4+CD25+FOXP3+ Treg counts were determined in blood lym￾phocytes collected from untreated BALB/c (H-2d
) →  C57BL/6 
(H-2b
) allografts and anti-C5a treated BALB/c (H-2d
) → C57BL/6 
(H-2b
) allografts at d6, d10, and d14 posttransplantation. Our 
initial findings showed that C5a neutralization leads to elevated 
levels of CD4+CD25+FOXP3+ Tregs, compared to untreated con￾trol allografts at d6 and d10 posttransplantation (Figures 1A–E). 
These findings indicate that C5a blockade has potential to 
modulate ongoing inflammation-mediated injuries and conse￾quently to slow down the process of rejection and microvascular 
injury. Although there was a significant increase in peripheral 
CD4+CD25+FOXP3+ Tregs at d6, d10, and d14 posttransplanta￾tion under C5a blockade, the CD4+FOXP3+/CD4 T cell ratio in 
this group was only on days 6 and 10 but not on day 14 lower than 
in the control group. This was due to a late drop in CD4+FOXP3+
lymphocytes while significant increase in CD4+ T cells occurred.
Because peripheral CD4+CD25+FOXP3+ Tregs have been asso￾ciated with improvements in donor–recipient microvascular blood 
flow, we next investigated whether the observed systemic increase 
in Tregs is also associated with a surge in subepithelial Tregs 
or drop in number of CD4+ T  cells in allograft. We performed 
immunofluorescent co-staining of anti-C5a-treated allografts for 
CD4 and FOXP3 at d10 posttransplantation. Immunofluorescence 
imaging showed an increased subepithelial colocalization of 
FOXP3 on CD4+ T cells in anti-C5a-treated allografts compared to 
untreated control allografts, which in previous studies overlapped 
with the day of microvascular rejection in untreated allografts 
(Figures  2A–D). The systemic increase in CD4+CD25+FOXP3+
Tregs was found to be directly proportional to the increase of 
intragraft CD4+FOXP3+ Tregs, which, we strongly believe will take 
part in maintaining microvascular repair. This latter observation is 
consistent with the fact that, in the current trachea transplantation 
model, subepithelial presence of CD4+FOXP3+ Tregs is associated 
with microvascular restoration and tissue repair (24, 27).

While the effects of C5a inhibition by the related l-aptamer 
NOX-D19 on vascular reestablishment, tpO2 blood perfusion 
had already been reported earlier (7), here we further delineated 
the effects of the follow-up drug candidate AON-D21 which 
surprisingly showed Treg induction in treated allografts. This 
prompted us to further investigate in detail the effects of C5a 
blockade on donor–recipient microvasculature, graft oxygena￾tion, and microvascular blood flow. As reported previously, Treg 
induction has been associated with vital improvements in 
microvascular blood flow, tpO2, and preserved donor–recipient 
microvascular flow during airway allograft rejection (24, 27). 
Therefore, the purpose of this study was to further study the

effects of pharmacological C5a inhibition on tpO2 and blood 
perfusion during airway allograft rejection. We hypothesized 
that C5a blockade-mediated Treg induction would reinstate 
donor–recipient microvasculature, and would thereby amelio￾rate microvascular flow and tpO2. In this therapeutic protocol, 
anti-C5a treated and untreated allografts were monitored for

tpO2, microvascular blood perfusion, and occurrence of donor–
recipient microvasculature in the course of airway rejection.
First, to investigate anti-C5a-mediated microvascular rees￾tablishment and associated donor–recipient microvasculature 
tissue repair in rejecting allografts, we grafted C57BL/6 recipi￾ents with tracheas from MHC-incompatible BALB/c donors 
(allografts) or from C57BL/6 donors (syngrafts). To further 
investigate microvascular recovery, anti-C5a-treated allografts 
were examined by FITC-lectin binding assay, which specifically 
detects the pattern of donor–recipient functional microvas￾culature during rejection (7, 41, 46). We found that syngrafts 
remained perfused with high vascular density throughout the 
period of transplantation. In the allograft setting, anti-C5a￾treated allografts showed improved microvascular perfusion 
at d8, d10–d13, and d28 as compared to untreated control 
allografts, which lost perfusion and remained poorly perfused 
with significantly lower vascular density (Figures 3A,B). These 
findings support the notion that C5a neutralization promotes 
the microvascular reestablishment. Furthermore, these findings 
supported that enhanced microvascular density in anti-C5a￾treated allografts may be crucial for maintaining high oxygena￾tion and perfused microvascular state.
To test this, we examined the levels of tpO2 and microvas￾cular blood flow (measured in BPUs) in syngrafts, untreated

control allografts, and anti-C5a-treated allografts from d4–d28 
posttransplantation (Figures  4A,B). Our results demonstrate 
that BALB/c → C57BL/6 untreated control allografts, BALB/
c → C57BL/6 anti-C5a-treated allografts, and C57BL/6 → C57BL/6 
syngrafts showed a significant increase (p <  0.05) in tpO2
and BPUs after first graft donor–recipients microvascular 
hookup at d4, and thereafter all experimental groups remain 
oxygenated until d8 posttransplantation (Figures  4A,B). At later 
time points, C57BL/6 → C57BL/6 syngrafts remain oxygen￾ated and perfused until d28 posttransplantation without any 
sign of donor–recipient microvascular loss and associated 
ischemia. However, BALB/c → C57BL/6 untreated control allo￾grafts pass through an extended period of hypoxia and ischemia 
from d9–d14 and only show a late but inadequate recovery in 
both tpO2 and blood microvascular perfusion by d28 posttrans￾plantation (Figures 4A,B). Next, we examined BALB/c → C57BL/6

anti-C5a-treated allografts, and our initial findings demonstrated 
significant improvements both in tpO2 and blood microvascular 
perfusion leading to a reduced overall hypoxic and ischemic 
period of anti-C5a-treated allografts. In detail, our data reveal 
that anti-C5a-treated allografts remain significantly oxygen￾ated (21.72–19.25  mmHg tpO2) and perfused (998-581  BPUs)

at d9–d13 and only showed a brief period of hypoxic/ischemic 
phase around d14 followed by a significant and rapid rise of tpO2
and BPUs until d20–d28 posttransplantation (Figures  4A,B). 
Furthermore, to better understand the mechanism behind the 
correlation between Tregs, C5a blockade and the microvascular 
restoration, we first depleted the Tregs with anti-mouse CD25 
(clone PC61), and then treated Treg-depleted transplants with the 
C5a-neutralizing l-aptamer to validate the potential tolerogenic 
effects of C5a blockade. Our results supported the notion that Treg 
depletion is associated with a drop in both tpO2 and low blood flow 
state. In addition, subsequent C5a blockade was found sufficient to 
recover the tissue oxygen and blood flow at d8 posttransplantation 
(Figures 4C,D).
In summary, syngrafts remain oxygenated/perfused from d4 
of microvascular hookup until d28 of posttransplantation without 
any sign of microvascular loss at d10/d14 but rejecting allografts 
pass through a comparatively shorter oxygenated phase from d4 
to d9 and are progressively hypoxic/ischemic from d10 to d14 
posttransplantation, while anti-C5a-treated allografts showed an 
extended period of graft oxygenation from d4 to d13 followed 
by a reversible microvascular loss at d14, which confirmed that 
anti-C5a-treated allografts enjoyed a longer period of oxygena￾tion and blood microvascular flow, and therefore they pass only 
through a brief phase of hypoxic and ischemic state compared 
to untreated allografts (Figures  4A,B). This brief phase of low 
tpO2 and BPUs in anti-C5a-treated transplants is followed by a 
rapid rise in tpO2 and BPUs compared to untreated transplants 
supported the notion that anti-C5a-mediated Treg induction is 
involved in microvascular improvements (Figures  4A,B). Of 
note, anti-CD25-mediated Treg depletion subdued tpO2 and 
blood flow, while concomitant C5a blockade improved tissue 
oxygen and blood flow. Collectively, these findings indicate that C5a 
blocking delays the onset of acute rejection, and thereby shortens 
the phase of hypoxia/ischemia as seen in untreated allografts 
(Figures 4A–D).
Blocking C5a Limits Airway Epithelial 
Injury and Prevents Collagen Deposition
Airway epithelial injury and deposition of collagen are the 
leading pathological events, and key irreversible pathological

state of severe hypoxia/ischemia, and ultimately develop fibrotic 
remodeling during the terminal phase of CR (46). To investigate 
these pathological changes, we performed H&E and trichrome 
staining on untreated allografts and anti-C5a-treated experimen￾tal groups on d28 posttransplantation. Microscopic examinations 
of H&E demonstrated that C5a inhibition resulted in healthier 
epithelium at d28 as compared to untreated control allografts, 
which remain denuded and do not show any associated tissue 
repair/healthy epithelium (Figures 5A). In addition, trichrome 
staining of anti-C5a-treated allografts showed a significant drop 
in subepithelial collagen deposition at d28 compared to untreated 
control allografts (Figures 5B,C).

we compared the leukocyte gene expression and serum cytokine 
levels in treated and control allografts. Quantitative PCR analysis 
revealed that anti-C5a-treated allografts showed a significant 
increase in mRNA transcript of IL-5, TGF-β, IL-10, VEGF, and 
ANGPT1 compared to untreated control allografts (Figures 6A–
E). In addition, expression of IL-6, which is responsible for 
tissue-specific inflammation during acute rejection in untreated 
control allografts, was reduced in anti-C5a-treated allografts 
(Figure  6F). Figures  6G–L demonstrated a significant drop in 
levels of IFN-γ, IL-6, and IL-15, while significant increase in 
TGF-β, IL-5, and IL-10 serum cytokine levels in anti-C5a treated 
allografts. Thus, potential effectors of immunomodulatory activ￾ity of C5a blockade are IL-10 and IL-5, which most likely affect 
the microvascular-associated recoveries during transplantation. 
We next investigated if pharmacologic C5a blockade promotes 
expression of gene transcripts relevant for allograft rejection, in 
anti-C5a-treated allografts and untreated control allografts at d10 
posttransplantation. These findings indicate that enhanced micro￾vascular reestablishment in anti-C5a-treated allograft recipients 
occurred mainly because of turning on of proangiogenic mRNA 
gene transcripts, which facilitated the process of microvascular 
reestablishment.
Furthermore, to confirm the cellular source of these pro￾inflammatory cytokines and regulatory cytokines, we collected 
serum at d10 from Treg-depleted allografts along with control 
allografts, and quantified IL-10 (regulatory cytokine) and IL-6 
(pro-inflammatory cytokine). Our initial data shows that “Treg￾depleted” serum samples were found low in IL-10 levels compared 
to allografts, while IL-6 levels were not affected compared to allo￾graft controls. These data raise the possibility of Tregs as one of 
the major source of IL-10 as seen in serum from anti-C5a-treated 
allografts which had more IL-10 than vehicle-treated allografts 
(Figures 6H,L).
DISCUSSION
The association between the complement pathway and Tregs has 
been well reported (59). Tregs play a crucial role in maintaining 
immune tolerance in both preclinical studies and are also associ￾ated with improved long-term transplant outcomes in clinical 
studies (60, 61).
Herein, we tested, whether and how pharmacologic C5a inhi￾bition by the C5a-binding aptamer AON-D21 modulated the 
peripheral and intragraft numbers of Tregs during orthotopic 
trachea transplantation. We observed that targeted blocking of 
C5a signaling augments peripheral CD4+FOXP3+Treg numbers 
improves microvascular blood flow, and, as a consequence, limits 
tissue injury and collagen deposition during allograft rejection. 
The present study was designed to evaluate whether induction of 
Tregs after complement C5a blockade supports the reestablish￾ment of microvasculature of rejecting allograft and improves 
tpO2 and blood perfusion. Our results indicate that C5a blockade 
induces an increase in peripheral CD4+CD25+FOXP3+ Tregs and 
within the graft which is accompanied by an upregulation of IL-5, 
TGF-β, IL-10, VEGF, and ANGPT1, and reduced IL-6 mRNA 
gene expression. In additional studies of cytokine concentrations, 
C5a blockade led to a significant increase in serum levels of 
TGF-β, IL-5, and IL-10, while reduced levels of IFN-γ, IL-6, and 
IL-15 were observed. Altogether, this favorable environment 
seems to contribute to an improved, i.e., anti-inflammatory 
and more angiogenic balance of the immune system during the 
allograft microvascular repair, and may help to establish a state 
of immunotolerance. Earlier, it was demonstrated that blocking/
or genetic deficiency of C3aR/C5aR on Tregs enhanced their 
in vitro and in vivo suppressive activity and prolonged allogeneic 
skin graft survival (40). Additional studies demonstrated that 
C3aR/C5aR deficiency/or blockade stimulates murine Tregs, 
stabilizes FOXP3 gene expression, prevents Treg conversion 
to IFN-γ/TNF-α producing T effector cells, and thereby limits 
graft versus host disease (59,). Liu et al. reported an antagonistic 
effect between CD4+CD25− T  cells and CD4+CD25+ Tregs on 
macrophage M1 and M2 polarization, respectively (62, 63). 
In addition, CD25highFOXP3+ were the dominant cell type 
which indicated that C5a inhibition supports the induction of 
this Treg subgroup, which has stronger immune-suppressive 
properties than CD25lowFOXP3+ Tregs. FOXP3 is the most 
specific intracellular Treg marker; it is strongly associated with 
the survival and function of Tregs (64–66). Our results dem￾onstrated that CD4+CD25+ cells from treated allograft recipient 
blood express high levels of FOXP3, whereas FOXP3 and CD25 
expression in untreated allograft recipients was considerably 
lower. Our results also demonstrated that reduced infiltration 
of CD4+ effector T  cells in anti-C5a-treated allograft are in 
agreement with previous findings which supports the notion 
that CD4+CD25+FOXP3+ cells are more suppressive (67). BALB/
c→C57BL/6 allografts exhibited low expression of FOXP3 and 
CD25 during allograft rejection and, as expected, low tpO2
and blood perfusion levels were noted. To check the effect of 
C5a neutralization in BALB/c→C57BL/6 allografts, we used a 
novel anti-C5a l-aptamer, AON-D21, and showed that targeted 
blocking resulted in improved microvascular repair, improved 
tpO2 and a higher number of peripheral and allograft resident 
FOXP3+ Tregs. In addition, CD4+ T  cell-mediated inflamma￾tion was limited, suggesting that pharmacologic C5a inhibition 
triggers the induction of CD25+FOXP3+ Tregs which support 
the reparative phase of rejecting allograft through microvascular 
reestablishment. Furthermore, reestablishment of microvascu￾lar flow in C5a-treated allografts is highly correlated with the 
maintenance of normal airway structural recovery which is 
characterized by relatively low subepithelial fibrosis and healthy 
ciliated pseudostratified columnar epithelium compared to 
severely damaged airway epithelium and significantly higher 
collagen deposition in untreated allografts. Clinical studies 
from obstructive bronchitis reported that epithelial cell destruc￾tion during persistent inflammation occurs due to a variety 
of inflammatory mediators in small airways, which impede 
epithelium regeneration and promote fibro-proliferation due to 
aberrant tissue repair. These epithelial injuries have been rec￾ognized as a key intermediate step that is ultimately leading to 
obliterative airway disease (68–71). In conclusion, we reported 
that blockage of C5a triggers activation and expansion of 
CD4+FOXP3+ circulating Tregs. The delineation of this formerly 
uncharacterized mechanism favors the possibility that targeted 

13

blocking of C5a could be exploited to rescue microvascular loss 
during allograft rejection, and limiting C5a/C5aR signaling on 
Tregs could be used to induce Treg activation and regulatory 
functions, thereby enhancing Treg responses in allografts. It is 
known that complement activation and signaling through C3aR 
and C5aR suppress regulatory functions of murine natural 
regulatory T cells through FOXP3 expression (11). In addition, 
immune cell-derived complement also impacts human T-cell 
immunity and GvHD, highlighting the scope of complement 
blockade for GvHD treatment (41, 73). These preclinical and 
clinical findings provide proof of concept that C5a blockage is 
a key target for facilitating Treg-mediated transplant tolerance 
(7, 72). Recently, it was reported that anti-C5a treatment is 
associated with a decrease of pro-inflammatory chemokines, 
inhibition of infiltration of neutrophils, and enhanced Th2 
response in a murine model of colitis (74). C5a receptors also 
play a key role in modulating alloreactivity of Tregs which are 
the main regulatory cell responsible for tissue repair during 
extensive allograft injury, and mediate tolerance to alloantigens 
in humans (56). Complement antagonism as a therapeutic alter￾native or addition necessitates a comprehensive information 
about the mechanisms of complement activation, cell types, and 
cell mediators responsible for the inflammation and associated 
tissue injuries. Various approaches to inhibit the complement 
system have been tested in preclinical models, particularly in 
ischemia/reperfusion injury, and in transplantation. Most of the 
previous investigations had proposed that a successful treat￾ment with a specific complement-inhibitor is the ultimate proof 
that complement plays an essential role in the pathogenesis 
of disease.
Taken together, these findings highlight the key modulatory 
effects of complement on T cell-mediated alloimmune reactions, 
and further demonstrate a proof of concept that targeting C5a 
blockade could facilitate Treg-mediated tolerance to alloantigens 
(Figure  7). Consequently, the anti-C5a l-aptamer AON-D21 
could be exploited to promote induction of immune tolerance 
to alloantigens in clinical settings as standalone or combination 
therapy to subdue the severe toxic effects of ongoing immunosup￾pressive regimens.
