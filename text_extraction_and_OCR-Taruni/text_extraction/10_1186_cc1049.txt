The article by Vizza and colleagues in this issue of Critical
Care (page 355) raises interesting questions about the
clinical relevance of pulmonary hypertension in chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) [1]. This form of
pulmonary hypertension is generally believed to be hypoxic in
origin and to be associated with only mild to moderate
increases in mean pulmonary artery pressures (Ppa),
amenable to supplemental oxygen. However, recent studies
suggest a rather more complex pathobiology, leading to
severe pulmonary hypertension in some patients, who might
therefore benefit from more active and specific therapy.
Nature of pulmonary hypertension in COPD
Pulmonary vascular remodeling in COPD is more than just
medial hypertrophy from long-lasting hypoxic vasoconstriction
[2,3]. In fact, as illustrated in Fig. 1, all layers of the vessel
wall appear to be involved, with intimal changes being the
most prominent. This peculiar pathological picture could be
explained by the combined effects of hypoxia, mechanical
stress and/or inflammatory reaction due to repeated
stretching of hyperinflated lungs [2], and, very importantly,
the toxic effects of cigarette smoke [3]. Chronic hypoxia at
high altitudes induces isolated medial hypertrophy (with,
sometimes, longitudinal deposition of a few smooth muscle
fibers in the intima) and is associated with complete reversal
of pulmonary hypertension a few weeks after return to sea
level [4]. Pulmonary hypertension in COPD often is not, or is
only minimially, reversible by supplemental oxygen, acutely [5]
or chronically [6].
Pulmonary hypertension in COPD is generally limited to an
increase in mean pulmonary artery pressure (Ppa) to
25–35 mmHg in the face of a normal cardiac output (Q) [7].

Abstract
Pulmonary hypertension is a common complication of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
The increase in pulmonary artery pressures is often mild to moderate, but some patients may suffer from
severe pulmonary hypertension, and present with a progressively downhill clinical course because of
right-sided heart failure added to ventilatory handicap. The cause of pulmonary hypertension in COPD is
generally assumed to be hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction leading to permanent medial hypertrophy.
However, recent pathological studies point, rather, to extensive remodeling of the pulmonary arterial
walls, with prominent intimal changes. These aspects account for minimal reversibility with supplemental
oxygen. There may be a case for pharmacological treatment of pulmonary hypertension in selected
patients with advanced COPD and right-sided heart failure. Candidate drugs include prostacyclin
derivatives, endothelin antagonists and inhaled nitric oxide, all of which have been reported of clinical
benefit in primary pulmonary hypertension. However, it will be a challenge for randomized controlled
trials to overcome the difficulties of the diagnosis of right ventricular failure and the definition of a
relevant primary endpoint in pulmonary hypertensive COPD patients.

pressures higher than 40 mmHg are not uncommon,
especially in patients with at least one previous episode of
acute respiratory failure [7]. The experience of patients with
primary pulmonary hypertension, in whom the disease
process is limited to the pulmonary vasculature, shows that
pulmonary artery pressures higher than 35–40 mmHg are
associated with clinical right ventricular failure and limited
exercise capacity [8].
Dobutamine versus exercise stress tests
How to detect COPD patients prone to the development of
severe pulmonary hypertension? One could imagine a
dobutamine stress test would be revealing, with the rationale
that an increase in flow would be associated with an abnormal
increase in Ppa because of a restricted pulmonary vascular
bed. However, in most patients with COPD, the increase in
Ppa with blood flow is less than predicted by the pulmonary
vascular resistance (PVR) equation. Unilateral balloon
occlusion studies have shown that the passive Ppa:Q curve in
COPD is shifted to higher pressures with a decreased slope
and an increased extrapolated pressure intercept [9],
suggesting vascular closure [10]. The same phenomenon was
observed with dobutamine in Vizza’s study [1], which is not
surprising, because a low dose of dobutamine increases flow
without having an intrinsic effect on pulmonary vascular tone
[11]. Vascular closure in COPD can be explained by high
pulmonary volume-induced stretching of alveolar vessels and
dynamic hyperinflation, as well as by remodeling of the
pulmonary arteries. As illustrated in Fig. 2, a Ppa:Q
relationship with decreased slope makes calculated PVR
unreliable for the estimation of changes in the functional state
of pulmonary resistive vessels at variable flow. In other words,
a decrease in PVR brought about by dobutamine should not
be interpreted as a pulmonary vasodilation.
Exercise has been used to detect familial susceptibility to
pulmonary hypertension [12]. Exercise in COPD may be
associated with marked increases in Ppa, especially when
there is pre-existing pulmonary hypertension at rest [13].
Patients with exercise-induced pulmonary hypertension are
particularly prone to develop resting pulmonary hypertension
in the long term [14]. As illustrated in Fig. 2, the increase in
Ppa in exercising COPD patients is greater than predicted by
the PVR equation, indicating pulmonary vasoconstriction
[15]. This unexpectedly large increase may be due to
enhancement of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction by

decreased mixed venous partial pressure of oxygen,
increased tone of the sympathetic nervous system, and
decreased arterial pH due to aggravated hypercapnia or
lactic acidosis or both. Changes in intrathoracic pressures
may also play a role. An exercise-induced increase in
ventilation may aggravate dynamic hyperinflation and thereby
increase alveolar pressure at expiration. Increased ventilation
in the presence of obstructed airways is associated with
markedly negative inspiratory pleural pressures. Negative
pleural pressures are associated with decreased ventricular
pressures relative to alveolar pressure and therefore
correspond to an increase in right ventricular afterload.
Right ventricular failure and its treatment
Severe pulmonary hypertension increases right ventricular
afterload and eventually leads to the clinical syndrome of
right-sided heart failure with systemic congestion and inability
to adapt right ventricular output to peripheral demand at
exercise. Many patients with advanced COPD present with
ankle edema but normal right atrial pressures (at rest) [16].
This apparent paradox has stimulated speculation that edema
in COPD might be a renal rather than a right ventricular
problem [17]. However, edema in COPD is probably
explained by repeated stretching of the right atrium because
of increased right ventricular diastolic pressures at exercise
or conceivably during sleep apneas, causing increased tone
of the sympathetic nervous system and activation of the
renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system, with resultant renal
retention of salt and water [18]. Such retention may be
aggravated by hypercapnia [17,18].
What could be done to relieve the overloaded right ventricle
in COPD? In addition to optimal bronchodilation to limit
dynamic hyperinflation and negative pleural pressure swings,
oxygen to correct hypoxemia, and diuretics to limit salt and
water retention, it might be possible to limit pulmonary
vascular remodeling by pharmacological interventions.
Pulmonary arteries from patients who have COPD show
impaired endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation [19,20].
Pulmonary arteries from heavy smokers present show a
reduction in expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase
[21]. Altered endothelial function, with a vasodilator–
vasoconstrictor imbalance, appears to play a role in the
progression of primary pulmonary hypertension [8].
Accordingly, prostacyclin derivatives, given intravenously
[22], subcutaneously [23], by inhalation [24] or even orally
[25], and endothelin-receptor antagonists [26], have been
reported to improve the condition of patients with primary
pulmonary hypertension. Inhaled nitric oxide, given as pulses
together with supplemental oxygen, might also be effective
[27]. It thus appears possible to restore the endothelial
vasoconstrictor–dilator imbalance.
Conclusions
At this stage, a randomized, controlled trial with one of
these agents might be justified in patients with advanced
COPD and clinically significant right-sided heart failure.
There could be concern that vasodilators might aggravate
hypoxemia by increasing ventilation/perfusion mismatching
through an inhibition of hypoxic vasoconstriction or/and an
increase in blood flow [15,28,29]. However, since most of
the hypoxemia in COPD is caused by low ventilation/
perfusion ratios, rather than by an intrapulmonary shunt, this
can be easily corrected by a slight increase in supplemental
oxygen [30].
