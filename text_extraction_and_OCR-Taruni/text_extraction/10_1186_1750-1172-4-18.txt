Abstract
Kaposi sarcoma is a low-grade mesenchymal tumor involving blood and lymphatic vessels. There are four variants of this disease,
each presenting a different clinical manifestation: classic or sporadic, African or endemic, organ transplant-related or iatrogenic,
and AIDS-related or epidemic. Kaposi sarcoma is the most common tumor among patients with HIV infection, occurring
predominantly in homosexual or bisexual men. The pulmonary involvement in Kaposi sarcoma occurs commonly in critically
immunosupressed patients who commonly have had preceding mucocutaneous or digestive involvement.
The etiology of Kaposi sarcoma is not precisely established; genetic, hormonal, and immune factors, as well as infectious agents,
have all been implicated. There is evidence from epidemiologic, serologic, and molecular studies that Kaposi sarcoma is
associated with human herpes virus type 8 infection. The disease starts as a reactive polyclonal angioproliferative response
towards this virus, in which polyclonal cells change to form oligoclonal cell populations that expand and undergo malignant
transformation.
The diagnosis of pulmonary involvement in Kaposi sarcoma usually can be made by a combination of clinical, radiographic, and
laboratory findings, together with the results of bronchoscopy and transbronchial biopsy. Chest high-resolution computed
tomography scans commonly reveal peribronchovascular and interlobular septal thickening, bilateral and symmetric ill-defined
nodules in a peribronchovascular distribution, fissural nodularity, mediastinal adenopathies, and pleural effusions. Correlation
between the high-resolution computed tomography findings and the pathology revealed by histopathological analysis
demonstrate that the areas of central peribronchovascular infiltration represent tumor growth involving the bronchovascular
bundles, with nodules corresponding to proliferations of neoplastic cells into the pulmonary parenchyma. The interlobular septal
thickening may represent edema or tumor infiltration, and areas of ground-glass attenuation correspond to edema and the filling
of air spaces with blood. These findings are a result of the propensity of Kaposi sarcoma to grow in the peribronchial and
perivascular axial interstitial spaces, often as continuous sheets of tumor tissue.
In conclusion, radiological findings can play a major role in the diagnosis of pulmonary Kaposi sarcoma since characteristic
patterns may be observed. The presence of these patterns in patients with AIDS is highly suggestive of Kaposi sarcoma.

Review
Introduction
Kaposi sarcoma (KS) was first described by Moritz von
Kaposi in 1872 as a low-grade mesenchymal tumor
involving blood and lymphatic vessels. The mucocutane￾ous sites are primarily affected, typically the skin of the
lower extremities, face, trunk, genitalia, and oropharyn￾geal mucosa; other organs are involved in the dissemi￾nated form of the disease [1,3]. This disease is recognized
to arise as four variants, each presenting a different clinical
manifestation: classic or sporadic, African or endemic,
organ transplant-related or iatrogenic, and acquired
immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related or epidemic
[1,4,5].
KS is the most common tumor among patients with
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, occur￾ring predominantly in homosexual or bisexual men [6,7].
Also, an increasing number of reports describe KS as a
complication of solid organ transplantation [1,5,8,9].
Pulmonary involvement generally occurs in severely
immunosupressed patients who already have mucocuta￾neous or digestive involvement [6].
Epidemiology
KS is one of the major complications of AIDS [10]. In
industrialized countries, KS occurs in patients of all ages,
primarily homosexual males; it is much less common in
heterosexual males, being observed in less than 10% of
patients in other groups at risk for HIV infection
[6,11,12]. The use of highly active antiretroviral therapies
(HAART) has lead to a decline in the incidence of KS
[6,13,14]. Recent studies showed that the incidence of KS
decreased from 30/1000 patient-years in the pre-HAART
era to 0.03/1000 patient-years in the HAART era [15].
Critical immunosupression in patients with mucocutane￾ous KS commonly leads to pulmonary involvement. Tho￾racic disease is found in about 45% of patients with
cutaneous AIDS-related KS, and in about 15% of patients
without mucocutaneous involvement [5]. It must be
noted that these high rates of pulmonary disease refer to
autopsy findings, in the pre-HAART era. Currently, after
the introduction of this therapy, pulmonary involvement
has probably become much less frequent. Palmieri et al
[10]. studied the clinicopathological differences between
patients with and without pulmonary KS diagnosed in the
era of HAART. The authors concluded that in HIV-1-
infected patients diagnosed with KS, pulmonary involve￾ment was associated with a low CD4 cell count, suggesting
that pulmonary KS may be related to late presentation of
HIV disease [10].
Pathology and Pathogenesis
The etiology of KS is not precisely established; genetic,
hormonal, and immune factors, as well as infectious
agents, have all been implicated. There is evidence from
epidemiologic, serologic, and molecular studies that KS is
associated with human herpes virus type 8 (HHV8) infec￾tion [1,6,13]. In addition, other agents such as cytokine￾induced growth factors have been linked to the develop￾ment of the disease [1,5].
The presence of KS associated with HHV-8 and host
immunosuppression are considered the major factors that
promote tumor development [8,16-18]. The disease starts
as a reactive polyclonal angioproliferative response
towards HHV-8, in which polyclonal cells change to form
oligoclonal cell populations that expand and undergo
malignant transformation [19].
The histopathologic process of the disease is believed to
start in the sub epithelial connective tissue, extending in
the direction of the epithelium. A developed lesion con￾sists of interwoven bands of spindle cells and vascular
structures grouped in a network of reticular and collagen
fibers. Erythrocytes are seen within these vascular struc￾tures and interspersed between spindle cells. The vascular
component appears as small capillaries or slit-like spaces
between the spindle cells [11].
Clinical Manifestations
Generally, patients with lung KS have previously treated
cutaneous lesions or other visceral involvement, for exam￾ple in the gastrointestinal tract. Nonetheless, cutaneous
involvement is absent in 5–23% of patients with sympto￾matic pulmonary KS [11]. The most common symptoms
are progressive dyspnea, non-productive cough, and fever.
Although some authors have described fever as a common
finding, it cannot be distinguished from superimposed
infection [11,20,21]. Pleural effusion with chest pain,
hypoxemia, and acute respiratory failure requiring
mechanical ventilation have also been reported. Physical
examination of the thorax is usually normal, but non-spe￾cific signs such as crackles, wheezing, and stridor may be
present [11].
Four clinical variants of KS have been described [1,5]. The
histological findings are identical between the variants,
but each affects distinct populations and shows character￾istic sites of involvement and rates of progression. The
classic variant primarily affects elderly men of Eastern
European and Mediterranean origin, and Ashkenazi Jews;
it is more common in men than in women, by a ratio as
high as 15 to 1 [5,8]. There is a cutaneous asymptomatic
form of the disease, presenting with multiple firm, purple￾blue or reddish-brown plaques and nodules, distributed
mainly in the lower limbs. Untreated lesions evolve to
plaques and ulcerated nodules, with venous stasis and
lymphedema. A second type of the classic variant of KS
comprises a more aggressive form, with rapid progression,
presenting with disseminated mucocutaneous and vis-

ceral lesions [5,8]. The second variant, African or endemic
KS, affects men in East and Central Africa in the 4th dec￾ade of life, with a male-female ratio of 17:1. This form of
KS is clinically similar to the classic form, although with a
more aggressive variant that responds poorly to conven￾tional treatment [5,8]. The third variant, KS related to
solid organ-transplantation, is considered a complication
related to chronic drug-induced immunosuppression. The
median interval from organ transplantation to diagnosis
is 29 to 31 months. This type of KS tends to be aggressive,
involving lymph nodes, mucosa, and visceral organs in
about half of the patients, sometimes in the absence of
skin lesions [8]. AIDS-related KS, the fourth variant, is an
aggressive epidemic form involving lymph nodes, viscera,
and mucosa as well as skin. This type of KS affects pre￾dominantly homosexual men with AIDS and may be fatal
in the absence of HAART and KS-specific treatment.
HAART has been shown to have a dramatic effect on KS in
patients with AIDS. Since the introduction of this treat￾ment, a substantial decrease in the incidence and preva￾lence of HIV-KS as well as regression of established KS
lesions have been reported [22,23]. The use of HAART
increases overall survival in patients with KS and is associ￾ated with an 80% reduction in the risk of death among KS
patients [24]. About 20% of deaths are related to compli￾cations of the disease itself (upper airway obstruction,
hemorrhage, or parenchymal destruction), but the major￾ity of deaths are related to other factors (eg, concomitant
infection) [5].
Bronchoscopy
The extent of tracheobronchial KS ranges from isolated
tracheal lesions to diffuse and/or extensive tracheobron￾chial involvement. Endobronchial lesions may narrow
and partially obstruct the airways. The bronchoscopic
appearance of endobronchial KS is considered to be char￾acteristic enough to allow a diagnosis. When broncho￾scopic examination identifies KS lesions below the level of
the carina, accompanying parenchymal abnormalities are
seen, as a rule, on chest radiography or CT. Thus, the
appearance of characteristic tracheobronchial KS lesions
is sufficient to make a presumptive diagnosis of pulmo￾nary KS [25,26].
Treatment
There is increasing evidence that HAART and an improved
immune response are associated with complete or partial
regression of KS lesions, a decrease in the number of
patients suffering from KS, improved survival, and protec￾tion of HIV-infected patients against the development of
KS [13,14]. In patients using HAART, regression of the
lesions correlates with a decrease in plasma HIV load and
improved immune response [13]. Some studies showed
that HAART alone can lead to stabilization and regression
of KS, often eliminating the need of chemotherapy and
radiation therapy, and prolonging remission among

patients with a complete response. Patients with pulmo￾nary KS using HAART showed a median survival time of
1.6 years compared with a median survival time of 4
months in the pre-HAART era [10].
Imaging Diagnosis: Chest X-Ray and CT Findings
The diagnosis of pulmonary involvement in KS usually
can be made by a combination of clinical, radiographic,
and laboratory findings, together with the results of bron￾choscopy and transbronchial biopsy [27]. KS may involve
the tracheo-bronchial tree, the pulmonary parenchyma,
and the pleura [20,21,28]. Pleural involvement generally
occurs only in the presence of parenchymal abnormali￾ties. Also, the presence of lesions in the bronchial tree
below the carina is commonly accompanied by parenchy￾mal findings [28,29]. Thus, there is consensus that the
presence of lesions characteristic of KS in the tracheo￾bronchial tree is sufficient for a presumptive diagnosis of
pulmonary KS.
Chest radiography may demonstrate middle to lower lung
zone reticular opacities and parenchymal nodules with a
bronchovascular distribution that may progress to consol￾idation, peribronchial cuffing, Kerley B lines, pleural col￾lections, and hilar or mediastinal adenopathies [5]
(Figure 1). HRCT scans have more specificity and sensitiv￾ity than the chest X-rays, and can provide important data
leading to suspicion of the diagnosis of pulmonary KS.
The most frequent CT finding is interstitial thickening,
involving the peribronchovascular sheaths, often begin￾ning in the peri-hilar regions and then progressing to the
periphery. The peribronchovascular thickening may be
associated with irregular narrowing of the bronchial
lumen by mucous lesions (Figure 2). The involvement is
predominant in the middle and lower thirds of the lungs,
preserving the upper lobes of the lungs. The confluence of
the lesions leads to progressive air-space consolidation,
possibly with a component of airway obstruction. Other
HRCT scan findings are interlobular septal thickening,
usually preserving the lobular architecture and simulating
carcinomatous lymphangitis; large parenchymal nodules
with irregular, poorly defined, and spiculated borders
(Figure 3), some of them with a perinodular ground glass
halo sign and air bronchograms; fissural nodularity;
ground-glass opacities (Figure 4); mediastinal adenopa￾thies; and pleural effusions [5,11,20,21,27,28,30-32]
(Figure 5).

The sensitivity of HRCT in the diagnosis of endobronchial
KS is not high, but tumors large enough to cause stridor in
the upper airways or atelectasis in small segmental or
lobar bronchi are generally seen as filling defects in the
endobronchial lumen. Endoluminal lesions are infre￾quently detected by HRCT; thickening of the bronchial
walls and interstitium, representing tumor infiltration
along the interstitium, is much more common [20,33].
Correlation of HRCT and Pathologic Findings
The imaging findings of pulmonary KS reflect the propen￾sity of KS to grow in the peribronchial and perivascular
axial interstitial spaces extending to the peripheral
regions, often as continuous sheets of tumor tissue (Figure
6). Thus central peribronchovascular infiltration repre￾sents confluent tumor, and irregular nodular opacities are
interpreted as tumor proliferation extending into the
parenchyma. Cellular infiltration of the pulmonary
parenchyma begins with invasion of the interstitial space,
with occupation of the peribronchovascular tissue along
the pulmonary vessels and the pleural surface. The tumor
cells progress from these locations to the adjacent alveolar
spaces, filling the alveoli and forming solid irregular nod￾ules. The peripheral interstitial compartment and visceral

pleural surfaces can also become affected (Figure 7). The
interlobular septa may be thickened by edema or diffuse
infiltration by tumor cells [28,31,34,35] (Figure 8).
Silva Filho et al. [32] reported the association of the
"crazy-paving" pattern with peribronchovascular thicken￾ing in patients with pulmonary KS. This pathological cor￾relation demonstrated that the areas of ground-glass
attenuation represented edema and filling of air spaces
with blood, and that the interlobular septal thickening
was related to the infiltration of the interlobular septa by
neoplastic cells (Figure 9).
Conclusion
In conclusion, tomographic findings can play an impor￾tant role in the diagnosis of pulmonary KS, since charac￾teristic patterns may be observed. The most frequent chest

interstitium, particularly in the axial portions; irregular
and poorly defined nodules; and interlobular septal thick￾ening. The presence of these findings in patients with
AIDS is highly suggestive of KS. Correct interpretation of
the HRCT patterns, understanding of the histopathologi￾cal appearance, and association of the histopathological
and radiological findings can be very useful to the radiol￾ogist in the correct diagnosis of pulmonary KS.
