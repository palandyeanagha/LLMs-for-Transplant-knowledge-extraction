Abstract
Objectives: To establish arterial spin labelling (ASL) for quantitative renal perfusion measurements in a rat model at 3 Tesla
and to test the diagnostic significance of ASL and dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) in
a model of acute kidney injury (AKI).
Material and Methods: ASL and DCE-MRI were consecutively employed on six Lewis rats, five of which had a unilateral
ischaemic AKI. All measurements in this study were performed on a 3 Tesla MR scanner using a FAIR True-FISP approach and
a TWIST sequence for ASL and DCE-MRI, respectively. Perfusion maps were calculated for both methods and the cortical
perfusion of healthy and diseased kidneys was inter- and intramethodically compared using a region-of-interest based
analysis.
Results/Significance: Both methods produce significantly different values for the healthy and the diseased kidneys
(P,0.01). The mean difference was 147647 ml/100 g/min and 141646 ml/100 g/min for ASL and DCE-MRI, respectively.
ASL measurements yielded a mean cortical perfusion of 4166124 ml/100 g/min for the healthy and 3166102 ml/100 g/
min for the diseased kidneys. The DCE-MRI values were systematically higher and the mean cortical renal blood flow (RBF)
was found to be 542685 ml/100 g/min (healthy) and 4076119 ml/100 g/min (AKI).
Conclusion: Both methods are equally able to detect abnormal perfusion in diseased (AKI) kidneys. This shows that ASL is
a capable alternative to DCE-MRI regarding the detection of abnormal renal blood flow. Regarding absolute perfusion
values, nontrivial differences and variations remain when comparing the two methods.

Introduction
Most renal and renovascular diseases like renal artery stenosis or
renal insufficiency are initially without any symptoms or pain.
Therefore, the importance of radiation free methods which allow
the assessment of renal function by measuring renal microvascular
perfusion is crucial to diagnose and to treat renal diseases already
in early stages of their progression.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) not only provides excellent
morphological information due to the different T1 and T2
relaxation times of different kidney tissues [1], but also high
enough spatial and temporal resolution for a functional analysis of
the kidneys [2]. For the assessment of renal perfusion data with
MRI, two techniques exist: Dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE)-
MRI and arterial spin labelling (ASL). DCE-MRI involves the
injection of a contrast agent, usually gadolinium (Gd) based, as
a tracer and allows to assess renal blood flow (RBF) and
glomerular filtration rate (GFR) by applying different physiological
models [3–5]. However, in the last years, cases of nephrogenic
systemic fibrosis (NSF) associated with gadolinium based contrast
agents have been reported [6]. ASL does not have this
disadvantage as it is a completely non-invasive method that uses
magnetically labelled water protons in arterial blood as an
endogenous tracer [7,8]. This way, by combining one of the three
main labelling schemes (pulsed labelling (PASL) [8–11], continu￾ous labelling (CASL) [12] or pseudo-continuous labelling (pCASL)
[13]) with an adequate imaging sequence, a perfusion sensitive
experiment can be designed. As no exogenous tracer is used, it is
a technique that can be repeatedly employed on the same patient
within short time intervals. Originally, spin labelling techniques
including selective labelling pulses [14] were only used to assess

cerebral perfusion. However, with the advent of fast imaging
sequences that are less susceptible to field inhomogeneities,
applications in the abdomen became possible. Due to their high
perfusion, the kidneys have been one of the first sites where ASL
was applied outside the brain and several studies have shown the
feasibility of quantitative renal perfusion for healthy, diseased and
transplanted kidneys [15–20].
Although there are several approaches and models [9,10,21–25]
to quantitate blood flow with ASL, there are a number of
challenges and aggravating issues, especially in the abdomen.
Problems comprise movement from respiratory-related motion
and commonly a low perfusion signal of only a few percent. Other
problematic issues concerning the quantitation are the transit
times of blood from the labelling region to the imaging slab, the
exchange time of blood from arteries into the tissue and the blood￾tissue partition coefficient. Although there exist different ap￾proaches to overcome some of the mentioned issues [20,26], the
value and the validity of ASL have to be tested. Artz et al. [27]
have validated ASL perfusion estimates in an interventional swine
model by comparing it against fluorescent microsphere measure￾ments. However, ASL also needs to be tested in diseased kidneys
and the estimates have to be compared to an alternative MR
perfusion measurement, i.e. DCE-MRI. DCE-MRI is more
commonly used in clinical routine and enjoys a higher reputation
amongst physicians compared to ASL. Meaningful ASL measure￾ments might be especially valuable in cases were the injection of
contrast agent is contraindicated, e.g. when renal diseases are
already known or when possible interactions between drugs and
contrast agent might invalidate drug studies. In particular, studies
examining the effect of drugs to treat renal diseases or to protect
transplanted kidneys [28,29] could benefit from a non-invasive
measurement with ASL.
The objective of this study was to establish ASL for renal
perfusion measurements in rats at a 3 Tesla human scanner and to
investigate and compare its significance against that of DCE-MRI.
Although, both methods used in this study have already progressed
to clinical research they are still not well established for renal
perfusion measurements and no consensus on the used imaging
strategies has been reached [30,31]. Furthermore, no renal
diseases have been examined in clinical research by using both
DCE-MRI and ASL. Therefore, an animal study performed on
a whole-body scanner has the advantage that dedicated renal
diseases can be investigated and the used methods and gained
knowledge can easily be transferred to clinical research or even
routine.
In this study, both methods were consecutively employed to
measure the renal perfusion of rats with unilateral ischaemic acute
kidney injury (AKI). We used a well-standardised warm ischaemia
model that decreases perfusion significantly [32,33] as a conse￾quence of microvascular damage and interstitial edema, resulting
in functional deterioration of the kidney [34]. With the acquired
data, maps of RBF were calculated by using a simple model based
on modified Bloch equations and a deconvolution approach,
respectively. Finally, a region of interest (ROI) based evaluation of
the perfusion maps was performed to assess and to evaluate the
estimates of renal cortical perfusion.
As perfusion measurements with contrast agents also face
challenges, e.g. the proper choice of the arterial input function
(AIF), this was not supposed to be a comparison against DCE￾MRI as a perfusion-‘gold standard’ but rather the comparison to
one commonly used alternative when measuring perfusion with
MRI. Hereby, the major focus was put on the ability to
discriminate healthy and diseased kidneys while the comparison
of absolute perfusion values is only secondary.
Materials and Methods
All measurements were performed on a 3T whole-body MR
scanner (Magnetom Tim Trio, Siemens Healthcare Sector,
Erlangen, Germany) operating at a maximum gradient strength
of 45 mT/m and a maximum slew rate of 200 T/m/s. We used
an eight channel receive-only volumetric rat array (RAPID
Biomedical GmbH, Rimpar, Germany) for signal detection. The
body coil was used for homogeneous RF transmission.
A total of six Lewis rats were examined in this study, five of
which had an ischaemic acute kidney injury (AKI). The animals
were placed supine and head first so that the kidneys were in the
RF centre of the rat array. To ensure sufficient coupling of the rat
to the body coil, the transmitter voltage was adjusted manually at
the beginning of each experiment.
Animals
Six male Lewis (LEW, RTI1) rats with a weight of 260 to 290 g
were obtained from Charles River (Sulzfeld, Germany). Animals
were kept under standard conditions. They were fed with standard
rodent chow and water ad libitum.
Ethics. All procedures were performed according to the
Guide of the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals published by
the National Academy of Sciences and were approved by the local
authorities (Regional council Karlsruhe, G40/10).
Warm ischaemia model. Acute kidney injury (AKI) is
a common clinical problem and might be caused by ischaemia￾reperfusion injury (IRI) [35]. The warm ischaemia model is a well￾standardised animal model which is used to induce IRI. For that
purpose the renal artery and renal vein are clamped for an
ischaemia time of 45 min [34]. Because of using nontraumatic
clamps, renal artery and renal vein do not show any modifications
afterwards. Ischaemia and therefore hypoxia lead to endothelial
lesion and damage of the barrier function in the kidney resulting in
interstitial edema. Furthermore, renal structures with a high
demand of oxygen like tubular epithelial cells are strongly
impaired during ischaemia showing tubulus dilatation and necrosis
[36]. Renal perfusion in AKI decreases up to 50% [33] as
a consequence of microvascular damage and interstitial edema,
resulting in functional deterioration of the kidney.
Animal preparation. Five animals were subjected to acute
kidney injury, one native rat served as control to optimise the MRI
measurements at the beginning. Before laparotomy the rats were
anaesthetized with ketamine (Ketamin 10%H, Intervet GmbH,
Unterschleißheim, Germany) and xylazine (Rompun 2%H, Bayer
Vital GmbH, Leverkusen Germany) and were heparinized
(100 IE, Heparin-Natrium ratiopharmH, Ratiopharm GmbH,
Ulm, Germany) before clamping the renal artery and the renal
vein of the left kidney for 45 min. While opening the clamps the
renal reperfusion was evaluated macroscopically. The native right
kidney served as direct control. During surgery, a hotplate (38uC)
was used to keep the animals’ body temperature in a normal
range. Postoperative, the animals were exposed to an infrared light
until they were fully awakened. All efforts were made to minimise
suffering including a unique analgesic treatment with buprenor￾phinhydrochlorid and a daily follow-up until the experiment.
MRI
The experiments were conducted five days after the induction of
the AKI to ensure a significant histologic damage. Ten minutes
prior to the MRI measurements animals were anaesthetised with
thiobutabarbital sodium (InactinH, SIGMA-Aldrich Chemie
GmbH, Steinheim, Germany) and were transported to the MR
scanner in a specific isolated transportation box. Before starting

the MRI measurements a catheter was inserted in the right vena
femoralis for the application of the contrast agent (DotaremH,
Guerbet, Roissy CdG Cedex, France) during the DCE-MRI. The
body temperature of the rats was not monitored during MRI.
Arterial spin labelling. ASL measurements were carried out
using the combination of a FAIR labelling scheme (PASL) and
a true fast imaging with steady-state precession (True-FISP)
sequence [37]. We imaged a single axial slice with a thickness of
4 mm. The slice was positioned in such a way that both left and
right kidney were imaged at the same time. Images without
magnetic preparation (M0), with global inversion (ns-IR, tag) and
with slice-selective inversion (ss-IR, control) were recorded in an
interleaved manner. Overall, 90 images were acquired resulting in
30 tag-control pairs and 30 M0 images to assess the signal
intensities. For both global and slice-selective inversion an
adiabatic hyperbolic secant pulse [38] was used which was
VERSE [39] transformed in the case of slice-selective inversion
to reduce SAR. The inflow time (inversion time) TI was 1.2 s in
both (ss-IR and ns-IR) cases. The slice thickness for the selective
inversion was 8 mm. Its slab was orientated and located so that it
covered the imaging volume completely and symmetrically. This
ensured a complete inversion of the imaging slab and strongly
decreased the risk of a displacement of the imaging slab outside the
inversion volume during the respiratory cycle. The profile quality
of the ss-IR inversion was verified in a water phantom.
Echo time (TE) for the True-FISP was 2.72 ms, repetition time
(TR) was 5.44 ms, bandwidth was 651 Hz/pixel and the flip angle
was 70u. We used a 2566256 imaging matrix and a 1406140 mm2
field of view which resulted in an in-plane resolution of
0.560.5 mm2
. The images were recorded in 0.6 s by using
a PAT acceleration factor of 3. The inter image time was 6 s to
ensure full longitudinal relaxation and an equal initial condition
for each labelling mode. To achieve a high sensitivity to perfusion
centric reordered phase-encoding was used. The image quality
was improved by using an a/2 preparation pulse and 10 dummy
pulses before the signal recording started [19]. The total
measurement time was 9 min.
For rat 2 and rat 4 four consecutive measurements were
performed to test the within subject variability.
DCE-MRI. Immediately after the ASL imaging dynamic
contrast enhanced (DCE) perfusion imaging was performed.
Therefore, we used a 3D time-resolved angiography with
stochastic trajectories (TWIST) sequence [40] with the following
parameters: TR = 3.4 ms, TE = 1.4 ms, a flip angle of 20u, field of
view 114650 mm2
, and generalised autocalibrating partially
parallel acquisition (GRAPPA) of factor 2. Matrix size was
192684628 and voxel resolution was 0.660.661.2 mm3
. TWIST
view sharing was set to 15% central region and 20% sampling
density in the outer region. The nominal temporal resolution was
0.9 s per volume. Images were continuously acquired for 6
minutes. According to a normal clinical dose and the manufac￾turer instruction about 0.05 ml of contrast agent (DotaremH,
Guerbet, Roissy CdG Cedex, France), followed by a saline flush of
1 ml, was administered manually after the 15th volume was
acquired.
Data evaluation. ASL perfusion maps were calculated by
analysing the acquired data with an in-house written MATLAB
(Version 7.10, The MathWorks, Natick, MA) script. After the
images were averaged according to their magnetic preparation (ns￾IR, ss-IR and M0) the perfusion-weighted difference image DM
between the average ss-IR and the average ns-IR image was
calculated. A registration of the images to assure a proper
collocation was not required as no in-plane motion in the
transversal images was visible and measureable. We followed the
approach of the signal equation difference between the ss-IR and
the ns-IR [9,10] and thereby, neglected transit effects. We
assumed an immediate exchange of blood protons into the tissue.
Using the calculated DM image at time TI = 1.2 s and the average
M0 image, perfusion maps (f) were then calculated on a pixel-by￾pixel basis according to the following equation [9,19]:
f ~ l
2TI
DM
M0
exp
TI
T1
  ð1Þ
Here, l is the blood-tissue water partition coefficient and was
assumed to have a constant value of 0.8 ml/g [17]. T1 is the
longitudinal relaxation time of the tissue. We used T1= 1.14 s as
proposed by de Bazelaire et al. [1]. To assess the mean perfusion
rate in the renal cortex, a region of interest (ROI) was drawn in the
perfusion maps delineating the renal cortex. For left and right
kidney of each rat, the mean cortical blood flow of all pixels inside
the ROI was estimated.
Quantification of DCE-MRI kidney perfusion was performed
using a pixel-by-pixel deconvolution approach using the following
equation:
f ~ max ½CT (t) 6{1
CA(t) ð2Þ
Here, CT(t) and CA(t) are the contrast concentrations as
a function of time in a region of interest in the tissue and inside
the artery feeding the region of interest (arterial input function),
respectively. The renal perfusion f then is the maximum value of
the tissue impuls response function, i.e. the deconvolution of the
two concentration functions. The quantification was implemented
in an in-house OsiriX plug-in [41]. The software calculates maps
of the RBF. The arterial input function was determined by
carefully placing a ROI in the abdominal aorta cranial to the
branch of the renal arteries to avoid inflow effects and to minimize
partial volume effects due to the small vessel diameter. All data
were normalised by subtracting the mean intensity of 15 baseline
volumes, and a linear relationship of the contrast agent
concentration to the measured signal intensities was assumed.
Only the volumes capturing solely the first pass were taken for
calculating the perfusion parameters, i.e. 60 volumes for animal
three and 50 volumes for all others. This way, errors caused by the
clearance of contrast agent through the medullary pyramids were
excluded.
To allow for a comparison, the ROI to assess the RBF from the
DCE perfusion maps was drawn in consensus with the ROI in the
ASL evaluation. For DCE-MRI, the mean value out of the three
slices corresponding to the ASL slice was taken.
A paired sample t-test [42] was used to make an intramethodical
comparison of the estimates of healthy and diseased kidneys as
measured with ASL and DCE-MRI, respectively. Additionally,
Bland-Altman plots [43] were drawn for both methods visualising
the difference between healthy and diseased kidneys.
Further, to test the diagnostic significance regardless of absolute
perfusion the relative perfusion of healthy and diseased kidneys,
i.e. the ratios of cortical RBF were calculated and plotted.
Results
The rats were examined without any incidents and ASL and
DCE-MRI data sets were obtained from each rat. All recorded
images showed diagnostic image quality and could be used to
calculate perfusion maps. No image distortions or artefacts

concerning the kidneys and possibly invalidating the quantitation,
were visible. In both examinations the renal cortex could be
outlined from the rest of the kidney. Figure 1 exemplarily shows
one image of an ASL and a DCE-MRI examination of one rat,
respectively. Additionally, the according RBF maps are presented.
Figure 2 shows images of one representative DCE-MRI exami￾nation at three different phases. Shortly after the bolus injection
the maximum contrast uptake in the renal cortex was reached.
Four minutes after the injection, the filtration process of the
kidneys led to equal signal intensities in cortex and medulla,
however, the signal was still increased compared to the baseline
image. The diseased kidney showed a decreased contrast uptake
and the distinction between renal cortex and medulla was less
pronounced, especially in the images after the first pass of the
contrast agent. This can also be seen in Figure 3, which shows the
time course of the signal intensities, i.e. the contrast uptake in two
cortical ROIs. One ROI was placed in the healthy kidney, one in
the diseased kidney. The decreased perfusion in the diseased
kidney is clearly reflected by the decreased contrast uptake when
compared to the healthy kidney. Generally, the diseased kidneys
were increased in size. The changes of the kidneys with acute
injury are particularly visible on histology. Figure 4 exemplarily
shows the histology of a native kidney and a kidney five days after
AKI. Compared to the native kidney the diseased kidney shows
main hallmarks of AKI like cellular swelling, necrosis (arrows) and
tubular dilatation (stars).
The results of the ASL and DCE-MRI examinations for the
cortical RBF in both left and right kidney of each rat can be found

in Table 1. We found the mean cortical RBF in the diseased
kidneys to be 3166102 ml/100 g/min (ASL) and 4076119 ml/
100 g/min (DCE-MRI). The mean cortical perfusion of the
healthy kidneys was 4166124 ml/100 g/min (ASL) and
542685 ml/100 g/min (DCE-MRI).
The paired sample t-test showed that the perfusion estimates of
healthy and diseased kidneys are significantly different for both
methods. The p-values of the t-test, i.e. the probability that the
pairwise differences of RBF between healthy and diseased kidneys
of one method are random variables from a normal distribution
with mean zero and unknown variance, were computed to 0.34%
and 0.36% when measured with ASL and DCE-MRI, re￾spectively. This difference is also reflected in the Bland-Altman
plots in Figure 5. Both plots show the systematically higher
perfusion estimates for the healthy kidneys. The fact that the
difference of zero is not included in the limits of agreement (61.96
standard deviations of the average difference) strongly supports the
ability of both methods to provide significantly different values for
healthy and diseased kidneys. For ASL the mean RBF difference
was 147647 ml/100 g/min and for DCE-MRI 141646 ml/
100 g/min. The difference in RBF between healthy kidneys and
kidneys with AKI is in very good agreement, whereas the
variations of RBF between animals are slightly higher for the
ASL estimates.
The results of the repeated ASL measurements can be found in
Table 2. The small standard deviation in the RBF of both rats
shows the small variability of the method within one subject and
provides evidence for the robustness of the measurement.
Regarding the comparison of RBF values between ASL and
DCE-MRI, both estimates for each laterality, show systematically

drawn for the data evaluation.

higher values for DCE-MRI. However, they are not significantly
different.
To compare ASL and DCE-MRI, regardless of absolute
perfusion values, the RBF ratios between diseased and healthy
kidneys are listed in Table 3 and visualised in Figure 6. Except for
rat four the values are in excellent agreement. The rats with
unilateral AKI can clearly be distinguished from the animal (rat
one) with two healthy kidneys.
Discussion
This study showed that both ASL and DCE-MRI provide
significantly (P,0.01) different values for the perfusion of healthy
kidneys and kidneys with ischaemic AKI. This shows that both
methods are capable of distinguishing the hypoperfusion of
a kidney with AKI from the perfusion of a healthy kidney. We
conclude that in future studies ASL can be sufficient to assess
pathological changes in renal function by measuring renal
perfusion. This is supported by the fact that the mean differences
of renal cortical perfusion between healthy and diseased kidneys
estimated by ASL and DCE-MRI are in very good agreement
when averaging over all rats. A paired sample t-test showed no
significant differences in the absolute estimates between the two
methods. By performing repeated measurements in two animals
we were able to show the robustness of the ASL RBF estimates.
Table 3 shows that the variabilities within one animal are very
small. This provides evidence for the validity of the results and the
assumption of an underlying normal distribution of the animal
population, despite the small sample size of only five animals with
diseased kidneys. Unfortunately, it was not possible to repeat the
DCE-MRI measurements as it would have taken too long for the
animals to wait for a sufficient clearance of the contrast agent. The
validity of the DCE-MRI estimates is however strengthened by the
constant offset to the ASL estimates regarding the absolute RBF
values (see Figure 5). However, in future studies it would be
beneficial to increase the sample size.
So far, to our knowledge, this is the first study that uses an inter￾and intramethodical comparison to test the significance and the
comparability of two perfusion MR measurements in a rat model
of AKI at a 3T whole body scanner. There are only two other
studies [44,45] that directly compare the estimates of quantified
renal perfusion from ASL and DCE-MRI. However, both Wu
et al. [45] and Winter et al. [44] solely assessed the perfusion of
healthy kidneys which did not allow for an intramethodical test of
diagnostic significance. Winter et al. measured the RBF of six
rabbits with normal kidneys using a 1.5 T scanner. The study
reports an average cortical RBF of 328659 ml/100 g/min (ASL)
and 357696 ml/100 g/min (DCE-MRI). The ASL values are
similar to our findings for the healthy kidneys (4166124 ml/
100 g/min), however RBF as estimated with contrast-enhanced
MRI is clearly lower than our findings (542685 ml/100 g/min).
Another difference to our study is that only the RBF of one,
healthy kidney per animal has been acquired so that no
comparison to the contralateral side was possible.
Wu et al. conducted a study on nineteen healthy humans and
investigated the correlation between the two modalities. Similar to
our results, they found the DCE-MRI values to be systematically
higher and not entirely comparable to the ASL estimates.
Other recently published studies, where renal perfusion was
measured in humans, state values close to our estimates. For
example, ASL measurements using a similar FAIR True-FISP

approach, report a cortical perfusion of 375654 ml/100 g/min
[16] and 376 ml/100 g/min [20]. When assessing the cortical
RBF in humans with DCE-MRI by using a model-free
deconvolution, Sourbron et al. [5] reported a value of
331670 ml/100 g/min. This comparison to human perfusion
studies is worth mentioning as the gained knowledge regarding
technical aspects of the measurements can easily be transferred to
assess renal RBF in humans.
A study that investigated the ambilateral RBF of rats with
unilateral arterial occlusion (RAS) was performed by Pedersen
et al. [46] who measured hemodynamic parameters of the kidney
by dynamic susceptibility weighted (DSC) – MRI using ultra small
superparamagnetic iron oxide (USPIO). Overall the data of 14
animals were acquired in that study and led to a mean cortical
RBF of 431 ml/100 g/min and 410 ml/100 g/min in the healthy
and RAS kidneys, respectively. Again, the RBF of the healthy
kidneys is in good agreement with our ASL measurement.

Regarding our study, both methods detect the hypoperfusion of
the injured kidney and show significantly different values for
normal kidneys compared to diseased kidneys. However, except
for one animal, the perfusion estimates in healthy and diseased
kidneys are systematically higher for DCE-MRI. This is also
reflected in the mean perfusion estimates when averaged over all
animals. It is evident that in some animals the cortical perfusion of
the diseased kidney is higher than the RBF in the healthy kidney of
other rats, even when comparing values of only one method.
Intramethodical variations are mainly attributed to different
physiological conditions of the animals. Although the AKI was
induced in the very same way each time, the rats and particularly
the kidneys can respond differently to a certain degree which leads
to a different extent of the injury. However, this can only explain
variations in the differences in RBF between healthy and diseased
kidneys. Another potential factor leading to intramethodical
variations is the different impact of the anaesthesia during MRI
on the animals and their kidney function. Especially, thiobuta￾barbital sodium can eventually alter the kidney function [47]. Also,
the ad libitum approach regarding the fluid intake prior to the
MRI experiment might result in different physiological states of
the kidneys. In future studies, going without fluids for some hours
prior to the experiment might be beneficial for consistency,
although we think that these variations are minor compared to the
ones mentioned above. Generally perfusion in small animals is
sensitive to the body temperature. Although consecutive ASL
measurements showed no changes in RBF our study is limited by
the lack of temperature monitoring as absolute perfusion values
might be influenced right after anaesthesia. However, the main
focus of this study, the intra-animal comparison, is not affected.
An aspect that can lead to intra- as well as intermethodical
variations is motion due to the respiratory cycle. This is a general
problem when measuring in the abdomen. Although, motion was
very weak in our case, it can generally lead to a blurring of the
images which can invalidate the true contrast that is essential for
the quantitation as it directly reflects the perfusion (ASL) and the
tissue contrast uptake (DCE-MRI), respectively. Both imaging
sequences acquire the central k-space lines first which assures that
the image contrast is captured very rapidly. This lowers the motion
sensitivity of both imaging sequences significantly but cannot fully
eliminate it. For DCE-MRI a further reduction might be achieved
by the usage of alternative k-space samplings like radial or BLADE
[48] or through postprocessing using image registration techniques
[49]. Unfortunately, FAIR ASL might not only be sensitive to
motion during imaging but also to motion during the inflow time,
i.e. the time between the labelling and the read-out. In such case,
the perfusion signal can be invalidated when the imaging slice is
shifted outside the ss-IR volume which leads to an overestimation
of absolute perfusion. Regarding the observed motion and the fact
that the ss-IR slice thickness was twice as thick as the imaging slice,
we consider these errors to be negligible. In contrast to this,
motion can also lead to a slice-selective inversion that labels the
aorta at a point cranial to the branch of the renal arteries. This
would result in an underestimation of RBF. Due to technical
limitations, such an erroneous labelling of the aorta can anyway
not be fully excluded and might explain the systematically lower
ASL perfusion estimates. Remedy from motion corrupted ASL
measurements can be found in respiratory triggering or navigators
[20].
Another potential source for variations and errors can be partial
volume effects. Regarding the slice thickness of the True-FISP
read-out, such effects cannot be fully excluded. However, given the
perpendicular orientation of the renal cortex with respect to the
axial imaging slices and taking into account the high in-plane

resolution, the impact on absolute quantitation should be
negligible.
Compared to ASL, DCE-MRI has the advantage that
functional parameters beyond perfusion can be extracted.
However, quantitation of DCE-MRI heavily relies on a good
selection of the AIF [50]. Slight variations can influence the
outcome of the pharmacokinetic modelling and may contribute to
inter-animal variation. Generally, it would be desirable to measure
a local AIF. While this is already challenging in humans, it is
nearly impossible in small animals. Therefore, the AIF was
measured in the aorta to exclude partial volume effects due to an
insufficient vessel size. The employed, well-standardised warm
ischaemia model mainly damages the microvascular structure of
the kidney as renal microcirculation is a key actor in the
development of AKI [32]. Nevertheless, we cannot fully exclude
errors in RBF quantification due to the dispersion of the AIF [51]
on the path to the renal cortex. However, we expect these errors to
be small and, if present, they should have no considerable effect on
the identification of the hemodynamic abnormalities in the
diseased kidney, i.e. the decreased perfusion compared to the
healthy kidney. Especially, since the warm ischaemia model is
known to decrease renal perfusion, the lower RBF will exceed
potential underestimations in absolute perfusion caused by
dispersion. This is also supported by the fact that the mean RBF
differences between healthy and diseased kidney is identical for
ASL and DCE-MRI. Furthermore, the exact vascular transit
function is unknown and a local AIF is not accessible. Hence, an
attempt to correct possible dispersion errors would very likely lead
to an erroneous correction.
Generally, DCE-MRI benefits from a high temporal and spatial
resolution as the sampling of the bolus curve is decisive and the
possibility to easily distinguish different anatomical regions should
be given. In our case, the temporal resolution is higher by a factor
of four than the constraint demanded by Michaely et al. [52] for
humans. This should sufficiently account for the faster blood
circulation in rats.
The main advantage of ASL is the fact that it is completely non￾invasive as water in arterial blood is used as an endogenous tracer
which is especially interesting for patients where the injection of
a Gd-based contrast agent is contraindicated. Therefore, it can
generally be repeated as often as necessary. Also, ASL quantitation
does not require an AIF because its signal is directly related to
perfusion. However, it suffers from low SNR as the ASL signal is
typically less than 1% of the tissue signal intensity. Hence, it is all
the more beneficial to reduce any tissue signal as it is also
a subtraction technique. Regarding this issue, our measurement
could be improved by using background suppression [26] to zero
the static tissue signal and thereby increase the relative perfusion
signal. Another critical issue of pulsed ASL sequences is the ss-IR
pulse and the quality of its inversion, regarding inversion accuracy
and the shape of the inversion slab. Although the used inversion
pulse showed a homogenous, complete inversion and an abrupt
drop at the edges when applied in a water phantom, its inversion
capabilities might be different in the abdomen due to air – tissue
transitions that cause inhomogeneities in the magnetic field. An
incomplete ss-IR can lead to increased perfusion estimates.
Regarding the quantitation of ASL, it can be beneficial to
measure a T1-map of the kidneys. This way the global T1 used for
quantitation could be substituted by a value that reflects the
longitudinal relaxation time in the according pixel itself. Especial￾ly, for the diseased kidney, T1 values of the renal cortex as found
in the literature could be differing from the actual values.
In conclusion, this study showed that ASL and DCE-MRI are
both capable of discriminating the hypoperfusion of a diseased
kidney when compared to a healthy kidney. We demonstrated that
both methods provide significantly different perfusion estimates
between healthy and diseased kidneys. This qualifies both methods
as tools to detect an acute kidney injury, as both provide the
necessary sensitivity to detect the hypoperfusion caused by the
ischaemic AKI. Absolute quantitation of cortical RBF in rats is not
significantly different but DCE-MRI estimates are systematically
higher. Nevertheless, it was shown that even when both methods
differ in absolute RBF values, relative perfusion between left and
right kidney can still indicate kidney diseases that are reflected in
abnormal perfusion. For the diagnosis of renal diseases, this is the
crucial requirement a method has to fulfil.
Microvascular perfusion of the renal cortex is an important
parameter of high clinical value as it allows for directly drawing
conclusions on the organ viability and function. Regarding the
diagnostic significance, this study showed that ASL is a capable
alternative to DCE-MRI, leaving it open to physicians to choose
between two comparable methods. Especially for patients with
impaired kidney function where the injection of Gd-based contrast
agents may be contraindicated or for studies that involve drugs
and diseased kidneys, ASL might be favoured. Nevertheless,
regarding absolute perfusion values, nontrivial differences and
variations remain when comparing the two methods, which
indicate that further investigation and the comparison to
a reference standard is needed.
