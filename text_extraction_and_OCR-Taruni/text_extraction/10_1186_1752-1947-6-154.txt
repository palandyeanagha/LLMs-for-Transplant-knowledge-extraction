Abstract
Introduction: We report an instructive case of incidental renal cell carcinoma in a patient with autosomal dominant
polycystic kidney disease who underwent simultaneous bilateral native nephrectomy and living donor renal
transplantation.
Case presentation: A 57-year-old Asian man with end-stage kidney disease due to autosomal dominant polycystic
kidney disease received a living kidney graft from his brother. Because of recurrent infection, chronic pain and
enlarged kidneys, he underwent a bilateral nephrectomy with concomitant renal transplantation. The total weight
of the removed kidneys was 6kg; the maximal diameter of the larger kidney was 28cm. His left kidney had a 1cm
diameter tumor. Pathology indicated papillary renal cell carcinoma. At the time of this report, the transplant kidney
function was normal with no evidence of local recurrence or distant metastasis.
Conclusion: This case shows and reinforces the importance of considering the possibility of an occult malignancy
in the native kidneys of patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. Simultaneous bilateral native
nephrectomy should be considered in these renal transplant recipients not only for preventing the development of
adverse symptoms but also for detecting an occult malignancy.
Introduction
Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD)
is one of the best-known genetic diseases. Almost half of
patients with ADPKD will develop end-stage renal disease
(ESRD) by the age of 60 [1]. According to a survey by the
Japanese Society for Dialysis Therapy, approximately 3% of
dialysis patients have ADPKD. The clinical course of
ADPKD typically includes refractory abdominal discom￾fort and flank pain caused by renal enlargement, experi￾enced by approximately 60% of patients [2]. The kidneys
of patients with ADPKD usually continue to increase in
size even after patients begin dialysis, and mass effects can
lead to severe complications including recurrent cyst
infections and urinary tract infections, severe hyperten￾sion, bleeding into the cysts, and intractable pain. At the
time of transplantation, these nonfunctional kidneys are
massively enlarged [3]. Therefore, pretransplant native
nephrectomy is performed to create space in the pelvis, to
decrease compression by the enlarged polycystic kidney,
and to prevent development of various symptoms. In re￾cent years, transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) of the
renal artery has been reported as a renal contraction ther￾apy for ADPKD; however, the effects of this therapeutic
method remain controversial.
Here, we present a case of incidental renal cell carcin￾oma (RCC) in a patient with ADPKD who underwent sim￾ultaneous bilateral native nephrectomy and living donor
renal transplantation. This case is instructive in that the
simultaneous bilateral native nephrectomy offered an op￾portunity to detect an occult malignancy in the resected
native kidney of a renal transplant patient with ADPKD.
Case presentation
A 57-year-old Asian man had ESRD due to ADPKD. At
the time of referral, he had undergone peritoneal dialysis
for 7 years. Although he had recurrent cystic infection

and chronic pain, his urine volume was maintained at
about 300mL/day. A physical examination showed two
obvious masses in his abdomen extending from his rib
cage into his pelvis. Laboratory results were within nor￾mal ranges except for carcinoembryonic antigen (13.4ng/mL;
normal range <5ng/mL) and carbohydrate antigen 19-9
(1,736U/mL; normal range <37U/mL). Computed tomog￾raphy (CT) showed innumerable cysts of variable size in both
kidneys and his liver (Figure 1A,B). Positron emission
tomography-CT did not show increased uptake in
either kidneys or in his other organs, and an endo￾scopic examination demonstrated the absence of
tumors.
Because of the recurrent infection, chronic pain and
enlarged kidneys, our patient underwent a bilateral neph￾rectomy with concomitant living donor renal transplant￾ation. He received a renal graft from his brother (ABO
blood group compatible, human leukocyte antigen full
match, T-cell flow cytometry crossmatch assay negative).
A bilateral nephrectomy was performed through an ab￾dominal midline incision, and the renal allograft was
placed in the right iliac fossa through a modified Gibson
incision. The renal graft was positioned in his retroperito￾neum to prevent renal pedicle torsion. The operative time
was 533 minutes, including bilateral nephrectomy, re￾moval of the continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis
catheter, and the renal transplantation. The estimated
blood loss was 2,240mL (including urine from the renal
allograft and ascites). He had no surgical complications.
The total removed kidney weight was 6kg (8.5% of his
total body weight) (Figure 2A) and the maximal diameter
of his larger left kidney was 28cm. There was a tumor in
his left kidney, 1cm in diameter (Figure 2B).
The final pathological diagnosis was a type 2 papil￾lary RCC, eosinophilic variant, pT1a (Figure 2C,D).
The quadruple immunosuppression induction protocol
comprised cyclosporine, mycophenolate mofetil, basi￾liximab and methylprednisolone. He showed an imme￾diate improvement in renal function. His creatinine
level decreased gradually and reached 0.59mg/dL on
post-transplantation day 28. His postoperative recov￾ery was uneventful, and our patient received regular
follow-up care at our outpatient clinic. At the time of
this report, the transplanted kidney function was nor￾mal with no evidence of local recurrence or distant
metastasis.
Discussion
Generally accepted indications for nephrectomy in
ADPKD cases are recurrent pyelonephritis, cyst
hemorrhage requiring repeat transfusions, pain refrac￾tory to medical management, and massively enlarged
kidneys that cause early satiety or extend into the true
pelvis [4]. An enlarged polycystic kidney can cause
mechanical compression of the transplanted kidney
and ureter with consequent disturbance of urine flow
and vascular disorders [5]. Furthermore, there may be
technical difficulties during transplantation.
Traditionally, operations concurrent with transplant
recipient surgery have been avoided due to concerns that
a complication of the additional surgery could endanger
the transplant and that high dose induction immunosup￾pression could increase the complication risk of extra
surgery. However, previous studies have demonstrated
that pretransplant nephrectomy in patients with ADPKD
results in an increased risk of perioperative morbidity,
such as fluid overload, congestive heart failure, hyperka￾lemia, anemia, and renal osteodystrophy [6]. Staging
nephrectomy and transplantation also requires an add￾itional operation with anesthetic exposure and associated
hospitalization. Recent studies show that concurrent
nephrectomy with renal transplantation does not in￾crease mortality or morbidity [7-9].
Approaches to ADPKD have included unilateral and
bilateral native nephrectomy. Possible advantages of uni￾lateral nephrectomy are the ability to avoid violating the
peritoneum as well as a likely shorter operative time and
decreased blood loss [4]. However, pyelonephritis asso￾ciated with ADPKD can produce fatal sepsis in immuno￾suppressed patients. Bilateral nephrectomy, not unilateral
nephrectomy, eliminates this risk in patients with recur￾rent infections. Bilateral nephrectomy also eliminates cyst
hemorrhage and decreases the chronic pain associated
with ADPKD that produces considerable patient morbid￾ity. In our case, our patient had undergone peritoneal dia￾lysis and his urine volume had been maintained, although
he also suffered from recurrent cystic infection and
chronic pain. Therefore, we performed simultaneous renal
transplantation and bilateral nephrectomy because a
hemodialysis bridge was unnecessary and the process
eliminated the risk of recurrent infections.
Particular attention should be paid to exclude the pres￾ence of solid or cystic tumors within the kidneys or other
abdominal organs. RCC is present in ADPKD at the same
frequency as in the general population [10]. Recently, inci￾dental detection of RCC has been increasing due to the de￾velopment and expanded use of improved CT and
ultrasound in hospitals [11]. Nevertheless, the preoperative
diagnosis of small RCC in ADPKD is difficult because the
tumor may be masked by the complex cystic background
superimposed by bleeding, degenerated blood clots, pro￾teinaceous debris, and infection, in addition to renal failure
preventing intravenous contrast injection in many cases.
Patients who have been successfully treated for pre￾transplant malignancy are deemed suitable candidates
for transplant. However, the precise waiting period
should be determined on an individual basis by tumor
type, staging, and response to therapy. Previous

studies revealed that organ-confined RCCs, especially
those <4cm in diameter (pT1a), could be completely
cured by partial or radical nephrectomy but more
enlarged RCCs (>7cm, T2) require an adequate disease￾free waiting period after surgery [12,13]. Tumors >4cm
in diameter can be detected with preoperative CT or
ultrasound even if they exist in a background of ADPKD.
Therefore, we believed that staging nephrectomy and
transplantation may be suggested when RCC is suspected
in patients with ADPKD. However, patients with ADPKD
preoperatively diagnosed as having no malignancy might
still have an occult malignancy in the native kidneys.
Thus, simultaneous bilateral native nephrectomy could
offer an advantageous opportunity to detect an occult
malignancy in the resected native kidneys on histological
study.

Recently, TAE of the renal artery has been reported as
an effective and less invasive renal contraction therapy
for ADPKD. The volume reduction obtained after TAE
has reached 60% after 6 months [14]. Thus, TAE of
enlarged polycystic kidneys has been proposed as an
alternative to nephrectomy before renal transplantation.
However, several problems must be addressed before the
procedure is performed. Cornelis et al. reported that if
kidney volume is excessive (>5000cm3
), TAE must be
considered carefully because of the high risk of an insuf￾ficient reduction in volume [15]. In our case, his baseline
kidney volumes were calculated using the ellipsoid for￾mula from the three greatest diameters (volume =
length × depth × width × 0.5233) on unenhanced CT ac￾quisition. His baseline right kidney volume was 5,364cm3
and his left was 5,387cm3
. Furthermore, renal TAE ther￾apy alone cannot cure a malignant renal tumor, because
the capillary and small artery networks are well￾developed in ADPKD [14]. Thus, delayed detection and
treatment of RCC in ADPKD might be avoided if this
therapeutic method were employed for the treatment of
ADPKD in kidney transplant candidates.
Conclusion
We present an instructive case of incidental RCC in a
patient with ADPKD who underwent simultaneous bilat￾eral native nephrectomy and living donor renal transplant￾ation. This case shows and reinforces the importance of
considering the possibility of an occult malignancy in the
native kidneys of patients with ADPKD. Simultaneous bi￾lateral native nephrectomy should be considered in these
renal transplant recipients not only for preventing the
development of adverse symptoms but also for detecting
an occult malignancy.
