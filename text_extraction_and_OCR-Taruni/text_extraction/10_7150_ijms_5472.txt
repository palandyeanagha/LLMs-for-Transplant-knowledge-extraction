Abstract
Objective: To analyze the efficacy and safety of entecavir (ETV) treatment for up to 5 years in 
nucleos(t)ide-naïve chronic hepatitis B patients in real life. 
Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 230 nucleos(t)ide naïve chronic hepatitis B patients who
received ETV 0.5 mg/day monotherapy for at least 3 months, of whom 113 were HBeAg positive 
and 117 were HBeAg negative. The primary endpoints was cumulative probability of achieving a 
virological response (undetectable serum HBV DNA, <100IU/mL). Secondary endpoints were 
rates of ALT normalization (ALT < upper limit of normal), HBeAg seroconversion, resistance, and
safety.
Results: The median follow-up duration was 27.5 months (3-73 months) and mean age was 42
years. With 230, 214, 180, 142, 88, 42 and 11 patients followed-up for at least 3 months,6 months, 
1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 years, respectively. In all, Incremental increases were observed in the rates of 
undetectable HBV DNA. 67.0%, 85.0%, 89.4%, 94.4%, 95.5%, 97.6%, 100% had undetectable HBV 
DNA at month 3, month 6, 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, 4 years and 5 years. Proportions of patients 
achieving normal ALT were 73.9%, 85.5%, 82.8%, 89.4%, 80.7%, 85.7%, 100%, respectively. The
rate of HBeAg seroconversion reached 21.4% and 15.4% at year2, 3, respectively. One patient 
achieved HBsAg seroclearance after 1 year, and achieved anti-HBs seroconversion at year 3. Of 
180 patients, HBV DNA was detectable (partial virological response, PVR) in 19 patients at year 1 
of follow-up, twelve of 14 (85.7%) patients with PVR need more than 1 year of continuous ETV 
therapy to achieved VR. At baseline, no ETV-resistance was detected in 25 ETV-naïve patients. 
One patient developed ETV-resistance mutations due to noncompliance. No serious adverse 
event was reported.
Conclusion: Long-term ETV treatment of nucleos(t)ide-naïve was effective and safe in real life. 
Adjustment of ETV monotherapy in nucleos(t)ide-naïve patients with a partial virological response 
at 1 year may be unnecessary.

Introduction
As stated in the Asian-Pacific consensus state￾ment on the management of chronic hepatitis B, the 
goal of therapy for hepatitis B is to suppress HBV 
replication in a sustained manner and prevent pro￾Ivyspring

gression of the disease to cirrhosis, decompensated 
cirrhosis, end-stage liver disease, HCC, and its com￾plications, aiming to improve the quality of life and 
survival. Antiviral therapy is critical to reduce the
HBV DNA to a level as low as possible [1].
Entecavir (ETV) is a cyclopentyl guanosine ana￾logue and a potent and selective inhibitor of HBV 
replication in vitro. The rates of histologic improve￾ment, virologic response, and normalization of ala￾nine aminotransferase (ALT) levels were significantly 
higher with ETV than with lamivudine (LAM) and 
adefovir dipivoxil (ADV) [2,3]. Chang et al compared 
the efficiency of ETV and LAM in patients with 
HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B in a multi-center, 
random, double-blind trial. More patients in the 
entecavir group than in the LAM group had unde￾tectable serum HBV DNA levels (67% vs. 36%, 
p<0.001) and normalization of ALT levels (68% vs. 60 
%, p=0.02) at 48 weeks [2].The results of up to 2 years 
of ETV vs LAM therapy in nucleoside-naïve 
HBeAg-positive patients with chronic hepatitis B 
shows that 156 (64%) had serum HBV DNA <300 
copies/mL at week 48, increasing to 180 (74%) at end 
of dosing. In year 2, 161 (66%) of patients treated with 
ETV had ALT normalization at 48 weeks, and at the 
end of dosing in year 2, this number had increased to 
183 (79%) [4]. Chang et al presented the results after 
up to 5 years (240 weeks) of continuous entecavir 
therapy. At year 5, 94% (88/94) had HBV DNA <300 
copies/mL and 80% (78/98) had normal ALT levels. 
In addition to patients who achieved serologic re￾sponses during study ETV-022, 23% (33/141) 
achieved HBeAg seroconversion and 1.4% (2/145) lost 
HBsAg [5]. After 96weeks in ETV-060 (120-148 weeks 
total ETV treatment time), 88% (127/144) of patients 
had HBV DNA <400 copies/mL. The 3-year cumula￾tive probability of resistance was 1.2% for the 0.5 mg 
subset [6]. The above results indicate that ETV treat￾ment for nucleoside-naïve patients resulted in high 
rates of virological, biochemical, and histological re￾sponse, with minimal resistance.
Nucleos(t)ide analogues (NAs), including ETV
and tenofovir (TDF), are potent HBV inhibitors and 
they have a high barrier to resistance. Thus they can 
be confidently used as first-line monotherapies.
However, there are increasing number of patients 
who experienced treatment failure to different NA 
treatment regimens. They discontinued therapy or 
change treatment plan because of inadequate re￾sponse, noncompliance, or financial barriers, which 
poses a growing problem in daily clinical practice. 
Compared to strictly-controlled clinical trials, how￾ever, efficacy and safety of ETV is often difficult to 
assess due to poor patient compliance and adherence 
in real-life. That is why we meant to conduct this re￾search in order to provide objective real-life data for 
clinical use of ETV. In addition, early detection of pa￾tients with partial virological response (PVR) and
appropriate intervention for achieving sustained viral 
suppression have been emphasised. It has been 
clearly demonstrated that patients who show PVR to 
LAM or telbivudine (LdT) are at high risk for devel￾oping resistance to antiviral therapy [7-8]. However, 
ten to 33% of patients on ETV monotherapy for 48 
weeks showed a PVR [9]. It is thus unclear whether 
treatment adaptation is necessary for naive patients 
treated with the more potent drug ETV in real life. 
Therefore, the aims of this retrospective study were to 
(1) evaluate the long-term efficiency of ETV treatment 
in NA-naïve chronic hepatitis B patients in real life, (2) 
assess the efficacy of continuous ETV therapy in some 
ETV -naïve patients who failed to achieve virological 
response at 1 year.
Patients and methods
Study population
This retrospective study collected consecutive 
patients from the Department of Infectious Diseases, 
The Third Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University 
between June 2006 and September 2012. All chronic 
hepatitis B patients were diagnosed with the
Guideline of Prevention and Treatment for Chronic 
Hepatitis B (2010 Version)[10] and were treated with 
ETV 0.5 mg/day monotherapy. Further eligibility 
criteria were: age 18-65; have detectable HBsAg for 6
Months; HBV DNA>2000IU/mL; ALT>2 upper limit 
of normal (ULN); duration of ETV monotherapy for at 
least 3 months. Patients were excluded from studies if 
they had HIV and other hepatitis viruses infections, or 
evidence of liver decompensation (alcoholic Hepatitis, 
autoimmune hepatitis, and drug-induced liver dis￾ease). Pregnant and nursing women were also ex￾cluded. The study protocol conformed to the ethical 
guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki and was ap￾proved by the Third Affiliated Hospital Ethical 
Committee. Informed consent was obtained from each 
patient enrolled in the study. Among 246 patients 
treated with ETV 0.5 mg/day, 16 were excluded be￾cause of duration of ETV monotherapy less than 3 
months (n=13), incomplete data at base line (n=3). A
total of 230 patients were eligible for this analysis.
Study design
Subjects received entecavir 0.5 mg/day (Bris￾tol-Myers Squibb, Shanghai) monotherapy. Routine

DNA, and serologic analysis, hepatic synthetic func-

tion, creatine kinase, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, 
blood lactate were assayed at base line and every 3-6 
months thereafter. A 2 mL blood sample was collected 
at each follow-up for future assessment. Genotypic 
resistance was also assessed (1) in all HBV patients 
who had PVR; or (2) at baseline in 25 ETV-naïve HBV 
voluntary patients. The diagnosis of cirrhosis was 
based on histology or ultrasound examinations. The 
patients were carefully examined at each follow-up 
visit and asked to report any incidence of adverse 
events. 
Endpoints
Primary endpoint was the proportions of pa￾tients achieving virological response (undetectable 
HBV DNA<100 IU/mL) at month 3, month 6, 1 year, 2 
years, 3 years, 4 years and 5 years. Secondary end￾points were HBeAg loss and seroconversion, ALT 
normalization, and genotypic resistance testing. Par￾tial virological response was defined as a decrease in 
HBV DNA of more than 2.0 log10 IU/mL but detect￾able HBV DNA by real-time PCR assay (100 IU/mL) 
at 48 weeks of ETV treatment [11].
Assay methods
Liver function and other biochemical indexes
assays were measured using automated techniques. 
Serum HBV DNA levels were measured using a 
quantitative real-time PCR assay (DAAN Gene Co., 
Ltd., Guangzhou, China), with a lower limit of detec￾tion of 100 IU/mL. HBsAg, anti-HBs, HBeAg, and 
anti-HBe were measured using commercially availa￾ble chemiluminescence assay kits (Roche Diagnostic 
Systems). Detection of HBV polymerase gene muta￾tions was determined by direct sequencing PCR 
method (BGI-Shenzhen, Shenzhen, China).
Statistical analysis
Data were analyzed using the SPSS software 
package version 13.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). 
Quantitative data were presented as the mean ±
standard deviation (SD). Categorical data were pre￾sented as counts and percentages. HBV DNA levels 
were presented as log transformation. Student’s t test 
was used for quantitative data. Pearson chi-square 
and Fisher exact tests were used for categorical varia￾bles. Logistic regression analysis was used to investi￾gate the factors were associated with PVR to ETV 
monotherapy. A two-tailed p value <0.05 was con￾sidered statistically significant.
Results
Subject disposition
Baseline characteristics of the study population 
are presented in Table 1. In total, 230 patients were 
treated with ETV 0.5 mg/day, of whom 113 were 
HBeAg-positive and 117 were HBeAg-negative.
Overall, 85.2% (n=196) were male, 141 (61.3%) had 
family history of HBV infection, 74 (32.2%) patients 
had cirrhosis. Mean HBV DNA was 6.3 log10IU/mL. 
Mean age was 42 years and Median follow-up of the 
whole study population was 28(3-73) months. Among 
230 NA-naïve CHB patients in our current study, 28 
experienced interferon therapy. 25 patients were 
male, the mean age was 39 years, and the mean body 
mass index was 25.8. Mean HBV DNA was 6.7 
log10IU/mL, 13 patients was HBeAg positive. 6 cases 
were treated pegylated interferon, 22 cases were 
treated conventional interferon. Fourteen patients 
were on treatment less than 1 month because of the 
high cost and poor compliance. Nine had been treated 
for 1 year and then were terminated therapy after 
achieving vriologic response. All these 9 patients fi￾nally developed virologic rebound at 2 years after 
cessation of interferon therapy. Another 5 patients 
failed to achieve response after 6 months-treatment 
and switched to ETV.

73.9%, 85.5%, 82.8%, 89.4%, 80.7%, 85.7% and 100% 
(Fig. 2). Among the 113 HBeAg-positive patients at 
baseline, 80.5% (n=91) were male, with a median fol￾low-up of 23 (3-65) months. Mean HBV DNA was 
6.7log10IU/mL (Table 1). The cumulative probability 
of achieving virological response at 3 months, 6 
months, 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, 4 years, and 5 years
was 60.2%, 76.7%, 85.2%, 89.9%, 92.9%, 92.3% and

2, 3, and 4 years was 15.9%, 21.7%, 21.4%, 15.4%, re￾spectively (Fig. 3). One patient achieved HBsAg sero￾clearance after 1 year, and achieved anti-HBs sero￾conversion at year 3. In 117 HBeAg-negative patients 
at baseline, those who achieved virological response
at 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, 4 years,
and 5 years was 73.5%, 92.8%, 93.5%, 98.6%, 97.8%

Partial virological response in NA-naïve pa￾tients
Baseline demographics and disease characteris￾tics of patients who gained PVR after 1 year were 
summarized in Table 2. Nineteen (19/180, 10.6%) pa￾tients achieved PVR after 1 year of treatment. The 
univariate and multivariate Logistic regression model 
were applied for high risk factors analysis for having 
a PVR. High baseline HBVDNA levels (OR,0.532; 
95%CI,0.315-0.896; P=0.018) and virological 
non-response at week 24 (OR,6.093; 
95%CI,2.099-17.685; P=0.001) to ETV monotherapy 
were the independent risk factors for a PVR at 1 year
(Table 3). Twelve of 14 (85.7%) patients with PVR 
need more than 1 year of continuous ETV therapy to 
achieved VR (Table 2). Among the remained 5 pa￾tients, 3 patients were switched to ETV+ ADV com￾bination therapy (One of these three patients devel￾oped ETV resistance due to noncompliance). 12 pa￾tients were followed up to 3 years, and 100% (12/12) 
achieved virological response. Four patients achieved 
virological response during follow up to year 4.
Resistance
Twenty-five ETV-naïve patients had genotypic 
resistance testing at baseline. One showed ADV re￾sistance (rtN236T). No mutation associated with re￾sistance to LAM or ETV was revealed.
19 of ETV-naïve patients with PVR at 1 year had 
genotypic resistance detection. Among them, Only 
one patient developed ETV resistance (rtL180M + 
rtT184A + rtM204V) after ETV treatment for 1 year. 
Subsequently, it was switched to ETV+ADV combi￾nation therapy.
Safety
No severe adverse event was reported during 
the study. During follow-up, Transient elevations of 
creatine kinase were detected among 31 patients. 
They all had no muscle aches. In questioning history, 
these patients had a certain amount of exercise (such 
as playing basketball, climbing, and running). After 
reducing the amount of exercise, creatine kinase was 
restored to normal. None of the patients developed 
clinically evident elevated blood lactate (normal range 
0.5-1.7mmol/L). To assess renal safety, we analyzed 
creatinine levels in a subset of 147 patients with an 
available baseline creatinine level. Sustained slightly 
elevated creatinine was observed in one patient who 
had been gone through hepatectomy. Eighteen pa￾tients developed hepatocellular carcinoma, of whom 
15 was already present at the start of ETV treatment 
and 3 (who had a history of cirrhosis) were diagnosed 
during ETV treatment.

Discussion
Compared with other available nucleos(t)ide 
analogs, ETV achieves more potent HBV DNA sup￾pression than all agents except perhaps TDF, which is
equivalent [12]. Our previous study [13] has shown 
that ETV had better rate of virologic response, lower 
incidence of resistance, commensurable safety as well 
as seroconversion rate when compared to LAM, ADV, 
LdT. In the registration trials of ETV, rates of geno￾typic resistance were rare in both HBeAg-positive and 
HBeAg-negative patients. Because of potent viral 
suppression and a large genetic barrier to resistance, 
ETV is recommended as a first-line choice in HBV 
treatment guidelines.
This present results show that a gradual increase 
of the cumulative virological response rate in 
ETV-naïve patients at all time points through treat￾ment for up to 5 years in real life. More than 90% pa￾tients had HBV DNA undetectable after 2 years. There 
was obvious serum HBV DNA reduction and in￾creased virological response at 12 weeks and 24 
weeks, which confirms ETV to be a highly potent an￾tiviral agent. The rate of ALT normalization was in￾creased over time too. Rate of HBeAg seroconversion 
at 2 years and 3 years were 21.7% and 21.4%, which 
are consistent with previous results [14-17]. All in￾cluded patients in this study were NA-naïve, 
28(12.2%) of which had experience of interferon. Since 
the antiviral and immunoregulatory effects of inter￾feron, it has been approved for first-line treatment 
option of CHB. However, it is still unsure how pre￾vious interferon exposure affects the efficacy of ETV 
therapy. But in this study, the proportion of interferon
-experienced cases was not high. Their duration of 
treatment was mostly less than 1 month, or at least 2 
years away from the start of ETV therapy. Thus, the 
impact of interferon to ETV therapy may be limited.
In this study, a small number of ETV-naïve pa￾tients (19/180) achieved PVR after 1 year of ETV
treatment, similar with that of previous results 
(10%-30%) [9]. The present study investigated several 
baseline and viral factors that may influence the anti￾viral efficacy [18-19]. We further analyzed the high 
risk factors of patients with PVR by applying the
univariate and multivariate Logistic regression mod￾el. It is stated that VR of ETV-naïve patients at year 1 
was significantly affected by baseline HBV DNA lev￾el, VR at month 6, while gender, age, BMI, hepatitis B 
family history, baseline ALT level, VR at month 3 
were irrelevant to VR at week 48. In other words, it 
was easier to achieve VR at year 1 in patients with 
lower baseline HBV DNA level and in those who 
achieved VR at month 6. Therefore, it was recom￾mended that ETV-naïve patients with PVR should be 
managed differently according to treatment response 
and baseline HBV DNA level, if they are compliant 
[20]. Marcellin et al [21] suggested that the character￾istics of the patients and virus were important when 
assessing the chance of success and when choosing 
the best therapeutic strategy. In a word, more and 
more data needed to allow a more personalized ap￾proach for optimizing treatment in individual pa￾tients. 
The clinical relevance of NAs PVR relates to the 
high risk these patients face of developing resistance 
to long-term anti-HBV treatment, particularly when 
LAM and LdT are involved [22]. Treatment adapta￾tion is suggested in the roadmap for management of 
patients with PVR receiving oral therapy for chronic 
hepatitis B proposed by Keeffe et al [23-24]. But ETV is
a large genetic barrier to resistance drug, Long-term 
monitoring showed low rates of resistance in nucleo￾side-naïve patients during 5 years of ETV therapy. 
Thus, this strategy for patients with PVR may be dif￾ferent from LAM and LdT. It was reported that ETV 
monotherapy can be continued in NA-naïve patients 
with detectable HBV DNA at week 48, particularly in 
those with a low viral load, because long-term ETV 
leads to a virological response in the vast majority of 
patients [18]. We continued ETV therapy in 19 pa￾tients with detectable HBV DNA at year 1. Virological 
response was achieved in 85.7% (12/14), 100%(12/12), 
100%(4/4) of NA-naïve patients at 2 years, 3 years, 
and 4 years, respectively. Most of the patients can 
finally achieve virological response if therapy is con￾tinued beyond 1 year. On the other hand, a sustained 
low viremia were found in patients with PVR to 
48-week ETV monotherapy. In addition, ETV re￾sistance is unique because it requires up to three mu￾tations for full resistance to develop [25]. In this study, 
only one patient with PVR developed ETV resistance
(rtL180M + rtT184A + rtM204V) after ETV treatment 
for 1 year. The reason is this patient did not take 
medicine following the doctor,
s medical advice. Thus, 
it was suggested that adjustment of ETV monothera￾py in NA-naïve patients with a PVR at 1 year may be 
unnecessary in real life. Whether this kind of therapy 
would increase risk of resistance in longer time or not 
is undefined, which need further study. 
HBV has quasispecies characteristics and can 
have various mutations before NAs treatment, possi￾bly responsible for pre-existing resistance [26-27]. 
Though the occurrence of pre-existing resistance is 
rare, it has been found to eliminate the antiviral effi￾cacy of LAM therapy [28]. But for ADV, its primary 
non-response was considered irrelevant to 
pre-existing resistance [29]. In this study, we had not

detected pre-existing resistance in all ETV-naïve pa￾tients because of the high cost. Genotypic resistance at 
baseline was tested in 25 ETV-naïve voluntary pa￾tients and no mutation associated with resistance to 
ETV was revealed. ETV has rare occurrence of re￾sistance in NA-naive patients [30]. Considering 
cost-effectiveness, detecting mutations for 
pre-existing resistance to ETV in NA-naive patients is 
of limited significance. In contrast, a reduced barrier 
to resistance was observed in LAM-refractory pa￾tients, resulting in a 5-year cumulative probability of 
genotypic ETV-resistance of 51% [30]. It’s reported
that prior ADV-experience or even presence of 
ADV-resistance did not influence antiviral response to 
ETV. Presence of LAM-resistant mutations at the start 
of ETV monotherapy was significantly associated 
with a reduced probability of achieving virological 
response [31]. Therefore, Genotypic resistance testing
before initiating ETV treatment is not necessary for 
NA-naive patients, but necessary for 
LAM-experienced patients regardless with 
LAM-resistance or not.
In conclusion, long-term treatment of ETV 0.5
mg/day for up to 5 years suppressed HBV-DNA to 
undetectable levels in more than 90% of ETV-naïve 
chronic hepatitis B patients. Adjustment of ETV 
monotherapy in NA-naive patients with a PVR at 1 
year may be not needed, if ETV resistance did not 
happen. Most patients could achieve virological re￾sponse if therapy was continued beyond 1 year.
Moreover, it was also a very safe antiviral agent.
