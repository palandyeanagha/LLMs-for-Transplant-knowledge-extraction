Long-term exposure to ethanol simultaneously causes gastrointestinal inflammation, liver injury, and stea￾tosis. In the present study, we investigated the effects of Bifidobacterium longum LC67, Lactobacillus
plantarum LC27, and their mixture (LM) against ethanol-induced steatosis in mice. Exposure to ethanol
caused liver damage: it increased ALT, AST, TG, TC, and lipopolysaccharide levels in the blood and
induced NF-κB activation in the liver. Oral administration of LC27, LC67, or LM in mice reduced ethanol￾induced ALT, AST, TG, and TC levels in the blood and liver. These also suppressed ethanol-induced NF-κB
activation and α-smooth muscle actin expression in the liver and increased ethanol-suppressed AMPK
activation. Treatment with LC27, LC67, or LM increased ethanol-suppressed alcohol dehydrogenase and
acetaldehyde dehydrogenase activities in the liver, as well as tight junction protein expression in the liver
and colon. Moreover, treatment with LC27, LC67, or LM restored the ethanol-disturbed gut microbiota
composition, such as the increased population of Proteobacteria, and inhibited fecal and blood lipopoly￾saccharide levels. These inhibited NF-κB activation and increased tight junction protein expression in
ethanol- or lipopolysaccharide-stimulated Caco-2 cells. These findings suggest that LC27, LC67, and LM
can alleviate alcoholic steatosis by inhibiting LPS-mediated NF-κB activation through restoration of the
disturbed gut microbiota.
1. Introduction
Exposure to ethanol remains a main risk factor in chronic liver
disease.1 Alcoholic liver damage, ranging from simple hepatic
steatosis to serious liver damage such as fibrosis and cirrhosis,
results from chronic ethanol abuse or binge drinking.2
Chronic exposure to ethanol increases oxidative stress, endo￾toxin, and inflammatory cytokines in the blood and liver and
disturbs the gut microbiota composition and gut membrane
function, leading to liver damage including liver steatosis,
fibrosis, and cirrhosis.3,4 Ethanol is metabolized to acetate via
acetaldehyde and produces reactive oxygen species, which
stimulates inflammation.5–7 Moreover, the intake of ethanol
disturbs the gut microbiota composition and increases bac￾terial endotoxin production.8–10 Excessive exposure to endotox￾ins can cause inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract (e.g.,
colitis), and disruption in gut wall functions; this further accel￾erates the absorption of intestinal bacterial by-products,
including endotoxins, into the blood.10,11 Excessive absorption
of endotoxins such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) into the blood
causes inflammation in the liver, and deteriorates non-alco￾holic and alcoholic liver diseases including steatosis, hepatitis,
and hepatic fibrosis.10,12,13
Lactic acid bacteria are frequently used in reducing the
disease risks and increasing the quality of life of patients.14,15
Of these, lactobacilli and bifidobacteria suppress the pro￾liferation of pathogens,16 increase the immune function of
the host,17 attenuate metabolic diseases,18,19 and alleviate
alcohol-induced liver damage.8,20,21 Lactobacillus rhamnosus
CCFM1107 attenuates liver injury in ethanol-treated mice by
reducing oxidative stress and restoring intestinal microflora.20
Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG alleviated liver injury in ethanol￾treated mice by increasing miR122a expression.22 Lactobacillus

brevis SBC8803 attenuates liver damage in ethanol-treated
mice by inhibiting proinflammatory cytokine expression.23
Bifidobacterium longum LC67 and Lactobacillus plantarum LC27
attenuated acute ethanol-induced gastritis and liver injury in
mice by inhibiting NF-κB activation and IL-8 expression.21
Some lactic acid bacteria including Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG
attenuate ethanol-induced steatosis.24 However, the inhibitory
mechanisms of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli including LC27
and LC67 against ethanol-induced steatosis have remained
elusive.
Therefore, we examined the effects of LC27 and LC67,
which inhibited NF-κB activation and TNF-α expression in
ethanol-stimulated Kupffer cells and LPS-stimulated macro￾phages,21 against alcoholic steatosis in mice.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Materials
RPMI1640 and LPS purified from Escherichia coli O111:B4 were
purchased from Sigma (St Louis, MO, USA). Antibodies were
purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA, USA).
Radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) lysis buffer, phospha￾tase inhibitor cocktail, and protease inhibitor cocktail were
purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA, USA). Enzyme￾linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits for cytokines were
purchased from Ebioscience (San Diego, AC, USA). Triglyceride
(TG), total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein (LDL)
cholesterol, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate
transaminase (AST) assay kits were purchased from Asan Co.
(Seoul, Korea).
2.2. Preparation of Lactobacillus plantarum LC27 and
Bifidobacterium longum LC67
LC27 and LC67 were grown in general media for probiotics.
Briefly, these probiotics were grown to the density of 2–4 × 109
CFU mL−1 and centrifuged to harvest cells. Collected bacterial
cells (2 × 109 CFU per 0.2 mL) were suspended in phosphate
buffered saline (PBS) or 1% glucose. Cells suspended in PBS
were inactivated at 80 °C for 30 min and used for cell experi￾ments. Cells suspended in 1% dextrose were used for in vivo
experiment.
2.3. Culture of Caco-2 cells
Caco-2 cells (Korean Cell Line Bank, Seoul, Korea) were cul￾tured in RPMI 1640 (Sigma, St Louis, MO) containing 1% anti￾biotic–antimycotic and 10% fetal bovine serum (RAF) at
37 °C.25 For the assay of NF-κB activation and tight junction
protein expression, cells (2 × 105 cells per mL) were treated
with LPS (100 ng mL−1
) or ethanol (50 μL mL−1
) in the absence
or presence of LC27 or LC67 (1 × 103 or 1 × 105 cells per mL)
for 90 min (for NF-κB activation) or 20 h (for tight junction,
iNOS, and COX-2 proteins). Proteins were measured by
immunoblotting.
2.4. Animals
Male ICR mice (21–23 g, 7 weeks old) were purchased from the
Orient Co., Ltd, a branch of Charles River Laboratories
(Gyeonggi-do, Korea). The mice were housed in a wire cage
under controlled conditions (temperature, 20–22 °C; and
humidity, 50 ± 10%) and fed standard laboratory chow and
water. The experiment was ethically approved by the
Committee for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of
Kyung Hee University (IRB No, KHUASP(SE)-17-013) and per￾formed in accordance with the Kyung Hee University
Guidelines for Laboratory Animals Care and Usage.
2.5. Induction of ethanol-induced steatosis in mice
Ethanol-induced steatosis was induced in mice according to
the modified method of Chen et al.26 The mice were randomly
divided into eight groups. Each group consisted of 7 mice.
Briefly, the mice were sequentially fed Lieber-DeCarli (LB) diet
(DYET#710260, Dyets, Inc., Bethlehem, PA. USA) containing
1% ethanol for one day, 2% ethanol for 4 days, and 5%
ethanol for 10 days and gavaged 30% ethanol (5.0 g kg−1
, dis￾solved in saline) on day 16. Test agents (group 2; vehicle [1%
dextrose] alone; group 3, silymarin [100 mg kg−1
]; group 4, 5 ×
108 CFU of LC27 per mouse; group 5, 2 × 109 CFU of LC27 per
mouse; group 6, 5 × 108 CFU of LC67 per mouse; group 7, 2 ×
109 CFU of LC67 per mouse; or group 8, their mixture [LM, the
mixture of 1 × 109 CFU of LC27 per mouse and 1 × 109 CFU of
LC27]) were orally administered for 5 days (from day 7 after
the initial treatment with 5% ethanol-containing LB diet). The
final test agents were treated 1 h before the oral gavage of
ethanol. The normal control group (group 1) was fed with
normal LB diet (Dyet#710027) instead of the ethanol-contain￾ing LB diet and 1% glucose instead of test agents (suspended
in 1% glucose). The mice were sacrificed 15 h after the final
administration of test agents, and whole-blood samples were
immediately withdrawn from the carotid artery. Serum was
prepared by centrifugation (10 min, 250g) and TG, TC, LDL
cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, ALT, AST, and γ-GTP levels were
determined according to the methods of Kwon et al.21 Liver
and colon tissues were removed for histological examination,
ELISA, and immunoblotting.
2.6. Histological examination
For the histological examination, the livers were fixed in 4%
paraformaldehyde, frozen in optimal cutting temperature solu￾tion, cut into 10 µm sections using a cryostat (Leica, Nussloch,
Germany), stained with hematoxylin–eosin or oil red O, and
observed under a light microscope.
2.7. Tissue preparation
Excised liver and colon tissues of the mice were perfused with
ice-cold perfusion solution (0.15 M KCl, 2 mM EDTA, pH 7.4),
homogenized in 50 mM Tris–HCl buffer (pH 7.4), and centri￾fuged at 10 000g and 4 °C for 30 min21 The resulting super￾natants were used for ELISA and immunoblotting.

2.8. ELISA and immunoblotting
For ELISA, the supernatant of tissues was transferred to
96-well ELISA plates. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α concen￾trations were determined, using commercial ELISA kits.21,25
For immunoblotting, the supernatant of tissues (20 μg protein)
was separated by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis,
transferred to polyvinylidenedifluoride membranes, and then
hybridized overnight, at 4 °C with 1 : 1000 diluted AMP-acti￾vated protein kinase (AMPK), p-AMPK, inducible NO synthase
(iNOS), p65, p-p65, and β-actin antibodies. The membrane was
then incubated with 1 : 2000 diluted anti-rabbit or anti-mouse
immunoglobulin G secondary antibody for 1 h at room temp￾erature and washed 3 times with phosphate buffered saline
containing 0.1% Tween 20 for 10 min. Protein bands were
visualized with an enhanced chemiluminescence reagent.
2.9. Determination of malondialdehyde and nitric oxide
Malondialdehyde levels of tissues were assayed according to
the method of Lee et al.27 The reaction solution containing
8.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 20% acetate buffer (pH 3.5), and
thiobarbituric acid was mixed well with 0.2 mL tissue super￾natant for 3 min, incubated at 95 °C for 60 min, cooled on ice
for 5 min, and extracted with 1 mL distilled water and 2.5 mL
of an n-butanol : pyridine mixture (15 : 1, v/v). Supernatants
were measured at 532 nm. Nitrite levels were measured in the
tissue supernatant according to the method of Lee et al.27
2.10. Determination of blood and colonic fluid LPS
LPS levels in sera and feces were determined using diazo￾coupled LAL assays according to the manufacturer’s proto￾col.28 Briefly, feces collected from the mice (100 mg) were
placed in 50 mL of PBS in a pyrogen-free tube, sonicated for
1 h on ice, and centrifuged at 400g for 10 min. Supernatants
were collected and sterilized by filtration through a 0.45 μm
filter, followed by re-filtration through a 0.22 μm filter. The
fecal supernatant and sera (5 μL) were diluted 1 : 10 in
pyrogen-free water and heated at 70 °C for 10 min. LPS levels
in the heated fecal and sera samples were assayed using the
LAL Assay kit.
2.11. Quantitative real time-polymerase chain reaction
(qPCR)
Real-time PCR for Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria,
and δ/γ-Proteobacteria was performed with 100 ng total DNA
isolated from the colon fluid using a Takara thermal cycler
and SYBR premix reagents.29 The thermal cycling conditions
were as follows: 95 °C for 30 s, followed by 35 cycles of de￾naturation and amplification at 95 °C for 5 s and 63 °C for 30 s,
respectively. Gene expression levels were calculated relative to
bacterial rRNA, using Microsoft Excel. Primers were used as

3. Results
3.1. Effects of LC27 and LC67 on ethanol-induced steatosis
in mice
To understand whether LC27 and LC67 could attenuate
ethanol-induced steatosis, we induced steatosis in mice by
sequential feeding of LB diet containing 1–5% ethanol and
gavaging ethanol and investigated the effects of LC27, LC67, or
LM against ethanol-induced steatosis. Ethanol intake signifi￾cantly increased TG, TC, and LDL-cholesterol levels, as well as
ALT, AST, and γ-GTP levels in the blood (Fig. 1). Furthermore,
ethanol treatment increased TNF-α and LPS levels in the
blood. The oral administration of LC27, LC67, or LM sup￾pressed ethanol-induced TG, TC, LDL-cholesterol, ALT, AST,
γ-GTP, TNF-α, and LPS levels while their treatments increased
HDL-cholesterol levels. The oral administration of LC67 at a
dose of 2 × 109 CFU per mouse most potently reduced ALT,
AST, γ-GTP, and LPS levels. Its inhibitory effect is comparable
to those treated with silymarin (50 mg kg−1
), a positive agent.
When LC27 and LC67 were combined at 1 : 1, 3 : 1, and 9 : 1
ratios, their effects were not different.
Treatment with ethanol also increased TG, TC, and LDL￾cholesterol levels and reduced ADH and ALDH activities in the
liver (Fig. 2). Treatment with LC27, LC67, or LM suppressed
ethanol-induced TG, TC, LDL-cholesterol, ALT, and AST levels
and increased ethanol-suppressed ADH and ALDH activities.
The oral administration of LC27 at a dose of 2 × 109 CFU per
mouse most potently decreased TG, TC, and LDL-cholesterol
levels and increased HDL-cholesterol levels. Moreover, ethanol
intake induced the expression of α-smooth muscle actin
(α-SMA), which plays an important role in fibroblast contracti￾lity,31 while treatment with LC27, LC67, or LM suppressed
ethanol-induced α-SMA expression.
Ethanol intake increased myeloperoxidase activity and TNF￾α, NO, and malondialdehyde levels in the liver (Fig. 3).
Histological examination showed that ethanol treatment accel￾erated fat accumulation in the liver. However, the oral adminis￾tration of LC27, LC67, or LM significantly suppressed ethanol￾induced TNF-α, NO, and malondialdehyde levels, myeloperoxi￾dase activity, and fat accumulation. Particularly, the oral
administration of LC27 at a dose of 2 × 109 CFU per mouse
most potently inhibited myeloperoxidase activity. Ethanol

intake induced iNOS, and COX-2 expression and NF-κB acti￾vation in the liver and suppressed the expression of tight
junction proteins occludin and caludin-1 and the activation of
AMPK, which stimulates hepatic fatty acid oxidation and
inhibits cholesterol synthesis, lipogenesis, and triglyceride
synthesis,30 while treatment with LC27, LC67, or LM sup￾pressed iNOS, COX-2 expression and NF-κB activation and
increased AMPK activation (Fig. 4). Moreover, treatment with
LC27, LC67, or LM suppressed ethanol-induced α-SMA
expression.

3.2. Effects of LC27 and LC67 on ethanol-induced
gastrointestinal (GI) inflammation in mice
Next, we investigated whether LC27, LC67, or LM could attenu￾ate ethanol-induced gastrointestinal inflammation. Ethanol
intake significantly induced gastrointestinal inflammation: it
increased the myeloperoxidase activity in the stomach, small
intestine, and colon, as well as distinctive signs of hemorrha￾gic gastritis, like the previous report26 (Fig. 5). These pathol￾ogies were not observed in the normal control group treated
with the vehicle alone. The oral administration of LC27, LC67,
or LM significantly suppressed the ethanol-induced GI inflam￾mation: they suppressed the myeloperoxidase activity in the
stomach, duodenum, and colon, as well as the distinctive
signs of colitis. Treatment with LC27 (2 × 109 CFU per mouse)
most potently inhibited the myeloperoxidase activity in the GI
tract, as observed in the liver. Moreover, treatment with LC27,
LC67, or LM suppressed ethanol-induced NF-κB activation and
TNF-α expression, as well as increased the ethanol-suppressed
expression of tight junction proteins.
3.3. Effects of LC27 and LC67 on the gut microbiota
composition in mice with ethanol-induced steatosis
Ethanol intake disturbed the gut microbiota composition and
increased the gut microbiota LPS production. In the present
study, we also found that ethanol intake increased the popu￾lations of Firmicutes and Proteobacteria but reduced the popu￾Fig. 2 Effects of Lactobacillus plantarum LC27 and Bifidobacterium longum LC67 on the ethanol-induced steatosis and liver damage in mice. (A)

LC27 and LC67 [2 × 109 CFU per mouse]) were orally administered once a day for 5 days. The mice were sacrificed 15 h after the final administration
of test agents. The normal control group (NOR) was treated with saline instead of ethanol and 1% dextrose instead of test agents. All data are rep￾resented as mean ± SD (n = 7). Means with the same letters are not significantly different (p < 0.05).

lations of Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria while the survival
rate of orally administered probiotics in the GI tract could not
be analyzed. The oral administration of LC27 most potently
increased the Actinobacteria population. Moreover, they sup￾pressed the ethanol-induced gut microbiota LPS levels.
3.4. Effects of LC27 and LC67 on tight junction protein
expression and NF-κB activation in ethanol-induced Caco-2 cells
To understand whether LC27 or LC67 could affect the gut
membrane permeability, we investigated their effects on the
expression of tight junction proteins in Caco-2 cells (Fig. 7).
Ethanol treatment significantly suppressed the expression of
occludin and claudin-1. However, LC27 or LC67 treatment
increased the ethanol-suppressed occludin and claudin-1
expression. These also suppressed ethanol-induced NF-κB and
IκB activation. Furthermore, LPS also significantly suppressed
the expression of occludin and claudin-1 and increased NF-κB
activation, while LC27 or LC67 treatment increased the LPS￾induced occludin and claudin-1 expression and suppressed
the LPS-induced NF-κB activation.

stomach, leading to GI inflammation and ulcers.32 Moreover,
ethanol intake significantly suppressed the number of lacto￾bacilli and bifidobacteria in the feces of mice and increased
the number of enterobacteria and enterococci, resulting in the
LPS production of gut microbiota.10,11 These accelerate the
absorption of macromolecules such as LPS from the GI tract
into the blood and liver due to GI inflammation and ulcers,
leading to systemic diseases such as hepatitis, hepatic steato￾sis, and hepatocirrhosis.10,33,34 Therefore, restoring the dis￾turbance of gut microbiota by ethanol intake can be beneficial
for hepatic diseases such as hepatic steatosis.
In the present study, we observed that the intake of ethanol
caused GI inflammation in the stomach, small intestine, and
colon. Ethanol intake also disturbed the gut microbiota: it
increased the population of Proteobacteria, which potently
produce LPS, and reduced the population of Actinobacteria.
Furthermore, ethanol treatment increased the gut microbiota
LPS production, as well blood LPS levels. Jang et al. reported
that LPS-induced GI inflammation increases the membrane
permeability of macromolecules, such as LPS, in the GI tract.35
These results suggest that ethanol intake can increase the
absorption of gut microbiota macromolecules from the GI
tract into the blood due to the overexpression of LPS by the gut

microbiota disturbance. However, the oral administration of
LC27 or/and LC67 significantly inhibited the ethanol-induced
NF-κB activation, TNF-α, and myeloperoxidase activity in the
GI tract and reduced the blood LPS level and the P/A ratio.
These results suggest that the amelioration of ethanol-induced
GI inflammation by LC27 or/and LC67 treatment can reduce
the blood LPS level. Furthermore, they inhibited the ethanol￾induced expression of iNOS and the production of malondial￾dehyde and NO. These findings suggest that LC27 and
LC67 may alleviate the GI inflammation by inhibiting the acti￾vation of neutrophils and macrophages and scavenging radical
oxygen species. The activation of neutrophils and macro￾phages is associated with the activation of NF-κB and up-regu￾lation of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α.
36,37
Furthermore, LC27 or/and LC67 decreased ethanol-induced
fecal and blood LPS levels and increased ethanol-suppressed
tight junction protein expression. These findings suggest that
ethanol intake can cause GI inflammation by the disturbance
of the gut microbiota composition and the over-production of
gut microbiota LPS, resulting in the increase in the gut mem￾brane permeability of gut bacterial LPS into the blood. We also
found that the intake of ethanol could cause liver damage and
steatosis in mice: it increased TNF-α, iNOS, and COX-2
expression, NF-κB activation, malondialdehyde, NO, and fat
accumulation and decreased the tight junction protein
expression and AMPK activation in the liver. Ethanol intake
caused fat accumulation and increased the α-SMA expression
in the liver. All these factors act in concert to exacerbate the
liver damage such as hepatitis, hepatic steatosis, and hepato￾cirrhosis.38,39 LC27 or/and LC67 significantly reduced the
ethanol-induced ALT and AST levels in the blood, which are
one of the most widely used means for assessing the extent of
hepatic damage,40 as well as the TG and TC levels in the liver
and blood. LC67 more potently reduced the ALT and AST
levels. Its effect is comparable to that of silymarin. Moreover,
even if LC27 and LC67 at 1 : 1, 3 : 1, and 9 : 1 ratios were com￾bined, their effects were not different. Overall, LC27 and LC67
additively reduced the ethanol-induced ALT and AST levels.
In addition, Mutlu et al. reported that ethanol intake
caused alcohol-induced intestinal dysbiosis, endotoxemia, and
steatohepatitis in rats.10 These results suggest that the intake
of ethanol can cause alcoholic hepatic steatosis and hepato￾cirrhosis through GI and liver inflammation and LC27 or/and
LC67 can inhibit ethanol-induced liver injury by inhibiting the
inflammatory signaling pathway. Moreover, we found that
LC27 or LC67 treatment might inhibit the promotion of
hepatic fibrosis by suppressing the α-smooth muscle actin
expression. These results suggest that LC27 or/and LC67 may
attenuate the progression of hepatic fibrosis. Additionally,
Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus CCFM1107,
Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, and Lactobacillus casei MYL01
attenuated alcoholic gastritis and hepatic injury.20,21,41–43
Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG downregulated the ethanol￾induced expressions of lipogenic and pro-inflammatory genes
in the liver, improved intestinal tight junction (TJ) proteins,
and reversed the alcohol-disturbed populations of Th17 and
regulatory T cells’ population.18,26 Lactobacillus rhamnosus
CCFM1107 prevented alcoholic liver injury by reducing oxi￾dative stress and restoring the intestinal flora.20 VSL#3, a
mixture of eight lactic acid bacteria, also attenuated ethanol￾induced liver injury in mice by regulating the expression of
tight junction proteins and increasing epithelial per￾meability.44 These results suggest that lactobacilli and bifido￾bacteria can alleviate alcohol-induced hepatic steatosis.
5. Conclusion
The oral administration of LC27 or/and LC67 in mice sup￾pressed the ethanol-induced myeloperoxidase activity, TNF-α
expression, and NF-κB activation in the GI tract. These also
restored the ethanol-induced gut microbiota disturbance and

suppressed the fecal and blood LPS levels. Treatment with
LC27 or/and LC67 increased the ethanol-suppressed
expression of gut tight junction proteins, as well as reduced
ethanol-induced blood ALT, AST, and TNF-α levels. Treatment
with LC27 or/and LC67 alleviated ethanol-induced TG, TC,
LDL-cholesterol, and TNF-α levels in the blood and liver, as
well as suppressed the NF-κB activation and malondialdehyde
and NO levels in the liver. Conclusively, LC27 and LC67 may
simultaneously alleviate ethanol-induced GI inflammation,
liver injury, and steatosis by inhibiting LPS-mediated NF-κB
activation through restoration of the gut microbiota
disturbance.
