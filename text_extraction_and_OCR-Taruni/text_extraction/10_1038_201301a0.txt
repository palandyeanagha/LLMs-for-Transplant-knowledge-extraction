Abstract
IT has been previously demonstrated, that dl-nor-epinephrine-3H is
bound by the isolated perfused dog gracilis muscle and that nerve
stimulation causes a release of the bound nore-epinephrine-3H. Both
nor-epinephrine-3H and epinephrine-3H are bound in dense core
vesicles of sympathetic nerve endings1. We therefore examined the
possibility that epinephrine-3H taken up from the circulation could
also be released by stimulation of sympathetic nerves.
