Human graft endothelial cells (ECs) can act as antigen-presenting cells to initiate allograft rejection by host 
memory T cells. Rapamycin, an mTOR inhibitor used clinically to suppress T cell responses, also acts on DCs, 
rendering them tolerogenic. Here, we report the effects of rapamycin on EC alloimmunogenicity. Compared 
with mock-treated cells, rapamycin-pretreated human ECs (rapa-ECs) stimulated less proliferation and cytokine 
secretion from allogeneic CD4+ memory cells, an effect mimicked by shRNA knockdown of mTOR or raptor 
in ECs. The effects of rapamycin persisted for several days and were linked to upregulation of the inhibitory 
molecules PD-L1 and PD-L2 on rapa-ECs. Additionally, rapa-ECs produced lower levels of the inflammatory 
cytokine IL-6. CD4+ memory cells activated by allogeneic rapa-ECs became hyporesponsive to restimulation in 
an alloantigen-specific manner and contained higher percentages of suppressive CD4+CD25hiCD127loFoxP3+
cells that did not produce effector cytokines. In a human-mouse chimeric model of allograft rejection, rapamy￾cin pretreatment of human arterial allografts increased graft EC expression of PD-L1 and PD-L2 and reduced 
subsequent infiltration of allogeneic effector T cells into the artery intima and intimal expansion. Preoperative 
conditioning of allograft ECs with rapamycin could potentially reduce immune-mediated rejection.
Introduction
Immune-mediated rejection represents a significant barrier to the 
success of solid organ transplantation. Host alloreactive CD4+
T cells that cross-react to recognize non-self (allogeneic) MHC 
molecules expressed on donor-derived APCs carried along in the 
graft are critical mediators of rejection (1). APC function requires 
expression of MHC-peptide complexes (the antigen or signal 1), 
expression of antigen-independent costimulators (signal 2), and, 
often, production of activating cytokines (signal 3). Human vascu￾lar ECs in situ basally express MHC class I and class II molecules 
(2, 3); costimulatory molecules such as LFA-3 (CD58), ICOS ligand 
(CD275), OX40 ligand (CD252), 41BB ligand (CD137L), CD40, 
and GITR ligand (4); and cytokines such as IL-1α, IL-6, IL-15, and 
IL-18 (5–8) that can contribute to T cell activation and differen￾tiation. This panoply of molecular signals enables human ECs to 
function as APCs and activate allogeneic memory, but not naive, 
CD4+ T cells to proliferate, secrete effector cytokines, and reject 
human allografts in immunodeficient mouse hosts (4, 9–11). 
Human ECs can also deliver inhibitory signals via expression of 
PD-L1 (also known as B7-H1 or CD274) and PD-L2 (also known 
as B7-DC or CD273), which bind to PD-1 (CD279) on T cells (12, 
13). The balance of positive and negative signals on ECs affects the 
net outcome of memory T cell responses.
Human peripheral blood CD4+ T cells in adults are approxi￾mately equally divided between naive and memory cells. Memory 
T cells are important mediators of rejection in clinical transplan￾tation (14, 15), and a significant percentage of circulating memory 
cells in human transplant recipients, likely generated during prior 
microbial infections, cross-react to recognize donor graft allo￾antigens (16). Furthermore, the frequency of donor-specific mem￾ory T cells correlates with the likelihood of rejection (17). Because 
alloreactive memory T cells can be activated by ECs, it is believed 
that allograft ECs are sufficient to trigger rejection by directly pre￾senting alloantigen to and activating host alloreactive memory 
T cells (18) in the absence of graft-derived professional APCs. This 
is in marked contrast to the phenotype in rats, in which the pas￾senger leukocytes, defined as professional APCs present within a 
solid organ allograft, have been shown to be necessary to initiate 
rejection (19). Despite this pathogenic role, there are no clinical 
therapies aimed at reducing EC alloimmunogenicity.
CD4+ effector T cells are a heterogeneous population that can 
be divided into multiple subsets defined by their cytokine pro￾files. Among these subsets are Th1 cells, which express the mas￾ter transcription factor T-bet and secrete IFN-γ; Th2 cells, which 
express the master transcription factor GATA3 and secrete IL-4, 
IL-5, and IL-13; and Th17 cells, which express the master tran￾scription factor RORγT and secrete IL-17A and IL-17F (20, 21). All 
three subsets are capable of causing allograft destruction (22–25). 
A fourth subset of CD4+ T cells, called Tregs, can suppress immune 
responses and comprises at least two major populations: natural 
and inducible Tregs (26). Natural Tregs develop in the thymus, 
recognize self antigens, control autoimmunity, and express high 
levels of CD25 and the transcription factor FoxP3. Although 
activated human T effector cells also express CD25 and FoxP3, 
expression in natural Tregs is generally higher and more sustained, 
a difference attributable to reduced methylation of DNA in a crit￾ical transcriptional control region of the FOXP3 gene known as 
the Treg-specific demethylated region (TSDR) (27). Inducible 
Tregs (iTregs) form in the periphery and develop or convert from 
conventional CD25-negative CD4+ T cells that may also have the 
potential to become effector T cells (26). Such iTregs, which may

or may not stably express FoxP3, are specific for non-self antigens 
(including alloantigens) and likely restrain immune responses to 
environmental antigens (28–30). Both natural and inducible Tregs 
prevent rejection and induce allograft tolerance in several models 
of transplantation (31–33).
The milieu in which a CD4+ T cell becomes activated largely 
determines the acquisition of specific effector or regulatory func￾tions (reviewed in refs. 20, 21). In the case of Tregs, development 
of some types of iTregs requires TGF-β and the absence of IL-6 
(26), whereas other types are induced by IL-10 (34). In addition to 
cytokines, formation of iTregs can also be driven by cell surface 
signals provided by APCs (35), such as PD-L1, which promotes 
iTreg differentiation even in the absence of TGF-β (36). Although 
these observations are based on studies of naive T cell commit￾ment, human memory CD4+ T cells display plasticity and are capa￾ble of acquiring regulatory activity following antigenic restimula￾tion (5, 37–39). The relationship between human ECs and Tregs is 
incompletely understood, and it is unknown whether human ECs 
can be induced to express molecules that favor activation or dif￾ferentiation of tolerance-promoting Tregs instead of pathogenic 
inflammatory effectors T cells.
Since its approval in 1999, rapamycin has been used as an immu￾nosuppressant in human transplant recipients (40). Rapamycin 
acts by forming a complex with a cytosolic prolyl isomerase known 
as FK-BP12, and the drug-protein complex acts as an inhibitor 
of mTOR, a 289-kDa serine/threonine protein kinase that inte￾grates environmental cues to regulate cell growth and division 
(41). More specifically, rapamycin targets mTOR as part of an 
mTOR signaling complex (called mTORC1) that also contains 
a protein called raptor that is critical for its function. Prolonged 
rapamycin treatment has been shown to inhibit another mTOR￾containing signaling complex, known as mTORC2 (42), that lacks 
raptor but instead contains a protein called rictor that is critical 
for its function. In CD4+ T cells, mTOR is activated in response to 
IL-2 or other growth-promoting cytokines, and it is believed that 
rapamycin achieves immune suppression by inhibiting growth fac￾tor–driven lymphocyte proliferation. In addition to its effects on 
T cells, recent data suggest that rapamycin may also target mTOR 
in APCs (43), altering their function. Human and rodent bone 
marrow–derived DCs treated with rapamycin display decreased 
expression of MHC and costimulatory molecules, an effect resis￾tant to maturation signals. These rapamycin-treated DCs poorly 
stimulate allogeneic T cells, induce alloantigen-specific anergy, 
and selectively expand FoxP3+ regulatory T cells (44–46). In rodent 
models of allograft rejection, infusion of rapamycin-treated, allo￾antigen-pulsed DCs into the host prior to transplant results in 
prolonged graft survival, associated with increased frequencies of 
FoxP3+ cells in the spleen and infiltrating into the graft (45, 47). 
Based on these data, we hypothesized that rapamycin may also 
have tolerance-promoting effects on human ECs.
Here we show that pretreatment of cultured human umbilical 
vein ECs with rapamycin reduces proliferation and cytokine secre￾tion of cocultured allogeneic memory CD4+ T cells, a phenotypic 
change that can be replicated by shRNA knockdown of mTOR or 
raptor in the ECs. Rapamycin treatment or knockdown of mTOR 
or raptor affected both costimulator molecule expression and 
cytokine production, but Ab-blocking experiments linked reduced 
allostimulatory capacity to the upregulation of the inhibitory mol￾ecules PD-L1 and PD-L2 on rapa-ECs. T cells activated by rapa-ECs 
became hyporesponsive to restimulation, in an alloantigen-specific 
manner, and contained an increased ratio of CD4+CD25hiCD127lo
FoxP3+ to CD4+CD25+FoxP3– T cells. These FoxP3+ cells were func￾tionally suppressive, displayed demethylation of the TSDR within 
the FOXP3 gene, and did not secrete effector cytokines. Finally, 
using a humanized mouse model of artery allograft rejection, we 
demonstrate that treatment of human vessels with rapamycin prior 
to transplant reduced both the infiltration of allogeneic T cells into 
the vessel intima and intimal expansion, an effect that coincided 
with increased expression of PD-L1 and PD-L2 on treated graft 
ECs and was diminished by PD-1 blockade. These data show that 
rapamycin reduces alloimmunogenicity and confers tolerance-pro￾moting effects on ECs in vitro and in vivo.
Results
Rapamycin-pretreated ECs poorly stimulate allogeneic memory CD4+
T cells. To study the effects of rapamycin on EC alloimmuno￾genicity, we treated MHC class II+ ECs with varying doses of 
rapamycin (up to 100 ng/ml) for up to 72 hours, then washed 
away drug and cocultured pretreated ECs with purified alloge￾neic resting memory CD4+ T cells. There was no difference in 
the ability of T cells to recognize allogeneic MHC class II mol￾ecules on control ECs and rapa-ECs, as evidenced by a similar 
degree of induction of CD25, an activation marker expressed in 
response to TCR signaling, at 72 hours (Figure 1A). However, 
T cells stimulated by rapa-ECs secreted less IL-2 and IFN-γ at 24 
hours (Figure 1B) and were poorly proliferative compared with 
T cells cocultured with control EC, an effect dependent on both 
drug dose and treatment duration (Figure 1C). To determine 
the longevity of this effect, ECs were treated with rapamycin for 
72 hours, washed, cultured in the absence of drug for up to 7 
days, and then cocultured with allogeneic memory CD4+ T cells. 
We found that at low doses, rapa-ECs were poorly stimulatory 
compared with untreated ECs even after 4 days following drug 
washout, while at high doses, the effects of rapamycin treat￾ment persisted for as long as 7 days (Figure 1D). To determine 
whether changes in cell surface or soluble factors were respon￾sible for the decreased allostimulatory capacity of rapa-ECs, 
we cultured control ECs or rapa-ECs across a Transwell from 
cocultures of untreated autologous ECs and allogeneic memory 
CD4+ T cells. T cell proliferation, in the lower chamber, was 
unaffected when either control ECs or rapa-ECs (Figure 1E) 
were plated in the upper chamber, suggesting that rapamycin 
likely reduces EC alloimmunogenicity by altering expression of 
cell surface molecules.
Because rapamycin is known to directly inhibit effector CD4+
T cells, it is possible that the observed inhibition of T cell allore￾sponses resulted from carryover of rapamycin from the pretreat￾ment period into the EC–T cell cocultures, where it directly acts on 
T cells. To address this possibility and to confirm that the effect of 
rapamycin was mediated by inhibition of mTOR in the ECs, we used 
shRNA to knock down mTOR in the ECs (Figure 2A). Since carry￾over of shRNA is extremely unlikely, this approach allowed us to dis￾tinguish the effects of specifically inhibiting mTOR in ECs. Similar 
to rapa-ECs, mTOR-knockdown ECs poorly stimulated prolifera￾tion of allogeneic memory CD4+ T cells (Figure 2B), suggesting that 
rapamycin reduces the allostimulatory capacity of ECs by inhibit￾ing mTOR signaling. To determine which specific mTOR signaling 
complex regulates EC alloimmunogenicity, we knocked down essen￾tial components of each complex, raptor for mTORC1 and rictor for 
mTORC2 (Figure 2C). These experiments revealed that allogeneic

T cells proliferated less when stimulated by either mTOR- or raptor￾knockdown ECs, but not when rictor was knocked down (Figure 
2D). Interestingly, knockdown of rictor in ECs slightly increased 
proliferation of cocultured T cells. We conclude that disruption of 
mTORC1 signaling reduces EC alloimmunogenicity.
Allogeneic memory CD4+ T cells stimulated by rapa-ECs are hyporespon￾sive to restimulation. To distinguish between immunologic ignorance 
and induction of tolerance, we investigated whether T cells were 
functionally altered by coculture with rapa-ECs by testing their 
ability to respond to restimulation. CD4+ memory T cells first 
cocultured with allogeneic rapa-ECs, for 72 hours, proliferated less 
when restimulated by untreated ECs from either the same donor 
as used in the primary stimulation or third-party donors (Figure 
3A); however, this hyporesponsiveness was more profound when 
matched ECs were used as restimulators. This suggests that T cells 
cocultured with rapa-ECs become hyporesponsive in at least a partly 
alloantigen-specific manner. It is important to note that after 72 
hours of primary stimulation, the percentages of T cells activated by 
control and rapa-EC (as judged by CD25+) were equal (Figure 1A). 
Thus, the decreased proliferation of T cells cocultured with rapa￾ECs upon restimulation does not reflect differences in the degree of 
expansion during primary stimulation. The lesser reduced response 
to third-party ECs could imply some contribution of MHC-inde￾pendent hyporesponsiveness, but since the ECs were not HLA typed, 
we cannot rule out the possibility of shared MHC alleles. In either 
case, the functional alteration was highly dependent on TCR recog￾nition of MHC class II molecules on rapa-ECs, as addition of block￾ing antibodies to HLA-DR in primary EC–T cell cocultures largely, 
but not completely, prevented the development of hyporesponsive￾ness by rapa-EC–primed T cells during restimulation (Figure 3B).

This incomplete blockade also may be interpreted as an MHC-inde￾pendent contribution, but even though HLA-DR is the dominant 
determinant of direct CD4+ T cell allorecognition, we cannot rule 
out small contributions from recognition of HLA-DP and HLA-DQ 
that at not blocked by our antibody.
Rapa-ECs induce an increased percentage of CD4+CD25hiCD127lo
FoxP3+ cells. The observation that allogeneic CD4+ T cells stimu￾lated by rapa-ECs become hyporesponsive to restimulation could 
be due to clonal anergy, to clonal deletion, or to activation or 
induction of Tregs. We did not detect any differences in cell death 
(assessed by Annexin V or propidium iodide) in T cells stimulated 
by control ECs or rapa-ECs (data not shown), arguing against 
clonal deletion. To address the possibilities of anergy or Treg 
induction, we cocultured memory CD4 T+ cells with allogeneic 
control ECs or rapa-ECs for 72 hours and FACS sorted activated 
T cells on the basis of CD4+CD25+ expression. Using qRT-PCR, we

found that T cells activated by rapa-ECs did not express increased 
transcript levels of the anergy-associated genes GRAIL, ITCH, and 
CBLB but did contain significantly higher mRNA levels of the Treg 
master transcription factor FOXP3 (Figure 4A). We were intrigued 
by this result, given the observation that rapamycin-treated DCs 
favor activation and expansion of Tregs. To determine whether 
rapa-ECs have a similar capability, we performed intracellular 
FACS analysis on allogeneic memory CD4+CD25– T cells cocul￾tured with rapa-ECs and found that activated (now CD25+)

FoxP3+ T cells compared with cocultures with control ECs (Figure

a greater percentage of CD25hiCD127lo T cells (Figure 4E) com￾pared with T cells activated by control ECs; in both groups these 
CD25hiCD127lo cells were greater than 95% FoxP3+ (data not

T cells used to initiate the cocultures were depleted of preexisting 
CD25+ cells (reduced from about 2% of the memory CD4+ popu￾lation to less than 0.02%; data not shown), a pool that contains 
the natural Tregs, prior to coculture. In other words, the CD25+
FoxP3+ cells induced by coculture with rapa-ECs arise from previ￾ously CD25– cells and thus could qualify as being iTregs. However, 
about 4%–6% of human CD25– memory CD4+ T cells in periph￾eral blood expressed FoxP3 (Figure 4B), and we cannot determine 
whether CD25hiFoxP3+ T cells arise from this population, a previ￾ously FoxP3– population, or both. Last, allogeneic memory T cells 
activated by mTOR-knockdown ECs similarly contained a greater 
percentage of FoxP3+ cells (Figure 4C), suggesting that our obser￾vations with rapa-ECs were not due to carryover of rapamycin act￾ing directly on T cells.
In humans, FoxP3 is not an exclusive marker of Tregs, as it 
is also transiently expressed on activated conventional CD4+
T cells (48, 49). To determine whether CD4+CD25hiCD127lo
FoxP3+ cells induced by rapa-ECs were Tregs, we tested their 
functional characteristics using in vitro suppression assays. 
Because the frequency of alloreactive T cells capable of respond￾ing to an EC donor is low (1%), we were limited in the ability to 
sort sufficient numbers of cells for use in suppression assays. 
To bypass this obstacle, we used a system previously developed 
in our laboratory (50) wherein ECs are retrovirally transduced 
to express the extracellular domain of CD32, an FcγR that binds 
and displays IgG antibodies, and then preloaded with the anti￾CD3 antibody OKT3. These OKT3-loaded ECs are capable of 
polyclonally activating 100% of T cells. Using this system, we 
confirmed that T cells activated by anti-CD3–loaded CD32+
rapa-ECs contained higher percentages of CD4+CD25hiCD￾127loFoxP3+ cells (Figure 5A). These cells were then sorted on 
the basis of high CD25 expression and added to cocultures 
of freshly isolated CFSE-labeled T cells and OKT3-loaded 
ECs. Addition of these cells potently suppressed proliferation 
of the CFSE-labeled responder T cells (Figure 5A). Further￾more, analysis of bisulfite-converted DNA revealed that CD4+
CD25hiCD127lo T cells activated by rapa-ECs displayed strong 
demethylation of the TSDR within the FOXP3 gene (Figure 
5B). Together these data suggest that FoxP3+ cells activated 
by rapa-ECs are indeed Tregs. Analysis of the cytokines pro￾duced by these cells by intracellular cytokine staining revealed 
the absence of effector cytokines such as 
IFN-γ and IL-17, as well as the absence 
of inhibitory cytokines TGF-β and IL-10 
(Figure 5C). It is important to note, how￾ever, that such Tregs were also found in 
cocultures with control ECs; they sim￾ply represent a significantly smaller per￾centage of the total activated (CD25+) 
T cells compared with their frequency 
after coculture with rapa-ECs.
These experiments establish that the 
population of CD25+ T cells activated by 
rapa-ECs contains a greater percentage 
of Tregs. This shift in the balance could 
arise from an absolute expansion of Tregs, 
a reduction in the expansion of T effector 
cells, or both. FACS analysis suggest that 
the change in ratio largely resulted from a 
decrease in the number of effector T cells 
(i.e., FoxP3–) present within the CD25+ population (Figure 5D). 
To determine whether this change in the ratio of Tregs to T effec￾tor cells among activated T cells was functionally significant, we 
repeated our suppression assays using the total CD25+ population 
rather than focusing only on the CD25hi subset. The net effect of 
this altered balance of effector versus Tregs is that the total CD25+
population activated by rapa-ECs was more suppressive than the 
equivalent population activated by control ECs (Figure 5E).
Rapamycin alters EC expression of costimulatory molecules and secre￾tion of IL-6. To identify specific mechanisms by which rapamycin 
alters EC alloimmunogenicity, we investigated how the drug 
affects endothelial expression of immunologically relevant mole￾cules under basal and IFN-γ–stimulated conditions (Table 1). As 
expected, MHC class I was expressed under basal conditions and 
upregulated by IFN-γ, while MHC class II was only detected after 
IFN-γ treatment. Rapamycin did not alter expression of either 
molecule, consistent with our observation that equal frequen￾cies of T cells were initially activated by recognition of allogeneic 
MHC class II molecules on control ECs and rapa-ECs (Figure 
1A). CD40 was downregulated on rapa-ECs, while expression of 
the costimulatory molecules OX40 ligand and GITR ligand was 
increased under both basal and IFN-γ–stimulated conditions 
(OX40 ligand only). Furthermore, compared with control ECs, 
rapa-ECs expressed significantly higher levels of the inhibitory 
molecules PD-L1 and PD-L2 under basal conditions and also fol￾lowing optimal IFN-γ treatment. In addition to cell surface mole￾cules, we also investigated soluble mediators released by ECs that 
may influence the response of allogeneic T cells. Interestingly, we 
found that rapamycin profoundly inhibited EC secretion of the 
T cell–activating cytokine IL-6, in response to IFN-γ or to TNF 
(Figure 6A). In contrast, rapamycin only mildly reduced secretion 
of IL-8 in response to TNF (Figure 6A), suggesting that the reduc￾tion in IL-6 was not due to decreased viability or a generalized 
block of protein secretion in rapa-ECs.
To determine which component of mTOR signaling mediated 
these changes, we knocked down mTOR, raptor, and rictor in ECs. 
Similar to rapamycin treatment, mTOR knockdown increased 
expression of OX40 ligand, GITR ligand, PD-L1, and PD-L2, an 
effect that was phenocopied by raptor, but not rictor, knockdown 
(Table 2). mTOR knockdown also decreased EC secretion of IL-6 
in response to TNF, and interestingly, both raptor and rictor

knockdown reproduced this effect (Figure 6B). These data suggest 
that disruption of both mTOR signaling complexes is involved in 
mediating the effects of rapamycin.
PD-L1 and PD-L2 are induced by rapamycin and contribute to the 
decreased alloimmunogenicity of rapa-ECs. Of the cell surface changes 
induced by rapamycin (Table 1), we chose to focus on changes in 
PD-L1 and PD-L2, as these molecules are known to send inhibi￾tory signals to T cells. Using flow cytometric analysis, we found 
that rapamycin increased EC cell surface expression of PD-L1 
and PD-L2 in a dose-dependent manner with maximal induc￾tion occurring at 72 hours with 10 ng/ml drug (Figure 6C). Using 
qRT-PCR, we found that PDL1 and PDL2 mRNA transcripts were 
upregulated by rapamycin treatment, peaking at 24 hours but still 
remaining elevated at 72 hours (Figure 6D). To study the longevity 
of this effect, we cultured rapamycin-treated ECs in the absence of 
drug. With lower treatment doses, PD-L1 and PD-L2 remained ele￾vated 4 days after withdrawal of drug, while at higher doses these 
molecules were still elevated at 7 days (Figure 6E). Furthermore, 
shRNA knockdown of mTOR increased EC surface expression of 
PD-L1 and PD-L2 (Table 2), implying that the effect of rapamy￾cin was due to specific inhibition of mTOR signaling. Last, addi￾tion of PD-L1– and PD-L2–blocking antibodies into cocultures 
restored the ability of allogeneic memory CD4+ T cells to prolifer￾ate in response to rapa-ECs (Figure 7A). Because rapa-ECs secreted 
reduced amounts of IL-6 (Figure 6A), we investigated whether this 
deficit may also contribute to their weak allostimulatory abil￾ity. However, in contrast to PD-L1/PD-L2 blockade, addition of 
recombinant IL-6 to replace the missing cytokine did not com￾Figure 6

pensate for the rapamycin effect, as allogeneic T cells still poorly 
proliferated in response to rapa-ECs (Figure 7B). Collectively, these 
data suggest that rapamycin reduces EC alloimmunogenicity, at 
least in part, by increasing cell surface expression of PD-L1 and 
PD-L2. The reduction in IL-6 does not appear to have been func￾tionally significant in these in vitro assays.
It has been previously shown that PD-L1 and PD-L2 on APCs 
mediate peripheral tolerance and can enhance generation of 
Tregs (51). Additionally, the presence of IL-6 is known to antag￾onize the function and formation of Tregs (52). Since rapa-ECs 
have elevated expression of PD-L1 and PD-L2 and poorly secrete 
IL-6, we explored whether either of these effects contributed to the 
increased percentages of Tregs activated by rapa-ECs. We found 
that addition of recombinant IL-6 into cocultures had little effect 
on the percentage of FoxP3+ cells (Figure 7C). In contrast, serolog￾ical blockade of PD-L1 and PD-L2 partially reversed the increased 
percentage of FoxP3+ cells among activated T cells in rapa-EC ver￾sus control EC cocultures (Figure 7D). Thus, we conclude that the 
elevated expression of PD-L1 and PD-L2 on rapa-ECs significantly 
contributed to the preferential activation of CD25+FoxP3+ cells.
Rapamycin pretreatment reduces T cell–mediated injury in human 
artery allografts. To investigate whether pretreatment of allograft 
ECs with rapamycin can provide protective effects in vivo, we 
used a human-mouse chimeric model of artery allograft rejection 
recently developed by our laboratory (53). In this model, short seg￾ments of human artery are implanted into the infrarenal aortae of 
immunodeficient SCID/beige mice and left to heal for 30 days, at 
which point the graft is harvested and re-transplanted into a sec￾ond SCID/beige mouse previously receiving adoptive transferred 
of human PBMCs allogeneic to the artery graft. In these mice, 
adoptive transfer of human PBMCs yields stable engraftment of 
human CD3+ T cells capable of mediating graft rejection but does 
not result in engraftment of human myeloid (monocytes, macro￾phages, DCs, neutrophils) or NK cells. This re-transplant design 
was selected for three reasons. First, it assures that only the artery 
is exposed to drug, avoiding confounding effects of rapamycin on 
T cells. Second, by allowing the arteries to quiesce in the primary 
mouse host, the model eliminates variability (injury status, time 
from harvest/spent on ice) in the state of human arteries at the 
time the arteries first encounter allogeneic T cells, which could 
influence the subsequent T cell alloresponse. And third, because 
we can perform transplant into the sec￾ond host at a time of our choosing, we can 
ensure that recipients will have optimal 
levels of circulating human T cells at trans￾plant. This is a feature we cannot otherwise 
control, since circulating T cell numbers 
require 1–2 weeks to reach adequate levels 
but begin to cause pathological changes 
in the host after 4–5 weeks, and we do not 
know in advance when human artery seg￾ments will become available. This design 
also provides a closer recapitulation of clin￾ical transplantation, where allografts are 
transplanted into donors with circulating 
T cells in a “physiological” range.
To test whether rapamycin pretreatment 
has a protective role in vivo, we treated 
mice with healed artery grafts with vehi￾cle or rapamycin for 72 hours, at which 
time grafts were harvested, perfused, and re-transplanted into 
PBMC-inoculated mice. Because these secondary recipients are 
not exposed to rapamycin, the system allows us to determine the 
effects of rapamycin on graft alloimmunogenicity, independent 
of any direct effects on the circulating human lymphocytes. Fur￾thermore, at the time of re-transplant, the human artery graft 
consists of human luminal ECs, medial (and rare intimal) human 
smooth muscle cells, human adventitial fibroblasts and microves￾sels, but no detectable human (passenger) leukocytes (54). In other 
words, human ECs are the only functional allogeneic APCs in the 
graft. Using this model, we found that rapamycin pretreatment 
of grafts reduced the total number of T cells infiltrating into 
the vessel intima (Figure 8A) and concomitantly reduced both 
the total vessel area and intima expansion (Figure 8B) at 10 days 
following re-transplant. At this early stage, there was no loss of 
lumen in either group, as the outward expansion of the control 
vessels compensated for intimal expansion (Figure 8B and ref. 55). 
To determine the durability of this protective effect, we extended 
our experiments to 3 weeks following re-transplantation. At this 
later time, we found that rapamycin-pretreated grafts still had 
reduced total vessel areas and intima sizes compared with control 
grafts (Figure 8C); however, the magnitude of this effect appeared 
to be diminished relative to earlier time points. Together, these 
data suggest that pretreatment of allografts with rapamycin can 
reduce subsequent T cell–mediated rejection, although the effect 
may wane with time.
Based on our observations that rapamycin reduces the alloimmu￾nogenicity of cultured ECs via induction of PD-1 ligands, we exam￾ined graft expression of these molecules via immunofluorescence. 
We found that rapamycin-pretreated grafts, harvested 10 days after 
re-transplant into PBMC-inoculated mice, had pronounced EC 
expression of both PD-L1 and PD-L2 (Figure 9A). These molecules 
were barely detectable on the ECs lining replicate control-treated 
grafts re-transplanted into paired mice that had been adoptively 
transferred with the same human PBMCs. To determine whether 
this induced expression of PD-L1 and PD-L2 could be contributing 
to the protective effects observed in rapamycin-pretreated grafts, 
we transplanted paired rapamycin-pretreated grafts into pairs of 
PBMC-inoculated mice and treated these animals with either a neu￾tralizing F(ab′)2 fragment to PD-1 or an isotype-matched F(ab′)2 for 
14 days. (This anti–PD-1 F[ab′]2 fragment effectively reduced the

protective effect of rapamycin pretreatment of cultured ECs [data 
not shown].) We found that PD-1 blockade increased the vessel area 
and intima size of rapamycin-pretreated grafts (Figure 9B), as well 
as the number of infiltrating intimal T cells (Figure 9C), compared 
with animals treated with the isotype control. We conclude that 
PD-1 ligands contribute to the protection of rapamycin-pretreated 
grafts against T cell–mediated injury in vivo.
Discussion
We found that the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin modulates the 
alloimmunogenicity of human ECs. Specifically, rapa-ECs poorly 
stimulate alloreactive memory CD4+ T cells to proliferate and 
secrete effector cytokines without affecting recognition of MHC 
class II molecules on the ECs (assessed by induction of CD25). 
Similar effects were observed with ECs in which mTOR had 
been knocked down by shRNA. The recognition of MHC class II 
is significant, because T cells that had been cultured with rapa￾ECs became hyporesponsive to restimulation by ECs from the 
same donor, an effect largely abrogated by blocking MHC class II 
recognition in the primary culture. Additionally, T cells activated 
by rapa-ECs contained an increased ratio of suppressive CD4+
CD25hiCD127loFoxP3+ Tregs to CD4+CD25+FoxP3– effector 
T cells. Mechanistically, rapamycin treatment (or mTOR knock￾down) altered endothelial expression of several costimulatory 
molecules, but not MHC molecules, and reduced EC secretion 
of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-6 in response to IFN-γ and 
TNF. The primary effect on the CD4+ T cell responses appears to 
be mediated via induction of PD-L1 and PD-L2 on rapa-ECs, an 
effect that appears to be much more substantial than the previ￾ously described upregulation of these molecules in response to 
IFN-γ. In vivo, in a human-mouse chimeric model, pretreatment 
of human artery allografts with rapamycin led to upregulation of

PD-L1 and PD-L2 on graft ECs and protected allografts, for up to 
3 weeks, against subsequent T cell–mediated infiltration and rejec￾tion, while blockade of PD-1 worsened immune injury in rapamy￾cin-pretreated grafts.
The exclusive use of human materials in our studies provides 
two major advantages over murine systems. First, human ECs 
can activate resting allogeneic effector memory CD4+ T cells 
(10), whereas mouse ECs only activate CD4+ Tregs (56). Given 
their expression of MHC molecules and their direct contact 
with the host circulation, vascularized graft ECs are the first 
donor-derived cells to encounter and interact with the recipient 
immune system. Thus, it is likely that the EC–CD4+ T cell inter￾action is important in human allogeneic responses, and strong 
evidence suggests that such an interaction plays a pathologic 
role in the development of cardiac allograft vasculopathy (18, 
57, 58). Second, human transplant recipients have high num￾bers of alloreactive memory T cells, which are not present in the 
circulation of rodents housed under pathogen-free conditions 
(14). Alloreactive memory T cells act as important mediators of 
rejection and are believed to be more resistant to immune sup￾pression and tolerance induction (15). Because our model repro￾duces both of these phenomena, which are specific to human 
transplantation and commonly overlooked in rodent studies, 
we propose that our data can more accurately predict clinical 
outcomes than can results from conventional mouse models.
The mTOR inhibitor rapamycin was initially believed to act as an 
immunosuppressant by directly blocking proliferation of T lym￾phocytes. Given that mTOR is ubiquitously expressed, recent data 
demonstrating that rapamycin has effects on other cell types is not 
surprising (43, 59). Both human and murine DCs differentiated in 
the presence of rapamycin poorly stimulate allogeneic T cells and 
express low levels of MHC class I, MHC class II, CD80, and CD86 
(45, 46). We provide the first evidence to our knowledge that rapamy￾cin reduces the alloimmunogenicity of human ECs. In contrast to 
DCs, human ECs do not express CD80 or CD86, and rapamycin did 
not alter EC expression of MHC molecules, but did lead to increased 
expression of PD-L1 and PD-L2, associated with reduced allostim￾ulatory capacity. PD-L1 and PD-L2 are inhibitory molecules that 
bind the PD-1 receptor, expressed on activated T cells (60). Upon 
ligation by either PD-L1 or PD-L2, PD-1 antagonizes TCR signal￾ing via recruitment of SHP-1 and SHP-2 phosphatases that inhibit 
phosphorylation of CD3ζ, ZAP70, and PKCθ (51, 61). PD-1 ligation 
also inhibits PI3K activity and downstream activation of Akt (36) 
and mTOR. Together, these signaling events reduce proliferation

and cytokine secretion in activated T cells. In allogeneic heart (62), 
corneal (63), and skin (64) transplant models, blockade or absence 
of PD-1 signaling accelerated rejection, while administration of 
PD-L1.Ig (a PD-1 agonist) reduced cardiac allograft vasculopathy 
(65). Collectively, these data suggest a role for PD-1 ligands in main￾taining allograft tolerance. Thus, the induction of PD-1 ligands on 
allograft ECs, by rapamycin, would be expected to provide protective 
effects by downregulating host alloreactive effector T cells.
Rapamycin inhibits EC secretion of IL-6 in response to IFN-γ
and TNF. IL-6 is a proinflammatory cytokine that has numer￾ous effects on T cell activation, differentiation, and recruitment 
(66–68). In the context of transplantation, increased levels of 
IL-6 correlated with adverse outcomes in human allograft recip￾ients (69, 70). IL-6 is known to inhibit the function of natural 
Tregs (71), as well as the induction of iTregs (52). Given that 
neutralizing IL-6 in such cocultures increases Treg formation (5) 
and that rapa-ECs poorly secrete IL-6, we were surprised to find 
that addition of recombinant IL-6 into cocultures did not alter 
the proportions of FoxP3+ cells. We suspect that the explana￾tion resides in the observation that rapamycin treatment did not 
completely eliminate IL-6 production by the ECs in our culture 
system. Nevertheless, the downregulation of IL-6 release could 
be important in the in vivo setting, where, due to perfusion, 
local cytokine levels may be more limited.

non may further contribute to the protective effects of rapamycin 
in vivo. Overall we conclude that pretreatment of allografts with 
rapamycin downmodulates human T cells responses to allogeneic 
artery grafts in vivo. We envision that our data may be translated 
clinically by including rapamycin in the preservation fluid that is 
flushed or perfused through an explanted organ, or alternatively, 
by treating brain-dead cadaver donors with rapamycin prior to 
organ harvest. However, we caution that such an intervention 
requires additional preclinical study, as rapamycin has also been 
reported to have proinflammatory effects on monocytes, DCs, 
and CD8+ T cells (75, 76). If such effects on leukocytes prove to 
be significant, then rapamycin pretreatment could be coupled to 
pre-transplant depletion of donor leukocytes to eliminate donor 
myeloid and lymphoid cells from allografts.
The data presented in this report raise several interesting ques￾tions. Presently, we do not fully understand the specific signaling 
events downstream of mTOR that control EC alloimmunoge￾nicity. In the cell, mTOR exists in two distinct signaling com￾plexes, known as mTORC1 and mTORC2, which have differing 
upstream inputs and downstream outputs (77). Our data show 
that disruption of mTORC1 signaling (by raptor knockdown) 
caused changes in EC surface molecules similar to those induced 
by rapamycin, and such ECs poorly stimulated allogeneic T cells. 
In addition, we have found that inhibition of both mTORC1 and 
mTORC2 signaling reduces the ability of ECs to secrete IL-6 in 
response to TNF. We are currently investigating whether any 
of the known mTORC1 and mTORC2 targets are involved in 
mediating these effects. Additionally, because blockade of PD-1 
ligands only partially reduced the ability of rapa-ECs to preferen￾tially activate Tregs, it is likely that there are other mechanisms 
behind this observation. Although ligation of GITR on Tregs by 
GITR ligand was initially thought to abrogate their suppressive 
activity (78), recent studies suggest that GITR ligand may act to 
maintain and expand Tregs (79–81). Additionally, the interaction 
between OX40 and OX40 ligand has been shown to be important 
in Treg cell development in the gut (82), and an OX40 agonist 
enhanced Treg proliferation (83). Given that both GITR ligand 
and OX40 ligand are highly expressed on rapa-ECs, we are explor￾ing whether either of these molecules contributes to the ability of 
rapa-ECs to activate Tregs.
Methods
Isolation and culture of human cells. PBMCs were isolated by density centrifuga￾tion of leukapheresis products obtained from anonymized healthy adult vol￾unteers using Lymphocyte Separation Medium (MP Biomedicals). PBMCs 
were stored in liquid nitrogen in 10% DMSO/90% FBS until ready for use.
CD4+ T cells were isolated from PBMCs by positive selection using 
Dynabeads (Invitrogen) magnetic beads and released using DETACHa￾BEAD, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Activated T cells, 
preexisting Tregs, and monocytes were removed by incubating the iso￾lated CD4+ T cells with 5 μg/ml mouse anti-CD14 (BioLegend), anti￾CD25 (eBioscience), and anti–HLA-DR (LB3.1; gift of J. Strominger, 
Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA) antibodies for 20 
minutes, followed by depletion using magnetic pan-mouse IgG beads 
(Invitrogen). Memory CD4+ T cells were isolated following further neg￾ative selection using mouse anti-CD45RA (eBioscience) and pan-mouse 
IgG beads. Isolates were routinely >99% CD4+CD25–HLA-DR–CD45RA–
by flow cytometry. It is important to note that these populations are 
not only devoid of activated memory T cells, but are also depleted of 
CD25-expressing natural Tregs.
In rodent models, infusion of either natural or inducible Tregs 
into recipients prior to transplantation prevented rejection of 
allografts (72). In humans, increased numbers of Tregs are found 
in the circulation and within allografts of recipients that have 
achieved immunosuppression-free graft survival (operational 
tolerance) (1, 73, 74). We found that allogeneic T cells activated 
by rapa-ECs contained a higher percentage of suppressive CD4+
CD25hiCD127loFoxP3+ T cells, and such cells displayed signifi￾cant demethylation of the TSDR within the FOXP3 locus. While 
the increase in FoxP3+ cells activated by rapa-ECs compared with 
control ECs (Figure 4B) may appear modest, it is not known how 
many of these FoxP3+ cells actually represent suppressive Tregs, 
since conventional human T cells transiently express FoxP3 upon 
activation. However, we demonstrate that this increase is function￾ally significant, as the CD25+ T cell pool primed by rapa-EC was far 
more suppressive than control, especially at lower Treg/responder 
ratios (Figure 5E). Since our highly purified CD4+ memory T cells 
are depleted of preexisting CD25+ T cells, a subpopulation that 
in humans contains natural Tregs, one may consider the FoxP3+
cells induced by rapa-ECs as iTregs. The fundamental effect of 
rapamycin treatment appears to be a loss of the capacity of rapa￾ECs to activate effector cells, resulting in an increase in the ratio 
of regulatory to effector T cell populations. We demonstrate that 
PD-1 ligands partially contribute to this effect, as their blockade 
reduces the preferential activation of CD25+FoxP3+ cells by rapa￾ECs. Importantly, we show that shRNA knockdown of mTOR in 
ECs phenocopies the increased ability of rapa-ECs to favor Treg 
activation, thereby ruling out the possibility that carryover of 
rapamycin may be directly inducing Tregs. The enhanced ability 
of rapamycin-treated allograft ECs to activate Tregs would be ben￾eficial in the context of transplantation by reducing rejection and 
promoting tolerance.
Last, using a human-mouse chimeric model of allograft artery 
rejection, we observed that pretreatment of arterial allografts with 
rapamycin diminished T cell–mediated graft injury, as assessed by 
T cell intimal infiltration and intimal expansion. These protective 
effects coincided with increased expression of PD-L1 and PD-L2 
on treated graft ECs. The induced expression of PD-1 ligands 
was detectable 10 days after re-transplant, suggesting durability 
of this response. We cannot rule out that the T cells present in 
the host animal, perhaps through production of IFN-γ, contrib￾uted to this prolonged expression; however, rapamycin-inducible 
expression was durable in cultured ECs and greater than that 
induced by IFN-γ, and little if any expression was observed in 
grafts not pretreated with rapamycin, despite a greater number 
of infiltrating T cells. To elucidate the role of these molecules, 
we serologically blocked PD-1 in animals transplanted with 
rapamycin-pretreated grafts and found that the resulting vessels 
had increased areas and intima sizes, as well as more infiltrating 
intimal T cells when compared with animals treated with an iso￾type control. These data suggest that rapamycin-induced PD-1 
ligands contribute to the protection of rapamycin-pretreated 
grafts against immune-mediated rejection. Based on our data 
with cultured ECs, we speculate that this induced expression 
of PD-1 ligands on graft ECs acts to reduce their alloimmuno￾genicity and may lead to preferential activation of Tregs in vivo. 
In addition, we have recently shown that serological neutraliza￾tion of IL-6 diminishes intimal expansion in a similar model of 
artery allograft rejection (5). Given that rapamycin reduces IL-6 
production by cultured ECs, it is possible that such a phenome-

surface-stained cells were then permeabilized and restained using a FoxP3 
Staining Kit (eBioscience), according to the manufacturer’s instruc￾tions, with anti–human FoxP3-APC (clone PCH101; eBioscience). For 
intracellular cytokine staining, T cells cocultured with allogeneic ECs for 
6 days were stimulated for 6 hours with 40 ng/ml PMA and 2 μM ionomy￾cin in the presence of Brefeldin A (eBioscience). Stimulated T cells were sur￾face stained with anti–human CD4, CD25, CD127 fluorescent antibodies, 
then permeabilized using FoxP3 Staining Kit and stained with FoxP3-APC 
and IL-17–FITC (eBioscience), IL-10–FITC (eBioscience), IFN-γ–FITC 
(eBioscience), or TGF-β/LAP–FITC (BioLegend). To ensure antibodies were 
functional, positive staining was analyzed in the following controls: CD14+
monocytes stimulated with LPS (IL-10), CD4+ T cells stimulated by MHC 
II+ ECs (IFN-γ and IL-17), and CD4+ T cells stimulated with anti-CD3 and 
anti-CD28 in the presence of IL-2 (LAP). All stained cells were analyzed on 
an LSR II (BD Biosciences) using FlowJo software (Tree Star).
In vitro suppression assays. The frequency of T cells that recognize alloge￾neic cells is too limited to generate significant numbers of responder cells 
in a primary culture. Therefore, to determine whether ECs could gener￾ate iTregs, we first modified EC stimulators to serve as polyclonal acti￾vators of T cell responses by retroviral transduction of the extracellular 
domain of Fcγ receptor IIA (CD32), as previously described (50). CD32+
ECs were treated with vehicle (DMSO) or rapamycin and plated into 
24-well plates, as described above. Treated ECs were then loaded with 
2.5 μg/ml anti-CD3 (OKT3; BioLegend) for 4 hours and washed 3 times 
with RPMI complete medium. 2 × 106 allogeneic memory CD4+ T cells 
were added to each well. After 72 hours of stimulation, T cells were col￾lected, washed, stained with CD4-FITC (Beckman Coulter) and CD25-APC 
(BD Biosciences), and sorted on a FACSAria (BD Biosciences) to isolate 
total CD4+CD25+ or CD4+CD25hi populations. Sorted populations were 
then added into cocultures of freshly isolated CFSE-labeled CD4+ memory 
T cells and untreated OKT3-loaded ECs at indicated suppressor/responder 
ratios. Proliferation of CFSE-labeled responder T cells was assessed after 
4 days via CFSE dilution, a time point at which responder cells that had 
divided could be readily distinguished from both labeled cells that had 
not divided and unlabeled Tregs. Percent suppression was calculated as 
follows: ([proliferation of responders alone – proliferation of responders 
with Tregs]/proliferation of responders alone) × 100).
qRT-PCR analysis. ECs treated with rapamycin for up to 72 hours were 
collected at various time points by trypsinization, lysed, and used to make 
cDNA using a Cells-to-CT kit (Ambion), according to the manufacturer’s 
instructions. For T cell experiments, memory CD4+ T cells stimulated by 
allogeneic ECs for 72 hours were collected, washed, stained with fluorescent 
antibodies, and FACS sorted for CD4+CD25+ cells. cDNA was made from 
these cells using the Cells-to-CT kit. All qRT-PCR reactions were assem￾bled with TaqMan 2× PCR Master Mix and predeveloped gene expression 
probes from Applied Biosystems. Samples were analyzed on a CFX96 Real￾Time system using CFX Manager Software (Bio-Rad). Gene expression lev￾els were normalized to GAPDH or CD3, as indicated. All Taqman probes 
were purchased from Applied Biosystems: GAPDH (Hs99999905_m1), CD3 
(Hs00167894_m1), FoxP3 (Hs01085834_m1), PD-L1 (Hs01125301_m1), 
PD-L2 (Hs00228839_m1), GRAIL (Hs00226053_m1), CBL-B (Hs00180288_
m1), and ITCH (Hs00395201_m1).
shRNA knockdown of mTOR, raptor, and rictor. mTOR, raptor, or rictor was 
silenced in ECs using lentivirus-mediated transduction of shRNA. To gener￾ate lentivirus, plasmids encoding mTOR shRNA (mTOR_2 shRNA), raptor 
shRNA (raptor_2 shRNA), rictor shRNA (rictor_1 shRNA), or control GFP 
shRNA (pLKO.1 GFP shRNA) were transfected into 293T cells together 
with the CMV-dR8.2 packaging and CMV-VSVG envelope plasmids, using 
Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instruc￾tions. Virus containing supernatants was collected at 48 and 72 hours 
Human ECs were isolated from umbilical cords following collagenase 
digestion and serially cultured on 0.1% gelatin-coated tissue culture plates 
in M199 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 20% FBS, l-glutamine (2 mM), 
penicillin (100 U/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), 0.1% EC growth supple￾ment (Collaborative Biomedical Research), and porcine heparin (100 μg/ml; 
Sigma-Aldrich). EC cultures were used at passage levels 2–5, at which time 
the cultured cells are uniformly positive for the EC marker CD31 and are 
devoid of CD45+ contaminating leukocytes.
In vitro rapamycin treatment. ECs retrovirally transduced to express CIITA 
were grown on 10-cm gelatin-coated plates and allowed to reach conflu￾ence. Post-confluent ECs were treated with varying doses (up to 100 ng/ml) 
of rapamycin (Sigma-Aldrich) or vehicle (DMSO) for up to 72 hours. Fresh 
medium with rapamycin was added every 24 hours. Vehicle- and rapamy￾cin-treated ECs were then washed 3 times with HBSS, collected by trypsi￾nization, washed an additional 3 times with HBSS, and plated into 24-well 
plates. Viable (assessed by Trypan blue staining) control ECs and rapa-ECs 
were counted to ensure that equal numbers of cells were plated. In other 
experiments, post-confluent ECs grown in 10-cm plates were treated with 
rapamycin and 50 ng/ml recombinant human IFN-γ simultaneously for 72 
hours, then plated as above.
T cell activation in vitro. CD4+ memory T cell activation by allogeneic ECs 
requires recognition of non-self MHC class II molecules, principally HLA￾DR, on the ECs. To reinduce EC expression of MHC class II, which is lost 
on serially cultured cells, ECs were retrovirally transduced with the CIITA 
transactivator, as previously described (50). In other experiments, expres￾sion was restored by treating ECs with 50 ng/ml recombinant human IFN-γ
(Invitrogen) for 72 hours. For in vitro stimulation, MHC class II+ ECs were 
washed 3 times with HBSS, plated into gelatin-coated 24-well plates, and 
allowed to reach confluence. 2 × 106 allogeneic memory CD4+ T cells were 
added to each well in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen), supplemented with 10% FBS, 
l-glutamine (2 mM), penicillin (100 U/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). 
To assess proliferation, T cells were labeled with 250 nM CFSE (Molecular 
Probes, Invitrogen) prior to coculture. Proliferation was assessed on day 7 via 
CFSE dilution, as previously described (84). In some experiments, recombi￾nant human IL-6 (BioLegend) or 10 μg/ml of blocking antibodies to PD-L1 
and PD-L2 (BioLegend) was added into allogeneic cocultures.
For restimulation experiments, unlabeled memory CD4+ T cells were 
cocultured with MHC class II+ allogeneic control ECs or rapa-ECs for 
72 hours, collected, washed 3 times in HBSS, and rested for 3 days in the 
presence of 10 U/ml recombinant human IL-2 (Invitrogen), which serves 
as a survival factor. Recovered T cells were washed in HBSS, labeled with 
250 nM CFSE, and restimulated with either fresh MHC class II+ ECs from 
the same donor as used in primary stimulation or from third-party donors. 
Proliferation was assessed (via CFSE dilution) at day 3 for T cells restim￾ulated by matched EC donors and day 5 for T cells restimulated by third￾party EC donors. In some experiments, blocking antibodies (30 μg/ml) 
to HLA-DR or isotype control IgG (30 μg/ml) were added to the primary 
stimulation cocultures.
FACS analysis. To analyze ECs, cells were suspended with trypsin-ver￾sene, washed in PBS, and stained (on ice) in PBS supplemented with 1% 
BSA with antibodies against human HLA-A,B,C–FITC, HLA-DR–FITC, or 
CD40-PE (all from Beckman Coulter), LFA-3–PE, PD-L1–PE, or PD-L2–PE 
(all from BD Biosciences), OX40 ligand–PE or GITR ligand–PE (from R&D 
Systems), or ICOS ligand–PE (from BioLegend).
To analyze effects on T cells, cells were collected from cocultures via vig￾orous pipetting, washed in PBS, and stained (on ice) in PBS supplemented 
with 1% BSA with antibodies against human CD4-FITC or –Pacific blue, 
or CD25-PE (from BD Biosciences) or CD127–PerCP-Cy5.5 (from eBio￾science). For FoxP3 staining, T cells were first stained with anti–human 
CD4, CD25, CD127 fluorescent antibodies and washed in PBS. These

were anesthetized, and the treated human arterial grafts, along with a 1- to 
2-mm cuff of mouse aorta on each end, were harvested and re-transplanted 
into a second SCID/beige mouse previously reconstituted with PBMCs 
allogeneic to the arterial graft. After 10–21 days, these secondary recipients 
were anesthetized, and arterial grafts were perfused with normal saline and 
excised before death. Grafts were snap frozen in optimal cutting temper￾ature (OCT) compound (Sakura Finetek). Serial 5-μm transverse sections 
were cut for morphometric and immunofluorescence analysis.
For adoptive transfer of human T cells, SCID/beige mice were given 
an intraperitoneal injection of 3 × 108 human PBMCs (allogeneic to the 
artery graft) from a healthy adult volunteer donor 10–14 days prior to 
artery implantation. As previously described, only T and B lymphocytes 
are successfully engrafted by this procedure, and only T cells appear in the 
circulation (53, 55). Engraftment was assessed 7 days after PBMC admin￾istration via flow cytometry analysis of heparinized blood, collected by 
retro-orbital puncture, stained with FITC-conjugated anti-human CD3 
(Beckman Coulter) and PE-conjugated anti-mouse CD45 (BD Biosciences). 
Engraftment was considered successful when a distinct population of 
human CD3+ cells (typically ranging from 0.5% to 10% of the total mono￾nuclear cell population) was observed. In PD-1 blockade experiments, we 
observed that injection of intact neutralizing PD-1 antibodies (BioXCell, 
clone J116) depleted mice of circulating human T cells. To circumvent this 
problem, we prepared F(ab′)2 fragments from this antibody and confirmed 
that these fragments were functional in vitro in cocultures of CD4+ mem￾ory T cells with rapa-ECs and no longer depleted T cells in vivo. F(ab′)2
fragments were prepared using a F(ab′)2 preparation kit (Thermo Scien￾tific) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For PD-1 blockade, 
mice with rapamycin-pretreated grafts were injected subcutaneously with 
a neutralizing PD-1 F(ab′)2 fragment or an irrelevant IgG1 F(ab′)2 fragment 
(BioXCell, MOPC-21), starting with a 200-μg loading dose the day before 
re-transplant and then a subsequent dose of 100 μg 3 times per week. 
Grafts were harvested 14 days after re-transplant.
Histology and immunofluorescence microscopy. Five-micrometer cross sec￾tions of artery grafts were stained with Elastica–van Gieson (EVG) and 
used for morphometric analysis. Total vessel area (determined as the 
area bound by the external elastic lamina and the lumen), mean intimal 
area (determined as the area bound by the internal elastic lamina and the 
lumen), and luminal area were quantified using ImageJ software (NIH).
For immunofluorescence microscopy, serial sections were stained with 
purified mouse anti–human PD-L1 and PD-L2 antibodies (eBioscience) 
and an Alexa Fluor 546–conjugated donkey anti-mouse secondary anti￾body (Invitrogen). ECs were stained with biotinylated Ulex europaeus agglu￾tinin I (Ulex, Vector Laboratories) and Alexa Fluor 488–conjugated avidin 
(Invitrogen). Immunofluorescence intensity of PD-L1 and PD-L2 staining 
was quantified using ImageJ by first highlighting Ulex-positive cells and then 
determining the mean pixel intensity, in the red channel, on highlighted 
cells. All fluorescence intensity values were normalized to those obtained 
from vehicle-treated grafts. Graft-infiltrating T cells were stained with puri￾fied rabbit anti-human CD3 (Dako) and an Alexa Fluor 546–conjugated 
donkey anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Invitrogen). Immunofluorescence 
images were acquired with an Axiovert 200M fluorescence microscope 
(Zeiss) equipped with an ORCA-AG digital camera (Hamamatsu) using 
Volocity software (PerkinElmer). An FITC filter was used to detect Alexa 
Fluor 488–stained cells, and a tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate filter 
was used to detect Alexa Fluor 594–stained cells. Total numbers of intimal 
CD3+ T cells were determined in 3 cross sections per graft.
Statistics. All data are expressed as mean ± SEM. Statistical comparisons 
were made using Student’s t test with the Bonferroni correction as appro￾priate. In all experiments, unless otherwise stated, P values of 0.05 or less 
were considered statistically significant.
after transfection and used to infect ECs in the presence of 8 μg/ml Poly￾brene. Following two rounds of infection, transduced cells were selected 
via puromycin resistance and used for experiments 5 days after infection. 
Knockdown was confirmed with Western blot analysis. mTOR_2 shRNA 
(85) (Addgene plasmid 1856), rictor_1 shRNA (85) (Addgene plasmid 1853), 
raptor_2 shRNA (85) (Addgene plasmid 1858), and pLKO.1 GFP shRNA 
(Addgene plasmid 30323) were deposited by David Sabatini (Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA); CMV-dR8.2 and 
CMV-VSVG (Addgene plasmid 8455 and 8454) were deposited by Robert 
Weinberg (Massachusetts Institute of Technology).
FoxP3 locus methylation analysis. FoxP3 locus methylation analysis was 
performed as previously described (27). Briefly, human CD4+ memory 
T cells stimulated by rapa-ECs were stained with fluorescent antibodies and 
sorted on the basis of high expression of CD25 and low/negative expression 
of CD127. Natural Tregs were sorted (based on the same markers) from 
unstimulated CD4+ T cells and served as positive control. Genomic DNA 
was isolated from sorted CD4+CD25hiCD127lo T cells using DNeasy Blood 
and Tissue Kit (QIAGEN). Sodium bisulfite treatment was performed 
on purified genomic DNA using EpiTect Bisulfite Kit (QIAGEN). Bisul￾fite-treated DNA was PCR amplified using the following primers: p-5′-
TGTTTGGGGGTAGAGGATTT-3′ and o-5′-TATCACCCCACCTAAAC￾CAA-3′. Amplified DNA product was gel purified and sequenced directly. 
Trace files were interpreted using 4Peaks software (Mekentosj).
Immunoblotting. ECs cultured in 6-well plates were washed with ice-cold 
PBS and lysed directly by addition of NP40 lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 
10% glycerol, 125 mM NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 5.3 mM NaF, 1 mM orthova￾nadate, and 1 mg/ml protease inhibitor mixture [Roche]). EC lysates were 
frozen, thawed on ice, and cleared by centrifugation at 12,000 g for 10 min￾utes. The protein concentration of each lysate was determined using DC 
Protein Assay (Bio-Rad), and equal amounts of protein from each sample 
were boiled at 95°C in SDS sample buffer for 10 minutes. Samples were 
separated by electrophoresis in a 10% SDS-PAGE gel, and proteins were 
transferred to PVDF membrane (Millipore) at 100 V for 1 hour at 4°C. 
Following blocking in TBST containing 5% BSA, membranes were incu￾bated overnight at 4°C with anti-mTOR, anti-rictor, anti-raptor, anti–phos￾pho-S6K1, or anti-actin antibodies (all from Cell Signaling Technology). 
Bound antibodies were detected with HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse or 
goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laborato￾ries Inc.) and SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce).
ELISA. Supernatants from EC–T cell cocultures were collected after 24 
hours of stimulation and analyzed by ELISA (eBioscience) for IL-2 and 
IFN-γ, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For IL-6 experiments, 
ECs were treated with rapamycin (10 ng/ml) for 2 hours and then treated 
with 50 ng/ml IFN-γ or 1 ng/ml TNF-α (R&D), in the continued presence 
of rapamycin. Supernatant was collected after 24 hours and analyzed by 
ELISA (eBioscience) for IL-6.
In vivo rapamycin treatment. Rapamycin (Sirolimus, Calbiochem) was 
diluted in ethanol and mixed with an equal volume of Cremophor EL 
(Sigma-Aldrich). This mixture was dissolved in Dulbecco’s PBS at a final 
volume of 2 ml/mouse and administered via intraperitoneal injection. Mice 
were injected with 3 mg/kg sirolimus every 24 hours for 3 days. Control mice 
were injected with a mixture containing ethanol and Cremophor EL in PBS.
Arterial transplantation. Arterial transplantation was performed as previ￾ously described (53). Briefly, 1- to 3-mm segments of human artery were 
interposed into the infrarenal aortae of female C.B-17 SCID/beige mice 
(Taconic) by end-to-end anastomosis and left to heal for 30 days. Adjacent 
segments of human artery were transplanted into 2–5 mice for each experi￾ment, and data from individual experiments were pooled for analysis. After 
30 days, transplanted mice with healed-in grafts were treated with vehicle 
or rapamycin (as described above) for 72 hours. Following treatment, mice
