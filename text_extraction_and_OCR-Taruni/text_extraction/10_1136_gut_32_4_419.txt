Abstract
Twelve of 178 (7%) liver transplant patients
underwent endoscopic retrograde cholangio￾pancreatography (ERCP) after transplantation.
The indications for ERCP were persistent or
late onset cholestasis, recurrent cholangitis,
and suspected biliary leaks or strictures. The
time between transplantation and ERCP
ranged from 44 to 330 days (median 153 days).
Biliary complications diagnosed by ERCP in￾cluded biliary sludge in the form of casts,
calculi, or debris (n=7); bile leaks (n=2); a
biliary stricture (n=l), and complete biliary
obstruction (n=l). One patient had a normal
cholangiogram after transplantation. Biliary
sludge was detected by ultrasound before
ERCP in only one ofsix patients. Eight patients
underwent endoscopic papillotomy, followed
by clearance of biliary sludge in four and
dilatation of a biliary stricture in one. Two
patients bled after papillotomy but neither
required surgical intervention. At a median
follow up of 1.2 years (range 0*5-2.8 years),
nine patients are well and three have died.
ERCP provides both accurate diagnosis of
biliary complications after liver transplanta￾tion and treatment that obviates the need for
additional surgery in selected patients.
In the immunosuppressed patient after liver
transplantation, biliary complications are

associated with a high mortality if they are not
diagnosed and treated promptly.' Furthermore,
the clinical features and laboratory data
associated with biliary complications may be
similar to those of acute or chronic rejection,
chronic sepsis, or cytomegalovirus infection.
Hence, diagnostic imaging of the biliary tract is
often required after liver transplantation.
Although there are data on the roles of ultra￾sound, computed tomography, and percuta￾neous transhepatic cholangiography after trans￾plantation,2 little attention has been paid to the
value of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopan￾creatography (ERCP). In this report the diag￾nostic and therapeutic roles of ERCP in the
postoperative management of liver transplant
recipients are assessed.
Patients and methods
Between 19 January 1982 and 1 November 1988
178 patients received 206 orthotopic liver trans￾plants at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Bir￾mingham. The techniques of donor hepatectomy
and graft implantation have been described
elsewhere.3 Twenty one patients received a
second and three patients a third transplant.
There were 31 early postoperative deaths. Eighty
one patients received immunosuppression with
combination cyclosporin-prednisolone treat￾ment and 66 received additional azathioprine.
Twelve of the 178 (7%) patients underwent
ERCP after transplantation and their details are
shown in the Table. In seven of the 12 patients
bile duct reconstruction was accomplished by
the gall bladder conduit technique4 in which the
donor gall bladder is used as a conduit with a
proximal anastomosis between Hartmann's
pouch and the donor common bile duct and a
distal anastomosis between the fundus of the gall
bladder and the recipient common bile duct
(Fig 1A). In the remaining five patients, biliary
reconstruction was accomplished by the duct to
duct technique using an end to end choledocho￾choledochostomy (Fig 1B) with the long limb of
a T tube brought out through a choledochotomy
in the recipient's common bile duct.
INDICATIONS FOR ERCP
The main clinical indication for ERCP was
cholestasis. In three patients, cholestasis had
persisted since transplantation but in four it was

been found at T tube cholangiography three
months after transplantation, and attempts at
percutaneous dilatation via the T tube track had

The interval between transplantation and
ERCP ranged from 44 to 330 days (median 153
days). The time to ERCP in the patients with late
onset cholestasis ranged from 172 to 330 days
(median 262 days), significantly longer than in
the remaining eight patients (p<005).
ERCP was performed once in five patients,
twice in four patients, three times in two
patients, and five times in one patient. All
patients received antibiotic prophylaxis with
intravenous cefuroxime one hour before ERCP
and at four and 24 hours after the procedure.
Patients were sedated with intravenous
diazepam for the investigation and also received
intravenous hyoscine butylbromide during the
procedure to reduce duodenal peristalsis.
Results
ERCP FINDINGS
Cholangiography was successful in all 12
patients. Seven patients had evidence of sludge
in the biliary tree in the form of casts, calculi, or
debris. Biliary casts were detected in three
patients - one with late onset cholestasis, one
with persistent cholestasis, and one with recur￾rent cholangitis. The casts were at the level of the
recipient common bile duct in two patients and
the donor common bile duct in one (Fig 2).
Discrete calculi were detected in three patients
(two with late onset cholestasis and one with
persistent cholestasis). These were at the level of
the recipient common bile duct in one patient
and the donor common bile duct in two (Fig 3).
One patient with recurrent cholangitis had
ERCP appearances consistent with a collection
of biliary debris in the gall bladder conduit. Six
of the seven patients with cholangiographic
evidence of biliary sludge had ultrasound
examination of the biliary tree performed before
ERCP and in only one was sludge detected.

None of the patients had ultrasonic evidence of
biliary dilatation.
The presence of a biliary leak was confirmed at
ERCP in two patients and the location of the leak
was defined accurately (Fig 4). The presence of a
biliary stricture was confirmed in one patient
(Fig 5). One patient with persistent cholestasis
had complete obstruction to the flow of contrast
proximal to the gall bladder conduit (Fig 6) and a
patient with late onset cholestasis had a normal
cholangiogram after transplant (Fig 7).
ENDOSCOPIC INTERVENTION
Eight patients underwent endoscopic papil￾lotomy, including all seven patients with biliary
sludge. Papillotomy was followed by successful
clearance of sludge from the biliary tract in four
patients (two with calculi and two with casts)
using a combination of transendoscopic balloon
extraction catheters and Dormia baskets. All
four patients had had a duct to duct biliary
reconstruction. In contrast, attempted clearance
of biliary sludge was unsuccessful in the three
patients (one with casts, one with calculi, and
one with debris) who had had a gall bladder
conduit biliary reconstruction. Two patients
with sludge had a nasobiliary tube inserted after
papillotomy to flush the biliary tree with normal
saline. The patient found to have a biliary
stricture underwent attempted dilatation after
papillotomy using graduated transendoscopic
bougies to 11 FG passed across the stricture over
a teflon coated coaxial guide wire.
Two patients bled after papillotomy and
required transfusion of two and four units of
blood. Neither patient required surgical inter￾vention.
Histological examination of the concretions
removed from one patient showed fibrin/cellular
debris impregnated with bacteria.
OUTCOME
All 12 patients have been followed up for a
median of 1 2 years (range 05-2-8 years) after
transplantation. Based on the ERCP findings,
three patients underwent laparotomy and
exploration of the biliary tract The patient with
complete obstruction to the flow of contrast
proximal to the gall bladder conduit had two
casts removed from the donor common bile duct
13 days after ERCP and one patient, in whom
attempted endoscopic clearance of calculi was
unsuccessful, had dense sludge removed from
the gall bladder conduit 16 days after ERCP.
Unfortunately, biliary sludge recurred in the
latter patient affecting both the intra- and extra￾hepatic biliary tree and she underwent another
transplant eight months after ERCP. The patient
with a biliary stricture continued to suffer recur￾rent cholangitis despite attempted endoscopic

Two other patients in this series underwent
further transplantation for chronic rejection and
vanishing bile duct syndrome at 12 and 15
months. Nine patients are alive and well and
three have died - one from recurrent hepatoma
12 months after transplantation, one from a
cardiac arrest seven months after transplanta￾tion, and the third from uncontrolled sepsis
three months after retransplantation.
Discussion
Despite improvements in surgical technique,
biliary tract complications continue to occur in
about 13% of liver transplant recipients.' This
report shows the value of ERCP in their
diagnosis and treatment.
Biliary sludge (in the form of casts, calculi, or
debris) was the commonest finding at ERCP,
occurring in seven of the 12 patients. There was
no characteristic indication for ERCP in this
subgroup nor was the finding of biliary sludge
associated with a particular type of biliary recon￾struction. The aetiology of biliary sludge after
transplantation is unclear, though factors such as
epithelial debris after rejection, ischaemia,
sepsis, and the constituents and flow characteris￾tics of bile are thought to be important.5 Like￾wise, the factors that determine whether sludge
occurs in the form of biliary casts, calculi, or
debris remain unclear.
Only one patient in our series had biliary
sludge diagnosed ultrasonically before ERCP
and, furthermore, bile duct dilatation was not
detected at ultrasound in this subgroup. These
data add to the increasing evidence that ultra￾sound is insensitive as a screening test for the
early detection of biliary tract complications
after liver transplantation. In a recent compara￾tive study in 50 liver transplant patients with
biliary complications diagnosed by percutaneous
transhepatic cholangiography, Zajko et al6 found
that ultrasound had a sensitivity of only 46%.
Letourneau et afi have shown that biliary
obstruction after transplantation can be detected
by computed tomography. However, the
accuracy of this compared with direct cholangio￾graphy in the liver transplant patient has not
been formally assessed.
Biliary leaks were diagnosed at ERCP in two
patients, and their type and location were
delineated accurately. Although bile collections
suggestive of a leak from the biliary tree can be
detected by ultrasound or computed tomography
and fine needle aspiration,2 accurate diagnosis
requires direct cholangiography, which in turn
provides valuable information about the under￾lying aetiology, the likely clinical outcome and
the treatment required. The most frequent site
of bile leakage after transplantation is the T tube
choledochotomy, as shown in one of our
patients. Most of these leaks are small and can be
effectively treated by simple drainage. Anasto￾motic leaks, as in our second patient, are more
serious and often require surgical repair.' Non￾anastomotic leaks are a grave finding, usually
occur in the hilar region, and result from bile
duct necrosis secondary to hepatic artery
thrombosis.8
To our knowledge, this is the first report of the
use of endoscopic papillotomy in the manage￾422

ment of biliary complications after liver trans￾plantation. The finding of biliary sludge was the
main indication for papillotomy, which then
allowed clearance of calculi and casts from the
bile duct in four of seven patients, obviating the
need for additional surgery. It is of interest that
the type of biliary reconstruction had a major
impact on the endoscopist's ability to achieve
bile duct clearance, with a high probability of
success in patients who had a duct to duct recon￾struction but not in those with a gall bladder
conduit reconstruction. It is our experience that
passage of transendoscopic catheters and baskets
is facilitated by the relatively straight course of
the biliary tree after duct to duct reconstruction
but hindered by the tortuosity of the biliary tree
after gall bladder conduit reconstruction. With
the latter reconstruction it usually proved dif￾ficult to get out of the wide conduit into the
narrow ostium of the donor common bile duct.
Finally, no unexpected complications were
encountered after ERCP in our patients.
