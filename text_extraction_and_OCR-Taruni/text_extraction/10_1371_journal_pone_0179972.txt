Abstract
Bone marrow-mesenchymal stem cell (BM-MSC) therapy improves the recovery of cardiac
function after myocardial infarction (MI); however, the underlying molecular mechanisms
are not completely understood. Recent studies have shown that microRNAs (miRNAs) mod￾ulate the pathophysiology of cardiovascular diseases. Here, we investigated the mecha￾nisms underlying the effects of BM-MSC-derived paracrine factors and cardiac miRNAs on
myocardial regeneration after MI. In our study, MI was induced by permanent ligation of the
left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery. BM-MSCs transplanted in infarcted rats sig￾nificantly downregulated the expression of miRNA-23a and miRNA-92a and inhibited apo￾ptosis in the myocardium. An in vitro experiment showed that supernatant from BM-MSCs
cultured under hypoxia contained higher levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)
than that from BM-MSCs under normoxia. In addition, inhibition of miRNA-23a and miRNA￾92a reduced cardiac apoptosis. Moreover, the VEGF-containing BM-MSC supernatant
inhibited miRNA-23a and miRNA-92a expression and reduced apoptotic signaling in cardio￾myocytes under hypoxia. These effects were inhibited when the supernatant was treated
with neutralizing antibodies against VEGF. Our results indicate that the paracrine factor,
VEGF, derived from transplanted BM-MSCs, regulated the expression of miRNAs such as
miRNA-23a and miRNA-92a and exerted anti-apoptotic effects in cardiomyocytes after MI.
Introduction
Although the mortality rate of myocardial infarction (MI) has much improved since rapid
revascularization of occluded coronary arteries became common practice, MI remains to be

one of the leading causes of death and chronic heart failure [1]. Stem cell therapy has been rec￾ognized as a promising treatment option to restore damaged myocardium after MI [2, 3]. So
far, various types of stem cells including mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) [4, 5], cardiac stem
cells [6], bone marrow (BM) stem cells [7], and amniotic stem cells [8] have been reported to
reduce infarct size and improve myocardial function after MI; however, mechanisms underly￾ing the effects of stem cell therapies remain unclear.
Paracrine actions of stem cell-derived factors have been recognized as a more important
mechanism than direct regeneration of myocardium by the implanted stem cells [9]. MSC
therapy has been reported to reduce infarct size through the anti-apoptotic effects of paracrine
factors derived from BM-MSCs [10, 11]. We have also reported that amniotic stem cell therapy
reduced infarct size and improved cardiac function by reducing apoptosis in infarct myocar￾dium through paracrine actions of stem cell-derived factors [12].
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that bind to complementary sequences
on mRNAs and regulate many biological processes. Many miRNAs are known to be involved
in the pathophysiology of various cardiac diseases and the repair and regeneration of cardiac
tissues [13]. In recent studies, miRNAs, including miRNA-15b [14], miRNA-34a [15],
miRNA-92a [16], and miRNA-320 [17] have been reported to be involved in the regulation of
cardiomyocyte apoptosis after MI. Given that paracrine factors exert anti-apoptotic effects,
there may be a link between the actions of paracrine factors from transplanted stem cells and
the roles of miRNAs in stem cell therapies for MI. In addition, even though a few potential
mechanisms have been proposed for beneficial effects of stem cell therapies [18], there have
been no reports related to the role of miRNAs in paracrine effect of transplanted MSC.
Therefore, we hypothesized that reductions in apoptosis and fibrosis of the myocardium in
MI after MSC therapy could be associated with the regulation of cardiac miRNA by MSC￾released paracrine factors. In this study, we sought to confirm the therapeutic effect of MSCs
in a rat model of MI, screened in vitro MSC-released paracrine factors under hypoxic condi￾tions, and described cardiac miRNA regulation by MSC-released paracrine factors.
Materials and methods
Animals
All experimental procedures were performed in accordance with the ARRIVE guidelines for
research [19], and the Hanyang University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee
approved all protocols (2015-0054A). Male Sprague-Dawley rats (Koatech, Kyungki-do, South
Korea), eight weeks old and weighing 200–250 g, were used in this experiment. The animals
were maintained in the Hanyang University Medical School Animal Experiment Center and
were kept in a specific pathogen-free facility at a controlled temperature (23 ± 2˚C) and
humidity (55 ± 5%) with a 12 h artificial light-dark cycle.
Myocardial infarction and cell transplantation
Myocardial infarction (MI) was induced by permanent ligation of the left anterior descending
(LAD) coronary artery as previously described [12, 20, 21]. In order to induce MI, rats were
anesthetized with a cocktail of tiletamine and zolazepam (Zoletil 100, Virbac, France; dosage
40 mg/kg, i.p.). The chest was opened via lateral thoracotomy, and the heart was exposed using
a left anterior thoracotomy. The LAD was ligated with 6–0 polypropylene (Prolene 1; Ethi￾con, Hamburg, Germany) just below the tip of the left auricle. Ten days after inducing the MI,
the rats were randomly divided into two groups (n = 4–5). After anesthesia, one group was
intra-myocardial injected with BM-MSCs (PT-2501; Lonza, Walkersville, MD, USA) from pas￾sage 4 to 6 while the other group received a saline injection. Sham-operated rats were subjected

to similar surgical procedures. Cyclosporin A (5 mg/kg/day i.p., CIPOL1, Chong Kun Dang,
Seoul, Korea) was administered from 2 days pre-transplantation until sacrifice [22]. To trace
the fate of the transplanted cells, the BM-MSCs were labeled with chloromethyl-benzamido￾dialkylcarbocyanine (Cell Tracker™: CM-DiI; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, USA), according
to the manufacturer’s protocol [23]. A total of 1 million BM-MSCs were resuspended in 100 μl
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; WELGENE, Gyeongsangbuk-do, South Korea) and trans￾planted intramuscularly at three different sites 2 mm apart from the border towards the center
of the infarct and from the lateral left ventricle to the septum. Penicillin (500,000 U/ml i.p.,
Penicillin G potassium, Kun Wha Pharmaceutical Co., Seoul, Korea) was administered after
each procedure. Rats were sacrificed under anesthesia with a cocktail of tiletamine and zolaze￾pam (40 mg/kg, i.p.) at 3 days or 4 weeks after treatment with BM-MSCs or saline. Heart tis￾sues including the infarct zone and border zone were collected and either snap-frozen in
liquid nitrogen or fixed in 10% formalin solution (pH 7.4).
Masson’s trichrome staining and TUNEL assay
For histopathology, fixed heart tissues were embedded in paraffin, and cut into 4 μm sections.
Collagen in myocardium sections was stained using the Masson’s trichrome method. The
infarct area was measured as the percent ratio (%) of the injured area, divided by the whole
myocardium area in each rat [8]. Apoptotic cells in myocardium sections were stained using a
terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay with an In Situ
Cell Death Detection kit (Roche, Mannheim, Germany). The stained sections were photo￾graphed using a light microscope (Leica DM 4000B). Apoptotic nuclei were counted in order
to calculate the apoptotic index (number of labeled nuclei / number of total nuclei) in ran￾domly selected five fields from the border zone of each slide [24].
Isolation and culture of neonatal rat cardiomyocytes
Primary cultures of the cardiomyocytes were established as described previously [25]. In brief,
two-days old neonatal rats were anesthetized by inhalation with isoflurane. Heart tissues were
quickly cut, and then the ventricles were obtained and washed with PBS. Subsequently, the
ventricles were cut into small fragments and digested repeatedly in Hanks’ balanced salt solu￾tion (HBSS; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) (without Ca2+, Mg2+) supplemented with 0.5
mg/ml collagenase type 2 (Worthington, Lakewood, NJ, USA) and 20 mM HEPES (Sigma￾Aldrich Chemie GmbH, Steinheim, Germany). After being centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 5 min,
the collected cells were passed through a cell strainer (40 mm, BD Falcon, Bedford, MA, USA)
and seeded onto uncoated 100-mm plastic dishes for 1 h 30 min at 37˚C in a humidified atmo￾sphere with 5% CO2. The non-adherent cardiomyocytes were seeded on six well coated plates.
After 24 h, the cardiomyocytes were washed with PBS and cultured in Dulbecco’s modified
eagle’s medium (DMEM; Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA) with 20% fetal bovine serum (FBS;
Gibco), 100 units/ml penicillin (Gibco).
Preparation of BM-MSC-conditioned media and luminex analysis
To obtain BM-MSC-conditioned media, BM-MSCs at passage 4 to 6 were cultured for 48 h in
MSC growth medium (PT-3001; Lonza) with 10% FBS, rinsed with serum-free medium and
cultured for 48 h in serum-free DMEM media under either normal or hypoxic conditions. The
hypoxic condition was induced using an MIC-101 modular incubator chamber (Billups￾Rothenberug, Del Mar, CA, USA), that was flushed with 95% N2 and 5% CO2 and placed at
37˚C for up to 48 h, as indicated. The conditioned media were collected, centrifuged and
stored frozen at -75˚C. The collected medium was used for Luminex analysis and other in

vitro experiments. The conditioned media from the BM-MSCs under normal and hypoxic
conditions were analyzed using a Magnetic Luminex screening assay (R&D Systems, Abing￾don, UK), according to the manufacturer’s instructions [26].
Annexin V staining
Apoptotic cells were quantified using the Fluorescin isothiocyanate (FITC) annexin V apopto￾sis detection kit 1 (BD Biosciences Pharmingen, San Diego, CA, USA), according to the manu￾facturer’s instructions [27]. The trypsinized cells were stained with FITC annexin V and
propidium iodide (PI) and then analyzed by flow cytometry using a BD FACS Canto (BD Bio￾sciences, San Jose, CA, USA). The total area of annexin V positive cardiomyocytes was deter￾mined by computerized morphometry (BD FACS Diva software).
RNA isolation, miRNA microarray, and real-time PCR with TaqMan
probes
Total RNA was harvested from heart tissue and cardiomyocytes using Qiazol reagent (Qiagen,
Valencia, CA, USA), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The concentration of each
sample was measured using a Nanodrop ND-2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scien￾tific Inc., Wilmington, DE, USA). For miRNA microarray analysis, miRNA expression profiling
was conducted by miRNA microarray analysis using the miRCURY LNA™ miRNA Array (Exi￾qon, Vedbaek, Denmark) containing 700 mature rat miRNAs. The accuracy of the microarray
data was validated using real-time PCR with TaqMan probes. For real-time PCR analysis, total
RNA was reverse transcribed with stem-loop primers and the TaqMan1 MicroRNA Reverse
Transcription kit (Applied BioSystems, Foster City, CA, USA), according to the manufacturer’s
instructions [28]. Real-time PCR was performed in duplicate using the TaqMan1 MicroRNA
assay kit and TaqMan Universal PCR MasterMix (Applied Biosystems) for miRNA-23a and
miRNA-92a, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Real-time PCR was performed using
the LightCycler1 480 program (Roche) for 40 cycles, (10 s each, at 95˚C, 60˚C, 72˚C). Relative
miRNA expression levels were normalized using the RNU6B (U6) small non-coding RNA as an
endogenous control. The information of TaqMan1 MicroRNA assay kit is shown in S1 Table.
Transfection of miRNA inhibitor
To identify the function following knock-down of miRNA-23a and miRNA-92a expression,
primary cultured cardiomyocytes were cultured in a six-well plate and were incubated with 40
nM miRNA-23a and miRNA-92a inhibitors (GenePharma, Shanghai, China) using INTER￾FERin transfection agent (PolyPlus-transfection SA, Illkirch, France), according to the manu￾facturer’s instructions [29]. For control transfections, 40 nM of negative control inhibitor was
used. After a 12 h transfection, serum-free medium was added, and the cells were cultured
under normoxic or hypoxic conditions for 48 h. The efficiency of the miRNA inhibitor trans￾fection was determined by real-time PCR, performed as described above. The sequences of
inhibitors are represented in S2 Table.
Neutralizing antibodies against paracrine factors
To confirm the effects of the paracrine factors vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and
monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1, the action of these paracrine factors present in
BM-MSC-conditioned media was blocked using a neutralizing antibody (VEGF, 50 ng/ml;
MCP-1, 500 ng/ml; R&D Systems) [30]. Cardiomyocytes were cultured in serum-free medium
in six-well plates to induce starvation for 24 h prior to use. The paracrine factor-neutralizing
MSC-derived VEGF regulates cardiac miRNAs

antibodies were added to the BM-MSC-conditioned media and incubated for a period of 1 h
prior to being added to the cardiomyocytes. After 48 h, the cells were washed with cold PBS
and prepared for real-time PCR and annexin V staining.
Statistical analysis
Data are expressed as the mean ± standard deviation (SD). Data were analyzed using Student’s
t-test (for single comparisons) or one-way ANOVA (for multiple comparisons), and post-hoc
multiple comparisons were made with Tukey’s test using Statistical Program for the Social Sci￾ences (SPSS software version 21.0 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA)). A P-value of 0.05 was con￾sidered statistically significant.
Results
BM-MSC therapy improves myocardiac infarction
In 4 weeks following cell transplantation, immunofluorescence analysis confirmed the pres￾ence of CM-DiI-positive BM-MSCs within the infarcted region of the rat myocardium (S1
Fig). Infarct sizes were smaller in the BM-MSC-treated group than in the saline-treated group
(Fig 1A). The level of apoptosis and fibrosis in the myocardium was significantly lower in the
BM-MSC-treated group than in the saline-treated group (Fig 1B–1D and S2 Fig).
BM-MSCs transplantation regulates cardiac miRNAs
To identify miRNAs whose expression levels markedly changed after BM-MSCs transplanta￾tion, we transplanted BM-MSCs into an infarcted heart and analyzed the expression of miRNA
by miRNA microarray 3 days after treatment with BM-MSCs or saline. The results of the
miRNA microarray revealed that five miRNAs were expressed at significantly higher levels in
the BM-MSC-treated group than in the saline-treated group, whereas 34 other miRNAs were
present at significantly lower levels in the BM-MSC-treated group than in the saline-treated
group (S3 Fig). Among these miRNAs, we selected candidate miRNAs known to be associated
with cardiac diseases. To confirm the accuracy of the microarray data, we investigated the
expression levels of miRNAs using real-time PCR with TaqMan probes (S4 Fig). Because the
expression of miRNA-23a and miRNA-92a was validated to be consistent with the microarray
data and showed simultaneously that highest regulated by BM-MSC treatment in the real-time
PCR, we focused on miRNA-23a and miRNA-92a. Indeed, expression of miRNA-23a and
miRNA-92a was significantly lower in the BM-MSC-treated group than in the saline-treated
group 3 days after treatment, although no significant difference was observed between the
BM-MSC-treated group and saline-treated group 4 weeks after treatment (Fig 2A and 2B).
BM-MSCs release paracrine factors
To identify paracrine factors released from BM-MSCs, we exposed BM-MSCs to hypoxic con￾ditions and collected the conditioned medium. Using a Magnetic Luminex assay, we investi￾gated the conditioned medium containing paracrine factors such as adiponectin, angiogenin
(ANG), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), epidermal growth factor (EGF), fibroblast
growth factor (FGF)-21, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), glial cell-derived neu￾rotrophic factor (GDNF), granulocytemacrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), hepa￾tocyte growth factor (HGF), interleukin (IL)-6, leptin, MCP-1, and VEGF. Among the above
listed paracrine factors, the levels of VEGF, MCP-1, IL-6, and ANG were significantly higher
in the 48 h hypoxia-exposed BM-MSC-conditioned media than in media from cells exposed to
normoxia (Fig 3A–3D and S3 Table).

BM-MSC-conditioned media inhibits miRNA-23a and miRNA-92a
expression and apoptosis in vitro
To confirm whether BM-MSC may inhibit miRNA-23a and miRNA-92a expression in a
paracrine manner, we analyzed apoptosis and miRNA expression in vitro. Based on annexin
V staining, the number of apoptotic cardiomyocytes was significantly higher in the 48 h hyp￾oxia-exposed cardiomyocytes than in cardiomyocytes exposed to normoxia. Additionally, the
number of apoptotic cells was also significantly lower in the hypoxia-exposed cardiomyocytes
treated with hypoxia-exposed BM-MSC-conditioned media than in cardiomyocytes not
treated with hypoxia-exposed BM-MSC-conditioned media (Fig 4A and 4B). In a real-time
PCR assay using TaqMan probes, the expression levels of miRNA-23a and miRNA-92a were
significantly higher in the 48 h hypoxia-exposed cardiomyocytes than in the normoxia￾exposed cardiomyocytes and were also significantly lower in the hypoxia-exposed cardiomyo￾cytes treated with hypoxia-exposed BM-MSC-conditioned media than in cardiomyocytes not
treated with hypoxia-exposed BM-MSC-conditioned media (Fig 4C and 4D). The hypoxia￾Fig 1. BM-MSC therapy improves fibrosis and apoptosis in a rat model of MI. (A) Representative

Cardiac miRNA-23a and miRNA-92a induce cardiac apoptosis
In cultured cardiomyocytes, the transfection of miRNA-23a and miRNA-92a inhibitors signif￾icantly abolished the expression level of miRNA-23a and miRNA-92a (Fig 5A and 5B). To con￾firm whether cardiac miRNA-23a and miRNA-92a induce cardiac apoptosis, we inhibited
miRNA-23a and miRNA-92a by miRNA inhibitor transfection. In the hypoxia-exposed cardi￾omyocytes, the number of apoptotic cells was significantly lower in the miRNA inhibitor
treated group than in the miRNA negative control treated group. Inhibition of the hypoxia￾induced upregulation of miRNA-23a and miRNA-92a reduced cardiac apoptosis (Fig 5C and
5D).

paracrine factors were blocked in hypoxia-exposed BM-MSC-conditioned media using neu￾tralizing antibodies. Of the released paracrine factors that showed significant differences in the
hypoxia-exposed BM-MSC-conditioned media compared to the normoxia-exposed condi￾tioned media, VEGF and MCP-1 were selected as candidate factors, because their absolute
concentrations were remarkedly higher than those of other paracrine factors (>3-fold higher
in VEGF and MCP-1 than in others in the 48 h hypoxia-exposed BM-MSC-conditioned
media). The expression levels of miRNA-23a and miRNA-92a were significantly higher in hyp￾oxia-exposed cardiomyocytes treated with VEGF-neutralizing antibody than in those not
treated with VEGF-neutralizing antibody. The neutralization of VEGF in hypoxia-exposed
BM-MSC-conditioned media showed a significantly reversed influence on the reduced expres￾sion of miRNA-23a and miRNA-92a by hypoxia-exposed BM-MSC-conditioned media (Fig
6A and 6B). In addition, the number of apoptotic cardiomyocytes was significantly higher in
the hypoxia-exposed cardiomyocytes treated with VEGF-neutralizing antibody than in cells
not treated with VEGF-neutralizing antibody. The neutralization of VEGF in hypoxia-exposed
BM-MSC-conditioned media significantly reversed the anti-apoptotic effects of hypoxia￾exposed BM-MSC-conditioned media on cardiomyocytes (Fig 6C), whereas neutralizing
MCP-1 had no effect on miRNA-23a and miRNA-92a expression and apoptosis of cardiomyo￾cytes (S5 Fig).
Discussion
The results show that VEGF released from transplanted BM-MSCs inhibited the expression of
miRNA-23a and miRNA-92a in cardiomyocytes, which led to decrease in apoptosis and fibro￾sis in the infarcted myocardium. We reproduced the anti-apoptotic effects of BM-MSC ther￾apy on infarcted myocardium. Through a screening microarray experiment, we selected
promising candidate miRNAs, miRNA-23a and miRNA-92a, which could explain the mecha￾nisms of the effects of BM-MSC therapy. Further, we created a hypoxic condition to simulate
the environment for BM-MSCs in the infarcted myocardium and tested the same miRNAs to
be expressed in cardiomyocytes by the paracrine factors released from BM-MSCs.
BM-MSC transplantation is one of the most promising cell therapies in the field of cardio￾vascular diseases [31]. Its therapeutic effects on MI, including the improvement of cardiac
function and the reduction in apoptosis, fibrosis, and eventually infarct sizes, have been well
demonstrated in previous animal and human studies [4, 18, 32–35]. Additionally, BM-MSC
therapy has been reported to promote cardiomyocyte differentiation [36]. Our results also
showed that BM-MSC transplantation reduced infarct sizes, cardiomyocyte apoptosis, and
fibrosis in infarcted myocardium.
Mechanisms of action of the therapeutic effects of BM-MSCs for MI remain unclear. How￾ever, some studies suggest that paracrine factors derived from BM-MSCs may play important
roles in reducing apoptosis in infarcted myocardium [11, 37]. Takahashi et al. reported that
paracrine factors from stem cells decide the fate of injured myocardium [7]. Here, we observed
MSC-released paracrine factors; among these, VEGF was recognized to regulate the expression
levels of pro-apoptotic miRNAs in cardiomyocytes. VEGF has been known to promote angio￾genesis of tissues in ischemic conditions [38]; however, VEGF appears to play a role as a para￾crine factor in stem cell-mediated myocardial protection [39]. In this regard, VEGF released
from transplanted MSCs has also been reported to stimulate endogenous repair mechanisms
of cardiomyocytes in a rat MI model [40]. In addition, a previous study demonstrated the ther￾apeutic effects of MSCs through paracrine effect, showing enhanced VEGF levels in heart
tissue and serum after MSC transplantation in a mouse MI model [41]. In our study, we con￾firmed that paracrine factors such as VEGF were released under hypoxic conditions as a result

of the anti-apoptotic effect of BM-MSC on cardiomyocytes. This indicates that VEGF plays a
critical role in the paracrine mechanisms mediated by BM-MSCs, although direct in vivo evi￾dence regarding the function of BM-MSC-secreted VEGF is required.
MiRNAs are important molecules that regulate many biological processes, pertubations in
which cause various diseases [42]. Growing evidence suggests that the dysregulation of
miRNA expression in heart tissue is related to the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease [43,
44]. In particular, a previous study demonstrated that expression of miRNA-92a was up-regu￾lated 24 h after the induction of MI, and that treatment with antagomir-92a after MI improved
left ventricular function and reduced cardiac apoptosis at the border areas of the infarction
[45]. Moreover, the regional abolishment of miRNA-92a was shown to improve myocardial
ischemia/reperfusion injury in a large animal model, suggesting that HL-1 cardiomyocytes
treated with miRNA-92a inhibitor are resistant to hypoxia/reoxygenation-induced cell death
[16]. In a recent study, Zhang et al. reported that inhibition of miRNA-92a was able to signifi￾cantly alleviate apoptosis caused by hypoxia/reoxygenation in H9c2 cardiomyocytes [46]. They
also identified Smad7 as the target of miRNA-92a; treatment with miRNA-92a inhibitor
increased the protein levels of Smad7 although the Smad7 mRNA levels remained unchanged.

MSC-derived VEGF regulates cardiac miRNAs

Additionally, Chhabra et al. showed that overexpression of the miRNA-23a~27a~24–2 cluster
is related to increased apoptosis in HEK293T cells due to targeting of the Fas Associated pro￾tein with Death Domain (FADD) [47]. Furthermore, miRNA-23a has been found to mediate
cardiac hypertrophy, indicating that over-expression of miRNA-23a can initiate hypertrophic
signaling [48]. In our present study, we observed that miRNA-23a and miRNA-92a induced
cardiac apoptosis and that inhibition of the ischemia-induced upregulation of miRNA-23a
and miRNA-92a decreased cardiac apoptosis. Further studies on the targets of miRNA-23a
and miRNA-92a are required to determine the underlying mechanisms involved apoptotic
cardiomyocytes in MI.
Since miRNAs have been implicated as crucial regulators of gene expression associated
with MI and remodeling [49], miRNA expression might alter during the various biological
processes in MI. Indeed, several miRNAs are dysregulated at different time points at 3 days
and 14 days after MI in both the border zone and remote zone [50]. Similarly, Shi et al.
reported that miRNA expression is altered in the infarcted myocardium of rats at 2 days, 7
days, and 14 days after MI, suggesting that altered expression of miRNAs is associated with
progression of MI [51]. Port et al. demonstrated that expression of miRNAs changes tempo￾rally in response to MI, showing different expression patterns of miRNAs in 2 days, 2 weeks,
and 2 months post-MI in a mouse model [52]. In this regard, they suggested that the tempo￾rally altered expression of miRNAs correlated with multiple stages post-MI, such as early stage
apoptosis or later stage growth promotion. Interestingly, our data indicated that expression of
both miRNA-23a and miRNA-92a in the saline-treated group is upregulated at 3 days, but
does not increase consistently 4 weeks after saline treatment post-MI (Fig 2). Additionally, we
identified differences in the expression of both miRNAs at 3 days between the saline- and cell￾treated group (Fig 2). This indicates that the MI-induced transient aberrant expression of miR￾NAs is possibly rescued by the transplatned BM-MSCs.
Recent studies have demonstrated that transplanted stem cell-derived paracrine factors can
modulate the expression of miRNAs in cardiac cells, resulting in improved effects on cardiac
diseases. For example, bone marrow progenitor cell-released HGF inhibited miRNA-155-
induced fibrosis, thereby exerting an anti-fibrotic effect [53]. In another study, bone marrow
mononuclear cell-released insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 inhibited the expression of pro￾apoptotic miRNA-34a, thereby exerting an anti-apoptotic effect [15]. Similarly, our study
showed that MSC-released VEGF inhibited the expression of miRNA-23a and miRNA-92a,
which induced cardiac apoptosis, thereby inhibiting ischemic injury-induced cardiac apoptosis
(Figs 6 and 7). Additionally, unlike previous studies, we investigated the idealized paracrine
factors and miRNAs as candidates through Luminex analysis in BM-MSC-conditioned media
and real-time PCR after miRNA microarray in MSC-transplanted heart tissue, respectively.
In this study, we showed that VEGF acts upstream of the miRNA-23a and miRNA-92a inhi￾bition pathway in cardiomyocytes, and plays a key role in the therapeutic effects of MSC trans￾plantation in a rat model of MI (Fig 6). Unfortunately, we were unable to demonstrate a
definite mechanism of interaction between paracrine factors and miRNAs. Stem cell-derived
paracrine factors are involved in various mechanisms such as alterations in gene expression
following transcription factor activation by paracrine factor-mediated intracellular signaling
[54]. The expression of miRNAs could also be affected by transcription factors. In fact, miR￾NAs are known to be encoded from their own promoters inside exonic regions or introns of
coding transcripts [42, 55]. In addition, it has been reported that expression of miRNAs could
be regulated on multiple levels, including the transcriptional and post-transcriptional level
[42]. Thus, the interaction between paracrine factors and miRNAs is complex and remain
unclear. We believe that understanding of this cross-talk is critical and therefore, we are plan￾ning further studies to investigate this.

The present study has several limitations. First, we were not able to investigate the detailed
mechanisms regarding the role of miRNA-23a and miRNA-92a in cardiomyocytes, indicating
downregulation of miRNAs by the inhibitory effects of VEGF. Further studies are required to
understand the mechanisms involved in the effects of miRNA-23a and miRNA-92a, specifi￾cally regarding the occurrence of apoptosis in cardiomyocytes. Second, We could not establish
inhibition of cardiac miRNA-23a and miRNA-92a expression in vivo by MSC-derived VEGF.
To clarify this, further studies involving the treatment of an MSC-transplanted rat model with
anti-VEGF neutralizing antibodies should be performed to confirm the restoration of
miRNA-23a and miRNA-92a expression and subsequent apoptosis of cardiomyocytes after
VEGF neutralization. Third, echocardiography was not performed to evaluate the cardiac
function in a rat model of MI after or before treatment of MSCs. Finally, the number of ani￾mals included in the present study was small; therefore, future studies should involve larger
number of animals.
Conclusion
In conclusion, MSC therapy reduced fibrosis and apoptosis of the myocardium in a rat model
of MI. These therapeutic effects of MSC therapy could be mediated by MSC-released paracrine
factors including VEGF, which inhibited MI-induced upregulation of miRNA-23a and
miRNA-92a. MSC-released VEGF inhibited miRNA-23a and miRNA-92a expression, thereby
improving cardiac apoptosis in the rat model of MI. This is the first study to show that the
therapeutic effects of MSCs in a rat model of MI are mediated by a reduction in the expression
of pro-apoptotic miRNAs such as miRNA-23a and miRNA-92a by MSC-released VEGF.
Thus, our findings suggest that paracrine factors and miRNAs could be used to develop novel
therapeutic drugs for treating patients with MI.
