Effect of surgeon fatigue on hip and knee
arthroplasty
Background: There is growing support in the literature that patient outcomes are
adversely affected by physician fatigue in operator-dependent cognitive and technical
tasks. Recent increases in total joint arthroplasty caseloads have resulted in longer
operative days and increased surgeon fatigue. We sought to determine if time of day
predicts perioperative complications and outcomes in total joint arthroplasty.
Methods: The records of all total hip and knee arthroplasties (THA; TKA) per￾formed for primary osteoarthritis in one calendar year at one large university hospital
were retrospectively reviewed. Demographic data, surgery start time and duration,
intraoperative complications, radiographic component alignment and functional out￾come scores (SF-12 and Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis
Index) were collected and analyzed using linear and nonparametric rank correlation
statistics. Data were corrected for sex, body mass index, surgeon and postcall operat￾ing days.
Results: In the THA cohort (n = 341), a later surgery start time was significantly
related to duration of surgery (p = 0.004, mean difference –7.1 min). There was a
trend toward significance between a later surgery start time and intraoperative femur
fracture (p = 0.05). Postoperative complications, component alignment and functional
outcome scores were not significantly affected by surgery start time. There were no
significant findings for any of the intraoperative or postoperative outcomes in the
TKA cohort (n = 292).
Conclusion: Duration of surgery and incidence of intraoperative complications for
THA may increase with later surgery start time; however, the relatively small statistic￾al differences observed imply that they likely are not clinically significant.
Contexte : On reconnaît de plus en plus dans les publications scientifiques que dans
l’exécution de tâches cognitives et techniques tributaires de l’intervenant, la fatigue
des médecins a un effet indésirable sur les résultats des patients. Des augmentations
récentes du nombre de cas d’arthroplastie totale d’une articulation ont allongé les
journées en salle d’opération et aggravé la fatigue des chirurgiens. Nous avons cherché
à déterminer si l’heure du jour est un prédicteur de complications peropératoires et
des résultats d’une arthroplastie totale d’une articulation.
Méthodes : Nous avons effectué une analyse rétrospective des dossiers de toutes les
arthroplasties de la hanche et du genou (ATH; ATG) pratiquées à cause d’une
arthrose primitive au cours d’une année civile dans un grand hôpital universitaire.
Nous avons recueilli les données démographiques, l’heure du début de l’intervention
chirurgicale et sa durée, les complications intraopératoires, l’alignement radiogra￾phique des pièces et les résultats fonctionnels (SF-12 et les données sur l’indice de
l’arthrose des universités Western Ontario et McMaster) et nous les avons analysées
en établissant des statistiques de corrélation linéaire et non paramétrique. Nous avons
corrigé les données en fonction du sexe, de l’indice de masse corporelle, du chirurgien
et du nombre de jours de chirugie après l’appel.
Résultats : Dans la cohorte des ATH (n = 341), on a établi un lien important entre
l’heure plus tardive du début de l’intervention chirurgicale et sa durée (p = 0,004, dif￾férence moyenne –7,1 min). On a constaté une tendance à l’importance du lien entre
le début de l’intervention chirurgicale à une heure plus tardive et une fracture
intraopératoire du fémur (p = 0,05). L’heure du début de la chirurgie n’a pas eu d’effet
significatif sur les complications postopératoires, l’alignement des pièces et le résultat
fonctionnel. Il n’y a eu aucune constatation significative dans le cas d’aucun des résul￾tats intraopératoires ou postopératoires dans la cohorte des ATG (n = 292).

n an effort to reduce wait times associated with joint
replacement surgery, the overall arthroplasty caseload
in the province in Ontario has increased by more than
50% in the past 5 years.
1,2 As a result, the number of total
joint arthroplasties being performed during a surgical day
has also increased. Many surgeons now perform 5 or
6 total joint operations in a single day, with operative
working hours approaching 10. There is no doubt that
this increased caseload has led to increased surgeon
fatigue, particularly for cases performed at the end of the
operating day compared with those performed at the
beginning.
There is growing support in the literature that patient
outcomes are adversely affected by fatigue in operator￾dependent cognitive and technical tasks. Adverse events
and medical errors have been shown to occur more fre￾quently in sleep-deprived physicians, and technical skills
have also been shown to be negatively influenced by
physician fatigue.
3–9 More specifically, laparoscopic pro￾cedures,
10 cardiac interventions,
11 endotracheal intuba￾tion12 and colonoscopies
13,14 have been shown to have in￾ferior outcomes when performed later in the day. These
findings potentially have implications for physician pro￾ductivity, procedural outcome and, most importantly, pa￾tient safety.
There are many factors that contribute to the outcome
of total joint arthroplasty, including preoperative, intraop￾erative and postoperative variables. It is well established
that preoperative variables, such as unrealistic patient
expectations,
15–18 diabetic control
19,20 and obesity,
21–23 can
have a negative effect on radiologic and functional out￾comes. Fortunately, these variables are modifiable and
therefore have the potential to be optimized preopera￾tively. Postoperative variables, such as participation in
rehabilitation and avoidance of limb positions that may
predispose to hip dislocation, are also modifiable variables
that have been shown to affect outcome.
24,25 The influence
of intraoperative variables on outcomes in total joint
arthroplasty have been less extensively studied. Duration of
the surgical procedure,
26,27 blood loss28 and component
alignment
29–33 are modifiable intraoperative variables that
influence patient outcomes and may be adversely affected
by surgeon fatigue. To our knowledge, the extent to which
fatigue affects the technical and cognitive skills of the sur￾geon and overall patient outcomes in total joint arthro￾plasty has not previously been studied.
The purpose of this retrospective study was to determine
whether there is a difference, in terms of perioperative and
postoperative complications, between patients undergoing
total hip arthroplasty (THA) or total knee arthroplasty
(TKA) at different times during the operative day.
METHODS
All patients treated with primary THA or TKA during the
2007 calendar year at a single academic university hospital
were identified using hospital medical records. Patients
with inflammatory arthritis, hip dysplasia, posttraumatic
deformity, bilateral single-stage procedures or resurfacing
procedures were excluded from the THA cohort. Patients
with inflammatory arthritis, previous intra-articular frac￾ture, posttraumatic deformity or bilateral single-stage pro￾cedures were excluded from the TKA cohort. Review of
hospital database records was undertaken to verify diagno￾sis and operative procedure.
After obtaining institutional research ethics board ap￾proval, we reviewed the hospital charts for each study par￾ticipant. A data abstraction form was used to gather in￾formation regarding age, sex, body mass index (BMI),
attending surgeon, date of surgery, surgeon postcall days,
anesthetic type (general v. spinal), start time of surgery,
duration of surgery, intraoperative complications (arterial
injury, nerve injury, periprosthetic fracture, medical com￾plication), length of stay in hospital, number of days in the
intensive care unit (ICU), units of blood products trans￾fused, postoperative complications (myocardial infarction,
pulmonary embolus, infection, intestinal ileus, urinary tract
infection), need for revision surgery, readmission within
30 days, SF-1234 scores, Western Ontario and McMaster
Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC)
35 scores and
radiographic component alignment. The surgeon postcall
days variable was used to indicate the days on which a sur￾geon performed total joint arthroplasty surgery after a
night of being on call. Data acquisition was reviewed and
verified in duplicate before statistical analysis.
All patients in the THA cohort had uncemented femoral
and acetabular components placed through either a poster￾ior or direct lateral approach.Two surgeons used a posterior
approach exclusively, and 1 surgeon used a lateral approach
exclusively. All patients in the TKA cohort had cemented
femoral and tibial components with intramedullary femoral
alignment and extramedullary tibial alignment. All patients
participated in a physiotherapy program postoperatively.
Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis was used until
the time of discharge from hospital.
Patient-centered functional outcome data (SF-12
physical health component, SF-12 mental health compon￾ent and WOMAC scores) were recorded preoperatively
Conclusion : La durée de l’intervention chirurgicale et l’incidence de complications
intraopératoires dans les cas d’ATH peuvent augmenter en fonction de l’heure plus
tardive du début de l’intervention chirurgicale. Les différences statistiques relative￾ment faibles observées indiquent toutefois qu’elles ne sont probablement pas clinique￾ment significatives.

and at 3 months postoperatively. Radiographic analysis
was performed 3 months postoperatively to record the
acetabular component inclination angle and femoral
component varus/valgus angle in the THA cohort. In the
TKA cohort, the tibial component varus/valgus angle was
recorded.
Statistical analysis
We performed all statistical analyses using Minitab (State
College, Pennsylvania) software. Descriptive statistical
methods were used to calculate frequencies, means and
standard deviations. Nonparametric rank-correlation sta￾tistics were used to compare data within the THA and
TKA cohorts. We used the Spearman rank order test to
compare continuous outcome variables, and we used the
point biserial test to compare binary outcome variables.
Time of day was chosen as the independent predictor vari￾able for both the Spearman and point biserial tests. The
outcome variables included duration of surgery, intraoper￾ative complications, postoperative complications, func￾tional outcome scores and radiographic parameters. We
considered results to be significant at p < 0.05.
We constructed a multivariate regression analysis model
to correct for the effects of confounding variables. The
predictor variables for the model were age, sex, BMI,
attending surgeon, surgeon postcall days and surgery start
time. The outcome variables were intraoperative complica￾tions, duration of surgery, component alignment and func￾tional outcome scores.
RESULTS
Patient identification
A search of the hospital database records identified
341 patients treated with THA and 292 patients treated
with TKA by 3 surgeons during the 2007 calendar year.
The baseline demographic and clinical characteristics are
summarized in Table 1.
Total hip arthroplasty cohort
In the THA cohort, 133 (39.0%) patients were male, with
an average age of 60.7 (range 14–90) years and a mean
BMI of 29.2 (15.4–57.8). The distribution of cases among
the 3 surgeons were 153, 57 and 131, respectively. There
were 51 postcall operating days for the 3 surgeons com￾bined. The mean number of cases per operating day was
3.1 (range 1–7). The mean duration of surgery was 76.1
(range 45–170) minutes.
The outcomes of patients are summarized in Table 2.
There were 10 intraoperative complications (9 peripros￾thetic fractures and 1 cardiac arrest). There were 9 cases of
superficial infection and 2 cases of deep prosthetic infec￾tion requiring 2-stage revision procedures. The average
difference between preoperative and 3-month postopera￾tive functional outcome scores were 8.4 on the SF-12
physical health component, 3.9 on the SF-12 mental health
component and 29.6 on the WOMAC. The average in￾clination angle for the acetabular component was 43.9°
(range 20°–66°). The total number of acetabular com￾ponents exceeding an inclination angle of 45° was 29
(8.5%). The average deviation from anatomically neutral
alignment for the femoral component was 1.3° of valgus
(3° valgus to 8° varus). The total number of femoral com￾ponents positioned in greater than 3° of anatomic varus or
valgus was 30 (8.8%).
The Spearman rank order test identified a significant
association between duration of surgery and later surgery
start time (p = 0.004, rs = 0.145, t = 2.69; Table 3). How￾ever, the mean difference in duration between the first and

fourth quartiles of surgery start time was 7.1 minutes. The
point biserial test revealed a trend toward significance
between intraoperative periprosthetic femur fracture and a
later surgery start time (p = 0.05, pb = 0.09, t = 1.61). There
were no postoperative complications associated with
surgery start time, and there were no significant relations
between surgery start time and any of the functional out￾come measures.
Multivariate regression analysis using a combined con￾tinuous and binomial variable model was used to control
for possible simultaneous confounding effects of predic￾tor variables (age, sex, BMI, surgeon and surgeon postcall
days). After correcting for all confounding variables,
surgery start time remained a significant predictor of
duration of surgery (p = 0.029). No other predictor vari￾able was found to be significantly related to any outcome
variable.
Total knee arthroplasty cohort
In the TKA cohort, 84 (28.8%) patients were male, with
an average age of 65.7 (27–91) years and average BMI of
33.4 (17.4–81.6). The distribution of cases among the
3 surgeons was 79, 120 and 93, respectively. There were
51 postcall operating days for the 3 surgeons combined.
The mean number of cases per operating day was 3.1
(range 1–7). The mean duration of surgery was 79.8
(range 40–180) minutes.
The outcomes of patients are summarized in Table 2.
There were 7 intraoperative complications (6 peripros￾thetic fractures/femoral notches and 1 popliteal artery
injury). There were 18 cases of superficial infection and no
cases of deep prosthetic infection. The average change
between preoperative and 3-month postoperative func￾tional outcome scores was 5.1 on the SF-12 physical health
component, 0.2 on the SF-12 mental health component
and 28.2 on the WOMAC. The average deviation from
mechanically neutral alignment for the tibial component
was 1.7° of varus (3° valgus to 6° varus). The total number
of tibial components positioned in greater than 3° of
anatomic varus or valgus was 23 (7.9%).
There were no significant findings in the TKA cohort
with respect to surgery start time when using either the
Spearman rank order test or the point biserial test for all
continuous and binomial outcome variables (Table 3).
DISCUSSION
There are numerous variables that determine the radio￾graphic and functional outcomes of total joint arthro￾plasty. These variables may be temporally stratified into
preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative categories,
and they also can be stratified based on whether or not
they are modifiable. The identification and optimization
of modifiable variables may ultimately lead to improved
patient outcomes. Surgeon fatigue may be an underappre￾ciated modifiable variable that has widespread effects
across multiple intraoperative domains.
Our study population had similar baseline characteris￾tics to those reported in recent studies examining out￾comes of primary THA and TKA.
36,37 In addition, values
for mean duration of surgery, intraoperative complications
and functional outcome scores were comparable. These
studies validate our results with respect to patient demo￾graphic and clinical characteristics, operative complications
and functional outcomes.
In the present study, duration of surgery in the THA
cohort was significantly associated with a later surgery start
time. This finding may be partially explained by increasing
surgeon fatigue throughout the operative day leading to
longer procedures, although other factors, including BMI,
sex, proportion of the case performed by a trainee and dif￾ficulty of the case, likely contributed.
38 In our analysis, BMI
and sex were not found to be significantly associated with
duration of surgery. In addition, at the study institution,
there is no standardized difference in the proportion of the
case performed by a trainee based on time of day. Increas￾ing case difficulty would likely result in longer durations;

however, the exclusion criteria ensured that only routine
primary THAs were included in the analysis.
There are several benefits to shorter duration of surgery
for THA, including a decreased infection rate27,39 and
increased residual operating room resources. Presumably,
the decreased infection rate is based on the fact that the
operative wound is exposed to the outside environment
longer with prolonged surgery, although there is no uni￾versally accepted threshold value for which the risk of
infection increases. The duration of surgery in our study
ranged from 45 to 170 minutes; however, the mean differ￾ence in duration between the first and fourth quartiles of
surgery start time was only 7.1 minutes. This difference is
likely too small to result in clinically important outcomes.
In addition, in this study there were only 2 cases of deep
prosthetic infection; therefore, no statistical association
between infection rate and surgery start time could be
demonstrated.
There was a trend toward significance between a later
surgery start time and intraoperative periprosthetic femur
fracture. Increasing surgeon fatigue later in the operative
day may contribute to decreased vigilance with respect to
protecting the femur against intraoperative fracture; how￾ever, other factors likely contributed to this finding. Previ￾ous studies have identified age, sex and osteoporosis as risk
factors for intraoperative periprosthetic fracture.
40,41 Our
analysis showed no differences with respect to age, sex and
osteoporosis in patients who experienced a periprosthetic
fracture. The difference in incidence between the first and
fourth quartiles of surgery start time was 3 fractures (1 v.
4). Although these complications did not ultimately result
in functionally compromised outcomes, they did cause
inconvenience for the patient owing to an alteration in
postoperative weight-bearing status and physiotherapy
protocols.
There were no significant differences between surgery
start time and any outcome variables in the TKA cohort,
possibly because TKA is relatively resistant to fluctuations
in surgical time based on fatigue because the incorporation
of alignment guides and anatomic verifications standardize
TKA to a greater extent than THA.
37,38 Furthermore, the
intraoperative complication rate in terms of risk of intraop￾erative periprosthetic fracture is lower overall in TKA
compared with THA.
Limitations
This retrospective cohort study has several limitations.
First, the patients included in this review were not ran￾domly allocated to a surgery start time. Rather, patients
were arbitrarily scheduled for surgery by their attending
surgeons. There may have been a predilection for schedul￾ing more technically challenging cases earlier or later in
the operative day based on surgeon preference. However,
in an attempt to control for variability in case difficulty, we
excluded patients undergoing revision procedures and
those with a diagnosis of nonprimary osteoarthritis. Sec￾ond, owing to the relatively low number of intraoperative
complications in this study, a more definitive association
with respect to surgery start time was difficult to obtain. If
the number of patients studied was larger, there would be
a greater potential to show a significant difference. Finally,
there are numerous factors in addition to the time of day
that contribute to physical and cognitive fatigue among
surgeons. Despite the fact that we controlled for operating
on a postcall day and the specific surgeon performing the
procedure, it is reasonable to assume that other extraneous
factors may have confounded the results. However,
through the use of multivariate analysis, we attempted to
standardize the data and control for these uncertainties.
CONCLUSION
Recently, the medical literature has identified physician
fatigue as a risk factor for complications in operator￾dependent cognitive and technical tasks. The present study
demonstrates that duration of surgery and the incidence of
intraoperative complications for THA may increase with
later surgery start time. An appreciation of the balance
between surgeon fatigue and operative caseload may allow
for more efficient use of allocated operating room resources
and a lower intraoperative complication rate. These find￾ings should be taken into consideration when planning
operative lists involving THA.
