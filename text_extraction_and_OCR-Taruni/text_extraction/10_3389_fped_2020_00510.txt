Background and Aim: Intestinal failure-associated liver disease (IFALD) affects one-fifth
of neonates receiving parenteral nutrition (PN) for more than 2 weeks. We aimed to define
the effect of IFALD on hemostasis of preterm infants.
Methods: This is an ancillary analysis of a prospective study aimed at defining
coagulation in preterm infants. We included neonates exposed to PN (at least 14
days), in full-enteral feeding. We compared thrombin generation in the presence of
thrombomodulin, defined as endogenous thrombin potential-ETP, PT, aPTT between
infants with IFALD vs. those without (controls), at birth, and after 30 days. IFALD was
defined as conjugated bilirubin ≥1 mg/dl.
Results: We enrolled 92 preterm infants (32 IFALD; 60 controls). Cholestatic patients
had a lower birthweight, longer exposure to PN, and longer hospitalization. Infants with
IFALD showed longer median PT (12.8-vs.-12 sec; p = 0.02) and aPTT (39.2-vs.-36.5
sec; p = 0.04) than controls, with no difference in ETP.
Conclusions: Despite prolonged PTs and aPTTs infants with IFALD had similar ETP
than those without.

INTRODUCTION
Parenteral nutrition (PN) provides adequate nutrients to very preterm infants in the first weeks of
life, when tolerance to increasing amounts of enteral nutrition is limited. Despite evident benefits,
PN for more than 2 weeks may cause liver damage, of which intestinal failure-associated liver
disease (IFALD) is the most common manifestation (1).
The incidence of IFALD is around 28% in infants receiving PN for more than 14 days (1–3).
In cholestasis, reduced bile flow in the intestinal lumen may impair the absorption of fat-soluble
vitamins. Among others, vitamin K (VK) is essential for the g-carboxylation of VK-dependent
pro- and anticoagulant factors (4).

Ghirardello et al. Thrombin Generation in Neonatal Cholestasis
Prophylactic VK given at birth and during PN prevents
preterm newborns from VK deficiency (5). If IFALD develops,
full-enterally fed newborns may experience VK deficiency due
to reduced intestinal absorption; in these patients, oral or
intramuscular VK supplementation is suggested to reduce the
bleeding risk and correct possible VK deficiency (6, 7).
Standard coagulation tests have relatively poor sensitivity
and specificity to identify subclinical VK deficiency and assess
bleeding risk in newborns with IFALD (4). Indeed, prothrombin
time (PT) is not recommended for the evaluation of subclinical
VK deficiency. Recently, international normalized ratio (INR)
was found to be a poor marker of VK status in infants affected by
short bowel syndrome and IFALD (8). A partially carboxylated
prothrombin induced by VK absence (PIVKA-II) is considered
a more sensitive indicator of subclinical VK deficiency; however,
PIVKA-II analysis is uncommon in clinical practice (9, 10).
Moreover, both PT and PIVKA-II account for the
procoagulant factors but much less for the anticoagulant
counterpart, and are therefore not truly representative of the
whole hemostatic process occurring in vivo.
Indeed, during the neonatal period, coagulation is rebalanced
because of the concomitant deficiency of pro- and anticoagulant
drivers. Compared to term newborns, preterm infants express
a procoagulant imbalance, as assessed by thrombin generation
procedures (11).
Thrombin generation procedures can account for
the net amount of thrombin that any given plasma can
potentially generate, based on the balance between pro- and
anticoagulant drivers.
We hypothesized that, in patients with IFALD, subclinical
VK deficiency might affect thrombin generation. To address this
issue, we compared preterm newborns with and without IFALD.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
This study is a secondary analysis of a prospective observational
study conducted at the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU)
Fondazione IRCCS Ca’ Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico
(07/2015-06/2018) that aimed at defining the hemostatic profile
in very low birth weight infants in the first month of life
(11, 12). Inclusion and exclusion criteria and demographic data
of the original cohort were detailed elsewhere (11, 12). The
Institutional Review Board approved the study protocol, and the
written informed consent was obtained from patients’ tutors. All
procedures were carried out following the Helsinki Declaration.
Study Population
In this study, we included all patients from the original cohort
exposed to PN and for whom thrombin generation was available
both at birth and at 30 days of life.
Abbreviations: APTT, Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time; CRIB II score,
Clinical Risk Index for Babies score; ETP, Endogenous Thrombin Potential; IFALD,
intestinal failure-associated liver disease; INR, international normalized ratio;
NICU, Neonatal Intensive Care Unit; PIVKA, Prothrombin Induced by Vitamin
K Absence; PN, Parenteral Nutrition; PT, Prothrombin Time; SGA, Small for
Gestational Age; VK, Vitamin K.
Exclusion criteria were: (i) Extra-dose(s) of oral or
intramuscular VK before blood sampling. (ii) Plasma transfusion
before blood sampling, and (iii) Causes of cholestatic jaundice
other than IFALD.
Patients were daily evaluated for the occurrence of sepsis,
bleeding (intraventricular, pulmonary, gastrointestinal bleeding),
platelet, or plasma transfusion. Demographic data included
birthweight (adequate vs. small for gestational age [SGA]),
delivery mode, Apgar score, Clinical Risk Index for Babies
(CRIB-II score), conjugated bilirubin, feeding mode, days of PN
or enteral feeding, use of lipid emulsion supplements for human
milk fortification, bowel incontinuity, septic events, need for
antimicrobial therapy and probiotic use.
As per standard institutional protocol, all neonates exposed to
PN received Smoflipid emulsion, which contains fish oil-derived
omega-3 and medium chain triglycerides. In our NICU, the
individualized human milk fortification is current practice for all
neonates with a birthweight ≤ 1,800 grams receiving an enteral
intake of 80 ml/kg/die, being human milk more than the half. The
administration of single/multi-nutrients fortifiers or supplements
of lipids, proteins and/or carbohydrates over the entire NICU
stay is modulated by means of serial milk analyses to achieve a
targeted human milk fortification. Enterally-fed infants received
probiotics, lactoferrin and supplements of vitamin A and D.
IFALD was defined based on the value of conjugated bilirubin
≥1 mg/dl in patients with at least 14 days of PN. SGA neonates
were those with birthweight below the 10th centile for GA,
according to the Fenton growth charts for preterm infants.
The cohort was divided based on the presence (study group)
or absence (control group) of IFALD.
Blood Collection and Measurements
Blood samples were collected within 72 h from birth and at
30 days of life from direct venipuncture in EDTA or citrated
tubes (3.2% trisodium citrate; 9:1 vol/vol ratio). Laboratory
procedures included thrombin generation, PT, activated partial
thromboplastin time (APTT), fibrinogen, full blood cell count,
total and direct serum bilirubin.
Thrombin Generation Procedure
Thrombin generation was assessed with a homemade method,
as previously described (13). Briefly, coagulation was initiated
in platelet-poor plasma by the addition of tissue factor
(1 pM) (Recombiplastin 2G, Werfen Orangeburg, NY),
synthetic phospholipids (1µM) as triggers, and soluble rabbit
thrombomodulin (4 nM) (Hematology Technologies, Essex,
VT) as protein C (PC) activator (14). Thrombin generation
was monitored and recorded by a dedicated software that
calculates the area under the thrombin generation curve,
defined as endogenous thrombin potential (ETP), expressed
as nMxminutes.
Statistical Analyses
We compared demographic characteristics, full blood cell count,
standard coagulation tests, ETP at birth, and 30 days of life in
patients with PNAC and the control group. We then compared

Ghirardello et al. Thrombin Generation in Neonatal Cholestasis
patients with and without IFALD, both in full-enteral feeding for
at least 15 days after PN discontinuation.
We used the two-sided Mann–Whitney U-test for comparison
between continuous non-normal distributed variables, Wilcoxon
test for quantitative variables (non-parametric paired data), and
the χ2-test for categorical variables. Results were reported as
median and range (min-max). Analyses were performed with the
SPSS statistical package (SPSS, Illinois).
RESULTS
We included 92 infants, 32 of which affected by IFALD. Table 1
shows demographic characteristics and coagulation profile at
birth and 30 days of life. Overall, four patients presented with
bowel incontinuity, due to surgical necrotizing enterocolits.
Compared to the control group, patients with IFALD had lower
birth weight, higher incidence of growth restriction, higher
CRIB scores, longer duration of PN, and hospital stay (Table 1).
Although the number of septic events was similar between
groups, the exposure to antimicrobial therapy was higher in the
IFALD group (Table 1).
PTs and aPTTs were shorter at 30 days than at birth regardless
of IFALD (p<0.001), but were prolonged in the IFALD group
both at birth and after 30 days (p < 0.05). Conversely, we found
no differences in the ETP neither at birth nor after 30 days of life
in the group with or without IFALD.
Table 2 reports demographic characteristics and coagulation
profiles of patients with and without IFALD after PN
discontinuation and fifteen days of full enteral feeding. The
two groups shared similar clinical and hemostatic profiles.
DISCUSSION
Our study showed that the coagulation profile assessed by ETP
at birth or after 1 month of life was similar between preterm
newborns with IFALD compared to those without IFALD.
In contrast, the cohort of patients with IFALD had longer
PTs and aPTTs compared to the control group both at birth
and at 1 month of age. These results indicate that PT/aPTT
and ETP respond differently to the same coagulation alteration.
This conclusion is in line with that derived from studies on
PT/aPTT or ETP when used in the neonatal setting (15, 16),
and further indicate that PT/aPTT do not truly represent the
real situation occurring in vivo. Obviously, there might be other
explanations, such as the relatively small number of patients
enrolled in the IFALD group, compared to healthy preterm
infants. Furthermore, we cannot exclude that the more severe
clinical conditions of IFALD patients at birth, as supported by
their higher CRIB score and the higher incidence of intrauterine
growth restriction, may have affected results (12, 17, 18).
Moreover, the higher exposure to antimicrobial drugs may have
contributed to alter intestinal flora and subsequent vitamin K
synthesis in the IFALD group. Indeed menaquinones, which
represent the major form (more than 50%) of human VK storage,
are produced by colonic bacteria (19).
Interestingly, in the subgroup of exclusively enterally-fed
patients, mostly with fortified human milk, we observed
no differences in ETP between IFALD patients and the
control group.
Cholestatic newborns are at risk for acquired coagulopathy
due to reduced VK absorption (20) and limited tissue reserves
that are rapidly catabolized, with 60–70% of a single VK
dose being excreted in about 3 days (4). Indeed, oral or
parenteral VK supplementation is suggested in full enterally-fed
preterm newborns with IFALD, although effective VK intestinal
absorption in these patients is unknown.
VK promotes the γ-carboxylation of VK pro- and
anticoagulant factors (e.g., factor II, VII, IX, X, protein C,
and S). When subclinical VK deficiency occurs, inadequate
carboxylation of factor II is manifest by the release into the
circulation of a functionally deficient abnormal factor II protein,
called PIVKA-II (4).
PIVKA-II and serum VK measurements are considered the
most sensitive markers of VK status (4). In contrast, the PT is
a late indicator of VK deficiency as it could be normal even
when factor II is reduced to half of the normal value (4, 9, 10).
However, PT, PT-INR, and PIVKA-II hardly predict the bleeding
risk in cholestatic patients because they account for the action
of procoagulant factors only. In this respect, Dao et al. recently
reported trends of INR and fecal excretion of VK in a small
group of infants with small bowel syndrome and IFALD. They
demonstrated that, during cholestasis reversal, INR remained
unchanged and did not correlate with the increased daily fecal
excretion of VK. Although a direct comparison with our results
is not feasible due to the differences in the study population, this
article further supports the fact that INR cannot be used alone to
monitor VK status (8).
Another recent study showed that, in subclinical VK
deficiency, PIVKA-II did not correlate with functional protein
C levels (20). One possible explanation is that protein C has a
more sensitive response to changes in the hepatic VK-dependent
carboxylase system (21, 22).
ETP, when measured with thrombomodulin (which accounts
for the action of protein C), reflects the action of both the
pro- and anticoagulants, mimicking much closer hemostasis
as it occurs in vivo. Theoretically, patients with IFALD and
impaired VK absorption should show lower ETP compared to
healthy controls.
Our results indicate that newborns with transient cholestatic
jaundice secondary to IFALD receiving oral VK supplementation
(by milk fortification or formula) have a similar ETP compared
to newborns without IFALD.
There is more than one explanation for the contrasting results
between PT/aPTT and thrombin generation in this setting. It
could be that, in the short period, the reduced biliary flow did
not affect VK absorption. However, previous studies showed that
VK absorption was mostly ineffective in these cases, with a rapid
increase of circulating PIVKA-II (19).
Another possible explanation lies in the supra-physiological
VK concentration, which is a typical feature of preterm infants
during the first 2 weeks of life, due to the large amount of
VK received at birth and during PN (10). Although VK has

limited tissue reserves and is rapidly catabolized, we cannot
exclude that thrombin generation is impaired only in the case
of prolonged VK deficiency. However, this hypothesis contrasts
with the knowledge that functionally deficient plasma factor II is
an early indicator of subclinical VK deficiency. Finally, another
more mechanistic explanation could be that (unlike PT), ETP
especially when measured in the presence of thrombomodulin is
responsive to both pro- and anticoagulants. Both are reduced in
the investigated condition; therefore, ETP did not show between￾group differences.

We should recognize some limitations of this study. Although
the ETP with thrombomodulin is a reliable marker of the
coagulation process in vivo, the relationship among plasma VK,
PIVKA-II, and ETP is unknown. We cannot exclude that the
ETP fails to detect small differences in VK status. Secondly, this
study is a secondary analysis of a limited number of patients
without a sample size estimation to account for differences in
ETP between IFALD patients and controls. Thirdly, the small
number of infants did not allow to take into account confounding
factors such as gestational age, antimicrobial therapy and bowel
length, which all may influence the VK status.
In conclusion, our data suggest that full enterally-fed patients
with IFALD did not express coagulation impairment as assessed
by ETP 2 weeks after PN discontinuation. Future studies
with adequate sample size should explore the predictivity
of ETP in identifying subclinical VK deficiency and the
relationship between ETP and PIVKA-II in parenteral-induced
neonatal cholestasis.
