Acute liver damage and ecstasy ingestion
A J Ellis, J A Wendon, B Portmann, Roger Williams
Abstract
Eight cases of ecstasy related acute liver
damage referred to a specialised liver
unit are described. Two patients pre￾sented after collapse within six hours of
ecstasy ingestion with hyperthermia,
hypotension, fitting, and subsequently
disseminated intravascular coagulation
with rhabdomyolysis together with bio￾chemical evidence of severe hepatic dam￾age. One patient recovered and the other
with evidence of hyperacute liver failure
was transplanted but subsequently died,
histological examination showing wide￾spread microvesicular fatty change. Four
patients presented with acute liver failure
without hyperthermia. All four fulfilled
criteria for transplantation, one patient
survived after transplantation, one died
before a donor organ became available,
and two died within one month post￾transplantation of overwhelming sepsis.
Histological examination showed sub￾massive lobular collapse. Two patients
presented with abdominal pain and jaun￾dice and recovered over a period of three
weeks; histological examination showed a
lobular hepatitis with cholestasis.
Patients developing jaundice or with evi￾dence of hepatic failure particularly
encephalopathy and prolongation of the
international normalised ratio, or both,
whether or not preceded by hyperther￾mia, should be referred to a specialised
liver unit as liver transplantation
probably provides the only chance of
recovery.

The social use of 3,4 methyldioxymetham￾phetamine (MDMA), otherwise known as
'ecstasy', and other drugs with similar effects
such as 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine
(MDA) and 3,4-methylenedioxyethampheta￾mine (MDEA) is widespread in the United
Kingdom and Europe. Ecstasy is taken at
'rave-parties' for its amphetamine-like stimula￾tory effect allowing users to dance for pro￾longed periods with increased energy and
reduced awareness of fatigue. Publications to
date have brought attention to patients col￾lapsing with hyperthermia complicated
with disseminated intravascular coagulation
and rhabdomyolysis.' 2 Other complications
reported include cerebral haemorrhage, hypo￾natraemia, and cardiac arrhythmias.3-5 Seven
cases of ecstasy related hepatotoxicity were
reported in a study of telephone referrals to
The National Poisons Information Service,
two of which were subsequently described in
more detail in correspondence columns as
single cases with liver dysfunction.6-8 Six
further cases have been described as single case
reports9 12 making 13 possible cases in total
(Table).
This paper describes eight patients referred
to a single centre with evidence of acute liver
damage temporally related to the ingestion of
ecstasy, two cases presenting with hyper￾thermia and six with an acute hepatitic illness.
Five patients developed encephalopathy and
severe coagulopathy sufficient to merit listing
for transplantation.

Acute liver damage and ecstasy ingestion
deeply unconscious with sluggish and dilated
pupils, hypertonic limbs, and no response to
pain. Axillary temperature was 41°C, blood
pressure 170/100 mm Hg, and pulse 180.
Blood investigations showed a creatine kinase
4710 IU/1, pH 7-27, arterial bicarbonate
(HCO3) 15, bilirubin 25 ,umoI/l, aspartate
aminotransaminase (AST) 3940 lU/1, alkaline
phosphatase 38 lU/1, y-glutamyltransferase
(GGT) 62 lUl1. Further convulsions necessi￾tated ventilation, paralysis, and sedation.
Computed tomography showed diffuse brain
swelling and within 24 hours she developed a
severe coagulopathy with an international nor￾malised ratio (INR) >15, thrombin time 86
seconds (control 17 seconds), and fibrin degra￾dation products of 2 pumol/l (N=<0 5 ,umolIl)
consistent with disseminated intravascular
coagulation. Continuous veno-venous haemo￾diafiltration was started for developing renal
failure. Cardiac output rose to 18 I/min and
despite use of fresh frozen plasma and cryopre￾cipitate, the INR remained grossly prolonged
at 8.4. Toxicology showed serum MDMA
0-1 1 mg/1, urine MDMA 0 04 mg/l.
A diagnosis of hyperacute liver failure was
made with criteria for transplantation fulfilled,
and a donor organ became available on the
fourth day of admission. Postoperatively
cardiovascular stability improved and graft
function was good but she remained feverish.
Despite treatment with broad spectrum anti￾biotics and systemic antifungal treatment she
died of sepsis on day 13 post-transplant.
Examination of the explanted liver showed a
pale liver on cut section with light microscopy
showing enlarged and ballooned hepatocytes
resulting from microvesicular fatty infiltration.
Scattered eosinophilic single cell necrosis was
evident with small foci of collapse due to cell
drop out. Inflammation was minimal (Fig 1).
Case 2
An 18 year old girl noted progressive jaundice
over a four week period with malaise, pale
stools, and dark urine. She took ecstasy on a
regular basis and continued to do so after the
appearance of jaundice. Blood tests performed
by her doctor showed a serum bilirubin of 277
gmol/l and an AST of 1575 IU/1. Three weeks
later she became confused and by this time the
serum bilirubin was 452 gumoi/i, AST 3160
IU/1, and INR 4.0. On arrival she was
encephalopathic (grade II) and haemodynami￾cally stable. Renal function was good with a
serum creatinine 91 pumol/1, urine output >50
ml/h. Her encephalopathy worsened within 24
hours necessitating paralysis, ventilation, and
sedation. Repeat liver blood tests showed albu￾min 34 g/dl, bilirubin 397 pumol/1, AST 974
IU/1, alkaline phosphatase 235 lU/1, GGT 71
IU/1, and an INR of 4. Serological tests
excluded known hepatotropic viruses includ￾ing hepatitis C. Abdominal ultrasound showed
a small liver of normal reflectivity. A diagnosis
of ecstasy induced acute liver failure was made
and she was listed for urgent transplantation.
Her INR became more prolonged (>15) and
she developed signs of raised intracranial

pressure. Despite treatment with broad spec￾trum antibiotics and intravenous antifungal
agents she became profoundly septic with a
cardiac output of 18 1/min and died before a
donor organ became available.
Case 3
A 36 year old woman presented to hospital
with a six day illness characterised by nausea
and lower back pain with vomiting and the
development of jaundice. Ten days before this
illness she had taken a single capsule of ecstasy.
She was admitted to the local hospital and after
10 days developed encephalopathy and was
transferred to King's College Hospital. On
admission ascites was detectable clinically and
investigations showed a white cell count
11.7X109/l, INR 6.5, urea 7.4 mmol/1, creati￾nine 163 pumol/I, amylase 23 IU/i, serum albu￾min 37 g/dl, bilirubin 406 gumol/l, AST 828
IU/1, alkaline phosphatase 90 IU/1, and GGT
78 IU/1. Abdominal ultrasound was unremark￾able and serological tests excluded known
hepatotropic viruses including hepatitis C. She
was ventilated and with criteria for liver trans￾plantation fulfilled was listed for urgent ortho￾topic liver transplantation, which was carried
out on day 5 after admission. After surgery she
developed fluctuating increases of AST
(119-820 IU/1). Rejection was excluded by
liver biopsy and there were no features of graft
reinfection with virus. Angiography showed
patent recipient vessels. Despite appropriate
antibiotics she continued to deteriorate and
died 25 days post-transplantation of over￾whelming sepsis. Histological examination of
the explanted liver showed widespread cell loss
with islands of surviving cells composed of
vesiculated or ballooned hepatocytes (Fig 2).
Case 4
A 21 year old woman with a four month history
of taking up to five ecstasy tablets at weekends
was admitted with right upper quadrant pain.
Six weeks before admission she experienced a
'flu-like' illness followed by general malaise
and continuous pain associated with vomiting
and pale stools. On admission she was not
encephalopathic and examination was un￾remarkable apart from abdominal tenderness.
Initial investigations showed a white cell count
of 5'7X 109/i, INR 0-93, creatinine 63 jimolll,

Liver Unit, King's College Hospital for further
investigations and over
a two week period as an
inpatient her AST settled and she was dis￾charged well. Serological tests excluded known
hepatotropic viruses including hepatitis C.
Liver biopsy showed
a lobular hepatitis with
scattered single cell necrosis, acidophilic
bodies, and sparse mixed inflammatory cells
and occasional pigmented macrophages. The
portal tracts appeared lightly infiltrated by
mixed inflammatory cells including eosinophils
with mild cell spill over at the margin.
Case
5
A 19 year old man,
a regular user of ecstasy,
was found unconscious at
a party having taken
three tablets. No fitting was witnessed. On
arrival to his local hospital he was hyper￾thermic (42°C), unresponsive (tolerating an
airway), and hypotensive with
a systolic blood
pressure of 90 mm Hg. He required ventilation
and aggressive rehydration with administration
of dantrolene (total dose
3 mg/kg bodyweight
over two hours) to reduce body temperature.
Investigations showed
a white cell count

MDMA 0.38 mg/l, MDA 0.03 mg/l. Twelve
hours later
a repeat coagulation screen showed
an activated partial thromboplastin time of > 120 seconds (control 35 seconds), pro￾thrombin time > 120 seconds (control 17

risen to >5000 1U/1.
A diagnosis of dis￾seminated intravascular coagulation and
hypoxic/heat induced acute liver damage was
made, and he was transferred to King's
College Hospital. After admission fluid
balance was optimised and urine output main￾tained at > 100 mV/h with crystalloid and
NaHCO3 (1.4%) to reduce the risk of renal
failure secondary to myoglobinuria. He
remained ventilated for six days with initially
signs of fitting and during this time his coagu￾lopathy normalised (INR fell from 5 to 1 1),

Serum bilirubin peaked at 287 pumoYl on
day 3. Having required ventilation for six days
he was discharged home on day 15, the serum
bilirubin having fallen to 56 pumol/l.
Case
6
A 22 year old man presented to his local
hospital with
a seven day history of malaise,
nausea, pale stools, and dark urine and was
immediately referred to King's College
Hospital. He was
a regular user of ecstasy and
amphetamine up to the appearance of jaun￾dice. On arrival investigations showed a white
cell count of 7-8
X 109/1, INR 1. 1, creatinine
99 ,umol/l, albumin 51 g/l, bilirubin 311
[Lmol/l, alkaline phosphatase 173 IU/1, AST
1191 IU/1, and GGT 169 IU/l. Over
a three
day period he required 10% dextrose to main￾tain his blood sugar. All known causes of acute
hepatitis were excluded and an ultrasound was
unremarkable. Liver biopsy showed ballooning
of hepatocytes and some acidophilic bodies.
Both the sinusoids and portal tracts showed
mild to moderate inflammatory infiltrates con￾sisting of lymphocytes, neutrophils, and
eosinophils. Cholestasis was evident and over￾all findings were consistent with a drug related
hepatitis (Fig 3).
Case
7
A 22 year old woman with
a six month history
of ecstasy use was admitted to her local
hospital with
a three week history of worsening
jaundice associated with nausea and vomiting.
Initial investigations showed
a serum bilirubin
of 129 ,mol/l and an INR of 2. Two weeks
later on referral to King's College Hospital her
bilirubin had risen to 343 Rmol/l and the INR
had become more prolonged to 2.9 in associa￾tion with grade II encephalopathy. With
worsening encephalopathy, an INR of

her general condition but with the possibility of
native liver regeneration, it was decided to
proceed to an auxiliary left partial orthotopic
transplant. In this procedure the left lateral
lobe from the donor organ is implanted in
a

of the native left lobe. Her initial postoperative
recovery was good but she developed worsen￾ing sepsis and died 30 days post-transplant.

Acute liver damage and ecstasy ingestion
showed extensive collapse with small areas of
regeneration. Biopsy specimens taken in the
postoperative period from both donor and
native livers showed severe cholestasis com￾patible with sepsis.
Case 8
A 24 year old woman presented to casualty in
grade III encephalopathy having recently
arrived in England after a two month holiday
in the Caribbean. She had been seen one week
earlier at a local hospital with a non-specific
illness and jaundice. There was no hepato￾splenomegaly and investigations showed a
white cell count of 18 X 109/1, INR >15, urea
0.5 mmol/l, creatinine 52 ,umol/l, glucose 1.2
mmol/l, albumin 37 g/l, bilirubin 407 ,umol/l,
alkaline phosphatase 295 lUl1, AST 721 lU/1,
GGT 123 IU/1. Fulfilling criteria for transplan￾tation she was placed on the urgent list and a
liver became available after 48 hours. Because
of a mismatch in size between donor and
recipient she received a reduced graft. In the
postoperative phase there were no episodes of
rejection and she was discharged home well
after five weeks. All tests for known causes of
acute liver failure were negative and in a subse￾quent outpatient visit she admitted to having
taken two to four tablets of ecstasy in the six
weeks prior to her admission. Histological
examination showed a small shrunken liver
with diffusely collapsed parenchyma. Com￾plete cell drop out was evident with a wide￾spread mixed cell infiltrate, denser in the
periportal areas. The findings were consistent
with drug or viral induced fulminant hepatitis.
Discussion
Referrals to our unit with acute liver failure and
a history of ecstasy use are increasing. Five
cases were referred in 1994 and 1993 with
prior to that only single cases in 1989 and 1991
respectively. Ecstasy was the sole agent that
could be incriminated in causing the liver
damage in eight patients, the other four having
also taken a paracetamol overdose with a
clinical picture and biochemical changes
appropriate to paracetamol ingestion. Of the
eight cases with ecstasy as the sole aetiological
agent, two had presented with hyperthermia,
hypotension, and collapse, four with evidence
of acute liver failure without preceding hyper￾thermia, and two with a less severe hepatitis.
On the basis of the patterns of liver damage
described, the 13 cases previously reported can
be classified similarly with two cases of hyper￾thermia with liver injury,9 10 two reports of
acute liver failure without hyperthermia,6 11
and nine cases of apparent drug related
hepatitis.6-8 12
The clinical features of those cases present￾ing with hyperthermia are similar to those
previously reported in heatstroke, namely
hypotension, coagulopathy, renal impairment,
and evidence of severe liver injury.13-15 Ecstasy
users may be at an increased risk of heatstroke
because of the direct effect of MDMA on
thermoregulation via central serotinergic nerve
terminals in addition to high exercise levels,
inadequate fluid replacement, and the high
ambient temperatures often found at
'raves'.16 17 Clinical features include cerebral
oedema, hypotension, and tissue hypoxia with
impaired myocardial contractility secondary to
thermal injury, as are seen in acute liver failure.
The coagulopathy arises from a combination
of hepatic necrosis, endothelial cell damage,
and thermal inactivation of clotting factors,
platelets, and megakaryocytes.
Survival in patients with heatstroke present￾ing with a core temperature above 42°C is
poor2 18 and severe hepatic necrosis has been
reported in such patients.'9 20 Patients devel￾oping acute liver failure may benefit from
transplantation but identification of which
cases should be selected is complicated by the
overlap between the clinical and biochemical
changes in heatstroke and those of acute liver
failure. We have considered as possible candi￾dates patients with a core temperature of
>41 'C along with biochemical changes
compatible with the worst prognosis after
paracetamol overdose, namely systemic
acidosis (pH <7.3) or renal failure (serum
creatinine >300 Rumol/l), grade III encephalo￾pathy and an INR >7.21 In the only other case
report of liver transplantation after heatstroke
injury, the patient died after 41 days.22 The
histological findings of diffuse microvesicular
fatty infiltration in case 1, although consistent
with a mitochondrial defect (such as in Reye's
syndrome), have also been reported in young
military recruits with fatal heatstroke.23
Whether ecstasy is directly hepatotoxic in these
cases or results in liver injury over and above
that resulting from the hyperthermia is difficult
to determine.
Of the remaining six cases, four had severe
liver damage progressing to acute liver failure
in the absence of a hyperthermic episode.
All other causes of acute liver failure were
excluded including hepatitis A, B, C, E, herpes
viruses, autoimmune disease, Wilsons's
disease, and other potentially hepatotoxic
drugs. The illness was characterised by
malaise, nausea and vomiting, hyperbiliru￾binaemia, and progressive coagulopathy fol￾lowed by the development of encephalopathy
and sepsis. One patient survived after trans￾plantation, one died of cerebral oedema before
a donor organ became available, and the other
two died as a result of continuing sepsis
between three and four weeks post-transplan￾tation. The survival rate after transplantation
(one of three, 33%) in this group is similar to
that of other reported series of drug induced
acute liver failure and most probably reflects
the duration of illness before transplantation
and a combination of poor nutrition and
sepsis. The remaining two cases presented with
a milder illness consistent with a less severe
process of hepatic damage and recovered spon￾taneously over a period of three weeks without
developing severe coagulopathy or encephalo￾pathy. In those cases with acute liver damage
without heatstroke, the development of coagu￾lopathy may lead to further deterioration
and referral to a centre with facilities for liver

transplantation should be made earlier
rather than later as once encephalopathy has
developed, deterioration beyond this is rapid.
However, to date there is only one case noted
with
a successful result after transplantation.6
The mechanism of MDMA induced hepatic
injury is unclear but
a spectrum of severity
seems to exist as assessed with histological
changes varying from
a mild to moderate
lobular hepatitis to features of massive hepatic
parenchymal collapse with areas of nodular
regeneration. The severity of liver damage does
not seem to correlate with either the amount or
frequency of MDMA ingested suggesting an
idiosyncratic type of reaction. Individual sus￾ceptibility to MDMA hepatotoxicity is possible
as
a single case of recurrent hepatitis after
exposure has been reported.7 Except after an
acute collapse with hyperthermia, MDMA will
not be detectable in the urine or blood because
of the short half life of the drug and the usual
interval between ingestion and presentation. It
is therefore important to include
a comprehen￾sive drug history, both oral and intravenous, in
young patients presenting with an unexplained
hepatitis and care should be exercised in follow
up with the risks of progression to acute liver
failure. 1 Chadwick IS, Curry PD, Linsley A, Freemont AJ,
