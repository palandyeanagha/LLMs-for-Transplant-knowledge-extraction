Abstract
Although transplantation of c-kit+ cardiac stem cells (CSCs) has been shown to alleviate left ventricular (LV) dysfunction
induced by myocardial infarction (MI), the number of exogenous CSCs remaining in the recipient heart following
transplantation and their mechanism of action remain unclear. We have previously developed a highly sensitive and
accurate method to quantify the absolute number of male murine CSCs in female recipient organs after transplantation. In
the present study, we used this method to monitor the number of donor CSCs in the recipient heart after intracoronary
infusion. Female mice underwent a 60-min coronary occlusion followed by reperfusion; 2 days later, 100,000 c-kit+/lin￾syngeneic male mouse CSCs were infused intracoronarily. Only 12.7% of the male CSCs present in the heart immediately
(5 min) after infusion were still present in the heart at 24 h, and their number declined rapidly thereafter. By 35 days after
infusion, only ,1,000 male CSCs were found in the heart. Significant numbers of male CSCs were found in the lungs and
kidneys, but only in the first 24 h. The number of CSCs in the lungs increased between 5 min and 24 h after infusion,
indicating recirculation of CSCs initially retained in other organs. Despite the low retention and rapid disappearance of CSCs
from the recipient heart, intracoronary delivery of CSCs significantly improved LV function at 35 days (Millar catheter). These
results suggest that direct differentiation of CSCs alone cannot account for the beneficial effects of CSCs on LV function;
therefore, paracrine effects must be the major mechanism. The demonstration that functional improvement is dissociated
from survival of transplanted cells has major implications for our understanding of cell therapy. In addition, this new
quantitative method of stem cell measurement will be useful in testing approaches of enhancing CSC engraftment and
survival after transplantation.

Introduction
A unique resident c-kit+ cardiac stem cell (CSC) population
which is able to give rise to cardiovascular progenies has been
previously identified and characterized in adult myocardium
[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]. Many studies have demonstrated the therapeutic
potential of c-kit+ CSCs in alleviating ischemic cardiomyopathy.
We and others have shown that transplantation of CSCs is
effective in attenuating left ventricular (LV) dysfunction in animal
models of both acute and chronic myocardial infarction (MI)
[9,10,11,12,13]. Moreover, in a recent phase I clinical trial
(SCIPIO), CSCs isolated from patients with ischemic cardiomy￾opathy have been found to significantly improve cardiac function,
functional status, and quality of life when transplanted back into
the patients via intracoronary infusion [14,15], clearly demon￾strating the utility of these cells for the treatment of ischemic heart
failure.
However, there are still hurdles that need to be overcome to
optimize CSC-based therapies. One of the major problems
associated with cell therapy is the low rate of donor cell survival
and engraftment in the recipient heart [16,17,18,19,20,21,22]. For
example, in a mouse model of acute MI, Tang et al. reported that
over 90% of the transplanted mesenchymal stem cells were lost
during the first 24 h, and only 3.6% remained in the heart by 7
days post-transplantation [16]. In order to devise and test new
approaches in CSC therapy, it is necessary to accurately monitor
and compare the engraftment, retention, and fate of transplanted
CSCs and correlate these variables with changes in cardiac

function. However, most of the methods currently used to estimate
or monitor the number of transplanted cells (which involve
histological, in vivo imaging, or PCR-based techniques) permit only
measurement of the relative changes in the transplanted cell
number and do not provide information regarding the absolute
number of cells present in a recipient organ of interest at a given
time.
To overcome this problem, we have developed a novel
quantitative, PCR-based method that allows measurement of the
absolute number of donor CSCs with a high sensitivity and
accuracy [23]. Using this method, we have shown that, after
intramyocardial injection, CSC retention in the infarcted murine
heart is very low [23]. CSC retention after intracoronary infusion
(such as that used in SCIPIO [14]), however, is unknown. It is also
unknown whether cell retention differs after intramyocardial and
intracoronary administration. Finally, the relationship between
number of cells persisting in the heart and cardiac function is
unclear.
The goal of the present study was to address these issues. To this
end, we delivered male murine CSCs via the intracoronary route
to female mice after MI and quantitatively assessed the distribution
and retention of the transplanted cells in various recipient organs
at serial time points (Fig. 1). Although intracoronary delivery of
CSCs significantly improved LV function measured 35 days later,
we found that CSCs engraftment was poor, and by 35 days cell
retention in the recipient heart was negligible.
Materials and Methods
Ethics Statement
The present study was performed in accordance with the Guide
for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (Department of
Health and Human Services, Publication No. [NIH] 86–23) and
with the guidelines of the Animal Care and Use Committee of the
University of Louisville, School of Medicine. The protocol was
approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of
the University of Louisville (Permit Number: 11064).
Animals
This study was performed in C57BL6/J female mice (age 11–12
weeks), purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor,
ME). All mice were maintained in microisolator cages under
specific pathogen-free conditions in a room with a temperature of
24uC, 55–65% relative humidity, and a 12-h light–dark cycle.
Murine Model of Postinfarction LV Remodeling and
Failure
The murine model of myocardial ischemia and reperfusion has
been described in detail [24,25]. Briefly, mice were anesthetized
with sodium pentobarbital (60 mg/kg i.p.) and ventilated using
carefully selected parameters. The chest was opened through a
midline sternotomy, and a nontraumatic balloon occluder was
implanted around the mid-left anterior descending coronary artery
using an 8–0 nylon suture. To prevent hypotension, blood from a
donor mouse was given at serial times during surgery. Rectal
temperature was carefully monitored and maintained between
36.7 and 37.3uC throughout the experiment. In all groups,
myocardial infarction (MI) was produced by a 60-min coronary
occlusion followed by reperfusion. Mice were then allowed to
recover for 5 min or 1, 7, or 35 days until euthanasia and tissue
collection.
Culture and Intracoronary Delivery of lin2/c-kit+ Mouse
Cardiac Stem Cells
Isolation, characterization, and culture of lin2/c-kit+ mouse
CSCs have been previously described [11]. Transplantation of
mouse CSCs by intracoronary infusion was performed as
described [11]. Briefly, at 48 h after reperfusion, mice were re￾anesthetized, the chest reopened through a midline sternotomy,
and the aortic root exposed by blunt dissection. A 30-gauge needle
connected to a 100-ml syringe was advanced to the aortic root
through the LV apex. The proximal aorta and pulmonary artery
were cross-clamped with a snare for 10 s, during which time mice
received an intracoronary infusion of CSCs (105 cells in 80 ml of
Figure 1. Experimental protocol. Left anterior coronary artery occlusion (60 min) followed by reperfusion was produced in female mice; two days
later, mice received 105 male murine CSCs (or PBS only) via intracoronary delivery. Heart, liver, lung, kidney, and spleen were collected at indicated
time points. Each tissue was analyzed for the presence of donor CSCs by qPCR as described in Materials and Methods. In the 35-day group,
hemodynamic measurements were performed prior to euthanasia to assess cardiac function.

PBS) or vehicle (Fig. 1). After a clamp time of 10 s, aortic flow was
restored.
Isolation of Genomic DNA
After stem cell transplantation, mice were euthanized and the
following organs were extracted at 5 min, 1 day, 7 days, or 35 days
post-transplantation: heart, lung, liver, kidney, and spleen (Fig. 1).
Upon extraction, the heart was separated into three different
regions: anterior LV wall and septum (A LV) which included the
infarcted and border zones, posterior LV wall (nonischemic
region; P LV), and atria+right ventricle. Female human peripheral
mononuclear cells (hPBMCs) were purchased from AllCells, LLC
(Emeryville, CA). Aliquots of 105 hPBMCs (in 50 ml PBS) were
stored at 220uC until use. For isolation of genomic DNA,
QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen) was used according to the
manufacturer’s instructions with the following modifications. In
order to achieve complete digestion, the tissue samples were
placed in screw-cap tubes containing an excess volume of Buffer
ATL (tissue lysis buffer; 400 ml per 25 mg tissue) plus Proteinase K
(40 ml per 25 mg tissue). The internal standard (105 hPBMCs) was
resuspended 50 ml of the above tissue digestion solution and added
to each tube. The samples were incubated overnight at 56uC on a
nutating or rotatory mixer. After the overnight incubation, the
samples were treated with RNase A (Qiagen) to prevent RNA
contamination prior to proceeding to the column purification of
genomic DNA. Control DNA samples, including hPBMC, mouse
CSC, and female mouse DNA, were prepared in a similar manner.
The DNA concentrations of the samples were measured using a
fluorometer (Qubit 1.0; Invitrogen) according to the instructions.
For cardiac tissues, the entire tissue segment was used for DNA
isolation. For extra-cardiac tissues, the whole organ was sonicated
in a suitable volume of buffer, and the total homogenate was
weighed. For each homogenate, 25–50 ml was taken out, weighed,
mixed with 105 hPBMCs and processed for genomic DNA
isolation and qPCR analysis. The total number of male donor
CSCs in the sample was then used to calculate the total number of
CSCs in the entire organ based on the ratio of the weight of the
processed tissue to the total organ weight.
Real-time, Quantitative PCR
For each real-time PCR reaction, 100 ng of genomic DNA was
amplified in a 20 ml reaction using SYBR Green PCR Master Mix
and a StepOne Plus real-time PCR machine (Applied Biosystems).
Each sample was run in triplicate and analyzed using three
different sets of primers (Rbmy, HLA-A, and Vim). The primers used
in the present study are the following: Rbmy fwd 59-GACAA￾GAAGTGCTTCCACCA-39; Rbmy rev, 59-CAGCCCATCCT￾TAGGTGAAT-39, hHLA-A fwd, 59-GCTCAGTTC￾CAGTTGCTTG-39; hHLA-A rev, 59-
GCAGTGAGCCAAGATTGCAC-39; Vim fwd, 59-GCAAGC￾CAGCCCACCTTCGA-39; and Vim rev, 59-ACCGGGTCACA￾TAGGCGCCA-39. qPCR for mouse vimentin gene (Vim) was run
in order to ensure that a similar amount of total DNA is present in
each sample. The PCR conditions were the following: 10 min at
95uC followed by 40 cycles of 2-step PCR (15 sec at 95uC and
1 min at 64uC for hHLA and Vim and 60uC for Rbmy). Melt curves
were generated each time to validate the identity of the amplified
products. The results were analyzed using StepOne Software v2.1
(Applied Biosystems). To generate hPBMC (human) DNA
standards, 30, 100, 300, 1,000, 3,000, or 10,000 pg of hPBMC
genomic DNA was added to 100 ng female mouse genomic DNA.
To generate male mouse DNA standards, 10, 30, 100, 300, 1,000,
3,000, or 10,000 pg of male mouse CSC genomic DNA was added
to 100 ng female mouse genomic DNA. Both sets of standards
were analyzed by real-time PCR along with the samples, and the
amount of target DNA (i.e., human or male mouse DNA) per
100 ng total DNA was plotted against the threshold cycle (CT)
value to obtain the standard curves.
Cell Number Calculations
The amount of target DNA (human or male mouse DNA)
present in the PCR sample was calculated using the corresponding
standard curve and was divided by the amount of genomic DNA
present per cell (i.e., 7.02 pg for mouse and 6.71 pg for human) to
calculate the number of target cells present in the 100 ng PCR
sample. The total number of cells present in each tissue was
calculated using the following equation: M = (m6H)/h in which M
is the total number of male mouse cells in the tissue; m, the
number of mouse cells present in the DNA sample; H, the total
number of human cells added to the tissue sample (i.e., 105
); and h,
the number of human cells present in the DNA sample [23].
Hemodynamic Studies
In the 35-day vehicle and CSC groups, hemodynamic studies
were performed just before euthanasia using the ARIA-1 system
consisting of MPCU-200 P–V signal conditioning hardware, 1.0
French PVR-1035 microtip ultra-miniature pressure–volume (PV)
catheters (Millar Instruments), data acquisition software, and
PVAN data analysis software. Mice were anesthetized with
isoflurane and rectal temperature kept between 36.7 and
37.3uC. A 1.0 French Millar catheter was inserted into the LV
via the right carotid artery [26,27]. Inferior vena cava occlusion
was performed with external compression to produce variably
loaded beats for determination of the end-systolic PV relation
(ESPVR) and other derived constructs of LV performance. The
raw pressure and volume data collected in text files by the MPCU￾200 unit and Chart/Powerlab software were imported into the
PVAN software, which applied a variety of algorithms to the P–V
data to calculate up to 30 cardiovascular parameters [28,29].
Results
Poor Retention and Rapid Disappearance of Transplanted
CSCs Following Intracoronary Delivery into Infarcted
Heart
At 5 min after intracoronary infusion, ,40% of the infused
CSCs were found in heart (Fig. 2; Table 1), suggesting that most
cells were washed off almost immediately by coronary blood flow.
This early loss was expected. Importantly, however, .85% of the
CSCs present in the heart at 5 min were lost in the ensuing 24 h,
and only 3.562.0% of the CSCs present at 5 min could still be
found in the heart at 7 days after transplantation (Fig. 2; Table 1).
By 35 days, only 2.460.5% of the cells present at 5 min (i.e.,
9876211 cells/heart, 1.060.2% of total cells injected) were
detected in the heart (Fig. 2; Table 1).
Throughout the observational period, the number of cells in the
anterior LV wall (infarcted region) tended to be higher than that in
the posterior LV wall, but the differences were not statistically
significant. However, significantly fewer cells were initially found
in the atria and right ventricle, and by 7 days post-infusion the cells
were no longer detectable in these tissues. The only extra-cardiac
organs that harbored significant numbers of CSCs were the lung
and the kidney (Fig. 2, lower panels). The retention of cells in these
two organs demonstrates that most of the infused CSCs passed
through the coronary circulation and were distributed systemical￾ly. The number of CSCs in the lungs increased at 24 h vs. 5 min
(Fig. 2; Table 1), indicating that many CSCs that were retained in
the heart and other organs at 5 min after infusion became

dislodged and entered the venous circulation in the ensuing hours.
CSCs could not be detected in the liver and spleen at any time
(data not shown).
Intracoronary Infusion of CSCs Alleviates LV Dysfunction
In order to assess the effect of intracoronary infusion of CSCs on
cardiac function, vehicle- and CSC-injected mice were subjected
to hemodynamic studies using a Millar catheter at 35 days after
transplantation, prior to euthanasia and tissue harvest. Despite
negligible retention of donor cells, the CSC-treated mice exhibited
significantly lower LV end-diastolic pressures (4.8162.22 mmHg
vs. 9.6261.06 mmHg in control mice) and greater LV ejection
fraction (42.961.6% vs. 35.862.4%) and end-systolic elastance (a
load-independent parameter of LV performance)
(7.4960.84 mmHg/ml vs. 4.1160.27 mmHg/ml) (Fig. 3), indicat￾ing that the LV functional improvement that was dissociated from
survival of transplanted cells.
Discussion
In the present study, intracoronary infusion of 100,000 CSCs
resulted in low initial retention (i.e., 39,797616,482 cells at 5 min)
in the heart with subsequent rapid disappearance of the cells. The
vast majority (.85%) of the cells initially present in the heart (at
5 min after infusion) were lost during the ensuing 24 h, leaving
only 5,06462,780 cells at 1 day after infusion. The number of
transplanted cells declined gradually thereafter, with only
9876211 cells (2.560.5% of those present at 5 min) left at 35
days after infusion. However, despite this poor retention and
survival, LV function was significantly improved by CSC
transplantation, as demonstrated not only by load-dependent but
also by load-independent parameters of LV performance.
This is the first study to quantify the absolute number of donor
CSCs that remain in the host after intracoronary infusion. The
results are consistent with our previous studies of CSCs [9,11,23]
(which used immunohistochemistry to assess cell retention) as well
as with those obtained by others with other stem cells, all of which

have shown low initial retention and almost complete disappear￾ance after a few weeks [16,17,18,19]. For instance, using a rat
model of MI [9], we found a very low persistence of transplanted
cells (or their progeny) at 35 days after transplantation, clearly
insufficient to explain the functional improvement.
In a previous study [23], we employed the same assay and
model system to monitor the retention and engraftment of CSCs
(given at the same dose, 100,000 cells) following intramyocardial
injection. We found that .55% of the injected cells were lost by
5 min, and that .75% of the CSCs present at 5 min were lost in
the ensuing 24 h; only 7.662.1% of the CSCs present at 5 min
could still be found at 7 days after injection and only 2.860.5%
(i.e., 1,2246230 cells/heart) at 35 days (Fig. 4) [23]. Thus, even
after direct intramyocardial injection, the number of CSCs that
remain in the murine heart is minimal. The present study was
performed to determine if a similar pattern applies to intracoro￾nary infusion of CSCs. Our results show that the retention and
engraftment of CSCs after intracoronary infusion parallel those
seen after intramyocardial injection (Fig. 4). Comparison of
intracoronary (present study) and intramyocardial (our previous
study [23]) delivery of CSCs shows similar time-dependent
changes in the number of cells remaining in the heart, although
the initial retention appeared to be lower with intracoronary than
with intramyocardial delivery (e.g., at 24 h, 12.7% of the cells
present at 5 minutes were found after intracoronary infusion vs.
22.5% after intramyocardial injection; at 7 days, the correspond￾ing percentages were 3.5% vs. 7.6%, respectively) (Fig. 4). Thus,
regardless of the delivery route used, transplantation of CSCs in
the infarcted murine heart is very inefficient and results in minimal
cell retention.
Despite their negligible retention, CSCs significantly improved
LV ejection fraction and end-systolic elastance compared with the
vehicle control (Fig. 3). Because the number of CSCs remaining at
35 days was minuscule, differentiation of CSCs into new myocytes
cannot explain the improvement in LV function, a conclusion that
is also supported by our previous studies with intramyocardial
injection of CSCs [11,23]. In addition, we have repeatedly
observed that only few transplanted cells express cardiomyocyte
markers (e.g., a-sarcomeric actin), and that they do not acquire the
phenotype of adult myocytes [9,11], which makes it difficult to
argue that cardiomyogenic differentiation of transplanted CSCs
occurs in the recipient heart in a functionally meaningful manner.
The clear dissociation between cell number and functional
improvement observed here provided cogent evidence to support
the concept that the major mechanism whereby the transplanted
CSCs improve LV function must involve paracrine actions (i.e.,
production of signals [cytokines, miRs, microparticles, etc.] that
modulate the function of adjacent cells).

One of the major problems inherent in previous qPCR-based
methods is that they only allow measurement of the ratio of male
donor to female recipient chimerism (which is often expressed as a
percentage of male cells among female cells) [30,31,32,33]. Thus,
the absolute number of donor cells cannot be derived using such
approaches unless the total number of cells present in the tissue/
sample is known. There are two unique features that distinguish
the current method from previous methods. The first is that the
current method employs cells of another genotype (e.g., cells of
human origin) which are added to each tissue sample as an
internal standard prior to genomic DNA isolation. Since the ratio
of the internal standard (i.e., human DNA) to the mouse DNA
should remain constant regardless of the efficiency of DNA
isolation, the amount of human DNA in each sample can be used
to calculate the total, original amount of male donor DNA present
in the entire tissue. The amount of DNA of a particular genotype
can then be converted to the number of cells by dividing it by the
amount of genomic DNA present in a cell (i.e., 6.71 pg for human
and 7.02 pg for mouse diploid cells). The second feature of this
method is that it targets a novel, male-specific, multiple-copy gene,
Rbmy [23,34,35]. Although the sex-determining factor, Sry gene,
has been traditionally used to identify cells of male origin, it is
present in a single copy in both human and mouse Y
chromosomes [36,37,38], and this limits the sensitivity of its
detection. Thus, qPCR-based detection of a multiple-copy gene,
Rbmy, significantly lowers the limit of detection of male DNA.
In summary, our data indicate that, after intracoronary
infusion, murine CSCs exhibit low retention and engraftment,
such that the absolute number of cells that remain in the heart
after a few days is very small. Our data further demonstrate a clear
dissociation between negligible persistence of CSCs in the heart
and sustained functional improvement that persists long after most
cells have disappeared. Thus, persistence of CSCs is not necessary
for their beneficial effects to be manifest. These observations
provide cogent evidence for a paracrine mechanism of action of
CSCs, and have implications for future studies using the
intracoronary route. In addition, the new quantitative method of
stem cell measurement employed here will prove useful in testing
approaches designed to enhance CSC engraftment and survival
after transplantation and in understanding the mechanisms of
CSC-based therapies.

Figure 4. Comparison of CSC retention and engraftment after
intramyocardial and intracoronary delivery. Female mice with
acute MI were given 105 c-kit+/lin- male murine CSCs by the
intramyocardial [23] (upper panel) or intracoronary (present study;
lower panel) route. The data shown in the top panel are reproduced
from our previous paper [23]. The absolute numbers of CSCs detected
in the entire heart at indicated time points are shown. The number of
cells found at each time point, expressed as a percentage of the cells
found at 5 min after delivery, is shown in the parenthesis. Data are
means6SEM.
