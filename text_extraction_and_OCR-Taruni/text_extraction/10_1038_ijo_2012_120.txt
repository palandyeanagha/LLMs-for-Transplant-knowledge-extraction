Obesity in the elderly: an emerging health issue
International Journal of Obesity (2012) 36, 1151–1152; doi:10.1038/

Epidemic obesity has been observed in the last few years in the
USA,1 as well as in Europe.2 Epidemic obesity is not only a problem
in childhood and adulthood but it also extends into older ages.
The prevalence of obesity in older people has dramatically
increased in recent years: in the United States, more than 30%
of men and women aged 60 years and over are obese. A signi￾ficant increase in the prevalence of extreme degrees of obesity
also has been observed in older ages.1
The increased prevalence of obesity in older ages concurs with
age-related changes in body composition, that is, a progressive
increase in fat mass and a decline in lean mass and bone. There is
also body fat redistribution, with an increase in visceral abdominal
fat and a decrease in subcutaneous abdominal fat.3 Ectopic fat
deposition within non-adipose tissue such as the skeletal and
cardiac muscle, liver and pancreas also occurs with aging.3 Age￾related fat mass increase may occur without significant changes
in body mass index (BMI) or body weight, but it is amplified by
weight gain.
Although obesity, mainly visceral obesity, in adult ages has
been shown to be clearly related to diabetes, hypertension,
cardiovascular diseases and mortality, doubt still exists about
its harm in the elderly. Studies on the relation between obesity
in older ages and mortality show conflicting results, where a
correlation between increased BMI and increased mortality in the
elderly has been demonstrated in some but not all studies.
Interpretation of these data is complicated by variation across
studies, outcome considered, confounders accounted for in the
analysis (especially control for smoking and concurrent illness),
measure of obesity considered and length of study follow-up.3
Trajectory of weight from middle to old ages, as well as changes in
weight in older ages, besides actual body weight, seems to be a
strong predictor of mortality in old ages.
Clinicians taking care of older patients know that unintentional
weight loss is independently related to higher mortality in the
elderly. However, unintentional weight loss may happen in obese
old people in several clinical conditions associated with obesity,
such as diabetes, stroke and others, and it may be another
confounder when evaluating the association between obesity in
old age and mortality.
A consensus panel of the American Society for the Nutrition and
the Obesity Society, after reviewing papers published between
1996 and 2005, stated that both overweight and obesity in the
elderly are linked to physical disability.4 Overweight and obesity
are also associated with higher risk of several chronic conditions
such as diabetes, hypertension, stroke, heart disease and meta￾bolic syndrome in the elderly.4
Despite all these adverse health issues associated with obesity,
the issue of obesity in the elderly is frequently considered
negligible by clinicians.
Actually, a consensus is still lacking even about the definition
of obesity in the elderly. Doubt has been raised about the fact
that recommendations for body weight and BMI do not change
across ages. High values of waist circumference alone, or together
with BMI, may be a better definition of obesity in the elderly.
However, waist circumference cutoff points still need to be more
thoroughly validated as predictors of morbidity and mortality in
older ages.
Given the current increased prevalence of obesity in older aged
persons in developed countries, the issue of obesity in the elderly
should require more attention by researchers and physicians.
In this issue of the journal, papers evaluating different aspects
of obesity in old ages are included. They cover many of the main
topics of obesity in the elderly.
Midlife body weight has been the focus of two different papers,
which evaluated, respectively, its association with disability5 and
frailty.6 In a large study sample of subjects, a significant relation
between BMI assessed at midlife and disability in old age was
observed even after taking into account several covariates.5 After
a 26-year follow-up, overweight and obese midlife men showed,
respectively, 2.06 and 5.41 higher risk to become frail in old ages.
Weight gain from midlife to old age was higher in subjects who
became prefrail or frail in older ages.6
Behaviors responsible for weight gain in old ages have been
evaluated in two large study samples.7,8 In a prospective study of
post menopausal women with a 7-year follow-up, those who
reported a moderate alcohol intake showed lower weight gain
and had less risk of becoming overweight or obese.7 In a cohort of
men aged 65 years at baseline, followed from 1988 to 1998,
physical activity was protective against weight gain:8 subjects
enrolled in 70 min/day of moderate intensity physical exercise
were able to keep their weight stable over the 10-year follow-up
period.
The hypothesis that the length of telomeres, DNA protein
complexes at the end of chromosomes, is associated with obesity
in old ages has been tested in the cohort of subjects enrolled in
the Health ABC study.9 Whether changes in telomere length are
a cause or an effect of weight gain and obesity remains still a
controversy.
De Caria et al.10 expand previous reviews of obesity in older
ages by addressing the majority of the topics discussed above and
adding subtopics such as treatment strategies and costs of obesity
and interventions. The authors suggest that treatment strategies
for obese older subjects should focus more on maintaining body
weight and improving physical function, but avoiding weight loss.
This conclusion, although reasonable, should take into account
the statements of the consensus panel of the American Society for
the Nutrition and the Obesity Society4 and the recent data
published by Villareal et al.11 supporting the positive effect of
moderate weight loss in the elderly. Caution concerning weight
loss in the elderly is supported by the so called Obesity Paradox,
where obesity in older people is beneficial or neutral rather
than harmful. It is indubitable that higher adiposity may confirm
higher protection against catabolic stress by supplying nutritional
reserves. Several mechanisms may be responsible for the Obesity
Paradox.3 Hong et al.12 added complexity to the topic of the
Obesity Paradox showing that fat mass, as evaluated by dual
X-ray absorptiometry, was strongly related to higher mortality
in subjects without organic pollutants, whereas the relationship
was opposite in the presence of organic pollutants with the latter
results supporting, and the former denying the Obesity Paradox.
Identification of different phenotypes of obesity in the elderly
(for example, sarcopenic obese subjects), as well as greater focus
on the health-specific status of each old obese subject, should
be the basis of a rational treatment of obesity in the elderly.
In some cases (for example, old patients affected by diabetes,

hypertension, knee pain), carefully supervised moderate weight
loss with modest energy restriction, coupled with physical exercise
(both aerobic and resistance), may be beneficial.
Prevention of obesity, and in particular of weight gain in
adults from middle age to old age, is very important. Population
lifestyle intervention targeting the increase of physical activity
and the improvement of dietary habits appears to be the most
effective treatment strategy in helping to decrease or maintain
body weight and improve function and fitness in the elderly
people.10
