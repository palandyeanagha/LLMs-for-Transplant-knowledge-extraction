Introduction
For years, the issue of centralization in liver surgery in 
specialist 'high-volume' hospitals has been prominent in 
the debate on improving quality in healthcare. It is well 
established that high volume, in general, means better 
outcome, and many studies have shown lower mortality 
and higher survival rates in high-volume versus low￾volume centers (1-6). Indeed, in high-volume centers 
90-day mortality rate is approximately 3%, with the 
morbidity rate around 30% (7-10). The factors involved 
seem to be many: better knowledge of the anatomy, 
more accurate selection of patients, refinements of 
surgical perioperative medicine techniques, as well 
as optimization of the management of postoperative 
complications (11-15). 
The present review involves all available literature 
on the relationship between hospital or surgeon volume 
and postoperative mortality and survival in liver 
surgery suggesting some guidelines for management 
and creation of centralized departments.
Review of the literature
Table 1 details review of the literature regarding 
the relationship between outcome and volume in 
hepatobiliary surgery. Considering the rapid evolution 
of liver surgery, we have included articles published 
in the last 20 years in English. Moreover, we have 
included only those articles that have declassified 
hepatobiliary surgery from pancreatic surgery, which 
are usually considered together (16-45). As detailed, 
almost all the included articles supported a positive 
relationship between hospital volume and outcome 
indicating the validity of the union of high-volume 
and high-quality. In particular, in 2003, Dimick et 
al. (20) analyzed more than 2,000 hepatectomies 
performed in North America and found that those 
institutions that performed more than 20 resections per 
year had significantly lower mortality. Although the 
resulting cut off of 20 resections per year seems too 
inclusive, objectively the differences were substantial. 
However, in both groups the mean values outranged the 
benchmarks even of that period (6.3% vs. 15.5%). In 
2009 a systematic review and in 2012 a meta-analysis 
confirmed a reduced mortality risk after liver surgery in 
high-volume centers (46,47). 
Few of these articles, investigated how this 
relationship was mainly based on hospital or organization 
factors rather than on surgeon factors. In general, the 
positive relationship was evident both for the hospital 
and surgeon volumes. Even if this is reasonable, there

Abstract: The positive relationship between volume and outcome in hepatobiliary surgery has been demonstrated 
for many years. As for other complex surgical procedures, both improved short- and long-term outcomes have 
been associated with a higher volume of procedures. However, whether the centralization of complex hepatobiliary 
procedures makes full sense because it should be associated with higher quality of care, as reported in the literature, 
precise criteria on what to centralize, where to centralize, and who should be entitled to perform complex procedures 
are still missing. Indeed, despite the generalized consensus on centralization in hepatobiliary surgery, this topic 
remains very complex because many determinants are involved in such a centralization process, of which some 
of them cannot be easily controlled. In the context of different health systems worldwide, such as national health 
systems and private insurance, there are different stakeholders that demand different needs: politicians, patients, 
surgeons, institutions and medical associations do not always have the same needs. Starting from a review of the 
literature on centralization in hepatobiliary surgery, we will propose some guidelines that, while not data-driven due 
to low evidence in the literature, will be based on good clinical practice.

are confounding factors that are difficult to separate. 
In this sense, it is important to note that it is difficult to 
distinguish when high quality care in complex surgery 
is a consequence of reaching the plateau of a learning 
curve or when it is the consequence of a standard 
volume that is a minimum number of procedures per 
year. Besides, it is important to note that good outcomes 
in hepatobiliary surgery are also related to the quality 
of other hospital services, such as the anesthesiology 
service and the intensive care unit, which similarly 
to the surgeons have to reach the plateau of their 
learning curves. In this sense, further studies should be 
conducted to better characterize these two phenomena 
(i.e. learning curve versus minimum standard volume). 
Nathan H et al. (26) reported that the surgeon volume 
was not associated with in-hospital mortality, while 
Chang CM et al. (45) reported the combined effects of 
hospital and surgeon volume strongly influenced short￾term survival after hepatic resection. In this latter study, 
the prognosis was adjusted for several different factors 
such as indication for surgery, quality of the underlying 
chronic liver disease, and socio-economic status that 
were found to be important to be recorded and analyzed 
to strengthen the relationship between perioperative 
outcome and surgeon and/or hospital volume. Besides, 
Chang CM et al. (45) figured out that the combination 
of high-volume surgeons in high-volume hospitals 
was associated with higher quality results, while the 
combination of high-volume surgeons in low-volume 
hospitals was not. Notably, in this study high-volume 
hospitals were those institutions performing more than 
245 cases per year, while high-volume surgeons were 
those surgeons performing more than 59 cases per year. 
Notwithstanding these published studies, the definition 
of "high-volume center" remains to be elucidated. There 
is not an established cut-off of liver resections per year 
to perform (48). 
Centralization of hepatobiliary surgery
The goal of centralization of hepatobiliary surgery 
is to provide optimal care of patients affected by 
hepatobiliary diseases within a given geographical 
area. This centralization passes through a complex 
process of assessment, development of dedicated 
policies, ongoing assurance and support from national 
government agencies, which should have the competence 
and authority to promote high quality care, good use 
of technical and technological tools, good allocation 
of human resources, and at the same time monitor, 
minimize and control the probability of unfortunate 
events. This process should be provided along a space-

given hospital should have to perform hepatobiliary 
surgery. Most of the authors that have focused on this 
topic have reported their personal experiences, which 
anyway should be taken into consideration at least in 
the meantime of the reading out of some new studies 
with data. In 2016 a position paper published on behalf 
of the Italian Society of Surgery had the merit to feed 
up the debate and set some standards of reference (55). 
In Italy the current law about hospital standards is 
detailed by rule n. 70/2015, which divides hospitals into 
three levels (i.e. basic, I, and II levels). Accordingly, 
hepatobiliary surgery should be performed at least in 
level I hospitals or even better in level II hospitals, 
and the surgical team should be dedicated only to 
hepatobiliary and/or hepatobiliary and pancreatic 
procedures. This dedication should warrant a high￾quality standard. 
Moreover, those high-quality hospitals, in which 
hepatobiliary surgery might be performed, should have 
the following departments: i) Department of Medical 
Oncology; ii) Department of Diagnostic Radiology, 
which should include some interventional radiologists 
dedicated to hepatobiliary diseases; iii) Department 
of Hepatology and/or of Internal Medicine with some 
internists dedicated to hepatobiliary diseases; iv) 
Department of Digestive Endoscopy; v) Intensive Care 
Unit; vi) Department of Pathology; vii) Department of 
Nuclear Medicine; and viii) Department of Radiation 
Oncology.
Even stating that the above-mentioned departments 
should be present in any high-quality hospital certified 
for hepatobiliary surgery, there might be a case of a 
given hospital that does not have some of the previous 
departments. In such a case, strong operative networks 
between that hospital and another institution should be 
activated to cover any deficiency. Similarly, in such a 
case of a given department of hepatobiliary surgery that 
does not provide liver transplantation another referral 
center in the same geographical area should be in the 
network to give consultation for liver transplantation. 
It should not be any more allowable that a patient with 
complex hepatobiliary disease hospitalized in a given 
hospital without the titles of performing diagnosis and/
or therapy for that specific disease do not provide the 
required network of care in the same geographical area.
Multidisciplinary team
Nowadays, it is mandatory to have MDT dedicated 
to patients affected by hepatobiliary diseases. MDT 
meetings provide the right global assessment of the 
patient both for diagnosis as well as for therapy. Any 
MDT meeting should include at least one member 
of the previous listed hospital departments with the 
aim to cover all the inherent aspects. Only physicians 
dedicated to liver diseases should take part to the 
MDT meeting, which should be scheduled based on 
time continuum that should warrant quality in all phases 
of the care of patients affected by hepatobiliary diseases. 
These critical issues are very important in particular 
in liver surgery for several reasons. First, the definition 
of resectability is not standardized and wide variability 
is, in fact, observed among expert surgeons (49). 
Second, the complexity of liver surgery is difficult to be 
classified because several different types of resections 
requiring an extremely wide range of expertise can be 
performed. A standard distinction between major and 
minor hepatectomies is inadequate in the current era of 
modern liver surgery (50). Indeed, there are different 
technical solutions allowing parenchymal-sparing 
hepatectomies, much more complex than standard 
major hepatectomies, that remain in the shadow 
of the definition of minor hepatectomy. Yet, high 
quality centers should not be considered those centers 
performing a high proportion of major hepatectomies. In 
this sense, a new classification for minor hepatectomy 
that might help in better reporting minor but complex 
resections has been recently proposed (51). Third, post￾operative morbidity and mortality rates have a limited 
validity to assess quality. Centers selecting only patients 
operable by performing small limited resections may 
have lower morbidity rates in comparison with centers 
routinely selecting patients operable by performing 
complex resections. Fourth, realistic cutoffs of mortality 
and morbidity rates after hepatectomy as a benchmark 
of quality should be defined to avoid the risk of 
denying the chance of care to those patients with higher 
complexity due to tumoral presentation or advanced 
age or because of severe comorbidities. Apart from 
the specificity of their indications for surgery, which 
requires being addressed by the local multidisciplinary 
teams (MDT), risk-adjusted metrics to compare 
outcomes among institutions are mandatory. Otherwise 
the risk of unfair comparisons will remain. In this sense, 
a benchmarking process has been started by merging 
the comprehensive complications risk (CCI) (52), 
liver failure occurrence, and morbidity and mortality 
classified according to the Clavien-Dindo classification 
(53). Last but not least, as recently pointed out by Aloia 
et al. (54) there are some downsides to the strategy of 
aiming at zero mortality rates after surgery such as the 
performance of innovative operations, which at least at 
the beginning are not compatible with perfection that 
might be strongly limited in the context of no-mortality. 
Therefore, the centralization process in hepatobiliary 
surgery should pass through the development and 
adoption of a new and modern common language for 
indications, resectability, terminology of resection, and 
good quality indicators.
Minimum hospital requirements in hepatobiliary 
surgery
To date, there are no specific published criteria that a

(295)
the case-load but in general once per week. A written 
report of the MDT should be provided for each patient 
with the signature of all those members that have 
contributed to the discussion. It is important to note 
that the correct functioning of the MDT meeting relies 
on the proper union between the scientific evidence 
and the local experience in the diagnosis and cure of 
a given hepatobiliary disease. A MDT well balanced 
among specialties represented, and authoritative in 
all its specialists, provides better patient management 
resulting in better short- and long-term outcomes (56-
59). 
Hospital volume versus surgeon volume
Ideally, hospital volume and surgeon volume should 
match while in the real world this is not always 
warranted. In hepatobiliary surgery, the relative 
importance of hospital versus surgeon volume is 
very important because both short- and long-term 
outcomes are dependent on hospital factors, such as the 
presence of intensive care unit, and surgeon factors, 
such as the operative technique. Nathan H et al. (26) 
showed that the protective effect of hospital hepatic 
resection volume persisted after case-mix adjustment 
for competing risk factors, while that was not the case 
considering the surgeon hepatic resection volume. 
Indeed, high- and low-volume surgeons had comparable 
in-hospital mortality rates after hepatectomy (26). 
There are also other factors inherent in the hospital 
organization which were not considered and may have 
biased Nathan et al. conclusions: i.e. an active MDT 
meeting discussing each patient as above stated, which 
was not considered by them and by many other authors 
as well. 
Learning curve or standard volume?
Center volume, surgeon volume, and surgeon 
experience all appear to impact success rates in liver 
surgery. A better understanding of how these factors 
interact to influence outcomes could help to develop 
specific healthcare strategies for the improvement of the 
quality of care in patients with hepatobiliary diseases. 
As said before, it is difficult to distinguish if good 
outcomes in hepatobiliary surgery are more dependent 
on the learning curve or to a minimum standard 
volume. A possible strategy to overcome this infertile 
dualism might be the introduction of certification for 
hepatobiliary surgeons. Far from the idea of more 
bureaucracy, this strategy might include analysis of the 
training with emphasis on the schools of surgery, and 
mentors that a given surgeon might have trained under 
during his or her career to be entitled in performing 
complex hepatobiliary surgery. As recently pointed out 
by some authors, this was found to be a good strategy 
in the field of pancreatic surgery and might work also in 
other fields of surgery (31,59). Besides, it might be the 
way to reinforce the importance of schools of surgery, 
which are those named to train young surgeons. 
Toward certified hepatobiliary surgeons
A strategy to overcome the difficulty in decoding the 
dualism hospital volume – surgeon volume might 
be the introduction of certification provided by a 
national board of specialists. This board should be 
an independent, non-profit organization founded for 
the purpose of certifying surgeons who have met a 
defined standard of education, training and knowledge. 
Moreover, this board might work in defining the 
minimum standard of care in hepatobiliary surgery on 
an individual basis and might analyze the applicant's 
training and operative experience as well as his/her 
professionalism and ethics. Upon successful completion 
of these analyses, the surgeon might become certified in 
hepatobiliary surgery. This certification might serve as 
a prerequisite of good practice in hepatobiliary surgery, 
which together with the above reported minimum 
hospital requirements in hepatobiliary surgery, both as a 
single institution or as an established network between 
different institutions, might be warranted for high￾quality care – independently by a number of procedures. 
Notably once certified, the hepatobiliary surgeon should 
undergo a process of maintenance of certification (every 
5-10 years) with the aim of demonstrating ongoing 
professionalism and commitment to continuing medical 
education in the field of hepatobiliary surgery. 
Conclusions
In conclusion, volume and outcome data in hepatobiliary 
surgery are intrinsically associated with some limitations. 
The published studies are mostly observational, and 
retrospective. Besides, the centralization process 
requires preparatory and preliminary agreements 
among experts about the development and adoption 
of new and modern common language for indications, 
resectability, terminology of resection, and good quality 
indicators. Without these agreements, hospital as well 
as surgeon volume act as proxy measures for technical 
and nontechnical skills. However, such a centralization 
process remains very important to offer better care for 
patients suffering from complex hepatobiliary disease.
