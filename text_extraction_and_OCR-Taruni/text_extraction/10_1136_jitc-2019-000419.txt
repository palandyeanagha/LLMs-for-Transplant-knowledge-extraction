Abstract
Background Atezolizumab is a treatment for locally 
advanced/metastatic urothelial carcinoma (mUC). However, 
its use in patients with renal insufficiency or UC with mixed 
variant histology (MVH) is not well characterized.
Objective To report efficacy and safety of atezolizumab 
in these special subpopulations from an expanded access 
program (EAP).
Design, setting, and participants A total of 218 
patients were enrolled at 36 US study sites (November 
2015–August 2016), and the trial ended following the 
approval of atezolizumab by the US Food and Drug 
Administration. This post hoc analysis investigated 
outcomes in specific study subgroups.
Intervention Atezolizumab 1200 mg was administered 
intravenously every 3 weeks until loss of clinical benefit, 
unacceptable toxicity, death, consent withdrawal, decision 
to discontinue, commercial availability, or study closure.
Outcome measurements and statistical 
analysis Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 
V.1.1 responses and safety were evaluated by baseline 
renal function and histology.
Results and limitations Objective responses occurred 
in 0/6 (0%), 4/19 (21%), 1/27 (3.7%), and 12/62 (19%) of 
evaluable patients with creatinine clearance (CrCl) <30, 
30–45, 45–60, and ≥60 mL/min, respectively, and stable 
disease was seen in three patients with CrCl <30 mL/
min. Objective responses were seen in 13/102 patients 
(13%) with urothelial carcinoma (UC) histology only and 
in 4/12 patients (33%) with UC with MVH. Treatment￾related adverse event frequencies ranged from 35% to 
54% across the earlier indicated CrCl subgroups and they 
were also similar in patients with pure UC or UC with MVH 
(46%).
Conclusions In this EAP mUC subgroup analysis, 
clinical benefit of atezolizumab occurred in patients with 
compromised renal function or MVH UC tumors. Safety 
was comparable across subgroups.
Patient summary We examined the efficacy and safety of 
atezolizumab for UC in certain patients participating in an 
EAP. We found that responses to atezolizumab occurred, 
and safety was similar, in most patient subgroups with 
varying levels of kidney functioning or less common types 
of tumor tissue histology.
Introduction
Locally advanced or metastatic urothelial 
carcinoma (mUC) is often treated with 
cisplatin-based chemotherapy as a standard 
first-line approach.1 2 However, many patients 
are cisplatin-ineligible, and carboplatin￾based alternatives are associated with shorter 
overall survival (OS).3
 Most patients eventu￾ally progress following platinum-based regi￾mens.4
 Evidence shows that non-treatment is 
common1 2 5 and 5-year survival rates in the 
USA have historically been low.6
 Recently, 
checkpoint inhibitors have been approved 
in the USA, Europe, and elsewhere for 
patients with mUC who experience progres￾sion during or following platinum-based 
chemotherapy.7 8 Prior to atezolizumab’s 
US approval, and based on favorable data 
from earlier studies,9–11 an expanded access 
program (EAP) was conducted to grant 
access to this patient population. This EAP12
enrolled a broader range of patients than 
those who are typically enrolled in phase 1–3 
clinical trials, providing an opportunity to 
better understand the role of atezolizumab in 
special populations.
In patients with mUC, baseline clinical 
characteristics or pre-existing comorbidities 
can limit treatment options and lead to treat￾ment complications. One condition that is 
common to many patients with mUC is renal 
insufficiency (eg, creatinine clearance (CrCl) 
of <60mL/min), which may be due to factors 
such as age, smoking-related vascular disease,

urothelial carcinoma (UC)-related urinary tract obstruc￾tion,5
 recent nephroureterectomy,13 and postcystectomy 
hydronephrosis.14Renal insufficiency can preclude first￾line cisplatin administration5
 or stem from treatment 
with cisplatin.15 Since renal function declines steadily 
after age 3016 and the median age at UC diagnosis in the 
USA is 72 years, significant decline in renal function is 
not uncommon among newly diagnosed patients,5 6
 as 
demonstrated in a study of patients undergoing radical 
cystectomy, wherein >40% of patients older than 70 years 
had a CrCl of <60mL/min.17 One meta-analysis with data 
from >5000UC cases demonstrated a correlation between 
preoperative renal insufficiency and worse prognosis, 
underscoring the importance of renal function in devel￾oping an optimal treatment plan.18
Another consideration is that although the most 
common histological type of urinary tract cancers is UC, 
with bladder being the most common location (followed 
by renal pelvis, ureter, and urethra),19 UC with mixed 
histological features, including micropapillary, glan￾dular, squamous, sarcomatoid, plasmacytoid, lymphoe￾pithelioma like, and/or nested histology components, 
as defined by the WHO,19 is quite common. In cystec￾tomy specimens, the incidence of UC with mixed variant 
histology (MVH; sometimes termed divergent differenti￾ation) may reach 33%.19 Data suggested that some vari￾ants of pure non-UC (eg, small-cell and squamous bladder 
cancer) portend worse prognosis than UC and should be 
treated differently, but whether these results extend to 
all patients with MVH remains less well characterized.20
Although MVH appears to be associated with predictors of 
tumor aggressive behavior and adverse outcome in some 
studies, outcome data are limited,19 21 with occasional 
case reports suggesting that immunotherapy is active.22
In this analysis from the EAP study, we evaluated efficacy 
and safety outcomes with atezolizumab in patients with 
impaired baseline renal function or UC with MVH.
Patients and methods
Study design, patients, and procedures
The overall study design and primary analysis of this 
single-arm, open-label EAP were previously reported12 (
ClinicalTrials.gov ID NCT02589717). The primary objec￾tive was to provide access to atezolizumab to eligible 
patients before US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
approval was granted.
Key eligibility criteria included histologically or cyto￾logically documented, inoperable, locally advanced (T4b, 
any N or any T, N 2–3), or metastatic (M1 or stage IV) 
UC; primary tumor site of bladder, urethra, renal pelvis, 
or ureter with dominant UC (transitional cell) histology; 
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 
(ECOG PS) of 0–2; and disease recurrence or progression 
during or following ≥1 platinum-containing regimen (≥2 
cycles) for mUC. Patients who progressed within 12 months 
of treatment with a platinum-containing adjuvant/neoad￾juvant regimen were also eligible. The number of prior 
therapies a patient could have received was unrestricted. 
Enrollment was initially restricted to programmed death 
ligand 1 (PD-L1)-selected patients (tumor-infiltrating 
immune cell 2/3 (IC2/3) status and PD-L1 expression 
on IC of ≥5% per VENTANA SP142 PD-L1 immunohis￾tochemistry assay) but was later extended per protocol 
amendment to allow enrollment regardless of PD-L1 
status. Enrollment also initially excluded patients with 
significant renal disorders requiring dialysis or indica￾tions for renal transplant but it was later amended such 
that there were no restrictions on CrCl levels.
Patients received atezolizumab 1200mg intravenously 
every 3 weeks and they could be treated past disease 
progression (evaluated per Response Evaluation Criteria 
in Solid Tumors V.1.1 (RECIST V.1.1)) or until loss of 
clinical benefit (per investigator), unacceptable toxicity, 
consent withdrawal, decision to discontinue treatment 
(per patient or physician), death, commercial study drug 
availability (following FDA approval), or study termina￾tion. Tumor assessments occurred approximately every 9 
weeks (every 12 weeks after the first 54 weeks).
Study assessments and analyses
Key efficacy objectives included investigator-assessed 
RECIST V.1.1 objective response rate (ORR) and disease 
control rate (DCR) (frequency of patients with complete 
response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease 
(SD)). Response-evaluable patients were those with 
measurable disease at baseline and ≥1 non-missing post￾baseline tumor assessment. OS was defined as the time 
from study treatment initiation to death from any cause. 
Safety was assessed per Common Terminology Criteria 
for Adverse Events V.4.0. Safety-evaluable patients were 
those who received ≥1dose of atezolizumab. Follow-up 
was defined as the duration between initiation of atezoli￾zumab and when the patient was last known to be alive or 
had died.
Post hoc subgroup analyses of efficacy and safety were 
performed based on baseline CrCl levels (<30, 30–45, 
45–60, and ≥60mL/min) and tumor histology (pure 
UC histology only or UC with MVH). There was no 
formal statistical hypothesis testing, and all analyses were 
descriptive.
Results
Patients and treatment
This study enrolled 218 patients from 36 US study sites 
between November 2015 and August 2016, ending on 
FDA approval of atezolizumab. Patients could continue 
on commercially available atezolizumab treatment as 
appropriate, but study assessments aside from optional 
long-term survival follow-up did not continue. The data 
cut-off was October 5, 2016, at which time the median 
follow-up in all treated patients was 2.3 months (range 
0.03–6.7). In the overall cohort, 214 patients were treated 
and were evaluable for safety, and 114 were evaluable for 
response assessments (figure 1). Overall, among treated

patients, characteristics were balanced across subgroups 
of interest (table 1) with a few exceptions. Fewer men 
were in the two lowest CrCl subgroups. The lowest CrCl 
subgroup and the MVH group contained fewer patients 
with ECOG PS of 0. Among evaluable patients with CrCl 
of <30mL/min and non-missing PD-L1 status, all had 
IC2/3 (n=5).
Efficacy
In the overall cohort of objective response-evaluable 
patients (n=114), the ORR was 15% (95% CI, 9% to 23%) 
and the DCR was 49% (95% CI, 40% to 59%). Objec￾tive responses occurred in patient subgroups with base￾line CrCl of ≥30 mL/min: in 4 patients with 30–45 mL/
min (21%), 1 with 45–60 mL/min (4%), and 12 with 
≥60 mL/min (19%). CRs occurred in one patient with 
CrCl of 30–45 mL/min and two patients with CrCl of 
≥60 mL/min. Additionally, three of the six patients with 
CrCl of <30 mL/min achieved SD (figure 2). Due to the 
short duration of the study with a median follow-up of 
2.3 months, OS data were immature. At the time of the 
analysis, 23%–31% had died across CrCl subgroups.
The ORR was 13% in patients with pure UC only 
(n=13 of 102) and 33% in patients with UC with MVH 
(n=4 of 12). Eleven patients with pure UC had PR, and 
two had CR. Responses did not appear to cluster with 
specific mixed histology components (figure 2); three 
PRs―in one of the two patients with an adenocarci￾noma histology component, in a patient with a glan￾dular component, and in a patient with a component 
with sarcomatoid/rhabdoid differentiation―and 1 CR 
occurred (in a patient with UC with MVH with squa￾mous/glandular differentiation). SD as best response 
also occurred in 36 patients (35%) in the pure UC popu￾lation and in 3 (25%) of the UC with MVH population, 
the latter of which included those with squamous (n=2) 
or papillary (n=1) histology components. The DCRs 
were 48% and 58% in patients with pure UC and UC 
with MVH, respectively (figure 2).
Safety
All-grade treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) 
occurred in 98 of the 214 safety-evaluable patients 
(46%) and ranged from 35% (in the CrCl 30–45 mL/
min subgroup) to 54% (CrCl 45–60 mL/min). Overall, 
11 patients (5.1%) had serious TRAEs that occurred 
in two patients with CrCl of <30 mL/min (15%) and at 
rates of ≤8% in other subgroups. Four patients (2%) 
had TRAEs leading to treatment discontinuation (≤3% 
across subgroups), and none were due to renal events. 
Overall, 59 patients (28%) had AEs of special interest 
(AESIs), and AESI rates ranged from 15% (CrCl 
<30 mL/min) to 32% (CrCl ≥60 mL/min) (table 2). 
Renal treatment-related AEs occurred only in patients 
with baseline CrCl of ≥30 mL/min, including immune￾related nephritis (n=2), acute kidney injury (n=2), and 
proteinuria (n=1).
TRAEs occurred in 87 patients with pure UC and 
11 patients with UC with MVH tumors (46% each). 
Four patients with pure UC (2.1%) and none with UC 
with MVH had TRAEs leading to discontinuation. The 
frequency of AESIs was also similar between pure UC 
and UC with MVH subpopulations (27% and 29%, 
respectively). AESIs were not observed in patients 
with UC mixed with adenocarcinoma or sarcoma￾toid histology but they occurred in 1 of the 8 patients 
(13%) with UC mixed with squamous histology and 6 
of the 10 patients (60%) with other MVH components 
(table 2).

Discussion
The availability of checkpoint inhibitors such as atezoli￾zumab has greatly changed the treatment landscape 
for patients with UC, including those who progress on 
platinum-based chemotherapy for whom treatment 
options were previously limited to chemotherapy. 
However, there still exists an unmet need for patients 
with comorbidities or uncommon tumor features—who 
are often excluded, under-represented, or not compre￾hensively evaluated in clinical trials―resulting in limited 
outcomes data for these subsets. In particular, patients 
with renal insufficiency or non-UC histology may have 
worse prognoses than their counterparts.18 21 Following 
a protocol amendment, this EAP allowed for enrollment 
of patients irrespective of CrCl levels or the presence 
of renal disorders requiring dialysis or indications for 
renal transplant, permitting characterization of patients 
not eligible for the pivotal phase 2–3 IMvigor210 and 
IMvigor211 studies (atezolizumab in platinum-treated 
mUC). Furthermore, this EAP reported an 11% frequency 
(n=24) of treated patients with UC with MVH tumors.12
This post hoc analysis aimed to evaluate outcomes with 
checkpoint inhibitor therapy in these subsets of patients.
In this study, objective response occurred in patient 
subgroups with CrCl ranging from 30 to 60mL/min. 
These observations are in agreement with data from both 
the cisplatin-ineligible and platinum-treated cohorts of 
the IMvigor210 trial, which reported objective responses 
to atezolizumab in patient subsets with baseline CrCl 
of 30–60mL/min.3 10 SD also occurred in three of the 
six patients with CrCl of <30mL/min, a subgroup not 
included in IMvigor210. These observations also agreed 
with data from the large, international phase 3b SAUL 
study (atezolizumab in mUC populations broader than/
not eligible for IMvigor211), which found that patients 
with renal impairment (calculated CrCl <30but ≥15mL/
min) generally demonstrated ORRs consistent with those 
of the overall population, and SAUL also demonstrated 
OS in line with that of previous pivotal UC trials.23 In this 
EAP, responses and SD also occurred in patients with UC 
with MVH. One patient with other MVH (UC with squa￾mous/glandular differentiation) achieved a CR, and two 
of the four evaluable patients with UC with a squamous 
MVH component achieved SD. Furthermore, one of the 
two evaluable patients with UC mixed with an adenocar￾cinoma histology component had a PR, and additional 
instances of PR (n=2) and SD (n=1) in the remaining 
population were distributed among patients with other 
mixed histology components (figure 2). Similarly, in the 
SAUL study that enrolled patients with mixed or non-UC 
histology, objective responses, including a CR, were also 
observed.23
The safety of atezolizumab was comparable among the 
subgroups evaluated in this study. Across all evaluated CrCl 
subgroups, the frequency of TRAEs was generally compa￾rable, overall ranging from 35% to 54%. Serious TRAEs 
occurred in two patients with CrCl of <30mL/min (15%) 
and at rates of ≤8% in other subgroups. Renal TRAEs 
were infrequent, did not lead to discontinuation, and did 
not occur in patients with CrCl of <30mL/min. These 
observations add to data from other studies, including 
the cisplatin-ineligible cohort of IMvigor210 (wherein 
atezolizumab was tolerable and did not result in decrease 
of median glomerular filtration rate in a patient cohort 
that mostly had renal impairment (30–60mL/min))3
 and 
renally impaired patients from SAUL (in whom safety was 
similar to that in the overall population).23 Also mirroring 
these safety results from SAUL,23 TRAEs in the histology 
subgroups of this EAP were similar, irrespective of histo￾logical features.

This study provides new information on outcomes with 
checkpoint inhibitor therapy in special populations of 
patients with mUC from an EAP, particularly those with 
CrCl of <30mL/min, who have often been excluded 
from clinical trials. These results complement retrospec￾tive data from a recent multicenter analysis of patients 
with advanced solid tumors and baseline organ dysfunc￾tion (including renal) treated with anti-programmed 
death 1 checkpoint inhibitor therapy,24 which reported 
similar rates of immune-related AE frequencies as those 
in more general populations and encouraging efficacy, 
noting that such agents may be a feasible treatment for 
this challenging patient population. These data also echo 
recent results from a study on previously platinum-treated 
patients given the checkpoint inhibitor pembrolizumab, 
which reported OS benefit in favor of pembrolizumab 
over chemotherapy, notably for patients with MVH 
(although safety data were not reported by histological 
type).25 A limitation of this EAP study was its short dura￾tion, based on the timing of atezolizumab approval,12
which could affect characterization of both efficacy and 
safety results. Also, sample sizes in certain subsets were 
small; thus, current results need to be interpreted with 
caution, and further analyses in larger populations are 
warranted. Furthermore, minor differences in baseline 
characteristics between the subgroups (eg, ECOG PS, 
PD-L1 status) in this study were not controlled for. Still, 
these efficacy and safety results suggest that atezolizumab 
provides clinical benefit to a spectrum of patients with 
platinum-treated mUC, and these results were recently 
corroborated by findings in similar patient subgroups 
(eg, with MVH or renal insufficiency) in a more real￾world-like population from the SAUL study.23
Conclusions
In this subgroup analysis from a US EAP of atezoli￾zumab in patients with previously platinum-treated mUC, 
outcomes were evaluated by patient baseline renal func￾tion and histology. Efficacy and safety were demonstrated 
in patients with compromised renal function or UC with 
MVH. The results suggest that atezolizumab provides 
clinical benefit in a spectrum of patients with platinum￾treated mUC.
