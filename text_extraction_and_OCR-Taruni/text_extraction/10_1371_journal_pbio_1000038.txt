The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) regulates cell growth and survival by integrating nutrient and hormonal
signals. These signaling functions are distributed between at least two distinct mTOR protein complexes: mTORC1 and
mTORC2. mTORC1 is sensitive to the selective inhibitor rapamycin and activated by growth factor stimulation via the
canonical phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)!Akt!mTOR pathway. Activated mTORC1 kinase up-regulates protein
synthesis by phosphorylating key regulators of mRNA translation. By contrast, mTORC2 is resistant to rapamycin.
Genetic studies have suggested that mTORC2 may phosphorylate Akt at S473, one of two phosphorylation sites
required for Akt activation; this has been controversial, in part because RNA interference and gene knockouts produce
distinct Akt phospho-isoforms. The central role of mTOR in controlling key cellular growth and survival pathways has
sparked interest in discovering mTOR inhibitors that bind to the ATP site and therefore target both mTORC2 and
mTORC1. We investigated mTOR signaling in cells and animals with two novel and specific mTOR kinase domain
inhibitors (TORKinibs). Unlike rapamycin, these TORKinibs (PP242 and PP30) inhibit mTORC2, and we use them to show
that pharmacological inhibition of mTOR blocks the phosphorylation of Akt at S473 and prevents its full activation.
Furthermore, we show that TORKinibs inhibit proliferation of primary cells more completely than rapamycin.
Surprisingly, we find that mTORC2 is not the basis for this enhanced activity, and we show that the TORKinib PP242 is a
more effective mTORC1 inhibitor than rapamycin. Importantly, at the molecular level, PP242 inhibits cap-dependent
translation under conditions in which rapamycin has no effect. Our findings identify new functional features of
mTORC1 that are resistant to rapamycin but are effectively targeted by TORKinibs. These potent new pharmacological
agents complement rapamycin in the study of mTOR and its role in normal physiology and human disease.

Introduction
The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a serine￾threonine kinase related to the lipid kinases of the
phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) family. mTOR exists in
two complexes, mTORC1 [1,2] and mTORC2 [3,4], which are
differentially regulated, have distinct substrate specificities,
and are differentially sensitive to rapamycin. mTORC1
integrates signals from growth factor receptors with cellular
nutritional status and controls the level of cap-dependent
mRNA translation by modulating the activity of key transla￾tional components such as the cap-binding protein and
oncogene eIF4E [5].
mTORC2 is insensitive to rapamycin, and selective inhib￾itors of this complex have not been described. Partly because
acute pharmacological inhibition of mTORC2 has not been
possible, the functions of mTORC2 are less well understood
than those of mTORC1. mTORC2 is thought to modulate
growth factor signaling by phosphorylating the C-terminal
hydrophobic motif of some AGC kinases such as Akt [3,6] and
SGK [7] although other kinases, including DNA-PK and Ilk,
have also been implicated in Akt hydrophobic motif
phosphorylation [8–11]. Growth factor stimulation of PI3K
causes activation of Akt by phosphorylation at two key sites:
the activation loop (T308) and the C-terminal hydrophobic
motif (S473). Active Akt promotes cell survival in many ways,
including suppressing apoptosis, promoting glucose uptake,
and modifying cellular metabolism [12]; consequently, there
is significant interest in identifying the kinase(s) responsible
for each activating phosphorylation, the relationship between
these phosphorylation sites, and the role of differential Akt
phosphorylation on Akt substrate phosphorylation. Of the
two phosphorylation sites on Akt, activation loop phosphor￾ylation at T308, which is mediated by PDK1, is indispensable

for kinase activity, whereas hydrophobic motif phosphoryla￾tion at S473 enhances Akt kinase activity by approximately 5-
fold [13].
The disruption of mTORC2 by different genetic and
pharmacological approaches has variable effects on Akt
phosphorylation. Targeting mTORC2 by RNA interference
(RNAi) [6,14], homologous recombination [15–17], or long￾term rapamycin treatment [18] results in loss of Akt hydro￾phobic motif phosphorylation (S473), strongly implicating
mTORC2 as the kinase responsible for phosphorylation of
this site. RNAi targeting mTORC2 and long-term rapamycin
result in loss of Akt phosphorylation on its activation loop
(T308), but this phosphorylation remains intact in mouse
embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) lacking the critical mTORC2
component SIN1. It cannot be inferred from this genetic data
whether acute pharmacological inhibition of mTORC2 would
block the phosphorylation of Akt only at S473, resulting in
partial Akt deactivation, or also disrupt phosphorylation at
T308, resulting complete Akt inhibition.
Several small molecules have been identified that directly
inhibit mTOR by targeting the ATP binding site; these
include LY294002, PI-103, and NVP-BEZ235 [19–22]. These
molecules were originally discovered as inhibitors of PI3Ks
and later shown to also target mTOR. Because all of these
molecules inhibit PI3Ks and mTOR with similar potency, they
cannot be used to selectively inhibit mTOR or PI3Ks in cells.
Indeed, because mTORC1 and mTORC2 function down￾stream of PI3Ks in most settings, it is unclear to what extent
the ability of these molecules to block the activation of
signaling proteins such as Akt reflects PI3K versus mTOR
inhibition. It is possible that some of the functions attributed
to PI3Ks using the classical inhibitor LY294002 are a
consequence of mTOR inhibition [19,23], but it is has not
been possible address this, because small molecules that
inhibit mTOR without inhibiting PI3Ks have not been
available.
We recently reported the synthesis of pyrazolopyrimidines
that inhibit members of the PI3K family, including mTOR
[24]. Two of these molecules, PP242 and PP30, are the first
potent, selective, and ATP-competitive inhibitors of mTOR.
Unlike rapamycin, these molecules inhibit both mTORC1 and
mTORC2, and, unlike PI3K family inhibitors such as
LY294002, these molecules inhibit mTOR with a high degree
of selectivity relative to PI3Ks and protein kinases. To
distinguish these molecules from the allosteric mTORC1
inhibitor rapamycin, we are calling them ‘‘TORKinibs’’ for
TOR kinase domain inhibitors. The dual role of mTOR within
the PI3K!Akt!mTOR pathway as both an upstream
activator of Akt and the downstream effector of pathway
activity on cell growth and proliferation has excited interest
in active-site inhibitors of mTOR [25–30]. We describe here
the biological activity of these molecules.
Another small-molecule ATP-competitive mTOR inhibitor
called Torin1 was reported while our manuscript was in the
process of publication [56].
Results
Specific Active-Site Inhibition of mTOR by the TORKinibs
PP242 and PP30
PP242 and PP30 inhibit mTOR in vitro with half-maximal
inhibitory concentrations (IC50 values) of 8 nM and 80 nM,
respectively. As expected for active-site inhibitors, PP242 and
PP30 inhibit mTOR in both mTORC1 and mTORC2 (Table
S1). Both compounds are selective within the PI3K family,
inhibiting other PI3Ks only at substantially higher concen￾trations (Figure 1). Testing of PP242 against 219 purified
protein kinases at a concentration 100-fold higher than its
mTOR IC50 value revealed exceptional selectivity with respect
to the protein kinome; most protein kinases were unaffected
by this drug, and only four—PKC-alpha, PKC-beta, RET, and
JAK2 (V617F)—were inhibited more than 80% [24]. We
determined IC50 values for PP242 against these kinases in
vitro using purified proteins. In these assays, PP242 was
relatively inactive against PKC-beta, RET, or JAK2 but
inhibited PKC-alpha with an in vitro IC50 of 50 nM (Figure
1). Importantly, PP30 showed no activity against PKC-alpha
or PKC-beta in the same assay (Figure 1). These data indicate
that PP242 is a highly selective inhibitor of mTOR and that
PP30 can be used to confirm that the effects of PP242 are due
to inhibition of mTOR and not PKC-alpha. The availability of
a second structurally dissimilar mTOR inhibitor—PP30—
provides additional control for unanticipated off-targets of
PP242.
Inhibition of mTORC2 and Akt Phosphorylation by
TORKinibs
We characterized the effect of PP242 on the PI3K!Akt!
mTOR pathway. PP242 and PP30 both inhibited insulin￾stimulated phosphorylation of Akt at S473, confirming that
mTOR kinase activity is required for hydrophobic motif
phosphorylation (Figure 2A). The inhibition of mTOR by
PP242 and PP30 also resulted in loss of Akt phosphorylation

mTOR Kinase Domain Inhibitors
Author Summary
Growth factor pathways are required for normal development but
are often inappropriately activated in many cancers. One growth￾factor–sensitive pathway of increasing interest to cancer researchers
relies on the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a kinase that
(like all kinases) delivers phosphate groups from ATP to amino acid
residues of downstream proteins. TOR proteins were first discovered
in yeast as the cellular targets of rapamycin, a small, naturally
occurring molecule derived from bacteria that is widely used as an
immunosuppressant and more recently in some cancer therapies.
The study of TOR proteins has relied heavily on the use of
rapamycin, but rapamycin does not directly inhibit TOR kinase
activity; rather, rapamycin influences TOR’s enzymatic activities by
binding to a domain far from the kinase’s active site. Some mTOR
functions are resistant to rapamycin, as a result of the kinase activity
of one kind of multiprotein complex, the mTOR complex 2
(mTORC2), whereas rapamycin-sensitive functions of mTOR are
due to the mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1). We have developed new
inhibitors of mTOR that bind to the ATP-binding site of mTOR and
inhibit the catalytic activity of both mTORC1 and mTORC2 without
inhibiting other kinases. Unexpectedly, these inhibitors had
profound effects on protein synthesis and cell proliferation due to
their inhibition of mTORC1 rather than mTORC2. We found that the
phosphorylation of a protein that controls protein synthesis, the
mTORC1 substrate 4E binding protein (4EBP) is partially resistant to
rapamycin but fully inhibited by our new inhibitors. The finding that
4EBP phosphorylation is resistant to rapamycin suggests that active￾site inhibitors may be more effective than rapamycin in the
treatment of cancer and may explain why rapamycin is so well
tolerated when taken for immunosuppression.

at T308, but significantly higher doses of PP242 and PP30
were required to inhibit T308 as compared with S473 (Figure
2A and 2B). PP242 inhibited S473-P and T308-P at both early
and late time points after insulin stimulation, indicating that
the differential sensitivity of these sites to PP242 does not
reflect differing kinetics of phosphorylation (Figure S1). By
comparison, the PI3K inhibitor PIK-90, which does not
inhibit mTOR, inhibited the phosphorylation of both Akt
sites equipotently (Figure 2B), as observed previously [21].
We sought to confirm that the loss of T308-P caused by
PP242 and PP30 results from inhibition of mTOR-mediated
phosphorylation of S473, rather than from inhibition of an
off-target kinase, or from an effect of mTOR inhibition
unrelated to S473-P. To do this, we examined the effect of
PP242 on T308 phosphorylation in two situations in which
Akt could not be phosphorylated on S473.
First, we overexpressed S473A mutant Akt and stimulated
these cells with insulin (Figure 3A). S473A Akt was phos￾phorylated on T308 to a similar level as wild-type, yet in
contrast to the wild-type, T308-P on S473A Akt was not
inhibited by PP242. The lack of effect of PP242 on S473A Akt
confirms that PP242 inhibition of pT308 requires S473 and
also that PP242 does not inhibit PDK1 in cells, as was
suggested by direct testing of PDK1 in vitro (Figure 1).
As a further test of the specificity of PP242 and the
requirement for functional S473 phosphorylation in order
for PP242 to inhibit T308-P, we examined the effect of PP242
on the phosphorylation of Akt in primary MEFs from
embryos that lack SIN1 [16] (Figure 3B). SIN1 is a component
of mTORC2, and knockout of SIN1 compromises the physical
integrity of mTORC2 leading to a complete loss of Akt
phosphorylation at S473 without affecting its phosphoryla￾tion at T308. Consistent with our results from L6 cells, PP242
inhibited the phosphorylation of Akt at both S473 and T308
in wild-type MEFs. By contrast, PP242 had no effect on the
phosphorylation of T308 in SIN1/ MEFs that lack mTORC2.
Furthermore, PP242 had no effect on the constitutive
phosphorylation of the turn motif of Akt at T450 [16,31].
As a further comparison, we examined the effect of long-term
rapamycin, which is known to block the assembly of mTORC2
is some cell lines [18]. Similar to PP242, long-term rapamycin
treatment of wild-type MEFs inhibited S473-P and reduced
the phosphorylation of T308-P, as was seen previously [18].
Importantly, the PI3K inhibitor PIK-90 and the PDK1
inhibitor BX-795 [32] blocked phosphorylation of T308 in
SIN1/ MEFs, indicating that the failure of PP242 to block
T308 in SIN1/ MEFs does not reflect a general resistance of
T308 to dephosphorylation in cells that lack mTORC2. From
these data, we conclude that PP2429s effect on T308-P is
dependent on its inhibition of Akt phosphorylation by mTOR
at S473. It remains unclear why mTORC2 knockout cells, but
not cells treated with RNAi or pharmacological inhibitors of
mTORC2, are able to retain T308 phosphorylation in the
absence of phosphorylation at S473. However, there are a
growing number of examples in which genetic deletion of a
kinase results in compensatory changes that mask relevant
phenotypes observed with the corresponding small molecule
inhibitor [33].
Akt Substrate Phosphorylation Is Only Modestly Inhibited
by PP242
Akt requires phosphorylation at both S473 and T308 for
full biochemical activity in vitro [13], but it is unclear whether
all of the cellular functions of Akt require it to be dually
phosphorylated. Singly phosphorylated (T308-P) Akt from
SIN1/ MEFs is competent to phosphorylate the cytoplasmic
Akt substrates GSK3 and TSC2, but not the nuclear target
FoxO [16]. Because low concentrations of PP242 inhibit the
phosphorylation of S473 and higher concentrations partially
inhibit T308-P in addition to S473-P, we used PP242 to
examine whether some substrates of Akt are especially
sensitive to loss of S473-P (Figure 4). We compared PP242
to the PI3K inhibitor PIK-90 and the allosteric Akt inhibitor
Akti-1/2 [34], which inhibit the phosphorylation of Akt at
both sites. In contrast to PIK-90 and Akti-1/2, which
completely inhibited the phosphorylation of Akt and its
direct substrates, PP242 only partially inhibited the phos￾phorylation of cytoplasmic and nuclear substrates of Akt.
This suggests that phosphorylation of the Akt substrates we
examined is only modestly sensitive to loss of S473-P. A caveat
of comparing Akt substrates in Sin1/ MEFs with PP242-
treated cells is the different turn motif (T450-P) status in
these two conditions (Figure 3B).

mTOR Kinase Domain Inhibitors

In contrast to Akt, which maintains T308-P, SGK activity is
completely inhibited by genetic disruption of mTORC2 [7].
Because SGK can phosphorylate FoxO and its activity is
completely inhibited by disruption of mTORC2, it was
suggested that the loss of FoxO phosphorylation in SIN1/
MEFs indicates that FoxO is primarily phosphorylated by
SGK rather than Akt [7]. Because Akti-1/2 does not inhibit
SGK [34] but inhibits FoxO1/O3a phosphorylation at T24/T32
in L6 myotubes (Figure 4), our data suggests that the major
kinase for T24/T32 of FoxO1/O3a in L6 myotubes is Akt and
not SGK.
PP242 Does Not Have an Obvious Effect on Actin Stress
Fibers
TORC2 is required for the generation of a polarized actin
cytoskeleton in yeast [35]. Previous analysis of mTORC2
function using RNAi revealed a role for mTORC2 in the
control of the actin cytoskeleton [3,4], yet these findings were
not confirmed in primary MEFs lacking mTORC2 [15,17]. We

examined actin stress fibers in NIH 3T3 cells (Figure 5) and in
primary MEFs (unpublished data) treated with PP242. After
8 h of treatment with PP242, we found no obvious effect on
the morphology or abundance of actin stress fibers (Figure 5),
suggesting that mTORC2 activity is not required for the
maintenance of actin stress fibers in these cells. That PP242
didn’t obviously affect the morphology or abundance of actin
stress fibers, does not rule out a role for mTOR in the control
of the actin cytoskeleton, but it does show that pharmaco￾logical inhibition of mTORC2 does not affect the obvious
changes in actin structure seen with RNAi.
PP242 Inhibits Proliferation More Completely Than
Rapamycin
We next measured the effect of dual mTORC1/mTORC2
inhibition by PP242 on the proliferation of primary MEFs

mTOR Kinase Domain Inhibitors

(Figure 5B). For this analysis, we compared PP242 to selective
mTORC1 inhibition by rapamycin. Rapamycin was tested at
concentrations above its mTOR IC50, and at all concen￾trations tested, it inhibited growth to the same extent. By
contrast, PP242 had a dose-dependent effect on proliferation
and at higher doses was much more effective than rapamycin
at blocking cell proliferation. The ability of PP242 to block
cell proliferation more efficiently than rapamycin could be a
result of its ability to inhibit mTORC1 and mTORC2, because
rapamycin can only inhibit mTORC1. To test this possibility,
we measured the effects of both compounds on the
proliferation of SIN1/ MEFs, which lack mTORC2. In
SIN1/ MEFs, rapamycin was also less effective at blocking
cell proliferation than PP242. That PP242 and rapamycin
exhibit very different anti-proliferative effects in SIN1/
MEFs suggests that the two compounds differentially affect
mTORC1.
Rapamycin-Resistant mTORC1
mTORC1 regulates protein synthesis by phosphorylating
the hydrophobic motif of p70S6-Kinase (S6K) at T389 and the
eIF4E-binding-protein, 4EBP1, at multiple sites. Our prolif￾eration experiments suggest that rapamycin and PP242 have
distinct effects on mTORC1. We compared the effects of
acute treatment with rapamycin and PP242 on S6K,
ribosomal protein S6 (S6), and 4EBP1 phosphorylation
(Figure 6A) to see if these inhibitors differentially affect the
phosphorylation of these canonical substrates of mTORC1.
Both rapamycin and PP242 inhibited the phosphorylation of
S6K and its substrate S6, and neither rapamycin nor PP242
affected the phosphorylation of 4EBP1 on T70 (Figure S2A).
In contrast, PP242 fully inhibited the phosphorylation of
4EBP1 at T36/45 and S65, whereas rapamycin only had a
modest affect on these same phosphorylations. Treatment of
cells with PP30 was also effective at reducing the phosphor￾ylation of 4EBP1 at T36/45 (Figure S3), indicating that the
block of T36/45 phosphorylation by PP242 is due to its
inhibition of mTOR and not PKC-alpha. PIK-90 did not
reduce the phosphorylation of 4EBP1 at T36/45, demonstrat￾ing that inhibition of PI3K and Akt activation alone is not
sufficient to block the phosphorylation of 4EBP1 at T36/45
(Figure S3).
The enhanced dephosphorylation of 4EBP1 caused by
PP242 as compared with rapamycin could be due to
incomplete inhibition of mTORC1 by rapamycin or involve￾ment of mTORC2 in the phosphorylation of 4EBP1. To
examine these alternatives, we analyzed the effect of PP242
and rapamycin on the phosphorylation of 4EBP1 in SIN1/
MEFs that lack mTORC2 (Figure 6B). SIN1/ MEFS showed
higher levels of p4EBP1, suggesting that due to the lack of
mTORC2, these cells have more mTORC1 activity, although
stronger S6K phosphorylation in wild-type cells contradicts
this simple interpretation. Despite an increase in p4EBP1 in
SIN1/ compared with wild-type MEFs, shorter exposures of
the p4EBP1 blots (Figure S2B) show that PP242 inhibits
p4EBP1 with the same potency in both cells. The fuller
inhibition of p4EBP1 by PP242 than by rapamycin in wild￾type and SIN1/ MEFs indicates that the presence of
mTORC2 is not required for rapamycin and PP242 to have
distinct effects on 4EBP1 phosphorylation, and suggests that
PP242 is a more complete inhibitor of mTORC1 than
rapamycin.
Inhibition of Translation by TORKinibs
While the precise role of S6K in translation control is still
poorly understood, it is known that the hypophosphorylated
4EBP1 protein acts as negative regulator of the major cap￾binding protein eIF4E. We directly assessed the effect of
PP242 on cap-dependent translation downstream of mTOR
activation. The phosphorylation of 4EBP1 by mTOR in
response to growth factor and nutrient status causes it to
dissociate from eIF4E allowing eIF4G and associated factors
to bind to the 5’ cap, recruit the 40S subunit of the ribosome,
and scan the mRNA for the start codon to initiate translation.
The phosphorylation of 4EBP1 by mTOR is complicated in
that it occurs at multiple sites, and not all sites are equally
effective at causing dissociation of 4EBP1 from eIF4E [36].
Furthermore, a hierarchy is thought to exist whereby the N￾terminal threonine phosphorylations at 36/45 precede and
are required for the C-terminal phosphorylations at S65 and
T70 [37,38]. Phosphorylation at S65 causes the greatest
decrease in affinity of 4EBP1 for eIF4E [39,40], and S65 is
probably the most important site in cells for dissociation of
4EBP1 from eIF4E [41], but other sites are also important
[36,42].
We examined the effect of PP242 on the active eIF4E

initiation complex of translation by using a cap-binding assay.
eIF4E binds tightly to beads coated with the cap analogue 7-
methyl GTP (m7
GTP), allowing proteins bound to eIF4E to be
examined. Rapamycin caused partial inhibition of the insulin￾stimulated release of 4EPB1 from eIF4E (Figure 7A), consis￾tent with its partial inhibition of S65 phosphorylation (Figure
6A). The rapamycin-induced retention of 4EBP1 was accom￾panied by a loss of recovery of eIF4G, because the binding of
4EBP1 and eIF4G to eIF4E are mutually exclusive. In contrast,
treatment with PP242 caused a much larger retention of
4EBP1, raising the retention of 4EBP1 above the level seen in
unstimulated serum-starved cells, which are known to have
low levels of protein translation [43].
Translation initiation depending on eIF4E activity is the
rate-limiting step in cap-dependent protein translation [44].
PP242 caused a higher level of binding between 4EBP1 and
eIF4E than rapamycin (Figure 6A), suggesting that cap￾dependent translation will be more highly suppressed by
PP242 than by rapamycin. To quantify the efficiency of cap￾dependent translation in the presence of PP242 and
rapamycin, we used the well-established bicistronic reporter
assay where translation initiation of the first cistron is
dependent on the 59 cap, whereas initiation of the second
cistron depends on a viral internal ribosome entry site (IRES)
that bypasses the need for cap-binding proteins such as eIF4E
[45]. PP242 caused a significant decrease in cap-dependent,
but not IRES-dependent (Figure S4), translation, whereas
rapamycin did not have a statistically significant effect on
cap-dependent translation (Figure 7B), consistent with the
modest effect of rapamycin on 4EBP1 phosphorylation
(Figure 6A). Based on this assay, inhibition of mTOR and
p4EBP1 reduces cap-dependent translation by about 30%,
suggesting that cap-dependent translation is only partially
inhibited by hypophosphorylated 4EBP1. The majority of
protein synthesis is thought to be cap-dependent [44], and
consistent with this we find that PP242 also reduces total
protein synthesis by about 30%, whereas rapamycin does not

the effects of loss of mTOR in animals. To begin to explore
the tissue specific roles of mTORC1 and mTORC2 and
confirm the pathway analysis from cell culture experiments,
we treated mice with PP242 and rapamycin and examined the
acute effect of these drugs on insulin signaling in fat, skeletal
muscle, and liver tissue (Figure 8). In fat and liver, PP242 was
able to completely inhibit the phosphorylation of Akt at S473
and T308, consistent with its effect on these phosphorylation

sites observed in cell culture. Surprisingly, PP242 was only
partially able to inhibit the phosphorylation of Akt in skeletal
muscle and was more effective at inhibiting the phosphor￾ylation of T308 than S473, despite it’s ability to fully inhibit
the phosphorylation of 4EBP1 and S6. These results will be
confirmed by in vivo dose-response experiments, but,
consistent with the partial effect of PP242 on pAkt in skeletal
muscle, a muscle-specific knockout of the integral mTORC2

component rictor resulted in only a partial loss of Akt
phosphorylation at S473 [46]. These results suggest that a
kinase other than mTOR, such as DNA-PK [8,9], may
contribute to phosphorylation of Akt in muscle.
Rapamycin often stimulates the phosphorylation of Akt
[47,48], probably by relieving feedback inhibition from S6K to
the insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) [49], a key signaling
molecule that links activation of the insulin receptor to PI3K
activation. In all tissues examined, and especially in fat and
muscle, acute rapamycin treatment activated the phosphor￾ylation of Akt at S473 and T308 (Figure 8). In contrast to
rapamycin, by inhibiting both mTORC2 and mTORC1, PP242
suppresses rather than enhances Akt activation.
As was seen in cell culture, rapamycin and PP242 also
differentially affect the mTORC1 substrates S6K and 4EBP1
in vivo. S6 phosphorylation was fully inhibited by rapamycin
and PP242 in all tissues examined. While PP242 was effective
at blocking the phosphorylation of 4EBP1 on both T36/45 and
S65 in all tissues examined, rapamycin did not block 4EBP1
phosphorylation as completely as PP242. Further experi￾ments will be required to identify the mechanism by which
4EBP1 phosphorylation is partially resistant to rapamycin.
Discussion
Rapamycin has been a powerful pharmacological tool
allowing the discovery of mTOR’s role in the control of
protein synthesis. Since the discovery of a rapamycin￾insensitive mTOR complex, there has been a significant
effort to develop pharmacological tools for studying this
complex. We have used two structurally distinct compounds
to pharmacologically dissect the effects of mTOR kinase
inhibition toward mTORC1 and mTORC2 activity.
We have shown through the use of these inhibitors that the
inhibition of mTOR kinase activity is sufficient to prevent the
phosphorylation of Akt at S473, providing further evidence
that mTORC2 is the kinase responsible for Akt hydrophobic
motif phosphorylation upon insulin stimulation. We also find
that phosphorylation at T308 is linked to phosphorylation at
S473, as had been observed in experiments where mTORC2
was disabled by RNAi and long-term rapamycin, but not
homologous recombination. Surprisingly however, inhibition
of mTORC2 does not result in a complete block of Akt
signaling, as T308P is partially maintained and Akt substrate
phosphorylation is only modestly affected when S473 is not
phosphorylated.
Despite its modest effect on Akt substrate phosphorylation,
PP242 was a strikingly more effective anti-proliferative agent
than rapamycin. These results were reproduced even in cells
lacking mTORC2 (SIN1/), suggesting that downstream
mTORC1 substrates might be responsible for PP2429s strong
anti-proliferative effects. Interestingly, we observe that
phosphorylation of the mTORC1 substrate 4EBP1 is partially
resistant to rapamycin treatment at concentrations that fully
inhibit S6K, whereas PP242 completely inhibits both S6K and
4EBP1. Because rapamycin can only partially inhibit the
phosphorylation of 4EBP1, but it can fully in inhibit the
phosphorylation of S6K, rapamycin appears to be a substrate￾selective inhibitor of mTORC1. Consistent with this finding,
experiments with purified proteins have shown that rapamy￾cin/FKBP12 only partially inhibits the in vitro phosphoryla￾tion of 4EBP1 at Ser 65 by mTOR but can fully inhibit the in
vitro phosphorylation of S6K [50]. By contrast, LY294002, a
direct inhibitor of many PI3K family members including
mTOR, was equally effective at inhibiting the phosphoryla￾tion of S6K and 4EBP1 by mTOR in vitro [50] and in cells [23],
although this finding is complicated by LY2940029s inhibition
of multiple lipid and protein kinases [51] including PIM, a
kinase potentially upstream of 4EBP1 phosphorylation
[52,53]. These results argue that PP242, in addition to being
useful for investigating mTORC2, can reveal rapamycin￾resistant components of mTORC1 function. Indeed, prolif￾Figure 8. PP242 Inhibits mTORC2 and Rapamycin-Resistant mTORC1 In Vivo

eration of SIN1/ MEFs is more sensitive to PP242 than
rapamycin (Figure 5B), suggesting that rapamycin-resistant
functions of mTORC1, including the aspects of translation
initiation highlighted in Figure 7, are key to the anti￾proliferative effects of PP242. Furthermore, our findings
suggest that the inhibition of translational control and the
anti-proliferative effects of PP242 require inhibition of
4EBP1 phosphorylation and eIF4E activity.
Using TORKinibs to acutely inhibit mTOR has surprisingly
led to the identification of outputs from mTORC1 that are
rapamycin-resistant. These observations should motivate
further studies aimed at understanding how rapamycin is
able to selectively affect different outputs downstream of
mTORC1. As active site inhibitors of mTOR join rapamycin
and its analogs in the clinic [22,27,30], it will be important to
understand the distinct effects of these pharmacological
agents on cellular and organismal physiology and to evaluate
their efficacy in the treatment of disease and cancer caused
by hyperactivation of the PI3K!Akt!TOR pathway.
Materials and Methods
Ethics statement. Mice were handled in accordance with protocols
approved by the committee for animal research at the University of
California San Francisco, United States of America.
Cell culture. Cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10%
FBS, glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin. Confluent L6 myoblasts
were differentiated into myotubes by culturing them for 5 d in
medium containing 2% FBS. L6 myotubes were maintained in
medium containing 2% FBS until use. Primary wild-type MEFs used
in Figure 7 were isolated at embryonic day 13.5 as previously
described [54]. Primary SIN1/ MEFs and matching wild-type
controls were provided by B. Su and isolated as previously described
[16].
Cell lysis and Western blotting. Except where indicated otherwise,
cells were serum starved overnight and incubated with inhibitors or
0.1% DMSO for 30 min prior to stimulation with 100 nM insulin for
10 min. All inhibitors were either synthesized as previously described
[21,24,55] or were from Calbiochem (rapamycin and Akti-1/2). Cells
were lysed by scraping into ice cold lysis buffer followed by brief
sonication. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation, resolved by SDS￾PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and immunoblotted with anti￾bodies from Cell Signaling Technology. Unless otherwise indicated,
cells were lysed in 300 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 5 mM EDTA, 1%
Triton X-100, 0.02% NaN3, 20 nM microcystin (Calbiochem), Sigma
phosphatase inhibitor cocktails 1 and 2, Roche protease inhibitor
cocktail, and 2 mM PMSF. For Figures 6A and 7A, and Figure S2A,
cells were lysed in cap lysis buffer (140 mM KCl, 10 mM Tris pH 7.5, 1
mM EDTA, 4 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 1% NP-40, 20 nM microcystin,
Sigma phosphatase inhibitor cocktails 1 and 2, Roche protease
inhibitor cocktail without EDTA and 2 mM PMSF).
Cap pull-down assay. L6 myotubes from one well of a six-well plate
were lysed in 300 ll of cap lysis buffer as described above. 50 ll of
detergent-free cap lysis buffer and 20 ll of pre-washed cap beads
were added to 150 ll of cleared lysate and incubated at 4 8C overnight
with tumbling. The beads were washed twice with 400 ll of cap wash
buffer (cap lysis buffer with 0.5% NP-40 instead of 1% NP-40) and
twice with 500 ll of PBS. The beads were boiled in SDS-PAGE sample
buffer and the retained proteins analyzed by Western blot. All
antibodies were from Cell Signaling Technologies except for the anti￾eIF4E antibody, which was from BD Biosciences.
Kinase assays. Phosphorylation of histone H1 (4 lM) by PKC was
assayed in a buffer containing 200 ng/ml recombinant kinase, 25 mM
HEPES pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl2, 5 mM ß-glycerol phosphate, 0.05 mg/ml
phosphatidylserine, 0.03% Triton X-100, 0.5 mg/ml BSA, 2.5 mM
DTT, 100 lM CaCl2, 1 lM PMA, 10 lM ATP, and 15 lCi/ml of c￾32P￾ATP. Inhibitors were tested in a four-fold dilution series from 10 lM
to 600 pM, and four measurements were made at each concentration.
The kinase reaction was terminated by spotting onto nitrocellulose,
which was washed 5 times with 1 M NaCl/1% phosphoric acid. The
radioactivity remaining on the nitrocellulose sheet was quantified by
phosphorimaging, and IC50 values were determined by fitting the
data to a sigmoidal dose-response curve using the Prism software
package.
PDK1, mTORC1, and mTORC2 were assayed as previously
described [21].
In-cell Western. L6 myotubes were grown and differentiated in 96-
well plates. The outside wells of the plate were not used for the
experiment, but were kept filled with media. Following stimulation,
cells were fixed for 15 min with 4% formaldehyde in PBS with Caþþ
and Mgþþ. The cells were washed three times with PBS and the
blocked and permeabilized with 5% goat serum in PBS with 0.3%
Triton X-100 (PBS-GS-TX). Primary antibodies to S473 (Cell Signal￾ing #4060) and T308 (Cell Signaling #2965) were added at 1:1000 and
1:500, respectively, in PBS-GS-TX, and the plates were incubated at 4
8C overnight. The plates were then washed three times with PBS, and
goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Pierce Biotechnology) was
added at 0.01 lg/ml in PBS-GS-TX. After 1 h at room temperature,
plates were washed three times with PBS. ELISA chemiluminescent
reagent (Femto, Pierce Biotechnology) was added to each well and
after 1 min, the plate was read in a luminescence plate reader using a
100-ms integration time. The pAkt signal from pT308 and pS473 was
normalized to control wells, so that 0 represents the level of pAkt in
serum starved cells and 1 represents the level upon insulin
stimulation. EC50 values were determined by fitting the data to a
sigmoidal dose-response curve using the Prism software package. The
significance of differences between EC50 values was evaluated using
the F test.
Akt transfection. Akt was transfected into HEK293 cells using
Lipofectamine 2000 according the manufacturers protocol. Two days
after transfection, cells were serum starved overnight and the next
day they were treated with inhibitors and processed for western
blotting as described above.
Actin cytoskeleton staining. NIH 3T3 cells were plated on poly￾lysine coated coverslips at 30% confluence the day before the
experiment. Following treatment with PP242 or 0.1% DMSO for 8 h
in 10% serum growth medium, the actin cytoskeleton was stained as
previously described [24].
Bicistronic reporter assay. Primary MEFs were transfected with a
bicistronic reporter [54] containing a viral IRES using Lipofectamine
2000 according to the manufacturers protocol. At 2 d post
transfection, cells were treated overnight with compounds as
indicated or starved of serum. The next day, Renilla and Firefly
luciferase activity were measured using the Dual-Luciferase kit
(Promega). Differences in the ratio of Renilla to Firefly luciferase
signals were analyzed for statistical significance by one-way ANOVA
with Tukey’s post test using the Prism software package. 35S labeling of new protein synthesis. Primary MEFs grown to 70%
confluence in six-well plates were incubated overnight in either 10%
Serum (Steady State), kinase inhibitors in 10% serum, or 0.1% serum
(starved). Cells were then washed once with DMEM lacking cysteine
and methionine (DMEM-noS), and the medium was replaced with
DMEM-noS including dialyzed serum and kinase inhibitors as
indicated. After incubation for 1 h, 50 lCi of Expre35S35S (NEN)
was added to each well and the cells were labeled for 4 h. Cells were
washed once with ice-cold PBS, and lysed as described above for
Western blotting. Following separation by SDS-PAGE, and transfer to
nitrocellulose, 35S-labeled proteins were visualized by autoradiog￾raphy with film. For quantitation, the membrane was exposed to a
phosphorimager screen and the resulting image was quantified in
ImageJ. Differences in 35S incorporation were analyzed for statistical
significance by one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post test using the
Prism software package.
In vivo drug treatment and Western blotting. Drugs were prepared
in 100 ll of vehicle containing 20% DMSO, 40% PEG-400, and 40%
saline. Six-wk-old male C57BL/6 mice were fasted overnight prior to
drug treatment. PP242 (0.4 mg), rapamycin (0.1 mg), or vehicle alone
was injected IP. After 30 min for the rapamycin-treated mouse or 10
min for the PP242 and vehicle-treated mice, 250 mU of insulin in 100
ll of saline was injected IP. 15 min after the insulin injection, the
mice were killed by CO2 asphyxiation followed by cervical disloca￾tion. Tissues were harvested and frozen on liquid nitrogen in 200 ll
of cap lysis buffer. The frozen tissue was thawed on ice, manually
disrupted with a mortar and pestle, and then further processed with a
micro tissue-homogenizer (Fisher PowerGen 125 with Omni-Tip
probe). Protein concentration of the cleared lysate was measured by
Bradford assay and 5–10 lg of protein was analyzed by Western blot
as described above.
Cell proliferation assay. Wild-type and SIN1/ MEFs were plated
in 96-well plates at approximately 30% confluence and left overnight
to adhere. The following day cells were treated with PP242,
rapamycin, or vehicle (0.1% DMSO). After 72 h of treatment, 10 ll
of 440 lM resazurin sodium salt (Sigma) was added to each well, and
after 18 h, the florescence intensity in each well was measured using a
