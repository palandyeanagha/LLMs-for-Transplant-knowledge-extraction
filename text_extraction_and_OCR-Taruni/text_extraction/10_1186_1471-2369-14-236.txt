Abstract
Background: Glomerulonephritis (GN) is a group of rare kidney diseases with a substantial health burden and high
risk of progression to end-stage renal disease. Research in GN has been limited by poor availability of large
comprehensive registries. Substantial variations in access to and administration of treatment and outcomes in GN
have been described. Leveraging provincial resources and existing infrastructure, the British Columbia (BC) GN
Network is an initiative which serves to combine research and clinical care objectives. The goal of the BC GN
Network is to coordinate and improve health care, including robust data capture, on all patients with GN in BC, a
Canadian province of over 4.6 million people. This provincial initiative will serve as a model for Canadian or other
national and international endeavours.
Description: The BC Provincial Renal Agency (BCPRA) is the provincial governmental agency responsible for health
delivery for all kidney patients in BC. The BC GN Network has been created by the BCPRA to ensure high quality
and equitable access to care for all patients with GN and is a platform for evidence based clinical care programs
and associated health policy. All patients with biopsy-proven GN are registered at the time of kidney biopsy into
the BCPRA provincial database of kidney disease patients, forming the BC GN Registry. Thereafter, all laboratory
results and renal related outcomes are captured automatically. Histology data and core clinical variables are
entered into the database. Additional linkages between the GN Registry and administrative databases ensure robust
capture of medications, hospital admissions, health care utilization, comorbidities, cancer and cardiac outcomes,
and vital statistics.
Conclusions: The BC GN Network and Registry is a unique model in that it combines robust data capture, data
linkages, and health care delivery and evaluation into one integrated system. This model utilizes existing health
infrastructure to prospectively capture population level data on patients with GN, producing a rich dataset capable
of real-time identification and evaluation of GN health policy initiatives, of supporting observational cohort studies
and health services research in GN, and of facilitating patient recruitment into GN clinical trials.

Background
While glomerulonephritis (GN) is considered a group of
rare diseases, with an incidence of 0.7-2.8 per 100000/
year depending on the specific type of GN, collectively
they may consume substantial health care resources
[1,2]. The risk of progression to end-stage renal disease
(ESRD) is high, between 20-50%, such that GN is the
second most common cause of ESRD in Canada [3-9].
Further, there is additional morbidity and cost associated
with the treatment of GN, related both to expensive
immunosuppressive medications, and infectious, ma￾lignancy or other complications of treatment. Conse￾quently, the burden of GN to the health care system is
substantial.
Due to the rarity of GN, registries that sample large
geographic regions, and thus large numbers of patients,
are required for collection of sufficient data to evaluate
and improve health policy and systems of care for GN
patients, and to facilitate clinic outcomes research in
glomerular diseases [1,10]. The infrequent nature of the
disease contributes to the poor understanding of these
conditions by individual clinicians who may be exposed
to small numbers of patients. Similar to cancer registries,
the potential benefits of central registration of GN pa￾tients into regional databases may include enhanced
physician collaboration resulting in improved patient
care [1]. The absence of such registries significantly
limits the understanding of the natural history of GN
and the recruitment of GN patients into clinical trials, and
thus impedes research and results in a void of evidence￾based treatment recommendations. While existing GN
registries have substantially contributed to the advance￾ment of GN research, they are often research-based data￾bases limited in their recruitment scope, expensive and
labour-intensive to maintain, and not well integrated into
patient care. Given these limitations they are not likely to
be sustainable in the long-term.
The British Columbia (BC) GN Network and Registry
has been created to address the limitations of other
registries by leveraging existing health services infra￾structure and data capture to facilitate and coordinate
the care of all patients with GN in BC, a Canadian
province of over 4.6 million people with a universal
health care system. The components of the BC GN
Network include the creation of a formal GN Registry
embedded within an existing provincial information
system, and the creation of an advisory group of rele￾vant stakeholders including physicians, researchers,
pharmacists, nurses and analysts, with direct responsi￾bility for the administration of the BC GN Network
and accountability for its outcomes. Both the database
and the advisory group utilize existing infrastructure
and processes within a larger provincial kidney dis￾ease network.
Overarching goals of the BC GN Network
1. To create a sustainable framework for knowledge
translation, policy development and implementation
of best practice management through the systematic
collection and analysis of data
2. To identify, implement and evaluate clinical care
programs and health policy initiatives that improve
the care of patients with GN in BC in a financially
sustainable fashion.
3. To promote clinical outcomes, health policy and
health services research in the field of GN.
4. To ensure knowledge translation of such
initiatives to key stakeholders, including patients
and physicians.
Specific goals of the BC GN Registry
1. To prospectively capture at the time of kidney
biopsy all relevant clinical, laboratory, pathology
and outcome data in GN patients.
2. To collate data regarding the incidence, prevalence,
outcomes, and health care utilization of patients
with GN.
3. To capture such data using a sustainable
infrastructure that leverages existing administrative
resources.
4. To ensure high quality data is available to identify,
develop and evaluate new clinical care and health
policy initiatives targeting patients with GN.
5. To provide a rich dataset capable of supporting
clinical outcomes and health services research in
the field of GN.
Construction and content
The provincial infrastructure for chronic kidney disease
in BC
The BC Provincial Renal Agency (BCPRA) is a govern￾mental organization that coordinates, monitors and
funds the delivery of care to patients with kidney disease
in BC (www.bcrenalagency.ca). The mandate of the
BCPRA is to improve the quality of life and outcomes
for patients with renal disease, and to promote a fiscally
sustainable health care system. The BCPRA operates the
Patient Records and Outcomes Management Information
System (PROMIS), which is a provincial database of all pa￾tients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) in BC. PROMIS
is an Oracle-based web-accessible database with over
10000 patient-records that was initiated in 2000 and cap￾tures patients with CKD, defined as evidence of kidney
damage either with an estimated (e)GFR <60 ml/min/
1.73 m2
, or structural abnormalities on imaging or kidney
biopsy. Registration in PROMIS is mandatory for funding
of CKD medications (such as erythropoietin stimulating
Barbour et al. BMC Nephrology 2013, 14:236 Page 2 of 8

agents, phosphate binders or vitamin D analogues), access
to multidisciplinary care teams, or to receive renal repla￾cement therapy including dialysis and transplantation. As
such, PROMIS serves as a central source of data for all
patients seen by nephrologists or kidney care teams in BC.
PROMIS interfaces with all laboratory systems in the
province, which permits automatic data capture and up￾load into a central database. Clinical data captured in
PROMIS includes comorbidities, medications, blood
pressure, weight and height. Funding is in place for data
capture and formal data quality checks.
While technically able to register any patient with GN,
PROMIS was not specifically designed as a database for
patients with glomerular diseases who often have normal
eGFR. Review of existing biopsy databases identified that
approximately 66% of patients with IgA nephropathy
and 25% of those with pauci-immune glomerulonephritis
are not registered in PROMIS, which may be related to
preserved renal function in a subgroup of patients, or a
competing risk of death preventing registration [11].
Further, GN patients in BC have historically been regis￾tered late in the course of their disease when renal func￾tion has significantly declined, with little historical data
available between the time of kidney biopsy and the de￾velopment of compromised kidney function requiring
access to “CKD resources”. The BC GN Network and
Registry utilizes the existing infrastructure at both the
BCPRA and PROMIS to capture data on patients with
biopsy-proven GN as of the time of kidney biopsy.
The structure of the BC GN Network
The BC GN Network is an initiative of the BCPRA that
coordinates and evaluates the care of patients with GN
in BC, with 5 geographical health authorities with more
than 70 nephrologists. The BC GN Network has an estab￾lished set of terms of reference (see Additional file 1), and
is comprised of a formal steering committee of stake￾holders interested in GN, including physicians, resear￾chers, pharmacists, nurses and data analysts. To maintain
integration within the larger provincial renal community,
the steering committee has reporting obligations to the
nephrology research unit within the University of
British Columbia and to administrative committees
within the BCPRA, including the Executive Commit￾tee, the Medical Advisory Committee, the Pharmacy
and Formulary Committee, and the Information Man￾agement Council.
The BC GN Network focuses on several domains of
GN-related health care as outlined in Table 1. This in￾cludes developing and evaluating health policy in GN,
encouraging clinical and health services research in
glomerular diseases, engaging key stakeholders of the
renal community, and improving education and know￾ledge translation to end users. In addition, a significant
activity of the BC GN Network is the implementation
and oversight of the BC GN Registry to collect data
necessary to support the goals of the BC GN Network.

The BC GN Registry
As of March 1st 2013, the BC GN Registry prospectively
captures data on all patients with GN in BC as of the
time of kidney biopsy, with data storage in PROMIS. It
is comprised of a combination of existing BCPRA re￾sources, a new pathology database initiative, data extrac￾tion of key clinical variables, and the ability to link with
administrative datasets to capture outcomes of interest
(see Figure 1). The structure of the BC GN Network and
Registry is shown in Figure 2.
Integration of provincial and regional pathology databases
into PROMIS
All renal biopsies in BC are interpreted at two centres:
the Royal Jubilee Hospital in Victoria, which processes
all biopsies performed on Vancouver Island, and the BC
Renal Pathology Laboratory based in Vancouver, which
processes all biopsies in the remainder of the province.
Prior to the 2013 launch of this initiative, each centre
previously maintained independent locally managed pa￾thology databases. These have been replaced with a
single centralized pathology database within PROMIS
containing key histologic variables from each biopsy per￾formed (see Table 2). During the initial phase of the BC
GN Network, histologic data from the pathology reports
is being manually entered into PROMIS by trained data
analysts. Development of a robust user-interface is on￾going and will permit pathologists to enter data directly
at the time of biopsy interpretation, reducing duplication
of data entry and ensuring seamless access to key data.
Registration in the BC GN Registry
The inclusion criterion of the BC GN Registry is the
diagnosis on renal biopsy of any glomerular disease
found in Table 3. The diagnosis of GN results in auto￾matic registration in PROMIS and the BC GN Registry,
which triggers a set of activities that ensure consistent
capture of essential data. Patients with other types of
biopsy-proven renal diseases, such as diabetes, hyper￾tensive nephrosclerosis or interstitial nephritis are not
included in the GN registry. These patients are however
captured in the provincial pathology database.
Anticipated incidence of GN in BC
A review of existing pathology databases permits an esti￾mate of the anticipated yearly incidence of GN in BC.
During the 12-year prior from 2000–2012, there were
3473 cases of the common glomerular diseases, with an
average of 289 cases per year (see Table 4). The most fre￾quent types of GN in BC are lupus nephritis (62 cases
per year), IgA nephropathy (69 cases per year), and focal
segmental glomeruloslerosis (70 cases per year).
Capture of full laboratory data
Because the BC GN Registry is embedded within PRO￾MIS, once the patient is registered all laboratory results
are automatically uploaded through established and sanc￾tioned interfaces between PROMIS and provincial labora￾tory systems (see above). Relevant laboratory results for
patients with glomerular diseases, such as proteinuria,
albumin, cholesterol, creatinine, and autoimmune and
infectious disease serology are captured at whatever fre￾quency they are ordered by the primary physician.
As part of a province-wide eGFR reporting initia￾tive, creatinine measurements at all laboratories in BC
have been calibrated using an isotope dilution mass
spectrometry (IDMS) reference standard and used in
the IDMS traceable version of the MDRD formula
[13]. As such, all creatinine measurements and eGFR
estimates are standardized and directly comparable
across laboratories.

Capture of clinical data
Date of birth, sex, and geographic location are required
at the time of registration in PROMIS. Additional clin￾ical data is captured from the primary nephrologists in
accordance with best practices and existing technologies.
The clinical variables that are collected are as follows:
comorbidities, medications, blood pressure, height and
weight. While these variables are not extensive, they
represent a balance between feasibility and cost, with the
minimum data required to accurately describe a cohort
of patients with GN. The same data is collected for all
CKD, ESRD, and kidney transplant patients as part of
the provincial mandate of the BCPRA.

Capture of renal outcomes and mortality
There is complete capture of patient enrollment in CKD
clinics, timing and type of ESRD modality, transplant
outcomes and mortality as part of the provincial man￾date and existing infrastructure. Only those patients who
move out of province are lost to follow up. Therefore,
these outcomes will be available for all patients in the
BC GN Registry.
Data security and integrity
The BC GN Registry is contained within PROMIS,
which is an administrative health care database that
stores fully identified patient-level data and is managed
by the BCPRA under regulation by the provincial
government of BC. It is a fully encrypted Oracle-based
database, with regular backup to both servers and mag￾netic tapes. All users have access only to data deemed
necessary for their clinical and/or administrative posi￾tions, and require secure passwords for login. All suc￾cessful and unsuccessful login attempts and data entry
events are tracked. The security systems and practices
for PROMIS are similar to those used for other govern￾mental health care agencies in BC.
Linkage of the BC GN Registry with other administrative
databases
Each person in BC has a unique Personal Health Number
(PHN), which is required for registration into PROMIS
and is therefore captured by the BC GN Registry at the
time of kidney biopsy. Using the PHN, the BC GN Regis￾try has been linked to various other governmental admin￾istrative databases. Examples include the BC Cardiac
Registry to identify angiographic or surgical cardiac inter￾ventions; the BC Cancer Agency to identify malignancy
events; PharmaNet to capture all medications dispensed at
out-patient pharmacies in the province; the Canadian
Institute of Health Information Discharge Abstract Data￾base to identify hospital admissions, discharge diagnoses
and comorbidities; the Medical Services Plan to identify
all visits to physicians; and the Vital Statistics Database for
cause and date of death. This is shown in Figure 1.
Processes and procedures for this linkage will be in
accordance with all privacy legislation, and differ depend￾ing on the purpose of data usage.
Utility and discussion
British Columbia is a Canadian province with over 4.6
million inhabitants and approximately 289 cases of GN
per year. This represents a substantial incidence of
patients who consume significant health care resources
and are at increased risk of progression to ESRD. Prior to
this initiative, as is the case in many other national and
international jurisdictions, in BC there was no consistent
formalized framework or data capture to inform the care
of patients with GN. Thus, despite the large number of
incident and prevalent GN patients, there has been little
published data on short and long-term outcomes.
The BC GN Network and Registry represents a novel
approach of integrating prospective data collection on
GN patients into a provincial clinical care program for
glomerular diseases, which will facilitate the develop￾ment and evaluation of health policy and health services
initiatives aimed at improving the outcomes of patients
with GN. The BC GN Network is a provincial initiative
that incorporates representation from BCPRA admi￾nistrative bodies involved in health services delivery
relevant to GN, one component of which is the GN
Registry within PROMIS. This integration of data cap￾ture within the larger framework of GN health adminis￾tration will allow for robust evaluation of health policy
or clinical care programs developed by the BC GN
Network. Indeed, this model has proven effective at
improving the outcomes of all-cause CKD patients in
BC. PROMIS was designed as a CKD administrative
database to inform the renal-specific health care delivery
of the BCPRA. It has been used to show that CKD
patients managed in multi-disciplinary care clinics have
better metabolic parameters and improved survival on
dialysis compared to those managed by nephrologists
[14]. Further, comprehensive data obtained from PRO￾MIS has been used to identify substantial cost savings by
managing CKD patients in a combined specialist clinic,
describe provincial variability in testing for hepatitis B
immune status in renal patients, and identify rare but
severe complications from dialyzer membranes [15-17].
The model of integrating data collection into health care
delivery has already proven effective in BC in all-cause
CKD, and it is anticipated that similar results will be
seen in patients with glomerular disease.
Combining the BC GN Registry with the health ser￾vices delivery and administrative activities of the BCPRA
has the additional benefit of improving the scope and
reducing the cost of data capture for a rare disease such
as GN. Existing GN registries have provided substantial
insight into the natural history of glomerular diseases
and have been invaluable in the advancement of GN

research [18-22]. However, most GN registries have been
research-based, limited in the geographic scope or type
of patient recruitment, and have relied on substantial
amounts of manual data collection [1]. By comparison,
the BC GN Registry is unique in that it is integrated into
the existing provincial CKD health delivery infrastruc￾ture and uses linkages to laboratory and administrative
databases to minimize laborious data entry, improving
data quality and quantity. This approach ensures the
long-term feasibility of the registry and allows complete
capture of relevant patient information throughout the
geographically diverse province of BC. In the study of
rare diseases such as GN, comprehensive data capture of
large numbers of patients over long periods of time is
viewed as essential.
Research in the field of GN has been substantially lim￾ited by the rarity of the disease and the poor availability
and substantial cost of detailed registries with long-term
follow-up that sample large source populations [1,23].
The BC GN Registry provides a feasible and sustainable
solution that will produce a rich dataset with clinically
relevant renal and mortality outcomes capable of sup￾porting research in glomerular disease. Data collection
leverages existing interfaces to automatically capture
laboratory results and ESRD status, which limits manual
data entry to only core elements. Further, the ability to
link administrative datasets provides the opportunity to
capture detailed outcome information as shown in
Figure 1 without the need for laborious prospective data
entry. The provincial scope of the BC GN Registry
allows patient recruitment from the entire population of
BC, thereby improving generalizability compared to
research-based GN registries that are often subject to
selection bias from focused enrollment of patients from
tertiary referral centres. The universal health care system
in Canada helps reduce some of the bias that results
from differential access to care. This approach to data
collection ensures that over time the BC GN Registry
will have a sufficient number of cases with detailed data
capture to support clinical outcomes and health services
research in GN. Furthermore, a coordinated provincial
strategy for identifying and following patients with GN
will facilitate recruitment into prospective clinical trials.
This unique approach can serve as a model for other
provinces in Canada, and as a nidus for Canadian GN
collaboration.
There are several limitations to the data collected in
the BC GN Registry. Firstly, in an attempt to improve
the feasibility of data collection and the geographic
distribution of patient enrolment, decisions were made
regarding the need for a limited set of core clinical vari￾ables. This can be viewed as a relative limitation, as add￾itional linkages with administrative datasets will be able
to supplement prospectively collected data. Specific
research questions can always be supplemented by review
of individual patient records as required. Further, the BC
GN Registry only enrolls patients with biopsy-proven
disease, and would not necessarily be generalizable to
patients with presumed GN that has not been confirmed
on kidney biopsy. However, standard nephrology practice
in Canada is to biopsy adult patients with clinically rele￾vant proteinuria, especially in the context of declining
renal function [24]. As such, patients with GN who do not
undergo a biopsy would be expected to have mild disease
with a favourable long-term prognosis. Further, the reli￾ance on kidney biopsy as the point of identification and
registration may complicate the ability to differentiate pri￾mary versus secondary disease in future research analyses.
This will be partially mitigated by complete capture of
laboratory data (such as autoimmune and viral serology)
that are used to identify secondary causes of GN. Finally,
there is a need for regular data validation methods so as
to ensure correct classification and data entry. Pragmatic
and robust processes of data validation are being devel￾oped and will be the subject of a future publication, once
a sufficient sample of patient records is available.
Conclusion
The BC GN Network is a unique approach to improving
the understanding and care of patients with GN, a rare
but important subset of patients with CKD. The BC GN
Registry constitutes the core of the network, and is a
comprehensive prospective database of patients with GN
in BC. The existence of the registry will support future
clinical outcomes and health services research in glomeru￾lar disease. The GN network utilizes a novel approach to
data collection in GN by being integrated into the existing
CKD health services infrastructure and by including auto￾matic capture of data through linkages to laboratories and
administrative databases. This reduces laborious manual
data entry, thereby broadening the geographic region from
which patients can be recruited. The BC GN Network is a
model of integrating knowledge acquisition, interpretation
and application in real time.
Availability and requirements
The BC GN Registry data is contained in PROMIS, which
is under regulation by governmental agencies in BC (the
BCPRA and the Provincial Health Services Authority).
Details about accessing PROMIS data for research
purposes can be found at the BCPRA website (www.bcre
nalagency.ca). Anyone interested in accessing PROMIS
data for non-commercial research purposes must com￾plete a data application request (which will be vetted by
the BCPRA) and secure ethics approval through the
University of British Columbia. Linkage of PROMIS data
to other administrative databases may require additional
approval from appropriate data stewards.
