Abstract
Introduction: The aim of this study was to evaluate the early diagnostic, risk stratification and prognostic value of
neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) and tissue inhibitor of matrix
metalloproteinases-1 (TIMP-1), compared with procalcitonin (PCT) and the Mortality in Emergency Department
Sepsis (MEDS) score in septic patients in the emergency department (ED).
Methods: In total, 480 consecutive adult patients were enrolled in this study. They fulfilled the systemic
inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria and were admitted to the ED of Beijing Chaoyang Hospital from
February 2013 to August 2013. A total of 40 healthy controls comprised the control group. The patients were
classified into four groups: SIRS, sepsis, severe sepsis, and septic shock. Serum NGAL, MMP-9, TIMP-1 and PCT were
measured, and MEDS score was calculated at enrollment. The prognostic values of NGAL, MMP-9 and TIMP-1 were
compared with PCT and MEDS score. A 28-day follow-up was performed for all patients.
Results: The median levels of serum NGAL and TIMP-1 increased with sepsis severity. The areas under the receiver
operating characteristic (AUC) curves of NGAL or TIMP-1 were greater than those of PCT and MEDS score in
diagnosing and predicting 28-day mortality, and the AUC of a combination of NGAL and MEDS score or TIMP-1 and
MEDS score was more significant. Serum NGAL, MMP-9 and TIMP-1 levels were significantly higher in non-survivors
than survivors at 28 days’ follow-up. In addition, the level of NGAL was much higher in septic patients with acute
kidney injury (AKI) than those without AKI. NGAL, TIMP-1, MMP-9 and MEDS score were found to be independent
predictors of 28-day mortality in septic patients. The levels of serum NGAL and TIMP-1 were positively correlated
with PCT and MEDS score in every septic group.
Conclusions: NGAL and TIMP-1 are valuable for the risk stratification, early diagnosis and prognostication of sepsis
in the ED. NGAL is also a valuable biomarker for prognosis of septic patients with AKI in the ED.

Introduction
Sepsis is the systemic inflammatory response to infection,
and has a high mortality rate despite the use of modern
antibiotics and resuscitation therapies [1], particularly in
septic patients with associated acute kidney injury (AKI).
Early diagnosis, appropriate classification and intervention
in the initial periods of sepsis play a crucial role in
decreasing mortality, and they are implemented in the
emergency department (ED) [2]. Although clinical
scoring systems are useful tools to evaluate the severity
and prognosis of sepsis, most of them are created for ICU
patients and may not be applicable to the ED. Finding
biomarkers and combining them with the clinical
scoring systems for early diagnosis, risk stratification, and
evaluation of prognosis of sepsis has great significance.
Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) is
an endogenous bacteriostatic protein that is expressed
and secreted by neutrophils, macrophages, hepatocytes,
and renal tubular cells in various pathologic states [3,4].
NGAL represents the activities of the neutrophils and
comprises a critical component of innate immunity
to bacterial infection [5]. Matrix metalloproteinase-9
(MMP-9) and its inhibitor, tissue inhibitor of matrix
metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1), are promising novel bio￾markers to predict the severity and outcome of sepsis [6,7],
and are involved in the pathogenesis of sepsis and septic
shock [8]. NGAL seems to positively modulate the
activity of MMP-9 [9]. It protects MMP-9 from proteolytic
degradation and enhances its enzymatic activities by
binding and forming the MMP-9/NGAL complex.
Some clinical studies have confirmed that serum NGAL,
MMP-9 and TIMP-1 levels are increased in septic patients
[10,11]. However, most of the previous studies, which had
small sample sizes, included ICU admission patients,
and the relationship of these biomarkers could not be
expounded. In this study, we questioned whether serum
NGAL, MMP-9 and TIMP-1 concentrations are different
according to the severity of sepsis, and compared their
clinical value in early diagnosis, risk stratification and
prognostic evaluation of sepsis with procalcitonin
(PCT) and the mortality in emergency department sepsis
(MEDS) score.
Materials and methods
Patients and grouping
A single-center observational study was conducted in the
ED of Beijing Chaoyang Hospital, an urban university
tertiary hospital with approximately 250,000 ED admissions
per year. Between February 2013 and August 2013, con￾secutive patients who fulfilled the systemic inflammatory
response syndrome (SIRS) criteria defined by the American
College of Chest Physicians/Society of Critical Care
Medicine (ACCP/SCCM) were enrolled [12]. Forty healthy
individuals comprised the age-matched control group from
volunteers in the Physical Examination Center of Beijing
Chao-yang Hospital. Patients were classified at the time of
enrollment as having SIRS, sepsis, severe sepsis, or septic
shock, according to ACCP/SCCM criteria [12]. Antibiotics
and fluid resuscitation were the mainstays of therapy
for patients with severe sepsis. Other interventions,
including vasoactive agents and mechanical ventilation,
were administered if necessary.
The exclusion criteria were as follows: patients
aged <18 years, and patients (or their relatives) who
declined to participate. Four hundred and forty
patients were enrolled and followed up for 28 days or
until death. This study was approved by the Beijing
Chao-yang Hospital Ethics Committee. Written informed
consent was obtained from all participants (or their
relatives) [13].
Measurement methods
Subject data, name, age, sex, past medical history and
vital signs were recorded immediately at enrollment.
Some correlative laboratory examinations were carried
out and recorded within 24 hours. Venous blood samples
were obtained at the time of ED admission, collected in
tubes containing heparin or ethylenediamine tetraacetate,
separated by centrifugation at 3,000 rpm for 5 minutes,
and stored at –80°C until assayed. The levels of NGAL,
MMP-9 and TIMP-1 were determined by enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay using commercially available kits
(R&D Systems Inc., Minneapolis, MN, USA). The NGAL,
MMP-9 and TIMP-1 reference ranges were 100 to
300 ng/mL, 20 to 200 ng/mL, and 150 to 500 ng/mL,
respectively. PCT was measured using a bioMerieux
Mini VIDAS® immunoassay analyzer (Block Scientific,
Bohemia, NY, USA) using serum samples. And the upper
and lower detection limits of PCT were 200 ng/mL and
0.05 ng/mL. The MEDS score was calculated when
the patients were admitted to the ED according to age,
past medical history, vital signs and laboratory results
[14]. Septic patients were classified into surviving and
non-surviving groups according to 28-day survival, and
those who died from all causes within the follow-up time
were considered non-survivors. In addition, the septic
patients were observed to see whether they developed
AKI, which was defined as an abrupt (within 48 h)
decrease in kidney function, with an absolute increase
in serum creatinine ≥0.3 mg/dL or a percentage increase
in serum creatinine ≥50% (1.5-fold from baseline),
according to the Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN)
criteria [15].
Statistical analysis
All data were analyzed using SPSS 16.0 software (SPSS Inc.,
Chicago, IL, USA). Non-normally distributed data,
including serum NGAL, MMP-9 and TIMP-1 levels,
Wang et al. Critical Care 2014, 18:634 Page 2 of 11
http://ccforum.com/content/18/6/634

serum PCT levels, and MEDS score, were expressed as
the median (25th to 75th percentile). Kruskal-Wallis
one-way analysis of variance was applied for multi-group
comparisons, and two-group comparisons were performed
using the Mann-Whitney U-test. To compare the predic￾tion of NGAL, MMP-9, TIMP-1, PCT, and MEDS score for
28-day mortality, receiver operating characteristic (ROC)
curves were constructed and the area under the ROC curve
(AUC) was determined. On the basis of optimal thresholds
determined according to ROC curve analysis, prognostic
parameters, including sensitivity, specificity, positive
predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value
(NPV), were also calculated. In addition, the Z-test
formula was applied for comparisons of AUCs. Binary
logistic regression analysis was applied to determine
the independent predictors of 28-day mortality. All
statistical tests were two-tailed, and P <0.05 was considered
statistically significant. Finally, Spearman correlation
analysis was applied to determine the correlation between
NGAL, MMP-9, TIMP-1 and MEDS score.
Results
Patient demographics
There were no significant differences in age and sex
among the five groups of enrolled subjects (SIRS, sepsis,
severe sepsis, septic shock, and control groups) (Table 1).
The baseline characteristics, diseases and associated
infections in the enrolled subjects are also presented
in Table 1. The 28-day mortality was 31.1% in SIRS and
septic patients. The 28-day mortality increased with
clinical severity of sepsis, and the differences between the
two groups were significant (P <0.01).
Comparison of median levels of NGAL, MMP-9, TIMP-1
and MMP-9/TIMP-1 ratio, and MEDS score
The median NGAL, MMP-9, TIMP-1 and MMP-9/
TIMP-1 ratio levels, the PCT levels, and MEDS scores
in each group are shown in Table 1 and NGAL, MMP-9,
TIMP-1 levels, in each group are also shown in Figures 1,
2 and 3. Serum NGAL, TIMP-1, PCT and MEDS score
at ED admission were significantly different among the

NGAL, MMP-9 and TIMP-1 levels were significantly
higher in patients with SIRS, sepsis, severe sepsis and
septic shock (P <0.01). In addition, NGAL, MMP-9,
TIMP-1 levels and MEDS score were significantly higher in
sepsis, severe sepsis and septic shock than in SIRS
(P <0.01). NGAL, TIMP-1, PCT levels and MEDS
score were markedly higher in severe sepsis and septic
shock than in sepsis (P <0.01), and were clearly
higher in septic shock than in severe sepsis (P <0.01).
However, the MMP-9 and MMP-9/TIMP-1 ratio was
not significantly higher in severe sepsis and septic
shock than in sepsis, or in septic shock than in severe
sepsis.
NGAL, MMP-9 and TIMP-1 levels in survivors and
non-survivors
NGAL, MMP-9 and TIMP-1 levels were higher in non￾survivors than in survivors (all P <0.01). As shown in
Figure 4, PCT was also higher in non-survivors than
survivors (P <0.01).

Value of NGAL, MMP-9, TIMP-1 and MEDS score for
predicting 28-day mortality
The AUC of NGAL for predicting 28-day mortality in
septic patients was 0.833, and of TIMP-1 was 0.845,
higher than that of PCT (0.768; P <0.05) or MEDS score
(0.763; P <0.05). The AUC of MMP-9 for predicting
28-day mortality in septic patients was 0.700, lower
than that for the PCT and MEDS score.
The AUC of NGAL and TIMP-1 in combination
with the MEDS score was 0.858 and 0.882, respect￾ively, which was statistically significant compared
with PCT alone (0.768; all P <0.05) or the combin￾ation of PCT and MEDS score (0.782; all P <0.05).
The ROC curves of these biomarkers for predicting
28-day mortality among the five groups are shown in

Using a NGAL cutoff value of 236.62 ng/mL for predict￾ing 28-day mortality in septic patients, the sensitivity was
71.8%, specificity was 77.1%, the PPV was 79.5%, and NPV
was 74.5%. Using a TIMP-1 cutoff value of 268.27 ng/mL
for predicting 28-day mortality in septic patients, the
sensitivity was 71.1%, specificity was 88.4%, the PPV was
72.1%, and the NPV was 87.9%. The detailed results are
presented in Tables 2 and 3.
NGAL, MMP-9, TIMP-1, MEDS score as independent
predictors of 28-day mortality
Age, sex, NGAL, MMP-9, TIMP-1, PCT and the MEDS
score were included in a multivariate logistic regression
model to determine the independent predictors of 28-day
mortality. Using binary logistic regression analysis, NGAL
(B = 0.047, odds ratio (OR) = 1.048, P = 0.010), MEDS score
(B = 0.124, OR = 1.132, P <0.001), TIMP-1 (B = 0.039,
OR = 1.040, P <0.001) and MMP-9 (B = 0.020, OR = 1.020,
P = 0.010) were found to be independent predictors of
28-day mortality in septic patients, but PCT (B = 0.109,
OR = 0.894, P = 0.010), age and gender were not (Table 4).
Correlation of serum NGAL levels with serum MMP-9,
TIMP-1 and PCT levels
Spearman correlation analysis of NGAL with neutrophils,
MMP-9, TIMP-1 and PCT showed correlation coefficients
of 0.602, 0.302, 0.583, and 0.526, respectively (all P <0.001).
The correlation coefficient between MMP-9 and TIMP-1
was 0.391, which suggested positive correlation.
NGAL levels in AKI and non-AKI septic patients
The NGAL level was higher in AKI than in non-AKI
septic patients (P <0.01). As shown in Figure 6, the
AUC of NGAL for predicting AKI in septic patients
was 0.897, higher than that of PCT (0.645; P <0.01)
and TIMP-1 (0.647; P <0.01) (Figure 7 and Table 2).
Discussion
During recent decades, the mortality of sepsis has remained
unacceptably high. Early diagnosis and exact risk stratifica￾tion, which are keys to initiating timely treatments, are
significant predictors [1]. Consequently, there is a demand
for useful severity scoring systems and biomarkers to

improve the outcomes in early diagnosis and risk
assessment. Although it has disadvantages compared
with the other severity scoring systems, the MEDS
score is derived from septic patients in the ED and is
more suitable for predicting mortality in this cohort
[16,17]. In the present study we chose MEDS score as a
comparative variable to NGAL and TIMP-1. Meanwhile,
in diagnosis, differential diagnosis, risk stratification and
prognosis biomarkers play important roles in septic
patients. The most widely used clinical biomarker is PCT,
and while confirmed to be superior to other biomarkers in
some studies, its prognostic value is controversial [18,19].
Consistent with previous studies [20,21], our study
indicates the NGAL is elevated in the peripheral blood of
sepsis patients. Human NGAL was originally identified as
a novel protein isolated from secondary granules of
human neutrophils and was subsequently demonstrated
to be a 25-kDa protein covalently bound to neutrophil
gelatinase [3,22]. NGAL protein is mainly synthesized
at the early-myelocyte stage of granulopoiesis during
formation of secondary granules, and NGAL mRNA
is normally expressed in many adult human tissues,
such as bone marrow, uterus, prostate, salivary gland,
stomach, colon, trachea, lung, liver and kidney [23].
In addition, NGAL comprises a critical component of
innate immunity to bacterial infection. Siderophores
are synthesized by bacteria to scavenge iron from
their surroundings, and use specific transporters to
recover the siderophore-iron complex, ensuring their
iron supply. The siderophore-chelating property of NGAL
therefore renders it a bacteriostatic agent [24]. NGAL
expression has been studied in several normal tissues
where it functions to modulate oxidative stress and to
provide protection against bacterial infection, and it has
been proved in animal experiments [25]. Based on these
two mechanisms, it is not surprising that circulating
NGAL is increased in sepsis because of its structure and
function, and that NGAL level increased according to the
clinical severity of sepsis in our study.
MMP-9 is one of the family of MMPs, and is induced
by many inflammatory factors, including interleukin
(IL)-1b, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor-α. It is stored in
the tertiary granules of polymorphonuclear leukocytes,
which are key effectors in acute inflammatory diseases
such as sepsis [26]. MMPs are not expressed during normal
conditions but are expressed and activated increasingly

during inflammation, and their main function has
been considered to be the degradation and removal of
extracellular matrix molecules from the tissue [27]. It is
reported that MMP-9 and gelatinase activity increased
significantly after sepsis, and TIMP-1, an MMP-9 inhibi￾tor, blocked these activities, as well as the ensuing septic
shock. Furthermore, with the development of sepsis, these
results are consistent with MMP-9-induced caspase-3
activation in response to infection, which increases TIMP-1
level and thereby inhibits MMP-9, in turn decreasing
transforming growth factor-β1 and caspase-3 signaling
pathways and improving survival in septic rats [28].
The integrity of tissue architecture is closely dependent on
the delicate balance between the activation of MMPs and
their inhibition by TIMPs. Any alteration in this balance is
linked to tissue damage. Elevated levels of MMP-9 and
TIMP-1 were reported in septic patients, and higher
TIMP-1 levels at the beginning of severe sepsis were
predictive of death [29].
In humans, NGAL was originally identified as a 25-kDa
protein covalently linked to MMP-9 in human neutrophils,
which normally provide the main cellular source of circu￾lating NGAL. By forming the MMP-9/NGAL complex,
NGAL protects MMP-9 from proteolytic degradation,
increasing the enzymatic activity of MMP-9 and subse￾quently enhancing tumoral invasiveness and diffusion [30].
In the present study, MMP-9 was higher with increased
severity of sepsis in the groups with SIRS, sepsis and
severe sepsis (P <0.01), but the level decreased according
to severity of septic shock. MMP-9 elevation has become
a useful marker of the severity of sepsis [10], but a multi￾center study by Lorente et al. [31] found a non-significant
increase in MMP-9. MMP/TIMP ratios may mirror the
balance between the proteolytic activity of MMPs and
their tissue inhibitors, and the importance of reduced
MMP-9/TIMP-1 ratio as a predictive biomarker of
severity in septic patients [31]. In our study, TIMP-1 levels
significantly increased on admission according to the

severity of sepsis. Therefore, the variation in MMP-9
was not only related to the change in TIMP-1, which
is the specific inhibitor of MMP-9, but also to the variation
of NGAL.
The ED often serves as the first location for initial
evaluation and risk stratification, which is essential to
the timely management of septic patients. Our research
also focuses on the early prognostic evaluation of septic
patients. Our study suggests that the prognostic value of
NGAL, MMP-9 or TIMP-1 is superior to PCT and MEDS
score, and that NGAL, TIMP-1, MMP-9 or MEDS score,
but not PCT, are robust independent predictors of 28-day
death in patients with sepsis. We found that the difference in
NGAL, TIMP-1 and MMP-9 levels between non-survivors
and survivors was significant. From the ROC analysis of a
large sample of septic patients at ED admission, we found
that NGAL and TIMP-1 were superior to PCT and showed
higher sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV in the early
diagnosis of 28-day mortality. Taken together, these results
suggest that NGAL and TIMP-1 may be useful to identify
septic patients at risk of short-term mortality in the ED.
The clinical practice scoring systems are useful tools
to evaluate the severity and prognosis of septic patients.
While severity scoring systems and biomarkers have
their own advantages and disadvantages in the prognosis
of sepsis, both can be considered objective and accurate.
Researchers have attempted to combine severity scoring
systems with biomarkers to improve the accuracy of risk
stratification and prognosis. In our study, the prognostic
ability of the combination of NGAL or TIMP-1 with
MEDS score was superior to either biomarker or MEDS
score alone, and also superior to the combination of
PCT with MEDS score. The combination of severity
scoring systems and biomarkers is more effective in risk
stratification and prognosis, as indicated in the present
study. These results demonstrate that NGAL and TIMP-1
enhanced the ability of the MEDS score in the risk
stratification and prognosis evaluation.
AKI in ICUs is frequently complicated with sepsis, and
AKI and sepsis increase mortality synergistically. NGAL is
an emerging biomarker for AKI. Its performance in early
detection of renal damage has been valuable in several

metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) and procalcitonin (PCT) for diagnosis of acute kidney injury (AKI) in sepsis.

AKI cohorts [21,32,33]. In the present study, 89 (24.7%)
septic patients developed AKI, according to the AKIN
criteria. NGAL was significantly higher in septic AKI
patients than in the other AKI patients and non-AKI
patients (P <0.01). From the AUC of NGAL for septic
AKI, we discovered that the prognostic ability of NGAL
was superior to other biomarkers. The present study
proved that NGAL was a biomarker for AKI, particularly
in septic patients.
Limitations
Some limitations merit consideration in this study. It
was a single-center study and did not compare other
severity score systems and biomarkers. Sepsis was
established according to criteria for sepsis as defined
by ACCP/SCCM as it was difficult to obtain pathogen
samples. The dynamic changes of biomarkers were not
observed. We did not have information on patient
treatment preferences that could introduce confounding
and bias.
Conclusions
NGAL, MMP-9 and TIMP-1 are independent predictors
of 28-day mortality in septic patients in the ED, and are
promising biomarkers in early diagnosis, risk stratification
and evaluation of prognosis in septic patients. NGAL may
be a promising biomarker not only in sepsis but also in
diagnosis of sepsis with AKI.
