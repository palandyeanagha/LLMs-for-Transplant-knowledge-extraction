Summary
Eosinophilic infiltration of the myocardium is occasionally observed as an incidental histological finding in en￾domyocardial biopsy specimens before heart transplantation (HTx) as well as in explanted heart obtained at the time of 
HTx. However, the indications for HTx in these patients have not yet been fully established. We investigated the pre￾HTx characteristics of the recipients with myocardial eosinophilic infiltration in the explanted heart and diagnosed as hy￾persensitivity myocarditis (HSM) (21 among 761 recipients, 2.8%). Dobutamine, a common cause of HSM, was admin￾istered to 12 patients (57%). Ten patients (47.6%) were on milrinone and 4 (19.0%) were on ventricular assist devices. 
Post-transplant survival of HSM patients was comparable to that of patients transplanted for active myocarditis or other 
cause of heart failure. In conclusion, myocardial eosinophilic infiltration is associated with multiple medications in pa￾tients with advanced heart failure; however, it does not affect the post-transplant prognosis. (Int Heart J 2013; 54: 146-

The benefits of heart transplantation (HTx) for patients 
with myocarditis have been challenged because of 
possible recurrence and poor prognosis after HTx. 
Eosinophilic myocarditis, such as Chagas disease and Churg￾Straus syndrome, was reported to have an influence on the 
prognosis after HTx,1, 2) whereas eosinophilic infiltration of the 
myocardium is occasionally observed as an incidental histo￾logic finding in endomyocardial biopsy specimens before HTx 
as well as in explanted heart obtained at the time HTx. This is 
known as hypersensitivity myocarditis (HSM), which is a car￾diac manifestation of a delayed-type allergic reaction typically 
caused by drugs.3, 4) The characteristics of patients with ad￾vanced heart failure and eosinophilic infiltration of the myo￾cardium but a lack of any clinical manifestation of Churg￾Straus syndrome or Chagas disease who were considered to 
have HSM, have yet to be elucidated in the recent era of heart 
failure medical therapy. Furthermore, the indication for HTx in 
patients coincidentally found to have HSM has not yet been 
fully discussed. Therefore, we investigated the incidence of 
HSM and its pre-transplant clinical characteristics using the 
database of a large transplant center.
Methods
A total of 761 consecutive patients undergoing de novo
HTx at Columbia University Medical Center were retrospec￾tively reviewed. The pretransplant medication of HSM patients 
was examined. A diagnosis of HSM was made based on the 
histological evidence of the myocardium, that is mixed eosi￾nophil-rich infiltrate with lymphocytes, macrophages, and 
plasma cells, but little myocyte necrosis as previously de￾scribed.3) The post-transplant survival rates of patients with 
HSM, those with other types of active myocarditis including 
giant cell myocarditis and lymphocytic myocarditis diagnosed 
by histological evaluation of the explanted heart (n = 31), and 
those with other causes of heart failure (n = 709) were com￾pared using the Kaplan-Meier method with a log-rank test. All 
statistical analyses were performed using an SPSS software 
program (version 13.0J for Windows, SPSS Inc., Tokyo).
Results
HSM was diagnosed in 21 patients (2.7%) by histological 
evaluation of the explanted heart. None of them were suspect￾From the Departments of 1

ed of having HSM before HTx or diagnosed by endomyocar￾dial biopsy performed as a part of an HTx candidacy evalua￾tion. All patients with HSM had varying degrees of mixed 
inflammatory infiltrates with eosinophils, lymphocytes, macro￾phages, and plasma cells in the explanted hearts, but none of 
the patients exhibited myocardial necrosis (Figure 1). All ex￾cept one patient with HSM were treated with inotropes before 
HTx; 12 patients (57%) were on dobutamine and 10 (48%) re￾ceived milrinone (Table). When we performed a subanalysis of 
patients supported by dobutamine infusion but without LVAD 
support before HTx who were in United Network for Organ 
Sharing (UNOS) status 1A or 1B at the time of HTx (n = 372), 
patients with HSM were more likely to be treated with dob￾utamine before HTx compared to those with another cause of 
heart failure [HSM versus Active myocarditis versus Others = 
12 (57.1%) versus 6 (37.5%) versus 53 (14.9%), P = 0.00001; 
HSM versus Others, P = 0.00002; HSM versus Active myo￾carditis, P = 0.236]. Dobutamine was administered before HTx 
in 71 patients (19.1%) in this cohort, and 12 patients (16.9%) 
were diagnosed as HSM by histological examination of the ex￾planted heart at the time of HTx. β-Blockers were administered 
to 7 patients (33%) and ACE inhibitors to 11 patients (52%). 
Antibiotics were administered to 12 patients, including 8 pa￾tients on vancomycin (n = 8, 38.1%). Drugs that were reported 
to be associated with HSM such as heparin (n = 9), phenytoin 
(n = 1), and sulfonylurea (n = 1) were also used.5) Four patients 
(19.0%) were supported by left ventricular assist devices 
(LVAD) at the time of HTx. Seven (33%) had a past history of 
drug allergy. Peripheral blood eosinophilia before HTx was 
observed in 19 patients (90%). Peak eosinophil count averaged 
900/mm3
 with a range of 100 to 4000 (normal values less than 
400/mm3
). The post-transplant survival rates of patients with 
HSM, with active myocarditis, and with another cause of heart 
failure were not significantly different (Figure 2).
Discussion
Eosinophilic infiltration to the myocardium, known as 
HSM, is a hypersensitivity response caused by a variety of 
drugs including inotropes, vasodilators, diuretics, and antibiot￾ics.3, 4) The incidence was reported to be 0.5% in autopsy series 
and up to 23% in explanted heart for HTx.6, 7) Patients with ad￾vanced cardiac failure are generally treated with multiple med￾ications, which is related to the increased incidence of HSM in 
HTx candidates. HSM may cause the symptoms of heart fail￾ure,8-10) but most patients do not have obvious clinical features 
of HSM and they are frequently diagnosed as an incidental

finding at the time of HTx. HSM is usually resolved by drug 
withdrawal and corticosteroid therapy; however, it is difficult 
to wean heart failure patients from their medication even if 
HSM is diagnosed. Therefore, although the indication for HTx 
in patients with active myocarditis is still controversial, it may 
be difficult to exclude patients with HSM from the HTx wait￾ing list. Little has been reported on the characteristics of pa￾tients with HSM in the era of modern medical therapy for heart 
failure, including LVAD usage and β-blocker administration as 
a standard medication.
In the present study, we found the incidence of HSM in a 
series of over 700 consecutive HTx recipients was about 3%, 
which was lower than the incidence reported in previous stud￾ies.11, 12) We speculate that LVAD therapy has evolved into a 
standard therapy for patients waiting for HTx and it enables a 
majority of LVAD recipients to be weaned from continuous 
dobutamine infusion resulting in a low incidence of HSM 
among the total HTx recipient population, because dobutamine 
is a drug well-known to be associated with HSM.7, 11) Indeed, 
although the incidence of HSM itself was lower than in previ￾ous studies, nearly 60% of the patients with HSM in our cohort 
were on dobutamine. We also found that almost half of the pa￾tients received milrinone, specific phosphodiesterase type in￾hibitors, and one third of the patients were on β-blockers. Frus￾tati, et al reported a case with HSM induced by metoprolol,13)
but the frequency of HSM caused by β-blockers has not yet 
been clarified. Because of multiple drug therapy, we could not 
determine which drug was involved in the development of 
HSM. However, we observed different trends in pharmaco￾therapy for heart failure from previous studies, which are 
worthwhile reporting in the era of recent heart failure therapy. 
We also observed the prognosis of patients with HSM was 
equivalent to those with myocarditis or other cause of heart 
failure as a primary reason for HTx.
The present study is a retrospective, single center analysis 
based on a small number of patients with HSM, and indeed, 
none of the patients were diagnosed as HSM during the trans￾plant evaluation process. In addition, it may be difficult to dis￾tinguish HSM from myocarditis associated with hypereosi￾nophilic syndrome, especially after treatment with steroids. 
However, we still believe that our investigation was conducted 
in a large cohort of heart-transplant recipients, since we are 
one of the largest transplant centers in the United States. Based 
on our study findings, we believe that patients with HSM 
would not necessarily need to be excluded from the waiting list 
for HTx because they can be expected to have a favorable life 
prognosis that is equal to other patients without HSM. Further 
studies would be required to evaluate the frequency of eosi￾nophilic infiltration to the myocardium, which occurs during 
their heart failure treatment, and its effect on prognosis. In ad￾dition, the post-transplant prognoses of patients who are sus￾pected to have eosinophilic infiltration to the myocardium 
should be investigated in large multi-institutional studies.
