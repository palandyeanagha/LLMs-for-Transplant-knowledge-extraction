Introduction
Amyloidosis is a rare systemic disorder characterized by
misfolding of aberrant precursor proteins causing formation
of unstable auto aggregates leading to amyloid fibril forma￾tion in a predominant β-pleated sheet structure.1 These fibrils
are deposited in different organs, progressively affecting the
organ’s architecture and function.2 The unstable protein may
be hereditary or acquired. The most common organs
involved include the heart, kidneys, liver, gastrointestinal
tract, autonomic and peripheral nervous system. Systemic
light chain (AL) amyloidosis is the most common type: in
which the amyloidogenic protein is a monoclonal light chain
secreted by an underlying clonal plasma cell (or rarely B lym￾phoid) dyscrasia.2
Amyloidosis caused by deposition of misfolded
transthyretin (TTR) is the next most common, either heredi￾tary (due to amyloidogenic TTR mutations) or a disease of
aging due to wild-type TTR deposition (senile systemic amy￾loidosis). Other hereditary amyloidoses are due to amyloido￾genic mutations in fibrinogen, Apolipoprotein A1 and A2,
lysozyme and gelsolin genes. AA amyloidosis occurs due to
deposition of serum amyloid A protein (an acute phase pro￾tein) in a spectrum of disorders causing prolonged inflamma￾tion, and treatment focuses upon reducing that inflammatory
drive. Table 1 illustrates the common types of systemic amy￾loidosis.3 Localized AL amyloidosis is characterized by amy￾loid deposits at a single site (commonly in bladder, skin, lar￾ynx, lung) due to local production of light chains and no evi￾dence of systemic involvement. It has excellent prognosis
with generally no need for systemic therapy.4 This article
focuses upon recent advances in treatment of systemic AL
amyloidosis.
Clinical presentation and diagnosis
The presenting symptoms of AL amyloidosis have a wide
spectrum: dyspnea, lethargy, weight loss, bleeding tendency,
swelling of lower limbs, frothy urine, orthostatic hypotension
or peripheral neuropathy. Macroglossia and peri-orbital bruis￾ing are almost pathognomonic, occurring only in a third of all
cases (Figure 1). The diagnosis of AL amyloidosis is often
delayed as presenting features are subtle or mimic other more
common conditions.
Advanced organ dysfunction has often ensued prior to a
clinical diagnosis of amyloidosis although monoclonal gam￾mopathy (MGUS)5 or myeloma usually pre-dates a diagnosis
of amyloidosis. Fifteen percent of patients with myeloma
have symptomatic AL amyloidosis and up to 30% may have
‘incidental’ deposits, which may become clinically significant
with improving long-term outcomes in myeloma.6 Patients
with MGUS and an abnormally elevated free light chain
(FLC) should be additionally monitored at each visit by meas￾urement of serum brain natriuretic peptide (BNP or its N-ter￾minal fragment, NT-proBNP) and urine for albuminuria;
abnormal presence of either may herald development of
amyloidosis1 before advanced, symptomatic organ damage,
thus significantly reducing the early deaths which are still
observed.

Light chain amyloidosis is the most common type of amyloidosis as a consequence of protein misfolding of aggre￾gates composed of amyloid fibrils. The clinical features are dependent on the organs involved, typically cardiac, renal,
hepatic, peripheral and autonomic neuropathy and soft tissue. A tissue biopsy or fat aspirate is needed to confirm the
presence/type of amyloid and prognostic tools are important in a risk stratified approach to treatment. Autologous
stem cell transplant eligibility should be assessed at baseline, weighing the reversible or non-reversible contraindica￾tions, toxicity of treatment and chemotherapy alternatives available. Chemotherapy options include melphalan,
thalidomide, bortezomib, lenalidomide, bendamustine in combination with dexamethasone. Many studies have
explored these treatment modalities, with ongoing debate about the optimal first line and sequential treatment there￾after. Attaining a very good partial response or better is the treatment goal coupled with early assessment central to
optimizing treatment. One major challenge remains increasing the awareness of this disease, frequently diagnosed
late as the presenting symptoms mimic many other medical conditions. This review focuses on the treatments for
light chain amyloidosis, how these treatments have evolved over the years, improved patient risk stratification, tox￾icities encountered and future directions.

rectum or abdominal fat aspirate (the latter being an easy
bedside procedure available for all patients including those
with hemostatic impairment).7 Fibril typing is critical in
deciding appropriate therapy and performed by immuno￾histochemistry (widely available but specific only in 75-
80% of cases of AL),8 immunoelectron microscopy (highly
specific but limited availability),9 or lately, mass spectrom￾etry of amyloid deposits obtained by laser capture (rapidly
becoming an invaluable adjunct)10 (Figure 2). Detecting the
underlying clone requires serum and urine electrophoresis
and immunofixation, serum free light chain analysis, bone
marrow examination and imaging for presence of myelo￾ma-related bone disease.

Figure 1. Pathogenesis and presenta￾tion of AL amyloidosis. Direct deposi￾tion of amyloid fibrils lead to the typi￾cal clinical features depicted: peri￾orbital bruising; macroglossia with
indentation of teeth marks of the
tongue; nail dystrophy; lower limb
edema with nephrotic syndrome; soft
tissue infiltration of hands bilaterally;
ECG showing small QRS complexes
and late gadolinium enhancement of
cardiac MRI. The pre-fibrillar light
chain aggregates (and possibly the
misfolded light chains) can have
direct tissue toxicity. Cardiac toxicity
of light chains appears to be a signifi￾cant contributor to myocardial dys￾function seen in AL amyloidosis. This
may also be the reason for rapid
improvement in NT-proBNP which par￾allels a hematologic response to ther￾apy often without any evidence of

important for prognosis and selection of therapy. Formal
testing for autonomic and peripheral neuropathy may be
needed in selected cases. 123I labeled serum amyloid P com￾ponent (SAP) scintigraphy (if available), is useful for diag￾nosis, quantification and especially valuable in serial mon￾itoring of amyloid deposits (Figure 3).11 Cardiac magnetic
resonance imaging (CMR) is more sensitive and specific
than echocardiography for diagnosis of cardiac amyloido￾sis, showing a characteristic subendocardial late gadolini￾um enhancement. A cardiac biopsy may be needed in a
select cohort of patients with isolated cardiac amyloidosis
and MGUS to differentiate AL amyloidosis from senile
systemic amyloidosis/ATTR amyloidosis due to V122I
mutation. Bone scintigraphy tracers, 99mTc-dicar￾boxypropane diphosphonate (99mTc-DPD) and 99mTc￾pyrophosphate (99mTc-PYP) are avidly taken up in cardiac
ATTR amyloid deposits but not in AL;12,13 this represents
an emerging non-invasive means of differentiating the
two conditions (Figure 3).
Risk stratification is an essential part of the diagnostic
workup and cardiac involvement determines the risk. The
Mayo Clinic group, using NT-proBNP and troponin T or I
(or more recently, using high sensitivity troponin14 and
more recently serum free light chains),15 defined stages in
AL amyloidosis depending on none, one or both being
greater than the threshold levels (median survival of 26.4,
10.5 and 3.5 months, respectively);16 even with newer
therapies, Mayo stage III disease still has a poor median
survival of seven months.16 NT-proBNP over 8500 ng/L
and systolic blood pressure below 100mmHg identify a
subgroup of stage III patients with a very high risk of early
death.16 Confounding factors, like renal failure, impact the
concentration of NT-proBNP, and measurement of BNP
may be preferred in this setting.17
Treatment of AL amyloidosis
Goals of therapy 
The aim of treatment in AL amyloidosis is eradicating
the fibril precursor protein by suppressing production of
free light chains as rapidly as possible by targeting the
underlying clonal plasma/B cell dyscrasia, whilst minimiz￾ing treatment-related mortality (TRM) and morbidity1
with supportive measures to preserve organ function.
Since patients with AL amyloidosis have a small clonal
burden18 and lack the high-risk cytogenetic features seen in
myeloma such as t(4:14) or del17p,19 shorter courses of
dose-adapted chemotherapy may be adequate to achieve
good hematologic responses.20
Response assessment has two components: hematolog￾ic and organ response, and the latter follows the former.21,22
dFLC measurement is a key marker to assess clonal dis￾ease response.22 Consensus criteria for hematologic
response assessment have recently been published (Table
3).23 A very good partial response (VGPR) (defined as dFLC
less than 40 mg/L) or better is associated with an OS of 80-
90% at three years,23 and is currently considered the min￾imum goal of therapy. 
In addition to standard measures of organ function, car￾diac biomarkers such as a reduction in NT-proBNP of 30%
and 300 ng/L from baseline following completion of ther￾apy usefully define a cardiac organ response.22 Lack of
such a decrease in NT-proBNP (in patients with heart
involvement) identifies a subgroup of patients achieving
less than CR who need a more profound hematologic
response. Factors such as worsening renal failure or treat￾ment with immunomodulatory drugs may lead to elevat￾ed cardiac biomarkers, confounding response assess￾ment.24

survival while anti-plasma cell therapy has time to take
effect, has an important impact upon survival and is a fun￾damental part of an integrated treatment. It requires the
co-ordinated expertise of several specialists familiar with
the disease. Patient education with daily weight, judicious
diuretic use, low salt diet, salt-poor albumin, cautious
angiotensin converting enzyme-inhibitors, use of thigh￾high stockings, midodrine for postural hypotension and
close multidisciplinary monitoring make lifesaving differ￾ences. Diarrhea, malabsorption and malnutrition may be
ameliorated by antimicrobial therapy for bacterial over￾growth, reduced gut motility with opioids (codeine phos￾phate and loperamide) with addition of octreotide in non￾responsive cases, prokinetic agents for gastroparesis, per￾cutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) feeding in those
with marked macroglossia impairing swallowing or
parental feeding in malabsorption. Amiodarone may have
a role in cardiac arrthymias, a common cause of death in
AL. Implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICD) are
increasing considered in patients with life-threatening
ventricular arrhythmias, but there is no definite evidence
of survival advantage at present.13
Autologous stem cell transplantation
High-dose melphalan and autologous peripheral blood
stem cell transplantation (ASCT) has been routinely used
as treatment for AL amyloidosis since the first reports in
the mid-1990s at Boston University25,26 (Table 4). Contrary
to the common experience with ASCT in multiple myelo￾ma, the toxicity of the procedure can be higher in AL, e.g.
a 15% incidence of major complications during stem cell
mobilization and collection, and mortality 2-10%50 in
patients with cardiac or multi-organ involvement. Over
the last decade, complications of ASCT in AL patients
have been well appreciated and addressed; appropriate
patient selection is the key to reduction in morbidity and
mortality. A small French randomized controlled trial
failed to show a difference in survival with ASCT over
conventional chemotherapy with oral melphalan and dex￾amethasone, with similar clonal hematologic response

rates; 67% versus 68%, respectively,30 but major limitations
included high TRM of 24% in the ASCT arm and small
sample size.51 Dose-adapted melphalan strategy, with
dose reduction to 100, 140 and 200 mg/m2 depending on
renal, cardiac parameters and age, increases a potentially
suitable patient population, with lower doses potentially
offering a reduced toxicity, but also reduced hematologic
responses.52
The largest transplant experience in AL amyloidosis
comes from the Mayo Clinic and Boston University. At
Boston University, assessment by a multi-disciplinary
team and use of risk stratification is employed to select
patients for ASCT. Eligibility criteria include histological
proof of amyloidosis, clonal plasma cell dyscrasia, age
over 18 years, performance status (PS) 0-2 (Southwest
Oncology Group or Zubrod), left ventricular ejection frac￾tion over 40%, oxygen saturations over 95% on air and
supine BP over 90 mmHg.1 Of 421 consecutive patients
treated with ASCT in this center from July 1994 to
December 2008, 55% received 200 mg/m2 high-dose mel￾phalan and 45% received modified dose melphalan (100-
140 mg/m2
). On an intention-to-treat basis, 34% achieved
a hematologic CR with an overall survival (OS) of 6.3
years. Of 340 evaluable patients, 43% achieved a com￾Treatment of AL amyloidosis

plete response (CR) and 78% achieved organ responses.
Comparison of those achieving a CR versus less than CR,
the median event-free survivals (EFS) and OS were 8.3 and
13.2 years in the former and 2 and 5.9 years in the latter
group, respectively. The overall TRM was 11.4%, with
5.6% in the latter five years, suggesting further refinement
to patient selection with added investigations and staging
criteria lowered the TRM.1 A landmark analysis at one
year in 140 patients with evaluable FLC results showed a
superior OS in those achieving a CR and very good partial
response (vGPR) versus those achieving a partial response
(PR) and no response (NR) (Figure 4A).53 The Mayo Clinic
reported a series of 422 patients receiving an ASCT from
March 1996 to December 2009. Transplant eligibility
included age under 70 years, PS 0-2, troponin T below 0.06
ng/mL, creatinine clearance over 30 mls/min (unless on
dialysis), New York Heart Association class I-II, and less
than 2 organ involvement. The focus of this analysis was
to examine the TRM before and after January 2006, with
TRM pre-2006 as 12% and 7% post-2006.56 Troponin T
over 0.06 ng/L and NT pro-BNP over 5000 pg/ml were
associated with a high TRM, whilst patients with both
markers below the thresholds had a TRM of 1%.57
Refining patient selection has allowed ASCT to be per￾formed safely, but eligibility of patients for ASCT has
decreased outside of centers with extensive transplant
experience. 
First major organ responses in AL were initially reported
after ASCT in 2001; 36% of patients achieved a renal
response at 12 months defined by the amyloidosis consen￾sus criteria1,50,52,53 proving that clonal responses in AL trans￾late into organ responses. The depth of hematologic

response strikingly correlated with renal responses.
Seventy-one percent of patients in CR had renal responses
compared to 11% with persistence of the plasma cell
dyscrasia. Over the last decade, improvements in quality
of life, hepatic and cardiac responses have been published.
Similar to renal responses, clinical responses in other organ
systems are more evident with deeper hematologic
responses. Organ responses can take up to 6-12 months or
longer to occur. Hematologic CR occurs in just under half
of all patients undergoing ASCT; strategies to improve
hematologic CR rates following ASCT are an important
focus. These include induction therapy prior to ASCT,
novel conditioning and consolidation therapy. A current
phase II trial to evaluate the role of induction treatment
prior to ASCT using Bortezomib/Dexamethasone (Dex) is
ongoing at Boston. Among the first 22 patients treated,
according to intention-to-treat analysis, hematologic
responses occurred in 79% (53% CR and 26% VGPR) of
patients (for evaluable patients 67% CR).58 Tandem cycles
of HDM have been shown to improve the proportion of
patients who ultimately achieve a hematologic CR, lead￾ing to an overall CR rate of 67%.59 A pilot study incorpo￾rating bortezomib with high-dose melphalan (HDM) has
shown promising results with high hematologic response
rates.58 Consolidation with thalidomide and dexametha￾sone is too toxic for routine use48 but bortezomib and dex￾amethasone as consolidation give high and durable
response rates including CR in 58% at 12 months,49 with
larger studies needed. 
Combination chemotherapy 
Alkylators and steroid-based regimens
Alkylating agents have formed the backbone of treat￾ment of AL for over 40 years with melphalan and
cyclophosphamide used in many current therapies. The
first randomized controlled trials proved the efficacy of
melphalan and prednisone60 in this disease, but novel
treatment options make this regimen less attractive given
the few and slow hematologic responses, poor survival of
18 months and rarer organ responses.60 Similarly, high￾dose single agent dexamethasone27 and vincristine, adri￾amycin and dexamethasone (VAD),61 although effective,
have been superseded due to toxicity and ease of admin￾istration, respectively, with recent regimens. 
Melphalan-dexamethasone (MDex) regimen, pioneered
by the Italian amyloidosis group, is well tolerated and

associated with good hematologic and organ response
rates of 67% and 33%, respectively, a third of patients
achieving a complete clonal response. The median PFS and
OS are 3.8 and 5.1 years, respectively;28 results confirmed
prospectively in subsequent studies (Figure 4B).30,54 This
regimen is usually well tolerated, with 10-15% experienc￾ing severe adverse events, mainly fluid retention and
cytopenias. Oral MDex is generally considered the stan￾dard of care for patients outside of clinical trials in a num￾ber of countries. However, the role of MDex in patients
with advanced cardiac disease is uncertain. These patients
have a median survival of 10.5 months62 and lower
response rates (11% CR and 33% PR in 61 patients with
cardiac AL); another study reported a median survival of
17 months and 28% mortality in the first three months in
patients treated with this regime.63 But high early mortali￾ty makes this group difficult to treat regardless of the reg￾imen. Intravenous intermediate dose melphalan (25
mg/m2
) had a 12% treatment-related mortality (TRM) in a
UK study with prolonged remission in the responders,64
but a recent prospective trial found this too toxic for rou￾tine use.65
Reduced toxicity of low-dose dexamethasone contain￾ing regimens in myeloma66 make these appealing in AL
amyloidosis. Melphalan and once weekly dexamethasone
was associated with lower responses67 than standard
MDex28 raising doubts as to this approach in AL where
rapid and deep responses are desirable. 
Bendamustine, an alkylator with a novel mechanism of
action, with prednisone is useful in relapsed/refractory
disease and achieved hematologic responses in 47%
(n=17) with a survival advantage in responders in a 3-
month landmark analysis (P=0.036). Three patients
achieved a VGPR or better in a heavily pre-treated patient
group with a 3-year OS of 65%.43 Grade 3 or greater
adverse events (seen in 33%), predominantly cytopenias,
were manageable. Bendamustine should be explored ear￾lier in the disease course.
Immunomodulatory agents
The efficacy of immunomodulatory (IMiD’s) agents in
plasma cell dyscrasias opened up another treatment
avenue for AL amyloidosis. Thalidomide, the first of these
agents, has a limited role in AL amyloidosis as monother￾apy due to unacceptable toxicity at higher doses and lim￾ited efficacy.68 The combination of thalidomide and dex￾amethasone (median thalidomide dose 300 mg) was effec￾tive and with clonal response rates of 48% (n=31), CR in
19%, and organ response in 26%. The median time to
response was 3.6 months69 but 60% experienced grade 3
or greater toxicity.
In the UK, a risk-adapted strategy based on the patient’s
clinical status allowed use of dose-adapted CTD
(cyclophosphamide/thalidomide/dexamethasone) with
good and rapid hematologic responses20 seen in 74%, with
CR and PR in 21% and 53%, respectively, and organ
responses in 33%. A recent analysis of a larger cohort of
202 patients confirmed these findings55 (Figure 4C).
Prospective analysis suggests that toxicity of CTDa still
remains high with 60% experiencing grade 3 or greater
toxicity (mainly fluid overload).70 This regime was the
standard of care in the UK but bortezomib-based regimes
are increasingly being used. 
Lenalidomide is a second generation IMiD with greater
anti-myeloma efficacy and favourable toxicity profile.
Two phase II studies reported that lenalidomide-dexam￾ethasone (Len/Dex) treatment showed good hematologic
responses in 67% (n=24), with CR and PR in 29% and
38%, respectively.36,37 Standard lenalidomide doses of 25
mg were poorly tolerated with much better tolerance with
15 mg daily. The most common side effects were fatigue
and myelosuppression accounting for 35%, and throm￾boembolism in 9% (n=3). Skin rashes were experienced in
43%.71 Lenalidomide combined with dexamethasone has
been used in a small cohort of patients refractory to alky￾lators, bortezomib and thalidomide, with a 41% response
rate and survival advantage in responders, indicating that
IMiDs can have a role in salvage treatment,72 with no
increased incidence of secondary malignancies.73
Complete response rates remain low with lenalidomide￾based regimes and a number of phase II studies have
focused on addition of an alkylator to improve the
response rates.24,38-41 Studies with additional cyclophos￾phamide or melphalan report overall hematologic
response rates of 55-60% and CRs of approximately 20%.
The toxicity of the combination is high with nearly two￾thirds of patients reporting grade 3 or greater toxicity
including hematologic in 46%; other side effects including
fatigue, edema and gastrointestinal problems. The
response rates in advanced stage patients are poor.24,41 The
exact role for a lenalidomide-alkylator combination and
advantages offered over Len/Dex remain to be clearly
defined.
Pomalidomide (a 3rd generation IMiD effective in myelo￾ma refractory to lenalidomide) with dexamethasone
achieved hematologic responses in 48% of patients with
refractory AL44 with organ responses in 5 patients. The
median OS and PFS were 28 months and 14 months,
respectively. A third of all patients withdrew from the
study due to adverse events. Pomalidomide shows prom￾ise as salvage therapy in relapsed refractory patients and
its combination with proteasome inhibitors needs to be
explored further. 
IMiDs, although effective and an important part of the
treatment in AL amyloidosis, for unknown reasons, are
poorly tolerated in AL compared to multiple myeloma
with fluid retention, fatigue and a recently identified phe￾nomenon of a paradoxical increase in cardiac biomarkers
during therapy;74 all these issues need further study. The
latter is of particular significance given its role in assessing
cardiac responses in AL amyloidosis although a rise in the
NT pro-BNP following the first cycle of lenalidomide was
not associated with poor survival or renal deterioration.24
Proteasome inhibitor-based regimes
Bortezomib-based regimens have changed the treatment
paradigm in AL amyloidosis over the last few years.
Plasma cells in AL amyloidosis appear to be especially sen￾sitive to proteasome inhibitors in a pre-clinical model;75 the
accumulation of pre-fibrillar light chains after proteasome
inhibition adding to the cellular toxicity. The high response
rates and good tolerance have led to bortezomib combina￾tions being adopted as front-line therapy in AL amyloido￾sis. Prospective evidence of superiority or better tolerability
over current standard regimens, particularly in elderly sub￾jects with advanced cardiac disease, is still lacking. 
A multicenter retrospective analysis of 94 patients
showed high hematologic response rates (71%) achieved
rapidly (a median response time of 52 days) with associat￾ed organ responses in 30%. The 1-year survival rate was

76%. One-third experienced grade 3 toxicity and the most
common non-hematologic side effects included peripheral
sensory neuropathy, orthostatic hypotension, gastroin￾testinal disturbance or peripheral edema.32 A prospective
phase I/II trial confirmed the high response rate and
reported similar efficacy in patients with relapsed refracto￾ry AL amyloidosis with both once (OW) or twice (TW)
weekly schedules in 70 patients.31 Hematologic response,
median time to best response, one year PFS and grade 3 or
greater toxicities were 68.8%/66.7%, 3.2/1.2 months,
72.2/74.6% and 50%/79%, respectively, in the OW and
TW groups.31
A number of groups, including our own, have now stud￾ied bortezomib with additional cyclophosphamide
(CyBorD) or melphalan (BMDex) in AL amyloidosis.34,76
Of 17 patients receiving CyBorD at the Mayo Clinic (58%
with symptomatic cardiac involvement), a clonal response
was achieved in a median of 2 months in 94%, with 71%
and 24% achieving a CR and PR, respectively.34 In the UK,
43 patients received CyBorD (bi-weekly bortezomib)
(74%; cardiac involvement and 46% stage III by the Mayo
cardiac staging), with overall hematologic response rates
of 81% (CR 42%).33 The estimated 2-year PFS was 66%
and 41% for front-line treatment and relapsed setting,
respectively. The estimated 2-year OS was 98%.33
BMDex has been studied in a prospective trial in the
US77 and in a retrospective cohort in Italy.50 An early
report from the prospective study has shown a 94%
hematologic response rate with 38% CRs. However, in
the retrospective study, hematologic response rates were
48% (CR 18%, VGPR 21%) with BMDex and the absolute
dFLC decrease in responders 95%, significantly greater
than those treated with MDex (median 83%; P=0.018).
The lower overall response rate in this study was due to
early deaths in cardiac patients and similar results now
reported with larger CyBorD treated cohorts,78 highlight￾ing a possible concern using bortezomib in advanced car￾diac disease. A randomized prospective trial is ongoing in
Europe and Australia comparing MDex with BMDex.
Ixazomib and carfilzomib are novel proteasome inhibitors
appearing to have greater efficacy of proteasome inhibi￾tion compared with bortezomib with a more favorable
toxicity profile. A phase I study of ixazomib has been
completed with good tolerance and responses seen in mul￾tiple refractory patients.79 A phase III trial is ongoing. 
Allogeneic stem cell transplantation
Allogeneic stem cell transplantation is not widely used
in AL amyloidosis. Following the first successful case,
reported in 1998,80 a European Group for Blood and
Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) registry study in 2005
reported 19 patients with AL amyloidosis (7 patients full
intensity conditioning; 8 reduced intensity conditioning
(RIC)). The overall and progression free survival was 60%
and 53%, respectively, at one year, with TRM of 40%
(TRM 50% in patients receiving total body irradiation).
Ten patients achieved hematologic responses and 8
attained organ responses.81 Anecdotal reports suggest RIC￾SCT is possible in AL.82 Currently, allogeneic stem cell
transplantation may have a role in highly selected young
fit patients with relapsed disease but, ideally, should only
be considered in the context of a clinical trial. 
An approach to treatment 
The treatment strategy in a patient with AL amyloidosis
is shaped by poignant background factors including age,
co-morbidities, performance status, contraindications to
drugs and patient preference deciding the ultimate choice
of the regimen, especially in the lack of clear randomized
evidence. Figure 5 provides a suggested treatment algo￾rithm for patients treated outside of clinical trials. The
choice of up-front treatment is between autologous stem
cell transplantation (ASCT) and combination chemothera￾py, one not necessarily precluding the other. Patients with
good performance status, limited organ involvement,
good renal function, cardiac ejection fraction over 50%,
CO diffusion capacity over 50%, cardiac troponin T
below 0.06 ng/L and NT-proBNP below 5000 ng/L appear
to have a less than 5% TRM during ASCT57,83,84 and
should be offered ASCT as a treatment choice. Borderline
patients treated with a stem cell sparing regime with
improved organ function may allow ASCT at a later date.
Bortezomib has emerged as the backbone of induction
regimens; CyBorD or BMDex are becoming the regimens
of choice in most non-neuropathic patients. Cautious low￾dose regimens are needed in advanced cardiac involve￾ment (especially with NT-proBNP >8500ng/L). Patients
with neuropathy pose a dilemma, with melphalan/dex￾amethasone or lenalidomide/dexamethasone as suitable
up-front treatments. Response reassessment at the 3-
month point interval is key; patients with a poor response
should be considered for either dose increments or an
additional drug to improve the response. 
Best organ responses occur in those achieving a hemato￾logic CR/VGPR, but partial responders may also achieve
an organ response. Lenalidomide and pomalidomide￾based regimens or bendamustine are useful in the
relapsed/refractory setting. The value of alkylator-based
regimes in patients relapsing after a novel agent-based
regime is uncertain. 
IgM associated AL amyloidosis
Of all patients with amyloidosis, 4-7% have an IgM
secreting (mainly) lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (LPL) as
the underlying cause of AL.85,86 Treatment should be direct￾ed toward the LPL clone. Single agent alkylators have lim￾ited efficacy. Regimes such as melphalan/dexamethasone
(n=14), purine analogs (n=17) confer good hematologic
responses of 64% and 73%, respectively.85,86 Recently, rit￾uximab/bortezomib/dexamethasone shows promise,
with overall hematologic responses of 78% (n=7).87 Larger
clinical trials are needed to evaluate this further. 
Organ transplantation
Organ transplantation can be considered in patients
attaining a vGPR or better with irreversible end-stage
organ function, or in a situation to facilitate aggressive
chemotherapy, not otherwise feasible due to organ dys￾function. Long-term control of the underlying clonal disor￾der is needed to prevent recurrence after organ transplan￾tation or progression in other organs. 
Cardiac transplantation may be the only option to
improve survival in younger patients with advanced iso￾lated heart involvement, accounting for 0.14% of heart
transplants nationwide according to the United Network
for Organ Sharing (UNOS).88 A UK study reported 24
patients from 1984 to 2002 undergoing heart transplanta￾tion in 6 UK cardiac transplant centers, 17 diagnosed with
AL amyloidosis. The 1- and 5-year OS was 50% and 20%,
respectively, not receiving chemotherapy versus 71% and

36% who did.89 Another multicenter study of 69 patients
receiving heart transplants for amyloidosis (all types),
reported 1- and 5-year survival of 74.6% and 54%, respec￾tively.88 Control of the underlying clone is important, and
ASCT is generally considered most appropriate treatment.
One US series between 1994 and 2005 included 11
patients undergoing the two procedures serially. Nine
patients survived both with 3 eventually dying due to pro￾gressive amyloidosis, the earliest 55 months post ASCT.
The 1- and 5-year survival following heart transplantation
in this cohort was 82% and 65%, respectively,77,90 a
marked improvement over the otherwise median survival
of advanced cardiac AL of 3-8 months. Scarcity of organs,
risk of amyloid recurrence, and higher mortality of amy￾loid patients undergoing heart transplants still makes car￾diac transplantation a contentious issue.88 
Renal transplantation in AL amyloidosis is considered to
improve long-term survival and quality of life. The largest
UK series reports 22 patients undergoing renal transplan￾tation; (19 cadaveric donors and 3 live donors), and 3 with
extra-renal organ dysfunction. Nineteen patients received
chemotherapy or ASCT, 74% achieving a hematologic
response (11 PR and 3 CR) with no graft failures secondary
to amyloid recurrence and 1- and 5-year OS 95% and
67%, respectively.91 The Mayo group reported 19 patients
receiving renal transplantation (1 cadaveric donor and 18
live donors), 12 having extra-renal involvement from 1999
to 2008. All attained a hematologic response (18 CR and 1
PR), 8 receiving renal transplantation followed by ASCT, 6
receiving ASCT followed by renal transplantation, and 5
receiving non-myeloablative chemotherapy followed by
renal transplantation, with no significant difference
between these groups. The 1- and 5-year OS was 84%
and 76%, respectively.91 Good long-term outcomes appear
to be associated with renal transplantation in AL in highly
selected cases.
Outcomes with orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT)
for advanced liver AL remain poor. A UK study from 1984
to 2009 included 9 patients undergoing an OLT with the 1-
and 5-year survival from transplantation 33% and 22%,
respectively.91 
Novel therapies for amyloidosis
A number of therapies are in development targeting var￾ious components of the pathophysiology of amyloid fib￾rillogenesis. Glycosaminoglycans are a universal con￾stituent of all amyloid deposits and inhibition of the inter￾action between GAGs and amyloid fibrils. This is a prom￾ising therapeutic approach AA type which may also have
merit in AL. Eprodisate (Kiacta®, Bellus Health, Canada) is
a negatively charged, sulfonated molecule of low molecu￾lar weight and is undergoing phase III trials.92 There is
growing interest in developing therapeutic antibodies to
directly target amyloid deposits. Mu 11-1F4 is a chimeric
antibody reactive with many AL fibrils,93 localization of
which has been studied in patients with PET imaging.94 Its
administration as a therapeutic is planned. mAb2A4 is
another monoclonal antibody, binding AL/AA fibrils and
human AL amyloid extracts,95 reported to cause amyloid
regression in mouse models of AA and AL amyloidosis.
This antibody has been further developed as NEOD001
(Onclave Therapeutics Limited, CA, USA), recently com￾mencing phase I trials in systemic amyloidosis in the US.
Pre-clinical development of small interfering RNAs
(siRNAs) has also been explored as a treatment in reducing
the expression of the amyloid precursor protein, with in
vitro studies showing inhibition of synthesis of light
chains in transfected cells, and in vivo reducing the produc￾tion and circulating free light chains.96
R-1-[6-[R-2-carboxy-pyrrolidin-1-yl]-6-oxo￾hexanoyl]pyrrolidine-2-carboxylic acid (CPHPC) is a drug
which cross-links pairs of SAP molecules in vivo97 resulting
in rapid clearance of SAP from the liver and almost com￾plete depletion of plasma SAP.98 Some SAP persists on the
amyloid deposits, and lack of plasma SAP allows adminis￾tration of an anti-SAP antibody which can now target the
amyloid deposits. Following promising results in trans￾genic mouse model of AA amyloidosis, using anti-SAP
immunoglobulin-G (IgG) antibodies and CPHPC,99 early
phase clinical trials are underway to explore this further
with initial patient recruitment commencing this year.
Conclusion
AL amyloidosis is rare. It is frequently diagnosed late
due to the subtle signs and symptoms of the disease.
Increasing awareness of this disease poses major chal￾lenges. Improved diagnostic techniques have enabled bet￾ter detection of this disease. Risk stratification using car￾diac biomarkers has refined treatment selection and
reduced morbidity and TRM. Diagnosis and treatment
planning in AL is complex and best considered in specialist
centers that have the expertise of a multi-disciplinary
team. Novel agent-based chemotherapy, especially with
bortezomib, has improved chemotherapy responses and is
being explored pre- and post-ASCT. Bendamustine,
lenalidomide and pomalidomide are valuable therapies for
relapsed refractory patients. Good hematologic responses
(attaining at least a vGPR being the goal of therapy)22
translates into organ responses and improved survival.
While cardiac and hematologic responses can be simulta￾neous, responses of other organs may evolve over months
or years. Early mortality of patients with advanced disease
persists. Future directions involving therapies targeting the
amyloid deposits - anti-fibril antibodies are in early phase
trials. Exploring the role of minimal residual disease, the
importance of eradicating this and gaining insight into the
microenvironment are needed. Ultimately, the most
important factor is increasing awareness to ensure early
diagnosis to allow therapy before extensive organ involve￾ment.
