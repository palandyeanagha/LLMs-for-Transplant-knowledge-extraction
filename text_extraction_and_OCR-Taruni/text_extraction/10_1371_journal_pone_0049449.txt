Abstract
Polyomaviruses are small circular DNA viruses associated with chronic infections and tumors in both human and animal
hosts. Using an unbiased deep sequencing approach, we identified a novel, highly divergent polyomavirus, provisionally
named MX polyomavirus (MXPyV), in stool samples from children. The ,5.0 kB viral genome exhibits little overall homology
(,46% amino acid identity) to known polyomaviruses, and, due to phylogenetic variation among its individual proteins,
cannot be placed in any existing taxonomic group. PCR-based screening detected MXPyV in 28 of 834 (3.4%) fecal samples
collected from California, Mexico, and Chile, and 1 of 136 (0.74%) of respiratory samples from Mexico, but not in blood or
urine samples from immunocompromised patients. By quantitative PCR, the measured titers of MXPyV in human stool at
10% (weight/volume) were as high as 15,075 copies. No association was found between the presence of MXPyV and
diarrhea, although girls were more likely to shed MXPyV in the stool than boys (p = 0.012). In one child, viral shedding was
observed in two stools obtained 91 days apart, raising the possibility of chronic infection by MXPyV. A multiple sequence
alignment revealed that MXPyV is a closely related variant of the recently reported MWPyV and HPyV10 polyomaviruses.
Further studies will be important to determine the association, if any, of MXPyV with disease in humans.

Introduction
Polyomaviruses are small, circular DNA viruses that can cause
persistent infections in both animals and humans, and are also
potentially oncogenic [1]. In humans, polyomaviruses are associ￾ated with a broad spectrum of diseases ranging from progressive
multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) (JCV, JC virus) to
nephropathy (BKV, BK virus), to Merkel cell cancer (MCV,
Merkel cell virus) [2,3,4,5]. Ongoing efforts to identify and
characterize novel polyomaviruses are important as they may yield
valuable insights into the establishment of latent infections and
viral carcinogenesis.
The human polyomaviruses JCV and BKV, initially described
in 1971 [6,7], are closely related to each other genetically and have
high seroprevalence rates in adults, exceeding 40% [8,9]. BKV
can establish a chronic infection in the kidneys [10], and causes
nephropathy and hemorrhagic cystitis in transplant patients [2],
although it can also be detected in urine from healthy individuals
[8]. JCV also latently infects the kidneys [11], but in immuno￾compromised individuals, especially in patients with HIV, can
invade the central nervous system and cause PML, a life￾threatening demyelinating illness associated with headaches,
memory loss, and neurological deficits [4]. Up until 2007, the
only two polyomaviruses known to infect humans were JCV and
BKV, but recent advances in sequencing technologies have since
led to the discovery of many additional human polyomaviruses.
The WU and KI polyomaviruses were initially described in 2007
in children with acute respiratory illness [12,13], but the exact
pathogenic role of these viruses in respiratory disease remains
controversial [14]. These viruses have been found to infect the
respiratory tract of up to 7% of children
[12,13,15,16,17,18,19,20], with or without respiratory symptoms,
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 November 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 11 | e49449

and, like BCV and JCV, seroprevalence rates in both children and
adult populations are high [8,9]. MCV was first described in 2008
in association with a rare but aggressive type of skin cancer called
Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) [3]. In tumor cells, MCV integrates
into the host genome and is unable to replicate due to truncation
mutations in the viral T antigen [21]. The direct etiologic role of
MCV in oncogenesis was demonstrated by cell death and
regression of MCC tumors upon knockdown of the viral T
antigen [5]. Since the discovery of MCV, three additional human
polyomaviruses infecting skin, HPyV6, HPyV7, and TSV
(trichodysplasia spinulosa-associated polyomavirus) [22,23,24],
and a ninth polyomavirus from the blood of immunosuppressed
patients, HPyV9, were discovered [25]. Most recently, new
polyomaviruses MWPyV and HPyV10 have been detected in
human stool specimens [26] and in condyloma (wart) specimens
from a patient with WHIM (warts, hypogammaglobulinemia,
infections, and myelokathexis) syndrome [27], respectively.
Unbiased DNA sequencing is rapidly becoming the method of
choice for pathogen discovery, as high-throughput or ‘‘deep’’
sequencing of clinical samples facilitates the identification of novel,
highly divergent pathogens that would elude detection by
conventional PCR assays [28,29]. Previously, we have shown that
by shotgun sequencing as few as 1 million reads per clinical
sample, sensitivities of detection comparable to PCR (,100 copies
per mL) can be achieved for both known and candidate novel
viruses [30]. Here we describe the identification and molecular
characterization of a new human polyomavirus, provisionally
named MX polyomavirus (MXPyV), in diarrheal stool collected
from a child in Mexico. Subsequent PCR-based screening of stool
samples reveals that the MXPyV has a broad geographic
distribution and that persistent shedding of the virus may occur
in infected individuals.
Methods
Stool sample collection, nucleic acid extraction, and
Illumina deep sequencing
Anonymized samples were collected from 96 children with
acute diarrheal disease from 3 different states in Mexico between
2008–2009. Diarrhea was defined as three or more loose or liquid
stools per day, and samples were taken from children prior to
treatment with rehydration and antibiotics (if indicated). Viral
particles were purified from stool samples by generating a
suspension consisting of 1 mL phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1 g
of glass beads, 100 mL of chloroform, and 0.2 g of feces,
shaking65 min using a mechanical shaker, spinning620 min at
1,000 g in a centrifuge, and recovering the aqueous supernatant.
500 mL of supernatant were then passed through a 0.45 mm filter
and treated with a cocktail of nucleases (Turbo DNAse, Ambion
and RNAseA, Invitrogen) prior to nucleic acid extraction using the
PureLink 96 Viral RNA/DNA Kit (Invitrogen). Sample cDNA
libraries were prepared from extracted nucleic acid using a
random PCR amplification method, separately barcoded, and
sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 as previously described
[30,31]. Raw Illumina sequences consisting of 75 base pair (bp)
paired-end reads were filtered to exclude low-complexity, homo￾polymeric, and low-quality sequences, and then processed through
an automated pipeline for pathogen identification as previously
described [30]. Sequences corresponding to MXPyV were
identified on the basis of viral BlastX homology at a threshold
E-score cutoff of 1025
.
PCR for genome recovery
Three contigs (contiguous sequences) were assembled from deep
sequencing reads bearing homology to polyomaviruses by viral
BlastX alignment (marked ‘‘C1’’, ‘‘C2’’, and ‘‘C3’’ in Fig. 1). To
bridge these contigs, long-range PCR was performed using
primers directed outward from the assembled contigs and the
PrimeStar GXL DNA Polymerase kit (Takara Bio) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. Overlapping PCR products were
cloned and sequenced in order to obtain a consensus sequence for
the complete MXPyV genome with at least 36 redundancy.
Putative open reading frames were identified using Geneious
software [32].
Phylogenetic analysis
Whole-genome sequences corresponding to all known animal
and human polyomaviruses, with the exception of the recently
discovered MWPyV and HPyV10 viruses [26,27], were down￾loaded from GenBank. Multiple sequence alignments of MXPyV
viral proteins relative to corresponding proteins from other
polyomaviruses were performed using MAFFT (v6.0) with the E￾INS-i option and at default settings [33]. Overall pairwise amino
acid identities of MXPyV relative to other polyomaviruses were
calculated by concatenating the VP1, VP2, and T-antigen protein
sequences and running MAFFT. To generate the phylogenetic
trees, Bayesian tree topologies were calculated using MrBayes
V3.2 software (5,500 sampled trees; 500 trees discarded as burn-in
for VP1, VP2, and small T antigen; 20,000 sampled trees; 10,000
trees discarded as burn-in for large T antigen needed to achieve
convergence) [34]. Bovine polyomavirus (Fig. 2, ‘‘Bovine’’) was
selected as an outgroup. Convergence was confirmed by the PSRF
statistic in MrBayes [35]. Trees were visualized using Geneious
software [32]. Multiple whole-genome sequence alignments of
MXPyV, HPyV10, and MWPyV were performed using Geneious
software [32].
PCR-based screening for MXPyV
A real-time quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) assay was
designed for detection of MXPyV from the VP1 gene, as were
two secondary conventional RT-PCR assays from another region
of the VP1 gene and the large T-antigen. A reverse transcription
step was included for all of the assays in order to enable detection
of MXPyV viral mRNA in addition to genomic DNA. To
investigate the relative contribution of MXPyV mRNA to viral
detection and assess titers of genomic MXPyV, we also performed
real-time qPCR on samples found to be MXPyV-positive by qRT￾PCR. A standard curve was calculated from 3 PCR replicates at 8
serial log dilutions of a quantified 137-bp MXPyV PCR amplicon
(Fig. S1). Assays were performed with the Qiagen One-Step RT￾PCR kit using 13.5 mL H2O, 5 mL 56 buffer, 1 mL dNTP, 1 mL
RT/Taq mix, 1.5 mL of forward and reverse 10 mM primers,
0.5 mL of 2.56 SybrGreen (for the real-time assay), and 2 mL of
extracted nucleic acid. MXPyV primers for the PCR-based assays
are listed in Table S1. A sample was considered positive for
MXPyV if confirmed by Sanger sequencing and at least two of the
three PCR-based assays were positive.
Pan-viral microarray (ViroChip) analysis of MXPyV￾positive samples from Mexico
Sufficient material was available from the stool samples from
Mexico to test the 12 MXPyV-positive samples for co-infections by
pan-viral microarray (ViroChip) and specific PCR analysis for
diarrheal viruses. ViroChip analysis was performed as previously
described [30,31]. Briefly, RNA was reverse-transcribed to cDNA

using random primers (59-GTTCCCACTGGAGGATA(N9)-39)
and second-strand synthesis was performed using Sequenase.
Samples were labeled with Cy3 fluorescent dye, normalized to
10 pmol of incorporated dye, and hybridized overnight to the
ViroChip microarray for 16 hr at 65uC. The current 8660 k
version 5.0 (v5.0) ViroChip microarrays used in this study (GEO
accession number GPL15905) are manufactured commercially on
an Agilent platform (Agilent Technologies), and contain 19,058
70mer oligonucleotide probes representing all viral species in
GenBank. Microarrays were scanned at 2 mm resolution on an
Agilent DNA Microarray Scanner. Microarray hybridization
patterns were interpreted using cluster and single oligonucleotide
Z-score analysis as previously described [30,31,36,37]. Samples
were declared positive for a diarrheal virus by microarray if
positive by both cluster and Z-score analysis.
Diarrheal viral PCR analysis of MXPyV-positive samples
from Mexico
PCR for 5 diarrheal viruses (calicivirus, astrovirus, adenovirus,
rotavirus, and enterovirus) was performed using randomly
amplified cDNA as a template. Primer pairs are listed in Table
S1. All PCR assays were run in a total of 20 mL with 16 PCR

Prevalence study populations
Mexico. Stool samples from 96 children with diarrheal
disease (including the initial MXPyV-positive case identified) were
extracted and tested for MXPyV by PCR. Nasal washes from 136
hospitalized children with pneumonia collected from 2010–2012
were extracted using the PureLink 96 Viral RNA/DNA Kit
(Invitrogen) and tested for MXPyV.
California (SIFT Study). The stool samples corresponding
to the SIFT (Stanford Infection and Familial Transmission) study
have been described previously [38]. Briefly, 553 stool samples
from 406 individuals, nearly all children, with or without
symptoms of gastroenteritis, were available for study. Stool
samples were collected around the time of an initial gastroenteritis
episode, and individuals were surveyed for the presence or absence
of diarrhea, vomiting, or both within the prior 2 weeks. Additional
stool samples were also occasionally collected 3 months after the
initial episode. Stool was suspended in 2 mL of PBS at 10% weight
per volume and the PureLink 96 Viral RNA/DNA Kit
(Invitrogen) was used to extract nucleic acid for MXPyV testing.
Chile. 192 samples (96 from children with diarrhea and 96
from age-/sex- matched controls) collected between 2009–2011
from Chile were available for testing. Viral particles were enriched
by filtration and nuclease treatment prior to nucleic acid
extraction using the QIAAMP Viral Ultrasens Kit (Qiagen).
California (UCSF Study). 193 plasma samples from solid
organ and bone marrow transplant recipients at UCSF sent in
2012 for cytomegalovirus (CMV) testing, with 31 (16%) samples
positive for CMV, and 287 plasma/urine samples from predom￾inantly renal transplant recipients sent in 2012 for BKV testing,
with 162 (56%) samples positive for BKV, were tested for
MXPyV. Viral DNA extractions were performed using the
automated Qiagen EZ1 instrument (Qiagen) according to the
manufacturer’s protocol.
Nucleotide sequence accession numbers
The annotated, complete genome of MXPyV has been
submitted to GenBank (accession number JX259273). Deep

Results
Discovery and Whole-Genome Sequencing of MXPyV
Eighty stool samples selected from an ongoing investigation of
pediatric gastroenteritis from Mexico were analyzed by unbiased
Illumina paired-end sequencing. Samples were individually
barcoded and sequenced in pools containing 16 samples each.
Each pool was subjected to an automated viral discovery pipeline
using GenBank database searches and categorized into human,
bacterial, phage, unknown, and viral sequences [30]. In one pool
consisting of 79,013,460 paired-end sequences, three 100-bp
reads, all derived from a single barcoded sample from a 2-year
child with diarrhea, were found to have amino acid homology to
polyomaviruses by BLASTx. These 3 reads and their correspond￾ing mate pairs were aligned using BLASTn at a E-score cutoff of
10210 to the full deep sequencing dataset corresponding to the
barcoded sample (17,981,772 reads) and the resulting identified
read pairs assembled to generate 3 contigs (contiguous sequences)
192, 275, and 261 bp in length (Fig. 1, ‘‘C1’’, ‘‘C2’’, and ‘‘C3’’).
The closest protein hits to the translated C1, C2, or C3 contigs in
the GenBank viral database included VP3 from orangutan
polyomavirus (GenBank CAX87756, E-score = 9610211, 81%
identity), VP1 from TSV (GenBank YP_003800006, E￾score = 7610230, 52% identity), and the large T antigen from
orangutan polyomavirus (GenBank CAX87759, E￾score = 1610225, 61% identity), respectively. Using long-range
PCR with primers directed outward from each of the 3 contigs, the
entire genome of the novel polyomavirus was then cloned and
sequenced from three overlapping fragments by long-range PCR.

Genomic organization and phylogenetic analysis
The genome of MXPyV is circular and 4,939 nt in length
(accession number JX259273), encoding predicted full-length open
reading frames for all of the major polyomavirus proteins (Fig. 1A).
The organization is typical for a member of the Polyomaviridae
family with an early region consisting of regulatory small-T (ST￾Ag) and large-T antigens (LT-Ag) and a late region coding for the
VP1, VP2, and VP3 structural proteins. Phylogenetic analysis of
the VP1, VP2, ST-Ag, and LT-Ag proteins of MXPyV revealed
that the taxonomic placement of MXPyV varies from protein to
protein (Fig. 2). In VP1 and the large T-antigen, MXPyV shares
the most homology with the recently described new human
polyomaviruses (HPyV6, HPyV7, WU, and KI), whereas in VP2
or the small T-antigen, MXPyV clusters with the rodent
polyomaviruses or forms an independent phylogenetic branch,
respectively. Both the regulatory and structural proteins of
MXPyV differ substantially in amino acid sequence from those
of other polyomaviruses, with identities ranging from 13–44%
(Fig. 3).
Regulatory region
Situated between the early and late regions of polyomaviruses is a
non-coding regulatory region which contains the origin of
replication as well as transcriptional promoters/enhancers. Typical
of nearly all polyomaviruses, the regulatory region of MXPyV was
found to contain an AT-rich region on the late side of the putative
replication origin (nt 26–57). However, only three T antigen￾binding sites, defined by the conserved pentameric GAGGC
sequence, were identified in the regulatory region, unlike most
polyomaviruses, which contain four to seven such sites. Two of the
three T-antigen binding sites in the MXPyV regulatory region were
found to combine to form a pentanucleotide palindrome
(GAGGCN4GCCTC), a feature found in most polyomaviruses.
Among human polyomaviruses 1 through 9, only HPyV6 (n = 2)
and HPyV7 (n = 1) have fewer T-antigen binding sites than
MXPyV.
Early Region
As typical for polyomaviruses, the LT-Ag of MXPyV is spliced.
The donor and acceptor splice site for the LT-Ag of MXPyV were
determined based on splice consensus sequences and alignment
with the LT-Ag of other polyomaviruses (Fig. 1A). The T-antigen
locus of MXPyV contains features conserved with other poly￾omavirus T antigens, including CR1 (LXXLL), DnaJ (HPDKGG),
a pRB1-binding motif (LXCXE), two PP2A binding sites
(CXCX2C), a zinc finger domain (CX2CX5HX3H), and a
helicase/adenosine triphosphatase (ATPse) domain (GPX3GKT)
(Fig. 1B). The nuclear localization signal and host range domain,
though present in SV40, BK, and JC virus [39,40,41,42,43], do
not appear to be conserved in MXPyV.

Discovery of a Novel Polyomavirus in Diarrhea

Late Region
MXPyV retains the core features common to all known
polyomaviruses in the late region, including putative open reading
frames for the VP1, VP2, and VP3 capsid proteins, encoding of
VP3 in the same ORF as VP2 by use of an internal start codon,
and an overlap between VP1 and VP3. Unlike BKV, JCV, SV40,
and SV12, there is no ORF for an agnoprotein upstream of the
VP2 gene.
Prevalence of MX polyomavirus in clinical samples
We designed real-time quantitative RT-PCR and PCR assays
targeting the VP1 gene to investigate the prevalence of MX
polyomavirus in clinical samples (Tables 1 and 2). The inclusion of
the reverse transcriptase step greatly improved the sensitivity of
detection of MXPyV (Table 2), presumably by enhancing
detection of viral mRNA transcripts in infected host cells. RT￾PCR/PCR results were confirmed by visualization of an expected￾size band on gel electrophoresis, melting curve analysis, and
sequencing. All positive results were also independently confirmed
using two additional conventional RT-PCR assays targeting the
LT-Ag gene and a different region of the VP1 gene. MXPyV was
detected in stool samples from children with or without diarrhea
on two continents, with prevalence rates of 12.5% (12 of 96) in
Mexico, 3.3% (18 of 546) in California, and 4.2% (4 of 96) in
Chile. Sequence variation within the 138 nt fragment varied from
0.0–4.3% (data not shown). Analysis of MXPyV-positive stools
from Mexico using the ViroChip pan-viral microarray and
diarrheal virus PCR identified known pathogenic diarrheal viruses
in 50% (6 of 12) samples (Table S2). Among the MXPyV-positive
samples from California for which clinical and demographic data
were available, no association was noted between diarrhea and
MXPyV infection (Table 3). Interestingly, a child from California
was found to be MXPyV-positive both at the time of an acute
gastroenteritis episode and 3 months later, suggesting that
persistent viral shedding of MXPyV in stool may occur (Table 4).
In addition, girls overall were found to be more likely infected by
MXPyV than boys (p = 0.012) (Table 4). Given the known
association of BK and JC virus with disease or asymptomatic
shedding in immunocompromised individuals, we also screened
for MXPyV in 480 plasma and urine samples from transplant
patients at a single hospital in California, with all samples testing
negative. Furthermore, 136 respiratory samples from Mexico from
hospitalized children with pneumonia were screened, with only
one sample (0.74%) confirmed positive for MXPyV infection
(Table 1). This sample corresponded to a child with pneumonia
who was also found to be co-infected with a rhinovirus/enterovirus
by RT-PCR.
Discussion
Here we identified and sequenced the entire genome of a novel,
highly divergent polyomavirus by deep sequencing of diarrheal
samples. In accordance with the two-letter designations for human
polyomaviruses, we have provisionally named this virus MX
polyomavirus (MXPyV), after the country from which the initial
isolate was identified. The genomic organization and amino acid
sequence homology of MXPyV, as well as conservation of known
protein motifs in the T-antigen, indicate that this virus is indeed a
polyomavirus. MXPyV is broadly distributed and was recovered
from diarrheal samples from two continents, as well as from
respiratory secretions from a child with pneumonia. In addition,
independent MXPyV isolates from different individuals showed
sequence variation of 0–4.3%, and the virus was detected in
children from birth to 6 years of age.
By phylogenetic analysis, MXPyV does not consistently cluster
with any other polyomavirus taxonomic group and, indeed,
whereas MXPyV ORFs encoding VP1 and the large T-antigen
cluster with human polyomaviruses (WU, KI, HPyV6, and
HPyV7), the MXPyV ORF encoding VP2 appears to group
better with rodent polyomaviruses. In contrast, the small T￾antigen of MXPyV does not appear to cluster with any of the
known polyomavirus groups. These observations, combined with
the low amino acid identity of 13–44% in the proteins of MXPyV
relative to those of other polyomaviruses (Fig. 3), suggest that the
putative ancestral strain for MXPyV likely diverged early along
the evolutionary pathway, and raises the possibility of recombi￾nation of polyomavirus genes. Although recombination in
polyomaviruses remains controversial, it does appear to occur, at
least in JC viruses [44]. No evidence for MXPyV recombination
within individual genes was detected by bootscanning analysis
(data not shown), but this is to be expected given the high sequence
divergence of MXPyV. The whole-genome sequence of MXPyV is
nearly identical to that of the recently described gut-associated
polyomavirus MWPyV (St. Louis strain) or HPyV10 [26,27],
sharing 99.8% or 99.7% identity, respectively, and thus all 3
viruses are different variants of the same species (Fig. 4). Situated
on a highly divergent phylogenetic branch, MXPyV, MWPyV,
and HPyV10 likely represent the first members of a new subclade
of polyomaviruses.
Detection of MXPyV, as well as closely related strains MWPyV
and HPyV10, appears largely confined to the gastrointestinal tract.
MXPyV exhibited an overall prevalence of 3.4% in fecal samples
collected from California, Mexico, and Chile (Table 1), although
one respiratory sample out of 136 (0.74%) also tested positive.
SV40, BKV, JCV, and MCV have also been detected in human
feces [45,46,47], although their primary sites of pathology are

elsewhere in the human body, as have polyomaviruses WU and KI
[12,48,49]. We were unable to detect MXPyV in 480 plasma or
urine samples from highly immunocompromised transplant
recipients, indicating that these are not reservoir sites for MXPyV
infection, as is the case for JC and BK viruses.
No association between MXPyV presence and diarrhea was
detected in the California and Chile gastroenteritis studies for
which controls were available (Tables 1 and 2). In fact, in the
samples from Chile, the trend was reversed, with 4 MXPyV￾positive samples among 96 asymptomatic control individuals and
no positives among 96 children with diarrhea (Table 1). These
findings, however, do not preclude the possibility of MXPyV as an
etiologic agent of diarrhea given the fact that a large proportion of
infections from diarrheal viruses are asymptomatic [50,51].
Notably, 6 of 12 MXPyV-positive diarrheal samples from Mexico
tested negative by a broad-spectrum viral microarray and specific
PCR assays for all known diarrheal viruses (Table S2), suggesting
that MXPyV, if human-tropic, may still potentially be a cause of
gastroenteritis. Serologic testing before and after diarrheal
episodes would be useful in investigating this possibility, as shown
previously for a human cardiovirus and klassevirus/salivirus
[52,53].
In the California SIFT study, MXPyV was seen more often in
girls than in boys (13 female vs. 4 males, p = 0.012) by RT-PCR
(Table 4). Although MXPyV-specific serology is needed for
confirmation, this observation is intriguing in light of the fact that
apparent gender differences have previously been described in a
serological investigation of primary infections by Merkel cell virus
(MCV) in childhood [54]. In that study, males showed higher
seroconversion and seroprevalence rates to MCV than females.
This apparent gender difference was not observed with respect to
MCV seroprevalence in adults [9], although gender does appear
to dramatically impact incidence and survival rates associated with
Merkel cell carcinoma [55,56]. Whether differences in the age at
which MXPyV is acquired, childhood physiology, or viral
characteristics play a role in the gender differences observed here
is unknown, and merits further investigation.
Although at present we cannot exclude the possibility that
MXPyV may be of dietary origin, several lines of evidence indicate
that the virus is likely human-tropic. The enhanced sensitivity of
RT-PCR over PCR for detection of MXPyV (Table 2) suggests
that expressed viral mRNA, presumably present in infected host
cells in the feces, is being detected, implying that viral replication
occurs in the human gut. In addition, the detection of MXPyV in
a child at the time of an acute gastroenteritis episode and 3 months
later suggests that, in analogy with other human polyomaviruses
[57], chronic infection by MXPyV is possible. The detection of a
closely related variant to MXPyV, HPyV10, in tissue from a
patient with WHIM syndrome also indicates that MXPyV,
MWPyV, and HPyV10 are likely human-tropic viruses (Fig. 4).
Viral cultivation or serology will be needed for definitive
confirmation that these novel polyomaviruses can cause bona fide
infections in humans.
