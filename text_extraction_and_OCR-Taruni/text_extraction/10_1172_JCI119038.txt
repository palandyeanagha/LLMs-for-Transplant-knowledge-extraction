Abstract
Abnormal vascular smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation
and migration contribute to the development of restenosis
after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and
accelerated arteriopathy after cardiac transplantation. Pre￾viously, we reported that the macrolide antibiotic rapamy￾cin, but not the related compound FK506, inhibits both hu￾man and rat aortic SMC proliferation in vitro by inhibiting
cell cycle–dependent kinases and delaying phosphorylation
of retinoblastoma protein (Marx, S.O., T. Jayaraman, L.O.
Go, and A.R. Marks. 1995. Circ. Res. 362:801). In the
present study the effects of rapamycin on SMC migration
were assayed in vitro using a modified Boyden chamber and
in vivo using a porcine aortic SMC explant model. Pretreat￾ment with rapamycin (2 ng/ml) for 48 h inhibited PDGF￾induced migration (PDGF BB homodimer; 20 ng/ml) in cul￾tured rat and human SMC (n 5 10; P , 0.0001), whereas
FK506 had no significant effect on migration. Rapamycin
administered orally (1 mg/kg per d for 7 d) significantly in￾hibited porcine aortic SMC migration compared with con￾trol (n 5 15; P , 0.0001). Thus, in addition to being a po￾tent immunosuppressant and antiproliferative, rapamycin
also inhibits SMC migration. (J. Clin. Invest. 1996. 98:2277–

Abnormal vascular smooth muscle cell (SMC)1
 proliferation
and migration play major roles in the formation of atheroscle￾rotic plaques, in the development of restenosis after percuta￾neous transluminal angioplasty (PTCA) and in accelerated ar￾teriopathy after cardiac transplantation (1–5). In normal
vessels, the majority of SMC reside in the media, where they
are quiescent and possess a “contractile” phenotype (1, 6)
characterized by the abundance of actin- and myosin-contain￾ing filaments. In disease states, SMC reenter the cell cycle,
proliferate, and migrate from the media to the intima (1).
PDGF is a potent chemoattractant for SMC (6–8) and is
thought to play a major role in stimulating SMC migration in
experimental models of vessel injury (9, 10). After vessel in￾jury, intimal SMC demonstrate a synthetic phenotype, secret￾ing extracellular matrix, proteases, growth factors, and cyto￾kines that contribute to further proliferation and migration (1,
5, 6).
Recently, we reported that rapamycin, a macrolide antibi￾otic, inhibited both human and rat SMC proliferation by
blocking cell cycle progression at the G1/S transition (11). This
inhibition of cell proliferation was associated with decreases in
cell cycle kinase activity and a reduction in the phosphoryla￾tion of retinoblastoma protein. We demonstrated that the anti￾proliferative properties of rapamycin were mediated through
binding to the cytosolic receptor, FK506 binding protein
(FKBP12) (11). FKBP12 is ubiquitously and abundantly ex￾pressed in many cells and tissues and is highly conserved
throughout eukaryotic phylogeny (12–16). FKBPs catalyze the
cis–trans isomerization of peptidyl-prolyl amide bonds of pep￾tides; both rapamycin and FK506 inhibit this rotamase activity.
However, the inhibition of rotamase activity is not responsible
for the immunosuppressive effects of these agents (17).
In the present study, we demonstrate that rapamycin, but
not FK506, blocks rat, porcine, and human SMC migration.
The inhibitory effects on migration are competed by molar ex￾cesses of FK506, indicating that the effect is mediated through
binding to the cytosolic receptor, FKBP12. In rat aortic SMC,
the inhibition of rapamycin of both proliferation and migration
is mediated through a novel form of FKBP12 which contains
three amino acid substitutions compared with the human
FKBP12, including a serine substitution for a highly conserved
proline at residue 10. The present data indicate that a target of
the rapamycin-FKBP12 complex or a downstream effector
molecule functions as a critical regulator of SMC migration.
Methods
Reagents. Rapamycin was a gift from Dr. Suren Sehgal (Wyeth￾Ayerst Laboratories, Princeton, NJ), FK506 was from Fujisawa
(Deerfield, IL), recombinant human PDGF-BB was from Cal Bio￾chem (Stanford, CA).
Cell culture. Rat aortic SMC (passages 8-11) were cultured in
DME plus 20% FCS (Gibco, Grand Island, NY), 100 U/ml penicillin,
and 100 mg/ml streptomycin as previously described (11, 18). The me￾dium was changed every 48 h, and cells were passaged at z 75% con￾fluence. Human aortic SMC (passages 3–5), were obtained from the
ascending aorta at the time of cardiac transplantation. The adventitia
and connective tissue were removed, the remaining arterial intima
and media were cut into 1-cm2
 segments, and placed in culture dishes
with collagenase and 15% FCS. Cells were grown in DME medium
supplemented with 20% FCS, 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml
streptomycin. Aortic SMC were serially passaged before reaching
confluence. Cells were identified as smooth muscle by their typical

appearance on light microscopy and by immunostaining with anti–
smooth muscle a-actin 1A4 (M851; Dako Inc., Carpenteria, CA).
Smooth muscle cell migration assay. Migration was measured us￾ing a 48-well chamber (modified Boyden chamber) housing a poly￾carbonate filter with 8-mm pores (Nucleopore, Cabin John, MD) (19).
Each membrane was coated with 0.1 mg/ml of collagen (Vitrogen
100®; Centrix, Santa Clara, CA) in 0.2 M acetic acid for 24 h before
each chemotactic assay. For each assay, 27 ml of PDGF-BB (20 ng/
ml) in DME plus 0.2% BSA were loaded in quadruplicate wells in the
bottom chamber. BSA (0.2% in DME without PDGF) was used as a
negative control. SMC were grown to z 30% confluence. Rapamycin
or FK506 was then added directly to the culture media of some plates,
control was without drug. After 48 h of incubation, cells were
trypsinized, washed three times with PBS, and counted with a
hemocytometer. Cell viability was determined by trypan blue exclu￾sion. To examine the acute effect of rapamycin on SMC migration,
rapamycin (100 ng/ml) was added directly to the upper or lower
chamber without pretreatment. SMC grown in the absence of rapa￾mycin were loaded in the upper chamber.
Equal numbers of cells (2 3 105
/ml) in 50 ml were placed in the
top chamber. After 6 h of incubation in 5% CO2
 at 378C, nonmigrat￾ing cells were scraped from the upper surface of the filter. Cells on
the lower surface were fixed with methanol and stained with Diff￾Quik (Baxter Healthcare Co., Miami, FL). The number of SMC on
the lower surface of the filter was determined microscropically by
counting five high power (3400) fields of constant area per well. Val￾ues are expressed as the percentage of cells migrating in response to
PDGF-BB after subtraction of the negative control (DME 1 BSA).
Experiments were performed at least twice using quadruplicate wells.
Statistical significance was determined using the unpaired Student’s t
test; P , 0.01 was considered a significant result.
Northern analyses. Total RNA was prepared from SMC growing
in log phase using the standard guanidinium-isothiocyanate lysis
buffer and centrifugation through a cesium chloride cushion as de￾scribed elsewhere (20). 20 mg of total RNA was size fractionated on a
1% formaldehyde agarose gel, blotted to nitrocellulose, and probed
with a￾32P-labeled FKBP12 cDNA randomly labeled to a specific ac￾tivity of 109
 cpm/mg. The FKBP12 cDNA probe contained the entire
coding region of the rabbit FKBP12 (16). Hybridization was at 428C
overnight and final washing at 658C in 0.2 3 SSC. Films were autora￾diographed with a single intensifying screen at 2708C for 48 h. Ethid￾ium bromide staining of the 28S ribosomal RNA was used to ensure
that equivalent amounts of RNA were loaded in each lane. Northern
analyses were repeated at least three times with the same results, a
representative blot is shown.
Immunoblots. SMC growing in log phase were washed twice with
ice-cold PBS and lysates were prepared using modified RIPA buffer
(50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 250 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 50 mM NaF,
0.1 mM Na3VO4
, 0.5 mM PMSF, 1 mg/ml aprotinin, 1 mg/ml leupeptin,
1% NP-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS). Cells were
scraped off the bottom of the plates and lysates rocked for 1 h at 48C.
Lysates were clarified by centrifugation on a table top centrifuge for
20 min at 14,000 at 48C. Protein concentration was measured using
the Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Richmond, CA) with
BSA as a standard. Protein extracts (50 mg) were size-fractionated on
15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose over￾night at 45–60 V. Filters were blocked in PBS containing 0.1% Tween
20 (PBS-T), and 5% dry milk for 1 h at 308C, followed by incubation
overnight at 48C with either an anti-FKBP12 antibody directed
against the amino-terminus of FKBP12 (16) or against the carboxy
terminus (1/1,000, gift from Dr. Greg Wiederrecht, Merck Research
Laboratory). The filters were washed with PBS-T, then incubated
with secondary antibody conjugated to peroxidase for 1 h at 48C and
washed; signals were detected using the chemiluminescence detection
system (ECL; Bio-Rad) followed by exposure to Kodak XAR film.
Library screening. A rat aortic SMC oligo-dT primed cDNA li￾brary in lZAPII was screened using a full-length rabbit FKBP12
cDNA that includes the entire coding region of FKBP12 as described
previously (16). A total of 106
 recombinants were screened at high
stringency (final wash was 0.1 3 SSC at 658C). After tertiary screen￾ing, five FKBP12 cDNA clones were isolated. The sequence reported
in this study was obtained from five independent cDNA clones using
the dideoxy chain termination methodology (20).
Explant model. 15 adult Yorkshire albino pigs (body wt 30–35
kg) were randomly assigned to receive either regular pig chow or pig
chow plus rapamycin for 7 d. Three animals received 1 mg/kg of rapa￾mycin orally and four animals received 5 mg/kg for 7 d. Animals were
euthanized with 10 ml of Sleepaway (26% sodium pentobarbital, 10%
isopropyl alcohol, 20% polyethelene glycol; Fort Dodge Laborato￾ries, Fort Dodge, IA). The aortas were perfused in situ with ice-cold
physiologic buffer at a pressure of 100 mmHg. The aortas were ex￾cised, adventitia and surrounding connective tissue were removed.
Aortas were opened by a longitudinal cut and the intima as well as a
thin portion of the subjacent media were removed. The media were
divided into five 10 3 10-mm2
 segments that were cut into multiple
2 3 2-mm2
 segments and placed in 100-mm culture dishes containing
10 ml of DMEM 1 20% FBS. Culture media were changed every 3–4 d.
On days 5, 10, and 15, culture dishes were washed with PBS to re￾move cellular debris, trypsinized briefly with 1.5 ml of trypsin, resus￾pended in 2 ml of PBS, and cells were counted (eight times per dish)
using a hemocytometer. The results are presented in Fig. 5 as mean
values6standard error of the mean for eight determinations from
each of eight control, and seven rapamycin-treated animals. Cell via￾bility was assessed using the trypan blue exclusion method. Rapamy￾cin levels in whole blood samples were determined by Wyeth-Ayerst
Laboratories. Routine histologic examinations of the aortas to assess
the effects if any of rapamycin on SMC morphology were performed
using hematoxylin and eosin stained sections.
Adhesion assay. Rat aortic SMC were incubated either with or
without 20 ng/ml of rapamycin in DMEM supplemented with 10%
FBS for 72 h. After 72 h cells were detached from the plates by brief
trypsinization in 2 ml of trypsin/EDTA, resuspended in 10 ml DMEM
1 10% FBS, and cell number was determined. There were fewer cells
in the rapamycin treated samples compared with the control (4.4 3
106
 vs 8.8 3 106
) due to the antiproliferative effect of rapamycin on
smooth muscle cells (11). Four six-well culture plates were precoated
with varying concentrations of collagen (from 1 mg/ml to 1,000 mg/ml
of Vitrogen). Smooth muscle cells were resuspended in DMEM to
give a final concentration of 2.0 3 105
 cells/ml. 1 ml of SMC was
added to each well. After 2.5 h, nonadherent cells were removed and
the number of cells adhering to the bottom of the wells was deter￾mined by counting four separate fields of constant area per well. All
experiments were performed in triplicate.
Results
Rapamycin as low as 2 ng/ml had a significant inhibitory effect
(P , 0.0001) on PDGF-BB homodimer-induced rat aortic
SMC migration (Fig. 1 A). Similarly, rapamycin significantly
inhibited PDGF-BB induced human SMC migration (Fig. 1 B;
P , 0.0001). The inhibition of migration was concentration de￾pendent with an IC50 5 2 ng/ml for both rat and human SMC.
In contrast, FK506 (1–500 ng/ml) had no significant effect on
migration in response to PDGF-BB (Fig. 1 A). The inhibition
of migration by rapamycin persisted for at least 72 h in the
Boyden chamber assays. By 96 h cell viability was substantially
decreased in both control and in rapamycin-treated cultures,
preventing assessment of cellular migration. There was no dif￾ference in cell viability between the control, FK506, and rapa￾mycin treated cells as assessed by trypan blue staining. No dif￾ference in morphology was observed comparing rat SMC from
rapamycin-treated and untreated cultures (Fig. 1 C). As previ￾ously described (11), rapamycin inhibited SMC proliferation,
whereas FK506 had no effect (data not shown). However,

equal numbers of cells were used in all migration assays. Thus
the reduction in migration did not simply reflect a difference in
cell number between control, FK506, and rapamycin treated
cells.
Addition of rapamycin (100 ng/ml) to the cells immediately
before loading into the upper Boyden chamber (Fig. 2), or in￾cubation with rapamycin (100 ng/ml) for up to 6 h (data not
shown) had no effect on migration. Similarly, rapamycin, when
added together with PDGF to the lower chamber, had no ef￾fect on the ability of PDGF to attract normal SMC (Fig. 2).
These results indicate that inhibition of SMC migration by ra￾pamycin requires . 6 h exposure to rapamycin. The inhibition
of migration of rat aortic SMC by rapamycin (100 ng/ml) was
competitively inhibited by 80610% by a 100-fold molar ex￾Figure 1. Rapamycin but not FK506 inhibits aortic smooth muscle cell migration. (A) Rat aortic SMC were cultured with either rapamycin or

cesses of FK506, indicating that the inhibition of migration by
rapamycin was mediated by the binding to the immunophilin
FKBP12, since both rapamycin and FK506 share the same cy￾tosolic receptor.
FKBP12 is ubiquitously expressed and highly conserved
across species. However, immunoblotting with an antibody
that recognizes the amino-terminus of the human, rabbit, and
murine FKBP12 did not detect FKBP protein in rat aortic
SMC (Fig. 3). In contrast, Northern hybridization using a full￾length FKBP12 cDNA revealed high levels of FKBP12 mRNA
(1.5 kb) in rat aortic SMC (Fig. 3) and an antibody directed at
the carboxyl-terminus of FKBP12 identified a 12-kD protein
in rat aortic SMC (Fig. 3). To determine the complete struc￾ture of the rat smooth muscle FKBP12, five FKBP12 cDNAs
were isolated from a rat aortic SMC library and sequenced
(Fig. 4). The rat FKBP12 encodes a 108–amino acid protein
whose sequence is 95% identical to the human and rabbit form
and 98% identical to the murine sequence. Notably, there is a
serine for proline substitution at residue 10 in the middle of the
epitope recognized by the amino-terminal FKBP12 antibody.
Rapamycin inhibits intimal thickening in rat aortas after
mechanical or alloimmune injury (21) and reduces luminal
narrowing following PTCA in porcine coronary arteries by
63% (Gallo, R., A. Padurean, J.H. Chesebro, J.T. Fallon, V.
Fuster, A.R. Marks, and J.J. Badimon, manuscript submitted
for publication). The latter study showed further that the re￾duction in luminal narrowing after PTCA was due to inhibi￾tion of intimal SMC hyperplasia typically observed in the ves￾sel wall after balloon injury. Reduction in intimal SMC
hyperplasia in rapamycin-treated animals presumably reflects
the fact that the drug causes a block in G1 to S progression in
SMC (11). However, SMC migration is also an important com￾ponent of the intimal thickening after PTCA. SMC have to mi￾grate from the media into the intima to proliferate and cause
luminal narrowing. To assess the in vivo effects of oral rapa￾mycin on SMC migration we examined the ability of cells to
migrate out of porcine aortic explants and establish cultures.
SMC from control untreated animals began to migrate out of
the explanted aortic tissue by day 5 and reached near-conflu￾ence on day 15. In contrast, SMC from animals receiving 1 mg/
kg of rapamycin did not migrate out of the aortic tissue until
day 10, and by day 15 the number of cells was significantly re￾duced despite the fact that the only exposure to rapamycin for
these cells had been in the intact animal (Fig. 5). SMC from
animals treated with 5 mg/kg of rapamycin exhibited no migra￾tion even by day 15 after explant. Histological examination re￾vealed no morphologic differences between SMC in control
versus untreated animals, and trypan blue exclusion tests re￾vealed no increase in cell death in SMC from rapamycin
treated animals. Rapamycin levels in whole blood were
3062ng/ml and 8565ng/ml for the 1 mg/kg and 5 mg/kg dosing
regimens, respectively. The concentration of 3062ng/ml is com￾parable to that observed in humans receiving rapamycin after
renal transplant, whereas the concentration of 8565ng/ml
would be considered above the recommended therapeutic lev￾els. An assay was done to determine whether rapamycin af￾fected the ability of SMC to bind to collagen. Control rat aortic
SMC and cells pretreated with rapamycin using the conditions
described above for the Boyden chamber assays were plated
on collagen coated culture dishes in DMEM. At 2.5 h there
were no significant differences between the rapamycin-treated
and the control cells in terms of the number of SMC adhering
to collagen-coated and the noncoated culture plates (control
5563, rapamycin 5863; P 5 NS). These results suggest that ra￾pamycin does not affect the ability of smooth muscle cells to
adhere to collagen.

the migration assay did not migrate when PDGF-BB was omitted 
from the bottom chamber (first bar). When PDGF-BB (PDGF, 20 ng/
ml) was added to the bottom chamber, rat SMC migration was ob￾served (second bar). Treatment of rat SMC with rapamycin (Rapa, 
100 ng/ml) for 48 h significantly inhibited migration (third bar, P ,
0.001). In contrast, acute administration of rapamycin (100 ng/ml) to 
the top (fourth bar) or bottom (fifth bar) chamber had no effect on 
migration. The y-axis shows the number of cells migrating onto the 
filter per high power field (see Methods for details).

anti-FKBP12 antibody directed at the carboxyl-terminus of FKBP12 
shows a 12-kD protein in rat SMC.

Rapamycin Inhibits Migration 2281
Discussion
This study demonstrates that rapamycin inhibits rat, porcine,
and human SMC migration. We have previously demonstrated
that rapamycin has antiproliferative effects on rat and human
aortic SMC mediated by binding to FKBP12 and inhibiting cell
cycle kinases and delaying phosphorylation of retinoblastoma
protein (11). The inhibitory effects of rapamycin on SMC mi￾gration are also mediated by its binding to FKBP12. Recently,
a mammalian target of the rapamycin-FKBP12 complex
(mTOR) has been identified (22, 23). While the immediate
downstream target of mTOR has not been identified, a com￾mon theme in many cell types is that rapamycin-FKBP12 in￾hibits p70 S6 kinase (24, 25), cell cycle kinases, hyperphos￾phorylation of Rb, and up-regulates the cyclin inhibitor p27 (26).
Whether the antimigratory actions of rapamycin-FKBP12 in
SMC involve any of these signaling molecules remains un￾proven. However, the present study suggests that rapamycin
can be used as a “molecular probe” to dissect signaling path￾ways regulating SMC migration in much the same way as the
drug is being used to gain insight into mechanisms controlling
cell growth.
In the present study acute administration of rapamycin had
no effect on the rat aortic SMC migration, suggesting that
longer exposure to rapamycin (. 6 h) is required. Cellular lo￾comotion required for migration is mediated by the coordi￾nated changes in the polymerization and depolymerization of
actin containing microfilaments (27, 28), although the mecha￾nism regulating these changes remain uncertain. Recently, it
has been reported that recruitment of signaling proteins in￾cluding the PDGF receptor and phospholipase C (PLC)-g and
phosphatidylinositol-3-OH (PI-39) kinase association with the
PDGF receptor triggers migration (29). Upon stimulation by
PDGF, the PDGF receptor-b autophosphorylates and forms a
complex with src homology 2-domain containing proteins such
as phosphatidylinositol-specific PLC-g, Ras-GTPase–activat￾ing protein (GAP), and PI-39 kinase (29). The association of
activated PDGF receptor-b with either PLC-g or PI-39 kinase
promotes migration, whereas association with GAP retards

that differs from the human and

Figure 5. In vivo administration of oral rapamycin inhibits SMC mi￾gratory potential. Migratory potential of SMC was examined by de￾termining the ability of cells to move out from porcine aortic tissue 
samples taken from animals treated with rapamycin compared to 
control (see Methods for experimental detail). SMC migrating out 
from the explanted tissue from both control and rapamycin (1 mg/kg 
per day)–treated animals were able to grow in culture. However, 
there was a 5-d delay in migration exhibited by SMC in the treated 
versus control animals resulting in significantly larger numbers of 
cells (Cell Number) in explant cultures from control animals. No 
SMC migration was observed in aortas from animals treated with the 
higher concentration of rapamycin (5 mg/kg), even by day 15 after ex￾plant. When the standard deviation is small no error bars are seen.

migration in response to PDGF-b (29). PLC-g and PI-39 ki￾nase have been shown to modulate actin assembly (30). Both
calcium and polyphosphoinositides have been proposed to
regulate actin formation (32). A recent study demonstrated
that activation of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein ki￾nase II (CaM kinase II) is a critical event for the migration of
SMC. Inhibiting CaM kinase II blocked migration by . 90%,
whereas the inhibition of protein kinase C activation had no
significant effect on migration (28). Although mTOR has no
apparent PI-39 kinase activity, its counterpart in yeast, TOR, is
a PI-39 kinase homologue (32).
Moreover, FKBP12 is physically associated with the type I
TGF-b receptor, suggesting that FKBP12 may have a direct
role in modulating signal transduction mediated by growth fac￾tor receptors (33). These observations suggest that one mecha￾nism whereby the rapamycin–FKBP12 complex could block
SMC migration might be via inhibition of a growth factor–
mediated pathway, possibly one that links migration to cell cy￾cle progression.
The morphology of SMC from treated and untreated cul￾tures (Fig. 1 C) and tissue sections was indistinguishable, sug￾gesting that rapamycin does not appear to have an effect on
the cytoskeletal components that have been associated with
migration. Moreover, rapamycin does not alter the ability of
SMC to bind collagen, suggesting that the antimigratory ef￾fects of the drug are not due to an inability to interact with the
extracellular matrix.
The immunosuppressant drugs rapamycin and FK506 bind
to the same site on FKBP12 (34, 35). FKBP12 also binds to
naturally occurring cellular targets (36) including three forms
of intracellular calcium release channels, calcineurin, and the
type I TGF-b receptor (16, 33, 37–40). The immunosuppres￾sant drugs mimic hydrophobic domains found in the cellular
targets of FKBP12. The presence of a serine for proline substi￾tution at residue 10 in the rat form of FKBP12 would be ex￾pected to introduce a significant structural change at the amino
terminus of the rat protein by removing a bend due to the pro￾line residue at this position that is present in the human, rabbit,
and murine forms of FKBP12. Thus, it is unlikely that the
amino-terminal domain of FKBP12 is involved in mediating
the antimigratory effects of the drug.
FKBP12 is physically associated with the skeletal muscle
and cardiac ryanodine receptors (37, 38) and the inositol
1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (39), all of which are calcium re￾lease channels located on the sarcoplasmic and endoplasmic
reticuli. FKBP12 appears to stabilize the tetrameric struc￾tures of these large ion channel complexes and modulates
channel gating (37). Moreover, both rapamycin and FK506
interfere with FKBP12’s ability to stabilize calcium release
channel structures resulting in leaky channels (37). Since the
inhibition of migration was specific for rapamycin, and not
FK506, it is unlikely that this effect involved modulation of
calcium release channels resulting in altered calcium homeo￾stasis.
Our results also demonstrate that administration of rapa￾mycin in vivo inhibits the ability of SMC to migrate. Signifi￾cantly, this inhibitory effect on migration persists for 2 wk after
exposure to rapamycin was stopped. This prolonged inhibitory
effect on SMC migration suggests that a 1-wk treatment with
oral rapamycin should reduce intimal hyperplasia, even if the
stimulus associated with a vascular intervention lasts for up to
3 wk after the procedure.
