Abstract
Background: Primary graft dysfunction (PGD) is the main cause of early morbidity and mortality after lung transplantation.
Previous studies have yielded conflicting results for PGD risk factors. Herein, we carried out a systematic review and meta￾analysis of published literature to identify recipient-related clinical risk factors associated with PGD development.
Method: A systematic search of electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane CENTRAL, and Scopus)
for studies published from 1970 to 2013 was performed. Cohort, case-control, or cross-sectional studies that examined
recipient-related risk factors of PGD were included. The odds ratios (ORs) or mean differences (MDs) were calculated using
random-effects models
Result: Thirteen studies involving 10042 recipients met final inclusion criteria. From the pooled analyses, female gender (OR
1.38, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.75), African American (OR 1.82, 95%CI 1.36 to 2.45), idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) (OR 1.78, 95%
CI 1.49 to 2.13), sarcoidosis (OR 4.25, 95% CI 1.09 to 16.52), primary pulmonary hypertension (PPH) (OR 3.73, 95%CI 2.16 to
6.46), elevated BMI (BMI$25 kg/m2
) (OR 1.83, 95% CI 1.26 to 2.64), and use of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) (OR 2.29,
95%CI 1.43 to 3.65) were significantly associated with increased risk of PGD. Age, cystic fibrosis, secondary pulmonary
hypertension (SPH), intra-operative inhaled nitric oxide (NO), or lung transplant type (single or bilateral) were not
significantly associated with PGD development (all P.0.05). Moreover, a nearly 4 fold increased risk of short-term mortality
was observed in patients with PGD (OR 3.95, 95% CI 2.80 to 5.57).
Conclusions: Our analysis identified several recipient related risk factors for development of PGD. The identification of
higher-risk recipients and further research into the underlying mechanisms may lead to selective therapies aimed at
reducing this reperfusion injury.

Introduction
Although lung transplantation has become an increasingly
common procedure in recent years, it has consistently lagged
behind other organs in survival rates [1], and early postoperative
allograft dysfunction remains a significant cause of post-transplan￾tation morbidity and mortality [2]. Primary graft dysfunction
(PGD) is a severe form of acute lung injury induced by ischemia￾reperfusion injury that occurs in approximately 10–25% of lung
graft recipients [2,3]. Reported 30-day mortality rates of patients
with severe PGD are nearly 8 times as high as those for patients
without PGD [4]. PGD leads to increased duration of mechanical
ventilation and intensive care unit stay, poor functional outcomes,
and increase rates of perioperative complications [5].
A number of previous studies have been designed to identify the
clinical risk factors associated with PGD [6–23]. This field is of
great clinical interest, since better understanding those transplant
recipients most at risk might revolve around a concept of earlier
detection for targeted therapy and aggressive support. In this
regard, a number of clinical risk factors have been identified,
including both organ donor and recipient characteristics. Donor
characteristics previously identified include female gender, African
American race, heavy smokers, older (.45 yr) or younger
(,21 yr) donor age, and closed head injury as a cause of death
[9,10,18,19,20]. Recipient characteristics previously linked to
PGD include a diagnosis of primary pulmonary hypertension
(PPH) [6,10,13,19], and elevated pulmonary artery pressures
(PAP) [6,19]. In spite of this, there are several recipient-related risk
factors that have been inconsistently reported in the literature.
Considering a single study may lack the power of providing a
reliable conclusion, we carried out a rigorous systematic review
and meta-analysis of published literature to gain more precise and
quantitative estimates of recipient-related risk factors associated
with development of PGD.

Methods
This meta-analysis followed the Meta-analysis of Observational
Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) guidelines [24].
Search Strategy
Two reviewers (YL and SJJ) systematically searched PubMed,
Embase, ISI Web of Science, Cochrane CENTRAL, and Scopus
for articles published until October 2013. The following keywords
were used in searching: ‘‘primary graft dysfunction’’ or ‘‘primary
graft failure’’ or ‘‘ischemia-reperfusion injury’’ or ‘‘acute lung
injury’’ or ‘‘early graft failure’’, combined with ‘‘lung transplan￾tation’’. Language restrictions were not applied. From the title,
abstract or descriptors, the literature search was reviewed
independently to identify potentially relevant trials for full review.
The ‘‘related articles’’ function was used to broaden the search. In
addition, a manual review of references from primary or review
articles was performed to identify any additional relevant studies.
Study selection
Cohort, case-control, and cross-sectional studies were included
if they investigated which recipient-related factors directly
influencing the development of PGD after lung transplantation.
The potential variables assessed could be recipient demographics,
co-morbidities, laboratory test, operative data, and postoperative
complications. We did not address molecular or genetic markers as
these require access to laboratory resources and genetic expertise.
After obtaining full reports of candidate studies, the same
reviewers independently assessed eligibility. Differences in data
between the two reviewers were resolved by reviewing corre￾sponding articles, and the final set was agreed on by consensus.
When multiple articles for a single study had been published, we
used the latest publication and supplemented it, if necessary, with
data from the earlier publications. Attempts were also made to
contact investigators for unpublished data.
Data Extraction
Two investigators (YL and SJJ) independently summarized the
studies meeting the inclusion criteria, and performed data
extraction using a standard data sheet [25]. Disagreement was

resolved by consensus or by a third party. For each study, the
following data were extracted: first author’s last name, publication
year, study date, country, study design, sample size, patient
characteristics (age and gender) and definition of PGD. Initially,
we scrutinized in detail the literature about PGD after lung
transplantation to identify all possible risk factors. The initial
search yielded 18 possible risk factors. Following review by an
expert panel (YL, LLS and SJJ), 10 factors that were considered to
be easily measured in routine clinical practice and had been
analyzed in at least 2 studies were selected for the full systematic
review. These factors assessed including age, gender, race,
pulmonary diagnosis, PAP, type of transplant (single lung
transplant (SLT) vs bilateral lung transplant (BLT)), body mass
index (BMI), cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), intra-operative
inhaled nitric oxide (NO), and blood products transfusion.
Study Quality Assessment
The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used to assess the quality of
observational studies based on the following nine questions: (1)
representativeness of the exposed cohort; (2) selection of the non￾exposed cohort; (3) ascertainment of exposure; (4) demonstration
that the outcome was not present at outset of study; (5)
comparability; (6) assessment of outcome; (7) length of follow-up
sufficient; (8) adequacy of participant follow-up; (9) total stars [26].
Maximum score on this scale is a total of 9. ‘‘Good’’ was defined as
a total score of 7 to 9; ‘‘fair,’’ a total score of 4–6; and ‘‘poor,’’
defined as a total score of ,4.
Statistical analyses
Our meta-analysis and statistical analyses were performed with
Revman software (version 5.2; Cochrane Collaboration, Oxford,
United Kingdom) and Stata software (version 11.0; Stata
Corporation, College Station, TX, USA). The odds ratios (ORs)

and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to estimate the
association between binary factors and development of PGD.
When mean values and SDs for a certain risk factor were
provided, we calculated the mean differences (MDs) between
patients with and without PGD. The statistical estimates of effect
were derived using a random-effects (DerSimonian and Laird)
model, which assumes that the true underlying effect varies among
included studies, because of the different characteristics of study
population, transplantation procedure, and the PGD definitions
that were involved in the original trials.
The definitions of PGD may be a potential source of
heterogeneity. In order to analyze the heterogeneity associated
with different definitions, we performed subgroup analyses by
comparing summary results obtained from subsets of studies
grouped by ‘‘the International Society for Heart and Lung
Transplantation (ISHLT) PGD Grading System [28]’’ or other
definitions. Statistical heterogeneity of treatment effects between
studies was formally tested with Cochran’s x2 statistics and with
significance set at P,0.10. The I2 statistic was used to quantify
heterogeneity. Using accepted guidelines [27], an I2 of 0% to 40%
was considered to exclude heterogeneity, an I2 of 30% to 60% to
represent moderate heterogeneity, an I2 of 50% to 90% to
represent substantial heterogeneity, and an I2 of 75% to 100% to
represent considerable heterogeneity. Publication bias was assessed
with funnel plots and the Begg’s test.
Results
Literature search and study characteristics
The method used to select studies is shown in Figure 1. A total
of 331 potentially eligible articles were initially identified, and 289
articles were excluded as they were not relevant to the purpose of
the current meta-analysis. Therefore, 42 potentially relevant
articles were selected for detailed evaluation. From the overall
pool of full-text articles, 29 articles were excluded because they did
not provide PGD data according to the risk factors we evaluated
(n = 16), reported the risk factors in an unusable format (n = 3), did
not make any objective diagnosis of PGD (n = 4), or were duplicate
studies (same cohort of patients with different endpoints measured)
(n = 6). Thus, 13 studies were included in the meta-analysis with a
total of 10042 patients [7–19]. Additional data were requested
from the authors of three studies but didn’t receive any reply.
Baseline characteristics of the studies included are shown in
Table 1. The 13 included studies consisted of 5 prospective cohort
studies [12,15–17,19], 7 retrospective analyses of cohort data or
chart review [7–11,14,18], and 1 secondary analysis of multicenter
registry [13]. Eight of the 13 studies involved American subjects
[7,9,10,13,15–17,19], and the populations of the remaining five
studies came from France [8,14], Denmark [11], Austria [12], and
Brazil [18]. The studies varied in size from 28 to 6984 subjects,
and the average age of the patients ranged from 25 to 56 years.
There were some variations in the definition of PGD. The
ISHLT PGD grading schema was used in the majority of the
studies. The other 5 studies also defined PGD based on the
presence of infiltrates in the lung allograft on chest radiograph
and/or the PaO2/FiO2 ratio [7–9,11,13]. PGD, as defined in the
original articles, was present in 16.4% of the lung transplant
patients. All studies were of high methodological quality (good or
fair) as assessed by the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale [26] (Table 1). The
risk factors examined in the 13 included studies are summarized in
Table 2.
Outcomes and synthesis of results
Age. Ten studies investigated the influence of recipient age on
the occurrence of PGD [7–9,11,12,14–18], including 434 patients
with PGD and 969 controls. Findings from this analysis suggested
no significant difference in mean age between patients with or
without PGD (MD -0.75 y, 95% CI -2.12 to 0.63 y, P = 0.29).
Statistical heterogeneity among the studies was significant
(I2= 61%, P = 0.006).
Gender. Twelve studies investigated the influence of recipient
gender on the occurrence of PGD [8–19]. These studies included
1506 patients with PGD and 8430 controls. The proportion of

female recipients was 55.3% in patients with PGD compared with
49.0% in patients without. Analysis suggested female recipients
had an increased risk of PGD (OR 1.38, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.75,
P = 0.008) (Figure 2).
Race. Five studies reported the influence of recipient race
[9,13,15,17,19]. PGD was found in 11.4% of patients with white
race, 19.1% of African American patients, and 18.7% of Hispanic
patients. White race was used as the reference group given the
lowest incidence of PGD. Analysis of these studies showed
compared with white race, African American was associated with
a significantly increased risk of PGD (OR 1.82, 95%CI 1.36 to
2.45, P,0.0001), while Hispanic race did not appear to affect the
risk of PGD (OR 1.04, 95%CI 0.32 to 3.42, P = 0.94) (Figure 3).
Pulmonary Diagnosis. The effect of recipient pulmonary
diagnosis on PGD development was evaluated in 10 studies [7–
13,16,17,19]. The incidence of PGD was 11.8% in patients with
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), 18.0% in patients
with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), 50% in sarcoidosis and
12.4% in cystic fibrosis. For patients with pulmonary hypertension,
PGD was observed in 30.3% of patients with PPH and 29.3% of
secondary pulmonary hypertension (SPH).
Using COPD as the reference group (with the lowest incidence
of PGD), IPF (OR 1.78, 95% CI 1.49 to 2.13, P,0.0001) [7–
13,16,17,19] and sarcoidosis (OR 4.25, 95% CI 1.09 to 16.52,
P = 0.04) [7,16–17] were both associated with increased risk of
PGD; while cystic fibrosis was non-significantly associated with
PGD development (OR 1.28, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.84, P = 0.18) [8–
10,12,13,16,17,19] (Figure 4). PPH was also significantly associ￾ated with PGD, with a 3.73-fold increased risk of PGD was
observed (OR 3.73, 95%CI 2.16 to 6.46, P,0.001) [7–
10,12,13,16–17]; while unlike PPH, SPH did not confer an
significantly increased risk of PGD (OR 2.23, 95%CI 0.65 to 7.69,
P = 0.20) [10,13] (Figure 5).
PAP. There were 7 studies compared the mean PAP between
patients with and without PGD (325 PGD patients and 1093
controls) [7,9,12,15–17,19]. Findings from the meta-analysis
showed a significant higher PAP was observed in the PGD
patients as compared with the controls (MD 6.00 mmHg, 95% CI
3.91 to 8.09 mmHg, P,0.0001). Statistical heterogeneity was
observed among the studies (I2= 77%, P = 0.0003) (Figure 6).
BLT vs. SLT. Eleven studies evaluated the impact of BLT vs.
SLT on PGD development, including 4554 patients undergoing
Figure 4. The influence of recipient pulmonary diagnosis on PGD. COPD was used as the reference group.

BLT and 5190 patients undergoing SLT [7–10,12,13,15–19]. The
pooled analysis showed the incidence of PGD was 14.5% in BLT
recipients, compared to 13.8% in SLT recipients. Findings from
the meta-analysis showed an insignificant association between the
transplant type (SLT or BLT) and PGD (OR 1.10, 95% CI 0.97 to
1.24, P = 0.14). No statistically significant heterogeneity was
observed between studies (I2= 0%, P = 0.65).
BMI. Two studies evaluated the effect of BMI (as a
continuous variable) on PGD [11,14], including 155 patients with
PGD and 147 controls. The pooled analysis of the 2 studies
showed patients with PGD had a higher mean BMI level than
controls (MD 1.20 kg/m2
, 95% CI 0.13 to 2.27 kg/m2
, P = 0.03).
Other 2 studies investigated the impact of elevated BMI
(BMI$25 kg/m2
) on PGD development [13,19]. The incidence
of PGD was 15.2% in the 3105 patients with elevated BMI,
compared to 9.4% in the 5091 patients with normal BMI. Analysis
of these studies showed a significant association between elevated
BMI level and PGD (OR 1.83, 95% CI 1.26 to 2.64, P = 0.001).
CPB. Eleven studies evaluated the effect of CPB for PGD
[7,8,10–12,14–19]. PGD was found in 263 of 813 patients (32.3%)
use of CPB compared to 490 of 1984 patients (24.7%) without
CPB. The pooled analysis of these studies showed a 2.29-fold
increased risk of PGD was present for patients requiring CPB (OR
2.29, 95%CI 1.43 to 3.65, P = 0.0005), with statistical heteroge￾neity among the studies (I2= 69%, P = 0.0004).
Inhaled NO. Four studies investigated the influence of intra￾operative use of inhaled NO on the occurrence of PGD [9,14–16].
The incidence of PGD was 23.4% (50 of 214 patients) and 18.8%
(59 of 314 patients) in patients with and without use of inhaled
NO, respectively. Findings from this analysis suggested there was
no significant association between intra-operative inhaled NO use
and development of PGD (OR 1.09, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.74,

P = 0.72). No statistical heterogeneity was observed between
studies (I2= 0%, P = 0.95).
Blood products transfusion. Three studies reported the
amount of packed red blood cells (RBCs) and plasma used during
the lung transplant procedure to evaluate the effect of intra￾operative transfusion on PGD [14,15,19]. Findings from the meta￾analysis showed a greater amount of packed RBCs and plasma
transfused in patients with PGD compared with those without
(RBCs: MD 341 ml, 95% CI 254 to 427 ml, P,0.001; plasma:
MD 131 ml, 95% CI 71 to 191 ml, P,0.001). The x2 test for
heterogeneities were also non-significant (I2= 0%, P = 0.84 and
I
2= 44%, P = 0.17).
Mortality risk for PGD. The impact of PGD on mortality
(within 90 days) was reported in 8 studies [7,8,10–12,16,18,19].
All-cause mortality within 90 days was 22.8% for patients with
PGD versus 7.1% for patients without. The pooled analysis
suggested patients with PGD was associated with a nearly 4 fold
increased risk of short-term mortality (OR 3.95, 95% CI 2.80 to
5.57, P,0.001) compared with those without PGD. There was no
statistical heterogeneity among the studies (I2= 19%, P = 0.28)
(Figure 7).
Subgroup analysis according to the definitions for
PGD. In the subgroup meta-analysis, we compared the associ￾ations between above risk factors and PGD in subsets of studies
grouped by ISHLT PGD grade or other definitions (Table 3). The
results showed no matter which definition was used in the original
studies, no significant difference was observed in the effects of age,
gender, race, pulmonary diagnosis, mPAP, BLT vs SLT, use of
CPB, or inhaled NO in PGD development (P for subgroup
difference .0.05).
Publication Bias
We performed funnel plot analysis and Begg’s test to assess
publication bias. Funnel plot analysis was performed using the
recipient gender as an index, the funnel plot of the 12 studies
appeared to be symmetrical (Figure 8), and the Begg’s test of
funnel plot suggested no publication bias (P = 0.87). Also no
publication bias was detected by Begg’s test for other outcomes
analysis (all P.0.05).
Discussion
Despite the significant morbidity and mortality in patients with
PGD after lung transplantation, the recipient related risk factors
contributing to this devastating syndrome remain controversial.
Our meta-analysis comprehensively reviewed 13 studies involving
10042 lung transplantation recipients which addressed the clinical
risk factors for PGD. The results showed recipient female gender,
African American race, preoperative diagnosis of IPF, sarcoidosis,
or PPH, elevated mean PAP and BMI, use of CPB and blood
products transfusion were significantly and consistently associated
with development of PGD. All of these factors are likely to be
measured and monitored in the primary care setting. To the best
of our knowledge, this is the first systematic review on this topic.
Among baseline variables, we have demonstrated that female
gender and African-American race had increased risk of PGD,
which have not been validated in previous studies. Female gender
has been associated with a higher risk of development of acute
respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in the Ibuprofen in Sepsis
Study Group [29], as well as in a cohort study of trauma patients
[30]. Similarly, donor female gender was also shown to have an
independent impact on PGD [9]. Possible mechanisms for these
findings are unclear. Some theories for the differential outcome
based on gender differences have been advocated, including
immunity and tolerance theories [31] and the influence of gender
hormones [32]. However, as of now few data have been published
that evaluate the effect of gender on graft function and survival.
Similarly, mechanisms for the observed worse outcome of African￾American race remain speculative, but may reflect differences in
vascular endothelium (such as expression of angiotensin-convert￾ing enzyme) [33,34], which could potentially predispose African
Americans to more severe ischemia reperfusion injury.
Elevated BMI was another risk factor for PGD in our meta￾analysis. Prior studies have identified obesity as a risk factor for
early mortality and increased intensive care unit stay after lung
transplant [35,36]. Technical difficulties of performing a lung
transplant operation in obese recipients may increase risk of PGD.
Other possible explanations may be obesity affects the milieu of
cytokines produced by adipose tissue during ischemia-reperfusion,
such as leptin [37], which has been shown to be increased in
patients with acute lung injury and play a role in the development
of acute lung injury in animal model [38]. In the study by Lederer
et al, higher plasma leptin levels were associated with PGD after
lung transplantation [39]. In addition, modulation of lung
inflammation by other adipokines, such as resistin, adiponectin,
which produced by macrophages recruited to hypertrophic and
hypoxic adipose tissue, could also be responsible [39–41]. Future
studies of adipokines in lung tissue or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid
and examination of their roles in the development of PGD should
be pursued.

Recipient-Related Risk Factor for PGD
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 8 March 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 3 | e92773

In nearly all previous studies, diagnosis of PPH was the most
significant risk factor for PGD [6,10,13,19], and our findings
further support this, showing both PPH and elevated mPAP were
strongly associated with PGD after lung transplant. Possible
explanations are not fully understood. In PPH, right ventricular
dysfunction is universally present, and the hypertrophied, failing
right ventricle is acutely afterload reduced at transplantation,
resulting in increased shear stress on the formerly hypoxic
pulmonary vascular endothelium. Shear stress leads to capillary
leak and worse graft function [42,43]. Christie et al showed
diagnosis of PPH was even more strongly associated with an
increased risk of PGD after adjustment for recipient PAP (adjusted
RR = 9.24, P = 0.009) [9]. This implies it is the disease state of
PPH that increases the risk, rather than just the presence or
severity of pulmonary hypertension. Unlike PPH, our study
suggested SPH did not confer an increased risk of PGD. In prior
studies, the association between SPH and PGD was controversial
and the conclusions were inconsistent [10,13,15,18]. Fang et al
demonstrated SPH in patients with IPF was independently
associated with the development of PGD [15]. While for patients
with CF, based on data from the ISHLT registry, no significant
difference was observed in PGD incidence for patients with and
without pulmonary hypertension [6]. These findings suggested
that the association between pulmonary hypertension and PGD
might depend on the underlying diagnoses to some extent. For
studies included in this meta-analysis, SPH has been all-inclusive,
regardless of cause [10,13,18]. Therefore, for further discussion, it
is better to focus on the primary disease of SPH.
IPF was also identified as a risk factor with intermediate risk of
PGD in our analysis. Previous observational studies reported
patients undergoing transplantation for IPF had somewhat worse
survival than for other indications, when matched on multiple

variables [44,45]. Possible explanations may be related to the
pathogenesis of IPF. IPF carries a progressive course of pulmonary
dysfunction that is inhibited, but not eliminated, by transplanta￾tion. Vasoactive mediators such as endothelin-1, platelet-derived
growth factor, transforming growth factor-b, and fibroblast growth
factor have all been implicated in the pathogenesis of IPF, and also
contribute to the development of lung injury [46]. Moreover, IPF
patients have a restrictive pattern of pulmonary disease with
smaller-than-predicted total lung capacity. Shrinking lung volume
may have caused irreversible damage to pulmonary mechanics by
contracting the chest wall (remodeling). This relative ‘‘oversize’’
donor lung within smaller chest may lead to worse graft function
[45,47]. Nevertheless, at this point, reasons for the poor outcomes
of IPF after transplantation remain elusive and warrant focused
investigation.
The intra-operative use of CPB was another potential contrib￾utor to PGD in our meta-analysis. CPB causes a systemic, pro￾inflammatory response with activation of cytokines, leukocytes and
the complement cascade [48,49]. Patients requiring CPB have
been shown to have more radiographic infiltrates, worse imme￾diate graft function, longer intubation, and ultimately, decreased
survival [50,51]. However, a notable difficulty in interpreting the
data is the overall severity of the patient’s illness or operative
difficulty requiring the use of CPB. It is not possible to accurately
differentiate planned use of CPB from emergent initiation intra￾operatively because of deterioration in patient hemodynamics or
oxygenation. As a result, independent of indication for CPB use,
the association between PGD and CPB is still debatable. The type
of transplant procedure (bilateral vs. single) was not identified as a
significant risk factor for PGD in our study. Although the reported
incidence of PGD was somewhat higher in BLT recipients, higher
pre-transplant PAP and CPB use in BLT recipients likely
confounded these results [5,10].
The finding of blood products transfusion as a risk factor for
PGD has been shown in recent multicenter studies and our meta￾analysis confirmed this tendency [19,52], but the exact relation￾ship between the two processes is not yet clear. Blood products
transfusion in-and-of-itself is associated with transfusion-related
lung injury, which results in an ARDS-like picture similar to that
seen with PGD [53]. The transfusion-related lung injury might
accentuate any underlying mild ischemia/reperfusion injury,
resulting in the onset of clinically significant PGD [53].
Nonetheless, the need for blood products administration has been
shown to collinear with other PGD risk factors, including PPH and
the use of CPB, and unmeasured operative characteristics may
also lead to transfusion requirements [54]. Therefore dissecting the
independence of the relationship between blood transfusion and
PGD is difficult.
Inhaled NO has been investigated as a potential agent for the
prevention of PGD, given its effects on pulmonary vasodilation
and capillary integrity. Although our analysis did not support use
of inhaled NO to be effective in PGD prevention, it may be
beneficial in clinical settings of established PGD. Several reports
and case series have shown improved outcomes with inhaled NO
administration [55,56]. However, there have also been studies that
do not show efficacy in the setting of PGD [57]. Lack of
randomized clinical trials showing survival benefit precludes
widespread recommendation of inhaled NO for the treatment of
PGD. Again, extrapolating from inhaled NO use in studies with
ARDS, the beneficial effects of inhaled NO may be real, but also
appear to be transient [58].
Limitations of the review
Although we believe that the current meta-analysis provided
useful information, some potential limitations should be addressed.
Firstly, heterogeneity in our study is substantial and may be
attributed to differences in type of patients, study era, operative
practice, and definition of PGD. Definition of PGD is a major
cause of heterogeneity, and with potential for misclassification
bias. As the ISHLT PGD criteria were first published in 2005,
studies performed before 2005 did not use standard defining
criteria; even for the studies defined PGD based on the ISHLT
guidelines, the PGD grades were retrospectively assigned to those
patients enrolled before 2005. To clarify the heterogeneity,
subgroup analyses were performed by dividing studies according
to ISHLT or other definitions, and the results suggested our
Figure 8. Funnel plot of the 12 studies evaluated the effect of the recipient gender on PGD.

findings were not significantly affected by varying definitions.
Secondly, our analysis was by necessity restricted to individual risk
factors. Therefore, the distinct possibility exists that the strength of
association may be weaker with a multi-factorial regression
analysis; for instance, the individual effects of CPB, use of blood
products, and elevated PAP cannot be delineated since they are
often apparent in the same patients. In the present meta-analysis,
it was not possible to adjust or stratify for potential confounders,
which restricted us doing more detailed relevant analysis and
obtaining more comprehensive results. Finally, given that a
proportion of studies included are retrospective, a possibility of
residual confounding variables by unmeasured factors cannot be
eliminated. This provided associative, not causal, evidence and
mandates caution when interpreting these results.
Conclusion
Our systematic review and meta-analysis have identified several
recipient-related risk factors for development of PGD, all of which
are readily available in clinical settings. The identification of
higher-risk recipients has great clinical relevance with respect to
individual screening, risk factor modification, selective manage￾ment aimed at prevention of PGD, and ultimately improves the
outcomes of patients undergoing lung transplantation. Further
research into the underlying mechanisms responsible for these
associations should be advocated.
