Mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS) are inherited, severe, progressive, metabolic disorders caused by
deficiencies in different enzymes involved in degradation of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). Although
enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) has recently been available for MPS type I, and clinical trials have been
performed in ERT for MPS II and MPS VI, there is little chance that this kind of treatment may be effective
for neurodegenerative forms of MPS (due to inefficient delivery of enzymes to central nervous system
through the blood–brain barrier), hence currently there is no effective therapy available for them.
Therefore, we aim to develop an alternative therapy for these diseases. We found that genistein (40
,5,
7-trihydroxyisoflavone or 5,7-dihydroxy-3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one) inhibits synthesis
of GAGs considerably in cultures of fibroblasts of MPS patients (types I, II, IIIA and IIIB were tested).
Prolonged cultivation of these cells in the presence of genistein resulted in reduction of GAG accumulation
and normalization of cells as estimated by biochemical tests and electron microscopic analysis,
respectively. As genistein inhibits kinase activity of epidermal growth factor receptor, which is required for
full expression of genes coding for enzymes involved in GAG production, we propose to consider a
substrate reduction therapy for MPS, which is referred to as ‘gene expression-targeted isoflavone therapy’.

Introduction
Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs, formerly called mucopoly￾saccharides) are compounds synthesized in most tissues of
human body and playing important roles in fundamental
biological processes, mostly by binding to variety of
proteins.1 Proper turnover of GAGs is ensured by degrada￾tion of their excess in lysosomes, which is mediated by
specific acid hydrolases. Deficiency in an activity of one of
these enzymes leads to accumulation of GAGs in lysosomes
of virtually every cell of the body as well as outside of cells.
Affected tissues do not perform properly, which leads to
progressive damage throughout the body, including the
heart, respiratory system, bones, joints and, in some cases,
central nervous system. The diseases caused by accumula￾tion of GAGs are called mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS).2 In

fact, degradation of GAGs (mainly heparan sulphate,
dermatan sulphate and keratan sulphate) requires actions
of several enzymes, and deficiency in one of them causes
particular MPS type, characterized by specific clinical
features. MPS are genetic, metabolic diseases inherited in
an autosomal recessive manner (except MPS II, which is
X-linked).2 In most cases the disease is fatal, with expected
lifespan between one and two decades on average, how￾ever, prediction of its severity and clinical progress is
usually difficult, even when biochemical and genetic data
are available.3
Until recently, no effective treatment was available for
any MPS type. Since a few years, enzyme replacement
therapy (ERT, based on intravenous injection of an active
form of recombinant enzyme whose deficiency causes the
disease) can be used for treatment of MPS I,4–6 and it
appears that analogous therapy should be generally
available relatively soon for two other MPS types.7,8 This
therapy is effective in treatment of somatic symptoms of
MPS I, MPS II and MPS VI; however, when heparan
sulphate cannot be degraded, severe neurological problems
may occur, which cannot be managed by ERT owing to
inefficient delivery of proteins, including those used as
drugs, to central nervous system, because of the blood –
brain barrier. This is the case in some MPS I patients
(subtype MPS IH), most of MPS II and MPS VII patients and
all MPS III patients (all subtypes, ie IIIA, IIIB, IIIC and
IIID).2 Sanfilippo disease (MPS III) seems to be especially
problematic as this condition is associated with severe
learning difficulty and behavioural disturbance and only
relatively mild somatic involvement. In most affected
patients, the progressive nature of the disease leads to
death in the second, or rarely third decade of life.2 As the
disorder primarily affects the brain and nervous system,
attempts to cure the disorder have not been possible and
the best that can be offered is palliative or symptomatic
care.
Apart from provision of the deficient enzyme, another
possible strategy for treatment of lysosomal storage
disorders (including MPS) is reduction of the substrate
whose degradation is impaired.9 For such a substrate
reduction therapy (SRT), an analogue of a monomer that
is incorporated into a complex macromolecule is usually
considered. It may be a competitor of the natural substrate
for an enzyme synthesizing the macromolecule. However,
in the process leading to synthesis of GAGs, the monomers
are carbohydrates or their derivatives that are also involved
in many other metabolic pathways.10 Therefore, a putative
competitor that could block activity of one of enzymes
taking part in GAG synthesis, would most probably
interfere with many other metabolic pathways, by blocking
other biochemical reactions, thus giving potentially serious
side effects. Therefore, to avoid this problem we aimed to
develop SRT based on regulation of expression of genes
coding for specific GAG synthetases.
Materials and methods
Culture media and reagents
Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM), minimum
essential medium (MEM), fetal bovine serum (FBS),
antibiotic antimycotic solution (AAS), Dulbecco’s phosphate￾buffered saline (PBS), L-glutamine, 0.25% trypsinFethy￾lene diaminetetraacetic acid solution, dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO) and Proteinase K were from Sigma. Genistein was
synthesized at the Pharmaceutical Research Institute,
Warsaw and kindly provided by Grzegorz Grynkiewicz
(Pharmaceutical Institute, Warsaw). Na2[
35S]O4 was pur￾chased from Amersham. PicoGreens ds DNA Quantitation
Reagent was obtained from Molecular Probes. Blyscant
(Sulfated Glycosaminoglycan Assay) was from Biocolor Ltd.
Recombinant human a-L-iduronidase (Aldurazymes, laro￾nidase) was obtained from Genzyme.
Cell lines and cultivation conditions
Skin fibroblast lines were initiated from forearm skin
biopsies obtained from healthy volunteers and MPS
patients, diagnosed on the basis of standard biochemical
and enzymatic assays for levels of urinary GAGs and
activity of lysosomal hydrolases, respectively. Fibroblasts
of MPS I, MPS II, MPS IIIA and MPS IIIB patients were
used. The MPS I patient was found (on the basis of DNA
sequencing) to be homozygous for the Q70X mutation, a
commonly found mutation in this disease. Cells were
routinely grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% heat￾inactivated FBS and 1  AAS at 371C in a humidified
atmosphere of 5% (v/v) CO2.
Estimation of effects of genistein on GAG synthesis
Genistein was dissolved in DMSO and added to indicated
final concentrations to cell cultures grown in DMEM (final
DMSO concentration was 0.05%).11 Cells were preincu￾bated in 25 cm2 flasks for 72 h in DMEM supplemented
with appropriate amounts of genistein or 0.05% DMSO
(control cultures). Then, the cells were plated in 24-well
plates and allowed to attach to the wells for 24 h. GAG
synthesis was monitored by measurement of incorporation
of 35S into proteoglycans, as described previously.12 Briefly,
cells were labeled with either 20 or 40 mCi/ml of Na2[
35S]O4
for 24 or 48 h in a growth medium lacking inorganic
sulfate (MEM), supplemented with 1% FBS and 1  AAS with
appropriate genistein concentrations sustained. Fibroblasts
were washed twice with PBS and cultures were subjected to
papain digestion (0.03% papain in 0.1 M sodium acetate,
pH 7.0).13 Aliquots of papain digest were used for 35S
incorporation measurements in a scintillation counter.
In all experiments, unlabeled control samples were processed
in parallel for the determination of cell numbers. At the
end of each experiment, cells were trypsinized and
quantitated using a Thoma counter. For DNA quantitation,
fibroblasts were subjected to proteinase digestion, then
diluted (12 –175 times depending on the intensity of the

response to PicoGreen dye) and analyzed according to the
protocol provided by the manufacturer of PicoGreens ds
DNA Quantitation Reagent. GAGs synthesis was calculated
per cell or per DNA amount.
Measurement of GAG levels in cells
Fibroblasts were plated at 24-well plates and grown in
DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1  AAS with
indicated concentrations of genistein or 0.05% DMSO
(control cultures). Samples of cultures were withdrawn at
indicated times, cells were washed with PBS and trypsi￾nized (80 ml/well). DMEM with 10% FBS and 1  AAS
(400 ml/well) was used to inactivate trypsin and this
solution was transferred to 1.5 ml Eppendorf tubes and
centrifuged at 2000 r.p.m. in a microcentrifuge for 2 min.
Following removal of supernatant, the cells were digested
with proteinase K (50 mg/ml in 100 mM K2HPO4 pH 8.0;
400 ml/tube) at 561C overnight, as described previously.14
Then, proteinase K was inactivated at 901C for 10 min. The
prepared samples were stored at 201C until used for
sulfated GAG quantification with Blyscan Assay, and DNA
measurement with PicoGreens Quantitation Reagent,
according to the manufacturer’s instructions . Levels of
GAGs were expressed per DNA amount.
Electron microscopic analysis
Aclar rectangles (0.5  1.0 cm) were put into some of the
wells prepared for the GAG quantitation experiment,
removed between PBS wash and trypsinization and placed
in fresh plates with fresh PBS in order to serve for
microscopic examination. Transmission electron micro￾scopy studies were performed as described previously,15
using a Philips CM100 microscope.
Results
It was demonstrated previously that maximum synthesis of
at least some GAGs, including heparan sulphate and
dermatan sulphate, requires either follicle-stimulating
hormone or epidermal growth factor (EGF).16,17 The EGF
influences expression of certain genes by binding to its
transmembrane receptor, which upon interaction with EGF
becomes an active protein kinase, initiating a specific
kinase cascade that finally results in regulation of activity
of particular transcription factors. An independent re￾search line led to discovery that tyrosine-specific protein
kinase activity of the EGF receptor is inhibited by genistein
(40
, 5, 7-trihydroxyisoflavone or 5, 7-dihydroxy-3-(4-
hydroxyphenyl)-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one).18,19 Thus, we as￾sumed that genistein may inhibit synthesis of GAGs owing
to impairment of expression of genes coding for one or
more of enzymes involved in this process. Some data
obtained by others in experiments on cancer cells could
suggest that this might be the case;20 – 22 however, various
cell lines gave different results, perhaps due to severe
genetic changes in these cells.
We have treated cultures of fibroblasts of either a healthy
person or MPS patients with various amounts of genistein
and estimated synthesis of GAGs by measurement of
radioactive [35S]O4
2 uptake. Such a procedure was ade￾quate as in mammalian cells, SO4
2 is incorporated almost
exclusively into GAGs.23 We found that genistein inhibited
GAG synthesis significantly in both wild-type and MPS
cells (Figure 1). The most effective inhibition was observed
at concentrations of genistein about 10 – 30 mM, and further
increase in concentration of this isoflavone did not cause
more pronounced effects (Figure 1 and data not shown).
Knowing that genistein can impair GAG synthesis, we
asked about effects of this isoflavone on accumulation of
these compounds in cells. Thus, quantification of un￾labeled GAGs with Blyscan Assay was performed (see
Materials and methods for details). Fibroblasts of a healthy
person and of patients suffering from various MPS types
were cultured for 6 days in the absence of genistein or in
the presence of this compound at concentration giving
optimal inhibition of GAG synthesis. At indicated times,
GAG levels were estimated in cell samples. As a positive

of GAGs in fibroblasts of the MPS I patient. Cells were cultured in the
presence of Na2[
35S]O4 as described in Materials and methods for
48 h, radioactivity of incorporated 35S was measured in a scintillation
counter and calculated per DNA amount. 100% corresponds to
33.2 dpm/ng DNA and other presented values reflect this value.
Similar results were obtained when cells were cultured for 24 h in the
presence of Na2[
35S]O4 and when the radioactivity was calculated per
cell number (data not shown). Moreover, similar results were obtained
when fibroblasts from either a healthy person or other MPS types (MPS
II, MPS IIIA and MPS IIIB) were analysed (data not shown). Further
increase in genistein concentration (up to 0.1 mM) did not result in
more efficient inhibition of GAG synthesis than that observed at 30 mM
(data not shown). The results presented are average values from three
measurements with bars indicating standard deviation.

control, we used MPS I cells treated with recombinant
human a-L-iduronidase (laronidase, Aldurazyme), an en￾zyme used in ERT for MPS I. In all cases (MPS I, MPS II, MPS
IIIA and MPS IIIB), addition of genistein to cell cultures
resulted in significant reduction of GAG storage (Figure 2).
Interestingly, in MPS I fibroblasts, the effect of genistein
after prolonged incubation (from 2 to 6 days) was
comparable to that observed for Aldurazyme.
Various abnormal structures (onion skin structures, zebra
bodies, flocculent inclusions and complex vacuoles with
inclusions) are frequently found during electron micro￾scopic analysis of cells of patients suffering from MPS.2
According to this, abundant abnormal structures were
observed in untreated MPS I fibroblasts (grown in cell
cultures) in electron microscopic analysis (Figure 3b). As
expected, addition of Aldurazyme into the MPS I cell
culture caused a significant decrease in size and number of
such structures in cells (Figure 3c), which became more
similar to fibroblasts of a healthy person (Figure 3a).
However, similar normalization was also observed in MPS
I cells treated with genistein (Figure 3d). The changes were
both qualitative (Figure 3) and quantitative, as estimated
by counting of abnormal structures in cells and calculating
them per 10 mm2 of cell cross-section (Table 1).
In all our cell culture experiments we were not able to
observe any changes in cell integrity and proliferation in
the presence of genistein (at concentrations up to 30 mM)
relative to untreated cultures (data not shown). This
applied to wild-type cells and all cell lines derived from
MPS patients.
Discussion
As MPS, a group of genetic, metabolic diseases caused by
defects in degradation of GAGs, are fatal disorders, for
which no treatment is currently available or should be
available soon, except type VI and non-neurodegenerative
forms of types I and II, development of new potential
therapeutic strategies appears to be of high importance.
Treatment of neurodegenerative forms of MPS, which are
predominant, is not possible now, even though ERT can be
available, owing to the problem with crossing the blood –
brain barrier by enzymes. The use of small molecules,
which could modulate GAG metabolism, might potentially
overcome this difficulty. Moreover, efficiency of correction
of various somatic tissues and organs of MPS patients
during ERT may vary considerably,6 thus further improve￾ment of GAG turnover in these patients is still desired.
Our studies demonstrated that treatment with genistein,
which causes impairment of GAG synthesis, may be an
effective method for reduction of GAG storage in cells of
MPS patients, certainly MPS I, MPS II, MPS IIIA and MPS
IIIB, and normalization of these cells. One might predict
that inhibition of GAG synthesis can only halt further
accumulation of these compounds in MPS cells rather than
cause a decrease in their levels in cells. Contrary to such a
prediction, we observed a clear reduction in GAG storage in
affected cells. This may be caused by either degradation of
accumulated GAGs by residual activity of the deficient
enzyme, which could be the case if GAG synthesis rate was
lower than the rate of their degradation, or dilution of
GAGs in fibroblasts as cells divide, which would be the case
if GAG synthesis was too slow to ensure doubling of GAG
amount before each cell division, or both. Interestingly,
reduction in GAG storage and normalization of cells were
observed in fibroblasts of an MPS I patient who is
homozygous for Q70X mutation, causing no detectable
residual activity of a-L-iduronidase – an enzyme deficient in
MPS I.

obtained for untreated wild-type fibroblasts (see column Ctrl in panel a
for time 0) were subtracted from the values measured for each sample,
and such calculated values are presented (no significant effects of
either genistein or Aldurazyme on GAG levels was observed in wild￾type fibroblasts, ie at times 0, 2 and 6 days all measured values were
around 60 ng GAG per 1 ng DNA; thus, in the case of control
experiments, all values in a putative subpanel Ctrl in panel b would be
around 0). Average results from three measurements are shown; in
each case s.d. was below 20%.

Importantly, in both wild-type (control) cells and MPS
fibroblasts, treatment with genistein did not cause reduc￾tion of GAG levels to the amount significantly lower than
that measured in untreated wild-type cells, considered to
be a normal level (Figure 2 and data not shown). This
indicates that such a treatment, despite causing significant
reduction in GAG synthesis rate, ensures maintenance of
sufficient amounts of GAG, which is necessary for proper
functions of cells and tissues. One may assume that this is
due to a putative feedback regulation, which senses GAG
levels and responds to changes in the rate of synthesis of
these compounds, and directs for degradation only an
excess of GAGs.
On the basis of results presented in this report, we
propose to consider the use of genistein as a potential
method for treatment of MPS. Results presented in this
paper may serve as proof-of-principle of this novel
therapeutic approach at a cellular level. Because of the
suggested mechanism of action of genistein (an isofla￾vone), we propose to call this type of treatment ‘gene
expression-targeted isoflavone therapy’ (GET IT). Although
ERT may be potentially more efficient in treatment of at
least some somatic tissues of MPS patients,6,24,25 an
advantage of GET IT is that genistein is able to cross the
blood –brain barrier.26 Therefore, this might be a chance
for treatment of neurological symptoms of MPS, which is
currently not possible. Although intrathecal administra￾tion of Aldurazyme was shown to reduce lysosomal storage
in the brain and meninges of the canine model of MPS I,27
this technique may be problematic in the case of
hyperactive children in which every anesthetic procedures
are dangerous, like in MPS II and MPS III patients.2 It was

demonstrated recently that using very high doses of
recombinant human b-glucuronidase, it is possible to
deliver small amounts of the enzyme to brains of MPS VII
mice;28 however, it is not clear whether this partial
overcoming of the blood – brain barrier might be sufficient
to cause significant therapeutic effects in mice. Even if so,
one might easily imagine various problems (both medical
and economical) with provision of very high amounts of
the enzyme to human patients suffering from MPS VII and
other MPS types. GET IT, apart from being a potential
method for treatment of neurological symptoms of MPS,
would also be an option for any MPS patients who are
unable or unwilling to receive ERT. In fact, one might also
suppose that combination of GET IT with ERT (and/or
another therapeutic procedure) could be an optimal
method for treatment of MPS.
It is obvious that further in vitro and in vivo studies,
including clinical trials, are necessary before GET IT can be
considered a real treatment for MPS patients. A crucial issue
that should be discussed is a possibility of potential side
effects of such a treatment. As genistein is an inhibitor of
protein kinase activity of the EGF receptor,18,19 which is
involved in many signal transduction processes, one might
be afraid that some essential regulatory pathways could be
influenced. On the other hand, at concentrations studied
in this work, genistein is not able to block the EGF receptor
activity completely. In fact, although impairment of
proliferation of cancer cells was observed at relatively high
concentrations of genistein,11,22 we did not observe any
significant changes in cell integrity and proliferation in
wild-type and MPS fibroblasts treated with 10 –30 mM
genistein. Thus, the effect of high concentrations of
genistein on proliferation of cancer cells might be a partial
explanation of various effects of this compound observed
in different cancer cell lines reported previously,20 – 22 but
serious side effects of moderate doses of genistein mediated
by inhibition of EGF receptor kinase activity seem to be
unlikely. Such a prediction is supported by results of
studies, in which administration of genistein was demon￾strated to be well tolerated and safe for animals and
humans, even at doses several folds higher than those
employed in our experiments.29 – 33
Other putative side effects of genistein could be caused
by its phytoestrogenic activity.34 This might concern
mainly children, owing to a potential influence on puberty
and fertility. In fact, decreased fertility in males was
reported as the only significant side effect in studies on
the use of genistein or soy isoflavones as potential drugs
and nutritional supplements for humans and animals.29 – 36
However, if genistein were effective in alleviation of MPS
symptoms, the benefits for patients would be significantly
more important than such a side effect. Although muta￾genic or genotoxic activities of genistein have been
reported in cell culture and animal studies, these effects
were observed only at very high concentrations or doses of
this isoflavone,37 thus, corresponding side effects during a
potential treatment of MPS patients are unlikely.
