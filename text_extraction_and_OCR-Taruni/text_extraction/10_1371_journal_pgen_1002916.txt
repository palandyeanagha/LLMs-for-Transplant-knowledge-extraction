Abstract
Complement C3 and C4 play key roles in the main physiological activities of complement system, and their deficiencies or
over-expression are associated with many clinical infectious or immunity diseases. A two-stage genome-wide association
study (GWAS) was performed for serum levels of C3 and C4. The first stage was conducted in 1,999 healthy Chinese men,
and the second stage was performed in an additional 1,496 subjects. We identified two SNPs, rs3753394 in CFH gene and
rs3745567 in C3 gene, that are significantly associated with serum C3 levels at a genome-wide significance level
(P = 7.33610211 and P = 1.8361029
, respectively). For C4, one large genomic region on chromosome 6p21.3 is significantly
associated with serum C4 levels. Two SNPs (rs1052693 and rs11575839) were located in the MHC class I area that include
HLA-A, HLA-C, and HLA-B genes. Two SNPs (rs2075799 and rs2857009) were located 59 and 39 of C4 gene. The other four
SNPs, rs2071278, rs3763317, rs9276606, and rs241428, were located in the MHC class II region that includes HLA-DRA, HLA￾DRB, and HLA-DQB genes. The combined P-values for those eight SNPs ranged from 3.19610222 to 5.62610297. HBsAg￾positive subjects have significantly lower C3 and C4 protein concentrations compared with HBsAg-negative subjects
(P,0.05). Our study is the first GWAS report which shows genetic components influence the levels of complement C3 and
C4. Our significant findings provide novel insights of their related autoimmune, infectious diseases, and molecular
mechanisms.

Introduction
The complement has been recognized as one pivotal part of
innate and adaptive immune system, and it had three well-known
physiologic activities, including host defense against infection,
bridging interface between innate and adaptive immunity, and
disposal of waste immune complexes or apoptotic cells [1,2].
There are approximately 30 serum complement proteins, which
can be activated by classical, alternative, and lectin pathways [3].
Among these complement members, C3 and C4 are almost
involved in all physiological activities and activated pathways, and
exert their powerful roles as host defense proteins [4]. Their
abnormal expression, especially, complement deficiency and
dysfunction, is associated with the pathogenesis of numerous
PLOS Genetics | www.plosgenetics.org 1 September 2012 | Volume 8 | Issue 9 | e1002916

inflammatory and autoimmune disorder diseases, such as systemic
lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis, asthma [1,5]. C4
deficiency also has been reported to be associated with SLE,
immune complex glomerulonephritis, virus infection, regardless of
ethnicity background [6,7,8].
Both Serum C3 and C4 levels are heritable traits even in
individuals without immune diseases such as SLE. Recent reports
also showed that the heritability for serum C3 and C4 were 39.6%
and 45.4%, respectively, based on Bayesian variance components
model [9,10]. Therefore, it is important to identify the genetic loci
which influence the serum levels of C3 and C4. In this study, we
carried out a two-stage Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS)
to identify novel loci that are associated with the serum levels of
C3 and C4 in a healthy Chinese male population of 3,495 subjects.
Methods
Study samples
A total of 2,012 men from the Fangchenggang Area Male
Health and Examination Survey (FAMHES) participated in the
stage 1 of GWAS study as healthy volunteers. The FAMHES
project was conducted in Fangchenggang city, Guangxi, southern
China in 2009. A total of 4,303 Chinese men ranged from age 17
to 88 years-old were recruited [11]. The subjects used in our stage
1 were limited to age 20 to 69 years-old, and were all self-reported
southern Chinese Han ethnicity. The replication subjects in the
stage 2 included 1,496 men age 20 to 70 years-old, who were
recruited in conjunction with health examinations that were
performed at three collaborating hospitals in Guangxi, China.
Written informed consents to participate in the present study
were obtained from all of the subjects. Standardized health
questionnaires were then used through a face-to-face interview
conducted by trained physicians. Collected data included demo￾graphic, lifestyle characteristics (smoking, alcohol consumption),
health status, family history, and medical histories. The subjects
who self-reported with diabetes mellitus, coronary heart disease,
stroke, hyperthyroidism, rheumatoid arthritis, and tumors were
excluded from the study population. The detected samples with
abnormal liver function (ALT) were also excluded. The study was
approved by the Ethics and Human Subject Committee of
Guangxi Medical University.
Measurement of complement C3 and C4
Overnight fasting venous blood specimens were drawn between
7:00 and 10:00 am, and serum samples were extracted and stored
at 280uC, until required for detection in the laboratory. Both
serum C3 and C4 were measured with Immunoturbidimetric
methods on the HITACHI 7600 biochemistry analyzer (Hitachi
Corp, Tokyo, Japan), using complement C3 and C4 assay kits
(Zhicheng Bio Company, Shanghai, China), and their inter-assay
coefficients of variation were 2.1% and 2.5%, respectively.
SNP genotyping
Two different platforms were used for SNP genotyping. The
Illumina Omini one platform was used for the genome-wide assay of
samples in stage 1. For SNPs that were followed in the 2nd stage, the
iPLEX of Sequenom platform was used for genotyping (Sequenom,
Inc., San Diego, CA). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and
extension primers were designed using MassARRAY Assay Design
3.1 software (Sequenom, Inc., San Diego, CA). Genotyping
procedures were performed according to the manufacturer’s iPLEX
Application Guide (Sequenom Inc. SanDiego, CA). All genotyping
reactions were performed in 384-well plates. Each plate included a
duplicate for three or four subjects selected at random, as well as six
to nine negative controls in which water was substituted for DNA.
The average concordance rate was 99.8%.
CNV analysis for C4 gene
To evaluate the C4 copy number variations (CNV), quantitative
PCR (qPCR) was performed using SYBR green chemistry on the
100 randomly selected subjects from Stage 1 population. Three
pairs of specific primers were designed at the front, middle rear
position of C4 gene. Two pairs of internal primers based on RPP14
and ALB genes were selected to normalize the nonspecific error.
Relative gene dosage determination was carried out using an ABI
7900 Real time PCR System. Total 12 ml PCR reaction mixture
contained 3 ml free water, 6 ml 26SYBR (ABI, Part no. 4304886),
1.8 ml primers, and 1.2 ml genomic DNA template. The delta-delta
Ct method was used to calculate the copy numbers of C4 gene. The
average C4 copy number was set at 4 based on previous reports.
Statistical analysis
Quality Control (QC) procedures were first applied to 2,012
individuals that were genotyped using the Illumina Omni one
platform. A total of 1,999 individuals passed the call rate of 95% and
were used in the final statistical analysis. We then applied the
following QC criteria to filter SNPs: P,0.001 for the Hardy￾Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE) test, minor allele frequency (MAF)
,0.01, and genotype call rate ,95%. A total of 709,211 SNPs
remained in the final analysis. The IMPUTE computer program
was then used to infer the genotypes of SNPs (e.g. SNPs catalogued
in Hapmap Phase II CHB population release #24) in the genome
that were not directly genotyped [12]. A posterior probability of
.0.90 was applied to call genotypes that were imputed from
IMPUTE software. A total of 1,940,245 SNPs remained in our final
analysis after applying the same QC criteria, as mentioned above.
Serum C4 levels were logarithmic transformed to normalize the
distribution. The associations of the SNPs with serum C3 and C4
levels were evaluated using a linear regression model assuming
additive effects of the alleles (0, 1 and 2). In the regression models,
the age, logBMI were adjusted as covariates for both C3 and C4,
and smoking also adjusted for C3.The PLINK software package
was used to perform this statistical analysis [13]. The EIGEN￾STRAT software was applied for the evaluation of population
stratification by a principal component approach [14]. The top
Author Summary
The complement system plays important roles in the
innate and adaptive immune functions. C3 and C4
participate in almost all physiological activities and
activated pathways as key complement members and
host defense proteins. Identifying the genes that influence
serum levels of C3 and C4 may help to elucidate the
factors and mechanisms underlying the complement
system. The genome-wide association studies (GWAS)
have shown great success in revealing robust associations
in both quantitative and qualitative traits. In this study, we
performed a two-stage GWAS in a large cohort from the
Chinese male population to examine the roles of common
genetic variants on serum C3 and C4 levels. Our research
identified genetic determinants associated with the quan￾titative levels of C3 and C4. Overall, our study highlights an
intricate regulation of complement levels and potentially
reveals novel mechanisms that may be followed up with
additional functional studies.

two eigenvectors were adjusted as covariates in the linear
regression analysis. Quantile-Quantile plots were generated using
R package. For regions with multiple SNPs that were significant at
a genome-wide significant level of 561028
, a stepwise (forwards -
backwards) regression modeling was performed to select the
independent SNPs to be confirmed in the 2nd stage. Firstly, the
most significant SNP within each of the associated region with C3
(1q21.3 and 19p13) and C4 (MHC region in 6p21.3) was entered
into the linear regression model. Secondly, the step-wise procedure
iteratively added SNPs (forwards) that reach genome-wide signif￾icant level in the single SNP analysis (with adjustment of covariates).
A SNP remains in the model if goodness-of-fit (the Arkaike
Information Criterion (AIC) metric) improves. A SNP that is
already in the model can also be removed if the AIC improves by
doing so. The stepwise procedure was performed by SAS 9.2 (Cary,
NC). The combined analysis of two-stage data was performed using
a linear regression, adjusting for the covariates and stage
information. ANOVA analysis was used to evaluate the difference
of serum C4 levels among the varied C4 gene dose groups.
Results
General subjects characters
The first stage was composed of 1999 healthy Chinese men, and
the second stage with 1496 male subjects. No significant difference
was found between samples of the first and the second stage
(Table 1) regarding to the mean age, smoking distribution and
mean body mass index, P.0.05, respectively. The frequency
distribution of C3 and C4 levels among the stage 1 healthy
population were shown in the Figure S1. An analysis of the
correlation between serum levels of C3 and C4 revealed a
significantly positive relationship (r = 0.521, P,0.01).
In stage 1, limited population stratification was observed (Figure
S2). In addition, we did not observe any evidence for the
systematic bias of the association for either C3 or C4 phenotype, as
indicated by the Quantile-Quantile (Q-Q) plots (Figure S3). The
inflation factor was estimated to be 1.046 and 1.054 for C3 and
C4, respectively.
GWAS for serum C3 levels
For C3 level, there are two genomic loci that were significant at
a P-value cutoff of 561028
, including one loci on 1q31.3 and one
loci on chromosome 19p13.3, respectively (Figure 1 and Figure
S4). For the region on 1q31.3, a total of four SNPs reached a P￾value cutoff of 1028
. Rs3753394 was the only SNP that remained
in the stepwise model selection procedure. Therefore, only
rs3753394 was selected to be followed up in stage 2. For the
region on chr19p13.3, the only SNP (rs3745567) that reached a P￾value of 561028 was followed in stage 2. In stage 2, both
rs3753394 and rs3745567 were confirmed to be significantly
associated with C3 levels at a P cut-off of 0.025 (Bonferroni
correction of 2 tests) (P = 1.0861023 and P = 3.5861024
, respec￾tively). The combined analysis of stage 1 and stage 2 data revealed
highly significant association with C3 level for rs3753394 and
rs374567 (P = 7.33610211 and P = 1.8361029
, respectively)
(Table 2). The estimated decrease for C3 level for rs3753394
was 0.05 g/l for each additional T allele (SE = 0.01). For
rs3745567, the estimated increase for C3 level was 0.08 g/l for
each additional T allele (SE = 0.02). In addition, the proportion of

variability in the C3 level explained by the two SNPs was 59.0%
(R2= 0.59) in our multivariate linear regression model.
GWAS for serum C4 levels
In the first stage, only one genomic locus was significantly
associated with serum level of C4 at a genome-wide significant
level (Figure 2). All those SNPs that reached a P-value cutoff of
561028 are located on the 6p21.3 region. A total of eight
independent SNPs were selected based on the stepwise procedure,
and were followed in the second stage (Figure S5). These
significant SNPs reside in a 2-Mb MHC region on chromosome
6p21.3 (Figure 3). Two SNPs (rs1052693 with a P-value of
3.26610210, and rs11575839 with a P-value of 9.70610235) were
located in the MHC class I area that include HLA-A, HLA-C, and
HLA-B genes. Two SNPs (rs2075799 with a P-value of
1.08610249, and rs2857009 with a P-value of 3.46610224) were
located 59 and 39 of C4 gene. The other four SNPs, rs2071278,
rs3763317, rs9276606, and rs241428 were located in the MHC
class II region that includes HLA-DRA, HLA-DRB, and HLA-DQB
genes. In stage 2, all eight SNPS were confirmed to be associated
with C4 level at a P-value cutoff of 0.006 (Bonferroni correction of
eight tests) (P value between 3.04610210 and 2.53610248). The
combined analysis also showed that these SNPs were highly
significant associated with C4 levels and reached a genome-wide
significant level (P value between 3.19610222 and 5.62610297)
(Table 2). In addition, among the eight SNPs we identified, the
range of the increase for C4 level per allele was from 0.08 g/l for
rs2857009 (SE = 0.01, P = 1.43610222), and 0.23 g/l for
rs1157839 (SE = 0.01, P = 1.22610254). Finally, the proportion
of variability in the C4 level explained by the eight SNPs reached
80.5% (R2= 0.805) in our multi-linear regression model.
Correlation of C4 gene CNV and serum C4 levels
As shown in Table 3, significant difference of serum C4 level
among the varied C4 gene dose groups were observed, with a P
value = 3.94610212. The serum C4 level was significantly higher
with each more copy of C4 gene, with a Ptrend= 5.18610218. The
lowest C4 gene dose group (N = 3, CNV = 2) only has a mean
levels of 0.1660.03 g/L of C4, which is significantly lower than
the group with average number of C4 gene dose (N = 56,
CNV = 4; mean value: 0.3360.01 g/L, P = 5.0661026
). The
highest C4 gene dose group (N = 3, CNV = 7 or 8) had the mean
levels of 0.4860.04 g/L of C4, which is significantly higher than
the general dose group, with a P-value of 8.2461025
.
Discussion
To our knowledge, our study represents one of the first efforts to
identify genetic loci that determine the serum levels of C3 and C4
using a two-stage GWAS approach. We identified three indepen￾dent genetic loci that were significant at a genome-wide significant
level (P value,161028
) in a Chinese population of 3,495 healthy
men, with a P-value range from 1.8361029 to 5.62610299. Those
include SNPs rs3745567 (C3 gene) and rs3753394 (CFH-CFHR1
gene cluster) and eight independent SNPs in the ,2 Mb MHC
region on chr6 that were significantly associated with serum level
of C3 and C4, respectively.
The first confirmed SNP was rs3753394, which is located
within the complement factor H (CFH) and CFH-related gene
(CFHR1-5) cluster on 1q31.3. CFH encodes the complement
factor H that regulates complement activation on self cells by
possessing both cofactor activity for the factor I mediated C3b
cleavage, and decay accelerating activity against the alternative
pathway C3 convertase [15,16]. CFHRs contain similar surface
recognition region of CFH and there has been evidence that they
may play a role in C3b inactivation by binding with C3b [17].
rs3753394 was located in a ,200 kb LD block region that CFH,
CFHR1 and CFHR3 genes. Thus one possibility is that the genetic
variants of rs3753394, may affect the expression or function of
one of these three genes, which in turn may cause different
modulatory activities towards complement C3 and lead to
different levels of C3 proteins. We further used the Genevar
(GENE Expression VARiation) database to examine whether

rs3753394 is associated with gene expression of CFH and CFH￾related genes. rs3753394 was found to be significantly associated with
the gene expression level of CFHR1 (P= 0.0187) in 156 lympho￾blastoid cell line derived from a subset of healthy female twins of the
MuTHER resource [18]. No association between rs3753394 and
CFH or other CFH family members was found (P.0.05). Thus one
plausible hypothesis is that the observed rs3753394-C3 association
may be causally related with CFHR1 expression.
The second associated SNP with serum level of C3, rs3745567,
is located in the intron region of C3. Two previous candidate gene
studies from Japan and UK SLE families, also showed that genetic
variants located in C3 gene region significantly influence serum C3
levels in SLE patients. The reported SNPs were rs344555 in the 39
(P = 0.007) and rs7951 in the exon 35 (P = 0.0024) of C3 [10,19].
However, neither rs7951 nor rs344555 was significantly associated
with C3 level in our healthy study subjects (P = 0.51 and P = 0.16,
respectively). We then carefully examined the LD structure for
CEU, CHB and JPT based on the HapMap Phase II data. The
LD structure greatly differed among those three populations in C3
region (data not shown). Therefore, we may speculate that the
previously reported SNP, and the SNP we identified may
represent different tagging SNPs for the functional causal SNP

in C3 region. The functional variants that reside in C3 gene region
need to be further identified.
For C4, all the eight significant SNPs reside in a 2-Mb MHC
region on chromosome 6p21. Interestingly, both the complement
C4A and C4B genes whose gene products contribute to serum C4
located in the class III region of MHC on 6p21.3 [8], so the C4
locus is the most likely candidate with the MHC. Within the MHC
region, the C4 locus (C4A and C4B paralogues) is the most likely
candidate gene that is responsible for serum level of C4. Copy
number variations of C4 gene, as well as gene size polymorphisms
of C4 (short or long form) copy number, are known to determine
the serum level of C4 [20,21]. Based on our CNV analysis from
the 100 subjects of the stage 1 population, we showed that the total
C4 gene dosages were positively correlated with serum levels of
C4. Therefore, we can’t exclude the possibilities that the SNPs
identified in MHC region may be in LDs with C4 gene copy
number or gene size variations. To answer the above question, we
evaluated the correlation between C4 gene copy number and the
eight SNPs identified. The Pearson correlation coefficients
between the eight SNPs and C4 copy number are moderate, with
a range of 0.21 to 0.36 (Table S2). However, seven out of eight
SNPs were no longer significant after adjustment for C4 copy
number variation (Table S2). One SNP (rs2857009) still remained
significant after adjustment for copy number variation. This
suggested that although the majority of SNPs identified may be
correlated with copy numbers of C4, one SNP (rs2857009) may
confer independent effect on affecting the concentration of C4.
The combination of C4 gene CNV and the SNP information can
better explain the genetic components which influence the
complement C4 variation. However, we would also like to point
out that the above results are based on a relatively small sample
size, future studies with a larger sample size is needed to confirm
our finding.
Since the identified C4-associated SNPs were located in the
MHC region, it will be interesting to know the relationship
between those SNPs and known Human Leukocyte Antigens
(HLA) alleles. We evaluated whether those eight SNPs and their
perfect proxies (r2= 1 based on HapMap 3 plus 1,000 genome
project) tag the known HLA alleles, based on the HLA and SNP
haplotype map developed by de Bakker et al [22]. However, none
of the eight SNPs or their perfect proxies was found to tag the
known HLA alleles in CHB population. Two reasons may
potentially explain it. First, the number of individuals that were
used to construct such map was small (N = 45). Therefore,
haplotypes with relatively low frequencies were not detected. In
a recent study, a new HLA and SNP haplotype map was available
based on a relatively larger population (N = 3,000), which
represented an improved haplotype map with much higher
resolution [23]. However, this map was currently available for
Caucasians only. Second, our study population represents a
southern Chinese population. The LD structure of our population
may differ from CHB population, which represents a northern
Chinese population. The LD structure may even differ signifi￾cantly in the highly polymorphic MHC region between CHB and
our study population. Therefore, a HLA and SNP haplotype map
that is specific to this study population may be more informative to
infer the LD between the identified C4 associated SNPs and
known HLA alleles.
Some confounding factors, such as age, smoking, BMI, and
hsCRP, are predictive of the C3 or C4 levels, however, the most
significant covariate for C3 is the BMI (P = 2.8861027
) , and age
for C4 (P = 5.56610211) in our multivariate linear model which
also included novel SNPs identified in this study. Together, those
variables could explain more than 90% of variance of C4 level
(R2
.0.90). Serum level of high-sensitivity Chronic Reactive
Protein (hsCRP) levels, which is a potential confounder for the
acute phase reactants C3 and C4 protein, was also available in our
dataset. Further adjustment of hsCRP revealed similar results
(Table S1). Considering the high infection rate of hepatitis B virus
in the general Chinese population and its potential influence for
complement, we furthermore carried out interaction analysis of
infection-by-genotype. Although both the C3 and C4 levels in the
HBsAg positive group were significantly lower than the negative
group in the combined 3495 subjects (1.0960.21 vs1.1860.34 for
C3 and 0.3260.09 vs 0.3460.10 for C4, P,0.05, respectively),
however, no significant interaction was observed between HBsAg
infection and previous identified SNPs in our multivariate linear
regression model, P.0.05, respectively. The potential cause could
be that the synthesis ability of complements was still normal in the
liver organ.
In summary, through a two-stage GWAS of 3,495 healthy
Chinese male subjects, we identified CFH and C3 loci were
significantly associated with serum level of C3, and a ,2 Mb loci
on 6p21.3 region was significantly associated with serum level of
C4. The selection of healthy subjects from one centralized
resource and the stringent inclusion and exclusion criteria were
considered as two of the advantages of our study design. Our study
would contribute to the understanding of genetic components that
affect individual level of complement variation. It may also shed
light on the etiology and molecular mechanisms for C3 and C4
related diseases.
