Abstract
Objective Despite improvements in imaging, serum 
CA19-9 and pathological evaluation, differentiating 
between benign and malignant bile duct strictures 
remains a diagnostic conundrum. Recent developments 
in next-generation sequencing (NGS) have opened new 
opportunities for early detection and management of 
cancers but, to date, have not been rigorously applied to 
biliary specimens.
Design We prospectively evaluated a 28-gene 
NGS panel (BiliSeq) using endoscopic retrograde 
cholangiopancreatography-obtained biliary specimens 
from patients with bile duct strictures. The diagnostic 
performance of serum CA19-9, pathological evaluation 
and BiliSeq was assessed on 252 patients (57 trainings 
and 195 validations) with 346 biliary specimens.
Results The sensitivity and specificity of BiliSeq for 
malignant strictures was 73% and 100%, respectively. 
In comparison, an elevated serum CA19-9 and 
pathological evaluation had sensitivities of 76% and 
48%, and specificities of 69% and 99%, respectively. 
The combination of BiliSeq and pathological evaluation 
increased the sensitivity to 83% and maintained a 
specificity of 99%. BiliSeq improved the sensitivity of 
pathological evaluation for malignancy from 35% to 
77% for biliary brushings and from 52% to 83% for 
biliary biopsies. Among patients with primary sclerosing 
cholangitis (PSC), BiliSeq had an 83% sensitivity as 
compared with pathological evaluation with an 8% 
sensitivity. Therapeutically relevant genomic alterations 
were identified in 20 (8%) patients. Two patients 
with ERBB2-amplified cholangiocarcinoma received 
a trastuzumab-based regimen and had measurable 
clinicoradiographic response.
Conclusions The combination of BiliSeq and 
pathological evaluation of biliary specimens increased 
the detection of malignant strictures, particularly in 
patients with PSC. Additionally, BiliSeq identified 
alterations that may stratify patients for specific 
anticancer therapies.
Introduction
Strictures involving the bile duct represent a hetero￾geneous group of benign and malignant conditions.1
Benign bile duct strictures may be due to primary 
sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), IgG4-related scle￾rosing cholangitis, iatrogenic injury, infection and 
other less common aetiologies. Malignant causes 
include carcinomas involving the pancreatobiliary 
ducts, ampulla of Vater, liver and, rarely, metastatic 
cancers. However, differentiating between benign 
and malignant bile duct strictures can be chal￾lenging and relies on a multidisciplinary approach 
of clinical examination, biochemical testing (eg, 
serum CA19-9), radiographic imaging, endo￾scopic procedures and pathological evaluation with 
Significance of this study
What is already known on this subject?
► Despite a multidisciplinary approach, 
distinguishing between benign and malignant 
bile duct strictures can be challenging.
► Whole exome and whole genome sequencing 
studies have defined the genetic landscape of 
neoplasms arising and secondarily involving the 
bile duct system.
► A test that could detect key genomic 
alterations in malignant neoplasms 
involving the bile duct system may be of 
diagnostic utility to endoscopic retrograde 
cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)-obtained 
biliary specimens.

Significance of this study
What are the new findings?
► We have developed and validated a highly sensitive, targeted 
next-generation sequencing (NGS) assay (BiliSeq) within a 
Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments-certified and 
College of American Pathologists-accredited laboratory for 28 
genes that are commonly mutated, amplified and/or deleted 
in malignant neoplasms involving the bile duct system.
► A large prospective analysis of ERCP-obtained biliary 
specimens revealed BiliSeq improved the sensitivity of 
pathological evaluation for both biliary brushing and biliary 
biopsy specimens.
► Among patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis, BiliSeq 
was superior to serum CA19-9 and pathological evaluation in 
detecting at least high-grade biliary dysplasia.
► BiliSeq identified potentially actionable genomic alterations 
with demonstratable chemotherapeutic response for a subset 
of patients.
How might it impact on clinical practice in the foreseeable 
future?
► These results highlight the diagnostic applicability of NGS￾based assays to ERCP-obtained biliary specimens in early 
detection and management of patients with malignant bile 
duct strictures.
ancillary studies.2
 This distinction is more arduous considering 
the aetiology of some benign strictures can be a predisposing 
factor for malignancy. For example, PSC is associated with a 
400-fold increased risk of cholangiocarcinoma as compared with 
the general population.
Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) 
plays a key role in the evaluation of a bile duct stricture by 
defining the morphometric imaging features and extent of 
disease involvement.3
 However, there are no pathognomonic 
features seen during fluoroscopy that can differentiate benign 
from malignant. Furthermore, direct cholangioscopic grading 
is inaccurate and suffers from poor interobserver agreement.4 5
During ERCP, bile duct brushings and forceps biopsies are the 
methods of choice for pathological confirmation; however, 
the sensitivity of detecting malignancy can range between 8% 
and 67%.4 6–11 To improve the detection of malignant stric￾tures, adjunctive techniques were developed and include digital 
image analysis, KRAS mutational testing and fluorescence in 
situ hybridisation.12–18 However, the sensitivities of these assays 
range between 14% and 60%. Considering the low sensitivity 
of pathological evaluation and available ancillary studies, it is 
not surprising that patients often undergo multiple ERCP proce￾dures for diagnostic purposes. As a result, therapeutic decisions 
for malignant strictures are often delayed by several weeks to 
months, which places patients at risk for disease progression. 
Conversely, a misdiagnosis of a benign bile duct stricture can 
result in unnecessary surgical resection. It is reported that up 
to 15% of patients undergoing surgery for a suspected malig￾nant stricture have benign disease.19 20 This is alarming given 
these surgical resections are associated with a relatively, high 
morbidity and mortality.21–24 Thus, more innovative preop￾erative approaches are needed to improve the stratification of 
patients with benign and malignant strictures.
Over the past several years, dramatic progress has been made 
in understanding the genomic landscape of neoplasms arising 
or secondarily involving the bile duct system. Whole exome 
and whole genome sequencing studies have reported recurrent 
genomic alterations in a relatively small number of oncogenes 
and tumour suppressor genes, such as KRAS, TP53, CDKN2A
and SMAD4.
25–34 Moreover, a subset of these genomic alter￾ations, such as ATM and ERBB2, may confer susceptibility to 
specific anticancer therapies. In parallel, the introduction of 
novel molecular diagnostics has opened new opportunities for 
the study of preoperative specimens.35 36 Bile duct specimens 
are often characterised by small quantities of diagnostic mate￾rial and composed of heterogeneous cell populations, which 
may obscure or mimic a malignant process. It is therefore 
crucial for a molecular assay to be highly sensitive to detect 
small proportions of mutated cells within these specimens. 
Next-generation sequencing (NGS) combines a high analyt￾ical sensitivity with multigene analysis and thus represents an 
attractive option for the assessment of bile duct strictures.
In this study, we developed a highly sensitive, targeted 
NGS assay, known as BiliSeq, for 28 genes that are commonly 
mutated, amplified and/or deleted in malignant neoplasms 
involving the bile duct system.25–34 37 This test was performed 
within a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-
certified and College of American Pathologists (CAP)-accredited 
clinical laboratory using ERCP-obtained bile duct brushings 
and/or biopsies. Rather than extracting DNA from cytological 
smears/slides, alcohol fixative (eg, CytoLyt) or formalin-fixed 
paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue, which may decrease overall 
yields and quality, a dedicated bile duct brushing and/or biopsy 
was submitted directly for BiliSeq testing after routine specimens 
were obtained for pathological evaluation. Our objectives were 
to prospectively evaluate BiliSeq testing on a large cohort of 
patients to: (1) determine its accuracy in the detection of malig￾nant strictures, (2) compare its performance as an adjunct to 
other diagnostic modalities and (3) evaluate the ramifications on 
patient management when genomic alterations are detected in 
bile duct specimens.
Materials and methods
Patient population
A training cohort of biliary specimens from 57 patients was 
prospectively collected by standard ERCP at the University 
of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) from patients with a 
bile duct stricture between September 2014 and April 2016 
and funded by the University of Pittsburgh Department of 
Pathology. On completion of the training cohort, a validation 
cohort of 195 patients was prospectively accrued between 
September 2016 and August 2018 and partially funded by 
the Institute for Precision Medicine at the University of Pitts￾burgh. In total, 163 biliary brushings and 172 biliary biopsies 
were collected for pathological evaluation, and 160 brushings 
and 135 biopsies were collected for BiliSeq testing. Bile duct 
specimens were submitted to the UPMC Anatomic Pathology 
laboratory for routine cytopathological and pathological 
evaluation and the UPMC Molecular & Genomic Pathology 
(MGP) Laboratory for BiliSeq testing within 24–48 hours of
the ERCP procedure. Medical records were reviewed to docu￾ment patient demographics, clinical presentation, ERCP find￾ings, concurrent endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) and EUS-fine
needle aspiration (FNA), serum CA19-9 levels and patholog￾ical diagnoses of corresponding brushings and/or biopsies. A 
separate analysis was performed for repeat ERCP procedures 
that yielded 24 biliary brushings and 29 biliary biopsies for 
pathological evaluation and 24 brushings and 27 biopsies for

BiliSeq testing. The aetiology of the stricture was based on 
diagnostic pathology (n=145) from surgical resected spec￾imens or biopsy specimens (either autopsy, open or lapa￾roscopic surgical resection/biopsy, percutaneous needle or 
ERCP-obtained biliary biopsy) and/or clinical criteria (n=75)
after  ≥12 months of follow-up. As the reported specificity
of biliary brushings is <100%, the findings from patholog￾ical evaluation of brushing specimens were not considered as 
diagnostic pathology. Furthermore, a negative ERCP-obtained
biopsy was not considered supportive of a benign aetiology. A 
stricture was designated as a benign cholangiopathy if a repeat 
imaging or ERCP at ≥12 months follow-up documented the
resolution or stability of prior ductal abnormalities. In contrast,
a clinical diagnosis of malignancy was defined by the combi￾nation of a mass on radiographic imaging in the absence of 
acute cholangiopathy, and clinical or radiographic progression 
after ≥12 months of follow-up, or death clinically and radio￾graphically determined to be due to a malignancy involving 
the bile duct. For surgical resection and biopsy specimens, 
diagnoses were rendered on the basis of standard histomor￾phological criteria.38 Diagnostic and clinical follow-up infor￾mation including the method of follow-up for each patient is
described in detail within online supplementary table 1.
Specimen collection
Samples were obtained during the ERCP procedure and 
included cytological brushings, forceps biopsies or both. For 
cytological brushes, samples were collected with multiple 
to-and-fro motions at the site of the stricture. The brush used
for cytopathological examination and was placed into 15 mL
of ThinPrep CytoLyt solution (Hologic, Marlborough, Massa￾chusetts, USA) and transferred for specimen processing within 
24 hours. A separate brush was used for BiliSeq testing and 
placed into a collection vial containing a detergent-based
DNA lysis buffer. The collection vial was then transported to 
the UPMC MGP laboratory within 24 hours and processed
accordingly. A similar approach was used for forceps biop￾sies with separate biopsies submitted for pathological exam￾ination and BiliSeq testing. No minimum specimen cellularity 
was required for testing. All specimens whether a brushing or 
biopsy were processed the same.
BiliSeq testing
NGS was performed prospectively as part of clinical care and 
within a 10-day turnaround in the UPMC MGP laboratory, 
which is both CLIA-certified and CAP-accredited. Genomic 
DNA was isolated similarly for both brushing and biopsy spec￾imens using the MagNA Pure LC Total Nucleic Acid Isola￾tion Kit (Roche, Indianapolis, Indiana, USA) on Compact 
MagNA Pure (Roche). In cases where both a brushing and 
biopsy specimen was submitted, the DNA from both speci￾mens was combined for subsequent analysis. Extracted DNA 
was quantified on the Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer using the dsDNA 
HS Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, Massachu￾setts, USA). Amplification-based targeted NGS was performed
with primers for genomic regions of interest (https://mgp.

(Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, California, USA). The Ion 
One Touch 2 and One Touch ES were used to prepare and 
enrich templates and enable testing via Ion Sphere Particles 
on a semiconductor chip. Massive parallel sequencing was 
carried out on an Ion Proton System according to the manu￾facturer’s instructions (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and analysed 
with the Torrent Suite Software V.3.4.2 for point mutations, 
small insertions/deletions and copy number alterations. Each 
variant was prioritised according to the 2017 Association for 
Molecular Pathology (AMP)/American Society of Clinical 
Oncology (ASCO)/College of American Pathologists (CAP) 
joint consensus guidelines for interpretation of sequence vari￾ants in cancer using a tier-based system.40 Tier I, Tier II and 
Tier III variants were reported; however, only Tier I and Tier 
II variants were used for subsequent analysis. The presence of 
a genomic alteration that qualified as a Tier I or Tier II variant 
was considered to be a ‘positive’ BiliSeq result, while a ‘nega￾tive’ BiliSeq result was determined to be the absence of a Tier I 
or Tier II variant. The limit of detection of the assay was at 3% 
mutant allele frequency (AF). The minimum depth of coverage 
for testing was 500×. For each mutation identified, a AF was 
calculated based on the number of reads of the mutant allele 
versus the wild-type allele and reported as a percentage.35
Copy number variation analysis was performed as previously 
described.41 A gene amplification was defined by the presence 
of ≥6 copies of a variant as previously described and validated
using fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) analysis.41 42
Classification of targetable genomic alterations
Clinically relevant genomic alterations were defined as alter￾ations that are targetable by anticancer drugs currently available 
on the market or in registered clinical trials. Genomic alterations 
that are potentially targetable with reported kinase inhibitors (in 
the setting of wild-type KRAS, NRAS and HRAS genomic alter￾ations) include: ALK, BRAF, EGFR, ERBB2, FGFR1, FGFR2, 
FGFR3 and MET.
43–46 Genomic alterations within ATM may be 
targeted with platinum-based regimens and poly-(ADP-ribose) 
polymerase inhibition.47 Also, pharmacological inhibitors highly 
specific to individual IDH1 and IDH2 mutations have been 
developed.48 49
Statistical analysis
The sample size estimate/power calculation for the training 
cohort used within this study was based on a 60% prevalence 
of malignancy among bile duct strictures at our institution and 
corresponding 40% sensitivity for detecting malignancy using 
pathological evaluation of ERCP-obtained specimens. Therefore, 
a sample size of at least 50 patients would yield a >80%power 
with an alpha of 0.05. Statistical analyses to assess differences 
in mutational status were compared using Fisher’s exact test for 
dichotomous variables. For the training cohort, receiver oper￾ating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated to compare 
biomarker performances and to establish cut-off levels, using the 
Youden index. Final cut-offs were selected to maximise the area 
under the curve (AUC) as calculated by the trapezoidal method. 
However, biological rationale and the simplicity of the model 
were also considered. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated 
using standard 2×2contingency tables for cases with confirmed 
diagnostic pathology. Unless otherwise stated, repeat testing was 
not used to calculate sensitivity and specificity for individual

BiliSeq testing within training and validation cohorts
A training cohort of 57 patients that underwent ERCP for a bile 
duct stricture were prospectively accrued for biomarker analysis 
and summarised in table 1, online supplementary data and table 
1. Serum CA19-9 studies, bile duct brushings and/or biopsies 
for pathological evaluation and BiliSeq testing were performed 
for 56 of 57 (98%) patients with only one patient that did not 
have a CA19-9 measurement at the time of clinical presentation. 
Considering the lack of a consensus CA19-9 cut-off as a marker 
of malignant strictures, an exploratory study of CA19-9 levels 
was performed (online supplementary figure 1). By ROC curve 
analysis, serum CA19-9 could distinguish malignant from benign 
strictures with an AUC of 0.727. At a threshold of ≥44U/mL
chosen using Youden’s index, an elevated CA19-9 yielded a 
sensitivity of 62% and specificity of 77% for detecting malig￾nancy (table 2). Specimens obtained during ERCP for patholog￾ical evaluation included biliary brushings for 22 (39%) patients, 
biliary biopsies for 22 (39%) patients and both biliary brushings 
and biopsies for 13 (22%) patients. A pathological diagnosis of 
at least suspicious for adenocarcinoma was associated with a 
sensitivity and specificity of 46% and 100%, respectively, for 
malignancy.
A paired but separate biliary brushing and/or biopsy spec￾imen was also submitted for BiliSeq testing. However, for the 13 
patients who had both brushing and biopsy specimens for patho￾logical evaluation, only two patients had paired brushing and 
biopsy specimens obtained for BiliSeq testing. For the remaining 
11 patients, a corresponding brushing specimen, but not biopsy 
specimen, was submitted for BiliSeq testing. In total, 59 bile duct 
specimens from 57 patients were evaluated by BiliSeq. Genomic 
alterations were only detected in malignant strictures and not 
present in cases with benign cholangiopathy (figure 1). The 
sensitivity and specificity of a genomic alteration identified by 
BiliSeq was 63% and 100%, respectively.
A validation cohort was prospectively collected and consisted 
of 195 patients with follow-up for 163 (84%) patients (table 1, 
online supplementary data and table 1). A serum CA19-9 was 
measured at the time of presentation for 144 of 163 (88%) 
patients. Specimens submitted for pathological evaluation 
included biliary brushings for 49 (30%) patients, biliary biopsies 
for 57 (35%) patients and both biliary brushings and biopsies for 
57 (35%) patients. A paired but separate brushing and/or biopsy 
specimen was also submitted for BiliSeq testing. For the 57 
patients that had both brushing and biopsy specimens for patho￾logical evaluation, 27 (47%) also had separate brushing and 
biopsy specimens submitted for BiliSeq testing. Of the remaining 
30 patients, corresponding brushings or biopsies were obtained 
for 24 patients and 6 patients, respectively, for BiliSeq testing. In 
total, 190 bile duct specimens from 163 patients were submitted 
for BiliSeq testing.
Based on cut-off of ≥44U/mL, serum CA19-9 within the vali￾dation cohort had a sensitivity of 81% and specificity of 65% 
for at least high-grade biliary dysplasia (table 2). Similar to the 
training cohort, the performance of pathological evaluation and 
BiliSeq testing was associated with sensitivities and specificities 
of 49% and 98%, and 76% and 100%, respectively. An overall 
analysis of both training and validation cohorts that included 
220 patients with follow-up revealed sensitivities and speci￾ficities for serum CA19-9, pathological evaluation and BiliSeq 
testing of 76% and 69%, 48% and 99%, and 73% and 100%. 
The combination of pathological evaluation and BiliSeq testing 
increased the sensitivity of both assays to 83% and maintained a 
high specificity of 99%. The addition of serum CA19-9 to patho￾logical evaluation and BiliSeq testing further improved the sensi￾tivity to 95%, but the specificity decreased to 68%.
A subanalysis of bile duct specimen subtypes, history of PSC 
and repeat ERCP with biomarker testing
A total of 132 biliary brushings and 114 biliary biopsies had 
paired pathological evaluation and BiliSeq testing (table 3). 
The sensitivities and specificities for pathological evaluation of 
biliary brushings and biliary biopsies was 35% and 98%, and 
52% and 100%, respectively. In comparison, BiliSeq testing of 
biliary brushings and biliary biopsies was associated with higher 
sensitivities of 71% and 75%, respectively, and specificities of 
100%. Among 114 biliary biopsies, 28 specimens were obtained 
by digital cholangioscopy, while the remaining specimens were 
acquired through cholangiography. No statistically significant

differences in sensitivity and specificity were identified between 
cholangioscopic-guided and cholangiographic-guided biliary 
biopsies (online supplementary table 2). Matching biliary 
brushing and biliary biopsy specimens for both pathological 
evaluation and BiliSeq testing were submitted for 29 patients. 
Pathological evaluation of brushings and biopsies, and BiliSeq 
testing of brushings and biopsies for these cases had sensitivities 
of 26%, 39%, 70% and 78%, respectively, and specificities of 
100%.
EUS-FNA may improve the diagnosis of malignant distal bile 
duct strictures. In total, 141 patients with follow-up presented 
with a distal bile duct stricture and a concurrent EUS was 
performed for 86 patients and FNA for 61 patients. Among the 
61 patients with concurrent ERCP and EUS-FNA, the sensitiv￾ities and specificities of detecting a malignant distal bile duct 
stricture based on pathological evaluation of ERCP-obtained 
biliary specimens and EUS-FNA specimens were 59% and 95%, 
and 58% and 100%, respectively. In comparison, BiliSeq testing 
yielded a sensitivity of 76% and specificity of 100%. Further￾more, combining pathological evaluation of ERCP-obtained 
specimens and BiliSeq testing was associated with a 90% 
sensitivity and 95% specificity for malignancy. The sensitivity 
increased to 93% with the addition of EUS-FNA evaluation and 
the specificity remained at 95%.
Thirty-seven of 220 (17%) patients had a documented history of
PSC. This cohort consisted of 12 bile duct strictures with at least 
high-grade biliary dysplasia and 25 biliary strictures with benign
cholangiopathy. As per the American Association for the Study of 
Liver Diseases (AASLD) guidelines, a serum CA19-9 of >129U/mL
is a marker of suspected cholangiocarcinoma within this high-risk
population.50 Therefore, based on a cut-off of 129U/mL, serum
CA19-9 was associated with a 67% sensitivity and 84% specificity 
for at least high-grade biliary dysplasia. Pathological evaluation had 
a sensitivity of only 8% and specificity of 100%. In contrast, the 
sensitivity and specificity of BiliSeq testing was 83% and 100%, 
respectively. Combining serum CA19-9 to BiliSeq testing increased 
the sensitivity to 92% but decreased the specificity to 84%. The 
addition of pathological evaluation to BiliSeq testing did not 
improve the sensitivity of BiliSeq alone.
A repeat ERCP with biliary brushings and/or biopsies for patho￾logical evaluation and Biliseq testing was performed for 20 of 220 
(9%) patients (online supplementary table 3). This procedure was 
repeated once for 16 patients, twice for two patients and thrice for 
two patients. On the basis of follow-up, 15 patients had a malig￾nant stricture and five patients had a benign stricture. Among the 
15 patients with a malignant stricture, 8 patients had genomic 
alterations detected by BiliSeq on initial and repeat bile duct spec￾imens. However, corresponding pathological evaluation of initial 
biliary brushings and/or biopsies were negative for malignancy. 
In fact, a preoperative diagnosis of at least suspicious for malig￾nancy was never rendered for 5 of 8 malignant strictures. For the 
remaining seven patients, repeat biomarker testing was positive 
for malignancy by pathological evaluation and detectable genomic 
alterations (‘positive’) by BiliSeq testing for two patients; negative 
by pathology, but positive by BiliSeq for two patients; and both 
diagnostic modalities were negative for one patient. Inclusion of 
repeat ERCPs marginally increased the sensitivity and specificities 
of pathological evaluation, BiliSeq testing and the combination of

Comparative BiliSeq testing of paired ERCP-obtained bile 
duct specimens and diagnostic pathology specimens
Diagnostic pathological material was available for 145 of 220 
(66%) patients and consisted of 134 malignancies and 11 benign 
cholangiopathies. BiliSeq testing was performed on the diagnostic 
pathology specimen for 54 of 134 (40%) malignancies (online 
supplementary table 4). Genomic alterations were detected in all 
54 cases that also included 12 patients with ERCP-obtained bile 
duct specimens that were negative for genomic alterations by 
BiliSeq. Among the remaining 42 tumours, the genomic profile 
was different for four cases that included additional genomic 
alterations than those detected by BiliSeq using ERCP-obtained 
bile duct specimens.
Therapeutically relevant genomic alterations and treatment 
data
On the basis of previously reported actionable targets and 
predictive markers of chemotherapeutic response, BiliSeq testing 
of ERCP-obtained bile duct specimens identified therapeutically 
relevant genomic alterations for 20 of 150 (13%) cancers (online 
supplementary figure 2). Alterations in genes involved in the 
receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)/Ras/Mitogen-activated protein 
(MAP) kinase signalling pathway, which included ERBB2 (n=6), 
MET (n=4), ALK (n=2), FGFR2 (n=3) and FGFR3 (n=2), were 
detected in the majority of cases (n=13, 65%). Other potentially 
actionable alterations were found in ATM (n=2), IDH1 (n=1) 
and IDH2 (n=2).
Among the ERBB2-altered malignancies, two patients, 
whose adenocarcinoma harboured a copy number gain in 
ERBB2, received targeted chemotherapy to HER2/neu instead 
of standard chemotherapy alone. The first patient (online 
supplementary table 1, patient 157) is an elderly woman 
presenting with jaundice, worsening abdominal pain for a week, 
elevated liver function tests, a serum CA19-9 of 55U/mL and 
a CT scan that showed gallstones and intrahepatic ductal dila￾tation. An ERCP demonstrated an intrahepatic bile duct stric￾ture that was brushed for both pathological evaluation and 
BiliSeq testing. Pathological evaluation of the biliary brushings 
revealed highly atypical epithelial cells, suspicious for adeno￾carcinoma. However, BiliSeq testing detected an ERBB2 copy 
number gain and a TP53 mutation (p.C242fs*5 and c.723delC). 
Within 2 weeks, a subsequent triphasic CT scan revealed a 
2.1cm metastatic liver lesion in segment 4B/5 (figure 2A), and 
her serum CA19-9 was 422.4U/mL. A diagnosis of malignancy 
was confirmed after repeat ERCP with both bile duct brushings 
and biopsy as an invasive moderately-differentiated adenocar￾cinoma. Clinically considered to be an intrahepatic cholangio￾carcinoma, the patient was started on gemcitabine, cisplatin and 
trastuzumab. Within 3 months of treatment, her serum CA19-9 
decreased to 14U/mL and the metastatic liver lesion decreased to 
0.6cm. Furthermore, a follow-up ERCP noted an improvement 
in the patient’s bile duct stricture (online supplementary figure 
3). One year after diagnosis, the patient is currently alive and 
well. Her serum CA19-9 continues to be within normal limits, 
and the metastatic lesion measures 0.3cm in greatest dimension 
(figure 2B).
The second patient (online supplementary table 1, patient 
166) is a middle-aged men who presented with jaundice, upper 
abdominal pain, elevated liver function tests, an elevated serum 
CA19-9 of 2383U/mL, thickening of his perihilar bile duct on 
CT and a hilar stricture on MRCP. A Bismuth IIIa stricture was 
identified on ERCP and bile duct brushings and biopsy were 
positive for adenocarcinoma. The patient’s corresponding 
BiliSeq testing revealed a copy number gain in ERBB2 and copy 
number losses in TP53 and CDKN2A. The patient was referred 
for a liver transplantation, but on further workup was found to 
have a 2.6cm metastatic lesion within segment 7/8 (figure 2C). 
At a serum CA19-9 of 7959U/mL, the patient started a regimen 
of gemcitabine, cisplatin and trastuzumab for a clinical peri￾hilar cholangiocarcinoma. After 3 months, the patient’s serum 
CA19-9 normalised to 9.4U/mL. Eight months after diagnosis, 
the patient is currently alive and well. His serum CA19-9 
continues to be within normal limits and the metastatic lesion 
decreased to 0.7cm in greatest dimension (figure 2D).
Discussion
Despite improvements in cross-sectional imaging, serum studies, 
endoscopic technologies and pathological evaluation, the distinc￾tion between benign and malignant bile duct strictures remains 
a diagnostic conundrum. In the current study, we developed and 
independently clinically validated a targeted NGS assay for the 
evaluation of bile duct strictures. We found our targeted NGS 
assay, BiliSeq, had a higher sensitivity (73% vs 48%) and a higher 
specificity (100% vs 99%) than pathological evaluation alone 
for detecting at least high-grade biliary dysplasia involving the 
bile duct. Moreover, the combination of both tests (BiliSeq and 
pathological evaluation) had a higher sensitivity than either test 
alone (83%), while maintaining a high specificity (99%).
To date, a few studies have investigated the application of 
targeted NGS to bile duct strictures. Recently, Bankov et al
published the results of an NGS assay of similar design to BiliSeq 
using a retrospective cohort of 16 patients with indeterminant 
bile duct biopsies and cholangiocarcinoma on follow-up.51 The 
authors did not evaluate biliary brushing specimens and DNA

obtained for NGS was extracted from FFPE tissue blocks. The 
authors acknowledged that due to the low input and low quality 
of DNA from FFPE tissue, a DNA enrichment technique was 
required for subsequent analysis. While a benign control group 
was not used for comparison, the sensitivity of their assay was 
81%, which is comparable with BiliSeq. A more comprehensive 
assessment of NGS testing on bile duct specimens was reported 
by Dudley et al.6
 The authors evaluated a cohort of 73 bile duct 
and 8 main pancreatic duct brushing specimens. Contrary to 
Bankov et al, their study cohort did not include bile duct biop￾sies. Furthermore, rather than obtaining a dedicated brushing 
for DNA isolation, DNA was extracted from CytoLyt-preserved 
specimens. As alcohol fixation may result in DNA degradation, it 
is not unexpected that 8 of 73 (11%) brushing specimens failed 
NGS testing. Within our study, none of the biliary brushing and/
or biopsy specimens failed BiliSeq testing. Regardless, among the 
remaining 65 biliary brushing specimens, Dudley et al reported a 
sensitivity of 68% and a specificity of 97%, which was superior 
to pathological evaluation. The authors did however identify one 
false positive result. For this case, the duration of follow-up after 
NGS testing was unclear and, per the authors, the possibility of 
dysplasia within the bile duct system could not be excluded.
Although BiliSeq did not identify any false positive cases, 
there were 37 (25%) false-negative cases after accounting for 
repeat testing. In order to determine the cause of false-negative 
NGS results, we performed BiliSeq testing on available diag￾nostic pathological material from 12 of these 37 malignancies. A 
genomic alteration in at least one of the 28 genes was detected 
within our molecular panel. Considering the collection of bile 
duct specimens is technically difficult and sampling failures 
are known to occur, inadequate sampling of the stricture may 
be a possible explanation. Alternatively, low specimen tumour 
cellularity may also be a factor. The lowest limit of detection 
for our NGS assay is approximately 3% of mutant alleles or, for 
a heterozygous mutation, such as KRAS, 6% tumour cellularity. 
Therefore, if the fraction of tumour cells was lower than 6%, 
then BiliSeq would be unable to detect a pathogenic genomic 
alteration. While this finding could be viewed as a technical 
constraint, controlling the sensitivity of BiliSeq may be benefi￾cial, especially for specific genes. Previous studies using surgical 
resection material have demonstrated KRAS mutations in cases 
of low-grade biliary dysplasia and benign cholangiopathy.
52
Therefore, increasing the sensitivity of BiliSeq for KRAS muta￾tions may result in a decrease in specificity for at least high￾grade biliary dysplasia. It is also important to emphasise that 
a subset of malignant neoplasms involving the bile duct may 
harbour genomic alterations that are not assayed by our test. 
For example, mutations in chromatin remodelling genes (eg, 
ARID1A) and FGFR2 fusion genes are present in up to 20% of 
intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas.26 30 32–34 Thus, the sensitivity 
of BiliSeq could potentially be improved with target amplifica￾tion/enrichment techniques and an expanded gene panel.
Another intriguing, but preliminary observation, from our 
study is the striking difference in sensitivity between BiliSeq and 
pathological evaluation for at least high-grade biliary dysplasia 
among patients with PSC. PSC is an autoimmune condition and 
associated with a lifetime incidence of cholangiocarcinoma that 
ranges from 6% to 36%.53–56 The risk of cholangiocarcinoma is 
highest within the first 2 years of a PSC diagnosis and suggests 
a possible window of opportunity for early detection.55 57
However, a small cholangiocarcinoma in a background of an 
inflammatory stricture is particularly difficult to sample and 
challenging to diagnose by pathological evaluation. Although the 
number of patients with PSC within our cohort was relatively 
small, the sensitivity of pathological evaluation was only 8%. 
In comparison, BiliSeq achieved an 83% sensitivity for at least 
high-grade biliary dysplasia and provides compelling evidence 
to further explore its potential to improve clinical outcomes for 
this high-risk patient population.
Besides NGS testing, several adjunctive techniques have 
been developed clinically to evaluate bile duct strictures, such 
as digital image analysis, single gene sequencing and multi￾focal FISH for chromosomal polysomy. Among these ancillary 
studies, multicolour FISH has become an adopted tool by many 
academic institutions for over a decade.15 Analogous to BiliSeq, 
the premise of multicolour FISH is the finding that dysplastic 
and malignant neoplasms involving the bile duct are often 
characterised by a high frequency of numerical chromosomal 
abnormalities. However, this test typically achieves sensitivities 
of only 35%–60% with minimal technological improvement 
in the past few years.13 15 18 Multicolour FISH is expensive, 
labour intensive, prone to subjective interpretation errors and 
requires significant technical expertise. In fact, the interpreta￾tion of multicolour FISH requires an experienced pathologist, 
since a paired morphological assessment of the specimen is 
needed to ensure that the epithelial cells of interest are being 
evaluated for chromosomal abnormalities. While we did not 
perform a formal comparison between BiliSeq and multico￾lour FISH, Dudley et al6
 found their NGS assay had a higher 
sensitivity than multicolour FISH. This is not surprising as NGS 
testing detects copy number alterations and single nucleotide 
variants in multiple genes. Furthermore, with decreasing costs 
and the ability to batch multiple specimens in a single run, NGS 
testing has become widely available to both academic and non￾academic institutions. Thus, NGS testing may be a more pref￾erable option than multicolour FISH in the evaluation of bile 
duct specimens. Demonstrating the clinical feasibility of BiliSeq 
to ERCP-obtained biliary specimens also lays the foundation for 
further applications of NGS testing to non-invasive specimen 
types, such as bile and serum (eg, circulating tumour DNA and

In addition to early detection, a major impetus for widespread 
adoption of NGS technologies has been solid tumour geno￾typing. Malignant neoplasms arising or secondarily involving the 
bile duct system are typically recalcitrant and current standard￾of-care chemotherapeutic regimens are associated with limited 
efficacy. On relapse or progression after first-line or second-line 
chemotherapy, comprehensive genomic profiling for a subset of 
tumours has identified alterations that are potentially targetable 
or predictive markers of response to specific therapy.26 28 For 
example, ERBB2 amplification has been reported in intrahe￾patic cholangiocarcinoma, perihilar/distal cholangiocarcinoma 
and gallbladder adenocarcinoma with a prevalence of 5%, 17% 
and 19%, respectively.28 62 Among eight patients with ERBB2-
amplified or HER2/neu-overexpressed gallbladder adenocarci￾noma, Javle et al46 reported three had stable disease, four had 
partial responses and one had a complete response to targeted 
therapy (trastuzumab or trastuzumab with pertuzumab). Of 
note, five of the eight patients received first-line chemotherapy 
or chemoradiation prior to treatment with targeted therapy. 
Within our study, BiliSeq testing identified two patients with 
ERBB2 amplification: one intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma and 
one perihilar cholangiocarcinoma. Both patients received tras￾tuzumab in conjunction with standard first-line chemotherapy 
(gemcitabine and cisplatin), both exhibited measurable radio￾graphic response and normalisation of serum CA19-9, and both 
are currently alive and well. While we recognise the benefits 
of standard chemotherapy, it seems reasonable to assume the

inclusion of trastuzumab within the chemotherapeutic regimen 
to be responsible for the significant and prolonged treatment 
effects observed in both patients. It should also be stressed that 
the identification of a targetable alteration at the time of diag￾nosis facilitated a personalised approach to treatment. More￾over, ERBB2 was not the only genomic alteration detected by 
BiliSeq to potentially confer susceptibility to anticancer therapy.
We acknowledge that there are several limitations to this 
study. Although a large number of bile duct specimens were anal￾ysed, follow-up diagnostic pathology was available for only 66% 
of patients. However, the majority of patients with malignant 
neoplasms involving the bile duct system often have unresectable 
disease at presentation or are poor surgical candidates. In addi￾tion, in order to ensure sufficient DNA for NGS testing, a sepa￾rate bile duct specimen than the specimen used for pathological 
evaluation was used for BiliSeq testing. This protocol may explain 
the incongruent results between pathological evaluation and 
BiliSeq testing for a subset of cases. Furthermore, this study does 
not address the optimal gene panel or approach of integrating 
NGS-based molecular testing to the evaluation of a bile duct 
stricture. To minimise the need for repeat sampling, we routinely 
perform BiliSeq on all patients with potentially malignant stric￾tures at the time of initial ERCP. A positive BiliSeq result hastens 
the referral process for appropriate surgical and/or oncolog￾ical subspecialists. A negative BiliSeq result provides additional 
reassurance to negative pathological evaluation. Because none 
of these diagnostic modalities achieves a sensitivity of >95%, 
few patients can be fully dismissed from surveillance based on a 
negative BiliSeq. A similar approach has been adopted by inves￾tigators using multicolour FISH. It is also important to recognise 
that recent advancements in cholangioscopy and increasing use 
of EUS-FNA may potentially improve the detection of malig￾nant strictures.63 64 While a minority of patients within this study 
were evaluated by cholangioscopy, we found similar diagnostic 
performance characteristics between cholangioscopy and chol￾angiography.65 The application of EUS-FNA to bile duct stric￾tures, especially distal strictures, is reported to enhance tissue 
acquisition over traditional ERCP methods.66 However, patients 
in our study cohort evaluated using both techniques did not 
show any statistically significant differences in sensitivity. In fact, 
BiliSeq yielded a higher sensitivity than ERCP or EUS-FNA alone 
and, in combination with either method, increased the sensitivity 
of detecting a distal malignant stricture to at least 90%. Lastly, 
our definition of targetable genomic alterations is based on an 
aggregation of a myriad of studies. The true clinical utility of any 
given drug to a particular genomic alteration is unknown until 
a prospective clinical trial is performed. However, we were able 
to demonstrate at least anecdotal evidence of clinical benefit by 
pairing genomic alterations, such as ERBB2 amplification, with 
specific anticancer therapy (eg, trastuzumab).
In summary, we report the largest prospective study to 
examine the role of NGS-based molecular (BiliSeq) testing to the 
evaluation of bile duct strictures. Our results support the clinical 
utility of combining BiliSeq to standard pathological evaluation 
of bile duct specimens. Additionally, BiliSeq has the potential 
to identify targetable genomic alterations and, therefore, stratify 
patients for specific chemotherapeutic regimens. Future studies 
are however required to explore the integration of BiliSeq and 
similar NGS-based assays into current surveillance and manage￾ment guidelines for patients with bile duct strictures.
