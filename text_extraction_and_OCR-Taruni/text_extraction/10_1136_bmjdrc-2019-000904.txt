Significance of this study
What is already known about this subject?
► Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is common 
in patients with type 2 diabetes and the EASL-EASD￾EASO guidelines recommend systematic screening 
in this population.
► NAFLD is a risk factor for diabetic complications.
What are the new findings?
► The application of the guidelines to patients with 
type 2 diabetes using sequentially Fatty Liver Index 
(FLI) and Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) would lead to referral to 
hepatologists of 13.4% of patients.
► Biomarkers of steatosis showed an association with 
microalbuminuria, whereas biomarkers of fibro￾sis were associated with cardiovascular and renal 
complications.
How might these results change the focus of 
research or clinical practice?
► Our results show that applying the aforementioned 
guidelines in everyday clinical practice would not 
probably lead to over-referral to hepatologists when 
a combination of FLI and FIB-4 is used.
Abstract
Objective Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is 
prevalent in patients with type 2 diabetes. Here, we estimate 
the proportion of patients with type 2 diabetes that should 
be referred to hepatologists according to the European 
Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL)-European 
Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD)-European 
Association for the Study of Obesity (EASO) Guidelines and 
evaluate the association between non-invasive biomarkers of 
steatosis and fibrosis and diabetic complications.
Research design and methods This is a retrospective 
analysis of type 2 diabetes patients who attended on a 
regular basis our diabetes clinic between 2013 and 2018 
(n=2770). Steatosis was assessed using Fatty Liver Index 
(FLI), Hepatic Steatosis Index and NAFLD Ridge Score and 
fibrosis using NAFLD Fibrosis Score (NFS), Fibrosis-4 (FIB￾4), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) to platelet ratio index 
(APRI) and AST/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ratio. Outcome 
measures were altered albumin excretion rate (AER), chronic 
kidney disease (CKD) and cardiovascular disease (CVD).
Results The prevalence of advanced fibrosis varied from 1% 
(APRI) to 33% (NFS). The application of the guidelines using 
a sequential combination of FLI and FIB-4 would lead to 
referral of 28.3% of patients when using standard FIB-4 cut￾offs, while this number dropped to 13.4% when age-adjusted 
FIB-4 thresholds were applied. A higher prevalence of altered 
AER was associated with liver steatosis (FLI: OR: 3.49; 95%CI 
2.05 to 5.94, p<0.01), whereas liver fibrosis was associated 
with CKD (FIB-4: OR: 6.39; 95%CI 4.05 to 10.08, p<0.01) 
and CVD (FIB-4: OR: 2.62; 95%CI 1.69 to 4.04, p<0.01).
Conclusions While specific fibrosis scores identify different 
proportion of patients with advanced fibrosis, the use of 
age-adjusted FIB-4 cut-offs leads to a drop in gray-zone 
results, making referrals to hepatologists more sustainable. 
Interestingly non-invasive biomarkers were consistently 
associated with a different pattern of diabetic complications.
Introduction
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) 
occurs very commonly in patients with type 
2 diabetes mellitus, with a prevalence of 
55%–68%1
 due to the often superimposable 
condition of insulin resistance.2
 The degree 
of fibrosis represents the strongest predictor 
of liver-specific and all-cause mortality3 4 and 
although most individuals with NAFLD do 
not reach the cirrhotic stage, patients with 
type 2 diabetes seem to progress faster and 
are at higher risk of steatohepatitis (NASH)5 6
and liver-related mortality.7
 For these reasons, 
identifying individuals with, or at higher risk 
for advanced fibrosis among the large NAFLD 
population is clinically useful for the patient 
and challenging for the physician. With 
this purpose the EASL-EASD-EASO Guide￾lines recommend to routinely screen type 2 
diabetes patients for the presence of NAFLD 
and to assess the presence of advanced

fibrosis in high risk individuals.8
 Another reason to iden￾tify patients with NAFLD is that beside its effect on the 
liver, a growing body of evidence showed that this condi￾tion is also associated with an increased incidence of 
cardiovascular (CVD) events,9 10 chronic kidney disease 
(CKD),11 and diabetic microvascular complications such 
as nephropathy, retinopathy11 and sensitive-motor12 and 
autonomic neuropathy.13 In the present study our aim 
was: (1) to test the sustainability in terms of specialist 
referrals of the diagnostic flow-chart proposed by the 
EASL-EASD-EASO Guidelines using sequentially non￾invasive biomarkers of steatosis and fibrosis in patients 
with type 2 diabetes and (2) to explore the association of 
these biomarkers with CVD and CKD morbidity.
Materials and methods
Patients
We retrospectively reviewed medical records of all 
patients aged >18 years with a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes 
who attended on a regular basis our diabetes clinic at 
Policlinico di Monza between 2013 and 2018. Based on 
patients history and available previous medical records 
we excluded from the analysis individuals with secondary 
causes of hepatic steatosis, chronic liver disease (hepatitis 
C, hepatitis B, Wilson Disease, autoimmune hepatitis), 
liver complications (liver failure, ascites, encephalopathy, 
variceal bleeding or hepatocellular carcinoma) or signif￾icant alcohol consumption (evaluated through routine 
nutritional history performed in the diabetes clinic or 
past medical records).
Flow-chart for the screening of NAFLD
The above-mentioned EASL-EASD-EASO Guidelines 
recommend to screen the presence of NAFLD through 
a first step based on the use of ultrasound or serum 
biomarkers to evaluate the presence of liver steatosis.8
When steatosis is identified, they suggest using non￾invasive serum biomarkers to look for liver fibrosis. 
Patients at low risk for advanced fibrosis are followed-up 
every 2 years by repeating liver enzymes and fibrosis 
scores, whereas those at intermediate or high risk need 
to be referred to specialists to exclude other chronic liver 
diseases, to better assess disease severity and possibly to 
initiate specific therapy.
Non-invasive biomarkers of liver steatosis and fibrosis
We estimated the prevalence of liver steatosis using the 
Fatty Liver Index (FLI),14 the Hepatic Steatosis Index 
(HSI)15 and the NAFLD Ridge Score (NRS).16 Risk of 
advanced fibrosis was estimated using the Fibrosis-4 
(FIB-4) score,17 the NAFLD Fibrosis Score (NFS),18 the 
AST/ALT ratio, and the AST to platelet ratio index 
(APRI).19 All scores were calculated as originally described 
(online supplementary table 1).14–19 The proposed cut￾offs were used to identify patients at low, intermediate 
or high probability of advanced steatosis or fibrosis. To 
evaluate their impact in reducing indeterminate results, 
age-adjusted cut-offs for FIB-4 were also calculated, as 
recently proposed.20 In particular a cut-off of 2.0 was used 
to rule out advanced fibrosis in patients aged >65 years.
Definition of CKD and CVD complications
Established cardiovascular disease was defined as a 
composite of coronary artery disease (acute coronary 
syndromes, revascularization procedures or stable 
angina), cerebrovascular disease (previous stroke, tran￾sient ischemic attack, or >35% carotid artery stenosis) 
and peripheral arterial disease requiring revasculariza￾tion. The presence of an altered albumin excretion rate 
(AER) was defined as a urine albumin to creatinine ratio 
>30mg/g. Diabetic retinopathy was diagnosed by dilated 
eye exam performed by an ophthalmologist. Estimated 
glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was calculated from 
the Epidemiology Collaboration (EPI)-CKD equation 
and CKD was defined as an eGFR value less than 60mL/
min/1.73m2
. For the subgroup of patients in primary 
cardiovascular prevention, the risk of coronary heart 
disease (CHD), fatal CHD, stroke and fatal stroke was 
estimated using the 10-year United Kingdom Prospective 
Diabetes Study (UKPDS) Risk Engine V.2.0 algorithm, 
downloaded from Oxford University website: (https://
www.dtu.ox.ac.uk/riskengine/download.php).
Analytical assessments
An interview on disease status, family history of meta￾bolic disorders, personal history of previous diseases 
and pharmacologic therapy was collected on a routine￾basis. Diabetes was diagnosed according to the American 
Diabetes Association criteria. Height (cm), body weight 
(kg), waist circumference (cm), smoking status, systolic 
and diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg) and heart rate at 
resting conditions were obtained at every follow-up visit by 
an experienced nurse. Body mass index (BMI) was calcu￾lated as weight/height (kg/m2
). Metabolic syndrome was 
defined in accordance with the Adult Treatment Panel III 
(ATP III) criteria.21 Plasma levels of glucose, HbA1c, creat￾inine, AST, ALT, Gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT), 
total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, 
triglyceride, platelets, white blood cells and albumin were 
measured by local laboratories. In our daily practice we 
routinely ask for AST, ALT, GGT and a complete blood 
count in all of our patients as screening procedures as 
recommended by the Italian Standards of Care, but we 
do not routinely perform the assessment of total protein 
and electrophoresis, which are necessary for calculation 
of NFS. Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol was calcu￾lated according to Friedwald formula.
Statistical analysis
Analyses were performed using the SPSS software V.20.0. 
Data are expressed as means±SD for continuous variables 
or as numbers and percentages for categorical variables. 
All continuous variables were assessed for approximation 
to the normal distribution by the d’Agostino D-normality 
test.22 Logistic regression was performed to ascertain 
the effects of steatosis and fibrosis scores on macro and

microvascular complications and low probability group

significant.
Results
Anthropometric and metabolic features of the population
A total of 2770 type 2 diabetes patients were included in 
the study. Data for calculating liver steatosis markers were 
available in 1519, 2076, and 1082 for FLI, HSI and NRS, 
respectively. Data for calculating liver fibrosis scores were 
available for 2096, 1429, 1421 and 370 for AST/ALT, 
APRI, FIB-4 and NFS, respectively. To test whether we 
were selecting a priori patients with severe liver disease 
we compared the clinical and metabolic features of the 
entire population with those of patients with available 
scores. These comparisons are summarized in online 
supplementary table 2, showing that these subpopula￾tions did not differ with regards to clinical and metabolic 
features and prevalence of comorbidities. The features 
of these subpopulations did not differ from those of the 
entire cohort of type 2 diabetes patients.
Prevalence of liver steatosis and fibrosis
Figure 1 shows the prevalence of low, intermediate and 
high probability of liver steatosis and fibrosis according 
to each non-invasive marker. High probability of liver 
steatosis was present in the large majority of patients 
based on FLI, HSI and NRS (65%–88%). In contrast 
high probability of advanced fibrosis varied greatly 
according to different biomarkers (from 1% using APRI, 
to 33% using NFS). A large proportion of patients fell in 
the indeterminate zone risk (from 23.1% using APRI to 
55.8% using AST/ALT).

flow-chart of EASL-EASD-EASO guidelines, we analyzed 
the subgroup in which we could calculate both the FLI 
and the FIB-4. This population consisted of 1023 indi￾viduals, whose features were not different from those of 
the entire type 2 diabetes cohort (data not shown). As a 
first step, we used FLI to identify patients with steatosis 
(FLI >60) and found that it was present in 661 patients 
(65%). In the second step, patients with steatosis were 
stratified in those at low, intermediate and high risk of 
advanced fibrosis according to FIB-4 using both standard 
and recently proposed age-adjusted cut-offs23 (figure 2). 
When applying standard FIB-4 cut-offs 289 patients 
(43.7% of those with steatosis, 28.3% of the total popu￾lation) would need to be referred to specialists because 
of either intermediate (n=253) or high (n=36) risk. This 
number decreased to 137 patients (20.7% of those with 
steatosis, 13.4% of the entire population) when age￾adjusted cut-offs were applied (102 patients with inter￾mediate and 35 patients with high risk). If we consider 
only patients at high risk of advanced fibrosis, then the 
percentage of referrals would decrease to 35 patients 
(5.3% of those with steatosis, 3.5% of the total cohort). 
We found similar results using HSI as a steatosis marker 
(data not shown).
Non-invasive biomarkers and diabetic complications
We found a higher prevalence of microalbuminuria in 
patients with an intermediate or high (OR: 3.49; 95%CI 
2.05 to 5.94) category of FLI (table 1).
No significant differences could be detected with the 
other biomarkers of liver steatosis and fibrosis. A higher 
prevalence of diabetic retinopathy was found in patients 
with intermediate (OR: 1.58; 95%CI 1.1 to 2.3) and high 
(OR: 2.68; 95%CI 1.6 to 4.5) category of the AST/ALT 
ratio, whereas there was no association with the other 
biomarkers of liver steatosis or fibrosis.
A higher prevalence of CVD was observed in individ￾uals in the intermediate (OR: 2.0; 95%CI 1.6 to 2.5) and 
high (OR: 2.6; 95%CI 1.7 to 4.0) risk categories for FIB-4 
score and in intermediate (OR: 1.73; 95%CI 1.4 to 2.1) 
and high (OR: 1.86; 95%CI 1.4 to 2.5) categories of the 
AST/ALT ratio (table 1). Only a non-significant trend 
was found with an intermediate and high category of NFS 
and FLI.
A higher prevalence of eGFR <60mL/min was found 
in individuals within the intermediate and high catego￾ries of all biomarkers of fibrosis except for APRI.
Figure 3 shows the cardiovascular risk of patients in 
primary cardiovascular prevention, assessed using the 
UKPDS risk engine, with low, intermediate and high 
levels of FIB-4, AST/ALT and NFS. Those within the lower 
risk of fibrosis showed a reduced risk of coronary heart 
disease (p<0.05), fatal CHD (p<0.03), stroke (p<0.02) 
and fatal stroke (p<0.01). We found no significant trend 
using the APRI score and scores of liver steatosis.
We then compared the clinical and metabolic features 
of cases selected for referral using the FLI-FIB-4 (age￾adjusted) approach with those of entire cohort of patients 
with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Cases selected for referral 
did not differ with regards to age (69±11 vs 68±12, 
p=0.24), but had a higher BMI (33.0±4.9 vs 30.2±5.9, 
p<0.001), were more frequently males (67.2% vs 59.1%, 
p=0.045) and had a higher prevalence of microalbumin￾uria (39.0% vs 29.3%, p=0.021), CKD (38.5% vs 27.1%, 
p=0.002), CVD (54.0% vs 40.4%, p=0.001) and retinop￾athy (26.1% vs 17.8%, p=0.033). As shown in table 2 after 
correcting for sex and BMI, patients selected for referral 
still had a higher prevalence of CVD (OR: 1.86; 95%CI 
1.30 to 2.64, p=0.001) and CKD (OR: 1.78; 95%CI 1.24 to 
2.56, p=0.002) and a positive trend for microalbuminuria 
(OR: 1.49; 95%CI 0.99 to 2.26, p=0.057) and retinopathy 
(OR 1.60; 95%CI 0.97 to 2.66, p=0.065).
Discussion
In the present study we showed that applying the EASL￾EASD-EASO guidelines to patients with type 2 diabetes 
using the sequential combination of two non-invasive 
markers of steatosis and fibrosis (FLI and FIB-4) would 
result in hepatologic referral of 28.3% of patients when 
applying standard cut-offs and that this number signifi￾cantly dropped to 13.4% when recently published 
age-adjusted thresholds were used. Furthermore, we 
found a consistent association between biomarkers of 
liver steatosis and fibrosis and some chronic diabetic 
complications.
Given the increasing prevalence of NAFLD, routine 
referral of all patients to specialized hepatologists would 
not be sustainable and all clinicians are challenged to 
identify the small group of patients having an advanced 
form of the disease. Since liver biopsy is not applicable to 
large populations, readily available non-invasive fibrosis 
tests represent a very attractive option. In this context, 
our study is the largest to date to evaluate the number 
of patients with type 2 diabetes that should be referred 
to hepatologists based on the previously mentioned

Medici Diabetologi annals) with data coming from several 
diabetology clinics. In these studies the authors found a 
similar prevalence of NAFLD using FLI (~60%),24 and, 
in a smaller sample of ~1500 individuals with available 
clinical information, they reported a slightly higher prev￾alence of advanced fibrosis using FIB-4 (12%).25
While we found a great variability in the percentage 
of patients classified as having low–intermediate or high 
risk of advanced fibrosis based on the specific biomarkers 
used, we chose to apply the diagnostic flow-chart using 
FIB-4. FIB-4 and NFS are the two most validated scores 
in the literature as also mentioned in the guidelines.8
Data from the STELLAR trials, the largest studies to 
date on non-invasive tests of liver fibrosis found that 
FIB-4 had a higher Area Under the Receiver Operating 
Characteristics Curve (AUROC) compared with NFS 
and similar diagnostic accuracy when compared with 
more specialized tests such as Enhanced Liver Fibrosis 
(ELF) or Vibration Controlled Transient Elastography, 
especially in patients older than 65, which comprised 
~60% of our population.26 Moreover, even though the 
guidelines do not specify which test to use in specific 
populations, NFS in patients with type 2 diabetes seems 
to identify most of the patients in the intermediate or 
high risk group probably because the variable hypergly￾cemia is included in the formula leading to spectrum 
bias27 and potentially to over-referral. In addition, it also 
requires the assessment of serum albumin concentra￾tion, which is not a routine test to be performed in the 
diabetes clinic.

One of the major limitations of non-invasive scores is 
that many patients fall in a gray zone where the diagnosis 
remains undetermined.28 Here, we tested for the first 
time how much the recently proposed age-adjusted cut￾offs could reduce the number of indeterminate results 
and referrals in a real-life setting. If it is confirmed that 
the change in these cut-offs does not reduce sensitivity, 
while increasing specificity it is our opinion that it could 
confer a large advantage to better classify patients and 
avoid unnecessary referrals.20 In our population this 
resulted in 13.4% of patients with type 2 diabetes to refer, 
which seems to be a reasonable proportion of patients.
Another option to reduce indeterminate results is to 
use sequentially different biomarkers of liver fibrosis. 
Srivastava et al recently applied a two-step strategy in a 
primary care setting in which patients with a FIB-4 in 
the indeterminate range were evaluated using the ELF 
test.23 This approach led to a reduction in indeterminate 
results and in unnecessary referrals to hepatology clinics 
and rescued several patients with significant fibrosis that 
would have been falsely reassured by the FIB-4 score. 
Although the setting was different, a similar approach 
could potentially be more effective than a single step 
algorithm in diabetes clinics as well, although it remains 
to be proven.
Nonetheless an approach which bases referrals only on 
fibrosis stage is likely to miss a subset of patients with NASH 
and early fibrosis, who still need referral to a specialist 
since they are at high risk of developing advanced fibrosis 
or cirrhosis in the upcoming years.29 This underlines 
the need for reliable non-invasive biomarkers of NASH, 
which are still not available in clinical practice.
Our study was also the first to evaluate whether markers 
of liver steatosis and fibrosis are associated with specific

microvascular and macrovascular complications of type 2 
diabetes. Our results show that steatosis (and FLI in partic￾ular) is associated with the prevalence of altered albumin 
excretion rate, even after adjusting for BMI. This is in 
accordance with previous studies showing that insulin 
resistance, which correlates with indices of liver steatosis, 
probably plays an important part in the development 
of diabetic nephropathy30 and mice selectively lacking 
the insulin receptor in the kidney podocytes develop 
albuminuria even in the absence of hyperglycemia.31 In 
contrast with epidemiologic data reporting a higher inci￾dence rate of CVD in patients with ultrasound-diagnosed 
NAFLD,32 we only found a trend between makers of livers 
steatosis and cardiovascular disease. On the other hand, 
our results align with a prospective study in which, after 
adjustment for several covariates, biomarkers of liver 
steatosis were not independently associated with incident 
CVD.33
In contrast, biomarkers of liver fibrosis correlated 
well with the prevalence of CVD and CKD, in particular 
FIB-4, NFS and AST/ALT, confirming similar findings 
reported in the general NAFLD population.34 Consistent 
with these data, we found a higher UKPDS cardiovascular 
risk in the subpopulation of diabetic patients in primary 
cardiovascular prevention.
This study has several strengths including the large 
sample size, a study group that represents the general 
type 2 diabetes population that attends secondary care 
diabetes clinics, the inclusion of both sexes and the good 
quality of data collection. In addition, we chose to eval￾uate hard cardiovascular clinical outcomes rather than 
markers of subclinical organ damage that were already 
described in previous studies.35
We also acknowledge certain limitations that require 
consideration. First, this was a cross-sectional analysis 
based on retrospective chart review and as such the 
present findings reflect an association with prevalent and 
not incident outcomes. Therefore, it does not provide 
evidence of a cause–effect relationship between liver 
steatosis and fibrosis and diabetic complications and 
prospective studies are needed to confirm our findings. 
Second, we used non-invasive score to asses liver fibrosis 
but could not evaluate the actual prevalence with gold 
standard techniques such as liver biopsy. Nevertheless, 
the aim of this study was not to evaluate the ability of 
these scores to predict advanced fibrosis, but to assess 
the feasibility of NAFLD screening in patients with type 
2 diabetes and explore correlations between biomarkers 
and complications. Third, the diagnosis of CKD was 
based on the estimated eGFR calculated with the CKD￾EPI formula, and misclassification of patients may have 
occurred. However, more precise evaluations are time￾consuming and not readily applicable to clinical prac￾tice. Fourth, we did not systematically assess the presence 
of other etiologies of liver disease and the exclusion was 
based on what was reported by the patients or on avail￾able medical records. On the other hand the EASL-EASD￾EASO Guidelines do not recommend the screening of 
these factors in their proposed algorithm8
 but state that 
it should be performed following referral.
In conclusion, while the use of different non-invasive 
fibrosis scores among patients with type 2 diabetes 
identify different proportion of patients with advanced 
fibrosis, the use of age-adjusted FIB-4 cut-offs leads to a 
drop in gray-zone results, making referrals to hepatolo￾gists more sustainable for the healthcare system. Further 
combination with other techniques is likely to further 
reduce indeterminate results, but it still needs validation 
in the diabetologic setting. Interestingly non-invasive 
biomarkers were consistently associated with a different 
pattern of diabetic complications.
