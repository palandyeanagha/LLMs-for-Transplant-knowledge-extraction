Backgrounds/Aims: In the absence of national registry of laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) or its complications, it 
is impossible to determine incidence of bile duct injury (BDI) in India. We conducted an e-survey among practicing 
surgeons to determine prevalence and management patterns of BDI in India. Our hypothesis was that majority of sur￾geons would have experienced a BDI during LC despite large experience and that most surgeons who have a BDI 
tend to manage it themselves. Methods: An 18-question e-survey of practicing laparoscopic surgeons in India was 
done. Results: 278/727 (38%) surgeons responded. 240/278 (86%) respondents admitted to a BDI during LC and 
179/230 (78%) affirmed to more than one BDI. A total of 728 BDIs were reported. 36/230 (15%) respondents experi￾enced their first BDI even after ＞10 years of practice and 40% had their first BDI even after having performed ＞100 
LCs. 161/201 (80%) of the respondents decided to manage the BDI themselves, including 56/99 (57%) non-biliary 
surgeons and 44/82 (54%) surgeons working in non-biliary center. 37/201 (18%) respondents admitted to having a 
mortality arising out of a BDI; the mortality rate of BDI was 37/728 (5%) in this survey. Only 13/201 (6%) respondents 
have experienced a medico-legal case related to a BDI during LC. Conclusions: Prevalence of BDI is high in India 
and occurs despite adequate experience and volume. Even inexperienced non-biliary surgeons working in non-biliary 
centers attempt to repair the BDI themselves. BDI is associated with significant mortality but litigation rates are for￾tunately low in India. (Ann Hepatobiliary Pancreat Surg 2020;24:469-476)

INTRODUCTION
Laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) has become stand￾ard surgical treatment for gallstone disease. There is a wide 
range (0.5% to 1.5%) of incidence of BDI during LC,1,2
compared to 0.3% for open cholecystectomy (OC).3
 Inci￾dence (number of BDIs divided by number of LCs) data 
is available from countries in Europe and USA where 
population and registry data is available.2,4 With a pop￾ulation of about 1.3 billion, a large number of LCs are 
performed in India. It is not possible to document inci￾dence of BDI since there is no national registry of LC 
or its complications. Prevalence (number of surgeons who 
had a BDI divided by number of surgeons doing LC) data 
is available from surveys in many western and developed 
countries including USA,5
 Canada,6
 Italy,7
 Sweden,8
 UK,9
Japan, Korea and Taiwan,10 but there are no studies from 
low-middle income countries (LMIC), including India. 
We conducted an e-survey amongst practicing surgeons 
to find out prevalence and management patterns of BDI 
in India. We hypothesized that majority of surgeons in 
India continue to experience a BDI during LC even after 
adequate experience with LC. We also hypothesized that 
most surgeons who have a BDI tend to manage it them￾selves.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Questionnaire
An anonymous e–survey was developed using Survey 
MonkeyⓇ, an online survey development cloud-based soft￾ware (www.surveymonkey.com). 17 questions were closed 

470 Ann Hepatobiliary Pancreat Surg Vol. 24, No. 4, November 2020 www.ahbps.org
type (multiple choices) and 1 was free response type (open 
ended). The questions were self-explanatory, but any doubts 
raised by the respondents were clarified by the authors on 
email/over phone. Four professors reviewed the questions 
and confirmed them to be representative of the content 
validity of the survey. The survey was filled twice by dif￾ferent individuals to identify errors in wording, grammar 
or syntax. The ‘Logics’ feature on Survey MonkeyⓇ al￾lowed the respondents to skip to a specific question based 
on their answer to a previous close-ended question. The 
respondents could skip the questions they didn’t want to 
answer or change their answers before the final submis￾sion. The average survey response time was five minutes. 
Internet Protocol addresses were checked to avoid dupli￾cation of responses.
Four questions aimed to establish the nature of practice 
of the surgeon viz. private setup, corporate hospital or in￾stitute-based practice (Q 1) and the experience with LC 
(Q 2) and whether the respondent surgeon is a biliary or 
non-biliary surgeon (Q 16), working in a biliary or non￾biliary center (Q 17). The respondents were then asked 
if they have ever had a post-cholecystectomy BDI (Q 3) 
and whether they have had more than one BDI (Q 4). We 
asked them to report a BDI during LC either done by 
them or supervised by them and not to include BDIs oc￾curring in the hands of other surgeons/units and referred 
to them for definitive management. Respondents who ad￾mitted to a BDI during LC were then taken through ques￾tions to ascertain number of years of laparoscopic surgery 
experience (Q 5) and number of LCs (Q 6), specifically 
prior to their first BDI. Responses were obtained regard￾ing associated bilio-vascular injury (BVI) (Q 7), use of 
intraoperative cholangiography (IOC) (Q 8), time of de￾tection of BDI (intraoperative, postoperative or follow-up) 
(Q 9), respondent’s role in the operating team in the LC 
i.e. chief operating surgeon, assisting senior surgeon as 
junior colleague, assisting junior surgeon as senior col￾league or leader of operating team (even if not scrubbed 
in the case) (Q 10), choice of management (self-manage￾ment or referral) (Q 11), management strategy (Q 12),any 
BDI during laparoscopic converted to open or open chol￾ecystectomy (Q 13), any mortality related to BDI (Q 14) 
and any medico-legal litigation arising out of the BDI (Q 
15). The last question (Q 18) was a text-based question 
which aimed to collect similar information regarding sub￾sequent BDIs. The questionnaire is attached (Supplement 
1). 
In order to attain uniformity we used the following def￾initions; these were explained to the respondents on phone/ 
email, in case they had any doubts.
Bile duct injury
1. Unexplained intraoperative visualization of bile.
2. Visualization of bile in the drain placed intraoper￾atively.
3. Visualization of bile in a percutaneous catheter drain 
(PCD) placed postoperatively.
4. Surgical obstructive jaundice due to benign biliary 
stricture (BBS).
Biliary surgeon
A surgeon who performs elective hepatico-jejunostomy 
on a regular and frequent basis.
Biliary center
A facility where infrastructure and expertise for inter￾ventional radiology, therapeutic endoscopy and biliary re￾constructive surgery are available.
Survey population
The senior author (VKK) emailed members of Uttar 
Pradesh State Chapter of Association of Surgeons of India 
(UPASI), Society of Endoscopic and Laparoscopic Surgeons 
of India (SELSI), faculty members in institutions offering 
superspecialty training programs in surgical gastroentero￾logy and alumni of our department over last three decades 
explaining the purpose of the survey. The respondents were 
invited to click on the embedded question or the hypertext 
link, which invoked the web browser and presented the 
web-based questionnaire. Once completed by the respon￾dents, the questionnaires were transmitted anonymously to 
the sender. Responses were received by email in a format 
which enabled transfer to Microsoft Excel and SPSS. The 
respondents were assured of complete anonymity and in￾formed that their responses would be collated for analysis 
for presentation/ publication; no incentives were offered. 
The eligible participants were given 5 weeks’ to complete 
the questionnaire from 24. 4. 2020 till 30. 5. 2020. 
Exemption from review was obtained from the institu￾tional ethics committee (2018-62-IP-EXP) of Sanjay Gandhi

RESULTS
A total of 2,916 emails were sent, 727 persons opened 
the survey and we received 179 responses over email and 
99 responses via the web link. The overall response rate 
of survey was 278/727 (38%). 
Fig. 1 shows the demography of surgical practice of re￾spondents (Q 1). 132/278 (47%) respondents had more than 
15 years of experience in LC (Q 2). 102/201 (51%) were 
biliary surgeons (Q 16) and 119/201 (59%) worked in a 
biliary center (Q 17). 
As many as 240/278 (86%) of respondents had experi￾enced at least one BDI in their practice (Q 3) and 179/230 
(78%) affirmed to more than one BDI (Q 4). Fig. 2 de￾picts breakup of the number of BDIs experienced by 
respondents.
Majority i.e. 141/230 (61%) experienced their first BDI 
within 5 years of their laparoscopy career, while 36/230 
(15%) experienced a BDI even after being in practice for 
＞10 years (Q 5). Fig. 3 shows number of LCs performed 
by respondents before the first BDI (Q 6). BVI during 
BDI was reported by 14/201 (7%) respondents (Q 7). 
Only 11/201 (5%) routinely use intraoperative cholangiog￾raphy (IOC) at their centers (Q 8). Fig. 4 shows time of 
detection of the first BDI; 196/201 (97%) of the re￾spondents identified a BDI as bile leak either on-table or 
in the drain and only 5/201 (2%) reported it manifesting 
as a benign biliary stricture on follow up (Q 9). The first 
BDI occurred in the hands of 125/201 (62%) respondents 
when they were the operating surgeon. The respondent

was assisting a senior surgeon in 39 (19%) instances, as￾sisting a junior surgeon in 12 (6%) and was not scrubbed 
(but was the team leader) on 25 (12%) occassions (Q 10). 
161/201 (80%) of the respondents decided to manage the 
BDI themselves and only 40/201 (20%) referred the pa￾tient to another center (Q 11). Fig. 5 lists the management 
strategy used by respondent surgeons (Q 12). Table 1 
shows a comparative analysis between respondents who 
opted to manage their BDI on their own vs. those who 
referred the patient to a higher center with regard to their 
nature of surgical practice, number of prior LC performed, 
satisfying criteria of a biliary surgeon and working in a 
biliary center as outlined in the questionnaire. Table 2 
compares the specific type of management strategy of the 
BDI chosen by various groups of surgeons. 86/201 (43%) 
respondents had had a BDI in laparoscopic converted to 
open or open cholecystectomy also (Q 13). 37/201 (18%) 
respondents admitted to having a mortality arising out of 
a BDI (Q 14); these 37 deaths occurred in a total of 728 
BDIs reported in the survey, resulting in a mortality rate 
of 5% in this survey. 13/201 (6%) respondents have expe￾rienced a medico-legal case related to a BDI in their own 
hands (Q 15).
NOTE Not all numbers tally as all respondents did not 
answer all the questions. 
DISCUSSION
Our web based survey, probably the first of its kind 
from India, showed that most of the respondents had ex￾perienced a BDI and most had experienced more than one 
BDI during LC in their career. Moreover, most of the in￾juring surgeons preferred to manage the BDI themselves 
and very few referred the patient to higher center for de￾finitive management of the BDI. BDI was associated with 
significant mortality but litigation rate was not very high.
The response rate in our survey was 38% which com￾pares with 43% in UK survey,9
 45% in US survey,5

in Italian survey,7
 61% in a multi-national survey10 and 
75% in Canadian survey.6
 A confidential mail-out ques￾tionnaire to gauge surgeons’ perspective on BDI during 
LC had a response rate of 75%, but received only 114 
completed responses.6
 An anonymous retrospective multi￾center questionnaire-based survey mailed to 316 heads of 
surgical units had a response rate of 58% and reported 
on 235 BDIs.7
 Our web-based survey had 278 responses 
from practicing surgeons who reported a total of 728 BDIs.
Although there are several surveys on prevalence of 
BDI, most include small number of respondents. The 
Swedish survey interviewed 76 surgical departments 
which had reported a BDI,8
 Canadian survey included 114 
surgeons,6
 British survey included 117 respondents9
 and 
in Italian survey, only 184 heads of surgical units 
responded.7
 We received responses from 278 surgeons; 
other surveys with larger number of respondents are the 
multi-national survey of 372 surgeons from Japan, Korea 
and Taiwan10 and US survey of 1,661 surgeons.5
Prevalence of BDI in our survey was 86% (78% for 
more than one BDI). Most surgeons tend to exaggerate 
their successful results and understate complications. Since 

474 Ann Hepatobiliary Pancreat Surg Vol. 24, No. 4, November 2020 www.ahbps.org
ours was a self-reported survey (and not an external audit) 
of a surgical complication, we believe actual prevalence 
rates are even higher. We had greater (42%) participation 
from surgeons in teaching hospitals, half were biliary sur￾geons and more than 85% had ＞5 years’ experience with 
LC. The general/laparoscopic surgical community which 
performs majority of LCs is likely to have more non-bili￾ary surgeons working in non-biliary centers i.e. nursing 
homes or private hospitals. Prevalence of BDI is likely 
to be even higher in their hands than in our sample. 
The 86% prevalence of BDI in our survey compares 
with 79% in Swedish survey,8
 72% (BDIs and near miss￾es) in multi-national survey10 and 69% in Italian survey7
but is much higher than 53% prevalence in the Canadian 
survey,6
 45% in UK survey9
 and 27-38% in US survey.5
Experience of surgeon is no protection against BDI dur￾ing LC. While 60% of BDIs in our survey occurred dur￾ing first 5 years of laparoscopic surgical practice, so-called 
‘learning curve’,12 as many as 15% of our respondents re￾ported their first BDI after 10 years in practice. About 
40% of respondents had performed more than 100 LCs 
before their first BDI. This has been reported earlier too. 
One-third of 65 BDIs in Belgium occurred in the hand 
of experienced surgeons.13 In Canada, almost two-thirds 
of surgeons experienced a BDI after 100 cholecystecto￾mies.6
 Similarly, 30% of the BDIs reported from Spain 
occurred when the surgeon had performed over 200 
cases.14 In USA too, one-third of 704 BDIs occurred in 
hands of surgeons who had performed ＞200 LCs.5
 These 
observations indicate that so called ‘learning curve’ in 
LC15 is a myth14 and BDIs reflect fundamental errors in 
technique of LC rather than experience.5,16,17 A national 
multicenter questionnaire survey in Italy, sent to 316 heads 
of surgical units, did not identify risk factors in 80% of 
BDIs and half of these occurred during LCs described as 
“technically easy”. Hence no cholecystectomy can be con￾sidered as a simple routine procedure, immune to the risk 
of BDI.7
 In survey from Japan, Korea and Taiwan,10 au￾thors found prevalence rate of BDI reached ＞80% among 
surgeons who had performed ＞1,000 cases.
We included bile leak as BDI in our questionnaire ac￾cording to Strasberg’s classification (Types A, C and D).18
Most surveys from West, citing decreasing incidence of 
BDI following LC, have identified BDI as only those bili￾ary injuries which needed surgical intervention thus miss￾ing out those injuries which were managed by drainage 
with or without endoscopic stenting.5,19 Others have in￾cluded only those BDIs which were treated at same center 
where LC was done, missing out on injuries managed at 
other centers.20 Moreover, even so-called minor BDIs can 
cause severe morbidity and death. Academic Medical Center, 
Amsterdam, Netherlands, reported a total of 800 BDIs, 
216 of these were Strasberg Type A injuries, but mortality 
in these 216 cases was as high as 9/216 (4.2%).21
Only 2.5% of our respondents reported BBS subsequent 
to BDI. Bile leaks (on-table or postoperatively in the drain) 
are more likely to be remembered by the surgeon and hence 
reported as BDI. Patients having a complication like BBS 
following LC are likely to go elsewhere than to injuring 
surgeon. Tertiary level referral hospitals in India report 
large number of post-cholecystectomy BBS.22,23
More than 2/3rd of our respondents, many of whom 
were non-biliary surgeons working in non-biliary centers, 
opted to manage the BDI on their own, including on-table 
repairs and RYHJ. Some of these may have been minor 
injuries which could be managed with simple measures. 
It could also reflect mentality of the injuring surgeon to 
“fix the leak” then and there and thus avoid postoperative 
morbidity and litigation related to bile leak. This is world￾wide experience,8
 despite suggestions of better outcomes 
if the patient is referred to a higher center.24 While imme￾diate repair (end-to-end repair over T tube or RYHJ) by 
a biliary surgeon may be acceptable, it is not recom￾mended for a non-biliary surgeon working in non-biliary 
center e.g. nursing home or private hospital to repair a 
BDI. Such attempts are rarely successful, cause more 
(higher) injury to the bile duct, can cause vascular injury 
and thus make future repair challenging even for biliary 
surgeon.25 Immediate repair by the injuring general/lapa￾roscopic non-specialist surgeon in the injuring hospital it￾self is one of the risk factors for litigation being filed and 
decided against the surgeon.26
Associated BVI was reported by 7% of surgeons. This 
probably reflects on-table assessment based on intraopera￾tive blood loss. Most surgeons would not routinely do 
vascular evaluation (e.g. Doppler, CT angiography or MR 
angiography), especially in setting of acute BDI. Figures 
quoted in literature for BVI vary from 0.25%27 to 36%28
depending on method used for documentation. 
BDI can cause mortality due to uncontrolled intraabdo-

Supriya Sharma, et al. Indian bile duct injury survey 475
minal and systemic sepsis. We recorded a mortality of 5% 
(37 deaths in a total of 728 BDIs). Since ours is a self-re￾ported survey by a very select group of surgeons and not 
a longitudinal study, the actual figures can be even higher. 
Way back in 1994, Gouma and Go29 reported mortality 
of 7.8% in 77 patients with BDI. In another report from 
India, Mishra et al.30 reported 6 deaths in 137 patients 
with BDI. It was 3.5% in a single large institution 
(Academic Medical Center, Amsterdam, Netherlands) expe￾rience of 800 BDIs.31 BDI also increases life-time risk of 
biliary-related death. In a recent analysis of 711,454 chol￾ecystectomies in USA, patients with bile leak were more 
likely (2.4% vs. 1.4%) to die at one year than those who 
did not and those with BDI were more likely (7.2% vs. 
1.3%) to die at one year than those who did not.1
Fortunately, litigation rates for BDI during LC are low 
in India. Only 6% of responding surgeons had medi￾co-legal cases filed against them for BDI caused during 
LC. This is much lower prevalence than reported from 
other countries. In a report from the Great Britain and 
Ireland, 22% of 117 respondents reported a medico-legal 
experience following LC.9
In this web-based survey of surgeons, probably first 
such from India a LMIC, we found most surgeons have 
had at least one BDI during LC. BDI occurred even in 
the hands of “experienced” biliary surgeons. Many non￾biliary surgeons working in non-biliary centers still at￾tempt to repair the BDI themselves, contrary to the rec￾ommendations of various guidelines. BDI carries sig￾nificant risk of death; mortality of BDI in this survey was 
5%. BDI resulted in litigation against the surgeon though 
the rates were lower than in the West.
