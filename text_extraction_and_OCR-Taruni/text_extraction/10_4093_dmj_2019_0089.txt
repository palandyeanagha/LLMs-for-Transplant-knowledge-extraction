Background: Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) has been only reported to prevent type 1 diabetic nephropathy (DN) in the 
streptozotocin-induced type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) mouse model. However, the FVB (Cg)-Tg (Cryaa-Tag, Ins2-CALM1) 
26OVE/PneJ (OVE26) transgenic mouse is a widely recommended mouse model to recapture the most important features of 
T1DM nephropathy that often occurs in diabetic patients. In addition, most previous studies focused on exploring the preventive 
effect of FGF21 on the development of DN. However, in clinic, development of therapeutic strategy has much more realistic value 
compared with preventive strategy since the onset time of DN is difficult to be accurately predicted. Therefore, in the present study 
OVE26 mice were used to investigate the potential therapeutic effects of FGF21 on DN. 
Methods: Four-month-old female OVE26 mice were intraperitoneally treated with recombinant FGF21 at a dose of 100 µg/kg/day 
for 3 months. The diabetic and non-diabetic control mice were treated with phosphate-buffered saline at the same volume. Renal 
functions, pathological changes, inflammation, apoptosis, oxidative stress and fibrosis were examined in mice of all groups.
Results: The results showed that severe renal dysfunction, morphological changes, inflammation, apoptosis, and fibrosis were ob￾served in OVE26 mice. However, all the renal abnormalities above in OVE26 mice were significantly attenuated by 3-month FGF21 
treatment associated with improvement of renal adenosine 5´-monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activity 
and sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) expression. 
Conclusion: Therefore, this study demonstrated that FGF21 might exert therapeutic effects on DN through AMPK-SIRT1 pathway.

INTRODUCTION
According to the epidemiology of kidney disease in the United 
States, diabetic nephropathy (DN) is one of the most serious 
complications of diabetes throughout the world, with 40% of 
the end-stage renal diseases (ESRD) caused by it [1]. The main 
pathological features of DN are glomerular hypertrophy, accu￾mulation of extracellular matrix, mesangial broadening and

basement membrane thickening. The changes of glomerular 
filtration barrier and proteinuria lead to glomerular sclerosis 
and renal interstitial fibrosis, resulting in end-stage renal dis￾ease [2]. 
The currently used anti-antidiabetic drugs usually cause se￾vere side effects such as edema and hypoglycemia [3]. Howev￾er, fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 21, a member of the FGF 
family, possesses a potentially metabolic therapeutic outlook 
in the clinic because of its astounding non-proliferative, non￾edema- and non-hypoglycemia-causing safety natures [3]. 
Studies showed that type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) with re￾nal abnormalities always displayed higher serum FGF21 levels 
[4,5]. In addition, Wei et al. [6] demonstrated that elevated en￾dogenous FGF21 in kidney could prevent the development of 
DN induced by T2DM. And accumulated studies elucidated 
that administration of exogenous FGF21 played a significant 
role in preventing T2DM-induced renal abnormalities as char￾acterized by attenuating renal inflammation, apoptosis, oxida￾tive stress, fibrosis, and insulin resistance [7,8]. Up to date, all 
the renal protective effect induced by FGF21 belongs to pre￾ventive effect. However, in the clinic, it is difficult to identify 
the onset time of DN since most patients do not display abnor￾mal clinical symptoms during this period [9]. Therefore, there 
is a realistic clinical value to develop therapeutic strategy of 
FGF21 against DN compare to preventive strategy.
Adenosine 5´-monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein ki￾nase (AMPK) is highly expressed in the kidney which plays an 
important role in regulating glucose and lipid metabolism 
[10,11]. Strong evidence demonstrated that the progression of 
DN is associated with impaired renal AMPK activation (phos￾phorylation) [12,13]. Additionally, activation of AMPK reduc￾es the production and accumulation of collagen and fibronec￾tin in the kidney of DN mice [12]. Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) is an 
NAD+-dependent lysine deacetylase which is involved in a 
wide range of physiological functions, including control of 
gene expression, metabolism and aging [14,15]. Reduced 
SIRT1 expression was observed in both renal proximal tubules 
(PTs) and podocytes in diabetic mice, which finally contribut￾ed to albuminuria [13]. Moreover, Papadimitriou et al. [16] 
demonstrated that maintenance of SIRT1 expression and ac￾tivity is beneficial for the kidney under DN condition. As we 
know, both AMPK and SIRT1 are the classic downstream ki￾nase of FGF21. Strong evidence demonstrated that FGF21 
suppressed diabetes-induced tissue damages in several tissues 
by activation AMPK-mediated pathway [17,18]. In addition, 
SIRT1 is required for FGF21-induced protection on heart and 
testis under diabetic condition [18,19]. 
Although approximately only 10% diabetic patients belongs 
to type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), the incidence of DN is 
higher than T2DM patients, approximately one-third of them 
will develop DN over the course of their lifetime [20]. Al￾though our previous study confirmed that administration of 
exogenous FGF21 attenuated the renal damage in T1DM mice 
[21], the study was considered as preventive study since mice 
received FGF21 treatment once T1DM was diagnosed. 
In the present study we mainly focus on identifying the hy￾pothesis that FGF21 induces therapeutic effect on DN and the 
underling mechanisms. In order to verify the hypothesis, FVB 
(Cg)-Tg (Cryaa-Tag, Ins2-CALM1) 26OVE/PneJ (OVE26) 
mice which spontaneously induced T1DM were applied in the 
present study. OVE26 is a commonly recommended mouse 
model for DN study since it can ideally mimic DN in human 
[22]. Four-month-old female OVE26 were treated with FGF21 
(100 μg/kg/day) for 3 months. 
Renal functions, pathological changes, inflammation, oxida￾tive stress, apoptosis, and fibrosis were explored to evaluate the 
therapeutic effect of FGF21 on DN. Additionally the impact of 
FGF21 on renal AMPK and SIRT1 pathway was also identified 
to dissect the mechanism of FGF21-induced renal protection 
against DN.
METHODS
Animals
The Friend Virus B NIH Jackson (FVB/NJ) background of trans￾genic T1DM mouse model FVB (Cg)-Tg (Cryaa-Tag, Ins2-
CALM1) 26OVE/PneJ (OVE26) has been used in our previous 
study [23]. OVE26 mice usually experience serious hypergly￾cemia before 3 weeks of age and severe albuminuria by four￾month old. Since Xu et al. [24] have found that OVE26 female 
mice exhibit more severe albuminuria than male mice, 4-month￾old female diabetic OVE26 mice that generated severe albu￾minuria were separated into two groups at random: one group 
was set as the untreated diabetic group (diabetes mellitus [DM],
n=10) and the other group was defined as FGF21-treated dia￾betic group (DM/FGF21, n=6). Four-month-old female non￾diabetic FVB/NJ mice were set as the control (FVB/NJ, n=9). 
For DM/FGF21 mice, recombinant human FGF21 (Wenzhou 
Medical University, Zhejiang, China) was applied intraperito￾neally at a dose of 100 µg/kg/day for 3 months started at 4

months of age. Non-FGF21-treated mice received the equiva￾lent volume of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). All of the ani￾mals were taken care of under specialized pathogen-free cages 
in which they can easily obtain food and water through a 12-
12 hour day-night cycle, in coordination with the approved 
protocols and guidelines of the care and use of laboratory ani￾mals and Wenzhou Medical University Animal Policy and 
Welfare Committee (IRB number: SYXK2015-0009, Zhejiang, 
China). At the final checkpoint (7 months old) (Fig. 1A) after 
the measurement of body weight, euthanasia was performed 
followed by the acquisition of blood samples and kidney tissue. 
Tibia length and kidney weight of mice in all groups were mea￾sured. Finally, kidneys were stored in liquid nitrogen for future 
analysis of protein and RNA, as well as for pathological tests.
Histopathological examination and immunohistochemistry
Kidney tissue was fixed in 10% phosphate-buffered formalin 
for 24 hours. Then, after dehydrated in graded alcohol and so￾lutions, the tissue was embedded in paraffin and cut into 5-um 
thick sections for pathological and immune-histochemical 
staining. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining was used for 
general morphological detection, while periodic acid-Schiff 
(PAS) staining and picrosirius red staining were used for glo￾merulosclerosis and renal collagen accumulation. For immu￾nohistochemistry, slides were heated for antigen retrieval fol￾lowed by treatment with different primary antibodies, respec￾tively, including Wilms tumor (WT1, 1:1,000) purchased from 
Santa Cruz Biotechnology; CD68 (1:200, Abcam, Cambridge, 
UK), CD3 (1:200, Abcam) overnight at 4°C. After washing for 
four times with PBS, the slides were incubated with biotin-la￾beled secondary antibodies (1:500, Abcam) for 2 hours at 
room temperature. Finally, after 5 washes of PBS, DAB (3, 
3-diaminobenzidine, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, 
USA) was applied for color development. All of the images 
were analyzed with Image Pro Plus 6.0 software (Media Cyber￾netics, Rockville, MD, USA).
TUNEL assay
The sections were treated with 3% hydrogen peroxide for 30 
minutes at room temperature followed by proteinase K for 40 
minutes at 37°C. After that the slices were incubated with reac￾tion reagent containing TdT and digoxigenin-conjugated 
dUTP for 60 minutes at 37°C. Meanwhile, reaction reagent 
without TdT was applied to a negative control. DAB was then 
applied to display the color of the stained index.
Detection of plasma FGF21
Blood samples were collected in a lithium heparin tube (BD) 
immediately after euthanasia and centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 
15 minutes at 4°C to isolate plasma. The plasma FGF21 level 
was measured using the human FGF21 Quantikine Elisa kit 
(R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) according to the 
manufacturer’s instructions and protocols.
Evaluation of renal function
Blood samples were collected in a lithium heparin tube (BD) 
immediately after euthanasia and centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 
15 minutes at 4°C to isolate plasma to measure the plasma cre￾atinine. After treatment with FGF21 for 1 and 3 months, the 
mice were individually placed into a metabolic cage to collect 
24-hour urine samples for examining renal function parame￾ters including the urine albumin and urine creatinine.
24-Hour urine albumin: Urine albumin was detected accord￾ing to the manufacturers’ instructions and protocols (Bethyl 
Laboratories, Montgomery, TX, USA).
Urine creatinine: Urine creatinine was examined using Quan￾tiChrom Creatinine Assay Kit (DICT-500) from Bioassay sys￾tems (Hayward, CA, USA).
Plasma creatinine: Plasma creatinine was examined accord￾ing to the manufacturers’ instructions and protocols of Serum 
Creatinine Detection Kit (Arbor Assays, Ann Arbor, MI, USA).
Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was calculated according to 
the following formula: 
GFR=(total creatinine μg from 24 hours urine)/(plasma 
creatinine concentration μg/μL)/(24 hours×60 min/hr)
Lipid peroxidation
Measurement of renal Malondialdehyde (MDA): The concen￾tration of MDA was detected by thiobarbituric acid (TBA) acid 
assay as an index of lipid peroxidation, as previously described 
[25].
Western blot assay
Kidney cortex tissues were crushed in lysis buffer with a ho￾mogenizer and centrifuged at 12,000 g at 4°C for 10 minutes 
(Beckman GS-6R; Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA). Protein 
concentration was measured by the Bradford assay. After being 
diluted in loading buffer and denatured at 95°C for 5 minutes, 
the samples were separated in 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gele￾lectrophoresis (10% SDS-PAGE) followed by being transferred 
into nitrocellulose membranes for separation. After blocking

Real-time qPCR 
RNA and cDNA were extracted according to the manufactur￾er’s protocol from Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA

Master Mix (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) as 
previously described [26]. TaqMan primers for SIRT1 and 
β-actin control primer were purchased from Applied Biosys￾tems (Carlsbad, CA, USA).
Statistical analysis
Data from repeated experiments are presented as mean±SD. 
PAS staining and picrosirius red staining were identified by 
Image Pro Plus 6.0 software and Western blot data were ana￾lyzed by Image Quant 5.2 software (GE Healthcare Bioscienc￾es). Comparisons were performed by analysis of variance 
(ANOVA) for the different groups, followed by post hoc pair 
wise repetitive comparisons using LSD test with SPSS data 
analysis (IBM SPSS Statistics version 19.0; IBM Co., Armonk, 
NY, USA). Statistical significance was considered as P<0.05.
RESULTS
The impact of FGF21 on body weight, blood glucose and 
renal function in DN mice
Elevation of body weight of mice during the FGF21-treated 
period of all of the groups was comparable (Fig. 1B). Hypergly￾cemia was stably observed not only in PBS-treated OVE26 
mice (DM group), but also in FGF21-treated OVE26 mice 
(FGF21/DM group), indicating that FGF21 at the dose of 100 
ug/kg/day had no glucose-lowering effect (Fig. 1C). As the key 
index reflecting renal function, the 24-hour urinary albumin 
assay suggested that DN was diagnosed in 4-month-old 
OVE26 mice based on the significant increase in urinary albu￾min compared to the FVB group (Fig. 1D). And urinary albu￾min was further enhanced in both 1- and 3-month PBS-treat￾ed OVE26 mice. However, treatment with exogenous FGF21 
for both 1 and 3 months notably reduced 24-hour urinary al￾bumin (Fig. 1D). The result of GFR demonstrated that GFR of 
OVE26 mice was significantly increased compared with FVB 
mice at the age of 7 months while FGF21 improved the GFR 
after 3 months treatment (Fig. 1E), suggesting that FGF21 in￾duced a beneficial effect on improving renal function in 
OVE26 mice. The survival curve showed that the FGF21 im￾proved the viability of OVE26 mice (Fig. 1F). Similarly, the ra￾tio of renal weight to tibia length was strongly increased in DM 
group, which was slightly, but significantly decreased by sup￾plement of exogenous FGF21 (Fig. 1G). Additionally, ELISA 
results showed that plasma rhFGF21 was remarkably higher in 
FGF21/DM group than that in DM group (Fig. 1H), indicating 
that exogenous FGF21 was indeed injected into the mice. 
FGF21 treatment attenuated diabetes-induced renal 
pathological changes in OVE26 mice
To identify the impact of FGF21 on renal pathological changes, 
H&E staining (Fig. 2A and B), PAS staining (Fig. 2C and D), 
and picrosirius red staining (Fig. 2E and F) were performed in 
this study. H&E staining and PAS staining showed that renal 
structure abnormalities of OVE26 mice were more severe than 
those of FVB mice with the characters of glomerular hypertro￾phy, thickened glomerular basement membranes as well as 
mesangial matrix expansion and mesangial cells proliferation 
(Fig. 2A-D), which were attributed to glomerular sclerosis. 
However, all these abnormalities were attenuated after 3-month

FGF21 treatment (Fig. 2A-D). Picrosirius red staining was ap￾plied to examine the accumulation of collagen, which is a 
marker of interstitial fibrosis. As shown in Fig. 2E and F, picro￾sirius red positive staining area in the renal tissue of 3-month 
PBS treatment OVE26 mice is larger than that in FVB mice, 
indicating that significant renal fibrosis existed in 3-month 
PBS treatment OVE26 mice. In contrast, 3-month-treatment 
of FGF21 notably induced an anti-fibrotic effect characterized 
by reducing the positive area of picrosirius red staining (Fig. 
2E and F). The anti-fibrotic effect of FGF21 in the diabetic kid￾ney was further confirmed by the reduced content of fibrotic 
markers including fibronectin (FN) (Fig. 2G and H), CTGF 
(Fig. 2G and I), and α-SMA (Fig. 2G and J) compared with 
PBS-treated OVE26 mice. Increasing evidence demonstrated 
that glomerulopathy was mainly attributed to podocyte. Addi￾tional immunohistochemistry staining showed that the ex￾pression of WT1, a specific marker of podocyte, was signifi￾cantly reduced in 3-month PBS treatment OVE26 mice, which 
was dramatically reversed by FGF21 supplement (Fig. 2K and 
L), implying that podocyte is a protective target of FGF21 un￾der DN condition.
The impact of FGF21 on renal inflammation, apoptosis 
and oxidative stress in the diabetic kidney of OVE26 mice
Inflammation, apoptosis, and oxidative stress are the main 
pathogeneses of diabetes-induced renal damage, which were 
examined in the present study. The results showed the expres￾sion of multiple pro-inflammatory factors including TNF-α
(Fig. 3A and B), CD68 (Fig. 3A and C) and ICAM (Fig. 3A and 
D) significantly increased in the kidney of 3-month PBS treat￾ment OVE26 mice indicating severe renal inflammation situa￾tion existed. Renal inflammation was further confirmed by in￾creased content of CD68 (Fig. 3E and G) and CD3 (Fig. 3F and 
H) examined via immunohistochemistry staining. However, 
all the abnormally elevated inflammatory markers above in the 
diabetic kidney were attenuated by 3-month FGF21 treatment 
(Fig. 3), indicating that FGF21-induced renal therapeutic ef￾fect was associated with the attenuation of renal inflammation. 
Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick 
end labeling (TUNEL) staining showed the number of apop￾totic cells was significantly increased in 3-month PBS treat￾ment OVE26 mice (Fig. 4A and B), which was notably sup￾pressed by 3-month FGF21 treatment (Fig. 4A and B). More￾over, FGF21-induced anti-apoptotic effect was further con￾firmed by the ratio decrease of BAX to BCL-2 (Fig. 4C and D). 
Unexpectedly, although oxidative stress is regarded as one of 
the important inducers and markers of DN, in the present 
study elevated oxidative stress was only observed in plasma. 
Result of plasma MDA (Fig. 5A) showed that plasma MDA 
was significantly increased in 3-month PBS-treated OVE26 
mice. Unfortunately, FGF21 failed to restore it. However, ele￾vated oxidative stress was not observed in the kidney of 
3-month PBS-treated OVE26 mice due to the unchanged ex￾pression of classic oxidative markers, including kidney MDA 
(Fig. 5B), 3-NT (Fig. 5C and D), 4-HNE (Fig. 5C and E). The 
expression of HO-1 (Fig. 5C and F) and NQO-1 (Fig. 5C and 
G) was remarkably increased while CAT expression (Fig. 5C 
and H) was reduced in the kidney of 3-month PBS treatment 
OVE26 mice. Moreover, diabetes did not affect renal SOD2 ex￾pression (Fig. 5C and I). Among them, we only found that re￾nal HO-1 expression had fallen back to the control level after 3 
months of treatment with FGF21 (Fig. 5C and F). 
FGF21-induced renal therapeutic effect against DN might 
be through activation of the AMPK-SIRT1 pathway
In Fig. 6, we demonstrated that diabetes down-regulated but 
FGF21 maintained ERK1/2, P38, AMPK phosphorylation in 
OVE26 mice (Fig. 6A-D). Additionally, we found both reduced 
mRNA level of SIRT1 (Fig. 6E) and SIRT1 expression (Fig. 6A 
and F) in the kidney of 3-month PBS treatment OVE26 mice 
were reversed by treatment of FGF21 for 3 months, indicating 
AMPK and SIRT1 might be involved in FGF21-induced renal 
therapeutic effect against DN. We also examined the phosphor￾ylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 
(STAT3) which is considered to be the downstream of p-AMPK 
[27,28]. The results showed that the elevation of p-STAT3 in the 
kidney of 3-month PBS treatment OVE26 mice was reversed by 
treatment of FGF21 for 3 months (Fig. 6A and G).
DISCUSSION
DN is characterized by glomerular hypertrophy, accumulation 
of extracellular matrix, mesangial broadening and basement 
membrane thickening. The changes of glomerular filtration 
barrier and proteinuria lead to glomerular sclerosis and renal 
interstitial fibrosis, resulting in end-stage renal disease [2,29]. 
In comparison with the traditional anti-diabetic drugs in clin￾ics, studies show that FGF21 is considered to be a safer drug 
because of its non-proliferative, non-edema- and non-hypo￾glycemia-causing natures [3,30]. Emerging evidence shows

Therapeutic effect of FGF21 on type 1 diabetes mellitus nephropathy

that FGF21 induces preventive effect on DN [7,31]. However, 
in the clinic, it is difficult to identify the onset time of DN since 
most patients have no clinical symptoms at the early stage of 
DN [9]. Therefore, how to design a preventive strategy using 
FGF21 is still unclear. Compared to preventive strategy, de￾signing therapeutic strategy of FGF21 against DN is possible, 
realistic and meaningful. Based on that, 4-month-old OVE26 
mice, which normally spontaneously induce T1DN, were ap￾plied in the study since the OVE26 mouse is considered as the 
most suitable model to mimic human T1DM-induced DN, es￾pecially the late-stage DN in clinic with the characteristic of 
persistent proteinuria, mesangial matrix expansion, and inter￾stitial fibrosis [22,32]. Our previous work demonstrated that 
FVB mice treated with FGF21 showed no side effect in kidney 
[21]. Therefore, there are only three groups applied in this 
study. As expected, the results showed that obvious DN symp￾toms was observed in 3-month PBS treatment OVE26 mice 
characterized by albuminuria, glomerular hypertrophy, thick￾ened basement membrane, mesangial matrix expansion, and 
mesangial cells proliferation, as well as an increase in renal in￾flammation, apoptosis, and fibrosis. However, the above symp￾toms of DN in OVE26 mice were significantly attenuated by 
FGF21 treatment for 3 months at the dose of 100 μg/kg/day, 
indicating, for the first time, that FGF21 induces a therapeutic 
effect on DN in OVE26 mice. We chose the dose of 100 μg/kg/
day because our previous studies demonstrated that recombi￾nant FGF21 synthesized by ourselves exerted preventive effects 
on diabetic mice [17,21]. Therefore, we continue to use this 
dose to explore whether FGF21 plays a therapeutic role on DN 
in OVE26 T1DM mice. 
Although the plasma MDA was significantly elevated in DM 
mice, FGF21 failed to reduce it. Plasma MDA may be directly 
affected by hyperglycemia and lipotoxicity; but FGF21 is not 
an antioxidant so that it is unable to directly affect its changes. 
In addition, plasma MDA may include the portions released 
from all organs; but FGF21 may not actually distribute in all 
organs so that overall FGF21 fails to improve the plasma oxi￾dative stress situation, but the overall outcome is to protect the 
kidney. Furthermore, there was no apparent oxidative stress 
damage in the kidney of 7-month-old OVE26 mice. The possi￾ble explanations include the following points. (1) Under the 
circumstance of DN, long-term adaptive response was induced 
in the kidney with the evidence of upregulated antioxidants, 
including HO-1, and NQO-1 to scavenge the excessive free 
radicals. However, in the present study another important an￾tioxidant, CAT, was decreased in the 3-month PBS treatment 
diabetic kidney, implying that under DN condition, different 
antioxidant was mediated by different signaling which has dif￾ferent response to DN. (2) Besides the antioxidant property, in 
recent years, HO-1 was confirmed to possesses a pathogenic 
property of aggravating chronic inflammation [33,34]. Strong 
evidence demonstrated that moderate expression levels of 
HO-1 induced beneficial effects in cell survival, while excessive 
expression levels of it triggered negative effects [35]. In our 
study, renal HO-1 expression was extremely induced in the 
kidneys of 3-month PBS treatment OVE26 mice, implying that 
severe inflammation might exist in the diabetic kidney. 
Based on the identified therapeutic effect of FGF21 on DN, 
we next dissected the underlying mechanism. As we know, 
AMPK is a crucial factor associated with the regulation of glu￾cose and lipid metabolism [10,11]. Strong evidence demon￾strated that hyperglycemia negatively regulated the activity of 
AMPK which could suppress the onset and progress of DN 
characterized by decreasing the expression of collagen and fi￾bronectin in DN [36]. Additionally, growing evidence indi￾cates that AMPK-mediated signaling pathway is always in￾volved in FGF21-induced beneficial effects in several tissues 
under diabetic condition [17,18,37]. Our previous study indi￾cated that administration of exogenous FGF21 induced anti￾apoptotic effect via increasing ERK1/2, p38MAPK, AMPK 
phosphorylation in diabetic hearts [17].
SIRT1 is involved in multiple activities, such as various cel￾lular processes including apoptotic, inflammatory changes, 
and energy efficiency [14,15]. Moreover, reduced SIRT1 ex￾pression was observed in both renal PT and podocytes in dia￾betic mice, which finally contributed to albuminuria [13,38]. 
Another study demonstrated that aging was accompanied by 
the reduction of SIRT1 expression in podocytes, which result￾ed in podocytes loss, albuminuria, and glomerular abnormali￾ties [39]. Growing evidence demonstrated that FGF21 exerted 
positive functions on various damages through activation of 
SIRT1-mediated pathway [40,41]. Furthermore, FGF21 was 
reported to be involved cardiomyopathy via SIRT1 in T1DM 
mice according to our previous work [19].
Accumulated evidence has demonstrated that AMPK and 
SIRT1 are always involved in the same signaling pathway medi￾ating FGF21’s biofunction [42,43]. It is reported that FGF21 has 
a protective effect on diabetes-induced damages via AMPK￾SIRT1 in different tissues [18,37]. Another study showed that 
FGF21 activated the phosphorylation of AMPK, through

578 Diabetes Metab J 2020;44:566-580 https://e-dmj.org
which SIRT1 became elevated and subsequently induced vari￾ous metabolic pathways in diabetic adipocytes [37]. Nerstedt 
et al. [27] demonstrated that AMPK inhibited inflammatory 
response by suppressing phosphorylation of signal transducer 
and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3). In the present study, 
renal AMPK activity and SIRT1 expression were significantly 
decreased in DN mice which were notably reversed by FGF21 
treatment while the elevation of p-STAT3 in DN mice was re￾versed by exogenous FGF21, implying that AMPK-SIRT1 
might be required for FGF21 to induced renal protection such 
as anti-inflammation against DN.
Although FGF21 has been reported to exert protective ef￾fects on experimental models [7,21], it is reported that elevated 
serum FGF21 is associated with human T2DM, adverse lipid 
profiles, obesity, metabolic syndrome, impaired glucose toler￾ance, and hypertension [44]. The possible explanations may be 
attributed to the followings. (1) Elevating studies demonstrate 
that these individuals may have FGF21 resistance, similar to 
the phenomenon of insulin resistance in these clinical condi￾tions [44,45]. (2) Serum FGF21 may exhibit compensatory ele￾vation under damage state in clinic. However, experimental 
models are usually applied with FGF21 immediately when they 
develop renal damage, resulting in positive effect of FGF21 on 
the diseases. 
Here, we assumed that the therapeutic impact of FGF21 on 
T1DN was mediated by its regulation of the AMPK-SIRT1 
pathway. Therefore, FGF21 has potential as a therapeutic drug 
for diabetic individuals who have developed DN.
