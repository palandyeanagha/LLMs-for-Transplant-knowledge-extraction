Introduction
The efficiency and function of the left ventricle (LV) as a 
pump are represented as systole and diastole. The systolic func￾tion is energy dependent; the diastolic function is an important 
part of cardiac output (as preload) and also includes active pro￾cesses such as the suction effect, which is also energy dependent 
and can be weakened by ischemia [1,2]. Thus, diastolic dysfunc￾tion (DDf) is an early marker of ischemia, because it is sensitive 
to impaired perfusion [3,4].
Most physicians pay attention to the LV ejection fraction 
(EF) for systolic function in the preoperative echocardiographic 
evaluation of patients about to undergo surgery; however, LV 
DDf is often overlooked in such cardiac risk evaluation. LV DDf, 
and even diastolic heart failure (DHF), are usually not signifi￾cant problems in the daily life of patients who do not suffer from 
exercise intolerance, dyspnea, or pulmonary edema. However, 
when they reach the ward after an operation, they often end up 
in the intensive care unit (ICU) with unstable vital signs in com￾Review Article
Anesthesiologists frequently see asymptomatic patients with diastolic dysfunction or heart failure for various surgeries. 
These patients typically show normal systolic function but abnormal diastolic parameters in their preoperative echocar￾diographic evaluations. The symptoms that are sometimes seen are similar to those of chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease. Patients with diastolic dysfunction, and even with diastolic heart failure, have the potential to develop a hyper￾tensive crisis or pulmonary congestion. Thus, in addition to conventional perioperative risk quantification, it may be 
important to consider the results of diastolic assessment for predicting the postoperative outcome and making better de￾cisions. If anesthesiologists see female patients older than 70 years of age who have hypertension, diabetes, chronic renal 
disease, recent weight gain, or exercise intolerance, they should focus on the patient’s diastologic echocardiography indi￾cators such as left atrial enlargement or left ventricular hypertrophy. In addition, there is a need for perioperative strate￾gies to mitigate diastolic dysfunction-related morbidity. Specifically, hypertension should be controlled, keeping pulse 
pressure below diastolic blood pressure, maintaining a sinus rhythm and normovolemia, and avoiding tachycardia and 
myocardial ischemia. There is no need to classify these diastolic dysfunction, but it is important to manage this condition 
to avoid worsening outcomes.

bination with pulmonary edema, which are not responsive to the 
normal use of intravenous (IV) epinephrine or norepinephrine. 
This can lead to poor outcomes, caused by LV DDf regardless 
of LV systolic dysfunction (SDf), with hemodynamic instability 
developing due to surgery-induced adrenergic stimulation and 
anesthesia-induced sympathetic attenuation [5], resulting in a 
lengthy stay in the ICU or even death.
In American Heart Association-American College of Cardi￾ology (AHA-ACC) guidelines, LV DDf is still underestimated 
in preoperative risk assessment and few clinical data supporting 
its importance are available [6]. In particular, such patients need 
more appropriate anesthetic management to prevent postop￾erative complications and to aid in recovery from anesthesia. 
Because overlooking patients with LV DDf or LV DHF during 
the perioperative period, regardless of LV systolic function, can 
be very dangerous and cause poor outcomes, it is important that 
anesthesiologists are familiar with the pathophysiology, manage￾ment, and surgical outcomes and are able to notice their pheno￾typic characteristics, and diagnostic parameters.
Definitions
Regardless of LV systolic function and the patient’s symp￾toms, DDf indicates impaired filling of the ventricles at low 
pressure and abnormalities in diastolic distensibility, filling, 
or relaxation, which are usually associated with hypertension, 
diabetes, or ischemia [7]. The diagnosis of DDf can come from 
cardiac catheterization and Doppler patterns of LV diastolic fill￾ing. DDf shows increased LV diastolic pressure (> 16 mmHg) 
with preserved systolic function and LV volume [8]. DDf itself 
is a physiological or preclinical state that can be compensated 
for with an increase in left atrial pressure, so there is essentially 
an asymptomatic period. In addition to echocardiographic or 
angiographic evidence, when accompanied by symptoms and 
signs that can be confused with chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease such as exercise intolerance, exertional dyspnea, and 
pulmonary edema with normal EF, it could be considered DHF 
[9,10]. DHF is also characterized by a stiff and thickened ven￾tricle, with a small cavity and low cardiac output. About half of 
congestive heart failure cases have a normal EF. DHF can also 
show a normal EF; this is called heart failure with a normal ejec￾tion fraction (HFnEF) or preserved EF (HFpreEF) [11]. How￾ever, DDf can also accompany SDf (Table 1).
Epidemiology
In preclinical DDf, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, coronary 
artery disease, and renal dysfunction are prevalent. In one study, 
the 2-year cumulative probability of developing any symptom 
was as high as 31% and the probability of cardiac hospitaliza￾tion was 21% [12]. Asymptomatic DDf is generally common in 
patients without heart failure, increases with age, and is particu￾larly seen in elderly women with hypertension and hypertrophy 
of the ventricle [13]. DDf alone can predict worse outcomes in 
patients and their prognosis worsens according to its increas￾ing degree [13]. Moreover, more than half of all patients with 
heart failure have a normal EF [14,15]. Compared to SDf, the 
incidence and prevalence of DDf are increasing [14,16], and 
in geriatric patients in particular, it can cause hospitalization, 
increasing hospital costs [17], and even mortality [15]. A study 
of two cohorts of patients with decompensated heart failure 
showed that 35% had preserved LV EF and that they were el￾derly and mainly women [18]. Phillip et al. [19] reported that 
~60% of elderly patients with normal EF presenting for geriatric 
cardiac and non-cardiac surgery had LV-filling abnormalities. 
Moreover, ~15% of these patients had moderate to severe DDf 
in the absence of symptoms. In patients undergoing high-risk 
vascular surgery, DDf is common, 43% [20]. DHF increased 
proportionally with age, up to 70% in those aged > 70 years [21]. 
There are also age-related changes in the cardiovascular system 
including coronary artery disease, systemic hypertension, and 
hypertrophic or infiltrative cardiomyopathy. The effects of these 
conditions can also increase filling pressure due to abnormalities 
in relaxation and decreased compliance of the LV [8].
Pathophysiology
Diastole can be divided into four stages: isovolumetric ven￾tricular relaxation, rapid passive ventricular filling, diastasis, 
and atrial contraction [22]. These can also be subdivided into 
early and late phases. In the isovolumetric relaxation period, 
after mitral valve closure, calcium is sequestered back into the 
sarcoplasmic reticulum; this is an active process for the suction 
effect, which needs adenosine triphosphate (ATP) [7]. In DDf, 
the breakdown of this process causes the ventricle to fail to relax 
and become stiff/less compliant. This dysfunction can be caused 
by impaired LV compliance, a passive process, or by changes in

LV active relaxation [7].
Anatomical diastole occurs from aortic valve closing to mi￾tral valve closing, but at the molecular level, relaxation of the LV 
starts during the early systolic period, because it starts with the 
dissociation of actin-myosin cross bridges [23]. This indicates 
that relaxation and contraction are intimately coupled. Because 
LV segmental and atrio-ventricular synchronization are indis￾pensable in guaranteeing effective relaxation, loss of the atrial 
kick in atrial fibrillation not only changes LV filling but also 
slows myocardial relaxation [24]. Before Doppler-derived vari￾ables, the gold-standard measurement of LV diastolic function 
was the invasive measurement of LV pressures using cardiac 
catheterization [25]. This can show pressure/volume loops, LV 
pressure decline, and the time constant of isovolumetric relax￾ation (τ). DHF patients typically show a significant increase in τ 
[26]. In pressure/volume loops, LV DDf shows a diastolic loop 
(compliance curve) shifted to the left and upwards. In such cas￾es, LV end-diastolic volume is normal but end-diastolic pressure 
is increased, resulting in pulmonary congestion. However, SDf 
causes the end-systolic slope to shift to the right and downwards 
[7] (Fig. 1). In active diastole with isovolumetric relaxation, 
which is energy dependent, abnormalities in relaxation can be 
caused by myocardial ischemia, hypertension, aortic stenosis, 
and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. In contrast, passive diastole 
can be impaired by increased stiffness of the LV chamber, caused 
by an infiltrative disorder (amyloidosis), myocardial fibrosis, and 
progression from impaired relaxation.
Age-related changes in the cardiovascular system can be 
condensed into a reduction of cardiovascular reserve, which 
includes increased arterial and myocardial stiffness, impaired 
β-adrenergic responsiveness and LV relaxation, and reduced 
sinus nodal function and baroreceptor responsiveness [8,27]. 
Aging is related to ventricular and arterial stiffness, which 
increase and exacerbate myocardial oxygen consumption for 
cardiac output [28,29]. Apoptotic myocytes are not replaced, but 
decrease in number with an increased amount of connective tis￾sue matrix. The afterload causes increased arterial stiffness that 
affects LV relaxation [30], resulting in ventricular hypertrophy 
to preserve systolic function [29]. Age-related arterial stiffening 
has two important consequences: decreased aortic distensibil￾ity and increased pulse wave velocity [31,32], which result in 
higher pulse pressure (PP) and prolonged systolic contraction 
[33,34], respectively. Increased PP is an established cardiovas￾cular risk factor [35-38] and the early reflected wave, because 
of prolonged systolic contraction, impinges on early diastole, 
which can cause greater myocardial stroke work, wall strain, and 
oxygen consumption such as a mistimed intra-aortic balloon 
pump. Beyond this, impaired calcium homeostasis and reduced 
β-receptor responsiveness also cause LV DDf. At the cellular 
level, reduced sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum calcium 
ATPase 2 (SERCA2) activity and increased phospholamban ac￾tivity contribute to impaired LV diastolic function [39-41]. The 
signal dampening of β-receptors may be due to receptor down￾regulation or diminished coupling of β-receptors with intracel￾lular adenylate cyclase activity [42-44]. Consequently, despite 
increased circulating catecholamines, there is a limited increase 
in heart rate and contractility in response to endogenous and 
exogenous catecholamines, so there is impaired baroreflex con￾trol of blood pressure (BP). Apoptosis, fibrosis, fatty infiltration, 
and calcification of pacemaker and His-bundle cells can result in 
conduction block, sick sinus syndrome, and arterial fibrillation, 
with loss of the atrial kick for preload in the end-diastole stage 
[5]. Arrhythmias (e.g., atrial fibrillation) and myocardial isch￾emia affecting diastolic timing can decompensate pre-existing 
DDf further. Tachycardia shortens diastole and can impair LV 
filling. Treatment with β blockers or calcium channel blockers 
has been recommended to control tachycardia or arrhythmias to 
improve LV filling [45,46].

phenotypic characteristics such as being elderly women and hav￾ing peripheral edema, hypertension, and obesity. They also tend 
to have limitations in functional capacity caused by reduced 
chronotropic, vasodilator, and cardiac reserve. In addition to a 
functional capacity evaluation, risk factors and phenotypes for 
heart failure should be checked in the preoperative assessment 
for DDf because a heart failure history alone is associated with 
increased morbidity and mortality after non-cardiac surgery [27] 
(Table 2).
Biomarkers of DDf are important as prognostic parameters 
in patients with myocardial ischemia, atrial fibrillation, aortic 
stenosis, and general heart failure. Cardiac catheterization can 
show increased ventricular diastolic pressure (> 16 mmHg) with 
preserved systolic function and normal ventricular volumes in 
DDf [8]. Beyond the analysis of pressure/volume curves from 
cardiac catheterization, echocardiographic assessment of dia￾stolic function becomes very important in perioperative risk 
stratification, surgical care, and anesthetic management of pa￾tients undergoing operations [10]. However, before considering 
echocardiographic findings, the different application of variables 
in transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) and transesophageal 
echocardiography (TEE) in the outpatient clinic from intraop￾erative TEE should be acknowledged because of differences in 
the postures of patients and their ventilation status, as well as 
the effects of anesthetic drugs [47]. The classification and as￾sessment of DDf comes from the initial, transmitral flow (TMF) 
examination with a pulsed-wave Doppler (PWD)-based evalua￾tion of LA and LV filling and its abnormalities, according to cur￾rent guidelines. However, because of the known limitations of 
the rigid application of conventional Doppler indices [22,48-50], 
the most recent guidelines no longer recommend determining 
E and A waves on TMF with PWD as the initial step in the deci￾sion for grading DDf with normal LV EF [51]. New guidelines 
based on TTE have been simplified and focus on the increase in 
left atrial pressure (LAP) rather than grading diastolic dysfunc￾tion. In patients with normal LV EF, more than half of the fol￾lowing should be positive to determine the presence of DDf: av￾erage E/E’ > 14, lateral E’ < 10 cm/s, tricuspid regurgitation (TR) 
velocity > 2.8 m/s, and LA volume index > 34 ml/m2
. In patients 
with depressed LV EF and with normal LV EF but myocardial 
disease, the mitral inflow ratio and the criteria above are used 
for evaluating LAP and grading DDf (Table 3).

Some Doppler variables are valuable for the assessment of 
myocardial diastolic function including TMF with PWD (E/A 
wave, deceleration time [DT], A duration), pulmonary venous 
inflow with PWD (S/D, atrial reversal [Ar]), tissue Doppler 
image (TDI) with PWD (E’/A’ wave), and transmitral color 
M-mode (TMF propagation velocity [Vp]), usually on mid￾esophageal (ME) four-chamber and ME long-axis views. Con￾ventionally, the LV filling pattern of TMF (E and A wave, E/A 
ratio) and DT are most commonly used in echocardiographic 
examinations regarding DDf, but these, along with pulmonary 
venous flow patterns, are dependent on preload variation and 
heart rate and rhythm disturbances [52,53]. In this regard, the 
patient’s preload can be reduced using nitroglycerin (NTG) 
or with the use of the Valsalva maneuver in an awake state (or 
reverse Trendelenburg position or a prolonged lung recruit 
maneuver in a patient under general anesthesia) potentially un￾masking an E, A pattern and impaired relaxation to discriminate 
normal from a pseudo-normal state [8].
In contrast, tissue Doppler imaging of the mitral annulus is 
considered a more sensitive tool in the assessment of DDf, in 
which measurements of E’ indicate the myocardial velocity, and 
not blood flow velocity. E’ may be influenced by preload varia￾tion in the normal heart [54], but becomes preload-independent 
in a heart with DDf [55]. The abnormal range of E’ values is also 
influenced by age: an E’ < 10 cm/s in those < 50 years and E’ < 8 
in those > 50 [54]. The value of E’ is higher at the lateral annulus 
than the septal annulus, because the motion of the lateral annu￾lus is freer than that of the septal annulus due to the surround￾ing structures.
It is convenient to use the lateral E’ in intraoperative TEE and 
the septal E’ in TTE [56,57]. Measurements of E’ represent the 
early diastolic active relaxation phase, but do not represent LV 
compliance for which the E/E’ ratio (the ratio of the transmitral 
E wave velocity to the mitral annular velocity) normalizes early 
transmitral LV filling to mitral annular motion. This is used to 
estimate mean left atrial pressure, with values > 15 representing 
elevated filling pressures and < 8 reflecting normal filling pres￾sures [56,58,59]. With a ratio between 8 and 15, other Doppler 
variables should be considered to estimate LV filling pressure. 
This measurement has been considered accurate and relatively 
independent of LV systolic function, rhythm abnormalities, LV 
hypertrophy, and functional mitral regurgitation [58,60-62].
The prediction of LV filling pressure using Doppler mo￾dalities is important in patients with DDf. Elevated LV filling 
pressures may be the most important factor in poor outcomes, 
rather than merely the presence of delayed relaxation [63]. After 
cardiac surgery, it can also predict a prolonged ICU/hospital stay 
and mortality independently of systolic function [58,64]. When 
evaluating diastolic function with echocardiographic tools, 
measurements should be performed multiple times, considering 
multiple Doppler variables (Table 4).
According to these echocardiographic variables, based on 
TEE, it might be suggested that predictors for increased peri￾operative cardiovascular risk would include E/A of 1–2, DT of 
150–200 ms, E’ < 8 cm/s, E/E’ > 15, Vp < 40 cm/s, an enlarged 
LA, and LV hypertrophy in TTE. In fact, TDI is of limited use in 
analyzing regional wall motion abnormalities; however, there are 
some recent advances in color TDI, such as strain, strain rate, 
speckle tracking, and velocity vector imaging [65,66] that may 
allow a better appreciation of LV filling dynamics and a more 
accurate classification of diastolic function.
Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and N-terminal proBNP (NT 
proBNP) are recognized as specific markers of heart failure (HF) 
with acute dyspnea [67] and are elevated in both HFpreEF and 
HF with reduced HF (HFrEF) [50]. These markers tend to be 
higher in HFrEF than HFpreEF, but do not distinguish HFpreEF 
from HFrEF effectively [68,69]. Suggested levels for a diagnosis 
of acute HF are BNP > 100 pg/ml or NT proBNP > 300 pg/ml 
[70], which are independent predictors of adverse cardiovascu￾lar events in HFpreEF [71]. BNP values should be considered in 
association with other confounding factors. Other reasons for 
elevated BNP factors include renal failure and pulmonary hy￾pertension, caused by lung disease, and obesity, which decrease 
BNP levels. However, even a normal level does not rule out HF￾preEF [72,73].

Perioperative Management
As mentioned above, it is important not to overlook patients 
with asymptomatic LV DDf in the preoperative evaluations, and 
risk factors for heart failure should also be considered. Although 
not specific to geriatric patients, the latest ACC/AHA guide￾lines [6] should be used for the perioperative care of cardiac 
patients undergoing general surgery, and if needed, preopera￾tive cardiovascular risk factors should be evaluated and treated 
by cardiologists. In ischemic heart disease-related procedures, 
bare-metal stenting can be performed with dual anti-platelet 
therapy for 4–6 weeks. Statins should not be discontinued before 
surgery. Because the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system plays 
an important role in the development of DHF and particularly 
in myocardial remodeling and fluid retention, angiotensin￾converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor antagonists, 
and aldosterone antagonists have been proposed for treatment 
[74]. As aforementioned mentioned, drugs for the treatment of 
pre-existing heart failure, arrhythmias, hypertension, and isch￾emic heart diseases (e.g., diuretics, β-blockers, calcium channel 
blockers, antiplatelet agents) should be maintained during the 
perioperative period.
The principles of anesthetic management for patients with 
DDf must be addressed on a case-by-case basis. In addition to 
standard monitoring tools, monitoring the volume status in 
these patients is important, because they are very sensitive to 
volume changes due to surgical bleeding and sympathetic tone 
changes due to anesthesia in the perioperative period. Thus, 
instituting an arterial cannula is necessary for invasive arterial 
monitoring, indirect assessments of preload by stroke volume 
variance, and frequent blood sampling; the timing of each 
should be based on experience and local practice. In major or 
vascular surgery, central venous catheterization, pulmonary 
artery catheterization, and/or TEE may be needed, which can 
contribute to evaluating intravascular volume during anesthesia.
During anesthesia, patients with DDf or DHF are com￾monly elderly and may have hemodynamic instability because 
of general and regional anesthesia disturbing the baseline sym￾pathetic tone, thereby leaving the patient with a higher resting 
sympathetic tone and altered β-receptor sensitivity. In addi￾tion, the frequent use of diuretics due to pre-existing diseases, 
a reduction in the thirst response in the elderly, and age-related 
renal function changes can aggravate the reduction of preload, 
increasing the sensitivity to volume status. Moreover, direct ef￾fects of anesthetics on cardiac inotropy and lusitropy as well as 
arterial and venous vasodilation cannot be ignored with regard 
to unstable hemodynamics either. The choice of regional versus 
general anesthesia is still debated and there are no definitive 
recommendations either way. However, epidural anesthesia is 
preferable to spinal anesthesia because of slower hemodynamic 
changes from the slow onset time and the smooth removal of 
sympathetic tone. In addition, for general anesthesia, IV induc￾tion and maintenance with balanced anesthesia of volatile agents 
and opioids are recommended. 
There are limited clinical data on the effects of anesthetic 
drugs on diastolic function. Sevoflurane during spontaneous 
ventilation preserves diastolic relaxation better than propofol, 
but there are no differences between them regarding diastolic 
function during positive pressure ventilation through balanced 
anesthesia [75]. The common volatile agents (sevoflurane, des￾flurane, isoflurane), IV anesthetics (propofol, midazolam), and 
opioids (morphine, remifentanil) have no significant effects on 
diastolic performance in healthy people, unlike some animal 
models [76,77]. However, in high-risk DHF patients, anesthesi￾ologists should avoid acute changes in hemodynamic load con￾ditions, heart rate, and myocardial oxygen balance. To achieve 
this, a 30–50% reduced dose of induction agents should be used, 
followed by waiting for their delayed effects due to the reduced 
cardiac reserve and slower circulation time, as well as titrating 
the anesthetics. Hypoxia, hypercarbia, and pulmonary hyperten￾sion should also be prevented.
Intraoperative BP control is important, in that systolic BP 
must be within 10–20% of the baseline value and PP should be 
kept below the diastolic BP. An increased PP increases ventricu￾lar wall stress, alters ventricular contraction time, and impairs 
early diastolic filling, increasing the cardiac workload. The “Rule 
of 70s” is useful for controlling BP: age > 70, diastolic BP > 70, 
HR = 70, and PP < 70. Given the effects on cardiac work by 
controlling PP, the combined use of low-dose NTG (0.5–4 μg/
kg/min) and phenylephrine titration (from 0.25 μg/kg/min) is 
applicable and helpful, but either agent alone can worsen hemo￾dynamics. This protocol preserves vascular distensibility, and 
prevents reductions in preload and coronary perfusion pressure, 
thereby maintaining stroke volume with minimal cardiac work 
[8].
In the postoperative period in patients with known DDf, 
hypoxemia and/or atrial fibrillation are the most common com￾Table 5. Perioperative Precipitating Factors for Diastolic Heart Failure

plications, because restored vascular sympathetic tone due to 
emergence and resolution from general or regional anesthesia 
causes a volume shift to central blood volume. The subsequent 
volume overload can result in pulmonary edema and/or atrial 
fibrillation due to decompensation. Because these events can 
happen acutely in a patient with an initially stable appearance, 
continued and careful monitoring are essential. Maintenance of 
NTG at a low dose (25 μg/min) is also useful for the pulmonary 
vasculature, and it is important to avoid the risk factors that pre￾dispose patients to HF (Table 5). Among these factors, a hyper￾tensive crisis can be managed with sound anesthetic practices, 
planning for appropriate postoperative analgesia, preventing 
shivering by control of body temperature during the operation, 
and using IV calcium channel blockers (nicardipine, diltiazem) 
and high doses of IV NTG.
Specific drugs with positive lusitropic effects are often in￾valuable in circulatory failure related to DDf and include phos￾phodiesterase III inhibitors (milrinone) and calcium channel 
sensitizers (levosimendan) [7], both of which are inodilators. 
Milrinone has inotropic, vasodilatory, and lusitropic (particularly 
in a heart failure state) effects with minimal chronotropy, by 
increasing calcium ion uptake in the sarcoplasmic reticulum. It 
can be used at a bolus dose of 50 μg/kg over 10 min and an infu￾sion of 0.375–0.75 μg/kg/min [7,11]. Levosimendan sensitizes 
the contractile elements to calcium and has positive inotropic 
effects, modulating the interaction between troponin and cal￾cium. It also has vasodilatory effects by opening ATP-sensitive 
potassium channels and improving both systolic and diastolic 
functions. 
Conclusions
DDf of the LV and DHF with preserved EF are not rare pa￾thologies, but are frequently underestimated. In the preopera￾tive evaluation of asymptomatic patients undergoing high-risk 
surgery, echocardiographic assessment of LV diastolic function 
should be included in cardiovascular assessments, as should 
consideration of the risk factors for DHF. Early detection of 
and not overlooking preclinical LV diastolic dysfunction can be 
useful for the choice of appropriate surgery, appropriate BP con￾trol, timely monitoring tools, and proper volume management 
to maintain normovolemia on a case-by-case basis. Although 
anesthesiologists may not appreciate the stages of DDf, those 
who are involved in the perioperative care of these patients with 
cardiovascular disorders need to be able to manage them appro￾priately. Because there is not yet an evidence-based treatment 
of choice regarding acute decompensated DHF, its management 
should focus on resolving known precipitating factors such as 
myocardial ischemia, hypertensive crisis, arrhythmias, and pul￾monary congestion.
