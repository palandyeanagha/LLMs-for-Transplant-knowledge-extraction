Abstract
Ischemia reperfusion (I/R) injury is an unavoidable event occurring during heart transplantation, leading to graft failures and
lower long-term survival rate of the recipient. Several studies have demonstrated that microRNAs (miRNAs) are vital
regulators of signalling pathways involved in I/R injury. The present study aims to quantify the altered expression levels of
miRNA and mRNA upon I/R injury in a mouse heart transplantation model, and to investigate whether these miRNA can
regulate genes involved in I/R injury. We performed heterotopic heart transplantation on mouse models to generate heart
tissue samples with I/R and non-I/R (control). The expression levels of miRNAs as well as genes were measured in heart
grafts by microarray and real time RT-PCR. miRNA alteration in cardiomyocytes exposed to hypoxia was also detected by
qRT-PCR. We observed significant alterations in miRNA and gene expression profile after I/R injury. There were 39 miRNAs
significantly downregulated and 20 upregulated up to 1.5 fold in heart grafts with I/R injury compared with the grafts
without I/R. 48 genes were observed with 3 fold change and p,0.05 and 18 signalling pathways were enriched using Keggs
pathway library. Additionally, hypoxia/reperfusion induced primary cardiomyocyte apoptosis and altered miRNA expression
profiles. In conclusion, this is the first report on miRNA expression profile for heart transplantation associated with I/R injury.
These findings provide us with an insight into the role of miRNA in I/R injury in heart transplantation.

Introduction
Since the 1970s, heart failure (HF) prevalence has been
increasing in the world as a consequence of a decline in coronary
artery and cerebrovascular disease mortality [1]. Although there
are many treatments available for HF patients, heart transplan￾tation remains the best option for long-term survival for end-stage
HF patients [2]. However, this effective treatment for heart failure
is severely affected by ischemia reperfusion (I/R) injury occurring
during transplantation.
Despite major achievements in heart transplantation, I/R injury
is a major contributing factor in graft failure and longer ischemia
time has shown to lower the long-term survival rate, especially for
older patients [3]. In addition, due to a shortage of donors,
physicians are forced to enlarge the donor pool by accepting
marginal organs, which include organs from elderly or ill patients,
and thus they are more susceptible to I/R injury [3]. Currently,
there are no effective treatments against ischemia reperfusion
injury. It is important to explore new alternative mechanisms
involved in I/R injury during heart transplantation.
miRNAs are endogenous, short, non-coding single-stranded
RNAs that are approximately 20 nucleotides in length. miRNAs
have emerged as a key player in physiology as well as
pathophysiology attributable to its ability to downregulate gene
expression through mRNA destabilization/degradation and trans￾lation repression by binding onto either 39 UTR or 59UTR of the
mRNA [4]. Several studies have shown that miRNAs have the
ability to regulate the expression profiles of genes in signalling
pathways associated with heart diseases, including heart failure,
hypertrophy, and ischemia reperfusion injury [5]. Therefore, it is
crucial to examine the role of miRNA in heart transplantation and
its implications for I/R signalling pathways. In this study, for the
first time, we report miRNA expression profiles in I/R injured
heart grafts and also investigated mRNA expression profiles that
may be affected by miRNAs.
Materials and Methods
Animals
Eight weeks old C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Charles
River Laboratory (Canada). All procedures involving mouse
breeding and surgery were performed according to the guidelines
of the Canadian Council of Animal Care and were approved by
the Animal Use Subcommittee at the University of Western
Ontario, Canada.

Induction of Cold Ischemia Reperfusion Injury and Heart
Transplantation
C57BL/6 mice were anesthetized with ketamine/protophin and
injected with 1 ml heparin. Donor hearts were excised from mice
and heterotopically implanted into the peritoneal cavity with the
donor aorta anastomosed to the recipient abdominal aorta and the
pulmonary artery connected to the inferior vena cava. For
induction of cold I/R injury, donor hearts were preserved with
University of Wisconsin (UW) solution at 4uC for 18 hours before
implantation. Meanwhile, the rest of the excised heart was
immediately implanted into the recipient to generate non cold
ischemia injury heart (non-I/R) as controls. At the endpoint of
experiments, mice were sacrificed by injection over dose of
ketamine/protophin and heart grafts were harvested for future
studies.
Histological Analysis
At 24 hours post-transplantation, heart grafts were collected
from mice and tissue slices were fixed in 10% formalin and
processed for histology examination using standard techniques.
Formalin tissue was embedded in paraffin and 5 mm sections were
stained with hematoxylin and eosin stain (H&E).
Myeloperoxidase (MPO) Activity
To detect neutrophil infiltration, MPO activity was detected in
heart tissues. Paraffin tissue sections were stained with MPO
antibody (Santa Cruz, San Diego, CA) following the manufactur￾er’s instruction. Each slide was examined by light microscopy at
2006 magnification.
Terminal Deoxynucleotidyl Transferase-mediated dUTP
Nick End Labelling (TUNEL) Assay
To detect cell apoptosis in heart grafts, TUNEL assay was
performed on paraffin tissue sections using an in situ cell death
detection kit according to the manufacturer’s instruction (Roche,
Mississauga, ON, Canada). Sections were counter-stained with
hematoxylin. Each slide was examined by light microscopy at
2006 magnification.
microRNA/RNA Extraction
Fresh heart tissues or primary cardiomyocytes were collected
and subjected to the extraction of miRNA/RNA. miRNAs were
extracted using a miRNeasy mini Kit (Qiagen, Ontario, Canada).
RNA quality was assessed using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer
(Agilent Technologies Inc., Palo Alto, CA) and the RNA 6000
Nano kit (Caliper Life Sciences, Mountain View, CA). One
microgram of total RNA was used to synthesize cDNA for
measuring miRNA expression using miRScript II kit (Qiagen,
Ontario, Canada) according to the manufacturer’s manual.
miRNA Microarray
All sample labeling and GeneChip processing were performed
at the London Regional Genomics Centre (Robarts Research
Institute, London, Ontario, Canada; http://www.lrgc.ca). One
microgram of total RNA was labeled using the Flash Tag Biotin
HSR kit from Genisphere (http://www.genisphere.com/
array_detection_flashtag_biotin.html). Samples were then hybrid￾ized to Affymetrix miRNA 3.0 arrays for 16 hours at 48uC. All
washing steps were performed by a GeneChip Fluidics Station 450
and GeneChips were scanned with the GeneChip Scanner 3000
7 G (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) using Command Console
v3.2.4. Partek was used to determine ANOVA p-values and fold
changes for miRNAs. Species annotations were added and used to
filter only those miRNA found in Mus musculus. miRNA expression
data were submitted to the National Center for Biotechnology
Information Gene Expression Omnibus (http://www.ncbi.nlm.
nih.gov/geo/) under accession number GSE50885.
Gene Expression Microarray
Single stranded complementary DNA (sscDNA) was prepared
from 200 ng of total RNA as per the Ambion WT Expression Kit
for Affymetrix GeneChip Whole Transcript WT Expression
Arrays (http://www.ambion.com/techlib/prot/fm_4411973.pdf,
Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA). Total RNA was first
converted to cDNA, followed by in vitro transcription to make
cRNA. 5.5 mg of single stranded cDNA was synthesized; end
labeled and hybridized, for 16 hours at 45uC, to Mouse Gene
1.0 ST arrays. All washing steps were performed by a GeneChip
Fluidics Station 450 and GeneChips were scanned with the
GeneChip Scanner 3000 7 G (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) using
Command Console v3.2.4. Partek was used to determine ANOVA
p-values and fold changes for genes. Gene expression data were
submitted to the National Center for Biotechnology Information
Gene Expression Omnibus (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/)
under accession number GSE 50884.
Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase-polymerase Reaction
(q-PCR) for miRNA Expression
miRNAs were extracted from I/R and non-I/R heart tissues
using miRNeasy mini Kit (Qiagen, Ontario,Canada), then
cDNA were synthesized using miRScript II RT Kit (Qiagen,
Ontario). Synthesized cDNA samples were then subjected to
real time RT-PCR (Stratagene mx3005P) using miRScript
SYBR Green PCR Kit (Qiagen, Ontario) according to
instruction of the kit supplier. Thermal profiling for the real
time PCR was an initial activation step at 95uC for 10 mins,
followed by 40 cycles of: 95uC for 15 s, 55uC for 30 s, 70uC for
30 s. Expression levels between I/R and non-I/R were
quantitatively compared using the DDCt method with SNorD6
as the endogenous control for miRNA expression.
Primary Neonatal Cardiomyocytes Culture
Neonatal ventricular cardiomyocytes were cultured as described
by the Feng group [6]. Briefly, ventricular tissues from C57BL/
6 mice were isolated and minced within 24 h after birth.
Subsequently, cardiomyocytes were dispersed by incubation in a
D-Hank’s buffer supplemented with 0.5 mg/ml Liberase (Roche,
Worthington Biochemical, Lakewood, NJ) and the cellular
suspension was filtered through a polypropylene macro porous
filter (mesh opening 105 mm, Spectra Mesh; Spectrum Medical
Industries). The suspension was then centrifuged at 200 g for
5 min, and the cellular pellet was suspended in medium 199
(M199) with 10% FBS and penicillin-streptomycin (50 mg/ml;
GIBCO-BRL). The cellular suspension was pre-plated for 1.5 h at
37uC in 5% CO2 to remove any non-cardiomyocytes. Cell density
was adjusted to 106 cells/ml using M199 supplemented with 10%
FBS, and cells were seeded (5 6 105
) in polystyrene, nonpyro￾genic24-well culture plates (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ)
precoated with 1% gelatin. Cells were incubated in 5% CO2 at
37uC.
Hypoxia/Reperfusion Model for Cell Culture
Isolated primary cardiomyocytes were cultured in a 24 well
plate pre-coated with 1% gelatine for overnight. Culture medium
were replaced by 250 ml deoxygenated DMEM medium without
FBS and antibiotics and then placed in a chamber with 2% O2 at
miRNA and I/R Injury in Heart Transplantation
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 November 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 11 | e79805

37uC for 45 min. After hypoxia, cells were reoxygenated by
adding 250 ml of complete medium supplemented with 10% FBS
and cultured at 5% CO2, 37uC, for 24 h.
Annexin-V Staining and Flow Cytometry
Cardiomyocytes were harvested using Trypsin and suspended in
PBS solution with 2% FBS. Cells were double stained with
Annexin-V and PI using Annexin-V kit (ebioscience, San Diego,
CA) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. The fluorescence
from the stained cells was measured by flow cytometry (BD
bioscience, San Jose, CA).
Potential miRNA Targets
For selected miRNA that were significantly altered by I/R
injury in heart transplantation, online computational algorithm
analyses (Targetscan and FINDTAR3) were used to predict
potential target genes. Based on scientific literature, target genes
that are known to be involved in I/R injury pathways were
selected for further analysis.
Gene Expression
Total RNA isolations were performed using the TRIzol
reagent (Invitrogen), and cDNA was synthesized using oligo-(dT)
primer and reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. Synthesized cDNA samples were then
subjected to real time RT-PCR (Stratagene mx3005P and Bio￾Rad CFX) with SYBR Green and a final primer concentration
of 80 nM. Thermal profiling for the real time PCR was the
initial activation step at 95uC for 10 mins, followed by 40 cycles
of: 95uC for 30 s, 58uC for 30 s, 72uC for 30 s. Expression
levels between I/R and non-I/R were quantitatively compared
using the DCt method with mouse glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
dehydrogenase (GAPDH) as the endogenous control for target
gene expression.
Western Blotting
Heart tissues were homogenized with RIPA buffer containing
5 mg/ml PMSF as the manufacturer’s instruction (Invitrogen, Life
Tech., Ontario, Canada) and centrifuged at 10,000 g for 10 mins.
Protein concentration was measured using a Bradford assay (Bio￾Rad, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada). 40 mg of total proteins were
separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose
membranes. After blocking for 1 h in TBS supplemented with 5%
milk and 0.1% Tween20, membranes were blotted with rabbit anti
mouse polyclone angiopoietin 1 Ab (used at 1:500 dilution,
Abcam. Toronto, ON, Canada) and developed using HRP￾conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (1:5,000 dilution) (Santa Cruz, Dallas,
Texas) and enhanced chemiluminescence (Bio-Rad).
Statistical Analysis
All data are presented as means 6 SEM. Statistical comparisons
between two groups were performed using student’s t-test and
ANOVA was applied for the microarray data. Statistical
significance was determined as P,0.05.
Results
I/R Induced Cardio Graft Damage
Currently during organ transplantations, donor organs are
preserved using a hypothermal static method to reduce ischemia
reperfusion injury. Thus, I/R injury in organ transplantation is
usually referred to as cold I/R, differentiating it from that in non￾transplanted. Accordingly, we used this hypothermal static method
to preserve donor organs for a variety of periods in order to induce
cold ischemia-reperfusion injury. Histopathological staining (H&E,
apoptosis and neutrophil infiltration) were applied to assess the
severity of I/R injury in grafts. We found that 18 h cold ischemia
induced I/R injury - supported by results from H&E, TUNEL
assay, and MPO assay. H&E staining (Figure 1A) shows disrupted
architecture, necrosis, and degeneration in I/R groups compared
to the control (non-I/R) group. TUNEL assay (Figure 1B) shows
an increased number of apoptotic cells in I/R groups. As shown by
MPO assay (Figure 1C), increased myeloperoxidase activity was
observed in the I/R group, indicating there are neutrophils
infiltrating into grafts.
I/R Injury Altered miRNA Expression Profiles in Heart
Grafts
In order to characterize the miRNA expression profile that
regulates genes involved in I/R injury in heart transplantation, we
performed a microarray assay using Affymatrix: GeneChip
miRNA 3.0 Array that contains 1111 mouse probe sequences.
Heart grafts (n = 3/group) with I/R or with non-I/R (control)
were collected to extract miRNA at day 2 post transplantation.
Microarray assays showed that miRNA were expressed differen￾tially in heart grafts. A total of 59 miRNA were significantly
altered with the criteria of 1.5 fold change with P,0.05 (Table 1).
Out of the 59 altered miRNAs, 39 were downregulated in heart
grafts with I/R injury compared with the grafts without I/R, while
20 miRNA were upregulated (Table 1). As shown in a pie graph of
miRNA distribution based on their fold changes in expression
(Figure 2A), the majority of altered miRNA (49 out of 59) fell into
the range of 1.5 to 3 fold up or downregulation. Only ten miRNAs
(five up-regulated and another five down-regulated) displayed over
three fold changes between two groups. Each individual altered
miRNA with .3 fold change is shown in Figure 2B, indicating
that the miRNA changes fit a Poisson distribution. Additionally,
signalling pathway enrichment analysis was conducted based on
miRNAs with 1.5 fold change and p,0.05, 71 signalling pathways
were selected (enrichment P,0.05) using the Kegg pathway
library.
We further confirmed the expression of miRNA selected from
miRNA microarray results by quantitative PCR (Figure S1).
The expressions of miR-711, miR-714, miR-744, miR-2137,
miR-5130, miR-1892, miR-328, miR-346, miR-5099, and miR￾705 were significantly upregulated in I/R injured heart grafts,
while miR-490, miR-491, miR-210, miR-362, miR-24, miR￾423, miR-128, miR-328, miR -181, and miR-532 were
downregulated. According to intensity of fluorescence detected
on miRNA microarray and Ct values of qPCR, the expression
levels of these miRNA in heart tissues varied to a great extent
between each other. For example, miR-2137, miR-5130 and
miR-5112 were highly expressed in heart tissues; miR-490,
miR-491, miR-181, miR-362, miR-425, and miR-3104 were
expressed at quite a low level (Ct value , over 30), whereas 32
out of those 58 altered miRNA were expressed at an extremely
low level in hearts and there were almost no Ct value detected
by qPCR.
miRNA Expression Profile was Dynamically Changed in
Heart Grafts
Literature has reported that miRNA expression changes
dynamically [7]. Accordingly, we investigated whether miRNA
expression changes over time in hearts post transplantation. We
extracted grafts with I/R and with non-I/R at day 7 after
transplantation and detected the expression level of miRNAs

PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 3 November 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 11 | e79805

(miR-711, miR -714, miR-744, miR -2137, miR -5130, miR -
346, miR -490, miR -491, miR -24, and miR -328). As shown
in Figure 3, the expressions of miR-711, miR-714, miR-744,
miR -2137, miR -5130, miR -346, and miR -328 was still
upregulated in the I/R group, but the expression of miR-24
and miR-490 were downregulated, compared to the control
group grafts. The expression of miR-491 was slightly but not
significantly upregulated in I/R injured grafts. Compared with
grafts taken out on day 2 post-transplantation, the expression of
miR-2137, miR-714, miR-744, miR -2137, miR -5130, miR -
346, and miR -328 were slightly decreased, whilst the
expression of miR-711 continued its upregulation in the I/R
injured grafts.
Hypoxia/Reperfusion Incurred Cardiomyocyte Apoptosis
and miRNA Expression Change In Vitro
Cardiomyocyte is a main component of heart tissue. Given that
prolonged cold ischemia changed miRNA expression profiles in
heart grafts, we proposed to determine what the miRNA profile
would be in cardiomyocytes in response to hypoxia/reperfusion
stress in vitro and whether it was in line with that from heart
tissues in vivo. We isolated and cultured primary cardiomyocytes
from neonatal mice and subjected them to hypoxia/reperfusion
stress by exposing them to a 2% O2 chamber for 45 mins and then
reoxygenation for 24 h by incubation of cells in a 5% CO2 and
95% O2 incubator. We first measured cell apoptosis/death by
double staining with Annexin-V and PI to confirm cell injury
Figure 1. 18 h cold ischemia-reperfusion caused I/R injury in heart grafts. Donor hearts were isolated from C57BL/6 mice, infused with UW
solution and preserved in UW solution at 4uC for 18 h. After 18 h preservation, donor hearts were implanted into syngeneic recipient C57BL/6 mice.
At day 2 after transplantation, the heart grafts were harvested and fixed in 10% formalin. The paraffin heart sections were subjected to HE staining,
TUNEL assay, and MPO assay. (A) HE staining. (B) TUNEL assay for apoptosis. (C) MPO assay. Representative images were from experiments.

induced by hypoxia/reperfusion. Results showed that 45 mins
hypoxia/reperfusion induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis evidenced
by the increased percentage of apoptotic cells (Figure 4A) in
hypoxia/reperfusion treated cells as compared with cells without
hypoxia stress.
Next, we measured the expression of miRNA in hypoxia/
reperfusion -treated cardiomyocytes by qPCR. As compared
with cells under normxia, miR-711, miR-714, miR-328, miR￾346, miR-210, miR-744, miR-5130, miR-181a and miR-2137
were significantly over-expressed in hypoxia/reperfusion treated
cardiomyocytes, while the expression of miR-491, miR-211,
miR-532, miR-185, miR-425, miR-128, miR-24 was down￾regulated (Figure 4B). There was no significant difference in the
expression of miR-490 between the two groups (Figure 4B). As
expected, miR-2137, miR-210, miR-5130, and miR-328 were
highly expressed in cardiomyocytes, while miR-490, miR-491,
and miR-211 were expressed at a low level.

miRNA functions as a negative regulator of gene expression.
Similarly, using microarray assay, we investigated the global gene
expression changes in I/R injured heart grafts. Heart grafts with
or without prolonged ischemia were harvested at day 2 after
implantation and subjected to gene expression microarray assay
(Table S1). I/R greatly altered gene expression profiles in heart
grafts as shown in a heat map. The expression for the majority of
significant altered genes (P,0.05) was increased or decreased 1.5–
2 fold between two groups and also fits in a Poisson distribution
(Figure 5A and 5B). Most of the altered genes were expressed in
heart tissue at a moderate level with fluorescence intensities of
around 1000–2000 units in microarray (Figure 5C). Given a three￾fold change and P,0.05 (up and down) in differential expression
as a cut-off, the number of altered genes was reduced to 48; 36 of
them were downregulated, and 12 genes were up regulated
(Table 2). Among them, Angiopoietin 1(ANG1) decreased to the
greatest degree, which was confirmed by the Western blot
(Figure 5D).
To clarify which signalling pathways were affected by I/R in
heart transplantation, we applied the KEGG library and
performed enrichment analysis for microarray data. Eighteen
signalling pathways were enriched with the criteria of 2 fold
changes and p,0.05 (Table 3), which include the Insulin, Tyrosine
metabolism, cell cycle, gap junction, calcium, energy metabolism,

p53, cardio function associated signalling pathways and some
cancer signalling pathways. Less than 10% genes listed on those
pathways significantly changed with more than 2 folds. Figure 6
shows the information of these genes from the 18 altered signalling
pathways listed on Table 3. Most genes from those pathways were
downregulated, except genes in the p53 and one carbon pool by
folate, bladder cancer, acute myeloid leukemia and transcriptional
misregulation in cancer pathways were upregulated. The Gap
junction pathway evenly consisted of both up and downregulated
genes.
Discussion
I/R injury is recognized as a primary factor leading to graft
dysfunction [8] and graft failure [9,10]. It is important to
understand molecular mechanisms of I/R injury for the develop￾ment of therapies against I/R injury. The current study, for the
first time, reported on the expression profile of miRNA in I/R
injured heart grafts in heart transplantation. The findings of our
study demonstrate that miR-711, miR-2137 miR-705, miR-5130,
miR-346, miR-714, and miR-744 were significantly upregulated

expression of miRNA were detected by qPCR.

signalling pathways were significantly altered with more than 2

ligation model [33]. However, in this study we did not observe the
above miRNAs change in heart grafts. The reason for this might
be that miRNA expression changes dynamically and miRNA
expression varies between different models [34,35].
In this study, we observed that miR-711 was significantly up￾regulated both in I/R injured heart grafts and hypoxia/
reperfusion treated primary cardiomyocytes. Despite only a few
studies of miR-711 have been reported, available data have shown
that miR-711 is expressed in many types of cells [36,37,38] and is
upregulated under different stresses [39,40]. For example, a
chemical palmitate used to induce insulin resistance increases the
expression of miR-711 in mouse muscle C2C12 cells [41]. A study
has also shown that miR-711 was significantly upregulated in the
myocardium with acute myocardial infarction on day 14 post
ischemia [42]. Tranter et al reported shows that cardiac ischemic
preconditioning (IPC) of the in vivo mouse heart results in
decreased levels of miR-711 which was dependent on NF-kB,
and that miR-711 post-transcriptionally suppresses Hsp70.3 [43].
A more recent study reported that Pioglitazone (an insulin
sensitizing drug with cardio protective effect, it attenuates cardiac
fibrosis) increased miR-711 levels in myocardial infarction rats and
miR-711 directly targeted and downregulated SP1, leading to
reduced collagen-I levels [44]. However, the expression level of
SP1 and HSP70 was not altered in I/R injured heart tissues in this
study (data not shown). It may be attributed to differences in
animal model and injury. Predicted by TargetScan and FIND￾TAR3, Angiopoietin 1 (ANG1) is a putative target of miR-711.
Our data also showed that ANG1 was significantly downregulated
in I/R injured hearts and hypoxia-treated cardiomyocytes,
suggesting ANG1 might be a target of miR-711. Supportively,
Lee et al [45] demonstrated that ANG1 can exert cardio
protective effects by preventing vascular leakage and cardiomyo￾cyte death by inhibiting activities of Caspase 3 and Caspase 9.
Further study on miR-711 function will help us understand the
regulatory roles of miR-711.
Additionally, miR-2137, miR-1893, miR-744, miR-705 and
miR-714 are highly expressed in heart tissue and cardiomyocytes
as well, suggesting that these miRNA are important for
cardiomyocytes survival and growth. However, there are no
reports available on miR-2137 and 1893 regarding their functions.
Performing computational analysis using TargetScan, two con￾served genes, retrograde golgi transport homolog (RGP1) and
pleckstrin and Sec7 domain containing (Psd), were predicted as
targets of miR-2137, while another 144 genes including calmod￾ulin binding transcription activator 1(Camta1) and furry homolog￾like (Fryl) were predicted irrespective of site conservation. The
data from the gene expression microarray assay showed that the
Camta1 gene was significantly downregulated in I/R injured
grafts. It has been shown that CAMTA 1 can activate the
expression of the anti-proliferative cardiac hormone natriuretic
peptide A (NPPA) in the heart and is recognised as a tumor
suppressor [46]. Another family member of CAMTA, the
transcriptional coactivator CAMTA2 stimulates cardiac growth
by opposing class II histone deacetylases, while the loss of
CAMTA2 promotes cardiomyocyte hypertrophy [47]. Taken

together, the increased expression of miR-2137 may play a role in
I/R injury in heart transplantation through regulating CAMTA 1.
miR-705, miR-714 and miR-744 have not been extensively
investigated yet. It has been reported that the expression of miR￾714 and miR-744 are significantly higher in mice aorta with
vascular calcification [48]. miR-744 is known to be expressed in
cardiac valves [49] and involved in cancer cell growth and
proliferation [50,51]. Recent studies have shown that miR-744
targets TGF-b and eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 alpha
2(eEF1A2) which is able to promote cell growth and inhibit
apoptosis [52,53,54]. Our data showed that eEF1A2 was
decreased in I/R injured hearts, implying that there may be a
causative relationship between miR-744 and eEF1A2. Predicted
by TargetScan, miR-705 has 89 putative targets including
Transmembrane BAX inhibitor motif containing 1 (TMBIM1)
with conservative sites. TMBIM1 has been well documented as a
part of the Bax Inhibitor-1(BI-1) family that has a similar anti￾apoptotic function as Bcl-2 and miR-705 induced inactivation of
TMBIM1 may be responsible for the increase rate of apoptosis
after I/R injury [55]. Although our cDNA microarray data did
not show significant changes of TMBIM1 expression at the
mRNA level, we can not rule out TMBIM1 as a putative target of
miR-705 because that miRNA functions via translation repression
as well. Our data also showed that miR-346 was highly expressed
in normal heart tissues and upregulated by I/R. There are 90
putative targets of miR-346 predicted by the TargetScan. Most
studies on miR-346 have been investigated in a rheumatoid
arthritis model [56,57]. The expression of miR-346 was positively
correlated with the severity of ischemic injury in a mouse hepatic
ischemia/reperfusion injury model [58]. It has been demonstrated
that miR-346 can target receptor-interacting protein 140
(RIP140), TNFa, Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), IL18 and
antigen peptide transporter 1 (TAP1) [56,59,60]. The expression
of LIF was decreased in the I/R injured heart grafts (data not
shown), indicating miR-346 may negatively regulate LIF.
miR-24 has previously shown a protective effect on I/R injury
[16,17,18]. We observed a decrease in the expression of miR-24 in
the I/R injured heart grafts but it was not significant. However, we
did see a significant reduction of miR-24 in hypoxia-treated
primary cardiomyocytes, which is consistent with reported
literature [16,17,18]. Since an entire heart tissue consists of
multiple lineages of cells such as cardiomyocyte, endothelial cell,
and fibroblast cell, the expression of miR-24 in heart is an
accumulation from all cells in the heart, and other cells may buffer
the reduction of miR-24 in cardiomyocytes.
The data from gene expression microarray showed that 48
genes (36 downregulated and 12 up-regulated) were significantly
changed with more than three fold in prolonged cold I/R. Among
them, some genes have been demonstrated to be involved in the
growth and function of cardiac cells. For examples, growth of
Ankyrin repeat and suppressor of cytokine signaling box-contain￾ing protein (ASB) 15 regulates myoblast differentiation [61]; G
protein-coupled receptors 22 (GPCRs 22) which are highly
expressed in cardiac myocytes and coronary arteries plays an
essential role in the regulation of cardiac contractile function and
cardiomyocyte apoptosis [27] and Leucine-rich repeat containing
10 (Lrrc10), a cardiac-specific factor, is crucial for proper cardiac
development. Deletion of Lrrc10 in mice results in dilated
cardiomyopathy [62]. Furthermore, uncoupling protein 3(UCP3)
[63], angiopoietin 1 [45] and growth differentiation factor-15
(GDF-15) [64] are anti-apoptotic genes and show protective effects
on I/R injury in non-transplantation settings. Therefore, those
altered genes might be good targets for the prevention of I/R
injury in heart transplantation.
In conclusion, our study demonstrates that ischemia reperfusion
injury in heart tissue after transplantation is associated with an
altered miRNA profile, which will help us to understand roles of
miRNA in I/R injury. In addition, this study provides insights into
the mechanisms involved in I/R injury and investigate specific
miRNA that regulate genes associated with signalling pathways
involved in I/R injury. As miRNAs hold great potential as
therapeutic targets, expression levels can be modified to prevent,
or revert ischemia reperfusion injury that occurs during heart
transplantation - minimizing graft failure and increasing graft
long-term survival rate.
