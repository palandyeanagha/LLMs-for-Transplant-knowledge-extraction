Abstract
AIM To determine clear cut echocardiographic criteria for isolated
ventricular non-compaction (IVNC), a cardiomyopathy as yet
“unclassified” by the World Health Organization. The disease is not
widely known and its diagnosis mostly missed.
METHODS AND RESULTS In seven out of a series of 34 patients
with IVNC the in vivo echocardiographic characteristics were
validated against the anatomical examination of the heart removed
after death in four and due to heart transplantation in three
patients. Four morphological criteria diagnostic for IVNC were
found. (1) Coexisting cardiac abnormalities were absent (by
definition). (2) A two layer structure was seen, with a compacted
thin epicardial band and a much thicker non-compacted
endocardial layer of trabecular meshwork with deep
endomyocardial spaces. A maximal end systolic ratio of non-
compacted to compacted layers of > 2 is diagnostic. (3) The
predominant localisation of the pathology was to mid-lateral (seven
of seven patients), apical (six), and mid-inferior (seven) areas. The
pathological preparations confirmed the echocardiographic
findings. Concomitant regional hypokinesia was not confined to the
non-compacted segments. (4) There was colour Doppler evidence of
deep perfused intertrabecular recesses.
CONCLUSIONS Four clear cut echocardiographic diagnostic criteria
were established. It is suggested that the WHO classification of
cardiomyopathies be reconsidered to include IVNC as a distinct
cardiomyopathy.
