Abstract
Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is common in patients with dialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease and is an independent
predictor of mortality. However, specific hemodynamics of the pulmonary circulation, changes induced by hemodialysis and
characterization into pre- or postcapillary PH have not been evaluated in patients with chronic kidney disease. We assessed
consecutive patients with end-stage chronic kidney disease in WHO FC$II with dyspnea unexplained by other causes on
hemodialysis (group 1, n = 31) or without dialysis (group 2, n = 31) using right heart catheterization (RHC). In group 1, RHC
was performed before and after dialysis. In end-stage chronic kidney disease, prevalence of precapillary PH was 13% (4/31),
and postcapillary PH was discovered in 65% (20/31). All four cases of precapillary PH were unmasked after dialysis. In group
2, two cases of precapillary PH were detected (6%), and postcapillary PH was diagnosed in 22 cases (71%). This is the first
study examining a large cohort of patients with chronic kidney disease invasively by RHC for the prevalence of PH. The
prevalence of precapillary PH was 13% in patients with end-stage kidney disease. That suggests careful screening for
precapillary PH in this selected patient population. RHC should be performed after hemodialysis.

Introduction
The prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in the
developed world is 13% [1] and is recognized as a condition that
elevates the risk of cardiovascular complications as well as kidney
failure and other complications. End-stage kidney disease (ESKD)
substantially increases the risk of death, cardiovascular disease,
and use of specialized health care. In this context, pulmonary
hypertension (PH) has been reported in patients with ESKD
maintained on long-term hemodialysis. Based on echocardio￾graphic studies, the prevalence of PH in these patient populations
is estimated to be around 17–56% [2–7], and PH is an
independent predictor of mortality in such patients [6,7].
However, these studies lack invasive hemodynamic data and thus
cannot discriminate between pre- and postcapillary PH in
unselected patients with or without symptoms.
PH is a hemodynamic and pathophysiological state found in a
range of clinical conditions and is characterized by an increase in
mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP $25 mmHg); precap￾illary PH is defined by the additional criterion of a pulmonary
arterial wedge pressure (PCWP) #15 mmHg [8]. The different
forms of PH have been classified into five clinical groups with
specific characteristics [8,9]. Group 1 consists of the major forms
of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH: idiopathic, heritable
and associated with connective tissue disease and congenital heart
disease etc.). A diagnosis of PAH requires the exclusion of all other
causes of PH, and specific treatments are available. Group 2
describes PH due to left heart disease including diastolic
dysfunction, Group 3 PH due to lung diseases and/or hypoxia
and Group 4 is chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension
(CTEPH). Group 5 consists of PH with unclear and/or
multifactorial mechanisms including ‘‘chronic renal failure on
dialysis’’ [8,9]. The pathogenesis of PAH is poorly understood,
and the associated conditions that result in PAH are heterogenous
and seemingly unrelated.
The purpose of the PEPPER-study (‘‘prevalence of precapillary
pulmonary arterial hypertension in patients with end-stage renal
disease’’) was to assess the specific hemodynamics in CKD patients
with otherwise unexplained dyspnea on hemodialysis and in those
without dialysis, to elucidate possible risk factors contributing to
PH, and to evaluate hemodynamic changes induced by hemodi￾alysis – by use of right heart catheterization (RHC), the ‘‘gold
standard’’ method for the diagnosis and characterization in pre￾and postcapillary PH.

Methods
Patients
This was a prospective, single center study conducted at the
University of Bonn, Germany. Local ethics committee approval
was obtained prior to the inclusion of any patient in the study
(Ethics committee, University of Bonn, Germany, 061/09) and the
study was conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki.
Written informed consent was obtained from all participants
involved in our study. Consecutive patients with severe CKD stage
4 or 5 [10] attending the clinic for regular treatment were assessed
for enrollment suitability using defined inclusion and exclusion
criteria. Within the one year ESKD patients with dialysis were
recruited and compared to patients with CKD without dialysis.
The study started in November 2009 and ended in October 2010
after 62 patients (31 patients in each group) were included.
Detailed information is given in figure 1. Inclusion criteria were:
adults $18 years old, stage 4 or 5 CKD (defined as serum
creatinine $200 mmol/l [2.26 mg/dl] or glomerular filtration rate
[GFR] #30 ml/min/1.73 m2 assessed by MDRD4-formula
[11,12] for a time span $1 year), on hemodialysis or without
hemodialysis treatment, and in World Health Organization
functional class (WHO FC) $II with dyspnea unexplained by
other causes. Exclusion criteria were: uncontrolled arterial
hypertension (defined as mean blood pressure before entry into
the study $160/100 mmHg), current malignant diseases, preg￾nancy, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ,50%, mitral or
aortic regurgitation .grade 2, aortic or mitral surface ,1.5 cm2
,
myocarditis, endocarditis, pericarditis, severe anemia (hemoglobin
concentration ,10 g/dl), severe chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease (COPD) defined by FEV1 ,60% predicted, lung fibrosis,
and known PAH medication with prostanoids, endothelin receptor
antagonists, or phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors. The following
assessments were undertaken in all patients: medical history
(including exact data concerning immunosuppressive medication,
other medication and duration of renal insufficiency before
starting dialysis and the time under dialysis as well as the daily
amount of residual diuresis); clinical examination, including
height, (dry-)weight, blood pressure; standard 12-lead-electrocar￾diography (ECG); transthoracic echocardiography (TTE); lung
function testing (bodyplethysmography); laboratory investigations
including blood count, and potassium, sodium, aspartate amino￾trasferase/alanine aminotransferase (AST/ALT), creatinine and
urea levels.
Right heart catheterization
All patients underwent RHC. RHC in CKD patients on dialysis
was performed before and after dialysis, if PH was confirmed with
the first RHC. As shown in table 1 PH was defined as mean
pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP) $25 mmHg regardless of the
pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP). If mPAP was
$25 mmHg and PCWP was #15 mmHg, the diagnosis of
precapillary PH was made. In case of precapillary PH, a complete
work-up (including chest computertomography-scan, ventilation￾perfusion-scan, sleep apnea screening, ultrasound of the liver and
laboratory testing) was performed to verify or exclude PAH.
Vasoreactivity testing (inhaled iloprost 5 mg; iNeb, Philips
Healthcare, Eindhoven, Netherlands) was performed in case of
precapillary PH/PAH. Positive vasoreactivity was defined as a
decrease of mPAP $10 mmHg to reach #40 mmHg with a stable
cardiac index (CI) [8]. Cardiac index was measured by direct Fick
method.
Statistical analysis
The German version of SPSS V17.0 (IBM, Munich, Germany)
was used as a database and for statistical analysis. Data are
expressed as mean 6 standard deviation and as a percentage for
categorial parameters. Differences between groups were compared
with Student’s t-test and Mann-Witney-U test, as applicable. Chi￾square test was used to estimate the occurrence of categorical
variables. Two-tailed bivariate correlations were determined by
the Pearson’s coefficient. Statistical significance was set at p,0.05.

chronic hemodialysis treatment (group 1) and 31 patients with
CKD (group 2) not on dialysis are presented in Table 2. We
observed significant differences in age (the mean age of the dialysis
cohort was 8 years lower than the nondialysis group), body mass
index (BMI was lower in the dialysis group), median time to
enrollment after manifestation of CKD (4.9 years in the dialysis
group vs. 1.5 years in the non-dialysis group), and use of calcium
channel blockers (increased in the dialysis group).
Right heart catheterization
All 62 patients underwent RHC; data are given in Table 3.
In group 1, RHC was performed before and after dialysis, if
mPAP was $25 mmHg before dialysis (n = 25). If mPAP was
determined as ,25 mmHg by RHC before dialysis, PH/PAH was
excluded, and patients did not undergo a second RHC (n = 6). PH
was observed in 25/31 (81%) patients in the dialysis group (before
dialysis) versus 22/31 (71%) in the nondialysis cohort. After
dialysis in group 1, prevalence of PH was 24/31 (77%, 20/31
postcapillary PH, 4/31 precapillary PH). There was a significant
decrease of mPAP and PCWP after dialysis (mPAP from 62618 to
55617 mmHg; and PCWP from 2568 to 2066 mmHg). All four
cases of precapillary PH were identified only by the RHC
performed after dialysis treatment; none of the four patients was
vasoreactive to inhaled iloprost.
In nondialysis patients (group 2), postcapillary PH was
diagnosed in 22/31 cases (71%); precapillary PH without
vasoreactivity was found in 2/31 cases (6%). Hemodynamic data
were similar to the dialysis group (Table 3); only the higher CI in
the dialysis group reached significance.
Prevalence of precapillary and postcapillary PH
The clinical and hemodynamic profiles of the patients with
precapillary PH are displayed in Table 4. Further diagnostic
workup according to clinical guidelines [8], including chest CT￾scan, ventilation-perfusion-scan, sleep apnea screening, ultrasound
of the liver and laboratory testing, confirmed precapillary PH due
to hemodialysis (Dana Point Group 5 [9]) in three patients, and
excluded PAH and diagnosed PH due to lung diseases and/or
hypoxia in three further cases (Dana Point Group 3 [9]; two
patients with mild PH and COPD, one patient with mild PH and
sleep disordered breathing). In a total of 3/31 CKD patients on
dialysis precapillary PH that was not explained by the PH workup
(i.e. Dana Point group 1 or 5) was diagnosed, whereas precapillary
PH (Dana Point group 1 or 5) was not found in nondialysis CKD
patients. Thus, prevalence of precapillary PH (Dana Point group 1
or 5) was 10% in CKD patients on dialysis. There were no further
clinically remarkable differences between the patients with
precapillary compared to postcapillary PH or between patients
with or without PH.
Discussion
We present the results of the first prospective study evaluating
the prevalence of precapillary PH by use of RHC in a large cohort
of patients with CKD on dialysis or without dialysis. In this
symptomatic cohort with dyspnea WHO FC $II, the prevalence
of precapillary PH (Dana Point group 1 or 5) was found to be 10%
in the examined CKD patients requiring renal replacement
therapy, whereas no cases of precapillary PH were detected in
nondialysis CKD patients. In contrast, the prevalence of PH in
CKD patients on or without dialysis was similar (77 vs. 71%,
respectively) and considerably higher than previously reported (56
vs. 39% [3]; 44 vs. 32% [6]). The reason for the higher prevalence
in our study could be due to the high risk nature of our cohort

which included only patients with dyspnea in WHO FC $II,
whereas other studies also included asymptomatic patients [2–7].
Another strength of our study is the use of invasive methodology
(RHC), considered a requirement and the ‘‘gold standard’’ for the
differential diagnosis between pre- and postcapillary PH and
assessment of hemodymic impairment [8], for all study partici￾pants. Previous studies used only echocardiographic estimation of
systolic PAP for PH diagnosis [2–7].
Since the prevalence of precapillary PH in our participants
dramatically exceeds the prevalence of PAH in the general
population of 15–50 per million adult population [8,10], end-stage
kidney disease or dialysis itself may be a trigger for the
development of precapillary PH in a predisposed patient,
analogous to connective tissue disease, HIV, or portal hyperten￾sion. Hormonal and metabolic disturbances associated with CKD
requiring dialysis might lead to pulmonary vascular constriction
[8]. There are several pathogenetic mechanisms which may
contribute to the development of precapillary PH in patients
undergoing long-term dialysis, including impaired endothelial
function [13], decreased bioavailability of nitric oxide (NO)
[14,15], and increased levels of endothelin (ET)-1 [16–19]. PAP
may also be increased by high cardiac output resulting from the
arteriovenous access and/or concomitant renal anemia, as well as
from fluid overload [9,20,21]. In addition, diastolic and systolic left
heart dysfunctions are frequent in this setting [9] as also indicated
by the high rate of postcapillary PH in this study. Due to the fact
that we have excluded patients with reduced left ventricular
ejection fraction the main diagnosis in our cohort probably is
diastolic dysfunction.
In some patients, it may be difficult to distinguish between a
diagnosis of precapillary PH and heart failure with preserved
ejection fraction/diastolic dysfunction. In the present study, in
CKD patients on dialysis, precapillary PH initially masked by fluid
overload was unmasked by dialysis in 4/25 cases of primarily
postcapillary PH. However, one may argue the opposite i.e.
masking of postcapillary PH by fluid withdrawal. In particular,
exercise hemodynamics or volume challenge have been proposed
as means of identifying LV dysfunction, but these diagnostic tools
require further standardization and can often not be applied to
dialysis patients [8]. Even so, an elevated transpulmonary pressure
gradient (TPG; mPAP minus PCWP) .12 mmHg is suggestive of
intrinsic changes in the pulmonary circulation overriding the
passive increase in PCWP. As demonstrated in Table 3, mPAP as
well as PCWP were elevated before dialysis compared with
afterwards, whereas TPG did not differ significantly. Moreover, in
all CKD-precapillary-PH patients the stable ‘‘out-of-proportion’’
TPG suggests a precapillary component in addition to the fluid
overload before dialysis. Therefore the elevated TPG might point
towards CKD- precapillary-PH already at the time before
hemodialysis. However, we propose that RHC should be
performed after dialysis to unmask precapillary PH. The Dana
Point classification assigns PH in patients with CKD to Group 5,
i.e. all of the patients in the present study primarily belong into this
group [8,9]. However, based on the present post-dialysis
hemodynamics, a re-grouping of some CKD patients with
precapillary PH into Group 1 at least is to be discussed in
upcoming guidelines. Certainly there is need for more data, i.e. if
histopathological changes of the here-described cohort are similar
to those patients in Dana Point group 1 (PAH). We explicitly do
not want to encourage CKD patients with a precapillary PH to be
treated with specific PAH drugs, as there is no knowledge about
the efficacy of those therapies in this cohort.
There are notable limitations of this single-center study. Each
patient was only measured once invasively. Especially in the
hemodialysis cohort it would be possible that RHC would have led
to different results over the time caused by different fluid
overload/dry weight. However, we think that our invasive
approach is new and more catheterizations cannot be enforced
in this patients’ cohort. We did not obtain data measuring
extracellular fluid (ECF). Another limitation is the measurement of
CI by direct Fick method. Due to arteriovenous fistula, the
product of the Fick formula and therefore CI and PVR might be
changed. However, there is no influence on PAP and PCWP.
Treatment regimens were not assessed. Therefore, the question
how best to treat patients with CKD and PH/PAH remains
unresolved. Although information on specific PAH treatment or
clinical outcome would be of interest, it would necessitate a
controlled, prospective study analyzing clinical end points with
specific PAH treatment and requiring a follow-up period of several
years and the recruitment of a large patient cohort. With the
exception of isolated case reports [22], the efficacy of current
medical therapeutics for PAH such as prostanoids, endothelin
receptor antagonists and phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors have not
been studied in CKD patients.
In conclusion, this study provides evidence that precapillary PH
is a common co-morbidity in CKD patients on dialysis. End-stage
kidney disease and/or hemodialysis rather than the renal
insufficiency itself seems to be the main determining risk factor
for developing precapillary PH. Diagnostic RHC should be
performed after dialysis to diferentiate precapillary from postcap￾illary PH.
