Abstract
1,25 (OH)2
 Vitamin D3 (VD3
) and retinoic acid (RA) func￾tion as ligands for nuclear receptors which regulate tran￾scription. Though the cardiovascular system is not thought
to represent a classical target for these ligands, it is clear
that both cardiac myocytes and vascular smooth muscle
cells respond to these agents with changes in growth charac￾teristics and gene expression. In this study we demonstrate
that each of these ligands suppresses many of the pheno￾typic correlates of endothelin-induced hypertrophy in a cul￾tured neonatal rat cardiac ventriculocyte model. Each of
these agents reduced endothelin-stimulated ANP secretion
in a dose-dependent fashion and the two in combination
proved to be more effective than either agent used alone
(VD3
: 49%; RA: 52%; VD3 1 RA: 80% inhibition). RA, at
concentrations known to activate the retinoid X receptor,
and, to a lesser extent, VD3
 effected a reduction in atrial
natriuretic peptide, brain natriuretic peptide, and a-skeletal
actin mRNA levels. Similar inhibition (VD3
: 30%; RA: 33%;
VD3 1 RA: 59% inhibition) was demonstrated when cells
transfected with reporter constructs harboring the relevant
promoter sequences were treated with VD3
 and/or RA for 48 h.
These effects were not accompanied by alterations in endo￾thelin-induced c-fos, c-jun, or c-myc gene expression, sug￾gesting either that the inhibitory locus responsible for the
reduction in the mRNA levels lies distal to the activation of
the immediate early gene response or that the two are not
mechanistically coupled. Both VD3
 and RA also reduced
[
3H]leucine incorporation (VD3
: 30%; RA: 33%; VD3 1 RA:
45% inhibition) in endothelin-stimulated ventriculocytes
and, once again, the combination of the two was more effec￾tive than either agent used in isolation. Finally, 1,25 (OH)2
vitamin D3
 abrogated the increase in cell size seen after en￾dothelin treatment. These findings suggest that the liganded
vitamin D and retinoid receptors are capable of modulating
the hypertrophic process in vitro and that agents acting
through these or similar signaling pathways may be of value
in probing the molecular mechanisms underlying hypertro￾phy. (J. Clin. Invest. 1996. 97:1577–1588.) Key words: car￾diac hypertrophy • gene regulation • atrial natriuretic pep￾tide • brain natriuretic peptide • a-skeletal actin
Introduction
The seco-steroid 1,25 (OH)2
 vitamin D3
 is a polar metabolite
of vitamin D which binds with high affinity to the vitamin D re￾ceptor (VDR)1
 in target cells. This liganded receptor interacts
with specific recognition elements (consensus sequence repre￾sented by AGGTCANNNAGGTCA) (1) present in the regu￾latory regions of target genes and, through an as yet undefined
mechanism, triggers an increase or reduction in transcriptional
activity. This activity may be amplified through association of
the liganded VDR with a second regulatory protein, the ret￾inoid X receptor (RXR). This association produces a het￾erodimeric complex which binds the recognition element more
avidly and regulates transcription with greater efficiency (2).
Though not considered a traditional target for 1,25 (OH)2
vitamin D3
, the cardiovascular system is sensitive to the regula￾tory activity of this hormone. High-affinity receptors for 1,25
(OH)2
 vitamin D3
 have been identified in both myocardial (3)
and vascular smooth muscle (4) cells. In the cardiac myocyte
vitamin D has been linked to enhanced calcium transport
across the plasma membrane (5). In addition Weishaar and
Simpson have shown that 1,25 (OH)2
 vitamin D3 deficiency is
associated with aberrant cardiac contractility and hypertrophy
in a rodent model (6). The same group has identified changes
in cardiac morphology, largely confined to the interstitial com￾partment (7), as well as changes in the myosin isozyme profile
(8) in states of vitamin D deficiency.
Retinoic acid (RA), another nuclear hormone receptor
ligand, has also been shown to have important effects on the
heart. Mice homozygous for deletion of the RXRa gene mani￾fest developmental abnormalities in the cardiovascular system
(9, 10) with thin-walled ventricles reminiscent of atrial myocar￾dium (11). These animals die in utero, presumably due to con￾gestive cardiac failure. Superimposing deletions in the RA re￾ceptors (i.e., RARa or RARg) appears to amplify some
features of the RXRa 2/2 phenotype (10), suggesting that re￾tinoid receptor–signaled activity may converge at key points in
embryogenesis to promote normal development of the cardio￾vascular system.
Because adult cardiac myocytes lack mitotic capability,
they respond to growth stimuli largely through hypertrophy of
existing myocardial cells rather than through an increase in cell
number (i.e., hyperplasia). In vivo hypertrophy is activated in

situations associated with hemodynamic overload. This may
arise, in part, from the mechanical tension placed on the indi￾vidual cardiac myocytes and partially from activation of reflex
neuroendocrine activity (e.g. a-adrenergic activity and renin￾angiotensin system) which accompanies overload (12, 13). In
vitro models of hypertrophy which mimic the in vivo paradigm
with absolute fidelity are lacking; however, many studies have
focused on a model which closely resembles hypertrophy in
cultured neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (14). These cells re￾spond to a variety of stimuli, including a-adrenergic agonists,
endothelin (ET), angiotensin, growth factors, and mechanical
strain with an increase in macromolecular synthesis and
changes in cell morphology which resemble those seen with
cardiac hypertrophy (15–19). ET, in particular, has attracted
considerable interest as a potential autocrine or paracrine
modulator of hypertrophy. ET gene expression is activated in
cardiac myocytes by stimuli which promote hypertrophy (20,
21). Furthermore, ET receptor antagonists (22) have been
shown to reverse hypertrophy in aortic-banded rats in vivo.
Hypertrophic stimuli provoke a predictable and sequential ac￾tivation of gene expression which mimics that seen with in vivo
hypertrophy (23). The first genes to be activated are those of
the immediate early gene family (e.g., c-jun, c-fos, c-myc, and
egr-1), a group of protooncogene products which function pre￾dominantly as transcription factors in the cell nucleus. This is
followed by the activation of a second group of genes collec￾tively referred to as the embryonic repertoire or fetal gene
program. This group includes the a-skeletal actin, b-myosin
heavy chain, and the atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) genes.
As a group these genes are typically expressed in the fetal and
early neonatal ventricle. Expression decreases in the weeks af￾ter birth and remains quiescent in the adult myocardium un￾less the latter is subjected to a hemodynamic load capable of
generating hypertrophy. In the latter circumstance there is a
reactivation of the fetal program which persists for varying in￾tervals thereafter. ANP and b-MHC gene expression tends to
remain elevated for extended periods of time while a-skeletal
actin expression returns to basal levels within a few days de￾spite continued application of the stimulus. A third group of
genes is activated later in the hypertrophic process. This group,
which includes the cardiac actin and the myosin light chain-2
genes, is in large part responsible for providing the molecular
substrate for enlargement of the sarcomeric structure and hy￾pertrophy of the myocardial cell. The relationship which exists
among these three groups of genes is based largely on their ki￾netics of appearance, although there are data suggesting that
increases in immediate early gene expression may be tied
mechanistically to activation of the fetal gene program (24, 25).
Previously we have shown that 1,25 (OH)2
 vitamin D3
 neg￾atively regulates expression of the endogenous ANP gene (26)
as well as a transfected human (h) ANP-CAT reporter in cul￾tured rat atriocytes (27). This inhibition was dose dependent
with regard to both ligand and receptor and appeared to be
amplified in the presence of cotransfected RXR. Since ANP
gene expression is viewed as one of the earliest and most reli￾able markers of hypertrophy in the cardiac ventriculocyte, we
have examined the ability of these two ligand receptor systems
to antagonize ET-induced hypertrophy in these cells. Our find￾ings demonstrate that the hypertrophic process, assessed
through measurement of a number of conventional biochemi￾cal and morphological markers, is suppressed in the presence
of these ligands.
Methods
Materials. [
3H]Leucine, [a￾32P]dCTP, [g￾32P]ATP, and [3H]acetyl co￾enzyme A were purchased from DuPont/NEN Research Products
(Boston, MA). 1,25 (OH)2 Vitamin D3
 was obtained from BIOMOL
Research Labs Inc. (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Oxacalcitriol (OCT)
was generously provided by Chugai Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (Shi￾zuoka, Japan) and 9-cis RA by Dr. Arthur A. Levin of Hoffman￾LaRoche (Nutley, NJ). All-trans RA was purchased from Sigma
Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO). ET-1 was purchased from Peninsula
Laboratories, Inc. (Belmont, CA). Fluorescein-tagged phalloidin was
obtained from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). Other reagents
were purchased from standard commercial suppliers.
Cell preparation. Ventricular myocytes were isolated from the
lower two-thirds of 1-d-old neonatal rat hearts by alternate cycles of
trypsin digestion and mechanical disruption as previously described
(28). Myocytes were separated from mesenchymal cells (primarily fi￾broblasts) using a 30-min preplating step which fostered selective
adherence of fibroblasts but not myocytes to the culture surface. Fi￾broblast cultures were propagated from these initial preplates in se￾rum-containing medium and expanded through a single replating
(split 1:4) as described previously (28). Myocytes were either plated
directly in plastic culture dishes or used for electroporation (see be￾low) before plating. For [3H]leucine incorporation, ANP secretion,
and mRNA measurements, cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modi￾fied Eagle’s medium (DME H-21) containing 10% bovine calf serum
(EC) (Gemini Bioproducts, Calabasas, CA) and bromodeoxyuridine
(0.03 mg/ml) for 3 d to suppress fibroblast proliferation and then
changed to fresh serum-containing medium without bromodeoxyuri￾dine for an additional day. Before the initiation of each experiment,
cultures were placed in serum-free medium (29), and all subsequent
experimental manipulations were carried out in this medium. Trans￾fected cells were cultured in DME H-21 containing 10% EC for 24 h
before switching to the serum-free medium. Specific chemical addi￾tives or agonists were diluted 1:1,000 from stock solutions into serum￾free medium; similar concentrations of ligand-free vehicle were with￾out effect in these cultures.
Protein synthesis. Protein synthesis in the cultured neonatal rat
ventricular myocytes was assessed by measuring [3H]leucine incorpo￾ration into acid-insoluble cellular material. Ventricular myocytes
were plated in 24-well dishes at a density of 1 3 105
 cells/well. After
changing to serum-free medium for 24 h, cells were treated with dif￾ferent concentrations of 1,25 (OH)2 vitamin D3
 and/or all-trans RA
for defined periods of time. Where indicated, ET (1027
 M) was added
for the final 24 h of culture. For 4 h before collection cells were
pulsed with [3H]leucine in leucine-free medium containing the same
additives. Cells were washed twice with cold PBS, once with 10%
TCA, and extracted with 10% TCA at 48C for 30 min. Cell residues
were rinsed in 95% ethanol, solubilized in 0.25 N NaOH at 48C for
2 h, and then neutralized with 2.5 M HCl plus 1 M Tris-HCl (pH 7.5).
The radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation spectropho￾tometry.
Actin staining. Ventricular myocytes were cultured in 8-chamber
culture slides (Nunc Inc., Naperville, IL) at a density of 4 3 104
 cells/
chamber in 10% EC for 2 d, and then changed to serum-free DME
containing 1028
 M 1,25 (OH)2 vitamin D3
 or vehicle alone for 48 h. ET
(1027
 M) was included in the relevant samples for last 24 h of the in￾cubation. The medium was discarded; the cell layer was rinsed twice
with PBS, fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde for 10 min at room tempera￾ture, rinsed twice again with PBS, extracted with acetone for 5 min at
2208C, air dried, and exposed to the fluorescein-labeled phalloidin
probe, diluted as recommended by the manufacturer, for 20 min at
room temperature. After two rinses with PBS, the cell layer was cov￾ered with PBS/glycerol (1:1) solution, protected with a coverslip, and
stored in the dark at 48C. Photomicrographs were taken with a Leitz
epifluorescence microscope. Measurements of two-dimensional cell
surface areas were made on a Macintosh Quadra 660AV computer
using the public domain NIH Image Program (developed at the U.S.

Radioimmunoassay for ANP. Ventricular myocytes were plated
in 24-well dishes at a density of 1 3 105
 cells/well and cultured as de￾scribed above. 24 h before treatment, the cultures were shifted into
serum-free media and maintained under these conditions throughout
the remainder of the experiment. Cells were treated with 1,25 (OH)2
vitamin D3
, all-trans RA and/or ET as described above (see Protein
synthesis). Aliquots of media from the final 24-h culture period were
collected, centrifuged to remove cellular debris, and frozen at 2208C
until assayed. Radioimmunoassay was carried out using a rabbit anti–
rat ANP antibody and rat ANP1–28 as the standard and radiolabeled
tracer, as described previously (30).
RNA isolation and Northern blot analysis. Ventricular myocytes
were plated in 10-cm dishes and cultured and treated with 1,25 (OH)2
vitamin D3
 and/or RA as described above. Total RNA was extracted
from the cells by the guanidinium thiocyanate–CsCl method (31). 15
mg of RNA was size fractionated on a 2.2% formaldehyde/1% aga￾rose gel, transferred to nitrocellulose filters, and hybridized either
with an 840-bp rat ANP cDNA probe (30) isolated as a HindIII￾EcoRI fragment, or a 640-bp EcoRI fragment of the rat brain natri￾uretic peptide (BNP) cDNA (32). Each of these probes was labeled
with [a￾32P]dCTP using the random primer method. A 20-bp a-skele￾tal actin antisense oligonucleotide (59 GCAACCATAGCACGATG￾GTC 39) (33) was labeled with [g￾32P]ATP using polynucleotide ki￾nase. Individual blots were subsequently washed and reprobed with a
1.15-kb BamHI-EcoRI fragment of 18S ribosomal cDNA to permit
normalization of blots for differences in RNA loading and/or transfer
to the filter. Autoradiography was performed with an intensifying
screen at 2708C for 3 h to 1 d. Autoradiographic signals were quanti￾fied by laser densitometry.
Plasmid constructions. The reporter plasmid 21150 hANP CAT
containing 1,150 bp of 59-flanking sequence (FS) from the human
ANP gene linked to bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase
(CAT) coding sequence has been described previously (34). A sec￾ond reporter plasmid, 21173 hBNP CAT, containing 1,173 bp of 59-
FS from the human BNP gene linked to CAT coding sequence, was
generated from a plasmid (35) containing z 3,200 bp of hBNP ge￾nomic sequence, by PCR using an upstream sense oligonucleotide (59
CCTCTAGACCAGGCTGGAGTGCAGTGGCG 39) which incor￾porated an XbaI site at its 59 terminus and a downstream antisense
oligonucleotide (59 CCAAGCTTGGGACTGCGGAGGCTG 39)
which incorporated a HindIII site at its 59 terminus. A PCR product
of the appropriate size was restricted with XbaI and HindIII and sub￾cloned into compatible sites of pSVoLCAT (24, 36) Another reporter
plasmid, 21400 a-skeletal actin CAT, containing 1,400 bp of 59-FS
from the mouse a-skeletal actin gene promoter linked to CAT, was
kindly provided by P. Simpson (37). Both 2109TKCAT (28) and
DR3CAT (27) have been described previously. The latter contains a
direct repeat vitamin D response element (VDRE) with three nucle￾otide spacing (59-AGGTCAaggAGGTCA-39) immediately upstream
from the thymidine kinase (TK) promoter. The expression vectors
were generated as follows. The full-length cDNA for the human
VDR was generously provided by Dr. A. Baker (38). A 2.0-kb EcoRI
fragment containing the entire coding sequence for the receptor was
subcloned into pSVL; this latter vector allows expression of receptor
coding sequence from the SV40 promoter. The expression vector,
pRShRXRa, encoding the human RXR has been described (39), it
places 1,832 bp of hRXRa cDNA under the control of the RSV pro￾moter. pRShRARa (40) places 1,943 bp of hRARa cDNA down￾stream from the RSV promoter.
DNA transfection and CAT assay. Ventricular myocytes were
transfected with 20 mg of hANP-, hBNP-, or a-skeletal actin CAT to￾gether with 5–10 mg VDR, RAR, and/or RXR expression vector(s)
where indicated. Increasing vector DNA to as much as 15 mg per
transfection did not amplify the observed effect beyond that seen at
the 5-mg level. The total amount of transfected DNA was adjusted
with PUC18. Transient transfection was achieved by electroporation
(Gene Pulsar; Bio-Rad Laboratories, Richmond, CA) using 280 V at
250 mF, optimal conditions which were derived empirically. 10 3 106
cells were used for each transfection group. After transfection, cells
were plated in 6-well dishes at a density of 3 3 106
 cells/well in 10%
EC/DME. Medium was changed at 24 h to serum-free DME contain￾ing the appropriate reagent(s) and the incubation was continued for
an additional 48 h. Cells were then harvested and lysed in 250 mM
Tris/0.1% Triton X-100. Protein concentration of each cell extract
was measured using the Coomassie protein reagent (Pierce, Rock￾ford, IL). Cell lysates were processed for CAT assay (50–100 mg cel￾lular protein was used for each group); a mock reaction containing no
protein was included in each assay to establish a background activity
which, in turn, was subtracted from each experimental value. To en￾sure reproducibility, experiments were repeated three to six times,
using at least three different plasmid DNA preparations.
Statistical analysis. Unless stated otherwise, statistical differences
were evaluated by one-way ANOVA with the Newman-Keul’s test
for significance.
Results
Since ANP gene expression and secretion of the encoded pep￾tide product is purported to be one of the most sensitive mark￾ers of the hypertrophic process, we examined the effect of 1,25
(OH)2
 vitamin D3
 and RA on ET-stimulated secretion of this
peptide from cultured neonatal rat ventriculocyte cultures.
Neither all-trans RA, at concentrations known to occupy the

1580 Wu et al.
RXR receptor (41), nor 1,25 (OH)2
 vitamin D3
 had a signifi￾cant effect on basal irANP secretion when used alone; how￾ever, when used together [i.e., maximal concentration of RA
and increasing concentrations of 1,25 (OH)2
 vitamin D3
] there
was a significant reduction in hormone release which was max￾imal at 1028
 M 1,25 (OH)2
 vitamin D3
 (Fig. 1). As expected,
ET effected a significant increase in irANP release. This in￾crease was reversed in a dose-dependent fashion by 1,25
(OH)2
 vitamin D3
. Once again, the inclusion of RA amplified
the 1,25 (OH)2
 vitamin D3 effect, reducing secretory activity to
levels well below those seen in the basal state and similar to
those seen with 1,25 (OH)2
 vitamin D3
 and RA alone.
The effect on irANP release was at least partially related to
effects on hormone synthesis. As shown in Fig. 2, 1,25 (OH)2
vitamin D3
 effected a modest reduction in both basal and ET￾stimulated ANP mRNA levels in these cultures. All-trans RA,
on the other hand, had little effect on basal ANP gene expres￾sion yet reduced ET-stimulated ANP transcript levels by
. 50%. The combination of both agents together was not
more efficacious than RA alone.
As discussed above, expression of a number of other genes
is activated as a consequence of hypertrophy. Included within
this group are a-skeletal actin, an actin isoform which is pref￾erentially expressed in the fetal myocardium, and BNP (42).
Therefore, it was of interest to determine whether the pro￾nounced effects on ANP gene expression noted above could
be extrapolated to these other markers of hypertrophy. As
shown in Fig. 3, RA and to a lesser extent 1,25 (OH)2
 vitamin
D3 were effective inhibitors of ET-dependent increments in
BNP mRNA levels. The modest increments in basal transcript
levels seen in this autoradiograph after 1,25 (OH)2
 vitamin D3
or RA treatment were not reproducible in other experiments
(Fig. 3, bar graph at right). The combination of 1,25 (OH)2
 vi￾tamin D3
 and RA was only slightly more effective than RA
alone (P , 0.05) in suppressing BNP gene expression. In a
similar fashion, basal a-skeletal actin mRNA levels were only
slightly affected by 1,25 (OH)2
 vitamin D3
 or RA treatment
while ET provoked a large increase in expression (Fig. 3).
Both RA and 1,25 (OH)2
 vitamin D3
 fostered a truncation of
this ET effect and, in this case, the combination was clearly
more effective than either agent used alone (P , 0.01).
1,25 (OH)2
 Vitamin D3
 is a calcitropic hormone which fos￾ters calcium transport across the gut mucosa. It is also known
to alter calcium flux across the sarcolemmal membrane of the
cardiac myocyte (5) raising the possibility that the inhibitory
activity noted above could reflect a secondary effect of acceler￾ated calcium transport into or out of the cardiac myocyte. To
explore this possibility, we used OCT, a nonhypercalcemic an￾alogue of 1,25 (OH)2
 vitamin D3
 (43), in an effort to determine
whether the inhibitory effect would be preserved in the ab￾sence of these calcium-transporting properties. As shown in
Fig. 3, ET-stimulated a-skeletal actin gene expression was re￾duced equivalently by 1,25 (OH)2
 vitamin D3
 and OCT, and
these individual effects were amplified further by the addition
of all-trans RA. Similar levels of suppression of ET-stimulated
ANP and BNP mRNA levels were seen with the OCT/RA vs.
1,25 (OH)2
 vitamin D3
/RA combination (data not shown).
This suggests that the inhibitory effect of 1,25 (OH)2
 vitamin
D3
 on cardiac gene expression can be dissociated from its cal￾cium mobilizing activity.
As mentioned above, a number of protooncogene products
are also increased as a consequence of hypertrophy in the car￾diac myocyte (23). These immediate early gene products are
stimulated within a manner of minutes after application of a
variety of hypertrophic stimuli and may be linked to the activa￾tion of downstream events (e.g., transcription of the fetal gene
program) in the hypertrophic cascade (24, 25). To probe the
possible involvement of the inhibitory agonists in perturbing
very early responses to hypertrophic stimuli, we investigated
the effect of 1,25 (OH)2
 vitamin D3
 and/or all-trans RA on
ET-stimulated immediate early gene expression. As shown in
Fig. 4, ET increased levels of the c-fos, c-jun, and c-myc tran￾scripts severalfold. In no instance did 1,25 (OH)2
 vitamin D3
 or
RA, alone or in combination, have any effect on the expres￾sion of these protooncogene products. This argues for the se￾lectivity of the inhibitory activity seen with the marker gene
products described above and implies that reduction in imme￾diate early gene expression cannot be invoked to account for
the truncation of the ET-dependent activity.
In an effort to explore the mechanism(s) underlying the re￾duction in steady state levels of the ANP mRNA, we intro￾duced a chimeric hANP-CAT reporter into cardiac ventriculo￾Figure 2. Effect of 1,25 (OH)2

cytes before treating the cultures with 1,25 (OH)2
 vitamin D3
and/or all-trans RA. To amplify the effects of the latter, in se￾lected experiments we cotransfected expression plasmids en￾coding the human VDR, human RAR (RARa), or the human
RXR (RXRa). As shown in Fig. 5 A, 1,25 (OH)2
 vitamin D3
and all-trans RA effected a modest and dose-dependent reduc￾tion in hANP promoter activity which reached statistical sig￾nificance only at the highest concentrations of the individual
agonists (i.e., 30% inhibition at 1028
 M VD3
 and 33% inhibi￾tion at 1026
 M RA). When the two were used together, ampli￾fication of the inhibitory activity was seen, at least at lower ag￾onist concentrations. For example, while neither 10210 M VD3
nor 1029 M RA effected a significant reduction in promoter ac￾tivity, the combination reduced activity by 32% implying at
least additive and possibly synergistic interactions between
these two classes of agonists. Similarly, higher concentrations
of agonist (e.g., 1028
 M VD3 1 1026 M RA) displayed at least
additivity in the response. Cotransfection of either VDR or
RAR (Fig. 5 B) increased the response to ligand (i.e., 1,25
(OH)2
 vitamin D3
 and/or all-trans RA) only modestly (10–15%
in most instances) and, in this particular study (see Fig. 5, A
and B), was significant only at the highest agonist concentra￾tions [VD3
 (1028
 M) 1 VDR vs. VD3
 alone, P , 0.05; RA
(1026 M) 1 RAR vs. RA alone, P , 0.05]. Interestingly,
cotransfection of subsaturating concentrations of liganded
VDR [i.e., VDR 1 VD3
 (10210 M)] together with liganded
RAR led to a clear amplification of the inhibitory activity over
that seen with liganded RAR alone. This effect persisted to
some degree even at higher concentrations of liganded VDR
[i.e., VDR 1 VD3
 (1028
 M)] implying an important interaction
between these two classes of receptors. While cotransfection
of unliganded VDR and RXR, alone or in combination, re￾sulted in only modest changes in reporter activity, liganded
RXR (1025 M all-trans RA) was more effective than either
liganded VDR or liganded RAR in suppressing hANP pro￾moter activity (Fig. 5 C) and this effect, once again, was ampli￾fied in the presence of liganded VDR.
OCT had an effect on hANP-CAT reporter activity (Fig. 5
D) which was roughly equivalent to that seen with equimolar
concentrations of 1,25 (OH)2
 vitamin D3
 (compare with Fig. 5,
B and C) supporting the findings seen with the a-skeletal actin
transcript in Fig. 4 and suggesting that 1,25 (OH)2
 vitamin D3
activity in this system is largely independent of its calcium mo￾bilizing properties. 9-cis RA, which activates RXR at the dose
used here (1028
 M), provided a level of inhibition which was
roughly equivalent to that seen with the all-trans derivative
and, once again, there was an additional modest increase in the
inhibition when both ligand/receptor systems were activated in
parallel.
When the cotransfection analysis was extended to a human
BNP-CAT reporter system, very similar results were obtained
(Fig. 6 A). In this case the liganded VDR was more effective in
reducing reporter activity (vs. hANP-CAT reporter described
above) and, once again, the combination of 1,25 (OH)2
 vita￾min D3
 and RA resulted in an increase in inhibitory activity
above and beyond that seen with either of the individual ago￾nists alone. The a-skeletal actin–CAT reporter was suppressed
by the liganded VDR while the liganded RXR was devoid of
activity (Fig. 6 B); however, the combination of 1,25 (OH)2
 vi￾tamin D3
 and RA once more provided a level of inhibition
which was greater than that seen with either liganded receptor
alone. These findings suggest that liganded VDR and RXR are
capable of suppressing the expression of a number of hyper￾trophy-activatable genes and that this occurs, at least in part,
through a reduction in transcriptional activity. The inhibition
was specific to this subset of myocardial genes. When a re￾porter plasmid (DR3CAT) linking a conventional VDRE up￾stream from a TK promoter–driven CAT reporter (2109TK
CAT) was cotransfected into ventricular myocytes together
with liganded VDR and/or RXR, there was an increase rather

than a reduction in reporter expression (Fig. 6 C). Similar ex￾perimental manipulation had no effect on the 2109TK CAT
background vector. Taken together these studies provide sup￾port for the selectivity of the inhibitory effect.
In addition to the specific effects on gene expression noted
above, hypertrophy of the cardiac myocyte is accompanied by
an increase in protein and RNA synthesis, an increase in cell
size (14), and a reorganization of sarcomeric structure (16, 23).
ET as a surrogate stimulus for hypertrophy in vitro has been
shown to activate each of these responses in neonatal ventricu￾lar myocyte cultures (16). In an effort to extend the findings
presented above, we examined the effects of 1,25 (OH)2
 vita￾min D3
 and RA on [3H]leucine incorporation, as an index of
protein synthesis, in cultured ventricular myocytes. As shown
in Fig. 7 A, ET treatment of these cultures resulted in a signifi￾cant increase in [3H]leucine incorporation. This was reversed
in a dose-dependent fashion by increasing concentrations of
1,25 (OH)2
 vitamin D3
 after 48 h of treatment with the seco￾steroid. A more extensive time course (Fig. 7 B) revealed that
the inhibition was apparent at 24 h and maximal at the 48 h
time point. A point of potential concern here relates to possi￾ble 1,25 (OH)2
 vitamin D3
 effects on the growth and prolifera￾tion of nonmyocyte cells (e.g., cardiac fibroblasts which may
harbor VDRs) which routinely contaminate our cultures at
low levels. To address this concern we treated cultures en￾riched for the presence of cardiac fibroblasts (see Methods) ac￾cording to the same protocol used for the myocytes above. Of
interest, ET was effective in stimulating [3H]leucine incorpora￾tion into protein in these cells (Fig. 7 C); however, 1,25 (OH)2
vitamin D3 was unable to reverse this stimulation, suggesting
that the 1,25 (OH)2
 vitamin D3–dependent inhibition is largely
confined to the myocyte population in the heart.
Like 1,25 (OH)2
 vitamin D3
, RA had little effect on basal
[
3H]leucine incorporation (Fig. 8); however, it fostered a mod￾est, dose-dependent reduction in ET-stimulated protein syn￾thesis. The magnitude of this reduction was on the same order
(30%) as that seen with 1,25 (OH)2
 vitamin D3
. Once again,
the combination of 1,25 (OH)2
 vitamin D3 and RA displayed
improved efficacy versus either agent alone.
Finally, we sought to obtain a morphological correlate of
the biochemical data presented above. Previous studies using
an antiserum directed against the sarcomeric myosin light

chain-2 protein demonstrated that exposure of neonatal ven￾triculocytes to a hypertrophic stimulus resulted in an increase
in both the size and sarcomeric organization of the cells (23).
To approach this question in our system, we stained cells with
a fluorescein-labeled phalloidin tag both before and after
treatment with ET and in the presence or absence of 1,25
(OH)2
 vitamin D3
. Phalloidin is a mushroom toxin which selec￾tively decorates polymerized actin molecules in the cell (44). It
has been used successfully as a probe of cytoskeletal organiza￾tion in neonatal cardiac myocyte cultures (45). As shown in
Fig. 9, treatment of the cultures with ET resulted in an increase
in cell size and an increase in both the staining intensity and
the organization of the actin fibers in the cytoplasm of these
cells. While 1,25 (OH)2
 vitamin D3 alone had little effect on the
actin staining pattern in these cells, it caused a partial reversal
of the changes promoted by ET. There was a significant de￾crease in cell size; however, the staining intensity was not at￾tenuated significantly in the 1,25 (OH)2
 vitamin D3–treated
cells. Subsequent measurement of two-dimensional surface
area of individual cells in each of the four groups substantiated
the impression obtained from inspection of the photomicro￾ity. Freshly isolated ventricular myocytes were transfected with 20 mg 21150 hANP CAT alone or cotransfected together with VDR (5 mg) and/
or RXR (5 mg) expression vector. In each instance where exogenous receptor was expressed, the appropriate ligands (1028

Discussion
Reactivation of ANP secretion and ANP gene expression are
two of the most reliable early markers of hypertrophy in ven￾tricular myocytes (16–19). While a number of hemodynamic,
mechanical, and biochemical stimuli have demonstrated the
ability to activate ANP gene expression, as well as the down￾stream events in the cascade, until now there has been little in￾formation available regarding potential antagonists, particu￾larly endogenous antagonists, of hypertrophy. This study
suggests that retinoids and, to some extent, 1,25 (OH)2
 vitamin
D3 may play such a role. We have assessed hypertrophy
through a number of independent measurements including
changes in ANP secretion, changes in ANP, BNP, and a-skele￾tal actin mRNA levels and promoter activity, changes in
[
3H]leucine incorporation into protein, and changes in cell size
and cytoskeletal organization. In each case ET treatment pro￾vided a hypertrophy-like phenotype, and in each case 1,25
(OH)2
 vitamin D3 and/or RA abrogated this response.
Retinoids are small lipophilic molecules thought to play an
important part in growth and differentiation during develop￾ment. They bind with high affinity to one of two nuclear recep￾tor types called RAR and the RXR. Each of these, in turn, in￾cludes three different subtypes (a, b, g). RXR has drawn
particular attention of late by virtue of its ability to associate
with and amplify the activity of a number of different receptors
belonging to the thyroid hormone receptor family (2). Of rele￾vance to the present studies, RXR gene knockouts have been
shown to result in serious perturbations in cardiac morphogen￾esis in transgenic mice. Mice, homozygous for deletion of the
RXR locus, die between embryonic days 13.5 and 16.5 with
cardiac hypoplasia and presumed heart failure (9, 10). In some
instances these alterations in phenotype can also be found in
compound RAR knockouts (46). The developmental abnor￾malities are even more prominent in mice bearing deletions in
both the RAR and RXR loci (10), implying a convergence of
retinoid receptor signaling systems in establishing morphoge￾netic patterns in the developing cardiovascular system. The
retinoid receptors recognize different ligands with varying lev￾els of affinity. 1028
 M all-trans RA has been shown to be satu￾rating for the RAR (41). RXR, on the other hand, recognizes
9-cis RA as its natural ligand and does not bind all-trans RA to
a significant degree. At high concentrations (i.e., 1025 M) all￾trans RA activates RXR by virtue of low level chemical
isomerization of the agonist (i.e., conversion of all-trans to
9-cis RA) (41). By virtue of the high concentrations of all-trans
RA required to see the inhibitory effect and the greater effi￾cacy of cotransfected RXR versus RAR in amplifying this in￾hibition, we believe that RXR is the more potent of these two
receptors in mediating this phenomenon. However, it is clear
that liganded RAR, like RXR, is capable of augmenting the
response to liganded VDR and, of equal importance, this ef￾fect is apparent at RA concentrations which would be pre￾dicted to saturate RAR. Thus, several members of this ex￾tended nuclear receptor family appear capable of participating
in this regulatory phenomenon. The level of inhibition may de￾pend, in large part, on the nature of the individual receptor
components present in the heterodimeric complexes which
mediate this effect.
1,25 (OH)2
 Vitamin D3 has been noted to possess both
growth-promoting and growth-suppressant activity in different
systems. The direction of the response appears to be a function
both of the type of target cell under study and the characteris￾tics of the culture medium. In the cardiac myocyte 1,25 (OH)2
vitamin D3 displays predominantly suppressive activity, at least
under the conditions chosen for the present experiments. We
have not carried out an exhaustive investigation of 1,25 (OH)2
vitamin D3 activity under different culture conditions and it is
conceivable that the magnitude and/or direction of the effect
may vary as such conditions are modified.
It is somewhat surprising that the effect of 1,25 (OH)2
 vita￾min D3 on ANP, as well as BNP, mRNA levels was less than
that seen with RA since the two agonists were nearly equiva￾lent in suppressing ANP secretion, hANP promoter activity,
and [3H]leucine incorporation. We have no explanation for
this but it may suggest that these agents operate with variable
efficacy at several loci in the hypertrophic cascade. Thus, while
the phenotype of the cells is ultimately quite similar after treat￾ment with RA vs. 1,25 (OH)2
 vitamin D3
, the pathways which
they use to arrive at these phenotypes are to some degree
unique.
Previous studies have suggested a potentially important
role for 1,25 (OH)2
 vitamin D3 in cardiovascular function. Sev￾eral groups have identified VDRs in cardiac myocytes (3) and
1,25 (OH)2
 vitamin D3 has been shown to have significant ef￾fects on 45Ca21 flux in these cells (5). Receptors have also been
described in vascular smooth muscle cells, where 1,25 (OH)2

vitamin D3 plays a role in regulating protooncogene expres￾sion, cell growth, and mitogenesis (47, 48). The nature of the
regulatory activity in the latter case has been quite variable
with some studies reporting growth-promoting and others
growth-suppressing activity. As discussed above, this likely re￾flects differences in the culture conditions used for the individ￾ual experiments. Mitsuhashi et al. (47) reported that while 1,25
(OH)2
 vitamin D3 stimulated [3H]thymidine incorporation in
serum-starved vascular smooth muscle cells, it actually sup￾pressed synthesis which had been preactivated with epidermal
growth factor. The molecular underpinnings of this divergent
behavior remain undefined. VDRs are also present in vascular
endothelial cells and preliminary evidence (49) suggests that
these cells may also possess 1-hydroxylase activity [i.e., the ca￾pacity to synthesize 1,25 (OH)2
 vitamin D3
]. If confirmed, the
presence of such activity would raise the possibility of an im￾portant paracrine interaction between the endothelial lining of
the vasculature and neighboring vascular smooth muscle or
myocardial cells.
Weishaar et al. (7) reported that 1,25 (OH)2
 vitamin D3 de￾ficiency in otherwise intact rats results in an increase in periph￾eral vascular resistance, cardiac contractility, and blood pres￾sure. When these animals were provided with exogenous
calcium to correct the hypocalcemia which accompanied the

normalities persisted, implying that at least one physiological
consequence of 1,25 (OH)2
 vitamin D3 activity in the heart is
calcium independent. Our previous studies in atrial myocytes
showed that calcium was not necessary either for the inhibition
of irANP release or for suppression of hANP gene promoter
activity (26). This is corroborated in the present study by the
fact that OCT, a nonhypercalcemic analogue of 1,25 (OH)2
 vi￾tamin D3
, retains the ability to suppress both a-skeletal actin
mRNA levels and transcriptional activity of the hANP pro￾moter. Taken together these data suggest that at least a por￾tion of 1,25 (OH)2
 vitamin D3
 activity in the cardiac myocyte is
independent of its ability to effect changes in calcium trans￾port.
The mechanism underlying the suppression of genes in the
fetal gene program remains undefined. As noted previously
(26, 27), we have been unable to identify typical VDRE-like
structures in the proximal 59 FS of the hANP gene, a region
which covers sequence which is functionally sensitive to inhibi￾tion by 1,25 (OH)2
 vitamin D3
. Similarly, we have been unable
to demonstrate high-affinity association of radiolabeled VDR
with this region of the promoter (data not shown). This may
imply that the VDR effect is indirect, operating through an in￾termediate which, itself, displays more conventional VDRE￾dependent regulation. Alternatively, it may suggest that the
VDR (perhaps in concert with RXR) exerts its effects through
interaction with key positive regulatory proteins which are re￾quired for expression of each of the genes in the repertoire.
Very recently Zhou et al. (50) published a study which
bears directly on those presented here. They found that RA
suppressed phenylephrine-induced increments in ventricular
myocyte size, ANP gene expression, and rat ANP promoter
activity. They also found that the RA-mediated reduction in
cell size was not accompanied by suppression of phenyleph￾rine-mediated increases in myofibrillar organization. Our stud￾ies with 1,25 (OH)2
 vitamin D3
 demonstrated a similar reduc￾tion in cell size without alteration in ET-mediated cytoskeletal
organization. Of interest, while the RA-dependent inhibition
extended to both phenylephrine- and ET-activated hypertro￾phy, it was not effective in reversing serum-mediated hypertro￾phy, implying that these various stimuli may use different
mechanistic pathways to evoke a similar phenotypic response
in the cardiac myocyte. In contrast to our findings, Zhou et al.
(50) found that RAR was the more important of the two retin￾oid receptors in suppressing ANP promoter activity. This con￾clusion was based on greater efficiency of an RAR-selective
(TTTPB), versus RXR-selective (LG64), ligand in suppressing
phenylephrine-stimulated ANP promoter activity. As noted
above, based on the dose sensitivity of the response to all-trans
RA and greater efficacy of liganded RXR versus RAR in sup￾pressing hANP transcriptional activity, we believe that RXR
plays a major role in mediating RA-dependent suppression of
the hypertrophic phenotype. However, it is clear that in certain
experimental paradigms (e.g., in the presence of liganded
VDR) RAR can participate more actively in the inhibition
(see Fig. 5 C), perhaps reflecting its ability to form het￾erodimeric complexes with these heterologous receptors (51).
It is conceivable that at least part of the discrepancy between
the findings of Zhou et al. (50) and our own results from differ￾ential availability of as yet undefined heterodimeric partners in
the two culture systems. Finally, Zhou et al. (50) found no ef￾fect of vitamin D3
 in reversing the hypertrophic phenotype.
Our studies clearly show that this ligand does exert antihyper￾trophic activity which is qualitatively similar to that seen with
all-trans RA, although quantitatively, at least with regard to
selected markers of hypertrophy (e.g., ANP transcript levels),
RA appears to be the more potent of the two agonists.
In summary, our data indicate that many parameters asso￾ciated with the activation of hypertrophy in a cultured neona￾tal rat cardiac myocyte model are suppressed by 1,25 (OH)2
 vi￾tamin D3 and/or RA. This raises the intriguing possibility that
one (or both) of these agents, or a related ligand-receptor sys￾tem, may participate in the regulatory circuitry which controls
growth in the myocardium. Such involvement may suggest
novel pharmacological approaches for the management of hy￾pertrophy and remodeling in the heart.
