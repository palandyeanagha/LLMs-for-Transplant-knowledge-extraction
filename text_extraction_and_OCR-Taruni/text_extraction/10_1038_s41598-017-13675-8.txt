Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is an important cause of heart failure. Single gene mutations in at least 
50 genes have been proposed to account for 25–50% of DCM cases and up to 25% of inherited DCM 
has been attributed to truncating mutations in the sarcomeric structural protein titin (TTNtv). Whilst 
the primary molecular mechanism of some DCM-associated mutations in the contractile apparatus 
has been studied in vitro and in transgenic mice, the contractile defect in human heart muscle has not 
been studied. In this study we isolated cardiac myofibrils from 3 TTNtv mutants, and 3 with contractile 
protein mutations (TNNI3 K36Q, TNNC1 G159D and MYH7 E1426K) and measured their contractility 
and passive stiffness in comparison with donor heart muscle as a control. We found that the three 
contractile protein mutations but not the TTNtv mutations had faster relaxation kinetics. Passive 
stiffness was reduced about 38% in all the DCM mutant samples. However, there was no change 
in maximum force or the titin N2BA/N2B isoform ratio and there was no titin haploinsufficiency. 
The decrease in myofibril passive stiffness was a common feature in all hearts with DCM-associated 
mutations and may be causative of DCM.
Historically, the prevalence of DCM was considered to be in the range of 1 in 2500–3000, however, newer modalities 
and heightened diagnostic awareness now estimate the prevalence of DCM of up to 1 in 5001
. Dilated cardiomyo￾pathy is inherited in about 25–50% of cases and more than 50 single genes are linked to inherited DCM, including 
genes encoding cytoskeletal, Z-disc, nucleo-cytoskeletal, mitochondrial, and calcium handling proteins making DCM 
a genetically heterogeneous disease. However “pure” inherited DCM, not associated with other symptoms, such as con￾duction disease, is most often caused by mutations in sarcomeric proteins. Recently titin truncating (TTNtv) mutations 
have been found in 25% of putative familial DCM (fDCM) cases2
 and a disease causing role of these mutations in A 
band and Z-disk titin has been asserted3
. Despite the emerging importance of TTNtv mutations as a cause of familial 
DCM (fDCM) very little is known about the functional effects of the mutations in human heart muscle.

In a previous study of human heart tissue samples we identified 26 potentially disease-causing mutations in 14 
genes, 5 of which were in contractile proteins, 4 were in OBSCN and 6 were truncating mutations in the titin gene 
(TTNtv)4
. The high frequency of potentially disease-causing mutations in end-stage DCM patients confirms the 
finding of Roberts et al., who studied a large population and demonstrated a >96% probability of pathogenicity 
in end-stage DCM patients with TTN truncation mutations3
. In this study we have directly investigated TTNtv 
heterozygous mutations in human heart tissue samples in comparison with donor heart and DCM-causing muta￾tions in other sarcomeric proteins. Several human samples were analysed on total titin expression level, N2BA/
N2B isoform expression ratio, as well as titin phosphorylation level. To determine the mechanism of diastolic 
dysfunction, the maximum tension amplitude, length dependence of maximum force, and the rates of tension 
development and relaxation were measured in DCM samples carrying mutations in TTN (p. R23464T fs*41 and 
p. Y18923*), TNNI3 (K36Q), TNNC1 (G159D) and MYH7 (E1426K).
Results
Samples and sequences. A series of 30 explanted failing heart samples from selected patients with end￾stage heart failure, most of which were diagnosed with familial DCM, was analysed by whole exome sequencing. 
We found six unique variants in the TTN gene predicted to cause chain termination that are potentially causative 
of DCM4
. The presence of the variants was confirmed by direct sequencing (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table S1).
TTNtv mutations and contractile function. To investigate whether there was any mechanical dysfunc￾tion caused by putative DCM mutations we isolated cardiac myofibrils and measured their passive stiffness and 
contractility using an apparatus for single myofibril force studies. The three left ventricular TTNtv samples (D6, 
D7 and D9) were studied in comparison with myofibrils from donor heart and left ventricular muscle samples 
with mutations in contractile proteins of the sarcomere: troponin C (TnC) G159D, troponin I (TnI) K36Q and 
myosin heavy chain E1426K (D1, D2 and D15 respectively). These are termed familial DCM (fDCM) since link￾age has been proven with these mutations5–7
. Results are summarised in Table 1.

Maximum isometric force depended on sarcomere length, being about maximal at 2.2 µm. The mean max￾imum force in the donor heart muscle myofibrils was 112±7 kPa (n=18), reduced to 50±4 kPa (n=16) at 
1.8 µm sarcomere length (Fig. 2B and Supplementary Fig. S1). These values are comparable with previous meas￾urements from ourselves and others8,9
. In comparison, all the familial DCM muscle samples with contractile pro￾tein or TTNtv mutations produced the same maximum force at all three sarcomere lengths tested10,11, although 
there are some cases where force increases whilst Ca2+-sensitivity does not12.
Neither the activation (kACT and kTR) nor relaxation kinetics (tLIN, kLIN, kREL) were dependent on sarcomere length 
at maximally activating Ca2+ concentrations (Supplementary Fig. S1). This data suggests that sarcomere-length itself 
does not determine myosin crossbridge kinetics and number of force-generating myosin heads.
The rate of force increase following Ca2+ jump, kACT, was 0.78±0.06 s−1
 (n=26, SL=2.0µm) with the donor 
myofibrils, a value compatible with previous measurements, and was not significantly different in any of the DCM 
mutant heart myofibrils (TTNtv kACT=0.86±0.02 s−1
, 3 heart samples; other fDCM kACT=0.84±0.06 s−1
, 3 
heart samples). kTR, which measures the rate of active crossbridge attachment, was 0.64±0.03 s−1
 (n=25) for 
the donor heart myofibrils and very similar for the DCM mutant myofibrils (mean kTR=0.68±0.04); there was 
a trend to a slightly higher kTR in the mutant myofibrils that was statistically significant for D9 (1.16-fold higher) 
and D15 (1.18-fold higher). kTR was consistently lower than kACT, especially during the first contraction-relaxation 
cycle, however the difference was diminished with every new cycle. Fmax, after quick release-restretch, also did 
not fully recover. This shows that the state was progressively altered. Stretching may depress myofibril activation 
kinetics and force development in human cardiac myofibrils, but it is also possible that this effect could be related 
to a deterioration in the myofibril samples (Table 1).
Myofibrillar relaxation has a lag phase of almost constant force followed by an exponential decrease in force 
(Fig. 2A). In donor heart samples the duration of the slow phase was 100±6 ms and the rate of the fast relaxation 
phase was 17.1±1.2 s−1
. The TTNtv mutation myofibrils had rates of relaxation indistinguishable from donor but 
the three contractile protein fDCM mutations relaxed about 27% faster (Fig. 2C and D).
We then measured passive stiffness. Myofibrils in relaxing solution containing 30 mM BDM were stretched 
in several cumulative steps. We found that the slack sarcomere length was 1.91±0.02 µm (n=32) in the donor 
heart samples and was not significantly different in any of the mutant samples. The increase in passive tension 
with length was less than donor for all of the mutant samples. For the donor heart samples, the parameter A was 
559±38 kPa (n=32), corresponding to a Young’s modulus of 170 kPa at 2.2µm sarcomere length (Fig. 2G and H). 
We found substantial reductions in passive stiffness in all of the fDCM samples including the TTNtv mutants. On 
average the fDCM myofibrils had a 38% lower passive stiffness (Young’s modulus) (Fig. 2H).
Troponin function in TTNtv mutant hearts. Previous studies of heart samples with fDCM-related muta￾tions in thin filament proteins have indicated that the troponin is abnormal, with a consistent loss of modu￾lation of myofilament Ca2+-sensitivity by PKA-mediated phosphorylation of TnI at Ser 22 and 23 and it has 
been proposed that this uncoupling is sufficient to induce the DCM phenotype13,14. We therefore investigated the 
Ca2+-regulatory properties of phosphorylated and unphosphorylated troponin isolated from ventricular or atrial 
muscle using the in vitro motility assay. Donor heart troponin showed the normal modulation of Ca2+-sensitivity. 
Troponin from the heart samples with mutations in contractile proteins was uncoupled; this has been previously 
shown for TNNI3 K36Q and TNNC1 G159D in vitro14–16, but uncoupling due to a myosin heavy chain mutation 
(MYH7 E1426K) is novel. Three TTNtv heart samples showed normal modulation of Ca2+-sensitivity by TnI 
phosphorylation, while D6 and D7 showed a blunted relationship of TnI phosphorylation to Ca2+-sensitivity 
(Supplementary Fig. S2 and Table S2). This suggests that it is unlikely that un-coupling could be a primary cause 
of the DCM phenotype associated with titin mutations.

Titin expression and modification in human heart. In idiopathic heart failure it has been noted that 
the proportion of the less stiff N2BA isoform relative to N2B is increased and may therefore account for the 
reduced passive stiffness observed17,18. We found that there were no significant differences between the N2BA/
N2B ratio of donor heart or any of the mutant DCM heart muscle samples, although we did observe a higher ratio 
in myofibrils from idiopathic DCM as expected (Figs 3 and 4).
The study of Roberts et al. likewise found the same N2BA/N2B ratio in donor and TTNtv mutant muscle3
. We 
also investigated the possibility of reduced titin expression. Using methodology similar to that which previously 
identified obscurin haploinsufficiency, we compared donor heart myofibrils with the TTNtv samples and also 
with the other mutant DCM samples and found no significant haploinsufficiency either in myofibrils or whole 
tissue extracts19 (Fig. 4). Finally, using Pro-Q Diamond staining for phosphorylation that successfully identified 
hypophosphorylation of titin in HFpEF20 we found no systematic differences in the phosphorylation level of titin 
from donor, TTNtv or other mutant DCM myofibrils (Fig. 4). This finding does not exclude the possibility of 
equal and opposite changes of phosphorylation at the individual phosphorylation sites of titin.
Morphological findings. In ultrastructure studies, interstitial fibrosis was significantly increased in all the 
DCM samples compared to donor hearts, and TUNEL analysis showed strongly increased apoptosis of cardio￾myocytes in all the fDCM samples (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Table S3). Comparison of the sarcomere length in 
donor hearts with that in DCM heart samples did not show any consistent differences.
Discussion
We have performed a functional analysis of sarcomeric protein mutations using explanted tissue from patients 
with a diagnosis of fDCM. The mutations in TnC, TnI and myosin heavy chain have been studied in vitro and the 
familial dilated cardiomyopathy phenotype is well established5–7,15. In this study we have measured contractility 
and passive stiffness in human cardiac myofibrils with the sarcomeric fDCM mutations and also putative fDCM 
due to TTN truncating mutations3
.
Our measurements of the rate of donor myofibril activation are similar to those previously published; we 
observed a fast relaxation rate similar to9
 but considerably faster than reported by Poggesi’s group8
; the differences 
probably relate to different experimental conditions such as phosphate concentration, Ca2+ concentration and 
temperature.
The direct measurements of contractile function show that the DCM-related mutations studied here can be 
distinguished from human heart tissue with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). In contrast to the studies on 
human heart tissue from HCM patients21, we found the maximum isometric force was not diminished, and length 
dependent activation of maximal force was not altered in any of the DCM mutants. This is consistent with our 
detailed measurements using myofibrils from the ACTC E361G DCM transgenic mouse11,21–23.
It is also apparent that the contractile protein fDCM and TTNtv mutant phenotypes are distinct from idio￾pathic DCM or HFpEF since neither N2BA/N2B ratios or contractile protein and titin phosphorylation levels are 
different from donor heart3,17–19,24.
It is important to note that the changes in contractile properties of adult human tissue samples with TTNtv 
mutations are very different from TTNtv mutations incorporated into iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes which 
exhibit sharply reduced contractility, haploinsufficiency, expression of truncated peptides and decreased sarcom￾ere length25, none of which were observed in our adult myofibril samples. The different abnormalities in TTNtv 
hiPSC-CM and adult myofibrils is most likely due to the immaturity of iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes which func￾tionally resemble foetal muscles26. In contrast, the properties of muscle from transgenic mice with a heterozygous 
TTNtv mutation19,27 and our human heart samples are comparable, suggesting that human iPSC-derived cardio￾myocytes may indicate congenital effects of TTNtv mutations but do not reproduce the disease-causing process 
of DCM due to TTNtv observed in adult patients.
It is noteworthy that the DCM-associated mutations in contractile proteins are functionally distinct from 
DCM-related TTNtv mutant tissue. The faster relaxation rates of the contractile protein mutations D1, D2 and 
D15 suggest a reduced Ca2+-sensitivity, since kREL increases with increasing EC5011. This was not observed for 
the TTNtv mutations. In addition, uncoupling provides another potential causative mechanism for contractile 
protein mutations14,28. Several recent studies have demonstrated that mutations in thin filament proteins lead to 
uncoupling of TnI phosphorylation by protein kinase A from the change in Ca2+-sensitivity measured in isolated 
thin filaments and myofibrils. This leads to a blunting of the adrenergic response that was demonstrated to be 
sufficient to cause DCM under stress13,14,28. Whilst the contractile protein mutations in samples D1, D2 and D15 
showed uncoupling, uncoupling was not a consistent feature of the TTNtv mutations suggesting that it is unlikely 
that uncoupling contributes to the DCM phenotype associated with titin truncating mutations.
These studies confirm the expectation that familial DCM caused by mutations in different genes can work 
through a number of different mechanisms that cause loss of function, in contrast to the apparent single mecha￾nism for the gain of function in HCM.
The most striking abnormality found in our samples was a 38% reduced passive stiffness for all the fDCM 
samples. In the case of the TTNtv mutations this was the only functional abnormality we detected and is thus 
likely to be indicative of the disease-causing abnormality. Our data showing a decrease in passive stiffness are in 
accord with other studies, notably of samples from idiopathic DCM hearts, and it has been proposed that this 
phenomenon could be explained by an increased expression of the N2BA TTN isoform or altered titin phospho￾rylation levels17,18,20. In our fDCM and TTNtv samples we observed reduced passive stiffness with no difference 
in isoform expression (N2BA/N2B or presence of foetal isoforms) and no haploinsufficiency; nor was there incor￾poration of predicted truncated peptides into the myofibrils in common with other researchers3,19. There was 
no significant difference in overall titin phosphorylation level in the fDCM and TTNtv samples but we cannot 
exclude a change in the relative phosphorylation at sites in titin that enhance stiffness (PKC) and sites that reduce

stiffness (PKA, PKG)29. At present we have no explanation for why the fDCM mutations cause reduced passive 
stiffness other than the possibility of reduced Ca2+-sensitivity may promote relaxation. For the TTNtv mutations 
it is possible that the mutations cause changes in exon usage that modulate elasticity as was observed with RBM20
ablation30 whilst causing no detectable change in molecular size. It is likely that the decreased passive stiffness 
would have an effect when the heart muscle is shortening under load that would not be apparent in the isometric 
contraction31. Such changes could be related to disruption of the dynamics of myosin head activation by stretch 
leading to reduced contractility32 or alteration of the “slow force response” by modulating of mechanosensitive 
signalling pathways that affect [Ca2+]i homeostasis and promote apoptosis and fibrosis as observed in our sam￾ples33. In concert such processes could impair contractility and potentially trigger a DCM phenotype.

Materials and Methods
Human heart samples. We used anonymised tissue samples from explanted hearts in the Sydney Heart 
Bank34. Twenty-eight patients with a diagnosis of familial or idiopathic DCM requiring a heart transplant at a 
young age were selected for sequencing and further studies of which 13 are listed in Supplementary Table S1. 
As controls we studied muscle from eight donor hearts and two myectomy samples from patients with HCM. 
Donor hearts were obtained when no suitable transplant recipient was found. The donors had no history of 
cardiac disease, the hearts showed no structural cardiac pathology and had normal electrocardiogram and the 
heart ventricular function. Donor heart samples KN1 and KN2 were from University of Kentucky35. Patients 
were consented under ethical approvals obtained from the Australian Red Cross Blood Service (donor hearts) 
(HREC #2012/2814) and St Vincent’s Hospital, Darlinghurst, the University of Sydney (failing hearts: HREC 
#H91/048/1a; donor hearts: HREC #2016/923), and the University of Kentucky, USA (08–03338-F2L). The collec￾tion and use of control samples used for immunofluorescence microscopy was approved by the ethics committee 
of the Medical Council of the State of Hessen. The investigations conform to the principles of the Declaration of 
Helsinki. The functional characteristics of some of the donor heart and myectomy samples have been previously 
reported24,36 (see Supplementary Table S1).
Sequencing and gel electrophoresis. DNA extraction, whole exome sequencing, was performed as pre￾viously reported4,24,37–39.
Pyrosequencing. TTNtv mutations were confirmed by standard pyrosequencing according to manufac￾turer’s instructions on a PSQ™ 96 HS instrument (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and analyzed by pyrosequencing 
software.
Gel electrophoresis. Whole tissue extracts were obtained for gel electrophoresis using T-Per Protein extrac￾tion reagent (Thermo Scientific 78510) including 1 µg/ml E-64, chymostatin and leupeptin protease inhibitors 
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The myofibrillar fraction of heart muscle was prepared by our standard 
protocol24. For the best resolution myofibril samples were dissolved in gel buffer without heating. High molecular 
weight proteins were separated on 4–15% SDS-PAGE gradient gels (Criterion, Bio-Rad) with a running time of 
2.5hours at 100 volts or on 2% agarose/2% polyacrylamide “titin gels”.
To assess protein phosphorylation 4–15% SDS-PAGE gradient gels were stained with Pro-Q Diamond phos￾phoprotein specific stain followed by SYPRO Ruby total protein stain. Western blots were made in a wet blotting 
apparatus for 5hours at 250 milliamps at 4°C. Blotted proteins were reversibly stained with MemCode Reversible

stain kit (Thermo Scientific) and then probed with 9D10 monoclonal antibody to titin, specific to the I band 
region38 (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, Iowa) and visualised with ECL plus (GE Healthcare).
Titin gel preparation and electrophoresis. The method was slightly adapted from that of Tatsumi & 
Hattori39. Agarose (0.3 g) was stirred in 20 mls of deionized water and dissolved by heating in a microwave for 
1 min. The molten agarose was poured into a pre-warmed falcon tube (water bath set at 50 °C) and left to cool. 
The acrylamide solution was prepared as follows: 17.1ml (deionized water), 3.6ml 22.2% acrylamide (acrylamide: 
N,N’-methylenebiscarylamide=20:1), 4ml gel buffer (0.4M tris, 0.2M sodium acetate, 20mM EDTA, 1% SDS, 
pH 7.4) and 15% ammonium persulphate, 200µl (mixed in this order). The mixture was warmed in the water bath 
for 5mins. 13.3ml of the cooled agarose was added to the acrylamide solution and gently mixed, 30µl of TEMED 
was added to the acrylamide/agarose mix and gently inverted. The gel solution was rapidly poured into a glass 
gel cassette (approx. 80×75×1.5 mm) and the combs were added instantly. The gels were then cooled at 4 °C for 
7–10min, then returned to room temperature for 2hours. The samples were loaded and the gel was run at 4 °C at 
7.5mA for 30mins, then raised to 15mA (total time about 4hours).
Manipulation and measurement of TnI phosphorylation level. Troponin isolated from human 
heart samples was treated to change the level of phosphorylation. They were dephosphorylated by treatment 
with shrimp alkaline phosphatase (Sigma, P9088) or phosphorylated by treatment with protein kinase A (PKA) 
catalytic subunit (Sigma, P2645–400) as previously described14,40. TnI phosphorylation level in isolated troponin 
was measured by phosphate affinity SDS-PAGE as described by Messer et al.
41.
Quantitative in vitro motility assay. Troponin isolated from human heart samples was treated to 
change the level of phosphorylation (see above). Thin filaments were reconstituted with 10 nM rabbit skele￾tal muscle α-actin (labelled with TRITC phalloidin), tropomyosin (40–60nM) and troponin (60nM) to study 
Ca2+-regulation of filament motility14,42. Thin filament movement over a bed of immobilised rabbit fast skeletal 
muscle heavy meromyosin (100μg/ml) was compared in dual channel motility cells in which troponin varied by 
a single factor (mutation or phosphorylation state). The temperature was set to 29 °C. Filament movement was 
recorded and analysed as previously described43, yielding two parameters, the fraction of filaments moving and 
the speed of moving filaments. The fraction motile and the sliding speeds were measured over a range of Ca2+
concentrations to generate Ca2+-activation curves as shown previously14,44. The data were fitted to the 4-variable 
Hill equation to yield a value for EC50 and nH.
Mechanical measurements on myofibrils. The apparatus and methodology for the measurement of 
force and passive stiffness in single myofibrils has been described45. Single myofibrils were isolated from samples 
of human left ventricular tissue45 and kept on ice for use in experiments for up to 3 days. Myofibrils were isolated 
from the human heart samples and suspended horizontally using specially prepared microneedles. Contraction 
and relaxation were initiated by a rapid Ca2+ concentration jump achieved by a fast-solution switch system imple￾menting a double-barrelled micropipette moving across the mounted myofibril. Relaxing (0.01 µM Ca2+ or no 
added Ca2+) and activating (10 µM Ca2+) solutions contained (mM): MOPS 10, MgATP 5, free Mg2+ 1, DTT 5, 
phosphocreatine 10, creatine kinase (200 Units/mL), bacterial purine nucleoside phosphorylase (0.1 Units/mL), 
7-methylguanosine 0.3, pH 7.0. The Ca-EGTA: EGTA ratio was set to obtain 10mM total EGTA and the desired 
free [Ca2+]. Potassium propionate and sodium sulphate were added to adjust the ionic strength of the solution to 
200mM. The relaxing solution in the bath chamber was supplemented with (in μM): chymostatin 10, pepstatin 
5, leupeptin 40, E-64 10, PMSF 200. The rate of force increase at 10µM Ca2+, the maximum achieved isometric 
force, the rate of force regain after a quick release and re-stretch (kTR) and the slow and fast phase component 
rates of relaxation (tLIN, kLIN and kREL) at 0.01 µM Ca2+ were measured. Additionally, 30mM of 2,3-butanedione 
monoxime (BDM) was added to the relaxing solution with no added Ca2+ during myofibril passive stiffness meas￾urements. The experiments were performed at 17 °C.
Data were fitted using Levenberg-Marquardt nonlinear least square algorithm in LabVIEW. The rate constants 
for the exponential force development (kACT) and redevelopment (kTR) and for the fast phase of relaxation (kREL) 
were evaluated by curve-fitting using the equation ( ) y t( ) y y y k exp( t) = + plateau p 0− − lateau . The slow phase was 
fit with a linear fit and characterized by the rate constant kLIN calculated from the slope value of the linear fit by 
normalizing it to the maximum tension (kLIN m = −slopeF ax). A parabola σ ε( ) = Aε2
 was fit to the stress-strain 
data, where σ is stress and ε is strain (ε( ) L L = −( ) L L 0 0  , where L0 is slack sarcomere length). Young’s modulus 
was determined as the derivative of the function and is defined by the equation E A ( )ε ε = 2 . Statistics analysis 
(one-way ANOVA) and graphs were prepared using GraphPad Prism 6 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA).
Immunofluorescence microscopy. For these studies control tissues consisted of: LV samples from four 
patients subjected to subvalvular myectomy during surgical aortic valve replacement, and LV samples from two 
donor hearts with normal LV function which could not be used for transplantation. Patients with aortic valve 
stenosis showed preserved cardiac function (ejection fraction≥60%), and the resected myocardial tissue did not 
present signs of ischemic damage or myocardial hypertrophy.
5 μm cryosections were air dried and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. A rabbit polyclonal primary 
antibody against collagen I (Rockland) and a mouse monoclonal antibody against sarcomeric α-actinin 
(clone EA-53, Sigma) were used. Secondary detection system consisted of anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG 
and streptavidin linked Cy 3 (Amersham). TRITC Phalloidin was purchased from Sigma and used to stain 
F-actin; DAPI (nuclear staining) was purchased from Vector Laboratories. Apoptosis was analyzed using 
the in situ Cell Death Detection Kit (Roche, #116847959110) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

Tissue sections were examined by laser scanning confocal microscopy (Leica TCS SP2 and Leica TCS SP8). 
A series of confocal optical sections were taken using a Leica Plan Apo × 63/1.32 objective lens. After data 
acquisition, the images were transferred to a Windows 7 workstation for restoration and three-dimensional 
reconstruction using Imaris 7.7 multichannel image processing software (Bitplane, Zürich, Switzerland) 
described below.
Analysis of confocal microscopy. Quantification of collagen I was performed as described previously46,47. 
In brief, cryosections from at least two different levels in each tissue sample were used. All samples were immuno￾labeled simultaneously with identical conditions of fixation and dilutions of primary and secondary antibodies. 
Sections exposed to PBS instead of primary antibodies served as negative controls. For each heart at least 10 ran￾dom fields of vision were analyzed using image analysis (Leica) and Image J software (NIH). The quantification 
process was performed blinded to the type of section, having on the screen only one channel showing F-actin 
labelling. For each quantification, a specific confocal setting was established and kept constant in all measure￾ments. Quantification was performed by measurements of fluorescence intensity by using a range of 0 to 255 
grey values. The area of collagen I was calculated as percent of positive labelling per tissue area. Quantification of 
apoptotic cells was performed as described48. Sarcomere length was measured by intensity profiles of α-actinin in 
XYZ axes using the three-dimensional extended “Section” mode of the Imaris 7.7 program.
