Gut microbiota, an integral part of the human body, comprise bacteria, fungi, archaea,
and protozoa. There is consensus that the disruption of the gut microbiota (termed
“gut dysbiosis”) is influenced by host genetics, diet, antibiotics, and inflammation, and
it is closely linked to the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases, such as obesity and
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Macrophages are the key players in the maintenance
of tissue homeostasis by eliminating invading pathogens and exhibit extreme plasticity
of their phenotypes, such as M1 or M2, which have been demonstrated to exert pro￾and anti-inflammatory functions. Microbiota-derived metabolites, short-chain fatty acids
(SCFAs) and Gram-negative bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS), exert anti-inflammatory
or pro-inflammatory effects by acting on macrophages. Understanding the role of
macrophages in gut microbiota-inflammation interactions might provide us a novel
method for preventing and treating inflammatory diseases. In this review, we summarize
the recent research on the relationship between gut microbiota and inflammation and
discuss the important role of macrophages in this context.

INTRODUCTION
Gut microbes, an essential part of the microbiota ecosystem, outnumbers human cells by 10-fold
(Zhang et al., 2015). The gut microbiota contains bacteria, fungi, archaea, and protozoa and can
be altered by the host genetics, overuse of antibiotics, and changes in diet, as described in the
accompanying review (Belkaid and Hand, 2014; Pickard et al., 2017). The most abundant phyla
in human intestine were Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, and Actinobacteria (Tap et al.,
2009). Firmicutes are gram-positive bacteria including the large class of Clostridia and the lactic acid
bacteria. Lactic acid bacteria are marketed as probiotic which are benefit for human health. Another
sort of gram-positive bacteria are Actinobacteria, which include Collinsella and Bifidobacterium
spp. Bifidobacteria is the other probiotic, which has been made in functional foods. Conversely,
Bacteroidetes, and Proteobacteria are gram-negative bacteria, and LPS on their surface can induce
activation of macrophages toward pro-inflammatory phenotype. Both can cause infection or
diseases under certain conditions. The gut microbiota plays such a critical role in human health
and disease that it has been called the “forgotten organ” (O’Hara and Shanahan, 2006). During
millions of years of coevolution, the gut microbiota has been living in a symbiotic relationship

with the host and affecting the energy balance (Backhed et al.,
2004). In addition, symbiotic bacteria promote the intestinal
immune system maturity (Mazmanian et al., 2005) and protect
against pathogen colonization (Kaiser et al., 2012). Changes in
the gut microbial composition result in chronic inflammation
and metabolic dysfunction, as has been reviewed elsewhere
(Sommer and Backhed, 2013). It is worth noting that the
microbiota metabolites, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), play
a key role in colonic inflammation (Zeng et al., 2019). Many
studies have shown that not only epithelial cells or neutrophils
but also monocytes and macrophages are modulated by SCFAs
(Correa-Oliveira et al., 2016).
Inflammation is a normal physiological response of the body
to the foreign pathogen invasion and plays two conflicting
roles in human health (Xie et al., 2013). On the one hand,
inflammation is the body’s automatic defense response, which
also promotes wound healing. On the other hand, excessive
inflammatory response results in a series of diseases such as
obesity, atherosclerosis, and cancer, which has been reviewed
in elsewhere (Wellen and Hotamisligil, 2005; Galkina and Ley,
2009; Crusz and Balkwill, 2015). During acute inflammation,
neutrophils are recruited to the inflamed tissue sites, while during
chronic inflammation, lymphocytes, macrophages, and plasma
cells accumulate and infiltrate the junction tissue (Hakansson and
Molin, 2011). There is growing awareness that many prevalent
diseases are linked to chronic inflammation. Thus, it is important
to regulate inflammation in a timely manner to control the
morbidity from disease (Tracey, 2002).
Macrophages are regarded as critical effectors of
inflammation. Resident tissue macrophages perform specific
functions in response to their local environment (Hume et al.,
2002). For example, macrophages are Kupffer cells in the liver
and microglia in the central nervous system (CNS). Historically,
blood monocytes exit the blood, enter tissues and undergo
terminal differentiation to become tissue-resident macrophages
(Geissmann et al., 2010). More recently, evidence has shown that
tissue-resident macrophages, including lung macrophages and
Kupffer cells, are established before birth and complemented
by recruited monocytes under inflammatory conditions (Yona
et al., 2013). They express pattern recognition molecules, such
as Toll-like Receptor (TLR) 4, to recognize foreign pathogens,
remove foreign molecules, and protect against infection (Gordon,
2002). In addition, they respond to the inflammatory stimuli
and differentiate into classically (“M1”) or alternatively (“M2”)
activated macrophages. As reviewed by Hakansson and Molin
(2011) macrophages infiltrate tissues during inflammation
and perform major functions, including antigen presentation,
phagocytosis, and production of various cytokines and growth
factors to participate in immune regulation. It is worth
mentioning that macrophages are pro-inflammatory under the
Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) stimulation (Fujihara et al., 2003).
In this review, we summarize the current understanding of
the link between gut microbiota and inflammation focusing on
the roles of macrophages. In particular, we discuss two major
inflammatory diseases, obesity and inflammatory bowel disease
(IBD), and provide a description of the macrophages as the
immune and inflammatory effector cells.
GUT MICROBIOTA AND INFLAMMATION
The gut microbiota and its metabolites may regulate the
host inflammatory conditions (Yang et al., 2017; Feng et al.,
2018). Numerous studies have linked the gut microbiota to
inflammatory diseases. Forbes et al. (2018) have demonstrated
that the immune-mediated inflammatory diseases, such as
Crohn’s disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC), multiple sclerosis
(MS), and rheumatoid arthritis (RA), change the composition
of the gut microbiota. In addition, there are abundant reports
highlighting the gut microbiota role in the pathogenesis of
the inflammatory diseases such as asthma, type 1 and type 2
diabetes mellitus (DM), and obesity (Arrieta et al., 2015; Knip and
Siljander, 2016; Meijnikman et al., 2018).
The 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) sequencing paved the way for
comparing the gut microbiota composition among individuals,
which revealed the correlation between specific microbes and
disease (Supplementary Table S1). Enterobacteriaceae, a large
class of gram-negative facultative bacteria, are commonly linked
to many inflammation diseases like IBD and obesity (Zeng et al.,
2017). For example, adherent-invasive E. coli (AIEC) has been
associated with CD, while diffusely adherent E. coli (DAEC)
has been linked to UC (Mirsepasi-Lauridsen et al., 2019). In
addition, the depletion of the phyla Firmicutes and the increase
of the Proteobacteria populations have been linked to human IBD
(Matsuoka and Kanai, 2015). Moreover, an increase in the ratio of
Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes populations has been associated with
obesity (Turnbaugh et al., 2006). Zhang et al. (2013) reported
that the high levels of the phylum Firmicutes and the class
Clostridia are found in diabetic patients. Zhu et al. (2013) found
that children with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) had a
significantly higher proportion of Proteobacteria. Additionally,
the gut microbiota of the RA patients contained higher levels
of Lactobacillus and Prevotella copri and, correspondingly, the
numbers of Bifidobacteria and Bacteroides decreased (Liu et al.,
2013; Scher et al., 2013; Supplementary Table S1).
Short-chain fatty acids the major metabolic products of the
gut microbiota digestion of the non-absorbable dietary fiber
and resistant starches, included acetate, propionate, and butyrate
(Kles and Chang, 2006). In addition to providing energy for
the host, SCFAs exhibit anti-inflammatory effects via binding to
G-protein-coupled receptor 43 (GPR43) (Maslowski et al., 2009),
which is expressed in immune cells, including macrophages (Le
Poul et al., 2003; Sivaprakasam et al., 2016). Butyrate is the
most important SCFA due to its role in antagonizing colonic
inflammation (Hamer et al., 2008) and the ability to meet 6–
10% of the daily human energy requirements (Bergman, 1990).
Ruminococcaceae, Eubacterium, Clostridia, and Firmicutes were
identified as the main producers of butyrate (Ohira et al., 2017).
Moreover, butyrate can exert an anti-inflammatory effect in part
by suppressing the activation of NF-κB (Luhrs et al., 2002), a
transcription factor that regulates the inflammatory and innate
immune responses (Karin et al., 2002). In addition, butyrate
strongly inhibits the interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) signaling to
ameliorate inflammation (Klampfer et al., 2003). Butyrate also
targets peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ) to
prevent colon inflammation (Kinoshita et al., 2002).

MACROPHAGES AND INFLAMMATION
Macrophages have been considered to be the central effector
cells in many chronic inflammatory diseases (Moore and Tabas,
2011). Macrophages have high functional plasticity (Stout and
Suttles, 2004) and exhibit pro- or anti-inflammatory properties
in response to various cytokines and microbial products
(Mantovani et al., 2004). In the early 1990s, scientists found
that interleukin (IL)-4 exerts different effects on macrophage
phenotypes compared to IFN-γ and/or LPS, and the concept
of alternatively activated macrophages has been proposed (Stein
et al., 1992). Since then, macrophages have been divided into two
groups: classically activated M1 phenotypes, which are stimulated
by IFN-γ and LPS and exert pro-inflammatory effects, and
alternatively activated M2 phenotypes, which are stimulated by
the IL-4 or IL-13 and perform anti-inflammatory functions, as
reviewed by Tang et al. (2019).
Many studies have been focused on applying the macrophage
phenotype changes to the treatment of inflammatory diseases.
For instance, atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease
in which macrophages play a major role at all stages (Tabas
and Bornfeldt, 2016). Ouimet et al. (2015) reported that
miR-33 antagonizes atherosclerosis partly through promoting
the M2 macrophage polarization. In addition, macrophages

FIGURE 1 | Macrophages are involved in the interaction between gut microbiota and IBD or Obesity. (A) Under gut homeostasis, bone marrow derived Ly6C+
monocytes are constantly recruited to gut to replenish the intestinal macrophages (CD14− macrophages) which recognize the pathogen through TLR4 receptor and
secret anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 to promote Treg cell expansion. (B) In IBD, the inflammatory environment lead to gut dysbiosis included increased number of
AIEC which can survive and replicate in macrophages, and decreased butyrate bacteria like Ruminococcaceae, Eubacterium, Clostridia, and Firmicutes, which
impairs the ability of butyrate exert anti-inflammatory role through inhibiting HDACs/NF-κB (GPR43/41) or promoting IL-10 secretion (GPR109a). Additionally, blood
Ly6C+ monocytes are recruited to intestinal to become inflammatory macrophages (CX3CR1+ macrophages) and secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-23
and TNF-α to participated in inflammatory response. (C) In Obesity, the alteration of gut microbiota composition caused by HFD-diet lead to an increase of intestinal
permeability, therefore LPS enter system circulation (i.e., metabolic endotoxemia). Adipose tissue macrophages are response to LPS activation and transform to M1
phenotype.
are associated with obesity-associated inflammatory diseases
of the adipose tissue (Weisberg et al., 2003). A study by
Lumeng et al. (2007) illustrated that adipose tissue macrophages
(ATMs) switch from the M1 polarized macrophage to the M2
polarized macrophage, thereby reducing the adipose tissue￾derived inflammatory signals (Lumeng et al., 2007). Additionally,
the RA was found to be closely related to the imbalance of the M1
and M2 macrophages and could be attenuated by reestablishing
the macrophage equilibrium (Li et al., 2012). Identically, IBD
could be ameliorated via the M1 to M2 switch in the colitis
mouse model (Zhu et al., 2016). These findings suggest a strong
correlation between macrophages and the inflammatory diseases
and imply that macrophages participate in the inflammatory
process mainly by shifting from the pro-inflammatory (M1) to
anti-inflammatory (M2) phenotype (Porcheray et al., 2005).
MACROPHAGES ARE INVOLVED IN THE
INTERACTION BETWEEN THE GUT
MICROBIOTA AND OBESITY
Obesity is a state of low-grade chronic inflammation,
characterized by the expanded adipose tissue (AT) in which
macrophages account for 1–30% of its composition (Hauner,
2005). As reviewed by Russo and Lumeng (2018), adipose tissue
macrophages (ATMs) include tissue-resident and monocyte￾derived macrophages, and the increased number of ATMs in
AT is mainly due to the recruitment of blood-macrophages
and proliferation of resident macrophages. ATMs are the major
effectors of the adipose tissue inflammation; ATMs accumulate
in AT to participate in the inflammatory pathways, such as
increasing the adipose tissue production of pro-inflammatory
cytokines (Weisberg et al., 2003). Since scientists have found that
the composition of the gut microbiota is significantly different
between the lean mice and the obese mice, the latter showing
lower Bacteroidetes and higher Firmicutes bacteria (Ley et al.,
2005) levels, people began to realize the close connection between
the gut microbiota and obesity. Subsequently, the gut microbiota
has been found not only responsible for the weight gain and
energy harvest (Samuel et al., 2008), but also involved in the
development of the low-grade inflammation associated with
obesity (Cani and Delzenne, 2009).
Accumulating evidence indicates that alterations in the gut
microbiota are responsible for the progression of obesity. There
are two possible pathways of the gut microbiota affecting
obesity and the obesity-related diseases, such as diabetes and
cardiovascular diseases: the circulation of bacterial components
(e.g., LPS) and metabolites SCFAs (Harris et al., 2012) (Figure 1).

Wang et al. Macrophages, Gut Microbiota and Inflammation
The obesity-associated decrease in the Bifidobacterium levels
leads to the reduced production of GLP-2, a key molecule that
promotes the intestinal barrier function, eventually destroying
the tight junction integrity of the epithelial barrier and enhancing
the intestinal permeability (Cani et al., 2009). Under these
circumstances, LPS enters circulation through passive diffusion
across the intestinal mucosa (Harris et al., 2012). In addition,
Caesar et al. (2012) found that the conventionally raised (CONV￾R) mice showed increased plasma LPS concentrations compared
with the germ-free (GF) mice, both mildly obese. Moreover, gut￾derived LPS promoted macrophage accumulation in the adipose
tissue (Caesar et al., 2012) and increased the proliferation of the
ATMs via a CD14-dependent pathway (Luche et al., 2013). In
AT, macrophages recognized LPS through the TLR4 receptor,
which is expressed on the cell surface, thereby converting from
the M2 phenotype to the M1 phenotype and subsequently
secreting pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1β and TNF￾α, to participate in the inflammatory response (Weisberg et al.,
2003; Park et al., 2009; Harford et al., 2011). Similarly, some
reports reveal that the lack of TLR4 attenuates the adipose tissue
inflammation by shifting the ATM polarization toward the M2
phenotype (Orr et al., 2012). In addition, the level of SCFAs
was found to be higher in the obese compared with the normal￾weight children due to the differences in the gut microbiota
(Rahat-Rozenbloom et al., 2014; Riva et al., 2017). Conversely,
the HFD-fed mice displayed decreased SCFAs levels (Lu et al.,
2016). Abundant reports indicate that macrophages are involved
in the SCFA-mediated anti-inflammatory effects in obesity. For
example, propionic acid, a major SCFA, prevents the obesity￾related inflammation partially through acting on macrophages
(Al-Lahham et al., 2012). In vitro studies have demonstrated that
butyrate could inhibit the LPS-mediated macrophage migration
via the suppression of Src (Maa et al., 2010). Also, the circulating
acetate level was increased by the antibiotic use in HFD-fed
mice, reducing macrophage infiltration via activating AMPK
(Carvalho et al., 2012).
MACROPHAGES ARE INVOLVED IN THE
INTERACTION BETWEEN THE GUT
MICROBIOTA AND IBD
Inflammatory bowel disease, which includes UC and CD, is a
persistent inflammatory disorder of the intestine. It is becoming
increasingly appreciated that the gut dysbiosis is linked to
the pathogenesis of IBD (Ni et al., 2017). Under normal
conditions, the mucosal immune system is precisely controlled
to protect the intestines from the pathogenic bacteria infections
and simultaneously maintain the immunological tolerance to
benefit the gut microbiota, as described in the accompanying
review (Agace and McCoy, 2017). The disruption of normal
mucosal immunity toward the commensal microbiota leads
to continuous microbial antigenic stimulation and contributes
to chronic intestine inflammation (Strober et al., 2007). In
IBD, the numbers of the commensal bacteria (predominantly
Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes) were reduced (Frank et al., 2007),
and the numbers of the facultative anaerobic bacteria of the
family Enterobacteriaceae were increased (Zuo and Ng, 2018).
Furthermore, the levels of the microbiota metabolites, the
SCFAs, decreased along with the reduction in the population
of Clostridium IXa and IV groups, the main butyrate￾producing bacteria (Fava and Danese, 2011), limiting intestinal
inflammation by regulating the function of colonic T cells
(Tregs) (Smith et al., 2013). In a word, the inflammation￾related disruption of the host-microbe interactions and decrease
in the SCFA levels are involved in the development of
IBD (Figure 1).
Intestinal macrophages, which reside in the lamina propria,
are among the most abundant immune cells in the gut
(Lee et al., 1985) and the first line of defense against
the invasion of foreign pathogens (Smythies et al., 2005).
Unlike blood monocytes or other tissue-resident macrophages,
intestinal macrophages do not respond to LPS due to the
absence of CD14, a surface receptor that plays a key role
in the LPS-induced cell activation; hence, the LPS-induced
pro-inflammatory cytokine production (IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, and
TNF-α) is markedly reduced (Ulevitch and Tobias, 1995;
Smith et al., 2001; Smythies et al., 2005). Moreover, intestinal
macrophages produce anti-inflammatory cytokines like IL-10
and further regulate T-cell differentiation to prevent mucosal
auto-inflammation (Denning et al., 2007). Although human
intestinal macrophages exhibit profound “inflammatory anergy,”
they retain strong phagocytic activity and perform defense
functions (Smythies et al., 2005). Since intestinal macrophages
perform such essential functions, they are integral to maintaining
intestinal homeostasis. Kamada et al. (2008) identified a
unique CD-specific macrophage subset that expresses high
levels of CD14 and produces pro-inflammatory cytokines, such
as IL-23 and TNF-α, leading to the accumulation of pro￾inflammatory macrophages. In other words, there are “resident”
and “inflammatory” macrophages in the gut that share the
same Ly6Chi monocyte precursors under different conditions
(Bain et al., 2013).
Although there is a current consensus that gut dysbiosis is
closely linked to IBD, it should not be concluded that there
is a direct causal relationship between them (Ni et al., 2017).
However, it is clear that intestinal inflammation can alter the
composition of the gut microbiota, which further exacerbates
inflammation (Pickard et al., 2017). Macrophages are well
established as the innate immune system cells that recognize
invading microbiota using pattern recognition receptors and
exhibit efficient phagocytic and bactericidal activity (Janeway
and Medzhitov, 2002). Under normal conditions, intestinal
macrophages rely on the commensal microbiota for the immune
response, while in IBD, inflammatory macrophages are recruited
to the inflamed tissue (Grainger et al., 2017). Moreover, the
impaired acute inflammatory response in CD leads to the delayed
clearance of bacteria (Smith et al., 2009). Adherent-invasive
E. coli (AIEC), the aggressive functionally altered resident strains
in IBD, have the ability to invade intestinal epithelial cells
(IEC) (Sartor and Wu, 2017; Palmela et al., 2018). Subsequently,
AIEC is swallowed by macrophages and replicates inside them
due to the defect in autophagy (Lapaquette et al., 2010),
which is involved in the pathogenesis of IBD. Additionally,

Wang et al. Macrophages, Gut Microbiota and Inflammation
the SCFA butyrate can exert anti-inflammatory effects via
regulating the intestinal macrophage function as a histone
deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor (Chang et al., 2014) or suppressing
the NF-κB activation (Luhrs et al., 2002). Furthermore, butyrate
has the ability to exhibit anti-inflammatory activity on intestinal
macrophages, which express Gpr109a by inducing the expression
of IL-10 (Singh et al., 2014), while these functions are attenuated
in IBD due to the decrease of butyrate concentration.
CONCLUSION
This review provides current understanding of the role of
macrophages in gut microbiota and inflammation interactions.
On the one hand, the polarization of macrophages, mediated
by gut-derived LPS and its metabolites SCFA, plays a key
role in the regulation of inflammatory diseases. On the other
hand, macrophages are the main players in ensuring intestinal
homeostasis through pathogen recognition and elimination and
production of anti-inflammatory cytokines. Besides, a recent
report by Earley et al. (2018) revealed that a loss of intestinal
macrophages influenced the establishment of the gut microbiota
in zebrafish, which suggests a critical role of macrophages in
shaping the gut microbiota. Taking into account the important
role of macrophages in the relationship between gut microbiota
and inflammation, developing macrophage-targeting approaches
in the prevention and therapy of inflammatory diseases is an
appealing strategy. However, the related molecular signaling
pathways involved in the roles of macrophages between gut
microbiota and inflammation diseases are remained to be
defined. Further work is needed to apply macrophages as a
perspective target in the treatment of gut microbiota-related
inflammatory diseases, like obesity and non-alcoholic fatty liver.
