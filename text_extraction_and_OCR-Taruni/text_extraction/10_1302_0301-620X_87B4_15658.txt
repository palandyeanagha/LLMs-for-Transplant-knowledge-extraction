Abstract
Bone-marrow oedema can occur both in isolation and in association
with necrosis of bone, but it has not been shown whether each
respond to the same methods of treatment.
We treated 16 patients with isolated oedema and 17, in which it
was associated with necrosis of the proximal femur, with the
prostacyclin derivative iloprost, which has been shown to be
effective in the idiopathic form. The Harris hip score, the range of
movement, the extent of the oedema as measured by MRI, pain on a
visual analogue scale and patient satisfaction were recorded before
and subsequent to treatment.
In both groups, we were able to show a significant improvement (p
< 0.001) in these observations during the period of follow-up
indicating that iloprost will produce clinical improvement in both


circumstances.
