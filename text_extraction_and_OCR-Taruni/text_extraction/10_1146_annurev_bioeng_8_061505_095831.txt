Abstract
There is a wealth of new fluorescent reporter technologies for tagging of many cel￾lular and subcellular processes in vivo. This imposed contrast is now captured with
an increasing number of available imaging methods that offer new ways to visualize
and quantify fluorescent markers distributed in tissues. This is an evolving field of
imaging sciences that has already achieved major advances but is also facing important
challenges. It is nevertheless well poised to significantly impact the ways of biological
research, drug discovery, and clinical practice in the years to come. Herein, the most
pertinent technologies associated with in vivo noninvasive or minimally invasive fluo￾rescence imaging of tissues are summarized. Focus is given to small-animal imaging.
However, while a broad spectrum of fluorescence reporter technologies and imaging
methods are outlined, as necessary for biomedical research, and clinical translation
as well.

NIR: near-infrared INTRODUCTION
Optical imaging is unequivocally the most versatile and widely used visualization
modality in clinical practice and research. Long before modern discoveries, the
macroscopic observation of a patient has been the major means of medical diagnosis.
Similarly, since its inception almost 400 years ago, the microscope has immensely
contributed to the progress of biology and the life sciences. Microscopy remains a
diagnostic gold standard and a mostly flexible visualization tool, with new techniques
continuously emerging (for a few examples from a significantly large and diverse pool
of references, see 1–7). In parallel, macroscopic optical imaging has also emerged as a
powerful method for research and clinical practice, with applications spanning from
the recent decoding of the human genome and high-throughput screening to nonin￾vasive imaging of functional and molecular contrast in intact tissues (8–10). One of
the fundamental reasons to use optical imaging in biomedical research is the wealth
of contrast mechanisms that can be offered when exploiting the physical properties
of light (i.e., polarization, interference, etc.) and the ability to capitalize on a wide
range of light-tissue interactions and corresponding photophysical and photochem￾ical mechanisms and processes at the molecular level (i.e., multiphoton absorption,
second-harmonic generation, fluorescence, etc.). In addition, optical technologies of￾fer a convenient technology for experimentation: Most of the components required
can be assembled on the laboratory bench, are modular in design, and can be made
portable or compact. High quality of optical components and high detection sensi￾tivity can be achieved today at moderate cost. The utilization of such technologies
offers a highly versatile platform for biomedical interrogations that can be used to
probe at scales spanning from the molecular to the system level and yield important
insights into biology and research.
In recent years, fluorescence microscopy and imaging have received particular
attention. This is due to the increasing availability of fluorescent proteins, dyes,
and probes that enable the noninvasive study of gene expression, protein function,
protein-protein interactions, and a large number of cellular processes (11, 12). In
parallel, there is an increasing list of fluorescent imaging techniques that offer mi￾croscopic resolutions and video-rate scans (16–18), or methods that operate at res￾olutions beyond the diffraction limit and offer single-molecule sensitivity (13–15),
yielding unprecedented insights into biology. On the opposite side of the resolu￾tion range, macroscopic fluorescence imaging is gaining momentum as a molecular
imaging method for small-animal whole-body tissue interrogations. It has been long
known that light can propagate through several centimeters of tissue in the far-red and
near-infrared (NIR) (19). However, light becomes diffuse within a few millimeters of
propagation in tissues owing to elastic scattering experienced by photons when they
interact with various cellular components, such as the membranes and different or￾ganelles. Diffusion results in the loss of imaging resolution. Therefore, macroscopic
fluorescence imaging largely depends on spatially resolving and quantifying bulk sig￾nals from specific fluorescent entities reporting on cellular and molecular activity.
The combination of advanced macroscopic visualization methods with the abil￾ity to impart molecular contrast in vivo in whole tissues offers an exciting new tool

with large potential in basic research, drug discovery, and clinical application. One of
the most recent technological evolutions has been the development of fluorescence
tomography for investigations at the whole-animal or tissue level (20). These tech￾nologies allow for three-dimensional imaging of fluorescence biodistribution in whole
animals and account for tissue optical heterogeneity and the nonlinear dependence
of fluorescence intensity on depth and optical properties. Macroscopic fluorescence
imaging can be characterized according to (a) the fluorescent reporter technology
employed and (b) the imaging technology employed.
This review summarizes these fields for fluorescence imaging. Reporter tech￾nologies are further classified and briefly explained in the context of fluorescence
imaging, whereas excellent reviews of the subject also detail these approaches
(21–23). The subsequent section focuses on fluorescence imaging techniques for
in vivo imaging and, in particular, on macroscopic methodologies suited for whole￾animal and tissue imaging. Finally, the field is summarized and major future directions
are discussed.
REPORTER TECHNOLOGIES
Similar to other molecular imaging modalities (24), fluorescence molecular imaging
employs reporter technologies, i.e., methods that identify the molecular processes of
interest in vivo and quantitatively report on their presence using fluorescence. The
two major fluorescence reporter strategies are classified as (a) direct and (b) indirect
methods.
Direct Fluorescence Imaging
Direct imaging is associated with the administration of an engineered fluorescent
probe that targets a specific moiety such as a receptor or an enzyme. Fluorescent
probes for direct imaging are categorized as active or activatable.
Active probes. Active probes are essentially fluorochromes that are attached to an
affinity ligand specific for a certain target. This paradigm is similar to probe design
practices seen in nuclear imaging, except that a fluorochrome is used in the place
of the isotope. Examples of affinity ligands include monoclonal antibodies and an￾tibody fragments (25–27), modified or synthetic peptides (28–31), and labeled small
molecules (32, 33). A characteristic of active probes is that they fluoresce even if they
are not bound to the intended target and therefore may yield nonspecific background
signals unless long circulating times are allowed to efficiently remove the nonbound
probe from circulation.
Activatable probes. Activatable probes are molecules that carry quenched fluo￾rochromes (12, 34). The fluorochromes are usually arranged in close proximity to
each other so that they self-quench, or they are placed next to a quencher using
enzyme-specific peptide sequences (35). These peptide sequences can be cleaved in
the presence of the enzyme, thus freeing the fluorochromes that can then emit light

upon excitation. Such probes are also known as molecular beacons, optical switches,
or smart probes. Examples for identifying a series of proteases have been reported
for in vivo imaging (12, 36, 37) and several probe designs have been described (35).
In contrast to active probes, activatable probes minimize background signals because
they are essentially dark at the absence of the target and can improve contrast and
the detection sensitivity.
Fluorescence probes target specific cellular and subcellular events, and this ability
differentiates them from nonspecific dyes, such as indocyanine green (ICG), which
reveals generic functional characteristics such as vascular volume and permeability.
Fluorescence probes typically consist of the active component, which interacts with
the target (i.e., the affinity ligand or enzyme substrate); the reporting component
(i.e., the fluorescent dye or quantum dot used); and possibly a delivery vehicle (for
example, a biocompatible polymer), which ensures optimal biodistribution. An im￾portant characteristic in the design of active and activatable probes for in vivo is the
use of fluorochromes that operate in the NIR spectrum of optical energy. This is due
to the low light absorption that tissue exhibits in this spectral window, which makes
light penetration of several centimeters possible.
Indirect Fluorescence Imaging
Indirect imaging is a strategy that evolved from corresponding in vitro reporting
assays and is well suited to study gene expression and gene regulation. The most
common practice is the introduction of a transgene (called reporter gene) in the cell.
The transgene encodes for a fluorescent protein (FP), which acts as an intrinsically
produced reporter probe. Transcription of the gene leads to the production of the
FP, which can then be detected with optical imaging methods (38). Therefore, gene
expression and regulation is imaged indirectly by visualizing and quantifying the pres￾ence of FPs in tissues. Cells can be stably transfected to express FP and report on their
position for cell trafficking studies, or the transgene can be placed under promoters
of interest for studying regulation. In addition, fusing the FP encoding gene to a
gene of interest offers a platform for visualizing virtually every protein in vivo. This
approach yields a chimeric protein that maintains the functionality of the original
protein but is tagged with the FP so it can be visualized in vivo. It is also possible
to transcribe and separately translate the protein of interest and the FP under con￾trol of the same promoter using a transgene containing an internal ribosomal entry
site (IRES) between the genes encoding for the FP and the gene of interest (39).
Therefore the protein of interest remains intact while the FP still reports on gene
transcription. Several different fluorescent protein approaches have been developed
to allow interrogation of protein-protein interactions through the utilization of flu￾orescence energy transfer (FRET) techniques or protein function (40, 41), although
these techniques have been primarily associated with microscopy and not macroscopy.
Different reporter gene strategies have been reported for other imaging modalities,
such as positron emission tomography (PET) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
for example, when transcription of the reporter gene leads to upregulation of a re￾ceptor or enzyme, which in turn yields trapping or increased accumulation of an

extrinsically administered reporter probe (24, 42, 43). Such methods are less com￾mon to in vivo fluorescence imaging, although examples have been reported; for
instance, for b-galactosidase-based fluorescent probe activation (44).
The fluorescent proteins most commonly used are enhanced mutants of the green
fluorescent protein (GFP) isolated from the jellyfish Aequorea victoria and several
color-shifted variants (11). The development of red-shifted FPs has seen significant
progress over the past few years. Cloning of the red fluorescent protein (RFP) (45) and
evolution [some using exciting new methodologies such as somatic hypermutation
(46, 47)] has yielded a number of important new variants that emit well beyond the
600 nm barrier. Red-shifted proteins are beneficial for microscopy and small-animal
imaging because tissue yields reduced auto-fluorescence at longer wavelengths (48).
Therefore, better contrast can be achieved in the far-red and NIR (>600 nm). In
addition, tissue offers significantly less absorption (attenuation) of light in the far-red
and NIR compared with visible wavelengths; therefore, higher detection sensitivity
can be achieved in this spectral region. Although the best FPs reported so far still
require excitation within the highly absorbing visible region (<600 nm), the road is
paved toward further red-shifting FPs, and it is possible that true NIR mutants with
high efficiency and low toxicity will soon appear.
There is a wealth of applications using FPs in developmental biology (49), cancer
and stem cell research (50–54), immunology (55), and drug discovery (51), among
others. Reporter gene imaging is a generalizable platform where, in contrast to the
direct imaging method, only one or few well-validated reporter-gene and reporter
probe pairs can be used to image many different molecular and genetic processes.
On the downside of the method is the introduction of foreign proteins and genes,
which limits applicability to animals and perhaps gene therapy protocols. Indirect
optical imaging is also widely performed using bioluminescence imaging, in which
case light is intrinsically generated in tissues through chemilumescent reactions (56).
The field of bioluminescence imaging has been recently reviewed (57, 58) and more
information can be found in these excellent reviews and references therein.
IMAGING TECHNOLOGIES
Developing sensitive and accurate methods for fluorescence visualization is vital for
capitalizing on an increasing pool of efficient reporter technologies. In the following
section, we briefly outline the major technologies applied to in vivo fluorescence
imaging and concentrate on the emerging field of fluorescence tomography at the
macroscopic level and in particular on new trends and applications that can offer
superior visualization capacity.
In Vivo Microscopy
There are several exciting new technologies developed for visualizing fluorescence in
living tissues. Although much of the focus herein is on macroscopic imaging, we note
progress with microscopic methodologies for in vivo imaging. In particular, intravi￾tal confocal, two-photon, and multiphoton microscopies have yielded great insights

into biology by imaging fluorescent reporters with high resolution (0.5–3 microns) at
depths of several hundred microns under the surface (16, 18, 59). Intravital microscopy
can further characterize the efficiency of fluorescence or multimodality probes de￾veloped for macroscopic molecular imaging and characterize their specificity. This
can be based on observing dynamically the fluorescent probe microdistribution and
the particulars of binding or activation and subsequent immune and clearance re￾sponses as a function of time (60). Recently these technologies have been adapted to
flexible fiber probes that can be used with endoscopic methods for obtaining images
of sites that were previously inaccessible. In an approach developed by Mauna Kea
Technologies (Paris, France), light is guided into tens of thousands of optical fibers
enclosed in a miniaturized flexible probe to obtain confocal microscopy images of
∼2.5 µm lateral resolution and 15–20 µm axial resolution at depths up to 80 µm.
Some representative images from normal human alveoli and from tumoral vessels
obtained from a mouse prostate are shown in Figure 1. Technological developments
further allow for exciting new designs and improved imaging capacity. Wang et al.,
for example, has developed an in vivo confocal microscope employing a novel dual
axes architecture using two low-numerical aperture objectives oriented with the il￾lumination and collection beams crossed at an angle, as shown in Figure 2a, which
results in a significant reduction of the axial resolution and allows for long working

the cerebellum of a transgenic mouse that expresses GFP driven by a β-actin-CMV
promoter obtained with this setup (62). Combined with new MEMS technologies,
such flexible designs can soon propagate to portable applications as well.
Planar Imaging
The most common method to record fluorescence deeper from tissues is associated
with illuminating tissue with a plane wave, i.e., an expanded light beam, and then
collecting fluorescence signals emitted toward the camera. These methods can be
generally referred to as planar methods and can be applied in epi-illumination or
transillumination mode.
Epi-illumination (photographic) imaging. To noninvasively capture surface and
subsurface fluorescence activity from entire animals, it is possible to apply photo￾graphic techniques in fluorescence mode. The technique shines light onto tissue
surface and collects emitted light from the same side of tissue as shown in Figure 3a.
In analogy to microscopy, this method is termed epi-illumination, also known as flu￾orescence reflectance imaging (FRI). Owing to the diffusive nature of photons in
tissue, the light that reaches the surface will propagate for a few millimeters under
the surface, and if of appropriate wavelength, it can excite not only superficial but
also subsurface fluorochromes. The fluorescence emitted can be then captured with a

subcutaneous HT1080 tumors subcutaneously implanted in a female nude mouse
using a cathepsin-sensitive probe (34). Planar imaging attains the added advantage
that imaging of excised organs can be performed with the same instrumentation.
Epi-illumination methodologies combine simplicity of development and opera￾tion with high throughput. As such they have gained wide popularity and have aided
in significant advancements in the field of fluorescence molecular imaging (30, 32,
34, 37, 63, 64). Conversely, they come with some significant drawbacks because they
cannot resolve depth and they do not account for nonlinear dependencies of the signal
detected on propagation (depth) and the surrounding tissue (20). Therefore, although
the fluorescence intensity recorded depends linearly on fluorochrome concentration
(or fluorochrome amount present in a lesion), it has a strong nonlinear dependence
to lesion depth and to the optical properties of the lesion and the surrounding tissue
(65). For example, two tumors that have the same fluorochrome concentration but
different vasculature will report different fluorescence intensities, with the most vas￾cular tumor yielding lower fluorescence because of the increased absorption owing
to the higher hemoglobin concentration. Similarly, two otherwise identical tumors at
two different depths will report different fluorescence intensities in epi-illumination

imaging owing to the higher attenuation of the fluorescence signal detected from
the deeper tumor owing to the longer propagation of light to and from the lesion.
An additional limitation of the method is that superficial fluorescence activity may
reduce the contrast or “shield” underlying activity from being detected owing to the
simple projection viewing.
Transillumination imaging. Transillumination is an alternative method for planar
imaging. The technique shines light “through” the tissue, i.e., the source and the
detector are placed on the opposite sides of tissue, and the relative attenuation of
light (shadowgrams) or the fluorescence emitted is recorded. This approach is shown
in Figure 3b. Transillumination of attenuation was used as early as 1929 (66) for
imaging through the human breast (a technique also termed diaphanography) and has
propagated to this day by employing advanced illumination, detection, and scanning
techniques (67–69). Conversely, fluorescence transillumination is much less explored
and only recently received attention in dental research (70) and in imaging cardiac
muscle activity (71), and in small-animal imaging (72).

Transillumination images yield similar nonlinear dependencies to epi-illumination
images. A notable feature of transillumination though is that the volume of interest is
entirely sampled because light propagates through it. In contrast, there is significant
uncertainty on the exact depth sampled in epi-illumination imaging. In a recent study,
it was further shown that normalized transillumination data, i.e., transillumination
measurements at the emission wavelength divided by geometrically identical tran￾sillumination measurements at the excitation wavelength can yield certain benefits,
i.e., they can improve quantification and contrast (72). Figure 5 depicts examples of

Advanced approaches. Methodologies that capitalize on additional photonic prop￾erties to improve on the performance of standard planar methods have been in￾vestigated over the past few years. Reynolds et al. (73) applied light of modulated
intensity to localize exogenous fluorescent contrast agents and retrieve lifetime mea￾surements from tumors present in canine mammary gland tissues. In a different
approach, illumination using short pulses of light in a raster scan design has been
suggested as another route for retrieving depth (74). Although this methodology uses
a reflectance geometry, it borders with reflectance tomography as well because it em￾ploys point source-detector measurements. In addition, illumination with spatially
canceling sources has been considered for imaging of fluorescent agents deep in mice
(75). Significant attention has been also given to multispectral planar imaging as a
methodology to improve contrast over tissue auto-fluorescence (76). Alternatively,
the depth-dependent attenuation of different wavelengths has been suggested as a
method to resolve depth (77).
Tomographic Imaging
Optical tomography aims at three-dimensional reconstruction of the internal dis￾tribution of fluorochromes or chromophores in tissues based on light measurements
collected at the tissue boundary. The principle of operation resembles that of X-ray
computed tomography (CT), in that tissue is illuminated at different points or
projections and the collected light is used in combination with a mathematical
formulation that describes photon propagation in tissues. One point of distinction
of optical tomography compared with tomographic methods based on high energy
rays is that photons in the NIR or visible are highly scattered by tissue. This yields
a nonlinear dependence of the photon field φ detected on tissue optical properties
and source detector distance that has the following general dependence (78):
φ ∼ exp(−ikr)
r , (1)
where r is the source-detector distance assuming a point source and a point detector,
and k =  −cµa+iω
cD
1/2
is the propagation wavenumber of the photon wave that depends
on the absorption coefficient µa, the diffusion coefficient D, the speed of light c in
tissue, and the modulation frequency ω of the photon beam that illuminates the tissue.
For light of constant intensity ω = 0. Equation 1 describes a generic dependence that
does not account for the effects of heterogeneities or of boundaries, but illuminates
the complex nature of photon attenuation in tissues. The effects of boundaries fur￾ther contribute into altering photon propagation profiles resulting in a characteristic
“bending” of the equivalent macroscopic photon rays depending on the relevant posi￾tion of the source and the detector (see Figure 7d ). One of the key features of optical
tomography is that it is generally based on physical models of photon propagation and
therefore it does not only yield three-dimensional imaging and “deep-tissue” imaging

but also offers true quantification of optical contrast, which would be impossible to
obtain otherwise owing to the strong nonlinear dependencies of Equation 1.
Principles of tomographic optical imaging and the methodologies used for the
formulation of the theoretical model have been recently reviewed (10, 79). It is char￾acteristic that in contrast to other, more established imaging modalities, optimal
forward and inversion algorithms have not yet been unequivocally recognized among
the scientific community. This is partly due to the relative novelty of this field and
partly due to the challenges associated with the inversion of diffusive problems. This

computation aspect is open to finding optimal and efficient inversion methods that
work synergistically with new generations of hardware that collect large data sets.
Nevertheless, most of the mathematical problems used in tomography attempt to
model the photon propagation in tissues as a diffusive process, i.e., utilize solutions of
the diffusion equation. Because a higher number of spatial frequencies can be sampled
with a point source, most solutions are obtained for a point source and point detector
and form the basis for the forward problem by describing the expected response of
each detector for an assumed medium. In the following section, we outline some key
equations used in the tomographic problem following the analytical approach. Their
purpose is to give a flavor to the reader of the basic steps toward formulating an
optical tomography problem and is by no means exhaustive or descriptive of a wealth
of methods and approaches that have been described in the literature. However, for
the purposes of this review, a tomographic problem generally assumes a distribution
O(r) of an optical property; let us assume here for simplicity the absorption coefficient
around an average homogenous optical property value. Then an integral equation can
be reached that relates the measured field φsc to this optical property variation and
the field φ established in the medium owing to the source at rs (80, chapter 6), i.e.,

, (2)
where g(r, r
) is the greens function solution of the diffusion equation for a single
delta function at r
. In practice, this function indicates the attenuation of the photon
field when it propagates from position r to position r where the detector is placed,
bearing the dependencies seen in Equation 1. The field φ(r
, rs ) describes the photon
distribution inside the tissue and it is generally a function of φsc(r
, rs ) because this
photon distribution depends on O(r). To solve Equation 2 in an analytical manner,
a linearization is performed using an approximation such as the Born or the Rytov
approximation (80, 81). In both approximations, the quantity φ(r
, rs ) is essentially
assumed equal to the photon field φ0(r
, rs ) that is established by the source at rs in
a geometrically similar but optically homogenous medium with the average optical
properties of the tissue investigated. Equation 2 can then be written as
φsc(r, rs, ω) =

g(r, r
, ω)O(r
)φ0(r
, rs, ω)dr
, (3)
written herein in the Born approximation sense (a similar solution is reached for the
Rytov approximation case). Equation 3 describes a general derivation of a solution
from the diffusion equation assuming a small absorption heterogenous distribution
(absorption perturbation). Interestingly, solutions reached for scattering heterogene￾ity or solutions for a fluorescence distribution reach very similar expressions (65, 82).
For fluorescence, which is the major focus of this review, a linear dependence of the
fluorescence strength emitted from a volume element and the term O(r
)φ0(r
, rs )
exists (82). Then, the solution of a coupled set of two equations (65, 83, 84), one
describing the photon propagation at the excitation wavelength λex and one at the
emission wavelength λem, takes the simple form (82, 86)

which is virtually identical to Equation 3 except for two notable changes: (a) that
the green functions solution is now calculated for the emission wavelength and
(b) that the distribution of fluorescence O f is complex and depends on the mod￾ulation frequency as well as on the quantum yield γ, the extinction coefficient of the
dye ε, the fluorochrome concentration [F ], and the fluorochrome lifetime τ , i.e.,
O f

, ω) ∼ γε [F(r

Equations 3 and 4 can then be converted to a linear equation by discretization of
the volume of interest into a number N of volume elements (voxels)
φsc(r, rs ) = N
n=1
W(r, rn, r)O(rn), (6)
where W(r, rn, rs ) represents a “weight” that associates the effect of the optical prop￾erty O(rn) at position rn to a measurement at r owing to a source at rs. For a number of
measurements, M, a system of linear equations is then obtained, resulting in a matrix
equation
y = Wx, (7)
where W is the weight matrix, x represents the distribution O(rn) of optical property
in each of the N voxels assumed, and y is the corresponding measurement vector.
Calculation of the forward problem. In practice, the established photon field φ0
and the greens function solution g in Equations 3 and 4 are calculated for bounded
media using analytical (82, 86, 87) or numerical solutions (88–95). In addition, it is
possible to reach solutions of Equation 2, which is a more accurate description of the
forward field, by iteratively solving Equation 3 and updating φ0 in each iterative step.
Such solutions are generally implemented using numerical inversion schemes (96).
Furthermore, a number of experimentally validated methods have been proposed to
independently account for changes in propagation between excitation and emission
wavelengths (97) and offer elegant ways to handle experimental uncertainties and
noise in the data as well as prior information on image specifics (97–99).
A particular approach that improves accuracy and overall image quality is the
use of differential measurements. Fluorescence offers a significant advantage in that
respect: Fluorescence measurements can always be referenced to emission measure￾ments obtained under identical experimental characteristics by use of different filter
sets. One such approach that has facilitated the first in vivo demonstration of fluores￾cence tomography (100) is the use of the normalized Born approximation (87). Under
this method, Equation 4 is divided by a measurement at the emission wavelength and
the problem inverted is

Equation 4 did, i.e., O f . This approach has been shown to offer several experimental
and reconstruction advantages (87, 101), i.e., reduced sensitivity to theoretical in￾accuracies, unequal gain factors between different sources and detectors, and high
robustness in imaging even at highly optically heterogeneous backgrounds (102) as
is discussed in the following section.
While the use of the diffusion equation as a forward model is appropriate for a
variety of optical tomography schemes of tissues, there are cases where more accu￾rate forward models are required, especially when void (nondiffusive) regions intersect
photon propagation trajectories or when geometries using short source-detector sep￾arations are considered. For such regimes, solutions of the radiative transport equation
(86, 103) or diffusive solutions merged with radiosity principles have been proposed
(104). These algorithms generally come with high computational cost and the need to
select additional regularization parameters. However, experimental verification has
been performed in most of these methods, some also at in vivo imaging (105).
Inversion. Inversion of Equation 7 results in a so-called discrete ill-posed problem.
This means in the general sense that the problem needs to be treated with a regular￾ization process for efficient inversion. The literature is rich in methods for solving
such systems and solutions, and in these cases it is noted that as the more knowledge
on the model and the solution is available prior to inversion the more optimal the
reconstruction (106). Popular inversion methods include the use of singular value
decomposition methods, also in the form of direct inversion formulas (107), alge￾braic reconstruction techniques (80), Krylov subspace methods (79), Newton-based
methods (92, 108), hybrid methods (91), and more generally efficient minimization
methods that can be applied to large ill-posed inverse problems. To overcome the
ill-posed nature of the inverse problem, different regularization methods can be used.
Among the most popular is the Tikhonov regularization, which offers to minimize a
linear combination of the residual Wx − y2
2 and the weighted norm of the solution,
i.e.,
min
Wx − y2
2 + ax2


, (9)
where α is a parameter associated with the amount of regularization (smoothness)
of the solution. Equation 9 is equivalent to solving the following linear systems of
equations:
(W †
W + αI)x = W † y, (10)
where W † is the Hermitian conjugate of W and I is the matrix identity. Equations 9
and 10 are given as an example of a typical minimization problem used for inversion
assuming regularization, although different forms of functions can be constructed for
minimization also containing different forms of available prior information (10).
FLUORESCENCE MOLECULAR TOMOGRAPHY

transillumination) and yield a robust and quantitative modality for fluorescent re￾porters in vivo. Original tomographic systems and methods were based on the use of
fibers to couple light to and from tissue and the use of matching fluids to improve
fiber coupling or simplify the boundary conditions used in the forward problem.
Current trends wish to move away from such cumbersome systems when possible,
and implement flying spot illumination and CCD-based detection using noncontact
technology and multiview imaging. Such technologies can improve the image quality
offered compared with fiber-based and fluid-based tomographic systems. In the fol￾lowing, some key technological aspects of the enabling technology are outlined and
in vivo applications are showcased.
Illumination-Detection Domains
There are three basic ways to illuminate tissue (109, 110): (a) using light of constant
intensity, termed constant wave (CW) light; (b) using light of modulated intensity
typically at frequencies of 100MHz–1GHz; and (c) using ultrafast photon pulses in
the 100 fs–100 ps range. Correspondingly, the detection systems can either (a)resolve
changes of light attenuation, (b) measure changes in light attenuation and phase at
different frequencies, or (c) offer ultrafast detection of photon kinetics with resolu￾tions of the order of tenths of picoseconds or better. Some alternative approaches also
exist; for example, it is possible to employ light modulated in the few kilo-Hertz range
to filter out ambient light or to frequency multiplex several sources. Approaches us￾ing intensity-cancellation have also been reported (111, 112). In this technique, two
sources of modulated intensity of the same amplitude but at 180 phase difference
illuminate tissue simultaneously from separate points for increasing the sensitivity in
reconstructed images using phased-array detection approaches. As a generic rule of
thumb, time-domain and frequency domain implementations offer better differentia￾tion of absorption and scattering and can independently resolve fluorescence strength
and lifetime. For fluorescence biodistribution studies, constant wave technology may
be advantageous because it offers better signal-to-noise characteristics and is generally
operationally simpler and significantly more economic and robust (20).
Noncontact and Free-Space Technologies
Central to the new generation of systems developed for fluorescence tomography is
the utilization of noncontact measurements, i.e., measurements where the sources
and detectors utilized do not come in physical contact with the tissue (113, 114).
Besides the experimental simplicity that such a design entails compared with fiber￾based systems, it is further essential for collecting large information content and
high-quality data sets.
Noncontact technologies can be further combined with free-space approaches
developed to overcome the need for matching fluids and quantitatively detect and re￾construct optical signals collected from tissues of arbitrary placement and shape (115).
The techniques utilize surface measurements (for example, using photogrammetry)
to obtain the tissue surface and combine this information with the appropriate

theoretical models to obtain an accurate description of the forward model of photon
propagation in diffuse media and air (116, 117). It has been experimentally shown
that these methods can provide accurate reconstructions (117, 118) from phantoms
and animals. Figure 6a demonstrates an example of surface capture of a nude mouse.
Figure 6b demonstrated the simultaneous rendering of a captured surface and of the
reconstructed image of a fluorescent tube inserted into the esophagus of a euthanized
nude mouse (118). These techniques are essential for offering experimental simplicity
while allowing for multiprojection viewing and high-spatial sampling of photon fields.
Complete Projection Tomography
To achieve superior imaging performance, it is important to illuminate tissue using a
large number of projections and detect signal around the tissue boundary, similarly to
other tomographic techniques such as X-ray CT, PET, or SPECT. Typical geometries
employed for tomography are shown on Figure 7. Reflectance (Figure 7a) and
limited-angle projection (Figure 7b) approaches can be easily implemented using
simple theoretical models for modeling the boundary conditions. Noncontact and
free-space technologies, however, facilitate the theoretical mainframe to practically
implement a significantly larger number of projections (Figure 7c) for fluorescence
and more generally for diffuse optical tomography. Cylindrical geometries have been
implemented in the past using fibers for illumination and detection. However, the
combination of CCD-cameras and noncontact sources yield a superior data set and
improved imaging capacity.
We have recently implemented complete-projection tomography by rotating the
object of interest in front of the illumination path and used a CCD camera to collect a
number of projections, typically up to 72 with 0.5◦ rotational accuracy.Figure 8 shows
an imaging example, in this case also using photon pulses and time-gated detection
and utilizing only the early arriving photons of the photon profiles detected through
the diffuse medium (119). The image shown was experimentally obtained from a solid
phantom, made of polyester resin in which TiO2 particles and India Ink were added to
yield absorption and scattering. The phantom was cut in the cross-sectional shape of
a rectangle and a square as shown in Figure 8a and was immersed in a 1.5-cm-width
tank containing 1% intralipid solution and India Ink to yield absorption. The optical
properties of the intralipid-ink solution were µa = 0.1 cm−1 and µ
s = 7 cm−1,
whereas the solid phantom demonstrated eight times this background attenuation in
the early photon regime. Complete projection tomography was able to resolve not
only the location and size but also the shape of the phantoms (as seen in Figure 8b),
and this was the first report of shape reconstruction in diffuse imaging based on
experimental data. Limited projection viewing (as seen in Figure 8c) was unable to
accurately separate and resolve the volume and shape of the objects.
Handling Heterogeneity
A typical criticism for fluorescence tomography of tissues revolves around the effects
of tissue optical heterogeneity on reconstructed image quality and accuracy. This

is because the fluorescence intensity recorded at a tissue boundary is a coupled ef￾fect of the actual fluorochrome distribution and the tissue absorption and scattering
distribution and heterogeneity. For example, a fluorescent lesion that is close to a
highly absorbing organ appears attenuated depending on the viewing angle and may
be reconstructed distorted and erroneously quantified.
Most proposed methods to deal with optical heterogeneity are based on numer￾ical iterative solutions that generally solve the coupled diffusion equations, thereby,

explicitly reconstructing photon attenuation in tissues and accounting for these ef￾fects on the fluorescence inversion problem (97). The accuracy by which such meth￾ods perform experimentally in highly optically heterogeneous media has not been
widely validated. Alternatively, the normalized Born approximation has been recently
shown to minimize the sensitivity on background optical heterogeneity and yield ro￾bust reconstructions at highly heterogeneous media (87). In a recent experimental
validation the method was shown to be very accurate in fluorescent object localiza￾tion and achieve quantification accuracy within 20%, even for a significantly high
degree of background absorption heterogeneity (102). Higher sensitivity to hetero￾geneity was seen when translucent thin layers were introduced into the medium;
however, in all cases examined the method showed remarkable robustness and
accuracy.
Multimodality Approaches
Combination of modalities with complementing features is a very attractive strat￾egy in fluorescence tomography. Typically, fluorescence tomography offers depth￾dependent resolutions of several hundred microns to millimeters for small-animal
imaging (113), and this number worsens when imaging larger volumes. In addition,
fluorescence contrast is mainly functional or molecular. Therefore coregistration
with other modalities that reveal anatomy can be helpful in better understanding
the source of contrast. The simplest form of coregistration is by using the tissue
outline or surface, captured optically as shown on Figures 4, 5, and 6, for exam￾ple. However, combination with three-dimensional imaging modalities; for example,
X-ray CT or MRI can yield even more powerful findings by colocalizing anatomi￾cal and molecular contrast. Importantly, the anatomical modality can guide the in￾version problem by offering a priori information by which to better the solution.

IN VIVO FMT APPLICATIONS
Direct Imaging
In vivo fluorescence tomography is gaining significant momentum in small-animal
imaging to improve on quantification over planar imaging and to volumetrically image
fluorescence activity throughout the animal. Quantification is an important aspect in
macroscopic fluorescence imaging. Detection is based on the ability of probes to
outline specific molecular processes and diseases and not on high resolution. Much
of the information of interest is therefore contained in the determination of probe
accumulation. For these reasons, the application of FMT becomes important not
only in studies of deep-seated activity but also for superficial activity because it can
correct not only for depth-dependent attenuation but also for the effects of optical
properties.
Original FMT feasibility studies resolved proteases in animal brains using circu￾lar geometry and fiber-based systems (100). Newer generation prototypes based on
noncontact techniques have allowed superior imaging quality demonstrating subres￾olution imaging capacity (113) and sensitivity that reaches below a picomole of flu￾orescent dye (value reported for the Cy5.5 dye excited at 672 nm). Similarly, newer
systems based on flying spot illumination technology confirmed these sensitivity find￾ings and have reported further advances, such as rapid whole-body imaging (114). In
addition, the ability to tomographically image at the visible (126) or to offer com￾plete projection tomography (119, 127) has been showcased. Such advanced setups
have been used for imaging probe distribution (114), angiogenesis (128), proteases
(113), or the effects of chemotherapy on tumors (129). Figure 9 depicts a charac￾teristic result of the latter study where an annexin V–Cy5.5 probe showed higher
accumulation in tumors sensitive to cyclophosphamide treatment compared with tu￾mors resistant to this treatment. In another tomographic study shown in Figure 10a,
cypate-polypeptide fluorescent probe against breast-specific proteins was found to
localize in human MDA MB 361 breast cancer xenografts and in the kidneys of nude
mice (114).
These studies demonstrate the ability of FMT to resolve a variety of molecular
functions using exogenously administered fluorescent probes. Multispectral FMT
can further enhance the applications by simultaneously resolving multiple targets
(128) under identical physiological conditions. Although much of the tomographic
work so far has focused on tumors, the application to other disease models or biolog￾ical questions has also been demonstrated. For example, feasibility for imaging lung
inflammation has been recently reported (20) in small animals, whereas applications
in immunology or cardiology are imminent.
Indirect Imaging
Tomographic imaging of fluorescence proteins opens the exciting route to three￾dimensional imaging and visualization of gene expression and cell traffic in whole
animals; however, it comes with the inherent requirements that systems and meth￾ods developed operate in the visible (at least for the excitation part). One challenge

associated with this approach is that photon propagation models developed for the
NIR may not be accurate for propagation in the visible because the high absorption
coefficient of tissue at wavelengths shorter than 600 nm invalidates assumptions made
in the derivation of mathematical solutions developed for the NIR. Recently, forward
models and systems appropriate for the propagation profiles common in highly ab￾sorbing regimes have been experimentally demonstrated (130) and showed feasibility
to tomographically resolve FP-expressing cells and tumors in vivo (131). Figure 11
depicts in vivo imaging of a GFP-expressing lung tumor implanted in a nude mouse.
Correlative micro-CT confirmed the presence of the tumor, which was later verified
histologically as well. A concurrent rendering of the X-ray CT and the FMT data of
Figure 11 is shown in Figure 12. While the slab geometry employed in this study
offers limited resolution along the z-axis, complete projection systems could further
improve imaging characteristics. Overall, it is expected that the field of fluorescence
protein tomography will significantly grow, especially as all-NIR proteins may soon
become available.

DISCUSSION
Important new technological advances in fluorescence imaging and tomography come
with improved capacity for in vivo macroscopic observations. This new set of tech￾nologies, combined with an increasing pool of powerful new fluorescent molecular
probes and reporter strategies can significantly enhance the capacity to interrogate
in vivo an increasing number of targets, molecular function, and drug action. Even
though optical imaging is the oldest of imaging methods, molecular fluorescence
imaging is in its infancy, with strong potential but also several challenges. The wealth
of light manipulation and image formation one can achieve often with standard off￾the-bench components, and the complexities associated with the diffusive nature of
light propagation in tissues, currently leads to a field represented by a large number
of implementations and approaches. As such, it is an exciting but puzzling period
for optical imaging as well, owing to the lack of standardization and performance
comparison of the different approaches.
Advanced planar methods and tomographic methods will substitute standard pla￾nar imaging methods because the latter may lead to inaccurate and potentially mis￾leading observations. It is very probable that in the next few years we will see an
increasing propagation of CW methods combined with some physical model of

photon propagation, tomographic approaches, and spectral information into fluores￾cence investigation of animals. However, when lifetime measurements are important,
as a method to probe the local biochemical environment or as a contrast mechanism,
time-resolved methods or frequency domain methods will be necessary and become
the method of choice.
Independently of the exact photon domain used, a major challenge is the devel￾opment of efficient algorithms that combine the ability to invert large data sets while
maintaining robustness with data obtained from in vivo studies. Computation speed is
important as the sources and detectors of newer systems grow significantly. Advances

in algorithms and their implementation will play a major role over the next years in
further reducing fluorescence imaging, and more particularly tomography, to practi￾cal mainstream application.
These technologies are an important step forward in small-animal in vivo imaging
and the field will continue to improve in performance and application. These tools
are expected to play a major role in basic research, preclinical studies, and drug
discovery. Fluorescence scanners for in vivo tomography can be placed next to the
microscope and flow cytometer to equip the modern biological laboratory with in
vivo imaging capacity. Similarly, it can accelerate diagnostic agent and drug discovery
studies by offering the capacity for assessing the effect and fate of new probes and drugs
in vivo. Importantly, in vivo fluorescence methods offer the simplicity necessary for
wide propagation into the biomedical culture. The use of nonionizing radiation, the
ability to simultaneously image multiple targets based on spectral differentiation, and
the utilization of stable probes that can be easily stored and utilized for long and
repeated studies are some of the features that make fluorescence imaging a desirable
tool for many biomedical problems.
In addition to small-animal imaging, there has been some early work toward clini￾cal imaging, and this field is expected to grow significantly as some of the most potent
fluorescent probes gain approval for human use. There is a large application for these
advanced fluorescence methods in the clinical world, especially in fields of medicine
where the optical methods are already applied. For example, fluorescence molecular
imaging will play a major role in surgical procedures for outlining tumor borders
or for pinpointing a suspicious lymph node that has been identified in the abdomen
with a whole-body radiologic modality. Similarly, in endoscopic methods, exogenous
fluorescence contrast could play a significant role in diagnosis by identifying the
molecular onset of diseases and visualizing small disease foci and micrometastasis
that would be otherwise impossible to detect (132, 133). These approaches will most
possibly benefit from advanced epi-illumination methods that improve the detection
sensitivity and specificity over autofluorescence and light reflections and overall yield
better imaging performance. Similarly, intravital microscopy based on flexible fibers
probes can further help in improving the specificity of detection. Another exciting
application is optical mammography. Detection of breast cancer has been a primary
focus of optical tomography (67–69, 134–139) because the human breast is relatively
transparent to NIR light and high detection sensitivity can be optically achieved even
when imaging through the breast. Conversely, intrinsic tumor contrast is not ade￾quate for improving detection over X-ray mammography. Fluorescence tomography
can offer an interesting alternative, possibly as a follow-up study to improve detection
specificity but also as a method to monitor drug effectiveness and long-term treat￾ment. Importantly, it has been shown that detection of exogenous agents is possible
through the human breast in vivo (140, 141). Experimental studies also suggested
that volumes as low as 100 µl at physiologically relevant fluorochrome concentra￾tions could be detected through 10–12 cm through the human breast (142, 143), and
such observations have been further confirmed on realistic breast phantoms (144).
Overall, there is great promise that accurate fluorescence imaging methods would
grow and significantly propagate in the clinical practice as well.
