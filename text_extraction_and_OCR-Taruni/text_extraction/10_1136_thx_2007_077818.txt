Obliterative bronchiolitis (OB), the main cause of lung allograft
failure, is characterised by airway inflammation, neutrophilia,
remodelling and fibrosis. Recent studies of the macrolide antibiotic
azithromycin in OB, including one from our centre, have reported
improved lung function with rescue therapy.1 The mechanism for
this improvement remains unclear, but a recent study suggests that
neutrophilic inflammation may be an important predictor of clinical
response.2
Macrolides have anti-inflammatory properties in several pulmonary
conditions. We hypothesised that the clinical benefit observed with
azithromycin in patients undergoing lung transplantation may be


related to the inhibition of factors key to airway neutrophilic
inflammation, remodelling and fibrosis. The bronchial epithelium is
in a pivotal …
