SUMMARY
Bacterial infections in cirrhotic patients are common. There is a predisposition to intestinal
bacterial overgrowth, intestinal dysmotility, and increased intestinal permeability, all leading to
an increase in bacterial translocation. Bacterial translocation is the probable mechanism for some
of the most common infections in cirrhosis, such as spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, but is also
the source of bacterial byproducts such as endotoxin which can cause an increase in portal
pressure, impairment of liver function, and worsening of haemostasis.
The effects of bacterial infection and bacterial products on portal and systemic haemodynamics
in cirrhosis and clinical data on infection, from both retrospective and prospective studies of
variceal bleeding and other settings, demonstrate the importance of infection in pathophysio￾logical mechanisms in cirrhosis. This has been followed by recent clinical evidence that antibiotic
therapy reverses systemic vasodilation and prevents early variceal rebleeding.
c INTRODUCTION
In cirrhotic patients there is an increased susceptibility to bacterial infection, related to the degree
of liver dysfunction1 leading to several abnormalities of defence mechanisms, all of which
increase the susceptibility to infection, including deficiency of bactericidal and opsonic activities,
impaired monocyte function, depressed phagocytic activity of the reticuloendothelial system
(RES), defective chemotaxis, and low levels of complement in serum.
A particularly important role is played by the reduced RES activity, due to the presence of
extrahepatic and intrahepatic shunts through sinusoids without Kupffer cells, reduced number of
Kupffer cells, and impaired Kupffer cell function. Thus cirrhotics with impaired RES phagocytic
activity (as assessed by elimination of 99 m technetium-sulphur colloid) develop acute bacterial
infections more frequently than cirrhotics with normal RES phagocytic activity.2
Both community and hospital acquired bacterial infections are frequently diagnosed in
cirrhotics, most frequently spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), urinary tract infections,
pneumonia, and skin infections.3 Their incidence rises with worsening liver function.3
Importantly, half of these episodes are asymptomatic.1
Recently, bacterial infections and/or endotoxaemia have been associated with failure to control
variceal bleeding,4 more early variceal rebleeding,5 abnormalities in coagulation,6 7 vasodilatation
of the systemic vasculature,8 and worsening liver function.9 There has also been increased
recognition that bacterial infections are involved in several pathophysiological abnormalities in
cirrhosis. In this review we evaluate the potential mechanisms and clinical evidence illustrating
the pivotal role of bacterial infection. This could lead to new treatment strategies.
ENDOTOXAEMIA IN CIRRHOSIS
Endotoxaemia in liver disease, first described in 1970 in patients with biliary obstruction, is
frequently found in cirrhotics,10 even in the absence of any signs of sepsis. Thus higher endotoxin
concentrations are found in peripheral blood of cirrhotics than in normal subjects10 with a
statistically significant gradient between portal and peripheral blood,11 highlighting the role of the
bowel as the source of endotoxin. Both peripheral and portal levels of endotoxaemia are
correlated with the severity of liver disease10 11 which is a more important predictor of high plasma
endotoxin concentrations than portosystemic shunting or portal hypertension.10
BACTERIAL OVERGROWTH, ALTERED INTESTINAL MOTILITY, AND INCREASED
INTESTINAL PERMEABILITY
Altered small bowel motility, bacterial overgrowth in the small intestine, and increased intestinal
permeability all lead to increased endotoxaemia, increased bacterial translocation, and ultimately

the risk of bacterial infection in cirrhotics. In cirrhotic rats
with ascites, bacterial overgrowth is promoted by intestinal
hypomotility, and bacterial translocation only occurs in the
presence of overgrowth and severe disruption of the gut
barrier.12 In humans with cirrhosis, bacterial overgrowth has
been shown in one third of alcoholic cirrhotics, especially
those with ascites and severe liver dysfunction,13 and is
associated with reduced small bowel motility, hypochlorhy￾dria, decrease in intraluminal immunoglobulins, and reduced
secretion of IgA.14 There is also abnormal small bowel
colonisation by colonic bacteria. The altered small bowel
motility causes delayed intestinal transit which worsens with
increasing severity of liver disease.15 A coordinated bowel
motor function is probably the most important mechanism
for preventing bacterial overgrowth.12
Intestinal permeability is impaired by portal hypertension,
particularly with severe liver disease,16 especially if there is
ongoing alcohol intake.17 Gastrointestinal mucosal abnorm￾alities (leading to increased permeability) due to portal
hypertension14 can be caused by overproduction of nitric
oxide (NO), which leads to disruption of the integrity of the
intestinal epithelium.18 Intestinal permeability has been
assessed in 80 cirrhotics (mostly alcoholic): an increase in
permeability was correlated with the occurrence of septic
complications.16
SBP is a haematogeneous infection localising in ascitic
fluid, the source most likely being bacteria translocating from
the gut. A history of SBP is associated with more severe
intestinal dysmotility and more frequent bacterial over￾growth.14 Bacterial overgrowth leads to bacterial transloca￾tion and together with increased intestinal permeability leads
to an increased risk of SBP and worsening of hepatic
encephalopathy.19
Cisapride and antibiotics (such as norfloxacin and neomy￾cin) improve both small intestine dysmotility and bacterial
overgrowth in cirrhosis.20 Interestingly, propranolol, which
lowers portal pressure, reduced the risk of post surgical
infections from 42% to 15% in a cohort of 73 cirrhotics.21 This
protection is probably due to increasing bowel motility by its
sympatholytic action, indirectly decreasing microbial trans￾location. A recent retrospective study of 139 patients
suggested that propranolol may prevent SBP.22 Given these
data, propranolol may have another mode of action in
reducing variceal bleeding by preventing or reducing bacterial
translocation, thus reducing the frequency of infection which
may be a trigger for bleeding.23 At present, it is not known
whether probiotics (a live microbial supplement which
partially substitutes intestinal flora) alter bowel motility in
cirrhotics (see box 1).
BACTERIAL TRANSLOCATION
The term bacterial translocation was first coined in 197918
and was later defined as the passage of both viable and non￾viable microbes and microbial products, such as endotoxin,
from the intestinal lumen through the epithelial mucosa into
the mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs) and possibly other
organs.18 There are multiple routes by which an organism
could potentially translocate from the gut to extraintestinal
sites18 but in cirrhosis the intestinal macrophages play a key
role by carrying bacteria from the gut to MLNs.24 The
principal factors that normally prevent bacterial translocation
are the balance of intestinal bacterial populations (mainly
controlled by peristalsis), the integrity of the intestinal
barrier, and immunocompetence. In addition, decreased
killing of bacteria, rather than an increase in transepithelial
penetration, may increase colony forming units in the
MLNs,18 as most microbes breaching the epithelial barrier
are killed. Thus for bacterial translocation to become
clinically significant, failure of local and/or systemic immune
defence, as is commonly present in cirrhotics, is also
required.18
In animal cirrhotic models, bacterial translocation occurs
with an incidence ranging from 37% to 83%.18 Portal
hypertension is one factor determining bacterial transloca￾tion; the latter increases in cirrhotic rats after the develop￾ment of ascites25 but other factors also have a role, such as
reduced defences and bacterial overgrowth.26 A reduced
translocation rate is recorded in portal vein ligated rats with
chronic prehepatic portal hypertension but without parench￾ymal liver damage, which also have milder histological
changes in the bowel.26 In human cirrhosis, the incidence
of bacterial translocation is also related to the degree of portal
hypertension and liver dysfunction, reported in approxi￾mately 30–40% of cirrhotics with ascites,12 25 27 and more
frequently in Child C than in Child A and B cirrhosis.27
Only a few types of intestinal bacteria are able to
translocate into MLNs: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae,
other Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococci,
and some streptococci. These constitute up to three quarters
of microorganisms isolated in SBP.28 In cirrhotic rats, there is
frequent genotype identity between ileal flora and bacteria
colonising MLNs.29 In a recent study, seven of 17 advanced
cirrhotics with culture negative non-neutrocytic ascites had
the simultaneous presence of bacterial DNA in blood and
ascitic fluid at admission to hospital, which persisted in blood
for 24–72 hours.30 Furthermore, nucleotide sequencing
demonstrated that bacteria detected in the first sample
were identical to those detected later, proving that bacterial
translocation is a single species dynamic process.30 Cirrhotics
are also predisposed to other spontaneous infections in
addition to SBP by intestinal bacteria as a consequence of
bacterial translocation. Selective intestinal decontamina￾tion with antibiotics reduces bacterial translocation27 and
decreases the risk of infections, especially those due to Gram
negative bacteria.31 This again supports the role of intestinal
bacteria as a major infective source in cirrhotics and may
explain why prophylactic antibiotics both orally and intrave￾nously are so effective in reducing infections during variceal
bleeding.31

(TNF-a).32 NO itself may prime monocytes to endotoxin33 and
other biological mediators released by endothelial cells when
these are exposed to biomechanical stimuli, such as shear
stress in portal hypertension. In ascitic cirrhotics, monocytes
are spontaneously activated by enteric bacterial products to
produce TNF-a and contribute significantly to elevated serum
TNF-a.
34 In cirrhosis, in response to endotoxin, there is
increased release of TNF-a, interleukin (IL)-1, and IL-6 and
increased expression of CD11b/CD18 on the surface of
monocytes,33 not only due to the preactivation status
of monomacrophages but also to a reduced catabolism of
cytokines associated with hepatic dysfunction. Cirrhotics
with bacterial infection have very large concentrations of
endotoxin in the systemic circulation and a marked and
sustained increase in TNF-a and IL-6 concentrations.35 These
remain high for a longer time compared with non-infected
decompensated cirrhotics and non-cirrhotic infected
patients.35 Treatment with norfloxacin in 60 alcoholic ascitic
cirrhotics normalised the increased number of monocytes
and reduced their activated phenotype and their ability to
produce TNF-a.
34
As endotoxin is primarily removed by Kupffer cells, the
hepatic RES modulates most of the effects of endotoxin on
the liver (such as an increase in ICAM-1 expression on
hepatocytes, endothelial cells, and macrophages).36 Clinically,
increased endotoxin concentrations may lead to increased
disturbance of the systemic and regional circulations,
coagulopathy, and encephalopathy, resulting in both renal
and hepatic failure and ultimately death, in both chronic and
acute liver disease.37 38
INFLUENCE OF INFECTION ON HAEMODYNAMICS
Nitric oxide
Arterial vasodilation, particularly in the splanchnic circula￾tion, is a major pathogenetic factor for the hyperdynamic
circulatory syndrome in cirrhotics.39 There is also impaired
vascular contractility with hyporeactivity to vasoconstrictors40
due to overproduction of NO41 (its major source being
endothelial nitric oxide synthase (NOS)42) as well as other
mechanisms. Bacterial translocation, together with portosys￾temic shunting and reduced hepatic clearance, leads to
bacteria, endotoxins, and cytokines in the systemic circula￾tion,8 18 thus enhancing NO production in cirrhotic animals43
and humans.44 The latter occurs via a direct stimulatory effect
of endotoxin, and endotoxin induced secretion of cytokines
such as TNF-a, and via GTP-cyclohydrolase I which increases
tetrahydrobiopterin synthesis (an essential cofactor in the
synthesis of NO).45 This increase in NO further aggravates
arterial vasodilation in cirrhosis.8
Cirrhotics with bacterial translocation have haemodynamic
derangement, with lower systemic vascular resistance (SVR)
and higher cardiac output if endotoxaemia is present.10
Moreau et al observed that cirrhotics with septic shock had
lower vascular resistances than non cirrhotics with septic
shock.46 Concentrations of lipopolysaccharide binding protein
(LBP), a surrogate marker of endotoxaemia, are increased in
40% of ascitic cirrhotics, but not in non-ascitic cirrhotics.47
This suggests that the increased nitrate concentrations due to
endotoxaemia and bacterial translocation may be related to
worsening of portal hypertension and/or liver function. This
is in agreement with the finding that serum nitrate levels not
only correlate significantly with endotoxaemia but are also
increased in cirrhotics with ascites or kidney failure and are
associated with high plasma renin activity, aldosterone, and
antidiuretic hormone levels and low urinary sodium.48
Interestingly, selective intestinal decontamination can nor￾malise LBP levels, reduce renin and nitrate levels, and
increase SVR in cirrhotics, but not in those with normal
LBP.47 In another study, cirrhotics with high TNF-a concen￾trations in MLNs (suggesting bacterial translocation) had a
higher cardiac index and higher portal pressure.49 In rats with
portal hypertension, inhibition of TNF-a production was
accompanied by amelioration of the hyperdynamic syndrome
and even a decrease in portal pressure.50 These studies
suggest that endotoxaemia and bacterial infection can
exacerbate the haemodynamic alterations in cirrhosis, thus
leading to further worsening of portal hypertension via
activation of neurohumoral pathways and further fluid
retention in response to systemic vasodilatation. The correla￾tion between the presence of endotoxaemia or bacterial
translocation and worsening of the haemodynamic status
is confirmed by the fact that intestinal decontamination
reduces nitrate and endotoxin levels and vasodilation, both in
cirrhotic patients48 and in a rat cirrhotic model,51 in which
intestinal decontamination reduced the development of
ascites.51 In cirrhotic patients, basal forearm blood flow and
the vasoconstrictive effect of the NOS inhibitor NG-mono￾methyl-L-arginine was increased compared with controls but
returned to normal in cirrhotics after selective intestinal
decontamination with norfloxacin.52 In a recent study in 14
alcoholic cirrhotics,8 selective intestinal decontamination
reduced serum endotoxin concentrations and partially
reversed the chronic peripheral and systemic vasodilatation
by increasing SVR and mean arterial pressure and decreasing
cardiac output and forearm blood flow. Interestingly, hepatic
venous pressure gradient (HVPG) was also decreased by a
mean of 2.43 mm Hg,8 further strengthening the hypothesis
that bacterial products contribute to the hyperdynamic
circulation and portal hypertension in cirrhosis.
Cytokines
In addition to the direct effects of the release of vasoactive
mediators such as NO with regard to worsening of the
haemodynamic derangement in infected cirrhotics, release of
inflammatory mediators may also play a role. TNF-a is
involved in the pathogenesis of the hyperdynamic syndrome
in portal hypertension; the gut and its associated lymphoid
tissue produce and release TNF-a in response to bacterial
translocation even in the absence of portal or systemic spread
of bacteria. Vascular reactivity in cirrhotic rats with bacterial
translocation to the MLNs is more impaired than in those
without translocation and is most likely due to an increase in
endothelial NOS activity mediated by TNF-a.
43
Renal failure in SBP occurs in the setting of an intense
inflammatory response and is related to deteriorating
circulatory dysfunction (as shown by higher aldosterone
and norepinephrine levels and plasma renin activity)53; it is
the result of combined circulatory dysfunction of cirrhosis,
and of sepsis, leading to additional stimulation of the renin￾angiotensin system. Cirrhotics with SBP who develop renal
impairment have significantly higher ascitic fluid counts of
neutrophils and higher plasma and ascitic fluid concentra￾tions of TNF-a and IL-6, than those without renal impair￾ment.54 Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS), which is accompanied
by the most extreme haemodynamic derangement in
cirrhosis, is associated with increased concentrations of IL-6
and TNF-a compared with patients with liver failure and
normal renal function.55 After liver transplantation, IL-6 and

TNF-a levels return to near normal, concomitant with
improving renal function, suggesting that IL-6 and TNF-a
emanating from the liver play a role in HRS.55 This could be
either through TNF-a induced oxygen radical formation by
mesangial cells or through a TNF-a related increase in NO
by mesangial or endothelial cells.55 A further link between
inflammation and haemodynamic dysfunction is that cirrho￾tics with gross ascites have increased levels of C reactive
protein56 and that serum nitrate levels are correlated with
orosomucoid concentrations (a protein synthesised by the
liver in response to cytokines). Treatment with intravenous
albumin in addition to antibiotics reduces the likelihood of
renal impairment in SBP,57 not only by expansion of the
decreased plasma volume but possibly also by binding of
cytokines or NO by albumin58 or its antioxidant effect in
sepsis.58 Renal failure occurs frequently in patients with
variceal bleeding so that bacterial infection may contribute
directly to renal dysfunction over and above any hypotension
which can lead to acute tubular necrosis.
Endotoxin also stimulates the synthesis of endothelin,
renal production of thromboxane A2, and increases plasma
levels of leukotrienes, all of which act as renal vasoconstric￾tors.59 This release of vasodilators and renal vasoconstrictors
due to infection may be another factor contributing to the
development of renal impairment in SBP.59
Systemic and portal haemodynamics
The most consistent clinical data on the influence of bacterial
infection on systemic haemodynamics in cirrhotic patients
has been reported in the setting of SBP: renal impairment
develops in one third of patients,59 especially in those with
the most severe inflammation, as expressed by higher
concentrations of cytokines in plasma and ascites.53 54 SBP
is associated with worsening of haemodynamic status, as
shown by activation of the renin-angiotensin system54 caused
by the decrease in effective arterial blood volume as a result
of infection.54 59 Treatment with cefotaxime and albumin
compared with cefotaxime alone, leads to less renal impair￾ment and lower mortality, and lower levels of plasma renin
activity.57 Thus in SBP circulatory dysfunction develops which
may be prevented by albumin treatment. Recently, in another
study,53 wedged hepatic venous pressure and HVPG increased
(from 19.0 (2.6) to 23.6 (2.6) mm Hg; p,0.025) in eight
cirrhotic patients with SBP and renal failure despite a
decrease in effective arterial blood volume and systemic
vasodilatation. This emphasises the differential effect that
the same stimulus can have on the systemic and splanchnic
circulations. When SBP is associated with systemic circula￾tory dysfunction there is an increase in HVPG, which is
thought to be secondary to the action of endogenous
vasoconstrictors on vascular smooth muscle cells in small
venules and on activated hepatic stellate cells (myofibro￾blasts). In the setting of portal hypertension there is a relative
deficiency in NO in the intrahepatic circulation, thus
increasing the susceptibility to vasoconstriction.60
Endothelin and other vasoconstrictors
Endothelin 1 (ET-1) is the most potent mediator of stellate
cell contraction and in the liver ET-1 receptors predominate
in hepatic stellate cells, which have an important role in the
regulation of intrahepatic portal hypertension in cirrhosis.61
Both endotoxin itself and cytokines released in response to it,
are potent stimuli for the production of ET-1,23 which may act
in combination with cyclooxygenase products to increase
portal venous resistance during endotoxaemia.62 In the
cirrhotic liver there is greater induction of vasoconstrictor
(ET-1) over vasodilatory (NO, carbon monoxide) forces after
lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injection.63 There is a compromised
ability to upregulate sufficient vasodilatory forces to counter￾balance the constrictive effect of ET-1 following increases in
endotoxaemia, thus leading to increased intrahepatic
resistance. This would result in an acute increase in portal
pressure. Other vasoconstrictors such as angiotensin II and
norepinephrine lead to an increase in intrahepatic resistance
in rats and in in vitro models,64 leading to increased portal
pressure.53 These mediators are increased in cirrhosis and are
further augmented in response to the systemic vasodilatation
occurring in bacterial infection.
Thus if infection has a causal role in precipitating variceal
bleeding, then it could be acting via an increase in portal
and/or variceal pressure secondary to a rise in intrahepatic
resistance, as we have previously outlined as part of our
hypothesis suggesting infection could trigger variceal bleed￾ing.4
INFLUENCE OF INFECTION ON COAGULATION
Using thromboelastography (TEG), 20 cirrhotic patients who
had bled from varices and then suffered early rebleeding
were found to have a worse TEG trace on the day before
rebleeding compared with those who did not rebleed.65 TEG
parameters were also found to worsen in 84 decompensated
cirrhotic patients in the presence of bacterial infection.66 A
recent study found heparin activity in blood using heparinase
I modified TEG in 28 of 30 patients with bacterial infection,
but not in non-infected patients, and this effect disappeared
after resolution of infection; other coagulation parameters
were not modified significantly.6 This heparin activity was
subsequently found to be associated with anti-Xa concentra￾tions in many, although not all, patients, suggesting that the
heparinase effect is due to an endogenous low molecular
weight heparin.7 Moreover, a heparin effect was reported
immediately after acute variceal bleeding in cirrhotics and
thus could contribute to failure to control acute bleeding and
early rebleeding.67
In a single study, plasma heparan sulphate concentrations
were significantly raised in patients with recent variceal
bleeding compared with those without bleeding or non￾cirrhotic patients.68 Endotoxin or cytokines could release
heparinoids from endothelium in a dose dependent manner6
and mast cell activation due to bacterial infection could also
release heparin. Mast cells and activated endothelial cells are
also able to release tissue plasminogen activator, which
induces fibrinolysis.6
Sepsis causes defects in platelet aggregation,69 and this may
constitute another reason for impairment of the haemostatic
process in cirrhotics, either via a decrease in platelet
aggregation due to NO or due to the fact that endotoxin
and ET-1 can impair platelet aggregation through release of
prostacyclin.
Production of cytokines in the presence of bacterial
infection can lead to activation of clotting factors and
fibrinolysis.70 In 30% of patients with advanced liver disease,
accelerated intravascular coagulation and fibrinolysis has
been shown, and these patients are prone to develop
disseminated vascular coagulation (DIC) if sepsis occurs.71
Hyperfibrinolysis was directly associated with gastrointest￾inal haemorrhage in cirrhotic patients71; unfortunately, the
presence of infection was not documented in these studies.

Bleeding from oesophageal varices has some correlation with
the circadian rhythm of fibrinolysis in cirrhotics.71 Features of
DIC have been reported in cirrhotic patients with variceal
haemorrhage, especially in those who die of continued
bleeding,72 where multiple transfusions may be a confound￾ing factor. However, there is little evidence for DIC occurring
as a primary event in cirrhosis.73 In 41 cirrhotics, a study
found a strong association between endotoxaemia and high
plasma levels of prothrombin fragment F1+2 and D-dimer (a
pattern suggestive of secondary fibrinolysis) which interest￾ingly then returned to normal after administration of non￾absorbable antibiotics.74 A recent report showed a lower
protein C activity in cirrhotics with severe sepsis compared
with those with non-severe sepsis or without sepsis; this
deficiency in protein C activity is associated with a significant
inflammatory response and DIC.75
INFLUENCE OF INFECTION ON LIVER DAMAGE
Normal liver microcirculatory function is maintained by a
balance of vasoconstrictors (ET-1) and vasodilators (NO,
carbon monoxide).63 Both endotoxaemia and cytokines such
as TNF-a and IL-1 cause hepatic necrosis by disruption of the
microcirculation, the alteration in the microcirculation due to
endotoxin being mediated via Kupffer cells76 in several
experimental models of liver failure via infiltration of
leucocytes. These are a source of reactive oxygen species as
well as nitrogen species,77 leading to lipid peroxidation in the
liver and secondary damage to hepatocytes. Kupffer cells play
a pivotal role in endotoxin induced hepatic injury. LPS
triggers production of IL-1b, TNF-a, IL-12, and IL-18 from
Kupffer cells, IFN-c from hepatic lymphocytes, and induces
Fas-Ligand on the surface of NK cells, all leading to acute
hepatic injury. TNF-a is hepatotoxic in itself, inducing the
apoptosis of hepatocytes. LPS induced liver failure in mice is
prevented by inhibition of nuclear factor kB, thereby
decreasing cytokine production.78 In addition, hepatocytes
have membrane receptors for both endotoxin and the lipid A
component of LPS, thus offering another possible pathway
for liver injury.79
Antibiotic treatment prevents early liver injury caused by
ethanol in rats80 and both cisapride and antibiotics improve
liver function in cirrhotic patients,20 strongly suggesting that
bacterial products via translocation can worsen liver function.
Other clinical evidence also suggests that liver function may
be worsened by bacterial infections. Indeed, infections can
aggravate liver dysfunction in patients with cirrhosis,9 81 and
severe liver failure occurs in most patients with cirrhosis and
septic shock.46 Thus sepsis may affect liver function indepen￾dent of its haemodynamic effects.
CLINICAL EVIDENCE LINKING BACTERIAL
INFECTION TO VARICEAL HAEMORRHAGE
Bacterial infections are frequently associated with upper
gastrointestinal bleeding in cirrhotic patients,4 31 developing
in up to 66% (20% within the first 48 hours, 35–66% within
two weeks).4 About two thirds of these infections are present
at hospital admission while the remaining third develop
during admission.1 Moreover, bacterial infections are more
common in cirrhotic patients with acute variceal bleeding
than in those admitted to hospital with other forms of
decompensation, such as encephalopathy (see box 2).1
Our group showed that proven bacterial infection, or a
surrogate of its presence (use of antibiotics), had the
strongest independent association with failure to control
bleeding in cirrhotic patients with variceal bleeding, even
stronger than active bleeding at endoscopy and severity of
liver disease.4 Recently, a prospective survey of 1037 cirrhotics
reported that the 297 patients with proven infection had a
fourfold increase in the incidence of gastrointestinal bleeding
(8% v 2%; p,0.001) compared with 346 known not to have
bacterial infection, and that infection was independently
associated with the occurrence of gastrointestinal haemor￾rhage.82 The strong association between infection and variceal
bleeding in cirrhotics has been confirmed in several studies:
association with failure to control bleeding,4 83 early rebleed￾ing,4 and mortality.83 A recent meta-analysis confirmed that
antibiotic prophylaxis prevented infections in cirrhotic
patients with gastrointestinal bleeding and significantly
increased the short term survival rate.31 The improvement
in mortality was equivalent to that seen with terlipressin. In a
very recent randomised study of 120 patients, prophylactic
ofloxacin compared with on demand antibiotics was shown
to prevent early rebleeding (24% v 64%; p,0.01) and to
decrease the amount of blood transfused (1.40 (0.89) v 2.81
(2.29) units; p,0.05), in addition to preventing bacterial
infections.5 Therefore, since our hypothesis was published,23
there are now a number of publications strongly suggesting a
causal link between the presence of an infection and
initiation of acute variceal bleeding and its associated early
rebleeding, supporting our hypothesis.
Worsening of liver function is a recognised risk factor for
first variceal bleeding84 so that infection may contribute to
this risk, or indeed be a trigger for variceal haemorrhage,
particularly as the liver damage occurring in sepsis may itself
contribute to an acute increase in portal hypertension. The
risk of portal hypertensive related bleeding in cirrhotic
patients is related to the degree of portal hypertension, liver
dysfunction, and to the size and endoscopic appearance of
varices.84 However, trigger factors are not known. In the
Box 2 Clinical evidence linking infection to
variceal bleeding in cirrhotics
c Bacterial infections are common in cirrhotic patients with
variceal haemorrhage
c Infection is independently associated with gastrointestinal
haemorrhage in cirrhotics
c Infection is associated with failure to control variceal
bleeding and early variceal rebleeding in these patients
c Prophylactic antibiotics prevent early rebleeding after
acute variceal haemorrhage

translocation and endotoxaemia and thus to impairment of liver
function and increase in portal pressure, possibly causing further
damage to the gut: a vicious circle.

setting of portal vein thrombosis in non-cirrhotic patients,
where often there are oesophageal varices of the largest size
with red signs, the incidence of bleeding is much lower than
in cirrhotics with similar varices. Thus the bleeding rate in
portal vein thrombosis has been documented as 12.5 episodes
per 100 patient years85 whereas the risk of first bleeding with
Child grade A cirrhotics with large varices and moderate red
signs is 24% in one year and in Child grade C with small
varices and no red signs, 20%.84 The difference probably lies in
the presence of liver disease (although the thrombophilic
conditions often associated with portal vein thrombosis
cannot be discounted). Cirrhosis predisposes to risk of
infection which is not reported in non-cirrhotic portal
hypertension.
This increased release of endotoxin and viable bacteria into
the portal and systemic circulation is closely related to liver
cirrhosis, with portal hypertension and liver dysfunction
influencing increased intestinal permeability and altered
small bowel motility on the one hand and bacterial over￾growth on the other (fig 1). Low grade endotoxaemia leads to
priming of monomacrophages and an increase in NO and
TNF-a. Bacterial translocation causes a further increase in
NO and TNF-a, a reduced response to vasoconstrictors, and
an increased risk of bacterial infection, with the associated
risk of variceal bleeding, renal failure, hepatocellular injury,
hepatic encephalopathy, and mortality (fig 2).
The possible causative role of bacterial infection in variceal
haemorrhage is less easily understood but nevertheless is
most intriguing.23 Indeed, the known risk factors for variceal
bleeding (HVPG, liver function, size of varices, and presence
of red signs) do not readily explain why bleeding and early
rebleeding occur unpredictably in patients with cirrhosis.
Portal pressure rises significantly with daily meals as well as
exercise, yet despite these marked daily changes, bleeding
episodes are relatively infrequent. Thus a merely mechanical
understanding of variceal bleeding as a consequence of portal
pressure and tension on the variceal wall does not in our view
explain the pattern of variceal bleeding. Endotoxaemia
secondary to bacterial infection may indeed be the critical
trigger for variceal haemorrhage23 as it produces a wide series
of effects that may predispose the cirrhotic patient to
bleeding: impairment of primary and secondary haemostasis,
increase in portal pressure, and worsening of liver function
(fig 3).
CONCLUSION
Understanding of the consequences of bacterial infection and
bacterial products in the portal and systemic haemodynamics
of cirrhosis and the extensive amount of clinical data on
infection gathered both from retrospective and prospective
studies, in variceal bleeding and other settings, have been
followed by recent clinical evidence of the efficacy of
antibiotic treatment in reversing systemic vasodilation8 52
and the prevention of early variceal rebleeding.5
We believe the evidence presented in this review justifies
randomised studies of prokinetics and probiotic therapy in
decompensated cirrhotics with infection, as well as in
preventative studies. In particular, a randomised trial should
be undertaken of long term antibiotics or selective gut
decontamination together with propranolol in the primary or
secondary prevention of variceal bleeding.
