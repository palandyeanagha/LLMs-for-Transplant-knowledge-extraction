Abstract
Abnormal polysomnographic (PSG) features, most notably increased
electromyographic (EMG) tone and eye movements during non-
REM sleep have been observed during sleep in fluoxetine-treated
depressed patients. However, the relationship between these PSG
features and sleep disruption is unclear. Nine depressed patients
treated with 10 to 80 mg of fluoxetine and six unmedicated,
depressed patients were studied polysomnographically on two
consecutive nights during which sleep parameters, transient
arousals, and eye movements were measured. The fluoxetine group
experienced a lower-average sleep efficiency index (SEI) and
significantly more eye movements and arousals during non-REM
sleep than the control group. Eye movement and arousal counts
were significantly correlated. In addition, clinically significant
periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD) was observed in 44% of
the fluoxetine-treated group versus none of the control group. We
conclude that a higher incidence of PLMD and frequent transient
arousals associated with eye movements may be responsible in part


for the complaint of insomnia made by patients treated with
fluoxetine.
