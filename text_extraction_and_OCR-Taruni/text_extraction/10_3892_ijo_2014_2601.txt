Abstract. The PI3K/Akt pathway is an actively pursued thera￾peutic target in oncology. In prostate cancer, the activation of 
this pathway appears to be characteristic of many aggressive 
prostate cancers. Further, activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway is 
more frequently observed as prostate cancer progresses toward 
a resistant, metastatic disease. Signalling from this pathway 
activates numerous survival, growth, metabolic and metastatic 
functions characteristic of aggressive cancer. Biomarkers of this 
pathway have correlated activation of this pathway to high grade 
disease and higher risk of disease progression. Therefore there 
is significant interest in developing effective strategies to target 
this pathway in prostate cancer. In this review, we discuss the 
pre-clinical and clinical data relevant to targeting of the PI3K/
Akt pathway in prostate cancer. In particular, we review the 
rationale and relevance of co-targeting approaches against the 
PI3K/Akt pathway. It is anticipated that through an improved 
understanding of the biology of the PI3K/Akt pathway in 
prostate cancer, relevant biomarkers and rationale combination 
therapies will optimize targeting of this pathway to improve 
outcomes among patients with aggressive prostate cancer.

1. Introduction
Prostate cancer is the second most frequent cause of cancer 
death in American men, with approximately 1 in 36 men dying 
of prostate cancer (1). Over the last several years, new therapies 
have emerged for treatment of castrate resistant prostate cancer 
(CRPC) which have improved the survival of patients with 
this disease (2,3). Nonetheless, cure remains elusive with resis￾tance developing over time. With the increasing use of potent 
anti-androgens such as abiraterone and enzalutamide, there 
is renewed interest in targeting non-AR pathways in prostate 
cancer progression.
One of the most prominent alternate pathways in prostate 
cancer is the PI3K/Akt signalling pathway. Activation of this 
pathway is implicated in many aggressive human cancers (4). 
Accordingly, there has been significant investment toward 
developing targeted inhibitors of this pathway in various 
hematologic and solid cancers. In this review, we will discuss 
the relevance of the PI3K/Akt pathway in prostate cancer, 
highlighting both basic science and clinical aspects.
2. PI3K/Akt signalling pathway
The PI3K/Akt signalling pathway regulates cellular metabo￾lism, tumour development, growth, proliferation, metastases 
and cytoskeletal reorganization. It is part of a complex 
intracellular cell signalling cascade (Fig. 1). PI3K is a plasma 
membrane-associated protein kinase consisting of three 
subunits: the regulatory subunits p85 and p55; referred by 
convention as collectively p85 and a catalytic subunit, p110 (5). 
There are three classes; it is the class IA PI3Ks which are the 
most clearly implicated in human cancer, including prostate 
cancer. Moreover, this class is usually downstream of receptor 
tyrosine kinases. Activation of receptor tyrosine kinases at 
the cell membrane results in conformational changes which 
removes auto-inhibition of the catalytic domain of PI3K. Three 
catalytic isoforms p110α, p110β and p110δ are, respectively, 
the product of the genes PIK3CA, PIK3CB and PIK3CD. 
Once activated, PI3K catalyzes the phosphorylation of PIP2 
to produce PIP3. PIP3 then activates intracellular signalling 
through its binding to pleckstrin homology (PH) domains of 
many signalling proteins, including Akt. In prostate cancer, 
it appears that the p110β isoform is most relevant to prostate

1794 Toren and Zoubeidi: The PI3K/Akt pathway in prostate cancer
cancer progression and resistance (6). It has been associated 
with basal activation of Akt in prostate cancer models (7).
The PI3K/Akt pathway functions downstream of receptor 
tyrosine kinases (RTKs) as well as independently of RTKs. 
Non-RTK activation of this pathway may be from other intra￾cellular signalling pathways or from other membrane receptors 
including G-protein coupled receptors. The main upstream 
activators likely are context specific. In autopsy specimens of 
metastatic prostate lesions, various RTKs were associated with 
Akt activation (8). Of note, many of the RTKs which activated 
the PI3K/Akt pathway, including EGFR, IGF-IR, FGFR and 
c-MET receptors, are actively researched as targets in CRPC. 
Nonetheless, some in vitro studies in prostate cancer cells 
suggests that basal activation of this pathway occurs indepen￾dently of RTKs (7). Notably, phospho-proteomic analysis of 
metastatic tumour samples collected on rapid autopsy found 
that Akt was the tyrosine kinase most commonly found to be 
active in metastastic prostate cancer (8). Activated Akt is a 
kinase which in turn phosphorylates and activates many onco￾genic features within cancer cells. Upon recruitment to the cell 
membrane, it is phosphorylated by phosphoinositide-dependent 
kinase 1 (PDK1), a reaction catalyzed by PIP3 binding to the 
PH domains of both molecules (Fig. 1). Once phosphorylated 
at both Ser473 and Thr308 phosphosites, the activated Akt can 
activate many downstream functions via its kinase activity.
Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a major down￾stream signalling protein involved in protein translation via the 
eIF4E complex and S6K which is activated by Akt. Both mTOR 
and S6K are found in higher levels in prostate cancer compared 
to benign controls (9). The proteins differentially associated with 
mTOR defined the TORC1 andTORC2 complexes. These have 
overlapping, but different functions, with TORC2 providing 
negative feedback regulation on the PI3K/Akt pathway via S6K 
(10,11). There are many other downstream oncogenic effects of 
Akt phosphorylation. Cell survival is promoted through anti￾apoptotic effects, particularly inhibition of the pro-apoptotic 
Bcl-2 family members BAD and BAX (12). Transcription 
factor FOX01 acts as a tumour suppressor and its phosphory￾lation by Akt induces its ubiquitation and degradation by the 
proteasome. Further, inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase 3 
(GSK-3) increases cellular translation of proteins as does phos￾phorylation of 4eBP-1. Regulation of cell growth and survival 
by Akt also occurs by the NF-κB pathway via activation of 
IκB kinase (IKK) (Fig. 1). Further, the PI3k/Akt pathway in 
prostate cancer appears to be involved with modulation of 
DNA damage repair pathway (13). More recently, the PI3K/Akt 
pathway has been implicated in modulating a more aggressive 
phenotype through modulation of cholesterol ester formation 
in prostate cancer cells (14). This suggests a possible relation￾ship with metabolic pathway disturbances and the development 
of aggressive prostate cancer. Overall, there are a plethora of 
downstream cellular functions of the Akt pathway which corre￾spond to a clinically aggressive phenotype.
3. Regulation by phosphatases
The PI3K/Akt pathway is antagonized by several phosphatases, 
including phosphatase and tensin homolog gene (PTEN), PH 
and leucine-rich repeat protein phosphatase (PHLPP), cellular 
prostatic acid phosphatase, PP2A and INPP4B (15-17) (Table I). 
Genetic loss or other inactivation of these phosphatases results 
in greater amounts of phospho-Akt and subsequent increased 
or sustained oncogenic signaling. Notably, the PTEN gene on 
chromosome 10q23.3 is the most-commonly deleted gene in 
prostate cancer (18). However, genomic loss of PTEN does not 
always correlate with activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway (19). 
Pre-clinical models and patient samples also show that loss 
of PTEN results in a particularly aggressive phenotype when 
found in combination with activation of receptor tyrosine 
kinases (20,21). PHLPP is regulated by the AR via FKBP5 and 
explains in part the upregulation of the PI3K/Akt pathway seen 
following androgen deprivation (17). INPP4B is decreased 
following androgen deprivation and may be another mecha￾nism through which the Akt pathway is activated resulting in 
earlier disease recurrence (16).
4. Role of PI3K/Akt in prostate carcinogenesis and 
progression
The mechanisms through which the PI3K pathway may induce 
carcinogenesis include the activation of growth and survival 
pathways. Further, activation of this pathway may also alter 
epigenetic regulators, such as BIM1 (22). The PI3K/Akt 
pathway has also been shown to be important to the survival 
and proliferation of prostate cancer stem cells (23).
PTEN deletion is commonly used to model prostate cancer 
progression in mice (24,25). PTEN loss in mice has been 
shown to suppress androgen-responsive genes and promote cell 
autonomous growth (26). Activation of the P3K/Akt pathway 
in mice may also occur using myristolated Akt or constitutive 
activation of p110β. In a murine subrenal xenograft model, 
activation of both AR and Akt has been noted to synergize to 
increase prostate tumour growth (27). Nonetheless, the exact 
role of this pathway in carcinogenesis in humans is uncertain. 
On the contrary, a recent genome wide sequencing analysis 
suggests that PTEN loss is a late-stage feature in the progres￾sion of prostate cancer (28).
Pre-clinical studies suggest that concomitant loss of certain 
proteins together with PTEN loss appear to accelerate prostate 
cancer progression. This has been demonstrated in mice and 
correlated with features of aggressiveness, such as Gleason score, 
in patient samples for the tumour suppressors NKX3.1, EAF2/

U19, Gata3 and Sox9 (29-33). B-raf and Stat3 activation and loss 
of SMAD4 and p53 signalling have also been shown in murine 
models to cooperate with PTEN loss to enhance prostate cancer 
progression (34-37). This complex network with other pathways 
highlights why monotherapy against the PI3K/Akt pathway may 
not be an optimal strategy. Table II lists different combination 
strategies which have been explored targeting the PI3K/Akt/
mTOR pathway in pre-clinical models of prostate cancer.
5. PI3K/Akt and the AR pathway
The relationship between the PI3K/Akt and AR pathways is of 
significant interest as a co-targeting strategy in prostate cancer 
(17,38). Reciprocal interactions between these pathways have 
been demonstrated in several pre-clinical studies (17,39,40). 
Blockade of the AR pathway results in PHLPP-mediated Akt 
inactivation via a decrease in androgen regulated FKBP5 
(17,26). Inhibition of the PI3K/Akt pathway may result in 
upregulation of AR transcriptional activity via activation of 
membrane signalling proteins such as HER3 (Fig. 2) (17,41). 
Direct AR phosphorylation by Akt appears to predominantly 
be relevant in the low-testosterone state (i.e., during androgen 
deprivation) (27,42,43). Akt has been shown to phosphorylate 
the AR at Ser-213 and Ser-791, but the significance of these 
phosphosites is unclear (27). In vitro models suggest that Akt 
may regulate AR transcription (27), but that this is not by 
direct phosphorylation of the AR (27,44).
The combination of bicalutamide and a pan-Akt inhibitor, 
AZD5363 have been noted in vitro and in vivo in LNCaP 
models to synergize to decreased tumour growth (38). Early 
results suggest markedly decreased in vivo tumour volumes 
with the use of potent pan-Akt or PI3K isoform specific 
inhibitors in combination with potent AR inhibitors (45,46). 
These pre-clinical findings have supported the development of 
clinical trials of combination blockade of both the AR and the 
PI3k/Akt/mTOR pathways (Table III). Further understanding 
of the interactions between these pathways in pre-clinical 
models may aid in design of future clinical trials.
6. PI3K/Akt pathway as a biomarker in prostate cancer
With the aggressive oncogenic characteristics of the PI3K/Akt 
pathway, there has been significant interest to use this pathway 
as a biomarker to differentiate more significant, lethal prostate 
cancer from more indolent disease. While it does appear from 
the current data that this pathway does provide prognostic infor￾mation, it is unclear that it provides any significant improvement 
over currently used clinical and pathologic markers. However, 
there is ongoing interest to use this pathway as a predictive 
biomarker for newer targeted agents of this pathway.
The challenges of using this pathway as a biomarker relate 
in large part to the complexity of the biology in advanced pros￾tate cancer and tumour heterogeneity. Firstly, there is a large 
diversity of mutations and genomic alterations which may

activate this pathway, making any single marker less sensitive. 
Further, the context of this pathway in prostate cancer differs 
from other malignancies where this pathway also plays an 
important role. For example, while activating PI3KCA muta￾tions are relatively common among advanced malignancies, 
it does not appear to be as common in prostate cancer (47). 
Factors in the tumour microenvironment can influence signal￾ling of this pathway, which is downstream of various cell 
surface receptors. Therefore, both tumour and patient heteroge￾neity contribute to a complexity making biomarker evaluation 
and validation more challenging. For example, in circulating 
tumour cells PTEN allelic loss has significant heterogeneity 
when analyzed by fluorescent in situ hybridization (48). 
Further, on immunohistochemistry, analysis of downstream 
targets does not clearly correlate in patient samples with the 
phosphorylation of Akt. In one study, phosphorylation of 
downstream GSK3β and a forkhead transcription factor was 
noted in only 29 and 40% of cases, respectively, in localized 
prostate cancer samples with phospho-Akt (49). Finally, tech￾nical variation, antibody limitations, tissue acquisition and 
processing also present challenges to use of this pathway as a 
clinical biomarker.

1798 Toren and Zoubeidi: The PI3K/Akt pathway in prostate cancer
It is estimated that genomic PTEN alterations are found 
in 9-45% of high grade prostate intra-epithelial neoplasia 
(HG-PIN), increase to 20-60% in localized prostate cancer, 
and are altered in up to 100% of cases of metastatic prostate 
cancer (47,50). Homozygous deletion of PTEN is linked 
with CRPC (51). Further, PTEN is the most common gene 
with loss of heterozygosity in circulating tumour cells CTCs 
(52). Similarly, mutations in the PI3K pathway occur more 
frequently in metastatic tissue compared to primary tumours. 
In the Taylor et al dataset, mutations in the PI3K regulatory 
genes PIK3R1, PIK3R3 and PIK3CS occur at a frequency of 
22, 2 and 6% in primary tumours, respectively. In metastatic 
tissues, the frequency increases to 58, 16 and 16%, respectively 
(47). Mutations in PIK3CA catalytic gene of PI3K are known 
to be activating to the pathway and also may predict response 
to therapy with PI3K inhibitors, though they are not highly 
prevalent in prostate cancer (53). Mutations in the regulatory 
phosphatase PHLPP gene can also result in activation of the 
Akt pathway, occurring at 11 and 37% in primary and meta￾static tumours, respectively (47).
On immunohistochemistry, both PTEN status and phospho￾Akt are the most commonly investigated biomarkers. Akt can be 
phosphorylated at Thr308 and Ser473; it appears that both sites 
are usually phosphorylated in the active state. It does appear that 
Akt staining is specific to tumour cells, without any staining in 
adjacent stromal tissue (49). Not surprisingly given the mole￾cular features of the activated PI3K/Akt pathway, the loss of 
PTEN staining in localized prostate cancer samples correlates 
with higher Gleason score and pathologic stage (54,55) as well 
as an increased risk of positive lymph nodes (56). PTEN protein 
loss on immunohistochemistry of the primary tumour has also 
been associated with shorter time to biochemical recurrence 
post radical prostatectomy, but not consistently (57). Levels of 
phospho-Akt increase with higher Gleason grade (58,59) and 
are associated with poorer survival in CRPC (60). However, it 
is unclear whether they hold any prognostic significance in low 
and intermediate grade disease (Gleason score 6-7) (59). Levels 
of phospho-Akt also predict for biochemical recurrence post 
radical prostatectomy, with improved prediction when used in 
combination with PTEN protein loss (61). Loss of INPP4B has 
been noted to be a good marker of aggressive breast cancer (62), 
but has not been explored in prostate cancer. Another area which 
remains to be more fully explored is the cellular localization of 
phospho-Akt. It is unclear whether increased nuclear staining 
improves prognostication, as suggested by one study which 
found that greater nuclear phospho-Akt staining was associated 
with higher Gleason grade (63).
In addition to the above mentioned studies on the use of 
PTEN, phospho-Akt or other related proteins as prognostic 
biomarkers, there is significant interest into the use of predic￾tive biomarkers for PI3K/Akt targeting agents. Only a few 
studies to date have investigated predictive biomakers, but this 
area is expected to increase as more inhibitors of this pathway 
enter clinical evaluation. In unselected men with CRPC, PTEN 
status on immunohistochemistry did not predict response to 
everolimus (64). Activating mutations in mTOR were found 
in one patient with an excellent response to combination 
everolimus and pazopanib (65). Similar anecdotal responses 
to AZD5363, a pan-Akt inhibitor has been reported to be asso￾ciated with genetic alterations, but not yet in prostate cancer 
patients (66). Prospected clinical investigation and validation 
is ongoing to identify and evaluate appropriate predictive 
biomarkers in patients for response to PI3K/Akt inhibitor 
therapy in prostate cancer patients.
7. Clinical studies of PI3K/Akt/mTOR inhibitors in prostate 
cancer
Several novel PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway inhibitors are in clin￾ical development (Table III) for advanced prostate cancer. Two 
studies have evaluated monotherapy with the Akt inhibitor 
perifosine in prostate cancer. Perifosine is an alkylphospholid 
with Akt inhibitor properties. Akylphospholipids are known 
to accumulate in cell membranes, but the exact reason for the 
anticancer activity is unclear, but this is presumed due to its 
capacity to inhibit the Akt pathway. A phase II trial of perifo￾sine monotherapy in 25 patients with biochemical recurrence 
after primary therapy did not alter PSA doubling time and 
was ended early for lack of response (67). No significant 
toxicities were reported in this relatively healthy population. 
A second trial in 19 patients with metastatic prostate cancer 
also demonstrated minimal benefit (68). The median time to 
progression was 4 weeks, with only 4 patients having stable 
disease beyond 12 weeks. A recent phase III trial with perifo￾sine in colon cancer has also found no therapeutic benefit (69).
The novel agents now in development (Table III) differ 
significantly from perifosine's mechanism of action and 
limited side effects. Most are small molecule reversible inhibi￾tors of the catalytic function of PI3K, Akt, and/or mTOR. 
The common adverse effects of PI3k/Akt inhibitors reported 
to date include insulin resistance, hyperglycemia, nausea and 
mood alterations. PI3K inhibitors include non-specific and 
isoform-specific inhibitors. The three isoforms (p110α, β, 
and δ) of class IA PI3K may play relatively different roles in 
the progression of prostate cancer (7). Isoform-specific inhibi￾tors in prostate cancer aim to inhibit only the PI3Kβ and δ
isoforms to decrease insulin resistance and hyperglycemia 
associated with PI3Kα inhibition (70).
BKM120 is an oral pan-PI3K inhibitor with reported 
clinical data in advanced solid tumours, including prostate 
cancer (71). Among 31 patients in the phase I trial, one had a 
partial response and 12 (52%) had stable disease. Treatment￾related adverse events include rash, hyperglycemia, diarrhea, 
anorexia, mood alteration, nausea and fatigue. Reversible neuro￾psychiatric adverse events may be due to BKM120 crossing the 
blood-brain barrier and inhibiting PI3K/Akt/mTOR signalling 
modulating neurotransmitter concentrations. Similarly, results 
with the oral pan-Akt inhibitor AZD5363 showed two partial 
responses out of 92 patients in two phase I trials (66). Notably, 
both patients had mutations in Akt1 or PI3KCA, suggesting 
mutations in these genes may be predictive of response.
Results to date with inhibition of downstream TORC1 or 
TORC2 in prostate cancer have been disappointing. Rapalogs 
such as everolimus, temsirolimus, and ridaforolimus have 
had poor results as single agents in prostate cancer clinical 
trials (64,72). This may be due in part to TORC2 mediated 
feedback on Akt (10). Dual TORC1/TORC2 inhibition has 
demonstrated improved inhibition of downstream effectors 
such as the eIF-4E protein translation complex not seen with 
mTORC1 inhibition (73). Dual mTORC1/mTORC2 inhibi-

tors have entered clinical testing for advanced solid tumours, 
including prostate cancer (74).
8. Combination targeting in prostate cancer
From pre-clinical data to date, as well as the failure of prior 
monotherapy trials, it appears that targeting of the PI3K/Akt 
pathway in prostate cancer is optimally done in combination 
with other agents. While monotherapy with newer agents may 
have some activity, the abundance of cross-talk with other 
pathways seen in pre-clinical studies suggests that resistance 
will develop as other pathways are reciprocally upregulated. 
In breast cancer, the combination of the aromatase inhibitor 
targeting the estrogen receptor with everolimus targeting 
mTOR demonstrated significant synergy (75). In an analogous 
manner in prostate cancer, rationale combination therapy may 
significantly improve clinical response rates and reduce the 
development of resistance.
Combination therapy with PI3K/Akt/mTOR inhibitors in 
prostate cancer can be conceptualized as vertical blockade, 
with inhibition of multiple nodes in the PI3K/Akt pathway or 
horizontal blockade, with inhibition of the PI3K/Akt pathway 
together with other parallel pathways. For example, pre-clinical 
work in transgenic mice suggests that dual targeting of the Akt 
and mTOR signalling (i.e., vertical blockade) has significantly 
more activity compared to either monotherapy (76). Dual PI3K/
mTOR blockade with one molecule is facilitated by similari￾ties of the PI3K and mTOR catalytic sites. Similarly, effective 
combinations of Akt or mTOR inhibition with AR blockade has 
been noted in other pre-clinical studies (17,38,77). Combination 
of Akt inhibition with receptor tyrosine kinases is another hori￾zontal blockade strategy with good pre-clinical data (10).
Many of the ongoing clinical trials are evaluating a 
PI3K/Akt inhibitor in combination with an AR pathway inhibitor 
(Table III). A limited number of trials targeting both pathways 
have been reported in prostate cancer. A study in 36 patients 
with CRPC of the mTOR inhibitor everolimus in combination 
with bicalutamide has been reported (78). This study did not 
show any benefit for the combination, though it was well toler￾ated. Reasons for the lack of benefit could include a possible 
partial agonist effect of bicalutamide, lack of effective AR inhi￾bition with bicalutamide as well as the activation of upstream 
Akt as a result of mTOR inhibition. However, another phase I/
II trial found that of 13 patients treated with bicalutamide and 
everolimus, 9 had a partial response, one an unconfirmed partial 
response and 3 had stable disease. Of the 5 patients treated with 
placebo + bicalutamide, 1 had partial response, one unconfirmed 
partial response, 2 stable disease and 1 had disease progression. 
The mean time to relapse was 220 days for the everolimus + 
bicalutamide vs 109 days for placebo + bicalutamide (79). Very 
early results of the combination of BKM120 with abiraterone 
and prednisone are also promising (80).
One putative benefit of combination therapy is decreased 
toxicity while maintaining therapeutic efficacy. However, this 
has yet to be consistently observed in clinical trials in patients. 
Increased toxicity has been noted in some early studies to date 
when using combination therapy (81,82). In a clinical trial of 
11 patients with CRPC treated with ridaforolimus and bicalu￾tamide, 3 had dose-limiting toxicity, including hyperglycemia 
and stomatitis. It is anticipated that continued experience 
with these newer PI3K inhibitors will result in better dosing 
schedules to minimize adverse effects, while maintaining 
therapeutic efficacy.
9. Conclusion
Activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway clearly plays a major role 
in the aggressive nature of many prostate cancers. With the use 
of newer AR pathway inhibitors and combination therapy, this 
non-androgen receptor pathway may become increasingly rele￾vant as more patients develop non-AR driven tumours. Clinical 
trials are now assessing the efficacy of targeting this pathway in 
CRPC. An improved understanding of the biology and relevant 
biomarkers of this pathway in prostate cancer will be impor￾tant to understand which patients will benefit from PI3K/Akt/
mTOR inhibitors and at what point in the disease course they 
should be given. The use of combination therapy has potential 
to substantially improve the outcome of patients, but needs 
to be balanced against toxicities, particularly if combination 
therapies are utilized earlier in the course of disease.
