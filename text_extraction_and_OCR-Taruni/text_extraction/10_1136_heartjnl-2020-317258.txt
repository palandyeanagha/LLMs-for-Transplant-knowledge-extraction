Abstract
Adults with congenital heart disease (ACHD) may 
be at high risk in the case of COVID-19. Due to the 
heterogeneity of ACHD and secondary complications, 
risk profiles are, however, not uniform. This document 
aims to give an overview of relevant data and outline 
our pragmatic approach to disease prevention and 
management. Based on anatomy and additional 
physiological factors including symptoms, exercise 
capacity, heart failure, pulmonary hypertension 
and cyanosis, we propose a pragmatic approach to 
categorising patients into low-risk, intermediate-risk 
and high-risk groups. We regard especially patients 
with complex cyanotic conditions, those with palliated 
univentricular hearts, heart failure, severe valvular 
disease or pulmonary hypertension as high-risk patients. 
To avoid infection, we recommend self-isolation and 
exemption from work for these cohorts. Infected ACHD 
patients with low or moderate risk and without signs 
of deterioration may be remotely followed and cared 
for at home while in self isolation. High-risk patients 
or those with signs of respiratory or cardiovascular 
impairment require admission ideally at a tertiary 
ACHD centre. Especially patients with complex, cyanotic 
disease, heart failure and arrhythmias require particular 
attention. Treatment in patients with cyanotic heart 
disease should be guided by the relative degree of 
desaturation compared with baseline and lactate levels 
rather than absolute oxygen saturation levels. Patients 
with right heart dilatation or dysfunction are potentially 
at increased risk of right heart failure as mechanical 
ventilation and acute respiratory distress syndrome can 
lead to increase in pulmonary arterial pressures.
Introduction
Since December 2019, the severe acute respira￾tory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has 
spread globally leading to millions of infections 
and over 300000 deaths.1
 Healthcare systems have 
been struggling to adequately address the needs of 
infected patients. Shortages of hospital capacity, 
manpower and supplies are reported even from 
highly developed countries. Many tertiary cardiac 
centres and specialised cardiologists had to shift 
focus of care, postponing or rerouting specialised 
cardiac procedures to provide adequate resources 
for general COVID-19 patients. While this may 
have ample indirect implications for the regular 
care of adults with congenital heart disease (ACHD) 
due to postponement of diagnostic and therapeutic 
procedures, the focus of the current review is on 
the direct impact of SARS-CoV-2 on congenital 
patients. Beyond its primary impact on the respi￾ratory system, it has been highlighted that the virus 
also affects the cardiovascular system and coagu￾lation. Furthermore, pre-existent cardiovascular 
conditions represent important risk factors for 
morbidity and mortality. As a consequence, ACHD 
patients are particularly concerned with preventive 
measures and optimal care in the case of COVID￾19. Despite of numerous recently published articles 
on the topic, our understanding of the virus and the 
disease is incomplete, and robust data specifically in 
the setting of congenital heart disease are lacking. 
This document aims to give a selective overview of 
data relevant to the field of ACHD and to outline 
our current approach to disease prevention and 
management of ACHD patients. Specifically, we 
comment on our recommendations regarding work 
and educational duties versus shielding patients at 
home, balancing patients’ economic and psycho￾social needs versus the perceived risk of adverse 
outcome in case of contracting COVID-19. A high￾level overview over respiratory issues and inten￾sive care therapy is also provided for the benefit of 
cardiologists involved in the multidisciplinary care 
of severely affected patients.
Virus characteristics
SARS-CoV-2 is a large enveloped betacorona-virus 
targeting primarily the respiratory system but also 
affecting multiple other organs. Using its spike 
surface glycoproteins, SARS-CoV-2 binds to the 
cellular ACE-2 receptor and, facilitated by a specific 
cellular protease, is internalised into target cells. 
Beyond airway epithelial cells, ACE-2 is expressed 
in multiple organs, including vascular endothelial 
cells, immune cell tissue, the heart and the intes￾tine.2
 SARS-CoV-2 has a distinct impact on the 
immune system including early lymphopaenia and 
a postviral cytokine storm response also reported 
as part of severe influenza infections.3 4 It repli￾cates quickly in the upper airways, generating high 
virus concentrations, thus facilitating transmission 
during normal social contact. It has been estimated 
that one active SARS-CoV-2 case can infect approx￾imately 2–3 other individuals, compared with ≈1.3 
for influenza.5
 Unfortunately, symptoms often 
appear only days after patients become infective 
thus promoting virus transmission.
Respiratory presentation, disease stages
and general management
Some virus carriers remain asymptomatic. In those 
developing COVID-19, the incubation period is 
approximately 4–5 days after which patients begin 
to experience non-specific symptoms, including 
fever, dry cough, sore throat, rhinorrhoea, head￾aches, myalgia and occasionally diarrhoea. It has 
been reported that many patients experience loss of 
smell and taste.6

flu-like symptoms, occasionally associated with fever, has been 
labelled stage 1 disease (early infection, figure 1).7
 In retrospec￾tive studies, up to 80% of cases have been reported to only expe￾rience this form of disease with a time to recovery of about 2 
weeks.8
 Patients with suspected disease should obtain confirma￾tion of SARS-CoV-2 infection via nasopharyngeal swab. If diag￾nosis is confirmed, patients are advised to self-isolate and use oral 
antipyretics/analgesics per requirement, while contact individ￾uals can be traced and tested to stop further virus transmission.
More severe stages of the disease (stage 2a, ‘Pulmonary 
phase’) are characterised clinically by onset of dyspnoea. At 
this point, hospitalisation is advised as patients may deteriorate 
rapidly. Chest X-ray usually shows bilateral atypical pneumonia. 
On lung CT, consolidations and bilateral ground glass opacities 
typically present basal and peripheral (figure 2A). CT imaging 
may be used as a screening tool, as sensitivity of reverse tran￾scriptase PCR testing is limited.9
 Laboratory testing at this stage 
may show lymphopaenia, mildly increased C reactive protein 
(CRP) and procalcitonin (PCT), which are regarded as adverse 
prognostic signs.10 In addition to analgesia and antipyretic medi￾cations, oxygen supplied by nasal canula or non-rebreathing 
mask is often required. Routine antibiotic therapy is not gener￾ally advised as secondary bacterial infection rarely occurs. Anec￾dotal evidence and expert opinion suggest that some patients 
may benefit from spending prolonged periods of time in a prone 
position. This severe form of disease is experienced by around 
14% of COVID-19 cases, with approximately 5% progressing 
to require critical care.8
 Overt hypoxia (peripheral oxygen 
saturation <93% despite supplemental oxygen, stage 2b) and 
tachypnoea (>30/min) are markers of severe disease and should 
trigger respiratory support. Whether non-invasive ventilation 
(NIV) should be used is a matter of debate regarding indication 
and possible increase of aerosol formation increasing infection 
risk for healthcare professionals. Mechanical ventilation strategy 
(eg, NIV vs intubation) is also depending on available resources.
In contrast to classic forms of acute respiratory distress 
syndrome (ARDS), lung compliance is often preserved initially, 
and patients may not perceive pronounced dyspnoea despite low

oxygen saturations. Hypoxia is caused by ventilation/perfusion 
mismatch due to impaired hypoxic vasoconstriction.11 Mechan￾ical ventilation should be attempted with low tidal volumes, and 
at this point, recruitment by high positive end-expiratory pres￾sure (PEEP) values is not deemed beneficial. Later stages ARDS, 
however, can resemble classic ARDS forms with decreased 
compliance, intrapulmonary right-to-left-shunting and a higher 
portion of recruitable lung tissue potentially benefiting from 
PEEP ventilation. If invasive ventilation is not sufficient for 
adequate oxygen uptake and CO2
 release, an extracorporeal 
lung replacement procedure may be considered.12
Patients in stage 2a and 2b may be haemodynamically stable 
but often require prolonged periods of ventilation. Even after 
a phase of relative clinical stability some patients deteriorate 
into stage 3, characterised by ARDS and at times haemodynamic 
instability. In ARDS, shock and multiorgan failure are the major 
contributors to fatal outcomes. Laboratory testing shows further 
increase in CRP, PCT, interleukin-6, D-dimers and ferritin 
as humoural immune response is insufficient to inactivate 
SARS-CoV-2 resulting in a hyperinflammatory cytokine storm.11
Currently, there are no approved specific medical treatments for 
COVID-19. Several drugs are being tested in clinical trials and 
are summarised in the online supplementary.
General cardiac involvement
A minority of patients present with chest pain as initial 
symptom.13 Myocardial injury with ECG changes and elevated 
levels of troponin, creatine kinase (CK), creatine kinase-MB 
(CK-MB) and N‐terminal fragment of brain natriuretic peptide 
(NT-Pro-BNP) has been observed. In this case, the standard 
protocol for acute coronary syndromes including coronary 
angiography should be followed. In critically ill patients with 
COVID-19, the likelihood of primary coronary occlusions is 
lower and other forms of myocardial injury have to be consid￾ered. During later stage 3 disease a steep rise of troponin is 
associated with worse outcome.10 Severely reduced ventric￾ular function and acute heart failure are not uncommon in this 
setting and frequently represent the presumed cause of death.14
Viral myocarditis, hypoxia or myocardial ischaemia due to 
pre-existing coronary disease, mismatch of coronary flow and 
increased demand, stress cardiomyopathy or systemic hyperin￾flammation may play a role.15 16 Right ventricular failure due to 
increased pulmonary capillary resistance and mechanical ventila￾tion may represent a complication of ARDS.17 18
Arrhythmia has been described in a substantial number of 
critically ill patients with COVID-19, including cases of sudden 
cardiac death.19 20 The risk may be increased by myocarditis, 
ventricular dysfunction, electrolyte imbalances, fever as well 
endogenous or exogenous inotropes. Finally, the potential 
proarrhythmogenic effects of antiviral therapy have to be consid￾ered.21 Recent reports highlight the occurrence of venous and 
arterial thrombosis possibly related to immobilisation, hypoxia, 
hyperinflammation and diffuse intravascular coagulation.22–24
Specific aspects of ACHD
Adults with congenital heart disease frequently present with 
other relevant comorbidities but represent on average a younger 
cohort than the general heart disease population. They may 
be afflicted by residual valvular or shunt lesions, ventricular 
dysfunction, heart failure, arrhythmias, pulmonary vascular 
disease, cyanosis, renal or hepatic dysfunction as well as propen￾sity for infections and neurological sequelae.25 Currently, there 
are no solid data with regards to COVID-19 related morbidity 
and mortality in ACHD patients. While international efforts 
to collect prospective data are on the way,26 risk assessment is 
currently largely performed on the basis of general risk factors 
and ACHD-specific anatomical and physiological consider￾ations.27 In the general population, the occurrence of severe 
COVID-19 and death are strongly linked to advanced patient 
age. Since most ACHD patients are markedly younger,28 this 
would suggest a lower risk for this patient group. However, it 
has to be considered that the majority of non-congenital patients 
with COVID-19 who died had one or more (mainly cardiovas￾cular) comorbidities.19 Therefore, it would be reasonable to 
expect pre-existing cardiac involvement to be a major risk factor 
for worse prognosis. Figure 3 illustrates the contradictory data 
with regard to ACHD risk stratification.
At present, the number ACHD patients affected by COVID-19 
is unknown. Combining available real-time epidemiological data 
of confirmed patients with COVID-191
 with current estimates 
of CHD prevalence suggests that approximately 4800 ACHD 
patients are currently actively infected in Europe and about 5600 
patients in the USA and Canada as of 22 May 2020 (figure 4). 
These numbers assume a prevalence of 6.12/1000 adult popula￾tion (6.16 for the USA)28 29 and that ACHD patients are infected 
at a comparable rate as the general population and require 
confirmation by prospective data.
Preventive measures
We advise patients to adhere to local regulations, practice phys￾ical distancing, meticulous hygiene and to wear face masks 
to reduce viral spread depending on the situation. Further 
recommendations are based on the underlying cardiac defect 
and associated complications. We are guided in risk stratifica￾tion by the anatomic complexity of the cardiac lesion but also 
consider physiological aspects modulating the risk of adverse 
outcome. For example, patients with severely reduced systolic 
ventricular function would be considered high-risk individuals 
irrespective of underlying heart defect, whereas some patients 
with more complex lesions such as repaired tetralogy of Fallot 
or transposition of the great arteries after arterial switch oper￾ation with pristine haemodynamics are classified as lower risk 
patients. For practical reasons, we categorise patients into a 
low-risk, intermediate-risk and high-risk group. Patients in the 
low-risk category would not be advised against work duties 
they usually perform, including in the healthcare setting. For 
patients at moderate risk, we would advise to reduce physical 
contact with customers and colleagues and recommend against 
healthcare-related occupations with direct care for patients with 
COVID-19 or those involving children who are unable to adhere 
to infection limiting measures. For high-risk patients, we would 
recommend self-isolation at home and exemption from work on 
an individual basis (figure 5). We emphasise that this approach 
requires individual assessment and should also include consid￾eration of general high-risk features such as age and acquired 
cardiovascular conditions. Furthermore, this approach requires 
adjustment for consistence with current local recommendations 
and legislation.
Outpatient assessment and management
Due to local restrictions or reallocation of ACHD specialists to 
general care facilities, the volume of ACHD outpatient visits may 
have to be reduced to essential visits only. To avoid preventable 
complications due to cancelled diagnostic or therapeutic proce￾dures, senior ACHD specialist should review outpatient appoint￾ments and ensure that high-risk patients are prioritised. Patient

Review
Figure 3 Data from approximately 100 000 patients affected in Northern Italy illustrating that, in general, severe COVID-19 and death are linked 
to advanced patient age. Most ACHD patients are young28 in contrast, and this would suggest a lower risk. However, in this dataset the majority 
of non-congenital patients with COVID-19 who died had one or more (mainly cardiovascular) comorbidities. This suggests that pre-existing cardiac 
involvement (as seen in ACHD) is a major risk factor for adverse outcome (Dataset Minichini, Kaggle, based on Italian Civil Protection Department 
data, 21 April 2020). On balance, therefore, the net effect of these contradicting factors on ACHD outcome are currently unclear. ACHD, adult 
congenital heart disease; CHD, congenital heart disease.
scheduled for elective admission should be contacted in advance, 
screened for symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 and if required 
appropriate testing under necessary precautions should be 
arranged. Teleconsultations have also been shown to be feasible 
for selected non-congenital patients30 and should be used in the 
current setting where available for lower risk individuals. In the 
future, health tracking apps may complement the clinical picture 
but are currently difficult to interrogate directly by ACHD 
specialists and thus probably of limited immediate value.31
Infection with SARS-CoV-2 should be suspected in ACHD 
patients presenting with fever, onset or worsening of dyspnoea, 
lower than usual peripheral oxygen saturation but also in 
case of unexplained worsening of ventricular function or new 
arrhythmia. Rarely these patients may present with overt cardio￾genic shock.32 Comparison of current and previous oxygen satu￾rations, ECGs, complete blood cell counts, NT-Pro-BNP and 
troponin may be helpful. A chest X-ray or CT scan may provide 
additional information in selected patients. Echocardiography—
while an essential part of routine outpatient visits—should be 
focused on obtaining information of immediate clinical value 
such as pericardial effusion or ventricular function in the 
current situation avoiding prolonged direct physical contact 
with patients. Other infections should not be overlooked, and 
especially endocarditis remains prevalent in ACHD patients 
(figure 2B).33 Transoesophageal echocardiography is an essential 
part of endocarditis diagnosis; however, it is a highly aerosol 
generating procedure and should be restricted to selected cases 
under special precautions and, if possible, after SARS-CoV-2 
testing has been negative.34 Elective or semielective surgery may 
have to be postponed. Preoperative PCR testing and quarantine 
of positive patients is a strategy employed in many centres.
If ACHD patients are tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, 
management should be guided by patient risk and clinical 
status (figure 5). Parameters of oxygenation, blood pressure, 
heart rate and ECG should be recorded, and baseline labora￾tory testing performed. Point of care echocardiographic assess￾ment may be helpful in this situation. Stable patients with low 
or moderate risk and without signs or symptoms of respiratory 
or cardiovascular deterioration may be cared for at home with 
supportive measures, instructed to self-isolate and be remotely 
followed up through teleconsultation. Impairment of lung func￾tion is prevalent in ACHD patients and its severity is related 
to the complexity of the underlying heart defect, the surgical 
history and scoliosis.35 It has been shown to be an independent 
predictor of mortality in ACHD patients in general36 and should 
be expected to negatively influence disease course in COVID-19.

ACHD, adult congenital heart disease.
High-risk patients or those with signs of severe respiratory or 
cardiovascular impairment generally require hospital admission 
and in-hospital isolation.
Specific considerations for severely affected ACHD patients
A thorough understanding of the underlying anatomy and patho￾physiology is required when managing severely affected ACHD 
patients with complex underlying lesions, and they should be 
admitted to a secondary or tertiary ACHD centres. We advocate 
a multidisciplinary approach involving intensivists and ACHD 
specialists. Many ACHD patients are prone to develop arrhyth￾mias that often have to be managed acutely to prevent decom￾pensation.37 In ACHD patients admitted to critical care units, 
some special considerations apply. For example, blood pres￾sure readings are affected by common previous surgical proce￾dures (Blalock-Taussig-Thomas shunts and subclavian flap) and 
measurements should be taken from the contralateral side. Due 
to previous critical care admissions, multiple surgeries and pace￾maker leads, central venous access is frequently hampered by 
chronic vascular occlusion. A persistent left superior vena cava 
may result in a small right superior vena cava diameter causing 
problems for large catheters such as required for haemofiltration.
Patients with Down syndrome (commonly associated with 
congenital heart disease and immune defects) are at higher risk 
for pulmonary infections and ARDS.38
Patients with a functional univentricular heart in which biven￾tricular repair is not possible are nowadays mostly palliated with 
a Fontan-type operation. In these patients, the venae cava are 
connected directly to the pulmonary arteries lacking a subpul￾monary ventricular pump. Blood flow through the pulmo￾nary circulation is, thus, passive and is sensitive to increases in 
pulmonary vascular resistance.39 An increased risk of pulmonary 
arterial thrombosis in the case of ARDS could be expected.23
Central venous catheters can be placed as usual, but pressures 
will be equivalent to mean pulmonary pressures. Small fenes￾trations to the systemic ventricles are often present and may 
increase risk of air or paradoxical embolism.
In ACHD patients with cyanotic heart disease, oxygen satura￾tion <90% at rest or with exercise may be the norm. Cyanosis 
can be impressive with clubbing of fingers and toes. Treatment 
decisions must be guided by the baseline oxygen saturation before 
contracting COVID-19 in addition to current measurements. 
Parameters like respiratory rate and lactate levels rather than 
absolute values of oxygen saturation must serve as thresholds 
for oxygen dosing or switch to mechanical ventilatory support. 
Chronic cyanosis leads to an adaptive increase in haemoglobin 
levels that are required in this setting and should not be lowered 
by venesections.27 40 The risk for thromboembolic complications 
as well as bleeding are increased in cyanotic patients. They can be 
expected to deteriorate with even milder degrees of pulmonary 
involvement. Air filters should be placed on all venous cannulas 
in patients with (residual) right-to left shunts to prevent stroke 
from air emboly.
Mechanical ventilation and ARDS can lead to increase in 
pulmonary arterial pressures. Patients with right heart dilatation 
or dysfunction as in some patients with corrected tetralogy of 
Fallot with pulmonary regurgitation, severe Ebstein anomaly 
or with pulmonary arterial hypertension are potentially at 
increased risk of right heart failure.17 Pulmonary arterial hyper￾tension is known to be a risk factor for developing ARDS in the 
setting of pneumonia.41 To support right ventricular function, 
PEEP should to be kept to a minimum while prone positioning 
can be beneficial in reducing right ventricular afterload.42 In 
severe refractory right heart failure pharmacological reduction

Conclusion
The COVID-19 pandemic represents a significant challenge for 
the care of patients with severe chronic conditions, including 
ACHD. The virus directly affects the cardiovascular system, and 
pre-existent cardiovascular disease represents an important risk 
factor for morbidity and mortality in this setting. Despite the 
fact that ACHD patients have underlying cardiovascular disease, 
we contend that due to their younger age and the anatomical 
and physiological heterogeneity present across the ACHD spec￾trum, not all patients should be regarded as high-risk individ￾uals. Based on the anatomy of the underlying cardiac lesion 
and additional physiological considerations such as symptoms,

Box 1 Summary of specific considerations for severely 
affected ACHD patients
Key issues for critical care management of COVID-19 
patients with congenital heart disease
General considerations
► Admit to secondary or tertiary adults with congenital heart 
disease (ACHD) centre.
► Blood pressure readings affected by some surgical 
procedures. In this case, measurements should be taken from 
the contralateral side.
► Central venous access may be difficult due to chronic vascular 
occlusion or anomalous veins.
► Arrhythmias are frequent and can lead to rapid deterioration. 
Compare ECG with baselines.
► Impairment of lung function is prevalent in ACHD patients 
and should be expected to negatively influence disease 
course.
► Patients with Down syndrome are at higher risk for 
pulmonary infections and acute respiratory distress syndrome 
(ARDS).
Fontan-type circulation
► Central venous catheters can be placed as usual, but 
pressures will be equivalent to pulmonary arterial pressures.
► Small fenestrations to the systemic ventricles are often 
present and may increase risk of air/paradoxical embolism.
► Pulmonary blood flow sensitive to increases in pulmonary 
vascular resistance.
► An increased risk of pulmonary arterial thrombosis in the case 
of ARDS could be expected.
Cyanotic heart disease
► Oxygen saturations <90% at rest or with exercise are the 
norm.
► Treatment guided by oxygen saturation compared with 
baseline, respiratory rates and lactate levels.
► Haemoglobin levels should not be lowered by venesections.
► Increased risk for thromboembolic complications as well as 
bleeding.
► Expected to deteriorate with even milder degrees of 
pulmonary involvement.
► Air filters on all venous cannulas in patients with right-to left 
shunts to prevent stroke.
Patients with right heart dilatation or dysfunction
► Potentially at increased risk of right heart failure. Patients 
with pulmonary arterial hypertension may be at higher risk of 
developing ARDS.
► Mechanical ventilation and ARDS can lead to increase in 
pulmonary arterial pressures.
► Limit positive end expiratory pressure to a minimum.
► Prone positioning can be beneficial in reducing right 
ventricular pressure overload.
► In severe right heart failure, pharmacological reduction of 
pulmonary arterial pressures and extracorporeal membrane 
oxygenation can be considered.
exercise capacity, presence of heart failure, pulmonary hyper￾tension or cyanosis, we propose a pragmatic approach to cate￾gorising patients into low-risk, intermediate-risk and high-risk 
groups. This classification—while in need of refinement as new 
data emerge—may serve as a basis for recommending eligibility 
to continue work or educational engagement versus shielding 
at home, thus, balancing patients’ economic and psychosocial 
needs versus the perceived risk of adverse outcome in case of 
contracting COVID-19.
