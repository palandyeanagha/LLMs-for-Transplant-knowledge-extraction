Review Article
Introduction
In the United States, approximately 400,000 ventral hernias are 
repaired every year with an estimated cost of about 3 billion dollars 
[1]. Ventral hernias are a relatively morbid condition given that an 
intact abdominal wall is necessary for dynamic activities such as 
rotation of the torso, respiration, defecation/urination, emesis, and 
childbirth. 
The management of ventral hernias has evolved over the past 
several decades with advances in technology and knowledge. 
The first significant improvement was the use of prosthetic mesh 
reinforcement to simple suture repair alone [2]. As reported by 
Luijendijk, randomized controlled trials demonstrated a decrease 
in hernia recurrence rates from 43 percent to 24 percent [3,4].
Another major advancement was the popularization of the 
component separation technique as escribed by Ramirez [5]. This 
technique was found to be particularly useful in the case of large 
hernias where primary closure of the hernia defect is not possible 
otherwise. In addition, it eliminates the need for prosthetic mesh 
and its associated risks, while providing comparable or superior 
reduction in hernia recurrence [6-8]. Perhaps more importantly, the 
component separation technique provides a dynamic abdominal 
wall reconstruction, using innervated muscle which is critical to 
reducing hernia recurrence. In addition, component separation 
procedures provide an anatomic alignment of the muscles, which 
enhances abdominal wall function. 
 The advent and implementation of biologic mesh or acellular 
dermal matrices (ADM) has offered an additional valuable tool in 
the reconstructive armamentarium for ventral hernias [9]. ADM is 
superior to prosthetic mesh in setting of contaminated and high￾risk cases and is a valuable adjunct to the component separation 
technique [10-12]. Abdominal wall reconstruction with human 
acellular dermal matrices (HADM) has also been described [13]. 
However, since it has increase elasticity as compared to porcine 
or bovine ADMs, it can leave a significant bulge if used as an 
inter-positional bridge when myofascial continuity cannot be 
reestablished (Figure 1A & 1B).

Although component separation with biologic mesh 
reinforcement is effective, there is still not universal agreement as 
to the technique and location for mesh fixation [14]. For standard 
mesh fixation, the retro-muscular or underlay placements are most 
commonly used and are associated with lower recurrence rates 
[15,16]. There has been some difference in outcomes with different 
types of fixation for underlay indicating that the method of fixation 
is important [17]. Placement of sutures lateral to the junction of 
the linea alba and the anterior rectus sheath have been found to 
provide the greatest support and tolerance for tissue tension in 
studies on laparotomy closure [18].
The multipoint suture fixation offers a technique that combines 
these advantages for the patient undergoing abdominal wall 
reconstruction for ventral wall hernia, including the largest and 
most complex hernias as well as those with infected mesh and 
soft tissue deficiencies. The multipoint suture fixation technique 
is a physiologic approach to hernia reconstruction. The technique 
utilizes wide exposure to avoid injury to the hernia sac or contents. 
In patients who have had a prior midline incision, that is used. 
However, in patients without incisions on the abdomen, an 
abdominoplasty type incision has been found to have a number 
of advantages [19]. Local anesthesia with epinephrine is injected 
along the planned incisions to minimize bleeding and facilitate 
the dissection. The hernia sac and defect are circumscribed, and 
dissection is continued cephalad to the xyphoid. 
Component release incisions are made lateral to the lateral 
border of the rectus muscles to mobilize the rectus muscles to the 
midline. The location of the component release is determined by the 
width of the anterior rectus sheath. It is made at least 8 cms lateral 
to the midline inset of the rectus sheath. The fascia is released, and 
the external oblique muscle preserved. In patients in whom the 
loss of domain is greater, posterior release of the rectus sheath can 
be added as well. The two abdominal rectus muscles are brought 
together in the midline with several interrupted 0 Vicryl sutures 
to ensure alignment of the muscles. This is critical for two reasons, 
first as indicated previously, a lower recurrence rate is associated 
with patients in whom myofascial continuity is reestablished. 
Second, the proper alignment of is important for proper function 
of the muscles in the actions on the abdominal wall. Even a small 
deviation of the line of action can have a significant impact on the 
how effectively muscles function [20]. A looped 1 PDS is used as 
a continuous running horizontal mattress suture to imbricate 
the anterior fascia, which is the most effective suture technique 
[21]. This facilitates securing the anterior fascia just lateral to the 
junction of the linea alba and anterior rectus sheath where it is 
strongest [22].
The intentional selection of HADM to reinforce the abdominal 
wall fascia offers several advantages. Fascia takes approximately 
two months to gain 40% of its original strength, but original 
strength is never regained [23]. The addition of HADM provides not 
only a temporary increase in tensile strength of the abdominal, but 
as it integrates, it reinforces the native abdominal wall structure. 
 As compared to non-crosslinked xenograft ADMs, HADM 
provide more rapid vascular ingrowth and integration and greater 
tensile strength of the musculo-fascial interface [24]. The HADM 
has greater elasticity than non-cross-linked xenograft ADMS or 
any of the crosslinked ADMs. While this elasticity is a disadvantage 
for standard inset or interposition graft placement, with the 
multipoint fixation it offers the advantage of increased abdominal 
wall compliance.
The wide exposure open approach facilitates careful placement 
of the HADM. It is secured along the midline imbrication to bolster 
the inset of the two rectus abdominus muscles. Additional sutures 
are then placed in an offset row pattern working from the midline 
out laterally in each direction. Progressive tension sutures have 
been well-described to fix soft tissue in abdominoplasties to 
decrease seroma formation [25]. With each row additional traction 
displaces the HADM laterally as compared to the underlying fascia. 
This helps fix the HADM to the fascia to decrease the risk of seroma 
formation between the HADM and the fascia. In addition, the 
number of sutures strands used for fixation had been demonstrated 
to have a critical effect on the strength of fixation [26]. Perhaps 
more importantly, each row progressively offloads the tension on 
the midline inset of the muscles.
This technique specifically addresses the underlying concept 
that recurrences most often occur at the mesh-fascia interface. 
The structural design provides maximum interface of the anterior 
rectus sheath and the HADM. The progressive tension sutures 
provide an increased number of fixation points and off-load the 
inset of the muscles. The clinical results of this technique show 
that a multipoint fixation suture technique for abdominal wall 
reconstruction with component separation and onlay biologic 
mesh is reproducible and effective with low recurrence rates.
