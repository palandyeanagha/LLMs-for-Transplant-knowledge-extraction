ABSTRACT
Objective Patients with structural abnormalities of 
cardiac valves, including bicuspid aortic valve (BAV), are 
said to be at higher risk of infective endocarditis (IE). We 
sought to determine the risk of IE of the BAV compared 
with the tricuspid aortic valve (TAV) and to determine the 
risk of aortic valve replacement and mortality after IE.
Methods From medical records of two US and one 
Italian hospitals, patients with their first episode of IE 
of any native valve were identified. In the US cohort 42 
patients with BAV and 393 patients with TAV with IE 
occurring between 1 January 2000 and 30 June 2014 
were identified. In the Italian cohort 48 patients with 
BAV and 341 patients with TAV with IE underwent valve 
replacement surgery between 1 January 2000 and1 
November 2015. The risk of IE for BAV and TAV and 
subsequent outcomes were determined after matching to 
patients without IE.
Results After adjustment for risk factors, the risk of IE in 
the US cohort was 23.1 (95% CI 8.1 to 100, p<0.0001) 
times greater for BAV than TAV. Patients with BAV with IE 
were more likely to have an aortic root abscess. Within the 
subsequent 5 years, BAV patients with IE were more likely 
to undergo valve replacement (85%) than TAV patients 
with IE (46%). Patients with IE were at increased risk of 
death. The findings were similar in the Italian cohort.
Conclusions Patients with BAV are at markedly increased 
risk of IE and aortic root abscess than patients with TAV. 
Increased risk of IE in patients with BAV indicates they 
may be a candidate group for long-term trials of antibiotic 
prophylaxis of IE.
INTRODUCTION
Infective endocarditis (IE) is an uncommon 
but serious valvular heart disease with high 
morbidity and mortality.1
 Patients with 
structural abnormalities of cardiac valves, 
including bicuspid aortic valve (BAV), are said 
to be at higher risk of IE.2–5 BAV is the most 
common congenital valvular heart disease 
among adults, with a prevalence of 0.5%–2%6 
7
 and therefore patients with BAV constitute 
a significant proportion of patients with IE. 
As the prevalence of BAV in source popula￾tions is not precisely known, estimating the 
risk of IE in patients with BAV, compared with 
individuals with a tricuspid aortic valve (TAV) 
has been imprecise.
Antibiotic prophylaxis of IE in patients 
with BAV and other congenital valve diseases 
is currently not recommended,8 9 but is 
being debated.10 11 Although only very large 
randomised clinical trials of antibiotic 
prophylaxis will yield sufficient data to guide 
recommendations,12 it is known that indi￾viduals with structural heart disease are at 
increased risk of IE. However, the risk of IE 
in BAV, compared with TAV, is unknown and 
may indicate value of targeted antibiotic trials 
in this at-risk group.
We hypothesised that the risk of IE of the 
aortic valve would be higher for patients with 
a BAV than a TAV. We accounted for the 
unknown frequency of BAV in the source

Valvular heart disease
KEY QUESTIONS
What is already known about this subject?
► Infective endocarditis (IE) is an uncommon 
but serious valvular heart disease with high 
morbidity and mortality. Patients with structural 
abnormalities of cardiac valves, including bicuspid 
aortic valve (BAV), are said to be at higher risk of 
IE. Antibiotic prophylaxis of IE in patients with BAV 
and other congenital valve diseases is currently 
not recommended, but is being debated.
What does this study add?
► Our study finds that relative risk of IE of the BAV is 
markedly greater than for a tricuspid aortic valve 
(TAV). Patients with more comorbidities and lower 
income status were more likely to die within the 
following 5 years. Within the subsequent 5 years, 
patients with BAV with IE were more likely to have 
aortic root abscess and undergo valve replacement 
(85%) than patients with TAV with IE (46%).
How might this impact on clinical practice?
► Increased risk of IE in patients with BAV indicates 
they may be a candidate group for long-term trials 
of antibiotic prophylaxis of IE.

population using the frequency of non-aortic valve IE in 
both groups. The secondary hypothesis is that the occur￾rence of valve replacement and mortality after diagnosis 
of IE would be independent of aortic valve type (BAV vs 
TAV). Further, we wished to confirm a reported higher 
incidence of aortic root abscess in patients with BAV.13–15
We examined these hypotheses using the medical records 
of a US urban healthcare network and an Italian tertia￾ry-referral university-affiliated hospital.
METHODS
Patient populations
We used the medical records from two cohorts. From the 
medical records of an urban Massachusetts healthcare 
network (Partners Healthcare,Boston, Massachusetts, 
USA) that encompasses approximately 3.94million 
covered lives and with Institutional Review Board 
approval, we identified all adults (≥18 years) with 
their first episode of native valve IE occurring between 
1 January 2000 and 30 June 2014. Patients were identified 
by searches of International Classification of Diseases, 
Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) 
discharge diagnoses with the following codes: 421.0 
(acute and subacute IE), 421.1 (endocarditis, valve 
unspecified, in diseases classified elsewhere), 421.9 
(acute endocarditis,unspecified) and 424.9 (endocar￾ditis, valve unspecified) yielding 46 patients with BAV 
and 472 TAV with IE. Text searches and individual review 
of discharge summaries, surgical records,microbiology 
reports, and transthoracic and transoesophageal echo￾cardiogram reports were reviewed for diagnosis of BAV 
and IE. Patients with previous history of IE, previous valve 
replacement or repair, or congenital heart disease other 
than BAV were excluded from further analysis. Patients 
who met only the ‘definite’ modified Duke criteria of IE16
and received antibiotic treatment for IE were included 
in the analysis group of 41 patients with BAV IE and 371 
patients with TAV IE. The date of IE diagnosis was defined 
as the first day of the echocardiogram findings consistent 
with endocarditis. The censoring date for surgical and 
mortality outcomes was 1 October 2015. Patients were 
followed for an average of 4.8±3.9 years.
Two local Boston populations without IE were further 
identified for comparison of mortality outcomes. From 
a cohort of 4579 patients with BAV without history of 
IE obtained from the same source healthcare network, 
the 41 patients with BAV with IE were each matched to 
11–38 control patients with BAV without IE for age ± 10 
years, gender and race, yielding matching to a popula￾tion of 1081 patients with BAV without IE. Because the 
extent of functional degeneration of the BAV prior to 
IE was unavailable for the majority of patients with BAV, 
we did not use BAV structural abnormalities to match 
BAV IE cases with BAV IE controls. Patients with TAV 
with IE (n=371) were matched on an up to 50:1 basis 
to TAV patients without IE for age ± 10 years, gender, 
race and healthcare utilisation17 from the same source 
population who were not known to have a BAV, yielding 
a TAV control population of 18356 individuals matching 
on a 47–50:1 basis to 371 patients with TAV with IE. Two 
patients with TAV IE were unable to be matched. Sample 
size was determined by the number of patients with IE 
and an arbitrary cut-off of 50:1 control:case ratio.
Using a cohort of Italian patients who had under￾gone native valve replacement for IE we examined the 
frequency of outcomes after valve replacement from a 
single surgical centre’s institutional database (V Monaldi 
Hospital, University of Naples, Naples, Italy). The source 
population of all patients with IE was not available so 
direct comparisons with the US population were not 
possible. Prospective collection and review of discharge 
summaries, surgical records, microbiology reports, and 
transthoracic and transoesophageal echocardiogram 
reports was performed for diagnosis of BAV and IE. 
Patients with previous history of IE, previous valve replace￾ment or repair, or congenital heart disease other than 
BAV were excluded from further analysis. Patients who 
met ‘definite’ and ‘possible’ modified Duke criteria of 
IE16 and received surgery for IE between 1 January 2000 
and 1 November 2015 were included in the analysis 
group of 48 patients with BAV and 341 patients with TAV. 
The date of IE diagnosis was defined as the first day of the 
echocardiogram findings consistent with endocarditis. 
The censoring date for surgical and mortality outcomes 
was 15 November 2015. Patients were followed for an 
average of 3.2±2.6 years after IE in the Italian cohort.
Outcomes
The primary hypothesis was to evaluate whether the inci￾dence of aortic valve IE varies between patients with BAV 
and TAV. We implemented a case-control study design for 
this aim by first identifying 165 aortic valve-only IE cases 
among 412 patients with IE. The proportion of patients 
with BAV and TAV in the general population was not 
exactly known because a majority of patients with BAV is 
unaware of their BAV status until the occurrence of signif￾icant morbidity. Therefore, we used the patients with 
non-aortic valve IE as controls, assuming the proportions 
of patients with BAV/TAV are the same in patients with 
non-aortic valve IE and the general population, making 
the assumption that the incidence of IE of non-aortic 
valves would be the same between patients with BAV and 
TAV. We examined the incidence of aortic root abscess 
in patients with BAV by reviewing imaging records and 
operative reports. The secondary hypothesis was whether 
the risk of valve replacement and mortality after diag￾nosis of IE would be independent of aortic valve type. 
We examined this hypothesis using a combined outcome 
consisting of mortality and affected valve repair/replace￾ment, whichever occurred first, after the first diagnosis of 
IE in BAV and TAV cohorts compared with valve-respec￾tive controls without IE.
Among US patients hospitalised with endocarditis, we 
determined the rates of 1-year, 5year and 10-year all-cause 
mortality from the US Social Security Death Index and

local mortality resources, using the date of IE diagnosis 
for all mortality outcomes. For control patients without 
IE, we used the age of IE diagnosis of the matched patient 
with IE as beginning of the mortality observation period 
in the control patient. Overall mortality risk accounted for 
age, race, gender, decile of income estimated by postcode 
of residence18 19 and comorbidity assessed by modified 
Elixhauser Score20 derived from ICD-9 codes occurring 
between 5 years and 30 days prior to the diagnosis of IE 
and calculated using an R package.21 For control patients, 
the modified Elixhauser Score was estimated using ICD-9 
codes occurring between 5 years and 30 days prior to 
the age at the diagnosis of IE in their matched patients 
with IE. Comorbidities were calculated from ICD-9 codes 
using Elixhauser’s mapping.22 23 We also examined the 
frequency of valve surgery in IE cases and controls in the 
30 days and 5 years after the diagnosis of IE.24
Among Italian patients who had undergone valve 
surgery for IE, mortality was examined by patient, family 
and physician contact at defined intervals. Complete 
follow-up was achieved for all patients. Income deciles 
and Elixhauser Scores were unavailable.
Covariates
Diabetes was defined as having type I or II diabetes, with 
or without drug treatment. Chronic obstructive pulmo￾nary disease, cancer, lymphoma, renal and liver disease, 
obesity, alcohol and drug abuse, hypertension, conges￾tive heart failure, stroke, rheumatic heart disease and 
arrhythmia were defined by diagnostic codes and medical 
records review. Finally, we examined medical records for 
reports of potential precipitating events for IE.
Statistical methods
Statistical analysis was performed with R V.3.1 (https://
www.r-project.org) and SAS V.9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, 
North Carolina, USA). Categorical variables were 
summarised by frequency and analysed by χ2
 and Fish￾er's exact tests. For the primary hypothesis, since the 
incidence of aortic-value IE was extremely low (less than 
1:5000 person-years for BAV and lower for TAV), the OR 
estimated using a case-control study design would be a 
close approximation to the risk ratio. We interpreted the 
OR as risk ratios throughout this study. For the second 
hypothesis, Kaplan-Meier survival curves were compared 
using a two-sided non-parametrical log-rank test. Mortality 
analyses were conducted to assess the impact of valve 
type on short-term mortality and long-term mortality. 
Age was used as the time scale in the mortality anal￾yses. For each exposure, we first performed a univariate 
analyses, followed by Cox proportional hazards models, 
adjusting for gender, race, disease severity and socioeco￾nomic status. The proportional hazards assumption and 
assumption of linearity were tested using permutation 
testing based on martingale residuals. For all analyses, a 
two-sided p<0.05 was considered statistically significant. 
The funding source had no role in the study design, anal￾ysis, interpretation or submission of the results.
RESULTS
From the US IE cohort we identified 435 patients with 
their first episode of native valve definite IE according 
to modified Duke criteria (table 1). The relative risk 
of IE of a BAV was 23.1 (95% CI 8.1 to 100, p<0.0001) 
times greater than a TAV (table 2). This occurred 
despite patients with BAV being younger and having a 
lower overall frequency of comorbidities (table 1). The 
increased risk of IE in the BAV group was independent 
of patient age, with patients with BAV under 65 years of 
age having an IE relative risk of 15.6 (95% CI 4.9 to 50, 
p<0.0001). In patients with BAV, lower income decile 
and intravenous drug abuse were identified as indepen￾dent predictors of IE. In patients with TAV, lower income 
decile, intravenous drug or alcohol abuse, previous 
valvular heart disease and other comorbidities were iden￾tified as independent predictors of IE. Age, gender and 
race were not used as predictors of IE, as they had been 
used in matching IE cases to controls. Patients with IE 
were more likely to undergo repair or replacement of the 
affected valve within 30 days and 1 year of their episode 
of IE, than population controls (table 1).
The Italian surgical cohort had a similar overall demo￾graphic, but with differences in prevalence of liver 
disease, hypertension and an implanted device (table 3). 
Like the US cohort, the risk of IE requiring surgery of the 
aortic valve, compared with other valves, was greater for 
BAV than TAV (p<0.0001) with all patients with BAV IE 
undergoing aortic valve replacement surgery compared 
with only 54.6% in the TAV IE cohort (table 4).
Unadjusted mortality was higher in patients with TAV 
IE than patients with BAV IE at the 1-year and 5-year 
observation points in the US cohort. After adjustment for 
age and the presence of a BAV, gender and race were 
not predictors of mortality (figure 1A). IE did not quite 
reach statistical significance as a univariate (p=0.059) or 
multivariate (p=0.052) predictor of mortality in patients 
with a BAV (figure 1B). However, age, race, Elixhauser 
Comorbidity Score and income decile were independent 
predictors of mortality (table 5).
IE was a significant univariate (p<0.001) and multi￾variate (p<0.001) predictor of mortality in patients 
with a TAV (figure 2A). In addition, age, gender, race, 
Elixhauser Comorbidity Score and income decile were 
independent predictors of mortality (table 6). Based on 
an overall BAV prevalence of 1%, we observed a raw IE 
case rate of one case per 134,048 patients with TAV and 
12,658 patients with BAV per year.
In the Italian surgical cohort of patients undergoing 
valve repair or replacement for IE, mortality was higher 
in patients with TAV than patients with BAV at the 1-year 
and 5-year observations. Using Cox regression and after 
adjustment for age, the presence of a BAV (OR=0.71; 
95%CI 0.22 to 2.3, p=0.57) was not an independent 
predictor of mortality (figure 2B).
We observed a higher incidence of aortic root abscess 
in patients with BAV compared with patients with TAV

in both the US (21% vs 5%) and Italian cohorts (25% 
vs 18%). There was no evidence of a single organism 
being over-represented in patients with an aortic root 
abscess. Further, we observed a lower incidence of Staphy￾lococcus aureus infection in patients with BAV with IE than 
patients with TAV with IE, in both the US (19% vs 41%) 
and Italian (8% vs 17%) cohorts. Patients with BAV with 
IE were more likely to undergo valve replacement (85%) 
than patients with TAV with IE (46%), within the subse￾quent 5 years. Overall, patients with IE were much more 
likely to undergo valve replacement and were at increased 
risk of mortality than population controls.

We did not observe a sufficient number of potentially 
precipitating events for IE and were unable to deter￾mine the rate of dental procedures or other events in the 
control populations. We therefore do not report these 
results.
DISCUSSION
Using patient records of a large urban Massachusetts 
healthcare network and a large Italian cohort of patients 
with IE, we observed that patients with a native BAV are 
at markedly increased risk of aortic valve endocarditis 
compared with endocarditis of other native heart valves. 
The relative risk of IE of a BAV was markedly greater than 
for a TAV in both study cohorts. As the prevalence of BAV 
in source populations is not precisely known and the 
majority of patients with BAV are unaware of their BAV 
status until the occurrence of significant morbidity, esti￾mating the risk of IE in patients with BAV, compared with 
individuals with a TAV, has been imprecise. We there￾fore accounted for the unknown frequency of BAV in 
the source population using the frequency of non-aortic 
valve IE in both groups, making the assumption that the 
incidence of IE of non-aortic valves would be the same 
between patients with BAV and TAV. It is likely we observed 
a higher risk than recently reported25 by accounting for 
undiagnosed BAV in the community, by normalising the 
incidence of aortic valve IE and assuming equivalent risk 
of IE of other valves.
Older age and comorbidities measured by increased 
Elixhauser Score were significantly more frequent in 
patients with IE, independent of valve type. In the ageing 
population, there is a growing prevalence of patients with 
multiple comorbidities including end-stage renal disease 
and indwelling cardiac devices.26–28 In addition, there 
have been marked changes in the pattern of IE in the 
USA and the rest of the world,29 with reduced prevalence 
of rheumatic heart disease30 but an increased prevalence 
of intravenous drug use.31 32
The aetiology of BAV being associated with an 
increased frequency of IE is not established. It is can be 
hypothesised that altered flow patterns across the BAV 
may cause valvular endothelial injury, including platelet 
and fibrinogen deposition, that allows seeding of 
haematogenous bacteria33 and fungi. The wide variety 
of infecting organisms and absence of other evidence 
of immune deficiency does not favour a host-genome 
immunological defect in individuals with BAV. The 
observation that patients with BAV had a lower inci￾dence of S. aureus infection than patients with TAV 
cannot yet be explained.
IE was a predictor of mortality in the US TAV popula￾tion, but did not quite reach statistical significance in the 
BAV population, possibly because of the relatively small 
BAV IE population size and their younger age. S. aureus
was the culprit organism in 38% of the patients, and is 
a known independent predictor for mortality.15 27 34 In 
concordance with prior literature,14 15 patients with BAV 
with IE were much more likely to undergo valve replace￾ment than their TAV counterparts and to have concurrent 
abscess of the aortic root.
Study limitations
This study has several limitations due to its retrospective 
nature. Data were not reliably present for possible IE-ini￾tiating events, including the dental hygiene of the patient 
and prior antibiotic prophylaxis for procedures. Further, 
the extent of aortic valve disease prior to the episode of 
IE could not be reliably found for the majority of patients. 
Thus we cannot offer an estimate of relative risk between 
a normally functioning aortic valve and a structurally or 
functionally abnormal aortic valve. Further, we do not 
provide information on the risk of IE of an artificial valve, 
as the risk of artificial valve IE is probably not dependent 
on the native valve.
This study does not provide guidance on the use of 
antibiotics in patients with BAV. However, we did observe 
a very high risk of IE in patients with BAV, thus estab￾lishing their potential value as a target population for 
randomised trials of prophylactic antibiotics in proce￾dures prone to bacteraemia. The recent change in 
guidelines was largely motivated by the attempt to provide 
antibiotic prophylaxis to the highest-risk patients under￾going the highest-risk procedures. Although to this day, 
there is no randomised controlled study that tested the 
efficacy of antibiotic prophylaxis, BAV clearly increases 
the risk of IE in the otherwise healthy patient population. 
Our study suggests re-examination of congenital valvular 
heart disease among risk groups but does not provide any 
information regarding prophylactic administration of 
antibiotics prior to at-risk procedures. Patients with BAV 
should be encouraged to report symptoms of IE early to 
potentially reduce the risk of aortic root abscess. This 
study also highlights the risk of IE from intravenous drug 
use in patients with BAV.

Patients are classified as having IE of only the aortic valve, or having IE of any other valve including, or not including, the aortic valve. The 
observed risk ratio of having endocarditis of only the aortic valve was increased 23.1 times if the aortic valve was bicuspid (CI 8.1 to 100), 
p<0.0001.
