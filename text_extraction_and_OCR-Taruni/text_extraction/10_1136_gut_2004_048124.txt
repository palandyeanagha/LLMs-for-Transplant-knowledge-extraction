Background: Several prognostic models have been developed to stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)
but there is no general consensus on which is the most reliable. We compared three prognostic indices
(Okuda, CLIP, and BCLC scoring systems) in a large series of cirrhotic patients with HCC undergoing non￾surgical treatment in terms of their ability to classify patients into different risk groups
Methods: We retrospectively studied 268 Italian patients with HCC. A total of 146 patients were treated
with ablation, 132 with percutaneous ethanol injection, and 14 with radiofrequency ablation; 103
underwent transcatheter arterial chemoembolisation and 19 had supportive care alone. Factors
determining survival were analysed by univariate and multivariate analysis using the Kaplan-Meier
method and Cox proportional hazard regression models. Okuda, CLIP, and BCLC scores evaluated before
treatment were applied.
Results: Median survival was 25.7 months. In a multivariate analysis, portal vein thrombosis,
a fetoprotein, total bilirubin, and tumour size were significant predictors of survival. Okuda, CLIP, and
BCLC scores were all able to predict survival (p,0.001). They identified two, four, and six risk groups,
respectively, with a median survival ranging from 27 to 19 months for Okuda, 30 to 5 months for CLIP,
and 43 to 7 months for BCLC.
Conclusions: Both CLIP and BCLC scores were more effective than the Okuda score in stratifying patients
into different risk groups with early-intermediate HCC. However, the BCLC scoring system gave a better
prediction of prognosis in patients with disease diagnosis at a very early stage.
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third most
frequent cause of death from cancer in the world. Its
incidence varies between 500 000 and 1 000 000 cases
a year.1 In the Western world, HCC is closely associated with
hepatic cirrhosis, which is present in 70–80% of all cases.2–4
For this reason, cirrhotic patients are encouraged to undergo
regular ultrasound screening. In fact, early detection, when
the tumour is still small, increases the options for therapy
and the likelihood of cure.5 6 Tumour staging, which is the
basis for therapeutic management, has traditionally been
based on the Okuda system (table 1), which was developed
18 years ago.7 At that time, early diagnosis of HCC was
relatively rare, and the staging system was therefore based on
data from patients with advanced disease.
The Cancer of the Liver Italian Program (CLIP) score8
(table 2) is a newer staging system that has been validated in
case series from various parts of the world.9 10 Although its
predictive power has been found to be superior to that of the
Okuda system in most cases, doubts have been raised
regarding its value in certain populations.11 A second
alternative is the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC)
staging system12 (table 3), which, in theory, has certain
advantages. Among the prognostic variables considered in
BCLC staging are performance status (PS)13 and portal
hypertension, which are not taken into account in either
the CLIP or Okuda system. These additional criteria should
make it especially suitable for staging HCCs diagnosed early
in patients with well compensated cirrhosis.
The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the
influence on survival of a series of variables (clinical features,
laboratory parameters, imaging data, treatment modalities)
established at the time of HCC diagnosis. Cases were then
retrospectively staged using the Okuda, CLIP, and BCLC
systems to identify which system provided the most accurate
prediction of survival.
METHODS
In this retrospective study, we analysed clinical, aetiological,
and therapeutic variables in 268 asymptomatic patients with
HCC observed between March 1992 and May 2002 in our
institution. In most cases (232/268; 86.6%) the tumours had
been detected by abdominal ultrasound studies and/or a
fetoprotein (AFP) assays, performed at six month intervals as
part of a screening programme for cirrhotic patients aimed at
early detection of HCC. Each focal lesion detected was further
evaluated by multiphase spiral computed tomography (CT) or
contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The
presence of enhancement in the arterial phase was consid￾ered diagnostic for HCC if the lesion was larger than 2 cm.
Until the year 2000, before treatment and independently of
the results of the imaging studies, whenever possible we
routinely performed an ultrasound guided fine needle-biopsy
study of the focal lesion.14 After 2000, ultrasound guided
biopsies were confined to doubtful cases (lesions smaller

than 2 cm or without arterial enhancement on CT or MRI).6
In the remaining 36 cases (in which cases of chronic hepatitis
were included), the imaging studies and/or laboratory work
up had been done for other reasons.
The clinical features of the study population (mean age
65.4 years; range 42–83) at the time of HCC diagnosis are
summarised in table 4. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection was
the most common cause of chronic liver disease and was
detected by means of third generation ELISAs for HCV
antibodies and/or polymerase chain reaction assays for HCV
RNA. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection was documented by
hepatitis B surface antigen positivity and/or positivity for
HBV DNA in polymerase chain reaction assays. Alcohol
related liver disease was diagnosed based on a clinical history
of alcohol abuse (exceeding 24 g/day in males or 16 g/day in
females).15
The vast majority of patients studied had cirrhosis but most
had well compensated disease according to the Child-Pugh
score (table 4).16 The diagnosis of cirrhosis was confirmed by
liver biopsy in 190/259 (73,4%) cases; in the remaining 69,
cirrhosis was diagnosed based on clinical and blood
chemistry findings indicative of chronic liver disease together
with evidence of portal hypertension (defined by the presence
of hepatic vein pressure gradient >10 mm Hg, splenomegaly
with a platelet count ,100 000/mm3
, oesophageal varices, or
ascites12). Ascites was mild in all positive cases. Portal vein
thrombosis (PVT) was present in a minority of cases (4.1%)
at the time of HCC diagnosis.
Most patients (155/268) had a single lesion. Of the 113
patients with multiple nodules, 53 had two lesions and the
remaining 60 had three or more lesions. The mean diameter
of the largest lesion was 3.7 cm (range 1.5–10.7). In 249/268
patients (93%) the final diagnosis of HCC was based on
cytological and/or histological analysis of ultrasound guided
fine needle biopsy specimens.14 In the remaining 19, biopsies
had not been performed because imaging findings and serum
AFP levels (.400 ng/ml) were already considered diagnostic
of HCC.6
Pretreatment staging was based on contrast enhanced CT
in 241 cases; MRI was used in the remaining 27 patients who
were allergic to iodised intravenous contrast agents and/or
had signs of renal failure. Distant metastases were excluded
in all cases based on chest x ray findings and bone scans.
All of the patients referred to our institution with HCC
complicating liver cirrhosis were primarily screened for liver
transplantation17 or resective surgery.18 19 The 268 patients we
treated had been excluded from surgical treatment for the
following reasons: Child-Pugh class B (n = 50), multiple
lesions (n = 82), single lesion larger than 5 cm (n = 14), or
serious portal hypertension (defined as platelet count lower
than 100 000/ml and the presence of ascites and/or oesopha￾geal varices) or the presence of portal vein thrombosis
(n = 68). The remaining patients were excluded because of
unacceptable surgical risk (related to the presence of chronic
extrahepatic diseases or unfavourable location of the tumour
in the liver parenchyma) evaluated by the consulting surgeon
(n = 31), age older than 75 years (n = 12), and refusal of the
patient to undergo liver resection or transplantation (n = 11).
HCC treatments performed are shown in table 4.
Over half of the patients were treated with percutaneous
ethanol injection (PEI) alone. The second most common
therapeutic approach was transhepatic arterial chemoembo￾lisation (TACE). Of the 103 patients who received this type of
treatment, 39 also received PEI before or after TACE.
Fourteen others were treated with radiofrequency thermal
(RFA) ablation, and the remaining 19 received supportive
care alone. PEI or RFA were generally reserved for patients
with single lesions less than 5 cm, or with up to three lesions,
each less than 3 cm. Transarterial chemoembolisation was
applied to patients with a single lesion less than 5 cm which
was difficult to inject with alcohol under ultrasound
guidance or to patients with single lesions larger than 5 cm
or with multiple lesions involving less than 50% of the liver
parenchyma. In a small number of cases combined treat￾ments (TACE plus PEI or RFA) were applied to patients who
had residual viability of the treated lesion after one or more
TACE procedures. Supportive care alone was provided to
patients with multifocal bilobar disease and/or vascular
invasion. PEI, RFA, and TACE were performed using
standardised protocols.20–22 After treatment, patients were
regularly followed up at three month intervals. In the case of
local recurrence of the primary lesion or the occurrence of
new nodules, a new treatment was usually planned and
performed according to the same criteria used to treat the
primary lesion.
Statistical analysis
Survival of patients was the single end point used to assess
the performance of the different scoring systems. Length of
survival was calculated from the date of HCC diagnosis to the
date of death or, in the case of survivors, the date of the last
follow up visit. Survival curves were estimated by the Kaplan￾Meier method and compared, for univariate analysis, by the
log rank test. For evaluation of continuous variables, patients
were divided in two groups based on the median value in the
study group as a whole. Significant parameters at univariate

analysis were entered into a multivariate Cox regression
model to identify independent predictors of survival.
Comparison of the Okuda, CLIP, and BCLC scoring
systems
The prognostic performance of each scoring system was
statistically assessed, evaluating homogeneity within classi￾fication groups, discriminatory ability, and monotonicity of
the gradients in the association between stages and survival
rates.10 Thus we used a multistep approach.
Firstly we evaluated, at univariate analysis, the capacity of
each score to distinguish categories of patient with signifi￾cantly different survival (homogeneity of the score). For each
score, this performance was evaluated by comparing by log
rank test the survival curves of the single categories,
calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method.
Next, we needed to compare the overall predictive power of
survival for each scoring system to assess which gave the
most accurate prediction of survival (monotonicity of the
score). This point was evaluated by the linear trend x2 test,
entering each scoring system into a Cox regression model.
Finally, to evaluate the discriminatory ability for the
prediction of survival, we evaluated the accuracy of predic￾tion of death at one, three, and five years for each scoring
system. This point was evaluated calculating the area under
the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for each
score (which is equivalent to the concordance statistic (c
statistic)).23 To perform this test, patients censored before
one, three, and five years were excluded from the analysis.
RESULTS
Mean duration of follow up was 32 months (range 3–130). At
the end of follow up, 144/268 (53.7%) patients had died.
Survival rates at one, three, and five years were 92%, 46%,
and 24%, respectively (fig 1).
Univariate analysis
Using the Kaplan-Meier method, we evaluated possible
correlations between survival and 17 dichotomised variables
with known values for all 268 patients (table 5). The nine
factors that had a significant negative correlation with
survival in the log rank test were: positivity for hepatitis B
surface antigen, AFP .22.5 ng/ml, serum albumin ,3.5 g/dl,
total bilirubin .1.5 mg/dl, platelet count ,1006109
/l, pre￾sence of ascites, presence of PVT, tumour diameter .3.7 cm,
and presence of two or more neoplastic nodules.
Multivariate analysis
Multivariate analysis of the nine factors listed above (Cox
proportional hazard regression) revealed that the following
variables were independent predictors of survival: PVT, AFP
levels, total bilirubin, tumour size (table 6).

Staging systems as predictors of survival in the study
population
Table 7 shows the results of retrospective staging of the 268
patients using the Okuda, CLIP, and BCLC systems, with
median survival times and death rates. There was a
significant correlation between survival and tumour stage
assigned using all three systems (Okuda p,0.001; CLIP
p,0.001; BCLC p,0.001). With all three methods the vast
majority of cases were classified as early stage tumours—that
is, Okuda stage I (190/268; 70%); CLIP stages 0–1 (211/268;
78%); and BCLC stage A (224/268; 82%)—and none of the
patients had advanced disease (Okuda stage III, CLIP stages
5–6, or BCLC stage D). Median survival of the 190 patients
with Okuda stage I tumours (27.2 months) was significantly
longer than that of the 78 stage II patients (19.2 months)
(p,0.001).
BCLC stages in our population ranged from A1 to C
(table 7). Significant differences were found among survival
rates of subgroups with stage A, B, and C tumours (A v B
p,0.01; B v C p = 0.04). The A1 subgroup, which included
patients with single HCC nodules ,3 cm in diameter and no
signs of portal hypertension, was characterised by a
significantly longer survival compared with that of the stage
A2 subgroup (p = 0.04). Survival in the BCLC A2 subgroup
was also better than that of stage A3 (p = 0.05), but there
were no significant differences between the A3 and A4
subgroups (p = 0.25). However, the differences in survival
between BCLC A1-A4 may not be reliable because of the
small sample size.
The CLIP stages assigned in the study population ranged
from 0 to 4 (table 7), and log rank analysis revealed
significant differences in the duration of survival for each
subgroup with the exception of stages 2 and 3 (CLIP 0 v 1
p,0.01; 1 v 2 p = 0.01; 2 v 3 p = 0,11; 3 v 4 p = 0.04). Patients
in CLIP stage 4 had a particularly unfavourable prognosis,
with a median survival of 4.8 months from diagnosis.
Both the CLIP and BCLC systems identified distinct
subgroups with a different prognosis within each Okuda
stage. In particular, BCLC restaging of the 190 patients with
Okuda stage I HCCs revealed a subgroup of 30 patients whose
tumours were classified as BCLC stage A1 and who showed a
mean survival longer than that observed in the whole group
(43.4 months v 27.2 months). In contrast, the seven patients
classified as BCLC stage B and the three patients classified as
BCLC stage C had a worse prognosis than that predicted by
the median of the group as a whole: 17.6 and 7.4 months,
respectively, versus 27.2 months (fig 2A). Similar results
were seen when the 78 Okuda stage II patients (mean
survival 19.4 months) were reclassified with the BCLC
system: eight of these cases were stage C tumours and mean
survival of this group was only seven months (fig 2B). When
considering CLIP restaging of Okuda I patients, no significant
survival differences were found among subgroups (fig 3A).
Within the group of Okuda II patients, only the CLIP 0
subgroup had a significantly longer survival than the other
groups (fig 3B).
When entered into a Cox regression model, the BCLC score
showed slightly better performance in prediction of overall
survival compared with the CLIP and Okuda scores (table 8).
BCLC showed a better performance compared with CLIP and
Okuda even when patients treated by PEI and TACE (table 8)
were considered separately.
Discriminatory ability for death at one, three, and five
years, evaluated by ROC curve area analysis, was slightly
higher for BCLC compared with CLIP and Okuda. While no
significant difference was found at one year, BCLC and CLIP
showed a significantly better discriminatory ability at three
and five years compared with the Okuda score. No significant
difference was found comparing BCLC and CLIP scores at
one, three, and five years (table 9).

DISCUSSION
The prognosis for cirrhotic patients who develop HCC
continues to be poor, with a five year survival rate of 6% in
the USA.1 The various forms of treatment available for these
tumours are effective in improving survival only when the
disease is diagnosed at an early stage (that is, when tumour
diameter is less than 5 cm and liver function is still normal).
For patients with larger tumours and decompensated
cirrhosis (Child-Pugh class B or C), no treatment appears to
be capable of prolonging survival.24 Ultrasound screening of
patients with chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis has increased
the frequency of preclinical diagnosis of HCC,25 and conse￾quently curative therapy (that is, resection, liver transplanta￾tion, PEI, RFA, and TACE) is considered possible in a growing
number of cases.
Tumour staging at the time of diagnosis is essential to
identify these cases and decide which type of therapy is the
most appropriate. The Okuda system is proving to be
inadequate for today’s HCC cases, particularly those that
are diagnosed early. Designed for use in a population with
relatively advanced neoplastic disease, the Okuda system’s
current shortcomings include a lack of distinction between
uni- and multifocal tumours and its neglect of factors such as
AFP levels, PVT, local-regional lymph node involvement and
PS, whose prognostic significance has been unequivocally
confirmed in both surgical and non-surgical series.26–30
In recent years, several alternative staging systems have
been proposed8 11 31–33 but there is still a lack of consensus
regarding their relative accuracies and applicability.
Significant biological variability related to the various
aetiological/pathogenetic aspects of these tumours and our
incomplete understanding of their natural history are two of
the factors complicating the staging process.34
The system proposed by the Cancer of the Liver Italian
Program (CLIP) in 1998 was based on a retrospective
study8
and was subsequently prospectively validated.35 The
CLIP studies identified five independent prognostic variables:
Child-Pugh class of cirrhosis, tumour size, number of lesions,
presence/absence of PVT, and serum levels of AFP. On the
whole, CLIP stages have proved to be more accurate than the
Okuda classification scheme in the prediction of survival,
particularly in early stage disease.8 The validity of this system
has been confirmed in two large retrospective studies in
Canada and Japan9 10 but in the largest series evaluated thus
far (906 Patients in China), CLIP staging displayed very low
correlation with survival.11 This discrepancy may be related to
the fact that the majority of Chinese patients had HBV related
liver disease whereas HCV was the most common risk factor
in the Canadian and Japanese studies (as well as in those
conducted in other Western countries).
The BCLC staging system was developed based on a
retrospective analysis of various studies of HCC patients with
early, intermediate, and advanced-terminal disease, which
attempted to identify prognostically relevant variables for
each group.12 For patients with early stage disease, survival
was negatively correlated with portal hypertension and
bilirubin levels .1.5 mg/dl; for intermediate stages, the
significant variable was a large multinodular tumour; and
for advanced disease, deterioration of PS and the presence of
vascular infiltration. These variables were used to supplement
those included in the Okuda staging system. To our knowl￾edge, only two attempts have been made to compare the CLIP
and BCLC systems. In the first study, both scores displayed
prognostic values inferior to that of oestrogen receptor
status36; in the latter, BCLC proved to have a higher
prognostic power than CLIP in 187 HCC patients undergoing
surgical or non-surgical treatment.37
In our study, none of the patients had undergone surgical
resection or liver transplantation, and all had received non￾surgical forms of treatment. Furthermore, all of the tumours
had been diagnosed before they had provoked symptoms as
the vast majority of the patients had been subjected to
periodic ultrasound screening for early detection of HCC.
Mean duration of survival in the total population
(25.7 months) was comparable (20 months) with that
reported in a population similar to ours for the percentage
of tumours diagnosed at the preclinical stages and for the
number of patients with confirmed cirrhosis at the time of
diagnosis.8 The high prevalence of cirrhosis in ours and the
CLIP study populations8
is probably largely responsible for the
lower survival rates with respect to those reported by Ueno et
al (mean 37.7 months) in a group that included a much
higher percentage (19.2%) of patients with no evidence of
cirrhosis at the time of HCC diagnosis.10
Multivariate analysis showed that independent predictors
of survival were mostly related to the cancer itself (tumour
diameter ,3 cm, absence of PVT, and low serum AFP) while
only a low bilirubin serum level was significantly related to
survival among the parameters of liver function. CLIP and
BCLC restaging of these patients was possible as information
was available in all cases for all of the variables included in
both systems, including PS. In fact, all of our patients had a

PS of 0, reflecting the absence of symptoms at the time of
diagnosis. Both the BCLC and CLIP systems proved to be
superior to the Okuda system, distinguishing within each
Okuda stage various subgroups that were distinct in terms of
survival. On the whole, when the two new systems were
compared, BCLC proved to be the more accurate predictor of
survival, even if its discriminating power at three and five
years did not differ significantly from that provided by the
CLIP score.
Moreover, in our patients, BCLC staging offered two
important advantages: better differentiation of early stage
HCCs and inclusion in the score of PVT presence. In fact,
stage A included four subgroups that were significantly
different in terms of survival. The best prognosis was
associated with stage A1 cases (mean survival 43.4 months)
and this was probably due to the fact that none of the A1
patients had tumours .3 cm, portal hypertension, or
elevated bilirubin levels—each of which is known to have a
negative influence on survival in both surgical and non￾surgical series.30 38 39 Interestingly, both tumour size and
bilirubin level were independent predictors of survival, even
in our series. In contrast, almost half (53/129) of the CLIP 0
patients had lesions .3 cm, and in 21 cases the tumours
were .4 cm. Furthermore, findings indicative of portal
hypertension (which is not considered in CLIP staging) were
present in 163 (60.8%) patients. Consequently, CLIP stage 0
was associated with a mean survival of only 30.1 months.
Other groups have reported considerably better survival
values for patients of this type, ranging from 42.5 to
68.7 months.8 10 The difference is probably related to the
inclusion in the latter two studies of a number of patients
who underwent surgical resection.
The second advantage of BCLC staging is that it reflects the
presence or absence of PVT. In our experience, survival in
patients with PVT at the time of diagnosis is invariably
limited, and this effect is independent of the presence of
other prognostically negative factors. In patients with HCC,
PVT is generally indicative of neoplastic invasion of the
vascular compartment.40 In the present study, eight of the 11
patients with PVT died within eight months after diagnosis.
The outcome of the other three cases is unknown as the
patients were lost to follow up 3–4 months after diagnosis.
BCLC staging classified all 11 of these patients as stage C
(mean survival 7.4 months). In contrast, with the CLIP
system, seven of the PVT patients were classified as stage 2 or
3, both of which were associated with considerably longer
survival (17.7 and 16.8 months, respectively). The remaining
four were classified as stage 4.
Several follow up studies have shown that even mild
elevations in serum AFP levels predict a worse prognosis,
regardless of whether the patient is treated with surgery or
PEI.30 41 AFP levels are one of the variables considered in the
CLIP system but are not included in the BCLC. In terms of
prognostic accuracy, this difference does not appear to be
important. In fact, the CLIP definition of an AFP elevation is
.400 ng/ml. While this cut off is widely accepted as
diagnostic for HCC, only 19/268 (7%) of our patients had
levels this high at the time of diagnosis, and eight of these
also had PVT, which automatically placed them in BCLC
stage C.
In conclusion, in this series of patients with asymptomatic
HCCs diagnosed at the early to intermediate phases and
treated with non-surgical modalities, both the CLIP and
BCLC systems provided more precise estimates of survival
than the Okuda system. The BCLC system appeared to be
more accurate than the CLIP score in identifying prognos￾tically favourable cases (small tumours ,3 cm in patients
with well compensated liver function and no portal hyper￾tension) as well as those in whom survival was likely to be
limited (due to the presence of macroscopically evident
vascular invasion).

Postprandial abdominal pain, megaloblastic anaemia, and severe weight loss in an 80 year old
man
Clinical presentation
An 80 year old man with no previous medical history was
referred to our hospital with progressive weight loss of 24 kg
in the past 12 months. There were no episodes of diarrhoea,
fever, night sweats, nausea, or vomiting in the past
12 months. Physical examination revealed a significant
reduction in the patient’s general and nutritional status
(weight 56 kg, size 178 cm, body mass index 17.6 kg/m2
),
symmetrical oedema of the forearms and lower legs, and
pleural effusions. Pathological laboratory findings included:
erythrocyte sedimentation rate 82 mm/h; C reactive protein
3.8 mg/dl (normal 0.8 mg/dl); serum protein 5.6 g/dl (normal
6.5–8.5 g/dl); serum albumin 1.8 g/dl (normal 3.6–5.0 g/dl);
serum iron 3.3 mmol/l (normal 10.6–26.0 mmol/l); haemo￾globin 10.7 g/dl (normal 14–18 g/dl); MCV 119.7 fl (normal
86–101 fl); and vitamin B12 74 pg/ml (normal 199–730 pg/ml).
Computed tomography scans of the chest and abdomen
showed symmetrical pleural effusions but no signs of a solid
tumour. Upper endoscopy, including histological examination
of the stomach and duodenum, revealed no pathological
findings. Total colonoscopy and ileoscopy demonstrated a
diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon. Histological examination of
colonic biopsies did not reveal any pathological findings.
Radiographic enteroclysis was performed (fig 1).
Question
What is the diagnosis? What additional investigations are
necessary?
