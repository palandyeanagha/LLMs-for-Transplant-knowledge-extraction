Wound infections are a major cause of postoperative morbidity
in patients undergoing kidney transplantation. These patients
can then be at risk for graft loss and mortality as well.1 Beyond
the routine risk of surgical site infections for standard proce￾dures, kidney transplantation bears the added risk caused by its
obligate medication regimented immunosuppression. Immu￾nosuppressive agents inhibit the inflammatory cytokines that
are responsible for transplant rejection. These cytokines are
also responsible for the initial inflammatory phase of wound
healing.2 Furthermore, many patients with end-stage renal
disease have concomitant diabetes or obesity which are addi￾tional independent risk factors for surgical site infection.
The risk of infection is greater in the first year after
transplantation.3 Reports of wound infections range from

Abstract Wound infections are a major cause of morbidity after kidney transplantation. The
purpose of our study was to evaluate an improved technique of wound closure. Data
corresponding to 104 consecutive live donor kidney recipients were prospectively
collected and analyzed. Our routine standard technique involved closure of the
abdominal wall muscle and fascia in one layer with interrupted nonabsorbable full
thickness sutures. No drains were used. The skin was closed with interrupted 2–0 nylon
sutures 4 to 5 cm apart, leaving the skin and subcutaneous tissue in between partially
open. Patients were allowed to shower starting on the first postoperative day.
Examination of the wounds was continued for at least 1 month postoperatively, and
then routinely as needed. All patients were thoroughly informed preoperatively of our
technique. There were no immediate postoperative wound infections. There were no
instances of dehiscence, evisceration, or need for revision. All patients were able to
continue with their routine daily activities. Cosmetic results were satisfactory in all
cases. We did not experience any patient complaints with respect to our technique.
Patient satisfaction scores conducted by Press Ganey and Associates ranked in the 99
percentile with respect to peers undergoing kidney transplantation. Three patients
returned six months postoperatively with suture granulomas which were treated
nonoperatively. Partial closure of the skin wound with no associated drains is an
effective and cosmetically desirable way to decrease the incidence of postoperative
infections in kidney transplantation.

104 to 27%,5 with up to 25% requiring radiological or surgical
intervention.6 Risk factors for impaired wound healing after
kidney transplantation include body mass index >30, dialysis
pretransplantation, plasmapheresis after transplantation,
treatment of acute rejection with thymoglobulin, immuno￾suppression induction with mycophenolate mofetil,6 main￾tenance immunosuppression with sirolimus, recipient age
>60, diabetes, and delayed graft function.7
Despite the literature on patient factors and clinical course
related to wound infections in kidney transplantation, there is
scant literature regarding skin closure methods and their
relation to postoperative wound infections. Large abdominal
incisions, including kidney transplant recipients are most
commonly closed with nonabsorbable skin staples. Other
reported methods include subcutaneous closure with 4–0
Monocryl or interrupted mattress closure with 2–0 nylon. A
small series describes the use of a subcutaneous absorbable
stapling device.8
We have made it our practice to use partial wound closure
in kidney transplant recipients. There is evidence to suggest
decreased rates of wound infections in the orthopedic and
trauma literature through the use of partial wound closure.9
There have been no reports of the use of this method and its
relation to postoperative wound infection in kidney trans￾plantation. The purpose of our study was to decrease the rate
of wound infections in kidney transplantation through the
use of partial skin wound closure.
Methods
Data corresponding to 104 consecutive live donor kidney
recipients were prospectively collected and analyzed. Our
routine standard technique involved performing the arterial
and venous anastomoses followed by reperfusion of the renal
allograft. A tension-free anastomosis was constructed with
5–0 synthetic absorbable sutures encompassing full thickness
of both ureter and bladder. No drains were left in the
perinephric space. The abdominal wall muscle and fascia
were closed in one layer with interrupted nonabsorbable
full thickness sutures. The skin was closed with interrupted
2–0 nylon sutures 4 to 5 cm apart, leaving the skin and
subcutaneous tissue in between partially open.
Examination of the wounds was continued for at least
1 month postoperatively, and then routinely as needed.
Wound infection was defined as an infection occurring within
30 days of surgery and involving the skin, subcutaneous, or
deep soft tissues at the surgical wound site with any clinical
features such as purulent discharge from the incision, pain,
tenderness swelling, redness, heat, or fever.5 The examination
was performed by the surgeons and nephrologists of the
transplantation center. All patients were thoroughly in￾formed preoperatively of our technique.
Results
There were no immediate postoperative wound infections as
determined clinically. There were no instances of dehiscence,
evisceration, lymphocele, or need for revision. All patients
were able to continue with their routine daily activities; there
was no need for visiting nurse services or home care. Patients
were permitted to shower on postoperative day 1. Cosmetic
results were satisfactory in all cases. We did not experience
any patient complaints with respect to our technique. Patient
satisfaction scores conducted by Press Ganey and Associates
ranked in the 99 percentile with respect to peers undergoing
kidney transplantation. Three patients presented 6 months
posttransplantation to the outpatient transplantation center
with suture granulomas and were treated nonoperatively
with swift recovery (►Table 1).
Conclusions
Partial closure of the skin in kidney transplant wounds is an
effective way to decrease the incidence of postoperative
infections and provides satisfactory cosmetic results. Preop￾erative discussion with patients optimizes satisfaction. We
believe that partial wound closure allows adequate drainage
of any possibly infected material in the early postoperative
period. Once drainage is achieved, the wound heals by
secondary intention without tension. The low infection rate
coupled with high patient satisfaction shows that this skin
closure method is effective in achieving its stated goal and
may be superior to standard practices.
