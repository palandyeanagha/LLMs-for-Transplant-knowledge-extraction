Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is a group of disorders
characterised by monoclonal proliferation of histiocytic cells
(Langerhans cells) producing tumour-like masses in multiple organs
including the bone, skin, lymph nodes and central nervous system.
In contrast to multiorgan LCH, pulmonary LCH (PLCH) usually
involves only a single organ and presents as an infiltrative lung
disease. PLCH is strongly correlated with smoking and presumably
reflects reactive Langerhans cell proliferation triggered by some
inhaled agent.1 In early cellular PLCH, Langerhans cells aggregate
in multiple small bronchiolocentric granulomas which may further
cavitate to form inflammatory thick-walled cysts, usually
predominating in the upper lobes. With disease progression, PLCH
may evolve towards irreversible lung destruction by cicatricial


fibrotic thin-walled cysts, respiratory insufficiency and death or …
