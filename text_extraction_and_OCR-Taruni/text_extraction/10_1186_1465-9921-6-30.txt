Abstract
Background: Sub-epithelial extracellular matrix deposition is a feature of asthmatic airway
remodelling associated with severity of disease, decline in lung function and airway
hyperresponsiveness. The composition of, and mechanisms leading to, this increase in subepithelial
matrix, and its importance in the pathogenesis of asthma are unclear. This is partly due to
limitations of the current models and techniques to assess airway remodelling.
Methods: In this study we used a modified murine model of ovalbumin sensitisation and challenge
to reproduce features of airway remodelling, including a sustained increase in sub-epithelial matrix
deposition. In addition, we have established techniques to accurately and specifically measure
changes in sub-epithelial matrix deposition, using histochemical and immunohistochemical staining
in conjunction with digital image analysis, and applied these to the measurement of collagen and
proteoglycans.
Results: 24 hours after final ovalbumin challenge, changes similar to those associated with acute
asthma were observed, including inflammatory cell infiltration, epithelial cell shedding and goblet
cell hyperplasia. Effects were restricted to the bronchial and peribronchial regions with
parenchymal lung of ovalbumin sensitised and challenged mice appearing histologically normal. By
12 days, the acute inflammatory changes had largely resolved and increased sub-epithelial staining
for collagen and proteoglycans was observed. Quantitative digital image analysis confirmed the
increased deposition of sub-epithelial collagen (33%, p < 0.01) and proteoglycans (32%, p < 0.05),
including decorin (66%, p < 0.01). In addition, the increase in sub-epithelial collagen deposition was
maintained for at least 28 days (48%, p < 0.001).
Conclusion: This animal model reproduces many of the features of airway remodelling found in
asthma and allows accurate and reproducible measurement of sub-epithelial extra-cellular matrix
deposition. As far as we are aware, this is the first demonstration of increased sub-epithelial
proteoglycan deposition in an animal model of airway remodelling. This model will be useful for
measurement of other matrix components, as well as for assessment of the molecular mechanisms
contributing to, and agents to modulate airway remodelling.

Background
Asthma is a chronic disease with increasing prevalence
characterised by persistent bronchial hyperreactivity [1].
There is evidence of epithelial cell damage, inflammatory
cell infiltration, together with hypertrophy and hyperpla￾sia of goblet cells, submucosal glands and airway smooth
muscle. Additionally, there is increased deposition of
extracellular matrix molecules including collagen types I
[2], III [3-5] and V [3,5-7], fibronectin [2], tenascin [5,8]
and the proteoglycans, lumican, biglycan, versican and
decorin [9,10] in the sub-epithelial lamina reticularis. This
leads to a 2-3-fold increase in the thickness of the lamina
reticularis [11,12] that has been correlated with increased
fibroblast/myofibroblast number [11].
The importance of increased airway extracellular matrix
deposition in the pathogenesis of asthma is uncertain.
However, increasing evidence suggests it may play a sig￾nificant role. Severity of asthma and decline in FEV1 corre￾late with sub-epithelial fibrosis [5,13,14]. Airway
hyperresponsiveness correlates with bronchial wall thick￾ening [15], sub-epithelial fibrosis [5,7,13], airway wall
proteoglycan immunoreactivity [9] and airway fibroblast
proteoglycan production [16]. In addition, mathematical
modelling suggests that thickening of the sub-epithelial
layer will result in an altered folding pattern of the airway
with fewer circumferential folds and an increased ten￾dency to airway obstruction [17]. The mechanisms
responsible for increased sub-epithelial extracellular
matrix deposition in asthma are unknown, although they
are thought to involve a complex interaction between cells
and mediators in the airway wall [18,19]. Furthermore,
the effects of current treatments on this aspect of the
pathology are equivocal [6,20-24].
Further studies are therefore required to determine the
precise mechanisms involved in the sub-epithelial deposi￾tion of extracellular matrix proteins, its importance in
relation to airway function and the effects of existing and
new therapeutic agents on the process. Mechanistic stud￾ies of airway remodelling are difficult in man. Conse￾quently, there is a need for good, reproducible animal
models of airway remodelling and techniques to assess
these parameters, preferably in mice, which would allow
study of genetically-modified strains. Increased sub-epi￾thelial deposition of collagen has been demonstrated in
mouse models [25-28], but there is little or no informa￾tion on other extra-cellular matrix proteins. The sensitivity
of mice to airway remodelling is variable [29,30] and pro￾tocols to achieve sustained airway remodelling can take
several months [28]. In addition, the methods used to
assess sub-epithelial matrix deposition are either qualita￾tive [31] or, where quantitative methods have been used,
they are often subjective, laborious [25,32], or not specific
to measurement of airway changes [33].
In this study we have used C57Bl6/SV129 mice, a strain
commonly used in the generation of genetically-modified
animals, to develop a model which exhibits many charac￾teristics of asthmatic airways and produces a rapid, repro￾ducible and persistent increase in sub-epithelial
extracellular matrix. In conjunction with this we devel￾oped accurate and sensitive histological methods using
computer-assisted image analysis to specifically quanti￾tate changes in sub-epithelial collagen and proteoglycan
deposition.
Methods
Ovalbumin sensitisation and challenge
All animal studies were undertaken with appropriate local
ethical and government regulatory approval. SV129/
C57BL/6 mice were bred at University College London
from breeding pairs obtained from the Jackson Labora￾tory, Bar Harbor, ME. Two to three month old mice were
sensitised by intra-peritoneal injection of 10 µg chicken
ovalbumin (grade V, Sigma, Poole, U.K.) in 0.1 ml normal
saline or saline alone on two occasions 10 days apart.
Twenty-one days after the second sensitisation, mice were
challenged with six daily intratracheal instillations of 400
µg ovalbumin in 50 µl normal saline or saline alone.
Briefly, mice were anaesthetised using an intra-peritoneal
injection of 0.1 ml Saffan™ anaesthetic (9 mg alfaxalone
and 3 mg alfadolone acetate/ml, Schering-Plough Animal
Health, Welwyn Garden City, U.K.). An intra-venous can￾nula (22G/25 mm, BOC Ohmeda AB, Helsingborg, Swe￾den) was introduced through the mouth into the trachea
and ovalbumin was instilled using a Hamilton syringe
passed through the lumen of the cannula. Sham chal￾lenged mice received normal saline. Mice were killed in
groups either one or twelve days after the final challenge
to assess acute airway changes and airway remodelling
respectively. Animals were injected intra-peritoneally with
0.1 ml Euthatal (200 mg pentobarbitone sodium/ml,
Rhône Mérieux Ltd., Harlow, U.K.). A longitudinal ventral
incision was made in the abdomen and the major vessels
were sectioned. Lungs were removed and either wax
embedded or frozen as described below.
Lung tissue preparation for histochemical and 
immunohistochemical staining of paraffin wax sections
Insufflation of the bronchial tree was performed using tra￾cheal instillation of 4% paraformaldehyde at 20 cm 4%
paraformaldehyde. The trachea was then ligated and the
thoracic contents were removed. Lungs were fixed in 4%
paraformaldehyde at 4°C overnight and then transferred
to 15% sucrose in PBS at 4°C overnight. They were rinsed
in 50% ethanol/H2O and stored in 70% ethanol/H2O
prior to further dehydration and processing using an auto￾mated vacuum tissue processor (Leica TP1050, Leica
Microsystems (U.K.) Ltd., Milton Keynes, U.K.). Lungs
were embedded in paraffin wax using an embedding unit

(Blockmaster III, Raymond A. Lamb, London, U.K.).
Transverse 3 µm sections were cut for histochemical stain￾ing and 5 µm sections for immunohistochemistry. After
sacrifice, care was taken to perform instillation at a con￾stant pressure of paraformaldehyde. Lungs from each
experiment were processed together in precisely the same
way and sections were cut and stained at the same time.
Automated staining was also pivotal to the uniform pro￾duction of stained sections for image analysis.
Lung tissue preparation for proteoglycan staining of frozen 
sections
Insufflation of the bronchial tree was performed using tra￾cheal instillation of a 1 : 3 mixture of OCT embedding
matrix (Cell Path plc, Newtown, U.K.) : PBS at a pressure
of 25 cm of this mixture. Due to the increased viscosity of
this mixture, compared with paraformaldehyde, a higher
pressure was required to attain the same degree of infla￾tion. The trachea was ligated and thoracic contents were
removed. Lungs were transferred to 50 ml polypropylene
tubes containing OCT embedding matrix and the tubes
were placed into a container of iso-pentane, chilled using
liquid nitrogen. Frozen sections were cut at a thickness of
7 µm, placed on polylysine-coated slides and stored at -
20°C before staining.
Histochemical staining
Paraffin wax embedded sections (3 µm) were stained with
haematoxylin and eosin to demonstrate tissue architec￾ture and inflammatory cell infiltration, and para-amino
salicylic acid/Alcian blue to demonstrate mucous cells. A
modified Martius Scarlet Blue (MSB) trichrome stain was
employed for the localisation and quantification of colla￾gen using computerised image analysis.
Immunohistochemistry
Immunohistochemistry for type III collagen and decorin
was performed on paraffin embedded sections (5 µm).
Sections were dewaxed, rehydrated and antigen retrieval
achieved by either proteinase K digestion (10 µg/ml) for
10 minutes at room temperature for type III collagen or by
microwaving sections in 10 mM citrate buffer, pH6, for 10
min for decorin. Sections were washed in PBS and endog￾enous peroxidase activity was blocked with 3% hydrogen
peroxide (Sigma, Poole, U.K.) for 30 min at RT. Sections
were then washed in PBS and incubated with 4% (v/v)
goat serum (DakoCytomation, Ely, U.K.) for 20 min at RT
to block non-specific binding sites. Excess serum was
removed by blotting and the sections were incubated with
either a 1 : 200 dilution of rabbit anti-human type III col￾lagen antibody (Chemicon, Chandlers Ford, UK) or a 1 :
80 000 dilution of Decorin antibody, LF-113 [34] (kindly
provided by Dr L.W. Fisher, National Institutes of Health,
Bethesda, MA. U.S.A.), overnight at 4°C. The sections
were washed and incubated with 0.5% (v/v) goat anti-rab￾bit biotin-labelled secondary antibody (DakoCytoma￾tion, Ely, U.K.) for 60 min at RT. Further washes in PBS
were performed before the sections were incubated with
0.5% (v/v) streptavidin (DakoCytomation, Ely, U.K.) for
30 min at RT. The streptavidin was removed by three
washes in TBS and the sections were treated with DAB for
10 min. They were then washed in tap water, counter￾stained in Mayer's haematoxylin, differentiated in acid
alcohol, dehydrated and mounted.
Proteoglycan Staining
Frozen sections (7 µm) were stained with Cupromeronic
Blue™ (Seikagaku Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) using criti￾cal electrolyte concentration (CEC) methodology [38].
Cupromeronic Blue is an intensely coloured and electron￾dense cationic dye used for the detection of sulphated
polyanions including proteoglycans [36]. Sections were
rinsed for 5 min in distilled water and placed into the
staining solution overnight. This consisted of 0.05%
Cupromeronic Blue in 25 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH
5.8) containing 2.5% glutaraldehyde and 250 mM mag￾nesium chloride. Different CEC were trialled before 250
mM of magnesium chloride was selected because it pro￾vided optimal staining. This CEC is appropriate for detec￾tion of small leucine-rich proteoglycans such as decorin
(J.E. Scott, personal communication). The next day slides
were washed in 0.025 M sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.8)
containing 250 mM magnesium chloride. They were
dehydrated to xylene and coverslips were applied.
Measurement of airway sub-epithelial matrix components 
using image analysis
Sections were examined by light microscopy using a x10
objective. Airways were selected using the following pre￾defined criteria. Suitable airways were: complete, of an
appropriate size to be contained within a high power
field, not attached to other airways and cut in a plane per￾pendicular to their length (the minimum internal diame￾ter : maximum internal diameter ratio was more than 0.5
in all cases). All suitable airways in each section were ana￾lysed. Images were digitised using a digital video camera
(JVC KY-F55B, Imaging Associates, Thame, U.K.) with a
resolution of 768 × 576 (vertical × horizontal) pixels.
Pixel size was converted into micrometers and image anal￾ysis was performed using image analysis software (Zeiss
KS300 Release 3.0, Imaging Associates, Thame, U.K.).
Thresholding using pre-defined RGB criteria for airspace
was performed. This allowed lumen airspace to be differ￾entiated from airway wall. Airway lumen perimeter was
then measured for each suitable airway. Thresholding
using predefined RGB criteria for extra-cellular matrix
constituents was performed. This produces a superim￾posed digitised image of both airway and parenchymal
matrix. Next, a 'scrapping' procedure was completed in
which pixels not adjoining at least ten other pixels were

deleted. This provided better definition of airway matrix
as links between airway and parenchymal matrix were
removed. In this way, lumen perimeter and matrix values
were obtained for each airway. Results were expressed as
area of sub-epithelial matrix/unit airway perimeter (µm2/
µm).
Statistical analysis
Data are presented as means ± SEM. Statistical evaluations
were performed using ANOVA or unpaired t-tests for sin￾gle group comparisons. A p-value of less than 0.05 was
considered significant.
Results
Many of the histological changes associated with airway
remodelling in asthma are reproduced in this murine
model following ovalbumin sensitisation and intra-tra￾cheal challenge. Characteristic differences were seen one
and twelve days after final challenge.
Histological changes seen 24 hours after the final 
challenge
Airway changes on the day after the final challenge are
shown in figure 1. H&E-stained sections from saline sen￾sitised/saline challenged mice demonstrated that the epi￾thelial layer was generally intact and epithelial cells
appeared regular in shape (figure 1A). Inflammatory cell
infiltration of the airway wall was absent. Very occasional
mucus-secreting goblet cells were demonstrated using
PAS/Alcian Blue staining (figure 1E). Lung sections from
saline sensitised/ovalbumin challenged and ovalbumin
sensitised/saline challenged mice were not distinguisha￾ble from those of saline sensitised/challenged mice (data
not shown). H&E staining of sections from ovalbumin
sensitised/challenged mice revealed widespread disrup￾tion of the epithelial layer (figure 1B). Epithelial cells were
irregular in shape, some were pyknotic and some were
shed into the airway lumen. A large number of mucus￾secreting goblet cells were demonstrated using PAS/Alcian
Blue staining (figure 1F). Airway walls were infiltrated
with inflammatory cells that were predominantly eosi￾nophilic but also included neutrophils, lymphocytes and
macrophages (figure 1B). Margination and diapedesis of
inflammatory cells was seen in adjacent blood vessels (fig￾ure 1B). Inflammatory cell infiltration was restricted to
the bronchial and peribronchial regions. The lung paren￾chyma appeared to be unaffected by ovalbumin sensitisa￾tion and challenge, and was histologically similar to
control sections (figure 1C, D).
Histological changes seen 12 days after the final challenge
Epithelial changes
Inflammatory changes were no longer apparent in ovalbu￾min sensitised/challenged airways and were not seen in
any of the control groups (figure 2). The epithelial layer
was generally intact and epithelial cells appeared regular
in shape. Very occasional mucus-secreting goblet cells
were demonstrated using PAS/Alcian Blue staining (data
not shown). All three control groups had similar appear￾ances (figure 2A and 2C).
Increased sub-epithelial collagen deposition
In control sections, MSB staining showed a diffuse band
of blue-stained collagen surrounding the airways beneath
the epithelial layer (figure 2A2B2C). In smaller airways
the band of collagen sometimes appeared discontinuous.
However, in the airways of ovalbumin sensitised and chal￾lenged mice, the staining appeared more intense, the
band of staining was thickened compared with controls
and usually appeared continuous around all sizes of air￾way (compare figure 2D with figures 2A2B2C). Quantita￾tive image analysis showed there were no significant
differences in the area of sub-epithelial collagen staining
between the control groups (figure 3A). Values for control
groups were 6.31 ± 0.32 µm2/µm for saline sensitised/
challenged mice, 5.63 ± 0.27 µm2/µm for saline sensi￾tised/ovalbumin challenged mice and 5.65 ± 0.26 µm2/
µm for ovalbumin sensitised/saline challenged mice.
Ovalbumin sensitisation and challenge produced a signif￾icant increase in sub-epithelial collagen/unit lumen
perimeter compared with control groups (7.77 ± 0.37
µm2/µm, p < 0.01). Compared with the mean of the con￾trols, there was a 33% increase in sub-epithelial collagen
in ovalbumin sensitised/challenged animals (p < 0.01).
In these studies the area of sub-epithelial collagen staining
was expressed with respect to length of airway lumen
perimeter. Therefore differences could reflect changes in
lumen perimeter as well as collagen deposition. However,
we found no significant difference in lumen perimeter
between control groups (991 ± 40 µm) and the ovalbu￾min sensitised/ovalbumin challenged group (1066 ± 55
µm) indicating that the changes observed were directly
attributable to an increase in sub-epithelial collagen
deposition.
To determine whether ovalbumin sensitisation and chal￾lenge had a differential effect on sub-epithelial collagen
depending on airway size, airway data were sub-divided
into lumen perimeters of greater or less than 1000 µm
(figure 3B). In airways with lumen perimeters greater than
1000 µm, values for control groups were 5.84 ± 0.42 µm2/
µm for saline sensitised/challenged mice, 7.00 ± 0.61
µm2/µm for saline sensitised/ovalbumin challenged mice
and 6.36 ± 0.48 µm2/µm for ovalbumin sensitised/saline
challenged mice. There were no significant differences
between these groups. Sub-epithelial collagen/unit lumen
perimeter was 9.73 ± 0.73 µm2/µm in ovalbumin sensi￾tised/challenged mice, representing a 53% increase in col￾lagen compared with the mean of the controls (p < 0.01).

Ovalbumin sensitisation and challenge did not appear to
increase the area of sub-epithelial collagen compared with
saline sensitisation and challenge in airways with a lumen
perimeter less than 1000 µm. Values for control groups
were 6.63 ± 0.55 µm2/µm for saline sensitised/challenged
mice (number of airways analysed, n = 43), 5.03 ± 0.25
µm2/µm for saline sensitised/ovalbumin challenged mice
(n = 66) and 5.19 ± 0.31 µm2/µm for ovalbumin sensi￾tised/saline challenged mice (n = 50). Sub-epithelial col￾lagen/unit lumen perimeter was 6.58 ± 0.40 µm2/µm in
ovalbumin sensitised/challenged mice (n = 88).
In a further experiment sub-epithelial collagen was meas￾ured 28 days after final challenge in order to assess
whether the increase in collagen persisted over time.
Saline sensitised/saline challenged mice were compared
with ovalbumin sensitised/ovalbumin challenged mice.
Only one control group was used as no significant differ￾ences had been shown between control groups in the pre￾vious experiment. Sub-epithelial collagen/unit lumen
perimeter was 3.69 ± 0.22 µm2/µm in saline sensitised/
saline challenged mice and 5.46 ± 0.42 µm2/µm in oval￾bumin sensitised/challenged mice, a 48% increase in

collagen (p < 0.001). In airways with lumen perimeters
greater than 1000 µm, values for saline sensitised/chal￾lenged mice were 4.43 ± 0.35 µm2/µm (n = 34) and 6.92
± 0.79 µm2/µm (n = 21) in ovalbumin sensitised/chal￾lenged mice, corresponding to a 56% increase in collagen
(p < 0.002) and similar to that observed at 12 days. In
contrast to the 12-day data, in airways with lumen perim￾eters less than 1000 µm, values for saline sensitised/chal￾lenged mice were 2.88 ± 0.16 µm2/µm (n = 31) and 4.58
± 0.43 µm2/µm (n = 35) in ovalbuminsensitised/chal￾lenged mice, corresponding to a 59% increase in collagen
(p < 0.001). The increase in sub-epithelial collagen is
therefore maintained for at least four weeks.
Sections from two groups at 12 days were compared using
the same techniques by an independent observer. Sub￾epithelial collagen/unit lumen perimeter was 4.16 ± 0.21
µm2/µm in saline sensitised/saline challenged mice and
5.65 ± 0.24 µm2/µm in ovalbumin sensitised/challenged
mice. This represents an increase of 36% (p < 0.001) and
is of a similar magnitude to that obtained by the first
observer.
To confirm that the changes in MSB staining reflected
changes in sub-epithelial collagen deposition we immu￾nostained sections for type III collagen and quantified the
area of sub-epithelial staining. Type III collagen showed a
similar localisation pattern to that of the blue staining of
MSB (figure 4). The area of sub-epithelial type III collagen
staining in saline sensitised/saline challenged mice was
2.26 ± 0.14 µm2/µm (n = 8) and 2.92 ± 0.16 µm2/µm (n
= 11) in ovalbumin sensitised/challenged mice (p < 0.01).
This increase of approximately 30% was similar to the
increase observed in sections from the same groups
stained with MSB.
Increased sub-epithelial proteoglycan deposition
Cupromeronic Blue staining demonstrated a reticular pat￾tern of proteoglycan deposition beneath the epithelial
layer (figure 5A). Staining was usually continuous around
the airway circumference and was also seen in the lung
parenchyma to a lesser degree. Increased staining was seen
in ovalbumin sensitised/ovalbumin challenged mice
compared with controls (figure 5A and 5B). Sub-epithelial
proteoglycan/unit lumen perimeter was 4.13 ± 0.44 µm2/
µm in control mice and 5.46 ± 0.39 µm2/µm in ovalbu￾min sensitised/challenged mice, corresponding to a 32%
increase in proteoglycans (p < 0.05) (figure 6).
Increased sub-epithelial decorin deposition
In control airways staining for decorin was weak with
stronger staining associated with blood vessels (figure
5C). In contrast, in the airways of ovalbumin sensitised/
challenged mice decorin immunohistochemistry demon￾strated a well-localised, intense band of staining beneath
the epithelium (figure 5D). Immunostaining was not seen
elsewhere in lung sections. Sub-epithelial decorin/unit
lumen perimeter was 1.66 ± 0.27 µm2/µm in control mice

decorin in ovalbumin sensitised/challenged mice (p <
0.01) (figure 6).
Discussion
Using a modified ovalbumin sensitisation/challenge pro￾tocol in a mouse strain often used for the generation of
transgenics and knockouts, many of the features of airway
remodelling have been reproduced. At 24 hours after final
challenge, epithelial changes similar to those found in
acute asthma are seen. There is epithelial cell loss, mucous
cell metaplasia and inflammatory cell infiltration of the
airway wall. This model, in contrast to several others pub￾lished in the literature, has the advantage of not produc￾ing any obvious parenchymal changes. 12 days after final
challenge, the acute inflammatory changes have largely
resolved and increased deposition of sub-epithelial colla￾gen and proteoglycans, including decorin, are
demonstrated.
The current protocol is based on the widely used ovalbu￾min sensitisation and challenge method [25,26,37,38]
using two intra-peritoneal sensitising injections and six
daily intra-tracheal challenges of ovalbumin. The doses of
ovalbumin for sensitisation and challenge fall within the
ranges used in previous studies but the timings have been
optimised to produce reproducible airway remodelling
with increased and persistent deposition of extra-cellular
matrix proteins including collagens and proteoglycans.
Challenges were given by direct intra-tracheal instillation
rather than by aerosol as this may more accurately control
the dose of ovalbumin received by each mouse. Intra-tra￾cheal instillation rather than aerosol inhalation may also
have contributed to the reduction in parenchymal effects
seen in this study.
We found similar increases in collagen deposition 12 and
28 days after final challenge when we analysed all airways
together. However, when airways were sub-divided into
groups with lumen perimeters of greater or less than 1000
µm the difference remained significant for larger airways
at both time points but was only significant in smaller air￾ways at the later time. A similar study in rats also found
significant changes in smaller airways only at later times
[39]. The reason for this is unclear but could be due to
remodelling occurring more slowly in smaller airways,
although further studies would be required to confirm
this. The studies of Palmans and co-workers in rats catego￾rised airway size according to basement membrane length
and divided airways into groups with basement mem￾brane length ≤1000 µm, >1000 µm and ≤2000 µm, and
>2000 µm. In the present study with mice, airway size was
based on the lumen perimeter as this could be measured
more accurately with the stains used. Both basement
membrane length and lumen perimeter measurements
have previously been validated as markers of airway size
that are independent of lung volume [40]. In our study

very few airways had a perimeter of greater than 2000 µm.
Therefore, airways were grouped as ≤1000 µm or >1000
µm.
The number of challenges varies dramatically between dif￾ferent published protocols used to induce airway remod￾elling. Two opposing theoretical considerations exist. In
favour of a greater number of challenges is the, essentially
intuitive, belief that remodelling only results from
chronic, repetitive injury and repair [26,39]. In favour of
fewer challenges is the risk of immunological tolerance
developing as more challenges are given. This is not just a
hypothetical risk as it has been demonstrated that pro￾longed exposure of mice to intra-nasal or aerosolised
ovalbumin results in peripheral CD4(+) T-cell unrespon￾siveness, reduced ovalbumin-specific IgE production and
suppression of airway inflammation [41,42]. We there￾fore used the minimum number of challenges that
produced a significant and reproducible increase in sub￾epithelial matrix.

Allergic airways disease is generally thought of as a Th2
driven response and most previous models of ovalbumin
induced airway remodelling in mice have been developed
in the BALB/c strain which has a strong Th2 response. The
C57BL/6 and SV129 background strains do not generally
exhibit strong Th2 responses [43] and may therefore not
be ideal in some respects. However, the C57BL/6 strain
has previously been used in studies of ovalbumin-induced
airway remodelling [44] and the SV129 strain exhibits
similar fibroproliferative responses to those of C57BL/6 in
other models of fibrogenesis. Whilst we have not assessed
the Th1/Th2 balance in the current studies, the fact that
significantly increased and sustained deposition of sub￾epithelial extracellular matrix proteins was observed, sug￾gests that a strong Th2 response may not be critical to the
development of airway remodelling. Further studies
would be required to confirm this.
The sensitivity of different mouse strains is a considerable
problem when modelling the various pathologic features
of asthma including airway remodelling [29,30]. This has
lead to the development of a multitude of ovalbumin sen￾sitisation and challenge protocols in order to optimise the
modelling of particular features of asthma in different
mouse strains. The protocol developed in this study has
used mixed strain mice, which are commonly used in the
generation of genetically engineered mice and is commer￾cially available. Ideally, genetically engineered mice
should be backcrossed to a pure strain. However, due to
constraints of time and cost, this is often not achieved. We
therefore believe the model described here is readily
reproducible and will be useful for studies utilising genet￾ically engineered mice to investigate mechanisms
involved in airway remodelling.
An important feature of this study is the use of digital
image analysis for the quantification of sub-epithelial
extra-cellular matrix deposition. Previous studies in mice
have used a variety of histological methods including pro￾jection of airway images onto grids and point-counting
[25], measurement of airway wall thickness with a micro￾scope eyepiece reticle [32]and measurement of immunos￾taining intensity from black and white photomicrographs
[31]. Other studies have attempted to quantitate airway
extra-cellular matrix deposition using different tech￾niques. These include measurement of hydroxyproline in
whole lung [30,33] or in micro-dissected airways [45],
and measurement of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF)
cellular fibronectin content [37]. Significant disadvan￾tages exist with each of these methods. Measurements
derived from whole lung or BALF cannot be airway spe￾cific and this problem will be exacerbated in models that
induce significant parenchymal changes. Accurate micro￾dissection of airways as small as those found in the mouse
is extremely difficult, particularly when we are concerned
with a layer as thin and variable as the lamina reticularis.
Computerised image analysis of stained sections has a
number of advantages. It is reproducible between observ￾ers and allows accurate determination of extra-cellular
matrix in the sub-epithelial layer of each airway. Anatom￾ically, murine airways are frequently associated with other
lial total proteoglycans and decorin Figure 6 The effect of ovalbumin sensitisation/challenge on sub-epithe￾The effect of ovalbumin sensitisation/challenge on

airways and blood vessels. Use of computerised image
analysis allows individual airways to be isolated from sur￾rounding structures. This facilitates selection of airway
from non-airway matrix. The technique is also highly
adaptable, allowing use of different stains to quantify dif￾ferent extra-cellular matrices.
The increase in sub-epithelial collagen in ovalbumin sen￾sitised/challenged mice that we found using six consecu￾tive challenges over six days is similar to that observed in
other acute [25] and more chronic (3–12 weeks)
[26,28,30,33] ovalbumin challenge studies. For example
Blyth and co-workers observed a 55% increase in sub-epi￾thelial reticulin staining after 6 ovalbumin challenges,
three days apart, which was maintained for 50 days [25].
Similarly, Temelkovski and co-workers described a 55%
increase in the thickness of the sub-epithelial layer after
three ovalbumin challenges/week for 4 weeks, with fur￾ther increases if challenges were continued for up to 8
weeks [26]. Furthermore, these changes are of a similar
order of magnitude to those observed in the airways of
asthmatics.
To further confirm that the sub-epithelial area of blue
staining measured from MSB stained sections truly
reflected an increase in collagen deposition we also
immunostained sections for type III collagen. The per￾centage increases in the area of staining obtained for type
III collagen and MSB staining following ovalbumin sensi￾tisation/challenge were very similar. However, the values
for type III collagen were about one third of those
obtained from the MSB sections. This most likely reflects
the difference between staining specifically for type III col￾lagen and MSB, which is thought to stain all fibrillar col￾lagens. Types I and III collagens represent greater than
95% of total lung collagen with type III collagen contrib￾uting approximately 30% of this total [46]. The propor￾tional area of staining for type III collagen compared with
the total blue MSB stained area is therefore consistent
with the distribution of collagen types in the lung.
Previous studies examining increased sub-epithelial extra￾cellular matrix deposition in murine models of airway
remodelling have measured changes in collagen
[28,32,45,48] and BAL cellular fibronectin [37,49]. Simi￾larly, airway collagen and fibronectin have been measured
in a rat model [39]. A unique feature of this study, there￾fore, is its application to measurement of increased sub￾epithelial proteoglycans, including decorin.
The proteoglycans lumican, biglycan, versican, hyaluro￾nan and decorin have been identified in biopsy studies of
normal and asthmatic human airways. Lumican, biglycan,
and versican immunostaining is predominantly found in
the sub-epithelial layer of control airways [10]. Versican
and hyaluronan are also localised around and internal to
airway smooth muscle bundles [50]. Data on decorin
immunostaining in controls are conflicting. Minimal air￾way decorin was demonstrated in one study [10], whereas
extensive sub-epithelial staining was apparent in another
[51]. In this study we show a similar sub-epithelial locali￾sation of proteoglycan staining in mouse airways. We also
show that decorin is localised to airway sub-epithelial
extra-cellular matrix in mice as described previously for
human [51], bovine [52] and rat [53] airways, and is
increased following ovalbumin sensitisation and chal￾lenge. Since this part of the study used only saline
sensitised/saline challenged animals as a control we can￾not exclude the possibility that increased proteoglycan
deposition is due to non-specific effects of instilling large
amounts of ovalbumin into the airways. However, this
seems unlikely given the demonstrated lack of effect of
ovalbumin on collagen deposition in the saline sensi￾tised/ovalbumin challenged mice (figures 2 and 3) and
the evidence for increased sub-epithelial proteoglycan
deposition in asthmatic airways.
Lumican, biglycan and versican are increased in the sub￾epithelial layer of asthmatic airways compared with con￾trols [10,24]. In our study, Cupromeronic Blue staining of
proteoglycans was increased in ovalbumin sensitised/
challenged mice with a similar sub-epithelial localisation
to that observed in asthmatic airways, suggesting this is a
good model of the changes observed in humans [51].
The finding of increased proteoglycans in the sub-epithe￾lial layer of the airways of asthmatics and ovalbumin sen￾sitised/challenged mice is of particular interest.
Proteoglycans have an important role in determining
organisation of collagen [54]. Decorin, particularly, is an
important regulator of collagen fibril assembly [55,56].
Proteoglycans bind growth factors relevant to extra-cellu￾lar matrix deposition in the sub-epithelial layer. Perlecan
binds specifically to fibroblast growth factor-7 [57]. A
number of proteoglycans bind transforming growth fac￾tor-β, including decorin, biglycan and fibromodulin [58].
The increased immunostaining for decorin observed in
ovalbumin sensitised/challenged mice is consistent with
its sub-epithelial co-localisation with increased extra-cel￾lular matrix, and TGF-β which has previously been shown
to be increased [28]. The increase in sub-epithelial
proteoglycans may be an important factor in the develop￾ment of sub-epithelial airway remodelling.
Conclusion
This animal model reproduces many of the features of air￾way remodelling found in asthma and allows accurate
and reproducible measurement of sub-epithelial extra-cel￾lular matrix deposition. As far as we are aware this is the
first demonstration of increased sub-epithelial proteogly-

cans in an animal model of airway remodelling.
Proteoglycans and collagen are increased by a similar
magnitude to that demonstrated in asthmatics, providing
a useful model of this aspect of the pathology. The prop￾erties of these matrix components suggest that they will
have direct and indirect effects on airway function and the
regulation of airway remodelling. The model will be
invaluable in the assessment of the molecular mecha￾nisms contributing to sub-epithelial airway remodelling
and of agents to modulate such remodelling.
