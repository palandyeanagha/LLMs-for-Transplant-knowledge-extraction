Nephrotic syndrome (NS) is divided into steroid-sensitive (SSNS) and -resistant (SRNS) variants. SRNS causes 
end-stage kidney disease, which cannot be cured. While the disease mechanisms of NS are not well under￾stood, genetic mapping studies suggest a multitude of unknown single-gene causes. We combined homozy￾gosity mapping with whole-exome resequencing and identified an ARHGDIA mutation that causes SRNS. We 
demonstrated that ARHGDIA is in a complex with RHO GTPases and is prominently expressed in podocytes 
of rat glomeruli. ARHGDIA mutations (R120X and G173V) from individuals with SRNS abrogated interaction 
with RHO GTPases and increased active GTP-bound RAC1 and CDC42, but not RHOA, indicating that RAC1 
and CDC42 are more relevant to the pathogenesis of this SRNS variant than RHOA. Moreover, the mutations 
enhanced migration of cultured human podocytes; however, enhanced migration was reversed by treatment 
with RAC1 inhibitors. The nephrotic phenotype was recapitulated in arhgdia-deficient zebrafish. RAC1 inhib￾itors were partially effective in ameliorating arhgdia-associated defects. These findings identify a single-gene 
cause of NS and reveal that RHO GTPase signaling is a pathogenic mediator of SRNS.

Introduction
Nephrotic syndrome (NS) is caused by malfunction of the kidney 
glomerular filter, resulting in proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, and 
edema. NS is classified by its response to steroid treatment into 
steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome (SSNS) and steroid-resistant 
nephrotic syndrome (SRNS) categories. SSNS represents one of 
the most frequent kidney diseases and constitutes 80% of all child￾hood NS. Histologically, it presents as minimal change nephrotic 
syndrome (MCNS). Very little is known about its primary causes, 
disease processes, or mechanisms of treatment. SRNS is mostly 
refractory to therapy and leads to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) 
within a few years of onset, requiring renal replacement therapy 
for survival. It causes about 15% of all ESKD in children (1), is 
considered one of the most intractable kidney diseases, and has a 
30% recurrence risk in renal transplants, leading again to ESKD. 
Histologically, SRNS presents as focal segmental glomeruloscle￾rosis (FSGS) or as the early-onset developmental variant, diffuse 
mesangial sclerosis (DMS) (2). There is clinical overlap between 
SSNS and SRNS, as some individuals with SSNS and MCNS may 
later develop SRNS with FSGS histology.
The discovery of single-gene causes of SRNS has generated the 
first insights into its pathogenesis by revealing that the defective 
proteins are essential for glomerular podocyte function (3). Podo￾cytes constitute the outer epithelial layer of the 3-layered capillar￾ies in the glomerular filter, which also consists of the glomerular 
basement membrane (GBM) and the endothelial cell (EC) layer (4). 
Podocytes are neuron-like cells that extend multiple tubulin-based 
primary processes, which branch off actin-based foot processes. 
The foot processes interdigitate with those of neighboring podo￾cytes and form between them the glomerular slit diaphragm, 
which is critical for the filtering process and the retention of pro-

tein in the bloodstream. Integrin molecules in the “sole plate” of 
the foot processes tether the foot processes to the GBM. Loss of 
foot processes and slit membrane integrity causes glomerular pro￾tein leakage and NS. The products of single-gene causes of SRNS 
play a role in cell-cell signaling at the podocyte slit membrane 
(NPHS1, NPHS2, CD2AP, PTPRO/GLEPP1) (5–8) for regulation 
of the foot process actin network (ACTN4 and INF2) (9, 10) or in 
foot process-GBM interaction (LAMB2 and ITGA3) (11–14).
While the disease mechanisms of NS are still obscure, features of 
podocyte cell migration were recently implicated in its pathogenesis. 
In this concept, a sessile podocyte phenotype represents the physi￾ologic mode, whereas a migratory phenotype represents the neph￾rotic mode (15). Actin remodeling by members of the RHO family 
of small GTPases (referred to hereafter as RHO GTPases) regulates 
the 2 modes, where active RHOA and increased actin remodeling 
are seen in the nephrotic state (16). Conversely, inactivation of RHO 
GTPases may cause proteinuria in animal models, e.g., in Cdc42–/–
mice (17) as well as in transgenic mice that express a dominant-neg￾ative Rhoa mutant (18). Apparently, both increased and decreased 
RHO GTPase signaling interfere with the state of podocyte mobility, 
thus causing proteinuria (19). Furthermore, mutations in the non￾muscle class I myosin MYO1E cause proteinuria in humans due to 
decreased podocyte migratory ability (20).
Many of the genes that cause NS, if mutated, act in a reces￾sive mode (e.g., NPHS1, NPHS2, and PLCE1) (5, 6, 21). Because 
recessive single-gene mutations directly represent the primary 
cause of a genetic disease, gene identification offers a powerful 
approach toward revealing disease mechanisms. Since recessive 
mutations predominantly convey loss of function, recessive sin￾gle-gene defects can be directly transferred into animal models 
to study the related disease mechanisms and to screen for small 
molecules as possible treatment modalities. However, no caus￾Figure 1

ative gene is known for SSNS. Likewise, in more than 80% of all 
cases of SRNS, the molecular cause is unknown, and treatment 
options have yet to be discovered (22).
Although the onset of SRNS in the first year of life is mostly a 
single-gene disorder, i.e., more than two-thirds of cases are caused 
by a mutation in 1 of only 5 different disease genes (NPHS1, 
NPHS2, WT1, LAMB2, or PLCE) (21, 23), genetic mapping data 
strongly suggest that there are a multitude of additional disease 
genes that cause SRNS later in life (24). The finding that some 
of the more recently identified recessive genetic causes of NS are 
exceedingly rare (LAMB2, refs. 12, 25; PLCE1, ref. 21; and COQ6, 
ref. 26) necessitates the ability to identify novel single-gene causes 
of NS in families with only a single affected individual. The new 
method of whole-exome resequencing (WER) theoretically offers 
a powerful approach to identifying genes in rare recessive diseases. 
However, its utility is hampered by the large number of genetic vari￾ants that are observed with WER in any given individual (27, 28). 
To overcome this limitation, we developed a strategy that a pri￾ori restricts the number of variants by combining WER (28) with 
homozygosity mapping (24). We applied this approach to fam￾ilies affected by SRNS or SSNS and identified a novel recessive, 
full-penetrance cause of SRNS. We generated direct evidence in 
humans that loss of function of ARHGDIA causes NS by interfer￾ence with RHO GTPase signaling, thereby altering the podocyte 
migratory state. We recapitulated features of NS in a zebrafish 
model and demonstrated that RAC1 inhibitors mitigate the NS 
phenotypes. Our findings may have implications for the develop￾ment of new therapeutic approaches to NS.
Results
Mutations in ARHGDIA cause NS. We performed homozygosity map￾ping (HM) in a family (A1432) of Ashkenazi Jewish origin in whom 
2 siblings had early-onset SRNS with renal histology of DMS. HM 
yielded 5 regions of homozygosity by descent as candidate regions 
for a recessive SRNS gene (Figure 1A) (24). Using WER, we detected 
in both siblings a homozygous missense mutation (c.518G>T;p.
G173V) of ARHGDIA (RefSeq accession number NM_001185077.1) 
encoding the RHO GDP dissociation inhibitor α (Figure 1B and 
Table 1). The altered amino acid residue is conserved, including 
S. cerevisiae. When we examined 65 additional individuals with 
DMS and 350 individuals with SRNS, we detected a homozy￾gous mutation (c.358C>T;p.R120X) in an infant (A4578-21) 
with congenital NS (Figure 1B and Table 1). This infant also exhib￾ited renal histology of DMS (Figure 1C and Table 1). Both muta￾tions were absent from more than 190 ethnically matched healthy 
control individuals and from more than 8,600 European controls 
in the Exome Variant Server (EVS) (http://evs.gs.washington.edu/
EVS/). The primary cellular function of ARHGDIA is to interact 
with RHO GTPases, including RHOA, RAC1, and CDC42, locking 
them into their cytosolic, inactive, GDP-bound states (29). Thus, 
ARHGDIA indirectly regulates actin cytoskeleton–dependent cel￾lular functions. Depletion of Arhgdia was shown to cause early-on￾set NS in mice (30).
Arhgdia localizes to podocytes in glomeruli. Because most gene prod￾ucts that are defective in SRNS are located in glomerular podo￾cytes, we examined adult rat kidney sections and found subcellu￾lar localization of ARHGDIA. Indeed, ARHGDIA is enriched in 
both differentiated and undifferentiated human podocytes (Sup￾plemental Figure 1; supplemental material available online with 
this article; doi:10.1172/JCI69134DS1). In glomeruli, ARHGDIA 
is prominently expressed in podocytes as identified by the expres￾sion of nuclear WT1 (Figure 2A). ARHGDIA partially colocalized 
with synaptopodin, which colocalizes with ARHGAP24 (31) and 
regulates RHOA signaling (Figure 2A) (32). ARHGDIA appeared 
to localize to the nucleus in some podocytes, and nuclear localiza￾tion of ARHGDIA has been previously reported (33). ARHGDIA 
also colocalized with the phospholipase C ε 1 (PLCε1) protein, 
which is defective in SRNS type 3 (21). ARHGDIA partially colo￾Table 1

calized with PLCε1 to podocyte cell bodies and primary processes 
(Figure 2B), suggesting a defect in podocyte function as central to 
the pathogenesis of ARHGDIA mutations.
Since ARHGDIA is a regulator of RHO GTPases (29), we examined 
its colocalization with the RHO GTPases RHOA, RAC1, and CDC42. 
RHOA, RAC1, and CDC42 exhibited broad glomerular staining 
in podocyte cell bodies and processes (Figure 2C). ARHGDIA 
partially colocalized with RHOA, RAC1, and CDC42 in proximal 
cell bodies and primary processes. Our findings are congruent 
with the proposed regulatory role of RHO GTPases in these podo￾cyte structures (15, 19).
ARHGDIA and RHO small GTPases form a complex, and mutations 
abrogate interaction. To further elucidate the role of ARHGDIA in the 
functioning of the RHO small GTPases RAC1, CDC42, and RHOA 
in podocytes, we performed coimmunoprecipitation experiments 
of ARHGDIA in rat renal glomerular lysates as an endogenous, 
disease-relevant source of podocyte proteins. We demonstrate 
that an anti-ARHGDIA antibody coimmunoprecipitated with all 
3 RHO small GTPases, RHOA, RAC1, and CDC42 (Figure 2D), 
strongly suggesting that the pathogenesis of ARHGDIA defects is 
related to RHO small GTPase function.
We then performed coimmunoprecipitation studies in cul￾tured human podocytes to examine whether the 2 ARHGDIA
mutants, which we identified in the family with SRNS, affect 
protein-protein interaction. Overexpression of the ARHGDIA 
mutants (R120X and G173V) abrogated interaction with endoge￾nous RHOA, RAC1, and CDC42. (Figure 3A and Supplemental 
Figure 2A). Comparable results were seen upon a GST pulldown 
assay in rat renal glomerular lysates (Supplemental Figure 2B).
ARHGDIA mutations cause increased levels of active RAC1 and CDC42 
and fail to regulate the podocyte migratory phenotype. As ARHGDIA is 
known to regulate the inactive GDP-bound versus the active GTP￾bound states of RHO GTPases (29), we examined the effect of 
ARHGDIA mutations on the active states of RHO GTPases. We 
used purified PAK1 to assay the active GTP-bound states of RAC1 
and CDC42 (Figure 3B) and used rhotekin to assay the active 
state of RHOA (Figure 3C). As expected, wild-type ARHGDIA, 
when overexpressed in cultured human podocytes, decreased the 
GTP-bound forms of RAC1, CDC42, and RHOA. In contrast, over￾expression of the truncating ARHGDIA mutant (R120X) failed 
to decrease the active states of RAC1 and CDC42, and the mis￾sense mutant (G173V) only weakly decreased their active states

were coimmunoprecipitated with endogenous RHO GTPases. Note that the R120X and G173V mutants abrogated interaction with RHOA, RAC1, and 
CDC42. (B) Active GTP-bound forms of RAC1 and CDC42 precipitated from podocytes expressing FLAG-ARHGDIA (wild-type and mutants) using 
a GST-PAK1 (CRIB, CDC42, and RAC interactive binding domain) pulldown assay. Five percent input represents the controls for equal loading. Note 
that, compared with mock cells, podocytes expressing ARHGDIA-WT exhibited a substantial decrease in active RAC1 and CDC42. This decrease 
was abrogated in the null mutant R120X and is diminished in the G173V mutant. (C) Active GTP-bound RHOA precipitated from podocytes expressing 
FLAG-ARHGDIA (wild-type and mutants) using a GST-rhotekin (RHO-binding domain [RBD]) pulldown assay. Overexpression of either wild-type or 
mutant ARHGDIA resulted in a substantial decrease in relative RHOA activity compared with mock cells. PD, pulldown. All IPs and PDs are represen￾tative of more than 3 experiments. (D) Effect on podocyte migration of wild-type ARHGDIA and 2 mutants found in patients with SRNS. Migration assay 
was performed using the xCELLigence system (described in Methods). Overexpression of wild-type ARHGDIA in podocytes inhibited serum-induced 
migration (green). However, the mutants G173V and R120X failed to inhibit migration (red). Error bars are shown in one direction only for clarity and 
indicate SDs for more than 3 independent experiments (see also Supplemental Figure 5).

(Figure 3B). In contrast, both mutants decreased the active state of 
RHOA (Figure 3C). This indicates that signals relayed by RAC1 and 
CDC42 may be more relevant to the pathogenesis of this form of 
SRNS than signals relayed by RHOA. In addition, we demonstrated 
by GST pulldown that active RAC1 is spontaneously elevated in 
EBV-transformed lymphoblasts from patient A1432-21 with an 
ARHGDIA mutation when compared with the healthy control 
individual (A2238-26), while the heterozygous father (A4578-11) 
of an individual with an ARHGDIA mutation (A4578-21) 
showed intermediate elevation (Supplemental Figure 3).
We then examined the effect of ARHGDIA on podocyte migra￾tion using the xCELLigence system (Roche Applied Science), 
which monitors cell migration in real time. We found that the 
increase in podocyte migration, which is induced by the addition 
of serum, was reduced when wild-type ARHGDIA was transfected 
into cultured human podocytes (Figure 3D). In contrast, the 2 
ARHGDIA mutants detected in SRNS families A1432 and A4578 
failed to reduce the migratory podocyte phenotype (Figure 2D). In 
summary, both ARHGDIA mutations from individuals with SRNS 
abrogated interaction with RHO GTPases and failed to regulate 
active GTP-bound RAC1 and CDC42, but not RHOA, indicat￾ing that RAC1 and CDC42 are more relevant than RHOA to the 
pathogenesis of this SRNS variant. The mutations resulted in a 
failure to regulate the migratory phenotype of cultured human 
podocytes (Supplemental Figure 4).
ARHGDIA knockdown in cultured podocytes causes an increased migra￾tory phenotype, which was reversed by RAC1 inhibitors. To test whether 
the effects of an ARHGDIA mutant in podocytes result from loss 
of function of ARHGDIA, we performed knockdown of ARHGDIA 
in cultured human podocytes. The GST pulldown for active RAC1, 
CDC42, and RHOA yielded results consistent with the notion that 
ARHGDIA loss of function increases the active states of RAC1 and 
CDC42 by 168% and 185%, respectively, but has no such effect on 
RHOA (Figure 4, A–E, and Supplement Figures 5 and 6).
Because RAC1 inhibitors were shown to improve the NS phe￾notype of Arhgdia–/– mice (34), we tested the effect of the 2 RAC1 
inhibitors using the xCELLigence system. We found that knock￾down of ARHGDIA caused an enhanced migratory phenotype 
of cultured human podocytes (Figure 4F, Supplemental Figure 
6C, and Supplemental Figure 7A), which was reversed by over￾expression of siRNA-resistant ARHGDIA (Supplemental Figure 
6C and Supplemental Figure 7). Interestingly, the addition to 
podocyte cultures of either one of the RAC1 inhibitors reversed 
the migratory phenotype, confirming that the activated state of 
RAC1 induced by loss of ARHGDIA function mediates the migra￾tory phenotype of cultured human podocytes and is central to the 
pathogenesis of SRNS due to ARHGDIA mutations. The findings 
suggest that RAC1 inhibitors are potentially useful therapeutics in 
humans with ARHGDIA loss of function.
Our findings are consistent with the concept that activation of 
RHO GTPases through the regulation of actin (15, 19, 35) converts 
the sessile cultured human podocyte phenotype into a migratory 
one, which interferes with glomerular slit membrane integrity, thus 
causing NS (Supplemental Figure 4) (36). Our data therefore empha￾size the pathogenic role of RHO GTPase signaling in human SRNS.
Knockdown of arhgdia in animal models recapitulates NS and responds 
to treatment. To further validate the causative roles of ARHGDIA
mutations in the SRNS disease phenotypes, we performed knock￾down of the ARHGDIA ortholog in zebrafish. We observed a new 
zebrafish nephrosis phenotype at the whole-animal level, in 
which the fish develop periorbital edema (“bug eye” phenotype) 
and total body edema, reminiscent of the signs of NS in humans 
(Figure 5, A and B). For zebrafish gene knockdown experiments, 
we used a p53 morpholino-oligonucleotide (MO) as a negative 
control to minimize nonspecific apoptotic MO effects (37). p53
MO injection into fertilized zebrafish eggs at the 1- to 4-cell stage 
did not produce any phenotype through 168 hours post fertil￾ization (hpf) (Figure 5A). Coinjection of the p53 control MO 
with an MO targeting the translation initiation site of zebrafish 
arhgdia caused the nephrosis phenotype of periorbital and total 
body edema in 70% of embryos at 120 hpf (Figure 5B). Similar 
results were obtained with an MO targeting the splice acceptor 
site (Supplemental Figure 8). The proteinuric effect of the arhgdia
MO was confirmed using an established zebrafish proteinuria 
ELISA assay (38) against a fusion protein of vitamin D–bind￾ing protein and GFP in /-fabp::VDBP-GFP transgenic zebrafish 
(Figure 5E). Similarly, the protein uptake assay using Drosophila
pericardial nephrocytes, which share remarkable similarities 
to the glomerular podocytes (39), showed that knockdown of 
Drosophila RhoGDI (CG7823) in nephrocytes reduced the uptake 
ability of the secreted fusion protein of rat atrial natriuretic factor 
(ANF) and GFP, suggesting that CG7823 is required for nephro￾cyte function in Drosophila (Supplemental Figure 9).
We used our zebrafish model of arhgdia knockdown to further 
investigate the role of RHO GTPase inhibitors in the pathogene￾sis of SRNS due to loss of ARHGDIA function. The sign of peri￾orbital edema provided a reproducible and obvious phenotypic 
readout of nephrosis (Figure 5, A and B). We tested RAC1 inhibi￾tors and the mineralocorticoid inhibitor eplerenone because it has 
been described in Arhgdia–/– mice that RAC1 (but not RHOA) was 
increased and enhanced mineralocorticoid receptor–dependent 
(MR-dependent) signaling, while a RAC-specific small-molecule 
inhibitor diminished MR overactivity and renal damage, as did MR 
blockade by eplerenone (34).
We found that RAC1 inhibitors were partially effective in our 
zebrafish model in reducing edema from 70% in untreated arhgdia
knockdown zebrafish to 47% for the RAC1 inhibitor–treated 
fish (Millipore), 47% for the RAC1 inhibitor II–treated fish 
(Millipore), and 54% for eplerenone-treated fish, whereas RHO 
inhibitors (RHO inhibitor 1, Y-27632, and fasudil) showed no 
effect (Figure 5C). A dose-response curve revealed that the 50% 
inhibitory coefficient (IC50) of the RAC1 inhibitor was 8.85 μM 
(Figure 5D). The protective effect of RAC1 inhibitor against 
arhgdia knockdown was also confirmed quantitatively by a pro￾teinuria assay (Figure 5E). Our findings again confirm that RAC1 
function is more important than RHOA in the pathogenesis 
caused by ARHGDIA mutations, as we demonstrated by RAC1 
activation studies (Figures 3 and 4) and as has been suggested in 
an Arhgdia–/– mouse model (34). In summary, we recapitulated 
the NS phenotype in zebrafish upon knockdown of arhgdia and 
revealed a mitigating effect of eplerenone and RAC1 inhibitors in 
the arhgdia zebrafish model.
Discussion
We demonstrate here that WER, when combined with homozy￾gosity mapping (24), represents a valid approach for the iden￾tification of novel causative genes in rare recessive diseases. We 
believe this is the first study reporting ARHGDIA mutations in 
humans, thereby revealing this gene’s regulatory role in RHO 
GTPase activity in podocytes. In summary, we found that

Effects of ARHGDIA knockdown on RHO GTPase activity and podocyte migration in cultured human podocytes. (A) Active GTP-bound RAC1 
and CDC42 precipitated from podocytes transfected with scrambled (Scr) or ARHGDIA siRNA using a GST-PAK1 (CRIB) pulldown assay. 
Ponceau red staining at the top shows the GST proteins used. Compared with control podoctyes, podocytes transfected with ARHGDIA 
siRNA exhibited a significant increase in relative RAC1 and CDC42 (168% and 185%, respectively). The efficiency of knockdown by siRNA 
was confirmed by immunoblotting with an anti-ARHGDIA antibody (second to lowest panel). (B) Active GTP-bound RHOA precipitated from 
podocytes transfected with scrambled or ARHGDIA siRNA using a GST-rhotekin (RBD) pulldown assay. Cells transfected with scrambled 
control siRNA versus ARHGDIA siRNA exhibited no significant difference in relative RHOA activity. A and B represent 3 experiments each.

ARHGDIA mutations in SRNS abrogate interaction with RHO 
GTPases, increase active GTP-bound RAC1 and CDC42, and 
result in a migratory phenotypic change in podocytes.
RHO GTPases control a wide range of cellular processes, includ￾ing cell adhesion, migration, and proliferation, so their activity 
should be tightly controlled. At any given time, only a small 
fraction of all RHO GTPases present in the cell are in the active 
GTP-bound state and are associated with membranes (40). The 
inactive GDP-bound pool is maintained in the cytosol by associat￾ing with RHO-specific guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors 
(RHOGDIs). There are 3 genes encoding RHOGDIs in mammals 
(29). ARHGDIA (also known as RHOGDI1 or RHOGDIα) is the 
most abundant, is ubiquitously expressed, and interacts with sev￾eral RHO GTPases, including RHOA, RHOC, RAC1, RAC2, and 
CDC42 (29). ARHGDIA was considered to passively lock RHO 
GTPases in an inactive state, but this view has now been changed 
by the finding that ARHGDIA actively controls the homeosta￾sis of RHO GTPases (41). Recently, several works using mouse 
genetics have shown the importance of RHO GTPase signaling in 
podocytes (16–18). Wang et al. showed that transgenic mice over￾expressing either constitutively active or dominant-negative Rhoa
in podocytes have foot process effacement and proteinuria (18). 
In addition, Scott et al. showed that podocyte-specific deletion 
of CDC42 (but not RHOA and RAC1) in mice also results in foot 
process effacement and proteinuria (17). The results of inactive 
RHOA (Rhoa knockout versus dominant-negative Rhoa transgenic 
mice) seem discrepant in these 2 studies, or they may suggest that 
the presence of dominant-negative Rhoa, rather than the absence 
of RHOA, causes a more severe imbalance of RHOA and RAC1/
CDC42 signaling. Previously, it was demonstrated that active 
RAC1 (but not RHOA) is upregulated in Arhgdia–/– mice (34). In 
this study, we show that the ARHGDIA mutations identified in 
SRNS cause the upregulation of both RAC1 and CDC42. This 
is congruent with the finding by Akilesh et al. that ARHGAP24
mutation was associated with FSGS and led to a podocyte pheno￾type very similar to that found in ARHGDIA mutations, i.e., acti￾vation of RAC1 and CDC42 (but not RHOA), increased migratory 
phenotype, and proteinuria (31). In conclusion, aberrant activa￾Figure 5

tion of RHOA, RAC1, or CDC42 seems harmful to podocytes. 
However, it is not clear whether activation of RAC1 or CDC42 
alone is sufficient, or whether activation of both is necessary to 
cause foot process effacement and proteinuria. Furthermore, it is 
necessary to investigate how the enhanced migratory phenotype 
in podocytes caused by the activation of RAC1/CDC42 ultimately 
leads to foot process effacement.
In this study, we show that ARHGDIA mutations caused dissocia￾tion of RHOA, RAC1, and CDC42 from ARHGDIA, and that there￾after, only RAC1 and CDC42 switched to active GTP–bound forms. 
RHOA was not converted to active forms and still remained in the 
inactive GDP-bound forms. This suggests that RHOA is regulated 
differently after it dissociates from ARHGDIA and other factors, 
and that GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs), guanine nucleotide 
exchange factors (GEFs), or SMURF1 (32) may be involved.
ARHGDIA is expressed in most tissues, whereas the other 
2 RHOGDIs (RHOGDIβ and RHOGDIγ) show tissue-specific 
expression (29). Considering its ubiquitous expression pattern, it 
is interesting that defects in ARHGDIA lead to prominent renal 
phenotypes in both humans and mice. Arhgdia–/– mice addition￾ally show impaired spermatogenesis in males as well as massive 
proteinuria, which leads to death due to renal failure within a year 
(30). It is not clear whether individuals with ARHGDIA mutations 
also have abnormal reproductive phenotypes, however, 3 of 4 
(75%) individuals from 2 independent families had neurological 
phenotypes including intellectual disability (Table 1). Podocytes 
share many cell biological characteristics with neurons. RHO 
GTPases also play important roles in regulating dendritic spines 
and branches and are vital for the maintenance and reorganization 
of dendritic structures in maturing neurons (42). Therefore, it is 
interesting to investigate whether Arhgdia–/– mice also have neuro￾logical defects or morphological abnormalities in neurons.
Our finding that RHO GTPase signaling is an important com￾ponent of NS pathogenesis is emphasized by several factors: (a) 
The fact that single-gene recessive mutations in humans usually 
convey 100% penetrance and the finding that there was high pen￾etrance in the zebrafish model of arhgdia knockdown demonstrate 
that ARHGDIA function is necessary to avoid the NS disease phe￾notype. (b) An exaggerated migratory phenotype in podocytes 
resulted from the activation of RAC1/CDC42 (but not RHOA) and 
was reversed by RAC1 inhibitors and an MR blocker. (c) Demon￾stration of mitigation of the zebrafish NS model by drugs that 
interfere with RAC1 function implicates RAC1 in the pathogenesis 
of SRNS via another independent route.
In summary, our findings of ARHGDIA mutation implicate the 
RHO small GTPase RAC1/CDC42 in the pathogenesis of human 
NS and permit a noninvasive, causation-based diagnosis. Further￾more, the zebrafish models we generated allow for the screening of 
new therapeutic options for NS.
Methods
Study participants. Informed consent was obtained from individuals world￾wide with SRNS or SSNS for the use of their clinical data and blood sam￾ples. The diagnosis of NS was made by (pediatric) nephrologists based on 
standardized clinical and renal histological criteria (43). Renal biopsies 
were evaluated by renal pathologists. Clinical data were obtained using a 
standardized questionnaire (http://www.renalgenes.org).
Homozygosity mapping. We performed homozygosity mapping of indi￾viduals with SRNS or SSNS as established previously (24). We used the 
Human Mapping 250k StyI array or the Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human 
SNP Array 6.0. Genomic DNA samples were hybridized and scanned at 
the University of Michigan Core Facility using the manufacturer’s stan￾dard protocol. Nonparametric lod (NPL) scores were calculated for both 
affected siblings together in family A1432 as described in Hildebrandt et 
al. (24) using ALLEGRO and assuming first-degree cousin consanguinity 
of the parents, regardless of actual consanguinity status. Nonparametric 
NPL scores (minor allele frequency >0.2) were plotted over genetic dis￾tance across the genome, where chromosomal positions are concatenated 
from the p arm to the q arm (left to right) (see Figure 1A). Homozygosity 
peaks exceeding the empirical cutoff value of 2.0 represent possible seg￾ments of homozygosity by descent, one of which (Figure 1A, black arrow￾head) harbors the homozygous disease-causing gene mutation in family 
A1432. We set the disease allele frequency at 0.0001, and used mixed Euro￾pean descent marker allele frequencies.
WER. Exome enrichment was conducted following the manufacturer’s 
protocol for the NimbleGen SeqCap EZ Exome v2 beads (Roche Nimble￾Gen). The kit interrogates a total of approximately 30,000 genes (~330,000 
consensus-coding DNA sequence [CCDS] exons). Massively parallel 
sequencing was performed largely as described in Bentley et al. (44) Briefly, 
3 μg of genomic DNA was fragmented by sonication using the Covaris S2 
system to achieve a uniform distribution of fragments with a mean size 
of 300 bp. The fragmented DNA was purified using Agencourt’s AMPure 
XP Solid Phase Reversible Immobilization paramagnetic (SPRI) beads, fol￾lowed by polishing of the DNA ends by removing the 3′ overhangs and 
filling in the 5′ overhangs that resulted from sonication using T4 DNA 
polymerase and the Klenow fragment (New England BioLabs). Following 
end polishing, a single A-base was added to the 3′ end of the DNA frag￾ments using Klenow fragment (3′ to 5′ exo minus). This prepares the DNA 
fragments for ligation to specialized adaptors that have a T-base overhang 
at their 3′ ends. The end-repaired DNA with a single A-base overhang 
was ligated to Illumina paired-end adaptors in a standard ligation reac￾tion using T4 DNA ligase and a 2- to 4-μM final adaptor concentration, 
depending on the postpurification DNA yield after addition of the A-base 
(a 10-fold molar excess of adaptors was used in each reaction). Following 
ligation, the samples were purified using SPRI beads amplified by 6 cycles 
of PCR to maintain complexity and to avoid bias due to amplification and 
were then quality controlled by library size assessment using the Agilent 
Bioanalyzer and quantitated using PicoGreen reagent (Invitrogen).
One microgram of amplified, purified DNA (DNA library) was prepared 
for hybridization by adding to the DNA library COT1 DNA and blocking 
oligonucleotides, desiccating the DNA completely and resuspending the 
material in NimbleGen (Roche NimbleGen) hybridization buffer. The 
resuspended material was denatured at 95°C prior to addition of the exome 
capture library bait material. The DNA library and biotin-labeled capture 
library were then hybridized by incubation at 47°C for 68 hours. Follow￾ing hybridization, streptavidin-coated magnetic beads were used to purify 
the DNA:DNA hybrids formed between the capture library and sequencing 
library during hybridization. The purified sequencing library was amplified 
directly from the purification beads using 8 cycles of PCR with Pfx DNA 
polymerase (Invitrogen). The libraries were purified following amplifica￾tion, and the library size was assessed using the Agilent Bioanalyzer. A single 
peak between 350 to 400 bp indicates a properly constructed and amplified 
library that is ready for sequencing. Final quantitation of the library was 
performed using the Kapa Biosystems Real-time PCR assay, and appro￾priate amounts were loaded onto the Illumina flow cell for sequencing by 
paired-end 100-nt sequencing on the Illumina HiSeq 2000.
Mutation calling. Sequence reads were mapped to the human reference 
genome assembly (NCBI build 36/hg18) using CLC Genomics Workbench 
(version 4.7.2) software (CLC bio). Mutation calling was performed with a 
team of geneticists and cell biologists who had knowledge of the clinical

esis method. The immortalized human podocytes (46) were maintained 
in RPMI plus GlutaMAX-I (Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS, penicil￾lin-streptomycin (50 IU/ml and 50 μg/ml, respectively), and insulin-trans￾ferrin-selenium-X. Plasmids and siRNA were transfected into podocytes 
grown at the permissive temperature of 33°C using Lipofectamine 
2000 (Invitrogen). Podocytes were cultured for differentiation at 37°C for 
14 days. The ARHGDIA-specific and control scrambled siRNAs were pur￾chased from Dharmacon or Sigma-Aldrich. Lymphoblasts were purified 
from blood samples of individuals (A1432-21, A2338-26, and A4565-11 
in Supplemental Figure 3) using Ficoll-Paque PLUS (GE Healthcare) 
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The isolated lymphoblasts 
were transformed by EBV and immortalized as previously described (47).
Immunoblotting, immunoprecipitation, pulldown assay, and immunofluorescence 
staining. These experiments were performed as described previously (48). 
The GST-PAK1 CRIB domain was purified from the BL21(DE3) E. coli
strain, and GST-rhotekin RBD beads were purchased from Cytoskeleton. 
Anti-FLAG, anti-Myc (Cell Signaling Technology), anti-RAC1, anti-CDC42 
(BD Transduction Laboratories), anti-ARHGDIA, anti-RHOA (Santa Cruz 
Biotechnology), and anti-synaptopodin (American Research Products) 
were purchased from the indicated commercial sources. Anti-podocalyxin 
and anti-GLEPP1 antibodies were provided by Roger C. Wiggins. Anti￾PLCε1 antibody was previously described by Hinkes et al. (21) and was 
labeled using an APEX Alexa Fluor Labeling Kit (Invitrogen). Coimmuno￾precipitation was performed using EZview Red ANTI-FLAG M2 Affinity 
Gel (Sigma-Aldrich). The intensities of immunoblots were analyzed using 
Quantity One (BioRad). Fluorescence images were obtained with a Leica 
SP5X laser scanning microscope.
Podocyte migration assay. Real-time migration assays were performed using 
the xCELLigence system (Roche Applied Science) in CIM-plate 16 accord￾ing to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, 24 hours after transfection, 
4 × 104 cells were plated in serum-free media in the upper chamber. The 
lower chambers were filled with 10% FBS for chemoattraction or with 
serum-free media. The data were analyzed using RTCA software. Results 
are presented as the time-versus-cell index curve.
Zebrafish studies. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) were maintained and reared as 
described previously (38). Approval for zebrafish research was obtained 
from the University Committee on the Use and Care of Animals (UCUCA) 
of the University of Michigan. MOs were injected into the AB* wild-type 
strain for phenotype analysis of morphants and drug treatment. The pro￾teinuria assays were performed using l-fabp::VDBP-GFP transgenic fish and 
a GFP ELISA kit (Cell Biolabs) as described previously (38).
Statistics. Results are presented as the means ± SEM or SD for the indi￾cated number of experiments. Statistical analysis of continuous data was 
performed with a 2-tailed Student t test or a Mann-Whitney U test, as 
appropriate. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Study approval. Approval for human subjects research was obtained from 
the IRBs of the University of Michigan, the Université Paris Descartes, and 
the University of Cologne.

phenotypes and pedigree structure, as well as experience with homozy￾gosity mapping and exome evaluation. Minimum length fraction of a 
read to match the reference sequence was set to 90%. For SNP detection, 
the minimum quality score of the central base as well as the minimum 
average quality score of surrounding bases were kept at a default score of 
20 and 15, respectively. Quality assessment was performed within a win￾dow of 11 bases. Only reads that uniquely aligned to the reference genome 
were used for variant SNP or deletion/insertion polymorphism (DIP) call￾ing. In patients with evidence of homozygosity by descent, the threshold 
for the number of reads (minor allele frequency) was set to greater than 
55%. The threshold coverage for minimum valid reads (minimum variant 
count), which displays the variant at a given position, was set to 2 reads.
Filtering of variants from the normal reference sequence (28). For DIPs and SNPs, 
we used the following a priori criteria to restrict the high number of variants 
from normal reference sequences (VRSs) (average of 53,272 for DIPs and 
315,372 for SNPs) as follows (see Supplemental Table 1): (a) We retained exo￾nic variants (missense, nonsense, indels) and obligatory splice site variants 
only. (b) We included only VRSs that are not listed in the SNP132 database 
of innocuous polymorphisms. (c) We evaluated exonic changes only within 
genomic regions, in which homozygosity mapping showed linkage for 
both affected siblings. (d) Variants were analyzed using the BLAT program 
(http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgBlat?command=start) on the UCSC 
Human Genome Bioinformatics Browser (http://genome.ucsc.edu/) for the 
presence of paralogous genes, pseudogenes, misalignments at the ends of 
sequence reads, and to determine whether the variant is a known dbSNP132 
with an allele frequency greater than 1% in populations of mixed European 
descent. In families in whom mapping demonstrated homozygosity by 
descent, we retained only homozygous variants and scrutinized all of them 
in the sequence alignments within the CLC Genomic Workbench software 
program for the presence of mismatches indicating potential false align￾ments or poor sequence quality. (e) Sanger sequencing was performed to 
confirm the remaining variants in original DNA samples and to test for 
intrafamilial segregation in a recessive mode. (f) Finally, the remaining 
variants were ranked by whether mutations were truncating the conceptual 
reading frame (nonsense, frameshift, and obligatory splice variants) or by 
evolutionary conservation analysis of missense variants. We also used web￾based programs to predict the impact of disease candidate variants on the 
encoded protein or to predict whether these variants were known disease￾causing mutations (see Supplemental Table 1).
Segregation analysis by Sanger sequencing. We applied Sanger dideoxy termi￾nator sequencing to confirm and segregate potential disease-causing vari￾ants in the respective patients, their affected siblings, and their parents. In 
patients in whom only 1 heterozygous mutation was detected by exome 
capture and massively parallel sequencing, all exons and flanking intronic 
sequences of the respective gene(s) were analyzed by Sanger sequencing. A 
touchdown PCR protocol was used as described previously (45). Sequenc￾ing was performed using a BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit 
on an ABI 3730 XL sequencer (Applied Biosystems). Sequence traces were 
analyzed using Sequencher software, version 4.8 (Gene Codes Corp.).
Web-based variant analysis. Predictions of the possible impact of an amino 
acid substitution on chemical change, evolutionary conservation, and 
protein function were obtained by using the following web-based pro￾grams: PolyPhen-2 (http://genetics.bwh.harvard.edu/pph2/), SIFT, (Sort￾ing Intolerant from Tolerant; http://sift.jcvi.org/), and Mutation Taster 
(http://www.mutationtaster.org/). Genomic evolutionary rate profiling 
(GERP) calculation was performed using the following: http://snp.gs.
