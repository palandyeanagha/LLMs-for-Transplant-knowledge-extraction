Background/Aims: Gastric varices (GVs) are a major cause 
of upper gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with liver cirrho￾sis. The current treatments of choice are balloon-occluded 
retrograde transvenous obliteration (BRTO) and the place￾ment of a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt 
(TIPS). We aimed to compare the efficacy and outcomes 
of these two methods for the management of GV bleeding. 
Methods: This retrospective study included consecutive pa￾tients who received BRTO (n=157) or TIPS (n=19) to control 
GV bleeding from January 2005 to December 2014 at a 
single tertiary hospital in Korea. The overall survival (OS), im￾mediate bleeding control rate, rebleeding rate and complica￾tion rate were compared between patients in the BRTO and 
TIPS groups. Results: Patients in the BRTO group showed 
higher immediate bleeding control rates (p=0.059, odds 
ratio [OR]=4.72) and lower cumulative rebleeding rates (log￾rank p=0.060) than those in the TIPS group, although the dif￾ference failed to reach statistical significance. There were no 
significant differences in the rates of complications, including 
pleural effusion, aggravation of esophageal varices, portal 
hypertensive gastropathy, and portosystemic encephalopa￾thy, although the rate of the progression of ascites was sig￾nificantly higher in the BRTO group (p=0.02, OR=7.93). After 
adjusting for several confounding factors using a multivariate 
Cox analysis, the BRTO group had a significantly longer OS 
(adjusted hazard ratio [aHR]=0.44, p=0.01) and a longer 
rebleeding-free survival (aHR=0.34, p=0.001) than the TIPS 
group. Conclusions: BRTO provides better bleeding control, 
rebleeding-free survival, and OS than TIPS for patients with 
GV bleeding. (Gut Liver 2018;12:704-713)

INTRODUCTION
Gastric varices (GV) are one of the most common complica￾tions of liver cirrhosis, occurring in approximately 20% of the 
patients.1,2 GV bleeding is more severe (as reflected in transfu￾sion requirement) than esophageal varices (EV) bleeding with 
higher mortality rates of up to 45% and 35% to 90% of patients 
were reported to rebleed after spontaneous hemostasis.3-5
Traditionally, it has been reported that endoscopic therapy 
such as endoscopic variceal ligation (EVL) or endoscopic varice￾al obturation (EVO) have important roles in treating GV bleed￾ing.6
 Those endoscopic approaches, however, is quite limited 
to apply for GV bleeding. Basically, EVL should be performed 
on small GV, because it is difficult to suction both mucosal 
and contralateral wall of the vessel into ligator due to its large 
diameter and thick vessel wall.7
 In addition, EVL could be used 
to control GV bleeding only from GOV1, EV extending below 
gastric cardia along lesser curvature. EV extending into fundus 
along greater curvature (GOV2) and isolated GV located in fun￾dus (IGV1), which commonly referred to as cardio-fundal vari￾ces, cannot be effectively treated by band ligation technically. 
Although GOV1 is most common type of GV (75% of GV), the

risk of bleeding is relatively lower than other types of GV: IGV1 
(78%)>GOV2 (55%)>GOV1 (10%).2,8 Those cardio-fundal vari￾ces which have higher risk of bleeding should be controlled by 
EVO instead. EVO has been proved fair safety and efficacy,9,10
however, the major adverse effect of EVO is systemic emboliza￾tion including pulmonary embolism, stroke, and multi-organ 
infarction which may even cause death.11-13 Also premature 
extrusion of glue cast after EVO can lead to catastrophic re￾bleeding. Meanwhile, lower rebleeding rates have been reported 
with transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) and 
balloon-occluded retrograde transvenous obliteration (BRTO) 
compared with endoscopic therapy.14 Therefore, TIPS and BRTO 
are currently considered the treatments of choice for GV bleed￾ing, especially for patients with massive, refractory, or recurrent 
bleeding.14-16 In clinics in the Western countries, TIPS is the first￾line therapy for GV bleeding to decompress portal hypertension, 
whereas in Asia, especially South Korea and Japan, BRTO is the 
mainstay of hemostasis to treat GV.17,18
Intrahepatic shunts redirect portal blood flow to systemic 
circulation, thereby promptly relieving portal hypertension. For 
this reason, TIPS can minimize the associated complications, 
such as intractable ascites, portal hypertensive gastropathy 
(PHG), enteropathy, and various types of varices. However, TIPS 
may exacerbate portosystemic encephalopathy (PSE) as the 
portal venous blood bypasses the liver and does not undergo 
detoxification. Although this is avoided with BRTO,19 blockade 
of the gastrorenal shunt during this procedure increases the in￾flow of portal venous blood to the liver, which may aggravate 
portal hypertension.17 Thus, we conducted a study to compare 
these opposing approaches to GV bleeding management and 
determine their efficacy and associated complication rates.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
1. Study population
We retrospectively studied 278 consecutive patients who 
received either BRTO or TIPS for GV bleeding from January 
2005 to December 2014 at a single tertiary hospital in Korea 
(Seoul National University Hospital). The GV bleeding are de￾fined as the intersection of a symptom related to bleeding such 
as hematemesis, melena, or hematochezia (in case of massive 
bleeding), and identified stigma of recent bleeding in esopha￾gogastroduodenoscopy following: (1) active spurting or oozing 
bleeding; (2) adherent clot, whit nipple sign or red nipple sign 
on GV; (3) no any other bleeding focus except large GV. Pa￾tients who were treated mainly for reasons other than GV bleed￾ing, such as EV bleeding, refractory ascites, PHG, and so forth, 
were excluded. Further exclusion criteria were technical failure, 
insufficient clinical data, and death right after the procedure. 
Ultimately, 102 patients were excluded, leaving 176 patients for 
statistical analysis (Fig. 1). 
2. BRTO procedure 
The operator punctured right femoral vein under the ultraso￾nography and inserted sheath and Davis catheter. After select￾ing the left renal vein and inserting occlusion balloon catheter 
(Boston Scientific, Cork, Ireland, or Clinical Supply, Gifu, Japan), 
the operator performed angiography to check feeding veins, 
draining veins, and small variceal collaterals. These small ves￾sels were embolized by microcoils or Gelform sponge particles 
to prevent leakage of the sclerosing agent. Then 5% of etha￾nolamine oleate (n=54; used until August 2009; Keuk Dong, 
Incheon, Korea) or 3% of sodium tetradecyl sulfate (n=103; 
used after September 2009; Tromboject, Omega Laboratories,

Montreal, Canada) mixed with water-soluble contrast media 
(Pamiray; Dongkook, Jincheon, Korea) was injected to GV until 
it fully filled the gastric varix. The inflated balloon was main￾tained during overnight. In the early morning of the next day, 
the operator evaluated the presence of regurgitated fresh blood 
from the balloon catheter. If complete thrombosis was achieved 
without regurgitated blood, the balloon catheter was removed 
immediately in the angiography suite. If fresh blood was regur￾ged from the balloon catheter, additional sclerosing agent was 
injected, and the balloon catheter was maintained for approxi￾mately 6 to 8 hours.
3. TIPS procedure
The operator punctured right internal jugular vein under 
the guidance of ultrasonography and inserted TIPS sheath and 
Davis catheter. After selecting right or middle hepatic vein, the 
operator checked right portal vein using CO2 portogram and 
then punctured right portal vein using the Colapinto needle 
(Cook Medical, Inc., Bloomington, IN, USA). Then preprocedural 
pressure gradient (mean±standard deviation [SD], 21.7±5.7) be￾tween inferior vena cava and portal vein was measured. Eight 
millimeter or 10 mm balloon delivered to a tract between RHV 
and RPV was used for dilation. The 10 mm covered (n=13; Tae￾woong, Seoul, Korea) or bare (n=6; Taewoong) Niti-S stent was 
placed in the dilated tract, followed by stent dilation if neces￾sary. The postprocedural pressure gradient (mean±SD, 11.1±3.6) 
and the decrement in the pressure gradient (mean±SD, 10.6±3.7) 
was measured and the flow of blood in the shunt was checked 
using angiography.
4. Ethical consideration
The study was reviewed and approved by the Seoul National 
University Institutional Review Board (IRB number: H-1603-
054-748). The study was conducted in accordance with the most 
recent ethical guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki, modified 
during the 64th World Medical Association meeting in Brazil in 
2013. The need for written informed consent was waived due to 
the retrospective nature of the study and because there were no 
study-specific interventions beyond routine clinical care. Patient 
records were anonymized and de-identified prior to analysis. 
5. Study endpoints
The primary endpoint was the overall survival (OS) of the 
patients. The secondary endpoints were immediate bleeding 
control rate (bleeding controlled within one day after the proce￾dure), cumulative rebleeding rate, and GV rebleeding-free sur￾vival. We also compared the rates of complications, including 
the aggravation of EV, PHG, pleural effusion, ascites, PSE, and 
the occurrence of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) and 
hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). In addition, changes in liver func￾tion before and after the interventions were compared based on 
levels of albumin, total bilirubin, creatinine, prothrombin time/

Changes in GV after the procedure were evaluated by esopha￾gogastroduodenoscopy at two points: before and within 3 
months after the procedure. EV and PHG were evaluated by 
esophagogastroduodenoscopy after the intervention, and pleural 
effusion was evaluated by chest X-ray. Ascites was evaluated 
mainly by computed tomography at two points: before and 
within 1 month after the procedure, and PSE was evaluated 
from descriptive medical records. SBP and HRS were identified 
by laboratory findings.
6. Statistical analysis
The baseline characteristics and complication rates of the two 
groups were compared using two-sample t or Wilcoxon rank 
sum tests for continuous variables and chi-square or Fisher ex￾act tests for categorical variables. Changes in liver function were 
assessed by paired t-tests. The OS and GV bleeding-free survival 
were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method, and the cumula￾tive probabilities of events were compared using a log-rank test. 
A Cox proportional hazards model was used to identify and ad￾just for independent risk factors for survival. Inverse probability 
weighting (IPW) based on propensity scores was conducted 
to balance the baseline characteristics of the two groups and 
Kaplan-Meier plots for survival analysis were fitted thereafter. 
Variables with a p-value of <0.05 in the univariate Cox regres￾sion analysis were used in the multivariate analysis. Differences 
with a p-value of <0.05 were considered statistically significant. 
All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 18.0 
(SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).

tween the BRTO and TIPS groups except for patient age, the 
rate of concurrent hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), presence of 
active bleeding and initial hemoglobin (Hb) level. Patients in 
the BRTO group were significantly older and had a significantly 
higher rate of concurrent HCC than those in the TIPS group. 
In addition, BRTO group showed lower rate of active bleeding 
and lower initial Hb level. The most common etiology of liver 
cirrhosis was hepatitis B virus-related cirrhosis followed by 
alcoholic cirrhosis. Baseline liver functions did not differ signifi￾cantly between the two groups. 
2. Overall survival and prognostic factors
The 5-year survival rate was 38.5% in the BRTO group and 
34.4% in the TIPS group. In the univariate analysis, there was 
no significant difference in OS between the two groups (hazard 
ratio [HR], 0.83; p=0.51). Some variables, such as sex (HR, 0.57; 
p=0.035), concurrent HCC (HR, 2.22; p<0.001), liver transplan￾tation (HR, 0.25; p=0.006), albumin levels (HR, 0.50; p<0.001), 
total bilirubin levels (HR, 1.05; p<0.001), prothrombin time (HR, 
1.92, p<0.001), ascites (HR, 1.72; p=0.030 for mild to moder￾ate; HR, 2.03; p=0.038 for severe), presence of active bleeding, 
(HR, 1.80; p=0.02), and initial Hb (HR, 0.89; p=0.006) were as￾sociated with OS in the univariate analysis. In the multivariate 
analysis using the associated factors mentioned above, age and 
treatment method, the patients in the BRTO group had a signifi￾cantly longer OS than those in the TIPS group (adjusted HR, 0.44; 
95% confidence interval [CI], 0.23 to 0.84; p=0.01) (Table 2, Fig. 
2). Young age, female sex, absence of concurrent HCC, post￾liver transplantation status, high albumin levels, low bilirubin 
levels, and low prothrombin time were good prognostic factors 
for OS in GV bleeding patients in the multivariate analysis. Af￾ter balancing age, gender, and baseline liver function by using 
IPW, patients in the BRTO group showed significantly longer OS 
than the TIPS group (HR, 1.80; 95% CI, 1.40 to 2.31; p<0.001).
3. Immediate bleeding control rate, rebleeding rate, and GV 
rebleeding-free survival
Patients in the BRTO group had somewhat higher immediate 
bleeding control rates (96.2% vs 84.2%; odds ratio [OR], 4.72; 
95% CI, 1.08 to 20.70; p=0.06) and lower trend of rebleeding 
rates (HR, 0.60; log-rank p=0.06) (Fig. 3) than those in the TIPS 
group without statistical significance. 
The 5-year GV rebleeding-free survival rate was 38.6% in 
the BRTO group and 23.4% in the TIPS group. In the univariate 
analysis, there was no significant difference in GV rebleeding￾free survival (HR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.35 to 1.03; p=0.061) (Table 3) 
between the BRTO group and the TIPS group. In the multivari￾ate analysis, however, GV rebleeding-free survival was signifi￾cantly longer in the BRTO group (adjusted HR, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.18 
to 0.63; p=0.001) (Table 3).
4. Reduction in the GV after the procedure
After the procedure, GV was reduced in the BRTO group with 
proportion of 24.8% and in the TIPS group with proportion of 
9.1%. However, there was no significant difference between the 
two groups (p=0.24).
5. Complications after procedures
There were no significant differences between the two groups 
in terms of aggravation of EV, PHG, and pleural effusion after 
treatment (p=0.48, p=0.61, and p=0.07, respectively) (Table 4).

development of SBP and HRS (log-rank p=0.43 and p=0.21, 
respectively). The grade of ascites was significantly aggravated 
one month after BRTO (p<0.001) with proportion of 30.6% but 
not after TIPS (p=0.32) with proportion of 5.3%. With regard to 
PSE, the most concerning complication from TIPS, there was 
no significant change after the procedure in the BRTO group 
(p=0.10) and the TIPS group (p=1.00); 2.5% of the BRTO group 
patients and none of the TIPS group patients developed or got 
aggravated PSE.
6. Changes in liver function
Changes in liver function after each procedure are shown in 
Table 5 and Fig. 4. As shown in Fig. 4, Child-Pugh and MELD 
scores gradually decreased in patients who received BRTO, in￾dicating an improvement in liver function. In contrast, these 
scores increased in patients who received TIPS for one month 
immediately after the procedure, and then decreased thereafter.

MELD scores better. In the TIPS group, only the albumin levels 
at 12 months improved significantly (p=0.009).
DISCUSSION
In this study, we found that BRTO for GV bleeding signifi￾cantly prolonged overall and GV rebleeding-free survival com￾pared with TIPS. In addition, BRTO showed considerable trend 
of better immediate bleeding control and a lower chance of 
rebleeding although it failed to reach the statistical significance. 
Complication rates were similar between both procedures, 
though BRTO tended to aggravate ascites more than TIPS. The

liver function in patients who underwent BRTO gradually im￾proved after the procedure.
Recently, several studies have suggested that BRTO is a better 
treatment option for patients with GV.19-21 Although Choi et al.
22
also concluded that BRTO is a good alternative to the placement 
of TIPS due to immediate hemostasis, absence of rebleeding, 
and improved liver function, their sample sizes were too small 
to establish statistical significance. Ninoi et al.
23 reported that 
patients who received BRTO had lower rebleeding rates and 
higher 5-year survival than those who received TIPS. However,

the OS of patients with poor liver function (Child-Pugh class 
B or C) did not differ between the treatments. A meta-analysis 
by Wang et al.
19 revealed that BRTO had more advantages than 
TIPS, including lower rates for rebleeding and PSE. Neverthe￾less, the authors recommended BRTO only as an alternative 
method rather than a treatment of choice for GV because of the 
quality of the original studies. Most recently, Lee et al.
24 showed 
better OS in patients who underwent BRTO, but this did not 
remain significant in the multivariate analysis, as the baseline 
liver function was better in the BRTO group than in the TIPS 
group. 
Our findings provide evidence worthy to be considered evi￾dence that BRTO is indeed superior to TIPS placement for treat￾ing GV bleeding especially in patients with PSE or decreased 
liver function. Most importantly, our study included a larger 
population of patients than previous studies and compared 
groups with similar baseline liver functions. In addition, our 
data were obtained from a single center, and thus the qual￾ity control for the procedures was similar. Another advantage 
of our study is that we also assessed bleeding control rate and 
various complications. For example, we identified that BRTO 
and TIPS groups had similar risks for EV, PHG, and pleural ef￾fusion after each procedure. The increase in portal hypertension 
with BRTO does not contraindicate its use. However, BRTO did 
increase the development of ascites and should thus be applied 
carefully in patients who have refractory ascites. The blood flow 
to the portal vein increases after BRTO because the procedure 
obliterates the gastrorenal shunt which can be a sort of bypass 
route of the portal vein. Therefore, portal hypertension could 
be aggravated, resulting in development of PHG (occurs in 5% 
to 13%), ascites (0% to 44%), and hydrothorax/pleural effu￾sion (0% to 8%).25 Nevertheless, hepatic function in patients 
who underwent BRTO gradually improved over 12 months. It 
is well known that patients with major shunts such as GV have 
decreased portal blood flow, resulting in gradually decreased 
hepatic functional reservoir. Conversely, by obliterating these 
shunts, the decreased portal blood flow can be recovered, which 
leads to liver function improvement.22,26,27 This fact was dem￾onstrated in our study, and other studies have shown similar 
evidence for sustained improvement of hepatic function after 
BRTO.24,27
In summary, it is essential to individualize the treatment plans 
for patients with GV. BRTO would be a treatment of choice par￾ticularly for patients with hepatic encephalopathy or decreased 
liver function. On the other hand, TIPS would be better than 
BRTO for patients with refractory ascites or without gastrorenal 
shunts. 
There are some limitations of our study that should be noted. 
First, this was a retrospective study of procedures performed in 
Korea, resulting in a larger number of patients who underwent 
BRTO and fewer who received TIPS. Since the treatment modal￾ity should be selected in each patient individually considering 
the particular medical condition of the patient, it is practically 
impossible to design a prospective study such as a random￾ized controlled study. Second, the development of PSE, a well￾established major complication of TIPS, could not be defini￾tively verified. This was due to the small sample size of the TIPS 
group as well as a selection bias resulting from the tendency of 
physicians to avoid placing TIPS in patients with a high risk of 
PSE. Third, there would be some problems due to the long study 
period. There had been some changes in materials of procedures 
during the study period. The obliterating material used in BRTO 
was changed from 5% of ethanolamine oleate to 3% of sodium 
tetradecyl sulfate from September 2009. The type of stent used 
in TIPS was also changed from the covered type to the bare type 
from May 2010. Besides, the number of patients of the BRTO 
group tended to increase as time goes on while that of the TIPS 
group decreased. Those changes during the study period inevi￾tably could have affected the outcomes. As a result, a further 
well-designed prospective study is needed to confirm our find￾ings.
In conclusion, we found that BRTO is superior to TIPS with 
regard to OS and liver function improvement in patients with 
GV bleeding. For this reason, BRTO can be considered prefer￾entially for GV bleeding if feasible, especially in patients with 
hepatic encephalopathy or decreased liver function.
