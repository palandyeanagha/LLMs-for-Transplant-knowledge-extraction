Abstract
Introduction
Effective tacrolimus (TAC) dosing is hampered by complex pharmacokinetics and signifi￾cant patient variability. The gut microbiome, a key mediator of endotoxemia, inflammation
and oxidative stress in advanced heart failure (HF) patients, is a possible contributor to inter￾individual variations in drug efficacy. The effect of alterations in the gut microbiome on TAC
dosing requirements after heart transplant (HT) has not been explored.
Methods
We enrolled 24 patients (mean age = 55.8 ±2.3 years) within 3 months post-HT. Biomarkers
of endotoxemia ((lipopolysaccharide (LPS)), inflammation (tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α))
and oxidative stress (8,12-iso-Isoprostane F-2alpha-VI) were measured in 16 blood sam￾ples. 22 stool samples were analyzed using 16S rRNA sequencing. TAC dose and serum
trough level were measured at the time of stool and blood collection. TAC doses were
reported in mg/kg/day and as level-to-dose (L/D) ratio, and categorized as � vs. > median.

Results
The median TAC dose was 0.1 mg/kg/day and L/D ratio was 100.01. Above the median
daily weight-based TAC dose was associated with higher gut microbial alpha diversity (p =
0.03); similarly, TNF-α and 8,12-iso-Isoprostane F-2alpha-VI levels were lower and LPS lev￾els were higher in the above median TAC group, although these findings were only margin￾ally statistically significant and dependent on BMI adjustment. We observed n = 37 taxa to
be significantly enriched among patients with > median TAC dose (all FDR<0.05), several of
which are potential short-chain fatty acid producers with anti-inflammatory properties,
including taxa from the family Subdoligranulum.
Conclusions
Our pilot study observed gut microbial alpha diversity to be increased while inflammation
and oxidative stress were reduced among patients requiring higher TAC doses early after
HT.
Introduction
Tacrolimus (TAC) is the cornerstone of immunosuppression in heart transplant (HT) recipi￾ents [1]. Achieving and sustaining therapeutic TAC levels are essential in preventing cellular
rejection in the early post-HT period [2,3]. Unfortunately, owing to its unpredictable pharma￾cokinetic profile and significant intra- and inter-patient variability, estimating accurate TAC
dosing requirements and maintaining therapeutic levels is challenging. In the early post-trans￾plant period, many factors can influence TAC dosing, including age, race, body habitus, ane￾mia, liver dysfunction, malnutrition, changes in bowel functions such as ileus/diarrhea, drug￾drug interactions, and genotypic aberrations (i.e. CYP3A5 carrier status) [4].
The interplay between gut microbial diversity and immunosuppression drug dosing has
garnered recent interest in the solid-organ transplant community. An imbalance of microbial
communities in the gut, commonly referred to as gut dysbiosis, may disrupt the intestinal lin￾ing and alter drug absorption.This theory is supported by data showing a link between diar￾rhea and elevated TAC levels, which is thought to be related to downregulation of intestinal
cytochrome P4503A4 and P-glycoprotein activity [5]. Early animal models in rats [6] and mice
[7] have explored the relationship between TAC dosing and the composition of the gut micro￾biota and suggest a corrleation. While these animal models are provocative, the first study in
humans was by Lee et al., who evaluated 19 kidney recipients and found that gut microbial
composition was associated with TAC dosing requirements early after transplant [8]. This
association has never been evaluated in heart transplant (HT) recipients.
Our group has previosuly shown that dysbiotic gut microbial community is present among
advanced heart failure (HF) patients, and persists after HT [9]. These changes are associated
with activation of multiple inflammatory and/or oxidative stress pathways as well as elevated
levels of circulating endotoxins such as lipopolysaccharides (LPS), which is produced by
Gram-negative bacteria [9]. Alterations in the microbial composition may lead to intestinal
epithelial barrier dysfunction and increased gut permiability, i.e. ‘the leaky gut”, allowing the
translocation of pro-inflammatory bacteria and its bi-products into the peripheral circulation.
Presently, we investigate the variation in gut microbial communities, and levels of endotox￾emia, inflammation and oxidative stress in a cohort of patients within the first 3 months after

HT. We tested the following specific hypotheses cross-sectionally: 1) TAC dosing require￾ments are associated with microbial diversity; 2) TAC dosing requirements are related to levels
of endotoxemia, inflammation and oxidative stress; and 3) specific microbial signatures are
associated with TAC dosing requirements in the early post-transplant setting.
Materials and methods
Study population
This was a single center cross-sectional study of adult patients who underwent HT between
April 2017 and August 2018 and had stool and/or blood sampling available within the first 3
months after HT. This time frame was chosen as patients in the first 3 months post HT will
have similar TAC serum trough goal levels as outlined below. Patients were enrolled in the out￾patient setting during routine clinical visits or the index hospitalization for HT surgery. Demo￾graphic information (age, sex, race/ethnicity), clinical characteristics, body mass index (BMI),
and smoking status, as well as concomitant drug therapy were extracted from electronic medi￾cal records. The Columbia University Irving Medical Center (CUIMC) Institutional Review
Board approved the study protocol. All participants signed written informed consent.
Immunosuppression protocol
All patients included in this study received sequential immunosuppression in accordance with
the center’s protocol consisting of induction with high dose methylprednisolone, which was
followed by triple maintenance therapy with TAC, mycophenolate mofetil, and prednisone
taper. Immediate-release TAC was dosed twice daily and started on post-operative day 1, dos￾ages were initially weight-based and subsequently adjusted to maintain initial target levels of
10 to 12 ng/mL for the first 3 months. Mycophenolate mofetil was started at 1500 mg twice
daily on the day of surgery. All patients received antifungal (nystatin suspension), Pneumocys￾tis jiroveci (trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole or dapsone), and antiviral (valganciclovir) post￾transplantation prophylaxis for at least 6 months.
Measurement of TAC levels
TAC levels and doses were gathered at the time of stool and blood sample collection. For eval￾uating the outcomes of interest, patients were divided into two groups according to their mg/
kg/day TAC requirements: low-dose (below the cohort median) and high-dose (above the
cohort median). Each outcome was also analyzed using dose-normalized trough levels (trough
Level/Dose or L/D ratio [ng/mL]/[mg/kg/24h]), whereby low- and high-dose groups were
again defined using median dichotomization. TAC levels were measured at New-York Presby￾terian Hospital–CUIMC clinical laboratory using Chemiluminescent Microparticle Immuno￾assay (CMIA). The lower limit for detection of TAC was 2 ng/mL.
Measurements of plasma and serum biomarkers
Biomarkers of endotoxemia (lipopolysaccharide [LPS]), inflammation (tumor necrosis factor￾α [TNF-α)], and oxidative stress (8,12-iso-Isoprostane F-2alpha-VI levels) were measured in
16 samples collected and processed during a clinic visit or the inpatient setting. Serum TNF-α
was assessed using a high sensitivity Enzyme Linked Immunoassay (ELISA) kit (RD systems,
Minneapolis, MN). Plasma LPS was measured using a LAL chromogenic endotoxin quantita￾tion kit (Pierce Thermoscientific, Rockford, IL). Plasma 8,12-iso-Isoprostane F-2alpha-VI lev￾els was measured in butylated hydroxytoluene treated human plasma samples using LC-MS/
MS on Acquity UPLC-Xevo TQS (Waters, Milford, MA).

Stool collection
Patients who were enrolled in the inpatient setting provided stool samples in sterile stool hats
using a protocol similar to the Human Microbiome Project [10] After collection, stool samples
were stored at 4˚C andtransferred to the CUIMC Microbiome Core Lab within 12 hours.
Ambulatory patients were provided with a stool collection kit that included ice-packs and
FedEx return packaging during routine clinic visits. Stool samples were shipped to the Core
lab after collection by patients at home. In the Core lab, stool was processed, aliquoted and
stored at -80˚C. A total of 22 stool samples were collected.
DNA extraction
DNA was extracted from stool using the MagAttract PowerSoil DNA Kit on an Eppendorf
epMotion 5075 Liquid Handling Workstation.16S rRNA sequencing was performed on all
stool samples. For bacterial sequencing, we amplified the V3-V4 regions of the 16S rRNA gene
using standard primers with Illumina Nextera adaptors (Illumina, Madison WI). PCR prod￾ucts were purified using Agencourt AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, Jersey City, NJ) and
quantified using the Quant-iT Broad Range dsDNA Assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Wal￾tham, MA). Libraries were normalized and pooled with a 10% PhiX spike and sequenced on
an Illumina MiSeq with a v3 kit. Negative controls were included on all sequencing runs.
Statistical analysis
Demultiplexed sequence files were processed and operationalized in R version 3.5.2, using the
DADA2 pipeline (version 1.10.1) to identify exact sequence variants (ESVs) [11,12]. Reads
were truncated at forward and reverse lengths of 260 and 220. We utilized a published bioin￾formatics workflow that utilizes DADA2 to identify ‘exact sequence variants’ and assigned tax￾onomy using the Silva Projects version 128 release. Descriptive statistics for the numer of
sequence reads per sample were: minimum = 411, maximum = 43,775, median = 12,713,
mean = 15,361.95 ± 12455.97. 16S analyses were carried out–without filtering low prevalence
ESVs–using the Phyloseq package version 1.30.0. Alpha diversity (i.e., number and distribu￾tion of bacterial taxa within samples) was defined using the Shannon Index and the number of
observed ESVs (we present alpha diversity results based on both rarefied (400 sequence reads)
and nonrarefied data). We used a generalized linear regression model to regress Shannon
index on TAC group. The p-value was derived from the type III sum of squares F-value. Analy￾sis of beta diversity (i.e., microbial community membership similarity according to TAC dos￾ing requirements) utilized principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) of the Bray-Curtis
dissimilarity index and PCoA plots of the first 2 principal coordinates were plotted according
to TAC dosing requirements. PERMANOVA analysis was conducted to identify whether
patient categories explained variation in microbial communities and statistical significance
was determined using the Adonis test. The DESeq2 package [13] version 1.26.0 was used to
evaluate whether specific taxa (ESVs) differed by TAC dosing requirements. A false discovery
rate (FDR) was used to correct for multiple comparisons. DESeq2 analysis was also conducted
adjusting for body mass index (BMI). BMI was abstracted from medical records and dichoto￾mized as overweight and non-overweight, using a cut-off of 25 kg/m2
. Relative abundance of
the taxa found to be statistically significantly different by TAC dosing in both DESeq2 analyses
were presented. Microbiota diversity measures, phylum level relative abundance (arcsine
square root transformed) as well as biomarkers of endotoxemia, inflammation and oxidative
stress were regressed on TAC dosing requirements in generalized linear regression models.

Results
A total of 24 HT patients were included in this analysis: 22 had stool samples and TAC levels
collected, while 16 had at least one blood biomarker available. Baseline demographics and
background medication use were similar between the low- and high-dose groups, with the
exception of a slightly higher BMI in the low-dose group (Table 1). The average times from HT
to sample collections are summarized in S1 Table. The median TAC dose was 0.1 mg/kg/day,
while the median dose-normalized ratio was 100.01. The median TAC dose among below and
above median groups were 0.07 and 0.18 mg/kg/day, respectively. The median TAC levels
among below and above median groups were 65.6 and 166.3 ng/mL, respectively.

after rarefication were 4.62 and 169.14. The following results are based on nonrarefied data as
the rarefied and nonrarefied values were strongly correlated (p<0.0001) (S1 Fig). Patients in
the low-dose tacrolimus group had a significantly lower alpha diversity metrics (Shannon
index and # of observed ESVs) as compared to the high-dose group; these findings were consis￾tent when using both weight-based dosing (mg/kg/day) or the L/D ratio (Fig 1). These findings
were unchanged after adjusting for the difference in BMI using linear regression, and were
consistent between the rarified and non-rarified data (S2 and S3 Figs) Fig 2 visualizes variation
in microbial community composition (Beta diversity) between low- and high-dose cohorts by

significant (Fig 4). Results for other phyla are shown in Fig 3. We observed 37 taxa to be signif￾icantly enriched among patients in the high-dose group (all FDR<0.05), several of which are
potential short-chain fatty acid producers with anti-inflammatory properties, including taxa
from the genus Subgoligranulum, and the family Lachnospiraceae. We observed only 1 taxon,
belonging to the genus Bacteroides, to be enriched among patients in the low-dose group. After
adjustment for BMI, the results were even stronger with 335 taxa differing by TAC dosing
group. Findings were generally similar to unadjusted analyses in that several potentially anti￾inflammatory taxa, including the genus Akkermansia and family Rumninococcaceae, were ele￾vated in the high TAC dosing group. Relative abundances of the taxa that significantly differed
by TAC group in both analyses are displayed in Fig 5. DESEq2 results for the 38 taxa that dif￾fered in the unadjusted analysis are displayed in S2 Table.
Biomarkers of endotoxemia, inflammation and oxidative stress and TAC
dosing
Population mean values of LPS, TNF-α and 8,12-iso-isoprostane were 0.43, 1.38 and 94.24,
respectively. Above the median daily weight-based TAC dose was associated with higher gut
microbial alpha diversity (p = 0.03); concurrently, TNF-α and 8,12-iso-Isoprostane F-2alpha￾VI levels were lower and LPS levels were higher in the above median TAC group although
these findings were only marginally statistically significant and dependent on BMI adjustment
(Table 2). Measures of alpha diversity were inversely correlated with isoprostane and TNF￾alpha but positively correlated with LPS, although, despite strong correlations, none of these
associations were statistically significant in this small study (Table 3).
Discussion
In the present study, we examined the relationship between the metrics of gut microbial diver￾sity, levels of endotoxemia, inflammation and oxidative stress and TAC dosing requirements
after HT. Specifically, we found that higher TAC dosing requirements in the early (within the

first 3 months) post-HT period were associated with: 1) greater alpha diversity of gut micro￾biota, 2) higher abundance of specific taxa with potential anti-inflammatory properties, and 3)
lower biomarker levels of inflammation and oxidative stress, and higher endotoxemia,
although these latter findings were only marginally statistically significant and dependent on
BMI adjustment.
These findings build on prior research from our group that explored the variations in gut
microbial communities, endotoxemia and established biomarkers of inflammation and oxida￾tive stress in a large population of HF patients (NYHA Class I-IV) and after HT [9]. We found
that advanced HF patients (NYHA Class IV) had reduced levels of gut alpha diversity and
heightened levels of endotoxemia, inflammation and oxidative stress relative to less

symptomatic HF (NYHA Class I-III) patients. Treatment with HT did not appear to restore
gut diversity or improve levels of endotoxemia, while inflammation and oxidative stress were
reduced [9].
The gut microbiome is the community of microbes inhabiting the human gastrointestinal
tract, which contains nearly 2000 bacterial species [14]. In addition to host elimination path￾ways (i.e. liver metabolism and renal excretion), the gut microbiota also plays important roles
in drug metabolism through secretion of drug-metabolizing enzymes or microbiota-host co￾metabolism. While the impact of gut microbiota on drug metabolism has been investigated for
decades, data are only available for about 40 drugs or natural products [15]. Previous research
has implicated the gut microbiome in the co-metabolism of various non-transplant medica￾tions, including acetaminophen, digoxin, simvastatin, and omeprazole [15]. However, data
examining the potential impact of the gut microbiome on immunosuppressive medications
like TAC in the post-transplant setting are sparse.
Lee et al. evaluated the relationship between the gut microbiome and TAC dosing in 19 kid￾ney transplant recipients [8]. In their analysis, patients who required a 50% increase in TAC
dose during the first post-transplant month (n = 5) were compared to patients with stable
TAC doses. This study found that the Shannon diversity index was similar between the two
groups (3.5±0.8 versus 3.5±0.5; p = 0.78), as were measures of beta-diversity. However, these
authors identified that abundance of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii was higher in the dose-esca￾lation group when compared to the stable dose patients (11.8 versus 0.8%, respectively;
p = 0.002). This finding is relevant as this organism is known to produce a significant amount
of butyrate, which is a major energy source for intestinal cells, is readily absorbed by intestinal
epithelial cells, and is implicated in the maintenance of colonic mucosal health [16, 17]. This
species may also possess anti-inflammatory properties, as a decrease in Faecalibacterium
prausnitzii has been associated with inflammatory bowel disease [18]. Unfortunately, this
study did not evaluate serum inflammatory markers, hence we cannot directly assess if a rela￾tionship between gut dysbiosis and systemic inflammation existed in this cohort of renal trans￾plant recipients.
Contrary to the analysis by Lee et al., we identified an association between TAC dosing
requirements and alpha diversity as measured by both the Shannon index and the number of
observed ESVs. Our positive findings may diverge from Lee et al.’s due to our larger sample
size, or from inherent differences in the study design or patient population (i.e. kidney versus
HT). Regardless, our study is the first to associate lower TAC dosing requirements with gut
dysbiosis in the early post-HT period. In addition to enhanced measures of community diver￾sity, we identified 38 specific taxa that were differentially abundant in patients with higher
TAC dosing requirements. Among these is the genus Subdoligranulum, which is closely related
to Faecalibacterium prausnitzii [19]. This finding is relevant in light of the aforementioned sal￾utary properties of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, and it suggests a possible connection between
higher abundance of Subdoligranulum and the lower levels of inflammation and oxidative
stress that we found in our high-dose patients.
We posit that several mechanisms may explain the link between gut dysbiosis and TAC dos￾ing requirements post-HT. Global disturbances in the richness and evenness of the gut micro￾biome—which have been demonstrated in transplant patients with diarrhea—may result in
significant derangements in intestinal CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein activity and subsequent
reductions in TAC dosing requirements [5]. It is also possible that increased gut diversity may
increase TAC dosing requirements, as drug absorption and/or metabolism may be directly
linked to a healthy colonic mucosa requiring butyrate from bacterial sources like Faecalibacter￾ium prausnitzii and Subdoligranulum. Interestingly, a follow up analysis from the study by Lee
et al. [8] found that Faecalibacterium prausnitzii can produce a unique metabolite of TAC,

which suggests gut bacterial metabolism as a previously unrecognized drug elimination route
[20]. While all of these postulates are intriguing, further study is required to elucidate the rea￾sons for the relationship between the gut microbiome and TAC dosing requirements.
Our study has several noteworthy limitations. First, this is a cross-sectional analysis, and
longitudinal trends in the relationship between gut microbiome dysbiosis and TAC dosing
requirements were not assessed. While our core hypothesis is that the gut microbiota influ￾ences the metabolism of TAC, it is also possible that this drug may influence gut microbiota

similar (165 and 188, respectively).

composition as has been suggested in animal models [6,7]. Second, although our two groups
were well matched with respect to demographics and background medical history, we did not
genotype patients for polymorphisms in CYP3A5, which can significantly alter the pharmaco￾kinetics of TAC. Third, no diet or other behavioral variables were collected among the patients
enrolled, hence we cannot determine whether dietary habits contributed to the gut micro￾biome profile observed in our study. Dietary assessments should be included in future studies
aiming to provide knowledge on habitual dietary intake over a longer period. Nevertheless, the
likelihood that behavioral variables would have a meaningful influence of TAC dosing is low,
thus reducing the potential that unmeasured behaviors confounded our results. Also, we did
not administer the Bristol stool scale during stool/blood sample collection; therefore, we are
unable to comment on presence or absence of diarrhea and its impact on TAC dosing. How￾ever, we wish to point out that diarrhea is likely a consequence (and not a cause) of the altered
microbiome. Finally, although this is the largest known dataset of post-transplant patients
exploring this topic, we recognize that this is still a pilot study with a relatively small sample
size.
In conclusion, we have observed an association between gut alpha diversity and TAC dos￾ing requirements early after HT. Future studies are needed to validate this relationship longitu￾dinally in the post-transplant setting. Additionally, data demonstrating that pre-transplant
microbial composition is related to post-transplant TAC dosing requirements would be of
high clinical utility. If such an association were established, the pre-operative gut microbiome
could be potentially integrated with demographic and genetic variables to better guide post￾operative TAC dosing in HT recipients.
