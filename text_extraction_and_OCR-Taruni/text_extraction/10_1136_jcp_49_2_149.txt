Pathology of deaths associated with "ecstasy"
and "eve" misuse
C M Milroy, J C Clark, A R W Forrest
Abstract
Aims-To study the postmortem patho￾logy associated with ring substituted am￾phetamine (amphetamine derivatives)
misuse.
Methods-The postmortem findings in
deaths associated with the ring substituted
amphetamines 3,4-methylenedioxymethyl￾amphetamine (MDMA, ecstasy) and 3,4-
methylenedioxyethylamphetamine (MDEA,
eve) were studied in seven young white
men aged between 20 and 25 years.
Results-Striking changes were identified
in the liver, which varied from foci of in￾dividual cell necrosis to centrilobular
necrosis. In one case there was massive
hepatic necrosis. Changes consistent with
catecholamine induced myocardial dam￾age were seen in five cases. In the brain
perivascular haemorrhagic and hypoxic
changes were identified in four cases.
Overall, the changes in four cases were
the same as those reported in heat stroke,
although only two cases had a documented
history of hyperthermia. Of these four
cases, all had changes in their liver, three
had changes in their brains, and three in
their heart. Of the other three cases, one
man died of fulninant liver failure, one of
water intoxication and one probably from
a cardiac arrhythmia associated with myo￾cardial fibrosis.
Conclusions-These data suggest that
there is more than one mechanism ofdam￾age in ring substituted amphetamine mis￾use, injury being caused by hyperthermia
in some cases, but with ring substituted
amphetamines also possibly having a toxic
effect on the liver and other organs in the
absence of hyperthermia.

Recreational use of 3,4-methylenedioxy￾methylamphetamine (MDMA), more com￾monly known as "ecstasy" (and a variety of
other names including "XTC", "Adam" or
"E"), is now well established. In Britain up￾wards of 500 000 people are said to use the drug
each week (Harris Poll (1992) for "Reportage",
BBC2, 22 Jan 1993).
MDMA is a ring substituted amphetamine
with psychoactive properties. First synthesised
in 1914 from methylenedioxyamphetamine
(MDA), itself a drug of misuse (known as the
"love drug"), it has been used in psychotherapy
and was originally used as an appetite sup￾pressant. The drug has ceased to be used me￾dicinally and is now an established part of
the illegal drug scene. It is banned in most
countries. In the UK it is a class A drug as
defined in Schedule 2 of the Misuse of Drugs
Act 1971. It has no medicinal use in the UK
and cannot be prescribed. As well as MDA
and MDMA, another variant, methylene￾dioxyethylamphetamine (MDEA, known as
"eve"), which is similarly proscribed, is com￾monly encountered. All have similar phar￾macological effects.
In the UK, MDMA is often taken by young
people at discos and rave parties. Both involve
dancing, but especially at the latter there is
vigorous repetitive dancing in crowded rooms
with a hot and humid atmosphere. The dangers
of this activity are recognised to a certain extent
as rooms to "chill out" are often available for
people to rest in after periods of exertion. Toxic
effects and the occasional death following ring
substituted amphetamine misuse have been re￾ported but postmortem data are lacking.'-26 In
this paper we report on deaths associated with
ring substituted amphetamine misuse and de￾tail the postmortem findings.
Methods
Seven deaths have been investigated by the
University of Sheffield Department of Forensic
Pathology in the past three years, which were
associated with ring substituted amphetamine
misuse. One case has been reported pre￾viously.26 Case details are presented in table 1.
All of the subjects were white men, between
20 and 25 years of age. Three of the victims
collapsed at a rave or disco, two were found in
bed, one in a collapsed state and one dead, one
collapsed in the street, and one was admitted to
hospital with progressive jaundice.
Only two of the men had documented hy￾perthermia, with temperatures of 44°C and
39 5°C. One of the deaths was thought to have
been caused by water intoxication, the victim
having drunk an estimated 14 litres of water in
trying to quench the thirst that is frequently
associated with ingestion of ring substituted
amphetamines. None of the men were known
intravenous drug abusers.
Full drug screening was performed on body
fluids, including a screen for drugs of abuse.
Screening by gas chromatography/mass spec￾troscopy was also performed.

Liver
The liver showed dramatic changes. Necrosis
was seen in all cases. In one case there was
centrilobular and midzonal necrosis (fig 1).
This patient survived for four days. In the other
cases focal necrosis in zone 3 was present, with
an acute inflammatory response surrounding
necrotic hepatocytes (fig 2). Fatty change, si￾nusoidal dilatation and inflammation were also
identified. No other hepatic pathology was
identified in these cases. Postmortem virology
was not done in these cases. In case 7 there
was massive hepatic necrosis, with the liver
only weighing 795 g at necropsy. Full viral
screening was negative in this case. The livers
were of normal size in the other cases.

midzonal necrosis following ingestion of "ecstasy".
Heart
Changes were seen in five of the seven hearts
examined. Histologically, the changes ranged
from contraction band necrosis to individual
myocyte necrosis with a surrounding neutrophil
and macrophage inflammatory response; the
same changes as have been described in ca￾techolamine induced myocardial injury (fig 3).
In one case foci of fibrosis were identified in
the heart of a man in whom traces of MDMA
and MDA were found in the urine.
Brain
The brain of one of the cases of rapid death
showed disseminated intravascular coagulation
(DIC), oedema and degeneration of neurones,
particularly apparent in the locus ceruleus. Two
cases showed foci of haemorrhage (fig 4). One
case showed severe cerebral oedema consistent
with water intoxication and had additional oc￾casional perivascular haemorrhages.
Other organs
Pulmonary infarction was seen in case 5. In
two of the other rapid deaths intra-alveolar
haemorrhage was present. In one case there
was inhalation ofgastric contents. In the patient
who died of water intoxication there was com￾plete necrosis of the pituitary gland. Severe
cerebral oedema was present and the pituitary
necrosis was probably a direct consequence of
this as the blood supply was compromised.
In two cases the kidneys were examined for
myoglobin, which was not detected. No skeletal
muscle damage was identified.
TOXICOLOGY
The toxicological data are shown in table 1.
MDMA was found in five cases, varying from
trace concentrations to 4-2 mg/l. MDEA was
found in two cases, at concentrations of 3-5
and 0 187 mg/I. Amphetamines were detected
in three cases at concentrations of 0256, 0453

and 1-4 mg/l. MDA was found in three cases,
varying from trace concentrations to 8-5 mg/l.
MDA is a metabolite of MDMA and MDEA,
but may also be found as a constituent of
"ecstasy" tablets, along with other phar￾macological substances including am￾phetamines (vide infra). No opiates or other
drugs associated with intravenous drug abuse
were detected.
Discussion
Ring substituted amphetamines (amphetamine
derivatives) are taken because they give a feeling
of euphoria and benevolence and heighten the
sensations at raves and discos. However, when
29 volunteers took MDMA, as well as pleasant
symptoms, all complained of undesirable
effects which included loss of appetite, trismus
and bruxism, nausea, muscle aches, stiffness,
and ataxia." Sweating, tachycardia and hy￾pertension, insomnia, and fatigue were also
reported. More serious complications reported
include hyperthermia, convulsions, other
cardiac arrhythmias, rhabdomyolysis, dis￾seminated intravascular coagulation, renal fail￾ure, hyponatraemia, hepatoxicity, pneumo￾mediastinum, aplastic anaemia, cerebral
infarction, cerebral haemorrhage, and cerebral
venous sinus thrombosis.'-26
In five of the cases reported here com￾plications followed shortly after ingestion. Four
of these deaths seem to be linked directly to
the toxic effects of MDMA and MDEA. In the
fifth case there was evidence of water in￾toxication, which followed the taking of "ec￾stasy". In this case, however, myocardial and
liver pathology was identified which was similar
to the other cases. The sixth case collapsed in
the street. Myocardial fibrosis and foci of liver
necrosis were identified and toxicology revealed
traces of MDMA.
MDMA is believed to act on at least three
neurotransmitter pathways, as does cocaine,
but with MDMAthe serotoninergic (5-hydroxy￾tryptamine) pathway is principally affected,
which would account for the more pronounced
effect on mood. Cocaine acts chiefly on the
dopaminergic system, which accounts for its
greater addictive properties. MDMA also acts
on the noradrenergic system. Serotonin plays a
major role in thermoregulation and interference
with this mechanism is believed to be the cause
of the hyperthermia which arises as a com￾plication of ring substituted amphetamine mis￾use. Stimulation of the noradrenergic system
also probably contributes to hyperthermia.
Hyperthermia may account for many of the
changes seen in deaths from ring substituted
amphetamine misuse, although it is interesting
to note that raised temperatures were only
documented in two of our cases.
The pathology of heatstroke has been re￾ported in a number of papers.28-34 In the liver
the most striking change is centrilobular nec￾rosis. Sinusoidal congestion and dilatation, and
portal and sinusoidal inflammation may be
present. Fatty change has been reported oc￾casionally. Cholestasis may be present, espe￾cially in fatal cases. Rubel and Ishak34 did
not find liver necrosis as frequently as other
authors. They examined the liver in 50 military
recruits who had died ofheatstroke. These men
were predominantly white. Kew et al" had
found liver necrosis a common finding in black
South African gold miners. The difference in
frequency may be related to the fact that the
gold miners work in very high environmental
temperatures with over 90% humidity, con￾ditions not dissimilar to some raves and discos.
In the myocardium contraction band nec￾rosis and small foci of necrosis with a mixed
inflammatory infiltrate are seen. These features
are also evident in catecholamine induced in￾jury. In the brain ring haemorrhages and hyp￾151

oxic changes have been described. The kidneys
may show acute tubular necrosis and pul￾monary haemorrhage is common.
The mechanism of damage in heatstroke is
postulated to be caused by circulatory collapse
and hypoxic damage, possibly combined with
disseminated intravascular coagulopathy,
which has been recorded in heatstroke,3637 and
as a complication of MDMA and amphetamine
ingestion.37 In the myocardium the damage
may be related to catecholamine induced in￾jury. These myocardial changes are also seen
secondary to brain pathology, and contraction
band necrosis may be seen in resuscitation,
especially when catecholamines are used.
Whilst these are altemrative explanations for
the changes seen, not everyone was re￾suscitated, and the myocardial changes are fre￾quently seen, even in early deaths.
The pathological changes present in these
deaths are the same as those seen in deaths
from heatstroke. These changes provide further
evidence that hyperthermia can cause death
following misuse of ring substituted am￾phetamines. Evidence of disseminated intra￾vascular coagulopathy was also present in the
brain. These deaths may therefore be a com￾plication of hyperthermia, DIC and shock.
Some caution must be exercised, however, in
ascribing a death from ring substituted am￾phetamine misuse to these mechanisms as a
high temperature is not recorded in all cases,
although hyperpyrexia may have been present
at some time.
In the seventh case death was caused by
fulminant liver failure and postmortem ex￾amination revealed massive hepatic necrosis.
All investigations for the cause of liver failure
were negative. The young man admitted to
regular and heavy ecstasy use, and this case is
similar to cases described by Henry et al.7
There is increasing evidence that "ecstasy" is
hepatotoxic, and liver changes have been re￾ported following biopsy.'01' These changes,
however, differed from those found in the acute
deaths described above. Whether the damage
is caused by an idiosyncratic reaction to
MDMA, or a contaminant of the drug is un￾clear. Therefore, there seems to be a second
mechanism for liver injury from ring substituted
amphetamines unrelated to hyperthermia. Fur￾thermore, the possibility that the myocardium
may also be damaged by these drugs without
documented hyperthermia is suggested by case
6 and other reports, where myocardial fibrosis
has been reported following misuse of
MDMA.3
Individual susceptibility to ring substituted
amphetamines may be related to its metabolism

Pathology of deaths associated with "ecstasy" and "eve" misuse
in the liver. Abnormalities have been reported
in demethylation in susceptible individuals, re￾lated to human debrisoquine hydroxylase
(CYP2D6).` Another problem for the re￾creational drug taker is the quality of the tablets
they take. Examination of "ecstasy" tablets by
one of the authors (ARWF) has shown that the
contents of the tablets vary greatly, and may
be a mixture of MDA, MDMA, MDEA, am￾phetamines, or no pharmacologically active
substance; compounds such as potassium
chlorate may also be found (table 2). With such
material the possibility of toxic contaminants
being present is evident.
The short term risks of "ecstasy" use are
becoming increasingly more apparent and
questions must be asked about the long term
effects on the brain, liver and heart considering
the pathology found in those who die.
