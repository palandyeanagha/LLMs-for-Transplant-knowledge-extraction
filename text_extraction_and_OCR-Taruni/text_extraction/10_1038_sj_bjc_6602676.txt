Activation of the endothelin A receptor (ETA) by endothelin-1 (ET-1) mediates events that regulate mitogenesis, apoptosis,
angiogenesis and metastasis in tumours. Specific blockade of ETA may have anticancer effects, while retaining beneficial endothelin B
receptor (ETB)-mediated effects such as apoptosis and clearance of ET-1. ZD4054 is an orally active, specific ETA antagonist in clinical
development. In receptor-binding studies, ZD4054 specifically bound to ETA with high affinity; no binding was detected at ETB. In a
randomised placebo-controlled trial in eight healthy volunteers, a single oral dose of ZD4054 reduced forearm vasoconstriction in
response to brachial artery infusion of ET-1, thus providing clinical evidence of ETA blockade. ETB blockade was assessed in an
ascending, single-dose, placebo-controlled trial in 28 volunteers. For all doses of ZD4054, mean plasma ET-1 concentrations
measured at 4 and 24 h were within the placebo reference range (a rise in ET-1 would indicate ETB blockade) and there was no
evidence of dose-related changes. These data confirm the specificity of ZD4054 for ETA, with no activity at ETB in a clinical or
preclinical setting. As a result of this specificity, ZD4054 has the potential to block multiple ETA-induced pathological processes, while
allowing beneficial ETB-mediated processes to continue, which may, in turn, lead to an effective cancer therapy.

There is accumulating evidence to suggest that endothelins,
particularly endothelin-1 (ET-1), have a role in regulating the
growth and proliferation of tumours (Nelson et al, 2003). ET-1,
produced by tumour cells, exerts its effects primarily by binding to
G-protein-coupled receptors on the cell surface (endothelin A
receptor (ETA) and B receptor (ETB)) (Nelson et al, 2003) and
modifying the effects of other growth factors (Nelson et al, 1995).
Binding of ET-1 to ETA and ETB causes distinct and opposing
effects on cell growth and survival. In most cells, activation of ETA
promotes cell growth (Nelson et al, 2003), whereas activation of
ETB induces cell death via apoptosis (Okazawa et al, 1998). In
addition, binding of ET-1 to ETB results in clearance of ET-1 from
the circulation. Overexpression of ETA has been reported in a
variety of human tumours and human cancer cell lines, including
the prostate, ovary, lung, colon, kidney, cervix and bone (Nelson
et al, 2003). Conversely, ETB expression is reduced in the majority
of solid tumours, but is still evident (Nelson et al, 2003). The
balance of ETA and ETB activation in tumour cells appears to be
important in progression of most cancers (Nelson et al, 2003),
especially prostate cancer (Kopetz et al, 2002). Increased expres￾sion of ETA relative to ETB could contribute to increased tumour
cell survival and growth.
Activation of ETA by ET-1 is reported to result in a number of
events involved in the malignant process, including regulating
mitogenesis, apoptosis, angiogenesis and tumour metastasis. It
triggers a signalling cascade involving growth factors such as
epidermal growth factor and insulin-like growth factor-1 (Pirts￾khalaishvili and Nelson, 2000), kinases including protein kinase C
and mitogen-activated protein kinase (Bagnato et al, 1997; Bagnato
and Catt, 1998), and induction of immediate-early response genes
(c-fos, c-jun and c-myc) that promote cell growth and mitogenesis
(Battistini et al, 1993). Additionally, apoptosis induced by
cytotoxic agents is inhibited (Del Bufalo et al, 2002) and
angiogenesis promoted (via a vascular endothelial growth factor
(VEGF)-mediated mechanism) by activation of ETA (Spinella et al,
2002; Bagnato and Spinella, 2003). The role of ETA in mediating
increased proliferation, resistance to apoptosis and survival of
tumour cells, and increased angiogenesis – a process central to
tumour growth – makes ETA an attractive target for cancer
therapy.
In addition to a role in growth and survival of primary tumours,
ETA is an attractive target to prevent the spread and survival of
tumour metastases. Activation of ETA induces the expression and
activation of tumour proteases (matrix metalloproteinases and
urokinase plasminogen activator) that facilitate tumour spread and
metastasis (Rosano` et al, 2001). Furthermore, activation of ETA
leads to proliferation of osteoblasts, bone remodelling and release
of growth factors that stimulate survival and growth of metastatic
tumour cells (Nelson et al, 1999) within prostate cancer metastases
in bone. These findings have led to extensive research into the
endothelin receptors as a target for anticancer therapies.
Specific blockade of ETA may offer an effective cancer therapy,
since the anticancer effects of endothelin antagonists appear to be
mediated via ETA blockade. In contrast, antagonism of ETB may
lead to undesirable effects, such as inhibition of apoptosis and

the ETA (i.e. a specific ETA antagonist) would be desirable in an
oncology setting. Atrasentan (Abbott Laboratories) is a selective
ETA antagonist currently in development which, while selectively
binding to ETA, also exhibits antagonism of ETB (Nelson, 2003),
leading to increased plasma ET-1 levels (Carducci et al, 2002;
Nelson, 2003). These findings are consistent with the binding
affinities reported for atrasentan (0.034 and 63.3 nM for ETA and
ETB, respectively). ZD4054 (AstraZeneca) is an orally active ETA
antagonist in early clinical development for the treatment of
cancer, which has recently been granted fast-track status by the
FDA. The synthesis and molecular characterisation of ZD4054, a
nonpeptide ETA antagonist, has been described previously (Brad￾bury et al, 1997). ZD4054 binds to ETA with high affinity and has
no detectable affinity for ETB. In preclinical studies, ZD4054
specifically inhibits ETA-mediated antiapoptotic effects, but not
ETB-mediated proapoptotic effects in human smooth muscle cells
(Curtis et al, 2004; Dreicer et al, 2005), blocks ETA-mediated
activation of p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase in murine
osteoblast cells and inhibits ET-1 induced proliferation of human
immature pre-osteoblast cells (Curtis et al, 2005). Importantly,
ZD4054 inhibits growth of tumour xenografts in mice and
enhances the cytotoxicity of paclitaxel in ovarian carcinoma in
vitro and in vivo (Rosano` et al, 2005). This paper reports the
results of studies that were conducted to confirm the specificity of
ZD4054 for ETA in a clinical setting.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Receptor-binding assays
The inhibition by ZD4054 (varying concentrations) of 125iodine￾ET-1 binding to cloned human ETA and ETB was assessed using
standard radioligand-binding techniques. Human recombinant
ETA or ETB was expressed in mouse erythroleukaemic cells, and
cell membranes prepared for competitive binding studies using
125iodine-ET-1 as the radioligand. Incubations were carried out in
triplicate in the presence of ZD4054, 100 pM to 100 mM in half-log
increments, and inhibition of ET-1 binding was expressed as the
geometric mean pIC50 value (concentration to inhibit 50% of
binding) with a 95% confidence interval (CI). The affinity of
ZD4054 for cloned human ETA was also assessed – using the
equation of Cheng and Prusoff (1973) to determine the equilibrium
dissociation constant (Ki)– in a further receptor-binding screen
utilising a greater number of concentration– response curves
determined in three separate studies.
Healthy volunteer study of forearm vasoconstriction to
assess interaction with ETA
ET-1 causes vasoconstriction predominantly by activation of ETA
on vascular smooth muscle (Spratt et al, 2001). Therefore,
inhibition of ET-1-induced vasoconstriction, measured by venous
occlusion plethysmography (Wilkinson and Webb, 2001), would
provide clinical evidence of ETA blockade.
A single-dose, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomised
trial was undertaken in eight healthy adult male volunteers to
study the effect of ZD4054 on ET-1-mediated forearm vasocon￾striction. All volunteers had previously demonstrated a mean 25–
75% reduction in forearm blood flow (measured using standard
strain gauge venous occlusion plethysmography) in response to a
120-min brachial artery infusion of ET-1. The effects of two oral
doses of ZD4054 (10 and 30 mg) on ET-1-induced vasoconstriction
were compared with placebo. Over nonconsecutive days, each
volunteer received both doses of ZD4054 and placebo. The study
was limited to two active doses and placebo due to the invasive
nature and high technical difficulty of the brachial artery infusions
and forearm vasoconstriction assessment. A 120-min brachial
artery infusion of ET-1 (2.5 pmol min1
) was given to resting
subjects, commencing 2 h after dosing with ZD4054 or placebo.
The degree of forearm vasoconstriction measured between 90 and
120 min of the infusion (at 10-min intervals over a 30-min period)
was compared between dose groups. The summary measure for
statistical analyses was the percentage change in forearm blood
flow. This measure was derived from the change from baseline
(immediately prior to ET-1 infusion) in the mean area under the
effect curve (forearm blood flow response) from 90 to 120 min
(AUEC90120) relative to the noninfused arm for each volunteer at
each dose level vs placebo. Previous studies have shown that
AUEC90120 represents the most sensitive measure of ETA
antagonism as ET-1-induced vasoconstriction is usually maximal
after 90 min (Strachan et al, 2002). Treatment and dose effects were
compared using analysis of variance (ANOVA), fitting effects for
subject and dose level.
Healthy volunteer study of plasma ET-1 levels to assess
interaction with ETB
A randomised, ascending, single-dose, double-blind, placebo￾controlled study was undertaken in 28 healthy adult male
volunteers. Oral doses of ZD4054 evaluated were 2.5, 10, 20, 30,
60, 120, 150 and 240 mg, with dose escalation continued based on
tolerability until the maximum tolerated dose had been defined.
The planned dose escalation sequence was from 120 to 240 mg
ZD4054. However, the 240 mg dose was not tolerated; so the dose
of 150 mg ZD4054 was investigated to further define the maximum
tolerated dose. Volunteers were randomised approximately 3 : 1 to
ZD4054 or placebo on each study day. Each cohort of volunteers
was dosed consecutively on three separate study days, with a
minimum of 14 days between doses in the same group. Doses of
ZD4054 given were: group 1 (n ¼ 9) 2.5, 60 and 150 mg; group 2
(n ¼ 9) 10, 20 and 120 mg; group 3 (n ¼ 10) 30 and 240 mg. Blood
samples were collected for measurement of plasma ET-1 (and its
precursor, Big-ET-1), at baseline and at 4 and 24 h post-dose. An
increase in ET-1 was taken as evidence of ETB blockade. ET-1 and
big ET were extracted from plasma using an acetic acid extraction
technique described by Rolinski et al (1994). Concentrations of
ET-1 and big ET-1 in the extract were determined by radio￾immunoassay using a methodology based on commercially
available assay kits (Peninsula Laboratories Inc., San Carlos, CA,
USA). Briefly, 100 ml of standard, sample or control was incubated
with the appropriate antibody overnight. Samples were incubated
with a known concentration of radio-labelled ET-1 or big ET-1 for
a further 16 h and the immune complexes were precipitated with
Amerlext (Amersham Plc, Amersham, UK) donkey anti-rabbit
antibody. The sensitivities of the assays, defined as two standard
deviations above the zero binding, were 0.25 pg ml1 for ET-1 and
1 pg ml1 for big ET-1.
Both clinical studies were approved by an Independent Ethics
Committee and all subjects gave written informed consent. The
study was performed in accordance with ethical principles
originating in the Declaration of Helsinki and consistent with
ICH/Good Clinical Practice, applicable regulatory requirements
and AstraZeneca’s policy on bioethics.
RESULTS
Receptor-binding assays
ZD4054 potently inhibited the binding of 125iodine-ET-1 to cloned
human ETA expressed in mouse erythroleukaemic cells, showing
that ZD4054 has high affinity for ETA. The pIC50 for ZD4054 at the
ETA (geometric mean) was 8.27 nM (95% CI: 8.23, 8.32 nM) (n ¼ 4).
Displacement curves were normal, with slopes close to unity. In the

were 22, 27 and 13 nM (mean value 21 nM) (Table 1). The Ki values
measured in the same studies were 13, 17 and 8 nM (mean value
13 nM).
In contrast, ZD4054 had no measurable affinity for cloned
human ETB, with a mean displacement of only 1.270.7% (n ¼ 3) of 125iodine-ET-1 at a concentration of 100 mM ZD4054. This level of
displacement is within the background range and is likely to be
caused by assay variability. In the multi-receptor-binding screen,
ZD4054 was inactive at ETB at a concentration of 10 mM (Table 1).
These data show that ZD4054 is a high-affinity ligand for ETA,
with no measurable affinity for ETB.
Healthy volunteer study of forearm vasoconstriction to
assess interaction with ETA
In volunteers given placebo, forearm blood flow was reduced by
approximately 40% in response to brachial artery infusion of ET-1.
ZD4054 inhibited this response to ET-1 (Figure 1A). The mean
AUEC(90120 min) corresponding to the forearm blood flow for each
dose and placebo is shown in Table 2 and the AUEC(90120 min) for
individual patients at each dose level is shown in Figure 1B to
illustrate the variability between individual volunteers. Adminis￾tration of ZD4054 (10 or 30 mg; combined data) produced a
statistically significant absolute reduction in vasoconstriction of
18.8% (P ¼ 0.021) when compared to placebo. Pairwise compar￾ison showed that administration of ZD4054 (30 mg) produced a
statistically significant absolute reduction in vasoconstriction of
23.7% (P ¼ 0.0125), representing a 63% decrease in vasoconstric￾tion relative to placebo. ZD4054 (10 mg) resulted in a numerical
decrease in vasoconstriction compared with placebo, which did
not reach statistical significance (P ¼ 0.10). Peak plasma concen￾trations were reached by 1.75 and 2.5 h post-dosing and the mean
plasma half-life of ZD4054 was 9.10 and 9.65 h for the 10 and 30 mg
doses, respectively.
These results provide evidence that ZD4054 is an ETA antagonist
in healthy volunteers.

Clinical Studies

Healthy volunteer study of plasma ET-1 levels to assess
interaction with ETB
Following administration of ZD4054 (2.5 –240 mg), mean values
for plasma ET-1 were within the placebo range at both 4 and 24 h
post-dose (Figures 2A and B). The placebo range was defined by
the 2.5 and 97.5% percentiles of the pre-dose and placebo (drug
naı¨ve) samples. Within this study, ZD4054 was well-tolerated at
single doses up to and including 120 mg; dose escalation was
limited by headache, nausea and vomiting. Based on a rise in mean
ET-1 values (Figures 2A and B) or percentage change from baseline
(data not shown), there was no evidence of a dose-related response
across the 2.5–240 mg (twice the maximum well-tolerated dose)
dose range tested. Since peak plasma concentrations of ZD4054
were reached by approximately 2 h post-dose, any impact on ET-1
clearance and plasma concentration of ET-1 can be expected to be
detectable at 4 h post-dose. However, no consistent profile was
observed when comparing the 4- and 24-h time points at each dose
(Figures 2A or B). Similarly, there was no evidence of an increase
in levels of Big ET-1, the precursor for ET-1 (data not shown).
These data, showing the inability of ZD4054 to alter plasma
concentrations of ET-1 (a biomarker of ETB blockade in vivo
(Strachan et al, 1999)) in healthy volunteers, demonstrate the
specificity of ZD4054 for ETA in a clinical setting.
DISCUSSION
Studies have shown that activation of ETA by ET-1 results in a
number of events that promote cell growth and mitogenesis
(Battistini et al, 1993; Bagnato et al, 1997; Bagnato and Catt, 1998;
Pirtskhalaishvili and Nelson, 2000), inhibit apoptosis induced by
cytotoxic agents (Del Bufalo et al, 2002) and facilitate angiogenesis
(Spinella et al, 2002; Bagnato and Spinella, 2003). Activation of ETA
by ET-1 also induces tumour proteases that facilitate tumour
metastasis (Rosano` et al, 2001), and causes proliferation of
osteoblasts, bone remodelling and release of growth factors that
stimulate survival and growth of metastatic tumour cells (Nelson
et al, 1999). As a result, ETA is an attractive target for cancer
therapy. Specific blockade of ETA has the potential to mediate
anticancer effects, while allowing beneficial effects such as apoptosis
and clearance of ET-1 that are mediated by ETB to proceed.
Results of the in vitro binding studies presented here show
ZD4054 to be a potent and specific ETA antagonist, exhibiting
high-affinity binding to ETA, with no measurable affinity for ETB at
a concentration of 10 mM. These results are consistent with
previously reported molecular characterisation (Bradbury et al,
1997), and the results of functional assays showing that ZD4054
specifically inhibited ETA-mediated antiapoptotic effects, but not
ETB-mediated proapoptotic effects, in human and rat smooth
muscle cells (Curtis et al, 2004; Dreicer et al, 2005).
The experimental forearm vasoconstriction model is currently
accepted as a standard technique for the investigation of vascular
pharmacology and the impact of intra-arterial drug infusion in
man (Wilkinson and Webb, 2001). Results using this model show
ZD4054 to be a pharmacologically active ETA antagonist, acting in
a dose-related manner to reduce ET-1-induced vasoconstriction.
This vasoconstriction is mediated primarily by ET-1 selective,
vascular smooth muscle ETA (Spratt et al, 2001). Although these
results clearly demonstrate ETA antagonism in vivo, they do not
give any information regarding the affinity of ZD4054 for ETB.
Thus, a further volunteer study was undertaken to explore the
specificity of ZD4054 for ETA.
In healthy volunteers, the concentration of circulating ET-1 has
been established as a biomarker of ETB blockade in vivo (Strachan
et al, 1999). In this setting, a rise in plasma ET-1, particularly
without an accompanying rise in Big ET-1, indicates ETB
inhibition. In the healthy volunteer study reported here, no
evidence of ZD4054-induced ETB inhibition was detected; mean
plasma levels of ET-1, at all doses of ZD4054, were within the
placebo range at 4 and 24 h post-dose. No clinically significant rise
in plasma ET-1 was observed when ZD4054 was given at doses up
to 240 mg (twice the maximum tolerated dose). Furthermore, there
was no evidence of a dose-related response based on a rise in mean
ET-1 or percentage change from baseline. These data provide
evidence that single doses of the ETA antagonist ZD4054 do not
inhibit clearance of ET-1, and therefore that ZD4054 does not
inhibit ETB in man. Through its specificity for ETA, ZD4054 may
offer advantages over other less specific ETA antagonists in the
oncology setting. Any degree of binding to ETB has the potential to
reduce the efficacy of ETA blockade strategies, both directly
through inhibition of ETB-mediated apoptosis and indirectly by
reduction of ET-1 clearance, leading to a rise in levels of the ETA
ligand, ET-1. Treatment with the selective ETA antagonist
atrasentan (10 mg once daily for 28 days) resulted in a significant
increase in plasma ET-1 levels in a study of patients with refractory
adenocarcinomas (Carducci et al, 2002). Plasma levels of ET-1 rose
linearly with increasing dose of atrasentan (dose range evaluated,
10–75 mg). This increase in plasma levels of ET-1 suggests reduced
clearance of ET-1, an effect that could impair the efficacy of any
ETA-blocking strategy. The authors hypothesised that the rise in
plasma ET-1 reported with atrasentan was the result of direct ETA
blockade (Carducci et al, 2002). Although it is difficult to
extrapolate between patients and healthy volunteers, evidence
from the present study shows that blockade of ETA by ZD4054,
which has no detectable affinity for ETB (at a concentration of
10 mM), does not result in elevated plasma levels of ET-1.
Furthermore, the ability of atrasentan to increase plasma levels
of ET-1 has been attributed to blockade of ETB (Nelson, 2003) and
suggests that the system is highly sensitive to ETB blockade. To our
knowledge, ZD4054 is the only endothelin receptor antagonist in
clinical development that targets ETA and does not inhibit ETB at
doses under clinical investigation.
In conclusion, volunteer studies and pre-clinical receptor-binding
studies confirm that ZD4054 is a potent antagonist of ETA, with no
evidence of ETB blockade at doses upto 240 mg in volunteers and at
10 mM in vitro. This lack of affinity for ETB suggests that ZD4054 has
the potential to block the multiple pathological processes in
malignancy that are mediated by ETA, while allowing the beneficial
processes mediated by ETB, such as apoptosis and clearance of ET￾1, to proceed. Further studies to assess the clinical impact of specific
ETA inhibition by ZD4054 in patients with cancer are ongoing.
