Abstract
Soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) in endothelial cells determines the plasma concentrations of epoxyeicosatrienoic acids
(EETs), which may act as vasoactive agents to control vascular tone. We hypothesized that the regulation of sEH activity may
have a therapeutic value in preventing acute kidney injury by controlling the concentration of EETs. In this study, we
therefore induced ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) in C57BL/6 mice and controlled sEH activity by intraperitoneal
administration of the sEH inhibitor 12-(3-adamantan-1-ylureido)-dodecanoic acid (AUDA). The deterioration of kidney
function induced by IRI was partially moderated and prevented by AUDA treatment. In addition, AUDA treatment
significantly attenuated tubular necrosis induced by IRI. Ischemic injury induced the down-regulation of sEH, and AUDA
administration had no effect on the expression pattern of sEH induced by IRI. In vivo sEH activity was assessed by measuring
the substrate epoxyoctadecenoic acid (EpOME) and its metabolite dihydroxyoctadec-12-enoic acid (DHOME). Ischemic
injury had no effects on the plasma concentrations of EpOME and DHOME, but inhibition of sEH by AUDA significantly
increased plasma EpOME and the EpOME/DHOME ratio. The protective effect of the sEH inhibitor was achieved by
suppression of proinflammatory cytokines and up-regulation of regulatory cytokines. AUDA treatment prevented the
intrarenal infiltration of inflammatory cells, but promoted endothelial cell migration and neovascularization. The results of
this study suggest that treatment with sEH inhibitors can reduce acute kidney injury.

Introduction
Ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) is the leading cause of acute
kidney injury (AKI), which is associated with a high mortality
[1,2]. Although the pathogenesis of renal IRI has not been fully
clarified, hypoxic cell injury both during the ischemic phase and
following inflammatory responses in the reperfusion phase are
known to play roles [3,4].
Epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) are metabolites of arachidonic
acid and are considered likely to represent one of the endothelium￾derived hyperpolarizing factors that mediate the vascular effects of
vasoactive hormones [5–7]. Renal EETs are involved in renal
blood flow regulation and long-term arterial blood pressure
control by acting as an endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing
factor on preglomerular vascular smooth muscle cells to dilate the
afferent arterioles [8]. Hence, renal and cardiovascular diseases
are associated with decreased renal and vascular concentrations of
EETs [9]. EETs also possess potent anti-inflammatory [10] and
fibrinolytic [11] effects. Soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) catalyses
the degradation of EETs to their corresponding diols, and thus
plays a central role in the regulation of EET concentrations [12].
We recently demonstrated a genetic effect of sEH encoded by the
EPHX2 gene on the progression of IgA nephropathy [13] and on
renal allograft survival [14], and some studies have shown
a protective effect of sEH inhibitors against IRI in stroke [15,16]
and ischemia-induced myocardial damage [17–19].
In this study, we hypothesized that increasing the concentration
of EETs by inhibiting sEH could represent a promising thera￾peutic target for AKI. We therefore investigated the effects of the
sEH inhibitor 12-(3-adamantan-1-ylureido)-dodecanoic acid
(AUDA) on the regulation of intrarenal inflammation and
promotion of neovascularization in a mouse renal IRI model.
Materials and Methods
Experimental animals and chemicals
Male C57BL/6 mice weighing 20–22 g and 7–8 weeks old were
purchased from Orient Company (Seoul, Korea). All the mice
were raised in a pathogen-free animal facility. All experiments
were performed under the approval of the Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee of Clinical Research Institute at Seoul
National University Hospital and in accordance with the National
Research Council ‘Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory
Animals’ [20]. The adamantyl alkyl urea-based sEH inhibitor
AUDA was synthesized by one of the co-authors, as previously
PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 May 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 5 | e37075

reported [21]. AUDA was dissolved in (2-hydroxypropyl)-b￾cyclodextrin (cyclodextrin; Sigma Chemical Co., St Louis, MO,
USA) at 5 mg/mL [22].
Induction of renal IRI
An established murine renal IRI model was used [23]. Briefly,
mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of ketamine
(100 mg/kg body weight) and pentobarbital sodium (Nembutal,
50 mg/kg body weight; Abbott, Wiesbaden, Germany). Following
an abdominal midline incision, both renal pedicles were bluntly
dissected and clamped with a microvascular clamp (Roboz
Surgical Instrument, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) for 30 min. During
the procedure, 2 mL of sterile saline at 40uC (1 mL during
ischemia and 1 mL during reperfusion) were instilled into the
peritoneal cavity. After the clamps were removed, the wounds
were sutured and the mice were allowed to recover, with free
access to chow and water. Adequate reperfusion was confirmed
with the naked eye after declamping. The mice were placed on
a heating pad (40uC) throughout the procedure, and blood
pressure was measured using a non-invasive blood pressure system
(Kent Scientific Corp., Chicago, IL, USA). Sham-operated mice
underwent identical surgical procedures, except for clamping of
the renal pedicles. The sEH inhibitor, AUDA (10 mg/kg), or b￾cyclodextrin (300 mL/mouse) was administered intraperitoneally
1 h before ischemia-reperfusion surgery. The dose of AUDA was
selected according to previously published articles [16,22]. Blood
samples were obtained from the tail vein before, and at 24 h and
48 h after renal IRI. Mice were sacrificed 48 h after reperfusion.
Renal function in mice subjected to ischemia surgery was
evaluated by measuring creatinine (Cr) concentrations. Serum
Cr concentrations (mg/dL) were measured using the modified
Jaffe´ rate reaction and an autoanalyzer (Hitachi Chemical
Industries Ltd, Osaka, Japan). Five to six mice were used for each
group and three independent experiments were performed for
each procedure.
Tissue histology
Mice were killed at 48 h after IRI and kidneys were harvested
after exsanguination. Tissue samples were fixed with 10% buffered
formalin, followed by paraffin embedding. Paraffin sections (4 mm)
were then stained with periodic acid-Schiff reagent. The degrees of
tubular injury were scored by a renal histologist blinded to the
sample groups. Cell loss and necrosis were graded according to
five levels, based on the percentages of injured tubules in the
cortex and the two different medullary areas (outer medulla and
inner medulla) respectively (1: ,10%; 2: 10–25%; 3: 25–50%; 4:
50–75%; 5: .75%). Injured tubules were scored according to the
proportions of necrotic tubules and tubular casts relative to the
total number of tubules [23].
Cell culture
Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) (Cambrex,
Walkersville, MD, USA) were cultured for four to six passages in
EGM-2 MV (Clonetics Corp., San Diego, CA, USA) supplemen￾ted with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1 mg/mL hydrocortisone,
12 mg/mL bovine brain extract, 50 mg/mL gentamycin, 50 ng/
mL amphotericin B, and 10 ng/mL epidermal growth factor
(EGF). After 3 days of culture, cells were detached from the dishes
by the addition of a 3 mM EDTA solution and a minimal amount
of trypsin. Cells (26105
/well) were then placed in 8-well chamber
slides with serum-free medium for 24 h and washed twice with
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Cells were incubated with or
without AUDA (10 mM) under hypoxic (1% O2) or normoxic
conditions (20% O2) for 24 h. The expression levels of sEH, p53,
hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1a, vascular endothelial growth
factor (VEGF) receptor-2 (KDR), and c-kit were measured by
confocal microscopy, as described below.
Confocal microscopy
Confocal microscopy was performed using an LSM 510 Meta
laser confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany). For the
immunofluorescence study, paraffin-embedded samples were
collected and cut into 4-mm slices. The slices were deparaffinized
and hydrated using xylene and ethanols, then stained with primary
antibodies in a blocking reagent overnight at 4uC. The antibodies
used were as follows: rabbit sEH (Santa Cruz Biotechnology,
Santa Cruz, CA, USA), rat CD31 (BD Biosciences, Franklin
Lakes, NJ, USA), rat F4/80 (abcam, Cambridge, UK), mouse
CD3 (BD Biosciences), and rabbit myeloperoxidase (MPO)
(abcam). A second layer of Alexa FluorH 488-conjugated goat
anti-rabbit antibody (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, USA), Alexa
FluorH 555-conjugated anti-rat antibody, and Alexa FluorH 555-
conjugated anti-mouse antibody, respectively, were used as
secondary antibodies. All sections were washed and incubated
for an additional 5 min with 49,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole
(DAPI) for counterstaining. Primary antibodies were omitted from
the sections for the negative control.
In another set of experiments, the kidneys were snap-frozen in
OCT embedding medium (Miles Inc., Elkhart, IN, USA), cooled
to 280uC and cut into 5-mm-thick sections using a cryostat (Leica,
Heidelberger, Germany). Frozen sections were fixed for 10 min in
cold acetone. Intrarenal expression of c-kit (Abcam, Cambridge,
UK) and CD31 were measured by confocal microscopy.
Immunofluorescence analysis of HUVECs in culture was
carried out as follows. Briefly, cultured HUVECs in 8-well￾chamber slides were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde and stained for
sEH, p53 (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA, USA) and
HIF-1a (Novus Biologicals, Inc., Littleton, CO, USA). Immuno￾fluorescence analyses of KDR and c-kit were carried out using
cytospin preparations, prepared by centrifugation of 200 mL of cell
suspension for 3 min at 1000 rpm in a Shandon Cytospin III
cytocentrifuge onto conventional glass slides. The slides were then
fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde for 5 min and washed twice with
PBS. Immunostaining was performed using mouse anti-human
KDR (Sigma Chemical Co.) and rabbit anti-human c-kit antibody
for 2 h at room temperature.
Quantification of epoxyoctadecenoic acid and
dihydroxyoctadec-12-enoic acid
Epoxyoctadecenoic acid (EpOME) and dihydroxyoctadec-12-
enoic acid (DHOME) were quantified to investigate the in vivo
activity of sEH using a validated high-performance liquid
chromatography/mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry method,
as described previously [13,24]. Briefly, a 200-mL plasma sample
was spiked with 50 mL of internal standard (200 ng/mL of
(6)12,13 DHOME d4), and 2 mL of diethyl ether was added to
each sample for liquid-liquid extraction. Detection was achieved
using an API-4000 QTRAP (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA,
USA). Eleven working standards were used at concentrations of
500, 250, 150, 100, 50, 25, 10, 5, 1, 0.5, and 0.1 ng/mL.
Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction
Total RNA was extracted from renal tissues harvested from
mice 48 h after the induction of IRI. Cytokine mRNA concentra￾tions were assayed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
Briefly, total RNA was isolated from kidneys using the RNeasyH
kit (Qiagen GmBH, Hilden, Germany) and 1 mg of total RNA was

reverse-transcribed using oligo-d(T) primers and AMV-RT Taq
polymerase (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). Real-time PCR was
performed using assay-on-demand TaqManH probes and primers
for tumor necrosis factor (TNF)- a, monocyte chemoattractant
protein (MCP)-1, interleukin (IL)-10, transforming growth factor
(TGF)-b1, HIF-1 a, VEGF, erythropoietin (EPO), KDR, c-kit and
glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) (Applied
Biosystems) and an ABI PRISMH 7500 Sequence Detection
System (Applied Biosystems). The levels of mRNA expression for
each cytokine were normalized with respect to the level of
GAPDH mRNA expression.
Western blot analysis and cytokine assays
The effects of regulating sEH on proteins levels were analyzed
by western immunoblotting and cytokine assays. Primary anti￾bodies against sEH, c-kit, and b-actin (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis,
MO, USA) were used for western immunoblotting. Briefly, equal
amounts (80 mg) of extracted proteins were separated by 10%
sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and
transferred onto Immobilon-FL 0.4 mM polyvinylidene difluoride
membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Anti-rabbit IgG (Vector
Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) was used as the secondary
antibody. Blots were developed using Super Signal West Pico
Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce, Woburn, MA, USA).
A multiplex cytokine bead array system (Bio-Plex; Bio-Rad) was
used to assay for cytokines, according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
Flow cytometry analysis
For quantitative flow cytometry analysis, intrarenal mono￾nuclear cells were isolated from mouse kidney homogenates using
StomacherH 80 Biomaster (Seward Ltd., Worthing, Sussex, UK).
Single-cell suspensions were created by passing tissue through a 40-
mm cell strainer. Kidneys were resuspended in 36% Percoll
(Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ, USA) and
overlaid onto 72% Percoll. After centrifuging for 30 min at
1000 g at 25uC, renal mononuclear cells were isolated from the
interface. Isolated renal mononuclear cells were incubated with
directly-conjugated mouse monoclonal antibodies to CD3, CD44,
CD45, F4/80, and Gr1 (BD Biosciences). Quantitative fluores￾cence analysis was performed using a FACSCalibur instrument
and CellQuest software (BD Biosciences).

Statistical analysis
All data are expressed as means6S.E. Group means were
compared using Mann-Whitney U-tests, one-way ANOVA
followed by Tukey’s post-hoc analysis, and two-way ANOVA

version 4. Statistical significance was determined when the P value
was ,0.05.
Results
Regulation of sEH activity reduced IRI in kidneys
Renal IRI was induced by bilateral clamping of the renal
pedicles. Renal function deteriorated substantially after IRI (sham
control vs. disease control: day 1 Cr, 0.4960.06 mg/dL vs.
2.9360.19 mg/dL, P,0.001; day 2 Cr, 0.5160.02 mg/dL vs.
2.6560.34 mg/dL, P,0.001). To determine the specific role of
sEH activity in renal IRI, the specific sEH inhibitor AUDA was
administered intraperitoneally (10 mg/kg) 1 h before IRI in￾duction. The severity of renal dysfunction was significantly
attenuated in AUDA-treated mice, compared to disease-control
mice (day 1 Cr, 2.2260.31 mg/dL; day 2 Cr, 1.4060.51 mg/dL,
P,0.05 compared to C57BL/6 disease-control mice, respectively)
(Figure 1A). Blood pressure was monitored during the procedure
using a non-invasive blood pressure system. Administration of the
sEH inhibitor AUDA had no significant effect on blood pressure
compared to administration of vehicle (Figure 1B).
Histological examination revealed that the functional changes
were paralleled by structural changes. IRI induced tubular
necrosis, consisting of the disruption and sloughing of tubular
epithelial cells. Tubular necrosis was more prominent in proximal
tubules and tubular casts were more obvious in distal tubules
(Figure S1). Tubular injury was significantly increased in disease￾control mice, but AUDA pretreatment significantly protected
against ischemic injury (Figure 2A, 2B). We further confirmed the
expression patterns of sEH by immunofluorescence. Confocal
microscopy demonstrated prominent expression of sEH in the
endothelium of the intraglomerular capillary loops and peritubular
capillaries under normal conditions (Figure 2C). Ischemic injury
induced down-regulation of sEH, but AUDA administration
before IRI had no significant effect on the expression of sEH
(Figure 2D, 2E).
Plasma EpOME and EpOME/DHOME ratio were elevated
by sEH inhibition in IRI
Plasma concentrations of the linoleic acid metabolites EpOME
and DHOME were measured to investigate the in vivo activity of
sEH (n = 6 per group) (Figure 3A). EpOME is a substrate and
DHOME is a metabolite of sEH. Ischemic injury had no effect on
the plasma concentrations of EpOME and DHOME. However,
9,10-, 12,13- and total EpOME concentrations were significantly
increased in response to sEH inhibition by AUDA after IRI (9,10-
EpOME [ng/mL]: IRI with vehicle 7.362.0 vs. IRI with AUDA
25.466.7, P = 0.011; 12,13-EpOME [ng/mL]: IRI with vehicle
8.161.3 vs. IRI with AUDA 27.266.8, P = 0.018; total EpOME
[ng/mL]: IRI with vehicle 15.563.3 vs. IRI with AUDA
52.6613.5, P = 0.013) (Figure 3B). The EpOME/DHOME ratios
were also changed by sEH inhibition (9,10-EpOME/DHOME:
IRI with vehicle 1.260.5 vs. IRI with AUDA 3.961.3, P = 0.060;
12,13-EpOME/DHOME: IRI with vehicle 0.560.1 vs. IRI with
AUDA 1.760.5, P = 0.034; total EpOME/DHOME: IRI with
vehicle 0.760.2 vs. IRI with AUDA 2.360.8, P = 0.043)
(Figure 3C). However, there were no significant changes in
DHOME plasma concentrations.
Switch from pro- to anti-inflammatory microenvironment
in injured kidneys by sEH inhibition
To evaluate the molecular and cellular mechanisms responsible
for the renoprotective effect of the sEH inhibitor, we quantified the
cytokines that may influence the extent of renal damage caused by
IRI using real-time PCR and a multiplex cytokine bead array
system. Real-time PCR analysis revealed up-regulation of proin￾flammatory cytokines such as TNF-a and MCP-1 associated with
the development of IRI in C57BL/6 mice. However, these up￾regulated proinflammatory cytokines were significantly suppressed
by AUDA treatment. Although IRI also induced up-regulation of
the regulatory cytokine IL-10, this change was augmented by
AUDA treatment. In addition, AUDA injection significantly
enhanced the expression of TGF-b after IRI injury (Figure 4A).
Similarly, multiplex cytokine assays revealed that AUDA treat￾ment significantly suppressed the proinflammatory cytokine IL-6,
and up-regulated regulatory cytokines such as IL-4 and IL-10
(Figure 4B). Immunofluorescence analysis was performed to
identify inflammatory cell infiltrations. Macrophages (F4/80),
lymphocytes (CD3), and neutrophils (MPO) mainly trafficked in
the interstitial area (Figure 4C), but neutrophil infiltration was
relatively low, compared to infiltrations of macrophages or
lymphocytes. AUDA reduced the infiltration of inflammatory cells.
Flow cytometric analysis was performed to analyze inflamma￾tory cell trafficking in IRI quantitatively. Macrophages/monocytes
expressing F4/80, T cells expressing CD3, and neutrophils
expressing Gr1 were all significantly increased in IRI mice
compared to sham controls, and these cellular infiltrations were
attenuated by AUDA pretreatment (Figure 4D).
sEH inhibition prevented hypoxic damage via HIF-1a and
neovascularization
We assessed the expression patterns of molecules associated with
endothelial cell migration and neovascularization. HIF-1a was up￾regulated by IRI, though the difference was not significant, and it
was further enhanced by AUDA administration (Figure 5A).
VEGF and EPO, the target genes of HIF-1a, showed similar
expression patterns to HIF-1a (Figure 5A). KDR expression was
significantly decreased compared to levels in control mice after
IRI. AUDA treatment restored the expression levels of these
molecules to the levels seen in age-matched injury controls
(Figure 5A). When HUVECs were exposed to hypoxia, apoptosis
progressed with little change in HIF-1a expression. However,
AUDA pretreatment prevented hypoxic HUVECs from un￾dergoing apoptosis, associated with an increase in HIF-1a
expression (Figure 5B).
c-kit (CD117) is a cytokine receptor that is expressed on the
surface of hematopoietic stem cells. Confocal microscopy revealed
that c-kit was also expressed prominently in the endothelium of
intraglomerular and peritubular capillaries (Figure 5C, 5D). Levels
decreased after IRI, but were significantly amplified by AUDA
administration (Figure 5C, 5D, 5E). Enhanced c-kit and KDR
expression levels in AUDA-treated hypoxic HUVECs were
paralleled by the in vivo IRI model (Figure 5F).
Discussion
This study evaluated the effects of the adamantyl alkyl urea￾based sEH inhibitor AUDA on renal damage caused by IRI.
AUDA modulated cytokine secretion and inflammatory cell
infiltration at the site of injury, and may have had an effect on
renal recovery through activation of HIF-1a and subsequent
neovascularization. A few studies have demonstrated a protective
effect of sEH inhibitors against IRI such as in stroke [15,16] or
Epoxide Hydrolase and Acute Kidney Injury

ischemia-induced myocardial damage [17–19]. However, this is
the first study to demonstrate that sEH inhibition can also
effectively protect against IRI-induced renal damage.
IRI is the result of a cascade of reactions, including non￾immune injury and immune responses. IRI stimulates the synthesis
of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-1, IL-6, and TNF￾a [25,26]. Chemokines also play a role in the pathogenesis of renal
injury in post-ischemic kidneys [27]. In contrast, anti-inflamma￾tory cytokines such as IL-10 have been suggested to act as
protective or beneficial cytokines, reducing renal injury after IRI
[28]. EETs, which are regulated by sEH in endothelial cells, are
known to prevent endothelial dysfunction via vasodilatory and
non-vasodilatory effects, and anti-inflammatory effects represent
an important non-vasodilatory property, distinct from their
membrane-hyperpolarizing effect. EETs exert anti-inflammatory
effects through the inhibition of nuclear factor-kB-mediated
endothelial cell adhesion molecule expression and the prevention
of leukocyte adhesion to the vascular wall [10]. In addition, sEH
inhibitors indirectly reduced the production of NO, cytokines, and
proinflammatory lipid mediators, minimized systemic hypoten￾sion, and prevented mortality in a mouse model of septic shock.
They also accelerated inflammatory resolution by enhancing
lipoxin A4 production [29]. The present study demonstrated that
AUDA treatment significantly suppressed the up-regulation of
TNF-a and MCP-1 induced by IRI and augmented IL-10
secretion. These findings are consistent with those of previous
studies.
Despite the restoration of blood flow during recovery from IRI,
an irreversible rarefaction of renal blood vessels persists following
the initial resolution of AKI [30]. Furthermore, reductions in
vascular density occur following acute IRI, and although the
mechanisms mediating vascular loss are unclear, they may relate
to the lack of effective vascular repair responses. Previous studies
have shown that increased cytochrome P450-derived EETs have
proliferative and angiogenic effects. The release of heparin￾binding EGF-like growth factor from the endothelial cell surface

was expressed in the endothelium of intraglomerular capillary loops and peritubular capillaries. D and E: Ischemic injury induced the down-regulation

and the subsequent activation of EGF-receptor-dependent signal￾ing have been suggested to underlie this angiogenesis [31,32].
HIF-1, which consists of an oxygen-sensitive a-subunit and
a constitutively-expressed b-subunit, is one of the key factors in
the cellular adaptation to hypoxia [33]. HIF-target genes such as
EPO, VEGF, and GLUT-1 are also up-regulated as an adaptive
response to hypoxia [34,35]. VEGF has been suggested to act as
a protective or beneficial cytokine, reducing renal injury after IRI
[36]. A previous study revealed that increasing EETs reduced cell
death via HIF-1a activation [37]. In addition, EETs induce
angiogenesis through activation of STAT-3 and VEGF expression
[38]. Although HIF-1a expression was only slightly enhanced by
IRI or hypoxia in our study, sEH inhibition by AUDA
significantly increased HIF-1a expression, with similar patterns
of expression seen for HIF-1a target genes. The present study
provided the first evidence for a significant increase in the
hematopoietic stem cell marker c-kit as a result of sEH inhibition
by AUDA.
Several animal studies have suggested that sEH inhibitors may
be promising therapeutic agents for cardiovascular disease [15–

{P,0.05 compared to IRI+vehicle). C: AUDA decreased the infiltration of inflammatory cells (macrophages (F4/80), lymphocytes (CD3), and
neutrophils (MPO)) mainly trafficked in the interstitial area. D: AUDA attenuated the infiltration of macrophages/monocytes and T cells expressing
CD3, as shown by flow cytometry. F4/80, marker for pan-macrophage; CD44, indicative marker for effector-memory T-cells; CD45, leukocyte common

19,39,40]. In addition, studies of polymorphisms in the gene
encoding sEH (EPHX2) have shown that amino-acid substitutions
can influence sEH activity in patients with cardiovascular diseases
[41–44]. As a result, clinical trials have been initiated, including
a phase IIa clinical trial of the novel sEH enzyme inhibitor
AR9281 (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00847899). In the
field of nephrology, sEH inhibitors have also been tested as
therapeutic targets in several animal kidney disease models [45–
Figure 5. Protective effects of soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) inhibitor on hypoxic damage via neovascularization. A: Hypoxia
inducible factor (HIF)-1a, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), VEGF receptor-2 (KDR), and erythropoietin (EPO) were enhanced by 12-(3-
adamantan-1-ylureido)-dodecanoic acid (AUDA) administration. (*P,0.05 compared to sham; #P,0.05 compared to sham; {P,0.05 compared to
ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) +vehicle). B: Hypoxia induced the down-regulation of sEH in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Cells
were incubated with or without AUDA (10 mM) under hypoxic (1% O2) or normoxic conditions (20% O2) for 24 h. Apoptosis of HUVECs was assessed
by p53 expression. Hypoxia induced apoptosis in HUVECs, but AUDA treatment reduced apoptosis associated with enhancement of HIF-1a. DAPI was
used for counterstaining (magnification, 6400). C and D: c-kit (CD117) expression decreased after IRI, but was amplified by AUDA administration
(magnification, 6800). E: AUDA treatment significantly enhanced c-kit expression. Data represent the results of one of three independent
experiments (n = 6 per group; {P,0.05 compared to IRI+vehicle). F: AUDA treatment increased c-kit and KDR expression levels in HUVECs exposed to
hypoxia.

47]. We recently confirmed an effect of EPHX2 genetic
polymorphisms on kidney transplantation [14] and IgA nephrop￾athy [13], the most common chronic glomerulonephritis.
Although the results of this study are informative, the study had
some limitations. First, there are currently no reports of any
adverse or toxic side effects of sEH inhibitors, and no complica￾tions or side effects were detected in the current study. In addition,
when the study was repeated using half the dose of AUDA (5 mg/
kg), a dose-dependent response was obtained (data not shown).
However, data on side effects or LD50 values are needed before
sEH inhibitors can be used as therapeutic drugs for human
diseases. Second, EETs have multiple bioactivities, including
direct vasodilation, anti-inflammatory and profibrinolytic effects,
and inhibition of vascular smooth muscle proliferation and
migration. We examined the vasodilatory effect of AUDA during
surgery by measuring blood pressure; however, no difference in
blood pressure was detected between the two groups. We only
confirmed an anti-inflammatory effect and recovery of endothelial
function, but were unable to differentiate between a direct effect
and other biologic effects of AUDA.
In conclusion, the results of the current study suggest that sEH
inhibitors may have therapeutic potential for the treatment of
kidney diseases. However, further studies are needed to clarify the
dose-response and adverse-effect profiles of these agents.

Figure S1 Characterization of Injured Tubule. The brush
border of the proximal tubules has an affinity for periodic acid￾Schiff (PAS) reagents. Proximal tubules are characterized by
abundant cytoplasm and an easily-identifiable brush border, and
the amount of cytoplasm, the height of the cells, and the brush
border are more prominent in the proximal convoluted portion.
The distal tubules and collecting duct cells have less-abundant
cytoplasm than the proximal tubular cells, and it is therefore
relatively easy to distinguish between proximal and distal tubules
by PAS staining. In addition, the collecting duct contains two cell
types: principal cells containing aquaporin 2 (AQP 2), with an
important function in water reabsorption; and intercalated cells,
with high carbonic anhydrase activity 2 (CAII) and an important
role in acid-base balance. Immunohistochemical staining of AQP2
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA) and CAII
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology) confirmed the cells with less-abundant
cytoplasm and no brush border as distal tubular cells. Tubular
necrosis was more prominent in the proximal tubules, while
tubular casts were obvious in the distal tubules in the outer
medulla (OM) where the tubular injury was most evident.
