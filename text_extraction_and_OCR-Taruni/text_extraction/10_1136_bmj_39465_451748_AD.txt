ABSTRACT
Objective To examine whether the association of
inadequate or unclear allocation concealment and lack of
blinding with biased estimates of intervention effects
varies with the nature of the intervention or outcome.
Design Combined analysis of data from three meta￾epidemiological studies based on collections of meta￾analyses.
Data sources 146 meta-analyses including 1346 trials
examining a wide range of interventions and outcomes.
Main outcome measures Ratios of odds ratios quantifying
the degree of bias associated with inadequate or unclear
allocation concealment, and lack of blinding, for trials
with different types of intervention and outcome. A ratio of
odds ratios <1 implies that inadequately concealed or non￾blinded trials exaggerate intervention effect estimates.
Results In trials with subjective outcomes effect estimates
were exaggerated when there was inadequate or unclear
allocation concealment (ratio of odds ratios 0.69 (95% CI
0.59 to 0.82)) or lack of blinding (0.75 (0.61 to 0.93)). In
contrast, there was little evidence of bias in trials with
objective outcomes: ratios of odds ratios 0.91 (0.80 to
1.03) for inadequate or unclear allocation concealment
and 1.01 (0.92 to 1.10) for lack of blinding. There was little
evidence for a difference between trials of drug and non￾druginterventions. Exceptfor trialswith all causemortality
as the outcome, the magnitude of bias varied between
meta-analyses.
Conclusions The average bias associated with defects in
the conduct of randomised trials varies with the type of
outcome. Systematic reviewers should routinely assess
the risk of bias in the results of trials, and should report
meta-analyses restricted to trials at low risk of bias either
as the primary analysis or in conjunction with less
restrictive analyses.
INTRODUCTION
Randomised controlled trials, and systematic reviews
of these trials, are the best way to evaluate the effects of
healthcare interventions.1 However, defects in the
methodological quality of randomised controlled trials
may bias their results, and hence the results of meta￾analyses that include them.2 Empirical evidence on
specific trial characteristics associated with bias in
estimates of intervention effect has come from collec￾tions of meta-analyses assembled in so called meta￾epidemiological studies.3
Several studies havefoundthattrials with inadequate
allocation concealment or lack of blinding (see box 1)
tend to exaggerate estimates of intervention effects,
compared with adequately concealed or adequately
blinded trials.4-7 However, other studies have failed to
confirm these associations.8 9 A possible reason for
theseinconsistencies isthatthemagnitude of bias varies
between meta-analyses according to other trial char￾acteristics such as the nature of the intervention or
outcome. For example, biases associated with lack of
blinding might be greater in trials with subjectively
assessed outcomes, while bias associated with inade￾quate allocation concealment may be greater when
patients’ prognosis can readily be assessed at the time
of recruitment to trials, leading to the possibility of
selection bias.
We combined data on a large number of controlled
trials from three meta-epidemiological studies to
examine whether the effects of reported allocation
concealment and blinding on estimates of intervention
effects differ depending on the nature of the outcome
(objective or subjective, all cause mortality or other
outcome) and according to whether the meta-analysis
examined a drug or non-drug intervention.
METHODS
After a meeting held in November 2001 to which
authors of all published meta-epidemiological studies
were invited, five datasets were made available for us to
use in a combined study.We excluded data from two of
the studies: the data ofMoher et al were not available in

a suitable format,5whereasMcAuley et al did not assess
the methodological quality of their included trials.10
We analysed the data from the three remaining studies,
which included information on allocation conceal￾ment, blinding, and outcome events.467
Schulz et al used 33 meta-analyses from the
Pregnancy and Childbirth Group of the Cochrane
Collaboration.4 Each meta-analysis included at least
five trials with a combined total of at least 25 outcome
events. Kjaergard et al used 14 meta-analyses from 11
systematic reviews, all of which included at least one
trial of at least 1000 participants.6 Egger et al analysed
122 meta-analyses from the Cochrane Database of
Systematic Reviews that contained at least five rando￾mised trials.7 Table 1 summarises the methods of each
of these studies, including the way that meta-analyses
were selected from within systematic reviews and the
trial characteristics examined.
We searchedMedline, followed by Embase, in order
to assign unique identifiers provided by the literature
databases to each meta-analysis and each trial.
References not indexed in either database were
manually assigned a unique identifier. Using the
identifier variable, we identified meta-analyses con￾taining at least one overlapping trial.We then removed
duplicate meta-analyses until there was no overlap
between the remaining meta-analyses except for a
small number of trials that contributed to more than
one meta-analysis because they had more than one
intervention arm or presented more than one outcome.
Assessment of trial quality
In the study by Schulz et al one researcher, who was
blinded to the trial outcome, assessed the methodolo￾gical quality of the included trials using a detailed
classification scheme.4 In the study by Kjaergard et al
assessments were done by two observers who were not
blinded to study results.6 Inter-rater reliability of
quality assessments was assessed in 30 randomly
selected randomised controlled trials and found to be
high (intraclass correlation coefficient 0.96). The study
of Egger et al was based on quality assessments by
authors of the Cochrane reviews, which were generally
done in duplicate by two observers.7
Table 2 shows the definitions used in the three
studies for concealment of allocation and blinding.
Definitions of adequate allocation concealment and
blinding were similar in all three studies. Allocation
concealment was assessed as adequate, unclear, or
inadequate in two studies 4 7 and as adequate or
inadequate in the other. 6 Blinding was assessed as
present (trials described as double blind and using
adequate methods such as identical placebo tablets or
including blinding of the person assessing outcome) or
absent (blinding not performed or not reported, or
distinguishable interventions such as tablets and
injections were compared). We assessed inter-study
reliability of quality assessment using trials included in
more than one study and found it was good (median κ
statistic 0.67).
Interventions and outcomes
For each meta-analysis in the final dataset, we classified
the type of intervention and the type of outcome.
Classifications were finalised before we examined
associations with trial characteristics. We coded inter￾ventions using the classification of Moja et al11 (drugs;
rehabilitation or psychosocial; prevention or screen￾ing; surgery or radiotherapy; communication, organi￾sational, or educational; alternative therapeutic; other)
and subsequently dichotomised them as drug or non￾drug interventions.
We classified outcomes in two ways: firstly, as
objectively or subjectively assessed, and, secondly, as
all cause mortality or other outcomes. The definition of
objective and subjective outcomes was based on the
extent to which outcome assessment could be influ￾enced by investigators’judgment.Objectively assessed
outcomes included all cause mortality, measures based
on a recognised laboratory procedure (such as
measurement of haemoglobin concentrations), other
objectivemeasures(such as preterm birth), and surgical
or instrumental outcomes (all of these were concerned
with childbirth, such as caesarean section or instru￾mental delivery). Note that such surgical outcomes
(classified as objectively assessed) depend on doctors’
decisions, which could, in the absence of blinding, be
affected by knowledge of the intervention received.
Subjectively assessed outcome measures included
patient reported outcomes, physician assessed disease
outcomes (such as vascular events, pyelonephritis, or
respiratory distress syndrome), measures combined
Box 1: Definitions of trial characteristics studied in this paper
Allocation concealment: procedures that secure strict implementation of the schedule
of random assignments by preventing foreknowledge of forthcoming allocations by
study participants or by those recruiting them to the trial
 It is always feasible to conceal allocation
 Failure to conceal allocation may lead to biased selection of participants into intervention
groups
 Examples of procedures usually considered adequate include sequentially numbered
drug containers of identical appearance; central allocation (including web based or
pharmacy controlled randomisation); and sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed
envelopes
 Examples of procedures usually considered inadequate include using an open random
allocation schedule; assignment envelopeswithout appropriate safeguards (for example,
unsealed or non-opaque or not sequentially numbered); and alternation or rotation
Blinding: procedures that prevent study participants, caregivers, or outcome assessors
from knowing which intervention was received
 Blinding of participants and caregivers may not be feasible—for example, in a trial of
surgery versus radiotherapy for prostate cancer. In such circumstances it may still be
possible to blind assessment of outcomes
 Blinding may reduce the risk that knowledge of the intervention received, rather than the
intervention itself, affects outcomes or outcome measurements
 Examples of procedures usually considered adequate include provision of
indistinguishable placebo tablets and use of a sham surgical procedure in the control
group
 An example of blinded outcome assessment is assessment of medical records to
ascertain cause of death by an“outcome adjudication committee”unaware ofintervention
status

from several outcomes, and withdrawals or study
dropouts. When different methods of outcome assess￾ment were used in different trials in the same meta￾analysis we classified the review according to the most
subjective method. For example, reviews of smoking
cessation used “the most rigorous assessment reported
by each included trial.” For some trials this was an
objective measurement of exhaled carbon monoxide,
for some it was repeated questionnaires, and for some it
was a single interview. We therefore classified the
outcome in this meta-analysis as “patient reported,”
based on the trials using interviews to assess smoking
behaviour.
Statistical methods
We measured intervention effects as odds ratios.
Outcome events were recoded where necessary so
that an odds ratio below 1 indicated a beneficial effect of
the experimental intervention. We calculated the
combined effect estimates separately in trials with
and without the characteristic of interest (inadequate or
unclear allocation concealment or lack of blinding).
We used logistic regression models described
previously12 to estimate ratios of odds ratios comparing
intervention effects in trials with and without the
characteristic of interest. For example, a ratio of odds
ratios of 0.7 for trials without blinding would imply that
the estimates of intervention effects were exaggerated
by 30% in trials without blinding compared with trials
with blinding. We derived 95% confidence intervals
using robust standard errors allowingfor heterogeneity
between meta-analyses.12
We also calculated ratios of odds ratios separately in
each meta-analysis and combined these using random
effects meta-analyses, in order to estimate variability
between meta-analyses in the effect of trial
characteristics.12 Ratios of odds ratios estimated in
this way were consistent with those estimated by
logistic regression and are not reported here. Note that
meta-analyses in which all trials had the same value of a
characteristic (for example, allocation was inade￾quately concealed in all trials) did not contribute to
the estimated effect of that characteristic.
We included interaction terms in logistic regression
models to assess whether effects of trial quality varied
with the type of intervention or type of outcome. To
assess whether there was confounding between the
effects of allocation concealment and blinding, we
estimated the effect of each characteristic on inter￾vention effects in the same logistic regression model.

All analyses were done in Stata SE version 9.0 (Stata
Corporation, College Station, Texas).
RESULTS
Of 159 meta-analyses contained in the three studies
that contributed data, we analysed a total of 146, which
included 1346 trials (table 1). Table 3 shows the
characteristics of these meta-analyses and trials. The
commonest interventions were drug treatments (89
(61%) meta-analyses and 919 (68%) trials) and preven￾tion or screening interventions (22 (15%) meta￾analyses, 161 (12%) trials). The commonest types of
outcome were physician assessed outcomes (42 (29%)
meta-analyses, 323 (24%) trials) and all cause mortality
(27 (18%) meta-analyses, 295 (22%) trials). Outcomes
were classified as objectively assessed in 78 (53%) meta￾analyses and 718 (53%) trials.
Allocation concealment and estimates of intervention
effects
We included 102 meta-analyses in our analysis of
associations between allocation concealment and
estimates of intervention effects (fig 1). Of the 804
trials in these meta-analyses, 272 (34%) had adequate
allocation concealment. Overall, intervention effect
estimates were exaggerated by 17% in the trials with
inadequate or unclear allocation concealment com￾pared with those with adequate allocation concealment
(ratio of odds ratios 0.83(95% CI 0.74to 0.93)). The size
of the bias varied between meta-analyses (heterogene￾ity variance 0.11, P<0.001).
Bias associated with inadequate or unclear allocation
concealment seemed restricted to trials assessing out￾comes other than all cause mortality (ratio of odds
ratios 0.76 (95% CI 0.66 to 0.87)): there was no
evidence of such bias in trials assessing all cause
mortality (ratio of odds ratios 1.01 (0.90 to 1.14),
interaction P=0.002). The effect of allocation conceal￾ment also varied (interaction P=0.009) according to
whether trials had subjectively assessed outcomes
(ratio of odds ratios 0.69 (0.59 to 0.82)) or objectively
assessed outcomes (0.91 (0.80 to 1.03)). The variability
between meta-analyses in bias (see fig 1) was lower
when the outcome was all cause mortality than for
other types of outcome. There was little evidence
(interaction P=0.27) that bias associated with inade￾quate allocation concealment differed in trials that
assessed drug interventions compared with trials
assessing non-drug interventions.
Blinding and estimates of intervention effects
Figure 2 shows the associations between blinding and
estimates of intervention effects, based on 76 meta￾analyses containing 746 trials, of which 432 (58%) were
blinded. Overall, estimates of intervention effects were
exaggerated by 7% in non-blinded compared with
blinded trials (ratio of odds ratios 0.93 (0.83 to 1.04)),
although the size of the bias varied between meta￾analyses (heterogeneity variance 0.11, P<0.001).
The bias associated with lack of blinding was greater
(interaction P=0.011) in trials assessing outcomes other
than all cause mortality (ratio of odds ratios 0.83 (0.70
to 0.98))than in those assessing all cause mortality (1.04
(0.95 to 1.14)). Similarly, bias associated with lack of
blinding seemed restricted to trials with subjectively
assessed outcomes (ratio of odds ratios 0.75 (0.61 to
0.93)), with no evidence of such bias in trials with
objective outcomes (1.01 (0.92 to 1.10)) (interaction
P=0.010). There was little evidence (interaction
P=0.66) that the size of the bias associated with lack of
blinding differed between trials of drug and non-drug
interventions. The variability between meta-analyses
in bias (see fig 2) was lower when the outcome was all
cause mortality than for other types of outcome.
It can be argued that, unless allocation is adequately
concealed, it is impossible for a trial to be adequately
blinded. We therefore restricted analyses of the
association of lack of blinding with intervention effect
estimates to the trials assessed as having adequate
allocation concealment. In this analysis (12 meta￾analyses including 60trials)there was no evidence of an
association between blinding and intervention effect
estimates (ratio of odds ratios 1.02 (0.92 to 1.14)).
Results were similar when further restricted to the
seven meta-analyses (42 trials) that assessed objective
outcomes(1.03(0.92to 1.16)). Inthefive meta-analyses

(18 trials) with subjective outcomes, results were
similar to those in the main analyses presented in
figure 2 (ratio of odds ratios 0.80 (0.49 to 1.31)),
although the confidence interval was wide.
Combined analysis of the effects of allocation
concealment and blinding
To investigate whether allocation concealment and
blinding were independent of each other in their effects
on estimates of intervention effect, we included the
effects of each characteristic in the same logistic
regression model. For all cause mortality and other
objectively assessed outcomes, there was little change
in the estimated effects of allocation concealment and
blinding. For subjectively assessed outcomes, the effect
of each characteristic was modestly attenuated (ratio of
odds ratios for inadequate or unclear allocation
concealment 0.75 (0.63 to 0.88), for lack of blinding
0.77 (0.65 to 0.91)). Similar attenuation was seen for
outcomes other than all cause mortality (ratio of odds
ratiosfor inadequate or unclear allocation concealment
0.80 (0.73 to 0.87), for lack of blinding 0.85 (0.76 to
0.95)).
DISCUSSION
We analysed a dataset that included many meta￾analyses and trials and represented a wide variety of
clinical disciplines, interventions, and outcomes. We
found that bias in intervention effect estimates from
clinical trials, resulting from inadequate allocation
concealment and lack of blinding, varied according to
the type of outcome assessed. There was little evidence
of bias in trials assessing all cause mortality or other
objectively assessed outcomes. In contrast, inadequate
allocation concealment and lack of blinding were
associated with over-optimistic estimates of inter￾vention effects for subjectively assessed outcomes.
The size of bias varied between meta-analyses, but this
variability was less intrials assessing all cause mortality,
where there was little evidence of bias. It thus seems
that in situations when bias is likely the size of such bias
is unpredictable.
Strengths and weaknesses of study
The reported quality of a trial may not reflect the way
that it was conducted in practice: well conducted trials
may be reported badly.13 14 For example, inter￾pretations and definitions of single, double, and triple
blinding have been shown to vary greatly between
physicians and textbooks.15 In our study many trials
will have been classified as blinded solely because they
were described as “double blind” without any further
details on who was blinded and how blinding was
achieved. Even clearer patterns than those identified
here might have emerged had more accurate informa￾tion on the conduct of the trials been available.
We assembled a large dataset by combining data
from three meta-epidemiological studies, but the way
in which trial characteristics were assessed varied
between the original studies. However, cross classifica￾tion of trials that were assessed in at least two studies
indicated good agreement. The study of Egger et al7
relied on assessments of trial quality by the authors of
Cochrane reviews rather than by methodological
experts. Despite the standardised guidelines specified
in the Cochrane handbook,16 evaluations by authors of
Cochrane reviews of whether a study had adequate
allocation concealment may be inconsistent.17 The
effect of trial quality on estimates of intervention effect
in this study was, however, in line with previous studies
in which quality was assessed by the same observers:
one would expect attenuation of effects if assessments
in Cochrane reviews were less reliable.
Other types of bias that may affect the results of
randomised controlled trials include bias due to
selective reporting of outcomes18 19 and bias due to

exclusion of patients from analyses because of lack of
adherence to the randomised intervention or missing
outcome data.20We did not account forthese sources of
bias in our study, and hence our assessment of the
effects of inadequate allocation concealment or lack of
blinding could be confounded by them, as well as by
characteristics of study populations and interventions
that influence estimates of intervention effects.
Results in context with other literature
Some meta-epidemiological studies, including but not
restricted to those combined here, have provided
evidence that inadequate or unclear allocation con￾cealment and lack of double blinding are associated
with over-optimistic estimates of the effect of inter￾ventions assessed in clinical trials.4-7 However, the
evidence is not consistent. Balk et al found no
association between adequacy of allocation conceal￾ment or double blinding and effect estimates.8 Als￾Nielsen et al alsofound no association with adequacy of
allocation concealment, but they did find that trials
with inadequate or unclear generation of the allocation
sequence tended to exaggerate effects.9 21 Their esti￾mated effect of blinding was similar to that reported in
our study.
Interestingly, the largest group of meta-analyses
included in the study of Balk et al8were of interventions
against cardiovascular disease, specifically selected
because the outcome was all cause mortality. This may
explain why they found little evidence of an effect of
either allocation concealment or blinding. For the
other topics examined by Balk et al (infectious disease,
paediatrics, and surgery), confidence intervals for the
effects of allocation concealment and blinding were
wide and consistent with the overall effects reported
here, although analyses stratified by type of outcome
were not presented.
Possible mechanisms
Our finding that bias resulting from inadequate
allocation concealment varied with the type of out￾come variable was unexpected. The purpose of
allocation concealment is to avoid selection bias,
whereby knowledge of prognosis at the time of
recruitment to a randomised trial influences the inter￾vention group to which the patient is allocated.17 22
Such selection bias would be expected to be greatest
when it is easy to assess patients’ prognosis at the time
they are recruited to atrial, and affect the results of trials
with objectively assessed as well as subjectively
assessed outcomes. Conversely, lack of blinding
would be expected to introduce bias if knowledge of
intervention groups affected the care received or the
assessment of outcomes. This could happen indepen￾dently of whether selection bias due to inadequate
concealment of allocation was present.
There was a strong association between inadequate
or unclear allocation concealment and lack of blinding:
about three quarters of trials with adequate conceal￾ment were classified as blinded, compared with half of
trials with inadequate or unclear concealment. In trials
with inadequate or unclear allocation concealment or
lack of double blinding, exaggerated intervention
effects continued to be seen for subjectively assessed
outcomes when the effect of each characteristic was
estimated after controlling for the other. Only 60 trials,
in 12 meta-analyses, contributed to analyses of the
effect of blinding when these were restricted to trials
with adequate concealment of allocation.We were thus
unable to estimate with precision the effect of blinding
independently of the effect of allocation concealment.
The bias we observed with inadequate or unclear
allocation concealment may result at least in part from
its association with subsequent flaws in the conduct of
the trial, in particular with biased outcome assessment,
rather than from selection bias. Adequate allocation
concealment may also be a marker for other strategies
for reducing bias, beyond blinding, as its effect remains
when adjusted for blinding.
Implications
There is a broad consensus that the reporting of
randomised controlled trials should be improved and
standardised, with many medical journals having
adopted the CONSORT (consolidated standards of
reporting trials) recommendations.23 24 Many of the
trials included in this study were published before the
CONSORT statement. Improved transparency about
the way that trials were conducted should allow a
refined understanding of the potential of different
aspects of the conduct of trials to bias results, and how
such bias varies between different settings. Our results
suggest that efforts to minimise selection and perfor￾mance bias are particularly important when objective
measurement of outcomes is not feasible. It is always
WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPIC
Flaws in the conduct of randomised controlled trials, such as
inadequate allocation concealment or lack of blinding, may
bias their results
Several studies have found that such flaws lead to
exaggerated estimates of the effects of medical
interventions, but other studies have failed to confirm these
associations
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS
The average bias associatedwithlack of adequate allocation
concealment or lack of blinding was less for trials with
objectively assessed outcomes than trials with subjectively
assessed outcomes, and less for trials with all cause
mortality as the outcome than for trials with other outcomes
Except when the outcome was all cause mortality, the size of
bias varied between meta-analyses. Therefore, in situations
when bias is likely the size of such bias is unpredictable
Since the bias associated with inadequate or unclear
allocation concealment varied with outcome, it may result in
part from an association with subsequent flaws in the
conduct of the trial rather than from selection biases. The
effect of allocation concealment remained even after
adjustment for blinding, suggesting it is a marker for other
bias-reducing strategies, beyond blinding

possible to conceal the allocation of patients to inter￾vention groups, for example by using a telephone
randomisation service. In contrast, blinding of partici￾pants and physicians is not always feasible; such as
when surgery is compared with radiotherapy for
treatment of cancer, or when a drug has unmistakable
adverse effects. Our results suggest that in such
situations it is desirable to specify at least one
objectively assessed outcome, even if the outcome of
most interest is subjective.
Systematic reviewers should routinely assess the risk
of bias in results associated with the way each trial was
done. Such critical appraisal should allow for our
finding that lack of blinding or of adequate allocation
concealment is particularly important for subjectively
assessed outcomes. Some critical appraisal checklists,
such astheGATE appraisal,25 ask whetherthe outcome
measurements are either blinded or objective.
The Cochrane Collaboration is publishing detailed
guidance on assessing risk of bias, based on both
empirical evidence and expert opinion, available at
www.cochrane.org/resources/handbook/.26 This
identifies six key domains of trial conduct and
analysis—sequence generation; allocation conceal￾ment; blinding of participants, personnel, and outcome
assessors; incomplete outcome data; selective outcome
reporting; and other factors (specific for study design
and topic). This guidance emphasises that assessments
of risk of bias due to lack of blinding or incomplete data
must be outcome specific. Domain specific assessments
need to be combined into an overall assessment of the
risk of bias (low, unclear, or high) for each outcome.
There is currently no simple or widely accepted
method to integrate assessments of risk of bias into
meta-analyses. The variability in bias between meta￾analyses that we identified implies that more emphasis
in meta-analyses should be given to trials at low risk of
bias, and it may be possible to develop statistical
methods to do this.27 Currently, we believe that
systematic reviewers should present meta-analyses
restricted to trials at low risk of bias for each outcome,
either as the primary analysis or in conjunction with
less restrictive analyses.
Conclusions
Box 2 summarises our recommendations for practice.
The effects on bias in intervention effect estimates of
two key aspects of the conduct of randomised
controlled trials—adequacy of reported allocation
concealment and reported blinding—vary with the
type of outcome variable. In trials with subjectively
assessed outcomes lack of adequate allocation conceal￾ment or of blinding tend to produce over-optimistic
estimates of the effect of interventions. Except for trials
with all cause mortality as the outcome, the size of bias
varies between meta-analyses. Systematic reviewers
should routinely assess the risk of bias in the results of
included trials (and such assessments should be
outcome specific), and should report meta-analyses
restricted to trials at low risk of bias either as the
primary analysis or in conjunction with less restrictive
analyses.

 Authors of systematic reviews, and those critically
