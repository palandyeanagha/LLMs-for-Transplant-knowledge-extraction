It has been long suspected that the increased
work required to move the ponderous thoracic
wall and abdomen during breathing was respon￾sible for hypoventilation and retention of carbon
dioxide in the obesity-hypoventilation or "Pick￾wickian" syndrome (1-4). Increased oxygen
cost of ventilation, decreased lung compliance, in￾creased pressure-volume work done on the lung,
and increased intra-abdominal pressure have been
reported in the extremely obese (5-8), and com￾pliances of the thorax and the total respiratory
system have been reported as low as one-fifth of
normal in Naimark and Cherniack's obese sub￾jects (9). Failure to find reports of the viscous
resistance of the chest wall, which one might
anticipate would be increased, and the total me￾chanical work of breathing in the extremely
obese prompted us to make the measurements to
be reported.
Alterations in the static volume-pressure curves
of the thorax and total respiratory system found
in severe obesity and produced by experimental
mass-loading are dealt with elsewhere (10) as
are changes in total respiratory inertance (11).
The present paper deals principally with total
respiratory work, and because the validity and
accuracy of total respiratory work measurements
depend upon the validity and precision of meas￾urements of total respiratory compliance and total
respiratory resistance, two methods of measuring
each of these respiratory system properties have
been employed and their results compared.
Methods
There were 22 subjects, eight of whom were normal
adult males ranging from 29 to 45 years in age and from

136 to 208 lbs. in weight. Of the 14 obese subjects, who
ranged from 253 to 370 lbs. and 29 to 60 years, four
had the obesity-hypoventilation syndrome. Two of the
remaining ten obese subjects, to be referred to as the
"obese normal" group, had mild arterial hypoxemia
without hypercapnia. Table I gives conventional pul￾monary function data on all subjects; Table II presents
their respiratory mechanics.
In the four patients with the obesity-hypoventilation
syndrome, the diagnosis was based upon the following
criteria: 1) repeated demonstration of Pco2 levels in ar￾terial blood above 48 mm Hg; 2) absence of definite clini￾cal or physiologic evidence of other respiratory disorders
commonly associated with carbon dioxide retention; 3)
improvement or disappearance of arterial hypercapnia
with reduction in weight.
Patients 2 and 3 were in right heart failure shortly
before being studied but were edema-free with normal
venous pressures when studied. Neither had evidence of
left heart failure or pulmonary congestion.
Spirometry was done as described by Kory, Callahan,
Boren, and Syner (12). The functional residual ca￾pacity was determined by the nitrogen washout method
(13) using a rapidly responding nitrogen analyzer. The
nitrogen washout curve was recorded on a direct writing
oscillograph. The index of intrapulmonary mixing (13),
the alveolar nitrogen percentage during a forced ex￾piration at the termination of 7 minutes of the nitrogen
washout, was read from the oscillographic record.
The single-breath carbon monoxide diffusing capacity
was done as described by Ogilvie, Forster, Blakemore,
and Morton (14). The oxygen saturation of arterial
blood was measured by a spectrophotometric method
(15). The arterial pH and Pco, were measured at 370 C
using a radiometer pH meter and the Astrup plasma
equilibration method (16). All borderline and abnor￾mal values were checked by determining the total blood
carbon dioxide content (Van Slyke) and using the nomo￾gram of Singer and Hastings (17). Values given by the
two Pco2 methods checked within 2 mm Hg. Pco2 values
in excess of 48 mm Hg are elevated for this laboratory.
Total respiratory system mechanics were determined
by the tank respirator method described by Otis, Fenn,
and Rahn(18). The validity of the method depends
upon the subject's ability to relax his respiratory muscles
and allow the tank respirator to perform his respiratory
work. Figure 1 diagrams the apparatus employed. Tidal

volume and air flow, measured in a "wedge" spirometer,l
and tank respirator pressure were recorded on a multi￾channel oscillograph (Figure 2). Data were recorded
at three respirator cycling rates, 12, 20, and 30 breaths
per minute, and at varying negative pressures up to
minus 70 cm H2O. Respirator cycle amplitudes from
ambient pressure to minus 25 cm H2O were used, and
periodically higher negative pressures were applied with
a vacuum cleaner powered through a variable transformer.
Static volume-pressure curves for the total respiratory
system were constructed by plotting the volume at
"static" points of zero air flow against the simultaneously
recorded tank respirator pressure (Figures 2 and 3).

Mo.
Total respiratory compliance was calculated as the
mean slope (AV/AP) of the static volume-pressure
curve from the resting mid-position to 1.5 L above it.
1.5 L was chosen because in all subjects the mid-portion
of the curve was linear at least to this point. Total
respiratory resistance was calculated at air flows of 0.5
L per second from tank respirator data by applying the
resistance calculation of von Neergaard and Wirz (19),
the tank respirator pressure being treated as is esopha￾geal pressure in the pulmonary resistance calculation.
Breaths of modest amplitude associated with respirator
pressures less than minus 30 cm H20 were used for
resistance measurements and only consistently reproduci￾ble cycles measured. Resistance values were based on
four to eight resistance measurements on each of five

calculated f rom the relationship between capacitive ele￾ments in series: 1/CT = I/CL + 1/CW, where Cr = total
respiratory compliance, Cw= thoracic wall compliance,
and CL = lung compliance.
Uncertainty about complete subject relaxation led to
the use of independent methods for measuring both total
compliance and total resistance. Naimark and Cherniack's
modification (9) of the mid-position shift method of
Heaf and Prime (22) was used for measuring total
compliance. As shown in Figure 4, steady negative pres￾sures were applied to the supine subject enclosed in a
tank respirator, and the resulting shift in respiratory mid￾position was recorded. When several (8 to 20) different
negative pressures were applied to the thorax, the static
volume-pressure curve of the total respiratory system
could be obtained. The validity of this method depends

upon the observation made by Naimark and Cherniack
(9) that no action potentials are detectable over respira￾tory muscles at the resting mid-position even during ap￾plication of external pressure.-
The independent total respiratory resistance method
used was Mead's modification (23) of the oscillatory
method of Dubois, Brody, Lewis, and Burgess (24).
Sine waves of pressure were applied to a subject's body
surface at the natural frequency of the respiratory sys￾tem at which its mechanical reactance was zero. Be￾cause at this frequency the effects of compliance and
inertance exactly neutralized one another, the mechanical
impedance of the respiratory system was wholly resistive,
and the quotient A applied pressure/A air flow equaled the
total respiratory system resistance. This was determined
as the slope of the oscilloscopic "x-y" plot of applied
pressure against air flow. Total resistance values ob￾tained by this method represented minimal resistance,
because the steepest slopes observed consistently were
used for resistance calculations. They were measured
near the subject's resting mid-position at air flows of 0.5
L per second and represent principally the laminar flow or
linear component of airway resistance plus lung and
thoracic tissue resistances. These measurements apply
to quiet breathing, where air flows do not usually exceed
0.7 or 0.8 L per second, and air flow is mostly laminar.
Total resistance values are averages derived from be￾tween three and seven oscilloscopic photographs.
Action potentials of upper anterolateral intercostals
(2nd, 3rd, and 4th), rectus abdominus, and external ob￾lique muscles were sensed through bipolar silver skin elec￾trodes, 0.5 cm in diameter, with a commercial electromyo￾graph machine.3
Results
Compliances and static volume-pressure curves.
Figure 3 shows static volume-pressure curves for
the total respiratory system, the thorax, and the
lungs. Differences in slope and shape of the total
respiratory and thoracic curves between the nor￾mal subject and the patient with the obesity-hypo￾ventilation (O.H.) syndrome are obvious. Flatter
slopes in many of the total respiratory volume￾pressure curves at small volumes reflect the simi￾lar shapes of the thoracic curves, as lung volume￾pressure curves were essentially linear. This
curved configuration was present in six of the
obese normal subjects and in all O.H. patients
and was associated with reduction of the func￾3 Disa Electronics, Copenhagen, Denmark.

respirator method group averages in liters per
centimeters H20 (+ SE) were 0.104 + 0.005,
0.081 ± 0.007, and 0.045 ± 0.003 respectively for
normal subjects, obese normal subjects, and O.H.
syndrome patients. The mid-position shift method
gave average values of 0.109 + 0.009, 0.072 +
0.010, and 0.043 + 0.005 for the three groups.
By both methods significant differences (p
< 0.05) were present among the subject groups.
In three of the four patients with the hypoventila￾tion syndrome, follow-up studies done after weight
loss associated with decrease in Pco2 revealed no
significant changes in total respiratory compli￾ance despite clinical and physiologic improvement.
Total respiratory compliance was related to the
vital capacity (Figure 6) with a correlation co￾efficient of + 0.84 (p < .001). This relationship
was close to that observed by Naimark and Cher￾niack (9) in their supine studies.
Lung compliance (in liters per centimeter H20
± SE) averaged 0.211 + 0.020 in the normal
subjects, 0.157 + 0.020 in the obese normal sub￾jects, and 0.122 + 0.036 in the O.H. patients.
Group differences were not significant at the 0.05
level.
Thoracic compliance averaged 0.214 + 0.014
in the normal subjects, 0.196 ± 0.018 in the
obese normal subjects, and 0.075 + 0.009 in the

FIG. 7. COMPARISON OF THE TANK RESPIRATOR (ORDI￾NATE) AND OSCILLATORY (ABSCISSA) METHODS FOR MEAS￾URING TOTAL RESPIRATORY RESISTANCE. The diagonal line

thing.
patients with the O.H. syndrome. The differ￾ences between the normal subjects and the O.H.
patients and between the obese normal subjects
and O.H. patients were highly significant (p
< 0.001).
Resistances. By the tank respirator method
total inspiratory resistance in the normal subjects
averaged 4.8 ± 0.5 cm H20 per L per second. In
the obese normal subjects it averaged 7.7 ± 0.72
and in the O.H. patients, 11.6 + 1.8 cm H20
per L per second. The normal subjects were
significantly different from the obese normal sub￾jects and the O.H. patients (p < 0.01), but the
obese normal subjects and O.H. patients did not
differ significantly. The three O.H. patients who
improved had an average total resistance of 8.6
± 1.91 when restudied.
The oscillatory total resistance method gave
group mean values of 1.9 ± 0.07 (SE), 3.1
+ 0.35, and 3.4 ± 0.31 cm H20 per L per second,
respectively, for normal, obese normal, and O.H.
patients. Differences between normal and obese
normal subjects and between normal subjects
and O.H. patients were significant (p < 0.01).
Increases in total respiratory resistance as meas￾ured by this method in the obese subjects were
due almost entirely to increases in pulmonary
resistance.
Pulmonary resistance in the normal subjects
averaged 1.3 + 0.1 (SE); in the obese normal
subjects, 3.8 ± 0.3; and in the 0.11. patients,
3.8 + 0.6 cm H20 per L per second. Differences
between the normal subjects and both obese
groups are significant (p < 0.01).
Two values for thoracic resistance are given
for each subject, one obtained by subtracting pul￾monary resistance from total resistance measured
by the tank respirator method and the other ob￾tained by subtracting the same pulmonary re￾sistance value from the total resistance measured
by the oscillatory method. The tank respiratory
method gave mean values of 3.4 + 0.06, 4.6
± 0.07, and 7.8 + 2.1 cm H20 per L per second
for normal, obese normal, and O.H. patient
groups, respectively. The oscillatory method gave
a mean value of 0.51 + 0.014 for the normal sub￾jects. This is reasonably close to thoracic re￾sistance values of 0.69 obtained in four normal
subjects studied by Ferris, Mead, and Opie (25).

RESPIRATORY WORK IN OBESITY
In obese normal and O.H. groups several nega￾tive values for thoracic resistance were encoun￾tered. This may be related to the fact that meas￾urements of pulmonary and total respiratory
resistance were not simultaneous. Comparison
of values given by the two total respiratory re￾sistance methods indicate that the two methods
are not measuring the same thing (Figure 7).
Certain data were obtained in an attempt to
explain the difference between oscillatory and
tank respirator resistances. They will be pre￾sented here and discussed below. Because respi￾rator resistances were measured supine and os￾cillatory resistances sitting, a comparison of the
pulmonary component of total resistance was
made in O.H. Patients 1 and 2, in the sitting
versus the supine positions. Changing from the
sitting to the supine position increased pulmonary
resistance by 1.2 and 1.4 cm H20 per L per sec￾ond, respectively, in Patients 1 and 2. Exploring
the same question, oscillatory total resistances
were measured in both sitting and supine posi￾tions in five normal subjects, and a mean re￾sistance increase of 0.3 cm H20 per L per second
occurred on becoming supine. This could be
wholly explained by changes in pulmonary re￾sistance.
An attempt was made to determine whether
pulmonary resistance during oscillatory measure￾ments at the natural frequency (5 to 8 cps) was
different from the pulmonary resistance meas￾ured at normal breathing rates. In two normal
subjects oscilloscopic plots of air flow against
esophageal pressure were compared during spon￾taneous breathing at ordinary respiratory rates
and during the application of sinusoidal oscilla￾tions to the thorax at its natural frequency. The
Mlead-Whittenberger subtraction circuit (20)
was used to obtain direct oscilloscopic plots of
air flow against the resistive component of eso￾phageal pressure. The slopes of the oscilloscopic
pressure-flow plots during oscillation at the nat￾ural frequency and during slow resting breath￾ing were identical, indicating that the pulmonary
component of the total resistance was correctly
estimated by the oscillatory method.
Respiratory work. Total respiratory work in
kilogram-meters per 1 L breath (respiratory rate,
20) measured from tank respirator data averaged
0.073 in the normal subjects, 0.095 in the obese
normal subjects, and 0.212 in the O.H. patients.
The differences between the normal subjects and
the two obese groups were significant (p < 0.05
and 0.001). In the three O.H. patients restudied
after partial recovery, the total respiratory work
averaged 0.147 per 1 L breath. The mean de￾crease in total work following clinical improve￾ment was not significant (p > 0.05).
In the normal subjects the total work was
almost evenly divided between that done upon
the lungs and that done upon the thorax. The
slight increase in total respiratory work in the
obese normal group consisted mostly of work
done upon the lung, whereas the increased total
work in the O.H. patients involved increases in
work done on the thorax (three times the normal
average) as well as in that done upon the lungs
(twice normal).
Electromyographic observations. The electri￾cal activity of respiratory muscles was investi￾gated for two reasons. The first was to determine
whether or not the respiratory muscles were
active at end-expiration and other "static" points
and to examine the validity of total compliance
measurements. The second was to find out
whether active expiratory muscle contraction dur￾ing inspiration could explain differences between
the two resistance methods. Observations were
made on five of the normal subjects by surface
electrode recording of upper intercostal, rectus
abdominus, and external oblique potentials during
tank respirator measurements. No attempt was
made to record diaphragmatic potentials because
of its technical difficulty in a conscious subject
enclosed in a tank respirator. When respirator
cycles did not exceed 30 cm H20 in amplitude
and when consistent and reproducible volume￾pressure loops were being inscribed, respiratory
muscle potentials were not detected. During mid￾position shift measurements of total compliance,
electrical silence was present at end-expiration
up to pressures of - 50 cm H20.
Discussion
Static properties
Validity of measurements. The most important
consideration in total compliance measurements in
fully conscious voluntarily relaxed subjects is
735

SHARP, HENRY, SWEANY, MEADOWS, AND PIETRAS
whether or not respiratory muscle activity is
present. Inspiratory muscle activity would cause
overestimation of total compliance; expiratory
muscle activity, underestimation. Nims, Conner,
and Comroe (26) found total compliance sig￾nificantly greater in the awake voluntarily re￾laxed state than in the anesthetized, paralyzed
state when the same subjects were studied under
both conditions. They considered reflex inspira￾tory muscle activity as a possible explanation.
Although respiratory muscle electrical activity
was not detected during our measurements, we
cannot exclude inspiratory muscle activity be￾cause of the limitations of surface recording and
because of our failure to record diaphragmatic
potentials. The agreement of results of the two
compliance methods (Figure 5), however, makes
significant muscle activity unlikely, since it would
be improbable that a subject could set his respi￾ratory muscle tone at the same level during the
two rather different measurement procedures.
The reproducibility of the measurements is ap￾parent and their value in comparing normal with
abnormal states established. Whether our meas￾urements represent the true total compliance is
not known with certainty.
Further consideration of static properties of
the respiratory system demands that gravitational
properties be distinguished from true elastic prop￾erties. The evidence indicates that obesity may
affect both types of static property. Gravitational
properties and mass loading have been discussed
elsewhere (10).
True elastic properties of the thorax
The significantly lower total respiratory com￾pliances of the O.H. patients reflect principally
their decreased thoracic compliances (averaging
only 35%7 of normal). The thorax is known to
become less compliant at small volumes, and cer￾tainly part of the decreased thoracic compliance
is due simply to depression of the mid-position
so that the obese subject breathes over a less
compliant portion of his thoracic volume-pressure
curve. Why this depression of the mid-position
should be more marked in the patients with the
O.H. syndrome than in the obese normal sub￾jects of nearly comparable weight is not known.
Naimark and Cherniack's data (9) show de￾creased thoracic compliances in all their obese sub￾jects, and the differences in thoracic compliance
between their obese hypoventilators and their
obese normals are not impressive.
Lung compliances were often low among the
obese, especially in the O.H. group whose mean
compliance was 42% below the average normal
value. The most tenable explanation for this in￾vokes the observations of Caro, Butler, and Du￾bois (27) and of McIlroy, Butler, and Finley
(28) in which chest strapping decreased lung
compliance in normal subjects. Their observa￾tions dealt with the acute effects of strapping,
and the compliance changes were attributed to
closure or collapse of alveolar units. The chronic
effects of mass loading should produce similar
changes possibly with irreversible collapse of
alveoli.
Resistances
Whereas separate methods gave similar total
respiratory compliance values, in the case of the
two total resistance methods each gave different
results, tank respirator values running two or
three times the oscillatory values. Difference in
pulmonary or thoracic resistance due to differ￾ence in body position is an unlikely explanation
because of the small changes in pulmonary and
total respiratory resistance (oscillatory method)
associated with change from sitting to supine posi￾tion. Close correspondence between pulmonary
resistance as measured during oscillatory measure￾ments and at lower breathing frequencies indicates
that the methodologic discrepancy is in the thor￾acic rather than pulmonary component of total
respiratory resistance. Absence of expiratory
muscle potentials during tank respirator resist￾ance measurements makes it unlikely that active
expiratory muscle opposition is producing spuri￾ously high inspiratory resistances, although this
possibility is not absolutely excluded because of
limitations of surface recording and incomplete
sampling of respiratory muscle activity.
A twentyfold difference in volume displacement
per measurement cycle (1 L and 50 ml, respec￾tively, for tank respirator and oscillatory meth￾ods) implies greater passive stretching of respira￾tory muscles in the respirator method which might
produce higher thoracic resistances. Lastly the
736

RESPIRATORY WORK IN OBESITY
difference might be related to the difference in
frequency at which the measurements were made.
Since these studies were completed, Mead (29)
has found that thoracic resistance in normal sub￾jects indeed appears to vary with frequency, be￾coming greater at low frequencies and less at
higher frequencies. This may explain most of the
discrepancy between results of the two resistance
methods and suggests that the tank respirator
resistance values may be the more pertinent to the
spontaneously breathing subject.
Respiratory work
The close correspondence between total com￾pliance values by the cycling versus the mid-posi￾tion shift method (Figure 5) suggests that the
cycling method correctly determines total respira￾tory compliance and therefore also the elastic com￾ponent of total respiratory work. Although a
similar internal corroboration of total resistance
methods is lacking, the tank respirator method
probably gives a reasonably close estimate of the
respective component of total respiratory work
(see above). Electromyographic silence observed
during cycling respiratory work measurements
also supports their validity. Absolute validifica￾tion of work measurements obviously awaits com￾parison of measurements made during voluntary
relaxation with measurements made after phar￾macologic paralysis of the respiratory muscles in
the same subjects.
Comparison with data of others
Table III compares our mean values for the
compliance and resistance of the thorax and total
respiratory system with published data from five
well done studies indicated by the references.
Only data obtained on conscious normal and
obese males are given. Also included is the nor￾mal total inspiratory work value reported by
Otis, Fenn, and Rahn (18).
Summary
1) Total respiratory mechanics were measured
in eight normal subjects, ten obese subjects, and
four patients with the obesity-hypoventilation
(O.H.) syndrome. Total respiratory compli￾ance was significantly decreased in both obese
groups, averaging 0.081 + 0.007 in obese nor￾mal subjects and 0.045 + 0.003 in the O.H. pa￾tients as compared to 0.104 + 0.005 L per cm
H20 in the normal subjects. The decreased total
compliance in the O.H. group was due principally
to lowered thoracic compliance.

2) Results of two methods of measuring total
respiratory compliance were highly correlated (r
+ 0.93).
3) Although total respiratory resistance is
somewhat increased in the obese, the amount of
increase is not clear. Two independent methods
for measuring total respiratory resistance gave
disparate results. Differences in the frequencies
at which the measurements are made are probably
responsible for this methodologic discrepancy, al￾though the effects of respiratory muscle activity
have not been entirely excluded.
4) Obese normal subjects had total respiratory
work values up to twice normal and averaging 1.3
times normal. Four patients with the O.H. syn￾drome had values from 2.2 to 3.4 times the
average normal value, averaging 2.9 times normal.
