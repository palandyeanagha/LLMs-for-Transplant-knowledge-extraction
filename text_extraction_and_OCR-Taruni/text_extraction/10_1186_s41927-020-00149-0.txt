Hepatitis E Virus and rheumatic diseases:
what do rheumatologists need to know?
Salvatore Di Bartolomeo1,2* , Francesco Carubbi1,2 and Paola Cipriani1
Abstract
Background: Hepatitis E virus (HEV) represents the most common cause of acute hepatitis and jaundice in the
world. About 2 million of infection cases occur each year in Europe, mainly as autochthonous anthropozoonosis,
and HEV can be transmitted through undercooked pork meat. This infection has been linked to various extra￾hepatic manifestations, while chronic infections with a rapid development of liver failure have been described in
heavily immunosuppressed patients undergoing solid organ transplantations (SOTs), in patients with hematological
diseases or with immunodeficiency virus infection.
Main body of abstract: The purpose of this review article is to describe rheumatic manifestations related to HEV
infection and their implications for rheumatologists in the daily clinical practice. Despite recent accumulating
literature in this field, little is known about the course of the infection in patients with rheumatic diseases (RDs) and
about the impact of immunosuppressive drugs. Moreover, HEV infection can mimic RDs’ manifestations or drugs
toxicity. Specific guidelines on management are lacking and the majority of data are referred to SOTs receivers.
Conclusions: More studies are needed to better understand the real impact of HEV infection in patients with RDs,
regarding both clinical outcomes and their management.

Background
Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a non-enveloped, icosahedral,
single-stranded positive RNA virus of 27–34 nm in
diameter, that belongs to the Hepeviridae family [1, 2]. It
was isolated for the first time in 1983 after an outbreak
of fecal-oral transmitted non-A, non-B hepatitis among
Soviet troops in Afghanistan [3], and in 1990 the virus
genome was cloned [4]. It replicates in the cytoplasm of
infected cells. Although HEV is a primary hepatotropic
virus, infections of other tissues, including small intes￾tine, colon, lymph nodes, neurons, kidney and placental
tissue have been reported, partially explaining the patho￾genesis of some extra-hepatic manifestations [5–7].
HEV has a 7.2-kb genome which is organized in three
open reading frames (ORFs). ORF1 encodes non￾structural proteins involved in the replication of viral
genome (the so called “replicase”), including a methyl
transferase, a putative protease, an RNA helicase and an
RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. ORF2 encodes the
viral capsid protein and ORF3 encodes a protein in￾volved in release of viral particles from infected cells.
Antibodies against the viral capsid are neutralizing [1, 7].
Virus in the stool, after biliary excretion, is non envel￾oped, while in the bloodstream it exists as “quasi-envel￾oped”, because virions are wrapped in membranes
derived from infected cells after viral budding [7].
HEV human infections are caused by viruses belonging
to the orthohepevirus genus that encompasses four
species (A-D), of which mainly strains belonging to the
specie A are pathogenic for humans; rat HEV (group C)

has recently been described to cause acute and chronic
infections in humans, although its real epidemiological
impact is still unknown [8, 9]. A specie is, in turn, di￾vided into 8 genotypes (GT1–8), but only GT 1–4 infect
humans. The only exception was the isolation of the
GT-7 in a man who consumed Camel milk [1, 6–10].
In particular, GT1 and GT2 are humans obligate path￾ogens spread by the fecal-oral route in less developed
countries. GT3 and GT4 are the most prevalent strains
in developed countries in which the infection is now
considered mainly an anthropozoonosis, since pigs, wild
boars and deers are considered the major reservoirs of
the virus. Fruits, vegetables and seafood watered with
water contaminated by infected manure could theoretic￾ally transmit the infection, but the real epidemiological
impact of this route of infection is not known. Inter￾human infection is rare, but it seems possible through
fresh blood products from infected persons [1, 6–12].
HEV, in particular GT3, is now considered the most
common cause of acute hepatitis in high-income coun￾tries where infection is acquired as a zoonosis with pigs
and wild boars as primary hosts that, however, display
no symptoms. In Europe, about 2 million new infections
per year have been estimated to occur. The real HEV
seroprevalence is probably underestimated, and in Eur￾ope there are some “hot spots” of high prevalence such
as south of France, Pyrenees, Germany, Poland, Holland,
Scotland. In Italy, a recent research of Lucarelli et al.,
found an high seroprevalence among blood donors in
the Abruzzo region (central Italy). The prevalence was
about 49%, likely related to the consumption of raw sau￾sages since HEV shows the ability to survive in the dried
and salty meat [7, 13, 14].
The clinical features of the infection are variables.
The majority of cases are probably completely asymp￾tomatic, identified only by anti-HEV seroconversion.
In 5–10% of people a mild and self-limiting form
resembling acute hepatitis A with fatigue, nausea,
itching, jaundice and raising of liver function tests
(LFTs) may occur, more frequently in males > 60 years
of age. The Incubation period is about 3–8 weeks.
Fulminant hepatitis whit acute liver failure (ALF) is
rare, occurring in particular in patients with chronic
liver diseases, and in about 0.5–3% of young adults.
The infection during the third trimester of pregnancy
can have up to 20–30% of mortality, but probably
only for GT1 and GT2 genotypes [6, 7, 11].
Chronic infection is possible with GT3 and GT4 and
it is defined as the persistence of detectable HEV-RNA
in serum for more than 3 months, although others con￾sider the limit of 6 months, in particular in immuno￾competent patients [7, 11]. The risk of chronicity seems
particularly high (> 50%) among solid organ transplan￾tations (SOTs) receivers (SOTRs), due to anti-rejection
treatments [15, 16]. Increasing evidence reveals risk
among patients with immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in￾fection and hematological conditions, in particular
hematopoietic stem cells transplantation (HSCT), as
well as rheumatic diseases (RDs) [7, 11, 17–20]. In
these patients, chronic HEV infection can rapidly pro￾gress over 3–4 years to liver cirrhosis and ultimately
liver failure [7].
Several data reveal that HEV infection (in particular
GT3) is associated with several extra-hepatic manifes￾tations, in particular neurological, but also renal,
haematological, autoimmune and rheumatic condi￾tions [7, 11, 21–24].
The purpose of this review article is to describe
rheumatic manifestations related to HEV infection and
their implications for rheumatologists in daily clinical
practice. In particular, we designed a comprehensive
literature search on this topic, by a review of reported
published articles in indexed international journals until
30 November 2019, following proposed guidelines for
preparing a biomedical narrative review [25].
HEV as a cause of rheumatic manifestations
The precise pathogenesis of HEV-associated rheumatic
manifestations (RMs) is largely unknown and probably
multifactorial. HEV, like other pathogens, could act
through molecular mimicy inducing autoimmunity in gen￾etically predisposed hosts. A direct action of HEV on the
immune system, as in other forms of reactive arthritis, is
also possible, since HEV can replicate in various cell types.
For example, in some cases of Guillan-Barrè Syndrome
(GBS), HEV-RNA has been isolated from serum and cere￾brospinal fluid with a “quasi-species” compartmentalization
of neurotropic strains [7, 24, 26, 27]. Similarly to HCV,
HEV can trigger the production of cryoglobulines; in par￾ticular, anti-HEV IgM and IgG and HEV-RNA was isolated
in the cryoprecipitate of patients with cryoglobulinaemia
[28]. HEV can, thus, trigger an autoimmune response that
may explain the occurrence of mixed cryoglobulinaemia
(MC) after viral clearance [28, 29].
Many infectious agents, including HEV, are believed
to act as triggers in the pathogenesis of both cutane￾ous necrotizing small-vessel vasculitis (CNSVV) and
Henoch-Schönlein Purpura (HSP). Vessel inflamma￾tion may occur as a consequence of direct viral repli￾cation, type II or immune complex-mediated (type III)
reaction and/or cell-mediated retarded hypersensitiv￾ity response (type IV) [30]. In this context, viral
eradication can be useful in reducing clinical manifes￾tations. A reduction of proteinuria and an improve￾ment of renal function after viral clearance (obtained
either spontaneously or after medical treatment) has
been reported in patients with glomerulonephritis
associated with active HEV infection [7, 31].
Bartolomeo et al. BMC Rheumatology (2020) 4:51 Page 2 of 10

HEV infection can be associated with various rheum￾atic complaints. Musculoskeletal involvement, such as
arthralgia and myalgia can be present during acute hepa￾titis, even in the absence of jaundice [7, 32–35]. Associ￾ation with acute polyarthritis [36, 37], that probably
represent a form of reactive and self-limiting arthritis,
has also been described.
Although cryoglobulinaemia is associated with hepa￾titis C virus (HCV), many recent reports describe the
association between HEV and MC (Type II or III). MC
seems to occur in patients with chronic infection, in
particular SOTRs under immunosuppressive treatments,
although Guinautl at al. described a case of MC in a
non-immunocompromised patient with HEV infection.
Clinical manifestations range from mild to severe forms
[7, 21, 24, 36–38], with or without renal and musculo￾skeletal involvement. Moreover, a case of HEV￾associated cryoglobulinaemia with myalgias, rash,
arthralgia has been reported also in a liver transplant
recipient [39].
One case of HSP occurred in a 6 years old girl with
an acute HEV infection [40], while a case of CNSVV
has been described in an adult with evidence of HEV
infection [30]. Both cases had a favorable and self￾limiting course requiring only supportive therapy with
the resolution of vasculitis after the viral clearance.
HEV infection has also been associated with myocar￾ditis [41], autoimmune thyroiditis [42], autoimmune
hepatitis (where HEV could probably either trigger
the development of autoimmunity or simulate both
clinical and serological features of autoimmune
hepatitis) [43–46], multiplex mononeuropathy,
Parsonage-Turner Syndrome, GBS and other neuro￾logical manifestations [7, 24].
Specific guidelines for the management of HEV￾related RMs are lacking and therapeutic choices depend
on clinical severity. As their course is frequently self￾limiting, patients might only need symptomatic therap￾ies. Eradication of the virus, through either reduction of
the immunosuppressive therapy, where feasible, or ad￾ministration of antiviral treatments (e.g. ribavirin), could
speed up the recovery of patients, as demonstrated in
HEV-associated glomerulonephritis. However, in refrac￾tory and most severe cases, specific immunosuppressive
treatment as for non HEV-induced RMs is needed, in
adjunction to viral eradication, according to the relevant
guidelines for each disease [7, 24, 28, 31].
HEV in patients with a rheumatic disease
HEV infection can occur in patients with RDs leading to
different possible consequences.
The infection can simulate a flare of the disease
leading to an unnecessary, and potentially harmful,
increase of the immunosuppressive therapy [7, 32–37].
Moreover, the alterations in LFTs due to the infection
should be differentiated from those of other etiology that
can occur in patients with rheumatic disease such as
drug toxicity (e.g. Methotrexate (MTX)), liver involve￾ment by the rheumatic disease itself, concomitant
autoimmune hepatitis, infections (of either opportunistic
or non-opportunistic etiology) [10, 47–51]. In particular,
recently we reported a case of a woman, affected by
rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who developed fatigue, diffuse
itching and increased LFTs soon after the introduction
on leflunomide (LEF) and that, subsequently, resulted
positive for acute HEV infection. LEF was stopped and
restarted after 5 months, when viral clearance has oc￾curred. LFTs remained normal ruling out the possibility
of drug toxicity [34].
The high risk of developing chronic infections with a
rapid progression to liver cirrhosis among SOTRs and
other heavily immunosuppressed patients is well know
and represents a clinical challenge [7, 15, 16, 52]. In the
last years, patients with rheumatic diseases are increas￾ingly treated with biological disease-modifying antirheu￾matic drugs (b-DMARDs) or targeted synthetic (ts-)
DMARDs with or without conventional synthetic (cs-)
DMARDs. The risk of HBV and HCV reactivation
during immunosuppressive treatment with cs-, b- or ts￾DMARDS and corticosteroids for various RDs is well
established [53, 54].
Despite the increasing evidence on HEV infection in
rheumatic diseases, the course of the disease has not
been fully elucidated.
We found a total of 60 cases of HEV infection
(Table 1) occurring in immunosuppressed patients,
treated with DMARDs, other than SOT receivers,HIV
carriers or having undergone HSCT [20, 28, 55–59].
In a recent literature review, 26 cases of HEV infection
occurred during the treatment of RA [55]. Twenty
patients were treated with ts- or b-DMARDs with or
without cs-DMARDs, 6 patients with cs-DMARDs alone,
namely MTX, LEF, bucillamine, mizoribine, actarit and
tacrolimus (TAC) while low-dose steroids were used in
16 cases. Interestingly in the majority of cases HEV
clearance and LFTs improvement occurred soon after
the withdrawal of DMARDs without adding anti-viral
therapy. One patient died because of acute liver failure
and one patient, who continued adalimumab therapy,
developed a chronic infection that resolved after adali￾mumab withdrawal and ribavirin treatment. In other 3
cases ribavirin was used with a rapid eradication of the
virus (< 3 months), interestingly these patients were re￾ceiving Rituximab (RTX) with or without MTX [55]. In
a French multicenter retrospective study among patients
with various chronic inflammatory arthritis, 23 cases of
HEV infections were reported [56]. Treatments included
discontinuation of immunosuppressant in 20 patients

and ribavirin treatment in 5 patients (1 with RA, 1 with
Juvenile idiopathic arthritis, 2 with Psoriatic arthritis
(PsA), 1 with ankylosing spondylitis). None of the pa￾tients developed chronic infection and/or fulminant
hepatitis, 1 patient with PsA developed bilateral
Parsonage-Turner Syndrome (#35) [56].
A recent European multicenter retrospective Cohort
study reported 21 cases of HEV infections among pa￾tients with different systemic diseases, including RA
(n = 5), PsA (n = 4), other variants of chronic arthritis
(n = 4), primary immunodeficiency (n = 3), systemic
granulomatosis (n = 2), systemic lupus erythematosus
(n = 1), Erdheim–Chester disease (n = 1), and retroperi￾toneal fibrosis (n = 1) [57]. Chronic infection (lasting> 3
months) developed in seven (33%) patients. In particular,
they reported the development of chronic infection in
two (40%) patients with RA, 3 (100%) with primary im￾munodeficiency, one (100%) with retroperitoneal fibrosis
and one patient (100%) with systemic granulomatosis.
They were treated with MTX monotherapy (n = 2),

HEV-RNA clearance after introduction of ribavirin
Bartolomeo et al. BMC Rheumatology (2020) 4:51 Page 5 of 10

Mycophenolate Mofetil (MMF)/prednisone (n = 1), siro￾limus/prednisone (n = 1). Overall 38% cleared the infec￾tion after reduction of the immunosuppressant therapy,
52% after treatment with ribavirin (no standard dose
and/or regimen were used), one patient was lost at
follow-up (5%), and one patient (5%), with primary
immunedeficiency, relapsed after initial successful re￾sponse to ribavirin (#49). No patients died from hepatic
complications [20].
Abignano et al. described a patient treated with RTX
and MMF for Sjögren’s syndrome who developed a
chronic HEV infection. Anti-HEV IgM and IgG were
both negative, probably due to the effect of RTX on the
humoral immunity, but HEV-RNA was positive in the
stool. HEV-RNA disappeared after introduction of riba￾virin, but the infection relapsed after ribavirin suspen￾sion [57].
Our knowledge is limited about HEV infection in the
field of inflammatory bowel diseases. Recently two case
reports have been published. One case of a self-limiting
infection in a patient with ulcerative colitis [58], and 1
unusual case of HEV GT1 infection in a patient with
Chron’s disease treated with mercaptopurine, adalimu￾mab and prednisolone who seems to have developed a
prolonged course (however in this case, chronic infec￾tion is not well documented) [59, 60].
No data are currently available about a possible role of
HEV in causing Osteoporosis and/or Osteomalacia.
Treatment of HEV infection in patients with RDs
In the case of HEV infection occurring during immunosup￾pressive treatment for RDs, specific guidelines developed
for rheumatic patients, are lacking. However, data are accu￾mulating and the outcome seems favorable in the majority
of cases [20], but chronicity can occur [57]. In mild and
self-limiting infections (with HEV-RNA clearance within 3
months), only supportive measures are needed with a thor￾ough follow-up. It could be useful, if feasible, to reduce the
immunosuppressive therapy for a short while in order to
promote viral clearance [34]. In cases of severe acute hepa￾titis, treatment with ribavirin could rapidly improve liver
function (these data come from studies in immunosup￾pressed patients with other diseases) [7]. Corticosteroids
have been added in cases of ALF with positive effects, how￾ever more data are needed [7, 61].
In the case of chronic infection (with HEV-RNA being
detectable for over 3 months), it could be advisable to
follow the guidelines for SOTRs or for hematological pa￾tients proposed by Mallet et al. [7, 62] and discontinue
and/or reduce the DMARDs, if feasible. This approach
led to viral clearance in about 1/3 of cases of HEV in
SOTRs [1, 7].
Subsequently, according to the patient characteristics,
the introduction of ribavirin could be considered. Several
different schemes of treatment have been used in the
past [59], but the one recently proposed by the European
Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) practice
guidelines (600 mg/d for 12 weeks) seems preferable
since it allowed to achieve sustained virological response
(SVR) in 78% of SOTRs. In cases of early relapse, a 6-
month course of ribavirin can be used. In ribavirin re￾sistant and/or intolerant patients, treatment is difficult.
A 3-month course of PEGylated-interferon-a has been
used in liver transplant patients. However, it could be
harmful in autoimmune diseases and so its usefulness is
dubious. Sofosbuvir has some anti-HEV actions in vitro,
however, in vivo results are conflicting [7, 63].
Practical considerations
HEV is a ubiquitous virus with two distinct epidemio￾logic features: i. GT1 and GT2 is characterized by out￾breaks in endemic areas (e.g. Asia), mainly causes acute
infections and is linked to the consumption of inad￾equately sanitized water; ii. GT3 and GT4 is more
spread in developed countries were it represents an
autochthonous anthropozoonosis [1, 6, 7, 34].
,HEV infection incidence in Europe has an average
rate of 19.16% (7.5–31.9%) [14], probably underesti￾mated, due to high frequency of asymptomatic cases and
the lack of its awareness by physicians. A recent review
article reported a seroprevalence ranging from 0.12 to
49% in Italy, probably due to variability in test sensitivity
and dietary habits [64]. In particular, in the Abruzzo re￾gion the high prevalence of the infection, caused by
GT3, seems to occur as a locally acquired anthropozoo￾nosis related to the ingestion of locally-bred under￾cooked pork meat [13, 64, 65].
HEV can have a profound impact in the rheumatologic
daily practice, and we do not completely know the
course of the infection in patients with RDs and/or
under immunosuppressive therapy [34]. However, we
suggest some practical indications (Fig. 1):
1) Considering and searching for HEV during the
initial diagnostic workup of a patient with a suspect
of reactive arthritis or a possible extra-hepatic
manifestation of HEV, in particular if accompanied
by abnormality in LFTs.
2) Thinking about HEV in the differential diagnosis of
a patient receiving drugs for a rheumatic disease,
with persistent elevation in LFTs or with acute
hepatitis. This could allow to rule out drug-induced
liver injury thus avoid the withdrawal of an effective
treatment, as it was the case for our patient and in
others case reports [12, 34, 49], or prevent an un￾necessary strengthening of the immunosuppressive
therapy for an erroneous diagnosis of autoimmune
hepatitis.

3) When HEV infection occurs during
immunosuppressive therapy, it is important to test
such patients for both antibodies and HEV-RNA in
the blood and in the stool because immunocom￾promised patients could not be able to produce de￾tectable antibodies or can have a delayed
seroconversion, leading to false negative results
when only serological methods are used [1, 7, 52].
Moreover, the outcome of patients varies according
to the type of immunosuppressants used, with the
more powerful regimens carrying the highest risk of
chronicity. In particular, calcineurin and mTOR in￾hibitors seem to stimulate, while mycophenolic acid
could inhibit viral replication and corticosteroids
should not interfere with viral clearance [1, 7]. In
highly selected cases, it could be reasonable, where

possible, to change DMARD, e.g. switching from a
calcineurin or mTOR inhibitor to MMF due to its
anti-viral in vitro effect, however in vivo data are
lacking.
There are not specific predictive factors for chronicity
in rheumatic patients. Prior studies in SOTRs have
found an increased risk with a more profound immuno￾suppression characterized by reduced levels of CD2,
CD3, CD4, use of TAC, lower serum levels of
interleukin-1 receptor antagonist and interleukin-2 re￾ceptor, and increased serum concentration of chemo￾kines involved in liver leukocyte recruitment, such as
RANTES, MIP-1, MCP-1 and CXCL8 [1]. GT4 seems to
be more virulent than Gt3 [55].
Teeatment with TAC and presence of thrombocytopenia
were independent predictive factors for chronic HEV infec￾tion in SOTRs in a previous multicentre study [1, 66]. In
addition, transplanted patients who developed chronic
disease have had greater heterogeneity of HEV as a “quasi￾species”, in relation to those that had spontaneous reso￾lution [1, 67]. These observations are not specifically
referred to rheumatic patients and the risk likely varies
according with the diverse RDs that carry different im￾munological impairment.
Close monitoring of the patient is advisable, in order
to promptly introduce the anti-viral therapy and to
monitor treatments’ outcome.
An infectious diseases specialist should be consulted
for the tailoring of treatment and a shared management
of the patient. Finally, DMARDs can be safely reintro￾duced after confirmation of virus clearance and recovery
of the liver function [34].
Prevention of HEV infection is complex. In vitro data
suggest that HEV can be inactivated by heating at 70 °C
for more than 2 min or at 80 °C for one minute, while
at room temperature it can remain active for up to 28
days [7, 68], so it could be useful to avoid undercooked
pork meat in high risk patients from highly endemic re￾gions. A vaccine against HEV was licensed in China in
2011 showing an efficacy of 97% in preventing acute
hepatitis. It is a recombinant vaccine produced by a
portion of the ORF 2 of the Gt1 and induces neutraliz￾ing antibodies that persist up to 4–5 years. It is admin￾istered with a 3 dose schedule (0, 1, and 6 months). Its
capability to prevent also Gt4 symptomatic infection
may suggest a cross-reactivity. However, it is not
licensed in Europe and USA ad clinical trials are
ongoing [1, 7, 68–70].
In Italy, blood donors screening for HEV is not rou￾tinely performed in the daily clinical practice (like in
other countries) and an extensive screening might be
very expensive. However, such approach could be advis￾able, at least in high endemic regions, for blood products
to be used in immunocompromised patients at higher
risk of infection.
Conclusion
HEV infection is increasingly recognized among rheu￾matologic patients. Clinicians should think about it in
the presence of liver damage or in the context of a pos￾sible extrahepatic manifestation occurring with LFTs ab￾normalities, in particular in high prevalence areas.
Further studies are needed to better understand the
course of the infection in such patients and to develop
specific management guidelines. Moreover, future stud￾ies should evaluate the utility of screening programs in
patients needing to be treated with DMARDs and assess
the cost effectiveness of preventive measures such as
avoiding undercooked pork meat, vaccination, and ex￾tensive screening of blood products.
