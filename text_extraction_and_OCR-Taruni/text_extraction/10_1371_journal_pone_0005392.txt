Abstract
Anti-b-glucan antibodies elicited by a laminarin-conjugate vaccine confer cross-protection to mice challenged with major
fungal pathogens such as Candida albicans, Aspergillus fumigatus and Cryptococcus neoformans. To gain insights into
protective b-glucan epitope(s) and protection mechanisms, we studied two anti-b-glucan monoclonal antibodies (mAb)
with identical complementarity-determining regions but different isotypes (mAb 2G8, IgG2b and mAb 1E12, IgM). C.
albicans, the most relevant fungal pathogen for humans, was used as a model. Both mAbs bound to fungal cell surface
and to the b1,3-b1,6 glucan of the fungal cell wall skeleton, as shown by immunofluorescence, electron-microscopy and
ELISA. They were also equally unable to opsonize fungal cells in a J774 macrophage phagocytosis and killing assay.
However, only the IgG2b conferred substantial protection against mucosal and systemic candidiasis in passive vaccination
experiments in rodents. Competition ELISA and microarray analyses using sequence-defined glucan oligosaccharides
showed that the protective IgG2b selectively bound to b1,3-linked (laminarin-like) glucose sequences whereas the non￾protective IgM bound to b1,6- and b1,4-linked glucose sequences in addition to b1,3-linked ones. Only the protective IgG2b
recognized heterogeneous, polydisperse high molecular weight cell wall and secretory components of the fungus, two of
which were identified as the GPI-anchored cell wall proteins Als3 and Hyr1. In addition, only the IgG2b inhibited in vitro two
critical virulence attributes of the fungus, hyphal growth and adherence to human epithelial cells. Our study demonstrates
that the isotype of anti-b-glucan antibodies may affect details of the b-glucan epitopes recognized, and this may be
associated with a differing ability to inhibit virulence attributes of the fungus and confer protection in vivo. Our data also
suggest that the anti-virulence properties of the IgG2b mAb may be linked to its capacity to recognize b-glucan epitope(s)
on some cell wall components that exert critical functions in fungal cell wall structure and adherence to host cells.

Introduction
Diseases caused by fungi are increasingly impacting on the
health of populations, particularly constituting a large fraction of
health care-associated infections. Subject categories at high risk of
fungal infection are cancer patients under immunosuppressive
chemotherapy, subjects undergoing major surgery and critically-ill
patients under supportive ventilation and bearing central venous
and urinary catheters [1–3]. Both diagnosis and antifungal therapy
are of limited effectiveness in these patients, resulting into
treatment failures and associated mortality [2,4,5]. In addition,
the spectrum of fungal pathogens has enlarged to include yeasts
and moulds that are refractory to most antifungals, posing
remarkable challenges to infection control measures [1,3,6].
In this context, it is much hoped that immuno-prophylactic or -
therapeutic treatments will be developed to drastically reduce the
incidence of fungal infections and resulting mortality. Toward
these goals, antibody-eliciting antifungal vaccines or antibody￾based treatments have recently gained particular appeal [7–12].
There is now a firm experimental evidence that some antibodies
can exert a significant antifungal defensive action [7,8,12–14].
Experience with anti-bacterial or anti-viral vaccines in current use
suggests that vaccines that induce protective antibodies may be
more easily generated and standardized as compared to those
inducing protection by cell-mediated immunity. On the other
hand, development of clinically useful antifungal antibodies may
profit from the on-going outstanding advances in recombinant
DNA technologies and protein engineering.
Remarkable progress has been made recently in the discovery of
fungal antigens that confer antibody-mediated protection. There
are several examples of experimental subunit vaccines that are
able to prevent some of the most widespread fungal infections
PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 April 2009 | Volume 4 | Issue 4 | e5392

through the induction of protective antibodies. Some of these
appear particularly promising [12,15–21]. The feasibility of
conferring passive protection through administration of protective
antibodies, with or without antimycotic therapy, is also being
investigated actively. A number of monoclonal or recombinant
antifungal antibodies are available, which have proven to be
protective in preclinical or clinical models of passive vaccination
against some fungal infections [19,20,22–28].
It is of particular interest that several protective antifungal
antibodies appear to provide protection by blocking virulence
factors [17,18,21,25,29–31] or by directly affecting fungus growth
[20,23,32]. This mode of action, which is independent of help by
the host immunity, would be particularly advantageous in the
setting of the immunocompromized hosts, who are at major risk of
severe fungal infections.
Presently, researchers in the field are optimistic that antifungal
vaccines and antibodies of clinical usefulness will be soon
generated [7–9,11,12]. For success, however, it is necessary to
identify precisely antibodies and antigens that can generate a
protective immunity and to elucidate the mechanisms of immune
protection, also in consideration of the large variability of
protective value among antifungal antibodies with similar or even
equal antigen specificity [9,10,12,33–35]. Among the most
recently described subunit vaccines and antifungal antibodies,
those targeting major polysaccharides or polysaccharide-associated
proteins of the fungal cell wall have been shown to exert protection
in various experimental models of fungal infection, both in normal
and in immunocompromized animals [15,17–20,22,25,27–
29,36,37].
In particular, a number of mannan or b-glucan protein
conjugates vaccines have shown efficacy in experimental models
of candidiasis, aspergillosis and cryptococcosis, the three most
prevalent fungal infections of humans [15,18,20,29,36]. One of
these candidate vaccines, composed by laminarin (b1,3-glucan)
conjugated with the genetically-inactivated diphtheria toxin
CRM197 (Lam-CRM vaccine) has been found to induce the
production of anti-b-glucan antibodies capable of conferring
protection against all three the above infections, showing for the
first time that it is possible to immunize with a single antigen
against evolutionarily distant, unrelated infectious agents such as
Candida, Aspergillus and Cryptococcus spp. [20 and Vecchiarelli et al,
personal communication]. The same broad protective specificity
was shown by mAb 2G8, a laminarin-recognizing, anti-b-glucan
IgG2b monoclonal antibody, which was able to control infections
by C. albicans and C. neoformans. [20,22]. As for other promising
antifungal vaccines and antibodies, however, details of the
antigenic determinants and effector mechanisms of the protective
immunity provided by the b-glucan-based vaccine and anti- b￾glucan mAbs remain largely elusive.
In this paper, we have tried to gain insights into the mechanisms
of protection induced by anti-b-glucan antibodies by comparing
the anti-b-glucan mAb 2G8 with a mAb (named 1E12) which has
equal sequences of light and heavy chain Complementarity
Determining Regions (CDRs) as the IgG, but is of different
isotype (IgM). C. albicans, the most widespread agent of fungal
disease in humans, has been used as a test model in our
investigations.
Results
Anti-b-glucan mAb 2G8 and 1E12 and their binding to
fungal cell wall
In the search for protective anti-b-glucan antibodies analogous
to those elicited by the Lam-CRM vaccine, we generated a
number of anti-b-glucan murine monoclonal antibodies. The
mAbs 2G8 and 1E12, belonging, respectively, to the IgG2b and
the IgM class, were selected for further studies. In preliminary
experiments, both mAbs were found to specifically react in ELISA
with isolated fungal b-glucans from C. albicans or Saccharomyces
cerevisiae, while not recognizing at all a-linked glucans or fungal (C.
albicans or S. cerevisiae) mannans (data not shown). The deduced
amino acid sequences of variable regions of the two mAbs (Table 1)
showed a complete identity of their three heavy and light chain
CDRs.
Both antibodies were found to bind to C. albicans germ-tubes
(hyphal precursors) and A. fumigatus hyphae (Figure 1, panel A, a–
b; e–f). They also bound to a proportion of poorly encapsulated C.
neoformans cells (which display b-glucan on their surface) and C.
albicans yeast cells, although with large cell to cell variations in
labelling intensity (Figure 1, Panel A, c–d; g–h).
MAb binding to C. albicans cell surface was then examined in
more detail by immuno-electron microscopy analysis of criofixed,
ultrathin sections, a type of preparation which is believed to
optimally preserve cellular components in their native state. Fig. 1,
panel B, a–d shows discrete, non uniform levels of gold
immunolabelling for both IgG- and IgM-reactive material
throughout the thicker cell wall of the yeast and the thinner cell
wall of the hyphae. Gold particles were also present at the cell
surface of both yeast and hyphal cells, and both in IgM- and in
IgG-labelled sections (Figure 1, panel B). Quantitative assessment
of the number of gold particles per cell wall area did not reveal
statistically significant differences between IgM- and IgG labelling
( data not shown)
The IgG and the IgM anti-b-glucan mAbs confer different
degrees of protection in experimental models of C.
albicans infection
We have previously reported that the IgG mAb 2G8 is able to
control infections by C. albicans or C. neoformans in different animal
models [20,22]. As in experimental fungal diseases there are a few
but well established examples of antibodies whose protective value
is modulated depending on the isotype [33,38], we wondered
whether, and to what extent, the anti-b-glucan IgM was also
protective. To assess this issue, we carried out comparative
protection assays with the two mAbs in different experimental
models of C. albicans infection.
As predicted from previous work [20], a single pre-challenge
treatment with the IgG mAb 2G8 significantly reduced fungal
invasion of kidneys in infected animals. In contrast, parallel
treatment of mice with the IgM mAb 1E12 was ineffective, as
observed in three independent experiments with different C.
albicans infecting doses (Fig. 2, panel A). A similar result was
obtained in experiments measuring survival of mice treated with
either mAb and challenged with a highly lethal, intravenous dose
of fungal cells. In these experiments, a single injection of the IgG
mAb was found to induce a slight but significant increase of
survival rates and a significantly prolonged median survival times
of treated animals, whereas mice receiving the IgM mAb died with
rate and extent similar to saline-receiving controls (Fig. 2, B).
The two mAbs were also tested for protection in a well￾established, self-healing model of rat experimental vaginitis in
which animals received a ‘‘therapeutic’’ antibody treatment 1, 24
and 48 h post-intravaginal infection. As shown in Fig. 2, panel C,
rats treated with the IgG mAb exhibited an accelerated fungal
clearance from the vagina, with CFU values significantly lower
than those found in control animals at all time points, and an
earlier resolution of the vaginal infection (indicated by CFU￾negative vaginal fluid cultures on day 28). In comparison, the IgM
Anti-b-Glucan mAbs
PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 April 2009 | Volume 4 | Issue 4 | e5392

mAb only caused some accelerated, statistically significant, decay
of the vaginal fungus burden at early time points (#5 days), but
not at later time points, and was not able to accelerate the
eradication of C. albicans from the vagina.
The two mAbs were therefore compared for their ability to
opsonize fungal cells, thus promoting their phagocytosis and killing
by phagocytic cells. Opsonisation is a critical property of protective
anti-Candida antibodies [39] and, as shown above, some b-glucan
constituents, bound by both the IgG and the IgM mAb, were
present on cell wall surface (Figure 1). In a CFU count-based
killing assay using the murine macrophage cell line J774 (Fig. 2,
panel D) both mAbs were unable to increase the anti-Candida
activity of murine cells, in marked contrast with a positive control,
an anti-C. albicans mannoprotein serum, which proved effectively
opsonic.
Taken together, the results from protection experiments in two
very different experimental models of candidiasis consistently
highlighted a remarkable anti-C. albicans protective potential for
the IgG mAb and little or no protective activity for the IgM mAb.
The results also indicated that this difference in protective activity
was unlikely to depend on differing opsonisation properties of the
two mAbs.
Both the IgG and the IgM mAbs recognize fungal b￾glucan but they differ in fine epitope recognition
The data reported above invited to investigate other properties
of the two mAbs that could account for their different protective
capacity, including possible differences in fine antigenic recogni￾tion. This, in fact, could be modulated by the isotype-related
constant region, as observed for other antibodies [40–44]. We
started by examining any differential recognition of the two
isomeric b1,3 and b1,6-glucan sequences, which are both present
and intermixed in fungal b-glucans. Initial experiments were
performed by ELISA and competition ELISA assays, using various
b-glucan poly- and oligosaccharides. Figure 3, panel A, shows a
comparison of dose-response mAb binding to laminarin, a b1,3-
linked linear glucan molecule with occasional b 1,6 branches of
glucose [45], pustulan, a b1,6-linked, linear glucan [46] and to
soluble, purified C. albicans b-glucan (a highly branched glucan
with mixed b1,3- and b1,6-linked components, also referred to as
GG-Zym [47]). The data indicated that the IgG recognized
strongly laminarin, and only weakly, at high antibody concentra￾tion, pustulan. In contrast, the IgM bound both to laminarin
(though less strongly than the IgG) and pustulan. The binding of
the two mAbs to Candida b-glucan (GG-Zym) was rather similar, in
keeping with the mixed b-1,3 and b-1,6 sequences in this glucan.
Curve fit analysis and comparison of slopes confirmed a significant
difference between IgG and IgM binding curves to laminarin
(P,0.0001) and pustulan (P = 0.003), but not to GG-Zym (Fig 3,
panel A).
ELISA competition assays were performed to gain preliminary
insights into specific oligosaccharide structures of fungal glucan
recognized by the two antibodies. GG-Zym was used as the
plastic-bound antigen and laminarin, pustulan and a number of
b1,3- or b1,6-linked oligosaccharides with a degree of polymer￾ization (DP) 2 to 7 were assayed in liquid-phase as inhibitors of the
mAbs. As shown in Fig. 3, panel B, binding of the IgG mAb to
GG-Zym was almost abolished in the presence of laminarin and
strongly inhibited by b1,3-linked oligosaccharides, but unaffected
by b1,6-linked oligosaccharides. In contrast, the binding of the
IgM mAb was strongly inhibited by pustulan and, with decreasing
magnitude at decreasing of DP, by b1,6-linked oligosaccharides,
and also by b1,3-linked oligosaccharides, particularly by di-tri- and
tetra-glucosides (Fig. 3, panel B).
These data prompted us to carry out a more detailed
characterization of the epitopes recognized by the two mAbs
using microarray analyses. The arrays contained five series of
linear glucan oligosaccharides of different configurations and DP
(up to 13 glucose units) arrayed as neoglycolipids (Fig. 4). The IgG
mAb bound to the laminarin-type oligosaccharides containing the
b1,3 linkage, starting from a minimum DP of 4, and the binding
strength increased with increasing oligosaccharide chain length
(maximum binding to octaose, then plateauing) (Fig. 4, A). There
was little or no binding to the oligosaccharides from maltodextrins

that there was unexplained moderate binding to the trisaccharide
probe from pustulan. In contrast, the IgM mAb bound not only to
the b1,3 oligosaccharides but also to those with b1,4 and b1,6
linkages (Fig. 4, B). Coherently with the ELISA data (Fig. 3), the
specific activity of the IgM antibody toward the b1,3-linked
oligosaccharides was lower than that of the IgG mAb: the signals
given in Fig. 4A and B were elicited with 0.1 and 0.5 mg/ml of the

mAb-treated mice. In each of these experiments, groups of three mice were passively immunized by the i.p. route with 100 mg/0.5 ml of the IgG or
IgM anti-b-glucan mAb, as indicated whereas control mice (three per group) received 0.5 ml of PBS only (Experiments 1 and 2) or 100 mg/0.5 ml of an
irrelevant IgG2b mAb (Experiment 3). Two hours post passive immunization, the animals were infected i.v. with C. albicans (56105

cells/mouse, Exp 3) and extent of fungal invasion was evaluated at day 2 post-challenge thruogh CFU enumeration in left kidney. The asterisks
indicate a statistically significant difference (P,0.05) in mean CFU number/kidney in the corresponding group of animals as compared to the PBS￾treated (experiments 1 and 2) or to the irrelevant mAb-treated group (experiment 3). Panel B: Survival of mice given a single, prophylactic
administration of the anti-b-glucan mAbs and lethally infected with C. albicans. Mice (7 per group) were administered a single dose of the indicated
mAb (150 mg/0.5 ml, i.p.) or 0.5 ml of PBS and, 2 h later, received a lethal challenge with C. albicans (106 cells/mouse, i.v.). Log rank test indicated
statistically significant differences between survival curves of PBS- and IgG- and between those of IgG- and IgM-treated animals, but no significant
difference between PBS- and IgM- treated mice. Panel C: Protection by the anti-b-glucan mAbs in a rat model of vulvovaginal candidiasis. The graph

irrelevant mAb (40 mg/200 ml at 1, 24 and 48 hours post-infection) or with PBS alone (200 ml, same schedule). The experiment was repeated twice
with similar results. Panel D: Evaluation of the opsonic activity of the mAbs. C. albicans killing by J774 murine macrophages was assessed by a classical

IgG and IgM mAb, respectively. Taken together the ELISA
inhibition and the glycoarray data showed that the IgG mAb has a
greater specific activity and a more restricted specificity for the
b1,3 glucan sequence than the IgM mAb.
IgG mAb-reactive, IgM mAb unreactive cell wall and
secretory proteins
Notoriously, fungal cells release abundant b-glucan during their
growth in vitro and in vivo, so that b-glucan detection in patients’
serum is valued as a diagnostic marker of invasive fungal infections
[48]. We therefore assayed supernatants of C. albicans cultures for
reactivity with the IgG or the IgM mAb. In ELISA experiments
(Fig. 5, panel A), we observed that the material progressively
released during growth by both yeasts and hyphae of C. albicans
contained mAb-reactive b-glucan material which was, however,
much more reactive with the IgG than with the IgM. This
suggested that epitope conformation of the secreted b-glucan did
not overlap with that of b-glucan expressed on cell surface, which

comparison to parallel fungus cultures without macrophages. Values in figure are means+SE of triplicate determinations. Comparable results were
obtained at different MOI (0.1:1, 1:1).

was instead rather similarly reactive with the IgM as with the IgG
(see Fig 1).
We considered that b-glucan is often secreted by fungi in
association with cell wall proteins, in particular the mannoproteins
[49], and that several cell wall proteins which are secreted into the
external milieau are known to be covalently linked to b-glucan
[50–52]. Thus, the secreted material was analyzed by SDS-PAGE
and Western blot to identify possible, discrete protein components
bearing mAb-reactive motifs. As shown in Fig 5 (Panel B),
abundant IgG-reactive material was indeed detected in both
hyphal and yeast secretion. For its highly heterogeneous and
polydisperse appearance this material likely consisted mostly of
molecularly ill-defined, variously sized polysaccharides. Nonethe￾less, a number IgG-reactive bands, in particular three bands with
an approximate molecular weight of 165, 157 and 138 kilodaltons,
were coarsely distinguishable within the smear. Apparently similar
mAb 2G8-reactive, faint bands were also detected among cell wall
proteins extracted by SDS- or b-(1,3)-glucanase treatment from
isolated fungal cell wall (Fig. 5B), suggesting that the IgG-reactive,
secreted proteins originated from fungal cell wall. None of the
components present in the secretory material or in the cell wall
protein extracts was recognized by the IgM mAb (Fig. 5B).

As expected from the abundance of mannoproteins in the
culture supernatant and the sensitivity of their mannan component
to periodate oxidation, the secretory material was also very
reactive with Concanavalin A, a reactivity that was completely lost
upon periodate treatment (Fig. S1). Oxidation also affected some
IgG mAb-reactive constituents, but it left completely intact other
components, inclusive of those corresponding to the 157 and
138 kDal bands (Fig. S1), in keeping with the expected resistance
of b1,3 glucan to periodate oxidation.
By immuno-affinity purification onto a mAb 2G8-Protein A￾Sepharose column, the IgG mAb-reactive material was isolated
from culture supernatants yielding a fraction that comprised at
least two of the reactive bands observed in total fungal secretion, in
particular the component with an apparent molecular weight of
138 kDal (Fig. S2). Interestingly, this fraction was also recognized
by sera from mice immunized with the Lam-CRM vaccine [20],
suggesting that at least some of the anti-b-glucan antibodies
generated by this protective vaccination have the same specificity
as the protective IgG mAb (Fig. S2).
To gain insights into protein constituents associated with the
IgG-reactive, secreted b-glucan, the two bands of 138 and
157 kDal, best recognizable in the fungal secretion, were excised
from the gels, subjected to controlled proteolysis with trypsin and
analyzed by mass spectrometry. Following this approach, the
analyses of both bands yielded several peptide mass signals with
signal/noise ratio (S/N) .5. A MASCOT search was carried out
against the fungal protein sequences in the NCBInr database and
Als3 was clearly identified as a component of both bands.
Furthermore, in the 138 kDal band the search also identified the
Hyr1 protein (Table 2). The majority of the signals present in the
mass spectra (9/13 in the 157 kDal and 13/17 in the 138 kDal
band) matched with the sequences of the protein identified.
Overall, these results, coupled with those illustrated in the
previous sections, indicated that b-glucan antigenic motifs bound
by the two mAbs are expressed in the cell wall and at cell surface,
and are secreted into the external milieu. However, significantly
more IgG-reactive components are secreted, and these include
those associated with Als3 and Hyr1, two GPI-anchored cell wall
proteins that exert critical roles in cell wall assembly, growth and
fungal virulence [50–53].
The IgG mAb, but not the IgM mAb, has a direct fungal
growth-inhibitory activity and inhibits adherence of
fungal cells to mammalian epithelial cells
We have previously reported that the protective anti-b-glucan
antibodies generated by Lam-CRM vaccination could directly
inhibit fungal growth in vitro, without the contribution of any host
effector cell, a property which might greatly contribute to their
documented anti-Candida defensive action in vivo [20]. Thus, we
compared the two mAbs in growth inhibition assays where Candida
cells were treated with the mAbs for various times and then
enumerated by a standard CFU count to evaluate the mAb
inhibitory effect. Corroborating a preliminary report [20], the IgG
mAb proved efficacious in reducing fungal growth as early as after
a 4 h contact and in a dose-dependent manner. This effect became
even more pronounced after 18 h of contact. By comparison, the
IgM mAb showed little activity: at the highest concentration
(100 mg/ml) it gave a maximum of 10–30% growth inhibition,
which was well below the 70–80% afforded by the IgG at the same
concentration (Figure 6, panel A).
We also tested the two mAbs for any effects on adherence of C.
albicans hyphae to monolayers of Hep-2 cells. Following prelim￾inary dose-response experiments (not shown), the best effective
concentration of 100 mg/ml of each mAb was selected. As shown
in Figure 6, panel B, approximately 45% fewer adherent hyphae
were counted in the presence of the IgG mAb, as compared to
control epithelial cells-C. albicans co-cultures with an irrelevant
mAb (P,0.001). The IgM mAb, here again, was devoid of any
inhibitory effect.
Discussion
The salient findings in this study are: i) an IgG and an IgM anti￾b-glucan monoclonal antibody (mAb) that bound to the cell
surface of a number of pathogenic fungi and shared identical
CDRs, differed in their specificity toward b-glucan sequences; ii)
protective activity in experimental animal models of C. albicans
infection was shown by the IgG mAb, which selectively recognized
b1,3 glucan rather than by the IgM, which was promiscuous in its
binding to b1,3, b1,6 and also b1,4 glucan sequences; iii) the
protective IgG mAb but not the non-protective IgM mAb, bound

to components secreted by growing fungal cells; iv) the IgG mAb
caused a remarkable inhibition of C. albicans adherence to
epithelial cells and reduced hyphal growth in vitro; v) the IgG
and also the IgM were not opsonic in a macrophage opsonisation￾killing assay, but the IgG was able to bind to at least two glucan￾linked cell wall proteins, the Als3 and Hyr1, which play a role in
adherence, tissue-invasion and growth of C. albicans [54,55]. The
last two findings suggest that the protective efficacy may be at least
in part mediated by host-independent properties.
A number of experimental approaches were used to gain
insights into the cell wall ligand(s) recognized by the two mAb.
These consistently indicated that the protective IgG mAb had a
quite selective specificity for b1,3- linked glucose sequences. Its
binding to fungal b-glucan was inhibited by b1,3- but not by b1,6-
linked oligosaccharides in competition ELISA experiments.
Microarray analyses showed exclusive IgG mAb binding to
b1,3-linked glucose sequences with DP 4 and greater. In contrast,
the IgM mAb bound both to b1,3- (although less strongly than the
IgG mAb) as well as to b1,6-linked glucose sequences with DP 2
and greater. As shown by microarray analyses it also recognized
saccharides with b1,4 glucan sequences, which are ordinarily
absent in fungi but present in higher plants and lichens.
Interestingly, a linear b1,3-b1,4-linked glucan is uniquely present
in the cell wall of Aspergillus fumigatus [56], a fungus which is bound
by both mAbs, as found by immunofluorescence staining, and
whose growth is highly susceptible to the anti-b-glucan antibodies
generated by the immunization with the Lam-CRM vaccine [20].
The disposition of b1,3 glucan on C. albicans cell surface, an
essential prerequisite for interaction with the protective anti-b￾glucan mAb, is a matter of controversy. There are suggestions that
b1,3 glucan is hidden inside the cell wall by a layer of
mannoprotein constituents and that it is lacking or negligibly
expressed on the fungal surface, particularly in hyphal cells [57–
60]. This sort of b-glucan stealth has been recently interpreted as a
host-deceiving mechanism, as it would prevent the binding of
fungal cells by Dectin-1 - a b1,3 glucan specific receptor present
on a variety of cells of the innate immune system - thus inhibiting
the triggering of critical signals for coupling innate to adaptive
antifungal immunity [57,59–63]. However, other authors have
reported surface expression of this polysaccharide in both yeasts
Figure 6. Antifungal properties of the anti-b-glucan mAbs. Panel A: C. albicans growth-inhibitory activity by the mAbs. C. albicans cells were
cultured at 37uC in the presence or in the absence of the indicated mAb doses and, after 4 or 18 hours of incubation, fungal growth was estimated by
a standard CFU counts. Percent growth inhibition values are from three independent experiments and were calculated by comparison to fungal
cultures with equal doses of heat-inactivated mAbs or with an irrelevant mAb. Statistically significant differences between growth inhibitory activities
by the IgG and the IgM mAb are marked by asterisks. Panel B: ability by the mAbs to inhibit adherence of Candida to human epithelial cells.
Monolayers of Hep-2 cells were put into contact with fungal cells which have been pre-treated with the IgG, the IgM or with an irrelevant mAb as
indicated. After a 1 h contact at 37uC, co-cultures were gently washed to eliminate non adherent fungi. Adherent fungal cells were recovered from
the wells and enumerated by a standard CFU counts. Data in the graph are from three independent experiments, each performed in triplicate.

and hyphae [20,64]. This apparent discrepancy could be
reconciled by very recent reports that b1,3 glucan may be variably
expressed by fungal cells depending on their growth conditions
and/or morphology [65,66]. Moreover, different reagents, with
likely different fine specificity, were used by the various Authors to
detect b1,3 glucan at cell surface. The IF and EM data shown here
with the use of a mAb with restricted specificity for b1,3 glucan
leave little doubt that some b1,3 glucan or components carrying
this polysaccharide are expressed on cell surface, albeit not in all
cells of the culture ( especially for yeast cells) and not uniformly in
all labelled cells (especially for hyphal cells). This would be
expected in a asynchronous culture if b1,3 glucan is consistently
exposed only at certain stages of growth. Interpretation of all these
data must take also into account the presence of b1,3 and b1,6
glucan moieties in the mannoprotein modules of the cell wall,
which are both intrinsic cell wall constituents and secretory
molecules somewhat spanning the cell wall and transiently
expressed on cell surface [67]. In this scenario, the antibody￾accessible b-1,3 glucan could be mostly represented by the glucan
bound to the proteins of the outer cell wall, which is likely to
undergo even marked variations during growth and morphologic
changes, rather than the more invariant b-glucan of the inner cell
wall skeleton.
In this paper, we show that there is at least as much IgM- as IgG
mAb-reactive b-glucan in C. albicans cell wall, as seen by ELISA
using C. albicans b-glucan (GG-Zym; see above) and EM of gold￾immunolabelled sections of both yeast and hyphal cells of the
fungus. Remarkably, however, the material secreted by growing
fungal cells was much more reactive with the IgG than with the
IgM mAb (in ELISA) or substantially non reactive with the IgM
antibody (in Western blot). This suggests that the secreted material
is enriched with b1,3 glucan sequences as compared with b-glucan
‘‘stably’’ located in the cell wall.
Among the secretory components recognized by the protective
IgG mAb, two of them, Als3 and Hyr1, could be among the
targets of the protective action of this mAb. Both these proteins
belong to a major category of cell wall components, the GPI￾anchored proteins, which are covalently linked to b-glucan and
include structural constituents, enzymes, adhesins and other
components playing a crucial role in cell wall organization, stress
response and virulence of the fungus [50,68]. Both Als3 and Hyr1
are known to be actively secreted by C. albicans [50,68]: their
strong binding by the IgG mAb would also suggest that they are
secreted with attached b-glucan, in particular b1,3 glucan,
moieties.
Relatively little is known about the functional properties of Hyr1
protein. It is activated during hyphal transition [69] and upon
exposure to macrophages or neutrophils [70,71] and its expression
has been shown to be under control of well-established hyphal
regulatory pathways of this fungus [72,73]. Overall, this protein is
assumed to play a role in yeast to mycelial conversion of C. albicans.
Relevant to the data shown in this study is a very recent report that
members of the IFF protein family, to which Hyr1 belongs, play a
role in fungus adherence [74].
There is much more information on the structure and biological
properties of Als3, and this is clearly relevant to the interpretation
of the inhibitory and protective potential of our anti-b1,3-glucan
IgG mAb. Als3 is encoded by the corresponding gene of the ALS
gene family which code for structurally-related, high Mr cell
surface and secreted glycoproteins [75]. Their primary, though not
exclusive, biological role is to mediate adherence of fungal cells,
possibly with different members of the family being differentially
involved in the adherence to different host cells and tissues [75]. As
pointed out by results of gene overexpression, knock-out mutant
studies in C. albicans and heterologous expression in S. cerevisiae,
Als3 is the member of the family with the largest impact on
adherence to both epithelial and endothelial cells, [76–78].
Together with other adhesins, Als3 is also involved in biofilm
formation [79]. The Als3 protein has also been shown to mediate
iron acquisition from ferritin by the hyphae of C. albicans [80],
being iron acquisition necessary for hyphal growth.
Recombinant Als3 and its N-terminus moiety have been quite
extensively investigated as candidate vaccines against C. albicans
and other Candida species, and shown to be protective both against
systemic and mucosal candidiasis [37]. Vaccine efficacy has been
postulated to be entirely dependent on cell-mediated immunity,
with little or no role for antibodies [37]. In its recombinant format,
the Als3 protein lacks b1,3 glucan, thus any role of anti-b1,3-
glucan antibodies in the above context is excluded. Nonetheless,
Als3 is an adhesin/invasin with multiple roles in virulence and this
would suggest that anti-Als3 antibodies directed against the native
Als3 could exert protection by blockade of one or more virulence￾associated epitopes of the protein. Of interest in this context is that
another protective antibody (mAb C7), which is directly
candidacidal, has been reported to bind to the N-terminus region
of Als 3 [81].
Overall, both Hyr1 and, more evidently, Als3 play important
roles in C. albicans virulence properties such as hyphal growth and
adherence which are both inhibited by our protective IgG mAb
which recognizes the two proteins. In contrast, neither hyphal
growth nor adherence are affected by the non protective IgM mAb
which does not recognize the two proteins. Nonetheless, it remains
possible that the protective antibody interacts with, and inhibits
the function of other unidentified b1,3 glucan constituents exerting
a role in fungal virulence or other critical biological properties in
vivo.
It is rather surprising that neither the Hyr1 nor the Als3 proteins
are bound by the promiscuous IgM mAb which recognizes
different b-linked saccharide molecules, including b1,3 glucose
sequences. However, it should be considered that mAb epitope
specificity data shown in this study have been obtained using
polysaccharides, free oligosaccharides and lipid-linked oligosac￾charide probes. It is possible that the b-glucan antigen on native
and secreted proteins is presented in a form that can be bound by
the IgG but not by the IgM. In principle, the low specific activity
of the IgM mAb for the b1,3 glucan, as assessed with laminarin or
oligosaccharides used in ELISA and microarrays, could be even
lower for the b1,3 glucan sequences of the secreted native proteins.
Extensive mannosylation of the two proteins could also exert steric
hindrance toward the access of the large IgM to the b-glucan
epitope.
As outlined above, the two mAbs used throughout this study
have different isotypes but identical amino acid sequence of both
light and heavy chain CDRs. A few examples of mAbs with the
same CDR but different isotypes were reported to have different
binding specificities and avidities toward polysaccharides, because
of the influence exerted on binding by structural elements of the
antibody distant from the antigen-binding site [41,42,44,82].
These factors may also influence the biological properties of the
antibody, including its protective ability against infections [38,40].
It is well known that antibody isotype influences the avidity
whereby the antibody binds its cognate antigen, as well as a
number of Fc-dependent, host effector functions, such as, for
instance, complement activation and interaction with activating or
inhibitory receptors on various immune cells. However, other
mechanisms translating fine differences in antigen binding of
antibodies sharing the same CDR into profound differences in
their biological properties have not been established. We show
Anti-b-Glucan mAbs
PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 11 April 2009 | Volume 4 | Issue 4 | e5392

here for the first time that the isotype contributes to the selectivity
and intensity of binding to particular, structurally defined, b￾glucan sequences as well as to defined cell wall molecules of the
fungus. As an important consequence, we show here that
antibodies with different isotypes may differ in their ability to
inhibit critical virulence properties of a fungal pathogen such as
hyphal growth and adherence in vitro.
It remains to be determined whether the isotype-dependent
protective properties of the IgG mAb are also independent of Fc￾mediated antibody effector mechanisms in vivo. Opsonisation is one
of the main mechanisms whereby the host can eliminate or control
Candida in vivo [40]. Our anti-b-glucan IgG mAb did not show
opsonic potential in the macrophage model system tested. The
lack of opsonisation appears to be in keeping with the
discontinuous nature of b-glucan expression at the fungal cell
surface and may be relevant also to the interactions with other
effector systems (e.g. those mediated by neutrophils) not addressed
here. Nonetheless, other Fc-dependent and independent biological
activities of this antibody could play a role in vivo, and these need
to be evaluated in future studies. For instance, the protective mAb,
through its binding to the secreted b1,3-glucan and Als3 could
inhibit biofilm formation to which both this polysaccharide and
the ALS3 protein seem to play a role [79,83], and thus interfere
with this process which has a key role in fungal invasion.
Conceivably, this antibody may also modulate, to the host’s
advantage, the interactions of fungal cells with Dectin-1 and other
critical receptors of innate immunity [84] or also abrogate the
inhibitory capacity expressed by some b-glucans on maturation of
host dendritic cells, which are critically involved in the generation
of protective anti-fungal immunity [85,86].
Taken together, the data presented in this study identify
blockade of adherence and interference with hyphal growth as
possible mechanisms of protection by anti-b-1,3-glucan antibodies.
This highlights the exciting possibility that antibodies which
neutralize virulence factors of the fungus, thus not relying entirely
upon host factors for their therapeutic activity, would be of value
in the fight against pathogenic fungi in immuno-compromized
subjects. Nonetheless, further studies are needed to address in
detail the mechanisms of antibody protection in vivo.
Materials and Methods
MAb generation and characterization
2G8 and 1E12 hybridomas were generated from spleen cells of
Balb/c mice (Harlan Nossan, Indianapolis, Indiana) previously
immunized with a soluble, C. albicans b-glucan preparation (GG￾Zym, [35] conjugated to the recombinant, genetically inactivated
diphteria toxin CRM197, as already described [20]. Spleen cells
were fused with myeloma cells of the murine line X63-Ag8 653
using standard in-house protocols [87]. Hybridomas were selected
by assaying the secreted mAbs by ELISA with a panel of b-glucan
molecules (laminarin, pustulan, soluble C. albicans b-glucan );
isotype (IgG2b and IgM for 2G8 or 1E12, respectively) was
determined by reactivity with specific, alkaline-phosphatase￾conjugated anti-mouse immunoglobulin antibodies. Hybridoma
cells were routinely cultured in protein-free CD Hybridoma
medium (Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA), supplemented with
100 U penicillin/ml, 100 mg streptomycin/ml, 1 mM sodium
pyruvate, and 2 mM L-glutamine (Hyclone, Logan, Utah). MAbs
were precipitated from culture supernatants by ammonium sulfate
[87], dyalized against PBS and concentrated by ultrafiltration
through a 100 kDa cut-off membrane (Millipore, Bedford, USA)
and measured by a commercial protein assay (BioRad, Richmond,
USA) following the manufacturer’s instructions. The irrelevant,
negative control mAb (IgG2b immunoglobulins directed against
unconjugated CRM197 protein) was obtained from the respective
hybridoma following an identical procedure. In some growth
inhibition assays, heat-inactivated (5 min, 100uC), anti-b-glucan
mAbs were also used as the negative controls.
For sequencing VH and VL variable regions of the mAbs,
mRNA was isolated from approximately 16107 hybridoma cells,
using QuickPrep Micro mRNA Purification Kit (# 27-9255-01,
Amersham Pharmacia Biotec, HP7 9NA Buckinghamshire, UK),
according to the manufacturer’s instructions and reverse-tran￾scribed (1 mg from each hybridoma cell line) by a Smart PCR
Synthesis kit (# K1052-1, Clontech, USA). cDNA quality was
analysed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using specific
primers to amplify GAPDH as housekeeping gene. L chains were
amplified by PCR with the VL1 fw 59-GATATTGTGATGACC￾CAGTCTCCA-39 and VL2 Rev 59-TGGATACAGTTGGTG￾CAGC-39 primer, whereas H chains were amplified with VH1
BACK 59-AGGTSMARCTGCAGSAGTCWGG-39 and VH2 59-
GGCCAGTGGATAGAC-39. The amplified VH and VL chain
DNA samples were separated on a 2% agarose gel, purified and
cloned into pCR-bluntII-TOPO (Invitrogen, CA 92008 USA).
The Escherichia coli TOP 10 strain was used for transformation
experiments with recombinant plasmids, according to Zero Blunt
TOPO PCR Cloning Kit methods (# K 2800-20, Invitrogen).
Transformant clones were analysed by PCR on colony, and
amplified fragments were digested with HaeIII restriction
endonuclease. All constructs were sequenced by Biofab Research
srl, (Rome, Italy), and VH and VL CDRs of the hybridoma cell
lines were analysed with the Imgt database (http://imgt.cines.fr/).
All procedures described above were performed twice and
identical VH and VL gene sequences were obtained. Gene
sequences were submitted the GenBank and received the accession
number of the nucleotide sequence : FJ790243 (bankit1189566).
Microorganisms
C. albicans strains BP and SA-40 (type collection of the Istituto
Superiore di Sanita`) were used in the models of disseminated and
vaginal Candida infections, respectively. For experimental infec￾tions, cells from stock cultures in Sabouraud-dextrose agar (Difco￾BBL, Franklin Lakes, New York) were grown in Winge medium
(strain BP, [35]) or in YEPD medium (1% yeast extract, 2%
peptone, 2% glucose, all w/v, strain SA-40, [29]) at 28uC for 24 h,
then harvested by centrifugation, washed, counted in a hemocy￾tometer, and resuspended to the desired concentration in
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Yeast cells for in vitro experi￾ments were prepared as described above using the strain BP.
Fungal hyphae were obtained by culturing yeast cells at 37uC in
Lee’s medium or in RPMI 1640 (Euroclone Ltd.), supplemented
with 1 mM glutamine and 2% FCS (EuroClone), as previously
described [88]. Under these conditions, initial yeast cells
developed short and elongated germ-tubes within 2–6 h, respec￾tively, and hyphal filaments at 18 h. In some experiments, parallel,
yeast-form cultures were grown under the same conditions at
28uC. A. fumigatus 495 and C. neoformans ATCCL, from the type
collection above, were routinely maintained on Sabouraud￾dextrose agar slants. A. fumigatus hyphae were grown from conidial
suspensions as described in [20]. C. neoformans yeast cells were
grown for 18 h in Sabouraud-dextrose broth under slight
agitation, washed and resuspended in PBS.
Immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy
For immunofluorescence staining, live yeast or hyphal cells of C.
albicans or C. neoformans cells, were allowed to adhere on
immunofluorescence microscope slides, extensively washed with
Anti-b-Glucan mAbs
PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 12 April 2009 | Volume 4 | Issue 4 | e5392

PBS containing 0.1% Tween 80 and blocked (1 h, 37uC) with 3%
bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS. Spots were reacted (2 h,
37uC) with various dilutions of the mAbs in PBS-3% BSA, washed,
and treated with fluorescein isothiocyanate- (FITC)-conjugated￾anti mouse IgG or IgM antibodies (Sigma-Aldrich, 1 h, 37uC).
After extensive washings, the slides were mounted in glycerol,
pH 9.6, and examined under a Leitz Diaplan fluorescence
microscope. A. fumigatus hyphae were prepared by culturing
conidia (104 in RPMI 1640-FCS) in microscope chamber slides
(NUNC, Roskilde, Denmark). After incubation for 18 h at 37uC,
the culture medium was removed, the slides were washed, blocked,
reacted with the mAbs and observed as described above. Parallel
staining with negative control mAbs or with the secondary
antibodies alone was carried out in all the experiments. Ultrathin
cryosections of C. albicans yeast and hyphal cells were prepared
following the method by K.T. Tokuyasu [89]. The cells were fixed
with 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde plus 0.5% (v/v) glutaraldehyde
and embedded in 2% (w/v) agarose low melting point (LMP).
Agarose blocks were infused with 2.3 M sucrose and frozen in
liquid N2. Ultrathin cryosections obtained by Leica Ultracut UCT
device (Leica Microsystem, Wien, Austria), were incubated with
the mAbs, then revealed with specific goat anti-mouse 10-nm gold
conjugates (1:10 diluted, Sigma-Aldrich, Milan, Italy). Samples
were examined with a Philips 208 transmission electron micro￾scope (FEI Company, Eindhoven, The Netherlands). Negative
controls were performed by reacting samples with an irrelevant
murine IgG or with the immunoconjugates alone.
A quantitative evaluation of the labeling intensity was carried
out on micrographs of cryosectioned hyphal and yeast forms, after
labeling with IgG or IgM antibodies. Six images for each sample
were chosen, paying particular attention to select only those in
which the section crossed the central plane of the cell. In this way,
the two different fungal forms could be well identified and the
thickness of the cell wall was easily measurable. The gold particles
present on the section plane of the cell wall were counted manually
and related to the respectice surface (mm2
).
Protection assays
Protection against experimental, systemic candidiasis was
assessed in female, 4 week-old CD2F1 mice (Harlan-Nossan,
Milano, Italy). Animals were administered a single i.p. dose of
either mAb (100 to 150 mg/0.5 ml, as specified in single
experiments) and, 2 h later, received a systemic challenge with
C. albicans (56105 or 106 cells/0.2 ml, i.v.). Control animals were
treated with the same doses of an irrelevant, anti-CRM IgG2b
mAb. Extent of kidney invasion was evaluated 2 d after the
challenge by enumeration of fungal CFU in the left kidney [20].
When protection endpoint was mortality, mice were followed up
for 60 d to assess median survival time and ratio of dead/total
challenged mice.
Vaginal candidiasis was induced in oophorectomized Wistar
rats (Charles River Breeding Laboratories, Calco, Italy) main￾tained under pseudoestrus by the s.c. administration of estradiol
benzoate (Amsa Farmaceutici srl, Rome, Italy), essentially as
described previously [29]. Six days after the first estradiol dose, the
animals were inoculated intravaginally with 107 yeast cells in
0.1 ml of saline and then treated by the intravaginal route at 1, 24
and 48 hours post-infection with 40 mg/200 ml of the anti-b￾glucan mAbs, or with the same dose of an irrelevant mAb or with
200 ml of PBS. Protection was evaluated through the estimation of
fungal CFU in vagina until day 21–28 after infection, as described
in previous reports [29]. All animal studies were approved by the
Istituto Superiore di Sanita` intramural Institutional Review
Committee.
Glucan antigens and other reagents
Soluble C. albicans b-glucan (GG-Zym), a mixture of b1, 3 and
b1, 6 glucan, was obtained by limited b1, 3 glucanase (Zymoliase
100T, Seikagaku Corporation) digestion of particulate glucan
ghosts of C. albicans, as previously described [47]. Laminarin, a
linear b1,3-linked glucan backbone with occasional b1,6-linked
branching, was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St Louis, Missouri)
and pustulan, a b1,6–linked, linear glucan, was obtained from
Calbiochem (La Jolla, California). The b1,3-linked oligosaccha￾rides used in competition ELISA (laminaritriose to laminarihep￾taose) were from Seikagaku, Tokyo, Japan, whereas b1, 6-linked
oligosaccharides were obtained by limited digestion of pustulan
with endo-b1,6-glucanase (Prozyme, San Leandro, California),
followed by size separation by chromatography on a Bio-Gel P2
extra-fine resin (BioRad), as reported in [47]. A b-glucan
preparation from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, linear b1,3,1,4 glucan
from barley and dextran, an a1,6-linked polysaccharide, all from
Sigma-Aldrich, were also used. A mannoprotein preparation,
comprising major immunodominat fungal antigens, was extracted
and purified from C. albicans as previously described [90].
ELISA and competition ELISA
Polystyrene microtiter plates (MaxiSorp; NUNC) coated with
the various b-glucan antigens and blocked with 3% bovine serum
albumin (Fraction V, Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS were reacted with
two-fold dilutions of the mAbs followed by alkaline phosphatase￾conjugated, secondary antibody reagents (anti-mouse IgG or IgM
antibodies, Sigma-Aldrich), as described in previous reports [35].
Plates were then developed with p-nitrophenyl phosphate
disodium (Sigma-Aldrich) as the enzyme substrate and read for
absorbance at 405 nm. Readings from negative controls (wells
non-reacted with the mAbs or reacted with irrelevant mAbs) were
subtracted from all absorbance values.
For ELISA competition assays, the mAbs were pre-reacted at
4uC with different competitor b-glucan molecules, at various
concentrations. The mAb-competitor mixtures were then added to
wells with plastic-adsorbed Candida b-glucan (GG-Zym) and
residual mAb binding to this latter was measured as described
above. Percentage of inhibition values were calculated by
comparing O.D. measurements from the wells with the different
competitor ligands with those from wells reacted with the mAbs in
the absence of competitors [87].
Oligosaccharide probes and microarray analyses
A total of 53 gluco-oligosaccharides with differing linkages and
chain lengths were arrayed as lipid-linked probes prepared from
reducing oligosaccharides by oxime ligation with an aminooxy
(AO) functionalized phospholipid [91]. The oligosaccharides
investigated were as follows: i) a1,4-linked oligosaccharides, DP
2 to 7 (Sigma-Aldrich) and fragments, DP 8 to 13, separated by gel
filtration chromatography [62] from a maltodextrins acid
hydrolysate (V-labs purchased via Dextra); ii) a1,6-linked oligo￾saccharide fragments, DP 2 to 13, were generated from dextran
(Amersham-Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) by acid hydrolysis
followed by gel filtration chromatography; iii) b1,3-linked
oligosaccharides, DP 2 to 4 from Dextra (Reading, UK), DP 5
to 6 from Megazyme (Wicklow, Ireland), DP 7 from Seikagaku
America (Falmouth, MA) and fragments, DP 8 to 13, separated by
gel filtration chromatography from a curdlan acid hydrolysate
(Megazyme (Wicklow, Ireland); iv) b1,4-linked oligosaccharides,
DP 2 (Sigma-Aldrich) and fragments, DP 3 to 6, separated by gel
filtration chromatography from a cellooligosaccharide mixture (V￾labs purchased via Dextra); v) b1,6-linked oligosaccharides
fragments, DP 2 to 13, were generated from pustulan (Calbio￾Anti-b-Glucan mAbs
PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 13 April 2009 | Volume 4 | Issue 4 | e5392

chem) by acetolysis [62] followed by gel filtration chromatography.
Molecular masses of the main components of oligosaccharide
fractions from gel filtration were corroborated by MALDI-MS
[62].
NGLs were arrayed robotically, and the microarray analyses
with anti-glucan antibodies were performed essentially as de￾scribed [62]. In brief, the microarray slides were overlaid with the
IgG or the IgM diluted in casein (Pierce, Illinois, US) containing
1% (w/v) BSA (Sigma-Aldrich) and 10 mM CaCl2, to give a final
concentration of 0.1 and 0.5 mg/ml, respectively. Binding of mAb
2G8 was detected with biotinylated anti-mouse-IgG, 1:200, and of
mAb 1E12 with biotinylated anti-mouse immunoglobulins,
1:1000, (both from Sigma-Aldrich) followed by Alexa Fluor-647-
labelled streptavidin (Molecular Probes) at 1 mg/ml. Imaging was
as described [62] and data analysis was performed with a
dedicated software (Mark P. Stoll of the Glycosciences Laboratory,
unpublished).
Preparation and analysis of C. albicans cell wall proteins
and secretory material
Isolated, clean hyphal cell walls were prepared by mechanical
breakage of cells with 0.45-mm glass beads followed by extensive
washes in cold water, as previously described [92]. Observations
under an electron microscope confirmed the purity of the cell
walls. Glucan-associated proteins (GAPs) were obtained by
extracting cell walls with sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-DTT￾EDTA, followed by b1,3 endoglucanase (Zymoliase 100T,
Seikagaku) digestion according to Kapteyn et al [49]. Secreted
fungal proteins were separated and concentrated from superna￾tants of 24-h hyphal cultures by extensive ultrafiltration/dialysis
through a low-adsorbance ultrafiltration membrane (molecular
cut-off 10 kDa, Millipore, Bedford, MA), as described elsewhere
[92]. The IgG mAb-reactive fraction of fungal secretion was
purified by affinity binding to a column prepared by covalently
coupling the IgG mAb to protein A-Sepharose CL4B (Pharmacia)
with dimethylpimelimidate (Sigma). The bound material was
eluted with 100 mM triethylamine, pH 11.5, neutralized with 2 M
Tris and, after dialysis against PBS and concentration by
ultrafiltration, was kept at 220uC. Comparative assessment of
overall reactivity of secretory material with the mAbs was made by
ELISA, as described above, by using different dilutions of fungal
secretions as plastic-bound antigens.
Sodium dodecyl-sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
(SDS-PAGE) separation of GAPs and secretory proteins was
performed in 5 to 15% polyacrylamide slab gels, as reported
elsewhere [93]. After electrophoresis, proteins were either
Coomassie-stained or electrophoretically transferred onto nitro￾cellulose (0.2-mm pore size), immunostained with the mAbs and
revealed with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG or
IgM antibodies (Sigma-Aldrich), followed by 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-
indolyl-phosphate and 4-nitroblue tetrazolium chloride solution as
the enzyme substrate [93]. In some experiments, fungal secretions
were subjected to periodate oxidation (30 min in 0.2 M NaIO4,
Sigma-Aldrich), followed by extensive dialysis by gel filtration and
SDS-PAGE and western blot analysis. Mannosylation of fungal
secretion was assessed by staining blots with Concanavalin A￾digoxigenin and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-digoxigenin
antibody (Boehringer-Mannheim)
Identification of mAb-reactive fungal proteins
Protein bands were manually excised from gel and proteolysis
was achieved using the In-gel Digest96 KitTM (Millipore, Bedford,
MA, USA) with 15 ml of the trypsin provided by the kit
manufacturer (about 11 mg/ml in 25 mM ammonium bicarbon￾ate) at 37uC for 3 h. After digestion, in gel tryptic peptides re￾suspension was performed by incubation of each gel piece in
130 ml of a 0.2% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) aqueous solution for
30 min at room temperature. Finally tryptic peptides were eluted
from the microcolumns to a MALDI target plate with 1.3 ml of a
solution of a-cyano-4-hydroxy-trans-cinnamic acid matrix (2 mg/
ml) in 70% acetonitrile containing 0.1% TFA. MALDI-TOF
analyses were performed in a Voyager-DETM STR instrument
(Applied Biosystem, Framingham, MA, USA) equipped with a
337 nm nitrogen laser and operating in reflector mode. Mass data
were obtained by accumulating several spectra from laser shots
with an accelerating voltage of 20,000 V. All mass spectra were
externally calibrated using a standard peptide mixture containing
des-Arg-Bradykinin (904.4681), angiotensin I (1296.6853), 1–17
(2093.0867) and 18–39 (2465.1989) adrenocorticotropic hormon
fragments. Two tryptic autolytic peptides were also used for the
internal calibration (m/z 842.5100 and 2807.3145).
A monoisotopic mass list from each protein spot was obtained
from the MALDI-TOF data after exclusion of contaminant mass
values, corresponding to those expected from porcine trypsin and
human keratins, automatically achieved by the PeakErazor
program (http://www.protein.sdu.dk/gpmaw/Help/PeakEra￾zor/peakerazor.html). These peptide mass fingerprints were used
to search for protein candidates in fungi protein database at the
NCBI using the MASCOT software program (www.ma￾trixscience.com) according to these parameters: one missed
cleavage permission and 50 ppm measurement tolerance. Oxida￾tion at methionine (variable modification) residues was also
considered and positive identifications were accepted when at
least five matching peptides masses were identified.
MAb functional assays
Opsonic activity and inhibition of fungal adhesion by the mAbs
were evaluated using the J774 murine macrophage (MW) and the
Hep-2 human epithelial cell lines, respectively. Cells were
routinely maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (HyClone) contain￾ing 10% fetal calf serum, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 U/ml
streptomycin, and 2 mM glutamine at 37uC and 5% CO2. For
experimental purposes, cells were prepared for subculture with
trypsin-EDTA (Gibco, BRL), washed, resuspended in medium as
above at the desired cell concentration, transferred in 96-well
microtiter plates and used 24 h later.
In macrophage (MW) killing assays for assessment of opsonic
activity, J774 cells (26104
/100 ml/well) were infected with C.
albicans cells (26104
, 46103 or 26103
/100 ml/well) in the presence
or absence of the mAbs (10 mg/ml) or with the same dose of an
irrelevant mAb. A highly opsonic anti-Candida mannoprotein and
an irrelevant murine serum (both used at 10 ml/well) were also
included in the experiments. Control cultures consisted of Candida
cells with or without the various mAbs or sera, in the absence of
MW. Each condition was assayed in triplicate. After a 3 h contact,
MW were lysed by adding 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100 (Sigma￾Aldrich) and live fungal cells were enumerated by a conventional
CFU count. Percentage of killing was calculated by comparison of
CFU values macrophage-fungal cell co-cultures with those from
parallel cultures without macrophages.
In adhesion assays, Hep-2 cells monolayers (1.56105 cells/well)
were washed with PBS and incubated 2 h at 37uC in PBS with
Candidacells (86104
/well), with or without the anti-b-glucan or
control mAbs (5 to 25 mg/well), in triplicate. Non adherent fungal
cells were then removed with repeated, gentle washings with PBS.
Adherent fungi were recovered from cell monolayers with PBS
containing 0.2% Triton X-100 and enumerated by CFU counts.
Percentage of inhibition of fungal adhesion was calculated by
Anti-b-Glucan mAbs
PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 14 April 2009 | Volume 4 | Issue 4 | e5392

comparing the number of adherent fungi in wells containing the
anti-b-glucan mAbs with that in wells containing equal concen￾trations of irrelevant mAbs.
Growth inhibition activity was measured at 4 or 18 h by CFU
assays in C. albicans cultures (1.56103
/ml in 200 ml of RPMI-FCS)
grown in the presence of the IgG, the IgM mAb or the control
mAbs (irrelevant IgG2b mAb or heat-inactivated anti-b.glucan
mAbs), as reported elsewhere [20].
Statistical analysis
Data were analyzed by the GraphPad Prism 4 software
(GraphPad Inc.). ELISA data were assessed for statistical
significance by curve fit analysis. Differences in median survival
time and in survival rates in C. albicans–challenged mice were
analyzed by nonparametric two-tailed Mann-Whitney U test or
Fisher’s exact test, respectively. Differences in survival curves were
assessed by the log-rank test. Data from CFU counts, in both in
vitro and in vivo experiments, were analyzed by two-tailed
Student’s t test. Multiple comparisons were made by analysis of
variance (one-way ANOVA) followed by Newman-Keuls post-test.
