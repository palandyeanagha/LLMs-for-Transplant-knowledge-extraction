Abstract
Sorafenib is a molecular-targeted therapy used in palliative treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)
in Child-Pugh A patients. We describe the case of a patient who presented with a large HCC in the left liver
associated with portal vein thrombosis (PVT). After 9 months of sorafenib treatment, reassessment showed that the
tumors had decreased in size with recanalization of the portal vein. A lateral left hepatectomy was performed and
pathology showed complete necrosis of the tumor. Sorafenib can downstage HCC in patients with cirrhosis
allowing further surgical resection.
Keywords: Hepatocellular carcinoma, Sorafenib, Liver resection
Background
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common
type of primary liver tumor and is the fifth most com￾mon malignancy worldwide [1]. Variables related to early
HCC status (single tumor ≤5 cm or three nodules ≤3
cm), the so-called Milan criteria, define good prognosis
and are accessible to curative therapies, such as surgical
resection, liver transplantation and percutaneous abla￾tion [2,3]. Surgical resection is still considered the most
effective treatment for HCC. However, only 30% of all
patients are diagnosed at early stage and therefore able
to benefit from curative therapies [2]. These patients
achieve 5-year survival rates of 50% to 75% [3].
Most patients are diagnosed at advanced stage. The
main prognostic factors are related to tumor status
defined by the number and size of nodules, presence or
absence of vascular invasion, presence or absence of
extrahepatic spread, liver function (Child-Pugh class,
serum bilirubin and albumin levels, and portal hyperten￾sion), and general health status defined by the Eastern
Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) classification.
Untreated patients with advanced-stage disease, that is
ECOG performance status grade 1 or grade 2, and/or
vascular invasion or extrahepatic spread, have a median
survival of 6 to 7 months [4].
Sorafenib (BAY 43–9006, Nexavar; Bayer, Leverkusen,
Germany), a multi-target tyrosine kinase inhibitor used
in palliative treatment of advanced HCC, can improve
the survival of patients [5]. Nevertheless, Llovet et al. [5]
demonstrated in a multicenter, phase III, double-blind,
placebo-controlled trial that median time to symptom￾atic progression did not improve, and only 2% of pa￾tients achieved partial radiological response and none
complete response. We report the case of a patient with
locally advanced HCC associated with portal vein
thrombosis (PVT). The patient achieved complete re￾gression of HCC using sorafenib treatment allowing fur￾ther curative surgical resection.
Case presentation
A 68-year-old man presented to Rouen University
Hospital, Rouen, France, with asthenia, diffuse abdom￾inal pain and cirrhosis. Hepatitis B and C virus serologic
status were negative and iron status was normal.
Cirrhosis was related to alcohol abuse. Abdominal ultra￾sound showed hepatomegaly and a liver tumor measur￾ing 14 cm located in the left lobe. An abdominal
computerized tomography (CT) scan confirmed a lesion

in the left liver measuring 15.7 cm and with left
intrahepatic portal branch thrombosis (Figure 1). Typical
radiological features, including hypervascular and portal
phase washout, together with an increase in alpha￾fetoprotein (AFP) serum levels at 986 ng/mL (normal
<20 ng/mL), confirmed diagnosis of HCC without
performing liver biopsy [2]. The size of the lesion
associated with a portal thrombus prohibited curative
surgical treatment [3]. Considering the patient’s general
state of health and the Child-Pugh class (A6), palliative
treatment with sorafenib (800 mg/day) was initiated in
January 2011.
After 3 months of treatment, evaluation showed
normalization of AFP levels (from 986 ng/mL to 7 ng/
mL and decrease in hepatic lesion size (from 15.7 cm to
7 cm). Side effects included grade 2 to 3 hand-foot
syndrome and diarrhea. Due to this objective radio￾logical response, sorafenib treatment was continued with
dose adjustment to 600 mg/day.
After 9 months of treatment, AFP levels decreased to
5.3 ng/mL, and CT scan showed 60% regression of the
hepatic lesion measuring 6 cm long with recanalization
of the left portal branch (Figure 2).
One month after stopping sorafenib, surgical treatment
was proposed and a left liver lobectomy was performed
without vascular clamping. There were no postsurgical
complications and the patient was discharged from hospital
5 days after surgery.
Gross pathological examination showed multiple white
nodules and the whole lesion measured 6 cm × 4 cm ×
5 cm. The nodules were well circumscribed by fibrous
tissue. Microscopic examination revealed nodules with a
central necrotic core, surrounded by a hyalinized fibrotic
capsule. No residual tumor cell was observed. The sur￾rounding liver parenchyma was cirrhotic (METAVIR F4)
(Figures 3 and 4). The patient showed no recurrence of
HCC 14 months after liver resection.
Discussion
In this case, a patient with cirrhosis whose HCC was
initially unresectable received sorafenib with palliative
intent, allowing curative surgical resection. There was
no evidence of residual tumor cell at microscopic exam￾ination. To our knowledge, only one case of complete
pathological response induced by sorafenib treatment in

a patient with cirrhosis and HCC has been reported in
the literature [6].
Diagnostic criteria for HCC of a cirrhotic liver are
mainly biological and radiological. Previously, an algo￾rithm for investigation of liver nodules was proposed by
the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) Group [7].
Diagnosis depends on the size and radiological charac￾teristics of the nodule, associated with the rate of AFP
and, in some cases, biopsy. Subsequently, the strategy
for staging and treatment assignment for patients diag￾nosed with HCC was also proposed by the BCLC Group.
In a recent retrospective observational study, Torzilli et
al. [8] demonstrated that patients with advanced tumor
can benefit from surgical resection and suggested that
therapeutic guidelines should be updated.
HCC is a hypervascular tumor. Sorafenib is the only
multi-kinase inhibitor that blocks receptor tyrosine ki￾nases, such as vascular endothelial growth factor recep￾tor (VEGFR) or platelet-derived growth factor receptor
(PDGF-R), and also RAF serine/threonine kinases along
the RAF/MEK/ERK pathway [9]. Thus, sorafenib targets
both tumor cell proliferation and angiogenesis.
The efficacy of sorafenib in HCC has already been
demonstrated in two pivotal, multicenter, phase III,
placebo-controlled clinical trials. The SHARP Study
Group [5] accrued more than 600 patients with ad￾vanced HCC and cirrhosis (Child-Pugh A) not previ￾ously treated with any systemic therapy. This study
showed for the first time an advantage in terms of
median overall survival, which was 10.7 months for
sorafenib versus 7.9 months for placebo (P = 0.0006).
However, median time to symptomatic progression did
not differ significantly between the sorafenib and
placebo group (4.1 months and 4.9 months, respectively;
P = 0.77). In fact, only seven patients (2%) treated with
sorafenib were considered responders according to Re￾sponse Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST)
criteria. No complete response was recorded. Similarly,
the second phase III clinical study, carried out in the
Asia-Pacific region [10], recruited and randomized a
total of 226 patients in a 2:1 fashion. Median overall sur￾vival of patients in the sorafenib group was 6.2 months,
which was significantly better than the 4.1 months
achieved in the placebo group (P = 0.0155). In the ana￾lysis of best response, five of 150 patients in the

sorafenib group (3.3%) achieved partial response. There
was also no complete response.
Despite the demonstrated effectiveness of sorafenib,
there are few reported cases of resection in patients with
biological or radiological response. Irtan et al. [11]
reported two cases of downstaging of locally advanced
HCC after sorafenib treatment, allowing curative resec￾tion with complete pathological response. However, in
neither of these cases was the nontumoral liver cirrhotic.
Both patients developed chronic liver disease (METAVIR
F3) due to hemochromatosis and hepatitis B. The
Barbier et al. study [12] described two other cases of
surgery after sorafenib in two patients with chronic dis￾ease due to hepatitis C and chronic alcoholism, respect￾ively. Nevertheless, histopathological examination found
35% and 60% of tumor necrosis, along with residual
tumor cell, respectively. To our knowledge, only one
case report of complete pathological regression in severe
chronic liver disease (METAVIR F4) has been reported
in the literature [6]. No tumor cells were found and re￾canalization of the portal vein was complete.
Recanalization of the portal vein is another interesting
point. PVT is now considered as the main negative prog￾nostic factor in patients with HCC. HCC with malignant
PVT has poor prognosis, thus prohibiting curative ap￾proaches. In contrast, benign (fibrin clot) PVT is not a
contraindication to curative treatment. Patients with cirrho￾sis and HCC may develop either benign or malignant PVT.
In this context, critical evaluation of PVT by imaging tech￾niques and diagnostic criteria [13] is mandatory to differen￾tiate benign and malignant PVT [14]. In these settings, Li
et al. [15] recently suggested that vascular endothelial
growth factor may play a pivotal role in HCC angiogenesis,
and in PVT onset and evolution. Sorafenib could exert a
beneficial effect on PVT by inhibiting the VEGFR pathway.
Conclusions
Sorafenib opens a new window for treatment of locally
advanced HCC and highlights the importance of iden￾tifying factors that could be associated with good re￾sponse to this therapy. However, complete tumor
regression and necrosis increase difficulties in both tis￾sue analysis and search for predictive factors of good
response to the tumor (tumor phenotypes, biological
markers, and so on). Furthermore, close monitoring
and regular reassessment of patients is mandatory,
in order to promptly identify good responders to
sorafenib and subsequently propose surgical treatment
or other curative treatment. Moreover, although a
small number of hepatic resections following sorafenib
administration have been reported, no intraoperative
or postoperative complications related to preoperative
treatment have been observed [16].
Therefore, our case report suggests that neoadjuvant
sorafenib treatment could be a relay to surgery in se￾lected patients.
