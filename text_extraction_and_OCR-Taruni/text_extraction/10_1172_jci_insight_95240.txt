Introduction
Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a progressive disease of the pulmonary vasculature leading to 
elevated pulmonary pressure and right ventricular (RV) dysfunction with heart failure. Heart failure is the 
leading cause of death in PAH. Measures of RV function are better predictors of mortality and long￾term outcomes than pulmonary vascular resistance. The RV dysfunction can progress independent of, and 
despite achieving therapeutic reduction in pulmonary vascular resistance with pulmonary vasodilators (1). 
The interaction between RV function and the pulmonary circulation is not fully understood, but increased 
afterload appears insufficient to explain right heart failure (2). Yet, all approved PAH therapies target vaso￾dilation of the pulmonary vasculature to lower pressures.
In contrast to the lack of RV-targeted therapy for the heart failure of PAH, left ventricular–targeted 
(LV-targeted) therapy has been the foundation of left-sided or global heart failure for nearly 40 years 
(3). β-Adrenergic receptor (βAR) blockade, the cornerstone therapy in left heart failure, reverses car￾diac remodeling, and improves clinical outcomes, despite decades of concern regarding its propensity 
to exacerbate heart failure. Importantly, β-blockade reduces mortality by nearly 30% and remains the 
BACKGROUND. Right-sided heart failure is the leading cause of death in pulmonary arterial 
hypertension (PAH). Similar to left heart failure, sympathetic overactivation and β-adrenoreceptor 
(βAR) abnormalities are found in PAH. Based on successful therapy of left heart failure with 
β-blockade, the safety and benefits of the nonselective β-blocker/vasodilator carvedilol were 
evaluated in PAH.
METHODS. PAH Treatment with Carvedilol for Heart Failure (PAHTCH) is a single-center, double￾blind, randomized, controlled trial. Following 1-week run-in, 30 participants were randomized to 1 
of 3 arms for 24 weeks: placebo, low-fixed-dose, or dose-escalating carvedilol. Outcomes included 
clinical measures and mechanistic biomarkers.
RESULTS. Decreases in heart rate and blood pressure with carvedilol were well tolerated; heart 
rate correlated with carvedilol dose. Carvedilol-treated groups had no decrease in exercise capacity 
measured by 6-minute walk, but had lower heart rates at peak and after exercise, and faster heart 
rate recovery. Dose-escalating carvedilol was associated with reduction in right ventricular (RV) 
glycolytic rate and increase in βAR levels. There was no evidence of RV functional deterioration; 
rather, cardiac output was maintained.
CONCLUSIONS. Carvedilol is likely safe in PAH over 6 months of therapy and has clinical and 
mechanistic benefits associated with improved outcomes. The data provide support for longer and 
larger studies to establish guidelines for use of β-blockers in PAH.

most efficacious therapy in heart failure (4, 5). While β-blockade is an approved therapy in LV and 
global heart failure, its use in RV failure is not yet established (6). In fact, β-blockers are relatively con￾traindicated in PAH owing to concerns about possible negative effects on hemodynamics and exercise 
capacity in PAH patients. This is based on a small study of 10 patients with portopulmonary hyperten￾sion in whom withdrawal of the β-blocker propranolol was associated with improved exercise toler￾ance (7). Another case report described a single patient with portopulmonary hypertension treated with 
β-blocker for supraventricular tachycardia; treatment led to acute cardiovascular decompensation (8). 
In yet another study, patients with severe mitral stenosis and pulmonary hypertension (PH) undergoing 
valvuloplasty had increased pulmonary vascular resistance and decreased cardiac output when given 
the β-blocker atenolol (9).

CLINICAL MEDICINE
Despite these anecdotal reports of adverse consequences, there is good reason to consider β-blocker 
therapy for the RV failure of PAH. Similar to left heart failure, the sympathetic nervous system and renin￾angiotensin-aldosterone system are overly activated (10–13). Markers of sympathetic overactivation in 
PAH are comparable to those found in LV failure (14). Likewise, similar to left heart failure, βAR abnor￾malities are found in the RV of patients with PAH. Bristow et al. showed loss of β1
-ARs in the failing 
RV, depletion of tissue norepinephrine, and lower levels of adenylate cyclase activity at baseline and in 
response to stimulation, which were identical to findings in left heart failure (13). Another study recently 
confirmed these findings through identification of lesser numbers of βARs in circulating mononuclear cells 
in individuals with PAH as compared with healthy controls or those with asthma (15).
Based on these concepts, recent studies have aimed to assess the safety of β-blockers in RV failure and 
the efficacy in preventing and/or reversing of right heart remodeling. β-Blockers improve RV function and

prevent myocardial remodeling in animal models of PH (16, 17). Clinical studies using β-blockers in PAH 
are limited and nonrandomized (7–9, 18–22), but some suggest safety and possible benefits of β-blockers, 
particularly carvedilol, a nonselective β-blocker with vasodilator properties (19). Nonselective β-blockers 
improve cardiac function and restore endothelial function, which make them particularly attractive for 
PAH treatment (16, 17). Here, the safety and possible benefits of the nonselective β-blocker/vasodilator 
carvedilol were evaluated in a 6-month double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial in patients with 
PAH (Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension Treatment with Carvedilol for Heart failure [PAHTCH]). Out￾comes included typical assessments of clinical functions as well as biochemical biomarkers associated with 
mechanisms underlying PAH, i.e., levels of βAR and its signal transducer cyclic adenosine monophosphate 
(cAMP), levels of erythropoietin, and cardiac glucose uptake to assess pathologic hypoxia-inducible events.
Results
Participants
Individuals (n = 321) in a PH registry were reviewed for consideration of being approached for the study 
based on inclusion/exclusion criteria, and availability of individuals for frequent study visits and calls 
over 6 months. Thirty patients were consented and randomized, 10 in each study group (Figure 1). Base￾line characteristics are summarized in Table 1 and detailed PAH-specific therapy in Supplemental Table 
1; supplemental material available online with this article; https://doi.org/10.1172/jci.insight.95240DS1. 
Participants assigned to the dose-escalating carvedilol group were randomly older compared with the pla￾cebo group and the low-fixed-dose group (age [years]: dose-escalating group 53 ± 9; placebo group 38 ± 14; 
low-fixed-dose group 42 ± 6; P = 0.006) (Table 1). A cohort of 12 healthy controls was enrolled in paral￾lel for baseline comparison with the PH subjects. Baseline characteristics are shown in Table 1. Controls 
had similar age, height, gender, and race distribution as PH participants (Supplemental Table 2). Controls 
had lower weight compared with the PH participants (P = 0.002). As expected, the PH group had worse 
right atrial and ventricular functions as determined by echocardiography and elevated N-terminal pro-B￾type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) as compared with healthy controls (Supplemental Table 2). The PH 
group had higher heart rates, supportive of catecholamine overload. PH individuals also had higher glu￾cose uptake as measured by 2-[18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) 
in the right ventricle (23–25). These findings are in support of the well-recognized RV dysfunction and 
glycolytic shift with pathologic activation of hypoxia pathways in PH (23, 24, 26–29).
Outcomes
Safety and tolerability of carvedilol. All 30 participants tolerated the 1-week run-in low-dose carvedilol with 
no significant changes in heart rate (baseline, 78 ± 7; 1-week, 77 ± 8; P = 0.3) and a slight decrease in 
systolic blood pressure (baseline, 119 ± 17; 1-week, 112 ± 13; P = 0.003). Of the 30 enrolled participants, 
29 completed the 6-month study. One participant exited the study at 4 months because of pregnancy. Five 
participants had dose de-escalation: 4 were in the dose-escalating carvedilol group (final dose 12.5 mg [n = 
3] and 3.125 mg [n = 1]) and 1 in the low-fixed-dose carvedilol group (final dose 0 mg). Two participants 
stopped taking the study drug before their last visit (2 months and 3 months prior to last study visit); 1 in 
the placebo group and 1 in the carvedilol dose-escalating group. Fifteen adverse events were identified and 
reported to the IRB (Supplemental Table 3). Thus, although some participants required dose de-escalation 
due to minor adverse effects, carvedilol was safe and well tolerated throughout the study in all participants.
NT-proBNP levels were similar among the 3 groups at all study visits (P > 0.1) and did not change 
significantly over the time of the study in any of the study groups. This indicates that carvedilol therapy did 
not worsen heart failure.
Effects of carvedilol on heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturation, and temperature
Heart rate decreased with carvedilol therapy (Table 2). Even after adjusting for age, the dose-escalating 
carvedilol group tended to have lower heart rates than the placebo group at the 1-month and 3-month visits (P
= 0.05 and 0.07, respectively). Heart rate correlated strongly with pill dosage (mg carvedilol) at the 1-month 
and 3-month visits (R = –0.5, P = 0.006 and R = –0.4, P = 0.04, respectively).
Systolic blood pressure tended to drop in the dose-escalating group at both the 1-month and 3-month 
visits (systolic blood pressure [mmHg]: baseline 122 ± 17; 1-month visit 114 ± 16 [P = 0.04]; 3-month visit

112 ± 19 [P = 0.08]). Diastolic blood pressure dropped at the 1-week 
and 3-month visits compared with baseline in the low-fixed-dose 
group (diastolic blood pressure [mmHg]: baseline 81 ± 12; 1-week 
visit 71 ± 11 [P = 0.05]; 3-month visit 73 ± 15 [P = 0.03]).
Oxygen saturation did not vary over the course of the study 
among the different groups or within each individual study group 
(all P > 0.1). There were no differences in temperature among the 3 
study groups at baseline or at any of the study visits. Temperature 
did not change significantly within any of the study groups over 
time (all P > 0.1). Similarly, weight did not vary over the course 
of the study among the different groups or within each individual 
study group (all P > 0.1). The drops in heart rate and blood pres￾sure with carvedilol therapy were well tolerated and did not lead to 
dose de-escalation.
Pulmonary function during carvedilol therapy
Spirometry and diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monox￾ide (DLCO) were measured at initial visit and at 3 and 6 months 
after randomization. Lung functions were similar among the 
groups at all visits (Table 3). However, within all study groups, 
airflow (forced expiratory volume during first second [FEV1
]) 
decreased at the 3-month visit (change in FEV1
 compared with 
baseline [L] at 3 months: placebo group –0.08 ± 0.1; P = 0.02; 
low-fixed-dose group –0.09 ± 0.14; P = 0.06; dose-escalating 
group –0.17 ± 0.14; P = 0.005). FEV1
% was 5% lower than base￾line in the dose-escalating group at 3 months (P = 0.002). FEV1
and FEV1
% decreased at the 6-month visit only in the low-dose 
group (change in FEV1
 [L]: –0.17 ± 0.16; P = 0.009 and 3% drop 
in FEV1
%: 5 ± 5; P = 0.01). Forced vital capacity (FVC) was not 
different among the 3 study groups over the different visits (all P > 
0.1). FVC and FVC% dropped slightly at the 3-month visit in the 
dose-escalating group (P < 0.001). At the 6-month visit, FVC and 
FVC% decreased in the low-dose group (P = 0.03). The FEV1
/
FVC ratio did not vary within the study groups over time (all P > 
0.1). DLCO and DLCO corrected for alveolar volume (DLCO/
VA) were similar among the 3 study groups at all visits (all P > 0.1) 
(Table 3). Altogether, these findings show that carvedilol therapy 
did not substantially affect lung functions over a 6-month time 
period in PAH individuals. Clinical signs of airflow deterioration 
were not observed. The small but significant decreases in FVC and 
FEV1
 did not require dose adjustment.
Six-minute walk test and heart rate recovery with carvedilol therapy
One of the main reasons for the relative contraindication of β-blockade in PAH is an observed decrease 
in functional capacity, such as 6-minute walk distance, with its use. Here, 6-minute walk was performed 
Figure 2. Heart rate reduction with dose-escalation carvedilol therapy. 
Carvedilol therapy reduced heart rate over the 6-month period in the dose￾escalating group (n = 10 at each time point). The effect was more pro￾nounced at rest and during recovery at 1 minute after a 6-minute walk test. 
The drop in heart rate was not accompanied by a worsening of functional 
capacity as measured by 6-minute walk distance (not shown in figure).

at baseline, after the 1-week run-in visit, and at the 3-month and 6-month visits. There were no significant 
differences in the distance walked among the 3 groups at any visit (all P > 0.1). The changes in the dis￾tance walked over time were not different among the study groups, and there were no significant changes 
in distance walked within any of the groups (all P > 0.1) (Table 2). Oxygen saturation during the walk was 
similar among the groups at all visits without significant changes within the groups (all P > 0.1) (Table 2).
On the other hand, heart rates at peak exercise (6 minute) and 1 minute after exercise were lower in the 
carvedilol dose-escalating group. Heart rate at rest was lower in the dose-escalating carvedilol group at the 
3-month and 6-month visits (Figure 2). After 3 months of carvedilol, the maximal heart rate at the end of 
the 6-minute walk was lower in the dose-escalating group (heart rate at 6-minute walk [beats/min]: baseline 
122 ± 13; 3-month visit 105 ± 17; P = 0.008) (Table 2). Heart rate at 1 minute after the walk was lower in 
the dose-escalating group at the 3-month and 6-month visits (heart rate at 1 minute after walk [beats/min]: 
baseline 100 ± 17; 3-month visit 78 ± 13; P = 0.002; 6-month visit 82 16; P = 0.02) (Table 2). The change 
in heart rate at 1 minute after walk correlated with carvedilol dose at the 3-month visit (R = –0.4, P = 0.03).
Heart rate recovery was faster in the low-fixed-dose compared with the placebo group at the 3-month 
visit (heart rate recovery [beats/min]: placebo group 12 ± 23; low-fixed-dose group 36 ± 19; dose-escalating 
group 27 ± 15; P = 0.03). This difference remained significant after adjusting for age (P = 0.01). Heart rate 
recovery tended to be faster in the dose-escalating carvedilol group at the 6-month visit compared with base￾line (heart rate recovery [beats/min]: baseline 22 ± 16; 6-month visit 30 ± 11; P = 0.06). Overall, carvedilol 
therapy reduced heart rate at rest and at 1-minute postwalk recovery more than at peak exercise. The reduc￾tion in heart rate did not affect exercise capacity as measured by 6-minute walk distance.
Cambridge Pulmonary Hypertension Outcome Review (CAMPHOR)
The CAMPHOR questionnaire is a PH-specific measure and is made up of 3 main scales that assess 
symptoms, functioning, and quality of life (30, 31). The symptom dimension is made up of 25 symptoms 
divided into 3 subscales: energy, breathlessness, and mood. The activity scale has 15 items. The quality￾of-life scale has 25 items, with focus on socialization, role, acceptance, self-esteem, independence,

and security. Scores for quality of life and symptoms range from 
0–25, with higher scores indicating worse quality of life. Activity 
scores range from 0–30, with higher scores indicating greater physical 
limitation. CAMPHOR was completed at baseline, after the 1-week 
run-in, 3-month, and 6-month visits. There were no significant differ￾ences in the scores among the groups at any visit. There was a small 
but significant drop in CAMPHOR score in the low-fixed-dose and 
placebo groups at the 6-month visit (both P = 0.04). Thus, carvedilol 
therapy did not adversely affect CAMPHOR scores over a 6-month 
time period in PH individuals.
Echocardiographic assessment of cardiovascular function
Echocardiography was performed at baseline and at the 3-month and 
6-month visits. The LV parameters, including LV end-diastolic diameter, LV end-systolic diameter, and LV 
ejection fraction, were similar among the study groups and did not vary over time (Table 4). Left atrial area 
was greater in the dose-escalating group compared with other groups at the 3-month and 6-month visits 
but did not significantly change within any of the groups over the course of the study (Table 4). Right atrial 
pressure did not change within groups over the time of the study. Other parameters of RV function and size, 
including RV end-diastolic diameter and RV end-systolic diameter, RV Tei, and tricuspid annular plane sys￾tolic excursion (TAPSE), did not change significantly over the time of the study within groups. However, 
RV systolic pressure (RVSP) at the 3-month visit tended to be higher in the placebo group as compared with 
carvedilol groups (RVSP [mmHg]: placebo group 78 ± 21; P = 0.02; low-fixed-dose group 59 ± 18; P = 
0.06; dose-escalating group 54 ± 24; P = 0.05) (Table 4). RVSP inversely correlated with carvedilol pill dose 
at 3 months (R = –0.4; P = 0.01). RV fractional area change (RVFAC) was higher at the 3-month visit in 
the dose-escalating group and the low-fixed-dose group compared with placebo (Table 4). RV global strain 
was not different among the study groups (Table 4). Stroke volume tended to increase at the 3-month and 
6-month visits compared with baseline in the dose-escalating group (change in stroke volume compared 
with baseline: 3-month visit 13 ± 16; P = 0.03 and 6-month visit 12 ± 19; P = 0.08) (Table 4). Cardiac out￾put (LV CO) was not different among the 3 study groups at any visit and did not vary significantly within 
any of the study groups over the course of the study (all P > 0.1) (Table 4). Altogether, carvedilol therapy 
was not associated with deterioration in cardiac parameters measured by echocardiography. In fact, RV 
function improved in the dose-escalating group in parallel with an increase in LV stroke volume. These 
changes could be a reflection of carvedilol direct effect on the RV or on afterload reduction or even a com￾pensatory mechanism to maintain CO in the face of a reduction in heart rate.
Assessment of hypoxia signaling: cardiac glucose uptake by PET scan and erythropoietin 
level
Erythropoietin was measured at baseline and 1-month, 3-month, and 6-month visits. Erythropoietin levels 
were similar among the PH study groups and did not vary over the time of the study (all P > 0.1).
FDG-PET scan was performed at baseline and at the 6-month visit. LV, RV, and septum FDG uptake were 
measured as maximal standardized uptake values (SUVs) in the LV and RV free walls and septal wall in images 
acquired 90 minutes after injection in the fasting state. The LV FDG uptakes were similar among study groups 
and did not change over the course of the study. The RV/LV FDG-uptake ratio was used to assess relative differ￾ences in RV FDG uptake among groups and among individuals over time. RV/LV FDG uptake was not differ￾ent among the groups at baseline or at the 6-month follow up visit (both P > 0.1). However, RV/LV FDG uptake 
decreased in the dose-escalating carvedilol group at the 6-month visit (RV/LV FDG uptake median [25%, 75%]: 
baseline 0.9 (0.5, 1.5), 6-month visit 0.7 (0.4, 1.0); log-transformed values: baseline –0.2 (–1.0, 0.6), 6-month visit

values. Horizontal lines represent means. Values of SUV are shown plotted on

–0.5 (–1.2, –0.08); paired t test P = 0.04) (Figure 3 and Table 5). RV/LV FDG uptake correlated with heart rate at 
1 minute after the 6-minute walk (R = 0.4; P = 0.03) and with RVSP (R = 0.5; P = 0.002) at 6-month visit (Figure 
4). The baseline RV/LV FDG uptake correlated to echocardiographic measurements at baseline as recently pub￾lished (24). The relationship of FDG uptake with heart rate, a correlate of the β-blocker efficaciousness, suggests 
the decrease in glucose uptake is related to carvedilol therapy. Overall, carvedilol therapy over a 6-month period 
led to reduced RV/LV uptake of glucose, suggesting that carvedilol improved RV function.
βAR expression
Flow cytometry with alprenolol binding was used to quantify βAR density on circulating white blood cells. 
βAR density was similar among groups at baseline and 6 months (Table 5). However, the change in βAR 
density relative to baseline was dose-dependently related to the carvedilol dose (0 mg, –0.11 ± 0.26; 3.125 
mg, 0.004 ± 0.237; 12.5 mg, 0.025 ± 0.198; 25 mg, 0.110 ± 0.250; R = 0.3; P = 0.02) (Figure 5). The greatest 
increase in βAR density was found in those individuals on the highest dose of carvedilol (P = 0.02).
Urinary cAMP
βAR activation in cardiac muscles is associated with increased cAMP as downstream signaling. Uri￾nary cAMP/creatinine is a measure of βAR function (32), and was used to assess βAR recovery with 
carvedilol. Urinary cAMP/creatinine was highest in the placebo group at baseline but did not change over

time in the placebo group (Table 5). In contrast, urinary cAMP/
creatinine tended to increase in the low-fixed-dose carvedilol group 
(P = 0.07) and the dose-escalating carvedilol group over time (P = 
0.04) (Figure 6).
Carvedilol effects compared with placebo based on heart 
rate
To further evaluate the effect of carvedilol, all participants receiv￾ing carvedilol, either low-fixed-dose or dose-escalating, were com￾pared with those participants receiving placebo. At 3-month visit, 
heart rate at rest was lower in the carvedilol group compared with 
placebo (heart rate [beats/min]: placebo group 78 ± 10, carvedilol 
group 70 ± 10; P = 0.04). Heart rate at the end of walk at 6 minutes 
was similar among the 2 groups (P = 0.3), but heart rate at 1 minute 
after walk decreased at the 3-month visit in the treatment group 
(heart rate 1 minute after walk: baseline 98 ± 16, 3-month visit 83 
± 12; P < 0.001), but not in the placebo group (heart rate 1 minute 
after walk: baseline 97 ± 14, 3-month visit 91 ± 22; P = 0.2). Heart 
rate recovery was fastest in the carvedilol group at the 3-month visit 
(P = 0.05) and significantly faster than in the placebo group (heart 
rate recovery [beats/min]: carvedilol group 32 ± 17, placebo group 
12 ± 22; P = 0.01). At the 6-month visit, heart rate differences could 
not be appreciated (all P > 0.1).
Next, to adjust for dose de-escalation, variable adherence, and/or drop out, heart rate at rest was used 
as a physiologic surrogate of carvedilol effect among the population at 6 months. Heart rate correlated with 
parameters of right heart dysfunction by echocardiography, including with RVSP (R = 0.5; P < 0.001) and 
inversely with RVFAC (R = 0.5; P < 0.001). Heart rate correlated with cardiac RV/LV FDG uptake (R = 
0.4; P = 0.002). These findings suggest that higher heart rates are associated with disease severity and dos￾ing of carvedilol to achieve heart rate reductions may be of benefit to PAH. However, as the increased heart 
rate in this population is presumably a compensation for reduced stroke volume, introducing carvedilol 
should be performed under close observation to monitor for any decompensation.
Changes in heart rate and RV metabolism excluding non–group 1 PAH
The study cohort included 4 non–group 1 PH patients. To evaluate if non–group 1 PAH patient data influ￾enced the findings, the data were also analyzed after excluding the 4 non–group 1 subjects. Similar to the 
entire cohort, dose-escalating carvedilol therapy decreased heart rate at rest (P = 0.007) and 1 minute after 
recovery (P = 0.01) without affecting heart rate at the end of the walk at 6 minutes (P = 0.1). Similarly, RV 
glucose uptake decreased in the dose-escalating group 1 patients at 6-month visit compared with baseline 
(RV/LV FDG uptake median [25%, 75%]: baseline 0.9 [0.5, 1.5], 6-month visit 0.7 [0.4, 1.0]; log-trans￾formed values: baseline –0.2 [–1.0, 0.6], 6-month visit –0.5 [–1.2, –0.08]; paired t test P = 0.01). There were 
no significant changes in NT-proBNP or 6-minute walk distance over the time of the study in group 1 PAH 
patients participating in any of the study arms (all P > 0.05).
The findings support the effect of carvedilol on cardiac metabolism and heart rate in RV dysfunction regard￾less of the PH group.
Discussion
The PAHTCH trial reveals that carvedilol is safe and has potential benefits over 6 months for individuals with 
PAH. Carvedilol was well tolerated, as evidenced by low numbers of adverse events requiring dose reductions.

Carvedilol lowered heart rate and accelerated heart rate recovery 
from exercise, but did not decrease exercise capacity. Carvedilol 
decreased RV glycolytic rate, and had no evidence of RV function￾al deterioration; rather, RV improvements were seen and cardiac 
output was maintained. The beneficial effects were associated 
with recovery of βAR as measured by receptor density.
This double-blinded randomized study provides new data 
that advance our knowledge of β-blocker use in PAH. Never￾theless, previous studies supported the concept for this study. In 
a small single-arm study, β-blocker use in patients after correc￾tion of transposition of the great arteries showed improvement 
in symptoms, quality of life, and RV ejection fraction (22). In a 
prospective open-label study involving 94 patients with PAH, So 
et al. showed that, in the 28% of patients who were prescribed a 
variety of β-blockers, there were no greater adverse clinical or hemodynamic consequences associated with 
the administration of those drugs (21). The study had limitations in that it was nonrandomized, and there 
were differences in PAH subtypes, exercise capacity, and accompanying diseases between groups treated 
with and without β-blockers. In another small pilot study, Grinnan et al. evaluated carvedilol in patients with 
stable PAH and RV dysfunction (functional classes II and III) using cardiac magnetic resonance to measure 
interval changes in RV dimensions and systolic function (19). They showed that carvedilol was safe, and that 
there was an improvement in RV ejection fraction (19). In another small study, bisoprolol was well toler￾ated in patients with PAH, but without appreciable benefits; there was a possible decrease in cardiac index 
and 6-minute walk distance (20). In retrospective analysis using propensity score matching, β-blocker use 
in patients with PAH was associated with similar survival and time to clinical worsening as compared with 
patients not receiving them (18). To the best of our knowledge this study is the first double-blinded, random￾ized, controlled trial using carvedilol at varying doses. Consistent with other studies, carvedilol was safe and 
tolerated, but unlike the bisoprolol study, there were no adverse functional effects. Further work is needed to 
determine the ideal class of β-blocker.
Although βAR antagonists provide survival benefits in left heart failure, the benefits are also not consis￾tent among the different β-blocker classes. Three different classes of β-blockers have been tried in left heart

CLINICAL MEDICINE
failure (3, 33). First-generation nonselective β-blockers are deleterious in heart failure, leading to an initial 
contraindication to their use. Selective β1
-blockers were developed and found to improve outcomes in clini￾cal trials (3, 4, 34). Later, with discovery of β2
-AR in cardiomyocytes, non-selective β-blockers were devel￾oped to block both β1
- and β2
-ARs and the vasoconstrictive response through α blockade, i.e., β-blocker/
vasodilators. This drug class improved outcomes in heart failure in large clinical trials (35, 36). Carvedilol 
is a nonsubtype-selective β-blocker/vasodilator that has particularly beneficial effects in heart failure due 
to several unique features of effects. Lipid peroxidation is a major mechanism of myocardial tissue and 
endothelial injury in heart failure. Carvedilol, but not other β-blockers, scavenges free radicals and inhibits 
lipid peroxidation in myocardial cell membranes initiated by oxygen radicals (37, 38). Oxidative stress 
contributes to cardiomyocyte apoptotic death, and carvedilol inhibits apoptotic death (39, 40). Classical 
signaling through βAR activation is through heterotrimeric G proteins and the second messenger cAMP, 
but studies over the past decade show that the βARs exist in multiple active conformations with distinct 
signaling properties (41). β-Arrestins 1 and 2 bind to active phosphorylated βARs and terminate further 
receptor-stimulated G protein activation (42). Carvedilol stimulates β-arrestin–mediated signaling, which 
may account for many of its unique benefits (43). In addition, carvedilol was recently shown to cause vaso￾dilation by increasing nitric oxide release from endothelial cells (44). The greater nitric oxide release from 
PAH endothelial cells with carvedilol is due to restoration of the endothelial nitric oxide synthase enzy￾matic activity (45). All these effects of carvedilol were important in our choice of β-blocker in PAHTCH. 
The dose of carvedilol chosen in this study was based on left heart failure studies (35). Like left heart fail￾ure, sympathetic hyperactivity is described in PAH and correlates with disease severity (10, 46). Ciarka et 
al. have shown that sympathetic hyperactivity is an independent predictor of clinical deterioration in PAH 
(46). Treatment with β-blockers in left heart failure decreases sympathetic activity, and decreases mortality; 
the dose of β-blocker is maximally adjusted to lower heart rate for best outcomes. In this study, carvedilol 
lowered the resting heart rate in PAH without affecting exercise capacity. Intriguingly, there were also 
benefits to the low-dose arm, suggesting that unlike left heart failure, RV failure in PAH may benefit from 
a low dose of carvedilol, perhaps related to its noncanonical effects on cardiomyocytes and endothelium.
Heart rate recovery after exercise testing has been shown to be a powerful and independent predictor 
of increased risk of death in all individuals (47). Exercise is associated with increased sympathetic and 
decreased parasympathetic activity, and the period of recovery after maximal exercise is characterized by a 
combination of sympathetic withdrawal and parasympathetic reactivation. Heart rate recovery after graded 
exercise is one of the commonly used techniques that reflects autonomic activity and predicts cardiovascu￾lar events and mortality (47). In PAH, heart rate recovery is a strong predictor of clinical worsening (48). In 
left heart disease, heart rate recovery is mediated by the vagal response rather than a chronotropic response. 
In a left heart failure study by Karnik et al., heart rate recovery was not different in patients treated with 
β-blockers compared with patients not on β-blockers (49). However, patients with positive stress tests, i.e., 
ischemia, had a blunted heart rate recovery that improved with β-blockade (49). The data suggest that an 
accelerated heart rate recovery after exercise in patients treated with β-blockers may be related to ischemia 
and/or an upregulation of βARs. Independent of the mechanism, the finding that carvedilol significantly 
accelerates heart rate recovery in PAH suggests that a longer-term study might identify differences in mor￾tality in those individuals using carvedilol.
To quantitatively assess adherence to drug therapy, we measured βARs and levels of cAMP. These were 
used as markers of carvedilol therapy rather than outcomes of therapy. Similar to prior work in left heart 
failure (50), βARs increased in a dose-dependent manner with carvedilol. Cardiac and lymphocyte βAR 
density have been shown to change in response to β-blocker therapy (50, 51); however, there are no studies 
correlating βAR density on mononuclear cells to receptor density on cardiovascular cells. Similarly, urinary 
cAMP, a surrogate of β-adrenergic recovery, increased with carvedilol. Importantly, while these changes 
suggest adherence to drug therapy, their role in the mechanism of action in PAH needs further investiga￾tion. Effects of carvedilol on pathobiologic mechanisms of PAH were also evaluated. As in prior studies 
(23, 24, 27, 29), RV glycolytic uptake was increased in PAH hearts as compared with controls. This study 
now shows that carvedilol lowers RV glucose uptake relative to the LV. This could be related to improve￾ments in blood flow to the myocardium, perhaps by decreasing metabolic load on the myocardium with 
β-blockade or to a decrease in afterload due to pulmonary vasodilation. Decreasing heart rate and systolic 
blood pressure with carvedilol will reduce oxygen consumption. In addition, βARs have recently been 
implicated in hypoxia sensing (52). Cheong et al. have shown that β-blockade suppresses hypoxic induction 

insight.jci.org   https://doi.org/10.1172/jci.insight.95240 1 4
CLINICAL MEDICINE
of gene expression, such as erythropoietin (52). Thus, β-blockade may also directly abrogate hypoxia sens￾ing in the PAH myocardium. Here, erythropoietin levels did not change with carvedilol, but time and dose 
of drug may have been insufficient to see an effect.
This study has limitations. One limitation was the unexpected difference in age among the study 
groups, with the dose-escalating carvedilol group being older than the other 2 groups. This discrepancy in 
age occurred despite the fact that this was a randomized study. When analyzing the data, we adjusted for 
age in statistical analyses.
Another limitation of the study is the lack of invasive hemodynamic measurements at baseline and 
on follow up. The historical hemodynamics suggest some differences among the study groups. However, 
based on the data collected at baseline, the echocardiographic measurements are similar among the groups. 
Moreover, echocardiographic measurements suggest improved RV function and/or reduction in RV after￾load on follow-up study visits; hemodynamics would have been the most reliable measure of safety and 
lack of decompensation in the treatment group. A larger study with hemodynamic measurements is war￾ranted to more definitively confirm the safety of carvedilol in PAH. Along these lines, another suggestion 
for future studies is to have patients undergo cardiopulmonary exercise testing in order to better understand 
the effects of carvedilol therapy and the reduction in heart rate on exercise.
A potential limitation in any oral treatment trial is adherence. Pill counts were performed at each 
study visit to detect errors or nonadherence. Even with this check, by the last study visit, 2 participants had 
stopped taking medications. Given this was an intention-to-treat study, those patients remained in their 
assigned groups for analysis. Dose de-escalation led to a lower number of patients on high-dose carvedilol 
by the end of the study. At the 6-month visit, only 5 patients were taking the maximum dose (25 mg twice 
daily) of carvedilol. To address issues with adherence and dose reduction, urinary cAMP and βAR were 
measured as surrogates of carvedilol effect. 
Another limitation is numbers of participants and duration of this early-phase study. A larger 
sample size might have shown more significant changes. Furthermore, changes with β-blocker therapy 
become more pronounced over time in left heart disease; it is unclear what time period would be 
best to study β-blocker effects in PAH. A prospective study of larger numbers may require a 2-year 
longitudinal assessment. Likewise, the majority of participants in the study were within WHO group 
1 PAH, with only 4 participants within WHO groups 3 and 4. The group 3 participants had PH dis￾proportionate to their lung disease and were on pulmonary vasodilators. The inclusion of non–group 
1 subjects did not alter the effects of carvedilol on heart rate and RV metabolism. Although there were 
no apparent differences in response to carvedilol by PH type, further studies are needed to determine 
if responses vary by PH class. 
Based on the current study, carvedilol is safe and has potential benefits linked to improved outcomes, 
such as accelerated heart rate recovery and lower RV glycolytic rate.
Methods
Selection of patients. Participants were 18 to 65 years of age, WHO functional class I, II, or III, with a 
diagnosis of idiopathic PAH, hereditary PAH, or PAH associated with connective tissue disease, drugs, 
or toxins, human immunodeficiency virus, or repaired congenital heart defects (group 1 of the WHO clas￾sification of PH), and PH WHO groups 3 and 4. Diagnosis of PH was confirmed by review of right 
heart catheterization showing a mean pulmonary arterial pressure of 25 mmHg or greater and pulmonary 
vascular resistance more than 3 Wood units. Enrolled participants must have been stable on approved PH 
medications for the 30 days prior to enrollment. A full set of inclusion and exclusion criteria are provided 
in NCT01586156. All participants provided written informed consent. The target of the study was to enroll 
30 participants, 10 in each arm.
Study intervention. After screening and consent, all eligible patients were admitted overnight to the Clin￾ical Research Unit of the Cleveland Clinic to start the open-label challenge of carvedilol. If the patient 
tolerated this dose (assessed by symptoms and vital signs including blood pressure and pulse), the patient 
was then discharged home to continue on the drug at 3.125 mg twice daily for the remainder of the week. A 
group of healthy controls was enrolled as a comparison group and underwent baseline testing. The control 
group was not part of the intervention study.
Patients were provided with a blood pressure monitor for home use and instructed to check their 
blood pressure and pulse as directed, and were contacted daily during the first week to check on vital 

insight.jci.org   https://doi.org/10.1172/jci.insight.95240 1 5
CLINICAL MEDICINE
signs and symptoms. Patients returned to clinic after 1 week. Patients who were able to complete the 
1-week run-in phase without adverse effects were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to 1 of 3 arms for 24 weeks 
of treatment with placebo, low-fixed-dose carvedilol, or dose-escalating carvedilol to maximum tolerated 
dose. Blocked randomization was used. The block sizes were random and known only to the research 
pharmacist who performed the randomization and knew treatment assignment at time of enrollment. 
The first group received a placebo drug, the second group carvedilol at a fixed dose of 3.125 mg twice 
daily, and the third group a weekly escalating dose of carvedilol to the maximal dose of 25 mg twice 
daily. Participants continued to be treated by their PAH physicians as needed, including changes in dos￾ing of their PAH medications.
Safety monitoring parameters were collected via weekly phone calls and at all follow-up visits. Subjects 
received weekly phone calls after starting the study and had study visits at week 1 and months 1, 3, and 6 
to evaluate side effects, to monitor clinical status, and to collect outcome data. Patients were instructed to 
call if systolic blood pressure was less than 85 mmHg or pulse was less than 55, or if there were any adverse 
events such as hospitalization or unscheduled doctor visits. Subjects were asked whether they had experi￾enced any side effects and to describe these symptoms, as well as to provide the blood pressure and heart 
rate home records, which were kept in the electronic medical record. Subjects were monitored throughout 
their enrollment, especially in regards to any deaths or hospitalizations during the study. Safety and tol￾erability outcomes and any other adverse events that occurred were recorded in the patient’s electronic 
medical record. If a dose was not tolerated, the dose was decreased to the prior week’s tolerated dose for 
the remainder of the study. A list of side effects that instigated a de-escalation of the dose is provided in 
Supplemental Table 3.
Any adverse events were investigated to identify possible etiology and relationship to study procedures 
and were reported to the IRB and the Data and Safety Monitoring (DSM) committee within 10 working 
days of their discovery, with the exception of any deaths, which were reported within 5 working days of 
their discovery.
Subjects were asked to bring the study medication and bottles with them to each follow-up visit. A 
tablet count was performed to estimate compliance. Subjects were also asked how many tablets per day 
they were taking on average, and how many times per week they had missed a dose. In addition, surrogate 
measures of adherence, including heart rate and cell surface βARs, were evaluated in the study.
Study assessments. Outcome data included safety, tolerability, clinical assessments of heart and lung 
functions, and biologic measures of pathologic hypoxia activation and endothelial dysfunction. Primary 
outcome was the measure of glucose uptake on cardiac FDG-PET scans. The various outcome data were 
collected at the baseline visit and at follow-up visits at week 1 and months 1, 3, and 6. Safety monitoring 
parameters were collected at all visits and via weekly phone calls throughout the study period.
The supplement includes all additional methods including echocardiogram, FDG-PET scan, and mea￾surements of erythropoietin levels, βAR, urinary cAMP, and NT-proBNP.
Outcome measures. The primary end point of the study was assessment of myocardial glucose uptake 
during fasting gated FDG-PET. FDG-PET scan measurements at week 24 were compared with baseline 
measurements. Prespecified secondary efficacy end points were changes from baseline in echocardiograph￾ic parameters, NT-proBNP level, 6-minute walk distance, WHO functional class, and CAMPHOR score. 
Safety assessments included laboratory measurements and evaluation of adverse events. All-cause mortal￾ity and hospitalizations were recorded for all participants in the study.
Dosing. To further evaluate the effect of carvedilol dosage on the different parameters and to account 
for compliance and de-escalation, we calculated the dose at each of the study visits per participant. The 
cumulative dose was calculated as the total dosage of carvedilol taken by the participant up to the visit 
day. The pill dose at time of the visit is the single dosage of medication taken at the time of the visit.
Statistics. The target total was 10 participants in each study arm. Sample size was determined by taking 
into account the power of a t test comparing the placebo and carvedilol groups with respect to the reduc￾tion in FDG-PET uptake, as measured by the log-ratios of 6-month uptake to baseline uptake. Quantitative 
variables were summarized with means and standard deviations or medians and interquartile ranges as 
appropriate, while categorical variables were summarized as frequencies and percentages. The primary out￾come and many secondary quantitative measures were anticipated to have positively skewed distributions, 
amenable to the use of log ratios of 1-, 3-, and 6-month measures relative to baseline to measure changes 
over time and achieve approximately normal distributions. For measures demonstrating less skewness or 

insight.jci.org   https://doi.org/10.1172/jci.insight.95240 1 6
CLINICAL MEDICINE
even approximate normality without log transformation, absolute changes from baseline to 1, 3, and 6 
months were used to measure change over time. For quantitative measures in the randomized study groups, 
changes from baseline were compared using analysis of variance (ANOVA) at 0.05 significance levels, 
with pairwise group comparisons performed with 2-tailed t tests at Bonferroni-adjusted significance levels. 
Within groups, changes were assessed for statistical significance using paired t tests, with Bonferroni-adjust￾ed significance levels applied when changes to multiple time points were considered. Covariate-adjusted 
comparisons were performed in the event that the randomized groups differed notably by any subject 
demographic characteristics. Associations among quantitative measures were assessed using Pearson cor￾relations. For comparison of PH subjects with controls, 1–sided t test was used at 0.05 significance levels.
Study design and approval. The PAHTCH trial is a double-blinded, randomized, controlled intervention 
with 3 arms preceded by an open-label 1-week run-in period (Figure 7) (NCT01586156). It was conduct￾ed from 2012 to 2016 at the Cleveland Clinic. The IRB at Cleveland Clinic approved the study (number 
11-1198). All participants provided informed consent prior to their participation in the study. A DSM 
committee composed of 3 physicians with expertise in heart failure and PH management and a biostatisti￾cian held scheduled meetings to maintain oversight of the trial progress. The study drug and placebo were 
prepared by the Cleveland Clinic Research pharmacy.
