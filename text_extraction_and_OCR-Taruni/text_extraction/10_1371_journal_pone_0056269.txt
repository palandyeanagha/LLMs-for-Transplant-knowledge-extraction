Abstract
Cryptococcal meningitis (CM) causes significant morbidity and mortality globally; however, recent national trends have not
been described. Incidence and trends for CM-associated hospitalizations in 18 states were estimated using the Agency for
Healthcare and Research Quality (AHRQ) State Inpatient Databases (SID) datasets for 1997 through 2009. We identified
30,840 hospitalizations coded for CM, of which 21.6% were among HIV-uninfected patients. CM in-hospital mortality was
significant (12.4% for women and 10.8% for men) with a total of 3,440 deaths over the study period. Co-morbidities of CM
coded at increased frequency in HIV-uninfected CM hospitalized populations included hydrocephalus and acute/chronic
renal failure as well as possible predispositions including transplantation, combined T and B cell defects, Cushing’s
syndrome, liver disease and hypogammaglobulinemia. Median hospitalization costs were significant for CM and higher for
HIV-uninfected patients (16,803.01 vs. 15,708.07; p,0.0001). Cryptococcal meningitis remains a disease with significant
morbidity and mortality in the U.S. and the relative burden among persons without HIV infection is increasing.

Introduction
Cryptococcal meningitis (CM) is a disease with significant
morbidity and mortality that afflicts both immunecompetent
and immune compromised hosts. Globally, approximately 1
million AIDS-related cases of cryptococcosis occur annually with
more than 600,000 associated deaths, predominantly within the
developing world where anti-retroviral therapy is less available
[1]. At the same time, within the developed world, AIDS￾related opportunistic infections such as CM have declined
significantly [2], although widespread use of immunosuppression
therapy for transplant conditioning and cancer chemotherapy
has increased the size of populations susceptible to opportunistic
infections such as CM. In addition, an increased recognition of
cryptococcosis in apparently normal hosts is highlighted by
a recent outbreak of cases in the Pacific Northwest centered in
Vancouver Island in British Columbia, Canada [3]. Patients
who survive CM may have long-term sequelae related to their
infection such as focal neurologic deficits, blindness, deafness,
cranial nerve palsies and memory deficits, and may require
prolonged therapy or experience disease relapses [4].
Prior to the AIDS epidemic, cryptococcal infection was
reported in less than 500 patients globally in the decade of the
1950’s [5], rising to 338 confirmed cases per year within the
U.S. alone in 1976 [6]. This was followed by an explosion in
cases with the advent of the AIDS pandemic [7] and
a precipitous decline with the introduction of highly active
anti-retroviral therapy (ART) [8]. However, while important risk
factor and management issues have been elucidated from
detailed studies in single centers or within specific risk groups
such as transplant recipients [2,9,10], no current nationally￾representative data for the U.S. exist regarding the incidence of
cryptococcosis in these diverse patient groups, particularly the
HIV-uninfected. Thus, in an effort to better understand the
burden of cryptococcal disease in the United States in the post￾ART era, we used data from the State Inpatient Databases of
the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ)
through an active collaboration to describe the incidence of
hospitalizations associated with cryptococcal meningitis, the
most serious manifestation of cryptococcosis, during a 13 year
period 1997–2009, and including both HIV-infected and
uninfected populations in the U.S. AHRQ belongs to the
Department of Health and Human Services and has compiled
state level hospital discharge information since 1988 as part of
the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (SID; www.hcup-us.
ahrq.gov). These data illustrate a complex epidemiology, with
a moderate decline in HIV-related CM and a persistence of
non-HIV CM. Given that non-HIV CM is becoming a more
significant subpopulation in the U.S. CM patient burden, we
also conducted a national analysis of CM co-morbidities in the
HIV-uninfected population to better understand possible risk
factors and complications within this heterogeneous population.

Methods
Data Source and Study Population
This analysis was performed using the State Inpatient Databases
(SID). In 2010, SID encompassed approximately 95% of U.S.
hospital discharges from 44 states. Our study period included the
years 1997 through 2009 and was limited to the 18 states that
reported continuously during this period, containing information
from over 200 million discharges. These 18 states represent over
50% of the total US population. Data were extracted as described
[11] from the intramural databases maintained by AHRQ using
the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision,
Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) code for CM (321.0). Because
the data was de-identified and not collected for research purposes
by hospitals, the study was not considered human subject research
by the National Institutes of Health Office of Human Subjects
Protection.
The study population included all hospitalizations with
a discharge diagnosis code for CM as either the principal
diagnosis or any of 9 secondary diagnoses. This approach of
using multiple secondary diagnoses was used to reduce bias due
to secular trends in documentation and coding priorities as
recently described in studies of pneumonia [12]. Hospitalizations
with any discharge diagnosis of HIV/AIDS were identified
using ICD-9-CM code 042. To calculate age-, sex- and state￾specific deaths and estimates, we used age- and sex-specific
census data, which were available from the U.S. census. We
used the study midpoint year, 2003 for a population de￾nominator when calculating rates over a period. The annual
population was used as the denominator when calculating
annual estimates. HIV incidences were determined for the 18
participating states using the CDC HIV incident database.
Epidemiological information included age, sex, co-morbidities
and in-hospital mortality, the latter as defined by Lindenauer
et al. [12]. To describe the most common co-morbid conditions
associated with CM in our study population (Table 1), we
assessed diagnosis claims among persons with CM. We
identified the most common co-morbid conditions as well as
the conditions with known or suspected associations with CM.
Some co-morbid conditions were grouped. For example,
hematological malignancies were grouped because none showed
a strong relationship individually and non-tuberculous myco￾bacterial disease (NTM) was grouped with TB to improve its
positive predictive value due to previous studies showing
ambiguities introduced from inclusion of patients being evalu￾ated for TB, found on subsequent culture to have non￾tuberculous mycobacteria [13]. Relative prevalence for each
co-morbidity was calculated as the ratio of the frequency of
a given ICD-9 diagnosis among CM patients in 2009 compared
with the overall proportion of the same diagnostic code among
all hospitalizations for the same period. Significance of the
relative prevalence was determined, adjusting for multiple
comparisons as described below.
Statistical Analysis
Associations among categorical variables were assessed using the
Chi-square test (survival comparisons, comparisons of men with
disease, among all men, compared to women with disease, among
all women) and the Wilcoxon test was used for non-parametric
comparisons, with statistical significance assessed at p,0.05.
Poisson regression was used to estimate trends in hospitalizations
and in-hospital mortality, using the Annual Percent Change (APC)
to quantify the rate. Significance of relative prevalence of co￾morbidities using Chi-square was determined as p,0.0001, to
adjust for multiple comparisons (200 ICD-9 codes compared)
using a Bonferroni correction. Statistical analysis was performed
using SAS version 9.2 (SAS, Cary, NC) and Prism ver. 5.0
(Graphpad Software).
Results
A total of 30,840 CM hospitalizations were documented over
the 13 year period, with a total of 1827 hospitalizations recorded
in the most current year (2009). Of those, 24,151 (79.4%) were
associated with HIV and 6,689 (21.6%) were not associated with
an ICD-9-CM code for HIV/AIDS (042). Based on state
population data from the U.S. census in the mid-study year
2003, our analysis included approximately 53.5% of the country’s
population during that period. Extrapolating our data to a US
population of 307 million in the last study year (2009), we
estimated approximately 3,400 hospitalizations associated with
CM annually in the US for the most current year for which data
was available.
Rates of HIV-related CM were higher in states with a higher
prevalence of HIV infection such as NY, Florida, Maryland and
Georgia (Fig. 1A), although high rates of hospitalizations were also
evident in the southeastern U.S. (average of 19.4 hospitalizations
per million population in TN, GA, SC and FL) with up to 33
hospitalizations per million population in GA. This geographic
trend was also evident in non-HIV-related hospitalizations with
higher rates in the southeastern states of TN, GA and SC and up
to 7.6 hospitalizations per million population in TN (Fig. 1B).
Trends of Total Hospitalizations
CM hospitalizations decreased in the HIV-infected patient
population during the study period with a high of 16.6
hospitalizations/million total population in 1997 to 7.7 in 2009
(53.6% decline) with the annual percentage change (APC) showing
a significant decline of -5.8% (95% CI:-6.5, -5.0) over the time
period (Figure 2A). This is comparable to a 53% decline in
hospitalization rates due to pneumocystis pneumonia identified
from the HCUP database [14] in 11 of the 18 states reporting to
this database over the same period (ICD9 code: 136.3). Total
hospitalizations among HIV-uninfected individuals also decreased
over the study period from 756 hospitalizations per million
population in 1997 to 639 hospitalizations/million population in
2009 (APC: -1.7; 95% CI:-2.2,-1.2), which was a slower rate than
CM-associated admissions, suggesting that the decrease in CM
was not solely due to the overall decrease in HIV hospitalizations.
The incidence of non-HIV CM-associated hospitalizations also
declined slightly during the study period but at a rate slower than
that of HIV-associated CM (Fig. 2A; APC: -1.2; CI-2.0, -0.4). The
proportion of non-HIV hospitalizations among all CM hospitali￾zations thus increased during the study period from 16% in 1997
to approximately 29% during the most recent reporting period.
Men predominated among persons hospitalized with CM, in both
HIV-infected (78.2%, p,0.0001) as well as HIV-uninfected
populations (67.6%, p,0.0001). In the HIV-infected group, rates
of hospitalization per million total population peaked in the 31–40
age range, similar to that for the underlying HIV-infected
population. In contrast, the highest rates of hospitalizations for
CM in the HIV-uninfected group were shifted towards older age
groups with a peak seen in the 51–60 age group.
In-hospital Mortality
We identified a total of 3,440 CM-associated deaths over the
13 year study period with 338 deaths from CM in the first
study year, decreasing to 177 deaths in 2009, with an
Cryptococcal Meningitis in the U.S.
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 February 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 2 | e56269

extrapolated total estimate in the US of 330 deaths in 2009.
The incidence of in-hospital mortality decreased over the study
period in both the HIV-infected (APC:-7.8%;CI:-8.8,-6.7) and
HIV-uninfected patients (APC:-4.4;CI:-5.9,-2.8) (Fig. 2B), al￾though a higher proportion of CM hospitalizations ended in
death among the HIV-uninfected than among the HIV-infected
patients (13.3% vs. 10.5%; p,0.0001).
Co-morbidities of HIV-Uninfected Patients
Using the SID database, we calculated relative prevalence
(RP) of co-morbid conditions, comparing the proportion of
hospitalizations with selected comorbid conditions among those
with CM to those without. A number of well-known sequelae of
CM were identified as significant after adjustment for multivari￾able comparisons including hydrocephalus (RP: 51) [15] and
acute/chronic renal failure (RP: 5.8 and 1.6, respectively), the
latter likely due to the use of renal-toxic amphotericin B
preparations. Co-morbidities that could represent risk factors for
CM included hematopoietic tumors (RP: 9.0), and a variety of
conditions associated with immunosuppression including leuko￾penia (RP: 5.4), sarcoidosis (RP: 9.6), T cell defects (RP: 88),
hypogammaglobulinemia (RP: 36), combined B- and T-cell
defects (59), and Cushing syndrome (RP: 25). In addition,
relationships were also evident with a number of solid organ
transplant populations that require immunosuppressant medica￾tions, including kidney (RP: 36) and pancreatic (RP: 51).
Furthermore, relationships were evident with a variety of
rheumatologic diseases including dermatomyositis (RP: 17) and
systemic lupus erythematosis (5.4), which could be related to
steroid use, known to be a risk factor for CM [16].
Interestingly, a number of codes related to liver disease: liver
failure (RP: 6.1), autoimmune hepatitis (RP: 10) and liver
cirrhosis (RP: 2.8), were frequent co-morbidities and significantly
associated with CM. In addition, co-infections causing viral
hepatitis (RP: 2.6) and other fungal infections including oral and
invasive candidiasis (RP: 4.9 and 7.3, respectively) as well as
diseases caused by intracellular pathogens such as mycobacterial
diseases (RP: 17) were also more common among patients
hospitalized with CM compared with all patients.

Financial Burden of CM
The median cost of CM for HIV-uninfected patients was
estimated to be $16,803 and $15,708 for HIV-infected patients.
This includes only hospitalization costs and does not include
outpatient, rehabilitation or lost income estimates. In addition,
highest hospitalization costs were found in NY, CT, NJ and MD
with an average cost of $17,200 to a low of $12,100 per
hospitalization in WA and OR. Hospitalizations were also higher
in patients who did not survive, vs. those who did survive ($21,000
vs. $14,400; p,0.001). Based on an estimated number of
hospitalizations of 3400 for CM, approximately USD $54 million
were spent per year on these direct hospitalization-associated costs
associated with CM in the U.S. in 2009.
Discussion
Here we present nationally-representative population-based
estimates for incidence of CM hospitalizations over a 13-year
period. These findings from the SID represent the largest
epidemiological study of CM in the U.S to include both HIV￾infected and uninfected patients representing data from approx￾imately 200 million hospital admissions from both academic and
community hospitals. We found a declining incidence of CM

hospitalizations associated with HIV as reported earlier [17], and
in a more recent single center study at Duke University [9], with
a stable incidence of CM among non-HIV associated CM
hospitalizations, leading to a relative increase in the proportion
of non-HIV CM. This decline was similar to the predominately
HIV-related opportunistic infection, pneumocystis pneumonia,
using a similar HCUP database [14]. Widespread availability of
ART beginning in 1997 likely contributed to the decrease in
hospitalizations of these opportunistic infections in HIV-infected
patients [2]. More prevalent use of antifungal prophylaxis may
also have had an impact [18]. In contrast, hospitalizations in HIV￾uninfected patients have been more persistent, increasing the
representation of HIV- uninfected patients among CM hospita￾lizations over time. The rates of hospitalizations were particularly
high in the S.E. U.S. with a burden of disease that was similar to
that of endemic fungi in this region, such as histoplasmosis (16
hospitalizations per 1,000,000 US population), determined earlier
using a similar AHRQ-derived database [19]. The significantly
higher proportion of hospitalizations among men in HIV-infected
patient populations was not surprising because of higher rates of
HIV in males. However, the proportion of males was also higher
in HIV-uninfected populations, consistent with smaller studies
where male gender was a risk factor for cryptococcal disease
among immunocompetent individuals [20,21]. This male pre￾dominance of infection parallels other fungal diseases such as
pulmonary blastomycosis [22] and could suggest an environmental
influence on exposure, especially since Cryptococcus is present in
bird droppings, decaying wood and soil [23] and likely represents
an increased risk of environmental exposure.
In-hospital mortality decreased over the study period for both
HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected patients. This improvement is
likely multifactorial and may include advancements in supportive
care of critically ill hospitalized patients, as well as the de￾velopment of less toxic formulations of Amphotericin B, allowing
more patients to complete therapy [24]. Another possibility is the
impact of IDSA treatment guidelines in the US, including
aggressive CSF pressure management, which has helped to
standardize treatment and promote evidence based practices
[25]. However, in-hospital mortality was found to be higher in
HIV-uninfected individuals, which confirms a national trend
previously reported in more focused studies [16,26]. While this
difference could be due to increased admissions of HIV patients
relative to non-HIV infected patients, HIV- uninfected patients
with CM may represent a cohort of patients with more
comorbidities such as malignancies and organ transplants that
may reduce success.
Our study estimated the frequency of co-morbidities for CM￾associated hospitalizations of HIV-uninfected patients in the most
recent two years that data was available (2008–2009). Co￾morbidities disproportionately represented among HIV-uninfected
CM patients (Table 1) included conditions which are known to be
associated with cryptococcosis such as hematologic malignancies,
rheumatologic diseases, renal failure, solid organ transplants,
sarcoidosis and other immune deficiencies, particularly those
associated with cellular immune defects [27], lending support for
our methodology. While many of these co-morbidities may have
predisposed patients to cryptococcosis, others, such as renal
failure, may be consequences of anti-cryptococcal treatments
requiring renal toxic drugs such as Amphotericin B or the result of
the disease itself, such as hydrocephalus [28]. Interestingly, we
found an association with multiple codes indicative of liver disease
including viral hepatitis, liver failure and cirrhosis. Recently, liver
disease has been associated with CM in a retrospective study [29]
as well as liver insufficiency [9] and has been associated with poor
outcome in C. gattii disease [30]. This association could be due to
the use of concomitant hepatotoxic drugs during hospitalization
although reductions in serum complement often observed in liver
disease [31] are important in resistance to CM in animal models
[32], thus suggesting avenues for future study. In addition, while
a number of T cell defects (T cell defect, leukopenia) was strongly
associated with CM, which has been correlated with susceptibility
to CM [33], other defects such as hypogammaglobulinemia were
also highly associated. While this association could represent
coding ambiguities or accompanying defects in cellular immunity,
previous studies in humans and animals have shown associations
of antibody levels and susceptibility to cryptococcosis [34–35], thus
again, suggesting possible future studies focusing on this question.
The present studies also found that CM is associated with
a significant financial burden with HIV-uninfected patients having
a greater cost than HIV-infected patients. This relationship was
found previously in a study using the Maryland Hospitalization
Discharge Data Set (MDHDDS) conducted in 1997 [36]. In
addition, hospitalization costs were found to vary in different
regions of the country in accordance with regional differences in
Medicare reimbursements as recorded by the center for medical
services and reported on the Dartmouth Atlas (www.
dartmouthatlas.org) which could be due to regional differences
in referral patterns or rates of intensive care utilization [37].
Higher costs in the HIV-uninfected patients could also be due to
co-morbidities requiring chemotherapy or transplant conditioning.
Another possibility may be the longer four to six week duration of
intravenous amphotericin B therapy required in this population,
which could lead to longer hospitalizations and higher costs related
to amphotericin B infusion toxicity [25].
Large administrative databases such as the SID offer unique
opportunities to develop nationally representative estimates of
infections among hospitalized patients that can complement more
detailed single center studies [9]. This approach is particularly
important for the study of rare diseases, for which other
approaches are not feasible or cost effective. Nonetheless, these
approaches do have some limitations. Diagnoses derived from
ICD9 codes could be misclassified as they are often abstracted
from charts and may be biased by billing concerns. Misclassifica￾tion using codes is likely to be greatest for diseases that are
challenging to diagnose or require empiric therapy often without
microbiological diagnoses [38,39]. However, a diagnosis of CM is
typically made from a sterile cerebrospinal sample with the aid of
a highly specific and sensitive serum or CSF antigen test [40].
Interestingly, in a recent validation study of ICD-9 codes, while
CM was not specifically tested, other meningitidies with a similar
microbiological diagnostic algorithm such as meningococcal and
pneumoncoccal meningitis were found to have positive predictive
values of in excess of 98% [13]. Thus, coding for CM is likely to be
highly specific but with low sensitivity, such that the trends and
associations observed are likely to be real, although the absolute
disease burden is likely underestimated. Undercoding may also be
due to clinical diagnostic delays which are especially common in
the immunecompetent CM patients [41]. A second limitation was
that our study focused on meningitis caused by Cryptococcus, such
that we have not included in our incidence estimates of other
manifestations of cryptococcosis such as lung, bone or localized
skin disease which may be particularly true of infections due to C.
gattii which have high rates of lung disease without meningitis (29).
Restrictions in the study to 18 states due to lack of continuous
reporting in the remainder may have influenced overall estimated
prevalence estimates if there were unrecognized large deviations in
prevalence throughout the U.S. Finally, because such data
represent hospital discharges rather than individually-identified

patients [14], we are unable to identify how many unique
hospitalizations may be from the same individual.
In summary, these studies show the persistence of cryptococcosis
in the post-ART era, with an increasing burden of the disease in
HIV-uninfected individuals. While the overall incidence of
cryptococcosis is decreasing, the epidemiology is complex and
changing and it remains an important threat, especially in the
HIV-uninfected, emphasizing a continued need for more effective
control and treatment strategies in the U.S.
