 We report a case of combined off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting (OPCAB) and living-donor liver transplantation (LDLT). 
Patient was admitted to undergo liver transplantation due to Child C cirrhosis secondary to hepatitis B infection, and incidentally, 
his preoperative cardiac evaluation revealed silent ischemia due to the two-vessel coronary artery disease (CAD). Patient underwent 
OPCAB followed by LDLT. There was no perioperative cardiovascular event during the days of hospitalization. From the successful 
anesthetic experience of a combined OPCAB and LDLT, we cautiously suggest that a combined OPCAB and LDLT could be a surgical 
treatment for the patients with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) and advanced CAD. (Korean J Anesthesiol 2009; 57: 108∼12)
Key Words: Coronary artery disease, Liver transplantation, OPCAB.
 The advancement of surgical techniques together with the 
change of social prejudice about organ donation has made the 
liver transplantation expand its indication. As a result, the 
number of liver transplantation as a surgical treatment of 
end-stage liver disease is increasing recently. More and more 
patients can live longer and better life with the help of liver
transplantation while postoperative complications and combined 
cardiovascular risks are challenges to both patients and clini￾cians. Especially, liver transplantation in the patients with coro￾nary artery disease (CAD) is considered as a very high-risk 
procedure. Currently, only a limited number of case reports 
about liver transplantation in the patients with CAD and com￾bined coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and living donor 
liver transplantation (LDLT) are available. In this case, we report 
a case of combined off-pump coronary artery grafting (OPCAB) 
and living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) at our hospital.
CASE REPORT
 Fifty-six years-old male patient (body weight 60.7-kg, height
167-cm) was admitted for elective LDLT. He suffered from 
Child-Turcotte-Pugh C cirrhosis secondary to hepatitis B in￾fection. His present illness revealed diabetes mellitus diagnosed 
one year ago and was well managed with sulfonylurea. He 
had a three-year history of recurrent hematemesis secondary to 
esophageal varices and the last variceal ligation was performed
one month ago. His model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) 
score was 23 points from preoperative laboratory data (Table 
1). No active lung disease was identified in his chest X-ray 
but moderate restrictive lung disease pattern with forced vital
capacity 2.03 L (50% of predicted value) was revealed in pul￾monary function tests. He had no history of chest pain or 
dyspnea. His arterial blood gas analysis showed PaO2 58.3 
mmHg under room air. He had overly distended abdomen sug￾gesting large amount of ascites. Unexpectedly, his electrocar￾diography (ECG) revealed anterior infarction and preoperative 
echocardiography showed left ventricular ejection fraction 50% 
and regional wall motion abnormalities like thinning of mid to 
inferior septum and apex of left ventricle in four-chamber view
and severe hypokinesia of inferior, anterior, and anteroseptal 
left ventricular walls in transgastric view in addition to mild

tricuspid regurgitation and diastolic dysfunction grade two with 
left atrial enlargement. Coronary angiography revealed two-ves￾sel disease with totally occluded left anterior descending artery 
(LAD) and right coronary artery (RCA) (Fig. 1). Cardiac en￾zymes were within normal ranges. He was diagnosed with si￾lent myocardial ischemia and CABG was recommended. 
Combined OPCAB-LDLT was decided after multidisciplinary 
discussion about possible perioperative cardiovascular risks. 
 In the operating room, patient was identified and monitored 
with pulse oxymeter, noninvasive blood pressure, and 5-lead 
ECG (II, V5). General anesthesia was induced using etomidate 
20 mg and vecuronium 10 mg and maintained with sevo￾flurane in oxygen-medical air mixture (1 L/min each). Incre￾mental doses of ephedrine 5 mg were administered due to hy￾potension (systolic blood pressure below 70 mmHg) immedi￾ately after induction. After invasive arterial and venous cannu￾lation (right radial artery, femoral artery, and femoral vein), a 
Swan-Ganz catheter (Edwards lifesciences, Irvine, CA, USA) 
was inserted through 9-Fr Advanced Venous Access catheter 
(Edwards lifesciences, Irvine, CA, USA) placed in right in￾ternal jugular vein for hemodynamic monitoring and blood 
sampling. Two units of fresh frozen plasma were administered 
as a preemptive step to decrease the risk of variceal bleeding 
(patient’s PT was 1.77 INR) and transesophageal echocardiog￾raphy (TEE) probe was inserted cautiously in order not to tear 
his esophageal variceal lesions. There was no color change in

nasogastric drainage tube drainage after TEE insertion. We started 
to infuse dopamine (3 μg/kg/min) and nitroglycerine (0.5 μg/ 
kg/min) intravenously. 
 OPCAB was started with median sternotomy. Left internal 
mammary artery and left great saphenous vein grafts were si￾multaneously harvested for grafting. During the harvesting, 
TEE findings were not so different from preoperative results. 
His left ventricular ejection fraction was estimated to be 42% 
by modified Simpson’s method with severe hypokinesia. To as￾sist patient’s heart function, we elevated the rate of dopamine
infusion to 5 μg/kg/min. Cardiac output and pulmonary capil￾lary wedge pressure (PCWP) measured by pulmonary artery 
catheter were 8.4 L/min and 10 mmHg, respectively. Heparin 
30 mg was injected before main bypass grafting and activated 
clotting time checked 5 minutes after heparin injection was 
292 seconds. End-to-side anastomosis of left internal mammary 
artery to LAD, end-to-side anastomosis of left great saphenous 
vein to RCA, and end-to-side anastomosis of left great saphe￾nous vein to ascending aorta under partial clamping of aorta 
were performed sequentially. At the end of main procedure, 
heparin effect was reversed with 30 mg of protamine. After 
bleeding control, chest tube was inserted to patient’s media￾stinum and sternum was wired without skin closure. Subse￾quent TEE showed slightly improved regional wall motion in 
anterior and inferior walls. 
 LDLT began with upper abdominal incision and we changed 
inhalation agent from sevoflurane to desflurane after the appli￾cation of abdominal retractor. We choose 0.9% normal saline 
as a main fluid and its rate was adjusted by mixed venous 
oxygen saturation and hemodynamic parameters including TEE, 
central venous pressure (CVP), PCWP, and right ventricular 
end-diastolic volume. After the removal of large amount of as￾cites (2,100 ml), we noticed yellow staining of intra-abdominal
organs suggesting bile leakage and Cell-Saver was stopped 
thereafter. 
 During the anhepatic phase, a porto-caval shunt was created 
to mitigate hemodynamic instability until the beginning of por￾tal vein anastomosis. Partial clamping of inferior vena cava for 
an anastomosis of graft liver to recipient’s vasculature raised
femoral venous pressure up to 33 mmHg. Transient hypo￾tension was normalized after adjustment for the extent of 
clamping and fluid loading with 500 ml of hetastarch and 
1,300 ml of 0.9% normal saline during the time without liver.
 Immediately before the reperfusion, while suturing posterior 
wall of portal vein, inhalation anesthetic agent was stopped 
and FiO2 was increased to 1.0. Dopamine was infused con￾tinuously at a rate of 5 μg/kg/min and emergency medications 
such as bolus epinephrine and atropine were prepared. During 
the reperfusion, cardiac functions were continuously monitored 
with TEE and leftward deviation of interatrial septum and 
large amount of microbubbles were observed. The shape of left 
ventricle was deformed slightly to D-shape suggesting right 
ventricular volume loading. Systolic blood pressure was drop￾ped to about 60 mmHg and 20 μg epinephrine followed by 
30 μg was immediately injected to restore blood pressure. 
There was no change in his ECG and heart rate did not 
change significantly. After five minutes, vital signs were all 
stabilized and TEE showed minimal tricuspid regurgitation and 
moderate hypokinesis of anterior, inferior, and inferoseptal left 
ventricular walls. 
 Total operation time was 11.5 h. Cold and warm liver is￾chemic times were 88 and 23 minutes, respectively. Total 
amount of infused fluid and blood components were: normal 
saline 10,897 ml, hydroxyethylstarch 1,500 ml, 5% dextrose 
150 ml, 8 leukocyte-depleted red blood cell units (2 units dur￾ing OPCAB and 6 during LDLT), 4 fresh frozen plasma units 
(2 units during induction and 2 units during LDLT) and 1 unit 
of platelet obtained by plateletpheresis. Cell saver blood 235
ml was re-infused to the patient during OPCAB. The amount 
of chest tube drainage was 420 ml of bloody fluid, and total 
urine output was 332 ml averaging about 30 ml/h. Estimated 
blood loss was 4,500 ml. The laboratory and hemodynamic da￾ta as the course of procedures were summarized in Table 2.
 Patient was transferred to intensive care unit postoperatively 
and was extubated on the next day. Vital signs were all stable 
without inotropic support and pulmonary artery catheter was 
removed on the second postoperative day. There were patent 
vascular and biliary structures in abdominal sonography and no 
remarkable ECG and echocardiographic changes comparing to 
preoperative data on fifth postoperative day. Elevated cardiac 
enzymes immediate postoperative period were normalized on 
the next postoperative day. Postoperative urine output was 
maintained at a rate of 100 ml/hr. After eight ICU days, he 
was transferred to general ward and was discharged on the 
54th postoperative day without any cardiovascular complication.

liver transplantation because high perioperative mortality and

morbidity are expected [1], we could find several reports about
successful outcomes of staged or combined CABG and liver 
transplantation [2,3]. After advanced 2-vessel CAD was de￾tected in this patient, we should decide whether or not to pro￾ceed with liver transplantation and make priority-based choices
related to the technical issues. Our patient had totally occluded 
coronary anatomy and he was not suitable for percutaneous 
revascularization. In such case of advanced CAD, the patient 
was deemed not to endure dramatic hemodynamic and meta￾bolic changes during liver transplantation. Although there were
several reports about successful anesthetic and surgical experi￾ence with various methods, OPCAB technique requires less 
heparin and was thought to be more physiologic procedure 
than conventional CABG procedures using cardiopulmonary by￾pass pump and full heparinization. Therefore, OPCAB was 
planned prior to LDLT.
 There were several anesthetic and surgical considerations 
intraoperatively. First, we should regulate appropriate anti￾coagulation status during OPCAB. Although the usually re￾quired dose of heparin is 1.5 mg/kg, we reduced the dose to 
0.5 mg/kg (30 mg) in our patient because preoperative coagul￾opathy in patients with end stage liver disease could result in
over derangement of coagulation even with the recommended 
dose of heparin. Although visual inspection of mediastinal 
structures can give many information to anesthesiologists about
the causes of acute hemodynamic instability and on-site estima￾tion of blood coagulation status [4], sternum was closed by 
metal wire without skin closure to prevent possible media￾stinitis that was possible if there was spillage of contaminated 
bile or spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. Second, we should 
find the surgical modification for hemodynamic stability. With 
the extensively developed collateral vessels in patients with 
ESLD and modified surgical techniques like piggy-back proce￾dure, acute hemodynamic changes do not occur frequently in 
anhepatic phase. However, patients with ischemic heart disease 
secondary to CAD usually have limited cardiac reserves and 
even subtle hemodynamic derangements can precipitate severe 
intraoperative complications. Therefore, in our patient, a por￾to-caval shunt was created to preserve certain amount of pre￾load from portal blood flow during anhepatic phase. Third, in 
addition to routine monitoring procedures in liver trans￾plantation at out hospital, we used TEE in this patient. Real 
time updating by direct visualization was the most useful merit
of TEE during critical period such as reperfusion phase and it 
can detect regional wall dysfunctions from the dynamic rather 
than pressure changes [5,6]. However, TEE monitoring requires 
experienced hands in addition to the risks of orogastric injury, 
variceal bleeding, and recurrent laryngeal nerve damage. In this 
patient, we infused 2 units of fresh frozen plasma before in￾sertion of TEE because preoperative laboratory data showed 
thrombocytopenia. TEE findings were monitored throughout the 
operation and very useful information about cardiac functions

especially during reperfusion phase could be obtained. Direct 
visualization of heart function and volume status guided us to 
manage patient’s hemodymics appropriately. 
 In conclusion, we cautiously suggest that combined OPCAB￾LDLT can be a surgical option for the patients with ESLD 
and high-risk CAD. However, clinical outcomes of the com￾bined procedures are remained yet to be evaluated.
