1. Introduction
First successful kidney transplantation was done over 60 years ago and now because of
major advances in immunosuppressive medicine, this represents the treatment of choice
for patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The kidney was the first organ to be
transplanted regularly, and it remains the most common organ transplanted today but
the surgical technique has changed very little from the original pelvic operation during
this long period.
In most cases kidney is placed retroperitoneally and the iliac arteries and veins are used for
perfusion of this organ and the ureter is transplanted directly to the bladder. But the sophis‐
ticated intensive care units and advanced perioperative anesthetic techniques lead to the use
of more marginal donors for more complicated recipients. Now using a kidney graft from a
donor after cardiac death or proceeding to kidney transplantation as a part of multivisceral or
other abdominal organ transplantation is a routine procedure in the major transplant centers
of the world. In such conditions the kidney grafts are not harvested in an optimized preoper‐
ative planning and may be damaged during the surgery. Then we may confront with a graft
with 2 or more delicate or very short arteries or veins, ruptured capsule or transected ureter.
We may use grafts with congenital anomalies such as horseshoe kidneys or duplicated ureteral
system. Also the recipient procedure may be her or his second, third or more transplantation
surgery and no more iliac vessels remained for anastomosis and the bladder may be so
damaged that makes the anastomosis of the ureter to the bladder impossible. The transplant
surgeon should always be ready to conquer such challenges. Using an intraperitoneal space,
using the aorta or inferior vena cava or other major arteries and veins such as splenic vessels,
and the native ureters for reconstruction of the urine outflow should be an in-hand procedure
for every transplant surgeon.

In this chapter we will review basic steps of the standard approach to recipient’s procedure
from preparing the graft, then the skin incision till the skin closure with special attention to
basic vascular and urinary tract re-establishment techniques and also intraoperative care of
the patient. Then we proceed to the special and unusual situations including: complex vascular
and ureteral reconstruction techniques, using kidneys with congenital and other anatomical
anomalies, en bloc double kidney transplantation, using other vasculature for transplanting
the kidney in different intraperitoneal spaces, and kidney transplantation conjoint with other
abdominal organs.
2. Graft preparation
Preservation of the viability of the graft during the time between explantation and implantation
is vital for early and late graft function after transplantation. Most kidney transplant teams
consist of at least two separate groups. One group prepares the donor and the other team is
doing the recipient operation at the same time or with some delay depending on the duration
needs for transferring the graft from the donor operating room to the recipient operation
theatre. In many countries such as the United States or in the Euro Zone the kidney grafts from
the deceased donors are transferred between hospitals, cities or even countries according to
the Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) matching or other important criteria for attributing the
graft to a preferred recipient. In such conditions it’s better to use every effort to improve the
graft longevity. Using better preservation solutions or automatic machine perfusion systems
are among the routine measurements in such conditions which are discussed in other chapters
of this book. The surgeons and coordinators should shorten the ischemic time of the graft as
long as possible and during all of this period the temperature of the graft should be maintained
between 1-4° centigrade to decrease the injury to the graft.
Simple hypothermia is not enough for preserving the viability of the graft and evacuation of the
graft blood and replacing it with a preservation solution is a mandatory step in the graft prepa‐
ration. Graft cold irrigation in the deceased donors is done during the harvesting operation by
irrigation of the clamped aorta and the solution used for this irrigation may be any of the pre￾prepared solutions such as Belzer University of Wisconsin’s (UW), Histidine-Tryptophan-Ke‐
toglutarate (HTK, Bretschneider or Custodiol), Euro-Collins, Celsior or other newer solutions
such as Biolasol® (Dolińska B, et al, 2012)[1]. Table 1 shows the compositions of some of these
solutions. All of the blood should be evacuated from the graft during this phase. In the living do‐
nor, all of the irrigation is done after removing the graft the donor body in an iced cold basin. In
the countries that the living donor still forms over 75% of the donor pool such as China or India,
irrigation of the living donor graft is done by more simple solutions such as lactated Ringer’s
solution and many studies shows that when the total ischemic time is less than 60 minutes (as in
most living donor programs) the long-term graft survival is not impacted significantly by using
these simple solutions comparing with more complex solutions (Prasad GS, et al, 2007)[2]. In
our center we add lidocaine (100 mg/liter), sodium bicarbonate (10 meq/liter) and heparin (5000
IU/liter) to this simple solution. Also, we use intravenous Mannitol and Furosemide in the do‐
nor just before the arterial clamping for better diuresis before nephrectomy.

When possible, the donor team should report the detailed graft anatomy (including number
of arteries, veins and ureters and any anatomical anomaly or inadvertent injury to the graft
during the donor operation) to the recipient team, especially when the graft is transferred from
another hospital locally or regionally. It is very important to prevent any more injury to the
graft and its capsule, vessels or ureter during the back table procedure, especially in case of
deceased donor grafts which usually accompanied with other abdominal organs or at least
covered by the peritoneum or peri-renal fats or other non-important tissues. Direct contact of
the ice with the graft should be prevented by inserting the graft in a separate basin or organ
bag filled with a cold solution and then inserting this bag in another iced filled basin.
First of all, for irrigation of the living donor graft, the surgeon should find the artery and
canulate it with an atraumatic olive-headed heparin irrigation needle as shown in figure 1.
Using other devices such as Angiocath©, Baranule© or any types of intravenous needles for

irrigation should be discouraged because of risk of intimal injury induced by such cannulas.
In many cases, it may be difficult to find the artery first because it is hidden by other hilar
tissues or retracted to the deeper hilar areas of the graft. In such conditions the irrigation may
be started by canulation the more accessible renal vein, till the surgeon finds the artery. All the
dissections should better be done after complete irrigation. At this point all of the renal
parenchyma will appear in yellow-pink color. All of the dissections should be done delicately
by using atraumatic or microvascular instruments, without any more injury to the vessels
intima or their major branches and any more unusual traction of the vessel wall.

When using the left kidney of the living donor the adrenal and gonadal vein should be on the
graft in order to have a longer vein for future anastomosis. In both right or left kidneys or living
donor or deceased donor grafts, the surgeon should make every effort to preserve the con‐
nective tissues between the ureter and the gonadal vein to prevent ischemic injury to the
delicate collateral vessels of the ureter. Always the ureter should be accompanied by at least
one centimeter of the peri-ureteral tissues and also the hilar inferior triangle (e.g. the window
between the inferior pole of the graft and the ureteral origin from the renal pelvis) should be
maintained intact. Removing peri-renal fat or other tissues should be postponed till complete
renal revascularization. These tissues are protective for handling of the graft and might be used
for graft covering or anchoring during or after revascularization.
The window between the renal artery and vein in the renal hilum is full of accessory branches
and lymphatic vessel. All of the major arterial branches especially of the inferior pole should be
maintained intact. Any injury to this branches leads to regional ischemia or necrosis of the kid‐
ney or ureter which may lead to future graft dysfunction or ischemia – induced hypertension in
the donor or ureteral necrosis, ureteral anastomosis disruption or urine leakage. Some surgeons
170 Current Issues and Future Direction in Kidney Transplantation

suggest that all of the major lymphatic vessels should be ligated to prevent future lymphocele,
however, the most important measurement for preventing the lymphocele is avoiding exces‐
sive dissections around the iliac artery during the preparing the implantation site.
The best approach for prevention of arterial branch injury is to start with dissection of the renal
vein and follow its wall through the hilum until sufficient length is achieved by ligating the
minor veins. We suture-ligate the accessory minor vein branches and also the major lumbar
veins by 6-0 Prolene suture for prevention of postoperative bleeding from hilar vessels.
If the graft has more than one artery, vein or ureter, the surgeon should decide which type of re‐
construction is suitable according to the condition of the graft and the recipient. In the deceased
donor it’s better to use a Carrel patch of aorta and inferior vena cava in line with the graft ves‐
sels. But this has two major impacts on future graft implantation. First, this results in a longer
than usual artery (especially in the right side) or vein (especially in the left side) which may be
results in kinking (and future thrombosis or hypertension) after the anastomosis. And second, it
will results in a large Carrel patch in some cases. The surgeon has to remove a large patch from
the recipient’s vessels for a good anastomosis. If complicated by graft non-function, then future
removal of the graft will result in a large defect of the recipient vessels which will be dangerous
or even limb life threatening. Also, the Carrel patch of the aorta may be severely atherosclerotic
and could not be used for a safe anastomosis. Any reconstruction will elongate the total ische‐
mic time of the graft, and we should do every effort to prevent this by postponing unnecessary
dissections and reconstructions to the time after at least partial reperfusion of the graft.
According to these important issues, when possible, we prefer to use no reconstruction prior
to implantation to decrease the ischemic time. Every transplant surgeon should be fully trained
and familiar with microvascular techniques in such conditions. Every arterial branch should
be anastomosed separately. The major artery is anastomosed first usually to the internal iliac
artery, which provides a longer arterial conduit and allow more free movements of the graft
for venous anastomosis. Smaller arteries are anastomosed after reperfusion of the graft to the
external iliac artery or even to the smaller arteries such as inferior epigastric artery (El-Sherbiny
M, et al, 2008)[3]. When all arterial branches have the same size, then reperfusion is postponed
till the end of anastomosis of all of the arterial branches usually to the external iliac artery but
if the kidney has a large artery and some other smaller arteries then reperfusion is started after
completion of the large artery anastomosis. Arteries less than 1 mm could be ligated specially
in the upper pole. Also ligation of the arteries with resultant ischemic area of less than 15% of
the upper or middle pole is acceptable and by reducing the total operation duration will reduce
the complications in the recipient comparing with adding a long microvascular anastomosis
to the operation. Arteries larger than 1 mm in the lower pole should be reperfused by anasto‐
mosis if possible to prevent ischemia of the ureter.
If the surgeon decides to reconstruct the arteries before implantation then multiple varieties
of techniques could be used: side to side anastomosis of the same size arteries or end to side
anastomosis of a small artery to a larger artery. Using microvascular techniques with a good
illumination and at least 4.5X magnification and 7-0 or 8-0 Prolene sutures, all of the ties should
be placed out of the intimal surface and the lumen should be protected by a smooth metal
probe to prevent inadvertent back-wall suturing. In the deceased donor, the surgeon can use

freely every small bifurcated or trifurcated donor artery (such as the celiac artery) for these
delicate reconstructions. In such complex situations such as severe atherosclerosis of the renal
artery orifice when eversion endarterectomy is not possible (Nghiem DD, Choi SS, 1992) [4]
or results in a damaged artery, the best approach for salvage of the graft is transecting the
diseased part of the renal artery and using a small branch of the donor artery such as the left
gastric or splenic artery as an elongation conduit of the renal artery. In the case of living donors,
a short segment of the recipient saphenous vein may be a good choice for this purpose but it
has a real risk of future aneurismal transformation in the future (Sharma A, et al, 2010) [5].
Sometimes we could use a combination of these techniques. For example when the graft has
2 large-size and 1 small-size artery, the best option is to perform an anastomosis between the
small-size artery and one of the larger size branches and then perform two separate anasto‐
moses in the recipient. This action will reduce the total operative time of the recipient.
Approach to the vein branches is a little different because of intra-parenchymal communica‐
tions between the vein branches. We could ligate non-major venous branches, but when the
vein branches are in the same size we should reconstruct them before venous anastomosis.
Some surgeons prefer to mobilize the external iliac vein by ligating the internal iliac vein or
superior gluteal vein or other side branches of this vein, but usually these maneuvers are futile
in providing better window for venous anastomosis especially when we use the right kidney
from a living donor. In such conditions we prefer to perform the venous anastomosis first or
placing the graft in an upside down direction (ureter in the upper part) (Webb J et al, 2003) [6].
In the deceased donor, using a part of the donor external iliac, internal jugular or inferior vena
cava as an extension graft is more preferable for adding the length of the vein graft. Such
reconstructions should be done in the back table prior to implantation.
In our opinion, ureteral reconstruction also should be discouraged in case of multiple graft
ureters. When the ureters have insufficient length, or denuded in their entire length, mobili‐
zation of the recipient bladder or using of the recipient ureter is preferred.
At the end of graft preparation some authors suggest that the graft should be wrapped in iced
or cold saline soaked surgical gauzes or cloth stockinet or surgical glove to remain cold
throughout the implantation procedure. In our opinion this is a time consuming and fruitless
maneuver when the surgeons could do the anastomoses rapidly. Also using the ice packets in
the site of implantation is not necessary.
3. Implantation site
So many factors impact the surgeon’s decision on which site he could implant the kidney graft
(table 2). These factors include: the graft size comparing with the recipient, the size, length and
number of graft arteries, veins and/or ureters, previous surgeries (for example previous failed
kidney transplantation, previous pelvic exploration for bladder reconstruction or anti-reflux
surgeries), associated abdominal organ (liver, pancreas or small bowel) transplantation, lateral‐
ity of the donor kidney (left or right), anomalies of the donor graft (horseshoe kidney, double
pelvis, double ureter, etc.), and at last the number of kidney grafts (double kidney from a pedia‐

tric or old age or marginal donor). Traditionally the right iliac fossa is the standard fossa for a
kidney transplantation procedure and the left iliac fossa is the preferred site for simultaneous
kidney-pancreas transplantation. In the pediatric recipient when the graft is larger than usual
we should use the main abdominal fossa for implantation. The most important limiting factor
for each of these procedures is the length of the renal vein and also the length of the donor ureter
and mobility of the recipient urinary bladder. In most instances when the recipient internal iliac
artery is used as the arterial inflow, it provides a good length for mobilization and would not be
a limiting factor. The right iliac fossa is the preferred site because of the more superficial posi‐
tion of the external iliac vein. The deep branches of the iliac vein can be suture ligated and cut if
more superficialization is needed. If the recipient ureter is not diseased it can be used for urinary
outflow reconstruction if the donor ureter is short.

4. Skin preparation and incision
Skin preparation and drape is not so different from other clean abdominal operations. The
patient should bathe before entering the operation theatre. Hair removal is better done with

173

hair clippers immediately before surgery. We use scrub povidone iodine or any types of
alcoholic or polyethylene glycol type solutions (e.g. Decocept®) for initial washing and then
normal povidone iodine for 2 times for the final preparation. Also we use a sterile (Opsite®)
drape for complete covering of the incision region. The standard skin incision is the traditional
hockey-stick Gibson incision or an oblique Rutherford Morison in the right iliac fossa. Gibson
incision starts at the tubercule of pubis and continued laterally transverse to inguinal ligament
and then upward in a curvilinear manner in the lateral border of the rectus abdominis muscle
till 1-2 cm above the level of umbilicus. In larger adults extension till the anterior superior iliac
spine may be enough. The epigastric vessels and the round ligament in females usually need
to be ligated and transected, but the spermatic cord simply retracted medially by releasing the
border of inguinal canal. The surgeon should avoid entering the peritoneal space and any
defect in the peritoneum should be repaired before continuing the incision.
All the dissections should be accompanied by strict hemostasis and avoiding extreme injury
to the abdominal wall muscles to simplify the future abdominal wall repair at the end of the
procedure. All the bleeding sites should be completely hemostatized during this time because
at the end of the procedure hemostasis will be very difficult. Also most renal failure patients
has bleeding tendency due to platelet dysfunction specially in the first 2 hours after the
hemodialysis or in those patient who underwent preemptive renal transplantation. If hemo‐
stasis is not complete wound or peri-graft hematoma is inevitable which will lead to the other
complications such as infection, dehiscence, hydronephrosis or kidney compartment syn‐
drome due to compression to the graft.
After entering the retroperitoneal space and revealing the anatomy of the iliac vessels and their
suitability for transplantation, the iliac vein should be prepared first by ligating all lymphatics
around it. It’s better to avoid the first major deep iliac lymph node (Cloquet’s node). Dissections
around the external iliac artery should be limited and if the internal iliac artery has a good con‐
tour and length, it’s better to use it as the arterial inflow. If this artery has atherosclerotic plaques
an endarterectomy could be done. We use the external iliac artery only when the internal iliac ar‐
tery of the other side is used previously, or when a large size discrepancy is revealed or severe
atherosclerosis reduce the arterial flow to a very low and crucial level. Using the internal iliac ar‐
tery slightly increases the postoperative lymphocele because of more dissections needed for its
releasing, but if the surgeon ligate all the lymphatics it would not be a major problem.
Without a good exposure, transplantation is a very difficult procedure and using a, Denis￾Browne (Figure 2), Kirschner(Figure 3) or Bookwalter-type (Figure 4) self retaining retractor is a
critical step in the implantation procedure. Many manufacturers have invented more powerful
retractors. Some of them like Thompson® retractor, although are very useful and unique for liv‐
er or kidney-pancreas transplantation, but their use for kidney transplantation alone is time
consuming and is best limited to super-obese recipients. Some of them such as Henley or Dar‐
ling or Gosset abdominal retractor only are useful in pediatric or thin patients with a shallow
pelvis. Balfour and Balfour-Baby, Collin and Baby Collin, Ricard and Sullivan- O’Connor have
the same problem. Some of them such as Omni-Flex® (Omni-Tract® surgical, Minnesota Scien‐
tific, MN, USA) or SynFrame® retractor systems (Synthes® Spine Inc., PA, USA) are modifica‐
tions to the original Thompson retractor but their use may be more sophisticated.

5. Vascular anastomosis
After preparation of the place of the implantation, the surgeon should transfer the graft
to its position transiently for better evaluation of the anastomoses sites. Some authors
suggest that slush ice should put in the bed of the graft in the recipient, but we abso‐
lutely disagree with this opinion, because the total vascular reconstruction time is usual‐
ly less than 20 minutes and adding ice only increase the risk of local hypothermic injury.
The surgeon should do his best efforts to reduce the total arterial and venous clamping
time. First the site of each anastomosis and the position of the graft should be specified
accurately according to the size and length of the vessels and also the length of the ure‐
ter and position of the recipient bladder or ureter and the final position of the implanted
kidney. As described previously, we prefer to use the internal iliac artery and external
iliac vein for vascular anastomoses. For reducing the vein clamping time (with subse‐
quent risk of deep vein thrombosis), we perform the arterial anastomosis first. But when
the vein is shorter than usual or when the left iliac fossa is used for implantation, or
when the abdominal cavity and aorta and inferior vena cava or the external iliac artery
are used for implantation, it’s better to perform the venous anastomosis first.
The principles of vascular anastomosis are not different from any standard vascular surgery.
The best suture size is usually 5-0 and 6-0 Prolene® sutures for venous and arterial anasto‐
mosis. The size of the needles depends of the location of the anastomosis but in most cases the
needle should be taper-point or taper-cutting-tip round-bodied 3/8 circle with 11 – 13 mm
length for better performance. For smaller arteries 7-0 or 8-0, 1/2 circle, 7-9.3 mm needles may
be more suitable. For severe atherosclerotic arteries use of special visible Ethicon Visi-Black®
Everpoint®, or Tapercut® needles with spatulated heads which is more firm and crash￾resistant is needed.
After confirming the exact length and position of the anastomosis site to prevent kinking or
rotation, vascular clamps are applied to the first vessel. We prefer to use Bulldog clamps to
the internal iliac artery and iliac veins and Satinsky clamps for side-clamping of external iliac
and common iliac artery or aorta or inferior vena cava. We discourage systemic heparinization
before clamping because of bleeding tendency in chronic renal failure patients, but other
authors recommend this. Heparinized saline is enough for irrigation of the vessels during the
anastomosis.
For end-to-side anastomoses a patch from the vessel should be removed for preventing future
constriction. This patch is removed from the arteries by No. 3, 4 or 5 aortic punches depending
on the arterial size and by special Metzenbaum or Potts scissors from the veins. Also we should
avoid the venous valve site in the external iliac vein, if possible. The wall of the vein is very
thin proximal to the venous valves (sinuses of Valsalva) and may be ruptured during the
anastomosis.
For end-to side anastomosis of a renal artery to the external iliac or common iliac or aorta, the
graft artery should be spatulated in the direction of its lower corner. For end-to-end anasto‐
mosis of the renal artery to the internal iliac artery, the renal artery should be spatulated from
176 Current Issues and Future Direction in Kidney Transplantation

the upper corner and the internal iliac artery should be spatulated in the direction of the
opposite lower corner (in other words in the direction the deep part of the artery). Renal vein
usually needs no spatulation.
An endarterectomy should be done with extreme caution after cutting the internal iliac artery
or entering the external iliac artery. No intimal flaps in the opposite direction of the blood flow
should be remained at the end of endarterectomy. If such flap is remained, then the surgeon
should decide to change the arterial anastomosis site, if possible, or at least the flap must
completely secured to the arterial wall with a tagging U-stitch.
Special attention should be paid to the length of the right artery and left renal vein of the de‐
ceased donor. They are both too long for anastomosis and if not trimmed or shortened, kinking
will be inevitable which will result in postoperative renal dysfunction and hypertension.
Arterial anastomosis is started by two corner stitch in each side of the vessel as described first by
Carrel in 1902. Care is taken to include equal bites of all layers of the arterial wall in each passage
of the needle and the adventitia remained outside. For this purpose we perform a 1 mm adventi‐
tiectomy of both arteries and use microvascular forceps, scissors and needle holders for arterial
anastomosis and also recommend using a 4.5-6X loop for magnification and surgical headlights
for better illumination. It’s so important that the posterior layer suturing of the arterial anasto‐
mosis is done first and from outside. The needle should move from inside to outside of the more
diseased artery (usually the recipient artery) to tag the intima to the media of the artery and pre‐
venting from creating an intimal flap which will be a good trigger point for future thrombosis.
The upper suture is tied but the lower is maintained untied till the end of the anastomosis. The
posterior layer is sutured first and then anterior layer anastomosis is started from both corners.
In the children or for small arteries at least one half of the anastomosis should be done by sepa‐
rate sutures. In all other continuous anastomoses (artery or vein), we tie the last suture loosely
and preserve a “Growth factor” or “expansion factor” to prevent purse-string effect of the con‐
tinuous suture on constricting the anastomosis as first described by Starzl in the portal anasto‐
mosis of liver transplantation (Starzl TE, 1984, Zomorrodi, et al, 2012) [7, 8]) [7].
For vein anastomosis we use a somewhat different technique. After inserting the two corner
stitches, an anchoring or stay suture is used in the midpoint of the anterior layer of the
venotomy site of the external iliac vein to maintain the orifice of the anastomosis site totally
exposed and prevent from inadvertent catching of the posterior suture line in the anterior
suture line. All the anastomosis is performed circumferentially by a single stitch that used as
the proximal corner stitch. Then the surgeon should be cautious when tying this suture that
the two remaining part are in the same length. The anastomosis is started from the proximal
part by entering tying the corner stitch. Then the needle is entered from the posterior layer of
the internal iliac vein into its lumen. Then a four-point technique is used for approximating
the two intimal layers of the renal vein and external iliac vein. After completing the posterior
layer then the anastomosis is continued from distal and proximal corner to the anterior layer
and the anchoring stitch is removed. Again a “Growth factor” is necessary to prevent the purse
string effect and also in the pediatric group, the anterior layer stitches should be in separate
manner for make future growth possible. If the venotomy site is larger than the orifice of the

renal vein, then after completing the posterior layer, the excessive part should be repaired
before starting the anterior layer, preferably by another suture line.
6. Unusual situations
In case of thrombosed or fibrotic external iliac vein (due to multiple previous femoral vein
canulations or previous DVT) or severe atherosclerotic iliac arteries, the best approach is to
use the abdominal major vasculature for renal transplantation. The surgeon may decide to use
the common iliac artery or vein if spared from the disease or close the wound and explore the
opposite iliac fossa if preoperative Investigations or intraoperative sonographywere negative
for the same complication. In extreme cases when the IVC is also thrombosed or fibrotic, or
when the infrarenal aorta also is atretic or severely atherosclerotic, using the splenic or native
renal vein and artery may be an option, provided that the native ureters has a normal function
and anatomy.
Another unusual case is the horseshoe kidney. Anomalous vasculature is the rule in these
cases. Crossed fused or non-fused ectopic kidneys have the same problem. One option for
approaching this type of anomaly is to incise the ismusth between the two conjoined kidneys
and use each kidney for a separate recipient. The major problem is the resultant two grafts
with so many arterial and venous branches and also short and multiple ureters. Because of
shortage of donor organs most centers prefer this approach. But sometimes dividing the
horseshoe kidney is so difficult and may results in damaging both kidneys. In these cases it’s
better to use the anomalous kidney as an individual graft and use the aorta and IVC as the
arterial inflow and venous outflow of the graft. Such large size graft often could not be placed
retroperitoneally and should be implanted in an intraperitoneal space. The same principle is
applied to double kidney grafts from a pediatric or old age or more marginal donors such as
donation after cardiac death (DCD) donors: transplanting each unit separately or using the
aorta and IVC as the vascular conduits of the graft. Circumaortic or retroaortic renal veins are
other problematic vascular anomalies that make the transplantation procedure more difficult.
In experienced hands, these anomalies per se are not contraindication for donation even from
the living donors
When a suspicious lesion is found on the kidney graft, it should be incised or excised and sent
for frozen section pathologic investigation. Hemostasis could be done by sutures or argon
beam coagulators, following the principles of any standard partial nephrectomy. Benign
lesions should be removed completely and grafts with any non-benign pathology should be
discarded. Solitary cysts are very common and if small, needs no investigation. There are many
case reports in the literature about transplanting kidneys from deceased donors with adult
polycystic kidney disease, without any short-term complications. These grafts should only be
used when the donor kidney function is good and the recipient is fully aware of the donor
disease. These cases are best suitable for sedentary recipients with a short life expectancy,
provided that no other contraindication such as HLA mismatch is found.
178 Current Issues and Future Direction in Kidney Transplantation

Kidney transplantation may be accompanied by pancreas, liver (Nadim MK, et al, 2012)[9],
heart (Florman S, Kim-Schluger L.,2012) [10], lung (Rana RK, et al, 2011) [11] or multiorgan
transplantation. In such situations usually the more important transplantation (heart, lung,
liver, pancreas or small bowel) is done first. And after stability of the recipient, kidney
transplantation is performed. Even when the abdomen is entered during the first procedure,
it’s better to use the retroperitoneal iliac fossa for the second transplant by the same incision.
This will reduce the complications associated with urine leakage. In case of simultaneous
kidney –pancreas transplantation the kidney transplant is done first in the left iliac fossa and
during the time of this procedure, the other team prepares the pancreas graft by ex vivo surgery
for the second transplantation which is usually use the right common or external iliac artery
as the inflow. The kidney transplantation combined with multivisceral transplantation is
usually is an en-bloc transplantation. This means that the kidney is not separated from the
donor aorta and inferior vena cava (IVC). All major vascular anastomoses are done by aorta
as the inflow artery and IVC and/or portal vein as the venous outflow. The urinary recon‐
struction is performed after complete reperfusion of all abdominal organs.
7. Declamping and reperfusion
After completing the vascular anastomoses, the opposite corner stay sutures remained untied
until reperfusion. The recipient systolic blood pressure should be at least 120 mmHg and the
central venous pressure between 10 to 14 cm H2O. The use of vasopressors such as dopamine
for increasing the blood pressure is controversial. Immunosuppressant is best infused before
declamping according to the protocols of each transplant ward. Some authors suggests some
over-hydration, infusing Furosemide and Mannitol and correction of acid-base imbalance
according to the last arterial blood gas base deficit before declamping to prevent the so called
“reperfusion syndrome”. Unlike liver or small bowel transplantation, in most cases reperfu‐
sion syndrome will not be a problematic issue, because the kidney graft is relatively small,
except when using an adult kidney for a pediatric recipient or in cases of a long implantation
time with complete aortic or common or external iliac artery clamping time. In such cases the
cause of “reperfusion syndrome” is transient ischemia of the lower limbs. The anesthesiologist
should prepare sodium bicarbonate, calcium gluconate, and insulin with 50% Glucose before
declamping for managing this complication and obtain an arterial blood gas before and after
the declamping for estimating the severity of acidosis and monitor the electrocardiogram for
diagnosis of hyperkalemia.
Arterial declamping is done first and after complete filling of the graft, veins are also opened.
In this phase brisk bleeding is a rule, especially when we applied “growth factors” to the last
ties. Most of the bleeding will be stopped spontaneously after complete dilatation of the
anastomotic lines. Small bleeding sites may be covered by small parts of any hemostatic agent
such as Surgicel®, N-butyl cyanoacrylate glues, Tachosil® or similar agents (Sageshima J, et
al, 2011) [13]. All the other larger bleeding sites should be transligated or repaired by fine
Prolene® sutures especially near the hilum, but extreme caution should be paid not to include
the delicate hilar arterial branches in the sutures.

The kidney should be firm and well-perfused after 1-2 minutes and urine flow usually starts
after that. If the graft is flaccid and the patient’s blood pressure is good, arterial kinking is the
first differential diagnosis. This usually is resolved by repositioning of the graft. Also the
surgeon could transiently clamp the renal vein or the distal part of the external iliac artery. If
not, thrombosis must be considered and ruled out as soon as possible.
8. Urinary reconstruction
After completing the reperfusion stage usually the urine flow is started. Sometimes, especially
in case of deceased donors or when the nephrectomy has been performed with difficulty in
the living donors, the urine flow will be delayed. If the color and contour of the graft look good
and the arterial and venous flow is good with a well-palpable thrill in the hilum, the surgeon
should proceed to urinary reconstruction.
First of all the urinary bladder should be filled with sterile normal saline serum through
previously installed urinary catheter. Some surgeons add 10ml/lit povidone iodine and 80 mg/
lit Gentamicin or 500 mg/lit Amikacin to the irrigation fluid for better sterility of the bladder
(Salehipour M, et al, 2010) [13] but its effect is controversial. The kidney should be positioned
in its final expected place to prevent the tension on the remained ureter before cutting the
excess length of the ureter. It’s better to use the smallest possible length of the ureter to reduce
future ischemic complications. If this step is forgotten the final length of ureter may be shorter
than expected and this will result in kinking of the vasculature and changing the location of
the kidney from its ideal position.
The surgeon has many options for urinary reconstruction: ureteroneocystostomy, ureter‐
oureterostomy, pyeloureterostomy, and pyelocystostomy or even ureteroenterostomy to
an ileal conduit or Koch (Manassero F, et al, 2011) [14] or pyelopyelostomy in case of or‐
thotopic kidney transplantation or complicated case (Wagner M, et al, 1994) [15]. The
type of reconstruction depends on the position of the graft, the length, condition and
number of the donor ureter(s), the condition of the recipient’s bladder or bladder substi‐
tute (including its capacity and continence), previous operations on the recipient bladder
or ureter (and its antireflux condition). The anastomosis should be done by absorbable
sutures, usually polydioxanone sutures. Because of the risk of infection, use of any types
of stents, such as double J stents or newer antireflux stents are controversial (Parapiboon
W, et al, 2012) [16], but we use it in our center and remove it after 3 weeks. At least 4
techniques and their modifications are discussed in the literature for ureteroneocystosto‐
my (Kayler L, et al, 2010) [17]. Prevention of leakage, stricture and reflux is the final goal
of all of these techniques. The two most common types are transvesical or Leadbetter-Po‐
litano (LP) technique and the extravesical or modified Lich-Gregoir (LG) technique. We
use and recommend the second technique because it needs fewer dissections and use on‐
ly one small cystostomy incision (comparing with 2 large cystostomy incision needs for
LP technique) with comparable antireflux characteristics and fewer complications. The
LG technique can be performed in a very shorter time. After distending the bladder, the
180 Current Issues and Future Direction in Kidney Transplantation

detrusor muscle dissected bluntly in the dome of the bladder approximately for a length
of 3 cm till the mucosa bulges out. The ureter shortened to its ideal length and spatulat‐
ed for a length of 2 cm in its anti-mesoureteral direction and then the bladder mucosa
incised. Anastomosis is started near the heel of the spatulated ureter 2-3 mm in the op‐
posite direction of the corner of the ureter. In this manner, the tie is placed outside and
with some distance from the corner. The mucosa of the bladder is then sutured to the
ureteral end with simple continuous sutures. After completing the anastomosis, an ab‐
sorbable suture is used for approximating the detrusor muscle to close over the anasto‐
mosis and creating a small submucosal tunnel for its antireflux mechanism. The LP
techniques and the two other extravesical techniques are better described in the literature
(Kayler L, et al, 2010) [17]. In the LP technique, a large anterior cystostomy is done for
visualization of the bladder interior and the ureter is transferred through another small
posterior cystostomy and then through the mucosa and after anchoring the distal end to
the mucosa, the bladder is closed in 2 layers with absorbable sutures. Another extravesi‐
cal technique is the single or double U-stitch technique. In these techniques after open‐
ing the submucosal tunnel by creating by dissection of detrusor muscle and incising the
bladder mucosa only 1 U-stitch (Shanfield, 1972) [18] at the toe or 2 U-stitch (MacKinnon
et al, 1968) [19] at the toe and heel of the trimmed ureter is used for anchoring the ure‐
ter to bladder mucosa and then the detrussor muscle closed as the same manner of the
LG technique.
Another extravesical technique uses two parallel incisions in the detrusor muscle, first
posterior for transferring the ureter in a submucosal tunnel and the second incision for
anastomosis of the ureter to the ureteral mucosa (Barry JM, 1983) [20]. In the last technique,
the ureter is anastomosed to the bladder full-thickness wall without any antireflux mechanism
(Starzl, et al, 1989) [21]. In our opinion, the surgeon should be familiar with all of these methods
and use them as needed, but we have the most experience with the modified LG technique
without any major urologic complication (Davari HR, et al, 2006) [22].
When the graft ureter is short, ischemic, or denuded, the surgeon should use the native ureters
for ureteroureterostomy or pyeloureterostomy if they are completely in a healthy condition
(no stricture, no infection, no dilation or no reflux) or decide to perform a pyeloneocystostomy.
This should be done with extreme caution to prevent kinking or pressure on the graft vascu‐
lature or repositioning of the graft. A Boari flap or psoas hitch is often necessary in all cases.
In case of previous bladder surgery such as antireflux surgeries or cystoplasty or bladder
augmentation, it’s very important that the site of final urinary reconstruction is fully depicted
before proceeding with vascular anastomosis, or even before proceeding with nephrectomy
in the living donor. Also the blood supply of the tissues used for augmentation should be
considered. Creating a submucosal flap in the augmented bladder may results in ischemia of
the tissues used for augmentation and if possible it’s better to use the native bladder area for
ureteral anastomosis.
In case of double or multiple ureters (such as horseshoe kidneys or en bloc transplantation of
two kidneys), the ureters can be anastomosed separately to the bladder, or one to the bladder
and the shorter ones to the native ureter. Another option is anastomosis of the ureters to each

other and then anastomosis of the conjoined ureter to the bladder. In our opinion using
separate anastomoses (if possible) reduces the future complications.
9. Wound closure
Wound closure is the final step of the procedure. Closing is done by 2-layer repair of the
abdominal muscles (first transverse and internal oblique as one layer and then the external
oblique muscle), by a No. 0 loop Nylon suture. Using any drain before closure is controversial
but if used it should be a closed suction drain such as a Jackson-Pratt drain and every effort
should be used that the drain has no compression effect on the renal vasculature and the ureter.
The exit site also should be assessed for bleeding. Every bleeding site should be assessed and
repaired before closure to prevent postoperative hematoma. Diffuse oozing at the end of
operation may be the result of platelet dysfunction or heparin overdose and should be
managed accordingly by desmopressin and protamine sulfate, respectively. Excess perirenal
fat should be removed, and the graft should be placed in a retroperitoneally created pouch
parallel with the psoas muscle, to prevent compression of the kidney between the abdominal
wall and the pelvic bones. If the kidney volume is greater than this space, or the renal vascu‐
lature or ureter is shorter than usual, then “compartment syndrome” is inevitable is the
abdominal muscles repaired in the usual manner. In such situation, the renal artery inflow is
good but the outflow will be disturbed because of pressure of the abdominal wall on the renal
vein. Renal venous pressure increase and then the graft will be congested and the urine flow
will decreased. If remained unmanaged, this will eventually lead to decreasing renal artery
flow and finally to renal artery thrombosis and graft loss. If the surgeon could not reposition
the graft in to the supravesical area and anchor it to the abdominal wall without vascular
kinking, many other options should be tried. One option is to incise the rectus sheath after
closing the muscles. Another option is to close the abdominal wall from distal and proximal
and let the part which is covering the kidney remains unclosed or closed by an artificial mesh
which is used for hernia repair. The last option is to let abdominal musculature remained
completely opened and only covered by the skin. The resultant incisional hernia will be
repaired in the future, usually 3 months after the transplantation. The best treatment of such
conditions is “prevention” by matching the size of the donor and recipient and special attention
to the length of the graft vasculature and ureter and also creating the pouch as the first step
during the procedure.
