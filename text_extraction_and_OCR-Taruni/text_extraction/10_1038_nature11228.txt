Malnutrition affects up to one billion people in the world and is a
major cause of mortality1,2. In many cases, malnutrition is associated
with diarrhoea and intestinal inflammation, further contributing to
morbidity and death2
. The mechanisms by which unbalanced dietary
nutrients affect intestinal homeostasis are largely unknown. Here we
report that deficiency in murine angiotensin I converting enzyme
(peptidyl-dipeptidase A) 2 (Ace2), which encodes a key regulatory
enzyme of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), results in highly
increased susceptibility to intestinal inflammation induced by epithe￾lial damage. The RAS is known to be involved in acute lung failure3
,
cardiovascular functions4 and SARS infections5
. Mechanistically,
ACE2 has a RAS-independent function, regulating intestinal amino
acid homeostasis, expression of antimicrobial peptides, and the eco￾logy of the gut microbiome. Transplantation of the altered micro￾biota from Ace2 mutant mice into germ-free wild-type hosts was able
to transmit the increased propensity to develop severe colitis. ACE2-
dependent changesin epithelialimmunity and the gut microbiota can
be directly regulated by the dietary amino acid tryptophan. Our
results identify ACE2 as a key regulator of dietary amino acid home￾ostasis, innate immunity, gut microbial ecology, and transmissible
susceptibility to colitis. These results provide a molecular explanation
for how amino acid malnutrition can cause intestinal inflammation
and diarrhoea.
The RAS has now been studied for more than a century. It is regu￾lated by the opposing actions of two key carboxypeptidases, angiotensin
converting enzyme (ACE) and ACE2 (refs 4, 6, 7). In addition to its
catalytic activity, we and others have recently found that ACE2 asso￾ciates with the neutral amino acid transporter B0
AT1 and that ACE2 is
required for expression of this transporter on the luminal surface of
intestinal epithelial cells8,9. Variants in the gene that encodes B0
AT1
(SLC6A19) have been identified as a cause of Hartnup’s disease10, a rare
autosomal recessive disorder associated with pellagra-like symptoms
including diarrhoea that manifests under conditions of malnutrition11.
However, the in vivo function of ACE2 in the gut epithelium remained
to be investigated.
Morphological and ultra-structural analysis of the small and large
intestine of Ace2 knockout mice (see below) did not reveal any altera￾tions. When we challenged such mice with dextran sodium sulphate
(DSS), an irritant that disrupts the intestinal epithelial barrier and
results in colitis12, a profoundly increased inflammatory reaction was
observable compared to wild-type littermates. We detected an
enhanced infiltration of inflammatory cells, significant shortening of
the colon length, increased intestinal bleeding, crypt damage, weight
loss and severe diarrhoea, resulting in an overall increased disease
activity13 (Fig. 1a–c, Supplementary Fig. 1). Similar results were
obtained using trinitrobenzene sulphonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis
(Supplementary Fig. 2). Thus, genetic inactivation of the key RAS
enzyme ACE2 results in severe colitis following intestinal injury. We
note that Ace2 deficiency was investigated in male mice (Ace22/y, the
Ace2 gene being located on the X chromosome) throughout this study,
however, we observed a similar phenotype in female Ace22/2 mice
(not shown).

To test whether the severe colitis phenotype is due to the catalytic
activity of ACE2, we treated mice with recombinant soluble ACE2
(rsACE2). We and others have shown that rsACE2 rescues virtually
all previously reported in vivo ACE2 functions within the RAS sys￾tem3,14. As it lacks the transmembrane domain, soluble ACE2 cannot
associate with the neutral amino acid transporter B0
AT1 and thus
cannot stabilize its cell-surface localization8
. Treatment of mice with
rsACE2 did not rescue the severe DSS-induced colitis phenotype of
Ace2 mutant mice (Supplementary Fig. 3a–h). One in vivo
consequence of Ace2 deletion within the RAS is accumulation of
angiotensin II (ANGII), which then primarily acts on the G-protein￾coupled AT1a receptor (Agtr1a)3
. We indeed observed increased
AngII levels in the colon of DSS-treated Ace2 mutant mice that were
reduced to background levels after treatment with rsACE2 (Supplemen￾tary Fig. 3i). To rule out the possibility that locally increased AngII might
cause severe colitis, we generated Agtr1a2/2Ace22/y mice. Deletion of
Agtr1 did not rescue the severe DSS-induced colitis (Supplementary
Fig. 4), indicating that these effects are independent of the classical RAS
system. In addition to cleaving AngII, ACE2 exhibits catalytic activity
towards a second peptide system, Apelin15. However, DSS-induced
colitis was not altered in mice carrying genetic mutations in Apelin
(Supplementary Fig. 5) or its receptor Apj (Supplementary Fig. 6).
Thus, the catalytic activity of ACE2, essential for its function in the
RAS and Apelin cleavage, has no overt role in DSS-induced intestinal
inflammation.
It had been reported that the RAS can control immune functions16.
However, in unchallenged Ace2 mutant mice, we did not observe any
apparent differences in immune cell populations of the colon and
small intestine (not shown). TLR1–9 mRNA levels in jejunum, ileum,
and colon were largely similar in Ace2 deficient and wild-type mice,
with the exception of TLR5 and TLR9 in the colon (Supplementary
Fig. 7). Transplantation of bone marrow from Ace2 mutant mice
(knock-out, KO) into wild-type (WT) mice (KORWT) did not result
in any obvious effect on DSS-induced colitis as compared toWTRWT
transplant recipients. By contrast, reconstitution of Ace2 mutant mice
with WT bone-marrow (WTRKO) led to an increased severity of
DSS-induced colitis that was indistinguishable from the KORKO
control group (Supplementary Fig. 8). Thus, ACE2 exerts its role on
intestinal inflammation in non-haematopoietic cells.
ACE2 expression was primarily mapped to the luminal surface of
differentiated small intestinal epithelial cells, whereas lower ACE2
expression is observed in crypt cells and the colon (Supplementary
Figs 9a, b and 10a). Ace2 inactivation had no overt effect on basal
proliferation of small intestinal or colon crypt cells (Supplementary
Fig. 10a, b) nor did it affect apoptosis rates of intestinal epithelial cells
(Supplementary Fig. 10a, c). ACE levels were slightly, albeit not sig￾nificantly, increased in the jejunum of Ace22/y mice (Supplementary
Fig. 9c, d). As reported previously8
, protein expression of the neutral
amino acid transporter B0
AT1 was absent in the small intestine ofAce2
mutant mice, whereas mRNA expression was not affected
(Supplementary Figs 9e, f and 11a). Owing to the lack of intestinal
B0
AT1 protein expression, serum levels of the neutral amino acids
valine (Val), threonine (Thr) and tyrosine (Tyr), and the essential
amino acid tryptophan (Trp) were markedly reduced in Ace22/y mice
(Supplementary Fig. 11b). The marked reduction in tryptophan
correlates with human data, as patients suffering from Hartnup’s
disease caused by Slc6a19 mutations or malnutrition such as in
anorexia nervosa exhibit reduced tryptophan serum levels17,18.
ACE2 is a chimaeric protein that emerged from the duplication and
fusion of two genes: it is homologous with ACE at the catalytic domain
and with collectrin (TMEM27) in the membrane proximal domain19.
Inactivation of collectrin in mice (Tmem272/2) results in a near com￾plete downregulation of apical amino acid transporters such as B0
AT1
in the kidney, thereby regulating renal amino acid re-absorption19. By
contrast, ACE2 associates with B0
AT1 on the luminal surface of
intestinal epithelial cells, that is, ACE2 and B0
AT1 regulate the uptake
of neutral amino acids in the intestine where collectrin is not expressed
(Supplementary Figs 11a, c and 12). In both Tmem272/2 and Ace22/y
mutant mice, tryptophan is reduced in the serum (Supplementary
Fig 11b, and ref. 19). To test whether impaired re-absorption of
amino acids in the kidney might also result in altered susceptibility
to colitis, we challenged Tmem272/2 mice with DSS. However,
genetic ablation of Tmem27 did not affect DSS-induced colitis (Sup￾plementary Fig. 13). Although genetic inactivation of both Ace2 or
Tmem27 result in a similar deregulation of amino acids in the serum,
functionally only the loss of ACE2 affects the susceptibility to intestinal
inflammation.
We, therefore, speculated that the function of ACE2 in intestinal
uptake of dietary amino acids might underlie the observed phenotype.
To test this hypothesis, we fed Ace2 mutant and control mice a protein
free-diet (PFD) to eliminate dietary amino acids and challenged these
mice with DSS at a dose (1%) that triggers only very mild colitis. Basal
weight loss was comparable among control and Ace2 mutant mice
during the period of the PFD (Supplementary Fig. 14a). Moreover,
average food intake did not show a significant difference between Ace2
deficient and control mice fed PFD or normal chow (Supplementary
Fig. 14b). Importantly, PFD markedly worsened DSS-triggered
colitis in wild-type mice to levels seen in Ace2 mutants (Fig. 1d–f;
Supplementary Fig. 14c–g). Thus, protein malnutrition alters the
severity of DSS-induced intestinal inflammation.
The general lack of dietary protein might induce broad effects on
several organ systems. We, therefore, set out to define whether a
specific amino acid might be responsible for the severe inflammatory
phenotype. Because serum tryptophan was markedly decreased in
Ace2 mutant mice, we focused on this essential amino acid.

Tryptophan is required for the in vivo generation of nicotinamide (also
known as vitamin B3 or niacin)17, and insufficient niacin or trypto￾phan in the diet is the cause of pellagra, a disease still endemic in many
countries with protein malnutrition20. More than 90% of pellagra
patients develop colitis11 and for nearly 80 years nicotinamide has been
used as treatment for pellagra. In Ace2 mutant mice, nicotinamide
almost completely alleviated the severe colitis and diarrhoea
(Fig. 2a-c; Supplementary Fig. 15). To demonstrate that the severe
colitis in Ace2 deficient mice is due to impaired tryptophan uptake,
we provided tryptophan in form of a Gly-Trp dipeptide to bypass the
loss of the single amino acid transporter B0
AT1. Dietary dipeptidic
tryptophan (a Trp1 diet) restored serum tryptophan levels
(Supplementary Fig. 16a) and rescued the enhanced DSS-susceptibility
of Ace22/y mice (Fig. 2d–f; Supplementary Fig. 16b–d). A tryptophan￾free (Trp2) diet resulted in a very marked increase in susceptibility to
DSS-induced inflammation (Supplementary Fig. 17a–h). In addition, a
Trp2 diet markedly worsened weight loss in wild-type mice
challenged with TNBS (Supplementary Fig. 17i–l). Our results show
that deficiency ofAce2 causes a critical impairment of local tryptophan
homeostasis which alters the susceptibility to intestinal inflammation.
It is conceivable that an altered amino acid availability in the
epithelium could lead to decreased regenerative responses and repair
mechanisms after epithelial injury21,22. However, proliferation rates
and cell death of small intestinal and colon epithelial cells were
comparable between control and Ace2 mutant mice following DSS
challenge (Supplementary Fig. 18). However, expression of multiple
antimicrobial peptides was markedly reduced in isolated gut ileal
epithelial cells from unchallenged Ace2 mutant mice (Fig. 3a; Sup￾plementary Fig. 19). A Trp2 diet for wild-type mice also resulted in
a significant downregulation of antimicrobial peptides (Fig. 3b).
Similar downregulation of antimicrobial peptides was observed on
feeding wild-type mice a PFD (Supplementary Fig. 20a). By contrast,
dietary nicotinamide (Supplementary Fig. 20b–g) and a Trp1 diet
(Fig. 3c and Supplementary Fig. 20h, i) triggered induction of antimi￾crobial peptides in intestinal epithelial cells from Ace2 mutant and
wild-type mice. Thus, dietary tryptophan controls expression of small
intestinal antimicrobial peptides.
Amino acids and nicotinamide can activate mTOR, which is
involved in cell proliferation, survival, protein synthesis and transcrip￾tion23. In epithelial intestinal cells from unchallenged Ace2 mutant
mice, we observed markedly impaired p70S6 kinase activity (Sup￾plementary Fig. 21a) as well as reduced S6 phosphorylation (Fig. 3d
and Supplementary Fig. 21b), indicative of reduced mTOR activity. A
similar reduction of mTOR activity was recently reported in mice
lacking B0
AT1 (ref. 24). Administration of a Trp1 diet resulted in
increased mTOR activity in the small intestine of Ace2 mutant mice
(Fig. 3e). In vivo inhibition of mTOR with rapamycin in wild-type
mice resulted in a significant downregulation of antimicrobial peptide
expression, an effect that could not be rescued by nicotinamide
(Supplementary Fig. 22a). Moreover, administration of rapamycin
before the first challenge with DSS increased the severity of colitis
(Fig. 3f; Supplementary Fig. 22b–h). Notably, although acute mTOR
inhibition may have beneficial effects in murine colitis models25,
mTOR blockade has not been proven successful in human clinical
trials in inflammatory bowel disease26. Thus, at the molecular level,
nicotinamide and dietary tryptophan appear to exert their effects on
intestinal antimicrobial peptides and colitis via the mTOR pathway.
How does ACE2 regulated uptake of tryptophan in the small intest￾ine affect DSS-induced inflammation in the colon? It has been shown
that a-defensins secreted into the ileum lumen persist in a functional
state throughout the entire gut27 and that alterations in antimicrobial
peptides can affect the ecology of the small and large bowel
microbiota28. We therefore performed deep profiling of the intestinal
microbiome ofAce2 mutant and wild-type littermates using 16S rDNA
fingerprinting. The luminal ileocaecal microbiome of Ace2 mutant
mice was markedly altered, as shown by weighted (Bray–Curtis)
(Fig. 4a) and unweighted (Unifrac) (Fig. 4b) analyses. Distinct opera￾tional taxonomical units (OTUs) are overrepresented in Ace2 mutant
mice (Fig. 4c; Supplementary Tables 1 and 2). Rapamycin treatment
resulted in a distinct alteration of the ileocaecal gut microbiome in
wild-type animals; but the altered microbiome was more closely
related to that found in untreated wild-type animals than that found
in untreated Ace22/y animals (Supplementary Fig. 23; Supplementary
Tables 3 and 4). Rapamycin acts on many different cell types that in
addition to the changes in intestinal epithelial cells could alter
microbiota composition29. Importantly, both Trp1 diet and
nicotinamide treatment reverted the composition of the intestinal
microbiota ofAce2 mutant mice to be more similar to that of untreated
wild-type littermates (Fig. 4a–c, Supplementary Fig. 24, Supplemen￾tary Tables 1, 2, 5 and 6). Thus, de-regulation of tryptophan amino acid
homeostasis in Ace2 mutant mice alters the intestinal microbiome.
Consistent with an alteration in the intestinal microbiome,
antibiotic treatment of Ace2 mutant mice alleviated the severe colitis
(Supplementary Fig. 25). Finally, we performed gut microbiome trans￾plantsfrom control andAce2 mutant mice into germ-free hostsfollowed
by DSS challenge. Transplantation of the ileocaecal gut microbiota from
Ace2 mutantmice transmitted the inflammatory phenotype to wild-type
hosts, which was not the case for mice that were colonized with the
microbiota of Ace21/y mice (Fig. 4d, e; Supplementary Fig. 26a–f).
Expression of antimicrobial peptides in wild-type mice did not change
significantly upon transplantation of Ace21/y or Ace22/y microbiota
within the timeframe of analysis (Supplementary Fig. 26g).
We propose the following scenario for how malnutrition and
tryptophan deficiency can cause diarrhoea and colitis. Dietary
tryptophan is primarily absorbed via the B0
AT1/ACE2 transport
pathway on the luminal surface of small intestinal epithelial cells.
This results in the activation of mTOR, either directly through nutrient
sensing and/or through the tryptophan-nicotinamide pathway. Fold mRNA expression Fold mRNA expression Fold Defa1 expression

mTOR then regulates expression of antimicrobial peptides, which
affect the intestinal composition of the gut microbiota. Whether
pathways other than mTOR and antimicrobial peptides also con￾tribute to the altered microbiome needs to be explored. Our results
further indicate that under conditions of intestinal injury, such an
altered microbiome contributes to the severity of colitis. Importantly,
our data indicate that the essential amino acid tryptophan and its
metabolite nicotinamide are key regulators of gut microbiota and of
propensity to inflammation.
Malnutrition is a major global health burden, affecting up to one
billion people in the world and its consequences such as colitis and
diarrhoea are often fatal1,2. In addition, chronic inflammatory condi￾tions of the intestine, cachexia, anorexia nervosa, or amino acid mal￾absorption constitute severe clinical problems30. Our results provide
novel mechanistic insights into how protein malnutrition can lead to
colitis and diarrhoea. Our data also identify a molecular crosstalk
between the RAS system and intestinal amino acid homeostasis via
ACE2—and provide a direct link between dietary amino acid meta￾bolism and innate immunity, the composition of the intestinal micro￾biota, and susceptibility to colitis.
METHODS SUMMARY
Colitis models. Ace2, Tmem27, Agtr1, Apj and Apelin mutant mice have been
described. Mice were given protein-free and tryptophan-free diet, tryptophan di￾peptides, nicotinamide, rapamycin, or were treated with catalytically active murine
ACE2 protein and challenged with DSS or TNBS. Bone marrow transplantations
were performed in lethally irradiated Ace2 mutant and wild-type mice. For micro￾biota transplantation, caecal and ileum extracts from Ace21/y orAce22/y mice were
transplanted to germ-free hosts. Severity of colitis was monitored as described13.
All experiments were performed in accordance with institutional guidelines.
Expression analyses. Small and large intestinal epithelial cells and mucosal cells
were purified and gene expression assessed using quantitative RT–PCR. Protein
expression was determined by western blot and localized using immunohisto￾chemistry. Immune cell populations were determined by FACS.
Microbiota sequencing. Genomic DNA was extracted from the terminal ileum,
amplified by PCR, and sequenced using Roche 454 Titanium chemistry. All
sequence reads were filtered for quality and length using PANGEA. Sequences
were clustered using average neighbour algorithm into species level operational
taxonomical units (OTUs). Distance matrices between samples were generated
based on weighted (Bray–Curtis similarity) and non-weighted (unweighted
UniFrac) algorithms and shown as principal coordinate analysis (PCoA).
Spearman correlations and similarity percentage analysis (SIMPER) were per￾formed to determine significant differences between bacterial communities among
genotype and diet groups.

METHODS
Mice. Ace2 (ref. 4),Agtr1a (ref. 31), Apelin (ref. 32), Apj2/2 (ref. 33) and Collectrin
(ref. 19) mutant mice have been described previously. All mutant strains were
backcrossed onto a C57BL/6 background more than 6 generations. Apj2/2 mice
were on a mixed C57BL/6 3 CBA background. In all experiments, only sex-,
age- and background-matched mice were used as controls. Mice were handled
and all experiments performed in accordance with institutional guidelines.
Colitis models.Acute colitis in C57BL/6 background mice was induced with 1.5%
(w/v) DSS (molecular mass 36–50 kDa; MP Biologicals) dissolved in drinking
water ad libitum for the experimental days 1–7 followed by normal drinking water
until the end of the experiment. For mixed C57BL/6 3 CBA background mice,
colitis was induced by feeding mice 5% (w/v) DSS. The DSS solutions were made
fresh every day. TNBS colitis was induced by intrarectal administration of 0.1 ml
TNBS (5 mg per mouse in 40% ethanol), through a feeding needle (Fine Science
Tools) 3.5 cm proximal to the anal verge as described previously34. Body weight,
diarrhoea, and occult blood in stool (Hemoccult test) were determined daily.
Diarrhoea scores were: 0, no diarrhoea; 1, mild diarrhoea; 2, severe watery
diarrhoea; 3, mild diarrhoea with blood; 4, severe watery diarrhoea with blood.
Colon length was determined at the end of the experiments. Crypt scores,
inflammation scores, and disease activity indexes were determined as previously
described13. For PFD experiment, normal chow (20.8% protein) and PFD (,0.2%
protein) were obtained from Ssniff GmbH. Mice were fed the protein-free, iso￾caloric diet for 3 days before start of the 1% (w/v) DSS treatment. Owing to the
severe diarrhoea in PFD fed mice, the experiment had to be stopped for ethical
reasons on day 4. For nicotinamide (NAM) treatment, mice were given NAM
(Sigma) in their drinking water (0.4 g l21
) from 3 days before the first DSS
treatment until the end of the experiment. For rapamycin (RAPA) treatment,
rapamycin (2 mg kg21 d21
; LC Laboratories) or vehicle were administered
intraperitoneally (i.p.) daily for 6 days with or without NAM treatment.
The solvent for rapamycin was 0.2% sodium carboxymethylcellulose, 0.25%
polysorbate-80 in water. For tryptophan rescue experiments, standard food was
supplemented with glycyl-L-tryptophan (Gly-Trp) hydrate (G0144, TCI Europe)
(10 mg per g dry food) daily for 10 days followed by 1.5% (w/v) DSS treatment.
Tryptophan-free diet was purchased from Oriental Yeast and was fed for 18 days
before DSS challenge. For antibiotic treatment, 4-week-old mice were placed on
broad spectrum antibiotics ampicillin (1 g l21
) and neomycin (0.5 g l21
) in drink￾ing water for 4 weeks followed by 1.5% (w/v) DSS treatment. For microbiota
transplantation, caecal and ileum extracts were pooled from Ace2 mutant mice
and ACE2 expressing littermates, suspended in 3 ml PBS, and administered
(0.1 ml per mouse) immediately to sterile-packed 4-week-old Swiss-Webster
germ-free mice (Taconic). Transplanted mice were maintained in sterile cages
for 2 weeks followed by 5% (w/v) DSS treatment. For ACE2 reconstitution, mice
received intraperitoneal injections of recombinant mouse ACE2 protein (0.1 mg
kg21
) (R&D) daily during 1.5% (w/v) DSS treatment.
Serum amino acid analyses.Heparinized serum was mixed with an equal part of a
solution containing 20 mg ml21 each of norleucine (internal standard for Ala, Gly
and Val), norvaline (for Leu, Ile and Pro) and parachloro-phenylalanine (for all
other amino acids) and deproteinized by ultrafiltration through a 10 kDa cutoff
regenerated cellulose ultrafiltration membrane (Millipore). Amino acids were then
purified by cation exchange, converted to their chloroformate derivatives and
separated and quantified by GC/MS in the selected ion monitoring (SIM) mode.
Tryptophan ELISA kit (LDN, BA E-2700) was used to assess Trp serum levels
upon Gly-Trp treatment.
Purification of intestinal epithelial cells and mucosal cells. After washing with
PBS, segments of small intestines were placed in 1.5 mM EDTA in Hank’s
balanced salt solution (HBSS) without calcium and magnesium and tumbled for
10 min at 37 uC. The mucosa was incubated again with HBSS/EDTA for 10 min at
37 uC. The supernatant containing the crypts was collected. The number and
viability of the crypt epithelial cells were determined by 0.1% trypan blue exclu￾sion. Purity of the epithelial cell preparation was checked by haematoxylin and
eosin staining. For mucosa preparations jejunum, ileum, or colon were inverted
and mucosa was scraped off with a scalpel.
Quantitative RT–PCR. Total RNA was prepared from isolated small intestinal
epithelial cells using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) in accordance with the
manufacturer’s instructions. Total RNA (0.2 mg) was subjected to reverse tran￾scription using random hexamers (Roche) and SuperscriptII (Invitrogen)
followed by quantitative PCR analysis. The following primers were used:

Western blotting and ELISA. Western blotting was performed with standard
protocols using isolated primary small intestinal epithelial cells. Primary antibodies
reactive to phosphorylated S6 (2215; Cell Signaling), S6 (2217; Cell Signaling), and
b-actin (Sigma) were used. Blots were washed three times in TBST for 30 min,
incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:5,000
dilution; Jackson ImmunoResearch) for 20 min, washed three times in TBST, and
visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence. Small intestine was collected for
ELISA assays to detect phosphorylated p70S6K or total p70S6K (DYC896,
DYC8962; R&D) and colon was collected to determine angiotensin II levels (EK￾002-12; Phoenix). To analyse membrane proteins, total membranes were prepared
using mannitol buffer (200 mM mannitol, 80 mM HEPES, 41 mM KOH, pH 7.5 in
the presence of protease inhibitor cocktail, Sigma). After homogenization of the
samples using MagNA Lyser green beads (Roche), total membranes were attained
by dual consecutive centrifugation steps (100g and 100,000g) at 4 uC. 50 mg of total
membrane were used per lane for western blotting. The following primary anti￾bodies were used: anti-Ace2 and anti-Ace (R&D Systems, 1:1,000), anti-B0
AT1
(Pineda, 1:1,000), anti-mouse b-actin (Sigma, 1:10,000). Antibody binding was
detected with Immobilon Western Chemiluminescent HRP or AP substrates
(Millipore) and chemiluminescence visualized with a DIANA III camera
(Raytest, Dietikon).
Histology and immunohistochemistry. For histological analysis, 2–4-mm-thick
sections were stained with haematoxylin and eosin. Immunohistochemistry was
performed using the automated Ventana system. Sections were incubated with
antibodies against phosphorylated S6 (Cell Signaling), Ace2 (R&D), Ki67
(Novacastra), and cleaved caspase 3 (Cell Signaling). For phosphorylated S6 and
cleaved caspase 3 staining, a multimer based detection system (UltraMap) was
used. In addition, immunofluorescence was performed on cryosections of the
kidney and small intestine using anti-Ace2 antibodies at 1:100, anti-B0
AT1 at
1:200, and anti-collectrin at 1:1,000 followed by Alexa488-conjugated anti-goat
IgG or Alexa594-labelled anti-rabbit IgG.
DNA extraction, pyrosequencing, sequence analysis. Genomic DNA from
terminal ileum was extracted by MO BIO PowerSoil DNA Isolation kit with
modifications: solution C1 and 20 ml of Proteinase K were added to faeces and
incubated for 2 h at 50uC to enhance the lysis. Extracted DNA was quantified by
using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA Assay Kit (Invitrogen). Variable region
V1-V2 of the 16S rRNA gene was amplified using the forward primer
59-CTATGCGCCTTGCCAGCCCGCtcagTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG-39.

and a four base key (lower case) were added. The reverse primer (59- CGTA
TCGCCTCCCTCGCGCCAtcagXXXXXXXXXXCATGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGA
GT-39) contained the 454 Life Sciences primer A sequence (bold) a unique 10 base
multiplex identifier (MIDs designated as XXXXXXXXXX) to tag each PCR
product, the broad-range bacterial primer 338R, and a ‘CA’ linker sequence
inserted between the MIDs and the rRNA gene primer. In addition, a four base
key (lower case) was added before the MIDs as described earlier35. Replicate PCR
reactions were performed for each sample and the respective negative controls.
Each reaction consisted of 1 ml (10 pmol ml
21
) of each primer, 40 ng of DNA, 1 ml of
dNTPs mix (10 mM stock), 1.0 units of Phusion Hot Start II High-Fidelity DNA
Polymerase, and 10 ml of 53 Phusion HF buffer. The final volume of reaction was
adjusted to 50 ml. Amplification was performed using an initial denaturation of
3 min at 98 uC followed by 30 cycles, denaturation at 98 uC for 10 s, annealing at
55 uC for 30 s and elongation at 72 uC for 30 s. Final extension was at 72 uC for
10 min. Amplified products were run on an agarose gel, specific bands excised and
amplicons purified using the Qiagen gel purification kit (Qiagen). Concentrations
of the eluted and purified amplicons were measured using the Quant-iT PicoGreen
dsDNA Assay Kit (Invitrogen). Equal amounts of PCR products were mixed in a
single tube and sequenced using Roche 454 Titanium chemistry. To generate
negative control templates for the PCR reaction, water was taken as a sample
during DNA extraction; in all cases, the PCR reactions from these templates were
negative.
Sequence analysis. After pyrosequencing, all sequence reads were screened and
filtered for quality and length using PANGEA36. Sequences were trimmed and
binned by samples using the specific MIDs as barcode. Sequences not meeting the
following quality criteria were excluded from further analysis: no perfect match
with MID sequences or specific primers; reads shorter than 200 bases; mean
quality score $25; the presence of any ambiguous base; and/or more than 8
homopolymers. Remaining sequences were aligned using the curated SILVA seed
database (bacterial reference alignment) as a template with the Needleman￾Wunsch algorithm37. Sequences not matching with defined core regions and
putative chimaeric sequences were detected by using the uchime38 command
implemented in Mothur39 and were subsequently removed. Sequences were
further confirmed to originate from bacteria using the Ribosomal Data base
project (RDP) classifier with 60% bootstrap threshold40. For all the downstream
analysis, 1,000 sequences per samples were randomly sampled to normalize the
number of reads distribution. In order to reduce the overestimation of distances
between sequences, leading and trailing periods from aligned files were removed.
Pairwise distances between sequences were calculated, gaps of any length were
treated as single event or mismatch. Sequences with $97% similarity were
clustered using average neighbour algorithm in to species level operational
taxonomical units (OTUs)41. Phylogenetic affiliation of each OTU was performed
by using RDP taxonomy and a template file. To visualize the microbial composi￾tion and structure in related on host genotype or treatment, distance matrices
between samples were generated based on weighted (Bray–Curtis similarity) and
non-weighted (unweighted UniFrac) algorithms and visualized using principal
coordinate analysis (PCoA). OTUs contributing for the shifting of the samples
along the two axes were ascertained by calculating the Spearman correlation of
each OTU with the two axes in the PCoA39. Similarity percentage analysis
(SIMPER)42 was performed to determine the driving OTUs imparting significant
differences among bacterial community composition among genotype and diet
groups. The analysis was performed on Bray–Curtis similarity coefficient with the
program PAST (Paleontological Statistics, ver. 2.14)43.
Bone marrow transplantation. Eight week old Ace2 mutant and Ace2 wild-type
mice were lethally irradiated with 980 cGy (Gammacell 40). Bone marrow cells
were harvested from 8–9-week-old donor Ace2 mutant or Ace2 wild-type mice by
flushing the femurs and tibias with DMEM. Recipient mice received 5 3 106 bone
marrow cells in 250 ml DMEM from male donor mice by tail vein injection 6 h after
irradiation. Six weeks after transplantation, the genotypes of haematopoietic cells
were determined by PCR using peripheral blood. The PCR primer set for the
mutant Ace2 allele was as follows: 59-CCAGCTCATTCCTCCCACTC-39 and
59-CCGGCTGCTCTTTGAGAGGACA-39. The PCR primer set for wild-type
Ace2 was: 59-CTTCATTGGCTCCGTTTCTTAGC-39 and 59-CCGGCTGCTC
TTTGAGAGGACA-39.
Calorimetry cages. Average food intake was measured using indirect calorimetry
cages from TSE Systems over a period of seven days following 48 h of acclimat￾ization. Data were analysed with proprietary Phenomaster Analysis Software (TSE
Systems) and Microsoft Excel.
Statistical analyses. All data are shown as mean 6 s.e.m. Measurements at single
time points were analysed by ANOVA and if significant, further analysed by a two￾tailed t-test. P , 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance.
