1. Introduction 
IoT is a network of a widespread of daily objects, which can produce exchange and exploit information 
using least human being contribution [23]. These devices differ in their energy, size, calculation power, 
and storage ability. For instance, IoT objects range from the smart home appliance (for example 
refrigerators and toasters) to monitor the health products (for example blood pressure monitors and 
pacemakers), to tiny actuators and sensors. In 2020, it is predictable that regarding a hundred billion IoT 
devices will attach to the Internet, most important to an 11 trillion-dollar economic force. In the 
subsequent decade, the power of IoT will not only make more available devices but also much data [1]. 
There are many protocols and methods to guarantee communication and connectivity among objects 
in the IoT environment, and ad-hoc mode indicates the most important algorithms [11]. An ad-hoc 
network is an impermanent infrastructure-less peer-to-peer network system, whereas every device

gathers, stores processes, and forwards data [23]. In a multihop scenario, a transmitting object exploits 
other objects as a relay to expand it possesses coverage of transmission. Hence, a device lies on 
intermediate objects to set up routes and forward packets to their destinations. Ad-hoc networks present 
multiple benefits like speedy deployment and cost efficiency, flexibility, robustness, and mobility 
maintenance. Ad-hoc connectivity is enveloping in various IoT exploit scenarios like disaster rescue, 
environment sensing, e-health, logistics, CITS, battlefield, etc. Also, the ad hoc mode is the important 
support of 5G deployment modes which can aid in increasing the network’s coverage area, assuring 
services’ resiliency, and improving user experience. 
An important augment in the exploit of IoT devices is transporting several business chances [7]. 
Nevertheless, still firms are not capable to assure their customers that these devices are safe [8]. 
Therefore, despite all of the benefits, security problems of these devices are act as an enormous rock in 
the method of leasing this instance creation an enormous effect on human lives. Unintended deployment 
of an extraordinary number of insecure and susceptible IoT nodes requests attackers for performing 
attacks, like DDoS attack. The extensive scale distribution and the open nature of these devices produces 
security confronts related using an enterprise of secure communication, authentication privacy, storage, 
and access control [10]. Thus far, there is perplexity among producers and customers of these devices as 
they stay on critical each other for vulnerabilities in these devices. In producer’s opinion, customers are 
in charge of not update their devices and for not altering passwords frequently, while customers 
incessantly criticize manufacturers for not presenting adequate security features in devices themselves 
[9]. 
The main contribution of this work is to model and extend a secure routing protocol for IoT via 
presenting an optimization method. Two parameters are considered such as energy utilization and nodes 
trust in modeling secure routing protocol. Hence, Salp-Particle swarm-based (Salp-PSO) secure routing is 
developed. The complete process of the developed secure protocol comprises subsequent 4 steps: Initially, 
the route trust level is analyzed and subsequently, the multilayer-feed forward layer is used to choose 
the secure nodes. At first, the node's energy level is calculated, ensued by calculation of trust exploiting 
several trust factors, such as indirect and direct trust, mutually using a novel trust factor, called active 
trust that is devised recently on basis of the assured behavior of the nodes. Subsequently, a multilayer￾feed forward layer is used for choosing the secure nodes. Once these secure nodes are selected, route 
selected and the discovery of route is carried out by exploiting the developed Salp-PSO approach. 
2. Literature Review 
In 2019, Jinbo Xiong et al [1], a new KDE approach that was subsequently exploited to model an SDDK 
method for IoT devices. At first, a nodal key tree based on flash memory’s hierarchical model was 
designed, and a KDE approach was developed to create data key for make simpler key management and 
encrypting user’s sensitive data. In the meantime, based on KDE, an SDDK strategy was proposed by 
integrating partial block erasure using a key deletion approach. 
In 2019, Farhan Siddiqui et al [2], developed an open-source implementation for CoAP utilizing 
DTLS to apply secure data transfer among IoT devices. In real IoT testbed, the impact of DTLS on CoAP 
was examined. By exploiting the open-source software and resource-constrained IoT devices was 
developed. 
In 2020, Badis Hammi et al [3], developed a lightweight and secure routing method that integrates 
trust management and multipath routing, which can adjust to diverse cases in the IoT environment. 
Moreover, a probabilistic model was proposed, which contemplates 2 kinds of events that influence the 
performance of routing for a given node such as mobility and uncooperative behavior to examine and 
assess the proposed method. 
In 2020, Shivi Sharma and Hemraj Saini [4], implemented secure deduplication and task allocation 
over 4 layers of Fog aided Cluster-based Industrial IoT. To sense data and mitigate security threats, the 
IoT device layer was exploited. By exploiting the ECC-HM was modeled in this layer and was registered 
to the cloud server. In the fog layer, SHA-3 was developed for secure data deduplication. Moreover, for 
data encryption, the ECC HM private key was exploited before transmitted the data. By exploiting 
Merkle Hash Tree, a layer index was modeled in the cloud. 
In 2020, Ankur Lohachab et al [5], worked on the new efforts comprise of re-inventing cryptographic 
solutions during the exploit of light-weight operations. Nevertheless, after observer the development of 
quantum computers, it can be incidental that cryptographic approaches based on the mathematical 
issues were not consistent sufficient. Hence, there was necessitating developing solutions, which can 
simply oppose the adversarial effects and were appropriate for the post-quantum world. 
In 2019, Geetanjali Rathee et al [6], developed a secure Hybrid Industrial IoT mode exploiting the 
Blockchain method. In more than one country, a hybrid industrial architecture was exploited whereas

diverse branches of a company were positioned. Even though IoT devices were exploited in numerous 
organizations and help in minimizing their production costs besides by means of enhancing quality, 
numerous threats can happen in IoT devices started by several intruders. Intruders might cooperate 
with IoT devices with the reason for doing malicious activities. 
3 Advanced Secure Route Selection in IoT 
In IoT, the selection of the secure route is efficient in order to enable the best communication against the 
secure routes that is the main objective of this work. Moreover, this work states the selection of a secure 
route on the basis of the optimization, Salp-PSO which selects the multipath to develop communication. 
At first, nodes are given to computation of energy and trust that creates input to secure node chosen 
system that is developed by exploiting the multilayer-FNN in IoT. The input to multilayer-FNN is direct, 
active trust, and indirect trust, and the energy that is evaluated for each network node and secure nodes, 
is completed. To tune optimal weights, a multilayer-FNN classifier is utilized and secure nodes require in 
a secure routing procedure. By exploiting secure nodes, paths are identified that are carried out via 
fixing a sender and receiver nodes and optimal paths are selected on the basis of the developed algorithm 
that is fitness-constrained. Fig. 1 exhibits the architecture model of secure routing in IoT. Let us 
represent an IoT network by means of m number of nodes and consider th l node as, Nl
; 1  l  m. The 
energy and the trust of m nodes are calculated and secure nodes are selected on the basis of multilayer￾FNN, total secure nodes are stated as, stherefore s  m .

multilayer-FNN classifier. 
3.1.1 Calculation of Energy and Trust 
The energy and trust calculation of the nodes are stated as below: 
There are 3 kinds of trust such as direct, indirect, and active trust [12] [13]. Besides the nodes energy 
is represented for devising the secure nodes. 
i) Direct Trust: on account of the fulfillment of a node concerning the target, the node direct trust is 
calculated. Eq. (1) represents direct trust of th l node based on its occurrence.

In eq. (1), Wlp indicates the fulfillment degree of the node l on the basis of the th p neighbors and q
indicates the total neighbors of the node l . It is motivating to mention that node l obtains the superior 
degree of fulfillment when the service offered by a node l is fulfilled by node p and fulfillment degree is 
based on the fulfilled transaction of the neighboring node p . Hence, a fulfillment degree is offered by a 
node p to node l based on the winning transactions that are shown in eq. (2). In eq. (2), Tlp indicates the 
accomplishment transactions of total nodes and m indicates total nodes in the IoT network

iv) IoT nodes energy: The energy is considered as a third parameter [14] of IoT nodes and energy is 
a necessary module as the sensor nodes in IoT are operating using energy-constrained batteries that 
maintain on the detail of energy conservation of nodes to increase network lifespan. 
Consider, E0
 as IoT node initial energy. During communication, when the transferred data is 
obtained by recipient data-loss arises and this loss is considered as on the basis of the nodal features and 
broadcast distance among nodes in IoT. In network, the routing protocol permits broadcast and 
dissipation of energy is because of the occurrence of radio electronics and power amplifier in the

transmitter. In a node, the energy dissipation at the time of the data packet transmission is formulated 
as stated in eq. (9).

In eq. (9),   Edis Nl

Bl
indicates the total bytes transmitted from th l node, and Epa indicates the energy, which is similar to 
the power amplifier in attendance with transmitter. The parameter 0
is based upon the energy 
dissipation and it is calculated on the basis of the evaluation amid the distance among the th g head and 
parameter 0 and th l sensor node. In particular, while the distance among the th l node Nl regarding the CH

In eq. (12), Eagg indicates the energy equivalent to the data aggregation and Etx indicates the 
transmitter energy. It is significant to state that when a normal node Nl
in the environment tries to 
communicate by means of Cg
, energy-loss happens in cluster head and this energy loss based upon the 
electrical energy accessible at receiver side and in addition, on the data bytes obtained at the cluster 
head. Eq. (13) represents the dissipation of energy at th g CH. 
  Edis Cg  Eelec Bl

Ahead of the conclusion of the communication, sensor nodes, and cluster heads occupied in broadcast 
and receiver, updates its energy and the eq. (14) and (15) states the energy dissipated at nodes.

updated energy of the CH, and   Edis Cg
 indicates the dissipation of energy in the cluster head or the 
receiver at the time of obtaining data packets from the normal node. 
Similarly,   Et Nl
 indicates the earlier accessible energy in normal node,   Et1 Nl
indicates the 
updated energy of normal node, and   Edis Nl
 indicates the dissipated energy in normal nodes at the time 
of transmission. In nodes, the energy, and cluster heads, persist till the node is deceased with “0” energy. 
3.2 Multilayer FNN for Finding The Secure Nodes 
The multilayer-FNN model is used to determine the secure nodes by exploiting the energy, direct trust, 
active trust, and indirect nodes' trust in the environment. The need for facilitating the secure routing in 
IoT persevered to assess energy and the trust of all nodes and lead to chosen of the nodes by means of the 
maximum value of trust and energy. 
In multilayer- FNNs, former layer neurons are fully linked to the ensuing layer, whereas no intra￾layer associations are set up [16]. FNNs were widely used in image classification, scene labeling trend 
prediction, and other tasks. Currently, one more the majority well-liked application of FNNs is 
represented as concluding CNN's output layer, whereas high-level feature extraction is attained via 
pooling, convolutional, and normalization layers. In existing FNNs, otherwise called rate-based FNNs, 
neurons represent linear static units that openly summation of weighted input signals from the 
preceding layer and get ahead of attained value to the subsequent layer. 
For many application issues, activation functions for softmax and ReLU were extensively exploited in 
the output layer for intermediary feature processing in hidden layers, correspondingly. In [15] developed 
that the stage function ReLUs very much faster the stochastic gradient descent convergence evaluated to 
sigmoid/tanh functions because of its linear, non-saturating model. In addition to taking into 
consideration, the improvement of ReLUs in order to calculate performance in order to determine the

secure nodes by exploiting the energy, direct trust, active trust, and indirect trust of nodes, ReLUs in 
networks at the time of the training process. A characteristic mathematical formulation is stated in (16).

The Multilayer-FNN has various neurons modeled in layers namely input, hidden and output layers 
shown in Fig. 2. The output layer considers additional numerous neurons present output for additional 
numerous inputs. In one neuron instance, the training process undergoes to discover appropriate weights 
for neuron connections that in amalgamation by means of inputs, attains preferred output. This 
procedure is achieved using the backpropagation model [17].

4. By the Developed Salp-PSO Algorithm for Optimal Multipath Selection 
In this section, steps to choose multipath by exploiting secure nodes, and it is determined by employing 
multilayer FNN and an optimal selection of multipath is performed via the developed Salp-PSO are 
presented. At first, all probable paths are identified by exploiting the Dijkstra shortest path method and 
the optimal multipath is determined on the basis of the developed Salp-PSO utilizing the fitness 
constraints like energy, trust, and the distance of the secure nodes. 
4.1 Route Discovery 
The probable paths are produced via arbitrarily fixing the sender and receiver nodes for the chosen of the 
optimal multipath. A total of n paths are produced via fixed sender and receiver nodes for the creation of 
paths, the least distance among the sender and receiver is considered. Hence, on the basis of minimum 
distance, the paths are created that are chosen on the basis of the fitness constraints using the Salp-PSO 
algorithm. 
4.2 PSO Algorithm 
PSO is easy and a competent population-based optimization algorithm [18]. The algorithm's main 
objective is to discover the global optimal solutions by exploiting community communication of group and 
self occurrence elements. In PSO, each iteration comprises updated particles via a velocity that is 
updated by inertia, group and self-experience movements. 
This algorithm is learned from the animal’s behavior to compute the global optimization 
functions/issues, each partner of swarm/crowd is known as a particle. In the PSO method, the location of 
every partner of the crowd in the global search space is updated using two mathematical formulations.    

4.3 Salp Swarm Optimization (SSO) Algorithm 
Salp swarming approach is the most important motivation to construct SSA [19]. For the number of 
control variables N , the salp position is decided in N dimensional space of searching. As a result, salp 
positions are stored in a matrix by means of 2 dimensions called Yl . The FP represents the objective of 
salp swarms. The most important steps of SSO are described as below: 
(a) Initialize the SSO population in allowable restrictions. 
(b) For the initial locations, the computation of the fitness function is performed. 
(c) Update location of salps: In this algorithm, the salps population initiates at arbitrary locations in 
the search domain. The length of the salp is equivalent to several control variables. Subsequently, the 
locations of salps are performed as below:

4.4 Proposed Salp- PSO Algorithm 
The flow chart of the hybrid Salp-PSO algorithm is exhibited in Fig. 3. The most important characteristic 
of this hybridization is the capability to evade drawbacks associated with the PSO method and to employ 
the benefit of SSO technique. The hybridization method is initiated by the arbitrary population 
initialization. Subsequently, by the PSO method, the population is updated and the best solution is 
chosen. The chosen solutions are sophisticated and updated using the SSO algorithm. The better solution 
is chosen and subjected to the subsequent iteration. This procedure is sophisticated until any halting 
condition is fulfilled. 
5. Result and Discussion

simulation area, energy, number of nodes, mobility and propagation model. The algorithms exploited for 
comparison such as MBO [20], LASeR [21], and SCOTRES [22] that was evaluated with the developed 
algorithm to reveal the competence of developed technique of secure routing.

detection, delay, and throughput, is envisaged at the end of the iteration.

comprehensible that the delay of the developed algorithm is less and energy is high when compared with 
the conventional models from Fig 4. Fig 5 states the analysis of developed and conventional models

In IoT the secure routing is done by exploiting the secure routing protocol, Salp-PSO that was the 
incorporation of the Salp with PSO therefore that energy, and throughput of nodes, was not affected even 
in attendance of attacks. The rate of attacker exposure was found to be enhanced for the developed 
algorithm by means of improved performance. In the network, to facilitate security, energy, and the trust 
of nodes, was calculated and secure nodes were selected by exploiting the multilayer-FNN method. In the 
multipath routing, the secure nodes were concerned for that the optimal multipath was selected based on 
the developed Salp-PSO by exploiting the constraints, like distance, energy, and nodes trust in path, it is 
considered significant to employ any path generation method for that Dijkstra shortest path method was 
exploited. Hence, the paths created by exploiting the Dijkstra shortest path method were optimally 
selected employing the developed method to enables secure routing in the network. The experimentation 
of IoT network shows that developed algorithm outperforms conventional algorithms by means of 
maximum throughput, energy, and the rate of detection and the least delay.
