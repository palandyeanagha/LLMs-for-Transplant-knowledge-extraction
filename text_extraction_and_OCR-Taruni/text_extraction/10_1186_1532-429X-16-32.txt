Abstract
Background: A relationship between myocardial fibrosis and ventricular dysfunction has been demonstrated using
late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) in the pressure-loaded right ventricle from congenital heart defects. In patients
with Eisenmenger syndrome (ES), the presence of LGE has not been investigated. The aims of this study were to
detect any myocardial fibrosis in ES and describe major clinical variables associated with the finding.
Methods: From 45 subjects screened, 30 subjects (age 43 ± 13 years, 20 female) underwent prospective
cardiovascular magnetic resonance with LGE to quantify biventricular volume and function as well as maximal and
submaximal exercise during a single visit. Standard cine acquisitions were obtained for ventricular volume and
function. Further imaging was performed after administration of 0.1 mmol/kg gadolinium contrast. Regions of LGE
were evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively by manual contouring of identified areas, with total area expressed
as a percentage of mass. Patients were followed prospectively (mean follow up 7.4 ± 0.4 years) and any deaths
recorded. Patients with LGE findings were compared to those without.
Results: LGE was present in 22/30 (73%) patients, specifically in RV myocardium (70%), RV trabeculae (60%), LV
myocardium (33%) or LV papillary muscles (30%), though in small amounts (mean 1.4% of total ventricular mass,
range 0.16 – 6.0%). Those with any LGE were not different in age, history of arrhythmia, desaturation, nor
hemoglobin, nor ventricular size, mass, or function. Exercise capacity was low, but also not different between those
with and without LGE. Similarly no significant associations were found with amount of fibrosis. There were five deaths
among patients with LGE, versus two in patients without, but no difference in survival (log rank =0.03, P = 0.85).
Conclusions: Myocardial fibrosis by LGE is common in ES, though not extensive. The presence and quantity of LGE did
not correlate with ventricular size, function, degree of cyanosis, exercise capacity, or survival in this pilot study. More
data are clearly required before recommendations for routine use of LGE in these patients can be made.

Background
Eisenmenger syndrome (ES) is a multisystem disorder.
In addition to other vulnerable organs, myocardial dys￾function can occur from long-standing pressure loading
and cyanosis, and heart failure is a common cause of
eventual death [1]. As such, the etiology of ventricular
dysfunction and its bearing on survival are of interest,
including the process of myocardial fibrosis, which can
be detected using cardiovascular magnetic resonance
(CMR) with late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) [2].
Through several studies, LGE has been demonstrated in
various congenital heart disease subgroups including those
with tetralogy of Fallot, transposition of the great arteries,
and following a Fontan palliation [3-6]. Collectively, these
studies find that LGE is associated with several clinical
markers of cardiovascular dysfunction, including ventricu￾lar enlargement, systolic dysfunction, poorer NYHA class,
arrhythmia, elevations of brain natriuretic peptide and
lower exercise capacity. Fibrosis appears to be an import￾ant player in the process of heart failure in adult congeni￾tal heart disease (ACHD) [7]. More diffuse microscopic
fibrosis has also been demonstrated in ES [8].
Therefore, as part of a large prospective cohort study
of Eisenmenger patients, we sought to define the preva￾lence and extent of LGE in ES and explore meaningful
associations with other clinical or functional parameters
and survival. We hypothesized that LGE would be more
prevalent in patients with more cyanosis and ventricular
dysfunction, and that it would portend worse survival.
Methods
Patients
Consecutive adults with ES, defined as a known intra￾cardiac or extracardiac shunt with increased pulmonary
vascular resistance and reversed or bi-directional shunt
resulting in hypoxemia at rest, were invited to partici￾pate. Subjects were excluded for acute decompensated
heart failure, active hemoptysis, recent surgery, or non￾elective hospitalization, but were invited to participate
after resolution of the event. Subjects with contrain￾dications to CMR were excluded, including those with
impaired renal function (creatinine > 1.5 mg/dl) who
were ineligible for gadolinium contrast. Other elements
from this prospective descriptive study have been previ￾ously reported [9,10]. The study was performed at Royal
Brompton Hospital according to accepted clinical stan￾dards, after institutional ethics approval. All subjects
gave signed informed consent prior to participation. Pa￾tients with developmental delay were allowed to partici￾pate if they were able to comply with verbal commands
and provide oral assent with written consent signed by
a parent or guardian. Data were obtained during a sin￾gle intake visit.
Cardiovascular magnetic resonance
CMR was performed using a 1.5 Tesla scanner (Sonata,
Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) with a phased array body
coil. After standard initial localizers and long-axis acquisi￾tions using steady-state free precession, short-axis cine im￾ages (7 mm with 3 mm spacing) were obtained from base
to apex. Volumes of the right ventricle (RV) and left ven￾tricle (LV) at end-diastole and end-systole, indexed to
body surface area, were calculated by contouring the epi￾and endocardial borders from short axis images. Contour￾ing included trabeculae and papillary muscles as part of
the myocardial mass, per our standard protocol [3]. For
patients with a ventricular septal defect (VSD), the same
phase was used to define end-systole for both ventricles,
and delineation between the RV and LV chambers at the
defect was done using a line in direct continuity with the
septum. The septum was included in LV mass quantifica￾tion but hypertrophied trabeculae along the RV side were
quantified as part of the RV mass. Phase-velocity mapping
was performed in the main pulmonary artery to measure
pulmonary blood flow.
LGE imaging was obtained 5–20 minutes after
0.1 mmol/kg IV gadolinium-DTPA (Magnevist, Bayer
Schering Pharma, Berlin, Germany) administration. Mul￾tiple short-axis slices from base to apex were acquired
using a segmented fast low-angle shot inversion recovery
sequence (TE 4.3 ms, TR <90% of RR interval, FA 20, slice
thickness 8 mm, 2 mm gap) as employed in other projects
[3,4]. Inversion time ranged from 300 – 420 ms, adjusted
as needed for appropriate nulling of normal myocardium.
Presaturation pulse masking of cerebrospinal fluid was
employed. Long-axis acquisitions were also obtained using
the same sequence, as well as repeated short-axis planes
with altered direction of phase encoding to clarify artifacts.
Images were analyzed offline using CMR tools (CMR
Tools, London, UK) with contrast/brightness settings
adjusted for uniform dark signal from normal myocar￾dium. Images were compared to cine images in the same
plane to ensure that small regions of enhancement were
not areas of pooled gadolinium between trabeculae. LGE
was defined as an area of increased signal within myo￾cardium equal or greater to blood pool signal. Confirm￾ation was obtained by comparing images with altered
phase/frequency-encoding direction. Location and two￾dimensional area of each region of enhancement were
recorded. Total area was multiplied by slice thickness to
give volume of LGE, converted to mass expressed as a
percentage of total myocardial mass, similar to methods
employed previously [3]. Enhancement was categorized
by location within RV myocardium, RV trabeculae, LV
myocardium, or LV papillary muscle, each expressed as
a percentage of patients studied, with 95% confidence
limits. Enhancement only within the RV-LV junction, a
common finding in hypertrophy, was also noted but

considered separately as it may not represent myocardial
pathology in pulmonary hypertension [11].
Exercise testing
All participants completed a sub-maximal 6-minute walk
test. Distance walked was recorded in meters [12]. Patients
also performed maximal exercise testing on a treadmill
with a modified Bruce protocol with respiratory mass
spectrometer (Amis 2000, Innovision, Odense, Denmark)
for measurement of oxygen consumption (VO2), carbon
dioxide production (VCO2), anaerobic threshold, peak
VO2, and ventilatory efficiency slope (Ve/VCO2).
Survival
Patients received follow-up at Royal Brompton Hospital,
where detailed records were available for each. All patients
were accounted for at the time of final analysis. For de￾ceased patients, date of death and cause of death were ob￾tained. Otherwise, date of last known clinical follow-up
was recorded. Other standardized data in follow-up were
not obtained.
Statistical analysis
Analysis was done using SPSS for Windows 11.0. Con￾tinuous variables were compared with student’s t-test,
while categorical variables were compared by chi-square
or Fisher’s exact test. Non-normal variables (brain natri￾uretic peptide) were compared using the Mann–Whitney
U test. Univariate regression was done using Pearson’s
correlation coefficient. Results were expressed as mean ±
SD or median/interquartile range, with p < 0.05 considered
statistically significant. Variables associated with survival
were identified using Kaplan-Meier analysis, though low
numbers of events limited more in-depth analysis of
survival.
Results
Of 61 Eisenmenger patients screened, 45 patients met all
inclusion/exclusion criteria for MRI scanning. From these
30 were successfully studied with LGE. Clinical and labora￾tory details are provided (Table 1). Reasons for no LGE im￾aging were patient tolerance with extended scanning or
breath holding (N = 5), limited available scanner time (N =
4), poor image quality, usually as a result of limited ability
to breath-hold (N = 4), renal insufficiency (N = 1), and pro￾vider preference (N = 1). Those without LGE imaging were
younger (33 ± 10 vs. 43 ± 13 years, p = 0.014) and had a
faster heart rate during the scan (88 ± 11 vs. 74 ± 12,
p = 0.001), possibly reflecting increased anxiety during
scanning. There was no difference in oxygen saturation,
exercise capacity, ventricular size or function, or survival
among those in whom LGE was or was not performed. Of
those completing the LGE portion, three had malposed
great arteries (double outlet right ventricle in two, and D￾transposition with a VSD in one, who had undergone a

palliative Mustard procedure). Two had developmental
delay.
LGE findings were analyzed both qualitatively and quan￾titatively (Table 2). Qualitatively, any enhancement (other
than RV-LV junction) was found in 22 (73%) patients.
LGE was most prevalent in small areas of RV myocar￾dium, found in 21 (70%), but also RV trabeculae in 18
(60%), LV myocardium in 10 (33%), and LV papillary mus￾cles in 9 (30%) subjects. Examples are shown (Figure 1,
Figure 2). All patients with LGE had enhancement of the
RV wall except one, who had a small area of enhancement
within the LV wall only. There were no typical patterns of
enhancement (such as midwall fibrosis, probable surgical
sites, or plausible coronary distribution). Only one patient
had transmural enhancement in a small area of the in￾ferior right ventricular free wall (Figure 2). Enhancement
of the RV-LV junction was common (17 patients, 57%).
Quantitatively, the median amount of LGE was 0.7% of
myocardial volume (range 0.16 – 6.0%).
Clinical significance of late enhancement
Qualitatively, those with any LGE did not differ in age, his￾tory of arrhythmia, oxygen saturation, nor hemoglobin,
nor RV or LV size, mass, or function. Comparisons be￾tween those with and without RV enhancement are shown
(Table 1), and similar comparisons for all other types of en￾hancement also showed no significant differences (data not
shown). Exercise capacity (both maximal and submaximal)
was also not different between patients with and without
LGE. Quantitatively, no associations were found between
quantity of LGE and other clinical variables (Table 3), in￾cluding an analysis by location of enhancement.
Ventricular size and function
There was a correlation between RV and LV ejection
fraction (r = 0.694, P < 0.001), with RV ejection fraction
slightly lower than LV (Figure 3, left). All patients had se￾vere RV hypertrophy (RV mass index 70 ± 26 g/m2
) and
RV mass correlated with LV mass (72 ± 27 g/m2
, r = 0.448,
P =0.0195, Figure 3, right). Two outliers were those with
malposed great arteries.
Survival
All patients were accounted for in follow-up (mean
follow-up 7.4 ± 0.4 years for living patients). The longest
duration of follow-up was 8.4 years. There were seven
deaths total, five among patients with LGE present, two
in patients without LGE findings. In addition there were
three deaths in those who did not complete the LGE
portion of the scan. Of those studied with LGE, three
died of heart failure, but only one of these had detect￾able LGE. Two others died of non-cardiac causes (blad￾der carcinoma and acute abdomen). In two more the
cause of death was unknown. The presence of LGE in
any form did not differentiate survivors from non￾survivors (log rank =0.03, P = 0.85). Kaplan Meier curves
are shown (Figure 4). There were more early deaths in
the LGE-positive group, but also more patients in this
group, and no difference in survival was found even if
events were censored after 4 years. Similarly, no signifi￾cant differentiation was found based on location of
enhancement.
Discussion
The use of any imaging technique should be driven pri￾marily by its ability to direct management decisions, in￾form disease mechanisms or estimate prognosis. Studies
in congenital heart disease have demonstrated that LGE is
associated with poorer functional class, ventricular volume
and function, exercise capacity and arrhythmia [3-6,13]. In
the present study of Eisenmenger patients, we found small
amounts of fibrosis were very common, especially in the
more vulnerable RV, indicating that mechanisms driving
fibrosis are present. Quantified amounts were very small
in part because of our decision to express values as a per￾centage of total RV and LV mass (given large VSDs in
many patients). However, we could not find any meaning￾ful clinical correlation with LGE, including clinical history,
ventricular function, exercise capacity, and survival, des￾pite multiple comparisons.
Identification of fibrosis demonstrates susceptibility to
this final common pathway of ventricular dysfunction, par￾ticularly of the RV. Both chronic cyanosis and pressure
loading likely contribute to various signaling pathways lead￾ing to myofibroblast activity that causes fibrosis [14-16]. Fi￾brosis in turn is generally associated with arrhythmia and
myocardial dysfunction, which is a common cause of even￾tual death in ES as suggested by recent studies [1,17]. Dif￾fuse fibrosis may be a potential target for pharmacotherapy,
although LGE is unlikely to be sensitive enough to detect
change. Many antifibrotic medications are vasodilators,
which may be detrimental if they reduce systemic afterload
more than pulmonary afterload and thereby promote right￾to-left shunting.
There are several plausible explanations for the lack of
association between LGE and clinical variables in this

study. First, our sample was small. Although the study
enrolled a limited number of patients, all data were ac￾quired prospectively, and the cohort reflected the wide
range of ES with long follow-up. While it is certainly
possible that a larger sample size may show statistical
differences, our data suggest that such differences may
be small, even clinically insignificant. Despite the rela￾tively smaller sample, we followed our patients for a
considerably longer period of time compared to other
studies, looking for clinical endpoints that may be re￾lated to the presence of fibrosis even in a small study.
Yet after eight years of follow-up we could not show a
meaningful association.
Second, while fibrosis is certainly present, it is likely
more diffuse [8]. In performing these scans, it was
challenging to appropriately null signal from normal
myocardium. Diffuse non-replacement fibrosis affect￾ing the bulk of the myocardium could create diffi￾culties in identifying normal reference myocardium
for nulling. In other studies, we have used T1 mapping
methods to determine extracellular volume fraction
and shown diffuse fibrosis to be present in 90% of in
cyanotic congenital heart patients including ES. Im￾portantly, the amount of fibrosis was often not de￾tectable as dense replacement fibrosis using LGE in
the same individuals [8]. Admittedly the quantitative

methods used here were simplistic, and inaccuracies
of measuring low amounts of fibrosis are possible. For
diffuse fibrosis, LGE may not be the method of choice
for detection and quantification in patients such as
this [18].
Third, our methods of quantification may have been
overly sensitive, suggested by our high prevalence of rela￾tively small areas of fibrosis. Our initial aim was to be in￾clusive of any type of enhancement, not knowing whether
clinical significance would be found. Images were acquired

and interpreted by trained, experienced imagers, and we
are reasonably confident in our ability to avoid artifacts,
etc. Still, image quality can at times be limited, and inter￾pretation was largely subjective. We specifically excluded
enhancement due to blood pooling within trabeculae or
RV-LV junctional enhancement due to hypertrophy [11],
recognizing that contrast enhancement may not always
implicate fibrosis. A contrary argument could be made
that newer techniques with better sensitivity that have
evolved since the start of this project could potentially
show more abundant fibrosis.
Finally but perhaps most relevant to clinical practice,
ES is a multi-organ disease, with many different causes
of clinical symptoms, exercise capacity, and death. Fibro￾sis likely only plays a small role in the overall clinical
trajectory of the patient. In fact, there were several non
cardiac related deaths, and of the three patients with
CHF-related death, two had no detectable LGE. Thus, it
is possible that even in a larger population the presence
of dense fibrosis in ES may still not have a demonstrable
association between LGE and function or survival.
An additional novel finding from our study was that
the RV and LV were morphologically and functionally
similar, Mass and volume were linearly related; the LV
had a proportionately larger mass, mostly due to inclu￾sion of the septum. LGE was present in both ventricles
but more abundant in the RV. The similarity of the two
ventricles is congruous with the understanding that both
face similar loading conditions from birth due to the
shunt. The RV mass does not diminish in the postnatal
period following a fall in pulmonary vascular resistance
as occurs in those without shunts. Furthermore, the LGE
data demonstrated fibrosis in both ventricles, not just the
adversely loaded RV, as we have demonstrated in other
conditions [4]. This is an important distinction from other
forms of pulmonary arterial hypertension where the RV
becomes disproportionately larger and more dysfunctional
than the LV [18].
Clinical relevance
Our study confirms the presence of myocardial fibrosis in
ES, particularly in the morphologic RV, as found in smaller
series [8]. Small amounts are consistent with the hypoth￾esis that fibrosis is more diffuse in nature rather than
dense replacement fibrosis. While this is important in con￾sidering the pathophysiology of ventricular dysfunction in
this group, LGE does not appear to have significant clin￾ical implications at present that would likely alter manage￾ment. While laboratories may perform LGE routinely for
every cardiac study, the data herein offer no support for
this as routine practice in ES. Gadolinium-based contrast
agents have an extensive history of relative safety, yet use
has fallen under greater scrutiny in the years following the
initiation of this study. While we know of no long-term
adverse effect from Gadolinium administration in our pa￾tients, one cannot assume this would always be the case.
Rare complications related to gadolinium administration
may occur in the setting of renal insufficiency, for which
the ES population is at risk [19]. There is also a remote
chance of unintended systemic embolism from intra￾venous access in ES. These caveats should prompt hesi￾tation before performing LGE routinely in this fragile
population.
We note that CMR can offer valuable information for
ES including clarification of anatomy, ventricular function,
measurement of flow/shunts, and inspection of the pul￾monary arteries including detection of thrombi [10]. How￾ever, prioritizing clinically relevant questions in the CMR
protocol is important, including consideration of the rela￾tive value and potential risks of contrast administration.
Conclusions
Although LGE is common in ES, it appears to be of lim￾ited extent, particularly in the RV. LGE did not correlate
with functional capacity, severity of shunt or cyanosis,
ventricular size or function, or arrhythmia in this study.
Its routine application cannot be recommended at present
by our pilot data. Further studies inclusive of measuring
diffuse fibrosis in ES are warranted.
