Abstract
Idiopathic nephrotic syndrome newly affects 1–3 per 100,000 children per year. Approximately 85% of cases show complete
remission of proteinuria following glucocorticoid treatment. Patients who do not achieve complete remission within 4–6 weeks of
glucocorticoid treatment have steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS). In 10–30% of steroid-resistant patients, mutations in
podocyte-associated genes can be detected, whereas an undefined circulating factor of immune origin is assumed in the remaining
ones. Diagnosis and management of SRNS is a great challenge due to its heterogeneous etiology, frequent lack of remission by
further immunosuppressive treatment, and severe complications including the development of end-stage kidney disease and
recurrence after renal transplantation. A team of experts including pediatric nephrologists and renal geneticists from the
International Pediatric Nephrology Association (IPNA), a renal pathologist, and an adult nephrologist have now developed com￾prehensive clinical practice recommendations on the diagnosis and management of SRNS in children. The team performed a
systematic literature review on 9 clinically relevant PICO (Patient or Population covered, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome)
questions, formulated recommendations and formally graded them at a consensus meeting, with input from patient representatives
and a dietician acting as external advisors and a voting panel of pediatric nephrologists. Research recommendations are also given.

Introduction
Idiopathic nephrotic syndrome (NS), characterized by severe
proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, and/or presence of edema [1,
2], newly affects about 1–3 per 100,000 children aged below
16 years [3–5]. Approximately 85% of cases experience com￾plete remission of proteinuria following daily oral
prednisolone/prednisone (PDN) treatment at standard doses
[6]. Those who do not achieve remission after 4–6 weeks of
treatment are presumed to have steroid resistant NS (SRNS)
[7]. The duration of PDN required before a patient is consid￾ered steroid-resistant is a matter of discussion and longer treat￾ment periods (6–8 weeks), as well as additional intravenous
methylprednisolone (MPDN) pulses, have been reported [6].
In 10–30% of patients with non-familial SRNS, mutations
in podocyte-associated genes can be detected, whereas an un￾defined circulating factor(s) is assumed in the remaining cases
[8–10]. The principal histopathological entities encountered in
SRNS are focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS),
minimal change disease (MCD), and diffuse mesangial scle￾rosis. Treatment usually includes inhibitors of the renin￾angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAASi) and calcineurin in￾hibitors (CNI) in patients with non-genetic forms of SRNS.
With this approach, complete or partial remission can be
achieved in 50–70% of cases [6, 7].

Management of SRNS is a great challenge due to its het￾erogeneous etiology, frequent lack of remission induced by
immunosuppressive treatment, and complications including
drug toxicity, infections, thrombosis, the development of
end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), and recurrence after renal
transplantation [11]. There are currently no evidence-based,
systematically developed recommendations on the diagnosis
and management of children with SRNS available, with the
exception of a focused document from KDIGO (Kidney
Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) Glomerulonephritis
guideline [6]. Therefore, the International Pediatric
Nephrology Association (IPNA) convened a clinical practice
recommendation (CPR) workgroup in December 2018 to de￾velop CPRs for the diagnosis and management of children
with SRNS. Future research recommendations regarding key
outcome measures in patients with SRNS are also presented.
Methods
Overview of the guideline project
We have followed the RIGHT (Reporting Items for practice
Guidelines in HealThcare) Statement for Practice Guidelines
[12]. Three groups were assembled: a core leadership group,
an external expert group, and a voting panel. The core group
comprised 18 members of IPNA, including pediatric nephrol￾ogists, renal geneticists, epidemiologists, an adult nephrolo￾gist, and a renal pathologist. The individual expertise and re￾sponsibilities of the core group members are given in
Supplementary Table S1. The external expert group included
3 patient representatives and one dietician. The patient repre￾sentatives discussed the manuscript provided by the core
group members within their local parents’ association, and
their suggestions were then incorporated into the manuscript.
The voting panel included 23 pediatric nephrologists includ￾ing 3–5 representatives of each IPNA Regional Society with
expertise in the management of SRNS in children. Voting
group members were asked by electronic questionnaire to
provide a level of agreement on a 5-point scale (strongly dis￾agree, disagree, neither agree/disagree, agree, strongly agree)
(Delphi method). For topics that failed to achieve a 70% level
of consensus, the recommendations were re-evaluated and
modified by the core group and then reviewed again by the
voting panel until a consensus level of > 70% was achieved.
Developing the PICO questions
We developed PICO (Patient or Population covered,
Intervention, Comparator, Outcome) questions as follows
[13]: Population: Children (> 3 months and < 18 years) with
SRNS; Intervention and Comparators: treatment compared
with no treatment, other treatment or placebo; Outcomes
Addressed: We addressed recommendations for the diagnosis,
treatment, and follow-up of children with SRNS (including
efficacy to induce remission and side effects of medications).
Literature search
The PubMed database was searched for studies published by
15 September 2019; all systematic reviews of randomized con￾trolled trials (RCTs) on treatment of SRNS in children, RCTs,
prospective uncontrolled trials, observational studies, and reg￾istry studies on diagnosis and treatment of children with SRNS,
restricted to human studies in English. Where possible, meta￾analyses of RCTs using risk ratios were cited from the updated
Cochrane systematic review regarding interventions for child￾hood steroid resistant NS (SRNS) [14]. Further details and a
summary of the publications used for this CPR are given in the
Supplementary material (Supplementary Tables S2–S5).
Grading system
We followed the grading system of the American Academy of
Pediatrics (Fig. 1; [16]). The quality of evidence was graded
as High (A), Moderate (B), Low (C), Very low (D), or Not
applicable (X). The latter refers to exceptional situations
where validating studies cannot be performed because benefit
or harm clearly predominates. This letter was used to grade
contra-indications of therapeutic measures and safety param￾eters. The strength of a recommendation was graded as strong,
moderate, weak, or discretionary (when no recommendation
can be made).
Limitations of the guideline process
SRNS is a rare disease. Consequently, the sizes and numbers
of some RCTs were small and of poor methodological quality
so most recommendations are weak to moderate. Due to the
limited budget of this IPNA initiative, patient representatives
and dieticians were only included as external experts.
Clinical practice recommendations
Definitions and diagnostic work-up
Definitions
& We recommend quantification of proteinuria by protein/
creatinine ratio (UPCR) in either a first morning (AM)
urine or 24-h urine sample at least once before defining
a patient as SRNS and/or starting alternative immunosup￾pression. We suggest using this baseline value for assess￾ment of subsequent response (grade A, strong
recommendation).
1530 Pediatr Nephrol (2020) 35:1529–1561

& We suggest using the definitions listed in Table 1 for the
diagnosis and management of SRNS (grade B, moderate
recommendation).
& We suggest using the “confirmation period,” which is the
time period between 4 and 6 weeks from start of oral PDN
at standard doses, to assess the response to further treat￾ment with glucocorticoids and initiate RAASi (grade C,
weak recommendation). We also recommend performing
genetic testing and/or a renal biopsy at this time (grade B,
moderate recommendation).
& We suggest the submission of histological, clinical, and
genetic data from all SRNS patients into patient registries
and genetic databases to help improve our understanding
of the disease and its treatment (ungraded).
Evidence and rationale
Assessment of proteinuria
The conventional definition of NS in children is proteinuria >
40 mg/h/m2 or ≥ 1000 mg/m2
/day or urinary protein creatinine
ratio (UPCR) ≥ 200 mg/mmol (2 mg/mg) or 3+ on urine dip￾stick plus either hypoalbuminemia (< 30 g/l) or edema [17].
Urinary dipstick analysis is useful for screening and at home
monitoring of proteinuria, but therapeutic decisions should be
based on at least one precise quantification of proteinuria, i.e.,
UPCR on a first-morning urine sample, or 24-h urine collec￾tion after treatment for > 4 weeks with full-dose PDN. First￾morning urine samples are preferred over random spot sam￾ples to reduce the influence of orthostatic proteinuria [18, 19].
Given the linear relationship between UPCR in spot and 24-h
urine protein, determination of UPCR is recommended. If
either UPCR measurement is ≥ 200 mg/mmol (2 mg/mg), then
treatment for SRNS should begin. Semiquantitative expres￾sion of dipstick results is given in Supplementary Table S6.
Definition of SRNS
The initial treatment of children with idiopathic NS usually
comprises oral PDN 60 mg/m2
/day or 2 mg/kg/day (maxi￾mum 60 mg/day) for 4–6 weeks, followed by 40 mg/m2 or
1.5 mg/kg per dose on alternate days (QOD) for another 4–
6 weeks. After the initial 4 weeks of full-dose oral PDN, a
child can achieve complete remission (UPCR ≤ 20 mg/mmol
(0.2 mg/mg) or negative or trace dipstick on three or more
consecutive occasions), which confirms SSNS. If partial re￾mission is observed, given the fact that a small percentage of
children achieve complete remission if given 2 additional
weeks of time, the “confirmation period” begins. During this
time, responses to further daily oral PDN with or without 3
pulses of MPDN (500 mg/m2 or 15 mg/kg), and RAASi are
ascertained (Fig. 2). If complete remission is achieved by
6 weeks, the child is defined as “late responder” SSNS and
treated as SSNS. If no remission is achieved by 6 weeks, the
diagnosis of SRNS is confirmed (Fig. 2). We recommend
performing a renal biopsy as well as obtaining genetic testing
results (where available) as soon as possible, ideally within the
2-week confirmation period. If genetic results are not avail￾able at the end of the confirmation period, we suggest to start
treatment with CNI and to reassess treatment after receiving
genetic results. In the setting of low-resource countries where
genetic and/or histopathology assessment is not available, im￾mediate immunosuppressive treatment with CNI may be
started. If CNI are not available intravenous or oral cyclophos￾phamide (CPH) may be started (vide infra). Details on evi￾dence and rationale for these definitions are given in the
Supplementary Material.
Definition of CNI-resistant nephrotic syndrome
Among those children defined as SRNS without a genetic
cause, a substantial proportion will respond to CNIs in a var￾iable amount of time (weeks to months). Children with initial

SRNS who are CNI responders subsequently either remain in
stable remission with no or infrequent relapses or may develop
secondary SSNS. Resistance to CNIs is defined when a child
fails to attain at least partial remission after at least 6 months of
CNI treatment administered at adequate doses and blood
levels.
Definition of multi-drug resistant nephrotic
syndrome
Children resistant to CNIs may be treated with other steroid￾sparing agents (see “Developing the PICO questions”; Fig. 2
and Supplementary Table S2). Patients with SRNS are defined
as “multi-drug resistant” in the absence of complete remission
after 12 months of treatment with 2 mechanistically distinct
steroid-sparing agents (including CNIs) administered at stan￾dard doses.
Initial diagnostic workup of a child with SRNS
& We recommend obtaining a careful family history for renal
and extra-renal manifestations including asking about
consanguinity. Where renal diseases are present in family
members, the age at onset, clinical course including re￾sponse to medications, renal function, and renal biopsy
and genetic testing results should be obtained wherever
possible (grade A, strong recommendation).
& We recommend careful physical examination of the pa￾tient including a meticulous search for extra-renal mani￾festations such as skeletal, neurological, eye, ear and uro￾genital abnormalities, and for secondary causes (mainly
infectious) of NS (Table 2) (grade A, strong
recommendation).
& We suggest that the blood, serum, and urine tests listed in
Table 2 be performed to search for immunological or in￾fectious causes of SRNS and to evaluate the degree of
Table 1 Definitions relating to nephrotic syndrome in children
Term Definition
Nephrotic-range proteinuria UPCR ≥ 200 mg/mmol (2 mg/mg) in first morning void or 24 h urine sample
≥ 1000 mg/m2
/day corresponding to 3+ or 4+ by urine dipstick
Nephrotic syndrome Nephrotic-range proteinuria and either hypoalbuminemia (serum albumin < 30 g/l) or
edema when serum albumin level is not available
SSNS Complete remission within 4 weeks of prednisone or prednisolone (PDN) at standard dose
(60 mg/m2
/day or 2 mg/kg/day, maximum 60 mg/day).
SRNS Lack of complete remission within 4 weeks of treatment with PDN at standard dose
Confirmation period Time period between 4 and 6 weeks from PDN initiation during which response to further
oral PDN and/or pulses of iv MPDN and RAASi are ascertained in patients achieving
only partial remission at 4 weeks. A patient achieving complete remission at 6 weeks is
defined as a late responder. A patient not achieving complete remission at 6 weeks
although he had achieved partial remission at 4 weeks is defined as SRNS.
Complete remission UPCR (based on first morning void or 24 h urine sample) ≤ 20 mg/mmol (0.2 mg/mg) or
negative or trace dipstick on three or more consecutive occasions.
Partial remission UPCR (based on first morning void or 24 h urine sample) > 20 but < 200 mg/mmol and, if
available, serum albumin ≥ 30 g/l.
Relapse Recurrence of nephrotic-range proteinuria. In children, relapse is commonly assessed by
urine dipstick and is thus defined as dipstick ≥ 3+ on 3 consecutive days, or UPCR
≥ 200 mg/mmol (2 mg/mg) on a first morning urine sample, with or without reappearance
of edema in a child who had previously achieved partial or complete remission.
CNI-resistant SRNS Absence of at least partial remission after 6 months of treatment with a CNI at adequate
doses and/or levels.
Multi-drug-resistant SRNS Absence of complete remission after 12 months of treatment with 2 mechanistically distinct
steroid-sparing agents at standard doses (see text).
Secondary steroid resistance Children with initial steroid-sensitivity who in subsequent relapses develop SRNS
Recurrent nephrotic syndrome
post-renal transplantation
A child with SRNS presenting post-renal transplantation with a relapse of nephrotic-range
proteinuria in the absence of other apparent causes and/or podocyte foot process
effacement on kidney biopsy. This diagnosis should also be considered in case of
persistent proteinuria (UPCR ≥ 100 mg/mmol (1 mg/mg) in a previously anuric patient,
or an increase of UPCR ≥ 100 mg/mmol (1 mg/mg) in a patient with prevalent proteinuria
at the time of transplant in the absence of other apparent causes.

proteinuria, estimated GFR, and renal histology (grade B,
moderate recommendation).
& We suggest offering urinalysis to siblings of SRNS pa￾tients even before genetic testing is done (grade C, mod￾erate recommendation).
Evidence and rationale
Early identification of genetic forms of SRNS (listed in
Table 3) is important, as these patients are unlikely to ben￾efit from prolonged and potentially harmful immunosup￾pression. Delineation of family history to recognize
familial forms and a careful physical examination to iden￾tify extra-renal features (given in Supplementary Table S7)
of genetic conditions are essential. Occasionally, SRNS
can be secondary to infectious causes, mainly cytomegalo￾virus (CMV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hep￾atitis B, malaria, parvovirus B19, and syphilis. Other
causes of SRNS can be sickle-cell disease, lymphoma,
membranous nephropathy, membranoproliferative glomer￾ulonephritis, C3 glomerulopathy, IgA nephropathy, sys￾temic lupus erythematosus, Alport syndrome/collagen IV
glomerulopathy, amyloidosis, and thrombotic microangi￾opathy (TMA). Workup for these conditions should be
considered especially in patients presenting with a reduced
estimated GFR (eGFR) and may include kidney biopsy,
Fig. 2 Algorithm for the management of children with nephrotic
syndrome. Patients are characterized according to response to a 4-week
treatment with oral prednisolone (PDN). Patients showing no complete
remission enter the confirmation period in which responses to further oral
prednisolone (PDN) with or without methylprednisolone (MPDN) pulses
in conjunction with either angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors
(ACEi) or angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs) are ascertained and
genetic and histopathological evaluation is initiated. Patients with non￾genetic SRNS should be candidates for further immunosuppression,
whereas those with monogenetic forms are not (further details are given
in the text). In the setting of low resource countries where genetic and/or
histopathology assessment is not available, immediate
immunosuppressive treatment with CNI may be started. If CNI are not
available intravenous or oral cyclophosphamide may be started. * = We
suggest tapering PDN after CNI initiation as follows: 40 mg/m2 QOD for
4 weeks, 30 mg/m2 QOD for 4 weeks, 20 mg/m2 QOD for 4 weeks,
10 mg/m2 QOD for 8 weeks, and discontinuing thereafter; ** = CNI
may be continued in case of partial remission; *** = in cases of no
complete response within 4 weeks, frequent relapses or side effects of
medications, we recommend following the refractory SRNS protocol;

genetic testing, and/or assessment of complement C3, C4,
antinuclear antibodies, anti-streptococcal antibodies, and
ANCA. Later in the disease course, a low eGFR may signal
progression of disease, acute kidney injury (AKI), or drug
toxicity. Renal ultrasound including Doppler evaluation
assists with evaluation of congenital abnormalities of the
kidney and urinary tract and vascular thrombosis, which
can also be a cause of proteinuria. Given the 25% risk of
disease in siblings if a patient has autosomal recessive
SRNS, urinalysis is advisable for siblings.
Indications for genetic testing and renal biopsy
& We recommend, if available, that genetic testing be per￾formed in all children diagnosed with primary SRNS
(grade B, moderate recommendation).
& We suggest giving priority to genetic testing in familial
cases (family history of proteinuria/hematuria or CKD of
unknown origin), cases with extra-renal features, and
those undergoing preparation for renal transplantation
(grade C, weak recommendation).
& We recommend a kidney biopsy in all children diagnosed
with SRNS, except in known infection or malignancy￾associated secondary disease or potentially in patients
with familial and/or syndromic cases or genetic causes of
SRNS (grade A, strong recommendation).
& We suggest genetic testing before a kidney biopsy in chil￾dren with SRNS, especially in priority cases (see above),
provided the results will be readily available (within few
weeks) (grade D, weak recommendation).
& We do not recommend performing genetic testing in pa￾tients with initial steroid sensitivity who subsequently de￾velop steroid resistance later in their disease course (i.e.,
secondary steroid resistance) (grade C, moderate
recommendation).
Evidence and rationale
Genetic testing
Genetic testing in SRNS patients (i) may provide patients
and families with an unequivocal diagnosis, (ii) may uncov￾er a form of SRNS that is amenable to treatment (e.g., co￾enzyme Q10), (iii) may avoid the necessity of a renal biopsy
and allow early weaning of immunosuppressive therapy,
(iv) may allow accurate, well-informed genetic counseling
including risk of recurrence post-transplantation [23, 24],
and (v) may allow appropriate diagnosis and management
of extrarenal manifestations [25, 26]. With whole exome
sequencing (WES) technology, 10–30% of children are
now diagnosed with a monogenic disease [8]. Mutations
in NPHS2, WT1, and NPHS1 are the most common genetic
SRNS causes in European patients, accounting for 42, 16,
and 13% of genetic cases, respectively [26]. Mutations in
the NPHS2 gene caused SRNS in ~ 20–30% of sporadic
Caucasian cases [23]. The likelihood of identifying a caus￾ative mutation is inversely related to age at disease onset and
is increased with either a positive family history or the pres￾ence of extrarenal manifestations [27], but genes commonly
implicated in one population may not be common in another
population [28–30]. In patients with monogenic forms of
SRNS, immunosuppressive treatment should be withdrawn
since there is evidence supporting the ineffectiveness of this
treatment [31].
Renal biopsy
Renal biopsy allows the exclusion of the other differential
diagnoses listed above (e.g., membranous nephropathy) and
the confirmation of a primary podocytopathy (MCD, FSGS,
or DMS). Moreover, it allows the detection and grading of

tubular atrophy, interstitial fibrosis, and glomerulosclerosis as
prognostic markers [32, 33]. Therefore, once a child is defined
as having SRNS, a renal biopsy should be performed accord￾ing to current standards as described in Supplementary
Material to determine the underlying pathology before initiat￾ing treatment with CNI, unless a clear monogenic form of
SRNS known to be unresponsive to immunosuppression is
identified. This is particularly relevant in settings where access
to genetic testing is limited.
Genetic testing and counseling
& We recommend comprehensive gene panel analysis (i.e., a
next generation sequencing panel to include all currently
known SRNS genes, which is currently the most cost￾effective approach to genetic testing) (genes are listed in
Table 3) unless the clinical phenotype is suggestive of a
specific condition, in which case we suggest performing a
single gene analysis instead (grade B, moderate
recommendation).
& We suggest determining the pathogenicity of identified
genetic variants according to the guidelines of the
American College of Medical Genetics [34]. Family seg￾regation analysis may be performed in selected cases
(grade B, moderate recommendation).
& We recommend genetic counseling for patients and their
families to help them interpret both anticipated and unan￾ticipated genetic findings (grade B, moderate
recommendation).
Evidence and rationale
We recommend performing genetic testing according to cur￾rent standards [24, 35]. This includes confirmation of patho￾genic or likely pathogenic variants by Sanger sequencing. In
cases where no causative mutations are found in known gene
panels, whole exome sequencing or whole genome sequenc￾ing may be considered, especially if the suspicion of a genetic
etiology is high. Caution and expertise are required in
interpreting variants of unknown significance [36]. Without
genetic counseling patients and their families may not under￾stand the significance of genetic findings [37].
Screening for infections
& We recommend evaluation for subclinical tuberculosis ac￾cording to country-specific guidelines (i.e., chest radiog￾raphy, tuberculin test, quantiferon assay), if clinically
suspected, or in case of residence in or travel from endem￾ic areas (grade C, moderate recommendation).
& We suggest testing for hepatitis B, C, syphilis, and HIV: (i)
to rule out secondary causes of NS and (ii) before immu￾nosuppression, especially rituximab, given the endemicity
of these infections in various countries (grade C, weak
recommendation).
Evidence and rationale
Accounting for country-specific disease prevalence and indi￾vidual risk assessment, evaluations for infections causing sec￾ondary forms of SRNS should be completed.
Treatment
First-line non-immunosuppressive treatment in children
with SRNS
& We recommend starting RAASi with either angiotensin
converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) or angiotensin re￾ceptor blockers (ARBs) once the diagnosis of SRNS is
made (Fig. 2) (grade B, moderate recommendation).
& We suggest quantifying the change in first-morning pro￾teinuria after starting RAASi therapy (grade D, weak
recommendation).
& We suggest aiming for the maximum approved dosages
given in Table S8 as tolerated (grade C, weak
recommendation).
& ACEi or ARBs should be used with caution in patients
with CKD stage 4, and they should not be started or
should be stopped in case of intravascular volume deple￾tion, acute kidney injury (AKI), hyperkalemia, or frequent
vomiting/diarrhea (grade X, strong recommendation).
& We suggest using RAASi with non-renal metabolism (i.e.,
ramipril and ARBs) since they do not accumulate in renal
failure (grade D, weak recommendation).
& In female adolescents, contraception should be ensured in
order to avoid the teratogenic effects of RAASi (grade X,
strong recommendation).
Evidence and rationale
In CKD patients RAAS blockade by ACEi or ARBs decreases
intraglomerular pressure, decelerates progression of CKD,
and reduces proteinuria [38–42]. We recommend aiming for
the maximum approved dosages as tolerated since dose￾dependent antiproteinuric effects of ACEi with reductions of
~ 30% are expected [39]. Complete remissions have been re￾ported in children with SRNS after therapy with ACEi or
ARBs without additional medications other than PDN [43].
Pediatr Nephrol (2020) 35:1529–1561 1539

Therefore, in children with confirmed or suspected SRNS, this
treatment may be commenced as early as 4 weeks from PDN
initiation, during the so-called confirmation period. However,
ACEi/ARBs may increase the risk for AKI, especially in pa￾tients with advanced CKD or intravascular volume depletion
[44, 45]. Combined treatment with ACEi and ARBs is dis￾couraged due to the increased risk for adverse events includ￾ing AKI and death [46]. Agents with non-renal metabolism
should be preferred since they do not accumulate in CKD
(Table S8) [44]. Contraception is essential in female adoles￾cents to avoid RAAS blocker fetopathy [47].
First-line immunosuppressive treatment in children with
SRNS
& We recommend that CNI (cyclosporine or tacrolimus)
should be the first-line immunosuppressive therapy in
children with SRNS and started once the diagnosis is
confirmed (Fig. 2 ) (grade B, moderate
recommendation).
& We suggest tapering PDN treatment once diagnosis of
SRNS is established and discontinuing PDN therapy after
6 months (grade D, weak recommendation).
& We recommend withholding or delaying CNI treatment in
patients with an eGFR < 30 ml/min/1.73 m2
, AKI, and/or
uncontrolled hypertension (grade X, strong
recommendation).
& We recommend withholding CNI and stopping PDN treat￾ment in patients with evidence for a monogenic form of
SRNS (grade B, moderate recommendation).
& When CNIs are not available or unaffordable, we suggest
using cyclophosphamide (CPH) [intravenous or po] with
or without high-dose steroids (grade D, weak
recommendation).
& We recommend making patients and families aware of
potential side effects of immunosuppressive medication
as given in Table 4 (grade X, strong recommendation).
Evidence and rationale
Calcineurin inhibitors
The use of CNI as first-line therapy in children with SRNS
was assessed in 8 RCTs comparing the efficacy of cyclospor￾ine (CsA) with either placebo [48], no treatment [49, 50],
intravenous MPDN [51], MMF with dexamethasone [52], or
tacrolimus (TAC) [53, 54], and CsA or TAC with intravenous
CPH [55, 56], on the outcome of “number with complete or
partial remission” (Supplementary Table S2). CsA compared
with placebo, no treatment, or intravenous MPDN showed
superior outcome (~ 75% vs. 22%) irrespective of
histopathology (risk ratio 3.50 (95% CI 1.04–9.57) [14].
There was no difference in outcome when TAC was compared
with CsA (risk ratio 1.05 [95% CI 0.87–1.25]) [14, 53, 54].
CsA or TAC was more effective than intravenous CPH (78%
vs. 40%; risk ratio 1.98 [95% CI 1.25–3.13]) [55, 56]. CsA
compared with MMF in combination with dexamethasone
was similarly effective (46% vs. 33%; risk ratio 1.38 [95%
CI 0.9–2.10] [52]. TAC was more effective when compared
with MMF in order to maintain remission (90% vs. 45%; risk
ratio 2.01 [95% CI 1.32–3.07) [57]. When CsAwas compared
with placebo, no treatment, or MPDN, no differences were
detected in the number of patients developing ESKD but event
numbers were very small [48, 51, 58]. When CNIs were com￾pared with intravenous CPH, there was an increase in serious
adverse effects with CPH, but there were no differences in
persistent nephrotoxicity or death [55]. No differences were
detected in comparisons of CsA, MMF + dexamethasone, or
TAC in terms of outcomes of ESKD, or 50% decline in eGFR
[52, 53, 55, 57].
Treatment with CNIs is discouraged in patients with
reduced eGFR, AKI, and/or uncontrolled hypertension
due to their nephrotoxic effects. However, in patients with
chronic CKD and no other option for disease control,
CNIs may improve proteinuria and long-term kidney sur￾vival [59].
SRNS patients who do not show at least partial remission to
CNI by 6 months are deemed CNI resistant, and those who do
not respond to CNI plus another agent that is mechanistically
distinct by 12 cumulative months of therapy as multi-drug
resistant (vide supra). If a monogenic form of SRNS known
not to respond to immunosuppression is identified in a patient
and no response to immunosuppression has previously been
observed in the patient, then immunosuppression should be
discontinued. We suggest that patients in these categories re￾main off immunosuppression but continue on RAASi therapy
until they reach advanced stages of CKD and can no longer
tolerate RAASi (Fig. 2).
Alkylating agents and low resource settings
When compared with PDN/placebo, CPH showed no dif￾ference in the outcome of complete remission (risk ratio
1.06 95% CI 0.61–1.87) [60, 61]. Overall, 36% children
on CPH compared with 35% on PDN achieved complete
remission [60]. Similar remission rates were noted in pa￾tients receiving intravenous or oral CPH (each ~ 50%) [14,
62–64]. The response to CPH reported in some observa￾tional studies may indicate a certain overlap of SSNS and
SRNS [65, 66]. Older studies may have included children
with monogenic causes of NS, given that genetic testing
was not commonly available for patients before 2000–
2010 resulting in low response rates to CPH. CPH may
be trialed to induce remission in resource-limited settings,
1540 Pediatr Nephrol (2020) 35:1529–1561

but should be stopped in case of achieving no-response.
Since chlorambucil was not evaluated in any RCTs, we
make no suggestions for its use.
CNI schedule, monitoring, and co-interventions
& We suggest a starting CsA dose of 3–5 mg/kg/day (max
starting 250 mg/day) given orally twice daily (grade B,
weak recommendation).
& We suggest titrating the CsA dosage in at least daily
intervals aiming for CsA whole blood trough levels
between 80 and 120 ng/ml based on assays validated
against tandem mass spectrometry (grade B, weak
recommendation).
& We suggest a TAC starting dose of 0.1–0.2 mg/kg/day
(max starting 5 mg/day) given orally twice daily (grade
B, weak recommendation).
& We suggest titrating the TAC dose aiming for trough
levels between 4 and 8 ng/ml. We also suggest ti￾tration intervals of at least 3 days (grade B, weak
recommendation).
& We suggest monitoring CsA/TAC trough levels at least
weekly until target levels are reached, and then every 1–
3 months together with serum creatinine as a safety pa￾rameter (grade D, weak recommendation) (Table 2).

& We recommend reducing CNI dosage or its withdraw￾al if eGFR decreases below 30 ml/min/1.73 m2 (grade
X, strong).
Evidence and rationale
Although monitoring of CsA at 2 h post dose (C2) is the most
accurate single time point for assessment for therapeutic level
[67], C2 target levels in SRNS patients are not widely
established or practical for routine use. Instead, whole blood
trough measurements by tandem mass spectrometry are rec￾ommended. These assays give lower readings than immuno￾assays, which were previously used. The ranges of CsA levels
reported in RCTs vary widely [48, 49, 52, 53, 56, 58]. More
recent studies use lower levels of CsA (troughs of 80–
150 ng/ml), with an initial starting dose of 5–6 mg/kg/day
[53–55, 57]. Since, even low CsA trough levels can be asso￾ciated with long-term nephrotoxicity in children with NS, we
suggest targeting CsA trough levels of 80–120 ng/ml, al￾though higher levels may be more effective but should be
analyzed together with serum creatinine as a safety parameter.
High dosages of CsA (C2 levels > 600 ng/ml) showed in￾creased risk for CsA nephrotoxicity especially when given
in combination with ACEis/ARBs in children with SDNS
[68]. Levels should be monitored weekly until steady state
and then every 1–3 months.
Duration of CNI treatment
& We suggest a minimum treatment period of 6 months to
determine the response to CNIs (grade B, weak
recommendation).
& We recommend that CNIs should be stopped if partial
remission is not achieved at 6 months (grade B, moderate
recommendation).
& If complete remission is achieved, CNI dosages should be
reduced to the lowest dosage required to maintain remis￾sion. We also suggest considering discontinuation of CNIs
after 12–24 months in these patients to reduce the risk of
nephrotoxicity (grade C, weak recommendation). In these
patients, switching to MMF can be considered to mini￾mize nephrotoxicity and maintain remission (vide infra).
& If relapses occur after CNI discontinuation, we suggest
restarting patients on CNIs for a trial together with 4 weeks
of high-dose oral PDN. Alternately MMF or may be con￾sidered (grade C, weak recommendation).
& If partial remission is achieved, we suggest continuing
CNI at the same dosage for a minimum of 12 months
(grade C, weak recommendation).
Evidence and rationale
Due to the risk of nephrotoxicity and side effects related to
long-term immunosuppression (see Table 4), CNIs should be
discontinued after 6 months if at least a partial remission is not
achieved. If complete remission is achieved, we suggest con￾sidering discontinuation of CNIs after 12–24 months. See
“Treatment of relapse” for relapse therapy.
Mycophenolate mofetil
& If immunosuppression is considered in a child with SRNS
and an eGFR < 30 ml/min/1.73 m2
, we suggest that MMF
rather than CNIs be used due to the risk for nephrotoxicity
with CNI (grade C, weak recommendation).
& We suggest considering the use of MMF to maintain re￾mission in children with SRNS in remission following
CNI if they develop a steroid sensitive relapse (grade C,
weak recommendation).
& In patients with SRNS who have attained full remission on
CNI therapy for at least 12 months, we suggest consider￾ing conversion to MMF as an alternative immunosuppres￾sive agent rather than continuing CNIs (grade C, weak
recommendation).
Evidence and rationale
If immunosuppression is considered in a child with SRNS and
an eGFR < 30 ml/min/1.73 m2
, then MMF may be used to
avoid CNI nephrotoxicity. CsA was not superior in achieving
remission when compared with MMF in combination with
dexamethasone (45% vs. 33%) [52]. When a child with
SRNS achieves remission following CNI therapy but subse￾quently has a steroid sensitive relapse, then based on RCTs
evaluating MMF in relapsing SSNS [22, 69, 70], MMF may
be used to maintain remission. The rationale to switch to a CNI￾free immunosuppressive protocol is to avoid long-term CNI
toxicity. A CNI-to-MMF conversion protocol was applied suc￾cessfully in children with SRNS after a mean of 1.7 years of
CNI therapy with regular drug monitoring [71]. However, in an
RCT conversion from TAC to MMF was shown to be inferior
to maintain remission in patients achieving remission by TAC
[57]. We suggest a MMF starting dose of 1200 mg/m2 per day,
and performing therapeutic drug monitoring in SRNS patients
aiming for a mycophenolic acid exposure (AUC) > 50 μg ×
h/ml based on the results in SSNS patients [22].
Repeat kidney biopsy
& If there is an unexplained drop in eGFR or increase in
proteinuria during follow-up, we suggest considering a
1542 Pediatr Nephrol (2020) 35:1529–1561

repeat kidney biopsy for assessment of CNI nephrotoxici￾ty (grade C, weak recommendation).
& We suggest considering a renal biopsy in those patients
who have prolonged CNI exposure (> 2 years) or when
being restarted on CNI-treatment for a second course
(grade C, weak recommendation).
Evidence and rationale
An unexplained eGFR decrease or an increase in proteinuria
may be due to disease progression or drug toxicity, especially
in patients on long-term CNI treatment. The latter is supported
in the presence of arteriolar hyalinization and smooth muscle
vacuolization, ischemic glomerular collapse, juxtaglomerular
apparatus hyperplasia, (striped) interstitial fibrosis and tubular
atrophy on light microscopy, and mitochondrial damage on
transmission electron microscopy [72].
Co-intervention with glucocorticoids
& We do not recommend prolonged (> 6 months) routine
PDN treatment in conjunction with CNI and RAASi
(grade C, moderate recommendation)
& We suggest tapering PDN after CNI initiation as follows:
40 mg/m2 QOD for 4 weeks, 30 mg/m2 QOD for 4 weeks,
20 mg/m2 QOD for 4 weeks, 10 mg/m2 QOD for 8 weeks,
and discontinuing thereafter (grade D, weak
recommendation).
Evidence and rationale
Prednisone was used as a co-intervention in several RCTs [52,
53, 55, 56]. The dose and duration of PDN ranged from
1 mg/kg/day for 6 months QOD to 0.3 mg/kg/day for
6 months. There is no evidence that prolonged treatment with
oral PDN is beneficial in SRNS patients but may cause steroid
toxicity; therefore, we suggest a gradual reduction of PDN
using the regimen suggested above, [73, 74]. PDN may be
weaned off more quickly especially in patients presenting with
glucocorticoid toxicity. However, this does not apply to a pro￾portion of SRNS patients who achieve complete remission
with CNI and subsequently behave as SDNS patients. These
patients may be treated accordingly with additional low-dose
alternate day oral PDN.
Second-line approaches
& Patients with SRNS who fail to achieve at least partial
remission with CNIs (and who do not have genetic or
syndromic disease) should be approached for participation
in a clinical trial evaluating novel potential therapies for
SRNS (ungraded).
& If a clinical trial is not available, the use of rituximab may
be considered (grade C, weak recommendation).
& We suggest administering two rituximab infusions at a
dose of 375 mg/m2 per infusion in order to reduce the
CD19 cell count below 5 per microliter or 1% (usually
1–2 infusions within 2 weeks) (grade C, weak
recommendation).
& Rituximab should not be given in the presence of tuber￾culosis, hepatitis B, or JC virus infections. In case of clin￾ical suspicion and endemic background, patients should
undergo screening by a chest X-ray, tuberculosis skin or
blood test, HBs-Ag serology in case of elevated liver en￾zymes, and spinal fluid examination in case of neurolog￾ical symptoms suggesting JC virus infection before com￾mencing rituximab (grade X, strong recommendation).
& In rituximab-resistant or rituximab-intolerant patients, the
use of ofatumumab and extracorporeal blood purification
therapies such as plasma exchange, immunoadsorption, or
lipid apheresis may be considered (grade C, weak
recommendation)
Evidence and rationale
Observational studies showed complete remissions in ~ 30%
of patients treated with rituximab as a rescue therapy for
multidrug-resistant SRNS [75–85]. However, rituximab was
not superior compared with treatment protocols including
plasma exchange and immunoadsorption [85]. In most stud￾ies, patients with multidrug-resistant SRNS received rituxi￾mab at a dose of 375 mg/m2 per infusion, and 1–2 infusions
over 2 weeks were usually sufficient to reduce the CD19 cell
count below 5 per microliter or 1% of lymphocyte count. In
patients achieving partial or complete remission, first-AM
proteinuria and B cell counts should be monitored and a sec￾ond course of rituximab be administered when proteinuria
increases substantially after B cell reconstitution (CD19 cell
count > 5 per microliter or 1% of lymphocyte count).
Contraindications for rituximab include hepatitis B, tubercu￾losis, or JC virus infections. Cotrimoxazole prophylaxis and
completion of age appropriate vaccination schedule is recom￾mended (see sections Antibiotic prophylaxis and
Vaccination). Serum levels of IgG should be monitored after
rituximab treatment as they were found to be low in ~ 30% of
patients [86, 87].
In several small pediatric studies, rituximab-resistant or
rituximab-intolerant cases as well as patients without rituxi￾mab pretreatment reportedly underwent complete remission
with the alternative CD20 cell-depleting agent ofatumumab
Pediatr Nephrol (2020) 35:1529–1561 1543

[88–90]. Ofatumumab was administered in two studies at an
initial dose of 300 mg/1.73 m2 (max 300 mg) followed by 5
weekly doses of 2000 mg/1.73 m2 (max 2000 mg) [89, 90]
and in a single case report 750 mg/1.73 m2 [88].
Various pharmacological and extracorporeal therapies have
been applied experimentally in patients with multidrug resis￾tant SRNS. Partial or complete remission has been observed in
individual case reports or in a few cases within small series of
patients receiving plasmapheresis, plasma exchange,
immunoadsorption, lipid apheresis [91–93], the B7-1 inhibitor
abatacept [94–96], and oral galactose [97–99]. Inclusion of
patients in clinical trials testing these and other novel therapies
is strongly encouraged (ongoing studies are listed here: https://
kidneyhealthgateway.com/trials-research/).
Withdrawing immunosuppression in non-responsive patients
& We recommend that screening for all known
podocytopathy genes be offered to enable decisions on
further immunosuppression (grade X, strong
recommendation).
& We recommend counseling patients and parents regarding
the high risk of progression to ESKD in patients with
hereditary forms and/or multidrug-resistant SRNS (grade
X, strong recommendation).
& We recommend discontinuing ineffective immunosup￾pressive therapies, and continuing non￾immunosuppressive management, including RAASi and
other supportive measures (grade X, strong
recommendation).
& In patients with non-genetic disease, we suggest exploring
available options for novel therapies being assessed in
clinical trials (grade X, strong recommendation).
& In patients with inherited defects who have achieved
partial or complete remission with immunosuppression,
we suggest the following:
The genetic variant(s) should be reviewed to confirm
whether it is indeed pathogenic or likely pathogenic
(grade A, strong recommendation).
A decision to continue or discontinue immunosuppres￾sion should follow parental counseling regarding the an￾ticipated benefits of remission (symptomatic relief; po￾tentially lower risk of disease progression) versus the po￾tential risks (therapy related toxicity; infections) and cost
of therapy (grade A, strong recommendation).
Evidence and rationale
Non-response is associated with rapid progression to
ESKD [11, 100, 101]. In patients with genetic forms of
SRNS, low rates of complete (2.7–3.0%) or partial re￾sponse (10.8–16%) to immunosuppression were reported
[9, 11, 101, 102]. Patients with genetic forms of SRNS
progress to ESKD more often than those without inherited
defects (71–74% vs. 4–29%) and show shorter median
renal survival (45–48 months vs. 58–205 months) [11,
100–102]. Given the likelihood of harm versus benefit,
we suggest withdrawing immunosuppression in non￾responsive monogenic SRNS patients. In those with de￾fects in the COQ pathway, COQ10 supplementation may
be considered [103–105]. While the probability of re￾sponse to experimental therapies is low in patients with
multi-drug-resistant disease, therapy could be contemplat￾ed after direct counseling of patients and parents about the
low likelihood of benefit, and the possibility of toxicity
with such therapies [89, 91, 106–108].
Additional measures to reduce symptoms and control
edema
Salt
& We suggest that excessive salt intake should be avoided in
children with SRNS (Table S11) (grade C, weak
recommendation).
& When available, a dietician should provide advice to pa￾tients and families on suitable low-salt foods and on the
high-salt foods to avoid (grade D, weak recommendation).
Fluid
& We do not recommend routine fluid restriction in SRNS
patients (grade C, weak recommendation).
& We suggest a balanced fluid intake taking into account the
urine output, volume status, and serum sodium (grade C,
weak recommendation).
Diuretics
& We suggest considering treatment with loop diuretics
(e.g., furosemide) in patients with severe edema. In
patients with refractory edema, the addition of
metolazone, thiazides, or potassium sparing diuretics
may also be considered (grade C, moderate
recommendation).
& Diuretics should not be given to patients with signs of
intravascular volume depletion including prolonged cap￾illary refill time, tachycardia, hypotension, and oliguria
due to the risk of thrombosis and AKI (grade X, strong
recommendation).
1544 Pediatr Nephrol (2020) 35:1529–1561

Albumin infusions
& We suggest treating patients with refractory edema (peri￾cardial/pleural effusions, anasarca, genital edema) and/or
symptomatic hypovolemia or with prerenal crisis (oliguria
due to intravascular volume depletion) with human albu￾min infusions (grade C, moderate recommendation).
& We suggest a starting dose of 20–25% albumin of 0.5–
1 g/kg body weight given intravenously over a period of
4–8 h, and adding furosemide (1–2 mg/kg given i.v.) in the
middle and/or at the end of the infusion (grade C, weak
recommendation).
& Children receiving albumin infusions should initially be
monitored with blood pressure and heart rate measure￾ments every 30 min, and the infusion slowed or ceased if
they develop any symptoms suggestive of vascular over￾load (grade X, strong recommendation).
Protein
& There is insufficient evidence to recommend an increased
protein intake in SRNS patients (ungraded).
Evidence and rationale
Severe edema in NS may be associated with either intravas￾cular volume contraction (“underfilled patient”) or volume
expansion (“overfilled patient”) [109]. Therefore, all measures
should be tailored according to the degree of edema and in￾travascular volume status. Clinical indicators for intravascular
volume depletion are peripheral vasoconstriction (prolonged
capillary refill time), tachycardia, hypotension, and oliguria,
in the setting of urinary sodium retention (fractional sodium
excretion (FeNa) < 0.2%). In contrast, hypertension and a
FeNa > 0.2% would suggest an overfilled patient [110–112].
Salt
According to the “underfilled” and “overfilled” hypotheses
edema formation in idiopathic NS is thought to be associated
with salt retention and/or diminished excretion of salt [109].
Consequently, a strict dietary restriction of sodium intake <
2 mEq/kg/day (< 35 mg/kg/day) was proposed for children
with NS [110, 113, 114]. However, such a strong sodium
restriction seems not to be feasible in children and may not
be required in many patients. Therefore, instead of an upper
limit, we recommend avoiding excessive salt intake depend￾ing on the degree of edema (Supplementary Table S11). This
usually requires dietary advice—from a dietician.
Fluid
General restriction of fluids to two-thirds of maintenance have
been suggested in children with NS [7111]. However, this
may put patients, who already have intravascular volume de￾pletion (“underfilled patient”) despite the presence of concom￾itant edema, at risk for symptomatic hypovolemia. Therefore,
we do not recommend routine fluid restriction in SRNS pa￾tients. Instead, we suggest a balanced fluid intake taking into
account urine output, volume status, and serum sodium (low
serum sodium suggests fluid overload). Patients should avoid
salty foods, as they increase thirst (Supplementary Table S11).
Diuretics
Treatment of severe edema in children with NS with diuretics
alone is safe and effective in the presence of volume expansion
(“overfilled patient”) [113], whereas aggressive treatment with
diuretics carries the risk of intravascular hypovolemia, AKI,
and thrombosis in “underfilled patients” [115]. Therefore, we
suggest considering treatment with diuretics (preferably loop
diuretics) in patients with severe edema only when intravascu￾lar volume depletion has been excluded based on the
abovementioned clinical indicators. Combination therapy with
metolazone, thiazides, or potassium sparing diuretics including
the epithelial sodium channel blocker amiloride and the aldo￾sterone antagonist spironolactone can enhance diuresis as com￾pared with a loop diuretic alone and should be considered in
patients with refractory edema [116]. However, patients need to
be carefully monitored to avoid severe hypokalemia or
hyperkalemia, volume depletion and alkalosis [117–120].
Since furosemide has a short duration of action (t1/2 6 h) and
great variation in oral bioavailability (10–100%), it should be
administered at least twice daily as oral doses or intravenously
if the diuretic response is poor [121, 122].
Albumin infusions
Albumin infusions in combination with loop diuretics increase
diuresis via improved oncotic pressure and renal hemodynamics
in patients with severe refractory edema, especially when used in
“underfilled patients” [123–125]. However, they work only tran￾siently [126], and are associated with allergic reactions [127],
respiratory failure, and congestive heart failure, especially when
given too rapidly, used in “overfilled patients,” and patients with
oliguria [126]. Therefore, careful assessment of the patient’s in￾travascular volume status and urine output is mandatory [110].
Dosages up to 1 g/kg given as 20–25% albumin over a period of
at least 4 h are thought to be safe [128]. We suggest restricting
albumin infusions to patients with severe edema (pericardial/
pleural effusions, anasarca, genital edema), symptomatic hypo￾volemia, or with prerenal crisis. Adding furosemide in the middle
and/or at the end of the infusion enhances the diuretic response.
Pediatr Nephrol (2020) 35:1529–1561 1545

Protein intake
Hypoalbuminemia is associated with several complications in
SRNS including thrombosis and risk of AKI [115], but there is
no evidence that increased oral protein intake improves serum
albumin levels or patient outcome [129].
Recommendations for lifestyle
& We recommend supporting physical activity and a healthy
nutrition in children with SRNS and adapting to the pa￾tient’s ability and stage of CKD. We recommend advising
against smoking (grade C, moderate recommendation)
Evidence and rationale
Patients with SRNS have an increased risk for cardiovascular
disease [130] and impaired bone health [131, 132]. Therefore,
regular physical activity; refraining from smoking, vaping, or
substance use; and a healthy nutrition as in the general popu￾lation are recommended. Nutrition should be guided by a di￾etician allowing adequate energy intake and avoiding high salt
(vide supra) or phosphorus intake and adapted to the child’s
age or height age in short children, and stage of CKD [133,
134]. Eating home-prepared meals using fresh ingredients in￾stead of canned, frozen, or packaged meals are preferred
(Table S11), since the latter has a much higher content of salt
and inorganic phosphorus which is up to 100% absorbed by
the intestine [134].
Monitoring and management of complications of NS
and side effects of medications
Monitoring of complications
& We recommend monitoring for complications of the per￾sistent NS and medication side effects (see Table 4) (grade
B, moderate recommendation).
Evidence and rationale
Disease-related complications include infections,
hypogammaglobulinemia, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, hy￾pothyroidism, venous thromboembolism, vitamin D deficien￾cy, growth failure, obesity, malnutrition, AKI, and CKD.
Potential side effects of medications are shown in Table 4,
and primary outcome parameters for use in registries/studies
are shown in Supplementary Table S9.
Interventions—prevention and treatment
Hypogammaglobulinemia—immunoglobulin substitution
& We suggest that immunoglobulin substitution be consid￾ered in cases of low serum IgG levels AND recurrent and/
or severe infections (grade D, weak recommendation).
Evidence and rationale
Arguments against routine IgG substitution in patients with
low IgG include (a) the rapid urinary loss following infusion,
(b) commercial immunoglobulin preparations contain low
IgG titers against bacteria mainly responsible for the septic
episodes (staphylococci, streptococci, gram-negative bacteria)
[135], and (c) the high costs. We thus suggest considering
prophylactic IgG substitution as in other cases of secondary
hypogammaglobulinemia in patients presenting with recurrent
and/or severe infections [136].
Antibiotic prophylaxis
& We do not recommend routine antibiotic prophylaxis in
children with SRNS (grade C, weak recommendation).
& We suggest antibiotic prophylaxis with cotrimoxazole
in patients treated with rituximab for a period of 3 up-to
6 months depending on B cell recovery and immuno￾suppressive co-medi cation (grade C, weak
recommendation).
Evidence and rationale
Although 60% of NS-associated deaths are attributable to
infection [137], there is no evidence to recommend antibi￾otic prophylaxis in children with SRNS [138–142]. Thirty
to 50% of infections were due to pneumococcal infection,
with the rest are due to gram-negative bacilli principally
E. coli [2, 114, 137, 143–146]. It was estimated that 110
children would need to be treated for 1 year to prevent 1
pneumococcal peritonitis [147]. Given the high mortality
of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, we suggest to ad￾minister cotrimoxazole in patients on rituximab therapy
for a period of 3 up to 6 months depending on B cell
recovery and use of additional immunosuppressive co￾medications [75]. Prophylactic cotrimoxazole dosing is
recommend with 5–10 mg TMP/kg/day or 150 mg TMP/
m2
/day in infants (at least 4 weeks of age) and children,
given as single daily dose or in two divided doses every
12 h 3 times weekly (on consecutive or alternate days) with
1546 Pediatr Nephrol (2020) 35:1529–1561

a maximum TMP dose of 320 mg/day [148]. The oral dos￾ing in adolescents is 80 to 160 mg TMP daily or 160 mg
TMP 3 times per week [149]. Whereas a 50% dose reduc￾tion of cotrimoxazole is required when eGFR < 30 ml/m2
/
min, use of cotrimoxazole is not recommend with eGFR <
15 ml/m2
/min. In those cases, an alternative option may be
prophylactic aerosolized pentamidin, but there is insuffi￾cient evidence in the efficacy.
Vaccination
& We recommend reviewing the child’s vaccination status at
disease onset and completing all vaccinations without de￾lay, especially for encapsulated bacteria (pneumococcal,
meningococcal, Haemophilus influenzae) and, if possible,
varicella-zoster virus (grade A, strong recommendation).
& We suggest administering inactivated influenza vaccine
annually (grade A, strong recommendation).
& We recommend following national vaccination guidelines
for the administration of inactive and live attenuated vac￾cines in immunocompromised patients (grade A, strong
recommendation)
& Live vaccines should not be given in SRNS patients on
daily immunosuppressive medication including CNIs,
MMF, and PDN (grade X, strong recommendation).
Prevention of varicella infection
& We recommend treating susceptible patients (i.e., those
not or inadequately immunized to varicella and exposed
to chickenpox) with varicella-zoster immunoglobulin
(VZIG) (grade A, strong recommendation).
& If VZIG is not available, we suggest treatment with oral
acyclovir (10 mg/kg QID for 7 days) within 7–10 days of
exposure (grade C, moderate recommendation).
& We recommend varicella vaccine should be administered
to unimmunized patients in remission and not on immu￾nosuppressive medications (grade A, strong
recommendation).
Evidence and rationale
Varicella infection can be life threatening in children with
SRNS. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) ap￾proved VZIG for reducing chickenpox symptoms in sus￾ceptible patients, i.e., those not immunized and having no
history of chickenpox [150]. VZIG should be given as
soon as possible up to 10 days post-exposure [151–154].
Unfortunately, VZIG is not readily available in most coun￾tries. Two small studies in 52 immuno-competent children
and one in 8 children with renal disease on corticosteroids
suggest that administration of acyclovir reduces the risk of
chickenpox when given within 7–10 days after exposure
and continued for 7 days [155–157]. Once in remission and
not on immunosuppressive medications, varicella vaccine
should be administered in unimmunized patients and fam￾ily members.
Prevention of thrombosis
& We recommend mobilizing patients as much as possible
and not placing central venous lines, except for a specific
and transient need (grade X, strong recommendation).
& There is insufficient evidence to recommend routine pro￾phylactic anticoagulation for children with SRNS and
with no prior history or risk of thrombosis (ungraded).
& We suggest preventive anticoagulation with low molecu￾lar weight heparin or oral anticoagulants in those patients
with a previous history of venous thromboembolic events,
and consideration of treatment for those with additional
risk factors (indwelling central venous lines, known he￾reditary thrombophilic predisposition, acute illnesses with
hospitalization, infection or risk of dehydration) (grade C,
weak recommendation).
& We suggest thrombophilic screening in SRNS patients
with additional risk factors including central venous lines,
persistent nephrotic range proteinuria, and positive family
history for thrombophilic predisposition (Table 2) (grade
C, weak recommendation).
Evidence and rationale
A 3% incidence of thromboembolic events has been re￾ported in children with NS (summarized in [158–160].
Risk factors include disease-related hypercoagulability,
underlying thrombophilic predisposition, infections
[161], and treatment, e.g., central venous lines. In all
SRNS children, baseline coagulation tests (stated in
Table 2) should be performed during the initial workup.
We suggest extending the thrombophilic screening in pa￾tients with high-risk (previous thrombotic events or
known hereditary thrombotic predisposition) by screening
for hereditary deficiencies of anticoagulant proteins (e.g.,
protein C, protein S, and antithrombin) and single￾nucleotide polymorphisms in the prothrombin (factor II
G20210A) and factor V genes (factor V G1691A). We
also suggest considering preventive anticoagulation with
low-molecular weight heparin in SRNS patients at high
thrombotic risk for the short term, with vitamin K antag￾onists for the long term [158].
Pediatr Nephrol (2020) 35:1529–1561 1547

Treatment of hyper- or dyslipidemia
& We suggest considering age-dependent lipid-lowering
treatment in children with persistent multidrug-resistant
NS and persistently high fasting LDL-cholesterol (>
130 mg/dl; > 3.4 mmol/l) (grade C, weak
recommendation).
Evidence and rationale
Prolonged hyper-/dyslipidemia complicates persistent NS and
is a risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity, but data to guide
antihyperlipidemic treatment in children are scarce [162–166].
Uncontrolled studies in children with NS showed a reduction
in LDL and total cholesterol levels by 30–40% using a com￾bination of statins and lifestyle changes, but a RCT in children
with SRNS showed no significant reduction in lipid levels
[167–169]. Given the high cardiovascular morbidity associat￾ed with dyslipidemia, we suggest considering lipid-lowering
treatment in children with SRNS and persistent LDL￾cholesterol levels > 130 mg/dl (3.4 mmol/l), starting with life￾style changes, including dietary modifications, enhanced
physical activity and weight control [166]. There is no evi￾dence to recommend the use of lipid-lowering statins in NS.
Some experts suggest considering statins when fasting LDL￾cholesterol is persistently > 160 mg/dl (4.1 mmol/l) [140, 170]
or earlier (> 130 mg/dl (3.4 mmol/l)), in case of additional
cardiovascular risk factors [166].
Calcium, magnesium, and vitamin D supplementations
& We suggest administering oral calcium if hypocalcemia
exists based on ionized and/or albumin-corrected calcium
levels (grade C, weak recommendation).
& We suggest supplementing with cholecalciferol or
ergocalciferol if 25-OH-vitamin D levels are low (< 30
ng/mL) (grade C, moderate recommendation).
& We suggest administering oral magnesium in case of
symptomatic hypomagnesemia (grade D, weak
recommendation).
Evidence and rationale
Children with SRNS have urinary losses of vitamin-D binding
protein and 25-dihydroxyvitamin D and may develop vitamin
D deficiency leading to hypocalcemia, hyperparathyroidism,
and impaired bone mineralization [171]. Vitamin D supple￾mentation in these patients is effective [172–174], and recom￾mended as in other CKD patients [175]. CNI treatment may
cause hypomagnesemia causing leg cramps. Administering
oral magnesium will avoid symptomatic hypomagnesemic
episodes.
Thyroid hormone replacement
& We recommend substituting levothyroxine (T4) in case of
hypothyroidism (grade A, strong recommendation).
Evidence and rationale
Hypothyroidism in children with SRNS is a result of urinary loss
of thyroxine-binding proteins [176, 177]. Therefore, TSH and
free T4 levels should be regularly monitored in patients with
persistently high-grade proteinuria (Table 2) [178, 179]. For
those children with TSH levels > 10 mU/l and low free T4, we
recommend treating with levothyroxine (T4) [180]. In asymp￾tomatic children with TSH elevations of 4.5–10 mU/l and nor￾mal free T4, thyroid function can be monitored periodically and
the indication for treatment re-evaluated [177, 180, 181].
Treatment of hypertension and CKD-associated complications
& We recommend treatment of hypertension and CKD￾associated complications such as anemia, metabolic aci￾dosis, and hyperparathyroidism, according to current
guidelines (grade A, strong recommendation).
Evidence and rationale
Children with SRNS have a significantly increased risk for
cardiovascular disease [130, 132]. As in any child with
CKD, high blood pressure (> 95th age-sex and height specific
percentile) should be treated aiming for blood pressure values
< 75th percentile in children without proteinuria, and < 50th
percentile in children with proteinuria [182, 183]. Other CKD￾associated complications should be treated according to cur￾rent guidelines [133, 175, 184].
Diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of relapsing
SRNS in native kidneys
Prevention of relapse
& No clinical or histological parameters at initial clinical
presentation are available to predict relapsing SRNS
(ungraded).
1548 Pediatr Nephrol (2020) 35:1529–1561

Evidence and rationale
It is unknown to what degree medications should be tapered
or discontinued once remission is achieved [53, 71].
Relapse occurred in up to 70% of those responding to
CNI therapy after discontinuation at 6 or 12 months. We
recommend continuing immunosuppressive therapy with
CNI or MMF after remission over a period of at least 1 year
[6, 57]. Gradual reduction of CNI/MMF instead of abrupt
stopping may prevent an early relapse [50].
Treatment of relapse
Relapse on CNI treatment
& We recommend adherence to CNIs be monitored using
serum trough levels according to the monitoring schedule
shown in Table 2 (grade C, moderate recommendation)
& We suggest administering oral PDN 60 mg/m2 daily until
remission is achieved or for a maximum period of 4 weeks,
with subsequent taper when remission is achieved (grade
C, weak recommendation).
& In case of no response, frequent relapses, or side effects of
medications, we recommend following the refractory
SRNS protocol (see “Second-line approaches”)
(ungraded).
Relapse post withdrawal of immunosuppressive treatment
& We suggest giving oral PDN (60 mg/m2 daily) until remis￾sion is achieved orfor a maximum period of 4 weeks, with
subsequent taper when remission is achieved.
Alternatively, we suggest restarting the immunosuppres￾sive agent, which was able to prevent, relapses (grade D,
weak recommendation).
& In cases of no complete response within 4 weeks, frequent
relapses or side effects of medications, we recommend
following the refractory SRNS protocol (see “Second-line
approaches”) (ungraded).
Evidence and rationale
Relapsing SRNS and role of steroids
Several studies have shown the effectiveness of PDN in
relapsing SRNS at 2 mg/kg/day to induce remission [52,
53] with a change to QOD PDN, followed by tapering until
the end of month 6 [185, 186]. Intravenous MPDN was also
effective in inducing remission in relapsing patients [71,
74, 187]. Re-starting non-glucocorticoid medications
which were effective in the particular patient is also
reasonable.
Management of children with ESKD
Dialyzed patients
& We recommend that urine protein excretion should be
measured prior to transplantation in patients with residual
native kidney function to facilitate accurate post￾transplant surveillance for recurrence (grade A, strong
recommendation).
& We recommend that the anticipated recurrence risk after
renal transplantation should be discussed with the family
in renal replacement therapy planning (grade A, strong
recommendation).
& If transplant will occur before resolution of NS in the
setting of ESKD, we suggest considering medical or sur￾gical nephrectomies prior to transplantation (grade D,
weak recommendation).
Evidence and rationale
Preparation for transplantation ideally requires the resolu￾tion of NS to minimize the risk for venous thromboem￾bolism and improve the accuracy of monitoring for post￾transplant recurrence. If adequate resolution of proteinuria
does not occur after the initiation of dialysis based on
24-h urine protein, we suggest considering medical or
surgical nephrectomies. However, the benefits of residual
kidney function and urine output in facilitating dialysis
should also be considered.
Selection of transplant recipients
& We recommend that genetic testing be performed before
transplantation to inform SRNS recurrence risk (grade B,
moderate recommendation).
& We recommend kidney transplant be offered to children
with ESKD secondary to SRNS regardless of genetic or
non-genetic cause of SRNS (grade B, moderate
recommendation).
& We suggest that the risks and benefits of a repeat
transplant in a patient with a history of SRNS recur￾rence should be discussed within the transplant team
and with the patient and family in planning for a
repeat-transplant (grade A, strong recommendation).
Pediatr Nephrol (2020) 35:1529–1561 1549

Evidence and rationale
Factors associated with post-transplant recurrence of SRNS
are non-genetic vs. monogenic forms of SRNS (recurrence
24% vs. 0% in Brazilian cohort [188] and 50% vs. 7% in
European cohort [101]; initial steroid resistance vs. sensitivity
(OR 30, 95% CI 6.6–135.9) [189]; time to ESKD < 48 vs. >
48 months (OR 11.7, 95% CI 1.53 – 89.1) and
glomerulosclerosis percentage < 55% at renal biopsy (OR
16, 95% CI 1.45–1.76) [190]. Children with a history of
SRNS recurrence in a prior transplant have a > 80% likelihood
of recurrence in a subsequent transplant [188]. Complete and
partial remission has been reported in 63% and 8% of patients
with recurrent NS post-transplant with a 10 years allograft
survival of 50% [191, 192].
Selection of transplant donors
& We recommend candidate living-related allograft donors
undergo genetic testing as part of evaluation in the setting
of genetic SRNS if available (grade X, strong
recommendation).
& We recommend a donor candidate with a pathogenic or
likely pathogenic variant in a dominant gene, with or with￾out symptoms, be excluded as a potential donor (grade X,
strong recommendation).
& A heterozygous carrier of a recessive SRNS genetic vari￾ant may be considered a potential donor, after genetic
counseling (except for carriers of pathological variations
in COL4A5, COL4A3, and COL4A4) (grade C, weak
recommendation).
& An asymptomatic carrier of a variant of unknown signifi￾cance may be considered as a transplant donor following
extensive evaluation and counseling where other organ
donation options are not available (grade C, weak
recommendation).
& We recommend that the expected risk of recurrence and
premature allograft failure be included in the consideration
of donor candidacy (grade A, strong recommendation).
Evidence and rationale
Living-related kidney donation in the context of genetic kid￾ney diseases should follow detailed donor evaluation, careful
review of pattern of disease inheritance, and genetic counsel￾ing and testing [193, 194]. While a family history of a genetic
kidney disease with an autosomal recessive (AR) mode of
inheritance is not considered a contraindication for living kid￾ney donation, long-term follow-up data are lacking [193]. In
cases where SRNS follows an autosomal dominant (AD)
mode of inheritance, donation from living related donors from
the side of family with affected members is discouraged. If it
remains uncertain whether the donor candidate has a genetic
kidney disease and whether the disease can cause CKD, do￾nation should proceed only after informing the donor candi￾date of the risks of donation if the disease manifests later in life
[193, 194].
Hemizygous carriers (mothers and sisters) of COL4A5 de￾fects should be dissuaded from kidney donation, since they are
known to develop ESKD [195]. Similar advice should be
given to donors with pathogenic heterozygous defects in other
COL4A (COL4A3 and COL4A4). Further, the risk to donors
carrying heterozygous NPHS2 mutations may be modified by
variants such as R229Q, which are considered to have a
dominant-negative variant that might theoretically pose risk
to the donor [196, 197]. Tests including evaluation of protein￾uria and hematuria done as part of the donor assessment
should be interpreted with special consideration in the setting
of familial SRNS. If genetic evaluation of the potential donor
is normal but the family history is positive, donation should
proceed only after a full informed consent.
Accepting living donor for kidney transplantation in view of
risk of recurrence
& Either living related or deceased donors are encouraged
for patients with non-genetic SRNS receiving their first
allograft (grade B, moderate recommendation).
Evidence and rationale
Similar proportions of patients with recurrence were observed
among living versus deceased allografts (10–50% vs. 3–45%),
but allograft survival was superior in living donor allografts
with recurrent FSGS compared with deceased donor allografts
[198–200].
Withholding transplantation from patients who have previ￾ously recurred
& We recommend, discouraging living related donation for
recipients who have had disease recurrence in the first
transplant (grade B, moderate recommendation).
& Deceased donor transplant may be offered to potential
recipients with a history of prior allograft loss to recur￾rence of NS, particularly if dialysis is difficult to sustain,
or associated with life-threatening events, serious infec￾tions, poor growth, and/or low quality of life (grade C,
weak recommendation).

Evidence and rationale
Transplantation should not be delayed in SRNS patients, since
this does not reduce the recurrence risk [200–204].
Recurrence in first allograft indicates a 60–80% risk of recur￾rence in subsequent allografts [199, 203, 204]. Strategies used
to manage recurrent disease (high-dose CNI, intravenous
MPDN, rituximab; and extracorporeal therapies) induced re￾mission in ~ 60% of cases [200, 205, 206]. While a few re￾ports suggest that early diagnosis and aggressive therapy of
recurrent disease may result in outcomes comparable to those
in allografts without recurrence [207, 208], outcomes after
recurrence are usually poor for patients who do not respond
to interventions [209–214]. Therefore, repeat transplants from
living donors are discouraged in the setting of prior SRNS
disease recurrence and deceased donor transplantation, rather
than dialysis, is considered ethically appropriate.
Prevention of recurrence after renal transplantation
& There is insufficient evidence to recommend intervention
strategies for the prevention of recurrence in children un￾dergoing a first kidney transplant (ungraded).
& We suggest prophylactic plasmapheresis or
immunoadsorption or lipid apheresis and perioperative ri￾tuximab for use in children with a history of allograft loss
due to NS recurrence in a prior transplant (grade C, weak
recommendation).
Evidence and rationale
There are no proven preventative strategies to reduce the like￾lihood of recurrence in SRNS patients undergoing the first
renal transplantation. Preventative strategies for SRNS recur￾rence in primary, non-genetic SRNS with a history of SRNS
recurrence within 1 year of transplant were shown to be effec￾tive in case reports and small series including 8 patients. They
include prophylactic plasmapheresis three times weekly for
2 weeks, beginning 1 week prior to living donor transplant
or within 1 day of deceased donor transplant with 1.5 plasma
volume exchanges and rituximab peri-operatively or immedi￾ately after transplant with/or without a second dose post￾transplant day 7 [93, 215–217].
Transplant recurrence (as defined in Table 1)
& We recommend surveillance for recurrence beginning on
the day of kidney transplantation by monitoring UPCR,
continued daily throughout the initial transplant hospital￾ization, and then continued periodically (e.g., weekly for
4 weeks, monthly for 1 year, then quarterly thereafter)
(grade C, moderate recommendation).
& We suggest in a previously anuric patient, post-transplant
UPCR ≥ 100 mg/mmol (1 mg/mg) may be indicative of
early recurrence, infection, or other diagnoses and requires
evaluation (grade C, weak recommendation).
& We suggest in a patient with prevalent proteinuria at the
time of transplant, an increase of UPCR ≥ 100 mg/mmol
(1 mg/mg) may be indicative of early recurrence, infection
or other diagnoses and requires evaluation (grade C, weak
recommendation).
& We suggest that early onset acute tubular necrosis (ATN)
or graft non-function/dysfunction should be regarded as
first signs of recurrence (grade C, weak recommendation).
& We suggest that an allograft biopsy is not required to di￾agnose rapid recurrence of NS as defined in Table 1, but
allograft biopsy is recommended for the exclusion of dif￾ferential diagnosis in the setting of subnephrotic protein￾uria, recurrence after 48 h, or in the setting of delayed graft
function (grade B, moderate recommendation).
& We suggest that a diagnostic evaluation precede adjust￾ments of immunosuppression therapy in the setting of late
NS recurrence (> 3 months post-transplant) including as￾sessment of infection, donor-specific antibodies serol￾ogies, and histopathology including electron microscopy
(grade B, moderate recommendation).
Evidence and rationale
Nephrotic syndrome may recur as early as within 24 h after
transplantation and is indicated by a UPCR ratio ≥ 100 mg/
mmol (1 mg/mg) in a previously anuric patient (Table 1).
Early onset acute tubular necrosis (ATN) or graft non-func￾tion/dysfunction should be considered as a first sign of trans￾plant recurrence [218, 219]. A diagnosis of FSGS recurrence
can be inferred on renal biopsy with diffuse foot process efface￾ment in the absence of other histopathological findings, even if
the glomerular scar defining FSGS is not present. Late-onset or
insidious proteinuria requires a renal biopsy for the exclusion of
the differential diagnoses including de novo TMA and
antibody-mediated rejection with transplant glomerulopathy,
since both can show secondary FSGS [191, 220–222].
Treatment of recurrence
& We recommend implementing NS recurrence-specific
therapy as soon as possible after diagnosis is established
(grade X, strong recommendation).
& We suggest applying increasing doses of CNI, intravenous
MPDN pulses, and/or plasmapheresis (or
Pediatr Nephrol (2020) 35:1529–1561 1551

immunoadsorption) with or without rituximab (grade C,
weak recommendation).
& We suggest initiating RAASi when no complete remission
is achieved following recurrence targeted therapy (grade
C, weak recommendation).
Evidence and rationale
Strategies used to manage recurrent disease including
high-dose CNI, intravenous MPDN, rituximab, and extra￾corporeal blood purification induced remission in ~ 60%
of transplant recurrence [198, 223]. We suggest in pa￾tients, treated with rituximab, to administer a second dose
of rituximab (375 mg/m2
) in the setting of incomplete B
cell depletion and/or recurrence of proteinuria.
