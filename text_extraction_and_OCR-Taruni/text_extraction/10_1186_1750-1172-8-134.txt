Abstract
Background: Mucopolysaccharidosis VI (MPS VI) is an autosomal recessive progressive multiorgan disorder due to
mutation in the gene encoding the enzyme Arylsulfatase B (ARSB). Dysfunctional ARSB causes lysosomal
accumulation of glycosaminoglycans (GAG). Currently, enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) is preferred to
hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (SCT) due to the treatment-related risks of the latter. However, ERT
constitutes an expensive life-long treatment. Increased experience and safety of SCT-procedures in recent years
suggest that SCT should be further explored as a treatment option.
This is the first report on haploidentical SCT in patients with MPS VI. The primary objective was to assess the
treatment safety and clinical and biochemical outcome.
Patients and methods: Two siblings diagnosed with MPS VI at 10 months of age and at birth with genotype p.
C192R, reported as mild to intermediate phenotype, underwent unrelated umbilical cord blood transplantation
pre-symptomatic. Due to graft failure, both patients were urgently re-transplantated with haploidentical SCT with
the father as donor. Continuous clinical and biochemical status was monitored and concluded 3.8 and 4.6 years
after the haploidentical SCT.
Results: Haploidentical SCT resulted in prompt and sustained engraftment. Complete donor chimerism was
achieved in both patients, apart from mixed B cells chimerism in patient 2. ARSB activity in leukocytes post
transplant increased from 0.0 to 19.0 μkat/kg protein (patient 1) and from 3.6 to 17.9 μkat/kg protein (patient 2)
(ref. 17–40). Total urinary GAG normalized in both patients, although patient 2’s values slightly exceed normal range
since 6 months. However, dermatan sulfaturia was substantially normalized since 16 months and 12 months post￾SCT, respectively. Height was −1.85 SD and −1.27 SD at follow-up. Patient 1 had impaired visual acuity and discrete
hepatomegaly. Patient 2 had elevated intraocular pressure and X-ray revealed steep acetabular angles and slightly
flattened lumbar vertebrae.
Conclusion: This study demonstrates that young children with MPS VI tolerate haploidentical SCT. Normalization of
enzyme production and dermatan sulfaturia indicates correction of the inborn error of metabolism and coincide
with no obvious symptoms of progressive MPS VI up to 4.6 years post-SCT.

Background
Mucopolysaccharidosis type VI (MPS VI; Maroteaux-Lamy
syndrome; MIM ID #253200) is an autosomal recessive
lysosomal storage disorder, caused by mutations in the gene
encoding arylsulfatase B (ARSB; N-acetylgalactosamine 4-
sulfatase) [1]. ARSB is required for the degradation of the
glycosaminoglycan (GAG) dermatan sulfate (DS), and the
related GAG chondroitin sulfate [2]. ARSB-deficiency will
ultimately lead to accumulation of these GAGs and their
excretion in the urine [3,4].
The incidence of MPS VI varies greatly depending on
ethnicity; from 1 in 38 563 live births among Turkish immi￾grants in Germany to 1 in 1 428 571 in Sweden [5,6].
Clinical presentation and course
The great variety of clinical features usually includes short
stature, hepatosplenomegaly, cardiac valve abnormalities,
coarse facial features, joint contractures, hearing loss, upper
airway obstruction, and claw-hand deformities [2,7-9]. Fur￾ther skeletal abnormalities are hip and femoral head dyspla￾sia and flattening of the vertebral bodies of the spine [10].
Visual impairments such as hypermetropia, high intraocu￾lar pressure, and glaucoma are common features [2,10],
and essentially all MPS VI patients have some degree of
corneal clouding [8,11]. In contrast to some other MPS
disorders, the MPS VI patients are most often intellec￾tually intact [2,7].
MPS VI patients can be sub-divided based on clinical fea￾tures and age at onset of symptoms into mild, intermediate,
or severe [12-15] and rapidly or slowly progressing [1-3].
The severe phenotype (rapidly progressing) manifests most
often before 3 years of age, and the patients rarely grow
taller than 120 cm [3]. If the disease remains untreated,
death usually occurs by 2nd or 3rd decade of life, mainly
due to heart failure or infections. Patients with slowly
progressing MPS VI may remain undiagnosed until late
teens or adulthood [2]. They have a longer life expectancy,
often into the 5th or 6th decade of life [16] and reach near
normal/normal height with mild skeletal and facial deform￾ities. However, similar to the aggressive form they subse￾quently develop severe morbidity [3,13].
Molecular genetics
Currently, 146 disease-causing ARSB mutations are identi￾fied in The Human Gene Mutation Database. The major￾ities are missense and nonsense mutations, the rest are
deletions, insertions, splicing, and rearrangement mutations
[2,4,15]. In general, truncating nonsense mutations and de￾letions together with missense mutations that directly affect
the active site of the ARSB enzyme cause a more severe dis￾ease [4,15]. Due to the small number of MPS VI patients
relative to the rather large number of mutations, genotype￾phenotype predictions have been difficult to perform
[4]. The homozygous missense mutation in the two
patients described here, p.C192R, has been associated
with a mild [12] or an intermediate severity [15], or a
slowly progressing disease [13].
Diagnostics of MPS VI
Early diagnosis and treatment in addition to progression
rate are the most important prognostic factors [2,17,18].
Clinical suspicion of any type of MPS should immedi￾ately trigger qualitative and quantitative analyses of the
uGAG, considering uGAG varies with age [19]. uGAG
alone is not sensitive enough to dismiss the diagnosis if
suspicion is high and, therefore, the current recommen￾dations for diagnostic tests for MPS VI include enzyme
activity of ARSB in leukocytes and/or fibroblasts and
mutation analysis of the ARSB gene [2,17,19].
Therapeutic alternatives
The current therapeutic options, in addition to symp￾tomatic treatment, are enzyme replacement therapy
(ERT) and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation
(SCT) [2,10,18]. The potential benefits of both thera￾peutic options include improvements in clinical status
and stabilization and/or delay of disease progression
[18].
The primary aim of this paper was to report the clin￾ical outcome of two siblings diagnosed with MPS VI
who following unsuccessful umbilical cord blood trans￾plantation (UCBT) were rescued with haploidentical
stem cell transplantation (haplo-SCT). This is, to the
best of our knowledge, the first report on haplo-SCT in
MPS VI patients.
Methods
Diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up was done at the
Pediatric Oncology and Pediatric Endocrinology Units at
Skåne University Hospital in Lund, Sweden. Examina￾tions performed pre-transplant and at follow-up were:
length/height, weight, and head circumference compared
to WHO child growth standards, audiogram, ophthal￾mological examination (including Hooper Vision
Organization Test, corneal examination and tonometry),
echocardiography, standard 12-lead electrocardiogram,
abdominal ultrasound, radiology (hand, hip and spine),
articular examination, teeth-mouth status, as well as a
detailed neurological examination. Photographic images
of the patients were taken for documentation at assess￾ment. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and
spinal cord were performed before transplantation and
revealed no signs of disease specific pathology. The
standard 6-minute walk test (6MWT) could not be
performed due to cooperative problems. However, the
patients were observed during a 6-minute walk with
their parents, a distance of 420 meters. Height of both
parents was measured.

uGAG measurements and ARSB-activity were carried
out at the Department of Laboratory Medicine/Clinical
Chemistry, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Gothenburg,
Sweden. The mutation analysis was performed at
Departement de Genética, Facultat de Biologia, Barcelona
and at Skåne University Hospital, Lund, Sweden. Quanti￾tative and qualitative uGAG-analyses were performed at
the time of diagnosis, before the transplantations, one year
post transplant, and then 2–4 times annually. The uGAG
values were assessed in relation to the age-dependent nor￾mal reference ranges (ref.). ARSB activity in fibroblasts
(ref. 40–90 μkat/kg protein) and leukocytes (ref. 17–40
μkat/kg protein) was measured at the time of diagnosis,
thereafter in leukocytes 4 weeks after the haplo-SCT, 2–3
times annually for 3 years, and then annually.
Chimerism analysis was performed at regular intervals
by amplification of variable number of tandem repeats
as polymorphic genetic markers in selected cell popula￾tions (T- and B lymphocytes and myeloid cells). Im￾munological recovery was assessed by serology and
lymphocyte distribution in peripheral blood.
UCBT
After confirmed diagnosis of MPS VI, international
expertise recommended SCT. The patients received un￾related UCBT, as no HLA-matched donor could be iden￾tified. Donor search and identification was carried out
by the national Swedish Stem Cells Donor Registry
at Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.
Both patients received myeloablative conditioning regi￾men consisting of busulfan without therapeutic drug
monitoring (1.2 mg/kg iv every 6 hours for 16 doses on
days −10 through −6), cyclophosphamide (50 mg/kg
iv daily from day −5 through −2), and rabbit anti￾thymocyteglobulin (thymoglobuline 2.5 mg/kg daily
from day −3 through day −1). Ciclosporin and methyl￾prednisolone were given as GvHD prophylaxis.
Details regarding the UCBT including cell doses are
shown in Table 1.
Haplo-SCT
Both children experienced graft failure and, after con￾sultation with EBMT (European Group for Blood and
Marrow Transplantation), they were rescued with haplo￾SCT 54 and 59 days after UCBT. Patient 1 (Pat1) under￾went reconditioning with fludarabine (25 mg/m2 daily
from day −4 through −1) and etoposide (10 mg/kg on
day −1). Patient 2 (Pat2) was reconditioned with a more
intensive regimen containing fludarabine (40 g/m2 daily
from day −7 through −4), thiotepa (5 mg/kg on day −3),
and melphalan (120 mg/m2 on day −2).
As rejection prophylaxis CD3 antibody muromonab
was administered on days −8 to +15. Mycophenolate
mofetil 600 mg/m2 bid was given on days −1 to +28 as

GvHD prophylaxis. To reduce the risk of EBV-associ￾ated lymphoproliferative disease, in vivo B cell depletion
was performed by a single infusion of 375 mg/m2 rituxi￾mab on day +1.
The father was chosen as an optimal donor. Donor
peripheral blood stem cells were mobilized with recom￾binant human granulocyte-colony stimulating factor and
harvested. The harvest was processed using immuno￾magnetic selection of CD34+ cells (CliniMACS system,
Miltenyi Biotec, Germany) [20]. The dose of CD34+ for
Pat1 was limited to 27×106 /kg to reduce the risk of
engraftment syndrome and the residual was stored in
nitrogen liquid and transplanted to Pat2 9 months
later. Details regarding the haplo-SCT are presented
in Table 1.
Patients
Patient 1 (male)
Pregnancy and delivery were normal for Pat1. Birth
weight was 3200 g (−0.31 SD), length 50 cm (+0.06 SD)
and head circumference 33 cm (−1.15 SD). He was acci￾dentally diagnosed with MPS VI at the age of 10 months,
when hypergranulated neutrophils were detected on rou￾tine blood smear. uGAG was at two separate occasions
52.5 and 102 g/mol creatinine (ref. 22–50) with in￾creased DS to 50% of total uGAG (ref. <10%). ARSB ac￾tivity was 0 μkat/kg protein in leukocytes (ref. 17–40)
and 11 μkat/kg protein in fibroblasts (ref. 40–90). Intel￾lectual and physical development at the time of diagno￾sis was normal. Pat1 was treated for obstructive
bronchitis in connection with upper airway infection at
10 months of age. The only pre-transplant findings
consisted of a borderline hepatomegaly. Genetic analysis
of the ARSB gene identified a homozygous p.C192R
mutation.
Patient 2 (female)
The younger sibling (Pat2) was born after a normal
pregnancy and delivery. Her birth weight was 2860 g
(−0.85 SD), length 47 cm (−1.15 SD) and head circum￾ference 33 cm (−0.74 SD). Screening with uGAG im￾mediately after birth revealed 227 g/mol creatinine
(ref. 35–73). DS was increased to 50% of total uGAG
(ref. <10%). ARSB activity in leukocytes was 3.6 μkat/kg
protein (ref. 17–40). Pat2 harbored the homozygous mu￾tation p.C192R, identical to that of Pat1. During the phys￾ical exam before the first transplantation, the only finding
was irregular skeletal maturation on X-ray of the hands.
Parents
The siblings were born to healthy parents of Arabic ori￾gin who were first cousins. Consanguinity was common
in the family. Anamnestic information revealed six re￾latives with symptoms compatible with MPS VI (not
confirmed by laboratory nor clinical examinations). The
mother’s height was 162 cm (−0.18 SD) and the father’s
179 cm (+0.34 SD). The leukocyte ARSB activity was
25.4 μkat/kg protein for the father and 32.7 μkat/kg pro￾tein (ref. 17–40) for the mother. Both parents were con￾firmed heterozygous carriers of the mutation p.C192R.
Informed consent for publication of the study was ob￾tained from both parents.
Results
Haplo-SCT Pat1
After UCBT the patient suffered from multiple viral
reactivations (EBV, Parvovirus B19, and HSV1) that in￾duced hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis resulting in
graft rejection 39 days post transplant. HSV1 pneumon￾itis and increasing respiratory obstruction necessitated
mechanical ventilation. For life-saving reason, urgent
haplo-SCT was performed with the father as donor,
54 days after the UCBT. The procedure was concluded
without complications and donor-derived hematological
recovery was achieved at day +10. The patient’s general
condition improved quickly allowing discharge from the
hospital at day +46 post haplo-SCT. Details of the trans￾plantations are presented in Table 1.
Haplo-SCT Pat2
Pat2 experienced primary non-engraftment with autolo￾gous recovery post-UCBT, confirmed by serial chime￾rism analysis. 59 days post-UCBT the patient received
haplo-SCT with the father as donor, as no HLA￾matched donor could be identified. Allogeneic recovery
was achieved at day +16. Pat2 experienced one general
seizure post haplo-SCT and subsequent MRI revealed a
low attenuating area size 3×3 cm in the right frontal
cerebrum. Lumbar puncture showed a minimal increase
of lymphocytes, a few monocytes and atypical lymphoid
cells. Cerebral biopsy was performed twice and showed
inflammatory encephalopathy but no etiologic agent was
identified. The recent MRI showed a decrease in the size
of the area. No sequela has been observed to date. De￾tails of the transplantations are shown in Table 1.
Initial analyses after haplo-SCT showed mixed chime￾rism in all cell lines in both patients, which subsequently
converted to complete donor chimerism, except for B
cells in Pat2 (Figure 1). Donor lymphocyte infusion was
not required. Analyses of peripheral blood confirmed
sustained immunological recovery for both patients.
Urinary GAG
Sixteen months post-haplo-SCT total uGAG in Pat1 was
39.7 g/mol creatinine (ref. 16–41) and DS was <10%
which is within normal limits (Figure 2). Since then total
uGAG has remained between 16–40 g/mol creatinine
and contained normal amounts of DS. Pat2’s total uGAG
Jester et al. Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases 2013, 8:134 Page 4 of 10
http://www.ojrd.com/content/8/1/134

had decreased to 38.3 g/mol creatinine (ref. 16–41)
12 months post-haplo-SCT and DS was <10%. Total
uGAG has since then remained between 19–50 g/mol
creatinine with normal DS.
ARSB activity
The ARSB activity in leukocytes in Pat1 increased after
the haplo-SCT and has been 10.8–37 μkat/kg protein
with a mean of 20.5 (ref. 17–40) (Figure 2). In Pat2 the
ARSB activity in leukocytes has been 13.7–24.5 μkat/kg
protein with a mean of 18.6 (Figure 2).
Current status of both patients
At follow-up assessment, Pat1 was aged 6.4 years and
Pat2 was 5.2 years. They showed normal social skills and
performed well in school and pre-school. Both patients
received corticosteroid inhalation during upper airway
infections to avoid wheezing. Both were on low dose
levothyroxine substitution for mild hypothyroidism, di￾agnosed at 15 (Pat1) and at 7 (Pat2) months post-haplo￾SCT. Neither hypothyroidism nor asthma or allergy was
common in the family’s medical history. Pat1used glasses
for astigmatism and hyperopia, and had esotropia of the
left eye.
The clinical status is shown in Table 2 for Pat1 at 4.6
(4 years and 7 months) years and for Pat2 at 3.8 (3 years
and 9 months) years post haplo-SCT. Both patients were
shorter than the average child (−1.85 and −1.27 SD, re￾spectively). The growth rate of Pat1 dropped 0.89 SD
after the transplantations (Figure 3) but then remained
steady at a height of approximately −2 SD. Pat2 has been
growing at approximately −1 SD in height since 2.5 years
of age (Figure 3).
Pat1 had remaining discrete hepatomegaly as seen be￾fore the treatment and X-ray on lumbar spine indicated
a biconvex L1-vertebrae. Pat2 had now normal hands
but slightly flattened lumbar vertebrae and bilateral
steep acetabular angles (Figure 4) without associated
symptoms. An elevated intraocular pressure and a bilat￾eral otosalpingitis with a conductive hearing loss were
found in Pat2 (Table 2).
During the walk of 6 minutes (420 m), both patients
had good endurance without any signs of fatigue, dys￾pnea, or difficulty with motor skills. Both were un￾affected by running. Joint examination of the shoulder,

Discussion
Until 1984, MPS VI patients were considered palliative
and only treated symptomatically [17]. Hematopoietic
SCT for enzyme correction in MPS was introduced in
1982 [21]. More than forty-five patients with MPS VI
have been reported transplanted so far [16]. Positive ef￾fects in MPS patients have been observed on enzyme ac￾tivity and reduced uGAG [2], endurance, joint motility,
puberty and growth, pulmonary/airway function, facial
features, hepatosplenomegaly, and survival [16,17]. He￾matopoietic SCT can, in contrast to ERT, improve oph￾thalmological and CNS abnormalities but the impact on
cardiac disease remains unclear [9,17,21,22]. It cannot
correct skeletal deformities that occurred prior to treat￾ment, but may prevent further progression [16,17]. In
the largest retrospective study of transplanted MPS VI
patients to date an overall survival rate of 66% at 3 years
post-transplant was found [16]. However the majority
(64%) of those patients were treated before 2000 and
the main cause of death was infection or organ failure.
Given the continuous progress in supportive care, better
donor selection, and new conditioning approach (e.g.
busulfan monitoring), a significantly reduced procedure￾related morbidity and mortality in connection with
hematopoeical SCT would be expected today [23].
Transplantation from a haploidentical family donor
has become an established procedure for treatment of
children with otherwise incurable malignant diseases
and serves as a treatment option for inborn or acquired
immunodeficiencies and other genetic disorders [24]. In￾vitro manipulation of the graft, mostly paternal/mater￾nal, and improved supportive care has lead to improved
outcome after haplo-SCT with decreased treatment￾related toxicity and infections, compared to conventional
SCT [25,26]. Haplo-SCT is in addition growing as an

alternative to HLA-matched hematopoietic SCT in ur￾gent cases.
ERT was developed in the 1990s and the treatment of
MPS VI was introduced in 2005 [17]. Recombinant
human ARSB are administered intravenously weekly or
every second week. Long-term improvements regarding
pulmonary function and growth rate have been observed
[27,28]. However, the enzyme cannot reach the CNS,
cornea, and articular cartilage [2]. The largest study of
ERT-treated MPS VI-patients showed improvements
concerning organomegaly, endurance and pulmonary
function but no improvements in vision, hearing, or car￾diac function [9]. It is important to consider the costs of
ERT (€150, 000–450,000 annually per patient [29]) as
well as the psychological burden of a life-long treatment.
The efficacy of ERT in MPS VI still needs to be long
term evaluated, as the treatment is only available since
2005.
The risks of SCT previously appeared to exceed the
benefits compared to ERT, and has for some years been
considered a second choice [10]. As a consequence,
only few publications regarding treatment outcome have

focused on hematopoietic SCT in MPS VI after intro￾duction of ERT. As highlighted above, SCT has some
clinical advantages compared to ERT and imposes a sin￾gle cost as well as a time-limited therapy for the patient.
For these reasons, it is of great importance to continue
evaluation of advantages and disadvantages of these two
treatment modalities.
The current patients are expected to develop disease
specific symptoms later in childhood or adolescence
considering the predicted mild to intermediate pheno￾type. One patient described in 2011 with homozygote
mutation p.C192R had at the age of 19 developed severe
skeletal and ophtalmological manifestations in addition
to pulmonary, nervous and cardiac symptoms [13]. Here,
the patients with the same genotype were doing well at
assessment 5– and 6 years of age, which might reflect
their phenotype of slowly progressing disease. Neverthe￾less, the biochemical analyses indicated sufficient ARSB
enzyme production from the heterozygote p.C192R
donor graft. They develop normally with good endur￾ance and motility. The endurance test in this study was
a simplified version of the standard 6MWT, nevertheless
the patients walked a distance of 420 meters unaffected,
which is considered normal/close to normal in 5 and
6 year-olds [30]. Pat1 had a relatively short stature. Al￾though it may represent a symptom of MPS VI, more
probably it is a consequence of treatment procedure,
considering the halted growth at time of transplantation.
X-ray on lumbar spine in Pat1 indicated a biconvex L1-
vertebrae with possible association to MPS VI. Relevant
is also Pat1’s impaired visual acuity (hyperopia and
esotropia) and the discrete hepatomegaly. Most notable
in Pat2 were the radiological, ophtalmological, and
audiological findings, although the latter probably con￾stitute a normal variant due to a recent otitis media.
Lumbar X-ray on Pat2 showed anterior-inferior beaking
typical for MPS VI [2,10]. The bilateral dysplastic hips
are typical of MPS VI, but may also be an undiagnosed
congenital defect or late skeletal development.
Both patients were at time of assessment treated for
mild hypothyroidism and transient but recurrent wheez￾ing. It is hard to truly evaluate whether these symptoms
are related progression of MPS VI or long-term compli￾cations of treatment. It is therefore essential to report
the current patients in a longer perspective.
In conclusion, two young children with MPS VI re￾ceived and tolerated haploidentical SCT after previous
transplant failure. Normalization of enzyme production
and dermatan sulfaturia indicate correction of the in￾born error of metabolism and coincide with no obvious
symptoms of MPS VI progression up to 4.6 years post￾SCT. The subtle clinical findings reported here need
longer follow-up to determine their etiology. Additional
data on clinical and biochemical outcome after SCT in
Figure 5 Two patients with MPS VI, 4.5 and 3.75 years after haploidentical stem cell transplantation. Panel A: lateral view, Panel B:
posterior view; patient 1 to the left and patient 2 to the right. Physical appearance and motoric skills were normal for their age. The images are of
low resolution for the patients’ confidentiality.

MPS VI-patients is needed to motivate its role as ad￾equate treatment and whether haploidentical SCT might
be a future recommendation.
