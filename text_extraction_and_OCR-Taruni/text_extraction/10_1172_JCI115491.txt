Abstract
A viable autosomal recessive mutation (named fch, or ferroche￾latase deficiency) causing jaundice and anemia in mice arose in
a mutagenesis experiment using ethylnitrosourea. Homozy￾gotes (fch/fch) display a hemolytic anemia, photosensitivity,
cholestasis, and severe hepatic dysfunction. Protoporphyrin is
found at high concentration in erythrocytes, serum, and liver.
Ferrochelatase activity in various tissues is 2.7-6.3% of nor￾mal. Heterozygotes (+/fch) are not anemic and have normal
liver function; they are not sensitive to light exposure; ferroche￾latase activity is 45-65% of normal. Southern blot analysis us￾ing a ferrochelatase cDNA probe reveals no gross deletion of
the ferrochelatase gene. This is the first spontaneous form of
erythropoietic protoporphyria in the house mouse. Despite the
presence in the mouse of clinical and biochemical features un￾frequent in the human, this mutation may represent a model for
the human disease, especially in its severe form. (J. Clin.

Introduction
Ferrochelatase is the last enzyme on the heme biosynthesis
pathway. It is present in mitochondria and catalyzes the inser￾tion ofthe reduced form ofiron (Fe2") into protoporphyrin (1).
In humans, erythropoietic protoporphyria is associated with a
reduced activity of ferrochelatase (2). The disease is character￾ized by cutaneous photosensitivity. A mild microcytic, hy￾pochromic anemia is observed in a minority of cases. Fatalities
from rapidly progressive liver disease have been reported in at
least 20 patients (1). Liver function tests are usually normal
until shortly before liver failure becomes evident. Biochemi￾cally, erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP)' results in accumu￾lation of protoporphyrin in erythrocytes, plasma, and feces.
Although EPP is generally assumed to be an autosomal domi￾nant hereditary condition, recent data suggest that the disease
may be inherited, in some cases, in an autosomal recessive
fashion (3, 4).

Ferrochelatase deficiency has been described in cattle (5).
Affected cows develop skin lesions after exposure to sunlight
but, unlike human, they do not develop anemia or hepatobili￾ary disease (6). Bovine protoporphyria is transmitted as an au￾tosomal recessive trait.
We describe here ferrochelatase deficiency in the house
mouse, observed after a chemical mutagenesis experiment with
ethylnitrosourea (ENU). Affected animals exhibit a mild ane￾mia with a high reticulocyte count, photosensitivity, and dra￾matic hepatobiliary dysfunction with jaundice from the early
days of life onwards. This condition is transmitted in an auto￾somal recessive fashion and represents the first genetically de￾termined mouse model for human erythropoietic protopor￾phyria. The mutation has been named "ferrochelatase defi￾ciency" (fch).
Methods
Animals. The first mutant arose during in-breeding after a mutagenesis
experiment in which males from an inbred strain carrying eight reces￾sive mutations were injected with 250 mg/kg ethylnitrosourea (Sigma
Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO). After successive matings with 129/Sv
and BALB/c inbred strains, inbreeding was carried out. After a few
generations of brother-sister mating, three mice in a litter of 10 dis￾played icteric sera. This characteristic appeared to be transmitted as a
simple mendelian recessive trait. Homozygous males (fch/fch) from
this pedigree were crossed with normal BALB/c females. The obligate
heterozygous male offspring (+/fch) were crossed in turn with normal
BALB/c females to produce heterozygous (+/fch) and normal (+/+)
males. Heterozygotes (+/fch) were identified by crossing with an ho￾mozygous female (fch/fch). The same process was repeated with the
goal of introducing the fch mutation into the BALB/c background.
Observations were made on these animals, during the process of back￾crossing, using BALB/c as controls (+/+).
Tests for allelism with spherocytosis (sph) and Hertwig's anemia
(an) were performed by Pr. H. Scheufler, Martin Luther Universitit,
Halle-Wittenberg, Germany.
Linkage experiments were performed using several mutations
which affect the coat color or the skeleton, and located on mouse chro￾mosomes 1-1 1, 13, 15, and 17. In particular, we used leaden (In) for
chromosome 1, brown (b) for chromosome 4, albino (c) for chromo￾some 7, Sombre (Es)) for chromosome 8, and waved-2 (wa-2) for chro￾mosome 1 1.
Southern blot analysis. High-molecular weight DNA was prepared
from six +/+, +/fch, and fch/fch adult mice, according to standard
protocols. 10 ,g of each DNA were digested with the following restric￾tion enzymes: Bam HI, Eco RI, Hind III, Sac I, Taq I, and Xba I, under
recommended conditions. Digested DNAs were electrophoresed in
0.8% agarose gels and transfered on Hybond N+ filters (Amersham), as
originally described by Southern (7).
Ferrochelatase cDNA was obtained from Taketani (8). The probe
was labeled according to the procedure of Feinberg and Vogelstein (9).
Hybridization was performed according to the method of Church and
Gilbert (10).

Hematological methods. Blood samples were collected from mu￾tant and normal appearing related mice at various ages (4 wk, 3 mo, 6
mo, or more) either by puncture of the orbital sinus or by heart punc￾ture.
Blood parameters were measured using standard methods (i.e.,
Coulter Electronics, Inc., Counter [Hialeah, FL] for cell counts and
hemoglobin, new methylene blue staining for reticulocytes).
Red cell osmotic resistance was tested on three mutants and three
normal mice, aged 3 mo or more, using a standard protocol (11). The
density distribution curve of erythrocytes was obtained according to
the method described by Danon and Marikovsky (12).
Dried blood films were examined with Wright-Giemsa stain and by
Perl's method for iron.
Biochemical methods. The usual biochemical parameters, conju￾gated and unconjugated bilirubin, transaminases, and alkaline phos￾phatases were determined by using a model SRA 2000 system (Techni￾con Instruments Corp., Tarrytown, NY) or a Paramax (Baxter Health￾care Corp., Deerfield, IL).
Hemoglobins were analyzed by cellulose acetate electrophoresis
(13). Globin chains synthesis was analyzed after incorporation of 3H￾leucine into blood reticulocytes by PAGE in urea and Triton X 100 (14)
followed by autoradiography.
Ferrochelatase activity was measured by a radiochemical method
using "Fe and mesoporphyrin as substrate, as described by Deybach et
al. (15).
Protoporphyrin was determined by the method of Schwartz et al.
(16) or separated and quantitated as methyl esters using HPLC with
spectrofluorometric detection (17).
Histology. Liver, bone marrow, and spleen were examined after
Bouin's fixation, Paraplast embedding, and hematein-eosin staining.
Results
Clinicalfeatures
All fch/fch mutant mice are recognizable by the intense yellow
color oftheir sera and, often, by gross bilirubinuria. Jaundice is
usually apparent, especially in unpigmented albino mice. It is
most severe in pups and young adult mice and often decreases
slightly after a few months of age.
Photosensitivity was observed in fch/fch homozygotes
under standard husbandry conditions (fluorescent light). In￾flammatory lesions appear on ears and back, which often be￾come ulcerous. No photosensitivity was observed in heterozy￾gotes.
Youngfch/fch homozygotes do not show any difference in
size or body weight, compared to normal sibs, nor are they
retarded in growth. However, they have enlarged livers and
spleens, from the early days of life onwards (Table I). After a
few months of age, they exhibit an enlarged abdomen (due to
hepatomegaly and splenomegaly), decreased fat tissue and hy￾poactivity. Fertility appears to be reduced in both sexes, proba￾bly as a result of the general bad condition of affected animals.
Heterozygotes sometimes have a slightly icteric sera at 3 wk
of age, but this disappears by adult age.
Genetical analysis
Segregation analysis. Animals were recorded as mutants when
they exhibited icteric sera at both 3 wk of age and at adult age
(6-12 wk of age). When mutant mice were intercrossed, all the
progeny (45 out of 45) were affected. Matings between affected
and normal BALB/c mice produced no mutant progeny (out of
> 50 animals). These progeny were considered as obligate het￾erozygotes. Intercrosses between these putative heterozygotes
yielded 33 affected animals out of 173 progeny (19%, not signifi￾cantly different from the expected value 25%). Crosses between
putative heterozygotes and affected homozygotes produced
53% affected offspring (50 out of 95). These data are compati￾ble with the inheritance pattern ofa single autosomal recessive
gene.
Test of allelism. This new mutation was compared to al￾ready described mutations causingjaundice or anemia in mice.
The mutation was found not to be an allele ofthe spherocytosis
(sph) and Hertwig's anemia (an) loci.
Linkage experiments. No genetic linkage was found be￾tween the fch mutation and any of the markers which have
been tested. Subsequently, the fch mutation was found to be
linked neither to the albino locus (c) which is in the vicinity of
the f3-globin gene on mouse chromosome 7, nor to the waved-2
locus (wa-2) which is close to the a-globin gene on mouse chro￾mosome 1 1.
Southern blot analysis. For each of the six enzymes tested,
all +/+, +/fch andfch/fch animals exhibited the same hybrid￾ization pattern with the ferrochelatase cDNA probe (not
shown).
Hematological studies
The results of hematological studies are shown in Fig. 1 and
Table II. Homozygous fch/fch animals were not anemic at 1
mo of age but normocytic anemia developed with age. Poly￾chromasia, anisocytosis, target cells, and leptocytes were ob￾served on blood films (Fig. 2). The red cell volume range distri￾bution width was found to be increased in 3-6 mo oldfch/fch
mice (34.9, as compared to 21.6 in +/+ controls). Reticulocyto￾sis was markedly increased (14% in homozygotes instead of 3%
in normal controls or heterozygotes). Perl's staining revealed
no siderocytes or excess sideroblasts in bone-marrow smears
which contained an increased proportion of erythroblasts.
The osmotic fragility oferythrocytes from homozygousfch/
fch mice was slightly decreased. 50% osmotic lysis offch/fch red
cells occurred at a saline concentration of0.46% compared to a
figure of 0.53% for control red cells. The slope was also less

Discussion
The new fch mutation, observed after chemical mutagenesis,
produces in fch/fch mice a dramatic increase in the level of
7 protoporphyrin in erythrocytes, plasma, liver, and stool, hemo￾lytic anemia and hepatic abnormalities which mimic the bio￾chemical features found in the severe forms of human EPP
rch/fch mice (five (18). These abnormalities are due to a pronounced specific de￾ficiency of ferrochelatase activity, with < 7% residual activity
found in all tissues tested (Table IV). Because of its very high
erythropoietic activity, the spleen was used instead of bone
sed heterogene- marrow to estimate the level of enzymatic activity. Heterozy￾gous (+/fch) mice display normal biochemical and hemato￾creased density logical values (Tables II and III) but have a 50% enzymatic
ad of 1.104 for deficiency (Table IV). These results are consistent with an au￾more heteroge- tosomal recessive mode of inheritance. Moreover, they
strongly suggest that the ferrochelatase structural gene itself
could be the site of the mutation. A gross deletion within this
gene can be excluded by the results from Southern blot analy-
-/fch, sis, but a point mutation, which has been reported to be the
group) most frequent outcome of mutagenesis with ENU, remains
possible.
fch/fch Photosensitivity was observed in homozygotes (fch/fch)
under standard husbandry condition (fluorescent light) but not
9.9±1.3 in heterozygotes. Skin lesions were more severe in albino than
6.5±0.8 in pigmented mice, on ears and back than on light protected
31.1±4.0 areas. This feature is similar to the condition observed in the
47.7±1.2 human or in cattle.
15.3±0.6 In spite ofthe morphological aspects, the increased osmotic
14 resistance and the low density oferythrocytes, thefch mutation
was shown not to be a form of thalassemia for at least two
nic, anemia, with reasons. First, before we backcrossed onto BALB/c the stock in
which the mutation arose, we found homozygotes (fch/fch)

among albino (c/c) as well as nonalbino (+/+ or +/c) animals,
indicating that albino (c), which is linked to the P-globin gene
on mouse chromosome 7, is not linked to thefch mutation. In
addition, the fch determinant was not linked to the , globin
haplotypes. Linkage results indicated thatfch is not linked to
wa-2, which is closely linked to a-globin gene, on mouse chro￾mosome 11. Second, in vitro synthesis experiments did not
show disequilibrium between a and P globin chain synthesis.
These results clearly show thatfch is not linked to globin genes.
Erythrocytes are heterogenous in hemoglobin content
(some are very hypochromic) and in size (as shown by the
increased range distribution width). They have a decreased
density, which is a very sensitive parameter for detecting cells
with a low hemoglobin concentration, and a higher resistance
to hypoosmolarity. These features may be related in part to the
reticulocytosis. They also suggest a slightly decreased hemoglo￾bin synthesis which can be attributed to the profound defi￾ciency in ferrochelatase ofthe highly erythropoietic spleen and
not to a thalassemic determinant. Portal hypertension, hyper￾splenism, and cholestatic jaundice may have enhanced the he￾matological abnormalities. There is no indication of an iron
metabolism defect in erythroblasts, as evidenced by Perl's
staining and electron microscopy of bone marrow and spleen.
We could not test allelism for all other recessive mutations
causing anemia in mice, mainly because we could not get mu￾tant mice from holders. However, we were able to discard most
of these loci, partly because of a very different phenotype (19,
20), partly according to results from linkage experiments.
Scheufler (21) has described an anemia in the mouse (hbd,
hemoglobin deficit) associated with a high level of free red cell
protoporphyrin. This anemia is mild, hypochromic and micro￾cytic. It is not associated with hyperbilirubinemia, or with liver
abnormalities (22).
The only spontaneous animal model of EPP has been de￾scribed in cows (5). It is associated with a photosensitizing dis￾ease, transmitted as a recessive trait (6). Ferrochelatase activity

Red cell morphology and blood cell indices were normal. The
bilirubin level was not reported. Cutaneous lesions were exten￾sive. Erythrocytes and fecal protoporphyria exceeded by far
those of human protoporphyria. As reported so far, the bovine
deficiency in ferrochelatase is not associated with the hemato￾logical and hepatic features observed in severe human EPP
cases and in fch/fch mice (23). This lack of hepatobiliary dis￾ease in cattle with protoporphyria could be explained, in part,
by the enhancement of bile acids secretion which helps main￾taining efficient protoporphyrin excretion (24).

A biochemical protoporphyria phenotype can be easily ex￾perimentally induced in mice using griseofulvine (GF) as an
inhibitor of ferrochelatase (25). It has been used as an experi￾mental model for human EPP but the site of excess protopor￾phyrin synthesis in GF-induced mice is thought to be the liver,
despite erythrocyte protoporphyrin concentration can become
comparable to that observed in human EPP (26).
Human EPP is an hereditary disorder of heme synthesis
characterized clinically by early skin photosensitivity, mainly
in the form of burning and oedema shortly after exposure to
sunlight. It is characterized biochemically by an increased level
of protoporphyrin IX in red cells, plasma and feces, as the
consequence of deficient ferrochelatase activity. The disease
usually takes a benign course. Photosensitivity is thought to be
produced by photochemical activation of the excess protopor￾phyrin. A minority ofpatients show a mild hypochromic micro￾cytic anemia.
The inheritance ofhuman EPP has been generally assumed
to be as an autosomal dominant trait, but with partial pene￾trance (1, 27). However, latent cases seem to be very common.
A study on 91 Dutch families (28) concluded that the disease
followed a recessive mode of transmission but this study was
based only on phenotypic features (fluorocytes in blood) and
not on ferrochelatase activity measurements. Nevertheless, the
profound enzymatic defect repeatedly found in patients (10-
30% of normal) compared to the defect in asymptomatic car￾riers (40-50% of normal) (3) and the recent reports of a reces￾sive mode of transmission of the ferrochelatase defect (3, 4)
associated with clinical features similar to those observed in
usual cases suggest that EPP is not transmitted as a simple
dominant trait but may require more than a single gene defect
for disease expression.
The hepatic defects represent a major and constant feature
in thefch/fch mouse. Hepatomegaly is observed from the early
days oflife onwards and increases with age. It is associated with
cholestasis, as shown by the high levels of conjugated bilirubin
and alkaline phosphatase activity, and dilation of intrahepatic
biliary ducts containing crystals. Unconjugated bilirubin is less
affected, indicating that the hepatic conjugation system is very
active but saturated, in relation to the increased hemolysis.
Cirrhosis and hepatocyte dysfunction are documented by ele￾vated transaminases and light and electron microscopy show￾ing degenerated hepatocyte and fibrosis. Crystals, most proba￾bly of protoporphyrin, which is produced in excess by the er￾Figure 4. Electron micrographs of a fch/fch mouse showing

ythron, are present in hepatocytes and Kupffer cells. These
crystals are likely to be responsible for cholestasis, which in
turn explains the increase of conjugated bilirubin, an unusual
feature in hemolytic anemia.
In the human EPP, a fairly large number of patients suffer
from cholelithiasis with gallstones made of protoporphyrin
complexes. The severity ofthe disease is related in a minority of
cases to fibrosis and even cirrhosis of the liver, but acute liver
failure is not frequent (1). Light and electron microscopic exam￾ination of liver biopsies from human EPP patients have re￾vealed a wide variability in findings, ranging from normality to
periportal fibrosis and severe cirrhosis. Accumulation ofproto￾porphyrin has been detected as brown pigments in hepatocytes,
Kupffer cells and biliary canaliculae. A recent study (29) con￾cluded that ultrastructural changes in the hepatic parenchymal
cells are present in early stages ofthe disease. Moreover, biliary
canalicular abnormalities responsible for cholestasis were ob￾served, similar to that described in rat livers perfused with pro￾toporphyrin (30).
Human EPP thus remains controversial with regard to its
pathophysiological aspects, mode of inheritance, skin photo￾toxicity, liver injury, and treatment. The source of excess pro￾toporphyrin seems to be the erythron as suggested by the recent
liver transplantation reports in EPP patients (31). However, the
mechanism of liver injury, appropriate markers to detect pa￾tients at risk of liver failure and then appropriate therapy are
some important aspects which an animal model, like the fch/
fch mouse, could help clarify.
Conclusion
The fch mutation is characterized by a ferrochelatase defi￾ciency. In the homozygous state, this mutation is responsible
for more severe anemia and hepatic dysfunction than the hu￾man disease. In contrast, heterozygotes remain asymptomatic
at 1 yr ofage, but their long-term clinical evolution will have to
be assessed. The mutation will be localized on the mouse chro￾mosomes. Molecular studies will be attempted to check
whether the ferrochelatase gene is affected, or not.
Despite differences in inheritance and penetrance of the
severe hepatic phenotype, this mutation represents a useful
model to study the pathophysiological features of the human
disease. Bone marrow transplantation experiments will pro￾vide indications on the major source of excess protoporphyrin

production. Putative risk factors could be identified to predict
severe liver injury. Treatments could also be attempted to pre￾vent or to stop the progression ofthe disease (chenodesoxycho￾lic acid, hematin transfusion).
