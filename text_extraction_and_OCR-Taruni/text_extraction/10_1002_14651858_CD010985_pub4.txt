Background
Sickle cell disease is the most common hemoglobinopathy occurring worldwide and sickle cell intrahepatic cholestasis is a complication
long recognized in this population. Cholestatic liver diseases are characterized by impaired formation or excretion (or both) of bile from
the liver. There is a need to assess the clinical benefits and harms of the interventions used to treat intrahepatic cholestasis in people with
sickle cell disease. This is an update of a previously published Cochrane Review.
Objectives
To assess the benefits and harms of the interventions for treating intrahepatic cholestasis in people with sickle cell disease.
Search methods
We searched the Cystic Fibrosis andGeneticDisordersGroup'sHaemoglobinopathies Trials Register, which comprises references identified
from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearching of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings.
We also searched the LILACS database (1982 to 21 January 2020), the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform Search Portal and
ClinicalTrials.gov (21 January 2020).
Date of last search ofthe Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register: 25 November 2019.
Selection criteria
We searched for published or unpublished randomised controlled trials.
Data collection and analysis
Each author intended to independently extract data, assess the risk of bias of the trials by standard Cochrane methodologies and assess
the quality of the evidence using the GRADE criteria; however, no trials were included in the review.
Main results
We did not identify any randomised controlled trials.

Review question
We aimed to review the evidence for treating intrahepatic cholestasis (liver diseases where bile is either not formed or excreted properly
(or both)) in people with sickle cell disease. This is an update of a previously published Cochrane Review.
Background
Sickle cell disease is an inherited condition and the most common hemoglobinopathy occurring worldwide. In 2006, the WHO declared
sickle cell disease as a major public health problem with an estimated 70% of suNerers living in Africa. It is common among people with
sub-Saharan African, Indian, Middle Eastern or Mediterranean ancestry.
Sickle cell disease aNects the hepatobiliary system (liver, gall bladder, bile ducts), with repeated reduced blood flow and the formation
of bilirubin stones (a type of gallstone). This results from sickled cells blocking blood vessels and from a reduction in the lifespan of
these cells. Sickle cell intrahepatic cholestasis or sickle cell hepatopathy (abnormal or diseased liver) is one complication of the disease.
When diagnosed, people with this condition may show an intense yellowing of skin and eyes due to an increasing level of serum bilirubin
(jaundice), tiredness, generalized itching, increasing pain in the upper right quadrant of the abdomen due to gallstones, an enlarged liver
and lower hemoglobin levels.
Sickle cell intrahepatic cholestasis, while uncommon, is a potentially fatal complication with a high death rate. There is no agreement in
how to diagnose or treat this condition. We wanted to assess the benefits and harms of treatments for intrahepatic cholestasis in people
with sickle cell disease.

Description of the condition
Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited condition and the most
common hemoglobinopathy occurring worldwide (Azar 2017;
Piel 2017; Ware 2017). The sickle hemoglobin is an abnormal
hemoglobin due to a point mutation of the beta (β) globin gene
resulting in the substitution of glutamic acid by valine at position 6
of the β globin polypeptide chain (Azar 2017; Piel 2017; Ware 2017).
According to the WHO, SCD is a major public health problem
(WHO 2006; Modell 2008) with an estimated 70% of suNerers living
in Africa (Tluway 2017). It is common among people with sub￾Saharan African, Indian, Middle Eastern or Mediterranean ancestry
(Creary 2007; Modell 2008). The term SCD includes sickle cell
anaemia (Hb SS), hemoglobin S combined with hemoglobin C
(Hb SC), hemoglobin S associated with β thalassemia (Sβ0 Thal
and Sβ⁺Thal) and other less prevalent double heterozygous
conditions which cause clinical disease (Steinberg 2009; Weatherall
2006). Hemoglobin S combined with normal hemoglobin (A) is
known as the sickle cell trait (AS), which is generally asymptomatic
andisnotpart ofthis review.Recently,the clinical andother aspects
of SCD have been reviewed (Azar 2017; Piel 2017; Ware 2017).
Sickle cell intrahepatic cholestasis is a hepatic complication long
recognized in people with SCD (Guimarães 2017; Pecker 2018;
Theocharidou 2019) and it is considered as an medical emergency
(Simon 2016). The cholestatic liver diseases are uncommon
conditions characterized by impaired formation or excretion
(or both) of bile from the liver. Sickle cell disease aNects the
hepatobiliary system (Ballas 2012; Ebert 2010), with recurrent
ischemia and bilirubin stones resulting from vascular obstruction
and red cell hemolysis of the sickle cell (Ballas 2012). Biochemical
abnormalities, including elevation of alkaline phosphatases, total
bilirubin, and γ-glutamyl transpeptidase, typically precede the
development of jaundice (Carey 2012). Fatigue and pruritus are
the most common symptoms associated with cholestasis (Carey
2012). Acute pain in the right upper quadrant is common in people
with SCD and described as right upper quadrant syndrome (Ballas
2012). This syndrome must be separated from the more common
symptoms of SCD, i.e., hepatic crisis, hepatic sequestration,
autoimmune hepatitis, viral hepatitis, hepatic siderosis, sickle cell
intrahepatic cholestasis or sickle cell hepatopathy, cholelithiasis,
biliary sludge, choledocholithiasis, acute cholecystitis, and chronic
cholecystitis (Ballas 2012). Hepatic sequestration is a component
of the right upper quadrant syndrome and it is best diagnosed
by a rapid enlargement of the liver with a concurrent drop in
hemoglobin concentration. Furthermore, the bilirubin will also be
elevated, with a high percentage of direct bilirubin (Ballas 2012).
According to a recent expert panel report, people with acute
sickle cell intrahepatic cholestasis show a sudden onset of
right upper quadrant pain, severe jaundice due to extreme
hyperbilirubinemia (both conjugated and unconjugated) usually
without urobilinogenuria, a progressively enlarging and exquisitely
tender liver and light-colored stools (NIH 2014; Yawn 2014).
Furthermore, thrombocytopenia, elevated alkaline phosphatase,
variable levels of transaminases, coagulopathy with increased
prothrombin time, and partial thromboplastin time to values more
than twice baseline values in the absence of accelerated hemolysis
or obstruction of the extrahepatic biliary system may also be
present.
The clinical picture suggests cholestatic jaundice or
choledocholithiasis but without evidence of common duct
obstruction or cholangitis. Sickle cell intrahepatic cholestasis
is an uncommon but potentially fatal complication with a
high death rate (Brunetta 2011; Khan 2011). The disease
is caused by diNuse sickling within the hepatic sinusoids
that ultimately leads to hypoxic hepatic damage and acute
hepatic failure (Khan 2011). Liver biopsies of these people
show erythrocytosis, erythrophagocytosis, sinusoidal dilatation
and hyperplasia in KupNer cells (Johnson 1985; Omata 1986;
Savafi 2006). Furthermore, sickle cell intrahepatic cholestasis
is associated with an increased risk of pericardial tamponade
(Khurshid 2002), and renal failure (Khan 2011). Older age and
underlying hepaticdisease havebeen suggestedaspoorprognostic
factors for sickle cell intrahepatic cholestasis in adults (Costa 2006).
Description of the intervention
Non-pharmaceutical interventions
• Simple red blood cell transfusion for increasing oxygen delivery.
• Exchange transfusion. Red cell exchange or erythrocytapheresis
is the most frequently recommended intervention for treating
intrahepatic cholestasis in people with SCD (Chitturi 2002;
Costa 2006; Danielson 2002; Horn 1987; Karunatilake 2009;
Likhtshteyn 2019; Maji 2020; Sheehy 1980; TiRik 2004). In 1980,
Sheehy and colleagues pioneered the use of this procedure in
SCD (Sheehy 1980). This Cochrane Review will use exchange
transfusion as the term for this procedure. In exchange
transfusion the patient’s red cells are removed and replaced
by exogenous normal red cells. The aim is to raise the level
of hemoglobin A to between 60% and 70% while lowering the
level of hemoglobin S to 30% and reverse bilirubin levels to
normal values (Delis 2006; Donghaile 2013). This procedure can
be carried out manually or mechanically (Kleinman 1984).
• Liver transplantation (Gardner 2014; Kwun 2019; Racho 2019).
Pharmaceutical interventions
Several pharmacological therapies have been used to treat
people aNected by intrahepatic cholestasis in other clinical
settings (Angulo 2000; Azzaroli 2011; Carey 2012; Geenes 2009;
Muriel 2008). This Cochrane Review will include interventions for
treating cholestasis-associated pruritus: bile acid-binding resins
(i.e., cholestyramine, colestipol); rifampin; opiate antagonists
(naltrexone and nalmefene); sertraline; dexamethasone; guar gum;
and activated charcoal.
How the intervention might work
Non-pharmaceutical interventions
• Simple red blood cell transfusion increasing the hemoglobin
and hematocrit levels.
• Exchange transfusion prevents the removed sickle cells from
participating in new vaso-occlusive events, reduces hemolytic
complications, and provides added oxygen carrying capacity
while decreasing the blood viscosity (Swerdlow 2006). Red cell
exchange also rapidlydecreases the rate of hemolysis,which can
decrease liver processing of bilirubin, damage to renal tubular
cells and the scavenging of nitric oxide by free hemoglobin

released from sickle cells (Akinsheye 2010; Donghaile 2013; Kato
2007; Morris 2008).
• Liver transplantation is a transient therapy approach; however,
it does not resolve the fundamental issue.
Pharmaceutical interventions
For treating cholestasis-associated pruritus, bile acid￾binding resins (i.e., cholestyramine, colestipol), rifampin,
opiate antagonists (naltrexone and nalmefene), sertraline,
dexamethasone, guar gum and activated charcoal have the ability
to bind biliary acids in the gut lumen and block their absorption
(Azzaroli 2011; Carey 2012). However, there is potential for these
agents to interfere with the absorption of other medications (Carey
2012). Opiate antagonists reduce the increased level of opioidergic
tone associated with cholestatic pruritus.
Why it is important to do this review
While exchange transfusion is used for treating intrahepatic
cholestasis in people with SCD, there appears to be no specific
evidence supporting this medical approach. Exchange transfusion
requires packed red blood cell units which have undergone pre￾storage leukoreduction in order to prevent febrile non-hemolytic
reactions and which are screened for sickle cell traits to avoid
transfusing red cells containing hemoglobin S (Sarode 2006).
Due to a discrepancy of red cell antigens between African￾Americans and Caucasians (majority blood donors), the incidence
of alloantibody formation is very high, which makes it diNicult
to find compatible red cell units, especially for urgent red cell
exchange (Sarode 2006). Therefore, this requires a concerted eNort
between the apheresis unit, the local blood bank, and the central
blood supplier (Sarode 2006). Therapeutic apheresis is a relatively
safe procedure; however, it is associated with adverse events.
These include hypocalcemia due to citrate; increased frequency
of bleeding complications and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia
associated with heparin anticoagulation; urticarial reactions to
the protein-containing replacement fluid; depletion coagulopathy
and immunoglobulin depletion; catheter-related trauma; clotting;
infection; and bleeding (Kaplan 2012; Lee 2012). Additionally,
the benefits and harms of the alternative non-pharmaceutical
intervention, liver transplantation, should be assessed in this
clinical setting (Baichi 2005; Emre 2000). This is the second update
of a previously published Cochrane Review (Martí-Carvajal 2015;
Martí-Carvajal 2017).
Furthermore, clinical eNectiveness and safety of the
pharmacological therapies used to treat intrahepatic cholestasis
in other clinical settings should be reviewed in people with SCD
aNected by this hepatic disorder.

Better health. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews
The Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register is compiled from
electronic searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled
Trials (CENTRAL) (updated each new issue of the Cochrane
Library) and weekly searches of MEDLINE. Unpublished work
is identified by searching the abstract books of five major
conferences: the European Haematology Association conference;
the American Society ofHematology conference;theBritish Society
for Haematology Annual Scientific Meeting; the Caribbean Public
Health Agency Annual Scientific Meeting (formerly the Caribbean
Health Research Council Meeting); and the National Sickle Cell
Disease Program Annual Meeting. For full details of all searching
activities for the register, please see the relevant section of the
Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's website.
Date of last search: 25 November 2019.
We also searched in the following databases:
• LILACS (//lilacs.bvsalud.org) (1982 to 21 January 2020);
• Epistemonikos (www.epistemonikos.org) (up to 21 January
2020).
In addition, we searched trial registries via the WHO
International Clinical Trials Registry Platform search portal (ICTRP)
(apps.who.int/trialsearch/Default.aspx) and ClinicalTrials.gov
(www.clinicaltrials.gov) (21 January 2020).
Searching other resources
We aimed to check the reference lists of all the trials identified by
the above methods. However, we did not identify any RCTs.
Data collection and analysis
We were unable to identify any RCTs eligible for inclusion in this
review. Therefore, we could not perform the data analyses that we
had planned. If, in the future, trials are identified and included in
the review, we will adhere to the protocol described below.
Selection of studies
Arturo Martí-Carvajal (AMC) and Cristina Martí-Amarista (CMA)
will screen the search results for potentially relevant trials and
independently assess them for inclusion or exclusion, using a pre￾designed eligibility form based on the inclusion criteria. We will
resolve any disagreements through discussion until we reach a
consensus.
Data extraction and management
For future updates, one author (AMC) will extract data from the
included trials using a spreadsheet data extraction form and one
author (CMA) will check the data entered.
We will extract the following data:
• eligibility criteria of the trials;
• demographics (age, sex, country);
• hemoglobin genotype: sickle cell anemia (Hb SS); hemoglobin S
combined with hemoglobin C (Hb SC); hemoglobin S associated
with β thalassemia (Sβ0 Thal and Sβ+ Thal);
• hepatic biochemistry at time of entry and at end of trial (total,
unconjugated and conjugated bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase,
alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, gamma￾glutamyltransferase, albumin, prothrombin time);
• outcome data (all-cause mortality, lack of improvement,
adverse events, quality of life, numbers of jaundice, itching, and
being tired, liver biopsy);
• intervention data: type and regimens.
We will discuss any discrepancies between the review authors to
achieve a final consensus.
We aim to pool outcome data from trials based on the following
follow-up periods (zero to one week, over one week to four weeks,
overfour weeks to 24 weeks and over 24 weeks). If outcome data do
not permit such grouping, we shall pool the end-point data. These
diNerent time points are arbitrary and based on clinical judgment.
Assessment of risk of bias in included studies
For future updates, two review authors will independently assess
the risk of bias of each included trial using the domain-based
evaluation as described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic
Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2011). We will discuss any
discrepancies in an aim to achieve consensus.
We will assess the following domains, as per the definitions of each
classification below (Higgins 2011).
Generation of allocation sequence (checking for possible
selection bias)
We will describe the method used to generate the allocation
sequence in each included trial in suNicient detail to allow an
assessment of whether it should produce comparable groups.
We will assess the method as:
• low risk (any truly random process, e.g. random number table,
computer random number generator);
• high risk (any non-random process, e.g. odd or even date of
birth; hospital or clinic record number);
• unclear(ifthe trial was described as randomised butthe method
used forthe allocation sequence generation was not described).
  
Allocation concealment (checking for possible selection bias)
We will describe the method used to conceal the allocation
sequence in each included trial in suNicient detail to determine
whether intervention allocation could have been foreseen, in
advance of or during recruitment, or changed aRer assignment.
We will assess the methods as:
• low risk (e.g. telephone or central randomisation, consecutively
numbered sealed opaque envelopes);
• high risk (open random allocation, unsealed or non-opaque
envelopes, alternation, date of birth);
• unclear(ifthe trial was described as randomised butthe method
used to conceal the allocation was not described).
Blinding or masking (checking for possible performance bias)
For each included study we will describe the methods used, if any,
to blind trial participants and personnel from knowledge of which
intervention a participantreceived.We will judge trials atlow risk of
bias iftheywere blinded, orifwe judged thatthe lack of blinding did

not aNectthe results.Wewill assess blinding separately for diNerent
outcomes or classes of outcomes.
We will assess the methods as:
• low risk, high risk, or unclear for participants;
• low risk, high risk, or unclear for personnel;
• low risk, high risk, or unclear for outcome assessors.
Incomplete outcome data (checking for possible attrition bias
through withdrawals, dropouts, protocol deviations)
• Low risk (any one of the following): no missing outcome
data; reasons for missing outcome data unlikely to be related
to true outcome (for survival data, censoring unlikely to be
introducing bias); missing outcome data balanced in numbers
across intervention groups,with similarreasons for missingdata
across groups; for dichotomous outcome data, the proportion
of missing outcomes compared with observed event risk not
enough to have a clinically relevant impact on the intervention
eNect estimate; for continuous outcome data, plausible eNect
size (diNerence in means or standardised diNerence in means)
among missing outcomes not enough to have a clinically
relevant impact on observed eNect size; missing data have been
imputed using appropriate methods.
• High risk (any one of the following): reason for missing outcome
data likely to be related to true outcome, with either imbalance
in numbers or reasons for missing data across intervention
groups; for dichotomous outcome data, the proportion of
missing outcomes compared with observed event risk enough
to induce clinically relevant bias in intervention eNect estimate;
for continuous outcome data, plausible eNect size (diNerence
in means or standardised diNerence in means) among
missing outcomes enough to induce clinically relevant bias in
observed eNect size; ‘as-treated’ analysis done with substantial
departure of the intervention received from that assigned at
randomisation; potentially inappropriate application of simple
imputation.
• Unclear risk (any one of the following): insuNicient reporting of
attrition or exclusions to permit judgement of 'low risk' or 'high
risk' (e.g. numberrandomised not stated, no reasons for missing
data provided); the study did not address this outcome.
Selective reporting bias (reporting bias due to selective outcome
reporting)
We will describe for each included trial how we investigated the
possibility of selective outcome reporting bias and what we found.
We will assess the methods as follows.
• Low risk (any one of the following): the trial protocol is available
and all of the trial’s pre-specified (primary and secondary)
outcomes that are of interest in the review have been reported
in the pre-specified way, or the trial protocol is not available
but it is clear that the published reports include all expected
outcomes, including those that were pre-specified (convincing
text of this nature may be uncommon).
• High risk (any one of the following): not all of the trial's pre￾specified primary outcomes have been reported; one or more
primary outcomes is reported using measurements, analysis
methods or subsets of the data (e.g. subscales) that were not
pre-specified; one or more reported primary outcomes were
not pre-specified (unless clear justification for their reporting is
provided, such as an unexpected adverse eNect); one or more
outcomes of interest in the review are reported incompletely so
that they cannot be entered in a meta-analysis; the trial report
fails to include results for a key outcome that would be expected
to have been reported for such a trial.
• Unclear: insuNicient information to permit judgement of ‘low
risk’ or ‘high risk’.
Other bias (bias due to problems not covered elsewhere in the
table)
We will describe for each included trial any important concerns
we have about other possible sources of bias (baseline imbalance,
sponsorship bias, confirmation bias, bias of the presentation data,
etc.).
• low risk of bias, the trial appears to be free of other components
that could put it at risk of bias;
• unclear, the trial may or may not be free of other components
that could put it at risk of bias;
• high risk of bias,there are otherfactors in the trialthat could put
it at risk of bias, e.g. no sample size calculation made.
Overall risk of bias
We will make explicit judgements about whether trials were at
high risk of bias, according to the criteria given in the Cochrane
Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2011).
We will assess the likely magnitude and direction of bias, and
whether we will consider it likely to impact our findings.
We will regard trials assessed as having a 'low risk of bias' in all of
the individually-specified domains above as 'trials with an overall
low risk of bias'. We will consider trials assessed as having an
'uncertain risk of bias' or a 'high risk of bias' in one or more of the
above-specified individual domains as trials with 'an overall high
risk of bias'.
Measures of treatment e>ect
For future updates, if we are able to include trials, we will perform
meta-analyses according to Cochrane recommendations (Higgins
2011). We will use Review Manager 5 to analyse the data (RevMan
2014).
For binary outcomes, such as all-cause mortality, lack of
improvement, and adverse events, we will calculate the risk ratio
(RR) with the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI).
For continuous outcomes, such as quality of life, and relief of
fatigue,the authors will calculate the mean diNerence (MD) with the
corresponding 95% CI. However, if these outcomes are measured
using diNerent scales the authors plan to use the standardized
mean diNerence (SMD) with the corresponding 95% CI.
Unit of analysis issues
For future updates, if we are able to include trials, we will use the
randomised SCD participant as the unit of analysis.
We do notregard cross-overtrials or clusterrandomised trials to be
suitable designs for this intervention.

Dealing with missing data
For future updates, if we are able to include trials, we will contact
the lead author of each trial in an attempt to obtain the relevant
information or missing data (or both). If no further information is
available, we will carry out an available case analysis as our main
analysis, that is, the denominator for each outcome in each trial
will be the number randomised minus the number of participants
whose outcomes were known to be missing.
We will assess the percentage of dropouts for each included trial,
and for each trial group, and evaluate whether an intention-to-treat
(ITT) analysis has been performed or could have been performed
from the available published information.
Intention-to-treat analyses
Regarding the primary outcomes, we will include participants with
incompleteormissingdata insensitivity analysesby imputing them
according to the following scenarios (Hollis 1999).
• Poor-outcome analysis: assuming that dropouts or participants
lost from both the experimental and the control arms
experienced the outcome, including allrandomised participants
in the denominator.
• Good-outcome analysis: assuming that none of the dropouts or
participants lost from the experimental and the control arms
experienced the outcome, including allrandomised participants
in the denominator.
• Extreme-case analysis favouring the experimental intervention
('best-worse' case scenario): none of the dropouts or
participants lost from the experimental arm, but all of the
dropouts or participants lost from the control arm experienced
the outcome, including all randomised participants in the
denominator.
• Extreme-case analysis favouring the control ('worst-best'
case scenario): all dropouts or participants lost from the
experimental arm, but none from the control arm experienced
the outcome, including all randomised participants in the
denominator.
Assessment of heterogeneity
For future updates, if we are able to include trials, we will visually
assess the forest plot for heterogeneity and use the I2 statistic
and the Q test (P < 0.1) to measure statistical heterogeneity
between the trials. The I2 statistic describes the percentage of total
variation between trials due to heterogeneity rather than sampling
error (Higgins 2003). We will consider there to be significant
heterogeneity if I2 is more than 50% (Higgins 2011).
Assessment of reporting biases
Forfuture updates, if we are able to include trials, if 10 or more trials
are available, we will assess publication bias and other biases by
the use of a funnel plot (Sterne 2011).
Data synthesis
For future updates, if we are able to include trials, we plan to
conduct separate meta-analyses for the intervention groups (non￾pharmaceutical interventions and pharmaceutical interventions).
If the eligible trials are suNiciently comparable in their clinical
characteristics, we will use a random-eNects model and a fixed￾eNect model meta-analysis. If there is discrepancy between the
two models (e.g. one giving a significant intervention eNect, the
other no significant intervention eNect) we will report both results;
otherwise, we will report only the data using the random-eNects
model.
Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity
If we identify significant heterogeneity in a future update and we
are able to include at least 10 trials in the meta-analysis, we will
investigate the possible causes. We will devote further research to
identify the possible causes for this heterogeneity, exploring the
condition of the individuals.
We anticipate possible clinical heterogeneity in the eNect of the
intervention and if we find this we plan to conduct the following
subgroup analyses if possible:
• HbSS type versus HbSC type;
• geographical location of RCT;
• participants' age: less than 18 years old compared to 18 years
old and older;
• type of pharmaceutical intervention.
We will only conduct these subgroup analyses for primary
outcomes.
Sensitivity analysis
For any future update, if we include 10 or more trials, we plan to
conduct sensitivity analyses including only trials with an 'overall
low risk of bias' (Higgins 2011). It is unlikely we will find many
trials with an overall low risk of bias, therefore, we plan to choose
three core domains: generation of allocation sequence; incomplete
outcome data; and selective reporting bias.
Trial sequential analysis
Meta-analysis of cumulative data may run the risk ofrandom errors
('play of chance') due to sparse data and repetitive analyses of the
same data (Brok 2008; Brok 2009; Thorlund 2010; Thorlund 2011;
Wetterslev 2008; Wetterslev 2009; Wetterslev 2017). In order to
assess the risks of random errors in our cumulative meta-analyses,
we will conduct diversity-adjusted trial sequential analyses based
upon the proportion with the outcome in the control group; an a
priori set relative risk reduction of 20%; an alpha of 5%, an beta
of 20%; and the squared diversity in the meta-analysis (Thorlund
2009; Thorlund 2011; CTU 2011). For any future update, we will
conduct sensitivity analysis of the trial sequential analysis to
estimate the need for further trials.
Summary of findings tables
If, in the future, trials are identified and included in the review, we
plan to use the principles of the GRADE system to assess the quality
of the body of evidence associated with specific outcomes where
possible (all-cause mortality, lack of improvement, quality of life,
and adverse events) (Guyatt 2011a). We will construct a 'Summary
of Findings (SoF) table' using the GRADE soRware (GRADEPro
2008). The GRADE approach appraises the quality of a body of
evidence based on the extentto which one can be confidentthat an
estimate of eNect or association reflects the item being assessed.
The quality of a body of evidence is considered to be: within-study
risk of bias (methodologic quality); the directness of the evidence;
heterogeneity of the data; precision of eNect estimates; and risk of

Summary of main results
For this update, we have been unable to identify any RCTs
addressing the benefits and harms of either non-pharmaceutical
(simple red blood cell transfusion, exchange transfusion and
liver transplantation) or pharmaceutical interventions (for
treating cholestasis-associated pruritus: bile acid-binding resins
(i.e. cholestyramine, colestipol); rifampin; opiate antagonists
(naltrexone and nalmefene); sertraline; dexamethasone; guar gum;
and activated charcoal for treating intrahepatic cholestasis in
people with SCD.
Overall completeness and applicability of evidence
SCD is a major public health problem (WHO 2006; Modell 2008)
with an estimated 70% of those aNected living in Africa (Tluway
2017), the lack of RCTs to assess the clinical benefits and harms
of the interventions for treating intrahepatic cholestasis in people
with SCD is perplexing. In 2005, Lottenberg stated "The application
of evidence-based medicine to the management of adults with
sickle cell disease is currently primarily driven by clinical expertise
and patient preference, as there is a paucity of randomized
controlled trial data to guide decision-making" (Lottenberg 2005).
This updated Cochrane Review provides strong evidence in support
of Lottenberg's words.
SCD is a vasculopathy (Kassim 2013; Kato 2009). There are
several studies reporting the findings of the molecular biology
for explaining the endothelial damage in SCD (Caboot 2014;
Goodman 2013; Gutsaeva 2014; Kato 2006; Kato 2008; Kato 2009;
Kato 2014; Lockwood 2014; Morris 2014; Nishank 2013; Patel
2014; Sun 2013; Thakur 2014; Zhang 2012). They could explain
the severe complications of these people and could be used
as mechanistic reasoning for supporting RCTs in this condition.
Certainly, the scientific uncertainty is undeniable. It is widely
known that clinicians make practical decisions, oRen on the basis
of inadequate information.Decisions on treatment should be taken
based on the results of RCTs (Alderson 2004; Chalmers 2004).
The rationale for using either non-pharmaceutical or
pharmaceutical treatments for intrahepatic cholestasis in SCD
remains unknown. RCTs to answer the research question of this
Cochrane Review have not yet been carried out. It is possible that
some trials have been conducted, but due to their negative results,
they remain unpublished (Easterbrook 1991; Gluud 1998). We can
not support or rule out that trials on this subject are unpublished,
which is not surprising as was recently highlighted (Glasziou 2017).
This causes publication bias, reducing the possibility of developing
valid systematic reviews (Diringer 2003). This is influenced by
a number of factors, from the prevalence of the conditions to
the resources available to undertake research. Keeping clinical
uncertainty hidden does not benefit patients and may increase
health-service costs (Alderson 2000). Conversely, admitting clinical
uncertainty helps clarify treatment options and encourages further
research (Alderson 2000; Diringer 2003).
We have concluded that intrahepatic cholestasis is a neglected
complication of SCD. The paucity of data on clinical benefits and
harms of treatments for intrahepatic cholestasis in SCD should
stimulate the development of well-planned RCTs. Recently, a
number of recommendations have been suggested in order to
increase the value of and to reduce waste in biomedical research
(Chalmers 2014; Macleod 2014).
Quality of the evidence
We did not identify any eligible RCTs.
Potential biases in the review process
While performing this systematic review, we also planned to look
for 'significance-chasing biases' (Ioannidis 2010) which include,
among others, publication bias, selective outcome reporting bias,
selective analysis reporting bias, and fabrication bias (Ioannidis
2010). Publication bias represents a major threat to the validity of
systematic reviews, particularly in reviews that include small trials.
However, this Cochrane Review contains no trials and as such,
no risk of bias could be evaluated. Trials with 'negative' results
may have remained unpublished as suppression of information on
specific outcomes may have occurred (Ioannidis 2010). We have
been unable to identify evidence from RCTs supporting the use of
any intervention either non-pharmaceutical or pharmaceutical for
intrahepatic cholestasis in SCD.
The main limitation of this Cochrane Review is the paucity
of evidence in people with SCD suNering from intrahepatic
cholestasis.

(naltrexone and nalmefene); sertraline; dexamethasone; guar gum;
and activated charcoal) for treating intrahepatic cholestasis in
sickle cell disease (SCD). Therefore, it is not possible to determine
whether any of those interventions are beneficial or harmful for
people with SCD and intrahepatic cholestasis. Accordingly, we are
unable to evaluate the eNects of any intervention for treating
intrahepatic cholestasis in SCD.
Implications for research
Through this updated Cochrane Review, we have identified the
need for well-designed, adequately powered RCTs to assess the
benefits and harms of non-pharmaceutical and pharmaceutical
treatments as a way of treating the intrahepatic cholestasis
aNecting people with SCD. Potential trials should assess clinical
outcomes such as all-cause mortality, health-related quality of
life, fatigue and adverse events. However, this is a relatively rare
complication of SCD, making it unlikely thatthere would be enough
participants to conduct such a trial in a reasonable time-frame.
RCTs shouldbe reportedaccording to the consolidatedstandards of
reporting trials (CONSORT) statement for improving the quality of
reporting of eNicacy and harms in clinical research (Ioannidis 2004;
Moher 2010; Turner 2012). Future trials should be planned following
the Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional
Trials (SPIRIT) (Chan 2013; Chan 2013a) and the Foundation of
Patient-Centered Outcomes Research recommendations (Basch
2012; Gabriel 2012; PCORI 2012).

Acute hepatic injury Acute hepatic injury can be recognized by the presence of jaundice or non￾specific symptoms of acute illness accompanied
by elevation of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotrans￾ferase (ALT) (or both) activities.
NACB 2000
(www.aasld.org/
practiceguide￾lines/Documents/Prac￾tice%20Guidelines/He￾patic.pdf).
Albumin Albumin is the most abundant plasma protein produced by hepatocytes.
Rate of production is dependent on several factors, including supply of
amino acids, plasma oncotic pressure, levels of inhibitory cytokines (particu￾larly IL-6), and number of functioning hepatocytes.

Alanine aminotrans￾ferase
(ALT)
Aspartate aminotransferase (AST, also sometimes termed serum glutamic
oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT)) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT, also
sometimes
termed serum glutamic pyruvate transaminase (SGPT)) are widely distrib￾uted in cells throughout the body. AST is found primarily in heart, liver, skele￾tal muscle,

and kidney, while ALT is found primarily in liver and kidney, with lesser
amounts in heart and skeletal muscle
Alkaline phosphatase Alkaline phosphatase (ALP), involved in metabolite transport across cell
membranes, is found, in decreasing order of abundance, in placenta, ileal
mucosa, kidney, bone, and liver. Bone, liver, and kidney alkaline phos￾phatase share a common protein structure, coded for by the same gene.

Aspartate aminotrans￾ferase (AST)
Aspartate aminotransferase (AST, also sometimes termed SGOT) and alanine
aminotransferase (ALT, also sometimes termed SGPT) are widely distributed
in cells throughout the body. AST is found primarily in heart, liver, skeletal
muscle, and kidney, while ALT is found primarily in liver and kidney, with less￾er amounts in heart and skeletal muscle.

practiceguide￾lines/Documents/Prac￾tice%20Guidelines/He￾patic.pdf)
Bilirubin Daily production of unconjugated bilirubin is 250 mg to 350 mg, mainly from
senescent erythrocytes (65). Clearance at normal values is 5 mg/kg/day, or
about 400 mg/day in adults; the rate does not increase significantly with he￾molysis (66). The half-life of unconjugated bilirubin is < 5 minutes (67). UDP￾glucuronyltransferase catalyzes rapid conjugation of bilirubin in the liver;
conjugated bilirubin is excreted into bile and is essentially absent from blood
in normal individuals. Delta bilirubin (-bilirubin, also sometimes termed
biliprotein) is produced by reaction of conjugated bilirubin with albumin (68);
it has a half-life of about 17 to 20 days (the same as albumin), accounting for
prolonged jaundice in patients recovering from hepatitis or obstruction.
NACB 2000
(www.aasld.org/
practiceguide￾lines/Documents/Prac￾tice%20Guidelines/He￾patic.pdf)
Chronic hepatic injury Chronic hepatic injury is a relatively common disorder with minimal symp￾toms, yet with long term risk of significant morbidity and mortality. It is de￾fined pathologically by ongoing hepatic necrosis and inflammation in the liv￾er, often accompanied by fibrosis.

Exchange transfusion,
whole blood
Repetitive withdrawal of small amounts of blood and replacement with
donor blood until a large proportion of the blood volume has been ex￾changed.

Gamma-glutamyl
transferase
Gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT), a membrane bound, enzyme, is present
in decreasing order of abundance in proximal renal tubule, liver, pancreas
(ductules and acinar cells), and intestine. GGT activity in serum comes pri￾marily from liver. The half-life of GGT in humans is about seven to 10 days; in
alcohol-associated liver injury, the half-life increases to as much as 28 days,
suggesting impaired clearance.

Hemoglobin, sickle It is an abnormal hemoglobin due to point mutation (GAG → GTG) in exon 1
of the β globin gene resulting in the substitution of glutamic acid by valine at
position 6 of the β globin polypeptide chain.
Ballas 2012
Hyperbilirubinemia A condition characterized by an abnormal increase of bilirubin in the blood,
which may result in jaundice. Bilirubin, a breakdown product of heme, is nor￾mally excreted in the bile or further catabolized before excretion in the urine.

Jaundice A clinical manifestation of hyperbilirubinemia, characterized by the yellowish
staining of the skin; mucous membrane; and sclera. Clinical jaundice usually
is a sign of liver dysfunction.

Prothrombin time Prothrombin time (PT) measures the time required for plasma to clot after
addition of tissue factor and phospholipid; it is affected by changes in the ac￾tivity of factors X, VII, V, II (prothrombin) and I (fibrinogen). All of these factors
are synthesized in the liver, and three (II, VII, and X) are activated by a vitamin
K-dependent enzyme through addition of a second, -carboxyl group on glu￾tamic acid residues.

Based on two suggestions made by a peer reviewer and approved by editorial base, we did two changes:
1. To remove hydroxyurea as potential pharmacological intervention for treating intrahepatic cholestasis in SCD.
2. We included platelet count as secondary outcome. Therefore, we amended the 'Measures of treatment eNect' section: "For continuous
outcomes, such as quality oflife, and relief offatigue,the authorswill calculate standardized mean diNerence (SMD)with the corresponding
95% CI, if those outcomes are measured with diNerent scales. On the contrary, either platelet count or quality of life, and relief of fatigue
we plan to calculate mean diNerence (MD) with the corresponding 95% CI".
