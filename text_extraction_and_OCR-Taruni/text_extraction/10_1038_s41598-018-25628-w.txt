To evaluate the association between sarcopenia and tumor recurrence after living donor liver 
transplantation (LDLT) in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), we analyzed 92 
males who underwent LDLT for treating HCC beyond the Milan criteria. Sarcopenia was defined when 
the height-normalized psoas muscle thickness was <15.5mm/m at the L3 vertebra level on computed 
tomography based on an optimum stratification method using the Gray’s test statistic. Survival analysis 
was performed with death as a competing risk event. The primary outcome was post-transplant HCC 
recurrence. The median follow-up time was 36 months. There was a 9% increase in recurrence risk 
per unit decrease in height-normalized psoas muscle thickness. Twenty-six (36.1%) of 72 sarcopenic 
recipients developed HCC recurrence, whereas only one (5.0%) of 20 non-sarcopenic recipients 
developed HCC recurrence. Recurrence risk was greater in sarcopenic patients in univariable analysis 
(hazard ratio [HR]=8.06 [1.06–16.70], p=0.044) and in multivariable analysis (HR=9.49 [1.18–76.32], 
p=0.034). Greater alpha-fetoprotein and microvascular invasion were also identified as independent 
risk factors. Incorporation of sarcopenia improved the model fitness and prediction power of the 
estimation model. In conclusion, sarcopenia appears to be one of the important host factors modulating 
tumor recurrence risk after LDLT for advanced HCC.
Liver transplantation is an established therapeutic option to treat hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) because it 
removes both the tumor and surrounding premalignant parenchymal tissues. However, severe graft shortage lim￾its the candidacy for transplantation to patients with early stage HCC in whom the recurrence risk is relatively low 
and thus a lower probability of graft failure is predicted1
. As one way to overcome the graft shortage, liver trans￾plantation of grafts from living donors, so-called living donor liver transplantation (LDLT), allows more advanced 
HCC to be treated because living donors decide to donate at their own will and generally request permission to 
donate their grafts to a specific recipient without graft competition2
. In this regard, better understanding of factors 
contributing to tumor recurrence of this highly invasive cancer is required to compensate for the high recurrence 
risk and improve post-transplant outcomes after LDLT.
In addition to tumor biology, patient functional status also affects tumor recurrence after treatment. 
Sarcopenia, or skeletal muscle deterioration, is frequently encountered in patients with end-stage liver disease, 
with a reported incidence ranging up to 70%, and is considered an important parameter indicating impaired 
functional status2–5
. Previous studies have demonstrated that sarcopenia is associated with higher risk of HCC 
recurrence after liver resection6–8
. Thus, we deduced that the risk of post-transplant recurrence of advanced HCC

is affected by sarcopenia. In this study, we evaluated the relationship between sarcopenia and tumor recurrence 
after LDLT in patients with advanced HCC exceeding the Milan criteria (HCC beyond the Milan criteria).
Results
Characteristics of the subjects. The primary etiologies of HCC in the subjects were hepatitis B virus 
(n=78), hepatitis C virus (n=8), alcohol (n=3), and unknown (n=3). In the 92 patients, 91 presented with 
chronic liver cirrhosis, and 1 presented with acute-on-chronic liver failure. There were no recipients with acute 
liver failure or emergent surgery. Clinical characteristics of the two groups are described in Table 1. Body mass 
index was significantly lower in sarcopenic recipients than in non-sarcopenic recipients (23.8 vs. 25.5 kg/m2
, 
p=0.003). Accordingly, the proportion of recipients with <1.0% graft-to-recipient weight ratio was significantly 
lower in sarcopenic recipients (43.1% vs. 70.0%, p=0.033). Age was significantly greater in sarcopenic recipi￾ents (54 vs. 51 years, p=0.047). In terms of tumor characteristics, there were no significant differences between 
the two groups in alpha-fetoprotein level, tumor number/size, microvascular invasion, bile duct invasion, and 
non-tumor liver cirrhosis. Although statistical significance was not achieved, there was a trend toward a lower 
proportion of Edmonson grade III-IV (5.6% vs. 20.0%, p=0.065) in sarcopenic recipients.

Survival analysis. There were no recipients who were lost to follow-up without HCC recurrence. The median 
follow-up time was 36 (17–80) months. The median psoas muscle (PM) thickness was 13.1 (10.9–15.3)mm/m, 
and 72 (78%) patients showed sarcopenia. The continuous value of PM thickness was negatively associated with 
HCC recurrence risk with a marginal significance (coefficient=−0.089 [9% increase in recurrence risk per unit 
decrease in PM thickness], hazard ratio (HR)=0.92 [0.83–1.01], p=0.071). Twenty-seven (29.3%) recipients 
developed HCC recurrence: 26 of 72 (36.1%) sarcopenic recipients and one of 20 (5.0%) non-sarcopenic recipi￾ents (Fig. 1). The results of univariable analysis indicated that sarcopenia was significantly associated with HCC 
recurrence risk (HR=8.06 [1.06–16.70], p=0.044). The non-significance of continuous PM thickness and sig￾nificance of sarcopenia indicate that the clinical implications of PM thickness are not continuous, as shown in 
Supplementary Fig. S1. Graft-to-recipient weight ratio, recipient gender, body mass index, alpha-fetoprotein 
level, tumor size, and microvascular invasion, in addition to sarcopenia, were significantly associated with HCC 
recurrence (p<0.05, Table 2). As shown in Table 3, multivariable analysis confirmed the significantly higher 
recurrence risk in patients with sarcopenia (HR=9.49 [1.18–76.32], p=0.034). Higher alpha-fetoprotein level 
(HR=1.20 [1.03–1.39], p=0.022) and microvascular invasion (HR=5.30 [1.83–15.37], p=0.002) were also 
identified as independent risk factors. To further evaluate the relevance of the degree of sarcopenia, we graphi￾cally compared HCC recurrence risk of sarcopenic recipients with PM thickness of <12.0mm/m and sarcopenic 
recipients with PM thickness of ≥12.0 mm/m, although statistical analysis could not be performed due to the 
lack of sufficient sample size. As shown in Fig. 2, there was a trend toward a high recurrence risk in sarcopenic 
recipients with lower PM thickness, particularly during the early period (2 years of transplantation), suggesting 
that the degree of sarcopenia is relevant in addition to the presence of sarcopenia. As shown in Fig. 3, there 
was a consistent trend toward higher recurrence risk in recipients with sarcopenia than in recipients without 
sarcopenia irrespective of the presence of other independent risk factors, indicating that there was no interac￾tion effect of sarcopenia with alpha-fetoprotein or microvascular invasion on HCC recurrence and supporting 
the independence of sarcopenia. Moreover, the degree of model fitness was significantly better when the model 
includes sarcopenia in addition to alpha-fetoprotein and microvascular invasion than when the model only 
include alpha-fetoprotein and microvascular invasion (log-likelihood difference=4.6, p=0.032). As shown in 
Fig. 4A, time-dependent C-index was >0.80 in most follow-up period, indicating a strong discrimination abil￾ity, and it was graphically greater when the model includes sarcopenia although statistical difference cannot be 
calculated due to the insufficient sample size. When considering only two preoperative variables (sarcopenia and 
alpha-fetoprotein), incorporation of sarcopenia with alpha-fetoprotein significantly increased the model fitness 
(log-likelihood difference=4.0, p=0.046). Time-dependent C-index was graphically greater when the model 
incorporated sarcopenia with alpha-fetoprotein (Fig. 4B).
Among the 23 recipients who died, 16 died of HCC recurrence and 7 died from HCC-unrelated causes. As 
shown in Fig. 5, there was a trend toward higher HCC-related death risk in sarcopenic patients (HR=3.89 [0.51–
29.49, p=0.154), whereas the risk of HCC-unrelated death was comparable irrespective of the presence of sarco￾penia (HR=1.53 [0.19–12.76], p=0.689). This finding indicates that sarcopenia-related HCC recurrence is an 
important cause of death in patients undergoing liver transplantation for advanced HCC.
Discussion
This study demonstrated that sarcopenia was independently associated with tumor recurrence after LDLT in male 
patients with advanced HCC. The predominant cause of death in sarcopenic recipients was post-transplant HCC 
recurrence. In addition, the current study suggested a possibility that there is a significant degree of heterogeneity 
in tumor recurrence risk even in advanced HCC exceeding the Milan criteria, which is in agreement with recent 
studies suggesting the feasibility of using wider selection criteria for liver transplantation for advanced HCC2,9,10. 
That is, post-transplant HCC recurrence risk can be predicted more precisely based on skeletal muscle mass and 
alpha-fetoprotein, which may help avoid unnecessary discarding of LDLT due to the concern of high recurrence 
risk or help the more cautious selection of recipients who would stand to benefit from LDLT considering the 
potential donor risk1
. Also, the better prediction may provide potential advantages to help physicians guide their 
perioperative clinical decision to adjust recurrence risk in terms of living donor selection, autologous transfu￾sion11, immunosuppression12, and the use of an adjuvant treatment such as sorafenib13.

The mechanism underlying the association between sarcopenia and HCC recurrence is unclear, but may 
be explained by the tumor microenvironment (inflammation and immunity) and cytokine (myokines and adi￾pokines)14. HCC recurrence arises from cancer cells present in the circulation or in micrometastatic colonies 
at the moment of transplantation and those cells can complete the metastatic cascade and reinitiate growth to 
form metastases within a few weeks15. Moreover, the intraoperative and early post-transplant period is a time 
window vulnerable to metastasis because patients experience surgery-induced stress, inflammation, platelet acti￾vation, transfusion, and immunosuppression. Thus, the interaction between HCC cells and the microenviron￾ment during this early period is important. As the largest endocrine organ in the body, skeletal muscle produces 
and releases various physiologically important cytokines and proteins (named myokines) that contribute to the 
tumor microenvironment16. Myokines counteract the harmful effects of proinflammatory adipokines; accord￾ingly, muscle waste tilts the balance to the proinflammatory pathways and results in systemic inflammation as 
well as immune disturbance. For instance, muscle waste results in the increase in IL-6, an inflammatory cytokine 
which is thought to increase the risk of HCC developement14,17. On the other hand, muscle waste results in the 
decrease in the production of IL-15, which plays an important role in inhibiting adipose tissue and reversing

insulin resistance, and the proliferation and development of natural killer (NK) cells16,18. Moreover, the increase 
in adipokines, such as leptin, tumor necrosis factor (TNF-a), and IL-6, reduces the survival of NK cells14,19. These 
interrelations between myokines and adipokines may be related to the recurrence of HCC in sarcopenic patients 
because inflammation and escape from the host immune system are both important components for metastasis16. 
In short, it can be deduced that preoperative sarcopenia that persists during the vulnerable early post-transplant 
period induces a more favorable microenvironment for metastasis of advanced HCC cells via increasing inflam￾mation and decreasing immunity and promotes tumor recurrence. Clinical evidence for the importance of body 
composition (sarcopenia, sarcopenic obesity, visceral obesity, or bone loss) on HCC recurrence after liver resec￾tion6–8
 or liver transplantation20,21 supports the findings of the current study.
Multiple factors produce sarcopenia in patients with chronic liver disease, including loss of appetite, nutri￾ent malabsorption, hypermetabolism, poor hepatic glyconeogenic capacity, and complications such as chronic 
fatigue, portal hypertension, ascites, and encephalopathy3,22. The roles of potential mediators of the liver-muscle 
axis in cirrhosis, such as ammonia, testosterone, and growth hormone, are under investigation22. Cancer cachexia 
also contributes to sarcopenia23, which in part explains the high incidence of sarcopenia in the current cohort 
of patients with advanced HCC. Based on the available evidence of contributors to sarcopenia, various strategies 
to increase skeletal muscle mass and improve outcomes in the non-transplant and post-transplant populations 
have been evaluated. These strategies include supplemental nutrition, physical activity, treating refractory ascites, 
ammonia reduction, and molecular targeted strategies such as myostatin antagonists and mitochondrial protec￾tive agents22.
Despite the high prevalence of sarcopenia and its association with clinical outcomes in cirrhotic patients, 
it is not efficiently incorporated into the clinical practice. One main reason is the lack of readily available, 
easy-to-measure, and objective parameters representing skeletal muscle mass5
. Conventional methods for skele￾tal muscle measurement include anthropometric measurements, laboratory parameters (e.g. albumin), bioelec￾trical impedance, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, and magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Unfortunately, the 
applicability of these methods is limited in cirrhotic patients due to the characteristics of cirrhosis such as edema, 
hypoalbuminemia, and ascites3
. However, recent studies have shown that computed tomography (CT) objectively 
measures skeletal muscle mass and predicts the prognosis in cirrhotic patients4,5,24. In particular, a recent study 
demonstrated that CT can be used as a reliable tool to measure PM thickness and diagnose sarcopenia even in 
ascitic patients and the authors explained that its reliability is attributed to the anatomical distinction between 
ascites and the PM, which is surrounded by retroperitoneal fat tissue and vertebra and is not affected by ascites25. 
Of note, PM thickness, which has been validated in the current and recent studies24,25, can be easily measured in 
a picture archiving and communication system without specific software, allowing it to be more applicable as a 
daily clinical practice.

The recurrence probability at 5 years after transplantation was 35.9% (21.6%–50.4%) in our cohort. As demon￾strated in the current and previous studies, the probability of HCC recurrence after liver transplantation for HCC 
beyond the Milan criteria may vary by cohort according to the respective proportion of high risk and low risk 
recipients. A previous study stratified a validation cohort of 100 patients with HCC beyond the Milan criteria into 
high (n=35) and low (n=65) risk of HCC recurrence according to the alpha-fetoprotein model10. The recur￾rence probability at 5 years post-transplantation was 7.7%–14.4% in the low risk group and 46.3%–47.6% in the 
high risk group, respectively. Our cohort consisted of 44 low risk recipients and 48 high risk recipients according 
to the alpha-fetoprotein model and our recurrence probability is in agreement with the calculated probability 
based on the alpha-fetoprotein model.
Our study model has several advantages in terms of data quality. First, this study included a homogeneous 
LDLT population. All recipients received right hemi-liver graft without variations through a single transplant 
team. All recipients underwent an elective surgery without emergent conditions or acute deterioration. Only 
4 patients had a MELD score >30. Accordingly, thorough perioperative anesthetic and surgical care could be 
performed in an unhurried fashion strictly based on the standardized institutional protocols. Second, recur￾rence evaluation was rigorously performed and there were no follow-up losses; thus, the data regarding the 
time-to-recurrence and time-to-death were highly reliable. Third, biasing effects from HCC-unrelated death was 
another concern because HCC-unrelated death excludes patients from the risk set and changes the recurrence 
probability. Moreover, our previous research demonstrated that the impact of a clinical variable on HCC-related 
death versus HCC-unrelated death can be different26,27. Thus, the Fine and Gray model was used by account￾ing for the competing risk of HCC-unrelated death instead of the standard Cox model. This issue was relevant 
because sarcopenia could also negatively influence the post-transplant outcomes of non-HCC patients and could 
confound the effects on HCC recurrence28–30. Fourth, even though the number of recurrences is apparently small, 
the power of this study to compare the hazard ratios between the sarcopenic group and non-sarcopenic group is 
>90% under the significance level of 5%. The power was calculated after adjustment with variance inflation factor 
(1/0.95) between sarcopenia and two variables (alpha-fetoprotein and microvascular invasion) for the multivar￾iable model expecting the HR 9.4931.
This study has several limitations. First, due to its retrospective nature, a direct cause and effect relationship 
between sarcopenia and HCC recurrence remains unknown. In particular, sarcopenia is a component part of 
cancer cachexia23; thus, it is unclear whether sarcopenia directly impacts the metastasis of HCC cells or if sarco￾penia is an epiphenomenon. In this regard, the effects of anti-sarcopenia treatment on HCC recurrence are also 
unclear and warrant future research. Second, as the first to evaluate the relationship between sarcopenia and 
post-transplant recurrence of HCC beyond the Milan criteria, this study set the cutoff PM thickness at 15.5mm/m 
based on optimal stratification within our data because there are no reference values. Additional research is 
warranted to validate the PM thickness applicable in clinical practice. In particular, the cutoff values might

differ by ethnicity: a previous study of patients listed for transplantation in France set the cutoff at 16.8mm/m24; 
in contrast, another study of ascitic patients in South Korea set the cutoff at 14.0 mm/m25. Sex also affects the 
amount of skeletal muscle mass29; thus, the cutoff value in the current study cannot be translated to female recip￾ients. Third, some tumor cells remain dormant for a long period at the secondary site and initiate growth later15. 
In this setting, metastasis occurs over an extended period of time. Thus, post-transplant long-term change in PM 
thickness may influence HCC recurrence32.
In summary, the risk of tumor recurrence after LDLT for treating HCC beyond the Milan criteria was signifi￾cantly higher in patients with psoas muscle wasting. Despite the methodological limitation, our findings suggest 
that sarcopenia is an important prognostic factor for post-transplant tumor recurrence of advanced HCC.

Subjects. We screened the records of 140 male recipients who underwent a first adult-to-adult LDLT between 
May 2002 and May 2014 in our hospital (200th and 1500th LT cases) and were pathologically diagnosed as HCC 
beyond the Milan criteria without macrovascular invasion. None of the donor livers were procured from prison￾ers. We only included male recipients because reference values for PM thickness can differ by sex4
. We excluded 
3 recipients who underwent cyclosporine-based immunosuppression due to possible tacrolimus toxicity and 2 
recipients due to missing data. Among the remaining 135 recipients, only those with utilizable cross-section 
PM images at the third lumbar vertebra (L3) with CT within 2 months before surgery were included because a 
2-month duration is considered enough for muscle composition to be changed4,7,33. Accordingly, we excluded 15 
recipients in whom the lowest CT image did not reach the L3 level, 20 recipients who had only outside CT images, 
and 8 recipients who underwent CT earlier than 2 months before surgery. The results of the comparison between 
the 92 recipients with an available CT image and 43 recipients without an available CT image are described in 
Supplementary Table S2, implying a low risk of selection bias from the exclusion of 43 recipients.
Data collection. Data were obtained from computerized medical records and a liver transplantation database 
(prospectively collected). Recipients were followed until the end of the study in March 2015. Histology results of 
the removed liver were obtained from the postoperative pathology report. No patients received radiation or adju￾vant chemotherapy for tumor prophylaxis after transplantation. The recurrence of HCC was defined on the basis 
of radiological evidence. Recipients were monitored regularly by measurement of serum alpha-fetoprotein level 
every 1–2 months, and chest radiography and abdominal ultrasonography or CT was used every 3 to 6 months 
to check for evidence of recurrence. When tumor recurrence was suspected, CT, magnetic resonance imaging, 
bone scan, or positron emission tomography scan was used to detect intrahepatic/extrahepatic metastasis. The 
Institutional Review Board of Samsung Medical Center approved this study (SMC 2015-05-002-001) and waived

the requirement for written informed consent. All procedures applied to this study were performed in accordance 
with the relevant guidelines and regulations.
Muscle mass quantification. PM thickness, the largest diameter perpendicular to the longest antero￾posterior axis of the PM including both the psoas major and psoas minor (Fig. 6), was used as a surrogate marker 
of PM mass based on recent studies demonstrating the importance of PM thickness on clinical outcomes in 
cirrhotic patients24,25. PM thickness was measured on the right PM of a single axial CT image at the level of the 
L3 transverse process based on previous studies demonstrating that PM mass measured by CT at the L3 level 
corresponds to whole abdominal skeletal muscle mass and whole body skeletal muscle mass4,33. PM thickness was 
normalized to stature by dividing with height (mm/m)4,24. A single investigator (Y.L.K.) uniformly evaluated all 
CT images on a picture archiving and communication system (PathSpeed, GE Healthcare, Chicago).
Liver transplant indication. Acceptance criteria for liver donation were age ≤65 years, body mass index 
<35 kg/m, macrosteatosis ≤30%, and residual liver volume ≥30%. LT for HCC diagnosed to exceed the Milan 
criteria during preoperative evaluations was performed upon the patient’s and donor’s request after thorough 
explanation of the higher recurrence probability26. Extrahepatic metastasis or macrovascular invasion detected in 
preoperative imaging evaluations was a contraindication for transplantation.
Surgical and anesthetic managements. Surgical and anesthetic management for donors34 and recipi￾ents35 was performed based on standardized institutional protocols, as described previously. In short, all grafts 
consisted of segment 5–8 excluding the middle hepatic vein trunk. Graft implantation was performed using 
the piggyback technique. Blood transfusion was strictly controlled by means of the restrictive and prophylactic 
transfusion strategy35. A blood salvage procedure was routinely used despite the presence of HCC for reducing 
the requirement for allogeneic red blood cell transfusion and its fatal complications11. Immunosuppression was 
performed using the quadruple regimen as described previously26. Induction consisted of bolus steroid injec￾tion, which was tapered by the third month, and basilliximab. Tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil were used 
as maintenance therapy. Tacrolimus treatment was initiated on postoperative day 3, and the blood level was 
adjusted to maintain a daily measured trough plasma concentration of 10ng/mL during the first month, which 
was reduced to 5–8ng/mL thereafter.
Variables and statistical analysis. The primary outcome was overall (intrahepatic or extrahepatic) HCC 
recurrence after transplantation. Post-transplant death was considered the competing risk event and survival 
analysis was performed using the Fine and Gray model36. The cutoff PM thickness for categorizing patients as 
high and low risk of HCC recurrence was set at 15.5mm/m based on optimal stratification by means of the Gray’s 
test statistic (Supplementary Fig. S1)27. The cutoff values for mean trough tacrolimus concentration during the 
first month after transplantation were set at 10ng/mL12. Variables with p<0.05 during univariable analysis were 
included in multivariable analysis and backward stepwise selection was used for generating the final multivariable 
model37. Multicollinearity was tested by means of the variance inflation factor. Interaction effect between sarco￾penia and other contributors for HCC recurrence were graphically tested by means of subgroup analysis while 
the cutoff value for alpha-fetoprotein was set at 100 ng/mL10. The benefit of incorporating sarcopenia into the 
prediction model was statistically tested using the likelihood test and graphically tested using the time-dependent 
receiver operating characteristic curve. Continuous variables are summarized as median (25th percentile, 75th 
percentile), and categorical variables are presented as frequency (%). All reported P values were two-sided and 
p<0.05 was considered statistically significant. Analyses were performed using SPSS 20.0 (IBM Corp., Chicago, 
IL), R 3.0.2 (R Development Core Team, Vienna, Austria; http://www.R-project.org/), or SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute, 
Cary, NC).
