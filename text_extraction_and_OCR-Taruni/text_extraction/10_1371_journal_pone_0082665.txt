Abstract
Aims: To Assess changes in infective endocarditis (IE) epidemiology over the last 5 decades.
Methods and Results: We searched the published literature using PubMed, MEDLINE, and EMBASE from inception
until December 2011.
Data From: Einstein Medical Center, Philadelphia, PA were also included. Criteria for inclusion in this systematic
review included studies with reported IE microbiology, IE definition, description of population studied, and time frame.
Two authors independently extracted data and assessed manuscript quality. One hundred sixty studies (27,083
patients) met inclusion criteria. Among hospital-based studies (n=142; 23,606 patients) staphylococcal IE percentage
increased over time, with coagulase-negative staphylococcus (CNS) increasing over each of the last 5 decades
(p<0.001) and Staphylococcus aureus (SA) in the last decade (21% to 30%; p<0.05). Streptococcus viridans (SV)
and culture negative (CN) IE frequency decreased over time (p<0.001), while enterococcal IE increased in the last
decade (p<0.01). Patient age and male predominance increased over time as well. In subgroup analysis, SA
frequency increased in North America, but not the rest of the world. This was due, in part, to an increase in
intravenous drug abuse IE in North America (p<0.001). Among population-based studies (n=18; 3,477 patients) no
significant changes were found.
Conclusion: Important changes occurred in IE epidemiology over the last half-century, especially in the last decade.
Staphylococcal and enterococcal IE percentage increased while SV and CN IE decreased. Moreover, mean age at
diagnosis increased together with male:female ratio. These changes should be considered at the time of decision￾making in treatment of and prophylaxis for IE.

Introduction
Infective endocarditis (IE) extols a high cost for society
worldwide, with a US incidence of 10,000 to 15,000 cases each
year[1]. IE is associated with prolonged hospitalization, can
require surgery[2], and impairs quality of life[3]. IE was initially
described in 1885 by Osler[4] as a disease of patients with pre￾existing valvular abnormalities. Since then, notable
improvements in IE diagnosis and treatment have been made.
However, in-hospital mortality is still close to 20 percent[5,6].
Risk factors for IE have changed over time. There have been
widespread changes in health-care delivery in the last five
decades, which have impacted the clinical spectrum of IE.
These include the use of intracardiac devices[7], prosthetic
valves[8], hemodialysis[9], and an increase in the elderly
population[10]. Furthermore, changes in antibiotics have led to
alterations in patterns of infection and bacterial resistance in
both the US[11,12] and Europe[13].
In recent decades, several studies have noted an increase in
the proportion of IE caused by staphylococcal species[14,15].
However, others have not[16]. A systematic review of
population-based studies including 15 studies and 2,371 cases
found no significant changes in the causative organism over
time[17]. However, significant limitations were present in this
study, including a low power to detect changes; nor did it cover

the last decade. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, there
are no systematic reviews of hospital based studies.
Proper understanding of IE epidemiology is paramount, as
different organisms produce varied complications and may
require different treatment and prophylaxis[18]. The objective of
this research was to assess whether there have been changes
in IE epidemiology globally over the last half century. Towards
this end, we performed a systematic review of both population
and hospital-based studies.
Methods
Data Sources and Searches
We searched, with no language restrictions, PubMed, OVID/
MEDLINE and EMBASE electronic databases from their
inception to December 2011, for studies reporting infective
endocarditis microbiology. We used the term ‘infective
endocarditis’ for the Mesh keyword. Date last search performed
was December 1st, 2011. We supplemented the search with
references from articles reviewed and correspondence with
other researchers, including experts in the field. When a
reference was deemed potentially suitable for inclusion, a full￾text copy was obtained and reviewed according to predefined
criteria (listed below). We followed the PRISMA guidelines for
systematic reviews.
Study Selection and Data Collection
Prospective and nonprospective studies reporting the
frequency distribution of infective endocarditis in the last five
decades were included in this systematic review. Two
investigators had the protocol for study selection (LS and CD)
and independently assessed the studies for eligibility. Inclusion
criteria were: (1) a clear definition of the population studied; (2)
a clear definition of the time period; (3) a clear definition of
infective endocarditis; and (4) a clear description of the
frequency distribution of the microbiology encountered. In order
to avoid bias, we excluded studies limited to specific
populations (e.g. HIV or intravenous drug users). When there
was difference of opinion, a third investigator (NC) resolved the
disagreement. The authors are fluent in English, Spanish,
Portuguese, and Italian; papers in other languages were
translated by collaborating physicians who were native
speakers. When two studies reported data from the same
cohort and time frame, only the most complete one was
included. If a study reported data for various time frames, data
were analyzed separately for each decade. Kappa (k) for
inclusion was calculated from a sample of 10 randomly
selected papers. Results were compared and inconsistencies
were resolved by consensus. Dr. Andrew Wang from Duke
University was consulted for reviewing the list of included
studies for completeness.
For each study included, the following information was
extracted: first author’s last name, journal, year of publication,
IE definition used, certainty (possible IE vs. definite IE),
countries, time-frame, multi-center vs. single center, sample
size, age, gender, mortality, intravenous drug abuse (IVDA),
intracardiac device or prosthetic valve, Staphylococcus aureus
(SA), coagulase-negative staphylococcus (CNS), enterococci,
Streptococcus viridans (SV) and culture negative (CN) IE.
We also included patients from Einstein Medical Center
(EMC), a tertiary 440-bed city hospital in Philadelphia, PA, US;
for the years 2000 - 2010. Data were retrospectively extracted
per ICD code and then included only if patients met ‘definite’ or
‘possible’ modified Duke criteria[19]. Clinical characteristics
were extracted for each patient as mentioned above. This data
was added as one more study to the last decade. Sensitivity
analyses showed that subtracting this data from the rest did not
modify results significance.
Quality assessment
Two reviewers (LS and CD) independently assessed the
quality of the manuscripts using the approaches recommended
by Khan and colleagues[20] and Stroup and colleagues[21] for
cohort studies. The main criteria were: (1) prospective study,
(2) Duke or Von Reyn definition of IE, (3) definite IE, and (4)
number of patients above 40. Quality was assigned as A, or
excellent, with 4 points, B or good, with 2-3 points, and C, or
suboptimal, with 0-1 points. Data was weighted for quality for
SA and SV without affecting results statistical significance.
Statistical analysis
Data were extracted independently by two researchers (LS
and CD) and collected on an Excel spreadsheet. Data were
allocated to a decade according to the midpoint date for the
time frame studied. For example if the time frame was 1979 to
1983, data was assigned to the 80s. Results are shown as
mean +/- SD, percentages for each decade, and the 95% CI.
Main variables studied were the frequency distribution of
pathogens, patient age and gender, and in-hospital mortality.
ANOVA and Chi2
 test were used to compare studies by
decades. Each group was compared to the rest using paired
Students t-tests. Samples were weighted for size. Results from
our own hospital were included in the last decade and weighted
for size. Sensitivity analysis showed that subtracting this data
did not affect results statistic significance. Moreover subtracting
the biggest study by Murdoch et al. from the International
Collaboration on Endocarditis did not affect statistical
significance of results. Sub-analyses were performed for
continent and IVDA. Correlation between IVDA and SA was
performed using Spearman correlation test. Hospital-based
studies and population-based studies were included. As both
types of studies may be prone to bias (hospital-based studies
to referral bias[22] and population-based studies to selection
bias) hospital-based and population-based studies were
analyzed separately. Sensitivity analyses were performed for
size, single vs multi-center and quality without affecting
significance of results. A p<0.05 was considered statistically
significant. Analyses were performed using JMP version 10.0
(SAS Institute, Cary, NC, US).
Data were presented in a graph as mean (in green,
centerline of diamond) and variance (size of diamond) for each
variable studied in each decade, with standard deviations
(blue). Each dot in a column represents a particular study
percentage. N below decades represents total number of

patients in each decade. Every patient included in each study
was diagnosed with IE as described above.
Results
Candidate studies included 24,415 articles identified in
PubMed, 10,421 in Medline, and 4,528 in EMBASE; one
hundred sixty studies met all inclusion criteria (see flow
diagram in Figure 1). Of these, 142 were hospital-based,
including a total of 23,606 patients (Table 1), and 18 were
population-based, including a total of 3,477 patients (Table 2).
Investigators (LS and CD) were in agreement on which articles
were to be included (k=1).
Hospital-based Studies
Among hospital-based studies, IE epidemiology changed
over the last 5 decades (Figure 2). Patients were significantly
older (Figure 2A; 1980s: mean age 45.3, CI 40.2- 50.5 vs
2000s: mean age 57.2, CI 54.7- 59.7, p<0.001), and more were
men (Figure 2B; 1970s: 58.6%, CI 54.3- 63.0 vs 2000s: 66.3%,
CI 63.6- 69.0, p<0.01). The percentage of IE cases occurring
on prosthetic valves increased over time though with borderline
statistical significance (Figure 2C; 1960s: 8.4%, CI -3.8- 20.5
vs 2000s: 22.9%, CI 19.1 - 26.7, p=0.05).
Changes in microbiology percentage over time are
summarized in Figure 3 and shown in e- Figure 1 for individual
organisms. There were significant increases in frequency
distribution of Staphylococcus aureus (SA, Figure 4A) IE
(1960s: 18.1% CI 9.4- 26.7 vs 2000s: 29.7%, CI 26.2- 33.3,
p<0.05) and coagulase-negative staphylococcus (CNS, Figure
4B) IE (1960s: 2.4%, CI 0.8-5.5 vs 2000s: 10.0%, CI 8.6-11.3,
p<0.01). Enterococcal IE percentage increased significantly
over the last decade (Figure 4C, 1980s: 6.8%, CI 5.4- 8.2 vs
2000s: 10.5%, CI 8.9- 12.1, p<0.001) while culture negative IE
decreased in that time period (Figure 4D, 1980s: 23.1%, CI
15.0- 31.3 vs 2000s: 14.2% CI 9.9- 18.2; p=0.01).
Streptococcus viridans (SV) IE markedly decreased in
percentage over time span of the study (Figure 4E, 1960s:
27.4%, CI 18.4-36.4 vs 2000s: 17.6%, CI 15.7-19.5, p<0.05).
Subgroup analyses, by continent, were performed. The
increase in overall SA frequency was driven by an increase in
North America (Figure 5A; 1960s: 25.3%, CI 13.9- 36.6 vs
2000s: 52.4%, CI 42.4- 62.3, p=0.001). SA percentage in
Europe remained stable over the last 4 decades (Figure 5B;
1970s: 25.1%, CI 18.2- 32.1 vs 2000s: 23.5%, CI 19.1- 28.0,
p=0.70). No significant differences were found in SA IE
frequency in Asia, Africa, Latin America, or Oceania.

Counterbalancing the increase in SA IE percentage in North
America was a decrease in SV IE frequency (1970s: 33.5%, CI
25.8- 41.3 vs 2000s: 14.4%, CI 5.6- 23.2, p<0.01). SV IE
frequency distribution also decreased significantly in Asia
(1970s: 41.5%, CI 28.7- 54.4 vs 2000s: 10.1%, CI -8.9- 29.2,
p<0.01) while in Europe there was a decrease that did not
reach statistical significance (p=0.06). No significant changes
were seen in Latin America and Oceania (p=0.9, p=0.32,
respectively). Insufficient data were available from Africa for
separate analysis.
Subgroup analyses for changes in IVDA IE percentage are
shown in Figure 5. No significant changes were seen on a
global basis. However, a significant increase in IVDA related IE
frequency distribution was observed in North America in the
last decade (Figure 5C; 1980s: 17.3%, CI 10.7- 23.9 vs 2000s:
50.7%, CI 28.5- 73.0, p<0.05). Conversely, we observed a
significant decrease in IVDA related IE percentage in Europe in
the last decade (Figure 5D; 1990s: 21.1%, CI 12.3- 29.8 vs
2000s: 6.8%, CI 3.5- 10.2, p<0.01). We found a positive
correlation between SA IE and IVDA. Interestingly, this
correlation lost strength in the last decade (1990s rs=0.82,
p=0.001 vs 2000s rs=0.40 p=0.05; 1990s vs 2000s, Fisher r-to￾z transformation, p<0.001). We further analyzed the studies
that reported microbiology for the IVDA IE group. Twenty-five
studies and 1288 patients were included in this sub-analysis.
No significant temporal trends in IVDA IE microbiology were
found. In this subset of patients, SA represented the main
pathogen (1970s: 69.89 CI 31.40- 108.38, 1980s: 72.72 CI
57.98- 93.45, 1990s: 61.78 CI 47.87- 75.68 and 2000s: 65.99
CI 55.12- 76.86) and SV represented a small percentage of
cases (1970s: 16.66 CI 3.87- 29.45, 1980s: 8.87 CI 2.79-
14.95, 1990s: 7.37 CI 3.57- 11.19, 2000s: 10.01 CI 7.21-
12.81).
In-hospital mortality rate due to IE decreased following the
1960s and remained stable thereafter (Figure 6; 1960s: 30.6%,
CI 24.4- 36.8 vs 2000s: 19.7%, CI 17.8- 21.6, p=0.01). On
subgroup analysis by continent, no regional differences were
observed.
Population-based Studies
Among population-based studies, no significant trends were
observed regarding IE microbiology as shown in Table 3 (SA
p=0.82; SV p=0.14; enterococci p=0.33). These studies
included populations in the US and Europe primarily. Only one
study was from Asia. Of note, the majority of data from the US
is from Olmstead County, Minnesota.
2000s data from Einstein Medical Center, Philadelphia,
PA, US
We identified a total of 261 cases from 2000 to 2010 (Table
4). Mean age was 59 and 49% were male. In-hospital mortality
rate was 25⋅3%. Prosthetic IE represented 10.7% and IVDA
14.6%. SA was the primary IE microorganism seen causing
48.3% of IE [25.3% Methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus
(MSSA) and 23.0% Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus
(MRSA)] while CNS was seen in 6.9% of the cases.
Enterococcus was the IE etiology in 19.2% and SV 9.6%.
Culture negative IE represented 3.8%. Removal of this data did
not modify overall results.
Discussion
The main finding of this study is that the epidemiology of IE
has changed worldwide over the last half century. Furthermore,
the observed changes in IE microbiology varied by continent.

These findings stemmed from analyses of hospital-based
reports. In a separately analyzed smaller group of population￾based studies (most of them from the US), no consistent
changes in IE microbiology frequency distribution over time
were observed.
Most notably, the global percentage of SA IE has nearly
doubled in the last five decades (18% in the 1960s to nearly
30% in the 2000s). When analyzed by continent this increase
was largely due to an increased frequency of SA in North
America (from 25% in the 1960s to 52% in the 2000s) with no
significant change among reports from other continents. This
finding has important implications as SA infections are
associated with longer length of stay, higher death rates[23],
increase hospitalizations[24], and elevated costs[24]. An
increase in IVDA IE percentage in North America as compared
to Europe may partially explain these changes in SA frequency
distribution. However, the number of studies in the last decade
in this analysis is small and therefore this finding should be
studied further. Other potential contributors include increases in
the elderly population[10], increased numbers of chronically-ill
patients[25], increased contacts with the health-care
system[26,27], and increasing use of intracardiac and vascular
devices. Benito and colleagues[27] found a high percentage of
health-care associated infections (related to catheters, dialysis,
or immunosuppressive therapy) among US patients with native
valve IE; SA was the most common organism isolated. Though
the present study was not able to specifically track cardiac
device implantation, another recent study found an increased
prevalence of staphylococcal IE in these patients[28]. In
absolute numbers Bor et al, reported an incidence of infective
endocarditis in the US close to 40,000 cases/year [29].
Furthermore, at least when measured by ICD codes the total
number of SA cases seems to be increasing in the US [15]. In
addition, certain subgroups may behave differently; a well￾designed population based study found that SA frequency has
increased in Europe in patients without previously known valve
disease[5]. It is important to clarify that changes in individual
countries may not necessarily follow the trends at a continent
level.

The present study also documents a substantial decline in
the frequency of SV IE over the last five decades (27.4% in the
1960s to 17.6% in the 2000s). This finding was statistically
significant for North America and Asia with a strong trend in
Europe. Therefore, it appears that changes in the epidemiology
of this organism are more widespread than for SA.
Paralleling the increase in SA IE frequency, there was also
an increase in CNS IE percentage over time. It is known that
CNS infections are often related to the use of intravascular
catheters and prosthetic vascular grafts[30]. Thus, the rise in
CNS IE may well be health-care related.
Enterococcal IE frequency increased in the last decade of
the study. Enterococcal infections typically affect elderly
patients and those with prior valvular damage, diabetes
mellitus, indwelling catheters, or who are on hemodyalisis[31].
This finding is extremely important given the high prevalence of
multidrug resistant enterococci and therefore the implications
on treatment options. Lastly, culture negative endocarditis
percentage decreased in the last decade. This is likely because
of improved laboratory techniques and culture methods.
Worldwide, the present study found increases in age among
IE patients. This has important implications for treatment and
use of health care resources as elderly patients have more
comorbidities and may be more prone to infection with certain
organisms, such as enterococci. Consistent with the general
perception[18], the present study found that in-hospital
mortality rate of IE remains high with no significant decrease
observed since the 1960s.
A limitation of the present study is the lack of individual
patient level data. This data was not available from older

studies and including it for only the last decades would have
changed one bias for another one, without adding accuracy.
Another limitation is that most of the findings come from
hospital-based studies, whereas no significant changes were
seen in the population based-studies over time. One possible
explanation for this is a lack of power (18 population-based
studies covering 3,477 patients vs 142 hospital-based studies
covering 23,606 patients). Population-studies are also subject
to sample bias: the population studied may not truly represent
the general population. They can be subject to underreporting,
as many times they rely on surveys. Moreover, population￾studies of IE in the US are mainly from the Olmstead County, a
population that is unlikely to represent the total US population.
Hospital-based studies can suffer from referral bias as well,
with sicker patients being referred to specialized centers. Thus,
these results might not apply to community hospitals. However,
Kanafani and colleagues[32] found only a slight difference
between referred and non-referred patients, with higher SA IE
in the non-referred patients. Thus, had this played a role in the
present study, it would have likely decreased SA frequency.
Therefore, it is unlikely to explain our findings. Finally, the

Figure 6. In-Hospital Mortality of Infectious Endocarditis. Figure shows percentage of in-hospital mortality of Infectious
Endocarditis in each decade (mean in green, centerline of diamond) and variance (as size of diamond) plus standard deviation
(blue). Each dot in column represents a particular study mean. N below decades represents total number of patients in each
decade. In-hospital mortality decreased after the 1960s and remained stable thereafter. ∗∗=p<0.01.

Changes in Infective Endocarditis Epidemiology
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 12 December 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 12 | e82665

definition of IE has changed over time, as well as culture
quality, which could have caused heterogeneity in the cases
included.
Conclusion
The present study represents the largest systematic review
of IE epidemiology to date. Important findings include an
increase in staphylococcal IE frequency over the last half￾century, particularly in North America, and a worldwide
decrease in SV IE percentage. In the last decade SA IE and
enterococci IE frequencies have increased while culture
negative IE has decreased. Patients with IE are getting older
and the male to female ratio is increasing. Mortality has
changed little in the last four decades.
