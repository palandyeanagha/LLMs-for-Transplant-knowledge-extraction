ABSTRACT
Background: Sleep hypoventilation has been proposed
as a cause of progressive hypercapnic respiratory failure
and death in patients with severe chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (COPD). A study was undertaken to
determine the effects of nocturnal non-invasive bi-level
pressure support ventilation (NIV) on survival, lung
function and quality of life in patients with severe
hypercapnic COPD.
Method: A multicentre, open-label, randomised con￾trolled trial of NIV plus long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT)
versus LTOT alone was performed in four Australian
University Hospital sleep/respiratory medicine depart￾ments in patients with severe stable smoking-related
COPD (forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1.0)
,1.5 litres or ,50% predicted and ratio of FEV1.0 to
forced vital capacity (FVC) ,60% with awake arterial
carbon dioxide tension (PaCO2) .46 mm Hg and on LTOT
for at least 3 months) and age ,80 years. Patients with
sleep apnoea (apnoea-hypopnoea index .20/h) or morbid
obesity (body mass index .40) were excluded. Outcome
measures were survival, spirometry, arterial blood gases,
polysomnography, general and disease-specific quality of
life and mood.
Results: 144 patients were randomised (72 to NIV +
LTOT and 72 to LTOT alone). NIV improved sleep quality
and sleep-related hypercapnia acutely, and patients
complied well with therapy (mean (SD) nightly use 4.5
(3.2) h). Compared with LTOT alone, NIV (mean follow-up
2.21 years, range 0.01–5.59) showed an improvement in
survival with the adjusted but not the unadjusted Cox
model (adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 0.63, 95% CI 0.40 to
0.99, p = 0.045; unadjusted HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.53 to
1.25, p = NS). FEV1.0 and PaCO2 measured at 6 and
12 months were not different between groups. Patients
assigned to NIV + LTOT had reduced general and mental
health and vigour.
Conclusions: Nocturnal NIV in stable oxygen-dependent
patients with hypercapnic COPD may improve survival, but
this appears to be at the cost of worsening quality of life.
Trial registration number: ACTRN12605000205639
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
remains a leading cause of death and disability
worldwide.1 Long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) was
shown in the 1980s to increase survival.2 3 However,
patients with severe COPD continue to suffer major
disability and require frequent and costly medical
intervention. Once hypercapnia develops, 2-year
mortality is approximately 30–40%.4
Many patients with COPD have worsening of
hypoxaemia and hypercapnia in sleep, particularly
in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, due to a fall
in central respiratory drive and increased upper
airways resistance.5–8 Nocturnal gas exchange
disturbance in COPD may potentially predispose
to cardiac arrhythmias and progressive daytime
ventilatory failure. The clear benefit of non￾invasive ventilation (NIV) in acute exacerbations
of COPD,9 plus the overwhelming evidence that
nocturnal NIV improves hypercapnic ventilatory
failure, quality of life (QOL) and survival in
restrictive chest wall disease and neuromuscular
disease,10–12 has raised the possibility that NIV may
also improve QOL and survival in patients with
end stage COPD. A number of short-term studies
have shown improvements in sleep quality, sleep
gas exchange and awake arterial carbon dioxide
tension (PaCO2).13 Two recent longer-term rando￾mised controlled trials of NIV + LTOT versus
LTOT alone involving larger patient samples
reported small benefits in favour of NIV.14 15 One
showed a small improvement in patient dyspnoea
scores,14 while the other reported slightly
decreased awake PaCO2 and improved dyspnoea
and health-related QOL.15 The general consensus,
however, is that there is insufficient evidence to
recommend NIV for routine use in stable hyper￾capnic COPD.13 16
The present multicentre study was designed to
investigate this question further. Patients with
COPD with severe airflow limitation and stable
hypercapnic ventilatory failure were randomised to
either NIV + LTOT or LTOT alone and followed
for up to 5 years. The primary outcome measure
was survival. Secondary outcome measures
included general and disease-specific QOL, mood
and awake arterial blood gases.
METHODS
The Australian trial of non-invasive Ventilation in
Chronic Airflow Limitation (AVCAL) was a
randomised open-label controlled trial conducted
between 1998 and 2004 in four Australian uni￾versity hospitals: the Repatriation General
Hospital, Adelaide, South Australia; the Royal
Prince Alfred Hospital, Sydney, New South
Wales; the Austin Hospital, Melbourne, Victoria;
and the Charles Gairdner Hospital, Perth, Western
Australia. The first patient was randomised on 30
June 1998 and the last on 28 March 2003. The trial
was terminated on 15 May 2004.
Inclusion criteria were: (1) men and women aged
,80 years; (2) severe COPD secondary to smoking
(forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1.0) ,1.5 litres
or ,50% predicted, ,20% improvement in

FEV1.0 following aerosol bronchodilator, and ratio of FEV1.0 to
forced vital capacity (FVC) ,60%); (3) stable hypercapnic
ventilatory failure (PaCO2 .46 mm Hg at least twice in the
previous 6 months during periods of clinical stability; (4) on
LTOT17 for at least 3 months and, as required for LTOT
prescription, not currently smoking. Exclusion criteria were:
(1) significant co-morbidity such as malignancy, left ventri￾cular heart failure or unstable angina likely to affect survival in
the 2-year follow-up period; (2) severe psychiatric disorder
likely to impair ability to comply with NIV; (3) body mass
index (BMI) .40 kg/m2
; (4) polysomnographic evidence of
sleep apnoea (.20 apnoeas plus hypopnoeas per hour of
sleep).
Randomisation and interventions
All patients underwent a full-night attended polysomnography
at their prescribed LTOT flow rate that included EEG, EOG,
submental EMG, airflow (oronasal thermistors), respiratory
effort (chest and abdominal inductance bands), pulse oximetry
and continuous transcutaneous PCO2 recording (Radiometer,
TCM3, Denmark). Supine resting arterial blood gases were
taken in the sleep laboratory prior to sleep and on first waking
on both occasions with the patient breathing oxygen via nasal
cannulae at their prescribed flow rate. Where necessary, these
arterial blood gas values were used to correct for across-the￾night transcutaneous carbon dioxide membrane and machine
drift using a method of linear interpolation as described
previously.7 Unless patients were unwilling or unable to tolerate
room air breathing without their oxygen therapy, an awake
morning arterial blood gas sample was also taken on room air.
Sleep studies were scored by experienced sleep scorers who were
blinded to treatment allocation.18 Apnoeas were defined as an
absence of oronasal flow for .10 s and hypopnoeas as a .50%
reduction in flow lasting more than 10 s with or without
arousal or desaturation .3%. Lung function measurements
including forced expiratory and static lung volumes and gas
transfer were reported as absolute values and as percentage
predicted using the normal values employed in the laboratories
at the time. General QOL was assessed using the SF36
questionnaire and disease-specific QOL by the St Georges
Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ).
Patients were randomly assigned to the treatment group
which received NIV plus usual care including LTOT, or to the
control group which received LTOT and usual care. The central
study coordinator generated a random sequence of treatment
assignments that were stratified by centre and distributed in
blocks of 10 sealed opaque envelopes to the centres. The central
coordinator verified that the patient met all eligibility criteria
before the site research nurse broke the envelope seal.
The protocol for NIV initiation and aftercare was standar￾dised between centres at an initial workshop of research nurses.
Regular telephone conferences were conducted thereafter to
assist with protocol queries or specific management issues and
another face-to-face calibration workshop was held mid-study.
Patients assigned to NIV treatment were admitted to hospital
for 3–4 days for education and familiarisation with the patient
triggered bi-level positive pressure device (VPAPs-mode,
ResMed, Sydney, Australia). Expiratory positive airway pressure
(EPAP) was set at the lowest possible level (approx 3 cm H2O)
and the inspiratory positive airway pressure (IPAP) gradually
increased during daytime and night time trials to the maximum
tolerated with a target IPAP–EPAP difference of 10 cm H2O or
greater. The choice of nasal versus full face mask and
humidification was determined by the nurse to maximise
patient comfort and NIV efficiency. On the third or fourth
night the subject had another attended polysomnographic study
during which EPAP was increased as necessary to abolish
snoring and obstructive hypopnoeas/apnoeas. NIV was con￾sidered successfully established when at least 3 h of sleep were
confirmed on NIV at an IPAP–EPAP difference of at least
5 cm H2O. If these criteria were not met, patients had another
therapeutic sleep study. If the criteria were again not met,
attempts to provide ventilatory assistance with NIV were
considered to have failed and the patient was withdrawn from
NIV but follow-up measurements were made and the data
included in the intention-to-treat analysis. Patients telephoned
the research nurse for advice if difficulties were being
encountered at home with NIV, and additional visits with the
nurses either in the home or hospital were arranged as required.
Outcomes and follow-up
For all patients a research nurse attempted telephone contact at
6-week intervals to first ascertain live/dead status and, if the
patient had died, date of death either from the next of kin,
general practitioner or state death register. For surviving
patients, the hour meter values on the NIV and/or oxygen
concentrator devices were read out by the patient or family
member and recorded. Average daily use of NIV and LTOT was
calculated as the meter reading increment divided by the total
number of days since the last meter reading. The duration of all
patient-reported hospital admissions was recorded. Surviving
patients were asked to return at 6-monthly intervals for repeat
lung function and arterial blood gas measurements and QOL
assessments. At these visits, the hour meter on NIV devices was
read by the research nurse.
Data analysis and statistics
The study was powered with survival as the primary outcome
variable. We attempted to recruit 100 subjects in each group
based on the following initial assumptions: 2-year study;
underlying 2-year survival rate in the LTOT group of 60%;
NIV would increase survival rate to 80%; average loss to follow￾up of 15% over 2 years; 80% power using a 0.05 level two-sided
log-rank test for equality of survival curves (nQuery Advisor

4.0). In practice, recruitment rates were much slower than
anticipated. To adjust for this, the length of the periods for
recruitment and follow-up were extended substantially.
Statistical analyses were undertaken using SPSS 16 for
Windows (SPSS, Chicago, Illinois, USA) and Stata 10 (College
Station, Texas, USA). All primary analyses were conducted on
an intention-to-treat basis. However, since a proportion of
patients assigned to NIV treatment did not use the treatment
regularly or abandoned it altogether after a time, a planned per
protocol subanalysis was conducted comparing outcomes of
patients in the treatment arm who used NIV consistently
(defined as average of .4 h per night) with patients in the
control arm.
A Cox survival analysis was performed. Baseline measures
were first assessed for confounding by determining if the
addition of the variable to the crude model changed the hazard
ratio by 10% or more. PaO2, PaCO2 and the SGRQ Total Score
were found to be confounding variables and were therefore
included in the final model. Missing values were imputed by the
approach of expectation-maximisation. A global test of the
proportional hazards assumption based on Schoenfeld residuals
was undertaken. The crude and adjusted hazard ratios with
95% confidence intervals for NIV + LTOT treatment versus
LTOT alone are reported.
Random effects modelling was undertaken on arterial blood
gas and FEV1.0 and FVC data. The combined effects of a high
mortality rate in the study population and an inability or
reluctance on the part of patients to return to hospital for repeat
testing towards the end of the follow-up period meant that
there were a number of missing data for QOL and physiological
measurements after 12 months of follow up. Statistical analyses
of these data have therefore been confined to the first
12 months of the trial. Even so, the severity of the patients’
respiratory disease meant that there remained missing values
and patients were often unwilling or unable to come off oxygen
for blood gas measurements while air breathing or to perform
pulmonary function tests both before and after bronchodilator
treatment, and prescribed oxygen flow rate had sometimes
changed between measurements. To select comparable data
from the maximum possible number of patients in both
treatment arms, arterial blood gas and lung function data have
been matched for equivalent conditions (including oxygen flow
rate for arterial blood gas tensions on oxygen) at baseline, 6 and
12 months in each patient. Partial data were included if baseline
and one other visit data were available.
Owing to the highly skewed nature of most QOL and mood,
ranked analysis of covariance was used to compare mean rank
scores at 12 months in the two treatment groups after
adjustment for ranked baseline values. Patient hospitalisation
rates in the two groups were compared using the large sample
Z-test.
RESULTS
One hundred and forty-four patients met the eligibility criteria
and were randomised, 72 to the NIV+LTOT group and 72 to the
LTOT group. Table 1 shows the baseline characteristics of the
patients in the two groups. As expected, approximately two￾thirds of subjects with COPD were male, with a mean age in the
late 60s. Patients had severe airflow obstruction, very low
carbon monoxide gas transfer consistent with severe emphy￾sema and significant awake hypoxaemia and hypercapnia while
breathing room air. The baseline SGRQ scores indicate that
patients were severely disabled by their respiratory disease.
Table 2 shows the baseline sleep study findings in the two
groups and the effects of positive pressure ventilation on sleep
architecture and the sleep-related rise in transcutaneous PCO2.
As expected, sleep efficiency was very low, there was a marked
rise in transcutaneously measured PCO2 during sleep and the
frequency of apnoeas and hypopnoeas was low. The sleep study
following in-hospital implementation of NIV in the treatment
group showed small but significant increases in REM sleep and
decreases in the frequency of disordered breathing events and
sleep-related rise in transcutaneous PCO2. Patients were able to
tolerate moderate IPAP and EPAP levels.
Median follow-up time was 28.5 months in the NIV+LTOT
group and 20.5 months in the LTOT group. Only eight patients
(5.5%) were lost to follow-up, four in LTOT and four NIV +
LTOT treatment arms. The mean (SEM) flow rate and
adherence to oxygen therapy computed to the time of death
or last follow-up did not differ between the two arms of the
study (NIV + LTOT: 1.9 (0.6) l/min, 18.8 (0.6) h/day; LTOT:
1.9 (0.1) l/min, 18.8 (0.6) h/day; p = NS). Mean (SD) adherence
to NIV for those assigned to this therapy was 4.5 (3.2) h/night;
41/72 patients (60%) used NIV for .4 h/night and were
included in the per protocol analysis.
The number of deaths per treatment arm was 40 for NIV +
LTOT and 46 for LTOT alone. The adjusted survival analysis
showed a survival advantage in favour of the NIV + LTOT
group for both intention to treat (hazard ratio (HR) 0.63 (95%
CI 0.40 to 0.99); p = 0.045) and per protocol analyses (HR 0.57

was not significantly different from 1 (HR 0.82 (95% CI 0.53 to
1.25)). The adjusted survival curves for the intention-to-treat
analysis are shown in fig 2.
No differences were observed between the two groups in
PaO2, PaCO2 or FEV1.0 in the first 12 months of follow-up
(table 3). Other parameters of lung function (gas transfer factor,
static lung volumes) also showed no statistically significant
differences.
Disease-specific QOL (SGRQ) at 12 months was not different
between the NIV + LTOT and LTOT alone groups. However,
statistically significant differences were observed in several
subscales of the SF36 (table 4) and profile of mood states
(POMS, table 5) questionnaires, suggesting that patients treated
with NIV had poorer general and mental health and reported
less vigour and more confusion and bewilderment.
Hospitalisation rates were not different between the two
groups (LTOT vs LTOT + NIV: days on trial 54 708 vs
62 182; days in hospital 1697 vs 2020; rate 0.031 vs 0.032; rate
ratio 0.96 (95% CI 0.90 to 1.02), p = 0.161 based on large sample
Z-test.
DISCUSSION
This study is the largest randomised controlled trial reported
to date of non-invasive bi-level positive pressure treatment
during sleep in stable end-stage hypercapnic COPD. At baseline,
patients showed evidence of poor quality sleep and significant
hypoventilation, and those assigned to NIV treatment
demonstrated modest improvements in sleep architecture
and sleep hypoventilation with the application of NIV
treatment. Patients on NIV adhered well to the therapy (mean
4.5 h/night) over the period of follow-up. After adjusting for
baseline differences in clinically important variables, NIV
treatment was shown to produce an improvement in survival
but no change in daytime arterial blood gas or lung function
measurements or hospitalisation rates. Disease-specific and
general QOL did not improve as a result of NIV treatment. On
the contrary, it appeared that the addition of NIV to usual care
in these severely disabled COPD patients resulted in deteriora￾tion in general and mental health and some aspects of mood.
This is the first randomised controlled trial to show an
improvement in survival with the application of nocturnal NIV
in end-stage chronic hypercapnic COPD. The survival advantage
was apparent on the adjusted but not the crude survival
analysis. Survival advantage was slightly greater in the
per protocol analysis (ie, restricted to patients who complied
.4 h/night with NIV treatment) than the intention-to-treat
analysis, suggesting that the nightly duration of NIV treatment
was an important determinant of outcome. That survival
improved without any change in daytime arterial blood gases
was surprising since clinical gains from NIV in other forms of
chronic respiratory disease (eg, obesity-hypoventilation syn￾drome, neuromuscular weakness) are normally accompanied by
improvements in daytime blood gases as well as nocturnal gas
exchange. It is possible that in our study the level of ventilatory
support was sufficient to be cardioprotective but not to improve
awake central respiratory drive. Patients with severe COPD
have a high prevalence of cardiovascular disease.19 It is
conceivable that patients with severe COPD may be prone to
sudden cardiac death secondary to sleep-disordered breathing.
Unfortunately we did not collect data on the mode or time of
death which may have shed light on this possibility.
Two previous randomised controlled trials of sleep NIV
therapy in hypercapnic COPD that followed patients for
12–24 months14 15 reported an improvement in patient dys￾pnoea scores with NIV and one reported a small improvement

either withdrew their consent to be further contacted or were found to be
non-contactable. Their data were included in the survival analysis to the
time of the last follow-up. {Three patients in the LTOT alone group
crossed over to NIV treatment during the study and were excluded from
the per protocol analysis.

ventilation plus long-term oxygen therapy (NIV + LTOT) and long-term
oxygen therapy (LTOT) alone. Curves were constructed after adjustment
for confounding by baseline differences in arterial oxygen and carbon

the small number of patients followed up for 3 or more years, there is
considerable uncertainty about the true shape of the extreme right-hand
end of the survival plots.

in daytime PaCO2 on usual oxygen therapy but not while
breathing ambient air. Neither study found any survival
advantage for NIV, but both studies were significantly under￾powered to examine mortality.
The survival benefit observed in our study was of borderline
statistical significance. Our data, however, suggest that
ventilatory support at night was incomplete, which may have
limited the potential treatment benefit. Average NIV compli￾ance was 4.5 h/night and NIV failed to normalise sleep
architecture and gas exchange during sleep. Others have
suggested that the level of inspiratory pressure delivered by
NIV may be a crucial factor in determining treatment
response.16 Our average IPAP–EPAP difference was 8 cm H2O
and average IPAP 13 cm H2O, which are similar14 or slightly
lower15 pressures to those reported in the other two longer term
randomised controlled trials. It is possible that the use of higher
levels of IPAP may result in greater treatment benefits.
Recently, a retrospective study reported using IPAP levels
ranging from 17 to 40 cm H2O in patients with hypercapnic
COPD20 with subsequent reduction in awake PaCO2 and some
improvement in FEV1.0 after 2 months and a 2-year survival of
86%. However, there was no control group and patients also
received daytime ventilation. There are no randomised con￾trolled trial data available to date in patients with hypercapnic
COPD to assess the tolerability of NIV delivered in this fashion
or its effects on survival and QOL.
As shown by the SGRQ, our patients had severe disease￾specific impairment of QOL and we failed to detect any change
in SGRQ in either arm of the study. Clini et al,
15 in a similar
long-term randomised controlled trial to ours, showed improve￾ment in NIV-treated patients with COPD in disease-specific
QOL using the the Maugeri Foundation Respiratory Failure
questionnaire (MRF-28) but not the SGRQ.15 It has been
suggested that the MRF-28 may be a more sensitive instrument
to measure disease-specific QOL treatment effects in patients
with respiratory failure.15 21 The other long-term randomised
controlled trial of NIV in hypercapnic COPD14 did not report
health-related QOL. Two short-term studies of 8 and 12 weeks,
respectively,22 23 reported improvements in disease-specific QOL
following NIV, but the relevance of these data to long-term NIV
use in this patient group is uncertain.
Ours is the first long-term randomised controlled trial of
NIV in hypercapnic COPD to assess health status using
validated general QOL and mood questionnaires. To our
surprise, we found that patients on NIV had more confusion/
bewilderment and less vigour on the POMS than those
receiving oxygen therapy alone. This deterioration was
matched by worsening SF36 measured QOL in the NIV arm
of the study with poorer scores for general and mental health.
There was no improvement in the vitality subscale of the
SF36, in contrast to increased vitality usually seen following
NIV intervention in other forms of sleep-related respiratory
failure.24 The general worsening of mood and QOL may reflect
the relative additional complexity of therapy associated with
NIV in the absence of perceived improvement in health status.
Alternatively, a survivor effect in the NIV group could lead to
an apparent worsening of mood and QOL (ie, patients living
longer with end-stage COPD may report more disturbances in
mood and QOL) and is hard to distinguish from a true
negative effect of therapy. Nevertheless, these findings
emphasise the need to closely measure QOL in future
randomised controlled trials in this patient group. Small gains
in survival from NIV may potentially be negated by
decrements in QOL.

Values are mean (95% CI). Sample sizes are unequal because patient data were censored if it was not possible to obtain
measurements under the same conditions (FEV1.0 prebronchodilator; arterial blood gases on room air or on oxygen at the same
flow rate) on at least two of three occasions.

A limitation of the study was our difficulty in recruitment
and subsequent loss of power for the primary survival analysis.
Another limitation was the loss of follow-up data for the
secondary outcome measures due to the combined effects of a
high mortality rate and an inability or reluctance of patients to
return to hospital for repeat testing. This reflects the nature and
disability in patients with end-stage COPD and geographical
limitations of the study centres in the Australian setting.
In summary, this study is the first to demonstrate a survival
advantage for chronic NIV in hypercapnic COPD. While these
results are encouraging, our enthusiasm for NIV treatment is
tempered by the observation that it was accompanied by
reduced self-reported QOL. Whether the latter can be improved
by more effective education, ventilator settings or mask
technology needs further study. For now, we recommend that
NIV in hypercapnic COPD be confined to patients enrolled in
new randomised controlled trials.
