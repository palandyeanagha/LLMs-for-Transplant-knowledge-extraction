Isolated amyloidosis of the heart was described at autopsy in 
the mid-nineteenth century.1
 Later studies distinguished atrial 
(composed of fibrils derived from atrial natriurietic peptide) 
from ventricular deposition.2,3 Congestive heart failure and 
arrhythmias occurred almost exclusively in subjects with sig￾nificant ventricular deposition. In contrast to the mutant forms 
of transthyretin (TTR) comprising the fibrils in tissue deposits 
in familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy (FAP) with significant 
cardiomyopathy (OMIM 1105210.0009),4
 molecular studies 
of hearts performed during autopsies of elderly Swedish sub￾jects with congestive heart failure established that the amyloid 
deposits were composed of wild-type TTR.5,6
ATTR V122I (pV142I)
Amyloid fibrils extracted from the heart of an elderly patient 
with isolated cardiac amyloidosis and no family history were 
composed of TTR with a substitution of isoleucine for valine 
at position 122 (TTR V122I; pV142I).7
 DNA from the subject 
demonstrated homozygosity of the C → G transition, which 
caused the substitution, suggesting recessive inheritance; how￾ever, subsequent reports of similarly affected patients revealed 
homozygous and heterozygous V122I mutations, indicating 
dominant heredity.6
THE TTR GENE AND PROTEIN
TTR is a 55-kDa homotetramer with binding sites for thyrox￾ine (T4) and retinol binding protein charged with retinol.8
 In 
humans, it is the major serum carrier of retinol bound to reti￾nol binding protein and a minor serumT4 transporter. It is the 
only carrier of T4 in the cerebrospinal fluid, which provides the 
hormone to the CNS during development.9
 TTR is encoded 
by a conserved single gene on chromosome 18.10 Most of the 
circulating protein is synthesized by hepatocytes, but there is 
also synthesis by retinal and choroid plexus epithelial cells, 
pancreatic α-cells, Schwann cells, and neurons under stress.11–13
Mice with both copies of the gene silenced display a behavioral 
abnormality throughout life, and it has been suggested that 
they exhibit a physical developmental delay that normalizes in 
young adults.14–16
THE MECHANISM OF TTR AMYLOID FIBRIL 
FORMATION
Biophysical studies with purified recombinant TTR V122I 
revealed that, in contrast to the thermodynamically unstable 
FAP mutant TTR’s V30M and L55P, its tetramer was kineti￾cally unstable relative to the wild-type, i.e., the rate of tetramer 
dissociation was high enough to provide a pool of misfolded

Since the identification of a valine-to-isoleucine substitution at posi￾tion 122 (TTR V122I; pV142I) in the transthyretin (TTR)-derived 
fibrils extracted from the heart of a patient with late-onset cardiac 
amyloidosis, it has become clear that the amyloidogenic mutation 
and the disease occur almost exclusively in individuals of identifi￾able African descent. In the United States, the amyloidogenic allele 
frequency is 0.0173 and is carried by 3.5% of community-dwelling 
African Americans. Genotyping across Africa indicates that the ori￾gin of the allele is in the West African countries that were the major 
source of the slave trade to North America. At autopsy, the allele was 
found to be associated with cardiac TTR amyloid deposition in all 
the carriers after age 65 years; however, the clinical penetrance varies, 
resulting in substantial heart disease in some carriers and few symp￾toms in others. The allele has been found in 10% of African Ameri￾cans older than age 65 with severe congestive heart failure. At this 
time there are potential forms of therapy in clinical trials. The com￾bination of a highly accurate genetic test and the potential for specific 
therapy demands a greater awareness of this autosomal dominant, 
age-dependent cardiac disease in the cardiology community.

POPULATION GENETICS IN THE UNITED STATES
The first three TTR V122I probands were African Americans, 
suggesting that the allele might be enriched in populations of 
African descent. Table 1 summarizes the results of studies of 
TTR V122I carrier prevalence in African Americans. The com￾bined allele frequency is 0.0173, with a predicted occurrence in 
homozygotes of 3×10−4 by approximating the number found in 
population studies, which is consistent with Hardy-Weinberg 
equilibrium. Two studies of African-American newborns 
did not reveal significant differences in the allele frequency 
between infants and adults, suggesting that in the United States 
there was no selective advantage or disadvantage of the allele 
for reaching adulthood; this observation replicated in Ghana.18
Because V122I-associated disease typically occurs in the sev￾enth or eighth decade of life in heterozygotes, it is unlikely to 
affect reproductive fitness. Genotyping for the allele across 
Africa revealed the highest prevalence in West Africa, which 
is the ancestral home of African slaves transported to North 
America (Figure 2).19
In the United States, the allele frequency in individuals with￾out documented African origin is very low.20 However, allele 
carriers of uncertain African descent have been identified in the 
United Kingdom, Italy, and France. Studies designed to estab￾lish their ancestry are in progress.21–23
The V122I amino acid variant is encoded in the genome in 
the single-nucleotide polymorphism rs76992529. The G → A 
transition resulting in the amyloidogenic TTR allele involves a 
CpG dinucleotide, a structure suggested to be a mutational “hot 
spot”; therefore, it is possible that non-African relatives carry 
mutations that originated independently.24
DISEASE ASSOCIATIONS
Case studies
Case reports of homozygous and heterozygous TTR V122I 
carriers (including a family with a homozygous parent and 
heterozygous child) indicated that homozygous individuals 
became symptomatic in their late 50s and early 60s, whereas 
heterozygotes developed congestive heart failure between the 
ages of 60 and 80.25,26 The cardiac amyloid was usually identified 
at autopsy.
Autopsy series
Investigation of material from 52,000 autopsies performed at 
the Los Angeles County–USC Medical Center (1949–1982) 
revealed that isolated cardiac amyloidosis was twice as common 
in elderly African Americans as in comparably aged Caucasians 
and was 10 times more common than in Hispanics of Mexican 
origin.27 Ninety-five percent of hearts with isolated amyloid 
deposition contained TTR.28 All of the Caucasians were pre￾sumed to be of the V122V wild-type TTR genotype. Six of the 
12 African-American hearts that were genetically evaluable 
were positive for TTR V122I, suggesting that the allele was 
responsible for at least half of the late-onset cardiac TTR amy￾loidosis in this population. However, for these subjects iden￾tified in the pre-echocardiographic era, there was insufficient 
information to determine clinical penetrance.
In the same study, tissues from 112 consecutive autopsies of 
African Americans aged 65 or over that were performed at the 
same institution between 1984 and 1985 were genotyped for the 
TTR V122I encoding allele. Four of the samples (3.6%, a figure 
remarkably close to the prevalence in living African Americans) 
were positive for the amyloidogenic allele. Re-examination of 
Figure 1 Possible dissociation pathways of human transthyretin 
tetramer. The TTR homotetramer dissociates into homodimers and then 
monomers, which represent the fibril precursor. The most likely dissociation 
pathway is shown by the red arrows. The rates of misfolding and aggregation 
of the monomers into oligomers, protofibrils, and then fibrils are very slow 
under physiologic conditions. The process is accelerated by mutations in the 
transthyretin gene or posttranslational changes in the peptide, including 
proteolysis or some forms of oxidation. (Reprinted by permission from

the hearts by pathologists blinded to the genotyping revealed 
TTR amyloid deposition in the four independently identified 
TTR V122I carriers, suggesting that TTR V122I had an abso￾lute anatomic risk for cardiac amyloidosis after age 65.
Retrospective
Retrospective series of patients with TTR V122I cardiac amyloi￾dosis have been reported by amyloid referral centers (Table 2). 
Most of the patients had severe congestive heart failure at the 
time of presentation and, hence, were late in the course of their 
disease. A comparison of African Americans with documented 
cardiac amyloidosis due to amyloid derived from immuno￾globulin light chain (AL) with those whose deposits consisted 
of V122I TTR fibrils by the Amyloid Treatment and Research 
Program at Boston University revealed later onset in the TTR 
patients (70 vs. 57 years) with greater male preponderance (78 
vs. 58%29). In their population (i.e., African Americans referred 
to an established amyloid treatment center with a diagnosis of 
cardiac amyloidosis), every individual had an equal chance of 
having AL or ATTR V122I deposition despite the higher fre￾quency of AL in African Americans. Carpal tunnel involve￾ment was more frequent in the ATTR group, whereas the AL 
subjects showed more renal and peripheral nerve deposition. 
Five of the 32 TTR V122I carriers were homozygous.
A retrospective analysis of 25 patients, all with some degree 
of cardiac failure and found to carry the TTR V122I encoding 
allele, referred to the National Amyloidosis Centre at the Royal 
Free Hospital in London for evaluation of cardiac amyloidosis 
found a spectrum of ethnic origins, including one Caucasian, 
several Nigerians, and a majority of subjects described as

Afro-Caribbean, which is consistent with prior data regard￾ing the association of African heritage with the allele.30 Three 
were homozygous for the amyloidogenic allele and had a sig￾nificantly lower mean age of onset than the heterozygous car￾riers (61 vs. 70 years). Again, the presence of congestive failure 
indicated advanced disease at the time of referral.
Prospective studies
A small, prospective, multicenter collaborative study 
(Transthyretin Amyloidosis Cardiac Study) of subjects with 
confirmed TTR cardiac amyloidosis recruited 11 patients with 
TTR V122I and 18 patients with wild-type TTR deposition.31
The V122I patients were younger, although not significantly so 
(P = 0.06). All had significant congestive heart failure. Those 
with V122I had much higher mortality rates than the wild-type 
subjects for the duration of the study. Because of their mode of 
ascertainment, as in the Boston and London series, it is likely 
that they were late in the course of their disease at the time 
of entry into the study (i.e., with diminished systolic ejection 
fractions).
In a unique study using a prospective case–control design, 25 
TTR V122I carriers were identified by genotyping consenting 
African-American subjects older than age 60 who were referred 
for echocardiography (21/25) or were in the general population 
of a Department of Veterans Affairs Hospital (4/25).32 Each 
allele carrier was matched for age, gender, ethnicity, and blood 
pressure level with two homozygous wild-type TTR individuals. 
Although those referred for cardiac ultrasound were being 
investigated for either congestive heart failure or hypertensive 
heart disease, none had a clinical diagnosis of cardiac amyloi￾dosis. The frequency of the allele was greater, but not statisti￾cally significantly so, in subjects referred for cardiac evaluation 
than in the general hospital population (5.5 vs. 4.5%).
When studied with echocardiography and electrocardiog￾raphy, the allele carriers differed significantly from the TTR 
wild-type individuals in resting heart rate, frequency of con￾duction abnormalities, and the presence of Q waves; they fre￾quently showed a pseudo-infarction pattern. Echocardiography 
revealed differences in the mean thickness of the interventric￾ular septal and posterior ventricular walls, frequency of right 
ventricular hypertrophy, mitral deceleration time, and occur￾rence of granular sparkling.33 The two groups did not differ 
regarding estimated left ventricular mass, ejection fraction, or 
left atrial diameter.
The ultrasound data were quite different from those pre￾sented in the retrospective studies of allele carriers in which all 
the subjects came to the attention of amyloid referral centers 
with known cardiac amyloidosis and congestive heart failure. 
In the latter group, the septal- and ventricular-wall dimensions 
were much greater. The left atrial cavity was more dilated and 
right ventricular hypertrophy was more common. In addi￾tion, the mean ejection fraction was well below 50% (Table 2). 
These observations suggest that ascertainment by genotyping 
is a high-yield and useful procedure identifying patients at 
Figure 3 Multimodal imaging diagnosis of TTR V122I. (a) Standard echocardiogram shows increased wall thickness (distance between each fiduciary dot 
is 10mm, the upper limit of normal). (b) Echocardiographic longitudinal systolic strain illustrates the characteristic reduced basal strain. (c) Nuclear imaging

risk before they are severely ill and possibly more likely to be 
responsive to specific therapy if and when treatments become 
available. The study also indicated that 75% of the allele carriers 
had anatomic (by echocardiogram) evidence of cardiac amy￾loidosis and that congestive heart failure (primarily diastolic) 
and/or atrial fibrillation were twice as common as in the age-, 
gender-, and ethnically matched allele-negative subjects. These 
observations support the notion that the amyloidogenic allele is 
clinically highly penetrant in elderly allele carriers referred for 
cardiac evaluation.32
The argument for aggressive genotyping is also supported 
by an analysis of the frequency of TTR V122I carriers in the 
Beta-Blocker Evaluation Survival Trial (BEST), which included 
5,500 individuals (670 African Americans) above age 35 with 
New York Heart Association grade III or IV congestive heart 
failure.34 DNA was available from 1,000 participants, includ￾ing 207 African Americans. A diagnosis of cardiac amyloidosis 
excluded patients from the study. Nonetheless, in subjects older 
than 60, 10% of the congestive heart failure patients carried the 
amyloidogenic allele (compared with 2.12% of a community￾based sample of African Americans older than age 65). The 
difference was highly significant, particularly because African￾American subjects older than 60 were underrepresented in the 
DNA cohort compared to the entire study group. These data 
suggest that allele carriers with significant cardiac amyloidosis 
are overrepresented among elderly African Americans with 
severe congestive heart failure. The data also indicate that the 
diagnosis is not easily made even by cardiac physicians respon￾sible for enrolling patients in a therapeutic trial. Among the 
BEST African-American subjects younger than 60 years with 
severe heart failure, the frequency of TTR V122I was 3.5%, 
which is not different from that of the African-American popu￾lation at large and is consistent with the age dependence of the 
clinical phenotype.
A recent study from five cardiology clinics in France revealed 
that, of 300 consecutive patients with a diagnosis of hypertrophic 
cardiomyopathy who underwent exomic sequencing of their 
TTR genes, 15% had a pathogenic TTR variant. Surprisingly, 
the most common mutation was TTR V122I.21 The ethnic ori￾gin of the V122I-positive subjects is under investigation.
Outcomes
Because TTR V122I cardiac amyloidosis appears to be age￾dependent, the prevalence of the allele in an “at-risk” popula￾tion should reflect the mortality effect (if any) of the condition. 
To address this question, the allele frequency was determined 
in DNA samples from two populations selected to demographi￾cally represent the African-American community at large, one 
older than 65 (Cardiovascular Health Study; CHS) and one 
younger than 65 (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities; ARIC). 
If the TTR V122I allele behaves as a disease-causing or disease￾associated gene with age-dependent penetrance, then the fre￾quency of the allele in the younger population should be similar 
or identical to that found in population studies and should be 
lower in the older cohort, reflecting an impact of the allele on 
mortality. The allele frequencies differed considerably between 
the two populations (ARIC 0.016 vs. CHS 0.011). Kaplan-Meier 
plots of the two populations showed a statistically significant 
impact on mortality in the older male subjects. In CHS females 
no effect was seen, suggesting a strong protective effect of 
gender, the mechanism of which is unknown. Higher relative 
risks were observed in allele carriers of congestive heart fail￾ure, particularly after age 70; higher risk of death was observed 
for 9 years after inception of CHS, after which the cumulative 
frequency of death in the amyloidogenic and wild-type allele 
carriers approached equity. Further, the differences in median 
values for some echocardiographic features of cardiac amy￾loidosis in allele carriers compared with nonallele carriers 
approached statistical significance, despite a very small number 
of TTR V122I allele carriers in the sample. This is particularly 
striking when one compares the same parameters in allele and 
nonallele carriers in the larger ARIC cohort comprising those 
younger than 65, in which no differences were detectable in any 
of the relevant parameters, again suggesting that TTR V122I 
disease is autosomal dominant with age-dependent penetrance.
A follow-up analysis of TTR V122I allele carriers in the 
ARIC population indicated that clinical penetrance of the allele 
may be lower than estimated in the case–control study.35 The 
authors proposed that the high frequency of congestive failure 
and arrhythmia reported earlier may have reflected a degree of 
ascertainment bias because the allele carriers were identified 
among male patients undergoing cardiac ultrasonography for 
suspected heart disease. In the more recent study, congestive 
heart failure and findings consistent with cardiac amyloidosis 
were increased in the carrier males. However, differences in 
overall mortality were not statistically significant. Age and gen￾der, previously found to be significant covariates of penetrance, 
could not be documented to play a role, perhaps because in the 
surviving population and those available for evaluation females 
were highly overrepresented. The data sets remain to be fully 
reconciled.
Open questions
The reported autopsy study showed that after age 65, all TTR 
V122I carriers had some degree of cardiac amyloid deposi￾tion. The extent of clinical penetrance is less certain. Studies 
of penetrance of other TTR mutations suggest that gene–gene 
or gene–environment interactions play a role in age of onset of 
clinical disease.36
The case–control analysis indicated that echocardiographic 
evidence of amyloid deposition was present in three-quarters of 
the allele carriers at the time of analysis (mean age, 73). At the 
same time, congestive heart failure, as manifested by diastolic 
dysfunction or arrhythmia, was present in approximately half 
of those showing echocardiographic abnormalities. It is unclear 
whether the 20–25% of TTR V122I–positive subjects older 
than 70 who had no abnormalities will ever show any evidence 
of disease or whether their age of onset will be later.
TTR V122I patients are underrepresented or absent from 
many reports describing large numbers of patients with

Review BUXBAUM and RUBERG | Cardiac amyloidosis in elderly African Americans
hereditary cardiac amyloidoses, even from centers evaluating 
subjects with disease related to TTR mutations. One reason is 
geographic. Many of the TTR mutations occur in a single fam￾ily member or a small number of relatives; they are generally 
recognized by the presence of polyneuropathy, a more blatant 
clinical presentation than early cardiomyopathy, and occur 
in confined geographic foci. The most common polyneuro￾pathic mutation (TTRV30M) was described independently in 
three locations where there was little African representation: 
Portugal, Japan, and northern Sweden.4,37,38 Over time, it became 
clear that many of these subjects also had cardiomyopathy. The 
first mutations with predominant cardiac clinical phenotypes 
Met111 and Ala60 were also described in kindreds of northern 
European origin (Denmark and Ireland).39,40 Similarly, recent 
comprehensive studies of a large number of Italian TTR muta￾tion carriers have provided much insight into disease patho￾genesis but involved few subjects of African origin.
The second factor resulting in a lack of representation of 
TTR V122I carriers in a large series, particularly in the United 
States, was socioeconomic in that amyloid referral centers 
that had accumulated a sufficient number of cardiomyopathy 
patients to report did not serve patient populations likely to 
have significant numbers of subjects of West African descent. 
As physicians in centers with larger, more economically diverse 
patient populations have become aware of the disease, larger 
numbers of affected TTR V122I carriers have been identified 
and included in more recent clinical analyses (Table 2).29,30
Diagnosis
The first principle of diagnosis of TTR V122I cardiac amyloi￾dosis or any amyloidosis is to consider the possibility. Without 
thinking of the diagnosis, it is unlikely that the definitive test (i.e., 
subcutaneous fat aspiration or endomyocardial biopsy) will be 
performed.41,42 The manifestations of the disease(s) reflect the 
patient’s physiologic status and may be indistinguishable from 
those with cardiomyopathy of any cause, including cases of 
hypertensive, hypertrophic, or coronary artery disease in which 
diastolic dysfunction appears early. Hence, understanding the 
epidemiology and the clinical history is critical in forming one’s 
initial set of diagnostic possibilities. The case–control study 
cited above suggests that when presented with a male individual 
over age 60 of known African descent with symptoms and signs 
of diastolic dysfunction confirmed by echocardiography, the 
possibility of TTR V122I cardiac amyloidosis should be consid￾ered, particularly in the presence of interventricular septal and 
left ventricular posterior-wall thickening. These findings are of 
moderate sensitivity (57%) but good specificity (90%, Figure 3a). 
In that same study, neither the presence of hypertension nor 
the absence of low voltage on the electrocardiogram elimi￾nated a diagnosis of cardiac amyloid deposition. Many affected 
patients have cardiac-wall thickening that is incorrectly attrib￾uted to hypertensive disease. A low-voltage ECG in the setting 
of increased ventricular-wall thickness is reasonably specific for 
amyloid; however, it is not highly sensitive and is even less so in 
TTR than in AL cardiac deposition.23,43,44
In recent years, studies have reported Doppler longitudinal 
systolic strain measurements and cardiac magnetic resonance 
findings that appear to be characteristic of cardiac amyloi￾dosis and that the nuclear bone-avid tracers Tc99DPD or PYP 
can distinguish between AL and TTR cardiac deposition45–48
(Figure  3b,c). The findings from the case–control study cited 
above, which preceded the availability of these more current 
techniques, suggest that in that particular clinical setting, geno￾typing for the TTR V122I allele may be equally informative. 
Once the diagnosis of cardiac amyloidosis is established, the 
nature of the precursor can be ascertained by either subcutane￾ous fat aspiration or endomyocardial biopsy with mass spec￾trometry of the sample or staining of the tissue with Congo red 
and antibodies specific for individual precursors (i.e., anti-TTR, 
anti-κ, or anti-λ) that are most likely to be responsible in this age 
group.49 Because immunohistochemistry expertise varies greatly 
across institutions, mass spectrometry has been suggested as a 
more reliable standard. It is important to note that subcutaneous 
fat aspirate identifies amyloid deposition by Congo red stain￾ing in approximately 70% of cases; therefore, a negative aspirate 
does not preclude the diagnosis of ATTR V122I.40 Involvement 
of other organ systems can also suggest amyloid type because 
AL is more likely to be associated with renal disease and periph￾eral neuropathy than cardiac TTR amyloid deposition.29
It appears that in elderly men, TTR V122I deposition pre￾cedes wild-type TTR deposition by approximately a decade.28
Many studies have indicated the characteristic echocardio￾graphic findings associated with restrictive cardiomyopathy 
and diastolic dysfunction in cardiac amyloidosis.50 The argu￾ment regarding the relevance of late-stage diagnosis in amy￾loid referral centers is clear from the data shown in Table 2. 
Comparison of the conventional echocardiographic and elec￾trocardiographic features of cardiac amyloidosis in TTR 
V122I carriers identified by preemptive genotyping of African 
Americans older than age 60 referred for echocardiography in a 
general hospital with those reported from amyloid referral cen￾ters revealed lesser amounts of amyloid deposition and diastolic 
dysfunction and no evidence of left ventricular dysfunction in 
the patients first identified as TTR V122I carriers. Hence, the 
diagnosis of early disease should come to mind using age and 
African origin, with evidence of diastolic dysfunction and sep￾tal thickening as filters for genotyping in this clinical setting. 
Although the population yield may be small (5–10%), the clini￾cal impact on the individual allele carriers and their families 
will be high, particularly as effective therapies become available.
There is now sufficient experience with cardiac magnetic 
resonance imaging to be able to readily detect amyloid depo￾sition and measure progression using a combination of late 
gadolinium enhancement (Figure 3d) and parametric quanti￾fication of T1 and T2 relaxation times.46,51,52 These studies have 
suggested that sensitivity and specificity of cardiac magnetic

in Europe53 or with 99mTc-PYP (pyrophosphate) in the United 
States.54 Although minimal uptake is seen in cardiac AL depo￾sition, greater uptake is seen in TTR; hence, the magnitude of 
cardiac tracer uptake relative to bone as one suggested standard, 
or the contralateral chest as another standard, can be diagnos￾tic. 99mTc-DPD or 99mTc-PYP scans are on the verge of wide￾spread clinical adaptation owing to their ease of performance 
and interpretation, low cost, and high sensitivity and specificity 
for ATTR as compared to AL and other nonamyloid cardio￾myopathies. A large, international, multicenter experience with 
99mTc-DPD, 99mTc-PYP, and 99mTc-HMDP suggests that ATTR 
can be reliably and accurately differentiated from AL and other 
wall-thickening processes, perhaps bypassing the requirement 
for a positive tissue biopsy result. The second US-based mul￾ticenter experience with 99mTc-PYP reported excellent cross￾center test validity and prognostic value ascribed to a positive 
test result (heart-to-contralateral chest ratio >1.6).55 With a 
positive scan, subsequent genetic testing showing V122I would 
therefore confer diagnosis. For these reasons, these scans hold 
great promise for increasing ATTR recognition without having 
to resort to endomyocardial biopsy.
Therapy
For many years, the diagnosis of cardiac amyloidosis of any eti￾ology was neglected on two grounds. First, it was thought to be 
largely without functional import. Second, even if the diagno￾sis could be established, there were no options for therapy; the 
main therapeutic consideration was avoidance of compounds 
reported to have toxic effects in such patients, notably digoxin￾related glycosides and calcium channel blockers, both of which 
had been reported to bind to amyloid fibrils.56–58 With the addi￾tional realization that stroke volume was relatively fixed in such 
patients, the use of agents such as high-dose β-blockers, which 
restricted cardiac rate and thereby compromised the response 
to increased demand, as well as high-dose ACE (angiotensin￾converting enzyme) inhibitors have been avoided. Therefore, 
evidence-based interventions for other causes of heart failure 
are not helpful and can even be harmful in TTR V122I. The 
mainstay of therapy for all forms of cardiac amyloidosis has 
been diuretics. The adaptation of chemotherapeutic protocols 
effective in multiple myeloma for the treatment of AL has been 
reasonably successful. Thus, distinguishing between cardiac AL 
and TTR diseases has become essential for appropriate patient 
management.58
Since the early 1990s, liver transplantation has been the only 
therapy available for patients with TTR mutations. The proce￾dure provided a crude form of gene therapy in which the source 
of the mutant protein was replaced by a liver producing only 
wild-type protein. More than 2,000 liver transplantations have 
been performed in patients carrying a variety of TTR mutations, 
predominantly TTR V30M.59 Once experience defined criteria 
for patient selection and the particulars of pre- and periopera￾tive management, the procedure resulted in arrest of disease 
progression in approximately 60% of patients with prolonged 
survival relative to nontransplanted gene carriers. There is early 
improvement, stabilization in approximately 20%, and progres￾sion, usually cardiac, in 20%. In terms of 10-year survival, TTR 
V30M subjects do better than carriers of other mutations; sub￾jects with early-onset disease have better survival than those 
who present later in life. Because of their advanced age at the 
time of diagnosis, no patients with TTR V122I have received 
liver transplants. There are two reports of cardiac transplanta￾tion with apparently good success, but the follow-up periods 
in these cases have been short.60 Several patients with cardiac 
involvement with other mutations have undergone combined 
liver and heart transplantation.61
There has been an intense effort to develop other modes of 
therapy for the TTR amyloidoses because an increasing num￾ber of TTR V30M carriers are becoming symptomatic late in 
life (and are thus not optimal candidates for liver transplanta￾tion); the largest number of potential patients with cardiac TTR 
deposition are the TTR V122I carriers and elderly subjects 
who develop wild-type TTR deposition in their 70s and 80s. 
Although the acceptable age for liver transplantation has been 
gradually increasing, according to current criteria (age younger 
than 70) few of these patients would be candidates. In addition, 
the limited availability of suitable livers is a chronic problem; 
the late complication of continuing cardiac deposition of wild￾type TTR after liver transplantation compromises the success 
of the procedure.62
The most fruitful therapeutic approach to date was based 
on the observation that occupation of the T4 binding site of 
the TTR molecule kinetically stabilized the native tetramer, 
preventing its dissociation and thus inhibiting fibril forma￾tion (Figure 1).63 Several compounds were found to be effec￾tive in vitro. Tafamidis is a compound that has been approved 
by the European Medicines Agency for use in patients with 
early-onset FAP after a clinical trial in which the compound 
arrested progression of neuropathy at a rate similar to that seen 
in patients with liver transplants.64 No cardiac efficacy results 
were reported from that study.65 Current trials are assessing its 
effect in subjects with cardiac disease.
A recently completed 12-month open-label trial of tafami￾dis involving 21 subjects with a variety of mutations suggested 
stabilization of cardiac function in some patients during the 
period of the trial; however, the results are subject to the limita￾tions of such trials, such as the small number of subjects, rela￾tively short duration, and the open-label design.66 It remains 
to be seen whether cardiac TTR deposition can be arrested or 
reversed by this approach.
Diflunisal, a nonsteroidal, anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), 
also has a structure that allows it to fit in the T4 binding pocket 
and inhibit TTR dissociation and misfolding. Like any NSAID, 
it has inherent side effects of decreased renal function, volume 
retention, and gastrointestinal irritation, potentially limiting 
its utility in patients with advanced heart failure. Nonetheless, 
a controlled clinical trial in which FAP patients with a variety 
of mutations were treated with the drug has shown efficacy in 
arresting progression of peripheral neuropathy.67 Limited car￾diac data have been reported.

Review BUXBAUM and RUBERG | Cardiac amyloidosis in elderly African Americans
Alternative therapies not dependent on TTR stabilization 
attempt to suppress TTR production by liver cells. One method 
utilizes parenteral administration of TTR-specific small inter￾fering RNAs shown to be effective in decreasing serum TTR 
concentrations in TTR transgenic mice.68 These agents—pati￾siran and revusiran—also lower serum TTR levels in human 
mutation carriers. The early results of the patisiran trial suggest 
stabilization of the polyneuropathy, but the data regarding the 
effects on TTR cardiomyopathy caused by any precursor are too 
preliminary to evaluate. The revusiran trial has recently been 
discontinued because of an unfavorable risk-to-benefit ratio.
A parallel approach using antisense TTR RNA administered 
parenterally has been shown to suppress TTR expression in 
mice transgenic for TTR I84S as well as to lower serum TTR 
levels in subjects with TTR mutations.69 A phase III clinical trial 
is in progress.70
Based on animal and in vitro experiments, the antibiotic dox￾ycycline and the catechin, epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), a 
polyphenol component of green tea, appear to be able to cause 
dissociation of amyloid fibrils. A single, small, uncontrolled 
1-year study of EGCG either in capsule form or as a large vol￾ume of green tea in a heterogeneous group of 19 subjects with 
TTR cardiac deposition showed slight improvement in cardiac 
function as determined by echocardiography and some star￾tling anecdotal results. Further animal experiments and phase 
II clinical studies are in progress.71
Preliminary studies in TTR transgenic mice suggested that 
doxycycline and tauroursodeoxycholic acid might be effective 
mobilizers of TTR deposits. Twenty patients with various forms 
of TTR neuropathy and cardiomyopathy were treated with oral 
doxycycline (100mg b.i.d.) and tauroursodeoxycholic acid 
(250mg t.i.d.) for 1 year. Although the results were reported 
before the completion of the full course of treatment, the regi￾men appeared to be well tolerated, with only two dropouts due 
to adverse effects. The patients appeared to be stable through 
the course of the study, but the published data are too limited to 
determine whether there was any benefit.72
Additional approaches using antibodies that specifically bind 
to TTR fibrils or other components of tissue amyloid depos￾its, notably serum amyloid P-component (SAP), which are 
designed to induce a host inflammatory reaction potentially 
capable of dissolving the amyloid fibrils, are entering clinical 
trials.73,74 Whether they will achieve resolution of preexisting 
deposits and restore normal tissue function remains to be seen.
Successful development of pharmacologic therapy for V122I 
ATTR, whether tetramer stabilization, suppression of precursor 
synthesis, or dissolution of extant deposits, is critical given that 
the advanced age of affected patients precludes liver transplan￾tation. The success of any or all of these approaches may also 
permit potential antiamyloid prophylaxis in at-risk individuals 
who carry an amyloidogenic TTR mutation as primary ther￾apy and perhaps eliminate the need for liver transplantation. 
The fact that each treatment, if successful, works by a different 
mechanism offers the possibility of combined therapies. With 
their availability, the responsibility for making the diagnosis 
of this disorder early enough to impact outcome rests with the 
first physician to see the patient, typically a cardiologist. The 
diagnostic tools are now available. We just have to use them 
appropriately.
