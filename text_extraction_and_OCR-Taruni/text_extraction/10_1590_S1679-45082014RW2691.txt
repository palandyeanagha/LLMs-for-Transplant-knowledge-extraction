ABSTRACT
Obesity is a chronic disease characterized by the excessive accumulation 
of body fat that is harmful to the individuals. Respiratory disorders 
are among the comorbidities associated with obesity. This study had 
the objective of investigating the alterations in respiratory function 
that affect obese individuals. A systematic review was performed, by 
selecting publications in the science databases MEDLINE and LILACS, 
using PubMed and SciELO. The articles that assessed pulmonary 
function by plethysmography and/or spirometry in obese individuals 
aged under 18 years were included. The results demonstrated that 
the obese individuals presented with a reduction in lung volume and 
capacity as compared to healthy individuals. Reduction of total lung 
capacity and reduction of forced vital capacity, accompanied by 
reduction of the forced expiratory volume after one second were the 
most representative findings in the samples. The articles analyzed 
proved the presence of a restrictive respiratory pattern associated 
with obesity.

RESUMO
A obesidade é uma doença crônica, caracterizada pelo acúmulo 
excessivo de gordura corporal, que ocasiona prejuízos ao indivíduo. 
Dentre as comorbidades associadas à obesidade, estão as disfunções 
respiratórias. O presente estudo teve por objetivo investigar as 
alterações da função pulmonar que acometem indivíduos obesos. 
Foi realizada uma revisão sistemática, por meio da seleção de 
publicações nas bases científicas de dados MEDLINE e LILACS, por 
meio do PubMed e SciELO. Foram inclusos os trabalhos que avaliaram 
a função pulmonar, por meio de pletismografia e/ou espirometria, em 
indivíduos obesos maiores de 18 anos. Os resultados demonstraram 
que os indivíduos obesos apresentaram redução dos volumes e 
capacidades pulmonares quando comparados a indivíduos eutróficos. 
Redução da capacidade pulmonar total e redução da capacidade vital 
forçada, acompanhadas de redução do volume expiratório forçado 
após um segundo, foram os achados mais representativos dentre as 
amostras. Os trabalhos analisados comprovam a presença de padrão 
respiratório restritivo associado à obesidade.

INTRODUCTION
Obesity is a chronic disease characterized by excessive 
accumulation of body fat that is harmful to individuals.(1) 
According to the World Health Organization,(2) obesity 
has reached epidemic proportions, affecting people of 
all ages and social classes in the world. The number of 
obese individuals has doubled since 1980, and in 2008, 
more than 1.4 billion adults were obese.(2)
Overweight promotes metabolic and structural changes 
that make the obese individual more susceptible to several 
events, including cardiovascular, pulmonary renal and 
biliary diseases, metabolic alterations, obstructive sleep 
apnea and some types of neoplasms.(1,3,4)
Over the last years, the repercussions of adiposity on 
respiratory function have been studied; however, there 
is no consensus as to the physiological mechanisms that 
lead to respiratory complications.(5) It is known that 
adequate pulmonary function depends on the harmonic 
operation of the structures that compose the respiratory 
system. In obese individuals, structural changes of the 
thoracic-abdominal region lead to limited diaphragm 
mobility and rib movement, both essential for appropriate 
ventilatory mechanics. Additionally, the adipose tissue 
is an endocrine and paracrine organ that produces a 
large number of cytokines and bioactive mediators, 
thus generating in obese individuals, a pro-inflammatory

state which is associated with hypodevelopment of the 
lungs, atopy, bronchial responsiveness, increased risk of 
asthma, and phenotypic modifications for this disease.(6)
One must point out that excess body fat is classified 
in categories according to its severity (mild, moderate, 
or severe) or the type of distribution of this fat (gynoid 
or android). In this way, there are several phenotypes of 
obesity.(4) The studies published so far investigated the 
lung function of individuals with different degrees of 
obesity and assessed lung volumes and capacities in an 
individual manner. Therefore, a review is needed that 
pools all the results of these studies in a critical way, 
in order to identify which variables that evaluate lung 
function are impaired in obese individuals. From there, 
it should be possible to direct the appropriate care for 
the this population. 
Within this context, the present study was developed 
by means of a systematic review of literature, with 
the objective of investigating changes in pulmonary 
capacities and volumes associated with obesity.
METHODS
Identification of the studies
To identify the articles available in the literature on 
the theme under study, the MEDLINE and LILACS 
databases were used and accessed through PubMed 
(http://www.pubmed.gov) and SciELO (http://www.
scielo.br).
The following keywords were used in the search: 
in English, “obesity and lungfunction”, “obese and 
lung function”, and, in Portuguese, “obesidade e função 
pulmonar”. “Lung function” is not a keyword indexed 
in Mesh or Decs, but given the importance of this 
term for the search, it was adopted as a keyword. 
The investigation was limited to the presence of the 
keywords in the title and/or abstracts of the articles. 
Selection of the studies
The studies that evaluated lung function of obese 
or overweight individuals by means of spirometry or 
plethysmography tests were selected. Obese individuals 
were considered as those with a body mass index 
(BMI) >30kg/m² and overweight people as those with 
BMI ≥25kg/m².(7) As variables for the lung function 
evaluations, we searched for lung volumes and 
capacities: total lung capacity (TLC), vital capacity 
(VC), forced vital capacity (FVC), residual functional 
capacity (RFC), forced expiratory volume after 1 second 
(FEV1
), inspiratory reserve volume (IRV), tidal volume 
(TV), expiratory reserve volume (ERV), and residual 
volume (RV).
After identification of the keywords in the title and/
or abstract, the selected articles went through reading of 
the abstracts to evaluate how appropriate the methods 
and study populations were as to the proposal of this 
review. Those tests that satisfied the predetermined 
eligibility criteria were acquired in their entirety for 
detailed analysis and data extraction.
The articles describing studies in children, which did 
not use spirometry or plethysmography to evaluate lung 
volumes, or that evaluated lung function of individuals 
with chronic lung disease, and review articles were 
excluded. 
Data extraction
The search and analysis of articles, as per the strategy 
mentioned above, were conducted independently by two 
evaluators (Author 1 and Author 2). Controversies as to 
eligibility of the publications to compose the database 
were resolved by consensus.
There was no blinding as to names of the authors, 
journals, or organizations. This is a possible source 
of bias, even if involuntary. On the other hand, as a 
strategy to minimize biases, each author involved in the 
selection of articles only acknowledged articles selected 
by the other author at the time of consensus for choosing 
appropriate studies for data extraction. Additionally, 
since the search was limited to the keywords chosen, 
it is possible that other studies on the theme were not 
taken into consideration.
Data tabulation 
The texts selected were read in detail to compile data 
corresponding to pulmonary function and overweight. 
Data relative to characterization of the samples, 
variables studied, and results obtained in the studies 
were organized in a Microsoft Office Excel 2007 
spreadsheet. From that, it was possible to analyze 
the changes in values obtained by spirometry and/or 
plethysmography in obese individuals. 
RESULTS
Eighty-seven studies were found using the keywords 
“obese and lung function”; 144 with the keywords 
“obesity and lung function”; no studies were found in 
Portuguese with these keywords. According to the pre￾established criteria, nine studies were selected (Charts 
1and 2).

countries, and one in Turkey. All studies had samples 
composed by both genders, with a predominance of 
females. As to the lung function evaluation, two articles 
used plethysmography,(9,10) six used spirometry,(8,11-15) and 
one used both tests.(16)
Decreased FEV1
, associated with overweight, was 
found in 6 studies.(8,9,11,14-16) Carey et al. identified that 
a 10kg weight gain induced a drop in FEV1 by 96mL 
in men and by 51mL in women.(8) Thyagarajan et al. 
observed that individuals with a BMI ≥26.4kg/m² had a 
reduction of 64mL in FEV1 in 10 years. During the same 
period, individuals with a BMI <21.3kg/m² showed an 
increase of 60mL in the FEV1
, with no reduction up to 
38 years of age.(11) The decrease in FEV1 in this study was 
more expressive in obese individuals, who had a greater 
weight gain during the study. Corroborating these findings, 
in evaluating 136 morbid obese individuals, Saliman et 
al. found that women had a mean FEV1
 of 79% of that 
predicted, and men had 65% of the predicted value.(16)
Although the studies point towards a decrease of 
FEV1
 in men and women, Carey et al. and Steele et al. 
demonstrated that central fat deposit seems to have a 
stronger association with breathing mechanisms in men 
compared to women.(8,14)
Four studies found an inverse relation between FVC 
and obesity.(11,14-16) In one cohort studied by Thyagarajan 
et al., in 10 years, participants with BMI ≥26.4kg/m² 
presented with a decrease by 185mL in the FVC, while 
those with BMI <21.3kg/m² showed an average increment 
of 71mL. Individuals that gained more weight had a 
greater drop in FVC.(11) In the morbid obese from the 
study by Saliman et al. the mean value of was 83% of 
that predicted in women and 71% of the predicted in 
men.(16) Just as for FEV1
, Steele et al. found that the 
central fat deposit seemed to be more strongly related 
to the lung function in men than in women.(14)
As to TLC, three articles demonstrated a decreased 
association with overweight.(9,10,16) Saliman et al. found a 
mean value of TLC of 87% and 82% of that predicted 
in women and men, respectively. In the study, TLC and 
BMI showed an inversely proportional relationship.(16) 
In the study by Jones and Nzekwu, individuals with 
normal weight and overweight showed no significant 
difference as to TLC. However, individuals with normal 
weight had a significantly greater TLC when compared 
to those with mild, moderate, and morbid obesity.(10)
RFC and ERV were decreased in the samples of 
four studies.(9,10,12,13) In Jones and Nzekwu, the group 
with normal weight had significantly different values of 
RFC and ERV relative to the other groups.(10) But the 
mild, moderate, and morbid obese show no statistically 
significant differences among themselves. Still in this

study, among the variables studied, RFC and ERV had 
the most expressive values, decreasing with the increase 
of BMI. Confirming these findings, the most common 
abnormality found by Ceylan et al.(12) in the individuals 
with overweight and obesity was a reduction in RFC 
and ERV, both in men and in women.
VC also suffered influence from overweight, decreasing 
with the increase of obesity.(9,10) Just as for TLC, the 
study by Jones and Nzekwu(10) did not demonstrate a 
difference as to VC among people with normal weight 
and overweight, but between the normal weight and the 
obese, there was a significant difference. On the other 
hand, Gabrielsen et al. found no association between 
alterations of VC and BMI, but they noted that the neck 
circumference had a negative correlation with VC.(13)
Jones and Nzekwu, further found a decrease in VR 
in obese individuals when compared to normal-weight 
individuals.(10)
DISCUSSION
Breathing is an essential function for survival, and 
alterations in lung function can hinder quality of life 
and performance in activities of daily living. To maintain 
respiratory homeostasis, the structures that compose 
the respiratory system need to work in equilibrium, that 
is, the lungs should be ventilated and the gases should 
diffuse through the alveolar-capillary barrier.(17)
An efficient form to evaluate lung function is by 
determining lung volumes, which offer information essential 
for the characterization of the pathophysiological state 
resulting from abnormalities in the pulmonary-ventilatory 
processes.(18) The most accurate techniques for determining 
lung volumes are spirometry and plethysmography.(19) 
Castrejón Vázquez et al.(20) carried out a comparative 
study between the two techniques and observed that 
both provided similar results, despite the fact that 
plethysmography shows greater sensitivity. In this way, 
even if there are articles using different techniques, 
it is possible to compare them without compromising 
the results. 
The reduction of FVC happens both in restrictive 
and obstructive diseases, but the percentage of reduction 
of FEV1
 accompanies the reduction of FVC.(21) Such a 
situation was found in the studies that evaluated these 
two variables,(11,14-16) suggesting a restrictive pattern in 
the samples studied. Since the subjects evaluated did 
not have respiratory disease, the restriction could be 
explained by the alteration in ventilatory mechanics 
experienced by the obese. In normal breathing, 
the diaphragm contracts, pushing the abdominal 
content downward and forward, and at the same time, 
contraction of the external intercostal muscles tractions 
the ribs upwards and forward.(17) In obese individuals, 
this mechanism is hindered, since the excess adiposity 
that covers the thorax and the abdomen encumbers the 
breathing muscles. Such a mechanism also explains the 
findings by Steele et al.(14) that demonstrate a stronger 
relation of the FVC and FEV1 alterations in men when 
compared to women. This is because the male gender has 
a greater frequency of android fat deposit pattern, while 
gynoid fat is more common in the female gender.(22) In 
other words, a greater deposit of fat in the abdominal 
region generates a greater resistance to diaphragmatic 
contraction, hindering ventilatory mechanics. 
In individuals with no obstructive disease, FVC is 
normally equal to the VC.(21) Due to lack of data on 
these two variables in the studies selected, it was not 
possible to assess a negative relation between obesity 
and VC,(9,10) which is justified by the same physiological 
mechanisms that explain the reduction of FVC. It 
is important to point out that the anthropometric 
measurement used can interfere in the presence of an 
association between obesity and VC, as demonstrated 
by Gabrielsen et al.(13) Nevertheless, more studies are 
necessary to evaluate that aspect.
Under physiological conditions, RFC represents 
the equilibrium point of elastic retractions between the 
lungs and the chest wall.(18) Therefore, conditions that 
limit chest expansibility will invariably affect the volume 
contained in the lungs at the end of a spontaneous 
expiration (RFC). RFC is understood as the sum of VR 
and ERV. Consequently, variations of the VR or ERV 
imply alterations of RFC, as demonstrated by Zerah 
et al.,(9) Jones and Nzekwu,(10) Ceylan et al.,(12) and 
Gabrielsen et al.,(13) in which both RFC and ERV were 
diminished. Nevertheless, Barreto pointed out that 
the reduction of RFC, as in obesity and in pregnancy, 
should be considered, but in and of itself it does not 
represent a restrictive disease.(18)
Since only three studies used plethysmography to 
evaluate lung function, the assessment of TLC was 
limited to these two articles, as spirometry is not capable 
of evaluating such a parameter.(21) TLC is the volume 
contained in the lungs after a full inspiration and 
covers all the lung volumes.(18) In this way, alterations 
in the other lung volumes compromise TLC. Thus, it is 
possible that more samples had a lower TLC, but that 
this was not diagnosed due to methodological limitation. 
According to Barreto,(18) “TLC is the only lung volume 
with an absolute significance for the definition of the 
pathophysiological pattern: the presence of a restrictive 
abnormality is expressed by a TLC under the lower limit 
foreseen.”

Any interference in the chest bellows or in chest 
mobility, generating a decrease in lung volumes, can be 
considered a restrictive illness.(21) In the obese, excess 
fat in the abdominal cavity and chest limit the two 
primary inspiratory movements: diaphragm contraction 
propelling the abdominal content downwards and 
forwards, and increased chest diameter by means of rib 
movement.(17,23) The results of the studies evaluated in 
our review confirm the presence of a restrictive pattern 
in obese individuals when they demonstrated a decrease 
in lung volumes and capacities.
On the other hand, it is important to point out the 
existence of extremely obese individuals with normal 
spirometry, lung volume, and blood gas results.(16) It is 
noteworthy, therefore, that the mechanisms that lead to 
lung function disorders in obese individuals are still not 
completely clarified, and further studies are required in 
this area.
The present review was limited to identifying the 
alterations in lung function present in obese individuals, 
without identifying the degree of obesity from which 
such modifications stem. Additionally, some studies 
did not evaluate all lung volumes and capacities, and 
lung function disorders could not be identified. For the 
results indicated by this review to be confirmed, random 
clinical trials must be conducted with the objective of 
identifying the repercussions of overweight for lung 
function. 
Despite the previously mentioned limitations, the 
results highlighted by this review are a fruit of critical 
and systematic analysis of articles published in journals 
of renowned scientific quality. In this way, it furnished 
scientific subsidies for the appropriate management 
of the population investigated, besides pointing out 
the gaps that exist in literature so they can be filled by 
further studies. 
CONCLUSION
The obese individuals demonstrated reduced lung 
volumes and capacities when compared to normal-weight 
individuals. Reduction in total lung capacity and forced 
vital capacity, accompanied by reduced forced expiratory 
volume after one second were the most representative 
findings among the samples, both suggesting the presence 
of a restrictive respiratory pattern associated with obesity. 
Consequently, it is necessary to implement healthcare 
programs for this population, with the purpose of 
improving lung function and therefore improving quality 
of life of obese individuals. Although the investigations 
demonstrated the presence of lung alterations in the 
obese population, the physiological mechanisms that 
lead to such a situation are still not clear. Therefore, 
we suggest that more studies be carried out with the 
objective of clarifying them.
