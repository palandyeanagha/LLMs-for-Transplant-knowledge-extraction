Angiogenesis and vascular remodeling support fibroproliferative processes; however, no study has addressed 
the importance of angiogenesis during fibro-obliteration of the allograft airway during bronchiolitis obliter￾ans syndrome (BOS) that occurs after lung transplantation. The ELR+ CXC chemokines both mediate neutro￾phil recruitment and promote angiogenesis. Their shared endothelial cell receptor is the G-coupled protein 
receptor CXC chemokine receptor 2 (CXCR2). We found that elevated levels of multiple ELR+ CXC chemokines 
correlated with the presence of BOS. Proof-of-concept studies using a murine model of BOS not only demon￾strated an early neutrophil infiltration but also marked vascular remodeling in the tracheal allografts. In addi￾tion, tracheal allograft ELR+ CXC chemokines were persistently expressed even in the absence of significant 
neutrophil infiltration and were temporally associated with vascular remodeling during fibro-obliteration of 
the tracheal allograft. Furthermore, in neutralizing studies, treatment with anti-CXCR2 Abs inhibited early 
neutrophil infiltration and later vascular remodeling, which resulted in the attenuation of murine BOS. A 
more profound attenuation of fibro-obliteration was seen when CXCR2–/– mice received cyclosporin A. This 
supports the notion that the CXCR2/CXCR2 ligand biological axis has a bimodal function during the course 
of BOS: early, it is important for neutrophil recruitment and later, during fibro-obliteration, it is important 
for vascular remodeling independent of neutrophil recruitment.
Introduction
The frequency of the occurrence of bronchiolitis obliterans syn￾drome (BOS) is the main reason that the 5-year survival rate 
after lung transplantation is dismally low, at 42% (1, 2). The 
histopathology of BOS reflects its clinical presentation with 
obstruction and obliteration of airways that is characterized by an 
infiltration of peribronchiolar leukocytes that eventually invade 
and disrupt the submucosa, basement membrane, and airway epi￾thelium (1, 2). This is followed by fibroproliferation, granulation 
tissue formation, and the accumulation of ECM, ultimately ending 
in fibro-obliteration of the allograft airway (1, 2).
Angiogenesis is the formation of new blood vessels and is essen￾tial for the physiologic process of embryogenesis, tissue growth, 
and tumorigenesis (3–5). Angiogenesis has also been found to be 
central to the progression of various chronic inflammatory patho￾logic conditions, including diabetic retinopathy, macular degener￾ation, pulmonary fibrosis, and RA (6, 7). These diseases are charac￾terized by chronic inflammation and fibroproliferation associated 
with marked vascular remodeling. Since the fibro-obliteration pro￾cess occurring during BOS is analogous to these fibroproliferative 
diseases, we hypothesized that vascular remodeling due to aber￾rant angiogenesis during fibro-obliteration of the allograft airway 
may contribute to the pathogenesis of BOS.
The CXC chemokine subfamily can be divided into 2 groups 
according to the presence (ELR+) or absence (ELR–) of an ELR 
(Glu-Leu-Arg) motif located immediately before the first cysteine 
residue at the NH2 terminus (4). ELR+ CXC chemokines are known 
for their potent chemoattraction for neutrophils as well as their 
ability to promote angiogenesis (4). ELR+ CXC chemokines medi￾ate angiogenesis through the G protein–coupled receptor CXC 
chemokine receptor 2 (CXCR2) on endothelial cells (4). Further￾more, these ELR+ CXC chemokines have been implicated as the 
dominant mediator of aberrant angiogenesis and vascular remod￾eling in disease processes such as adult respiratory distress syn￾drome (ARDS), pulmonary fibrosis, and tumor growth (8–11).
We found that lung biopsy specimens from patients with BOS 
had increased vascular remodeling. In addition, bronchoalveolar 
lavage fluid (BALF) from patients with future BOS (FBOS) (see 
Methods), BOS, and treated BOS (TBOS) had increased angiogenic 
activity. Furthermore, this angiogenic activity was predominately 
due to elevated levels of multiple ELR+ CXC chemokines. Proof￾of-concept studies using a murine model of BOS also demon￾strated increased vascular remodeling that paralleled ELR+ CXC 
chemokine expression in tracheal allografts. Inhibition of these

CXCR2 Ab inhibited early neutrophil infiltration and late vascular 
remodeling and attenuated tracheal allograft fibro-obliteration. 
However, the effect of anti-CXCR2 Ab on the inhibition of vascular 
remodeling was independent of its effect on neutrophil recruit￾ment. Moreover, CXCR2–/– recipient mice receiving cyclosporin A 
(CsA) had more profound effects in reducing murine BOS as com￾pared to CXCR2+/+ mice receiving CsA or neutralizing CXCR2 
alone. These studies demonstrate the importance of the CXCR2/
CXCR2 ligand biologic axis during the course of BOS.
Results
Aberrant angiogenesis is associated with late allograft dysfunction (BOS). 
We first assessed whether aberrant angiogenesis was present in 
human BOS by performing immunolocalization studies of factor 
VIII–related antigen (F8Ag) on human BOS and normal lung tis￾sue specimens. We chose F8Ag since it is not expressed on alveolar 
capillary endothelium and therefore can be used to distinguish 
endothelium in areas of vascular remodeling from endothelium 
associated with collapsed alveoli. F8Ag was strongly expressed in 
areas surrounding BOS lesions (Figure 1A). Quantitative analysis 
of F8Ag-positive vessels demonstrated a marked increase in vas￾cular remodeling of the allograft airway in individuals with BOS 
compared with those in whom lung biopsies were normal (Table 
1). To determine whether angiogenic activity was present in the 
lungs of transplant recipients with BOS compared with healthy 
transplant recipients, we used the corneal micropocket (CMP) 
assay of angiogenesis. We found that there was a greater angiogenic 
response in pooled samples of human BALF normalized to total 
protein from patients with BOS (n = 8; 6 of 6 positive CMPs) than 
in samples from healthy transplant recipients (n = 8; 
that demonstrated no significant angiogenic response 
[0 of 6 positive CMPs]). Moreover, there was a greater 
angiogenic response in samples from BALF from lung 
transplant recipients with FBOS and TBOS (n = 8 and 
n = 8; 5 of 6 and 6 of 6 positive, respectively).
Elevated levels of ELR+ CXC chemokines are associated with 
human BOS. Several studies have described an associa￾tion among elevated levels of CXC chemokine ligand 8 
(CXCL8), neutrophilia, and human BOS (12–15). 
However, there are multiple ELR+ CXC chemokines 
besides CXCL8 that are not only potent neutrophil 
chemoattractants but are also critical in regulating 
angiogenesis (4, 16, 17). We examined whether there 
were any significant elevations in CXCL1, CXCL3, 
CXCL5, CXCL7, and CXCL8 in BALF in a 4-group 
comparison among lung transplant recipients with 
BOS (n = 30), FBOS (n = 28), and TBOS (n = 10) and 
healthy lung transplant recipients (n = 47). The levels 
of CXCL7 were significantly elevated in the BOS and 
FBOS groups compared with the healthy transplant 
recipients (Figure 2A). In addition, the levels of CXCL3 and 
CXCL8 were significantly elevated in the FBOS, BOS, and TBOS 
groups compared with those in the healthy transplant recipients 
(Figure 2, B and C). No significant elevations of CXCL1 or CXCL5 
were found (Figure 2, D and E). The expression of CXCL7 during 
FBOS and BOS and CXCL3 during FBOS, BOS, and TBOS dem￾onstrated that 2 other ELR+ CXC chemokines besides CXCL8 are 
involved in the pathogenesis of BOS.
BOS and FBOS BALF angiogenic activity is attributable to CXCR2/
CXCR2 ligand biology. To substantiate that the elevated levels of 
multiple ELR+ CXC chemokines found in the BALF of patients 
with BOS were modulating angiogenic activity, we assessed ran￾domly pooled samples of BALF from either recipients with BOS 
(n = 8) and healthy transplant recipients (n = 8) in the presence or 
absence of neutralizing CXCR2 or control Ab. Neutralizing Ab spe￾cific to CXCR2 was chosen, since CXCR2 has been demonstrated 
to be the receptor mediating ELR+ CXC chemokine angiogenesis,

and the 3 ligands CXCL3, CXCL7, and CXCL8 share the same 
endothelial cell receptor, CXCR2 (18). In addition, immunolocal￾ization of human BOS lung tissue specimens demonstrated that 
CXCR2 was strongly expressed on endothelium in areas surround￾ing human BOS (Figure 3, A and B). The CMP demonstrated 
that neutralization of CXCR2 with anti-CXCR2 Ab significantly 
attenuated the angiogenic activity of BALF from patients 
with BOS (1 of 6 positive) compared with control Ab (6 of 
6 positive) (Figure 3C). In addition, neutralizing Ab specific 
to CXCR2 significantly inhibited the angiogenic activity of 
BALF from recipients with FBOS and TBOS (0 of 6 and 1 
of 6 positive, respectively), as compared with control Abs (5 
of 6 and 6 of 6 positive, respectively) (Figure 3C). To con￾firm our results, we performed human lung microvascular 
endothelial cell (HLMVEC) chemotaxis in the presence of 
anti-CXCR2 or control Ab in response to BALF from recipi￾ents with FBOS, BOS, and TBOS and healthy transplant 
recipients. Marked HLMVEC chemotaxis was induced in 
the FBOS, BOS, and TBOS groups compared with healthy 
lung transplant recipients (Figure 3D). Neutralizing Ab 
specific to CXCR2 significantly reduced endothelial cell 
chemotactic activity in the FBOS, BOS, and TBOS groups 
compared with control Ab (Figure 3D). There was no sig￾nificant effect found with neutralizing CXCR2 or control 
Ab in the healthy group (Figure 3D). These findings suggest 
that the ELR+ CXC chemokines are angiogenic factors that 
mediate angiogenesis through CXCR2 during human BOS 
and are also associated with FBOS and TBOS patients.
VEGF does not significantly contribute to the angiogenic activity in BOS. 
Since VEGF has been shown to be an important angiogenic factor, 
we assessed whether it contributes to the angiogenic activity in 
BOS. The levels of VEGF in BALF from patients with FBOS, BOS, 
and TBOS and healthy transplant recipients were not statistically 
different (FBOS, 0.21 ± 0.14 ng/ml; BOS, 0.14 ± 0.10 ng/ml; TBOS,

0.04 ± 0.02 ng/ml; and healthy, 0.19 ± 0.11 ng/ml, respectively; 
P > 0.05). Furthermore VEGF angiogenic activity was evaluated 
using the CMP assay. Neutralization of VEGF did not significant￾ly attenuate the angiogenic activity of BALF from recipients with 
BOS (6 of 6 positive) as compared with control Ab (5 of 6 positive). 
To determine whether the anti-VEGF could block VEGF-mediated 
angiogenesis in the CMP, we assessed VEGF-induced angiogenesis 
in the CMP in the presence of anti-VEGF or control Ab. Anti-VEGF 
attenuated VEGF-induced angiogenesis (0 of 6 positive) compared 
with control Ab (6 of 6 positive). These findings confirmed that 
BALF-derived VEGF from either BOS or FBOS patients did not 
play a significant role in promoting angiogenic activity.
Murine BOS tissue demonstrates angiogenic activity. Our findings 
from specimens from patients with BOS after lung transplanta￾tion demonstrated the following: (a) vascular remodeling is pres￾ent in tissue specimens associated with BOS lesions; and (b) BALF 
from FBOS, BOS, and TBOS displays angiogenic activity in CMP 
and endothelial cell chemotaxis assays that was dependent on 
the CXCR2/CXCR2 ligand biological axis and not VEGF. These 
findings support the notion that CXCR2/CXCR2 ligands are criti￾cal factors in promoting angiogenic activity in human BOS. To 
ascertain whether this biology actually contributes to aberrant 
angiogenesis/vascular remodeling, we used an animal model of 
BOS as previously described (19, 20).
To determine whether aberrant angiogenesis was associated 
with murine BOS as it is with human BOS, we assessed immu￾nolocalization of F8Ag on allograft tissue at day 21, a time point 
when significant fibro-obliteration occurred. F8Ag was strongly 
expressed on endothelial cell in areas of fibro-obliteration (Fig￾ure 4A). In addition, quantitative analysis of F8Ag-positive ves￾sels demonstrated a marked increase in vascular remodeling in 
allografts as compared with syngeneic controls at days 7 and 21 
(Table 2). Furthermore, angiogenic activity was assessed from 
tracheal allografts compared with syngeneic controls. Using the 
CMP assay, we found that the angiogenic response was greater in 
pooled tracheal allograft homogenates at days 7 and 21 (n = 12 
and n = 12; 5 of 6 and 6 of 6 positive, respectively) than in tracheal 
syngeneic control homogenates at the same time points (n = 12 
and n = 12, respectively) (1 of 6 and 0 of 6 positive, respectively) 
(Figure 4B). To further substantiate that aberrant vascular remod￾eling was occurring in the allografts compared with syngeneic 
controls, we performed FACS analysis of the pan-endothelial cell 
marker MECA-32 on single-cell suspensions of tracheal digests at 
days 7 and 21. We found significantly more endothelial cells in the 
tracheal allografts compared with syngeneic controls at both time 
points (Figure 4C). These data indicate that vascular remodeling is 
a significant component of the pathogenesis of murine BOS.
ELR+ CXC chemokine levels are elevated during murine BOS. Know￾ing that the CXCR2 ligands are potent inducers of angiogenesis, 
we assessed the kinetics of murine CXCL1 and CXCL2/3 expres￾sion during murine BOS. Real-time quantitative PCR of tracheal 
homogenates demonstrated markedly greater mRNA expression

for both CXCR2 ligands from the allografts compared with the 
syngeneic controls (Figure 5, A and B). Interestingly, CXCL1 
mRNA expression was only significantly elevated at day 7 (Figure 
5A). In contrast, CXCL2/3 mRNA expression was elevated at day 
7, peaked at day 14, and remained markedly elevated through￾out the remainder of the time course compared with syngeneic 
controls (Figure 5B). Protein levels of CXCR2 ligands were deter￾mined by specific ELISAs on tracheal homogenates over the 
28-day time course. The protein levels of CXCL1 and CXCL2/3 
paralleled their mRNA expression (Figure 5, C and D). Interest￾ingly, the pattern of neutrophil influx, as assessed by FACS analy￾sis of single-cell suspensions from tracheal digests, demonstrated 
an early influx at days 3 and 7 in both allografts and syngeneic 
controls (Figure 5E). However after day 7, the number of infil￾trating neutrophils was similar in allografts and syngeneic con￾trols (Figure 5E). In contrast, the allografts continued to express 
markedly elevated levels of CXCL2/3 at days 14–28 in the absence 
of significant neutrophil infiltration in the allograft (Figure 5).
CXCR2 expression in the tracheal allograft parallels the production of 
CXCR2 ligands during murine BOS. CXCR2 is the shared receptor 
for all of the ELR+ CXC chemokines. Real-time quantitative PCR 
of tracheal homogenates demonstrated a significant increase in 
CXCR2 mRNA expression in allografts compared with syngeneic 
controls (Figure 6A). CXCR2 expression peaked at day 14 and 
remained persistently elevated throughout the remainder of the 
time course, paralleling the expression CXCL2/3 to a greater 
extent than that of CXCL1 (Figure 5 and 6A). Interestingly, at 
days 14–28, when allograft neutrophil infiltration was minimal, 
there was a persistent and significant eleva￾tion of CXCR2 mRNA expression. Knowing 
that endothelial cells can express CXCR2, 
we performed dual-color FACS analysis on 
single-cell suspensions of whole tracheal 
digests for the cell surface expression of 
CXCR2 protein on endothelial cells that were 
positive for MECA-32. We found a significant 
increase in cell surface expression of CXCR2 
on endothelial cells from allografts at days 
7 and 21 (Figure 6B). Immunolocalization 
studies of CXCR2 on the allografts at day 21 
confirmed these results. CXCR2 was strongly 
expressed on the vasculature in areas of fibro￾obliteration of the airway (Figure 6C). This is 
consistent with the hypothesis that CXCR2/
CXCR2 ligand biological function promotes 
a proangiogenic microenvironment during 
the course of BOS.
Angiogenic activity is attributable to CXCR2/CXCR2 ligand biology in 
murine BOS. To substantiate that the CXCR2 ligands are modu￾lating tracheal allograft-derived angiogenic activity, we random￾ly pooled tracheal allografts at days 7 and 21 (n = 12 and n = 12, 
respectively) in the presence or absence of specific neutralizing 
CXCR2 or control Ab and assessed their angiogenic activity in 
the CMP. Neutralizing Ab specific to CXCR2 significantly attenu￾ated the angiogenic activity of allografts at days 7 and 21 (0 of 6 
and 1 of 6 positive, respectively) compared with control Ab (6 of 
6 and 5 of 6 positive, respectively) (Figure 7A). To further analyze 
CXCR2/CXCR2 ligand angiogenic activity during murine BOS, we 
performed in vivo neutralization of CXCR2 in recipients of tra￾cheal allografts. Mice received specific anti-CXCR2 or control Ab 
at days 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 15. We chose to initiate therapy at day 
3 because it takes 3 days for the allograft to become vascularized 
after implantation (19, 20). The angiogenic activity of randomly 
pooled tracheal allografts harvested from animals treated with 
anti-CXCR2 Ab or control Ab at days 7 and 21 (n = 12 and n = 12, 
respectively) was assessed in the CMP. Tracheal allografts from ani￾mals that received in vivo neutralizing Ab specific to CXCR2 had 
significantly less angiogenic activity at days 7 and 21 (0 of 6 and 
1 of 6 positive, respectively) compared with those from animals 
that received in vivo control Ab at days 7 and 21 (6 of 6 and 5 of 6 
positive, respectively). We further confirmed this data using FACS 
analysis for endothelial cells on single-cell suspensions of tracheal 
digests at days 7 and 21. There were significantly fewer endothelial 
cells found in the allografts from the anti-CXCR2– compared with 
the control Ab–treated group (Figure 7B). These data demonstrate

that inhibiting CXCR2/CXCR2 ligand biology has an effect on 
reducing vascular remodeling during the course of murine BOS.
To determine whether VEGF was contributing to the aberrant 
angiogenic activity seen in BOS, we measured VEGF protein levels 
by ELISA during the course of murine BOS. VEGF levels were sig￾nificantly elevated in the allografts at day 3 (i.e., during ischemia/
reperfusion injury) compared with syngeneic controls (2.4 ± 0.2 
vs. 1.5 ± 0.2 ng/ml, respectively; P < 0.05). In addition, there was 
a trend toward elevated levels of VEGF in allografts at day 7 com￾pared with syngeneic controls (3.3 ± 1.1 vs. 1.6 ± 0.6 ng/ml, respec￾tively; P > 0.05). In contrast, after day 7, VEGF levels were found to 
markedly decline to levels comparable to those of syngeneic con￾trols (data not shown). Moreover, we assessed VEGF’s ability to 
modulate tracheal allograft-derived angiogenic activity using the 
CMP assay. Twelve randomly pooled tracheal allografts at day 7 in 
the presence or absence of neutralizing anti-VEGF or control Abs 
were placed in the CMP. Neutralizing anti-VEGF did not signifi￾cantly attenuate the angiogenic activity of allograft-treated tissue 
at day 7 (6 of 6 positive) compared with control Ab (5 of 6 positive). 
In addition, anti-VEGF blocked the activity of exogenous VEGF in 
this assay. These data suggest that CXCR2/CXCR2 ligands play 
a greater role in promoting angiogenesis than VEGF during the 
course of murine BOS.
Neutralization of CXCR2 inhibits angiogenic activity independently 
of reducing the infiltration of neutrophils during murine BOS. Besides 
endothelial cells, neutrophils also express CXCR2. On this basis, we 
next determined whether inhibiting CXCR2/CXCR2 ligand biol￾ogy decreases neutrophil recruitment during murine BOS. In vivo 
neutralization of endogenous murine CXCR2, as compared 
with control Ab, was performed as described above. Kinetics 
of FACS analysis on single-cell suspensions of whole trache￾al digests demonstrated that neutralizing anti-CXCR2 Ab 
reduced neutrophil infiltration at day 7 (Figure 8A). How￾ever, by days 14 and 21 neutralizing anti-CXCR2 had no 
significant effect on neutrophil infiltration. Based on these 
findings, the reduction in angiogenic activity using anti￾CXCR2 Ab during murine BOS could be a result of inhi￾bition of the early influx of neutrophils into the allograft 
(i.e., by reducing the numbers of infiltrating neutrophils 
and their potential expression of proangiogenic mediators). To 
explore this possibility, we performed neutrophil depletion stud￾ies in vivo during murine BOS. Neutrophil depletion was achieved 
by i.p. administration of RB6-8C5 Ab to recipients of tracheal

allografts starting at 1 day before transplantation and given every 
other day until day 17, compared with control Ab given every other 
day until day 17. The use of RB6-8C5 resulted in peripheral blood 
neutropenia. FACS analysis of single-cell suspensions of whole tra￾cheal digests demonstrated a significant reduction of infiltrating 
neutrophils in animals treated with RB6-8C5 Ab compared with 
control Ab at all time points evaluated (Figure 8B). We used the 
CMP assay to determine the effects of neutrophil depletion on 
angiogenic activity in tracheal allografts from recipients treated in 
vivo with RB6-8C5 Ab compared tracheal allografts from recipients 
treated with control Ab at days 7 and 21. We found that a simi￾lar angiogenic response was induced in pooled tracheal allograft 
homogenates from animals treated with RB6-8C5 Abs at days 7 
and 21 (n = 12 and n = 12; 5 of 6 and 6 of 6 positive, respectively) 
compared with tracheal allografts treated with control Abs (n = 12 
and n = 12; 6 of 6 and 6 of 6 positive, respectively) (Figure 
8C). To further analyze the effects of neutrophil depletion 
on vascular remodeling, we also performed FACS analysis 
of endothelial cells using MECA-32 on single-cell suspen￾sions of whole tracheal allograft digests at days 7 and 21. 
There was no significant difference in allograft endothelial 
cells at either time point (Figure 8D). These results dem￾onstrate that vascular remodeling of the tracheal allograft 
during the course of murine BOS occurs independently of 
infiltrating neutrophils within the allograft.
Inhibition of CXCR2/CXCR2 ligand biology results in the 
attenuation of murine BOS. With a significant reduction in 
angiogenic activity of the allografts from animals treated 
with anti-CXCR2 Ab, we next assessed whether there was 
any effect on the pathology of murine BOS. We used a 
quantitative overall cumulative BOS score (see Methods) 
based on 4 easily identifiable pathologic processes: airway 
lining epithelial loss, leukocyte infiltration, ECM deposi￾tion, and luminal obliteration, as previously described (19, 
20). Histopathologic analysis of tracheal allografts from 
recipient animals treated with anti-CXCR2 demonstrated 
marked reductions in overall cumulative BOS scores and 
hydroxyproline levels compared with animals treated with 
control Ab throughout day 21 (Figure 9, A–C). To exclude 
the possibility that the effect of anti-CXCR2 was related to 
neutrophils, we implanted animals with tracheal allografts 
and exposed them to either RB6-8C5 Ab or control Ab. 
While there was a significant reduction in overall cumula￾tive score at day 7, there was no effect of neutrophil deple￾tion on cumulative BOS scores and hydroxyproline levels 
at days 14 and 21 (Figure 10, A–C).
To further establish the role of CXCR2/CXCR2 ligand biologi￾cal axis in neutrophil recruitment in promoting angiogenesis dur￾ing BOS, we next compared the effects of: anti-CXCR2 Ab plus 
RB6-8C5 Ab; anti-CXCR2 Ab plus control 1 Ab (control Ab for 
RB6-8C5 Ab); control 2 Ab (control Ab for anti-CXCR2 Ab) plus 
RB6-8C5 Ab; and control 1 Ab plus control 2 Ab. We found a simi￾lar significant reduction in overall cumulative BOS scores and 
hydroxyproline levels in the anti-CXCR2 Ab plus anti-RB6-8C5 Ab 
group and the anti-CXCR2 Ab plus control 1 Ab group compared 
with the other groups throughout the 21-day time course (Figure 
11, A and B). However, the RB6-8C5 Ab plus control 2 Ab group 
only demonstrated a significant reduction in overall cumulative 
score at day 7 (i.e., the early allograft dysfunction phase) and not 
days 14 and 21 (i.e., late allograft dysfunction, BOS) (Figure 11A). 
These findings demonstrate a critical role for CXCR2/CXCR2

ligand biological axis in mediating vascular remodeling during the 
course of the fibro-obliterative phase of murine BOS independent 
of its effects on neutrophils.
The combination of inhibition of CXCR2/CXCR2 ligand biolo￾gy using CXCR2–/– recipients and CsA is synergistic for attenuat￾ing murine BOS: T cells and other mononuclear cells are involved 
in the pathogenesis of BOS. Calcineurin inhibitors such as CsA 
predominately affect T cell function and have contributed to 
increase survival of lung allografts (21). However, with the sig￾nificant side effects related to these reagents, any reduction in 
their dose would be important for the diminution of transplant 
recipient morbidity (21). For these reasons, we titrated (5, 10, 15, 
20, and 25 mg/kg/d) the lowest dose of CsA required to inhibit 
BOS at day 7, the time when significant leukocyte infiltration 
occurs. The dose of 20 mg/kg/d reduced overall 
cumulative BOS scores compared with the con￾trol oil-treated group at day 7. However, by day 
14, no significant reduction in overall cumula￾tive BOS scores was detected in the CsA-treated 
group compared with the control (oil) vehicle￾treated group. With this low dose of CsA atten￾uating BOS only at day 7, separate experiments 
were designed to evaluate the combination of 
CsA (20 mg/kg/d) and depletion of CXCR2. In 
these experiments CXCR2–/– or CXCR2+/+ mice 
on a C57BL/6 background were recipients of 
tracheas from BALB/c CXCR2+/+ mice. The 
recipient mice were exposed to CsA every day 
beginning at day 0 until the animals were sacri￾ficed at specified time points. We found marked 
reductions in overall cumulative BOS scores and 
hydroxyproline levels in allografts from CXCR2–/–
recipients treated with CsA through day 28 com￾pared with allografts from CXCR2+/+ recipient mice treated with 
CsA (Figure 12, A–C).
Discussion
BOS results from a chronic immunologic/inflammatory insult 
to the allograft airways that causes granulation tissue forma￾tion that ends in fibro-obliteration (2, 19, 20). While numerous 
studies have focused on angiogenesis during tumor growth, little 
attention has been paid to the role of angiogenesis during BOS. 
In addition, ELR+ CXC chemokines, known to be important regu￾lators of angiogenesis, have been largely ignored with regard to 
BOS. We hypothesized that persistent allogeneic injury to the lung 
allograft airway upregulates the expression of multiple ELR+ CXC 
chemokines, which interact with CXCR2-expressing endothelial

cells; this results in aberrant vascular remodeling in the context 
of the formation of granulation tissue around and within the 
allograft airway, the hallmark of BOS.
In this study, significant aberrant angiogenesis was demonstrat￾ed in lung biopsy specimens from patients with BOS. In addition, 
BALF from patients with FBOS, BOS, and TBOS had significant 
angiogenic activity. This is consistent with the findings that vascu￾lar remodeling is associated with the fibroplasia of ARDS and the 
pannus formation involved in RA (7, 10). However, to our knowl￾edge, this is the first study to describe an association of vascular 
remodeling and angiogenic activity in human BOS.
Since ELR+ CXC chemokines are potent regulators of 
angiogenesis, we evaluated multiple ELR+ CXC chemokines in 
BALF from patients with BOS. There were marked elevations in 
CXCL7 levels in the FBOS and BOS groups and CXCL3 and CXCL8 
levels in the FBOS, BOS, and TBOS groups. This demonstrates an 
association among multiple ELR+ CXC chemokines and angiogenic 
activity in BALF from patients with FBOS, BOS, and TBOS and 
expands upon previous data demonstrating an association between 
1 ELR+ CXC chemokine, CXCL8, and BOS (13, 15, 22–24). Further￾more, the elevated levels of multiple ELR+ CXC chemokines in the 
FBOS group suggest the possibility that a persistent, very low-grade 
allospecific injury to the allograft airways may be promoting the 
production of these chemokines and eventually leads to vascular 
remodeling, which is required to support the fibroplasia of BOS. 
This concept is supported by recent studies demon￾strating that minimal acute lung allograft rejection, 
if left untreated, leads to high-grade acute rejection/
lymphocytic bronchiolitis and eventual BOS (25). Alter￾natively, we cannot completely rule out the possibility 
of occult infections as a possible etiology. Moreover, our 
current treatment of BOS was not able to suppress the 
ELR+ CXC chemokine expression and had no effect on 
BOS, which suggests that one problem with this therapy may be its 
inability to suppress these chemokines, which are responsible, in 
part, for promoting angiogenesis and perpetuating BOS.
The fact that all ELR+ CXC chemokines mediate angiogenesis 
highlights the importance of identifying a common receptor. This 
would provide the unique opportunity to target a putative recep￾tor for ELR+ CXC chemokine–induced angiogenesis in the context 
of BOS. Recent studies have demonstrated CXCR2, not CXCR1, 
to be the receptor that mediates angiogenic activity (18, 26–32). 
Our data also demonstrate that the vascular remodeling associat￾ed with BOS lesions involves endothelial cells expressing CXCR2. 
This is analogous to the expression of CXCR2 on endothelial cells 
seen in tissue surrounding human cancers, pulmonary fibrosis, 
and wound granulation tissue (10, 11, 18, 27, 28, 33, 34). Based on 
these previous studies, we evaluated the role of elevated ELR+ CXC 
chemokines in promoting angiogenic activity during FBOS, BOS, 
and TBOS. We found that the angiogenic activity in BALF from 
patients with FBOS, BOS, and TBOS was predominately mediated 
by the CXCR2/CXCR2 ligand biological axis. These data are sup￾ported by studies demonstrating that the vascular remodeling of 
RA and pulmonary fibrosis is principally mediated by the CXCR2/
CXCR2 ligand biological axis (7, 8, 35). Interestingly, VEGF was 
not elevated in BALF from patients with FBOS, BOS, and TBOS, 
and anti-VEGF Ab did not inhibit angiogenic activity in BALF from 
patients with BOS. This confirms the results of previous studies

on humans, in which VEGF was not found to be associated with 
BOS (36), and the findings suggest a more important role for the 
ELR+ CXC chemokines compared with VEGF in propagating vas￾cular remodeling during the continuum of FBOS to BOS. Collec￾tively, these studies demonstrate an important association among 
augmented levels of ELR+ CXC chemokines, angiogenic activity, 
and vascular remodeling during the course of human fibroprolif￾erative/obliterative diseases.
Given the importance of CXCR2/CXCR2 ligands in promoting 
angiogenic activity in humans, we next performed proof-of-con￾cept studies using the heterotopic murine model of BOS. While this 
model has limitations due to its heterotopic positioning, which thus 
discounts the influence of adjacent airway mucosa, it has histopatho￾logic features similar to those of human BOS (19, 20, 37). Important￾ly, we found significant vascular remodeling and angiogenic activ￾ity in tracheal allografts compared with syngeneic controls, which 
led us to evaluate murine ELR+ CXC chemokines. Both CXCL1 and 
CXCL2/3 levels were elevated in the tracheal allografts compared 
with the syngeneic controls. Similarly, the level of CXCR2, the only 
murine ELR+ CXC chemokine receptor, was also markedly elevated 
in allografts. However, there was only a marked intragraft neutrophil 
infiltration at days 3 and 7, the time points consistent with ischemia/
reperfusion injury phase in this model. Therefore, it was anticipated 
that the CXCR2 and CXCR2 ligand levels would be elevated at days 
3 and 7. However it was surprising to find that CXCR2 and CXCR2 
ligand levels remained persistently elevated throughout the remain￾der of the time course (i.e., the fibroproliferative phase), even when 
minimal intragraft neutrophil infiltration was present. The kinetics 
of CXCR2 and CXCR2 ligands suggest that ELR+ CXC chemokines 
have an alternative function besides neutrophil recruitment during 
the fibroproliferative phase of BOS.
One alternative function of the ELR+ CXC chemokines is the 
promotion of angiogenesis (4). Thus the angiogenic potential of 
these chemokines was assessed during murine BOS. Similar to 
our human data, we found that inhibition of the CXCR2/CXCR2 
ligand biological axis with anti-CXCR2 both ex vivo or in vivo 
markedly reduced the angiogenic activity in the tracheal allografts. 
This was further confirmed by in vivo neutralization of CXCR2, 
which resulted in a reduction in endothelial cells in tracheal 
allografts from animals treated with anti-CXCR2 Ab. These data 
are supported by other studies involving models of lung cancer or 
pulmonary fibrosis in which inhibition of ELR+ CXC chemokines 
lead to a reduction in angiogenesis (8, 11, 35).
VEGF was also evaluated during murine BOS. While elevated lev￾els of VEGF were found at the earliest time point evaluated (i.e., day 
3), at later time points, levels were similar in both allografts and 
syngeneic controls, and VEGF was found to contribute little if at all 
to the angiogenic activity of tracheal allografts during the course 
of BOS. These data are in agreement with several studies dem￾onstrating that in certain disease processes, the CXCR2/CXCR2 
ligand biological axis is the major inducer of angiogenesis. For 
instance, in studies using a murine single lung ligation model in 
the absence of hypoxemia, there was a marked angiogenic response 
associated with elevated levels of the ELR+ CXC chemokines and 
not VEGF (9, 38). Similarly in a SCID xenograft model of human 
glioblastoma, downregulation of the tumor suppressor gene ING4
led to the upregulation of CXCL8-mediated, but not VEGF-medi￾ated, angiogenesis (9). These studies demonstrate that in specific 
tumors as well as fibroproliferative diseases, ELR+ CXC chemokines 
can be the predominate mediators of angiogenesis.
Based on the finding of a reduction in angiogenesis in tracheal 
allografts from animals treated with the anti-CXCR2 Ab, murine 
BOS was evaluated. Tracheal allografts from the animals treated 
with anti-CXCR2 had significant reductions in BOS scores and 
hydroxyproline levels. This is similar to the findings in murine 
models of pulmonary fibrosis, where inhibition of vascular remod￾eling led to a reduction in fibrosis (8). However, the anti-CXCR2 
Ab did cause a reduction in neutrophils during the early (ischemia/
reperfusion injury) phase of allograft dysfunction. In addition, 
other studies have demonstrated that depletion of neutrophils 
or using mice deficient in the src family kinases (Hck and Fgr), 
which have alterations in granulocyte migration, results in inhi￾bition of angiogenesis by reducing the expression of VEGF (39, 
40). These studies suggest that the paracrine production of VEGF 
from neutrophils is responsible for angiogenesis. On this basis, we 
performed neutrophil depletion experiments to specifically deter￾mine the effect on angiogenesis during murine BOS. There was a 
reduction in allograft damage only at day 7, consistent with pre￾vious data demonstrating that neutrophils are important during 
early allograft (ischemia/reperfusion injury) dysfunction (41–43). 
In contrast, neutrophil depletion did not affect vascular remodel￾ing or fibro-obliteration. This demonstrates that the angiogenic 
activity of the allografts was independent of infiltrating allograft 
neutrophils but was dependent on the CXCR2/CXCR2 ligand 
biological axis. This was confirmed by the finding that there 
was no synergistic or additive effect of neutrophil depletion plus 
anti-CXCR2 Ab treatment compared with inhibition of CXCR2 
alone. Collectively these studies suggest that the effects of the 
CXCR2/CXCR2 ligand biological axis are bimodal during BOS: 
early, it effects neutrophil recruitment (i.e., during the ischemia/
reperfusion injury phase), and later, it effects vascular remodeling 
and angiogenesis (i.e., during the fibroproliferative phase) inde￾pendently of neutrophil recruitment.
Last, we determined the effects of combining CsA treatment with 
the inhibition of CXCR2 interactions with its ligands. We chose 
CXCR2–/– recipients to avoid serum sickness in wild-type mice due 
to prolonged use (i.e., 28 days) of the anti-CXCR2 Ab in combina￾tion with CsA and found a reduction in collagen deposition and 
BOS. In fact, these are the best results we have seen as of yet in 
this model. These findings demonstrate that the combination of 
inhibiting angiogenesis and immunosuppression may be a novel 
way to protect lung allografts from BOS.
In conclusion, we have demonstrated that multiple ELR+ CXC 
chemokines are associated with human BOS. In addition, these 
chemokine interactions with their shared receptor, CXCR2, are 
important inducers of angiogenic activity during human BOS. 
Proof-of-concept studies using the murine model of BOS dem￾onstrated that these ELR+ CXC chemokines have a bimodal func￾tion. Acutely, they are responsible for intragraft neutrophil infil￾tration during ischemia/reperfusion injury, and chronically, they 
are responsible for the vascular remodeling needed to support the 
fibroproliferative phase of the disease independent of neutrophil 
infiltration. The findings of this study may ultimately result in 
novel therapies designed to attenuate the CXCR2/CXCR2 ligand 
biological axis and lead to better intervention in the prevention 
and treatment of BOS.

prospectively enrolled all patients undergoing lung transplantation from 
June 1992 to April 2000. Patients were eligible for this study if they sur￾vived at least 6 months after transplantation. One hundred and sixty-nine 
patients were evaluated, of which 47, who had never had an episode of 
acute rejection or BOS, met criteria for being healthy lung transplantation 
recipients; and 30 met criteria for having BOS and for whom clinical or 
laboratory data demonstrated no allograft colonization or infection. All 
transplantation recipients were routinely followed according to a standard 
protocol. This protocol included clinical visits weekly for the first 3 weeks, 
then at 6 weeks, and then at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. Subsequently, they 
were seen every 4 months for the second year and thereafter annually. The 
clinic visit involved a history, physical examination, pulmonary function 
testing, and a bronchoscopy. Bronchoscopy was also performed at times 
when either infection or rejection was suspected. We chose the most recent 
available BALF samples in the healthy group to try to ensure an effective 
comparison of duration after transplantation between the healthy trans￾plant recipients and patients with BOS. As shown in Table 3, there was no 
significant difference in the duration in months after lung transplantation 
between the 4 groups.
The third group evaluated was a subpopulation of the BOS group called 
FBOS (n = 28). For this group of BOS patients, BALF samples were taken 
from the last bronchoscopy without colonization, infection, acute rejection, 
or BOS. The fourth group, TBOS (n = 10), were BOS recipients that had 
undergone treatment with either pulse methylprednisolone, monoclonal 
OKT3, or anti-thymocyte globulin Ab; and had undergone clinical evalu￾ation with pulmonary function testing (PFT) and bronchoscopy within 6 
weeks of the treatment. Unfortunately, none of the patients treated for BOS 
had a response, as demonstrated by clinical parameters and by PFT criteria.
BALF was obtained from healthy lung transplant recipients and those 
with FBOS, BOS, TBOS by methods previously described (19, 44, 45). The 
cell-free solution was aliquoted and frozen immediately at –70°C until it was 
thawed for ELR+ CXC chemokine ELISAs (19, 20, 44, 45). Throughout the 
entire study, we excluded any BALF obtained at a time when infection and/or 
colonization was diagnosed with the following criteria: a positive BALF or 
transbronchial biopsy by cytology or microbiology Gram stain and culture 
for bacterial, acid fast bacillus, fungus, cytomegalovirus (virology testing for 
CMV) included cytology, rapid shell-vial culture, and conventional tube cul￾ture), other respiratory virus, or Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia.
Diagnosis of BOS and healthy lung transplant recipients. Patients were diag￾nosed with BOS on the basis of an unexplained and sustained decrease 
in the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) by 20% or more of the 
peak predicted value after transplantation with or without pathologic 
evidence of BOS, as previously described (46). Patients diagnosed with 
acute rejection based on pathological findings by transbronchial biopsy 
were excluded (46). Healthy transplant recipients were those patients 
undergoing surveillance bronchoscopy for whom there had never been 
any clinical or biopsy evidence of acute rejection or BOS.
Immunosuppression and prophylactic antimicrobials. Patients were placed 
on a standard pre- and post-transplantation immunosuppression proto￾col including treatment with cyclosporine or tacrolimus, azathioprine or 
mycophenolate mofetil, methylprednisolone, and prophylactic antibiotics 
and antivirals, as previously described (19, 45). All episodes of acute lung 
allograft rejection were treated with a 3-day pulse of methylprednisolone at 
1 g/d without adjustment of daily prednisone.
Reagents. Abs to human CXCL1, CXCL3, CXCL5, CXCL7, CXCL8, VEGF, 
and murine VEGF were purchased from R&D Systems. Biotinylated 
and non-biotinylated anti-murine CXCL1 was purchased from R&D 
Systems. Polyclonal rabbit anti-murine CXCL2/3 Abs used for ELISAs 
were produced by the immunization of a rabbit with murine recombi￾nant CXCL2/3 (R&D Systems), as previously described (11, 47–50). Goat 
polyclonal Ab to murine and rabbit polyclonal Ab to human CXCR2 
were generated using a 17-mer peptide constituting the amino terminus 
of the mouse CXCR2 (MGEFKVDKFNIEDFFSG) and a 21-mer peptide 
constituting the amino terminus of human CXCR2 (CMEDFNMESDS￾FEDFWKGEDL), respectively, as previously described (8, 44, 47, 48). The 
anti–mouse CXCR2 Ab has been shown to be specific to rodent CXCR2 
and does not alter peripheral blood neutrophil counts, as previously 
described (10, 11, 18, 47, 48). The specificity of the anti–human CXCR2 
Ab has been previously described (18). RB6-8C5 Ab is a rat anti-mouse 
monoclonal immunoglobulin 2b against Ly-6G, an antigen expressed on 
mature murine granulocytes but not their precursors, and has previously 
been shown to induce a neutrophil deficiency (51–55).
ELR+ CXC chemokine ELISAs. We quantitated human CXCL1, CXCL3, 
CXCL5, CXCL7, CXCL8, and murine CXCL1 and CXCL2/3 protein using 
the double ligand method as previously described (8, 44).
Endothelial cell chemotaxis. HLMVECs at passage 5 were harvested by tryp￾sinization and preincubated with either anti-hCXCR2 or control Ab at 
37°C for 1 hour (Cambrex Corp.). Endothelial cell chemotaxis assays to 
a vehicle control, 50 ng/ml of CXCL8 and BALF pooled from 8 randomly 
selected patients from the FBOS, BOS, TBOS, and healthy groups were 
performed as previously described (18, 32). Results were expressed as the 
number of endothelial cells that migrated per high-power field (HPF).
CMP assay of angiogenesis. Angiogenic activity of BALF was assayed in 
vivo in the avascular cornea of hooded Long-Evans rat eyes, as previously 
described (8, 10, 35). Human VEGF 165 and murine VEGF 164 (R&D Sys￾tems) were used as positive controls when appropriate.
Murine BOS model. We used a well-established and reproducible murine 
model of BOS involving heterotopic subcutaneous trachea transplantation 
as previously described (19, 20). We used an MHC class I– and II–disparate 
combination of BALB/c (H-2d) to C57BL/6 (H-2b) (allografts) and C57BL/6 
(H-2b) to C57BL/6 (H-2b) (syngeneic controls). In separate experiments, ani￾mals received either anti-CXCR2 Ab or RB6-8C5 Ab or the combination of 
both as compared with appropriate control Abs on days 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 
and 15 by i.p. injection. In addition, to create experiments analogous to the 
clinical setting, we titrated the lowest dose of CsA (mixed in Cremophor EL 
castor oil; Sigma-Aldrich) given i.p. (5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 mg/kg/d) to atten￾uate BOS at day 7, but not day 14, as compared to control (Cremophor EL). 
After determining that a dose of 20 mg/kg/d significantly attenuated BOS 
at day 7, but not day 14, we then performed experiments in which CsA (20 
mg/kg/d) was injected i.p. into CXCR2–/– and CXCR2+/+ allograft recipients 
on a C57/BL6 background starting at postoperative day 0 and given every 
day until sacrifice. All studies were approved by the UCLA institutional ani￾mal care and use committee.
Histopathologic grading of BOS. Three random 3-μm paraffin-embedded tis￾sue sections for 5 different trachea allografts were stained with H&E at 3 
time points: days 7, 14, and 21. A blind assessment of the histopathology 
was performed using a modified histologic scoring system based on air￾Table 3

way lining epithelial loss, deposition of ECM, leukocyte infiltration, and 
luminal obliteration, as previously described (19, 20).
FACS analysis of neutrophils and endothelial cells. Tracheal single-cell suspen￾sion preparations were made using a previously described method (19, 44). 
Single-cell suspensions were stained with primary Abs: PerCP anti-mCD45 
(BD Biosciences), PE anti-murine Ly-6G (neutrophil surface marker; BD 
Biosciences), biotin-conjugated anti-mouse MECA-32 (BD Biosciences), and 
anti-CXCR2 or isotype controls. The secondary Abs used for these experi￾ments was Alexa Fluor 488 (Invitrogen Corp.) for CXCR2 and streptavidin￾PE (BD Biosciences) for MECA-32. Dual-color-stained cell suspensions were 
analyzed on a FACScan flow cytometer using CellQuest 3.2.1f1 software (BD 
Biosciences — Immunocytometry Systems) as previously described (19, 44).
Total RNA isolation and real-time quantitative PCR. Total cellular RNA was 
isolated as previously described (8, 44). Total RNA was determined and 
reversed transcribed into cDNA and amplified using TaqMan Reverse 
Transcription Reagents (Applied Biosystems). We performed real-time 
quantitative PCR with specific TaqMan primers and probes, using the 
ABI Prism 7700 Sequence Detector and SDS analysis software (Applied 
Biosystems). Negative control experiments were performed as follows: real￾time quantitative PCR was performed without RT to exclude contamina￾tion and amplification of genomic DNA; and without cDNA template 
to exclude reagent contamination with DNA. CXCL1, CXCR2, and 18s 
TaqMan Pre-Developed Assay Reagent (PDAR) (Applied Biosystems) were 
used, and CXCL2/3 primers and probe sequence (forward primer, reverse 
primer, TaqMan probe) were as follows: AGGGCAGGAGCGAATTTAAAA, 
TGCGATCTCCCCACAGCT, AGGCCAGGGTGGGCGGAGG.
Quantitative analysis of gene expression was done using the comparative 
CT (ΔCT) method, in which CT is the threshold cycle number (20, 56). The 
formula for the ΔCT method is described as the difference in threshold 
cycles for a target (i.e., CXCL1) and an endogenous reference (i.e., house￾keeping gene 18S). The amount of target normalized to an endogenous ref￾erence (i.e., CXCL1 in allografts at day 3) and relative to a calibration nor￾malized to an endogenous reference (i.e., CXCL1 in syngeneic controls at 
day 3) is given by 2–ΔΔCT, which is the fold increase in CXCL1 of the allograft 
compared with the syngeneic control, as previously described (20, 56).
Immunohistochemistry for F8Ag and CXCR2. Three random 3-μm paraf￾fin-embedded tissue sections from 5 human BOS patients compared with 
normal lung tissue controls were assessed by immunohistochemical local￾ization of either appropriate control Ab, F8Ag, or CXCR2 using goat anti￾F8Ag (Biomeda Corp.) and rabbit anti-hCXCR2 as previously described 
(10). Three random 3-μm paraffin-embedded tissue sections from 5 
different day 7 and day 21 murine tracheal allografts, compared with 5 
different day 7 and day 21 syngeneic control tissues, were processed for 
immunohistochemical localization of either appropriate control Ab, goat 
anti-F8Ag (Biomeda Corp.), or goat anti-mCXCR2 as previously described 
(10). Morphometric analysis of vascular remodeling was quantitated by 
counting the number of F8Ag-positive vessels per ×400 HPF (n = 50; 5 mea￾surements from 2 sections of each of the 5 sample blocks).
Hydroxyproline assay. Prior to removal, heterotopically transplanted trache￾as were dissected free of surrounding tissue, and total tracheal collagen was 
determined by analysis of hydroxyproline as previously described (8, 19, 20).
Statistical analysis. Data were analyzed using the Statview 4.5 statistical 
software package (Abacus Concepts Inc.). All human group comparisons 
were evaluated by the nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn post￾hoc analysis. Data are displayed using a box plot summary. The horizontal 
line represents the median, the box encompasses the 25th to 75th percen￾tile, and the error bars encompass the 10th to the 90th percentile. All ani￾mal group comparisons were evaluated by the ANOVA test with Bonfer￾roni/Dunn post-hoc analysis. Data are expressed as mean ± SEM.
