Abstract
Background: Dendritic cells (DCs) release bioactive exosomes that play an important role in immune regulation. Because
they express low levels of class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and co-stimulatory molecules, exosomes derived
from donor immature DCs (imDex) prolong allograft survival by inhibiting T-cell activation. However, this effect is limited
and does not induce immunological tolerance when imDex are administered alone. Thus, we tested the effect of combined
treatment with donor imDex and low-dose rapamycin on inducing tolerance in a mouse cardiac transplantation model.
Methods: ImDex were obtained from the culture supernatant of immature DCs derived from donor mouse (C57BL/6) bone
marrow and were injected with suboptimal doses of rapamycin into recipient mouse (BALB/c) before and after
transplantation. The capacity of this treatment to induce immune tolerance was analyzed in vitro and in vivo using the
mouse cardiac transplantation model.
Results: Donor imDex expressed moderate levels of MHC class II and low levels of MHC class I and co-stimulatory molecules,
but neither imDex nor subtherapeutic rapamycin dose alone induced cardiac allograft tolerance. Combined treatment with
imDex and rapamycin, however, led to donor specific cardiac allograft tolerance. This effect was accompanied by decreased
anti-donor antigen cellular response and an increased percentage of spleen CD4+
CD25+ T cells in recipients. Furthermore,
this donor specific tolerance could be further transferred to naı¨ve allograft recipients through injection of splenocytes, but
not serum, from tolerant recipients.
Conclusion: Combined with immunosuppressive treatment, donor imDex can prolong cardiac allograft survival and induce
donor specific allograft tolerance.

Introduction
Organ transplantation is almost the only hope of complete cure
for patients with organ failure. In addition to organ shortage,
immune rejection is the biggest obstacle to the development of
organ transplantation [1]. Although non-specific immunosuppres￾sants can suppress immune rejection and prolong allograft
survival, long-term use of these drugs causes serious adverse
reactions, such as increased occurrence of opportunistic infections
or increased cancer recurrence rate [2]. Thus, donor specific
tolerance must be established and maintained to reduce the dosage
of immunosuppressants [3].
Dendritic cells (DCs) are the professional antigen-presenting
cells (APCs) that present donor alloantigen to recipient T cells.
The view that immature and mature DCs mediate different
functional T-cell responses (i.e., tolerance versus priming) is very
common, and the effect of immature DCs (imDCs) on inducing
transplantation tolerance has been tested in many different animal
transplantation models. However, this DC-based technology has
some deficiencies that limit its application in the clinic, including
potential maturation and short-term lifetime in vivo, the require￾ment of 7 days (d) for production, and short-term preservation in
vitro [4,5]. Thus, donor imDCs cannot be used repeatedly and do
not induce sufficient immune tolerance.
Exosomes are small membrane vesicles (diameter 50–100 nm)
of late endocytic compartment origin secreted by a variety of cell
types [6]. DC-derived exosomes (Dex) present antigen-major
histocompatibility complex (MHC) and co-stimulatory molecules
to T lymphocytes and therefore have strong immunological
regulatory activities [7,8]. Depending on the maturation state of
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 August 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 8 | e44045

DCs producing exosomes, Dex induces T-cell tolerance or
priming. Mature DC-derived exosomes (mDex) trigger effector
T-cell response and lead to fast skin allograft rejection [9], whereas
imDC-derived exosomes (imDex) display a certain degree of
immunosuppressive activity in autoimmune diseases [10–12] and
animal models of allogenetic organ transplantation [13–15].
Moreover, as imDex are stable and can be easily stored in vitro,
they may be a good substitute for imDCs in inducing immune
tolerance. However, there are few reports on the utility of imDex
as an immunosuppressant, and only two findings show that
treatment with imDex alone induces limited immunosuppressant
activity without inducing tolerance [13,14].
In this study, we analyzed the effect of allogenetic donor imDex,
purified from mouse bone marrow (BM), on tolerance induction in
a mouse model of heart transplantation. We found that low doses
(10 mg) of donor imDex could significantly prolong cardiac
allograft survival, but this was limited. To increase graft survival,
therefore, we used imDex together with a subtherapeutic regimen
(1 mg/kg/d) of rapamycin. Impressively, the combination of
imDex and rapamycin led to donor specific cardiac allograft
tolerance, and this effect was accompanied by decreased anti￾donor antigen cellular response and an increased percentage of
spleen CD4+
CD25+ T cells in recipients. These findings demon￾strate that donor imDex in combination with an immunosuppres￾sant can induce donor specific allograft tolerance and thus prolong
cardiac allograft survival.
Results
Characterization of Exosomes Derived from DCs
Eight days after culturing in the presence of granulocyte
macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and recombi￾nant interleukin-4 (IL-4), murine BM cells developed a typical DC
profile as reported by Lutz et al. [16]. Phenotypic profiles of
mature DCs (lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated) and imDCs (un￾treated) analyzed by fluorescence-activated cells sorting (FACS).
Mature DCs (mDCs) expressed high levels of MHC class I, class II,
and co-stimulatory CD80 and CD86 compared with imDCs. The
DC marker NLDC-145 showed exclusive staining in mDCs but
was reduced in imDCs, whereas CD11c was moderately expressed
in both mDCs and imDCs. These data proved that DCs were
immature throughout the culture period in the presence of GM￾CSF and IL-4. Exosomes were purified from culture supernatants
of mDCs and imDCs by ultrafiltration and ultracentrifugation
[17]. We obtained about 0.3560.1 mg and 0.9460.2 mg of
exosome proteins (as measured by Bradford assay) from one
million mDCs and imDCs, respectively. The morphology of
exosomes observed by electron microscopy. The purified exo￾somes showed typical heterogeneous vesicle structures ranging
from 60 to 90 nm in diameter. A typical phenotypic profile of
imDex and mDex is shown in Figure 1A. Lower levels of MHC
class I and co-stimulatory CD80 and CD86 were expressed in
imDex than mDex. MHC class II, which was highly expressed in
mDex, was slightly down-modulated in imDex. Additionally, we
analyzed the expression of HSP70, HSP90, MFG-E8, and ICAM￾1 by western blotting (Figure 1B). HSP70 and HSP90 were present
in similar amounts in imDex and mDex, but ICAM-1 expression
was relatively higher and MFG-E8 was relatively lower in mDex.
Administration of Donor imDex in Combination with
Low-Dose Rapamycin Prolongs Survival of Cardiac
Allografts
Some reports have shown that administration of donor imDex
before transplantation significantly prolongs allograft survival of
heart or intestine in rat transplantation models [13,14]. However,
transplant immunological tolerance or long-term graft survival was
not achieved, and the role of imDex treatment in allograft
transplantation was not completely clear. Thus, we treated
recipients with donor imDex alone or in combination with low￾dose rapamycin and analyzed the effects on survival of cardiac
allografts. First, we tested the effects of different doses of donor
imDex. We established a murine model of cardiac allotransplan￾tation, and treated BALB/c recipients with 0.1, 1, 10, 25, or 50 mg
imDex derived from a C57BL/6 donor. The imDex were injected
via caudal vein 7 d before, the day of, and 7 d after transplan￾tation. As shown in Table 1 and Figure 2A, treatment with 0.1 or
1 mg of donor imDex (median survival time (MST): 8 d for 0.1 mg,
n = 7; 12.5 d for 1 mg, n = 8) did not prolong allograft survival
compared with the untreated recipients (MST: 7.5 d, n = 8);
treatment with 10 mg imDex (MST: 27 days, n = 8), however,
significantly prolonged allograft survival (P,0.001). Notably,
allograft survival decreased when the dose of donor imDex
increased above 10 mg. We found that treatment with 25 mg
imDex (MST: 14 d, n = 8) also prolonged allograft survival
compared with untreated recipients (P = 0.042), but the effect
was significantly weaker than for treatment with 10 mg imDex
(P = 0.001). Finally, treatment with 50 mg imDex (MST: 12 d,
n = 7) did not affect allograft survival compared with the untreated
recipients (P = 0.192). Thus, treatment of the recipient mice with a
low-dose (10 mg) of donor imDex before and after transplantation
inhibited the immunological rejection of the cardiac allograft and
significantly prolonged allograft survival.
To determine whether this effect was donor specific, we injected
10 mg imDex derived from BALB/c (recipient) or CBA/H (third￾party) mice into BALB/c recipient mice, but we found that neither
prolonged cardiac allograft survival (MST: 8 d for BALB/c imDex
and 9.5 d for CBA/H imDex; Figure 2B and Table 1), indicating
that the effect was donor specific. Notably, increased doses of
donor imDex did not induce accelerated rejection despite the
negative effect on allograft survival, suggesting that administration
of donor imDex via caudal vein before transplantation does not
sensitize the recipients.
Although a low dose (10 mg) donor imDex significantly
prolonged cardiac allograft survival in our experiments, this effect
was limited and merely yielded MST of 27 d and a maximum
survival of 51 d. To improve allograft survival, we used 10 mg
donor imDex together with a short course of immunosuppression
intended to develop tolerance in the immunological microenvi￾ronment in vivo. Rapamycin–the mammalian target of rapamycin
(mTOR) inhibitor -blocks DC maturation [18,19], inhibits
capacity of DC to stimulate T cells even following exposure to
LPS [20], and prolongs organ allograft survival [21]. Thus, we
hypothesized that 10 mg donor imDex combined with a short
course of minimally effective rapamycin could induce immuno￾logical tolerance and effectively promote allograft survival. To test
this hypothesis, we treated recipient mice with a subtherapeutic
regimen of 1 mg/kg/d rapamycin injected via caudal vein for 11
consecutive days (days -3 to 7) with or without donor imDex. We
found that this combination dramatically induced long-term
cardiac allograft survival (MST: 92 d, n = 7; Table 1 and
Figure 2C), whereas the subtherapeutic regimen of rapamycin
alone did not significantly prolong allograft survival (MST: 19 d,
n = 6; Table 1 and Figure 2C). We also confirmed that this effect
was specific for donor antigen by combining injection of the
subtherapeutic regimen of rapamycin with 10 mg imDex derived
from either recipient or third-party mice and found that these
treatments had no significant effect on allograft survival (MST:
21 d for imDex/rapamycin-cotreatment, n = 6; 17 d for third￾Exosomes Induce Transplantation Tolerance

party imDex/rapamycin-cotreatment, n = 6; Figure 2C and
Table 1).
The Combination of Rapamycin and Donor imDex
Decreases the Cellular Response against Donor Antigen
Post-Transplantation
To determine the mechanism of the cardiac allograft
tolerance induced by imDex/rapamycin-cotreatment, we assess￾ed the anti-donor cellular response in recipients after transplan￾tation; at 5 or 10 d post-transplantation, total splenocytes and
purified splenic T lymphocytes were separated from different
recipients, which included untreated recipients (n = 6, 3 mice
each for d5 and d10), recipients of donor imDex (n = 5, 3 mice
for d5 and 2 mice for d10) or rapamycin (n = 6, 3 mice each for
d5 and d10) alone, and imDex/rapamycin-cotreated recipients
(n = 6, 3 mice each for d5 and d10). These splenocytes and
splenic T lymphocytes were responder cells. Stimulator cells
were splenocytes from donor (C57BL/6) or third party (CBA/
H) treated with mitomycin C for 24 hours (h). Responder cells
(56104
) were co-cultured with stimulator cells (26104
) for 72 h.
Cell proliferation was quantified by incubating the cells with
1 mCi [3
H]-thymidine during the last 18 h of co-culture. Total
splenocytes from imDex/rapamycin-cotreated recipients induced
a significant decrease in proliferation against donor splenocytes
compared with responder cells from untreated recipients (d5:
P,0.001, d10: P,0.001). Total splenocytes from recipients
treated with donor imDex or rapamycin alone also negatively
affected the anti-donor antigen cellular response compared with
splenocytes from untreated recipients (d5: P = 0.164, d10:
P = 0.008, for donor imDex; d5: P = 0.004, d10: P,0.001, for
rapamycin), but splenocytes from recipients treated with donor
imDex or rapamycin alone were 4- to 5-fold less efficient than
those from recipients co-treated with imDex and rapamycin
(Figure 3A). However, splenocytes from the four groups
proliferated equivalently against the third-party CBA/H spleno￾cytes (Figure 3B). These results were also observed in
proliferation of purified T lymphocytes against donor or third￾party splenocytes (Figure 3C–D). Furthermore, we assessed
activation of T lymphocytes by measuring upregulation of the
early activation marker CD69 after splenic T lymphocytes
purified from different recipients (10 d after transplantation)
were co-cultured with stimulator cells for 24 h. T lymphocytes
of imDex/rapamycin-cotreated recipients expressed lower levels
of CD69 compared with those of untreated recipients (Figure 3E,
P,0.001). The levels of CD69 were also downregulated on T
lymphocytes of donor imDex-treated or rapamycin-treated
recipients compared with those of untreated recipients, but
were significantly different than those of imDex/rapamycin￾cotreated recipients (P = 0.013 for rapamycin; P = 0.025 for
imDex). However, CD69 was expressed similarly on splenocytes
of the four groups against third-party CBA/H lymphocytes
(Figure 3F). We concluded that activation and proliferation of T

lymphocytes against donor antigen are more efficiently inhibited
by rapamycin/imDex-cotreatment than by donor imDex treat￾ment alone.
Treatment with Donor imDex and Rapamycin Induces
Spleen CD4+
CD25+ T Cells in Recipient Mice
The inhibition of T lymphocyte activation and proliferation
against donor antigen suggested that treatment with imDex plus
rapamycin may favor expansion of the percentage of
CD4+
CD25+
Fox3+ regulatory T (Treg) cells. To this end,
purified splenic T lymphocytes were collected from untreated
recipients (n = 6), recipients of donor imDex (n = 6) or rapamy￾cin (n = 6) treatment alone, and imDex/rapamycin-cotreated
recipients (n = 6) 5 or 10 d after transplantation. The percent of
CD4+
CD25+ T cells was analyzed by FACS, and the Foxp3
expression level was analyzed by western blotting. As shown in
Figure 4A, treatment with imDex/rapamycin resulted in a
notable increase in the proportion of CD4+
CD25+ T cells
compared with that of the untreated group (d5: 12% 60.9%
versus 2% 60.4%, P,0.001; d10: 11% 61.4% versus 3%
60.2%, P,0.001). Treatment with donor imDex or rapamycin
alone also increased the proportion of CD4+
CD25+ T cells, but
neither treatment was as efficient as imDex/rapamycin-cotreat￾ment (d5: P,0.001, d10: P,0.001, for donor imDex; d5:
P = 0.001, d10: P,0.001, for rapamycin). Western blotting
showed enhanced production of Foxp3 in purified splenic T
lymphocytes from imDex/rapamycin-cotreated recipients as
compared with untreated recipients (d5: P = 0.007, d10:
P,0.001; Figure 4B). Moreover, we found a striking 1.7- to
1.9-fold decrease in Foxp3 expression in recipients treated with
donor imDex or rapamycin alone as compared with recipients
cotreated with imDex and rapamycin. These data indicated that
the combination of imDex and rapamycin may inhibit
proliferation and activation of alloreactive T lymphocytes,
which is closely related to increased proportion of the spleen
CD4+
CD25+ T cells in recipients.

Administration of Donor imDex in Combination with
Low-Dose Rapamycin Prevents Acute Cardiac Allograft
Rejection Lesions
To determine the degree of the benefit of the combination of
donor imDex with rapamycin for preventing acute cardiac
allograft rejection lesions, we harvested hearts of untreated
(n = 3) and imDex/rapamycin-cotreated (n = 3) recipients 7 d
post-transplantation and examined the histology of these allografts.
A heart of syngenetic transplantation (BALB/c to BALB/c) was
used as a control. Upon gross examination, the heart of the
untreated recipient was obviously congestive and edematous, but
the imDex/rapamycin-cotreated recipient’s heart was similar to
the control (Figure 5A). As compared with the control (Figure 5F
and 5G), microscopic examination of allografts of the untreated
group showed severe lymphocyte infiltration and interstitial
edema, which are signs of acute graft rejection (Figure 5B and
5C). By contrast, the allografts of imDex/rapamycin-cotreated
recipients displayed minor pathological changes of acute graft
rejection (Figure 5D and 5E). These results indicated that
administration of donor imDex in combination with rapamycin
can efficiently prevent acute cardiac allograft rejection.
Tolerance Induced by Cotreatment with imDex and
Rapamycin Is Donor Specific and Transferable
To assess whether the recipients cotreated with imDex and
rapamycin displayed donor specific tolerance, these mice had a
second heart from donor mice (C57BL/6, n = 3) or third-party
mice (CBA/H, n = 3) transplanted in the neck. Three naı¨ve
BALB/c mice that received hearts from C57BL/6 mice were used
as controls. As shown in Table 2, the cardiac allografts from donor
mice survived longer than the hearts from third-party mice and
control mice (MST: .100 d for donor hearts; 21 d for third-party
hearts; 9 d for control group).
To determine whether the tolerance in imDex/rapamycin￾cotreated recipients was transferable, we injected serum or
splenocytes from tolerant recipients (n = 3) or naı¨ve mice (n = 3)
into naı¨ve irradiated BALB/c mice via the caudal vein and then
transplanted C57BL/6 mouse hearts into them. As shown in
Table 3, the administration of splenocytes derived from tolerant
mice significantly prolonged the cardiac allograft survival (MST:
83 d), but the splenocytes derived from naı¨ve BALB/c mice did
not exhibit this effect (MST: 16 d). We also found that the transfer
of serum derived from the tolerant recipients prolonged the
allograft survival to a limited extent compared with the splenocytes
of tolerant recipients (MST: 44 d). These data suggested that
tolerance induced by imDex/rapamycin-cotreatment is donor
specific and transferable, and it may be mediated by recipient
immunoregulatory cells but not by recipient serum.
Discussion
The principle method for generating immature BM-DCs with
GM-CSF plus IL-4 was first reported by Inaba et al. [22] and
Sallusto et al. [23]. So, we applied this conventional method to
obtain imDCs that expressed lower MHC class I and co￾stimulatory CD80 and CD86 than DCs stimulated with LPS,
and this is consistent with many reported data [16,24]. Next, we
extracted exosomes from the culture supernatant of imDCs or
mDCs and comparatively analyzed the differences in morphology
and protein composition between the two kinds of Dex. Although
there were no significant differences in morphology, there was a
large difference in protein composition. Similar to imDCs, imDex
expressed the ‘‘tolerance’’ phenotype with low levels of MHC class
I, CD80, and CD86 and moderate levels of MHC class II
molecules. Meanwhile, imDex expressed lower levels of ICAM-1
than mDex, which is necessary for the immune activity of mDex
and as a major exosomal protein for inducing immune rejection to
skin allografts [9]. These results suggest that imDex have the
potential to induce immune tolerance. Thus, we injected donor
imDex into recipients before and after transplantation, and found
that treatment with 10 mg of donor imDex significantly prolonged
cardiac allograft survival, but this effect decreased when imDex
dose was increased. This effect was donor specific because imDex
from syngenetic mice or third-party mice had no such effect.
The above results indicate that, compared with imDCs, use of
imDex to induce immune tolerance has several advantages. First,
as a source of donor antigens, imDex can be frozen long-term in

vitro without affecting biological activity [25], so imDex can be
prepared quickly and used immediately when necessary. Second,
because only a small amount of imDex is needed to prolong
allograft survival, it can be used repeatedly on recipients if
necessary. Third, imDex do not undergo maturation in vivo,
which is a crucial drawback in current DC-based therapies for
tolerance induction. Finally, large doses of donor imDex (50 mg)
do not accelerate immune rejection, so it is safe to treat recipients

with donor imDex through the veins before transplantation, and
the donor imDex do not sensitize recipients against donor
antigens.
Previous reports showed that the role of exosomes in developing
tolerance or immunity depends not only on the stage and type of
the secreting cells but also on the state of the immune
microenvironment where the exosome-APC interaction takes
place [11,26]. In our study, although a low dose of donor imDex
significantly prolonged cardiac allograft survival, this effect was
limited and was insufficient to induce immune tolerance. We
considered that donor imDex should be combined with non￾specific immunosuppressive therapy to develop a tolerance
microenvironment in vivo. Rapamycin was thus used to favor
the presentation of alloantigens in a tolerogenic fashion because it
blocks T-cell activation, inhibits DCs maturation, and selectively
allows for proliferation while fostering the suppressive function of
Foxp3+ Treg cells [27,28]. We observed that the combination of
low-dose rapamycin and donor imDex induced long-term cardiac
allograft survival, but rapamycin alone did not have this effect.
This result suggests that, in a steady and tolerogenic state, imDex￾delivered donor antigens will prevent immune rejection and
promote immune tolerance.
Although the exact mechanism remains unclear, there is
increasing evidence that donor APC-derived exosomes adminis￾tered intravenously might participate in induction and mainte￾nance of peripheral T-cell tolerance. Morelli et al. [29] reported
that circulating allogeneic exosomes are efficiently captured by
recipient splenic DCs without triggering their activation, and they
deliver donor MHC molecules to host T cells, which induce donor
specific T-cell tolerance in recipients. In this study, we found that
total splenocytes and splenic T cells from imDex/rapamycin￾cotreated recipients showed a significant decrease in proliferation
and activation response against donor splenocytes. These data
suggest that combined treatment with donor imDex and
rapamycin inhibits T-cell activation and may induce anergy of
alloreactive T cells for donor antigen.
We also observed that the combination of imDex and
rapamycin notably increased the percentage of CD4+
CD25+ T
cells and up-regulated Foxp3 expression in recipient splenic T
cells. Furthermore, we found that the tolerance in imDex/
rapamycin-cotreated recipients could be transferred to naı¨ve
syngenetic mice by injecting the recipients’ splenocytes but not
serum. These results suggest that the tolerance may be mediated
by immunoregulatory cells of recipients. But on the other hand, we
did not confirm whether these CD4+
CD25+ T cells are Treg cells
or not. We didn’t analyze their alloantigen-specificity and
regulatory functions experimentally either. Because of this, we
cannot confirm the immune tolerance we induced are directly
related to the CD4+
CD25+
Foxp3+ Treg cells. However, only a few
studies have focused on the effect of exosomes on Treg cells. Wang
et al. reported that exosomes derived from thymus can induce Treg
cell proliferation in vivo [30]. Cai et al. described utilizing
exosomes that were derived from TGF-b1 gene-modified BM￾DCs to induce Foxp3+ Treg cells and decrease the proportion of
Th17 cells in a mouse model of inflammatory bowel disease [31].
In the future, we will do more study on the number, phenotype
and function of splenic CD4+
CD25+ T cells in the tolerant
recipients to find the relation between these cells and Treg cells.
Taken together, our study demonstrates that the combination of
donor imDex and low-dose rapamycin treatment can induce
donor specific immune tolerance in a murine heterotopic cardiac
transplantation model and prolong allograft survival. The
tolerance can persist long term and be transferred to naı¨ve
syngenetic recipients by injecting tolerific immunocytes. Our study
reports a novel therapeutic approach for inducing transplant
immune tolerance, but mechanisms such as inter-regulation
among imDex, DCs, and Treg cells should be examined in future
studies.
Materials and Methods
Ethnics Statements
All animals experiments were performed in accordance with a
guideline from the Administration of Animal Experiments for
Medical Research Purposes issued by the Ministry of Health of
China. The protocol was approved by the Animal Experiment
Administration Committee of Fourth Military Medical University.
All surgery was performed under sodium pentobarbital anesthesia
and accomplished in a clean surgery room with sterilized
instruments. All efforts were made to minimize the suffering of
the mice during the experiments.
Mice
Six- to twelve- week-old male C57BL/6 (H-2b), male BALB/c
(H-2d) and male CBA/H (H-2k) mice were obtained from the
Experimental Animal Center of The Fourth Military Medical
University and housed in specific pathogen-free conditions.
Antibodies
The monoclonal antibodies used for cytofluorometric analysis
were fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated anti-MHC
class I, anti-MHC class II, anti-CD80, anti-CD86, anti-CD4,
anti-CD69 were purchased from Bioscience (San Diego, CA,
USA), and FITC-conjugated anti-CD11c, FITC-conjugated anti￾NLDC-145, and phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated anti-CD25 were
purchased from Abcam (Cambridge, UK). The corresponding
isotype antibodies were control. Western blotting utilized mono￾clonal antibodies (all from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz,
CA) against HSP70, HSP90, ICAM-1, MFG-E8, and Foxp3;
horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibodies
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used.
Cultivation of BMDCs in vitro
DCs were generated from BM progenitor cells as described by
Muthana et al. [32]. In brief, BM cells were collected from femurs
and tibias of mice. To remove the adherent macrophages, the BM
cells then were cultured for 24 h in complete RPMI 1640 medium
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) supplemented with 10%
endotoxin-free fetal bovine serum (Gibco, Carlsbad, CA, USA)
that had been centrifuged (110,0006g overnight) to deplete
contaminating vesicles and protein aggregates. The non-adherent
cells were culture for 8 d in fresh complete medium containing
recombinant mouse GM-CSF and IL-4 (10 ng/mL, Peprotech,
Rocky Hill, NJ). The cells and supernatant of culture medium
were harvested. Then, part of the harvested cells were re-cultured
in fresh complete medium containing LPS (10 mg/mL, Sigma, St.
Louis, M.O.) for 48 h, and the cells and supernatant were also
harvested.

Exosomes Preparation
Exosomes were purified from the culture supernatant of mDCs
and imDCs by ultrafiltration and ultracentrifugation as described
by Lamparski et al. [17]. In brief, the supernatants were first
centrifuged at 3006g for 10 min and then at 1,2006g for 30 min,
each at 4uC. The clarified supernatant was concentrated by
centrifugation for 30 min at 4,0006g, at 4uC, in a pre-rinsed
Centricon Plus-80 capsule filter (MW 100 KDa, Millipore,
Danvers, MA). The ultrafiltrate was underlayed with 30%
sucrose/D2O density cushion, followed by ultracentrifugation at
110,0006g and 4uC for 1 h. The cushion was collected and
diluted in Dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS), and then
concentrated by centrifugation for 30 min at 4,0006g at 4uC in a
pre-rinsed 100 KDa MWCO Millipore Centricon Plus-80 capsule
filter. The protein amounts were quantified by Bradford assay
(Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA).
Electron Microscopy
The sample of exosomes was loaded onto a copper grid at room
temperature. After the exosomes precipitated for 3 min, the
sample liquid was sucked up slowly with filter paper from the side
of the copper mesh. The sample was then counterstainded with
2% phosphotungstic acid solution (30 mL, pH 6.8) for 10 min at
room temperature. The sample liquid was sucked up again, and
the sample was placed under an incandescent lamp for 5 min.
Finally, the exosomes sample was examined with a CM20 Twin
Philips electron microscope (Phillips Electronic Instruments,
Mahway, NJ).
Flow Cytometry
The two kinds of DCs were harvested, washed, and resuspended
in PBS, 1% bovine serum albumin, 5% heat-inactivated normal
rabbit serum, and 0.1% sodium azide. Cells were incubated for
45 min at 4uC with FITC-conjugated anti-MHC class I, anti￾MHC class II, anti-CD80, anti-CD86, anti-CD11c, or anti￾NLDC-145. The two kinds of exosomes were incubated with
aldehyde/sulfate latex beads (Interfacial Dynamics, Portland, OR,
USA) at 4uC overnight. The reaction was stopped with 100 mM
glycine for 30 min. The beads were washed three times in flow
buffer (3% fetal bovine serum in PBS) and stained with FITC￾conjugated anti-MHC class I, anti-MHC class II, anti-CD80, or
anti-CD86. The beads and cells were analyzed by flow cytometry
using a FACSCalibur (BD Immunocytometry Systems, Franklin
Lakes, NJ, USA).
Western Blotting
Proteins (10 mg) from the two kinds of exosomes were separated
by 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred onto PVDF membranes (Milli￾pore, USA). After blocking with 5% nonfat dry milk in PBS, the
membrane was incubated with anti-HSP70, anti-HSP90, anti￾ICAM-1, and anti-MFG-E8 followed by HRP-conjugated sec￾ondary antibodies and detected by enhanced chemiluminescence
using X-ray films.
Transplantation
Celiac heart transplants were performed using a modified
technique as described by Niimi [33]. C57BL/6 mice served as
heart donors and BALB/c mice as allograft recipients. After the
donor mice were anesthetized, the inferior vena cava, azygos vein,
superior vena cava, ascending artery and pulmonary artery were
ligated with 7-0 silk sutures and cut in order. An end-to-side
anastomosis was performed with 10-0 surgical sutures between the
donor ascending artery with the recipient abdominal artery and
between the donor pulmonary artery with the recipient inferior
vena cava. Cervical heterotopic heart transplants were performed
according to the Chen technique [34]. The donor ascending artery
was sutured end-to-side to the recipient right common carotid
artery, and the donor pulmonary artery was anastomosed to the
recipient right external jugular vein. Cardiac graft function was
tested daily by transabdominal palpation. Rejection was defined as
a complete cessation of palpable beating. Cardiac allografts that
stopped beating within 2 d were regarded as technical failures and
excluded from further analysis.
In vitro T-Cell Stimulation Assay
Five or ten days after transplantation, total splenocytes of
recipient BABL/c mice were sterilely extracted, and T cells were
isolated from the splenocytes using nylon wool columns (Fenwall
Laboratories, Lake Zurich, IL, USA); the two kind of cells were
responder cells. Responder cells (56104
) were seeded into 96-well
round-bottom plates (Costar, Santa Fe Springs, CA, USA) with
stimulatory cells that were donor (C57BL/6) or third-party (CBA/
H) splenocytes treated with mitomycin C 24 h. [3
H]-thymidine
(1 mCi/well) was added 72 h later for 18 h, and [3
H]-thymidine
incorporation was countered by liquid scintillation. Additionally,
the T cells were harvested after co-cultured with stimulatory cells
and stained with anti-CD69. T cells were then analyzed by flow
cytometry.
recipient. Paraffin sections were stained with hematoxylin-eosin and observed by optical microscope. Representative allografts of untreated
recipients (B and C), allografts of imDex/rapamycin-cotreated recipients (D and E), and control specimens from syngenetic transplantation recipients
(F and G) are shown.

Spleen CD4+
CD25+ T Cells and Foxp3 Protein
Quantification
Five or ten days after transplantation, splenic T cells were
purified from recipient mice and stained with FITC-conjugated
anti-CD4 and PE-conjugated anti-CD25, and then analyzed by
flow cytometry. Foxp3 protein of splenic T cells was measured by
western blotting.
Assessment of Histological and Morphometric Changes
Seven days after transplantation, specimens of cardiac allografts
from different recipients were obtained and fixed with parafor￾maldehyde and then embedded in paraffin. Sections (5 mm) were
stained with hematoxylin-eosin to assess morphological changes.
Transplantation of a syngenetic heart (BALB/c to BALB/c) was
used as a control.
Statistics Analysis
One-way analysis of variance was used for analysis within
groups. The Kaplan and Meier method was used to calculate the
survival curves, and the log-rank test was used to compare animal
survival in different groups of mice using SPSS for Windows 17.0
software. P,0.05 was considered significant.
