After years of initial aggressive surgical intervention and
a subsequent shift to damage control surgery (DCS),
non operative management (NOM) has been shown to
be safe and effective.
In fact trauma surgeons realized that in liver trauma,
it was safer to pack livers [1] than do finger fracture [2]
or resection, and this represented a tangential issue to
nonoperative approach.
Damage control was not the paradigm shift for spleen
and liver, but rather to address coagulopathy that was
more commonly associated with penetrating major
abdominal vascular injuries [3].
The shift to nonoperative care was largely motivated
by intraoperative observations that many minor liver [4]
and splenic injuries [5] were found no longer bleeding.
Then CT arrived in the early 1980s and confirmed
that many moderate liver and spleen injuries did not
require OR intervention. Pediatric surgeons first lead
the shift to nonoperative management for splenic
trauma [6,7].
In the 90’s it became the gold standard for liver injuries
in hemodynamically stable patients, regardless of injury
grade and degree of hemoperitoneum [8], allowing better
outcomes with fewer complications and lesser transfu￾sions [9]. Nevertheless concerns have been raised regard￾ing continuous monitoring required [10], safety in higher
grades of injury [11] and general applicability of NOM to
all haemodynamically stable patients [12]. Similarly, in
the same period and following promising results obtained
with splenic salvage [13] with several surgical techniques
[14] such as splenorraphy, high intensity ultrasound, hae￾mostatic wraps and staplers [15], NOM became the treat￾ment of choice for blunt splenic injuries [5]. However it
was immediately clear that NOM failure in adults was
significantly higher than that observed in children (17%
vs 2%). The incidence of immune system sequelae,
coupled with Overwhelming Post Surgical Infection
(OPSI) and their real clinical impact, is difficult to estab￾lish in the overall population including children [16].
Although recent reports [17] showed that despite a simi￾lar incidence and severity of solid organ injuries, Trauma
centers with higher risk-adjusted mortality rates are more
likely to undertake operative interventions for solid organ
injuries. Data from The American College of Surgeons’
National Trauma Data Bank including 87,237 solid
abdominal organ injuries showed that, despite a strongly
significant increase in percentage of NOM for hepatic and
splenic trauma, mortality has remained unchanged [18].
More recently several authors have highlighted an exces￾sive use of NOM, which for some high grade liver injuries
is pushed far beyond the reasonable limits, carrying
increased morbidity at short and long term, such as bilo￾mas, biliary fistulae, early or late haemorrhage, false aneur￾ysm, arteriovenous fistulae, haemobilia, liver abscess, and
liver necrosis [19]. Incidence of complications attributed
to NOM increases in concert with the grade of injury. In a
series of 337 patients with liver injury grades III-V treated
non-operatively, those with grade III had a complication
rate of 1%, grade IV 21%, and grade V 63% [20]. Patients
with grades IV and V injuries are more likely to require
operation, and to have complications of non-operative
treatment. Therefore, although it is not essential to per￾form liver resection at the first laparotomy, if bleeding has
been effectively controlled [21], increasing evidence sug￾gests that liver resection should be considered as a surgical
option in patients with complex liver injury, as an initial or
delayed strategy, which can be accomplished with low
mortality and liver related morbidity in experienced hands
[22].
Liver resection in hepatic trauma should be considered
when (1) massive bleeding related to a hepatic venous
injury, (2) massive destruction and devitalized hepatic tis￾sue is present, often partially resected by the injury itself,

or (3) a major bile leak coming from a proximal, main
intrahepatic biliary duct are found.
NOM of liver injuries grade > = 3, especially when
treated with combined AngioEmbolization (AE), is not
without risks (mainly biliary leaks, liver necrosis and
severe sepsis) and may lead to significant morbidity and
possible mortality in up to 11% of cases due to liver￾related complications [23].
Although AE has been defined the logical augmentation
of damage control techniques for controlling hemorrhage,
the overall liver-related complication rate can be as high
as 60.6% with 42.2% incidence of Major Hepatic Necrosis
[24]. Early liver lobectomy in such cases required lesser
number of procedures and achieved lower complication
rate and lower mortality compared to less aggressive
approaches such as serial operative debridements and/or
percutaneous drainage [25].
Further concerns for both liver and spleen NOM, arise
when associated hepatic and splenic injuries coexist and/
or potentially missed injuries can be suspected. Patients
with associated liver and spleen injuries are twice as likely
to fail non-operative therapy as those with only a single
organ injured [26]. Missing associated intra-abdominal
injury and delayed treatment, significantly affects the out￾come. This occurs more often in conjunction with liver
than with splenic injury, especially pancreas and bowel
injury are significantly associated with liver injury in blunt
trauma [27].
NOM is actually used blunt splenic as the initial stan￾dard of care for blunt splenic injuries, not only in children
(rates above 90-95%) but also in adults (60-77% [28]).
Even in Grade IV-V splenic injuries NOM attempt has
been pushed up to in 40.5% but it ultimately failed in 55%
of these high-grade injuries [29]. This is despite the fact
that, already in the late 90’s, it became clear that signifi￾cant numbers of delayed splenic complications occurred
with nonoperative management of splenic injuries which
were potentially life-threatening [30].
A significantly higher failure rate (38%) has been
observed in grade IV-V Blunt Splenic injury(BSI) patients
and above all, mortality of patients for whom NOM failed
was almost 7-fold higher than those with successful NOM
in this series (4.7% vs 0.7%; p = .07) [31]. Furthermore,
multivariate analysis identified 2 independent predictors of
f-NOM: grade V BSI and the presence of a brain injury.
Other authors identified age > 55 years, ISS > 25 and
lower level trauma centers admission as predictors of sple￾nic NOM failure [32]. That means NOM should be care￾fully initiated in severe grade of BSI and careful selection
of candidates for NOM is advisable for a safe conservative
management choice.
In the most recent years a liberal and more aggressive
use of angiography has often been observed and is asso￾ciated with higher rates of NOM (80%) and lower rates of
failure (2-5%); nonetheless several concerns raise because
it is labour intensive and there have been several reports
reporting a surprisingly high rate of complications [33]. In
WTA multi-institutional experience, among 140 patients
underwent AE, 27 (20%) suffered major complications
including 16 (11%) failure to control bleeding (requiring 9
splenectomies and 7 repeat AE), 4 (3%) missed injuries, 6
(4%) splenic abscesses, and 1 iatrogenic vascular injury
[34]. Additionally, proximal splenic artery embolization
(SAE), has been introduced in an attempt to increase over￾all success rates of NOM in high grade BSI, but the follow￾ing has been observed: (1) high failure rates of proximal
SAE in all patients with grade V injuries and the majority
of grade IV injuries, (2) the immunologic consequences of
proximal SAE are unclear, and whether its use provides
true salvage of splenic function versus simple avoidance of
operative splenectomy, (3) an increased incidence of Adult
Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). This was 4-fold
higher in those patients that underwent proximal SAE
compared with those that underwent operative splenect￾omy (22% vs. 5%, p = 0.002). Higher rates of septic compli￾cations including splenic abscess, septicemia, and
pneumonia have also been recorded, and lastly (4) a non
significant trend to higher amount of PRBC (packed red
blood cell) transfusions, higher mortality and longer
Length Of Stay [35].
Splenic preservation can also have deleterious side
effects in otherwise salvageable patients. A review of 78
patients who failed NOM revealed a mortality rate of
12.6%. The authors concluded that the majority of their
deaths were a result of delayed treatment of intra-abdom￾inal injuries, and suggested that 70% of deaths after failing
NOM were potentially preventable [36]. When extrapo￾lated to a large series like the EAST trial, this means that
33 unnecessary deaths occurred or 0.5% of all patients
treated non-operatively. Compared to a death rate from
OPSI of 1/10,000 adult splenectomised patients, the odds
are 20 times greater that a patient would die from failure
of NOMSI than from OPSI [37].
Thus we surgeons must keep in our minds that post￾splenectomy sepsis is rare and can be minimized with
polyvalent vaccines of encapsulated bacteria, whilst opera￾tive mortality of splenectomy in the otherwise normal
patient is < 1% [38].
Whereas Non Operative Management of Liver Injury
(NOMLI) has not been shown to increase mortality
rates for those that fail, the same cannot be said for the
NOMSI and the balance between concerns with bleed￾ing and infection has in the most recent years shifted
illogically to favour infection. As Richardson highlighted,
it should be made clear that these delayed bleeding and
late failures of NOM are not harmful. “Anecdotally, I
have been impressed in private discussions about deaths
or “near misses” from bleeding occurring in NOM

failures. These are rarely reported in the literature.
Additionally, many reports list multiple organ failure as
a leading cause of death. Does unrecognized shock play
a role in these deaths?” [39].
In conclusion, at the beginning of the 21st century,
when NOM for liver and spleen injuries is often advo￾cated beyond the limits of a reasonable safety and the
need for surgery is considered as a defeat or “failure”.
We should not forget in making the best treatment
choice, to keep in mind not only the predictors of NOM
failure, such as the injury grade, the presence of asso￾ciated intra-abdominal injuries and the risk of missing
injuries with the subsequent sequelae, of a failed NOM
and of delayed surgical treatment, but we must also
consider the potential drawbacks of angioembolization,
the environmental setting and factors, i.e. the level of
the hospital (trauma center), availability of Angio Suite
and ICU for continuous monitoring, the initiation of
NOM during night shift, the need of an eventual time
consuming spine surgery in a prone position for a con￾comitant vertebral fracture, and last but not least, the
time needed for complete and safe resumption of nor￾mal life (work and physical activity).
