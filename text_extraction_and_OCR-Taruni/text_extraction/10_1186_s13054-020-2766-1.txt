Abstract
Background: Candidemia is an opportunistic infection associated with high morbidity and mortality in patients
hospitalized both inside and outside intensive care units (ICUs). Identification of patients at risk is crucial to ensure
prompt antifungal therapy. We sought to assess risk factors for candidemia and death, both outside and inside
ICUs.
Methods: This prospective multicenter matched case-control study involved six teaching hospitals in Switzerland
and France. Cases were defined by positive blood cultures for Candida sp. Controls were matched to cases using
the following criteria: age, hospitalization ward, hospitalization duration, and, when applicable, type of surgery. One
to three controls were enrolled by case. Risk factors were analyzed by univariate and multivariate conditional
regression models, as a basis for a new scoring system to predict candidemia.
Results: One hundred ninety-two candidemic patients and 411 matched controls were included. Forty-four percent
of included patients were hospitalized in ICUs, and 56% were hospitalized outside ICUs. Independent risk factors for
candidemia in the ICU population included total parenteral nutrition, acute kidney injury, heart disease, prior septic
shock, and exposure to aminoglycoside antibiotics. Independent risk factors for candidemia in the non-ICU
population included central venous catheter, total parenteral nutrition, and exposure to glycopeptides and
nitroimidazoles. The accuracy of the scores based on these risk factors is better in the ICU than in the non-ICU
population. Independent risk factors for death in candidemic patients included septic shock, acute kidney injury,
and the number of antibiotics to which patients were exposed before candidemia.
Discussion: While this study shows a role for known and novel risk factors for candidemia, it specifically highlights
important differences in their distribution according to the hospital setting (ICU versus non-ICU).
Conclusion: This study provides novel risk scores for candidemia accounting for the hospital setting and recent
progress in patients’ management strategies and fungal epidemiology.

Take home message
The epidemiology of candidemia is changing with the
constant evolution of medical and surgical care. In this
study, we show that the risk of candidemia depends on
exposure to different antibiotics and/or medical proce￾dures in ICU and non-ICU patients, highlighting the
need for setting-specific risk assessment scores.
Introduction
Candida spp. are the third most common microorgan￾isms responsible for health-care-related bloodstream in￾fections [1]. The incidence of candidemia has increased
by 50% over the last decade worldwide and ranges be￾tween 2.4/100000 and ~ 15/100000 individuals, depend￾ing on the country and clinical setting [2–6]. Despite
significant progress in antifungal treatment options, can￾didemia is still associated with an overall crude mortality
rate ranging between 40 and 60% [4, 7–11]. Attributable
mortality ranges from 5% to 49% [12–14], depending on
the control group considered and the underlying comor￾bidities, the impact of nosocomial infections being
known to be greater in less sick population, and so prob￾ably less important in ICU patients [15]. Prompt initi￾ation of appropriate antifungal therapy is crucial to
improve the chances of survival [16]. However, blood
cultures for yeasts lack sensitivity and need prolonged
incubation (> 24 h). As a consequence, antifungal drugs
are often prescribed either prophylactically, pre￾emptively, or empirically in high-risk patients [17]. The
resulting overuse of antifungal drugs may lead to the
emergence of Candida species that are resistant to
azoles and/or echinocandins [5, 18–20].
Few studies used a matched case-control design to as￾sess risk factors for candidemia [21–25]. Unmatched
studies identified factors such as a central venous cath￾eter (CVC), prior surgery, broad-spectrum antibiotic
therapy, or total parenteral nutrition (TPN) which are
present in a large number of hospitalized patients [22,
23, 26–28]. Furthermore, most studies were performed
either inside or outside intensive care units (ICUs) and a
few of them allowed for differential analyses according
to both settings [24]. This prospective, multicenter,
matched case-control study aims to assess the risk fac￾tors associated with candidemia in high-risk groups of
patients in both the ICU and non-ICU settings.
Materials and methods
Study design and patients
This multicenter, international, prospective, matched
case-control study was carried out in five university hos￾pitals (Lille, France; Lausanne, Geneva, Bern, and Basel,
Switzerland) and a large teaching hospital (St. Gallen,
Switzerland) contributing to the Fungal Infection Net￾work of Switzerland (FUNGINOS)—and ALLFUN
networks between July 2013 and March 2017. Patients
were included if they were > 18 years old with at least
one blood culture positive for Candida spp. Matched
controls (up to three per case) were selected by local in￾vestigators for each case. Matching criteria included age
(+/− 5 years), hospital ward, duration of hospital stay
(time from hospital admission to candidemia in each
case was matched to a length of hospitalization at least
equal for the corresponding control; most controls
remained hospitalized after their inclusion, they were
followed-up to ensure that they did not develop candide￾mia), and the type of surgery in case of surgical proced￾ure. Patients with a history of intravenous drug abuse
were excluded from the study as they usually have a
clinical risk profile that is different from other candi￾demic patients.
Laboratory tests
Two automated blood culture systems were used during
the study period: Bactec™ (Becton Dickinson, Sparks,
Maryland, USA) and Bact/Alert®3D (bioMérieux, Marcy
l’Etoile, France). Yeasts isolated from blood cultures
were identified by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry
(Microflex Mass Spectrometer, Bruker Daltonics GmbH,
Bremen, Germany) as described previously [29]. Isolates
with MALDI-TOF score less than 1.7 were subsequently
identified by molecular methods, as reported previously
[30].
Data collection and definitions
Demographic characteristics and underlying medical
conditions were recorded systematically for each case
and matched controls in a secured electronic case report
form (eCRF). Corticosteroid use was defined by the use
of > 20 mg prednisone-equivalent daily for > 10 days be￾fore positive blood cultures. Clinical conditions and risk
factors within 2 weeks prior to candidemia (or a
matched time in controls) were also recorded, including
the presence of intravenous and urinary devices, TPN,
mechanical ventilation (for > 24 h), renal replacement
therapy, and use of gastric acid secretion inhibitors. The
use of antibacterial and antifungal drugs within 4 weeks
before candidemia (or equivalent time in controls) was
also recorded. Whenever available, Candida colonization
index and Candida score were recorded by using the
method described by Pittet et al. [31] and Léon et al.
[22, 27]. We defined ICU population as patients hospi￾talized in ICU at the time of candidemia and conversely
for non-ICU population.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were performed using the Stata soft￾ware (v15.1; College Station, TX, USA). Factors associ￾ated with candidemia and mortality were analyzed by
Poissy et al. Critical Care (2020) 24:109 Page 2 of 11

using univariate and multivariate conditional logistic re￾gression models. A backward stepwise logistic regression
was used to select variables entered in the multivariate
models, using a cutoff p value of 0.10. New scores to
predict the risk of candidemia were developed for pa￾tients in and outside the ICU. Scores were obtained by
rounding the β-coefficients. Receiving operating charac￾teristic (ROC) curves were drawn using rocreg imple￾mented in Stata®, after adjustment for matching
covariates [32]. Test efficiencies were calculated using
the dtroc softwares (Stata®). The best cutoff point was
established according to standard methods (Youdden’s
approach to determine the cutoff with the best com￾promise between sensitivity and specificity; the method
of Zweig and Campbell, maximizing efficiency) [33, 34]
by using cutpt (Stata®).
Results
Study population
The study included 192 patients with candidemia and
411 controls matched for age, hospital duration stay,
ward, and type of surgery in case of surgery. Patients
were almost equally distributed between surgical (56%)
and medical wards (44%) and between non-ICU (53%)
and ICU (47%). Median age was 63 years [52–74] and
approximately two-thirds of patients were male. Candi￾demia occurred within a median duration of 16 days
(interquartile range 5–27) after hospital admission. Can￾dida albicans was the most commonly reported species
(61%), followed by Candida glabrata (16%), Candida
parapsilosis (9%), Candida tropicalis (3%), Candida kru￾sei (3%), and other/mixed species (8%).
Risk factors for candidemia
Univariate and multivariate analyses of risk factors for
candidemia according to hospital setting are shown in
Table 1 and in Table 2, respectively. Independent risk
factors for candidemia in the whole population included
central venous catheter (OR = 6.74, 95% confidence
interval (CI) 2.96–15.4, p < 0.001), TPN (OR = 3.92,
95%CI 2.28–6.73, p < 0.001), previous septic shock (OR =
2.29, 95%CI 1.33–3.96, p = 0.003), exposure to nitroimi￾dazoles (OR = 2.16, 95%CI 1.11–4.21), and renal replace￾ment therapy (OR = 2.16, 95%CI 1.11–4.21, p = 0.02).
Independent risk factors for candidemia within the
ICU population included TPN (OR = 6.75, 95%CI 2.89–
15.7, p < 0.001), acute kidney injury (OR = 4.77, 95%CI
1.94–11.8, p < 0.001), heart disease (OR = 3.78, 95%CI
1.09–13.1, p = 0.006), previous septic shock (OR = 2.39,
95%CI 1.14–5.01, p = 0.02), and exposure to aminoglyco￾sides (OR = 2.28, 95%CI 1.01–5.13, p = 0.05).
Independent risk factors for candidemia within the
non-ICU population included CVC (OR = 9.77, 95%CI
3.72–25.7, p < 0.001), TPN (OR = 3.29, 95%CI 1.52–7.13,
p = 0.003), exposure to glycopeptides (OR = 3.31, 95%CI
1.33–8.23, p = 0.04), and to nitroimidazoles (OR = 3.12,
95%CI 1.07–9.11, p = 0.04).
Predictive scores for candidemia based on the afore￾mentioned risk factors were developed for both ICU and
non-ICU patients (Fig. 1, panel A1 and A2, respectively).
The area under the curve (AUC) was 0.768 for ICU pa￾tients and 0.717 for non-ICU patients. The optimal cut￾off value for the best compromise between sensitivity
and specificity was ≥ 4 for ICU patients (sensitivity =
69%, and specificity = 70%) and ≥ 2 for non-ICU patients
(sensitivity = 83% and specificity = 49%). Considering a
method maximizing efficiency, the optimal cutoff for a
better specificity was ≥ 5 for ICU patients (sensitivity =
43%, specificity = 88%) and ≥ 4 for non-ICU patients
(sensitivity = 51% and specificity = 81%).
Risk factors of mortality
Univariate and multivariate analysis of risk factors for
death in candidemic patients according to hospital set￾ting are shown in Table 3 and in Table 4, respectively.
Independent risk factors for death in the whole popula￾tion included septic shock (OR = 6.80, 95%CI 2.93–15.8,
p < 0.001), acute kidney injury (OR = 5.62, 95%CI 2.44–
12.9, p < 0.001), and the number of antibiotics (OR =
1.43, 95%CI 1.16–1.77 per unit, p < 0.001). Age tended
to be associated with death (p = 0.06). Independent risk
factors for death in ICU patients included septic shock
(OR = 4.09, 95%CI 1.72–14.0, p = 0.003), acute kidney in￾jury (OR = 3.45, 95%CI 1.21–9.90, p = 0.02), and the
number of antibiotics to which patients were exposed
before candidemia (OR = 1.37, 95%CI 1.06–1.75 per unit,
p = 0.02). Independent risk factors for death in non-ICU
patients included acute kidney injury (OR = 11.9, 95%CI
2.47–57.7, p = 0.002) and septic shock (OR = 8.70, 95%CI
2.26–33.5, p = 0.002).
Discussion
This prospective, multicenter, matched case-control
study was designed to analyze risk factors for candide￾mia in both ICU and non-ICU patients. The study in￾cluded the largest number of candidemic patients
reported from a case-control study in the ICU [25] and
the second largest sample size for a case-control study
outside the ICU [21]. Different risk factors for candide￾mia were identified in both settings, allowing for tar￾geted risk factor selection.
Because invasive candidiasis is a rare clinical event,
previous studies have included cases irrespective of the
presence or absence of candidemia [22–24, 27]. Non￾candidemic patients can represent up to 30% of cases in
some studies [22, 24]. The term “invasive candidiasis” is
applied to very differently defined clinical conditions.
Some of these, such as post-surgical intra-abdominal

candidiasis, require a complex diagnostic approach with
clinical and microbiological expertise [35], while others,
such as candidemia, represent a clear-cut phenotype. In
order to maximize case homogeneity and minimize the
risk for misclassification, we considered only patients
with candidemia in the present study. Furthermore, we
used a matched case-control design, with matching cri￾teria similar to those used in the seminal paper by Wey
et al. [25], adding a more stringent matching for the type
of surgery. A novelty of the present study is the applica￾tion of a matched case-control design in ICU patients.
The matching criteria aimed at separating risk factors
that are specific for candidemia from those that result
from prolonged hospitalization [25].
Overall, the study confirms the well-established risk fac￾tors for candidemia, such as total parenteral nutrition (the
most robust one, which was identified in all studies [10,
21–25, 27]), central venous catheter [10, 23–25, 28], septic

25], as well previous exposure to antibiotics (without class
specification) [21, 23–25]. The study also highlights the
specific risk factors for candidemia that emerge for the
ICU and the non-ICU settings, as illustrated by specific
patterns of antibiotic exposure, as well as clinical features
or medical equipment. For instance, CVC was an
independent risk factor for candidemia outside the ICU,
probably reflecting its very frequent use (> 90% of patients)
in ICU, making it non-discriminant for the determination
of the risk of candidemia this setting [22]. In contrast, sep￾tic shock was associated with candidemia solely inside the
ICU, in accordance with the two studies by Léon et al. [22,
27], reflecting the fact that most patients with such

complication are managed in this setting. The other clinical
features associated with candidemia solely among ICU pa￾tients included heart failure and kidney injury which not
previously reported in this setting.
One of the most striking findings of this study was the
different patterns of antibiotic exposure associated with
candidemia in ICU and non-ICU patients. Glycopeptides
and nitroimidazoles were associated with candidemia
only outside the ICU. The frequent use of these drugs in
the ICU may explain the lack of association in this spe￾cific setting. This finding is consistent with a recent
study in patients on internal medicine wards, in which
glycopeptides were found to be an independent risk fac￾tor for candidemia [21]. As intraabdominal bacterial in￾fections were associated with candidemia in the ICU
population in univariate analysis (but not in multivariate
one), we have forced this variable in the multivariate
models for the whole population and the non-ICU one
to check for bias. The association between candidemia
and glycopeptides/nitroimidazoles remains significant so
that these classes of antibiotics can be considered as in￾dependent from intraabdominal bacterial infections. In
contrast, aminoglycosides were an independent risk fac￾tor for candidemia solely in the ICU. These drugs may
represent a supplementary risk factor for developing
candidemia among ICU patients, who are exposed to
multiple other classes of antibiotics (including drugs ac￾tive against Gram-negative anaerobic bacteria) and/or to
glycopeptide antibiotics. Because control matching was
performed on a center basis, the associations with antibi￾otics are not likely to reflect any differences in center’s
antibiotic stewardship or empirical treatment strategies.
Candida colonization was previously reported as a risk
factor for candidemia in some studies [22, 25, 27], but
not in others [21, 23, 24]. Colonization was not system￾atically tested in all patients, thereby limiting the statis￾tical power to detect an association with candidemia.
The different practices to monitor Candida colonization
among centers due to logistic and financial issues may
limit its universal use to assess the risk of candidemia. On
the other hand, Candida colonization, if systematically
monitored over time during prolonged hospitalization,
may become too frequent to be a discriminant predictor
[36]. Corticosteroids and other immunosuppressive drugs
were not associated with candidemia in the present study,
neither in ICU nor in non-ICU patients. Corticosteroids
were inconstantly associated with candidemia in previous
studies, possibly due to the lack of standard definitions for

high-risk corticosteroid dose and duration of exposure
[21–24].
Both the non-ICU and ICU predictive scores for can￾didemia in this study can be used with relative low cut￾off values. The high negative-predictive values associated
with low cutoffs can be useful to identify patients in
whom the occurrence of candidemia is unlikely, thereby
avoiding the use of unnecessary antifungal prophylaxis
or empirical/pre-emptive therapy [22, 27]. Alternatively,
high positive-predictive values associated with higher
cutoffs are applied in other studies for selecting patients
who might benefit from empirical/pre-emptive antifun￾gal therapy [21, 23]. In our study, the accuracy and the
compromise between sensitivity and specificity is better
for the ICU score than for the non-ICU score. The score
in the ICU setting could be used both to exclude candi￾demia (low cutoff) or to detect candidemic patients (high
cutoff). The scores should be validated and evaluated in
a validation cohort.
This study extends the list of risk factors for candide￾mia that exert a strong influence on the intestinal micro￾biota. The gut is the most frequent portal of entry for
invasive infection due to Candida spp. [37], as a key locus
for host-pathogen interactions [38] and a major determin￾ant for the transition from colonization to infection [39]. In
mice models, TPN and subsequent enteral deprivation lead
to important modifications in the gut microbiota (with a
shift of the predominance of Gram-positive Firmicutes to
Gram-negative Proteobacteria), alteration in the barrier
function of epithelial cells [40], and intestinal inflammation
[40, 41]. In mice, antibiotic administration is increasingly
shown to exert important and long-lasting alterations on
the gut microbiota, which can induce proliferation of
pathogenic microorganisms [42]. Administration of drugs
such as carbapenems [43], fluoroquinolones [44], and gly￾copeptides [45], this last one being recognized as independ￾ent risk factors for candidemia in the present study, has
been associated with increased Candida gut colonization
in mice, as a probable result of altered relative proportions
of anaerobic and aerobic bacteria in the microbiome.
The results from this study are strengthened by a large
sample size, with the largest collection of candidemia
cases from ICU in a case-control study today and a pro￾spective case-control study design. Yet, control matching
implies the use of conditional regression models, which
limits statistical power. Furthermore, the number of con￾trols per case is smaller than in a cohort study, thereby
limiting predictive score performance. The ICU setting
and surgery were used as matching criteria and thus
were not assessable as risk factor in this study. While
our study suggests that risk assessment and scoring need
to account for the hospital setting (ICU versus non￾ICU), larger studies allowing for scores in even more
specific groups of patients (such as medical, surgical,
onco-hematological patients) would further improve risk
prediction.
Conclusion
We show that risk factors for candidemia are different
among patients hospitalized inside and outside ICUs.
Specific patterns of antibiotic exposure are emerging as
novel risk factors for candidemia. These include amino￾glycosides for patients hospitalized within the ICU and
glycopeptides and nitroimidazoles for patients hospital￾ized outside the ICU. Weighted scores predictive of can￾didemia can be built based on these risks. An improved
prediction of the risk of candidemia may contribute to
guide targeted preventive and therapeutic antifungal
strategies.
