Conservative treatment of perforation following
balloon dilation of the papilla after sphincterotomy
In the past 2 years, we have carried out 152
consecutive cases of large balloon dilation
of the papilla after full length sphincterot￾omy in our center. The procedure was
undertaken in patients with normal struc￾tural anatomy and large (> 12mm),
unretrieved biliary duct stones, using bal￾loon catheters (CRE Esophageal/Pyloric,
maximum diameter 15, 18, or 20mm;
length 5 cm, Boston Scientific, Natick,
Massachusetts, USA). We experienced
three cases of perforation (2 %) related to
balloon dilation during this period. All
three cases involved middle-aged women
hospitalized for choledocholithiasis.
The first perforation was discovered on
cholangiography performed immediately
after the dilation, which showed leakage
of the fluorescent contrast medium
around the duodenal wall (●" Fig. 1). A
plastic stent was immediately placed to
contain the leaking bile and the patient
sent for urgent computed tomography
(CT). The other two cases manifested
within the first 24–48 hours. There was
no sign of perforation on cholangiography
and the patients remained afebrile and
haemodynamically stable. However, they
complained of a dull abdominal pain in
the epigastrium, and laboratory findings
indicated slightly raised levels of inflam￾matory markers (C-reactive protein and
white blood cell counts). Plain radio￾graphic examination did not suggest pres￾ence of free air and the patients were re￾ferred for CT, which revealed pneumo￾and retroperitoneum with no retroperito￾neal fluid collection in both cases. There
was only a small amount of contrast leak￾age in the first case (●" Fig. 2 and●" Fig. 3).
All three patients were managed conser￾vatively with antibiotics, placement of na￾sogastric tube, and close medical monitor￾ing, and were discharged within 10 days.
There were no medical concerns during
the follow-up period.
To our knowledge, remarkably low rates
of perforation (0.2 %) [1] have been ob￾served worldwide in studies using large
balloon dilation of the papilla after
sphincterotomy in patients with normal
anatomical structures [1–4]. The rare
cases that have been reported until now
were treated conservatively [4, 5]. Of
course, large balloon dilation of the papil￾la after full length sphincterotomy is a
new method, and many related issues are
still under evaluation. However, our data
suggest that perforations may be a more
frequent complication but are not report￾ed as such because they may be subclini￾cal or misdiagnosed. Vigilance on the
part of medical staff, appropriate use of
radiological imaging, and close monitor￾ing may help resolve this difficult judg￾ment call, and spare the patient from
undergoing unnecessary and difficult sur￾gical procedures while preventing serious
and occasionally fatal sepsis.
