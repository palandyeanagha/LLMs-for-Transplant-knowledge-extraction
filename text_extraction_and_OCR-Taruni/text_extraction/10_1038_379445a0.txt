(Dent's disease\ X-linked recessive nephrolithiasis (XRN) 4, 
and X-linked recessive hypophosphataemic rickets (XLRH) 5) 
have been mapped to Xp11.22 (refs 5-7). A microdeletion6 in 
one Dent's disease kindred allowed the identification of a can￾didate gene, CLCNS (refs 8,9) which encodes a putative renal 
chloride channel. Here we report the investigation of 11 kindreds 
with these renal tubular disorders for CLCNS abnormalities; this 
identified three nonsense, four missense and two donor splice site

mutations, together with one intragenic deletion and one micro￾deletion encompassing the entire gene. Heterologous expression 
of wild-type CLCNS in Xenopus oocytes yielded outwardly rectifY￾ing chloride currents, which were either abolished or markedly 
reduced by the mutations. The common aetiology for Dent's 
disease, XRN and XLRH indicates that CLCNS may be involved 
in other renal tubular disorders associated with kidney stones. 
Analysis of CLCN5 reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain 
reaction (RT-PCR) products encompassing the entire 2238-bp 
coding sequence9 from probands of 11 kindreds with Dent's 
disease, XRN and XLRH, revealed different CLCN5 mutations 
(Table 1 and Fig. 1). Each mutation was confirmed and demon￾strated to cosegregate with the disease by using genomic DNA 
together with the appropriate PCR primers and restriction 
enzymes, or by sequence-specific oligonucleotide (SSO) probe 
analysis (Table 1 and Fig. 2). In addition, the absence of these 
CLCN5 abnormalities in 110 alleles from 69 (28 males and 41 
females) unrelated, normal individuals established that they were 
not common polymorphisms. CLCN5 belongs to a family of 
voltage-gated chloride-channel genes ( CLCNJ to CLCN5 and 
CLCN-Ka and Kb), which encode proteins (CLC-1 to CLC-5, 
CLC-Ka and CLC-Kb) that have about 12 transmembrane 
domains 10• These chloride channels are important for the control 
of membrane excitability, transepithelial transport, and possibly 
regulation of cell volume 10• However, mutations have been iden￾tified previously in only CLCNJ, which is expressed in muscle 11 
and is associated with myotonia congenita12- 14• Thus, to assess 
further the functions of CLC-5 and its mutations, we performed 
heterologous expression studies in Xenopus oocytes. Expression of 
the human wild-type (WT) CLC-5 reproducibly yielded strongly 
outwardly rectifying, essentially time-independent currents 
(Fig. 3). Ion substitution experiments indicated that these were 
carried by anions, with a chloride > iodide conductance sequence 
(Fig. 3b,c), as is the case with other chloride channels (CLC-0, 
CLC-1 and CLC-2) of this familyl 2•
15•16• However, these human 
CLC-5 currents, which were indistinguishable from those of rat 
CLC-5 (ref. 17), differed from the others in being strongly out￾wardly rectifying and in being observed only at potentials more 
positive than +10m V. Although positive potentials of even 
+40 m V have been observed in apical membranes of some actively 
transporting epithelia18, we are not aware of renal cells where 
these voltages would be reached in vivo. CLC channels are known 
to function as multimeric complexes, which are most likely to be 
tetramers 12, and it seems possible that CLC-5 forms hetero￾oligomers with as yet unknown subunits in situ that may render 
the channels open at a more physiological voltage. Our functional 
expression of CLC-5 provides a valuable means of investigating 
this further and in assessing the functional effects of the CLC-5 
mutations. 
Expression of the four missense and three nonsense mutations 
(Table 1), and the in-frame deletion of the predicted transmem￾brane domain D2 (Fig. 1), abolished the CLC-5 currents or 
reduced them (S244L and S520P) to levels where they were 
difficult to distinguish from endogenous oocyte currents (Fig. 
3d,f). As a control, we also expressed more conservative changes 
at codons 244 and 520; S244T, S520T, S244A and S520A all 
elicited chloride currents that were similar to the WT (data not 
shown). Thus, the mutations found in the hypercalciuric nephro￾lithiasis pedigrees grossly and specifically affect CLC-5 function, 
thereby strongly suggesting a causal role in the disease. Dent's 
disease, which is characterized by low-molecular-weight protei￾nuria (LMWP), hypercalciuria, nephrocalcinosis, nephrolithiasis, 
rickets and eventual renal failure3·
6, has phenotypic similarities to 
XRN4·
7 and XLRH5 (Fig. 2). However, there are important 
differences, as rickets is absent in XRN, and nephrocalcinosis 
and moderate renal failure are more notable in XLRH. A 
correlation between these phenotypic differences, the different 
mutations (Table 1 and Fig. 1) and the resulting abnormal 
chloride currents (Fig. 3) could not be established. Thus, Dent's 
disease was found to be associated with the mutations W279X,

FIG. 1 Schematic representation of a predicted topology of CLC-5, based 
on the reported DNA sequence9 , to illustrate the mutations associated with 
X-I inked hypercalciuric nephrolithiasis. The mutations found in 11 families 
with X-linked hypercalciuric nephrolithiasis (Table 1) are shown with the 
amino acid highlighted in black and the codon and substituted amino acid 
shown alongside. Arrows 1 and 2 delineate the amino acids predicted to be 
deleted in families 19/94 and 4/94, and arrows 1-3 delineate those 
deleted in family 7.1/94 (Table 1). Every 50th amino acid of the 7 46-
amino acid CLC-5 protein and the consensus phosphorylation (asterisk) and 
glycosylation (branch) sites at codons 349, 350 and 408, respectively, are 
indicated. The correct topology for the CLC channels is unknown and the 
predicted topology of the CLC-5 putative transmembrane domains (D1-
D13) has been revised9 and is based upon a model 10·
15 (inset) that places 
R648X, L200R, S520P, two microdeletions and two donor splice 
site mutations; XRN was associated with R 704X and G506E; and 
XLRH was associated with S244L. In addition, the markedly 
reduced, but not abolished, chloride currents associated with 
S244L were not specific for XLRH as they were also associated 
with S520P in Dent's disease (Fig. 3!), and the undetectable 
chloride currents associated with all the other mutations (Fig. 3) 
were found in XRN and Dent's disease. As may be expected for a 
channel protein, all the disease-causing missense mutations were 
confined to the predicted transmembrane domains (Fig. 1 and 
Table 1). In addition, the R648X and R704X mutations, which 
predict a loss of 100 and 42 amino acids from the cytoplasmic 
carboxy terminus (Fig. 1), delete domain D13, which is conserved 
in all eukaryotic CLC proteins, including the one of Saccharomyces 
cerevisiae 19• This suggests that D13 and the C-terminal region play 
an important but as yet unspecified role. The donor splice site 
mutations (Fig. 2 and Table 1), which are associated with a loss of 
exon 5, lead to an in-frame deletion of the predicted transmem￾446

D4 extracellularly, and in which the hydrophobic core ofthe D9-D12 region 
crosses the membrane 3 or 5 times and contains a hydrophilic region 
(codons 481-502), the precise location of which remains unknown. An 
alternative model placing D2 extracellularly has also been proposed20•
21 , but 
the donor splice site mutations in families 4/94 and 19/94 that result in the 
loss of codons 132-172 (arrows 1 and 2) indicate the importance of this 
segment and provide support for a transmembrane location of D2. The 28 
amino acids (codons 700-728) represent a conserved region that has 
been designated domain 013. The R704X mutation in D13 highlights the 
importance of this region, the function of which remains to be defined. The 
nonsense and donor splice site mutations were found to involve the loops 
and intracellular regions, whereas all the missense mutations occurred 
within the transmembrane spans. 
brane domain D2 (Fig. 1). A splice variant of rCLC-K2, deleted 
for D2, was reported to yield chloride currents indistinguishable 
from those of WT rCLC-K2 (ref. 20), and it was therefore 
proposed that D2 does not cross the membrane 21 • However, our 
findings provide further support for a functional role and trans￾membrane location for D2. 
Our results indicate that CLC-5 is a chloride channel whose 
functional loss results surprisingly in a renal tubulopathy that is 
associated with LMWP, hypercalciuria and nephrolithiasis. The 
resorption of filtered protein occurs almost exclusively in the 
proximal tubule, whereas that of calcium occurs in the proximal 
tubule, the thick ascending limb of Henle's loop, and the distal 
nephron22. Thus, further investigations of CLCN5 expression 
along the human nephron, and of the mechanisms whereby 
CLCN5 mutations lead to LMWP and hypercalciuria, will lead 
to increased understanding of renal tubular function and pathol￾ogy. In addition, our findings, which have defined a common 
molecular pathology of CLCN5 in three disorders of hereditary

(XLRH) has not been assessed for LMWP but 111.1, 111.5, 111.9, 111.12 and IV.3

WT by 123 bp, which is the size of exon 5, were obtained in families 19/94

METHODS. RNA was extracted from an Epstein- Barr virus-transformed 
lymphoblastoid cell line obtained from peripheral blood cells of each 
proband using methods published previously23 . RT- PCR was performed 
using pairs of nested CLCN5-specific primers and the following conditions: 
25 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C, annealing at 60 oc and extension at 
72 oc, each for 30 s. The PCR products were gel purified and the DNA 
sequences of both strands determined by Taq polymerase cycle sequencing 
and a semi-automated detection system (ABI-3 73 sequencer) as described 
previously24 • Genomic DNA, restriction enzyme and SSO studies were 
performed as described previously25 .

were introduced by recombinant PCR and sequenced. Capped RNA was

10 ng of cRNA was injected into Xenopus oocytes prepared and handled as 
described previously27 • After 2-3 days at 16 oc, oocytes were examined at 
room temperature by standard two-electrode voltage-clamp technique. 
Standard extracellular solution was ND96 (96 mM NaCI, 2 mM KCI, 
1.8 mM CaCI 2 , 1 mM MgCI2 , 5 mM HEPES, pH 7.4), or ND96 in which 
part of the NaCI was replaced by Nal. For every construct, we used three 
different batches of cRNAs and at least three different batches of oocytes, 
always with similar results. In addition, the translatability of cRNA was 
confirmed by in vitro translation.

Preferential activation of 
midbrain dopamine 
neurons by appetitive 
rather than aversive stimuli

MIDBRAIN dopamine systems are crucially involved in motiva￾tional processes underlying the learning and execution of goal￾directed behaviou~- • Dopamine neurons in monkeys are uniformly 
activated by unpredicted appetitive stimuli such as food and liquid 
rewards and conditioned, reward-predicting stimuli. By contrast, 
fully predicted stimuli are ineffective6-8, and the omission of 
predicted reward depresses their activity9• These characteristics 
follow associative-learning rules10·u, suggesting that dopamine 
responses report an error in reward prediction12• Accordingly, 
neural network models are efficiently trained using a dopamine￾like reinforcement signal13•
14• However, it is unknown whether the 
responses to environmental stimuli concern specific motivational 
attributes or reflect more general stimulus salience4'
15• To resolve 
this, we have compared dopamine impulse responses to motiva￾tionally opposing appetitive and aversive stimuli. In contrast to 
appetitive events, primary and conditioned non-noxious aversive 
stimuli either failed to activate dopamine neurons or, in cases of 
close resemblance with appetitive stimuli, induced weaker

responses than appetitive stimuli. Thus, dopamine neurons 
preferentially report environmental stimuli with appetitive 
rather than aversive motivational value. 
Two monkeys were instrumentally conditioned with visual and 
auditory stimuli. Appetitive conditioned stimuli eliciting lever 
pressing for a juice reward alternated randomly with aversive 
conditioned stimuli inducing hand withdrawal from a resting key 
in order to avoid a mild air puff to the hand or hypertonic saline to 
the mouth. Appetitive and aversive stimuli were adjusted to 
comparable motivational strength by setting juice drop size, air 
pressure and saline drop size slightly above a threshold below 
which task performance dropped sharply. Task performance was 
>90-95% correct. Outside the task, animals were presented with 
free juice drops but not with air puffs or hypertonic saline, which 
rapidly disrupted their collaboration. 
We used two monkeys to record from dopamine neurons in 
midbrain catecholamine cell groups AS (23 neurons dorsal to 
lateral substantia nigra), A9 (251 neurons in pars compacta of 
substantia nigra) and AlO ( 40 neurons in ventral tegmental area); 
we distinguished these from other midbrain neurons by their 
distinctive electrophysiological characteristics, which consisted 
of polyphasic, relatively long discharges occurring at com￾paratively low frequencies6-8•
16. Most dopamine neurons were 
phasically activated by primary and conditioned appetitive stimuli 
at short mean latencies of 93-115 ms, thus confirming earlier 
results6-8 (conditioned light: 100 of 12S neurons, 7S%; con￾ditioned sound: 120 of 15S neurons, 76%; free juice: 62 of SO 
neurons, 7S% ). In contrast, very few dopamine neurons were 
activated by aversive stimuli, such as a conditioned sound for air 
puff (1 of31 neurons, 3% ), light for air puff (S of 56 neurons, 14%) 
or fractal picture for saline ( 4 of 30 neurons, 13%) (Fig. 1 ). The 
total of 13 neurons activated by conditioned aversive stimuli 
belonged to groups AS (5 of 12 neurons), A9 (7 of S9) and AlO 
(1 of 16), suggesting a potential mediolateral gradient for the few 
aversive responses. These few aversive responses failed to result in 
an average population response (Fig. 3b, d right). The infrequent 
primary aversive air puff activated only 7 of 51 neurons (14% ), all 
of them being in A9 (Fig. 2). Sixteen of the total 20 neurons 
with aversive responses also showed appetitive responses. The 
low responsiveness to aversive stimuli cannot be attributed to 
movement differences which have been shown not to influence 
dopamine neurons7•17•18• Conditioned aversive stimuli elicited 
depressions in 36 of 117 neurons (31 %; Fig. 1, bottom), reminis￾cent of depressions related to the omission of expected reward9• 
The chronology of experiments demonstrates the way dopa￾mine neurons were preferentially activated by appetitive stimuli. 
The first animal was extensively conditioned with a small light for 
appetitive outcome. Later, an adjacent, similar light of a different 
colour served as the aversive stimulus associated with air-puff 
avoidance and alternated randomly with the appetitive light, the 
animal discriminating well between them. Dopamine neurons 
discriminated quantitatively between these motivationally oppos￾ing stimuli, the appetitive light activating the majority of them 
whereas the similar aversive light activated fewer neurons and at 
lower magnitudes (Fig. 3a). In order to distinguish between 
genuinely, albeit lower, aversive responsiveness and confounding 
generalization to appetitive stimuli, we subsequently conditioned 
an auditory aversive stimulus previously not associated with 
appetitive outcome. As already described, only 1 of 31 neurons 
was activated by the aversive sound (Fig. 3b ), suggesting that the 
aversive activations of Fig. 3a were due to stimulus generalization. 
In a third step, we tested the general effectiveness of auditory 
stimuli by reversing stimulus modalities and indeed found most 
neurons to be activated by the appetitive sound (Fig. 3c). 
Although behavioural response to the appetitive light had been 
extinguished, the similar aversive light was still effective, albeit 
with many fewer neurons and at lower response magnitude. This 
responsiveness may either suggest a remaining appetitive 'tag' on 
visual stimuli or a general visual response preference. When 
testing this, we avoided stimulus generalization by presenting
