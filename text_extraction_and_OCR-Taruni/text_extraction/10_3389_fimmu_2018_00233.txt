T regulatory cells, a specialized subset of T cells, are key players in modulating anti￾gen (Ag)-specific immune responses in  vivo. Inducible T  regulatory type 1 (Tr1) cells 
are characterized by the co-expression of CD49b and lymphocyte-activation gene 3 
(LAG-3) and the ability to secrete IL-10, TGF-β, and granzyme (Gz) B, in the absence of 
IL-4 and IL-17. The chief mechanisms by which Tr1 cells control immune responses are 
secretion of IL-10 and TGF-β and killing of myeloid cells via GzB. Tr1 cells, first described 
in peripheral blood of patients who developed tolerance after HLA-mismatched fetal liver 
hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, have been proven to modulate inflammatory and 
effector T cell responses in several immune-mediated diseases. The possibility to gener￾ate and expand Tr1 cells in vitro in an Ag-specific manner has led to their clinical use as 
cell therapy in patients. Clinical grade protocols to generate or to enrich and expand Tr1 
cell medicinal products have been established. Proof-of-concept clinical trials with Tr1 
cell products have demonstrated the safety and the feasibility of this approach and 
indicated some clinical benefit. In the present review, we provide an overview on proto￾cols established to induce/expand Tr1 cells in vitro for clinical application and on results 
obtained in Tr1 cell-based clinical trials. Moreover, we will discuss a recently developed 
protocol to efficient convert human CD4+ T  cells into a homogeneous population of 
Tr1-like cells by lentiviral vector-mediated IL-10 gene transfer.

INTRODUCTION
T regulatory type 1 (Tr1) cells are a subset of adaptive CD4+ T cells that promote immune tolerance 
and control excessive and/or inappropriate inflammation mediated by effector T cells and antigen￾presenting cells (APCs). In contrast to thymic-derived T regulatory cells (Tregs) that constitutively 
express the transcription factor (TF) FOXP3 (FOXP3+ Tregs) (1, 2), Tr1 cells can only transiently 
upregulate FOXP3 upon activation (3–7).
Tr1 cells are memory CD4+ T cells that co-express the integrin alpha2 subunit (CD49b) and 
the lymphocyte-activation gene 3 (LAG-3) (7). Although other cell surface markers, including 
PD-1, ICOS, TIGIT, CD39, CD73, TIM-3, GITR, OX40, TNFRSF9, and CEACAM-1 (8), have 
been associated with Tr1 cells, their expression on other cell types precludes them from being 
defined as Tr1-specific markers. Tr1 cells produce high levels of IL-10 and TGF-β; variable amounts 
of IFN-γ; and low/no IL-2, IL-4, and IL-17 (6, 7, 9, 10) and have a specific gene signature (7). 
In addition, Tr1 cells have unique metabolic requirements that distinguish them from FOXP3+
Tregs: Tr1 cells depend on glycolysis and are inhibited by hypoxia and extracellular ATP (11), while 
peripheral FOXP3+ Tregs depend on fatty acid oxidation (12).

Figure 1 | T regulatory type 1 (Tr1)-mediated suppression in vivo. In steady-state condition, Tr1 cells reside in the spleen and circulate in the periphery. During 
inflammation, Tr1 cells are recruited to the site of tissue injury (i.e., after infections, autoimmune reactions, or transplantation) and are activated by professional 
antigen-presenting cells [APCs; dendritic cells (DCs)] via their T cell receptor, thus by their cognate antigen (Ag). Upon activation, Tr1 cells secrete IL-10 and TGF-β
and (1) directly inhibit effector T cell (i.e., Th1 and Th17 cells) proliferation and pro-inflammatory cytokines production and (2) indirectly inhibit effector T cells by 
modulating professional APCs (i.e., downregulation of costimulatory and HLA class II expression and inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion). (3) Tr1 cells 
can suppress effector T cells by cell-to-cell contact-mediated mechanisms, (4) suppress CD8+ T cell responses (i.e., proliferation and IFN-γ production), and (5)
mediate bystander suppression by specifically killing professional APCs [DC or macrophages (M)], thus preventing naive T (Tn) cell priming and reactivation of 
effector T cells (i.e., Th1 and Th17 cells). Concomitantly, (6) Tr1 cells via IL-10 and TGF-β promote the induction of tolerogenic DC and anti-inflammatory 
macrophages (M2), which in turn promote de novo induction of Tr1 cells and T regulatory cells (Tregs), restoring tissue homeostasis and promoting long-term 
tolerance.

The main mechanism of Tr1-mediated suppression is the secre￾tion of IL-10 and TGF-β. Importantly, Tr1 cells require activation 
via their T cell receptor, thus by their cognate antigen (Ag), to 
mediate suppression, but, once activated, they mediate bystander 
suppression against other Ags (6, 9). The expression of gran￾zyme (Gz) B endows Tr1 cells with the ability to specifically kill 
myeloid APCs (6, 13). Similar to FOXP3+ Tregs, Tr1 cells also 
inhibit T  cell responses via CTLA-4/CD80 and PD-1/PDL-1 
interactions (14) and metabolic disruption (15) (Figure 1). IL-10 
signaling is required for maintaining high IL-10 production 
by Tr1 cells, which in turn is necessary for controlling inflam￾matory responses. Notably, in the absence of IL-10-mediated 
signaling, Tr1 cells lose their ability to secrete IL-10, but they still 
express GzB and CTLA-4 (16). These findings suggest that in the 
absence of IL-10/IL-10R-mediated signaling, and consequent 
IL-10 production, Tr1 cells may suppress immune responses via
alternative mechanisms such as specific killing of APCs and/or 
cell-to-cell contact-mediated inhibition of effector T  cells and 
APCs (Figure 1).
IL-10 is the driving cytokine for Tr1 cell differentiation and 
function (9, 16). In the past years, it has become evident that acti￾vation of CD4+ T cells in the presence of IL-27, key regulator of 
IL-10 production in T cells (17), promotes the differentiation of 
Tr1 cells in mice (11, 18–20). In T cells, the downstream effects 
of IL-10/IL-10R interaction is signaling via STAT3 (21), and 
although no formal proof for the critical role of STAT3 in Tr1 cell

differentiation exists, several evidences indicate that it represents 
the link between IL-10/IL-10R and downstream activation of 
TFs involved in Tr1 cell induction and functions. Specifically, 
(i) overexpression of active STAT3 in T cells promotes Tr1 cell 
induction (22), (ii) IL-27-dependent induction of IL-10 is STAT1 
and STAT3 mediated (23), and (iii) STAT3 interacts with the aryl 
hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) that by inducing HIF-1α degrada￾tion leads to the stabilization of the glycolytic metabolism in Tr1 
cells (11).
A plethora of TFs have been shown to be involved in driving 
Tr1 cell differentiation, phenotype, and functions (24). The TFs 
c-Maf and AhR induced by IL-27 bind together to transactivate 
the IL-21 and IL-10 promoters. While IL-21 maintains c-Maf 
and AhR expression, the expression of IL-10 is essential for the 
suppressive function of Tr1 cells. Moreover, IL-27-induced AhR, 
alone or with an unknown cofactor, promotes GzB expression in 
Tr1 cells. The latter mechanism allows killing of myeloid APCs 
(18, 19, 25, 26). Additional TFs have been shown to activate 
IL-10 promoter during IL-27-mediated induction of Tr1 cells: 
the early response gene 2 (27) and B lymphocyte-induced 
maturation protein-1 (Blimp-1) (28). Based on the above stud￾ies, it has been proposed that two transcriptional components 
activate IL-10 in Tr1 cells upon IL-27 stimulation: c-Maf and 
Ahr are required for promoting IL-10 production under certain 
conditions, whereas Egr-2 via STAT3 induces Blimp-1 and 
IL-10 production (29). More recently, it has been suggested that 
after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, Ag presentation 
in the presence of macrophage-derived IL-27 promotes Tr1 
cell differentiation via Blimp-1 and eomesodermin (eomes). 
Eomes enables stable IL-10 production and consequently Tr1 
cell induction in vivo (30). Moreover, the early induction of IRF1 
and BAFT expression has been shown to be essential for IL-27-
mediated induction of murine Tr1 cells (31). In the latter study, 
it was proposed that while BAFT is required for both Th17 and 
Tr1 cell induction, IRF4 and IRF1 are differentially required for 
the two cell subsets (31). However, this conclusion is in contrast 
with the demonstration that activin-A promotes human Tr1 
cells via activation of IRF4 that along with AhR binds to IL-10
and icos promoters (32). Moreover, ITK signaling via Ras/IRF4 
pathway regulates the induction and function of both murine 
IL-27-induced Tr1 cells and human IL-10-induced Tr1 cells 
(33). ITK kinase activity is indeed critical for AhR, c-MAF, 
and IRF4 expression in T cells during Tr1 cell differentiation. 
Overall, despite the increased knowledge on the different path￾ways involved in promoting IL-10 production in T cells during 
Tr1 cell induction via IL-27 or IL-10, the master TF for Tr1 cells 
still remains unclear.
In vivo studies demonstrated that Tr1 cells circulate in periph￾eral blood (7) but are induced and also localized in tissues where 
IL-10 plays an essential role in maintaining homeostasis, such as 
the intestinal mucosa (34, 35). Recent observations in preclinical 
models indicate that Tr1 cells induced in the intestinal mucosa 
migrate to the periphery and control effector T cell responses and 
the development of type 1 diabetes (36). Interestingly, in  vitro
induced human Tr1 cells express the gut-homing receptors 
GPR15 and CCR9, supporting the capacity of Tr1 cells to migrate 
to the intestinal mucosa (37). Moreover, in vivo induced Tr1 cells 
have been identified in the spleen of tolerant mice (38). It still 
remains unclear whether Tr1 cells are generated in the spleen or 
if the spleen represents the in vivo natural “reservoir” of Tr1 cells. 
Moreover, it has not been demonstrated yet whether this organ is 
also the privileged site for Tr1 cell accumulation in humans. The 
discovery of CD49b and LAG-3 as specific biomarkers of Tr1 cells 
(7) renders possible to better study the in vivo localization of Tr1 
cells in physiological and pathological conditions.
Tr1 CELLS AND THEIR ROLE
IN TOLERANCE INDUCTION
A defect in Tr1 cell frequency/function has been consistently 
demonstrated in a number of autoimmune and inflammatory 
diseases in preclinical and clinical models, indicating that IL-10-
producing Tr1 cells are relevant for disease protection [reviewed 
in Ref. (10)]. These evidences built the rationale for medical 
intervention for Tr1 cell boosting in vivo to prevent/cure T cell￾mediated diseases. Several stimuli have been used to promote 
Tr1 cell induction in vivo. We and other demonstrated the ability 
of IL-10 or IL-10-inducing agents in combination with immu￾nosuppressive treatments to generate Tr1 cell in in vivo models 
of autoimmunity or allogeneic transplantation. Among others, 
interesting treatments to promote Tr1 cells in vivo are the admin￾istration of anti-CD3 monoclonal antibodies or tolerogenic DCs, 
which in both preclinical models and in humans have been dem￾onstrated to promote Tr1 cells. Alternatively, in vivo administra￾tion of soluble Ags has been proved to promote repolarization of 
autoimmune T cells into Tr1 cells in preclinical models [reviewed 
in Ref. (10)]. Some of these approaches have been translated to 
treat autoimmune diseases, including type 1 diabetes (T1D) and 
multiple sclerosis (MS). The first-in-man clinical trials with HLA￾DR4-restricted proinsulin peptide or ATX-MS-1647, a cocktail 
of myelin basic protein-derived peptides, demonstrated the 
safety of these approaches without the induction/re-activation 
of pro-inflammatory autoimmune response, but with limited 
benefit for the patients (39, 40). Interestingly, in T1D patients, 
proinsulin peptide immunotherapy was associated with the 
transient appearance of Ag-specific IL-10+ CD4+ T cells (39), and 
in treated MS patients, a trend toward high levels of IL-10 gene 
expression associated with reduced Ag-specific T cell prolifera￾tion has been observed (40). These preliminary data indicate that 
peptide immunotherapy in autoimmune diseases may boost 
in vivo Ag-specific Tr1 cells.
T regulatory type 1 cells have been associated with long-term 
transplantation tolerance, induced or spontaneously established, 
in preclinical and clinical settings (38, 41, 42). Moreover, after 
the first demonstration that adoptive transfer of in vitro induced 
Ag-specific Tr1 cells efficiently prevents colitis induced in SCID 
mice by pathogenic T  cells (9), several studies demonstrated 
that in vitro induced Tr1 cells can be used as cellular therapy to 
treat inflammatory and autoimmune disease as well as to control 
graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) and to prevent organ rejection 
[reviewed in Ref. (10)]. These evidences built the rationale for 
medical intervention with in vitro generated Tr1 cells to cure T-cell 
mediated diseases and to promote transplantation tolerance.

allogeneic DC and transduced with LV-IL-10 upon secondary stimulation. After selection, IL-10-trasduced cells are expanded in vitro with feeder mixture (48).

GENERATION OF Tr1 CELL MEDICINAL 
PRODUCTS
Several good manufacturing practice (GMP) compatible proto￾cols have been established to generate human Ag-specific Tr1 
cells. Originally, we induced alloAg-specific Tr1 cells by culturing 
human PBMCs (or purified CD4+ T cells) with allogeneic mono￾cytes in the presence of exogenous human IL-10 [mixed lym￾phocytes reactions (MLR)/IL-10, Figure 2] (9). With this culture 
condition, a population of IL-10-anergized T  cells is induced: 
these bulk populations are anergic in response to the alloAgs 
used for priming and contain precursors of IL-10-producing 
alloAg-specific Tr1 cells, as demonstrated by single cell T cell 
cloning of alloAg-specific Tr1 cells (9, 43). Moreover, after IL-10 
anergization, the bulk cultures also contain non-alloAg-specific 
T  cells that respond to other Ags, such as pathogens or third￾party alloAgs (44, 45). Being a mixed population of cells, the 
IL-10-anergized cultures on one hand give rise to alloAg-specific

Tr1 cells able to induce and sustain tolerance in the absence of 
immunosuppression, and on the other hand, they contain T cells 
with the ability to mount an efficacious immune response against 
infectious agents, when adoptively transferred into an immune￾suppressed host. These features offer a strong rationale for the 
use of IL-10-anergized T cells as cell therapy to improve immu￾noreconstitution in immunocompromised hosts such as patients 
after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) and 
to modulate responses to alloAgs and promote long-lasting toler￾ance (Table 1).
The discovery of DC-10, a subset of monocyte-derived 
human DC, which secrete high levels of IL-10 and express the 
tolerogenic molecules ILT4 and HLA-G (51), offered the possibil￾ity to modify the protocol to generate alloAg-specific Tr1 cells 
(Figure 2). Functional assays demonstrated that stimulation of 
human PBMCs or CD4+ T cells with allogeneic DC-10 induces 
the differentiation of anergic alloAg-specific IL-10-producing Tr1 
cells (45, 51). DC-10, in contrast to monocytes and exogenous 
IL-10, can promote T cell anergy not only in fully mismatched 
pairs but also in matched-unrelated pairs (45). Moreover, DC-10-
anergized T  cells contain up to 15% of already differentiated 
alloAg-specific CD49b+LAG-3+ Tr1 cells (Figure  2A, right), 
whereas, as discussed above, MLR/IL-10 cultures are enriched 
of IL-10-producing Tr1 cell precursors (Figure 2B) (43, 45). The 
MLR/IL-10 and MLR/DC-10 methods have been validated in 
GMP grade laboratories.
More recently, two optimized clinical grade compatible pro￾tocols for the induction of alloAg-specific Tr1 cells have been 
established. For a clinical trial in HSCT for hematological malig￾nancies, a GMP compatible protocol in which purified donor￾derived CD4+ T cells are cultured with tolerogenic DC-10 of host 
origin in the presence of IL-10 for 10 days to obtain alloAg-specific 
Tr1 cells (named T-allo10, Bacchetta and Roncarolo, Clinical￾gov identifier NCT03198234) have been established (Table 1). 
In this setting, donor-derived T cells react against patient (host) 
alloAgs and mediate GvHD; therefore, to suppress GvHD after 
allo-HSCT, Tr1 cells ex vivo generated are donor-derived and 
specific for patient alloAgs. For a clinical trial in kidney transplant 
recipients planned under the umbrella of “The ONE study” (52), 
a GMP-compatible protocol to generate donor-specific Tr1-
enriched cell medicinal product [named T10 cells (46)] has 
been developed (Table  1). In this protocol, donor-specific 
Tr1 cells are induced by culturing CD4+ T cells isolated from 
patients on dialysis with donor DC-10 in the presence of 
exogenous IL-10 for 10  days. In the contest of organ trans￾plantation, patient T  cells react against transplanted organ 
and mediate rejection; therefore, to prevent graft rejection, 
Tr1 cells ex vivo induced are patient-derived and specific for 
donor alloAgs. T10 and T-allo10 medicinal products contain 
a higher proportion of CD49b+LAG-3+ Tr1 cells compared to 
the IL-10-anergized T cells obtained by in vitro stimulation of 
donor-derived PBMCs with host CD3-depleted PBMCs in the 
presence of IL-10 [(46) and Bacchetta and Roncarolo, Clinical￾gov identifier NCT03198234]. Tr1 cell medicinal products need 
to meet a number of release criteria for their in vivo delivery: (i) 
quality controls during the manufacturing, i.e., number, purity, 
and viability of CD14+ cells used for DC-10 differentiation, of 
CD4+ T  cells, and of DC-10; (ii) quality controls of the final 
products, i.e., number, purity, and viability of T10 or T-allo10 
cells, contamination of non-CD4+ T cells, and the percentage of 
allospecific T cell anergy, i.e., allospecific proliferation of T10 or 
T-allo10 medicinal product/allospecific proliferation of control 
cells generated in parallel by culturing CD4+ T cells with mature 
DC (46).
An alternative method to induce/expand Ag-specific Tr1 
cell medicinal product has been developed by the France-based 
company TxCell.1
 The method includes the use of Drosophila￾derived artificial APCs (Schneider cells) transfected with a 
transmembrane form of a murine anti-human CD3 antibody, 
human CD80, human CD58, human IL-2, and human IL-4 
(4). The expansion of Ag-specific Tr1 cell clones requires first 
stimulation of PBMCs with a specific Ag [i.e., ovalbumin (OVA)] 
in the presence of IL-2 and IL-4 to enrich for Ag-specific T cells, 
followed by T cell cloning by limiting dilution and expansion of 
the T cell clones using Schneider cells (Figure 1). This method 
has been applied to expand a large number of OVA-specific Tr1 
cell clones (termed Ovasave®) that have been infused in patients 
affected with refractory Crohn’s disease (CD) (50) (Table  1). 
With a similar procedure, collagen II-specific Tr1 cell clones 
(Col-Treg) were produced from PBMCs of rheumatoid arthritis 
patients (5) (Table 1).

Tr1-BASED CLINICAL TRIALS
Treg cell-based cell therapy was first used to prevent GvHD 
after allogeneic HSCT. These proof-of-concept clinical trials 
demonstrated the feasibility and safety of the approach [reviewed 
in Ref. (53)] and paved the way to a wider application of Tregs as 
medical products for the treatment of autoimmune and chronic 
inflammatory disease and the prevention of organ rejection. 
Several trials are ongoing with different types of Tregs, including 
CD25+Tregs and Tr1 cells (53). A major difference between the 
CD25+ Tregs and Tr1 cells is that a pool of polyclonal non-Ag￾specific cells are administered in the former, whereas Ag-specific 
products are infused with the latter.
T regulatory type 1 cell-based therapy mediated fast immune 
reconstitution and prevented severe GvHD in patients with 
advanced hematological malignancies undergoing haploidenti￾cal HSCT therapy [the ALT-TEN trial (49), Table  1]. A high 
dose (average of 12  ×  106
/kg CD34+ cells) of haploidentical 
purified CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells, virtually devoid of 
T cells (≤2.6 × 104
/kg CD3+ cells), was infused in myeloablated 
patients. Once there were signs of myeloid engraftment, the 
donor-derived, host-alloAg-specific IL-10-anergized T  cells 
were infused in patients in the absence of immunosuppression 
for GvHD prophylaxis. Results show that the treatment was 
safe and well tolerated. Clinical outcome of patients treated in 
the ALT-TEN trial suggests that donor-derived IL-10-anergized 
T  cells could sustain immune reconstitution with no severe 
GvHD and no disease relapse. Moreover, the results suggest that 
a higher number of Tr1 cells within the total T cell suspension 
would provide enhanced activity to prevent GvHD. An improved 
method to generate alloAg-specific Tr1 cells (T-allo10 and T10 
cells) using DC-10 has been established (see above). T-allo10 cells 
are currently tested in a phase I trial in patients with hematologic 
malignancies receiving un-manipulated HSCT from mismatched 
related or mismatched unrelated donors with the aim of prevent￾ing acute and chronic GvHD (T-allo10, Clinical-gov identifier 
NCT03198234, Table  1). In organ transplantation, as part of 
The ONE Study,2
 T10 cells will be infused in living donor renal 
transplant recipients [(46), Table 1].
Tr1 cell-based therapy has been also tested to treat patients 
affected with refractory CD (50). In a phase I/IIa clinical, the 
CATS1 study, OVA-specific Tr1 cell clones (Ovasave®), generated 
as described above, were infused in CD patients, who ingested an 
OVA-enriched diet to activate OVA-specific Tr1 cells migrating 
to the gut (Table 1). Multiple doses of the cell product Ovasave®
were injected, and a response was observed in 40% of patients, 
with a stronger effect in the group of patients who received the 
lowest Tr1 cell dose (50). The study demonstrated the safety of 
the approach and showed some clinical benefit. However, the 
clinical effect was limited, reaching the maximum at 5 weeks after 
treatment and declining thereafter. Col-Treg will be tested in a 
clinical study for severe and refractory autoimmune uveitis (see 
text footnote 1; Table 1).

Overall these first clinical trials showed the feasibility, the 
safety, and potential clinical benefit of the Tr1 cell-based cell 
therapy approach. Because of their Ag specificity, Tr1 cells have 
the potential to be applied in several clinical settings.
IL-10-ENGINEERED CD4+ T CELLS
The limitations to broaden the clinical application of Tr1 cells are 
as follows: (a) the presence of potential contaminating non-Tr1 
cells in the preparation; (b) limited expansion capacity in vitro.
The discovery of Tr1 cell-specific biomarkers, CD49b and LAG-3 
(7), opened the possibility to isolate alloAg-specific Tr1 cells 
from in vitro cultures. Specifically, we showed that FACS-sorted 
CD49b+LAG-3+ T  cells from DC-10-induced Tr1 cell popula￾tions had higher suppressive capacity compared to the original 
bulk population (7).
An alternative strategy to generate a large number of Tr1 
cells is to induce stable and sustained overexpression of IL-10 
into conventional CD4+ T cells. We developed a protocol based 
on the use of bidirectional LVs co-encoding for human IL-10
and a marker gene of selection [i.e., GFP (47)]. We demon￾strated that LV-mediated human IL-10 gene transfer converted 
conventional human CD4+ T cells into Tr1-like cells, termed 
CD4IL-10 cells (Figure 2; Table 1). CD4IL-10 cells are phenotypi￾cally and functionally similar to Tr1 cells: they secrete high 
levels of IL-10, suppress T cell responses via IL-10 and TGF-β, 
and prevent xenoGVHD in humanized models (47). More 
recently, we modified our vector platform by substituting GFP 
with ΔNGFR, as a clinical grade marker gene for selection, 
and we demonstrated that CD4IL-10 cells acquire not only the 
potential to suppress T cell responses in vitro and in vivo, but 
also the ability to specifically kill myeloid leukemic cell lines 
and blasts in an HLA class I-dependent but Ag-independent 
manner (48). CD4IL-10 cells indeed selectively eliminate CD13+
leukemic cells, and for optimal killing of target cells, they 
require stable CD54/LFA-1-mediated adhesion and CD112/
CD226-mediated activation. Importantly, CD4IL-10 cells medi￾ate antitumor and antileukemic effects in vivo in humanized 
mouse models of solid myeloid tumors and leukemia (48). 
This newly identified antileukemic activity of CD4IL-10 cells is 
of critical importance, since an active area of investigation is 
the identification of regimens that prevents GvHD after allo￾HSCT without affecting graft-versus-leukemia (GvL) activity 
of donor T  lymphocytes. In a newly developed protocol of 
GvHD/GvL in humanized mice, we demonstrated that CD4IL￾10 cells adoptively transferred in  vivo prevent xenoGvHD 
mediated by allogeneic PBMC and collaborate with PBMC in 
mediating GvL. The LV-hIL-10 platform has been also applied 
to generate IL-10-engineered alloAg-specific Tr1-like cells, 
namely allo-CD4IL-10 cells (Figure  2; Table  1). Allo-CD4IL-10
cells suppress alloAg-specific T cell responses in vitro and kill 
myeloid target cells in an Ag-independent manner. Overall, 
we showed that enforced IL-10 expression in conventional 
or allospecific CD4+ T  cells promotes their conversion into 
Tr1-like suppressor cells able to kill myeloid cell lines (48). 
These findings pave the way for adoptive cell therapy with 
IL-10-engineered T  cells in patients undergoing allogeneic

organ and HSCT transplantation for oncological diseases. 
Moreover, the antitumor and antileukemic activity of CD4IL-10
cells can be considered for ad hoc immunotherapy in relapsing 
patients.
FUTURE PERSPECTIVES
The discovery that Tr1 cells modulate immune responses led to 
the idea that they could be developed as a therapeutic product 
to promote/restore tolerance in transplantation and in inflam￾matory and autoimmune diseases. The completed clinical trials 
proved the safety of Tr1 cell-based therapy and indicate potential 
therapeutic effects. AlloAg-specific Tr1 cells can be generated 
in vitro, and protocols have been translated into clinical practice. 
It remained a major challenge to expand or generate Ag-specific 
Tr1 cells suitable for cell-based approaches in autoimmune 
diseases. Schneider cells have been shown to efficiently sustain 
Ag-specific Tr1 cell clone expansion for clinical application. 
However, Tr1 cell clones have limited survival capacity in vivo
upon chronic activation (50, 54). The discovery that LV-mediated 
IL-10 gene transfer converts conventional polyclonal and 
alloAg-specific T  cells into Tr1-like cells paves the way for 
applying this technology to generate a large number of Tr1 cells 
from Ag-specific T  cells isolated from the peripheral blood of 
patients. Transcriptome analysis of this engineered Tr1-like cells 
will allow us to identify the key molecules involved in Tr1 cell 
immunomodulatory function.
