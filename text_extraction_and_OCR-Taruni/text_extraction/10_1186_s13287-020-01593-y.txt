Abstract
Objective: To determine the impact of donor age on the therapeutic effect of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal
stem cells (BMSCs) in treating adverse remodeling as the result of right ventricle (RV) pressure overload.
Methods: BMSCs were isolated from neonatal (< 1 month), infant (1 month to 1 year), and young children (1 year to
5 years) and were compared in their migration potential, surface marker expression, VEGF secretion, and matrix
metalloprotein (MMP) 9 expression. Four-week-old male C57 mice underwent pulmonary artery banding and
randomized to treatment and untreated control groups. During the surgery, BMSCs were administered to the mice
by intramyocardial injection into the RV free wall. Four weeks later, RV function and tissue were analyzed by
echocardiography, histology, and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction.
Results: Human neonatal BMSCs demonstrated the greatest migration capacity and secretion of vascular
endothelial growth factor but no difference in expression of surface markers. Neonate BMSCs administration
resulted in increasing expression of VEGF, a significant reduction in RV wall thickness, and internal diameter in mice
after PA banding. These beneficial effects were probably associated with paracrine secretion as no cardiomyocyte
transdifferentiation was observed.
Conclusions: Human BMSCs from different age groups have different characteristics, and the youngest BMSCs may
favorably impact the application of stem cell-based therapy to alleviate adverse RV remodeling induced by pressure
overload.

Introduction
Since their identification by Friedenstein et al. [1], bone
marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) have
been known for their high proliferative potential, ability
to differentiate into other cell lineages [2], support of
hematopoietic cells, and promotion of the secretion of
various cytokines including vascular endothelial growth
factor (VEGF) [3]. These impressive abilities have en￾couraged extensive research on stem cell-based therapies
for heart diseases, such as myocardial infarction, right
ventricular hypertrophy (RVH), and dilated cardiomyop￾athy, improving the performance of the injured heart [4].
RVH is a common complication in congenital heart dis￾ease (CHD). Prolonged hypertrophy is a risk factor for
the progression of cardiac dysfunction and cardiac sud￾den death in children with CHD, which lacks effective
treatments. The safety and efficacy of autologous BMSC
transplantation paves the way for the treatment of RVH
[5]. To date, large animal models have shown that intra￾myocardial injection of stem cells is safe and feasible [6].
The encouraging effects triggered by stem cell therapy
prompted clinical trials [7], which confirmed the former
hypothesis.

Despite extensive researches, the therapeutic effects
have varied from experiment to experiment, and the po￾tential mechanisms related to those effects remain un￾clear. There are various pathways involved in the
development of cardiac hypertrophy and studies on the
potential molecular mechanisms have identified thera￾peutic targets for the prevention of hypertrophy [8, 9]. It
was reported that human BMSCs probably preserve car￾diac function by inducing participation of VEGF in the
anti-hypertrophic pathway in vivo [10]. However, this
particular paracrine secretion of BMSC tended to have
an age-associated decline, therefore limiting the potential
of cell-based therapy to some extent. Additionally, the
composition of MSCs changes during development and
aging, and each subpopulation of the dynamic system
probably has a particular function [11]. The sensitive
age-associated change in characteristics and regenerative
function of BMSCs is probably attributed to environ￾mental stimuli, including extracellular matrix and circu￾lating metabolites [12]. Some researchers have reported
that the administration of allogeneic BMSCs from youn￾ger donors achieved better cardiac recovery in a myocar￾dial infarction animal model [13, 14]. However, to date,
evidence of age-associated effects on BMSC-based ther￾apy remains insufficient.
The current study was designed to test the hypothesis
that human neonatal BMSCs present the highest prolif￾erative capacity and paracrine secretion through in vitro
experiments, which favorably impact their application in
RVH mice.
Methods
Isolation and culture of human and mouse BMSCs
The study was approved by the Institutional Ethics
Committee of Shanghai Children’s Medical Center. Ap￾proximately 2 mL of bone marrow was obtained from
children with various CHDs who were receiving recon￾structive heart surgeries. These patients were divided
into three groups according to their ages: group 1 (< 1
month), group 2 (1 month to 1 year), and group 3 (1 year
to 5 years). Isolation of human marrow sample was con￾ducted in accordance with a previously reported proto￾col [15]. Briefly, the bone marrow was diluted in HBSS
after collection in a 20-mL syringe containing 2 mL of
preservative-free heparin (400 U/mL). BMSCs were iso￾lated from the bone marrow cells by Percoll density cen￾trifugation. The cell suspension was adjusted and seeded
at 1.8 × 105 nucleated cells per cm2
. The medium was
changed every 3–4 days and BMSCs were collected at
passage 3 for further experiments.
Flow cytometry
Human BMSCs were trypsinized at passage 3, washed
twice with PBS, and incubated with 0.1% bovine serum
albumin (BSA) in PBS for 1 h at 4 °C with antibodies
against CD34, CD45, CD 44, and CD105. Analysis was
performed using a FACS flow cytometer.
Transwell assay
For the migration assay, passage 3 BMSCs were seeded
into the upper chamber of a Transwell plate with a
fibronectin-coated filter (8-mm pore size, Corning Life
Sciences). The bottom chamber contained medium sup￾plemented with 10% FBS. After incubation for 18 h in
37 °C, cells adherent to the upper surface of the filter
were removed. The cells attached to the bottom of the
membranes were fixed with methanol and stained with
crystal violet.
Wound-healing assay
Cell migration was determined by measurement of the
cells moving close to an artificial wound. Cells were
wounded with a 200-μL pipette tip, washed with PBS,
and incubated in medium for 12 h. The movement of
cells was monitored by microscopy.
Western blotting
Human and mouse cells were washed in PBS, harvested
by centrifugation, resuspended in lysis buffer, and centri￾fuged at 4 °C for 5 min (1500 rpm); the lysate was then
collected. Total cellular protein concentrations were de￾termined using a BCA assay kit (Beyotime Biotechnol￾ogy, China). Equal amounts (20 μg) of protein were
separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and transferred to nitrocel￾lulose membrane for immunoblotting. Membranes were
incubated with primary antibody overnight at 4 °C and
subsequently with secondary antibodies for 2 h. The sig￾nal was detected using enhanced chemiluminescence
(Amersham Imager 600, USA).
Animal model
All animal experiments were approved by the Institu￾tional Animal Care and Use Committee of Shanghai
Jiaotong University. Four-week-old male C57 mice were
randomly divided into the pulmonary artery banding
(PAB) and sham-operated control groups [16]. Mice
were anesthetized with 2% isoflurane and performed
mechanical ventilation via a volume-controlled respir￾ator (3 mL; 45 strokes/min). Thoracotomy through the
left second intercostal region was performed and the
thymus was removed. After the pulmonary artery (PA)
was exposed, a 26-gauge needle was placed alongside it
and a 10-0 silk suture was used to secure the needle and
PA together. The needle was removed rapidly and the
vital signs were monitored. The thoracotomy was per￾formed and following by thymectomy in the sham￾operated group.

BMSC transplantation
Before stem cell injection, BMSCs were harvested at pas￾sage 3 with TrypLE Express (Gibco, Life Technologies,
Grand Island, NY) and resuspended in PBS. Mice were
anesthetized with 2% isoflurane as previously described.
Ten minutes after the PAB operation, mice underwent
stem cell (n = 5, 1 × 106 BMSCs in 30 μL) or placebo
(n = 5, PBS 30 μL) injection to the RV myocardium using
insulin syringes. Weight-based dose of BMSCs was used
according to the previous dose-escalation study [17].
Echocardiography
To evaluate heart function, echocardiography was per￾formed on PAB and sham mice 4 weeks after surgery.
Transthoracic echocardiography was performed using a
Vevo 2100 digital high-frequency ultrasound system
(FujiFilm Visualsonics, Toronto, ON, Canada, http://
www.visualsonics.com) equipped with a probe (MS250)
suited for mice imaging. Mean and peak PA gradient,
right ventricular internal diameter (RVID), and RV free
wall thickness were measured in the two-dimensional
long-axis parasternal view by M-mode.
Histology
Mice were sacrificed at 4 weeks after PAB and cell injec￾tions. Heart samples were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde,
dehydrated, and embedded in paraffin. Sections (7 μm)
were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). Images
(× 1.25 and × 200) were taken from each heart, and the
diameter and measurements of RV wall thickness were
analyzed. Immunohistochemical staining with α smooth
muscle actin (α-SMA) antibody (Boster Biological Tech￾nology, Wuhan, China), CD31 (Servicebio, GB13428),
and collagen IV (abcam, ab6586) were also performed to
evaluate vascular density [18]. Vascular density was eval￾uated by counting the number of α-SMA, CD31, and
coll IV positive small vessels at a magnification of × 200
in the free wall of right ventricle. The determination of
fibrosis was showed by Masson staining, which results in
fibrotic (collagen-enriched) areas appearing blue and cel￾lular elements appearing red.
Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction
In brief, total RNA samples were extracted from cul￾tured hBMSCs at passage 3 using Trizol reagent (Invi￾trogen). For detecting the secretion of VEGF, VEGF
receptor (VEGFR) 1 and 2, protein kinase G 1 (PKG1),
and MMP-9, the mRNA was extracted from RV tissue in
three groups. RNA was reverse-transcribed with reverse
transcriptase (Takara) following DNase I treatment at
21 °C for 10 min. The quantitative real-time PCR was
performed on a ABI 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR system
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The data were
analyzed by control values from glyceraldehyde-3-
phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH).
Statistics
All statistical analyses were performed with GraphPad
Prism 7.03 software (GraphPad Software, Inc., San
Diego, California). The t test and one-way or two-way
ANOVAs were used to analyze statistical significance.
Data are expressed as the means ± SEM. A p value <
0.05 was considered statistically significant. The number
of asterisks indicates the significance level: *p < 0.05.
Results
Morphological appearance and immunophenotypic
analysis of BMSCs
BMSCs were isolated from the bone marrow using dens￾ity gradient centrifugation and cultured at 37 °C in 5%
CO2. Cells at passage P0 demonstrated a fibroblast-like,
spindle-shaped morphology (Fig. 1a) and adherence to
plastic (Fig. 1b). The size of cells from different groups
was not significantly different. Cell surface markers were
analyzed by flow cytometry. The cell surface antigens
composed of antibodies to both hematopoietic and non￾hematopoietic lineage proteins for the BMSC
characterization were detected. They expressed CD34,
CD44, and CD105 but were negative for typical lympho￾cytic markers CD45 (Fig. 1c). No difference was ob￾served in the surface markers of BMSCs between
different groups.
Migratory ability was decreased in aging BMSCs
Next, we investigated whether BMSCs from the three
groups exhibited different migration abilities by per￾forming Transwell and scratch wound healing assays.
The results show that as BMSCs aged, there was a re￾duction in the number of cells that cross over the filter
in the Transwell assay (Fig. 2g–j), which was confirmed
by the results from the scratch wound healing assay
(Fig. 2a–f, k).
BMSCs from neonate donors increased the expression of
VEGF
We further examined the expression of cytokines includ￾ing VEGF, HGF, and Hsp70 in BMSCs from different
age groups. Western blotting showed that the expression
of VEGF was significantly augmented in neonate BMSCs
compared to that from infant and child BMSCs, while
no difference between HGF and Hsp70 expression was
observed (Fig. 3a). As expected, the result was further
confirmed by PCR (Fig. 3b). Younger BMSCs produced
significantly higher levels of VEGF compared to the in￾fant and child BMSCs. No difference in HGF and Hsp70
gene expression or secreted protein level was observed
among the three groups.

BMSCs attenuated PAB-induced hypertrophy
There was no operative death. Two mice suffered
from pericardial effusion after the stem cell injection.
Mean (11.59 ± 0.533 vs 0.35 ± 0.1 mmHg, PAB vs
sham-operated; P < 0.001) and peak PA gradient
(33.60 ± 1.09 vs 1.54 ± 0.39 mmHg; P < 0.001) in the
PAB group were significantly increased compared to
that of sham-operated animals (Fig. 4a). The PAB￾induced hypertrophic effect was described as thicker
RV wall and augmented RVID. This effect was atten￾uated by pretreatment with myocardium injection of
neonate BMSCs, which also reduced the increase in
RV wall thickness (0.142 ± 0.021 in sham, 0.785 ±
0.032 mm in PAB + placebo, and 0.511 ± 0.028 mm in
PAB + BMSCs, P < 0.01) as well as RVID (0.806 ±
0.062 mm in sham, 2.389 ± 0.182 mm in PAB + pla￾cebo, and 0.847 ± 0.058 mm in PAB + BMSCs, P <
0.01) (Fig. 4b, c). Hearts were harvested 4 weeks after
operation and treatments, and histological analysis
confirmed that the hypertrophic effect can be pre￾vented by myocardium injection of BMSCs (H&E,
Fig. 5a). The arteriole density moderately increased
after PAB surgery, compared to that of sham￾operated mice. The increase was enhanced by the ad￾ministration of BMSCs, which indicated incremental
angiogenesis (Fig. 5b–d). The fibrosis increasing after
PAB surgery, which was blocked in PAB and BMSCs
group, confirming by high power field of H&E stain￾ing and Masson staining (Fig. 6a–c). Total collagen,
which was determined by Masson staining, consist￾ently elevated in the placebo group but remained at a
normal level in neonatal hBMSC injected group
(Fig. 6b, c).
Association of VEGF signaling pathway in attenuating the
hypertrophic effect
Cardiac hypertrophy can be prevented by triggering
cytokine release into the anti-hypertrophic pathway,
as previously described [5, 19]. According to Zhou
et al., enhanced VEGFR-1 signaling is involved in car￾diomyocyte hypertrophy and the PKG-1 pathway is
likely to associate with VEGFR-1. VEGF is a vital

factor in formating the new vessels and re￾epithelialization. Researches have reported that the
positive feedback between MMP 9 and VEGF plays
an important role in angiogenesis [20, 21]. It is re￾ported that the VEGF and MMP 9 enhibit angiogen￾esis during the endometrium injury. By western
blotting analysis, the VEGF and MMP 9 express sig￾nificantly higher in the neonatal BMSC group (Fig. 7a).
Thus, mRNA was extracted from RV tissue in the
three groups and processed by PCR using standard
protocols. The mRNA of MMP 9 were downregula￾tion after the PAB surgery though not significantly,
while the expression in the BMSC transplantation
group increased (Fig. 7b). The PCR results also
showed that VEGF, VEGFR-1 and 2, and PKG-1
(PRKG1) were higher in the PAB with the hBMSC in￾jection group, compared to that in the PAB with pla￾cebo treatment or sham-operation groups (Fig. 7c).

Discussion
In this study, we investigated the characteristics of
BMSCs from different age groups and found a stronger
capacity for migration and proliferation, and higher se￾cretion of VEGF in the younger group. PAB-induced
hypertrophy was prevented by neonatal BMSC trans￾plantation in the RV wall, which was revealed by a re￾duction in RV thickness and RVID.
An age-related decline in expression of cytokines,
BMSC proliferation, and activity seems to occur in dif￾ferent species, which probably limits its application to
heart diseases. Upon aging, imbalanced BMSC differenti￾ation, vascular remodeling, changes in adrenergic signal￾ing, and inflammation influence coordinately and
dynamically the stem cell and present a potential thera￾peutic target for age-related pathological disorders [22].
Aging characteristic compared in other studies including
in vitro differentiation capacity, immunological markers,
and global gene expression, which did not describe de￾tailedly in this study. In this study, the age-related
changes in BMSC characterization were dramatic despite
the small age interval. Firstly, older BMSCs were associ￾ated with a significant reduction in the migration and
proliferation capacity, and the dynamic expression of
MMP 9 might responsible for the migration [23]. Ac￾cording to Wei et al., the exact mechanisms underlying
BMSC migration capability are partly investigated and
MMP 9 upregulation augmented the stem cells’ invasive
capacity. Secondly, further experiments demonstrated
that cytokine VEGF secretion was higher in neonate
BMSCs than that from infants and children, which was
supported by evaluation of VEGF gene expression, which
is comparable to other studies [12, 24]. VEGF is a critical
angiogenic factor which is associated with neovasculari￾zation, myocardial protection, and induction of anti￾hypertrophic pathway signaling [5, 25]. In a previous
study, after intracardiac injection of VEGF, heart func￾tion was improved and cardiomyocyte apoptosis was
inhibited [9]. It was reported that the expression of
many heat shock proteins was found to decline progres￾sively with age in BMSCs from young (< 5 years old),
middle-aged (8–10 years old), and old (> 12 years old)
rhesus monkeys [26]. According to our data, gene ex￾pression of HGF and Hsp70 did not decrease in BMSCs
isolated from older patients. The potential reason that
similar results were absent in our study is because the
juvenile BMSCs in this present study were isolated from
a narrow range age in which the HGF and Hsp70 are
not as susceptible to change as VEGF. These changes
may have important consequences on myocardial heal￾ing mediated by BMSCs. The paracrine effects of BMSCs
might intimately relate to its therapeutic potential to
mice cardiac hypertrophy. Therefore, we suggest that
BMSCs from neonates probably hold the largest poten￾tial for therapeutic effect and may present an optimal
choice for stem cell treatment.
Although heart transplantation remains the surgical
strategy for pediatric heart failure, the transplantation
list for neonates and infants is long and the survival rate
is still poor, making the therapy a rough task [27]. There
are some studies demonstrated that stem cell delivery to
children’s diseased hearts as an adjunct to surgical

palliation provided some benefits in terms of cardiac
function, somatic growth, and quality of life [7, 28].
Intramyocardial delivery of stem cells can produce
higher cell retention as well as a targeted approach into
the damaged myocardium [29]. Intramyocardial injection
of mesenchymal stem cells in an RV pressure overload
model preserved the RV function and attenuated cardiac
remodeling [30]. There have also been several clinical
studies applying mesenchymal stem cells on patients
with hypoplastic left heart syndrome, which showed im￾provement of ventricular function, an increase in RV
ejection fraction, and a marked decrease in brain natri￾uretic peptide [31–33]. However, the stem cell-based
therapy remains controversial since there are disagree￾ments regarding the therapeutic effect of stem cell injec￾tion for its inconclusive efficacy and clinical probability
[34]. In our research, the hypertrophic RV model was
established as previously described, significantly increas￾ing the mean and peak PA gradient as well as the RV
thickness at 4 weeks post-operation. Four weeks after
placebo and neonatal BMSCs injection, echocardiog￾raphy showed a significant decline in RV thickness and
RVID by BMSC intervention, which was further sup￾ported by histological results. The mice that developed
pericardial effusion may attribute to the rejection of hu￾man BMSCs in the murine model. Previous studies

showed an extremely low retention rate in the hearts,
which may cause limited outcomes [35]. Although we
failed to locate the stem cells in the myocardium, a re￾duction in RV wall and RVID was observed and an in￾crease in VEGF secretion was detected. The expression
level of VEGF in the BMSC injection group was signifi￾cantly higher than those in the control and placebo in￾jection groups. Additionally, the enhancement of VEGF
by BMSCs probably contributed to the blockade of car￾diomyocyte hypertrophy. Briefly, treatment with the
youngest BMSC improved cardiac function in PA over￾load mice, and the VEGF signaling pathway is probably
associated with its beneficial effects.
Physiologic RVH improves cardiac performance in indi￾viduals; however, the persistence of the physiologic effects
lays extra burden on the ventricles and readily transits to
heart failure. In this research, cardiac fibrosis increased
dramatically after PAB but reversed by BMSC injection.
The expression of MMP 9 upregulated after BMSCs injec￾tion, which may not only affect the migration but also re￾construct the extracellular matrix [36]. The angiogenic
factor interacts with VEGF since the embryo periods have
a positive feedback linking to revascularization. Thus, we
suggested BMSC injection caused beneficial effects in alle￾viating cardiac hypertrophy by paracrine cytokine and
VEGF expression might be the most important part.

Researches have focused on the mechanism of hyper￾trophy and the anti-hypertrophic pathway, including
cytokine cardiotrophin 1, growth hormone-releasing
hormones, Kv4.2 mRNA expression upregulated by basic
fibroblast growth factor, and the VEGF signaling path￾way [19, 37, 38]. According to a previous study, the re￾gression of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy was related to a
VEGF-dependent signaling pathway, which was also
linked to PKG-1 activation [5]. Similar to other studies,
we showed that the expression of VEGF, VEGFR-1,
VEGFR-2, and PKG-1 was increased in the BMSCs treat￾ment group compared to that of the control group after
PAB. The anti-hypertrophic pathway was triggered by
VEGF mediated by VEGFR-1, whose activation is linked
to the PKG-1 signaling pathway [39]. Although still un￾clear, BMSCs in the myocardium of mice probably mi￾grated to a particular area and promoted paracrine
secretion, including the robust VEGF expression, leading
to cardiac function preservation as well as angiogenesis.
Moreover, VEGF maintained myocardial capillary dens￾ity and its reductions in the vascular bed were associated
with compensatory hypertrophy to heart failure [40].
Bajgelman et al. demonstrated that the application of the
VEGF gene in rats revealed significantly improved car￾diac function by reversal of capillary rarefaction [41].
Our results showed that the enhancement of neovascu￾larization in BMSC administration was related to the
normalization of RV wall thickness in PA overload mice.
Briefly, we report that VEGF might preserve cardiac
function through the anti-hypertrophic signal pathway
and enhancement of angiogenesis; however, further ex￾periments are warranted [42].
Limitations
It is important to expand the age range of patients for
the determination of different characteristics in BMSCs.
However, all the bone marrow samples come from chil￾dren’s hospital that underwent thoracic surgery, making
the age range narrow. Further researches will involve
adult patients, which covered the whole age range and
thoroughly demonstrated general effect on aging
BMSCs. Meanwhile, we compared the different charac￾teristics from three age groups and found out the neo￾natal BMSCs might have the largest potential in cell
therapy. The comparison among BMSCs from three in￾jection groups into PAB mice has not been revealed for
the following reasons. Firstly, the average weight of pre￾operative and postoperative (4 weeks later) mice was 9 ±
2 and 19 ± 3 g, respectively, resulting quite tiny hearts.
Secondly, the heart rhythm of mice in this study ranges
from 350 to 450 bpm, which makes the cells suspension
or placebo injection difficult, and resulting high postop￾erative mortality. Larger range of cells injection was sub￾jected to technique difficulties. Besides, we failed to
locate injected stem cell in the myocardium, which re￾sulted in insufficient evidences in location, distribution,
and survival of hBMSCs after injection. The lower reten￾tion of stem cells in the myocardium and injected diffi￾culty attributed to that. Further researches might include
more appropriate animals for injection of stem cells
from whole age range. Though we suggested VEGF and
the signal pathway contribute to the blockage of hyper￾trophy, further experiments are warranted for thorough
and detailed evaluation of the VEGF signal pathway.
Conclusions
In conclusion, human BMSCs from different age groups
possess different characteristics, and the youngest
BMSCs have a favorable impact on the application of
stem cell-based therapy using intramyocardial injections
on overpressure-induced RV hypertrophy. These valu￾able findings encourage us to build a neonate stem cell
bank that provides potential grafts for stem cell trans￾plantation in the treatment of cardiac disorders.
