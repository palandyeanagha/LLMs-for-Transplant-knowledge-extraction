Abstract
Objective: Vascular calcification is a common pathobiological process which occurs among the elder population and
in patients with diabetes and chronic kidney disease. Osteoprotegerin, a secreted glycoprotein that regulates bone
mass, has recently emerged as an important regulator of the development of vascular calcification. However, the
mechanism is not fully understood. The purpose of this study is to explore novel signaling mechanisms of
osteoprotegerin in the osteoblastic differentiation in rat aortic vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs).
Methods and Results: VSMCs were isolated from thoracic aorta of Sprague Dawley rats. Osteoblastic differentiation
of VSMCs was induced by an osteogenic medium. We confirmed by Von Kossa staining and direct cellular calcium
measurement that mineralization was significantly increased in VSMCs cultured in osteogenic medium; consistent
with an enhanced alkaline phosphatase activity. This osteoblastic differentiation in VSMCs was significantly reduced
by the addition of osteoprotegerin in a dose responsive manner. Moreover, we identified, by real-time qPCR and
western blotting, that expression of Notch1 and RBP-Jκ were significantly up-regulated in VSMCs cultured in
osteogenic medium at both the mRNA and protein levels, these effects were dose-dependently abolished by the
treatment of osteoprotegerin. Furthermore, we identified that Msx2, a downstream target of the Notch1/RBP-Jκ
signaling, was markedly down-regulated by the treatment of osteoprotegerin.
Conclusion: Osteoprotegerin inhibits vascular calcification through the down regulation of the Notch1-RBP-Jκ
signaling pathway.

Introduction
Vascular calcification is a common pathological process [1]
which is observed extensively in patients with renal disease [2]
and type II diabetes [3] as well as in aging populations [4–6].
Although the clinical significance of vascular calcification is
well-recognized [6], the mechanisms involved are still not clear.
It is accepted that plasticity and phenotypic modulation of
vascular smooth muscle cells play a pivotal role in the
development of vasculature calcification [5,7,8].
Osteoprotegerin (OPG), also known as osteoclastogenesis
inhibitory factor [OCIF] or the tumor necrosis factor (TNF)
receptor-like molecule[TR1], a member of the TNF family of
receptors, is a secreted protein that regulates bone mass by
inhibiting osteoclast differentiation and activation [9]. OPG￾deficient mice exhibited a decrease in total bone density as
well as a high incidence of fractures [9,10], and also developed
calcified lesions in the aorta and renal arteries [9,11]. However,
the vascular calcification would be negligent in this mouse if
recombinant OPG protein was supplied with in the embryonic
period. These results suggest that OPG acts as an important
inhibitor of the development of vascular calcification. However,
the molecular signaling pathway of OPG mediated vascular
calcification is not completely understood.
Notch is a family of transmembrane proteins that is only
found in Metazoans or animals. Notch exists at the cell surface
in heterodimeric form (cleaved by furin in the rans-Golgi) or as
an intact (colinear) protein. 4 mammalian Notch receptors
(Notch-1 to Notch-4) corresponding with at least five ligands
termed Jagged 1, Jagged 2, Delta -1, Delta -2, Delta -3 were

found [12]. The interaction of Notch with a ligand results in the
extracellular processing of the Notch receptor by a disintegrin￾metalloprotease that releases the intracellular domain of Notch
to the nucleus and facilitates an association with the
transcription factor RBP-Jκ (also known as CBF-1 or CSL). The
subsequent recruitment of the coactivator, mastermind-like
(MAML) protein, promotes transcriptional activation of
downstream effectors [13]. It is shown that Notch receptors
play a role in controlling the human VSMC phenotype and
repressing VSMC differentiation in a RBP-Jκ-dependent
manner in vitro [12,14]. Recent studies showed that Notch1-
RBP-Jκ signaling pathway is involved both in phenotypic
modulation of VSMCs and osteo/chondrogenesis [15].
Therefore, in the present study, we performed an in vitro
study to test our hypothesis that OPG inhibits the development
of vascular calcification by inhibiting the Notch1-RBP-Jκ
signaling pathway. By using Von Kossa staining, we found that
that OPG markedly inhibits the osteoblastic differentiation of
VSMCs which is further confirmed by the Alkaline Phosphatase
(ALP) Assay and calcium content measurement. Furthermore,
we identified that OPG significantly down regulated the Notch1-
RBP-Jκ signaling pathway and its downstream target MSX2.
Materials and Methods
1: Cell Culture and treatments
Primary vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) were
isolated from the descending thoracic aorta of Sprague Dawley
(SD) rats (4 weeks old, male) as described previously [16]. The
protocol was approved by the Institute Animal Care and Use
committee of Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of
Science and Technology, Wuhan, China (Permit Number:
SYXY2010-0057). The study was carried out in strict
accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the
Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the Experimental
Animals Management Committee (Hubei Province, China). All
animals were sacrificed under anesthesia to minimize suffering.
Briefly, rats were sacrificed under anesthesia with
intraperitoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital (120 mg/kg).
The thoracic aorta was isolated and washed in PBS three
times. All external fat and connective tissue were detached and
the adventitia and endothelial layer were carefully removed.
Strips of media were incubated with Dulbecco’s modified
Eagle’s medium (DMEM) with 20% FBS (Cell applications,
Inc.). Confirmation of the phenotype was obtained by
fluorescent immunostaining for α-smooth muscle actin. Cells
were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium
(DMEM) with 10% FBS, 100U/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml
streptomycin and were incubated in 75 cm2
 tissue culture flasks
at a density of 1×104
 cells/ml. VSMCs at passage 5 to 6 were
used for the experiments of this study.
Osteoblastic differentiation was induced by culturing cells in
an osteogenic medium, containing 50 mg/ml ascorbate-2-
phosphate and 10mM β-glycerol phosphate. DMEM was used
as culture control. N-[N-(3,5-Difluorophenacetyl) -L-alanyl]-S￾phenylglycinet-butyl ester (DAPT) (10mM), a known potent
inhibitor of the Notch1-RBP-Jκ dependent signaling pathway,
was used as a positive control. VSMCs were also cultured in
the presence of different concentrations of OPG (0.1, 1, and
10ng/ml). After 14 day treatments, cultured VSMCs were
submitted to the following experiments. A total of six groups
were included in this study: control (VSMC cultured with
DMEM); osteogenic (OS) group (VSMC cultured with
osteogenic medium only); DAPT group (VSMC cultured with
OS and DAPT); OPG groups (VSMC cultured with OS and
OPG), which are divided into three subgroups due to the
different concentration of OPG (0.1, 1, and 10ng/ml).
2: Von Kossa Staining
Calcium deposition in cultured VSMCs was investigated
using Von Kossa staining as previously described [17]. VSMCs
in culture flasks were washed 3 times with PBS, followed by a
fixation with 4% paraformalclehyde for 15 min. The cells were
then washed 3 times with distilled water and incubated with 5%
silver nitrate solution and exposed to bright sunlight for 30 min,
then washed with distilled water for 5min, and treated with 5%
sodium thiosulfate for 2min. Calcium particles were observed in
visual fields at a magnification of ×40.
3: Measurement of intracellular calcium content
The cultures were decalcified with 0.6 N HCl for 24 h. After
decalcification, the cells were washed with PBS and solubilized
with 0.1 N NaOH-0.1% SDS. The calcium content of the HCl
supernatant was determined by the ocresolphthalein
Complexone method (calcium kit, NanJingJian-Cheng
Bioengineering Institute). The cell number is normalized by
protein amount of VSMCs.
4: Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP) Assay
ALP activity of VSMCs was measured using Lab Assay ALP
(kit) (NanJing-JianCheng Bioengineering Institute), according
to the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, cultured cells are
washed with PBS and lysed in 0.5 mL 0.2% Triton X-100 in
distilled water by shaking for 20 min at room temperature. p￾nitrophenyl phosphate that is hydrolyzed by ALP into a yellow
colored product was detected (maximal absorbance at 405nm).
The rate of the reaction was directly proportional to the enzyme
activity. The cell number was normalized by protein amount of
VSMCs.
5: Real-time quantitative PCR
Total RNA was isolated from the cultured VSMCs using
Trizol chloroform method reagent according to the
manufacturer’s instructions (Invitrogen, USA) and reverse
transcribed into cDNA with a Toyoba reverse transcription kit
(Fermentas, Canada). The real-time quantitative PCR was
carried out with the ABI PRISM 7900 sequence detector
system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Canada) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. The β-actin was used as
endogenous control. PCR reaction mixture contained the
SYBR Green/Fluorescein QPCR Master Mix (2X) (Fermentas,
Canada), cDNA, and the primers. Relative gene expression
level (the amount of target, normalized to endogenous control
gene) was calculated using the comparative Ct method formula

6: Western blotting analysis
Protein was extracted from cultured VSMCs in radio
immunoprecipitation assay buffer (RIPA), containing 50mM
Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1%
Triton X-100 in the presence of aprotinin, PMSF, okadaic acid,
and leupeptin. Total protein (50 µg) per sample was loaded
onto 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and separated at 100 V
followed by transfer to PVDF at 200mA. Membranes were
blocked in 5% non-fat milk in 0.1M PBS, pH 7.4 at room
temperature for 2h and then incubated with primary antibodies:
goat anti-Notch1 polyclonal antibody (1:400) (Santa, USA), or
rabbit anti-RBP-Jκ polyclonal antibody (1:300) (Santa, USA) or
goat anti-Msx2 polyclonal antibody (1:400) (Santa, USA). After
washing, membranes were incubated in HRP conjugated
rabbit-anti-goat or goat-anti-rabbit secondary antibody
(1:40000) for 2 hours at room temperature followed by washing
and 5 min incubation with ECL reagents. The membranes were
stripped and equal protein loading was determined by GAPDH
expression using a mouse monoclonal antibody (1:75,000).
7: Statistical analysis
The results are shown as mean± SE. The significance of
differences was estimated by ANOVA followed by Student￾Newmann-Keuls multiple comparison tests. P≤0.05 was
considered statistically significant. All statistical analyses were
performed using SPSS soft-ware (version 17.0, SPSS Inc.,
Chicago, IL).
Results
1: OPG inhibits osteoblastic differentiation of VSMCs
To determine the effect of OPG on osteoblastic
differentiation of VSMCs, Von Kossa staining was used to
detect calcium deposition in VSMCs. As showed in Figure 1A,
calcium particles were not detected in VSMCs cultured in
control DMEM medium, while positively-staining particles
(black as showed by arrows) were significantly increased in
VSMCs cultured in osteogenic medium (Figure 1B), indicating
an increase of osteoblastic differentiation in these VSMCs. The
increase of osteoblastic differentiation was significantly
reduced by the treatment of DAPT, a gamma secretase
inhibitor that abrogates Notch signaling by interrupting
cleavage of Notch intracellular domain upon ligand stimulation,
(Figure 1C). Importantly, this enhanced calcium deposition was
also markedly reduced in the presence of OPG in a dose￾dependent manner (Figure 1D to 1F) compared with VSMCs
cultured in osteogenic medium only (Figure 1B). This indicates
that OPG, similar to DAPT, repressed the osteoblastic
differentiation of VSMCs induced by osteogenic media (Figure
1). These observations were further confirmed by the
quantitative measurement of the cellular calcium content. As
shown in Figure 1G, the cellular calcium content was increased
by 5 fold in VSMCs cultured in osteogenic medium compared
to the control (p<0.05). We also showed that OPG reduced the
calcium deposition in VSMCs induced by osteogenic
stimulation by 20 to 60% in a dose dependent manner (p<0.05,
compared to VSMCs cultured in osteogenic medium). These
observations together indicate the OPG plays an important role
in the regulation of the osteoblastic differentiation of VSMC.
2: ALP Assay in VSMCs treated with OPG
ALP activity, an early marker of osteogenic conversion, was
determined in cultured VSMCs. As shown in Figure 2, ALP
activity was significantly increased by 3.5 fold in VSMCs in
osteogenic media compared to the control (p<0.05), confirming

dependent manner (p<0.05, compared to VSMCs cultured in
osteogenic medium). These observations together indicate the

an osteogenic conversion in the VSMCs. The enhanced ALP
activity induced by osteogenic medium was repressed
significantly by 30% with the addition of DAPT and also
significantly reduced by OPG dose dependently (p<0.05 versus
the osteogenic VSMCs). These results are consistent with the
reduced calcium deposition observed in VSMCs in the
presence of OPG presented in Figure 1, which further confirms
the inhibitive effects of OPG on the osteogenic conversion of
VSMCs.
3: OPG down regulates the Notch1-RBP-Jκ-dependent
signaling pathway
Rat aortic VSMCs were treated with different media as
described in the Methods. mRNA and protein levels of Notch1
and RBP-Jκ in VSMC were measured by real-time RT-PCR
and Western blotting. As shown in Figure 3, Notch1 and RBP￾Jκ were significantly increased by 3 to 4 fold in VSMCs cultured
in osteogenic medium compared to the control at both the
mRNA and protein levels (*P<0.05 vs control), suggesting that
the Notch1-RBP-Jκ signaling pathway is activated in the
osteogenic conversion of VSMCs (Figure 3).
To determine the effects of OPG on the expression of the
Notch1-RBP-Jκ dependent signaling pathway in VSMCs, three
different concentrations (0.1ng/l, 1ng/l and 10ng/l) of OPG was
added to VSMCs cultured in osteogenic media, and the DAPT
was added as a positive control of inhibition of the Notch1--
RBP-Jκ-dependent signaling pathway. Our data showed that
DAPT reduced the expression of Notch1 by 50% and RBP-Jκ
by 30% in VSMCs compared to osteogenic cells at both the
mRNA and protein levels. Similarly, OPG reduced the
expression of Notch1 and RBP-Jκ compared to VSMCs in
osteogenic medium in a dose dependent manner (#. P<0.05,
compared to osteogenic VSMCs (Os group)), indicating its
inhibitive effect on the Notch1--RBP-Jκ-signaling pathway.
4: OPG represses downstream target of Notch1-RBP￾Jκ-signaling pathway in VSMCs
Next, we tested whether inhibition of the Notch1-RBP-Jκ￾signaling pathway affected the downstream target gene Msx2.
As showed in Figure 4, the expression of Msx2 was
significantly increased in osteogenic medium by 3 to 4 fold
compared with the control at both mRNA and protein levels
(*P<0.05), which corresponded with an increase of Notch1 and
RBP-Jκ. To test whether up-regulation of Msx2 by osteogenic
media is Notch1-RBP-Jκdependent, DAPT was added. The
results in Figure 4 show that the activation of Msx2 by
osteogenic media was significantly diminished by the addition
of DAPT (P<0.05 compared to VSMCs cultured in osteogenic

from different media. ALP activity was significantly increased by 3.5 folds in VSMCs treated with osteogenic media compared to the

repressed significantly by 30% with the addition of DAPT and also significantly reduced by OPG dose dependently. *, P<0.05 vs

media), which is consistent with the inhibition of the expression
of Notch1-RBP-Jκ (Figure 3). This further confirms that the
osteoblastic differentiation of VSMCs induced by osteogenic
medium is mediated by Notch1-RBP-Jκ signaling. Importantly,
we observed that addition of OPG significantly reduced the
expression of Msx2 in a dose dependent manner, indicating
that OPG represses expression of Msx2 through the
suppression of the Notch1-RBP-Jκ-signaling pathway.
Discussion
Despite the fact that OPG has been proven to participate in
multiple aspects of vascular calcification [15,17], the molecular
mechanism(s) underlying its function remains exclusive.
Whereas previous work has focused on the investigation of
OPG on the osteoclastogensis in osteoclast development, our
current study focused on the regulation of OPG on osteoblastic
differentiation of VSMCs and the signaling pathway involved in
this function. Our results show that not only is OPG an
important inhibitor of osteoblastic conversion in VSMCs, but
that it also inhibits VSMC calcification by blocking the Notch1-
RBP-Jκ-dependent signaling pathway. These findings provide

solid evidences implicating OPG as a key regulator of rat aortic
calcification.
Osteoprotegerin (OPG) is a soluble glycoprotein which
belongs to a member of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor
super family which was initially found in bone [18], but is also
found in various other tissues like arterial wall [19,20]. OPG
has been linked to diabetes mellitus, silent myocardial
ischemia, acute myocardial infarction, and left ventricular
dysfunction [21]. The tissue concentration of OPG in aorta and
hip-bone is almost identical but 500 times higher than the
plasma concentration [22]. OPG exerts its function through
binding and neutralizing the receptor activator for nuclear factor
kappa B (NF-κB) lignad (RANKL) [23]. In bone, OPG inhibits
bone resorption, whereas RANKL promotes bone resorption.
Although the function of OPG in arterial wall is not fully known,
it has been reported that, contrary to their action in bone, OPG
exerts a protective effect on the calcification in the vasculature
[24]. This observation was further supported by the study in
OPG knockout mouse model, where it has been shown that
targeted deletion of OPG in mice results in severe, early-onset
osteoporosis, and the calcification of the aorta and renal
arteries [10]. OPG was found to inhibit vascular calcification
induced by warfarin and vitamin D3 in vivo [25]. These findings
suggest that OPG plays an important role in osteoporosis and
vascular calcification. Therefore, OPG may act as a potential
inhibitor of the development of vascular calcification. In the
present study, we focused on aortic vascular smooth muscle
cells, a major component of aortic wall, to determine the effect
of OPG on the osteogenic conversion of VSMCs. We first

dependent manner, indicating that OPG represses expression
of Msx2 through the reduction of the Notch1-RBP-Jκ-signaling
pathway. *, P<0.05 vs control, #, P<0.05 vs osteogenic

identified that osteoblastic differentiation of VSMCs was
induced by osteogenic medium which was confirmed by an
increase of calcium deposition and ALP activity, a significant
marker for osteogenic differentiation, Furthermore, we
identified that OPG significantly inhibited the osteogenic
conversion of VSMCs in vitro in a dose dependent manner,
indicating that repression of osteoblastic differentiation of
VSMCs may be a crucial cellular mechanism of the inhibition of
vascular calcification by OPG (Figures 1 and 2).
Although experimental evidence indicates that OPG may
serve as a vascular calcification inhibitor, emerging clinical
observations demonstrated that serum OPG positively
correlated with incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and
mortality in elders [26–35]. Clinical research also showed that
OPG levels are significantly higher in patients with chronic
kidney disease (CKD) compared with age- and sex-matched
controls, and increasing OPG levels have a linear relationship
with adverse renal function [36–39]. Elevated OPG is
associated with all-cause mortality in CKD stage 4 and 5
patients in addition to vascular calcification [40]. However, it is
not clear whether the elevated serum OPG level is along the
causal pathway in the development of these diseases or rather
serves as a marker of disease burden. Animal models and
experimental data showing that OPG has a rather protective
effect against vascular calcification implies that higher OPG
levels in patients with CVD and CKD might be a compensatory
response to these diseases, rather than a risk factor. Rapid
decline in serum OPG levels in these patients after renal and
cardiac transplantations [41,42] support the notion that
increased serum OPG is a modulatory response to CVD and
CKD. With very high concentrations in normal arterial wall, it is
likely that the level of OPG in circulating blood reflects arterial
content to some degree. It is moreover plausible that increased
circulating levels may reflect injury to the arterial wall, putatively
as result of the influence of pro-inflammatory molecules on
arterial cells [24]. However, there is no direct evidence showing
inhibitory effect of OPG in the vascular calcifications. In
addition, although it has been shown that OPG knockout mice
develop vascular calcification [10], it is unidentified whether
vascular calcification displayed in OPG knockout mice is due to
the preliminary effects of OPG or due to secondary effects
initiated by circulating bone degradation product. Our results in
the present study provide direct evidence for the inhibitory
effect of OPG on vascular calcification of VSMCs. Importantly,
we found that osteoblastic differentiation of VSMCs induced by
osteogenic medium was also blocked by DAPT, a specific
inhibitor of Notch signaling pathway (Figures 1 and 2), implying
that this pathway may be involved in the mechanism of OPG in
the regulation of osteoblastic conversion of VSMCs. Therefore
our second goal is to determine the effect of OPG on the Notch
signaling pathway.
It is known that the Notch signaling pathway plays a key role
in the differentiation of many tissues [14,43,44]. It is an
evolutionarily conserved pathway that is a critical determinant
of the cell fate [45] and adult tissue renewal. Attenuated Notch
signaling profoundly enhances osteoclastogenesis and bone
resorption in vitro and in vivo by a combination of molecular
mechanisms. Recent studies showed that the Notch1 signaling
pathway induces osteogenic differentiation and mineralization
of VSMCs [14] and inhibiting the Notch1 signaling pathway
suppresses calcification of aortic valve [44,46]. These findings
combined with our results shown above indicate a potential
regulatory function exerted by OPG and the Notch1 signaling
pathway in the regulation of osteogenic conversion of VSMCs.
Although different Notch signaling pathways were found in
various tissues, recent studies showed that Notch-RBP-Jκ
MSX2 signaling pathway plays an important role in vascular
calcification, not only due to the finding of the colocalization of
notch1 and Msx2 in human fibrocalcific plaques, but also due
to the direct evidence showing that Notch signaling promotes
osteogenic differentiation and mineralization of VSMCs by
directly activation Msx2 gene transcription via RBP-Jκ
13. RBP￾Jκ, a major mediator of Notch signaling, binds with notch
intercellular domains (NICD) and forms a complex that further
activates transcription of target genes from its cognate DNA
binding sequence in the nucleus. Msx2, a key osteogenic
regulatory factor of vascular calcification, is the downstream
target gene of Notch1-RBP-Jκ-dependent signaling pathway
[47,48]. It is confirmed that Msx2 mediated Notch1 induced
osteogenic conversion of human aortic SMCs via RBP-Jκ
13
.
The decrease of Msx2 implies the inhibition of osteogenic
differentiation of VSMCs. Our results confirmed that the
expression of Notch1 and RBP-Jκ as well as its downstream
target Msx2 were significantly increased in osteogenic VSMCs
which consist with the increased intracellular calcium
deposition. Importantly, the osteogenic effects on VSMCs
which include an increase of Msx2, and enhancement of ALP
activity as well as an increased deposition of calcium, were
significantly reduced by the addition of DAPT, a specific
inhibitor that abrogates Notch signaling by interrupting
cleavage of Notch intracellular domain upon ligand stimulation.
This implies that the Notch1-RBP-Jκ-dependent signaling
pathway contributes to the calcification of VSMCs, and that
inhibiting the Notch1-RBP-Jκ-dependent signaling pathway
represents a potential therapeutic approach for the vascular
diseases among the elderly and patients with diabetes and
chronic kidney disease. Moreover, our results in this study
have identified that OPG inhibits the intracellular calcification of
VSMCs which is induced by osteogenic medium through a
Notch1-RBP-Jκ-dependent signaling pathway (Figures 1 and
2). Importantly, we proved that OPG reduces the expression of
Notch1 and RBP-Jκ as well as its downstream target Msx2 in a
dose dependent manner (Figures 3 and 4). These facts
suggest that OPG is a negative regulator of Notch1 signaling
pathway and the inhibition of osteogenic conversion by OPG
occurs through the down regulation of Notch1-RBP-Jκ
signaling pathway. Although the mechanisms involved in this
regulation of OPG are not fully defined, one of potential
explanation is that OPG acts as a decoy receptor for the
receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANKL) in
VSMC, by binding RANKL, inhibits NF-κB, subsequently down
regulating the expression of Notch1 signaling pathway, thus
deteriorating the mineralization in VSMCs caused by the
osteogenic stimuli. However, the elucidation of this mechanism
will require further confirmation. In addition, whether
osteoprotegerin is necessary for the activation of Notch1-RBP￾Calcification of Vascular Smooth Muscle Cell

Jκ/Msx2 signaling pathway in VSMC merits additional
investigation.
It should also be noted that although our observations in the
present study indicate a strong positive association of OPG
with the inhibition of the Notch1/RBP-Jκ signaling by showing
an excellent agreement with the effect of DAPT, our results
also showed that DAPT dramatically reduced but insufficiently
abolished the VSMC calcification stimulated by osteogenic
medium, and that the reduction of the calcium content is even
greater in OPG treated VSMC compared with DAPT treated
VSMC whereas the Notch1 levels are comparable between
these two groups. These observations imply that multiple
signaling pathways may be involved in the effect of OPG on the
regulation of VSMC mineralization. For example, our previous
study found that OPG could also inhibit calcification of VSMCs
via repressing Wnt/β-catenin pathway [49,50]. However, the
relationship between these two signaling pathways is unknown
so far.
In summary, the present study confirmed that Notch1-RBP￾Jκ signaling pathway plays a crucial role in the osteogenic
differentiation of VSMCs and may become a new target or
direction for prevention and treatment of vascular calcification.
We also identified that OPG is a potential inhibitor of VSMC
calcification by targeting, at least in part, the notch1-RBP-Jκ
dependent signaling pathway resulting the reduction of its
downstream gene Msx2. In this regard, our study provides
significant novel insight into the molecular mechanism of
vascular calcification and also indicates a potential therapeutic
target for the vascular diseases. As a secreted glycoprotein,
OPG has the operational possibility as a drug that can be used
to antagonize media calcification in the future, just like
AMGN-0007 (a recombinant osteoprotegerin construct) and to
serve as a potential therapeutic agent in the treatment of bone
disease [51].
