Sinusoidal portal hypertension in hepatic
amyloidosis
E Bion, R Brenard, E A Pariente, D Lebrec, C Degott, F Maitre, J P Benhamou
Abstract
Hepatic venous catheterisation and trans￾venous liver biopsy were performed in five
patients with hepatic amyloidosis. In three
patients, hepatic venous pressures were
normal and histological examination of the
liver biopsy specimen showed discrete and
sparse perisinusoidal amyloid deposits. In the
other two, however, the gradient between
wedged and free hepatic venous pressures was
increased (12 and 16 mmHg; normal 1-4
mmHg) and amyloid deposits were abundant
and diffuse in the Disse's space. This study
shows that portal hypertension in patients with
hepatic amyloidosis is of the sinusoidal type
and is related to the reduction of vascular
space of hepatic sinusoids by massive peri￾sinusoidal amyloid deposits. Furthermore,
portal hypertension is associated with a poor
prognosis in patients with hepatic amyloidosis.
In patients with hepatic amyloidosis, hepato￾megaly and moderate abnormalities of liver
function tests are the most frequent findings.`I
Portal hypertension is an uncommon complica￾tion of this disorder and its mechanism remains
unclear. In this study, we report the results of
hepatic vein pressure measurements in five
patients with hepatic amyloidosis, two of whom
had portal hypertension. In addition, we evalu￾ated the value of the hepatic venous pressure
gradient to the degree of amyloidosis infiltration
into the liver.

detected in the serum or urine. Endoscopy
showed no oesophageal varices. Ultrasound
showed a homogeneous enlarged liver with
ascites and patent portal and hepatic veins.
Hepatic venous catheterisation and transvenous
liver biopsy were performed. Wedged and free
hepatic venous pressures were found to be 19 and
7 mmHg respectively, with a pressure gradient
of 12 mmHg (normal values, 1-4 mmHg). Right
atrial pressure was 7 mmHg. Histological
examination of the liver biopsy specimen showed
massive amyloid deposits in the Disse's space
with considerable compression atrophy of
hepatic sinusoids and hepatocytes. A rectal
biopsy specimen showed large subepithelial and
vascular deposits of amyloid. Bone marrow
biopsy tissue showed infiltration with lympho￾plasmocytoid cells bearing IgM with kappa light
chains and prominent interstitial deposits of
amyloid. Primary AL type amyloidosis with
severe liver, kidney, and bone marrow infiltra￾tion was diagnosed. Gastrointestinal bleeding
from an unknown origin occurred. The patient
died from sepsis and renal failure 15 days after
admission to hospital.
PATIENT 2
A 66 year old man was admitted to hospital on
1 July 1987 for dyspnoea oftwo months' duration
and hepatomegaly. Clinical examination showed
a firm hepatomegaly measuring 19 cm on the
right mid-clavicular line, tense ascites, ankle
oedema, distended jugular veins, and tachy￾cardia. Results of liver tests are given in Table I.
An M component (IgA lambda) was present in
the serum and lambda light chains in urine.
Proteinuria was 0-6 g/day. No oesophageal
varices were seen at endoscopy. Abdominal
ultrasound showed a homogeneous enlarged
liver with patent portal and slight dilated
hepatic veins. Cardiac ultrasound showed hyper￾trophy of the interventricular septum and the
posterior wall without ventricular dilatation and
a moderate pericardial effusion. There was no
detectable skeletal lesion on x ray examinations.
A hepatic venous catheterisation and a trans￾venous liver biopsy were performed. Wedged
and free hepatic venous pressures were 20 and
4 mmHg respectively, with a pressure gradient
of 16 mmHg. Right atrial pressure was 4 mmHg.
Histological examination of the liver biopsy
specimen showed diffuse and massive peri￾sinusoidal amyloid deposits (Fig 1). Submucosal
deposits of amyloid were found in the gastric and
duodenal biopsy specimens. Bone marrow
biopsy tissue showed infiltration with mature
plasmocytes bearing IgA with lambda light
chains and interstitial deposits of amyloid.

A 50 year old man was admitted to hospital on 5 January 1987 because of abnormal liver tests
over three months. Six months earlier he had
developed nephrotic syndrome and renal failure
due to renal amyloidosis associated with multiple
myeloma. At this time chronic haemodialysis
was started and he was treated with cyclophos￾phamide, vincristine, and prednisone every two
or three months. At hospital admission, clinical
examination showed neither hepatomegaly nor
ascites. Results of liver tests are given in Table I.

Discussion
The liver is affected in approximately 60% of
patients with amyloidosis.' 5 Portal hyperten￾sion, however, seems to be an uncommon com￾plication of this disorder. It has previously been
reported in only 12 patients with hepatic
amyloidosis (Table II).51-6 We report two
patients with portal hypertension complicating
hepatic amyloidosis. In five reported patients,
portal hypertension was present without clinical
manifestations. In two patients, oesophageal
varices were present at necropsy,68 and in two at
endoscopy.5 6 In one patient, increased portal
pressure was measured at laparotomy.'3 In seven
reported patients and in two of our patients,
gastrointestinal bleeding due to ruptured oeso￾phageal varices,7 I ascites with splenomegaly,'4
or prominent abdominal veins'2 led to the diag￾nosis of portal hypertension. In our two patients,
portal hypertension was shown by hepatic vein
catheterisation performed for transvenous liver
biopsy - transparietal liver biopsy being contra￾indicated in those patients with massive hepatic
amyloidosis. I7I I The absence of oesophageal
varices in our two patients and in two reported
patients'2 3 with hepatic amyloidosis compli￾cated by portal hypertension, may be explained
by a mild increase in portal pressure which does
not allow collateral circulation to develop. A
rapid deterioration in the patient's condition
may also contribute to the absence of the
development of oesophageal varices.
The prevalence of ascites is high in amyloido￾sis, ranging from 15 to 47%.' 2 9 In patients with
hepatic amyloidosis, ascites may be the result of
multiple causes, the commonest being hypo￾albuminaemia due to the nephrotic syndrome
and cardiac failure. The role of portal hyperten￾sion, however, was suggested by Levine, who
found ascites in 21% of patients with and in only
8% of those without hepatic amyloidosis.' Hypo￾albuminaemia in our patient 1 and cardiac failure
in patient 2 were probably associated factors for
ascites formation.
Portal hypertension in patients with hepatic
amyloidosis is of the sinusoidal type since the
gradient between wedged and free hepatic
venous pressures in our patients 1 and 2 was high
(12 and 16 mmHg respectively). Portal hyper￾tension was related to the degree of hepatic
infiltration. Sinusoidal portal hypertension is
ascribed to the reduction in the vascular space of
hepatic sinusoids by abundant and diffuse
amyloid deposits in the Disse's space and a
subsequent reduction in the sinusoidal lumen
(Fig 1). Experimental observations have sug￾gested that decreased intrahepatic vascular space
caused by hepatic resection leads to portal hyper￾tension.20 Massive amyloid deposits in the
Disse's space were found in our two patients
with portal hypertension and hepatic amyloido￾sis as well as in other previously reported
patients.5I 1-3-16 Centrilobular vein lesions, peri￾portal fibrosis, or regenerating nodules were
absent in all these patients. In our three patients
without portal hypertension, the amyloid
deposits, although also present in the Disse's
space, were, however, discrete and sparse (Fig
2). Deposition of amyloid predominates in the
Disses's space in primary amyloidosis but is
limited to walls of blood vessels in secondary
amyloidosis.3 2 The morphological differences in
the pattern of liver amyloid infiltration in
primary and secondary amyloidosis may explain
why portal hypertension developed mostly in
patients with primary amyloidosis.5-'2
Portal hypertension in patients with hepatic
amyloidosis carries a poor prognosis - of nine
patients suffering from gastrointestinal bleed￾ing5-" 1415 related to ruptured oesophageal
varices, seven died.5'7 8 10 11 14 15 Death occurred
between six days and 36 months after the recogni￾tion of hepatic involvement. Massive hepatic
amyloidosis rarely leads to fatal hepatic failure. '
In patients with amyloidosis, other factors can
lead to gastrointestinal bleeding, including
acquired clotting factor deficiencies,'7 increased
vessel permeability,8 and ulceration of the
gastrointestinal tract due to amyloid infiltra￾tion.'0 17
In conclusion, portal hypertension is an
uncommon complication of hepatic amyloidosis
and is associated with a poor prognosis. In
hepatic amyloidosis, portal hypertension is of the
sinusoidal type and is related to the reduction of
vascular space of hepatic sinusoids by massive
perisinusoidal amyloid deposits.
