(Submitted for publication April 14. 1954; accepted September 8, 1954)
We report in this paper studies on nine patients
in whom homologous kidney transplantation was
performed. A preliminary report of some of
these cases has already been made (51, 58).
All of the recipients were patients in the termi￾nal stages of severe, advanced renal failure. The
risks were fully discussed with the patients and
their families, and the uncertain outcome made
clear.
In several instances the function of the trans￾plant was maintained for a surprisingly long pe￾riod of time. All of the patients ultimately suc￾cumbed to their disease.
It was our aim in this investigation to study
the subject of homotransplantation of the human
kidney-not to offer a therapeutic procedure. We
agree with Dempster (33) that "it is quite out
of the question that kidneys should be homotrans￾planted in man just in case a permanent survival
might be obtained." Nevertheless, we felt that
this study should be undertaken for the following
reasons:
1) It is important to know if the underlying
chronic renal disease of the patient can produce
changes which are able to influence-either ad￾versely or favorably-the course of the homotrans￾plant. It is difficult to simulate human renal dis￾ease accurately in the experimental animal.
2) It has been generally accepted that the
higher an animal is in the phylogenetic scale, the
more highly developed is its ability to form anti￾bodies, and thus, presumably, to destroy homo￾grafted tissue. This thesis has recently been sup￾ported by Dempster (33). No conclusive study
of the fate of human renal homotransplants was
available, however. It seemed desirable to define
the course of these transplants, and to see how

Institutes of Health; and Eli Lilly & Company.
the rejection of the transplanted kidney in man
compared to that in lower animals.
3) It was felt that observations of the biologic
response to kidney homotransplantation in man
might yield information that could not be obtained
by animal experimentation alone. Data might be
acquired which would suggest new lines of ap￾proach to the homotransplant problem and these
could then be further evaluated at the level of the
laboratory animal.
Our results appear to indicate 1) that the dis￾ease of the patient can, under some circumstances,
influence the course of the transplant, 2) that it
is possible to perform renal homotransplants in
the human that survive and function for far longer
periods of time than those reported for any ex￾perimental animal, and 3) that the rejection of the
human homotransplant is not always comparable
to that seen in the dog.
The development of the artificial kidney (63),
more than any other single thing, led to the un￾dertaking of our study of human homotransplan￾tation at this time. A modified Kolff kidney was
constructed and put in operation at the Peter Bent
Brigham Hospital in 1949 (99). By this means
it became possible to prepare seriously ill uremic
patients for surgery, and to maintain them in the
post-operative period, so that it was feasible to
perform transplantation in the terminal stages of
chronic renal failure.
It would still not be tenable to attempt renal
homografting in the human unless every effort
were made to render the procedure as safe as pos￾sible, and to subtract nothing from whatever
renal function remained to the patient. It was
also imperative that the transplantation be per￾formed in such a way that the function and course
of the grafted kidney could be charted as accu￾rately as possible.
We chose to transplant the kidneys into the
327

thigh of the recipient for the following reasons:
1) It is preferable in a uremic patient to add a
third kidney, rather than to remove one of the re￾cipient's own kidneys and substitute a transplant;
2) It is less traumatic to place the kidney in the
thigh than in the renal fossa; 3) A skin ureteros￾tomy permits collection of urine directly from the
transplant and facilitates comparison of its func￾tion with that of the other two kidneys; 4) The
vascularity of the ureter is a good index to the
circulation of the transplant, because the blood
supply of the transplanted ureter comes entirely
from the renal vessels; 5) If the ureter sloughs,
no serious complication ensues, as it might in
intra- or retro-peritoneal locations; 6) If the trans￾planted kidney dies, or becomes seriously infected,
the complication can be detected sooner than
would be the case with a transplant in the renal
fossa, and the kidney can be removed more read￾ily; 7) It is much easier to biopsy the kidney when
it is placed in the thigh.
The location of the transplant in the thigh has
the disadvantage that the circumference of the
thigh has to be increased by skin grafting to re￾ceive the kidney without tension on the overlying
tissues. This necessitates opening up planes of
dissection which are often very vascular and
which, in the uremic patient, sometimes continue
to bleed despite strenuous measures to provide
hemostasis.
REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE
There have been a great many papers written on the
general problem of tissue homografting. Recent reviews
and bibliographies are available which cover various as￾pects of the transplantation problem (11, 39, 43, 83, 84,
92, 108, 121, 123, 126, 127, 137). No attempt will be made
here to do more than briefly summarize the more perti￾nent studies of renal homotransplantation. Reference
will be made in the discussion to certain papers which
deal with questions of immunity and transplant pathol￾ogy, and that are considered relevant to the analysis of
the cases reported in this communication.
Renal homotranisplantation in experimental aitimals
It is difficult to evaluate much of the earlier work be￾cause details of urinary secretion and composition, ex￾perimental protocol, and studies of pathology are often
wanting. The period of homograft survival is sometimes
considered to be the time of stoppage of urinary secre￾tion (accurate collections have seldom been achieved),
and sometimes the death of the animal, if bilateral
nephrectomy was carried out at, or subsequent to, the
transplantation.
Ullmann, in 1902 (128) was the first to carry out renal
auto-, homo-, and hetero-transplantation, using prosthetic
tubes to make the anastomoses. He made transplants
from one dog to another, and from a dog to a goat, plac￾ing the kidney in the neck. No details of urinary secre￾tion were published.
Carrel, in 1902 (18) developed a new technique for
vascular anastomosis, and performed several auto trans￾plants to the neck, noting that they secreted clear urine.
All transplants were ultimately destroyed by infection.
Carrel and Guthrie in 1905 (19) compared the function
of a renal homograft done three days before to the nor￾mal kidney. They found the rate of secretion to be
greater than normal, but the excretion of metabolites to
be less than normal. In 1906, the same authors devel￾oped the "patching method" for anastomosis of small
vessels (20). They made brief mention of two trans￾plants made in cats by this technique. In 1906 they
also reported an experiment in which they had trans￾planted two kidneys from one dog to aniother by an "in
mass" technique. The kidneys and surrounding tissues
were removed en masse with segments of aorta and
vena cava which were then anastomosed in continuity
to the aorta and vena cava of the host (21). Both kid￾neys of the host were removed. The urine from the
transplants was said to be within normal limits on the
8th day. The end result of this case, a 10-day survival,
was published two years later (22).
In 1908, Carrel (22) reported the results of trans￾plantation in mass of both kidneys (the host's kidneys
being removed) to 14 cats. Five died in the immediate
post-operative period. Seven of the remaining cats
died within 14 days. Two animals lived for 31 and 36
days, respectively. The first of these two animals was
noted to have an enlargement of the transplants and
marked albuminuria on the 18th day. At autopsy an
acute interstitial nephritis with plasma cell infiltration
was found, and was noted to be more marked in the
cortex than in the medulla. In the second cat swelling
of the transplant and albuminuria was noted on the 16th
day. An exploratory laparotomy on the 18th day re￾vealed the transplanted kidneys to be edematous and
large. At autopsy on the 36th day a marked calcification
of the aorta and other vessels was noted (23). The kid￾neys were said to have secreted urine up to the day of
death.
Floresco in 1905 (46) performed renal homotrans￾plants to the inguinal area, the neck, and the renal fossa
in dogs. He concluded that the renal fossa was the
most suitable location, the inguinal area the least. The
average survival of the transplants was about 3 days.
Villard and Tavernier in 1910 (130) and Villard and
Perrin in 1913 (131) homografted the kidney in nine
instances. The longest time any of the transplants se￾creted urine was 8 days.
Avramovici in 1924 (4) reported doing renal hetero￾transplants from cat to dog en masse, taking out both

the recipient's kidneys. Two of these cases were said to
have survived 49 and 58 days, with normal renal se￾cretion. At autopsy the transplanted kidneys were said
to appear normal. No histological studies or urine analy￾ses were done. Homotransplantations, en masse, were
done in 11 dogs, all recipients having bilateral nephrec￾tomies. One dog was said to have lived 61 days, dying
of bronchopneumonia. Another lived 73 days. No his￾tological or urinary studies were reported. In six ad￾ditional experiments, bilateral renal homografts were
done in two stages. Three of these animals were said
to have survived 33, 44, and 58 days. When transplanting
only one kidney (leaving one of the host's kidneys iin
situt) survivals of 41, 56, and 60 days were obtained.
The only mention made of microscopic studies was in
the animal which survived 56 days. The transplanted
kidney was said to show glomerular lesions, alterations
of the tubular epithelium, and an inflammation-not too
marked-of the interstitial tissue.
Avramovici also performed transplantations of kidneys
which had been preserved in the cold for varying pe￾riods of time up to 30 hours. One transplant which had
been thus preserved for 8 hours was then homotrans￾planted, one of the host's kidneys being removed. Four￾teen days later the other kidney of the host was removed.
The animal was said to have lived 36 days more.
Renal homotransplantaticns in experimental animals as
successful as those reported by Avramovici have not been
achieved by any other workers before or since. The
absence of microscopic and urinary studies, added to
the lack of confirmation by others, makes it difficult to
attribute much importance to these findings.
Dederer, 1920 (28, 29), performed a homotransplant
of a kidney from one puppy to another of the same litter,
making the anastomosis in the neck and leaving both
of the recipient's kidneys intact. The animal died of
distemper on the 26th day. The only function test done
was to inject PSP dye, which was said to have been ex￾creted by the transplanted kidney, following injection,
on the 26th day.
Williamson, 1923 (135) and 1926 (136), using dogs
and goats, confirmed Carrel's findings that whereas auto￾genous kidney transplants would maintain the life of
the animal for months after removal of the other kidney,
homologous transplants functioned only for a period of
days. The histologic picture said by him to follow
homotransplantation in the dog was that of acute atypi￾cal glomerulonephritis with lymphocytic infiltration, fol￾lowed by general acute nephritis and ascending infec￾tion. If the transplanted kidney was allowed to remain
in place after anuria developed, there was a tendency
for it to be replaced by fibrous tissue. He concluded
that the failure of homologous kidney transplants seemed
attributable to a biologic incompatibility between the
donor and recipient. He felt that the agent causing
this was blood-borne, attacking first the glomeruli, and
then the tubules.
Ibuka, 1926 (61) reviewed the literature on renal homo￾transplantation up to that date. He did a series of
autotransplants to the neck in dogs, to demonstrate that
these were capable of functioning for months. He then
did 14 homotransplants by the same technique. Two
were technical failures, and 4 succumbed to immediate
post-operative sequellae. The remaining 8 cases were
carefully followed, and analyses were performed on the
urine. The transplants secreted urine for from 1 to 5
days, averaging 3 days. They stopped secreting before
infection set in, and in spite of having an adequate blood
flow and maintaining a patent ureter. Microscopically
they showed an acute nephritis with lymphocytic and
plasma cell infiltration and tubular destruction. The
glomeruli ap;peared fairly normal.
Holloway, 1926, (54) found that homotransplants re￾mained viable only two to four days, the destructive
process starting in 24 hours.
Wu and Mann, 1934, (139) made a microscopic study
of the day to day progress of auto- and homo-trans￾plants in the dog. The transplants functioned alike until
1) they were removed, 2) the animal died, 3) thrombosis
of one or both vessels occurred, or 4) pyelonephritis su￾pervened. Some transplants never functioned. This was
not due to thrombosis. Microscopically, monocytic in￾terstitial infiltration and tubular necrosis were observed.
The glomeruli still looked quite normal.
Parkinson and Woodworth, 1947, (105) performed re￾nal transplantations in goats, and refer to them as hetero￾transplants, on the basis that the goats used were of
different types. The kidneys were placed in the neck.
Anastomoses were made with vitallium tubes. Auto￾grafts always developed such good collateral supply that
they continued to function even when the vessels throm￾bosed. Homografts had an active arterial supply and
venous return at one week, but had become soft, nearly
gelatinous, and poorly demarcated. They secreted urine
for 10 days. At 14 days they were dissolved.
Oudot, 1948 (104) cooled the kidneys to 4 degrees C.
for periods up to 8 days before transplanting them. In￾farction of the kidneys occurred immediately after trans￾plantation. Payr tubes of "superpolyamides" were used
as prostheses. Non-cooled renal homografts with cu￾taneous ureterostomies stopped functioning in 10 days.
This was felt to be on the basis of a suppurative necrosis
due to ascending infection.
Lefebvre, 1949, (74) showed that a homograft can
clear urea. He reports one dog which lived for 21 days
after homotransplantationi, with a normal blood urea
n-itrogen for the first 19 days. The transplants were made
in the neck, with vitallium prostheses. He also studied
the effect of perfusing the kidney and storing it at
low temperatures before transplantation (75). The
transplanted kidney was observed only for short periods
of time. He found that kidneys stored up to 24 hours
were capable of showing a return of function after trans￾plantation, as measured by diuresis, chloride output, re￾turn of oxygen consumption, excretion of bilirubin and
urochrome, and urea output. All of these indices, except
chloride output, showed the function to be below that

of a normal kidney. (Maximum urea concentration
noted was five times that of blood).
Recently, Simonsen and his co-workers (119-121) and
Dempster (30-34) have studied renal homotransplanta￾tion in dogs. Their work will be considered in some
detail later on in the paper.
To summarize, most investigators have found that
renal homotransplants in the experimental animal func￾tion for from 1 to 18 days, with an average of about 4
days. They cease urine secretion at a time when blood
flow through the renal vessels can still be demonstrated.
Histologically, the kidney which has stopped secreting
shows interstitial edema and round cell infiltration and
tubular destruction. The glomeruli remain relatively
normal.
Renal homotransplantation iit the human
On occasion an attempt has been made to use a human
kidney homograft as a temporary aid to tide the patient
over an episode of acute anuria. Voronoy, 1936 (132)
transplanted a kidney into the groin of a patient with
bichloride of mercury poisoning, but the patient died in
48 hours and no conclusions can be drawn from this ex￾periment. Details are lacking. Landsteiner and Huf￾nagel in 1945 (70) transplanted a kidney from a cadaver
to the brachial artery and cephalic vein of a young
woman in acute renal failure. The patient's own kidneys
began to resume function a few hours after the trans￾plantation, and the transplanit was removed after 48
hours, without having secreted any significant amotiiit
of urine.
Lawler, West, McNulty, Clancy, and Murphy in 1950,
(72) removed a kidney from a woman with polycystic
kidney disease and anastomosed the kidney from a
cadaver to the patient's renial artery and vein. The
ureter was anastomosed to that of the recipient. These
authors injected indigo carmine (lye )arenterally on the
52nd day, and stated that it was observed to emerge
from both ureters, but in poorer concentration from the
side of the transplanted kidney. No other kidney func￾tion tests were done. At the time of removal of the
transplant, 91/ months after implantatioin, the kidney was
found to be 4 by 3 by 2 cm. in size, with absence of the
ureteral and pelvic structures. It was not producing
urine (73).
Servelle, Soulie, Rougeulle, Delahaye, and Touche
(115, 116) reported one human homotransplant, and Du￾bost and his associates (35) reported two at a meeting of
the Medical Society of Paris Hospitals in January, 1951.
All transplants were made in the pelvis, and the ves￾sels were anastomosed to the iliac vessels. The kidney
transplanted by Servelle and his co-workers reached an
output of 600 ml. by the 19th day, at which time the
patient suddenly died. The two transplants reported by
Dubost and his associates had been performed only 14
and 3 days before the meeting. The first kidney se￾creted a maximum of 230 ml. of urine in 24 hours, and
the patient died on the 16th day (36). The second trans￾plant secreted only a few milliliters.
Kuss, Tienturier, and Milliez are reported by Lawler,
West, McNulty, Clancy, and Murphy (73) to have per￾formed 16 homotransplants in the human, several of
which have "functioned for several months," but in their
publication (68) they describe only five, and in a per￾sonal communication, to one of us (DMH) (69) Kuss re￾ports having done only one more. Of the five published
cases, one patient died on the operating table, and in one
the graft was removed 48 hours after the transplantation.
A third case developed necrosis of the ureter, and the
transplant excreted small amounts of urine for only 18
days. The patient died on the 20th day. A fourth trans￾plant developed necrosis of the ureter on the 20th day.
The maximum output was 72 ml. in 24 hours, on the 10th
day. The kidney was still excreting a few drops of
urine when it was removed after 31' months. In the
final subject the maximal 24-hour output was 45 ml.
The ureter became necrotic on the 20th day, and the pa￾tient died on the 35th day. An extensive infarction of
the kidney was found at necropsy. The sixth case was
said to have shown no better function (69). In these
cases the transplant was placed in the pelvis of the re￾cipient, and an anastomosis was carried out between
the hypogastric artery and the renal artery, and between
the external iliac vein and the renal vein. The ureter
was brought out to the skin.
Recently, Michon and his associates (101) have re￾ported a case in which the transplant functioned well for
23 days. More will be said about this case later.
In general, renal homotransplantation in the human
has not been any more successful than in experimental
animals.
METHODS
In eight of the nine cases reported herein the homolo￾gous kidney was transplanted into a pocket created in
the medial aspect of the upper thigh. In all eight cases
anastomoses were carried out between the deep femoral
artery and the renal artery, and between the renal vein
and the femoral vein. In one instance an end-to-end
anastomosis was made between the superficial femoral
vein and the renal vein, and in one case a similar anas￾tomosis was performed using the common femoral vein.
In six cases an end-to-side anastomosis was made be￾tween the renal vein and the common femoral vein, and
this was found to be the most satisfactory method. In
all cases the deep femoral artery was isolated for a dis￾tance of 7 to 8 cm., and all branches were ligated and
divided. It was then ligated as far distally as possible,
a bulldog clamp was placed on it proximally, just distal
to the bifurcation of the common femoral, and it was di￾vided just proximal to the tie. A site was selected
along the isolated vessel which most closely conformed
to the size of the renal artery, and it was again divided
at this point, and end-to-end anastomosis with the renal
artery was carried out. All anastomoses were done
with 6-0 arterial silk, using continuous everting mattress
sutures, and tying the suture to each of three or four
interrupted stay sutures. The ureter was brought out
330

RENAL HOMOTRANSPLANTATION IN THE HUMAN
FIG. 1. THE METHOD OF PLACING THE RENAL TRANSPLANT IN THE RIGHT
THIGH
The kidney is buried in a pocket created between the subcutaneous tissue and
the muscles in the medial aspect of the thigh. The renal artery is anastomosed
end-to-end to the profunda femoris artery, and the renal vein is anastomosed
end-to-side into the common femoral vein. A double-ended pedicle flap is
pulled over to help cover the kidney without tension on the skin. A split skin
graft (not shown) is then applied over the lateral aspect of the thigh in the
defect left by the moving over of the pedicle flap. The ureter will be brought
out through a stab wound in the lower portion of the pedicle flap.
through a small incision in the skin. The relation of the
vessels to the kidney is shown in Figure 1.
In the first two cases the kidney was placed in a space
fashioned between the subcutaneous tissue and the fascia
overlying the adductor muscles. This created a great
deal of tension on the skin, and a slough of the skin de￾veloped. In five cases a double-ended pedicle of skin and
subcutaneous tissue 30 by 15 cm. in size was raised off
the fascia laterally, swung over medially to create a cov￾ering for the kidney without tension on the skin. A
split thickness graft taken from the other leg was then
used to cover the defect left laterally over the fascia
lata. This worked very satisfactorily. In one case
pieces of the rectus femoris and sartorius muscle were
removed and end-to-end anastomosis with the deep fe￾moral artery and common femoral vein was carried out
over polyethylene tubes which were temporarily tied
in place to re-establish circulation as rapidly as pos￾sible. This technique of vascular suture has been de￾scribed by Hufnagel (56). The kidney was then placed
in the defect left by the removal of the muscles, and the
skin was closed over it without tension. No skin flap
was used. A great deal of tension developed by the 5th
day, however, because of hemorrhage from the cut mus￾cles and edema of the leg, and the wound had to be re￾opened, and a relaxing incision made.
In eight cases heparin was used for varying lengths of
time, and in six cases ACTH or cortisone or both
were employed. Testosterone was given in every case.
Various antibiotics were administered.
The donor kidneys were obtained from cadavers in
six cases.2. Great care was taken not to injure the
blood supply of the ureter. The kidneys were removed
under strict aseptic conditions. In two cases the kidneys
came from living donors and were essentially normal
kidneys. These two cases were patients aged 2 and 33,
the first with communicating hydrocephalus and the sec￾ond with hydrocephalus caused by a block of the aque￾2 In three of these-the kidney was removed by Dr.
Frank Collins, in one by Dr. Phillip Walker, and in two
by Dr. Robert Desautels.

duct by tumor. A communication was established via a
polyethylene tube between the ureter and the sub￾arachnoid space in one case, and between the ureter and
ventricle in the other, to relieve the increased intra￾cranial pressure. This operation, which was developed
and performed by Dr. Donald MNatson (89), necessi￾tates the removal of one kidney.
The recipients were all patients in irreversible termi￾nal uremia on the basis of chronic pyelonephritis in five
cases, chronic glcmerulonephritis in two cases, poly￾cystic kidney disease in one case, and periarteritis lno￾dosa in one case. The transplanted kidneys came from
donors of the same blood type as the recipients in seven
cases, and different blood types in two cases.
When hemodialysis was necessary it was carried out
with a modification of the Kolff artificial kidney (99).
One patient (F. A.), a 37-year-old man with chronic
pyelonephritis and severe uremiiia, was referrcl to the
Peter Bent Brigham Hospital where he was twice dialyzed
on the artificial kidney durinig a 14-day hospitalization.
He was then transferred to ala outside hospital where
a donor kidney was available. A transplant was per￾formed by Dr. James V. Scola.3 The left kidney and
spleen of the recipient were removed and anastomoses
were made end-to-end between the splenic artery and the
renal artery, and between the two renal veins. The pel￾vis of the transplant was anastomosed to the ureter of
the recipient, and a T-tube was brought out from the
ureter through a stab wound. The patient was readmitted
to the Peter Bent Brigham Hospital on the 3rd day, and
was followed by us until his deatlh on the 37th day.
Sodium and potassium were determined with the Beck￾man flame photometer; inulin by the method of Schreiner
(111); para-amino-hippurate by the method of Finkel￾stein, Aliminosa, and Smith (44); urea by the method of
Archibald (2); chloride by the method of Schales and
Schales (109), and Asper, Schales and Schales (3);
urine creatinine by the method of Bonsnes and Taussky
(14); phosphorus by the method of Fiske anid Subbarow
(45) ; ammonia by the method of Folin and Bell (47);
carbon dioxide by the method of Van Slyke and Ncill
(129); and urinary protein by the method of Chinard
(27). Urinary sediment was evaluated by the semi￾quantitative method of Addis (1).
RESULTS
A summmary of the results in the cases reporte(d
here is shown in Table I. A (letailed report of the
cases follows in their chronological order.

Diagniosis: Chronic pyelonephritis, hypertension, uremia.
The patient was referred to tlle Peter Bent Brigham
Hospital from the Springfield Hospital, Springfield,
Massachusetts, on 3-20-51 by Dr. L. H. Doolittle. A
diagnosis of acute nephritis had been made at the Spring￾Springfield Hospital, Springfield, Massachusetts.
field Hospital 18 years previously. In 1950 he was again
admitted there and studies were made which led to a
diagnosis of chronic pyelonephritis. He had known hy￾pertension for two years. For three months before ad￾mission, he had complained of nausea, vomiting, drowsi￾ness, and increasing weakness.
Physical exaninlation showed a chronically ill, semi￾comatose man complaining bitterly of hack pain. Optic
fundi showed narrowing of the arterioles aith an oc￾casional fresh punctate hemorrhage. Lunigs were clear.
The heart was slightly enlarged to percussion, and there
was an apical presystolic gallop. Blood pressure was
170/90. There was bilateral costo-vertebral tenderness.
Jaboratory data: The urine specific gravity was 1010
with 4 + proteinuria, 5-10 red cells, and a few w-hite
blood cells in the unspun sediment. The hematocrit was

and E. coli. A chest film showed the heart to be at the
upper limits of normal, the contours suggesting left ven￾tricular hypertrophy. The vascular markings were in￾creased.
In spite of 5 days of conservative therapy, there was
no improvement in the clinical status. On the 6th hos￾pital day, dialysis with the artificial kidney was per￾formed with good chemical result but little clinical
change. The patient was again dialyzed on the 10th
hospital day, and following this procedure, there was
definite marked clinical improvement.
On 3-30-51, the day of the last dialysis, the patient was
transferred to the Springfield Hospital. The following
day a renal homograft was performed by Dr. James V.
Scola. The donor was a patient with carcinoma of the
lower end of the ureter whose kidney was removed by
Dr. L. H. Doolittle at the same time that exposure wvas
being obtained in the recipient. Both patients were blood
type A, Rh +. A left nephrectomy and splenectomy
were performed, and the splenic artery was anastomosed
to the renal artery of the homograft, and the renal vein
to renal vein. The recipient's ureter was anastomosed
to the pelvis of the transplant, and a T-tube was placed
in the ureter and brought to the outside. The period of
ischemia of the transplanted kidney was 70 minutes. The
patient tolerated the procedure well, and on the 4th day
he was readmitted to the Peter Bent Brigham Hospital.
Following operation, the urine volume had decreased,
although the clinical condition on readmission was gen￾erally better than prior to operation. The patient re￾ceived seven blood transfusions on the operative day.
Physical examiniation on the second admissioni was
much as before, with the exception that breath sounds
were absent and tactile fremitus reduced over the left
lower lung field. A marked pericardial friction rub was
present. The abdomen was now distended and tym￾panitic, although peristalsis was present. The hemato￾crit was 32, white blood count 22,400, blood urea nitrogen

per day of ACTH intramuscularly (I-M) 4 for 3 days.
On the 4th day he received 65 mgm. I-M, and from the
5th through the 11th day he received 25 mgm. per day
intravenously (I-V) 4 or 100 mgm. I-M. It was tapered
off from the 11th to 13th day. No cortisone was given.
He received 100 mgm. of testosterone propionate on the
15th day, and 50 mgm. per day thereafter from the 16th
through the 37th day.
On the 9th day, because of deterioration in the clini￾cal condition, hemodialysis was performed with good
clinical response. The abdominal distention, however,
continued to be a major problem. Hemodialysis was
performed again on the 18th, the 26th, and the 32nd days
with deterioration of the clinical state between each pro￾cedure. The urine output varied between 300 and 100
ml., of which varying amounts came from the ureteral
T-tube of the homograft. It was difficult to evaluate
what percentage of the T-tube drainage was reflux from

the bladder urine. Indigo carmine was inj ected once
and PSP twice, but neither of these dyes appeared in
bladder or T-tube urine.
On the 15th hospital day, a friction rub appeared in
the right axilla. On the 23rd day, because of separa￾tion and infection of the abdominal wound, a debride￾ment and secondary closure were carried out. On the
27th day a retrograde injection of contrast media into
the T-tube catheter showed what appeared to be a small
drainage cavity resulting in some break in the continuity
of the suture line near the renal pelvis of the homograft.
On the 34th day a left thoracentesis yielded 620 ml. of
apple-jelly colored fluid. The patient now appeared
brighter. On the 37th day he complained of chest pain,
and shortly after an intercostal block for this pain, the
patient gasped suddenly and expired.
Post-mortem examination showed chronic pyelonephri￾tis of the right kidney, perinephric abscess about the left
homograft, empyema of the right pleural cavity, left pul￾monary atelectasis, and left ventricular hypertrophy.
Gross examination of the homograft showed it to be
slightly enlarged and somewhat mottled. Except, how￾ever, for the perinephric abscess, the gross appearance
was not markedly abnormal (see Figure 2). Micro￾scopic examination showed a dense avascular connec￾tive tissue sheath surrounding the capsule of the trans￾planted kidney. This reaction appeared to be mostly
extra-capsular (see Figure 3). The glomeruli appeared

present in the lumen of the tubules. There was also
some regeneration of tubular epithelium which was most
noticeable in the distal tubules (see Figure 5). The

Case II-M. P., femnale, age 30, No. 6B376
Diagnosis: Chronic pyeloi:ephritis, hypertension, uremia.
This 30-year-old white female was admitted to the
Peter Bent Brigham Hospital for the second time on
3-14-51. On a previous admission, 13 months before,
the diagnosis of hypertensive vascular disease, pyelo￾nephritis, and uremia had been made. The hospital stay

revealed positive cultures from each ureter, proteinuria,
hypertension without cardia enlargement, and a blood
urea nitrogen of 40 mgm. per cent. The present admis￾sion was occasioned by severe nausea and vomiting fol￾lowing an upper respiratory infection. In an outside
hospital, in spite of therapy, this had progressed to
semi-coma accompanied by twitching and convulsions.
Physical examination: On admission the patient was
a critically ill, dehydrated, semi-comatose young woman.
Blood pressure was 158/100. The optic fundi were un￾remarkable except for moderate arterio-venous nicking.
The heart was now enlarged by x-ray, and there was a
presystolic gallop with a grade II apical systolic mur￾mur. There was no venous distension, and no peripheral
edema. A few dry rales were heard at the left base.
The reflexes were markedly hypoactive.
Laboratory data: The blood urea nitrogen was 113
mgm. per cent, carbon dioxide combining power 14.1
mM. per L., serum chloride 86 mEq. per L., sodium 133
mEq. per L., potassium 4.3 mEq. per L., and phos￾phate 4.3 mEq. per L. The hematocrit was 19, and the
white blood count was 5,300 with a normal differential.
Hospital course: The patient showed very little im￾provement after 8 days of conservative therapy, and on
3-22-51 hemodialysis with the artificial kidney was per￾formed. There was a temporary improvement following
this. However, on 4-14-51 the patient again had a gen￾eralized convulsion, following which she was maintained
on Dilantin® without further convulsive episodes. By

4-20-51 the blood urea nitrogen had risen to 210 mgm.
per cent with a serum potassium of 7.9 mEq. per L. On
4-23-51 a renal homograft was transplanted into the right
thigh, employing a kidney from a patient who had died
during a surgical procedure for hypertensive vascular
disease. The donor's blood type was 0, Rh +, while
that of the recipient was A, Rh +, thus presenting com￾patibility in the major grouping but not in the minor.
The period of time which elapsed between the death of
the donor and the re-establishment of blood flowv through
the transplant in the host was 150 minutes. (In subse￾quent cases this interval will be spoken of as the period
of ischemia of the kidney. In cases in which the donor
was living, the beginning of the interval will be reck￾oned from the time when the renal vessels were
clamped.)
The kidney was perfused with normal saline solution
as soon as it was removed from the cadaver, because of
the blood group incompatibility. End-to-end anastomoses
were made betwxeen the profunda femoris artery and the
renal artery, and between the superficial femoral vein
and renal vein. The bulldog clamp was removed from
the femoral vein and heparin was inserted through a
No. 26 needle into the renal artery. The arterial clamp
was now removed, and with the re-establishment of the
circulation, the kidney became pink. There are two
details worth noting at this point: 1) By mistake 125
mgm. of heparin, instead of 25 mgm., was injected into
the renal artery, and thus into the general circulationi￾this was followed shortly by oozing from the wound
edges; and 2) this kidney and the kidney in Case No. 6
were not quite as vigorously or quickly distended with
blood when the clamps were removed as the other trans￾plants were. Both these kidneys, unlike the others, came
from hypertensive donors, whose blood types were differ￾ent from that of the recipient, and both kidneys were per￾fused before being anastomosed. One or all of these three
factors may have had some bearing on the apparently ini￾tially somewhat diminished blood flow of these kidneys
compared to the other grafts.
A pocket was fashioned between the fascia of the ad￾ductor muscles and the subcutaneous tissue, and the sub￾cutaneous tissue and skin were closed over the kidney.
The ureter was brought out through a stab wound.
For 48 hours the patient was given heparin, 40 mgm.
every 6 hours I-M, and ACTH, 20 mgm. every 8 hours
I-V. She was then given 225 mgm. of cortisone and
50 mgm. of testosterone daily for 7 days. Hemodialysis
was again performed on the 2nd day because of her poor
clinical condition, and she improved markedly following
this. A large hematoma developed beneath the skini
flaps, and by the 3rd day the skin overlying the trans￾plant had become shiny and tense, and the ureter was
necrotic. It was decided to re-explore the transplant.
There was a large hematoma around the kidney. The
kidney was a normal pink color, and there was a good
blood flow through it. The capsule bled freely, and it
was therefore replaced and a relaxing incision was made
in the skin laterally.
Sepsis developed in the wound. A biopsy of the
kidney on the 13th day showed infarction of the kidney,
and it was removed 4 days later. The renal vessels were
thrombosed and massive infarction of the kidney had
occurred. Six days later the infection in the wound
eroded through the superficial femoral artery, and a
severe hemorrhage occurred. The patient was reoper￾ated and it was found that an eroded area in the artery
2 cm. long and 0.5 cm. wide had given way. It was im￾possible to suture the vessel because the wall was
necrotic. A lucite tube was placed in the vessel, there￾fore, and tied in with nylon rings after the method de￾scribed by Hufnagel and Gillespie (57). A skin graft
was laid over the blood vessel. During the next 2 days
the sensation, movement, and temperature of the leg
were normal. Good pulses could be felt in the foot. At
this time the patient had an episode of pulmonary and
cerebral edema and died suddenly. At post-mortem the
lucite tube was patent, and the femoral artery appeared
viable on either side of the nylon rings which held the
tube in place.
Gross and microscopic examination of the homograft
in this case revealed total infarction of the tissues, the
renal structure being so distorted that no other changes
were discernible.
Case III-F. Z., female, age 43, No. 5A157
Diagnosis: Chronic pyelonephritis, hypertension, ar￾teriosclerosis, uremia.
This was the sixth admission of this patient with
chronic progressive uremia who had been treated on two
previous occasions by the artificial kidney with satisfac￾tory results. Her blood urea nitrogen prior to dialysis
had been as high as 188 mgm. per cent. She was ad￾mitted to the hospital on this occasion specifically for a
renal homograft, having been discharged one week previ￾ously, following dialysis.
Physical examinationt: The patient was a well developed
woman with dry scaling skin and generalized pallor. The
blood pressure was 165/90. There was slight sclerosis
of the retinal vessels. The lung fields were clear, and
the heart was enlarged to percussion with a protodiastolic
gallop and a course systolic bruit at the fourth inter￾space. Chest x-ray showed hilar congestion and marked
cardiac enlargement. The liver was enlarged three
finger breadths below the right costal margin and was
slightly tender. There was minimal presacral ani(l pre￾tibial edema.
Laboratory data: The urine slhowed 2 + proteinuria,
and 10-20 white cells with rare granular casts in the
spun sediment. The blood urea nitrogen was 96 mgm.
per cent, serum carbon dioxide combining power 11.6 mM.
per L., sodium 130 mEq. per L., and potassium 6.8 mEq.
per L.
On 4-24-51, the day of admission, a renal homograft
was done. The donor was a patient with severe mitral
stenosis who died during a valvuloplasty. Her urine
contained from 1 + to 4 + albumen on many occasions,
but her blood urea nitrogen was, within the normal range.

Examination of her other kidney showed multiple small
infarcts-apparently caused by emboli. Both donor and
recipient were blood group B, Rh +, and their bloods
were cross-matched and found to be compatible. The
period of ischemia was 135 minutes. The kidney was
transplanted into the right thigh by means of an end-to￾end anastomosis of the profunda femoris artery with the
renal artery, and an end-to-side anastomosis of the renal
vein into the common femoral vein. The kidney was
niot perfused. There was marked sclerosis of the re￾cipient's vessels, and some sutures were taken through
arterio-sclerotic plaques. Nonetheless the kidney be￾came distended with blood as soon as the clamps were
removed, and was a normal pink color. The kidney was
placed in a pocket created between the fascia overlying
the adductor muscles and the subcutaneous fat. The sub￾cutaneous tissue and skin were closed over the kidney, and
there was a moderate amount of tension on the skin. The
patient received 25 mgm. of ACTH every 6 hours for
24 hours, and was then given 225 to 300 mgm. of corti￾sone daily for 18 days, at which time it was reduced
to 100 mgm. daily and ACTH, 80 mgm. a day, was be￾gun again. The cortisone was stopped after 25 days,
and the ACTH was gradually tapered off after 31 days.
She was given 40 mgm. of heparin every 6 hours for 14
days, and 50 mgm. of testosterone daily for 29 days, at
which time it was tapered off and stopped on the 34th
day. Penicillin and Purodigin® were also given.
During the first week after the transplantation, necro￾sis of the skin overlying the kidney began to develop
because of edema in the wound and tension on the skin
flaps. The ureter was not yet involved in this process,
but it was edematous and it ultimately became markedly
swollen and pale. After 81,2 days of anuria the trans￾8 M4: m_.S.#' '-;

planted kidney began to excrete urine. The urine was
collected by letting the tip of the ureter hang down into
a polyethylene sac which led through tubing to a bottle.
These collections were somewhat inaccurate, at first be￾cause the ureter would sometimes pull out of the sac
when the patient turned in bed, and later because as pro￾gressive slough of the ureter occurred, there was leak￾age from the wound. On the 14th day, 6 ml. of indigo
carmine was injected intravenously. Small quantities
of dye were noted to appear in the urine from the trans￾planted kidney, but none was seen in the bladder urine.
By the 18th day the transplant had reached an output
of more than 600 ml. per day. A phenolsulfonphthalein
excretion (PSP) test was performed on this day and
showed an output of 10 per cent of the dye in 2 hours in
the urine from the transplanted kidney and less than 5
per cent in the bladder urine. An injection of amino￾phyllin intravenously produced a marked transient in￾crease in urinary output from the transplanted kidney.
A comparison between the bladder and transplant urine
is shown in Table II.
The slough of skin over the kidney continued to in￾crease in size, and after the 22nd day it was no longer
possible to obtain accurate urine collections.
On the 24th day the patient was re-operated and a
polyethylene tube was placed in the wound and led to
a gravity drain bottle, and wound suction was started
over the dressings in an attempt to get more complete
collections and keep the patient's leg drier. About 500
ml. per day was collected by these routes. After 6 days
the slough had spread so much the tube had to be
removed.
PSP tests were repeated on the 22nd and 31st days,
and dye was seen to appear within 10 minutes each time.
No quantitative tests were possible. Urinary output be￾gan to diminish from the 33rd day on, although by the
53rd day the kidney was still excreting an estimated
200 to 300 ml. per day. On the 57th day the patient was
dialyzed because of deterioration of her clinical state.
As the slough spread, the kidney finally became almost
completely exposed. The wound was debrided and gran￾ulation tissue grew over the transplant. The cortex still
bled vigorously when cut. On the 70th day a biopsy of
the kidney was performed. The kidney parenchyma bled
freely during the biopsy. Microscopically the biopsy
showed the glomeruli to be relatively bloodless, but
without any specific exudative or proliferative response
(see Figure 6). There was edema and polymorpho￾nuclear and round cell infiltration of the interstitial spaces
(see Figure 7). The predominate picture was that of in￾fection-pyelonephritis and interstitial nephritis-associ￾ated with a conspicuous calcific degeneration of the tu￾bular epithelium. There were pigment casts and cal￾cific masses in the tubular lumina (see Figure 8).
Thrombosis of some of the smaller vessels could be
seen, associated with focal infarcts.
On the 73rd day a retrograde pyelogram was done
on the homograft. The renal pelvis and calyces ap￾peared fairly normal. The urinary output fell off almost
to nothing. The entire transplant became necrotic and

Post-mortem examination was limited to the homo￾graft, and showed extensive autolysis and vascular
thrombosis (see Figure 9). Marked evidence of infec￾tion, with colonies of bacteria, and extensive infarction,
were seen. Again the dominant inflammatory cell was
the polymorphonuclear leucocyte, and there was no evi￾dence of acute arteritis.
Case IV-B. B., female, age 52, No. 7B634
Diagnosis: Polycystic kidney disease, pyelonephritis,
hypertension, uremia.
This was the third admission of a 52-year-old house￾wife with known polycystic kidney disease. She had
been admitted to this hospital for the first time 7 months
before the present admission for drowsiness, vomiting, and
oliguria. Good symptomatic improvement was obtained
by dialysis with the artificial kidney on two occasions.
She was again admitted 7 weeks before the present
admission, being discharged 4 weeks later. Her present
admission on 5-24-51 was in preparation for a renal
homotransplant.
Physical examination: On this occasion, examination
revealed a well developed white female in no apparent
distress. The skin was dry and rough with spotty
cafe-au-lait pigmentation. Blood pressure was 170/100.
The arterioles of the fundi showed some irregularity and
slight A-V nicking. The heart was enlarged to per￾cussion with a grade I apical systolic murmur, and
normal sinus rhythm. The lungs were clear. The kid￾neys were enlarged and easily palpable. There was no
peripheral edema.
Laboratory data: The urine was clear, with a specific
gravity of 1.009, and 2 + proteinuria. The sediment
showed no red blood cells or casts, but 3 to 4 white
blood cells per high power field. Hematocrit was 33,
white blood count 6,900, blood urea nitrogen 78 mgm.
per cent, serum total protein 6.3 gm. per cent, carbon

On 5-26-51 a kidney was transplanted into the right
thigh. The donor was a patient with tetralogy of Fal￾lot who died 4 days after an operation to widen the
pulmonary valve. Both donor and recipient were blood
type B, Rh +, and their bloods were cross-matched and
found to be compatible. An end-to-end anastomosis was
again made between the profunda femoris artery and the
renal artery, and an end-to-side anastomosis was per￾formed between the renal vein and the common femoral
vein. The kidney was not perfused. The period of
ischemia was 200 minutes.6 An injection of 25 mgm. of
heparin was made into the renal artery with a No. 26
needle. Circulation through the kidney appeared excel￾lent, and the ureter, which was left about 5 inches long,

delay in obtaining the donor kidney.

was well vascularized, and active peristaltic waves passed
along it.
A pocket was again created between the adductor fascia
and the subcutaneous fat, but this time a large 15 by 30
cm. double-ended pedicle flap of skin and subcutaneous
fat was raised laterally off the anterior and lateral deep
fascia. This pedicle was used to cover the kidney. The
fascia lata, which was left bare by moving this flap over.
was covered with a split thickness skin graft taken fronm
the other leg. The ureter w-as brought out through a
small incision in the pedicle, and allowed to project about
1 inch past the skin margin. A catheter was left in the
ureter for 2 weeks. These relationships are shown in
Figures 10 and 11. The skin was closed without tension.
The patient was treated with heparin, 20 mgm. I-M
every 6 hours for 24 days. Cortisone 100 mgm. I-M
every 8 hours was given for 1 week, then 50 mgm. every
8 hours for 1 week. It was then gradually tapered off
over the next 4 days, being stopped on the 18th day.
ACTH, 100 mgm. per day, was given from the 8th to
21st day, and it was then tapered off over the next 3 days.
On the 29th day cortisone, 150 mgm. a day, was again
resumed and continued until the 45th day. Testosterone
propionate, 50 mgm. a day, was given from the 1st to
the 25th day, and from the 66th to the 90th day. Peni￾cillin was given for the first 30 days, following which
various antibiotics were administered, including Chloro￾mycetin(®, Aureomycing, and Terramycin®.
Following the operation, the tip of the ureter pro￾truding through the skin ureterostomy appeared pink and
healthy. It was necessary on the 3rd day to ligate a
small bleeding artery on the tip of the ureter.
The wounds healed well. For the first 11 days after
the operation the transplant was essentially anuric, se￾creting only a few ml. of clear urine. On the 12th day,
however, urine began to flow in gradually increasing
amounts reaching a maximum 24-hour output of 2826
mnl. on the 18th day. The urine was collected by fastening
a regular ureterostomy cup over the ureter with skin
glue, and leading the outflow to a bottle beside the pa￾tient's bed, or to a bag strapped to her leg when she was
up (see Figure 12).
The specific gravity of the urine from the transplant
varied between 1.008 and 1.020. The sediment contained
2 to 3 white blood cells and 3 to 4 red blood cells per
high power field, as contrasted with 25 to 30 white blood
cells and 0 to 1 red blood cells per high power field for
the bladder urine. The protein varied from 1 + to 2 +,
while the bladder urine ran 1 + to 3 +. Urine sugar was
negative. Both bladder and transplant urine contained
many bacteria, and cultures showed various coliform or￾ganisms which were resistant to all antibiotics. A com￾parison between the transplant urine and bladder urine
at various times in the post-operative period is shown in
Table III. It may be seen from this chart that during

the period of maximal function the transplant urine con￾tinued to show greater concentrations of urine urea ni￾trogen, creatinine, and potassium, and lower concentra￾tions of sodium and chloride than the bladder urine.
Renal function studies were carried out simultaneously
on the homograft and the patient's own kidneys. The
results of one of these studies are shown in Table IV.
During the period of maximal function of the transplant,
between the 14th to 28th day, the patient's blood urea
nitrogen and potassium steadily dropped, and the pa￾tient became symptom-free for the first time in two
years. As the function of the transplant dropped off
again, the blood urea nitrogen and potassium rose, and
it was necessary to dialyze the patient oni the 66th day
(see Table V). It was of interest that the volume of the
bladder urine decreased as the transplant diuresed, and
increased again as the volume of the transplant fell off.
The patient became febrile on the 25th day, and on
the 29th day she had a chill with a temperature to 1040.
This was accompanied by tenderness and heat over the
transplanted kidney, and some pain in the leg. It ap￾peared that the patient had developed a pyelitis of this
kidney. Chloromycetin® therapy was re-instituted, and
cortisone was given, as well, because of the feeling that
the "immune response" might be playing some part in
this reaction. There was a gradual fall in temperature
over the next 5 days, accompanied, however, by a de￾crease in the output of the homotransplant. It is in￾teresting that after this acute episode had subsided
somewhat the transplant was again able to increase its
urinary volume and urea nitrogen output temporarily.
The temperature again rose to 1030 on the 41st day,
and thereafter, in spite of antibiotic therapy, the daily

rises were accompanied by a deterioration in the clinical
condition. The spiking fever persisted until the 84th
hospital day, at which time there was an 8-day period
when the patient was afebrile. Output from the homo￾graft had diminished at this time to 50 to 75 ml. a day.
On the 92nd day she again developed a swinging, septic
type of fever, and the clinical condition again deteriorated.
Hemodialysis was carried out on the 98th day and again
on the 100th day in order to prepare her for exploration
of the homograft site. The urine from the transplant
now was scanty with a greenish sediment. Retrograde
pyelograms of the homograft made on the 48th and 83rd
days demonstrated no evidence of obstruction or de￾formity. The pyelogram obtained on the 83rd day is
shown in Figure 13.
The ureter continued to remain well vascularized. The
mucosa grew out of the end of the ureter and down the
outside, until it ultimately reached the skin. As the
kidney became more involved with infection the ureter
became somewhat paler than it had been, but even on the
101st day it was obviously viable (see Figure 14).
On the 101st day the homograft site was explored.
There was a well developed membrane about 3 mm. thick
surrounding the kidney. Although it was loosely adherent
to the kidney capsule, it could be stripped off the capsule
with no great difficulty. The kidney was moderately en￾345

larged, soft, and dark brown in color. It was obviously
severely infected. The renial artery and vein and both
anastomoses were still patent, and the capsule of the
kidney bled when cut. The pedicle was clamped and the
kidney was removed.
Grossly, the kidney showed multiple cortical ab￾FIG. 15. B. B., CASE No. 4-THE CUT SURFACE OF

CORTICAL ABSCESSES
scesses and areas of infarction, with thromboses of some
of the intrinsic vessels (see Figure 15). Microscopically,
the pseudo-capsule surrounding the kidney was com￾posed of a thick layer of dense fibrous connective tis￾sue. The inner layer of this capsule, which lay against
the renal transplant, was composed of a loose vascular
stroma which resembled granulation tissue. There was
extensive focal infarction of the kidney. In some areas
thrombosis at the level of the arcuate or interlobular
arteries, with subsequent infarction, had led to the forma￾tion of abscesses. In these areas the polymorphonuclear
leukocyte was the predominant inflammatory cell. In
other areas there was a prominent interstitial round cell
infiltration. A few glomeruli showed changes resembling
subacute glomerulonephritis, but this was not a striking
lesion. The principle feature was that of focal infarction
(see Figure 16).
The patient was discharged home on the 107th hospital
day. There was some drainage from her leg wound for
a month thereafter. She lived for 7 months, during
which time a hemodialysis was performed on one
occasion.

The patient was an 18-year-old single girl whose fifth
admission was necessitated by blurring of vision. A
diagnosis of glomerulonephritis had been made 5 years
ago. In spite of treatment, her symptoms had progressed.
Physical examination: On this admission the patient
appeared pale and chronically ill. Blood pressure was
210/120. There were scattered ecchymoses over both

The heart was enlarged to the anterior axillary line.
There was a presystolic gallop rhythm. The lungs were

Hospital course: Patient was placed on a rice diet and
improved subjectively, although serum sodium values de￾creased to 126 mEq. per L. On 5-26-51 a skin flap was
raised from the right thigh as a preparation for renal
homotransplantation. An infection developed under this
flap, however, and it could not be used.
On 6-6-51, a normal kidney was removed from a 2-
year-old child during the course of an elective operation
for relief of hydrocephalus.7 The donor and recipient
were of the same blood group (0, Rh +), and their
bloods were compatible. The kidney was transplanted
into the patient's left thigh, after a period of ischemia of
65 minutes. The arteries were anastomosed end-to-end,

and the veins end-to-side. A double-ended pedicle flap
was brought over from the lateral side of the leg, as in
the previous case, and the defect was grafted with a
split thickness graft from the other leg. The ureter was
only 3 cm. long, and would not reach the skin, so a
polyethylene tube was put in the ureter and brought out
through a stab wound in the pedicle.
The transplant began to secrete urine at once, and
during the first 24 hours following operation it secreted
a total of 1,700 ml. of urine. The second 24 hours fol￾lowing operation only 153 ml. were elaborated. The
urine was blood tinged. The urine urea nitrogen con￾centration was 177 mgm. per cent. Blood urea nitrogen
at that time was 92 mgm. per cent. The patient tolerated
the procedure well. Following this, there was only a
small amount of bloody drainage from the homograft
for a period of 12 days, during which time clots could
be aspirated from the renal pelvis. The patient was given
200 mgm. testosterone propionate the first 24 hours, and
was then maintained on 50 mgm. per day for 27 days.
Cortisone, 300 mgm. per day, was given for 8 days,
and then gradually tapered off over the next 5 days.
ACTH, 100 mgm. a day, was given from the 8th to 15th
day and gradually tapered off over the next 4 days.
Heparin was begun on the 2nd day with a dose of 100
mgm. and then continued until the 11th day at a level
of 80 mgm. a day. Penicillin was given for the entire
post-operative course at various dosage levels, and other

antibiotics were added from time to time, including
Chloromyceting, streptomycin, and Terramycing.
After 12 days of almost complete anuria which fol￾lowed the short-lived diureses, the kidney began to ex￾crete urine again on the 14th day. The volume in￾creased until 1400 ml. was obtained on the 23rd day.
Maximum function occurred between the 14th and the
26th day. Thereafter the volume decreased until almost
nonie was obtained on the 37th day. It was difficult to
obtain accurate collections because of leakage around
the catheter. Analysis of the urine from the transplant
and that of the bladder urine on the 20th day is shown
in Table VI. On that day the intravenous injection of
2 ml. of PSP resulted in prompt excretion of this dye
from the homograft, but because of the difficulty in col￾lection, this could not be quantitated.
Infection developed in a hematoma beneath the right
leg flap. Cultures of paracolon bacterium aerogenies
were obtained from this source, and from the bladder
urine, transplant urine, and blood stream. The patient's
general condition deteriorated rapidly from the 41st day
on. She became comatose, developed EKG changes of
hyperkalemia, and her blood urea nitrogen rose to 261
mgm. per cent. She died on the 49th day after
transplantation.
Examination of the homograft at autopsy showed
marked hemorrhage, infarction, and infection. There
was frank abscess formation, and the inflammatory re￾sponse was primarily that of polymorphonuclear leuko￾cytosis. The pre-existing architecture of the kidney was
almost entirely destroyed by these processes, but no
evidence of glomerulonephritis could be found in the
surviving glomeruli.
Case VI-B. L., male, age 26, No. 9B64
Diagnosis: Chronic pyelonephritis.
The patient was first admitted on 7-20-51 with a 7-year
history of proteinuria. One year before admission a
diagnosis of uremia with bilaterally contracted kidneys
had been made. The blood NPN varied from 150 mgm.
per cent to 230 mgm. per cent with a persistent anemia.
He had several convulsions which had been controlled
with Dilanting before admission. Because of progres￾sive uremia and intractable kidney disease, he was trans￾ferred from the West Roxbury Veterans Hospital to
the Peter Bent Brigham Hospital for a renal homograft.
Physical examination revealed a small, pale, mentally
dull young man in no distress. The optic fundi showed
no changes. The lung fields were clear. The heart was
not enlarged; there was a grade II basal systolic mur￾mur. Blood pressure was 105/65. There were many
spontaneous twitching movements of the extremities.
Laboratory data: Urine showed a 1 + protein. There
were occasional red cells, white cells, and rare hyaline
casts in the spun sediment. The hematocrit was 26. The
white blood count was 3,350 with a normal differenitial.
The blood urea nitrogen w\,as 83 nmgm. per cent, serumii
carbon dioxide combining power 11.3 mM. per L., chlo￾ride 106 mEq. per L., sodium 140 mEq. per L. and
potassium 5 mEq. per L.
On 7-23-51 a previously normal functioning kidney re￾moved from a 33-year-old woman at an elective opera￾tion for hydrocephalus 8 was transplanted into the patient's
left thigh.9 Donor and recipient blood types were both
0, Rh +, and their blood was cross-matched and found
compatible. The period of ischemia in this case was
shortened to 14 miniutes by performing the aniastomoses
over polyethylene tubes which were temporarily tied in
place, after the technique of Hufnagel (56). Portions of
the rectus femoris and sartorius muscles were removed
to make room for the kidney, and no skin flap was used.
The patient tolerated the procedure well, and 700 ml. of
urine was elaborated from the homograft in the first 12
hours. This showed a urine urea nitrogen content of
800 mgm. per cent. Thereafter, however, no urine was
produced by the kidney. The portion of the ureter pro￾jecting beyond the skin appeared necrotic within 24
hours. For 5 days there was no appreciable tension on
the skin suture line, but after this time edema and ten￾sion became progressive.
Following the operation there was a marked rise in
the blood urea nitrogen. The patient became confused
and began to vomit. On the 3rd day, dialysis with the
artificial kidney was accomplished with marked clinical
and chemical improvement. The patient was treated with
heparin 100 to 190 mgm. per day for 12 days, and 60 to
100 mgm. per day from the 14th day through the 18th
day. No ACTH or cortisone were given. No testos￾terone was given until the 11th day at which time 50
mgm. per day was started and continued for 8 days.
His course following operations was a septic one, with

RENAL HOMOTRANSPLANTATION IN THE HUMAN
a swinging fever rising as high as 1030, for a period of
51 days following operation. This febrile course was
refractory to therapy with penicillin, Aureomycin®,
Terramycin® and Chloromycetin®.
By the 14th day, the left leg had become tremelndously
swollen and tense. On that day, the patient had a gen￾eralized tonic, clonic convulsion similar to those prior
to admission. Dilantin® therapy was again begun.
There were no further convulsions, but the patient con￾tinued to vomit and remain drowsy. On the 14th day
hemodialysis was again performed with good chemical
and clinical results. The patient continued to run a
septic fever. On the 18th day a retrograde injection
of dye into the ureter of the homograft showed no defi￾nite calcyceal pattern and suggested "marked infection
and necrosis." Blood culture on the 18th day was posi￾tive for enterococci and proteus vulgaris. On the 19th
day, the homograft site was explored. The kidney itself
appeared viable although it was surrounded by blood clots.
Because of extreme edema of the skin and tension on
the kidney an incision of the skin was made laterally
and a flap of skin and subcutaneous tissue was swung
medially to cover the transplant. The defect left by
raising the skin flap was grafted by skin taken from the
other thigh.
A biopsy of the kidney taken at operation showed
marked ischemia, but no evidence of infarction or throm￾bosis. There was a marked interstitial round cell infil￾tration which was more prominent in this case than any
of the others. The tubular changes again suggested
those of an acute ischemic nephrosis ("lower nephron
nephrosis"), with focal tubular degeneration and some
regeneration. There were pigment casts present in sev￾eral of the tubular lumena. The glomerular tufts showed
no striking abnormalities. In some areas there was an
accumulation of inflammatory cells around Bowman's
capsule (see Figure 17). The kidney appeared viable.
Within a short period of time following operation,
however, the wounds became foul and necrotic. Wound
cultures grew enterococci and B subtilis, which were re￾sistant to all but prohibitively large doses of the common
antibiotics. Proteus vulgaris, staph. aureous, and pseudo￾monias aerogenosa were also grown from the wound.
The swinging temperature continued. On the 49th day
hemodialysis was again performed because of the de￾teriorating clinical condition, and on the 52nd day, since
the homograft had produced no urine and appeared to be
the obvious site for this infection, it was removed at op￾eration. The homograft itself was covered with a thick,
fibrinopurulent exudate, and there was complete distor￾tion of the architecture with necrosis of the cortex and
most of the medulla and pyramids. Thrombosis and in￾fection were seen throughout the parenchyma.
Following the removal of the homograft there was a
dramatic improvement in the signs of sepsis, and 5 days
later the patient was transfcrred to the West Roxbury
Veterans Hospital for further chronic care. Four hours
after transfer, however, the patient suddenly exsangui￾FIG. 17. B. L., CASE No. 6-Biopsy OF THE HOMOGRAFT ON THE 19TH DAY

nated from an eroded, infected portion of the common
femoral artery just proximal to the bifurcation. Post￾mortem examination 10 showed marked chronic pyelo￾nephritis of the patient's own kidneys, and a rupture of
the common femoral artery where the wall had been
weakened by infection.
Case VII-D. G. femilalc, age 28. No. 6E373
Diagnosis: Chronic pyelonephritis, hypertension.
The patient was first admitted oni March 8, 1952. Two
years before admission she noted the onset of decreased
appetite and fatigue and had frequent upper respiratory
infections. A year before admission she noted the onset
of pallor, and six months before she had an acute epi￾sode of back pain. Two weeks before admission she was
admitted to an outside hospital where a diagniosis of hy￾pertension and kidney disease was made. Her treatment
at this hospital included three transfusions of packed red
cells. In spite of treatment, she began to vomit and had
several convulsions. Because her conditioni continued to
deteriorate, she was tranisferred to the Peter Benlt Brig￾ham Hospital for further treatment.
Physical e.raninnation at this time showed a thinl, pale,
weak woman who responded to commands, but was dis￾oriented as to time and place. The skin was dry and yel￾low. There were several ecchynioses. There was a
grade II precordial systolic murmur. Blood pressure
was 190/70. The rhythm was regular. The abdomen
was slightly distended but there was no peripheral edema.
A chest film showed the heart to be of normal size.
Laboratory data: Urine showed 1 + protein and many
white cells. Specific gravity 1.012. Culture of the urine
showed four different coliform organisms. Urine urea
nitrogen averaged 244 mgm. per cent. The 24-hour urine
volume averaged 856 ml. The hematocrit on admission
was 30 and the blood urea nitrogen, 284 mgm. per cent.
The serum carbon dioxide combining power was 11.6
mM. per L., chloride 77 mEq. per L., sodium 124 mEq.
per L., potassium 6.0 mEq. per L.
Dialysis on the artificial kidney was performed on two
occasions with marked chemical and clinical improvement.
She was discharged on the 21st hospital day. She was
re-admitted on 4-16-52 to await kidney homotransplanta￾tion.
On May 7, 1952 kidney homotransplantation was car￾ried out to the right thigh. The recipient was blood
type 0, Rh +. The donor was a 33-year-old woman
with an intra-articular septal defect and hypertension
who died during a cardiac operation. The donor's blood
type was B, Rh +. Because of the incompatibility of the
blood types, the kidney was perfused with 500 ml. of
Ringer's solution to which 25 grams of albumin and
200,000 units of penicillin had been added.
There was an accessory artery leading to the lower
pole of the donor kidney, and this had to be tied off.
The left kidney of the donor was hypoplastic, and the
10We are indebted to the Pathology Department of
the West Roxbury Veterans Hospital for the results of
this examination.
right kidney, which was used for the transplantation,
was slightly hypertrophied.
The arteries were anastomosed end-to-end, and the
veins end-to-side. A double-ended pedicle flap was
brought over as previously described, and the defect was
split-grafted. When the clamps were taken off the blood
vessels, the kidney became pink more slowly than the
previous transplants, with the exception of the second
one. This had also been performed with a kidney from
a hypertensive donor of incompatible blood type.
After about a minute, it did become pink, though not
quite as intensely pink as the previous ones. The area
of the kidney supplied by the accessory artery remained
dark blue. The blood supply of the ureter appeared ade￾quate. It was brought out through a stab wound in the
flap. A soft rubber catheter was placed in the ureter
and led out to a bottle.
Post-operatively the patienit was placed oni heparin,
160 mgm. a day, for 48 hours. Penicillin was adminis￾tered. No ACTH or cortisone was given. The patient
received testosterone from the 12th to the 19th day. By
the end of the first 48 hours a large hematoma had de￾veloped bereath the split-thickniess skin graft. Attempts
to evacuate the clot were only partially successful. He￾parin was discontinued. There was no tension on the
wound, because the wound had decompressed itself under
the skin graft.
By evening of the 3rd day the patient had developed
severe potassium intoxication. This was treated by
peritoneal lavage because of fear of increasing hemor￾rhage and potassium absorption if heparinization and
hemodialysis were used (76). The patient made a good
temporary response to this, but by the fifth day she again
showed severe hyperkalemia. A dialysis on the artificial
kidney was performed at this time. Later this same
day the patient was taken to the operating room and, un￾der a small amount of nitrous oxide, the hematoma under
the graft was evacuated and the wound packed.
Peritoneal lavage was necessary again on the 13th
day, for hyperkalemia.
The homograft excreted a few ml. of blood-tinged urine
at first, but by the end of the first 24 hours the urine was
clear. By the end of the 3rd day a total of 100 ml. had
been collected. The ureter appeared viable at this time.
On the 4th day an infarct of the ureter had apparently
developed and the urine was again slightly blood tinged.
On the 5th and 6th days the urine became more bloody,
and by the 7th day urine output had ceased. At no time
was the 24-hour volume more than 50 to 60 ml., but the
course of this transplant differed from that of the "anuric"
phase of compatible blood type grafts in that the urine be￾came bloody again after it once cleared, and then ceased
flowing entirely, instead of gradually increasing in
amount and staying clear.
On the 17th day the homograft was removed. Both
vessels were occluded by thrombus with infarction of
the kidney. There was no infection, and no appreciable
blood clot around the kidney. The host's vessels were
patent right up to the anastomoses. Histologically there
350

were changes in the walls of the large blood vessels of
the transplant, and generalized infarction of the kidney
with extersive calcification. There was no evidence of
intrinsic inflammatory or proliferative change (see
Figure 18).
Despite peritoneal dialysis on the day of operation, the
patient died 2 days later. At post-mortem examination
severe pyelonephritis with almost total destruction of
the patient's kidneys was found.
Case VIII-0. F., female, age 57, No. 7E213
Diagntosis: Periarteritis nodosa with complete anuria.
This 57-year-old woman was admitted to the Peter Bent
Brigham Hospital for the first time on 8-22-52 with a
chief complaint of anuria of 13 days' duration. She was
well until four years before when she first noted onset
of asthma, which increased in severity so that two years
before she had to be hospitalized for oxygen therapy.
In November, 1950 she received 4 days of ACTH
therapy with excellent results. In November, 1951, 9
months prior to admission, she received a 2-weeks' course
of "Pyromine." Following the last injection of this
substance she noted the rapid onset of pain, weakness,
numbness, coldness of the extremities, and periorbital
edema, associated with a temperature of 101. She was
admitted to an outside hospital where a consultant felt
that asymmetrical peripheral neuropathy suggested the
diagnosis of periarteritis nodosa. A biopsy of the right
gastrocnemius muscle confirmed this impression. A
blood urea nitrogen at this time was 6 mgm. per cent.
She was given ACTH 30 to 90 mgm. a day from De￾cember, 1951 to July, 1952, with relief of her peripheral
neuritis and asthma.
Three weeks prior to entry, following excessive ex￾posure to the sun, the patient developed a temperature of
100.8 and became fatigued and nauseated. Her urinary
output gradually diminished until she became essentially
anuric 13 days prior to entry. Ten days prior to entry
she was admitted to an outside hospital. Retrograde
pyelograms were negative. Her total urinary output for
10 days was 20 ml. Her blood urea nitrogen rose from
126 to 175, and she was transferred to the Peter Bent
Brigham Hospital for dialysis.
Physical examitnation: On admission the patient was a
pale, middle-aged woman lying quietly in bed without
complaint. Blood pressure was 155/75. The optic fundi
were unremarkable. The heart and lungs were normal.
The abdomen was moderately distended, and fluid wave
was present. The liver was felt to be somewhat en￾larged. There was 2 + pitting edema of the extremities
and sacrum. The deep tendon reflexes were hyperactive.
There was a positive Babinski on the left. Vibration
sense was diminished over the left lower leg, and there
was hyperalgesia of the left foot.
Laboratory data: Blood urea nitrogen 264 mgm. per
cent, carbon dioxide combining power 14.6 mM. per L.,
chloride 99 mEq. per L., sodium 136 mEq. per L., potas￾FIG. 18. D. G., CASE No. 7-MICROSCOPIC APPEARANCE OF THE TRANSPLANT AT POST-MORTEM

41ST DAY OF ANURIA, 4 DAYS BEFORE RENAL HOMOTRANSPLANTATION WAS DONE

sium 6.1 mEq. per L., hematocrit 19, white blood count
8,600 with 89 per cent polymorphonuclear leukocytes.
Hospital course: A catheter was inserted in the fe￾moral vein and the patient was begun on 50 per cent glu￾cose 400 to 700 ml. a day. On the 3rd day she had a
convulsion, and on the following day hemodialysis was
carried out with good clinical improvement. She con￾tinued to be anuric, and she was again dialyzed because
of progressive signs of uremia on 9-4-52 and on 9-16-52,
each time with good response. On 9-18-52 a biopsy of
the left kidney was carried out.1' This showed severe
renal damage. The proliferative and inflammatory
changes were so pronounced in some areas as virtually
to eliminate the glomerular architecture (see Figure 19).
A moderate number of inflammatory cells were present
around the glomeruli. The picture was felt to be con￾sistent with marked periarteritis of the kidney. On 9-22,
the 45th day of anuria, a kidney homotransplant to the
left thigh was performed. The donor was a patient with
ruptured sinus of Valsalva who died during a cardiac
operation. The blood types of the donor and recipient
were both 0, Rh +, and their bloods were compatible.
The left kidney of the donor was used, and an end-to-end
anastomosis was made between the profunda femoris ar￾tery and the renal artery, and an end-to-side anastomosis
11This operation was performed by Dr. J. Hartwell
Harrison,
was made between the renal vein and the common fe￾moral vein. The kidney was not perfused. The period
of ischemia was 275 minutes.12 No heparin was injected.
Circulation through the kidney appeared excellent, and
the color of the transplant became normal as quickly as
any we have done. Peristaltic waves were seen in the
ureter, and the blood supply to the tip of the ureter ap￾peared normal.
A pocket was created medially in the usual fashion,
and a double-ended pedicle flap was used to cover the
kidney. The fascia lata was covered with a split thick￾ness graft taken from the abdomen. The ureter was
brought out through a stab wound in the flap, and a
soft rubber catheter was inserted in it.
Post-operatively the patient was treated with heparin
90 mgm. in the first 18 hours, then 160 mgm. per day for
7 days, gradually tapering it off from the 7th to the 10th
day. She was placed on ACTH 100 mgm. a day I-M for
5 days, then 25 mgm. I-V over an 8-hour period for 2
days, and then 20 mgm. ACTH gel twice a day through
the 19th day. It was gradually tapered off from the
19th to the 22nd day. The first 24 hours she was given
200 mgm. testosterone, and thereafter she received 50
mgm. a day for 12 days, and 50 mgm. every other day
12This long period of ischemia was occasioned by a
delay in obtaining the donor kidney.

from the 13th to the 38th day. Penicillin, streptomycin,
and Terramycing were given at various times.
The patient's only food, except for an occasional cup
of tea, was 200 to 700 ml. (usually 400 to 500 ml.) per
day of 50 per cent glucose given I-V via the femoral
catheter over the course of 24 hours. She received one
transfusion of washed red blood cells on the 10th day.
For 83 days she had essentially no protein or fat intake.
Daily electrocardiograms, were taken, and these plus the
patient's clinical status were used to determine when
hemodialysis was to be done.
There was no edema of the leg in which the kidney
was implanted, although a hematoma formed under the
split-thickness skin graft. The wound through which
her own kidney had been biopsied never entirely healed,
nor did the skin graft donor site or the skin graft heal.
The wound in the thigh only partially healed, there be￾ing some necrosis of the upper aspect. A small collec￾tion of pus was aspirated through a needle from the lower
end of the leg wound, but there was surprisingly little
infection present.
By the 3rd post-operative day the end of the ureter
had become black and dry. Only a few milliliters of
bloody fluid came through the catheter, and no function
of the transplant developed.
The patient ran a sub-normal temperature (95.20 to
97.20) from the time of the operation until the 6th post￾operative day, when she was dialyzed. Her temperature
rose to 98.60 following the dialysis, and persisted at a

low normal range (96.60 to 98.6°) until the 2nd post￾operative dialysis on the 15th day, at which time it rose
to 99.80. It then remained within normal range until
the 32nd day, at which time it again became sub-normal.
It gradually went down, until during the last 24 hours
it was too low to record on standard clinical thermom￾eters. The patient died quietly on the 38th post-operative
day, the 83rd day of complete anuria, the 23rd day since
the last dialysis. Prior to the 22nd post-operative day
the patient was communicative and pleasant, reading dur￾ing the day, and having no complaints. On the 22nd day
she began having seizures, followed by semi-coma. The
blood urea nitrogen at that time was 119, serum potas￾sium 5.1, hematocrit 19. From this time until the time
of death the patient was semi-comatose. A blood urea
nitrogen on the 32nd day was 204, and a white blood
count and hematocrit on this day were 3,850 and 15, re￾spectively. An electrocardiogram on the 33rd day showed
no evidence of hyperkalemia, but one taken on the 38th
day shortly before death showed definite changes of
hyperkalemia.
At post-mortem examination there were several very
remarkable findings. The kidney biopsy site and the skin
graft donor site on the abdomen were very poorly healed.
The skin graft over the lateral aspect of the leg had com￾pletely sloughed away. The medial leg wound had only
weakly healed, and there was some necrosis at the upper
end.
When the wound was opened it was very easy to strip
the subcutaneous tissues away from the kidney, there be￾ing very little reaction between host and the graft. The
blood vessels were easily identified, and there was very
little reaction around them. There was a small, com￾pletely organized, non-occluding clot in the common
femoral vein just below the inguinal ligament where a
bulldog clamp had been applied during the operation.
The transplant appeared normal in size, and there was no
significant infection around it.
The cut surface of the kidney appeared normal, ex￾cept that there were multiple pin-point, brownish-red
spots scattered throughout the cortex (see Figure 20).
The patient's own kidneys showed almost no recognizable
normal architecture on cut section.
The microscopic findings were as follows:
A. The transplanted kidney: Unlike Cases No. 1 and
No. 2, there was no pseudocapsule present (see Figure
21). There were no thromboses or infarcts present.
There was a striking proliferation of the parietal epi￾thelial layer of Bowman's capsule and of the epithelium
of adjacent capillary loops, leading to marked "crescent"
formation. The rest of the tuft was contracted and rela￾tively bloodless (see Figures 22 and 23). These findings
354

RENAL HOMOTRANSPLANTAT1ON IN THE HUMAN
were compatible with a severe acute glomerulonephritis.
The tubules showed vacuolation of the epithelium, and in
some instances there was recently extravasated blood in
the lumen. There were areas of tubular degeneration
with calcification and also of tubular repair. There was
very little round cell infiltration.
B. The con tralateral donor kidncey: At the time of
transplantation both of the donor's kidneys appeared simi￾lar, and grossly normal. The kidney which was not
used for transplantation was examined microscopically.
It appeared normal, and there was no evidence of glo￾merular disease.
C. The paticnt's ozen kidnieys: Proliferative and in￾flammatory changes had almost completely destroyed
the glomeruli. The tubules were atrophic. Periglomeru￾lar inflammatory cells were less conspicuous than in the
biopsy specimen (see Figure 24).
Commizent: The transplanted kidney had developed, in
38 days, glomerular changes of such magnitude that it
was never able to elaborate urine. Presumably these
glomerular changes began during the anuric phase fol￾lowing transplantationi, and were well enough developed at
the end of this time to prevent recovery of function.
No changes diagnostic of periarteritis were seen in the
transplant, but the large doses of ACTH post-operatively
may have been enough to arrest these, as it apparently
had elsewhere in the patient. It failed to halt the glo￾merular damage, however, just as it had failed in the
case of the patient's own kidneys.
The failure of this recipient to react violently locally
to the transplant is in marked contrast to Case No. 4.
This may have been due to the protracted anuria and
lack of adequate caloric and protein intake, and it cor￾relates well with the failure of the wounds to heal, and
the lack of clotting in the blood vessels. On the other
hand, the severe glomerular changes are in marked con￾trast to the other cases reported here, where tubular
destruction, thromboses of small blood vessels Nithin the
kidney substance, and infection were the predominant
changes. Since this patient had a severe, generalized,
allergic disease, it is tempting to postulate that these glo￾merular changes were the consequence of this disease.

admission he was found to have a blood pressure of 160/
100 and a blood urea nitrogen of 30. At this time he
noted the onset of ankle edema at night and moderate
periorbital edema. Two months prior to admission he had
a severe headache and developed visual changes which
were found on funduscopic examination to be due to
retinal hemorrhages. He was hospitalized elsewhere at
this time and his blood urea nitrogen was found to be
114 mgm. per cent, and his blood pressure 200/120. He
had several days of gross hematuria and noted occasional
nausea and vomiting. He was given three transfusions
and was placed on a low protein, low salt diet. He en￾tered the Peter Bent Brigham Hospital for a considera￾tion of renal transplantation.
Physical examination: The patient was a pale young
man with definite periorbital edema. Blood pressure
was 188/118. The optic fundi showed A-V nicking with
arteriolar narrowing and irregularity. Both discs were
blurred, and there were hemorrhages and exudates in
both eyes. Lungs were clear. There was a Grade II
apical systolic murmur. There was generalized lymph￾adenopathy.
Laboratory data: Blood urea nitrogen 65 to 80 mgm.

9,200 with a normal differential. Urinalysis revealed a
specific gravity of 1.006, and there was 2+ proteinuria.
Microscopic examination revealed 40 to 60 red blood
cells and 8 to 10 white blood cells per high power field.
There was fine granular casts. PSP excretion was 7
per cent in two hours. A chest x-ray was negative.
Hospital course: On November 6, 1952, the 21st hos￾pital day, an operation was carried out to outline the
skin flap on the right leg in preparation for doing a re￾nal homotransplant. It was decided to create the flap
in advance on this patient because his thigh was very
thin and it was felt that the pedicle graft would not stand
up under the increased tension that is developed when a
renal transplant is placed in the thigh. The patient was
discharged eight days later. Sixteen days later the pa￾tient was re-admitted and on December 3, 1952 the skin
flap was elevated and then laid back down and resutured
in place. The blood urea nitrogen prior to this operation
was 76. Four days after this operation the patient was
discharged again to await kidney transplantation.
He was re-admitted on February 11, 1953 and a renal
transplantation to the right thigh was carried out at this
time. The donor was a patient with mitral and aortic
stenosis who died during a cardiac operation. The blood
types of both the donor and recipient were A, Rh +,
and their bloods were compatible. Although we prefer to
put the right kidney in the right thigh, the blood vessels
of this kidney were not suitable for use and therefore
356

RENAL HOMOTRANSPLANTATION IN THE HUMAN
the left kidney was used. The kidney was placed in a
polyethylene bag, which had been made especially for this
purpose, and the artery, vein, and ureter were each
brought out through small holes in the bottom of the bag.
An end-to-end anastomosis was done between the pro￾funda femoris and the renal artery, and an end-to-side
anastomosis was made between the renal vein and the
common femoral vein. The kidney was not perfused.
The period of ischemia was 180 minutes. No heparin
was injected. Circulation through the kidney appeared
excellent. Peristaltic waves could be seen in the ureter,
and the blood supply to the tip of the ureter appeared
excellent. After all the bleeding points which could be
seen on the kidney capsule were secured, the open end
of the bag was sealed shut with the cautery. The bag
was loose around the kidney and in no way constricted
it (see Figure 25).
A pocket was created medially in the usual fashion and
the previously outlined skin flap was again raised and
was used to cover the kidney. The fascia lata was cov￾ered with two split-thickness grafts taken from the left
thigh. The ureter was brought out through a stab wound

in the flap and a soft rubber catheter was inserted in it.
Because the left kidney was used, a U-shaped loop had to
be made in the ureter. There was a large amount of
oozing frcm the wound and therefore a perforated
catheter was brought out through the lower end of the
medial incision and connected to \Vangensteen suction.
Post-operatively the patient was given 200 mgm. of
testosterone in the first 24 hours and then 50 mgm. daily
from then on for the next 62 days. No ACTH, corti￾sone, or heparin were given. Peniicillin, streptomycin,
Aureomycin®, and Terramycing were used at various
times. The patient was p)laced on Terramycin(g on the
29th post-operative day and was maintained on a dose of
1.0 gm. a day to the 145th day.
For the first two clays post-operatively there was
profuse bloody drainage from the operative site through
the catheter that had beeni placed in the wound. By the
third day the drainage had almost stopped, and the
catheter was removed to prevent infection. The bleeding
had not stopped, however, and although the patient was
ordinarily hypertensive, by the 5th day his blood pres￾sure had fallen to shock levels. His hematocrit, which
had been 32 onI the 2nd day, had fallen to 17 by the 5th
day. His thigh was moderately swollen. The patient was
given protamine sulfate (although no heparin had been
used), vitamin K, and fresh blood transfusions in an effort
to decrease his tendency to bleed. For the next two
days he continued to ooze, however, and by the morning
of the 8th day he was in a precarious state. He had re￾ceived seven blood transfusions. His hematocrit, which
had been raised to 22 with the transfusions, had again
dropped to 17. His transplant had produced no urine,
and the output of his own kidneys had fallen to 300 ml.
(total) for the preceding two days. His thigh was tre￾mendously swollen. The blood urea nitrogen had risen
to 166 mgm. per cent, and the serum sodium had fallen
to 124 mEq. per L.
The dressings were enitirely removed from the leg.
The suture line between the split-thickness skin grafts
and the pedicle flap had been separated and a large blood
clot was lifting the pedicle flal) off the anterior thigh
muscles and the renal tranisplant. The tip of the ureter
still appeared to have excellent circulation, however, and
the two split skin grafts had entirely taken, having been
saved by a stint which was tied in place over them. The
pedicle flap, also, was of excellent color. The lateral
portion of the hematoma was lifted out of the opening in
the wound, and its volume was estimated at about 1000
ml. After its removal the transplanted kidney in its
polyethylene covering could be seen presenting in the
opening in the lateral aspect of the wound, pushed over
by hematoma medial to it.
The medial wound was re-opened at operation. Blood
clot amounting to an estimated 2000 ml. was removed.
The kidney and ureter appeared viable. A small rip,
about 2 cm. in length, had occurred in the margin of the
polyethylene bag which had been sealed with the cautery.
An adhesion between subcutaneous tissue and kidney
capsule had occurred through this opening. The adhe￾sion was broken. The transplant was placed back in its
medial position. The lateral margin of the pedicle flap
was resutured to the split graft. The wound oozed from
every surface, and it was impossible to control the bleed￾ing completely. The medial portion of the wound was
closed around three Penrose drains. The catheter was
left in the ureter.
Following this operation, the patient's conditioni re￾mained poor for several days. His blood urea nitrogen
rose to 244 mgm. per cent on the 19th day after trans￾plantation, the 11th day after the evacuation of the he￾matoma. Gradually the bleeding from the wound slowed
down and stopped, and the drains were removed 15 days
after the second operation. At this time the polyethylenie
bag could be seen through one of the drain holes.
For 11 days the transplant put out lno urine. Then
from the 12th to the 18th day it put out from 5 to 26 ml.
daily. On the 19th day it began to "open up," producing
75 ml., and for the next 5 days it produced gradually in￾creasing amounts. From the 24th to the 30th day it
reached a plateau of around 400 ml. daily. This was
interesting in view of the fact that the other three trans￾plants with measurable function reached their maximal
urine output from the 13th to the 28th day. The output
continued to increase until, on the 37th day, a 24-hour
output of 1,000 ml. was reached, and from this time on
the transplant elaborated 1,000 to 3,000 ml. a day until
the sudden events which led to the patient's demise 6
months after the transplantation.
On the 28th day the catheter was removed from the
ureter, since peristaltic waves were producing leakage of
urine around the catheter. A ureterostomy cup Mwas
glued to the skin around the ureter, and the urine drained
from here into a bag which was strapped to the patient's
thigh (see Figures 26 and 27). The cup was changed
every three weeks.
There was a considerable amount of thin purulent
drainage from the drain sites in the medial wouind. This
cultured micrococci and A. acrogenes which were some￾what sensitive to Aureomycin®i and Terramycin®. The
patient was given both drugs at various times, but proved
to tolerate Terramycin® better, and so w,as maintained
on this ulntil the 145th day. The three drain sites healed
until only a small opening was present at the superior
site, just below the inguinal ligament. A small amount
of drainage persisted at this location until the 148th day,
at which time all drainage stopped andl the wound closed
entirely.
The patient was gradually mobilized. His appetite re￾turned, and he gained weight. His blood urea nitrogen
decreased and his hematocrit rose. He learned to take
care of his ureterostomy very well. On the 81st day after
the transplantation he was discharged home. From this
time on, he returned every two to three weeks for brief
periods of hospitalization for study. His appetite re￾mained good, and he ultimately felt better than he ha(l
for years.
Kidney function studies were done at frequent intervals.
They are summarized in the following paragraphs, to￾gether with notes of other observations which were of in￾terest to us.

The ureterostomy cup is glued in place, and the collecting bag is strapped
to the patient's leg. The graft site can be seen just beneath the cup.
1. Excretion of metabolites and electrolytes
In Table VII a comparison is made between trans￾plant and bladder urine at representative periods through￾out the patient's course, together with blood studies dur￾ing the same period. It may be seen that the transplanted
kidney, once its function reached a steady plateau, ex￾creted more metabolites than both host kidneys. On the
65th day, for example, the patient's own kidneys to￾gether put out 2.4 gm. of urea nitrogen in 24 hours,
while the transplant excreted 6.8 gm. The total urea
nitrogen output was 9.2 gm., which corresponds to an
output of about 18.4 gm. of urea. This would be at the
lower limits of normal range (15 to 35 gm.) on an aver￾age protein intake. The urea clearance of the transplant
(x2) on this day was 16 ml. per min. The function of
the transplanted kidney with respect to the clearance of
urea was thus about 25 per cent of normal.
On the 74th day the total 24-hour creatinine excretion
in the bladder urine was 253 mgm., while in the urine
from the transplant it was 1,000 mgm. The normal 24-
hour output of creatinine for a man of this size is 1.2 to
1.7 gm.
The total nitrogen output of the transplanted kidney
consistently ran about twice that of the total output in
the bladder urine.
The potassium excretion of the transplanted kidney
was greater than that in the bladder urine, and was
within normal limits. The sodium and chloride excretion
of both the transplant and bladder urine was quite low.
The pH of the bladder urine ran between 4.7 and
5.3. The pH of the transplant urine began at 5.6 on
the 37th day and rose to 7.2 by the 71st day.
There was no sugar in the urine.
2. Concentration and dilution tests
The specific gravity of the bladder urine was about
1.007, and that of the transplant varied between 1.005 and
1.012. A concentration test carried out on the 53rd day
showed no significant ability of either the transplant or
the host kidney to respond with increases in specific
gravity. The specific gravity of host and transplant
urine fell with increased fluid intake. (See also Pitui￾tring test).

3. PSP and aminiophyllin tests
Phenolsulphonephthalein tests were done on two oc￾casions. On the 28th day the total output of dye in two
hours' time from the bladder was 2 per cent, and from
the transplanted kidney 4 per cent. On the 39th day
the bladder urine contained 7.5 per cent, and the trans￾plant 5 per cent. The urinary output of the transplanted
kidney increased markedly following the I-V injection
of aminophyllin.
4. Clearance studies13
Studies of renal clearance were done on three separate
occasions, (Tables VIII, IX, and X), on the 58th, the
103rd, and the 153rd day, respectively. While the clear￾ance of inulin and PAH are difficult to interpret in re￾nal disease as far advanced as this, nevertheless under
comparable circumstances, the function of the trans￾planted kidney in these parameters was better than
both of the host kidneys combinied. It is also of interest
that the function of the transplant was continuing to im￾prove at least as late as the 153rd day, when the last
test was done. The lowering of the blood urea nitrogen
13 These were kindly carried out for us by Dr. John
Finkenstaedt.
further attests to the fact that the transplanted kidney was
improving the patient's excretory ability.
5. Pitressin® test 14
On the 50th day a Pitressin® test was carried out in
the following manner: With a water load of 20 ml. per
Kg., maximal diuresis ensued. This amounted to 2.0 ml.
per min. for the patient's own kidneys (combined), and
3.0 ml. per min. for the transplant. The specific gravity
of both urines fell from 1.007 to 1.001. After the control
period, 15 milliunits of Pitressin® was given intrave￾nously. The maximal decrease in minute output
amounted to 65 per cent for the patient's own kidneys,
and 70 per cent for the transplanted kidney. The maxi￾mal specific gravity was 1.006 for the patient's own kid￾neys and 1.010 for the transplant. The chloride con￾centration of the bladder urine increased from an average
of 26.5 mEq. per L. during maximal diuresis to a maxi￾mum of 37.0 mEq. per L. following the administration of
Pitressing, and that of the transplant increased from
an average of 16.9 mEq. per L. to a maximum of 33.4
mEq. per L.
14 We are indebted to Dr. Joseph Dingman for this
study.

It would thus appear that all kidneys were able to re￾spond somewhat to water loading and that the degree
of concentration following the administration of Pitres￾sin®, while sub-normal, was slightly greater in the case
of the transplanted kidney than the host's kidneys.
6. Urinary sediment
Urine sediment was evaluated at intervals by the
semi-quantitative method of Addis (1). Transplant
and bladder urine both consistently showed many white
and red blood cells, but only the urine from the bladder
showed casts. A typical count is that carried out on
the 71st day:

7. Output of adrenal cortical hormones, and their effect
on electrolyte excretion.15
Studies were carried out on the excretion of adrenal
cortical hormones in transplant and bladder urine, and
their effect on the excretion of electrolytes, creatinine,
and uric acid. These results may be summarized as
follows:
a) After the 51st day the transplant excreted some￾what greater amounts of both 17-ketosteroids and 17-
hydroxysteroids than were obtained in the bladder urine.
b) The output of 17-hydroxysteroid was increased
markedly in both bladder and transplant urine after the
administration of 150 mgm. of hydrocortisone.
c) A similar increase in the output of 17-hydroxy￾steroids was seen after the administration of 100 mgm.
of tetrahydrocortisone.
15We are indebted to Drs. John C. Laidlaw and Dal￾ton Jenkins for these studies.
d) Hydrocortisone, 150 mgm., was infused intrave￾nously over a 12-hour period. A decreased excretion of
sodium, and increased secretions of potassium, chloride,
creatinine, and uric acid were noted in the urine from
both transplant and host kidneys. These changes were
more marked in the urine from the transplanted kidney.
8. Complement titre in peripheral blood 16
No significant change in complement titre was noted
in the post-operative period.
9. Hypertension
The patient's hypertension persisted unabated, the
transplant having no noticeable effect on it.
10. The appearance of the ureter
The appearance of the tip of the ureter may provide
a clue to the condition of the renal circulation, because
its entire vascular supply comes from the renal vessels.
In Case No. 4, for example, with focal infarction of the
kidney the color of the ureter, which had been bright red,
became an unhealthy pink. In Case No. 7, with ex￾tensive infarction of the kidney, the ureter became black.
In Case No. 9 the ureter continued to look a healthy
red, month after month (see Figure 28). Peristaltic
waves could be seen involving the tip, and urine was
spurted out of the ureter by the force of these waves
(see Figure 29).
11. Other considerations
The location of the kidney did not interfere with the
patient's ambulation. The polyethylene covering did per￾mit the kidney to slide about some under the flap, how￾ever. The patient noticed at an early stage that if he
lay well over on his right side the kidney would some￾times slide over and kink the ureter, producing a tem￾porary obstruction. Turning back to the other side
would produce a gush of urine. He made every attempt
not to sleep on the right side, but the possibility exists
that some intermittent obstruction may have occurred
when the patient inadvertently rolled over to this side.
On the 153rd day the patient returned to the hospital
for a routine check. At that time he was feeling very
well, and expressed a desire to get a job. His ap￾petite was excellent, he had gained weight, and his blood
urea nitrogen was down to 34 mgm. per cent, the lowest
value we had ever obtained on this patient. His hemato￾crit had risen to 41, and the blood uric acid had de￾creased to 6.8 mgm. per cent. The transplant was pro￾ducing 1,500 to 2,000 ml. of urine daily. The ureter ap￾peared of excellent color, as always.
The patient continued to exhibit a severe hypertension
of 200-240/120-140. He had been receiving Dibenzyline®,
20 mgm. a day, during most of the time since the trans￾plantation, but it had not been possible to control the
hypertension with this drug. On the 100th day after
the transplant, rauwolfia serpentina, two tablets daily of

crude extract, was added without noticeable effect. It
was decided, therefore, during this hospitalization to in￾crease the dose of rauwolfia. The dose was increased
from two to four tablets a day. No significant depres￾sion of the blood pressure was noted. On the 7th day of
this hospitalization (the 160th post-transplant day)
Apresoline® was added in doses up to 150 mgm. a day.
On the 9th hospital day the patient noted a slight swelling
of the kidney transplant area in the right thigh. By the
following day this was definitely noticeable, and the pa￾tient had developed a fever of 100.5 degrees. The trans￾plant urine, which had previously contained from 2 to 4
white blood cells per high power field, now contained
from 80 to 100. A urine culture showed Ps. aeruginosa
and A. aerogenes. The patient was placed on Chloro￾mycetin®D, 2.0 gm. a day.
On the 13th hospital day the patient developed wheez￾ing respiration, and physical examination revealed rales
and dullness over both lung bases. On the following day
the patient coughed up sputum streaked with bright red
blood, and a chest x-ray at this time showed a bilateral
hydrothorax with increased vascular markings. It was
felt that the findings of swelling of the transplant, hy￾drothorax, and blood-streaked sputum were compatible
with pulmonary emboli originafing from the right femoral
vein in proximity to the anastomosis of the transplant
vein. The patient was started on heparin therapy.
On the 16th day a pleural friction rub was heard over
the right posterior chest. The patient continued to run
a spiking fever and to have tachycardia and tachypnea.
On the 18th day a pericardial friction rub was noted
over the apex. There was pitting edema of the skin over￾lying the renal homograft, and the output of the trans￾plant had dropped down to around 500 ml. a day. It was
decided on this day to explore the right iliac vessels
above the graft anastomosis site to see if thrombophle￾bitis of these vessels was present.Y7 At exploration the
iliac veins were found to be soft and pliable and there was
no evidence of thrombosis or inflammatory process.
On the day following the exploration the urinary
output of the transplant, and of the host kidneys as well,
dropped off still further. The patient began to vomit
coffee ground material and to complain of mid-epigastric
pain. Heparin therapy was therefore discontinued. The
hematocrit had fallen to 24 by the 22nd day.
The white blood count, which had reached levels of
14,000, came down to 6,000, and the temperature became
niormal from the 19th day on. The blood urea nitrogen
continued to rise, however, and had reached 260 mgm. per
cent by the 23rd day. The serum potassium gradually
rose. The patient became disoriented and died on
8-6-53, the 23rd day of the last hospitalization, and 5 days
short of 6 months from the time of the transplantation.
A complete post-mortem examination was carried out.
There was no demonstrable myocardial infarct, but the
myocardium was hypertrophied and dilated, and there
was a fibrinous pericarditis. There were bilateral pleural
effusions, and a fibrinous pleurisy on the right. The
lungs were edematous, and there was atelectasis of the
posterior portions of the lower lobes bilaterally. No
evidence of pulmonary emboli could be found, however.
Altered blood was found in the stomach and intestines, but
no definite bleeding point was seen.
The patient's own kidneys were markedly contracted,
weighing 70 grams each. Microscopically they showed
chronic glomerulonephritis of a severe degree.
The renal homograft was extremely interesting. Only
the central portion of the kidney was still encased in the
bag, the two ends of the plastic sac having become torn

An incision has been made through the scar of the original wound. The ureteral stoma can
be seen on the anterior surface of the thigh. The polyethylene sac encloses a broad segment
of the mid-portion of the kidney. Portions of the upper and lower poles are uncovered by the
sac and are in contact with host tissues.
(see figures 30-32). In spite of this, there were very few
adhesions over even the uncovered portion of the kidney,
perhaps because it moved back and forth under the skin.
There was an acute angulation of the ureter 6 cm. from
the ureterostomy, with some dilatation above this point.
This was consistent with the intermittent obstruction
noted by the patient when lying on his right side, and
was certainly not the cause either of the renal enlarge￾ment or the subsequent oliguria.
The transplant was swollen, pale, and mottled, and
the cut surface bulged somewhat-findings felt to be

cellular infiltration of the interstitial tissue in this zone
(see Figure 36). These changes were not observed in the
deeper layers of the cortex, or in the outer cortex which
was uncovered by the bag, and apparently represent a
direct reaction to the bag itself. The band of destruction
was narrow enough not to constitute a contra-indication
to the use of a bag, if such a procedure were shown to
have merit. The glomeruli, with the exception of those
just mentioned, appeared somewhat ischemic, but other￾wise essentially normal (see Figures 37, 42, and 43).
Most of the tubules in the cortex and medulla appeared
atrophic in some degree. This was noted most strikingly
in the convoluted tubules. Some of the tubules showed
casts, and recent degenerative alterations. There was in￾terstitial edema, and focal areas of round cell infiltration

they were anastomosed. In three instances the
small size of the kidney vessels may have been the
result of severe mitral stenosis in the donor. In
the fourth case the kidney was obtained from a
child. 2) All of the patients received testosterone
in the immediate post-operative period and for 27
to 62 days thereafter. 3) The blood types of donor
and recipient were the sanme and the bloods cross￾matched. 4) All of the kidneys went through a
period of anuria from 81/2 to 19 days in duration
before opening up and beginning to produce urine.
One of the kidneys secreted urine for 24 hours
before becoming anuric. 5) During the period of
maximal performance, each of the four trans￾planted kidneys developed function which was bet￾ter than that of the recipient's own.
Beyond these five similarities, there were strik￾ing differences between the first three functioning
transplants and the fourth one. The first three

In eight of the nine cases the homotransplanta￾tion was performed in the thigh with anastomosis
of the renal vessels with the femoral vessels, and
the construction of a skin ureterostomy. Four of
these homografts developed measurable function.
Despite the small number of cases there are cer￾tain similarities between these four which are
worth noting. 1) All of the kidneys were small
and had vessels whose diameters were equal to or
less than those of the femoral vessels to which

The fourth functioning renal transplant (Case
No. 9) was placed in a polyethylene bag at the
time of transplantation. No ACTH or cortisone
were given. Maximal function was not reached
until the 37th day-a time at which the function
of the other transplants was already declining￾and the function persisted without diminishing
for over 5 months from the time of transplantation.
The blood urea nitrogen came down progressively
from a high of 244 mgm. per cent on the 19th day
after the transplantation to a low of 34 mgm. per
cent on the 153rd day. Following the failure of
the transplant the blood urea nitrogen rapidly
rose, over a period of two weeks, to reach a high
of 260 mgm. per cent on the day the patient
expired.
At necropsy the polyethylene bag was found to
be intact over the central portion of the kidney,

cases received ACTH and cortisone post-opera￾tively. They all achieved maximum function be￾tween the 2nd and 4th week after transplantation.
and the urine volume and excretion of metabolites
fell off rapidly following this l)eriod. The final de￾structive processes appeared to consist of cortical
ischemia, tubular degeneration, and interstitial
edema and round cell infiltration. This was fol￾lowed by scattered thromboses of the small in￾trinsic renal vessels with associated focal infarcts.
All three transplants ultimately became heavily
infected. The glomeruli appeared to be relatively
uninvolved, except for ischemia, until the de￾struction of the kidney by infection was nearly

the terminal stage of the other two cases.

but to be torn over both poles. The microscopic
findings in this kidney were somewhat different
from the other three cases. The tubules showed
signs of acute ischemic nephrosis, and there was
interstitial edema and focal cell infiltration as in
the other cases. There was, however, no signifi￾cant infection, no thrombosis, no infarct, and no
necrosis. The blood vessels had developed a
severe degree of intimal thickening. There was

the kidney which were not covered by the bag.

nothing shortly after that. Total infarction of the
kidney ultimately occurred, necessitating removal
on the 17th day. Unfortunately this was not a
"pure" experiment and we cannot be sure that we
can attribute the failure to the blood incompati￾bility. The following variables may also have
played a part: 1) The donor was a hypertensive
patient, as was the donor in Case 2. In neither of
these two cases did the immediate circulation of
the transplant seem to be quite as good as in the
others; 2) The kidney was perfused, as was the
kidney in Case 2. This was done because of the
blood incompatibility. None of the other kidneys
was perfused; 3) There was an anomalous vessel
going to the lower pole of this kidney and when
the circulation had been re-established, the por￾tion of the kidney supplied by this vessel remained
dark and in obvious danger of infarction; 4) No
cortisone, ACTH, or testosterone was given to
this patient, in contrast to most of the others.
In Case No. 6, local edema, hemorrhage, and
pressure seemed to have contributed to failure of
the graft, which was finally destroyed by infection
and infarction.
In Case No. 8, the recipient's uremia was on
the basis of periarteritis nodosa. She had been
completely anuric (and maintained by dialysis of
the artificial kidney) for 45 days at the time of
transplantation. A biopsy of her left kidney prior
to the transplantation showed severe renal damage,
with inflammatory changes in the walls of the
blood vessels, hypercellularity and hyalinization
of the glomeruli.
Following the transplantation the patient re￾mained anuric (maintained by dialysis) and with￾out function from the homograft until her demise
38 days later. At post-mortem a severe glomeru￾lonephritis was seen to have developed in the
transplanted kidney, although there was no throm￾bosis, no infarction, and no significant infection.
There was tubular damage, and hemorrhage had
occurred into the lumina of many of the tubules.
There was very little interstitial round cell infil￾tration, however, and no periarterial lesions were
present. The glomerular damage seemed to domi￾nate the picture here, the other changes appearing
to be secondary to the glomerular damage and
the anoxia at the time of transplantation. These
changes had apparently developed in 38 days, as
the other kidney of the donor was examined mi￾croscopically and found to be normal, so that the
homograft is presumed to have been normal at the
time of transplantation. The changes were prob￾ably well developed within two weeks or less, be￾cause, had they not been, the transplant would
have been expected to "open up" after the initial
post-operative anuric phase. This picture of the
pathology was in marked contrast to that seen in
any of the other cases.

Rich and Gregory (107) produced typical

tivity. Acute, diffuse glomerulonephritis oc￾curred in a number of these animals.
The glomerulonephritis which involved first the
recipient's kidneys and later the transplanted kid￾ney, in Case No. 8, appears, likewise, to have had
its origin in a hypersensitive state induced by the
injections of a foreign protein. In this case some
of the clinical miianifestations of the disease were
ameliorated by the prolonged admiiinistration of
ACTH. Progressive renal (lamiiage occurred,
however, while other tissues wvere being spared￾an observation miiade as well in other cases of
periarteritis treated with ACTH. The terminal
phases of destruction of the patient's own kidneys
appear to have occurre(l quite rapidly. after a long
perio(l of slowly progressive changes-perhaps
because the antil)odv titre studkdenly- increased.
rhe dlestructioin of the transplanted kidney, in any
event, was very rapid.
Simiionsen (119-121 ) (lescril)es v-ascular changes
in (log renal holmiotrauisplants which he regards
as an "experimentally pro(luced periarteritis
nodosa." The glomiieruli of these kidneys appear
normal. No changes resembling periarteritis
nodosa were seen in any of our other humiian
transplants.
It is worth pointing otit that Case No. 8 was
the only one of our cases showing anx! evidence of
primary glomerular involvement. In the experi￾mental work on the pathogenesis of glomerulo￾nephritis reference is made to the role of anti￾gen-antibody reactions as possible etiologic fac￾tors in this disease. A brief mention of this work
is pertinent to a (liscussion of the cases reported
here.
Anti-kidney antibodies can be produced in one
species of animiial by the injection of kidney ho￾mogenates from another species. A "nephrotoxic
glomerulonephritis" is produced when this heter￾ologous kidney antiserum is injected back into an
animal of the species originally donating the kid￾ney tissue (79. 88, 122). No such anti-kidney
antibodies have been produced by the injection of
homologous kidiney homiiogenates alone, although
Schwentker and Comploier (112) described their
production following the injection of a mixture of
homologous kidney tissue and bacterial toxin, and
Hedlund (52) achieved similar results with ho￾mologous kidney tissue plus hemolytic streptococ￾cus. Cavelti and Cavelti (24-26) have proposed
a theory for the origin of human glomiierulo￾nephritis which postulates that streptococcal in￾fection may convert kidney tissue into an antigenic
form, permitting the development of anti-kidney
auto-antibodies. Humphrey (60) was unable t￾confirm this work Lange, Gold, Weiner, and
Simon (71) found auto-antibodies to humilan kid￾niev tissue in patients with glomerulonephlritis,
ev-en in the chronic stage, and Lippman, Canmeron.
and Campbell (78) foundl a circulating nephro￾toxic substance in patients with glomiierulonephri￾tis.
It is of note that no changes of glomerulonephri￾tis wNere seen in the two renal transplants which
were performed by us in patients with chronic
gloimerulonephritis. This was true in spite of the
fact that the homotransplaint persisted in one of
the cases for a period far longer than that which
was necessary for the developmeint of the glomeru￾lonephritis in Case No. 8. It is possible that in
chronic glomerulonephritis the anti-kidney auto￾antibody titre falls to ineffective levels after a time,
and that glomerular changes would have been ob￾served had the transplantations been carried out
in the acute phase of the disease.
The post-transplant antiric period
All four of the transplanted kidneys which ulti￾miiately showed measurable function developed
anuria. or marked oliguria, following transplan￾tation. and then "opened up" after 9 to 19 days.
This course resembles that seen Nith acute ische￾mic nephrosis following anoxic or toxic injury
in the normal human. Tw-o of the kidneys began
to function immediately after transplantation
(Cases No. 5 and No. 6), but stopped secreting
after a few hours. One re-opened 13 days later.
The other never functioned, probably due to local
factors. These two kidneys were both from liv￾ing donors with normal renal function-one a
child and one an adult. Both went through rela￾tively short periods of anoxia (55 and 14 min￾utes) .
It is likely, therefore, that the post-operative
anuric phase is due to the prolonged period of
ischemia which the transplants suffer. Most of
the donors were in profound shock for some pe￾riod of time prior to their demise, and this may
xwell have contributed to the ischemic nephrosis
371

D. M. HUME, J. P. MERRILL, B. F. MILLER, AND G. W. THORN
which was felt to be the basis of the anuria. This
exposure to anoxia was often continued after the
completion of the transplantation, because the re￾cipients were severely anemic and suffered from
various degrees of shock in the immediate post￾operative period. The thought occurred to us
that the initial anoxia might in some way delay
the destruction of the transplant by immune
mechanisms.
The anuric period is not an invariable part of
the course of the human renal transplant, however.
One of us (JPM) has had the opportunity of ob￾serving the result of a renal homograft performed
at the Necker Hospital in Paris. The surgical
management was undertaken by Drs. Oeconomos,
Vaysse, Michon, and Delinotte, and medical care
was under the supervision of Drs. Hamburger,
Richet, and Antoine. In this instance a sixteen￾year-old boy had a right nephrectomy for trau￾matic hematoma of the kidney, following which
absence of the left kidney was discovered. On the
eighth day of anuria a normal kidney was re￾moved from the patient's mother and transplanted
into the pelvis of the patient by anastomosis with
the iliac vessels. The period of anoxia was 53
minutes. A uretero-ureteral anastomosis allowed
the patient to void in normal fashion. The
mother's blood type was identical with that of the
patient. Urine was elaborated from the homo￾graft within two hours after the completion of
surgery, and a good urinary volume and function
was maintained for three weeks, thereafter, with
marked improvement in the clinical condition and
azotemia. However, quite suddenly, on the 23rd
post-operative day, function of the homograft
ceased. There had been no preceding hematuria,
infection, or mechanical obstruction. A biopsy at
this time showed numerous bloodless vessels and
glomeruli, with marked infiltration of the paren￾chyma by leucocytes, predominantly lymphocytes
and plasma cells. There was widespread degenera￾tion of tubular epithelium 18 (101).
Antibody production in nephritis
Patients with Bright's disease show hypopro￾teinemia and exhaustion of reserve protein (62).
This is partly due to decreased protein intake, and
partly to urinary protein loss, but apparently also
IsIWe are indebted to Dr. Hamburger for furnishing
us with details of this case.
to depressed formation of serum protein in nephri￾tis (13). In the nephrotic syndrome the hypo￾proteinemia is characterized by very low levels
of gamma globulin, in spite of the reversed A/G
ratio (85, 86, 125). There is some evidence that
under these circumstances antibody formation and
resistance to infection is decreased (16, 17, 42,
67, 87, 91), although this has been disputed by
others (6, 8, 100). The lack of agreement is de￾pendent partly on the variable degree of hypopro￾teinemia present in the animals or patients under
study, on the type of antigen used to elicit the im￾mune response, and on the means by which the
plasma proteins were lowered.
It is possible that a subnormal antibody produc￾tion may have contributed to the prolonged sur￾vival of the renal homografts seen in some of our
patients with chronic renal failure, although there
is no direct evidence to indicate that this is so.
The more rapid destruction of the homograft noted
by Michon and his associates (101) in their case
may have been related to the fact that the patient
was a healthy young boy in acute uremia, with
presumably normal immune mechanisms.
The effect of various hormzones
ACTH and cortisone were given in four cases,
and ACTH alone in two. We can come to no con￾clusion about the merit of corticoids or ACTH on
the basis of these few cases. No ACTH or cor￾tisone were used in Case No. 9, in which the trans￾plant functioned longer than in any of the others.
Persky and Jacobs (106) found that ACTH and
cortisone in experimental studies did not prolong
the survival of renal homotransplants in the dog.
Baker, Gordon, Huffer, and Miller (5) found that
treatment with nitrogen mustard plus cortisone,
with or without splenectomy, significantly pro￾longed renal homograft survival in the dog. They
point out that because all the animals lost weight
the results may be due to the poor nutritional
status of the treated animals. The effect of ACTH
on skin homografts has been debated, but most
investigators now feel that it does not significantly
prolong the graft take (7, 41). Cortisone has
been found by some workers to prolong skin
graft survival (9, 10, 15) and by others to have
no effect in this regard (41, 133, 134). Because
these substances may contribute to the spread of
372

RENAL HOMOTRANSPLANTATION IN THE HUMAN
infection, and because their contribution to the life
of the graft has not been spectacular, it is felt
that they do not offer any hope for the prolonga￾tion of human renal homografts.
Testosterone was used in all cases, because of
the reported finding that this substance helps to
maintain renal weight (64, 65), produces renal
hypertrophy (113), and protects against tubular
damage under some circumstances (53, 55, 113,
114), and for its anticatabolic effect.
Growth hormone was not tried, but studies with
this substance might be of interest.
Blood groups
It is generally accepted that blood groups are
of no importance in the destruction of skin homo￾grafts in the human (48, 96, 138) or tumor or
skin grafts in the fowl (49, 66). No studies have
been done on the effect of blood groups in renal
homotransplantation. Our own results in trans￾plants done in the presence of ABO incompati￾bility are not conclusive, as previously stated, be￾cause other variables were present in the two
cases reported here. We have been influenced by
these results, however, to the extent that we do
not feel that renal transplantation in the presence
of blood incompatibility is wise, if only on the
basis of possible local damage to the kidney.
Simonsen (121) has been able to demonstrate
incomplete immune agglutinins against the donor's
erythrocytes in cases of homotransplantation in
the dog. He points- out, however, that there is
no evidence that these antibodies are identical to
those destroying the transplants.
It is of interest that all of the patients with
functioning renal homotransplants received blood
transfusions at various intervals during their post￾operative course. No deleterious effect either to
the graft or the patient was noted as a consequence
of this.
Biological immunity
The acquired immunity theory of homograft re￾jection was hinted at in the work of Schone (110),
and clarified and strengthened by Medawar (92-
98). This concept holds that the homograft is
destroyed as a consequence of the development by
the host of specific antibodies against it. Evidence
for this is to be found in the following observa￾tions: 1) Second set homografts from the same
donor are destroyed more rapidly than the first
set (48, 77, 93); 2) Second set homografts from
another donor are also destroyed more rapidly
than the first set, but not so rapidly as secondary
transplants from the original donor, (95) sug￾gesting that there is some sharing of antigens
between individuals; 3) Direct contact between
isolated homologous cells in vivo does not lead to
their destruction (50), suggesting that homo￾graft rejection is a general rather than local phe￾nomenon; 4) Homografts can persist for long
periods in areas devoid of lymphatic drainage;
in these areas they can still be destroyed by
the placing in another site of a second graft
from the same donor (97, 102, 118, 124, 137).
Under these circumstances, therefore, the ini￾tial graft apparently does not elicit an antibody
response, but is still vulnerable to antibodies de￾veloped by the host against the second graft.
The chief objection to the theory of acquired
immunity at the present time is that it has never
been possible to detect circulating antibodies either
following the initial transplant, or on repeated
"immunization" of the animal.
Loeb has devised a theory, on the basis of his
work with implants, which states that lymphocytic
infiltration, brought about by "differentials," is
the direct cause of homograft disintegration. Im￾mune responses are held to be unessential (80-
82). We agree with Medawar, Dempster, and
Simonsen that Loeb's theory of differentials is
very confusing, and at times "impenetrably meta￾physical" ( 121 ).
Extensive reviews of these and other concepts
of the cause of biological incompatibility are avail￾able in the literature (31, 39, 80, 81, 94, 121).
The acquired immunity theory is outlined here so
that our results can be considered in the light of
their possible significance to immune mechanisms
of homograft destruction.
The enclosure of a renal transplant in a plastic bag.
In Case No. 9 the donor kidney was encased in
a plastic envelope at the time of transplantation.
This was done in an attempt to isolate it from
the local lymphatic drainage, in the hope that this
might decrease antibody formation against it.
There is a good deal of evidence to show that
373

D. M. HUME, J. P. MERRILL, B. F. MILLER, AND G. W. THORN
lymphatic tissue plays an important role in anti￾body production (12, 40, 96, 97, 102, 117, 118,
124, 137), and that regional lymphatics are con￾cerned with the development of antibodies against
locally injected antigens (37, 38, 90). Since the
plastic bag became torn at somiie time in the post￾operative period, we didn't succeed in isolating
the kidney permanently. It is possible, however,
that the bag may have played some role in delay￾ing the development of the immune reaction. Ex￾periments are under way in the experimental ani￾mal to study the effect on the survival of renal
homotransplants of their isolation, by various
means, from regional lymphatic drainage (59).
A comparison between retnal homografts in the
dog and in the human.
Recently Dempster (33, 34) and Simonsen
(120, 121) have reported on functional, patho￾logical, and immunological features of renal honio￾transplants in dogs. The results which they ob￾tained that permit a comparison with our cases are
summarized in Table XII.
A fever, associated with loss of appetite and
apathy has been described by Dempster in dogs
(34). Similar findings were usually noted with
homograft destruction in the human. When
present the fever was always associated with in￾fection. It was apparently of a milder nature
than that observed in dogs.
Homograft survival and function in the human
was much better than that seen in the dog. The
ability of the human kidney to recover from the
ischemic nephrosis seen in the immediate post￾operative period is evidence both for its adequate
viability and for its freedom from overwhelming
antibody attack during this period.
The human renal homografts were sometimes
densely adherent to the surrounding tissue. In
Case No. 4 a thick pseudocapsule had formed.
In general the degree of reaction surrounding the
transplant correlated with the amount of destruc￾tion, infarction, and infection present. In Case
No. 9 there were very few adhesions between the
transplant and the surrounding tissue, presum￾ably due to the presence of the bag, and the fact
that the kidney could move about in the wound.
In Case No. 8, too, very few adhesions were
present.
The microscopic picture seen in the human
renal transplants corresponds in most cases closely
to that described in the dog by Dempster (33).
It should be noted, however, that the reaction in
the human was much less intense and rapid.
Thus Dempster (30) described the microscopic
pathology of a dog's kidney 5 days after trans￾plantation as follows: "The kidney is enlarged
and its architecture grossly altered by edema,
hemorrhagic and non-hemorrhagic necrosis. Most
of the glomeruli and many tubules appear necrotic.
In addition to hemorrhage, the interstitial tissue
of the cortex and outer medulla is heavily infil￾trated with polymorphonuclear leukocytes, lym￾phocytes, histiocytes, and plasma cells. Most of
the cortical arteries and veins are dilated and are
involved in the necrotising process, and a number
are thrombosed. No organisms can be seen in a
Leishmann stain. The sinus renalis is massively
infiltrated with fibrin, red cells, polymorphonu￾clear leucocytes, and lymphocytes and histiocytes."
This can be compared with the picture seen in the
human after 37 days (Case No. 1). The glo￾meruli appeared relatively bloodless, but there was
no appreciable inflammation or increased cellu￾larity. The tubules showed a moderate amount of
degeneration, which was prominent in the proxi￾mal tubules and in the loops of Henle. Calcium
oxalate crystals were present in the lumen of the
tubules. There was also some regeneration of
tubular epithelium which was most noticeable in
the distal tubules (see Figure 5). There was very
little interstitial infiltration, and no appreciable
edema. There was no necrosis or hemorrhage
(see Figures 4 and 5). The histologic picture
resembled that seen in severe acute ischemic ne￾phrosis (103).
In Case No. 8, also, very little interstitial in￾filtration was present, and no appreciable edema.
The blood vessel changes were of interest. No
changes resembling periarteritis nodosa were
seen. This is in contrast to the findings reported
by Simonsen (121) in dog homotransplants.
These changes were not observed by Dempster
in dogs.
What was the cause of the tremendous athero￾sclerosis seen in the large and medium sized in￾trarenal vessels in Case No. 9? Both Dempster
and Simonsen describe endothelial swelling in the
intrarenal vessels in dog homotransplants.
Could this have been an extension of a process

a) As 3rd kidney: 1-5 days (av. 2.2 D).
b) One host kidney out: 1-8 D (av. 3.7 D).
c) Both host kidneys out: 1-10 D (av. 4.4 D).
3. Reactions with surrounding tissues: Capsule
did not adhere to host tissues, except in one
case. (Transplants done in neck.)
Simonsen and his associates (120, 121)
1. Toxic syndrome: High fever associated with
degeneration of kidney, confirming Dempster's
findings.
2. Survival of kidney: In most cases urine secre￾tion was not measured accurately. The bi￾laterally nephrectomized dogs lived 5-12 days,
av. 7.8 D. In 7 cases where turine secretion
could be estimated lasted 5-12 days, av. 7.8 D.
3. Reactions with surrounding tissues: Trans￾plant partly covered by adhesions of omentum.
(Transplants. done in abdomen.)
4. Period of anuria: Began secreting almost 4. Period of anuria: Began secreting few min￾immediately. Did not again secrete once it utes to one hour. Did not again secrete once

5. Function of homotransplant: Blood urea rises
steadily despite adequate volume from trans￾plant (up to 10 cc./min.) when host is bilater￾ally nephrectomized.
5. Function of homotransplant: Blood urea rose
steadily in all 10 cases with bilateral nephrec￾tomy. In one of these there was a slight one
day decrease on the 3rd day.
Human renal homotransplants reported here
1. Toxic syndrome: A fever was usually associ￾ated with the degeneration of the transplant.
Infection was often present, however. The
symptoms abated with the removal of the trans￾plant, as reported in dogs by Dempster (46).
In one instance marked hypothermia was pres￾ent (Case No. 8), probably due to uremia.
2. Survival of kidney: In the 4 functioning
transplants urinary secretion lasted for from
37 to 180 days, with an average of 97 days.
3. Reactions with surrounding tissues: In cases
with the greatest degree of destruction, ad￾hesions to the surrounding tissue were most
marked. In Case No. 4 a thick pseudocap￾sule had formed. Case No. 8 was an exception
(see Text).
4. Period of anuria: 8-1 to 19 days, except for
one case (Case No. 5) which secreted for 24
hours and then became anuric. The trans￾plants were able to recover from this period of
anuria.
5. Function of homotransplant: The blood urea
nitrogen came down in two cases with renal
homotransplants (Case No. 4 and No. 9).
The transplants could be demonstrated to be
functioning at about 25% of normal during
these periods.
Microscopic pathology
1. Primary transplants:
a) Interstitial: Cellular infiltration almost
entirely confined to cortex. Starts as im￾mature plasma cell infiltration around small
blood vessels. Later, cells are mature plasma
cells and are fotund everywhere, except meduilla. Polys found in terminal stages.
Edema not prominent.
b) Glomneruli: Relatively bloodless. No cel￾lular change either in endothelium or epi￾thelium of tufts. Basement membrane may
be somewhat thickened.
c) Tubules: In late stages tubular casts are
present, and droplet degeneration present in ttibtular cells.
d) Blood vessels: Renal artery normal, intra￾renal branches, large and small, show endo￾thelial swelling and pyronin-positive cells.
e) Ischemia causes renal changes.
1. Primary transplants:
a) Interstitial: Focal interstitial round cell
infiltration, more pronounced cortex than
medulla. Localized chiefly around glomeruli
and blood vessels. Cells are half lympho￾cytes and half pyronine-staining mononuclear
cells. Terminally, marked edema and infil￾tration and/or hemorrhage.
b) Glomeruli: Normal.
c) Tubules: In early stages (3-4 days) may
have casts, but often normal. Later many
casts, sometimes calcified. Tubules may be
dilated, or compressed and fragmented by
violent interstitial processes. Coagulation
necrosis of entire tubule may occur.
d) Blood vessels: 3-4 days: Intima and media
of larger vessels normal. Intertubular cap￾illaries show endothelial swelling. Terminal:
Intima of all sized vessels from capillaries
to large arteries shows swelling and pyro￾ninophilia of the endothelium. There is peri￾vascular infiltration and necrosis of the
adventitia, resembling periarteritis nodosa.
Arterioles and capillaries of glomeruli show
no necrosis.
e) Ischemia occurs as terminal event.
a) Interstitial: Focal interstitial round cell in￾filtration, more pronounced in the cortex than
medulla. No specific localization. No pyro￾nine stains done. Marked interstitial edema
occurred in some cases. Remarkably little
interstitial infiltration was seen in 2 cases at
the end of almost 40 days.
b) Glomeruli: Relatively bloodless. No cellu￾lar changes, except in Case No. 8 where severe
glomerulonephritis developed.
c) Tubules: Tubular changes in the later stages
appear to be the result of ischemic nephrosis.
Casts, and some degree of tubular degeneration
was always present.
d) Blood vessels: No changes resembling peri￾arteritis nodosa were seen. In Case No. 9
marked intimal thickening had occurred in the
larger intra-renal vessels, but not in the renal
artery. It was less marked or absent in the
smaller vessels. This was not seen in the other
cases. In the late stages of destruction of most
of the other cases thrombosis began in the
smaller intra-renal vessels, extending progres￾sively to the larger ones.
e) Ischemia may cause renal changes.
beginning, as Dempster suggests, because the
small renal blood vessels are antigenic, antibody
fixing, and antibody producing? Progressive
changes may have occurred in the blood vessel
walls in this case over several months, whereas
they might not have been seen in the other cases
because they didn't survive as long. Against this,
however, is the observation that early stages of
this lesion were not seen in any of the other cases,
and the kidney which survived for the next long￾est period of time (101 days) did not show any
such changes. Were these changes related in

some way to the fact that the patient had chronic
glomerulonephritis? This is unlikely, because no
glomerular changes of any significance occurred.
Could the atherosclerosis have been caused by
persistent severe hypertension applied to a kidney
from a host with chronic cardiac failure and hypo￾tension? This we must regard as the most likely
cause.
If the development of acquired immunity is the
underlying cause of homograft failure, what is
the immediate cause of the renal transplant de￾struction? Simonsen (121) believes that the
host's antibodies act in the interstitial tissue to
produce allergic vascular lesions resembling peri￾arteritis nodosa. This produces interstitial edema
and hemorrhage, interfering with the nutrition and
function of the tubules. Direct tubular damage by
the antibody cannot be ruled out. Dempster (33)
considers that the antibody acts on the small blood
vessels of the cortex to produce a generalized vas￾cular spasm, most marked in the tuft capillaries.
The swelling and differentiation of the endothelial
cells contributes to the slowing down of the renal
circulation. The decreased blood flow through
the tuft leads to decreased urinary excretion and
generalized tubular damage.
The histological picture seen in the human
homotransplant seems most in line with Demp￾ster's theory. The changes seen in the uninfected
transplant are those of severe ischemic nephrosis,
and are compatible with a markedly decreased
glomerular blood flow. Certainly in Case No. 9
the severe atherosclerosis must have contributed
to the decreased blood flow.
Summary of the observations made herein which
relate to immune mechanisms of homograft
destruction.
1) The rapid development of glomerulonephri￾tis in a kidney transplanted to a patient with peri￾arteritis, and the absence of this finding in trans￾plants done in patients with chronic glomerulo￾nephritis suggest that the titre of anti-glomerular
antibodies in this latter disease must be at in￾effective levels.
2) The absence of changes of periarteritis in
transplants done in patients not suffering from
this disease is in contrast with the reported pres￾ence of these changes in dog homotransplants
(1-21).
3) The question is raised whether the period
of anoxia suffered by the transplants prior to the
re-establishment of a blood supply, or the post￾transplantation ischemic nephrosis are able, in
any degree, temporarily to depress the anti￾genicity of the kidney, or the ability of the host
to form antibodies against it? No answer is
available to this question at the moment.
4) The question is also raised whether there
is a decreased ability of the patient with chronic
nephritis to form antibodies against homotrans￾plants, which permits a prolonged survival of
transplants in these patients?
5) There is evidence that skin shares antigens
with leukocytes, but not with erythrocytes (96).
No deleterious effect upon the transplant was
noted in those patients receiving multiple blood
transfusions, nor were there any transfusion reac￾tions. If antigens are shared between different
individuals, those which are present in the blood
do not seem to have any significance in homograft
rejection.
6) Cortisone and ACTH appeared to have no
effect on the survival of human renal homotrans￾plants. All of the long term survivals received
testosterone, but no conclusion can be reached as
to its possible effect.
7) In general, the histologic changes seen in
the transplanted human kidney are similar to those
reported by Dempster in the dog. The ability of
the human kidney to recover from a prolonged
period of post-transplantation anuria is unique,
however, as were the appearance of glomerulo￾nephritis in one case and arteriosclerosis in
another.
8) The immune response to a transplanted kid￾ney in the human is less intense than that in ex￾perimental animals reported in the literature, and
those in our own experience (59). We cannot
agree, on the basis of the foregoing study, with
Loeb, who states that the higher in the phylo￾genetic scale an animal is, the more highly de￾veloped is its ability to form antibodies; nor with
Dempster, who on accepting this dictum (33)
states that "sufficient experiments have been car￾ried out to make it quite clear that any attempt
at homotransplanting kidneys in humans, at this
stage, is doomed to failure and would be a dan￾gerous procedure" (30).

RENAL HOMOTRANSPLANTATION IN THE HUMAN
What is the status of human renal homotransplants
at the present time?
Simonsen (119-121) believes that the only real
hope of making homotransplantation of the kidney
a feasible procedure in cases of chronic uremia in
the human has to be based on the following con￾ditions: "First, that the most important indi￾vidual-specific antigens are shared by the kidney
and RBC, so that a gross biological incompatibility
can be eliminated by detailed blood group deter￾mination; secondly, that the kidney's defense re￾action against the recipient's antibodies and/or
antigens can check a less significant biological in￾compatibility without thereby destroying the kid￾ney, and thus provide a more or less complete
adaptation to the recipient."
From a practical point of view this offers little
hope. In the first place enough human homo￾transplantations of skin have been done to indi￾cate that there must be a large number of indi￾vidual specific antigens in the general population
not to have encountered compatible pairs by
random selection. In the second place we found
it extremely difficult to obtain kidneys from donors
with the same ABO and Rh groups as the in￾tended recipient. Several of our proposed re￾cipients died in the hospital while awaiting a
donor of the right blood type. Therefore, even if
one were able to identify a donor whose blood
(and renal) antigens were almost identical to
those of the recipient, it would be unlikely that the
donor kidney would become available at the right
time, or that it would be suitable from other points
of view (age, infection, cancer, etc.).
Renal homotransplantation has no place in the
therapy of human patients at this time. Our own
further studies in this field await the outcome of
problems now under investigation in the experi￾mental animal. We feel that it will prove valu￾able, as new data is accumulated in the laboratory,
however, to continue to investigate the problem
of human renal homotransplantation in the light
of these advances. Biological rejection in the hu￾man does not seem to be as violent, at least as re￾gards renal transplantation, as that found in the
experimental animal.
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS 19
1. Nine cases of homotransplantation of the
kidney in man are reported.
2. Five of the nine transplants did not develop
measurable function for various reasons.
3. Four of the nine transplants developed meas￾ureable function. The kidneys secreted urine for
from 37 to 180 days.
4. It is possible for transplants which have been
anoxic for 3 to 31/2 hours to develop function in
the host which is about 25 per cent of normal.
5. All of the transplanted kidneys went through
a period of anuria beginning either immediately
after transplantation or 24 hours later. The
anuria lasted from 8% to 19 days in the four cases
which ultimately showed measurable function.
This was felt to be due to the ischemic interval
incident to and following transplantation. The
ability of the kidney to recover from this anuria
has no parallel in animal experiments.
6. The general pathologic picture which accom￾panies homograft failure in the human is quali￾tatively similar to that seen in experimental ani￾mals, but appears much more slowly. Pathologi￾cal changes were observed in two human renal
homotransplants, however, that have not been
seen in animal experiments:
a) Severe acute glomerulonephritis developed
within 38 days in a homograft performed in a
patient with polyarteritis nodosa.
b) Marked atherosclerosis of intra-renal ves￾sels occurred within 183 days in a homotransplant
taken from a patient with mitral and aortic steno￾sis and placed in a patient with severe hyper￾tension.
7. Renal homograft rejection in the human is
much less violent and slower to develop than it is
in experimental animals.
8. The disease of the recipient appeared to be
able to modify adversely-in the case of poly￾19 Since this paper was written another article has
appeared (Murray, G., and Holden, R., Am. J. Surg.,
1954, 87, 508.) dealing with renal homotransplantation
in the human. Transplants were performed in four
cases, with death of the patient in three. In the fourth
case the transplanted kidney is thought to be viable and
effective after fifteen months. No function studies or
biopsies are available, however, to indicate conclusively
that the kidney is alive and functioning.

arteritis nodosa-the course of the transplanted
kidney. The question is raised as to whether there
is a depressed antibody formation in chronic re￾nal disease which can favorably influence trans￾plant survival by diminishing the host reaction
against the transplant.
9. Although auto-antibodies against renal tis￾sue are said to be present in the blood of patients
with chronic glomertulonephritis, they did not
lead to the development of glomerulonephritis in
kidneys homografted to lpatients with this disease.
10. An attempt to reduce the immune response
against a renal homograft is described.
11. ACTH and cortisone did not appear to
exert any pronounced beneficial effect on the sur￾vival of human renal transplants.
12. At the present state of our knowledge, renal
homotransplalnts do not appear to be jutstified in
the treatment of humiian disease.
13. It is our conviction that this experience
serves to indicate certaini imiiportant species differ￾ences in renal homiiograft response, and that as
cellular and animal experimentation progresses,
constant cross-check with clinical experience is
vitally essential to progress in this field of wvork.
