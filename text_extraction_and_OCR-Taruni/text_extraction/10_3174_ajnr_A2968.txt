REVIEW ARTICLE
Multimodality MR Imaging Findings of Low-Grade Brain Edema
in Hepatic Encephalopathy
L.J. Zhang, J. Zhong, and G.M. Lu
ABSTRACT
SUMMARY: HE is a neuropsychiatric syndrome that develops in patients with severe liver diseases, with portosystemic shunt surgery in
the form of diffuse mild brain edema. It is also associated with functional changes, such as those in attention and the DMN. MR imaging
offers a range of capabilities for assessing the low-grade brain edema and its functional changes in brain affected by HE; therefore, it
provides the opportunity to uncover the pathophysiologic mechanisms of HE. This article will review our current understanding of the
pathophysiology of low-grade brain edema and will outline the role of structural MR imaging, MTR, DWI, DTI, and MR spectroscopy in the
detection of low-grade brain edema, and the role of BOLD fMRI in the exploration of the related functional changes. A perspective of the
study in this area will also be provided.

HE is a neuropsychiatric syndrome that develops in patients
with severe liver diseases and/or portosystemic shunt surgery
resulting from a serious complication of acute and chronic liver
failure. HE is characterized by a wide spectrum of clinical mani￾festations, ranging from alterations of psychometric performance
to stupor and coma.1 HE is regarded as the result of overt brain
edema and increased intracranial pressure in acute liver failure.
However, patients with cirrhosis and HE usually show no clinical
signs of brain edema and increased intracranial pressure, instead
in vivo and in vitro studies from humans and animals have dem￾onstrated the existence of a low-grade brain edema.2-10 This re￾view will focus first on the roles of low-grade brain edema in HE
and its qualitative and quantitative diagnosis with advanced mul￾timodal MR imaging techniques. We will then review the results
of functional changes that are attributed to brain edema in pa￾tients with cirrhosis and HE by using BOLD fMRI.
CLINICAL FEATURES OF HE
The Working Party at the 11th World Congresses of Gastroenter￾ology held in Vienna in 1998 recommended the nomenclature
and types of HE: HE type A, encephalopathy associated with acute
liver failure; HE type B, encephalopathy associated with portosys￾temic bypass and no intrinsic hepatocellular disease; and HE type
C, encephalopathy associated with cirrhosis and portal cirrhosis
and portal hypertension or portosystemic shunts.11HE type C can
be classified into 3 main groups on the basis of the duration and
characteristics of the clinical manifestations: episodic, chronic,
and minimal. Episodic HE is characterized by the development of
a confusional syndrome, including impaired mental state, neuro￾muscular abnormalities, asterixis, fetor hepaticus, and hyperven￾tilation, which develops during a short period and fluctuates in
severity. Chronic HE can be further classified into subgroups:
relapsing HE and persistent HE. Relapsing HE manifests as fre￾quent episodes of acute HE, while persistent HE refers to mani￾festations that do not reverse despite adequate treatment. The
most characteristic manifestations of severe persistent HE are de￾mentia, parkinsonism, or myelopathy in combination with other
manifestations of neurologic involvement (ataxia, gait abnormal￾ities, tremor).1
Recently, MHE becomes the focus of study in the HE field
because it causes impairment of driving and daily living

and occurs in 20%–80% of patients with cirrhosis (especially
in patients with advanced liver disease, Child-Pugh B/C).3 MHE
refers to the population of patients with cirrhosis or porto￾systemic shunts who have subtly abnormal cognitive and/or neu￾rophysiologic functions but no significant clinical signs and
symptoms of HE. MHE was also diagnosed in those patients with
extrahepatic portal venous obstruction.12 The neuropsychologi￾cal features of MHE point to a disorder of executive functioning,
particularly selective attention and psychomotor speed; but other
abnormalities, such as working memory, are also seen.13,14 A
complete psychometric assessment by a neuropsychologist is the
best way to know the extent of the patient’s cognitive impairment.
A standardized test battery, including the NCT-A and NCT-B,
line-tracing, serial-dotting, and digit-symbol tests (portosystemic
encephalopathy syndrome test), has a high specificity for HE
compared with other metabolic encephalopathies.11 Some
authors believe that critical flicker frequency is a simple, reliable,
and accurate test without any age or literacy dependence for the
diagnosis of MHE and could predict the development of overt
HE.15 However, changes in electroencephalogram/evoked re￾sponses and neuroimaging findings are nonspecific and may not
be able to provide sufficient information for the diagnosis of min￾imal HE.
LOW-GRADE BRAIN EDEMA AND HE
Clinically manifest brain edema is a well-known complication of
acute or fulminant hepatic failure; however, patients with cirrho￾sis and HE usually show no clinical signs of overt brain edema. In
the 1990s, in vivo 1
H-MR spectroscopy studies provided the first
evidence for the presence of low-grade brain edema in these pa￾tients with cirrhosis and HE in the form of depletion of the mIns
peak and elevation of the Glx signal intensity.16 Since then, many
studies have shown the presence of low-grade brain edema as a
result of astrocyte swelling and the role of ammonia and HE pre￾cipitating factors, such as neuroinflammation processes in the
pathogenesis of HE.9,17
Various hypotheses have been proposed to explain the com￾plex neuropsychiatric syndrome seen in HE. Hyperammonemia
is the most important and widely accepted hypothesis for
HE.1,5,6,8 The hyperammonemia leads to profound astrocyte
changes, including Alzheimer type II changes in chronic HE and
astrocyte swelling in acute HE. There is convincing evidence from
animal and imaging studies for the role of brain edema as a major
contributor to the development of HE.3-7 Brain edema is partly
due to uptake of ammonia into astrocytes causing cellular swell￾ing as 1 common pathogenetic end point. In addition, oxidative
stress, endogenous benzodiazepine-like ligands, inflammatory
cytokines, and potential manganese toxicity can all have a role in
the pathogenesis of HE. However, no single factor can fully ex￾plain this pathogenesis. More recent evidence suggests that there
is a synergistic effect between ammonia and various other inflam￾matory cytokines that results in excess glutamine within astro￾cytes, leading to osmotic swelling of the astrocytes and the subse￾quent brain edema as well as other neurocytotoxic effects.8-10
Hau¨ssinger and Schliess18 proposed a model of the pathogenesis
of HE. In this model, ammonia and other neurotoxins synergis￾tically induce a low-grade cerebral edema as a result of astrocyte
swelling, which is sufficient to trigger multiple alterations of as￾trocyte function and gene expression. As a result of an altered
astrocyte function, glial neuronal communication and multiple
neurotransmitter systems become deranged and impact synaptic
plasticity and cerebral networks, which finally may account for
the symptoms of HE (Fig 1).18
QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE MR IMAGING OF
BRAIN EDEMA IN HE
Brain Edema in Acute HE
Patients with acute HE may exhibit characteristic regions of in￾volvement on T2-weighted and FLAIR sequences.19-21 These pa￾tients having diffuse cortical involvement from imaging findings
are more likely to have a poor outcome, though even such diffuse
insults may ultimately reverse.20,21 U-King-Im et al21 reported a
specific pattern of imaging findings, with extensive cortical injury,
including bilateral symmetric involvement of the insular and cin￾gulate cortices. Additional involvement of parietal, frontal, tem￾poral, or occipital cortices was seen but was much more variable
in extent and also asymmetric. In acute HE, diffuse cortical re￾stricted diffusion resulting from cytotoxic edema can be detected,
with the appearance of a decreased ADC value on the ADC map
and high signal intensity on DWI in diffuse regions of the cerebral
cortex.19-21 The MR imaging extent on FLAIR and DWI strongly
correlate with the severity and duration of the hyperammonemia
and predisposing susceptibility to the metabolic insult. McKinney
et al22 believed that acute HE occurs along a spectrum, with mul￾tifocal diffuse cortical findings being at the severe end.
Brain Edema in Chronic HE
Structural MR Imaging. In chronic HE (type C), low-grade brain
edema has been reported in many human and animal studies by
using other advanced MR images,2-7 but no mild abnormalities
can be detected in conventional T1- and T2-weighted images,
except basal ganglia hyperintensity,1which is attributed to hyper￾magnesemia (Fig 2A, -B). Some investigators also reported high
signal intensity along the hemispheric white matter in or around
the corticospinal tract on fast FLAIR T2-weighted images (Fig
2C), strikingly similar to signal intensity abnormalities noted in
cases of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, a neurodegenerative disease
that affects motor neurons. The progressive normalization of the
high signal intensity abnormalities on the FLAIR sequence in pa￾tients with cirrhosis can be found after successful liver transplan￾tation or effective treatments, which is different from cerebral
infarct.1 Observation of white matter high intensity in FLAIR im￾ages alone without confirmation with additional imaging se￾quences cannot be used to interpret these changes in patients with
HE.
MTI. MTI is a useful technique to detect low-grade brain edema
in HE.1,4,23 It is mainly based on the interaction (cross-relaxation)
between protons in a relatively free environment (bulk water) and
those in which motion is restricted (immobile water). MTI can
allow the measurement of MTRs, which can reflect brain paren￾chymal changes that may not be visible by using standard MR
imaging techniques.6 All studies by using MTI in HE found re￾duced MTR values in all the examined regions of the brain in HE
708 Zhang Apr 2013 www.ajnr.org

compared with the controls (Fig 3). Lower MTR may result from
pathologies that alter the structural integrity and the relative mac￾romolecular-water composition of brain parenchyma, such as in
multiple sclerosis plaques or in end-stage cirrhosis. Compared
with other diseases, such as experimental autoimmune encepha￾lomyelitis, toxic demyelination, progressive multifocal leukoen￾cephalopathy, human immunodeficiency virus encephalitis, and
multiple sclerosis, the MTR decrease in chronic HE is mild (ap￾proximately 10%) and is not accompanied by significant abnor￾malities on conventional T1- and T2-weighted images.23 This
MTR decrease almost returns to normal values after liver trans￾plantation.1 Thus, the phenomenon observed on MTI may sup￾port the hypothesis that mild brain edema is present in patients
with cirrhosis.24
DWI. DWI is a method for quantifying the movement of water
molecules. Water molecules follow the principles of Brownian
motion. In a container of water, molecules undergo free thermally
FIG 1. Low-grade brain edema in HE. Ammonia induces astrocyte swelling, which is, in part, counteracted by osmolyte depletion but can be
aggravated by a set of precipitating factors. Astrocyte swelling involves activation of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor and the generation of
reactive nitrogen oxide species, which again cause astrocyte swelling. The autoamplificatory loop produces signals that change the astrocyte
function at multiple levels, including covalent modifications of proteins and ribonucleic acid, resulting in impaired glioneuronal communication,
synaptic plasticity, and brain networks, which finally account for the symptoms of HE. Adapted with permission from Haussinger et al,18 with

agitated diffusion, which is also called isotropic (meaning equal in
all directions). However, limited (anisotropic) diffusion is ob￾served in the brain because the movement of water molecules is
restricted by their interactions with cell membranes and macro￾molecules. DWI derives its image contrast on the basis of differ￾ences in the mobility of protons (primarily associated with water)
between tissues. Using DWI, one can calculate a diffusivity value
to quantitatively assess the strength of water molecule movement
in tissue.
DTI. DTI can be used to obtain anisotropy information of water
molecule diffusion in tissues by applying specific
diffusion-weighted field gradients in at least 6 directions. The
most commonly used indices for the measurement of anisotropic
diffusions by DTI include the relative anisotropy, FA, and the vol￾ume ratio indices. These indices provide quantitative
measurements of the changes of white matter integ￾rity in different brain regions that are affected by diseases. Using
DTI techniques together with advanced fiber tracking algorithms,
which are mathematic approaches to derive white matter tractog￾raphy from DTI data, one can construct 3D trajectories of neural
tracts noninvasively, allowing the modeling of white matter neu￾ral connectivity.
Recently, DWI and DTI have been used to detect brain abnor￾malities in patients with HE (Fig 4).20,25,26 In this set￾ting, ADC/mean diffusivity was a reliable tool for quantification
of low-grade HE and could predict the development of overt
HE.26 The mean diffusivity values were increased in patients with
cirrhosis with MHE compared with patients with no HE or con￾trols. Patients with MHE could be separated from patients with no
HE with a sensitivity of 70%–90% and a specificity of 85%–90%
by using DWI. In addition, diffusivity values of white matter, such
as the frontal and parietal white matter, were found to be predic￾tive of further bouts of overt HE.25
DWI and DTI have the potential to define the nature of low￾grade brain edema in patients with cirrhosis. However, recent
studies on low-grade brain edema with DWI/DTI techniques have

quantification of MTR are seen in these images.

not reached consistent results to support which DWI/DTI index
has a predominant role in the pathophysiology of HE, partly be￾cause of different types of HE models, subjects, and techniques
used in different studies.7,27-30 Some studies on the use of mean
diffusivity measurements in DTI within normal-appearing white
matter of patients with cirrhosis have shown a significant increase
in brain water diffusivity, which was more pronounced with the
increasing grade of HE.23,27 These diffusivity values correlated
with neuropsychological impairment and serum venous ammo￾nia. These findings probably reflect an accumulation of water in
the extracellular compartment and, therefore, do not support the
hypothesis of astrocytic swelling as the cause of diffuse brain
edema in chronic liver failure.1 In the study of Kale et al,27 signif￾icantly increased mean diffusivity was found with insignificant
changes in FA in various regions of brain in patients with MHE or
type C HE compared with controls, indicating an increase in in￾terstitial water in the brain parenchyma without any microstruc￾tural changes. The study of Nath et al28 found that the presence of
significantly decreased FA and linear anisotropy and increased
spheric isotropy along with no significant change in mean diffu￾sivity and planar anisotropy suggests the presence of both intra￾cellular and extracellular components of cerebral edema in pa￾tients with acute-on-chronic liver failure. Decreased mean
diffusivity values in patients with fulminant hepatic failure sug￾gest that predominant cytotoxic edema may be present.29
The study of Chavarria et al7
in a rat model of acute liver failure
supported the cytotoxic origin of brain edema, suggesting that the
metabolism of ammonia in astrocytes induces an increase of glu￾tamine and lactate, which appears to mediate cellular swelling. Rai
et al30 reported that decreased mean diffusivity and increased
spheric isotropy in patients with acute hepatic failure associated
with decreased FA represent cytotoxic and interstitial compo￾nents of brain edema, respectively. Thus, it appears that 2 types of
brain edema may simultaneously exist in liver failure, predomi￾nantly intracellular in acute forms, interstitial in chronic forms,
and both in acute-on-chronic liver failure.
MR Spectroscopy. MR spectroscopy is a noninvasive analytic
method often paired with MR imaging in neuroradiology prac￾tices. It is capable of identifying and measuring the individual
chemicals in the brain regions localized and sampled from MR
images, offering the potential to interrogate the molecular process
within tissues and fluids in vivo and in vitro. Two nuclei (ie, 1
H
and 36P) can be used for clinical MR spectroscopy studies.5,6
1
H-MR spectroscopy is widely used in clinical practice to provide
information on brain metabolites such as Cho, Cr, NAA, glu￾tamine, and Glx, as well as osmolytes, such as mIns and taurine. 1
H-MR spectroscopy is widely used in HE studies and has
consensus findings on the intracellular metabolite changes in HE,
while 31P MR spectroscopy studies are relatively rare and no con￾sensus results are available.5,6 Typical 1
H-MR spectroscopy find￾ings of HE are lower Cho/Cr and mIns/Cr and higher Glx/Cr,5,6,31
which are seen in all examined brain regions of patients compared
with controls (Fig 5). Hyperammonia can account for the MR
spectroscopy findings in patients with cirrhosis. One recent
study32 of induced hyperammonemia in patients with cirrhosis
showed that ammonia could directly drive changes in brain water
distribution as a mechanism for cerebral edema development. In

the theory of hyperammonemia accounting for the pathogenetic
mechanism of HE, the increase in brain glutamine (increased
Glx/Cr on 1
H-MR spectroscopy) due to hyperammonemia dur￾ing HE increases intracellular osmolality. To maintain osmotic
equilibrium, the astrocytes lose osmolytes such as mIns and Cho
(decreased mIns/Cr and Cho/Cr on 1
H-MR spectroscopy) and a
large amount of water enters the astrocyte and results in cellular
swelling and impairment of cellular metabolism, further in￾fluencing neuronal and astrocyte function and interaction be￾tween them.1,5,6
Patients without cirrhosis may tolerate such precipitating fac￾tors without developing HE symptoms because their osmolyte
systems for counteraction of cell swelling are not exhausted. How￾ever, organic osmolytes are largely depleted in patients with cir￾rhosis to compensate for glial glutamine accumulation, and there
may be little room for action of these volume-regulatory mecha￾nisms against further challenges of cell volume. This labile situa￾tion may explain not only the rapid kinetics of HE episodes but
also the occasional appearance of clinically overt cerebral edema
in end-stage cirrhosis.18 With 1
H-MR spectroscopy, no signifi￾cant changes of NAA were detected in patients with cirrhosis
compared with healthy subjects, which indicates the integrity of
neurons.31
However, this finding appears to be contradictory to the evi￾dence of brain atrophy from voxel-based morphometry.33 It is
possible that mild-to-moderate loss of myelin and axons is not
always found in chronic HE.2 Of these 1
H-MR spectroscopy
parameters, mIns seems to be a more sensitive bio￾marker than Cho to detect HE.18,31,34 mIns levels were related to
the Child-Pugh score and severity of HE.31,34 However, cutoff
values have not been established, and the diagnostic accuracy of
1
H-MR spectroscopy remains uncertain. 1
H-MR spectroscopy is
unable to differentiate some metabolites, such as Glx and taurine.
2D 1
H-MR spectroscopy has enhanced spectral resolution to
show more metabolites, which can be helpful in understanding
the pathogenesis of HE. Wide availability of 3T MR imaging scan￾ners can improve the ability of 1
H-MR spectroscopy to differen￾tiate Glx. 1
H-MR spectroscopy findings also supported the role of mul￾tiple precipitating factors, such as hyperammonia and proinflam￾matory cytokines in the pathogenesis of HE. Gupta et al10 found
that proinflammatory cytokines showed positive correlation with
spheric anisotropy and negative correlation with mean diffusivity
in various brain regions, including the spectroscopy voxel in pa￾tients with acute liver failure. These correlations suggest that both
DTI-derived metrics and 1
H-MR spectroscopy measure the syn￾ergistic effect of hyperammonemia and proinflammatory cyto￾kines and may be used as noninvasive tools for understanding the
pathogenesis of brain edema in acute liver failure. 1
H-MR spectroscopy is also a useful tool to monitor the met￾abolic changes after treatment or interventions for HE. 1
H-MR
spectroscopy abnormalities are reversible after successful liver
transplantation and effective treatment,35 indicating the nature of
reversible brain edema in patients with cirrhosis.1,20,21 The evo￾lution of the metabolic changes differs for each metabolite after
liver transplantation. The Cho peak normalizes earlier than the
other peaks, and the glutamine/Glx peak reaches the normal
range at 1–2 months. The peak mIns abnormalities may take 3–7
months to reach normal values. This reversibility of 1
H-MR spec￾troscopy abnormalities precedes the disappearance of pallidal hy￾perintensity after liver transplantation and correlates with im￾provements in the neurologic manifestations of HE.32,35
However, 1
H-MR spectroscopy abnormalities can also be de￾tected in patients with abnormal liver function after liver
transplantation.
BOLD fMRI. Although no clinically overt brain edema and intra￾cranial pressure can be detected with conventional T1- and T2-
weighted imaging, small increases in astrocyte water content,
present in cirrhosis with MHE or overt HE, may have important
functional consequences through triggering of a set of molecular
events.18 Disturbance of oscillatory networks detected in patients
with low-grade HE at magnetoencephalography supports the
speculation that glioneuronal communication resulting from the
low-grade brain edema is impaired in these patients.36 Many be￾havioral studies have claimed the existence of neuropsychological
abnormalities, such as attention and fine-motor alterations, in
patients with cirrhosis without overt HE.13,14 Thus, it is rational
and feasible to investigate brain function changes in patients with
cirrhosis.
Recently, some investigators demonstrated an abnormal brain
network in patients with cirrhosis by using BOLD fMRI, even to
predict the development of overt HE. fMRI detects BOLD changes
in MR imaging signal intensity that arise when changes in neuro￾nal activity occur following a change in brain state—for example,
responding to a stimulus or performing a specific task. The BOLD
MR imaging signal-intensity change is the result of combined
changes of hemoglobin oxygenation and cerebral blood flow dur￾ing brain activation. With 3D imaging and high spatial resolution
capabilities, fMRI has been developed as a primary functional
brain-mapping tool, offering a wide range of applications in both
clinical (such as neurosurgery preoperative planning) and basic
neurosciences.37
fMRI can be classified as either task-related or resting-state
fMRI, according to experimental paradigms. In a task-related
fMRI design, a subject is placed in the magnet and scanned while
various different kinds of stimulus are administered in a con￾trolled fashion. Two main experimental paradigms are in com￾mon use in task-related fMRI studies: block design and event￾related paradigms.37 In resting-state fMRI, the participants are
required to rest with their eyes closed and keep their heads still
and not to think of anything in particular during MR imaging
scans lasting typically a few minutes.
Despite increasing use of fMRI in the past decade, fMRI stud￾ies in patients with cirrhosis are few, even though it has become
increasingly attractive in recent years. A few task-related fMRI
studies have focused on the attention-function impairment in
patients with cirrhosis with different task stimuli. For example,
Zafiris et al38 first analyzed the pathologically impaired neural
mechanisms of patients with cirrhosis by using fMRI. They found
decreased judgment-related BOLD activation in the right IPL,
impaired neural interaction between the IPL and the parieto-oc￾cipital cortex, the intraparietal sulcus, the anterior cingulate cor￾tex, the right prefrontal cortex, the medial temporal lobe, and the
extrastriate cortex V5 and an enhanced coupling between the IPL
712 Zhang Apr 2013 www.ajnr.org

and the postcentral cortex in patients with MHE compared with
controls. This study demonstrated an early impaired and com￾pensatory neural mechanism during visual judgment already in
the earliest stages of HE. Zhang et al14 used a Chinese character
Stroop task as the target stimulus to investigate the neural mech￾anism of cognitive control impairment in patients with cirrhosis
by using the fMRI method, providing further evidence in support
of the fact that patients with cirrhosis have impaired cognitive
control function and that the abnormal anterior cingulate cortex–
prefrontal cortex–parietal ‘‘fusiform” cortex circuit could be the
neural mechanism responsible for this impaired cognitive control
(Fig 6). However, paradigms should be kept simple to isolate spe￾cific brain areas in the task-induced fMRI. Thus, the technique is
only suitable for patients who can perform tasks and therefore is
better suited to low-grade or minimal HE.7 To the best of our
knowledge, no more task-related fMRI studies on HE have been
published to date.
Recently, increasing attention has been focused on detecting
brain activities in the resting state. Currently, the spatial topogra￾phies of brain functional connectivity at the resting state are
widely known as resting-state networks. Resting-state networks
normally represent a remarkably robust phenomenon, which is
present in rudimentary form early in human life and later reorga￾nized as brain development proceeds through childhood. These
networks persist during task performance and sleep and under
sedation.39 Most reported resting-state networks include the
DMN, the sensorimotor component, the executive control com￾ponent, up to 3 visual components, 2 lateralized frontoparietal
components, the auditory component, and the temporoparietal
component.40 As already reported, these resting-state networks
consist of anatomically separated but functionally connected re￾gions displaying a high level of correlated BOLD signal-intensity
activity. Currently, the most studied network is the DMN, includ￾ing the medial prefrontal cortex, rostral anterior cingulate, PCC,
and precuneus. What the DMN represents is unclear, but it is
known to have high metabolic activity during rest and is sup￾pressed during cognitively demanding tasks, such as visual and
auditory attention, language processing, memory, and motor ac￾FIG 6. fMRI studies of cognitive control in healthy patients and those with cirrhosis. A and B,

tivity. An abnormal default function network has been known to
relate to Alzheimer disease, autism, attention deficit/hyperactivity
disorder, schizophrenia, epilepsy, and other diseases. In a study by
Zhang et al,41 the DMN of patients with cirrhosis was investigated
with the subtraction method by using a blocked-design fMRI in
which a block design was used with a modified Chinese Stroop
task as the target stimulus. In that study, the subtraction method
was used to study the resting-state network in patients with he￾patic cirrhosis; the functional and behavioral data suggest that
patients with cirrhosis may have an abnormal deactivation mode.
The absence of deactivation in the PCC and precuneus may be a
sensitive rather than specific marker in patients with hepatic
cirrhosis.
Recently, in a standard resting-state fMRI study including 10
patients with HE and 14 controls, Zhang et al42 found signifi￾cantly reduced functional connectivity in the right middle frontal
gyrus, left precuneus, and left PCC in the patients with HE (Fig
7A–C). Z scores of the left angular gyrus and left PCC were found
to have negative correlation with venous blood ammonia levels,
an important biomarker for HE, in the HE group (Fig 7D). Our
recent study further demonstrated that patients with HE had dif￾fuse abnormalities in intrinsic brain activity with ALFF, based on
whole-brain functional analysis algorithms. The level of de￾creased ALFF in the DMN and increased ALFF in the posterior
insular cortex depends on HE severity, suggesting continuous im￾pairment of the DMN and a compensatory role of the insula dur￾ing the progression of HE (Qi RF, November 12, 2011, unpub￾lished data). Thus, it appears that resting-state fMRI with ALFF
analysis may be an effective and noninvasive technique to predict
the development of HE. To the best of our knowledge, no fMRI
studies on other resting-state networks in patients with HE have
been published at the time of this writing. However, it is possible
that the diffusely abnormal resting-state brain networks are pres￾ent in patients with MHE and chronic HE on the basis of the
above-mentioned fMRI studies.41,42
PERSPECTIVE
In recent years, the understanding of the pathophysiology of HE
has been improved with advanced MR imaging techniques, espe￾cially of the role of low-grade brain edema in the pathophysiology
of HE; however, many issues remain unresolved. We need to de￾fine the nature of low-grade brain edema in different types of HE,
such as chronic, acute, and acute-on-chronic. Perfusion-weighted
MR imaging, such as arterial spin-labeling, a noninvasive MR
imaging technique in which the blood is used as an endogenous
contrast agent, can be used to investigate the hemodynamic
changes of HE and to differentiate patients with cirrhosis from
patients with MHE. BOLD-based fMRI should also be further
investigated; the role of BOLD fMRI in the neural basis of cogni￾tive and functional impairment of patients with HE and of the
progression of HE from cirrhosis to minimal HE to overt HE
should be clarified. The molecular imaging technique, combined
MR imaging/PET, may have a promising role in uncovering the
pathogenesis of HE, especially the role of molecular markers
(such as peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors) in HE. A
large-cohort well-designed clinical trial should be performed in
the future to demonstrate the role of multimodality MR imaging
techniques in the early detection and follow-up of HE.
CONCLUSIONS
HE appears as diffuse mild brain edema and is associated with
functional changes, such as those in attention and default mode
brain areas, which have been demonstrated by a variety of MR
imaging techniques. MR imaging offers a range of capabilities for
investigating HE and is helpful in clarifying the pathophysiologic
mechanism of HE. It will play an increasingly important role in
early diagnosis of HE with more MR imaging studies performed
in this field. The recent development of fMRI and DTI provides
and expands the applications of the MR imaging study of HE with
the capability of assessing functional changes in brain affected by
HE, therefore, providing the opportunity to uncover the patho￾physiologic mechanisms of HE.
FIG 7. DMN changes in patients with HE. A, DMN of the controls consists of bilateral precu￾neus/posterior cingulate cortex, medial prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, angular
gyri, and temporal pole (P  .05, FDR-corrected). B, DMN of the patients with HE consists of the
bilateral precuneus/posterior cingulate cortex, medial prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate
cortex, angular gyri, and temporal pole (P  .05, FDR-corrected). Patterns in the patients with HE
are similar but with reduced size compared with those of healthy subjects in. C, Differences
between the DMN of the patients with HE and controls were in the left posterior cingulate
cortex and bilateral precuneus, right angular gyrus, bilateral middle frontal cortex, and left
parahippocampus (P  .05 for all, uncorrected) and in the right middle frontal gyrus and left
posterior cingulate cortex (P  .05 corrected, combined height threshold P  .01 and a mini￾mum cluster size of 24 voxels). D, Statistical t maps of the vein blood ammonia against z scores
in ICA in the HE group. A negative correlation of the ICA z score with venous blood ammonia
was found in the right middle frontal gyrus, left posterior cingulate cortex, left parahippocampus, bilateral angular gyri (P  .05 for all,
uncorrected), and the left angular gyrus color-coded bright blue (P  .05 corrected, combined height threshold P  .01 and a minimum cluster
size of 24 voxels).
