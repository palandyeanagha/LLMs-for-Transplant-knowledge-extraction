Abstract
Background: The objective of this study is to determine in a case series (four patients) how calcified deposits in
renal papillae are associated with the development of calcium oxalate monohydrate (COM) papillary calculi.
Methods: From the recently collected papillary calculi, we evaluated retrospectively patients, subjected to
retrograde ureteroscopy, with COM papillary lithiasis.
Results: The COM papillary calculi were found to result from subepithelial injury. Many of these lesions underwent
calcification by hydroxyapatite (HAP), with calculus morphology and the amount of HAP in the concave zone
dependent on the location of the calcified injury. Most of these HAP deposits grew, eroding the epithelium
covering the renal papillae, coming into contact with urine and starting the development of COM calculi.
Subepithelial HAP plaques may alter the epithelium covering the papillae, resulting in the deposit of COM crystals
directly onto the epithelium. Tissue calcification depends on a pre-existing injury, the continuation of this process is
due to modulators and/or crystallization inhibitors deficiency.
Conclusions: Since calculus morphology and the amount of detected HAP are dependent on the location and
widespread of calcified injury, all types of papillary COM calculi can be found in the same patient. All patients had
subepithelial calcifications, with fewer papillary calculi, demonstrating that some subepithelial calcifications did not
further evolve and were reabsorbed. A high number of subepithelial calcifications increases the likelihood that
some will be transformed into COM papillary calculi.

Background
Soft tissue calcifications are a result of preexisting injury,
tissue alteration and/or necrosis. The cellular detritus of
the damaged extracellular matrix generated during these
processes can induce calcium phosphate (hydroxyapatite
[HAP]) formation through heterogeneous nucleation pro￾cesses in practically all tissues because plasma and inter￾cellular liquid are supersaturated with HAP [1]. The
presence of crystallization inhibitors (non-signaling small
molecules that bind to crystal nuclei or crystal faces and
inhibit crystal development) can prevent or delay the for￾mation of HAP crystals. Molecules reported to inhibit
crystallization associated with soft tissue calcification
include metabolic substances such as pyrophosphate [2,3],
synthetic molecules including bisphosphonates [4-6], and
natural products including myo-inositol hexakisphosphate
(phytate) [7,8]. Cellular factors, including proteins that
regulate bone mineralization, have also been implicated in
the process of soft tissue calcification. The activity of such
proteins can either enhance or inhibit the ability of
immune system macrophages to remove HAP deposits
(i.e. osteoclastic activity) [9-11]. Thus, for example,
osteopontin has been shown to regulate the activity of
macrophages and macrophage-derived cells (osteoclasts),
facilitating phagocytosis and enhancing destruction of
HAP deposits [10,11]. The combined and simultaneous
action of crystallization inhibitors and the immune system * Correspondence: fgrases@uib.es

can inhibit further progression and even induce the total
reversion of the calcification process [9,12-14].
Papillary renal calculi are small size uroliths, mainly
composed of calcium oxalate monohydrate (COM).
They exhibit a typical morphology consisting of a con￾cave face (zone of union with the papillary tissue) and
an opposite smooth convex face. According to recent
studies, around 13% of all renal calculi are of renal papil￾lary type [15]. A COM papillary stone can only develop
from a nidus comprised of several crystals and/or
organic matter that attach to the kidney papilla. Urine
remains supersaturated with calcium oxalate [16,17].
HAP has been identified as the major component of the
nidus (core). In the 1930’s, Randall described a pre￾calculus lesion in the renal papilla and proposed that a
subepithelial calcification of renal papilla becomes the
nidus of COM papillary calculi, as a consequence of the
disruption of the papillary epithelial layer by the HAP
plaque [18-24]. Recently, it was found that in patients
susceptible to the development of calcium renal calculi,
plaque is initiated in thin-loop basement membranes,
basement membranes of collecting tubules, and the vasa
recta [21-24].
This study aimed to establish relations between calci￾fied deposits in renal papillae and the development and
morphology of corresponding COM papillary renal
calculi.
Methods
Patients and samples
From the recently collected papillary calculi, four patients
with chronic stone formation requiring retrograde
intrarenal surgery (RIRS) were selected. All these patients
have previously spontaneously expelled some calculi, that
were available for study, and none was submitted to previ￾ous urologic surgery. Their medical histories and lifestyle
habits were reviewed, and their renal calculi and urine
samples were obtained. The papillae of these patients were
observed by flexible ureterorenoscopy. The study was a
retrospective evaluation of clinical patient information.
Each volunteer provided written informed consent for
their clinical information to be published.
Renal calculi
The collected stones were dried, placed in sterile con￾tainers, and examined by stereoscopic microscopy
(Optomic, Madrid, Spain), infrared spectrometry (Infrared
Spectroscope Bruker IFS 66, Bruker, Ettlingen, Germany),
and scanning electron microscopy (Hitachi S-3400N;
Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan), and microanalyzed by X-ray
energy dispersion spectrometry (XFlash Detector 4010,
Bruker AXS, Berlin, Germany) [25].
Following direct examination of the external aspect of
each stone by stereoscopic microscopy, each calculus
was sectioned into two parts along a plane as near as
possible to the geometric center. The internal structure
and core were assessed using scanning electron micros￾copy and X-ray microanalysis (or IR spectrometry),
which were used to identify the microcomponents
present in the core and to confirm the papillary origin of
these stones by examination of the concave external
cavity. COM papillary calculi were identified; a typical
papillary COM stone (Figure 1) consists of an eccentric
core located near the concave zone, where it attaches to
the papillae, and a radially striated convex peripheral
layer [25]. The COM papillary calculi were classified
according our classification [26] in four main types
(I to IV). Type I included small calculi in which COM
columnar crystals begin to develop in the concave zone
in close contact with papillary tissue. Type II calculi
contained a hydroxyapatite core located in or near the
concave zone. Type III consisted of calculi that devel￾oped on the tip of the papillae and in the concave zone,
containing hydroxyapatite, calcified tissue, and calcified
tubules. Type IV consisted of papillary calculi in which
the core, which is situated near, but not in, the concave
zone, is formed by intergrown COM crystals and
organic matter.
Analysis of serum and urine samples
All subjects were on an unregulated diet at the time of
urine collection and none of the stone-formers was re￾ceiving any pharmacological treatment. Blood was drawn
from each patient, and serum was separated. Patients
with renal failure or infected urine were excluded. Urine
was collected over 24 hours into sterile flasks containing
thymol as a preservative and immediately refrigerated.
Urinary volume was recorded and the samples were
stored at −20°C until analyzed. Normally, urine was
collected 1–2 months after stone passage/removal.
Serum and urinary calcium, magnesium and phosphorous
concentrations were measured by inductively coupled
plasma atomic spectroscopy, urate and creatinine concen￾trations were measured using test kits (Roche Modular Ana￾lytics), and citrate and oxalate concentrations were
measured using R-Biopharm enzymatic test kits. Urinary
biochemical parameters were considered potential lithogenic
factors under abnormal conditions.
Results
Patient 1 was a 73-year-old woman with a 30-year
history of nephrolithiasis, as well as a history of rheuma￾toid arthritis and arterial hypertension. She had been
treated with methotrexate, furosemide and omeprazole.
This patient experienced diverse renal colic episodes and
spontaneously expelled 11 renal calculi, nine of which
were papillary. The analysis of these calculi is summa￾rized in Figure 1. Urinary biochemical analysis (Table 1)

showed no alterations. Numerous (>3) subepithelial HAP
deposits were present in the papillae of this patient.
Of the nine papillary calculi retrieved from patient 1,
six had HAP deposits located in or near the concave
zone of the calculus (Figure 1c, 1d). These calculi were
associated with papillary lateral extruded HAP deposits,
indicating that they were type II papillary calculi [26].
Another two calculi were associated with lateral
subepithelial HAP deposits (Figure 1a, 1b), correspond￾ing to type I [26]. One calculus developed on the tip of
the papillae (Figure 1e, 1f ) and corresponded to type III
[26]. Finally, one calculus had a core, located near the
concave zone, formed by a combination of COM crystals
and organic matter (Figure 1g, 1h), corresponding to a
type IV papillary calculus [26].
Patient 2 was a 40-year-old man with a history of
nephrolithiasis. He had no other pathology or health
problem of significance. This patient had consumed a
hyperproteic diet (very rich in meat) and spontaneously
expelled a typical calculus of calcium oxalate dihydrate.
Urinary biochemical analysis (Table 1) showed that this pa￾tient had hypercalciuria and high oxaluria. Endoscopic im￾ages of his papillae showed numerous (> 3) subepithelial
HAP deposits (Figure 2a).
Patient 3 was a 60-year-old man with a history of
nephrolithiasis. He had no other pathology or health
problem of significance. He spontaneously expelled a
COM papillary calculus, corresponding to type IV (Figure 3).
Urinary biochemical analysis (Table 1) showed high
oxaluria but abnormally low calciuria (1.5 mmol/L).
Endoscopic images of his papillae showed two attached
calculi, one at the top and the other in a lateral position
(Figure 2b). Moreover, these papillae showed numerous
(> 3) subepithelial HAP deposits.
Patient 4 was a 41-year-old man with nephrolithiasis
and hyperuricemia, but no other pathology or significant
health problem. The patient spontaneously expelled a
typical calcium oxalate dihydrate calculus, partially
transformed into COM. Urinary biochemical analysis
(Table 1) showed that this patient had hypercalciuria
and hyperphosphaturia. Endoscopic images showed a
small COM calculus attached to one side of the papillae
(Figure 2c). In addition, the papillae of this patient
showed numerous (> 3) subepithelial HAP deposits.
Discussion
The results in our patients indicate that COM papillary
calculi result from subepithelial lesions in the tip of the
papilla, emerging in a renal calyx. Most lesions undergo
calcification by HAP; these deposits grow and erode the
epithelium covering the papillae. When these deposits
come into contact with urine, they start the development

of a COM calculus due to the permanent supersatur￾ation of calcium oxalate in urine and to the high capacity
of HAP to act as a heterogeneous nucleant of COM.
These calcifications are generated in the thin-loop base￾ment membranes or near the vasa recta [27,28], both of
which are collagen-rich regions [28]. Due to the presence
of carboxylate groups, this altered collagen can act as a
heterogeneous nucleant of HAP [29].
The concave zone of papillary calculi can contain a
range of calcified lesions, from little HAP residues to
typical well-developed HAP plaques, also known as
Randall's plaques. The morphology of each calculus and
the amount of detected HAP will depend on both the
calculus and the location of each calcified injury. HAP
plaques may be located in a subepithelial position, alte￾ring the epithelium covering the papillae and resulting
in the direct deposit of COM crystals on the damaged
epithelium [27]. Less frequently, the injury may be in
close contact with the epithelium covering the papillae;
expansion of the injury may alter the epithelium,
allowing the nucleation of COM crystals. These COM
calculi will not contain HAP in their starting zone.
These results indicate that COM papillary calculi
might be generated from subepithelial lesions on the tip
of the renal papillae, and that the morphology of these
COM calculi mainly depends on the location of the
injury. Hence, the examination of a single calculus does
not supply relevant information about the origin of the

injury and the severity of the general calculogenesis
process. The possible causes of injury may be deduced
from the clinical data and lifestyle of each patient [26].
Thus, the papillary injuries in patient 1 may be due to
the chronic consumption of drugs to treat her rheuma￾toid arthritis, as well as to arterial hypertension. The
papillary tissue injuries in patients 2 and 3 may have
been due to high urinary oxalate, and the injury in pa￾tient 4 may have been due to hyperuricemia observed on
the clinical history of the patient.
Dystrophic mineralization is commonly observed in
soft tissues as a result of injury. Although most soft
tissues can undergo calcification, kidney, tendons, and
cardiovascular tissues appear particularly prone to devel￾oping this pathology [30]. Although the development of
tissue calcification depends on a pre-existing injury,
which acts as an inducer, the continuation of this
process is due to modulators and/or a deficiency in
crystallization inhibitors [31-37]. For example, some
carboxy proteins, such as osteopontin, can bind to HAP,
recruiting macrophages that remove these calcifications
or prevent their progression [31-36]. The inhibition of
crystallization, preventing HAP development (nucleation
and growth), may be due to low-molecular weight￾compounds, such as pyrophosphate, magnesium and
phytate [2,37,38]. The images of the papillae in our pa￾tients suggest that many subepithelial calcifications were
present in all four, although the number of papillary
calculi generated were substantially lower, suggesting
that some of these subepithelial calcifications did not
progress further and were reabsorbed. An evaluation of
Randall’s plaque theory of nephrolithiasis in patients
with a unilateral single papillary calculus showed that
computed tomography attenuation values (Hounsfield
units) of all papillae on the affected side were signifi￾cantly greater in patients with stone formation than in
those without stone formation [39]. In contrast, no
significant differences were found between the affected
and non-affected sides of patients with stone formation
[39], this demonstrating that not all internal calcification
progress further to forming stones.
Conclusions
Although tissue calcification depends on a pre-existing
injury, the continuation of this process is due to modula￾tors and/or crystallization inhibitors deficiency. Since
calculus morphology and the amount of detected HAP
are dependent on the location and widespread of calci￾fied injury, all types of papillary COM calculi can be
found in the same patient. All patients had large num￾bers of subepithelial calcifications, with fewer papillary
calculi, demonstrating that some subepithelial calcifica￾tions did not further evolve and were reabsorbed. A high
number of subepithelial calcifications increases the
likelihood that some will be transformed into COM papil￾lary calculi. Thus, when papillary COM calculi are identi￾fied, the main objective to avoid recurrent episodes,
should be the identification and elimination of the cause
that originates the intrapapillary injury (since in such cases
it is the main cause of stone development). Obviously, an
adequate level of crystallization inhibitors and the proper
activity of the immune system can favorably contribute to
avoid the development of these calculi. As an important
limitation of this study, it must be considered that a series
of only four patients were included due the difficulty to
find patients with the required inclusion criteria.
