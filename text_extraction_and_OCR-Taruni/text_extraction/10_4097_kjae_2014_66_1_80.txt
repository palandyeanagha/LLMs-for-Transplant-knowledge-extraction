Torsade de pointes (TdP) is an uncommon and specific form of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, associated with a 
prolonged QT interval. Prolongation of the QT interval is the most widely recognized electrophysiological abnormality 
in patients with liver cirrhosis. We observed a case of TdP leading to cardiopulmonary resuscitation after the induction 
of general anesthesia, in a patient with liver cirrhosis scheduled for emergency cadaveric donor liver transplantation. The 
patient had mild QT prolongation on preoperative electrocardiography with a corrected QT (QTc) interval of 455 ms. 
Drugs used in the preoperative period can elongate cardiac repolarization. Sevoflurane and 5-hydroxytryptamine type 3 
receptor antagonists such as palonsetron, used during general anesthesia may have triggered further QT prolongation, 
producing a fatal condition such as TdP. More caution and consideration in selecting drugs for anesthetic management 
are necessary for liver cirrhosis patients, especially in patients with preoperative QT prolongation. (Korean J Anesthesiol

Torsade de pointes (TdP) is an uncommon and specific form 
of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, characterized by a grad￾ual change in the amplitude and twisting of the QRS complex 
around the isoelectric line. TdP is associated with a prolonged 
QT interval, which is the most common electrocardiographic 
(ECG) finding in patients with liver cirrhosis. Abnormal cardiac 
repolarization may affect a patient’s survival during major sur￾gery, including liver transplantation [1]. Our report describes 
a case of TdP leading to cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) 
after the induction of general anesthesia in a liver transplanta￾tion recipient. The patient had mild corrected QT (QTc) interval 
prolongation on preoperative ECG. We suggest that sevoflurane 
and 5-hydroxytryptamine type 3 receptor antagonist used dur￾ing the induction of anesthesia may have been a triggering cause 
of TdP in a patient with liver cirrhosis.

Case Report 
A 53-year old male (height 173.6 cm, weight 75.6 kg) was 
scheduled for emergency cadaveric donor liver transplantation 
due to hepatitis B virus-related liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular 
carcinoma. Microvascular angina was diagnosed 2 years earlier 
with atypical chest pain. Coronary angiography at that time 
showed no significant stenotic findings. The patient was diag￾nosed with atrial fibrillation at the same time, and he was started 
on nicorandile, molsidomine, isosorbide dinitrate, digoxin, 
furosemide, and spironolactone. An anticoagulant was excluded 
due to bleeding tendencies. Furthermore, the patient had liver 
cirrhosis-related diabetes mellitus, portal hypertensive gastropa￾thy, and esophageal varix. 
ECG was performed just before surgery and showed atrial 
fibrillation with a normal heart rate (Fig. 1). The calculated QTc 
interval was 455 ms. The patient had mild mitral regurgitation 
and tricuspid regurgitation, but no regional wall motion abnor￾mality was seen on preoperative echocardiography. The calcu￾lated left ventricular ejection fraction was 68%, and the mean 
pulmonary arterial pressure was 24 mmHg. The PT INR was 
1.38, total bilirubin was 2.2 mg/dl, platelet count was 48,000 /μl, 
and albumin was 2.5 g/dl. Other blood test findings were within 
normal limits. 
Without preoperative medication, the patient entered the op￾erating room and his vital signs were measured immediately. His 
blood pressure (BP) was 117/73 mmHg, heart rate (HR) was 80 
beats/min, and his pulse oximetry oxygen saturation (SpO2) was 
99%. After preoxygenation with a mask by applying 100% O2
at 6 L/min for a few minutes, palonsetron 0.075 mg, lidocaine 
40 mg, and propofol 120 mg were administered intravenously. 
After the patient lost consciousness, manual assisted ventilation 
was performed with 100% O2 at 6 L/min and 5 vol% sevoflu￾rane; in addition, rocuronium 50 mg was injected. With full 
relaxation, the patient’s trachea was intubated using a cuffed 7.5 
mm endotracheal tube without difficulty. The radial and femoral 
arteries were cannulated, followed by continuous arterial blood 
pressure monitoring. A central venous catheter (AVA HF; Ed￾wards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA, USA) was placed at the right in￾ternal jugular vein with no resistance or difficulty. A pulmonary 
artery catheter (Swan-Ganz CCOmbo; Edwards Lifesciences, 
Irvine, CA, USA) was inserted and pulmonary artery pressure 
monitoring was started. By ECG, no clinically significant change 
occurred during insertion of the pulmonary artery catheter. The 
catheter’s position was checked with a chest X-ray. Anesthesia 
was maintained with 0.7 L/min O2, 1.3 L/min air, and 1.5-4.0 
vol% sevoflurane. Initial arterial blood gas analysis (ABGA) re￾vealed normal electrolyte levels and adequate oxygenation. ECG 
showed atrial fibrillation, but no clinically significant abnormal 
change was observed. 
At 50 minutes after the patient’s arrival, the surgeon started to 
prepare for surgery. At that time, sudden-onset large QRS tachy￾cardia (Fig. 2B) appeared, and the femoral and radial arterial 
waves became flat. The end tidal CO2 (ETCO2) pressure dropped 
rapidly, from 35 to 13 mmHg. Epinephrine 100 μg and calcium 
chloride 300 mg were administered twice. One of the surgeons 
started cardiac compression immediately, and mechanical ventila￾tion was continued with 100% O2. Epinephrine 1 mg was injected 
intravenously. During CPR, defibrillation was performed four 
times using 150-200 J, and epinephrine 1 mg was administered 
intravenously every 3-5 minutes. Amiodarone 300 mg mixed 
with 100 ml of normal saline was administered. Additionally, 
magnesium sulfate 2 g and lidocaine 70 mg were injected intrave￾nously. Calcium chloride, regular insulin, and sodium bicarbonate 
were also administered after checking ABGA (Table 1). During 
CPR, a bloody secretion started to come out of the endotracheal 
Fig. 1. Preoperative electrocardiography. The calculated corrected QT 
interval from lead II is 455 ms.

tube, and the peak inspiratory pressure increased. We repeatedly 
suctioned the endotracheal tube, and alveolar recruitment via 
manual bagging was attempted a few times.
After 30 minutes of CPR and the last defibrillation, large 
QRS tachycardia disappeared and ECG revealed a normal sinus 
rhythm. Simultaneously, the femoral and radial arterial waves 
recovered to normal wave forms. The patient’s systolic BP was 
80-85 mmHg, his HR was 40-45 beats/min, and ETCO2 was 
17-19 mmHg. After the return of spontaneous circulation, we 
loaded 50 μg/kg milrinone intravenously and started continu￾ous infusion of milrinone at 0.5 μg/kg/min and epinephrine at 
0.1 μg/kg/min. Regular insulin, sodium bicarbonate, and vaso￾pressin were also administered. The patient’s temperature was 
34.7o
C, and both pupils were dilated without a light reflex. 
A few minutes later, the patient’s SpO2 increased to 100%, 
and ETCO2 increased to 28 mmHg. The patient’s vital signs sta￾bilized at a HR of 80-85 beats/min, systolic BP over 100 mmHg, 
and mean BP over 80 mmHg. Without proceeding with the 
operation, the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit 
(ICU). The total exposure time to anesthesia was about 110 min￾utes. 1 L of crystalloid and 400 ml of colloid were infused, and 
the patient’s urine output was 30 ml during anesthesia. On arriv￾al at the ICU, the patient’s BP was 98/62/76 mmHg, his SpO2 was 
100%, and ECG showed atrial fibrillation with a HR of 80 beats/
min. The patient’s pupil reflex returned to a normal response. 
Electrolytes and cardiac enzymes were evaluated. Neither hy￾pokalemia nor hypocalcemia was detected, and all electrolyte 
values were within normal levels. The patient’s CK was 106 IU/L, 
CK-MB was 2.6 ng/ml, and Troponin I was slightly elevated to 
0.10 ng/ml. Bedside echocardiography revealed no regional wall 
motion abnormality or evidence of myocardial ischemia. 
On the second day of ICU admission, pulse-less large QRS 
tachycardia appeared twice. Both events were terminated after 
applying defibrillation using 150 J and cardiac compression for 2 
minutes. Metabolic acidosis, intravascular volume loss, and pul￾monary edema were aggravated and the patient’s BP and SpO2
continued to decrease. On the fourth day in the ICU, the patient 
expired. ECG showed a marked prolonged QTc interval (Fig. 3). 
Nevertheless, cardiac echocardiography performed on the day 
of the patient’s expiry showed normal findings. No regional wall 
motion abnormality was observed, and the left ventricular wall 
thickness was normal with a calculated ejection fraction of 56%. 
The patient’s systolic pulmonary arterial pressure was 33 mmHg.
Discussion
Long QT syndrome is a congenital or acquired disorder of 
cardiac ion channels, characterized by heterogeneity in cellular 
repolarization and precipitation of tachyarrhythmias [2]. The 
character of this syndrome is a marked prolongation of ven￾tricular repolarization, including QT interval prolongation and 
T wave abnormalities leading to ventricular tachycardia, such 
as TdP and ventricular fibrillation [3]. Although a normal value 
has not been established, QTc intervals longer than 440 ms are 
generally considered to indicate prolonged QT. As in the present 
case, a prolonged QTc interval is related to sudden death and 
poor survival in patients with various diseases [3,4].

corrected QT interval in lead II is over 500 ms.

Prolongation of the QT interval is the most widely recog￾nized electrophysiological abnormality in liver cirrhosis and has 
been observed in about half of patients with liver cirrhosis [1,5,6]. 
Several investigations have reported that QT prolongation in￾creases with the severity of liver disease, but it can also occur in 
patients with well-compensated cirrhosis [1,5,6]. Bal and Thu￾luvath [5] demonstrated an association between liver cirrhosis 
and QT prolongation, showing that a worsening of the Child￾Pugh score was associated with further prolongation of the QT 
interval. Some investigators have demonstrated that the QT 
interval is an additional prognostic factor for life expectancy [7]. 
The present patient had Child-Pugh class C liver cirrhosis with 
numerous accompanying complications. The QTc calculated by 
preoperative ECG was 455 ms. 
Several drugs used in the perioperative period could induce 
the lengthening of cardiac repolarization [8,9]. In many ECG 
studies, sevoflurane has been shown to lengthen the QT interval 
during the induction of inhalational anesthesia [8,10]. 5-Hy￾droxytryptamine type 3 receptor antagonists commonly used to 
prevent or treat postoperative nausea and vomiting, have also 
been demonstrated to induce QT prolongation [11]. In our case, 
palonsetron was administered during the induction of anesthe￾sia and sevoflurane was used to maintain anesthesia. Palonse￾tron is a 5-hydroxytryptamine type 3 receptor antagonist. Thus, 
palonsetron may have been an aggravating factor in QT prolon￾gation, although its effect on the QT interval has not yet been 
specifically investigated. A few seconds before the occurrence 
of TdP, the QTc interval was prolonged to 492 ms (Fig. 2A). TdP 
only occurred before any surgical procedure, so the anesthetic 
agents used during induction are suspected to be the most prob￾able cause. That no sympathetic hyperactivity was seen before 
the occurrence of TdP and ABGA performed just before the ini￾tiation of TdP was within normal limits support this. Although 
the patient had diagnosed microvascular angina, preoperative 
ECG showed only atrial fibrillation and no evidence of myo￾cardial ischemia. Preoperative cardiac echocardiography and 
coronary angiography revealed normal findings. Furthermore, 
cardiac echocardiography and cardiac enzymes evaluated after 
CPR did not indicate any ischemic insult. Atrial fibrillation may 
have been a contributing factor in the occurrence of TdP; how￾ever it is hard to ascribe myocardial ischemia as a major cause of 
TdP.
We undertook a retrospective analysis of the ECG waveform 
during anesthesia and found that TdP was the initiating ECG 
form during the patient’s arrhythmia and arrest. Ventricular pre￾mature beats occurred, and the R-on-T phenomenon preceded 
TdP (Figs. 2C and 2D). Unfortunately, we did not know that TdP 
was the first ECG form at the time of arrest; thus, we managed 
the patient’s arrhythmia according to standard CPR guidelines. 
We administered amiodarone intravenously, which may have 
aggravated the QT prolongation. Amiodarone is known to pro￾long the QT interval, but with a low incidence of proarrhythmic 
events [12]. Nevertheless, QT prolongation with subsequent TdP 
after amiodarone therapy potentially resulting in ventricular 
fibrillation has been repeatedly reported [13]. 
Preoperative management of patients with long QT syn￾drome should be performed in a comfortable environment. 
Midazolam and fentanyl can be used to prevent anxiolysis with￾out complications [14]. The use of drugs known to prolong the 
QT interval should be avoided as far as possible. Perioperative 
infusion of magnesium sulfate is recommended as prophylaxis 
against TdP [14]. A defibrillator and transvenous pacing wires 
and leads should be prepared for prompt use [2,15]. Hypother￾mia should be avoided since it may prolong the QT interval, 
possibly through the delayed recovery of inactivated sodium 
channels [2,14,15]. 
Magnesium sulfate is the treatment of choice for TdP [14]. 
Serum electrolyte levels should be checked and corrected within 
normal limits. Temporary transvenous pacing can be effective 
in some patients. Defibrillation and CPR may be necessary and 
lidocaine may be useful in terminating arrhythmia [14].
In conclusion, patients with liver cirrhosis may have pre￾operative QT prolongation, but insufficient awareness of this 
electrophysiological abnormality is common. Sevoflurane and 
5-hydroxytryptamine type 3 receptor antagonists used during 
anesthesia can trigger further QT prolongation. This can lead 
to fatal conditions, including TdP, as in the present case. More 
caution and consideration when selecting drugs and inhalation 
agents during anesthetic management are necessary for patients 
with liver cirrhosis, especially patients with preoperative QT 
prolongation. In particular, 5-hydroxytryptamine type 3 recep￾tor antagonists should be avoided and replaced with other anti￾emetic drugs, and sevoflurane should be used with caution. 
Vital signs and ECG should be carefully monitored, and the QTc 
should be evaluated continuously during anesthesia if possible. 
Furthermore, in vulnerable patients with preoperative QT pro￾longation, TdP should be considered as a possible cause when 
fatal arrhythmia occurs. Deterioration in a patient’s condition 
due to an inappropriate medication such as amiodarone can be 
prevented by scrupulous attention and an adequate diagnosis. 
Accurate and expeditious management is also required.
