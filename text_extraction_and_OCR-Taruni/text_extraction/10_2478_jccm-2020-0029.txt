Abstract
Intra-cardiac thrombosis is one of the most devastating complications during liver transplantation. In the majority of 
cases, ICT, followed by massive pulmonary embolism, is commonly occurring shortly after liver graft reperfusion, but 
it has been reported to occur at any stage of the surgery. We present a series of 3 cases of intra-cardiac thrombosis 
during orthotopic liver transplantation surgery, including a case of four-chamber intra-cardiac clot formation during 
the pre-anhepatic stage. This article represents a single-centre 14 year-long experience. Intra-operative TEE is the 
gold standard to diagnose intra-cardiac thrombosis, monitoring its size, location and dynamics, as well as myocardial 
performance and the effects of resuscitation efforts.

Introduction
Substantial perioperative blood loss, pre-existing and 
on-going coagulopathy and blood transfusion side 
effects are major concerns in the perioperative man￾agement of liver transplant recipients. Also, hyperco￾agulability and associated risk for intra-cardiac and 
intra-vascular obstructive clot formation have been 
recognized as substantial threats for patient and graft 
survival. 
Abnormal thrombus formation mechanisms during 
liver transplant remain poorly understood, especially 
in the presence of impaired coagulation factor synthe￾sis and consumption-related deficits in end-stage liver 
disease (ESLD). Notwithstanding the growing num￾ber of reported cases and abundancy of experimental 
and clinical studies of coagulopathy, both coagula￾tion deficit and hypercoagulable states, the abnormal 
thrombus formation, resulting in life-threatening flow 
obstructions, remains mostly unpredictable, let alone 
preventable.
Intra-cardiac thrombosis (ICT) formation during 
orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) is a catastrophic 
event, frequently leading to a fatal outcome. It may oc￾cur at any stage of surgery, with increased incidence in 
the period immediately following the graft reperfusion. 
Reported incidence of ICT has been between 0.71% -
6.25%, with overall mortality rate of 68% - 82% intra￾operatively [1, 2].
A few cases of massive ICT, where obstructive clot 
material was successfully removed with subsequent pa￾tient survival, have been reported [3-5]. However, in 
the majority of cases, the rapid development of circula￾tory shock, followed by cardiac arrest due to flow ob￾struction, almost invariably leads to a poor outcome. 
Fatal outcomes have been observed despite timely em￾ployed intraoperative Trans-esophageal Eco-cardiog￾raphy (TEE) diagnostics, cardio-pulmonary resuscita￾tion (CPR), use of anticoagulants, thrombolytics, and 
other treatment options. The hypercoagulability state, 
resulting in obstructive thrombus formation during 
liver transplantation, presents a challenge for the an￾aesthesia provider, and a proper solution is yet to be 
found.
In this case series, three cases of intracardiac throm￾bus formation during liver transplantation, presenting 
a single-centre 14-years -long experience are reported.

Case 1
A 59-year-old female with ESLD secondary to non￾alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and a “Model for 
End-Stage Liver Disease” score (MELD) of 35, was pre￾sented for a liver transplant. 
The decision to proceed with the liver transplant had 
been made by the Liver Transplant Selection Commit￾tee a few months earlier. As soon as the organ offer was 
accepted, the patient was admitted to the University of 
Washington Medical Center, Seattle, WA, USA, about 
24 hours before the expected surgery start. 
Her past medical history was notable for end-stage 
renal disease (ESRD) on dialysis due to hepato-re￾nal syndrome, and severe pulmonary hypertension 
(PHTN).
Her severe PHTN improved significantly with silde￾nafil citrate tablets, (VIAGRA®; Pfizer, New York, US) 
for oral use. This resulted in a steady decrease in pul￾monary artery systolic pressure (PASP) from 79-84 
mmHg to mid-40s. 
Pre-operative trans-thoracic ECO cardiography 
(TTE) showed a normal left ventricular (LV) size and 
systolic function with an estimated ejection fraction 
(EF) of 70%., moderately elevated PASP (43-48 mm 
Hg) based on normal right atrial pressure (0-5 mm 
Hg), moderate dilation of RA, and mildly dilated LV 
with normal systolic function. Laboratory tests showed 
a hematocrit of 19%, international normalised ra￾tio (INR) 2.1, prothrombin time (PT) 23.3”, platelets 
(PLT) 24,000/μl, and fibrinogen (Fib) 121mg/dl.
During the pre-anhepatic phase, four units of red 
blood cells (RBCs), two units of fresh frozen plasma 
(FFP), and one unit of platelets (PLT) were transfused. 
This resulted in an improvement of coagulation status 
(INR up to 1.9, PT to 19.2”, Fib to 135 mg/dl., PLT up 
to 43,000/ μl). 
A thromboelastogram (TEG) showed signs of co￾agulation deficit; prolonged r of 10’(n:4-8’) and K of 
8’(n:1-4’)- times, (maximum amplitude (MA) of 41mm 
(n:55-73mm). There were no signs of fibrinolysis, lysis 
percentage<1.5%, n: 0-8%. 
Throughout most of the pre-anhepatic phase, the 
patient remained stable and inotropic support was not 
required. About 90 minutes into the pre-anhepatic 
phase, the patient suddenly developed circulatory col￾lapse, followed shortly after that by cardiogenic shock 
and cardiac arrest. 
CPR was immediately initiated. A TEE was per￾formed and showed ICT in all four cardiac cham￾bers and also within the tricuspid, aortic and mitral 
valves. After continued CPR for about thirty minutes, 
the thrombus in the LA and the LV appeared to have 
cleared. However, it was still visualized in the RA. 
The LV shown severe wall motion abnormalities in 
the inferior and inferior-septal regions, RV functions 
appeared to be worse when compared to the last TEE; 
the free wall of the RV was akinetic. 
The possibility of acute myocardial infarction (MI), 
likely in the right coronary artery (RCA) distribution 
region, was considered. TEE video clips demonstrate 
clots located in all four chambers (Figure1; Online sup￾plementary video 1); a massive clot in mitral position 
on the biplane view (Figure 2; Online supplementary 
video 2); and clots in both ventricles, as demonstrated 
on Figure 3 (Online supplementary video 3), that also 
showed that right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) in￾flow-outflow was almost obstructed with a clot in AV.
An interventional radiology consultant obtained 
promptly after the discovery of the clot initially recom￾mended the removal of the thrombus in the interven￾tional radiology suite. 
Along with continuous CPR efforts and in prepara￾tion for the patient’s transport to the interventional ra￾diology suite, Heparin Sodium USP, (Pfizer, NJ, US), 
50,000 Units, has been administered intravenously by 
the anesthesiologist, as per institutional guidelines.
The restoration of effective circulation was unat￾tainable despite the concomitant administration of 
intravenous epinephrine (Epinephrine, International 
Medication Systems, Ltd., (IMS), South El Monte, 
California, US.), norepinephrine bitartrate (Levophed, 
Bitartart, Pfizer, NJ, US) and phenylephrine hydro￾chloride (Vazculep, Hikma Pharmaceuticals USA Inc. 
Eatontown, NJ USA) infusions at high-rates of 1 mcg/
kg/min, 1.2 mcg/kg/min and 2.4 mcg/kg/min, respec￾tively, sodium bicarbonate boluses each 50 mEq to a 
total of 150 mEq, epinephrine boluses, 1 mg each to 
a total of 9 mg, given intravenously, and vasopressin 
(Vasostrict, Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, US and Ger￾many) boluses, 2-4 units up to a total of 24 units, given 
intravenously. Continuous CPR was also undertaken 
concurrently.
Considering the TEE findings, specifically the 
presence of flow-obstructing clots in all four cardiac 
chambers and also the absence of spontaneous effec-

tive circulation, the transplant surgery was aborted. 
After consulting again with the interventional radiol￾ogy team, carrying out the removal of clots was now 
considered futile, and the decision has been made to 
transfer the patient to the critical care unit. The patient 
expired within one hour, despite continuous CPR and 
vasoactive agents’ infusions.
Case 2
A 60-year-old female with ESLD secondary to hepa￾tocellular carcinoma (HCC) and hepatitis C, a MELD 
score of 22, was presented for liver transplant.
The decision to proceed with the liver transplant had 
been approved by Liver Transplant Selection Commit￾tee approximately three months earlier. As soon as the 
organ offer was accepted, the patient was admitted to 
the University of Washington Medical Center, Seattle, 
WA, USA, about 48 hours before the expected surgery 
start.
Pre-operative TTE demonstrated a normal LV sys￾tolic function with an LVEF of 60-70%, and a mild re￾laxation abnormality. Minimal aortic regurgitation of a 
normal-appearing aortic valve was detected. The stress 
ECO showed an appropriate hemodynamic response to 
pharmacologic stress without evidence of myocardial 
ischemia.
Baseline laboratory results showed a mild coagula￾tion deficit (INR of 2.2, Fib of 90 mg/dl, PLT of 65,000 /
μl, Hematocrit (Hct) of 24%, and baseline TEG showed 
signs of a mild coagulation deficit (r 8’, K 6’, MA 
47mm, lysis 0.9%) 
During the pre-anhepatic phase, the patient be￾came progressively hemodynamically unstable. While 
her cardiac output (CO) decreased from baseline 11 
to 7-8 L/min, the systemic vascular resistance (SVR) 
increased minimally from mid-200 to 430 dynes/sec￾onds/cm-5 with vasopressors’ support. However, the 
pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP) steadily in￾creased from a baseline of 26-32 up to 45-50 mmHg. 
In anticipation of worsening pulmonary hypertension 
after graft reperfusion, the decision had been made to 
initiate nitric oxide inhalation (INOmax®, INOThera￾peutics LLC, New Jersey, US) at 25 ppm, as per institu￾tional guidelines. 
Approximately 20 minutes into the NO administra￾tion, the TEE demonstrated evidence of moderate RV 
dilation and mild-to-moderate diastolic dysfunction. 
LV function was deemed unchanged. 
Liver graft re-circulation was performed slowly 
over approximately ten minutes. TEE assessment, per￾formed after attaining hemodynamic stability follow￾ing the graft reperfusion, approximately ten minutes 
after portal vein de-clamping, was suggestive of a non￾obstructive right atrial clot, taking up to more than 
50% of its volume.

After completion of the hepatic artery anastomosis, 
the patient became progressively acidotic and hemo￾dynamically unstable, with rapidly declining arterial 
blood pressure, and TEE-detected evidence of worsen￾ing both RV systolic and diastolic functions. 
After obtaining laboratory results, that showed a 
Hct of 18 and an INR of 2.6, volume status optimiza￾tion and coagulation deficit correction were undertak￾en. This the included IV infusion of 500 ml of 5% albu￾min (Albumin Human, Mitsubishi Chemical Holdings 
America Inc. New York NY,& Virginia VA), and the 
transfusion of four units of red blood cells, and two 
units of FFP. 
However, due to a rapid decline of myocardial per￾formance, resulting in circulatory collapse, CPR was 
initiated. Effective perfusion was restored for about 
eight minutes, but then heart rhythm deteriorated to a 
terminal slow junctional pattern, followed by an asys￾tolic arrest. 
Amidst continuous resuscitation efforts, a pericar￾diotomy was performed to allow direct manual heart 
compressions. TEE revealed a large clot, obstructing 
the right atrium and most of the right ventricle, with a 
smaller clot in the pulmonary artery, almost complete￾ly blocking forward flow (Figure 4; Online supplemen￾tary video 4). 
Despite prolonged open cardiac massage, the myo￾cardial contractions and effective circulation could not 
be restored, and the patient expired.
Case 3
A 48-year-old male with ESLD (MELD score 14) sec￾ondary to hepatitis C (HCV)-induced cirrhosis, and 
hepatocellular carcinoma was admitted for liver trans￾plantation. 
The decision to proceed with the liver transplant has 
been approved by the Liver Transplant Selection Com￾mittee less than one month earlier. As soon as the organ 
offer was accepted, the patient was admitted to the Uni￾versity of Washington Medical Center, Seattle, WA, USA, 
about forty-eight hours before expected surgery start.
A pre-operative TTE demonstrated a mild LA en￾largement and an estimated RV systolic pressure of 
30mmHg which suggested a degree of tricuspid regur￾gitation. LV functions were within the normal range, 
EF of 76%. A stress ECO revealed no evidence of myo￾cardial ischemia or infarction. 
Baseline laboratory tests showed an international 
normalized ratio) of 1.9, a fibrinogen concentration 
of 174mg/dl, platelets 93,000/μl, and a hematocrit of 
29%. The pre-anhepatic phase of the surgery was un￾eventful. However, due to significant sclerosis in the 
retroperitoneum, the surgeons chose to use a bi-caval 
technique. The patient tolerated the inferior vena cava 
(IVC) clamping very well. 
After reperfusion of the liver graft, the patient was 
initially stable. His TEG shown signs of coagulation 
deficit (r and K times 10’ and 12’, respectively, MA 32 
mm, lysis 3.2%, INR 4.6, Fib 78 mg/dl, PLT 76,000/ μl, 
HCT of 21%), which was corrected with a transfusion 
of four units of FFP, one unit of cryoprecipitate, one 
unit of PLT, and three units of RBCs. 
After a short while, patient’s oxygen saturation 
dropped into the mid-80s, central venous pressure 
(CVP ) and the pulmonary artery systolic pressure 
(PASP) increased from an average of 8 cm Hg to 26 cm 
Hg and from 32 to 55 mm Hg, respectively.
Circulatory collapse ensued. Intraoperative TEE 
demonstrated massive clots in the RA, RV and the pul￾monary artery. RA and RV were severely dilated, and 
the LV appeared to be empty. Despite all resuscitative 
efforts, the patient condition continued to deteriorate 
rapidly. A thoracotomy was performed for direct man￾ual heart compressions. A cardiac surgery consult de￾termined that, given the prolonged downtime and the 
extensive amount of intracardiac clot, the situation was 
not salvageable. 
After prolonged, albeit unsuccessful CPR, effective 
circulation could not be restored, and the patient ex￾pired.

Discussion
Recent studies have suggested, that ESLD may not only 
be associated with coagulopathy, but also with hyper￾coagulation. These findings implied that the overall he￾mostatic abilities of the cirrhotic liver might not be as 
severely compromised as previously assumed. For ex￾ample, an almost doubled risk of pulmonary embolism 
in patients with liver disease compared to the general 
population was found in a large case-control study [6]. 
Intricate mechanisms of perioperative hypercoagula￾bility in liver transplant recipients, resulting in major 
obstructing vascular thrombotic events, are exceed￾ingly complex, and have already been reviewed and 
discussed in numerous publications [7, 8]. 
Early detection and accurate diagnosis of an intra￾cardiac thrombus - preferably in the process of forma￾tion - is critically important for patient survival, as well 
as in determining the choice and extent of treatment 
options. TEE provides means both for early diagnosis 
and monitoring of already settled thrombi, particularly 
for flow impediment and obstructions. The wide range 
of reported incidence of ICT (0.71% - 6.25%, with an 
intraoperative mortality rate of 68% - 82% [1, 2]) and 
ICT-associated mortality may be explained partially by 
non-universal intraoperative use of TEE during liver 
transplantation (hence lower likelihood of immediate 
thrombus detection).
Increased recognition of TEE as an efficient diag￾nostic/monitoring modality is likely related to the 
growing number of anaesthesia providers, receiving at 
least basic training with TEE certifications [9]. Recent 
surveys have demonstrated the routine use of TEE in 
only 38% to 40% of liver transplant centres, with TEE 
mostly used during catastrophic hemodynamic in￾stability and resuscitation efforts. There seems to be a 
gradual increase in TEE-use during anaesthesia for liv￾er transplantation. [10-12]. However, there are groups 
of researchers, advocating for and against making TEE 
as a standard monitoring modality for liver transplant 
anaesthesia care [13, 14]. 
A potential complication of the use of TEE in liver 
transplants may be haemorrhage, related to the inser￾tion and manipulation of a probe, with an estimated in￾cidence of 0.1-0.3% in cardiac surgery cases [15]. This 
may be more common in liver transplant recipients. 
Another issue with TEE is the potential inaccuracy of 
TEE- derived estimates of PA pressure, CVP, and CO. 
With a relatively high probability of PA pressure fluc￾tuations during portal and IVC clamping, and especial￾ly around graft reperfusion, the accurate estimation of 
it requires a high-quality image and an adequate tricus￾pid regurgitation. Cywinski J et al. [14] recommended 
that the Doppler signal must be aligned parallel to the 
regurgitant jet. This is sometimes difficult to achieve in 
situations of hemodynamic instability when it is need￾ed the most. On the other hand, PA catheter-derived 
numerical information is easily interpreted and may be 
immediately translated into therapeutic interventions. 
As it appears, for the time being, TEE may not yet re￾place the PA catheter as a monitoring modality. 
In all the present three cases, the diagnosis had been 
established by TEE. It is conceivable that continuous 
TEE-monitoring may be beneficial in the early detec￾tion of the ICT, thus potentially increasing the likeli￾hood of a better outcome. Despite the “pros and cons”, 
TEE remains an invaluable diagnostic tool, whose ca￾pabilities cannot be overestimated.
Therapeutic modalities for acute intracardiac throm￾bosis include administration of intraoperative heparin 
and systemic thrombolytics, surgical or interventional 
radiological clot removal procedures, and catheter-di￾rected thrombolytic therapy. It has been reported that 
systemic and catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) 
are potentially life-saving interventions in situations 
involving obstructing thrombus formation [16]. Pre￾cise, localized delivery of a thrombolytic agent reduces 
the risk for hemorrhagic complications in liver trans￾plant recipients with significant coagulopathy, due to 
lower dosage used, and improved outcomes have been 
reported [17]. Successful use of recombinant tissue 
plasminogen activator (tPA) for intraoperative treat￾ment of massive intracardiac and pulmonary throm￾boembolism have also been reported over the years in 
a few publications [18-20].
Hypercoagulability is considered a likely reason for 
left side thrombosis. Another important reason for the 
clot formation in the left heart chambers is a circula￾tory stasis. Reasons for stasis may be a very low CO (as 
in Case 1) or during inefficient CPR, or due to obstruc￾tion of the right-to-left circulation in cases of earlier 
right-sided thrombosis with pulmonary embolism. In 
all three cases here presented, the ICT manifested as 
a significant flow-obstructing mass, causing disastrous 
hemodynamic instability, with swift progression to cir￾culatory arrest. No warning signs of potential throm￾botic complication were observed. In every case, the 
patient demonstrated typical for ESLD coagulopathy, 
confirmed by TEG. Due to rapid development of circu￾latory shock, followed by a cardiac arrest, no attempt of

thrombus removal was undertaken in the three cases, 
since such interventions were deemed futile under the 
circumstances. 
Conclusions
Massive ICT formation is a rare, life-threatening com￾plication during liver transplantation, which remains 
mostly unpredictable and unpreventable, commonly 
leading to a poor outcome.
TEE is a valuable additional diagnostic and monitor￾ing modality during liver transplant anaesthesia. The 
main limitation for TEE use in liver transplantation is 
that, unlike a PA catheter, it cannot provide continu￾ous precise numerical information with alarm settings, 
that are immediately translatable into therapeutic in￾terventions. TEE remains a definitive diagnostic tool 
for early detection of intracardiac thrombus formation 
and monitoring of myocardial function.
