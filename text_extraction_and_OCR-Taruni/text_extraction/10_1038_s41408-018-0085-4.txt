Abstract
Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) include a group of clonal myeloid neoplasms characterized by cytopenias due to
ineffective hematopoiesis, abnormal blood and marrow cell morphology, and a risk of clonal evolution and
progression to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Because outcomes for patients with MDS are heterogeneous, individual
risk stratification using tools such as the revised International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS-R) is important in
managing patients—including selecting candidates for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (ASCT), the
only potentially curative therapy for MDS. The IPSS-R can be supplemented by molecular genetic testing, since certain
gene mutations such as TP53 influence risk independent of established clinicopathological variables. For lower risk
patients with symptomatic anemia, treatment with erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) or lenalidomide (especially
for those with deletion of chromosome 5q) can ameliorate symptoms. Some lower risk patients may be candidates for
immunosuppressive therapy, thrombopoiesis-stimulating agents, or a DNA hypomethylating agent (HMA; azacitidine
or decitabine). Among higher risk patients, transplant candidates should undergo ASCT as soon as possible, with HMAs
useful as a bridge to transplant. Non-transplant candidates should initiate HMA therapy and continue if tolerated until
disease progression. Supportive care with transfusions and antimicrobial drugs as needed remains important in all
groups.
Overview
Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are defined by inef￾fective hematopoiesis resulting in blood cytopenias, and
clonal instability with a risk of clonal evolution to acute
myeloid leukemia (AML)1,2
. Patients with MDS collec￾tively have a high symptom burden and are also at risk of
death from complications of cytopenias and AML3
. The
goals of therapy for patients with MDS are to reduce
disease-associated symptoms and the risk of disease pro￾gression and death, thereby improving both quality and
quantity of life4–6
.
Because the median age at diagnosis of MDS is ~70
years, patients frequently have comorbid conditions that
may influence outcomes and treatment approaches7,8
. For
instance, patients with established cardiovascular or pul￾monary disease tolerate anemia poorly, while those with
germline HFE mutations associated with hereditary
hemochromatosis may have an elevated risk of organ
toxicity from iron overload with repeated red cell trans￾fusions. Functional defects in neutrophils or platelets may
result in an infection or bleeding risk that is dispropor￾tionate to the degree of cytopenias9
.
Three drugs have been approved by the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) for use in MDS-related indications:
the orally administered immunomodulatory drug lenali￾domide, and two parenterally administered nucleoside
analogs that are DNA hypomethylating agents (HMA),
azacitidine, and decitabine. In addition to these agents,
there is extensive off-label use of the erythropoiesis￾stimulating agents (ESA) epoetin and darbepoetin in
MDS, which is supported by National Comprehensive
Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines and therefore reim￾bursed by Medicare as a compendium use10,11. No new
drugs have been approved for MDS-related indications
since decitabine’s FDA approval in 200612, underscoring

the importance of clinical trial enrollment; currently only
a small proportion of patients with MDS are enrolled in
prospective interventional studies.
Risk stratification
The most commonly used tool for risk stratification in
MDS is the 2012 revised International Prognostic Scoring
System (IPSS-R; Table 1), which was based on a multi￾variate assessment of clinicopathological variables and
outcomes in more than 7000 patients, conducted by the
International Working Group for Prognosis in MDS
(IWG-PM)13. The IPSS-R takes into account the number
and degree of cytopenias, proportion of blasts in the
marrow, and risk of the specific cytogenetic abnormalities
present. The IPSS-R stratifies patients into 5 risk groups;
collectively, the 2 lowest risk groups are often referred to
as ‘lower risk MDS’, while the 2 higher risk groups are
described as ‘higher risk MDS’.
The intermediate risk IPSS-R group is heterogeneous,
with some patients having a more indolent natural history
similar to lower risk MDS and others more aggressive
disease. This heterogeneity can be partly resolved by the
use of molecular genetic sequencing. While a number of
series have been published assessing the prognostic
importance of individual mutations, the IWG-PM is
currently assessing the utility of specific mutations in
more than 3000 patients14,15. Among DNA sequencing
series already reported, TP53, NRAS, ASXL1, and EZH2
mutations are consistently associated with poor outcomes
while SF3B1 mutations are associated with more favorable
outcomes16–18.
The IPSS-R has several limitations in addition to its lack
of molecular genetic information. For example, the IPSS￾R is only validated for adult patients with de novo disease
at the time of diagnosis, and it describes expected out￾comes for those treated with supportive care alone19,20.
Future prognostic tools will hopefully be validated for a
broader range of patients and will be dynamic, able to be
applied at any time in the disease course.
Patients with therapy-related disease (t-MDS) asso￾ciated with prior genotoxic exposure frequently have
TP53 mutations or PPM1D mutations and a complex
karyotype21. These patients were excluded from the IPSS￾R and should be considered to have very high risk disease.
Some patients with MDS have features of myeloproli￾ferative neoplasms, such as monocytosis (especially in
chronic myelomonocytic leukemia) or extensive marrow
fibrosis. These patients have a distinct pathbiology, with

over-representation of mutations such as JAK2, SRSF2,
SETBP1, CSF3R, and BCOR compared to patients with
MDS without proliferative features, and require a spe￾cialized treatment approach that is not discussed further
here22,23. Patients with secondary MDS after another
marrow failure syndrome (acquired aplastic anemia, par￾oxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, or a germline dis￾order like Fanconi anemia or dyskeratosis congenita) also
require a specially tailored approach.
Lower risk MDS
Some patients with MDS have mild cytopenias and are
asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis. Early treatment of
MDS is not known to be beneficial in terms of preventing
clonal evolution or death. Therefore, observation is appro￾priate for asymptomatic lower risk patients until their
cytopenias worsen or they become more symptomatic.
For patients with lower risk disease and anemia asso￾ciated with MDS, two parameters are important in treat￾ment choice (Fig. 1). First, the serum erythropoietin
(sEPO) level reflects endogenous renal response to anemia
and is a strong predictor of the likelihood of clinical
response to ESA24. Patients with lower risk MDS who have
a sEPO < 100 U/L have a greater than 70% chance of
responding to ESA, while for those patients with sEPO >
500 U/L, a trial of ESA is usually not warranted because
the response rate is <10%. Second, the presence of a
clonally restricted deletion of the long arm of chromosome
5 including band q31 (del5q) is associated with a high
erythroid response rate to lenalidomide (65–70% transfu￾sion independence, and 30–40% cytogenetic remis￾sion)25,26. Patients with a complex karyotype that includes
del5q and those with excess marrow blasts respond less
well to lenalidomide treatment than those whose disease
lacks these features. Lower risk MDS patients with anemia
who lack del5q have a 26% response rate to lenalidomide
therapy, and a brief trial of lenalidomide is reasonable in
such patients, although this usage is off-label27,28.
For patients with lower risk MDS who have other severe
cytopenias beyond anemia, the most appropriate treat￾ment approach is less clear29. Neutropenia in patients with
MDS often does respond to use of myeloid growth factors,
but these have never been shown to improve survival in
MDS and have minimal effect on reducing infection risk11.
The thrombopoiesis-stimulating agents (thrombopoietin
(TPO) mimetics) eltrombopag (oral) or romiplostim
(injectable) can reduce platelet transfusion needs and
clinically significant bleeding events in some patients with
severe thrombocytopenia30–33. Although a randomized
trial of romiplostim in lower risk MDS was discontinued
early by a data safety monitoring committee because of
excess leukemia and other disease progression in the active
treatment arm, a more recent update with five-year follow￾up shows no difference in outcomes between patients
treated on that study with romiplostim or placebo34. A
randomized trial with eltrombopag in combination with
azacitidine in a similar patient population also showed a
slight increase in progression in the active treatment
arm35. The dose of TPO mimetic required to improve
platelet count is typically higher in MDS than in the
labeled indication of immune thrombocytopenia36.
Because growth factors have somewhat limited efficacy
in MDS, anti-T cell immunosuppressive therapy (IST; e.g.,
antithrombocyte globulin, corticosteroids, and cyclos￾porine or tacrolimus) or HMA are frequently considered
for these patients, especially after failure of ESA or lena￾lidomide. Selection of appropriate patients for IST is
challenging, as published reports are inconsistent about
parameters that predict a higher likelihood of response;
however, excess blasts, therapy-related disease, and a
complex or monosomal karyotype predict lower like￾lihood of response to IST37.
A recent multicenter analysis of more than 300 MDS
patients treated with IST other than corticosteroid
monotherapy demonstrated that marrow cellularity less
than 20% and blast proportion less than 5% were asso￾ciated with a higher likelihood of transfusion indepen￾dence and improved survival after immunosuppressive
therapy38. In this multicenter series, information about
mutations that might predict response to IST such as
BCOR was not consistently available, but the presence of
a paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) clone or
HLA DR15 status, which had been found to be of value in
predicting response in smaller (mostly single-center)
series, did not predict IST response. A trial of IST is
reasonable in a lower risk patient who lacks excess blasts
or a complex karyotype and who either has (1) anemia
that has not responded to ESA or lenalidomide, or has (2)
another severe cytopenia that either has not responded to
growth factors or where the clinician elects not to use
growth factors or the patient’s insurance will not pay for
growth factors. IST is a particularly attractive considera￾tion if the marrow is hypocellular for age.
Recently, results were reported from a multicenter
adaptive randomization clinical trial of a reduced schedule
HMA (i.e., three days of azacitidine 75 mg/m2/d per
month, or three days of decitabine 20 mg/m2/d per
month) in lower risk MDS and MDS/MPN39. The overall
response rate in this series was higher with decitabine
(32% transfusion independence rate and 70% overall
response rate) than with azacitidine (16% transfusion
independence rate and 49% overall response rate), so the
adaptive randomization resulted in 65% of enrolled
patients being treated with decitabine compared to 35%
with azacitidine. It is possible that three days of azaciti￾dine represents underdosing even in lower risk patients
and a randomized trial (NCT02269280) comparing five
days of azacitidine to three days of decitabine or a
Steensma Blood Cancer Journal (2018) 8:47 Page 3 of 7
Blood Cancer Journal

supportive care strategy is ongoing. The optimal dose and
schedule of HMA in both higher risk and lower risk MDS
is unknown, and the doses and schedules of decitabine
and azacitidine used for patients with higher risk MDS are
myelosuppressive and may have a less favorable risk￾benefit balance for those patients with lower risk MDS. Of
note, this trial of ‘lower risk’ patients enrolled 18%
patients with t-MDS and 19% with MDS/MPN overlap
syndromes, who should not be considered lower risk.
Clinical experience has shown that patients who fail to
respond to HMA rarely respond to IST, so IST after HMA
is unlikely to be of value.
Luspatercept is a fusion protein that binds to ligands of
the activin II receptor, altering transforming growth factor
beta signaling and resulting in improved erythropoiesis in
some patients with lower risk MDS40. A randomized trial
of luspatercept versus placebo in patients with MDS and
ring sideroblasts (MEDALIST; NCT02631070) completed
accrual in 2017; if this trial is positive, it is likely that
luspatercept will be the next drug FDA approved for
MDS, and would be useful in lower risk patients with
anemia and ring sideroblasts. Luspatercept has not yet
been well studied in patients without ring sideroblasts.
Higher risk MDS
For patients with higher risk MDS, the first question
that must be answered is whether the patient is a
candidate for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell trans￾plantation (ASCT). Two mathematical modeling analyses
based on Center for International Blood and Marrow
Transplant Research (CIBMTR) data—one analysis
focused on conventional myeloablative transplant, the
other inclusive of patients aged 60–70 years treated with a
reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) approaches—show
that life expectancy is improved by early transplant in this
subgroup, if feasible41,42. Increased availability of alternate
donors, including haploidentical donors and cord blood,
mean that larger proportion of patients have the oppor￾tunity to undergo SCT. Patients up to age 75 routinely
undergo transplant now, and in the future age may not be
a limitation to ASCT if performance status remains
excellent.
While details about conditioning regimens for ASCT,
graft-versus-host prophylaxis and management, and post￾transplant infectious disease prophylaxis and pre-emptive
management are beyond the scope of this review, a recent
CIBMTR/Clinical Trials Network randomized trial of RIC
compared with myeloablative conditioning (MAC) is
worth noting43. This study enrolled patients aged 18–65
years with a low transplant comorbidity index and <5%
marrow blasts, and randomly assigned them to receive
MAC (n = 135) or RIC (n = 137) followed by ASCT from
HLA-matched related or unrelated donors. While overall
survival at 18 months was slightly higher with MAC, this
Fig. 1 MDS treatment algorithm as described in the text. Clinical trials should be considered for all patients, but is recognized that many patients
will not have access to trials or will not be eligible for available trials or will not want to go on trials, especially those requiring travel to a major center.
In fact only a very small proportion of patients with MDS are currently enrolled on prospective interventional trials. However, increased trial
enrollment is an important goal given the continued poor outcomes with MDS. EPO erythropoietin, ESA erythropoiesis-stimulating agent, HMA DNA
hypomethylating agent, IST immunosuppressive therapy (anti-thymocyte globulin, cyclosporine, or tacrolimus)

Blood Cancer Journal

difference was not statistically significant. RIC resulted in
lower treatment-related mortality but at the cost of higher
relapse rates compared with MAC. These data support
the use of MAC as the standard of care for patients with
MDS who are able to tolerate more intense conditioning.
It is not clear whether treatment of higher risk MDS
prior to ASCT is beneficial, but pre-transplant bridging
therapy is often considered to cytoreduce disease, espe￾cially for those patients who are going to go on to get RIC
approaches and those who have more than 10% marrow
blasts44. Pre-transplant cytoreductive therapy can also be
considered in those for whom there will be a delay in
transplant due to lack of donor availability or insurance
approval. In the past, intensive AML-type induction
chemotherapy was commonly used for pre-transplant
cytoreduction in MDS, but today HMA therapy is used far
more frequently and outcomes are at least as good with
HMA as with intensive chemotherapy45.
For those patients who are not transplant candidates,
HMA therapy is most appropriate. In a randomized trial of
358 higher risk MDS patients, azacitidine treatment was
associated with a median survival of 24 months compared
to 15 months in patients treated with intensive che￾motherapy, low-dose cytarabine, or best supportive care46.
A similar survival improvement has not been seen in
decitabine randomized studies, but these trials enrolled a
higher risk subgroup of patients and treated patients for a
shorter period of time, so that the trials are not compar￾able to the azacitidine study. These agents are considered
comparable by most clinicians, with treatment choice left
up to individual providers based on considerations such as
regional licensing of drug or local cost considerations.
Some studies of ‘real world’ experience with azacitidine
have not been able to replicate the survival outcomes seen
in the randomized trial, so the actual benefits of HMA may
be less than has been commonly presented47.
The optimal dose and schedule for each HMA is
unclear; the best studied schedule of azacitidine is 75 mg/
m2 per day for seven days every 28 days, whereas the most
commonly used decitabine schedule for higher risk MDS
is 20 mg/m2 per day for five days every 28 days, which
avoids weekend dosing48–50. Lower doses have been stu￾died in MDS but are not approved from a regulatory
standpoint, and it is unclear if response rates mirror that
seen with the most widely studied regimens. Recently, a
very high response rate was reported with 10-day deci￾tabine treatment in patients with higher risk MDS or
AML associated with a TP53 mutation51. It is not clear,
however, if 5-day decitabine or azacitidine would be as
effective as 10 day decitabine, and 10 day decitabine is
highly myelosuppressive with a high frequency of
opportunistic infections.
HMA can decrease clonal burden and may therefore
result in improved hematopoiesis, but do not eradicate
transformed stem cells, so relapse is inevitable. The
mechanism of action of HMA is unclear, and may result
from a combination of conventional cytotoxic, DNA
hypomethylation (no specific signature), and immune￾related mechanisms including changes in interferon sig￾naling and presentation of neoantigens as epitopes to the
immune system52,53. This has led to difficulty in predict￾ing responders, and available molecular genetic assays do
not differentiate responders versus non-responders to an
extent that influences treatment selection.
Once an HMA fails the patient, either via intolerance,
resistance, or relapse after favorable response, there is no
approved second-line therapy and the outlook is poor
with a median survival of less than six months54–56.
Addition of the bcl-2 inhibitor venetoclax (an off-label
use) can recapture response and a subset of patients for
whom HMA alone is inadequate, and ongoing trials are
evaluating venetoclax both after HMA failure
(NCT02966782) and in treatment-naïve patients
(NCT02942290)57. The immune checkpoint (PD1, PDL1,
CTLA4) inhibitors, despite their high rate of efficacy in
certain solid tumors, are of limited use as monotherapy in
MDS, but are being evaluated in more than 10 different
trials as combination therapy with HMA58. Other com￾bination approaches including lenalidomide plus azaciti￾dine and histone deacetylase inhibitors plus HMA have
not resulted in improved outcomes compared to HMA
alone despite in vitro synergy, largely due to excess
myelosuppression and early treatment withdrawal59–62. In
January 2018, it was announced that the ongoing INSPIRE
trial of the multikinase inhibitor rigosertib versus best
supportive care in IPSS-R high and very high risk patients
after HMA failure (NCT02562443) would increase its
accrual goal because of promising early results. If the
results are favorable, rigosertib would be the first drug
approved for second-line therapy in MDS.
Supportive care
Support of patients with severe symptomatic anemia
with red cell transfusions and severe thrombocytopenia
with platelet transfusions is a mainstay of therapy for
MDS. Fevers in patients with MDS must be taken ser￾iously, and antimicrobial protocols for febrile neutropenia
followed carefully, as infection is the leading cause of
death in MDS63,64. The benefit of prophylactic anti￾microbials is controversial.
For patients with thrombocytopenia who are refractory to
platelet transfusions, the TPO agonists mentioned above
may be of help, and the antifibrinolytic agents epsilon￾aminocaproic acid or tranexamic acid can reduce bleeding
in some of those with recurrent mucosal hemorrhage65.
Androgens such as danazol or oxymetholone may improve
hemoglobin or platelet count in a minority of patients, but
liver tests must be monitored during therapy and some
Steensma Blood Cancer Journal (2018) 8:47 Page 5 of 7

older men may have difficulty with urinary retention due to
an increase in prostate hyperplasia66.
Patients who receive repeated transfusions with red cells
may accumulate excess iron, which can cause tissue injury
via generation of reactive free radicals. Iron chelation
therapy with deferasirox or deferoxamine may be helpful
in selected cases, but the effect of chelation on outcomes is
controversial and such therapy is expensive (deferasirox)
or inconvenient (deferoxamine)67. A randomized trial of
deferasirox versus placebo in lower risk MDS patients with
red cell transfusion dependence and a serum ferritin
greater than 1000 ng/mL (TELESTO; NCT00940602) has
completed accrual and results are eagerly awaited.
Future directions
Dozens of novel agents are in development for MDS, as
recently reviewed by Brunner and Steensma68. These
include luspatercept, rigosertib, immune checkpoint
inhibitors, and venetoclax, as mentioned above. In addi￾tion, three new HMAs are in late phase clinical trials:
guadecitabine (a parenterally administered dinucleotide
nucleoside analog formerly known as SGI-110), CC486
(an orally bioavailable form of azacitidine), and cedazurine
(formerly known as ASTX727, an orally administered
fixed-dose combination of decitabine and a cytidine dea￾minase inhibitor). The oral HMAs may allow exploration
of extended doses and schedules compared to the avail￾able parenteral agents. Some patients who were failed by
available HMAs responded to guadecitabine; a phase
3 study is ongoing in relapsed/refractory disease
(NCT02907359)69. Imetelstat, a telomerase inhibitor also
being studied in myeloproliferative neoplasms, is in a
Phase 2 trial (NCT02598661) and transfusion indepen￾dence rates were ~30% in the first phase of this study70. A
major priority is restoration of TP53 activity given the
poor prognosis of patients with mutant or deleted TP53,
and trials (NCT03072043) are ongoing with APR-246, a
TP53 modulator, and other agents in this subgroup.
Conclusion
Treatment of patients with MDS requires appropriate
risk stratification and a tailored approach that depends on
the specific pattern and degree of cytopenias, sEPO level,
presence of del(5q), marrow cellularity, and age and
comorbid conditions. New approaches are needed, as the
majority of patients diagnosed with MDS in 2018 will die
of complications of cytopenias64.
