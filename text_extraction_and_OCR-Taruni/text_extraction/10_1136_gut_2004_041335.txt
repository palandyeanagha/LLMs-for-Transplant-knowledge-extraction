Background: Many determinants for a sustained response to lamivudine therapy have been reported but
the role of T cell responsiveness remains unclear. The finding that tyrosine-methionine-aspartate-aspartate
(YMDD) motif of the reverse transcriptase domain of hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA polymerase carries a
HLA-A2 restricted cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) epitope makes quantitative measurement of the numbers of
peptide specific CTLs feasible using MHC tetramer-peptide complex staining.
Aim: To investigate the correlation between anti-YMDD motif CTL activity and the efficacy of lamivudine
therapy in HLA-A2 positive patients with chronic hepatitis B (CH-B).
Methods: The function and phenotype of peptide and interleukin 2 expanded peripheral blood
mononuclear cells were quantified by cell lytic assay and immunocytochemical analysis by staining with
HLA-A2-peptide tetramer complexes.
Results: After in vitro expansion, sustained responders had more potent CTL responses against YMDD,
YVDD, and YIDD, as well as other epitopes on HBV antigens than non-responders. The frequency of
YMDD/YVDD/YIDD motif specific CTLs increased significantly with an effective cell lytic function during
and after therapy in sustained responders but not in non-responders. YMDD specific CTLs cross reacted
with YIDD and YVDD mutant epitopes, and shared T cell receptor gene usages with YIDD and YVDD
specific CTLs.
Conclusions: Sustained responders, at least HLA-A2 patients, elicited a more potent CTL immunity against
YMDD and its mutants. YMDD specific CTLs are cross reactive with YVDD and YIDD mutant epitopes,
which may further contribute to immune clearance of the mutant viruses and a successful response to
lamivudine therapy in CH-B patients.
L
amivudine, (-)-29, 39-dideoxy-39-thiacytidine (3TC), has
become the main therapeutic option for treating hepatitis
B virus (HBV) infection.1–5 Its antiviral effects against
HBV have been established both in vitro and in vivo.6–8
Results from clinical trials revealed that lamivudine is
effective in reducing HBV replication and preventing the
progression of chronic liver disease.4 5 9 10 Complete suppres￾sion of viral replication, as determined by negativity for
serum HBV DNA, may be achieved in most patients; however,
clearance of hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) with antibody
(anti-HBe) seroconversion was seen in only a minority of
patients.135 In Asian patients, HBeAg seroconversion with
loss of HBV DNA after lamivudine therapy occurred in 16%,
27%, 40%, and 47% of patients after 1, 2, 3, and 4 years of
treatment, respectively.1 4 9 10 Resistance to lamivudine ther￾apy also increased in frequency with continuation of therapy,
with rates being estimated as 17%, 40%, 55%, and 67% after
1, 2, 3, and 4 years of therapy, respectively.10
The genome of the lamivudine resistant virus has been
mapped to mutations in the tyrosine-methionine-aspartate￾aspartate (YMDD) motif of the reverse transcriptase (rt)
domain of HBV DNA polymerase. Specifically, methionine
552 was mutated to isoleucine or valine (rtM552I/V) in
patients with rebound viraemia.11 12 The appearance of
lamivudine resistant HBV is a major clinical concern as it
has been associated with a decreased rate of HBeAg
seroconversion and deterioration of liver histology as well
as clinical outcome.13–15 Mutations in the sequence of highly
conserved YMDD motif, such as YIDD and YVDD, may also
develop during lamivudine therapy in both immunocompe￾tent hosts and immunosuppressed patients after liver
transplantation.11 16 17 Moreover, lamivudine is an rt inhibi￾tor,2 18 which has little effect on the episomal template of
HBV (that is, closed circular DNA), a source of viral
replication. The mechanism of successful lamivudine therapy
therefore remains to be elucidated.2 19 Several parameters
such as patients with genotype B, age less than 36 years, and
additional lamivudine treatment over eight months have
been shown to be the major determinants for a sustained
response to lamivudine therapy20; however, the role of
cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses has yet to be
determined. Rehermann and colleagues21 have shown that
the nonapeptide YMDDVVLGA (amino acid residues 551–
559) on the YMDD motif, superimposing with the catalytic

site of the HBV DNA polymerase,2 is a HLA-A2 restricted CTL
epitope. Quantitative measurement of the numbers of peptide
specific CTLs is thus feasible by staining MHC tetramer￾peptide complexes in HLA-A2 positive patients with chronic
hepatitis B (CH-B). We therefore employed both phenotypic
and functional immunological assays to assess the correlation
between anti-YMDD motif CTL activity and the efficacy of
lamivudine therapy in HLA-A2 patients with CH-B.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study subjects
Fourteen HLA-A2 (+) adults with CH-B (table 1) were
enrolled in the present study and were evaluated from July
1999 to July 2001. Eleven non-HLA-A2 patients (data not
shown) were also studied as control patients during the same
period. Before lamivudine treatment, all patients met the
following criteria: presence of hepatitis B surface antigen
(HBsAg) and HBeAg in serum for at least six months; raised
serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels; liver biopsy
taken within three months of enrolment showing CH-B with
hepatocyte expression of hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAg);
seropositivity for HBV DNA (Digene HBV Test, Hybrid
Capture II; Digene Corp., Maryland, USA) on at least two
occasions one month apart before entry; and undetectable
YMDD mutants in serum by amplification created restriction
site (ACRS) analysis, as described previously.14 The sensitivity
of ACRS in detecting YMDD mutants approximates 1% of the
viral population. Concurrent hepatitis C virus (HCV) or
hepatitis delta virus (HDV) infections were excluded, and
none had human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.
HBsAg, anti-HBs, total and IgM anti-HBc, HBeAg, anti-HBe,
anti-HDV, anti-HCV, anti-HIV-1, and anti-HIV-2 were
determined by commercially available ELISA kits (Abbott
Laboratories, North Chicago, Illinois, USA; Ortho Diagnostic
Systems, Raritan, New Jersey, USA; Sanofi Diagnostic
Pasteur, Marnes-la Coquette, France).
Oral lamivudine (Zeffix; GlaxoWellcome, Greenford, UK)
100 mg per day was administered for more than nine
months. Complete response (CR) to treatment was defined
as sustained HBeAg seroconversion to anti-HBe in associa￾tion with disappearance of serum HBV DNA and normal￾isation of serum ALT levels for at least 12 months after
cessation of treatment. Cases with transient normalisation of
serum ALT levels followed by a relapse either within
12 months after cessation or during lamivudine therapy
were defined as partial responders (PR). Non-response (NR)
was defined as lack of either a biochemical or virological
response to therapy. Routine follow up studies included
clinical assessment, conventional liver biochemical tests, and
serological markers of hepatitis viruses. All patients were
followed for more 12 months after the end of lamivudine
therapy and completion of immunological assays.
Immunological assessments, including modified CTL
response index of the peptide (CRI-p) culture, fluorescence
activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis, tetramer staining and
cell sorting, T cell receptor (TCR) gene analysis, and CTL
killing assays were performed in consecutive patients on a
volunteer basis because these experiments needed extensive
blood sampling. HLA typing was performed using standard
serological techniques (Terasaki HLA Tissue Typing Trays;
One Lambda, Inc., Canoga Park, California, USA). Those with
the HLA-A2 haplotype were subsequently confirmed to have
HLA-A2.1 allele by DNA typing (Micro-SSP, HLA DNA Typing
Trays, One Lambda). Patients other than HLA-A2 were also
included as mutual controls to ensure the specificity of the
tetramer assay and peptide specific CTL assay. Immunological

studies were assessed before lamivudine therapy (prether￾apy) and after three months of treatment.
Synthetic peptides for T-cell analysis and synthesis of
HLA-A2-peptide tetrameric complexes
A total of 15 HLA-A2 restricted epitope peptides on HBV
antigens (table 2) were used for the immunological studies.21–23
Peptides including: (a) HBcAg 18–27, FLPSDFFPSV; (b)
wild-type YMDD motif nonapeptide YMDDVVLGA and its
mutants; (c)YVDD peptide YVDDVVLGA; and (d) YIDD
peptide YIDDVVLGA were also used to construct HLA-A2-
peptide tetrameric complexes using a method described
previously.24
Modified CRI-p method
As reported previously, the frequencies of tetramer staining
CD8+ T cells in fresh peripheral blood mononuclear cells
(PBMCs) are usually below 1% in freshly isolated PBMCs
from the peripheral blood of both patients with hepatitis B25–27
and hepatitis C.28–31 To overcome this, the modified CRI-p
method (fig 1), which can provide adequate cell numbers for
FACS analysis in one experiment from single blood sampling,
was adopted for semi quantitative determination of the
relative strength of CTL activity against a panel of peptides.
Briefly, freshly isolated PBMCs were plated in triplicate on six
well plates (56106
/well) and cultured with 20 U/ml inter￾leukin 2 (IL-2) and 1 mg/ml designated peptides. Fresh IL-2
was replaced every other day, and after 14 days of expansion,
cell numbers could increase by 10–20-fold. The expanded
cells were subjected to tetramer staining and functional
assays.
Cell lytic capacity of peptide and IL-2 expanded
PBMCs
Cytotoxicity assays were performed by coculturing effectors
and target cells at ratios ranging from 10:1 to 40:1 in the non￾radioactive enzyme immunoassay system CytoTox 96
(Promega, Madison, Wisconsin, USA) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. In the experiments to test the
cross reactivity of YMDD specific CTLs against other peptides,
the E/T ratio was 20:1 to 5:1. Two types of effectors were
used: one was the peptide specific cells expanded by the
CRI-p method and the other was CD8+ T cells positively
sorted from the peptide and IL-2 expanded population by the
CRI-p method. Target cells included the HLA-A2 positive
Epstein-Barr virus transformed B cell line (B-LCL) infected
by HBV or exogenously pulsed with a panel of peptides. For
HBV infection, B-LCL cells were transfected with the Simian
virus 40 derived plasmid pSV2A-Neo-(HBV)2 (a kind gift of
Dr J-H Ou, University of Southern California, Los Angeles,
California, USA) and selected with the neomycin analogue
G418 by procedures described previously.32 33 B-LCL cells
transfected with pSV2A-Neo-(HBV)2 that could express all
the HBV antigen proteins, including HBsAg, HBeAg, and
HBcAg, were designated as HBV transfected B-LCL cells. HBV
transfected B-LCL cells were used to serve as target cells for

(CRI-p) culture method. On the first day of blood sampling, 56106
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in complete medium in
triplicate cultures in a six well flat bottomed plate (Nunc, Roskilde,
Denmark) with a mixture of the panel of peptides to be tested (each
1 mg/ml), 1 mg/ml recombinant hepatitis B core antigen (rHBcAg)32,
and 20 U/ml recombinant human interleukin 2 (rhIL-2) were incubated
at 37˚C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. On days 3, 5, 7, 9,11, and
13, the culture medium was refreshed with 20 U/ml of rhIL-2. Usually,
the total number of cells could proliferate up to 3,56107 cells on day
13, and sometimes to 108 cells by day 14. Cells harvested on days 14–
15 were used for cell lytic assays and phenotypic study, with surface

assessment of CTL recognition of endogenously presented
HBV antigens. Mock transfected B-LCL cells were used as
controls. In separate experiments, B-LCL cells exogenously
pulsed with designated peptides of 1 mg/ml overnight were
also used as target cells. Results were calculated as per cent
specific cytotoxicity = (experimental release 2 effector
spontaneous release 2 target spontaneous release) / (target
maximum release 2 target spontaneous release) 6100%.
Data for cell lytic analysis were expressed as modified CRI-p
( = mean of the per cent specific cytotoxicity of each of the
triplicate cultures) and total modified CRI-p value ( = sum of
all modified CRI-p of the tested panel of peptides).
Cell lytic activity of FACS sorted peptide specific CD8 T
cells
Peptide specific CD8+ T cells were positively sorted from the
cell population after peptide and IL-2 expansion in the
modified CRI-p method. Cell lytic assays of these CTLs were
performed as described above. However, because the number
of sorted peptide specific CTLs was limited from single CRI-p
culture, CTLs isolated and expanded from different CR
patients were used for the assay against HBV infected targets
or against cells pulsed with indicated epitope peptides. For
example, YMDD specific CTLs sorted from patient No 3 were
cocultured with B-LCL target cells transfected with HBV or
pulsed with YMDD (see fig 3A). Likewise, YVDD specific CTLs
from patient No 8 were assayed against B-LCL targets
transfected with HBV or pulsed with YVDD (see fig 3B);
YIDD specific CTLs from patient No 2 were cocultured with B￾LCL targets transfected with HBV or pulsed with YIDD (see
fig 3C); HBcAg (18–27) specific CTLs from patient No 9 were
assayed against B-LCL targets transfected with HBV or pulsed
with HBcAg(18–27) (see fig 3D); and HBcAg(18–27) specific
CTL cells from patient No 14 were tested against non-HLA￾A2(+) targets transfected with HBV or pulsed with
HBcAg(18–27) peptide (see fig 3E).

various peptide epitopes of wild-type hepatitis B virus (HBV) antigens three months after treatment. Patient No 3 elicited more vigorous anti-YMDD motif
killing activity than patient No 4. The broken line set at 30% is the mean level (+3 SD) of the 11 non-HLA-A2 patients. Levels above this value were
considered positive responses. (C) Phenotypic assay of peptide specific CD8 T cells. Representative fluorescence activated cell sorter analysis of tetramer

patient No 4, patient No 3 showed significantly higher percentages of tetramer staining for YMDD, YVDD, and YIDD as well as for HBV core 18–27
tetramers. (D) Frequencies of peptide specific CD8 T cells were higher in patients with CR than in those with NR/PR. Data for the frequencies of peptide
specific CD8 T cells were pooled and compared between patients with CR (seven patients) and those with NR/PR (seven patients) (see table 1) using the

FACS analysis
For FACS analysis of peptide specific CD8+ T cells, cells
cultured after expansion by the modified CRI-p method were
processed on a Beckman Coulter EPICS Altra Hypersort
System (Beckman Coulter, Inc., California, USA) and
analysed by EXPO2 software (Beckman Coulter). The
specificity of tetramers was confirmed using the method
previously described.24 28

by the modified CTL response index of the peptide (CRI-p) method were cocultured with hepatitis B virus (HBV) infected or peptide pulsed B-LCL target
cells. CTLs including YMDD, YIDD, and YIDD tetramer stained CD8+ T cells sorted by fluorescence activated cell sorter analysis from different complete
response patients were used as effector cells (see materials and methods) with three different effector/target cell ratios (E/T ratio = 40, 20, and 10).
Target cells were either peptide pulsed, HBV transfected, or mock transfected B-LCL cells.

previously,34 35 with 59 and 39 actin primers as internal
controls.34 The authenticity of TCR primers was verified by
examining TCR AV and BV expression on PBMCs stimulated
with 1 mg/ml phytohaemagglutinin (PHA; Sigma, St Louis,
Missouri, USA) for 72 hours. To evaluate junctional region
sequences, PCR products were separated by electrophoresis
on a 1.8% agarose gel, and DNA was purified and cloned into
pT7 Blue T-Vector (Novagen, Madison, Wisconsin, USA).
DNA sequences of at least three independent clones were
obtained per PCR product from each cell fraction, and were
sequenced using CEQ2000 DNA Analysis System (Beckman
Coulter, Inc.). TCR gene usages of tetramer staining cells
were assigned according to those previously described.36 37
Medium for cell culture
Culture medium used in this study was RPMI 1640
supplemented with 5% heat inactivated human AB serum,
25 mM HEPES, 2 mM L-glutamine, 1% sodium pyruvate,
0.05 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, and antibiotics. All were
purchased from Gibco Laboratories (Grand Island, New
York, USA).
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was carried out with the SPSS for
Windows, version 10.0. (SPSS Inc., Chicago, Illinois, USA).
The Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare unpaired
data. Differences with a p value less than 0.05 were
considered statistically significant.
RESULTS
Lamivudine responders showed a higher YMDD,
YVDD, and YIDD specific CTL frequency and
cytotoxicity activity after in vitro expansion
In total, seven CR, two PR, and five NR patients were enrolled
and studied, among whom the frequency of the tetramer(+)
CD8 T cells was determined in four CR, two PR, and two NR
patients at both pretherapy and three months after treatment
(table 1). As shown in fig 2A, the frequency of the
tetramer(+) CD8 T cells was higher in the four CR patients
than in the four PR+NR patients, both before initiation of
therapy and three months after treatment. In the cytotoxicity
assay of the cells expanded by the CRI-p method determined
at three months after treatment, both lamivudine responders
(for example, patient No 3) and non-responders (for
example, patient 4) showed polyclonal cell lytic capacity to
epitopes of different wild-type HBV antigens (fig 2B). The per
cent specific cytotoxicity elicited by YMDD peptide and its
mutants YVDD and YIDD was also higher in complete
responders than in non-responders (fig 2B, columns 13–
15). Furthermore, the frequencies of these peptide specific
cells contained within the HLA-A2-tetramer-peptide (+) CD8
T cell population after in vitro expansion, as visualised by the
phenotypic assay, were higher in CR (for example, patient No
3) than in NR (for example, patient No 4) patients (fig 2C)
three months after treatment. There were only two PR
patients in this series, which did not allow their T cell
immunity to be analysed significantly. Nevertheless, when
data from NR and PR patients were pooled together and
compared with those of CR, the percentages of YMDD, YVDD,
and YIDD tetramer staining CD8+ T cells after peptide/IL-2
expansion were significantly higher in the seven CR cases
than in the five NR and two PR patients three months after
lamivudine therapy (fig 2D, table 1).
Enriched peptide specific CTLs from complete
responders had effective capacities in killing of target
cells
To examine the functional activity of peptide specific CD8+ T
cells, the peptide expanded population by the CRI-p method
were positively sorted by FACS and cocultured with target
cells, including HBV transfected B-LCL cells and B-LCL cells
pulsed with 1 mg/ml of the corresponding peptides. Pulsing
the target cells with a higher dose of peptides (for example, 4
and 2 mg/ml) resulted in a higher percentage of killing (data
not shown). However, as 1 mg/ml was used to expand the
peptide specific T cells in the modified CRI-p method, this
concentration was used throughout all the cell lytic experi￾ments. Results revealed that YMDD specific CD8+ T cells

expanded and enriched by the CRI-p method from CR
patients had effective capacities in killing the target cells
endogenously expressing HBV antigens or exogenously
pulsed with YMDD (fig 3A). Similar results were also noted
for YVDD, YIDD, and HBcAg (18–27) specific CTLs (fig 3B–
D), indicating that these peptide specific CTLs are not only
present in the peripheral blood of CR patients but are also
able to kill HBV infected cells or any cells expressing relevant
peptides in vitro.
YMDD specific CTLs cross reacted with YIDD and YVDD
To determine if YMDD specific CTLs recognised their
mutants, peptide/IL-2 expanded YMDD cells were positively
sorted from patient No 3 and used as effector cells in
coculture with HBV infected B-LCL or B-LCL cells pulsed
separately with YIDD, YVDD, and HBcAg (18–27) peptides.
As shown in fig 4, YMDD specific CD8+ cells could also kill
B-LCL cells pulsed with YVDD or YIDD peptide as efficiently
as those pulsed with YMDD peptide (approximately 35–40%
of specific target cell lysis at an E/T ratio of 20). No cross
reactivity was noted against HBcAg (18–27) peptide (fig 4A,
B, C v D).
YMDD specific T cells shared usages of TCR AV and BV
genes with YVDD and YIDD specific T cells
The primers of 19 Va and 21 Vb families used to amplify TCR
AV and BV genes were verified in PHA stimulated PBMCs in
both ethidium bromide staining (fig 5A) and autoradiogra￾phy film (fig 5B). The Vb 20 was very faint in the ethidium
bromide staining gel but it could be clearly demonstrated on
the autoradiography film. Results of TCR gene usage analysis
of patient No 3 revealed that YMDD tetramer staining CD8+ T
cells shared AV12S1 and BV13S1 in TCR AV and BV gene
usages, respectively, with YVDD and YIDD tetramer staining
CD8+T cells but not with HBV core 18–27 tetramer staining
CD8+T cells in which AV7S2 and BV17S1A1T were used,
respectively (fig 6). Consistent results were also noted in
patient Nos 2, 5, 9, and 10 with CR to lamivudine therapy
(that is, all YMDD specific CTLs shared TCR AV and BV gene
usages with YIDD and YVDD specific CTLs but not with
HBcAg 18–27 specific CTLs; data not shown). These results
together with data from CTL assays (that is, figs 3, 4) further
confirmed that the anti-YMDD CTL response was cross
reactive against YVDD and YIDD.
Frequency of A2 tetramer (+) anti-(YIDD+ YVDD) CD8+
T cells after in vitro expansion is higher than YMDD
and HBcAg(18-27) specific CD8+ T cells after
lamivudine therapy in CR patients
When assayed three months after treatment, the frequency of
anti-mutant (YIDD+YVDD) CD8+ T cells in patient No 2 (CR
to treatment) was higher than that of YMDD and HBV core
(18–27) tetramer (+) CD8 T cells after in vitro expansion
(fig 7A). Such results were also noted in most other CR
patients, such as patient No 3, 5, 8, 9, 10, and 14 (table 1).
Overall, these CR patients had 2–3-fold higher numbers of
mutant (YVDD+YIDD) specific CD8+ T cells than those of
YMDD specific CD8+ T cells (fig 7B).
DISCUSSION
It has been reported that lamivudine can restore T cell
responsiveness to several different CTL and T helper cell
epitopes.22 38 We have also demonstrated that activation of
Th1 immunity is a common immune mechanism for the
successful treatment of HBV and HCV infections.28 The
results from the present study have shown that in patients
who had T cell immunity analysed after in vitro expansion
both before and after lamivudine treatment (that is, four CR
and four PR+NR cases), CR patients had a higher frequency
of tetramer staining CD8+ T cells than non-CR (PR+NR)
patients (table 1, fig 2A), including YMDD, YVDD, YIDD, and
HBcAg(18-27) specific CD8 T cells. When assayed three
months post therapy, all seven CR patients consistently had
polyclonal activation of anti-wild-type HBV immune
responses, including HBcAg 18–27, manifested by the
simultaneous increase in the per cent specific cytotoxicity
of peptide expanded cells against different wild-type HBV
specific peptide epitopes (fig 2B). These seven CR patients
also exhibited significantly higher anti-YMDD and anti￾mutant (-YVDD and -YIDD) cell lytic capacity compared with
that of non-responders or partial responders (fig 2B, table 1).
Peptide/IL-2 expanded YMDD and mutant specific CD8+ T
cells also had detectable killing ability (fig 3). In agreement
with the functional assay, the phenotypic studies assayed

three months after treatment also revealed that the frequen￾cies of CTLs specific for YMDD, YIDD, and YVDD correlated
with treatment outcome (fig 2C, D, table 1). Clinical
observations have shown that in one-fifth to half of patients
who responded initially to lamivudine monotherapy, the
response was not sustained on lamivudine withdrawal. Risk
factors associated with this low sustainability include low
pretreatment levels of serum ALT and lack of additional use
of interferon,20 39 suggesting that there is an inadequate HBV
specific immune response at the end of therapy. Moreover,
lamivudine resistant mutation has frequently been detected
after long term therapy which has been regarded as one of
the major causes for treatment failure.14 Our present study
suggests that in addition to wild-type HBV specific antigens,
generation of effective CTLs against YMDD and its mutants
correlates with the clinical results, implying that these anti￾mutant CTLs may also contribute to clearance of emerging
mutant viruses and successful response to lamivudine
treatment.
In the crossover experiments, anti-YMDD CTLs also
recognised and lysed target cells coated with YVDD and
YIDD peptides (fig 4). Moreover, they shared TCR gene
usages with YVDD and YIDD specific CTLs (fig 6), indicating
that these cells might be derived from the same CTL
precursors with a different capacity in binding the MHC￾A2-peptide complexes. The mechanism for such ‘‘cross
recognition’’ is unclear. It has been shown that in patients
with acute HBV infection, MHC binding supermotif derived
peptides may predict broadly cross reactive CTL responses.40
In animal models, amino acid replacement in the second
MHC-A2 binding position of peptide may also enhance in
vitro potency and in vivo immunogenicity of a CTL epitope
from HCV core protein in transgenic A2Kb mice.41 Indeed, the
lamivudine associated mutation of the polymerase 551–559
epitope is located at position 552 of the peptide, which
corresponds to position 2 of the MHC-A2 peptide epitope, a
position important for anchoring to MHC class I molecules
but not for T cell interaction. Therefore, cross recognition of
YMDD specific T cells against YVDD and YIDD is not totally
unexpected. Nevertheless, our data confirmed that apart
from acute infection, cross reactivity of YMDD specific CTLs
against its mutants is also present in patients with CH-B
infection. It is likely that in patients with a CR, substitution
of different amino acids at position 2 of YMDD (for example,
YIDD and YVDD) actually enhances peptide binding affinity
on MHC class I molecules, which subsequently increases the
efficacy of antigen presentation without reducing TCR
recognition capacity.
The reason for the lack of response in our NR patients is
not immediately clear. Lamivudine requires intracellular
metabolism to its active form, 59-triphosphate, 3TC-59-
triphosphate (3TCTP), to inhibit the replication of HBV
DNA.42 Further studies are needed to determine whether NR
patients are unable to phosphorylate lamivudine. However,
amino acid substitutions within a defined epitope may also
result in reducing or eliminating, instead of augmenting,
MHC class I binding and/or failed recognition by antiviral
CTLs, as has been noted in selected patients with HBV43 and
HCV44 infection. It is therefore likely that the unsatisfactory
CTL responses to lamivudine therapy in our non-responders
or partial responders may be due to decreased, in contrast
with enhanced, peptide-MHC binding and impaired antigen
presentation of YVDD and YIDD after single nucleotide
mutation. These issues deserve further investigation.
Drug resistant mutant viruses often emerge after current
monotherapy with nucleoside analogues. By highly sensitive
diagnostic assays, rtM552I/V mutant HBV can be detected as
early as three months post therapy.45 Thus far, it is still an
issue of debate if lamivudine resistant mutants actually exist
before therapy or whether lamivudine per se enforces wild￾type virus for evolutionary mutation. Clinically, discontinua￾tion of lamivudine therapy usually results in disappearance of
rtM552I/V mutations, accompanied by an outgrowth of wild￾type HBV. Moreover, readministration of lamivudine usually
results in a prompt re-emergence of resistant strains.46 It is
thus likely that mutant viruses may well pre-exist in the
hosts prior to treatment, and administration of lamivudine
therapy rapidly suppress the wild-type HBV and selects
resistant mutants to growth. Recently, Kobayashi and
colleagues47 detected YMDD motif mutations in some
lamivudine untreated asymptomatic HBV carriers, including
mixed infections of YMDD+YIDD and YMDD+YIDD+YVDD.
Our data also showed that before initiation of lamivudine
treatment, patients with CR to treatment already had a
higher frequency of YIDD and YVDD tetramer stained CTL
cells than NR+PR patients (table 1, fig 2A) assayed after in

Figure 7 Frequency of YIDD+YVDD specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes
(CTLs) was higher than that of YMDD specific CTLs in complete response
(CR) patients. Total frequency of YMDD mutant (that is, YIDD+YVDD)
tetramer stained CD8+ T cells after expansion using the modified CTL
response index of the peptide (CRI-p) method from patient No 2 was
compared with that of YMDD specific and hepatitis B core antigen (HBc
18–27) specific CTLs (A) three months after therapy. Before therapy, the
frequency of YIDD was 2.9% (table 1) after in vitro expansion. Overall,
CR patients had a significantly higher YIDD and YVDD specific CTL
frequency than YMDD specific cells (B). ***p = 0.001, Mann-Whitney

vitro expansion, as well as relatively more potent anti-YIDD
and -YVDD CTL activity three months after therapy (table 1,
fig 7A, B). These findings further point to the likelihood that
mutant viruses may pre-exist, at least in these selected
patients, so that pre-existing memory T cells respond to
treatment and proliferate, leading to a high level of
functional anti-mutant CTL activity.
In conclusion, our data demonstrated both phenotypically
and functionally the presence of significantly more potent
YMDD specific CTLs cross recognising other mutant epitopes
in patients with CH-B infection with a complete response to
lamivudine therapy. The reason why patients with PR or NR
to therapy had a lower frequency and ineffective anti-mutant
CTL immunity is still unknown. Inability of TCR recognition
of mutant peptides, as described above, may be one of the
contributing factors. Other determinants such as HBV
genotype, inability to phosphorylate lamivudine, age of
patients, duration of treatment, and population differences
may also play a role.3 7 20 42 48–51 In our preliminary follow up
study, two of our NR patients developed dual genotype
infection (data not shown). Nevertheless, our study suggest
that in addition to those against immunogenic peptide
epitopes of wild-type HBV, activation of CTL responses to
YMDD, YVDD, and YIDD correlates with a sustained
successful response to lamivudine therapy, at least in HLA￾A2 patients. Cross reactivity of YMDD specific CTLs against
its mutants may further control the growth of mutant
viruses. Similar mechanisms may also contribute to success￾ful response in non- HLA-A2 individuals. Whether or not
YMDD specific CTLs could also recognise other newly
discovered mutants (for example, YSDD)52 that may also
result in treatment failure remains to be elucidated.

Chronic diarrhoea after allogenic bone marrow transplantation
Clinical presentation
A chronic myeloid leukaemia was diagnosed in a 25 year old
woman, and nine months later she developed an acute
transformation. After conditioning chemotherapy without
total body irradiation, she received an allogenic bone marrow
transplantation (BMT). Post transplant complications
included pulmonary infections and acute graft versus host
disease (GVHD) affecting the skin (grade I) and the liver,
with a rapid response to corticosteroids and cyclosporin. In
the following year, she developed diabetes, cataract, and
femoral osteonecrosis, and the treatment was tapered.
Chronic diarrhoea progressively developed with weight loss
of 20 kg. Stool weight was of 600 g/day with steatorrhoea of
45 g/day. The D-xylose test was normal and the Schilling test
showed partial B12 malabsorption. Oesogastroduodenoscopy
with biopsies was normal. Ileocolonoscopy was macroscopi￾cally normal but biopsies of the ileum showed signs of
attenuated GVHD. A computed tomography scan of the
abdomen was performed (fig 1B) and compared with a
previous scan, performed before BMT (fig 1A).
Question
What do theses scans (fig 1A, B) show?
See page 174 for answer
