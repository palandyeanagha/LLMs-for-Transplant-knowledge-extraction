Abstract
Smoking-induced diffuse interstitial lung processes include
respiratory bronchiolitis, respiratory bronchiolitis-associated
interstitial lung disease (RBILD), desquamative interstitial
pneumonia (DIP) and Langerhans’ cell histiocytosis. The
histological, radiological and clinical features of respiratory
bronchiolitis, RBILD and DIP are reviewed, with particular
reference to management issues; Langerhans’ cell histiocytosis is
covered elsewhere in this series of articles. Possible relationships
between smoking and other diffuse lung diseases are explored
briefly.
•  BAL, bronchoalveolar lavage
•  DIP, desquamative interstitial pneumonia
•  HRCT, high resolution computed tomography
•  IPF, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis
•  NSIP, non-specific interstitial pneumonia
•  RBILD, respiratory bronchiolitis-associated interstitial lung
disease
•  Tlco, carbon monoxide transfer factor
•  UIP, usual interstitial pneumonia
