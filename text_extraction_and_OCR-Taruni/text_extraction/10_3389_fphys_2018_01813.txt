Obesity and associated comorbidities, including non-alcoholic fatty liver disease
(NAFLD), are a major concern to public well-being worldwide due to their high
prevalence among the population, and its tendency on the rise point to as important
threats in the future. Therapeutic approaches for obesity-associated disorders have
been circumscribed to lifestyle modifications and pharmacological therapies have
demonstrated limited efficacy. Over the last few years, different studies have shown
a significant role of intestinal microbiota (IM) on obesity establishment and NAFLD
development. Therefore, modulation of IM emerges as a promising therapeutic strategy
for obesity-associated diseases. Administration of prebiotic and probiotic compounds,
fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) and exercise protocols have shown a modulatory
action over the IM. In this review we provide an overview of current approaches targeting
IM which have shown their capacity to counteract NAFLD and metabolic syndrome
features in human patients and animal models.

NON-ALCOHOLIC FATTY LIVER DISEASE (NAFLD)
NAFLD has emerged as the most common chronic liver disorder in Western countries, with an
estimated prevalence of between 10 and 30% in USA and Europe and about 25% worldwide
(Younossi et al., 2015). NAFLD development is strongly associated with obesity, type II diabetes
and other features of the metabolic syndrome such as hypertension or dyslipidemia. In the case of
obesity, the link with NAFLD is especially important since 75–92% of morbidity obese individuals
present some degree of fatty liver (Fazel et al., 2016). This association implies that NAFLD will
be more common in the near future due to the global epidemic of obesity, with more than
1,900 million people being overweight and more than 600 million obese in 2014 (World Health
Organization, 2016).
Most NAFLD patients show a benign manifestation called steatosis defined as lipid
accumulation in the liver. However, the disease can progress into more severe conditions
such as non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, fibrosis, cirrhosis or even hepatocellular carcinoma
(Tiniakos et al., 2010).
The pathophysiology of NAFLD is not yet fully understood with many factors involved in
the progression of the disease. According to the multiple parallel hit hypothesis, all of them

Porras et al. Microbiota Modulation in NAFLD
can act together simultaneously (Tilg and Moschen, 2010).
Among these factors we found insulin resistance, oxidative stress,
lipid metabolism alteration, inflammatory cytokines liberation,
endoplasmic reticulum stress, intestinal dysbiosis or gut-liver axis
activation (Buzzetti et al., 2016).
INTESTINAL MICROBIOTA AND NAFLD
The intestinal microbiota (IM) is a complex ecosystem where
1014 microorganisms coexists, mainly strict anaerobe bacteria
though also facultative anaerobes, aerobes, small eukaryotes
(fungi and protozoa) and viruses. The IM bacteria comprise two
predominant bacterial phyla: Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes which
reach as much as 90% of total bacterial population, although
Proteobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, Actinobacteria, Fusobacteria,
and Cyanobacteria are also represented (Sekirov et al., 2010).
Colonization of gastrointestinal tract is believed to begin in
utero and continues after birth until the early childhood
(Francino, 2014) when the microbiome is relatively stable and
specific of each individual (Zoetendal et al., 2008). Despite
interindividual differences some authors have proposed the
concept of enterotype as a core microbiome shared among
the population, identifiable for a predominant bacterial genus:
Bacteroides in the Enterotype 1, Prevotella in the Enterotype
2 and Ruminococcus in the Enterotype 3 (Arumugam et al.,
2011). Later studies have questioned the existence of enterotypes
or suggested a different classification but this attempt toward
simplification could have an impact on clinical practice (Costea
et al., 2018).IM acts as a live organ, carrying over protective,
immune, metabolic and trophic functions (Miele et al., 2013),
including non-digestible fiber fermentation and subsequent small
chain fatty acids (SCFAs) production. The crosstalk between IM
and the immune system, enforcing the symbiotic relationship
between commensal bacteria and the host is noteworthy. This
interplay modulates both adaptive and innate response to
pathogens at the same time that prevents triggering immune
activation in the absence of potentially harmful stimuli, thus
maintaining a healthy state (Aron-Wisnewsky et al., 2013;
Belkaid and Hand, 2014). In contrast, a disturbance of IM
homeostasis with shifts in microbial composition, condition
known as dysbiosis, may result in adverse effects for the host.
Intestinal microbiota imbalance has been documented in
obese individuals (Ley et al., 2006) or with metabolic syndrome
associated diseases (Qin et al., 2012; Mouzaki et al., 2013). A
reduced proportion of Bacteroidetes and increased Firmicutes
has been indicated as a main feature of obesity-related intestinal
dysbiosis in humans (Ley et al., 2006), as well as a decrease
of total bacterial diversity and richness (Turnbaugh et al.,
2009; Le Chatelier et al., 2013). However, the statement of a
higher Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio as a hallmark of obesity
is still controversial with most of the studies sustaining that,
while others found no difference (Duncan et al., 2008) or
even support the opposite (Schwiertz et al., 2010), although
this can be attributed to methodological differences. Moreover,
several interventions to reduce body weight, including dietary
interventions as well as bariatric surgery consistently result in
lower Firmicutes or increased Bacteroidetes, although there are
still conflicting results (Seganfredo et al., 2017). Experience
with animal models could bring some light into the association
between high Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio and obesity. First
experiences with genetically obese (ob/ob) mice unveiled an
overrepresentation of Firmicutes and reduction of Bacteroidetes
(Ley et al., 2005). In nutritional models of obesity in mice using
high fat diets (HFD), increased Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio is
a common outcome (Turnbaugh et al., 2008; Hildebrandt et al.,
2009; Murphy et al., 2010) but it was suggested that this may be a
feature of the diet rather than an obesity marker (Marchesi et al.,
2016).
First studies linking NAFLD to dysbiosis reported an
increased prevalence of small intestine bacterial overgrowth
(SIBO) in NAFLD patients (Miele et al., 2013). Furthermore,
it was suggested that dysbiosis in NAFLD may be related to
different stages of the disease. In fact, dysbiosis in NASH patients
differs from that with simple steatosis or with hepatocellular
carcinoma development with a lower Bacteroidetes percentage
associated to NASH (Mouzaki et al., 2013). This is in contrast
with a later study where non-obese NAFLD patients exhibit lower
Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio than healthy controls, though this
may be attributed to cofounding effect of body mass index
(BMI). Moreover, this study reported a higher prevalence of
Gram-negative bacteria and reduced diversity at phylum level in
NAFLD patients (Wang et al., 2016).
Interestingly, ongoing down to the species level there is
evidence of specific bacteria with potential implication in
protection against obesity and NAFLD development. One
of them is the mucin degrader, Gram-negative bacteria
Akkermansia muciniphila. It was shown that A. muciniphila
positively correlates with healthier metabolic status in mice and
human studies with overweight and diabetic subjects (Dao et al.,
2016; Plovier et al., 2016). On the other hand, some bacteria could
be associated with the pathological state. Helicobacter pylori
is frequently associated with diverse gastrointestinal disorders.
Recent studies have found high prevalence of NAFLD in H.
pylori infection positive individuals, suggesting the existence of
a correlation between the presence of this bacteria and fatty liver
development (Tang and Kumar, 2017).
MECHANISMS OF
DYSBIOSIS-ASSOCIATED NAFLD
Energy Harvesting From Diet
The role of dysbiosis in obesity is based on the increased
capacity of gut microbiota from obese individuals to harvest
energy from diet (Zhu et al., 2015). Germ-free mice (GFm)-
based studies by Bäckhed et al. (2007) support this hypothesis,
with reduced body weight gain in these animals vs. conventional
raised mice following a high fat diet. Moreover, colonization
of GFm with microbiota from conventional donors leads to a
dramatic increase in body fat mass and development of insulin
resistance (Bäckhed et al., 2004). Consistently, an interesting
experiment with twins discordant for obesity resulted in greater
body and fat mass in GFm receiving microbiota of obese twins

Porras et al. Microbiota Modulation in NAFLD
(Ridaura et al., 2013). The greater efficacy on energy extraction
from food has been related to metagenome of the intestine.
Thus, microbiota of obese individuals may be enriched in
bacterial genes implicated in carbohydrate, lipid and amino￾acid metabolism (Turnbaugh et al., 2009). Genes related to
cell membrane transport, mucus degradation, and production
of toxins also seems to be overrepresented in the obese gut
microbiome (Brahe et al., 2016). This leads us to think that not
only the microbiome composition but also the microbial genome
and its function determine the obesity prone state.
The Gut-Liver Axis and the Immune System
Beyond the role of the microbiome in the onset of obesity,
mechanisms linking intestinal microbiota with NAFLD have
been extensively studied in recent years (Figure 1). Major
contribution of dysbiosis to NAFLD development takes place
through the gut-liver axis which indicated the tight anatomical
and functional relation between both organs (Vajro et al.,
2013). Gut-liver axis involves components of the intestinal
epithelium which constitutes the intestinal barrier, a tight
monolayer of differentiated cells linked by the apical junctional
complex (Catalioto et al., 2011). Compromised barrier function
of the intestine, condition known as leaky gut, is another
well documented manifestation linked to dysbiosis in NAFLD
patients (Miele et al., 2009; Giorgio et al., 2014). Leaky gut
allows translocation of potentially harmful bacterial products
to the bloodstream, reaching the liver via the portal vein.
Dysbiosis and subsequent impaired, barrier function of the
intestine leads to the increase of gut derived toxins in systemic
circulation constituting metabolic endotoxemia (Cani et al.,
2007) which, in turn, contributes to the establishment of the
chronic low grade inflammation state observed in obesity and
NAFLD (Cani et al., 2012). This inflammatory state is strongly
associated with the immune response mediated by the pattern
recognition receptors (PRRs), mainly Toll-like receptors (TLRs),
and nucleotide-binding and oligomerization domain (NOD)-like
receptors (NLRs) in response to damage-associated molecular
patterns (DAMPS) and pathogen-associated molecular patterns
(PAMPs). TLR2, TLR9, and specially TLR4 have attracted the
attention because of its well-known implication in NAFLD
pathogenesis (Arrese et al., 2016). TLR4 is the principal sensor
for lipopolysaccharide (LPS), the mayor component of the outer
membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, and it is expressed in
diverse liver cell lineages (hepatocytes and Kupffer and stellate
cells). Recognition of LPS by TLR4 triggers of an inflammatory
cascade which the last effector is the nuclear receptor kappa B
(NF-κB), releasing a wide amount of proinflammatory cytokines.
Circulating free fatty acids (FFAs) which are usually increased in
NAFLD can also induce TLR4-dependent inflammatory pathway
(Ferreira et al., 2015). Among the cytokines released, tumor
necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interleukin (IL)-6 stands out for
their contribution to insulin resistance development (Buzzetti
et al., 2016). Otherwise, NLRs respond to its ligands forming
the inflammasome complex. Most inflammasome studied in
NAFLD is NLRP3 (NOD-like receptor family, pyrin domain
containing 3), whose activation induces the recruitment of the
adapter protein ASC and procaspase-1 (Szabo and Petrasek,
2015). Maturation of procaspase-1 by autocatalysis leads to the
cleavage of proinflammatory cytokines such as pro-IL-1β or pro￾IL-18. NLRP3 expression in the liver is increased in metabolic
syndrome and NAFLD patients and its pharmacological blockade
attenuates NASH development (Mridha et al., 2017). Intriguing,
NLRP3-deficient mice present dysbiosis and this genotype is
related to worse NAFLD progression (Henao-Mejia et al., 2012).
Gut-liver axis alteration is a good example of immune
activation mediated by changes in gut microbiota composition,
but crosstalk between microbiota, metabolic state and the
immune system is rather more complex. For instance, a
microbiota enriched in bacteria within the Cytophaga￾Flavobacter-Bacteroides phylum has been related to the
differentiation of IL-17-producing T-helper cells (Th17) in a
TLR-independent signaling pathway (Ivanov et al., 2008). This
mechanism could be relevant in fatty liver disease development
as IL-17 is associated to inflammatory response and NAFLD
progression (Tang et al., 2011). Moreover, dietary factors strongly
determine this kind of response as some lipids in the diet (long
chain fatty acids) induce the differentiation of Th17 while SCFAs
determines an opposite action by promoting T regulatory cells
proliferation (Honda and Littman, 2016; Ma et al., 2018). This
points to a multidirectional interplay between microbiota, diet
and immune system (Belkaid and Hand, 2014), thereby both
atherogenic diet and HFD could induce NAFLD associated
features in a mice model, but just the former trigger a systemic
activation of the immune system in a mechanism related to
different microbial composition between mice receiving each
diet (Pindjakova et al., 2017).
Impact on Lipid Metabolism
Lipid metabolism and transport are key processes in the
establishing of NAFLD as steatosis arise from a deregulation of
fatty acids input and uptake by the liver (Goedeke et al., 2018).
Dysbiosis may enhance the steatotic process by the upregulation
of enzymes implicated in de novo lipogenesis, mainly acetyl-coA
carboxylase 1 (ACC1), and fatty acid synthase (FAS) (Bäckhed
et al., 2004; Parnell et al., 2012). It is also remarkable the role of
the fasting-induced adipocyte factor (FIAF). Synthesis of FIAF
could be inhibited by enteric bacteria, increasing lipoprotein
lipase activity and consequently triglyceride storage in the
adipose tissue and the liver. Moreover, FIAF downregulation
induces lipogenic enzymes expression through carbohydrate￾responsive element-binding protein (ChREBP) and sterol
regulatory element-binding protein 1c (SREBP-1c) (Leung et al.,
2016).
Metabolites Derived From Intestinal
Microbiota
Some metabolites produced by gut microorganisms exhibit an
antagonist role. On one hand, ethanol derived from alcohol
producing bacteria like Escherichia coli may lead to hepatic injury
in a similar way to what happens in alcoholic liver disease
(Zhu et al., 2013). On the other hand, SCFAs are the main
energy source for colonic epithelial cells, thus contributing to
maintain intestinal integrity. Therefore, SCFAs supplementation
had a positive effect in gastrointestinal diseases (Lu et al., 2016).

Porras et al. Microbiota Modulation in NAFLD
FIGURE 1 | Mechanisms linking dysbiosis to NAFLD development. Dysbiotic gut microbiota is related to increased intestinal permeability and delivery of harmful
substances (LPS, EtOH) to the liver, inducing inflammatory pathways mediated by PRRs. Inhibition of FIAF by IM promotes expression of lipogenic enzymes.
Microbiota can modify bile acid pool in a mechanism associated to insulin resistance and lipogenesis enhancement. Choline metabolism is also affected by
imbalanced microbiota, reducing lipid exportation through VLDL. ACC, acetyl-coA carboxylase; ChREBP, carbohydrate-responsive element-binding protein; EtOH,

However, some studies report elevated SCFAs in overweight
patients (Schwiertz et al., 2010; Teixeira et al., 2013) pointing
out that they are used as energy source increasing adipogenesis.
This may be influenced by the specific SCFA; thus propionate
can reduce de novo lipogenesis in the liver while acetate can
be used as a lipogenic substrate (Tilg et al., 2016). In addition,
lower butyrate and butyrate-producing bacteria are often related
to metabolic disturbances (Brahe et al., 2013), suggesting that the
specific pattern of SCFAs may be crucial for understanding their
implication in obesity and NAFLD.
Role of Bile Acids
A paradigmatic example of gut-liver communication is the
enterohepatic circulation of bile acids. Apart from emulsification
of lipids, bile acids act as signal molecules through the farnesoid
X-receptor (FXR) (Wieland et al., 2015). Activation of FXR
results in attenuation of lipogenesis and gluconeogenesis in the
liver and improved insulin sensitivity. Given that gut microbiota
can alter the bile acid pool and signaling properties, this is
another interesting mechanism of dysbiosis-induced NAFLD
development (Arab et al., 2017). Noteworthy, a gender-specific
bile acids production pattern has been associated to FXR￾dependent changes in intestinal microbiota in response to a
Western diet, thus pointing to a potential causal link to the
increased risk of NAFLD development in males (Jena et al., 2017;
Sheng et al., 2017).
Choline Metabolism
Finally, choline plays a crucial role in NAFLD. In fact, diets
depleted in methionine and choline have been widely used in
animal models to induced NASH (Almonacid-Urrego et al., 2012;
Guzmán et al., 2013). Similarly, HFD-driven dysbiosis tends to

Porras et al. Microbiota Modulation in NAFLD
reduce choline bioavailability promoting NASH development
(Schnabl and Brenner, 2014). This is because choline is crucial for
very low-density lipoprotein assembly and exportation of lipids
from the liver. Moreover, microbiota may metabolize choline into
toxic methylamines which enhance liver injury. Hence, dysbiosis
promotes NAFLD through choline metabolism alteration in a
dual way (Aron-Wisnewsky et al., 2013). Again, the relevance
of this mechanism could be a gender issue as requirements for
choline are lower in premenopausal women, who exhibit reduced
risk of fatty liver development when they are subjected to choline
deprivation (Fischer et al., 2007).
Taken all together, this evidence demonstrates that the
microbiome defines metabolic state in humans, and makes
a significant contribution to the establishing of obesity and
NAFLD.
MODULATION OF INTESTINAL
MICROBIOTA
Although gut microbiota is relatively stable in adults, it is
still susceptible to change. Environmental factors such as diet,
exposure to toxic compounds or antibiotic consumption alter
microbiome composition either in a positive or negative way.
Therefore, it is possible to promote changes in microbiota
composition to resemble a healthier profile.
Due to the critical role of intestinal microbiota in NAFLD
development, this approach may be suitable in clinical practice,
so we should focus on current strategies that have shown
modulatory capacity over dysbiosis and gut-liver axis activation,
including substances with probiotic/prebiotic actions, Fecal
Microbiota Transplantation (FMT) or physical exercise protocols
(Figure 2).
Probiotics
The use of live bacteria with potential health benefits for
the host when provided in adequate amounts, namely
probiotics, is a promising strategy to manage obesity-associated
disorders. Bacteria belonging to Lactobacillus, Streptococcus, and
Bifidobacterium genera are the most frequently used probiotics
due to the growing body of literature supporting their health￾promoting effects and because all of these integrate the normal
human gut microenvironment (Iacono et al., 2011).
One of the first evidence of probiotics efficacy in the
treatment of fatty liver was shown in a study conducted by Li
et al. (2003) in which the administration of VSL#3 (a mixture
of 8 lactic acid producer strains) to genetically obese mice
improved liver histology, counteracted inflammation and showed
a reduction of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) plasma levels.
Following this experiment, many others have found effectiveness
of probiotic treatment with different bacterial strains in animal
models. This protective effect of probiotics in NAFLD is not
yet fully understood but it has been proposed that antibacterial
substance production, epithelial barrier function enhancement,
and regulation of the immune system and subsequent intestinal
inflammation may be implicated (Iacono et al., 2011).
Due to the nature of probiotics it is assumed that their
beneficial effects are partially linked to IM modulation. Recent
studies have assessed the modulation of microbiome in response
to probiotics administration (Table 1). As mentioned above
Lactobacillus species have been widely used in different animal
studies despite the fact that some researchers have found an
increased relative abundance of Lactobacillus in obese patients
(Armougom et al., 2009; Million et al., 2012). Using HFD-fed
mice, Kim et al. (2016) reported that probiotic supplementation
with Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG can increase Bacteroidetes
number, reduces Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio and modulates
dysbiosis. These results correlated with hepatic steatosis and
dyslipidemic state amelioration, supporting findings of a
previous work where Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG improved
liver histology, modulating lipid metabolism, enhanced intestinal
barrier integrity, and increased small intestine total bacteria
concentration in a fructose-based NAFLD model (Ritze et al.,
2014). Lactobacillus administration also achieved counteracting
effects of a more aggressive model of NAFLD. In this
way, Lactobacillus casei strain Shirota reverted reduction of
Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium genera abundance induced in
response to a MCD diet while these contributed to diminish
endotoxemia, inflammation and NASH development (Okubo
et al., 2013). Distinct species may alter microbial composition in
a particular way but with concordant results. Thus, L. paracasei
CNCMI-4270 and L. rhamnosus CNCM I-3690 were equally
capable of attenuating body weight gain, steatosis and insulin
resistance but induced strain-specific changes in microbial
structure in a HFD model (Wang et al., 2015). Authors also
found metabolic syndrome amelioration due to Bifidobacterium
animalis subsp. lactis I-2494 administration, concluding that
each probiotic bacterial specie influence a particular set of
functionally relevant microbial taxa.
It is noteworthy that a low proportion of Bifidobacterium
has been observed in human studies associated with obesity and
insulin resistance development (Brahe et al., 2016). It has been
described in a HFD-based mice model that supplementation
with B. pseudocatenulatum CECT7765 reduced hepatic steatosis
and counteracted liver and systemic inflammation associated
with decreased translocation of LPS to the bloodstream
(Moya-Pérez et al., 2015). This effect correlates with partial
restoration of intestinal microbiota especially in genera
affected by the HFD belonging to the Firmicutes phylum
(unclassified Lachnospiraceae, Allobaculum, and unclassified
Erysipelotrichacea). Bifidobacterium abundance was restored
to control levels in the probiotic treated group while Gram￾negative bacteria enhanced by HFD (Escherichia/Shigella and
Desulfovibrionaceae) were reduced. In a previous similar study
the same strain also induced an increase in Bifidobacterium
spp. in HFD-fed animals, while the opposite was true for
Enterobacteriaceae (Cano et al., 2013). This shift in microbiota
composition was associated with metabolic changes, thereby
reducing body weight, fat accumulation in the liver, serum
cholesterol, insulin resistance, and inflammatory cytokines.
It is not clear whether combination of probiotics could result
in a synergistic effect. Positive results with VSL#3 and other
Lactobacillus/Bifidobacterium mixes sustain this hypothesis.

For example, intervention with a probiotic mix containing
Bifidobacterium infantis, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Bacillus
cereus was capable of counteracting HFD-induced dysbiosis and
related gut-liver axis activation along with the improvement
of liver histology and inflammation. Bacteroides, bifidobacteria
and Lactobacillus increased in the probiotic treated group,
while E. coli and Enterococcus showed an opposite trend
(Xue et al., 2017). Furthermore, kefir, a beverage containing
up to 50 species of lactic bacteria, acetic acid bacteria and
yeast improved obesity and steatosis in HFD-fed mice (Kim
et al., 2017) by changing the intestinal microbiota. Thus,
Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio reduced in mice receiving kefir.
Moreover, kefir administration increased the relative abundance
of Lactobacillus/Lactoccocus as well as total yeast population,
mainly Candida. The latter suggest that not only bacteria but
also some yeast species may have probiotic effects. In this
way, Saccharomyces boulardii reduced body weight, fat mass,
inflammation and steatosis in obese diabetic (db/db) mice
(Everard et al., 2014b). Metagenomic analysis of the cecal content
of db/db mice revealed a notable increase in Bacteroidetes
and a reduced proportion of Firmicutes, Proteobacteria and
Tenericutes. Some genera associated to obesity and diabetes such
as Odoribacter, Ruminococcus, and Prevotella were also negatively
affected, while others identified as beneficial like Bacteroides were
increased.
In conclusion, therapeutic potential of probiotics has been
extensively proved in animal models. HFD-based nutritional
murine models remain the standard to evaluate the effect of
probiotic over metabolic disturbances and hepatic steatosis.
At the microbiome level, probiotics tends to induce changes
in microbial composition toward a profile that is considered
as beneficial, i.e., reduced Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio or
increased abundance of Bifidobacterium genus.
Some human studies have been carried out using probiotics in
the management of NAFLD (Table 2). Despite promising clinical
results, lack of microbiome based studies is the major weakness
of these studies. Common outcomes of probiotics interventions
include serum aminotransferases levels decrease and serum or
liver lipid content lowering effects (Aller et al., 2011; Wong et al.,
2013; Nabavi et al., 2014; Famouri et al., 2016). Some studies also
found improvements in inflammatory markers. Anti-obesogenic
effect of probiotics in humans is not yet fully accepted. Several
groups found lower BMI in patients treated with probiotics (Alisi
et al., 2014; Nabavi et al., 2014), others did not find significant
changes. In this sense, results from the meta-analysis by Loman
et al. (2018) confirmed that probiotic administration effectively
reduces BMI and hepatic enzymes (ALT, AST, γ-GT), but their
effect on lipid profile improvement did not reach significance. In
addition, Sepideh et al. (2016)reported lower insulin and reduced
HOMA-IR in the intervention group, constituted by NAFLD
patients consuming two capsules a day of a probiotic mixture,
supporting evidences from studies with diabetic patients (Yao
et al., 2017).
Prebiotics
Prebiotics are defined as compounds that beneficially affect the
health of the host by selectively stimulating the growth and/or
activity of a limited number of bacteria (Everard et al., 2011).
Many of the substances that respond to the prebiotic concept are
nondigestible carbohydrates which provide a source of energy
for commensal bacteria and are resistant to digestive enzymes
reaching the distal gastrointestinal tract (Ojo et al., 2016). Within

them, the most recognized are inulin-type fructans (inulin,
oligofructose and fructooligosaccharides) and galactans (galacto￾oligosaccharides) (Wilson and Whelan, 2017), although many
others are under investigation, including lactulose, cellulose,
resistant starches, hemicelluloses, gums, and pectins.
Prebiotic administration has shown a variety of actions
concerning metabolic function in different studies. Reduced
weight gain was found in several studies, in diet induced
(Bomhof et al., 2014; Kumar et al., 2016; Steensels et al.,
2017), in genetically obese rodents (Daubioul et al., 2000)
and in overweight or obese humans (Parnell and Reimer,
2009) supplemented with prebiotic fiber. Alteration to appetite
hormones release may be responsible for this anti-obesogenic
effect (Cani et al., 2004; Hira et al., 2018). However, a meta￾analysis of 26 human studies did not find any significant
association between prebiotic consumption and body weight
Frontiers in Physiology | www.frontiersin.org 8 December 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 1813

Porras et al. Microbiota Modulation in NAFLD
reduction (Kellow et al., 2014). Nevertheless, in some animal
studies reduction of fat mass was achieved without significant
body weight changes (Roberfroid et al., 2010). Treatments with
prebiotics are frequently associated to fasting glycemia, glucose
tolerance and insulin sensitivity improvement (Everard et al.,
2011; Pachikian et al., 2013; Chan et al., 2016). Focusing on
liver functionality, prebiotics have shown its capacity to modulate
lipid metabolism. In this way, prebiotics are able to reduce
plasma triglyceride levels (Correia-Sá et al., 2013) or limit its
accumulation in the liver, preventing steatosis and liver injury in
different animal models (Daubioul et al., 2002; Sugatani et al.,
2006, 2012). Furthermore, improvement of insulin resistance,
reduction in blood and hepatic triglycerides and prevention of
steatosis have also been described for plant extracts enriched in
fructans like Jerusalem artichoke in rats under a high fructose diet
(Chang et al., 2014).
Prebiotic treatment has shown the ability to counteract
inflammation. This effect may be related to the attenuation of
serum LPS increase that occurs following dysbiosis (Cani et al.,
2009; Neyrinck et al., 2012). LPS concentration reduction may be
reached by the improved expression and activity of tight junction
proteins like zonula occluden-1 (ZO-1) and occludin, preventing
endotoxins translocation to the bloodstream (Delzenne et al.,
2011). Furthermore, enhanced gut hormones release and
endocannabinoid system blockade (Cani et al., 2009; Muccioli
et al., 2010) are described mechanism exerted by prebiotics to
promote gut barrier functionality, contributing to ameliorate
inflammation and insulin resistance.
In line with the significant contribution of SCFAs to maintain
intestinal health, a SCFAs production enhancement effect was
described for some prebiotics, with special attention to butyrate
(Everard et al., 2014a; Tochio et al., 2016). A synergistic action
between butyrogenic species and acetate producers including
species of Bifidobacterium genus in presence of oligofructose has
also been documented (Falony et al., 2006). This is in accordance
with repeatedly reported increase in Bifidobacterium spp. during
fructooligosaccharides (FOS) supplementation (Cani et al., 2009;
Meyer and Stasse-Wolthuis, 2009; Mao et al., 2015; Wang et al.,
2017a). Other changes in microbial composition at phylum
and genus levels were found in animal models of obesity after
prebiotic consumption. Hence, 10 weeks of inulin/oligofructose
(1:1) supplementation reversed the increase of Firmicutes and
the reduction of Bacteroidetes observed in genetically obese
rats, while at genus level leads to a dose-dependent increase in
Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium (Parnell and Reimer, 2012).
With regard to NAFLD, only a few studies have analyzed the
effect of treatment with prebiotics or prebiotic-like compounds
on gut microbiome and its impact in liver disease (Table 3).
Beyond hepatic lipid content reduction, heterogeneity of models
and substances used does not allow general conclusions. High
fiber diet (Saha and Reimer, 2014), enzyme treated wheat bran
(Kieffer et al., 2016), pectin (Fåk et al., 2015), and guar gum
(Fåk et al., 2015; Janssen et al., 2017) interventions achieved
body weight reduction, but no effect on obesity was found
in the other treatments. In the study by Janssen et al. (2017)
guar gum supplementation of a high fat/high cholesterol/high
fructose also improved glucose tolerance and increased SCFAs
production after 18 weeks of treatment. However, a surprising
pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic effect were found in treated
mice. At the microbiome level, three studies reported an
increase in Bacteroidetes in line with the tend to lower
Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio in healthy subjects. As mentioned
before, a bloom in Bifidobacterium is frequently associated to
prebiotic supplementation; indeed high prebiotic fiber diet, guar
gum, and FOS achieved this bifidogenic effect (Neyrinck et al.,
2012; Pachikian et al., 2013; Saha and Reimer, 2014; Janssen et al.,
2017). Other changes in microbiome composition were described
in single studies and further investigation is needed to validate
and interpret these findings.
A study by Matsumoto et al. (2017) in MCD-fed mice
included insights from gut-liver axis preservation by FOS. FOS
supplementation to MCD increased acetate and propionate and
restored butyrate to control levels. Moreover, FOS contributed
to preserve ZO-1 location in tight junctions, increased IgA
secretion, and downregulated TLR4 expression in the liver.
In agreement, Fåk et al. (2015) reported increased SCFAs
production in HFD-fed rats as a result of guar gum and pectin
administration, and found a specific profile for each compound
and physicochemical state of the preparations. Moreover,
physicochemical state of the compounds also differently affected
microbiota composition and fat metabolism, pointing medium
viscosity guar gum as the most effective preparation to prevent
fat deposition in the liver in a mechanism associated to its
bifidogenic effect and butyrate production capacity.
There are several studies which have tested the effects
of prebiotics in obese and metabolic syndrome patients
and performed metagenomic analysis. In a recent research
with overweight children, oligofructose-enriched inulin
administration significantly increased Bifidobacterium spp.
and decreased Bacteroides vulgatus (Nicolucci et al., 2017).
Microbiota composition modification was accompanied by
reduced body weight gain and body fat along with attenuated
IL-6 and triglyceride serum levels. Two studies in obese
women subjected to inulin-type fructans administration showed
concordant results in microbiome analysis pointing to increased
representation of Bifidobacterium after the treatment (Dewulf
et al., 2013; Salazar et al., 2015). Interestingly, in the study by
Dewulf et al. (2013) changes induced by inulin-type fructans in
Bifidobacterium and in Faecalibacterium prausnitzii negatively
correlated with levels of LPS. The study by Salazar et al. (2015)
went down to the species level and found that B. adolescentis,
B. longum and B. pseudocatenulatum are the most affected
Bifidobacterium species after prebiotic administration. Finally,
a clinical trial in obese prediabetic individuals with galacto￾oligosaccharides (GOS) corroborated the bifidogenic effect of
prebiotics in obese humans (Canfora et al., 2017). However, no
metabolic effects were reported. This is in conflict with a previous
similar work where authors described reduced inflammatory
markers, insulin resistance, total cholesterol and triglycerides
linked to Bifidobacterium increase (Vulevic et al., 2013). Different
dosage (15 g/day vs. 5.5 g/day) and study population (obese
prediabetic vs. overweight and metabolic syndrome susceptible
individuals) could be responsible for these contrasting
results.

Porras et al. Microbiota Modulation in NAFLD
Evidence from human studies with prebiotics involving
NAFLD patients is scarce. In a pilot study with NASH patients
oligofructose administration (16 g daily for 8 weeks) achieved a
reduction of AST levels and showed a tendency to lower ALT and
triglycerides (Daubioul et al., 2005). However, lack of histological
evaluation and microbiome-based analysis limits the conclusions
of this study. A recent clinical trial with the same dosage of
oligofructose for 24 weeks provides the first reports of histological
improvement and changes in microbial composition in response
to a prebiotic compound in NASH patients (Bomhof et al., 2018).
Despite the small sample size, a significant reduction of steatosis
and NAFLD activity score (NAS) were found in the prebiotic￾treated group vs. placebo. Moreover, prebiotic administration
resulted in increased Bifidobacterium and reduced Clostridium
cluster XI relative abundance.
In addition, several clinical trials with synbiotics corroborated
results obtained with prebiotics and probiotics administration
alone (Malaguarnera et al., 2012; Ferolla et al., 2016; Mofidi
et al., 2017). In the research conducted by Malaguarnera et al.
(2012) the combination of Bifidobacterium longum and FOS with
lifestyle modification exceeded benefits of lifestyle modification
alone. Both treatments reduced NASH index, HOMA-IR, total
cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, TNF-α, AST, and ALT
serum levels. Moreover, supplementation with the synbiotic gave
better results for HOMA-IR, LDL cholesterol, CRP, TNF-α, and
AST. This greater efficacy of the synbiotic was associated with
diminished serum endotoxin levels in this group. Moreover,
Ferolla et al. (2016) also reported reduction of BMI and steatosis
grade after inulin and guar gum intervention, despite the fact that
there were no effects on SIBO or intestinal permeability.
Among the strategies to modulate intestinal microbiota,
the administration of probiotics and prebiotics is the most
developed so far, however there is still a lack in studies into
humans. Ongoing clinical trials involving probiotics, prebiotics
and synbiotics in NAFLD (Cho et al., 2018) could bring more
light into this spot to make the step from basic research to clinical
practice.
Polyphenols
Vegetables polyphenols are known for their well described
antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties (González￾Gallego et al., 2010). Polyphenols are classified according to
their chemical structure in non-flavonoids, represented by
stilbenes and phenolic acids, and flavonoids which constitutes
a heterogeneous subgroup of compounds with a common C
skeleton. Flavonoids are subsequently classified in flavanones,
flavones, dihydroflavonols, flavonols, flavan-3-ols or flavanols,
anthocyanidins, isoflavones, and proanthocyanidins.
Polyphenols are widely investigated both in in vivo and in
vitro assays against different pathologies. Many of them have
shown their capacity to counteract different features of metabolic
diseases, including lipid metabolism alteration, insulin resistance,
inflammation, and oxidative stress development (Pisonero￾Vaquero et al., 2015b; Van De Wier et al., 2017). Furthermore,
they are not completely digested in the gastrointestinal tract and
suffer transformations by colonic microbiota when they reach
large intestine, thus being considered prebiotic molecules (Gil￾Cardoso et al., 2016). Moreover, the toxicity of the phenolic group
gives them antibacterial activity and many of them may inhibit
biofilm formation, pointing to another mechanism to influence
microbiota composition (Espín et al., 2017). In addition, phenolic
compounds metabolism into a large amount of low molecular
weight bioactive metabolites and their dissemination in the
organism make them capable of exerting vast effects in different
organs including the intestine and the liver (Cardona et al., 2013).
Due to the contribution of inflammation and oxidative stress
on its pathogenesis, besides the starring role of IM, NAFLD
becomes a perfect target for polyphenol-based therapies. A large
number of polyphenols as well as plant and fruits whole extracts
with high polyphenol content have been tested with promising
results. Quercetin, flavonoids from green tea, soy isoflavones,
and rutin are the most studied flavonoids in NAFLD, along with
silymarin, a mixture of flavonoids from Sylbum marianum whose
major component is the flavonoid silybin (Pisonero-Vaquero
et al., 2015a). Resveratrol is the most investigated polyphenol
within stilbenes (Aguirre et al., 2014). Many of these studies were
carried out in animal models but just the most recent include
microbiome analysis to prove the prebiotic capacity of these
compounds (Table 4). In addition, whole extract of grapes and
different berries rich in polyphenols are effective in reshaping the
microbiota of HFD-fed mice (Anhê et al., 2015; Baldwin et al.,
2016; Heyman-Lindén et al., 2016).
In this way, supplementation of HFD or high fat/high
sugar (HFHS) diet with polyphenols tends to lower the
Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio in rodent models, counteracting
the effect of the diet (Etxeberria et al., 2015; Masumoto et al.,
2016; Cheng et al., 2017; Guo et al., 2017; Porras et al., 2017).
Furthermore, some bacterial genera and species seem to be
more frequently influenced by these compounds. It is remarkable
the frequent association of polyphenol administration with
Akkermansia genus and A. muciniphila abundance (Anhê et al.,
2015; Etxeberria et al., 2015; Roopchand et al., 2015; Baldwin
et al., 2016; Heyman-Lindén et al., 2016; Masumoto et al., 2016;
Porras et al., 2017). Considering that Akkermansia has a strong
correlation with a healthy metabolic status, this observation
enforces the protective role of polyphenols against NAFLD
through gut microbiota modulation. The possible mechanism
linking Akkermansia and metabolic effects of polyphenols is the
maintenance of gut barrier integrity. Akkermansia is capable
of preserving mucus layer preventing gut-liver axis disruption
and endotoxemia (Gil-Cardoso et al., 2016). Thus, proteins
involved in intestinal integrity maintenance are commonly
modified by polyphenol treatments. Trans-resveratrol alone
or in combination with quercetin significantly increased the
expression of TJP (tight junction protein) 2 and occludin in HFD￾fed mice (Etxeberria et al., 2015). This up-regulation effect was
also found for TJP1 and occludin following the administration of
procyanidins (Masumoto et al., 2016) or curcumin (Feng et al.,
2017), and for claudin-1 and occludin after a quercetin treatment
(Porras et al., 2017). Quercetin also tends to stimulate SCFAs
production in in vivo models of metabolic syndrome and NAFLD
(Etxeberria et al., 2015; Porras et al., 2017). SCFAs, especially
butyrate, could be mediators of the polyphenol contribution

to intestinal integrity. It is noteworthy that several butyrate￾producing bacteria like Faecalibacterium and Roseburia are
overrepresented in the microbiota of polyphenol-treated mice
(Heyman-Lindén et al., 2016; Masumoto et al., 2016; Cheng et al.,
2017; Guo et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2017; Van Hul et al., 2017).
In addition, beneficial effects of polyphenols can be attributed
to inhibition of potentially harmful bacteria. As mentioned
before, Helicobacter pylori has been related to NAFLD. There
are studies reporting a decline in Helicobacter genus or H. pylori
using flavonoids (Feng et al., 2017; Porras et al., 2017), flavonoid
rich extracts (Chua et al., 2016; Asha et al., 2017), and another
natural compounds (Zulueta et al., 2015).
Metabolic effects of polyphenols against NAFLD can be
confirmed by human studies. Unfortunately, metagenomics
analyses are lacking, except for a research that addressed the
potential therapeutic use of red wine polyphenols in metabolic
syndrome patients. In this clinical trial, 30 days of red wine or
dealcoholized red wine were associated with increased detection
of Fusobacteria and Bacteroidetes and reduced proportion of
Firmicutes in fecal samples. Within Firmicutes, Clostridium
was reduced while Blautia coccoides, Eubacterium rectale,
Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Roseburia, and Lactobacillus were
increased after the treatment. With regard to Bacteroidetes,
Prevotella detection was enhanced and Bacteroides diminished.
Moreover, higher Bifidobacterium levels were found in the
treated group along with a normalization of Escherichia coli
representation (Moreno-Indias et al., 2016).
Fecal Microbiota Transplantation
Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) was used as a therapy
for the first time in present-day medicine in 1958 in order
to treat pseudomembranous colitis due to Clostridium difficile
infection (CDI) (Eiseman et al., 1958). Since then FMT has
been widely used in CDI and it is now accepted as a successful
treatment for recurrent CDI when antibiotic treatment fails.
Moreover, after conflicting results (Moayyedi et al., 2015; Rossen
et al., 2015), a recent study has shown clinical improvement
following intensive-dosing multidonor FMT in patients with
intestinal bowel disease (IBD) (Paramsothy et al., 2017) which,
at least in part, involves dysbiosis as a pathogenic mechanism
(Matsuoka and Kanai, 2015). Patients undergoing a FMT
display a shift in microbiota composition characterized by an
increase in microbial diversity due to the colonization of foreign
bacteria, ideally with better metabolic functionality (Cohen and
Maharshak, 2017).
Intestinal microbiota involvement in other pathologies points
to FMT as an alternative treatment for a wide range of diseases,
including extraintestinal pathologies. Metabolic disorders are
possible future targets of FMT (de Groot et al., 2017). However,
lack of clinical studies limits the evidence that support efficacy
of this approach in obesity and associated metabolic syndrome.
Just a short study in humans proved that transplantation of fecal
microbiota from lean donors to metabolic syndrome patients
resulted in the amelioration of insulin resistance which was
related to increased butyrate-producing bacteria (Vrieze et al.,
2012). However, a recent case report of a woman who quickly
developed obesity after receiving FMT from an overweight donor
(Alang and Kelly, 2015) suggests that the opposite is also possible.
Fortunately, studies with animal models provide useful
information to determine FMT possibilities in metabolic
diseases. For example, FMT from control diet-fed counterparts
administered orally every third day for 8 weeks attenuates diet
induced metabolic syndrome in Sprague-Dawley rats fed a high
fructose diet (Di Luccia et al., 2015). Despite the fact that
there is no effective measures against obesity, this treatment
succeeded to ameliorate oxidative damage in the liver and
skeletal muscle as well as systemic inflammation in a mechanism
that involve reduction of plasma LPS. The improvement in
metabolic condition was associated to lower representation of
Coprococcus and Ruminococcus genera in the treatment group.
Using a different approach, Rabot et al. (2016) did not find
any effects in the onset of obesity in HFD-fed GFm after a
single transplantation of feces from responder (R) and non￾responder (NR) to the diet donors. They only reported a
slightly improvement in glucose tolerance for NR receiver mice
associated to a higher detection of Bacteroidetes in this group.
Despite the fact that there is very different etiology, NAFLD
shares some mechanism with alcohol liver disease (ALD),
including the presence of dysbiosis. A recent study has shown
that FMT prevents alcohol induced liver injury along with
modulation of the IM (Ferrere et al., 2016). Feces from ethanol￾resistant mice were administered to sensitive mice three times

a week, reaching an amelioration of hepatic lesions. Microbiota
from treated mice replicated that of resistant mice and both
shared potentially beneficial genera of the Bacteroidaceae family:
Bacteroides, Parabacteroides, Prevotella, and S24-7. Some studies
have assessed the possibility to transfer metabolic improvement
achieved after a prebiotic or polyphenol treatments trough FMT.
Sung et al. (2017) found an improvement in glucose homeostasis
and reduced fat mass in HFHS fed mice linked to changes in
IM composition after 8 weeks of resveratrol supplementation.
Feces collected from resveratrol treated mice were administered
to another cohort of mice in three FMT experiments. Mice fed
with the HFHS diet receiving FMT from resveratrol-treated mice
showed improved glucose homeostasis in comparison with mice
receiving feces from control mice and alterations of IM that
resemble the profile observed in the donor group.
With regard to NAFLD, a study by Le Roy et al. (2013),
in which microbiota from HFD-fed donors selected according
to glycemia, inflammation and steatosis was transplanted to
GFm, showed that the onset of obesity in response to a
HFD in C57BL/6J mice is independent of the microbiota, in
the same way as the experiment conducted by Rabot et al.
(2016). However, they found lower fasting glycemia, HOMA
index and NAFLD activity score (NAS) in the receiver of
the NR microbiota. On the other hand, responder phenotype
was associated with hepatic enzymes alteration and lipid
metabolism disruption with increased de novo lipogenesis. This
experiment demonstrated not only that intestinal microbiota
is strongly associated with metabolic status and NAFLD, but
also that NAFLD is a transmissible condition through intestinal
microbiota transplantation. Recently, Zhou et al. (2017) carried
out the first study of FMT in a diet-induced NASH model.
Specific pathogen free (SPF) C57BL/6 mice were fed with a HFD
for 16 weeks and given fresh feces from the control group daily
for the latter 8 weeks. The transplantation resulted in reduced
body weight, fat deposition, liver index and transaminase serum
levels. FMT also restored intestinal integrity through recovering
tight junction protein ZO-1 expression. This action over the
intestine was related to increased butyrate production in the
cecum and alleviation in endotoxemia. At hepatic level FMT
clearly attenuated hepatic steatosis, lobular inflammation, and
hepatocyte ballooning. Nevertheless, microbiota analysis showed
opposite results to previous studies with HFD mice, reporting
increased Bacteroidetes and reduced Firmicutes in the HFD
group. Consistently, FMT treated mice display a shift toward
the opposite, reducing Bacteroidetes to Firmicutes ratio. These
authors also remarked the positive role of Christensenellaceae
and Lactobacillus genera in metabolic disturbance prevention by
FMT.
These results show the feasibility of FMT in the treatment
of NAFLD. However, several issues on the procedure remain
unanswered, such as parameters for donor selection, processing
of feces, the use of single or multiple infusions or the usage of
antibiotics previous to the transplant. Development of a non￾invasive technique as the encapsulation of the donor microbiota
to allow oral administration could spread this kind of treatment
to a general audience (Delaune et al., 2018).
Exercise
Lifestyle modifications are one of the traditional treatments
in obesity related diseases. In NAFLD patients lifestyle change
following dietary recommendations and more active behavior
was associated with a moderate reduction of body weight,
about 7–10%, which improved hepatic histology, decreasing NAS
and its components (Vilar-Gomez et al., 2015). Apart from
dietary interventions, physical exercise interventions are a valid
way to reach weight loss. In human studies, physical exercise
has demonstrated its ability to reduce cardiovascular events,
improving metabolic state and counteracting many other features
associated with obesity. With regard to liver disease, physical
exercise is capable of modulating hepatic steatosis, improve
insulin sensitivity or affect body composition independently of
weight loss (Houghton et al., 2016). These changes are attributed
to reduced expression of lipogenic enzymes, enhanced muscle
fatty acids uptake, modulation of adipokines or attenuation of
oxidative stress in the liver after exercise training (Ordonez et al.,
2015).
Only few studies have considered that the effect of exercise
on the metabolic state may be at least partially driven by
intestinal microbiota modulation and no relation to NAFLD
has been yet established. Modifications in intestinal microbiota
have been found in rodent models under exercise protocols.
Both voluntary wheel running (Matsumoto et al., 2008; Queipo￾Ortuño et al., 2013) and forced running on a treadmill (Petriz
et al., 2014) are effective in inducing changes in healthy
animals. However these different approaches may differentially
affect microbiome composition (Allen et al., 2015). In addition,
development stage may influence plasticity of gut microbiota
to changes induced by exercise. Thus, juvenile rats undergo
larger modifications than adult individuals toward a leanness
microbiota as evidenced by the increase in Bacteroidetes to
Firmicutes ratio after 6 weeks of voluntary wheel running (Mika
et al., 2015).
With regard to metabolic syndrome, Evans et al. (2014)
provided evidences that 6 weeks of voluntary exercise may lead
to a shift in microbiota composition along with weight gain
prevention and improved insulin tolerance in mice fed with HFD.
Supporting findings with probiotic/prebiotic administration,
exercise tends to reduce Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio as well as
increase bacterial richness under HFD conditions. An analogous
experiment by Campbell et al. (2016) confirms effects of
voluntary exercise in HFD-fed mice on body weight gain along
with increased insulin sensitivity, modulation of inflammatory
state and enhanced secretion of satiety hormones. At the
microbiome level, greater detection of F. prausnitzii in both lean
and obese exercised groups as well as enrichment in Allobaculum
and Clostridium genera are the most remarkable outcomes in
this study. Furthermore, a forced running training protocol in
genetically obese and hypertensive rats resulted in profound
microbiota modification (Petriz et al., 2014). In this study,
analysis of fecal samples showed an enhancement of bacterial
diversity after training protocol. In contrast, these authors found
increased relative abundance of Firmicutes with exercise in the
three experimental groups (obese, hypertensive, and lean rats).

Porras et al. Microbiota Modulation in NAFLD
At genus and specie levels Lactobacillus was increased in obese
rats after exercise and six species (Streptococcus alactolyticus,
Bifidobacterium animalis, Ruminococcus gnavus, Aggregatibacter
pnemotropica, and Bifidobacterium pseudolongum) were more
abundant in this group more than the others. The study
into hypertensive condition is also relevant being hypertension
a manifestation associated with NAFLD. Hypertensive rats
displayed a particular microbiota and it was also susceptible
to be modified by exercise, exhibiting greater Allobaculum
and less Aggregatibacter and Sutterella after training. Finally,
in a study with genetically diabetic and non-diabetic mice,
forced running 5 days a week for 6 weeks correlated
with lower Bacteroides/Prevotella spp. and Methanobrevibacter
spp. (Lambert et al., 2015). Interestingly, exercise increased
Bifidobacterium spp. in control mice but an opposite trend
was found in diabetics, suggesting that previous metabolic state
of the host influence the modulatory effect of the exercise
protocol.
Welly et al. (2016) compared effects of exercise vs. caloric
restriction in obesity-prone HFD-fed rats. Briefly, one group
performed voluntary running while other remains as a weight￾matched sedentary control by limiting the availability of food
to mimic the weight loss achieved by exercise. They found that
exercise exceeded benefits of weight loss alone, confirming that
exercise effects against metabolic disturbances are independent
of weight loss. Both treatments reduced adiposity, ameliorated
inflammation and improved lipid profile but only exercise
increased insulin sensitivity and achieved greater LDL reduction.
These changes were related to microbiome modifications by
exercise manifested by reduced relative abundance of two
undefined genera in the S24-7 and Rikenellaceae families and
increased that of Streptococcaceae family in the exercised rats.
Interestingly, the undefined genera of the Rikenellaceae family
were positively correlated with liver triglycerides.
High intensity interval training (HIIT) seems to have similar
or even greater metabolic effects than continuous aerobic
training in diet-induced obese mice (Wang et al., 2017b) and
in obese subjects (Wewege et al., 2017). Likewise, these effects
can be related to changes in microbiota composition. According
to Denou et al. (2016) in HFD-fed mice 6 weeks of HIIT
performed 3 days per week induced shifts in the microbiota
opposite to that promoted by diet, increasing Bacteroidetes as
well as diversity within this phylum including a positive effect
on Bacteroidales order and lowering Firmicutes in the distal
gut. These changes correlated with improved insulin tolerance;
however, authors did not find reduced body or fat mass in trained
HFD-fed mice.
The impact of exercise on gut microbiota has also been
shown in several human studies which identify a particular
microbiota associated to individuals with divergent degrees of
physical activity. Different microbiota composition was found
between professional athletes and healthy controls, showing
higher bacterial richness in athletes vs. controls (Clarke et al.,
2014; Barton et al., 2017). Surprisingly, athletes present lower
Bacteroidetes and greater Firmicutes. Akkermansia muciniphila
increased both in athletes and in low BMI controls. Moreover,
microbiota of active lifestyle women differs from those with
a more sedentary pattern, with enhanced detection in the
former of potentially beneficial bacteria like Bifidobacterium spp.,
Roseburia hominis, A. muciniphila, and F. prausnitzii (Bressa
et al., 2017).
In order to address the relationship between exercise￾induced changes in microbiota and metabolic effects in the
host, exercise impact on gut barrier should be considered.
Several studies include evaluation of intestinal tissue after
exercise in animal models. Exercise exerts protective effect
on intestine epithelium counteracting the morphological
changes associated to HFD and reducing inflammation
(Campbell et al., 2016). This effect is sometimes attributed to
alterations in gut motility by exercise that reduces intestinal
transit time, but evidences are inconsistent. SCFAs also
contribute to maintain intestinal health and their production
was found to be significantly higher in professional athletes
(Barton et al., 2017). In the experiment by Matsumoto
et al. (2008) who described an increase in cecal n-butyrate
concentration associated to the presence of two butyrate￾producing bacterial species in the exercised group. The latter
was also reported for Evans et al. (2014) who found that exercise
significantly increased Bacteroidales S24-7, as well as butyrate￾producing Firmicutes families Clostridiaceae, Lachnospiraceae,
and Ruminococcaceae. Finally, intestinal health promoting
bacteria like A. muciniphila are associated to exercise and
active lifestyle in humans (Clarke et al., 2014; Bressa et al.,
2017).
CONCLUSION
Intestinal microbiota dysbiosis and related gut-liver axis
activation are now accepted as a critical process in NAFLD
development. Due to the absence of a gold standard treatment
for fatty liver disease, development of novel therapeutic strategies
is a priority to manage NAFLD patients. Different approaches
have been made to modulate intestinal microbiota: pre/probiotics
administration, FMT, and lifestyle modification including
physical exercise interventions. All of these strategies lead to
NAFLD and associated metabolic disturbances remission in in
vivo models, but evidence from clinical trials is scarce. Moreover,
only the most recent animal studies have carried out microbiome
analysis to show that the results are linked to IM modulation.
Furthermore, the findings obtained from these experiments need
to be taken skeptically, due to the conflicting results. For this
reason, it is too early to ensure the effectiveness of any of these
methods. It is important to remark that different strategies are not
mutually exclusive and maybe a synergistic combination of them
could make the difference. In conclusion, intestinal microbiota
modulation emerges as a potential therapeutic option for obesity￾associated NAFLD. However, its application in clinical practice
requires further investigation due to the lack in studies into
humans.
