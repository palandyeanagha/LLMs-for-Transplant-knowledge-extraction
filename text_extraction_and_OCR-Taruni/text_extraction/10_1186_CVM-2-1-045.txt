Introduction
Data from the International Society of Heart and Lung
Transplantation (ISHLT) show that since 1995 the number
of heart transplants (HTs) performed worldwide has gradu￾ally declined and was approximately 3000 in the year 2000
[1]. This small number of procedures is the main reason
why only few randomized single-center, and even fewer
multicenter, clinical trials have been performed so far in HT
recipients. Other factors have hampered the performance
of controlled studies in HT recipients. These include the
following: the lack of a uniform system for measuring rejec￾tion severity until the publication of the ISHLT rejection
grading system in 1991; the approximately 80% 1-year
survival, which creates the requirement for patient popula￾tions larger than the total number of HTs performed world￾wide to detect differences between the effects on outcome
of two therapeutic interventions; the lack of reliable ‘surro￾gate’ endpoints, such as the incidence and severity of
cardiac allograft vasculopathy, owing to the insensitivity of
contrast coronary angiography for the detection of cardiac

Abstract
Only a few randomized clinical trials have been performed so far in heart transplant recipients, mainly
because of the relatively small number of heart transplants performed worldwide each year. The main
focus of the few controlled trials that have been completed has been the prevention and treatment of
heart allograft rejection. In the area of pharmacologic immunosuppression, both biological agents and
drugs have been the subject of investigation. Among the biological agents, chimeric monoclonal
antibodies directed against the interleukin (IL)-2 receptor, which have been found to be safe and
effective in renal transplant recipients, are now undergoing the test of controlled trials in heart
transplant recipients. Immunosuppressive drugs that have been studied in controlled trials include
calcineurin inhibitors (such as the microemulsion formulation of cyclosporine and tacrolimus) and
inhibitors of purine synthesis, such as mycophenolate mofetil. Non-pharmacologic prophylactic
immunosuppression with photopheresis has also been tested in a prospective, multicenter,
randomized trial. New immunosuppressive regimens, such as mycophenolate mofetil combined with a
monoclonal antibody against the IL-2 receptor, are being tested with the aim to reduce or eliminate
calcineurin inhibitors or corticosteroids. Although clinical approaches to the induction of tolerance have
undergone preliminary clinical evaluation, the ability to induce tolerance to an allograft in humans
remains an elusive goal.

allograft vasculopathy; the lack of uniformity in maintenance
immunosuppression and in the threshold to treat rejection;
and the priority traditionally given to kidney transplant recip￾ients for the randomized evaluation of new immunosup￾pressive therapies, which are then applied to HT recipients
without the test of controlled trials.
Despite these serious limitations, some important con￾trolled evaluations of new immunosuppressive therapies
have been conducted in HT recipients during the past
decade. The main focus of these trials has been the pre￾vention and treatment of HT rejection (Fig. 1).
Monoclonal antibodies
Antilymphocyte antibody preparations have been used as
adjuncts to standard triple-drug immunosuppression [con￾sisting of cyclosporine (CSA), corticosteroids, and azathio￾prine (AZA)] to prevent rejection in the early postoperative
period after HT [2]. However, polyclonal antibody prepara￾tions, such as rabbit anti-thymocyte and horse anti-lympho￾cyte globulins, lack specificity and consistency of
immunosuppressive action between batches, and require a
central intravenous (IV) line for administration. These limita￾tions have been overcome with the development of mouse
monoclonal antibodies directed against specific lympho￾cyte targets (Table 1). The first monoclonal antibody to be
used in HT recipients was OKT3, a murine preparation
directed against the CD3 molecule on activated T cells [3].
The CD3 molecule fulfills a critical role in the recognition
of alloantigens by the T cell receptor. In HT recipients
OKT3 has been associated with serious adverse effects,
which include the following: (1) the development of a
cytokine release syndrome, owing to the ability of OKT3 to
activate T cells, ranging in severity from a mild febrile
illness to a syndrome of severe volume overload and
hemodynamic compromise [4]; (2) the appearance of
human anti-mouse antibodies that decrease the efficacy or
preclude the use of subsequent OKT3 courses and can
mediate humoral rejection [5]; (3) the increased incidence
of opportunistic infections, such as those caused by
cytomegalovirus (CMV) [6]; and (4) the increased inci￾dence of post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders [7].
These limitations have spurred the development of mono￾clonal antibodies that have a greater human component
and achieve a more selective suppression of the immune
system. These monoclonal antibodies can be either
‘chimeric’, when the entire variable portion remains of
murine origin, and ‘humanized’, when the only remaining
murine component is the complementarity-determining
region, the portion of the variable region that binds to the
antigen. Among these, a chimeric antibody has been
developed against the CD4 molecule, which is present on
helper T cells and has a central role in alloantigen recogni￾tion and the early phases of allograft rejection. The
chimeric anti-CD4 antibody consists of the variable region
of the murine CD4 antibody cM-T412 and the constant
region of a human IgG1κ immunoglobulin [8].
Before its use in HT recipients, this antibody had been
shown to be safe in patients with autoimmune diseases.
Figure 1
Stages of T cell activation: multiple targets for immunosuppressive agents. Signal 1: stimulation of T cell receptor (TCR) results in calcineurin
activation, a process inhibited by cyclosporin (CyA) and tacrolimus. Calcineurin dephosphorylates nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT),
enabling it to enter the nucleus and bind to interleukin-2 gene promoter. Corticosteroids inhibit cytokine gene transcription in lymphocytes and
antigen-presenting cells by several mechanisms. Signal 2: co-stimulatory signals are necessary to optimize T cell interleukin-2 gene transcription,
prevent T cell anergy, and inhibit T cell apoptosis. Experimental agents, but not current immunosuppressive agents, interrupt these intracellular
signals. Signal 3: stimulation of interleukin-2 receptor induces the cell to enter the cell cycle and proliferate. Signal 3 can be blocked by interleukin￾2 receptor antibodies or by sirolimus, which inhibits second messenger signals induced by the ligation of interleukin-2 receptor. After progression
into the cell cycle, azathioprine and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) interrupt DNA replication by inhibiting purine synthesis. Reproduced with

In one study the outcome of 11 HT recipients receiving
the chimeric CD4 monoclonal antibody cM-T412 during
the operation and on postoperative days 1–7, 9, 11, 13,
17, and 21 was compared with that of 11 patients receiv￾ing antithymocyte globulin (ATG) until the achievement of
therapeutic CSA levels. Maintenance immunosuppres￾sion was similar in the two groups. Over a mean observa￾tion time of 600 days, the number of acute rejection
episodes per 100 patient days was 0.26 in the CD4
group, in comparison with 0.41 in the control group, indi￾cating a 40% reduction in rejection rates. The mean time
to the first rejection episode was 43.7 days in the CD4
monoclonal antibody-treated group and 25.3 days in the
control group. Furthermore, in comparison with the
control group, the group treated with CD4 monoclonal
antibody had fewer infections (0.49 compared with 0.91
per 100 patient days) and better survival (91% compared
with 73%) at one year after HT. It should be noted that
none of these differences between the two groups
achieved statistical significance because of the small
patient population [8].
In contrast with resting T cells, antigen-activated T cells
express high-affinity interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptors. The
use of monoclonal antibodies directed against epitopes
of these receptors has been shown to prolong allograft
survival in animal models. In a prospective randomized
trial, BT53, a murine IgG1 anti-IL-2 receptor antibody,
was compared with OKT3 for the prevention of early
post-HT rejection [9]. Over a median follow-up period of
34 months, rejection tended to occur earlier in the
BT563-treated group than in the OKT3-treated group,
but 3-month and 12-month rejection and infection rates
were similar. Notably immunohistochemistry showed that,
during acute rejection, in the presence of circulating
BT563, cells bearing IL-2 receptors were present in only
20% of rejection biopsies, whereas these cells were
detected in 75% of the rejection biopsies in patients not
treated with BT563 [10]. These findings indicate that,
despite adequate blockade of the IL-2/IL-2 receptor
pathway, patients can still develop acute rejection. This
might be due to the redundancy of the cytokine network,
in which other cytokines, such as IL-5, can fulfill the role
of the blocked IL-2. A cytokine release syndrome
occurred in most OKT3-treated patients, but not in any of
the BT563-treated patients.
More recently, two chimeric monoclonal antibodies
against IL-2 receptors [daclizumab (Zenapax; Hoffmann￾La Roche, Nutley, New Jersey, USA) and basiliximab
(Simulect; Novartis Pharma AG, Basel, Switzerland, and
East Hanover, New Jersey, USA)] have been tested in
renal transplant recipients in randomized clinical trials. In
comparison with triple immunosuppression, both mono￾clonal antibodies against IL-2 receptors significantly
reduced 6-month rejection rates and improved survival. In
a single-center study, 55 nonsensitized patients under￾going their first HT were randomly assigned to receive
either prophylactic immunosuppression with daclizumab
(1.0 mg/kg) given IV within 24 hours of HT and every
2 weeks thereafter, for a total of five doses, or conven￾tional perioperative immunosuppression [11]. In both
groups, maintenance immunosuppression consisted of
CSA, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and prednisone.
During the perioperative period, acute rejection rates were
significantly lower in the daclizumab group than in patients
treated conventionally (0.19 compared with 0.64;
P = 0.02). Acute rejection occurred in 18% of the
daclizumab group and in 63% of the control group (rela￾tive risk 2.8; 95% confidence interval 1.1–7.4; P = 0.04).
Throughout the follow-up period, ISHLT grade 3 rejection
occurred in two daclizumab-treated and in nine controls
(P = 0.003) and the first rejection episode was signifi￾cantly delayed in the daclizumab group (P = 0.004). There

were no adverse reactions to daclizumab, and infection
and malignancy rates were similar between groups.
A multicenter, prospective, randomized clinical trial of
daclizumab against no antilymphocyte antibodies is con￾tinuing in HT recipients treated with CSA, MMF and
prednisone.
Calcineurin inhibitors
The introduction of CSA has improved the survival of HT
recipients owing to decreased mortality from infection and
rejection (Table 2). One of the major limitations of the orig￾inal oil-based CSA formulation [Sandimmune (SM); Novar￾tis Pharma] is its variable and unpredictable bioavailability
[12]. In contrast, the new microemulsion formulation
[Neoral (NL); Novartis Pharma] might have more consis￾tent bioavailability, which has been associated with lower
rejection rates in kidney and liver recipients.
A total of 380 HT recipients at 24 centers were enrolled
in a double-blind randomized trial comparing the safety
and efficacy of SM and NL. At 6 months after HT, allo￾graft and patient survivals were the same for both
groups. The frequencies of ISHLT grade ≥ 3A rejection
episodes were identical in the two groups. In compari￾son with SM patients, fewer NL patients required rescue
rejection therapy with antilymphocyte antibodies (ATG or
OKT3) (5.9% compared with 14.1%; P = 0.01). Interest￾ingly, female HT recipients in the NL arm who had ISHLT
rejection grade ≥ 3A had a 46% lower rejection rates
than SM-treated females (31.3% compared with 57.6%;
P = 0.032). Fewer infections were seen in the NL group
(Fig. 2). With the exception of the early postoperative
period, in which creatinine levels were higher in the NL
group, overall renal function was similar in the two
groups [13].
Tacrolimus (FK506; Fujisawa, Japan) has also been com￾pared with SM in both a US trial and a European trial.
Patients in the two treatment groups had similar rates of
rejection, infection, hyperglycemia, and renal function. The
tacrolimus-treated patients had lower rates of hyperten￾sion requiring pharmacologic therapy in both the US (48%
compared with 71%; P = 0.05) and European (59.5%
compared with 87.55%; P = 0.025) trials [14,15].
Purine inhibitors
The largest study conducted so far in HT recipients is the
3-year double-blind randomized multicenter trial compar￾ing the effects of MMF with those of AZA in 650 HT recip￾ients treated with CSA and prednisone [16]. MMF inhibits

lack the salvage pathway for purine synthesis, MMF selec￾tively inhibits lymphocyte proliferation.
The protocol-specified primary endpoints were 6-month
acute rejection with hemodynamic compromise and 12-
month patient/allograft survival. In this double-blind active￾control trial, 28 centers randomized 650 patients
undergoing their first HT to receive either MMF
(3000 mg/day) or AZA (1.5–3.0 mg/kg per day), in addi￾tion to CSA and prednisone. Rejection and survival data
were obtained for 6 and 12 months, respectively. Because
11% of the patients withdrew before receiving study drug,
data were analyzed on all randomized patients (enrolled
patients), and on patients who received study medication
(treated patients). Survival and rejection were similar in
enrolled patients (MMF, n = 289; AZA, n = 323). In
treated patients (MMF, n = 289; AZA, n = 289), the MMF￾treated patients had a significant reduction in mortality at
1 year [18 (6.2%) compared with 33 deaths (11.4%);
P = 0.031] and in the requirement for treatment for rejec￾tion (65.7% compared with 73.7%; P = 0.026) (Fig. 3).
There was a trend for fewer MMF patients to have
≥ grade 3A ISHLT rejection (45.0% compared with
52.9%; P = 0.055) or to require OKT3 or ATG (15.2%
compared with 21.1%; P = 0.061).
Opportunistic infections, mostly herpes simplex, were
more common in the MMF group (53.3% compared with
43.6%; P = 0.025). There were 102 MMF-treated patients
and 94 AZA-treated patients who had baseline and
12 months intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) studies.
Although a post hoc endpoint, there was a significant
benefit of MMF treatment compared with AZA in the
mean change in lumen area from baseline to 12 months
after HT. Lumen area increased by 0.33 mm2 in the MMF
group compared with a decrease of 0.81 mm2 in the
AZA group (P = 0.007). At 3 years, evaluation of the allo￾graft’s coronary arteries with IVUS revealed a trend for
intimal thickening to involve a smaller portion of the ves￾sel’s circumference in MMF-treated patients than in
AZA-treated patients (59° compared with 159°;
P = 0.07). The 3-year survival was greater in MMF￾treated patients than in AZA-treated patients (88.1%
compared with 81.6%; P = 0.029), correlating with a
35% reduction in mortality. Most of the excess deaths in
the AZA-treated patients were due to cardiovascular
events, infection and allograft rejection. The average
daily dose of study medication during the 12 months
after HT was 2.72 g/day for MMF and 1.92 mg/kg per
day for AZA patients. Among the treated patients, with￾drawal from study drug occurred in 93 MMF patients
(32.2%) and in 104 AZA patients (36%) and was for
similar reasons in the two groups.
This study has received some criticism about the timing of
randomization and the clinical/statistical analysis of signifi￾cance [17]. Randomization of patients occurred before HT,
but patients initiated study medication some time after HT.
As stated above, 11% of randomized patients could not
take the oral medication within 5 days of transplantation
and were withdrawn from the study without receiving study
medication. The decision to withdraw a patient was per￾formed in a double-blind manner by investigators. Although
demographic characteristics were balanced for the
enrolled and treated populations, those patients random￾ized to MMF and excluded from the treated group had a
higher death/retransplantation rate. Critics of the study also

point out that MMF was not demonstrated to be superior to
AZA in either the intent-to-treat or the as-treated analysis
for the prevention of acute graft rejection with hemody￾namic compromise at 6 months according to the original
protocol definition of hemodynamic compromise.
The primary endpoint was changed from rejection with
hemodynamic compromise to rejection with severe hemo￾dynamic compromise because the 10–15% rate of the
latter type of rejection was believed by the steering com￾mittee to be more clinically relevant than the 33% rate
observed with the broader initial definition of hemody￾namic compromise. The study was designed to demon￾strate equivalence between groups for the 12-month
patient and graft survival. In the analysis of the enrolled
patients, the observed difference in survival rates for MMF
minus AZA was 2.6% (87.2% compared with 84.8%; con￾fidence interval –2.5% to 7.6%; P = 0.402). On the basis
of this result, some believe that the study can only claim
equivalence rather than superiority of MMF over AZA.
Some even question the use of AZA as the active control,
because the contribution of AZA to a prevention of acute
rejection in the first 6 months after HT has not been clearly
quantified [17]. Despite these potential limitations, this
study’s validity is supported by the double-blind design,
the standardization of rejection diagnosis and treatment,
and the analysis of ‘treated patients’, which provided valu￾able, clinically relevant information.
Photopheresis
Currently available rejection therapies improve graft sur￾vival by nonspecific immunosuppression, leaving the host
at increased risk of opportunistic infections, malignancies
and other serious adverse effects. Moreover, consider￾able morbidity and mortality persist as a result of acute
episodes of acute rejection and cardiac allograft vascu￾lopathy. Treatment directed at suppressing donor-spe￾cific T cell clones in the recipient have the potential to
decrease graft rejection without further increasing the
toxicity of immunosuppressive drugs. In photopheresis
the patient’s peripheral blood is removed and separated
into leukocyte-depleted blood, which is returned to the
patients, and leukocyte-enriched blood, which is exposed
to ultraviolet radiation in the presence of extracorporeally
administered liquid methoxalen [18]. Methoxalen, which is
photoactive, covalently binds to DNA pyrimidine bases,
cell-surface molecules, and cytoplasmic components in
the exposed white cells, causing a lethal defect. These
cells are then reinfused into the patient and die over
1–2 weeks, but during that interval they stimulate an
autologous suppressor response, in part mediated by T
cells, that targets nonirradiated T cells of similar clones.
Cross-links in the DNA do not fully explain the
immunomodulatory effects of photopheresis, because
only 2–5% of the patient’s mononuclear cells are affected
with each treatment.
It has been shown that photopheresis-treated lympho￾cytes secrete inflammatory mediators, such as IL-6 and
tumor necrosis factor α, that affect the entire immune
cell population [19]. Other studies have suggested that
photopheresis-treated mononuclear cells stimulate the
generation of clone-specific suppressor T cells [20].
Apoptosis has been observed in photopheresis-treated
peripheral blood lymphocytes and might be important in
immunoregulation [21]. Another possibility is that photo￾pheresis alters the unique T cell receptor associated
with the expanded T cell clone, making it more suscepti￾ble to clearance by the immune system. In one study, 60
consecutive eligible recipients of primary HTs were ran￾domly assigned to standard triple-drug immunosuppres￾sion with CSA, AZA and prednisone alone or in
conjunction with photopheresis [22]. The photopheresis
group received a total of 24 photopheresis treatments,
each pair of treatments given on two consecutive days,
during the first 6 months after HT. The regimen for main￾tenance immunosuppression, the definition and treat￾ment of rejection episodes, the use of prophylactic
antibiotics, and the schedule for heart biopsies were
standardized in all 12 centers. All the cardiac biopsy
samples were graded in a blinded manner at a central
pathology laboratory. Plasma from the subgoup of 34
patients (57%) who were enrolled at the 9 US centers
was analyzed by amplification by polymerase chain reac￾tion for CMV DNA.
After 6 months of follow-up, the mean number of episodes
of acute rejection per patient was lower in the photophere￾sis group than in the group undergoing standard therapy
(0.91 ± 1.0 compared with 1.44 ± 1.0; P = 0.04). Signifi￾cantly more patients in the former group had only one or
no rejection episodes than in the latter group (81% com￾pared with 48%), and significantly fewer patients in the
former group had at least two rejection episodes (18%
compared with 48%; P = 0.02). A rebound increase in
rejection rates did not occur after completion of the photo￾pheresis treatments during the second 6 months of follow￾up. There was no significant difference in the time to a first
episode of rejection, rejection associated with hemody￾namic compromise, or survival at 6 and 12 months.
Although there were no significant differences in the rates
and types of infection, CMV DNA was detected significantly
less frequently in the photopheresis group than in the group
undergoing standard therapy (P = 0.04) (Fig. 4). Multivariate
analysis revealed that this decrease was independent of the
donor’s and recipient’s CMV status and treatment of rejec￾tion, and that use of photopheresis was the only variable
independently associated with the decrease [22]. The main
limitations of this study include its small population, and the
lack of a placebo group and of investigators’ blinding.
However, immunosuppression, the diagnosis and treatment
of rejection episodes, the use of prophylactic antibiotics,
Current Controlled Trials in Cardiovascular Medicine Vol 2 No 1 Costanzo

and the cardiac biopsies’ schedule were strictly standard￾ized between all centers. Furthermore, acute rejection, the
primary endpoint of the study, was assessed at a central
pathology laboratory in a blinded manner.
Pravastatin
Pravastatin, an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coen￾zyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, has been used in HT recip￾ients because it is safe and effective in lowering cholesterol
levels after HT. However, a randomized trial in HT recipi￾ents has shown that pravastatin can affect HT outcome not
only by its lipid-lowering effects, but also because of previ￾ously unknown immunosuppressive actions [23]. Early after
HT, patients were randomly assigned to receive either
pravastatin (47 patients) or no HMG-CoA reductase
inhibitor (50 patients). At 12 months after HT, compared
with the control group, pravastatin-treated patients had
lower cholesterol levels (193 ± compared with
248 ± 49 mg/dl; P < 0.001), less frequent cardiac rejec￾tion complicated by hemodynamic compromise (3 com￾pared with 14 patients; P = 0.005), better survival (94%
compared with 78%, P = 0.025), and a lower incidence of
cardiac allograft vasculopathy as determined by angiogra￾phy and at autopsy (3 compared with 10 patients;
P = 0.049). In a subgroup of patients, IVUS measurement
at baseline and 1 year after HT showed less progression in
the pravastatin group than in the no HMG-CoA group in
maximal intimal thickness (0.11 ± 0.09 mm compared with
0.23 ± 0.16; P = 0.002) and in the intimal index
(0.05 ± 0.03 compared with 0.10 ± 0.10; P = 0.031).
In a subgroup of patients, the cytotoxicity of natural killer
cells was lower in the pravastatin than in the control group
(9.8% compared with 22.2% specific lysis; P = 0.014).
Although there was no consistent relationship between
high values of cytotoxicity of natural killer cells and acute
rejection episodes, several patients in the control group did
exhibit elevations of cytotoxicity that preceded or coincided
with the onset of acute rejection. Pravastatin and CSA
alone inhibited cyototoxic T lymphocyte cytotoxicity,
although not significantly. The combination of pravastatin
and CSA acted synergistically to inhibit cytotoxic T lympho￾cyte function (20.3% compared with 41.4% in the group
receiving CSA alone; P < 0.01). These findings suggest
that the combination of pravastatin and CSA enhances the
overall level of immunosuppression in HT recipients [24].
Possible future studies
Owing to the observation that the nephrotoxicity of certain
immunosuppressive drugs can negatively affect long-term
HT function and survival, new regimens are being designed
that consist of MMF with or without the anti-CD25 agent
daclizumab (Table 3). The common denominator of these
new immunosuppressive regimens is the reduction or elimi￾nation of calcineurin inhibitors or corticosteroids [25].
Researchers in transplantation immunobiology have identi￾fied several T cell accessory molecules that participate in
the alloimmune response through three possible methods:
(1) stabilization of the interaction between cytotoxic T cells
and the target cell; (2) provision of the antigen-dependent
second signal necessary for facilitating signal transduction
in T cells; (3) enhancement of the interaction between T cell
receptors and major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-
bearing antigen (Table 4). For instance, lymphocyte function
associated antigen-1 (LFA-1) and intracellular adhesion
molecule-1 (ICAM-1) are accessory molecules on T cells
involved in adhesion reactions and co-stimulatory signals.
Monoclonal antibodies against these accessory molecules
are now in clinical trials. The use of antibodies against both
these adhesion molecules, and the related strategy of com￾bining ICAM-1 antisense oligonucleotides with anti-LFA-1,
might prove to be even more promising. CD40 is a recently
described molecule found on antigen-presenting cells,
whereas CD40 ligand is expressed on T cells after stimula￾tion with antigen. The interaction of CD40 with CD40 ligand
is thought to be involved in T cell co-stimulation. Monoclonal
antibodies against CD40 ligand have been effective in
inducing tolerance in experimental transplant models.
CD28 is another accessory molecule involved in T cell
activation. The binding of ligands B7-1 and B7-2 to CD28
promotes T cell activation, proliferation, and differentiation.
Another monoclonal antibody being developed targets the
co-stimulatory ligand, B7. CTLA4Ig is a chimeric protein
formed from the fusion of the CTLA-4 gene (closely
related to the gene that codes for CD28) and human IgG.
It has greater affinity than CD28 for the ligands B7-1 and
B7-2, and thus helps to thwart T cell activation.

Tolerance
The ability to induce tolerance to an allograft in humans
remains a highly desirable but elusive goal [26–28]. Clini￾cal approaches to the induction of tolerance have included
the following: (1) donor-specific blood transfusions; (2)
one MHC-haplotype/DR matched blood transfusion and
(3) donor bone-marrow infusion after host conditioning.
Several strategies to induce tolerance are also being
tested in experimental studies. Mixed chimeric infusions,
involving a mixture of the recipient’s and the donor’s bone
marrow cells, are given with nonmyeloablative radiation to
avoid the development of graft-versus-host disease. Pep￾tides derived from class I and class II MHC molecules
have been found to induce unresponsiveness to an allo￾graft. Finally, the induction of expression of Fas ligand on
donor cells, which can bind to the Fas molecule expressed
on activated T cells, can lead to the apoptosis of the T
cells specifically activated against the allograft [28].
Conclusion
Immunosuppression is rapidly changing because of the
increasing number of drugs and biological agents making
the transition from the laboratory to clinical trials. The
results of randomized studies in HT recipients support the
belief that MMF and antibodies against IL-2R decrease
the incidence and severity of acute rejection. However,
many important questions about immunosuppression in
HTs remain unanswered. These include whether new
agents provide more specific or simply more potent
immunosuppression, which combination of drugs can
achieve maximal efficacy with minimal adverse effects, and
whether the new agents will prevent chronic rejection and
improve long-term survival after HT.
The hope for the future is that specific inhibition of antigen
recognition, T cell co-stimulation, and function of acces￾sory molecules will induce long-term acceptance of a
transplanted organ without the complications of ‘broad
spectrum’ immunosuppression.

Evolving low-toxicity maintenance immunosuppression regimens
Regimen Comment
Cyclosporine + azathioprine/MMF + steroids Standard regimen. MMF preferred because it reduces incidence of 
acute rejection; significantly more expensive. Neoral replacing 
Sandimmune in many centers
Tacrolimus + azathioprine + steroids Alternative regimen to above
Daclizumab/basiliximab + MMF + steroids IL-2 receptor blockers used only in early post-transplant period but may 
obviate need for calcineurin inhibitor
Tacrolimus + MMF + steroids Preliminary studies suggest very low incidence of acute rejection; 
gastrointestinal side effects are common but minimal steroid should 
reduce risk of diabetes mellitus
Sirolimus + cyclosporine + steroids Sirolimus may allow greater reduction in cyclosporin or steroid doses
