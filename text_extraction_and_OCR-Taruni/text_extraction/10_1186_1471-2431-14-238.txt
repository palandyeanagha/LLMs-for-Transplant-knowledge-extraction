Abstract
Background: This study aimed to describe the clinical characteristics, radiological features and outcomes of 42
children with post-infectious bronchiolitis obliterans (PIBO).
Methods: Forty-two children diagnosed with PIBO were prospectively studied at the First Hospital of Jilin University
in northern China between January, 2008 and January, 2013. Their clinical characteristics, lung high resolution
computed tomography (HRCT) findings and pulmonary function tests were reported.
Results: In children with PIBO, adenovirus was the most common etiologic agent (21/42), followed by Mycoplasma
pneumoniae (M. pneumoniae). All of the patients presented with repeated wheezing and tachypnea. In addition, 22
patients required intensive management, while six patients required home oxygen therapy. HRCT findings were
consistent with the PIBO diagnosis in all of the patients. Pulmonary function testing was useful in evaluating
therapeutic responses. Systemic steroids combined with azithromycin were effective for PIBO treatment.
Conclusions: Severe adenovirus bronchiolitis and M. pneumoniae infections have a higher risk of development for
PIBO. HRCT and pulmonary function testing are useful in the diagnosis of PIBO. The degree of airway obstruction
did not differ significantly between adenovirus and M. pneumoniae. A combination of steroids and azithromycin
offers some benefit in treating these patients.

Background
Bronchiolitis obliterans (BO) was first reported and
named in 1901 as small airway injury-related chronic in￾flammation airflow obstruction syndrome [1]. BO can be
caused by various etiological factors, including infection,
organ transplantation and exposure to toxic fumes. BO
results in bronchiolar epithelial cell and subepithelial
structural damage and inflammation [2]. Furthermore,
improper small airway repair with intraluminal scarring
can aggravate inflammation [3]. Post-infectious bron￾chiolitis obliterans (PIBO) is especially common in chil￾dren [2,4]. The incidence of PIBO in severe adenovirus
pneumonia is high. One study found that 47.4% of chil￾dren hospitalized with adenovirus pneumonia developed
BO during 5 years of follow-up [5]. However, the patho￾genesis of PIBO is still not completely understood. In
addition, there is no effective treatment and it has a poor
prognosis [6,7]. PIBO has a huge psychological and eco￾nomic burden on the families of affected children, as
well as the community. The clinical manifestations, in￾cluding repeated coughing, wheezing and shortness of
breath following activities, are nonspecific. In addition,
PIBO progression varies, chest x-ray and laboratory tests
are not sufficient to diagnose the disease, and PIBO is
often misdiagnosed as asthma, pneumonia and other
diseases. Despite the great impact of PIBO on children,
clinical data is scarce and most clinicians have limited
awareness of the disease. Early diagnosis of PIBO is diffi￾cult, and the effect of therapy is very poor. Therefore,
we prospectively analyzed the clinical characteristics,
radiological features and outcome of 42 children with
PIBO in order to describe key aspects of the diagnosis
and treatment of PIBO.
Methods
This prospective study included 42 PIBO cases from
January, 2008 to January, 2013 at the First Hospital of

Jilin University. All of the children included in the study
were less than 14 years of age, were diagnosed with
PIBO in our hospital, had an acute lower respiratory in￾fection (ALRI) with an infective pathogen identified, and
had more than 6-months of follow-up. The diagnosis of
PIBO was based on previously published criteria [8-10]
and met all of the following criteria: 1) Documented
ALRI in otherwise healthy children with exercise intoler￾ance, and repeated or continuous wheezing, coughing
and tachypnea; 2) Mosaic ground-glass patterns, bronch￾iectasia or pulmonary atelectasis on high resolution
computed tomography (HRCT); 3) Persistent obstructive
pattern on pulmonary function tests after the acute
event in older children; and 4) Exclusion of other dis￾eases, such as asthma, primary ciliary dyskinesia, cystic
fibrosis, foreign body aspiration, tuberculosis, AIDS and
other immune function defects. All of the patients had
follow-up visits at 1, 3 and 6 months after being diag￾nosed with PIBO and underwent pulmonary function
tests. In addition, we recorded the clinical symptoms for
all of the patients. The Ethics Committee of the First
Hospital of Jilin University approved the study protocol.
The parents or legal guardians of the participants gave
written informed consent.
All patients underwent HRCT at the time of diagnosis
and underwent pulmonary function testing using Master
Screen Paed (Jaeger Company, Wurzburg, Germany) at
the time of diagnosis and during follow-up at 1, 3 and
6 months. Airway obstruction was defined using tidal
breathing analysis (in children aged <3 years) indicating
an tPTEF% tE<40% and VPEF%VE<40% or impulse oscillo￾metry (in children aged 3–6 years) showing Z5 (magni￾tude of respiratory system impedance at 5 Hz), R5 (total
respiratory resistance at 5 Hz) and X5(distal capacitive
reactance at 5 Hz) >120% of the predicted value. HRCT
scans were obtained using a Somaton Sensation Cardiac
64 (Siemens AG, Forchheim, Germany) CT scanner. The
scans covered an area from the upper margin of the
shoulder to the lower end of the liver. The specifications
of the scans included a 0.33 s rotation time, 1.2 spiral
distance, 0.6 mm collimation, 0.6 mm slice thickness,
120 kV voltage, and 120 mA tube-current. After the
scan, images were obtained using a 1 mm reconstruction
increment and a 0.6 mm reconstruction distance. Each
HRCT examination consisted of five images, which were
obtained at the levels of the aortic arch, midway between
the aortic arch and tracheal carina, tracheal carina, mid￾way between the tracheal carina and the right hemi￾diaphragm, and 1 cm above the right hemidiaphragm.
All of the reconstructed images were loaded into the
HRCT work station. The radiological findings were
interpreted by three senior radiologists. A consensus
through discussion was obtained whenever there was a dis￾crepancy. Mosaic pattern, bronchiectasis and peribronchial
thickening are considered as the most common CT signs
in PIBO, and the latter two features are used as diagnostic
criteria for PIBO [11].
Age at the initial acute injury, days of initial
hospitalization, oxygen requirements and pulmonary
function tests were evaluated. If a patient was admitted
to the hospital in an acute state, the etiological agents
were investigated by serology. All of the patients had
documented results of the etiologic agent causing the
original lower respiratory tract infection. Indirect im￾munofluorescence testing was used to diagnose infec￾tion with Influenza A virus-IgM, Influenza B virus-IgM,
M. pneumoniae-IgM, Chlamydia pneumoniae (C. pneu￾moniae)-IgM, Legionella pneumophila-IgM, Q fever
rickettsia-IgM, adenovirus (ADV)-IgM, respiratory syn￾cytial virus (RSV)-IgM, and parainfluenza virus-IgM.
Based on serological test results, we classified the 42
patients into three groups: 1. Adeno-associated BO
(G1); 2. M. pneumoniae -associated BO (G2); and 3.
Other agent BO (G3). A flexible fiberoptic broncho￾scope (FOB; Olympus LF-2) was used in 20 patients to
view their airways and to check for any abnormalities
before diagnosis.
The treatment protocol for PIBO included oral pred￾nisone and azithromycin. The dose of prednisone was
initially 1.5 mg/kg/day, which was given in divided
doses. Four weeks later the dose was gradually de￾creased to a single early morning dose of 0.5 mg/kg/
day. The total course of steroids was 6 to 9 months.
Azithromycin was given orally at 5 mg/kg/day, once
daily for 3 consecutive days per week for 6 months. All
of the patients were evaluated 6 months following the
initiation of treatment. The effect of treatment was cat￾egorized as follows: 1) Effective, a reduction in wheez￾ing by more than 50%, increased activity (tolerated
daily physical activity such as climbing stairs, walking,
etc.), and lung function remained stable (the rate of de￾cline of pulmonary function was less than 10% when
compared with the initial test); and 2) Ineffective, de￾fined as no improvements in wheezing, decreased activ￾ity and worsened lung function (the rate of decline of
pulmonary function was more than 10% when com￾pared with the initial test).

pulmonary function test results were expressed as
mean ± SD. Independent sample t-tests were used to
compare continuous variables and Fishers exact tests
were used to compare categorical variables. SPSS 17.0
was used for all statistical analyses. The level of statis￾tical significance was set at p <0.05.
Results
A total of 42 children diagnosed with PIBO based on
HRCT and clinical features were identified. Table 1
shows the distribution of HRCT findings, and Figure 1
shows HRCT findings of mosaic ground-glass patterns
and bronchiectasis in two representative cases. The clin￾ical characteristics of all of the patients with PIBO are
presented in Table 2. Among the 42 patients, 29 were
boys and 13 were girls (male/female ratio was 2.2:1).
The mean age at initial pulmonary injury was 1.46
(range 0.6–3.8) years, and the median age at diagnosis of
PIBO was 2.32 (range 0.8–5.7) years. The mean hospital
stay was 27.8 (range, 14–73) days. There were no statis￾tical differences with respect to age, gender and hospital
stay between the groups. In addition, the long-term
home oxygenation therapy (LTOT) rate was not signifi￾cantly different between G1 and G2, G1 and G3, and G2
and G3.
Initial presentations included fever in 29 (69.0%) pa￾tients, cough in 28(84.8%) patients, and tachypnea in 24
(57.1%) patients. Physical examination revealed crackles
in 28 (66.7%) patients, wheezing in 37 (88.1%) patients,
and chest retractions in 18 (42.9%) patients. All of the
patients had persistent dyspneic respirations and wheez￾ing from the time of the initial lung infection. During
follow-up, three children (7.1%) required conventional
mechanical ventilation. The initial pulmonary function
tests revealed increased airway resistance in all of the pa￾tients. Fiberoptic bronchoscopy was performed in 20 pa￾tients. Six patients had normal findings, two patients
had laryngomalacia, and 12 patients had bronchial mu￾cosal inflammation. The tidal breathing analysis revealed
a decreased tPTEF% tE (18.2 ± 0.26%, normal: more than
40%) or VPEF%VE (21.7 ± 0.32%, normal: more than
40%), suggesting obstructive airway dysfunction. The im￾pulse oscillometry results showed abnormally increased
values for Z5 (147.5 ± 19.3% of the predicted value, nor￾mal: less than 120% of the predicted value), R5 (140.4 ±
12.8% of the predicted value, normal: less than 120% of
the predicted value) and X5 (226.5 ± 13.4% of the pre￾dicted value, normal: less than 120% of the predicted
value), suggesting increased peripheral airway resistance.
Adenovirus was detected in 21 patients, including one
patient who had simultaneous Influenza A virus-IgM

positivity. M. pneumoniae specific IgM was detected in
10 patients, RSV specific IgM was positive in 6 patients,
C. pneumoniae-IgM was positive in 2 patients, and Influ￾enza B virus-IgM, Influenza A virus-IgM and Legionella
pneumophila-IgM was positive in one patient respect￾ively. The degree of airway obstruction did not differ sig￾nificantly between etiologic agents (Table 3). All of the
patients received oral corticosteroids. Twenty-six pa￾tients (61.9%) required intensive care management and
17 (40.5%) patients required mechanical ventilation due
to progressive dyspnea and respiratory failure in the
acute phase. Intravenous corticosteroid therapy was
given to 28 (66.7%) patients during the acute stage, while
six (14.3%) patients required LTOT. In addition, 31
(73.8%) patients required frequent re-admissions due to
acute exacerbations of respiratory symptoms. Further￾more, at least six months of supportive treatment was
needed for clinical improvement in 36 cases (effective
treatment). Treatment was considered effective in 36
(85.7%) patients and ineffective in six (14.3%) cases at
the end of six months of therapy. There was no significant
improvement on the CT scan images post treatment when
compared with pretreatment images (Figure 2).
Discussion
PIBO has been traditionally considered as a rare condi￾tion. In this study, we described 42 children with PIBO,
and the general characteristics were similar to previous
studies [4,8,9]. In our study, most of the patients suf￾fered from lower respiratory infections during the first
2 years of life, were hospitalized, and required oxygen
and other supportive care at discharge. In previous stud￾ies, the disease prevalence was observed to be higher in
boys than girls [10,12]. Our results were consistent with
these studies, with a male to female ratio of 2.2:1. The
pulmonary function tests suggested increased small air￾way resistance in all of the PIBO patients.
PIBO is most commonly associated with adenovirus
infection, but other pathogens such as M.pneumoniae
may also be associated with this condition [2,13-15].
This was consistent with the findings in our study, indi￾cating the need to strengthen the prevention of M. pneu￾moniae infection.
The definitive and effective treatment for PIBO is
unknown. Current treatment methods include oral azithro￾mycin and glucocorticoids, supportive care, and mechan￾ical ventilation when there are severe breathing difficulties
[12,16]. Some benefits of long term azithromycin therapy
has been found in patients with post-lung-transplant bron￾chiolitis obliterans, including improved forced expiratory
volume in one second (FEV1 ) values and decreased airway
neutrophilia and IL-8 levels [17,18]. Mechanical ventilation
is indispensable for the support of critically ill patients with
respiratory insufficiency. Our results indicated that

mechanical ventilation was needed in 40.5% of children in
the acute phase and 7.1% of children during follow-up.
Few studies have shown definitive effects of systemic
corticosteroids and oral azithromycin in the treatment of
PIBO [4,19]. Beneficial effects of azithromycin in BO have
been primarily reported in adult patients who underwent
lung transplants. This study showed that treatment with
corticosteroids and azithromycin was effective in 85.7% of
cases and ineffective in 14.3% of cases. However, we did
not have a control group, and thus our study is limited. In
a previous prospective study of 31 patients with 3.5 years
of follow-up, the outcome of the patients included clinical
remission (22.6%), persistence of respiratory symptoms
and signs (67.7%), and death (9.7%) [20].
The clinical history and HRCT images were essential
for the diagnosis of PIBO in this study, as well as for ex￾cluding other diseases. Open pulmonary biopsies, al￾though considered the gold standard, is generally not
required for the diagnosis of PIBO. This invasive investi￾gation may be considered in patients who show progres￾sive deterioration even after treatment. Pulmonary
function tests play an important role in the diagnosis
and therapeutic evaluation of PIBO. Our study showed
that airway obstruction was present in all of the patients
diagnosed with PIBO, and the degree of obstruction was
not different among the three groups.
This study had some limitations. First, open lung bi￾opsy was not obtained. Second, immunofluorescence
IgM testing was used to determine the etiological agents.
This method is accurate, quick and simple; however, the
sensitivity and specificity is lower than that of polymer￾ase chain reaction (PCR). Third, to achieve power of
80% and an alpha error of 0.05, the sample size of each
group should be 36. However, in our study, the sample
size of the three groups was 21, 11, and 10, respectively,
which reduced the power of the study. Fourth, the treat￾ments were administered at different stages of the dis￾ease. Lastly, the follow-up time limited the assessment
of long term prognosis and did not exclude the con￾founding factor of spontaneous improvement as the
child ages.
Conclusions
In conclusion, severe adenovirus bronchiolitis and M.
pneumoniae pneumonia appeared to have a higher risk
of development of PIBO in Chinese children. Lung
HRCT and pulmonary function testing contribute to the
diagnosis of PIBO. Systemic steroids in combination
with azithromycin may offer some benefit for PIBO
patients.
