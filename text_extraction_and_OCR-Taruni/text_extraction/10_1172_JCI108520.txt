A B S T R A C T The atherogenic mechanism of homo￾cystinemia has been defined by measuring endothelial
cell loss and regeneration, platelet consumption, and
intimal lesion formation in a primate model. Three
groups of baboons were studied: (a) 8 control animals;
(b) 15 animals after 3 mo of continuous homocystin￾emia; and (c) 11 animals after 3 mo of combined
homocystinemia and oral treatment with dipyridamole.
Experimental homocystinemia caused patchy endo￾thelial desquamation comprising about 10% of the aortic
surface despite a 25-fold increase in endothelial cell re￾generation. Neither endothelial cell loss nor regenera￾tion was changed significantly by dipyridamole. Homo￾cystine-induced vascular deendothelialization produced
a threefold increase in platelet consumption that was in￾terrupted by dipyridamole inhibition of platelet function.
All homocystinemic animals developed typical arterio￾sclerotic or preatherosclerotic intimal lesions composed
of proliferating smooth muscle cells averaging 10-15
cell layers surrounded by large amounts of collagen,
elastic fibers, glycosaminoglycans, and -sometimes lipid.
Intimal lesion formation was prevented by dipyridamole
therapy. We conclude that homocystine-induced endo￾thelial cell injury resulted in arteriosclerosis through
platelet-mediated intimal proliferation of smooth muscle
cells that can be prevented by drug-induced platelet
dysfunction.

(1-4). Intimal proliferative smooth muscle cell lesions,
identical in appearance to the fibromusculoelastic lesion
considered to be the precursor of atherosclerosis in man,
are transiently produced in the arteries of nonhuman
primates by a variety of methods including mechanical
deendothelialization (5-8). Furthermore, the addition
of a fatty diet, either alone or in combination with
mechanical injury, can produce the classic lesions of
atherosclerosis, the fatty streak and the fibrous plaque
(9, 10). The genesis of these lesions may involve: (a)
endothelial injury leading to focal desquamation of cells;
(b) adherence and aggregation of platelets to exposed
subendothelial connective tissue; (c) local release of
platelet constituents, including a platelet mitogenic fac￾tor (11), and passage of plasma constituents into the
underlying artery wall; (d) migration of smooth muscle
cells through fenestrae of the internal elastic lamina
into the intima and platelet-mediated intimal prolifera￾tion of smooth muscle cells; (e) formation of connective
tissue matrix by the smooth muscle cells through syn￾thesis and secretion of collagen, elastic fiber proteins,
and glycosaminoglycans; and (f) intracellular and ex￾tracellular lipid accumulation. Maximal lesion formation
occurs within 3 mo after mechanical injury. The lesions
appear to regress once the overlying endothelium has
regenerated, and resolution is virtually complete 3 mo
later in normocholesterolemic monkeys (6). This for￾mulation suggests that repeated or chronic endothelial
cell loss may be the first event leading to atherosclerosis.
In this study we test the proposition that chronic,
chemically induced endothelial cell injury produces ar￾teriosclerosis through platelet-mediated intimal prolifera￾tion of smooth muscle cells and that drug-induced plate￾let dysfunction is capable of preventing the smooth
muscle proliferative response.

METHODS
Baboon homocystine vascular model. 34 normal male
baboons (Papio cynocephalus) were studied: 8 controls, 15
chronic homocysteine infusion animals, and 11 animals receiv￾ing both chronic homocysteine infusions and dipyridamole. The
animals weighed 10-12 kg and had hematocrits of 40±3%o,
leukocyte counts of 5,000±1,200/,pl, and platelet counts of
279,000+59,000/,l. They were free of tuberculosis, de￾wormed, and observed to be disease-free for at least 6 wk
before use. To facilitate continuous intravenous infusion and
repeated blood sampling, the animals were maintained in
restraining chairs during the period of observation. In addi￾tion, a femoral arteriovenous Silastic shunt was used, 0.24
cnm internal diameter and 25 cm in length, with Dacron
sewing cuffs at skin exit sites (12-14).
A solution of l-homocysteine (Aldrich Chemical Co., Inc.,
Milwaukee, Wis.) or a control solution alone was infused
continuously by femoral AV shunt throughout a 3-mo
period using a roller infusion pump (Holter pump, model
921, Extracorporeal Medical Specialties, Inc., King of
Prussia, Pa.) and a T-tube connector. 0.3 g of homocys￾teine per kg body weight was infused per day (3 g dis￾solved in 100 ml 0.15 M NaCl solution at pH 7.4 and
sterilized by filtration). The homocysteine infusion was
given at a rate of about 4 ml/h and produced plasma homo￾cystine levels of 0.1-0.2 mM due to the endogenous trans￾formation of homocysteine to homocystine. Homocystine
concentrations were measured each week. Platelet and
fibrinogen concentration, survival and turnover, were mea￾sured before and at monthly intervals during the infusion
period. Plasma cholesterol levels were obtained before the
infusion studies and before sacrifice.
Treatmentt. Dipyridamole was given orally to 11 animals
throughout the 3-mo period of homocysteine infusion in
doses of 30 mg/kg per day (in three divided doses). This
dose, which is a threefold increase over that used in the
acute studies (14), was required to normalize the platelet
consumption produced by the level of chronic homocystin￾emia used in this study.
Laboratory studies. Platelet counts were measured with
an electronic particle counter on peripheral blood collected
in EDTA by a previously described method (15, 16). The
mean platelet count of 50 normal baboons was 279,000±
59,000/pl (±1 SD). Platelet survival was determined from
the disappearance of radioactivity from blood sampled 5-10
times after injection of autologous 51Cr-labeled platelets
(14, 16). In this procedure 100 ml autologous whole blood
was collected directly into a plastic plasma pack (Fenwall
TA-6, Fenwall Laboratories, Inc., Morton Grove, Ill.) con￾taining 20 ml ACD anticoagulant, and centrifuged at 200 g
for 10 min at room temperature. The supernatant, platelet￾rich plasma was transferred to a second transfer bag by
a plasma extractor, and the pH was adjusted to 6.5 with
0.15 M citric acid (about 0.1 ml/10 ml plasma). Platelets
were then formed into a pellet by centrifuging at 3,000 9
for 15 min. The supernatant plasma was removed except
for 2-3 ml residual plasma into which the platelets were
carefully resuspended. This platelet suspension was then
incubated with 50 /LCi of radiochromium (New England
Nuclear, Boston, Mass.) for 20 min. About 40 ml nonradio￾active platelet-poor plasma and about 50 ml sterile air were
then added, and the pellet reformed by centrifuging at 3,000
g for 15 min. The residual radioactive platelet-poor plasma
was completely decanted without disturbing the pellet. 10 ml
nonradioactive platelet-poor plasma was carefully layered
over the platelet pellet and then discarded by decantation.
This maneuver washed the bag of more than 95% of the
residual nonplatelet-bound 5"Cr. The presence of air in the
bag facilitated this step by maintaining the overall con￾figuration of the bag during decantation. The labeled platelet
pellet was gently suspended in about 2 ml nonradioactive
platelet-poor plasma. Contaminating erythrocytes were
largely removed by a final slow centrifugation of 100 g
for 5 min. A known amount of 51Cr-labeled platelet sus￾pension was administered to the animal by intravenous in￾jection after the preparation of a standard. 3-ml samples of
whole blood, collected in EDTA twice daily for 3 days and
daily for an additional 3 days, were lysed with 0.1 ml
sodium dodecyl sulfate and counted for radioactivity in a
gamma spectrometer (Nuclear-Chicago, Des Plaines, Ill.).
Platelet survival time was determined by computer least
squares fitting to a gamma function as described by Paulus
(17) and Mlurphy et al. (18-20). The proportion of labeled
platelets remaining within the systemic circulation after in￾fusion (i.e., "recovery") was calculated from the platelet
activity per milliliter extrapolated to zero time, multiplied
by the estimated blood volume, and divided by the platelet
51Cr activity injected. Platelet consumption, measured as
platelet turnover per microliter of blood per day, was calcu￾lated from the peripheral platelet count divided by the
platelet survival time in days and corrected for recovery.
In 24 normal male baboons, platelet survival was 5.5±0.3
days. Platelet recovery averaged 85±5% and platelet turn￾over was 59,000±7,000 platelets/pl per day.
For calculating fibrinogen turnover, the concentration of
fibrinogen was estimated by a spectrophotometric method in
which the optical density of thrombin-clottable protein was
determined after collection on a glass rod and subsequent
solution in alkaline urea (21). The fibrinogen concentration
in 24 normal animals was 2.71±0.22 mg/ml. Labeling of
normal fibrinogen with "2I was performed by the method
of Takeda (22). This technique involved repeated precipi￾tation of fibrinogen with 257% ammonium sulfate saturation
followed by dissolving the precipitate in 0.005 M sodium
citrate, labeling with ['"I] Cl (monoiodochloride) and re￾moval of unbound "I. The solution was maintained at 4°C
for 1 h and then centrifuged at 20,000 g for 30 min at 4'C
to remove any cryoprecipitable material. It was sterilized
by filtration. In our preparations, the molar ratio of iodine
to fibrinogen was always less than 0.25; the fibrinogen was
95 % clottable (range, 92-98%). For survival measurements
sufficient labeled fibrinogen was prepared for several months
use. Individual doses were flash frozen and stored at - 85°C.
Survival did not change significantly during the time of
storage. Fibrinogen survival, determined from the half-time
disappearance and divided by the natural logarithm of 2,
averaged 2.6±0.2 days in 24 normal animals. Fibrinogen
turnover, used as a measure of fibrinogen consumption, was
calculated from the concentration of plasma fibrinogen
divided by its mean survival time. In 24 normal animals
fibrinogen turnover averaged 1.00±0.10 mg/ml per day.
Platelet function was measured by bleeding time, glass￾bead retention test, and aggregation induced by ADP (0.5,
1.0, 1.5, 2.0, and 10.0 ,uM final concentration), collagen (5
,g/ml), and epinephrine (2.5 Ag/ml). The bleeding time
was measured by the standardized template technique (23),
the mean value in 24 normal baboons was 4.0+1.2 min.
Platelet retention by glass-bead columns was measured by
the Bowie modification of the Salzman method (24), blood
being drawn by a two-syringe technique without anticoagu￾lant and immediately passed through the standard column
of beads by constant infusion at the rate of 2 ml/min. The
732 L. A. Harker, R. Ross, S. J. Slichter, and C. R. Scott

delay between drawing and initiation of flow through the
beads was less than 10 s. Platelet aggregation was esti￾mated from changes in optical transmission of 0.02 M
sodium citrated plasma at 37° C with a concentration of
300,000 platelets/pul (14, 25, 26). Plastic equipment was used
throughout, and plasma freshly drawn was kept at room
temperature during the 30-70 min before testing.
Homocystine was quantified by column chromatography
using a modified procedure of Spackman et al. (27).
Plasma samples were deproteinized by addition of an equal
volume of 6%o sulfosalicyclic acid buffered to pH 2. Homo￾cystine was separated on a 55-cm column of PA28 resin
(Beckman Instruments, Inc., Palo Alto, Calif.) with use
of 0.38 M sodium citrate buffer at pH 4.40. Temperature
was maintained at 62°C with a buffer flow rate of 60 ml/h
and the amino acid was eluted 62 min after addition of
buffer. Homocystine is not detectable in the plasma of
ncrmal animals.
Morphological procedures. Three types of vessel prepa￾ration were obtained: (a) lower abdominal aorta, iliac and
femoral arteries for light and electron microscopic examina￾tion of lesion formation; (b) carotid arteries for [3H]thy￾midine incorporation by endothelial cells; (c) thoracic and
upper abdominal aorta for silver stain quantitation of endo￾thelial coverage. Specimens were obtained under general
(halothane) anesthesia and assisted respiration in the fol￾lowing way. After opening the abdomen, the aorta and
inferior vena cava were carefully freed by sharp dissection
without affecting flow. The inferior vena cava was then
cannulated to establish isolated venous drainage from the
lower limbs and immediately thereafter the aorta was can￾nulated, flushed free of blood elements with 5%o glucose
solution at 100 mm Hg of hydrostatic pressure, and perfuse￾fixed with buffered half-strength Karnovsky's fixative (28)
under 100 mm Hg pressure for 20 min in vivo. Once per￾fusion fixation of the distal arteries was underway, the
carotid arteries were freed by sharp dissection, isolated, and
carefully removed. The artery segments were gently flushed
free of blood with saline, and excess adventitia removed
for [3H]thymidine studies. Immediately after removing the
carotid arteries, the chest was entered (thereby interrupting
respiration), the arch of the aorta quickly cannulated, and
drainage outflow was established above the renal arteries.
The aorta was then cleared of blood using 5% glucose
solution at 100 mm Hg pressure. In vivo fixation was then
carried out by perfusion-fixation of the thoracic and upper
abdominal aorta with 0.3%o silver nitrate solution at a
pressure of 100 mm Hg for 20 min (29). After perfusion￾fixation, the vessels were removed by sharp dissection. The
foregoing- procedure ensured the procurement of three dif￾ferent artery preparations from a single living animal while
using isolated regional pressure-perfusion fixation.
Initimal lesion score. At the time of sacrifice the aorta
was cannulated below the renal vessels, flushed free of blood
with 5% glucose solution, and then perfuse-fixed with
buffered half-strength Karnovsky's fixative (28) under 100
mm Hg hydrostatic pressure for 20 min in vivo. Vessels
were subsequently removed by sharp dissection and placed
in half-strength Karnovsky's fixative for 6 h at 4°C. Seg￾ments from abdominal aorta, and each iliac artery were
removed for scanning electron micrographs. The remaining
vascular tissues were subsequently cut into approximately
1-mm rings and returned to the fixative for another hour
at 4°C. They were then washed in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer
containing 0.2 M sucrose (pH 7.3) and subsequently post￾fixed in lgo osmium tetroxide buffered with s-collidine or
with phosphate buffer (pH 7.3) for 11 h, followed by en
bloc staining with 2% uranyl acetate for i h. After em￾bedding in epoxy resin, 1-,um thick sections were cut as
circles, and stained with a combination of basic fuchsin
and azure II-methylene blue for light microscopy (30).
Selected thin sections were cut at approximately 800 A
thickness for transmission electron microscopy. These sec￾tions were stained with lead citrate followed by uranyl
acetate. All of the sections for electron microscopy were
examined in an AEI801 electron microscope (AEI Scien￾tific Apparatus Inc., Elmsford, N. Y.).
Five random sections were prepared for each of five
vessels (abdominal aorta, right and left iliac arteries, right
and left femoral arteries) for light microscopic scoring of
intimal lesions. The lesions were graded by two observers
in a 'blind' manner according to the cell layer depth of inti￾mal smooth muscle cells: grade 0-only occasional intimal
smooth muscle cells; grade 1-1-5 cells deep; grade 2-6-10
cells; grade 3-11-15 cells; grade 4-16-20 cells; grade
5- > 20 cells deep. The overall score was calculated for
each animal by summing the scores of all 25 sections exam￾ined (possible range of scores was 0-125).
[3H] Thymidine labelintg intdex. Both carotid arteries
were removed by sharp dissection, flushed with saline, and
cut into 20-mm lengths. Whole segments were placed in 3-4
ml medium TC 199 containing 1 /Ci ['H]thymidine/ml and
incubated at 37°C for 4 h. The vessel segments were re￾moved, trimmed, opened longitudinally, and mounted flat for
fixing 24 h in 10%o neutral buffered formaldehyde (31). The
endothelium was prepared for autoradiography by the method
of Schwartz and Benditt (32) which involved the following
procedures. The luminal surface of the specimen was em￾bedded in collodion onto a slide leaving the adventitial
surface exposed. The adventitial surface was then embedded
in gelatin and bonded to a gelatin-coated slide by fixation
with formaldehyde while the specimen and the coated slide
were held together under pressure. Subsequently the col￾lodion overlying the endothelial cells was removed with
ether and alcohol thereby exposing the luminal surface of
endothelial cells for coating with autoradiographic emulsion.
Autoradiography was performed by hand dipping endothelial
mounts in Kodak NTB-2 emulsion, 2-wk exposure, followed
by Kodak D-19 developer and rapid fixer (Eastman Kodak
Co., Rochester, N. Y.). The preparations were stained with
Harris' hematoxylin and mounted.
About 80%o of the mounts were complete, containing over
90%o of the endothelial cells intact and countable. All of
the endothelial cells from each mount, i.e., 15,000 cells each,
were scored as labeled or unlabeled, and the [3H]thymidine
labeling index represented the ratio of these values ex￾pressed as a percentage.
Entdothelial cell loss. Pressure-perfusion fixation was
carried out on the thoracic and upper abdominal aorta with
0.3%o silver nitrate solution at the time of sacrifice in vivo.
The entire endovascular surface of whole-aorta mounts was
then examined morphometrically by means of a grid micro￾meter, and the proportion of the surface not covered by
endothelial cells was determined.
RESULTS

completely intact (Fig. la) in the eight control animals
when the vessels were prepared by pressure-perfusion
fixation in vivo using either 0.3% AgNO3 staining or

When viewed by scanning electron microscopy, platelets
were found to accumulate at some sites of endothelial

of 15 homocystinemic animals averaged 9.6±2.2% 1 of

In the 11 homocystinemic animals treated with oral
dipyridamole (30 mg/kg per day), 7.0+0.9% of the
aortic endothelial cells was absent with a mean plasma
homocystine concentration before sacrifice of 0.13±0.01
mM (Table I). The relationship between homocystine
level and endothelial cell desquamation was not changed
by dipyridamole treatment (P > 0.75).
Platelet consumption. Platelet survival in the homo￾cystinemic animals was reduced to 2.8±0.3 days com￾pared with 5.4±0.1 days in the control group (Table I).
Reciprocally, platelet turnover was increased threefold
in the homocystinemic animals, i.e., 183,000+17,000
platelets/isl per day compared with 63,000+4,000 plate￾lets/,*l per day in the control group. Platelet survival
times were related to the logarithm of the homocystine
concentration (Fig. 4A). r = 0.965, P < 0.001, and the
regression line was represented by y = 0.453e'-'.
Determinations of platelet survival also correlated
with the logarithm of aortic endothelial cell loss (Fig.
4B). r = 0.958, P < 0.001, and the regression line was
represented by y = 44.0ez'7.
Platelet survival times were significantly prolonged
by dipyridamole treatment (4.8+0.2 days compared with
2.8±0.3 days, P < 0.001) despite continued homocystin￾emia (Fig. 4A and 4B). Platelet turnover was also
returned to near normal values (Table I, P < 0.001).
In homocystinemic animals fibrinogen survival and
turnover were not changed significantly from control
values, i.e., 2.4±0.2 days and 1.2±0.2 mg/ml per day,
respectively, compared with 2.5±0.2 days and 1.1 mg/
ml per day in control animals. Fibrinogen kinetics were
not altered by dipyridamole treatment (2.4+0.2 days
and 1.3±0.3 mg/ml per day, respectively).
Platelet aggregation to ADP, epinephrine, and col￾lagen was not significantly different in six dipyrida￾mole-treated animals compared with six untreated homo￾cystinemic animals. Similarly, the bleeding time was
not significantly prolonged by dipyridamole therapy
(4.8+2.5 min compared with 4.2±2.0 min). However,
dipyridamole treatment reduced platelet retention by
glass-bead columns from 43±12% retained in homo￾cystinemic animals to 26±9% in treated animals (P
<0.05).
Endothelial cell regeneration. In control animals the
['H]thymidine-labeling index of endothelial cells aver￾aged 0.0011+0.0001%. Animals with induced homocys￾tinemia showed a greater than 25-fold increase in the
endothelial cells incorporating ['H]thymidine, i.e.,
0.0296+0.0087%, P < 0.001. Dipyridamole-treated ani￾mals had a 15-fold increase in [3H]thymidine-labeling
index (0.0162±0.0051%, P < 0.001).
Intimal lesion formation. For every animal studied,
five random sections from each of five different arteries
were graded 0-5 (see Methods). Single intimal smooth
muscle cells were occasionally observed in control ani￾mals (Fig. 5, scores averaged 4±1, range 1-9).
All of the homocystinemic animals developed eccentric
fibromusculoelastic lesions (Fig. 6). 5-10% of the pro￾liferation regions contained intracellular lipid or foam

The fine structure of the lesions (Fig. 9) was typical
of early lesion formation similar to the fibromusculo￾elastic lesions in man (9). They demonstrated the pres￾ence of numerous smooth muscle cells surrounded by
large amounts of small collagen fibers and elastic fibers
rich in microfibrils, suggesting that the elastic fibers

luminal surface of the lesions had no endothelial cell
cover, while in other regions cells appeared to be in the
process of attempting to cover the surface.
Effect of dipyridamole on intimal lesion formation.
In the group of 11 animals receiving oral dipyridamole
throughout the 3-mo period of homocystinemia, the
mean intimal lesion score was 16±2 (range 7-25),
compared with 4±1 in control animals and 63±5 in
untreated homocystinemic animals (Figs. 7 and 8, Table
II). The difference in the intimal lesion scores between
the dipyridamole-treated and untreated homocystinemic

measurable deficiencies in endothelial cell coverage at
lower homocystine concentrations may be explained
by compensatory coverage achieved by increased endo￾thelial regeneration (Table I).
Although we find no evidence to implicate hypercho￾lesterolemia or hypertriglyceridemia in homocystine￾induced lesions, the importance of lipids in the genesis
of atherosclerosis has long been emphasized (4) but
poorly understood. Clearly, lipid accumulation, both
within the smooth muscle cells and in the surrounding
matrix, is important in preventing lesion regression

by a wide variety of pharmacologic agents (50, 51, 57-
59). These include a group of nonsteroidal anti-inflam￾matory drugs such as acetylsalicylic acid and sulfinpy￾razone. Although their mode of action has not yet been
fully determined, these drugs characteristically inhibit
the platelet release reaction and the secondary phase of
ADP or epinephrine-induced aggregation with little or
no effect on primary ADP aggregation. These drugs
appear to be less useful for interrupting adhesion-re￾lated effects, e.g., acetylsalicylic acid fails to reduce the
adhesion and degranulation of platelets to subendothel￾ium (53). Correlation between in vitro effects on plate￾let function tests and in vivo antithrombotic effects is
variable. For example, in man treatment with sulfinpy￾razone normalizes platelet survival and reduces thrombus
formation without showing any measurable effect on in
vitro tests of platelet function (60).
A second group of drugs, the pyrimido-pyrimidine
compounds, inhibits both primary and secondary ADP￾or epinephrine-induced aggregation and platelet release,
aggregation induced by thrombin or collagen, and plate￾let retention by glass-bead columns. These drugs appear
to affect platelet cAMP by enhancing adenylcyclase and
inhibiting phosphodiesterase activity (50, 51, 57-59).
Included in this class of agents is dipyridamole. Inter￾estingly, dipyridamole interrupts platelet consumption
and thromboembolism in man at concentrations that do
not effect platelet function tests in vitro (61, 62). This
discrepancy between in vivo and in vitro effects is
further evidenced by a recent comparison of in vivo
and in vitro collagen-induced platelet aggregation that
showed the inhibitory effect of dipyridamole in vivo to
be enhanced many times over that observed in vitro
(63).
Consideration must be given to the possibility that
dipyridamole may have produced its beneficial effect on
lesion formation by protecting the endothelium from
injury, by modifying the thrombogenicity of the sub￾endothelium, or by inhibiting the proliferation of smooth
muscle cells. The data in Table I and Fig. 1 indicate
that homocystine-induced endothelial cell loss remained
quantitatively unchanged by dipyridamole therapy. The
drug therefore appears to have no protective effect on
the endothelium. Furthermore, smooth muscle cell pro￾liferation also appears to be unaffected because smooth
muscle cells proliferate normally in culture with dipyrid￾amole concentrations as great as 10 M (unpublished
observation). Since the only measurable effect of dipy￾ridamole appears to be on platelet consumption, we con￾clude that the drug effect is mediated through platelet￾related mechanisms. Our observation that dipyridamole￾treated animals show reduced platelet retention by glass￾bead columns suggests that the effect involves pharma￾cologic inhibition of platelet function rather than some
alteration of the subendothelial surface.
On the basis of these studies we conclude that sus￾tained chemically induced endothelial cell injury results
in endothelial cell loss followed by platelet adherence
and release and the development of progressive intimal
arteriosclerotic lesions. The fundamental role of plate￾lets in the genesis of these lesions is demonstrated by
the capacity of an inhibitor of platelet function to pre￾vent intimal smooth muscle proliferation, and conse￾quent lesion formation. These observations imply po￾tential therapeutic benefit of antiplatelet drugs in the
prevention or interruption of atherogenesis in man.
