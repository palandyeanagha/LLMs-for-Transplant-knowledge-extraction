A genetic variant in PNPLA3 (PNPLA3I148M), a triacylglycerol (TAG) hydrolase, is a major risk factor for non￾alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD); however, the mechanism underlying this association is not known. To 
develop an animal model of PNPLA3-induced fatty liver disease, we generated transgenic mice that overex￾press similar amounts of wild-type PNPLA3 (PNPLA3WT) or mutant PNPLA3 (PNPLA3I148M) either in liver 
or adipose tissue. Overexpression of the transgenes in adipose tissue did not affect liver fat content. Expres￾sion of PNPLA3I148M, but not PNPLA3WT, in liver recapitulated the fatty liver phenotype as well as other 
metabolic features associated with this allele in humans. Metabolic studies provided evidence for 3 distinct 
alterations in hepatic TAG metabolism in PNPLA3I148M transgenic mice: increased formation of fatty acids 
and TAG, impaired hydrolysis of TAG, and relative depletion of TAG long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids. 
These findings suggest that PNPLA3 plays a role in remodeling TAG in lipid droplets, as they accumulate in 
response to food intake, and that the increase in hepatic TAG levels associated with the I148M substitution 
results from multiple changes in hepatic TAG metabolism. The development of an animal model that reca￾pitulates the metabolic phenotype of the allele in humans provides a new platform in which to elucidate the 
role of PNLPA3I148M in NAFLD.
Introduction
Higher organisms stockpile triacylglycerol (TAG) in adipose tis￾sue as a buffer against fluctuations in food availability and energy 
demands. TAG is usually maintained at much lower concentrations 
in other tissues. In several species, including migratory birds, mice, 
and humans, sustained caloric excess causes TAG to accumulate in 
nonadipose tissues, particularly liver (1, 2). In humans, the propen￾sity to accumulate hepatic TAG varies widely among individuals: 
hepatic TAG content ranges from <1% to >50% of liver weight (3). 
Several factors are associated with an increase in liver TAG content, 
including obesity, insulin resistance, and alcohol ingestion, but 
the factors responsible for the wide interindividual differences in 
hepatic TAG levels have not been fully elucidated (4, 5).
In 2008, we identified a missense sequence variation (I148M) 
in patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing 3 (PNPLA3, 
alternatively referred to as adiponutrin) (6) that is associated with 
increased hepatic TAG content (7). Homozygotes for the variant 
allele (148M) have a 2-fold higher hepatic TAG content than do 
homozygotes for the wild-type allele (148I). The 148M variant has 
been shown to be associated with the full spectrum of nonalco￾holic fatty liver disease (NAFLD): hepatic steatosis, steatohepatitis, 
cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (8–17). Moreover, among 
alcoholics, the risk of developing cirrhosis is increased 3.5- to 
4-fold in homozygotes for the 148M variant (14, 18, 19). These 
findings are consistent with PNPLA3 playing a role in metabolism 
of hepatic TAG, but the normal physiologic role of the enzyme and 
how the 148M isoform causes liver disease remain obscure.
PNPLA3 belongs to a family of proteins that share a domain 
that was first identified in patatin, a major soluble protein of 
potato tubers with nonspecific acyl hydrolase activity (20). The 
domain differs from classical lipases by employing a catalytic dyad 
(Ser-Asp), rather than a catalytic triad, to effect hydrolysis (21). 
PNPLA3 is expressed primarily in liver and adipose tissue, in which 
it partitions to membranes and lipid droplets (22). Biochemical 
studies using purified recombinant human PNPLA3 indicate that 
the enzyme hydrolyzes acylglycerols (monoacylglycerols, diacyl￾glycerols [DAGs], and TAGs) with first-order Michaelis-Menten 
kinetics but has little to no activity against phospholipids (23). 
The I148M substitution markedly reduces acylglycerol hydro￾lase activity, decreasing the Vmax of the enzyme, without reducing 
substrate affinity. These findings are consistent with a structural 
model of the patatin domain of PNPLA3, in which the substitu￾tion of methionine for isoleucine at residue 148 blocks access of 
substrate to the catalytic serine (22). Thus, the in vitro data sug￾gest that the enzyme normally functions as an acylglycerol hydro￾lase and that the I148M substitution causes a loss of hydrolytic 
function, resulting in accumulation of excess TAG.
Data from genetically manipulated mice are difficult to reconcile 
with a loss-of-function model. Inactivation of Pnpla3 in mice does 
not result in any change in hepatic TAG content (24, 25), even when 
the mice are challenged with a high-sucrose diet. In addition, over￾expression of wild-type PNPLA3 by adenoviral transgenesis does 
not reduce liver TAG levels (22). Conversely, adenovirus-mediated 
overexpression of PNPLA3I148M in mouse liver causes an increase 
in hepatic TAG content, which is more consistent with the I148M 
substitution conferring a gain of function (22). Recently, Kumari et 
al. (26) reported that PNPLA3 had lysophosphatidic acid acyltrans￾ferase (LPAAT) activity and that the I148M substitution increases

rather than decreases this activity, suggesting that the I148M vari￾ant may cause hepatic steatosis by increasing TAG synthesis.
The regulation of PNPLA3 also suggests that the enzyme plays 
a role in lipid anabolism, rather than catabolism. The protein is 
highly regulated by nutritional stimuli at both the transcriptional 
and posttranslational levels (27, 28). Regulation is coordinated by 
the transcription factors liver X receptor (LXR) and SREBP-1c (28). 
During fasting, low levels of SREBP-1c result in low transcription 
of PNPLA3 mRNA and efficient degradation of PNPLA3 protein, 
ensuring very low levels of PNPLA3 in the liver. With carbohydrate 
refeeding, insulin upregulates SREBP-1c, which in turn stimu￾lates PNPLA3 transcription and concomitantly upregulates fatty 
acid biosynthesis. Endogenously synthesized fatty acids retard the 
degradation of PNPLA3 protein, leading to a marked postprandial 
rebound in PNPLA3 levels (28). Thus, PNPLA3 is upregulated when 
the liver is synthesizing TAG and sequestering it in lipid droplets.
To elucidate the mechanism by which the PNPLA3I148M variant 
confers susceptibility to fatty liver disease, we sought to develop 
an animal model that recapitulates the human phenotype asso￾ciated with this allele. Since deletion of Pnpla3 in mice does not 
lead to increased liver fat content (24, 25), we developed trans￾genic mice that overexpress either wild-type or mutant (148M) 
human PNPLA3 in liver or in adipose tissue. Experiments were 
designed to address three fundamental questions. First, does the 
increased hepatic fat associated with the 148M variant result from 
the action(s) of the mutant allele in liver or in fat? Second, does 
the 148M variant promote the accretion or retard the degradation 
of hepatic TAG? Third, PNPLA3 has acyltransferase activity (29), 
and it has been speculated that the enzyme plays a role in TAG 
remodeling. Does expression of the 148M variant alter the spec￾trum of TAG species in the liver? Here, we show that overexpres￾sion of wild-type PNPLA3 in liver or in adipose tissue did not alter 
the total TAG content of either tissue, whereas overexpression of 
mutant PNPLA3 in liver, but not in adipose tissue, altered the level 
and composition of hepatic TAGs.
Results
Development of transgenic mice expressing human PNPLA3 (PNPLA3WT
and PNPLA3I148M) in liver and adipose tissue. Lines of PNPLA3 trans￾genic mice in a C57BL/6J background were established that 
express wild-type human PNPLA3 (PNPLA3WT) or the 148M 
variant (PNPLA3I148M) in liver or in adipose tissue (L-PNPLA3WT
and L-PNPLA3I148M or A-PNPLA3WT and A-PNPLA3I148M). Liver￾specific expression was obtained by placing the transgenes under 
control of a liver-specific enhancer/promoter of ApoE (30). Two 
liver-specific lines expressing similar levels of hepatic wild-type 
and mutant mRNA and protein (PNPLA3WT and PNPLA3I148M, 
respectively) were selected for study (Figure 1A). Expression of 
both transgenes was largely confined to the liver. Low levels of 
PNPLA3 mRNA were detected in the lungs of the PNPLA3WT trans￾genic mice and in the brain, heart, kidney, lung, and spleen of the 
PNPLA3I148M transgenic mice. Within the liver, more than 95% of 
the PNPLA3 protein was located in lipid droplets in both lines of 
mice (Supplemental Figure 1; for uncut gels see Supplemental 
Material; supplemental material available online with this article; 
doi:10.1172/JCI65179DS1), and within the lipid droplet fractions 
from the 2 lines the levels of PNPLA3 were similar (Figure 1A). The 
antibody used in this experiment recognizes human PNPLA3 and 
not mouse PNPLA3. Perilipin 2 (PLIN2), a lipid droplet protein, 
was used as a loading control. Transgenic mouse lines express￾ing wild-type and mutant human PNPLA3 in adipose tissue were 
generated by expressing the human PNPLA3 cDNAs under con￾trol of the aP2 promoter (ref. 31 and Figure 1B). As expected, the 
major site of expression of both transgenes was in adipose tissue. 
Expression levels of PNPLA3 were 3-fold higher in brown fat than 
in white fat (Figure 1B), which is similar to the expression pattern 
seen with this promoter in other transgenic lines (32, 33). Similar 
levels of PNPLA3 were present in the lipid droplets in the adipose 
tissues of the 2 transgenic mouse lines (Figure 1B).
Expression of PNPLA3I148M in liver, but not adipose tissue, causes increased 
liver TAG. To assess the effect of hepatic PNPLA3 expression on the 
amount and distribution of neutral lipid in the liver, sections from 
the livers of 12-week-old chow-fed male mice were subjected to Oil 
Red O staining (Figure 2A). Lipid droplets in the livers of PNPLA3WT
transgenic mice were similar in size and distribution to those of 
wild-type animals, whereas mice expressing the 148M variant had an 
increase in both the number (0.42 ± 0.05/μm2 vs. 0.20 ± 0.03/μm2) 
and the size (0.098 μm2 vs. 0.055 μm2) of lipid droplets when com￾pared with those of the wild-type transgenic mice. The increased 
neutral lipid content of livers from PNPLA3I148M transgenic mice 
was confirmed biochemically (Figure 2A): TAG and cholesteryl 
esters were both increased 1.8-fold in the PNPLA3I148M transgenic 
mice when compared with those in the PNPLA3WT transgenic mice, 
but the absolute increase in the mass of TAG was much greater than 
that of cholesteryl esters (10 mg/g vs. 0.15 mg/g). Similar results 
were obtained using an independent line of PNPLA3I148M transgenic 
mice (data not shown). Hepatic TAG levels tended to be lower in 
PNPLA3WT transgenic mice than in their nontransgenic littermate 
controls, but the differences did not reach statistical significance 
in 3 independent experiments. No significant differences in hepat￾ic levels of free cholesterol or phosphatidylcholine were apparent 
among the 3 lines of mice. Plasma levels of lipids and liver enzymes 
(aspartate transaminase [AST] and alanine transaminase [ALT]) did 
not differ among the 3 lines of chow-fed mice (Supplemental Figure 
2A). Increased hepatic TAG content is often accompanied by insulin 
resistance, but no differences in plasma glucose levels were detected 
after fasting or in response to glucose or insulin challenges (Supple￾mental Figure 2B). Nor were any inter-line differences found in the 
relative amounts of phosphorylated AKT (Supplemental Figure 
2C) in the liver. Serum levels of insulin also did not differ between 
the lines (Supplemental Figure 2D). Thus, the metabolic sequelae 
of overexpressing PNPLA3I148M in livers of mice mirror the pheno￾type associated with the variant in humans (i.e., increased liver TAG 
content, without changes in plasma lipids or insulin sensitivity) (7).
Overexpression of PNPLA3I148M in adipose tissue did not affect 
the lipid content of the liver (Figure 2B). Expression of wild-type or 
mutant PNPLA3 in adipose tissue was not associated with changes 
in fat cell morphology (Figure 2B), body weight, or distribution of 
body fat (Supplemental Figure 3A) or in plasma levels of lipids, glu￾cose, or fatty acids (Supplemental Figure 3B). No significant chang￾es in levels of expression of genes that regulate TAG metabolism 
were seen in either brown or white adipose tissue (BAT or WAT) 
(Supplemental Figure 3C). Recently, it was reported that PNPLA3
mRNA levels are reduced in adipose tissue of rats exposed to the 
cold (34). To test whether overexpression of PNPLA3 in adipose tis￾sue affects temperature control or response to cold exposure, body 
temperature was monitored in mice maintained at a temperature 
of 4°C for up to 3 hours. The reductions in body temperature of 
the transgenic lines were similar to those seen in the wild-type mice 
(Supplemental Figure 3D). Thus, we did not observe any effect

of overexpressing PNPLA3 in adipose tissue on TAG or fatty acid 
metabolism in liver or adipose tissue. Accordingly, subsequent 
studies were performed only in the 2 lines of liver-specific trans￾genic mice, which are referred to as PNPLA3WT and PNPLA3I148M, 
and their nontransgenic littermates.
Dietary composition affects accumulation of hepatic TAG in PNPLA3I148M
mice. Hepatic TAG levels are strongly influenced by dietary carbo￾hydrate and fat content. To determine the effect of dietary com￾position on the accumulation of hepatic fat in the wild-type and 
mutant transgenic mice, mice were fed a high-sucrose diet (58% 
sucrose, 0% fat) for 6 weeks. Hepatic TAG levels increased 3-fold in 
the PNPLA3I148M transgenic mice when compared with PNPLA3WT
transgenic mice or nontransgenic controls (Figure 3A). An increase 
of similar magnitude was seen in cholesteryl ester levels in these 
mice. Mice were also challenged with a high-fat diet (45% animal fat). 
Hepatic TAG levels were increased to high levels in all the mice, but 
no differences were found between the lines, even when the diet was 
continued for 12 weeks (Figure 3B). The divergent responses to the 
2 diets were not attributable to differences between the lines in body 
weight accrual or in body composition (Supplemental Figure 4). 
Plasma levels of lipids, fasting glucose, ketone bodies, nonesterified 
fatty acids (NEFAs), and liver enzymes did not differ between the 
lines on the different diets (Supplemental Figure 5).
Effect of PNPLA3I148M on hepatic TAG metabolism. Liver TAG accumu￾lation may be caused by increased TAG accrual or decreased TAG 
removal. To determine the effect of PNPLA3 expression on hepatic

droplets isolated from the livers (22). A total of 1% of the volume of each fraction was size fractionated on an 8% SDS-PAGE gel and probed 
using a polyclonal anti-human PNPLA3 antibody (22). PLIN2, a lipid droplet protein, was used as a loading control. (B) Schematic diagram of the

TAG synthesis, 3H-glycerol was injected intraperitoneally into non￾transgenic and PNPLA3WT and PNPLA3I148M transgenic mice and 
the hepatic incorporation into TAG was measured 30 minutes later 
(Figure 4A and ref. 35). No differences in rates of incorporation of 
3H-glycerol into TAG were seen among the 3 lines (Figure 4A). The 
experiment was repeated using primary hepatocytes from the mice. 
After 2 hours in culture, cells were incubated in medium contain￾ing 0.6 mM oleate plus 14C-glycerol (Figure 4B). Incorporation of 
label into TAG was monitored for 4 hours, and no significant dif￾ferences were observed among the lines.
Previous studies have indicated that a majority of the glycerol in 
hepatic TAG derives from glyceroneogenesis and thus would not

3 times (n = 4–5 mice/group), and results were similar.

be traced by exogenously administered glycerol (36). To avoid arti￾facts due to the choice of label, the experiments were repeated using 
14C-acetate (Figure 4C) and 14C-oleate (Figure 4D). Essentially 
identical results were obtained with all 3 labels. Since recombinant 
bacterial PNPLA3 was recently shown to have LPAAT activity in 
vitro (26), we also compared incorporation of 14C-oleoyl CoA into 
phosphatidic acid (PA) in hepatic membranes and lipid droplets 
isolated from the mice: no differences were found among the lines 
(Figure 4E). Taken together, these data suggest that the increased 
TAG accumulation in livers of PNPLA3I148M transgenic mice cannot 
be attributed solely to an increase in hepatic TAG synthesis.
A major pathway for removal of TAG from liver is via secre￾tion as a constituent of VLDLs. To assay the loss of hepatic TAG 
via this pathway, we inhibited lipolysis of newly secreted VLDL 
using Triton WR-1339 and measured accumulation of TAG in 
the blood over time (37). The rate of increase in plasma TAG lev￾els did not differ among the 3 lines (Figure 5A). The experiment 
was repeated after feeding a high-sucrose diet, and the results 
were similar (data not shown). Thus, the increase in hepatic TAG 
in these mice appears not to be caused by defective secretion of 
VLDL from the liver.
To examine the possibility that PNPLA3I148M impedes TAG 
hydrolysis, we incubated primary hepatocytes from wild-type and 
transgenic mice in 0.6 mM oleate plus 14C-glycerol for 4 hours 
to label cellular TAG. As shown previously, similar amounts of 
14C-glycerol were incorporated into TAG among the mouse lines 
using this protocol (Figure 4B). Triacsin C, an inhibitor of acyl￾CoA synthase, was then added to the medium to inhibit incorpo￾ration of 14C-acyl-CoA into TAG (38). Cells were washed, and the 
rate of TAG hydrolysis was determined by monitoring the release 
of 14C-glycerol into the medium (Figure 5B). In 4 separate experi￾ments, glycerol release was lower in hepatocytes expressing the 
148M transgene than the wild-type transgene.
We also measured the rates of fatty acid oxidation in primary 
hepatocytes from the 3 lines of mice. No differences in O2 consump￾tion were apparent among the lines, either at baseline or after addi￾tion of palmitate. As a positive control for this experiment, we inhibit￾ed fatty acid oxidation using etomoxir (39); as expected, a reduction in 
fatty acid oxidation was seen in the etomoxir-treated cells (Figure 5C).
Effect of PNPLA3I148M on expression of genes involved in hepatic lipid 
metabolism and inflammation. We measured and compared levels of 
selected mRNAs that encode proteins involved in transcriptional 
regulation of hepatic lipids, hepatic fatty acid and TAG synthe￾sis, oxidation, and cholesterol metabolism in the 3 lines of mice 
(Figure 6). For these experiments, the mice were maintained on a 
chow diet. Expression of the transgenes did not affect the hepatic 
mRNA expression levels of mouse Pnpla3 or of Atgl, the patatin 
family member that is most closely related to PNPLA3. Although 
no increases in mRNA levels were seen for SREBP-1c or SREBP-2, 
several SREBP-1c target genes were significantly increased in the 
PNPLA3I148M transgenic mice compared with the PNPLA3WT trans￾genic mice, including Acc2, Fas, Scd1, Acly, and Elovl6. No increase 
was found in the mRNA levels of SREBP-2 target genes, including 
Hmgcs1 and Hmgcr. Levels of mRNAs that are frequently increased 
in mouse models of hepatic steatosis were also increased in liv￾ers of the PNPLA3I148M transgenic mice, including monoacylg￾lycerol O-acyltransferase 1 (MGAT1) (40), adipsin (Cfd) (41), and 
cell death–inducing DFFA-like effector C (Cidec) (42). The mRNA 
levels of Tnfa, Col1a1, and Acta2, which are increased in association 
with hepatic inflammation and fibrosis (43), were not increased 
in these animals. Similar results were observed in mice fed a high￾sucrose diet (data not shown). Interestingly, no increase in SREBP￾1c target genes were seen in the transgenic PNPLA3I148M mice fed 
a high-fat diet; as noted above, a high-fat diet abolishes the dif￾ferences in liver TAG levels between PNPLA3WT and PNPLA3I148M
transgenic mice (Supplemental Figure 6).

high-fat (45% fat) diet for 12 weeks. Mice were killed and livers were collected after a 4-hour fast. Liver lipids were extracted and quantitated using 
enzymatic assays, as described in Methods. Values are mean ± SEM (n = 5/group). Levels were compared among lines of mice using Student’s 
t test. *P < 0.05,**P < 0.001. The experiment was performed twice (n = 5/group), and results were similar.

Increased incorporation of tritium into fatty acids and TAG in 
PNPLA3I148M transgenic mice. The increased levels of mRNA encod￾ing several enzymes involved in fatty acid synthesis prompted us 
to measure hepatic fatty acid synthesis in vivo by monitoring the 
incorporation of tritium from 3H-H2O into fatty acids, as previ￾ously described (35, 44). For these experiments, the lipids were 
saponified prior to extraction to release fatty acids. The experiment 
was performed in chow-fed animals and in animals that were fed 
a high-sucrose diet for 1 week prior to the injection of label; the 
results were similar. Fatty acid labeling was increased in the 2 lines 
of transgenic mice (Figure 7) when compared with that in the con￾trol animals. Incorporation was not significantly different between 
the 2 transgenic lines, although inter-mouse variability may have 
reduced the power to detect small differences between these groups. 
We also examined the incorporation of the tritium into PA, DAG, 
and TAG. No significant differences were observed in PA and DAG. 
The incorporation into TAG increased progressively from wild-type 
mice to PNPLA3WT transgenic mice to PNPLA3I148M transgenic 
mice but reached statistical significance only in the PNPLA3I148M
transgenic mice. Thus, we found an increase in TAG synthesis using 
tritium-labeled water in vivo but not when we used either oleate or 
glycerol as a label in mice or in cultured hepatocytes. The different 
results obtained from the experiments using tritiated water in mice 
and those using glycerol in mice and acetate, oleate, or glycerol in 
cells may reflect dedifferentiation of the hepatocytes when placed 
in culture and differences in the biochemical pathways by which 
the different labels are incorporated (see Discussion).
No differences in phospholipid composition among the 3 lines. The major 
classes of phospholipids were measured by liquid chromatogra￾phy (LC) and tandem mass spectrometry (MS) using internal stan￾dards (45, 46). No differences were found in the composition of 
major phospholipid classes in the livers of the 3 lines of mice, even 
after a high-sucrose diet to maximize the steatosis (Table 1). The 
PAs, lysophosphatidic acids (LPAs), and DAGs were also measured 
in an independent laboratory using LC/quadrupole orthogonal 
time-of-flight (Figure 8A). The LPA levels were lower in the 2 trans￾genic lines than in the controls, but the differences were not sta￾tistically significant. The hepatic PA and DAG levels were similar 
among the 3 lines.
Relative depletion of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids in the TAG of 
the PNPLA3I148M transgenic mice. To determine the effect of PNPLA3 
on hepatic TAG–fatty acid composition, gas chromatography was 
used to measure and compare the distribution of fatty acids in the 
hepatic TAG of the 3 lines of mice (Figure 8B). Among the more 
abundant fatty acids, there were no significant differences in the 
relative abundance of palmitate (16:0), whereas the ratios of C16:1 
and C18:1 fatty acids to total TAG–fatty acids were higher and 
that of C18:2 fatty acids to total TAG–fatty acids was lower in the 
PNPLA3I148M transgenic line than in the other 2 lines. Among the 
less abundant fatty acids, there was a relative depletion of many of 
the long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids in the hepatic TAGs of 
the PNPLA3I148M transgenic mice when compared with those of 
the PNPLA3WT transgenic or nontransgenic mice. These data indi￾cate that expression of PNPLA3I148M in the liver leads to a relative 
increase in monounsaturated fatty acids and depletion of long￾chain and very-long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids.
Discussion
The major finding of this study is that transgenic mice overex￾pressing PNPLA3I148M in the liver recapitulate the fatty liver pheno￾type as well as other metabolic features associated with this allele 
in humans. Expression of the 148M allele in mice did not increase 
body weight or body fat content and was not associated with the 
adverse metabolic sequelae that often accompany fatty liver, such 
as insulin resistance or hypertriglyceridemia (2, 47). These results 
parallel the lack of association between the I148M polymorphism 
and BMI, insulin resistance, or plasma TAG levels observed in 
humans (7, 11, 16) and suggest that the metabolic mechanisms 
by which the 148M allele promotes liver fat accumulation may be 
similar in mice and humans. Metabolic studies in the transgenic 
mice revealed that high level expression of PNPLA3I148M in the 
liver, but not in adipose tissue, affected both hepatic TAG synthe￾Figure 5

sis and catabolism. A surprising finding was that the PNPLA3I148M
transgenic mice have significantly increased fatty acid synthesis 
and an altered spectrum of TAG–fatty acids in the liver, with no 
evidence of insulin resistance.
The finding that hepatic TAG levels are normal in mice lacking 
(24, 25) or overexpressing wild-type PNPLA3 (Figure 2) indicates 
that the I148M substitution does not cause steatosis by simply 
increasing or decreasing the normal activity of the enzyme. Meta￾bolic studies performed in vivo and in primary cultured hepatocytes 
also support a more complex effect of the I148M substitution on 
hepatic TAG metabolism. Tracer studies provided evidence for 
increased synthesis and decreased hydrolysis of hepatic TAG in 
148M transgenic mice. Changes in the gene expression profile and 
the fatty acid composition of hepatic TAG in the PNPLA3I148M
transgenic mice were consistent with increased de novo fatty acid 
synthesis in these animals. Taken together, our data indicate that 
the increased liver fat associated with the I148M substitution is the 
cumulative result of multiple changes in hepatic TAG metabolism.
Endogenous PNPLA3 is expressed primarily in adipose tissue 
in mice (27), whereas humans express the gene at highest levels 
in the liver (28). We failed to observe any consequence of overex￾pressing wild-type or mutant human PNPLA3 in adipose tissue, 
despite high levels of transgene expression. No changes were seen 
in morphology or function of either white or brown fat, and cold 
tolerance was preserved in the A-PNPLA3WT and A-PNPLA3I148M
animals. The increased liver fat content observed in the liver-spe￾cific PNPLA3I148M transgenic mice, together with the lack of phe￾notype in A-PNPLA3I148M mice, is consistent with the notion that 
the fatty liver phenotype associated with the 148M variant is due 
to the action of the allele in the liver, rather than adipose tissue.
The finding that PNPLA3I148M causes liver fat accumulation 
when overexpressed in liver, but not in adipose tissue, is consistent

with our previous observation that adenovirus-mediated expres￾sion of the 148M allele in liver results in increased hepatic fat 
content (22). The increase in liver TAG levels in the PNPLA3I148M
transgenic mice was lower than that observed in mice infected 
with PNPLA3I148M adenovirus, where hepatic TAG levels increased 
approximately 5-fold after just 3 days (22). These data indicate that 
expression of the 148M allele results in a rapid change in hepatic 
TAG metabolism that quickly stabilizes at a new equilibrium.
Why do PNPLA3I148M transgenic mice develop steatosis on 
a chow or sucrose diet but not on a high-fat diet? Ingestion of 
sucrose stimulates de novo synthesis of fatty acids (48), whereas 
most of the hepatic fatty acids in livers of fat-fed mice are derived 
from circulating NEFAs. Perhaps PNPLA3 in hepatocytes is 
exposed preferentially to newly synthesized TAG and is shielded 
from fatty acids that enter the liver in lipoproteins or are synthe￾sized from circulating NEFAs. Alternatively, 
PNPLA3 may function specifically under 
conditions of insulin-stimulated lipid anab￾olism. The finding that PNPLA3 is virtually 
absent from livers of fasting animals and is 
strongly upregulated both transcriptionally 
(23, 27, 49, 50) and posttranslationally (28) 
by carbohydrate refeeding is consistent with 
the latter hypothesis.
It remains possible that the large increase 
in hepatic TAG levels that occurred in the fat￾fed mice (4-fold increase) obscured the differ￾ences between the lines. Arguing against this 
interpretation is the prior observation that 
hepatic TAG content was increased when the 
I148M variant was expressed at high levels in 
the ob/ob mice, in which the liver fat levels are 
appreciably higher than are those of the fat￾fed mice in this study (22).
PNPLA3 transgene expression had no 
detectable effect on 2 of the major pathways 
used by the liver to remove TAG: VLDL secre￾tion and fatty acid oxidation. TAG hydrolysis (measured as glycer￾ol release) was decreased in hepatocytes from PNPLA3I148M trans￾genic mice. This decrease in lipolysis in hepatocytes is consistent 
with the reduction in TAG hydrolysis by the purified recombinant 
148M isoform we observed previously in vitro (22). However, liver 
TAG levels are not increased in Pnpla3–/– mice, as would be expected 
if PNPLA3 was rate limiting for hepatic TAG hydrolysis (24, 25). 
Thus, the increased liver fat associated with hepatic expression of 
the 148M allele cannot be due simply to a loss of normal enzyme 
activity. The 148M allele may have an indirect effect and inhibit 
lipolysis mediated by other enzymes, such as ATGL, possibly by 
sequestering a required cofactor or by altering the composition 
of the lipid droplet.
Nor can the increased hepatic TAG associated with the variant 
allele be due to an increase in the normal enzyme activity, since we 
did not observe any increase in hepatic TAG in the mice expressing 
very high levels of the wild-type enzyme. Kumari et al. (26) reported 
that a PNPLA3-trigger factor fusion protein catalyzes the acylation 
of LPA to form PA, a key step in the glycerophosphate pathway for 
TAG biosynthesis, and that the 148M substitution increases that 
activity. This gain of function could account for the liver steatosis 
associated with the 148M allele. We have confirmed that recom￾binant PNPLA3 has LPAAT activity in vitro when expressed as a 
fusion protein with trigger factor (data not shown), though we do 
not observe an increase in LPAAT activity when the recombinant 
protein is expressed in cultured cells (23). Our data are not com￾patible with a model in which expression of the PNPLA3I148M vari￾ant causes hepatic steatosis simply by increasing hepatic LPAAT 
activity. We failed to observe a significant, reproducible increase 
in LPAAT activity in either the membranes or the lipid droplets 
isolated from the PNPLA3 transgenic mice (Figure 4E). Nor did we

observe an increase in hepatic PA formation in vivo, as determined 
by tritium incorporation from 3H-H2O (Figure 7). Although liver 
LPA levels were decreased in the transgenic mice (Figure 8A), the 
decrease was similar in PNPLA3WT transgenic and PNPLA3I148M
transgenic animals, yet the PNPLA3WT transgenic animals did not 
have increased hepatic TAG levels. Liver TAG levels in Pnpla3–/–
mice are similar to those of WT animals, despite an approximately 
50% reduction in LPAAT activity (26). Moreover, overexpression of 
wild-type PNPLA3 did not increase hepatic TAG concentrations, 
as would be expected if the enzyme promoted TAG biosynthesis 
through increased LPAAT activity.
Direct measurements of TAG biosynthesis using glycerol, ace￾tate, and oleate did not reveal differences in the rate of synthesis 
of hepatic TAG in hepatocytes from the 3 mouse lines. Previous 
studies have shown that primary hepatocytes from mice lose their 
responsiveness to insulin/SREBP-1–mediated stimulation of fatty 
acid and TAG biosynthesis within few hours of being in culture 
(Jay Horton, personal communication). Since the effect of the 
transgene is most apparent under conditions in which SREBP-1c 
is activated (high-sucrose diets), the SREBP pathway may play an 
important role in 148M-induced steatosis. Accordingly, we exam￾ined the 2 major pathways of TAG biosynthesis in intact mice 
using glycerol and tritiated water as tracers. 3H-labeled glycerol 
was incorporated into hepatic TAG at similar rates 
in all 3 lines. In contrast to these results, incorpo￾ration of tritium from 3H-H2O into TAG was sig￾nificantly increased in the PNPLA3I148M transgenic 
animals, although no differences were found in the 
incorporation of tritium into PA or DAG. A possible 
explanation for these seemingly different results is 
that the 2 tracers label different pathways. Glycerol 
is converted to glycerophosphate before it is incor￾porated into LPA, PA, DAG, and ultimately TAG 
(the glycerophosphate pathway). Tritiated water 
is incorporated into fatty acids and thus is incor￾porated into TAG via 2 pathways: the glycerophos￾phate pathway and by reesterification of monoglyc￾erides with acyl-CoAs (the monoglyceride pathway). 
The increased incorporation of 3H-H2O, but not 
glycerol, into hepatic TAG in the PNPLA3I148M
transgenic mice may reflect increased biosynthesis 
of hepatic TAG via the monoglyceride pathway. The 
finding that MGAT1 mRNA levels were increased in 
the PNPLA3I148M transgenic mice is consistent with 
this possibility. Humans with NAFLD have recently 
been reported to have increased hepatic MGAT activity (51)
Levels of mRNA encoding the lipid droplet–associated pro￾tein CIDEC, which were increased in the livers of PNPLA3I148M
transgenic mice, are also upregulated in other mouse models of 
fatty liver disease (52, 53). Expression CIDEC is associated with 
an increase in the size of cytosolic lipid droplets in various cell 
types (53). Whether the increased expression of CIDEC contrib￾utes to the increased lipid droplet size in this animal model will 
require additional studies.
Purified recombinant PNPLA3 has been found to have 5 enzy￾matic activities: TAG, DAG, and MAG hydrolysis (22, 23, 29) as well 
as acyl-CoA thioesterase (23) and LPAAT activity (26). These differ￾ent activities are not equally affected by the I148M substitution. In 
in vitro assays, the I148M substitution results in a substantial loss 
of TAG, MAG, and DAG hydrolytic activity (23); a modest reduc￾tion in acyl-CoA thioesterase activity (23); and an increase in LPAAT 
activity (26). Considered in isolation, none of these activities alone 
can explain all of the changes in TAG metabolism observed in the 
PNPLA3I148M transgenic mice. Therefore, some of the metabolic 
changes observed in these animals are likely to be secondary rather 
than direct consequences of altered PNPLA3 activity.
The spectrum of TAG–fatty acids in the livers of both transgenic 
lines of mice provides further evidence that PNPLA3 expression

affects hepatic TAG composition as well as quantity. The TAG–
fatty acid profiles of the PNPLA3I148M transgenic mice (and to a 
lesser extent the PNPLA3WT transgenic mice) differ significantly 
from those of wild-type mice and are qualitatively similar to those 
observed when SREBP-1c is overexpressed in liver (54). The hepatic 
TAG–fatty acid profile of the PNPLA3I148M transgenic mice is there￾fore consistent with the increased fatty acid synthesis we observed 
in these animals (Figure 7). The proportion of long-chain polyun￾saturated fatty acids in hepatic TAG was significantly reduced in 
the transgenic mice (Figure 8B), suggesting that PNPLA3 may play 
a role in remodeling TAG during the postprandial period. Since 
long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids are powerful inhibitors of 
SREBP-1c (55), expression of the mutant PNPLA3 transgene may 
lead to increased SREBP-1c activity by lowering polyunsaturated 
fatty acid levels. The finding that multiple mRNAs of SREBP-1c 
target genes are increased in the livers of PNPLA3I148M transgenic 
mice is consistent with this notion.
Simple hepatic steatosis appears to be benign, but a subset of 
individuals with steatosis develop an inflammatory condition (ste￾atohepatitis) that can progress to cirrhosis (2, 4, 47). The reason 
why some individuals are more susceptible to the adverse sequelae 
of increased hepatic TAG levels is not known. The PNPLA3I148M
variant has been shown to increase the risk of progressive liver 
disease, including steatohepatitis and cirrhosis (11). Whether 
the increased risk of progressive liver disease conferred by the 
PNPLA3I148M variant results directly from the action of the mutant 
protein, or is a consequence of the increased risk of steatosis con￾ferred by the allele, is not known. Studies in the PNPLA3I148M
transgenic mice may help to address this question and potentially 
elucidate the factors that mediate the transition from benign ste￾atosis to clinically significant liver disease.
A potential limitation of this model is that the transgene is 
human and is expressed at higher levels than the endogenous 
mouse protein. The human and mouse PNPLA3 proteins share 
75% sequence identity within the patatin domain but are less 
similar in the C-terminal half of the proteins. Despite these differ￾ences, the wild-type and mutant human proteins appear to traffic 
normally to the lipid droplet when expressed in the mouse liver 
(Supplemental Figure 1). We are in the process of developing mice 
in which the I148M variant has been knocked into the endogenous 
gene. It remains possible that the fatty liver phenotype requires 
higher level expression or sequences specific to the human protein.
The relationship between the I148M polymorphism in PNPLA3
and NAFLD is one of several hundred genetic associations 
revealed by genome-wide association studies. Whereas these asso￾ciations can identify genes that contribute to disease processes, in 
almost all cases the phenotypic effect attributable to the variation 
is small and the mechanistic basis of the association remains to 
be defined. The modest phenotypic effects of common sequence 
variations indicate either that the variation has limited impact on 
gene function or that the gene is not a major determinant of the 
phenotype. The finding that neither genetic ablation nor chronic, 
high level expression of wild-type PNPLA3 affects liver fat content 
in mice suggests that variation in the normal activity of PNPLA3 
is not a major determinant of liver fat content and that the asso￾ciation with fatty liver disease is peculiar to 148M allele. The 
development of an animal model that recapitulates the metabolic 
phenotype associated with the allele in humans provides a new 
in vivo system in which to elucidate the mechanistic relationship 
between this variant and NAFLD.
Methods
Animals. The human PNPLA3 cDNA was cloned into the MluI sites of 
pLiv-11, an expression vector containing a constitutive human apoE gene 
promoter with a hepatic enhancer (a gift from John Taylor, Gladstone 
Institute, UCSF, San Francisco, California, USA) (30, 56). After verifying 
the sequence of the transgene, an 11-kb SalI-SpeI fragment containing the 
promoter elements and the cDNA was isolated and injected into fertilized 
eggs of C57BL/6J mice to generate transgenic mice as previously described 
(44). Founder mice were identified by genomic blotting using DNA isolat￾ed from their tails (DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit, Qiagen). Eleven founders 
for PNPLA3WT transgenic mice and eleven for the PNPLA3I148M transgenic 
mice were bred to C57BL/6J mice. Mice with the transgene were identified 
using PCR (primers, 5′-GAGCAAGAATTTGCAACTTGCTACCCATTAG-3′
and 5′-ATGGAGAGGAGGGGGCTGAGAATTGTGTGG-3′) to amplify a 
681-bp fragment from human PNPLA3 and 5′-ATGTATGACCCAGAGC￾GC CG-3′ plus 5′-GGACAAACCTTCTGCGGCTC-3′ to amplified a 510-bp 
fragment from mouse Pnpla3.
Transgenic mice expressing PNPLA3 predominantly in adipose tissue 
were developed using an expression construct with an aP2 promoter (31). 
The human PNPLA3 cDNAs (both wild-type and I148M) were cloned 
into the SmaI sites of pBluescript II SK(+), which contains the 5.4-kb 
promoter/enhancer of the mouse Ap2 gene (57). A 7-kb ClaI-NotI frag￾ment containing the aP2 promoter upstream of PNPLA3 was purified and 
injected into fertilized eggs to generate transgenic mice (22). Six found￾ers for A-PNPLA3WT and 4 founders for A-PNPLA3I148M mice were iden￾tified by genomic blotting and crossed with C57BL/6J mice. Transgenic 
offspring were identified using PCR and oppositely oriented primers 
(5′-GCTGGGAGAGATATGCCTTCGAGG-3′ and 5′-GCTGGTGGG￾CACTGGAGTGGCAAC-3′) that amplify a 813-bp fragment from the 
transgene and primers (5′-ATGTATGACCCAGAGCGCCG-3′ and 
5′-GGACAAACCTTCTGCGGCTC-3′) that amplify a 510-bp fragment 
from mouse Pnpla3. Mice with the highest level transgenic expression were 
bred to C57BL/6J for the experiments described in this article.
Lines were established from 3 founder mice for both the L-PNPLA3WT
and L-PNPLA3I148M transgenes. Two lines of the A-PNPLA3WT and 3 lines 
of A-PNPLA3I148M were also established.
All mice were maintained on a 12-hour-light/12-hour-dark cycle and fed 
the Teklad Mouse/Rat Diet 7001 (Harlan Teklad) ad libitum. The mice 
used in the experiments were offspring of heterozygous X wild-type mat￾ings, and nontransgenic littermates were used as controls.
For the dietary challenge studies, mice were fed a high-fat diet (D12451; 
45% kcal from lard, Research Diets) or a high-sucrose diet (no. 901683; 
MP Biomedicals). Total body fat and lean body mass were determined by 
nuclear magnetic resonance using the Minispec analyzer (Bruker).
Liver and plasma chemistries. Lipids were extracted from livers (100–200 
mg) using the method of Folch and Lees (58). The levels of TAG, choles￾terol, cholesteryl ester, free cholesterol, and phosphatidylcholine were mea￾sured using enzymatic assays (Infinity, Thermo Electron Corp., and Wako 
Inc.) and normalized to sample weight. Serum levels of ALT, AST, TAG, 
cholesterol, and glucose were measured using the Vitros 250 system (GMI 
Inc.). Enzymatic assay kits were used to determine serum levels of NEFA 
(Wako Inc.) and ketone bodies (Pointe Scientific Inc.). Serum levels of insu￾lin were measured using an ELISA assay (Crystal Chem Inc.).
Glucose and insulin tolerance testing. Ten-week-old chow-fed mice were fasted 
for 16 hours prior to intraperitoneal injection of glucose (1.5 g/kg). Plasma 
levels of glucose were monitored at the indicated times (see Supplemental 
Figure 2). Insulin tolerance was assessed in mice that were fasted for 4 hours. 
Human insulin (0.75 unit/kg, Eli Lilly) was injected into the peritoneal 
fluid, and plasma levels of glucose were measured (Contour, Bayer) prior to 
the injection and at the indicated time points, as previously described (59).

ously (65). Briefly, after a 4-hour incubation, cells were equilibrated with 
buffer (111 mM NaCl, 4.7 mM KCl, 2 mM MgSO4, 1.2 mM Na2HP04, 
2.5 mM glucose, 0.5 mM carnitine) and incubated at 37°C for 60 minutes 
prior to addition of palmitate-BSA (200 μm) and etomoxir (300 μm).
RNA expression. Total RNA was isolated from tissues of 4 mice from each 
group using RNA STAT-60 (Tel-Test Inc.), and Real-Time PCR measurements 
were performed as previously described (66). Expression levels of PNPLA3WT
and PNPLA3I148M hepatic mRNA were measured using oppositely oriented 
primers (5′-TGCAACTTGCTACCCATTAGGA-3′ and 5′-TCGCAATGGCA￾GATTCCA-3′). Mouse 36B4 mRNA was used as an internal control.
Tissue fractionation and immunoblotting. Lipid droplets were isolated from 
the livers of wild-type mice and PNPLA3WT and PNPLA3I148M transgenic 
mice and from the BAT and WAT of wild-type mice and A-PNPLA3WT and 
A-PNPLA3I148M mice as described previously (22). Liver, BAT, and WAT tis￾sues (0.2 g) were homogenized in 2 ml of buffer C (20 mM Tris HCl, pH 
7.4, 1 mM EDTA) using a Polytron homogenizer and then passed through 
a 21-gauge needle 25 times. Homogenates were centrifuged (1,000 g) for 
10 minutes at 4°C and the post-nuclear supernatant (PNS) was adjusted 
to 20% (w/v) sucrose in buffer C plus 60% sucrose. The PNS was placed at 
the bottom of a 11.5 ml ultracentrifuge tube (Sorvall) and overlaid with 
buffer C plus 5% sucrose (5 ml), followed by buffer C alone. The tube was 
clamped and centrifuged at 28,000 g (T-875, Thermo Scientific) for 30 min￾utes at 4°C. After centrifugation, lipids were isolated, combined with 20 
volumes of precooled acetone and stored overnight at –20°C. The precipi￾tated proteins were pelleted by centrifugation at 4,300 g for 1 hour at 4°C 
and then resuspended in buffer C plus 1% SDS. A total of 1% of the lipid 
droplet protein was size-fractionated on an 8% SDS-PAGE gel, transferred 
to a nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences), and then subjected 
to immunoblot analysis using a rabbit anti-human PNPLA3 polyclonal 
antibody directed against the last 20 amino acids of human PNPLA3 
(1:1,000 dilution) (22) and a polyclonal antibody to PLIN2 (1:1,000 dilu￾tion) (Fitzgerald Industries International). Proteins were visualized using 
Super-Signal ECL (Pierce Biotechnology).
To measure levels of Akt and phosphorylated Akt, frozen liver was 
homogenized in modified RIPA buffer (20 mM TrisCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM 
NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1% NP40, 1 mM sodium 
orthovanadate, 1 mM PMSF, and 0.1% SDS) with complete protease inhib￾itors (Roche Diagnostics). A total of 40 μg liver lysate was subjected to 
immunoblotting as described above using anti-Akt and anti–phospho-Akt 
(Ser473) mAbs (Cell Signaling).
Core body temperature. Core body temperature was measured as previously 
described (67). Briefly, mice were fasted for 12 hours and then placed in a 
cold room (4°C) for 3 hours. Core body temperature was measured using 
a rectal digital thermometer (Physitemp Instruments Inc.) at the indicated 
time points (see Supplemental Figure 3).
LPAAT activity of membrane and lipid droplet fractions of mouse liver. Livers 
were isolated from anesthetized mice and homogenized in 5 ml prechilled 
lysis buffer (50 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 0.25 M sucrose, 1 mM 
DTT, 1 mM EDTA, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml antipain, and 1 μg/ml 
pepstatin). Homogenates were centrifuged for 15 minutes at 9,500 g at 
4°C. Supernatants were transferred to ultracentrifuge tubes (14 ml) and 
overlaid with buffer B containing 50 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, 
100 mM KCl, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml antipain, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin. 
After centrifugation at 100,000 g for 2 hours at 4°C (TH641, Sorvall), lipids 
were collected and washed with buffer B 3 times. Membranes were washed 
3 times with buffer B. To assay LPAAT activity in lipid droplets, 2 μg pro￾tein was added to 200 μl of a solution containing 50 mM TrisCl, pH 7.4, 
200 μM LPA, and 5.5 μM 14C oleoyl-CoA. To assay enzyme activity in the 
membrane fraction, additional cold 50 μM oleoyl-CoA was added to the 
reaction mix. After 10 minutes at 37°C, reactions were transferred to an 
Tissue morphology. Liver and adipose tissue were collected from isoflu￾rane-anesthetized mice and fixed in 10% formalin for 48 hours and then 
embedded in paraffin, sectioned, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. 
For Oil Red O staining, the liver was fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 
48 hours and equilibrated in 10% sucrose for 12 hours and then in 18% 
sucrose for 12 hours at 4°C, prior to cryosectioning by Molecular Pathol￾ogy Core facility of University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center.
Quantifying the numbers and sizes of lipid droplets. The ImageJ program (NIH) 
was used to determine the numbers and sizes of lipid droplets in images 
of Oil Red O–stained sections from the livers of transgenic animals (60). 
The program classifies the different colors in the images into RGB channel 
components and calculates the area and pixel value statistics of the image 
according to user-defined criteria. Oil Red O–stained structures were 
analyzed in the green channel using the image particle analysis macro as 
described previously (61).
In vivo lipid metabolism. Incorporation of 3H-glycerol into TAG was mea￾sured in 4 chow-fed male mice of each genotype. Mice were injected with 
3H-glycerol (1.6 nmol, 133 × 106 dpm/nmol) and killed 30 minutes later. 
The livers were collected and processed as previously described (35). Incor￾poration of 3H-H2O into fatty acids, PA, DAG, and TAG was performed 
in 2 experiments that included 10 male mice (aged 10–12 weeks). Mice 
were maintained on a high-sucrose diet for 1 week and then fasted for 
1 hour. Mice were then injected with 3H-H2O (50 mCi in 250 μl 0.9% NaCl) 
as described previously (35, 44).
To measure VLDL secretion, 5 male mice (aged 10–12 weeks) of each gen￾otype were fasted for 6 hours at the beginning of the light cycle, anesthe￾tized with sodium pentobarbital (80 mg/kg), and then given a bolus of Tri￾ton WR-1339 (Tyloxapol; Sigma-Aldrich) (500 mg/kg) via the tail vein (62). 
Blood was collected from the retro-orbital plexus in EDTA-coated tubes 
(Microvette 500 KE, Sartedt) at the indicated time points (see Figure 5) 
and assayed for plasma levels of TAG.
Lipid metabolism in mouse primary hepatocytes. Primary hepatocytes were 
isolated from the livers of nonfasted wild-type mice and PNPLA3WT and 
PNPLA3I148M transgenic mice and grown in culture as described previously 
(63). After 2 hours in culture, cells were washed with PBS. DMEM containing 
5% (v/v) delipidated FCS, 14C-glycerol (1 μCi/ml) (American Radiolabeled 
Chemicals Inc.), 1.5 mM glycerol, 0.6 mM oleic acid, penicillin (100 unit/
ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) was added to the cells. Cells were grown 
at 37°C in 5% CO2 for the indicated times (see Figure 4). Alternatively, pri￾mary hepatocytes were incubated with 14C-acetate (1 μCi/ml) (Perkin Elmer) 
and 1.0 mM acetate or with 14C-oleic acid (1 μCi/ml), 1.5 mM glycerol, and 
0.6 mM oleic acid for the indicated times and then washed 3 times with PBS. 
Lipids were extracted twice with 1 ml isopropanol/hexane (2:3) for 30 min￾utes at room temperature and then dried under nitrogen stream (64). Lipids 
were separated by TLC using hexane/diethyl ether/acetic acid (80:20:1) and 
visualized with iodine vapor. TAG was scraped from the plate, and the radio￾activity was counted using a scintillation counter (Beckman Inc.). Proteins 
were extracted from delipidated cells by incubating in 1 N NaOH.
To measure TAG hydrolysis, primary hepatocytes were incubated with 
14C-glycerol (1 μCi/ml) for 4 hours and then washed twice with ice-cold 
PBS. Triacsin C (5 μM) in DMEM containing 5% (v/v) delipidated FCS plus 
penicillin (100 units/ml) and streptomycin (100 ug/ml) was added to the 
cells. Cells were maintained at 37°C in 5% CO2 for the indicated time (see 
Figure 5), and then medium was collected and extracted with 4 ml Folch 
solution. The aqueous phase was transferred to a scintillation vial, and the 
radioactivity was quantified.
To measure fatty acid oxidation, primary hepatocytes were seeded at 
2 × 104 cells per well on XF-24 cell culture plates (Seahorse Bioscience) 
coated with rat tail collagen gel in medium containing DMEM with 5% 
FCS. Cellular oxygen consumption rate was measured as described previ-

Symmetry 300Å C4 (2.1 × 100 mm) column with a particle size of 1.7 μm 
(Waters Corp) that was maintained at 90°C. External calibration curves 
were constructed using standards ranging from 0.001 to 2 μg/ml (Avanti 
Polar Lipids Inc.) to measure the following species of LPA (16:0, 16:1, 18:0, 
18:1, 18:2, 20:4, 22:6) and PA (16:0/18:1, 16:0/18:2, 16:0/20:4, 18:0/20:4). 
Flow rate was set at 0.3 ml/min. A gradient started at 90% mobile phase A 
(H2O plus 0.2% DMIPA) and 10% mobile phase B (isopropanol plus metha￾nol [90/10, v/v] with 0.2 % DMIPA) was ramped to 77% mobile phase A over 
4 minutes and then reduced progressively to 30% over 10 minutes and was 
at 1% within 11.5 minutes. The gradient was held for 1 minute at 1% mobile 
phase A and then equilibrated to the starting conditions for 3 minutes. The 
MS was operated in negative ion ionization mode at 20,000 full-width half￾mass resolution (FWHM), and acquisition ranged from 100 to 1,000 m/z.
Neutral lipids were extracted from liver tissue (50 mg) after adding 20 μl 
of an internal standard solution containing 2 μg/ml TAG 51:0 (Avanti Polar 
Lipids Inc.). Dichloromethane/methanol (2:1) (1 ml) was added, and the 
samples were homogenized (42,500 g, twice for 30 seconds, with a 15-sec￾ond pause) (69). Water (200 μl) was added, and the sample was vortexed for 
30 seconds before the homogenate was centrifuged at 42,500 g at 5°C for 10 
minutes. A total of 10 μl of the lower layer (organic phase) was transferred 
to an LC vial and diluted in 490 μl of injection solvent (65% acetonitrile, 30% 
isopropanol, 5% water) and analyzed by LC/MS exactly as described previ￾ously (71). Data was normalized for liver weights. Since the measurement of 
DAGs was used in an untargeted profile mode and standards were not avail￾able, the data are reported as AUC. The internal standard was used to cal￾culate a response ratio (analyte/internal standard) and the data were scaled 
using Pareto scaling, which uses the square root of SD as the scaling factor.
Statistics. All data are presented as mean ± SEM. Differences among 
group means were assessed by a 2-tailed, nonpaired Student’s t test using 
the Graphpad Prism statistical software (Graphpad Software Inc.). Results 
were considered statistically significant at P < 0.05.
Study approval. All animal experiments were performed with the approval 
of the Institutional Animal Care and Research Advisory Committee at Uni￾versity of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas.

ice bath. A total of 1.2 ml of Folch solution was added prior to addition of 
2% phosphoric acid (200 μl) to induce phase isolation. The bottom phase 
was recovered and dried under N2. The dried lipids were reconstituted in 
80 μl chloroform and spotted onto TLC plates. The major classes of lip￾ids were resolved using chloroform/methanol/acetone/acetic acid/water 
(50:10:20:12:5) as the mobile phase. TLC plates were subjected to phospho￾rimaging analysis, and bands corresponding to PA were scraped, and the 
radioactivity was quantified by scintillation counting.
Measurements of selected hepatic lipids in the mice. Lipids were extracted from 
livers (100–200 mg) and separated into cholesteryl esters, TAGs, and phos￾pholipids using TLC as previously described (68). Fatty acids from the 
TAG fraction were methyl esterified and separated by gas-LC (GLC) using 
a Hewlett Packard 6890 Series GC system. The identity of the fatty acid 
methyl esters was determined by comparing the retention times with fatty 
acid standards (GLC-744, NU-Chek Prep). The percentage of each fatty 
acid was calculated in the TAG fraction. Pentadecanoic acid (C15:0) was 
added as an internal standard. The fatty acid concentration in TAG was 
calculated based on the area of C15:0 peak.
Phospholipids. Lipid analysis was performed as described in detail else￾where (45, 46). Briefly, glycerophospholipids from liver tissue were 
extracted using a modified Bligh and Dyer procedure (69). Frozen mouse 
liver (~10 mg) was homogenized in 800 μl of ice-cold 0.1 N HCl/CH3OH 
(1:1) using a tight-fit glass homogenizer (Kimble/Kontes Glass Co.) for 
about 1 minute on ice. The suspension was then transferred to cold 1.5 
ml Eppendorf tubes and vortexed with 400 μl of cold CHCl3 for 1 minute. 
The extraction proceeded with centrifugation (5 minutes, 4°C, 18,000 g) 
to separate the 2 phases. The lower organic layer was collected and sol￾vent evaporated. The resulting lipid film was dissolved in 100 μl of mobile 
phase A [isopropanol/hexane/100 mM NH4COOH (aq) (58:40:2)]. Quan￾tification of glycerophospholipids was achieved by the use of an LC/MS 
technique, employing synthetic odd-carbon diacyl and lysophospholipid 
standards. Typically, 200 ng of each odd-carbon standard was added per 10 
to 20 mg tissue. Glycerophospholipids were analyzed on an Applied Biosys￾tems/MDS SCIEX 4000 Q TRAP hybrid triple quadrupole/linear ion trap 
mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems) and a Shimadzu high-pressure 
LC system with a Phenomenex Luna Silica column (2 × 250 mm, 5-μm 
particle size) using a gradient elution as previously described (39, 40). The 
identification of the individual species, achieved by LC/MS/MS, was based 
on their chromatographic and mass spectral characteristics. This analysis 
allows identification of the 2 fatty acid moieties but does not differentiate 
relative position on the glycerol backbone (sn-1 versus sn-2).
LPA, PA, and DAG analysis by high-resolution LC/MS. To measure hepatic 
levels of LPA and PA in the transgenic mice, 400 μl PBS was added to 50 
mg liver tissue, and the mixture was spiked with 5 μg/ml LPA 17:0 (Avanti 
Polar Lipids Inc.). Samples were homogenized using a Precellys 24 homog￾enizer (Bertin Technologies) (5,500 rpm, twice for 30 seconds, with a 
15-second pause). Citrate buffer (400 μl, pH 4.0) was added to the sample, 
and the mixture was centrifuged (42,500 g, 10 minutes) at 5°C. Lipids were 
extracted using acidic butanol (1 ml) followed by saturated butanol (0.5 
ml) as described previously (70). The extracted fractions were combined 
and evaporated under N2 at room temperature, and the dried extract was 
reconstituted in 50% water, 50% methanol, 0.1% dimethylisopropylamine 
(DMIPA), and 5% acetic acid (100 μl). A total of 20 μl of the extract was 
injected into a LC (UPLC, Waters Corp) coupled to a MS QTOF (Synapt 
G2 HDMS, Waters Corp). Separation was performed using an Acquity
