Abstract
Introduction: Malnutrition is a frequent problem associated with detrimental clinical outcomes in critically ill
patients. To avoid malnutrition, most studies focus on the prevention of inadequate nutrition delivery, whereas
little attention is paid to the potential role of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI). In this trial, we aim to evaluate
the prevalence of EPI and identify its potential risk factors in critically ill adult patients without preexisting
pancreatic diseases.
Methods: In this prospective cross-sectional study, we recruited 563 adult patients with critical illnesses. All details
of the patients were documented, stool samples were collected three to five days following the initiation of
enteral nutrition, and faecal elastase 1 (FE-1) concentrations were assayed using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay kit. Blood samples were also taken to determine serum amylase and lipase activity.
Results: The percentages of recruited patients with EPI (FE-1 concentration <200 μg/g) and severe EPI (FE-1
concentration <100 μg/g) were 52.2% and 18.3%, respectively. The incidences of steatorrhea were significantly
different (P < 0.05) among the patients without EPI, with moderate EPI (FE-1 concentration = 100 to 200 μg/g) and
severe EPI (FE-1 concentration < 100 μg/g). Both multivariate logistic regression analysis and z-tests indicated that
the occurrence of EPI was closely associated with shock, sepsis, diabetes, cardiac arrest, hyperlactacidemia, invasive
mechanical ventilation and haemodialysis.
Conclusions: More than 50% of critically ill adult patients without primary pancreatic diseases had EPI, and nearly
one-fifth of them had severe EPI. The risk factors for EPI included shock, sepsis, diabetes, cardiac arrest,
hyperlactacidemia, invasive mechanical ventilation and haemodialysis.

Introduction
It is well-known that malnutrition, a common problem in
patients admitted to ICU, has a negative impact on clinical
outcomes, such as higher risk of infection and multiple
organ dysfunction, prolonged mechanical ventilation and
hospital stay, and increased morbidity and mortality [1,2].
Moreover, it has been proposed that the incidence of mal￾nutrition will be more frequent in coming decades because
of the increasing number of ICU patients who are older
and/or obese and have chronic diseases, which inevitably
aggravate stress-related catabolism and negative energy
balance [1]. To prevent the occurrence of malnutrition,
the vast majority of current studies focus on strategies to
improve the efficacy of nutritional support [2,3], as insuffi￾cient nutritional delivery has been considered to be a
crucial determinant of malnutrition in critically ill patients
[4-6].
Malnutrition is also a major consequence and clinical
manifestation of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI),
because pancreatic enzymes are essential for the digestion
of macronutrients and inadequate release of pancreatic
enzymes leads to maldigestion and malabsorption of fat,
as well as, to a lesser extent, proteins and carbohydrates
[78]. More importantly, pancreatic damage is frequently

observed in critically ill patients without primary pancrea￾tic diseases, although the majority of these diseases do not
develop into pancreatitis. For example, Manjuck et al. [9]
reported that the incidences of hyperamylasemia and
hyperlipasemia in interdisciplinary ICU patients without
prior pancreatic diseases were 32.7% and 40.4%, respec￾tively. Denz et al. [10] found that morphological altera￾tions of the pancreas were detected by computed
tomography in 35% of ICU patients without preexisting
pancreatic diseases and that elevated serum lipase activity
was present in 78.8% of critically ill patients. Tribl et al.
[11] discovered that exocrine pancreatic dysfunction
occurred in ICU patients in the absence of significant pan￾creatic enzyme elevation or histological evidence of pan￾creatic damage, suggesting that a broad spectrum of
pancreatic damage may be present in critically ill patients.
Based on the high incidence of pancreatic damage in ICU
patients, it is reasonable to speculate that EPI might be
another critical contributor to malnutrition in addition to
inadequate intake of nutrition in critically ill patients.
Unfortunately, little is known about the prevalence of
EPI and its determinants in critically ill patients as well
as about the underlying association between malnutri￾tion and EPI. Therefore, we performed the present
study to screen for EPI and try to identify the potential
risk factors for EPI in critically ill adult patients without
primary pancreatic diseases who were receiving early
enteral nutrition (EN).
Materials and methods
Study population
From December 2011 to November 2012, 1,679 critically
ill patients were admitted to the emergency ICU and the
general ICU at Shanghai Tenth People’s Hospital, Tongji
University, and both ICUs were within a fully enclosed
medical and surgical mixed setup. The patients who
required early EN and were expected to stay in the ICU
for at least three days were considered for enrolment into
this study. Exclusion criteria were age under 18 years,
pregnancy or breastfeeding, and any patients with comor￾bid preexisting EPI due to pancreatitis, cystic fibrosis,
celiac disease, Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, pancreatic and
ampullary tumours, or gastrointestinal and pancreatic
surgical resections [7,8]. Patients were also excluded if
they were prescribed drugs (including somatostatin,
aprotinin, valproate and carbamazepine) that may affect
the secretion of pancreatic enzymes or if they were
accompanied by EN intolerance for three consecutive
days, which was defined as the disruption of EN feeding
plan due to any of the following reasons: prefeeding gas￾tric residual volume more than 500 ml, aspiration, diar￾rhoea, severe abdominal distention or gastrointestinal
bleeding. A total of 563 patients were finally recruited
into this prospective cross-sectional study, and informed
consent documents were signed by immediate family
members of these patients. The study protocol was per￾formed in accordance with the institutional guidelines for
the conduct of research on human beings and approved
by the Human Ethics Committee of Shanghai Tenth
People’s Hospital.
Study design
Once the enrolled patients were admitted to the ICU,
either a nasogastric tube or a nasojejunal tube (Nutricia
Pharmaceutical Co, Shanghai, China) was inserted, guided
by an electronic gastroscope according to the expected
feeding time, and the position of the feeding tube was con￾firmed by plain abdominal radiographs. EN was initiated at
a rate of 25 ml/h within 24 hours of admission, and the
infusion rate was increased steadily until the prescribed
nutritional requirements were achieved within three days.
Tube feeding may be temporarily discontinued because of
intolerance of EN but resumed at a lower infusion rate
four to six hours later. The formula of the EN diet was an
isotonic EN suspension with dietary fibre (Jevity; Abbott,
Hoofddorp, the Netherlands) which contained 20 g of pro￾tein, 17 g of fat, 70 g of carbohydrates and 525 calories of
energy per 500 ml. Daily nutritional requirements were
calculated by a dietitian and mainly based on the patient’s
body mass index (BMI). To achieve quality bowel move￾ments, the bowel motion and sounds of all recruited
patients were assessed and documented daily, and lactu￾lose (15 ml; Abbott, Shanghai, China) and rhubarb soda
(three tablets; Shanghai Traditional Chinese Pharmaceuti￾cal, Shanghai, China) were routinely given three times per
day. If no bowel movement occurred on the second day of
admission, an itopride hydrochloride tablet (50 mg;
Abbott, Tokyo, Japan) was initiated orally three times per
day and glycerine enema (110 ml; Shanghai Huangpu
Pharmaceutical, Shanghai, China) was used rectally
as required. If a patient had no bowel motion within
48 hours after admission, an abdominal X-ray was done to
exclude ileus and paraffin oil or vegetable oil (40 ml) was
applied orally two times per day. Once diarrhoea was pre￾sent, these bowel protocols were terminated until bowel
movements were absent again.
During the study, the details of each patient at admis￾sion, such as age, sex, BMI, diagnosis and Acute Physiol￾ogy and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II)
score, were collected. The incidences of steatorrhea
(loose, frothy, foul-smelling and buoyant stools) and diar￾rhoea (more than three loose bowel movements per day)
following the initiation of EN were also documented.
Clinical characteristics that may cause exocrine pancrea￾tic damage, including shock (systolic blood pressure
<90 mmHg), tissue hypoxia (serum lactate >2 mmol/L),
respiratory failure (partial pressure of oxygen in arterial
blood <60 mmHg), anaemia (haemoglobin <80 g/L),

obesity (BMI >30 kg/m2
), hyperbilirubinemia (total biliru￾bin >17.5 μmol/L), hypertriglyceridemia (> 1.7 mmol/L),
diabetes (fasting blood glucose ≥7 mmol/L), sepsis (sys￾temic inflammatory response syndrome plus documented
infection), brain injury (due to severe trauma, acute stroke
or neurosurgery), cardiac arrest, invasive mechanical venti￾lation and continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT)
were recorded prospectively. Stool samples were collected
three to five days after the onset of EN and frozen at -20°C
until analysis, and arterial blood samples were also taken
at the time to determine serum amylase and lipase levels.
Biochemical measurements
The enzymatic activities of serum amylase and lipase
were measured using a biochemistry analyser (VITROS
350; Ortho Clinical Diagnostics, Melbourne, Australia)
at our clinical laboratory centre. Measurements were
repeated using duplicated blood samples, and the nor￾mal reference values of serum amylase and lipase were
less than 190 U/L and 220 U/L, respectively.
Faecal elastase 1 (FE-1) concentrations in the stool spe￾cimens were determined by using an enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay kit (ScheBo BioTech AG, Giessen,
Germany) as described elsewhere [12]. Briefly, two
monoclonal antibodies against different specific epitopes
of human pancreatic elastase 1 were applied, and the
antigen-antibody complex was revealed by the addition
of peroxidase-streptavidin, which was able to bind the
biotin-conjugated second monoclonal antibody. The con￾centrations of oxidized peroxidase substrate were assayed
by using a microplate reader (Infinite 200 PRO; Tecan,
Männedorf, Switzerland) at 405 nm with 492 nm as the
reference wavelength. Duplicate assays were carried out,
and FE-1 concentrations were calculated from the stan￾dard curve. The results were expressed as micrograms of
FE-1 per gram of stool. Typically, the normal level of
FE-1 concentration is no less than 200 μg/g, with a
value less than 100 μg/g indicating severe EPI and a value
between 100 μg/g and 200 μg/g classified as moderate
EPI [13,14].
Statistical analysis
All data were analysed using SigmaStat 3.5 software
(Systat Software Inc, San Jose, CA, USA), and P < 0.05
was considered statistically significant. Quantitative vari￾ables were expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD),
and differences between groups were assessed by one￾way analysis of variance followed by a Tukey test when
appropriate. Categorical variables were presented as pro￾portions, and the comparison between groups was evalu￾ated by z-test. The odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence
intervals (CIs) were estimated by multivariate logistic
regression analysis, in which the dependent variable was
EPI (FE-1 <200 μg/g), and the independent covariables
included shock, anaemia, sepsis, diabetes, obesity, cardiac
arrest, respiratory failure, hyperbilirubinemia, brain
injury, hyperlactacidemia, hypertriglyceridemia, invasive
mechanical ventilation and CRRT.
Results
Of 1,679 critically ill adult patients assessed for eligibil￾ity, 811 patients were considered for recruitment into
the present study. Seventy-four patients were excluded
because they did not meet the inclusion criteria, and
another fifty-seven patients were excluded because they
refused to participate (Figure 1). Among the 680
patients enrolled into this study, 69, 27 and 21 patients
were excluded because of EN intolerance, the applica￾tion of pancreatic secretion-suppressing drugs and fail￾ure to collect stool specimens within three to five days
following early EN, respectively (Figure 1). Thus, data
collection and analysis were performed in a total of 563
patients.
Among the recruited ICU patients (N = 563) without
EPI, with moderate EPI or with severe EPI, there were
no statistical differences in age, gender, BMI and
APACHE II score, but the incidences of steatorrhea and
diarrhoea and the levels of serum amylase and lipase
were significantly higher in the patients with severe EPI
than in those without EPI (Table 1). Moreover, the inci￾dence of steatorrhea in the patients with severe EPI was
also higher than that in those with moderate EPI.
The prevalence of hyperamylasemia (>190 U/L), hyperli￾pasemia (>220 U/L), EPI (FE-1 concentration <200 μg/g)
and severe EPI (FE-1 concentration <100 μg/g) in the
enrolled ICU patients is illustrated in Figure 2. Among
these data, the highest was EPI (52.2%), followed by hyper￾lipasemia (34.9%), hyperamylasemia (30.2%) and severe
EPI (18.3%).
In the patients with EPI, the percentages of patients with
shock, sepsis, diabetes, cardiac arrest, hyperlactacidemia,
invasive mechanical ventilation or CRRT were significantly
higher than in those without EPI (Table 2). Furthermore,
multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that the
occurrence of EPI was directly associated with shock, sep￾sis, diabetes, cardiac arrest, hyperlactacidemia, invasive
mechanical ventilation and CRRT (Table 3).
Discussion
As measured by FE-1 concentration, EPI occurred in
52.2% of critically ill adult patients without preexisting
pancreatic diseases, and nearly one-fifth of them could
be diagnosed as having severe EPI. To the best of our
knowledge, this trial is the first large-scale investigation
to evaluate the prevalence of EPI and severe EPI in a
population with critical illness. The results also demon￾strated that the occurrence of EPI was closely correlated
to clinical characteristics such as shock, sepsis, diabetes,

cardiac arrest, hyperlactacidemia, invasive mechanical
ventilation and CRRT.
In this study, FE-1 concentration was selected to assess
the occurrence and extent of EPI, because FE-1 determi￾nation with a cutoff less than 200 μg/g has been shown
to have high sensitivity and specificity for the detection
of moderate to severe EPI in comparison with the “gold
standard” for the evaluation of exocrine pancreatic secre￾tion, the secretin-caerulein test [15,16]. Moreover, faecal
concentration of elastase 1 was reported to be signifi￾cantly correlated with the amount of this enzyme
secreted by the exocrine pancreas [15,17], and only one,
single, small stool collected at random is sufficient to
evaluate exocrine pancreatic status by FE-1 assay [18].
Besides, the variation of FE-1 concentration in stool
samples is very limited because of the application of
human-specific monoclonal antibodies against pancreatic
elastase 1 and FE-1’s resistance against intestinal degra￾dation [19]. Elastase 1 in the stool specimens is highly
stable, and this test is noninvasive and more easily
applied in various clinical situations [20], which is parti￾cularly important for critically ill patients in the ICU.
Brydon et al. [21] previously found that elastase 1 can be
diluted or concentrated in variable degrees during the
intestinal passage, and drugs such as prokinetic and mor￾phine-derived agents were frequently prescribed in ICU,
which would undoubtedly affect the motility of the gastro￾intestinal tract and thus confound the results of FE-1 con￾centration. However, the primary endpoint of our present
study was to screen for EPI rather than to accurately

diagnose EPI, and FE-1 assay has been known to be the
preferred pancreatic function test for the screening of EPI
up to now [16]. Furthermore, as a typical clinical symptom
of EPI, the incidence of steatorrhea was significantly differ￾ent among the patients without EPI compared with mod￾erate or severe EPI in this study, suggesting that FE-1
assay was a reliable method to screen for EPI. In addition,
early EN, Jevity (EN suspension with dietary fibre) and
tube-feeding were chosen as the enteral feeding time, for￾mula and pathway, respectively, in our research protocols.
Although we did not determine whether these factors
affected the results of FE-1 concentration, it is unlikely
that these factors would impact the assessment of EPI, as
the same extent of influence on FE-1 concentration was
applied among all enrolled patients.
Previous studies have reported that the incidence of
elevated serum amylase and lipase activity in critically ill
patients without preexisting pancreatic diseases ranged
from 14% to 80% [9-11,22,23]. In our present study, the
proportions of critically ill adult patients with hyperamy￾lasemia and hyperlipasemia were 30.2% and 34.9%
respectively, indicating that the incidence of pancreatic
damage in ICU patients is around 30% to 40%. Interest￾ingly, the occurrence of EPI in critically ill adult patients,
as defined by less than 200 μg/g FE-1 concentration, was
more than 50%. This result was comparable to the data
reported in a recent study by Senkal et al. [24] and sug￾gested that the occurrence of EPI was much higher than
that of pancreatic damage in critically ill patients. More￾over, the huge gap between the occurrence of EPI and

pancreatic damage indicated that elevated serum pan￾creatic enzymes may not be an ideal indicator for the
assessment of EPI. This notion was also supported by
Tribl et al. [11], who disclosed that exocrine pancreatic
dysfunction existed without the elevation of serum pan￾creatic enzymes or histological evidence of pancreatic
damage.
With respect to the potential risk factors for EPI in ICU
adult patients receiving early EN, our results from both
multivariate logistic regression analysis and z-test simulta￾neously demonstrated that shock, sepsis, diabetes, cardiac
arrest, hyperlactacidemia, invasive mechanical ventilation
and CRRT were closely associated with the occurrence of
EPI. Indeed, many previous investigations have provided
direct or indirect evidence of the association between EPI
and these clinical characteristics. For example, acute
necrotizing pancreatitis has been reported in patients with
shock, even in the absence of characteristic clinical and
laboratory signs of acute pancreatitis [25]. The impairment
of exocrine pancreatic function was found in critically ill
patients with sepsis, and the extent of exocrine pancreatic
dysfunction was intimately related to the severity of sepsis
[26]. The prevalence of EPI in type 1 diabetes mellitus ran￾ged from 45% to 74%, and about 28% to 36% of patients
with type 2 diabetes mellitus had EPI [27]. In addition,
splanchnic hypoperfusion, mechanical ventilation and
CRRT have also been suggested as risk factors for
pancreatic damage in critically ill patients [9,11,23,28].
Surprisingly, anaemia, obesity, hypertriglyceridemia,
hyperbilirubinemia and brain injury due to severe trauma,
acute stroke or neurosurgery have also been suggested
as risk factors for pancreatic damage in ICU patients
[23,24,29,30]; however, no statistical differences were
found in our study. The causes are currently unknown but
might be attributable to different study populations and
research protocols.
It has been reported that malnutrition occurred in 38%
to 88% of ICU patients, which was associated with detri￾mental clinical outcomes [2]. To provide adequate EN,
current studies are focused mostly on the choice of deliv￾ery timing, formula selection and route of administration
[4]. Little attention has been paid to the potential contri￾bution of EPI to malnutrition. In this study, we found
that EPI was present in more than 50% of critically ill
adult patients without primary pancreatic diseases and
nearly 20% of them had severe EPI. If the patients with
preexisting EPI had also been included in this study, the
proportion of critically ill adult patients with EPI should
have been even higher. Hence, the status of exocrine pan￾creatic function in ICU patients should be considered
seriously when the intention is to prevent undernourish￾ment through EN, particularly for those patients with
severe EPI or those who have risk factors of EPI. A num￾ber of causes other than EPI may also contribute to mal￾nutrition, however, such as inadequate or unbalanced
diet, reduced absorption of nutrients and increased
energy consumption [31]. Moreover, Deane et al. [32]
recently reported that absorption at the luminal surface
is impaired and small luminal motility may affect lipid
absorption in critically ill patients. Therefore, improved
digestion of nutrients by pancreatic enzyme supplemen￾tation cannot guarantee that the occurrence of malab￾sorption and malnutrition will be avoided. Further
studies designed to investigate the effects of pancreatic
enzyme supplementation on malnutrition in critically ill
patients may help to elucidate the underlying association
between EPI and malnutrition.
Although our observational study has shown a high
prevalence of EPI and disclosed several risk factors for
EPI in a large cohort of heterogeneous critically ill
patients, a few limitations of the current report must be
mentioned. First, the assessment of steatorrheawas
based on clinical observation, but not 72-hour faecal fat
quantification, the gold standard for the diagnosis of
steatorrhea, although the latter has well-known handi￾caps limiting its clinical applicability [20]. Second, even
if elastase 1 has excellent resistance against intestinal
degradation [19], the degradation of elastase 1 during
the storage of stool samples might potentially have
affected the results of FE-1 concentration, as no control
stool samples were used to determine the historical
reference ranges of FE-1 concentration in this study.
Third, EPI was defined as a cutoff concentration of FE-1
less than 200 μg/g in the present study, which means
that continuous variables were converted into categori￾cal variables to divide patients into different groups;

thus, this procedure had inherent limitations that may
result in lost information and reduced power of statisti￾cal tests [33].
Conclusion
EPI, as measured by FE-1 concentration, was present in
more than 50% of critically ill adult patients without pri￾mary pancreatic diseases, and almost 20% of them could
be diagnosed as having severe EPI. This finding suggests
that EPI might be another critical contributor to malnu￾trition in addition to insufficient nutritional delivery in
ICU patients, especially in patients with severe EPI or
risk factors for EPI, which consist of shock, sepsis, dia￾betes, cardiac arrest, hyperlactacidemia, invasive mechan￾ical ventilation and haemodialysis.
Key messages
• As measured by FE-1 concentration, EPI occurred
in 52.2% of critically ill adult patients without preex￾isting pancreatic diseases, and nearly one-fifth of
them could be diagnosed as having severe EPI.
• The occurrence of EPI in critically ill adult patients
was closely correlated to clinical characteristics such
as shock, sepsis, diabetes, cardiac arrest, hyperlacta￾cidemia, invasive mechanical ventilation and CRRT.
• The status of exocrine pancreatic function in criti￾cally ill patients should be considered seriously when
the intention is to prevent undernourishment
through EN, especially for patients with severe EPI or
who have risk factors for EPI.
