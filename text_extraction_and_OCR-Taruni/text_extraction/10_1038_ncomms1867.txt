It is generally accepted that the de-differentiation of smooth muscle cells, from the contractile 
to the proliferative/synthetic phenotype, has an important role during vascular remodelling 
and diseases. Here we provide evidence that challenges this theory. We identify a new type 
of stem cell in the blood vessel wall, named multipotent vascular stem cells. Multipotent 
vascular stem cells express markers, including Sox17, Sox10 and S100β, are cloneable, have 
telomerase activity, and can differentiate into neural cells and mesenchymal stem cell-like 
cells that subsequently differentiate into smooth muscle cells. On the other hand, we perform 
lineage tracing with smooth muscle myosin heavy chain as a marker and find that multipotent 
vascular stem cells and proliferative or synthetic smooth muscle cells do not arise from the 
de-differentiation of mature smooth muscle cells. In response to vascular injuries, multipotent 
vascular stem cells, instead of smooth muscle cells, become proliferative, and differentiate 
into smooth muscle cells and chondrogenic cells, thus contributing to vascular remodelling 
and neointimal hyperplasia. These findings support a new hypothesis that the differentiation 
of multipotent vascular stem cells, rather than the de-differentiation of smooth muscle cells, 
contributes to vascular remodelling and diseases.

Vascular diseases are a leading cause of death in many coun￾tries. The development of vascular diseases, such as inti￾mal hyperplasia and atherosclerosis, involves proliferation 
and migration of vascular cells1–4. Vascular smooth muscle cells 
(SMCs) are the predominant cell type in the tunica media of the 
blood vessel wall. Studies from many laboratories have shown that 
cultured SMCs and SMCs in the neointima ‘lose’ the expression of 
smooth muscle myosin heavy chain (SM-MHC), a marker of con￾tractile SMCs, and become proliferative and synthetic5–10. A widely 
accepted explanation is that SMCs have phenotypic plasticity and 
that mature or contractile SMCs can de-differentiate into prolif￾erative and synthetic SMCs4,11–13. However, this de-differentiation 
process has not been directly demonstrated by tracking the fate of 
mature or contractile SMCs.
Over the past decade, several types of SMC-related vascular pro￾genitors in the blood vessels have been identified14,15. In the tunica 
media, mesenchymal stem cells (MSC)-like cells can be isolated from 
SMC population, which express CD29 and CD44, and have multilin￾eage potential for osteogenic and chondrogenic differentiation but 
not for adipogenic differentiation16,17. In adventitia, Sca-1+ pro￾genitors can differentiate into SMCs and contribute to atheroscle￾rosis of vein grafts in ApoE-deficient mice18. In addition, CD146+
perivascular MSC-like cells demonstrate osteogenic, chondrogenic 
and adipogenic potentials19. Furthermore, evidence exists that 
vascular endothelial cells (EC) can be converted into MSC-like cells 
by an activin-like kinase-2 receptor-dependent mechanism20. How￾ever, the characterization of these vascular progenitors is limited 
to nonspecific surface markers, and whether these vascular pro￾genitors have an important role in the generation of proliferative or 
synthetic SMCs and the development of vascular diseases remains 
unclear.
In this study, we isolate cells from the tunica media of the blood 
vessel wall and identify multipotent vascular stem cells (MVSCs) 
expressing markers such as Sox17, Sox10, S100β and neural fila￾ment-medium polypeptide (NFM). MVSCs can differentiate into 
MSC-like cells and subsequently SMCs. In addition, MVSCs and 
MSC-like cells respond differently to vascular growth factors. 
Importantly, lineage-tracing experiments show that MVSCs and 
proliferative or synthetic SMCs are not derived from mature SMCs. 
In response to vascular injury, MVSCs become proliferative and 
contribute significantly to vascular remodelling and neointima for￾mation. These findings define a novel MVSC-MSC-SMC differenti￾ation pathway, and support a new hypothesis that the differentiation 
of MVSCs instead of the de-differentiation of SMCs contributes to 
vascular remodelling and diseases.
Results
Identification and characterization of rat MVSCs. First, we 
verified the existence of SM-MHC− cells in the tunica media by 
immunostaining the cross-sections of carotid arteries from Sprague 
Dawley (SD) rats for smooth muscle α-actin (SMA) and SM-MHC. 
As shown in Supplementary Fig. S1, the majority of cells inside the 
elastic lamina layers were mature and contractile SMCs (SMA+/SM￾MHC+), whereas a small population (less than 10%) were negative 
for SM-MHC in the tunica media.
We then isolated and characterized the cells from the tunica 
media of carotid arteries of SD rats. Using enzymatic digestion, 
we obtained a mixed cell population including both mature SMCs 
and non-SMCs. The mature SMCs had SM-MHC and calponin-1 
(CNN1) assembled into stress fibres and were non-proliferative 
(negative for Ki67) (Fig. 1a–c). By contrast, the SM-MHC− cells 
were smaller, had no SM-MHC, CNN1 or SMA in stress fibres, 
expressed low level of SMA, and were highly proliferative (Fig. 1b–c). 
After being cultured in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) 
for 3 days, the SM-MHC− cells started to multiply (Supplementary 
Fig. S2) and eventually dominated the culture.
With the tissue explant culture method, which relies on cell 
migration, only migratory and proliferative cells can be isolated. 
The cells migrating out of the tunica media expressed Ki67 and low 
levels of SMA, but did not express SM-MHC or CNN1 (Fig. 1d￾f). These cells had the same characteristics as the SM-MHC− cells 
isolated using the enzymatic digestion method. In the previous 
literature, these SM-MHC− cells were defined as synthetic and/or 
proliferative SMCs21. However, a detailed characterization showed 
that the SM-MHC− cells exhibited significant changes in mor￾phology, during the culture for an extended period. As shown in 
Supplementary Fig. S3, the size of cell nucleus and the spreading area 
of the cells increased significantly (greater than threefold) within a 
30-day time period, accompanied by the increase of stress fibres (Fig. 
1g-i) and the increased expression of SMA and CNN1 (Fig. 1j-k). 
These results suggest that the proliferative/synthetic SMCs might be 
derived from the spontaneous differentiation of SM-MHC− cells in 
the medium with 10% FBS.
To thoroughly characterize these SM-MHC− cells at the early 
stage (day 3) of primary tissue explant culture, we screened protein￾marker expression with over 50 antibodies (Supplementary Table 
S1), and found that isolated SM-MHC− cells uniformly expressed 
markers including neural crest cell markers Sox10, Sox1, Snail, 
vimentin and nestin, endoderm marker Sox17, neural cell makers 
NFM, peripherin, Brn3a, Phox2b and glia cell marker S100β (Fig. 
1l–s; Supplementary Table S1), and general MSC makers includ￾ing CD29 and CD44 (Fig. 1t,u). In addition, these SM-MHC− cells 
were negative for CD146 and Sca-1 (Fig. 1v,w), suggesting that 
these cells were distinct from previously identified perivascular 
MSC-like cells19 or Sca-1+ progenitors18,22. These cells were also 
negative for markers for EC and EC conversion-derived MSC-like 
cells, for example, CD31/PECAM1 and VE-cadherin23, as well as 
the endothelial progenitor cell and haematopoietic stem cell mark￾ers CD34, CD133, c-Kit and Flk-1 (Supplementary Table S1).
To maintain the phenotype of these SM-MHC− cells, we 
performed screening for maintenance medium, and found a modi￾fied medium for neural crest stem cell (NCSC) culture that could 
maintain the cell morphology and the expression of aforemen￾tioned markers in the SM-MHC− cells. The maintenance medium 
contained DMEM with 2% chick embryo extract, 1% FBS, and 
20ngml−1 of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), and was used 
to expand the cells for further analysis.
We further determined whether they were capable of differen￾tiating into ectodermal and mesodermal lineages by treating cells 
with specific differentiation induction media24–28. Indeed, these 
SM-MHC− cells were capable of differentiating into Schwann cells 
(positive for glial fibrillary acidic protein, GFAP+), peripheral 
neurons (positive for neuron-specific class III β-tubulin, that is, 
TUJ1+), SMCs (SM-MHC+), chondrocytes (alcian blue staining), 
adipocytes (oil red staining) and osteoblasts (alizarin red staining) 
(Fig. 2a-f).
The capability of the SM-MHC− cells differentiation into neural 
cells was also demonstrated in vivo. We isolated SM-MHC− cells 
from tunica media of carotid arteries of GFP rats, and transplanted 
them into a nerve conduit to bridge transected sciatic nerve, as 
described25. After 1 month, immunostaining of the longitudinal￾sections showed that GFP labelled cells differentiated into Schwann 
cells and contributed to axon myelination, as evident by myelin 
basic protein expression (Supplementary Fig. S4).
These results indicate that these SM-MHC− cells in blood vessel 
wall are multipotent. Therefore, we defined these cells as MVSCs. 
MVSCs could be isolated from the tunica media of different blood 
vessels including jugular vein, aorta, abdominal artery, inferior 
vena cava, femoral artery and femoral vein beside carotid artery 
(Supplementary Fig. S5), but not from adventitia layer, endothe￾lium, or fat tissue around blood vessels using tissue explant culture 
method.

Single-cell cloning and telomerase activity assay. To further confirm 
the stemness of MVSCs, we performed a cloning assay (Fig. 2g). Dilu￾tional cell cloning assay showed that the average plating efficiency of 
MVSCs was about 13%, and the cloned MVSCs retained the marker 
expression, as described in Supplementary Table S1, including Sox10, 
Sox17 (Fig. 2h-i) and other MVSC markers (as exemplified in Supple￾mentary Fig. S6a–f), and could self-renew and maintain the multipo￾tency (Supplementary Fig. S6g–l). To determine whether MVSCs had 
the capability to form neural spheres as neural crest cells24,25,29, rat 
MVSCs derived from cloning assay were cultured on ultralow-attach￾ment plates. Indeed, MVSCs formed neural sphere-like aggregates 
(Supplementary Fig. S7a), and the cells within the spheres retained 
the expression of the MVSC markers such as Sox17, vimentin, SMA, 
nestin and S100β (Supplementary Fig. S7b-f).
We then determined whether blood vessels and isolated MVSCs 
possess telomerase activity. Surprisingly, all blood vessels examined 
had telomerase activity, suggesting the presence of stem cells in the 
vascular wall (Fig. 2j). The isolated MVSCs had a marked increase 
(>100 fold) of telomerase activity compared with the respective 
vascular tissues from which the cells were isolated, suggesting the 
enrichment and purification of stem cells from vascular tissues, dur￾ing the cell isolation process. Furthermore, we found no significant 
difference in telomerase activity in MVSCs isolated from different 
blood vessels.

We used carotid artery and jugular vein as representatives to 
further compare the MVSCs from different blood vessels. DNA 
microarray showed that MVSCs from carotid arteries and jugular 
veins were almost identical (Fig. 2k), whereas only 3.6% of genes in 
expression showed significant difference of more than twofold (Sup￾plementary Table S2), suggesting that MVSCs derived from arteries 
and veins were similar. DNA microarray also showed that MVSCs 
expressed non-specific MSC markers such as CD29, CD44, CD73 
and CD90 (Supplementary Table S3).
MVSCs did not arise from the de-differentiation of SMCs. Our 
results suggest that previously identified proliferative/synthetic 
SMCs could be MVSCs and/or their derivatives following spontane￾ous differentiation in regular culture media. To directly determine 
whether MVSCs were derived from the de-differentiation of mature 
SMCs, we performed lineage tracing using SM-MHC as a marker 
in the SM-MHC-Cre/LoxP-enhanced green fluorescence protein 
(EGFP) mice30–32. Immunostaining showed that less than 10% of 
the cells in the carotid arterial tunica media of SM-MHC-Cre/LoxP￾EGFP mice were not labelled with EGFP, indicating the existence 
of a small population of non-SMCs in the tunica media (Fig. 3a), 
consistent with the observation in the rat model (Supplementary 
Fig. S1). Immunostaining for Cre and EGFP further showed that the 
EGFP− cells did not express Cre (Supplementary Fig. S8).
With enzymatic digestion culture, majority (about 92%) of the 
cells isolated from the carotid arteries of SM-MHC-Cre/LoxP-EGFP 
mice were EGFP+ cells (Fig. 3b). However, after being cultured and 
passaged in DMEM with 10% FBS for 10 days, all the cells in culture 
were EGFP− (Fig. 3c), indicating that these cells were not derived 
from mature SMCs.
In addition, in tissue explant culture, migratory and prolif￾erative cells were EGFP− in contrast to strong EGFP fluorescence 
in the arterial tunica media (Fig. 3d,e). Flow cytometry also 
confirmed that none of the derived vascular cells expressed EGFP, 
which indicated that proliferative and migratory cells isolated 
from tunica media of blood vessels were not derived from the 
de-differentiation of mature SMCs (Fig. 3f). The lack of EGFP 
expression in MVSCs was unlikely due to the suppression of Rosa26 
promoter activity in cell culture33. When SM-MHC-Cre/LoxP￾EGFP mice were generated using β-actin (instead of ROSA26) 
promoter to drive the EGFP expression, tissue explant culture 
showed that cells derived from these mice did not express EGFP, 
while vascular cells in the tissue explant expressed EGFP (Supple￾mentary Fig. S9).
To determine whether these EGFP− cells were similar to rat 
MVSCs, immunostaining and differentiation assay were per￾formed. Immunostaining showed that these EGFP− cells uniformly 
expressed the same MVSC markers including Sox10 (Fig. 3g), Sox17, 
Sox1, Snail, vimentin, S100β and NFM (Supplementary Fig. S10). In 
addition, these cells could be induced to differentiate into Schwann 
cells (GFAP+/S100β+), peripheral neurons (TUJ1+/peripherin+), 
chondrocytes (alcian blue+), adipocytes (oil red+) and osteoblasts 
(alizarin red+) (Fig. 3h–l), which further confirmed that EGFP−
cells in tunica media were MVSCs.

To determine whether MVSCs could differentiate into 
mature SMCs and turn on EGFP expression, we activated Notch 
signalling by co-culturing EGFP − MVSCs with OP9-Delta1 
feeder cells34. After 2 weeks of co-culture, majority of the MVSCs 
showed strong green fluorescence (Fig. 3m). Immunostaining for 
SM-MHC confirmed that MVSCs indeed differentiated into SM￾MHC+ SMCs (Supplementary Fig. S11a-c). The fact that EGFP 
could be turned on after MVSCs differentiated into SMCs further 
confirmed that MVSCs are not derived from de-differentiation 
of contractile SMCs. Interestingly, a small portion of the EGFP +
cells expressed proliferation marker Ki67 (Supplementary Fig. 
S11d-f), suggesting that newly differentiated SMCs had not exit 
cell cycle yet.
To test whether MVSCs could differentiate into mature SMCs 
and turn on EGFP expression in vivo, we embedded MVSCs in 
collagen gel on the outer surface of a nanofibrous vascular graft, 
and implanted the grafts into athymic rats by performing carotid 
artery anastomosis35,36. After 1 month, immunostaining of the 
cross-sections showed that a small portion of the cells expressed 
EGFP, suggesting that MVSCs could differentiate into mature SMCs 
in vivo (Supplementary Fig. S12).
Previous lineage-tracing experiments showed that neural crest 
cells only contributed to the development of carotid artery, aortic 
arch and large arteries close to the heart37. To determine whether 
MVSCs from different vascular beds were derived from neural crest, 
we isolated MVSCs from arteries and veins in Wnt1-Cre/LoxP-LacZ 
mice. MVSCs derived from carotid arteries showed positive X-Gal 
staining whereas cells derived from jugular veins were negative 
(Fig. 3n–o), indicating that MVSCs are not necessarily derived from 
the neural crest origin.
MVSCs-MSC-SMC differentiation pathway . As shown in Figs 1g–k, 
2c and 3m, MVSCs could differentiate into SMCs, and the cells at 
various stages of differentiation could contribute to the heterogene￾ity of SMCs. It is also possible that previously identified MSC-like 
cells could be derived from MVSCs. Therefore, we examined the

spontaneous differentiation of MVSCs by culturing the freshly iso￾lated MVSCs for 8 weeks in DMEM with 10% FBS.
As shown in Fig. 4a,b, MVSCs were negative for CNN1 and SM￾MHC. After 3 weeks, MVSCs expressed CNN1 but lost the nuclear 
expression of Sox17 (Sox17−/Sox10+/CNN1+/SM-MHC−) (Fig. 
4c-d). At this stage, the cells lost the capability of differentiating into 
peripheral neurons and Schwann cells, but retained the potential for 
SMC, ostogenic, chondrogenic and adipogenic differentiation, simi￾lar to previously reported MSC-like cells. These results suggested 
that MVSCs could be the precursor of MSC-like cells identified in 
blood vessel by previous studies16,17,38.
In addition, after being cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS for 8 
weeks, the cells lost the expression of Sox17 and Sox10 and spon￾taneously differentiated into mature SMCs (CNN1+/SM-MHC+) 
(Fig. 4e–f). These cells also lost the differentiation potential into 
neural and mesenchymal lineages (summarized in Fig. 4g). These 
results suggested that long-term culture in the medium contain￾ing 10% FBS resulted in the spontaneous differentiation of MVSCs 
into MSC-like cells and subsequently SMCs, and that the cells at 
the various stages of differentiation might explain the heterogeneity 
of SMCs.
Differential response of MVSCs and differentiated cells. MVSCs 
at different stages of differentiation might respond differently to the 
same stimulation in the vascular microenvironment. To address 
this issue, we compared the effects of three vascular growth factors 
on undifferentiated MVSCs and MSC-like cells (3-week differen￾tiation), as an example. The vascular growth factors used in this 
study included bFGF, platelet-derived growth factors-B (PDGF-B) 
and transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1). PDGF-B and bFGF 
increased the proliferation of both MVSCs and MSC-like cells, while 
TGF-β1 suppressed the proliferation of MVSCs (Fig. 5a). It was also 
noted that PDGF had more dramatic effect on the proliferation of 
MSC-like cells compared with MVSCs.
Quantitative PCR (qPCR) showed that MSC-like cells had much 
lower expression of MVSC marker such as Sox17 and higher expres￾sion of immature SMC markers such as SMA and CNN1 (Fig. 5b,e,f). 
bFGF significantly increased Sox17 expression while suppressed the 
expression of SMC markers including SMA and CNN1 of MVSCs 
(Fig. 5b,e,f), suggesting that bFGF might help maintain MVSCs at 
undifferentiated state. However, bFGF had no significant effect on 
the expression of Sox17, SMA and CNN1 but increased the synthe￾sis of aggrecan (Fig. 5d) in MSC-like cells, suggesting that bFGF 
might promote a synthetic SMC phenotype in MSC-like cells.
PDGF-B also suppressed the expression of SMC markers of 
MVSCs (Fig. 5e,f), but did not show any effect on Sox17 expression 
(Fig. 5b). In MSC-like cells, PDGF increased aggrecan synthesis 
and CNN1 expression, but had no effect on the expression of SMA 
(Fig. 5d-f).
TGF-β1 significantly increased the expression of SMA and CNN1 
in MVSCs (Fig. 5e,f), suggesting that TGF-β1 promoted MVSC dif￾ferentiation into SMC lineage. In MSC-like cells, TGF-β1 promoted 
synthetic SMC phenotype by increasing the synthesis of aggrecan 
(Fig. 5d), similar to bFGF and PDGF. These results demonstrated 
the MVSCs and differentiated cells responded differently to vascular 
growth factors.
MVSCs activation in vitro and in vivo. Cell proliferation and 
expansion are important in the development of vascular diseases. 
Therefore, we performed in vitro and in vivo studies to determine 
the transition of MVSCs from quiescent state to proliferative state. 
We first isolated MVSCs from carotid arteries of SD rats using enzy￾matic digestion method. Within 24h after cell isolation, immunos￾taining showed that MVSCs only expressed low levels of SMA, but 
not Sox10 or Ki67 (Fig. 6a), which indicated that MVSCs were qui￾escent in the blood vessels. However, after being cultured for another 
24h, MVSCs started expressing Sox10, as well as Ki67 (Fig. 6b, c), 
suggesting that MVSCs were activated and became proliferative.
Immunostaining also confirmed that the cells in the normal 
blood vessel wall did not express detectable level of MVSC markers 
(for example, Sox10, NFM or S100β) or proliferation marker Ki67 
(Fig. 6d–f, Supplementary Fig. S13a–f), suggesting that MVSCs 
were quiescent under normal physiological conditions. In response 
to vascular endothelial denudation injury39, about 50% of cells 
inside the elastic lamina layers of arterial media were found express￾ing Sox10 at day 5 after injury (Fig. 6g-i), and about 40% of Sox10+ Aggrecan expression

cells were positive for proliferative marker Ki67 (Fig. 6j-l). The per￾centage of proliferating cells is similar to what has been reported 
in the previous publications40–42. The Ki67+ cells were found only 
in Sox10+ MVSC population in tunica media, further confirming 
that MVSCs instead of SMCs could be activated to enter cell cycle 
on vascular injury. Of note, we also found Ki67-expressing cells in 
endothelial layer and adventitia layer after injury, indicating that 
ECs and adventitial cells were also activated to enter cell cycle for 
vascular remodelling. In addition, at day 5 after injury, the majority 
of the cells inside tunica media expressed MVSC cytoskeletal mark￾ers S100β and NFM (Fig. 6m–o), suggesting that MVSCs might have 
repopulated the tunica media following vascular injury and, possibly, 
SMC death. The difference in the relative percentage of Sox10+ cells 
and S100β+/NFM+ cells in the tunica media could be explained by 
the difference in the temporal expression of these genes.
MVSCs instead of SMCs contribute to vascular remodelling. To 
further investigate the fate of SMCs after vascular injury, we per￾formed endothelial denudation injury in the carotid artery of SM￾MHC-Cre/LoxP-EGFP mice. Immunostaining showed that the cells 
in native carotid artery express EGFP but not MVSC marker S100β
(Fig. 7a-c). Surprisingly, at day 5 after injury, the majority of the 
cells in tunica media expressed S100β instead of EGFP (Fig. 7d-f), 
which is consistent with previous notion that most SMCs may die 
by apoptosis while remaining cells proliferate and repopulate tunica 
media after vascular injury43,44. Although a low number of EGFP+
cells were found at this time point, none of them expressed pro￾liferation marker Ki67 (Supplementary Fig. S14), which further 
confirmed that mature SMCs were not able to de-differentiate to 
entry cell cycle. Thus, MVSCs, rather than SMCs, were activated and 
proliferated rapidly to repopulate the tunica media after injury and 
contributed to vascular remodelling.
The neointima formation was observed around day 15 after 
endothelial denudation injury in rat carotid arteries. Majority of the 
cells in the tunica media and neointima expressed MVSC makers 
including Sox10, NFM and S100β at day 15 and 30 (Fig. 7g–l; Sup￾plementary Fig. S13g–l), indicating that MVSCs were the major cell 
type in tunica media and neointima after vascular remodelling. In 
addition, the percentage of Ki67+ MVSCs inside the neointima was 
32% at day 15, and decreased to less than 1% at day 30, suggest￾ing a transient expansion of MVSCs in the vascular wall. Further￾more, around day 30, most of S100β+ cells also expressed SM-MHC 
(Fig. 7m-o) and some of the cells were still proliferating, which is 
consistent with the in vitro observation (Supplementary Fig. S11d–f) 
that the newly differentiated SM-MHC+ cells might have not exit 
cell cycle yet.
At 1 month post-injury, alcian blue staining and Verhoeff ’s 
staining showed significant deposition of aggrecan and collagen I, 
respectively, in neointima populated by MVSCs (Fig. 8a; Supple￾mentary Fig. S15a), suggesting that MVSCs-derived cells had a 
synthetic phenotype and contributed to the matrix synthesis dur￾ing neointima formation. Immunostaining showed that some of 
the MVSCs in neointima differentiated into chondrogenic cells 
(S100β+/collagen II+) (Supplementary Fig. S15b), which demon￾strated a novel mechanism of ectopic cartilage tissue formation in 
the injured blood vessels.
To determine whether there were still undifferentiated MVSCs 
in neointima, we isolated cells from neointima tissue 1 month after 
injury, using the explant culture method. Indeed, cells with same 
marker expression and differentiation potential as MVSCs could be 
derived from neointima tissues (Fig. 8b-i), suggesting that MVSCs 
were capable of self-renewal in vivo during vascular remodelling.
MVSCs exist in human blood vessels. To test whether MVSCs 
exist in human blood vessels, we used human carotid artery as a 
representative, and characterized the cells isolated by tissue explant 
culture. Indeed, MVSCs could be isolated from human arteries, and 
the cells expressed MVSC markers such as Sox10, Sox17, Pax-3/7,

vimentin, NFM and S100β (Fig. 8j–o). Similar to rodent MVSCs, 
human MVSCs can be induced to differentiate into Schwann cells, 
neuronal cells, SMCs, chondrocytes and adipocytes (Supplementary 
Fig. S16).
Discussion
The identification of MVSCs brings a new perspective on vascu￾lar remodelling and disease development. Our in vitro experi￾ments suggest that proliferative/synthetic SMCs are derived from 
the differentiation of MVSCs instead of the de-differentiation of 
mature SMCs. In vivo experiments also demonstrate that MVSCs, 
rather than mature SMCs, repopulate the tunica media and form 
neointima after endothelial denudation injury. These results pro￾vide the first direct evidence to support the MVSC differentia￾tion hypothesis and disprove the SMC de-differentiation theory. 
The fact that highly expandable and migratory MVSCs were not 
derived from mature SMCs suggests that the previously reported 
decrease of contractile markers in SMC culture in vitro, or after 
vascular injury in vivo, could be attributed to the rapid expan￾sion of MVSCs and their spontaneous differentiation into imma￾ture SMCs. MVSCs not only proliferate and differentiate, but also 
become synthetic and secrete matrix proteins such as collagen I, 
collagen II and aggrecan. The multipotential of MVSC differentia￾tion into SMCs, chondrogenic cells and other lineages offers a novel 
and reasonable explanation for the complex phenotypes of cells in 
the diseased vessel.
MVSCs at different stages of differentiation could also explain the 
heterogeneity of SMC in culture and in vivo. The fact that MVSCs 
and their derivatives respond differently to vascular growth factors 
underscores the importance of characterizing the cell culture from 
blood vessels. In the literature, the differentiation stage of SMCs is 
usually not well characterized. For example, the cells positive for 
SMA, SM-22α and CNN1 are often treated as SMCs, rather than 
immature SMCs or partially differentiated MVSCs. In many studies, 
the cells in culture may not be homogeneous at a specific differentia￾tion stage, which may result in conflicting observations and expla￾nation. Previous studies have identified a subpopulation of SMCs, 
termed ‘epithelioid’ cells, from newborn or injured vessels45–48. The 
origin of these SMCs is not known, and the relationship of ‘epithe￾lioid’ cells with vascular stem cells has not been explored. It is very 
likely that ‘epithelioid’ SMCs are derived from MVSCs. However, in 
adults, MVSCs can be isolated from both normal vessels and injured 
vessels, but ‘epithelioid’ SMCs are only derived from injured vessels. 
It is possible that dormant MVSCs are a small population in normal 
vessels and may have been overlooked in previous studies.
In addition to proliferative/synthetic SMCs, MVSCs could dif￾ferentiate into mature SMCs (SM-MHC+) in vitro and in vivo. It 
is also worth noting that the extent of MVSC activation, prolif￾eration and differentiation could be dependent on the extent of 
vascular injury and SMC damage42. However, a recent study 
using SM-MHC as a marker for lineage tracing demonstrates that 
neointima contains proliferative cells derived from mature SMCs at 
3 weeks following vascular injury49. There are two possible expla￾nations for this apparent discrepancy. First, these proliferating cells 
could be derived from MVSCs after such a long time period. Indeed, 
we have shown that newly differentiated SMCs (SM-MHC+) may not 
have exited the cell cycle completely (Supplementary Fig. S11d–f). 
In addition, at an earlier time point (for example, within a week), 
we never detected proliferating cells positive for SM-MHC (Fig. 1c). 
Second, the two transgenic mouse lines of SM-MHC-Cre, used for 
the lineage tracing of SMCs, were generated independently30,50. 
We cannot exclude the possibility that a subtle difference in the

promoter of SM-MHC in these two mouse lines exists. Although 
both mouse lines have been verified with extensive characteriza￾tion and should be appropriate for tracing the fate of mature SMCs, 
further studies are needed to directly compare these mouse lines. 
Another study on the lineage tracing of SMCs shows that SMCs 
give rise to osteogenic and chondrogenic cells in arteries17. How￾ever, SM22α instead of SM-MHC was used as the marker for lineage 
tracing in this study. Because SM22α is also expressed in MVSCs 
and their derivatives, this study may not distinguish the source of 
the cells between MVSCs and SMCs.
Another important finding is that MVSCs are the cell type in 
tunica media that can be activated by vascular injury to prolifer￾ate and participate in remodelling. Neointima cells have a large cell 
body, secrete extracellular matrix (ECM) and express lower levels of 
the smooth muscle-specific contractile proteins51, which is consist￾ent with our findings on the changes of cell morphology and the 
expression of SMC markers during the spontaneous differentiation 
of MVSCs. In this study, we showed that MVSCs, instead of SMCs, 
are the major cell type in neointimal tissue as characterized by 
MVSC makers. Given the fact that some MVSCs in neointima still 
retain multipotency, it is reasonable to propose that aberrant acti￾vation, expansion and differentiation of MVSCs may contribute to 
not only SMC differentiation and cartilage formation but also many 
other aspects of vascular diseases such as fat and cholesterol metab￾olism, matrix remodelling and calcification. As the rodent model of 
denudation injury does not result in significant fat and cholesterol 
accumulation and intima calcification, the possibility of MVSC dif￾ferentiation into adipogenic and osteogenic cells in diseased vessels 
remains to be tested using atherosclerosis models. The identification 
of MVSC in human arteries makes MVSC a potential therapeutic 
target of vascular diseases.
MVSCs in arteries and veins may have different developmental 
origins. Wnt1 lineage-tracing experiments suggest that MVSCs in 
carotid arteries may be neural crest origin. In contrast, for blood 
vessels not developed from neural crest (for example, jugular vein), 
MVSCs are negative for Wnt1. It is possible that these MVSCs are 
derived from other germ layers such as mesoderm. Nevertheless, 
MVSCs from carotid arteries and jugular veins have similar gene 
expression profile, suggesting that MVSCs in different vascular 
beds, regardless of their developmental origins, may share simi￾lar characteristics. In addition, MVSCs are different from NCSCs 
because MVSCs do not express some NCSC markers such as p75, 
HNK1, Slug or AP2 (refs 25,52–54).
To date, MVSCs are a unique precursor identified for adult 
MSC-like cells, and MSC precursors similar to MVSCs probably 
exist in many other tissues. MVSCs express CD29 and CD44, two 
nonspecific surface markers of MSCs and SMCs. However, there 
was no specific marker, especially no transcriptional factor marker, 
for MSCs. In this study, we have identified several transcriptional 
markers and cytoskeletal markers in MVSCs, such as Sox17, Sox10, 
nestin, NFM and S100β. In addition, we showed that MSC-like cells 
were also positive for some of these markers (except Sox17). These 
results provide insight into the characteristics of MVSCs and MSC￾like cells, not only in blood vessels, but also in other tissue types.
This study supports a new hypothesis that MVSC activation 
and differentiation, instead of SMC de-differentiation, results in

the proliferative and synthetic cells in the vascular wall, and that 
the aberrant activation and differentiation of MVSCs may play 
an important role in the development of vascular diseases. These 
findings provide unprecedented insight into the role of stem cells 
in vascular diseases and remodelling, which suggests that vascular 
diseases are stem cell diseases. These findings may have transforma￾tive impact on vascular biology and diseases, and may lead to new 
therapies using MVSCs as a therapeutic target.
Methods
Generation of transgenic mice and genotyping. Animal studies were approved 
by the ACUC committee at UC Berkeley, and were carried out according to the 
institutional guidelines. Transgenic mice, expressing Cre recombinase under the 
control of the SM-MHC promoter were mated with transgenic mice with a 
construct of Rosa26-LoxP-EGFP or Actin-LoxP-EGFP (Jackson laboratory) to 
generate SM-MHC-Cre/LoxP-EGFP mice. Transgenic mice, expressing Cre recom￾binase under the control of the Wnt1 promoter were mated with Rosa26-LoxP￾LacZ mice to generate Wnt1-Cre/LoxP-LacZ mice. Genotyping was performed 
with PCR using total DNA extracted from mice tail tissues, as described 
previously30,31,55. The sequences of primers used for genotyping were shown in 
Supplementary Table S4.
Cell isolation. Cells were isolated from the blood vessels in rat, mouse and human. 
Human carotid arteries were obtained from National Disease Research Interchange 
(Philadelphia, PA). The cell isolation methods were described previously56. Briefly, 
the tissue segments were washed three times with PBS supplemented with 1% 
penicillin/streptomycin (P/S). The surrounding connective tissues and adventitia 
were dissected away under a dissecting microscope. Endothelium was removed 
by scraping off the cell layer on the luminal surface with sterile scalpel blades. For 
tissue explant culture method, the tunica media was cut into mm size and placed 
onto the surface coated with 1% CellStart (Invitrogen) in 6-well plates. The cells 
were cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS (Thermo Fisher Scientific), or in DMEM 
with 2% chick embryo extract (MP Biomedical), 1% FBS, 1% N2 (Invitrogen), 2% 
B27 (Invitrogen), 100nM retinoic acid (Sigma-Aldrich), 50nM 2-mercaptoethanol 
(Sigma-Aldrich), 1% P/S and 20ngml−1 bFGF (R&D Systems) (maintenance me￾dium). For enzymatic digestion methods, tissues were incubated with 3mgml−1
type II collagenase (Sigma-Aldrich) in DMEM with a 1/5 (w/v) ratio of tissue (g) 
to enzyme solution (ml). After incubation at 37 °C for 30min, the same volume of 
1mgml−1 elastase (Sigma-Aldrich) solution was added to the solution containing 
the tissue and collagenase. The tissues were incubated for another 1–2h until all 
the tissues were digested. Cells were then seeded onto CellStart-coated dishes and 
maintained at 37 °C in an incubator with 5% CO2.
Cell cloning assays. For the clonal assays, MVSCs were detached, and the cells 
were resuspended with maintenance medium and filtered through membranes 
with 40-µm pore size to obtain single cells. Filtered cells were seeded onto Cell￾Start-coated 96-well plates at the clonal density (1 cell per well) and cultured for 3 
weeks at 37 °C in an incubator with 5% CO2.
Sphere formation and differentiation assays. For sphere formation assay, cell 
suspension was plated onto ultralow-attachment 6-well plates (Corning). at the 
density of 0.5×106 cells per well in the presence of maintenance medium for 1 
week. The derived neural sphere-like aggregates were collected and embedded 
into optimal cutting temperature compound (Tissue Tek) for cryosectioning and 
immunostaining.
For the directed differentiation of MVSCs into peripheral neurons, Schwann 
cells, osteoblasts, adipocytes and chondrocytes, the cells were incubated in specific 
induction media, described previously, for 1–3 weeks24,25.
Telomerase activity assay. Telomerase activities of MVSCs and the tissues from 
which the cells were isolated were measured using telomeric repeats amplification 
protocol combined with real-time detection of amplification products, using a 
Quantitative Telomerase Detection kit (US Biomax), according to the instruction 
of the manufacturer. Total protein extract (0.5µg for each sample) was used in 
each reaction. Real-time PCR analysis was performed using an ABI PRISM 7,000 
Sequence Detection System. The amount of molecules was quantified using the 
standard curve, and normalized with the level of α-actin in each sample measured 
by an ELISA kit (Cell Signaling Technology).
Growth factor treatment and cell proliferation assay. Undifferentiated MVSCs 
and partially differentiated MVSCs (cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS for 3 
weeks) were starved in DMEM with 1% FBS for 24h. followed by the treatment 
of 10ngml−1 bFGF (Peprotech), 10ngml−1 PDGF-B (Peprotech) or 10ngml−1
TGF-β1 (Peprotech) for another 24h. The cell proliferation was quantified using 
Click-iT EdU Alexa Fluor 488 HCS Assay kit (Invitogen), according to the instruc￾tion of the manufacturer.
RNA isolation for oligonucleotide microarray and qPCR. MVSCs derived 
from carotid arteries and jugular veins of SD rats were lysed with Trizol reagent 
(Invitrogen). and total RNA was extracted as previously described36. For micro￾array analysis, the RNA pellet was resuspended in nuclease-free H2O and was 
subsequently diluted to a concentration of 0.50 mg ml−1. Then, 10µl of each 
sample was used for the analysis using an Affymetrix oligonucleotide microarray 
U133AA of Av2 chip containing 31,099 probe sets. Samples were labelled and 
hybridized according to Affymetrix protocols. Signal intensities were obtained 
for all probe sets and were organized using GeneTraffic version 3.2 microarray 
analysis software (Iobion).
For qPCR, RNA pellets were resuspended in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated 
H2O. Complementary DNA was synthesized using two-step reverse transcription 
with the ThermoScript RT–PCR system (Invitrogen), followed by qPCR 
with SYBR green reagent and the ABI Prism 7,000 Sequence Detection System 
(Applied Biosystems). The sequences of the primers used in this study are shown 
in Supplementary Table S5.
Carotid artery endothelial denudation model. The rat and mouse carotid arter￾ies were subjected to endothelial denudation injury as described previously39. 
Briefly, adult SD rats or transgenic mice were anaesthetized with isoflurane. 
Endoluminal injury to the left common carotid artery was produced by custom￾made wire probes that consisted of a 10-cm long stainless steel wire soldered with 
a copper-beaded tip. Rats or mice were sacrificed at 5, 15 and 30 days after injury, 
with at least 6 animals for each time point. The blood vessels samples were rinsed 
with PBS and embedded in optimal cutting temperature compound for histologi￾cal analysis.
In vivo transplantation. Electrospinning technique was used to produce 
vascular grafts and nerve conduits as previously described25,35,36,57. For cell 
transplantation into nerve conduits, MVSCs were isolated using tissue explant 
culture method from the carotid arteries of GFP rats. The cell suspension was 
mixed with cold matrigel solution at a 2:1 ratio (volume to volume), and injected 
into the nerve conduits. The tissue-engineered constructs were kept in the 
incubator for 1h to allow gelation. The nerve conduit was inserted between 
the two nerve stumps and sutured, creating a gap of 1 cm between the 
two stumps.
For the transplantation of MVSCs into microfibrous vascular grafts, MVSCs 
were derived from the carotid arteries of MHC-Cre/LoxP-EGFP mice using the 
tissue explant culture method. MVSCs were mixed with neutralized collagen 
solution (2mgml−1; diluted in MVSC maintenance medium), resulting in a cell 
density at 1million cells per 0.5ml. The collagen gel solution (with cells) was then 
used to fill in the space outside of the vascular graft in a 1-ml syringe and allowed 
to polymerize at 37 °C for 1h. Then DMEM with 10% FBS containing 10ngml−1
TGF-β1 was added into the syringe to cover the grafts. After 1-day culture, the gel 
was contracted by the embedded cells and attached tightly onto the outer surface 
of the graft. The vascular grafts with cells were then transplanted into athymic rats 
using carotid artery anastomosis.
Staining and histological analysis. For immunostaining, cells or the tissue sec￾tions of blood vessels were fixed with 4% PFA, permeabilized with 0.5% Triton-100 
(Sigma-Aldrich), and blocked with 1% BSA (Sigma-Aldrich). For actin cytoskel￾eton staining, samples were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated 
phalloidin (Invitrogen) for 30min to stain filamentous actin (F-actin). For the 
staining of other cell markers, samples were incubated with specific primary 
antibodies (Supplementary Table S1) for 2h at room temperature, washed with PBS 
for 3 times, and incubated with appropriate Alexa 488- and/or Alexa 546-labelled 
secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes). Nuclei were stained with 4,6-diamidino￾2-phenylindole (DAPI) (Invitrogen). Fluorescence images were collected by a Zeiss 
LSM710 confocal microscope.
For organic dye staining, cells or the tissue sections were fixed with 4% PFA 
for 30min, washed and stained with alizarin red (Sigma-Aldrich), alcian blue 
(Sigma-Aldrich), oil red (Sigma-Aldrich) or Verhoeff ’s dye (American MasterTech) 
according to the instruction of the manufacturers. Images were collected by a Zeiss 
Axioskop 2 plus microscope.
Flow cytometry analysis. For flow cytometry analysis, cells were dissociated after 
the exposure to 0.2% EDTA for 20min at room temperature. The cells in suspen￾sion were blocked with 1% BSA, incubated with specific primary antibodies, and 
then stained with secondary antibodies. Negative control sample was incubated 
with a nonspecific antibody with the same isotype as the specific primary antibody, 
and stained with the same secondary antibody. 7-AAD (BD Pharmingen) was used 
to exclude dead cells. Cells were analysed using FACScan flow cytometer (Becton 
Dickinson) and FlowJo software (Tree Star).
Statistics. Data were reported as means±s.d., unless otherwise indicated. All 
experiments were repeated at least three times. Comparisons among values for all 
groups were performed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Holm’s t-test 
was used for the analysis of differences between different groups. Significance level 
was set as P<0.05.
