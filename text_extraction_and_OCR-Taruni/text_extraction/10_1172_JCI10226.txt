Introduction
During each of several recent years, more than 6 mil￾lion people worldwide died of ischemic heart disease,
and ischemic heart disease is predicted to be the lead￾ing cause of individual deaths the world over in the
near future (1). Although treatments for ischemic
heart disease such as recanalization therapy have pro￾gressed, reperfusion treatment often makes way for
myocardial injury by increasing inflammatory
responses. There is a growing body of evidence that
apoptosis of cardiomyocytes is one of the major con￾tributors to myocardial infarction and to
ischemia/reperfusion injury (2–4). As apoptosis occurs
within 24 hours and induces massive or submassive
losses of myocytes, the susceptibility to cardiac dys￾function increases (5). Therefore, if cardiomyocyte
apoptosis could be inhibited, cardiac pathophysiolo￾gy and dysfunction due to myocardial infarction and
ischemia/reperfusion injury could be minimized.
HGF, originally purified and cloned as a potent
mitogen for hepatocytes (6, 7), has mitogenic, moto￾genic, morphogenic, and antiapoptotic activities in
various cell types (8–12). Pluripotent activities of HGF
are mediated by a membrane-spanning tyrosine kinase
receptor encoded by the c-met proto-oncogene (13, 14).
Physiologically, HGF plays a role as an organotrophic
factor for regeneration and protection, including the
liver (15, 16), kidney (17, 18), and lung (19, 20).
Although anti–cell death actions of HGF were initial￾ly implicated by findings that laboratory animals given
HGF after acute induced hepatic or renal injury had
much less histological damage and more satisfactory
organ functions, subsequent studies extended this
anti–cell death activity of HGF to a variety of cells,
including renal epithelial cells and neurons (21, 22), as
well as hepatocytes (23, 24).
Previous studies showed that HGF and c-Met mRNA
were transiently upregulated in the myocardium during
heart development in mice (25) and plasma levels of
HGF were markedly elevated in patients with acute
myocardial infarction (26). We recently reported that
HGF gene transfection into the myocardium attenuat￾ed ischemia/reperfusion injury in isolated perfused rat
hearts (27); however, whether HGF plays a cardiotroph￾ic role in pathophysiological conditions and has thera￾peutic potential in cardiac ischemia/reperfusion injury
remained to be addressed. Using two distinct approach￾es, biological neutralization of endogenous HGF and
supplement of recombinant HGF, we now provide evi￾dence that endogenous HGF is cardioprotective and
exogenous HGF attenuates ischemia/reperfusion injury
by directly protecting cardiomyocytes.

Using a rat model of ischemia/reperfusion injury, we demonstrate here that HGF is cardioprotec￾tive due to its antiapoptotic effect on cardiomyocytes. Following transient myocardial ischemia
and reperfusion, c-Met/HGF receptor expression rapidly increased in the ischemic myocardium,
an event accompanied by a dramatic increase in plasma HGF levels in the infarcted rats. When
endogenous HGF was neutralized with a specific antibody, the number of myocyte cell deaths
increased markedly, the infarct area expanded, and the mortality increased to 50%, as compared
with a control group in which there was no mortality. Plasma from the myocardial infarcted rats
had cardioprotective effects on primary cultured cardiomyocytes, but these effects were signifi￾cantly diminished by neutralizing HGF. In contrast, recombinant HGF administration reduced the
size of infarct area and improved cardiac function by suppressing apoptosis in cardiomyocytes.
HGF rapidly augmented Bcl-xL expression in injured cardiomyocytes both in vitro and in vivo. As
apoptosis of cardiomyocytes is one of the major contributors to the pathogenesis in subjects with
ischemia/reperfusion injury, prevention of apoptosis may prove to be a reasonable therapeutic
strategy. Supplements of HGF, an endogenous cardioprotective factor, may be found clinically suit￾able in treating subjects with myocardial infarction.

Methods
Ischemia/reperfusion injury model. Myocardial
ischemia/reperfusion injury was induced, using 4-
week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats, as described (28).
The left coronary artery was ligated at the point 2 mm
distal from the ascending aorta. After 20 minutes of
occlusion, the ligature was released and blood flow
was visualized. Forty-eight hours after reperfusion, the
right carotid artery was cannulated with a microtip
catheter and the catheter was advanced into the left
ventricle (LV) to measure blood pressure. All animal
experiments were done in accordance with NIH guide￾lines, as dictated by the Animal Care Facility at Osaka
University Graduate School of Medicine.
Real-time quantitative RT-PCR. Total RNA was prepared
from the myocardial tissue, using TRIzol (Life Tech￾nologies Inc., Rockville, Maryland, USA). One µg of
total RNA was reverse-transcribed into first strand
cDNA with random hexaprimer using Superscript II
reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies Inc.). Quanti￾tative PCR was performed as described (29). Sequences
for primers and TaqMan fluorogenic probes (Perkin￾Elmer Biosystems, Foster City, California, USA) were as
follows: c-Met, forward primer, 5′-GTA CGG TGT CTC
CAG CAT TTT T-3′, reverse primer, 5′-AGA GCA CCA CCT
GCA TGA AG-3′, probe, 5′(FAM)-ACC ACG AGC ACT GTT
TCA ATA GGA CCC-(TAMRA)3′; GAPDH, forward
primer, 5′-CCA TCA CTG CCA CTC AGA AGA C-3′, reverse
primer, 5′-TCA TAC TTG GCA GGT TTC TCC A-3′, probe,
5′(FAM)-CGT GTT CCT ACC CCC AAT GTA TCC GT
(TAMRA)3′. Experimental samples were matched to a
standard curve generated by amplifying serially dilut￾ed products, using the same PCR protocol. To correct
for variability in RNA recovery and efficiency of reverse
transcription, GAPDH cDNA was amplified and quan￾titated in each cDNA preparation.
Recombinant HGF, anti–rat HGF antibody, and biochemi￾cal analysis. Human or rat recombinant HGF was puri￾fied from culture media of Chinese hamster ovary cells
transfected with an expression vector containing
human or rat HGF cDNA, respectively, as described (7).
The purity of HGF was >98%, as determined by SDS￾PAGE. Anti–rat HGF neutralizing antibody was pre￾pared as described elsewhere (30, 31), and the IgG frac￾tion was purified on a protein A-Sepharose column
(Pharmacia Biotech AB, Uppsala, Sweden). In cell scat￾tering assay with Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (an
authentic bioassay for HGF), 5 µg/ml of anti–rat HGF
IgG completely inhibited cell scattering induced by 5
ng/ml rat HGF, but not that induced by human HGF
(data not shown). Likewise, in cultured rat cardiomy￾ocytes, this antibody inhibited extracellular signal–reg￾ulated kinase (ERK) activation by rat HGF, but not that
by IGF-1, leukemia inhibitory factor, and bFGF (data
not shown). Moreover, no significant effects were seen
on survival, and no histological abnormalities were
seen in the liver, kidney, lung, and heart in the animals
when this antibody was administered into sham-oper￾ated rats (data not shown). HGF levels and creatine
phosphokinase (CPK) levels were measured using rat
HGF ELISA kits (Institute of Immunology, Tokyo,
Japan) and Wako CPK test kits (Wako Pure Chemicals
Industries, Osaka, Japan), respectively.
Histological analysis and terminal deoxynucleotidyl trans￾ferase–mediated dUTP nick end-labeling assay. The LV from
each heart was excised, sliced transversely 4 mm basal
from the apex, fixed in 10% formalin in PBS, and embed￾ded in paraffin. Evaluation of the infarct area was done,
as described (32) but with some modifications. In brief,
transverse sections were labeled with monoclonal α-sar￾comeric actin (clone 5C5, Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis,
Missouri, USA) followed by visualization using a kit for
alkaline phosphatase (DAKO Corp., Carpinteria, Cali￾fornia, USA). Ratio of the nonviable area (unlabeled with
α-sarcomeric actin antibody) to the area of the whole LV
was analyzed for each section. For double immunohis￾tochemistry of α-sarcomeric actin and c-Met, the slides
were incubated overnight with anti–α-sarcomeric actin
antibody and polyclonal anti-mouse c-Met (SP 260;
Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, California,
USA), respectively. The slides were then sequentially
incubated with rhodamin-conjugated anti-mouse IgG
(ICN Pharmaceuticals Inc., Aurora, Ohio, USA) and
FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (ICN Pharmaceuticals
Inc.), respectively. As a control staining, c-Met antibody
was absorbed prior to staining with an excess amount of
the specific peptide. For immunohistochemical detec￾tion of Bcl-xL, the slides were incubated with polyclonal
anti-mouse Bcl-xL (S-18; Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.)
for 1 hour, followed by sequential incubation with
biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Vector Laboratories,
Burlingame, California, USA) and peroxidase-labeled
avidin-biotin complex, using a kit (VECTASTAIN Elite
ABC; Vector Laboratories). Terminal deoxynucleotidyl
transferase–mediated dUTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL)
staining was done using an In Situ Apoptosis Detection
Kit (MK-500; Takara Shuzo Co., Tokyo, Japan). The
number of TUNEL- or Bcl-xL–positive cardiomyocytes
was counted at a 400-fold field magnification, using at
least ten randomly selected fields per section.
Cell culture and survival assay. Primary cultures of
neonatal rat cardiomyocytes were prepared using
methods originally described by Simpson et al. (33),
but with minor modification. Purity of the isolated car￾diomyocytes exceeded 90% at the time of each experi￾ment, as determined by α-sarcomeric actin immunola￾beling. In survival assays, cells were seeded on 96-well
culture dishes at a cell density of 2 × 104/cm2. After 2
days of culture in DMEM containing 10% FBS, cells
were cultured in serum-free medium for 24 hours. HGF
or vehicle alone was added 1 hour prior to H2O2 treat￾ment, and 50 µM H2O2 was added for 1 hour followed
by 6 hours of culture. The viability of the cells was
assessed, using WST-1 assay kits (Dojindo Co., Tokyo,
Japan), an advanced MTT assay. Since the MTT/WST￾1 assay is based on formazan reaction only by metabol￾ic active cells, it detects both apoptotic and necrotic cell
death. The survival of cells, in percent, was defined as
1512 The Journal of Clinical Investigation | December 2000 | Volume 106 | Number 12

(absorbance in each well) / (absorbance in a control
well) × 100 (%). To test the effect of rat plasma on car￾dioprotection, cardiomyocytes were cultured for 2
hours in the presence or absence of 10% plasma from
normal rats or rats with myocardial infarction. Imme￾diately before use, the plasma was preincubated for 2
hours with normal rabbit IgG or anti–rat HGF IgG.
The cells were then treated with 50 µM H2O2 for 1 hour
and further cultured for 6 hours.
ERK-1/2 activity and Western blots. After serum starva￾tion for 60 hours, cardiomyocytes were treated with 10
ng/ml HGF for 10 minutes and lysed with SDS sample
buffer. Cell lysate was subjected to SDS-PAGE on a
12% polyacrylamide gel, and proteins were elec￾troblotted on PVDF membrane (Bio-Rad Laboratories
Inc., Hercules, California, USA). After blocking, the
membrane was sequentially incubated with anti–phos￾pho-p44/p42 mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK￾1/2) antibody (E10; New England BioLabs Inc., Bever￾ly, Massachusetts, USA), biotinylated anti-mouse IgG
(Vector Laboratories), horseradish peroxidase–conju￾gated streptavidin (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech UK,
Little Chalfont, United Kingdom), and an enhanced
chemiluminescence reagent (Amersham Pharmacia
Biotech UK). To detect total ERK protein, the cell
lysate was subjected to Western blot, as above except
for use of an anti–ERK-1 antibody (K-23; Santa Cruz
Biotechnology Inc.). To detect c-Met protein, car￾diomyocytes were transferred to serum-free DMEM
with or without 50 µM H2O2 and cultured for 24
hours. Cells were lysed in SDS sample buffer, the cell
lysate was subjected to SDS-PAGE on a 7.5% polyacry￾lamide gel, and proteins were electroblotted on PVDF
membrane. The membrane was subjected to overnight
blocking and sequentially immunoblotted, using an
anti-mouse c-Met polyclonal antibody. To examine
specificity of the antibody to HGF, plasma obtained
from rats with ischemia/reperfusion injury was
immunoprecipitated with anti-HGF antibody or nor￾mal rabbit IgG for 2 hours, and the immunoprecipi￾tate absorbed to protein A-Sepharose was subjected to
SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions.
Immunoblotting was done, using biotinylated anti–rat

HGF antibody as a primary antibody. To detect Bcl-xL
protein, the cell lysate or tissue extract was subjected
to SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotting was done with
polyclonal anti-mouse Bcl-xL, as described above.
Statistical analysis. We used Student’s unpaired t test or
ANOVA to determine the statistical significance. Survival
rates were compared by Kaplan-Meier method followed
by log-rank test. P < 0.05 was considered significant.
Results
Changes in pathophysiology and expression of HGF/c-Met
in a rat model of ischemia/reperfusion injury. Six hours
after transient occlusion-reperfusion of the left coro￾nary artery, myocardial destruction with focal infil￾tration of lymphocytes and polymorphonuclear
leukocytes was evident in the left ventricular free wall
(LVFW) (Figure 1, a and b). Infiltration of inflamma￾tory cells was more diffuse 12 and 24 hours after
ischemia/reperfusion (Figure 1c). The infarct lesion
in the area was wide 48 hours after reperfusion (Fig￾ure 1d). Serum CPK activity was 11-fold higher in
infarcted rats than the normal level 3 hours after
reperfusion, and it decreased to a threefold higher
level at 12 hours (Figure 1e). Therefore, myocardial
destruction rapidly progressed after ischemia/reper￾fusion, and pathological features of the infarct area
became apparent by 48 hours after reperfusion.
Plasma HGF levels increased and reached the first
peak 3 hours after reperfusion, the level being 6.2-fold
higher than that of normal rat plasma (Figure 1f). The
level thereafter decreased and reached the second peak
at 24 hours, the level being 12.4-fold higher than that
of normal (Figure 1f). HGF concentrations in ischemic
myocardial tissue 24 hours after reperfusion were also
5.5-fold higher than those of normal rats — 72.2 ± 10.8
ng/g tissue in ischemic myocardium and 13.6 ± 2.1
ng/g tissue in normal myocardium, respectively. The c￾Met/HGF receptor mRNA level in the myocardium was
low immediately after ischemia/reperfusion and in
sham-operated rats, whereas c-Met mRNA levels
markedly increased in the ischemic myocardium of the
LVFW, a region affected by ischemic injury, and
reached a peak 12 hours after ischemia/reperfusion
(Figure 1g). In contrast, upregulation of c-Met mRNA
was weak in the myocardium of the interventricular
septum (IVS), a nonischemic region. Double immunos￾taining with c-Met and α-sarcomeric actin, a car￾diomyocyte-related protein, in infarcted heart tissues
also indicated that cardiomyocytes were c-Met–positive
in the LVFW adjacent to the infarcted area (Figure 1, h
and i), whereas it was relatively weak in the IVS (Figure
1, j and k) and sham-operated heart (Figure 1, part l).
Green signals in cardiomyocytes in the border region
(Figure 1m) were mostly diminished in control stain￾ing with preabsorbed antibody by antigenic peptide
(compare Figure 1m and inset).
Cardioprotection by HGF in vitro. To determine whether
HGF directly exhibits protective actions on cardiomy￾ocytes, we used neonatal rat cardiomyocytes in pri￾mary culture. c-Met protein was detectable in car￾diomyocytes under normal culture condition, and the
c-Met level slightly increased under serum-starved con￾1514 The Journal of Clinical Investigation | December 2000 | Volume 106 | Number 12

cardiomyocytes by HGF, as determined by
immunoblotting with anti–phospho-ERK-1/2
antibody (top). Immunoblotting with

amount of ERK-1/2 protein is similar in two
lanes (bottom). (d) Quantification of ERK-1/2

ditions (Figure 2a). We then asked whether HGF
would promote the survival of cultured cardiomy￾ocytes. Cardiomyocytes were exposed to H2O2 to
induce oxidative stress in the presence or absence of
HGF. Six hours after this treatment, the number of
viable cells decreased to 67.9% of the control. Howev￾er, HGF dose-dependently increased the number of
viable cells, the maximal effect being seen with 30
ng/ml HGF: 95.2% of cells survived in the presence of
30 ng/ml HGF (Figure 2b).
Since activation of ERK is closely associated with
cytoprotection in cardiomyocytes (34, 35), we analyzed
ERK-1/2 activation in cultured cardiomyocytes. Under
serum-starved conditions, ERK-1/2 was weakly phos￾phorylated, whereas addition of HGF significantly
increased phosphorylated ERK-1/2 (Figure 2, c and d).
HGF dose-dependently activated ERK-1/2,
and the maximal effect was seen with 10–30
ng/ml HGF (data not shown), similar to the
effect on cell survival.
Neutralization of endogenous HGF in
ischemia/reperfusion injury. To determine the
significance of enhanced expression of HGF
and c-Met, we used neutralizing anti–rat
HGF IgG (30, 31). When plasma from a rat
with ischemia/reperfusion injury was
immunoprecipitated and subjected to West￾ern blots using the anti–rat HGF IgG, a sin￾gle band corresponding to HGF was specif￾ically detected (Figure 3a), indicating that
this antibody is highly specific to HGF. Five
hundred micrograms of the IgG was given 20 minutes
prior to coronary occlusion and every 12 hours after
reperfusion. More than 80% of plasma HGF was com￾plexed with this antibody under this experimental
condition (data not shown). The infarct area was
immunohistochemically determined to be α-sarcom￾eric actin–negative (Figure 3b). Infarct area in the
group treated with the antibody was significantly larg￾er than that of the control group given normal IgG
(Figure 3b). Consistently, HGF neutralization also sig￾nificantly increased CPK activity in serum from 1410.6
± 265.5 to 2023.1 ± 104.1 IU/l 48 hours after operation
(P = 0.0453). TUNEL assay revealed that apoptosis of
cardiomyocytes in the LVFW was much higher in the
group treated with anti-HGF antibody than in the
control group (Figure 3c). Importantly, 50% of the rats

hours after reperfusion. Forty-eight

killed and histological and bio￾chemical analyses were made.

the presence of plasma from a normal
rat (Normal plasma) or plasma from a
rat with ischemia/reperfusion injury (I/R
plasma). Plasma was nontreated or
treated with anti–rat HGF antibody for

the absence or presence of the plasma
for 2 hours. Cells were treated with
H2O2 for 1 hour and further cultured for
6 hours. AP < 0.01 vs. normal plasma; BP
< 0.05 vs. I/R plasma.

injected with anti-HGF IgG died of heart failure with￾in 48 hours after reperfusion, whereas all animals in
the control group survived during the period (Figure
3d). At autopsy, we observed two hearts of animals
that died at 12 hours and 18 hours after
ischemia/reperfusion; both showed massive myocar￾dial apoptosis, whereas infarction was not obvious at
that time (data not shown). Thus apoptosis progress￾es more rapidly than does necrosis, and this may relate
to cardiac dysfunction and death.
We next determined whether plasma from an infarct￾ed rat would promote survival of cardiomyocytes after
H2O2 treatment in vitro. When myocytes from neona￾tal rats were cultured in the presence of plasma
obtained from a normal rat, cell survival decreased to
46.1% after H2O2 treatment. On the other hand, the
presence of plasma from an infarcted rat promoted sur￾vival of the cells to a level similar to that in the control;
hence, plasma from an infarcted rat contained endoge￾nous cardioprotective factors. Anti-HGF antibody
inhibited the cardioprotective activity in the plasma
from an infarcted rat, and 50% of the activity in the
plasma that promoted cell survival was abolished by
the anti-HGF antibody. This antibody did not affect
survival of the cells exposed to normal plasma (Figure
4). It would thus appear that endogenous HGF is sig￾nificantly responsible for the cardioprotective effect in
the plasma from rats with ischemia/reperfusion injury.
Cardioprotection from myocardial infarction by exogenous
HGF. We next addressed the therapeutic potential of
HGF in ischemia/reperfusion injury. For administration
of HGF, 160 µg of recombinant human HGF was given
intravenously immediately after reperfusion, and at
every 12 hours after reperfusion. In the control group,
only the vehicle (saline with 0.1% BSA) was given at the
indicated time. Forty-eight hours after reperfusion, the
infarct area had extended to 16.0% of the whole LV in
rats not given HGF. In contrast, HGF treatment signifi￾cantly decreased the infarct area to 5.7% (Figure 5, a and
b). Likewise, HGF administration reduced CPK leakage
in serum (Figure 5c). Cardiac function, as evaluated by
left ventricular end-diastolic pressure LVEDP and max￾imal rate of left ventricular pressure rise (maximal
dP/dt), was improved by HGF administration to a sta￾tistically significant level compared with findings in con￾trol saline-treated rats. HGF also improved left ventric￾ular systolic pressure, albeit not statistically (Figure 5d).
In TUNEL staining, the number of TUNEL-positive
myocytes was significantly decreased by HGF-treatment
(Figure 6a). Bcl-xL was specifically detected in myocytes
in the ischemic area as early as 3 hours after the treat￾ment (Figure 6b), but not in the nonischemic area (data
not shown). Of note, Bcl-xL expression in cardiomy￾ocytes was increased by HGF administration (Figure 6b).
Consistently, Western blot analysis of Bcl-xL levels in
myocardial tissue extracts indicated that Bcl-xL expres￾sion was slightly increased by ischemia/reperfusion
injury and that HGF treatment significantly increased it
to a much higher level than in control myocardial tissue
(Figure 6c). Bcl-2 was undetectable under these experi￾mental conditions (data not shown). Similar to these
changes, Bcl-xL expression was undetectable in car￾diomyocytes cultured under normal conditions but was
detectable 12 hours after serum-starvation. On the other
hand, Bcl-xL expression was rapidly induced upon HGF￾treatment 1 hour after serum-starvation and further
increased to a much higher level than that in control cul￾tures (Figure 6d). Therefore, the cardioprotective action
of HGF is due, in part, to a direct antiapoptotic effect on
cardiomyocytes.
Discussion
Our data support the notion that HGF has a definite role
in cardioprotection from ischemia/reperfusion injury as
an endogenous cardiotrophic factor, and that this car￾dioprotection is exerted through the direct action of

HGF on cardiomyocytes. Evidence for this proposal
includes: (a) the neutralization of HGF in vivo resulted in
exacerbated pathology and increased mortality due to
cardiac failure; (b) HGF directly exhibited protective
effects on cardiomyocytes in vitro, and the cardioprotec￾tive activity in the plasma from rats with induced
ischemia/reperfusion injury was significantly suppressed
by the neutralization of HGF; (c) both c-Met/HGF recep￾tor expression in cardiomyocytes and plasma HGF levels
rapidly increased in response to ischemia/reperfusion
injury; and (d) administration of HGF to rats with
ischemia/reperfusion injury resulted in a much lesser
degree of myocardial apoptosis and infarct area, and bet￾ter cardiac function, compared with control rats.
It is noteworthy that serum HGF levels in patients
with myocardial infarction were over 50 times higher
than those in healthy humans, but the biological sig￾nificance of this remains to be addressed (26). Our
results suggest that the increased blood HGF may
reflect defensive reactions and participate in cardio￾protection against myocardial infarction, possibly also
in humans. Although the source of plasma HGF that
increased following ischemia/reperfusion injury
remains to be defined, rapid induction of HGF mRNA
expression was seen in distant intact organs such as the
liver, kidney, lung, and spleen, as well as in the injured
heart after ischemia/reperfusion injury in rats (ref. 36,
and our unpublished data), suggesting that endoge￾nous HGF might be derived from these organs. A sim￾ilar rapid induction of HGF expression in injured and
distant intact organs was noted in the case of acute
hepatic and renal injuries (37, 38), and the presence of
a humoral factor that induces HGF expression was
noted in plasma of rats with hepatic and renal injuries
(39). In addition to an increase in HGF levels in plasma,
there was also rapid upregulation of c-Met receptor
after ischemia/reperfusion injury. Since biological
effects of HGF on cardiomyocytes, as revealed by serum
CPK, Bcl-xL expression, and myocardial apoptosis, were
seen as early as 3 hours after reperfusion, c-Met recep￾tor expressed in normal cardiomyocytes at a relatively
low level might be responsible for early signaling to
protect the myocardium. Subsequent increase in c-Met
mRNA may possibly relate to the autoinduction of
gene expression triggered by HGF (38, 40).
Myocardial apoptosis occurs after ischemia/reperfu￾sion injury (2–4), and prevention of it has gained much
attention as a new target for cardioprotection from
ischemia/reperfusion injury (41, 42). We found that
biochemical neutralization of HGF resulted in
increased apoptosis, while HGF administration result￾ed in a much-decreased apoptosis in cardiomyocytes,
and HGF was cytoprotective for cultured cardiomy￾ocytes. Therefore, the cardioprotective effects of HGF
may be mainly attributable to its antiapoptotic action
on cardiomyocytes. With respect to mechanisms that
relate to the antiapoptotic effects of HGF, we focused
on Bcl-xL expression in cardiomyocytes, since Bcl-xL
has a critical role in antiapoptosis, counteracting
apoptotic signals in a variety of cells, including car￾The Journal of Clinical Investigation | December 2000 | Volume 106 | Number 12 1517

diomyocytes (43). In addition, previous studies showed
that prevention of massive hepatocyte apoptosis and
fulminant hepatic failure by HGF were associated with
a remarkable induction of Bcl-xL (23, 24). Therefore,
the rapid induction of Bcl-xL expression in cardiomy￾ocytes may be involved in the antiapoptosis achieved
by HGF. On the other hand, although we focused here
on the antiapoptotic action of HGF, necrotic cell death
after myocardial infarction has to be considered.
Recent studies revealed that intracellular signaling
pathways leading to antiapoptotic and antinecrotic
cell death are at least partially shared (44). Overex￾pression of Bcl-2 in hepatocytes suppressed necrotic
cell death (45). Moreover, activation of ERK-1/2 par￾ticipates in the reduction of necrotic cell death, as well
as apoptotic cell death (46). Therefore, rapid induction
of Bcl-xL and activation of ERK by HGF in cardiomy￾ocytes make way for the notion that HGF may give a
signal to reduce necrosis in cardiomyocytes following
myocardial infarction.
Other researchers reported that protective effects of
cardiotrophic factors such as IGF-1 and leukemia
inhibitory factor involve ERK activation (47, 48). Inhi￾bition of ERK phosphorylation by a specific inhibitor
resulted in increased apoptosis in cardiomyocytes (49)
and ischemia/reperfusion injury in isolated rat hearts
(34). In addition to the ERK-related pathway, stimula￾tion of Akt downstream of phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-
kinase is involved in protection of cardiomyocytes by
IGF-1 (50). However, HGF did not induce Akt phos￾phorylation; thus the PI 3-kinase–Akt pathway does not
seem to be involved in HGF-dependent antiapoptosis in
cardiomyocytes (our unpublished data). Therefore, the
intracellular signaling pathways leading to antiapopto￾sis in cardiomyocytes by HGF and to that by IGF-1 dif￾fer, at least in part, although HGF and IGF-1 exhibit
similar cardioprotective actions, some of which are
mediated by receptor tyrosine kinases. In this context,
it is noteworthy that Bag-1, a partner of Bcl-2/Bcl-xL, is
specifically associated with the c-Met receptor. Associa￾tion of Bag-1 with Bcl-2/Bcl-xL enhances antiapoptotic
action of Bcl-2/Bcl-xL, and expression of Bag-1 in cells
promotes the cell survival activity of HGF (51).
Although the cardioprotective and antiapoptotic
effects of HGF on cardiomyocytes are likely to be large￾ly attributable to direct actions on cardiomyocytes, pre￾vious studies revealed a potent angiogenic action of
HGF in vivo (52, 53). Likewise, transfection of HGF
gene into the rat myocardium resulted in a significant
increase in the number of blood vessels (54). Together
with findings that administration or gene transfection
of angiogenic growth factors into laboratory animals
promoted coronary angiogenesis and resulted in a
diminished pathology due to myocardial infarction
(55, 56), biological actions of HGF for both myocardi￾um and coronary vessels may further minimize the
extensive myocardial injury due to prolonged ischemia.
In summary, endogenous and exogenous HGF pro￾tected the rat heart against ischemia/reperfusion injury.
Preclinical and clinical trials of HGF for treatment of
patients with myocardial infarction can be considered.
