Sedentary living and the consumption of calorie-dense food has pre￾cipitated a steep rise in obesity throughout the developed world. This 
is particularly alarming because of the vast array of obesity-associated 
diseases, including type 2 diabetes, heart disease, insulin resistance, 
hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, hypertension and many types of can￾cer1,2. The end results are an expanding population of chronically 
ill people, staggering health care expenses and a prediction that, for 
the first time, the current generation will have a shorter life span 
than previous generations3–5. There is thus an urgent need for new 
weight-loss treatments.
Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is a key site of heat production (ther￾mogenesis) in mammals that has for many decades been considered 
an attractive target to promote weight loss. The heat produced by 
BAT is essential for the survival of small mammals in cold environ￾ments and for arousal in hibernators. Brown adipocytes in BAT are 
packed with mitochondria that contain uncoupling protein-1 (UCP1). 
UCP1, when activated, short circuits the electrochemical gradient that 
drives ATP synthesis and thereby stimulates respiratory chain activity. 
Heat is generated from the combustion of available substrates6 and is 
distributed to the rest of the body through the circulation.
Clusters of UCP1-expressing adipocytes with thermogenic capac￾ity also develop in white adipose tissue (WAT) in response to vari￾ous stimuli7. These adipocytes have been named beige, ‘brite’ (brown 
in white), iBAT (induced BAT), recruitable BAT and wBAT (white 
adipose BAT). Similar to adipocytes in BAT, beige cells in mouse 
WAT are defined by their multilocular lipid droplet morphology, 
high mitochondrial content and the expression of a core set of brown 
fat–specific genes (for example, Ucp1, Cidea and Pgc1a (encoding per￾oxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator 1-α)). Despite 
a common ability to undergo thermogenesis, brown and beige cells 
have many distinguishing characteristics and should be considered 
as distinct cell types (Fig. 1). First, beige cells, at least those in the 
mouse subcutaneous depot, do not derive from the same embryonic 
(Myf5 (encoding myogenic factor 5)-expressing) precursors that give 
rise to brown adipocytes8. Second, a number of quantitative trait loci 
are associated with the induced development of beige but not brown 
adipocytes9, suggesting that these cell types are differentially regu￾lated. Third, brown and beige adipocytes express distinct and distin￾guishing gene signatures10,11. Fourth, a striking difference between 
the two cell types is that brown adipocytes express high levels of Ucp1
and other thermogenic genes under basal (unstimulated) conditions, 
whereas beige adipocytes express these genes only in response to acti￾vators such as agonists of the β-adrenergic receptor or peroxisome 
proliferator-activated receptor-γ (Ppar-γ)12,13. Importantly, this trait 
is fat-cell autonomous, as brown fat cells increase their expression of 
thermogenic genes (for example, Ucp1) during adipogenesis in culture 
from preadipocytes without the addition of classical activators14.
A clear question is whether brown and beige fat cells have different 
functions. The answer to this question is still unknown and has not 
been well studied. However, a recent study has suggested that fully 
stimulated brown and beige adipocytes contain comparable amounts 
of Ucp1, suggesting that they have similar thermogenic capacities10. 
On the basis of these findings, the name beige for these cells might be 
misleading and is more applicable for describing the tissue that has 
undergone browning rather than the Ucp1+ adipocytes themselves. 
Aside from thermogenesis, it is highly probable that beige and brown 
adipocytes have other cell type–specific actions that have yet to be 
studied. For example, beige adipocytes may secrete certain factors that 
affect WAT function, systemic metabolism or both.
The biomedical interest in brown and beige adipocytes has centered 
on the capacity of these cell types to counteract metabolic disease, 
including obesity and type 2 diabetes. Indeed, increased activities of

Brown and beige fat: development, function 
and therapeutic potential
Matthew Harms & Patrick Seale
Adipose tissue, best known for its role in fat storage, can also suppress weight gain and metabolic disease through 
the action of specialized, heat-producing adipocytes. Brown adipocytes are located in dedicated depots and express 
constitutively high levels of thermogenic genes, whereas inducible ‘brown-like’ adipocytes, also known as beige cells, 
develop in white fat in response to various activators. The activities of brown and beige fat cells reduce metabolic 
disease, including obesity, in mice and correlate with leanness in humans. Many genes and pathways that regulate 
brown and beige adipocyte biology have now been identified, providing a variety of promising therapeutic targets 
for metabolic disease.

brown and beige adipocytes have been linked to obesity resistance in 
many mouse models15–17 (Table 1). In humans, it was assumed for 
many years that there was too little brown fat present in adults to affect 
body weight. However, a few years ago, imaging studies revealed the 
presence of substantial deposits of UCP1-expressing adipocytes in 
adult humans, the mass, activity or both of which were lower in obese 
and older subjects18–22. The key question now is whether reduced 
thermogenic activity in fat cells is a cause or a consequence of weight 
gain in humans. Regardless of its natural role, increasing the activity 
of brown fat, beige fat or both through drugs or other methods holds 
tremendous promise for the treatment of metabolic disease.
Mitochondrial uncoupling has been tried as a weight-loss therapy. 
The chemical uncoupler 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP) allows protons to leak 
across the mitochondrial membrane, mimicking the effect of activated 
UCP1 (ref. 23). In the 1930s, DNP was used widely as an effective diet 
pill to treat obesity, providing proof-of-concept support for mitochon￾drial uncoupling as an approach for weight loss. However, at high doses 
(which vary in different people), unregulated respiratory uncoupling in 
all cells causes dangerous side effects, including hyperthermia and death. 
Thus, the goal should be to develop strategies that enhance respiratory 
uncoupling selectively in adipose tissue by exploiting the mechanisms 
that naturally evolved to do this in brown and beige fat cells.

Figure 1 Differences between brown and beige adipocytes. Brown adipocytes express high levels of Ucp1 under basal conditions, whereas clusters 
of beige adipocytes can only be easily recognized in WAT after cold or β-adrenergic stimulation. Enriched markers of brown as compared to beige 
adipocytes have recently been identified, including the brown markers Zic1 (ref. 12), Lhx8 (refs. 12,37), Eva1 (ref. 10) and Epsti1 (ref. 11) and the 
beige markers Cd137 (ref. 10), Tmem26 (ref. 10), Tbx1 (refs. 10,12), Cited1 (ref. 11) and Shox2 (ref. 25). Among the activators that have been 
studied in both compartments, irisin is the only one that has selective actions in beige but not brown adipocytes.

Development of brown and beige adipocytes
Brown adipocytes. BAT forms during embryonic development before 
other fat depots and is assumed to contain a uniform population of 
adipocytes. The major BAT depots in rodents are in the interscapular 
region (interscapular, axillary and cervical pads) embedded in and 
around deep back muscles. An interscapular BAT depot has also been 
noted in human infants, which regresses and is absent in adults24,25. 
Most brown fat cells originate from precursor cells in the embryonic 
mesoderm that also give rise to skeletal muscle cells and a subpopula￾tion of white adipocytes8,26,27. These precursors transiently express 
Myf5 and Pax7, two genes that were previously thought to selectively 
mark skeletal myogenic cells in the mesoderm8,27 (Fig. 2a). Consistent 
with a developmental relationship between brown fat and muscle, 
brown fat precursor cells express a muscle-like gene signature28, 
and brown fat and muscle have related mitochondrial proteomes29. 
However, whether Myf5-expressing cells are multipotent or whether 
there are separate pools of Myf5-expressing precursors that contribute 
to muscle, brown fat and white fat remains to be tested.
Beige adipocytes. The embryonic origin and cell hierarchy of beige 
adipocytes is less clear. Beige and brown adipocytes probably come 
from distinct cell lineages, given that beige cells, at least in the subcu￾taneous depot, do not have a history of Myf5 expression8,26. In formed 
WAT, an important question is whether beige adipocytes come from 
white adipocytes through transdifferentiation or arise through the 
de novo differentiation and maturation of precursors. Over a decade 
ago, Himms-Hagen et al.30 found that most beige adipocytes arise from 
pre-existing (nondividing) cells that they presumed were mature adi￾pocytes. Since then, Cinti and others have provided substantial evidence 
in support of the idea that large unilocular white adipocytes transform 
into beige adipocytes in response to cold or β3-adrenergic agonists7.
A new study from Wang et al.31 used a pulse-chase fate-mapping 
technique in mice to revisit this issue. The authors pulse labeled mature 
adipocytes in WAT using LacZ . This labeling was indelible and heritable 
such that LacZ was constitutively expressed in the pulsed adipocytes 
and any of their descendents. After being pulsed, the mice were 
exposed to cold or treated with β3-adrenergic agonists to induce the 
formation of beige adipocytes. The results were clear—the majority of 
newly acquired Ucp1+ adipocytes in the subcutaneous inguinal depot 
were not marked by LacZ. This indicates that most, if not all, beige 
adipocytes (at least in this subcutaneous depot) arise from a precursor 
population rather than from pre-existing adipocytes (Fig. 2b).
The thermogenic profile of beige adipocytes is reversible. Beige 
adipocytes acquired in WAT during cold exposure lose Ucp1 expres￾sion and are retained after mice are moved back to warmer condi￾tions32 (Fig. 2b). When these mice are re-exposed to cold, the same 
cells again induce Ucp1 expression32. Interestingly, the cells marked 
by previous Ucp1 expression were not the only source of beige adi￾pocytes during the second round of cold exposure. This suggests that 
beige adipocytes are retained and may function similarly to white fat 
cells for a certain period of time in animals that were previously cold. 
These beige adipocytes are presumably depleted through the normal 
mechanisms that control tissue turnover.
Another important question is whether beige and white adipocytes 
arise from different types of precursors. Petrovic et al.12 found that 
a subset of adipocytes differentiated in vitro from the stromal vas￾cular fraction (an enriched source of preadipocytes) of WAT induce 
Ucp1 expression in response to treatment with PPAR-γ activators; 
this suggests that some but not all preadipose cells are thermogeni￾cally competent. Recently, the Spiegelman laboratory used limited 
dilutions to clone preadipocyte cell lines from the stromal vascular 
fraction of subcutaneous (inguinal) WAT10. Through global gene pro￾filing and differentiation analyses, the authors identified two types of 
preadipocytes—white and beige. Both types of committed precursors 
differentiated into lipid-laden adipocytes that lacked thermogenic 
characteristics under standard adipogenic conditions. However, 
only beige cells induced a thermogenic gene program when treated 
with β-adrenergic agonists. Notably, Cd137 and transmembrane 
Figure 2 Transcriptional regulation of 
brown and beige adipocyte development. 
(a) Brown adipocytes are derived from a 
Myf5-expressing progenitor population. 
Ebf2 cooperates with Ppar-γ to promote the 
expression of Prdm16, which drives a brown￾fat cell fate. Thermogenesis in mature brown 
adipocytes is activated by norepinephrine (NE), 
a β3 agonist, released from sympathetic 
neurons. NE signals through β-adrenoreceptors 
to increase the expression and activity of 
Pgc-1α, a transcriptional coactivator that 
coordinates gene programming in response 
to activation. (b) In inguinal fat, β-adrenergic 
stimulation triggers predominantly de novo
differentiation of precursor cells (large arrow). 
We leave open the possibility that under 
some conditions, mature white fat cells can 
transdifferentiate into beige cells (small dashed 
arrow). In epididymal WAT, caloric excess causes 
bipotent progenitors to differentiate into white 
adipocytes, whereas β-adrenergic activators 
stimulate beige adipocyte development. TZD 
agonists of Ppar-γ promote beiging both by 
increasing the stability of Prdm16 and through 
the Sirt1-dependent deacetylation of Ppar-γ, 
which recruits Prdm16 to Ppar-γ target genes. 
β-adrenergic signaling drives the expression and activity of Pgc-1α in beige adipocytes. Pgc-1α is targeted by numerous repressors to block beige 
adipocyte development. Ac, acetylation.

protein 26 (Tmem26) were identified as cell-surface markers for native 
beige precursors, thus enabling the direct purification of these cells 
from fat tissues. These data suggest that cold (through β-adrenergic 
agonists) triggers the differentiation of Cd137+Tmem26+ precursor 
cells into Ucp1+ beige adipocytes and that beige cells require con￾stant stimulation to maintain their thermogenic programming. In 
light of these recent studies, there does not seem to be much or any 
direct transformation of white into beige adipocytes, at least under 
physiological conditions.
Beige adipocytes are most abundant in the inguinal WAT, which is 
a major subcutaneous depot in rodents7. However, Ucp1-expressing 
adipocytes are evident in most (if not all) WAT depots in response to 
cold exposure7,30,33. In perigonadal (visceral) fat of male mice, beige 
adipocytes develop from a population of precursors that also differ￾entiates into white adipocytes34 (Fig. 2b). These bipotent precursors 
express platelet-derived growth factor receptor-α (Pdgfr-α) and are 
closely associated with blood vessels. After treatment of mice with 
β3-adrenergic agonists, these precursor cells proliferate, lose Pdgfr-α
expression and differentiate into Ucp1+ adipocytes. Conversely, a 
high-fat diet stimulates the differentiation of Pdgfr-α+ cells into white 
adipocytes34. This result is consistent with the finding that most or all 
white adipocytes descend from Pdgfra-expressing cells35. Importantly, 
cell-culture analyses have shown that single Pdgfr-α+ cells can give 
rise to both Ucp1– and Ucp1+ (beige) adipocytes34.
In the mature adipocyte tracing studies of Wang et al.31, very little 
beige fat recruitment, but a surprising amount of white adipogenesis, 
was detected in the perigonadal WAT of mice exposed to cold for 1–3 d 
or treated with a β3 agonist for 7 d. Why new white fat cells develop 
during cold exposure is unclear. It is also surprising that so few Ucp1+
cells were detected. Perhaps the exposure was too short to elicit a full 
beige recruitment in the newly developed adipocytes? It would be 
interesting to examine the effects of chronic cold in these mice, as this 
is known to lead to the extensive browning of WAT depots.
The prevalence of beige adipocytes within different human WAT 
depots has not been carefully evaluated. However, it is known that 
human WAT contains precursor cells that are capable of expressing 
UCP1 and other brown and/or beige characteristics, particularly in 
response to PPAR-γ activation36. Additionally, it was (and still is) 
unclear whether the deposits of UCP1-expressing adipocytes iden￾tified by fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG￾PET) in adult humans are analogous to beige or brown fat. Wu et al.10
and Sharp et al.11 reported that supraclavicular tissue, the largest 
FDG-PET–positive depot in humans, expresses selective markers of 
beige fat cells. By contrast, Jesperson et al.37 found that tissue and 
in vitro–differentiated adipocytes from this depot express both brown￾and beige-specific markers. A different depot in the neck region 
was shown to have the molecular characteristics of mouse brown 
fat38. Typing these depots as brown or beige on the basis of their 
expression levels of a few mouse marker genes that have no known 
function(s) has not been conclusive thus far. Functional marker genes 
or assays are needed to better categorize the different human and 
mouse fat depots and cell types, and researchers should continue to 
study the biology and therapeutic potential of both classic BAT and 
inducible beige fat.
Regulation of brown and beige adipocytes by PRDM16
Prdm16 is a large zinc finger–containing transcriptional factor that is 
highly expressed in mouse BAT relative to visceral WAT39. PRDM16
expression is also substantially enriched in human BAT relative to 
adjacent subcutaneous WAT22,40. Ectopic Prdm16 expression converts 
myoblasts and white fat precursors into thermogenic, Ucp1-containing 
adipocytes8. Mechanistic studies have suggested that Prdm16 acts 
primarily through binding to and modulating the activity of other 
transcriptional factors, including c/EBPβ, Ppar-γ, Ppar-α and 
Pgc-1α8,39,41,42. Knockdown of Prdm16 ablates the thermogenic 
characteristics of brown fat cells while also causing an increase in 
the expression of white fat–specific and muscle-specific genes8,39. 
Together these studies have strongly suggested that PRDM16 is a key 
driver of brown fat cell fate.
The importance of Prdm16 in brown fat cell differentiation 
prompted us to examine whether Prdm16 also has a role in the 
development of beige adipocytes. After analyzing various mouse 
WAT depots, we noted that Prdm16 is highly expressed in the depots 
that are most prone to beiging, especially the inguinal WAT16. 
Importantly, reduction of Prdm16 expression blocks the induction 
of a thermogenic program in cultured subcutaneous adipocytes and 
decreases the recruitment of beige adipocytes in WAT in response to 
β-adrenergic or Ppar-γ agonists16,43. Conversely, transgenic expres￾sion of Prdm16 in adipose tissues of mice stimulates beige adipocyte 
development to counteract high fat diet–induced weight gain and 
improve glucose tolerance16.
Several factors have been shown to regulate brown and beige adi￾pocyte differentiation by modulating Prdm16 expression or activ￾ity. Notable among these factors is bone morphogenetic protein 7 
(Bmp7), a signal that is essential for brown fat development, which 
increases the amounts of Prdm16 mRNA in brown and white fat pre￾cursor cells44–46. Additionally, thiazolidinediones (TZDs), which ago￾nize Ppar-γ, induce thermogenic gene expression in fat cells through 
effects on Prdm16 (refs. 43,47). Interestingly, the muscle-enriched 
microRNA miR-133 directly targets and reduces the amounts of 
Prdm16 to block both brown and beige adipose development46–48. 
Cold exposure suppresses miR-133 expression in fat cells, which 
leads to increased amounts of Prdm16 and increased expression of 
downstream thermogenic target genes48. Compared with wild-type 
mice, mice lacking miR-133 express higher levels of Prdm16 in WAT 
and develop more beige adipocytes49. Intriguingly, miR-133 is also 
highly expressed in mouse adult muscle stem cells, where it suppresses 
Prdm16 expression50. Reduction of miR-133 in regenerating muscle 
causes the ectopic development of brown adipocytes and an associated

Roles of brown and beige fat in regulating metabolism
BAT has long been viewed as a tissue that is key for maintaining body 
temperature in response to cold. In 1979, Rothwell and Stock first 
reported that BAT was also activated in rodents when they overeat 
as a mechanism to preserve energy balance and limit weight gain—
so-called diet-induced thermogenesis51. Consistent with this mecha￾nism, mice genetically engineered to have less BAT gain more weight 
than control mice52. However, for many years it was unclear why 
Ucp1-deficient mice, which are cold intolerant (and thus have defec￾tive BAT), resisted rather than developed obesity53.
An important study by the Cannon and Nedergaard group revealed 
that Ucp1-deficient mice gain more weight than wild-type controls 
but only when they are housed under thermoneutral (28–30 °C) 
conditions54. At room temperature (20–22 °C), mice are cold and 
must therefore expend extra energy to defend their body tempera￾ture. Ucp1-deficient mice, which cannot use BAT, activate alternative 
thermogenic mechanisms55,56. This is thought to conceal the effect 
of brown fat and Ucp1 on energy balance. Consistent with this idea, 
old Ucp1-deficient mice, which are larger and less cold sensitive than

younger mice, become obese even at ambient temperature57. The 
marked impact of temperature on physiology has been overlooked 
by much of the rodent research community. In the area of metabo￾lism, cold stress and its effects have undoubtedly confounded many 
studies. Because people tend to live at thermoneutrality with the aid 
of clothing and heating, a compelling argument could be made that 
most or even all metabolic studies in mice should be conducted under 
thermoneutral conditions.
The obesogenic effect of Ucp1 deficiency in warm mice indicates 
that the activity of brown fat, beige fat or both can affect energy 
balance, but the magnitude (and importance) of this effect in free￾living mice or humans is uncertain. Notably, previous studies in rats 
housed at thermoneutrality failed to find any substantial contribu￾tion of BAT activity to diet-induced thermogenesis58. Moreover, 
Anunciado-Koza et al.55 did not observe changes in adiposity in 
their studies of Ucp1 knockout mice when the mice were housed 
under varying temperature conditions. In addition, increases in BAT 
or Ucp1 activity in response to high-fat feeding are not consistently 
observed59. These divergent findings may provide an opportunity 
to identify modifying factors that affect BAT or Ucp1 activity and 
energy balance. Are there specific dietary components that are 
needed to recruit BAT efficiently? What are the genetic or strain￾specific effects? Do the microbiome or other environmental factors in 
different vivariums play a part?
Regardless of whether BAT has a major physiological role in body 
weight regulation in mice and humans, there is no question that 
expanding the activity of brown fat, beige fat or both in mice through 
genetic manipulation, drugs or transplantation suppresses metabolic 
disease15–17,47,60–63 (Table 1). These results imply that counter￾regulatory mechanisms (for example, increased food intake), which 
might have been predicted to offset the effects of expanded BAT 
activity to preserve energy balance, are not fully effective in mice. 
Notably, in some cases, the beiging of WAT and a highly correlated 
antiobesity effect happen without evidence of increased BAT function. 
For example, the hormone irisin raises energy expenditure through 
selective actions in beige adipocytes60. Similarly, transgenic expres￾sion of Prdm16 in all fat tissues promotes the beiging of WAT and 
resistance to obesity without increasing BAT mass or the amounts 
of Ucp1 mRNA16,17. In addition, transgenic expression of Ucp1 in 
adipocytes suppresses obesity despite leading to a reduction in BAT 
mass17. These results raise an obvious question—do beige adipocytes 
have a more important physiological role than BAT in fighting obes￾ity? This seems unlikely, given that a high-fat diet generally decreases 
the expression of thermogenic genes in WAT coincident with increases 
in WAT mass in mice59.
Mice with increased activity of brown fat, beige fat or both resist 
weight gain but also display improvements in systemic metabolism, 
including improved glucose tolerance and increased insulin sensi￾tivity15,16,60,64. Along these lines, activated brown fat takes up and 
metabolizes large quantities of lipid from the bloodstream65, which 
has beneficial effects on metabolism. In models in which the activ￾ity of beige fat seems to be selectively increased, such as mice with 
transgenic expression of Prdm16 in their fat tissue16 and irisin-treated 
mice60, the improvement in glucose tolerance seems disproportional 
to the modest effects on body weight. We speculate that the increased 
proportion of beige to white adipocytes in WAT modulates systemic 
insulin action through nonthermogenic mechanisms, perhaps by 
altering the secretome of adipose tissue. Additionally, thermogenic 
fat cells, not yet classified as brown or beige, that surround blood ves￾sels (perivascular adipose) have been suggested to protect against the 
development of atherosclerosis66. Thus, the potential therapeutic uses 
of brown and beige fat go beyond obesity and should be considered 
for various metabolic disturbances, including type 2 diabetes, insulin 
resistance, atherosclerosis and lipid disorders.
Sympathetic nerve control of brown and beige fat
Cold is a dominant regulator of many aspects of BAT biology. Mice 
lacking BAT activity are cold intolerant because of defective non￾shivering thermogenesis53. Cold, sensed by various mechanisms, 
including thermoreceptors in the skin, elicits sympathetic outflow 
to BAT through an intricate neural circuitry (reviewed in ref. 67). 
In addition to nerve terminals, alternatively activated macrophages in 
BAT produce catecholamines in response to cold68. Norepinephrine 
agonizes adrenergic receptors on adipocytes, which triggers a signal 
transduction cascade that leads to adaptive increases in the expression 
of thermogenic genes69 (Fig. 3). Prolonged cold exposure also stimu￾lates the proliferation and differentiation of brown precursor cells to 
expand BAT mass and increase thermogenic capacity70. Conversely, 
at warmer housing temperatures or in surgically denervated BAT, the 
expression of Ucp1 and other thermogenic factors are substantially 
reduced in mice71,72.
Sympathetic nerve activity also acutely stimulates heat production 
by activating Ucp1 function. Classic studies have shown that fatty 
acids, rapidly released from lipid droplets in response to nerve activ￾ity, increase proton leak through UCP1 (reviewed in ref. 73). Recently, 
Fedorenko et al.74 discovered that long-chain fatty acids generated 
in the inner mitochondrial membrane by phospholipase A2 (Pla2) 
bind Ucp1 directly and are required for proton transport (Fig. 3). 
An important but often overlooked tenet is that UCP1 does not 
increase the respiratory activity of cells under basal conditions75,76. 
Therefore, therapeutic approaches that expand brown adipocytes, 
beige adipocytes or both without also promoting activation could 
be unproductive. However, in many people, an expanded brown fat 
compartment, beige fat compartment or both may be sufficiently acti￾vated by daily tonic stimuli (for example, food, cold and exercise) to 
achieve therapeutic effects.
Cold is also a classic activator of beige adipocyte development 
and function. Mice housed in the cold undergo a marked remod￾eling of their WAT that is characterized by an accumulation of beige 
adipocytes7. This effect can be mimicked by treating mice with 
β3-adrenergic activators such as CL 316,243 (refs. 7,30,61,62,77–80). 
Interestingly, the propensity of WAT depots to undergo beiging is 
highly correlated with their density of sympathetic nerve fibers81. 
However, other adipose cell- and/or tissue-autonomous factors must 
be involved, as systemic β3-agonist administration (thereby bypassing 
the central nervous system) causes certain depots to beige more than 
others33. Many of the effects of chronic cold on adipose tissues are 
recapitulated in mice that have elevated expression of forkhead box 
protein C2 (Foxc2) in adipocytes15. Specifically, Foxc2 increases BAT 
mass, induces beige fat cell development, drives mitochondrial bio￾genesis and promotes angiogenesis in fat tissue82–84. Foxc2 functions 
in fat cells to a large extent by driving the expression of the R1α regu￾latory subunit of protein kinase A (PKA, encoded by Prkar1a)15,85, 
thus sensitizing adipocytes to the effects of catecholamines. These 
results suggest that the adipocytes instigate most of the tissue remod￾eling that occurs in response to norepinephrine.
The discovery of the mouse β3-adrenergic receptor (β3-AR), which 
is expressed mainly in fat and whose agonism activates thermogenesis 
(reviewed in ref. 72), generated tremendous excitement for thera￾peutic possibilities in humans. However, treatment of humans with 
npg © 2013 Nature America, Inc. All rights reserved.

r e v i e w
1258	 VOLUME 19 | NUMBER 10 | OCTOBER 2013 nature medicine
β3-AR agonists never lived up to the forecasted predictions86. The 
observed difficulties seemed to be due to receptor differences between 
mice and humans, leading to off-target effects in humans, as well 
as poor pharmacokinetic properties and oral bioavailability87. These 
problems, compounded with the previously held tenet that adults have 
very little BAT, caused many companies to abandon their develop￾ment of β3-AR agonists for the treatment of obesity. Future studies 
should consider whether β3-AR agonists could be used in combi￾nation with recruiters of brown fat, beige fat or both. Alternatively, 
it would be worth considering whether prescribed cold exposure 
could be used to activate brown fat, beige fat or both after augmenta￾tion by other pathways.
Cold exposure, which induces thermogenic features in adipose 
cells, also affects the developmental programs of other cell types in 
adipose tissue to coordinate and optimize heat production. For exam￾ple, and as noted above, cold activates alternatively activated mac￾rophages in BAT to produce catecholamines68. Cold also stimulates 
sympathetic nerve branching and recruitment during the browning 
response of WAT81. In addition, cold exposure induces the sprouting 
and growth of blood vessels in adipose to facilitate oxygen delivery 
and heat exchange70,72,88. This angiogenic effect is regulated through 
increased production of vascular endothelial growth factor (Vegf) by 
a mechanism that does not involve hypoxia89–91. Interestingly, Vegf 
secreted by adipose tissue also enhances the recruitment of brown and 
beige adipocytes through an unknown mechanism (Fig. 4). In cul￾tured brown adipocytes, Vegf enhanced cell survival and proliferation, 
whereas VEGF-neutralizing antibodies caused apoptosis92. Notably, 
overexpression of Vegf in adipose tissues of mice increases BAT mass, 
stimulates beiging and promotes a healthy metabolic profile93,94. Vegf 
inhibition has also been shown to reduce metabolic disease in mice, 
although this effect was in the context of obese WAT that was already 
dysfunctional94,95. Further studies will be needed to elucidate the 
mechanism(s) by which VEGF manipulates the fate of adipose tissue 
under different metabolic states.
PGC-1a controls the thermogenic activation of adipocytes
Pgc-1α was discovered as a cold-induced interacting partner of Ppar-γ
in brown fat96. On the basis of hundreds of studies, PGC-1α is now rec￾ognized as a master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis and oxida￾tive metabolism in many cell types. In adipocytes, Pgc-1α also induces 
the expression of Ucp1 and other thermogenic components96,97. 
Surprisingly, however, BAT develops normally without Pgc-1α98, 
probably because of compensation by the related family member

Figure 3 Catecholamine and natriuretic induction of thermogenesis. 
Sympathetic neurons exocytose catecholamines (dark green circles), 
which bind to β-adrenoreceptors, leading to activation of adenylyl cyclase 
(AC), increased cyclic AMP (cAMP; light green circles) concentrations 
and enhanced PKA activity. Natriuretic peptides (NP; red circles) bind 
natriuretic peptide receptor A (Npra), which activates guanylyl cyclase 
(GC) to increase the concentrations of cyclic GMP (cGMP; pink circles), 
leading to activation of PKG. Activated PKA and PKG use similar 
mechanisms to drive transcriptional responses in brown adipocytes 
through the activity of phosphorylated Creb and p38 Mapk. Specifically, 
p38 Mapk phosphorylates and activates Atf2 and Pgc-1α, which 
induce the transcription of downstream thermogenic genes, including 
Ucp1. Pgc-1α binds DNA through interactions with Ppar-γ, Ppar-α, 
retinoid X receptors (Rxrs) and thyroid receptor (TFx). Additionally, 
catecholamines increase the amounts of miR-196a, resulting in increased 
C/ebpβ expression, which helps drive the thermogenic gene program. 
Importantly, activation of PKA and PKG also acutely induces lipolysis.

Figure 4 Secreted factors that recruit brown adipocytes, beige adipocytes 
or both. In rodents, a number of tissues and cell types have been found 
to secrete factors that regulate brown and beige adipose activity through 
systemic, autocrine and paracrine mechanisms. Neurons and alternatively 
activated macrophages secrete norepinephrine; cardiac tissue secretes 
natriuretic peptides; liver and BAT secrete Fgf21; muscle secretes irisin; 
and thyroid secretes the hormone T4 (which is then converted to T3).

Pgc-1β. Although it is not required for tissue development, Pgc-1α
is essential for cold-induced or β-agonist–induced thermogenic acti￾vation of brown adipocytes99,100 and the expression of thermogenic 
genes in WAT101 (Fig. 2). Thus, Pgc-1α is a central transcriptional 
effector of adrenergic activation in thermogenic adipocytes.
Pgc-1α expression and activity are regulated directly by the 
β-adrenergic signaling pathway102, providing a link between the 
physiological activator of brown fat thermogenesis and the tran￾scriptional machinery in brown adipocytes (Fig. 3). Specifically, 
Pgc-1α is phosphorylated and thereby activated by p38 mitogen￾activated protein kinase (MAPK) in response to sympathetic stimula￾tion102,103. Activated Pgc-1α regulates the expression of thermogenic 
genes through its interactions with Ppar-γ, Ppar-α, thyroid recep￾tor and other factors96,104,105, although a detailed mechanism to 
account for its selective effects at brown fat–specific genes is lacking. 
Pgc1a transcription also increases in response to β-adrenergic ago￾nists through increases in the function of activating transcription 
factor-2 (Atf2)102.
Several transcription factors suppress thermogenesis by interfering 
with Pgc-1α activity (Fig. 2). For example, the retinoblastoma family 
members pRb (also called Rb1) and p107 (also called Rbl1) repress 
Pgc-1α transcription to block the expression of brown genes in white 
adipose106,107. Notably, pRb activity declines during the β-adrenergic–
induced beige conversion of WAT107. The nuclear co-repressor Rip140 
(also called Nrip1) binds Pgc-1α and blocks its transcriptional activ￾ity at certain target genes108. The nuclear receptor Lxr-α (also called 
Nr1h3) also blocks Ucp1 expression by recruiting Rip140 and displac￾ing Pgc-1α at an Lxr-binding site109.
Specific functions for the general adipogenic machinery
PPAR-γ and members of the c/EBP protein family orchestrate the 
general differentiation program in all adipose lineages110 but are 
also deployed to activate specific thermogenic genes in brown and 
beige adipocytes. For example, C/ebpβ is present at higher amounts 
in BAT relative to WAT, and its amounts increase further in response 
to cold42. In WAT, β-adrenergic agonists increase the amounts of 
C/ebpβ through miRNA-mediated degradation of Hoxc8, a repressor 
of C/ebpβ transcription111 (Fig. 3). Loss of C/ebpβ is associated with 
defective thermogenesis, whereas increasing the amounts of C/ebpβ
in white fat cells triggers a brown fat transcriptional profile42,112–114.
The master adipogenic factor Ppar-γ also controls the expression 
of brown fat–specific genes, including Ucp1, particularly in response 
to β-adrenergic activators102,103,115. Genome-wide analyses have 
demon­strated that Ppar-γ binds and regulates distinct target genes 
in brown and white fat cells116,117. We recently discovered that Ebf2, 
a helix-loop-helix transcription factor, regulates Ppar-γ activity to 
drive the expression of Prdm16 and a brown fat fate116 (Fig. 2). 
Ebf2 seems to function, at least in part, by facilitating the recruit￾ment of Ppar-γ (and probably other factors) to brown fat–specific 
genes. Ebf2-deficient mice develop fatty tissue with the molecular 
and morphological characteristics of white fat in the areas where 
brown fat normally forms.
Activation of Ppar-γ by synthetic TZD agonists enhances thermo￾genic gene expression in both white and brown adipocytes12,118–122. 
TZDs induce UCP1 expression and increase mitochondrial biogen￾esis in adipocytes from mice and humans12,36,123. This enables TZD￾treated adipocytes to undergo UCP1-mediated increases in respiration 
in response to β-adrenergic activators12,36,43. Mechanistically, TZDs 
seem to act in large part through Prdm16 to activate a thermogenic 
program. In particular, TZD treatment stabilizes Prdm16 protein to 
increase its amounts in fat cells43 and also enhances the interaction 
of Prdm16 with Ppar-γ (Fig. 2). Sirtuin 1 (Sirt1) has a role in this 
TZD-driven process by deacetylating Ppar-γ to facilitate the docking 
of Prdm16. In vivo, activation of Sirt1 promotes the browning of WAT 
and resistance to obesity47, suggesting that Sirt1 activators might have 
a use as weight-loss agents.
In the clinic, TZDs, although associated with unwanted side effects, 
are highly effective in the treatment of type 2 diabetes by enhancing 
insulin action. Given that beige adipocytes improve insulin sensitivity, 
it is reasonable to speculate that TZDs may act, at least in part, by induc￾ing beige fat development. However, non-TZD PPAR-γ modulators 
such as MRL24 promote insulin sensitivity but have little effect on 
Ucp1 expression43,124. Moreover, TZDs are associated with weight 
gain and increased adipocyte development in rodents and humans 
rather than weight loss. This effect may be due to a blunting effect that 
TZDs have on the sympathetic activation of adipocytes125,126, which 
would block UCP1 function. As mentioned earlier, it would be worth 
exploring treatments that combine TZDs with UCP1 activators, such 
as β3-selective adrenergic agonists.
New brown- and beige-fat recruiters and activators
Sympathetic nerve activity was previously widely believed to be the 
primary or only physiological signal that activates BAT thermogen￾esis and induces beige adipocyte development. Although β-AR sig￾naling is undoubtedly a central regulator of these processes, several 
other hormones and factors have now been shown to regulate energy 
expenditure in adipose tissue (Fig. 3) and have been discussed com￾prehensively in recent reviews13,127,128. Here we describe secreted 
and systemic factors that affect brown and beige fat and seem to be 
particularly promising for therapeutic development.
Irisin. In skeletal muscle, Pgc-1α orchestrates the adaptive 
response to exercise, including increased mitochondrial biogen￾esis, switching from fast to slow muscle fibers and angiogenesis129. 
Unexpectedly however, increasing the amounts of Pgc-1α in mus￾cle protects sedentary mice from obesity130. In a search for effectors 
of the enhanced energy expenditure in these animals, Spiegelman 
and his colleagues discovered that the WAT of Pgc-1α transgenic 
mice contained more beige adipocytes than that of wild-type mice60. 
They identified Fndc5 (encoding fibronectin type III domain con￾taining 5) as a Pgc-1α target gene and showed that its product was 
secreted from myocytes in the form of a previously undiscovered 
hormone, which they called irisin. Irisin stimulates the brown￾ing of WAT through specific actions on the beige preadipocyte 
population10 (Fig. 4).
Circulating concentrations of irisin increase in mice and humans 
by exercise training. Remarkably, a modest increase in the serum 
concentrations of irisin in mice stimulates beige fat development, 
leading to enhanced glucose tolerance and suppressed weight gain60. 
Irisin is thus a compelling hormone for clinical development, as it has 
marked beneficial effects when used at near-physiological concentra￾tions in mice.
Of course, as with any new hormone, there are many outstanding 
questions. What is the irisin receptor (or receptors) in beige fat pre￾cursors, and how does it signal to the transcriptional machinery? Is 
the cleavage of Fndc5 into irisin a regulated process? And what effects 
does irisin have on other tissues?
Fibroblast growth factor 21. Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is 
a circulating hormone that regulates systemic energy levels and has

become a focus of clinical trials for obesity, diabetes and cardiovas￾cular disease. In BAT, Fgf21 expression is increased by cold expo￾sure and has an important role in thermogenesis131,132. Interestingly, 
there is a marked burst of Fgf21 production from the neonate liver 
in response to suckling—this effect is probably crucial for activating 
BAT thermogenesis at a time when animals are especially vulnerable 
to hypothermia133. Consistent with this hypothesis, administration of 
Fgf21 to fasted neonates augments the thermogenic gene program in 
BAT. In WAT, Fgf21 increases the amounts of Pgc-1α to drive beige 
adipocyte recruitment in response to cold134,135.
Fgf21 has many desirable effects on metabolism in fed animals, 
including increased glucose uptake into peripheral tissues, improved 
insulin sensitivity and weight reduction134,136,137. Some of these 
actions may be mediated, at least in part, by stimulating fatty acid oxi￾dation and energy dissipation pathways in adipocytes. Unfortunately, 
however, Fgf21 has also been shown to cause bone loss, which will 
need to be overcome if this hormone is to be used for clinical applica￾tions in obesity138.
Natriuretic peptides. Atrial natriuretic peptide and brain-type natri￾uretic peptide are released by the heart in response to heart failure or 
pressure overload. These factors reduce blood volume, blood pressure 
and cardiac output by dilating blood vessels and promoting salt and 
fluid excretion from the kidneys. Atrial natriuretic peptide is also 
known to promote lipolysis in adipocytes. Notably, high circulating 
concentrations of natriuretic peptides have also been associated with 
weight loss in humans139,140.
Bordicchia et al.64 recently discovered that increased concen￾trations of natriuretic peptides in mice promote beige adipocyte 
development in WAT and increase thermogenic gene expression 
in BAT. These changes are due to a direct effect of natriuretic pep￾tides on adipose cells. Mechanistically, natriuretic peptides trigger 
lipolysis and browning through activation of cyclic GMP-dependent 
protein kinase (PKG). PKG works in parallel with the more famil￾iar β-adrenergic–PKA pathway to trigger lipolysis and stimulate 
thermogenesis (Fig. 3).
The effects of natriuretic peptides on brown and beige adipogen￾esis suggest that the control of adaptive thermogenesis is more com￾plex than is currently appreciated. Cardiomyocytes, a cell type that 
is thought to have little crosstalk with adipocytes, can markedly alter 
the gene expression and function of adipose through the secretion of 
potent cardiometabolic hormones64. Importantly, cold increases the 
concentrations of natriuretic peptides, suggesting that this browning 
system may have evolved, perhaps in epicardial fat, to safeguard car￾diac function in animals during cold exposure. Systemic elevation of 
the concentrations of natriuretic peptides would probably have many 
undesirable off-target effects, but pharmacological targeting of this 
pathway in adipocytes could be considered.
BAT activators with central and peripheral actions. Bmp8b is pro￾duced by mature brown fat cells and functions to amplify the ther￾mogenic response of brown adipocytes to adrenergic activators141
(Fig. 4). Interestingly, Bmp8b is also expressed in certain hypothalamic 
nuclei. Injection into the brain with Bmp8b increases the sympathetic 
outflow to BAT but not other tissues and leads to weight loss in mice141. 
Although more studies are needed to assess the effect of Bmp8b on other 
tissues, Bmp8b is a promising target for therapeutics at this stage.
Other factors have been shown to augment BAT activity through 
both central and peripheral actions. For example, thyroid hormone 
directly induces the expression of thermogenic genes in brown 
adipocytes through the actions of thyroid receptors and also func￾tions centrally to activate BAT142–144. Along similar lines, the neuro￾transmitter orexin augments BAT function by regulating sympathetic 
outflow and through directly promoting brown fat precursor differ￾entiation145,146 (Fig. 4). Targeting molecules, such as BMP8B, orexin 
and thyroid hormone, that both recruit and activate brown fat may 
be particularly effective in promoting energy expenditure and weight 
loss in humans.
Outlook and challenges
There is persuasive evidence from animal models that enhance￾ment of the function of brown adipocytes, beige adipocytes or both 
in humans could be very effective for treating type 2 diabetes and 
obesity. Moreover, there are now an extensive variety of factors and 
pathways that could potentially be targeted for therapeutic effects. 
In particular, the discoveries of circulating factors, such as irisin, 
Fgf21 and natriuretic peptides, that enhance brown and beige fat func￾tion in mice have garnered tremendous interest. However, there are 
several issues to consider with regard to therapies targeted at brown 
fat, beige fat or both.
First, many of the thermogenic inducers, such as irisin, Bmp8b, 
orexin, natriuretic peptides and Sirt1, were only identified recently 
as having effects on the biology of brown and beige fat. Although the 
early findings are very promising, many more studies will be needed 
to assess the potency of these factors on brown and beige fat under 
a variety of experimental conditions. As a related point, very few 
studies have explored the mechanisms of brown and beige adipocyte 
recruitment in human cells and tissues. Given the depot-specific 
mechanisms of beige fat recruitment in mice, this trait is probably 
highly variable among human fat depots. Defining the cell type(s) 
within human fat depots that can undergo efficient thermogenic acti￾vation and examining which pathways promote this process will be 
an important avenue of future research.
Second, even if thermogenic tissue can be pharmacologically 
expanded in humans, it must still be efficiently activated. Most avail￾able studies have used mice housed below their thermoneutrality, 
which consequently increased the sympathetic outflow to fat. Thus, 
brown fat– and beige fat–based therapies will probably need to 
expand the number of thermogenic fat cells(s), activate them or both. 
Molecules, such as Bmp8b, that increase the sensitivity of brown fat 
cells to adrenergic stimuli could be particularly valuable.
Third, energy balance is tightly controlled by homeostatic mecha￾nisms. Despite enormous fluctuations in food intake and physical 
activity, the average person shows relative stability in their weight 
over long periods of time. By virtue of this fact, most individuals that 
lose weight tend to gain it back. Even if brown fat thermogenesis can 
be ramped up to increase calorie consumption, the body may com￾pensate for the calorie deficit by increasing hunger or increasing the 
metabolic efficiency of other tissues such as muscle.
