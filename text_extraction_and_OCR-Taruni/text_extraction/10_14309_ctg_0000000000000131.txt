OBJECTIVES: The precipitous increase in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is accompanied by a dramatic
increase in the incidence of NASH-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). HCC in NASH has
a higher propensity to arise without pre-existing cirrhosis compared with other chronic liver
diseases.
METHODS: To identify the potential links between liver and gut in NASH-related hepatocarcinogenesis, we
compared the gut microbiota and mediators of bile acid (BA) signaling in the absence or presence of
cirrhosis through the analysis of stool and serum samples from patients with NASH non-HCC and NASH￾HCC and healthy volunteers.
RESULTS: Serum levels of total and individual BA were higher in NASH compared with healthy controls.
Furthermore, serum levels of the primary conjugated BAs glycine-conjugated cholic acid, taurine￾conjugated cholic acid, glycine-conjugated chenodeoxycholic acid, and taurine-conjugated
chenodeoxycholic acid were significantly increased in cirrhotic vs noncirrhotic patients, independent of
the occurrence of HCC. By contrast, serum FGF19 levels were higher in patients with NASH-HCC and
associated with tumor markers as well as an attenuation of BA synthesis. Specific alterations in the gut
microbiome were found for several bacteria involved in the BA metabolism including Bacteroides and
Lactobacilli. Specifically, the abundance of Lactobacilli was associated with progressive disease,
serum BA levels, and liver injury in NASH and NASH-HCC.
DISCUSSION: Here, we demonstrate a clear association of the altered gut microbiota and primary conjugated BA
composition in cirrhotic and noncirrhotic patients with NASH-HCC. Microbiota-associated alterations
in BA homeostasis and farnesoid X receptor signaling, via FGF19, might thus contribute to fibrogenesis,
liver injury, and tumorigenesis in NASH-HCC.

INTRODUCTION
Worldwide, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the sixth most
common malignancy and the second leading cause of cancer￾related deaths (1). In the Western world, the incidence of HCC is
increasing, with underlying fatty liver disease as a major risk
factor. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) may progress to
nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which is characterized by
inflammation and hepatocellular ballooning (2,3). NASH￾cirrhosis is recognized as risk factor for HCC (4). However,
a significant proportion of patients with NASH develop HCC in

the absence of cirrhosis, which (5,6) is ascribed in part to the
pathophysiological changes related to lipotoxicity, bile acid (BA)
signaling, and inflammation (7–9).
We and others have shown that serum BA concentrations are
elevated in advanced NASH (10–12). BA accumulation induces
parenchymal liver injury and contributes to the progression of
NAFLD (13,14). The cascade of progression from simple steatosis
via NASH to HCC is believed to be orchestrated by a complex
interplay within the gut-liver axis, involving serum BA and the
intestinal microbiome. Several studies have identified BA as im￾portant molecules modulating the gut microbiome in metabolic
disorders (15–17).
Primary BA are synthesized in hepatocytes from cholesterol in
a multistep process involving cholesterol-7-alpha-hydroxylase
(CYP7A1) and secreted into the bile. Its expression is regulated by the
BA-activated nuclear receptor farnesoid X receptor (FXR). FXR and
its hepatic and intestinal target genes NR0B2 encoding the small
heterodimer partner and fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19), tran￾scriptionally regulate BA de novo synthesis, secretion, and reab￾sorption in the enterohepatic circulation (18). In the intestine, BA are
modified by bacteria, reabsorbed from the ileum, and returned to the
hepatocytes through the enterohepatic circulation. Microbiome
alterations may promote the progression of NAFLD (19).
Here, we have explored whether microbial composition might
contribute to NASH-associated hepatocarcinogenesis and
whether this depends on the presence of cirrhosis. Moreover, we
characterized the mediators of BA signaling and identified the
associated alterations in the gut microbiome in patients with
NASH with or without HCC.
METHODS
Sample collection
Patients were recruited at the University Hospital Essen (UHE)
from May 2015 until November 2017. All subjects provided in￾formed written consent, and the UHE Ethics Committee (In￾stitutional Review Board) approved the study (reference: 14-
6044-BO). The study protocol conformed to the ethical guidelines
of the Declaration of Helsinki.
Subjects were divided into 5 groups (NASH-non-HCC,
NASH-non-HCC-cirrhosis, NASH-HCC, NASH-HCC￾cirrhosis, and healthy controls). NASH was diagnosed by ultra￾sonography and/or according to histological features, when
available, in the presence of obesity and/or metabolic syndrome.
HCC was diagnosed according to the EASL guidelines (20).
Cirrhosis was diagnosed by histology or clinical signs of portal
hypertension. Patients with a history of alcohol intake or those
with viral hepatitis were excluded. Serum samples were collected
in fasted state and stored in aliquots at 280 °C until used for
analysis. Standard laboratory parameters were evaluated by the
central laboratory of the UHE.
All experimental procedures and analyses are described in the
supplementary material section, http://links.lww.com/CTG/A215.
RESULTS
Characteristics of the study cohort
Eighty-seven subjects, including healthy controls (H, n 5 20),
NASH-non-HCC without (N, n 5 23) or with cirrhosis (Nc, n 5
11), and NASH-HCC without (NH, n 5 14) or with cirrhosis
(NHc, n 5 19) were recruited. Controls were younger than
patients with a mean BMI of 23.3 kg/m2
, whereas the majority of
NASH-non-HCC and NASH-HCC patients were overweight or
obese. Demographic data of individual groups are depicted in
Table S1, Supplementary Digital Content 1, http://links.lww.
com/CTG/A215.
Distinctive patterns of liver injury markers and fibrosis in NASH
with and without HCC
Increased levels of ALT, AST, AP, and gGT were observed in
NASH-non-HCC and NASH-HCC vs controls (see Table S1,
Supplementary Digital Content 1, http://links.lww.com/CTG/
A215). Similar to transaminases, in NASH-non-HCC, IL-6 levels,
as a marker of hepatic inflammatory response, were higher in
noncirrhotic patients and further increased in NHc (see Figure
S1A, Supplementary Digital Content 1, http://links.lww.com/
CTG/A212). We then assessed the serum levels of 2 distinct
cytokeratin-18 fragments, the cell death marker M65 and the he￾patocellular apoptosis marker M30. Both markers were signifi￾cantly elevated in NASH-non-HCC and NASH-HCC compared
with controls and further increased in cirrhotics (Figure 1a,b).
We combined the FibroScan liver stiffness measurement
(LSM) with the controlled attenuation parameter to assess he￾patic fat accumulation. The controlled attenuation parameter was
significantly higher in NASH-non-HCC and NASH-HCC com￾pared with controls (see Figure S1B, Supplementary Digital
Content 1, http://links.lww.com/CTG/A212). We observed an
increase of LSM in NASH-non-HCC and NASH-HCC, which
was higher in individuals with cirrhosis (Figure 1c). Because as￾sessment of LSM by FibroScan might be compromised in HCC
because of tumor stiffness, we also calculated the NAFLD fibrosis
score (21). Here, N showed significantly lower values than indi￾viduals with cirrhosis or HCC (Nc, NH, and NHc; Figure 1d).
Association of serum BA with liver injury and advanced fibrosis
We quantified the total serum BA and detected a significant in￾crease associated with disease severity between healthy, NASH￾non-HCC, and NASH-HCC. Furthermore, BA was altered as
a function of cirrhosis (Figure 2a). In Nc and NHc, BA was in￾creased compared with noncirrhotic patients. Serum levels of 7a￾Hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one (C4), an intermediate of BA de novo
synthesis, reflect the activity of the BA synthetic pathway. Al￾though the total BAs were increased in patients, C4-levels were
only slightly increased in NASH-non-HCC and even decreased in
NASH-HCC, indicating alterations in BA synthesis or export in
NASH-HCC (Figure 2b). The total BA was significantly associ￾ated with LSM and NAFLD fibrosis score (Table 1). BA levels
were also associated with serum markers of liver injury and the
tumor marker AFP-L3 (Table 1).
Specific primary conjugated BA is associated with
advanced fibrosis
Dysregulation of BA homeostasis and its association with liver
injury has previously been described in obese individuals and
plays a pivotal role in NAFLD (14). Here, we quantified the serum
and fecal concentrations of BA isoforms. Although the total se￾rum BA was elevated in cirrhotic patients, levels of both primary
and secondary unconjugated BA were not changed significantly
comparing the groups (see Figure S1C,D, Supplementary Digital
Content 1, http://links.lww.com/CTG/A212). In line with the
abovementioned decrease in C4, serum concentrations of the
primary unconjugated BA cholate (CA) appeared lower in
NASH-HCC as compared to NASH-non-HCC, whereas cheno￾deoxycholic acid (CDCA) levels were slightly increased in

patients, with even higher levels in Nc and NHc (Table 2). In
contrast to secondary conjugated and unconjugated BA, serum
concentrations of all conjugated primary BA were increased in
NASH-non-HCC and NASH-HCC, with significantly higher
levels in Nc and NHc (Table 2, Figure 1c, see Figure 1E, Sup￾plementary Digital Content 1, http://links.lww.com/CTG/A212).
Primary conjugated BAs were significantly increased in cirrhotic
patients (Figure 1c) and were associated with liver injury and
tumor markers (see Table S2, Supplementary Digital Content 1,
http://links.lww.com/CTG/A215).
In cell culture experiments with primary human HSC treated
with primary conjugated BA for 24 hours,we observed an induction
of the early profibrotic gene TGFb1 (see Figure 2A, Supplementary
Digital Content 1, http://links.lww.com/CTG/A213), underlining
a pivotal role for primary conjugated BA in fibrogenesis. In contrast
to serum levels, fecal BA quantification revealed no significant
alterations in the primary conjugated BAs (see Table S3, Supple￾mentary Digital Content 1, http://links.lww.com/CTG/A215).
FGF19 levels are associated with hepatocellular injury and
tumor burden
Intestine-derived FGF19 suppresses the hepatic de novo BA
synthesis and its expression is controlled by FXR. Serum FGF19
levels were significantly higher in NHc compared with NASH￾non-HCC and controls (Figure 2d), whereas C4 levels as in￾termediate of BA synthesis showed the opposite pattern
(Figure 2b). Interestingly, serum levels of the primary
unconjugated BA CA and CDCA were again highest in NASH￾HCC, indicating mechanisms other than FGF19 involved in the
regulation of later BA synthesis steps in NASH-HCC.
We have previously identified adiponectin to interfere with
FGF19 signaling because it repressed Cyp7A1 expression in vivo
and in vitro (10). Here, we could show that serum adiponectin was
increased in NASH, regardless of HCC occurrence, and an
adiponectin/FGF19 ratio paralleled serum C4 levels, indicating
a potential synergistic effect in NASH-HCC (see Figure S2B,
Supplementary Digital Content 1, http://links.lww.com/CTG/
A212). IL-6, which is known to induce adiponectin expression and
is a parameter of liver injury and obesity-related systemic in￾flammation, followed a similar pattern (see Figure S1A, Supple￾mentary Digital Content 1, http://links.lww.com/CTG/A212). IL-6
was associated with the total serum BA (see Figure S2C, Supple￾mentary Digital Content 1, http://links.lww.com/CTG/A213).
As expected, levels of the tumor marker AFP were significantly
increased in NASH-HCC (see Figure 2D, Supplementary Digital
Content 1, http://links.lww.com/CTG/A213). FGF19 levels were
significantly associated with cell death and tumor markers (see
Table S3, Supplementary Digital Content 1, http://links.lww.
com/CTG/A215).
Alterations in the gut bacterial community, diversity, and
richness in NASH-HCC
Stool samples failed to identify the group-specific microbiota
profiles in any of the phylogeny ranks (see Figure S3A,
Figure 1. Severity of the disease is associated with cell death, cirrhosis, and increased bile acid levels. Serum levels of cell death marker M65 (a) and
apoptosis marker M30 (b) were increased stepwise in NASH-non-HCC and NASH-HCC as compared to controls. Fibrosis as assessed by liver stiffness
measurement (LSM) by transient elastography/FibroScan (c) and NAFLD fibrosis score (d) reveal higher values in NASH-non-HCC and NASH-HCC while of
course those individuals with biopsy proven cirrhosis showed higher levels. In patients with an NAFLD fibrosis score above 0.675, the presence of advanced
liver fibrosis can be diagnosed with high accuracy. In patients with an NAFLD fibrosis score below 21.455, advanced liver fibrosis can be excluded with high
accuracy. Scores between 21.455 and 0.676 are considered “indeterminate” (21). Data are presented as mean 6 SEM. *P , 0.05, **P , 0.01,

A214). In controls, the consistency between bacterial communi￾ties converged to higher similarities (see Figure S3B, Supple￾mentary Digital Content 1, http://links.lww.com/CTG/A214).
Accordingly, in controls, the bacterial community displayed low
variability, with controls showing a similarity in bacterial com￾munity of more than 70%. By contrast, patients showed more
diverse bacterial community and diminished similarity between
individuals.
The phylotype richness, Shannon, and Simpson indexes as
parameters of diversity differed between groups. We observed
the most obvious differences between H and NHc. By contrast,
the relative rarity index was increased in patients compared with
controls (Figure 3a). The results at the family level demonstrated
that few bacterial groups comprised the main part of the total
community that were uniformly detected in all individuals,
whereas in NHc, a higher bacterial community complexity was
found (Figure 3c).
Abundance of individual phylae distinguishes NASH-non-HCC
from NASH-HCC
The most abundant phylotypes belonged to the phyla Bacter￾oidetes, Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and
Fusobacteria comprised approximately 99% of the total bac￾terial community (Figure 3d). Bacteroidetes and to a lesser
extent Actinobacteria were gradually decreased in abundance
from H to NASH-non-HCC to NASH-HCC. The abundances
of Firmicutes and Fusobacteria did not show relevant alter￾ations, whereas high abundance of single phylotypes in 4
individuals significantly affects the abundance of Fusobacteria.
Figure 2. Cirrhosis affects the regulation of bile acid metabolism. Total serum bile acids (a) and primary conjugated bile acids (c) showed a stepwise increase
in NASH-non-HCC and NASH-HCC. Serum levels of 7-alpha-Hydroxy-4-Cholesten-3-one (C4) (b) were slightly increased in NASH-non-HCC patients but
decreased in NASH-HCC patients. Serum levels of the FXR target molecule FGF19 (d) were increased in NASH-HCC patients with cirrhosis. Data are

The abundance of Proteobacteria was significantly increased
in NHc.
Altered abundance of BA-modifying bacteria in NASH-non-HCC
and NASH-HCC
Overall, Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes were the dominant bacte￾rial strains in patients. In NASH-HCC, low abundance of Bac￾teroidetes promoted the occurrence of smaller bacterial strains.
Certain members of bacterial genera are involved in BA
deconjugation, oxidation/epimerization, and 7-dehydroxylation
(22). Genera that belong to these groups and were identified
during the microbiome analysis include Bacteroides, Bifido￾bacterium, Lactobacillus, Ruminococcus, Clostridium, and
Escherichia/Shighella. The abundances of Bacteroides and Bifi￾dobacterium were decreased in NASH-non-HCC and NASH￾HCC compared with controls, whereas the abundance of Bac￾teroides was lowest in NH (Figure 4a,b). Lactobacillus showed
a progressive increase in abundance from controls to NHc
(Figure 4c). The abundance of Ruminococcus was increased in
NH, whereas the abundance of Clostridium and Escherichia/
Shighella remained unchanged (Figure 4d–f).
Interestingly, the analysis of Lactobacillus-related ranks
showed a progressive increase in abundance in the ranks class,
order, family, and phylotype (Phy60) from controls to NHc
(Figure 5). Correlations of individual serum parameters or single
BA with changes in the abundance of Lactobacillus showed that
total BA, primary conjugated BA and the individual BA glycine￾conjugated cholic acid (GCA), glycine-conjugated chenodeox￾ycholic acid (GCDCA), taurine-conjugated cholic acid (TCA),
and taurine-conjugated chenodeoxycholic acid (TCDCA) were
associated with the abundance of Lactobacillus (Table 3).
Translationally, this abundance was associated with LSM and
gGT (Table 3).
DISCUSSION
Here, we analyzed gut microbiome alterations, BA composition,
and serum parameters of the BA metabolism in NASH-HCC.
Therefore, we noninvasively assessed liver injury, fibrosis, and

Microbiota and Bile Acid Signaling in NASH-HCC 5

BA metabolism, as well as gut microbiome composition in
healthy individuals compared with patients with NASH with
and without HCC and with and without cirrhosis. Total serum
and primary conjugated BAs were clearly associated with
advanced fibrosis in NASH-HCC, indicating a potential role
in fibrosis-related tumorigenesis (10,12,23). These alterations
were accompanied by an increased abundance of several
bacterial strains, particularly Lactobacilli and Bacteroides,
which predominantly express bile salt hydrolase (BSH), an
enzyme involved in deconjugation. Abundance of Lactobacilli
was as well associated with liver stiffness and injury and most
likely secondary to the high availability of primary conjugated
BAs as a substrate (22). In individuals with NASH, Jiao et al.
observed a similar shift in abundance of BSH expressing bac￾teria. Here, an increase in BA levels and an altered composition

was observed (24). Although we observed a similar trend in our
cohort, the increase of secondary conjugated BA was not sig￾nificant. Given the lack of liver biopsies, it was impossible for
us to measure the gene-expression levels of the BA

metabolism–related genes (e.g., CYP7A1). However, when
assessing the serum C4 levels, we found no evidence of in￾creased BA synthesis. Although C4 levels were increased in
NASH non-HCC, they did not correlate with the overall BA
levels in our cohort. Interestingly, Jiao et al. reported that
FGF19 was lower in a cohort of patients with NASH, but no
distinction was made between cirrhosis and noncirrhosis in
this study. In our cohort, the FGF19 levels were higher in
cirrhotic patients, but we did not observe significant associa￾tions with other parameters of BA metabolism.

Microbiota and Bile Acid Signaling in NASH-HCC 7

By contrast, as an important mediator of BA metabolism and
key messenger between the gut and liver, elevated FGF19 levels
were associated with tumor and cell-death markers in HCC, in￾dependent of fibrosis assessment. This interrelation affects the
early steps of primary hepatic BA synthesis while serum adipo￾kines and inflammation appear to further modify primary BA
synthesis in NASH-HCC. This finding is of particular interest
because FGF19 expression is known to correlate with tumor
progression and poorer prognosis in HCC and is associated with
wnt/b-catenin signaling (25,26).
Gut-liver interactions as well as diet-induced alterations in
gut and metabolic homeostasis are increasingly implicated in
NASH and NASH-HCC. Distinct changes or shifts in the
composition of intestinal bacteria have been described for sev￾eral metabolic and inflammatory diseases (27–29). The effects of
the gut microbiome on liver inflammation exceed the role of
bacteria-derived toxins and lipopolysaccharides. In fact, the
metabolism of distinct bacterial groups affects the mucosal
barrier, hepatic inflammation, fibrogenesis, and tumorigenesis
(30,31). Gut microbiota have an impact on energy balance, al￾tering the uptake of calories derived from food or alcohol (32).
Emerging data indicate that certain characteristic changes in the
gut microbiome are associated with NAFLD and cirrhosis
(14,29,48,49). As mentioned above, we identified the abundance
of the BA deconjugating Lactobacilli in patients with NASH and
NASH-HCC with advanced fibrosis. In obese children, an in￾creased abundance of Lactobacillus strains was associated with
NAFLD and NASH (33). Although the biological function
remains unclear, several publications indicate a beneficial effect
of these strains. In colon cancer, increased Lactobacillus abun￾dance was related to antitumor effects (34,35). Beyond these
observations, we did not detect a more prominent effect on the
Figure 5. Taxonomic ranks that are related to Lactobacillus showed a progressive increase in abundance from healthy to cirrhotic NASH-HCC patients. The
taxonomic ranks class (Bacilli, a), order (Lactobacillales, b), family (Lactobacillaceae, c), and phylotype (Phy60 Lactobacillus, d) showed a progressive

microbiome because of cirrhosis nor a specific signature for
NASH cirrhosis (49).
An altered composition of the individual BA pool may trigger
hepatic inflammation during NAFLD progression and thus,
promote HCC-tumorigenesis. We previously demonstrated that
in morbidly obese patients with NASH, BA levels were increased
compared with milder stages of NAFLD (10). This was recently
confirmed by Puri et al., (12) who found that altered circulating
BA levels correlate with the severity and progression of NAFLD,
and abundance of conjugated cholate was associated with ad￾vanced fibrosis. Primary BAs are synthesized in hepatocytes from
cholesterol and after conjugation to glycine or taurine are ex￾creted from the liver. Gut bacteria affect the BA composition, as
they convert primary to secondary BA via dehydroxylation and
deconjugation. There are specific groups of BA-modifying bac￾terial strains that are involved in converting primary BA to dif￾ferent secondary BA finally forming the complex BA pool (22).
We here identified specific alteration of abundance of BA con￾verting strains, which correlate with total and primary conjugated
BA. In line with our observations, Ponziani et al. correlated
changes within the gut microbiome with an influence on in￾flammation and hepatocarcinogenesis in cirrhotic HCC patients
compared with noncirrhotic HCC patients. Here, among other
strains, abundance of Bacteroides was also increased in HCC (29).
The composition of the intestinal microbiome, therefore, also
affects the composition of BA pool and vice versa. Dysbiosis in the
fecal microbiome composition alters the composition of the BA
pool and has been described in NAFLD (14) or NASH (24, Jiao).
Hepatocellular BA accumulation causes cytotoxicity and leads to
mitochondrial stress, triggers cell death, inflammation, and
hepatocarcinogenesis (17,36). The cytotoxic effect of BA is de￾pendent of the composition of the BA pool, where hydrophobic
BA exhibit more toxicity (37). More specifically, dysbiosis￾associated gut microbial BA metabolites such as DCA have been
linked to HSC senescence and hepatic carcinogenesis. Con￾versely, modulation of the gut microbiome by antibiotic therapy
reduced hepatic carcinogenesis in a high fat diet mouse model of
NASH, which was associated with a reduction in DCA (17).
However, in this cohort, we did not observe such an increase in
distinct “toxic” BA.
Furthermore, levels of hydrophobic BA such as TCDCA and
TLCA are altered in high fat diet mouse models and may con￾tribute to carcinogenesis in NASH by promoting cell proliferation
and inflammation (38). In a rodent model of NASH, BA and
cholesterol levels were increased and manipulation of the
microbiome by antibiotic treatment reduced the accumulation of
secondary BA (39). Other studies demonstrated that levels of
TCA, TCDCA, GCA, and GCDCA were significantly increased in
patients with cirrhosis and NASH-HCC (40,41). In our cohort,
total and primary conjugated BAs were increased in non-HCC
and HCC with higher levels in cirrhotics. Furthermore, total and
primary conjugated BAs are associated with increased fibrosis,
liver injury, and tumor markers. Individual BAs have previously
been described to induce HSC proliferation, which is an essential
and important mechanism of fibrogenesis (42) and indeed, here
we found GCA-, TCA-, GCDCA-, and TCDCA-induced TGFb1
expression in HSC in vitro. We thus propose that higher levels of
individual BA, and especially primary conjugated BA, are asso￾ciated with HSC activation and fibrogenesis in cirrhosis, and this
might contribute to tumorigenesis via induction of fibrosis.
The main molecule connecting BA homeostasis in the gut liver
axis is the FXR target molecule FGF19. Enterocyte-derived FXR is
activated by BA and regulates hepatic de novo primary BA
synthesis via excretion of FGF19. FGF19 is increased in HCC
and associated with a poor prognosis (43). As a consequence,
FGF19 is considered as a promising target in HCC therapy
(44,45). BA and synthetic FXR agonists are used to prevent BA
overload and cholestatic hepatocellular injury in NAFLD (46).
Although UDCA reduced FGF19 levels (47), OCA and other
FXR agonists tested in the treatment for NASH, induced
FGF19 levels (48). The FGFR4-Klothob signaling pathway
plays a pivotal role as a driver in certain subtypes of HCC.
FGF401 is a highly selective FGFR4 antagonist and pre￾liminary data of a recent clinical trial showed promising
clinical effects in patients with HCC (49). We found that
FGF19 levels were elevated in NASH-HCC but not in NASH
with highest levels in NHc. In the HCC cohort, serum levels of
AFP were positively correlated to FGF-19, indicating a poten￾tial role of the FGF19/FGFR4 pathway in hepatocarcino￾genesis. In line with our previous observations and data
derived from recent publications, we assume an induction of
BA synthesis in advanced NASH, which might be attributed to
alterations in death receptor expression and adipokine sig￾naling, affecting the FGF19/FGFR4 pathway (10,12). However,
we observed a discrepancy between serum levels of the BA
synthesis intermediate C4 and serum levels of primary un￾conjugated BAs indicating further alterations in later steps of
hepatic BA synthesis or export, which might be related to
alterations in serum adiponectin or IL-6 in NASH-HCC.
Probiotic treatment may reduce BA levels via the FGF19 axis
(50,51). In our study, FGF19 levels were highest in NHc but the
increase of FGF19 was more likely related to carcinogenesis
than to cirrhosis.
Although we observed striking alterations in FGF19 signaling,
associated with NASH-HCC on the one hand and significant
changes in BA homeostasis associated with fibrosis on the other
hand, it remains unclear whether these mechanisms occur

independently or synergistically during hepatocarcinogenesis.
Another limiting factor of this study is that the dietary fat intake
was neglected as an influencing factor both on the BA metabolism
and on the development and the progress of NASH. Based on our
findings, further analysis of this interaction is needed in future
studies, including data from multicenter studies and generation
of longitudinal data to develop potential therapeutic options
based on targeted modifications of the BA profile, dietary factors,
and the gut microbiome.

Study Highlights
WHAT IS KNOWN
3 Serum bile acid levels are increased in subjects with NAFLD
and are associated with disease severity.
3 Alterations in gut microbiota were previously identified as
important mediators in disease progression of NAFLD and
NASH.
3 These alterations are associated with accumulation of
specific “toxic” metabolites involved in hepatic inflammation
and carcinogenesis.
WHAT IS NEW HERE
3 We present data linking the interaction of liver and gut in
NASH-related HCC in the absence or presence of cirrhosis.
3 FGF19 levels were associated with attenuation of early steps
of hepatic BA synthesis, advanced tumor burden and liver
injury in NASH-HCC, independent of liver fibrosis. Hepatic BA
synthesis or export appears to be further affected by
adipocytokines and systemic inflammation.
3 In NASH-HCC, we identified specific alterations in gut
microbiota associated with BA metabolism, specifically the
availability of substrates for biles salt hydrolase, an enzyme
involved in BA deconjugation. These alterations were
associated with hepatic fibrosis and injury.
TRANSLATIONAL IMPACT
3 While FGF19 is associated with tumorigenesis in NASH-HCC,
independent of fibrosis, cirrhosis-specific alterations in
primary unconjugated BAs in NASH-HCC and the associated
abundance of gut bacteria indicate two distinct mechanisms
in hepatocarcinogenesis and thus represent potential targets
for therapeutic approaches.
