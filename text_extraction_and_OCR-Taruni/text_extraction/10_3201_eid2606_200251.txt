The outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) 
was first reported on December 31, 2019, in 
Wuhan, China (1). Within a few weeks, the virus 
had spread rapidly throughout China and within 
1 month to several other countries, including Italy 
(2), the United States (3), and Germany (4). Difficulty 
controlling such aggressive spread resulted partly 
from the size of Wuhan, which has a full-time popu￾lation of >9 million and a transient population of an 
additional 5.10 million, for a total population of ≈14 
million (5,6). Wuhan is located in central China and 
has a wide range of transportation links, including 
airplanes, trains, interstate buses, and private trans￾portation. In an attempt to reduce virus transmis￾sion, on January 23, 2020, authorities locked down 
Wuhan, but by that time, ≈5 million persons had 
already left (7). Reasons for leaving included return￾ing to hometowns for the Chinese New Year (most 
persons) or leaving for holidays, but some left be￾cause of fear of COVID-19 (7). Consequently, CO￾VID-19 has now been identified in every province or 
autonomous region in China, although the highest 
number of cases is still in Wuhan (7).
Gansu Province is located in northwestern Chi￾na, and as of February 3, 2020, the number of CO￾VID-19 cases identified has been small, most in per￾sons coming from Wuhan. As of January 23, the date 
of the Wuhan lockdown, the Gansu Provincial Cen￾tre for Disease Control and Prevention (Lanzhou, 
China) had identified only 2 cases of COVID-19 in 
Lanzhou, the capital of Ganzu Province: 1 patient 
had traveled from Wuhan and another had been 
in contact with persons from Wuhan (8). Within 2 
weeks, however, 54 cases of COVID-19 in Gansu 
Province were confirmed, indicating the seriousness 
of this outbreak and triggering the alarm for the 
Gansu Province government to make it mandatory 
that face masks be worn in public places from Janu￾ary 28 until further notice (9). From a public health 
point of view, the epidemiology of the COVID-19 
event in Lanzhou (10), a relatively remote region of 
China, may provide critical information to help con￾trol the spread of this disease to other provinces and 
countries. We therefore explored the epidemiology 
of COVID-19 in Gansu Province, remote from the 
outbreak epicenter in Wuhan.

To determine the epidemiology of coronavirus disease 
(COVID-19) in a remote region of China, far from Wu￾han, we analyzed the epidemiology of COVID-19 in Gan￾su Province. From January 23 through February 3, 2020, 
a total of 35 (64.8%) of 54 reported cases were imported 
from COVID-19–epidemic areas. Characteristics that dif￾fered significantly during the first and second waves of 
illness in Gansu Province were mean patient age, oc￾cupation, having visited epidemic areas, and mode of 
transportation. Time from infection to illness onset for 
family clusters was shorter in Gansu Province than in 
Wuhan, consistent with shortened durations from onset 
to first medical visit or hospitalization. Spatial distribution 
pattern analysis indicated hot spots and spatial outliers 
in Gansu Province. As a result of adequate interventions, 
transmission of the COVID-19 virus in Gansu Province 
is decreasing.

confirmed case of COVID-19 reported in Gansu 
Province, and continued through January 28, the 
date when the Gansu government decreed it man￾datory to wear face masks in public places. The late 
period, the subsequent 6 days, extended from Janu￾ary 29 through February 3. To analyze the epidemi￾ology of the COVID-19 outbreak in Gansu Province, 
we compared cases diagnosed during the early and 
late periods. Our aim was to compare groups to 
determine if the restriction order was effective for 
controlling transmission. The definition of primary 
versus secondary cases refers to whether persons 
traveled from Wuhan (primary) or never left Gansu 
Province (secondary). The aim of this distinction 
was to explore potential transmission.
The first wave of infection was seen in persons 
who arrived from Wuhan, whereas later infections 
resulted from virus transmission from the first group 
of persons. To compare the demographic and clini￾cal characteristics of persons with primary and sec￾ondary infection, we collected data about transmis￾sion and family clusters, including the date of return 
from epidemic areas, first day of close contact, date 
of symptom onset, date of first medical visit and hos￾pitalization, and relationships between patients with 
primary and secondary cases.
Setting
Gansu Province (32°31′N–42°57′N, 92°13′E–108°46′E ) 
is located in northwestern China (Figure 1). Gansu is 
the seventh largest province in China, comprising 12 
prefecture-level cities and 2 autonomous prefectures 
(86 counties and districts), with a total land area of 
454,000 km2 and a population of 26,257,100 in 2019 
(11). It is a long, handle-shaped province, and Lan￾zhou is located on the Yellow River. The complex 
landforms of Gansu Province include mountainous 
regions, plateaus, plains, river valleys, and desert. 
With a population of 3.8 million and 13,100 km2, the 
population density of Lanzhou is 287 persons/km2 
(Figure 2), although Lanzhou is classified as a third￾tier city in China (10).
Materials
COVID-19 diagnoses in Gansu Province from Janu￾ary 23 through February 3, 2020, were confirmed in 
the laboratory of Gansu Provincial Centre for Dis￾ease Control and Prevention (12). Suspected cases of 
COVID-19 infection were identified in hospitals and 
confirmed in the same laboratory by specific nucleic 
acids. We collected demographic data, including pa￾tient sex, age, occupation, place of residence, and ex￾posure history, from the official website of the Gansu

Within each prefecture or prefecture-level city in 
Gansu Province are districts, counties or autonomous 
counties, and county-level cities. For this study, we 
classified all counties and county-level cities as coun￾ties for simplicity and for data analysis. To conduct a 
geographic information system (GIS)–based analysis 
on the spatial distribution of COVID-19 cases, we ap￾plied the county-level polygon map (county layers) 
at 1:250,000 scale from Data Sharing Infrastructure of 
Earth System Science (http://www.geodata.cn), on 
which we generated a county-level layer containing 
information regarding latitudes and longitudes of 
cases in county layers (central points) of each county.
Statistical Analyses
The 54 patients were assigned numbers from 1 to 54 
according to time of diagnosis. The statistical descrip￾tions included demographic characteristics, exposure 
history, whether the cases were primary or secondary, 
and potential spread of disease. Because the ages of 
case-patients were not normally distributed, we per￾formed nonparametric Brown-Mood tests to compare 
medians between early and late cases. For expected 
cell sizes <5, we used the Fisher exact test to compare 
the frequency between or among groups; otherwise, 
we used the χ2
 test. We estimated days from illness 
onset to first medical visit and days from illness onset 
to hospitalization by fitting a Weibull distribution to 
the dates of illness onset, first medical visit, and hos￾pital admission (13).
GIS Mapping and Spatial Analyses
We geocoded all COVID-19 cases and matched them 
to the county-level layers of polygon and point by

administrative codes by using ArcGIS 10.2.2 software 
(https://www.arcgis.com). To explore the spatial 
distribution pattern of COVID-19 cases on the county 
level during the study periods, we applied local indi￾cators of spatial association (LISA [14]). Using LISA, 
we could identify the type and degree of spatial clus￾tering, including significant hot spots (high-high), 
cold spots (low-low), and spatial outliers (high-low 
and low-high) between a given location and sur￾rounding spatial units by calculating the local Mo￾ran’s I (14,15). We used the Z statistic to determine the 
significance of clustering based on a significance level 
of 0.05. A significant positive Z indicates high-value 
regions surrounded by high-value regions (high￾high) or low value regions surrounded by low-value 
regions (low-low). A significant negative Z indicates 
high-value regions surrounded by low-value regions 
(high-low) or low-value regions surrounded by high￾value regions (low-high) (16).
Ethics Approval
Our study was approved by the institutional review 
board, Gansu University of Chinese Medicine. We 
collected data from the official website of Gansu 
Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, 
which was considered exempt from approval.
Results
Patient Characteristics
Of the total 54 cases of COVID-19 in Gansu Province, 
35 were imported primary and 19 were indigenous 
secondary cases. Serious/critical illness was experi￾enced by 6 (17.1%) of the 35 patients with primary 
cases and by 3 (15.7%) of the 19 patients with sec￾ondary cases; the difference was not significant (p = 
0.899). A total of 24 cases were reported during the 
early period and 30 during the late period (Figure 3). 
On January 26, the first secondary case of COVID-19 
was identified in Longnan, a city located in south￾ern of Gansu Province. The youngest patient was 1 
year and 8 months of age; the oldest was 94 years of 
age. We used Cox proportional hazards regression to 
correct for covariates but found no significant differ￾ences between the early and late groups. No survival 
pattern could be calculated because, to date, no CO￾VID-19–associated deaths in Gansu Province have 
been reported.

COVID-19 in Gansu Province, China, 2020
Comparing patients who sought care in the early 
and late periods, we found significant differences for 
age (median age 34 years for the early period vs. 48 
years for the late period; p = 0.014) and for occupa￾tion (more laborers in the early period vs. more re￾tired persons in the late period; p = 0.009) but not for 
patient sex or whether the patients lived in urban or 
rural areas (Table 1). In addition, more case-patients 
in the early period had visited epidemic areas (p = 
0.043) and returned to their destination (p = 0.024) 
than had patients in the late period.
Key Time-to-Event Distributions of COVID-19 
For the 54 cases of COVID-19 diagnosed in Gansu 
Province from January 23 through February 3, the 
days from illness onset to first medical visit ranged 
from 0 to 10 and the days from first medical visit to 
hospitalization ranged from 0 to 7. The days from 
infection to symptom onset for 19 case-patients in a 
family cluster, confirmed by epidemiologic survey, 
ranged from 2 to 10 days (mean 6.7 days); the 95th 
percentile of the distribution was 12.5 days (95% CI 
9.2–18 days) (Table 2; Figure 4, panel A). Among 
the 24 COVID-19 cases confirmed in the early pe￾riod, the estimated mean time from illness onset 
to first medical visit was 2.8 days (95% CI 1.7–3.8); 
that is, there was a trend toward longer delay for 
case-patients in the early period than the mean of 
2.3 days (95% CI 1.3–3.2) for the 30 case-patients in 
the late period (Figure 4, panel B), but this differ￾ence did not reach statistical significance (p>0.05). 
The mean duration from first medical visit to hos￾pital admission was 1.9 days (95% CI 1.2–2.6 days) 
among 24 case-patients with illness onset during 
the early period, shorter than among 30 case-pa￾tients with illness onset during the second period, 
among whom the mean duration from first medi￾cal visit to hospital admission was 3.3 days (95% CI 
2.7–4.0 days) (Figure 4, panel C).
Spatial Distribution of COVID-19 
The 54 COVID-19 cases reported in Gansu Province 
from January 23 through February 3 were distrib￾uted in 11 prefectures and 24 counties. The 2 cities 
with the most COVID-19 case-patients were Lan￾zhou (26 cases) and Tianshui (8 cases). The area with 
the most COVID-19 cases was Chengguan District, 
the political and economic center of Lanzhou (Figure 
5, panel A). Patients with secondary cases seem to 
have been infected by persons with primary cases; 
we identified 6 family clusters: 3 in Lanzhou, 1 in 
Tianshui, 1 in Longnan, and 1 in Linxia. LISA analy￾sis demonstrated hot spots (high-high) and outliers 
(high-low and low-high). The high-high cluster in￾cluded 4 counties, accounting for 4.55% of all coun￾ties, mainly distributed in the eastern capital city of 
Lanzhou. High-low and low-high outliers were spo￾radically distributed in eastern-central Gansu Prov￾ince (Figure 5, panel B).
Discussion
Our data suggest that most COVID-19 cases that oc￾curred in the first 6 days (January 23–28, 2020) were 
imported from Wuhan (the coronavirus epicenter). 
Most secondary cases occurred in the second 6 days 
(January 29–February 3, 2020).

In Gansu Province, the patients identified in the 
early period were younger than those identified in the 
late period, but overall the 54 patients were younger 
(median age 38 years) than patients identified in the 
early stage of the outbreak in Wuhan (median age 59 
years) (13). This finding is most likely because Wuhan 
is where the outbreak originated in China (17). Patients 
from the early period were younger and had mainly 
imported primary cases, possibly because most of them 
were labor workers in Wuhan who traveled back to 
Gansu Province; in contrast, a greater proportion of 
patients in the late period were senior retirees with sec￾ondary indigenous cases. The proportions of COVID-19 
patients who had visited an epidemic area and the fre￾quencies of transfer were 3 times greater during the 
early than the late period, suggesting that exposure risk 
would decrease from epidemic areas and public places 
as the epidemic spread. The current situation may re￾sult from the travel bans from Wuhan or other places as 
well as most persons’ awareness and education about 
COVID-19 (18), but human transportation had spread 
the virus before Wuhan was locked down. (19).
In our study, distribution of illness by sex did not 
differ significantly between the early and late periods, 
but female patients predominated slightly. In contrast, 
Chen and colleagues reported more male than female 
patients in the Wuhan outbreak (20). One possible ex￾planation is that in Wuhan, men dominate the labor 
market and probably had close contact with the sea￾food market in Wuhan (the source of the outbreak), 
resulting in more male patients in the Wuhan study. In 
contrast, the COVID-19 outbreak in Gansu was 2 weeks 
later, during the Chinese New Year festival, in which 
family members of both sexes participated. Thus, our 
data further support the need for broad infection con￾trol measures in surrounding areas, irrespective of age, 
sex, place of residence, or mode of transportation.
The first case of secondary infection was identi￾fied in a patient who had had close contact with the 
first case-patient with primary COVID-19 in Gansu 
Province, after a lag of 4 days. Subsequently, 6 fam￾ily clusters were identified over 12 days. These data 
confirm direct human-to-human transmission of the 
COVID-19 virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome 
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), through close contact 
(21). This finding supports the government restric￾tion of persons gathering in large groups, to reduce 
or minimize virus transmission. The 95% percentile 
range for the incubation period found in our study is 
consistent with the findings for Wuhan, which almost 
completely overlap (13), suggesting that within this 
short time, SARS-CoV-2 has not mutated sufficiently 
to affect incubation time (22). 
The proportion of persons who visited a medi￾cal center or hospital within 2 days from illness on￾set was 61% in Gansu Province, compared with 27%

COVID-19 in Gansu Province, China, 2020
in Wuhan (13). In addition, 68% of patients in Gansu 
Province were hospitalized within 5 days after illness 
onset, whereas only 11% of patients in Wuhan were 
hospitalized in the early stages of the disease (13). 
These differences between Gansu Province and Wu￾han may partially result from differences in numbers 
of staff and medical resources between Wuhan and 
Gansu Province, relative to the number of COVID-19 
patients. Another potential factor is advanced warn￾ing about COVID-19 in Gansu Province via various 
channels. Although knowledge about COVID-19 was 
minimal at the beginning of the outbreak, the seri￾ousness of COVID-19 was well broadcast through￾out China, including Gansu Province, after the initial 
outbreak. Compared with the initial stage of the CO￾VID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, the reduced incidence of 
COVID-19 in Gansu Province over this period may be 
associated with reinforcement of mandatory control 
and prevention interventions, patients voluntarily 
seeking medical assistance after being educated by 
the media, or possibly both.
Our study demonstrates a significant spatial het￾erogeneity of COVID-19 cases in Gansu Province over 
this 2-week period; cases were mostly concentrated in 
Lanzhou and surrounding areas. LISA analysis find￾ings are in agreement with the spatial distribution of 
COVID-19 at the county levels of Gansu Province. 
This analysis confirms that the distribution of cases 
was not random: hot spots were mainly restricted to 
the Chengguan District of Lanzhou, the most densely 
populated and most developed area (11). This case ag￾gregation is closely associated with the development 
characteristics of Gansu Province, which is at the high 
end of economic, medical, population, and cultural 
development. Consequently, Chengguan District was 
the most common pathway for most persons return￾ing from Wuhan and other cities, who end up in or 
transit through Lanzhou. Land formations in Gansu 
Province limit travel, particularly in mountainous ru￾ral areas, which may have slowed down or restricted 
the spread of COVID-19 across Gansu Province. For 
example, cases have been reported in Wuwei, a city in 
a remote, mountainous, hard-to-reach area in Gansu 
Province. Our findings are supported by other stud￾ies, which demonstrate a close correlation with pop￾ulation and economy in other major cities of China 
where outbreaks of COVID-19 occurred within 1–2 
weeks of the original outbreak in Wuhan (23–25).
Although case numbers are small, in Gansu 
Province the severity of COVID-19 illness did not 
differ between persons with primary and second￾ary cases, suggesting that the virus does not mutate 
to decrease virulence during ongoing transmis￾sion. This finding is consistent with recent reports 
from Italy and the United States, which suggest that 
mutations that reduce transmission do not spon￾taneously develop in SARS-CoV-2 (2,3). In Gansu 
Province, we observed fewer severe clinical cases of 
COVID-19, lower rates of patients in critical condi￾tion (13%), and no deaths, compared with Wuhan, 
where ≈30% patients were admitted to intensive care 
and 4% died (26). One possible explanation is insuf￾ficient medical staff and resources in Wuhan to deal 
with the large outbreak and only extremely serious

or critical patients being hospitalized, in contrast 
to Gansu Province, where relatively more medical 
staff and resources were available. Furthermore, a 
large proportion of the Wuhan population who left 
the city before the lockdown were migrant work￾ers, commercial personnel, and college students; the 
population remaining in Wuhan after the lockdown 
therefore comprised mostly elderly persons with 
compromised immunity (27). The incubation period 
in Gansu Province was longer than that in Wuhan 
(3–6 days for Wuhan) (28,29). This finding may be 
the result of the government’s intensive provision of 
information for the whole nation about controlling 
and preventing COVID-19.
A limitation of our study is the difficulty of cal￾culating county-level incidence or estimating the risk 
factors affecting SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Gansu 
Province because of the relatively small number of 
cases and the short study period (i.e., 12 days), which 
may not reflect the entire epidemiology of the virus in 
Gansu Province and will only become clear over time. 
Whether the outbreak will be controlled soon, and if 
so when, will be answered in due course.
In conclusion, our study demonstrates the epi￾demiology of a relatively small-scale outbreak of 
COVID-19 outside of Wuhan. Our cohort included 
primary cases from Wuhan and subsequent sec￾ondary cases, including several family clusters. 
Such information should be useful for other regions 
and countries to help combat the spread of this le￾thal disease (30) by informing the development of 
more effective local infection control policies and 
recommendations.
