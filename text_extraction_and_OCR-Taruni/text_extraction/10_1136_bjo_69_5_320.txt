SUMMARY Three patients with acute lymphatic leukaemia developed visual impairment due to
occlusion of small retinal vessels with multiple cotton wool spots after treatment which included
whole body and skull irradiation followed by bone marrow transplantation and cyclosporin A.
Withdrawal of cyclosporin A and treatment with corticosteroids was followed by recovery of visual
acuity. This retinopathy and the retinal changes seen in the immunodeficiency syndrome are
thought to be closely related. The possible role of cyclosporin A is discussed, though cotton wool
spots and retinal haemorrhages have never been described in renal transplant patients during
treatment with this drug. Withdrawal of cyclosporin A, which is highly effective in preventing graft￾versus-host disease, can be fatal. Irradiation of the skull prior to bone marrow transplantation and
intrathecal administration of methotrexate may be the most important factors causing the retinal
ischaemic signs described here. The inclusion of an ophthalmologist in the team monitoring.
transplant patients would lead to increased documentation and a better understanding of this
disease.
We have recently seen three patients who developed
severe visual loss two to three months after bone
marrow transplantation. The ophthalmoscopic sub￾strate of this visual loss was a disseminated multifocal
ischaemic retinopathy with extensive cotton wool
patches and retinal haemorrhages. All three patients
had received irradiation to the head in addition to
whole body irradiation and had been treated with
cyclosporin A to prevent graft-versus-host disease.
The heavy maintenance immunosuppression which
patients with bone marrow grafts receive suggests a
possible connection between this retinopathy and
that observed in the 'immunodeficiency syndrome.'
However, to the best of our knowledge multifocal
ischaemia of the retina with multiple cotton wool
spots has not yet been reported as a complication of
bone marrow transplantation.
The question therefore arises whether cyclosporin

A was directly or indirectly involved in the disease
process. These three cases described here may also
help us to understand what is going on in the retina in
the immunodeficiency syndrome.

A female, born on 29 March 1961.
Primary disease. Acute lymphatic leukaemia, Calla
positive, diagnosed in October 1981. Induction
therapy: vincristine, prednisone, daunorubicin, L￾asparaginase. Complete remission in November
1981. In November and December irradiation of the
skull with 2400 rads, combined with methotrexate,
mercaptopurine, vincristine, and prednisone.
Bone marrow transplantation was performed on 9
March 1982 after treatment with cyclophosphamide
60 mg/kg body weight, two doses, and following
irradiation of the whole body with 1000 rads. To
prevent graft-versus-host disease cyclosporin A was
given at a dose of 20 mg/kg body weight the day

before, 10 mg/kg on the day of transplantation, then 5
mg/kg for 11 days, 600 mg by mouth for four weeks,
later reduced to 450 mg per day. The dose of
cyclosporin A was reduced when the serum creati￾nine increased slightly and oedema of the face
developed.
Eye disease. A complete eye examination per￾formed on 26 February 1982 prior to bone marrow
transplantation was normal. Three months after
bone marrow transplantation the patient noted hazy
vision in the right eye. A subsequent eye examination
on 6 September 1982, three months after bone
marrow transplantation, showed the following:
Visual acuity RE 0-7-0-8 partially unaided, LE
0-8-1*0 partially unaided. With the Amsler grid a
paracentral scotoma below was shown on the right
side; the left eye was normal. Pupil reactions were
normal. Round the disc and the macula multiple
typical cotton wool spots and some haemorrhages in
the nerve fibre layer were found. No sheathing of
vessels and no cells in the vitreous could be found.
The patient's general health at this time was good.
Blood pressure measurements were always normal
apart from a single reading of 160/90 mmHg in
February 1982. Hb 10-1 g/dl, leucocytes 2-6x109/l,
normal differential count, thrombocytes 168x109/l.
There was no evidence of platelet dysfunction at this
stage. Two and a half weeks later her visual acuity
decreased over the course of a few days and on 29
June was RE 0-05, LE 0-2-03. Amsler grid: patchy
central scotoma on the right and a large scotoma
below fixation on the left. Fundus examination
showed a great increase in the number of cotton wool
spots, which were becoming confluent (Figs. la, b),
and more intraretinal haemorrhages were evident.
The arterioles were narrow, the veins dilated. Gold￾mann fields showed: paracentral scotoma in both
eyes for I2, 13, and 4. Therapy with cyclosporin A was
stopped, and prednisone 100 mg/day was given for 14
days, then in lower doses. In the following weeks the
cotton wool patches regressed slowly and the scoto￾mas in the Amsler grid disappeared, though fine
retinal folds and some hard exudates were still visible
at the right posterior pole. Six weeks after the patient
started treatment with steroids her visual acuity RE
was 07, LE 0 9 (Figs. 2a, b).
Follow-up. The patient remained well until the end
of January 1983, when paraesthesiae developed in
the left arm. On 3 February the patient was admitted
to hospital after the onset of a left temporal sensory
hemisyndrome 1 to 2 days previously. Neither a CT
scan nor an electroencephalogram (EEG) showed
any definite abnormality. A sensory Jacksonian-type
epilepsy was suspected. Vascular disease, such as a
cortical vein thrombosis, and leukaemic infiltration
were considered as possible causes.

CASE 2
A male born on 11 March 1962.
Primary disease. Acute lymphatic leukaemia,
Calla positive, was diagnosed in April 1981. Riehm's
induction therapy with vincristine, prednisone,
daunorubicin, L-asparaginase, cyclophosphamide,
mercaptopurine, and cytarabine was given. In May
1981 irradiation of the skull with 2400 rads was
performed. Methotrexate was given intrathecally.
Despite maintenance therapy with methotrexate and
mercaptopurine the patient relapsed in September
1981. Again induction with vincristine, prednisone,
and doxorubicin (Adriamycin) was followed by
maintenance therapy with doxorubicin, vincristine
and cyclophosphamide. After treatment with cyclo￾phosphamide 60 mg/kg body weight for two days
whole body irradiation with 1000 rads and bone
marrow transplantation were performed on 27
February 1982. To prevent graft-versus-host disease
cyclosporin A at a dose of 20 mg/kg body weight was
given the day before transplantation, 10 mg/kg on the
day of transplantation, and for four days thereafter,
followed by 5 mg/kg for three days, then a reduction
to 200 mg/day. From the 41st day 800 mg/day was
given orally.
Eye disease. An eye examination was performed
on 15 April 1982 prior to bone marrow transplanta￾tion. Visual acuity was RE 1-0-1-2, LE 1-0-1*2;
fundus RE normal, LE small round haemorrhages in
the region of the inferotemporal vascular arcade.
Eight days after bone marrow transplantation the
patient noted a brief disturbance of accommodation.
Because he complained of visual loss, another eye
examination was performed on 5 August 1982. Visual
acuity was then RE 1.0, LE 0-1. In the RE fine
haemorrhages at the margin of the disc and cotton
wool spots were noted, but the macula was normal.
In the LE the optic disc was normal, but haem￾orrhages and cotton wool patches were seen else￾where. There was no evidence of platelet dysfunction
at this stage. Cyclosporin A therapy was stopped,
prednisone 100 mg/day was begun and continued for
14 days. Two weeks after the patient started treat￾ment with prednisone his visual acuity LE was again
0-5, RE unchanged at 1.2. The Amsler grid revealed
a definite scotoma, which regressed over the next two
weeks. On 23 August 1982 the visual acuity was RE
1-0, LE 0-9.
Follow-up. On 25 August the patient suffered a
further relapse and died on 2 November 1982.
CASE 3
A male, born on 30 April 1962.
Primary disease. Acute lymphatic leukaemia,
Calla positive, was diagnosed in October 1981.
Riehm's induction therapy was started with vincris￾tine, prednisone, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide,
L-asparaginase, methotrexate, and cytarabine. In
December 1981 irradiation of the skull was perfor￾med with 2000 rads and methotrexate was given
intrathecally four times. After treatment with cyclo￾phosphamide 60 mg/kg twice, whole body irradiation

Multiple cotton wool spotsfollowing bone marrow transplantation
with 1000 rads and bone marrow transplantation
were performed on 17 September 1981. To prevent
graft-versus-host disease cyclosporin A was given 20
mg/kg body weight the day before transplantation,
then 10 mg/kg for four days starting on the day of
transplantation, then 5 mg/kg for 14 days, 700 mg/day
orally.
Eye disease. An eye examination 11 days before
bone marrow transplantation showed normal find￾ings. The visual acuity was RE 1*0, LE 1-0 unaided.
On 9 December the patient noted visual disturbance
and examination revealed a visual acuity of RE 0-4,
LE 0-1. Large cotton wool spots and haemorrhages
were seen in the fundus of both eyes. One day later
both eyes showed multiple cotton wool spots, small
haemorrhages, and a Cellophane maculopathy,
while in the LE the retina above the papillomacular
bundle was oedematous and swollen, giving the
appearance of a branch arterial occlusion. In the
macula a small serous detachment had appeared.
Visual field examination on 13 January showed a
field defect corresponding to this lesion. There was
no evidence of platelet dysfunction at this stage.
Follow-up. Cyclosporin A was stopped and predni￾sone 100 mg/day was given. After 14 days the dosage
was reduced. The visual acuity was RE 0*8, LE 0-8.
Clinically the patient was well and the bone marrow
showed a full remission. Later he developed
bronchopneumonia and fibrosing alveolitis (prolif￾erative stage) and died on 10 February 1983. The
necropsy showed no signs of a relapse of the acute
leukaemia and no obstructive disease of the vessels in
the kidney.
Eye at necropsy. A few fine cotton wool spots were
visible in the parapapillary region of the right globe.
Histology revealed the presence of cytoid bodies in
both eyes (Fig. 3), thus confirming unequivocally the
clinical diagnosis of cotton wool spots. Step-serial
sections did not show any abnormality of the blood
vessels supplying the areas of retina containing
cotton wool spots, nor was there any evidence of
retinal inflammation or infection.
Discussion
The cotton wool spots seen in our patients may be
regarded as an expression of small vessel disease, the
site of obstruction being at small arterioles, precapil￾laries, and/or in the capillary bed.
This clinical picture of bilateral cotton wool spots
and retinal haemorrhages must be distinguished from
the fundus appearance of partial central retinal artery
occlusion. ' The latter condition, which affected only
one eye in each of the seven patients described,' is
characterised by multiple peripapillary cotton wool
spots and mild ischaemic swelling of the inner retina
but almost complete absence of retinal haemor￾rhages. Furthermore all patients were suffering
from either temporal arteritis, severe hypertension,
or embolism.
The multifocal ischaemia of the retina which we
describe here could have been caused by any one of a

large number of conditions, including iatrogenic
factors, infections, immunological or haematological
disorders, or vascular disease. However, the most
probable causes are acquired immunodeficiency,
radiation combined with intrathecal methotrexate,
or the administration of cyclosporin A. Viral infec￾tions such as cytomegalovirus or herpes simplex,
graft-versus-host disease, anaemia, hypertension,
and platelet deposition represent less likely causes.
If disseminated retinal ischaemia severe enough to
produce visual loss, as in our patients, was caused
solely by the immunosuppressives commonly
employed in bone marrow transplantation, one
would have expected other investigators to have
reported this complication, since around 1000
marrow transplants have now been performed.
Clearly we must seek other causes, such as radiation
and/or cyclosporin A. It is possible that irradiation of
the skull with subsequent irradiation of the whole
body and the intrathecal administration of metho￾trexate may predispose to retinal vascular damage.
The eye disease would then have its counterpart in
the brain: that is, multifocal leucoencephalopathy,
which, in contrast to the eye disease, is a known
complication in patients given the pretransplantation
treatment employed here. The sensory Jacksonian￾type epilepsy in our first patient provides some
support for this view, although the ocular vessels at
this stage no longer showed any evidence of vascular
obstruction either in the arterioles, capillaries, or
veins. Nevertheless, in none of our three patients
does the retinal disease resemble the classical picture
of radiation retinopathy, which in addition to cotton
wool spots shows sheathing and obliteration of
vessels, microaneurysms, neovascularisation, and
hard exudates.2 Furthermore, radiation retinopathy
is usually progressive and does not respond to
therapy.
The question whether cyclosporin A was directly
or indirectly responsible for the retinal changes seen
in our three patients must be seriously considered for
two reasons. Firstly, although visual symptoms did
not occur until some 6-16 months after the diagnosis
of leukaemia and irradiation of the skull, the interval
between whole body irradiation, bone marrow trans￾plantation, and administration of cyclosporin A and
the onset of visual symptoms was only 2-31/2 months
(Table 1.) Secondly, the most important action of
cyclosporin A is suppression of T-helper lympho￾cytes,34 thus producing a situation very similar to that
seen in patients with the immunodeficiency syn￾drome,5 6 So long as the picture is not complicated by
retinal infection, usually due to cytomegalovirus or
Pneumocystis carinii. Pepose et al.7 stressed that
microvascular and infectious diseases of the retina
must not be confused with each other. This is
clinically important, because retinal changes due to
microvascular disease may respond to steroid
therapy, whereas if an infection is also present
steroids may lead to disaster, at least if given on their
own. In one of our three cases we could demonstrate
the presence of typical cotton wool spots histologic￾ally, with no evidence of an infectious disease.
But patients with collagen diseases such as lupus
erythematosus, dermatomyositis, and scleroderma
may also present a similar clinical picture. In derma￾tomyositis the number of cotton wool spots often
exceeds what would be expected from the level of
arterial hypertension seen in these patients. All these
conditions are autoimmune diseases in which anti￾nuclear antibodies are found and in which the T￾helper cells may be suppressed as by cyclosporin A.
Cyclosporin A does not suppress secondary
responses. It has no cytotoxic effect and does not
lower resistance to bacterial or fungal infections.3 4 It
is most effective in the treatment of graft-versus-host
disease, being literally life-saving for many patients,
so that extreme caution is indicated before cyclo￾sporin A is implicated as the cause of the retinopathy
described here.
It is interesting that we could not find similar
retinal changes in 14 renal transplant patients who had
received cyclosporin A for 12 months (Oechslin A,
Thiel G, Gloor B, personal observations to be
published) even though one might expect such
changes in patients with kidney disease. On the other
hand one of the authors together with Mihatsch
(Daicker B, Mihatsch MJ, unpublished observa￾tions) has recently found histologically ischaemic
optic neuropathies with atrophy of the inner retinal
layers in young, healthy rats treated with cyclosporin
A. These findings suggest a direct effect of cyclo￾sporin A on small vessels of the retina and/or optic
nerve.

Multiple cotton woolspots following bone marrow transplantation
Unfortunately cyclosporin A was stopped in each
of our cases as soon as retinopathy was recognised.
We cannot therefore say whether these cases
responded to steroids, which were started only when
cyclosporin A therapy was stopped. However, it is
important to note that the disease process in the
retina was reversible. The lack of inflammation in the
anterior segment and the complete absence of cells in
the vitreous virtually exclude most viral infections.
No foci of retinal necrosis, characteristic of cyto￾megalovirus infection, were seen, neither did the
typical pale chorioretinal scars develop subsequently.
The most important ocular complication of graft￾versus-host disease affects the anterior segment,'10
where a condition resembling Sjogren's disease was
first described by Gratwohl et al."1 None of our
patients complained of dry eyes. Retinal changes
suggesting microvascular disease have not been
described in patients with graft-versus-host disease,
and the occurrence of haemorrhages in the retina and
vitreous probably reflects pancytopenia.'2 '3
Our patients were not anaemic and suffered
neither from extreme arterial hypertension nor from
hypotension. In none of the three patients was there
any evidence that platelet deposition was occurring
elsewhere in the body during the period over which
the cotton wool spots developed. Nor were any signs
of a coagulopathy detected suggesting that platelet
dysfunction was not responsible for the retinal
changes observed.
In conclusion, the cause of the multifocal retinal
ischaemic disease in our three patients remains
obscure. It is clearly desirable that all patients
submitted to bone marrow transplantation should be
examined by an ophthalmologist whether or not they
are receiving cyclosporin A. A careful study of renal
transplant patients should also be undertaken in an
attempt to elucidate any connection between cyclo￾sporin A and the development of retinopathy.
