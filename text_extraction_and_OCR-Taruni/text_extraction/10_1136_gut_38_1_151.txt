Abstract
The first case of amyloidosis is reported in
which spontaneous massive hepatic
haemorrhage necessitated emergency
liver transplantation. Liver transplanta￾tion, as a treatment for a failing liver due
to amyloidosis has not been previously
reported. At transplantation, the liver
tissue was uncharacteristically friable,
although the subsequent vascular and
biliary anastomoses were uncomplicated.
Histological examination of the liver
showed a surprisingly modest amount of
amyloid, which was shown immunohisto￾chemically to be derived from lysozyme,
and a striking absence of reticulin stain￾ing. Both the patient's father and paternal
grandfather had died from spontaneous
hepatic haemorrhage, and histological
review of their liver tissue showed simi￾larly modest deposition of lysozyme￾derived amyloid associated with loss of
reticulin staining. In each case the quan￾tity of amyloid was far less than would be
expected to interfere with the mechanical
integrity of the liver. This is the only
report ofhepatic disintegration associated
with absence ofreticulin staining, and it is
probable that the mechanism represents a
novel secondary effect of the amyloid
deposits in the livers of this family.

Case report
A 15 year old male presented with a two day
history of worsening upper abdominal pain,
referred to the shoulder tip. At the age of 13, a
diagnosis of amyloidosis had been made on
rectal biopsy. On admission he was in shock,
and underwent emergency laparotomy. The
operative findings were those of a large bleed
into the abdominal cavity and a large subcap￾sular haematoma over the upper aspect of the
whole liver. The clot was evacuated and the
liver packed. He was transferred to a specialist
hepatobiliary unit after 24 hours of intensive
care, but soon required another laparotomy for
evacuation of a further blood clot, packing,
and spraying of the involved area with fibrin
glue. Liver function deteriorated, however,
necessitating emergency liver transplantation.
At transplantation the liver was noted to be
remarkably fragile such that it was 'falling
apart'. At six months post-transplant the
patient is well, and there have been no anasto￾motic problems.
The patient's father underwent investigation
for multiple hepatic bleeds requiring laparo￾tomy for evacuation ofhepatic haematoma and
repeated transfusions. No coagulation defect
was found, but there was prolonged bleeding
time, and liver and rectal biopsy specimens
showed amyloidosis. Coeliac arteriography
and hepatic scans showed filling defects and
calcification in the liver. At the age of 35, in
view of repeated bleeding, he underwent
hepatic artery ligation, but intraoperative
bleeding was uncontrollable and he died soon
after.
At the age of 50, the paternal grandfather
died shortly after uncontrollable hepatic
haemorrhage during portocaval anastomosis
for portal hypertension. At operation there was
a fistula between the portal vein and the
common bile duct. There was a 10 year history
of hepatic dysfunction, haematemesis, and
portal hypertension.
Pathologicalfindings
The patient's explanted liver weighed 1800 g.
It was remarkably friable with a crumbly
texture and golden-yellow appearance; it
resembled necrotic tissue. There was extensive
haemorrhage into the parenchyma. Micro￾scopically, portal tracts contained amorphous
deposits of hyaline material (Fig 1), confirmed
to be amyloid by Congo red staining. Minor
amyloid deposits were seen in the space of
Disse and in the walls of medium sized blood
vessels (arteries and veins). Immuno￾histochemical studies were performed using a
panel of antibodies against amyloid fibril
proteins (AA amyloid, K and X light chains),
which were negative. A specific positive reac￾tion was obtained with rabbit antilysozyme
antibody (Dako) showing that lysozyme was a
major constituent of the amyloid. Staining for
reticulin using the Gordon Sweets method

showed that the normal reticulin framework
was absent in large areas of the liver.
A few
areas still retained residual reticulin fibres
(Fig 2). Overlaying of slides showed that the
presence of amyloid corresponded to the
absence of reticulin staining. Immuno￾histochemical staining for collagen subtypes I,
III, IV, and
V showed that type IV collagen was
still present beneath the amyloid deposits.
Extensive centrilobular zonal necrosis was
present reflecting ischaemic damage due to
hypoperfusion. Amyloid was also seen in
a
portal lymph node, but not in
a renal biopsy
specimen taken during assessment of renal
function around the time of transplantation.
At necropsy, the father's liver was large
(3420 g) and contained fresh and partially
organised haematomas; the parenchyma was
a
golden-brown colour. The spleen was also
enlarged at 750 g. Histological examination of
the liver showed irregular fibrous scarring, pre￾sumably a reflection of previous bleeds. There
were areas ofhaemorrhage and necrosis. Portal
tracts, and to
a lesser extent sinusoids, were
infiltrated by lysozyme amyloid. There was
loss of reticulin staining around liver cell
plates. In other tissues, widespread deposition
of amyloid was seen in the walls of blood
vessels; globular deposits of amyloid were seen
in lymph nodes but not in the kidneys or heart.
At necropsy, the grandfather's liver was
described as 'pultaceous', large (2430 g), and
diffusely yellow and necrotic in appearance.
Review of the histological findings showed
extensive centrilobular zonal necrosis and
deposition of lysozyme amyloid in portal
tracts.
A pattern of reticulin loss similar to that
seen in the son's and grandson's liver was seen;
amyloid was also present in the spleen.
Discussion
We report the first case of massive hepatic
haemorrhage due to hereditary systemic amy￾loidosis necessitating liver transplantation.
Liver transplantation has previously only been
used as
a surgical form of 'gene therapy' in
patients with familial amyloid polyneuropathy
in whom the amyloid fibril precursor protein is
exclusively produced in this organ.1 In our
patient, liver transplantation is palliative as
lysozyme is synthesised by macrophages
throughout the body and it is therefore
probable that hepatic amyloid deposition will
recur in the transplanted organ. The identifica￾tion of lysozyme as the amyloid fibril protein,
together with the autosomal dominant inheri￾tance, strongly suggest that a variant form of
lysozyme, due to
a mutation in the lysozyme
gene is responsible for the disease in this
family. DNA studies are in progress, and will
be the subject of another report.
Only two families with hereditary lysozyme￾associated amyloidosis have been described,
and in neither was reticulin staining or hepatic
haemorrhage
a feature despite the fact that
several of these patients had massive hepatic
amyloid deposits.2 Haemorrhage is
a recog￾nised, though rare complication in hepatic
amyloid, mainly following biopsy when the
liver can fracture.3 Typically in such cases, the
liver is waxy and rigid.4 In contrast, the striking
feature of the liver in this report was its fragility
and crumbly consistency. Clinical records
point to
a similar hepatic appearance in the two
other patients in this family. In the liver, type
IV collagen is
a major component of 'reticulin'
on which the liver cell plates rest, and it main￾tains sinusoidal integrity.5
Histologically the loss of reticulin staining
coincided with amyloid deposition in the sinu￾soids, suggesting a direct relation between the
two. It has been suggested that lysozyme can
digest the reticulin framework of the liver6 but
these findings could not be confirmed in more
recent work (T Krausz and
M
B Pepys, personal
communication). The maintenance of staining
for type IV collagen implies that it is still present
beneath the amyloid, but that it is not staining
with the silver stain for reticulin. Nevertheless,
these findings suggest an unusual mechanism
for the hepatic bleeding, and we speculate that
the loss of reticulin staining,
a common factor
among the three cases is associated with the
liver fragility. It seems that amyloid deposition
can, at least in some circumstances, exert
important secondary effects on the mechanical
integrity of the liver. We believe that this is the
first report in which reticulin staining has disap￾peared from the liver. 1 Steen L, Holmgren G, Suhr 0, Wikstrom L, Groth C-G,
