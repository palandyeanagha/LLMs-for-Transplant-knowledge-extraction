Does Mycobacterium avium subspecies
paratuberculosis cause Crohn’s
disease?

Reassessing this persistent theory in light of advances in molecular
microbial detection and genetic pathogenesis of disease
S
imilarities between chronic idio￾pathic granulomatous ileocolitis
and mycobacterial infections have
been noted since the original descrip￾tions of the clinical syndrome now
called Crohn’s disease.1–4 Interest in a
possible infectious origin of this disorder
was renewed in 1989 when Chiodini
et al cultured apparently identical
Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratu￾berculosis (MAP) from three patients
with Crohn’s disease.5 This controversy
increased in intensity following the
detection of the specific DNA insertion
sequence, IS900, of MAP in relatively
high numbers of patients with Crohn’s
disease relative to ulcerative colitis and
normal controls,6 and is now raging as
several different groups have detected
this organism in the food chain7 and
water supply,8 proposed maternal-fetal
transmission in human milk,9 reported
long term responses to antimycobacter￾ial antibiotic combinations,10 and even
cultured viable M paratuberculosis in
blood samples of Crohn’s disease
patients.11
Additional data to support an associa￾tion of MAP with Crohn’s disease is
provided by Autschbach and collea￾gues12 in this issue of Gut (see page
944). This carefully performed and well
controlled study used nested polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) to detect the IS900
insertion element of MAP in 52% of
Crohn’s disease resected tissues versus
2% of ulcerative colitis and 5% of mostly
non-inflammatory control tissues. This
study provides novel data regarding the
prevalence of MAP in various pheno￾types of Crohn’s disease by showing
slightly higher detection of IS900 DNA
in colonic (66.7%) compared with distal
ileal (40.5%) tissues and decreased
detection rates with corticosteroid use.
In addition, these authors reported
weak associations with perianal involve￾ment and a shorter duration of disease
but no correlation with patient sex, age
at diagnosis, stricturing versus penetrat￾ing phenotype, or presence of granulo￾mas.
Data from this study help address
some of the controversies that have
fuelled the vigorous debate between
committed advocates and confirmed
sceptics that is receiving increasing
attention in the scientific literature, lay
press, and internet chat rooms. The
arguments in favour or opposed to this
theory (table 1) have some merit but
many are flawed by incomplete data and
lack of rigorous reflection. There is no
doubt that a potential source of zoonotic
infection exists, with widespread MAP
infections in the dairy herds of Europe,
North America, and Australia,13 14 excre￾tion of MAP in milk from infected
cows,15 relative resistance of intracellu￾lar MAP to widely used pasteurisation
techniques,16 and recovery of viable
MAP from the water supplying Los
Angeles.8 Moreover, the vast majority
of studies using diverse techniques have
detected MAP DNA or cultured this
organism in higher frequency from
tissues of patients with Crohn’s disease
than from those with ulcerative colitis
and other disorders, although the
reported frequency of recovery in both
Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis
have ranged from 0% to 100%.17 These
results are consistent with two possibil￾ities: either MAP infection could cause
Crohn’s disease in a subset of patients
that are either selectively exposed to this
organism or who are genetically suscep￾tible to infection or, alternatively, this
relatively common dietary organism
may selectively colonise (or a dead
organism selectively lodge in) the ulcer￾ated mucosa of Crohn’s disease patients
but not initiate or perpetuate intestinal
inflammation. Molecular fingerprints
show that genotypes of bovine and
human isolates are not similar but
instead indicate that human and ovine
(sheep) strains are more closely
related.18 Maternal/fetal transmission of
MAP has been proposed following cul￾ture of MAP from breast milk of two
patients with Crohn’s disease.9
However, the frequency of positive
cultures in human milk is uncertain,
this observation has not been replicated
by other investigators, and there is no
evidence of increased frequency of
Crohn’s disease in the offspring of
mothers versus fathers with Crohn’s
disease. Even if transmission of viable
MAP occurs, a plausible mechanism of
tissue injury and induction of chronic
intestinal inflammation has not been
proposed. Even advocates of the theory
that MAP causes Crohn’s disease con￾cede that infection, if present, consists
of a low bacterial load and that no
histochemical evidence of acid fast
staining in Crohn’s disease tissues is
seen. This could be explained by a
paucibacillary infection with an obligate
intracellular, cell wall deficient bacterial
form.19 In this setting, inflammation
and tissue injury must be mediated by
a cell mediated immune response.
However, a cellular immune response
to MAP has not been documented in
Crohn’s disease patients,20 despite
increased serological responses to MAP
antigens in the same patients. Another
serious flaw in the MAP pathogenesis of
Crohn’s disease theory is the observa￾tion that these patients respond to
chronic immunosuppressive therapies21
and acquired immunosuppressive infec￾tions decrease disease activity as CD4 T
cell counts fall.22 In contrast, M tubercu￾losis massively proliferates with anti￾tumour necrosis factor or steroid treat￾ment and M avium intracellulare thrives
in the intestine as CD4 counts fall in
human immunodeficiency virus
infected patients. It is possible that
intracellular cell wall deficient MAP
may not replicate well despite immuno￾suppression, but this issue has never
been studied by in vitro investigation or
in animals with Johne’s disease. In the
study by Autschbach et al, corticosteroid
therapy was associated with lower MAP
detection rates.12
The most irrefutable evidence that a
microbial agent causes a disease is long
term remission of clinical manifesta￾tions and an altered natural history of
disease following clearance of the infec￾tion. In vitro sensitivity analyses show
that clinical isolates of MAP are not
responsive to traditional anti-M tubercu￾losis agents, and therefore lack of effi￾cacy with isoniazid, ethambutol, and
rifampicin treatment for two years with
a three year follow up23 does not detract
from this theory. However, reports of
efficacy of combinations of clarithromy￾cin or azithromycin, rifabutin, and a
variety of other agents in 58–82% of
Crohn’s disease patients10 24 are also not
definitive due to the uncontrolled nat￾ure of these studies, the small number
of patients treated, the variable treat￾ment regimens, and the fact that these
antibiotics, particularly clarithromycin,

have a broad spectrum of activity
against commensal enteric bacteria.
Moreover, these studies and a yet to be
published ongoing controlled trial in
Australia using these agents in Crohn’s
disease patients are flawed by not
assessing IS900 DNA in biopsy speci￾mens by PCR and serological responses
to MAP before and after therapy, so that
clinical results can be correlated with
the presence of tissue MAP and its
clearance with treatment. Selective
responses in those patients with detec￾tible MAP colonisation that clear infec￾tion with antibiotic treatment would
strongly imply a causal relationship of
the infection.
Our evolving molecular understand￾ing of gene/environmental interactions
offers an opportunity to reassess the
MAP causation theory of Crohn’s dis￾ease in a new light. NOD2/CARD15 is an
intracellular receptor for muramyl
dipeptide (MDP), the smallest immuno￾logically active component of bacterial
peptidoglycan. Ligation of MDP by
NOD2/CARD15 activates nuclear factor
kB. This pathway may contribute to
clearance of intracellular bacterial infec￾tion25 and secretion of a defensins by
Paneth cells, which constitutively
express NOD2/CARD15.26 The three
most common polymorphisms of this
gene are found in 25–35% of Caucasian
Crohn’s disease patients27 and lead to
defective nuclear factor kB activation by
MDP.28 29 Expression of the common
truncation mutation of NOD2/CARD15
is associated with defective clearance of
invasive salmonella infection in epithe￾lial cells.25 In addition, NOD2/CARD15
mutations in Crohn’s disease are asso￾ciated with diminished mucosal a
defensin expression.30 Thus an attractive
explanation linking NOD2/CARD15 to
Crohn’s disease is that defective func￾tion of this gene results in ineffective
clearance of intracellular MAP infection
and in decreased luminal a defensin
secretion that permits increased muco￾sal adherence and epithelial invasion of
ingested organisms. Defective clearance
of intracellular MAP by innate immune
cells, including macrophages, could
explain the seemingly paradoxical ther￾apeutic response of some Crohn’s
disease patients to granulocyte-macro￾phage colony stimulating factor.31
However, the phenotypic information
provided by Autschbach and collea￾gues12 argues against an association of
NOD2/CARD15 with MAP infection, as
MAP was more commonly detected in
colonic than ileal disease and was not
more frequently found in early onset or
stricturing disease.12 Likewise, patients
with extensive ileocolitis responded bet￾ter to macrolide antibiotics and rifabu￾tin than did those with isolated ileal
disease.10 These results directly contrast
with the strong association of NOD2/
CARD15 polymorphisms with early
onset ileal Crohn’s disease with a
stricturing phenotype.32
Crohn’s disease certainly has environ￾mental and host genetic influences that
interact to cause clinically evident dis￾ease. It is equally clear that MAP is
widely present in our food chain and
that the DNA of this organism can be
recovered from the intestine of Crohn’s
disease patients. Although existing data
do not compellingly implicate MAP as a
causal agent in Crohn’s disease, neither
do they definitively exclude this possi￾bility. We must determine whether MAP
infection causes human disease, which
is unlikely in my opinion, or whether
this environmental contaminant inno￾cently lodges in ulcerated mucosa. Is
MAP analogous to Helicobacter pylori in
peptic ulcer disease, gastritis, and gastric
cancer, where host genetics and micro￾bial virulence factors determine
immune responses that mediate clinical
disease in a small minority of patients
exposed to a widespread infectious
agent? Are we repeating the mistake of
H pylori where the scientific establish￾ment resisted a new theory that chal￾lenged established paradigms of peptic
ulcer disease until overwhelming clin￾ical evidence made such resistance
untenable? Well designed clinical,
microbiological, and mechanistic experi￾ments are urgently needed to defini￾tively settle this still unresolved debate.
To establish a causal relationship
between MAP and Crohn’s disease, we
need to determine if clearance of MAP
selectively changes the natural history
of disease in an infected subset of
patients, perform definitive investiga￾tions of cellular immune responses to
this organism in Crohn’s disease and
control patients, determine if NOD2/
CARD15 and other microbial signalling
pathways influence intracellular MAP
infection and clearance, and review
results of ongoing large multi-institu￾tional studies to detect MAP in shared
coded tissues by various molecular and
culture methods. These studies need to
be designed and conducted by estab￾lished investigators who bring no pre￾determined biases to this contentious
topic. If MAP is responsible for a subset
of Crohn’s disease, public health mea￾sures must be implemented to eliminate
the source of infection in our food chain
and food processing practices must be
modified. In addition, the medical com￾munity must develop ways to efficiently
and cost effectively screen for MAP
infection and develop methods to effi￾ciently clear this organism from infected
tissues, possibly through a combination
of effective antibiotics and immuno￾stimulants that enhance innate clear￾ance responses. If there is no evidence of
a causal association of MAP and Crohn’s
disease, we need to direct resources to
other avenues of research. This contro￾versy has persisted far too long and
needs to be expeditiously resolved.

Probiotics and barrier function in colitis

Probiotic administration may exert a protective effect in colitis by
preventing mucosal barrier disruption and influencing the extent
of mucosal injury
T
here is strong evidence of a role for
the indigenous flora in driving
inflammatory responses in inflam￾matory bowel disease (IBD) in geneti￾cally predisposed individuals.1 For years,
researchers have tried in vain to identify
a specific pathogen as the cause of these
chronic intestinal inflammatory disor￾ders but the possibility that one or more
bacterial agents are responsible cannot
be ruled out. Considering the implica￾tions of a pathogen in IBD, as yet
undiscovered due to technical limita￾tions, it was hypothesised that modula￾tion of an abnormal microflora in these
patients by introducing high titres of
’’protective’’ bacteria might overwhelm
the ’’aggressive’’ strain(s) and inhibit its
deleterious effects. On this basis, pro￾biotic treatment was proposed as a
therapeutic approach.2
Probiotics are defined as ‘‘living
organisms which, on ingestion in cer￾tain numbers, exert health benefits
beyond inherent basic nutrition’’.3
Bacteria associated with probiotic activ￾ity are most commonly lactobacilli,
bifidobacteria, and streptococci but
other non-pathogenic bacteria such as
some strains of Escherichia coli and
microorganisms such as the yeast
Saccharomyces boulardii have been used
in IBD.
Encouraging results have been
obtained with probiotics in several
experimental animal models of IBD.4–7
In humans, probiotics are effective in
the prevention of pouchitis onset and
relapse.8–10 Results in ulcerative colitis
are promising, both in prevention of
relapse and treatment of mild to mod￾erate attacks.11–13 Results in Crohn’s
disease are not yet clear because of
conflicting data and the limited number
of well performed studies.14–16
Efforts are being made by many
researchers to unravel the precise
mechanisms by which probiotic bacteria
and their metabolic products (short
chain fatty acids, vitamins) exert their

beneficial effects. Several mechanisms
have been proposed to account for
probiotic action. These include: (a)
antagonistic activity against pathogenic
bacteria by competing for binding
sites17 18; (b) stimulation of mucosal
defence at the level of both immune
and epithelial function, by increasing
sIgA production,19 decreasing proin￾flammatory and increasing anti-inflam￾matory cytokine levels,20–26 and inducing
production of protective substances by
the epithelium, such as antimicrobial
peptides (bacteriocins) and hydrogen
peroxide, mucins,17 27 and heat shock
proteins,28 respectively; and (c) inhibi￾tion of bacterial translocation and rein￾forcement of barrier function20 21 by
mechanisms that have yet to be estab￾lished in detail.
The paper presented in this issue of
Gut29 describes the effect of modulation
of the microflora by Lactobacillus casei on
disease course and extent in the trini￾trobenzene sulphonic acid (TNBS)
model of experimental colitis (see page
955). The elegance of this study lies in
the experimental set up, which allowed
controlled mucosal colonisation with
indigenous flora and selected bacterial
strains after removal of the native flora
by antibiotics, and in the straightfor￾ward hypothesis and performance of the
study; TNBS exerted a direct toxic effect
on epithelial cells and disrupted the
intestinal barrier, and the effect of L
casei on impaired barrier function and
bacterial translocation in the TNBS
model was examined. Colonisation of
bacterial strains, measure of bacterial
translocation, neutrophil tissue influx,
and degree of inflammation were eval￾uated.
The data from this study suggest that
L casei administration exerts a protective
effect by preventing barrier disruption
by TNBS, as translocation of bacteria to
mesenteric lymph nodes was signifi￾cantly reduced in rats colonised with
standard rat flora and L casei compared
with rats colonised with only standard
rat flora. L casei intervention influenced
further extension of mucosal injury
induced by TNBS, but not the nature
of the colonic lesions (transmural
lesions were similar in depth compared
with TNBS colitis), and resulted in
lower myeloid peroxidase activity, a
measure of tissue neutrophil infiltra￾tion.
The exact mechanisms by which
probiotics can influence barrier function
remain to be elucidated. It is known
that certain lactobacilli adhere to muco￾sal surfaces, inhibit attachment of
pathogenic bacteria, and enhance secre￾tion of mucins.17 18 27 These properties
may be instrumental in improving
mucosal barrier function and decreasing
permeability to macromolecules and
toxins. Recently it has been shown that
a mixture of probiotic bacteria, in
addition to decreasing proinflammatory
cytokines—which increase intestinal
permeability (interferon c) and induce
a cascade of inflammatory events (inter￾leukin (IL)-1b, tumour necrosis factor a,
IL-8) resulting in mucosal injury by
invading immune cells (neutrophils,
tissue macrophages, dendritic cells20–26—
reinforce barrier function by secretion
of soluble factors that enhance barrier
integrity and by regulation of tight
junctions (TJ).20 21 TJ are dynamic
structures which represent the major
barrier within the paracellular pathway
and regulate in a rapid and coordinated
way paracellular permeability. Many
pathogenic bacteria modulate intestinal
permeability by alteration of TJ.30
Probiotics prevent Salmonella induced
alteration of the distribution of the TJ
protein zonula occludens 1 and
Salmonella induced enhanced permeabil￾ity by increasing transepithelial resis￾tance and decreasing mannitol flux.20 21
Maintenance of epithelial barrier
function is essential for the preservation
of mucosal integrity. Altered TJ struc￾ture in ulcerative colitis results in
impaired barrier function.31 Increased
permeability in IBD is observed during
the active phase of the disease and
therefore reinforcement of barrier func￾tion, together with their immune mod￾ulatory and metabolic properties, may
be central in the mechanism of action of
probiotic bacteria. Further investiga￾tions on how probiotics regulate the TJ
complex and influence intestinal perme￾ability are warranted.

Ulcerative colitis
.......................................................................................
Reinforcing the mucus: a new
therapeutic approach for ulcerative
colitis?
P R Gibson, J G Muir
...................................................................................
Luminal delivery of phosphatidyl rich phospholipids appears to
reduce mucosal inflammatory activity in a high proportion of
patients with chronically active ulcerative colitis. The simplicity and
apparent safety of this therapeutic approach offers new insights
into the importance of the mucus barrier in the pathogenesis and
treatment of ulcerative colitis
T
he treatment of active mucosal
inflammation in ulcerative colitis
remains challenging. Current thera￾pies have limited efficacy and may be
associated with clinically significant
adverse effects. There is room for new
therapeutic approaches. While nearly all
of our current pharmacological
approaches involve attacking various
immune and inflammatory pathways
in order to facilitate healing, few in the
clinician’s current arsenal are directed
towards enhancing or protecting the
colonic epithelial barrier. Is this situa￾tion about to change?
The understanding of the pathogen￾esis of ulcerative colitis has not con￾siderably progressed over the last
decade. The proponents of concepts that
the primary abnormalities lie within
immune and inflammatory mechanisms
have stumbled in attempts to explain
the striking features of ulcerative colitis,
such as the diffuse nature of the
inflammation, its confinement to the
mucosal compartment, and its distribu￾tion in the large bowel. The alternative
concept that primary abnormalities lie
within an abnormal epithelial barrier
sits more comfortably with these char￾acteristic features of the disease.1 The
barrier has regional differences in
structure, composition, and function,
which offer simple explanations for,
for example, disease distribution. The
nature of the inflammatory response in
ulcerative colitis—intense polymorph
infiltration and predominant antibody
mediated (TH2) responses with less
prominent T cell activation—is most
consistent with exposure of the immune
system to large numbers of different
‘‘foreign’’ molecules.2 Such events might
be anticipated in a situation where
multiple molecules are able to pass
through a deficient epithelial barrier.
This is in marked contrast with the
situation in Crohn’s disease where the
patchy inflammation involving deeper
layers of the intestinal wall and draining
lymph nodes, together with dominant T
cell activation and TH1-type cytokine
profile that characterises the response to
a limited number of antigens specifically
taken up and presented to T cells via
follicle associated epithelial cells.2 3
Studies that date back more than
20 years have demonstrated that the
colonic epithelium is abnormal in struc￾ture and function in patients with
ulcerative colitis. The epithelium com￾prises cells that are metabolically abnor￾mal (such as deficient b-oxidation4 or
sulphation of phenols5
), respond abnor￾mally to stress (as shown by the
response in vitro after its separation
from the basement membrane6 7), and
have an abnormal cell membrane (such
as abnormal permeability8
). The mucus
layer is abnormal, both in its thickness9
and composition (such as abnormal
glycosylation of mucins10–12 and abnorm￾alities of the phospholipid compo￾nent13). Many of these abnormalities
are independent of the presence of
mucosal inflammation, although
whether they are primary abnormalities
or secondary to other processes has
never been definitively demonstrated.
Why such abnormalities are present—
whether autoimmune injury to the
epithelium is occurring, whether there
might be a genetic basis for epithelial
structure or function, whether there are
luminal factors that might induce
abnormal behaviour of the epithelium,
or a combination of any or all of these—
has been the basis of much study and
speculation without definitive answers.
Targeting the epithelial barrier in
order to reduce the stimulus to inflam￾matory events, to enhance healing of
actively inflamed mucosa, and to pre￾vent relapse have also been the subject
of much speculation and study.
Approaches have ranged from improv￾ing the regenerative ability of the
epithelium (such as the use of growth
factors14 15), to trying to enhance energy
substrate supply (using butyrate ene￾mas16), and to enhancing the mucous
barrier (with trefoil peptides15 17 or
inhibition of bacterial sulphatases with
bismuth18). None of these approaches
has yet to be promoted from potential
therapy to use in regular practice
because, for example, the theoretical
basis was misguided, efficacy was lim￾ited, or further development was hin￾dered by funding difficulties and
commercial realities. Will further atten￾tion to colonic mucus change this
situation?
COLONIC MUCUS
The normal colon is lined by a layer of
mucus that is more than 100 mm thick.9
The mucus serves essential functions. It
is a lubricant ensuring low friction
between moving structures (luminal
contents) and the epithelium. This con￾ceptually simple but essential protective
function is predominantly the responsi￾bility of surface acting phospholipids.19

They form an oligolamellar lining that
converts the hydrophilic epithelial sur￾face into a hydrophobic one that inter￾faces with luminal contents. The tight
packing together of fatty acid chains
provides a good basis for a hydrophobic
barrier. Indeed, the regions of the
gastrointestinal tract with the most
developed hydrophobicity are the stom￾ach and colon, where the potential for
injurious insults from luminal factors
are the greatest.20 Most attention in
recent years has been paid to other
mucous components that subserve com￾plementary protective functions. Mucins
are glycoproteins that function to
exclude large molecules (polymers with
a molecular weight .20 000) that are
not glycoproteins, and to trap other
molecules either non-specifically via
general ‘‘stickiness’’ or more specifically
via carbohydrate structures (lectin bind￾ing sites) that may be similar to those
on the cell surface.21 Such trapped
matter can be discarded by the constant
removal of mucus. It is no surprise then
that mucus secretion is increased in the
face of threats and this may be
mediated, at least in part, by immune
events.22 The mucus environment also
supports the presence of other protective
proteins and peptides such as secretory
IgA,23 lactoferrin,24 and trefoil peptides.25
Of all of these components, it has not
been clear what is or are the most
important from functional, pathogenic,
or treatment points of view. Much of the
glamour and excitement have sur￾rounded the mucin glycoproteins and
other secreted proteins within the
mucus. However, recent evidence sug￾gests that the phospholipid component
might be a critical factor that can be
readily modulated when the mucous
barrier is failing.
PHOSPHOLIPIDS
Phospholipids, the major lipid compo￾nents of mucus, are amphiphilic mol￾ecules and contain a polar head group
and non-polar hydrocarbon (fatty acid)
tails. The major classes of phospholipids
include phosphatidylcholine (PC), phos￾phatidylethanolamine, phosphatidyl￾inostiol, and phosphatidylserine. In
colonic mucus, PC and lysophospha￾tidylcholine (LPC) are the major
species.13 LPC is an intermediate in the
metabolism of PC but is also produced
after the hydrolysis of PC by phospho￾lipase A2.26 Orientation of the lipophilic
region of the phospholipid and the
nature of the fatty acids characterise
the hydrophobicity of the mucus gel
layer.20 The fatty acid tails extend into
the lumen to form a ‘‘non-wettable’’
resistant layer.20 27 They also extend
from the mucosal cell side of the mucus
gel.27 In mucus, the PC species typically
contain one saturated (palmitic acid
16:0 or stearic acid 18:0) and one
unsaturated (oleic acid 18:1or linoleic
acid 18:2) fatty acid with PC (that is, PC
16:0/18:1 and PC 18:0/18:2).13 This
contrasts with the PC of pulmonary
surfactant, dipalmitoylphosphatidylcho￾line, which contains two saturated fatty
acids, palmitic acid (PC 16:0/16:0).19
The origin of PC in mucus has not
been established and more research is
required to understand how, when, and
where these surface active phospho￾lipids are synthesised, stored, and
secreted. In animal studies, there is
some evidence that PC is primarily
secreted by the jejunum and ileum,
suggesting that PC is delivered to the
mucus via the lumen.13 In these studies,
the contribution of PC produced via the
colonic epithelium appeared to be mini￾mal. It seems somewhat surprising and
highly unlikely that a local source of PC
secretion into the mucosal gel layer is
not operational. Goblet cells are an
obvious site for further investigation.
Approaches that have been used to
understand the role of surface active
phospholipids in the gastric mucosa and
as pulmonary surfactant could be read￾ily employed to gain a greater under￾standing about the production of
mucous PC in the colon. A great deal
has been learnt by the use of special
probes and stains specific for lipophilic
areas and choline based phospholipids
(see Lichtenberger20), and their applica￾tion to colonic mucus seems warranted.
MUCUS PHOSPHOLIPIDS IN
ULCERATIVE COLITIS
As outlined above, mucus is abnormal
in patients with ulcerative colitis. There
is, however, limited knowledge regard￾ing the phospholipid component of
colonic mucus in ulcerative colitis.
Recently, quantitatively less PC and
LPC were reported in samples taken
from the rectal mucosa of patients with
ulcerative colitis than from healthy
controls and patients with Crohn’s dis￾ease.13 This could be due to reduced
production, increased breakdown, or
both.
If indeed goblet cells do contribute to
the PC content of colonic mucus, they
might play more than a passive role in
PC depletion of mucus. Goblet cell
depletion is a more prominent patholo￾gical feature of ulcerative colitis than for
Crohn’s colitis. While it might just
reflect excessive stimulation of the gob￾let cells to discharge their mucus, the
cells might also be defective in their
ability to incorporate PC into the mucus,
offering another candidate for the pri￾mary abnormality in ulcerative colitis.
Control of PC biosynthesis is a key in
the apoptotic programme so that agents
that induce apoptosis turn off the
biosynthesis of PC.28 Most epithelial cell
death in ulcerative colitis appears to
follow an apoptotic pathway.29 30 Thus
the increased apoptosis that is occurring
in the epithelium may deplete the pool
of PC by inhibiting its biosynthesis.
PC can be destroyed within the
epithelium, thereby depleting the pool
of PC available for secretion into mucus,
or can be destroyed within the mucus
itself. Mucosal phospholipase A2 activ￾ity is increased in patients with ulcera￾tive colitis or Crohn’s disease31 32 and
this activity resides in the epithelium.33
Protein kinase C, which is involved in
several signal transduction pathways
linked with inflammatory responses
(see Brown and colleagues34), activates
a PC specific phospholipase C in the
plasma membrane with subsequent
breakdown of PC.35 Indeed, colonic
mucosa from patients with ulcerative
colitis has significantly elevated activity
of protein kinase C in the particulate
fraction compared with that in normal
mucosal samples.36 Insertion of fluores￾cent analogues of PC into the plasma
membrane of cells followed by activa￾tion of protein kinase C with phorbol
esters has been used to follow the
movement of PC and its metabolites
via fluorescent microscopy.37 A similar
approach could be used to gain a greater
understanding about the fate of PC in
the colonic mucus in ulcerative colitis
and in healthy individuals.
Once phospholipids enter the mucus
they remain vulnerable to the action of
phospholipases, which may be of
epithelial origin or derive from mucosa
associated bacteria. In the stomach,
Helicobacter pylori colonises the mucous
layer in part by producing phospho￾lipases A1, A2, and C, and can extract
the host phospholipids for its own pro￾tective coating.20 H pylori can also gen￾erate high concentrations of ammonium
ion that competes with phospholipids
for negatively charged glycoprotein
binding sites.20 It is intriguing to spec￾ulate about the possible role of a
H pylori-like bacterium that might be
responsible (in part at least) for the
breakdown of the colonic mucous bar￾rier in ulcerative colitis. Large numbers
of bacteria are found within the
depleted mucous layer of these
patients,38 39 but whether such bacteria
are efficient producers of phospho￾lipases is not known.
The net result of reduced biosynthesis
and increased breakdown of phospholi￾pids within the mucosa might be a PC
starved system in ulcerative colitis with
subsequent depletion of PC available for
mucus. Indeed, the observation that
plasma phospholipid levels are low in
patients with severe ulcerative colitis

supports such a concept.40 If this situa￾tion were combined with excessive
destruction of PC within the mucus
layer itself, the ability of PC to offer
adequate barrier and lubricant function
might be severely compromised. Could
correction of phospholipid deficiency of
the mucosa and/or mucus be of ther￾apeutic value in ulcerative colitis?
PHOSPHOLIPIDS AS A THERAPY
Phospholipids are readily taken up by
mucus, so that the mucous content can
be substantially increased by their topi￾cal administration. In experimental ani￾mals, where there is no abnormality of
mucus, topical PC protects the mucosa
from luminal insults in the form of
acetic acid and trinitrobenzenesulphonic
acid, which usually induce colitis.41 42 It
might be anticipated that the protective
and lubricant function of mucus would
be considerably enhanced by topical
application of PC in a situation such as
ulcerative colitis where PC content is
reduced.13 Such a simple concept has
recently been evaluated43 and the results
of a randomised controlled trial are
reported in this issue of Gut (see page
966). Delivery to the large bowel lumen
was achieved by coating of PC enriched
phospholipids with Eudragit-S 100.
Release of phospholipids from this pH
dependent coating would be expected to
predominantly occur in the terminal
ileum and proximal colon, a situation
mimicking the putative main source of
phospholipids in the colonic mucus.
Details of the origin (for example, from
soy or egg), and the type of phospho￾lipids and fatty acid species used in this
study were not described. Nevertheless,
PC was successfully incorporated into
rectal mucus confirming that the deliv￾ery system works.
In a population of 60 patients with
chronically active disease, the efficacy of
the PC was astoundingly good over a
three month treatment period.
Compared with a response of 10% in
the placebo arm, 90% of the phospho￾lipid treated group responded and 53%
were in remission after three months of
therapy. No clinically significant side
effects were noted. Is this too good to be
true?
There were problems with the study
design. Despite being described as a
single centre study, end points were
scored in multiple centres for practical
reasons. However, as blinding and ran￾domisation seemed appropriate, hetero￾geneity of assessment is unlikely to be a
significant factor in skewing the results.
There were also no data on the time
course of efficacy, although a comment
in the discussion indicated a slow onset
of effect over weeks. The dearth of
adverse events in a three month study
is somewhat surprising to those used to
dealing with randomised controlled
drug trials. This suggests laxity in
documenting every minor event but
again does not detract from the efficacy
demonstrated. The placebo treated
patients faired badly. A 10% response
(and remission) rate is at the lower end
of what might be anticipated in most
trials, except that patients with chroni￾cally active disease, as selected, might
have a lower placebo response. The
choice of placebo, Eudragit-S 100 coated
cellulose, may not have been appropri￾ate. Cellulose would be delivered to the
colonic lumen in an identical fashion to
that of the phospholipids and, since it is
not fermented by colonic bacteria, it
might be considered benign and inert.
However, cellulose might potentially be
abrasive to the mucosa, this being a
postulated mechanism by which non￾fermentable fibre stimulates epithelial
proliferation in fibre starved atrophic
colon in otherwise healthy rats.44 The
placebo therefore might have worsened
the outcome. On the other hand, there is
no evidence that non-fermented fibre is
detrimental to the course of ulcerative
colitis. Whatever the case, it is still
reasonable to say that three months of
therapy with PC rich phospholipids
delivered to the colonic lumen were
convincingly efficacious in inducing
remission in patients with chronically
active ulcerative colitis.
What about the mechanism of action?
It would be precarious to assign this
efficacy to the improved hydrophobicity
and barrier function of the mucus
without confirmatory data. The hydro￾phobicity of the mucosal layer can be
quantified from the ‘‘contact angle’’
after a drop of saline is placed on the
mucosal surface.27 Whether this simple
test can be carried out on biopsy speci￾mens or even at colonoscopy is uncer￾tain, but such an assessment in patients
with ulcerative colitis seems worth￾while. Alternatively, effects on mucus
might only be a minor player in the
efficacy. Replenishment of the epithelial
pool of PC, with its potential positive
effects on improving epithelial health,
limiting epithelial destruction, and sup￾pressing its involvement with inflam￾matory mechanisms, as discussed
above, might also be an important
mechanism of action.
FUTURE DIRECTIONS
The findings that treatment with PC rich
phospholipids permits healing of other￾wise difficult to treat ulcerative colitis
opens a new approach to the treatment
of ulcerative colitis. There is the impor￾tant need to confirm the results using a
more appropriate placebo (perhaps free
unsaturated fatty acid such as linoleic
acid in place of the cellulose), to
determine the appropriate dose, and to
define the time course of effect.
Additional questions are raised by the
complex nature of the phospholipid
mixture used. For example, is the effect
observed indeed due to the PC compo￾nent or is the active moiety a minor part
of the phospholipid mixture, such as the
unsaturated fatty acid component? The
question of how this phospholipid mix￾ture is achieving its efficacy, particularly
whether it is acting via reinforcement of
the mucus, as seems logical, or by other
mechanisms, needs to be addressed.
While there has been much previous
focus on the mucin glycoproteins, this
work shows that more attention needs
to be drawn to the less glamorous lipid
component, which is not simply playing
an inert structural role in the mucus gel
layer but rather is a dynamic component
of a complex barrier system. The puta￾tive efficacy of PC might be enhanced by
better distribution using spreading
agents. Perhaps liposomes of PC could
be used to introduce other therapies
such as anti-inflammatory drugs or even
antisense RNA that will assist with
epithelial healing—two for the price of
one! There is also the potential to
introduce phospholipids and fatty acid
species, such as arachidonic and butyric
acids that may have cytoprotective
properties. Welcome phospholipids to
the cutting edge of ulcerative colitis!

Insulin resistance and steatosis in
hepatitis C virus infection
A Zekry, J G McHutchison, A M Diehl
...................................................................................
The relationship between hepatitis C virus (HCV), steatosis, and
insulin resistance is genotype specific, and steatosis and insulin
resistance are closely linked to the progression of liver disease in
HCV infected patients
S
ince the identification of hepatitis
C virus (HCV) in the late 1980s,
chronic HCV infection has emerged
as a complex multifaceted disease with
manifestations extending beyond the
liver. As such, hepatic steatosis, insulin
resistance (IR), and type II diabetes
have been observed to occur more
frequently in association with HCV
infection than other chronic inflamma￾tory liver disease.1 A proportion of HCV
infected patients with steatosis also
exhibit several of the clinical features
seen in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis
(NASH), questioning the significance
of these metabolic disorders in the
pathogenesis of HCV related liver dis￾ease. Hence, considerable HCV research
has recently been directed towards
understanding the mechanisms under￾lying the development of these meta￾bolic manifestations in HCV infected
patients and their implications in the
progression of liver disease. Several
important questions have been exam￾ined: are these metabolic disorders in
HCV infected patients a result of viral or
host factors and, if viral, how do viral
proteins interfere with lipid and insulin
metabolism? What is the primary event
in these patients (steatosis or IR) and
what are the implications of steatosis
and IR in the pathogenesis of liver
disease? Finally, how can we exploit
our current knowledge for developing
effective therapeutic strategies for HCV
infected patients?
In this issue of Gut, Fartoux and
colleagues2 utilise the homeostasis
model assessment for IR (HOMA IR)
index to study the association between
steatosis and IR in patients with chronic
HCV infection (see page 1003). In order
to examine this association, the authors
excluded patients with alternate factors

known to be associated with the devel￾opment of steatosis (such as alcohol
intake .20 g/day or diabetes). Their
findings confirm earlier observations3–5
that differing and genotype specific
mechanisms characterise the develop￾ment of hepatic steatosis in HCV
infected patients. Accordingly, steatosis
in genotype 3 infected patients is pri￾marily viral mediated (cytopathic)
whereas host factors, principally those
associated with IR and its clinical
attributes, are responsible for the devel￾opment of steatosis in the genotype 1
infected patient.
DIRECT STEATOGENIC EFFECT OF
HCV
Evidence for a HCV genotype 3 specific
steatogenic effect has come from several
clinical observations (table 1).3 6–8
Furthermore, this direct steatogenic
effect of HCV is highly reproducible in
transgenic mice and cell culture models
of hepatitis C, in which overexpression
of viral protein (such as core and NS5A)
has been shown to induce accumula￾tion of intracytoplasmic triglyceride rich
droplets.9
There are several identified mechan￾isms whereby HCV may alter lipid
metabolism. Firstly, HCV core protein
has been shown to directly inhibit the
function of microsomal triglyceride
transfer protein, a major regulator of
hepatic assembly, and secretion of nas￾cent triglyceride rich very low density
lipoproteins (VLDL). The latter effect
impairs the ability of hepatocytes to
assemble and secret VLDL.10 11 Secondly,
HCV core protein has been observed to
induce mitochondrial injury resulting in
oxidative stress. Oxidative stress per￾turbs lipid peroxidation, thereby con￾tributing to the development of
steatosis.12–14 Finally, microarray studies
have illustrated the ability of HCV (in
particular genotype 3) to induce tran￾scription of several genes involved in
lipid metabolism in the liver.15 16 Among
these is stearoyl coenzyme A desaturase
4 (SCD4), a rate limiting enzyme in the
synthesis of monounsaturated fats.15
Reduced expression of SCD4 in livers
of ob/ob mice has been shown to
significantly ameliorate hepatic steato￾sis.17
INSULIN RESISTANCE AND
STEATOSIS IN HCV INFECTED
PATIENTS
Steatosis in patients with genotype 1
infection is increasingly recognised as a
component of the metabolic syndrome,
a condition invariably associated with
IR. In support, host factors such as age,
body mass index (BMI), and central
obesity, have been shown to correlate
with the development of steatosis in
genotype 1 infected patients (but not
genotype 3).18 Fartoux and colleagues2
have further demonstrated that HOMA
IR was the only risk factor indepen￾dently associated with the development
of steatosis in genotype 1 infected
patients (p = 0.001). Moreover, the
degree of steatosis was significantly
predictive of HOMA IR (p = 0.004).
There are several uncertainties
regarding the cascade of events leading
to the development of IR and steatosis
in HCV infected patients with features
of the metabolic syndrome. As such,
whether IR or steatosis is the primary or
secondary event in these patients is
unclear.
Overall, there are sufficient clinical
and experimental data indicating that
excess fat can perpetuate IR: large
epidemiological studies reveal that the
risk of IR rises as body fat content
(determined by BMI) increases, from
the very lean to the very obese.19
Experimental evidence also indicates
that intracellular accumulation of fatty
acid metabolites (either through
increased delivery or decreased metabo￾lism) in the liver or muscle directly
promotes serine phosphorylation (in
contrast with tyrosine phosphorylation)
of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1).
This effect leads to impaired glucose
transport activity and other events
downstream of insulin receptor signal￾ling.20 In this respect, measures to
reduce circulating free fatty acid and
liver triglyceride content have been
shown to restore insulin signalling and
reverse both hepatic and muscle IR
induced by high fat diets.17 21
Another common link in the deve￾lopment of IR and steatosis is the
adipocyte secreted proteins leptin and
adiponectin. Leptin is a protein product
of the adipocyte obese (ob) gene. Serum
leptin levels have been observed to be
increased in patients with NASH and
chronic HCV infection.22 23 Moreover, in
each of these diseases, serum leptin
level has been reported to independently
correlate with hepatic steatosis.22 24
While it is recognised that the effect of
leptin on insulin sensitivity is variable,
increased expression of leptin in hepa￾tocytes has been shown to attenuate
several insulin induced activities,
including tyrosine phosphorylation of
IRS-1.25
Adiponectin is abundantly synthe￾sised and secreted by adipose tissue.
Serum levels of adiponectin correlate
with systemic insulin sensitivity. More
recently, low levels of serum adiponec￾tin have been shown to correlate with
the presence of steatosis in patients with
chronic HCV infection. The latter obser￾vation suggests a role for adiponectin in
the development of IR and steatosis in
these patients.26
In contrast with the effect of fat on
IR, insulin itself controls the regulation
of a host of genes involved in lipid
metabolism.27 The ability of insulin to
activate lipogenesis is partly mediated
by inducing the transcription of the
sterol regulatory element binding pro￾tein 1c (SREBP-1c), a key regulator of
fatty acid synthesis in the liver. The
effect of insulin on SREBP-1c transcrip￾tion is even more apparent in the
presence of profound IR.28 In this
setting, obese animals with IR have
increased levels of SREBP-1c resulting
in increased rates of fatty acid synthesis
and the development of hepatic steato￾sis.29 30 Subsequent normalisation of
SREBP-1 expression in these animals
dramatically ameliorates steatosis.28
HCV AND INSULIN RESISTANCE
Several studies (including that of
Fartoux and colleagues2
) evaluating IR
in patients with chronic HCV infection
have found that the development of IR
can occur early in the course of the
disease. This effect appears to be inde￾pendent of body weight, stage of liver
disease, and presence or absence of
overt diabetes.31–33 There are other
clinical observations supporting a ‘‘fat
independent’’ mechanism in the devel￾opment of IR in HCV infected patients.
Firstly, Fartoux and colleagues2 and
others32 have observed that patients
infected with HCV genotype 3 have
more extensive hepatic steatosis but a
lower incidence of IR.32 This observation
supports a genotype specific mechanism
underlying IR in HCV infected
patients.32 Secondly, two studies
demonstrated that clearance of HCV
with antiviral therapy resulted in
restoration of insulin sensitivity and
euglycaemia.34 35 Finally, the extent of
IR has been shown to correlate with the
Table 1 Clinical evidence for a steatogenic effect for genotype 3
l Hepatic steatosis is present in the majority of patients with genotype 3 infection
l Hepatic steatosis correlates with the level of HCV RNA in serum and the liver
l In patients infected with genotype 3 (but not genotype 1), successful viral clearance with antiviral
therapy results in the disappearance of steatosis, only to recur on viral relapse
l IR has been observed to be less common among genotype 3 infected patients, even in those with
extensive hepatic steatosis.

grade of portal inflammation in HCV
infected patients.32 Collectively, these
data suggest that either HCV per se or
the inflammatory response incited by
HCV in the liver is central to the
development of IR. This first hypothesis
has been recently verified in HCV core
transgenic mice, observed to develop IR
resistance as early as one month of age,
in the absence of either overt liver injury
or excessive body weight gain.
The precise mechanisms whereby
HCV induces IR remain elusive but
recent progress has shed light on several
critical pathways. Impairment of IRS-1
and IRS-2 expression has been observed
in the livers of both HCV infected
patients as well as in HCV core trans￾genic mice.36 37 Specifically, HCV core
protein has been shown to inhibit
insulin induced phosphorylation of the
p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol
3-kinase (PI3K) and Akt, which are
downstream components of IRS in the
liver.37 Interestingly, HCV has been
reported to mediate dysfunction of the
insulin signalling pathways by upregu￾lating the expression of suppressor of
cytokine signalling 3 (SOC3).37 This
observation is quite important in light
of recent data demonstrating direct
involvement of SOC1 and SOC3 in
regulating expression of SREBP-1c in
the livers of obese animals.38 In these
animal models, overexpression of SOC1
and SOC3 proteins has been shown to
enhance SREBP-1c promoter activity
by attenuating signal transducer and
activator of transcription 3 (STAT-3)
mediated inhibition of this region.38
The net effect in these animals was
development of systemic IR and hepatic
steatosis. Conversely, inhibiting expres￾sion of SOCs protein in obese animals
normalised levels of SREBP-1 and
improved insulin sensitivity and hepatic
steatosis. Consistent with these data,
hepatic STAT-3 signalling has recently
been shown to be essential for normal
glucose homeostasis and insulin sensi￾tivity.39 These observations are relevant
as HCV is recognised as influencing the
activity of STAT-3. It is therefore intri￾guing to speculate that STAT-3 may be
one of the key molecules involved in
HCV mediated IR (fig 1).
ROLE OF CYTOKINES
Tumour necrosis factor a (TNF-a) levels
are elevated in the liver and serum of
patients with chronic HCV infection.
TNF-a plays an important role in the
development of IR through interfering
with insulin signalling.40 In IR HCV core
transgenic mice, treatment with anti￾TNF-a restored insulin sensitivity, thus
supporting the notion that TNF-a is a
major factor for the development of IR
in HCV infection.31
ROLE OF STEATOSIS AND
INSULIN RESISTANCE IN
PROGRESSION OF HCV LIVER
DISEASE
In agreement with previous
reports,3 4 7 41 Fartoux and colleagues2
observed an association between stea￾tosis and severity of fibrosis, irrespective
of HCV genotype. While insulin levels
were predictive of fibrosis in their
univariate analysis, subsequent multi￾variate analysis confirmed steatosis, but
not insulin levels, to be independently
associated with fibrosis (p = 0.02).
Thus two keys questions arise: is fat
per se fibrogenic and what is the role of
insulin in the fibrotic process?
Steatosis is associated with increased
production of reactive oxygen species
which initiate lipid peroxidation, result￾ing in hepatic stellate cell activation.42
However, in NASH, disease progression
is recognised as being slower than that
observed in patients with HCV infection
and steatosis. Thus it is likely that the
coexistence of HCV and steatosis aggra￾vates and accelerates the injury induced
by each alone. In this setting, hepatic
inflammation induced by the host
response, together with the increased
production of several proinflammatory
and profibrotic cytokines, provide the
substrate for the ‘‘second hit’’ in the
steatotic liver. Also, the ability of the
virus itself to induce oxidative stress and
promote lipid peroxidation may further
aggravate the pathogenic process
induced by steatosis. Consider also that
fat may render HCV infected liver more
vulnerable to injury. Livers with steato￾sis are more sensitive to TNF-a mediated
inflammation and liver injury.43
Moreover, in HCV livers with steatosis,
apoptosis activity has been noted to be
increased compared with infected livers
without steatosis.44
While Fartoux and colleagues2 could
not find a direct association between IR
and fibrosis, others have.32 33 45 The
authors do concede that insulin plays a
significant role in the development of
fibrosis via a mechanism involving
steatosis. In this regard, steatosis pro￾motes cellular IR which, in turn, induces
compensatory hyperinsulinaemia.
Hyperinsulinaemia has been shown to
directly stimulate hepatic stellate cell
proliferation and increase expression of
connective tissue growth factor, a key
factor in the progression of fibrosis.46
Collectively, the data implicate both
steatosis and IR in liver disease progres￾sion in HCV infected patients.
CONCLUSIONS
Our knowledge of the mechanisms and
significance of steatosis and IR in
patients with chronic HCV infection
has advanced. The work by Fartoux
and colleagues2 adds to the growing
evidence that the relationship between
HCV, steatosis, and IR is genotype
specific and that steatosis and IR are
closely linked to the progression of liver
disease in HCV infected patients. As

Figure 1 Molecules that are likely to be involved in mediating insulin resistance (IR) in hepatitis C
virus (HCV) infection. Tumour necrosis factor a (TNF-a) is increased in the serum and liver of HCV
infected patients. TNF induces IR by decreasing the tyrosine kinase activity of insulin receptor
substrate 1 (IRS-1).39 Treatment of HCV core transgenic mice with anti-TNF-a has been shown to
restore insulin sensitivity. High levels of suppressor of cytokine signalling 3 (SOC3) have been
detected in association with IR in HCV infection. This effect was associated with reduced insulin
induced phosphorylation of the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and Akt.37
SOC3 (and possibly HCV) can attenuate the activity of signal transducer and activator of
transcription 3 (STAT-3). Mice lacking STAT-3 specifically in the liver have been reported to exhibit
IR and, when fed a high fat diet, glucose intolerance. The latter was associated with increased
expression of the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) gene.38 The PEPCK gene itself is a
target for leptin (also increased in HCV infection) mediated regulation of gluconeogenesis in the
liver. Finally, reduced expression of adiponectin is associated with obesity and IR. Low serum levels
of adiponectin have been shown to correlate with steatosis in HCV infected patients.26

inter-relationships. In light of our cur￾rent knowledge of the implications of
steatosis and IR in liver disease, the
importance of lifestyle changes (such as
weight loss) need to be an emphasised

Similarly, new therapeutic approaches
exploiting the interaction between HCV
and lipid metabolism are eagerly
awaited.
