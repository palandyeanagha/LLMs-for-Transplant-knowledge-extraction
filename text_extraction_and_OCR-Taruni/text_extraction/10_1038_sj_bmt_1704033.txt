Summary:
Thalidomide was used to treat acute (n=21) or chronic (n=59)
graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) in 80 haematopoietic stem cell
allograft recipients after failure to respond to the combination of
cyclosporine and corticosteroids with or without other agents. The
median time to onset of acute GVHD was 11 days, and thalidomide
was started at a median of 48 days post transplant. In addition to
corticosteroids and cyclosporine, 13 patients had also received
other agents before thalidomide. None of the patients responded
and all died of acute GVHD. For chronic GVHD (limited in 13,
extensive in 46), thalidomide was started at a median of 385 days
post transplant. In addition to corticosteroids and cyclosporine, 34
patients received azathioprine concomitantly. In all patients,
thalidomide was added to the ongoing immunosuppressive regimen.
The median duration of therapy with thalidomide was 60 days
(range, 11–1210; <2 weeks in 11). In total, 13 patients (22%) had
complete response, eight (14%) partial response and 38 (64%) no
response. Response rates were comparable for limited (39%) and
extensive (33%) chronic GVHD. At a median of 53 months, 19
patients are alive, 13 without evidence of chronic GVHD. Survival
was significantly better in patients who responded to thalidomide.
The principal causes of death were progressive chronic GVHD
(n=29) and relapsed leukaemia (n=7). In conclusion, thalidomide
has no activity in acute GVHD, but has some activity in chronic
GVHD in combination with other agents.
