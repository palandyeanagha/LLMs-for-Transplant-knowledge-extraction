Abstract
Background: Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) continues to be a frequent and potentially severe infection. There
is currently no validated clinical tool for use at the time of CDI diagnosis to categorize patients in order to predict
response to therapy.
Methods: Six clinical and laboratory variables, measured at the time of CDI diagnosis, were combined in order to
assess their correlation with treatment response in a large CDI clinical trial database (derivation cohort). The final
categorization scheme was chosen in order to maximize the number of categories (discrimination) while
maintaining a high correlation with clinical cure assessed two days after the end of therapy. Validation of the
derived scoring scheme was done on a second large CDI clinical trial database (validation cohort). A third
comparison was done on the two pooled databases (pooled cohort).
Results: In the derivation cohort, the best discrimination and correlation with cure was seen with a five-component
ATLAS score (age, treatment with systemic antibiotics, leukocyte count, albumin and serum creatinine as a measure
of renal function), which divided CDI patients into 11 groups (scores of 0 to 10 inclusive) and was highly correlated
with treatment outcome (R2
=0.95; P<0.001). This scheme showed excellent prediction of cure in the validation
cohort (overall Kappa=95.2%; P<0.0001), as well as in the pooled cohort, regardless of treatment (fidaxomicin or
vancomycin).
Conclusions: A combination of five simple and commonly available clinical and laboratory variables measured at
the time of CDI diagnosis, combined into a scoring system (ATLAS), are able to accurately predict treatment
response to CDI therapy. The ATLAS scoring system may be useful in stratifying CDI patients so that appropriate
therapies can be chosen to maximize cure rates, as well as for categorization of patients in CDI therapeutic studies
in order allow comparisons of patient groups.
Background
Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) has emerged during
the last decade as a serious and increasingly common
healthcare-associated infection [1]. The emergence of
hypervirulent strains has resulted in elevated rates of CDI￾related complications (e.g. colectomy, need for intensive
care) and increased mortality, especially among the elderly
[2,3]. Newer treatment options, such as novel antibacte￾rials [4], immune modulators [5] and immunotherapeutics
[6], have led to a recent expansion in the number of clin￾ical trials involving subjects with this serious infection.
Despite more than 3 decades of research involving this
condition, a validated “severity scale” has yet to be devel￾oped which correlates with treatment response, which is
predictive of severe outcomes (i.e. colectomy, need for in￾tensive care, or attributable mortality) or which predicts
CDI recurrence. Although several predictive scoring sys￾tems and clinical variables have been described in limited
CDI populations or case series, none have been validated
on large CDI databases [7-16]. While the choice of the￾rapy for malignant neoplasms and subjects with sepsis
is often based on validated criteria which consist of both

patient and disease-related variables in order to maximize
treatment response [17,18], no such validated scheme
exists for CDI. The absence of such a categorization
system means that the choice of therapies for a par￾ticular patient is often not evidence-based, and clinical
trials investigating CDI outcomes may be comparing
dissimilar patient populations. Recent guidelines which
have put forward “severity categories” for CDI have not
validated these categorizations and their correlation
with treatment outcome, disease outcome and CDI re￾currence are unknown [19,20]. We have used 2 large
clinical therapeutic trials for treating CDI in order to
derive and then validate a categorization system to dis￾criminate among CDI patients and correlate the group￾ing with treatment response.
Methods
Two large databases, which were derived while conduc￾ting therapeutic trials that compared fidaxomicin and
vancomycin for the treatment of CDI, were used for
the present analyses [4,21]. The clinical and trial details
for the two identical CDI therapy studies are described
elsewhere [4]. Briefly, 10 days of therapy with either
vancomycin or fidaxomicin was administered to CDI
patients. The first trial (“003”) enrolled patients in the
United States and Canada; the second trial (“004”) en￾rolled patients in those two countries as well as in
Europe. The response to treatment was assessed two
days following the last day of therapy. Patients consi￾dered as a “cure” were then followed for an additional
28 days to evaluate them for a CDI recurrence. This
present analyses used all patients included in each of the
respective trials if they had a confirmed diagnosis of CDI
and received at least 1 dose of study medication (“modi￾fied intent to treat” group; mITT). Since the vancomycin
and fidaxomicin arms had nearly identical cure rates [4],
all patients in each study were combined into a single
group regardless of the therapy they were randomized to
receive. The mITT group of patients consisted of 596 in￾dividuals in the 003 study, 509 individuals in the 004
study, and a total of 1105 subjects in both combined
studies. All subjects in both studies gave informed con￾sent which also allowed for secondary analyses of the
databases such as in the present investigation. No ad￾ditional form of ethical approval was required to do
this subgroup risk analysis, as the original ethical ap￾proval for the trial covered such analyses. The study
sponsor permitted the authors to access the trial data
for this analysis; the dataset used was preexisting, de￾identified and required no further collection of data
from patients.
The six clinical and laboratory parameters used in the
analyses were chosen for their ready availability, their
ease of calculation, prior correlation with CDI outcome
in case series [7-16], and the fact that they had been col￾lected and were available in the two CDI clinical trials of
interest. The six parameters, measured on the day of
entry into the study (i.e. within 48 hours of a positive
C. difficile toxin assay) were: age (in years) [Ag], treat￾ment with systemic antibiotics (which occurred on one
or more days of CDI therapy) [Tr], temperature (in de￾grees Celsius) [Te], total leukocyte count [L], serum al￾bumin [Al], and serum creatinine as a measure of renal
function [S]. A logistic regression model was created
using “cure” as the dependant variable and the six clin￾ical/lab parameters as the independent variables. Due to
high co-correlation of some of the six independent vari￾ables (i.e. age, albumin and serum creatinine showing
high Pearson correlation coefficients), it was decided
instead to use these indices in a clinical score. Scores
of 0, 1 or 2 were assigned to each parameter value,
based on their relative importance as seen in previ￾ously published analyses (Table 1). All possible com￾binations of these six parameters were assessed for
their correlation with cure at end of therapy. Correla￾tion was assessed using linear regression, with a forced
value of 100 on the y axis for a score of 0 on the x axis, in
order to make the ensuing regression formula clinically
meaningful. Statistical analyses were performed with SPSS
software.
During the first step of this analysis, the derivation
process, the 003 trial database was used to test the com￾binations for their correlation with treatment response.
The optimal combination in this derivation analysis, to
be used for the validation analysis, was considered to be
the combination which met the following criteria:
Table 1 Clinical and laboratory variables, along with their respective values and points, for determining the optimal
scoring system which correlates with cure after CDI therapy
Parameter 0 points 1 point 2 points
Age < 60 years 60 – 79 years ≥ 80 years
Treatment with systemic antibiotics during CDI therapy (≥ 1 day) No ——————— Yes
Temperature ≤ 37.5°C 37.6 – 38.5°C ≥ 38.6°C
Leukocyte count (total) < 16,000 16,000 – 25,000 > 25,000
Albumin (serum) > 35 g/L 26 – 35 g/L ≤ 25 g/L
Serum creatinine (as a measure of renal function) ≤ 120 μmol/L 121 – 179 μmol/L ≥ 180 μmol/L

i. Correlation with cure having an R2 value ≥ 0.9
ii. Correlation with cure having a P value ≤ 0.01
If multiple combinations met the above 2 conditions,
the combination consisting of the largest number of var￾iables was considered as the optimal combination, since
this scheme would be able to categorize the patients into
the largest number of distinct groups (i.e. highest dis￾criminative ability and category utility) [22].
During the second step of this analysis, the validation
process, the predicted cure rate from the optimum com￾bination chosen in step one (using the derived regression
formula) was compared to the actual CDI cure rate as seen
in the 004 clinical trial database. This was done by means
of Kappa statistics of the cure rate for each score category.
During a final step of this analysis, the two clinical
studies (003 and 004) were pooled and the optimum
combination which had been derived in the first step
was used to compare the predicted and actual cure rates
for this entire cohort, again using a Chi-Square analysis
for each score group.
Results
Step 1. Derivation of the optimal categorization
scoring system.
All of the possible combinations and permutations of
the six chosen variables are listed in Table 2, along with
their respective correlations with treatment response in
the first (003) clinical trial, as demonstrated by the re￾spective R2 and P values. The 12 combinations which
each demonstrated an R2 value of ≥ 0.9 with a P value
of ≤ 0.01 were:
1) Age, albumin
2) Temperature, albumin
3) Age, leukocyte count
4) Age, treatment with systemic antibiotics, leukocyte
count
5) Age, temperature, serum creatinine
6) Age, temperature, leukocyte count
7) Temperature, albumin, leukocyte count
8) Age, treatment with systemic antibiotics,
temperature, serum creatinine
9) Age, temperature, albumin, serum creatinine
10) Age, temperature, leukocyte count, albumin
11) Temperature, leukocyte count, albumin, serum
creatinine
12) Age, treatment with systemic antibiotics, leukocyte
count, albumin, serum creatinine
Of these 12 candidate combinations, the most discri￾minating (containing the largest number of variables and
thereby separating the patients into the largest num￾ber of unique groups) was the combination of age (Ag),
treatment with systemic antibiotics (Tr), leukocyte count
(L), serum albumin (Al) and serum creatinine as a meas￾ure of renal function (S) (abbreviated herewith as ATLAS).
The ATLAS combination produced a scoring system
which was able to place the CDI patients into 11 unique
categories (scores 0 to 10, inclusive) and this correlated
with treatment cure with an R-squared value of 0.95 and
a highly significant P value of < 0.001. The regression
equation for this correlation was shown to be: cure rate =
100 – [5.08 × (ATLAS score)]. The receiver operating
characteristics of the ATLAS score for predicting treat￾ment cure are shown in Figure 1 (area under the curve
was calculated to be 0.71).
Step 2. Validation of the categorization system from
step 1.
The actual cure rates and the predicted cure rates (de￾rived from the regression equation calculated in step 1)
for each of the ATLAS categories of the CDI patients in
the mITT population of the 004 clinical trial are seen in
Table 3.
The ATLAS categorization scheme was able to very
closely (overall Kappa=95.2%; P<0.0001) predict the ac￾tual cure rate for these patients in every score category.
Step 3. Capacity of the ATLAS score to predict cure
for the pooled CDI patient databases, and by
treatment allocation.
In order to assess how the ATLAS scoring system
would perform when all patients in both trials were
placed into a single database, this categorization scheme
was used to compare the predicted cure rates and the
actual cure rates for all mITT patients, as well as for the
two sub-groups of patients as determined by treatment
allocation (i.e. fidaxomicin or vancomycin). The results
of these analyses can be seen in Table 4. Again, excellent
predictive ability of the ATLAS system is seen for the
entire database and for each of the two assigned treat￾ment groups.
Discussion
The current classifications of “mild”, “moderate”, “se￾vere”, and “fulminant” CDI are unvalidated, subjective,
and have not yet been shown to be clinically useful. An
easy to use, objective, clinically relevant and validated
system of categorizing CDI patients is needed in order
to choose among the growing number of available the￾rapies, to decide which patients might benefit from ad￾junctive therapies, to facilitate communication among
healthcare providers, to prognosticate the outcome of

therapy, and to categorize patients for CDI intervention
trials.
Two large CDI clinical trial databases, the fidaxomi￾cin/vancomycin comparative trials, were used to derive
and then to validate a CDI patient categorization scheme
which could predict cure at the end of therapy. This
derived scoring system, the ATLAS score, was able to
categorize CDI patients into 11 distinct categories and
was able to predict clinical cure with a high degree of
accuracy.
Several issues concerning these analyses should be men￾tioned. Firstly, the two databases used for the analyses
were phase 3 clinical trials, which excluded extremely ill

CDI patients. As per the study protocol, patients were ex￾cluded if they had “life-threatening or fulminant CDAD”
(WBC >30 × 109
/L; temperature >40°C or evidence of
hypotension and septic shock, peritoneal signs or signifi￾cant dehydration), toxic megacolon, or were likely to die
within 72 hours of study enrollment [4]. Therefore, there
is an under-representation of CDI patients in the upper
extremes of the score values. The distribution of patients,
by ATLAS score, in the two clinical trial databases
(Figure 2) may not represent all CDI patient populations
in all healthcare systems. For instance, CDI patients

manifest CDI while in an intensive care unit (ICU) may
not conform to the prediction scheme, even though im￾munocompromised patients and ICU patients were
enrolled into the two analyzed studies, if they were other￾wise eligible. Secondly, other clinical or laboratory vari￾ables measured at the time of CDI diagnosis but not
included in this analysis, may also aid in the predictive
model of clinical cure. However, we chose clinical vari￾ables which have been repeatedly demonstrated to be cor￾related with disease outcome. Inclusion of the infecting
strain type (i.e. NAP1/027/BI) into the categorization
scheme might increase the predictive ability, since infec￾tions with this strain have been shown to increase the
chance of poor outcomes from CDI [23]. However, at the
present time, typing of the infecting strain is not widely
available, and other non-NAP1/027/BI hyper-virulent
strain types have already been described and may continue
to emerge in the future [3].
Thirdly, a different use of the clinical variables with
other weighting schemes, might give a more accurate
predictive model. The variations in factor weighting and
combinations are virtually limitless, and multivariate re￾gression analysis was not helpful in determining the
weighting scheme, since many of the factors highly pre￾dictive of outcome (i.e. albumin, age, serum creatinine)
are very highly correlated with each other and negated
each other in the multivariate models. Fourthly, it should
be noted that only clinical cure was assessed in these ana￾lyses. We did a preliminary analysis investigating the cap￾acity of this scoring system to predict CDI recurrence at
28 days post-therapy, and the five-component ATLAS
score performed poorly in this regard. Other combina￾tions performed better for predicting CDI recurrence, and
those analyses will be undertaken at a later time. Lastly,
this scoring system worked well in predicting response to
both fidaxomicin and to vancomycin. Since no patients re￾ceived metronidazole in these 2 clinical studies, it remains
unknown how the ATLAS score would perform in
predicting cure rates with this agent. However, the ATLAS
categorization of CDI patients may now allow post-hoc
comparisons of CDI patients treated with vancomycin and
metronidazole in other databases in order to examine if
there is truly a difference in outcome with these two
agents in sub-groups of patients with specific scores.
Conclusion
In conclusion, a combination of five simple clinical
and laboratory variables measured at the time of CDI
diagnosis, combined into an 11-category scoring sys￾tem (ATLAS), seems to be able to accurately predict
treatment response to CDI therapy by either vanco￾mycin or fidaxomicin. The ATLAS scoring system may be
useful to stratify CDI patients in order to prospectively
evaluate and compare CDI therapies among patient cate￾gories, to choose therapies for patient sub-groups to ma￾ximize cure rates, to categorize patients in different CDI
therapeutic studies in order to allow between-study com￾parisons of patient groups, and to stratify patients upon
entry into CDI therapeutic trials.
