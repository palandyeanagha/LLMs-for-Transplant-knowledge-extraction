Introduction
Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a signifi cant cause of 
morbidity and mortality in hospitalized patients, 
especially those who are critically ill. Th e mortality rate 
in patients with severe AKI requiring renal replacement 
therapy (RRT) can exceed 50% [1]. Numerous factors 
contribute to the development of AKI, including reduc￾tions in renal blood fl ow, actions of nephrotoxic drugs, 
cellular injury/death of proximal tubule epithelial cells, 
pro-infl ammatory responses of renal endothelial cells, 
infl ux and activation of infl ammatory leukocytes that 
further reduces renal blood fl ow through vascular con￾ges tion and promotes and extends injury to kidney 
parenchymal cells [2,3]. Th e immune response in AKI 
involves cells of both the innate and adaptive immune 
systems. Although numerous studies have demonstrated 
the detrimental role of many diff erent types of immune 
cells, recent reports have uncovered a protective and 
possibly therapeutic role of other immune cells in AKI. 
Studies in animal models of AKI have revealed that 
innate immune cells, such as neutrophils, macrophages, 
dendritic cells, natural killer (NK) cells and natural killer 
T (NKT) cells, and adaptive CD4+ T cells promote renal 
injury. Indeed, renal infl ammation is a common feature 
of human AKI [4] and detailed analyses of biopsy samples 
from patients with AKI demonstrated the presence of 
mononuclear leukocytes (some CD3+ T cells) and neutro￾phils [5]. In contrast, CD4+FoxP3+ regulatory T cells 
(Tregs) can protect the kidney from ischemic and nephro￾toxic injury in animal models. Understanding the immune 
mechanisms of renal injury and protection should yield 
new approaches to prevention and treatment of AKI. 
Th is review will summarize current knowledge on the 
role of the immune system in the pathogenesis of AKI.
Detrimental actions of pro-infl ammatory 
leukocytes
Neutrophils
Polymorphonuclear cells (PMNs or neutrophils) are 
critical mediators of innate immunity. Th ey respond 
rapidly (within minutes) to invading pathogens and to 
sites of tissue damage. Neutrophils clear invading 
pathogens by phagocytosis or by releasing toxic granules 
containing proteases and other enzymes and reactive 
oxygen species (ROS). For this reason, neutrophil de￾granu lation can lead to damage of host cells in the 
infl amed tissue. In several mouse models of AKI (e.g., 
ischemia/reperfusion injury and cisplatin-induced kidney 
injury), neutrophil accumulation in the injured kidney is 
a consistent and early fi nding [6–8] and depletion of 
neutrophils [6] or prevention of neutrophil traffi cking to 
the kidney [9] reduces kidney injury. In addition to 
releas ing granules, neutrophils have been shown to pro￾duce the pro-infl ammatory cytokines, interferon (IFN)-γ 
and interleukin (IL)-17, and the chemokine CXCL1, in 
the injured kidney [7,9]. Th ese fi ndings demonstrate the 
involvement of neutrophils in the pathogenesis of kidney 
injury in the commonly used murine model of ischemia/
reperfusion-induced AKI. Studies in some other species 
have reported a lack of signifi cant neutrophil accumu￾lation and no benefi t after neutrophil depletion; however, 
these results may be related to diff erences in experimental 
models and limitations to methods for neutrophil deple￾tion (see [10] and references therein).
Macrophages
Macrophages are phagocytic cells that arise from mono￾cytes in the blood. Macrophage numbers increase early

in the injured kidney (within 1 hour of reperfusion in an 
ischemia/reperfusion model [11]), and this infi ltration is 
mediated by CCR2 and CX3CR1 signaling pathways 
[12,13]. Th ese macrophages have a distinct ‘infl amed’ 
F4/80lowLy6ChighGR-1+
CX3CR1low phenotype [12]. Depletion 
of macrophages, using liposomal clodronate, prior to 
kidney ischemia/reperfusion injury, reduced renal injury 
and adoptive transfer of macrophages reconstituted AKI 
[14]. Although macrophage infi ltration is observed in 
cisplatin-induced experimental AKI, blockade of 
macrophage traffi cking to the kidney did not prevent 
renal injury [15]. Analysis of post-ischemic kidney infi l￾trating macrophages by fl ow cytometry demonstrated 
that they are signifi cant producers of many pro-infl am￾ma tory cytokines, including IL-6 and tumor necrosis 
factor (TNF)-α [12]. Another study identifi ed IL-6 
expres sion in renal outer medulla macrophages by in situ
hybridization 4 hours after ischemia/reperfusion injury 
and IL-6 defi cient mice are protected from kidney 
ischemia/reperfusion injury [16]. Recently, diff erent types 
of macrophages have been described that either promote 
or inhibit infl ammation, M1 and M2 macrophages, res￾pect ively [17]. New experimental evidence has demon￾strated that once recruited to the post-ischemic kidney, 
macrophages display an M1 pro-infl ammatory pheno￾type, but several days later those same macrophages 
change to an M2 phenotype and are vital in the repair 
process of the kidney [18].
Natural killer cells
NK cells are similar to lymphocytes of the adaptive 
immune system but lack a T cell receptor. Th eir activation 
is governed by signals received from activating and 
inhibitory receptors on their cell surface. Th e ligands for 
these NK cell receptors are expressed on target cells and 
are regulated by cell stress such as viral infection. During 
experimental AKI, the proximal tubule epithelial cells 
(TECs) upregulate the expression of an NK cell activating 
ligand, Rae-1, which promotes TEC killing by activating 
the NKG2D receptor on NK cells [19]. Th e NK cells 
utilize perforins to kill the TECs in this model and their 
numbers in the kidney are elevated as early as 4 h after 
ischemic insult [19].
Dendritic cells
Dendritic cells classifi ed by the expression of CD11c+ are 
the most abundant leukocyte subset in the normal mouse 
kidney [20] suggesting an important role in renal 
immunity and infl ammation. Upon stimulation, dendritic 
cells transform to a mature phenotype characterized by 
high levels of class II major histocompatibility complex 
(MHC class II) and co-stimulatory molecules with low 
phagocytic capacity. Mature dendritic cells are ideally 
suited to activate conventional T cells. Dendritic cells 
migrate to the renal draining lymph nodes after ischemia/
reperfusion injury and induce T cell proliferation 
suggest ing that kidney dendritic cells are vital to the 
adaptive immune response to ischemia/reperfusion injury 
[21]. Dendritic cells are also important in the innate 
immune response through several mechanisms. Th ese 
include releasing pro-infl ammatory factors, interacting 
with NKT cells via the co-stimulatory molecule, CD40, 
and presenting glycolipid to NKT cells via the CD1d 
molecule. Dong et al. demonstrated that after ischemia/
reperfusion injury, renal dendritic cells produce the pro￾infl ammatory cytokines/chemokines, TNF, IL-6, mono￾cyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-1 and RANTES (Regu￾lated on Activation, Normal T Expressed and Secreted), 
and depletion of dendritic cells prior to ischemia/
reperfusion injury signifi cantly reduced the kidney levels 
of TNF produced after ischemia/reperfusion injury [22]. 
IL-12 and IL-23 are mainly produced from activated 
dendritic cells and their downstream cytokines, IFN-γ 
and IL-17, promote macrophage activation and neutro￾phil recruitment and amplify the immune response 
following ischemic kidney injury [9]. Th e use of a 
genetically-engineered mouse in which the promoter for 
the mainly dendritic cell-specifi c surface protein, CD11c, 
drives expression of the human diphtheria toxin receptor 
(CD11c-DTR mouse) has facilitated understanding of the 
role of renal dendritic cells in experimental AKI. Recent 
studies have demonstrated that dendritic cells can 
promote or prevent injury to the kidney depending on 
the stimulus. For example, depletion of dendritic cells 
prior to ischemia/reperfusion injury reduces subsequent 
reperfusion injury and renal dysfunction [11]. On the 
other hand, depletion of dendritic cells prior to cisplatin 
exposure resulted in worse renal dysfunction and infl am￾mation [8]. Th ese fi ndings suggest that dendritic cells 
play an important role in orchestrating the immune 
response during AKI; additional studies are needed to 
understand what determines whether dendritic cells 
promote or inhibit kidney infl ammation as this informa￾tion may translate into new therapeutic strategies.
Lymphocytes
T and B cells are the major eff ector cells of the adaptive 
immune system. Recognition of antigens, presented by 
antigen-presenting cells, in the presence of suffi cient co￾stimulation, causes expansion and activation of T cells 
with a T-cell receptor specifi c for that antigen. B cells 
recognize soluble antigens through cell surface immuno￾globulin type receptors. T cell contribution to the 
pathogenesis of kidney ischemia/reperfusion injury has 
been established in diff erent mouse models lacking 
certain types of lymphocytes. In mice which lack CD4 
and CD8 T cells (nu/nu mice), kidney injury and dys￾function were signifi cantly reduced compared to

wild-type controls after ischemia/reperfusion injury and 
cisplatin induced injury [23,24]. Reconstitution of nu/nu 
mice with CD4+ T cells alone but not with CD8+ T cells 
alone restored kidney injury after ischemia/reperfusion 
injury [23] and mice lacking CD8 or CD4 T cells alone 
suff ered less kidney dysfunction after cisplatin adminis￾tration [24]. To investigate the requirement of antigen￾dependent CD4 T cell activation in ischemia/reperfusion 
injury, Satpute et al. reconstituted nu/nu mice with either 
polyclonal CD4 T cells (with a diverse array of T-cell 
receptor specifi cities) or CD4 T cells from the DO11.10 
mouse which nearly all express the same T-cell receptor, 
specifi c for a chicken ovalbumin peptide [25]. Whereas 
polyclonal T cells reconstituted injury in the T cell 
defi cient mice, DO11.10 T cells did not, unless their 
cognate antigen was co-administered with the T cells 
[25]. Th ese results suggest that antigen specifi c activation 
of CD4 T cells is important for early (within 24 h) AKI.
Th e results of B cell defi ciency in mouse models of AKI 
are not consistent. Mice lacking T and B cells (RAG-1 
KO) were protected in some studies [26,27] and in others 
had similar injury to wild-type mice [28, 29]. Defi ciency 
of B cells alone in mu MT mice conferred protection 
against ischemia/reperfusion injury in one study [30] but 
resulted in more severe renal dysfunction after ischemia/
reperfusion injury in another [31]. Th erefore, more 
studies are needed to determine the role of B cells in AKI.
Natural killer T cells
NKT cells are a unique subset of T lymphocytes with 
surface receptors and functional properties shared with 
conventional T cells and NK cells. Invariant or Type I 
NKT cells express a conserved T-cell receptor (Vα14/
Jα18 and Vβ8.2,Vβ2 or Vβ7) together with the NK cell 
marker, NK1.1. In contrast to conventional T cells, this 
invariant NKT cell T-cell receptor does not recognize 
pep tide antigens presented by MHC-class I or II; it recog￾nizes glycolipids in the context of the class I-like 
molecule, CD1d. One of the most important functions of 
NKT cells is their ability to rapidly produce large 
amounts of cytokines, including Th 1-type (IFN-γ, TNF) 
and Th 2-type (IL-4, IL-13) at the same time. Th e rapid 
response by NKT cells following activation can amplify 
and regulate the function of dendritic cells, Tregs, NK 
and B cells, as well as conventional T cells. Th e number 
of IFN-γ producing type I NKT cells in the kidney is 
signifi cantly increased by 3 hours of reperfusion after 
ischemic insult [7] and NKT cells were observed in 
kidneys of patients with acute tubular necrosis (ATN) 
[32]. Blockade of NKT cell activation with the anti-CD1d 
mAb, NKT cell depletion with an anti-NK1.1 monoclonal 
antibody in wild-type mice, or use of type I NKT cell￾defi cient mice (Jα18-/-) inhibited the accumulation of 
IFN-γ producing neutrophils after IRI and prevented 
AKI [7]. Type II NKT cells are not restricted to an 
invariant T-cell receptor but still recognize glycolipids, 
such as sulfatide. In a recent study by Yang et al. sulfatide￾activated Type II NKT cells migrated to the injured 
kidney and protected mice from ischemia/reperfusion 
injury [32]. Taken together these studies suggest that 
diff er ent types of NKT cells may play divergent roles in 
AKI.
Protective actions of regulatory T cells
Tregs make up an indispensible counter-balance to the 
pro-infl ammatory cells of the immune system. Th is 
aspect is illustrated in patients with immunodysregu la￾tion, polyendocrinopathy, enteropathy, x-linked (IPEX) 
syndrome and scurfy mice which both have devastating 
autoimmunity caused by a lack of functional Tregs [33]. 
Numerous types of Tregs have been described in the 
literature, but the most abundant are CD4+ T cells, which 
express CD25, and the Treg-specifi c transcription factor, 
FoxP3. FoxP3 suppresses the expression of pro-infl amma￾tory genes and promotes the anti-infl ammatory pheno￾type of Tregs [34]. Th e main mechanisms of suppression 
employed by Tregs include production of anti-infl am ma￾tory cytokines, such as IL-10 and transforming-growth 
factor (TGF)-β, generation of extracellular adenosine, 
direct contact-mediated inhibition of dendtritic cells 
through cell surface molecules such as lymphocyte activa￾tion gene (LAG)-3 and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 
(CTLA)-4 and several others [35, 36]. Based on the 
important contribution of the pro-infl ammatory immune 
cells to AKI discussed above we hypothesized that Tregs 
would serve to protect the kidney from infl ammation and 
injury. To test this hypothesis, Tregs were partially 
depleted from naïve wild-type mice prior to a short 
ischemic insult that was not severe enough to induce 
kidney dysfunction in control mice [37]. Reduction in 
numbers of Tregs predisposed mice to tubular necrosis, 
renal infl ammation and loss of function [37]. In other 
studies, Treg depletion prior to more severe ischemia 
also worsened renal injury measured at 72 h of reper fu￾sion [38]. Th ese results suggest that enhancement of Treg 
numbers or function may be an eff ective preventative 
therapy for AKI. Indeed, adoptive transfer of isolated 
Tregs, by i.v. injection prior to ischemia/reperfusion 
injury [37,39] or cisplatin administration [40] protected 
mice from kidney injury. Th is protection was associated 
with a reduction in infi ltrating innate immune cells and 
pro-infl ammatory gene expression in the kidney 
[37,39,40]. In the ischemia/reperfusion injury model, 
IL-10-defi cient Tregs were unable to off er any protection 
[37], suggesting that IL-10 production is an important 
mechanism for Treg-mediated protection from kidney 
injury. Two other methods of protecting the kidney, 
ischemic preconditioning [39,41] and use of FTY720 [42],

have been shown to be partially dependent on the 
presence of Tregs.
In addition to prevention of injury, Tregs also promote 
the recovery of kidney function after ischemia/reper￾fusion injury [43]. Th is eff ect was demonstrated by 
depleting Tregs after ischemic injury, which caused 
reduced renal repair and increased mortality; on the 
other hand, adoptive transfer of Tregs 24 h after ischemic 
insult accelerated the recovery of renal function in mice 
[43]. Th e eff ects on kidney recovery did not appear to be 
mediated through eff ects on infi ltrating innate immune 
cells, but were associated with increased tubular epithe￾lial cell proliferation and reduced cytokine production 
from infi ltrating T cells [43]. Th is study is important 
since it is diffi cult to detect renal injury in a timely 
manner and this suggests that manipulations to enhance 
Treg numbers or function can have benefi cial eff ects after 
injury has occurred.
Recently, a clinical trial was conducted to determine 
the safety and feasibility of ex vivo expansion of human 
Tregs for adoptive transfer into patients [44]. Th e authors 
demonstrated that it is possible to expand Tregs in vitro
and then infuse up to 3 million Tregs/kg to patients, with 
no adverse eff ects observed [44]. Although this trial was 
conducted in the study of a diff erent disease model, it 
demonstrates that Treg cells themselves may be a novel 
therapeutic strategy in humans for many diseases, 
including AKI.
Conclusion
Th e immune response to kidney damage during AKI is an 
important contributor to the prolonged lack of renal 
function and progression of kidney injury. Th is response 
is complex, involving numerous pro-infl ammatory leuko￾cytes which employ diverse eff ector mechanisms inside 
the kidney (Figure 1). Th e response also involves an anti￾infl ammatory arm that protects the kidney from sub￾threshold insults, which is mediated by Tregs and 
possibly dendritic cells in some conditions (Figure 1). In 
the future, it may be possible to prevent AKI or treat 
existing AKI by inhibiting the pro-infl ammatory immune 
response to kidney injury and/or promoting the anti￾infl ammatory response through drugs or maneuvers that 
enhance Treg action or by direct administration of Tregs 
themselves.
