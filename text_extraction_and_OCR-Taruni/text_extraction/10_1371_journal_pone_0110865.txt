Abstract
Background: The lack of early biomarkers for acute kidney injury (AKI) seriously inhibits the initiation of preventive and
therapeutic measures for this syndrome in a timely manner. We tested the hypothesis that insulin-like growth factor-binding
protein 7 (IGFBP7) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-2 (TIMP-2), both inducers of G1 cell cycle arrest, function as
early biomarkers for AKI after congenital heart surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB).
Methods: We prospectively studied 51 children undergoing cardiac surgery with CPB. Serial urine samples were analyzed for
[TIMP-2]N[IGFBP7]. The primary outcome measure was AKI defined by the pRIFLE criteria within 72 hours after surgery.
Results: 12 children (24%) developed AKI within 1.67 (SE 0.3) days after surgery. Children who developed AKI after cardiac
surgery had a significant higher urinary [TIMP-2]N[IGFBP7] as early as 4 h after the procedure, compared to children who did
not develop AKI (mean of 1.93 ((ng/ml)2
/1000) (SE 0.4) vs 0.47 ((ng/ml)2
/1000) (SE 0.1), respectively; p,0.05). Urinary [TIMP￾2]N[IGFBP7] 4 hours following surgery demonstrated an area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve of 0.85.
Sensitivity was 0.83, and specificity was 0.77 for a cutoff value of 0.70 ((ng/ml)2
/1000).
Conclusions: Urinary [TIMP-2]N[IGFBP7] represent sensitive, specific, and highly predictive early biomarkers for AKI after
surgery for congenital heart disease.

Introduction
Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common complication of
pediatric cardiac surgery and negatively impacts short- and long￾term outcomes [1–3]. Serum creatinine (SCr), the traditional
marker of renal function, does not rise appreciably before a 50%
loss in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) had occurred. Further￾more, SCr is affected by several non-renal factors. Due to
hemodilution during CPB, SCr levels do not peak until 1 to 3
days after cardiac surgery [4]. The other traditional marker of
renal function, urine output, has a low specificity after cardiac
surgery, because it is also influenced by several factors. Thus, our
ability to detect AKI early remains insufficient.
The failure of prior interventional trials to attenuate AKI after
cardiac surgery has been attributed in part to delays in the
diagnosis of AKI [5,6]. Currently, it is believed that progress in
this field is forthcoming with the availability of new biomarkers for
early and reliable prediction of AKI [7,8]. Initial human studies
demonstrate that urine tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-2
(TIMP-2) and insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 7
(IGFBP7), both inducers of G1 cell cycle arrest, are early markers
of AKI in critically ill patients [9,10]. In a recent adult study, we
also showed that TIMP-2 and IGFBP7 are elevated 24 to 48 hours
before the clinical diagnosis of cardiac surgery-associated AKI
becomes apparent [11].
In this preliminary study, we have tested the hypothesis that
urinary [TIMP-2]N[IGFBP7] can predict AKI in pediatric patients
undergoing congenital heart surgery earlier than currently used
clinical parameters. The primary end point of our study was the

development of AKI as defined by pediatric modified RIFLE
(pRIFLE) criteria [12].
Materials and Methods
Study Design
This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of
University of Mu¨nster. We used the Standards for Reporting of
Diagnostic Accuracy (STARD) statement for planning and
conducting the study and preparing the manuscript [13].
All patients ,18 years of age undergoing cardiac surgery with
cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) at our center between July 2013
and December 2013 were approached for study inclusion. Patients
with severe pre-existing renal insufficiency (SCr .2 times age￾adjusted normal range) were excluded. Written informed consent
was obtained before enrollment from the legal guardian of each
patient with assent from the patient when appropriate.
Urine samples for biomarker analysis were obtained immedi￾ately before and at 4, and 24 hours after initiation of CPB, and
stored in aliquots at 280uC. SCr was routinely measured before
surgery, immediately after surgery and at least daily in the post￾operative period.
The primary outcome was the development and severity of AKI
as defined by the pediatric modified RIFLE (pRIFLE) criteria
within 72 hours after cardiac surgery [12]. We determined
pRIFLE by calculation of estimated creatinine clearance (eCCl)
using the modified Schwartz formula [14], with ‘‘Risk’’ defined as
eCCL decrease of 25% from baseline, ‘‘Injury’’ defined as eCCl
decrease of 50%, and ‘‘Failure’’ defined as eCCl decrease of 75%
or absolute value ,35 ml/min/1.73 m2
. Complexity of surgery
was categorized according to the Risk Adjustment for Congenital
Heart Surgery 1 (RACHS-1) consensus-based scoring system [15].
Secondary outcomes included duration of mechanical ventilation,
hospital length of stay and hospital mortality.
Biomarker Measurements
Laboratory investigators were blinded to clinical outcomes.
Urine TIMP-2 and IGFBP7 were measured with the Nephro￾Check Test (Astute Medical, San Diego, CA, USA). The
NephroCheck Test is a point-of-care test which was developed
to simultaneously measure urine [TIMP-2]N[IGFBP7], whereas
[TIMP-2]N[IGFBB7] indicates the multiplication of both biomark￾ers. Urine neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) was
assayed using a human-specific commercially available ELISA
(AntibodyShop, Grusbakken, Denmark). The urine kidney injury
molecule (KIM)-1 ELISA was constructed using commercially
available reagents (R&D Systems, Inc., Minneapolis, MN).
Statistical Methods
For the primary analysis, that is the difference between the urine
[TIMP-2]*[IGFBP7] levels in patients with AKI or without AKI,
we applied a Mann-Whitney-U-test. Based on the published
results on [TIMP-2]*[IGFBP7] [9], we aimed to detect a
difference in 1 unit in [TIMP-2]*[IGFBP7] with a power of
90%. Assuming an effect size of 1, a sample size of 52 patients is
necessary. Power calculation was performed with nQuery Advisor
(Version 7). Thus, 52 patients were prospectively included in the
protocol (Figure 1).
The analysis subset included patients who had measurement of
all three biomarkers at the different time points to permit
comparisons of biomarkers. Statistical analysis was performed
using SPSS (IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 21.0.
Armonk, NY: IBM Corp.). Demographics, baseline measurements
and clinical outcomes were compared between AKI and non-AKI
patients using the Mann-Whitney-U test (continuous variables) or
x2 or Fisher’s exact tests (categorical variables) as appropriate.
To analyze the predictive power of selected biomarkers receiver
operating characteristic curves (ROC) were calculated and the
area under the ROC curve (AUC) was determined. 95%
confidence intervals (CI) were reported. The AUCs were
compared between biomarkers using the methods developed by
DeLong [16]. For selected thresholds of [TIMP2]N[IGFBP7]
sensitivities, specificities, positive predictive values (PPV) and
negative predictive values (NPV) were reported for each time
point.
To include the effect of [TIMP2]N[IGFBP7] into a time-to-AKI
model we used a cox-proportional hazard model. We model the
time until an AKI occurs in terms of hours and assume all non-AKI
patients to be censored for the analysis. For censored patients time
until censoring is calculated as time from end of surgery cardiac
surgery until end of observation (three days). At first, a clinical
model without biomarkers was estimated from the data using
relevant clinical factors. In a second step, the [TIMP2]N[IGFBP7]
level was included. To show the benefit of the extended model
(clinical model + [TIMP2]N[IGFBP7]) we report the result of the
likelihood ratio test between the two models.
Inferential statistics are intended to be exploratory (hypotheses
generating), not confirmatory, and are interpreted accordingly.
The comparison-wise type-I error rate is controlled instead of the
experiment-wise error rate. The local significance level is set to
0.05. No adjustment for multiple testing is performed.
Results
We enrolled 51 patients (Figure 1). There was no significant
difference regarding the age and baseline SCr (Table 1) between
patients who developed an AKI and who did not develop an AKI.
CPB time, duration of mechanical ventilation and hospital LOS
were similar between AKI and non-AKI groups. Baseline urinary
biomarker concentrations were not different in AKI and non-AKI
groups (Table 1).
AKI occurred in 12 (24%) of the 51 patients 1.67 (SE 0.3) days
after surgery. Patient characteristics are shown in Table 1. In
patients who developed AKI, SCr significantly increased from
0.3 mg/dl (SD 0.1) at baseline to 0.7 mg/dl (SD 0.2) two days
after surgery, whereas SCr in patients who did not develop AKI
remained unchanged (Figure 2A). Among AKI patients, 10

patients developed pRIFLE-R, 2 patients developed pRIFLE-I,
and none of the patients developed pRIFLE-F.
In the 39 patients who never developed AKI, a significant
decrease in urinary [TIMP-2]N[IGFBP7] level after CPB was
noted as compared to the preoperative measurement (p,0.01;
Figure 2B). By contrast, those who subsequently developed AKI
had a striking rise in urinary [TIMP-2]N[IGFBP7] level 4 h after
the procedure as compared to the pre-CPB values (Figure 2B).
The pattern of urinary [TIMP-2]N[IGFBP7] excretion was
characterized by a peak very early after the precipitating event
followed by a strong decrease (Figure 2B). The neutrophil
gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) concentration in the urine
of patients who developed an AKI significantly increased 4 hours
after surgery followed by a sharp decrease (Figure 2C), whereas
kidney injury molecule (KIM)-1 in the urine significantly increased
at a later time point (Figure 2D).
In our study population, baseline [TIMP-2]N[IGFBP7] levels
were not elevated in patients with either immature kidneys (,2
years) or venous congestion resulting from congenital heart disease
(data not shown), suggesting that [TIMP-2]N[IGFBP7] serves as a
marker of acute injury to the kidney after cardiac surgery with
CPB.
For urine [TIMP-2]N[IGFBP7], the area under the ROC curve
was 0.85 (CI: 0.72–0.94) at 4 h after CPB (Figure 3A), the area
under the ROC curve for urine NGAL was 0.87 (CI: 0.74–0.95)
(Figure 3B), and the area under the ROC curve for urine KIM-1
was 0.64 (CI: 0.49–0.77) (Figure 3B). Furthermore, the AUCs of
biomarkers were compared. There was no significant difference
between the AUC of NGAL and [TIMP2]N[IGFBP7] (p = 0.8549).
The AUCs of [TIMP2]N[IGFBP7] and NGAL were significant
higher compared to the AUC of KIM-1 ([TIMP2]N[IGFBP7] vs
KIM-1: p = 0.0326, NGAL vs KIM-1: p = 0.0280) (Figure 3B).
Table 2 lists the derived sensitivities, specificities, and predictive
values at different cutoff concentrations. For urine [TIMP￾2]N[IGFBP7], a cutoff of 0.7 yielded good sensitivity and specificity
at 4 h after CPB.
We also tested whether [TIMP-2]N[IGFBP7] increases predic￾tive ability over common clinical variables. [TIMP-2]N[IGFBP7]
significantly strengthened risk prediction when added to a seven￾parameter clinical model for our primary endpoint using time-to￾event analysis (Table 3). This analysis showed significant enhance￾ment by the addition of [TIMP-2]N[IGFBP7] with [TIMP￾2]N[IGFBP7] remaining strongly associated with AKI in this
model.
Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the first study investigating [TIMP￾2]N[IGFBP7] as early predictive biomarker of cardiac-surgery
associated AKI in children with congenital heart disease (CHD).
In our preliminary study, we show that [TIMP-2]N[IGFBP7] levels
and NGAL levels increase as early as 4 h after CPB in children
who will later develop AKI but not in those who will not develop
AKI. AUCs above 0.85 indicate a better performance than other
new biomarkers.

Several molecules are involved in the pathogenesis of AKI
[17,18]. IGFBP7 and TIMP-2 are two molecules which may
induce G1 cell cycle arrest, a mechanism involved in the early
phase of AKI [19,20]. After stress, cell damage or injury, renal
tubular cells enter for a short period G1 cell-cycle arrest [21] until
the damage has been repaired [22]. Importantly, TIMP-2 and
IGFBP7 are able to signal in an autocrine as well as paracrine
fashion [23–27] and thus spread the ‘alarm-signal’ from the site of
cell injury. Cell cycle arrest happens early after a variety of insults
[20]. This may explain the early increase of these two molecules in
the urine of patients who develop AKI after cardiac surgery.
Compared to adult patients at high risk for AKI undergoing
cardiac surgery [11], pediatric patients display higher baseline
urinary [TIMP-2]N[IGFBP7] concentrations, an observation that
can hardly be explained by either immaturity of childrens’ kidneys
or venous congestion in consequence of CHD. Apart from
immaturity and venous congestion preoperative fasting may play a
decisive role, as it provokes preoperative dehydration with reduced
kidney perfusion. Although we did not find a significant difference
in perioperative fasting between the two groups, this hypothesis
has to be tested in further larger studies. Other biomarkers which
have been scrutinized in the setting of CHD (e.g. KIM-1 and
NGAL) do not change in non-AKI children [28]. However,
contrary to expectations [TIMP-2]N[IGFBP7] levels decrease after
surgery in these children. This decline may suggest that CHD is
uniformly associated with a certain degree of kidney injury.
Against this background, to test urinary [TIMP-2]N[IGFBP7]
seems to provide the best means to diagnose and follow kidney
dysfunction in the wake of CHD and surgery.
Our study has limitations. In a single center study, we merely
looked at a small number of patients out of the broad spectrum of
CHD. Although some parameters (e.g. CPB time, duration of
mechanical ventilation and hospital length of stay) were not
statistically significant between the groups, it is possible that there
are differences, but we could not detect them because of the small
sample size. The same may be true for the missing difference in the
baseline [TIMP-2]N[IGFBP7] levels in patients with either
immature kidneys (,2 years) or venous congestion resulting from
congenital heart disease. For the clinical model we selected factors
that are normally associated with the occurrence of AKI.

However, in this study these factors were not associated with the
occurrence of AKI. The reason for this might be the small sample
size. The results of this pilot study have to be confirmed in a larger
study. Further thorough study is needed to more clearly delineate
the interactions between kidney dysfunction and specific congen￾ital cardiac lesions on the one hand and the respective
performance of biomarkers on the other hand.
In summary, our preliminary study indicates that [TIMP￾2]N[IGFBP7] has the potential to become a highly useful
biomarker to early predict AKI in children undergoing cardiac
surgery.
