Abstract
Introduction: Long-term ventilated intensive care patients frequently require tracheostomy. Although overall risks
are low, serious immediate and late complications still arise. Real-time ultrasound guidance has been proposed to
decrease complications and improve the accuracy of the tracheal puncture. We aimed to compare the procedural
safety and efficacy of real-time ultrasound guidance with the traditional landmark approach during percutaneous
dilatational tracheostomy (PDT).
Methods: A total of 50 patients undergoing PDT for clinical indications were randomly assigned, after obtaining
informed consent, to have the tracheal puncture procedure carried out using either traditional anatomical landmarks
or real-time ultrasound guidance. Puncture position was recorded via bronchoscopy. Blinded assessors determined in a
standardised fashion the deviation of the puncture off midline and whether appropriate longitudinal position between
the first and fourth tracheal rings was achieved. Procedural safety and efficacy data, including complications and number
of puncture attempts required, were collected.
Results: In total, 47 data sets were evaluable. Real-time ultrasound guidance resulted in significantly more accurate
tracheal puncture. Mean deviation from midline was 15 ± 3° versus 35 ± 5° (P = 0.001). The proportion of appropriate
punctures, defined a priori as 0 ± 30° from midline, was significantly higher: 20 (87%) of 23 versus 12 (50%) of 24
(RR = 1.74; 95% CI = 1.13 to 2.67; P = 0.006). First-pass success rate was 20 (87%) of 23 in the ultrasound group and
14 (58%) of 24 in the landmark group (RR = 1.49; 95% CI = 1.03 to 2.17; P = 0.028). The observed decrease in procedural
complications was not statistically significant: 5 (22%) of 23 in the ultrasound group versus 9 (37%) of 24 in the landmark
group (RR = 0.58; 95% CI = 0.23 to 1.47; P = 0.24).
Conclusions: Ultrasound guidance significantly improved the rate of first-pass puncture and puncture accuracy. Fewer
procedural complications were observed; however, this did not reach statistical significance. These results support wider
general use of real-time ultrasound guidance as an additional tool to improve PDT.

Introduction
Patients in intensive care frequently receive tracheostomy
for long-term ventilator support. Percutaneous dilatational
tracheostomy (PDT) has established advantages and is the
preferred method over surgical tracheostomy [1], which is
now reserved for select cases. Although overall complication
rates are low, PDT remains one of the few procedures
routinely undertaken in intensive care where significant
adverse events, including death, are still reported [2-5].
With the increasing availability of bedside ultrasonography
in the intensive care setting, preprocedural and real-time
intraprocedural ultrasound guidance have been advocated
as potential tools to further improve the safety and efficacy
of the procedure [6,7].
Despite an increasing number of publications in the re￾cent literature describing favourable results and advocating
the use of ultrasound for PDT [8,9], there is a paucity of
high-quality evidence. A recent systematic review failed to
identify any randomised controlled trials in support of this
modality [10]. To answer the question whether using
real-time ultrasound guidance improves the procedural
safety and efficacy of tracheal puncture, we conducted a
prospective randomised controlled trial comparing this
novel approach to the landmark method in adult intensive
care patients requiring PDT.
Methods
Trial design
The TARGET Study (Traditional landmArk versus
ultRasound Guided Evaluation Trial) was a prospective
randomised controlled trial carried out at two participat￾ing sites: Royal Prince Alfred Hospital and Nepean
Hospital in Sydney, Australia. The aim of the study was
to compare the use of real-time ultrasound guidance to
landmark-guided tracheal puncture during PDT. The
primary outcome measure was the accuracy of tracheal
puncture, defined as less than 30° deviation from midline
and appropriate longitudinal puncture between the first
and fourth tracheal rings. A secondary measure of effi￾cacy was the first-pass success rate. Studied measures of
safety were periprocedural and intermediate-term com￾plication rates.
Sample size
Lacking published data, we estimated the degree of
malposition to calculate sample size requirements.
Presuming an average displacement of 25° from mid￾line in the landmark group and 15° in the ultrasound
group with 15° and 10° respective standard deviations,
we estimated that a sample size of 50 would be re￾quired to detect a statistically significant difference
with a 0.05 confidence interval and statistical power
over 80%.
Participants and enrolment
Ethical approval was obtained for both participating sites
(see Acknowledgements), and the trial is registered with
the Australia and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry
(ACTRN12611000237987). Eligible adult intensive care
patients were defined as being older than 18 years of age
at the time of enrolment and requiring a percutaneous
dilatational tracheostomy for clinical reasons, with the
only exclusion criterion being pregnancy. Patients were
unable to provide consent; therefore, in accordance with
the ethical approval, informed consent was obtained
from the person responsible prior to study enrolment.
As set out by New South Wales health policy, the person
responsible was most commonly an enduring guardian,
a spouse or another close relative. Patients were randomised
in a 1:1 ratio to the intervention and control arms
using permuted blocks of four and six, and allocation
concealment was maintained by using sequentially
numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes created according
to published recommendations [11]. An independent
member of the research team who was not directly
involved with the study in any other capacity created
the randomisation sequence using a computer algorithm
[12] and prepared and sealed the envelopes. Once consent
was obtained, patients were enrolled by selecting the
topmost sequentially numbered envelope, which contained
the study group allocation.
Interventions
Patients in both groups underwent a standard PDT using
the Ciaglia single tapered dilator technique [13] using
the Ciaglia Blue Rhino kit (Cook Medical, Bloomington,
IN, USA). Percutaneous tracheal needle puncture was
followed by insertion of a guidewire, use of the tapered
dilator to create the tract and insertion of the tracheostomy
tube. The study intervention was use of real-time ultra￾sound guidance to guide the tracheal needle puncture. A
Sonosite M-Turbo portable ultrasound machine (FUJIFILM
SonoSite, Bothell, WA, USA) or a Siemens Acuson Cypress
portable ultrasound machine (Siemens, Munich, Germany)
was used with 5-MHz linear transducers and sterile
ultrasound probe covers (Bard Access Systems, Salt
Lake City, UT, USA). A midline longitudinal probe
position was used to identify the cricoid and tracheal
rings in cross-section, thereby allowing us to deter￾mine the required level of puncture, ideally between
the first and fourth tracheal rings. This was followed
by scanning the neck in a transverse probe position
and identifying the thyroid and cricoid cartilages, tracheal
rings, thyroid gland and isthmus, and the carotid and
jugular vessels bilaterally. If significant midline vascular
structures were noted, the planned puncture position was
modified accordingly. Tracheal puncture was carried out
using a previously described transverse probe position and

real-time out-of-plane technique [7]. An additional movie
file depicts the procedure in more detail (see Additional
file 1). Printed pamphlets with normal ultrasound anat￾omy in the longitudinal and transverse planes and a de￾scription of the study procedure were available for
reference. In the control arm, palpation of anatomical
landmarks was used to carry out the tracheal puncture,
which is normal practice at the participating institutions.
Mandatory bronchoscopy using Pentax EPK-1000 (Pentax
Medical, Montvale NJ, USA) or Olympus (Olympus
America, Center Valley, PA, USA) video bronchoscopes
was carried out after guidewire insertion to confirm intra￾luminal position before dilation and to document the
puncture position for analysis. Bronchoscopy had to take
place only after the guidewire was inserted. Bronchoscopy
during needle puncture is not considered standard prac￾tice in either of the participating units and was not per￾mitted in the study protocol. The analogue video output
from the bronchoscope tower was captured with a Black￾Magic analogue-to-digital video converter (BlackMagic
Design, Fremont, CA, USA) to record the full duration of
the bronchoscopy from insertion of the bronchoscope into
the endotracheal tube until its removal. Video was re￾corded using an Apple MacBook Pro laptop computer
(Apple, Cupertino, CA, USA) and BlackMagic video re￾cording software (BlackMagic Design). Dilation of the
tract and insertion of the tracheostomy tube were carried
out in both groups as per normal practice. All procedures
were carried out by intensive care specialists or supervised
senior trainees in intensive care medicine, which is con￾sistent with current Australian practice. All proceduralists
were familiar with the landmark approach, but had vary￾ing experience with the ultrasound-guided technique. To
capture a representative group of clinicians, no procedur￾alists were excluded, as long as they were willing to learn
and perform both the study and control procedures.
Data collection and outcome measures
We collected baseline demographic data and severity of
illness indicators (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health
Evaluation II on admission and Sequential Organ Failure
Assessment scores on the day prior to tracheostomy)
(Table 1). Data collected during and immediately after
the procedure included number of passes, with subse￾quent passes defined by the need to withdraw the needle
completely from the skin and reinsert it, and immediate
periprocedural complications, defined as complications
arising during the procedure or during the following
1 hour (Table 2). A postinsertion anteroposterior mobile
chest radiograph was mandatory, and any complications
such as pneumothorax were noted. Video acquired dur￾ing bronchoscopy was recorded as described above.
Follow-up of the patients was carried out until day 90
or decannulation, whichever occurred first. Time to
wean from the ventilator, ICU length of stay and time to
decannulation were recorded. Any tracheostomy-related
adverse events during the follow-up period were docu￾mented (Table 2).
Data analysis
The primary outcome measures of accurate craniocaudal
positioning and midline deviation of the tracheal puncture
were derived from the bronchoscopic recordings by two
blinded assessors with extensive clinical experience in
bronchoscopy and percutaneous tracheostomy insertion.
Still images showing the entire tracheal lumen and the
guidewire entering the trachea were taken from the video
recordings. Images were scaled up or down to standardise
the tracheal lumen size at the level of the guidewire entry
(10 cm in transverse diameter) to allow uniform assessment.
Aspect ratios were maintained, and there was no additional
postprocessing of images. The two blinded assessors used
an Apple iPad (Apple) with preloaded images and a
standard translucent 360° protractor (Cellco, China).
The geometric anterior tracheal midline was defined
by aligning the protractor with the anterior curve of
the trachea at the level of the puncture and aligning
the transverse axis with the posterior tracheal wall. Using
the aligned protractor, we recorded the deviation from the
midline in degrees (Figure 1). This step was followed by
determination of the craniocaudal position, based on the
bronchoscopic images. This was deemed either appropri￾ate, too caudal or too cranial, depending on whether

the puncture site was between the first and fourth
tracheal rings or above or below these, respectively.
The complete bronchoscopic video recordings were
also available for the assessors to review on the tablet
device. If there was a greater than 10° disagreement
between the assessors or there was disagreement in
terms of craniocaudal positioning, they were asked to
review the images in question together to form a con￾sensus. All statistical analyses were carried out using
Prism for Mac OS X v6.0 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla,
CA, USA). Deviation from the midline was assessed
using an unpaired t-test. Deviation was also analysed
with dichotomised data, a priori defining midline ±30°
as appropriate and deviation beyond this level as
inappropriate. Evaluation of the above data, along
with assessment of longitudinal placement and number of
multiple-pass instances between the groups, was evaluated
using a χ2 test.
Results
During the course of the 11-month recruitment period
between August 2011 and July 2012, there were 72
eligible patients, from among whom 55 were screened
and 50 were enrolled, with 25 patients in each group
(Figure 2). No patient met the exclusion criteria, and no
patient was deemed to require a surgical tracheostomy. No
patient was found to have significant aberrant pretracheal
vasculature in the ultrasound group. The groups were
similar at baseline (Table 1). One patient had undergone
recent cervical spine surgery, and two patients had
previous tracheostomy scars. Twenty-four patients in
each group received the allocated intervention. One
patient in the landmark group died after randomisation
and before the tracheostomy was performed, and one
person in the ultrasound group made an unexpected
recovery after randomisation and could be extubated
without the need for tracheostomy. Procedural data
were missing for one patient in the ultrasound group
because of a protocol violation, resulting in no recording
being made. Follow-up data were complete for all but one
patient in the landmark group, who was lost to follow-up
after transfer to another institution and therefore the final
decannulation date is unknown. All data were analysed
according to intention to treat.
In both groups, one-third of the procedures were
carried out by intensive care specialists and the remainder
by senior trainees under supervision. Mean midline
deviation in the ultrasound and landmark groups was
15 ± 3° versus 35 ± 5° (P = 0.001), with a difference of
20 ± 6° (95% CI = 8.0 to 31.8). Appropriate midline
puncture, defined a priori as the anterior one-third of
the tracheal ring, or midline ±30°, was achieved in 20
(87%) of 23 patients in the ultrasound and 12 (50%)
of 24 patients in the landmark group (RR = 1.74; 95%

CI = 1.13 to 2.67; P = 0.006). Appropriate longitudinal
placement was achieved in 21 (95%) of 22 in the
ultrasound and in 21 (95%) of 22 in the landmark
group (RR = 1.00; 95% CI = 0.88 to 1.14; P = 1.00).
Longitudinal position could not be determined, owing
to severe tracheitis in two patients in the landmark
group and one patient in the ultrasound group. First-pass
success rate was 20 (87%) of 23 in the ultrasound group
and 14 (58%) of 24 in the landmark group (RR = 1.49; 95%
CI = 1.03 to 2.17; P = 0.028). Reduction in complication
rate was not statistically significant: 5 (22%) of 23 in
the ultrasound group compared to 9 (37%) of 24 in
the landmark group (RR = 0.58; 95% CI = 0.23 to 1.47;
P = 0.24). Discounting ‘minor bleeding not requiring
intervention’, the complication rates were 2 (9%) of 23
in the ultrasound group and 2 (8%) of 24 in the land￾mark group, which are comparable to those reported
in the literature. One accidental decannulation and one
pressure ulcer were noted in the ultrasound group
during the follow-up period. There were no serious
intermediate-term complications (Table 2). There were
four deaths in each group, all related to the underlying
disease process.
Discussion
Ultrasound guidance significantly improved the rate of
first-pass puncture and puncture accuracy.
The ultrasonographic anatomy of the anterior neck
prior to tracheostomy was first described in 1995 [14],
and a report of real-time ultrasound-guided puncture for
PDT was first published in 1999 [15]. Two-dimensional
ultrasound using a linear array probe readily identifies the
position and anatomical relation of important landmarks.
These include the thyroid and cricoid cartilage, the
tracheal rings, the thyroid gland and the carotid and
jugular vessels (Figures 3a and 3b). Aberrant vascular
structures crossing the midline can further be evaluated
by colour or spectral Doppler. Real-time imaging can be
used to identify the desired level of puncture in a sagittal
plane in the midline over the trachea, and a 90° rotation of
the probe allows for an out-of-plane approach to guiding
the needle (represented by an acoustic shadow) towards
the midline. Care should be taken because the needle
must enter the trachea almost directly below the puncture
site, making the angle of insonation of the needle
low, resulting in potential difficulties in identifying
and discerning the needle tip from the shaft. Indirect

ultrasonographic signs of the needle advancement, such as
indentation of the tissues, can be used as additional guid￾ance to direct the needle towards the anterior tracheal
midline (see movie file in Additional file 1).
The theoretical advantage of using preprocedural ultra￾sound lies with the ability to identify aberrant pretracheal
vasculature to avoid immediate vascular complications [6].
It may also aid in proper selection of tracheostomy tube
size and length, especially in patients with an increased
pretracheal soft-tissue diameter or in children [16].
Intraprocedural ultrasound may assist not only with
identifying the tracheal anatomy and potentially aberrant
vessels but also with identifying the preferred puncture
location and guiding the needle puncture of the trachea in
real time, not dissimilar to the technique routinely used in
ultrasound-guided vascular access.
It is common for patients receiving a tracheostomy to
have anatomy that is considered ‘difficult’. This is most
often due to obesity or to deformity from chronic
musculoskeletal pathology or prior injuries and surgical
procedures. The difficulties encountered in locating land￾marks such as the cricothyroid membrane and difficulties
with tracheal puncture when the tracheal anatomy is not
readily palpable have been highlighted in multiple recent
studies, both in real patients and on simulated models
[17,18]. Ultrasound has been successfully used in
simulated models and difficult clinical cases to guide
the tracheal puncture [19,20].
The finding that real-time ultrasound-guided tracheal
puncture has a significantly higher first-pass success rate
has important implications, not only in elective surgery
but also in emergency airway procedures. A number of
currently used percutaneous emergency airway devices
rely on tracheal puncture, and as these are reserved
for ‘can’t intubate, can’t ventilate’ scenarios, rapid and
reliable access to the airway in these circumstances is
of paramount importance.
To date, there have been no studies in which investigators
have reported the incidence and degree of inappropriately
positioned tracheal punctures. To our knowledge, we are
the first group to highlight this common occurrence during
tracheal puncture guided by landmark anatomy. The extent
to which deviation from the midline will influence the
development of complications, either in the periprocedural

setting or later on, is also unknown. Vascular complications
are relatively easy to detect, but it is difficult to quantify
their severity. Demonstration of the true incidence of long￾term complications such as tracheal stenosis is difficult and
often considered impossible in a study cohort, owing to the
nature of the investigations required (for example, com￾puted tomography or endoscopy). The rarity of serious or
fatal complications makes a study powered to detect a sig￾nificant difference in this regard impractical. However,
there are plausible theoretical grounds and a large amount
of observational data in the literature suggesting that
multiple complications can potentially be avoided by an
appropriately positioned tracheal puncture.
There can be little doubt that a significant proportion of
serious complications in the immediate periprocedural
setting relates to unanticipated anatomical variation in the
vasculature [4]. Ultrasound has a sound theoretical benefit
in this setting, and a number of authors have reported
changing the planned puncture location based on ultra￾sound findings in up to as many as 50% of their patients
[21-23]. During dilation of the tract, laterally positioned
punctures also change the force vectors resulting from
applying downward pressure onto an oblique section of
the anterolateral trachea. A significant amount of force
can thus be directed parallel rather than perpendicular to
the tracheal wall (Figures 4 and 5). This can be particularly
dangerous, as it predisposes to bending of the guidewire
and subsequent paratracheal dilatation of the tract, or
tearing of the tracheal wall by the dilator itself. An
appropriately positioned midline puncture can potentially
prevent these complications.
The development of late complications can also be
influenced by initial tracheostomy tube position. Published
cases of serious late bleeding complications have often
arisen in the setting of very laterally or caudally placed
tracheostomy tubes, which eventually eroded into vascular
structures [5]. Other long-term complications, such as
tracheal stenosis and intermittent tracheostomy tube
obstruction contributing to failed ventilator wean, have
also been reported as consequences of inappropriate
tracheostomy tube position [24-26]. Appropriate midline
and longitudinal puncture position can therefore also have
implications in reducing late complication rates.
In summary, although this study was not powered to de￾tect a difference in the rate of complications, there is suffi￾cient evidence in the literature to support a link between
appropriate tracheal puncture position and decreased
complication rates, both in the immediate procedural set￾ting and in the long term.
We conducted a prospective randomised controlled trial
to study the utilisation of real-time ultrasound to guide
tracheal puncture during PDT in a representative cohort
of general adult intensive care patients. Ultrasound is gen￾erally available in ICUs, and many consider real-time
ultrasound mandatory for certain procedures, including
central venous cannulation and thoracocentesis. It was
therefore reasonable to study the use of real-time ultra￾sound to guide tracheal puncture during PDT, as this
technique can be broadly generalised.
Strengths and limitations
The strengths of the study include prospective ran￾domisation, strict maintenance of allocation conceal￾ment, blinded assessment of primary outcome data,
limited exclusion criteria and a high percentage of capture
of eligible patients during the study period. Pragmatic
inclusion of a representative cohort of proceduralists with
various levels of expertise and training makes the data
generalizable beyond the involved institutions. The
endpoints were clearly defined, simple and clinically
relevant, and data were analysed using straightforward
statistical methods.
Potential limitations of the study include an operator
skill mix biased towards the landmark technique, in
Figure 4 Bronchoscopic views. Appropriately positioned tracheal puncture (a) and an example of extremely lateral puncture with potential for
complications (b). The asterisks mark the anterior tracheal midline.

which most operators had significantly more experience
compared to the ultrasound technique. This may have
led to an underestimation of the effect size. We exam￾ined the use of a strict percutaneous tracheal puncture
technique which may not be the method of choice in all
institutions. The possible additional utility of ultrasound
guidance is unclear if deep dissection is performed be￾fore the tracheal puncture or if bronchoscopy is used
during the needle puncture to guide the needle. The
number of puncture attempts was self-reported, and
some procedural complications, such as ‘minor bleeding
not requiring intervention’, are difficult to define and can
be subjective. Serious adverse events are rare, and poten￾tial differences in length of ventilation or intensive care
stay are likely to be small; therefore, this study was not
powered to demonstrate a difference in these outcome
measures. Craniocaudal placement of the tracheal punc￾ture was difficult or impossible to determine in a small
number of cases, such as in patients with significant tra￾cheitis. There was a small apparent difference in baseline
body mass index between the two groups, and although
it has been demonstrated that morbid obesity does not
influence the safety or efficacy of PDT when ultrasound
is used [23], there are no reports in the literature to date
describing whether a difference exists when the land￾mark technique is utilised. The potentially incremental
benefit of ultrasound over the landmark technique in
the morbidly obese remains to be investigated.
Conclusions
Ultrasound-guided tracheal puncture, in comparison
to the landmark technique, is more efficient and is
associated with a significantly higher first-pass suc￾cess rate. Ultrasound-guided puncture is also more
accurate than the landmark technique and results in
a significantly higher rate of appropriate midline punc￾tures. Fewer procedural complications were observed
in the ultrasound group; however, this difference did
not reach statistical significance. The present data
support wider routine use of real-time ultrasound
guidance for tracheal puncture during percutaneous
tracheostomy.
Key messages
 Real-time ultrasound guidance improves the
accuracy of tracheal needle puncture during PDT,
thereby potentially decreasing both short- and
long-term complication rates.
 Real-time ultrasound guidance improves the
first-pass success rate of tracheal needle puncture
during PDT, highlighting its potential utility during
time-critical airway procedures.
 Fewer procedural complications were observed with
the use of ultrasound guidance; however, this study
was not powered to detect a statistically significant
difference.
Figure 5 Risk associated with lateral tracheal puncture. Downward force (dashed black arrow) applied during dilation of the tract can be
broken up into force vectors which are perpendicular (blue arrow) and parallel (red arrow) to the tracheal wall (black line). At a 90° angle, all of
the force is perpendicular. With the angle becoming more oblique, hitting the lateral curve of the tracheal wall, there is an increasing proportion
of the downward force which is parallel to the wall and a decreasing proportion directed towards the tracheal lumen. This can lead to bending
of the guidewire and subsequent paratracheal tract dilation or tearing of the tracheal wall itself.

accompanying images. A copy of the written consent is
available for review by the Editor-in-Chief of this journal.
Additional file
Additional file 1: Ultrasound anatomy of the neck and real-time,
ultrasound-guided tracheal puncture. The panoramic ultrasound
images demonstrate the ultrasound anatomy of the neck in relation to
performing a percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy. In the transverse
view one can identify the tracheal cartilage (yellow), thyroid gland
(orange) and carotid and jugular vessels (red and blue respectively).
Rotating the probe 90 degrees yields a longitudinal view where the
thyroid, cricoid and tracheal ring cartilages (yellow) are identified in cross
section. During the procedure a longitudinal view allows identification of
the cricoid and tracheal rings (yellow) and the desired puncture level
between the 1st and 4th tracheal rings. Rotation to 90 degrees and
scanning cranially and caudally allows for visualisation of potential
aberrant midline vascular structures as well as identification of important
landmarks such as the thyroid cartilage and vocal cords (yellow, blue),
the cricoid cartilage (yellow) and the tracheal rings with the thyroid
gland and isthmus lying anteriorly (yellow, orange). The needle path is
visualised in real time represented by an acoustic shadow. Indentation of
the tracheal ring by the needle tip can also be observed. Penetration of
the tracheal lumen can be confirmed by demonstrating air escaping
through the cannula. The guide wire is inserted and after bronchoscopic
confirmation of intraluminal placement dilation of the tract and insertion
of the tracheostomy tube follows as per standard procedure. Footnote:
