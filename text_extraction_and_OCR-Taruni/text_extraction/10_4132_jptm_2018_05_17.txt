Primary combined hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and neuroendocrine carcinoma is a rare entity, 
and so is hypercalcemia due to ectopic parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion by tumor. A 44-year 
old man with hepatitis B virus associated chronic liver disease presented with a hepatic mass. 
Hemihepatectomy discovered the mass as combined HCC and poorly differentiated cholangio￾carcinoma. During adjuvant chemoradiation therapy, he presented with nausea, and multiple sys￾temic metastases were found. Laboratory tests revealed hypercalcemia with markedly elevated 
PTH and neuron specific enolase. Parathyroid scan showed normal uptake in parathyroid glands, 
suggestive of ectopic PTH secretion. Subsequently, immunohistochemistry of neuroendocrine 
marker was performed on the primary lesion, and confirmed the neuroendocrine differentiation in 
non-HCC component. The patient died 71 days after surgery. This report may suggest the possibility 
of ectopic PTH secretion by neuroendocrine carcinoma of hepatic origin causing hypercalcemia. 
Caution for neuroendocrine differentiation should be exercised when diagnosing poorly differenti￾ated HCC.

▒ CASE STUDY ▒
Primary neuroendocrine carcinoma (NEC) in the liver is a 
rare entity that behaves aggressively. Primary hepatocellular 
carcinoma (HCC) with a NEC component is very rare, consisting 
of about 0.46% of primary hepatic tumors.1
 Eighteen cases of 
primary combined or collided NEC and HCC have been reported 
in English literature to this date.1-14 None of these cases had 
paraneoplastic syndromes or proved to be functional. 
Hypercalcemia is a well-known paraneoplastic metabolic condi￾tion associated with many malignancies.15 In HCC, hypercalcemia 
accounts for 7.8% of the paraneoplastic syndromes.16 While 
primary hyperparathyroidism is the most common cause for 
hypercalcemia without malignancies, hypercalcemia can occur 
in association with malignancies through other mechanisms. 
Most of the malignancies associated with hypercalcemia proved 
to be caused by parathyroid hormone (PTH)–related peptide 
(PTHrP).17 Metastasis of the malignancies to the bone can also 
cause osteolysis leading to hypercalcemia.17 Only rare cases are 
considered to be a result of ectopic PTH production by the tumors.
Here, we present a rare case of combined hepatic NEC and 
HCC with malignancy associated hypercalcemia caused by ectopic 
PTH production. Previously reported primary mixed HCC and 
NEC cases and ectopic PTH-producing HCC cases are also 
summarized and discussed.
CASE REPORT
A 44-year-old man presented with a hepatic mass discovered 
during a regular abdominal ultrasound for hepatitis B virus asso￾ciated chronic liver disease. The chronic liver disease was diag￾nosed 9 years ago and the patient was on Tenofovir. Laboratory 
findings showed elevated white blood cells (17,000/μL), mildly 
elevated aspartate aminotransferase (4 IU/L), alanine transami￾nase (22 IU/L), and normal calcium and phosphate levels. Com￾puted tomographic scan identified one huge mass in segment

(S) 8 and the other small mass in S6, with thrombi in right portal 
and hepatic veins. No other systemic lesion was found. The patient 
underwent right hemihepatectomy with partial diaphragm resec￾tion and lymph node dissection. 
On pathological examination, the cut section of S8 revealed a 
yellow-whitish mass measuring 10.5×8.0 with irregular margins 
and necrosis. The mass in S6 was a yellowish multinodular 
mass that measured 1.3×1.0. Tumor thrombosis was noted in 
the right portal vein, and cirrhosis was observed in the non￾neoplastic liver. Histologically, the main mass in S8 consisted of 
two components; a dominant poorly differentiated carcinoma 
component (60%) composed of small tumor cells with enlarged 
vesicular irregular nuclei, high nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio, large 
nucleoli, and frequent mitoses, and multiple foci of typical HCC 
component (40%) showing trabecular architecture and grade 
2 nuclei (Fig. 1). The tumor penetrated the Glisson’s capsule 
directly invading the diaphragm and showed extensive necrosis 
and microvessel invasion. The poorly differentiated carcinoma 
component was focally positive for cytokeratin (CK) 7 and negative 
for α-fetoprotein, hepatocyte, glypican-3, and CK19 immuno￾histochemistry, and was interpreted as poorly differentiated 
cholangiocarcinoma component. The pathologic diagnosis of S8 
mass was combined HCC and cholangiocarcinoma. The other 
mass in S6 showed typical histologic features of HCC. There 
was no metastasis in 22 lymph nodes.
The patient subsequently received adjuvant concurrent chemo￾radiation therapy (CCRT) of one cycle of 5-flourouracil chemo￾therapy and two cycles of 5 fx radiation. On postoperative day 
59, he visited the emergency room for nausea and vomiting. 
Laboratory results showed elevated levels of total calcium (13.2 
mg/dL; normal range, 8.8 to 10.5), ionized calcium (2.3 mmol/
L; normal range, 1.05 to 1.35), blood urea nitrogen (33 mg/dL; 
normal range, 10 to 26), and creatinine (2.16 mg/dL; normal 
range, 0.7 to 1.4) with normal to low levels of phosphate. Further 
evaluation of hypercalcemia revealed markedly increased PTH 
(3,859 by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; normal range, 
15 to 65), and neuron-specific enolase (101.04 ng/mL; normal 
range, 0 to 16.3). Parathyroid scan was performed to exclude 
primary hyperparathyroidism, which showed no abnormality. 
Whole body positron emission tomography revealed multiple 
hypermetabolic lesions in the liver and whole skeleton, and biopsy 
of an osteolytic lesion involving a left rib discovered metastatic 
poorly differentiated carcinoma. Only the poorly differentiated 
carcinoma component, not the HCC component, was identified in 
the metastatic lesion. Regarding hypercalcemia, elevated PTH 
could not be explained with bone metastasis or PTHrP, and hyper￾calcemia persisted despite management. Finally, ectopic PTH 
production by the tumor was suggested as the cause of hyper￾calcemia.
Meanwhile, the clinician in charge enquired to the pathologist 
of the presence of NEC component in the tumor based on the 
possibility that ectopic hormone could be secreted by NEC, the 
rapid progression of the tumor and the elevated neuron-specific 
enolase level. Subsequent immunohistochemistry of neuroendo￾crine markers and PTH were performed on both primary (S8 
mass) and metastatic tumor specimens. CD56 stained positive 
while chromogranin and synaptophysin were focally positive in the 
poorly differentiated area on both specimens, implying neuroen￾docrine differentiation (Fig. 2). The component with typical HCC 
morphology was negative for all three markers (Fig. 2). There 
was no immunoreactivity for PTH on either specimen. Symp￾tomatic treatment including continuous renal replacement therapy 
was applied for the acute renal failure induced by hypercalcemia. 
However, the patient expired of disease progression 2 months 
after diagnosis.
This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of 
Seoul National University Bundang Hospital (IRB No. B-1801-
442-702), and patient consent was waived.
DISCUSSION
Primary combined HCC and NEC is very rare. The initial 
pathologic diagnosis of this case was combined HCC and cholan￾giocarcinoma because its poorly differentiated component bore 
little resemblance to typical NEC morphology. However, with 
clinical suspicion, immunohistochemistry revealed multifocal 
areas within the poorly differentiated component that stained 
positive for neuroendocrine markers. Therefore, we classified it as 
combined HCC and NEC.
The clinical characteristics of the 18 reported cases of primary 
Fig. 1. Representative histologic image of the main hepatic mass. mixed HCC and NEC are summarized in Table 1. Most cases

were associated with chronic hepatitis B or C. The reported car￾cinomas have been classified to two types according to its spatial 
histologic arrangement. Combined types have a transition zone 
in which HCC and NEC intermingle with each other whereas 
collision types show clear separation of the histologically different 
components, usually by fibrous septa. In our case, the HCC was 
tightly intermingled with the NEC component, their borders 
almost indiscernible due to transition zones. Therefore, we classi￾fied it as combined HCC and NEC.
Primary mixed HCC and NEC generally tend to have a poorer 
prognosis than conventional HCC.1
 Of the 18 cases summarized, 
eight patients experienced recurrence, six patients died within the 
year of operation from the disease, and only two patients were 
confirmed to be alive 2 years after surgery (Table 1). Remarkably, 
in the cases with biopsy-confirmed metastasis, the NEC compo￾nent was solely found in all occasions, similar to the presenting 
case. This indicates that the NEC component acts more aggres￾sively, which has a much poorer prognosis than primary HCC.1
Therefore, it is important to identify the neuroendocrine com￾ponent and assure proper treatment be given to the patient. 
None of the reported combined HCC-NEC described para￾neoplastic syndrome or ectopic hormone production. To our 
knowledge, our case may be the first to report primary mixed 
HCC and NEC associated with malignancy-related hypercalcemia 
caused by ectopic PTH production. The patient had multiple 
bone metastases, and one of which was histologically confirmed. 
In hypercalcemia caused by osteolytic lesions or PTHrP produced 
by tumors, however, PTH levels are usually suppressed.15 It led us 
to favor ectopic PTH production to be the cause for hypercalcemia 
than bone metastasis or PTHrP, even though serum PTHrP 
level was not available. 
The prevalence of hypercalcemia accounts for 7.8% of the 
paraneoplastic syndromes observed in HCC, and is associated 
with short survival.16 Ectopic PTH production has been reported 
in only three HCC cases (Table 2) and not in any primary hepatic 
NEC case. All three cases performed PTH immunohistochem￾istry on their biopsy specimens which were negative. Our case 
also showed negative results. These findings, rather than acting 
as counter-evidence of hormone production, may suggest that 
the tumor cells do not store PTH but secrete it into circulation 
soon after synthesis.18,19 We were not able to perform genetic 
analysis or RNA sequencing for PTH mRNA. As hypercalcemia 
developed during adjuvant CCRT, comparison of intact PTH 
levels of before and after the operation or CCRT was impossible. 
However, in our case, the patient developed hypercalcemia with 
elevated intact PTH as the metastatic lesions formed. Considering 
that the metastatic component was NEC, it may be possible to 
suggest that the intact PTH was synthesized by the NEC cells.
Primary hepatic NEC has poor prognosis, and the NEC com￾ponent of primary mixed HCC and NEC behaves aggressively.
