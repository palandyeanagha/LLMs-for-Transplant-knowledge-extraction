Abstract
Background: The criteria for stopping Delphi studies are often subjective. This study aimed to
examine whether consensus and stability in the Delphi process can be ascertained by descriptive
evaluation of trends in participants' views.
Methods: A three round email-based Delphi required participants (n = 12) to verify their level of
agreement with 8 statements, write comments on each if they considered it necessary and rank the
statements for importance. Each statement was analysed quantitatively by the percentage of
agreement ratings, importance rankings and the amount of comments made for each statement,
and qualitatively using thematic analysis. Importance rankings between rounds were compared by
calculating Kappa values to observe trends in how the process impacts on subject's views.
Results: Evolution of consensus was shown by increase in agreement percentages, convergence of
range with standard deviations of importance ratings, and a decrease in the number of comments
made. Stability was demonstrated by a trend of increasing Kappa values.
Conclusion: Following the original use of Delphi in social sciences, Delphi is suggested to be an
effective way to gain and measure group consensus in healthcare. However, the proposed analytical
process should be followed to ensure maximum validity of results in Delphi methodology for
improved evidence of consensual decision-making.
Background
The Delphi technique is suggested to be an effective way
to gain and measure group consensus in healthcare [1].
Delphi was developed by Dalkey and colleagues at the
RAND Corporation in the 1950's, and is a structured proc￾ess requiring experts to respond to non-leading, unambig￾uous statements with the aim of achieving consensus.
Using a systematic fashion of repeating rounds, where
each subsequent set of statements is built on the
responses to the preceding ones, consensus is sought
through the feedback of information and iteration [2],
and the process is terminated when consensus is reached.
Anonymity offered by Delphi can reduce the inhibition
normally occurring in decision-making as individuals will
be more open with their answers.
Although originally used as a methodological tool in
social sciences, recently there has been a rise in the use of
Delphi in healthcare research [3-9]. Delphi characteristics
have been consistently described in the definitive texts

[2,10,11], and in the paper by Caws [12], which consid￾ered consensus theories in healthcare. Importantly how￾ever, there is no general agreement in the literature that
defines specific criteria to use to determine when consen￾sus has been achieved, i.e. when to stop a Delphi study.
Evidence on the evaluation of Delphi consensus is lim￾ited; researchers have not yet described how to determine
when an exact level of the consensus is reached in Delphi.
Delphi studies have been used to develop and identify
consensus by experts on a given topic. As interest has
grown in the analysis of the data produced by this
method, authors have attempted to clarify the relevant
concepts.
It has been suggested that consensus is the same as agree￾ment and that agreement can be determined by:
1) the aggregate of judgements (the pool of individual
judgements) [2],
2) a move to a subjective level of central tendency [13],
3) or alternatively, by confirming stability, which is "the
consistency of answers between successive rounds of the
study [13]."
The first of these occurs within each Delphi round. The
second and third occur between rounds. Researchers have
been inconsistent in their use of these concepts. In addi￾tion some researchers support the use of pre-determined
levels of consensus to reduce research bias [14] whilst oth￾ers argue that applying numerical values to subjective
responses gives an unconvincing analysis [15].
Scheibe et al.[16] suggest that stability should be used in
Delphi studies to compare the views of participants, as
they believed that reporting a percentage of expressed
views does not reflect the nature of Delphi to look for
resistance to natural centralisation of views. They also
note complete stability will be difficult to attain as there
will always be some "oscillatory movements." A subse￾quent study used stability rather than agreement as termi￾nation criteria for Delphi [13]. Dajani et al. [13] propose
the use of Chi-squared (χ2) to test for stability. However,
this cannot be considered to test stability in Delphi stud￾ies as it will determine "the independence of the rounds
from responses found in them" [13] not the stability of
responses between separate rounds. A study by Chaffin
and Talley [17] using χ2 to determine individual stability
prior to group stability was developed from the work of
Dajani et al., and therefore this should also be viewed
with caution. Since these works few examples of χ2 as a
stability measure appear in Delphi literature. More
recently Greatorex & Dexter used means and standard
deviations (SD) for comparing movement between Del￾phi rounds as a measure of both stability and convergence
[18].
In 1998 the NHS Health Technology Assessment group
produced a detailed report on the requirements of effec￾tive consensus development methods [1] yet could not
identify an appropriate statistical measure for reporting a
move towards consensus, identified by central tendency
in Delphi. They suggested reasoned feedback was advisa￾ble as well as central tendency measures but did not iden￾tify a statistical method which could do this. This lack of
unambiguous criteria for defining consensus clearly
shows that further research is required in this area.
Aim of the Study
In order to reduce the subjectivity in stopping criteria used
in Delphi studies, this study aimed to examine whether
consensus and stability in the Delphi process can be ascer￾tained by descriptive evaluation of trends in participants'
views. We evaluated the evolution of consensus and sta￾bility by examining agreement percentages, importance
rankings (based on simple descriptive statistics) and
Kappa values. These were used to explore how quantita￾tive results could inform Delphi users, firstly on the pro￾duction of central tendency/consensus, and secondly on
stability, thus reducing subjectivity in reporting Delphi
results. The use of simple descriptive statistics, as used in
previous work [18], makes this method very user-friendly.
Methods
An email-based Delphi study was undertaken and com￾parative statistical testing applied. Ethical approval was
obtained from University of Teesside and informed con￾sent obtained from each participant. A convenience heter￾ogeneous sample (n = 12) of volunteer nursing,
occupational therapy and physiotherapy students. A three
round email-based Delphi study was undertaken follow￾ing a pilot, which checked whether the statements were
clear, unambiguous and non-leading. Statements were
taken directly from the paper by McCallin [19] which
reviewed interdisciplinary practice, a topic in which all
students were equivalent experts due to their experiences
as students. The views and opinions reached were irrele￾vant to the studying question, which explored the change
of the opinions towards consensus, rather than the nature
of the consensus itself. In each round, participants were
invited to respond by scaling each statement on degree of
agreement and commenting on each statement as desired,
(see example in Table 1), and finally ranking the state￾ments in order of importance, (see example in Table 2).
Between rounds views were analysed using Colazzi's 7-
stage thematic analysis, modified from Holloway &

Wheeler [20]. Quantitative analysis of the Delphi
included calculations of:
1. Percentage response rates,
2. Percentages for each level of agreement for each state￾ment to compensate for varying response rates,
3. Median, range and their associated group rankings
using the importance ratings,
4. Mean (SD) and their associated group rankings using
the importance ratings,
5. Weighted Kappa (K) values to compare chance-elimi￾nated agreement between rounds.
For the following round, statements were rephrased if
appropriate with the aim of moving towards consensus,
based on the level of agreement and the majority theme
highlighted. Successive rounds consisted of statements
(some rephrased) percentage agreement levels, anony￾mous feedback from the previous round to show the
range of views received, and the importance rankings
using the median rank values. Participants were requested
to read the feedback before responding again to state￾ments.
Scaling methods of agreement and importance were
adapted from Sim & Wright [21] and have been previously
used and described in Delphi literature [2,22,23]. Agree￾ment scales were particularly relevant as they gave an
opportunity for participants to scale each statement inde￾pendently. To make comparisons between rounds and for
feedback, percentage agreements were calculated for each
level of the scale to compensate for varying response rates.
Weighted Kappa (K) statistics were calculated for the
within-subject level of agreement in their importance
rankings between two rounds, not the level of agreement
between participants. K values show a chance-corrected
proportional agreement [24]. A weighted Kappa was
appropriate as un-weighted does not take into account the
magnitude of discrepancies between disagreements
[25,26]. SPSS was unable to calculate the K-values because
of the requirement for a weighted Kappa. Therefore Excel
spreadsheets and handwritten crosstabs were used based
on the descriptions by Armitage et al. [27] and interpreta￾tion by Anthony [28], Table 3 (see Fliess [29] for a full
mathematical explanation and justification of the Kappa
validity). K-values were used to compare agreement of
importance rankings between rounds for each statement
and Chaffin & Talley [17] stated an "individual stability
test for Delphi studies provides more information than a
group stability test," therefore justifying the use of Kappa.
Results
The results section summarises the Delphi in terms of
how consensus and stability evolved through rounds 1 to
3 by looking at the: -
• Agreement percentages,
• Importance rankings,
• Statement evolution,
• Theme production,
• Kappa values.

agreement represented by K-values.

Agreement values were affected in the second round by a
reduced response of 83% (10 of 12).
Statement 1 (Table 4)
The main themes highlighted remained constant through￾out the three rounds but decreased in duplication over the
rounds. The range interval and SD decreased to low levels
(difference of 2 and 0.60 respectively). By the end this
statement had the lowest range and SD, suggesting great￾est stability and consensus, also it had a low number of
comments (3). When the median and mean were equal
the range, 1–3, and SD, 0.60 were low. Importance rank￾ing was always high (second place).
Statement 2 (Table 5)
There was a variety of themes generated (6) in round 1,
suggesting divergence, changing to 3 themes in round 2,
then 2 in round 3, suggesting convergence.
For statement 2 there was an increase in agreement
between round 1 and 2, then divergence rather than con￾vergence occurred between rounds 2 and 3. Based on the
SD there was less consensus for this statement in round 3.
Statement 3 (Table 6)
New themes were generated in round three, also sugges￾tive of instability. Interestingly, the two non-responders
from round 2 disagreed with the third round statement
affecting the percentage of agreement. This was 1 of only
2 statements showing disagreement in round 3 and show￾ing an increase in disagreement between any rounds.
Mean and median ranks both show this statement became
less important to the participants, yet there was always a
2-interval difference between these ranks.
Statement 4 (Table 7)
Four themes were highlighted in round one. Despite the
change in agreement between rounds two and three only
one comment was given in round three, the least number
of comments for any statement throughout the Delphi.
An increase in those strongly agreeing (from 8% to 80%)
was observed for round 2, as shown in Table 7. The level
of those strongly agreeing lowered in round 3 (to 58%).
Mean and median values both showed increase in impor￾tance rankings. As in statement 1, when median and mean
were equal, range and S.D were lowest.

Statement 5 (Table 8)
New themes were generated in round 3 suggesting stabil￾ity had not yet occurred.
For this statement agreement percentages and ranges did
not vary appreciably still showing disagreement in round
3, suggesting stability. Although only changing by 0.06
between rounds 2 and 3, the SD suggests there is still con￾vergence. The statement became less important, ranked 3
to 5.
Statement 6 (Table 9)
Round 1 produced 5 themes. In round 3 all responses
reflected different themes, previous themes and new
themes suggesting the views of participants had not been
exhausted. Agreement increased over the 3 rounds,
inversely to the ranking of importance. Both the median
and the mean define a move towards lesser importance
with the progression of rounds. The range intervals of 6, 5
and 5, over the rounds suggest consensus was weak yet
stability had occurred but the SD was still lowering sug￾gesting continued convergence.
Statement 7 (Table 10)
In round 1 there were 2 themes, which were reflected
again in rounds 2 and 3, although the amount of partici￾pants responding decreased to 3 in both round 2 and
round 3. This statement was consistently high on agree￾ment and importance always ranked first. However, range
interval of 4, and SD of 1.17, were not the lowest observed
in round 3, suggesting the possibility of further conver￾gence.
Statement 8 (Table 11)
Only 4 comments were obtained in round 1 all reflecting
agreement. Round 2 instigated only three comments, still
reflecting agreement. This was the only statement for
which the number of comments increased in round 3
these included new themes, suggesting instability. How￾ever, agreement increased for this statement. Both mean
and median values showed the importance ranking lower
but the range and SD both showed a move towards con￾sensus.
Kappa agreement (Table 12)
In general, K-values increased between rounds when
rounds progressed, and when adjacent rounds were com￾pared as opposed to round 1 Vs round 3. Statement 7,

round 1 Vs round 2 showed the least agreement, K =
0.313, yet was consistently ranked the most important.
This apparent anomaly is discussed below. Statement 4
had the second lowest SD by round 3 yet never achieved a
K > 0.5. Statement 1, 3 and 7 got the 3 highest Kappa val￾ues, comparing round 2 and 3.
Discussion
The Delphi results show a change in participants' views
towards consensus and stability as indicated by a trend
towards:
• an increase in percentage agreements
• convergence of importance rankings
• increase in Kappa values
• a decrease in comments as rounds progressed
An increase was observed in percentage agreements for all
statements over the 3 rounds with only 2 statements
(Tables 6 and 8) showing some disagreement by round 3,
compared to 7 statements in round 1. This demonstrates
the evolution of consensus. Statement 4 (Table 7) had the
highest disagreement percentage in round 1, yet full agree￾ment by round 3, demonstrating that views could alter
considerably.
Oscillatory movements at individual and group level were
consistent with those described by Scheibe et al.[16]. A
deviation in the level of agreement, "strongly agree" or
"agree," between rounds was evident in most statements,
and was not dependent on changes to statement phrasing
(Table 7). The phenomenon of 2 participants failing to
respond to round 2 had a bearing on the oscillatory move￾ment, their lack of response gave a misleading bias
towards agreement (Table 6). Individually both these par￾ticipants disagreed to this statement, demonstrating dis￾advantage in the use of percentages. It is worth noting that
non-responders can impact significantly on the sample
size when interpreting percentages and this could lead to
misleading oscillatory movements as suggested by
Scheibe et al.[16].

The median and mean values for importance show the
group aggregate rank, whereas ranges and SD show the
spread, i.e. disagreement [18] of the group's responses
around that result. Both range and SD decreased as rounds
progressed, showing centralisation of views i.e. increased
agreement or convergence. Comparison of importance
rankings shows similarity in medians and means, equal or
within one interval difference (Tables 4, 5, 7, 8, 9 and 10).
Differences of 2 intervals were shown for statements 3 and
8 (Tables 6 and 11), which were 2 of the statements con￾sistently ranked the least important. These discrepancies
between means and medians could be explained by par￾ticipants giving less attention to statements they consider
least important.
While a decrease in range generally reflected a decrease in
SD, there was no direct relationship between them. For
example, between rounds 2 and 3, in statement 6 the SDs
decreased from 1.65 and 1.56 but the ranges stayed con￾stant, at 3–8. This highlights the different information
each provides, SDs give an indication of the aggregate
judgement where as ranges summarise the outliers views.
Also between statements, equal ranges were represented
by different SDs. For example statements 2 and 3 had a
range of 1–8 in round 1, but standard deviations of 2.50
and 2.27, respectively. These findings expand on Greato￾rex & Dexter's conclusion [18] that each individual Delphi
requires acceptable values of both mean and SD to repre￾sent consensus, by identifying that each statement must
have individual values to determine convergence. How￾ever, this has implications for Delphi research as:-
• there may be increased potential for bias as researchers
will need to make individual judgements on acceptable
convergence levels for each statement,
• Alternatively, preconceived levels of convergence to
determine consensus, as suggested by Williams & Webb
[15], would be difficult to predict.
When interpreting the mean and median importance
rankings, some between-test validity can be demon￾strated. For example, when the mean and median were
equal the lowest ranges and SDs were observed (Tables 4
and 7). Adding and subtracting the SD from the mean
more accurately mirrored the range as the rounds pro￾gressed (table 4). As the SD represents the majority of sub￾jects' variation around the mean, this shows there were
fewer outliers as rounds progressed, again indicating
lower disagreement [18], or increased convergence.
As expected, the greatest difference between K-values was
between round 1 and 3 (Table 12), with K-values nearing
1, and greater agreement for round 2 versus 3. Observed
points from K-values show no association with the ranges,
SDs, medians, means or ranks. Possible explanations for
this are the elimination of chance in Kappa and the com￾parison of between rounds in Kappa rather than values
within a particular round. Also Kappa-crosstabs plot indi￾viduals' rank from one round against their rank in the next
round, therefore K-values measure the value of agreement
for individuals between two rounds, not agreement between
different participants within a round. It was interesting to
observe the apparent contradiction, between the results
for Kappa and percentage agreement for statement 7. This
may have been due to the small range of answers as com￾pared with other statements, because Kappa is affected by
range. This highlights the need to use a range of descrip￾tive statistics in Delphi analysis.
Generally the number of comments decreased in each
round. However, statement 8 (Table 11) did not show a
decrease in comments but followed similar quantitative
data patterns as other statements. One participant did
comment on misunderstanding statement 8 in round 1,
misunderstanding of the statement by participants possi￾bly leading to the equivalent of a loss of a Delphi round
for that statement until the meaning was clarified. This is
validated by the rise in SD and range (Table 11), and rise
in SD for statement 4, which was also misunderstood in
round 1 (Table 7).
New themes were generated in round 3 for the 4 state￾ments of least importance (Tables 6, 8, 9 and 11), suggest￾ing instability, as views had not been exhausted. This was
sometimes contradictory to the SDs and ranges which
showed low scores, however they were still converging/
lowering therefore showing instability. Although aggre￾gating judgements will reduce the strength of the outliers
views in quantitative data, with subjective views outliers
can raise important issues not yet considered by others,
and therefore new themes should not be ignored and
rounds continued until views are exhausted.
Statements 1 and 4 which received fewer comments in
round 3 had the lowest SDs. Because quantitative analysis
aggregates participants' judgements, outlying individual
judgements are not represented. However, the reduction
in comments does support the lowering of range intervals
and SD, substantiating the evolution of consensus and
validating quantitative data with qualitative data.
The results presented here demonstrate two points that
can be used to improve Delphi studies in future. Firstly,
the results have demonstrated that the mean and SD,
when combined with the range and medians, can be used
to show whether convergence has occurred, by a move￾ment towards central tendency. This is in agreement with
the findings of Greatorex and Dexter [18]. The amount of
convergence and therefore the strength of agreement is

(page number not for citation purposes)
indicated by a comparison of SD (strength of aggregate
judgement) and range (larger ranges being indicative of
outliers views). Secondly, high or increasing Kappa values
demonstrate stability of individuals' views within the
group and the level of agreement between rounds. Fur￾thermore, reductions in the number of subjective com￾ments reinforce the quantitative observations of
convergence. It is rare to see this in Delphi studies and it
is proposed that in future Delphi studies, this analytical
combination is used.
There are limitations to this study. This study used a small
sample size therefore the results should be treated with
some caution, and followed up by a larger study. However
this offered the greatest opportunity for analysing all qual￾itative data, because an increased sample size would have
led to saturation of data, and it is not uncommon for Del￾phi studies to use this type of sample size.
Conclusion
Using standard descriptive statistics and Kappa calcula￾tions in conjunction with thematic analysis and the
number of comments generated, it was possible to dem￾onstrate movement towards consensus and stability in
this Delphi study. Following the original use of Delphi in
social science, Delphi is suggested to be an effective way to
gain and measure group consensus in healthcare [1].
There is potential here to add clarification to the use of a
very subjective methodology. It is suggested that a combi￾nation of the simple descriptive statistics as presented here
be used to reduce subjectivity and ensure maximum valid￾ity of results in Delphi methodology for improved evi￾dence of consensual decision-making. The trends
observed in this exploratory study suggest that a larger
study is warranted, following the same approach.
