Abstract
Introduction: Regenerative medicine and particular adult stem cells represent an alternative option with several
fruitful therapeutic applications in patients suffering from chronic lung diseases including idiopathic pulmonary
fibrosis (IPF). Nevertheless, lack of knowledge regarding the origin and the potential of mesenchymal stem cells
(MSCs) to differentiate into fibroblasts has limited their use for the treatment of this dismal disease.
Patients and methods: To this end, we conducted a phase Ib, non-randomized, clinical trial to study the safety of
three endobronchial infusions of autologous adipose derived stromal cells (ADSCs)-stromal vascular fraction (SVF)
(0.5 million cells per kgr of body weight per infusion) in patients with IPF (n=14) of mild to moderate disease
severity (forced vital capacity –FVC>50% predicted value and diffusion lung capacity for carbon monoxide-DLCO>35%
of predicted value). Our primary end-point was incidence of treatment emergent adverse events within 12
months. Alterations of functional, exercise capacity and quality of life parameters at serial time points (baseline,
6 and 12 months after first infusion) were exploratory secondary end-points.
Results: No cases of serious or clinically meaningful adverse events including short-term infusional toxicities as
well as long-term ectopic tissue formation were recorded in all patients. Detailed safety monitoring through
several time-points indicated that cell-treated patients did not deteriorate in both functional parameters and
indicators of quality of life.
Conclusions: The clinical trial met its primary objective demonstrating an acceptable safety profile of
endobronchially administered autologous ADSCs-SVF. Our findings accelerate the rapidly expanded scientific
knowledge and indicate a way towards future efficacy trials.

Introduction
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a devastating,
fibroproliferative chronic lung disorder with complex
and yet unknown disease biology. As a result, there is no
current standard of care for patients with IPF since both
the disease and the effort to treat it are moving targets
[1,2]. The specific pathogenetic pathway, type of cells or
cellular products that should be targeted are under de￾bate. This lack of information has led physicians to apply
a more oncologic approach with the administration of
drug regimens that inhibit multiple pathogenetic path￾ways, including pirfenidone [3,4] and tyrosine kinase in￾hibitors [5], with potential important side-effects. Despite
extensive research efforts and large multicenter clinical
trials, IPF continues to exercise a heavy human, financial
and societal toll on its victims, their loved ones and their
communities in which they work and live. With a grad￾ually increasing worldwide [6] incidence and in view of
the current disappointing status of available pharmaceut￾ical agents the need for developing new treatments for IPF
that are safe, effective and tolerable is now more challen￾ging than ever [7].
Regenerative medicine and particular adult stem cells
represent one such alternative option with several fruitful
therapeutic applications in patients suffering from chronic
lung diseases including IPF [8-19]. The past 5 years inves￾tigations of the therapeutic potential of adult stem cells
and particular mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in experi￾mental models of chronic lung diseases have expanded
rapidly [15]. MSCs are stromal cells that can be readily
harvested from numerous tissues, including bone marrow
(BM), stromal vascular fraction (SVF) of the adipose tissue
and cord blood [8,12,15]. Based on the recently published
statement of International Federation for Adipose Thera￾peutics and Science (IFATS) and the International Society
for Cellular Therapy (ISCT) [20], SVF is a supportive
stroma lying within adipose tissue, which represents an
abundant and easily accessible source of a heterogeneous
cell population including hematopoietic and endothelial
precursors as well as erythrocytes, fibroblasts, lympho￾cytes, monocyte/macrophages and pericytes [20-27]. How￾ever, the most important cell subpopulation of SVF is
adipose-derived stromal cells (ADSCs) that seem to repre￾sent approximately 20% of initially isolated SVF cells.
When SVF cells are seeded into culture they can be fur￾ther purified from hematopoietic cellular components
allowing increased expression of stromal markers (CD29,
73, 13, 90, 105 greater than 80% of cells) and progressive
loss of stem cell associated (CD34) and hematopoietic
(CD45) markers, a phenotypic profile resembling that of
BM-MSCs.
Based on their unique pleiotropic paracrine properties
[28-32], BM or umbilical cord MSCs, and adipose derived
stromal cells - stromal vascular fraction (ADSCs-SVF)
have been demonstrated to exert beneficial therapeutic
effects in the experimental model of lung fibrosis [33-37]
and emphysema [29,38,39], respectively.
On the contrary with pulmonary and critical care
medicine, the use of stem cell therapy is now being
established to patients suffering from complications
following acute myocardial infarction [40-45]. Although
efficacy results arising from these studies seem rather
confusing and conflicting, all of them were characterized
by encouraging safety data. The latter studies offered
pivotal clinical insights and accidentally in one of them
authors came up with an exploratory finding as they
reported lung function improvement in the majority of
patients [40]. This observation captured interest of chest
physicians and triggered the launch of two clinical trials
assessing the safety and efficacy of intravenous infusion
of allogeneic BM-MSCs in patients with moderate and
severe COPD. Encouragingly both studies reported an
acceptable safety profile while none of them finally met
efficacy objectives [46,47]. However, there is significant
lack of knowledge regarding the exact fate of these cells
within a fibrotic microenvironment, evidence that has
limited their widespread clinical applicability.
To provide useful clinical insights that will help us to
overcome major safety and ethical concerns accelerating
the application status of stem cell therapy in IPF, we
conducted a phase Ib non randomized, no placebo con￾trolled, clinical trial to primarily study the safety profile
of the endobronchial infusion of ADSCs-SVF, in patients
with IPF of mild to moderate disease severity as assessed
by functional status. Parameters related to functional
profile, including forced vital capacity (FVC), diffusion
lung capacity for carbon dioxide (DLCO), exercise capacity
(6-minute walking test-MWT) and quality of life (Saint
George’s Research Questionnaire-SGRQ were investigated
as secondary exploratory end-points. Some of the results
of these studies have been previously reported in the form
of an abstract [48].
Patients and methods
Trial design
This study was a phase Ib, non-randomized, no
placebo-controlled, unicentric clinical trial, conducted
at the Department of Pneumonology, Medical School,
Democritus University of Thrace and University Hospital
of Alexandroupolis, Greece. Our study followed an already
published protocol (inclusion, exclusion criteria, primary
and secondary end-points) with slight modifications
[13]. Our primary aim was to investigate the safety pro￾file of autologous endobronchially administered autolo￾gous ADSCs-SVF in patients suffering from IPF based
on the recently published diagnostic criteria of ATS/
ERS (2011) [2], of mild to moderate disease severity as
estimated by functional parameters including FVC

>50% and DLCO >35% of the predicted normal values.
Our exploratory secondary goals were to assess efficacy
of stem cell infusion based on functional, exercise cap￾acity and quality of life criteria analyzed below. Between
June of 2010 and September of 2011, a total of 20 pa￾tients were screened for enrolment in the study. Among
them, 5 were excluded due to DLCO<35% and 1 refused
to sign a consent form (Figure 1). Finally, 14 patients
were enrolled in the study. The trial was conducted in
compliance with current Good Clinical Practice stan￾dards and in accordance with the principles set forth
under the Declaration of Helsinki (1989). The study was
approved by Local Ethics Committee and the institu￾tional review board of the University Hospital of
Alexandroupolis, Democritus University of Thrace
(EHD33/1SC/16-02-2010) before the initiation of pa￾tient enrollment. All patients entering the trial agreed
to and signed an institutional review board approved
statement of informed consent.
Lipoaspiration, isolation, activation, characterization and
endobronchial infusion of ADSCs-SVF
ADSCs-SVF were obtained by lipoaspiration, isolated and
activated according to an already published protocol with
slight modifications [13]. In order to increase the thera￾peutic paracrine, anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic,
potential of isolated cells, we applied a two-step activa￾tion procedure on the date of administration: a) Activa￾tion through autologous platelet rich protein (PRP)
[49]. b) Activation using low level laser irradiation (5J/cm2
)
[50,51]. Following lipoaspiration, isolation and activation,
a small volume of suspension (0.1cc) containing isolated
cells was used for flow cytometry analysis on an epics
Beckman Coulter flow cytometer. Since adipose derived￾SVF consists of a heterogeneous cell population and to
better define isolated cells we used a complete panel of
differentiation markers comprising of the minimum re￾quired mesenchymal markers (CD29, CD73, CD90,
CD105) [52] coupled with additional mesenchymal stro￾mal cell markers including, CD44, CD13, CD116, as well
as markers for leukocytic, hematopoietic and endothelial
precursor markers, namely CD45, CD34 and CD31
(Figure 2). After isolation, activation and characterization
our cellular sample was tested for pyrogenicity, using a
commercial limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL) test (LAL
chromogen end point assay Hycult Biotech Plymouth
Meeting PA USA). Our final sample was diluted 1/10 in
normal saline and then injected through the broncho￾scopic channel in both patient’s lungs (final volume of 5cc
in each lung). The activation, characterization and
infusional procedures were performed thrice at monthly
intervals. Details can be found in Additional file 1.
Labeling of ADSCs-SVF with 99mTc-HMPAO (99mTc-ceretec)
and scintigraphic analysis
To visualize isolated cells within both lungs, in a repre￾sentative number of patients (n=4), we labeled them
with hexametazine 99mTc-HMPAO (trade name Ceretec,

a lyophilized molecule that helps 99mTc to enter within
the cell membranes) according to a modified protocol
[53]. Retention of radiolabeled cells (99mTc-HMPAO)
within both lungs was estimated with computerized
image analysis by drawing regions of interest and calcu￾lating the average counts/pixels (average count). Details
can be found in Additional file 1.
Treatment group
Based on already published data showing an acceptable
safety and efficacy profile of intravenously administered
dose regimens of approximately 1.5 million BM-MSCs
per body weight in patients suffering from either COPD
[47] or myocardial infarction [41] we decided to administer
in both patients’ lungs an overall of 1.5 × 106 ADSCs-SVF
per kgr of body weight divided into three doses, meaning
0.5 ×106 ADSCs-SVF per kgr of body weight per infusion
in each patient with IPF.
All eligible patients underwent bronchoscopy using a
flexible bronchoscope, under local anesthesia (xylocaine).
The flexible bronchoscope was guided into the lower lobes
of both lungs and 1 aliquot containing ADSCs-SVF di￾luted into 10 cc of normal saline 0.9% was infused using a
small catheter (2.0mm of diameter) through the broncho￾scopic channel. Procedure was repeated thrice for every
patient at monthly intervals.

Primary and secondary end-points
1) Primary safety assessments included monitoring and
recording of all adverse events and serious adverse
events. Arterial blood gases coupled with clinical
(Medical Research Council-MRC dyspnea scale),
electrocardiogram and monitoring of vital signs
(temperature, oxygen saturation, respiratory and
heart rate) were performed during the first 24 hours
after each endobronchial infusion. The patient was
then discharged 24 hours post-bronchoscopy given
that he/she was afebrile and hemodynamically stable,
with no signs of infection or any type of allergic
reaction. Whole body computed tomography (CT)
scan was performed in all patients to determine any
ectopic tissue formation at the end of the follow-up
period, meaning 12 months after the first stem cell
infusion. Patients were subdivided into three
categories depending on the level of toxicity. Details
can be found in Additional file 1.
2) As exploratory secondary end-points we investigated
whether stem cell infusion exerted any beneficial
effects as assessed by clinical (modified Medical
Research Council-mMRC dyspnea scales functional
(FVC, DLCO), exercise capacity (6-minute walking
test-MWT) and quality of life (Saint George’s
Research Questionnaire-SGRQ) parameters, at
baseline and at serial time points (6 and 12 months
after the first endobronchial administration) [13].
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using the SPSS 17.0 and
OriginPro8 software. Summaries of continuous measures
were presented as the mean and SD. Safety and explo￾ratory efficacy secondary end-points were observed for
each patient against the baseline values. Comparisons of
changes from baseline conditions were analyzed using the
Student t test (independent sample t-test between treat￾ment groups and 2-tailed, paired for pooled analysis) with
the Bonferroni correction. Where multiple comparisons
were performed, analysis of variance (ANOVA) with re￾peated measures was employed. Testing was performed at
a 95% significance level. A p value <0.05 was considered
as statistically significant.
Results
ADSCs-SVF differential cell count and viability
After lipoaspiration, isolation and activation using autolo￾gous PRP and photobiostimulation, isolated cells were
analyzed for the expression of stem-cell specific surface
antigens. To better characterize our heterogeneous cell
population included within adipose tissue SVF a complete
panel of markers was used. In line with previous reports
[21,27,54], including flow cytometry analysis revealed
that the majority of isolated cells were positive for mes￾enchymal markers including CD29: 79.1% (65.2 – 86.7),
CD73: 67.7% (55.2 – 79.1), CD90: 59.3% (45.3 – 69.4),
CD105: 50.1% (48.7 – 58.2), CD44: 90,3% (88.5 – 93.6),
CD13: 54.2% (37.2 – 67.1) and CD116: 60.8% (49.4 – 64.1)
(median values-range) while they were negative for CD45
and CD31. In addition, the remaining cells expressed
CD34 marker: 28.8% (21.2 – 37.1) (median values-range),
indicating the presence of hematopoietic and endothelial
precursors. Based on the recently published statement of
IFATS-ISCT [20] immunophenotypic profile of isolated
cells (CD29+, CD73+, CD90+, CD105+, CD13+, CD44+,
CD116+, CD34+ and CD31-CD45-) following their activa￾tion was consistent with the definition of adipose derived
stromal cells lying within SVF (SVF subpopulation is add￾itionally characterized by CD45 positivity) and therefore
infused cells were defined as ADSCs-SVF. Cellular popula￾tion exhibited an 80% consistency among patients en￾rolled, as shown in Table 1.
Patients’ demographic data
All enrolled patients (n=14), completed all three
endobronchial infusions. In addition, there was no pa￾tient that early terminated the study period, meaning 12
months follow-up period after the first endobronchial
infusion. Demographic and baseline patient data are
listed in Table 2. The majority of patients were males
(12/14, 86%) while all patients were ex-smokers. All
cases had a typical pattern of usual interstitial pneumo￾nia (UIP) in chest HRCT scan. In 6 cases diagnosis of
IPF was based on both radiological and histological
criteria while 4 patients (28.5%) were characterized by
the presence of upper lobe emphysema in chest HRCT.
5 patients were subjected to VATS in another depart￾ment before visiting our department for further consid￾eration. IPF diagnosis in this group of patients (based
on radiological and histopathological criteria) was set
before current guidelines were published. All patients
were of mild to moderate disease severity based on func￾tional data with baseline values in FVC%pred: 71.2±15.2
and DLCO%pred: 48.4±11.1. In addition, all patients
were in good clinical condition walking approximately
475 meters during 6-minute walking test while none of
the patients exhibited elevated levels of sPAP. Despite
that, it is worth reporting that patients exhibited rather
increased scores in indicators of quality of life, namely
SGRQ (35.1±6.8). Five out of 14 patients (33%) were
previously under low doses of corticosteroids (10 mg of
prednisolone daily) and high-doses of N-acetylcysteine
(1800 mgr per day) prior study enrolment and therefore
entered a 6 week wash-out period of time before enter￾ing the study. The remaining 9 patients were treatment
naïve by the time of study enrolment.

Safety outcomes
An acceptable safety profile of stem cells’ endobronchial
infusions was reported in all patients enrolled in the
study. All endobronchial infusions were well tolerated
and no serious or clinically significant side effects were
reported during the entire study period and over the 72
infusions (14 patients with 3 infusions each). As shown
in Table 3, there were no side effects of minor or
medium severity, including allergic reactions, liver or
renal abnormalities, oxygen desaturations, cardiac ab￾normalities such as electrocardiogram or heart rate
changes in 12 out of 14 patients (86%). There were only
two patients (14%) that experienced worsening of cough
and dyspnea accompanied by heart burn, oxygen desat￾uration (94% - 92% while breathing room air) and in￾crease in heart rate (from 75bpm to 95bpm) shortly after
the first endobronchial infusion (30 minutes) that were
successfully managed with oxygen supply without any
additional treatment. The above events did not reach
clinical importance of disease acute exacerbation, since a
non-statistically significant functional decline of 4.4% of
FVC%pred. between baseline and 6 months after the
first infusion (71.4 vs. 67) or 177ml in absolute values
(2877 vs. 2700 ml) in the first patient and a decline of
8.2% of FVC%pred. (70.6 vs. 62.4) or 360 ml (2900 vs.
2540 ml) in absolute values in the second patient, were
noted. Furthermore, 7 out of 14 patients (50%) com￾plained of transient fever that lasted 24 hours after
each endobronchial administration and was partially
attributed to the bronchoscopic procedure [55]. How￾ever, the possibility that cell treatment could be re￾sponsible for this minor side effect cannot be excluded.
Finally none of the patients experienced any ectopic
tissue formation as reported by whole body CT scan
that was performed at the end of the follow-up period,
meaning 12 months after the first stem cell administra￾tion. Additionally available safety data 24 months follow￾ing first infusion also revealed no ectopic tissue formation.
Efficacy outcomes
There were no statistically significant differences in none
of the studied functional parameters (FVC, FVC%pred.
and DLCO%pred.) at baseline and 6 and 12 months follow￾ing 3 endobronchial infusions of ADSCs-SVF (Table 2,
Figures 2A-D). Additionally, available data 3 months prior
stem cell administration in 5 subjects that were finally
enrolled in the study also revealed no functional deterior￾ation (Figures 3A, B). In addition, no significant alterations
in mMRC dyspnea scale were also noted at both serial
time points of treatment follow-up period as well as prior
treatment initiation (Table 2). Furthermore, no statistically
significant or clinically meaningful differences were also
observed in 6MWD at 3 months prior treatment initi￾ation, at baseline and at 6 and 12 months post-first
endobronchial infusion (mean improvement of 5 and 4 m,
respectively) (Figure 2C). Improvements in parameters of
quality of life as estimated by a statistically significant
decline in SGRQ (35.1±6.8 vs. p=27.2±5.6, p=0.02 and

35.1±6.8 vs. 28.4±5.7, p=0.02, respectively) scoring values,
both after 6 and 12 months, were also noted (Figure 2D).
Finally, a trend towards increase in systolic pulmonary
artery pressure (sPAP) at 6 and 12 months post-first
endobronchial infusion, although not statistically signifi￾cant, was also noted.
Scintigraphic analysis
As illustrated in Figure 3, 99mTc lung scintigraphy (an￾terior view) at different time points (30 min, 90 min and
24 hours) after endobronchial infusion of ADSCs-SVF
in representative number of patients enrolled (n=4)
demonstrated the presence of endobronchially infused
radiolabeled ADSCs-SVF within patients’ lungs even 24
hours after the infusion. In particular, retention of
radiolabeled cells (99mTc-HMPAO) within both lungs
in two representative subjects (right and left panel, A-C,
respectively) was estimated with computerized image
analysis by drawing regions of interest and calculating
the average counts/pixels (average count). As depicted
in Figure 3, signal intensity in both patients (right and left
panel), although exhibited an expected decline through
serial time-points (30 min vs. 90 min vs. 24 hours),

nevertheless was present even 24 hours after the infusion.
The latter evidence indicates the presence of ADSCs-SVF
since free technetium (99mTcO4) has a half-time life equal

Discussion
This is the first study investigating the safety profile of
stem cell therapy in patients with IPF. The clinical trial
met its primary objective demonstrating an acceptable
and tolerable safety profile of endobronchially adminis￾tered autologous ADSCs-SVF, during the infusions and
during short- and long-term follow-up. Although this
study was not designed to delineate mechanisms of
actions or authenticate efficacy, it provides indications
that current therapeutic approach may be of some bene￾fit. In particular, almost all studied participants (86%)
followed-up for 12 months exhibited stable functional
and exercise capacity status, evidence that needs to be
further explored. Comparisons of available clinical and
functional data in 5 subjects 3 months prior treatment
initiation and during follow-up period also revealed no
deterioration. Improvements in indicators of quality of
life (SGRQ) were also reported indicating a potentially
substantial psychological impact of cell-based therapies
in patients with devastating chronic lung diseases with
treatment, yet, ineffective.
The present results accelerate the rapidly expanded
scientific knowledge and establish a rigid basis for future
efficacy trials investigating the therapeutic use of cell￾based therapies in patients with chronic lung diseases,
including IPF overcoming fears, ethical issues and safety
concerns. The latter mainly arise from the absence of a
coordinated statement regarding the exact mechanisms
of action and fate of MSCs, within an inflammatory,
fibrotic and dysplastic microenvironment that severely
hampered clinicians’ efforts to study stem cell the￾rapeutic potential in adult injured lung [8,12,15]. This
rather disappointing ascertainment currently dominates
respiratory research field despite the fact that a continu￾ing accumulation of data supports both safety and effi￾cacy of stem cell therapy in animal models as assessed
by attenuation of experimental lung fibrosis and inflam￾mation potentially mediated through MSCs protective
paracrine properties [15,34-37].
In view of the significant lack of knowledge regarding
the applicability of stem cell therapy in patients with IPF
coupled with the current disappointing survival data
arising from large multicentre clinical trials and the
absence of a standard of care, we conducted a phase Ib,
non-randomized, no placebo-controlled trial to study
primarily the safety of the endobronchial infusion of
autologous ADSCs-SVF in patients with IPF of mild to
moderate disease severity (FVC>50%, DLCO>35%). As
secondary exploratory endpoints we decided to include
Figure 3 99mTc lung scintigraphy at different time points (30 min, 90 min and 24 hours) after endobronchial infusion of the adipose
derived stromal cells-stromal vascular fraction (ADSCs-SVF) in two representative subjects (right and left panel, A, B and C,
respectively). Retention of radiolabeled cells (99mTc-HMPAO) within both lungs was estimated with computerized image analysis by drawing
regions of interest (roi) and calculating the average counts/pixels (average count). As depicted, signal intensity in both patients (right and left
panel), although exhibited an expected decline through serial time-points (30 min vs. 90 min vs. 24 hours), nevertheless was present even 24
hours after the infusion. The latter evidence indicates the presence of ADSCs-SVF since free technetium (99mTcO4) has a half-time life equal to 6
hours and therefore it was impossible to produce signal 24 hours after the infusion.

efficacy issues focusing on clinical (mMRC dyspnea scale),
functional (FVC, DLCO), exercise capacity (6MWD) and
quality of life indicators (SGRQ and CAT).
The most important finding of our study was the dem￾onstration of an acceptable safety profile of adipose de￾rived stem cell therapy locally administered within injured
IPF lungs. Our approach exhibited a number of advan￾tages including the following:
1) Firstly we used minimally manipulated autologous
ADSCs-SVF lying in abundance within adipose
tissue, thus eliminating the need for culturing over
days to obtain a therapeutically viable number. In
addition, cells were easily obtained by lipoaspiration,
a procedure that is less painful than harvest of bone
marrow. A growing body of evidence currently
supports the notion that therapies involving
minimally manipulated MSCs can overcome the fear
and concern of undesirable alterations of allogeneic
MSCs during ex vivo cellular expansion, including
immunogenicity, contaminations, tumor, ectopic
tissue formation and organ toxicity resulting from
undesirable engraftment in the microvasculature
[15,16,34,56-59]. In our study, ADSCs-SVF, were
neither cultured nor expanded and were directly
infused within the patients’ lungs after implementing
a two-step activation procedure using a cocktail of
autologous growth factors (PRP) [50] and
photobiostimulation [51], two novel approaches
known to amplify paracrine beneficial effects of
MSCs. Furthermore, recent preclinical and human
studies have raised significant concerns with regards
to possible dysfunctional migratory and paracrine
properties of ADSCs-SVF derived from older
individuals [60] and mice [61]. In particular, Uji
et al. [61] recently reported that stromal cells
derived from the adipose tissue of relatively older
mice exhibited reduced migratory capacity and failed
to attenuate bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis. While
the subject of an ongoing study, cultures of ADSCs￾SVF derived from representative patients with IPF
revealed a significant increase in the number of
ADSCs-SVF colonies and an overexpression of anti￾inflammatory (IL1-receptor antagonist) and
angiogenic (vascular endothelial growth factor-VEGF)
mediators, following activation with PRP and laser
irradiation. Furthermore, no induction in the
expression of mesenchymal markers (transforming
growth factor-TGF-b, a-smooth muscle actin) or
phenotypic characteristics compatible with fibroblast
differentiation were observed (data not shown). In
line with extended experimental [29,34,36,37] and
human data [40,42,43,47,56,57] our patients did not
experience any serious or clinically meaningful side
effects, both during short-and long- term follow-up
period, since no infusional toxicities, allergic
reactions, disease acute exacerbations or ectopic
tissue formation and tumor development were
observed to date (24 months after the first infusion).
2) Secondly, in order to better characterize our isolated
cell population and given significant controversies
regarding isolation and characterization procedures
between different laboratories we applied the most
recent statement of IFATS/ISCT [20] and used a
complete panel of surface antigens (n=10). Based on
the recent definition of IFATS/ISCT our isolated
cells, after being activated, developed characteristics
of an immunophenotypic profile that lies between
crude SVF cells and ADSCs for the following
reasons: a) Consistently undetectable levels of CD45+
cells (characteristic of initially isolated SVF cells),
b) levels of stromal markers (CD13, 29, 73, 90, 105)
higher than those described in initially isolated SVF
cells that did not reach peak levels seen in ADSCs
which represent a more homogeneous cell
population. c) Expression levels of stem cell
associated marker CD34 were consistently high;
however they were neither at peak values as
observed in crude SVF population nor absent as
noted in ADSCs. It seems that activation
procedures may account for the temporal loss of
expression markers that are present in the crude
SVF cellular mixture rendering activated cells to
exhibit a surface protein profile tending to resemble
that of MSCs. Therefore, we applied the term
ADSCs-SVF that better characterizes our isolated
and activated cell population.
3) Thirdly, given that IPF pathogenesis is mainly
restricted to the lungs and experimental data reports
that intravenous stem cell administration is
characterized by minimal lung uptake [62], we
decided to deliver cells endobronchially in order to
achieve maximum accumulation into sites of
ongoing injury and thus, maximize their therapeutic
potential. A semi-invasive technique of
administration was chosen, namely bronchoscopy
that was proven both well tolerable and accurate as
estimated by scintigraphic analysis demonstrating
prolonged strong signal intensity exhibited by
radiolabeled stem cells and sustained even 24 hours
after the infusion. Whether local administration of
ADSCs-SVF will be proven more efficacious than
systemic delivery remains to be elucidated.
4) Finally and most importantly we deliberately
selected patients with mild to moderate disease
severity since our study was designed to provide
safety data and therefore events of disease acute
exacerbation or progression that are more likely to
Tzouvelekis et al. Journal of Translational Medicine 2013, 11:171 Page 9 of 13
http://www.translational-medicine.com/content/11/1/171

occur in patients with end-stage lung disease could
have masked our results. In addition, current
experimental data demonstrates maximum beneficial
effects during the early inflammatory stages of
modeled disease that disappear later when
established fibrosis has developed [36,63].
Nevertheless, the last parallelism is arbitrary and
should be treated cautiously. Future studies are
warranted to support this notion.
Despite relative enthusiasm arising from our safety
data, our trial is underpowered and exhibits a number of
caveats that should be addressed cautiously before rigid
conclusions can be drawn. This trial has not been
designed neither to investigate efficacy nor to elucidate
mechanisms of stem cells’ actions. Therefore exploratory
efficacy data presented here should be interpreted cau￾tiously and rigid conclusions cannot be drawn safely. At
this point it is worth reporting that statistically significant
improvements in indicators of quality of life that were
observed in almost all our patients (86%) may reflect a
placebo-effect and deserve additional verification. Further￾more, any statements that arise from functional and exer￾cise capacity outcomes indicating disease stabilization
would be too speculative and therefore should be avoided
for the moment. It is also debatable whether a trend
towards increase in sPAP at 6 and 12 months post-first
endobronchial infusion could be attributed to therapeutic
interventions or simply reflects an epiphenomenon due to
unreliable methods of sPAP assessment such as cardiac
echo. Additionally available efficacy data 24 months after
first infusion were excluded from current analysis since all
enrolled patients after completing the 12 month follow-up
period were switched to pirfenidone treatment based on
the recently published CAPACITY trials [3] and therefore
it was impossible to attribute any functional alterations
solely to cell-based therapy.
Furthermore the use of a heterogeneous mixture of
cell population such as adipose tissue SVF raises signifi￾cant methodological limitations since the exact contribu￾tion of each one of them could not be delineated based
on our study design. To substantiate our findings and
better define our isolated cell population, we utilized a
complete panel of mesenchymal, hematopoietic and
endothelial markers. As shown in Table 1 and in line
with previous reports [21,27,54], the majority of our
non-cultured, non-expanded ADSCs-SVF were of mes￾enchymal origin, meaning that they were positive for the
minimally required markers such as CD29, 73, 90, 105
as well as for CD44, CD13 and CD116. In addition,
ADSCs-SVF after activation did not express surface anti￾gens CD31, 45, as expected. Finally, almost a third of
our cells stained positive for CD34 indicating the pres￾ence of hematopoietic and endothelial progenitors. One
alternative approach was to purify MSCs by subtracting
CD45-, CD31- CD34- cells using immunomagnetic beads.
Nevertheless, we decided to avoid manipulation of
isolated cells since by infusing unpurified ADSCs-SVF
we exploited the beneficial stemness of the entire cell
population including MSCs, lymphocytes, endothelial
progenitors and hematopoietic stem cells.
While our results indicate some reassurance regarding
endobronchial infusion of stem cells in patients with IPF,
significant work is sorely needed to understand complex
stem cell properties as well as their behavior and fate
within a fibrotic microenvironment. Currently, whether
MSCs could differentiate into fibroblasts [64] given their
common mesodermal origin and accelerate fibrotic cas￾cade or even promote tumorigenesis on a longitudinal
basis, is under debate. Alternatively, we may speculate that
ADSCs-SVF may exert their beneficial effects through
their unique paracrine activities (anti-inflammatory, anti￾fibrotic, anti-apoptotic and immunomodulatory) and less
by acting as cells with regenerative capacity. In line with
this premise and given a potential association between
global immune impairment [65-67] and fibrogenesis we
may speculate that a proportion of ADSCs-SVF may act as
T regulatory cells [68] restoring immune deregulation and
attenuating inflammatory and fibrotic cascade. The above
statement is currently only speculative and needs further
exploration. Studies are underway to shed further light
into stem cells’ behaviour and resolve mechanistic issues
surrounding their use.
Conclusion
Collectively, this study was conducted to assess the safety
of endobronchial delivery of autologous ADSCs-SVF in
patients with IPF. Importantly our study met its primary
objective and indicated an acceptable safety profile both
with regard to acute infusions and during long-term
follow-up. Detailed safety monitoring through several
time-points indicated that cell-treated patients did not
deteriorate, as assessed by functional parameters and indi￾cators of quality of life. Whether these results represent
placebo effect and bystander epiphenomena of an already
prescribed favourable clinical course and not true out￾comes of a therapeutic intervention remains to be proven.
Our findings provide a way towards future, carefully
designed, efficacy trials investigating the therapeutic use of
cell-based therapies in patients with chronic lung diseases,
including IPF overcoming steep barriers such as ethical
issues and safety concerns.
