Abstract
Background: Most current guidelines recommend two serological tests to diagnose chronic Chagas disease. When
serological tests are persistently inconclusive, some guidelines recommend molecular tests. The aim of this
investigation was to review chronic Chagas disease diagnosis literature and to summarize results of ELISA and PCR
performance.
Methods: A systematic review was conducted searching remote databases (MEDLINE, LILACS, EMBASE, SCOPUS
and ISIWeb) and full texts bibliography for relevant abstracts. In addition, manufacturers of commercial tests were
contacted. Original investigations were eligible if they estimated sensitivity and specificity, or reliability -or if their
calculation was possible - of ELISA or PCR tests, for chronic Chagas disease.
Results: Heterogeneity was high within each test (ELISA and PCR) and threshold effect was detected only in a
particular subgroup. Reference standard blinding partially explained heterogeneity in ELISA studies, and pooled
sensitivity and specificity were 97.7% [96.7%-98.5%] and 96.3% [94.6%-97.6%] respectively. Commercial ELISA with
recombinant antigens studied in phase three investigations partially explained heterogeneity, and pooled sensitivity
and specificity were 99.3% [97.9%-99.9%] and 97.5% [88.5%-99.5%] respectively. ELISA’s reliability was seldom
studied but was considered acceptable. PCR heterogeneity was not explained, but a threshold effect was detected
in three groups created by using guanidine and boiling the sample before DNA extraction. PCR sensitivity is likely
to be between 50% and 90%, while its specificity is close to 100%. PCR reliability was never studied.
Conclusions: Both conventional and recombinant based ELISA give useful information, however there are
commercial tests without technical reports and therefore were not included in this review. Physicians need to have
access to technical reports to understand if these serological tests are similar to those included in this review and
therefore correctly order and interpret test results. Currently, PCR should not be used in clinical practice for chronic
Chagas disease diagnosis and there is no PCR test commercially available for this purpose. Tests limitations and
directions for future research are discussed.
Background
Chagas disease is an infection, in which the necessary
cause is a parasite called Trypanosoma cruzi. This dis￾ease is endemic in Latin American countries and
approximately 15 million people are estimated to be
infected [1]. With progressive control of vector borne
transmission in the majority of Latin American coun￾tries,[1] much attention has been given to the possibility
of Chagas disease spread outside Latin America through
blood donation and/or organ transplants, due to the
increasing migration of Latin Americans around the
world [2]. Case reports of Chagas disease from countries
in which this infection is not typically endemic, such as
France[3], Canada[4-6], Switzerland[7], Denmark[8],
Germany[9], USA[10-12], and Spain[13,14] indicate that
in the appropriate clinical situation, Chagas disease
should be considered as differential diagnosis not only
in Latin Americans, but also in individuals who are not
from Latin America.
One significant difficulty in diagnosing Chagas disease
is that most patients have no symptoms in acute or
chronic phase [2,15,16]. Another difficulty in diagnosis
is that, unlike most infectious diseases, the direct or
parasitological tests for Chagas disease (thick or thin

smear, microhematocrit, hemocultures or xenodiagnosis)
have unacceptably low sensitivity in the chronic phase,
ranging from 50% to 70%,[17] and are not recom￾mended [15-19]. Thus, the diagnosis relies almost solely
on serological tests.
Screening blood donors for Chagas disease is of much
concern in all Latin American countries. Although the
World Health Organization (WHO) expert committee
and some guidelines recommend a single enzyme linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test to screen blood
donors,[16,18,19] in some countries, such as Brazil[15],
there is a more restrictive regulation, recommending
two simultaneous (in parallel) tests of different techni￾ques. Due to potential transmission of Chagas disease
through blood transfusion, the United States of America,
Spain and other non Latin American countries also
screen blood donors for Chagas disease [20,21].
Currently, Pan-American Health Organization
(PAHO) recommendations[16] and other guidelines
[2,15,17,18] advise the use of two different serological
techniques for chronic Chagas disease diagnosis, one of
the techniques being ELISA. The basis of this recom￾mendation is not clear, although some authors claim it
to be due to poor concordance between ELISA and
other serological tests,[22-25] and others claim it is due
to limited specificity [2]. It is known that ELISA tests, as
most tests used for screening purposes, may occasionally
lead to false positive results, which must be confirmed
later by other assays.
A pitfall of conventional ELISA is the possibility of
cross-reaction with antibodies from patients infected
with Leishmania sp. or T. rangeli [26-28]. This is a diffi￾cult problem to solve where these infections share ende￾micity with Chagas disease. In an attempt to overcome
these limitations, efforts were made to develop ELISA
with recombinant antigens (ELISA-rec) and polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) tests for Chagas disease.
Currently, PCR test may be recommended depending
on the situation and guideline considered. PCR test is
recommended for chronic Chagas disease diagnosis
only when serological tests are inconclusive by the
Brazilian and Chilean consensus; [15,17] may be
recommended only as confirmatory test after screening
of blood donors according to El Salvador’s guideline;
[16] it is recommended only for acute or congenital
infection diagnosis or therapy follow-up after acute
infection diagnosis according to WHO expert commit￾tee[19] and a north American review;[2] and according
to Spanish consensus a patient is considered with Cha￾gas disease either with two positive serological test or
PCR (or other parasitological) positive test when
chronic disease is suspected [18]. Thus, the use of
PCR tests for chronic Chagas disease diagnosis is
controversial.
The aims of this investigation were summarize sensi￾tivity, specificity and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) for
ELISA, ELISA-rec and PCR; evaluate the heterogeneity
within this literature for chronic Chagas disease; and
compare the overall accuracy of these three tests.
Methods
This investigation was designed as a systematic review
and meta-analysis.
Search strategies
Three bibliographic methods were used to identify poten￾tial abstracts or investigations: remote search in electro￾nic databases; bibliographic citations from included and
excluded full text retrieved from other search methods;
email contact with manufacturers that had any device or
diagnostic kit concerning Chagas disease registered at
ANVISA (Agência Nacional de Vigilância Sanitária - or
the Brazilian National Agency of Sanitary Surveillance)
through October 2007. No hand search or contacts with
experts were made.
Electronic searches were executed in five different
databases on June 6th, 2007: PubMed/Medline; SCOPUS;
LILACS; ISIWeb/Web of Science; and EMBASE. The
following strategy was developed in PubMed/Medline
using clinical queries for diagnostic studies maximizing
the sensitivity of the search: ("Chagas Disease"[MeSH]
OR “Trypanosoma cruzi"[MeSH]) AND (ELISA OR
(enzyme AND linked AND assay) OR PCR OR (polymer￾ase AND chain AND reaction))) AND (sensitiv*[Title/
Abstract] OR sensitivity and specificity[MeSH Terms] OR
diagnos*[Title/Abstract] OR diagnosis[MeSH:noexp] OR
diagnostic*[MeSH:noexp] OR diagnosis, differential
[MeSH:noexp] OR diagnosis[Subheading:noexp] OR
“Reproducibility of Results"[Mesh] OR reliability OR
reproducibility). This strategy was adapted to the other
four bases and they were all updated on April 20th,
2009.
In December 2007, the ANVISA website http://www7.
anvisa.gov.br/datavisa/Consulta_Produto_correlato/con￾sulta_correlato.asp was accessed to check for medical
products, devices or kits related to Chagas disease. At
the time, there were 52 registries, and only seven were
active. Since technical reports used to register these pro￾ducts are not available at ANVISA website, emails were
sent to manufacturers or their legal distributors request￾ing the technical report, monographs, non-published lit￾erature or a reference of a published report related to
their product.
Inclusion/exclusion criteria
The abstracts were eligible for full text evaluation if
their aims were: estimate sensitivity or specificity of one
or more ELISA or PCR for chronic Chagas disease;

estimate accuracy of an ELISA or PCR for chronic Cha￾gas disease; to test a new ELISA or PCR for chronic
Chagas disease; to estimate any validity measure for
ELISA or PCR for chronic Chagas disease such as likeli￾hood ratios, accuracy, error rate, DOR, area under the
ROC (receiver operating characteristics) curve or predic￾tive values; to estimate intra-test variability (reliability)
of a PCR or ELISA for chronic Chagas disease. Abstracts
with unclear objectives, but which partially met any of
the criteria above, or with unclear objectives and had
any of the validity measure (as described above) as a
result, were also included.
Abstracts indicating that the investigation was neither
conducted with human volunteers nor with samples
from human beings, or indicating that the tests were
studied in a verification of cure scenario were not
included. Investigations concerning exclusively acute
infection or newborns, or with mixed data from acute
and chronically infected patients were excluded.
After full text retrieval the following criteria were
applied for quality evaluation and data extraction: (a)
investigations should be original (no reviews, editorials
or letters); (b) should be quantitative investigations; (c)
every investigation must have two samples (one repre￾senting those with chronic Chagas disease and one
representing those without chronic Chagas disease); (d)
must have results with enough data to allow extraction
(or calculation) of true positives, false negatives, false
positives and true negatives of each test. Only texts pub￾lished after 1980 were included. Although only abstracts
in English, Spanish or Portuguese were accepted, no lan￾guage restriction was applied to full text evaluation.
All diagnostic investigation phases were accepted.
Investigations were classified into these phases accord￾ing to Haynes [29]. Briefly, studies were classified as (1)
phase 1 if they compared results distributions of those
known to have disease with those known not to have
disease, usually in small samples in which selection was
done by convenience or by previous knowledge of Cha￾gas disease status; (2) as phase 2, if they estimated sensi￾tivity and specificity (or predictive values) from study
designed as case-control, that could also use the same
data from a phase one study; (3) as phase 3, those stu￾dies designed as cross-sectional with consecutive or ran￾dom selection of the volunteers, where the main
inclusion criteria is based on the suspected chronic Cha￾gas disease.
Index text and reference standard
The target condition of interest was chronic Chagas dis￾ease. Classifying Chagas disease according to infection
time (in acute and chronic) may be challenging. Usually
chronic Chagas disease means adults with long term
infection (ten years or longer), but the term may also be
applied to children, primarily with the indeterminate
form of the disease, with no history of acute fever
detected in the past two months. Original investigations
with children were also included if the authors did not
define their infection as either acute or chronic, and
there was no report of symptoms or signs compatible
with acute phase. Studies with children with one year
old or less were considered as acute infection studies.
All reference standards used by the authors of the ori￾ginal investigations were accepted. This was based on
the rationale that for a long time, there was no ‘gold
standard’ for Chagas disease diagnosis accepted among
all experts. However, two or more simultaneous serolo￾gical tests (with at least two different techniques) were
considered appropriate in the review quality assessment.
The index tests (tests under evaluation) of interest of
this research were ELISA, ELISA-rec and PCR.
From 1980 to 2010, ELISA technology has been widely
accepted and used due its automation and ease of use
(most of the tests are semi-automated). Its results are
less operator dependent, and are more readily available.
The basis of the test is to detect patient antibodies
against T. cruzi antigens. This serological test is a reac￾tion in which an enzyme gives a colorful result if the
serum sample has the target anti-body, and it is
recorded in optical densities.
The most interesting variation is the ELISA-rec. This
variation does not use antigens made from lysates of
whole parasites. Instead, its antigens (peptides) are con￾structed with recombinant technology. All variations
were included and discriminated.
PCR technique for Chagas disease is considered a
parasitological test such as thick or thin smear, xeno￾diagnosis or hemocultures, because the test relies on
amplification of DNA (Deoxyribonucleic acid) target
sequences. The test is based on the detection of T. cruzi
DNA sequences in patients’ blood samples.
There are different PCR techniques (qualitative meth￾ods) for detecting T. cruzi DNA in patients’ blood sam￾ples are: “Hot-Start PCR” (a modification of
conventional PCR that should reduce nonspecific ampli￾fication during the initial setup stages); “Nested-PCR”
(two step amplification often used for very low amount
of DNA targets); “Southern Blot” or “PCR and hybridi￾zation” (a procedure used to verify the presence or
absence of a specific nucleotide sequence in the DNA
from patients’ blood samples by a labeled hybridization
probe).
In some analysis, it is important to detect the amounts
of pathogens, so as to indicate the disease severity or to
monitor therapy outcome of infected patients. The Real￾Time PCR is based on the polymerase chain reaction
technology, used to amplify and simultaneously quantify
a targeted DNA molecule.

There are primers for two main target regions of T.
cruzi DNA amplification: nuclear satellite DNA (ns￾DNA) - a family of highly repetitive nuclear DNA
sequences named E13, that is distributed over most of
the parasite chromosomes;[30] and Kinetoplast DNA
(K-DNA) - part of the usual mitochondrial DNA found
in trypanosomes [31]. All these variations were included
and discriminated.
Review process
Research forms were designed and piloted for the pur￾pose of this review. Four blinded reviewers evaluated
abstracts and full text. One reviewer read and classified
all abstracts and eligible full text, and each one of the
remaining three reviewers reviewed and classified
approximately one third of the abstracts. Disagreement
among reviewers was resolved in consensus meetings
and tended to be inclusive if disagreement was persis￾tent. In a similar way, two blinded reviewers classified
and extracted each full and disagreement was solved in
a consensus meeting.
Methodological quality assessment
The methodological quality of each included investiga￾tion was also evaluated in a blinded fashion with QUA￾DAS tool (QUality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy
Studies) [32,33]. A consensus meeting was conducted to
confirm agreement and to resolve disagreement between
reviewers about this issue.
QUADAS is a checklist to help readers assess key
issues about quality of conducting and reporting of diag￾nostic test research, which will help in results interpre￾tation. Its interpretation is rather qualitative, making
comparison of quality only possible through individual
items. Overall scores or grades may not help quality
interpretation and are not recommended [34-36].
Data analysis plan
The statistical analysis was based on the following steps
(figure 1): (1) qualitative description of findings; (2)
search for the presence of heterogeneity and a threshold
effect; (3) exploring possible explanations for heteroge￾neity by sensitivity analysis; (4) statistical pooling. Tele￾Form® was used for data entry and analysis was carried
out with R-project software[37], with packages meta[38]
and DiagMeta [39].
One must understand heterogeneity as a greater varia￾tion of sensitivity, specificity or DOR between the
included studies than is compatible with the play of
chance. This statistical heterogeneity should represent
other sources of heterogeneity such as: clinical charac￾teristics, tests characteristics or research design charac￾teristics. It was decided a priory that sources of
heterogeneity investigation would be conducted by
sensitivity analysis, in other words, changing inclusion
and exclusion criteria for sub-group analysis, including
and excluding one by one of the information available
(shown in Additional file 1, Additional file 2 and Addi￾tional file 3 and others) such as: tests characteristics
(such as different antigens, different methods for esti￾mating the cut-off, different DNA region targets etc);
sample or populations characteristics (such as age range,
sex, location; if studied in blood donors); and design/
report characteristics, including QUADAS items (such
as the reference standard, blinding, if submitted to
ethics evaluation etc.). Study phase and whether the test
was commercially available were of particular interest.
Heterogeneity was explored with I2 estimate [40]. I2
measures up to 25% were considered low evidence of
heterogeneity, between 25% and 50% with moderate het￾erogeneity, and 50% or higher with high heterogeneity.
The I2 was estimated in the sensitivity, specificity and
DOR measures.
Threshold effect was investigated as a source of het￾erogeneity and to check if pooling summary ROC was
appropriate. It was defined as a positive correlation
among true positive rate (TPR) and false positive rate
(FPR) - or a negative correlation among sensitivity and
specificity - and was explored in a HSROC model (Hier￾archical Summary Receiver Operator Characteristics)
fitted by Maximum Likelihood (ML) and Monte Carlo
Markov Chain (MCMC) methods. If there was a moder￾ate to high heterogeneity, correlation was explored, and
if positive, a HSROC was estimated by principal compo￾nent of positive MCMC estimations[39] and plotted, if
negative or zero summary estimates were pooled with￾out HSROC [39].
Summaries estimates - Sensitivity (or True Positive
Rate) and 1- Specificity (or False Positive Rate) - were
pooled using the random bivariate model, with Laplace
method for Maximum Likelihood (ML) and Monte
Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) method [39]. Summary
DOR was estimated as the ratio of positive likelihood
ratio over negative likelihood ratio with DerSirmonian &
Laird random effect using the inverse variance technique
for sample size weight.
Results
Search results
From all five remote databases, 1349 abstracts were
retrieved. Following the removal of replicates, 713 were
found and evaluated (figure 1). After abstracts evalua￾tion only 183 were elected for retrieval of the full text.
Based on the strategy of email or telephone contact
with manufacturers or distributors, 15 out of 57
ANVISA registries were not used, either because some
were clearly not about ELISA tests or, in four cases,
because no email or phone contact could be found

either at ANVISA registries, or in the World Wide Web.
From this strategy only four returned the request.
Abbott-Brazil returned the operational manual for
‘Chagas Test ELISA III’, which was not considered a
report to be evaluated although there was some
sensitivity and specificity data. Lemos Laboratory
(Argentina) sent a reference published in 1998 con￾taining data from Polychaco/Biozima-Chagas, which
was subsequently found in the remote databases
search.

the sum of tests with data extracted is not equal to the total of full text included.

Ebram Laboratory returned the email stating that they
did not have any technical report at the time, and the
only validation process was executed by CGLAB (N° 03/
06) (Coordenação Geral de Laboratórios de Saúde Púb￾lica - or General Coordination of Public Health Labora￾tories, which is a coordination in the Brazilian
Epidemiologic Surveillance Department). http://portal.
saude.gov.br/portal/arquivos/pdf/nota_kit_chagas.pdf
However, this note could not be considered for evalua￾tion because there was no data for extraction and no
information to evaluate the quality of the investigation.
Orgenics sent a non-published report about the
‘ImmunoComb II Chagas Ab kit’. Although described as
a conventional ELISA, this test is formatted as a strip or
rapid test. Even described as a multicenter evaluation,
each center was considered a single report due to sev￾eral protocol differences in each center. This report was
the only one included from the manufacturer email con￾tact search strategy.
Another concerning issue is that five out of the twelve
commercial kits tested by CGLAB in 2006 were not
found in the ANVISA list of registered medical products
captured in 2007, nor were their reports found through
other search strategies.
Thirty three references, that were not captured by
remote databases search, were identified throughout bib￾liography of 2 narrative reviews[41,42] and other origi￾nal investigations. Therefore, there were 217 full texts
elected for assessment. (figure 1)
After applying inclusion/exclusion criteria, 114 texts
were excluded, 4 of them were discarded due duplicated
data in different reports by the same author - leaving
103 texts for data extraction. Several reports had data
from two or more tests simultaneously; therefore, there
were 115 regular ELISA reports[22,25,43-105] (Addi￾tional file 1), 49 ELISA-rec reports [22,23,61,76,
79,80,85,90,92,97,98,103,106-116] (Additional file 2) and
21 PCR reports[26,100,117-130] (Additional file 3), gen￾erating 185 tests results to analyze (figure 1).
Methodological quality of included studies
Quality of included original investigations was assessed
with QUADAS (Additional file 4). Only 8 (4.3%) investi￾gations were considered to have clear inclusion criteria.
Sixty three investigations (33.9%) were classified as
using a reference standard likely to correctly classify
Chagas disease. In 93 investigations (50.0%) it was clear
that the whole sample received verification using the
reference standard. In 106 investigations, it was clear
that patients received the reference standard regardless
of index text result. In 132 (71.0%) investigations, it was
clear that the reference standard was independent from
the index test. In 124 (66.7%) and 33 (17.7%) investiga￾tions, the index test and the reference standard
respectively were clearly described. In 22 (11.8%) stu￾dies, index test or reference standard blinding was cited,
but only in 18 (9.7%) were both included. In 20 (10.8%)
studies, inconclusive index test results appeared to be
omitted and in 19 (10.2%) withdrawals were not
explained.
Findings
There was a lot of information not available about clini￾cal characteristics and sample description of the 185
tests from original investigations. (Additional file 1,
Additional file 2 and Additional file 3) Only 20 (10.8%)
specified the recruitment period, 31 (16.7%) specified
the proportion of children in its sample, 28 (15.1%) spe￾cified the sex distribution, 32 (17.2%) specified age
range, in 69 (37.1%) it was not possible to determine if
there were blood donors in the sample, in 163 (87.6%)
and 167 (89.8) it was not possible to determine if people
living in rural or urban area respectively were included
in the sample, in 26 (14.0%) the sample was composed
exclusively of blood donors, in only 21 (11.3%) there
was some information about clinical characteristics such
as cardiac or digestive involvement, or disease severity,
and in 31 (16.7%) submission to review board and ethics
evaluation was reported
Eighty one investigations were conducted in Brazil, 24
in Argentina and the remaining were conducted in sev￾eral other countries in Latin America, USA or Spain. In
9 (4.8%), it was not possible to determine where the
protocol was conducted or from where included
patients/samples were.
Concerning only the ELISA group, two tests were
based on strip (rapid test) technology, in 76 (46.1%)
tests it was not specified how the cut-off was estimated
and only in 11 (6.7%) the cut-off estimation somehow
considered the distribution of results of those with the
target disease. In 143 (86.7%), it was not specified if
there was an inconclusive range; in 110 tests (66.7%),
the value of the cut-off was not specified.
In regular ELISA group, the strain used to extract
antigens for the test was not specified in 68 (58.2%), and
in all the commercial tests this information was not
available; in 59 (50.7%) tests the T. cruzi life cycle form
used as sources of antigens was not specified, and in 65
(56.0%) antigen purification was not specified or not
clear in the report.
From the 186 tests evaluated, only 60 (32.4%) were
specified to be commercially available. From these, 3
(5.0%) were classified as phase 1, 49 (81.7%) were classi￾fied as phase two, and only 8 (13.3%) were classified as
phase 3.
Concerning the PCR group (Additional file 3), one
protocol specified 3 blood samples collections from the
same patients, four did not inform how many samples
Brasil et al. BMC Infectious Diseases 2010, 10:337
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/10/337

were collected and the remaining collected one blood
sample; blood volume collected in each sample ranged
from 1 ml to 15 ml; six did not inform storage condi￾tion and none informed time gap between blood collec￾tion and DNA extraction; ten studies added guanidine
and boiled the blood samples before DNA extraction,
five studies added guanidine and did not boiled the
blood samples, five studies did not add guanidine
neither boiled before DNA extraction, and in one study
guanidine addition and boiling information was not
available; extracted volume from each sample ranged
from 100 μl to 500 μl and two studies did not inform
extraction volume; eighteen studies used phenol-chloro￾form, two used commercial kits for DNA extraction and
one did not inform DNA extraction procedure; eleven
did not inform inhibition control procedure; eight did
not inform contamination control procedure; only three
studies informed analytical sensitivity; fourteen studies
used primers aiming K-DNA and four studies used pri￾mers aiming ns-DNA; sixteen studies used protocols of
regular PCR, three studies used hybridization PCR, one
used a nested PCR and one used a real-time and nested
PCR; annealing temperature ranged from 55°C to 65°C.
All PCR tests were classified as in-house and 7 different
combinations of primers were used. (Additional file 5)
Heterogeneity within each of the three tests (ELISA,
ELISA-rec and PCR) was very high. (Additional file 6)
In none of the groups explored, heterogeneity was fully
explained. Also, threshold effect within the three tests
was absent, which makes HSROC estimates or compari￾son of curves between them not appropriate.
In the ELISA group, those tests that registered a
blinded evaluation of the reference standard (QUADAS
11 = Yes) had moderate heterogeneity in sensitivity,
moderate to high heterogeneity in specificity and little
evidence of heterogeneity in DOR. A threshold effect
was detected (Additional file 7) in this group and
HSROC was considered appropriate. (figure 2) Within
this subgroup, summary sensitivity and specificity were
97.7% and 96.3%, respectively. (Additional file 7)
Five commercial ELISA tests were classified as phase 3
and although there was high heterogeneity in sensitivity
and specificity, it was moderate in DOR. (Additional file
5) Figure 3 shows forest plots of this group and the
summary sensitivity was 94.3% and specificity was
99.9%. (Additional file 7)
Similar to ELISA group, heterogeneity was very high
in ELISA-rec. (Additional file 6). Within this group, only
three commercial tests were classified as phase 3. In
commercially available ELISA-rec tests investigated in
phase 3 studies, heterogeneity was high in specificity,
and low evidence was found in sensitivity and DOR.
Threshold effect was not estimated due to difficulties of
convergence of HSROC model, thus it was not
considered appropriate. Summary estimates by bivariate
random model are 99.2% and 97.5% for sensitivity and
specificity respectively (Additional file 7). Forest plots
for this subgroup are displayed in figure 4.
Analysis of a subgroup of commercial ELISA (regular
and recombinant) investigated in phase 3 studies that
used only blood donors in the sample demonstrated
that only six studies fit these criteria. Heterogeneity was
very high in all three measures and a threshold effect
was not detected.
PCR has a below desired sensitivity (probably between
50% and 90%) and very high specificity (probably very
close to 100%). Heterogeneity was very high and no
variable explored was able to explain it. In the three
validity estimates considered, I2 is always over 70.0%.
(Additional file 6) This means that from all available
data, there was not a particular PCR feature that could
explain the observed differences in PCR performance,
thus pooling summary estimates by any PCR character￾istics (such as DNA target region) was not considered
appropriate. However, a threshold effect was detected in
subgroups composed by two variables: test with samples
stored with guanidine (yes or no) and boiled before pro￾cessed (yes or no). In the three groups formed by this
combination, the heterogeneity still remained very high
in some pooled estimates. (Additional file 6) Sensitivity
and specificity summaries are displayed in Additional
file 7.
At first it seems that the group ‘stored with guanidine
and boiled’ has a better performance, with sensitivity of

92.2% and specificity of 97.7%, while the other two
groups have sensitivity close to 50% and specificity close
to 100%. However, the summary curve of the former
group is almost identical to the group ‘not stored with
guanidine and not boiled’ while accuracy is lower for
the group ‘stored with guanidine and not boiled’. (figure
5) Also, it seems that all three curves have smaller areas
when visually compared to the ELISA curve. (figure 2)
In the Chagas diagnostic literature there is a sense
that reliability of serological tests is less than the desired
level, however this review was able to identify only 7
investigations showing some result regarding reliability
and in all of them the estimates are in acceptable levels
(Additional file 1 and Additional file 2), and surprisingly
no reliability was formally tested in any PCR
investigation.
Discussion
In the beginning of this review there was an interest in
phase 3 investigations with commercially available tests,
which are believed to have results more easily
interpreted and are more readily available for use in
clinical practice. However, the attempt to include tech￾nical reports from commercially available tests was not
very successful, because only one non-published report
was accessed and it seems that some commercial tests
reports do not exist or are not accessible.
Recent Brazilian regulations states that medical pro￾ducts or devices do not need technical reports if they
are used in vitro - for example, used on any patient’s
material such as blood, sputum, urine etc. - although
they may be closely related to medical decision making.
We wonder why technical reports are not available from
regulatory register. Despite the reasons, their ability to
correctly identify those with and without Chagas disease
is unknown for those who use those tests in clinical
practice.
Because of some perceptions during the review, such
as: few phase three investigations; few commercial tests
investigations sponsored by manufacturers; reports pub￾lished mainly in immunology and parasitology journals;
absence of products monographs or technical reports; as

well as the amount of missing information is consider￾ably higher in the commercial tests reports; it seems
that in this field there is a considerable gap between the
academic production, manufacturer interests and clinical
practice.
Methodological quality of original reports was assessed
through QUADAS tool. A careful reader would soon
understand that QUADAS was developed to evaluate
investigations in a more clinical scenario, for example,
phase 3 investigations. Several issues such as gold stan￾dard description, inclusion and exclusion criteria and
blinding assessment are perhaps less important in phase
2 than in phase 3, therefore the use of QUADAS could
give a more strong impression of poor quality of the
included investigations in this review, since the majority
of original investigations were classified as phase 2.
The overall impression regarding methodological qual￾ity of included reports in this review is that poor quality
of reporting is mixed with poor quality of investigations
in most cases. This impression does not come solely
from the level of “uncertainty” in QUADAS evaluation,
but also from the amount of missing information about
sample description and test description. Even in those
investigations classified as phase 3, very few seem to fol￾low current recommended standards for report formats
[131].
Serological tests were seldom formally evaluated in
phase three investigations with samples exclusively from
blood donors. Although screening occurs in a different
setting from diagnosis in clinical practice, the same tests
are used and therefore the same problems are also
found, such as high heterogeneity, and absence of a
threshold effect. Particularly, in blood banks, the infor￾mation about cut-off would be important because its
variation may be a simple mean by which test accuracy
could be improved. However, none of the phase three
studies using exclusively blood donors described which
test cut-off was used.
ELISA test results are generated as optical densities,
which are presented as a continuous scale. However,
none specified the area under the ROC curve (which is
considered an accuracy measure independent from the

cut-off used), and very few investigations used strategies
to estimate a good cut-off considering both the distribu￾tion of results of those with and without the target dis￾ease, such as maximizing Youden’s index. The majority
of specified cut-off, when specified, was estimated by
strategies such as ‘mean of negative controls plus 2
standard deviations’, which may maximize specificity but
completely ignores sensitivity.
It is known that, similar to other infectious agents,
there are differences of circulating strains in different
geographic regions in Latin America [132]. Authors

showed that commercial tests may have worst perfor￾mances when compared to in-house tests with antigens
made from local T. cruzi strains. There were some mul￾ticenter studies included in this review but the informa￾tion about the antigen geographic source or stratified
analysis by center was sparse, turning impossible to
explore this issue as source of heterogeneity.
In Chagas diagnostic literature, researchers have
repeatedly said that there is a lack of reliability or agree￾ment of serological tests based on imperfect kappa esti￾mated between different tests or laboratories
[22-25,67,89,95,135]. Therefore, there is a difference of
conceptions when comparing reliability definitions in
general statistics[136] or diagnostic test methodology lit￾erature,[131] where instrument variability concerns the
amount of variation that arises during the operation of
devices or systems, such as automated laboratory mea￾surements. Other terms for this form of variation
include imprecision, reproducibility, analytic methodolo￾gical variation, or analytical noise (error) and sometimes
calibration [137]. Because this review did not find high
intra-test variability of ELISA test, there is no evidence
to support the lack of reliability statement.
It appears that there is no widely accepted PCR test
protocol, since none of the tests found in literature used
identical protocols. This may indicate that the PCR for
T. cruzi is difficult to standardize and perhaps all proto￾cols used are prone to some unacceptable procedure
errors for clinical diagnosis. Most PCR protocols still
use phenol-chloroform for DNA extraction instead of
available commercial kits. (Additional file 3) Phenol￾chloroform has biohazards issues and is no longer
recommended for use in clinical laboratory routine or in
hospital settings.
Also, primers aiming K-DNA were the most fre￾quently used. Although these primers aim at conserved
regions within K-DNA, the amplified region is consid￾ered hypervariable[138] leading to variations in the
amplicon sizes. A possible problem with the K-DNA,
which was seldom investigated, is that the primer
annealing sequences are conserved within Kinestoplas￾tida order [138]. However, sequence alignment of “121”
and “122” analysis by comparing the “121” and “122”
primers sequence with T. rangeli homologous region
(GeneBank: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov - access num￾ber: L28038.1) showed that these primers cannot effi￾ciently amplify the target from this specie due to
mismatches in the 3’ end of the primer, therefore the
possibility of T. rangeli miss-amplification is remote.
The different primer sequences used in the molecular
tests could be responsible for the observed test hetero￾geneity. There was seven different set of primers used in
the twenty one included studies. Most studies applied
primer sequences targeted to K-DNA and ns-DNA. The
intention is to increase analytical sensitivity, as these are
repetitive regions in T. cruzi DNA. Also, primers for K￾DNA are slight modifications from one another within
the same target region, which suggests that these pri￾mers may have limitations for T. cruzi DNA
amplification.
It was not possible to explore the observed variation
of primers as source of heterogeneity due to the number
of groups that used different sets of primers, and some
primers were used only once. This review did not find
any evidence of superior analytical sensitivity of a parti￾cular primer while most of the included studies did not
report this information.
Some authors stated that there is no clear advantage
and there are some disadvantages in using guanidine
over EDTA before extraction [139,140]. In hospital set￾tings where samples could be processed, and DNA
could be extracted in the very same day, perhaps this
would no longer be necessary. Boiling the blood sample
before DNA extraction was also commonly described. It
has been shown that boiling during 15 minutes disrupts
the K-DNA minicircle nets, thus facilitating the homo￾geneous distribution of minicircle molecules in all the
volume of Guanidine-EDTA treated sample and improv￾ing primer annealing to the templates, thus allowing
processing of small volumes with high sensitivity. How￾ever, his review did not find evidence that this proce￾dure increases PCR performance.
PCR success depends on the amount of circulating
parasites in patients’ blood stream. T. cruzi circulates in
very small amounts at the chronic phase and dynamics
about its circulation is not predictable [141,142]. It is
possible that, even if a patient is infected, the collected
sample does not have an adequate amount of the para￾site DNA leading the test to a negative or undetectable
result. A possible solution to this limitation is the collec￾tion of several serial blood samples at different times
[126] or increasing the blood volume per test may over￾come this problem.
Although this review has not intended to evaluate any
test to assess parasitological cure of Chagas disease, in
recent literature addressing this issue there is much dis￾cussion about PCR techniques for detecting trypanocidal
therapy outcome, primarily the real-time PCR [143,144].
This reflects the fact that serological markers and clini￾cal disease progression may take decades to be observed.
However, this review found no evidence that PCR tests
are adequate to correctly identify (mainly) the presence
of T. cruzi DNA. Perhaps PCR tests could be a suitable
tool to detect therapy outcome, in particular therapy
failure, but this remains to be evaluated in prospective
studies.
In 2007, TDR (a Special Program for Research and
Training in Tropical Diseases) launched an international
Brasil et al. BMC Infectious Diseases 2010, 10:337
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/10/337
Page 11 of 17

multicenter study to standardize PCR procedures with a
panel of samples. The results of such study were ana￾lyzed in a workshop with experts in which consensus
recommendations to run PCR for T. cruzi were formu￾lated. This can be assessed in http://apps.who.int/tdr/
svc/publications/tdrnews/issue-82/meeting-chagas. Its
clinical usefulness, however still remains to be evaluated.
Review limitations
The main limitations of this review are: (1) inability to
find unpublished technical reports from tests commer￾cially available, therefore this review may not represent
all ELISA tests or might have biased results; (2) sum￾mary estimates were pooled from selected subgroups
where heterogeneity was partially explained, therefore
interpretation of results are less straight forward then a
result where heterogeneity is absent.
The quality of a systematic review is also influenced
by the original investigations’ quality. It is likely that
other items not explored by this review could explain
the observed heterogeneity. Examples of these items are:
data collection period; proportion of children in sample;
sex distribution in sample; sample median age; age
range; if volunteers were from rural or urban area; geo￾graphical origin of volunteers; Chagas disease clinical
presentation such as cardiac or intestinal involvement;
ELISA generation; methods of preparations of antigens,
buffers or brand of plates; type of antibodies used; how
cut-off was estimated; indeterminate range; T. cruzi life
cycle form (epimastigote, trypomastigote etc) used as
source of antigen; geographical areas of the strains used
as source of antigens; inhibition control for PCR, con￾tamination control for PCR, time gap between sample
collection and DNA extraction, maintenance condition
of the sample; polymerase trademarks; type of hybridiza￾tion technique (colorimetric or radioactive); primer var￾iation; inhibition
Many of these characteristics were not explored as
heterogeneity source because of the amount of original
investigations that did not report them, but other made
sensitive analysis difficult because many subgroups had
a single study.
Conclusions
ELISA and ELISA-rec performances are good. Their
reliability is within acceptable ranges although not often
studied. These findings lead to the conclusion that
recommendations to use two simultaneous serological
tests is based on mistrust in recommending a single test
that will fail very occasionally, or on a misunderstanding
of the reliability concept of diagnostic tests. Both ELISA
and ELISA-rec could be used as a single test for chronic
Chagas disease diagnosis, but caution is necessary while
some commercial tests technical reports were not
assessed by this review, thus they were not included and
their performance are not known.
This review results about PCR test are less conclusive
then ELISA, thus more difficult to interpret. Besides
strong evidence of heterogeneity, only one study was
classified as phase 3. Currently PCR performance is
below desired and its reliability has not been character￾ized. Visual comparison of the area under the summary
ROC curves for ELISA and PCR indicates that ELISA
has better performance than PCR. At this point, PCR
test cannot be considered a tool for diagnosis of chronic
Chagas disease in clinical practice.
Final considerations
There are many investigations about chronic Chagas
disease diagnosis since 1980, however little knowledge
reached clinical practice with current recommended
standards up to 2009. Phase 3 investigations and com￾mercial tests detailed reports are necessary, and they
should follow standard report format,[131] always mak￾ing explicit: test reliability (intra-test agreement); if
reference standard and index test were blinded to each
other; volunteer selection strategy, mainly if it was based
on clinical suspicion of disease or not; clear description
of clinical characteristics of the volunteers; the cut-off
used and indeterminate range of the test and how they
were estimated; also, always include key issues of test
protocol, such as strains used in antigens development,
or which strains would the recombinant antigens could
represent, and antigen purification. Regulatory agencies
would make a great step forward if diagnostic tests’
technical reports would be always necessary for product
registry and always available to the public.
Besides the quality of reports and design of diagnostic
research, there are points that could be addresses to
improve tests in the future. Serological tests could have
a set of recombinant or crude antigens combination
which could equally detect different T. cruzi strains
from distant geographic areas, in order to have similar
performance with patients from different locations. The
development and improvement of strip tests, or portable
tests, may be very useful, while the majority of patients
may be at distant rural areas where health care access is
difficult. Also, Chagas disease pathophysiolgy further
understanding may help to improve serological tests
while these tests aim to detect patient’s antibodies, thus
there are patients’ characteristics that may influence ser￾ological tests performances.
Concerning PCR, much more is yet to be done. Incor￾poration of modern techniques already available for
PCR to other diseases diagnosis (for example: HBV, HIV
and tuberculosis), such as commercial DNA extraction
kits, real-time and other techniques that could make the
test more automated should be encouraged. In addition,
Brasil et al. BMC Infectious Diseases 2010, 10:337
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/10/337
Page 12 of 17

research on updated DNA sequence for PCR primers
design and use of multiple primer sets including multi￾plex PCR test and primers aiming to parasite’s DNA
inserted into host genome should be encouraged. Also,
it is expected that performing a serial tests in a patient
and defining the diagnosis after assembling all the
results would increase test sensitivity.
