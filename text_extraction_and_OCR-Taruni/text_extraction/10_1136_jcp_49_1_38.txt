Increased dimeric IgA producing B cells in the
bone marrow in IgA nephropathy determined
by in situ hybridisation for J chain mRNA
S J Harper, A C Allen, J H Pringle, J Feehally
Abstract
Aim-To investigate the possible role of
the systemic IgA immune system in the
pathogenesis of IgA nephropathy
Methods-J chain mRNA expression in the
IgA cells of the bone marrow was studied.
Bone marrow trephine biopsy specimens
from seven patients with IgA nephropathy
and seven matched controls were ex￾amined by (1) non-isotopic in situ
hybridisation (ISH) and (2) combined
immunofluorescence and non-isotopic
ISH to identify the plasma cell type. Serum
polymeric IgA was also determined using
standard high pressure liquid chro￾matography and sandwich enzyme linked
immunosorbent assay.
Results-Non-isotopic ISH revealed a
similar number ofJ chain mRNA positive
cellslunit length in biopsy specimens from
patients (16.5 + 2-7 cells/mm) and controls
(17.7 + 2 4 cells/mm). Combined immuno￾fluorescence and ISH revealed a greater
proportion of J chain mRNA positive IgA
cells in patients (7-6+1-45%) compared
with controls (3 + 0.8%). Serum polymeric
IgA was similar in both patients
(91 + 22 mgIl) and controls (77 + 24 mg/l).
Conclusion-These data suggest that ex￾cess production of dimeric IgA occurs in
the bone marrow in IgA nephropathy.

IgA nephropathy is a common form of glo￾merulonephritis characterised by the mesangial
deposition of IgA1.'` The molecular nature of
the deposited IgAl remains contentious but
there is good evidence to support the view that
a significant proportion of it is dimeric al chain
positive)."6 Mesangial deposition of dimeric
IgA is thought to occur based on the large body
of evidence detailing abnormal polymeric IgA
biology in IgA nephropathy.'
IgA is the immunoglobulin of mucosal de￾fence. The elevated concentrations of serum
polymeric IgA8 and the clinical association of
mucosal infection and macroscopic haematuria
in IgA nephropathy led to the view that me￾sangial IgA originated in the mucosal IgA sys￾tem, and that the deposited immunoglobulin
resulted from an exaggerated IgA response,
either innate to the mucosal system or sec￾ondary to environmental influences.9"
Two tissues from the mucosal immune sys￾tem have been available for study in IgA ne￾phropathy-tonsils and intestinal mucosa. The
intestinal mucosa contains a smaller proportion
of IgA plasma cells in IgA nephropathy com￾pared with normal mucosa,"213 and our pre￾vious work on duodenal IgA plasma cell J chain
mRNA expression has suggested a shift away
from dimeric IgA production at this site.13
These data suggest that the site of hyper￾responsive IgA biology in IgA nephropathy
is unlikely to be the intestinal lamina propria.
In contrast, increased numbers of IgA cells
have been identified in tonsils"4-17 and increased
J chain expression has been reported in tonsillar
IgA cells.' '6 Although these reports were
based on potentially non-specific antibody
techniques, we have recently confirmed this
finding using in situ hybridisation for J chain
mRNA (unpublished data). There is therefore
good evidence for a shift towards dimeric IgA
production in the tonsils in IgA nephropathy.
However, it is difficult to accept that the tonsils
are the only site of deranged dimeric IgA func￾tion in IgA nephropathy, as although ton￾sillectomy may reduce the frequency of
macroscopic haematuria (and also of mucosal
infection), the procedure is not curative.
Furthermore, IgA nephropathy does occur
in patients who have had a tonsillectomy as
children. An alternative view proposed by van
den Wall Bake et al'8 is that mesangial IgA
derives from the systemic (bone marrow) IgA
system. This is supported by elevated IgA
plasma cell counts in bone marrow aspirates
from patients with IgA nephropathy. We have
recently confirmed this finding in bone marrow
trephine biopsy specimens from patients and
matched controls. 9 Although bone marrow IgA
cell J chain expression in IgA nephropathy
has been studied,20 two colour immuno￾fluorescence techniques were used, using a J
chain antibody which others have found to be
non-specific, demonstrating a tendency to bind
to immunoglobulin light chains (Dr M Kerr,
University of Dundee, Scotland, unpublished
observations).
Here, we describe an in situ hybridisation
study of J chain mRNA expression within the
bone marrow IgA plasma cells of patients with
IgA nephropathy to address whether the bone
marrow is an additional source of excess di￾meric IgA production in IgA nephropathy. The
concentrations of polymeric IgA within the
serum of patients and controls were also de￾termined to assess any potential correlation
between serum concentrations and marrow cell
profile.

Bone marrow J chain expression in IgA nephropathy
Methods
Bone marrow trephine biopsy specimens were
obtained from seven patients with confirmed
IgA nephropathy (six men and one woman,
mean age 45 years, range 35-55 years). None of
the patients had macroscopic haematuria at the
time of biopsy, six had microscopic haematuria
and two had proteinuria. All patients had normal
serum creatinine concentrations.
Control samples for bone marrow studies
were derived from age and sex matched vo￾lunteers (mean age 45-9 years, range 34-59
years), undergoing minor surgery under general
anaesthetic.
Collection ofbone marrow biopsy specimens
from a small number of controls and patients
was approved by the Leicester Health Authority
Ethical Committee. Sample collection was
from willing volunteers who gave informed con￾sent. These samples were identical with those
studied previously in that biopsy specimens
from the patients had increased numbers of
IgA and IgAl cells.'9 Biopsy was performed
under local anaesthetic (2% lignocaine to skin
and periosteum). Bone marrow samples were
taken from the posterior superior iliac spine.
After collection, the trephine specimens were
immersed in 10% formol saline for 48 hours.
Following fixation, all specimens were de￾calcified (EDTA, pH 7 0, 48 hours), processed
and embedded in paraffin wax as for normal
histology. Processed samples were then coded.
A blood sample was taken at the time of biopsy
and the serum stored.
PROBE AND PROBE LABELLING
Deoxyoligonucleotides (unlabelled sequences
were kindly donated by Pathway Services Ltd,
Leicester, UK) complementary to J chain
mRNA2' were 3' end labelled with the nuc￾leotide analogue digoxigenin-1 -dUTP using
a labelling kit (Boehringer Mannheim, Mann￾heim, Germany). The labelling reaction was
performed at 37°C for two hours in 100 gl
volumes. The labelling reaction mixture was as
follows: 200 ng probe cocktail; 10 gl1 10mM
MnCl2; 2 3 gl 1 mM digoxigenin-1 1-dUTP;
20 gl 5 x buffer; and 1 ,ul terminal deoxy￾nucleotidyl transferase. Labelled probe was
then purified through Sephadex G50 spun col￾umns and labelling confirmed by test filters.
All deoxyoligonucleotides were 30 bases long;
this length has been established as a practical
compromise among hybrid stability, hybrid
specificity, cost of synthesis and purification,
and tissue penetration efficiency.22
NON-ISOTOPIC ISH
The protocol for non-isotopic ISH on de￾calcified tissue was adapted from techniques
we have previous reported for use with paraffin
wax embedded, non-decalcified specimens.22 25
RNase free reagents and glassware (di￾ethylpyrocarbonate (DEPC) treated; Sigma,
Poole, Dorset, UK) were used throughout.
Slides were dewaxed with fresh xylene (2 x 3
minutes) and rehydrated through industrial
methylated spirit (IMS) 99% (2 x 3 minutes),
IMS 95% (2 x 3 minutes). Pretreatments in￾cluded protein digestion with proteinase K
(2-10 jig/ml). Samples were post-fixed with
0-4% paraformaldehyde in 1 x phosphate
buffered saline (PBS)/DEPC for 10 minutes,
and then acetylated with 0-25% acetic an￾hydride. Slides were then washed in DEPC
water and returned to 1 x PBS/DEPC. Slides
were hybridised overnight at 37°C after a 15
minute "hot-start" at 900C (to destroy en￾dogenous alkaline phosphatase). Hybridisation
solution contained 20 ng/ml probe, 600 mM
NaCl, 50 mM Tris (pH 7 5), 0-2% bovine
serum albumin, 1% sodium dodecylsulphate
(SDS), 1% polyvinylpyrrolidone (40 kDa), 1%
Ficoll (400 kDa), 0- 1% sodium pyrophosphate,
5 mM EDTA, 10% dextran sulphate, and 30%
formamide.
Posthybridisation washes were as follows:
2 x standard saline citrate solution (SSC;
150 mM NaCl, 15 mM trisodium citrate,
pH 7 0.)/30% formamide (2 x 10 minutes);
2 x SSC at room temperature (2 x 10 minutes);
and 15 minutes in neat sheep serum. Slides
were incubated with alkaline phosphatase
labelled sheep polyclonal digoxigenin antibody
(Boehringer Mannheim) diluted 1 in 600 in
sheep serum for 30 minutes. Specimens were
then washed in blocking solution, tri￾ethanolamine buffered saline, 0 1% Triton-X￾100, 3% bovine serum albumin (2 x 5 min￾utes), immersed in buffer 3 (0 1 M Tris/HCl
(pH 9-5), 01 M NaCl, 0 05 M MgCl2) (1 x 10
minutes), and in substrate solution overnight
(44 gl nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) (Sigma,
75 mg/ml in 70% dimethylformamide), 33 p1
5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (BCIP)
(Sigma, 50 mg/ml in dimethylformamide) in
10 ml buffer 3). Finally, sections were washed
in running tap water for 10 minutes, coun￾terstained with Mayer's haematoxylin and
mounted in aqueous mounting medium.
COMBINED IMMUNOFLUORESCENCE AND NON-
-ISOTOPIC ISH
The protocol for combined immuno￾fluorescence and non-isotopic ISH was adapted
from that reported previously for use on non￾decalcified paraffin wax embedded tissue23 and
was identical with the non-isotopic technique
described above up to the detection step. A
fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) labelled
polyclonal rabbit antihuman IgA antibody
(Dako, High Wycombe, UK) was used (diluted
1 in 20) in conjunction with the antidigoxigenin
antibody. Specimens were then incubated with
a secondary antirabbit polyclonal anti-FITC
(Dako) (diluted 1 in 50 in blocking solution) for
30 minutes. Alkaline phosphatase development
was then performed. Slides were finally in￾cubated with an FITC labelled polyclonal
swine antirabbit antibody (Dako) diluted 1 in
25 with blocking solution. After final washing,
uncounterstained slides were mounted in aque￾ous mounting medium.
IgA plasma cells were then visualised under
ultraviolet light (490 nm, green). Coexpression
of J chain mRNA could then be determined by
alteration to bright field illumination under
which J chain mRNA positive cells could be
observed (blue/black).

CONTROLS AND EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
Specificity ofthe J chain mRNA signal was con￾firmed by the use of appropriate negative con￾trols on each section as previously listed. These
were omission ofprobe, omission ofdigoxigenin
antibody, RNase Al pretreatment controls, ran￾dom oligonucleotide cocktail similarly labelled
(unlabelled sequences kindly donated by Path￾way Services Ltd), in addition to a non-ho￾mologous oligonucleotide cocktail with the
same G-C content as the J chain probe.22-25
SERUM POLYMERIC IgA
Serum IgA was measured by radial im￾munodiffusion as previously reported.'9 Per￾centage monomeric and polymeric IgA
concentrations in serum samples were es￾timated. Serum samples were passed through
a Superose 6 gel filtration column on a high
pressure liquid chromatography system using
phosphate buffer, and fractions containing
polymeric and monomeric IgA were collected.
This procedure was calibrated using com￾mercially purified IgA myeloma proteins (The
Binding Site, Birmingham, UK). IgA con￾centrations in the fractions were measured by
sandwich enzyme linked immunosorbent assay
as described previously.26
MICROSCOPY
Ultraviolet microscopy was performed using a
Nikon Optiphot microscope. After initial study
with non-isotopic ISH alone all J chain mRNA
positive cells within each biopsy specimen were
counted. The length ofeach biopsy specimen was
then measured directly using an eyepiece grat￾icule and low magnification. After simultaneous
non-isotopic ISH and immunofluorescence each
IgA cell within the specimen was examined in
turn in a systematic manner under ultraviolet
light (490 nm) with the aid of a grid-graticule.
Expression of J chain mRNA was then de￾termined by viewing the cell under bright field
illumination. Cells were counted by a single ob￾server on coded specimens, thus blinding the ob￾server to the source of each specimen.

STATISTICS
Data were analysed using the unpaired t test
and Wilcoxon/Mann-Whitney U analysis. Un￾less stated, figures and results are expressed
as mean+standard error of mean. Clearly, it
should be remembered that the small sample
size means that there is a low statistical power
to detect a difference between the groups.
Results
NON-ISOTOPIC ISH
Well defined NBT/BCIP sites of hybridisation
were seen in cells in all control and patient
bone marrow trephine specimens. Background
staining was negligible and morphology was
well preserved on all occasions. Negative con￾trols did not yield a signal on any occasion. In
contrast to both duodenal mucosa13 and tonsil
(manuscript submitted), in which the dis￾tribution of J chain mRNA expressing cells
demonstrated a predictable distribution, mar￾row J chain mRNA positive cells have an ap￾parently random distribution (fig 1).
Enumeration of the absolute numbers of J
chain mRNA positive cells within each biopsy
specimen revealed a similar number of cells
per unit length in both control (17-7 + 2-4 cells/
mm) and patient (16-5 + 2-7 cells/mm) samples
(p=NS) (fig 2).
COMBINED NON-ISOTOPIC ISH AND
IMMUNOFLUORESCENCE
Monomeric (cytoplasmic IgA positive, J chain
mRNA negative) and dimeric (cytoplasmic IgA
positive, J chain mRNA positive) IgA cells were
readily distinguished using this technique (fig 3).
A greater proportion of IgA plasma cells were
J chain mRNA positive in patient (7-1 + 1-45%)
compared with control (3 + 0-8%) trephine bi￾opsy specimens (p<004) (fig 4).

ISH on decalcified tissue is hampered by the
fact that mRNA tends to degrade during the
decalcification process. Our preliminary studies
suggested that decalcification with EDTA at
neutral pH gave much better results than de￾calcification with acid, confirming the previous
findings of other authors.27 We also found that
non-isotopic ISH on bone marrow trephine
biopsy specimens produced a significant
amount ofbackground staining, which was only
eliminated after the addition of an acetylation
step to the specimen pretreatment protocol and
incubation ofthe antidigoxigenin antibody with
sheep serum during the detection step. We have
found the technique robust and reliable on
tissue up to four years old.

We found no correlation between the pro￾portion of dimeric IgA marrow cells and serum
polymeric IgA. The reason for this is unclear
but may relate to the fact that some serum
polymeric IgA exists as aggregated (j chain
free) monomers. Any association between
dimer producing IgA cells and serum dimeric
IgA may therefore be masked by the presence of J chain free IgA macromolecules. Alternatively,
the abnormal concentrations of serum poly￾meric IgA in IgA nephropathy may derive from
another site-for example, tonsils or spleen, or
the lack of any association may simply reflect
the small numbers of patients studied. Al￾though it would have been preferable to study a larger population, bone marrow biopsy speci￾mens can only be taken from willing volunteers
with informed consent. Not unexpectedly, the
number of volunteers was small.
Nevertheless, this study provides new in￾formation about abnormal dimeric IgA biology
in IgA nephropathy. The findings mirror those
in the tonsil (manuscript submitted) and are
the complete opposite of those in the duodenal
lamina propria. IgA is
a very
T cell dependent
isotype.
J chain mRNA expression is or￾chestrated by T cell products.2829 The abnormal
patterns of IgA and
J chain mRNA expression
in these three tissues may reflect an abnormality
of
T cell control, perhaps as
a result of defective
T cell trafficking or innate abnormalities of
a
T cell population. We recently reported an
abnormality of IgA affinity maturation in IgA
nephropathy, another
T cell dependent func￾tion."0
Under normal circumstances the mucosal
and systemic IgA systems are believed to be
related but distinct." We have now described
abnormalities in
J chain mRNA expression in
both systems. These findings add to the number
of abnormalities of both systems described by
others."214-820 Collectively, these findings raise
the possibility that in IgA nephropathy there is
an imbalance in the putative mucosa-marrow
immune axis, well recognised in mice'2 but yet
to be characterised in man, resulting in an
exaggerated overlap between the two systems.
In conclusion, combined non-isotopic ISH
and immunofluorescence can be used to detect
simultaneously mRNA and cytoplasmic pro￾tein, respectively, in decalcified specimens. We
have used this method to demonstrate an ab￾normal shift towards dimeric IgA production
within the systemic IgA immune system. This
underlines immune abnormalities within the
bone marrow in IgA nephropathy and high￾lights the bone marrow as a possible source of
the raised serum concentrations of polymeric
IgA and deposited dimeric IgA, which is char￾acteristic of this form of glomerular disease.
