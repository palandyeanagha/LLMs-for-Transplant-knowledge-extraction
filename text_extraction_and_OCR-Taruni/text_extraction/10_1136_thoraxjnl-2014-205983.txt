ABSTRACT
Background Individuals with chronic diseases and
parent caregivers are at increased risk for symptoms of
depression and anxiety. Prevalence of psychological
symptoms was evaluated in adolescents and adults with
cystic fibrosis (CF) and parent caregivers across nine
countries.
Methods Patients with CF, ages 12 years and older,
and caregivers of children with CF, birth to18 years of
age, completed measures of depression and anxiety
across 154 CF centres in Europe and the USA.
Psychological symptoms were compared across countries
using χ2
. Logistic regression examined extent of
comorbid symptoms, predictors of depression and
anxiety, and concordance between parent and
adolescent symptomatology.
Results Psychological symptoms were reported by
6088 patients with CF and 4102 parents. Elevated
symptoms of depression were found in 10% of
adolescents, 19% of adults, 37% of mothers and 31%
of fathers. Elevations in anxiety were found in 22% of
adolescents, 32% of adults, 48% of mothers and 36%
of fathers. Overall, elevations were 2–3 times those of
community samples. Participants reporting elevated
anxiety were more likely to report depression (ORs:
adolescents=14.97, adults=13.64, mothers=15.52,
fathers=9.20). Significant differences in reports of
depression and anxiety were found by patient age and
parent respondent. Concordance between 1122 parent–
teen dyads indicated that adolescents whose parents
reported depression were more likely to be elevated on
depression (OR=2.32). Similarly, adolescents whose
parents reported anxiety were more likely to score in the
elevated range on the anxiety measure (OR=2.22).
Conclusions Symptoms of depression and anxiety were
elevated in both patients with CF and parents across
several European countries and the USA. Annual
screening of psychological symptoms is recommended for
both patients and parents.
INTRODUCTION
Meta-analyses and systematic reviews have indi￾cated that children and adults with chronic dis￾eases, as well as parent caregivers, are at increased
risk for depression and anxiety.1–3 Cystic fibrosis
(CF) is the most common genetic, life-limiting
chronic disease among Caucasian populations and
requires a treatment regimen that takes between 2
and 4 h per day.4 Patients have genetic mutations
that affect the CF transmembrane conductance
regulator protein, leading to thick mucus secre￾tions, repeated infections and progressive failure of
most organ systems (e.g., lungs, pancreas, digestive,
reproductive).5 Although recent advances in diag￾nosis and treatment have led to increases in life￾span, CF continues to be one of the most difficult
chronic conditions to manage.6
Studies evaluating depression and anxiety in
patients with CF have generally found a high
prevalence of psychological distress. Rates of
depression in children and adolescents have ranged
from 9% to 29%, using different methods of
assessment (ICD-10 diagnoses, Children’s

Key messages
What is the key question?
▸ What is the prevalence of symptoms of
depression and anxiety in adolescents and
adults with cystic fibrosis (CF) and parents of
children with CF, ages from birth to 17 years, in
an international study across 9 countries using
standardised screening measures?
What is the bottom line?
▸ Significant elevations in symptoms of
depression and anxiety were found among
patients and parent caregivers across countries,
suggesting that screening for symptoms of
depression and anxiety should be performed
annually and addressed systematically.
Why read on?
▸ This is the largest international screening study
performed in a chronic respiratory disease and
has led to the creation of an international
guidelines committee to formulate
recommendations leading to a change in
medical practice.

Depression Inventory).7 For adults with CF, rates of depression
have ranged from 13% to 30%8 9 and rates of anxiety from
30% to 33%.8 10 Among parent caregivers, elevations in psy￾chological distress have also been found, with depression
ranging from 20% to 35%.7 11 12 Overall, psychological symp￾toms appear to be higher in this population than community
samples13; however, these studies have been limited by small
sample sizes and different screening or diagnostic tools, which
have made interpretation of the results difficult. Additionally,
the majority of studies have only assessed symptoms of depres￾sion but not anxiety.
Psychological distress in patients with CF has been associated
with a number of negative consequences and health outcomes,
including worse adherence,7 14 worse pulmonary function,10 15
increased hospitalisations and healthcare costs,16 and decreased
health-related quality of life.8 9 A recent study16 compared ado￾lescents with CF who had been diagnosed with a depressive dis￾order with a matched sample of non-depressed teens with CF,
and found that those who were depressed were three times
more likely to be hospitalised for a pulmonary exacerbation,
and incurred much higher healthcare costs over 2 years (US
$280 000 for the depressed group vs. US$60 116 for the non￾depressed group). Given both the wide range of prevalence esti￾mates for patients with CF and their caregivers, and the negative
impact these symptoms have on disease management and func￾tioning, The International Depression Epidemiological Study
group aimed to screen depression and anxiety in several
European countries and the USA. Two screening measures were
used to assess these symptoms in both adolescents and adults
with CF and parent caregivers. Predictors of psychological
symptoms, both demographic and medical, were also identified,
comorbidity of depression and anxiety was estimated and con￾cordance between parents and children was evaluated.
METHODS
Procedure
This study was conducted at 154 CF centres in nine countries:
Belgium, Germany, Italy, Spain, Sweden, The Netherlands,
Turkey, the UK and the USA. The protocol was developed by a
consortium of investigators over a 2-year period, with discus￾sions each year in Europe and the USA to refine the protocol.
Investigators then applied for funding from their country’s
respective patient with CF or research foundations, with 7 out
of 9 countries obtaining small grants. Although the procedures
and data collection were standardised to a great extent, some
countries chose to use only one screening tool for depression
(i.e., Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale; HADS) because it
was widely used in their country17 (note that the HADS is not
used in the USA). Five out of the nine countries used both the
HADS and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression
Scale (CES-D). Screening was initiated in patients aged 12 years
through adulthood and in parents of children from birth to
18 years of age. Study protocols were approved by national and
local ethics committees or institutional review boards at all CF
centres.
Staff members approached participants at routine, stable,
clinic visits. After completion of consent/assent, patients or
parents completed a basic demographic questionnaire in add￾ition to the screening measures. When both parents were
present, they completed the symptom measures independently.
Depression and anxiety screening measures were scored immedi￾ately by trained staff members to identify clinically elevated
scores; referrals were provided if necessary. Completion of the
measures took approximately 15 min. Medical data were col￾lected through chart review.
Participants
Across nine countries, 1286 adolescents (mean age=14.84
years, SD=1.69) and 4739 adults (mean age=28.87 years,
SD=9.5) with CF were screened. Inclusion criteria were: (1)
confirmed diagnosis of CF, (2) age within specified range and
(3) screening during stable clinic visit. Patients who had received
a solid organ transplant were excluded. Additionally, 3127
mothers and 975 fathers of younger children reported on their
own symptoms. Descriptive demographic and medical data are
presented in table 1.
Measures
Demographic and medical characteristics
Parents and young adults completed a Background Information
Form assessing parent and child/adolescent’s age, gender and
education. Information about pharmacological and psycho￾logical treatment of depression and anxiety was also collected.
Indicators of physical health status in the past 6 months were
recorded from medical charts (FEV1% predicted, height,
weight, haemoptysis/pneumothorax, intravenous antibiotics, and
listed for transplant).
Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale
The HADS is a 14-item instrument; seven questions measure
depression and seven measure anxiety.18 It has extensive reliabil￾ity and validity data, and was designed specifically for patients
with chronic medical conditions (i.e., removal of somatic items).
Respondents indicated the severity of each symptom on a
4-point rating scale (0–3) over the past week. Maximum score is
21; participants were categorised using established cut-off scores
(mild=8–10, moderate=11–15, severe=≥16). Validated transla￾tions were used in Europe.
Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression scale
The CES-D is a well-established self-report measure of depres￾sive symptomatology for community samples.19 It has 20 items
measuring symptoms of depression that reflect diagnostic cri￾teria on the DSM-IV and has correlated well with diagnostic
interviews. Items are rated on a 4-point scale from 0 to 3, with
higher scores indicating more depressive symptoms. The
maximum score is 60, with ≥16=elevated. Valid translations
were used in Europe.
Statistical analyses
Missing data
Missing data occurred because some countries did not collect
data on both screening measures or because participants did not
provide a response. Countries that did not collect information
on a particular measure were excluded from the analyses that
involved that measure or question. The amount of missing data
from participants who did not provide a response ranged from
0% to 7%, depending on the measure. Because few participant
responses were missing, this was unlikely to significantly bias the
results, and we opted to use complete cases in all analyses.20
Nesting of participants within country
Participants were nested within 9 countries. In analyses that
pooled data across countries, this nesting was accounted for by
including country as a fixed effect (i.e., different intercept for
each country) in the models. We chose to use a fixed effect
approach because we did not have specific hypotheses about

difference between countries, did not want to make assumptions
about countries not included in the sample and because the
limited number of countries posed challenges for alternative
approaches (e.g., multilevel modelling).21
Demographic and prevalence estimates
Prevalence estimates were based on published cut scores,18 19
and then divided into two groups according to ‘caseness’: (1)
non-case (below cut-off ) and (2) case (mild-severe symptoms).
Demographic and prevalence estimates were analysed using two
stratifications. Estimates were first stratified by a respondent to
test differences by respondent age (<18 vs. ≥18 years) and by
mothers vs. fathers. Differences between ages and respondents
on dichotomous variables were tested using a Generalised
Linear Model (GLIM) with a binomial error distribution and a
logit link function. The size of the difference between strata was
quantified using ORs comparing younger with older respon￾dents, and mothers with fathers. Similar GLIMs were used for
all analyses of dichotomous outcomes that pooled data across
countries. Differences on continuous variables were estimated
using a General Linear Model, and η2 was used to quantify the
size of the differences. Estimates were also stratified by country
to test for variability among countries. For dichotomous vari￾ables, variability across strata was tested using a χ2 test, and the
amount of variability was estimated using Cramér’s V(wc). For
continuous items, the variability was tested using a General
Linear Model, and η2 was used to quantify the amount of
variability.
Comorbidity and concordance
Theoretically, a great deal of evidence suggests that anxiety
often precedes depression,22 therefore, a GLIM was used to
assess the odds of reporting elevations in depression given
respondents’ reports of anxiety. Concordance between 1130
parent–adolescent dyads was also evaluated using a GLIM. The
model evaluated the odds that adolescents would report
symptoms above the cut-off given that their parents also
reported symptoms above the cut-off; these analyses were con￾ducted separately for depression and anxiety scores.
Predictors of depression and anxiety
To identify predictors of depression and anxiety, data were
pooled across countries and stratified by participant age (<18 vs.
≥18 years) and respondent (mother vs. father). Potential predic￾tors included the 9 variables collected on the Demographic and
Medical Characteristics form and are listed in tables 1 and 2.
Each predictor was evaluated separately using a GLIM that
accounted for country of origin.
All analyses were run using SAS V.9.3.
RESULTS
Demographics
Demographic and health information for patients and caregivers
are presented in table 1 and are reported by country in table 2.
On average, patients were in their mid-20s, about half were
female, body mass index (BMI) was in the normal range and
lung function indicated moderate disease severity. Significant
variability was found across countries on age, gender, BMI and
FEV1% predicted, however, these effects were small. Across
countries, variability was also found in the predictors of psycho￾logical distress: haemoptysis/pneumothorax (2%–32%), cur￾rently on intravenous antibiotics (5%–19%), listed for
transplant (2%–12%), and pharmacological/psychological treat￾ment of depression or anxiety (3%–23%).
Prevalence of symptoms of depression
Rates of depression varied depending on age and screening
tool: adolescents 5%–19%, adults 13%–29%, mothers 20%–
34% and fathers 18%–25% (table 1 and figure 1). Analyses by
country indicated that overall, 11% of patients were elevated on
the HADS-D (range 8%–15%) and 27% of patients were ele￾vated on the CES-D (range 20%–31%) (table 2). Because the

sample size for Turkey was small and the availability of standard
medications for CF is limited, their estimates were not included
in the ranges above (i.e., Turkey: depression on the
HADS-D=29%, CES-D=52%). Statistically significant differ￾ences were found by age (see table 1), with adolescents report￾ing fewer symptoms of depression than adults (19% vs. 29% on
the CES-D; p<0.001). Mothers reported significantly more
depressive symptoms than fathers on the CES-D (34% vs. 25%;
p<0.001), but not on the HADS-D (20% vs. 18%).
For the countries that administered both the CES-D and
HADS-D to patients, significant differences in prevalence rates
were found between measures. Comparing the CES-D with the
HADS-D, the OR for adolescents was 4.45 (p<0.001) and the
OR for adults was 2.90 (p<0.001). For mothers, the OR was
1.88 (p <0.001) and for fathers it was 1.09 (p=0.650).
Prevalence of symptoms of anxiety
Symptoms of anxiety were prevalent in patients and parents: ado￾lescents 22%, adults 32%, mothers 48% and fathers 36% (see
table 1 and figure 1). Analyses by country indicated high rates of
anxiety among patients (mean 30%), with moderate variability
across countries (14%–35%; Turkey falls within this range).
Statistically significant differences were found by age, with 22% of
adolescents vs. 32% of adults (p<0.001) reporting elevations in
anxiety above the cut-off score (see table 1, figure 1). Mothers also
reported significantly more symptoms of anxiety than fathers
(48% vs. 36%, p<0.001).
Comorbidity between depression and anxiety
In terms of both the theory22 and the higher rates of anxiety
observed across both patients and parents, bidirectional relation￾ships between anxiety and depression were examined by
calculating the odds that those with elevated anxiety would also
score in the elevated range for depression. Adolescents reporting
elevated anxiety had odds of reporting depression that were
14.97 times higher than adolescents not reporting anxiety; 6%
of adolescents reported elevations on both. Adults reporting
anxiety were 13.64 times more likely to report elevated depres￾sion than those not elevated on anxiety; 14% of adults reported
elevations on both. Mothers reporting elevated anxiety were
15.52 times more likely to report elevations in depression; 31%
reported elevations on both. For fathers with elevated anxiety,
they were 9.20 times more likely to report elevated depression;
21% reported elevations on both. All effect sizes were large.
Concordance between parent and adolescent depression
and anxiety
For the 1122 dyads with both parent and teen reports, adoles￾cents were 2.39 times more likely be above the cut-off for
depression if at least one of their parents had elevated symptoms
and they were 2.22 times more likely to be above the cut-off for
anxiety if their parent was also elevated.
Predictors of depression and anxiety
Predictors of depression and anxiety were identified using uni￾variate logistic regressions (see table 3). For adolescents, the fol￾lowing characteristics were associated with elevated symptoms
of depression on the CES-D or HADS-D: being female, an
episode of haemoptysis/pneumothorax in past 6 months, taking
psychiatric medication for depression or anxiety and receiving

For adults, depression was associated with: older age, lower
FEV1% predicted, haemoptysis or pneumothorax in the past
6 months, recently on intravenous antibiotics, listed for trans￾plant, taking psychiatric medications and receiving psychother￾apy. Characteristics associated with elevated symptoms of
anxiety were: older age, being female, lower BMI, lower FEV1,
haemoptysis/pneumothorax, listed for transplant, taking psychi￾atric medications and receiving psychotherapy.
For mothers, child characteristics associated with depression
were: recently on intravenous antibiotics and receiving psycho￾therapy. Elevated anxiety was associated with: younger age,
recent intravenous antibiotics and receiving psychotherapy. For
fathers, only one child medical variable was associated with
depression: recent intravenous antibiotics.
DISCUSSION
This is the largest psychological screening study conducted in a
chronic respiratory disease, with data collected from both
European countries and the USA. Results across nine countries
revealed high rates of depression and anxiety in adolescents and
adults with CF, as well as parent caregivers. Elevated depression
was reported by 17% of patients across countries, regardless of
which screening tool was used—a rate two times that reported
in community populations (9.2%).23 Similarly, although there
are fewer large-scale studies of caregivers, 37% of mothers and
31% of fathers reported clinically elevated depression, which is
three times the rate in community samples.23 24 Rates of anxiety
were also elevated in patients and caregivers, with 30% of
patients and 36%–48% of parents above the clinical cut-off.
These rates are two to three times those reported in community
samples.25–27
Given these high rates of psychological symptoms and their
documented effects on disease management, including clinic
attendance and adherence to prescribed treatments,7 16 28
annual screening of depression and anxiety for adolescents and
adults with CF and parent caregivers is warranted. This conclu￾sion is consistent with several international guidelines, which
recommend regular screening for adolescents and adults with
chronic conditions—particularly if these symptoms impact daily
functioning and management of the disease.29–32 For example,
the American Diabetes Association recommends screening of
psychological symptoms at ‘regular clinical encounters’ and
when there is ‘concern about poor management’.
32 To date,
however, there is no guideline recommendation for screening
parent caregivers.
As found in prior studies, comorbidity of anxious and depres￾sive symptoms within individuals was high, suggesting that ele￾vations in anxiety confer a heightened risk for depression.
Analyses of parent-adolescent dyads showed that depression or
anxiety in either parent doubled the risk that the adolescent
would report elevated psychological distress. This well￾established comorbidity between parents and adolescents pro￾vides a second rationale for screening parent caregivers.

may both prevent adolescents with CF from developing psycho￾logical symptoms, and when detected in parents, prompt the
medical team to provide referrals for mental health services to
the family.
We used two well-established screening measures of depres￾sion, and in countries that used both (i.e., 5 out of 9 countries),
comparisons indicated that the HADS-D underestimated symp￾toms of depression by a factor of two. Although when the study
protocol was being developed, the HADS was considered well
established and widely used, more recent evidence has clearly
shown that this screening tool has significant problems, including
lack of sensitivity, underestimation of symptoms and a three￾factor, rather than two-factor structure, and is not recommended
for screening.33–35 Additionally, it was chosen because it did not
contain somatic items (e.g., fatigue). A posthoc analysis of the
rank ordering of depressive symptoms on the CES-D in our
patient sample, showed that no somatic items were ranked
among the top three. In fact, the symptoms with the highest
severity ratings focused on hopefulness about the future, self￾esteem and extent of happiness. Further, a comparison of items
on the HADS-D and CES-D revealed that many of the diagnostic
criteria in the DSM-IV/V were not represented on the HADS-D
(e.g., cognitive impairment, lack of energy). Instead, the vast
majority of items on the HADS-D measured anhedonia (72%),
which represents lack of enjoyment and pleasure in activities.36
By contrast, the CES-D included items representing the full spec￾trum of depressive symptoms underlying this construct.
Several risk factors were associated with elevated depression
and anxiety. Older age and female sex, worse disease severity, as
indicated by lower lung function or BMI, and recent changes in
health status (past 6 months), such as haemoptysis or prescrip￾tion of intravenous antibiotics. Treatments for psychological dis￾tress (with medication or psychotherapy) were the highest risk
factors. For parents, recent course of intravenous antibiotics and
current treatment for a psychological disorder were associated
with greater symptomatology.
Limitations and future directions
Although the demographic and health information from the
three largest samples in this study (UK, USA and Germany)
appeared quite similar to data in their respective national regis￾tries,11 15 it is possible that this sample is not representative of
the larger international population. In screening studies, those
who are experiencing the most severe symptoms are less likely
to attend regular clinic visits or give informed consent for par￾ticipation in research, and thus, these prevalence rates may be
an underestimate of the population.37 This study was also
limited by the cross-sectional nature of the data collection.
Prospective, longitudinal studies are needed to determine:
which health variables predict increases in psychological symp￾toms and what health consequences follow identification of ele￾vated scores (e.g., decreased adherence, increases in pulmonary
exacerbations, increases in healthcare use and cost, decreases in
health-related quality of life).
These results highlight the importance of measuring and
treating mental health issues in patients and families coping
with serious, chronic illnesses. Our findings, in conjunction with
other smaller studies, have led to the formation of an inter￾national committee, sponsored by both the European Cystic
Fibrosis Society and the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, to develop
guidelines on mental health screening and treatment in CF. As
advocated by other national guidelines committees, we have
recommended annual screening of depression and anxiety in
adolescents and adults with CF, and parent caregivers using the
PHQ-9 and GAD-7.23 30–32 38 39 Our goals are to implement
these screening recommendations using the unique structure of
accredited and recognised CF centres in Europe and the USA
and to take advantage of the existing data registries in Europe,
the UK and the USA to better understand the relationships
between psychological distress and health outcomes.
