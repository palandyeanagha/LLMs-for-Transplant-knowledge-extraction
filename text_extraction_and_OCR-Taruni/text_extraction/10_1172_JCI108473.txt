A B S T R A C T Rapid hemodialysis of uremic animals
may induce a syndrome characterized by increased
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure, grand mal seizures,
and electroencephalographic abnormalities. There is a fall
in pH and bicarbonate concentration in CSF, and brain
osmolality exceeds that of plasma, resulting in a net
movement of water into the brain. This syndrome has
been called experimental dialysis disequilibrium syn￾drome. The fall in pH of CSF may be secondary to a
fall of intracellular pH (pHi) in brain. Since changes
in pHi can alter intracellular osmolality in other tissues,
it was decided to investigate brain pHi in uremia, and
the effects of hemodialysis. Brain pHi was measured
by evaluating the distribution of "4C-labeled dimethadione
in brain relative to CSF, while extracellular space was
calculated as the MSO4 space relative to CSF. In ani￾mals with acute renal failure, brain (cerebral cortex)
pHi was 7.06±0.02 (±+SE) while that in CSF was
7.31+-0.02, both values not different from normal. After
rapid hemodialysis (100 min) of uremic animals, plasma
creatinine fell from 11.8 to 5.9 mg/dl. Brain pHi was
6.89±0.02 and CSF pH was 7.19±0.02, both values sig￾nificantly lower than in uremic animals (P < 0.01), and
there was a 12% increase in brain water content. After
slow hemodialysis (210 min), brain pHi (7.01±0.02)
and pH in CSF (7.27±0.02) were both significantly
greater than values observed after rapid hemodialysis
(P < 0.01), and brain water content was normal. None
of the above maneuvers had any effect on pHi of skeletal
muscle or subcortical white matter.
The data show that rapid hemodialysis of uremic dogs
is accompanied by a significant fall in pH of CSF and

pHi is cerebral edema.
INTRODUCTION
Dialysis disequilibrium syndrome (DDS)' is a well
described complication of the treatment of renal failure
with hemodialysis (1, 2). The syndrome is most com￾mon either in patients undergoing their initial treatment
with hemodialysis or in children (3). The usual symp￾toms of DDS are headache, nausea, restlessness, and
lethargy, while seizures and coma may occur (1, 2). In
patients with DDS, the electroencephalogram usually
shows a characteristic pattern (4) and there is often a
fall in pH of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) both in man
(5, 6) and experimental animals (7). We have previ￾ously shown that when acutely uremic dogs (bilateral
ureteral ligation for 31 days) are treated with rapid
hemodialysis (blood flow = 12 ml/kg per min for 100
min), they may develop experimental DDS. In such ani￾mals, there is an osmotic gradient from brain to plasma
that results in a net movement of water into brain. The
osmole content of brain in animals treated with rapid
hemodialysis was significantly greater than that of ani￾mals treated with slow hemodialysis (blood flow = 5
ml/kg per min for 210 min), although plasma urea,
creatinine, and osmolality fell by the same amount after
either dialytic procedure (7). The increased brain
osmole content could not be entirely accounted for by
changes in brain concentration of Na+, K+, Cl-, Ca',
Mg++, or urea (7, 8).
Along with the increase in brain osmole content, a
significant fall in both pH and bicarbonate concentration

of CSF is observed in animals treated with rapid hemo￾dialysis (7). The CSF has thus undergone a net gain in
H+ ion. These H+ ions could have come from only two
places-blood or brain. Since arterial pH rose while that
of CSF fell, it is most likely that the increased H+ ion in
CSF came from the brain.
The gain of H+ ions by CSF thus suggests a possible
fall in intracellular pH (pHi) of the brain in uremic
animals treated with rapid hemodialysis. It has been
demonstrated that a fall in pHi can increase intracellu￾lar osmolality in other cell systems, particularly the red
blood cells (9). Rapid hemodialysis in some manner may
result in a decrease of brain pHi, with a resultant in￾crease of intracellular osmolality in brain. Such a se￾quence could account for many of the observed mani￾festations of experimental DDS. It is the purpose of the
present experiments to evaluate pHi of brain in uremic
animals, and the effects of both rapid and slow hemo￾dialysis.
METHODS
Studies were done in four groups of mongrel dogs of both
sexes, 18-26 kg, as follows: (a) normal animals; (b) dogs
with acute uremia of 32 days duration; (c) acutely uremic
dogs treated with rapid hemodialysis; (d) acutely uremic
dogs treated with slow hemodialysis. Groups contained
five to eight animals.
In all animals, measurements were made in CSF and
arterial blood or plasma of pH, Po2, Pco2, bicarbonate,
osmolality, urea, creatinine, and radioactivity from [4-dione￾2-4C]5,5-dimethyloxazolidine-2 ( [4C]DMO) and mSO,4.
Both isotopes are from New England Nuclear, Boston,
Mass. Lactate was measured both in CSF and in a portion
of the cerebral hemisphere rapidly (less than 5 s) frozen
in liquid nitrogen.
Acute uremia was induced by bilateral ureteral ligation
for 31 days, at which time plasma urea and creatinine were
65.8 mM and 11.8 mg/dl, respectively. Hemodialysis was
carried out with a Travenol RSP unit pediatric coil with
0.6 M2 surface area at a dialysate flow rate of 500 ml/min
(Travenol Laboratories, Artificial Organs Div., Morton
Grove, Ill.). Blood flow for rapid hemodialysis was 12 ml/
kg per min for 100 min, and for slow hemodialysis, 5 ml/kg
per min for 210 min, employing standard dialysate (Diasol,
Travenol Laboratories, Deerfield, Ill.). The techniques have
previously been described (7).
All animals were studied while under anesthesia (sodium
pentobarbital 25 mg/kg i.v.), intubated, and mechanically
ventilated while spontaneous respiration was controlled with
i.v. succinyl choline, as previously described (7, 10). After
intubation, the arterial Pco2 was adjusted to about 35 mm
Hg and animals were then given both ["C]DMO, 8 ,uCi/kg
i.v. and 0.1 gCi/kg in the cisterna magna, and Na2'SO4,
20 ,uCi/kg i.v. and 2.5 /ACi/kg into the cisterna magna. The
techniques have previously been described (10). The ['C]-
DMO was dissolved in 0.4 M "cold" DMO at a concentra￾tion of 25 ,gCi/ml, while the Na23SO4 was in 100 mM
"cold" Na2SO4 at a concentration of 50 /ACi/ml. The pHi and
extracellular space were determined in muscle, gray matter,
and white matter by evaluating the distribution of both DMO
and :'SO4= relative to either cortical CSF or plasma; the
complete analytical method has been described (10). Briefly,
after injecting the isotopes as described above, a 3-h equili￾bration period was allowed. At the conclusion of the experi￾ment, samples were obtained of both cisternal and cortical
CSF, arterial blood, skeletal muscle, brain subcortical white
matter, brain cortical gray matter, and cerebral hemisphere,
as previously described (7). Triplicate samples, each about

0.5 M perchloric acid as previously described (11). Dupli￾cate aliquots of supernate, plasma, and cortical CSF were
treated with BaCl2 to precipitate 'SO,4= but retain 14C. All
samples were counted as previously described (11, 12). Sub￾tracting 14C activity from the total radioactivity gave the

activity per gram tissue to radioactivity per gram CSF. The
intracellular pH was calculated by the distribution of [14C]-
DMO in tissue relative to cortical CSF (for gray matter)
or plasma H20 (for white matter or muscle). The formula
was modified from that described by Kibler et al. (13), with
pH of cisternal CSF for gray matter and arterial pH for
muscle and white matter. The bicarbonate concentration in
cerebral cortex was calculated from values for cerebral
cortex pHi and Pco2 of CSF, as described by Kjallquist
et al. (14). Measurements of urea, creatinine, osmolality,
pH, Po2, bicarbonate, and Pco2 were made in CSF and
arterial blood by previously described methods (7, 10), and
lactate was measured in CSF and brain (10).
RESULTS
The normal values for CSF and arterial blood pH, P02,
Pco2, bicarbonate, and lactate are shown in Table I,
while control values for pHi of muscle, gray matter, and
white matter are in Table II. In the acutely uremic dogs,
plasma osmolality (±SE) was 347±6 mosmol/kg, while
plasma urea and creatinine were 65.8±0.4 mM and 11.8±
0.4 mg/dl, respectively. In animals with acute renal fail￾ure, despite a fall in arterial pH from 7.36 to 7.22, there
was no change in the pHi of either brain or muscle
(Fig. 1). Both the pH and bicarbonate in CSF were
normal (Table I), despite the significant fall in plasma
bicarbonate concentration.
Dogs were then treated with either rapid or slow he￾modialysis. After rapid hemodialysis, plasma urea and
creatinine fell to 24.4±2.4 mM and 6.4+0.5 mg/dl, re￾spectively, There was no change in the pHi of skeletal
muscle. However, there was a highly significant fall
(P <0.001) in the pHi of brain (Fig. 2). The pHi in

cerebral cortex was 6.89±0.02 (±-SE), versus 7.06+
0.02 (P < 0.01) observed in uremic animals. There was
a fall in cerebral cortex bicarbonate to 8.0±0.5 mmol/kg
H20 (normal value, 11.3+0.4 mmol/kg H20) but no
change in brain lactate (Table II). Accompanying the
fall in gray matter pHi was a significant (P < 0.01) fall
in pH of CSF (Fig. 3), from 7.33+0.02 before dialysis
to 7.19±0.02 after(P <0.001), while CSF bicarbonate
fell from 18.9±1.1 mmol/liter to 15.4+0.5 mmol/liter
(P < 0.001), and lactate in CSF was unaltered (Table
I). In addition to the fall in cerebral cortex pHi, there
was also cerebral edema, as defined by an increase in
brain water content from 397±7 to 442±+15 g/100 g dry
wt (P < 0.01) in cerebral cortex and 211±6 to 237±9
g/lOO g dry wt in white matter (P < 0.01).
After dogs were treated with slow hemodialysis for
210 min, plasma urea and creatinine fell by an amount
similar to that after rapid hemodialysis. The cerebral
cortex pHi fell slightly to 7.01+0.02, not different from
normal (P > 0.09), but significantly greater (P < 0.003)
than the brain pHi observed after rapid hemodialysis
(Fig. 2). Both the bicarbonate and pH of CSF in dogs
treated with slow hemodialysis (18.2+0.4 mmol/liter and
7.27±0.02) were significantly different from values ob￾served after rapid hemodialysis (P < 0.01). Animals
treated with slow hemodialysis did not develop brain
edema (Table II). The pHi in brain white matter did
not change after either rapid or slow hemodialysis
(Table II).

ion is accompanied by an increase in brain osmole con￾tent (7), leading to an increase in brain water content.
Brain H+ ion is increased by a significantly lesser in￾crement when uremic animals are treated with slow he￾modialysis. The source of the increased brain H+ ion is
not known, but it is probably not due to hypoxia, de￾creased cerebral blood flow, or increased cerebral lac￾tate production. Cerebral hypoxia is unlikely, as the Po2
in CSF was normal and Po2 of CSF is similar to that of
brain (15, 16). Furthermore, cerebral hypoxia should
lead to increased brain lactate, and such a phenomenon
did not occur (Table II). Similarly, decreased cerebral
blood flow probably did not occur, as such a circumstance
should lead to a fall in Po2 of CSF, and an increase in
brain and CSF lactate (15). In animals treated with
rapid hemodialysis, brain and CSF lactate were normal
(Tables I and II). Although the exact biochemical se￾quence leading to an increase in brain H+ ion is not
known, rapid hemodialysis of uremic animals may lead
to an increase in brain organic acid(s). In both mammals
(17, 18) and amphibians (19) in whom abrupt increases
in extracellular osmolality are induced, brain content of
amino acids increases. In primates subj ected to re￾versible asphyxia, there is an increase in brain glutamic
acid, probably a result of increased conversion from
glutamine (20). The presence in brain of strong organic
acid(s) would tend to increase osmolality by at least two
mechanisms: (a) displacement of intracellularly bound
K+ ion from protein anions by H+ ions, as in the hemo￾globin molecule (9, 20); the K+ ion, osmotically inactive
when bound to intracellular protein, may become os￾motically active when displaced by a H+ ion. (b) Produc￾tion of increased quantities of organic acids, per se, could
raise brain osmolality.

The water content increased in both gray and white
matter of the brain (Table II), although pHi fell only in
gray matter. Why pHi did not fall in white matter is
not entirely clear, but may be related to the different
structural characteristics of the two tissues. White mat￾ter consists largely of myelin and fibers, containing little
cellular material, while gray matter is largely cellular.
The method used to evaluate pHi (10) may not be suffi￾ciently sensitive when only a small portion of the tissue
actually consists of cells. The actual increase in white
matter water content was less than that observed in gray
matter (Table II).
In patients with metabolic acidosis from various
causes, it has been shown that when arterial pH is
rapidly corrected by infusion of NaHCO3, a paradoxical
acidosis may develop in the CSF (16). The fall in pH
of CSF is essentially all due to a rise in Pco2 of CSF,
secondary to hypoventilation induced by rapid elevation
of arterial pH and bicarbonate. In patients with subacute
metabolic acidosis, both pH and Pco2 tend to be abnor￾mally low in CSF. Because of the blood-brain barrier,
when plasma bicarbonate is elevated with intravenously
administered NaHCO3, plasma and CSF bicarbonate
levels will not equilibrate for several hours, while Pcoa
equilibrates within minutes (21, 22). Thus, when hypo￾ventilation results in a rise of arterial Pco2, the pH in
CSF will fall as C02 rapidly diffuses into the CSF
(21-23).
In 18 patients with diabetic ketoacidosis in whom pH
of CSF was evaluated during therapy (22-24), pH of
CSF fell from 7.30 to 7.20 while arterial pH rose from
7.08 to 7.34. However, the fall in pH of CSF was en￾tirely due to a rise in CSF PcO2 (from 24 to 34 mm Hg),
as bicarbonate in CSF actually rose slightly (from 10.9
to 12.1 mmol/liter).
The situation during hemodialysis is quite different.
Arterial pH is rapidly elevated as a consequence of in￾travenous administration (through the dialysis mem￾brane) of bicarbonate precursor (lactate or acetate).
However, studies of acid-base status in uremic patients
treated with dialysis suggest that despite rapid elevation
of arterial pH and bicarbonate, hypoventilation is not
generally observed (25). In animal studies reported here
and elsewhere (7), pH of CSF fell during hemodialysis
although arterial Pco2 was maintained at a constant
level (Table I).
However, the fall in pH of CSF was primarily due to a
fall in CSF bicarbonate (Table I), implying the de novo
presence of organic acids. Thus, the production of para￾doxical CSF acidosis after rapid hemodialysis is not
related to systemic hypoventilation and is a different
mechanism from that observed after treatment of other
forms of metabolic acidosis (22-24, 26, 27).
Whatever the mechanisms, rapid hemodialysis of ure￾mic animals results in a fall in pH of CSF and cerebral
cortex pHi, associated with increased brain osmole con￾tent and cerebral edema. There is a concomitant fall in
pH and bicarbonate concentration of CSF, but no change
in skeletal muscle pHi, while pH and bicarbonate of ar￾terial blood rise. This phenomenon appears to be a major
mechanism in the pathogenesis of DDS in experimental
animals.
