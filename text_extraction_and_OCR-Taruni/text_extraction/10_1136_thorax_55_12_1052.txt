Abstract
BACKGROUND Lymphangioleiomyomatosis is a rare lung disease
that affects only women. No controlled trials of management have


been performed and, until such data are available, management
must be based on clinical experience. This study provides data on
the natural history of lymphangioleiomyomatosis in the UK and
compares this with experience from other centres.
METHODS We tried to identify all cases of
lymphangioleiomyomatosis in the UK over a five year period by
contacting all chest physicians. Cases were confirmed by lung
biopsy or history and high resolution computed tomographic (CT)
scanning. Details of disease and management were obtained from
hospital notes.
RESULTS The 50 patients who fitted the diagnostic criteria for
lymphangioleiomyomatosis had a median age at onset of 35 years
(range 22–50). Five presented when postmenopausal (four taking
hormone replacement therapy). Pneumothorax and dyspnoea were
the most common presenting features. Extrapulmonary
presentations included renal angiomyolipomas (3) and
lymphangiomyomas (2). Only half the patients were assessed for
renal angiomyolipoma and six were identified. Thirty patients had
had one or more pneumothoraces, of which two thirds recurred if
treated conservatively. Chylous effusions occurred in 11 patients,
five requiring surgery. Pregnancy was uncommon once the
diagnosis was made (n=7), but was associated with an increase in
complications. Half the patients were taking a β agonist and many
showed a bronchodilator response in the laboratory. Thirty six
patients had received hormone treatment.
CONCLUSIONS Our UK five year period prevalence was one per 1.1
million population. Since prophylactic interventions are sometimes
indicated for renal angiomyolipoma, these data suggest that
screening for angiomyolipoma, ideally by CT scanning, may be
underused. Patients need to be aware of the increase in
complications associated with pregnancy. Recurrence rate of
pneumothorax was high in those not treated surgically. Hormone
treatment was used variably and controlled trials are needed to
determine their role and the optimum duration and dose.
