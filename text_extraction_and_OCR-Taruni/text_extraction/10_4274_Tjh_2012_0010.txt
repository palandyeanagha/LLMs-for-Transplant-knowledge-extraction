Abstract:
Three cases of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-negative post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease that occurred 6 to 8 years after 
renal transplantation are reported. The patients respectively had gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma, gastric 
diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, and atypical Burkitt lymphoma. Absence of EBV in the tissue samples was demonstrated by both 
in situ hybridization for EBV early RNA and polymerase chain reaction for EBV DNA. Patients were treated with reduction in 
immunosuppression and combined chemotherapy plus an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, rituximab. Despite the reduction 
in immunosuppression, patients had stable renal functions without loss of graft functions. The patient with atypical Burkitt 
lymphoma had an abnormal karyotype, did not respond to treatment completely, and died due to disease progression. The other 
patients are still alive and in remission 5 and 3 years after diagnosis, respectively. EBV-negative post-transplant lymphoproliferative 
diseases are usually late-onset and are reported to have poor prognosis. Thus, reduction in immunosuppression is usually not 
sufficient for treatment and more aggressive approaches like rituximab with combined chemotherapy are required.

Özet:
Böbrek naklinden 6-8 yıl sonra Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) negatif posttransplant lenfoproliferatif hastalık geliştiren 3 olgu rapor 
edilmektedir. Hastaların tanıları gastrik MALT lenfoma, gastrik diffüz büyük B hücreli lenfoma ve atipik-burkitt lenfoma idi. 
Hem EBV early RNA için yapılan in-situ hibridizasyon yöntemi hem de EBV DNA için yapılan polimeraz zincir reaksiyonu 
ile doku örneklerinde EBV saptanamamıştır. Hastalara immünsupresyonun azaltılması ile birlikte rituksimab içeren kombine 
kemoterapi protokolleri verilmiştir. İmmünsupresyonun azaltılmasına rağmen böbrek fonksiyonlarında önemli bir kayıp 
gözlenmemiştir. Anormal karyotipe sahip atipik Burkitt lenfomalı hasta tedaviye rağmen hastalık ilerlemesi ile erken dönemde 
kaybedilmiştir. Diğer hastalar hala remisyonda takip edilmektedir. EBV negatif posttransplant lenfoproliferatif hastalıkların 
genellikle geç başlangıçlı ve kötü prognozlu olduğu bilinmektedir. Bu hastalarda immünsupresyonun azaltılması tek başına 
yeterli bir tedavi olmadığı gibi rituksimab içeren kombine kemoterapilerle daha agresif tedaviler gerekli olmaktadır.

Introduction
Post-transplant lymphoproliferative diseases (PTLDs) 
are a heterogeneous group of diseases that develop as 
early or late-onset disease in solid organ or bone marrow 
transplant recipients with an incidence ranging between 
1% and 20% [1,2]. It is reported that in renal transplant 
recipients PTLD is the second most common malignancy 
after skin cancer [3,4,5]. Pathogenesis of PTLD is not 
well understood. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection and 
prolonged immunosuppression (IS) are the 2 major factors 
in pathogenesis. Inhibition of cytotoxic T-cell functions 
due to IS removes the control over EBV-infected B cells, 
which results in expansion of B cells, acquisition of genetic 
mutations, and clonal proliferation [6,7]. The highest risk of 
developing PTLD is within the first year after transplantation. 
EBV is found to be positive in 60%-80% of PTLDs and is 
usually associated with early-onset PTLD. However, EBV￾negative PTLD is mainly late-onset [8,9,10,11,12]. 
Three patients who had received renal transplantation at 
other centers were admitted to our department, where they 
received the diagnosis of PTLD and were further followed. 
The presence of EBV could not be demonstrated in any of 
the samples by in situ hybridization for EBV early RNA or 
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of EBV DNA. 
Informed consent was obtained.
Case Reports
Case 1
A 28-year-old female patient was diagnosed with 
Helicobacter pylori (HP)-positive gastric mucosa-associated 
lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma (stage IE) 6 years 
after receiving renal transplantation from her mother. 
She had been on mycophenolate mofetil, tacrolimus, and 
prednisolone for the last 3 years. After the diagnosis of 
lymphoma, the immunosuppressive therapy was modified 
with cessation of mycophenolate mofetil and dose reduction 
of tacrolimus. The patient received HP eradication therapy 
and was followed with endoscopic biopsies every 3 months. 
The HP infection was persistent and all biopsies supported 
the presence of a MALT lymphoma histologically. One 
year after the diagnosis, IgH chain clonality analysis by 
nested PCR revealed 2 separate clones on the polyclonal 
background, which was consistent with oligoclonal 
proliferation. The follow-up endoscopy revealed a larger 
ulcer and the pathology revealed MALT lymphoma 
invading the muscularis mucosa (Figure 1). The patient 
responded to combined chemotherapy with rituximab, 
cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and methyl prednisolone 
(R-CVP). Five years after diagnosis, she is being followed 
in complete remission. She is on prednisolone at 5 mg/day 
per os and tacrolimus at 2 mg/day per os, and her renal 
functions are stable with serum creatinine levels in the 
range of 1.3-1.6 mg/dL. 
Case 2
A 31-year-old male patient presented with anemia due to 
chronic blood loss from the gastrointestinal tract. Endoscopic 
examination revealed a large ulcerated mass of the stomach. A 
computerized tomography (CT) scan demonstrated an 8.5x4 
cm mass extending outside the stomach wall, suggesting an 
aggressive lymphoma, but endoscopic biopsy revealed MALT 
lymphoma with lambda monoclonal atypical B cell infiltration. 
The patient had received renal transplantation 7 years before 
diagnosis and had been on immunosuppressive therapy with 
cyclosporine A, azathioprine, and prednisolone since then. 
After the diagnosis of stage IE PTLD, IS drugs were tapered 
and stopped. Anti-HP treatment and 6 cycles of combined 
chemotherapy with R-CVP were administered. Prednisolone 
at 5 mg/day was resumed due to the deterioration of his renal 
functions. A CT scan of the abdomen revealed thickening 
of the stomach wall and perigastric lymphadenopathy. The 
endoscopy demonstrated the persistence of the giant ulcer 
in the stomach, with the biopsy revealing diffuse large B-cell 
lymphoma (DLBCL) (Figure 2). He was treated with total 
gastrectomy followed by combined chemotherapy with 
rituximab, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and 
methyl prednisolone, and he is in complete remission 3 years 
after diagnosis. His serum creatinine levels are in the range of 
1.5-2.0 mg/dL with prednisolone at 5 mg/day every other day. 
Case 3
A 28-year-old male patient was admitted to the hospital 
with ptosis of the left eyelid, diplopia, and extreme sweating 
for the last few weeks. He had received a renal allograft 
from a living donor 8 years before. The immunosuppressive 
regimen consisted of azathiopurine, cyclosporine A, and 
prednisolone. His complete blood count revealed a white 
blood cell count of 11.3x109/L, hemoglobin of 15.3 g/dL, and 
platelet count of 49x109/L. On the peripheral blood smear, 
60% of the leukocytes were atypical lymphoid cells with 
Figure 1. MALT lymphoma. Small monocytoid lymphocytes 
and some plasma cells in the lamina propria of the gastric 
mucosa (1a, 1b, 1c). These cells were diffusely positive for 
CD20 and CD79a, forming a lymphoepithelial lesion. Kappa 
light chain restriction was demonstrated on neoplastic cells. 
Bcl10 was negative by immunohistochemistry.

cytoplasmic vacuoles. Bone marrow examination revealed 
the diagnosis of atypical Burkitt lymphoma (aBL) (Figure 
3). Flow cytometric analysis revealed that the immature cells 
were positive for HLA-DR and the B cell antigens CD19, 
CD10, cytoplasmic CD22 (+/-), surface CD22, FMC7, 
CD52, cytoplasmic CD79a, and surface IgM (+/-), and were 
negative for T-cell antigen CD5. The patient had a complex 
karyotype consisting of clonal trisomy X, add1 (q25), t(3;6) 
(q23;q23), trisomy 7, t(8;14) (q22;q32), der (10), der 
(11), der (16), trisomy 18, trisomy 20, and monosomy 22. 
Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis revealed positive 
results for t(8;14), trisomy 7, and MLL gene amplification. 
Cerebrospinal fluid examination was negative for malignanT￾cells but the magnetic resonance imaging of the brain 
showed disease infiltration at multiple sites. The patient 
was treated with discontinuation of the immunosuppressive 
drugs and with combined chemotherapy that contained 
rituximab, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, dexamethasone, 
and L-asparaginase. Central nervous system disease was 
treated with 6 courses of intrathecal chemotherapy followed 
by cranial irradiation. His renal functions remained within 
normal ranges. There was a dramatic clinical response after 
cessation of IS and initiation of the chemotherapy, and the 
follow-up bone marrow biopsy after chemotherapy did 
not reveal any atypical cells. However, several weeks after 
discharge, he died of disease progression in the central 
nervous system and medullary relapse.
Discussion
Three patients with PTLD demonstrating distinct 
pathologies as well as distinct clinical properties are 
reported. In all patients, the PTLD occurred long after renal 
transplantation, and all were EBV-negative. Post-transplant 
lymphoproliferative diseases may occur as early-onset (≤1 
year) or late-onset (>1 year) disease after transplantation 
[9]. Studies comparing EBV-positive and EBV-negative 
PTLD patients have demonstrated that EBV-negative PTLD 
occurred later than EBV-positive PTLD [9,10,14,15,16]. The 
rarity and the heterogeneity of the disease have prevented 
large randomized studies to compare the overall survival and 
treatment outcomes. While some of the studies have shown 
significantly decreased survival of EBV-negative patients, 
others could not demonstrate a survival difference [3,9,10,15]. 
Leblond et al. reported that median survival of EBV-negative 
patients was significantly shorter than that of EBV-positive 
patients (1 month vs. 37 months) and identified EBV negativity 
as an adverse prognostic indicator [9]. On the other hand, Tsai 
et al. could not demonstrate any significant difference between 
EBV-positive and EBV-negative PTLD patients both in terms 
of response to reduction in IS and estimated 1-year overall 
survival (68% vs. 60% for EBV-positive and EBV-negative 
groups, respectively) [3]. In accordance with these reports, 
our cases also had different outcomes: patients 1 and 2 are still 
alive without disease, while patient 3 had incomplete response 
to therapy and poor survival. 
Post-transplant lymphoproliferative diseases are very 
heterogeneous, ranging from early lesions like infectious 
mononucleosis-like disease to monoclonal monomorphic 
diseases like malignant lymphomas. The most common 
type of monomorphic PTLD is DLBCL [14,15]. On the 
other hand, MALT lymphoma and atypical or Burkitt-like 
lymphoma are very rarely observed as PTLD [12,13,14]. 
Immunohistochemical studies demonstrate that PTLD 
lesions presenting as DLBCL usually express a late germinal 
center (CD10+/-/bcl-6+/MUM-1-/CD138-) or early post￾germinal center (CD10-/bcl-6+\-/MUM-1+/CD138+) profile, 
but the germinal center profile is more commonly expressed 
in EBV-negative cases. This may suggest that EBV-negative 
PTLDs actually resemble the lymphomas that develop in 
immunocompetent hosts [7,17]. 
 Burkitt lymphoma (BL) or aBL patients typically present 
with advanced-stage disease and high tumor burden with 
generalized lymphadenopathy and frequent bone marrow 
involvement. Typical BL usually has c-myc rearrangement 
Bakanay MŞ et al: Post-Transplant Lymphproliferative Disease
Figure 3. Atypical Burkitt lymphoma. Atypical cells 
infiltrating the bone marrow had large cytoplasmic vacuoles 
consistent with L3 morphology (3a, 3b, 3c). The cells were 
positively stained with CD20, CD79a, and Bcl-6, and were 
negative for MUM-1 and Bcl-2. The proliferation index 
examined by Ki-67 was around 100%.
Figure 2. Diffuse large B cell lymphoma diffusely infiltrating 
the stomach wall. There were also cells that had anaplastic 
features (2a, 2b). The tumor cells were positive for CD20, 
were partially positive for MUM-1 and Bcl-6, and had a high 
proliferation index of around 60% with Ki-67.

as a sole abnormality. Complex chromosomal abnormalities 
in addition to c-myc are reported in patients with aggressive 
B-cell lymphoma with features intermediate between DLBCL 
and BL, which is also referred to as aBL. In accordance with 
the literature, patient 3 had very aggressive disease and did 
not respond to the therapy well [18,19,20,21].
Helicobacter pylori can be demonstrated in the gastric 
mucosa in a majority of MALT lymphomas, and HP 
eradication with antibiotics usually results in complete 
regression. It is not clear whether the risk of MALT 
lymphoma is increased due to immunosuppression after 
solid organ transplantation or if it is completely due to HP 
infection, or both. Similar to case 1, the reported cases in the 
literature were all negative for EBV and positive for HP, and 
most developed as late-onset PTLD. They were clinically and 
histologically identical to conventional MALT lymphomas, 
which occur in immunocompetent patients [22,23]. 
Although most post-transplant MALT lymphomas are 
clinically indolent and do not require aggressive treatment, 
it is not known whether anti-HP therapy alone is sufficient 
to treat the post-transplant gastric lymphomas. Nelson et 
al., in their series of PTLD, reported that a single gastric 
PTLD that could represent a high-grade MALT lymphoma 
responded to only reduction in IS [11]. However, our patient 
did not sufficiently respond to reduction in IS and anti-HP 
therapy and eventually required combined chemotherapy.
 Reduction in IS should be the first line of approach in 
treatment of PTLD [3]. In the case of kidney transplantation, 
it is recommended that immunosuppressive therapy should 
be reduced to a minimum dosage and even ceased as long as 
the graft rejection is compatible with life. Early lesions and 
polymorphic PTLD have favorable response to reduction 
in IS alone, but the monoclonal/monomorphic forms 
require more aggressive treatment. During the last decade, 
anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, rituximab, has become 
increasingly used in the treatment of CD20+ PTLD with 
better response rates of up to 60%-70%. Patients who do 
not respond to reduction in IS and rituximab can be given 
combined chemotherapy. However, combined chemotherapy 
with rituximab should be considered as first-line therapy for 
patients who are not suitable for reduction in IS or who have 
EBV-negative, late-onset aggressive disease, or for patients 
who have high tumor burden requiring an upfront rapid 
intervention [24,25,26,27,28]. In conclusion, EBV-negative 
PTLDs can be considered as a distinct group of PTLD 
resembling lymphomas of immunocompetent subjects due 
to late occurrence, higher proportion of monomorphic 
cases, and clinically more aggressive behavior.
