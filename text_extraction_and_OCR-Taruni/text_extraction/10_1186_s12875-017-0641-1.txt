Abstract
Background: Depression is more prevalent in patients with heart failure (HF) than in those without, but its
detection is complicated by the symptom overlap between the two diseases. General practitioners (GPs) are the
first point of contact for patients with HF. Therefore, this study aims to investigate GPs’ awareness of depression in
their HF patients and factors associated with this awareness.
Methods: In this cross-sectional, observational study 3224 primary care patients with HF were screened for
depressive symptomatology using an algorithm based on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the 9-item
subscale on Depression of the Patient Health Questionnaire, and selected items from the PROMIS Depression and
Anxiety scales. The 272 GPs of all patients involved in the study were interviewed by telephone regarding their
patients’ somatic and psychological comorbidities. The awareness rates of depressive symptomatology by the
patients’ GPs are analyzed using descriptive statistics. Logistic regression analyses are applied to investigate the
patient- and GP-based factors associated with the GPs’ awareness of depressive symptomatology.
Results: GPs were aware of their patients’ depressive symptomatology in 35% of all cases. Factors associated with
the awareness of depressive symptomatology were: higher patient education levels, a history of depression known
to the GP, GP-consultations due to emotional distress within the last 6 months, a higher frequency of GP-contacts
within the last 6 months, a higher New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification and more severe depressive
symptomatology. The GPs’ characteristics, including further education in psychology/psychiatry, were not associated
with GP awareness.

Conclusions: Many aspects, including the definition of awareness and the practical issues in primary care, may
contribute to the unexpectedly low awareness rates of depressive symptomatology in HF patients in primary care.
Awareness rates might increase, if GPs encouraged their patients to talk about emotional distress, held detailed medical
interviews including a patient’s history of depression and payed special attention to HF patients with low education
levels. However, it remains to be investigated whether GPs’ judgement of depressive symptomatology is a better or
worse indicator for the future prognosis and quality of life of HF patients than psychiatry based diagnostic criteria.

Background
Chronic heart failure (HF) is a disease with high rates of
mortality and hospital admissions [1, 2]. In 2013 61.7
million people suffered from HF worldwide, 55% of
those at a severe stage [3]. Depression is more prevalent
in HF patients than in those without HF, probably
because severe HF symptoms can affect a person’s func￾tional status, trigger anxiety and depression [4, 5], and,
thus, impair a patient’s health-related quality of life [6–8].
At the same time depression reduces a patient’s ability to
cope with physical symptoms and adhere to medical treat￾ment [9] which in turn leads to poorer outcomes in HF
treatment, including higher rates of mortality and hospital
admissions [10]. The detection of depression is especially
complicated in patients with HF due to the symptom￾overlap between HF and depression (e.g. fatigue, lis￾tlessness, and sleep disturbance). Because the symptom
overlap exacerbates detecting depression, national and
international HF guidelines recommend the regular and
systematic assessment of depression during the diagnostic
process and treatment of HF [11–15]. However, there is
no current evidence demonstrating the benefits of depres￾sion screening in chronic diseases [16].
If patients with depression seek medical treatment,
most consult a primary care physician (GP) [17]. A posi￾tive screening for depression in primary care has shown
that HF patients have a considerably higher likelihood of
receiving mental health treatment [9], hence GPs play a
key role in detecting potential depressions. In an inter￾national review, 47.3% of diagnosed depressions in all
primary care patients were correctly identified, while the
diagnostic sensitivity varied greatly between 6.6 and
78.8% [18]. Only two studies investigated the recognition
of depression and the factors associated with (non-) recog￾nition of depression in HF patients. Both studies recruited
inpatients, therefore, the results are not applicable to
primary care patients with HF [9, 19].
We aimed to investigate (1) to what extent the GPs were
aware of their HF patients’ depressive symptomatology
and (2) which factors were associated with this GPs’
awareness. We hypothesized, that awareness rates were
comparably or slightly lower in primary care patients with
HF when compared to all primary care patients. We
further hypothesized that GPs’ awareness rates of depres￾sive symptomatology would be associated with both
patient-based and GP-based factors.
Methods
In this cross-sectional, observational study we recruited
primary care patients with HF in Germany between 2/
2012 and 6/2014. Data was collected between 8/2012
and 11/2014. A detailed description of all study proce￾dures is described in the study protocol [20].
Recruitment
The recruitment was conducted by the two study
centers Hamburg (northern Germany) and Würzburg
(southern Germany). All GPs in four German cities
(south: Würzburg; north: Hamburg, Lübeck, Kiel) and
surrounding areas received a written invitation to par￾ticipate in the study and were contacted by phone, if
they did not respond to the letter. Of the 4420 GPs
invited, 293 were willing to participate (response rate
6.6%). The participating GPs sent written invitations
to all HF patients in their practice inviting them to
join in the study. Patient inclusion criteria were: an
age of 18 years and over, a diagnosis of chronic HF
documented within the last 5 years, and at least one
GP contact within the last 6 months. Exclusion cri￾teria were: dementia, death since the last GP-visit and
HF patients who were not regular patients of the par￾ticipating GP practice. Those patients who agreed to
participate returned the informed, written letters of
consent to the study center and in turn received a
baseline questionnaire by mail. Of 13,830 patients in￾vited to participate in the study by their GPs, 5385
(38.9%) consented to participate and 4909 (35.5%)
sent back a baseline questionnaire (see Fig. 1).
Patient questionnaire
The patient questionnaire included sociodemographic
data (age, gender, education level according to the Com￾parative Analysis of Social Mobility in Industrial Nations
(CASMIN criteria) [21], living arrangements, employ￾ment status, and type of health insurance), as well as
questions regarding the frequency of GP contacts as well
Eisele et al. BMC Family Practice (2017) 18:71 Page 2 of 11

as if there were any GP-consultations due to emotional
distress within the last 6 months. The patients were
asked to disclose current medications being taken to
treat depression, anxiety, agitation, sleep disturbance or
“burnout”. The Enhancing Recovery in Coronary Heart
Disease [ENRICHD] Social Support Instrument (ESSI)
[22] was used to assess patients’ emotional support. The
following instruments were included to screen for psy￾chosocial comorbidity: the Hospital Anxiety and Depres￾sion Scale (HADS) [23, 24], the 9-item subscale for
Depression in the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9)
[25–27], as well as selected items from the Patient￾Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System
(PROMIS) Depression and Anxiety (PROMIS-D and
PROMIS-A) scales [28, 29].
Substudy to identify a case-finding algorithm
Due to the symptom overlap between depression and
HF, a substudy was performed to establish and valid￾ate an algorithm to identify patients with depression,
Legend: GP = general practitioner 
Fig. 1 Sampling frame

adjustment disorders and anxiety disorders, which is
not biased by the overlapping symptoms between
these disorders and HF. The aim was to identify ap￾propriate cut-off values and combinations of established,
self-rating scales to find depression and anxiety in primary
care patients with HF [30]. The substudy was performed
by a cooperating study center and included HF patients
from an existing cohort not included in the main study. A
total of 194 patients with HF completed the following
questionnaires to screen for psychosocial comorbidity:
HADS, PHQ-9, PROMIS-D and PROMIS-A. They add￾itionally underwent the Structured Clinical Interview for
the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,
fourth edition (SCID) [31]. The SCID is a structured, one￾hour, face-to-face diagnostic interview between a trained
interviewer and a patient. It was considered the gold
standard for the diagnosis of disorders of the following
categories: Affective disorders, anxiety disorders and ad￾justment disorders. Receiver operating characteristic
(ROC) analyses were calculated and cut-off values were
defined according to the Youden-Index, the positive pre￾dictive values (PPV) and the negative predictive values
(NPV). The case finding properties have been published
along with the sub-study [30]: PHQ-9 cut-off 8.5, Youden’s
index 0.81; HADS-A cut-off 5.5, Youden’s index 0.53;
HADS-D cut-off 8.5, Youden’s index 0.72). The Youden’s
index for PROMIS 18.5 was 0.67 for any psychological
disorder and 0.59 for anxiety disorder. Based on the
case finding information, the following hierarchical
algorithm was generated (see Fig. 2): Criterion 1
(PHQ ≤ 8 and HADS-A ≤ 5) - no psychological dis￾order (NPV = 95.6%); Criterion 2 (PHQ > 8 and
HADS-D > 8) – depression/adjustment disorder likely
(PPV = 68.8%); Criterion 3 (Criterion 1 and 2 do not
apply and PROMIS Anxiety >18) – psychological dis￾order possible (PPV = 42.9%) [alternatively: anxiety dis￾order possible (PPV 28.6%)]; Criterion 4 (Criterion 1
and 2 do not apply and PROMIS Anxiety ≤18) – no
psychological disorder likely (NPV = 88,2%).
Definition of depressive symptomatology in the main study
In the main study described in this article, the algorithm
was applied to all baseline questionnaires as soon as they
arrived at the study center. All patients with a valid criter￾ion 2 (depression/adjustment disorder likely) were defined
as suffering from depressive symptomatology P(+). All
patients with a valid criterion 3 (psychological disorder
possible) remained in the study and were assigned as
patients without depressive symptomatology P(−) (see
Fig. 2). All patients with a valid criteria 1 (no psychological
disorder) or 4 (no psychological disorder likely) served as
a pool for the random selection of the patients without
psychosocial comorbidity. Of the patients without psycho￾social comorbidities (valid criteria 1 or 4), 80% were
randomly selected to remain in the study as P(−) patients.
Even though the algorithm to select P(+) patients was
established to identify patients with depression, the PPV
of 68.8% does not allow an immediate diagnosis of a de￾pressive disorder. Not only were patients with diagnosable
depression selected, but also patients with relevant symp￾toms of depression (not completely fulfilling the diagnos￾tic criteria for depression). Therefore, P(+) patients are
defined as patients with a diagnosable depression or de￾pressive symptoms and will be referred to as “patients
with depressive symptomatology.” In the next step the GP
of each patient, who remained in the study after random
selection, was interviewed.

GP telephone interview
The telephone interview with the patients’ GPs was sched￾uled for three weeks after the baseline questionnaire was
sent out to the patients. The interview started with ques￾tions regarding the GP’s sociodemographic data and speci￾fications, as well as practice details. In the second part, the
GPs were interviewed regarding the comorbidities of each
patient. This included asking the GP about a valid HF
diagnosis, the New York Heart Association Functional
Classification (NYHA class) and comorbidities of the
Charlson Index [32], followed by the question: “Does the
patient currently display a depressive symptomatology?” If
this question was answered with “yes,” the GP was asked
whether he or she judges the symptoms as a clinical de￾pression or as sub-threshold symptoms and what mea￾sures he or she had taken thus far to treat said symptoms.
Then the GP was asked to name the Codes of the Inter￾national Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related
Health Problems (10th version) (ICD-Codes) [33] of all
further chronic and acute diseases the patient had at the
time of the interview. In the next step, all conditions of
the Charlson Index were transformed into three-digit￾ICD-Codes. The three-digit-ICD-Codes of both sources
(Charlson Index and the ICD-Codes stated by the GP)
were grouped into 42 comorbidity groups based on the
MultiCare list of chronic conditions [34]. Four of the Multi￾Care conditions were excluded as they presented inclusion
or exclusion criteria for this study (“Dementia” was an
exclusion criterion in this study, “Cardiac insufficiency” was
a required criterion (all patients had a diagnosis of HF), and
“Depression” as well as “Anxiety” were directly measured
by the patient questionnaire). The number of comorbidities
according to the MultiCare list of chronic conditions was
summed up to create the comorbidity score.
Analysis of awareness rates and associated factors
The patients were grouped for analysis according to the
information from the patient questionnaires (P[+] or P[−])
and the GP interviews (see Table 1 and Figs. 1 and 2).
Based on all patients with depressive symptomatology
P(+), the rates of those whose GP was aware of the patients’
depressive symptomatology P(+/+) were calculated.
Additionally, the group P(−/+) was further investi￾gated: This combination may result from patients with a
diagnosis of depressive symptomatology who received
successful medical treatment and are currently in
remission. Those patients would not screen positive, but
the GP may be aware of a depressive disorder. This
might result in a seemingly false positive diagnosis but
can be differentiated in the GPs’ statements (“history
of depression” instead of “current depressive symp￾toms” or “current depression”). Taking this into account
and following the recommendation of Joling et al. to con￾sider antidepressant prescriptions [35], an alternative
awareness-rate was calculated, which defines all patients
as P(+) who screened positive for depressive symptom￾atology or who were taking prescription antidepressants.
Accordingly, the definition of awareness was expanded to
include GP ratings of “depressive symptoms”, “depression”
or “history of depression”.
The baseline data was analyzed with SPSS Version 20.
Descriptive analyses were performed to compare the
groups. Logistic regression analyses were calculated to
investigate factors associated with the GPs’ (un-) aware￾ness of their patients’ depressive symptoms. Significant
associations were assumed when p ≤ 0.05. No data
imputation strategies were applied.
Ethics approval
The study was conducted in compliance with the
Declaration of Helsinki. The study protocol was ap￾proved by the local Ethics Committees (Main study:
Medical Association of Hamburg, Approval No. PV3889;
Ethics Committee of the Medical Faculty of the Univer￾sity of Würzburg, Approval No. 125/12. Substudy: Ethics
Committee at the University of Göttingen Medical
Center, Approval No. 19/8/11).
Results
Sampling frame
Of 13,830 HF patients invited by their GPs, 4909 patients
consented to participate in the study and sent back a base￾line questionnaire (see Fig. 1). After random deselection
and exclusion of patients not fulfilling the inclusion criteria,
3224 patients were included into the analysis. The patient
characteristics are displayed in Table 2. The 3224 patients
were treated by 272 GPs of which 73.9% were male. They
had a mean of 15.2 (SD 9.4) years of professional experi￾ence. A mean of 2.1 GPs worked in each practice (SD 1.1)
and 18.8% had further education in psychology/psychiatry
(three had additionally specialized in psychiatry, neurology
or psychosomatics; forty-five had further training in

were conducted a mean of 0.9 (±0.8) months after the pa￾tients filled out the questionnaire.

depressive symptomatology, P (−/−) Patients screened

Rates of depressive symptomatology and GPs’ awareness
of depressive symptomatology
Of the 4909 incoming questionnaires, 690 screened posi￾tive for depressive symptomatology P (+). This is an
overall rate of depressive symptomatology of 14.1%. Of
the 690 patients, 574 were eligible for further analysis
(see Fig. 1 group P (+)). Table 2 displays the number and
characteristics of patients in each of the four groups
P(+/+), P(+/−), P(−/−) and P (−/+) in detail. The GPs
were aware of their patients’ depressive symptomatology
(sensitivity) in 35.0% of all patients who screened posi￾tive for depressive symptomatology, while the GPs were
not aware of the depressive symptomatology of 65.0% of
the positively screened patients (see Table 2). The GPs
stated no depressive symptomatology (specificity) in
84.1% of all patients who screened negative for depres￾sive symptomatology.
Noteworthy, GPs stated a depressive symptomatology
in 15.9% of the P(−) patients in the telephone interviews,
even though the patients did not screen positive for
depressive symptomatology P (−/+).
These patients had a relatively high rate of taking pre￾scription antidepressants (27.6%) and the alternative
awareness rate (see methods section for definition) was
calculated. This alternative awareness rate was consider￾ably higher than the originally estimated awareness rate:
407 of 772 HF patients (50.7%) were identified as suffering
from depressive symptomatology by the GP.
Factors associated with GPs’ awareness of depressive
symptomatology
The results of the logistic regression (dependent vari￾able: awareness of depressive symptomatology) are dis￾played in Table 3. The model includes both patient and

included in the models for depressive symptomatology
to maintain comparability with other studies. Factors
associated with the awareness of depressive symptomatol￾ogy were: higher patient education levels, a history of de￾pression known to the GP, GP-consultation due to
emotional distress within the last 6 months, a higher fre￾quency of GP contacts within the last 6 months, a higher
NYHA class and a more severe depressive symptomatol￾ogy. None of the GP characteristics were significantly
associated with the awareness of depressive symptomatol￾ogy in HF patients.
Discussion
Main results
In this observational study, depressive symptomatology
was found in 14.1% of primary care patients with HF,
when applying the algorithm established in a previous
substudy [30]. GPs were aware of the depressive sym￾ptomatology of 35% of their patients with a positive
depression screening, which is lower than hypothesized.
Factors with the strongest association with the aware￾ness of depressive symptomatology were: higher patient
education levels (OR 3.6 for tertiary education compared
to primary education), a history of depression known to
the GP (OR 6.2), GP-consultation due to emotional dis￾tress within the last 6 months (OR 3.2), and a higher
NYHA class (OR 2.5 for NYHA class III-IV compared to
I-II). Contrary to our hypothesis, none of the investi￾gated GP-based factors were significantly associated with
the GP’s awareness of depressive symptomatology.
Low rates of depressive symptomatology
The rates of depressive symptomatology in our present
study are on the lower end of rates found in other stud￾ies. A systematic review [36] found rates of comorbid
depression between 13% and 48% in outpatients with
HF, depending on the assessment tools used and the HF
severity. We explain the low rates in our study as due in
part to the chosen screening algorithm and recruitment
strategy. The algorithm adjusts for overlapping symp￾toms between depression and HF and, therefore, is more
conservative than screening instruments with cut-off
values for the general population (as administered in
other studies, like in Cully et al.’s study [9]). This might
lead to an over-estimation of depression rates in HF
patients in other studies. Furthermore, HF patients with
depressive symptomatology might be less likely to re￾spond to an invitation letter from their GP than HF
patients without depressive symptomatology. Therefore,
we cannot exclude that true rates of depressive symp￾tomatology in HF patients in primary care are slightly
higher than the rates we found.
Low GP awareness rates of depressive symptomatology
The awareness rates of depression in our study are
considerably lower than hypothesized. There are several
explanations which can be divided into formal (such as
the studied population and the definition of awareness/
recognition) and practical reasons:
The GPs’ rate of correct diagnoses of depression in HF
patients after hospital discharge where higher in the
studies by Koenig et al. (63.2%) [19] and Cully et al.
(57.5% recognition of depression/anxiety) [9] than the

rate found in our study (35%). Both cited studies re￾cruited patients via a hospital and, therefore, probably
included more severely ill HF patients with a higher
prevalence of depression and more severe symptoms than
the patients included in this study. The higher recognition
rates in the cited studies compared to the rate in our study
may be attributed to the more frequent and more severe
depressive disorders as well as a more intense aftercare
following hospital discharge. We also showed that the
alternative awareness rate in our study rises to 50.7%
depending on the definition of depressive symptomatology
and the definition of awareness, which then corresponds
to the overall recognition rate of 47.3% found by Mitchell
et al. in a meta-analysis in primary care patients [18]. Add￾itionally, we assume that the study focus on comorbidity
instead of depression better corresponds to the clinical
practice and prevented artificially elevated awareness
rates. Therefore, the rates in the present study might be
more accurate than in studies where the focus on depres￾sion was known to the GP.
There are several possible practical reasons for the
low awareness rates found in our present study:
Firstly, symptoms of depression might not be pre￾sented to the GP. This corresponds with our finding
that consulting the GP due to emotional distress
raised the GP’s chance of awareness. Secondly, in
everyday practice, concurrent issues such as the treat￾ment of somatic problems might be considered more
relevant at the time. Thirdly, the symptom overlap be￾tween HF and depression, as well as, the volatility of
depressive symptoms complicates their recognition.
Fourthly, we hypothesize that GPs do not diagnose de￾pression before they initiate a treatment or before
there is a need for action on their part. Therefore, they
might have answered the question if the patient
displayed symptoms of depression with “no” even
though they knew about them. This hypothesis is sup￾ported by Cully et al., who showed that 92.3% of all
HF patients diagnosed with depression and/or anxiety
had received corresponding treatment [9]. Further,
studies in primary care have shown that GPs’ diagno￾ses of depression differ from psychiatrically based
diagnostic criteria such as ICD-10 [37, 38] and DSM
IV [39]. For example, GPs tend to attribute depression
mainly to a reaction to certain circumstances [37]
[39], a “grey area” [38], and are reluctant to diagnose
depression, if the circumstances seem to explain a pa￾tient’s depressive symptoms. However, even if symp￾toms can be explained by circumstances, a patient
might suffer from an actual depressive episode and
may benefit from treatment. Thus, there are probably
HF patients who would benefit from depression treat￾ment, but don’t receive treatment because the GP is
not aware of their depressive symptomatology.
Factors associated with (un-)awareness of depressive
symptomatology
In this study we found that a history of depression known
to the GP and consulting the GP due to emotional distress
significantly raised the likelihood of the GP being
aware of depression. This is in line with earlier re￾search [19, 40–42]. Further studies showed that the
frequency of GP consultations [40, 41] and the sever￾ity of depressive symptomatology [9, 42] was signifi￾cantly associated with GP awareness, which was also
confirmed in our study.
Furthermore, we found that the GPs’ awareness of de￾pressive symptomatology was higher in patients with
NYHA classes III-IV than patients in NYHA classes I-II,
when controlling for the severity of depressive symptom￾atology. Cully et al. did not find an association between
a patient’s NYHA class and the GP’s recognition of
depression (but did not include NYHA class I patients)
[9]. One explanation for the unexpected finding could
be that patients with a higher NYHA class are known to
have more severe depressive symptoms [5] and, there￾fore, are also more likely to present depressive symp￾toms during the GP consultation than patients with less
severe HF and fewer coexisting depressive symptoms.
We did not find a significant association between a
GP’s awareness of depressive symptomatology and a
patient’s age or sex; but there was a positive associ￾ation with patients’ education levels. Findings con￾cerning the influence of age, sex and education are
inconsistent [9, 19, 40, 42]. However, in our study,
patients with primary education were found to have a
lower chance of their GPs being aware of their de￾pressive symptomatology. Therefore, GPs should pay
special attention to this group of HF patients.
Contrary to our hypothesis, we found no significant
associations between a GP’s awareness of depressive
symptomatology and any of the GP-based factors: gen￾der, years of residency, training in psychology/psychiatry,
or number of GPs practicing in the physician’s practice.
This corresponds with the findings of Piek et al. and
Wittchen et al. who found no association between the
recognition of depression and the factors: GP gender,
years of GP-experience, training in depression or in psych￾iatry in the past year [40] or the number of depression￾specific continuing education courses taken by the GP
[42]. The number of GPs practicing in the physician’s
practice could also be interpreted as a proxy for practice
size and was not a significant predictor of a GP’s aware￾ness of depressive symptomatology in our study. This is in
line with the review by Mitchell and Rao [18].
Strengths and limitations
In contrast to other studies on the recognition of de￾pression [19], our study included patients with and
Eisele et al. BMC Family Practice (2017) 18:71 Page 8 of 11

without depressive symptomatology and asked about a
variety of patients’ comorbidities without revealing a
specific focus on depression, a potential bias in other
studies. Therefore, the present study focused on the GP’s
statement as to whether or not a patient displayed depres￾sive symptomatology (in this case the sum of medical
record data and GP memory, which is interpreted as a
GP’s awareness of a patient’s depressive symptomatology),
rather than investigating whether or not the GP recog￾nized it. In accordance, the GP was asked whether the
patient displays depressive symptomatology and not if he/
she would diagnose a depressive disorder. These choices
have been made to reflect everyday practice as accurately
as possible and the term “awareness” instead of “recogni￾tion” of depressive symptomatology was chosen. Further￾more, a sub-study developed an algorithm of optimal cut
off values in self-administered depression instruments in a
different cohort of patients with HF, to consider the symp￾tom overlap between depression and HF.
However, the study also has some limitations. One
limitation is that, although created especially for HF
patients, our screening algorithm has a PPV of 69%.
Thus, 31% of the patients who screened positive for
depressive symptomatology do not have a current de￾pressive disorder. We addressed this limitation by asking
the GP, if the patient displays depressive symptomatol￾ogy instead of asking if the patient meets the criteria for
a diagnosis of depression. It can be assumed that all
positively screened patients displayed some depressive
symptomatology, even if it was not severe enough to be
diagnosed as a depressive disorder. However, GPs should
be aware of these sub threshold symptoms, because they
have been found prognostically relevant, even without
fulfilling a formal diagnosis of depression [43]. Also,
false-positive rates of depression awareness might actu￾ally reflect depressive patients with a successful depres￾sion treatment, who are in remission and, therefore, are
no longer identified as depressed by our algorithm. To
address this limitation, we calculated alternative awa￾reness rates of depressive symptomatology and also
present data for the groups P (−/−) and P (−/+). Further,
the outcome criterion of GP awareness is derived from
the GP’s statement whether or not the patient displays
depressive symptomatology. However, we cannot ex￾clude that a GP might be aware of a patient’s depressive
symptomatology, but for some reason (e.g. symptoms
are not judged as severe enough to be stated) did not
state them. Furthermore, the method of telephone inter￾view carries the risk of recall errors. Therefore, true
awareness rates might be higher than reported. Lastly
the GP (6.6%) and patient (35.5%) response rates were
lower than expected. This might have led to an under￾representation of GPs with high workloads as well as
patients severely affected by HF or depression.
Implications for practice
According to our results, GPs are more likely to miss
depressive symptomatology in patients without a known
history of depression, who did not consult their GP be￾cause of emotional distress, and those with lower levels
of education. The awareness rates could be improved, if
GPs encourage their HF patients to address emotional
distress and held detailed medical interviews including a
patient’s history of depression. This remains to be
proven in interventional studies. The recommendation
to routinely apply screening instruments in HF patients
remains questionable as the evidence of its benefit still
remains to be provided [16]. Furthermore, it involves the
risk of increased false-positive recognition rates [18, 44]
and, thus, inappropriate therapies or overtreatment.
Therefore, screening instruments for depression in
primary care patients with HF should only be applied, if
a GP is unsure about a patient’s depression after a thor￾ough examination. Simple screening questions for emo￾tional distress and past depression asked routinely
during the medical interview might be preferable, espe￾cially for patients with lower education levels. The effect
of this mini-intervention on the GP’s awareness of
depressive symptomatology in patients with HF remains
to be investigated.
The comparably low awareness rates are probably not
based on GPs’ lacking knowledge of diagnostic criteria,
because, in the present study as well as in a randomized
controlled trial [45], GPs’ further psychological educa￾tion did not increase the rate of awareness/recognition
of depression. Instead, there is evidence that GPs view
the psychiatry-based criteria as inappropriate for general
practice [39].
Implications for research
The definition of awareness or recognition rates has a
great impact on the percentage of recognized patients.
GPs seem to have their own diagnostic criteria (includ￾ing gut feeling) which differ from the psychiatric criteria
[38]. When investigating recognition rates these aspects
need to be considered in the definition of “recognition”
and in the choice of criteria used to identify patients
with depression.
Koenig et al. found that hospital physicians and GPs
were more likely to identify depression warranting treat￾ment in HF patients whose depression persisted at least
12 weeks [19]. This is a finding which might support the
sensitivity of GP rating. It remains to be investigated to
what extent the psychiatric criteria are a better or worse
indicator for predicting the future quality of life and
prognosis of HF patients, and to what extent this reveals
a need for action to increase the awareness rates of
depressive symptomatology in HF patients in primary
care. Therefore, low recognition rates in primary care as
Eisele et al. BMC Family Practice (2017) 18:71 Page 9 of 11

judged by psychiatry-based screening instruments need
to be carefully investigated regarding patient relevant
outcomes.
Conclusions
Many aspects, including the definition of awareness and
practical issues in primary care, may have contributed to
unexpected low GP awareness rates of depressive symp￾tomatology in HF patients in primary care. The aware￾ness rates might rise, if GPs encourage their patients to
talk about emotional distress, held detailed medical
interviews including a patient’s history of depression and
pay special attention to HF patients with lower educa￾tion levels. However, it remains to be investigated
whether GP judgement is a better or worse indicator of
the future prognosis and quality of life in HF patients
compared to psychiatry-based diagnostic criteria. It also
needs to be investigated to what extent this information
induces a need for action.
