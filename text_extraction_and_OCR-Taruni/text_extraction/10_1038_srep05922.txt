Transferring gut microbiota from one individual to another may enable researchers to ‘‘humanize’’ the
gut of animal models and transfer phenotypes between species. To date, most studies of gut microbiota
transfer are performed in germ-free mice. In the studies presented, it was tested whether an antibiotic
treatment approach could be used instead. C57BL/6 mice were treated with ampicillin prior to
inoculation at weaning or eight weeks of age with gut microbiota from lean or obese donors. The gut
microbiota and clinical parameters of the recipients was characterized one and six weeks after
inoculation. The results demonstrate, that the donor gut microbiota was introduced, established, and
changed the gut microbiota of the recipients. Six weeks after inoculation, the differences persisted,
however alteration of the gut microbiota occurred with time within the groups. The clinical parameters
of the donor phenotype were partly transmissible from obese to lean mice, in particularly b cell
hyperactivity in the obese recipients. Thus, a successful inoculation of gut microbiota was not age
dependent in order for the microbes to colonize, and transferring different microbial compositions to
conventional antibiotic-treated mice was possible at least for a time period during which the microbiota
may permanently modulate important host functions.
An accelerating appreciation and exploration of our ‘‘forgotten organ’’ is increasingly advancing our
understanding of how the gut microbiota can act as a regulator of human health. Before the infant is
born, its gastrointestinal tract is sterile, but at birth and soon thereafter it acquires bacteria from the
surrounding environment and the mother1
. Once established, the microbiota remains relatively stable in the
adult2 with a concentration of about 1011 colony forming units per gram feces3
. However, environmental factors
such as diets can cause shifts in the composition, known as dysbiosis, which in several studies have been associated
with the onset of chronic inflammatory diseases such as diabetes4 and metabolic syndrome5
. For example, changes
in the gut microbiota have been associated with an obese phenotype, in particular increased Firmi￾cutes:Bacteroidetes ratio in obese individuals compared to lean individuals5,6. Furthermore, in another study
the Prevotella spp. (Bacteroidetes) to Eubacterium rectale ratio (Firmicutes) was positively correlated to plasma
glucose levels7
. It is reasonable to assume that the gut microbiota affects weight gain since it promotes increased
uptake of monosaccharides and storage of triglyceride in adipocytes in the host and plays an essential role in
processing of dietary polysaccharides8
. This became apparent along with fecal transplantation experiments in
which the transmissible dysbiosis from obese lepob and lean wild-type mice9 or from obese humans and their lean
twins10 to adult germ-free (GF) mice demonstrated greater increase in body fat for mice colonized with an ‘obese’
gut microbiota. Moreover, GF mice, in contrast to conventionally raised mice, are resistant to increased body
weight when fed a high fat diet11, demonstrating the importance of microbiota in obesity.
Especially gnotobiotic mice in which the contribution of a specific composition of gut microbes to disease
development can be investigated have been useful to characterize potential immunological and metabolic path￾ways involved in disease pathogenesis. However, treating dysbiosis in co-housing experiments of rodents have
also shown promising results; for example co-housing lean and obese mice resulted in a transfer of gut microbiota
from the lean to the obese mice which prevented weight gain10. Also in humans, treating patients suffering from
Clostridium difficile infection with stool transplant from healthy individuals was proven successful12.
Transferring microbiota was previously shown to be optimal at three weeks of age by inoculating GF mice
which subsequently were housed in specific pathogen free (SPF) conditions13,14. In the present study, the feas￾ibility of transferring gut microbiota from lean and obese mice to conventional mice was therefore investigated by

reducing the existing gut microbiota with antibiotic treatment prior
to inoculation. If possible, it would be a step further towards enabling
researchers to manipulate gut microbiota and phenotype of animal
models partly in place of more labour-demanding and expensive
gnotobiotic mice. However, the timing of inoculation to conven￾tional recipients may be critical14. Thus, two studies were performed:
1) A weaning study, in which C57BL/6 dams were treated with
ampicillin from one week prior to birth until weaning of the pups
at three weeks of age, and pups were inoculated at weaning with a
lean or obese mouse gut microbiota. 2) An adult study, in which
C57BL/6 mice were inoculated at eight weeks of age, after three weeks
of ampicillin treatment, with a lean or obese mouse gut microbiota.
We thereby sought to investigate if gut microbiota transfer in
antibiotic-treated mice was possible; if the gut microbiota of the
recipients would resemble the donor microbiota they were given; if
time of inoculation mattered and how stable the inoculum was in the
recipients. The animals were furthermore monitored for parameters
related to the metabolic phenotype of the donors.
Results
Gut microbiota differ between mice inoculated with lean and
obese cecal content. Three weeks of ampicillin treatment prior to
inoculation of cecal content from donors reduced the majority of
bacterial groups in the gut. Ampicillin has previously been shown to
be the drug that most consistently reduce gut bacterial density15
which was also evident by denaturing gradient electrophoresis
(DGGE) profiles of 16S rRNA gene PCR derived amplicons of
fecal samples from the recipient mice, where only few bands emer￾ged on the gel (Figure 1a). No difference in the gut microbiota before
inoculation was evident between the groups, and the gut microbiota
was equally reduced in both the adult treated mice and in the pups
from antibiotic-treated mothers (not shown).
In the weaning study, the recipient mice clustered into two major
groups one week after inoculation according to donor on the PCA
analysis of fecal DGGE profiles, indicating a successful differenti￾ation of either C57BL/6 or B6.-Lepob donor microbiota upon col￾onization (Figure 1b; P , 0.001 for PC3 explaining 8.8% of the
variance). There was still a significant difference in the DGGE fecal
profiles between the B6.-Lepob and the lean C57BL/6 recipient group
two (P , 0.05 for PC2 explaining 11.7% of the variance), three (P ,
0.05 for PC2 explaining 15.3% of the variance), four (P , 0.05 for
PC2 explaining 12.1% of the variance), and six (Figure 1c; P , 0.001
for PC2 explaining 12.8% of the variance) weeks after inoculation
(data not shown). Gender did not have any effect on the gut micro￾biota composition of the recipients.
The mice inoculated at eight weeks of age also clustered separately
between the groups one week after inoculation (Figure 1d; P , 0.01
for PC1 explaining 15.6% of the variance), though less related to the
donors than was seen in the weaning study (the differences are in
addition visualized in plots of PC values, Figure 1f–h). A group of
mice receiving only PBS was included in the adult study and they
were significantly different than the mice receiving BALB/c
(Figure 1d1f; P , 0.001 for PC1) and B6.-Lepob donor microbiota
(Figure 1d1f; P , 0.01 for PC1). They were most likely only slowly
recolonized from the environment and therefore lacked several
bands on the gel (Figure 1l). No difference was observed in diversity
between the obese and lean recipients in neither study at any time
point. Six weeks after inoculation a significant difference in gut
microbiota composition was still present between recipients of the
obese B6.-Lepob and lean BALB/c donor microbiota (Figure 1e1j; P
, 0.01 for PC2 explaining 10% of the variation), and the mice that
received PBS were still significantly different from the B6.-Lepob
recipient mice (Figure 1e1j; P , 0.01 for PC2 and P , 0.01 for
PC3 explaining 9% of the variance) and BALB/c (P 50.06 for
PC3). There were no longer any clear difference in the diversity of
the microbiota between the groups receiving donor microbiota and
PBS (Figure 1m).
Taxonomic differences between mice inoculated with B6.-Lepob or
C57BL/6 microbiota does not persist. To investigate the effect of
the inoculations further, a comparison of different taxa in the micro￾biota of donors and recipients was performed in the weaning study.
The abundances of bacterial taxa in the microbiota profiles of the two
donors revealed a lower abundance of Bacteroidetes (Figure 2f) and
Bacteroides (Figure 2g) in the B6.-Lepob donor compared to the lean
C57BL/6 donor. One week after inoculation, the B6.-Lepob recipients
also had a significantly lower abundance of Bacteroidetes but not the
Bacteroides, and a significantly higher abundance of B. fragilis
(Figure 2h) and Enterobacteriaceae (Figure 2k) was evident. Six
weeks after inoculation these differences were no longer present. In
mice inoculated with C57BL/6 donor microbiota, a tendency towards
a reduction in the taxa Bacteroides and Parabacteroides diastonis
from one to six weeks after inoculation was evident, thus the
microbiota changed over time after inoculation (Figure 2m, P 5
0.083 and P 5 0.095, respectively) as also observed in the PCA
plots of DGGE profiles. In recipients of the B6.-Lepob donor
microbiota, significant increases in the abundance of Firmicutes
and Lactobacillus spp., and a decrease in B. fragilis were observed
from one to six weeks post inoculation (Figure 2n; P , 0.05).
Furthermore, a tendency towards an increase in Bacteroidetes (P
5 0.095) and a decrease in Enterobactericeae (P 5 0.089) was
evident, which likely explain the lack of difference between the
B6.-Lepob and C57BL/6 recipients six weeks post inoculation.
Recipients of B6.-Lepob microbiota have increased b cell response
to glucose despite only minor increase in weight gain and fat
deposition. Males and females were significantly different in body
weight (Figure 3a–b; P , 0.001 and Figure 4a–b; P , 0.01)) and total
food consumption (Figure 3c; P , 0.05, and Figure 4c; P , 0.0001).
In addition, both male and female recipient mice of the obese micro￾biota had a higher weight gain than the lean recipients inoculated as
adults, whereas this was not evident in the mice inoculated at
weaning. Food consumption was furthermore elevated in male
B6.-Lepob recipient mice inoculated at weaning compared to lean
recipients whereas this was not significantly different in the mice
inoculated as adults (n52). Food consumption in one of the cages
with four female BALB/c recipient mice was lower than the B6.-Lepob
recipient mice, but not in the other cage, and thus not significant on
cage level. There was also a gender difference in total weight of body
fat pads (P , 0.05, Figure 3c) and a strong tendency for larger body
fat pads was found in the male B6.-Lepob recipients compared to lean
microbiota recipients inoculated at weaning (P 5 0.057).
No effect of inoculation on glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c%), a
measure of the stable blood glucose concentration over time, was
observed in neither the young nor the adult inoculated mice
(Figure 3e and Figure 4d respectively). There seemed to be no dif￾ference in insulin resistance between the groups in the glucose tol￾erance tests as both groups similarly cleared the high glucose level,
however the peak of blood glucose was significantly or borderline
higher in the lean microbiota recipient mice compared to B6.-Lepob
recipient mice 4–6 weeks after inoculation at both weaning and eight
weeks of age (Figure 3f–h and Figure 4e). AUC was furthermore
significantly lower (P , 0.05) in the B6.-Lepob recipient mice four
weeks after inoculation at weaning compared to the lean recipient
group. The increase in serum insulin level after inoculation at wean￾ing was significantly higher in B6.-Lepob recipient mice compared to
recipient mice of lean microbiota (P , 0.05; Figure 3i).

istance9,16–19. In this study, C57BL/6 mice were inoculated with cecal
contents from lean or obese mice, after depleting the majority of the
existing gut microbiota by ampicillin treatment. By this we sought to
investigate whether transfer of gut microbiota under conventional
conditions was possible in the same manner observed in germ-free
isolators, and whether or not this was dependent on age upon inocu￾lation. Indeed, the gut microbiota in recipient mice one week after
inoculation clustered according to the microbiota suspension with
which they were inoculated. The similarity to the donors was
however more pronounced in the mice inoculated at weaning.
Furthermore, changes in gut microbiota composition between the
groups persisted until six weeks after inoculation when analysed by
DGGE, but the microbiota also shifted with time within the groups
and, thus, the inoculum was not stable as previously documented in
GF mice. It is also important to note, that the effect was only inves￾tigated in mice pre-treated with antibiotics to mimic some of the
effects in GF mice. It has therefore yet to be investigated if the
phenotype could be transferred to non-treated mice in the same
manner.
The mice in the weaning study were likely to be under more
environmental influence than in the adult study as they were raised
conventionally with no attempt to sterilize cage interior, bedding,
food or drinking water, enabling bacteria from the environment to
colonize the gut. However, as the colonization process was equally or
more successful in the weaning study, there was no advantage of
autoclaving cages and assorted items. Furthermore, diversification
of the mouse gut microbiota usually occurs at three weeks of age,
likely due to a decrease in maternal immunoglobulin A (IgA) supply
when mice stop suckling, making this a proper time point for inocu￾lation with gut microbiota20. Recipients in the adult study had a
higher diversity of gut microbiota within the groups than the controls
receiving PBS one week after inoculation, suggesting that the recipi￾ents colonize on the inoculation given. This difference was, however,
diminished six weeks after inoculation, suggesting, that the mice not
receiving any inoculation slowly re-colonize themselves. A signifi￾cant difference in clustering was still observed between recipients of
lean and obese donor microbiota six weeks after inoculation suggest￾ing a successful long term inoculation for at least some of the intro￾duced species. Based on the DGGE results, transfer of gut microbiota
subsequent to antibiotic treatment thus seems a likely method for
successful transfer of microbiota in non-germ-free conditions.
GULDA analysis revealed that the major changes in the gut micro￾biota profile of B6-Lepob recipient mice compared to C57BL/6 recipi￾ent mice was a lower abundance of Bacteriodetes21,22, which was also
evident in the donors. However, six weeks post inoculation recipients
no longer showed these taxa specific characteristic differences

between the lean and obese inoculated groups. It is therefore ques￾tionable how persistent the establishment of the inoculum is even
though the groups still separated on the PCA plot of DGGE profiles.
In a study where different strains of mice were treated with antibio￾tics for one week beginning at five weeks of age, their differences in
microbiota were diminished, but the differences returned when
antibiotic treatment was terminated and each strain got back its
strain-specific microbiota within one week23, which suggest that host
characteristics strongly influence the gut microbiota. However, it is
important to note that GULDA analysis was only performed with the
chosen bacterial primers and that the differences seen on DGGE at
six weeks post inoculation could be due to other, less dominant,
strains which were not analyzed by GULDA.
Even if the gut microbiota in the inoculated mice changed over
time it would still be expected to influence important host func￾tions as it has previously been shown that the gut microbiota, in an
early limited window of time, can determine immune responses
and glucose homeostasis later in life14,19,24. The obese phenotype
has previously been shown to be transmissible with microbiota9
,
and similar changes was in the present study observed for the
recipient mice, independent of age upon inoculation. The differ￾ences in weight and metabolic parameters were however minor
compared to what was previously observed in gnotobiotic mice.
It is thus possible that permanent dysbiosis is required for the
obese phenotype to develop in the recipients. However, it is intri￾guing that despite the fact that the gut microbiota only partly
resembled the donors, the phenotypes of the donors were to some
degree still transmissible both at weaning and as adults. The peak
in glucose concentrations in OGTT seems to be the metabolic
parameter mostly affected by the change in gut microbiota in both
the young and adult inoculated mice despite the minor effects on
weight and fat pads. Most likely, the pancreatic b cells of B6.-Lepob
recipient mice produce more insulin upon glucose stimulation
which is supported by the higher increase in insulin levels. This
is interesting as hyperinsulinemia is characteristic in obesity, prob￾ably as an adaptive response of the b cells to compensate for
increased insulin resistance25. It is also possible that the gut micro￾biota may have a direct effect on the b cells.
It is interesting, that co-housing mice with lean and obese micro￾biota has been shown to result in a transfer of gut microbiota from
the lean to the obese mice which prevented weight gain, whereas the
reverse transfer of microbiota from obese to lean mice was not evid￾ent10. Also, in a human study, male subjects with metabolic syndrome
were given infusions of small intestinal microbiota from lean donors,
which improved their peripheral insulin sensitivity six weeks after
infusion26. Consequently, it would be highly relevant to investigate
the proposed conventionally raised antibiotic-treated model with
lean donors and obese antibiotic-treated recipients in order to see
a more pronounced transfer of the metabolic phenotype.
In conclusion, inoculation of conventional antibiotic-treated
mice with gut microbiota from lean or obese donors was possible
and age independent, and clustering of the inoculation groups
persisted until six weeks post inoculation, but it was not stable
as the compositional characteristics of the recipient microbiota
changed with time. Nonetheless, although a final alternative to
GF mice is not established, the minor changes in weight gain, food
consumption, body fat pads, insulin production, and glucose tol￾erance observed are not insignificant. Further investigations using
obese and non-treated recipients will further enlighten the possibil￾ity of alternatives to GF models. In addition, early life changes in
gut microbiota, even in a limited time frame, have several times
proven critical for development of proper immune functions and
pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory diseases such as colitis and
type 1 diabetes27,28. It is therefore possible, that the approach pre￾sented in this paper would have a more pronounced outcome also
in other disease models.
Methods
Animals and experimental design. Experiments were carried out in accordance with
the EU directive 2010/63/EU, and the Danish Animal Experimentation Act (LBK
1306 from 23/11/2007 with 2010 amendments), and approved by the Animal
Experimentation Inspectorate, Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Fisheries,
Denmark.
Weaning study. C57BL/6 mice (Taconic, Cat# B6JBOM-F and B6JBOM-M) were
mated and from one week before birth ampicillin (Ampivet, 1g/L) was added to
drinking water until the pups were weaned at three weeks of age. 9 male and 19 female
pups were randomized into two groups and inoculated with cecum content from
either a 12 week old B6.-Lepob (Taconic, kindly supplied by Umea˚, Sweden) or a
C57BL/6 (Taconic, Cat# B6JBOM-M) mouse, which had been housed in the same
facility for a week before they were euthanized. Each group of recipients were split
into four cages. They were housed under standard conditions in open cages without
filter lids and fed ad libitum with a 1324 chow diet (Altromin Cat# 1324) and had ad
libitum access to bottled water.
Adult study. C57BL/6 mice (Taconic) were born at the facility and housed in a
Scantainer in autoclaved open cages with autoclaved materials. The mice were fed ad
libitum with an autoclaved 1324 chow diet (Altromin, Cat# 1324TPF) and at five
weeks of age 24 female and 24 male recipient mice were treated with ampicillin
(Ampivet, 1g/L) in the drinking water for three weeks before they were inoculated
with cecum content from either B6.-Lepob (Charles River, Cat# 000632) or BALB/c
mice (Taconic, Cat# BALB-M) which had been housed in the same facility for a week
before they were euthanized. One group received PBS and was thus recolonized with
microbes from the environment. Each group of recipients were split into four cages
(two cages containing males and two cages containing females in each group), and the
water was switched back to sterilized bottled water after inoculation. All mice in both
experiments were weighed weekly.
Gut microbiota transfer. Donor mice were euthanized and immediately transferred
to an anaerobic chamber, in which the ceca were aseptically removed and the content
was diluted 1510 in a 50% glycerol/PBS solution. The content was thereafter divided
into aliquots and frozen in liquid nitrogen and thereafter stored at 280uC. At the day
of inoculation the cecum solution was further diluted 155 prior to oral gavage of
0.15 mL per mouse.
Gut microbiota characterization. Fecal samples were collected in autoclaved
eppendorf tubes and stored at 280uC until further processing. Cellular DNA was
extracted using the QIAamp DNA Stool Mini Kit (Qiagen, Cat# 51504) according to
manufacturer’s instructions, and including a step of bead beading to optimize the
DNA outcome. The DNA was amplified by means of PCR, using primers specific to
the V3 region of the 16S rRNA gene. Amplicons were randomized and thereafter
analyzed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) using an acrylamide gel
containing a 25%–65% chemical gradient (urea and formamide) that enabled
separation of the PCR amplicons based on sequence differences in the V3 region. PCR
and DGGE conditions are reported elsewhere29. The DGGE profiles were analyzed in
Bionumerics Version 4.5 (Applied Maths) using a mix of DNA profiles as a marker.
In the weaning study, the gut microbiota was further characterized by real-time
PCR based Gut Low-Density Array (GULDA), used as previously described30.
Relative quantification of the following bacterial groups was included; Firmicutes,
Lactobacillus spp., Clostridial clusters IV and XIV, Clostridium butyricum (cluster I),
Enterococcus spp., Bacteroidetes, Bacteroides spp., B. fragilis, Parabacteroides dia￾stonis, Prevotella spp., Alistipes spp., Bifidobacterium spp., Enterobacteriaceae, and
Akkermansia muciniphila. The relative abundance of each bacterial gene target was
determined by normalizing with a universal bacterial primer-target, to give a mea￾surement of total bacteria.
Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT). The mice were fasted for six to ten hours prior
to testing. At time 0 the mice were challenged with an oral dose of 50 mg (weaning
study) or 2 mg/g (adult study) glucose, and blood glucose was thereafter measured at
15, 30, 60, 90, 120 and 180 minutes post glucose challenge. Blood was drawn by
puncturing the lateral tail vein, and blood glucose was measured using a glucometer
(Abbott Diabetes Care, Cat# 70808).
Measuring glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c). A 1 uL blood sample was taken from
the lateral tail vein, and HbA1c measured by using a DCA Vantage Analyzer (Siemens
Healthcare Diagnostics, Cat# 6651932).
Body fat analysis. Fat pads (inguinal, epididymal or uterine in males and females
respectively, and retroperitoneal fat pads) were collected in the weaning study and
weighed on a precision electron weight.
Fasting plasma insulin measurements. At each OGTT in the weaning study blood
samples for measurement of fasting plasma insulin concentration were taken 15
minutes before challenge with glucose solution, using the facial vein technique and
blood was collected in EDTA coated eppendorf tubes (Bie & Berntsen A/S, Herlev,
Denmark). Plasma was stored at 220uC until further analysis. Plasma insulin
concentrations were measured using a Mouse Insulin ELISA kit (Mercodia, Uppsala,
Sweden) according to manufacturer’s protocol.

Statistics. Statistical analysis was carried out using Minitab 16 software (Minitab Inc)
and GraphPad Prism version 5.02 (GraphPad Software). In all analyses, gender, cage,
and gel number were included as a factor to ensure the statistical outcome was a result
of group differences and not a statistical bias. In parameters with gender difference,
the statistics were made for each gender. For comparison of groups, a Students t-test
or ANOVA with a Tukey or Bonferroni correction was used. For data, which were not
normally distributed by the D’Agoustino test or had unequal variances a Kruskal￾Wallis or Mann-Whitney test was used. Significance of variability was evaluated by
the general linear model. When repeated measurements were evaluated, repeated
measurements ANOVA and post hoc Bonferroni’s multiple comparisons correction
were used. P , 0.05 was considered statistically significant in all tests.
