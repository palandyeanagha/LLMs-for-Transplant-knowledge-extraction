Abstract
Background: Deceased donor kidneys for transplantation are in most countries allocated preferentially to recipients who
have limited co-morbidities. Little is known about the incremental health and economic gain from transplanting those with
co-morbidities compared to remaining on dialysis. The aim of our study is to estimate the average and incremental survival
benefits and health care costs of listing and transplantation compared to dialysis among individuals with varying co￾morbidities.
Methods: A probabilistic Markov model was constructed, using current outcomes for patients with defined co-morbidities
treated with either dialysis or transplantation, to compare the health and economic benefits of listing and transplantation
with dialysis.
Findings: Using the current waiting time for deceased donor transplantation, transplanting a potential recipient, with or
without co-morbidities achieves survival gains of between 6 months and more than three life years compared to remaining
on dialysis, with an average incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of less than $50,000/LYS, even among those with
advanced age. Age at listing and the waiting time for transplantation are the most influential variables within the model. If
there were an unlimited supply of organs and no waiting time, transplanting the younger and healthier individuals saves
the most number of life years and is cost-saving, whereas transplanting the middle-age to older patients still achieves
substantial incremental gains in life expectancy compared to being on dialysis.
Conclusions: Our modelled analyses suggest transplanting the younger and healthier individuals with end-stage kidney
disease maximises survival gains and saves money. Listing and transplanting those with considerable co-morbidities is also
cost-effective and achieves substantial survival gains compared with the dialysis alternative. Preferentially excluding the
older and sicker individuals cannot be justified on utilitarian grounds.

Introduction
End-stage kidney disease (ESKD) is a global health problem,
with currently over one million people worldwide living on some
form of renal replacement therapy [1]. Kidney transplantation is
the treatment of choice for most patients with ESKD because of
improved duration and quality of life compared with dialysis,
however demand for kidneys exceeds supply in all parts of the
world [2–4]. Despite the concerted international effort by
transplant authorities to increase the number of living donor
kidneys, through introduction of the paired kidney exchange and
ABO incompatible programs [5–9], many suitable potential
recipients are unable to find a suitable live donor. Deceased
donor transplantation is the only other alternative for people on
dialysis, but the availability of deceased donor organs is limited,
with a very small proportion of the prevalent dialysis population
(less than 30%, 25% and 10% in the United States, Europe and
Australia, respectively) receiving a deceased donor organ each year
[2–4].
Being on the deceased donor waiting list is a necessary step to
receiving a deceased donor transplant, but the listing or de-listing
criteria vary between countries and between transplant units [10].
Patient selection for listing is clinician and centre dependent,
which may lead to apparent disparity in decision-making
according to co-morbid status, age and socio-economic status.
For example, compared to patients without diabetes, the likelihood
PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 January 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 1 | e29591

of a diabetic being listed on the active waiting list is reduced by at
least 2-fold, perhaps or fear of poor outcomes after transplantation
[11]. Fewer than 5% of those on the transplant waiting list in
Australia are greater than 65 years old [2–4,12]. Minority groups
such as Indigenous populations have fewer referrals to transplant
centres, fewer complete transplant assessment and a much smaller
proportion become candidates for transplantation compared to
non-Indigenous populations [12–14]. Gender bias also exists in
many countries, with recent studies reporting a consistent and
significant negative association between being female and being
active on the transplant waiting list [15–18].
Although policy-makers and transplant authorities have at￾tempted to incorporate the principle of equity during the process
of rationing scarce organ resources, such as integrating the
recipients’ waiting time on dialysis and recipients’ immune
sensitisation status in allocation algorithms [2,3,19], allocation
policies have generally sought to maximise absolute graft and
recipient survival by limiting the high-risk groups (such as diabetic
patients or those with known cardiac disease), to transplantation
[20–23]. It is these same groups of patients who have the bleakest
prognosis on dialysis and may thereby achieve the greatest
incremental gains from transplantation. The potential gains in life
expectancy and health expenditure achieved by wait-listing people
with co-morbidities compared to non-waitlisting are largely
unknown. In this study, we aim to estimate the average and
incremental survival benefits and health care costs of being listed
on the deceased kidney donor waiting list compared to non
waitlisting among individuals on dialysis, to allow better and
informed decision-making around patient selection for listing.
Methods
From a third-party payer perspective, a probabilistic model was
developed to simulate the natural history of a hypothetical group
of potential candidates (n = 10,000), stratified according to their
underlying co-morbid states: history of cardiovascular disease,
diabetes mellitus, cerebrovascular disease, obesity, current smok￾ing and varying ages at listing and transplantation. These variables
were chosen because of the reduced patient and graft survival
associated with these co-morbidities [24].
Structure of the model
The simplified structure of the model is outlined in figure 1. The
cost-effectiveness model was constructed with two arms to
compare the health benefits (in life-years gains) and costs of listing
and transplanting potential candidates (with and without co￾morbidities) with the health benefits and costs if they were to
remain on dialysis. The progression of each individual through the
model was depended on the age-specific transition probabilities
through mutually exclusive health states of kidney transplantation
and dialysis. The entire lifetime of an individual was modelled,
whereby each transplant recipient was at risk of allograft failure
and subsequent return to dialysis at the end of each annual cycle.
The models assumed all transplant recipients were transplanted
only once: all failed transplant recipients were subsequently
managed on dialysis until death, and are represented by the black
arrows in Figure 1. The model terminated when all potential
recipients were deceased. We had set a priori the current Australian
rate of deceased donor transplantation and did not account for the
effects of variations in living donor transplantation.
We assumed the current average age of transplant (age = 45) [2–
4,12], the current waiting time and the annual probability of
receiving a deceased donor kidney on the transplant waiting list in
Australia. The risk of non-fatal cardiovascular events, and all￾cause mortality, and for transplant recipients, the risk of post￾transplant complications and events such as delayed graft function
and wound infections, were dependent upon their underlying co￾morbid health states. The model assumed a small proportion of
patients with ESKD chose not to proceed with any form of renal
replacement therapy. It also assumed a proportion of patients on
dialysis would withdraw from dialysis each year (and opt for
palliative and conservative management) and die during the
concurrent year. Among those who remained on dialysis, we
assumed an exponential relationship between the risk of dying
from cardiac and non-cardiac causes, and the total time spent on
dialysis.
Sensitivity analysis
Assumptions were tested over a range of plausible values to
assess the robustness of the uncertainties in the model’s parameter
estimates using sensitivity analyses. Using one-way sensitivity
analyses, we identified all the influential variables within the
model. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was also undertaken.
Instead of just using point estimates for parameter values, this
approach assigns a distribution to each model parameter, and
samples from that distribution using Monte Carlo simulation
[25,26] to estimate the expected value of each option. We used the
log-normal distributions for relative risks and gamma distributions
for costs, and randomly sampled over 10,000 iterations for each
variable of interest. Scenario analyses were also conducted to
assess the overall costs and benefits of deceased donor organ
transplantation compared to being on dialysis if there were
unlimited supply of deceased donor organs (i.e. no waiting time)
for all individuals with varying co-morbidities.
Ethics
Ethics approval for this study was not required as no new
participants were recruited for this study. Clinical parameter
estimates for the model were sourced from published literature and
from de-identified data from existing data registry.
Input parameter estimates for the model
Clinical data: A comprehensive literature search was conducted
to identify the best available data on the clinical events that
occurred before and after transplantation for recipients of kidney
transplants and patients on dialysis. Age-specific probabilities for
the following variables for transplant and dialysis patients were
sourced from de-identified data from the Australian and New
Zealand Dialysis and Transplant registry (ANZDATA) [27] and
the National Organ Matching Service (NOMS): probability of
receiving a deceased donor kidney transplant, graft failure and
return to dialysis, experiencing a non-fatal cardiac event, and all￾cause mortality. Other relevant data such as the probability of
experiencing a transplant-associated complication including de￾layed graft function, acute rejection, re-hospitalisation or death
was sourced from published literature. The ANZDATA Registry
holds the records of all patients on renal replacement therapy in
Australia and New Zealand since 1963 [27]. It contains
comprehensive information such as the incidence, prevalence
and outcomes data for all patients for whom indefinite renal
replacement therapy is anticipated and the data is updated
regularly by surveying all renal units 6 monthly before 2004, and
annually since then. Multivariate Cox proportional hazard models
were conducted to assess the association between cardiovascular
disease, cerebrovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, smoking status,
recipient age and obesity, and all-cause mortality among the listed
dialysis and transplant recipients. The adjusted hazard ratios for
deaths associated with the co-existing co-morbidities in transplant

recipients and listed patients on dialysis were estimated using data
from the ANZDATA Registry between 2004 and 2008. The
adjusted hazard ratios for deaths associated with the co-existing
co-morbidities in transplant recipients and patients on dialysis, and
other relevant clinical data for the model are shown in Appendix
S1.
Cost data: Appendix S2 shows all the cost inputs of the model.
Unit costs for initial and maintenance dialysis, initial (complicated
and uncomplicated), annual resources use for individuals with and
without co-morbidities such as diabetes and cardiovascular
disease, and maintenance costs for kidney transplantation were
obtained from the Australian Refined Diagnosis Related Groups
[28], the Medicare Benefits Schedule of Australia [29–32] and the
published literature. All foreign currencies were converted to the
2008 Australian dollar using the Purchasing Power Parities [33]
and the Medicare component of the Consumer Price Index (CPI).
Model outcomes
The model outcomes included the total costs and health
outcomes (expressed in life years gain) of dialysis and receiving a
deceased donor kidney transplant, and the incremental costs and
health benefits (in life years gains) of receiving a deceased donor
kidney transplant compared to remaining on dialysis. The
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of receiving a deceased
donor kidney compared to being on dialysis was calculated for
both case scenarios using the following formula:
ICER~(CostNew{CostComparator)=
(EffectivenessNew{EffectivenessComparator)
Future costs and benefits were discounted using a discount rate of
5% per annum and half-cycle corrections were employed. We
used TreeAge Pro Suite 2009 (TreeAge software, Williamstown,
MA, USA) [34] and MicrosoftH Excel to develop and analyse the
model.
Results
Table 1 shows the total and incremental health benefits (in life
years), and the total and incremental costs of waitlisting compared
to non-waitlisting among individuals with ESKD and varying co￾morbidities. The average gains in life years associated with listing
in 45-year old potential recipient with no underlying co￾morbidities compared to remaining unlisted and on dialysis were
2.41 life years, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER)
of less than $15,000/LYS.
Among those with underlying co-morbidities, the incremental
benefits of being listed varied between 0.50 life years in a 60-year
old with diabetes mellitus to 1.93 life years in a 45-year old with
cardiovascular disease. Compared to non-listing, listing an average
45-year old individual with ESKD, with and without co￾morbidities on the transplant waiting list is cost-effective, and the
ICERs are substantially below the accepted cost-effectiveness
threshold of $50,000 per life year saved (LYS) [35].
The cumulative incremental gains in life years from listing and
transplanting individuals with varying co-morbidities are shown in
Figure 2. Assuming the current waiting time on the decreased
donor list, the benefits of transplantation are not evident until 4–5
years after waitlisting. A 25-year old with no co-morbidities,
continues to gain survival benefits from being listed on the
deceased donor list over time. This compares with listing an older
recipient who is a diabetic, has a history of stroke or is a current
smoker who achieve modest gains in life years (plateaus to a
maximum of 0.7 to one life year gain) compared to non-waitlisting.
Sensitivity analysis
Scenario analysis. Age at the time of listing and the waiting￾time on the deceased donor transplant list are the most influential
variables within the model. The extent of the variability associated
with the age of listing and the waiting time on dialysis on the
incremental health outcomes of listing compared with non-listing
is shown in Figure 3. Assuming the median time to deceased donor

kidney transplant is approximately 4–5 years in Australia, the
incremental benefits of listing a 25-year old with no co-morbidities
compared to non-waitlisting are 3.84 life years, with savings of
over $16,000.The incremental health outcomes substantially
decrease to less than 1.5 life years, with incremental costs of
over $80,000 in a 65-yr old. If the waiting time of transplantation
were to decrease, the maximal gains in life expectancy from
transplantation compared to maintenance dialysis in a 25-year old
with no co-morbidities are over 5 life years, with savings over
$60,000.
Compared with maintenance dialysis, the incremental benefits
associated with transplanting a 65-year old with no co-morbidities
are gains of two extra life years, but with savings over $100,000.
The greatest change in the incremental gains in life expectancy
occurred in the ‘‘middle-age’’ population, varying between gains
of 2 extra life years under the current waiting-time and availability
of deceased organs, to over 5 extra life years if there were perfect
supply of resources and no waiting time for decreased donor
kidneys.
Probabilistic sensitivity analyses. The scatter plots shown
in Figure 4 illustrate the mean incremental costs and health
outcomes, and the uncertainties surrounding the mean parameter
estimates associated with listing a 45- and a 60-year old potential
recipient with diabetes compared to no listing. The x-axis
represents the incremental gains in life years, and the y-axis
represents the incremental costs of listing compared with non￾waitlisting [25]. The two scattered plots are located on the
northeast (NE) quadrant of the cost-effectiveness plane, with
positive incremental costs and effects, indicating that listing and
transplantation is both more effective but more costly than dialysis
in a 45- and a 60-year old with diabetes mellitus. Compared to
non-waitlisting, listing a 45-year old diabetic achieves on average,
a gain of 1.5 (60.5) extra life years compared to non-waitlisting.
Listing an older person with diabetes achieves a gain of 0.62 life
years, but varies between 0.45 to 0.80 life years compared with
non-waitlisting.
Discussion
Decision analytical modelling based upon current Australian
outcomes of dialysis and transplantation, waitlisting and trans￾planting patients with ESRD, even in the presence of identified co￾morbidities, is cost-effective and can be expected to achieve
substantial gains of between 0.5 to more than three extra life years
compared to non-waitlisting and maintenance dialysis. Given the
current waiting time for decreased donor transplantation, the

incremental benefits of transplantation compared to being on
dialysis are not apparent until more than 4–5 years after listing.
The extent of the survival benefits saved with waitlisting and
transplantation is dependent on the underlying characteristics of
the potential recipient, with the young and healthy achieving the
greatest number of absolute and incremental gains in life years.
However, the presence of the co-morbidities does not negate the
benefits of waitlisting and transplantation, and indeed among
those of older age with known cardiovascular disease and diabetes
who are deemed suitable, listing and transplantation achieves
comparable survival gains as seen in an older individual with no
co-morbidities.
Previous studies have identified factors such as aging, gender,
racial and socio-economic issues as being associated with the
inequities in access to kidney transplantation. Once accepted on
the waiting list, transplantation will achieve a gain in life
expectancy of 3–15 years compared with maintenance dialysis
[36–39], gains being dependent on donor and recipient charac￾teristics including age at transplantation [36–38,40–43]. Previous
studies, however, have not quantified the influence of the
underlying co-morbidities on the listing benefits and healthcare
expenditure compared to non-waitlisting. Using decision analytic
modelling, we have estimated the absolute and incremental gains
in survival benefits and costs between listing compared to non￾waitlisting among individuals with varying co-morbidities such as
cardiovascular disease, obesity, cerebrovascular disease, smoking
and aging.
Listing and transplanting the young and healthy individuals will
accrue the greatest number of life years over time and achieve the
greatest incremental gains in life expectancy compared to
remaining on dialysis. Younger, healthier patients are often
considered as ‘‘ideal’’ recipients who will maximally utilise the
donated organs in the context of limited resources and will most
likely achieve transplant success (i.e. better short and longer-term
patient and graft survival compared to the older and sicker
population). Whilst the absolute gains in survival among older
recipients and those with co-morbidities may never be comparable
to those observed for ‘‘ideal’’ candidates, we have shown that even
in the face of the prolonged waiting-time under the current
allocation algorithm, placing older individuals with co-morbidities
such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes mellitus on the waiting
list still achieves modest gains in survival.
Listing and transplantation affects the overall organ utilisation
and therefore has an impact on all individuals with ESRD
regardless of age and co-morbidities. Although the criteria to list
are predominantly age and co-morbidity dependent, the allocation
process is complex; and is largely dependent upon the notion of
fairness and equity, where priority is largely determined by the
duration of waiting time. Given the extent of the imbalance
between organ demand and supply, only a small proportion of the
waitlisted population will live long enough to receive a deceased
donor organ before dying on the waiting list. Age and the waiting
time on the deceased donor list are not unexpectedly, the most
important factors that influence survival benefits from transplan￾tation compared to being on dialysis. Under the optimistic
scenario of unlimited organ supplies and no waiting-time for
transplantation, transplanting the ‘‘middle to older-age’’ popula￾tion achieves substantial relative gains in life expectancy by at least

an extra 3.5 life years, compared to being on dialysis. This
somewhat counterintuitive outcome is attributable to the better
relative survival on dialysis among the younger population and the
synergistically poorer survival outcomes among those who are
older and with co-morbidities on dialysis. The annual mortality
rates of older people on the waitlisting are phenomenal, varying
between 5–10%, with the risk of death increasing exponentially
over time, and dependent predominately on age and co￾morbidities [2–4]. Our study findings support listing and
transplanting this vulnerable group of patients early who are
potentially at the greatest risk of death from cardiovascular events
on dialysis. It is inevitable and foreseeable that older patients are
more likely to die with a functioning graft than their younger
counterparts, and many would argue that the opportunity costs
(i.e. the extra life years gained from transplanting a younger person
with the same deceased organ) do not support the allocation of
‘‘better’’ quality kidneys to older patients. Recent advocates and
initiatives have suggested a change in the allocation policy to ‘‘age￾match’’ the deceased donor organs to maximise total graft life
years on a societal level [44]. Whilst the ‘‘age-match’’ debate is an
interesting and relevant issue, this discussion is beyond the scope of
our analysis.
Previous studies have shown that transplantation is good value
for money, and sometimes cost-saving [45–47]. Conversely,
dialysis is expensive, with an annual expenditure of over US$20
billion in the United States and A$ 700 million in Australia
annually and the demand for renal replacement therapy
worldwide is increasing. Contrary to findings from other economic
models, our data have suggested transplanting older individuals
with co-morbidities may not necessarily be more costly than
transplanting those without co-existent illnesses, driven predom￾inantly by the higher costs of dialysis in elderly with co-morbidities
compared to those without co-morbidities [48]. Transplanting
individuals with co-morbidities, such as diabetes requires addi￾tional resources, for example in management of diabetic-related
diseases such as retinopathy and peripheral neuropathy, but the
total cumulative costs of transplanting a diabetic are less than a
non-diabetic because they die more quickly and thus mitigated the
extra costs.
We would hope that the findings of our study will allow greater
consistency and equity for patient entry to the waiting list and
allocation of scarce transplant resources. Preferential allocation
and prioritisation of scarce organs to a specific population, in
particular the sicker and older population, would be controversial
and would raise ethical concerns by certain groups and authorities,
and does not reflect current clinical practice. Kidney transplan￾tation is a valuable medical procedure and should be offered to
those who require it equally and fairly. Given the current limited
supply of and on-going excess demand for organs, the distribution
process should be free from biases such as gender, age, ethnicity,
income, co-morbidities and socioeconomic status.
However, historical and registry data have shown that less
than 5% of those aged 65 and older are on the deceased donor
waiting list and less than 1% of the older population receive a
deceased donor kidney annually [2,49,50]. Many would argue
against allowing the younger and healthier population to wait
for ‘‘more years’’ on the transplant lists because of the
cumulative ‘‘uraemic’’ effects on potential vascular and
metabolic events, and that the greatest benefits for these
younger individuals, the community, the transplant authorities,
and the policy-makers are to transplant them early, to ensure
maximal absolute gains in graft and patient survival. The
prestige and the perceived medical excellence commonly
associated with most transplant programs have prompted
transplant authorities/clinicians to achieve optimal transplant
outcomes by ‘‘cherry-picking’’ the best candidates for trans￾plantation and not considering the overall benefits for the entire
ESKD population. Increasing the numbers of patients wait￾listed for transplantation through expanding the criteria to
include the sicker and older individuals would likely prolong
waiting times, which may adversely effect average outcomes,
shorten the overall graft and patient survival, but will
potentially extend the survival benefits to the disadvantaged,
the sickest and the most needy ESKD population.
There are a number of limitations in our study. First, our
estimates of survival gains and cost-savings are limited to patients
for whom transplant clinicians had chosen to list and then
transplant. For example, of all patients on renal replacement
therapy who are listed as having coronary artery disease on the
ANZDATA registry, it is probable that those who were
transplanted on average have lesser degrees of vascular disease
than those who were not listed for transplantation. Therefore,
the outcome probabilities used in our models, which are based
on actual outcomes, may over-estimate benefits for those with
more severe disease. Second, we have not taken into consider￾ation the benefits of living donor transplantation among those
who had been listed and waiting for deceased donor transplants,
and the harms, benefits and costs of multiple transplantations.
Third, we have not valued outcomes in quality-adjusted life
years, which may provide a more accurate assessment of both
survival and quality of life outcomes in transplant recipients.
There is, uniformly, a lack of utility-based quality of life data
among recipients with co-morbidities. The extent of the quality
of life improvement and the relative gains in quality adjusted life
years post transplant in the elderly and those with co-morbid
illnesses may be greater than those without co-existent diseases,
rendering transplantation a more attractive option for those with
co-morbidities than those without. There is therefore a need for
future research to assess the utility-based quality of life of having
co-morbidities such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease, in the
dialysis and transplant populations to ensure a more realistic
evaluation of the true impact of the survival and quality of life of
having two or more chronic illnesses. Fourth, we have not
considered donor factors, which may have a significant impact
on the graft survival and potential survival benefits from
receiving a transplant. In addition, data about the smoking
status, body weight, and stroke history within the ANZDATA
registry are incomplete, only collected at the start of the renal
replacement therapy (and therefore may not be representative of
co-morbidity status at the time of transplantation), and may be
subjected to reporting bias. We have also not allowed co￾morbidities to co-exist in the modelling and have not modelled
re-transplantation which may potentially affect the overall
survival benefits through transplantation in the ESKD popula￾tion. Finally, patients’ preferences and perspectives were not
considered in this analysis. Previous studies have reported
inconsistencies in the preferences concerning the allocation
policy of transplant organs between the community, patients and
healthcare professionals [50]. A recent systematic review of
community preferences for organ allocation found that in
addition to maximising efficiency, community preferences were
also underpinned by principles relating to social valuation, moral
deservingness, fair innings, and medical urgency [51].
While it is important to recognise and understand an
individual’s need and interests, it is also imperative to consider
the interests of the wider community, particularly in the context
of the limited organ supply and on-going demand. A better
understanding of the absolute and incremental gains in survival

and costs will help inform clinicians, decision and policy-makers
about the optimal allocation of scarce organs to achieve
maximal health gains, both from a societal and an individual’s
perspective. Excluding older and sicker patients from transplan￾tation may disadvantage the group who actually have the
greatest incremental gains in life years. The process of organ
allocation is complex and requires careful distillation and
consideration of all factors and available evidence, with the
ultimate objective to balance the two competing interests of
maximising efficiency and maintaining social justice in the
distribution of limited resources.
