Abstract 
Background: Atypical haemolytic uraemic syndrome (aHUS) presents similarly to 
thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), and other causes or conditions with thrombotic 
microangiopathy (TMA) such as DIC or sepsis. Similarity in clinical presentation may hinder 
diagnosis and optimal treatment selection in the urgent setting in the ICU. However, there is 
currently no consensus on the diagnosis or treatment of aHUS for ICU specialists. This 
review aims to summarise available data on the diagnosis and treatment strategies of aHUS in 
the ICU in order to enhance the understanding of aHUS diagnosis and outcomes in patients 
managed in the ICU. 
Methods: A review of the recent literature (January 2009 – March 2016) was performed to 
select the most relevant articles for ICU physicians. 
Results: Based on the paucity of adult aHUS cases overall and within the ICU, no specific 
recommendations could be formally graded for the critical care setting. However, the expert 
panel recognises a core set of skills required by intensivists for diagnosing and managing 
patients with aHUS: recognising thrombotic microangiopathies, differentiating aHUS from 
related conditions, recognising involvement of other organ systems, understanding the 
pathophysiology of aHUS, knowing the diagnostic workup and relevant outcomes in 
critically ill aHUS patients, and knowing the standard of care for patients with aHUS based 
on available data and guidelines. 
Conclusions: Managing critically ill patients with aHUS requires basic skills that, in the 
absence of sufficient data from patients treated within the ICU, can be gleaned from an 
increasingly relevant literature outside the ICU. More data on critically ill patients with aHUS 
are needed to validate these conclusions within the ICU setting.

INTRODUCTION 
Thrombotic microangiopathies (TMAs) are a group of disorders characterised by 
thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia and organ dysfunction in which 
ischaemic organ injury can occur to the brain, kidneys, heart, pancreas, liver, lungs, eyes and 
skin. Conditions with TMAs include the haemolytic uraemic syndromes (HUSs) and 
thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), as well as a number of differential diagnoses 
that must also be excluded (Figure 1). These conditions have a similar clinical presentation of 
consumptive thrombocytopenia, mechanical haemolysis and organ failure, although with 
distinct causes, and are typically associated with thickening and inflammation of arterioles 
and capillaries, detachment and swelling of endothelial cells, subendothelial widening, 
accumulation of proteins and cellular debris, or platelet thrombi that obstruct the vascular 
lumen.1,2
 
Herein, we will focus on one of these conditions, atypical haemolytic uraemic syndrome 
(aHUS). aHUS is a rare but life-threatening condition that affects both children and adults. It 
accounts for approximately 10% of cases of HUS in children but the majority of HUS cases 
in adults.3
 The annual incidence of aHUS is thought to be around 1–2 per million in adults,4
although epidemiological data are limited.5
 aHUS is distinct from typical, or diarrhoea 
associated-HUS, now commonly called STEC-HUS, which is typically caused by shiga-toxin 
due to bacterial infection and often associated with bloody diarrhoea. In most cases, aHUS is 
caused by the uncontrolled activation of the complement system, which leads to platelet, 
leucocyte and endothelial cell activation and TMA,1,6-8 ultimately causing thrombosis and 
organ dysfunction.8,9 Accordingly, it may be unmasked by conditions with enhanced 
complement activation, such as systemic lupus erythematosus, pregnancy, malignant 
hypertension, and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

Genetic abnormalities have been found in approximately 50–70% of patients with aHUS,4,10
and a wide variety of mutations are associated with the condition.4,8 Although gene mutations 
increase the risk of aHUS, they may not be sufficient to cause overt symptoms without 
additional environmental triggers. These include infections, pregnancy, certain medications, 
malignancy, sepsis, bone marrow transplantation and connective tissue disorders.2,9,11
Consequently, genetic testing is currently not useful for the acute diagnosis of aHUS, e.g. in 
the intensive care unit (ICU) setting, but it can provide diagnostic confirmation, prognostic 
value and information on long-term treatment. Furthermore, owing to the severe nature of the 
condition, the time delay in obtaining genetic results is not consistent with the need for rapid 
initiation of therapy. In the absence of any fast, specific diagnostic tests for aHUS, the 
condition can only be diagnosed after exclusion of TTP12 and related TMAs. 
Previously, aHUS and TTP have been managed in the same way, as the conditions are 
difficult to differentiate and only one treatment option, plasma therapy (plasma infusion or 
plasma exchange), was available.1,4 The benefits of plasma exchange, although not evaluated 
in prospective studies, include the removal of pathological substances from the blood and the 
replacement of deficient plasma components.13 However, although plasma therapy has 
improved outcomes considerably in TTP, reducing the mortality rate from 90% to 10–20%,14
more than 50% of patients with aHUS proceed to end stage renal disease or death despite 
plasma therapy.8,12 Consequently, specific, urgent and interdisciplinary management is 
paramount in the treatment of patients with aHUS owing to both the severity of the illness 
and the potential development of irreversible complications of organ involvement.1
Eculizumab, approved in 2011, is the first treatment for aHUS with proven efficacy and 
safety in prospective clinical trials.6

and C5b;15 evidence suggests that early initiation can improve renal and non-renal 
recovery.16,17
 
In many cases, the ICU is the only clinical environment in which such specialised, urgent 
care can be effectively provided at any time. Based on the experience of the panel, physicians 
in the ICU see an average of three patients with TMA per year, many of whom are not 
diagnosed at the time of admission. Although treatment guidelines for aHUS are available for 
nephrology,14,18-20 there is currently no consensus on the diagnosis or treatment of aHUS for 
ICU specialists. This review aims to summarise available data on the diagnosis and treatment 
of aHUS in the ICU with the goal of enhancing the understanding of aHUS diagnosis and 
outcomes in patients managed in the ICU.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS 
The need for this manuscript was identified by a multidisciplinary multinational expert panel 
of 11 members (nine intensive care physicians and two haematologists), who met in 
September 2015 to define unmet needs and skill priorities for ICU clinicians managing 
critically ill patients with aHUS and to evaluate existing recommendations outside critical 
care. A literature search was conducted in the National Library of Medicine database 
(PubMed; www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/) looking for articles published between January 
2009 and March 2016, using the search terms “atypical haemolytic uraemic syndrome” or 
“atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome” or “diarrhoea negative haemolytic uraemic syndrome” 
or “diarrhea negative hemolytic uremic syndrome” or “aHUS” or “D-HUS” with search 
filters of “humans” and “English language”. Additional relevant articles were also included 
from internet searches using the same search terms. Articles were reviewed manually for 
relevance by the authors; studies concerning both transplant and native kidney patients with 
aHUS were permitted in this study, as well as systematic literature reviews and specialist 
review articles. In total, 539 articles were identified, of which 56 were considered relevant 
(included diagnosis and/or treatment of adult patients with aHUS).

DIAGNOSIS OF PATIENTS WITH aHUS 
Diagnosis of aHUS typically commences with the broad diagnosis of TMA (Figure 2, Table 
1) and implicates the involvement of not only the ICU physician but also other specialists, 
notably haematologists and nephrologists. Clinical suspicion of a TMA is based on clinical 
findings, including microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia, thrombocytopenia, low 
haptoglobin, elevated lactate dehydrogenase, elevated reticulocytes, fragmented red cells and 
schistocytes on peripheral blood smear. Acute kidney injury is common in aHUS, but other 
organ involvement, including cardiac, gastrointestinal or neurological damage, may be 
present and can dominate the clinical picture1,5,21-24 (Figure 2, Table 1). Once a suspicion of 
TMA has been established, further investigations, including a full patient medical and family 
history, are required to exclude other potential causes of TMA, including TTP, shiga-toxin 
associated HUS (STEC-HUS) or TMA as a transient manifestation of another condition (e.g. 
malignancy or autoimmune disease) or adverse drug effect, although identification of one of 
these modulating factors does not preclude development of aHUS in individuals with a 
genetic predisposition. Additionally, an HIV test and a pregnancy test in women of child￾bearing age should be performed to account for these potential triggers.25
 
Differential diagnosis 
Distinguishing aHUS from TTP 
ADAMTS13 activity 
The most critical and urgent differential diagnosis is to differentiate TTP from aHUS owing 
to the urgency of specific treatment. Testing for ADAMTS13 (a disintegrin and 
metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs 13) activity is recommended to differentiate 
between TTP and aHUS,23 and sampling must take place prior to administration of plasma 
therapy. ADAMTS13 deficiency is characteristic of TTP, with levels < 10% widely

considered to be diagnostic for the condition.12,14,23,26-29 ADAMTS13, also known as vWF 
cleavage protease, acts by cleavage of vWF into smaller, less thrombotic fragments, thereby 
reducing platelet aggregation. Conversely, in TTP, reduced activity of ADAMTS13 results in 
platelet hyperadhesiveness and clumping within the microvasculature.23,30
Somewhat reduced ADAMTS13-activity levels (> 10% of normal) may also occur in aHUS, 
but such levels are sufficient to exclude TTP. While results from the ADAMTS13 assay are 
typically available within a few hours when the assay is established in the local laboratory, 
they may take some days when the sample has to be shipped, meaning that treatment 
decisions may need to be made prior to receiving the results of the test. If ADAMTS13 tests 
are not available within a few hours, a diagnostic algorithm developed by Coppo et al. – in 
which TTP is suggested by low platelet count (< 30 × 109
/L), mildly elevated serum 
creatinine (≤ 200 µmol/L) and detectable antinuclear antibodies – could help form an initial 
differential diagnosis.31 In the interim, until TTP has been excluded, patients should receive 
plasma exchange. 
Organ involvement 
The presence of associated organ involvement may be included within the diagnostic workup 
to provide evidence for differentiation of aHUS from TTP, but it is not conclusive. Renal 
impairment is the most common complication in aHUS (Figure 3), but renal function may be 
preserved in up to 20% of cases. Acute kidney injury may be seen in TTP but is typically 
reversible with therapy32 The need for renal support, such as haemodialysis, is not a common 
feature of TTP, but it can be seen in progressive disease with multiorgan involvement. 
Neurological signs (e.g. confusion, focal cerebral abnormalities and seizures) and 
cardiovascular signs (e.g. cardiomyopathy, myocardial infarction, myocarditis and heart 
failure) occur in 10–48% and 10% of aHUS cases, respectively;9
 however, these signs tend to 

MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED

be more frequent in TTP.14,33 Tsai34 reported that complications of abnormal vascular 
permeability (including brain oedema, pleural or pericardial effusions, pulmonary oedema 
from oliguria or cardiac insufficiency, and ascites) may be used to differentiate TTP from 
aHUS as they are thought to occur rarely in TTP without comorbidity. aHUS is also 
occasionally associated with large artery obstruction.35 Arterial hypertension may be present, 
while pulmonary involvement is frequent in untreated aHUS but rarely associated with other 
TMAs.23
 
Complement protein level testing 
Complement factor testing for complement components 3 and 4 (C3 and C4, respectively), 
complement factor H, complement factor I and antibodies against complement components 
can detect protein deficiencies due to genetic mutations but cannot differentiate between 
normal protein and normal levels of functionally ineffective protein.28 C4 levels are usually 
normal, but C3 levels are low (normal range 88–252 mg/dL in males and 88–206 mg/dL in 
females36) in up to 40% of patients with aHUS.22,37 Many functional complement tests are 
very sensitive to preanalytical errors. Therefore, complement testing may help to confirm 
suspected aHUS, but it is not useful as a diagnostic test by itself. 
Genetic testing 
Genetic abnormalities in the complement system proteins have been documented,38 and 
assessment of these mutations may be used to confirm a diagnosis. Mutations in complement 
factor H account for ~25% of aHUS cases, membrane cofactor protein for ~10%, 
complement factor I for 5–10% and thrombomodulin for up to 5% of cases,39 although no 
known mutations are identified in 30–50% of patients.4,10 Other genetic variants include gain￾of-function mutations in the genes coding for complement factor B and C3, and anti￾complement factor H antibodies associated with homozygous complement factor H-related

1–3 deletion.4,8 The parameters associated with clinical aHUS onset are yet to be wholly 
elucidated. The current hypothesis is a two-hit model: 1) pre-existing genetic susceptibility 
factors that are capable of stimulating endothelial cell activation/damage and/or platelet 
aggregation; and 2) modulating factors, encompassing a variety of conditions that can be 
infectious, inflammatory or related to pregnancy, drugs or stress and are linked 
epidemiologically to both TTP and aHUS.23 Mutations confer a genetic predisposition, so 
although a positive result is compatible with the diagnosis, a negative result does not 
necessarily exclude aHUS. Additionally, the results from such tests may take weeks, which is 
not compatible with the urgent care setting of the ICU, where rapid treatment decisions and 
administration of urgent therapy are necessities.

Distinguishing aHUS from STEC-HUS and pneumococcal HUS 
Culture-based assays (serology or polymerase chain reaction, PCR) for Shiga toxin￾producing Escherichia coli (STEC), using a stool or rectal swab, in patients with diarrhoea 
can diagnose STEC-HUS and clearly differentiate it from aHUS. Although E. coli is not the 
only source of Shiga toxin, STEC-HUS, previously referred to as typical HUS or diarrhoea￾positive HUS, is the most commonly used terminology today and is used here to refer to this 
subset of HUS. The presence of diarrhoea alone has been used in the past to differentiate 
between the conditions; however, this cannot be relied upon as up to one-third of aHUS cases 
also involve diarrhoea, so the presence of Shiga toxin must be analysed in patients with 
diarrhoea.23 Pneumococcal HUS is linked to the evidence of invasive pneumococcal 
infection. Bacterial culture from sterile bodily fluids is required for confirmation of 
pneumococcal infection and pneumococcal HUS is – in contrast to aHUS and TTP – often 
associated with a positive Coombs test.25

Further tests to consider in the workup of a patient presenting with TMA
Patients presenting with TMA may require further testing to rule out additional associated 
conditions. Disseminated intravascular coagulopathy and sepsis may present with TMA 
features but can be ruled out by measuring coagulation parameters, which are all normal in 
aHUS and TTP.14 Pregnancy can result in complications of TMAs; TMA often leads to fetal 
death and TMA therapy may have an influence on the fetus. Therefore, a pregnancy test 
should be performed in women of childbearing age.40 Viral infections, including HIV, 
hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, cytomegalovirus and Epstein–Barr virus, can also cause 
TMA and so must be investigated.1,40 Serology tests, such as antinuclear antibodies and anti￾DNA-antibodies to neutrophil cytoplasmic antigens, must be considered to rule out systemic 
diseases,1
 and basal organ testing, including a brain and lung CT scan, troponin levels, blood 
glucose levels and serum lipase levels, is also recommended.40 While a negative direct 
antiglobulin test (Coombs test) can confirm TMA, a positive result may be indicative of 
autoimmune haemolytic anaemia, Evans syndrome (when in conjunction with immune￾mediated thrombocytopenia) or pneumococcal HUS. A full medical history should be 
acquired to determine underlying conditions, such as malignancies, and drug- or medication￾associated TMAs,1,40 for example heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT).
41 Family history 
of TMA or renal injury should also be evaluated considering the important genetic 
component of aHUS.

Diagnosing aHUS in the ICU setting 
Data on the clinical presentation and diagnosis of aHUS, particularly in the ICU setting, are 
limited by the small number of patients with this condition reported in ICU literature28
Furthermore, findings relating to aHUS are mostly published in nephrology and haematology 
journals, with limited reach to the ICU specialist. An industry-supported global aHUS 
registry was initiated in 2012, and data on the baseline demographics and clinical 
characteristics of 516 patients with aHUS were recently published.42
 
A review of the available case studies relevant to the ICU setting revealed that the initial 
diagnostic workup was similar for all patients, regardless of the presenting symptoms. It is 
notable that a variety of approaches were taken for progression beyond the TMA diagnosis, 
with most patients receiving initial plasma exchange while undergoing further investigations, 
including ADAMTS13 activity, Shiga toxin testing, kidney biopsy if feasible in critically ill 
patients and genetic screening. Together, information from these case studies can inform an 
appropriate workup relevant to patients presenting with aHUS symptoms within the ICU. A 
summary of the key considerations for the differential diagnosis of aHUS in the ICU setting 
is presented in Table 1.

TREATMENT OF PATIENTS WITH aHUS IN THE ICU 
Knowing the standard of care for patients with aHUS, based on available guidelines and 
expert suggestions on best practice in the treatment of critically ill patients with aHUS, is a 
skill we consider necessary within the ICU. No published guidelines or recommendations 
focus on the management of patients in the ICU; however, there are no differences in 
treatment requirements between settings, and published treatment guidelines from other 
clinical settings apply. 
Immediate ICU management 
The critical nature of acute TMA means that a high proportion of patients may be admitted to 
the ICU at presentation. Owing to the severity of the progression of aHUS and other TMAs, a 
suspected diagnosis should be treated as a medical emergency, and initial supportive 
measures should be introduced with urgency. The British Committee for Standards in 
Haematology guidelines suggest that appropriate treatment should be initiated within 4–8 h 
from diagnosis, as delays are associated with increased morbidity and mortality.14
 
While plasma exchange has greatly improved the survival of patients with TTP,12 it is not 
considered the most effective therapy for aHUS as the majority of patients will die or require 
long-term renal replacement therapy despite this treatment.4,12,37 However, owing to the 
difficulty in differentiating between aHUS and TTP, initiation of plasma exchange is often 
necessary while laboratory results are being determined.43 Exceptions include patients with 
metastatic cancer with bone marrow involvement for which plasma exchange would not 
improve the situation. Plasma exchange requires careful monitoring of organ function, 
platelet counts and the presence of infections, which can arise from central venous lines and

other sources related to medical interventions. Platelet concentrates should be avoided during 
initial therapy as they may aggravate platelet aggregation.40
 
Specific management of aHUS 
Once ADAMTS13 is proven detectable (> 10% activity) the probability of a diagnosis of 
aHUS is high, and more specific therapy can be applied. This can be confirmed with a 
negative test for STEC, once laboratory results have been received. Treatment options for 
aHUS were limited to plasma exchange, dialysis for renal failure and kidney transplantation 
until 2011, when eculizumab, a recombinant, humanised, monoclonal antibody was approved 
for use in patients with aHUS.12,43 Eculizumab selectively targets and inhibits the terminal 
complement protein C5, thereby inhibiting the terminal complement activation.44
 
Eculizumab has been demonstrated to be effective and well tolerated in four prospective 
phase II trials in patients with aHUS.44-47 These trials were however not carried out in the 
critical care setting. In these trials, terminal complement inhibition with eculizumab was 
associated with inhibition of further TMA progression, increased platelet count and 
significant improvement in renal function, including discontinuation of dialysis in 80% of 
patients on dialysis at initiation of treatment and prevention of recurrence after 
transplantation.6
 Based on these results, eculizumab was included in a 2015 update to the 
clinical guidelines1
 and in an international consensus for the treatment of aHUS in children in 
2016.19 In addition, a number of reviews on the management of patients with aHUS 
recommend the use of eculizumab.14,20,25,28,43,48,49 However, eculizumab is contraindicated in 
patients with unresolved Neisserial infection, e.g. Neisseria meningitidis, and in unvaccinated 
individuals owing to the role of terminal complement in the prevention of Neisserial 
infection, unless the benefits of treatment outweigh the risks of contracting the infection.50

Type B should be administered at least 2 weeks prior to initiation of eculizumab. If 
eculizumab treatment needs to be initiated immediately in a critically ill patient, prophylactic 
antibiotics should be given at the start of therapy and maintained for a minimum of 2 weeks51
or as specified in individual country guidelines. 
Management should also include supportive measures aimed at managing the risks and 
consequences of aHUS, such as hypertension, anaemia, thrombocytopenia, acute renal failure 
and infections, particularly in patients not receiving specific targeted treatment, e.g. 
eculizumab. Hypertension is common in patients presenting with aHUS and should be 
managed with appropriate medications (angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or 
angiotensin receptor blockers), while red blood cell transfusion may be considered for 
patients with anaemia, noting that platelet infusions are contraindicated unless the patient is 
bleeding or at high risk of haemorrhage (i.e. at-risk surgical procedure) or severely 
thrombocytopenic (platelet count <30,000/mm3
). Due to the risk of relapse triggered by 
infections, physicians should be vigilant for signs of infection, initiating appropriate 
treatment where necessary.1,3

OUTCOMES OF CRITICALLY ILL PATIENTS WITH aHUS 
Data regarding the outcomes of adult patients with aHUS are sparse owing to the rarity of the 
disorder, and data relating to the treatment of such patients in the ICU are rarer still. 
However, existing studies agree that the prognosis of patients with aHUS is poor, with around 
50% of patients requiring dialysis, suffering permanent kidney damage or dying within 1 year 
of first occurrence despite plasma therapy.4,10,52 In an Italian cohort, mortality after the first 
episode was 2% in adults; this was markedly lower than the 12% mortality rate reported in 
children in the same study. Furthermore, 32% of survivors never recovered renal function.10
Despite plasma therapy, at 3–5 years after onset, 67% of adults with aHUS had either died or 
reached end-stage renal failure.10
Kidney transplantation, while cited as a treatment option for aHUS, was, in fact, rarely 
considered because of an overall risk of recurrence after transplantation of 50%, with a high 
risk of graft rejection (up to 100%) in those with recurrence.3
 The risk of post-transplant 
recurrence varies according to the genetic mutation present and ranges from 0 to 30% in 
patients with membrane cofactor protein mutation, 40 to 70% with C3 mutation, 45 to 80% 
with complement factor I mutation, 75 to 90% with complement factor H mutation and up to 
100% with complement factor B mutation.3,10,17,53 Owing to the high risk of graft rejection, 
living-donor transplantation is not recommended, particularly from living relations owing to 
the increased risk of the donor subsequently developing aHUS.3
 
Since the approval of eculizumab, outcomes of patients with aHUS have improved 
significantly, causing a paradigm shift in the management of these patients.19,47 Notably, 80% 
of patients on dialysis at baseline could discontinue dialysis with eculizumab.25,45 A 2-year 
extension of a phase II study with eculizumab found that haematological normalisation was 
achieved by 13 of 17 patients after 26 weeks and by 15 patients at both years 1 and 2. In a

Conclusion 
This review is the first of its kind to outline the standard of care in critically ill adult patients 
with aHUS in the ICU. aHUS is defined by thrombocytopenia, non-immune haemolytic 
anaemia and acute kidney injury, and often presents with associated organ dysfunction. 
Although TTP is fairly well recognised by critical care specialists, aHUS remains a 
diagnostic challenge owing to the rarity of the disease. As there are no specific tests and 
aHUS is diagnosed by exclusion, diagnosis should be oriented towards aHUS if disseminated 
intravascular coagulation is ruled out, STEC test is negative and plasma activity of 
ADAMTS13 is > 10%. For optimal patient outcomes, early recognition and appropriate 
treatment are critical to reduce the risk of irreversible organ damage or death. This review 
suggests initiating plasma therapy within 4–8 h of TMA diagnosis and switching to 
eculizumab treatment as early as possible after a confirmed aHUS diagnosis (ADAMTS13 > 
10% and a negative STEC test).

bleeding risk. 
This is not an exhaustive list, but a suggestion. Further tests for conditions that can mimic TMA, such as 
malaria, babesiosis and vitamin deficiency, may be warranted.

Table 2. Key considerations for differential diagnosis of aHUS in the ICU. 
1. Microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia, thrombocytopenia and organ impairment 
should be recognised as being suggestive of TMA 
2. A full medical history should be taken to exclude or identify other causes, e.g. 
previous TMA episodes, pregnancy, prior malignancies, drug use, etc. 
3. Disseminated intravascular coagulation and sepsis should be ruled out by clinical 
picture, microbiological testing and assessment of coagulation screen 
4. TTP and STEC-HUS should be ruled out with ADAMTS13 activity (before 
initiation of plasma therapy) and Shiga tests; if ADAMTS13-activity test is not 
available, the Coppo algorithm31 to assess serum creatinine and platelet count may 
be considered 
5. If TMA persists upon specific treatment of associated condition (Fig 1), differential 
diagnosis for aHUS should be considered

Table 3. Recommendations for management of adult patients with suspected aHUS in the 
ICU. 
1. Obtain adequate diagnostic samples before plasma therapy 
2. Make use of multidisciplinary care, including nephrologists and haematologists 
3. Initiate plasma therapy within 4–8 h of admission or diagnosis of TMA. For 
patients with an initial presentation of TMA, switch to eculizumab as soon as a 
diagnosis of aHUS is confirmed (ADAMTS13 > 10% and STEC negative); for 
patients with a history of previous aHUS, initiate eculizumab immediately upon 
admission to the ICU 
4. Careful ICU monitoring should be offered as organ dysfunction may appear or 
worsen until remission 
5. Owing to the increased risk of Neisseria meningitidis infection with eculizumab 
treatment, patients should be vaccinated against serotypes A, C, Y and W135 and 
subtype B 2 weeks before eculizumab is initiated; unvaccinated individuals should 
receive prophylactic antibiotics upon eculizumab initiation until at least 2 weeks 
after Neisseria meningitidis vaccination (please refer to country-specific 
guidelines).
