INTRODUCTION
C hronic kidney disease (CKD) is defined as 
functional abnormalities of the kidney lasting 
longer than 3 months, with or without reduced 
glomerular filtration rate. It can also be defined by the 
presence of urinary albumin with an excretion rate 
higher than 300 mg/24 h or in a ratio of more than 
200mg of albumin to 1 g of creatinine.[1] The prevalence 
of CKD, in India ranges from 0.79% to 1.4%.[2]
Hyperparathyroidism secondary to CKD is an 
overproduction of parathyroid hormone (PTH) caused 
by several changes that occur in bone and mineral 
metabolism as a result of decreased kidney function. 
The first change that usually occurs with declining kidney 
function involves the deficiency of activated vitamin D 
and an increase in phosphorus excretion by the 
remaining functional nephrons. Both of these changes 
stimulate an increase in PTH synthesis and secretion. 
Secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) develops early 
in the course of the disease before dialysis initiation. 
Unfortunately, it is often unrecognized and inadequately 
treated in patients with early stages of kidney disease 
when therapy would have greater benefits.
Anemia has been recognized as a possible 
complication of primary hyperparathyroidism.[3] Since 
hyperparathyroidism can induce anemia in patients 
with normal kidney function, SHPT due to CKD 
may also have an unfavorable influence on anemia 
of uremic patients. There is also indirect evidence of 
restoration of the hematocrit after parathyroidectomy 
in uremic patients due to restoration of bone

ABSTRACT
Purpose: Secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) is one of the less recognized reasons of anemia in chronic kidney 
disease (CKD). In this study, we evaluated the role of SHPT as a cause of anemia and correlation of intact parathyroid 
hormone (iPTH) and hemoglobin (Hb) level in hemodialysis (HD) patients.
Methods: This cross‑sectional study was carried out in 63 individuals admitted in HD unit of the institute. Serum samples 
were collected and urea, creatinine, Hb, ferritin and iPTH levels were measured. Statistical analysis was carried out 
using the SPSS software (IBM, NY, USA).
Results: Mean ± standard deviation for serum urea, creatinine, Hb, ferritin and intact PTH were 177 ± 15.52, 
15.16 ± 2.28 mg/dl, 7.03 ± 2.26 g/dl, 654.7 ± 563.4 ng/ml, 539.18 ± 493.59 pg/ml respectively. A reverse correlation 
was found between intact PTH and Hb level. 
Conclusions: A variety of postulated pathophysiological mechanisms linking SHPT and anemia in CKD are discussed. 
An efficient control of parathyroid hormone hypersecretion may be required to achieve a better management of anemia 
in HD patients.

marrow space after operation and rise of immunoreactive 
erythropoietin (EPO) serum concentrations.[4]
Factors that may be responsible for anemia in CKD 
are blood loss, shortened red cell life span, vitamin 
deficiencies, EPO deficiency, iron deficiency, infection 
and inflammation. Among these, EPO deficiency is 
considered as the most important cause.[5] The introduction 
of recombinant human erythropoietin (rhEPO) therapy 
in the early 1990s for treatment of anemia of patients 
undergoing hemodialysis (HD) has led to a significant 
reduction in anemia and to an improvement in patients’ 
quality‑of‑life.[5] However, there is a significant variability 
among HD patients in the sensitivity to rhEPO. Moreover, 
around 5‑10% of the patients show a marked resistance to 
rhEPO therapy.[6‑10] The European Best Practice Guidelines 
define “resistance to rhEPO therapy” as a failure to achieve 
target hemoglobin (Hb) levels (between 11 and 12 g/dl) 
with maintained doses of rhEPO.[6] There are many causes 
of this variability of resistance to rhEPO therapy. One of 
the possible reasons may be SHPT. Hemodialysis patients 
with SHPT, usually associated with osteitis fibrosa on bone 
histology, show considerable resistance to EPO, which is 
partly because of replacement of the bone marrow by 
fibrous tissue.
In this study, we have analyzed the effect of SHPT in 
aggravating the anemia and correlation of intact parathyroid 
hormone (iPTH) and Hb level if there is any, in HD patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
This cross‑sectional study was carried out in 63 patients 
admitted in HD unit of North East Indira Gandhi Institute 
of Health and Medical Science. Serum urea, creatinine, Hb, 
ferritin and intact PTH were measured. Patients taking 
angiotensin‑converting enzyme‑inhibitors, non‑steroidal 
anti‑inflammatory drugs and those having external blood 
loss were excluded. Baseline data of patients like age and 
sex were recorded. Institutional review was not necessary 
as it was a retrospective study.
All blood specimens were drawn as pre‑dialysis. Blood 
chemistry analysis was carried out with the Beckman coulter 
auto‑analyzer AU2700. Serum ferritin and intact PTH 
were assayed by chemiluminescence method (Access2, 
Beckman coulter).
A database was constructed on Microsoft Excel 2007 and 
statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS software 
version 20.0 (IBM, NY, USA).
RESULTS
In our study, comprising 63patients 31 (49.2%) were men and 
32 (50.8%) were women with nearly equal sex distribution. 
17 patients (27.0%) were in the age group 20‑40 years, 
33 (52.4%) were in the age group 40‑60 years and 13 (20.6%) 
were in the age group 60‑80 years. Mean±standard deviation 
for serum urea, creatinine, Hb, ferritin and iPTH were 
177 ± 15.52 mg/dl, 15.16 ± 2.28 mg/dl, 7.03 ± 2.26 g/dl, 
654.7 ± 563.4 ng/ml, 539.18 ± 493.59 pg/ml respectively.
Three patients(4.8%) had normal iPTH levels (12‑88 pg/ml) 
and rest of patients had raised levels of iPTH (95.2%). With 
respect to ferritin, 23 (36.5%) had normal ferritin level of 
11‑336 ng/ml; 40 (63.5%) had a raised levels of ferritin. 
All patients had Hb level of <13 g/dl.
No significant association was observed between age 
and iPTH (Chi‑square = 6.967, df = 4), age and Hb 
levels (Chi‑square = 2.027, df = 6, P > 0.05) and 
between age and ferritin levels. (Chi‑square = 8.361, 
df = 4, P > 0.05). Furthermore, no significant 
association was observed between ferritin and iPTH 
levels. (Chi‑square = 4.550, df = 4, P > 0.05) and ferritin 
and Hb levels (Chi‑square = 4.766, df = 6, P > 0.05). 
A significant association was however observed between 
PTH and Hb levels (Chi‑square = 26.942, df = 6,
P < 0.001).
Similarly, bivariate analysis was carried out including serum 
PTH, Hb, Age and ferritin did not show any relationship 
between these parameters except Hb and PTH i.e., a 
Pearson’s correlation of −0.545 and covariance −0.609.3, 
which were statistically significant.
A reverse correlation was found between intact PTH and 
Hb level (r = −0.545), which indicates that the variables 
iPTH and Hb level are inversely proportional to each 
other [Figure 1]. More importantly, no correlation was 
observed between iPTH and ferritin (r = 0.0709) indicating 
that anemia is not due to depleted iron stores.
DISCUSSION
The development of SHPT as well as anemia is a common 
complication of CKD. The World Health Organization 
has defined anemia as an Hb concentration lower than 
13.0 g/dl in men and post‑menopausal women and less 
than 12.0 g/dl in other women. In this study, a significant 
association was found between PTH and Hb level, which 
is consistent with the findings of Baradaran and Nasri,[11]
Sliem et al.
[12] and Trovato et al.
[13] A reverse correlation

Journal of Laboratory Physicians / Jan-Jun 2013 / Vol-5 / Issue-1 53
was found between PTH and Hb level. Possible causes 
of low Hb level or anemia due to SHPT may be because 
of increased bone marrow fibrosis, which may lead to 
decreased erythropoietin and increased resistance to 
EPO.[14] Erythropoietin cells express calcitriol receptors, 
which induces proliferation and maturation of erythroid 
progenitor cells. Therefore, deficiency of calcitriol, a 
cause of hyperparathyroidism may impair erythropoiesis. 
There are also some studies, which support an increase 
in erythrocyte osmotic fragility due to high concentration 
of PTH in patients on dialysis, leading to low Hb level.[15]
Management of SHPT is a challenge frequently encountered 
in the patients with CKD. Down‑regulation of the 
parathyroid vitamin D and calcium‑sensing receptors 
are the critical steps that lead to abnormalities in mineral 
metabolism: High phosphate, low calcium and vitamin 
D deficiency. These imbalances result in parathyroid 
hyperplasia leading to SHPT and elevated serum calcium, 
phosphorus, calcium‑phosphorus product. As a result of 
these, relative risk of mortality increases.[16]
An efficient control of PTH hypersecretion is therefore 
required to achieve a better management of anemia as well 
as mineral metabolism in HD patients.
The medical management of SHPT in patients with 
CKD principally involves dietary changes, the use of 
the combination of phosphate binders, active vitamin D 
analogs and/or calcimimetics(which increase the sensitivity 
of the calcium sensing receptors to calcium).[16] In addition, 
they need treatment of underlying conditions including 
hypertension, cardiac ailments and diabetes.
Patients with CKD need special diet with restriction 
of salt, potassium, phosphorous and other electrolytes. 
Protein restriction while getting enough calories to 
prevent weight loss is also needed. However, dietary 
recommendations may change over time as patient’s 
disease progresses. For example, during dialysis protein 
requirement increases hence patient needs extra proteins. 
Calcium supplementation is necessary to prevent loss of 
calcium from bones; however, dairy products must be 
avoided they also contain high amount of phosphorus. 
Restricting fluids, common salt and fruits containing high 
potassium is also needed to maintain adequate fluid and 
electrolyte balance. Patient also needs extra iron to prevent 
anemia, which can occur because of various reasons 
already mentioned.[17‑20]
More wider and detailed studies are necessary to confirm 
the findings and to explain the mechanisms underlying the 
improvement in anemia after medical or surgical treatment 
of SHPT.
