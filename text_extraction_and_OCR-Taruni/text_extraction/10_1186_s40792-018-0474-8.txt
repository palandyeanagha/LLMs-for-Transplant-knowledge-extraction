Abstract
Background: Surgeons sometimes must plan pancreatoduodenectomy (PD) for patients with a variant common
hepatic artery (CHA) branching from the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) penetrating the pancreatic parenchyma,
known as a transpancreatic CHA (tp-CHA).
Case presentation: A 67-year-old man was admitted to our hospital because of liver dysfunction. A duodenal
tumor was identified by gastrointestinal endoscopy, and a biopsy revealed a neuroendocrine tumor. Computed
tomography showed multiple metastases in the left three sections of the liver. As an anatomical variant, the CHA
branched from the SMA and passed through the parenchyma of the pancreatic head, and all hepatic arteries
branched from the CHA. Furthermore, the arcade between the left and right gastric artery (RGA) was detected, and
the RGA branched from the root of the left hepatic artery. PD and left trisectionectomy of the liver were performed.
The tp-CHA was resected with the pancreatic head, and the gastric arterial arcade was preserved to maintain the
right posterior hepatic arterial flow. Postoperatively, there were no signs of hepatic ischemia.
Conclusions: When planning PD, including hepatopancreatoduodenectomy, for patients with a tp-CHA, surgeons
should simulate various situations for maintaining the hepatic arterial flow. The preservation of the gastric arterial
arcade is an option for maintaining the hepatic arterial flow to avoid arterial reconstruction.

Background
The common trunk formed by the common hepatic artery
(CHA) and the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) is re￾ferred to as the hepatomesenteric trunk; this is only found
in 1.5–2.3% of the population [1, 2]. Among such individ￾uals, only a few patients have the CHA passing fully
through the pancreatic parenchyma (transpancreatic CHA
[tp-CHA]) [1, 3]. During pancreatoduodenectomy (PD)
(including hepatopancreatoduodenectomy [HPD]) for pa￾tients with tp-CHA, it is necessary to consider the surgical
procedure to maintain the hepatic arterial flow, including
the preservation of the CHA separating from pancreatic
parenchyma [4], reconstruction of the hepatic artery after
combined resection of tp-CHA [4, 5], and the preservation
of the collateral circulation after combined resection of
tp-CHA [2], in order to avoid hepatic ischemia and lethal
complications [4, 6].
We herein report a case of duodenal neuroendocrine
tumor (NET) with multiple liver metastases for a patient
with a tp-CHA. The patient was successfully treated
with PD and left trisectionectomy with caudate lobec￾tomy combined resection of the tp-CHA and preserva￾tion of the gastric arterial arcade in order to maintain
the hepatic arterial flow.
Case presentation
A 67-year-old man was admitted to our hospital because
of liver dysfunction during a screening examination. En￾hanced abdominal computed tomography (CT) revealed
a hypervascular mass of 35 mm in diameter in the de￾scending portion of the duodenum (Fig. 1a), and the left
three sections of the liver were occupied by multiple cys￾tic tumors with contrast enhancement of the cystic wall,
13 cm in diameter (Fig. 1b). A duodenal tumor was
identified on gastrointestinal endoscopy (Fig. 1c), and a
biopsy revealed a NET. The serum levels of insulin, gas￾trin, and glucagon were within normal ranges. CT did
not initially reveal evidence of pancreatic invasion be￾tween the tumor and the pancreas; however, irregular￾ities of the duodenal wall and swelling of the lymph
nodes around the pancreatic parenchyma were observed.
Thus, the patient was diagnosed with non-functional
duodenal NET with multiple liver metastases, T2N1M1
stage IV (UICC 8th). In addition, CT revealed the ana￾tomical variation of the CHA, which branched from the
SMA and ran fully through the head of the pancreatic
parenchyma (Fig. 1a, d, Additional file 1 Figure S1). The
CHA branches into the left hepatic artery (LHA), the
middle hepatic artery (MHA), and the right hepatic

artery (RHA) (Fig. 2a, b). Furthermore, a developed gas￾tric arterial arcade, 4 mm in diameter, was found be￾tween the left gastric artery (LGA) and the right gastric
artery (RGA). The RGA was branched from a distal por￾tion at a distance of 10 mm from the root of the LHA
(Fig. 2a, b). Incidentally, we did not observe stenosis of
the celiac axis due to compression by the median arcu￾ate ligament. We planned PD and left trisectionectomy
with caudate lobectomy combined resection of the
tp-CHA with the preservation of the gastric arterial ar￾cade in order to maintain arterial flow of the remnant
liver, preserving the route of the celiac artery to the right
posterior hepatic artery (RPHA) via the gastric arterial
arcade from the LGA to the RGA, LHA, and RHA. If
the hepatic arterial flow could not be maintained by this
route, the preservation of the tp-CHA by separating
from pancreatic parenchyma or arterial reconstruction
using radial artery graft between CHA and RHA was
planned. Four weeks after percutaneous transhepatic
portal embolization, surgery was carried out.
After laparotomy, the gastric arterial arcade was ex￾posed and encircled, and the LHA, RHA, and proper
hepatic artery (PHA) were encircled (Fig. 3a). The
LHA was divided at the distal side of the origin of
the RGA. The MHA and the right anterior hepatic
artery (RAHA) were also divided. The left portal
branch and the right anterior portal branch were di￾vided (Fig. 3b). The liver was transected, and the left
hepatic duct and right anterior hepatic duct were di￾vided. The left trisections and caudate lobe were ana￾tomically resected. After clamping the PHA, the
hepatic arterial signals of the RPHA via the gastric ar￾terial arcade were confirmed by intraoperative Dop￾pler ultrasonography (Fig. 3c). After trisectionectomy
and caudate lobectomy, PD was performed. The pan￾creatic head was dissected from the SMA after the
upper jejunum was divided. The pancreas was divided
in front of the SMV. Finally, the specimen was only
connected by the tp-CHA and the common hepatic
duct (CHD) (Fig. 3d). The hepatic arterial signals of
the RPHA was maintained after clamping the PHA.
The PHA and the origin of CHA were divided, and
the tp-CHA was taken out with the pancreatic head
(Fig. 3e). The CHD was divided, and the specimen
was removed (Fig. 3f). Reconstruction was performed
via modified Child’s method. The operative time was
1072 min and the intraoperative blood loss was
3052 ml, and red blood cell transfusion was per￾formed (1680 ml).
Postoperatively, the patient developed pancreatic fis￾tula (Clavien-Dindo IIIa) and biliary leak (Clavien-Dindo
IIIa), and these complications were treated conserva￾tively. There were no signs of hepatic ischemia. The pa￾tient was discharged on postoperative day 39. The
pathological diagnosis was duodenal neuroendocrine
tumor G2 with multiple liver metastases. The Ki-67 la￾beling index was < 20%, and staining for chromogranin
A and synaptophysin were positive. There was no evi￾dence of invasion of the pancreatic parenchyma; how￾ever, the duodenal tumor was confined to the MP
layer, and one of the 25 examined lymph nodes was
positive, and moderate lymphovascular invasion was
observed. The final diagnosis was pMP, med, INFa,
ly1, v2, pPM0, pDM0, and pEM0. The patient has
shown no recurrence in the 22 months since the op￾eration. Enhanced abdominal CT at 4 months after
surgery revealed the blood flow of the RPHA via the
gastric arcade (Fig. 4).

Discussion
Over the years, several authors have described variations
in the hepatic arterial anatomy; a CHA arising from the
SMA—called the hepatomesenteric type—is a rare clin￾ical entity. Yang et al. and Hiatt et al. reported that this
condition was observed in only 31 of 1324 patients and
15 of 1000 patients, respectively [1, 2]. A CHA passing
through the pancreatic head parenchyma, tp-CHA, is
even rarer; Yang et al. [1] reported that among 31 pa￾tients with the hepatomesenteric type, only 3 had this
condition.
When PD is scheduled in such patients with tp-CHA,
it is important to maintain the arterial supply to the
liver. Surgeons should preoperatively determine whether
to preserve or perform combined resection of the
tp-CHA. Tp-CHA preservation was selected in several
previous reports [4, 5, 7]. This surgical procedure is
technically feasible; however, there is a risk of a positive
surgical margin or insufficient lymph node dissection
and a tendency for increased intraoperative blood loss
during the separation of the pancreatic parenchyma. If

the tp-CHA is resected, reconstruction is usually neces￾sary in order to maintain the hepatic arterial flow. Previ￾ous reports [5, 8, 9] have described successful arterial
reconstruction after CHA resection during PD; however,
such procedures are associated with an increased risk of
thromboembolism, which can lead to a fatal outcome,
especially in HPD [7]. In contrast, when collateral circu￾lation develops, surgeons can perform combined
resection of the tp-CHA, preserving the collateral circu￾lation without arterial reconstruction. Several reports
have recommended preoperative embolization of CHA
in order to maintain the hepatic arterial flow through
enlarged collateral arteries [10]. Although preoperative
embolization can increase the liver arterial flow through
collateral arteries, it is not routinely recommended be￾cause of the risk of complications, which includes the
migration of embolic material [11, 12].
A developed gastric arcade or pancreaticoduodenal ar￾cade is frequently seen in patients with the stenosis of
the CHA due to factors such as compression by the me￾dian arcuate ligament [13]. There are only a few cases in
which the hepatomesenteric trunk and the tp-CHA and
the association between the tp-CHA and the develop￾ment of a gastric arterial arcade have not been reported.
On the other hand, Miyamoto et al. reported the case of
a patient with pancreatic head cancer with a CHA aris￾ing from the SMA who underwent radical PD combined
with the resection of the CHA, in which the hepatic ar￾terial flow was maintained via the gastric arterial arcade
[14]. In this report, the patient did not have a developed
gastric arterial arcade; however, the hepatic arterial flow
via the gastric arterial arcade was sufficient and hepatic
ischemia was not detected after the operation. Consider￾ing this case, even if the patients with tp-CHA do not
have a developed gastric arterial arcade, surgeons may
be able to preserve hepatic arterial flow via the gastric
arterial arcade alone. If the hepatic arterial flow via the
gastric arterial arcade alone is adequate after clamping
the PHA, the combined resection of the tp-CHA can be
considered, even if the gastric arcade is not developed
before surgery. In cases in which the hepatic arterial flow
is not adequate, the preservation of the tp-CHA or arter￾ial reconstruction should be considered.
When performing HPD, a PD-first procedure before
hepatectomy is generally performed, as this approach is
anatomically rational [15]. However, in the present case,
performing hepatectomy after PD carried a risk of the
arterial supply to the liver being reduced during hepatec￾tomy. Had we chosen a PD-first procedure and the hep￾atic arterial flow not been maintained after CHA
resection, it would have been necessary to perform arter￾ial reconstruction before liver transection. This method
is associated with a risk of injury to the reconstructed
artery and thrombosis during liver transection. Given
the above, we opted to perform hepatectomy before PD
in our patient with a tp-CHA undergoing HPD.
In the procedure for separating the tp-CHA from the
pancreatic parenchyma entirely, the surgeon should be
concerned about the increasing rate of hemorrhage, sur￾gery time, and the risk of injury to the tp-CHA. The sur￾gical reconstruction of the hepatic artery when
performing HPD is also associated with a high degree of
risk. The association between tp-CHA and gastric arter￾ial arcade was recognized on preoperative CT scans; the
development of this collateral circulation may have the
potential to prevent ischemia-related liver complications.
From these points of view, the preoperative identifica￾tion of the developed arcade of the gastric arteries helps
in planning an appropriate operative procedure, and this
procedure seems to be a viable and simple option. To
our knowledge, this is the first report of PD combined
with resection of a tp-CHA without preoperative
embolization. Furthermore, this is also the first report of
HPD for a patient with a tp-CHA. The preoperative
identification of the developed arcade of the gastric ar￾teries helps in planning the appropriate operative pro￾cedure when PD is scheduled for patients with a
tp-CHA.
Conclusions
When planning PD for patients with a tp-CHA, a pre￾cise preoperative evaluation and the adoption of the sur￾gical strategy and technique for each individual case are
critical to preserving the hepatic arterial flow.
