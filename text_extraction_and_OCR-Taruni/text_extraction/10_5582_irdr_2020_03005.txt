Congenital extrahepatic portosystemic shunt, incidence, mechanism, complications, diagnosis, 
treatment, review
Extrahepatic portosystemic shunt belongs to a family of rare vascular abnormalities. The clinical 
importance and manifestations of this vascular abnormality range from asymptomatic cases to 
liver or metabolic dysfunctions of various degrees. Congenital extrahepatic portosystemic shunt, 
also termed as Abernethy malformation, is a very rare congenital vascular malformation in which 
splenomesenteric blood drains into a systemic vein, bypassing the liver through a complete or 
partial extrahepatic shunt. So far, limited cases of congenital extrahepatic portosystemic shunt have 
been reported. In this review, incidence, mechanisms, complications, diagnoses and treatments of 
congenital extrahepatic portosystemic shunt are described.
1. Introduction
Extrahepatic portosystemic shunt belongs to a family 
of rare vascular abnormalities. Clinical importance of 
this vascular abnormality lies in its broad spectrum of 
symptoms and complications, ranging from incidentally 
discovered asymptomatic cases to liver or metabolic 
dysfunctions of various degrees and even severe clinical 
scenarios, which are caused by variations in sites or 
types of shunt (1). Congenital extrahepatic portosystemic 
shunt (CEPS), also termed as Abernethy malformation, 
is a very rare congenital vascular malformation in which 
splenomesenteric blood drains directly into a systemic 
vein, bypassing the liver through a complete or partial 
extrahepatic shunt. Since it was first documented in 
1793 by John Abernethy (2), the number of reported 
cases has progressively increased (3). As is proposed 
by Morgan and Superina, CEPS is classified into two 
variants based on absence (type 1) or presence (type 2) 
of intrahepatic portal supply (4,5). Type 1 is described as 
complete portosystemic shunts (Figure A, end-to-side, a 
complete extrahepatic shunt) and the liver is not perfused 
with portal blood; whereas type 2 is defined as a certain 
proportion of portal blood perfused to the liver and the 
remaining portal flow bypasses the liver and is diverted 
into a systemic vein through a partial shunt (Figure B, 
side-to-side, a partial extrahepatic shunt) (4,6). This 
classification has been widely recognized and referred 
by a lot of studies because of its practical understanding 
of pathophysiologic implications and managements 
of included cases. In this review, we mainly present 
incidence, mechanisms, complications, diagnoses and 
treatments of CEPS.
2. Incidence
Knowledge about CEPS is scarce given that the low 
incidence of this malformation has prevented realization 
of large studies. Several issues stay unanswered, such 
as the actual incidence of CEPS. With limited sources, 
incidence of CEPS was once described close to 1/30,000 
births and the prevalence proportion of permanent 
CEPS was 1/50,000, which came from results of a 
nationwide galactosemia survey. Because CEPS gave 
rise to increased levels of bile acids and galactoses, 
the incidence was extrapolated. Of note, only 7 CEPS 
cases were diagnosed and biases might remain in that 
survey (7,8). To a certain degree, the assumption that

CEPS could be diagnosed through increases in blood 
galactoses after birth yet requires further validations, and 
this incidence ought to be accepted with suspicions of a 
certain degree (7). No remarkable gender predominance 
was found in CEPS (9); however, it has been described 
in certain researches that type 1 shunts feature a 
significant female predilection of 61-78%, while no 
clear explanation is given (7,10). Thus, future studies to 
systematically evaluate presence of CEPS are warranted.
3. Mechanism
Rather limited researches have explored etiology 
mechanisms of CEPS. Two possible explanations have 
dominated literatures on development of CEPS: i) A 
genetic origin and complex congenital malformation 
processes: such malformations are considered to originate 
from an insult occurring in week 4-10 of embryological 
development, which is a crucial stage for hepatic and 
systemic vessel formations. And this to certain degree 
give evidence to the fair association with cardiac and 
other vascular anomalies (7); ii) The absence of ductus 
venosus during fetal stage: abnormal vessels may 
develop in association with occlusions or agenesis of 
ductus venosus. Through abnormal vessels, oxygenated 
blood from the umbilical vein flows into the fetal heart. 
Afterwards, certain vessels may persist and develop 
into anabnormal shunt, resulting in hypoplasia of the 
portal venous system (11,12). As is shown in literatures, 
absence of ductus venosus has been documented among 
some CEPS children (13,14).
Etiology mechanisms of CEPS differ significantly 
from that of acquired extrahepatic portosystemic shunts. 
As to acquired extrahepatic portosystemic shunts, due 
to liver cirrhosis, collateral vessels would generate or 
reopen to compensate for blocked or narrowed portal 
veins, so as to lower pressures on the portal tree. 
Gradually, this will result in an acquired extrahepatic 
portosystemic shunt (15,16). Hence, variations of 
therapeutic strategies should be noted for CEPS and 
acquired extrahepatic portosystemic shunts.
4. Complications
Spectrums of clinical variants of CEPS ranges from 
completely asymptomatic forms to severe forms of 
hepatic encephalopathy, hepatopulmonary syndromes 
(HPS) and pulmonary arterial hypertension (PaHT).
4.1. Hepatic encephalopathy
Hepatic encephalopathy is a common clinical 
manifestation in symptomatic patients, with a reported 
incidence of as high as 17-30% (7,14,17,18). Blood 
ammonia produced by gastrointestinal tracts directly 
bypasses the liver and flows into inferior vena cava, 
then it is metabolized in astrocytes to glutamine, 
which in turn has deleterious effects on the brain. This 
phenomenon is more frequently seen among older 
patients. Most children with CEPS are asymptomatic, 
which proves that children are more resistant to hepatic 
encephalopathies than adults. Partially, this might 
be caused by ageing of brain, decreased blood-brain 
barriers and losses of brain reserves, all of which make 
patients more vulnerable to harmful metabolic products 
such as ammonia and facilitate the revelations of hepatic 
encephalopathies (19-21). In a previous international 
observational study, Baiges, A. described that 29% of 
patients with CEPS presented hepatic encephalopathies 
at a certain time during the study. Median age at hepatic 
encephalopathy onset or diagnosis was 12 years (range, 
5-65). Different patterns of hepatic encephalopathy were 
documented with a fair predominance of chronic hepatic 
encephalopathy: 73.7% featured persistent hepatic 
encephalopathy with permanent cognitive impairment, 
11.0% featured recurrent hepatic encephalopathy, and 
15.3% featured episodic hepatic encephalopathy. In 
most cases, in accordance with West-Haven standard, 
episodes of hepatic encephalopathies were of moderate 
intensities (20).
4.2. Pulmonary complications
Patients with CEPS will be frequently associated with 
severe pulmonary complications, such as HPS (7,22) 
and PaHT (14,23). Developments of HPS and PaHT 
can be linked with vasoactive mediators from intestines 
(22,24,25). Such mediators skip hepatic circulations and 
directly approach the pulmonary vascular bed, causing 
pulmonary circulation imbalances and inducing a long￾term pulmonary vasoconstriction in PaHT (9,24) or, 
reversely, a pulmonary vasodilation in HPS (26).
HPS is a clinical relationship between hepatic 
diseases and existence of pulmonary vascular dilatations, 
which is characterized by presence of dyspnea 
and hypoxia and can result in arterial oxygenation 
abnormalities of a certain range. Prevalence of HPS

into a systemic vein through a partial shunt (side-to-side). IVC,

nodules, 70% of them had focal nodular hyperplasia or 
regenerative nodular hyperplasia, 20% had hepatocellular 
carcinoma, and 10% had adenomas; also, it has been 
shown in researches that 21% of patients had single 
nodules and 79% had multiple nodules (9,14,20,21,31). 
Hence, it should be noted that performances of a rigorous 
and periodic screening of liver nodules for patients with 
CEPS is of significant needs and values. Furthermore, 
researchers have also advocated that it is sensible to 
term cirrhosis strategies of hepatocellular carcinoma 
surveillance every half year (20).
5. Diagnosis
CEPS can be diagnosed at any age, which is often in 
childhood during the setting of neonatal cholestasis, 
hypergalactosemia, failures to thrive, psychomotor 
delays or other congenital defects. Prenatal diagnoses 
will be considered through ultrasound detections of 
abnormal communication vessels between portal and 
peripheral venous systems or an enlarged umbilical vein 
(9,14,35,36). In adulthood, CEPS could be incidentally 
diagnosed through abdominal ultrasound, computed 
tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI) in the screening of unexplained abdominal pains, 
abnormal liver functions and hepatic nodules, or etc. (37-
39). Of note, for accurate diagnoses of CEPS, one should 
first excluded potential acquired portosystemic shunts, 
such as those patients with hepatic cirrhosis, with or 
without concomitant presentations of portal hypertension 
(40), and surgically created portosystemic shunts (41). 
Generally, non-congenital or acquired shunts are small, 
tortuous peripheral vessels, and CEPS patients will not 
present hepatic cirrhosis or portal hypertension imaging 
features (ascites, varices, or splenomegaly) (42,43).
Ultrasound is widely utilized in abdominal diseases 
for its safe and fast imaging properties. Primarily, it 
can be a useful diagnostic tool to identify presence of 
portosystemic shunts. Doppler ultrasound is of special 
diagnostic values for its abilities to assess vessel flow 
directions. As is reported previously (35), clinically 
asymptomatic shunts have been occasionally diagnosed 
in children through ultrasound during galactosaemia 
test. Ponziani FR, et al. have summarized concomitant 
presence of five ultrasound signs to strengthen the 
suspicion of CEPS (39), including: i) Solid focal lesions 
in liver parenchyma; ii) Portal trunk absence/hypoplasia; 
iii) Deficiencies of intrahepatic portal vessels and 
flow signals; iv) Existence of porto/systemic shunts; 
v) Hepatic artery hypertrophies. However, ultrasound 
might fail to accurately detect inapparent or small shunts. 
Hence, anomalies identified by ultrasound should be 
further confirmed through other imaging methods (44).
Radiological methods like CT or MRI are preferred 
investigations to confirm a portosystemic shunt. 
Asymptomatic CEPS are often diagnosed through 
incidental presentations on CT or MRI scans in 
among patients with CEPS is still not clear, because mild 
HPS are often asymptomatic and a comprehensive study 
on lungs cannot always be carried out on all patients. 
Hence, an actual prevalence cannot be accurately 
predicted. In addition, it is recognized that CEPS should 
be considered as one of the etiologies of HPS (27). 
Since the first case report about CEPS with HPS by 
Papagiannis (28), there have been more than 20 similar 
cases described in literatures (22,29,30). A baseline 
comprehensive assessment on pulmonary complications 
is suggested to be undergone. In follow-up durations, 
transcutaneous oxygen saturation measurements can be 
of help in early and primary detections of HPS.
It has been demonstrated that PaHT is a considerable 
issue among CEPS patients, inducing symptomatic 
dyspnea in about 80% of cases; it has been shown by 
data that PaHT occurred in 13-66% of children with 
CEPS (17,23). When carefully screened, PaHT is also 
manifested on nearly 11% of asymptomatic patients 
(20). Rarity of such disease and the small amount of 
patient series have led to a rather broad percentage 
range. Despite virous hypotheses and reports, PaHT 
mechanisms stay controversial. From histological 
perspective, the lungs present microthrombotic lesions, 
and it is considered that PaHT resulted from recurrent 
microemboli originating in the mesenteric circulation 
and travelling through a portosystemic shunt directly 
to the lungs (23). Symptoms of PaHT vary from 
disturbed consciousness to syncope. Right ventricular 
hypertrophies, decompressions of left ventricle or an 
increased estimated right ventricular systolic pressure are 
vital signs of an echocardiography. Notably, PaHT is not 
seemingly related to severity or degree of a shunt, while 
it features a decreased outcome, with a reported morality 
of nearly 50% (7). As PaHT can occur in a broad range 
of age, periodic and regular surveillances for PaHT may 
be of a great significance during follow-ups.
4.3. Liver nodules
An abnormal shunt of blood leads to non-specific liver 
disturbances because of uneven portal flow perfusions 
and arterialisations (compensatory increases in hepatic 
arterial flows). In ischemic liver parenchyma, absent or 
reduced portal flows result in lacks of nutrition and fatty 
degenerations in hepatocytes; thusly, liver dysfunctions 
occur, certain normal hepatocytes diminish, and hepatic 
atrophy follows; in well perfused areas, regenerative 
nodule generated. Altogether, these elements contribute 
to abnormal hepatic developments and functions, which 
will bring an incentive to nodule generations (21,31,32).
Nodular liver tumors are commonly seen in as many 
as 40-65% of patients with CEPS. Although most of 
such tumors are benign, among other neoplastic lesions, 
malignancies such as hepatocellular carcinomas and 
adenomas have also been reported (20,21,33,34). In 
a case series involving 26 CEPS patients with liver

abdominal imaging. CT and MRI are also of great values 
in further classifications of shunts and measurements 
of accompanying anomalies (10). Postprocessing 
technologies, such as multiplanar reformations, have 
supplied additional information about diagnoses and 
managements.
A Contrast-enhanced CT can document anatomies, 
locations and sizes of abnormal shunts. With techniques 
like maximum intensity projection and multiplanar 
reconstruction, much information will be provided by 
CT, including shunt courses, sizes and orientations, 
which help both radiologists and surgeons to make or 
choose suitable treatment regimens.
Furthermore, MR can be used to visualize shunts 
and avoid radiation exposures for both radiologists and 
patients. Particularly, in assessments of associated liver 
nodules, MRI includes diffusion sequences and shows 
unique advantages over CT (10). Compared to CT, MRI 
would be preferred as the first-choice test. A research 
team from Canada analyzed 61 reported cases of CEPS 
and recommended MRI as a superior tool in diagnoses 
and classifications of CEPS as well as examinations of 
associated cardiovascular and hepatic abnormalities (42). 
Furthermore, MRI angiography serves as a reliable and 
noninvasive examination for hepatic vascular anatomies. 
Despite this, CT can be reserved for patients who are 
noncooperative or have specific contraindications. 
Traditionally, conventional angiography is regarded 
as a golden standard for detections of portomesenteric 
vasculatures. However, improvements in CT and MRI 
techniques have changed the situation. Currently, 
conventional angiography is not necessarily a must in 
CEPS diagnoses, for CT and MRI can provide accurate 
diagnoses in most cases.
According to existing findings on nuclear medicine 
researches, iodine-123 iodoamphetamine could also be 
used to measure shunt dynamics (10,19).
Furthermore, serum ammonia level is useful, 
although it is a non-specific and investigative adjunct. 
In 66-100% of CEPS cases, a heightened level of serum 
ammonia is found (7). Hence, concentrations of ammonia 
without known hepatic cirrhosis or portal hypertensions 
ought to imply subsequent examinations for CEPS (45). 
In certain cases, liver biopsies may illustrate small portal 
venules within portal triads, which is indicative of type 2 
shunt (42).
6. Treatment
Currently, there is no standard therapeutic approach to 
treat extrahepatic portosystemic shunts due to rarity of 
such diseases (46). Several approaches including shunt 
closures through surgical or radiological interventions 
and liver transplantations have been proposed, but 
clear comparisons among different treatment strategies 
are still unavailable. Treatment strategies are decided 
according to shunt types, locations, symptoms severities 
and related complications. There still remains debate 
regarding therapeutic strategies for asymptomatic cases 
(1,46). Conservative managements including lifestyle 
changes, such as protein restrictions as well as lactulose 
and non-absorbable antibiotics administrations, may be 
recommended in asymptomatic shunts. Yet, presence of 
shunts could potentially develop clinical implications, 
such as supplying a route for intestinal toxic materials to 
bypass hepatic circulations, immune surveillances as well 
as offering a possible route for lung tumor metastases of 
gastrointestinal tumors (1,19). A Japanese research team 
has previously observed natural courses of 51 patients 
with CEPS and found that spontaneous shunt closures 
were never evident. Hence, early detections and suitable 
therapies are vital for a good prognosis (32).
6.1. Shunt closure for type 2 CEPS
Discrepancies regarding management of patients 
with asymptomatic type 2 did exist. Researchers 
from University of Catania chose active surveillances 
(46). However, more experts urge early and active 
interventions to be mandatory (9,47). When a clear 
diagnosis of extrahepatic shunt is made, it is important 
to remark that shunt closures facilitating progressive 
redirections of portal blood flowing to livers are possible 
and essential for such patients. As is proved in treatments 
of Abernethy malformations, shunt closures are 
especially useful in improving hepatic encephalopathies. 
Baiges A, et al. suggested that shunt closures had a huge 
efficacy in managing most shunt complications and, most 
interestingly, preventing their occurrences (3); this is in 
agreement with findings of Papamichail M. et al., who 
proved that early occlusions would reverse associated 
complications (48). Sanada Y, et al. and Pathak A, et 
al. had also demonstrated that patients with CEPS and 
hepatic encephalopathies can benefit by early shunt 
occlusion surgeries (49,50).
Therefore, shunt closures must always be considered 
for symptomatic patients and should also be regarded 
as a prophylactic treatment early in evolutions of the 
disease to prevent developments of severe complications. 
Earlier studies have shown that for shunt occlusions, 
either interventional embolization or surgical ligations 
(open or laparoscopic surgical techniques) can be choices 
of treatment that lead to rapid ameliorations of symptoms 
and normalizations of ammonia levels (25,51). Likewise, 
multiple results have proved that the associated HPS 
could also be resolved by shunt closures (25,26,52,53). 
The choice from an interventional embolization or a 
surgical ligation depends upon medical expertise, shunt 
vessel anatomies and sizes as well as induvial general 
conditions (48,54,55). For patients with wide and short 
shunt vessels or those who fail to receive embolization, a 
surgical ligation will be preferred (54,56).
6.2. Liver transplantation for type 1 CEPS

www.irdrjournal.com
Intractable & Rare Diseases Research. 2020; 9(2):64-70. 68
Shunt closures are not a feasible option for patients with 
type 1 CEPS, as the shunt stands for the only drainage 
path of mesenteric and splenic venous blood. Thusly, 
liver transplantation serves as effective therapeutic 
approaches for both liver and pulmonary complications. 
Literatures have described the successful application 
of liver transplantation for CEPS patients with severe 
complications (including refractory encephalopathy, 
CEPS associated with biliary atresia, or patients with 
severe HPS) (37,57,58).
Timing of liver transplantations for type 1 CEPS is 
still a matter of debate. Results from Japan show that 
prophylactic liver transplantations should be justified 
prior to occurrences of severe pulmonary complications 
(HPS or PaHT), because such complications would 
complicate or even preclude liver transplantations (57). 
However, Guerin F, et al. found that asymptomatic 
patients with type 1 CEPS ought not to receive liver 
transplantations as a prophylactic option, which 
would make them experience prolonged periods of 
immunosuppression (7). Sakamoto S, et al. reviewed 
a collection of 34 transplantation cases of CEPS and 
concluded that presence of pulmonary complications 
was an early indication of liver transplantations; 
in the review, 30 out of 34 CEPS cases with liver 
transplantations stayed alive after a median follow-up 
period of one and a half years, indicating an encouraging 
outcome (6). Sanada Y, et al. also revealed that liver 
transplantations could be potentially curative for patients 
with symptomatic type 1 CEPS (49). In most reported 
cases, liver transplantations provide a complete resolution 
for associated complications. Technical difficulties of 
portal system anatomies and reconstructions are main 
challenges (39).
6.3. Management of liver nodules
When liver nodules are identified in patients with CEPS, 
differential diagnoses of malignant and benign tumors 
will be crucial for determination of following treatments. 
For benign tumors, conservative treatments and regular 
follow-ups should be suggested. In cases of malignant 
tumors, subsequent surgical interventions like biopsies 
will be adequate.
At last, a close surveillance is indicated for patients 
with such vascular malformations. Long-term follow￾ups will create a good clinical compliance and provide 
a comprehensive understanding and management of 
disease processes.
7. Conclusion
Differential diagnoses between CEPS and acquired 
portosystemic shunts are of much importance. When 
a clear diagnosis of CEPS is made, it is important to 
remark that active interventions are possible and essential 
for such patients. As to type 1 CEPS, liver transplantation 
serves as an effective therapeutic approach for both 
liver and pulmonary complications; as with type 2 
CEPS, shunt closures must always be considered for 
symptomatic patients and should also be regarded as a 
prophylactic treatment early in evolutions of the disease, 
so as to prevent developments of severe complications. 
Yet, knowledge about CEPS is scarce due to its low 
incidence. Future studies on systematical explorations on 
CEPS are warranted.
