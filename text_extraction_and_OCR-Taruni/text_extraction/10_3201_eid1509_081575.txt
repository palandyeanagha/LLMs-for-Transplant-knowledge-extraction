Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV) DNA was detected
in 88% of Merkel cell carcinomas in contrast to 16% of other
skin tumors. MCPyV was also found in anogenital and oral
samples (31%) and eyebrow hairs (50%) of HIV-positive
men and in forehead swabs (62%) of healthy controls.
MCPyV thus appears to be widespread.
Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV) was recently dis￾covered in Merkel cell carcinomas (MCC), rare but 
aggressive skin cancers (1). MCPyV DNA has been de￾tected in the majority of MCC and less commonly in other 
skin tumors and healthy skin (1–6). To help determine if 
MCPyV might be widespread in the general population, we 
conducted a retrospective study and tested MCC as well as 
healthy and lesional skin and mucosa samples of immuno￾competent and immunosuppressed persons without MCC 
for MCPyV-DNA. 
The Study
All samples (n = 355) were analyzed by hot-start sin￾gle-round LT3-PCR (sPCR) and nested LT1/M1M2-PCR 
(nPCR) by using primers described previously (1) (experi￾mental details on DNA isolation, controls, and PCR con￾ditions are available from U.W.). Because analytical sen￾sitivities of sPCR and nPCR were 1,000 copies of cloned 
LT3-DNA and 10 copies of cloned LT1-DNA per assay, 
samples positive by both PCRs probably had higher viral 
loads than those positive only by nPCR. The sPCR- or 
nPCR-products of 19 MCC and 48 non-MCC samples were 
sequenced and were MCPyV specific.
MCPyV DNA was detectable in 30/34 (88%) MCC bi￾opsies and in 5/5 (100%) MCC metastases by nPCR, and in 
68% and 80%, respectively, by sPCR. MCPyV DNA was 
found by nPCR only in 1/13 (7.7%) whole blood samples 
of MCC-patients. The patient with MCPyV-positive blood 
had positive sPCR/nPCR results for MCC and positive 
nPCR results for a second sample taken from the previ￾ous MCC site. Of 5 further non-MCC biopsy samples from 
MCC patients, 1 skin sample from a patient with unspecific 
dermatitis was positive by nPCR.
MCPyV DNA was traceable only by nPCR in 10/61 
(16%) biopsy samples of different non-MCC skin tumors 
and in 8/34 (24%) of perilesional, clinically, and histolo￾gically healthy skin samples from 56 immunocompetent 
patients (7) without MCC (Table 1). MCPyV DNA status 
was identical in 30/32 pairs of tumor and corresponding 
perilesional skin samples (negative/negative in 24, positive/
positive in 6, divergent in 2 pairs). MCPyV was found signifi￾cantly more often in MCC (n = 34) than in non-MCC skin tu￾mors (n = 61) or perilesional skin biopsies (n = 34) (p<0.001; 
χ2
 test).
Mucosal samples were available from 79 HIV-infected 
men who have sex with men (HIV-MSM) (without MCC) 
participating in an anogenital dysplasia/human papilloma￾virus (HPV) screening program (8). MCPyV DNA was de￾tectable in 37/120 (31%) of all mucosal (anal, penile, oral) 
samples by nPCR and in 10/120 (8%) by sPCR (Table 2). 
In anal samples, MCPyV DNA positivity was lowest in 
anal cancer tissues (14% by nPCR), followed by dysplasias 
(26%), swabs with normal cytology (30%), and benign le￾sions (33%). Similar values were found for penile samples; 
29% of dysplasias, 33% of benign lesions, and 50% of nor￾mal swabs were MCPyV DNA positive. In oral samples, 
MCPyV DNA was detected in 39% of normal swabs, in 
0% of benign lesions, and in 50% of carcinomas in situ. 
MCPyV DNA positivity was not associated with the pres￾ence of mucosal premalignant and malignant lesions (p = 
0.597; n = 120; 1-sided analysis of variance test), in contrast

to positivity for high-risk (HR)-alpha-HPV, the established 
etiologic agents of these lesions (p = 0.001; n = 120) (Table 
2). MCPyV DNA positivity was not significantly different 
in mucosal samples from HIV-MSM with CD4 counts be￾low or above 200/μL (29% vs. 32%; p = 0.839; n = 120; χ2
test). For HR-HPV, a trend for a higher detection rate in 
patients with CD4 counts <200/μL could be observed (80% 
vs. 67%; p = 0.145; n = 120) (Table 2). In 7 cerebrospinal 
fluid samples from HIV-MSM with central nervous system 
problems, MCPyV DNA was not detected.
In an immunodeficient patient with WILD syndrome 
(warts, immunodeficiency, lymphedema, anogenital dys￾plasia) (9), MCPyV DNA was found by nPCR and sPCR 
on the abdominal, thigh, perianal, and vulvar skin, and 
by nPCR in the vagina, cervix, and intraanal canal (20/27 
swabs were nPCR- and 4/27 sPCR-positive). A whole blood 
sample and 5 papilloma biopsies were MCPyV DNA nega￾tive. MCPyV DNA was detected by nPCR in the cellular 
pellet but not in the supernatant of a urine sample of the pa￾tient with WILD syndrome. The presence of MCPyV DNA 
in the cellular pellet was probably caused by MCPyV- posi￾tive urogenital cells flushed into the urine.
MCPyV DNA was not found in 13 BKPyV DNA posi￾tive urine samples from 11 renal-transplant recipients with￾out MCC. MCPyV DNA was detected by nPCR in 7/14 
(50%) of plucked eyebrow hairs of 14 HIV-MSM and by 
sPCR in 5/14 (36%) (Table 2) as well as in eyebrow hairs 
of the patient with WILD syndrome (nPCR-positive). Skin 
swabs covering 20 cm2
 of the forehead were taken from 13 
healthy immunocompetent male adults (10), and MCPyV 
DNA was detected by nPCR in 8/13 (62%) and by sPCR 
in 5/13 (38%).
Conclusions
Using nested PCR, we found MCPyV DNA in 88% 
of in samples from persons with MCC. In 68%, viral DNA 
load was high enough to be detectable by sPCR. This find￾ing is similar to detection rates reported before (54%–89%) 
(1–6) and confirms the association of MCPyV with MCC.
The MCPyV positivity of 16% in non-MCC skin tu￾mors was significantly lower than in MCC; MCPyV DNA 
was only detectable by nPCR, pointing to lower viral loads 
than in MCC. Similar to our results, MCPyV DNA has 
been found in 12.5% of basal cell carcinomas and viral load 
was 4-log lower than in MCC (2). In other studies, MCPyV 
DNA was detected in 13% of squamous cell carcinomas 
and only in 1 keratoacanthoma of 156 non-melanoma skin 
cancers (4,6). The relatively low detection rate of MCPyV 
in non-MCC skin tumors, similar to that in healthy, perile￾sional skin, suggests that MCPyV probably does not play a 
role in the development of non-MCC skin tumors.
HR-alpha-HPV induces anogenital dysplasia/cancer 
and HIV-MSM have a strongly increased risk for develop￾ing these lesions (11). In anogenital samples of HIV-MSM, 
MCPyV DNA was less common in premalignant and ma￾lignant lesion samples than in benign samples or samples

*MCPyV, Merkel cell polyomavirus; nPCR, nested PCR; sPCR, single-round PCR; HPV, human papillomavirus; HR, high-risk alpha-HPV. All samples 
were tested for beta-HPV. Eyebrow hairs were additionally tested for alpha-HPV, and all were positive; 2 were additionally low-risk alpha-HPV–positive. 
Alpha- and beta-HPV DNA were determined by PCRs as previously described (8). 
†HR types comprise HPV16, 18, 26, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 53, 56, 58, 59, 66, 68, 73, 82. For details of the patient-collective see (8). 
‡Normal swabs were those negative for intraepithelial lesion or malignancy. 

with normal cytology. Thus, it is unlikely that MCPyV 
plays a role in the development of anogenital dysplasia/can￾cer in HIV-MSM. In contrast to HR-alpha-HPV, MCPyV 
recovery was not increased in HIV-MSM with advanced 
immunodeficiency.
MCPyV DNA was detected only once in hematolym￾phoid tissue and never in donated blood (5,12). Similarly, 
we could not detect MCPyV DNA in 12/13 blood samples 
obtained from patients with MCC and in the blood sample 
of the patient with WILD syndrome, who was MCPyV 
positive in numerous other samples. MCPyV DNA was not 
found in BKPyV-positive urine samples from renal trans￾plant recipients or in the cell-free urine supernatant of the 
patient with WILD syndrome.
In normal skin, MCPyV DNA has been identified be￾fore by PCR and Southern blot in 1/6 biopsies (1) but not 
in 15 samples when real-time PCR was used (4). Surpris￾ingly, we found MCPyV DNA by sPCR in 38% and by 
nPCR in 62% of area-wide skin swabs from the forehead 
of healthy controls. Furthermore, MCPyV DNA was found 
in 14% and 37% of normal mucosa swabs of HIV-MSM 
by sPCR and nPCR, respectively. Since Merkel cells are 
found within the basal layer of the epidermis (13), it is 
unlikely that they are collected in surface-swabs. This ob￾servation suggests that the detected MCPyV DNA either 
represents cell-free virus that may have been produced in 
Merkel cells or virus in superficial keratinocytes. Thirty￾six percent (sPCR) and 50% (nPCR) of eyebrow hairs of 
HIV-MSM carried MCPyV DNA. High concentrations of 
Merkel cells were described in the bulge region of hair fol￾licles (14). Hair bulbs have been suggested as a reservoir 
for beta-HPVs (15), and this may also be true for MCPyV. 
Our data demonstrate a widespread distribution of MCPyV 
in normal skin, mucosa and hair bulbs, although MCPyV 
does not reach the magnitude found for ubiquitous beta￾HPV (10,15). Our nonpopulation based data need to be 
confirmed in cross-sectional studies, but it is likely that 
MCPyV is prevalent in the general population.
