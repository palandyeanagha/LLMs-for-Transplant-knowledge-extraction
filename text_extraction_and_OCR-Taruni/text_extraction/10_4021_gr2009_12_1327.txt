Study of Chronic Hepatopathy in Patients With 
Sickle Cell Disease
Maha M. Mahera, c, Amany H. Mansourb
Abstract
Background: Hepatic lesions in sickle cell disease were studied 
essentially in autopsy specimens. We investigated chronic hepatop￾athy in living adults with sickle cell disease and report the clinical, 
biochemical, and hepatic histological findings in these patients.
Methods: A total of 170 adult patients with sickle cell syndrome 
were prospectively investigated. Clinical and laboratory investiga￾tion including liver function tests, serological tests for viral hepa￾titis, autoimmune hepatitis, and abdominal ultrasonography were 
performed in all of the patients. Liver biopsies were studied from 
27 patients.
Results: There was clinical evidence of jaundice in 123 (72.4%) 
patients, 118 (69.4%) patients had palpable liver, and 69% percent 
of the patients had elevated enzymes. Serological tests demonstrat￾ed the presence of hepatitis B infection in 18 (10.6%) patients and 
hepatitis C infection in 39 (23%) patients, serological markers for 
autoimmune hepatitis were positive in two female patients, one di￾agnosed chronic intrahepatic cholestasis. All 27 biopsies presented 
some degree of sickling hepatopathy. Moderate or marked liver sid￾erosis was associated with the number of transfusions.
Conclusions: The clinical spectrum of sickle cell disease ranges 
from mild liver function test abnormalities to significant hepatic ab￾normalities with marked hyperbilirubinemia. Multiple factors may 
contribute to the etiology of the liver disease, including ischemia, 
transfusion related viral hepatitis, iron overload, and gallstones.

Introduction
Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a common genetic disorder 
which represents a major medical problem in certain parts of 
the world. It is characterized by chronic haemolytic anaemia 
and vaso-occlusive crises, which can lead to widespread vas￾cular occlusion by sickled red blood cells leading to multiple 
organ infarctions. In this respect, SCD can be considered as 
a multisystem disease [1]. 
The liver can be affected by a number of complications 
due to the disease itself and its treatment [2, 3]. The risk of 
cholelithiasis, choledocholithiasis and liver failure increases 
in these patients due to sickling. In addition, viral hepatitis 
and other hepatobiliary diseases can also occur [4, 5]. There 
are more rare complications related to the sickle cell state: 
autoimmune hepatitis, hepatic infarction, hepatic abscess, 
hepatic biloma, Budd-Chiari syndrome, hyperammonaemia 
due to zinc deficiency [6].
Most pathologic studies of liver disease in sickle cell 
anemia and its variants were performed retrospectively on 
autopsy specimens, and, because of the prominent histologic 
features of intrasinusoidal sickling and Kupffer cell erythro￾phagocytosis, hepatic dysfunction was attributed to the in￾trahepatic sickling of erythrocytes in this hemoglobinopathy. 
Evidence of liver disease in sickle cell disease is obtained 
either from abnormal biochemical tests or postmortem liver 
biopsy specimen rarely an antemortem liver specimen [7]. 
Much of the literature on sickle cell hepatopathy lacks depth, 
because there are few sizeable or controlled studies [2]. 
The present study aimed to investigate chronic hepa￾topathy in living adults with sickle cell disease and to report 
the clinical, biochemical, and hepatic histological findings in 
these patients.
Patients and Methods
 
The study was prospectively conducted from June 2007 to 
December 2008. Of 170 adult patients with sickle cell syn￾drome who admitted to King Fahd hospital (a major tertiary 
hospital in eastern region) KSA, only patients who were in

the steady state were selected.
A general examination included assessing of the sclera 
for jaundice, enlargement of the liver and stigmata for chron￾ic liver disease were done on all the patients before blood 
samples were taken for biochemical and coagulation stud￾ies. The number of transfusions received by each patient and 
alcohol or drug abuse was accurately determined. Demo￾graphic and Clinical characteristics of the study group are 
shown in Table1. 
The liver enzymes, bilirubin, prothrombin time (PT) and 
Activated Partial Thromboplastin time (APTT) were done. 
Hepatitis B serology profile anti-HCV by a third-generation 
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, a third-generation 
RIBA for HCVand the polymerase chain reaction was applied 
to patients with HCV for virus quantification. Antinuclear 
antibody (ANA), Anti–smooth muscle antibody (ASMA) 
Anti–liver-kidney microsomal antibody (anti–LKM-1), and 
serum ferritin were done. 
Abdominal ultrasound evaluation was performed in 
all patients, liver ultrasonographic changes reported were 
hepatomegaly, and cirrhosis. Abdominal ultrasound was also 
used to define patients with cholelithiasis.
A total of 27 patients satisfied the following inclusion 
criteria for hepatic biopsy and who agreed to give consent 
for liver biopsy; HBsAg positivity with altered results on 
hepatic function tests performed on two different occasions 
with an interval of at least 1 month between determinations; 
anti-HCV positivity confirmed by recombinant immunob￾lot assay (RIBA); and patients who underwent abdominal 
surgery, cholecystectomy, or splenectomy during the study 
period. 
Hepatic specimens were fixed in 10% saline formalin 
and stained with hematoxylin and eosin, Perls’ stain for 
iron, diastase-PAS, reticulin, and Gomori’s trichrome. The 
histopathologic analysis was performed by a single patholo￾gist with no previous information about the patient. Chronic 
hepatitis was also evaluated histologically by the modified 
histological activity index [8, 9]. Siderosis was graded as ab￾sent (-), mild (+), moderate (++), or marked (+++).
Statistical analysis
 
Data was analyzed using Student’s t and chi-square tests. 
The clinical, laboratory and pathological data of patients 
were compared using the nonparametric Mann-Whitney test. 
The same test was used to assess associations of the grade 
of liver siderosis and the number of previous transfusions 
with the value of ferritin. Statistical significance was set at P 
values less than 0.05.
Results
The mean age of the patients was 26.3 years (range, 17 - 46), 
34.1% were female. There was clinical evidence of jaun￾dice in 123 patients (72.4%). One hundred eighteen patients 
(69.4%) had palpable liver. Eleven patients (6.5%) had nev￾er received blood transfusion. No association was observed 
between the total number of transfusions and jaundice (p = 
0.92). Data showen in Table 1.
The mean (range) of Alanine transaminase (ALT), As￾partate transaminase (AST) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) 
were 41.0 (12 - 93) IU, 57.5 (26 - 128) IU, 268.5 (43 - 941) 
IU, respectively, Table 2. 
The gender or age of the patients did not significantly 
affect the level of the three enzymes. There was significant 
association between the liver size and elevation transaminas￾es. Thirty-one percent of the patients had normal enzymes 
while 21% had the three enzymes deranged, 15.9%, 43% and 
61.2% had abnormal ALT, AST and ALP respectively. The 
mean (range) of total bilirubin was 4.6 (0 - 31) mg/dL while 
for conjugated it was 3.1 (0 - 22.3) mg/dL. Only 18% and 
5% had deranged PT and APTT respectively. The reference 
values for PT and APTT are 12 - 14 seconds and 30 - 40 
seconds respectively.
Ferritin levels ranged from 61 to 8,134 ng/mL and were 
associated with the number of previous transfusions (above 
or below the median; Mann-Whitney, P = 0.0001). No asso￾ciation was observed between ferritin levels and the presence 
of viral hepatitis (P = 0.41).
Serological tests demonstrated the presence of hepatitis 
B infection in 18 (10.6%) patients and hepatitis C infection 
in 39 (23%). Hepatitis C serologies showed a relationship 
with the mean number of units transfused (p < 0.05) while 
hepatitis B did not (p = 0.88). Serological markers for au￾Characteristics Number

toimmune hepatitis; antinuclear and anti-smooth muscle 
antibodies were positive in two female patients. Abdominal 
ultrasound revealed hepatomegaly in 121 (71.2%) patients. 
cirrhosis in 3 (1.8%) and gall stones in 90 (53%) patients.
Biopsies were obtained from 27 patients (17 males and 
10 females), ten of them with HCV and twelve with HBV, 
the remaining five patients underwent biopsy during sple￾nectomy and cholecystectomy. The number of blood transfu￾sions was determined in all patients. The median number of 
transfusions was 27.6 (ranged 11–91 blood units).
All 27 biopsies presented some degree of sickling hepa￾topathy (3 severe, 12 moderate and 12 mild), the main path￾ological features were Kupffer cell hyperplasia (27/27), 11 
showed ischemic necrosis, 24 intrahepatic sickling and eight 
erythrophagocytosis were seen and did not correlate with 
liver disease.
Patients with HCV showed a histopathologic picture of 
chronic hepatitis; portal inflammation with formation of a 
lymphoid follicle, piecemeal necrosis and focal hepatocyte 
necrosis. A mild mononuclear inflammatory infiltrate was al￾ways present in correspondence to necrosis foci. All patients 
presented sinusoidal congestion, hypertrophy and hyperpla￾sia of Kupffer cells, and pseudoacinar regeneration. Mild 
portal fibrosis was observed in two patients. The histologic 
activity index was 2 to 4 (inflammatory grading) and 0 to 2 
(fibrotic staging).
Patients with HBV showed a histopathologic picture of 
incipient cirrhosis in three patients. The necro-inflammatory 
activity was shown by the presence of piecemeal necrosis, 
and focal hepatocyte necrosis. The portal tracts contained a 
mononuclear inflammatory infiltrate with the formation of 
lymphoid follicles. Mild sinusoidal congestion and dilata￾tion were present, hyperplasia and hypertrophy of Kupffer 
cells, and pseudoacinar regeneration. The histological activ￾ity index was 7 and 10 (inflammatory grading) and 5 and 6 
(fibrotic staging).
Moderate or marked liver siderosis was associated with 
the number of transfusions. Whereas nine patients with 
marked or moderate histological iron overload had received 
more than the median number of transfusions, patients with 
absent or mild iron overload received transfusion less than 
the median (P = 0.0001). If only patients without viral hepa￾titis are considered, the association remains significant (P = 
0.003). Detailed histopathologic findings of patients with 
sickle cell disease are shown in Table 3. 
One patient diagnosed as chronic intrahepatic cholesta￾sis; he was deeply jaundiced , dark urine and severe pruritis, 
liver edge was 7 cm below costal margin , there was no stig￾mata of liver cell failure or chronic liver disease, bilirubin 
31 mg/dL,72% conjugated, alkaline phosphatase 402 IU. 
Serological tests for hepatitis A, B and C were negative, no 
autoantibodies were detected. Abdominal ultrasound showed 
no dilatation of extrahepatic biliary dilatation. Liver biopsy 
showed maintained basic architectural pattern with mild to 
moderate piecemeal necrosis, mild spotty necrosis, sinusoi￾dal dilatation, mild to moderate inflammation and widening 
of the portal areas and cholestasis.
Liver biopsies for two female patients with positive im￾mune markers revealed signs of chronic active hepatitis with 
cirrhosis associated with dilated sinusoids lined by lympho￾cytes and hyperplastic Kupffer cells.
Discussion
Various disorders of the hepatobiliary system can occur in 
patients with sickle cell anemia. The risk of cholelithiasis, 
choledocholithiasis and liver failure increases in these pa￾tients due to sickling. In addition, viral hepatitis and other 
hepatobiliary diseases can also occur [2, 4, 5]]. Although 
there are some theories about frequency and pathophysiol￾ogy of liver disease in patients with sickle cell disease, etiol￾ogy and pathological features of chronic liver disease occur￾ring in sickle cell anemia are under debate [10].
The findings reported in the present study suggest a 
multifactorial etiology for liver disease in SCD patients, in￾cluding factors associated with chronic hemolytic anemia 
(cholelithiasis), multiple transfusions (viral hepatitis and 
iron overload) and the sickling process itself. However, data 
points to importance of vascular changes and the significant 
participation of the sickling process in most of patients, as

reported by Charlotte et al [11]. Our results also, suggested 
that vascular damage is an important cause of chronic he￾patic alteration among patients.
In our study, 39 (23%) patients had hepatitis C positive 
serologies, nearly the same results as that of De Vault et al 
who studied 121 patients and found 20.7% to be HCV Ab+ 
[12].
Fewer data have been published on hepatitis B serolo￾gies in sickle cell disease. Johnson et al [13] found the preva￾lence of HBsAg, sAb or cAb to be 19% in both SS and SC 
patients. In our patients, 18 (10.6%) had positive HBsAg, 
but 18 % had HBcAb+ and 21.2% had HBsAb+. Hepatitis 
C serologies showed a relationship with the mean number 
of units transfused while hepatitis B did not, this result is in 
agreement with other study [14].
The occurrence of autoimmune hepatitis type 1 in SCD 
patients has been previously reported in a 28-year-old wom￾an and in two 11-year-old children (one boy, one girl) [15, 
16]. In our study, serological markers for autoimmune hepa￾titis were positive in two female patients; clinically both had 
jaundice and hepatomogaly, liver biopsy revealed signs of 
chronic active hepatitis with cirrhosis associated with dilated 
sinusoids lined by lymphocytes and hyperplastic Kupffer 
cells. Perisinusoidal fibrosis was present, Whether a patho￾Table 3. Histopathologic Findings of 27 Patients With Sickle Cell Disease

physiological link exists between SCD and autoimmune 
hepatitis remains to be determined.
A distinct clinical presentation of sickle cell intrahepatic 
cholestasis, and a syndrome characterized by progressive 
cholestasis in the absence of cirrhosis had been reported in a 
small number of cases. These cases are characterized by right 
upper quadrant pain, extreme elevation of bilirubin, striking 
elevation of alkaline phosphatase and variable elevation of 
transaminases, histological features: intracanalicular cho￾lestasis, sinusoidal dilatation, kupffer cell hyperplasia, and 
erythrophacocytosis [17]. This clinical and histological pic￾ture of chronic intrahepatic cholestasis was reported in one 
case in the studied group.
Abdominal ultrasound in patients with sickle cell ane￾mia may reveal gallstones and increased echogenicity of 
the liver and pancreas caused by iron deposition [11]. In our 
study group, gall stones were reported in 90 patients.
Liver biopsy findings have already been described in 
other studies [17-19], however, all of these previous studies 
included the description of liver biopsies performed during 
autopsy, the present study reports the findings of 27 liver bi￾opsies in living patients with chronic liver abnormality.
The histological findings reported reinforce our clini￾cal observation that chronic liver abnormalities seem to be a 
multifactorial, since liver biopsies revealed siderosis, viral￾related hepatitis, cholestasis and also vascular changes. In￾terestingly, siderosis at liver biopsy was noted in all patients 
with clinical hemosiderosis. Histopathological findings in 
our study were in accordance with previous reports [20-24] 
stating that intrasinusoidal sickling and Kupffer cell erythro￾phagocytosis, these were seen in almost all of our patients.
In conclusion, the clinical spectrum of SCD ranges 
from mild liver function test abnormalities in asymptomatic 
patients, to significant hepatic abnormalities with marked 
hyperbilirubinemia. Multiple factors may contribute to the 
etiology of the liver disease, including ischemia, transfusion 
related viral hepatitis, iron overload, and gallstones. SCD 
patients who present with increased liver enzyme activities, 
cholestatic jaundice and hypergammaglobulinemia, should 
be evaluated for autoimmune hepatitis as part of a full diag￾nostic workup. Continuous hepatic evaluation including pe￾riodical liver function tests, serological tests, ferritin levels 
and abdominal ultrasound should be performed. Initiation of 
specific therapy, if indicated, for viral hepatitis or iron over￾load, and ‘anti-sickling’ treatments, may prevent chronic 
hepatopathy in this population. Liver biopsy may be helpful 
for treatment decisions.
