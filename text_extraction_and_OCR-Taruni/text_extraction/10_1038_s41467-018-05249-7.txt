Dietary lipids favor the growth of the pathobiont Bilophila wadsworthia, but the relevance of
this expansion in metabolic syndrome pathogenesis is poorly understood. Here, we showed
that B. wadsworthia synergizes with high fat diet (HFD) to promote higher inflammation,
intestinal barrier dysfunction and bile acid dysmetabolism, leading to higher glucose
dysmetabolism and hepatic steatosis. Host-microbiota transcriptomics analysis reveal
pathways, particularly butanoate metabolism, which may underlie the metabolic effects
mediated by B. wadsworthia. Pharmacological suppression of B. wadsworthia-associated
inflammation demonstrate the bacterium’s intrinsic capacity to induce a negative impact on
glycemic control and hepatic function. Administration of the probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus
CNCM I-3690 limits B. wadsworthia-induced immune and metabolic impairment by limiting
its expansion, reducing inflammation and reinforcing intestinal barrier. Our results suggest
a new avenue for interventions against western diet-driven inflammatory and metabolic
diseases.

I
n the last three decades, the prevalence of obesity and asso￾ciated metabolic complications such as type 2 diabetes and
non-alcoholic fatty liver disease have significantly increased
worldwide and represent a major socio-economic burden1.
Hence, there is an increasing drive to understand factors that may
influence the development and progression of the metabolic
disease.
Different diets rapidly and reproducibly alter both the com￾position and function of the gut microbiota2. For instance,
over-representation of Bilophila wadsworthia, a Gram-negative
sulfite-reducing bacteria that is commonly recovered from patients
with appendicitis3,4, had been associated with animal based diets
and diets rich in fats2,5–7. At least in HFD setting, increased
production of taurine conjugated bile acids had been proposed to
underlie the expansion of B. wadsworthia5. The negative effect
of increased abundance of B. wadsworthia on intestinal inflam￾mation had been demonstrated, but despite its documented
association with dietary fats5,7, it remains unknown whether
B. wadsworthia imposes negative consequences on metabolic host
function. Interestingly, higher level of B. wadsworthia had been
similarly observed in individuals suffering from severe malnutri￾tion8. The mechanism by which a single bacterium can play a
pleiotropic role in myriad of diseases remained unclear, but diet
seemed to play a major role in driving microbial fitness9.
It has now been recognized that alterations in gut microbiota
composition and function seem to be one hallmark of metabolic
impairment;1 however, causal relationships that underlie these
processes are complex and are not yet fully understood. Never￾theless, the ability to access and reprogram the composition
and function of the gut microbiota make it an attractive
target for preventive or therapeutic intervention. Oral deliveries
of specific probiotics strains belonging to Lactobacillus and
Bifidobacterium species have shown to confer protective effects
against obesity and metabolic syndrome in animal models10.
Little is however known whether these beneficial bacteria directly
modulate microbiota function and composition, which in turn
limit disease progression.
Here, using a combination of host transcriptomics, metatran￾scriptomics, gnotobiotics and conventional mouse models, we
explored the ability of the pathobiont B. wadsworthia to thrive
under HFD setting (saturated animal-derived fat) and its ability
to modify host physiology and metabolism. Furthermore, we
investigated the capacity of the probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus
strain CNCM I-3690, previously demonstrated to have an anti￾inflammatory properties, protective effects against intestinal
barrier dysfunction and HFD-induced metabolic alterations in
mice, as well as able to induce a decrease of Desulfobrionaceae
family, on which B. wadsworthia belongs to10–12. We showed that
B. wadsworthia worsens the detrimental impact of HFD on host
metabolism, in inflammation dependent and independent man￾ners, and L. rhamnosus CNCM I-3690 was efficient in delimiting
some of the B. wadsworthia-associated metabolic and immune
impairments, suggesting that preventing B. wadsworthia’s
expansion may be a novel therapeutic strategy in both inflam￾matory and metabolic diseases.
Results
HFD promotes increased B. wadsworthia expansion in mice.
To confirm the effect of dietary fat on the host metabolic status,
mice were maintained on either control diet (CD) or high fat diet
enriched with milk-fat (HFD). In agreement with previous
results5,7, we observed significantly higher fecal B. wadsworthia
level in HFD-fed mice but the increase was only 3.7-fold higher
compared to CD-fed mice after 9 weeks of diet (Fig. 1a). This

result might reflect the low level of B. wadsworthia in our animal
facility. Nonetheless, mice on HFD had gained more than 20%
weight compared to CD-fed mice (Fig. 1b). Weight gain was
linked to an increased calorie intake (Supplementary Figure 1a).
HFD-fed mice further showed elevated fasting blood glucose
and insulin as well as homeostatic model assessment–insulin
resistance (HOMA-IR) compared to CD-fed controls (Fig. 1c,
Supplementary Figure 1b-c). Similarly, blood glucose clearance,
evaluated by oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), was altered,
characterized by higher baseline and peak glycaemia and sig￾nificantly upper area under the curve (AUC), in HFD-fed mice
(Supplementary Figure 1d-e). Finally, HFD-fed mice displayed
higher hepatic triglycerides compared to CD (Supplementary
Figure 1f).
To better determine whether higher density of B. wadsworthia
affects metabolic functions, B. wadsworthia was deliberately
given to the mice by intragastric gavage. This protocol induced
a higher and stable intestinal level of B. wadsworthia (Fig. 1d–f).
Interestingly, CD-fed mice gavaged with B. wadsworthia
similarly showed higher and stable level of B. wadsworthia but
B. wadsworthia fecal abundance was still significantly higher in
HFD-fed mice (Supplementary Figure 2). These results under￾scored that HFD is not necessary for B. wadsworthia to thrive in
the host intestine; however, it is essential for the sustained higher
levels of B. wadsworthia. We thus generated two animal models:
(1) mice harboring low B. wadsworthia (HFD) and (2) mice
harboring high-density levels of B. wadsworthia (HFDBw+).
Using these models, we were able to discriminate the relevance of
B. wadsworthia abundance in metabolic host function.
B. wadsworthia aggravates HFD-induced metabolic
impairments. To determine the consequence of B. wadsworthia
abundance on host metabolic status, metabolic parameters were
evaluated in mice after a period of HFD feeding. We did not
observe significant differences in weight gain between HFD mice
harboring low or high B. wadsworthia abundance (Fig. 2a).
Similarly, no significant differences in weekly food intake were
observed among HFD-fed groups (Supplementary Figure 3a).
Glucose clearance, as assessed by OGTT as well as insulin level
and HOMA-IR were not affected by increased B. wadsworthia
abundance in HFD-fed mice (Fig. 2b–d). However, HFDBw+ mice
showed higher fasting glucose compared to HFD group (Fig. 2e).
Furthermore, a strong positive correlation between fasting
glucose and B. wadsworthia load in the caecum was observed
(Fig. 2f).
Elevated serum liver enzymes, hepatic steatosis as well as
cholesterol levels are commonly observed in obese individuals13.

transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) were
observed in all HFD groups compared to CD-fed mice, but there
was no significant difference between HFD and HFDBw+ groups
(Supplementary Figure 3c–d). Similarly, all HFD-fed mice,
regardless of treatment, have significantly elevated levels of total
cholesterol and HDL in the plasma (Supplementary Figure 3e–f).
On the other hand, analysis of liver histology revealed that
hepatic lipid content was significantly increased in HFDBw+
group (Fig. 2g, h). In parallel, total hepatic triglyceride was
significantly higher in HFDBw+ group than HFD (Fig. 2i),
showing that B. wadsworthia has detrimental effects on this
metabolic feature. Taken together, these results showed that the
high abundance of B. wadsworthia potentiates specific HFD￾induced host metabolic syndrome, with notable dysregulation of
glucose homeostasis and liver function.
L. rhamnosus CNCM I-3690 prevents B. wadsworthia expan￾sion. Having established a robust murine model of HFD-driven
metabolic syndrome with stable and high levels of B. wadsworthia
and the consequence of B. wadsworthia abundance on metabolic
syndrome pathogenesis, we tested the therapeutic potential of
the L. rhamnosus CNCM I-3690 strain in this model. Daily
oral gavage of L. rhamnosus CNCM I-3690 (Lr) induced a sig￾nificant decrease in fecal B. wadsworthia load (Fig. 1a–c). Simi￾larly, L. rhamnosus CNCM I-3690 was able to further reduce
B. wadsworthia expansion in caecum and small intestine.
We then determined whether preventing B. wadsworthia
expansion by L. rhamnosus CNCM I-3690 has host metabolic
consequences. L. rhamnosus CNCM I-3690 did not affect weight
gain and food intake in HFD and in HFDBw+ mice (Fig. 2a;
Supplementary Figure 3a). L. rhamnosus treated HFDBw+ mice
(HFDBw+Lr+) showed reduced fasting glucose level, plasma
insulin and HOMA-IR response (Fig. 2d, e, Supplementary
Figure 3b). OGTT further revealed that HFDBw+Lr+ mice tended
(AUC of OGTT p = 0.0582) to control glucose level better than
HFDBw+ (Fig. 2b). L. rhamnosus CNCM I-3690 did not have
any effect on glycemic control in HFD group with lower
B. wadsworthia level (Supplementary Figure 4a, d–e) but it
corrected the effect of HFD on insulin level (Supplementary
Figure 4b), suggesting that in addition to suppressing B. wads￾worthia-related metabolic dysfunctions by preventing its expan￾sion in vivo, it also improves metabolic function by its inherent
ability to modulate insulin level.
HFD feeding modulates microbiota composition. HFD had
been consistently shown to modulate intestinal microbial
community; thus, we evaluated the global microbiota changes
induced by the HFD diet as well as the microbiota effect
of inoculating the mice with B. wadsworthia and L. rhamnosus
CNCM I-3690 using 16s rRNA-based high throughput
sequencing technique. Regardless of treatment, fecal microbiota
of CD group clustered differently from mice fed with HFD
(Fig. 3a), highlighting a dominant effect of diet (Anosim, 9999
permutations, p = 0.0001). Compared to CD, HFD-fed mice
had lower abundance of bacteria belonging to the genera
Ruminococcus, Bifidobacterium and Parabacteroides and of
Akkermansia muciniphila species (Fig. 3b, c). On the other
hand, higher abundance of bacteria under Dorea and Sutterella
genera and Ruminococcus gnavus species was observed in
HFD-fed mice. Inoculating mice with B. wadsworthia did not
induce major changes in microbiota composition in HFD-fed
mice (Fig. 3a), although an increase in abundance of Akker￾mansia and Bifidobacterium genera was observed in HFDBw+
group (Supplementary Figure 5a). Similarly, L. rhamnosus
CNCM I-3690, did not induce significant changes in microbiota
composition; however, as expected, an increase abundance in
an OTU related to L. rhamnosus was observed in HFDBw+Lr+
group (Supplementary Figure 5b). No significant differences in
alpha diversity were observed among groups as measured by
observed species, Chao1 and Shannon indexes (Fig. 3d and
Supplementary Figure 5c). Overall, these data showed that
HFD has a significant impact on microbiota composition but
the effect of B. wadsworthia and L. rhamnosus CNCM I-3690
on the microbiota composition, assessed by 16S-based
approach, was limited and may be more relevant at the meta￾bolic functional level.
B. wadsworthia modulates host and microbial transcriptomics.
To explore the interplay between B. wadsworthia, host metabo￾lism, gut microbiota and L. rhamnosus CNCM I-3690, we
chose to work in a controlled microbiota environment, that
is a gnotobiotic mice colonized with the eight species of the
so-called altered Schaedler flora (ASF)14. We further exploited
this system by conducting a comprehensive transcriptomic ana￾lysis on both the host and bacterial genes. Germ-free mice were
colonized with ASF, and then maintained on either CD or HFD.
ASF-colonized mice were then inoculated with B. wadsworthia
and treated with (HFD-ASFBw+Lr+) or without L. rhamnosus
CNCM I-3690 (HFD-ASFBw+). B. wadsworthia colonization
was confirmed by measuring B. wadsworthia density in the
caecum (Fig. 4a).
Host (caecum) transcriptomics analysis identified many
differentially regulated transcripts in HFD compared to CD
fed mice. In HFD-ASF mice, expression of 302 genes was
significantly altered compared to CD-ASF mice (Supplementary
data 1) whereas this number reached 1630 genes in HFD-ASFBw+
mice demonstrating stronger gene modulation. Compared to
HFD-ASF mice, HFD-ASFBw+ exhibited an activation in many
pathways involved in inflammation and immune response and
a marked alteration in fat and glucose metabolism and
regulation. Notably Type II diabetes mellitus and Insulin
signaling pathways were respectively over-activated and under￾activated (Fig. 4b, Supplementary data 2). These alterations
were largely reversed in HFD-ASFBw+Lr+ with correction of
most of the altered pathway activation seen in HFD-ASFBw+ mice
(Fig. 4b, Supplementary data 2). To confirm these results, we
measured cytokines at the protein level in mesenteric lymph
nodes (MLN), spleen and caecum and showed that, IFN-γ
and IL-6 production were consistently higher in tissues of
HFD-ASFBw+ mice compared to other groups and L. rhamnosus
CNCM I-3690 reversed this phenotype (Fig. 4c).
In parallel, we analyzed in the same animals the functional
activity of ASF microbiota, B. wadsworthia and L. rhamnosus
CNCM I-3690 using metatrancriptomics strategy and RNAseq
technology (Fig. 5a, and Supplementary data 3). The global
microbiota activity of HFD-ASF mice was dysregulated with
increased activity in sugar interconversions pathways and
decreased activity in nitrogen metabolism pathway. Microbial
gene expression in all HFD-fed mice colonized with
B. wadsworthia showed strong alteration with notably signifi￾cantly higher activation of Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) biosynth￾esis and Taurine metabolism pathways while many pathways
involving amino acid, sugar, starch, and nitrogen metabolism
were significantly reduced. To further evaluate whether the
increased LPS production at the microbiota expression level
have physiological relevance to the host, we measured serum
soluble CD14 (sCD14), a component of the LPS-sensing
machinery used as a surrogate marker for LPS concentration
in the periphery, and found significantly higher sCD14 in
HFD-ASFBw+ mice (Fig. 5b).

Finally, compared to other groups, only HFD-ASFBw+ mice
showed decreased activation of Butanoate (butyrate) metabolism
pathway, an alteration reverted in HFD-ASFBw+ treated with L.
rhamnosus CNCM I-3690. We further confirmed this last result
by measuring the fecal concentration of SCFA. A strong tendency
(p = 0.0593) for reduced butyrate concentration was observed in
HFD-ASFBw+ compared to HFD-ASF. Moreover, HFD-ASFBw+Lr+
mice showed significantly higher butyrate compared to HFD￾a

ASFBw+ (Fig. 5c). Interestingly, HFD-ASFBw+ also showed lower
fecal propionate concentration compared to HFD-ASFBw+Lr group
(Fig. 5d).
Taken together, these results showed that B. wadsworthia acts
on both host and microbiota by worsening HFD-induced
intestinal inflammation, inhibiting pathways involved in meta￾bolic homeostasis, favoring increased LPS production and
translocation, and decreasing butyrate production by the
microbiota. Most of these B. wadsworthia-associated alterations
were fully or partly reversed by L. rhamnosus CNCM I-3690
administration.
B. wadsworthia enhances HFD-induced bile acid dysmetabo￾lism. Our host transcriptomic data revealed that B. wadsworthia
modulates a number of genes involved in taurine metabolism,
which is linked with bile acid homeostasis. Bile acids are
increasingly recognized as important signaling factors and reg￾ulators of metabolism15,16. As such, we investigated the bile acid
profile of mice harboring complex microbiota. Indeed, we found
that HFD feeding leads to changes in bile acid composition in the
caecum; these alterations were characterized by significantly
higher total bile acids and elevated primary bile acids conjugates,
as opposed to secondary conjugates (Fig. 6a–c). Furthermore,

cecal bile acids of mice fed with HFD showed decreased pro￾portion of bile acids such as DCA and HDCA. B. wadsworthia
tends to further dysregulate bile acid composition in the caecum
with higher levels of taurocholic acid (TCA), a taurine-conjugated
bile acid, as well as other bile acids such as UDCA and MCA-β.
Furthermore, in the serum of HFD-fed mice, taurine conjugated
bile acid concentration was more than 100-fold higher compared
to CD, with an even stronger increase in HFDBw+ group (Fig. 6d,
e). In contrast, HFDBw+Lr+ showed lower total and taurine￾conjugated bile acids compared to HFDBw+, suggesting the
efficiency of L. rhamnosus CNCM I-3690 to reverse the effect of
HFD and B. wadsworthia on bile acids.
L. rhamnosus CNCM I-3690 reverts B. wadsworthia host dys￾function. Based on our simplified microbiota studies, the pre￾sence of B. wadsworthia downregulated the production of SCFA
and upregulated the global synthesis of LPS by the intestinal
microbial communities and was further associated with higher
systemic LPS. Guided by these results, we similarly assessed the
SCFA concentration in caecum and the LPS availability in the
systemic compartment in our HFD conventional mice model.
In accordance with the results obtained from ASF-colonized
mice, butyrate concentration tended to be lower in the caecum of
HFDBw+ than in HFD mice and L. rhamnosus CNCM I-3690
was associated with a higher level of butyrate and propionate
(Fig. 7a, b). Similarly, serum sCD14 level was significantly higher
in HFDBw+ than in HFD mice, but L. rhamnosus CNCM I-3690
did not reverse this phenotype (Fig. 7c).
Intestinal barrier dysfunction is an important feature in obesity
and metabolic syndrome17. We hypothesized that this parameter
may underlie the increased systemic bioavailability of LPS. Thus,
we assessed intestinal permeability using a classical permeability
marker FITC-dextran. HFDBw+ mice exhibited increased intest￾inal permeability as demonstrated by higher serum FITC-dextran
levels following oral gavage (Fig. 7d). Intestinal permeability
was dampened by L. rhamnosus CNCM I-3690 in HFDBw+ but
not HFD (Fig. 7d, Supplementary Figure 6a), suggesting this
phenotype is modulated by L. rhamnosus through regulation of
B. wadsworthia abundance. Overall, these results show that
the increased B. wadsworthia abundance augments the impact of
HFD-induced gut barrier alterations and L. rhamnosus CNCM I￾3690 partially reverse this effect.
Disruption of the gut barrier may allow increased intestinal
permeability to bacterial endotoxins, such as LPS, and in turn
may increase mucosal inflammation and lead to systemic
inflammation. Hence, we next examined whether B. wadsworthia
further exacerbates HFD-induced inflammatory response in
conventional mice. We first characterized the state of mucosal
inflammation by quantifying lipocalin-2 levels in the feces on
different time-points during the experiment (Fig. 7e). HFD
feeding tended to show higher levels of lipocalin-2 in the feces
compared to CD but this was further and significantly increased
in HFDBw+ mice, particularly at week 7 and 9. Cytokine levels
in MLN, ileum and jejunum of HFDBw+ were similarly higher
compared to either CD or HFD or both groups, underscoring a
state of heightened mucosal inflammation in HFDBw+ group
(Fig. 7f–h). L. rhamnosus CNCM I-3690 treatment was able to
dampen some of these responses, particularly for fecal lipocalin-2
levels, TNF-α and IFN-γ in HFDBw+ but not in HFD group
(Fig. 7e–h, Supplementary Figure 6b).
We further assessed the state of systemic inflammation and
observed a similar pattern with significantly increased production
of several pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IFN-γ, TNF-α and
IL-6 in the spleen and liver of HFDBw+ mice (Fig. 7i, j). Similar to
mucosal immune response, L. rhamnosus CNCM I-3690 treated
mice displayed a cytokine pattern closer to the control groups,
suggesting its ability to dampen the pro-inflammatory effect
of B. wadsworthia. All together, these results showed that
B. wadsworthia synergizes with HFD in inducing higher states
of systemic and mucosal inflammation, which can be at least
partly reversed by L. rhamnosus CNCM I-3690.
B. wadsworthia’s inflammation-independent modulating
properties. In accordance with previous study5, we observed that
B. wadsworthia possessed inherent pro-inflammatory properties;
however, it remains unknown at what extent this B. wadsworthia
feature plays a role in development of host metabolic impairment.
Inflammation is an important feature of metabolic syndrome;
consequently, it is also unclear whether B. wadsworthia-asso￾ciated metabolic impairments are just secondary to B. wads￾worthia-driven inflammation. To address these questions,
inflammation in HFD-fed mice was suppressed using a broadly
used immunosuppressant, ciclosporine. Cytokine analysis in
spleen, MLN and intestine as well as Lipocalin-2 level in stools
showed that ciclosporine (Ci) effectively abrogated the inflam￾matory response in HFD-fed mice, regardless whether they
harbor low or high-density B. wadsworthia (Fig. 8a, b; Supple￾mentary Figure 7a–c). Thus, by normalizing the inflammatory
state between the HFD-Ci and HFD-CiBw+, potential interference
of inflammation can be eliminated and direct metabolic effect
of B. wadsworthia can be clearly inferred.
No difference in B. wadsworthia density was observed between
ciclosporine treated and untreated HFDBw+, ruling out any direct
effect of ciclosporine treatment on B. wadsworthia (Fig. 8c).
Ciclosporine treated HFD and HFDBw+ mice showed signifi￾cantly less weight gain compared to non-treated mice, under￾scoring the importance of inflammation in promoting weight
gain (Fig. 8d). Regardless of weight change however, ciclosporine
did not affect fasting glucose, insulin and HOMA-IR in HFD-fed
mice (Fig. 8e–g). However, HFDBw+ mice treated with ciclos￾porine showed significantly elevated fasting insulin and this was
associated with a strong tendency (p = 0.0576) for higher HOMA
scores. OGTT further showed that ciclosporine-treated HFD-fed
mice tend to exhibit improved glucose tolerance compared to
non-treated mice; but HFDBw+ mice still had worse glucose
tolerance, as evidenced by higher glycemic level 15 min following
oral challenge and significantly higher AUC, compared to HFD
mice (Fig. 8h, i).
In terms of hepatic effect, ciclosporine did not seem to
significantly dampen hepatic steatosis in both HFD (Fig. 8j, k).
Although, there was a tendency (p = 0.0728) for HFD-CiBw+ to
have lower steatosis compared to HFDBw+ group. Nonetheless,
the difference in steatosis between HFD and HFDBw+ remains
significant regardless of ciclosporine treatment. Altogether, these
results showed that the pro-inflammatory effects of B. wads￾worthia partly mask its negative metabolic effects. Moreover,
B. wadsworthia exhibits negative intrinsic metabolic effect
independently of inflammation.
Discussion
HFD had been consistently associated with increased abundance
of B. wadsworthia, a bacterium implicated in increased colitis
severity of Il-10-/- mice5. However, the impact of B. wadsworthia
on non-genetically susceptible host, and whether and how its
expansion could promote an impaired metabolic function
remains poorly understood. Here, we utilized a hypothesis-driven
approach, using a combination of host trancriptomics, meta￾trancriptomics and gnotobiotic techniques, to dissect how
B. wadsworthia is able to modulate host metabolic response to
HFD. We then tested our hypotheses in conventional HFD

defect, systemic inflammation, bile acid dysmetabolism and
changes in microbiome functional profile, leading to the
worsening of HFD-induced metabolic effects. Moreover, we

To determine the mechanistic basis by which B. wadsworthia
impacts host metabolism and how L. rhamnosus CNCM I-3690
attenuates these effects, we performed transcriptomic analysis on
both the host and microbiota. To fully understand the system, we
chose to work in a controlled microbiota environment, wherein
bacterial and host function can be inferred to a specific microbe
or condition. Among the gene pathways that were significantly
modulated by the presence of B. wadsworthia are those involved
in bile acid metabolism. Bile acids are synthesized from choles￾terol. In the liver, taurine, along with glycine, are used to con￾jugate bile acids to produce primary bile acids. Bile acids undergo
enterohepatic circulation, which includes circulating in the
intestine where primary bile acids are further deconjugated and
converted into secondary bile acids by the microbiota. Saturated
animal-derived fats had been previously shown to promote the
production of taurine conjugated bile acids, such as taurocholic
acid (TCA)2,5. In this study, we observed that HFD significantly
upregulates intestinal genes involved in the metabolism of taurine
with increased concentration of taurine conjugated bile acids
and decreased proportion of secondary bile acids in the caecum.
B. wadsworthia further aggravates the bile acid deregulation in
HFD context and this can be alleviated by L. rhamnosus CNCM
I-3690 treatment. This is important as secondary bile acids have
an important negative feedback role in decreasing bile acid
synthesis;15 hence, the increased total serum and caecum bile
acids in HFDBw+ group may be compounded by the decreased
negative feedback signaling due to lower proportion of secondary
bile acids. Additionally, unlike conjugated bile acids, unconju￾gated bile acids, such as cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic
acid, are strong agonist for bile acid receptors, including Farne￾soid X receptor and transmembrane G protein-coupled recep￾tor;16 signaling through these receptors activates transcriptional
networks and signaling cascades relevant for cholesterol and
lipid metabolism, maintenance of glucose and hepatic home￾ostasis, as well as genes involved in suppressing inflammation
and strengthening intestinal barrier function15,18. Moreover,
the pro-inflammatory properties of primary bile acids had
been described19,20. Altogether, these data suggest that B. wads￾worthia’s impact on bile acid metabolism may be one mechanism
by which the bacterium potentiates HFD-induced metabolic
impairment and host dysfunctions, particularly inflammation and
barrier dysfunction.
How the presence of B. wadsworthia leads to a dispropor￾tionate level of bile acids remains an open question, but it is
possible that B. wadsworthia has an inherent ability to drive
the production of primary acid, particularly TCA, for its own
advantage. Indeed, it had been previously shown that B. wads￾worthia expands in the presence of taurine conjugated bile
acids, especially TCA5. Similarly, we observed that B. wads￾worthia grow in vitro ten times more in the presence of 1%
taurine (Supplementary Figure 8). Thus, in conjunction with
previous results, this suggests that taurine and its derivatives,
particularly TCA, may not be necessary for B. wadsworthia’s
survival but are essential for its increased fitness and growth.
Our metatranscriptomics studies revealed also that LPS
synthesis pathway was highly upregulated in HFDBw+ mice
microbiota. This was paralleled by higher LPS translocation,
which may at least partly explain the increased systemic inflam￾matory response we observed in HFDBw+, both in ASF-colonized
and conventional mice. L. rhamnosus CNCM I-3690 may be
reducing the pro-inflammatory phenotype in HFDBw+ mice
by decreasing the abundance of B. wadsworthia, and also by
decreasing the bioavailability of LPS in the systemic circulation
and/or through its intrinsic anti-inflammatory effects that had
been previously demonstrated in other murine models11.
Although L. rhamnosus CNCM I-3690 was efficient in decreasing
inflammatory markers and intestinal permeability in HFDBw+, it
was ineffective in decreasing these phenotypes in HFD mice,
highlighting that L. rhamnosus CNCM I-3690 acts through
B. wadsworthia modulation in this setting.
In addition to LPS synthesis, the presence of B. wadsworthia
induced a decreased expression of microbial genes involved in
butanoate metabolism in ASF-colonized mice. Furthermore, the
decreased production of butyrate was confirmed by dosage in
colon lumen of the mice. Aside from its effect in modulating
inflammatory response21, butyrate had been shown enhance
intestinal epithelial barrier by assembly of tight junctions22,23.
Furthermore, dietary supplementation with butyrate had been
previously shown to confer preventive and therapeutic benefits in
animal model of obesity and insulin resistance24. Interestingly, L.
rhamnosus strains had been shown to be efficient in compen￾sating butyrate deficiency and enhance intestinal barrier11,25,
thereby providing another potential mechanism of action of L.
rhamnosus.
We showed that B. wadsworthia increased HFD-induced
metabolic syndrome, which is a condition often associated with
low degree of systemic inflammation26. At the same time, B.
wadsworthia had been demonstrated to exacerbate intestinal
inflammation in genetically susceptible mice5 and also to induce
systemic inflammation in wild type animals27. Higher state of
inflammation is characterized by wasting and weight loss while
metabolic syndrome is characterized by low grade inflammation
and higher body mass index. Thus, a key question is how can
B. wadworthia affect both opposing pathologies. Moreover, the
contribution and relative importance of B. wadworthia’s pro￾inflammatory properties in disturbing host metabolic status in
HFD setting is unknown. By pharmacologically suppressing the
inflammation, we unmasked the capacity of B. wadsworthia to
directly induce a negative impact on host metabolic function.
Specifically, we were able to discriminate distinct metabolic
impairments, namely reduced glucose clearance and fatty liver
phenotype, influenced by B. wadworthia that do not completely
rely on its pro-inflammatory properties. Nonetheless, B. wad￾worthia-driven inflammation remains an important factor that
further tip the balance to stronger metabolic dysfunctions.
Accordingly, this may explain why B. wadworthia is able to
play a pathological role on two contrasting settings. It is also
important to note that although we showed in this study that
B. wadsworthia promoted heightened immune response, this did
not translate to patent colitis development compared to previous
reports5. This might be due to the fact that our murine model
is not a genetically susceptible host, and therefore have
intact compensatory mechanism that prevents the development
of overt intestinal inflammation. Hence, B. wadsworthia’s effect
on metabolic function in our system outweighs its effect on
development of overt inflammation due to lack of additional
stimuli. As a result, the phenotype we achieved is a model by
which B. wadsworthia potentiates the deleterious effect of HFD
on host metabolic homeostasis. Taken all together, the effect of
B. wadsworthia to the host can be pleiotropic, but the combina￾tion of genetics, host and environmental factors ultimately
dictate the degree of inflammation and type of pathologies
B. wadworthia will exacerbate or influence.
Overall, we demonstrated that B. wadworthia augments some
of the deleterious host metabolic effects of HFD by modifying
multiple targets: altering the functional potential of intestinal
microbes, promoting higher intestinal permeability, development
of heightened immune response both at mucosal and systemic
level, and disproportionate bile acid concentrations. All these
pathways ultimately converge to further disturb the host meta￾bolic function in HFD setting (Supplementary Figure 8).
Importantly, we also unraveled that B. wadsworthia, independent

of its pro-inflammatory properties, has the capacity to negatively
affect glucose and hepatic homeostasis. These results suggest that
the carriage of high levels of Bilophila species or strains might
modulate the susceptibility to not only inflammatory but also
metabolic diseases. Collectively, our study provides a conceptual
framework to further test this hypothesis in human and warrants
the evaluation of preventative strategies, such as probiotics use,
to suppress the expansion of Bilophila.
Methods
Experimental model. For conventional experiment, male C57BL/6J mice were
purchased from Janvier (France) and used after 1 week of receipt. Mice at 5 weeks
of age were fed ad libitum with purified control diet (CD, Envigo TD.120508) or
high fat diet (HFD, 38% fat, dominantly milk fat, Envigo TD.97222) for 9 weeks.
For deliberate B. wadsworthia inoculation, after maintaining the mice in HFD or
CD for 2 weeks, mice were inoculated via oral gavage with ~107 CFU of B.
wadsworthia ATCC 49260 suspended in 200 μl of medium (Bacteroides bile esculin
with 1% Taurine and 0.5 mg/ml cysteine) or medium alone for three consecutive
days. For L. rhamnosus CNCM I-3690 treatment, 1 week after the last B. wads￾worthia inoculation, mice were gavaged daily with 109 CFU of L. rhamnosus
CNCM I-3690 suspended in 200 μl of vehicle (phosphate buffer saline with 15%
glycerol) or vehicle for 5 weeks. For ciclosporine experiment, 1 week after the last
B. wadsworthia inoculation, mice were injected i.p. with ciclosporine (25 mg/kg;
Sandimmum Novartis) or vehicle (PBS) 3x a week for 5 weeks.
For altered Schaedler flora (ASF) experiment, male C57BL/6J germ-free (GF)
mice were obtained from Transgenese et Archivage Animaux Modeles (CNRS,
UPS44, Orleans, France) and used after 1 week of receipt. Sterility was confirmed
microscopically and by microbiological technique. ASF colonized mice were kindly
provided by E. Verdu from McMaster University (Canada). Fresh cecal samples
from ASF-colonized mice were suspended and diluted in pre-reduced sterile 0.9%
NaCl with 15% glycerol (1 g in 10 ml) under anaerobic condition. Aliquots of ASF
cecal suspension were stored at −80 °C. GF mice (5 weeks of age) were inoculated
via oral gavage with 200 μl of ASF cecal suspension and maintained on either HFD
or CD. 3 weeks after ASF inoculation, mice were orally gavaged with B.
wadsworthia or medium for 3 consecutive days. 1 week after the last B.
wadsworthia inoculation, mice were gavaged daily with 109 CFU of L. rhamnosus
CNCM I-3690 or vehicle for 4 weeks. ASF mice were housed in isolator for the
whole experiment.
Weekly food consumption was measured cage-wise. Mice were fasted for 6 h
prior to sacrifice and then put to sleep using isoflurane. Mice were culled by
cervical dislocation and appropriate tissues were harvested. All experiments were
performed in accordance with the French animal experimental committee (Comite
d’Ethique en Experimentation Animale).
Oral glucose tolerance test. Oral glucose tolerance test was performed 3–5 days
before the sacrifice. Mice were fasted by removing the food and bedding 1 h before
the onset of light cycle. After 6 h of fasting, glucose solution (2 g/kg) was admi￾nistered by oral gavage. Blood glucose level at time 0 (fasting glucose, taken before
glucose gavage) and at 15, 30, 60, and 120 min after glucose gavage was analyzed
using OneTouch glucometer (Roche). Glucose level was plotted against time and
areas under the glucose curve (AUC) were calculated by following trapezoidal rule.
Plasma insulin concentration (collected in EDTA-coated tubes) at time 0 (fasting
insulin) and 30 was analyzed from tail vein blood (collected in EDTA-coated tubes)
using ultra sensitive mouse insulin ELISA kit (Alpco). Homeostatic model
assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) was calculated according to the for￾mula: fasting glucose (nmol/L) x fasting insulin (microU/L)/22.5.
Measurements of plasma parameters. Blood samples were collected in heparin￾coated tubes via cardiac puncture, centrifuged and then plasma samples were
stored at −80 °C. Plasma cholesterol, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein (HDL),
aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) measurement were
performed by the Biochemistry Platform (CRI, UMR 1149, Paris) using Olympus
AU400 Chemistry Analyzer.
Measurements of bile acids. Measurement of bile acids (BA) composition and
concentration in plasma and intestinal contents was performed by the Chemistry
department at Saint Antoine Hospital (UMR 7203, France) using high performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC, Agilent 1100, France) coupled in series with mass
spectrometer (QTRAP 2000, Canada)20.
Measurements of SCFA. Measurement of the short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) from
fecal content was performed by the mass spectrometer platform at Universite de
Nantes (IRS-UN, France) using gas chromatography coupled with mass
spectrometry28.
Quantification of cytokines. Single cell suspensions from MLN and spleen
were isolated by smashing the cells in 70 μm mesh. 1 × 106 cells were plated
in 24 well-plate and then stimulated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA,
50 ng/mL; Sigma-Aldrich) and ionomycin (1 µM; Sigma Aldrich) for 48 h at 37 °C.
Supernatants were collected and used for cytokine analysis.
Fifty milligram of intestinal tissues and liver samples were suspended in T-PER
Tissue Protein Extraction Reagent (Thermo Scientific) and homogenized suing
FastPrep (6 m/s in 40 s). Homogenates were centrifuged and supernatants were
used for cytokine and total protein concentration analysis. Total protein
concentration of the tissue homogenates were analyzed using Pierce BCA Protein
Assay Kit (Thermo Scientific). Cytokine concentrations were normalized according
to the measured protein concentration.
Cytokines were measured using Legendplex Mouse Inflammation Panel
(Biolegend) or individual ELISA kit (R&D Mouse DuoSet IL-6; Mabtech IFN-γ,
IL-17a ELISA kits; Ebioscience TNF-α ELISA kit).
Liver histology and hepatic triglycerides measurement. A slice of left lobe of the
liver was fixed in 4% PFA for 48 h and then transferred to ethanol, fixed in paraffin,
trimmed, processed, sectioned into slices approximately 3 μm thick, mounted on a
glass slide and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). Hepatic lipids were
evaluated by quantifying the % lipid area using the software ImageJ29.
In vivo intestinal permeability and plasma sCD14. In vivo assay of intestinal
barrier function was performed using fluorescein-conjugated dextran (FITC￾dextran, 3–5kDA) method, as previously described30. Briefly, on the day of
sacrifice, FITC-dextran (0.6 mg/g of body weight) was administered to the mice by
oral gavage and 3 h later, blood samples were collected in heparin-coated tubes.
Fluorescence intensity was measured in the plasma using a microplate reader
(Tecan). Plasma concentration of soluble CD14 (sCD14) was measured using
CD14 ELISA kit (R&D).
Quantification of fecal LCN2. Frozen fecal samples were weighed and
reconstituted in cold PBS. Samples were then agitated on a FastPrep bead beater
machine for 40 s at setting 6 using 4.5 mm glass beads to obtain homogenous fecal
suspension. Samples were then centrifuged for 5 min at 10,000×g (4 °C) and clear
supernatants were collected and stored at −20 °C until analysis. LCN2 levels were
estimated using Duoset murine LCN2 Elisa Kit (R&D) as per manufacturer’s
instructions and expressed as pg/mg of stool.
DNA extraction and bacterial quantification. Fecal, cecal and small intestinal
content genomic DNA was extracted from the weighted stool samples using a
method that was previously described31, which is based on the Godon DNA
extraction method. Quantifications of all bacteria and B. wadsworthia were per￾formed by qPCR using TaqMan Gene Expression Assays (Life technologies) and
Takyon SYBR Green PCR kit (Eurogentec). All bacteria was quantified using the
following oligonucleotides: (sense) 5′-CGGTGAATACGTTCCCGG-3′ and (anti￾sense) 5′-TACGGCTACCTTGTTACGACTT-3′ and (probe) 5′-CTTGTACACAC
CGCCCGTC-3′. B. wadsworthia was quantified using specific primers for the tpa
gene (accession no. AF269146): (sense) 5′-CGCCGGTATCGAAATCGTGA-3′ and
(antisense) 5′-ATTCGCGGAAGGAGCGAGAG-3′. Sulfite-reducing bacteria were
quantified using specific primers for the dsra gene (encoding a dissimilatory sulfite
reductase alpha subunit) as described by Devkota5.
16s rRNA gene sequencing. 16s rRNA gene sequencing of fecal DNA samples
(collected at week 9 of CD or HFD) was performed as previously described31.
Briefly, the V3-V4 region was amplified and sequencing was done using an
Illumina MiSeq platform (Illumina). Sequencing data were analyzed using the
quantitative insights into microbial ecology (QIIME 1.9.1) software package.
Sequences were clustered into operational taxonomic unites (OTU) at a 97%
identity threshold using a closed-reference picking approach with UCLUST against
the Greengenes reference database (version 13.5) and phylogenetic tree was built
using FastTree. Rarefaction was performed (13,000 sequences per sample) and used
to compare abundance of OTUs across samples. Alpha-diversity was estimated
using both richness and evenness indexes (Chao1, Shannon or number of observed
species). Beta-diversity was measured Bray Curtis distance matrix and was used
to build principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) plots. Linear discriminant analysis
(LDA) effect size (LEfSe) algorithm was used to identify taxa that are specific to
diet and/or treatment. Sequencing data are deposited in European Nucleotide
Archive (ENA) under the accession number PRJEB25364.
Mouse gene expression and microarray analysis. Total RNA was isolated from
the caecum of ASF-colonized mice using RNeasy Mini Kit, according to
manufacturer’s instructions. The RNA integrity was verified in Bioanalyzer 2100
with RNA 6000 Nano chips (Agilent Technologies). Only samples that have RNA
integrity >9 were used for the study. Mouse transcriptomics was performed
using SurePrint G3 Mouse GE 8x60K Microarray (Design ID: 028005, Agilent
Technologies), according to manufacturer’s instructions. Microarray data are

Microarray data processing and analysis was performed as previously
described28. Briefly, Agilent Feature Extraction Software v10.7.3.1 was used to
convert scanned signal into tab-delimited text files. p-value for each probe in each
array was computed to test whether the scanned signal is significantly higher than
background signal. Probes were filtered according to two criteria: only probes with
p-value lower than 0.05 were considered and present in at least 60% of arrays in
at last one biological groups. Signals were then log2 transformed, normalized
according to quantiles method, corrected for batch effect using ComBat method32
with covariate and Agilent’s probes ID were mapped to EntrezGeneID for further
analysis. Differential analysis was performed using empirical Bayesian test (eBayes).
Beside of analyzing of significant differentially expressed genes, we applied the
functional class scoring (FCS) method “Pathway Level Analysis of Gene Expression
(PLAGE, embedded in the GSVA R package)”33 to quantify the level of activity of
each KEGG pathway in each sample and utilized empirical Bayes test to compare
for the differentially enrichment between biological groups. Significant terms were
selected at Benjamini-Hochberg’s method corrected p-value lower than 0.05.
Microbial gene expression and RNA-sequencing analysis. Total bacterial RNA
from cecal content was extracted by mechanic bead-beating lysis method combined
with phenol/choloroform RNA extraction method. Briefly, cecal content was sus￾pended in 200 μl of RNAse free water and then 250 μl phenol (pH 4.8)/chloroform￾isoamyalcohol mixture (5:1 ratio), 12.5 μl of SDS (20%), 25 μl NaAc (3 M, pH 8)
were added to the suspension. Cecal content suspension was then agitated on a
FastPrep bead beater machine for 40 s at setting 5 followed by 60 s in ice for
another round of bead beating for 20 s at setting 5. After lysis, the upper phase of
the suspension was collected after 15 min of centrifugation at 13,000×g (4 °C).
Traces of phenol were eliminated by adding 250 μl of chloroforme-isoamylalchohol
and then collecting the upper phase after 10 min of centrifugation. Bacterial RNA
was then purified using High Pure RNA Isolation Kit (Roche), as per manu￾facturer’s instructions. Total RNA concentration and integrity was determined
using a Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent).
Library preparation and RNA-sequencing was performed by the High￾throughput Sequencing Platform of I2BC. Total bacterial RNA were purified using
RiboZero. Library was sequenced using NextSeq 500 on the single lane 75 bp
paired-end mode.
Metatranscriptomics data processing and analysis was performed by first
trimming unmapped reads and then were aligned using Bowtie2 aligner34 to
genome sequences retrieved form NCBI RefSeq database except for L. rhamnosus
CNCM I-3690, which was mapped using a genome generated from Danone
Nutricia. Mapped reads was quality filtered and only reads with MAPQ ≥ 5 was
used. Reads were counted against transcript features database (General Feature
Format (GFF) files from NCBI RefSeq database except for L. rhamnosus CNCM I￾3690 which was predicted using Prokka v1.12b) using the mode “union”. Count
data was further filtered using the following criteria: genes with 0 read across all
samples and genes with <1 count per million were excluded. For visualization,
count data was transformed using Variance Modeling at the Observation Level
(voom method)35 and then normalized by quantile method. Differential analysis
was performed using the exact tests for differences between two groups of negative
binomial counts programmed in the R package “edgeR”36. All the significant
signatures (up-regulated or down-regulated genes) were annotated for enriched
pathways using the package GOstats37. Pathway definition for bacteria was
downloaded from PATRIC database. Pathway lists were cleaned to exclude host
pathways that were predicted from the same enzyme commission numbers (EC)
assigned to both bacteria and host genes. As for host microarray, the method
PLAGE was used to compare the pathway activity level between groups. p-values
were adjusted using Benjamini-Hochberg’s method to correct for multiple-testing
problem. Significant threshold is fixed at alpha = 0.05 (type 1 error). All
metatranscriptomics were deposited on GEO repository under the accession
number GSE112387 [https://www-ncbi-nlm-nih-gov.gate2.inist.fr/geo/query/acc.
cgi?acc=GSE112387].
Statistical analysis. In each experiment, multiple mice were analyze as biological
replicates. No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size. Sample
size was estimated according to previous experience using the models described.
No samples, mice or data points were excluded from the reported analysis. Animals
were randomly assigned to each experimental groups. All analyses were performed
unblinded except the histological analyses. Dot plots with a linear scale show the
arithmetic mean. Bar graphs are expressed as mean ± standard error of mean
(SEM). Except for 16s rRNA, microarray and RNA-sequencing results, GraphPad
Prism version 7.0b was used for all statistical analysis. The Kolmogorov–Smirnov
test was used to verify that all data set were normally distributed. For data sets that
failed normality, nonparametric tests were used to analyze statistical differences.
For comparisons between two groups, significance was determined using two-tailed
Student’s t-test or nonparametric Mann–Whitney test. For comparisons among
more than two groups, one way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by post￾hoc Bonferroni test or nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test followed by post hoc
Dunn’s test and two-way ANOVA corrected for multiple comparison with a
Bonferroni test were used. An F or Bartlett’s test was performed to determine
difference in variances for t-tests and ANOVAs, respectively. An unpaired
Student’s t-test with Welch’s correction was applied when variances were not equal.
Differences were noted as significant at p ≤ 0.05.
Data availability. Sequencing data are deposited in European Nucleotide Archive
(ENA) under the accession number PRJEB25364. Microarray data are deposited in
GEO under the accession number GSE111451. All metatranscriptomics were
deposited on GEO repository under the accession number GSE112387. All other
data are available from authors.
