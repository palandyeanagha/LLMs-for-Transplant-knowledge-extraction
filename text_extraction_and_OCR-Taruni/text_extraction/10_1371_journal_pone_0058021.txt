Abstract
Polyomaviruses are small, non-enveloped viruses with a circular double-stranded DNA genome. Using a generic
polyomavirus PCR targeting the VP1 major structural protein gene, a novel polyomavirus was initially identified in resected
human liver tissue and provisionally named Human Polyomavirus 12 (HPyV12). Its 5033 bp genome is predicted to encode
large and small T antigens and the 3 structural proteins VP1, VP2 and VP3. Phylogenetic analyses did not reveal a close
relationship to any known human or animal polyomavirus. Investigation of organs, body fluids and excretions of diseased
individuals and healthy subjects with both HPyV12-specific nested PCR and quantitative real-time PCR revealed additional
virus-positive samples of resected liver, cecum and rectum tissues and a positive fecal sample. A capsomer-based IgG ELISA
was established using the major capsid protein VP1 of HPyV12. Seroprevalences of 23% and 17%, respectively, were
determined in sera from healthy adults and adolescents and a pediatric group of children. These data indicate that the virus
naturally infects humans and that primary infection may already occur in childhood.

Introduction
Polyomaviruses are small non-enveloped viruses with a circular
double-stranded DNA genome. They usually cause asymptomatic
primary infections, and persist in the body throughout life [1].
Seroprevalence studies have revealed that most primary infections
occur in childhood and that the majority of healthy adults had
contact to one or more polyomaviruses [2–5]. In immunocom￾promised individuals, polyomavirus reactivation can be associated
with clinical disease, i.e., JCPyV with progressive multifocal
leukoencephalopathy, BKPyV with nephropathy and cystitis (both
reviewed in: [6,7]), MCPyV with Merkel cell carcinoma [8], and
TSPyV with Trichodysplasia spinulosa [9]. For the other human
polyomaviruses known to date (KIPyV, WUPyV, HPyV6,
HPyV7, HPyV9, MWPyV/HPyV10/MXPyV and STLPyV
[10–17]) no associations with pathologic conditions have been
found. BKPyV and JCPyV persist in the kidney [1], and MCPyV,
HPyV6, HPyV7 and TSPyV are members of the skin microbiome
and/or are detected in skin diseases ([8,9,12,15,18]; reviewed in:
[19]). The tropism of the other human polyomaviruses is largely
unknown.
Most human polyomaviruses were discovered by examining
body fluids, se- and excretions [10–14,16,20]. In the present study
we performed a search for yet unknown human polyomaviruses
with generic PCR and focused on organs of the gastrointestinal
tract since a number of human polyomaviruses had been detected
in feces and sewage water [10,16,21–29]. In addition, spleens and
lymph nodes were tested, since JCPyV, MCPyV, and MCPyV￾related chimpanzee polyomaviruses had been reported to be
present in these organs [30–32]. Of the known human poly￾omaviruses, only MCPyV and TSPyV were detected in the
investigated organs. However, in resected liver, a novel poly￾omavirus was discovered.
Methods
Ethic statement
The study protocol for collection of gastrointestinal organ
samples was approved by the local ethics committee of the
Charite´ - Universita¨tsmedizin Berlin. Written informed consent
was obtained from study participants. The ethics committee
approved this consent procedure. Residual anonymized material
from spleen and lymph node samples was collected from deceased
individuals who donated organs for transplantation. Informed
verbal consent for organ donation was obtained from the next of
kin and documented by the responsible physician. The anon￾ymized collection of residual materials was approved by the local
ethics committee of the Charite´ - Universita¨tsmedizin Berlin. All
samples of body fluids and excretions were residual materials from
anonymized specimens originally submitted for routine diagnos￾tics. Additionally, retain samples from anonymized blood donors
collected after the retention period were used in this study. All
procedures were in accordance with the ethical standards of the

responsible committee on human experimentation and with the
Helsinki Declaration.
Sample collection
For PCR purposes, spleen (n = 61) and lymph node (n = 22)
specimens were provided by the German Foundation for Organ
Transplants (Deutsche Stiftung Organtransplantation, DSO),
Frankfurt am Main, Germany. Liver (n = 124), gall bladder
(n = 21), esophagus (n = 2), stomach (cardia; n = 2), colon (n = 4)
and rectum specimens (n = 6) were collected at the clinic of
general, visceral and transplantation surgery of the Charite´, Berlin,
Germany. Serum, plasma, urine, fecal, bronchoalveolar lavage
and cerebrospinal fluid samples were taken from the panel that
had been previously collected in Germany and analyzed for the
presence of HPyV9 [11]. Oral fluids (n = 30) were collected from
patients with suspected but not confirmed measles virus infection
in Germany. Native tissue samples were kept frozen at 280uC and
liquid samples at 220uC.
For ELISA, serum samples from healthy adolescents and adults
(age 16 to 72 years; n = 299) and from pediatric patients (age 2–11
years; n = 74) were used that had been collected previously for the
determination of HPyV9 seroprevalence [33].
DNA extraction and PCR methods
DNA was extracted, purified and generic polyomavirus PCR
was carried out as described previously [11,32]. To obtain
additional sequence information of the novel polyomavirus, a
950 bp genome fragment was amplified with nested PCR using
two degenerate sense primers targeting the VP3 gene of
polyomaviruses [11] and two virus-specific antisense primers
derived from the novel VP1 sequence (primers listed in Table S1;
PCR conditions in Table S2). From the resulting sequence, tail-to￾tail primers were derived and used in nested long-distance (LD)
PCR for the amplification and sequencing of the remaining part of
the virus genome (Tables S1 and S2). For diagnostic detection of
the novel polyomavirus, specific nested PCR primers were selected
(Table S1) and used under the conditions described in Table S2.
For specific quantitative PCR (qPCR), targeting a 139 bp
sequence of the VP1 gene, a sense primer (59- GTG￾GGAAGCTGTCAGTGTGA), an antisense primer (59- CCACC￾TACTGCAAACATGTG) and a TaqMan probe (FAM-ACTA￾CAGGATGGCCTACCCCATTGTCAGTC-TAMRA) were
selected. Five ml of DNA from fluid samples and 250 ng of DNA
from tissue samples were analyzed in a 96-well plate format. The
PCR was performed in a total volume of 25 ml with 2 U Platinum
Taq DNA polymerase (Life Technologies, Darmstadt, Germany),
400 nM of each primer, 150 nM probe, 800 mM dNTP PCR Mix
(Metabion, Martinsried, Germany) and 4.5 mM MgCl2. An MX
3000P (Stratagene, Waldbronn, Germany) was used with the
following cycling conditions: 95uC for 5 min and 45 cycles of 95uC
for 15 sec, followed by 59uC for 30 sec. Analysis was performed
using the MXPro3000P V 4.10 software (Stratagene).
Genome annotation
Open reading frames (ORFs) were predicted using Geneious
Pro 5.5.7 software. The region encoding the large T and small T
antigens (LTAg; STAg) was scanned for splice sites using
MacVector 12 software. Conserved motifs in all ORFs were
identified using the EMBOSS Needle-Pairwise Sequence Align￾ment (Rice et al., 2000). Putative binding sites of transcription
factors were predicted using Alggen PROMO software [34,35].
Amino acid percentage identities were calculated, and palin￾dromes in the NCCR were identified using the EMBOSS Needle￾Pairwise Sequence Alignment [36].
Phylogenetic analysis
VP1, VP2 and LTAg protein alignments comprising represen￾tative sequences from all polyomaviruses currently recognized as
species by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses
(ICTV; [37]) or recently reported to likely account for novel
species (e.g., MWPyV; [10]) were computed and used for
phylogenetic analyses (Table S3). These datasets notably included
10 non-human polyomaviruses whose genomes were recently
sequenced in our laboratory and which will be the subject of a
separate publication. Phylogenetic analyses were performed using
a workflow described previously [32], which ended up with
maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian tree reconstruction. The
three coding sequences were processed and analyzed individually.
It should be noted that during the revision process of this
manuscript, novel polyomaviruses were identified (e.g. STLPyV).
None, however, was closely related to the novel human
polyomavirus described in this study (data not shown). It is
therefore not expected that their inclusion would affect its
phylogenetic placement.
Expression and purification of recombinant VP1 proteins
The major capsid proteins VP1 genes of HPyV12 and the avian
polyomavirus APyV (former name: BFDPyV) were expressed as
described previously [33]. In brief, the VP1 sequences were codon￾optimized, commercially synthesized (MrGene GmbH, Regens￾burg, Germany) and inserted into a pTriEx-1.1 plasmid that
generates VP1 constructs tagged with a 6x His-tag at the N￾terminus. After transformation and expression in E. coli Rosetta
(DE3)pLacITM cells (Novagen, San Diego, USA), insoluble
recombinant proteins were obtained in inclusion bodies and
purified with BugBuster Protein Extraction Reagent (Novagen)
after lysis of cells and inclusion bodies with rLysozymeTM
(Novagen). Purification of VP1 from other E. coli proteins was
done under denaturing conditions with 8 M urea (Roth,
Karlsruhe, Germany) using HIS-SelectH Nickel Affinity Gel
(Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, USA). Native conformation of the
VP1 proteins was reconstituted by removing urea by dialysis.
Purity of proteins was analyzed with SDS–PAGE and Western
Blot using an anti-His monoclonal antibody (Sigma-Aldrich, St.
Louis, USA). Protein concentration was determined with a Pierce
BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, USA).
ELISA and statistical analysis
To detect antibodies with reactivity to HPyV12 VP1, an ELISA
was performed as described earlier [33]. F96 maxisorp immuno
plates (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) were incubated with purified
VP1 (50 ng per well) in PBS (pH 7.2) for 1 h at 37uC. Plates were
washed 3x with 800 ml PBS/0.05% Tween (PBS-T). To inhibit
non-specific binding 200 ml blocking buffer (PBS-T with 5% milk
powder) per well was added and incubated for 2 h at 37uC.
Human sera were diluted 1:200 and allowed to react with the
antigen-coated wells for 1 h at 37uC. Plates were washed 3x with
800 ml PBS-T and a HRPO-conjugated, secondary rabbit anti￾human IgG antibody (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany), diluted
1:10,000, was added to detect IgG antibodies. After an additional
washing step (3x with 800 ml PBS-T), peroxidase substrate TMB
(tetramethylbenzidene, Taastrup, Denmark) was added for 10 min
at room temperature in the dark. The reactions were stopped with
2NH2SO4. Optical density was measured on a microplate
spectrometer (BMG Labtech, Offenburg, Germany) at
l = 450 nm. All blank wells had absorbance values,0.1. The
data were analyzed with the X2-test to estimate significance of
differences among independent groups of individuals. For each
ELISA plate, a fixed set of sera was used to control for interserial

variations. The cut-off value (COV) for the ELISA was
determined experimentally. The background reactivities detected
in wells without antigen coating and those without both antigen
and serum (blanks) were subtracted from the ODs measured in
VP1-coated wells. The COV defining a positive serologic response
was defined as the mean of all negative ODs plus standard
deviation (COV HPyV12: OD450= 0.086). To further ensure that
the final OD450 values for HPyV12 VP1 were not in part derived
from unspecific antibody binding, reactivity of the sera to VP1 of
an avian polyomavirus (APyV) was measured (Mean
OD450= 0.07), and the values obtained for each serum were
subtracted from the ODs measured for HPyV12 VP1.
Nucleotides sequence accession numbers
The annotated, complete genome sequence of HPyV12 has
been submitted to GenBank (accession number JX308829). The
Genbank accession numbers of PyV genomes that were used in
phylogenetic analysis are listed in Table S3.
Results
Identification of HPyV12 and complete genome
sequencing
Organs of the gastrointestinal tract (liver, gall bladder,
esophagus, stomach, colon, rectum; n = 159) as well as spleen
(n = 61) and lymph node (n = 22) specimens were tested with
generic polyomavirus PCR targeting the VP1 gene (Table 1). In
13/242 PCR assays, fragments of the expected size were obtained,
purified and sequenced. BLAST analysis [38] revealed that 8 of
the 13 sequences originated from MCPyV (detected in 3 livers, 3
spleens, and 2 lymph nodes) and 1 from TSPyV (detected in a
lymph node). Most importantly, an unknown polyomavirus
sequence was amplified from liver specimens of 4 individuals,
revealing a relatively low level of identity to all human and
nonhuman polyomaviruses (pairwise amino acid identities: 51–
67%). The complete genome sequence was then generated from a
liver specimen with VP3/VP1-PCR and LD-PCR as described in
the Methods section. After sequencing all products, a final circular
genome of 5033 bp was obtained. Since 11 phylogenetically
distinct polyomaviruses of human origin are known at present, the
virus from which the sequence originated was tentatively named
Human Polyomavirus 12 (HPyV12).
Analysis of the HPyV12 genome
Analysis of the HPyV12 genome for putative open reading
frames (ORFs) revealed a genome structure typical for poly￾omaviruses. It includes an early region encoding regulatory
proteins (STAg and LTAg) and a late region encoding structural
proteins (VP1, VP2 and VP3) that are separated by a non-coding
control region (NCCR) (Figure 1). An ORF encoding for the
auxiliary agnoprotein [39] was not identified. The ORF locations
on the viral genome, the encoded proteins and their percentages of
identity to other human polyomaviruses are listed in Table 2.
HPyV12 LTAg and STAg share 71 amino acid residues that are
encoded at the N-terminus. This region contains the DnaJ domain
HPDKGG which is fully conserved between all known human

polyomaviruses identified so far [40]. However, HPyV12 LTAg
lacks the retinoblastoma binding motif LxCxE which is present in
LTAg sequences of all known human polyomaviruses. There is a
putative ATPase domain in the C-terminal part of the protein.
This domain consists of the conserved GPxxxGKT (GPINSGKT;
residues 498–505 in HPyV12 LTAg) and GxxxVNLE
(GSVTVNLE; residues 576–583 in HPyV12 LTAg). HPyV12
LTAg also has a Lys-rich sequence (PKSKKAK; residues 205–
211) which may act as a nuclear localization signal. A Cys-rich
sequence (Cx7CxCX2Cx22CxCx2Cx3WFG) which has been
shown to be required for binding of protein phosphatase PP2A
by STAgs of other polyomaviruses, is conserved in HPyV12 STAg

Figure 2. Phylogenetic analysis of HPyV12. A Bayesian chronogram was deduced from the analysis of a 488 amino acid alignment of LTAg
sequences. Polyomaviruses identified from human hosts are in red, from apes in blue. The human polyomaviruses MXPyV and the US strain of
MWPyV have the same phylogenetic position as HPyV10 and are not shown. The sequence of the very recently discovered human STLPyV which is
most closely related to HPyV10, MWPyV and MXPyV, became only available at the end of the revision process of this manuscript; it was therefore not
included in the datasets put together for the present study. Statistical support for branches is given as posterior probability/bootstrap. For three
branches defining potentially meaningful bipartitions (with respect to the question of the phylogenetic placement of HPyV12), statistical support
observed for the corresponding bipartitions in the VP2 and VP1 analyses is also shown (grey panels). Hyphen indicates that bipartition was not
observed in the ML or Bayesian tree. The scale axis is in amino acid substitution per site. This chronogram was rooted using a relaxed clock. A
maximum likelihood analysis of the same dataset concluded to a similar topology and is thus not shown here.

(residues 100–147). The NCCR contains 4 repeats of the putative
GAGGC LTAg binding site and AT-rich palindromic sequences.
The NCCR possesses potential binding sites for numerous cellular
transcription factors, but the functional importance of these sites
remains to be proven (Figure S4).
Phylogenetic analysis of HPyV12
Three alignments consisting of 98, 259, and 488 amino acids
were generated from HPyV12 VP2, VP1 and LTAg sequences,
respectively, and those of other polyomaviruses for which
complete genomes were available (Table S3). On this basis, ML
and Bayesian analyses of the individual coding sequences were
performed. Only the analyses of LTAg sequences did support a
clear placement of HPyV12, which was neither contradicted nor
supported by VP2 and VP1 analyses (Figure 2). In the LTAg
phylogeny, HPyV12 appeared as the earliest offshoot of a large
clade comprising (by decreasing order of frequency) ape, bat,
monkey, rodent and human PyVs (i.e., MCPyV and TSPyV). The
branching order of the main lineages comprised within this clade
could not be determined as most internal branches only received
moderate statistical support. On the other hand, the clade
comprising HPyV12 appeared quite clearly as the sister clade to
a group of primate polyomaviruses including HPyV9.
Prevalence of HPyV12 in clinical samples
The 242 samples from gastrointestinal organs, spleens and
lymph nodes were re-evaluated with diagnostic nested PCR and
qPCR. The presence of HPyV12 sequences was confirmed in the
samples that were originally HPyV12-positive in the initial generic
PCR. In addition, 10 liver samples tested positive that had been

negative in the generic PCR. In total, 14/124 liver samples (11%)
were HPyV12-positive (Table 3). One positive sample each was
also identified among rectum (n = 6) and colon (n = 4) samples.
Analysis of gall bladder (n = 21), esophagus and stomach (cardia)
(each n = 2) yielded negative results (Table 3). Spleens (n = 61) and
lymph nodes (n = 22) were also HPyV12-negative (Table 3). To
further elucidate the prevalence of HPyV12, body fluids and
excretions were analyzed. Testing of feces (n = 56) revealed one
HPyV12-positive sample. Plasma (n = 54), serum (n = 45), urine
(n = 152), oral fluids (n = 30), bronchoalveolar lavage fluids (n = 22)
and cerebrospinal fluids (n = 35) were negative (Table 3). In
qPCR, the HPyV12-positive DNA samples revealed genome copy
numbers of up to 133/PCR reaction (equivalent to 27 copies/ml
DNA from fluid samples; 532 copies/ mg DNA from tissue
samples). In summary, analysis of 636 clinical samples revealed
the presence of HPyV12 only in organs of the gastrointestinal tract
and in feces.
Seroprevalence of HPyV12
To detect antibodies against HPyV12 VP1, a capsomer-based
ELISA was performed. A pediatric population of 74 subjects and
299 healthy adults and adolescents were tested, and the data were
stratified by age. The seroprevalence of HPyV12 was 12% in
children of age 2–5 and rose to 26% in the group of age 6–11. In
young adults of age 21–30, a prevalence of 27% was determined.
In older adults the prevalence ranged between 15% and 33%
(Figure 3). A difference in HPyV12 seroprevalence between male
and female adults was not observed (data not shown).
Discussion
The present study reports on the discovery of a hitherto
unknown polyomavirus (HPyV12) in humans. The novel poly￾omavirus was detected by generic PCR, real-time PCR and
conventional nested PCR in liver specimens of 14 individuals as
well as in the colon, rectum and feces of single individuals (Tables 1
and 2). To study the seroprevalence of HPyV12, ELISA was
performed that was considered to specifically detect VP1
antibodies against HPyV12. The assay revealed that healthy
individuals are frequently infected with HPyV12 before the age of
twenty (Figure 3). We believe that cross-reaction with antibodies
raised against other known human polyomaviruses is unlikely to
explain these results as none of their VP1 proteins displays more
than 60% identity to HPyV12 VP1. Cross-reactions of VP1
proteins in serological assays have only been observed when the
proteins revealed more than 75% identity [2,4,5,11,41], and no
cross-reactivity between VP1 antibodies from the known human
polyomaviruses has been detected [2,4,5,11,41–44]. We cannot,
however, exclude cross-reactivity between HPyV12 VP1 and
antibodies directed against not yet identified human polyoma￾viruses. The seroprevalence reported here should therefore be
regarded as a first estimate. Taken together, HPyV12 can be
regarded as a virus that naturally infects humans at young age and
resides in the gastrointestinal tract.
It is remarkable that - besides the novel HPyV12 - only MCPyV
was detected in liver and other organs of the gastrointestinal tract.
It is unlikely that this would be the result of a failure of the applied
PCR system to detect other polyomaviruses since this system
allowed for the recovery of a number of polyomaviruses across the
entire phylogeny [11,32]. Therefore, this may indicate that the
other human polyomaviruses were at least not present in high copy
numbers in the gastrointestinal tract. The multiple detection of
MCPyV in livers is in line with a previous study that reported
detection of MCPyV in livers and other sites of the gastrointestinal
tract [25]. Since liver specimens were highly overrepresented in
our panel of gastrointestinal tract specimens (124/159), it could be
concluded that polyomaviruses other than HPyV12 and MCPyV
do not reside regularly in the liver. A prediction on the other
organs of the gastrointestinal tract studied here (gall bladder,
stomach, colon, rectum) was not possible since sample numbers
were too small. A similarly low abundance of polyomaviruses was
observed in lymphoid organs (Table 1). This is in contrast to the
frequent presence of polyomaviruses in lymphoid organs of the
closest relative of humans, the chimpanzee [32], and indicates a
major difference in polyomavirus tropism between these closely
related hominine hosts.
Human polyomaviruses, such as BKPyV and JCPyV, induce
tumors in animal models. However, their role in human cancer
remains a matter of debate [45-47]. The recently identified
MCPyV is the first polyomavirus that is etiologically associated
with a human tumor [8,19,48]. It is noteworthy that HPyV12 is
the first human polyomavirus whose LTAg lacks any LxCxE
motif. As this motif is essential to the retinoblastoma protein￾dependent transforming activity of other polyomaviruses, HPyV12
may exhibit a reduced transforming potential. It is clear that, in
addition to continued efforts aimed at completing our view of the
diversity of the human polyomavirome, efforts should also be
made to characterize the biology and the possible impact on
human health of novel human polyomaviruses.
