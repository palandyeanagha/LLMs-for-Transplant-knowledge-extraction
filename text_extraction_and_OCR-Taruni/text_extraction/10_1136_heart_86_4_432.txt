Abstract
OBJECTIVE To test the hypothesis that diastolic mitral annular
motion velocity, as determined by Doppler tissue imaging and left
ventricular diastolic flow propagation velocity, is related to the
histological degree of heart transplant rejection according to the
International Society of Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT).
METHODS In 41 heart transplant recipients undergoing 151
myocardial biopsies, the following Doppler echocardiographic
measurements were performed within one hour of biopsy:
transmitral and pulmonary vein flow indices; mitral annular motion
velocity indices; left ventricular diastolic flow propagation velocity.
RESULTS Late diastolic mitral annular motion velocity (ADTI) and
mitral annular systolic contraction velocity (SCDTI) were higher in
patients with ISHLT < IIIA than in those with ISHLT ⩾ IIIA (ADTI,
8.8 cm/s v 7.7 cm/s (p = 0.03); SCDTI, 19.3 cm/s v 9.3 cm/s (p < 
0.05)). Sensitivity and specificity of ADTI< 8.7 cm/s (the best cut off
value) in predicting significant heart transplant rejection were 82%
and 53%, respectively. Early diastolic mitral annular motion
velocity (EDTI) and flow propagation velocity were not related to
the histological degree of heart transplant rejection.
CONCLUSIONS Doppler tissue imaging of the mitral annulus is
useful in diagnosing heart transplant rejection because a high late
diastolic mitral annular motion velocity can reliably exclude severe
rejection. However, a reduced late diastolic mitral annular motion
velocity cannot predict severe rejection reliably because it is not
specific enough.
