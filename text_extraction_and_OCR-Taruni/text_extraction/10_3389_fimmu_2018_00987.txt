Emerging evidence indicates that gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) has many beneficial 
effects such as ameliorating immune and inflammatory response. But, here we reported 
that activation of GABAA receptors (GABAA Rs) aggravated dextran sulfate sodium 
(DSS)-induced colitis, although the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines was 
inhibited. By contrast, blocking of GABAA Rs markedly alleviated DSS-induced colitis. 
Notably, GABAA Rs and glutamic acid decarboxylase 65/67 were significantly increased 
in colon mucosa of ulcerative colitis patients and the mouse model of colitis. Further 
studies showed that GABA treatment resulted in an increment of serum FITC-dextran 
following its oral administration, a decrement of transepithelial electrical resistance, and 
an increment of bacterial invasion, effects which were blocked by bicuculline. In addition, 
GABA inhibited the expression of tight junction proteins and mucin secretion in colitis 
colon. GABA also decreased the expression of ki-67 and increased cleaved-caspase 3 
expression in intestinal epithelia. Our data indicate that the GABAA Rs activation within 
colon mucosa disrupts the intestinal barrier and increases the intestinal permeability 
which facilitates inflammatory reaction in colon. Meanwhile, the suppression effect of 
GABA on pro-inflammatory cytokines leads to insufficient bacteria elimination and further 
aggravated the bacteria invasion and inflammatory damage.

INTRODUCTION
Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the mature central 
nervous system (CNS) (1, 2). It is synthesized through the decarboxylation of glutamate by the 
enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), which includes GAD 65 and GAD 67 (3) and can 
bind with two major types of GABA receptors, such as GABAA receptor (GABAA R) and GABAB
receptor (GABAB R). GABAA Rs are hetero-pentameric chloride ion channels assembled from a 
repertoire of 19 subunits (α1–6, β1–3, γ1–3, δ, ɛ, θ, π, ρ1–3) (2). The most common subtypes in the CNS 
consist of two α subunits, two β subunits, and one copy of an additional subunit (4). The GABAB R is 
a G protein-coupled receptor (5). In addition to its well-known effects within the CNS, GABA and 
its receptors are present in various peripheral tissues, such as the pancreas, gastrointestinal tract, 
and immune cells (6, 7). Moreover, it has been reported that the immune system harbors all of the

necessary constituents for GABA signaling, and GABA itself may 
function as a paracrine or autocrine factor (8). Recent studies have 
revealed that GABA and GABAA R agonists protect against many 
autoimmune diseases such as type 1 diabetes (9), experimental 
autoimmune encephalomyelitis (8), collagen-induced arthritis 
(10, 11), and contact dermatitis (12). The mechanisms are not 
fully understood. Prud’homme et al. found that GABA inhibits 
T-cell activation via GABAA Rs (13). Recently, the same group 
demonstrated that GABA also showed anti-inflammatory effects 
(14). GABA therapy in the streptozotocin-induced diabetes 
model prevented insulitis by reducing serum levels of inflamma￾tory cytokines (15). GABA treatment also has been demonstrated 
to downregulate inflammatory responses in mouse models of 
rheumatoid arthritis and obesity (11, 16). Collating these find￾ings reveals that GABAergic system is potentially a new target for 
modulating immune and inflammatory conditions.
Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder 
and characterized by a relapsing and remitting mucosal inflam￾mation. The symptoms include rectal bleeding, diarrhea, and 
abdominal pain. While the etiology of UC is not known, a 
dysregulation in intestinal mucosal barrier function and mucosal 
immune and inflammatory responses are critical factors associ￾ated with the pathogenesis of UC. The intestinal mucosal barrier 
forms a physical barrier to confine luminal bacteria by separating 
luminal bacteria from underlying immune cells (17). Once it is 
breached, luminal bacteria can invade the lamina propria (LP) 
and initiate an inflammatory response. In turn, immune cells 
are recruited and produce pro-inflammatory cytokines which 
further impair epithelial integrity, thereby creating a vicious 
cycle, eventually leading to unrestrained inflammatory responses 
(18). Therefore, blocking this inflammatory cascade is essential 
for the treatment of UC. Anti-TNF-α monoclonal antibody, such 
as infliximab, adalimumab, and golimumab, have long been used 
to treat moderate-to-severe UC and are effective in inducing and 
maintaining remission in UC (19–21). In light of the ability for 
the GABAergic system to directly suppress immune and inflam￾matory responses, we considered it important to investigate the 
potential role and mechanism of GABA in UC. To accomplish 
this goal, we examined the effects of GABA in dextran sulfate 
sodium (DSS)-induced mouse model of colitis and colonic tissue 
samples from UC patients as well as in colonic cell lines.
In contrast to that of results from previous reports on autoim￾mune diseases, here we found an unexpected pro-inflammatory 
role for the GABAergic system in UC. Specifically, our results 
showed an upregulation in GABAergic signaling within colonic 
biopsy specimens from UC patients and in the DSS-induced 
colitis model. The activation of GABAA Rs exacerbated intes￾tinal mucosal damage in the DSS-induced colitis model while 
positively promoting immunoprotective cytokines and reducing 
pro-inflammatory factors, as reported previously in autoim￾mune diseases (8, 14, 15). In parallel with these findings, was the 
observation that blocking of GABAA Rs significantly ameliorated 
DSS-induced colitis, although it boosted the production of pro￾inflammatory cytokines. Further studies showed that GABA 
treatment inhibited tight junction (TJ) proteins expression and 
mucin secretion in colitis colon. GABA also inhibited colonic epi￾thelial cell proliferation and promoted its apoptosis. The results of 
our current investigation indicate that GABA, when binding with 
GABAA Rs disrupts the intestinal barrier and consequently bowel 
bacteria invasion to then activate severe inflammatory damage in 
this UC model. Moreover, the suppression effect of GABA on pro￾inflammatory cytokines further aggravated the bacteria invasion 
and inflammatory damage.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animals and Treatment
Male C57BL/6 mice, 8–10  weeks old, were housed under SPF 
conditions. In the first series of experiments, mice were divided 
randomly into six groups with eight mice per group. Acute colitis 
was induced by administering 3% (wt/vol) DSS at a molecular 
weight of 36,000–50,000 Da (MP Biomedicals, Santa Ana, CA, 
USA) in their drinking water for 7 days ad libitum and euthanized 
on day 7. The six groups consisted of (1) vehicle-treated controls 
(Control), (2) DSS in drinking water (DSS), (3) DSS mice receiv￾ing a daily i.p. injection of GABA (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, 
USA) at 5 mg/kg (DSS + GABA), (4) DSS mice receiving a daily 
i.p. injection of muscimol (Tocris Bioscience, Ellisville, MO, USA) 
at 2  mg/kg (DSS +  muscimol), (5) DSS +  GABA mice receiv￾ing a daily i.p. injection of (+)-bicuculine (Tocris Bioscience, 
Ellisville, MO, USA) at 5 mg/kg (DSS + GABA + bicuculline), 
and (6) DSS mice receiving a daily i.p. injection of (+)-bicuculine 
(DSS + bicuculline). Mice were monitored daily for weight loss, 
stool consistency, and fecal bleeding.
A second series of experiments was conducted using the same 
six treatment groups as described above, but with animals being 
treated for only 3 days and euthanized on day 3.
Chronic colitis was induced by three cycles of a 5-day (days 
1–5, 11–15, and 21–25) treatment with 1.5% DSS in drinking 
water followed by 5 days (days 6–10, 16–20, and 26–30) recovery 
on normal water. Mice were divided randomly into six groups: (1) 
vehicle-treated controls (Control), (2) 1.5% DSS in drinking water 
(DSS), (3) DSS mice receiving a daily i.p. injection of GABA at 
2.5 mg/kg during each period of recovery (DSS + GABA), (4) DSS 
mice receiving a daily i.p. injection of muscimol at 1 mg/kg dur￾ing each period of recovery (DSS + muscimol), (5) DSS + GABA 
mice receiving a daily i.p. injection of (+)-bicuculine at 2.5 mg/kg 
during each period of recovery (DSS + GABA + bicuculline), and 
(6) DSS mice receiving a daily i.p. injection of (+)-bicuculine at 
2.5  mg/kg during each period of recovery (DSS +  bicuculline). 
Mice were monitored daily for weight loss, stool consistency, and 
fecal bleeding as described in acute colitis model. On day 30, the 
animals were sacrificed. Blood were collected from the retrobulbar 
venous plexus. The entire colon was dissected, after measuring the 
colon length, the distal colon was fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde 
for the histopathological examination.

in DMEM supplemented medium with 10% FBS, 100 IU/ml of 
penicillin, and 100 mg/ml of streptomycin (Gibco, Grand Island, 
NY, USA) in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. To test the effect 
of GABA on DSS-treated cells, cells were grown in 12-well plates. 
Fully differentiated cell monolayers were then incubated with or 
without 2% DSS in the absence or presence of GABA (100 µM), 
muscimol (10 µM), or bicuculline (10 µM) for 48 h.
Histology
Mice were euthanized at the indicated time points. Following 
measurement of the colon length, distal colon tissue samples were 
embedded in paraffin following standard histological procedures. 
Four-micrometer sections were stained with hematoxylin and 
eosin. Histological damage was assessed based on the severity of 
inflammation (score 0–3), depth of injury (score 0–3), damage 
of the crypt (score 0–4), and percent of area involved (score 0–4) 
according to methods previously described (22). For the sever￾ity of inflammation scores in the colon mucosa: 0 = no or rare 
inflammatory cells in the LP, 1 = increased numbers of inflam￾matory cells in the LP, 2 =  inflammatory cells extending into 
the submucosa, and 3 = transmural extension of inflammatory 
cell infiltration (23). For depth of injury scores: 0 = absence of 
mucosal damage, 1 = discrete epithelial lesions, 2 = mucosal ero￾sion or ulceration, and 3 = transmural damage. For crypt damage 
scores: 0=none, 1=less than 5% involvement, 2 = 33% damage, 
3 = 66% damaged, and 4 = complete loss of entire crypt and epi￾thelium. For the percent area involved: 1 = 1–25%, 2 = 26–50%, 
3 = 51–75%, and 4 = 76–100%. Total scores represented that of 
the sum of individual scores. Colonic damage score was the sum 
of individual scores (24).
Cytokine Levels
Colon samples were homogenized in ice-cold PBS. The super￾natants were collected and stored at −80°C for enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Total amount of proteins from 
the different samples was determined using the Bradford assay 
(Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). Cytokines (IL-10, IL-12, 
IFN-γ, and TNF-α) in the homogenates were directly measured 
using a commercial ELISA kit (all from Shanghai Enzyme-linked 
Biotechnology, Shanghai, China) according to the manufacturer’s 
instructions. The optical density of the colorimetric reaction was 
measured at 450 nm with a plate reader.
Intestinal Permeability
Mice were euthanized at the indicated time points. Intestinal perme￾ability was assessed using a FITC-dextran tracer (4 kDa, 0.4 mg/g 
body weight, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) as described 
previously (25). Mice were gavaged with 0.5 ml of FITC-dextran 
at 4 h before being euthanized. Blood samples were collected at the 
time of sacrifice and allowed to clot for 30 min. Then samples were 
centrifuged for 90 s at 6,000 g. FITC-dextran concentration was 
determined using fluorospectrometry at an excitation wavelength 
of 488 nm and emission wavelength of 520 nm.
Bacterial Culture
To evaluate bacterial penetration within the colon as determined 
on day 7 after DSS treatment, a 1-cm segment of distal colon was 
sectioned longitudinally and the luminal contents were rinsed 
off with sterile PBS. The tissue was weighed, homogenized, and 
serially diluted with sterile PBS. The diluted homogenates were 
plated in triplicate on Brain Heart Infusion (BHI) agar and Blood 
agar (Hopebio-Technology, Qingdao, Shandong, China) and 
incubated for 24 h at 37°C. Colony-forming units (CFUs) were 
normalized to grams of intestinal tissue (CFU/g) to represent 
gut-associated bacterial counts (26).
Ussing Chamber Studies
Mice were euthanized on day 3 after the DSS treatment. Colon 
mucosal membranes were harvested and mounted in Ussing 
chambers as previously described (27). Two-centimeter segments 
of the proximal colon were harvested and sectioned longitudi￾nally along the mesenteric border. The seromusculature layers 
were removed by blunt dissection under a stereomicroscope. The 
mucosal membranes were then mounted between the two halves 
of the Ussing chamber with 0.28 cm2
 of exposed area and each 
side of the tissue was bathed with 1 ml of Krebs solution at 37°C 
and saturated with CO2/O2 (5/95%). Tissues were voltage clamped 
to zero using an automatic voltage clamp and the transepithelial 
electrical resistance (TEER) was recorded.
Alcian Blue-Periodic Acid Sthiff’s 
(AB-PAS) Staining
Mice treated with or without DSS were euthanized on day 3 after 
the GABA treatment. For the detection of acidic mucin, AB-PAS 
staining of sections from paraffin-embedded tissue were evaluated 
using a commercial AB-PAS kit (Solarbio Life Sciences, Beijing, 
China) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Sections 
were stained by alcian blue solution (pH 2.5) for 15 min, washed 
in water for 5 min, then oxidized in 1% periodic acid at room 
temperature for 10 min, washed in water for 5 min, and stained 
by Schiff ’s solution for 10 min.
Immunohistochemistry 
and Immunofluorescence
Sections (4-µm thick) from paraffin-embedded colon tissue were 
prepared for immunohistochemistry or immunofluorescent 
staining. Briefly, staining was achieved with use of primary anti￾bodies against GABAA R β2/3 (1:200, mouse monoclonal, 05-474; 
Millipore), GAD 65/67 (1:100, mouse monoclonal, sc-365180; 
Santa Cruz), CD-45 (1:300, mouse monoclonal, 610265; BD 
Biosciences), mucin-2 (1:300; rabbit polyclonal, sc-15334; Santa 
Cruz), ki-67 (1:300; rabbit monoclonal, 12202S; CST), cleaved 
caspase-3 (1:300; rabbit polyclonal, 9661S; CST), junctional 
adhesion molecule 1 (JAM-1) (1:200; rabbit polyclonal, ab180821; 
Abcam), and occludin (1:200; rabbit polyclonal, ab168986; 
Abcam). As secondary antibodies, Alexa 488 conjugated-goat 
anti-rabbit antibody (1:1,000; A11008; ThermoFisher) or Alexa 
568 conjugated-goat anti-mouse antibody (1:1,000; A-21043; 
Invitrogen) was used for immunofluorescent staining, while Broad 
Spectrum Zymed Poly HRP conjugated secondary antibodies 
(1:50; GK600505; Gene Tech) were used for immunohistochem￾istry. Human Caco-2 cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde 
in 0.1 M phosphate buffer for 15 min. JAM-1 antibodies (1:200;

rabbit polyclonal, ab180821; Abcam) were incubated overnight 
at 4°C. After three washes with PBS, slides were incubated with 
Alexa 568 conjugated donkey anti-rabbit antibody (1:1,000; 
A10042, Invitrogen) for 30 min and DAPI-containing PBST for 
5 min.
Protein Extraction and Western Blotting
Cells or colon tissues from each group were thawed and homoge￾nized. The supernatants were collected for a protein assay. Protein 
extracts were isolated, separated by SDS PAGE, and transferred to 
a PVDF membrane (Millipore, Burlington, MA, USA). The mem￾brane was incubated overnight with specific primary antibodies 
at 4°C. The membranes were incubated with chemiluminescent 
solution (Millipore, Burlington, MA, USA). Band density was 
determined using the Image J analyzer software (version 1.48).
Electron Microscopy and Morphometry
At times indicated after DSS treatment, mice were euthanized, 
and 1-mm segments of distal colon were carefully dissected and 
fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, 
USA) at 4°C. Samples were post-fixed with 1% OsO4 (Sigma￾Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) for 1 h, dehydrated, and embedded 
in resin. Ultra-thin sections (70-nm thick) were cut using an 
ultramicrotome (ultracut N; Leica, Germany) and collected on 
300 mesh thin-bar copper grids. The sections were stained with 
uranyl acetate and lead citrate and were then observed using 
transmission electron microscopy (Philips Tecnai 20 U-Twin, 
Holland) and photographed.
Statistics
All data represent the mean ± SEM unless otherwise indicated. 
To compare two groups, an unpaired t-test was used. To compare 
three or more groups, an ANOVA was performed followed by 
Student–Newman–Keuls’s post hoc test for pairwise comparisons. 
For data that failed to be normally distributed, the nonparametric 
Kruskal–Wallis test was used followed by the Mann–Whitney 
U-test for pairwise post hoc comparisons. A P value less than 0.05 
was required for results to be considered statistically significant.
RESULTS
GABAergic Signals Are Upregulated in 
Colon Mucosa of Colitis
The expression of GABAergic signals within colon mucosa of 
mice was first examined by assessing GABAA Rs and GAD 65/67 
expression using immunofluorescence. We found that GABAA
R β2/3 was present in both colonic epithelial cells and some 
LP cells, which probably represented infiltrating immune cells. 
GAD 65/67 was mainly expressed in intestinal epithelium and 
crypt cells, especially in the base of the crypt. Colonic GABAA R 
and GAD 65/67 expressions were increased after DSS treatment 
(Figure  1A). Western blot results corroborated these findings 
(Figure  1B). In addition, we also found that expressions of 
GAD 65/67, GABAA R α6, and β2/3 subunits were present in the 
human intestinal epithelial cell lines, such as Caco-2 and HT29 
(Figure 1C). To investigate their expression in human colonic 
mucosa, we further analyzed GABAergic signals expression in 
the public gene dataset (dataset GSE9452) of UC samples. The 
results revealed that GAD 65, GAD 67, and the π subunit of 
GABAA Rs were all upregulated in these samples when com￾pared with those of samples from healthy controls (Figure 1D). 
Immunostaining also revealed high levels of GAD 65/67 and 
GABAA Rs β2/3 subunits expressions were found in UC tissues 
when compared with UC-adjacent tissues (Figure  1E). Taken 
together, these results suggest that the upregulation of GABAergic 
signals in colorectal mucosa epithelium may be associated with 
the pathogenesis of UC.
GABA Promotes DSS-Induced Colitis 
in Mice
To determine the potential role of GABA in colonic inflammation, 
the induction of acute colitis was assessed in DSS mice treated 
(DSS + GABA) or not (DSS) with GABA. Our results showed 
that the DSS + GABA group had more severe colitis symptoms 
as indicated by significant reductions in colon length on day 7, 
greater losses of body weight and increases in the disease activity 
index (DAI) from day 5 after DSS treatment when compared with 
the DSS group (Figures 2A–E). Although no statistically signifi￾cant differences were present for the DAI as determined on day 7, 
GABA reduced the survival rate to 33% in the DSS + GABA vs. 
100% in the DSS group (Figure 2F). Histopathological analysis 
confirmed that DSS-induced colitis in mice treated with GABA 
showed more damage to their epithelium (Figures  2G,H) and 
substantially higher levels of leukocyte infiltration into their dis￾tal colon mucosa when compared with the DSS group (Figure 3). 
Further result showed that GABAA Rs agonist, muscimol, also 
resulted in much more severe symptoms of colitis as GABA when 
compared with the DSS alone group. These changes were reduced 
by treatment with the GABAA R competitive antagonist, bicucul￾line. To further evaluate the effect of endogenous GABA in this 
mouse colitis model, co-administration of bicuculline to DSS 
group significantly reduced colitis symptoms and epithelial dam￾age. These results suggest that both endogenous and exogenous 
GABA exacerbate DSS-induced acute colitis through activation 
of GABAA Rs.
To further determine the potential role of GABA in chronic 
colitis, we assessed the body weight loss, DAI, colon length, and 
histological damage in different groups as indicated. Our results 
showed although there was no significant difference in colon 
length in different groups (Figure 4B), chronic DSS group showed 
increased weight loss and DAI score when compared with the 
control group at each time point. GABA increased weight loss 
on days 12 and 14 and muscimol increased weight loss on days 
14, 28, and 30 when compared with the DSS alone group. GABA 
increased the DAI on days 26, 28, and 30 and muscimol increased 
the DAI on days 8, 14, and 16 when compared with the DSS alone 
group. Bicuculline partly blocks these changes (Figures 4C,D). 
Consistent with the results in the acute colitis model, histopatho￾logical analysis found that DSS-induced chronic colitis in mice 
treated with GABA or muscimol showed more histological dam￾age to their epithelium. These histological damages were reduced 
by co-treatment with bicuculline (Figure 4E).

increased colon IL-10 production in the DSS +  GABA group 
vs. that observed in the DSS alone group, again, an effect which 
was reversed with a co-administration of bicuculline (Figure 5). 
These data suggest that both endogenous and exogenous GABA 
significantly decreased pro-inflammatory cytokine production, 
but increased production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine, 
IL-10, through activation of GABAA Rs. These results are consist￾ent with previous studies (8, 14, 15). Blocking of GABAA Rs was 
also shown to significantly increase the production of IL-12 and 
IFN-γ when compared with levels observed in the DSS group.

An in vivo intestinal permeability assay was performed to assess 
barrier function using FITC-dextran on day 7 of DSS treatment.

observed in control mice and treatment with muscimol further 
increased levels of serum FITC-dextran, indicating more severe 
damage of intestinal barrier function. Bicuculline alleviated 
this increment in serum FITC-dextran in DSS-treated mice 
(Figure 6A). Consistently, the number of bacteria in colonic tis￾sues was found to be increased in the DSS group as indicated in

both BHI agar and blood agar. Treatment with muscimol further 
promoted these increments in penetrating bacterial numbers 
while bicuculline co-administration decreased bacterial numbers 
in the colon tissue in DSS-induced colitis (Figures 6B,C). These 
data indicate that GABA increased intestinal permeability and 
bacterial penetration through activation of GABAA Rs.
Tissue TEER measurements serve as an indicator for epithe￾lial barrier integrity. We found that DSS significantly reduced 
mucosal TEER compared with that observed within the control 
group as determined on day 3. Day 3 was selected for this analysis 
as mucosal damage was too severe to be harvested on day 7. Either 
GABA or muscimol produced additional decreases of TEER in 
this DSS-induced colitis model while bicuculline reversed these 
changes (Figure 6D). These data indicate that GABA aggravated 
intestinal barrier damage by affecting the integrity of the epithe￾lial barrier.
To investigate the effect of GABA on intestinal permeability 
in chronic colitis, mice were also gavaged with FITC-dextran at 
4 h before being euthanized. Consistent with the results in the 
acute colitis model, chronic DSS treatment significantly increased 
serum FITC-dextran concentration when compared with the 
control group. Treatment with GABA or muscimol further 
increased levels of serum FITC-dextran when compared with 
the DSS-induced chronic colitis group. These increments were 
reduced by treatment with bicuculline (Figure 6E).
Detection and Observation of Intestinal 
Mucosal Ultrastructure
Destruction of TJs is a major factor contributing to epithelial 
dysfunction. In our experiments, an enlarged TJ and expan￾sion of the endoplasmic reticulum were observed in both the 
DSS and DSS + GABA groups when compared with that of the 
control group on day 7. Adheren junctions were expanded and 
more phagocytotic vesicles were found in the DSS + GABA vs. 
DSS group, indicating that more severe injuries were induced 
by the presence of GABA. The damage resulting from GABA 
was significantly ameliorated following bicuculline treatment 
(Figure 7).
GABA Decreased the Expression of 
Junctional Adhesion Molecule (JAM) and 
Occludin Between Colonic Epithelial Cells
Tight junction protein complexes include JAMs, occludin (28), 
and claudins (29). JAMs and occludin play central roles in the 
physical regulation of paracellular permeability (30). Our results 
showed that GABA and muscimol decreased JAM-1 and occludin 
expression on day 3 in the DSS-induced colitis mouse model, 
an effect which was blocked by bicuculline (Figures  8A,B). 
Similar results were obtained in our in vitro study using Caco-2 
cells (Figure 8C). These data indicate that decrements in JAM-1

and occludin expression may be responsible for the decrease in 
mucosal TEER.
GABA Disrupted the Mucus Barrier
We next assessed mucous layers in all groups on day 3 following 
DSS treatment. A significant reduction in the mucous layer was 
observed in DSS-induced colitis mice treated with either GABA or 
muscimol, an effect which was blocked by bicuculline (Figure 9A). 
Since mucus within the colon is mainly secreted by goblet cells, we 
next examined whether GABA affected the goblet cells as deter￾mined by evaluating muc-2 expression. Our results showed that 
goblet cell numbers per crypt decreased in GABA treated DSS￾induced colitis colon. Bicuculline blocked the reduction induced 
by exogenous and endogenous GABA (Figures 9B,C). These data 
indicate that activation of GABAA Rs decreased mucous layer 
thickness via reductions in goblet cell numbers.

GABA Inhibits Colonic Epithelial Cell 
Proliferation and Increases Its Apoptosis
Immunohistochemistry results showed that the number of ki￾67-positive cells decreased significantly after 3 days following DSS 
treatment when compared with that of the control group. GABA 
or muscimol administration to DSS mice further reduced the 
number of ki-67-positive cells in comparison with that of the DSS 
alone group (Figures 10A,C). Taken together, these data provide 
strong evidence indicating that reductions in ki-67-positive cells 
were a major factor contributing to crypt destruction. We next 
examined whether GABA affected colonic epithelial cell apop￾tosis in colitis mice. Results showed either GABA or muscimol 
further increased the number of cleaved caspase-3-positive cells 
in DSS-induced colitis, while bicuculline blocked these changes 
(Figures 10B,D). These data indicate that activation of GABAA Rs 
induces apoptosis of epithelial cells in colitis colon.
DISCUSSION
Gamma-aminobutyric acid, through its major inhibitory role 
within the CNS, regulates neuronal excitability. However, recent 
data demonstrate that GABA is also critical in ameliorating 
immune and inflammatory responses as demonstrated in several 
autoimmune diseases. Our present results reveal that GABAergic 
signals are upregulated and associated with the pathogenesis of 
UC in colon tissue as demonstrated in both UC patients and in 
the DSS-induced mouse colitis model. Although GABA signifi￾cantly decreased pro-inflammatory cytokine levels and increased 
anti-inflammatory cytokine production in DSS-induced acute 
colitis, surprising, unlike that in autoimmune diseases, GABA 
accelerated the onset and progression of DSS-induced acute 
colitis, an effect which was blocked by bicuculline. Further results 
showed that GABA inhibited mucosal epithelia reproduction and 
promoted its apoptosis in colitis colon. Such an effect produces a 
disruption in intestinal barrier integrity and a reduction in goblet 
cells, eventually leading to a reduction of the mucous layer. These 
findings suggest that GABA disrupted intestinal barrier, increased 
bacterial penetration which enhances immune and inflammatory 
damage to the colon mucosa.
Our current findings show that β2/3 subunits of GABAA R and 
GAD 65/67 were present in epithelial cells and some LP cells in 
both mouse and human colon. And, results from Western blots 
revealed that the subunits α5 and β2/3 of GABAA R and GAD 
65/67 were also expressed in human colorectal epithelial cells. 
Although we did not detect other subunits of GABAA Rs, these 
data indicate that GABAergic signaling exists in the colon mucosa 
and that GABA can be synthesized locally and may function as a 
paracrine or autocrine factor. Moreover, our results from analysis 
of the public gene datasets of UC samples showed an upregulation 
of GABAA Rs π subunit and GAD 65/67 in colorectal mucosa 
epithelium of UC patients. The immunohistochemistry and 
immunofluorescence results obtained from our colonic biopsy 
specimens of UC patients as well as the DSS-induced mouse 
colitis model further corroborated these results. Therefore, these 
results suggest that there is more GABA production and GABAA
R expression within the colon mucosa of UC patients, and the 
upregulation of GABAergic signals might be associated with the 
pathogenesis of UC. To determine the potential role of GABA in 
colonic inflammation, colon lengths, body weights, survival rate, 
DAI, and a histological analysis were performed and compared 
between DSS +  GABA and DSS groups. We found that DSS￾induced colitis in mice treated with GABA or muscimol showed 
more severe damage to colon epithelium and substantially higher 
levels of leukocyte infiltration into their distal colon mucosa when 
compared with the DSS group. These changes were reduced by 
treatment with the GABAA R competitive antagonist, bicuculline, 
indicating that GABA promoting DSS-induced colitis through 
activation of GABAA Rs. However, these findings would seem to 
be contrary to that of the well-characterized function of GABA, 
which has been reported to inhibit inflammation and ameliorate 
autoimmune diseases (31). Therefore, we next investigated 
whether GABA exerts the same suppressive effects upon cytokine 
secretion in colitis as that observed in autoimmune diseases. Our 
results showed that GABA administration reduced colon levels 
of inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IFNγ, and IL-12 in

DSS-induced colitis mice, while significantly increasing tissue 
levels of IL-10. These data are consistent with those changes 
observed in autoimmune diseases. Thus, GABA yields totally 
opposite effects on immune and inflammatory damage in colitis 
vs. autoimmune diseases, although it induced the same suppres￾sion effect on pro-inflammatory cytokines. The possible reasons

will be discussed later. Based on these results, we speculated that 
the accelerating inflammatory damage induced by GABA in our 
model was not mediated by inflammatory cytokine expression.
Intestinal barrier dysfunction plays a key role in the initiation 
and propagation of UC. Therefore, we examined whether GABA 
exacerbated colitis through contributing to intestinal barrier 
defects. Our results showed treatment with muscimol resulted in 
an increment of serum FITC-dextran and bacterial invasion in 
colonic tissues when compared with that of the DSS alone group, 
indicating that it increased the permeability of the intestinal bar￾rier. Bicuculline prevented this increase in permeability and the 
resultant increase in bacterial numbers within the colon tissue of 
colitis. Therefore, our data suggest that GABA increased intestinal 
permeability and bacterial penetration within the colon through 
activation of GABAA Rs.
The intestinal barrier includes both an epithelial and mucosal 
barrier. In our study, GABA reduced TEER, indicating that 
GABA aggravated the damaged intestinal barrier by affecting the 
epithelial integrity. Ultrastructure results also confirmed that 
tight junctional damage and more severe cellular injuries were 
induced by GABA. Bicuculline blocked these changes. Further 
study of this issue indicated that GABA and muscimol reduced 
JAM-1 and occludin expression in colitis mice. And, results from 
our in vitro study showed that GABA decreased JAM-1 staining 
in DSS-treated Caco-2 cells, which suggest one potential reason 
for the decrement of mucosa TEER. Treatment with bicuculline 
blocked these changes as determined. These data provide further 
evidence indicating that GABA also inhibits the expression of 
barrier-forming components of TJs through GABAA Rs. However, 
whether GABAA Rs activation has a direct or an indirect impact 
on TJs and the underlying mechanisms are still not known. This 
is clearly a case where further work is needed.
The intestinal mucosa is enclosed by a thick mucus layer, 
which serves as a major barrier between the epithelium and 
lumen of the host GI tract and plays an essential role in maintain 
homeostasis of the intestinal mucosa (32). Our present results 
reveal that GABA or muscimol significantly reduced this mucous 
layer in DSS-induced colitis mice, effects which were blocked by 
bicuculline. In addition, this reduction in the mucosal layer as 
induced by GABA was shown to be due to a reduction in goblet 
cells. Therefore, we conclude that GABA disrupted the mucous 
barrier through reducing goblet cell numbers via activation of 
its GABAA Rs.
To elucidate the possible mechanisms of goblet cells reduction 
induced by GABA, we further investigated the effects of GABA 
on epithelia proliferation and apoptosis in colitis. We found 
that GABA and muscimol significantly reduced the number of 
ki-67-positive cells and increased cleaved caspase-3-positive cells 
in the colon when compared with that of the DSS alone group, 
effects which were blocked by bicuculline. These results indicate 
that GABA and muscimol decrease the formation of goblet cells, 
most likely by inhibiting epithelia proliferation and/or induc￾ing apoptosis of colonic epithelial cells in colitis. In addition, 
the increased apoptosis of epithelial cells might also be partly 
responsible for the aforementioned destruction of TJ induced by 
GABAA Rs activation.
As discussed previously, GABA reduced the increments of 
pro-inflammatory cytokines and increased anti-inflammatory 
cytokines in the colitis colon. Based on these changes in cytokines 
within the colon, it was anticipated that mucosal inflammatory 
reactions should be inhibited by GABA treatment. On the con￾trary, GABA promoted histological damage in this DSS-induced 
mouse model of colitis. Traditionally, it is well known that 
inflammation underlies many chronic and degenerative diseases 
and chronic unresolved inflammation culminates in a host of 
pathologies such as cancer and fibrosis. However, inflammation 
also serves an important protective function that can eliminate its 
primary initiates such as foreign organisms, dead cells, or physi￾cal irritants. It has been reported that inflammatory cytokines, 
including TNF-α, IL-4, and IL-13, promote mucin gene expres￾sion in intestinal epithelial cells and prevent pathogen infection 
and colonization (33, 34). A recent paper also demonstrated 
that anti-TNF-α therapy in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) 
induced a twofold increase in the risk of opportunistic infections 
(35). Inflammation also plays a crucial role in the regeneration 
of injured tissues (34). In this way, insufficient inflammatory 
responses can result in tissue destruction by harmful initiates, 
especially bacteria (36). In the gastrointestinal tract, the large 
intestine harbors the highest numbers (1013–1014) of commensal 
bacteria (37, 38). Under normal conditions (non-colitic colon), 
infiltrated immune and inflammatory cells may have the capacity 
to produce sufficient amounts of cytokines to eliminate the bacte￾ria and inhibit the resultant severe tissue damage. However, in our 
model, GABA suppressed tissue pro-inflammatory cytokines and 
increased anti-inflammatory cytokine expression. Thus, colon 
bacteria invasion would not be effectively eliminated, thereby 
partly contributing to the histological damage observed. In this 
way, on the one hand, GABA induced destruction of the gut bar￾rier and increased bacterial penetration, and on the other hand, 
it reduced tissue pro-inflammatory cytokines in colon mucosa 
which led to the reduced elimination of invasive bacteria. Thus, 
although GABA application in UC results in a decrease of cytokine 
secretion, like that as seen in many autoimmune diseases without 
bacterial invasion, it can also contribute to the destruction, rather 
than the recovery of colon tissue under colitis conditions.
In summary, we found an upregulation of GABAergic signaling 
in UC which contributed to damage of intestinal barrier function 
and accelerated the histological damage. However, a previous study 
indicated that oral administration of topiramateis able to signifi￾cantly ameliorate an IBD phenotype in a trinitrobenzenesulfonic

acid (TNBS)-induced rodent model of colitis (39). Although 
topiramate is known to enhance GABAergic neurotransmission, 
it also has a broad spectrum of action such as blocking AMPA 
and kainate receptors, and sodium and calcium channels as well 
as inhibiting carbonic anhydrase (40, 41). Thus, it is hard to rule 
out the possibility that other factors contribute to the therapeutic 
effects of topiramate to TNBS-induced colitis. Additional studies 
are needed to determine the precise mechanism of topiramate 
in colitis. Work by Aggarwal et  al. (42) recently reported that 
GABA level decreased in serum and colon biopsy of UC patients, 
although GABAA R π subunit increased significantly. The authors 
speculated that reduced GABA level contributed to pathogenesis 
of UC. One explanation for the discrepancy may be due to differ￾ent models or different clinical course of the disease. In addition, 
as the authors had not studied the effect of blocking GABAergic 
signal in UC, extreme caution should be exercised when draw￾ing the conclusion of GABA reduction as a contributory factor 
for UC. Thus, further scientific efforts are needed to clarify the 
specific contribution of GABAergic system in UC.
Although acute DSS colitis is a good model to study the 
inflammatory onset caused by epithelial barrier destruction, it 
occurs in the absence of mature lymphocytes. Therefore, we per￾formed an initial pilot validation experiment using DSS-induced 
chronic colitis model to determine whether GABAA Rs activation 
plays the same role in chronic intestinal inflammation. Consistent 
with its role in acute colitis, GABA, or muscimol treatment also 
leads to more severe epithelial damage and an increment of serum 
FITC-dextran when compared with DSS alone group, suggesting 
that GABAA Rs activation increased the intestinal permeability 
in chronic colitis. Co-administration of bicuculline significantly 
reduced epithelial damage and the increment of intestinal perme￾ability. Therefore, these results suggest that GABAA Rs activation 
also facilitates the development of chronic colitis. However, fur￾ther studies are needed to investigate the roles and mechanisms 
using different colitis models.
Recently, GABA has attracted a considerable amount of 
attention for its potential use as a functional food. Accumulating 
evidence indicates that GABA supplemented foods have ben￾eficial effects, such as improvements in memory, reductions in 
blood pressure, and anti-anxiety effects (43–45). It has even been 
authenticated as a safe food supplement in a number of countries, 
such as US, China, and Japan. The dose limit for use of GABA 
in China is 500  mg/day. However, our current findings found 
that only 5 mg/kg of GABA as administration i.p. dramatically 
disrupted the mucosal barrier in DSS-induced colitis mouse 
model, and affected the vulnerability of colon to the induction 
of inflammatory processes. These findings suggest that GABA 
may have a potential role in inducing or exacerbating inflam￾matory damage within the colon. Clinically, GABAA R agonists 
are widely used such as benzodiazepines, barbiturates, propofol, 
and isoflurane (46). Accordingly, we suggest that caution should 
be exercised with regard to use of GABA supplements or drugs 
acting on GABAA Rs, especially in patients with gastrointestinal 
disease. Further clinical studies are needed to elucidate the role of 
GABA in mucosal barrier function, especially in patients treated 
with GABAergic drugs.
