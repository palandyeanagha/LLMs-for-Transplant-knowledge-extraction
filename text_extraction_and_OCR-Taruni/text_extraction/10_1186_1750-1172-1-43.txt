Abstract
Congenital pulmonary lymphangiectasia (PL) is a rare developmental disorder involving the lung,
and characterized by pulmonary subpleural, interlobar, perivascular and peribronchial lymphatic
dilatation. The prevalence is unknown. PL presents at birth with severe respiratory distress,
tachypnea and cyanosis, with a very high mortality rate at or within a few hours of birth. Most
reported cases are sporadic and the etiology is not completely understood. It has been suggested
that PL lymphatic channels of the fetal lung do not undergo the normal regression process at 20
weeks of gestation. Secondary PL may be caused by a cardiac lesion. The diagnostic approach
includes complete family and obstetric history, conventional radiologic studies, ultrasound and
magnetic resonance studies, lymphoscintigraphy, lung functionality tests, lung biopsy,
bronchoscopy, and pleural effusion examination. During the prenatal period, all causes leading to
hydrops fetalis should be considered in the diagnosis of PL. Fetal ultrasound evaluation plays a key
role in the antenatal diagnosis of PL. At birth, mechanical ventilation and pleural drainage are nearly
always necessary to obtain a favorable outcome of respiratory distress. Home supplemental oxygen
therapy and symptomatic treatment of recurrent cough and wheeze are often necessary during
childhood, sometimes associated with prolonged pleural drainage. Recent advances in intensive
neonatal care have changed the previously nearly fatal outcome of PL at birth. Patients affected by
PL who survive infancy, present medical problems which are characteristic of chronic lung disease.

Definition and diagnostic criteria
Congenital pulmonary lymphangiectasia (PL) is a rare
developmental disorder involving the lung and is charac￾terized by pulmonary subpleural, interlobar, perivascular,
and peribronchial lymphatic dilatation. On the basis of
improved characterization of the clinical presentation and
recent noteworthy advances in intensive neonatal care,
the original classification [1] has been modified and PL

has been sub-divided into two major categories, defined
as primary and secondary PL (Tables 1, 2) [2,3].
When presenting as a primary pulmonary developmental
defect, PL may be caused by a congenital defect in the pri￾mary development of the lung, or may represent the local￾ized expression of more generalized lymphatic
involvement. When it is part of generalized lymphatic
dysplasia, PL presents with dilated pulmonary lymphatics
as part of a generalized form of lymphangiectasia, i.e.,
truncal lymphangiectasia, which is usually associated
with lymphedema. Hemihypertrophy may also be
observed, although only rarely in infants and young chil￾dren.
Cardiovascular and lymphatic obstructive forms consti￾tute the secondary PL group. Hypoplastic left heart syn￾drome, pulmonary vein atresia, congenital mitral
stenosis, cor triatum, and thoracic duct agenesis are the
most likely causes of secondary PL.
Epidemiology
The incidence of PL is not clearly defined. Any attempt to
provide precise statistics regarding the incidence of PL
would be misleading considering that to date only a few
isolated cases or small series have been reported. Autopsy
studies suggest that approximately 0.5–1% of infants who
are stillborn or die in the neonatal period have PL, and in
two reported stillborn series, 5 out of 451 cases and 11 out
of 2,514 cases of PL, were identified [3]. Congenital PL
may be associated with non-immune hydrops fetalis and
with congenital chylothorax [4]. Although the incidence
of these conditions is not directly correlated to the possi￾ble incidence of PL, it may be useful to keep in mind that
the incidence of hydrops fetalis in obstetric-neonatal
referral centers may be as high as 1:800 [5]. Furthermore,
this condition carries a poor prognosis with a mortality
rate ranging from 50% to 98%, and the incidence of con￾genital chylothorax is about 1:10,000–15,000 pregnan￾cies, with a male-female ratio of 2:1 [5].
Clinical description
PL may present at birth as a stillbirth or with severe respi￾ratory distress, tachypnea, and cyanosis, with a very high
mortality rate at or within a few hours of birth [2]. Clinical
diagnosis of PL can be strongly suspected in full-term
neonates who present severe respiratory distress with
pleural effusion (especially if chylous) at birth, with or
without generalized or localized lymphedema.
As reported in the early studies on this topic, before effec￾tive mechanical ventilation became available most chil￾dren did not survive. Mechanical ventilation has almost
always been required in the most recently reported cases
[2,3].
In the post-neonatal period, children with PL present with
respiratory difficulties of varying degree, associated with a
relapsing course. During both the neonatal and post-neo￾natal period, PL may be associated with chylothorax, chy￾lopericardium, and chylous ascites. In older children it is
frequently associated with recurrent cough, wheeze,
increased respiratory effort with inspiratory crackle, and
even congestive heart failure. The disease is characterized
by frequent respiratory exacerbations [3,6].
Etiology
The etiology of PL is not known. It has been suggested that
PL lymphatic channels of the fetal lung do not undergo
the normal regression process at 20 weeks of gestation,
and thus there is a persistence of the large lymphatic ves￾sels that are normal form of the maturation developmen￾tal process at 9–16 weeks of gestation [7]. Obstruction of
pulmonary lymphatics or veins, or the action of infectious
agents have also been taken into consideration [2].
Secondary PL may be caused by a cardiac lesion. Pulmo￾nary lymphatics dilatation develops in utero as a result of
obstructed pulmonary venous flow, or cardiac lesions
which have been hypothesized to interfere with the nor￾mal regression of the lymphatic tissue elements after the
16th week of fetal life [3].

Lymphangiogenesis has been reviewed in several recent
papers [8-11]. Lymphatic vessels were first described in
the seventeenth century by the Italian scientist G. Aselli.
However, until a few years ago, the lymphatic system was
not considered an interesting topic. In 1902, Florence
Sabin proposed the most widely accepted model of lym￾phatic vasculature development. According to Sabin's pro￾posal, the peripheral lymphatic system originates from
the primary lymph sacs (jugular lymph sac, subclavian
lymph sac, retroperitoneal lymph sac, cysterne chyli, pos￾terior lymph sac), then spreads by endothelial sprunting
into the surrounding tissue and organs, where local capil￾laries are formed. A less popular model was proposed in
1910 by Huntington and McClure, who claimed that pri￾mary lymph sacs arise in the mesenchyme independently
of the veins and then establish venous connections. This
model has recently been supported by a study on chick￾ens. On the basis of recent studies, it has been proposed
that mammalian lymphatic vasculature develops in four
stages: lymphatic endothelial cell (LEC) competence, LEC
bias, LEC specification, and LEC differentiation. Knowl￾edge about the genes that are expressed and/or required
during lymphatic vasculature formation and about the
signal-transducing system for lymphatic endothelial cell
growth, migration, and maturation has improved signifi￾cantly.
Table 3 and Figure 1 summarize the most up-to-date
information regarding molecular pathways in lymphoan￾giogenesis and on lymphangiogenetic markers. Table 3
and Figure 1 have been obtained, with modifications,
from data published in previously cited papers [8-11].
Diagnostic methods
As previously reported, during the prenatal period all the
causes leading to hydrops fetalis have to be taken into
consideration in the diagnosis of PL [12-14]. The diagnos￾tic approach includes the following: complete family and
obstetric history; ultrasound examination and magnetic
resonance (MR) studies searching for twin gestation, ana￾tomic abnormalities, heart fetal echo and doppler blood
flow assessment; maternal evaluation including blood
type, Rhesus factor (Rh), antibody screening, Kleihauer￾Betke stain, TORCHES-CLAP titer (Toxoplasma gondii;
Rubella virus; Cytomegalovirus; Herpes simplex virus;
Enterovirus; Syphilis; Chickenpox [varicella-zoster] virus;
Lyme disease [borrelia burgdoferi]; Aids; Parvovirus B19),
metabolic studies, and hemoglobin (Hb) electrophoresis;
invasive fetal assessment involving amniocentesis (karyo￾type, cultures, TORCHES-CLAP, and restriction endonu￾clease and fetal blood sampling: blood type, Hb)
electrophoresis, blood gas, cultures, TORCHES-CLAP, and
DNA analysis, and fetal effusion sampling (TORCHES￾CLAP, protein content, and cell count) [14].
The postnatal diagnostic approach includes a laboratory
and instrumental evaluation that is needed to rule out var￾ious conditions possibly related to PL, and to establish
whether PL is primary or secondary.
Hematologic causes can be ruled out by blood cell count,
Kleihauer-Betke stain, Hb electrophoresis, cell blood
count (CBC) and smear; cardiovascular causes can be
excluded by echocardiogram and electrocardiogram
(ECG); congenital infections by TORCHES-CLAP titer
evaluation. Genitourinary causes can be excluded by kid￾ney sonography, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and plasma￾urine creatine analysis. Lastly, chromosomal, syndromic,
and metabolic diseases need to be ruled out by the usual
diagnostic protocols.
Diagnostic methods (Table 4) that may be useful in eval￾uating PL include conventional radiologic studies (Figure
2), high-resolution computed tomography (CT) (Figure
3) and MR imaging [2,4,6,15-26], lymphoscintigraphy
(figure 4) [2,4,26,27], lung functionality tests [6,12], lung

biopsy [6,19], bronchoscopy [6,19], and pleural effusion
examination [28-30]. Chest x-rays usually show hyperin￾flation with interstitial markings.
Longitudinal follow-up indicates the possible progression
of hazy infiltrates, which are usually seen during the neo￾natal period, to a more perihilar interstitial pattern with
varying degrees of lung inflation. Generally speaking, it
may be affirmed that, like the clinical features, the radio￾logical findings in PL improve over time.
CT demonstrates diffuse thickening of the interstitium,
both of the peribronchovascular interstitium and the
septa surrounding the lobules. Helical chest CT usually
highlights eventual diffuse interstitial change involving
thickening of the interlobular septa, which is very often
associated with the presence of pleural fluid effusion and
atelectasia.
Findings from CT scan studies have also shown improve￾ment over time, although the regional pattern of paren￾chymal inhomogeneity persisted in several studies.
Coronal MRI T1 may show thickening of the interstitium,
pleural fluid effusion, and atelectasia, if present. Axial
MRI T2 usually shows high-signal material within the pul￾monary interstitium, which is very often associated with
pleural effusion.
It has been demonstrated that despite the greater dose of
radiation that is given during CT as compared to chest
radiography, CT is preferable for the diagnosis of PL and,
more generally, for the diagnosis of pediatric interstitial
lung disease.
Lymphoscintigraphy is a mildly invasive technique that
provides valuable morpho-functional information

regarding the lymphatic system. It highlights the accumu￾lation of lymphatic fluid in the interstitial tissue that
causes swelling, which is most evident in the limbs. Lym￾phoscintigraphy is useful for evaluating lung lymph vessel
involvement by proving there is an accumulation of radi￾otracer in the lung and by providing evidence of back-flow
within the thoracic duct.
It is also useful for evaluating possible generalized, associ￾ated lymph vessel dysfunction by revealing delay, asym￾metric or absent visualization of regional lymph nodes,
"dermal back-flow", asymmetric visualization of lym￾phatic channels, collateral lymphatic channels, inter￾rupted lymphatic structures, and lymph nodes of the deep
lymphatic system.
Borderline disease may occur in the newborn. In these
cases, quantitative analysis, obtained by determining the
transport index, may increase the sensitivity and specifi￾city of lymphoscintigraphy in the very early diagnosis of
lymphatic disorders of the newborn.
Evaluation of pleural effusion: chylothorax is usually
diagnosed in the presence of pleural effusion with a trig￾Molecular pathways in Lymphangiogenesis Figure 1
Molecular pathways in Lymphangiogenesis. The four-step model for lymphatic vasculature formation is summarized in 
this scheme. Time line of endothelial cell gene expression in lymphangiogenesis refers to the murine lymphatic system. LEC 
competence is the autonomous ability of venous endothelial cells to respond to an inductive signal. LEC bias is the bias 
toward LEC determination and is characteristic of LEC precursors; LEC bias is eventually lost in other venous endothelial cells. 
LEC specification is characterized by initiation of LEC budding; LEC specification occurs when biased endothelial cells differ￾entiate. LEC differentiation is characterized by four different events, as shown in the figure. During this period lymphatic 
vessel differentiate and maturation occurs in a stepwise manner leading to the syntesis of all of the main lymphatic vessel com￾ponents to mature lymphatics. LEC: lymphatic endothelial cell. Timing: E means embryonic days. Lyve1: lymphatic vessel

lyceride level >1.1 mmol/L and a cell count >1,000 cells/
μL, with a predominance of lymphocytes (approximately
80%), according to the criteria drawn up in previous
reports. However, this is an unreliable diagnostic test in
malnourished patients and in patients not receiving
enteral nutrition, including the fetus and occasionally the
neonate. Without enteral feeding, not enough chylomi￾cron (the main triglyceride carrier) is produced to raise
chyle triglyceride levels. In these patients, a diagnosis of
chylothorax may easily be made by detecting lymphocytes
in the pleural fluid.
In the few cases in which lung function tests were per￾formed, they showed various patterns including restric￾tive, obstructive, and normal values. It is noteworthy that
pulmonary function tests were stable over time in the
patients who obtained multiple values.
Bronchoscopic evaluation, while not specifically indi￾cated in PL, may be useful for ruling out other pulmonary
pathologies, and for performing bronchial lavage to iden￾tify and isolate respiratory pathogenic organisms. No tra￾cheo-bronchial anatomical abnormalities were reported
in PL patients who were evaluated by bronchoscopy. Signs
of bronchitis are often reported.
Lung biopsy may be useful to demonstrate the presence of
dilated lymphatic spaces in the sub-pleural connective tis￾sue, along the thickened interlobar septa, and around the
bronchovascular axes.
Great care must be taken when interpreting lung biopsies.
In fact, the pathological findings in PL patients may
change a great deal over time, especially in case of viral
infection, and, more generally, may span from initial rec￾ognition of minimal evidence of lymphatic dilatation,
possibly related to a technical artifact (cross-clamping of
the lung), to proof of severe lymphangiectasia. In this
case, the lymphatic vessels are characterized by a thin wall,
devoid of smooth muscle, and with slightly dilated
lumen, lined by flattened endothelial cells. However,
severe clinical conditions frequently do not allow lung
biopsies to be performed, especially in newborns.
Post-mortem examinations of the lung may be difficult
and sometimes not very informative. Lung removal dur￾ing autopsies causes the lymphatics to collapse, thus pre￾venting the network of intercommunicating channels
from being evaluated. It is occasionally difficult to differ￾entiate PL from lymphangiomatosis by histological exam￾ination because both conditions have similar clinical
manifestations and the histology is occasionally similar
[31]. Pathological features of lymphangiomatosis include
a proliferation of complex anastomosing lymphatic chan￾nels that markedly expand the typical lymphatic routes
within the lungs and mediastinum. Compared to PL,

pediatric interstitial lung disease.

there is a prominence of collagen and spindle-shaped cells
surrounding the endothelia cell lined channels in lym￾phangiomatosis. In addition, in lymphangiomatosis there
is an increased number of dilated lymphatic channels,
whereas in PL the lymphatics are not increased in number.
Pleural effusions are common in lymphangiomatosis. In
addition, the evaluation of the affected tissues under the
microscope with the standard staining techniques (hema￾toxylin and eosin), it has been reported that immunohis￾tochemical staining is useful; antibodies D2-40 and CD
31 are excellent lymphatic endothelium markers [32]. PL
has also been associated with multiple congenital anom￾aly syndromes, including Noonan syndrome, Turner syn￾drome, Down syndrome [33-35], Frijns syndrome [16],
Hennekam syndrome [4,36], Milroy syndrome [16], and
Urioste syndrome [33,34,37]. A syndromic classification
of hereditary lymphedema has been recently proposed
[38].
Differential diagnosis
PL may be diagnosed during the prenatal and/or neonatal
period, or in older children or adults when it presents with
a milder course [2,3,6,39,40].
During the prenatal period, all causes leading to hydrops
fetalis have to be taken into consideration. Hydrops is the

end stage of a variety of diseases, and is reached through
three primary mechanisms i.e., congestive heart failure,
decreased plasma osmotic pressure, and obstructed lym￾phatic flow [14].
During the neonatal period, transient tachypnea of the
newborn, pulmonary aspiration syndrome and interstitial
pulmonary infection are well known and are usually
taken into consideration in the differential diagnosis of
respiratory distress syndrome in the neonate. Rarer condi￾tions must also be considered in the differential diagnosis
of chronic interstitial lung disease in infants, and include
surfactant protein B deficiency, desquamative interstitial
pneumonitis (familial and non-familial forms), pulmo￾nary alveolar proteinosis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis,
lymphoid interstitial pneumonitis, cellular interstitial
pneumonitis, and chronic pneumonitis of infancy. More￾over, other conditions that can mimic interstitial lung dis￾ease in infants and children should be considered. These
include persistent tachypnea of infancy, neuroendocrine
cell hyperplasia of infancy, acute pulmonary hemorrhage
of infancy, follicular bronchiolitis, pulmonary vascular
disorders (obstructive pulmonary venous disease, i.e.,
total and partial anomalous pulmonary venous return,
pulmonary vein atresia or stenosis), hereditary hemor￾rhagic teleangiectasia, pulmonary hemangiomatosis, vari￾ous systemic diseases, and metabolic lipid storage
disorders.
Finally, PL should be taken into consideration in the dif￾ferential diagnosis of children and adults with chronic res￾piratory symptoms and rare interstitial lung diseases,
including cystic fibrosis, gastroesophageal reflux, ciliary
disorders, collagen vascular disorders, pulmonary hemo￾siderosis, immunodeficiency syndromes, or hypersensi￾tivity peumonitis. It must be kept in mind that many of
the disorders listed above as pertaining to the neonatal
period may also have a later onset in childhood or even in
the young adult.
It must be said that chronic interstitial lung disease is a
challenging diagnostic clinical problem, which requires a
systematic and multidisciplinary approach.
Genetic counseling
The low number of reported cases does not permit con￾sistent genetic counseling to be performed. Most cases are
sporadic. Affected siblings have been described both in
cases of the isolated primary form, and occasionally in
various genetic multiple congenital anomalies. Male pre￾dominance in the primary form is reported, but data are
not entirely convincing.
In a recent review [38], pulmonary lymphatic dysplasia
was described in
• autosomal dominant syndromes: Yellow nail syndrome
– OMIM #153300, Noonan – OMIM #163950, Intestinal
lymphangectasia – OMIM %152800, Lymphedema/cere￾bral arterio-venous anomaly – OMIM 152900;
• autosomal recessive syndromes: PEHO syndrome –
OMIM %260565, German syndrome – OMIM 231080,
Hennekam lymphangectasia – OMIM %235510, Cam￾pomelia, Cumming type – OMIM %211890, Hypotricho￾sis lymphedema teleangectasia – OMIM #607823,
Knobloch syndrome – OMIM #267750, Urioste syn￾drome – OMIM %235255;
• X-linked syndromes: Lymphedema hypoparathyroidism
– OMIM 247410, Mandibulofacial dysostosis, lymphe￾dema syndrome [41].
The occurrence of PL in siblings, and the association with
a wide number of autosomic recessive syndromes would
make a recessive mode of inheritance a reasonable hypo￾thesis, although to date this has not been proved. When
PL occurs as part of other known syndromes, such as
Down syndrome, Noonan syndrome, or other previously
mentioned conditions, genetic counseling should refer to
the common recommendations that are usually made for
each known syndrome [33-37,42,43].
Antenatal diagnosis
Obstetric fetal ultrasound evaluation plays a key role in
the antenatal diagnosis of PL.
The conditions leading to a pathologic increase in intersti￾tial and total fetal body water may be correlated to con￾genital PL, and, more generally, should be correlated to
conditions that cause hydrops fetalis. Hydrops fetalis
must be taken into consideration in the presence of gener￾alized skin thickening of >5 mm, and two or more of the
following signs: placental enlargement, pericardial effu￾sion, pleural effusion, or ascites [5].
Any of these conditions may occur in cases of congenital
PL. Most studies on fetal hydrops, however, include cases
in which fluid accumulation is not present in all compart￾ments. It is generally assumed, in fact, that the etiology is
the same and that these cases represent an earlier stage of
the same pathological condition.
Although this is true for some pathologies, others lead to
an accumulation of fluid only in some compartments
(i.e., isolated ascites, isolated hydrothorax, or other iso￾lated conditions), without clear progression to general￾ized hydrops. Very early ultrasound recognition of
abnormal fluid accumulation often ends in premature
birth, thus generalized hydrops cannot fully develop. This
may generate considerable overlap in the literature among

hydrops, nuchal cystic hygroma, and accumulations of
lymph fluid in body cavities caused by dysplasia and/or
obstruction of lymphatic vessels [5].
Management including treatment
Treatment is generally supportive. At birth, in the presence
of severe respiratory distress associated with pleural effu￾sion, delivery room management could be a challenge
and multiple procedures might be required. Tracheal intu￾bation and assisted ventilation are usually necessary.
When effective gas exchange is not achieved, sterile thora￾centesis and/or paracentesis should be considered. Fluid
replacement, inotropic support and, in case of persistent
pulmonary hypertension, ventilatory management with
high frequency oscillatory ventilation and/or nitric oxide
may be necessary. Airway, chest wall, and pulmonary
edema, pleural effusion, pulmonary hypoplasia with
associated respiratory distress syndrome, perinatal depres￾sion, hypoxia, and acidosis are the main problems that
occur during delivery room resuscitation, and then during
birth stabilization.
The immediate, at birth evacuation of the pleural effusion
with assisted ventilation may lead to a favorable outcome
of respiratory distress.
Respiratory problems that occur in the post-neonatal age,
and that can continue over the next years of life, often
require home supplemental oxygen and symptomatic
treatment for recurrent cough and wheeze. A great deal of
attention must be paid to avoid bronchitis, since common
respiratory pathogens are usually involved. Cultures from
bronchoalveolar lavage should be done in order to start
selective antibiotic treatment.
In patients with rapidly expanding pleural effusion that
requires placing unilateral or bilateral chest tube(s), the
large amount of fluid (that is drained over days and
weeks) leads to the loss of great quantities of albumin,
immunoglobulin, and many other plasma factors that
must be replaced, in some cases even on a daily basis. Gas￾troesophageal reflux requires standard treatment.
Nutrition plays an important role in reducing lymphatic
production. Enteral nutrition with medium-chain triglyc￾erides and total parenteral nutrition have been success￾fully employed [2,3].
Octreotide and antiplasmin have been used in PL and in
intestinal lymphangiectasia. Non-univocal data are avail￾able regarding the effectiveness of these drugs [44-48].
When the chyle leakage persists (intractable chylothorax),
pleurodesis by instillation of sclerosing agents (talc, fibrin
glue, povidone-iodine) or parietal pleurectomy appear to
be effective. Pleurodesis may be associated with thoracic
duct ligation or suture of leaking collaterals [49-51].
Prognosis
Contradictory data have been reported regarding the out￾come. A recently reported series [6,17] stated that respira￾tory symptoms improved over time in the majority of
patients (8/9), including those who presented in the neo￾natal period (3/9). These data are in contrast with those
from a previously reported 11 patient series [17], in which
all patients who had been diagnosed during the neonatal
period died (6/11). It must be pointed out that in this lat￾ter study, 2/11 patients were born at <30 weeks' gestation,
and that another 4/11 subjects had complex cardiac
abnormalities. In the former study, the occurrence of car￾diac involvement was less severe, and included pulmo￾nary stenosis in 2/9 patients, and mild tricuspid
regurgitation in 3/9, including one patient who also pre￾sented pulmonary hypertension. When diagnosis is made
in childhood or adult age, the outcome is more likely to
be favorable quoad vitam [6].
Other small series and single case reports do not allow a
consistent prognosis to be established [2-4,15-
18,35,43,52-56].
Recent advances in intensive neonatal care have changed
the previously nearly fatal outcome of PL at birth. Patients
affected by PL who survive infancy often present medical
problems that are characteristic of chronic lung disease.
Gastroesophageal reflux and poor growth are also not
uncommon during the first year of life, especially between
six and twelve months of age, and are closely related to
chronic lung disease. If chylothorax occurs, a number of
components are lost, including fats (mainly phospholip￾ids, cholesterol, and triglycerides), proteins (mainly albu￾min, immunoglobulins, and fibrinogen), electrolytes, and
fat-soluble vitamins in concentrations similar to those
found in plasma, thus causing severe manifestations of
severe deficiency.
Unresolved questions
A better understanding of the molecular etiology of PL
may be reached through improved knowledge of the early
steps of lymphatic endothelial cell differentiation, novel
mechanisms of lymphatic vascular growth, maturation of
lymphatic vessels, and functional genomics of the lym￾phatic versus blood vasculature.
