Heart Failure
Heart failure (HF) is a growing epidemic, with an estimated 6.2 million 
adults (≥20 years) affected between 2013 and 2016 in the US.1
 The 
prevalence is increasing and is expected to reach 8 million by 2030.1
Mitral regurgitation (MR) is common in HF patients, especially in those 
with ischaemia, left ventricular (LV) dysfunction or dilated 
cardiomyopathy. MR in the absence of structural abnormalities of the 
mitral valve complex is called functional or secondary MR (SMR) as the 
problem lies with the ventricle. SMR is the most common form of MR 
and in 2011 its prevalence was reported to be 16,250 per 1 million in 
the US population – a total of 5.2 million people.2
It creates a vicious cycle of worsening HF and SMR – volume overload 
and dilated left ventricle (from HF) results in a dilated mitral annulus 
and tethered mitral leaflets (severe SMR), which in turn causes more HF. 
This cycle can be interrupted in several ways: 
• Medical therapy. 
• Transcatheter mitral valve repair with MitraClip (Abbott).
• Heart transplantation or LV assist device (LVAD). 
• Surgical intervention. 
In a meta-analysis of 53 studies and 45,900 patients, the presence of 
SMR was associated with an increased risk of cardiac mortality, HF, 
hospitalisations, transplant or death.3
 In this article, we discuss the 
aetiology, diagnosis and management of SMR in chronic HF.
Aetiology of Secondary Mitral Regurgitation
There can be multiple aetiologies of SMR in HF. They are usually related 
to the aetiology of HF, thus establishing HF as the primary basis of the 
disease. The aetiology of SMR includes:
• Tethered leaflet(s) due to ischaemic cardiomyopathy: MI and 
ischaemic cardiomyopathy can lead to regional wall motion 
abnormalities, most commonly resulting in posterior leaflet tethering 
and anterior leaflet override.
• Dilated annulus secondary to severe LV dysfunction and long-term LV 
ischaemic cardiomyopathy causing non-coaptation of mitral leaflets.
• Dilated annulus from dilated non-ischaemic cardiomyopathy with a 
similar mechanism as the previous aetiology.
• Papillary muscle dysfunction related to acute or chronic ischaemia 
secondary to coronary artery disease.
• Dilated left atrium where severe enlargement of the left atrium can 
result in a dilated mitral annulus and SMR.
Diagnosis of Secondary Mitral Regurgitation 
The initial diagnosis of MR may be based on a physical examination. 
However, the systolic murmur can be low-pitched and may be missed 
in cases of SMR. Echocardiography is the gold standard for the 
diagnosis of MR. It also helps to quantify the degree of MR based on 
established criteria. According to the American Society of 
Echocardiography, severe MR is consistent with: vena contracta 
Abstract
Secondary mitral regurgitation (SMR) is a common occurrence in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. Moderate-severe 
or severe SMR is associated with increased mortality and hospitalisations from heart failure. Medical and cardiac resynchronisation therapies 
have been the only treatments proven to improve prognosis in this patient population. The Cardiovascular Outcomes Assessment of the 
MitraClip Percutaneous Therapy (COAPT) and the Percutaneous Repair with the MitraClip Device for Severe Functional/Secondary Mitral 
Regurgitation (MITRA-FR) RCTs evaluated transcatheter mitral valve repair with MitraClip for treatment of SMR in addition to medical therapy 
and they had divergent results. The COAPT trial demonstrated that a reduction in SMR with MitraClip resulted in reduced mortality and heart 
failure hospitalisations along with improved symptoms and quality of life in appropriately selected patients. The MITRA-FR trial did not show 
any benefit from using MitraClip for patients with SMR. This article summarises the differences in these two trials and suggests a contemporary 
approach to the management of SMR.

EUROPEAN CARDIOLOGY REVIEW
Heart Failure 
width ≥0.7 cm; effective regurgitant orifice area (EROA) ≥0.4 cm2
; 
regurgitant volume (RVol) ≥60 ml; and regurgitant fraction (RF) ≥50%.4
The severity of MR is classified in grades as mild (1+), moderate (2+), 
moderate-severe (3+) or severe (4+). Moderate-severe or 3+ MR is 
defined by an EROA of 0.30–0.39 cm2
, RVol of 45–59 ml and RF 40–49%. 
The measurement of these parameters is difficult and requires 
experience and time. It can also be limited by measurement errors 
related to the patient’s body size and build. If there is discrepancy 
between the echocardiographic results and the patient’s presentation 
and physical exam, other modalities such as transoesophageal 
echocardiogram, cardiac MRI or left ventriculography can be used to 
determine SMR severity. 
Management of Secondary Mitral Regurgitation
Medical therapy
Medical therapy is the mainstay of treatment in patients with HF with 
reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) including those with SMR. In a 
recent study of 163 consecutive patients with HFrEF (left ventricular 
ejection fraction [LVEF] <40%) and grade 3–4+ SMR who received 
maximally tolerated guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT), 
SMR was assessed at baseline and after a median follow-up period 
of 50 months. Of the 31% (n=50) of the total group who had severe 
SMR at baseline, 38% improved to non-severe SMR (≤2+), while 18% 
of the non-severe participants progressed to severe SMR. Severe 
SMR, whether it was sustained or developed from non-severe SMR, 
was the most important independent prognostic determinant of 
major adverse cardiac events (defined as a composite of all-cause 
death and the need for heart transplantation or hospitalisation for 
HF and/or malignant arrhythmias), with an adjusted OR 2.5 (95% CI 
[1.5–4.3], major adverse cardiac events 83% versus 43%).5
 In a sub￾analysis of the Cardiovascular Outcomes Assessment of the 
MitraClip Percutaneous Therapy for Heart Failure Patients with 
Functional MR (COAPT) trial involving the 614 participants who 
presented with 3+ or 4+ MR at the start of the study, a reduction in 
SMR to <2+ was seen in 34% of those who were given GDMT.6
According to the American Heart Association (AHA)/American 
College of Cardiology (ACC) valve guidelines, GDMT is the first-line 
therapy for HFrEF and SMR (Figure 1) and the only Class I indication 
for treatment of SMR.7
 GDMT includes:
• beta-blockers to reduce risk of HF hospitalisations and mortality;
• angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) or angiotensin 
receptor blockers (ARB) to reduce risk of HF hospitalisations and 
mortality;
• angiotensin-receptor-neprilysin inhibitors (ARNI) to replace ACEI or 
ARB to reduce risk of HF hospitalisations and mortality;
• mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists for mortality reduction;
• hydralazine-nitrates in African-Americans for mortality reduction;
• ivabradine to reduce risk of HF hospitalisations; and
• diuretics to reduce congestion.
In addition to pharmacological management, cardiac resynchronisation 
therapy (CRT) should be considered in patients with New York Heart 
Association (NYHA) Class II–IV HF, LVEF ≤35%, normal sinus rhythm and 
left bundle branch block with QRS >150 ms. In these patients, CRT can 
also facilitate LV reverse remodelling and reduce associated SMR.8
Early involvement of HF teams is essential for quick optimisation of 
therapy in patients with SMR and HF. If medical therapy fails, other 
interventions can be considered depending on the patient’s condition.
Surgical Intervention
Surgical intervention for SMR has been tested in randomised controlled 
trials (RCTs) by the Cardiothoracic Surgical Trials Network (CTSN). The 
first CTSN trial compared mitral valve repair versus replacement in 251 
patients with severe ischaemic SMR. The investigators reported that 
mitral valve repair was associated with a significantly higher rate of 
recurrent moderate or severe MR (58%) as compared with mitral valve 
replacement (3.8%) at 2 years, resulting in more HF and cardiovascular 
hospitalisations. The LV end-systolic volume index (LVESVI) or LVEF 
were not significantly different during follow-up. Similarly, there was no 
significant difference in rates of all-cause mortality and major adverse 
cardiac or cerebrovascular events (MACCE) between repair and 
replacement groups.9
The second CTSN trial compared coronary artery bypass surgery 
(CABG) alone with CABG plus mitral valve repair in 301 patients with 
coronary artery disease and moderate SMR. The LVESVI and LVEF were 
similar in the two groups at 2-year follow-up. Moderate or severe MR 
was significantly higher in the CABG alone group (32.3%) compared 
with CABG plus mitral repair (11.2%). All-cause mortality, MACCE or 
rates of readmission and cardiovascular readmission were similar 
between the groups. The combined group had a higher rate of early 
neurological events, probably related to longer cross-clamp times and 
supraventricular arrhythmias.10
 The AHA/ACC valve guidelines give a 
Class IIb indication for mitral valve surgery in patients with isolated 
severely symptomatic moderate-severe or severe SMR.11
 However, 
none of these trials compared cardiac surgery to GDMT and these trials 
did not involve optimisation of medical therapy by HF specialists. 
Therefore, the role of cardiac surgery in isolated SMR remains uncertain. 
In patients undergoing CABG or another cardiac surgery, mitral valve 
surgery is considered reasonable for SMR (US guidelines – Class IIa; 
European guidelines – Class I [LVEF >30%] and Class IIa [LVEF ≤30%]).11,12
Transcatheter Mitral Valve Repair with MitraClip
Transcatheter edge-to-edge repair of the mitral valve with MitraClip has 
emerged as a catheter-based intervention for the treatment of SMR. 
This was recently evaluated in two clinical trials, Percutaneous Repair 
with the MitraClip Device for Severe Functional/Secondary Mitral 
Regurgitation (MITRA-FR) and COAPT, with different results.
MITRA-FR Trial
The MITRA-FR trial was a multicentre, randomised, open-label clinical 
trial of transcatheter mitral valve repair with MitraClip versus medical 
therapy in symptomatic patients with SMR conducted in France.13
 Key 
inclusion criteria were: severe MR defined as an EROA >20 mm2
 or RVol 
>30 ml/beat; ejection fraction (EF) 15–40%, at least one HF hospitalisation 
in the last year and patients were ineligible for surgery. Of the 452 
screened patients, 304 patients were randomised 1:1 to MitraClip 
versus medical therapy. The mean age of the participants was 70 years, 
60% had ischaemic cardiomyopathy, two-thirds had NYHA III–IV HF at 
baseline. The mean LVEF was 33%, mean EROA was 0.31 cm2
, mean LV 
end-diastolic volume (LVEDV) index was 135 ml/m2
 and mean 
regurgitant volume was 45 ml. 
Medical therapy was optimised by the local investigators. The majority 
of the patients were on loop diuretics, beta-blockers and ACEI/ARB/
ARNI. CRT was present in 30% of the patients in the MitraClip arm 
compared with 23% of the control arm. Of the 152 patients in the 
MitraClip arm, 14 patients did not undergo MitraClip implantation. The 
reasons for this included: operator unable to grasp the mitral valve

leaflets (n=3), cardiac tamponade (n=2), cardiogenic shock (n=1), and 
‘not attempted’ due to other reasons (n=8). Technical success was 
achieved in 96% of the patients with MitraClip implantation. At 
discharge, 91.9% of these patients had MR grade <2+. 
The primary endpoint of all-cause mortality or unplanned HF 
hospitalisation was similar in the MitraClip (54.6%) and control arms 
(51.3%; OR 1.16; 95% CI [0.73–1.84]). The results were similar in most of 
the major sub-groups such as LVEF <30% or >30%, EROA of <0.3 cm2
, 
0.3–0.4 cm2
 or >0.4 cm2
. While the group with an EROA >0.4 cm2 did not 
demonstrate a statistically significant benefit, the hazard ratio was 0.5 
in favour of the MitraClip group, albeit with wide confidence intervals 
due to the small number of participants in that subgroup. All-cause 
mortality (24.3% versus 22.4%) and HF hospitalisation (48.7% versus 
47.4%) were also similar in the device versus control arm, respectively. 
In the patients with available echo data during follow-up (n=89), there 
were no significant changes in end-diastolic volume, end-diastolic 
diameter, end-systolic volume, end-systolic diameter or LVEF. Recently 
published 2-year data showed similar results with no difference in all￾cause mortality (33.9% versus 35%), cardiovascular death (31.2% 
versus 32.1%), unplanned HF hospitalisation (58.7% versus 63.5%) or 
the combined endpoint of all-cause mortality and HF hospitalisation 
(64.2% versus 68.6%). Additional follow-up to 2 years was available in 
all patients who were still alive and shows the consistency of previously 
published 1-year findings. Of note, the rate of first HF hospitalisation 
was lower in the MitraClip arm between 1 and 2 years although this 
was not statistically significant.14
 In summary, the authors conducted 
an RCT of MitraClip versus medical therapy in a group of patients with 
severe HF, large and dilated ventricles and less than severe MR (defined 
according to current guidelines). MitraClip did not affect survival or HF 
hospitalisations at 1 or 2 years in patients who met inclusion criteria of 
MITRA-FR trial.
COAPT
The COAPT trial was a multicentre RCT in the US that randomised 
patients with symptomatic moderate–severe or severe MR to 
MitraClip and GDMT versus GDMT only.15
 The trial randomised 614 
patients over a period of 8  years and included 302 patients in the 
MitraClip arm and 312 patients in the GDMT arm. This final number of 
randomised patients (n=614) was increased from the initial target of

EUROPEAN CARDIOLOGY REVIEW
Heart Failure 
420 patients due to a higher than expected mortality in both arms. Key 
inclusion criteria of this trial were: moderate–severe (3+) or severe 
(4+) MR confirmed by an echocardiography core laboratory, EF 
20–50%, LV end-systolic dimension ≤70 mm, at least one HF 
hospitalisation in the last year and/or elevated B-type natriuretic 
peptide (BNP) >300 pg/ml adjusted for BMI, and not a candidate for 
mitral valve surgery at the enrolling centre. Patients with ACC/AHA 
stage D HF, haemodynamic instability requiring inotropic or 
mechanical circulatory support, evidence of right-sided congestive 
HF with moderate/severe right ventricular dysfunction and pulmonary 
artery systolic pressure >70 mmHg were excluded. 
The mean age of participants was 72 years, 64% were men and 61% 
had ischaemic cardiomyopathy. Mean values for echocardiographic 
data were 101 ml/m2 for LVEDV index, 31% for LVEF, 6.2 cm for LVESD 
and 0.41 cm2
 for EROA. The surgical risk was not high in one-third of the 
patients. The Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) score for the risk of 
death within 30 days after mitral-valve replacement was 7.8% in 
MitraClip arm versus 8.5% in GDMT arm. NYHA class II HF was present 
in 39% of the patients and NYHA class III was present in 52% of the 
patients. The percentage of patients on diuretics, ACEI, ARB or ARNI, 
and beta-blockers was similar to the MITRA-FR trial, however exact 
dosages were not available for comparison. MitraClip was not 
attempted in six patients. Of the 293 undergoing MitraClip, technical 
success was achieved in 98% of the patients. 
At discharge, 82% had <1+ MR and 12.7% has ≤2+ MR. The MR grade 
was ≤2+ in 92.7% patients at 30 days, 93.8% at 6 months, 94.8% at 1 year 
and 99.1% at 2 years. The primary endpoint of all HF hospitalisations at 
2 years was significantly reduced with MitraClip (35.8%) compared with 
GDMT alone (67.9%; HR 0.53; 95% CI [0.40–0.70]), translating into a 
number needed to treat (NNT) of 3.1. (Figure 2). All-cause mortality was 
also significantly reduced at 2 years with MitraClip versus GDMT (29.1% 
versus 46.1%; HR 0.63; CI 95% [0.46–0.82] – NNT 5.9). The results were 
similar in all the pre-specified subgroups based on age, sex, LVEF, LVEDV 
and surgical risk. The incidence of LVAD or heart transplant was 
significantly lower in the device arm compared with GDMT alone (4.4% 
versus 9.5%). All other secondary endpoints such as MR grade reduction, 
quality of life and NYHA class were significantly lower in the MitraClip 
group. The mean LVEDV increased by 17.1 ml in the control arm 
compared with a reduction of 5.1 ml in patients receiving the MitraClip 
(p<0.001). In summary, this large randomised trial reported that MitraClip 
reduced the rate of HF hospitalisations and all-cause mortality and 
improved 6-minute walk distance and quality of life in patients with 
moderate-severe or severe SMR who were carefully screened to 
determine that they were taking maximally tolerated GDMT. 
A recent sub-analysis of the COAPT data showed that reduction of MR 
to ≤2+ by either MitraClip plus GDMT or GDMT alone was associated 
with a significant reduction in risk of HF hospitalisation or all-cause 
mortality compared with MR ≥3+ (73.5%). There was no significant 
difference in this combined outcome between 0/1 (38.6%) and 2+ 
(49.8%) MR groups. At 30 days, 92.7% of the patients in the MitraClip 
arm had ≤2+ MR compared with 34.3% patients in the GDMT alone 
arm. In the MitraClip arm, the reduction in MR grade was stable at 
2 years follow-up but in the GDMT alone group with ≤2+ MR at 30 days, 
an increase in degree of MR to ≥2+ was noted in 30% at 1 year and 
66.7% at 2 years, emphasising the importance of close follow-up, early 
recognition and early treatment with MitraClip in patients who initially 
get better with GDMT alone.6
Consolidation of Data
MITRA-FR and COAPT trials randomised patients with SMR and HF to 
transcatheter mitral valve repair with MitraClip or GDMT alone. 
However, the results of these two trials are completely different. 
This has created vigorous discussion and speculation about the role 
of MitraClip in SMR. Explanations for the differences in the results of 
these trials include the following considerations.
Baseline Characteristics 
Size of the Left Ventricle
The left ventricle was significantly more dilated at baseline in the

MitraClip in Heart Failure 
EUROPEAN CARDIOLOGY REVIEW
provide a specific cut-off for clinical use. The impact of percutaneous 
mitral valve repair with MitraClip in patients with extremely large left 
ventricles and severe MR is unclear and needs further assessment. 
Based on the available data, using the COAPT criteria of LVESD <70 mm 
and EF >20% can be used as a starting point until more data is available.
Grade of Mitral Regurgitation Prior to MitraClip Placement 
The mean EROA was 0.31 cm2
 in the MITRA-FR trial compared with 0.41 
cm2
 in the COAPT trial. It can be postulated from the results of these 
trials that patients with a lower degree of MR may not benefit from this 
therapy as the change from pre-procedure to post-procedure will be 
less. In the COAPT trial, 255 patients were ineligible after initial screening 
because echocardiography criteria were not met which highlights the 
rigorous criteria for the trial.
The Hypothesis of More Benefit in 
‘Disproportionate Versus Proportionate’ SMR
A widely discussed hypothesis that combines LV dysfunction as 
estimated by the LVEDV and the severity of the SMR using the EROA 
was proposed shortly after the publication of the two trials. The idea is 
that at any given LVEF and RV, SMR that is more severe than explained 
by the LV dysfunction is ‘disproportionate’ and is likely to respond to 
MitraClip therapy while proportionate SMR is not.16
Optimisation of Medical Therapy
The percentage of patients on GDMT was high and very similar in both 
the trials, however the exact dosages were not available. In the COAPT 
trial, two HF specialists shared the role of primary investigator and an 
HF expert was involved at each enrolling site for optimisation of medical 
therapy.15
 On the other hand, local team members were asked to 
optimise HF as per ‘real world’ practice in the MITRA-FR trial.13
 As 
optimised GDMT has a significant impact on mortality and 
hospitalisations, optimisation of GDMT before the procedure may have 
affected the results. 
Procedural Characteristics
Procedural Complications 
Procedural complications, including device implant failure, transfusion 
or vascular complication requiring surgery, atrial septal defect, 
cardiogenic shock, thromboembolism/stroke, tamponade or urgent 
surgery were reported in 14.6% of the patients in MITRA-FR. Device￾related complications including thromboembolism, tamponade, 
vascular surgery, or urgent conversion to surgery occurred in 6.5% of 
patients. In COAPT, device-related complications were defined as any 
occurrence of single-leaflet device attachment, embolisation of the 
device, endocarditis that led to surgery, mitral stenosis (as confirmed by 
the echocardiographic core laboratory) that led to mitral valve surgery, 
implantation of a LV assist device, heart transplantation, or any other 
device-related event that led to non-elective cardiovascular surgery 
occurred in 3.4%. 
Effectiveness of Mitral Regurgitation Reduction
Post-procedure ≥3+ MR was present in 9% of the MITRA-FR patients 
versus 5% of the COAPT patients. At 1 year, this was 17% versus 5%, 
respectively. Residual MR ≥3+ is independently associated with 
increased mortality and HF hospitalisations, and the consistent results 
in COAPT may explain better outcomes.
Post-procedural Characteristics
Consistency of Mitral Regurgitation Reduction 
As stated above, reduced prevalence of 3+ MR in the MitraClip 
arm during follow-up in the COAPT trial may explain better 
long-term outcomes.
Close Follow-up with Heart Failure
Close follow-up with the HF team may have helped with further up￾titration of GDMT in the COAPT trial. Further substudies from the COAPT 
trial will help answer this question.

EUROPEAN CARDIOLOGY REVIEW
Heart Failure 
management. The following steps may help optimise the management 
of these patients (Figure 3):
• Meticulous assessment of the mitral valve in patients with HFrEF with 
both quantitative and qualitative assessment of MR. All 
echocardiograms should report the LVEDV, EROA, RVol and RF, which 
will help the general cardiologist recognise the need for treatment. The 
echocardiographic algorithm reported by Asch et al. at the 2019 ACC 
meeting is likely to become the standard for assessment (Figure 4).17
• Involvement of HF team or specialists early in the care of these 
patients. Optimisation of medical therapy including the need 
for CRT is important, ideally on an outpatient basis with close 
follow-up. 
• Right and left heart catheterisation to assess the filling pressures 
after medical optimisation. However, filling pressures should not 
determine the need for treatment as these are recorded at rest and 
may be higher with exercise.
• Consultation with an interventional/structural cardiologist to 
determine the candidacy for MitraClip.
• Optimisation with IV diuretics before and after the MitraClip.
• Continued follow-up with an HF specialist for management of HF.
Although there were only modest increases in GDMT in the MitraClip 
group compared with GDMT alone in COAPT due to the protocol 
instructions, it is quite likely that many patients who undergo 
transcatheter mitral valve repair with MitraClip will be able to tolerate 
higher doses of GDMT that were not previously tolerated. This would 
parallel the situation following CRT where the ability to up-titrate GDMT 
has been associated with significantly improved outcomes.18
Conclusion
Transcatheter mitral valve repair with MitraClip is the new gold standard 
for treatment of SMR. Based on the COAPT trial data, the relative 
reduction in all-cause mortality with MitraClip is the highest of all the 
available therapies including medications or CRT as shown in Figure 5. It 
has proven that correction of SMR in HFrEF with MitraClip reduces 
mortality, reduces HF hospitalisations and improves quality of life, NHYA 
class and 6-minute walk distance. Patient selection is the key to identify 
those who will benefit the most from this therapy. Patients with large 
dilated left ventricles, ≤3+ MR, severe irreversible pulmonary 
hypertension, severe right ventricular dysfunction, or those on inotropic 
support may not benefit. It is important to remember that 29% of the 
patients in the MitraClip arm in COAPT had died by the 2-year follow-up, 
emphasising the high mortality associated with SMR. Therefore, we need 
to identify the factors that can help in early diagnosis and treatment and 
continue to enhance GDMT as allowed following the procedure.
