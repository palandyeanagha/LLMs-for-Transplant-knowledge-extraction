Abstract
Background: Low bone mass is common in end-stage renal disease patients, especially those
undergoing hemodialysis. It can lead to serious bone health problems such as fragility fractures. The
purpose of this study is to investigate the risk factors of low bone mass in the hemodialysis patients.
Methods: Sixty-three subjects on hemodialysis for at least 6 months were recruited from a single
center for this cross-sectional study. We collected data by questionnaire survey and medical
records review. All subjects underwent a bone mineral density (BMD) assay with dual-energy x-ray
absorptiometry at the lumbar spine and right hip. Data were statistically analyzed by means of
descriptive analysis, independent t test and one way analysis of variance for continuous variables,
Pearson product-moment correlation to explore the correlated factors of BMD, and stepwise
multiple linear regression to identify the predictors of low bone mass.
Results: Using WHO criteria as a cutoff point, fifty-one subjects (81%) had a T-score lower than
-1, of them 8 subjects (13%) had osteoporosis with the femoral neck most commonly affected.
Regarding risk factors, age, serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) level, and intact parathyroid hormone
(iPTH) level had significant negative correlations with the femoral neck and lumbar spine BMD. On
the other hand, serum albumin level, effective exercise time, and body weight (BW) had significant
positive correlations with the femoral neck and lumbar spine BMD. Age, effective exercise time,
and serum albumin level significantly predicted the femoral neck BMD (R2 × 0.25), whereas BW and
the ALP level significantly predicted the lumbar spine BMD (R2 × 0.20).
Conclusion: This study showed that advanced age, low BW, low serum albumin level, and high
ALP and iPTH levels were associated with a low bone mass in the hemodialysis patients. We
suggest that regular monitoring of the femoral neck BMD, maintaining an adequate serum albumin
level and BW, and undertaking an exercise program are important to improve bone health in the
patients undergoing hemodialysis.

Background
Outcomes of chronic kidney disease (CKD) or chronic
renal failure (CRF) include not only progression to end￾stage renal disease (ESRD) but also complications of
reduced kidney function and increased risk of cardiovas￾cular disease [1]. ESRD requires some modalities of renal
replacement therapy such as dialysis or kidney transplan￾tation. The incidence of ESRD in Taiwan increased in the
last decade and reached the highest incidence of ESRD in
the world [2,3]. The prevalence of ESRD was 1706 per mil￾lion population in Taiwan, second only to Japan [2].
Nowadays more than 35,000 patients undergo long-term
hemodialysis in Taiwan each year [3].
ESRD patients usually have an accelerated bone loss due
to abnormal bone turnover that leads to a high prevalence
of bone health problems, e.g., osteopenia and osteoporo￾sis etc. [4-11]. Furthermore, parathyroid hormone (PTH)-
related bone disease influences bone mineral density
(BMD) in hemodialysis patients, in addition to other
important risk factors such as advanced age, age at
menarche, female gender, and history of previous frac￾tures, etc. On the other hand, protective factors for bone
mass loss in this population include body weight (BW),
hemoglobin, weekly heparin dose and a history of parath￾yroidectomy, etc. [7].
ESRD patients with a low bone mass usually have a high
incidence of fragility fracture [12,13]. The overall relative
risk for hip fracture was 4.4 for dialysis patients compared
with general population [12]. It's important to periodi￾cally evaluate the BMD in these patients. Nowadays dual￾energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is the most recom￾mended method because of its high precision and accu￾racy, a short scan time and a low radiation dose, in spite
of its relatively high cost and radiation modality. DXA is
reliable for evaluating the changes of BMD and bone min￾eral content at different sites [11,14]. Previous studies
demonstrated that the amount of bone loss in the femoral
neck (FN) is greater than that in the vertebra in ESRD
patients [6,9]. Most patients who have a low BMD value
in the FN have a higher risk of femoral neck fracture. Thus
the FN is the best site for BMD evaluation in dialysis
patients. On the other hand, Baszko-Blaszyk et al. [15]
suggested DXA measure of forearm BMD as another quick
and sensitive way to detect osteoporosis in peritoneal
dialysis patients, with FN BMD as a second choice.
Yamaguchi [16] advocated the distal radius as the pre￾ferred site for bone densitometry in CKD patients. How￾ever, Moe et al. [17] stated that the value of bone density
measurement in the evaluation of CKD-mineral and bone
disorder is not well established. Finding on the correla￾tion of BMD values to fracture risk in the CKD population
are inconsistent.
Since the osteoporosis is one of main bone health prob￾lems in the CKD patients and the incidence of hemodial￾ysis increased rapidly in Taiwan, this study aims to
investigate the status of BMD among hemodialysis
patients in Taiwan and to explore the associated factors
related to loss of bone mass.
Methods
This study was a cross-sectional correlation study and was
conducted in subjects undergoing hemodialysis at
National Taiwan University Hospital (NTUH) from
November 2004 to March 2006. This study was the first
part of a series of studies, and the second part was a study
on the effect of exercise program on BMD of hemodialysis
patients. The inclusion and exclusion criteria were defined
to fulfill the purposes of these two studies. There were 155
patients on hemodialysis in NTUH during the study
period. Patients with an age of 18 years or older from both
sexes who have been on hemodialysis three times a week
for more than 6 months were included in the study group.
Nine patients received hemodialysis twice a week, and 7
patients received hemodialysis less than 6 months, there￾fore 139 patients were included. The exclusion criteria and
the number of excluded patients were as the following:
(1) coronary artery disease, 13; (2) orthopedic disorders
exacerbated by activity, 10; (3) chronic lung disease result￾ing in shortness of breath during exercise, 4; (4) a history
of cerebrovascular disease, 4; (5) unable to communicate,
3; (6) blindness, 1. Subjects with fracture of the lumbar
spine or fracture of right hip were also excluded. There
were 104 eligible subjects. The principal investigator
invited the eligible subjects to participate the study and 41
subjects declined the request. The reasons included (1) no
interest, 19 subjects; (2) no extra time to receive BMD
measurement, 12; (3) disagreement by family, 10. Finally
63 hemodialysis patients were recruited into the study.
The participation rate was 41% (63/155). Written consent
was obtained from each subject. This study was carried
out with the approval of the institutional review board of
NTUH.
We used a structured interview questionnaire and
reviewed medical records of each patient to collect their
demographic data and dialysis-related information.
Serum albumin, calcium, phosphate and alkaline phos￾phatase (ALP) were measured every month, and the intact
PTH (iPTH) level was measured every 3 months on a reg￾ular schedule at this dialysis center. The measurement
procedures and reports were validated by the Division of
Biochemistry Laboratory at NTUH. Biochemistry data was
collected the same month as BMD measurement. The BW
was recorded on the day of the biochemistry check before
dialysis. The phosphate binders and vitamin D were giv￾ing to the patients to keep Ca and PO4 balances. No sub-

jects used calcimimetics or steroid during the study
period.
Based on the American College of Sports Medicine [18]
and Ehrman's studies [19], the intensity of exercise is an
important determinant for the efficiency of exercise and
heart rate is a good indicator to intensity. In subjects who
had regular exercise, the "effective exercise time" was
defined as the weekly total exercise time resulting in
increased heart rate, respiratory rate, or sweating. For
example, if a subject jogged for one hour twice per week
with increases in the heart and respiratory rates, the effec￾tive exercise time was equal to 120 minutes.
All subjects underwent DXA assay of lumbar spine (LS)
and right hip BMD by the same technologist who was cer￾tified by the International Society of Clinical Densitome￾try. The assay was performed using a fan-beam bone
densitometer (QDR-4500A; Hologic, Waltham, Massa￾chusetts, USA) [20]. Instrument quality control was per￾formed at least 5 days per week, and the coefficient of
variation (CV) for the total BMD was 1.0%. Based on the
World Health Organization (WHO) definition, the "nor￾mal" BMD is defined as less than 1 standard deviation
(SD) below the average BMD of a healthy young adult ref￾erence group, i.e. a T-score ^ -1.0; "osteopenia" as BMD
reduced by more than 1 SD but less than 2.5 SD, i.e. a -1.0
> T-score > -2.5; and "osteoporosis" as BMD reduced by
more than 2.5 SD, i.e. a T-score % -2.5 [21-23].
All data were statistically analyzed by means of descriptive
analysis, independent t test and one way analysis of vari￾ance with post hoc test (Scheffe method) for continuous
variables. The Pearson product-moment correlation was
used to explore correlated factors of BMD, and stepwise
multiple linear regression (stepwise forward estimation)
was used to identify predictors of low bone mass. Analyses
were performed using the SPSS statistical program, ver￾sion 11.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). All
tests were two-sided, and a p value < 0.05 was considered
statistically significant.
Results
Characteristics of subjects
Table 1 shows the demographic data of all 63 subjects.
The mean age of the subjects was 55.7 (SD 13.5) years.
There were 35 men (56%) and 28 women (44%), of
whom 21 were post-menopausal or permanently amenor￾rheic. There were statistically significant differences in BW,
body height, body mass index (BMI), and Kt/V in the gen￾der subgroups (p < 0.001, p < 0.001, p = 0.014, and p <
0.001 respectively), but no significant differences in age
and hemoglobin by gender. The hemoglobin level was
less than normal. Only 1 (3%) male subject and 6 (21%)
female subjects had hemoglobin levels in the normal
range. The serum ALP in 17 subjects (27%) and iPTH in
54 subjects (86%) were higher than normal and had a
wide range. The duration of dialysis averaged 38.8 (SD
9.8, range 6–202) months. Fifty-one subjects (81%) had
no previous bone densitometry. Three subjects (5%) had
fractures before starting renal replacement therapy, two in
the arm and one in left hip treated with a total hip arthro￾plasty. Six subjects (10%) had undergone parathyroidec￾tomy, and 3 (5%) had renal transplantation. There were
no statistically significant differences between these sub￾groups in the BMD and prevalence of low bone mass at
the LS and FN.
Bone mineral densitometry and prevalence of osteopenia 
and osteoporosis
The BMD in LS, FN and total hip (TH) sites and preva￾lence of osteopenia and osteoporosis of these 63 subjects
are shown in Tables 2 and 3. The correlation coefficients
between BMD values of FN and TH was high (r = 0.89, p
< 0.001). The correlation coefficients between BMD val￾ues in LS and FN (r = 0.59, p < 0.001) and the LS and TH
(r = 0.72, p < 0.001) were lower than those in FN and TH
but were still statistically significant. Men had a higher
BMD and T-score than women at these three sites. The
percentages of subjects with a low bone mass (including
osteopenia and osteoporosis) in the LS, FN, TH, and over￾all were 46%, 73%, 49%, and 81%, respectively. The prev￾alence rates of osteoporosis at the same sites were 8%,
10%, 5%, and 13%, respectively. Overall, the prevalence
rate of osteoporosis in women (21%) was higher than
that in men (6%). Of note, two men had osteoporosis at
the FN site only. In different age groups, those above 70
years had the highest prevalence of osteoporosis (22%),
followed by those 50–59 years (18%).
Associated factors of BMD
The Pearson's correlation among these nine variable (age,
BW, body height, albumin level, ALP level, iPTH level, Kt/
V, duration of dialysis, and effective exercise time) were
presented in Table 4. The BW was highly correlated to Kt/
V (r = -0.69, p < 0.001) and ALP to iPTH also had a high
correlation (r = 0.54, p < 0.001). When independent vari￾ables were highly correlated to each other, we should be
cautious to use them in the same analysis. The problem of
multicollinearity could occur [24], which would make
multivariate regression analysis inappropriate. We chose
BW and ALP level into the regression model testing
because BW and ALP level had higher correlation coeffi￾cient to LS BMD than Kt/V and iPTH level. All the inde￾pendent variables, except body height and duration of
dialysis, were significantly correlated with the outcome
variable (LS BMD or FN BMD). The age, serum ALP level,
serum iPTH level, and Kt/V had negative associations, and
the serum albumin level, effective exercise time, and BW
had positive associations with LS or FN BMD. For women,

BW had a positive association (LS p = 0.041, FN p = 0.012)
with BMD of both sites, but only age had a negative asso￾ciation (p < 0.001) with LS BMD. For men, only the serum
albumin level had a positive association (p = 0.037) with
FN BMD, and only the serum iPTH level had a negative
association (p = 0.020) with LS BMD.
Risk factors for reduced BMD
Table 5 shows statistically significant differences in BMD
at different sites (LS, FN, or TH) and subgroups. The
dependent variables were LS BMD, or FN BMD, or TH
BMD. For different sites, every factor was divided into two
levels and independent t test was used to define the possi￾ble risk factor. However the iPTH was divided into three
levels (normal, moderate, and high), and one way
ANOVA was used. If the difference was significant, then
Post Hoc test (Scheffe's method) was done. There was a
significant difference between moderate level and high
iPTH level (p = 0.042). For lumbar spine, the subjects who
were under 50 years old, men, women before menopause,
those in the first year of dialysis, those with an iPTH mod￾erate level in the 1.5- to 5-fold normal range, or those with
an albumin ^ 4.1 g/dl had a significantly higher LS BMD
values. For femoral neck, the subjects who were under 50
years old, those with an ALP < 330 U/l (1.5-fold normal
range), those with an albumin ^ 4.1 g/dl, those engaged in
impacted exercise, or those had effective exercise for at
least 60 minutes per week had a significantly higher FN
BMD value. For total hip, the subjects who were men,
women before menopause, those with an ALP < 330 U/l,
those with an albumin ^ 4.1 g/dl, or those had effective
exercise for at least 60 minutes per week had a signifi￾cantly higher TH BMD value. Men had a higher bone mass
than women, except at FN. Women before menopause
had a larger bone mass than those postmenopausal
women at LS and TH. There was no association between
regular exercise and BMD, but subjects who had effective
exercise for at least 60 minutes per week or engaged in
impacted exercise had a significantly higher bone mass at
FN.

While examining the distribution of the major variables
and their skewness indexes, the age, body weight, and
serum albumin level were shown to have normal distribu￾tion. The iPTH level, ALP level, duration of dialysis, and
effective exercise time were positively skewed. The skew￾ness indexes (= skewness/standard error of skewness)
were 8.12, 5.64, 7.69, and 9.88, respectively. These four
variables were transformed by the suggestions of
Tabachinck and Fidell [24]. The square root transforma￾tion was applied to transform the iPTH level. The loga￾rithm transformation was applied to transform the ALP
level, duration of dialysis, and effective exercise time. After
transformation, the skewness indexes for these four varia￾bles were 2.73, 1.75, 0.69, and 2.50, respectively. The
transformed data were used for regression analysis.
The possible risk factors and biochemical markers were
entered as independent variables in a stepwise linear
regression analysis. These included age, body weight,

cise time. The body height and duration of dialysis were
excluded because the linear curve-fit test was non-signifi￾cant. The analysis was used for FN BMD and LS BMD. The
scatterplots of residuals of dependent variables (FN BMD
or LS BMD) in these two regression models showed a
spread out distribution of the residuals against the pre￾dicted values. Thus, the assumptions of linearity, homo￾scedasticity, independence, and normality of residuals
were met on the major variables. Table 6 shows that three
variables, i.e., age, transformed effective exercise time,
serum albumin level, and age significantly predicted the
FN BMD; the standardized coefficients (β) were 0.324 (p
= 0.006), 0.278 (p = 0.017), and -0.291 (p = 0.013) respec￾tively. These three variables accounted for 25% of the total
variance (R2 = 0.25, p < 0.01). Another two variables, BW
and transformed ALP level, significantly predicted the LS
BMD; the standardized coefficients (β) were 0.338 (p =
0.005) and -0.285 (p = 0.017), respectively. These two var￾iables accounted for 20% of the total variance (R2 = 0.20,
p < 0.001). No other variable was found to have any sig￾nificantly predictive power. The standardized coefficient
on effective exercise time-log, 0.324, reflected change in
the mean FN BMD per 1-unit increase in effective exercise
time-log, if albumin level and age stayed the same. Simi￾larly the standardized coefficient on albumin level, 0.278,
reflected change in mean FN BMD per 1-unit increase in
albumin level, if effective exercise time-log and age stayed
the same. The standardized coefficient on age, -0.291,
reflected change in the mean FN BMD per 1-unit increase
in age, if effective exercise time-log and albumin level
stayed the same. The standardized coefficient on BW,
0.338, reflected change in the mean LS BMD per 1-unit
increase in BW, if ALP-log stayed the same. Similarly, the
standardized coefficient on ALP-log, -0.285, reflected
change in the mean LS BMD per 1-unit increase in ALP￾log, if BW stayed the same. When the standardized coeffi￾cient is high, the influence on FN BMD or LS BMD is high.
Discussion
Bone mass is a complex trait characterized by multiple
determinants, such as gene-environmental interactions
[25]. There are multiple factors determining bone mass
loss in the CRF patients whose bone quality and bone
quantity deteriorate rapidly. Our study found that the per￾centage of these ESRD subjects with low bone mass
(including osteopenia and osteoporosis) at the LS, FN,
and TH sites were 46%, 73%, and 49%, respectively. This
trend is similar to previous reports [7,9,26]. Although Taal
et al. showed that the prevalence of osteoporosis was
twice of our findings, both studies revealed FN as the
region with the highest prevalence of osteoporosis. Bone
loss in renal osteodystrophy was more prominent in the
FN than the LS or TH, which is compatible with previous
studies [9,26]. We found that the FN was the most likely
to show low bone mass, and only 27% of subjects had
normal bone mass. Only two men had osteoporosis, both
of whom were younger than 60 years old and had oste￾oporosis at the FN site. Gabay et al. [9] indicated that cor￾tical bone is more sensitive than trabecular bone to CKD￾related bone loss in women. Further study is needed to
clarify whether the difference is related to characteristics
of bone structure (cortical bone or cancellous bone).
The sudden decrease in estrogen level at menopause leads
to decreased absorption of calcium, increased osteoclast
activity and an accelerated bone loss [4]. In our study,
menopause proved to be an important risk factor for
decreased BMD in dialysis patients. Yang et al. [27] indi￾cated that there was a trend toward an increasing propor￾tion of coded osteoporosis with age, especially in women,
and women in the 50–59 year stratum had a 13-fold
higher proportion of osteoporosis than men. Yang et al.
[28] surveyed the incidence of osteoporosis in Taiwanese
women and found that the incidence in the ^ 50 years
group and total subjects were 11% (391/3582) and 10%
(473/4689) in the LS, and 8% (225/2732) and 7% (263/
3529) in the FN, respectively. In our study, there was a
similar trend in women, but not in men, and women in
the 50–59 years stratum only had a 2-fold higher propor￾tion of osteoporosis than men. In women, the incidence
of osteoporosis in ^ 50 years group and total subjects were
25% (5/20) and 18% (5/28) in the LS, and 20% (4/20)

and 14% (4/28) in FN. Our sample size was small and the
subjects were hemodialysis patients, which may be possi￾ble causes for these differences.
Our study showed that one of the three dialysis patients
with a history of fracture had osteoporosis and the other
two had osteopenia in the LS. This shows that fracture
occurs more frequently in patients with low bone mass.
One of the three renal transplant patients had osteoporo￾sis and the other two had osteopenia in the FN and two of
the three had osteopenia in the LS. The relationship
between bone loss and long term use of immunosuppres￾sive agents in transplant patients needs further study.
We found that BMD decreased as age increased and BMD
increased as BW increased in LS and FN. There were no
associations between body height and BMD at both sites.
It was compatible with other previous findings [7,28-30].
In our study, no association was found between the BMD
at these two sites and the duration of dialysis, compatible
with two other studies [6,31]. The discordance between
our results and previous studies may relate to the wide
range of duration of dialysis, previous parathyroidectomy
or transplantation in some patients in this study. Patients
who had dialysis for more than one year had a larger bone
loss than those with shorter durations of treatment but
this was statistically significant only for the LS BMD. A
relationship between bone loss and duration of dialysis
could exist, but wasn't detected by our cross-sectional
design because of the small sample size, the small quan￾tity of changes occurring in some periods that we still look
for. This also indicated that some other factors could not
be determined by BMD measurement, such as architecture
and bone turnover in different regions of the skeleton.
Our data demonstrated no correlation between BMD val￾ues with Ca, PO4, and the Ca, PO4 , and the Ca × PO4
product. Ersoy et al reported that the Ca × PO4 product
correlated negatively with lumbar T-scores and femoral
neck Z-scores in patients receiving peritoneal dialysis [32].
As markers of bone turnover, there were negative associa￾tions of ALP and iPTH with LS BMD, but non-linear cor￾relation with FN BMD. Taal et al. [7] showed that the FN
BMD had a negative association with iPTH. We found that
too high ALP and iPTH levels did not benefit bone mass,
but keeping medium high levels of ALP (1.5-fold) and
iPTH (1.5- to 5-fold) is helpful for maintaining bone
mass. A high iPTH level implicates a more bone resorp￾tion, while low to medium iPTH levels implicates a more
bone formation [4]. After dialysis, the relationship
between iPTH and low bone mass may become more
complex and are interfered with many factors. Because
bones of CRF patients may show resistance to parathy￾roid, the iPTH level must have a 2- to 3-fold of the normal
range to maintain normal turnover of bone [33]. Kaneko
et al. [34] reported that dialysis therapy for more than 3
years carried a higher risk (adjusted hazards ratio, 1.33)
and an iPTH value of 227–538 pg/ml, a lower risk
(adjusted hazards ratio, 0.68) of long-bone fracture. These
results supported our findings, and could be applied in
clinical treatment.
Osteopenia is commonly noted in ESRD patients. We
need to pay more attention to prevent bone loss in these
patients. This study showed that 51 subjects (81%) had
low bone mass, and 44 subjects (70%) were more than 50
years old, but only 12 subjects (19%) underwent BMD
measurements previously. Monitoring bone mass in dial￾ysis patients is important. Because bone loss is asympto￾matic, it is easily neglected. Since the risk of fracture
increases with low bone mass, the presence of osteopenia
should alert the clinician to pay more attention to their
bone health. We need to regularly measure BMD of dialy￾sis patients to find high risk patients to develop fracture,
which can lead to mortality and increased medical costs.
Three strategies may help reduce the burden of fractures in
dialysis patients: (1) Optimize the management mineral
metabolism; (2) Apply fall prevention strategies including
exercise training; (3) Consider the use of hip protectors in
high-risk patients [35].
From the risk factors and predictors of FN and LS BMD in
this study, we found that age, BW and the ALP level had
important effects. There were similar results shown in
other previous studies [7,29,30]. We also found that the
serum albumin level and effective exercise times were pos￾itively correlated with FN BMD in dialysis patients. The
relationship between albumin level and BMD has rarely
been reported. Lai et al. [29] showed that there was no
association with the serum albumin level and BMD in the
hemodialysis patients. Our study revealed that the
patients keeping an albumin level over 4.1 g/dl had a
higher BMD. Exercise is a non-pharmacologic way of pre￾venting bone loss. The impacted exercise would apply
loads to femoral neck, such exercise training leads to
increases in bone mass and showed significant effects on
FN BMD [36-38]. Our study indicated that regular exercise
alone is not a significant factor for preventing bone loss,
whereas both exercise type and effective exercise time are
important. The intensity of exercise was an important
determinant for prevention of involutional bone loss,
especially in the ESRD patients. Therefore, designing a
rehabilitative exercise program for hemodialysis patients
is also an important issue for them. With the modest R2 of
25% and 20% in our study, some other factors affecting
BMD need to be defined.
This study has some limitations. It was a single center
study with a small patient population and a low participa￾tion rate that precluded drawing a firm conclusion from

this clinical study because many unmeasured confound￾ers may have played an important role. The BMD survey
sites included the FN and LS only, but not the radius. The
inclusion and exclusion criteria were defined to fulfill the
purposes of the following exercise program study, thus the
subjects in this study were relatively healthy. The above￾mentioned limitations restrict the generalizablity of our
results. This cross-sectional study found some risk factors
of low bone mass in the hemodialysis patients. Prospec￾tive study may be needed to establish the factors that
cause low bone mass. A prospective study of the effects of
an exercise program on BMD in hemodialysis patients is
ongoing.
Conclusion
This is a cross-sectional study exploring the prevalence of
low BMD and its associated factors in 63 chronic hemodi￾alysis patients. We found a high percentage of reduced
bone mass in these subjects, and the most common
region of bone loss was the femoral neck. Advanced age,
low BW, high ALP level, and high iPTH level about 5 folds
of normal upper limit had adverse effects on maintaining
bone mass. Since bone loss is an asymptomatic process,
early identification of small reductions in bone mass is
very important to allow early intervention to prevent bone
loss. To assure the quality bone care, we need to monitor
the BMD of femoral neck regularly, to maintain a satisfac￾tory serum albumin level, as well as to promote an exer￾cise program.
