α-1 antitrypsin is synthesised in the liver and protects lung alveolar
tissues from destruction by neutrophil elastase.1α-1 antitrypsin
deficiency is a common autosomal recessive condition (1:1600 to
1:1800) in which liver disease results from retention of abnormal
polymerised α-1 antitrypsin in the endoplasmic reticulum of
hepatocytes, and emphysema results from alveolar wall damage.
The clinical consequences of α-1 antitrypsin deficiency in childhood
are haemorrhagic disease in infancy, cholestasis in infancy, or
chronic liver disease. Lung disease attributable to α-1 antitrypsin
deficiency does not occur in childhood, but is closely linked to
smoking in adults. Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis,
panniculitis, and necrotising vasculitis are associations with α-1
antitrypsin deficiency in adult life.2-4 Diagnostic methods are
summarised in table 1.

Diagnostic methods for identification of α-1 antitrypsin deficiency
Phenotypes
α-1 antitrypsin is a protease inhibitor, and commonPi variants have
been named by their electrophoretic mobility. PiM, of which there
are several minor variants, is the normal protein. PiZ, the mutant
responsible for more than 95% of cases of pulmonary and hepatic
disease associated with α-1 antititrypsin deficiency, is most frequent


in Scandinavia and progressively less common as one travels south
in Europe. PiS, by contrast, is most common in the Iberian
peninsula.5
Emphysema is associated both with null mutations (no protein
produced) and with mutations producing defective or non-exported
protein. Liver disease is associated only with those mutations that
produce a peptide which forms loop sheet polymers that are
retained in the liver, namely homozygotes for PiZ, PiM (Malton),
and the compound heterozygotes PiZ−, PiSZ, and PiZI.6 The
nomenclature of genetic variants is slightly confusing: presumed
homozygous abnormalities such as PiZZ are conventionally referred
to as PiZ unless the null gene has been excluded from the
phenotype; thus PiZ might actually be PiZ− (Z plus null), or PiZZ.
