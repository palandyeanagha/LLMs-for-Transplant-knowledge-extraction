Abstract
Background. Senile systemic amyloidosis (SSA) derived from wild-type transthyretin is a fairly common condition of old
individuals, particularly men. The main presentation is by cardiac involvement, which can lead to severe restrictive
cardiomyopathy. SSA is, however, a systemic disease, and amyloid deposits may appear in many other tissues but are
thought to be without clinical symptoms outside the heart. Amyloid is a very common finding in cartilage and ligaments of
elderly subjects, and transthyretin has been demonstrated in some deposits. Lumbar spinal stenosis is also a condition of
usually elderly individuals in whom narrowing of the lumbar spinal canal leads to compression of nerves to the lower limbs.
Results. We questioned whether lumbar spinal stenosis sometimes could be a manifestation of undiagnosed SSA. In this first
report we have studied the presence of amyloid in material obtained at surgery for spinal stenosis in 26 patients. Amyloid was
found in 25 subjects. Transthyretin was demonstrated immunohistochemically in 5 out of 15 studied resected tissues. Four of
the positive materials were analyzed with Western blot revealing both full-length transthyretin (TTR) and C-terminal TTR
fragments, typically seen in SSA.
Conclusion. We conclude that lumbar spinal stenosis quite frequently may be a consequence of SSA and that further studies are
warranted.
Key words: apolipoprotein A-I, lumbar spinal stenosis, senile systemic amyloidosis, transthyretin
Introduction
Lumbar spinal stenosis is a clinical syndrome of
usually elderly individuals that depends on narrowing
of the lumbar spinal canal (1). It is characterized by
compression of sensory and motoric nerves to the
lower limbs, leading to an often disabling condition
(1,2). The pathogenesis is probably heterogeneous
but includes disc degeneration with disc height
decrease and secondary facet-joint subluxation
leading to osteoarthritis. Also a degenerative spondy￾lolisthesis of the affected spinal segment may be
involved in most cases. Other central factors are
general degenerative processes in cartilage and
ligaments, including ligamentum flavum. Treatment
of lumbar spinal stenosis is often surgical at which
thickened connective tissue and osteophytes are
removed, leading to a neural decompression and in
most cases clinical improvement (3).
The nature of degenerative processes in connective
tissue such as ligamentum flavum is poorly under￾stood but obviously associated with aging. A number
of studies have shown that amyloid deposits are very
common in many ligaments, tendons, and cartilages
in elderly individuals (4-6). The importance of such
deposits is at present unknown.
Amyloidosis is a generic name for a very diverse
group of protein folding disorders, all characterized by
creation of cross-beta-sheet fibrils. At least 30 different
human proteins have been shown to form amyloid
fibrils in vivo (7). Two main groups of amyloid con￾ditions exist: systemic and localized. In the systemic

conditions, deposits occur in many organs and
tissues, and the diseases are usually life-threatening;
in each of these diseases one out of at least 15 plasma
proteins forms amyloid fibrils far from the place of
parent protein synthesis. In the localized conditions,
the proteins are expressed at the site of deposition (8).
In both groups, fibrils usually deposit extracellularly
and can form conspicuous masses that deform a tissue
and interfere with its normal functions.
Joint cartilage and ligaments are targets of both
localized and systemic amyloid. Of the systemic forms,
Ab2-microglobulin [for nomenclature, see (7)] amy￾loidosis is well-known to engage skeletal and joint
structures in patients under hemodialysis due to renal
insufficiency (9-13). A direct interaction between
the fibril protein and collagen I and II seems to be
important for distribution of deposits (14). Also
immunoglobulin light chain (AL) amyloidosis is
known to generate a variety of symptoms from joints
and skeleton, sometimes with neural lesions. Carpal
tunnel syndrome is often noted in transthyretin
(ATTR) and Ab2-microglobulin amyloidosis (15–17).
Systemic amyloidoses are comparably rare and are
included among orphan diseases in Europe. In con￾trast, site-specific localized forms of amyloid are very
common. Thus, medin (AMed) amyloid deposits are
seen in the aorta of almost every individual above
60 years. Some, but not all, localized amyloids are
associated with specific diseases. Well-known exam￾ples are Ab amyloid deposits in brain in Alzheimer’s
disease and islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) derived
deposits seen in the islets of Langerhans in most sub￾jects with type 2 diabetes (8); these two forms have been
studied extensively. In contrast, fairly little is known
regarding localized amyloid forms in joints and liga￾ments, and most studies have been focused on prev￾alence. Particularly knee (5) and hip (4,18–21) joints as
well as intervertebral discs (6,19,22) and ligamentum
flavum (23,24) have been studied in this respect.
Senile systemic amyloidosis (SSA), derived from
wild-type transthyretin (TTR), is common in associ￾ation with aging, although symptom-giving disease
usually is comparably rare and affects males at least
10 times more often than women. Restrictive cardio￾myopathy is the main clinical expression. However,
carpal tunnel syndrome is common in SSA, and
widely spread wild-type ATTR amyloid deposits at
other connective tissue sites have been demonstrated
(25). Since there are a few case reports on the occur￾rence of ATTR deposits in the spinal canal we
hypothesized that such deposits may be a cause of
lumbar spinal stenosis. We therefore collected
removed material from patients undergoing surgery
for this disease and analyzed it for presence and nature
of amyloid.
Material and methods
Resected material was obtained from 26 patients
undergoing surgery for lumbar spinal stenosis, and
this was the single inclusion criteria. Material con￾sisting of bone fragments and pieces of ligament and
other connective tissue was put in 0.15 M NaCl and
brought to the laboratory. After rinsing in 0.15 M
NaCl followed by distilled water, soft tissue parts,
including ligament, were dissected out and washed
again. Small pieces were put on a microscopic slide,
cut into small pieces with a pair of scissors and
thoroughly squeezed against another slide. After sep￾aration, the two slides were air-dried and stained with
alkaline Congo red (26). Tissue pieces were also fixed
in buffered neutral formalin and embedded in paraffin
for immunohistochemical studies. Material from two
of the patients was re-fixed in glutaraldehyde￾paraformaldehyde and embedded in epon (27).
Residual material was stored frozen.
Immunohistochemistry and immunoelectron microscopy
Immunohistochemistry was performed in all cases
where there was sufficient soft tissue material contain￾ing amyloid deposits. Deparaffinized sections were
incubated with antiserum 1898 against TTR50-127.
This antiserum recognizes both full-length TTR and
C-terminal fragments (28), typical of SSA, while
many commercially available antibodies do not
(29). Other sections were incubated with antiserum
159 or 167 for identification of apolipoprotein
A-1 (apoA-I) (30) or with mouse monoclonal
antibody Sne5 (31) for detection of protein AA.
After application of relevant secondary antibodies,
immunoreaction was visualized with 3,3’-diaminoben￾zidine-tetrahydrochloride. Immunoelectron micros￾copy with antiserum 1898 was performed as
described (27), and immunoreaction was shown
with 10 nm gold particles.
Proximity ligation assay
Since both TTR and apoA-I have been described as
amyloid fibril proteins in joints and ligaments, prox￾imity ligation assay (PLA) was performed with mono￾clonal antibodies to TTR (mouse monoclonal
prealbumin clone E-1, Sc 377517, Santa Cruz, CA,
USA) and rabbit antiserum to apoA-I (A159). PLA
was executed according to the manufacturer’s (Olink
Bioscience, Uppsala, Sweden) instructions. As posi￾tive control two different antibodies against TTR
(monoclonal antibodies as above and polyclonal
1898) were applied.

Western blot analysis
Fragments from ligaments were cut into small pieces,
washed thoroughly in 0.15 M NaCl followed by
distilled water and finally acetone, and air dried.
Materials were extracted with sample buffer, and
Western blot with the primary rabbit antisera
1898 (against TTR) and 159 and 167 (against
apoA-I) was performed as described (32). Reaction
was visualized with an enhanced chemiluminescence
system (GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden).
Ethical considerations
This study is of pilot character, and since we did not
know whether any results would be generated, we
decided to perform the investigations on de-identified
materials. Therefore we only have obtained sex and
age of patients. This study is in accordance with
Swedish law (the Ethical Committee at Uppsala
University Hospital was consulted).
Results
Typical amyloid deposits were identified microscop￾ically in 21 of the 26 specimens (Table I). The
morphological appearance varied considerably.
Some deposits were diffuse, weakly congophilic,
and not demarcated, while others were distinct and
often showed strong affinity for Congo red. The latter
commonly appeared as scattered small lesions.
In some cases, many distinct and often larger
deposits were found, particularly in tissue of ligament
structure.
Material was suitable for immunohistochemistry in
15 cases (Table II). There was a weak but inconsistent
reaction for TTR in some of the diffuse deposits.
Many amyloid areas were completely negative with
this antiserum. However, in five cases, distinct and
uniform TTR immunoreactivity was seen in many
deposits. These were strongly congophilic and exhib￾ited a typical green birefringence. Double staining
with TTR immunohistochemistry followed by Congo
red (26) showed complete overlapping (Figure 1).
Electron microscopy of material from two cases
with amyloid deposits showing TTR positivity at
immunohistochemistry revealed amyloid fibrils of
typical appearance at close proximity to collagen
and elastin (Figure 2). Such fibrils were immunola￾beled with anti TTR50-127 antiserum (Figure 2).
Since apoA-I has been found in amyloid of knee
joints (33), immunohistochemistry was performed
with an apoA-I antiserum in 10 of the cases with
amyloid deposits, with or without TTR immunore￾activity. In two of the studied materials a partial

was found (Figure 3). This finding raised the question
whether amyloid fibrils with mixed composition
occurred, and therefore PLA with one monoclonal
antibody against TTR and one polyclonal antiserum
against apoA-I were applied on sections of one of
the apoA-I immunopositive cases. The result was
completely negative, indicating that apoA-1 is not
an integrated part of the ATTR amyloid fibril. The
positive control with monoclonal and polyclonal
antibodies against TTR gave a strong signal as
expected.
Western blot analysis was performed with amyloid￾rich TTR-positive material from four subjects
(3 males and 1 female). Strong bands corresponding
to TTR full-length monomers and C-terminal
fragments, typical of ATTR in SSA (27), were
obtained in all cases (exemplified in Figure 4). These
patients were 82, 76, 72, and 77 years old, respectively
(mean 76.7 years). As a control, material was tested
from one 59-year-old woman with immunohisto￾chemically TTR-negative amyloid deposits. No bands
appeared at Western blot analysis.
Discussion
Very high prevalence figures have been reported for
local amyloid deposits in several different joints and
ligaments. However, it has been difficult to evaluate

the clinical importance of these often very small
deposits, and their genesis is completely unknown.
The amyloid has generally been believed to be of
localized nature and of limited interest, partially
depending on the high prevalence. There have been
attempts to analyze the nature of the amyloid, usually
by immunohistochemistry with the aid of antibodies
against known amyloid fibril proteins. Very few direct
biochemical studies have been performed. In one
investigation, based on formaldehyde-fixed material
from knee joint meniscus, apoA-1 was demonstrated
by mass spectrometry of extracts of amyloid deposits
(33). There was, however, no TTR found. Results of
a number of immunohistochemical studies have been
partially contradictory. In several immunohistochem￾ical studies TTR immunoreactivity has been demon￾strated in amyloid deposits in various ligaments and
articular tissues. In one paper 17 out of 50 hip joints
showed amyloid deposits, and all were reported to be
labeled with antibodies against TTR (20).
Sueyoshi et al. studied 36 specimens from patients
with lumbar canal stenosis and found amyloid in
material from 19 individuals. In 16 of these amyloid
was of a TTR nature (34). Those with amyloid
deposits were older than those without. The same
group reported one patient in whom development of
SSA was highly suspected (35). No further studies of
the amyloid protein were performed.
Our results show that small amyloid deposits are
extremely common in the tissues around the spinal
canal, not only in aged subjects. Quite evidently, these
amyloid deposits may be of heterogeneous biochem￾ical nature, and TTR is the major component in
relatively few. Interestingly, individuals with ATTR
amyloid were comparably old in the present investi￾gation, similarly to findings reported in a previous
study (34), which strengthens the suspicion of a
relationship with SSA. TTR in plasma is a homote￾trameric protein consisting of four identical about
14-kDa subunits. In amyloid of all patients with
SSA (and in a majority of those with hereditary
ATTR amyloidosis), fibrils are mainly composed of
C-terminal TTR fragments, in SDS-PAGE appearing
as a broad, about 8-kDa, band below the usually
minor full-length TTR band (27,36). Such a fragment
band was demonstrated in three of the four materials
analyzed by Western blot. Although it cannot be ruled
out that localized ATTR deposits with this composi￾tion may occur, this electrophoretic pattern can be an
indication that deposits around the spinal canal are
part of SSA.
SSA is known to manifest itself as a severe form of
cardiomyopathy of elderly men (37), but it is a systemic
disease with deposits in many organs (25,38). Renal
involvement is not rare although underdiagnosed and
may be of clinical relevance (38). Carpal tunnel syn￾drome is commonly associated with connective tissue
deposition of amyloid and has been suggested some￾times to be a first sign of SSA (39). Carpal tunnel
syndrome has been reported to occur up to decades
before other symptoms of disease in mutant ATTR
amyloidosis, such as the Danish TTR L111M muta￾tion (40). From our present results it seems very likely
that spinal stenosis is another not uncommon result of
SSA. Therefore, cardiac evaluation with echocardiog￾raphy may be warranted in patients with spinal steno￾sis, at least in elderly men.
Another interesting and potentially important
question is whether there is an increased risk of
amyloid-generated spinal stenosis in hereditary
amyloidosis of TTR origin. Hereditary ATTR amy￾loidosis is phenotypically highly heterogeneous and
often clinically overlapping with SSA, e.g. in cardiac
and carpal tunnel manifestations. Further studies of
this possibility are necessary.
