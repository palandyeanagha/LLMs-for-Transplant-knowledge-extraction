SUMMARY In this study we have ultrasonographically assessed the prevalence of sludge in a
group of 48 fasting patients after gastrointestinal tract surgery. Ultrasound examinations were
carried out daily in each patient, beginning on the day before surgery. The period of fasting lasted
from seven to 10 days. The presence of sludge was demonstrated within the seventh day in seven
out of the 48 patients. In 38 cases fast lasted for a further three days. The total number of
sludge-positive patients after 10 days was 12 out of 38. Ultrasound controls were performed after
six and 12-24 month interval and showed the presence of gall stones with different
ultrasonographic patterns in three sludge positive patients. We conclude that in the early
postoperative period there is a high risk for sludge development and that in some cases sludge
may subsequently evolve into gall stones.
Very recent papers' 2 have reported a high fre￾quency of gall bladder disease in patients on
long-term parenteral nutrition (TPN). In particular,
the presence of gall bladder sludge is strictly related
to the duration of TPN and it may result in eventual
gall stone formation.2 The enhanced risk of gall
bladder disease in these patients has been ascribed
to bowel rest and gall bladder stasis.
In 1981 we decided to undertake a prospective
study using sequential ultrasound examinations to
assess the prevalence of gall bladder sludge and
lithiasis in patients submitted to prolonged fasting
after gastrointestinal surgery. This clinical condition
is similar to TPN in that there is an absence of oral
feeding, but the composition of the intravenously
administered fluids is substantially different. The
absence of a meaningful caloric intake and prior
anaesthesia and abdominal surgery make this group
of patients distinctive.
Methods
PATIENTS
To study the effect of prolonged fasting on the
formation of biliary sludge, we selected a group of

patients who were about to undergo gastrointestinal
surgery.
Conditions necessary for admission to this
prospective study were: (1) absence of gall bladder
disease, as assessed by a previous ultrasonographic
study; (2) no laboratory alterations in liver function
tests (GOT, GPT, alkaline phosphatase,
gamma-glutamil-transpeptidase); (3) no administra￾tion of opiates or anticholinergic drugs either before
operation or in the early postoperative period.
A total of 48 patients (23 men, 25 women; aged
32-83 years, mean 626±+13 3 years) were examined.
Mild diabetes was detected before the operation in
10 out of 48 patients. None of them was treated with
insulin. Abnormal rises in serum cholesterol and/or
triglycerides were found in 13 patients. Nineteen of
these patients had an upper gastrointestinal tract
operation (16 partial gastrectomy, three total gas￾trectomy) and 29 were operated on the lower
gastrointestinal tract (two colonic resection, seven
right emicolectomy, nine left emicolectomy, 11
amputations of the rectum). The final diagnosis of
each patient is reported in Table 1.
The period of fasting began the day before the
operation and lasted for at least seven days. In 38 of
the patients fasting continued for 10 days. In all
patients the following amount of intravenous fluids
were administered daily for the total fasting period:
glucose 5% solution, 500 ml; fructose 5% solution,

administered every two days.
ULTRASOUND STUDY OF THE GALL BLADDER
Ultrasound examination was always carried out at
the patients' bedside using a high resolution real￾time scanner with a 3*5 MHz linear array trans￾ducer. In all cases the examinations began the day
before surgery (after overnight fasting) and were
sequentially carried out every day in the early
morning during the fasting period and for at least
five days after oral refeeding was started. Ultra￾sonography was also repeated after a six month
interval in all patients in whom gall bladder sludge
was observed.
A further ultrasonographic control was performed
in 28 of the 48 patients after a 12-24 month interval.
The remaining 20 patients dropped out of the study.

STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
To identify factors other than the duration of the
fast that might influence the formation of sludge, we
used x2 analysis to compare the rate of sludge
formation in the following subgroups: (a) men and
women; (b) patients with upper and lower gastro￾intestinal tract operations; (c) diabetic and non￾diabetic patients; (d) normal and abnormal serum
triglycerides and cholesterol. Using Student's t test,
we also compared age and duration of anaesthesia in
sludge-negative and sludge-positive patients.
Results
The presence of gall bladder sludge was shown
within the seventh day in seven of the 48 patients
(14X5%). Six of the patients with sludge and 32
without sludge remained fasting for a further three
days. Between the seventh and the 10th day sludge
developed in another six patients among the 32 who
had been negative during the first period of study
(Fig. 1). Therefore, the total number of sludge￾positive patients after 10 days of fasting was 12 out
of 38 (31.6%).
After oral refeeding the quantity of sludge within
the gall bladder lumen tended to decrease, but
complete disappearance was observed in only three
patients after five days of oral refeeding.
The 13 sludge-positive patients were reexamined
after six months and highly echogenic foci, inter￾preted as gall stones, were found in three cases, the
remaining 10 showing completely normal gall blad￾ders. These patients were asymptomatic and no

alterations of the gall bladder wall suggestive of
cholecystitis were seen at ultrasonography. In one
case sharp acoustic shadows were present behind the
echogenic foci while in the other two cases the
shadows were less or not evident (Fig. 2).
Ultrasound controls was performed after a 12-24
month interval in 28 out of the 48 patients. Eighteen
of these patients had been sludge-negative and 10
sludge-positive in the early postoperative period.
Two patients of this group had been found to have
gall stones at the six month control while the third
patient had died from metastatic involvement of the
liver.
This control revealed gall stones in only two
patients in whom they had previously been shown.
In certain cases, the formation of sludge was
associated with some abnormal physical or labora￾tory characteristics (Table 2). In relation to the sex
of the patients, the prevalence of sludge was higher
in women (36%; nine of 25) than in men (17.4%;
four of 23), but this difference, analysed by x2
method, was not significant. No difference was
found, using Student's t test, in the mean (±SD) age
of sludge-positive (64.3±9.2) and sludge-negative
patients (61.6±14.6).
Sludge formation was similar in diabetic (30%;
three of 10) and non-diabetic patients (26 3%; 10 of
38). On the contrary, a higher prevalence of sludge
was found in patients with serum cholesterol and/or
triglyceride alterations (38.5%; five of 13) than in
normal patients (22.9%; eight of 35), but this
difference was not significant using the x2 method.
The other major factor which may influence the
formation of sludge in our group of patients could be
related to the type of operation and the duration of
the anaesthesia. Surgery on the upper gastro￾intestinal tract was followed by sludge formation in a
higher percentage of cases (36.8%; seven of 19) than

significantly influence sludge formation (Table 2).
Discussion
This prospective study provides valuable evidence of
the relationship between prolonged fasting and gall
bladder sludge formation in a group of patients who
underwent gastrointestinal surgery.
A similar findings has been described by Messing
et a12 during prolonged total parenteral nutrition
(TPN). These authors found, that sludge formation
was infrequent during the first three-week period of
TPN, but constant in all patients on TPN for a

Gall bladder sludge formation during prolonged fasting
period over six weeks. In that study, sonograms
taken on the 12th day±two days (mean±SEM) did
not show evidence of sludge in any patient. On the
contrary, in our group of patients daily ultrasound
examinations detected sludge in seven out of 48
cases (14-5%) after only seven days of fasting. As
shown for the duration of TPN, the period of fasting
play a fundamental role in the development of
sludge. Six patients, who were sludge-negative
during the first period, became sludge-positive
between the seventh and tenth days of fasting.
As hypothesised for TPN, we believe that sludge
formation is essentially induced by gall bladder
hypotonicity and stasis after suppression of oral food
intake. The period of time necessary for sludge
formation, however, is significantly lower in our
group of patients than in TPN. This may be
explained by taking into account that factors other
than the suppression of meal induced contractility
are involved. Gall bladder hypotonicity may be
enhanced by the paralytic effect of abdominal
surgery and anaesthesia. In addition, it is known
that dilatation of the gall bladder occurs in the late
postoperative period after elective gastric surgery,3
presumably because of inadvertent sectioning of the
hepatic branch of the vagus nerve.4
The influence of fasting on the composition of
hepatic5 and gall bladder6 bile in humans has already
been studied for a period of 10-20 hours: gall
bladder bile is significantly supersaturated after 15
hours, but cholesterol saturation falls after 20 hours
of fasting.6 No data are available on gall bladder bile
modifications for a period of fasting as long as we
have studied.
In our group of patients, sludge formation may
also be favoured by bile stratification and sedi￾mentation of its components as shown by Tera7 in in
vivo and in vitro studies. Ultrasonographic findings
are in agreement with this hypothesis because sludge
appears as a collection of fine echoes lying in the
most dependent part of the gall bladder and with a
lower intensity than those produced by gall stones.
It has been experimentally shown8 that highly
viscous desiccated bile appears echogenic, and it is
commonly accepted that biliary sludge is essentially
thick bile. In vitro studies suggest that the echoes of
biliary sludge originate from pigment granules9 or
cholesterol crystals.10
As sludge did not develop in all patients fasting
for seven-10 days, we investigated some other
factors which may influence sludge formation. The
higher trends of sludge formation in women and in
type IIb hyperlipoproteinemic patients are probably
because of the same mechanism which induces a
higher prevalence of gall stones in these patients;"
upper gastrointestinal tract surgery might cause
more significant gall bladder hypotonicity than
lower gastrointestinal tract surgery through an
accidental vagal injury.
The follow up of the sludge-positive patients,
after oral refeeding was initiated, showed that the
disappearance of the sludge was not immediate.
This datum is in agreement with the findings of
Messing2 in TPN patients. Echogenic foci inter￾preted as stones (Fig. 3) were seen within the gall
bladder of three sludge-positive patients six months
after surgery and were confirmed in two of these
patients examined after a 12-24 month interval. In

two cases, however, the ultrasound patterns of
stones was not typical, as acoustic shadows were not
displayed behind the stones. These findings are very
similar to those described by Britten et al1 as 'sludge
balls' and may represent an early evolutive stage of
gall stones.
The finding of stones in only three cases out of 13
sludge-positive patients shows that supersatured bile
and sludge occurring during prolonged fasting, are a
necessary, but not a sufficient, cause for gall stones
formation. Differences in cholesterol crystal forma￾tion (nucleation time)13 14 may explain why stones
developed only in some patients and not in others.
The occurrence of acute acalculous cholecystitis is
reported in patients undergoing prolonged TPN.1 15
This event was never observed in our group of
fasting patients after surgery. It is possible that a
longer period of gall bladder stasis, or the contribu￾tion of other factors, is necessary for the occurrence
of acute acalculous cholecystitis.
In conclusion this study supports the hypothesis
that the prolonged suppression of oral food intake in
patients operated on the gastrointestinal tract,
resulting in absence of meal stimulated gall bladder
contraction, may be an important prerequisite to
sludge development in this group of patients.
