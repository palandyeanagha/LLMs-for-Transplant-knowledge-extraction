ABSTRACT
Gut microbiota plays a significant role in the development of hepatocellular 
carcinoma (HCC) in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). However, understanding 
of the precise mechanism of this process remains incomplete. A new class 
steatohepatitis-inducing high-fat diet (HFD), namely STHD-01, can promote the 
development of HCC without the administration of chemical carcinogens. Using this 
diet, we comprehensively analyzed changes in the gut microbiota and its metabolic 
functions during the development of HCC in NASH. Mice fed the STHD-01 developed 
NASH within 9 weeks. NASH further progressed into HCC by 41 weeks. Treatment 
with antibiotics significantly attenuated liver pathology and suppressed tumor 
development, indicating the critical role of the gut microbiota in tumor development 
in this model. Accumulation of cholesterol and bile acids in the liver and feces 
increased after feeding the mice with STHD-01. Treatment with antibiotics did not 
reverse these phenotypes. In contrast, accumulation of secondary bile acids was 
dramatically reduced after the treatment with antibiotics, suggesting the critical 
role of the gut microbiota in the conversion of primary bile acids to secondary bile 
acids. Secondary bile acids such as deoxycholic acid activated the mTOR, pathway in 
hepatocytes. Activation of mTOR was observed in the liver of mice fed STHD-01, and 
the activation was reduced when mice were treated with antibiotics. Collectively, 
bile acid metabolism by the gut microbiota promotes HCC development in STHD-01-
induced NASH.
INTRODUCTION
The number of patients with non-alcoholic fatty 
liver disease (NAFLD) has been increasing in the recent 
years [1]. In patients with NAFLD, dysregulation of 
adipokines, insulin resistance, and dyslipidemia lead to 
fat accumulation in the liver [2–4]. Activation of Kupffer 
cells and hepatic stellate cells in NAFLD patients elicits 
inflammation and fibrogenesis in the liver, leading to the 
development of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). 
Approximately 10% of NAFLD patients develop NASH. 
In addition, around 10% of NASH patient further develop 
liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) [5–7]. 
Thus, the prevalence of NASH-associated HCC has been 
gradually increasing in the recent years [8–11]. Although 
HCC is the fifth most common malignant tumor in the 
world, the precise mechanisms by which NASH causes 
HCC are not entirely understood [1–13].

It has been reported that various kinds of genetic 
and environmental factors are involved in the development 
and progression of HCC in NASH. Several animal 
models of NASH-associated HCC are available to study 
the mechanisms of carcinogenesis. For example, lack of 
certain genes such as melanocortin 4 receptor (Mc4r) and 
lacking the tumor suppressor tuberous sclerosis complex 
(Ltsc1) leads to the development of spontaneous HCC 
in mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) [12, 13]. Likewise, 
long-term feeding of mice with HFD can promote the 
development of HCC in NASH [14, 15]. Although these 
models are used to investigate the mechanisms of HCC 
development, they also have limitations. For instance, 
in humans, individuals who do not show variations in 
those genes are still able to develop HCC. The latter 
model requires treatment with carcinogenic chemicals in 
addition to HFD, such as 7,12-dimethylbenzanthracene 
(DMBA), to induce HCC development in NASH [14, 
16]. Thus, additional animal models that mimic the 
physiological course of HCC development in humans are 
essential to fully understand the mechanism of NASH￾associated HCC. Increasing evidence has highlighted 
the critical role of the gut microbiota and its metabolites 
in the development of HCC in NASH. For example, 
the gut microbial metabolites promote the secretion of 
senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) factors 
that facilitate HCC development in hepatic stellate cells 
(HSCs) [14]. Lipoteichoic acids, which are components of 
cell walls of gram-positive commensal bacteria, promote 
the production of prostaglandin (PG) E2
 by HSCs. The 
produced PGE2
 suppresses the antitumor effect of CD8+ 
T cells, thereby facilitating liver carcinogenesis [16]. Mice 
fed the choline-deficient high-fat diet (MCHFD) show 
increased systemic translocation of lipopolysaccharide 
(LPS) when treated with dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) 
[17]. The systemic dissemination of gut-derived LPS leads 
to liver inflammation and fibrogenesis, eventually causing 
liver carcinogenesis [17]. On the contrary, administration 
of probiotic bacteria regulates the immune cell balance in 
the gut, thus decreasing the risk of liver carcinogenesis 
[18]. 
A recent study has reported a new class of HFD, 
steatohepatitis-inducing HFD (STHD)-01, which contains 
an increased amount of fatty acids and cholesterol, as 
compared to commonly used conventional HFDs [19]. It 
is noteworthy that feeding mice with STHD-01 promotes 
the development of severe NASH pathology within 9 
weeks, while conventional HFD requires more than 24 
weeks to develop an equivalent level of NASH [20]. More 
strikingly, this diet facilitates the progression of HCC from 
NASH without administration of carcinogenic chemicals 
[19]. Thus, this new class of HFD can mimic natural 
course of HCC development in NASH as seen in humans. 
Hence, in the current study, we use STHD-01 as a model 
of NASH-associated HCC. By feeding mice this diet, we 
comprehensively analyzed the alteration of gut microbiota 
and its metabolites to determine the potential mechanisms 
by which HFD alone causes NASH-associated HCC.
RESULTS
STHD-01 promotes the development of NASH￾associated HCC
SPF C57BL/6J mice were fed a control (CONT) 
standard (SD) diet (CONT), STHD-01 (STHD-01), or 
STHD-01 plus antibiotics (Abx; STHD-01+Abx) for 41 
weeks (Figure 1A). Total calorie intake between the three 
groups was not different (Figure 1B). STHD-01-fed mice 
showed increased liver mass without an increase in the 
body weight (Figure 1B). Triiodothyronine (T3), a thyroid 
hormone metabolized from thyroxin (T4), was elevated 
in the STHD-01 group (Figure 1B). The STHD-01 + 
Abx group showed increased body weight and T3 levels 
(Figure 1B). After 41 weeks of STHD-01 feeding, mice 
developed NASH and HCC (Figure 2A). Liver histology 
demonstrated a certain degree of age-dependent steatosis 
in the CONT group (Figure 2A). In STHD-fed mice, there 
were characteristics of carcinoma and liver dysplasia, 
such as ballooning, macrophage infiltration, and hepatic 
fibrogenesis, observed by Azan staining (Figure 2A). 
Moreover, the STHD-01 group displayed typical features 
of carcinoma, such as liver cell dysplasia and atypia, and 
monotonous clear cell changes, (Figure 2A). Notably, 
the number and size of tumors reduced significantly 
after treatment with antibiotics, indicating that the gut 
microbiota contributes to hepatocarcinogenesis in this 
model. These inflammatory features, caused by STHD-01, 
were significantly attenuated, and liver tumor development 
was dramatically attenuated when mice were treated with 
antibiotics (STHD-01 + Abx group) (Figure 2A). The 
liver injury markers aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and 
alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and the transcription of 
pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor nuclear factor 
(Tnf)-α and interleukin (Il)-1β increased significantly in 
the STHD-01 group, and these effects were dramatically 
suppressed by antibiotic treatment (Figure 2B). Upon the 
feeding of STHD-01, marked infiltration of CD11bhigh
CD11clow inflammatory macrophages was observed in 
the liver (Supplementary Data 1). Since these cells were 
significantly decreased by the treatment of antibiotics, 
macrophage infiltration might contribute to the induction 
of liver inflammation. The transcription of fibrogenesis 
markers α-smooth muscle antigen (α-SMA), a1 type 
1 collagen (Col1α1), and transforming growth factor 
(Tgf)-β was not altered by administration of antibiotics 
(Figure 2B). Next, we examined the effect of STHD-01 
on the gut microbiota. As shown in Figure 2C, STHD￾01 did not affect the total number of bacteria, whereas 
antibiotic treatment markedly reduced the total number 
of gut bacteria by more than 100-fold. STHD-01-fed 

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget 9927 Oncotarget
mice showed an increased abundance of Bacteroides 
and Clostridium cluster XVIII. In contrast, numbers of 
Streptococcus, Bifidobacterium, and Prevotella decreased 
in the mice fed STHD-01 (Figure 2C). In the STHD-01 
+ Abx group, Enterococcus was predominant in the gut 
microbiota (Figure 2C).
Bile acid metabolism is altered by STHD-01
STHD-01 contains a significant amount of 
cholesterol, which might influence the development of 
NASH-associated HCC [19, 20]. Hence, we next examined 
the extent to which the feeding with STHD-01 leads to 
the accumulation of cholesterol and its downstream 
catabolites, bile acids. Figure 3A shows the examined bile 
acid synthesis pathway, starting from cholesterol. STHD￾01 led to an accumulation of cholesterol in the liver after 
both 9 weeks and 41 weeks after feeding, as expected 
(Figure 3B). In parallel, STHD-01 led to increased 
transcription of a bile acid synthesis enzyme, cytochrome 
P450 (Cyp) 7a1, in the liver (Supplementary Data 2). 
Other Cyp genes, such as Cyp7b1, Cyp27a1, and Cyp8b1, 
were not up-regulated upon feeding with STHD-01 
(Supplementary Data 2). Consistent with the accumulation 
of cholesterol in the liver, concentration of total bile acids 
was significantly elevated in the STHD-01-fed mice in the 
liver, plasma, and feces (Figure 3B). Depletion of the gut 
microbiota did not alter the accumulation of cholesterol in 
the liver (Figure 3B). Moreover, antibiotic treatment did 
not alter the concentration of total bile acids in the liver

protocol. (B) Body weight, total calorie intake, liver/body weight, and plasma triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxin (T4) levels were measured

and feces, while total the concentration of bile acids in 
plasma was reduced after depletion of the microbiota in 
the early phase of NASH (9 weeks) (Figure 3B). These 
results suggest that STHD-01 causes an accumulation 
of total bile acids, which is not mediated by the gut 
microbiota.
Bile acid reabsorption may be suppressed in 
HFD-fed mice
To address the mechanisms by which bile acids 
accumulate in the liver upon consumption of STHD-01, 
we next examined the effect of STHD-01 on the expression 
of transporters that are related to bile acid extraction and 
reabsorption (Figure 4A). At 9 weeks post STHD-01 
feeding, transcription of bile acid reabsorption transporters 
in the ileum and liver, such as sodium-dependent bile 
acid transporter (Asbt), organic solute transporter (Ost) 
α and organic anion-transporting polypeptide (Oatp)1, 
was significantly suppressed in the STHD-01 group, as 
compared to that in the control group (Figure 4B). The 
transcription levels of these transporters were restored by 
depletion of the gut microbiota (Figure 4B). However, at 
41 weeks post STHD-01 feeding, transcription of these 
transporters decreased even in the STHD-01 + Abx group 
(Figure 4B).

the same group of mice were then pooled and the gut microbiome was analyzed by T-RFLP. The abundance of bacterial genus is shown.

Bile acid composition is altered by the depletion 
of gut microbiota
Figure 3 demonstrates the accumulation of 
cholesterol and total bile acids in the liver upon 
consumption of STHD-01. Accumulation of total bile 
acids was not improved by treatment with antibiotics, 
whereas STHD-01-promoted NASH and HCC were 
significantly suppressed by the depletion of gut 
microbiota. These results suggest a possibility that gut 
microbiota mediate compositional changes in bile acids, 
rather than promoting their synthesis and reabsorption. 
Therefore, we next analyzed the composition of bile acids 
accumulated in the liver and feces. After both 9 weeks and 
41 weeks of STHD-01 feeding, primary bile acids were 
predominant in the liver and the feces (Figure 5A, 5B). At 
9 weeks, β-muricholic acid (βMC) was the predominant 
bile acid in the liver and feces of both control and STHD￾01-fed mice (Figure 5A). Treatment with antibiotics 
decreased the concentration of βMC and increased taurin￾conjugated βMC (TβMC) in the feces, but no changes 
were observed in their levels in the liver (Figure 5A), 
suggesting that bacteria that mediate the deconjugation 
of taurine in the gut were depleted by antibiotics. At 41 
weeks, TβMC became the predominant primary bile acid 
in the liver in all three groups of mice, whereas βMC was 
the predominant primary bile acid in the feces, except 
in the Abx group (Figure 5B). The concentration of 
secondary bile acids was lower than that of primary bile 
acids in feces and almost undetectable in the liver at 9 
weeks (Figure 5A). At 9 weeks, secondary bile acids in 
feces were slightly increased in STHD-01-fed mice than 
in the control mice, and their levels increased further at 
41 weeks (Figure 5A, 5B). Secondary bile acids in feces 
decreased dramatically when the gut microbiota was 
depleted by antibiotics (Figure 5A, 5B), indicating that the 
gut microbiota mediates the conversion of bile acids from 
primary to secondary. 
Gut microbiota regulates the accumulation of 
secondary bile acids in the liver 
Because the generation of secondary bile acids is 
mediated by the microbiota in the gut, we further assessed 
the accumulation of secondary bile acids in the liver of 
mice developing NASH-associated HCC. Figure 6A shows 
the metabolic pathway of cholesterol to bile acids. Red line 
columns indicate primary bile acids and purple columns 
indicate secondary bile acids. Figure 6B demonstrates 
the concentration of secondary bile acids in the liver of 
mice in the STHD-01 and STHD-01 + Abx groups. At 9 
weeks, accumulation of deoxycholic acid (DCA), Tauro￾DCA (TDCA), and Hyo-DCA (HDCA) induced by STHD￾01 was markedly reduced by treatment with antibiotics 
(Figure 6B). The levels of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) 
and Tauro-UDCA (TUDCA) in the liver were not different 
between STHD-01 and STHD-01 + Abx mice (Figure 
6B). 12-Keto litho cholic acid (KLCA) was almost 
undetectable in both groups (Figure 6B). At 41 weeks, 
TDCA, KLCA, UDCA, and TUDCA accumulated in the 
liver, and the accumulation was reversed by depletion of 
the gut microbiota (Figure 6B). DCA and HDCA became 
undetectable in the liver in the later phase of the disease 
(Figure 6B). This result suggests that generation of

synthesis from cholesterol and related enzymes are shown. (B) Total bile acid concentration in plasma, feces, and liver. Liver samples were

7). **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001 by Tukey’s test.

secondary bile acids in the gut and their accumulation in 
the liver were mediated by the gut microbiota. 
Secondary bile acids activate mTOR signaling in 
hepatocytes
Our results indicated that STHD-01 promotes 
the accumulation of secondary bile acids in the liver, 
resulting in the progression of HCC in NASH. To address 
the mechanisms by which accumulated secondary bile 
acids promote the liver carcinogenesis, we stimulated a 
hepatocyte cell line HepG2 by primary bile acids cholic 
acid (CA) and chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) or a 
secondary bile acid DCA. Both primary and secondary 
bile acids did not show any cytotoxicity on HepG2 cells 
(Figure 7A). Next, we examined the activation of the 
mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, which 
is known to be associated with liver carcinogenesis [12].

acid transporters in the liver and ileum were analyzed. The fold expression relative to 9 week control mice are shown. Data are expressed 
as mean ± SD (CONT, n = 5; STHD-01, n = 9; STHD-01 + Abx, n = 7). *

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget 9931 Oncotarget
As shown in Figure 7B, DCA, but not CA and CDCA, 
induced phosphorylation of mTOR in HepG2 cells. 
This result suggests that accumulation of secondary bile 
acids in the liver may promote liver carcinogenesis via 
activation of the mTOR pathway in hepatocytes. Of note, 
DCA could induce mTOR activation in HepG2 cells in a 
lower concentration (0.6 µM), which might be closer to 
the physiological concentration in the liver (Figure 7C). 
 STHD-01 induces mTOR activation in the liver
Lastly, we assessed the activation of the mTOR 
pathway in STHD-01-fed mice. We examined the activation 
of the PI3K- Akt/protein kinase B (Akt) pathway, which is 
known to lead to mTOR activation, and nucleoporin p62 
(p62) and nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like (Nrf) 2, 
which are known targets of mTOR [21] in the liver (Figure 
8). Phosphorylation of mTOR was significantly elevated in 
mice fed the STHD-01 compared to control mice and the 
activation was suppressed by the treatment with antibiotics 
(Figure 8, Supplementary Data 3). Increased activation of 
Akt, p62, or Nrf2 was not observed in STHD-01-fed mice 
(Figure 8). These results suggested that STHD-01 induces 
the activation of mTOR in the liver, probably mediated by 
the metabolites generated by the gut microbiota, such as 
secondary bile acids.

DISCUSSION
The role of the gut microbiota in the pathogenesis 
of liver diseases has been repeatedly proposed in recent 
years. Particularly, the gut microbial metabolites play 
significant roles in the development of NASH and NASH￾associated HCC. Recently, Yoshimoto et al. reported that 
an HFD diet, along with the administration of a chemical 
carcinogen DMBA, results in the development of HCC 
in mice [14]. This phenotype is mediated by the gut

pathways. (B) A heat-map of the abundance of detected secondary bile acids in the liver. Sample from all the mice in the same group were

microbiota, as treatment with antibiotics has been shown 
to suppress the development of HCC [14]. Moreover, 
HFD-induced HCC requires the co-administration of 
chemical substances. However, since the direct effect of 
these chemical substances on lipid accumulation or on the 
composition and/or function of the gut microbiota remains 
uncertain, the use of these chemical carcinogens might 
have potential pitfalls and therefore cannot completely 
represent the natural course of HCC development from 
NASH in humans. In contrast, a newly developed 
HFD, STHD-01, has been reported to promote HCC 
development without co-administration of carcinogenic 
chemicals [19]. Hence, in the present study, we utilized 
this clinically relevant HFD, STHD-01, and analyzed 
the metabolites of gut microbiota in the promotion of 
oncogenic pathways. We found that the gut microbiota 
is required for deconjugation of bile acids, as well as for 
the conversion of primary bile acids to secondary bile

acids in STHD-01-fed animals. Therefore, depletion of 
the gut microbiota by treatment with antibiotics markedly 
reduced the concentration of secondary bile acids in both 
feces and liver. Since secondary bile acids might have 
potential to induce carcinogenic signaling, such as mTOR 
activation, their metabolism by the gut microbiota play 
a key role in the development of HCC in STHD-01-fed 
mice. Notably, secondary bile acids alone are probably not 
enough to induce the development of HCC since they are 
already present at significant concentration in the livers of 
control mice. Since STHD-01 induces pro-inflammatory 
changes, such as the elevated expression of Tnf-α and 
Il-1β and the infiltration of inflammatory macrophages, 
in the liver (Figure 2B and Supplementary Data 1), liver 
inflammation might augments the secondary bile acid￾induced carcinogenesis in the liver.
Gut microbiome analysis revealed that abundance 
of bacterial genera of Bacteroides and Clostridium 
cluster XVIII increased, and that of Streptococcus, 
Bifidobacterium, and Prevotella decreased after feeding 
with STHD-01. Clostridium is known to metabolize the 
primary bile acids and convert them to secondary bile 
acids [14]. Therefore, increased number of these bacteria 
may correlate with increased accumulation of secondary 
bile acids in STHD-01-fed mice. Bacteroides might 
contribute to deconjugation of bile acids, which is also 
required for generation of secondary bile acids [22]. After 
treatment with antibiotics, numbers of these bacteria were 
dramatically decreased in the gut. In parallel, generation of 
secondary bile acids was markedly suppressed in STHD￾01 + Abx mice. Notably, accumulation of cholesterol 
in the liver and total bile acids in the liver, plasma, and 
feces induced by STHD-01-feeding was not changed by 
depletion of the gut microbiota. These phenotypes were 
also seen in mice fed a conventional HFD in a previous 
report [23]. These results indicate that the gut microbiota 
does not affect the absorption of cholesterol, primary bile 
synthesis, and reabsorption of generated bile acids. On 
the contrary, expression of a bile acid synthesis enzyme, 
Cyp7a1, was up-regulated in STHD-01-fed mice, but 
the expression was significantly suppressed by depletion 
of the microbiota. The concentration of other bile acid 
synthesis enzymes, such as Cyp7b1, was not changed in 
Abx-treated mice, as compared to STHD-01-fed mice. 
Thus, we conclude that the synthesis of bile acids was 
not changed in these two groups. It is noteworthy that 
the accumulation of bile acids in the liver was elevated 
in 9 weeks, but decreased in 41 weeks. This indicates that 
the excess bile acids of the liver may have overflowed 
from the damaged liver in the later phase of NASH. 
Another possibility is that the reabsorption of bile acids 
from the ileum is impaired in the later phase of NASH.

This hypothesis is supported by the bile acid transporter 
expression in the ileum and liver (Figure 4B). It remains 
unclear why reabsorption of bile acids is suppressed in 
the later phase of NASH. One possible explanation is a 
feedback regulation mechanism that limits the absorption 
of harmful secondary bile acids. 
The precise mechanisms by which secondary bile 
acids initiate the oncogenic process in the liver remain 
poorly addressed. Activation of the mTOR pathway is 
known to be associated with oncogenesis in various types 
of cancers, such as human cervical and colon cancers 
[24, 25]. However, the involvement of mTOR activation 
in liver cancer remains incompletely understood. It 
has been reported that stimulation of a nuclear receptor 
farnesoid X receptor (FXR) leads to activation of mTOR 
pathways [21]. Since bile acids are known ligands for 
FXR, it is plausible that accumulated bile acids initiate 
the activation of the oncogenic mTOR pathway in the 
liver. In accordance with our hypothesis, DCA, but not 
CA or CDCA, induced activation of mTOR in hepatocytes 
(Figure 7B, 7C). Since mTOR was activated by DCA, but 
not by other potential FXR agonists CA and CDCA, this 
activation might not be mediated through FXR [26, 27] 
(Figure 7B, 7C and Figure 8). Although the present study 
suggests an importance of mTOR pathway activation by 
secondary bile acids in hepatocarcinogenesis, there are 
other possible mechanisms that might be involved in 
the promotion of HCC by accumulated secondary bile 
acids. For example, we found that STHD-01-fed mice 
displayed an increased expression of pro-inflammatory 
cytokines in the liver, and inflammation was reduced upon 
treatment with antibiotics. Since inflammation promotes 
carcinogenesis in different kinds of cancer, including 
HCC and secondary bile acids elicit inflammation in 
hepatocytes [14], accumulated secondary bile acids 
might contribute to enhanced carcinogenesis through the 
facilitation of liver inflammation [28]. Moreover, it is also 
possible that accumulated secondary bile acids activate 
FXR signaling, thereby promoting tumor development. 
This notion is supported by the evidence that TβMC, an 
antagonist of FXR, was elevated in the liver and feces 
of the STHD-01 + Abx group. Increased TβMC might 
prevent FXR activation and subsequent tumorigenesis 
induced by secondary bile acids [29]. In conclusion, mice 
fed a new class high-fat diet STHD-01 develop HCC in 
NASH. HCC development is mediated by metabolites 
produced by the gut microbiota, such as secondary bile 
acids. Secondary bile acids such as DCA might contribute 
to oncogenesis, possibly via the activation of mTOR 
signaling in hepatocytes.

Animals
SPF C57BL/6J mice were fed a conventional CE-2 
diet (CLEA Japan Inc., Tokyo, Japan) until the start of 
the experiments (8 weeks of age). The gut microbiota 
was normalized by mixing beddings between cages every 
2–3 days for 2 weeks. Mice were fed an STHD-01 (11% 
kcal/protein, 72% kcal/fat, and 17% kcal/nitrogen-free 
extracts; EA Pharmaceuticals Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) 
[19] for 9 weeks (short-term experiment) or 41 weeks 
(long-term experiment). The control group was fed an 
SD diet (AIN-93G; 19% kcal/protein, 12% kcal/fat, 
and 69% kcal/nitrogen-free extract). To deplete the gut 
microbiota, a cocktail of Abx (1 g/L ceftazidime and 1 g/L 
metronidazole; both from Sigma-Aldrich, Tokyo, Japan) 
was administered one week before starting STHD-01 
feeding. Mice were euthanized after 9 weeks or 41 weeks, 
and feces, plasma, liver, and small intestinal samples were 
harvested. Tumor count in the liver tissue and histological 
evaluation was performed in a blinded manner by two 
pathologists and a hepatologist from Keio University 
Hospital and biochemical examinations were conducted 
according to a previously described method [30].
Measurement of biomarkers for liver 
inflammation
Levels of T3 and T4 were analyzed using enzyme￾linked immunosorbent assay kits (Alpha Diagnostic 
Intl. Inc., Antonio, TX). Levels of AST and ALT were 
measured using Spotchem EZ (SP-4430, Arkray USA Inc., 
Minneapolis, MN).
Liver cell preparation 
The livers were perfused through the portal vein with 
FACS buffer [1 g bovine serum albumin (BSA) in 500 mL 
PBS] and then minced well. The filtrate was centrifuged 
at 50 g for 1 min, and the supernatant was washed 

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget 9936 Oncotarget
once. The cells were suspended in Histopaque solution 
(Sigma-Aldrich) and overlaid on an HBSS solution to 
distinguish monocytes. After centrifugation at 2000 rpm 
for 20 min, the cells were collected from the upper phase 
of the Histopaque, and were washed and resuspended 
in a RPMI1640 medium. After blocking with anti-FcR 
(CD16/32, BD bioscience, NJ) for 20 min, the cells were 
incubated with specific monoclonal antibodies at 4°C for 
30 min. Liver mononuclear cells were stained with PE￾Cy7-conjugated anti-mouse CD11c mAb and fluorescein 
isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated anti-mouse CD11b 
mAb (both from BD biosciences) were used for analyzing 
plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), conventional 
dendritic cells (cDCs), and macrophages. Background 
fluorescence was assessed by staining with the relevant 
isotype control Abs. Stained cells were analyzed by flow 
cytometry (FACS Cant II, Becton Dickinson Co. Franklin 
Lakes, NJ), and data were analyzed using the FlowJo 
software (FlowJo, LLC, Ashland, OR). 
Quantitative RT-PCR 
RNA samples were purified from the liver and 
small intestinal tissues in accordance with a previously 
described method [31]. The cDNA samples were prepared 
from the purified RNAs using the High Capacity cDNA 
Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster 
city, CA, USA), and quantitative polymerase chain 
reaction (PCR) was performed using the SYBR Green 
PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). Quantification 
was carried out using the CFX96TouchTM (Applied 
Biosystems). The cycling steps were as follows: 50 ºC × 2 
min, 95 ºC × 10 min, (95 ºC × 30 s, 60 ºC × 30 s, 72 ºC × 
1 min) × 50 cycles. The primers used are summarized in 
Supplementary Data 4.
Microbiome analysis
At 40 weeks post STHD-01 feeding, feces were 
obtained from the mice and resuspended in phosphate 
buffered saline (PBS; Wako, Osaka, Japan) (0.1 g/mL). 
The fecal suspension was smashed using the Bug Crasher 
(Taitec GM-01, Saitama, Japan) at maximum rotation for 
10 min. The sample was on ice for 5 min and centrifuged 
at 2,300 × g at 4ºC for 1 min. The DNA pellet was 
extracted using phenol/chloroform/isoamylalcohol (PCI; 
Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, MI). DNA was 
resuspended in 100 µL tris/ethylenediaminetetraacetic 
acid buffer (TE; Sigma) supplemented with 0.5 µL RNase 
A (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The DNA was further 
purified using the Template Preparation Kit (Roche, Basel, 
Switzerland). 
The extracted DNA was measured by terminal 
restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis 
(TechnoSuruga Laboratory Co., Ltd., Shizuoka, Japan). 
The DNA was amplified using fluorescence-labeled 
primers. The amplified DNA was supplemented with the 
restriction enzyme BS/I (Takara Bio Inc., Tokyo, Japan) 
and analyzed using the ABI Prism 3130xl DNA Sequencer 
(Applied Biosystems) and Gene Mapper (Applied 
Biosystems). Cluster analysis was demonstrated using 
the GeneMaths program (Applied Maths, Sint-Martens￾Latem, Belgium). 
To measure the total number of gut bacteria 
in the feces, a standard curve was generated using 
genomic DNA from Escherichia coli JCM1649T. 
The sample DNA was amplified with primers 8F (5′ 
AGAGTTTGATYMTGGCTCAG 3′) and 1510R (5′ 
TACGGYTACCTTGTTACGACTT 3′). Quantitative 
PCR (qPCR) was performed using the SYBR Green PCR 
Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) and the CFX96TouchTM 
(Applied Biosystems). The cycle step was 50 ºC × 2 min, 
95 ºC × 10 min, (95 ºC × 30 s, 60 ºC × 30 s, 72 ºC × 1 min) 
× 50 cycles.
Bile acid extraction from liver and feces 
Dried feces (10 mg) were dissolved in 0.2 mL 90% 
ethanol and incubated at 65 ºC for 1 h. The samples were 
then dissolved in 0.5 mL 90% ethanol. The total levels 
of bile acids in the plasma and feces were measured with 
the TBA-Test (Wako). Each liver tissue sample (0.1 g) 
was treated with Folch solution and homogenized. Total 
levels of cholesterol were measured by the T-cho E-Test 
(Wako). Extracted lipids were quantitatively analyzed. 
As a recovery standard, norcholic acid (Steraloids, Inc., 
Newport, RI; 1 mg/mL stock solution in 50% ethanol) was 
added to the ethanol. Filtrated extracts were centrifuged at 
12,000 × g for 5 min and diluted 10 times in water. The 
diluted extracts were then analyzed using high-pressure 
liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (50 mm 
× 1 mm C8 column, buffered mobile phase) [32]. 
HepG2 cell culture 
The HepG2 cell line was obtained from the 
American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). 
HepG2 cells were cultured as described previously [33]. 
HepG2 cells were treated with 0.6 µM or 60 µM of CA, 
CDCA and DCA (Sigma-Aldrich) dissolved in 0.125% 
dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO). After 24 h of stimulation, 
cells were harvested, and proteins were extracted using 
RIPA Buffer (Wako) supplemented with a protease 
inhibitor (Roche).
Western blotting 
Frozen liver tissue samples were homogenized 
in the T-PER solution (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.), 
supplemented with protease inhibitors (Roche), using a 
BioMasher (Nippi, Tokyo, Japan). Protein concentration 
was measured using the BCA™ Protein Assay Kit 

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget 9937 Oncotarget
(Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.). The homogenized tissue 
samples were mixed with equal parts of Laemmli Sample 
Buffer (Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc., Tokyo, Japan) and 
resolved by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel 
electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE; Mini-Protein® TGM™ 7.5%; 
molecular marker, MagicMark™ XP Western Protein 
Standard; Invitrogen, Waltham MA). Electrophoresis was 
performed at 200 V for 50 min. The resolved proteins 
were then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (GE 
Healthcare Bioscience, Tokyo, Japan) with TE 70 semi￾dry transfer unit (GE Healthcare Bioscience) at 45 mA for 
90 min. After the transfer, the membranes were blocked 
with a blocking buffer (PBS, 0.02% Tween, and 20.5% 
skim milk) at 4 ºC overnight. Antibodies specific for p62 
(1:500, ABNOVA Products, Waltham, MI), Nrf2 (1:1000, 
Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), mTOR 
(1:200, CST, Danvers, MA), p-mTOR (1:250, CST), 
Akt (1:200, CST), and p-Akt (1:300, CST) were used as 
primary antibodies, and a horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-
conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1:5000 goat anti￾rabbit IgG (H+L); Invitrogen) was used as the secondary 
antibody. As a control, β-actin-HRP mouse monoclonal 
IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.) was used. The 
membrane was reacted with ECL Western Blotting 
Detection Reagent (GE Healthcare Bioscience), and 
protein bands were visualized using an ECL mini-camera 
(GE Healthcare Bioscience). The density of bands was 
measured using ImageJ software. 
Immunohistochemistry 
We tried to choose the paraffin-embedded tissue 
blocks containing tumoral and preferably adjacent normal 
liver tissue. About 5 µm. thick tissue sections were cut 
after that deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated it 
through graded alcohols.
Then slides were rinsed with the water and immersed 
in TE buffer (Kanto Chemical Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) 
at pH 8.0 in the autoclaving for antigen retrieval for 40 
minutes. After washing the slides in Super Sensitive Wash 
Buffer (BioGenex Laboratories Inc., San Ramon, CA), we 
used Peroxidase Block reagent with 3% H2
O2
 (WAKO) to 
neutralize endogenous peroxidase for at-least 5 minutes. The 
slides were incubated with antibodies specific for p-mTOR 
(1:50, CST) at 4 ºC overnight. After overnight the slides 
were washed again in Super Sensitive Wash Buffer. We 
incubated the slides with HistostarTM (Medical & Biological 
Laboratories Co., Ltd., Nagoya, Japan) for 30 minutes. 
Once again, washing in Super Sensitive Wash Buffer with 
gentle rocking followed with developing peroxidase activity 
with DAB working solution (BioGenex Laboratories Inc.) 
for 1 minutes. Then we washed the slides in water and 
counterstained them with Hematoxylin (Muto Pure Chemical 
Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). After rewashing the slides in water, 
we finally dehydrated, cleared and mounted sections. Our 
slides were ready at the time for microscopic observation.
Statistical analyses 
Results were plotted as mean ± standard deviation. 
A one-way ANOVA followed by the Tukey’s post-hoc test 
was used to compare differences between multiple groups. 
Student’s t-test or Mann-Whitney U-test was used to 
compare differences between two groups. All comparisons 
were two-sided, and a p-value < 0.05 was considered 
significant. All statistical analyses were performed using 
the SPSS 22 for Windows (SPSS, IBM Japan, Tokyo, 
Japan).
