Abstract
Background: Laryngopharyngeal sensitivity (LPS) is important in
preventing pulmonary aspiration and may be impaired by
anaesthesia and stroke. It has been suggested that gastro-
oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) may also impair LPS, although
the underlying mechanism is unclear. The aim of this study was to
compare LPS in patients with chronic cough and GORD with
healthy subjects and to determine the effect of laryngopharyngeal
infusions of both acid and normal saline on LPS.
Methods: Fifteen patients with chronic cough and GORD and 10
healthy subjects without GORD underwent LPS testing using the
fibreoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing with sensory testing
(FEESST) technique. LPS, as measured by the lowest air pressure
required to elicit the laryngeal adductor reflex (LAR), was
determined both before and after laryngopharyngeal infusions of
normal saline and 0.1 N hydrochloric acid performed on separate
days.
Results: The mean baseline LAR threshold of the patient group was
significantly higher (9.5 mm Hg, range 6.0–10.0) than in normal
subjects (3.68 mm Hg, range 2.5–5.0; p<0.01). Retest thresholds
were not significantly different. In normal subjects LAR thresholds
were significantly raised after acid but not after saline infusion (p = 
0.005). There were no complications associated with the procedure.
Conclusions: Patients with cough and GORD have significantly
reduced LPS to air stimuli compared with healthy subjects which
could potentially result in an increased risk of aspiration. Exposure
to small amounts of acid significantly impaired the sensory integrity
of the laryngopharynx.
