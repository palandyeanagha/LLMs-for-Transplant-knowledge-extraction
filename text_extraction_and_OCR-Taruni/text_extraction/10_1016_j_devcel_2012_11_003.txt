SUMMARY
Fenestral and stomatal diaphragms are endothelial subcellular structures of unknown function that
form on organelles implicated in vascular permeability: fenestrae, transendothelial channels and
caveolae. PV1 protein is required for diaphragm formation in vitro. Here, we report that deletion
of the PV1-encoding Plvap gene in mice results in the absence of diaphragms and decreased
survival. Loss of diaphragms did not affect the fenestrae and transendothelial channels formation
but disrupted the barrier function of fenestrated capillaries causing a major leak of plasma
proteins. This disruption results in early death of animals due to severe non-inflammatory protein
loosing enteropathy. Deletion of PV1 in endothelium, but not the hematopoietic compartment,
recapitulates the phenotype of global PV1 deletion, whereas endothelial reconstitution of PV1
rescues the phenotype. Taken together, these data provide genetic evidence for the critical role of
the diaphragms in fenestrated capillaries in the maintenance of blood composition.

INTRODUCTION
Microvascular permeability is a vital function by which endothelial cells (ECs) in
combination with their glycocalyx and basement membranes from capillaries and
postcapillary venules (the so-called exchange segment of the vascular tree), control the
exchange of molecules between the blood plasma and the interstitial fluid, while maintaining
blood and tissue homeostasis (Bates, 2010; Dvorak, 2010; Komarova and Malik, 2010;
Levick and Michel, 2010). A clear understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in
the control of microvascular permeability continues to elude us, fueling persisting
controversy as to which pathways are employed by different molecules in order to cross the
endothelial barrier (Predescu et al., 2007; Rippe et al., 2002). To cross the EC monolayer
proper, molecules use either a paracellular (i.e. in between the cells) or a transcellular (i.e.
across the cells) route. Transcellular exchange is accomplished via either solute transporters,
or transcytosis via vesicular carriers (e.g. caveolae), or pore-like subcellular structures (i.e.
fenestrae and transendothelial channels (TECs)) [reviewed in (Aird, 2007; Tse and Stan,
2010).
A large part of the problem is the lack of understanding of the function of the different
endothelial subcellular structures involved in permeability, adopted by ECs in the exchange
segment of different vascular beds (Aird, 2007; Tse and Stan, 2010). Among these structures
are caveolae, fenestrae and TECs. Fenestrae are 60–80nm diameter transcellular pores
spanned by fenestral diaphragms (FDs), except in the ECs of kidney glomerulus and the
liver sinusoids (Clementi and Palade, 1969a; Reeves et al., 1980; Wisse, 1970). FDs consist
of radial fibrils (Bearer and Orci, 1985) and display tufts of heparan sulfate proteoglycans on
their luminal side (Simionescu et al., 1981). TECs thought to be fenestrae precursors, occur
interspersed with fenestrae in attenuated areas of the ECs albeit at approximately 5–20 fold
lower surface density, depending on the vascular bed (Milici et al., 1985). TECs are spanned
by two diaphragms without heparan sulfate proteoglycan tufts (Rostgaard and Qvortrup,
1997). Caveolae are plasma membrane invaginations, which in ECs of select vascular beds
(i.e. lung and all fenestrated ECs) display a thin protein barrier-like structure in their necks
called a stomatal diaphragm (SD) (Stan et al., 1999a).
FDs occur at sites where molecules are adsorbed from the interstitium into the blood stream
(i.e. endocrine glands, kidney peritubular capillaries and intestine villi). Tracer experiments
(Clementi and Palade, 1969a) as well as whole organ studies (Levick and Smaje, 1987) have
suggested that FDs and the “glycocalyx tufts” present on their luminal side, form a
combined filter acting as a permselective barrier allowing the passage of water and small
molecules (i.e. ions, sugars, amino acids, small peptide hormones) and blocking the
extravasation of macromolecules [reviewed in (Levick and Michel, 2010)]. While
information exists on the molecular diameter cut-off of the basement membrane, opinions
vary as to the contribution of proteoglycans and diaphragm to the filter (Bearer and Orci,
1985; Levick and Smaje, 1987). Tracer studies also hint to a barrier function for SDs in
caveolae (Clementi and Palade, 1969a; Villaschi et al., 1986) but the physiological
implications are still unclear. There is little knowledge on the precise function of TECs.
The removal of a long-standing obstacle in studying the function of endothelial diaphragms
was initiated by proteomic studies identifying a homodimeric endothelial membrane
glycoprotein, namely PV1, as the first known molecular component of both FDs and SDs
(Stan, 2004; Stan et al., 1999a; Stan et al., 1999b; Stan et al., 1997). PV1 is necessary to
form FDs and SDs in cells in culture (Ioannidou et al., 2006; Stan et al., 2004). Moreover,
formation of FDs and SDs appears to be the sole cellular function of PV1 in ECs
(Tkachenko et al., 2012). Recently, the deletion of PV1 in mice was reported confirming the
role of PV1 in forming both FDs and SDs in vivo (Herrnberger et al., 2012a; Herrnberger et
Stan et al. Page 2

al., 2012b). A model by which the FDs and SDs are similar structures consisting of a
framework of radial fibrils made of PV1 homodimers was proposed (Tse and Stan, 2010).
However, this model is not a matter of general consensus, other studies disputing the role of
PV1 in diaphragm formation (Hnasko and Ben-Jonathan, 2005; Hnasko et al., 2006a).
With the exception of two reports (Hnasko et al., 2006b; Hnasko et al., 2002), most data
agree on PV1 being an endothelial specific protein [reviewed in (Tse and Stan, 2010)]. This
is also supported by PV1 being the antigen of two classic “anti-endothelial” monoclonal
antibodies MECA-32 (Hallmann et al., 1995) and PAL-E (Niemela et al., 2005) and studies
of LacZ knock-in in Plvap locus in mice (Herrnberger et al., 2012a; Herrnberger et al.,
2012b). PV1 has emerging roles in cancer (Carson-Walter et al., 2005; Deharvengt et al.,
2012; Madden et al., 2004), diapedesis of leukocytes in sites of inflammation (Keuschnigg
et al., 2009), inflammatory (Mozer et al., 2010) and ocular disease (Chen et al., 2012; Paes
et al., 2011; Schafer et al., 2009).
Herein, we exploit the obligate role of PV1 in diaphragm formation to examine in vivo the
role of FDs in the maintenance of permselectivity in fenestrated endothelia and thereby in
blood plasma composition. Using independently generated mice with loss and gain of PV1
function, we also confirm that endothelial PV1 is required for diaphragm formation in vivo,
and that the diaphragms in organs with fenestrated vessels are essential for maintaining
endothelial barrier function, basal permeability and blood composition. Impairment of FD
function in PV1 deficient mice leads to selective loss of plasma proteins with consequent
edema and dyslipidemia, gradually resulting in multiple organ dysfunction. PV1 deficient
mice succumb to a lethal, non-inflammatory, protein loosing enteropathy. Thus, PV1
mediated endothelial barrier function is critical for mammalian survival.
RESULTS
PV1 is essential for intrauterine and postnatal survival
To determine the function of PV1 protein and endothelial diaphragms in vivo, mice were
generated that carried LoxP sites inserted into introns 1 and 5 of the mouse PV1/Plvap locus
(PV1
L/L mice)(Fig. 1A, S1A). By breeding the PV1
L/L mice with CMV-cre mice, which
express the cre recombinase under the control of the ubiquitously activated
cytomegalovirus-derived promoter (CMV), we generated PV1
−/− mice, lacking PV1 in all
tissues (Fig. 1A, S1B–C). PV1 absence following disruption of the PV1/Plvap gene was
confirmed at mRNA (Fig. 1B) and protein level (Fig. 1C).
Homozygous disruption of the PV1/Plvap gene led to sharply decreased survival that varied
depending on the mouse strain used. On pure C57Bl/6J background, PV1 deletion resulted
in 100% lethality between embryonic day E13 (embryonic day 13) and P2 (postnatal day 2).
On hybrid intercrosses containing a mix of Balb/c (50%), C57Bl/6J (37.5%) and 129Sv/J
(12.5%) backgrounds, ~20% of the expected frequency of homozygous PV1
−/− mice
survived up to 3–4 months of age (Fig. 1D–E). The heterozygote PV1
+/− had decreased PV1
mRNA (Fig. 1B) and protein levels (Fig. 5B), but did not exhibit any obvious phenotype on
either C57BL/6J or mixed backgrounds. All the subsequent experiments in PV1
−/− mice
were carried out on mixed Balb/c - C57Bl/6J - 129Sv/J background because it was the only
one that allowed the study of postnatal PV1
−/− phenotype.
At birth, PV1
−/− mice displayed normal appearance and normal size but gradually developed
signs of growth retardation and wasting. Decreased average body weight was significant in
both genders by P4 progressing in severity as the mice aged (Fig. S1D). At 4 week-old
PV1
−/− mice had ~30–40% reduction in body weight (Fig. S1D) and ~15% in body length
(Fig. S1E–F). The small body size was accompanied by a generalized decrease in white

adipose tissue deposits in the abdominal wall, retroperitoneal and gonadal fat pads as shown
by MRI in 3–4 week-old live PV1−/− mice (Fig. S1G) and a reduced gonadal fat pad/body
weight ratio postmortem (Fig. S1H). By that age PV1
−/− mice also developed a distended
abdomen due to accumulation of ascites (not shown). Aside from an abnormally bent tail
observed in ~70% of mutant mice (Fig. S1E), no defect in organ appearance and size (as
determined by organ/body weight ratio, data not shown) were observed at birth in PV1
−/−
mice. Past 1 week of age, PV1−/− pancreata displayed an abnormally reduced size as
evidenced by pancreas/body weight ratio (Fig. S1I). All organs, including the pancreas had
normal histological appearance (Fig. S2A).
PV1 is essential for the formation of endothelial diaphragms in situ
In vitro studies have shown that PV1 is required for diaphragm formation (Ioannidou et al.,
2006; Stan et al., 2004) suggesting that PV1 loss in vivo would prevent diaphragm
formation in fenestrae, TECs and caveolae. To confirm this critical finding, we conducted
morphometric analyses in adult PV1
−/− mice of mixed background using both transmission
and scanning electron microscopy. Diaphragm presence was determined by a combination
of ultrathin sectioning (20–40nm), specimen tilting and morphometry. We examined 1)
organs with fenestrated capillaries where caveolae, TEC and fenestrae exhibit diaphragms
(i.e. adrenals, choroid plexus, kidney, pituitary, thyroid, intestinal villi, salivary glands and
pancreas), 2) the continuous endothelium of lung capillaries that exhibits only caveolae with
SDs, and 3) the two organs with fenestrated endothelia where PV-1 and diaphragms are
normally absent (kidney glomerular and liver sinusoidal capillaries).
Caveolae diaphragms were also absent in PV1−/− capillaries from lung (Fig. 1G), adrenals
(Fig. 1H), pancreas (Fig. 1I), pituitary, thyroid, kidney, intestinal villi, and liver (not shown),
as compared to WT exemplified for the lung (Fig. 1F). In lungs, the surface density of EC
caveolae (not shown) and the protein levels of its structural component caveolin 1 (Fig. 1C)
were unchanged in PV1
−/− mice by comparison to WT and PV1+/− mice (not shown). The
levels of VE Cadherin were also similar (Fig. 1C) suggesting a similar number of vessels.
In control mice, diaphragms were observed in fenestrae and TECs of all fenestrated
capillaries examined, as exemplified by kidney peritubular capillaries (Fig. 1J). Such
diaphragms were absent in the corresponding PV1−/− capillaries (Table 1). Instead, only
open conduits/pores in the size range of fenestrae and TECs (~50–120 nm), lacking any
electron opaque structure indicative of the diaphragms, were found. Figure 1 illustrates the
findings in PV1
−/− capillaries from adrenals (Fig. 1H), pancreas (Fig. 1I), intestine (Fig.
S2Ba), choroid plexus (Fig. S2Bb), pituitary (Fig. S2Bc), thyroid (Fig. S2Bd), and kidney
peritubular capillaries (Fig. 1J,K and S2Be). Without diaphragms, it was not possible to
reliably discriminate if these pores were fenestrae or TECs. However, the PV1−/− pore
surface density (3.87 +/−0.54 stdev) was comparable to the aggregated fenestrae/TEC
density in wild type (WT)(4.11 +/− 0.36 stdev) peritubular capillaries of kidney (Fig. 1L).
Of minor note, fenestral pores in PV1
−/− mice exhibited a larger variation of diameter (Fig.
1L, right panel).
In kidney glomerular and liver sinusoidal capillaries, mature fenestrae without FDs are
developmentally preceded by PV1-positive fenestrae with FDs (Bankston and Pino, 1980;
Ichimura et al., 2008; Wisse, 1970). As demonstrated by the normal fenestrae morphology in
sinusoidal (Fig. 1M,N) and glomerular (Fig. 1O–Q) ECs in PV1
−/− mice when compared to
WT, PV1 is not involved, even transiently, in the formation of mature fenestrae in these
vascular segments.
In conclusion, PV1 is necessary for the in vivo formation of diaphragms but is not required
for the formation of caveolae or of fenestrae/TEC pores.

Endothelial specific loss of PV1 phenocopies PV1 germline deletion
To define PV1 functions in ECs and evaluate potential roles in non-endothelial cell types,
we generated PV1 cell-type specific knockout mice and compared them to PV1
−/− animals.
PV1
L/L mice were bred withTie2-cre and VEC-cre transgenic mouse lines, generating
PV1
ECKO-Tie2
 and PV1
ECKO-VEC mice, respectively (Fig. 2A, Table 2), that target both
endothelial and hematopoietic cell compartments during embryogenesis. To discriminate
between the impacts of PV1 absence in the endothelial compartment versus hematopoietic
compartment, PV1
L/L mice were also crossed with Vav1-cre mice (Stadtfeld and Graf,
2005), which express cre exclusively in the hematopoietic compartment (PV1
HCKO-Vav
)
(Fig. 2A, Table 2).
PV1
ECKO-Tie2
 and PV1
ECKO-VEC exhibited a PV1 deletion efficiency >95% (Fig. S2A) and
~70–90% (not shown), respectively, consistent with previous reports (Chen et al., 2009).
PV1
HCKO-Vav
 mice exhibited ~100% deletion in the hematopoietic cells in blood, skin (tail),
peritoneal lavage and spleen (Fig. S2B). Deletion in the tail (Fig. S2B) was negligible,
consistent with the hematopoietic lineage specific activity of the Vav1 promoter. At the
protein level, PV1 levels were drastically reduced in the lungs of PV1
ECKO-Tie2
 (Fig. 2B)
and PV1
ECKO-VEC (not shown) mice, while normal in PV1
HCKO-Vav
 (Fig. 2C), as compared
to littermate controls.
The deletion of PV1/Pvlap in endothelial and hematopoietic cells lineages in both
PV1
ECKO-Tie2
 and PV1
ECKO-VEC mice fully phenocopied PV1
−/− mice with respect to
survival: on pure C57Bl/6J background there were no survivors after P2, while on hybrid
C57Bl/6J;129Sv/J (87.5%;12.5%) backgrounds, ~20–30% of the expected frequency of each
mouse line survived to 3–4 (PV1
ECKO-Tie2
) or 6–7 (PV1
ECKO-VEC) months (Fig. 2D–E,
Table 2). In contrast, no mortality was observed in PV1
HCKO-Vav
 mice (Fig. 2D–E). As
observed in PV1
−/− mice, PV1
ECKO-VEC and PV1
ECKO-Tie2
 but not PV1
HCKO-Vav
 mice
displayed growth retardation (Fig. S2C) with normal organ morphology and histology,
reduced pancreas size and white fat tissue deposits and ascites formation (not shown).
As observed in PV1
−/− mice, both PV1
ECKO-Tie2
 and PV1
ECKO-VEC mice lacked
diaphragms in endothelial fenestrae, TECs and caveolae in pancreas (Fig. 2Fa,i), intestine
(Fig. 2Fb), kidney (Fig. 2Fc,e–g), lung (Fig. 2Fd) and adrenals (Fig. 2Fh,j) whereas,
diaphragms were not affected in the PV1
HCKO-Vav
 mice (Fig. 2Fl). These data were
confirmed by formal morphometric analysis that was carried out only in kidneys and lungs
of PV1
ECKO-Tie2
 mice (Table 1). PV1
ECKO-Tie2
 liver fenestrae morphology (Fig. 2Fk) was
indistinguishable from WT (Fig. 1M).
Therefore, PV1 expression in the endothelium but not hematopoietic cells is essential for
mouse survival and the cellular and gross phenotype observed in PV1
−/− mice stems from
loss of PV1 in ECs.
Loss of endothelial PV1 and diaphragms results in disrupted blood composition
The absence of diaphragms should result in leakage of all plasma components with
molecular diameters between 6–30nm, representing the interval between the upper pore
sizes determined for fenestrated capillaries and their basement membranes respectively
(Sarin, 2010). This would encompass all plasma proteins except those that occur in
extremely large complexes or lipoprotein particles. Conversely, plasma electrolytes should
be relatively unaffected.
Indeed PV1
−/− mice, versus control littermates, showed a sharp decrease in total plasma
protein, albumin and albumin/globulin ratio (Fig. 3A–C) associated with minimal electrolyte
imbalance featuring a lower calcium concentration (TableS1). Hypoproteinemia developed

progressively postnatally with plasma protein levels of PV1
−/− mice, compared to control
WT and PV1
+/− littermates, minimally lower at birth (not shown), 30–40% reduced after
one week, 50–70% reduced after 4 weeks, and continuing to fall with age (Fig. 3A–C). The
altered plasma composition was clearly due to PV1 loss in ECs, as both PV1
ECKO-Tie2
 (Fig.
3D) and PV1
ECKO-VEC (not shown) mice exhibited similar levels of hypoproteinemia,
whereas PV1
HCKO-Vav
 mice showed no changes in plasma protein levels (not shown).
SDS-protein acrylamide gel electrophoresis of plasma showed that hypoproteinemia in
PV1
−/− and PV1
ECKO-Tie2
 mice affected most classes of serum proteins except for proteins
larger than 200kD, which did not decrease with age (Fig. 3E). Similarly, serum protein
agarose gel electrophoresis showed that plasma from PV1
−/−, PV1
ECKO-Tie2
, and
PV1
ECKO-VEC mice had relative decreases in albumin and β globulin fractions, and a large
relative increase in the α globulin fractions (Fig. 3F), also demonstrated by densitometry
(Fig. S3A). The α globulin fractions include some of the largest circulating proteins such as
α2 macroglobulin (950kD), haptoglobin, pentameric IgM (900kD), ceruloplasmin (135kD)
and ApoB apolipoproteins (250kD and 500kD), also suggesting that mostly lower molecular
weight proteins contribute to hypoproteinemia. A prominent loss of smaller proteins was
clearly demonstrated by analysis of protein composition of the ascites fluid formed in both
PV1
−/− and PV1
ECKO mice, which contained albumin and β globulins at the same level with
blood plasma but had sharply diminished α fractions (Fig. 3F). Combined, these data
suggest that PV1 endothelial deficiency leads to “sieving hypoproteinemia”, characteristic of
hypoproteinemia due to protein loss (i.e. protein losing enteropathy or nephropathy), in
which “smaller” plasma proteins preferentially disappear from the plasma.
Major blood plasma proteins are produced in the liver, except for the immunoglobulins (Ig),
which are produced by immune cells. Absolute plasma levels of IgA (Fig. 3G), IgM (Fig.
3H) and IgG (not shown) were reduced in 4 week-old PV1
−/− as compared to WT and
PV1
+/− littermates. Thus, hypoproteinemia affected levels of proteins produced both in the
liver and the immune system.
Other possible causes of hypoproteinemia include decreased production (i.e. due to liver
dysfunction, malnutrition or amino acid malabsorption), increased catabolism or protein loss
(due to protein losing enteropathy or nephropathy). The Ig reduction was not due to an
intrinsic defect in plasma cells, as isolated PV1−/− plasma cells were perfectly able to
produce Ig in vitro, as determined by ELISPOT (not shown). To determine whether liver
function was impaired, we carried out liver function tests of plasma (e.g. plasma liver
enzymes, bilirubin, IgA). PV1
−/− and PV1
ECKO mice and their control littermates exhibited
similar liver enzymes (AST, ALT, ALP; when standardized to total protein), bilirubin (both
direct and indirect) levels (TableS1) and low IgA levels (Fig. 3G). Liver production of
mRNAs for major plasma proteins (albumin, transferrin, fibrinogen) was found to be higher
in PV1
−/− mice (Fig. S3B). These results argue against impaired liver function in PV1
−/−
mice. We were also able to exclude food intake and malabsorption due to pancreatic
dysfunction as causes of hypoproteinemia (R.V. Stan unpublished data).
Although the observed sieving effect in plasma protein composition suggested the
possibility of a nephropathy, PV1
−/− and PV1ECKO mice at different ages exhibited normal
kidney histology (Fig. S2A and S3D) and unaltered glomerular ultrastructure (Fig. 1O,Q).
No protein was found in the urine of PV1
−/− mice between birth and 12 weeks of age. Blood
urea nitrogen (Fig. S3C) and creatinine levels (TableS1), as well as urinalysis tests on
random or 24h urine were also normal. Thus, endothelial loss of PV1 does not impair kidney
function and does not enhance protein catabolism.

Based on published literature, the gradual decrease in plasma protein should be followed by
a certain degree of hypertriglyceridemia due to decreased lipoprotein lipase activity in
peripheral tissues and decreased consumption of dietary triglyceride-rich lipoprotein
particles such as chylomicron remnants (Shearer and Kaysen, 2006; Yoshino et al., 1993).
Moreover, because the particle size of >200nm is much larger than fenestrae/TEC pores,
chylomicron apolipoproteins such as ApoB48 should be spared from plasma protein loss
exhibited by PV1
−/− mice, further demonstrating the sieving. Consistent with these
predictions, plasma lipids were normal in postnatal PV1
−/− mice up to 2 weeks of age (not
shown) - a period of time during which hypoproteinemia first developed. Past 2 weeks,
PV1−/− plasma showed marked lipid accumulation as shown by its milky aspect (Fig. 3I)
and by electron microscopy (Fig. 3J). The severity of lipid accumulation gradually increased
with age, initially confined to the plasma by 4 weeks of age (Fig. 3J, left), accompanied by
xanthoma (lipid-containing white deposits) on the surface of the heart and liver after 8
weeks (Fig. S3E) and later (10–12 weeks) perivascular lipid deposits were formed (Fig. 3J,
right); post 8 weeks in several tissues lipids were seen engorging the capillaries (Fig. 3J,
middle; S3F).
Consistent with these observations, direct lipid measurements in lithium heparin plasma or
in serum from PV1
−/− and control littermates at 4 weeks of age showed severe (10–30 fold)
increase in plasma triglycerides (TG) (1500–2000mg/dL) and moderately increased total
cholesterol (CHOL) (175–250mg/dL) with significantly decreased HDL cholesterol fraction
(HDLc) (20–60mg/dL) in PV1
−/− mice (TableS1). Plasma TG levels further increased 30–
100 fold (up to 5000–6000mg/dL) from 4 to 8 week-old (Fig. 3K–L) both in PV1
−/− and
PV1
ECKO mice followed by a slower gradual increase until death at 12–14 weeks (not
shown). In contrast, the elevated total CHOL and reduced HDLc fractions detected in
PV1
−/− and PV1
ECKO plasma did not vary considerably with time (Fig. 3K–L). Only
extended (24 hours) fasting led to a slow plasma TG level decrease to around 300mg/dL
(Fig. 3M), suggesting that slow TG hydrolysis from the lipoprotein particles is one of the
probable causes of hypertriglyceridemia. Fasting did not affect CHOL or HDLc levels (Fig.
3M). PV1
HCKO and PV1+/− mice had normal lipid levels (Fig. 3I, TableS1).
TGs normally occur in chylomicrons, chylomicrons remnants (CMR) and very low-density
lipoproteins (VLDL). PV1
−/− mice exhibited a dramatic increase in CMR/VLDL as revealed
by TEM analysis of the lumen of blood vessels (Fig. 3I) and by gel filtration FPLC of
plasma samples, showing that CMRs/VLDLs contained the bulk of TG and CHOL (Fig.
3N). This identification was further supported by increased ApoB apolipoproteins in the
plasma and FPLC fractions (Fig. 3N,P). There was a dramatic increase of ApoB48
lipoprotein over the ApoB100 (Fig. 3O,P) suggesting a dietary/intestinal origin for these
particles. The intestine is able to produce chylomicrons (Fig. S3F). Liver overproduction of
VLDL seemed unlikely, based on ApoB and fatty acid synthase mRNA levels being normal
(Fig. S3G).
Combined these data demonstrate that diaphragm deletion leads to sieving hypoproteinemia,
hypertriglyceridemia and increased plasma concentration of chylomicron remnants.
Lack of endothelial PV1 compromises endothelial barrier function to proteins in
fenestrated vessels
At 3–4 weeks, PV1
−/− organs provided with fenestrated vessels (e.g. intestine, kidney and
pancreas) showed signs of edema, while heart, liver, brain and spleen did not show
significant changes (Fig. 4A), as assessed by wet/dry organ weight ratio. Histologically,
intestinal villi were distended with protein-containing material accumulating between the
enterocytes and stroma (Fig. 4B). ECs did not surround this material, which persisted even
after 24h starvation and did not stain with lipid probes such as Oil RedO (not shown), ruling

$watermark-text $watermark-text $watermark-text

out the possibility that these spaces were lipid-containing distended lymphatics/lacteals. The
absence of an inflammatory infiltrate in the intestine (Fig. 4B) and any other organs (Fig.
S2A) showed that edema was not a consequence of inflammation. Altogether, these results
strongly suggest that the absence of diaphragms in PV1
−/− mice produces a leaky fenestrated
endothelium.
Plasma proteins leakage into the interstitial space was also examined using the Evans Blue
(EB) dye extravasation assay (Bates, 2010). EB binds tightly to plasma proteins (especially
albumin) and is normally retained in the vascular space, its extravasation demonstrating
protein leakage into the interstitial space. PV1
−/− mice being severely hypoproteinemic, EB
was pre-bound to purified mouse serum albumin before administration and tissues were
harvested after 5 and 15 minutes, when there is very little EB-albumin extravasation in WT
organs. EB-albumin extravasation was dramatically increased at 15min in PV1
−/− and
PV1
ECKO organs with fenestrated ECs (e.g. intestine, pancreas and kidney), in 4 (Fig. 4C),
and 8 (Fig. 4D) week old mice. Consistent with histological findings, the intestine displayed
the highest rate of EB leakage out of its capillaries (Fig. 4C–E). Minimal increase in EB
extravasation was observed in the PV1
−/− lungs (continuous endothelium expressing PV1
and SDs)(Fig. 4C, right) or heart (continuous endothelium lacking PV1/diaphragms) (Fig.
4C–D) but no change was detected in the liver (fenestrated endothelium without FDs but
expressing PV1 in SDs) (Fig. 4C–D).
EB-albumin extravasation was detected in the ascites in 4 week old PV1
−/− mice (Fig. 4F).
Moreover, EB-albumin was also detected in the lumen of PV1
−/− small intestine (Fig. 4F),
clearly demonstrating protein loss through the intestinal mucosa. Similar results were
observed in PV1
ECKO-Tie2
 mice (not shown).
Next, we used fluorescent tracers of various sizes to evaluate the upper pore size (i.e. the
diameter of the molecules that do not gain passage across the endothelium) of the
fenestrated capillaries in absence of diaphragms. Fluorescent mouse albumin (average
molecular radius of 3.6nm), IgG2(5.5nm), IgM(12nm), and dextrans of 10KD (~2.3nm) and
70KD (5.77nm) average molecular weight were readily detected in the ascites at 5 and 15
min post administration, whereas dextran with an average size of 2×106D (~27.9nm) leaked
much slower (Fig. 4G). To corroborate these findings at EM level we introduced in the
circulation of PV1
−/− mice albumin coated gold nanoparticles of 10, 15 and 25nm and the
site of leakage determined at 5min of tracer perfusion. We found that, in PV1
−/− mice,
albumin-gold particles of all these sizes are able to exit adrenal capillaries, and the gold
particles were clearly associated with diaphragm-less fenestrae/TEC (Fig. 4Ha–e). These
data show an increased pore size for PV1
−/− fenestrated capillaries and identify fenestrae as
sites of leakage.
Combined, these data demonstrate that endothelial PV1 is required for maintenance of basal
permeability in the adult mouse, particularly in vascular beds with fenestrated capillaries
provided with FDs.
Endothelial reconstitution of PV1 rescues the PV1−/− phenotype and restores the
diaphragms of fenestrae and caveolae
To demonstrate that the PV1
−/− phenotype is not due to perturbation of other genes near the
PV1/Pvlap locus, we performed transgenic complementation in which PV1 was
reconstituted specifically in ECs of PV1
−/− mice.
Having previously shown that a HA-tagged PV1 protein behaves as its native counterpart in
cultured cells (Stan et al., 2004), we generated mouse lines (VEC-PV1HA) expressing PV1-
HA under the control of the VE Cadherin promoter and 5′ intronic enhancer (Hisatsune et
Stan et al. Page 8
Dev Cell. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2013 December 11.

al., 2005) (Fig. 5A). From six founder lines, we selected a line expressing PV1HA in all
organs (Fig. S4A–B) at ~30–50% of the native PV1 levels in tissues where it is normally
expressed such as the lung (Fig. 5B). In 4 week-old mice, PV1-HA was detected in ECs of
all vessels, large arteries and veins, capillaries in the heart and muscle, brain vessels and
glomerulus and less in the sinusoids of the liver (Fig. S4A–B and not shown). Mosaicism of
transgene expression was detected by confocal microscopy (Fig. S5A) and 14.6 (+/− 10.3)%
of CD31 or VEC (CD144) positive lung ECs did not express PV1-HA by flow cytometry
(not shown). In 4 weeks old mice, PV1-HA was detected in ECs of all vessels, large arteries
and veins, capillaries in the heart and muscle, brain vessels and glomerulus and less in the
sinusoids of the liver (Fig. S4A–B and not shown). VEC-PV1HA+/tg
 mice did not exhibit
any overt phenotype in terms of survival, fertility, growth, blood composition or
cardiovascular function.
VEC-PV1HA+/tg
;PV1−/−(PV1
ECRC) mice were generated (Fig. 5A) and displayed ~30–50%
reconstitution of PV1HA (Fig. 5B) when normalized to the lung endothelial content, as
measured by VE cadherin levels, an accepted endothelial marker in the adult (Salomon et
al., 1992). These subnative levels of PV1 reconstitution significantly increased PV1
ECRC
mice survival to ~60% of expected Mendelian frequency, on a mixed background (Fig. 5C).
Moreover, 100% of the PV1
ECRC mice that survived to 28 days were alive up to 1 year later
(Fig. 5D).
Importantly, PV1
ECRC mice displayed diaphragm restoration in the lung, adrenal, kidney,
pancreas, thyroid and intestine (Fig. 5E, Table 1). Consistent with the idea of the mosaicism
and hypomorphic PV1 expression (Fig. S4A), in kidney peritubular capillaries, there were
isolated ECs that did not form diaphragms or express PV1 (Fig. S4D). Less than 5% of
glomerular capillaries exhibiting fenestrae with diaphragms, and no caveolae diaphragms
were detected in the heart (Fig. 5Eh), muscle or aorta ECs (not shown).
PV1
ECRC mice had normal growth (Fig. 5F), near normal level of plasma proteins (Fig. 5G)
CHOL and TGs (Fig. 5H) and no edema in organs with fenestrated endothelia (Fig. S4C).
Thus, re-expression of PV1 in ECs of PV1
−/− mice restores diaphragm formation and
rescues their complex vascular leak syndrome.
Discussion
Here, we demonstrated in vivo the essential role of PV1 in the formation of FDs and SDs on
endothelial organelles such as fenestrae, TEC and caveolae, whereas the lack of expression
of PV1 does not affect the formation of these organelles. Most importantly, by enabling the
formation of the diaphragms of fenestrae/TEC, PV1 plays a critical role in regulating basal
permeability to proteins and the maintenance of blood composition. Removal of the
diaphragms resulted in early death of mice caused by severe, non-inflammatory protein
losing enteropathy. Thus, the role of PV1-containing diaphragms in regulation of basal
permeability is absolutely essential for postnatal survival.
At the ultrastructural/subcellular level, we show that the deletion of PV1 results in complete
absence of SDs and FDs in situ, confirming previous in vitro data (Ioannidou et al., 2006;
Stan et al., 2004) and further validating our model by which PV1 is necessary for diaphragm
formation. Notwithstanding the inherent technical difficulties in ascertaining the loss of
diaphragms by electron microscopy (depending on the thickness of the section and on how
much of the fenestrae/TEC pore rim was encompassed in the section), we did not find a
single diaphragm in any of the structures we were able to examine in PV1
−/− and
PV1
ECKO-Tie2
 mice. The hypomorphic rescue of PV1 in ECs restores all types of
diaphragms and TEC. Interestingly, expression of PV1 in vivo restores diaphragms only in
Stan et al. Page 9

$watermark-text $watermark-text $watermark-text

the ECs where they natively occur, demonstrating the essential but not sufficient role PV1 in
the diaphragms formation.
PV1 is not necessary for the formation of fenestrae/TEC pores and caveolae. Surface density
of these organelles is similar in PV1
−/− and WT littermates. The only observed difference is
in a greater variation in the diameter of fenestrae and TEC in PV1
−/− mice. These findings
are in agreement with the idea generated decades ago that a possible function of diaphragms
was to maintain the size, shape and distribution of the fenestrae (Clementi and Palade,
1969b), recently bolstered by in vitro studies (Ioannidou et al., 2006). No conduits
resembling TEC without diaphragms were found, suggesting either that PV1 is required for
TEC pore formation or, more likely, that TEC are precursors of fenestrae and the double
diaphragms are required for maintenance of the channel length.
Formation of the diaphragms regulates basal permeability to proteins. Deletion of FDs
causes leakage of plasma proteins into the peritoneal cavity and into the interstitium of
organs provided with fenestrated capillaries (i.e. intestine, kidney, pancreas) but not in
organs with continuous endothelium (heart, muscle, lung) in PV1
−/− and PV1
ECKO mice. In
contrast, the sites where fenestrae have no FDs (i.e. liver sinusoids or glomerulus) do not
exhibit changes in permeability. The leakage involves most plasma proteins, up to the size
of IgM (mol radius 12nm), or tracers as large as 2×106KD dextran (mol radius 27.9nm), but
not the components of the largest lipoprotein particles such as VLDL/chylomicron remnants.
We demonstrate that nanoparticles as large as 25nm are able to exit fenestrated vessels on a
very fast time scale (5min). Although the EM micrographs do not allow dynamic
visualization of the site of leakage, the gold particles (especially the larger ones) were found
closely associated with clusters of fenestrae/TEC pores, thus bolstering our claims that in
absence of diaphragms fenestrae/TEC pores leak plasma molecules with much larger
diameter that in WT.
Thus, the FDs act as size selective molecular sieves with a function reminiscent of that of
the podocyte slit diaphragms in the mature kidney glomerulus, which have been more
intensively studied. While the molecular architecture is not precisely the same (i.e. spoke
and wheel radial vs. zipper-like parallel fibrils), both types of diaphragms make use of
transmembrane N-linked glycoproteins with large extracellular domains (i.e. PV1 and
nephrin) revealing a general building principle of vascular sieves. While additional proteins
(e.g. Neph-1, FAT1) enable the formation of slit diaphragms, the FD structure might involve
other proteins in addition to PV1, which we are actively pursuing.
Lack of caveolar SDs in fenestrated endothelia does not seem to have a role in plasma
protein extravasation seen in PV1
−/− mice, as no differences in EB extravasation are
observed between the lungs of PV1
−/− mice and control, where capillaries contain only
caveolar SDs. The lack of role of caveolar SDs in basal permeability is also suggested by the
fact that permeability to proteins in continuous endothelia where caveolae do (i.e. lung) or
do not (i.e. heart, skeletal muscle) have SDs is similar [reviewed in (Sarin, 2010)], or it is
enhanced when the SDs are present (King et al., 2004). How much of the increased
permeability to proteins in PV1
−/− mice is the result of the deletion of diaphragms of
fenestrae or those of TEC and whether knocking out PV1 deletes the proteoglycans within
fenestrae, is a matter of further study.
Lack of diaphragms resulted in defects in blood composition and protein losing enteropathy
causing early death of PV1
−/− mice on mixed background. PV1
−/− and PV1
ECKO (but not
PV1
HCKO) mice have numerous homeostatic defects, which are rescued by the
reconstitution of the diaphragms in ECs of PV1
ECRC mice, an important confirmation that
the defects are directly related to the loss of diaphragms. These defects include significant

growth retardation, declining plasma protein levels, increase in TG-rich lipoprotein particles,
edema and ascites formation, consistent with protein calorie malnutrition. The
hypoproteinemia is central to the PV1−/− phenotype. While decreased protein production,
enhanced protein catabolism and protein loss by nephrotic syndrome were ruled out,
intestinal loss of protein as a cause of hypoproteinemia was confirmed by permeability
studies in PV1
−/− and PV1
ECKO mice, which demonstrated sharply increased protein
extravasation and loss in the intestinal lumen.
The increases in TG-rich lipoprotein particles in PV1
−/− mice follow hypoproteinemia, the
former being a known sequel of hypoproteinemia in both humans and rodents (Shearer and
Kaysen, 2006; Yoshino et al., 1993). However, the severity of plasma TG increases in
PV1
−/− mice is unusually high and might reflect the magnitude of the protein loss in PV1
−/−
mice or additional mechanisms by which PV1 regulates TG metabolism. The increase in
plasma concentration of ApoB48-containing CMRs with diameters much larger than the
diaphragm-less fenestrae pores brings strong support to the idea of an increase in the upper
pore size of the capillary wall of the PV1−/− fenestrated vessels. Conversely, the leakage is
restricted to probes smaller than the fenestrae pores.
In the light of the gradual character of the changes in PV1
−/− and PV1
ECKO mice on the
mixed 129Sv/J × C57BL/6J background, a plausible scenario unfolds by which the deletion
of FDs initially cause extravasation of proteins and moderate hypoproteinemia due to the
increase in the volume of the compartment to which plasma proteins have access. This
volume now includes the intravascular space and the volume of the interstitial space of the
organs with fenestrated vessels. Here, the presence of excess protein will cause gradual
edema further increasing the protein compartment volume, which may accentuate
hypoproteinemia. It is not clear what is the effect of the plasma protein extravasation and
edema on the function of most organs with fenestrated vessels. Future experiments using
innovative inducible, vascular bed endothelial specific deletion of PV1 might be able to
answer this question. What is clear is that PV1 deletion in mice on mixed background results
in an important intestinal edema, which may constitute the basis of the demonstrated
intestinal barrier failure and intestinal protein loss. The latter provides a rational explanation
for the severe hypoproteinemia and the clear signs of protein calorie malnutrition syndrome
resembling kwashiorkor in humans (e.g. growth retardation, severe hypoproteinemia,
ascites, hypertriglyceridemia and lipid deposits), which may be the cause of death in PV1−/−
mice.
PV1
−/− and PV1
ECKO (but nor PV1
HCKO) mice exhibited reduced survival with varying
severity depending on the background, with the 129/SvJ background mitigating the effects
and allowing postnatal life. In all PV1
−/− and PV1
ECKO mice examined PV1 and the
diaphragms were completely absent; thus the difference in survival was not due to
incomplete penetrance of the diaphragm-free phenotype. It is possible that differences in the
severity of leakage (in rate and/or components), or the impact of the leakage on the function
of critical organs (e.g. circumventricular organs and endocrine glands), or effects of PV1
outside fenestrae, might explain the differences between backgrounds. Further studies in
mice with conditional time-resolved deletion/reconstitution of PV1 should elucidate these
issues.
While our paper was under review, two papers from the same group were published
describing the PV1−/− phenotype in mice generated by a targeted trap insertion in intron 1 of
Plvap locus (Herrnberger et al., 2012a; Herrnberger et al., 2012b). In agreement with our
data, Herrnberger et al confirm that PV1 is essential for diaphragm formation in caveolae,
fenestrae and TEC and is not required for the formation of fenestrae pores themselves. These
lend considerable support to our premise that PV1−/− mice constitute a good model for

$watermark-text $watermark-text $watermark-text

studying the role of diaphragms in permeability, to which they also agree. Herrnberger et al
also observe mouse background-dependent decreased survival, small pancreata and
cutaneous hemorrhages in mice that die in utero (which we do not show in this paper) in
PV1−/− mice. Interestingly, while we do not observe any statistically relevant changes in
surface density of fenestral pores in kidney or qualitative changes in pancreas, Herrnberger
et al. report a reduction in fenestrae pore numbers in kidney and pancreas although no
formal quantification was performed. Another difference, related to the first, is that they did
not detect pancreatic edema, which they assessed by qualitative morphology only. These
data lead them to speculate that PV1 knockout mouse could have reduced permeability. In
contrast, our measurements demonstrate pancreatic, intestinal, kidney and skin edema with
dramatically increased permeability in organs with fenestrated vessels.
These differences could be explained in part by the different mouse genetic backgrounds
used in both studies, as we both clearly demonstrated the impact of the background on
phenotype severity. The different designs for the null allele (trap insertion in intron 1 and
LacZ expression vs. deletion of exons 2–5) could also be contributing factors. These
differences should inform future studies of PV1 function such as ruling out dominant
negative effects of truncation PV1 mutants or the effects of exogenous protein expression.
In summary, deletion of PV1 protein in vivo allowed us to demonstrate that the diaphragms
of fenestrae and TEC are critical for the maintenance of endothelial barrier integrity and
basal permeability. In the absence of such diaphragms, plasma protein extravasation
produces a non-inflammatory protein losing enteropathy resulting in protein calorie
malnutrition and ultimately death. Our results and the unique mouse models we have created
provide the foundations for evaluating numerous aspects of basal permeability in fenestrated
vascular beds.
Experimental Procedures
Mice
Generation of the PV1L/L mice—The PV1loxP targeting vector loxP recombination
sites in intron 1 and 5, schematized in Fig. 1A, was constructed by Bacterial Artificial
Chromosome recombination technology. PV1
L/L mice were generated by knock-in using
homologous recombination in mice (Fig. S1C–D) at Dartmouth Transgenics Facility.
Targeted PV1 deletion—PV1
L/L mice were bred to CMV-cre, Tie2-cre, VEC-cre and
Vav-cre mice, to delete exons 2–5 of the Plvap locus in the germline, endothelial and
hematopoietic or hematopoietic only compartments. Genotypes generated are detailed in
Table 2.
Generation of VEC-PV1HA transgenic mice—The VEC-PV1HA transgenic cassette
consisting of the VEC promoter, mouse PV1 fused to 3xHA epitope, SV40 polyA signal
sequence and the 5′ 5kb of the VE Cadherin intron 1 was used for transgenic mouse
generation at Dartmouth Transgenic Facility. VEC-PV1HA+/− lines were characterized in
terms of PV1 expression pattern in blood vessels.
PV1HA reconstitution in PV1−/− mice—VEC-PV1HA+/− mice were bred to PV1
+/− to
obtain VEC-PV1HA+/− ;PV1
+/− mice, which were further bred to PV1
+/− to obtain
PV1HA+/−;PV1−/− (PV1
ECRC) mice.
Survival analysis—The survival rate of different mouse genotypes mice was calculated
from the total observed numbers in each mouse line and assuming a Mendelian distribution
Stan et al. Page 12
Dev Cell. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2013 December 11.
$watermark-text $watermark-text $watermark-text

of genotypes according to the breeding scheme employed. The statistical significance was
calculated using the CHI2
 test.
Transmission electron microscopy and morphometry—Organs were harvested and
processed for routine transmission electron microscopy, as described (Tkachenko et al.,
2012). Briefly, mice were euthanized with CO2, and their vasculature immediately flushed
free of blood by 5 min perfusion via the left ventricle using the left atrium as an outlet (also
ensuring the perfusion of lung vasculature) of HBSS containing calcium and magnesium
(HBSS-CM) followed by 10min of EM fixative (2% glutaraldehyde, 3% paraformaldehyde,
0.1M sodium cacodylate, pH7.2). Tissues were harvested, cut in 1×2mm blocks and fixed
further in fresh fixative, rinsed in 0.1M sodium cacodylate, postfixed in 1% OsO4 in 0.1M
sodium cacodylate, briefly rinsed, stained en block with Kellenberger’s uranyl acetate in
water, dehydrated through graded ethanol and embedded in LX-112 resin (Ladd Research)
using propylene oxide for ethanol substitution. Ultrathin sections of 20–40nm were cut using
an ultrasonic diamond knife (Diatome) mounted on grids, stained with uranyl acetate and
lead citrate and examined in a Jeol 1010 electron microscope using a bottom mount AMD
camera.
For morphometry, pictures of 75 random capillaries (i.e. vessels with <10μm diameter) were
taken from three animals per group (2–5 blocks/animal, 4 animals/genotype) at a
magnification of 5,000X. The number of the caveolae, fenestrae and TEC were expressed as
a function of membrane length examined (at least 10μm in each section). The number of
fenestrae/TEC pores per μm linear length of membrane was determined by the method of
Milici, et al (Milici et al., 1985; Tkachenko et al., 2012). Student’s t test was used to
determine statistical significance between different groups.
Scanning electron microscopy—Organs were harvested and fixed as above,
osmicated, dehydrated in graded ethanol, freeze-fractured in liquid nitrogen and transferred
back in 100% ethanol from where they were subjected to critical point dying using a Samdri
795 device (tousimis). Dried tissue blocks were mounted on carbon tape coated 12mm stubs,
osmium coated using an OPC-60N Osmium Plasma Coater Model (SPI) and examined
under XL-30 ESEM-FEG field emission gun environmental scanning electron microscope
(FEI) operated at 15kV. Images were collected at 10,000–20,000x magnification.
mRNA isolation and real time quantitative PCR—Tissues were collected in
RNAlater (Qiagen) and total RNA isolated using Trizol (Sigma). RNA integrity and purity
were determined using Bioanalyzer (Agilent) and NanoDrop (Thermo-Fisher). RNA was
reverse transcribed and amplified for quantitative real-time PCR using Taqman® Gene
Expression Assays (Applied Biosystems). A list of the Gene Expression Assays used is in
Supplemental Methods. The comparative CT method (2−ΔΔCT) of relative quantitation was
used to compare different genotypes.
Isolation of mouse lung total membranes and blotting
Lung membrane lysates were obtained as described (Stan et al., 1999a). Proteins were
separated by SDS- polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and either silver stained or transferred
to PVDF membranes and immunoblotted with various antibodies.
Isolation of cells for genotyping or flow cytometry—Mouse tissues were flushed
free of blood, organs were excised, collagenase treated, a single cell suspension prepared
and labeled with antibodies as described in Supplemental Methods.

Isolation of blood plasma—Mice were euthanized, their thoracic cavity opened and
blood collected from the heart on heparin Microtainer tubes (BD Bioscience). The samples
were centrifuged at 6000xg for 15 min to obtain platelet-poor plasma.
Isolation of hematopoietic cells—Blood was harvested in EDTA-coated Microtainer
tubes (BD Biosciences), centrifuged to pellet the blood cells, red blood cells were lysed,
white blood cells were collected by centrifugation and used for genomic DNA isolation.
Peritoneal cells were harvested by peritoneal lavage using PBS/2% serum albumin/5mM
EDTA and were profiled to determine content of CD45-expressing cells, usually >95%.
Spleens were dissociated by mechanical disruption through a 70μm mesh, yielding <5%
non-hematopoietic cells.
Blood plasma measurements (comprehensive metabolic panels, lipid profiles, albumin and
total protein) were done on a chemistry analyzer (Roche MODULAR PPE) by the
Dartmouth Department of Pathology Clinical Chemistry Laboratory. Protein subclass
determination was done on serum on a Hydrasys-LC system (Sebia). QuantiChrome™ kits
for total protein, albumin, CHOL and TGs determination were used, as per manufacturer’s
instructions (BioAssay Systems). Random or fasting venous blood was collected with a
heparin coated capillary tube, and spotted on the strips of an Accu-Check Instant Plus device
(Roche) as per manufacturer’s instructions.
Serum IgG, IgM and IgA levels were determined using ELISA kits (ICL), as per
manufacturer’s instructions.
Plasma lipoprotein fractionation was done by FPLC (Superose 6, GE Healthcare) at a
flow rate of 0.25 ml/min, and 0.5-ml fractions were collected.
Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Fat Volume Determination were performed on a 7T
Varian Unity Inova magnetic resonance spectrometer equipped with a triple axes gradients,
as described in Supplemental Methods.
Organ/Body weight ratio—Organs were removed, weighed, dried in an oven at 80°C for
7 days, weighed again and wet/dry weight ratio was calculated.
Histology—Mouse organs were fixed in 10% buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin.
For Oil RedO fat content analysis, organs were fixed (24h, RT) in methanol-free 4%
paraformaldehyde in PBS, followed by cryoembedding in OCT (Tissue-Tek).
Evans Blue dye extravasation assay—Under anesthesia with isofluorane, mice were
injected i.v. with 100μl/20g body weight of sterile 2% Evans Blue, 6% mouse serum
albumin (99.9% pure, MP Bio) in 0.9 % saline. To determine Evans Blue extravasation in
the organs, the tracer was allowed to circulate for the noted amount of time, when the mice
were euthanized and their vasculature perfused (1ml/min, 10 min, RT) with PBS via the left
and right ventricles to remove the intraluminal dye from the systemic and pulmonary
circulation, respectively. Organs of interest were harvested, weighed, extracted in
formamide and Evans Blue content calculated as detailed in Supplemental Methods. The
Evans Blue content in the peritoneal cavity and intestinal lumen was determined at 5 and
15min without PBS perfusion ensuring minimal disruption to the circulation.
Leakage of tracers directly labeled with fluorophores—Under anesthesia with
isofluorane, PV1
−/− mice were injected i.v. with 100μl/10g body weight of sterile
fluorescent tracer in 0.9% saline. The tracers used were bovine serum albumin–Alexa647
(250μM), mouse IgG–Alexa555 (100μM), mouse IgM–Alexa647 and FITC-dextrans with

$watermark-text $watermark-text $watermark-text

molecular averages of 10KD, 70KD and 2×106D. At the indicated time points, mice were
euthanized, ascites fluid collected in PV1
−/− mice and its fluorescence intensity was
determined.
Leakage of albumin-gold nanoparticles—Gold nanoparticles of 10, 15 and 25nm
average diameter (EMS) were separately stabilized by coating with bovine serum albumin
per manufacturer’s instructions, collected by ultracentrifugation, mixed to yield a triple
tracer mixture which was adjusted to 1% bovine serum albumin in 0.9 % saline. PV1
−/− and
WT mice (n=4/group, 4 week old) were euthanized and their blood was flushed out by
perfusion with PBS via the left ventricle, while ligatures were placed on the abdominal aorta
above and below the renal arteries and the abdominal aorta was cannulated using a custom
made catheter. The kidneys and adrenals were perfused (0.5 ml/min, 5min, RT) with triple
tracer preparation via abdominal aorta using a nick in the inferior vena cava as an outlet,
followed by removal of excess gold particles by perfusion of PBS (0.5 ml/min, 5min at RT)
and EM fixative perfusion (0.5 ml/min, 10min at RT). Kidneys and adrenals were collected,
trimmed into blocks and processed for LX112 embedding and sectioning, as described
above. Ultrathin sections were stained with only uranyl acetate to facilitate gold particle
detection.
Morphometric analysis of gold nanoparticle extravasation was carried out on EM
micrographs of capillaries (i.e. vessels with diameters of less than 10μm) from 3 mice per
genotype. For each capillary profile, the number of gold particles of each size found outside
the vessel lumen was determined and expressed as particles per micrometer of membrane
length.
Statistical significance was determined by two tailed Student’s t test, analysis of variance
(ANOVA), or CHI2
 test, as appropriate.

• PV1 is required for the formation of stomatal and fenestral diaphragms
• Lack of diaphragms in fenestrated endothelia causes vascular leak of plasma
proteins
• Vascular leak results in severe hypoproteinemia and hypertriglyceridemia
