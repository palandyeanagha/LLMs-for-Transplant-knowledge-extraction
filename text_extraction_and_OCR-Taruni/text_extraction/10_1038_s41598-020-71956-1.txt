To test the association between bilateral nephrectomies in patients with autosomal recessive 
polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD) and long-term clinical outcome and to identify risk factors for 
severe outcomes, a dataset comprising 504 patients from the international registry studyARegPKD
was analyzed for characteristics and complications of patients with very early (≤ 3 months;VEBNE)
and early (4–15 months; EBNE) bilateral nephrectomies. Patients with very early dialysis (VED,
onset ≤ 3 months) without bilateral nephrectomies and patients with total kidney volumes (TKV)
comparable toVEBNE infants served as additional control groups.We identified 19 children with
VEBNE, 9 with EBNE, 12 withVED and 11 in theTKV control group.VEBNE patients suffered more
frequently from severe neurological complications in comparison to all control patients.Very early
bilateral nephrectomies and documentation of severe hypotensive episodes were independent risk 
factors for severe neurological complications. Bilateral nephrectomies within the first 3 months of life
are associated with a risk of severe neurological complications later in life. Our data support a very
cautious indication of very early bilateral nephrectomies in ARPKD, especially in patients with residual 
kidney function, and emphasize the importance of avoiding severe hypotensive episodes in this at-risk 
cohort.

Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD) is a severe and mostly early-onset hepatorenal disorder 
mainly caused by mutations in the PKHD1 gene1–3
. Mutations in a second gene, DZIP1L, have recently been 
associated with an ARPKD phenotype3,4
. Affected newborns may suffer from massive kidney enlargement and 
may require early kidney replacement therapy (KRT). Peritoneal dialysis (PD) is then considered the dialysis 
modality of choice5
. It has been suggested that large kidneys may contribute to respiratory problems and may 
hamper nutritional support6,7
. The respiratory situation in ARPKD neonates can be challenging due to pulmonary 
hypoplasia and additional abdominal pressure by PD. Furthermore, concerns about the feasibility of PD in cases 
of massive renal enlargement have been raised. In some infants with severe ARPKD, uni- or bilateral nephrecto￾mies are therefore performed with the aim to improve the respiratory, nutritional and dialysis conditions6–8
. How￾ever, nephrectomies have not been shown to improve the respiratory situation and the rationale for nutritional 
improvement is based on small studies regarding unilateral nephrectomy9–11. Even in severely affected infants, 
residual kidney function may be preserved in ARPKD and may even improve during the first months of life12. 
Obviously, bilateral nephrectomies result in a life-long need for KRT. Additionally, arterial hypotension has been 
reported after bilateral nephrectomies and may contribute to neurological or ophthalmological complications in 
young PD patients13–16. The association of early bilateral nephrectomies in general and of the timing of the second 
nephrectomy in particular with long-term outcome in ARPKD patients remains unclear. To address this topic, we 
analyzed the comprehensive pre-, peri- and postnatal information captured in the ARegPKD registry study17,18.
Results
Characteristics of patient subgroups. At the timepoint of analysis, 504 patients with the clinical diag￾nosis of ARPKD and sufficient data quality were registered in the ARegPKD registry. Of these, 19 patients (3.8%) 
with very early bilateral nephrectomies (within first 3 months of life, VEBNE) and further 9 patients (1.8%) 
with early bilateral nephrectomies (first nephrectomy within first 15  months of life, second nephrectomy at 
age 4–15 months, EBNE) were identified. We included a control group of 11 patients, who had very large total 
kidney volumes (TKV) comparable to VEBNE patients (TKV>  ~200 ml, measured by ultrasound within the 
first 3 months of life), but were not treated with early nephrectomy or dialysis (TKV control group). Pole-to-pole 
lengths, single kidney volumes and total kidney volumes did not differ significantly between VEBNE and TKV 
control patients but TKV control patients were slightly older at measurement (Table 1). To account for effects of 
very early dialysis (VED) onset, an additional control group was defined with 12 ARPKD patients with dialysis 
onset within the first 3 months of life without bilateral nephrectomies in their disease course (VED). Patients 
were grouped according to their clinical status at time of last documented observation in the registry or at time 
prior to their death. The patient characteristics regarding nephrectomies and KRT are depicted in Table 2.

Indications for nephrectomies. In VEBNE patients, indications for nephrectomies encompassed respira￾tory failure and/or ventilation problems, abdominal distension and/or massive kidney enlargement and onset 
of or problems with PD (Table 2). Most patients with sequential nephrectomies started dialysis after the first 
nephrectomy (11/17, 65%). Two patients of the VED group received very early unilateral nephrectomy. In the 
TKV control group, two patients received unilateral nephrectomy during combined liver and kidney transplan￾tation surgery later in life.
Pre‑ and perinatal characteristics. Detailed information on patient characteristics is provided in Table 3. 
VEBNE and TKV control patients more frequently showed poor postnatal respiratory adaptation and were more 
often admitted to neonatal intensive care units (NICU). Other characteristics—including gestational age, birth 
weight, length, head circumference as well as Apgar scores and requirement of respiratory support—did not 
show relevant differences between the groups.
Long‑term complications with focus on neurological development and risk factors for severe 
neurological complications. In a first step, we addressed the occurrence of relevant symptoms or com￾plications including blood pressure alterations, neurological symptoms, sepsis, cardiopulmonary resuscitation 
and death in a descriptive manner in the four different patient groups. Among all complications investigated, the 
most profound differences were observed in the neurological outcome: seizures and severe neurological com￾plications encompassing ischemic defects, hypoxic brain damage, brain infarct, parenchymal defect, severe neu￾rodevelopmental disorder and optic neuropathy with vision loss occurred more frequently in VEBNE patients. 
While 12/19 (63%) VEBNE patients were affected by severe neurological complications, this was true for only 
2/9 (22%) EBNE, 2/12 (17%) VED and none of the 11 TKV control patients. Of the 12 affected VEBNE patients, 
three suffered from cerebral ischemia, three from infarction, bleeding or parenchymal defects, three from optic 
neuropathy (with vision loss), two from combined cerebral ischemia or hypoxemia and optic neuropathy, and 
one from cerebral ischemia with bleeding. The two EBNE patients developed sinus vein thrombosis and bilateral 
cerebral infarctions, the two VED patients developed posthypoxic ischemic lesions after a very difficult postna￾tal adaptation and hydrocephalus with brain atrophy. Neurodevelopmental delay occurred most frequently in 
VEBNE patients. In a re-survey with specific questions on the psychomotoric development, only one of 17 (6%) 
studied VEBNE patients was classified to have a normal development compared to 2/8 (25%) EBNE patients, 
5/11 (46%) VED patients and 5/8 (63%) TKV control patients. Approximately one third of VEBNE patients suf￾fered from severely or very severely affected psychomotoric development each. Younger ages at the timepoint of 
second nephrectomy were more frequently documented in those patients with severe neurological and devel￾Table 1.  Sonographic kidney measurements in patients with very early bilateral nephrectomies and patients

opmental complications, especially timepoints of second nephrectomy within the first 3 months of life (Suppl. 
Figure S1). The proportions of patients receiving some form of specific therapies for developmental complica￾tions were high in all four patient groups, ranging from 55% in VED to 94% in VEBNE patients. Microcephaly 
was hardly found at birth but was most frequently documented in VEBNE patients in the further course (11/19, 
58%). Severe hyper- and hypotensive episodes as well as cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) were reported 
for subcohorts of VEBNE and EBNE patients, without reports in VED and TKV control patients. Proportions 
of patients with a septic episode prior to the evaluated neurological complication did not differ significantly 
between the groups (Table 4).
Follow-up time was similar for VEBNE, EBNE and TKV control patients, but shorter for VED patients 
(Table 4). Severe neurological complications were further studied over time using Kaplan–Meier analyses and 
Cox regression analyses. Survival without severe neurological complications after 7 years was approximately 30% 
in VEBNE, 80% in EBNE, 70% in VED patients and 100% in TKV control patients according to Kaplan–Meier 
survival analysis (Fig. 1). Thus, VEBNE patients showed significantly worse outcome than EBNE or TKV control 
patients with a similar trend compared to VED patients. Severe neurological complications in the VEBNE group 
were evident within the 14 months of life in most cases (10/12). Only in two patients, atrophy of the optic nerve 
was diagnosed at the ages of 2.8 and 6.6 years.

Overall, severe neurological complications occurred in 16 of 51 (31%) analyzed patients (Table 5). According 
to Cox regression analysis, the report of severe neurological complications was associated with multiple factors, 
such as documentation of microcephaly during the course of follow-up as well as weaker and more common 
neurological symptoms like seizures and reports of severe hypertensive and hypotensive episodes. Furthermore, 
patients with very early bilateral nephrectomies seemed to be at special risk.
To identify independent risk factors associated with severe neurological complications, multivariate Cox 
regression analysis with consecutive backward selection was performed (including seizures, documentation of 
microcephaly, severe hypertensive episodes, severe hypotensive episodes and VEBNE), which revealed the report 
of a severe hypotensive episode and very early bilateral nephrectomies to be independent risk factors for severe 
neurological complications (Table 5). In this multivariate analysis, patients with very early bilateral nephrectomies 
were at fivefold elevated risk for severe neurological complications.
Deaths. Three VEBNE patients died due to cerebral ischemia (age 3.2  months), respiratory failure 
(7.8  months) and massive postoperative bleeding after revision of dialysis catheter (age 73.8  months). Two 
EBNE patients died, one due to a septic episode in leukemia (age 40.4  months) and the other patient due 
to aspiration (75.0 months). Causes of death in six VED patients were indicated as sepsis (ages 5.4 months, 
5.7 months, 13.3 months), lung hemorrhage (age 1.8 months) and parental wish to withdraw care in two cases 
(ages 0.8 months, 2.2 months). Importantly, four of the six deceased VED patients did not display major or 
severe neurological complications before death. Three out of the four VED patients that passed away without 
withdrawal of care died after the fifth month of life. One patient from the TKV control group died shortly post￾natally due to respiratory failure.

Discussion
The management of severely affected neonates and infants with ARPKD remains a matter of intense debate. 
The aim of this study was to examine the association of the timing of bilateral nephrectomies with long-term 
complications in ARPKD patients.
In our analysis, ARPKD patients with very early bilateral nephrectomies (VEBNE) within the first 3 months 
of life showed significantly more neurological complications than patients who underwent bilateral nephrecto￾mies receiving their second nephrectomy after the third month of life (EBNE). The severe neurological anoma￾lies observed in VEBNE patients encompassed cerebral ischemia or infarcts, parenchymal brain defects, brain 
volume decrease, subdural bleeding and (anterior ischemic) optic neuropathy. These complications occurred 
predominantly during the first year of life.
The rationale of drawing a line for evaluation of consequences of bilateral nephrectomies at the age of 
3 months was based on two considerations: firstly, major maturation processes of autonomic cardiovascular 
control seem to occur within the first 3 months of life19,20. Animal models suggest that renal sympathetic nerve 
control matures postnatally21. Secondly, both plasma renin activities and aldosterone levels22,23 have been reported 
to peak within the first 3 months with a steep decline afterwards. Data from healthy infants demonstrated a 
remarkable increase of systolic blood pressure during the first 6 weeks and a physiologic dip of diastolic blood 
pressure after birth with a gradual increase during the first year of life from month two to three on24. Summarizing 
these hypotheses, the removal of both kidneys in this early phase of life might result in the maximum impact by 
abolishing blood pressure autoregulation. Plotting the occurrence of severe neurological complications against 
the age at second nephrectomy supports the choice of drawing a line at the age of 3 months as critical time point 
(Suppl. Figure S1).
Interestingly, our analysis demonstrated that VEBNE and severe hypotensive episodes were independently 
associated with severe neurological complications. In addition to VEBNE additional factors leading to hypo￾tensive episodes seem to be involved, e.g. acute illnesses25. Previous smaller case series reported an anephric 
status and ARPKD as risk factors for development of anterior ischemic optic neuropathy in patients on PD26. 
Hypovolemia has been reported in half of the affected infants with anterior ischemic optic neuropathy on PD26. In 
our study, optic neuropathy was frequently observed in the VEBNE group. One might speculate about common 
pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying to all types of cerebral defects, such as reduced cerebral autoregula￾tion and chronic hypotension with increased vulnerability in acute hypotensive episodes. Fluid management per 
se can pose major challenges in infants on PD, but might affect blood pressure more immediately in anephric 
infants. In our analysis, we did not have comprehensive data on the fluid status of patients. It is worth noting 
that cardiopulmonary resuscitation was documented most frequently in the VEBNE patient group. Despite the 
challenges of fluid management in anephric infants, PD remains the preferred modality for ARPKD infants11. 
A recent analysis showed that technique survival in ARPKD is comparable to that observed in other early-onset 
kidney diseases, although PD in ARPKD may require smaller fill volumes and/or more cycles27. Our analysis 
emphasizes in particular the association of documented pronounced hypotensive episodes with severe neurologi￾cal complications in ARPKD patients receiving early bilateral nephrectomies and underlines the recommendation 
of very tight blood pressure control for all anephric children on PD. Furthermore, measures to avoid hypotensive 
episodes on PD need to be considered, e.g. by avoiding high glucose solutions or by sodium supplementation 
in dialysate and nutritionally25,28,29. On the other hand, ARPKD specific therapeutic options and clinical studies 
are eagerly awaited for this severely affected patient population.
None of the TKV control patients with massively enlarged kidneys developed severe neurological compli￾cations. Caution is required not to anticipate postnatal severe courses in all cases of newborns with pre- and 
perinatal anomalies30.
Severe neurological complications were observed in two VED patients: in one patient cerebral ischemia 
occurred during a very difficult postnatal adaptation requiring intense cardiorespiratory support and unilateral 
nephrectomy. This patient passed away at the age of 4 weeks after withdrawal of intensive care treatment upon 
parental request. The other patient died from sepsis at 13 months of age after documentation of hydrocephalus 
with brain atrophy 1 month earlier. All four of the six deceased VED infants who did not experience severe 
neurological complications deceased within the first 8 months of life. This is important for the interpretation of 
the Kaplan–Meier survival analysis for severe neurological complications (Fig. 1). Due to their early death, these 
patients were no longer at risk for severe neurological complications. Thus, death could be a competing risk for 
severe neurological complications in this specific subcohort. Survival without severe neurological complications 
tended to be better in VED compared to VEBNE patients, although statistical significance was missed due to 
small sample size. Importantly, the majority of the deceased VED patients died well beyond 3 months of age. 
EBNE patients were also severely affected with similar Apgar values as VEBNE and early dialysis dependency. 
Yet, only two of nine EBNE patients suffered from severe neurological sequelae, arguing against an intrinsic 
ARPKD-specific neurologic phenotype.
The current study faces limitations: as severely affected and/or early deceased patients are likely to be under￾represented in our registry study, the obtained sample sizes of the four groups are rather small. Furthermore, 
there might be a center bias in deciding for nephrectomies in infants. The risk factor severe hypotensive episodes 
needs to be interpreted carefully: the report and documentation might be biased by the personal perception of 
the attending physicians and severely affected children might spend more time in hospital, where blood pressure 
documentation could reveal anomalies more frequently. Hypotensive episodes are known to frequently occur 
within hypovolemia in infants on PD25,31,32. Our study describes interesting associations of severe hypotensive 
episodes and the decision to perform VEBNE with severe neurological complications, but we cannot prove 
causality due to the retrospective registry data underlying the analysis. Importantly, in severely affected infants 
there may be situations where the decision for uni- or bilateral nephrectomies appears inevitable. Given our

data a thorough discussion of all relevant aspects both with the parents and the attending medical team seems 
important.
Conclusion
Neurological complications occur more frequently in patients with bilateral nephrectomies performed during 
the first 3 months of life compared to patients with the second nephrectomy performed between 4 and 15 months 
of age. Our data suggest utmost caution in the decision-making process for very early bilateral nephrecto￾mies, especially in infants with partially conserved residual renal function, and support postponing the second 
nephrectomy when possible. Importantly, every effort should be made to avoid pronounced hypotensive episodes 
in this population.
Methods
Registry. The international cohort study ARegPKD follows patients with the clinical diagnosis of ARPKD 
according to the previously described protocol17,18. In summary, basic data and regular follow-up data sets are 
obtained and are subject to regular data quality control. The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Commit￾tee of the Faculty of Medicine of Cologne University and the Institutional Review Boards of participating sites. 
Informed consent was obtained from all subjects or, if subjects are under 18, from a parent and/or legal guardian 
according to applicable local regulations. All methods were carried out in accordance with relevant guidelines 
and regulations.
For this specific analysis ischemic brain defects, hypoxic brain damage, brain infarct, parenchymal defect, 
severe neurodevelopmental disorder and optic neuropathy with vision loss were rated as severe neurological 
complication. For detailed classification of neurocognitive development, we re-surveyed data on head circum￾ferences at birth and during further course, school education, specific therapies, developmental milestones 
and psychological/intelligence testing for the studied subcohort: psychomotoric development was classified as 
normal or mildly, severely or very severely disordered. Head circumferences at birth were graded in percentiles 
according to the revised Fenton growth chart33.
All PKHD1 variants were classified according to criteria of the American College of Medical Genetics 
(ACMG)34. Sonography-based kidney volumes were calculated according to the ellipsoid formula (length × 
width × depth × π/6) and standardized to standard deviation scores (SDS) to pediatric normal values35,36.
Statistics. Data analysis was performed on the dataset available in September 2018 using SPSS 25 (IBM 
Corp., Armonk, NY, USA) for statistical analyses. Data completeness varied by variable. Continuous variables 
were described using the number of non-missing values, mean and standard deviation (SD) as well as median 
and interquartile range (IQR). For binary or categorical variables, absolute and relative frequencies were pro￾vided. Event-free survival rates were estimated by the Kaplan–Meier method. Follow-up duration in the four 
groups were calculated using the reverse Kaplan–Meier method, displayed as median (IQR) and compared using 
log-rank test. Differences of (continuous) sonographic parameters between VEBNE and control group were 
compared by Mann–Whitney U test. Differences between the four patient groups were assessed by Kruskal–
Wallis tests for continuous and by chi-squared tests for binary or categorical variables. The statistical tests did 
not adjust formally for multiplicity due to the exploratory nature of the analysis. No imputation was performed.
To investigate the predictive value of clinical risk factors for severe neurological outcome, Cox regression anal￾ysis was performed for each risk factor separately. The parameters with a p value below 0.10 were then included 
in a Cox multiple regression analysis with consecutive backward selection for variables with a p value below 0.10.
To assess the differences of survival without severe neurological complications in the four patient groups, 
Kaplan–Meier analysis and log rank tests were used. All analyses are exploratory and p values of less than 0.05 
were considered significant in a descriptive manner in distinguishing between the groups.
