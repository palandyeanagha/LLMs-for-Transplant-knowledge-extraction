Background: Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) are a major fibrogenic cell type that contributes to collagen
accumulation during chronic liver disease. With increasing interest in developing antifibrotic therapies,
there is a need for cell lines that preserve the in vivo phenotype of human HSCs to elucidate pathways of
human hepatic fibrosis. We established and characterised two human HSC cell lines termed LX-1 and
LX-2, and compared their features with those of primary human stellate cells.
Methods and results: LX-1 and LX-2 were generated by either SV40 T antigen immortalisation (LX-1) or
spontaneous immortalisation in low serum conditions (LX-2). Both lines express a smooth muscle actin,
vimentin, and glial fibrillary acid protein, as visualised by immunocytochemistry. Similar to primary HSCs,
both lines express key receptors regulating hepatic fibrosis, including platelet derived growth factor
receptor b (bPDGF-R), obese receptor long form (Ob-RL), and discoidin domain receptor 2 (DDR2), and
also proteins involved in matrix remodelling; matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, tissue inhibitor of matrix
metalloproteinase (TIMP)-2, and MT1-MMP, as determined by western analyses. LX-2 have reduced
expression of TIMP-1. LX-2, but not LX-1, proliferate in response to PDGF. Both lines express mRNAs for
a1(I) procollagen and HSP47. Transforming growth factor b1 stimulation increased their a1(I) procollagen
mRNA expression, as determined by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. LX-2,
but not LX-1, cells are highly transfectable. Both lines had a retinoid phenotype typical of stellate cells.
Microarray analyses showed strong similarity in gene expression between primary HSCs and either LX-1
(98.4%) or LX-2 (98.7%), with expression of multiple neuronal genes.
Conclusions: LX-1 and LX-2 human HSC lines provide valuable new tools in the study of liver disease. Both
lines retain key features of HSCs. Two unique advantages of LX-2 are their viability in serum free media
and high transfectability.
Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) (previously known as Ito
cells, lipocytes, or fat storing cells) are a major cell type
responsible for liver fibrosis following their activation
into fibrogenic myofibroblast-like cells.1–3 With accumulating
insights into stellate cell biology, there is an increasing need
for renewable cell culture models that faithfully recapitulate
their in vivo phenotype. Indeed, much of our current
knowledge of stellate cell behaviour has been gained through
animal models and primary culture studies, particularly from
the rat. When cultured on uncoated plastic, stellate cells
undergo spontaneous activation that correlates closely with
their response in vivo.4 However, it is essential to validate
mechanisms elucidated from rodent models in human
stellate cells in order to establish their relevance to human
disease.
An important limitation of using human stellate cells has
been the infrequent and unpredictable availability of human
tissue suitable for cell isolation, as well as the modest yield
and frequent impurities that characterise these isolates. One
approach to overcome these difficulties has been to passage
fibroblast-like outgrowths from whole tissue sections, which
usually represent a heterogenous mixture of activated HSCs
with other hepatic cell types, including large vessel endothe￾lial cells and vascular smooth muscle cells. In addition to
their heterogeneity, the utility of explant outgrowths has
been limited by the finite number of passages the cells
undergo unless immortalised.5 Moreover, isolates from
human liver vary from prep to prep, making it difficult to
directly compare findings.
To overcome these issues of species specificity and culture
variability, and to provide a stable and unlimited source of
human HSCs that are homogenous, we have established two
new immortalised HSC cell lines, LX-1 and LX-2. These cell
lines have been extensively characterised and retain key
features of cytokine signalling, neuronal gene expression,
retinoid metabolism, and fibrogenesis, making them highly
suitable for culture based studies of human hepatic fibrosis.

antigen (SV40 T-antigen, mAb) was from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, California, USA). Antivimentin
and antiglial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP) monoclonal
antibodies were from NeoMarkers (Fremont, California,
USA). Antirabbit IgG fluorescein and antimouse IgG (H+L)

(Temecula, California, USA). A monoclonal antibody for
the platelet derived growth factor receptor b (bPDGF-R)
was from Transduction Laboratories (Newington, New
Hampshire, USA).
HSC isolation and culture
HSCs were isolated as previously described.7 Isolated HSCs
were cultured in M199 containing 10% fetal bovine serum
(FBS) 24 hours later and every 3–4 days thereafter. When the
cultures reached confluence, they were trypsinised (0.05%
trypsin/0.53 mM EDTA) and passaged at a ratio of 1:3.
Subsequent passages were performed every 7–10 days.
Transfection and immortalisation
HSCs subcultured to passage 3 were trypsinised and plated at
a density of approximately 40% confluence in a 10 cm dish.
The following day, the passage 4 cells were transfected with
the plasmid pRSVTag that encodes the SV40 large T antigen
under the control of a rous sarcoma virus (RSV) promoter.
Plasmid DNA (10 mg) was mixed with 30 ml of Fugene
(Roche) in 1 ml of serum free media for 15 minutes and then
added to the HSC culture that was maintained in 4 ml of
fresh M199 media containing 10% FBS. The transfection
media were removed 24 hours later and replaced with M199
media containing 10% FBS after the cultures were washed
three times with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) to remove
any residual Fugene reagent. The culture was subsequently
passaged seven times at which point the cells appeared
morphologically distinct from normal passaged cells and
were also more proliferative. The LX-1 cell line was
established from an individual clone from the primary T
antigen immortalised cultures. The LX-2 cell line was
established by selecting for a subline of the LX-1 cells that
was able to grow under reduced serum conditions (1% FBS).
A single clone from the outgrowth was expanded and
designated LX-2. The LX-2 cell line was cultured in DMEM
with only 2% FBS. The LX-1 cell line was cultured in DMEM
with 10% FBS.
To determine the transfection efficiency of LX-2 cells,
2.5 mg of a plasmid expressing enhanced green fluorescent
protein pEGFP-C2 (Clontech, Palo Alto, California, USA) was
mixed with 7.5 ml of Fugene in 0.25 ml serum free media for
15 minutes. This mixture was added to LX-2 cells cultured on
six well dishes with 2 ml DMEM containing 2% FBS. Cells
were visualised with an inverted microscope for bright field
and green fluorescence images
Immunocytochemistry
Cells were plated on glass coverslips (Fisher Scientific) in
12 well culture dishes and grown to approximately 50%
confluence for three days to promote the adherence of cells.
Cells were then washed twice with cold serum free media
(DMEM) and then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for
10 minutes. After fixation, cells were washed twice with PBS
and then permeabilised with PBS containing 0.1% Triton
X-100 for 15 minutes. They were next washed twice with PBS
and incubated with blocking solution (5% BSA in PBS) for
30 minutes. Primary antibodies (diluted 1:100 in blocking
solution) were incubated with the cells for one hour. After
three washes with PBST (0.2% Tween 20 in PBS), cells were
incubated with fluorescein labelled antimouse IgG (Vector
Laboratories; diluted 1:200 in blocking buffer) for one hour.
Cells were washed three times with PBST and then stained
with DAPI (Molecular Probes; 1:5000 in PBS) for one minute,
washed three times with PBST and then twice with PBS. Cells
were viewed with a Nikon Eclipse E600 fluorescence
microscope.
Protein analysis
HSCs and LX-1 cells were cultured in DMEM/10% FBS. LX-2
cells were cultured in DMEM/2% FBS. Cells grown in 10 cm
dishes were washed three times with cold PBS and harvested
in 0.4 ml of cold lysis buffer (20 mM Tris 7.4, 150 mM NaCl,
1% TX-100) with protease inhibitors (Complete, EDTA free;
Roche) sonicated, and centrifuged. The supernatant was
measured for protein concentration (DC Protein Assay;
Biorad, Hercules, California, USA). Samples were adjusted
to 16Laemmli loading buffer and 30 mg of the samples were
subjected to 10% sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis and then transferred to nitrocellulose.
Membranes were blocked and washed in TBS Tween buffer
and then developed with Western Lightning Plus (Perkin
Elmer, Boston, Massachusetts, USA).
For the detection of bPDGF-R, lysates were first immuno￾precipitated with a monoclonal antibody for bPDGF-R prior
to western blotting. For immunoprecipitation, cells from a
10 cm dish were harvested with 1 ml of cold lysis buffer.
Cleared lysates were incubated with antibody and protein G
sepharose (UltraLink; Pierce, Rockford, Illinois, USA) over￾night at 4˚C. After washing three times with lysis buffer, the
resin was eluted by resuspension in 16 Laemmli loading
buffer and boiling for 10 minutes. To determine the
gelatinase (MMP-2) activity secreted by LX-2 cells, gelatin
zymography was performed as previously described.8
Comparative quantitative real time RT-PCR
HSCs, LX-1 and LX-2 cells were plated in 60 mm diameter
dishes and cultured to 70% confluence. Cells were serum
starved and supplemented with 0.2% BSA for 48 hours prior
to TGF-b1 treatment (2.5 ng/ml for 20 hours). LX-1 cells
were additionally supplemented with 0.5% FBS. Control cells
were also serum starved. Total RNA was extracted with
TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California, USA)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, cells
were lysed with the reagent, chloroform was added, and
cellular RNA was precipitated by isopropyl alcohol. After
washing with 75% ethanol, the RNA pellet was dissolved in
nuclease free water.
Total RNA was reverse transcribed to complementary DNA
(cDNA) using the Reverse Transcription System (Promega,
Madison, Wisconsin, USA). RNA (1 mg) in 7.7 ml of nuclease
free water was added to 2.5 ml of 106 reverse transcriptase
buffer, 10 ml of 25 mM MgCl2, 2.5 ml of 10 mM dNTP, 1.0 ml
of random primer, 0.5 ml of RNase inhibitor, and 0.8 ml of
AMV reverse transcriptase in a total volume of 25 ml. The
reaction was performed for 10 minutes at 25˚C (annealing),
60 minutes at 42˚C (cDNA synthesis), and five minutes at
95˚C (enzyme denaturation).
Comparative quantitative real time polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) was performed with an ABI Prism 7700
Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City,
California, USA). cDNA (1 ml) was used in each PCR reaction.
The housekeeping gene b-actin was used as a reference gene

for normalisation and H2O was used as a negative control.
The primer pairs (sense/antisense) for a1(I) procollagen were
59-AAC ATG ACC AAA AAC CAA AAG TG-39 and 59-CAT TGT
TTC CTG TGT CTT CTG G-39; for HSP47: 59-ATG AGA AAT
TCC ACC ACA AGA TG-39 and 59GAT CTT CAG CTG CTC TTT
GGT TA-39; and for b-actin: 59-GAT GAG ATT GGC ATG GCT
TT-39 and 59-GAG AAG TGG GGT GGC TT-39. The PCR
reaction was catalysed by Platinum Taq polymerase
(Invitrogen) while SYBR Green I DNA binding dye
(Molecular Probes) generated the fluorescence signals during
each of the 40 cycles, in proportion to the quantities of double
stranded DNA (denaturation 15 seconds at 95˚C; annealing
15 seconds at 56˚C; and extension 40 seconds at 72˚C).
Analysis of the PCR products by agarose gel electrophoresis
confirmed the specificity of the PCR reaction and the
homogeneity of the DNA products.
Cell proliferation assay
LX-2 cells were assayed for their proliferative response to BB￾PDGF stimulation in serum free conditions by [3
H] thymi￾dine incorporation, as previously described.9
Analysis of retinoid biology
Retinol uptake and processing by LX-1 and LX-2 cells
Following plating and overnight incubation, cells were
treated with two different concentrations (2 mM and
10 mM) of retinol for 24 hours in the dark. For this purpose,
a concentrated stock solution of retinol was diluted in a small
volume of ethanol (,1% of the aqueous volume), added to
the media with 300 mM palmitic acid to aid esterification,
and then vigorously mixed. Following incubation, media
from triplicate cultures were removed and cells scraped into
2 ml of ice cold PBS. Samples were then stored at 220˚C prior
to analysis. Control cells were cultured in medium with
ethanol vehicle.
HPLC analyses of retinol and retinyl esters
Retinol and retinyl esters were analysed by reversed
phase high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC), as
described by Yamada and colleagues,10 using a Waters 510
HPLC pump (Waters Associates, Milford, Massachusetts,
USA) operating at a flow of 1.8 ml/min, an Ultrasphere C18
column (5 mm; 4.6 mm625 cm) (Beckman Instruments,
Fullerton, California, USA), and a Waters 996 Photodiode￾array detector. Retinol and retinyl esters were monitored at
325 nm and quantified using standard curves relating the
known mass to mass ratio of retinol or retinyl esters to that of
internal standard retinyl acetate. This HPLC method allows
for detection and quantitation of different retinyl esters,
including retinyl palmitate, oleate, stearate, linoleate, and
myristate.
Microarray analyses
RNA preparation
RNA was extracted from HSC and LX cells grown to
80% confluence in DMEM containing 10% FBS using
Qiagen (Valencia, California, USA) RNeasy column with
on-column DNase treatment. RNA was eluted in RNase-free
water, and A260/A280 ratios were .2.0. The integrity of
the total RNA was verified by denaturing agarose gel
electrophoresis (NorthernMax-Gly; Ambion, Austin Texas,
USA).
Biotin labelled cRNA (target) preparation
For cDNA synthesis, 5 mg of total RNA were mixed with a T7
primer and Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen)
and incubated at 42˚C for one hour. The second strand of
cDNA was generated by mixing the first strand with
Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I and RNase H, and
incubating at 16˚C for two hours. The double stranded
cDNA was purified by the QIAquick kit (Qiagen), according
to the manufacturer’s protocol. Purified cDNA was eluted
in 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, and dried in a Speed-Vac. For
cRNA synthesis, purified cDNA was incubated with biotin
labelled 11-UTP and 11-CTP in an overnight in vitro trans￾cription reaction at 37˚C. RNA was purified and recovered
by Rneasy column purification (Qiagen) following the
manufacturer’s protocol. RNA was eluted in RNase free
water and quantified by UV spectrophotometry at 260 nm.
The size distribution of the biotin labelled cRNA was verified
on a Bioanalyzer (Agilent, Foster City, California, USA), and
ranged from 500 to 2000 nucleotides in length (data not
shown). The average yield of cRNA was approximately
100 mg per reaction. Biotin labelled cRNA was fragmented
by heating at 94˚C for 20 minutes in the presence of magne￾sium, yielding fragments approximately 50–200 nucleotides
in length.
Hybridisation and processing
Fragmented biotin labelled cRNA (10 mg) was mixed with
the CodeLink hybridisation buffer (260 ml total volume) and
injected into replicate (2) CodeLink UniSet Human I
bioarrays. Arrays were loaded onto a tray and hybridised
overnight at 37˚C shaking at 300 RPM in an Innova
incubator. Arrays were rinsed individually and then placed
in a stringency wash for one hour. Next, each slide was
incubated in 3.4 ml of streptavidin-Alexa 647 (Molecular
Probes) working solution for 30 minutes, after which the
slides were washed four times in 240 ml of TNT buffer. For
the final washes, slides were rinsed twice in 240 ml of
reagent grade water. The slides were then dried with an N2
gas stream.
Data collection and image analysis
Spot detection was performed with the GenePix Series A
scanner (Axon Instruments, Foster City, California, USA)
and spot quantitation was performed using the CodeLink
software. Key quantitation parameters are briefly described
here: local background subtraction is carried out on
individual spot intensities, followed by a scaling of each
array individually based on the overall array intensity. After
median normalisation, the negative control threshold is
calculated using a set of negative control probes, as described
previously.11 12
Statistical analysis
The normalised dataset was filtered to exclude clones with
intensities below the negative threshold value for each array.
Array experiments for each cell line were then further filtered
to exclude clones that were differentially expressed greater
than 1.5-fold between the two technical replicates. Intensities
were averaged across technical replicates for each clone, and
the SNOMAD (Standardisation and NOrmalisation of
MicroArray Data) gene expression data analysis tool (avail￾able at http://pevsnerlab.kennedykrieger.org/snomadinput.
html) was used to standardise the array data for pairs of
cell lines in order to render them more comparable. Briefly,
the datasets were log transformed and the R ‘‘lowess’’
function was used to correct for mean local variance. Finally,
z scores (that is, standard deviation units relative to the
amount of variance in the log values at particular expression
levels) were calculated for each clone.13 Clones with z
scores greater than 5 or less than 25 and with expression
ratios greater than fivefold were considered differentially
expressed. Several differentially expressed clones were
validated using comparative quantitative reverse transcrip￾tion (RT)-PCR.

RESULTS
Isolation and immortalisation of human hepatic
stellate cells
HSCs were obtained from a ,15 g wedge of normal liver
tissue by collagenase/pronase treatment followed by fraction￾ation on a Nycodenz density gradient to isolate the bouyant
and lipid rich stellate cells, as described in the methods
section. The primary culture isolate was plated onto an
uncoated plastic dish, trypsinised after three days, and
subcultured. These cells were passaged three more times in
order to remove potential contaminating hepatocytes, endo￾thelial cells, and Kupffer cells, which typically do not survive
trypsinisation and subculturing. These passage 4 HSCs were
then examined by immunocytochemistry for a-SMA, a
marker for activated HSCs, to assess their purity. All cells
were positive for a-SMA whereas there was no immuno￾staining for CD68 or factor VIII related antigen, which are
markers for Kupffer and endothelial cells, respectively.
Positive control immunostaining for CD68 and factor VIII
related antigen in isolated Kupffer cells and endothelial cells
confirmed the specificity of these markers (data not shown).
For immortalisation, a culture of the passage 4 cells was
transfected with the plasmid pRSV-Tag that expresses the
SV40 large T antigen under the control of a rous sarcoma
virus promoter. To select for the immortalised cells, we took
into account that primary passaged HSCs are viable for only a
limited number of passages, and furthermore that they
replicate slowly with a doubling time of approximately seven
days. We further assumed that the immortalised cells would
grow more rapidly than the primary passaged HSCs from
which they derived as the SV40 large T antigen is capable of
inhibiting G1 cell cycle growth arrest (reviewed by Ali and
DeCaprio14). The T antigen transfected culture was subcul￾tured at a 1:10 dilution for several passages with the expec￾tation that immortalised cells would eventually dominate the
culture population. After seven rounds of passaging, there
was a noticeable morphological change in the culture. The
cells were smaller in size, appearing less outstretched, and
the proliferation rate markedly increased, with a culture
doubling time of only 24 hours. By limiting dilution, single
cell clones were isolated and amplified. One clone designated
LX-1 was expanded for further investigation.
Another immortalised HSC cell line designated LX-2 was
established by applying the selection pressure of growing a
subset of early passaged LX-1 cells in reduced serum (1%
FBS). The rationale was to establish a cell line that remained
viable in the absence of serum growth factor support,
characteristic of primary HSCs. Four separate pools of early
passage LX-1 cells were grown in reduced serum, and nearly
all of the cells detached from the culture dishes after a single
day. Three days later, the remaining cells in the culture were
reincubated in growth factor rich media (10% fetal bovine
serum) for several weeks until they reached confluence, and
were then subjected to growth in reduced serum again. After
four sequential rounds of this selection procedure, we
identified in one out of four original pools a culture of cells
which grew stably in 1% FBS. These cells appeared
morphologically homogenous and proliferated slowly regard￾less of the serum concentration, with a culture doubling time
of approximately 3–4 days. The LX-2 cell line has since been
maintained and expanded in low serum media for up to 50
passages.
To determine if the cell lines expressed the SV40 large T
antigen, they were analysed by immunocytochemistry (fig 1).
SV40 large T antigen was mostly localised in the nucleus of
the LX-1 cells, whereas the LX-2 cells were negative,
indicating the loss of T antigen expression (fig 1). Western
analysis confirmed this finding (data not shown). As a
control, cells were costained with DAPI to identify the nuclei
(fig 1).
Figure 1 Expression of SV40 large T antigen (TAg) in the LX-1 cell line. LX cells were subjected to immunocytochemical analysis (see methods). The
SV40 large T antigen was detected in the nucleus of LX-1 cells but not in LX-2 cells. Cells were costained with DAPI to identify nuclei.

Expression of intermediate filaments
Cell lines were also examined by immunocytochemistry for
expression of the intermediate filament proteins a-SMA,
vimentin, and GFAP, which are typically expressed in HSCs
(fig 2). Both LX-1 and LX-2 cells expressed a-SMA, a marker
for activated HSCs. Vimentin, a marker for cell types of
mesenchymal origin, and GFAP, a marker of a subpopulation
of stellate cells, were present in both cell lines in a
cytoskeletal network. Western analysis also confirmed
expression of these proteins (data not shown).
Expression of receptors: PDGF-R, OB-RL , and DDR2
The most potent mitogen towards activated HSCs is PDGF
which is a dimer of two polypeptide chains, the A and B
chains. Of the three possible dimeric forms (AA, AB, and BB),
BB-PDGF, is most potent in stimulating HSC proliferation
and migration, consistent with predominant expression of
the PDGF receptor b subunit, which responds preferentially
to PDGF B chain.15 Both LX cell lines expressed the bPDGF-R
subunit, which comigrated with the b subunit of the PDGF
receptor expressed by primary human HSCs and with the
higher molecular weight form expressed in NIH3T3 cells
(fig 3). This finding suggests that the cell lines represent
activated HSCs since the PDGF-R b subunit is not expressed
in quiescent cells.9 15 Although both cell lines expressed
bPDGF-R, stimulation with BB-PDGF ligand increased
proliferation of only LX-2 (fig 3) but not LX-1 in serum free
medium (data not shown), as determined by 3
H-thymidine
incorporation.
In addition to the PDGF receptor, we identified two other
receptors, DDR2 and Ob-RL, in both LX lines (fig 4). DDR2 is
a receptor tyrosine that we previously documented in rat
stellate cells.6 16 Human HSCs express DDR2, as determined
by western blot (fig 4). The DDR2 protein appeared as a
doublet from both cell lines whereas primary HSCs primarily
expressed the higher molecular weight species only. The
lower band may represent a form of the receptor that is not
tyrosine phosphorylated, as we have previously documented
in rat HSCs.6 16
Western blot also demonstrated expression of an approxi￾mately 200 kDa Ob-RL protein in human HSCs and in the cell
lines (fig 4). Signalling through Ob-RL, the long and
signalling competent isoform of the leptin receptor, enhances
the fibrogenic response of rodent HSCs.17–19 Moreover, a
recent study from our laboratory has documented expression
of Ob-RL protein in rat HSCs.19
Matrix remodelling proteins: MMP-2, MT1-MMP,
TIMP-1, and TIMP-2
Expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and their
tissue inhibitors (TIMPs) are increased in liver fibrosis and
contribute to both the progression and regression of fibrosis.20

MMP-2 (also known as gelatinase A) is expressed and
secreted by HSCs as they become activated in culture.21
MMP-2 proteinase activity is regulated at the cell surface
and involves the formation of a tri-molecular complex
that associates pro-MMP2 with MT1-MMP (also known as
MMP-14) and TIMP-2. All three components of this complex
are expressed by activated HSCs.
We examined LX-1 and LX-2 cell lines for expression of
this tri-molecular protein complex which regulates MMP-2
activity. Western analysis of whole cell lysates demonstrated
all three components (figs 4, 5). However, for MMP-2, both
the pro- and active forms were both detected in primary HSCs
whereas mostly the pro-MMP2 form was detected in both LX
cell lines. Secretion of MMP-2 by LX-2 cells was also
evaluated but could not be assessed in LX-1 cells as they
underwent rapid cell death in the serum free conditions
required to determine MMP-2 secretion (serum contains
large amounts of MMP-2). LX-2 cultures were serum starved
for 16 hours and the harvested conditioned media were
subjected to gelatin zymography. This method of analysis can
detect gelatinase activity, even of proenzymes, due to sodium
dodecyl sulphate induced protein conformational changes
that reveal latent activities. Gelatinase activity was detected
which corresponds to the higher molecular weight form (pro￾MMP-2) detected by western blot (fig 5).
Expression of TIMP-1 protein, which inhibits collagen
degradation, was also evaluated. Both TIMP-1 and TIMP-2
expression increase dramatically as HSCs become activated in
culture. In contrast with LX-1 and primary HSCs, LX-2 cells
expressed only a small amount of TIMP-1 protein (fig 4).
However, we only examined TIMP expression in cell lysates,
and as TIMPs are usually secreted, there may be a
considerable amount in the culture media. For TIMP-2, its
detection in cell lysates may be due to its association with
MT1-MMP at the cell surface. It is unclear why TIMP-1 is
abundant in HSC and LX-1 cell lysates, but not in those of
LX-2 cells (fig 4). However, TIMP-1 production in LX-2 was
stimulated in response to leptin, a profibrogenic hormone in
the liver.22
Expression of a1(I) procollagen and HSP47 mRNA
To evaluate the ability of the cell lines to produce fibrillar type
I collagen that is associated with fibrosis, comparative
quantitative real time RT-PCR was performed for a1(I)
procollagen and HSP47 mRNAs. HSP47 is a collagen specific
chaperone protein that is required for collagen biosynthesis
and is involved in procollagen processing, maturation, and
secretion.23 HSP47 mRNA is expressed in human HSCs and in
the LX-1 and LX-2 cell lines, with 50% greater expression in
LX-1 than LX-2. LX cells also expressed much more HSP47
mRNA than the hepatoma cell lines Huh7 and HepG2, which
were used as a negative control (fig 6). Expression of a1(I)
procollagen paralleled the level of HSP47 expression across
primary HSCs and LX cell lines (fig 6).
TGF-b1 stimulates a(1)I procollagen mRNA in LX cell
lines
TGF-b1 is a potent profibrogenic cytokine of primary HSCs
that stimulates expression of a(1)I procollagen mRNA. TGF￾b1 treatment of LX-1 and LX-2 cells increased expression of
a1(I) procollagen mRNA by 3–4-fold, as assessed by
comparative real time RT-PCR (fig 7).

LX-2 cells are highly transfectable
A major technical limitation to studying cultured stellate cells
has been their consistently very low transfection efficiency,
typically less than 1%. This has imposed significant limita￾tions in the study of this cell type, as molecular genetic
manipulation by ectopic overexpression of genes (and
dominant negatives thereof) could not be performed. Viral
infection of HSCs has been reported24 25 but is time consum￾ing. In contrast, LX-2 cells displayed a relatively high
transfection efficiency of .30% using a commercial reagent,
Fugene (fig 8). LX-1 and primary human HSCs displayed
,1% efficiency with Fugene (data not shown).
LX-1 and LX-2 cell lines metabolise retinoids
LX-1 and LX-2 stellate cells were analysed for their ability to
take up and esterify retinol (2 mM and 10 mM). In untreated
cells, no retinyl esters and only very low levels of retinol could
be detected. (Concentration of retinol in medium containing
10% FBS is approximately 0.1 mM, which is well below the
physiological concentration of retinol (2 mM).) As depicted in
fig 9, both retinol and retinyl esters accumulated in LX-1 and
LX-2 stellate cells on retinol incubation, which was greater at
higher concentrations of added retinol. Both cell lines
accumulated retinol and converted it to retinyl ester to a
similar extent. Retinyl esters were present only intracellularly
and none could be detected in the medium. Thus retinoid
metabolism by LX-1 and LX-2 lines is similar to that reported
in rat liver stellate cells.26
Gene expression analysis of LX-1 and LX-2 cell lines
by microarray compared with primary HSCs
To achieve a more global characterisation of gene expression
by LX-1 and LX-2, we compared their mRNA profiles to
primary HSCs by microarray analysis using Amersham
Codelink to scan approximately 10 000 gene probes (clones).
Of the 2211 clones detected with expression above negative
thresholds for both LX-1 and primary HSCs, 36 were
differentially expressed (98.4% similarly expressed), and of
the 2240 clones detected with expression above negative

thresholds for both LX-2 and primary HSCs, 28 were
differentially expressed (98.7% similarly expressed). Of the
2692 clones expressed above negative thresholds for both
LX-1 and LX-2 cell lines, 18 were differentially expressed
(99.3% similarly expressed). Therefore, there were even fewer
differentially expressed genes between the two LX cell lines.
Eighteen genes were similarly differentially expressed in
both LX-1 and LX-2 when compared with primary HSCs
(tables 1–3). Both LX-1 and LX-2 cell lines showed reduced
expression of p21, as might be expected given their
immortalised phenotype, which was confirmed by real time
PCR (not shown). Also consistent with an immortalised
phenotype is the increased expression of CDC2, thymidine
kinase 1, TGF-bI induced 68 kDa protein, CSE1L (chromo￾some segregation 1-like), and survivin, all of which have
been shown to either promote proliferation or are antiapop￾totic. Differential expression of these genes is not simply a
consequence of T antigen overexpression as LX-2 cells do not
express T antigen. Both LX cell lines also had reduced
expression of LTBP2 (latent TGF-b binding protein 2) and
ITGA7 (integrin alpha 7).
Genes that are specifically differentially expressed in LX-1
compared with primary HSCs include PIG11 (p53 induced
gene 11), CTGF (connective tissue growth factor), and
decorin (tables 1–3). Reduced expression of PIG11 in LX-1
is consistent with inactivation of p53 by T antigen. Genes that
are specifically differentially expressed in LX-2 cells include
the oxytocin receptor and follistatin-like 1.
Increasing evidence points to a neuronal phenotype of
hepatic stellate cells.27 Indeed, a large number of neuronal
related genes were expressed in primary human stellate cells
as well as in LX-1 and LX-2 cells (table 4).
DISCUSSION
We established two human hepatic stellate cell lines and
characterised their global gene expression by microarray.
These cell lines provide important tools to study mechanisms
of hepatic fibrogenesis and the testing of antifibrotic
compounds. LX-1 cells express SV40 large T antigen whereas
LX-2 cells are immortalised without sustained T antigen;
both are stable for at least 50 passages thus far. The
phenotype of both LX lines is most similar to that of
‘‘activated’’ cells in vivo. For example, expression of GFAP by

LX lines is more typical of chronic liver disease in which both
HSCs and portal myofibroblasts express this intermediate
filament28 whereas in normal liver the majority of human
HSCs are not immunoreactive for this intermediate fila￾ment.29 In addition to GFAP, LX cells express the receptors
bPDGF-R, DDR2, and Ob-RL that are expressed in activated
HSCs but not in quiescent cells. Despite this activated
phenotype, LX-1 and LX-2 lines can be quiesced by growth
in matrigel (not shown) or low serum30 which is similar to
results that we have reported for an immortalised rat stellate
cell line HSC-T6.15
Both cell lines express the b subunit of the PDGF receptor
but only the LX-2 cells are responsive to BB-PDGF induced
proliferation. One potential explanation for this insensitivity
in LX-1 is that the cells are already maximally stimulated by
either serum derived or autocrine PDGF. Similar to primary
activated HSCs, LX-2 cells remain viable in serum free
medium with 0.2% BSA in contrast with LX-1 cells. LX-1 and
LX-2 cells are responsive to TGF-b1, a major fibrogenic
cytokine in liver disease. TGF-b1 is increased in animal
models of liver fibrosis and in patients with chronic liver
disease.31 32
HSCs have been characterised by their expression of
specific marker genes, yet in vivo there is considerable
heterogeneity and plasticity of their phenotype.28 29 33–35 Such
heterogeneous patterns of expression are likely to reflect local
influences of the microenvironment that include extracellular
matrix, soluble autocrine and paracrine factors, and cell-cell
communication.
Established cell lines will, by definition, differ to some
extent in their molecular phenotype from cultured primary
cells as they are immortal. Of the three other human stellate
cell lines (besides LX-1 and LX-2) described to date, only the
hTERT-HSC cell line is derived from density gradient purified
HSCs, similar to the LX lines. The hTERT-HSC cell line was
developed by immortalisation with retroviral expression of
human telomerase.5 Interestingly, like LX cells, the hTERT￾HSC cell line expresses GFAP which is also expressed by a
majority but not all activated human HSCs in vivo. The two
other human stellate cell lines represent spontaneous out￾growths from diseased livers: the LI90 cell line was derived
from an outgrowth of a hepatic mesenchymal tumour36 and
the GREF-X cell line was obtained by spontaneous immorta￾lisation of cultured liver myofibroblasts from a cirrhotic liver
explant outgrowth.37 Importantly, of all human stellate cell
lines generated to date, only the LX-2 cell line remains viable
in the absence of serum. In addition to validating fibrogenic
pathways in LX-1 and LX-2 cells, we have also demonstrated
that the LX cell lines express the components of a matrix
degrading complex. Specifically, they express the gelatinase A
matrix remodelling complex, comprised of pro-MMP-2, MT1-
MMP, and TIMP-2. Moreover, LX-2 cells secrete pro-MMP2,
making them an important potential tool for exploring
matrix degradative pathways in a human cell model.
Recently, LX-2 cells were shown to be migratory due to
increased MMP-2 activity from cytokine stimulation.38
Increasing evidence also links matrix degradation directly
to apoptosis in stellate cells,39 and the unique capacity of LX-2
cells to withstand serum deprivation not only provides a
means to assay MMP-2 by zymography without the
confounding effects of serum but also to explore pathways
of apoptosis. Recently, LX-2 cells were shown to be capable of
undergoing TRAIL mediated apoptosis, as do primary HSCs.30
A unique advantage of LX-2 cells is their relative high
transfectability, with efficiencies of transfection of ,30%
using commercial reagents (Fugene), compared with effic￾iencies of less than 1% for LX-1 cells and all other stellate cell
culture systems reported to date.
The microarray analysis also unearthed potential thera￾peutic targets described for other pathological conditions,
and also confirmed expression of several neuronal genes in
this cell type. For example, progranulin (also called granulin
or PC derived growth factor) was expressed equally in the cell
lines and primary HSCs, and is a novel growth factor induced
in cutaneous wound healing.40 Both LX-1 and LX-2 lines
display increased expression of survivin. This molecule
belongs to a family of genes known as inhibitors of apoptosis,
and has also been implicated in the control of mitosis and
regulation of smooth muscle cell biology in vascular
injury.41 42 Expression of follistatin-like 1 (FSTL1, FRP,
TSC-36) by stellate cells is intriguing as the protein that it
shares likeness to (follistatin) has been shown to enhance
liver regeneration and also has antifibrotic effects on
pancreatic stellate cells.43–45
Current antifibrotic drug development focuses on target
gene identification using array technologies, and validation
of lead compounds using high throughput analysis in cell
based assays. Human rather than rodent cells are absolutely
essential for such approaches, and the availability of cell lines
that faithfully maintain the in vivo phenotype are a vital
component. The LX-1 and LX-2 lines represent such reagents,
and the LX-2 line in particular, with its high transfectability
and ability to withstand serum free conditions, provide
important new tools in the elucidation of stellate cell biology
and the discovery of antifibrotic therapies.
