Abstract
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is characterized by inflammation, injury and fibrosis. Dysregulated innate immune
responses mediated by macrophages play critical roles in progressive renal injury. The differentiation and
polarization of macrophages into pro-inflammatory ‘M1’ and anti-inflammatory ‘M2’ states represent the two
extreme maturation programs of macrophages during tissue injury. However, the effects of macrophage
polarization on the pathogenesis of CKD are not fully understood. In this review, we discuss the innate immune
mechanisms underlying macrophage polarization and the role of macrophage polarization in the initiation,
progression, resolution and recurrence of CKD. Macrophage activation and polarization are initiated through
recognition of conserved endogenous and exogenous molecular motifs by pattern recognition receptors, chiefly,
Toll-like receptors (TLRs), which are located on the cell surface and in endosomes, and NLR inflammasomes, which
are positioned in the cytosol. Recent data suggest that genetic variants of the innate immune molecule
apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1) that are associated with increased CKD prevalence in people of African descent, mediate
an atypical M1 macrophage polarization. Manipulation of macrophage polarization may offer novel strategies to
address dysregulated immunometabolism and may provide a complementary approach along with current
podocentric treatment for glomerular diseases.

Background
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) bears a major global
health burden, with an estimated prevalence of 8 to 16%
of the population worldwide [1, 2]. CKD is manifested
by chronic inflammation, with sustained, unsuccessful
injury-repair cycles and subsequent fibrosis [3] and these
processes involve both protective and pathogenic roles
of macrophages [3].
Macrophages are a central component of the innate
immune system, which is the first line of defense against
endogenous pathogens (defined as pathogens normally
present in some tissue compartment) and exogenous
pathogens (defined as pathogens not present in a healthy
host). Innate responses involve non-specific immune
functions (e.g., cytokine release) that are induced upon
detection of pathogen-associated molecular patterns
(PAMPs [e.g., bacterial lipopolysaccharide]) and host￾derived damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs
[e.g., mitochondrial DNA]) by pattern recognition recep￾tors (PRRs), [4] of which the best studied in association
with CKD are membrane-bound Toll-like receptors

domain (NOD)-like receptors (NLRs).
Macrophages may originate from erythro-myeloid pro￾genitors, hematopoietic stem cells or circulating mono￾cytes [5] and display diverse phenotypes in response to
the distinct tissue microenvironments in which they res￾ide. M1 and M2 macrophage states have been intro￾duced to describe two extremes of this diversity, which
historically have been described as classically activated
(M1) and alternatively activated (M2) macrophages, re￾spectively [6]. Experimentally, M1 macrophages are typ￾ically induced by exposure to interferon-γ and/or
lipopolysaccharide and are considered pro-inflammatory,
while M2 macrophages are induced by interleukins (IL)
like IL-4, IL-13, and IL-33, and are considered anti￾inflammatory [7, 8], which can be further subcategorized
into three subgroups: M2a macrophages are induced by
IL-4 and/or IL-13, induce anti-inflammatory, wound
healing and tissue fibrosis; M2b macrophages are in￾duced by immune complexes in combination of LPS
and/or IL-1R ligands, function in immunoregulation;
M2c macrophages are induced by IL-10, transforming
growth factor (TGF)-β or glucocorticoids, contribute to
immunosuppression, matrix deposition and tissue re￾modeling [7, 8]. As these pure in vitro stimulation con￾ditions are somewhat artificial and reductionist, it is
generally recognized that the M1 and M2/M2 subset
states are largely idealized and that macrophage
polarization in vivo is much more complex, character￾ized by a continuum of functional phenotypes. Recently,
stimulus-specific nomenclature has been proposed for
macrophage states, for example, listing the stimulus in
brackets such as M [interferon-γ], M [IL-4], or M [IL￾Ic], as has specification of macrophage states by cell sur￾face markers, such as CD11b+
Ly6Chigh, CD14highC￾D16low, CD206−
CD68+
, and CD206+
CD68+ [9, 10].
Although it is an over-simplification this review will use
the ‘M1’ and ‘M2’ dichotomy terminology, in most cases,
to align with the existing literature and distinct Th1 and
Th2 adaptive immune system of which macrophages is
associated.

Macrophage polarization and chronic kidney diseases
Chronic inflammation plays a leading role in the pro￾gression of CKD. Macrophages recognize exogenous
PAMPs and/or DAMPs released from damaged tissue
and polarize into an M1 phenotype, leading to the re￾lease of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and re￾active oxygen species (ROS), and consequent bystander
kidney tissue damage [8]. The renal inflammation and
injury subsequently initiate healing processes and mac￾rophages repolarize to an M2 phenotype, releasing anti￾inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, proangiogenic
mediators, and growth factors. If renal inflammation and
injury cannot be resolved, resulting in chronic inflamma￾tion, [7, 8] the recurring repair and wounding is en￾hanced [11], with progressive decline of renal function
and development of tissue fibrosis (Fig. 1).
M1 macrophages are a characteristic feature of chronic
inflammation in CKD. These cells typically display high
cell surface expression of CD16, CD32, CD80, CD86,
major histocompatibility complex class (MHC) II and
IL-1 receptor (IL-1R), production of pro-inflammatory
cytokines such as IL-1, IL-6, IL-12, and IL-23, and high
expression of oxidative and tissue-remodeling proteins
such as inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), matrix
metalloproteinase and macrophage-inducible C-type lec￾tin [7]. Plasma pro-inflammatory biomarkers such as
TNF were increased in CKD patients in the Chronic
Renal Insufficiency Cohort study [12].
However, M2 macrophages are also a major feature of
chronic renal inflammation especially during the repair
phase, contributing to resolution of inflammation and
tissue repair [8]. During the repair phase, M2 macro￾phages can be switched from M1 macrophages, or ori￾ginate from in situ proliferation and differentiation from
infiltrating monocytes [7, 8, 13]. M2 macrophages func￾tion in cell- and tissue- repair and wound healing
through antagonizing M1 macrophage function, secret￾ing anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-10, IL-22,
TGF-β, reducing neutrophil infiltration and suppressing
inflammation through Fizz1, Arg1, SOCS1, and SOCS3,
and performing clearance of debris and dead cells [8]. A
role for M2 macrophages in repair of renal injury has
been observed in both in vitro and in vivo experiments;
for example, M2 polarization prevents renal injury in the
murine model of adriamycin nephropathy [8], and pro￾tects the kidney against ischemia-reperfusion injury in
Netrin-1 transgenic mice [14].
Evidence from animal models and human CKD pa￾tients reveals that M2 rather than M1 macrophages are
correlated with progression of fibrosis [7]; however, it is
controversial whether M2 macrophages promote or at￾tenuate fibrosis. In the murine unilateral ureteral ob￾struction (UUO) model, depletion of M2 macrophages
reduces renal fibrosis, and adoptive transfer of M2 mac￾rophages promotes accumulation of myofibroblasts ex￾pressing smooth muscle α-actin [15] due to secretion of
profibrotic factors like TGF-β, galectin-3, and FGF [16].
In the murine anti-glomerular basement membrane
model, depletion of M2 macrophages significantly re￾duced glomerular and interstitial collagen IV deposition,
which was accompanied by a reduction in periglomeru￾lar smooth muscle α-actin-positive cells [13]. The num￾ber of M2 macrophages correlates with the degree of
renal fibrosis in IgA nephropathy [17] and diabetic ne￾phropathy [18]. However, in contrast to their promotion
Lee et al. BMC Nephrology (2020) 21:270 Page 2 of 13

of fibrosis, M2 macrophages may promote resolution of
renal fibrosis through fibrolytic roles by producing
matrix metalloproteinases and degradation of extracellu￾lar matrix in the fibrotic kidney [11].
Toll-like receptors in macrophage polarization
TLRs are the best-studied macrophage PRRs in CKD.
TLR molecules are transmembrane receptors that func￾tion either at the cell surface or in intracellular
membranes (i.e., endosomes). TLR1–9 are expressed in
both humans and mice, while TLR10 is non-functional
in mice and TLR11-13 are not expressed in humans
[19]. TLR1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 10 are expressed on the cell
surface, and TLR3, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13 are expressed intra￾cellularly [20]. The cellular expression, ligands, signaling
and immune response of TLRs are summarized in
Table 1 [19–21]. TLRs recognize both PAMPs and
DAMPs to shape inflammatory responses and renal
Fig. 1 Macrophage polarization in pathogenesis of CKD. Macrophages are activated by DAMPs, PAMPs or other mediators, differentiated
and polarized into distinct phenotypes through activation of TLRs, NLRP3 inflammasomes and other receptors. Macrophages demonstrate
dramatically diverse phenotypes in inflammation, injury-repair cycles and fibrosis over time, depending on the nature of stimulator(s) in
the local environment, injury type, persistence, severity and reparative condition of the kidney. In the early stages of CKD, pro￾inflammatory phenotypes could be the major feature of macrophages. If the injury resolves, macrophages switch to an anti-inflammatory
phenotype. If the injury cannot be resolved, M1 macrophages remain and M2 macrophages are reduced and may revert to M1 at the
site. The products (e.g. cytokines, metabolites etc) released from activated macrophages can join with original stimulator(s) further
modulate macrophage function through genetic or epigenetic regulation. DAMP, damage-associated molecular pattern; ECM, extracellular

injury and fibrotic progression through macrophage
polarization in CKD.
Roles of TLRs in inflammation have been observed in
both animal models and CKD patients. Activation of
macrophage TLR2 induces a pro-inflammatory response
and pathogenesis of nephropathy in diabetic mice [22]
and inhibition of macrophage TLR2 signaling leads to
suppressed diabetic nephropathy [23]. TLR4 expression
is significantly higher in stage 3 and 4 CKD patients than
healthy controls and is positively correlated with serum
levels of TNF-α, IL-6 and MCP-1 in CKD patients [24].
Activation of TLR9 coincides with accumulation of M1
macrophages and increased expression of pro￾inflammatory cytokines in the renal interstitial compart￾ment [25]. Of interest, high density lipoprotein from
CKD patients activates TLR2 in macrophages, inducing
pro-inflammatory cytokines, but is deficient in inducing
protective cholesterol efflux [26, 27]. Expression of
TLR4 on macrophages and serum IL-6 concentrations
are increased during and post-haemodialysis compared
to the baseline levels in stage 3 and 4 CKD patients [28].
Taken together, this suggests that activation of TLRs on
macrophages not only initiates inflammatory responses
and M1 macrophage polarization but also that the
uremic environment induces high expression of TLRs,
further amplifying pro-inflammatory cytokine produc￾tion and inflammatory responses in CKD animal models
and patients. This increased inflammatory reaction could
be one of the major contributors to the high risk of
atherosclerosis observed in CKD patients.
The role of TLRs on macrophages in tissue injury is
better known in the context of liver wound healing. De￾ficiency of TLR4 protects against liver injury in various
animal models including bile duct ligation and experi￾mental alcoholic and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis; simi￾lar findings are also observed in mice deficient in CD14,
a TLR4-binding protein, and MyD88 and Trif, TLR4
adaptor molecules, together indicating a critical role for
TLR4 in liver injury [29]. A recent study has demon￾strated that TLR7 activation also plays important roles
in liver injury and progression of early alcoholic liver
disease through a Stat3-dependent mechanism [30]. Un￾like the liver, the kidney is rarely exposed to bacterial
PAMPs. However, levels of endogenous TLR ligands
(i.e., DAMPs) increase in the injured kidney. In the kid￾ney, TLR2 and TLR4 are important in the injury of
glomerulonephritis, such as lupus nephritis [19]. IL-1
receptor-associated kinase-M, a macrophage-specific
TLR inhibitor, improves resolution of kidney injury
through reduction of M1 macrophage and TNF-α pro￾duction [25]. In other contexts, such as bisphosphonate￾related osteonecrosis of the jaw, TLR4 inhibition en￾hances M2 and decreases M1 macrophage polarization,
leading to wound healing of the extraction socket [31],
and TLR2 activates more strongly in M2 than in M1
macrophages in rheumatoid arthritis patients [32]. TLR4
and other TLRs may thus play roles in the excessive de￾position of collagen and other extracellular matrix pro￾teins during the repeated and prolonged injury of kidney
tissue in CKD animal models and patients; we posit that
this warrants further investigation.
TLRs also contribute to renal fibrosis in chronic renal
injury. The crucial pro-fibrotic role of TLR4 has been re￾vealed by TLR4-deficient mice. TLR4-deficient mice ex￾hibit decreased matrix metalloproteinase activity and a
significant reduction in fibroblast accumulation and oxi￾dative stress in hypertensive kidneys [33]. Downregula￾tion of TLR4 and its downstream signaling shifts
macrophage polarization from an M1 towards an M2
phenotype and ameliorates renal interstitial fibrosis, glo￾merulosclerosis, and renal functional loss in the early
stages of UUO [34] and adriamycin nephropathy in rats
[35]. Mutation of TLR4 protects mice from development
of inflammation and renal injury including albuminuria,
glomerulosclerosis, and renal fibrosis after nephrectomy
with angiotensin II infusion, as revealed by C3HeJ TLR4
mutant mice [36]. Deficiency of MyD88, a common
adaptor molecule of TLRs, significantly reduces lesions
of the glomerular filtration barrier and collagen depos￾ition and leads to reduction of fibrosis after UUO [37].

NLRP3 inflammasomes in macrophage polarization
Like TLRs, Nod-like receptor (NLR) inflammasomes are
PRRs important in the macrophage polarization associ￾ated with pathogenesis of CKD [38]. The nucleotide￾binding domain, leucine-rich-containing family, pyrin
domain-containing-3 (NLRP3) inflammasome is the best
characterized member of the NLR inflammasome family.
Renal macrophages express all components of NLRP3
inflammasomes, which can sense PAMPs from patho￾gens or DAMPs released from injured renal tissue in￾cluding ROS, ATP, extracellular matrix components,
oxalate and cholesterol crystals, excess glucose, cera￾mides, amyloids, urate, and potassium efflux, although in
several of these cases, the responses are likely not via
direct interaction with NLRP3 [39, 40].
In macrophages, NLRP3 activation can be primed by
TLRs (step 1), which activates NF-κB or a non-NF-κB
pathway to produce pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18; step 2 in￾volves the oligomerization of NLRP3 with recruitment of
the adaptor molecule apoptosis-associated speck-like
protein containing a caspase recruitment domain (ASC)
and pro-caspase-1. Active caspase-1 or caspase-11 then
cleaves pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 to produce mature cy￾tokines IL-1β and IL-18 [41]. Both IL-1β and IL-18 are
among the most potent pro-inflammatory cytokines and
are important in M1 macrophage polarization [42, 43].
Deficiency of IL-1β attenuates progression of mouse
glomerulonephritis with less crescent formation [11], in￾dicating the importance of IL-1β in the pathogenesis of
CKD in mice. IL-18, an interferon-γ-inducing factor, is
important in lipopolysaccharide-induced macrophage
M1 polarization, [44] subsequent inflammation and pro￾gression of CKD, [38] and cardiovascular events in CKD
patients [45]. NLRP3, IL-1β, and IL-18 are significantly
upregulated in chronic kidney disease patients undergo￾ing hemodialysis treatment, indicating that the NLRP3
inflammasome may be activated in and contribute to
chronic inflammation in CKD [46].
Chronic inflammation can cause irreversible glomeru￾lar and tubular injury and renal functional loss. In 5/6
nephrectomy Munich-Wistar rats, macrophage infiltra￾tion is evident after ablation, the NLRP3 inflammasome
is activated, and M1 macrophage-related gene expres￾sion is increased; furthermore, the glomerulosclerosis
index is significantly higher with a progressive increase
in albuminuria, creatinine retention, and higher blood
pressure compared to the control rats [47]. In
nephrocalcinosis-related CKD mice, deposition of oxal￾ate crystal and tubular injury are associated with activa￾tion of NLRP3 inflammasomes; inhibition of NLRP3
induces a shift of macrophages from CD45+
F4/

CD206−
, an M1 pro-inflammatory
state, to CD45+
F4/80+
CD11b+
CD206+
TGFβ−
, an M2
anti-inflammatory phenotype, and attenuates the
progression of CKD [48]. In the Tokushima rat model,
activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes accelerates macro￾phage recruitment and M1 polarization, promoting
CXCL12 and high mobility group box-1 release in the
proximal tubule, and contributing to the progression of
diabetic nephropathy [49]. It is also observed clinically
that NLRP3 inflammasomes are activated and mature
IL-1β is released in anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic
antibody-associated glomerulonephritis patients [50].
NLRP3 activation also exacerbates renal fibrosis in
CKD. In CKD animal models and human patients, the
NLRP3 inflammasome components are upregulated in
infiltrating macrophages and other immune cells as well
as in podocytes and renal tubular epithelial cells [51].
Inflammasome activation escalates the inflammatory re￾sponse in macrophages and the crosstalk between mac￾rophages with other immune cells and renal
parenchymal cells [52]. In IgA nephropathy mice,
NLRP3 inflammasomes in macrophages are activated by
IgA immune complexes, leading to the loss of mitochon￾drial integrity and induction of mitochondrial ROS pro￾duction [53]. In UUO mice, the severity of renal fibrosis
correlates with infiltration of M1 macrophages [54],
which is related to the increase of NLRP3 expression
and activation [55]. Blockage of NLRP3 attenuates
macrophage infiltration, M1 polarization, decrease in
gene expression of connexins, TGF-β, connective tissue
growth factor and α-smooth muscle actin, reduction of
extracellular matrix deposition, and prevents renal fibro￾sis and loss of renal function [48, 54, 55].
Activation of intrarenal NLRP3 inflammasomes re￾leases IL-1β, IL-18 and other pro-inflammatory cyto￾kines, which is associated with increased renal
inflammation, injury, and fibrosis, and reduced renal
function, whereas NLRP3 inhibition induces a shift of
infiltrating renal macrophages from a pro-inflammatory
and profibrotic phenotype to an anti-inflammatory and
anti-fibrotic phenotype, and prevents renal injury and fi￾brosis in CKD animals and human patients [38, 48].
Therefore, the inflammasome-IL1β/IL-18 axis represents
an important mechanism for the pathogenesis of CKD.
Of note, recent evidence also demonstrates a role for
inflammasome-independent NLRP3 pathways in macro￾phages and macrophage polarization associated with
CKD [40, 48, 54], which needs further investigation.
Apolipoprotein L1 in macrophage function
Among many other macrophage molecules relevant to
innate immunity in the kidney, apolipoprotein L1
(APOL1) is particularly notable for its role in conferring
innate immunity to trypanosomal infections and the as￾sociation of its risk variants with CKD in humans [56].
APOL1 is a minor protein component of human plasma
high-density lipoprotein particles and confers innate
Lee et al. BMC Nephrology (2020) 21:270 Page 6 of 13

immunity to trypanosomal infections [57]. APOL1 forms
pores in lysosomes [58] and planar lipid bilayers [59] of
trypanosoma and this ability to compromise membrane
integrity likely contributes to its cellular toxicity in the
kidney (Fig. 2). Two common coding variants in APOL1,
G1 and G2, but not the wild type G0, are associated with
increased risk of CKD in individuals with sub-Saharan
African ancestry [61, 62]. APOL family genes are upregu￾lated by pro-inflammatory cytokines interferon -γ and
TNF, and APOL1 can restrict HIV-1 replication in
macrophages in vitro [63, 64].
Recent investigation of the molecular mechanisms
underlying APOL1-associated CKD suggests increased
innate immune function, leading to inflammatory cellu￾lar injury or death. APOL1 high-risk variants increase
kidney expression of ubiquitin D and chemokines
CXCL9 and CXCL11 [65]. In APOL1 overexpressing
THP-1 macrophages, all three APOL1 isoforms cause
monocytes to differentiate into atypical M1 macrophages
(Fig. 2) with a marked increase in M1 markers CD80,
TNF, IL1B, and IL6 and a modest increase in the M2
marker CD163 [60]. It seems this atypical M1
polarization itself is not sufficient to induce CKD,
because APOL1-G0 induces this atypical M1 polarization
as well [60]. Over-expression of APOL1 risk variants in￾creases gene expression of the pro-inflammatory cyto￾kines such as TNF, IL-1β and IL-6; increases gene and
protein expression of TGF-β; and increases production
of prostaglandin E2 [60]. Although APOL1 renal risk
variant-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines are consist￾ent with M1 polarization, there is also an increase in
prostaglandin E2 that promotes increased expression of
IL-10, mannose-receptor c-type 1 and arginase 2 genes
and a decrease in ROS production. This indicates that
APOL1 renal risk variant-mediated expressing macro￾phages have some M2 features [66].
APOL1 is expressed in macrophages [66, 67] and renal
parenchymal cells including podocytes, mesangial cells
and endothelial cells [68]. It is not yet clear whether
APOL1-associated CKD is caused by direct roles of
APOL1 risk variants on podocytes and other renal par￾enchymal cells or indirectly through innate immune re￾sponses by macrophage differentiation and polarization
and subsequent interaction with renal parenchymal cells.
Recent evidence demonstrates that an antisense oligo￾nucleotide of APOL1 efficiently protects against IFN-γ￾Fig. 2 Potential roles of ApoL1 in macrophage polarization. Based on our recent in vitro observation [60], overexpression of all APOL1 variants
differentiate macrophages into an atypical M1 state with a marked increase in M1 markers CD80 (not shown), TNF, IL1β, and IL6. Renal risk variants
induce additional TGF-β1 and CD204 (not shown) or CD206 (not shown) expression. Renal risk variants also increase PGE2 and TBX2 via the
increased expression of COX2, leading to release of TGF-β1. These results demonstrate a role of APOL1 variants in the regulation of macrophage
polarization and eicosanoid metabolism, which could promote inflammatory responses and alteration of CKD processing within the injured
kidney. Abbreviations: COX2, cyclooxygenase-2; IL, interleukin; PGE2, prostaglandin E2; TBX2, thromboxane B2; TGF, Transforming growth factor;

induced proteinuria in APOL1-G1 transgenic mice [68],
indicating that APOL1-induced M1 macrophage secre￾tion of interferon -γ, M1 polarization and subsequent
pro-inflammatory immune responses play at least partial
roles in the APOL1-associated CKD. In podocytes, TLR3
activation increases APOL1 expression by upregulating
interferon-dependent or interferon-independent pathway
[69], and APOL1 risk variants upregulate protein expres￾sion of NLRP3 inflammasome components and activa￾tion of NLRP3 inflammasomes [70]. Whether APOL1
risk variants interact with TLRs and activate NLRP3
inflammasomes in macrophages and play roles in macro￾phage polarization and progress of CKD warrants fur￾ther investigation.
Immunometabolism in macrophage polarization
Cellular metabolism is now recognized to be important
in macrophage polarization and function including anti￾gen presentation, clonal expansion, and wound healing
[71, 72]. The study of macrophage immunometabolism
holds great potential to deepen our understanding of
macrophage biology and identify potential therapeutic
targets [73, 74]. Different immune activities require that
M1 and M2 macrophages adapt their cellular metabol￾ism in order to produce specific metabolites and to meet
energy demands (Fig. 3). A key difference between M1
and M2 macrophages is the metabolism of arginine. M1
macrophages metabolize arginine to nitric oxide and cit￾rulline via nitric oxide synthase 2, and these products
are pro-inflammatory, cytotoxic, and in turn increase
production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species. In
contrast, M2 macrophages express arginases, ornithine
decarboxylase and spermidine oxidase, which hydrolyzes
arginine and produces ornithine and polyamines [75],
suppressing pro-inflammatory responses and promoting
repair of tissue damage. In concert with pro￾inflammatory nitric oxide production, M1 macrophages
upregulate flux through the pentose phosphate pathway
and increase production of NADPH, which is required
for the generation of NADPH oxidase-derived ROS. On
the other hand, M2 macrophages exhibit suppression of
the pentose phosphate pathway [76]. The different func￾tions of M1 and M2 macrophages are also associated
with characteristic energy metabolic alterations. M1
macrophages mainly rely on glycolysis for energy, while
M2 macrophages mainly use mitochondrial oxidative
phosphorylation [77].
Stimulation of TLRs induces increased glycolytic me￾tabolism in macrophages, which shows a similar glucose
metabolic pattern as classically activated M1 macro￾phages [78]. This increased glycolysis is thought to allow
macrophages to rapidly process carbon from glucose
and glutamine to generate biomolecules such as cyto￾kines, chemokines, and other inflammatory mediators
during the acute immune response to infection [78]. The
metabolic profile can be different with activation of dif￾ferent TLRs in macrophages. For example, activation of
TLR4 by LPS increases glycolysis and decreases oxidative
phosphorylation, while activation of TLR2 by Pam3-
CysSK4 increases glycolysis, oxygen consumption rate
and mitochondrial activity [79]. NLRP3 inflammasomes
are an important regulator of glycolysis [77]. NLRP3
inflammasomes have been shown to sense metabolites
such as palmitate, uric acid, and cholesterol crystals and
regulate glucose homeostasis [80]. In NLRP3-deficient
mice, reduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines is associ￾ated with reduction of pro-inflammatory factor MCP-1
and macrophage infiltration, which protected from de￾velopment of high fat diet-induced obesity and diabetic
nephropathy [81]. A recent study reveals that activation
of NLRP3 inflammasomes and the subsequent M1
macrophage polarization increases expression of glyco￾lytic enzymes and production of fructose 2, 6-
bisphosphate, which can be inhibited by blockage of
NLRP3 in macrophages [82]. Whether APOL1 modu￾lates metabolic reprogramming associated with macro￾phage polarization in CKD is not well understood.
The pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, consisting of
mitochondrial enzymes linking glycolysis and the tricarb￾oxylic acid cycle, contributes to the pathogenesis of hyper￾tension in spontaneously hypertensive rats [83], and might
play roles in macrophage polarization associated with acti￾vation of TLRs, NLRP3 inflammasomes, and expression of
APOL1 risk variants. Pyruvate drives the tricarboxylic acid
cycle within mitochondria. Accumulation of pyruvate and
its conversion into acetyl-CoA support production of
mitochondrial ROS via reverse electron transport coupled
with oxidative phosphorylation and ATP production, fatty
acid synthesis, and lipogenesis, which supports optimal in￾flammatory responses of M1 macrophages. The expres￾sion of enzymes that regulate pyruvate dehydrogenase
activity (e.g. pyruvate dehydrogenase kinases and phos￾phatases) may be concurrently induced in a given M1 or
M2 cell type, but are also tightly regulated by the cellular
microenvironment (Fig. 3). Identifying novel molecules
able to modify the metabolism of polarized macrophages
and lymphocytes in the kidney and able to modify the
course of progressive CKD represents a promising avenue
of investigation.
Therapeutic approaches
Preclinical and clinical studies have exploited knowledge
about macrophage polarization to design and test thera￾peutic interventions. Innate immune responses through
diverse PRRs are critical to macrophage polarization and
subsequent signaling cascades and release of pro- and
anti-inflammatory cytokines, which shape the progres￾sion of CKD. Recent enthusiasm in the effect of innate

immune responses on macrophage polarization has led
to the targeting of these macrophage polarization check￾points for potential novel therapy of CKD.
Blockade of TLR receptors and/or of their downstream
signaling adaptors has proven an attractive therapeutic
strategy for other disorders [84], and thus could also hold
promise for CKD. Eritoran, a specific TLR4 inhibitor, has
shown promise in attenuation of inflammation of experi￾mental dry eye diseases, influenza infection, and liver
ischemia-reperfusion injury [85]. TAK-242, another TLR4
inhibitor, ameliorates progressive tissue fibrosis in
preclinical fibrosis animals and in systemic sclerosis pa￾tients [86]. OPN-305, a humanized anti-TLR2 antibody,
decreased serum IL-6 level in a randomized, double-blind,
placebo-controlled clinical trial [87]. Oligonucleotide￾based antagonist compounds containing a (5-methyl-dC)p
(7-deaza-dG) or (5-methyl-dC) p (arabino-G) motif target￾ing TLR7, 8, and 9 have been reported to protect renal
function in certain CKD in clinical trials [88].
Strategies targeting NLRP3 inflammasomes have
mainly focused on the downstream proteins IL-1β and
caspase-1. Anakinra, recombinant IL-1Ra, is effective in
Fig. 3 Metabolic reprogramming and macrophage polarization. Consistent with their diverse function and energy demands, macrophages adapt
their metabolic programming in response to inflammation, injury, repair and fibrosis in CKD. Glycolysis is increased in activated macrophages with
an increase in pyruvate production. In M1 macrophages (left side), most pyruvate is not converted to acetyl-CoA due to the blockage of the TCA
cycle; rather, there is flux into the pentose phosphate pathway, generating NADPH, nucleotides and amino acids. Accumulation of citrate drives
fatty acid synthesis; the accumulation of succinate leads to induction of HIF-1α, promoting expression of inflammatory and glycolytic genes;
reverse electron transfer, along with increased NADPH, and HIF-1α, results in ROS overproduction, and activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes. In M2
macrophages (right side), pyruvate is converted into acetyl-CoA and enters the intact TCA cycle, leading to sustained ATP production via
oxidative phosphorylation and up-regulation of genes associated with tissue repair; increased levels of fatty acids enter the TCA cycle leading to
an increase in β-oxidation and energy production and a decrease in ROS production due to forward electron transfer. In M2 macrophages,
arginase-1 drives the production of polyamines and ornithine in contrast to conversion into citrulline and NO in M1 macrophages. F6P, fructose￾6-phosphate; G6P, glucose-6-phosphate; GLUT1, glucose transporter 1; NO, nitric oxide; PDC, pyruvate dehydrogenase complex; PPP, Pentose

gout flares in patients with advanced CKD; canakinu￾mab, an anti-IL-1β antibody, results in a significant re￾duction in the rate of major cardiovascular events in
patients with CKD; belnacasan, a selective caspase-1 in￾hibitor, reduces fibrosis formation in UUO mice;
MCC950, a specific NLRP3 inflammasome blocker, has
been shown to reduce both IL-1β and IL-18 production
and fibrosis in crystal-induced nephropathy mice [89].
Febuxostat and allopurinol, two urate lowering re￾agents, have been demonstrated to inhibit both TLR
and NLRP3 inflammasome activation and subsequent
M1 polarization, and are recent promising drugs for
CKD or CKD complications. Currently, there are six
clinical trials of these urate lowering reagents for
CKD patients in the US and UK listed in Clinical￾trial.gov. A pilot trial has so far shown that allopur￾inol improves renal function in diabetic nephropathy
patients, lowers systolic blood pressure, and reduces
the progression of renal disease in subjects with CKD
[90]. A Phase IV clinical trial to investigate febuxo￾stat, another urate-lowering reagent, on renal function
in CKD patients is enrolling participants (Clinical￾Trials.gov Identifier: NCT03990363).
The above PRR-targeting agents primarily inhibit in￾flammation and decrease M1 macrophage polarization.
Some agents that directly target macrophages and
macrophage polarization, for example, injection of
genetically overexpressed IL-4 macrophages [91] or
transfusion of IL-4/IL-13-differentiated bone-marrow
macrophages [92] have shown a consequent M2 macro￾phage phenotype and reduction of the degree of renal
glomerular inflammation and injury in rodents with
nephrotoxic nephritis. Curcumin, a glucose metabolic
homeostasis modulator, suppresses the M1 response
while promoting an M2 response that enhances
macrophage-mediated phagocytosis [93], and could draw
attention for potential application in CKD. Other agents
investigated target molecules in the local microenviron￾ment such as cytokines and ROS. For example, deletion
of TNF from macrophages is associated with lower
plasma creatinine and albuminuria in murine diabetic
nephropathy; of note, three TNF blockers have been
Fig. 4 Potential therapeutic targets for macrophage polarization in CKD. Macrophages demonstrate diverse functional phenotypes with two
extreme M1 (pro-inflammatory) and M2 (anti-inflammatory) polarization states in response to renal inflammation, injury, repair and fibrosis, which
implies that reduction of M1 polarization and induction of M2 polarization could be a promising therapeutic avenue for treatment of CKD. To
reduce M1 polarization, inhibitors of TLRs and NLRP3 inflammasomes are promising therapeutic targets in addition to inhibition of macrophage
recruitment, proliferation, and transition to myofibroblasts. Some of these agents are currently in Phase II or III trials [7]. To induce M2 polarization,
ex vivo IL-4/M-CSF injection, endotoxin precondition in sepsis injured mice, and induction of M1 to M2 switch have been described [8]. However,
roles of M2 macrophages in renal anti- versus pro-fibrotic pathology is controversial. Bardoxolone methyl, an activator of the Nrf2 pathway and
an inhibitor of the NF-κB pathway, has been evaluated in phase I to III clinical trials for a variety of human diseases including
CKD (www.clinicaltrials.gov)

approved for clinical treatment of rheumatic diseases
[94]. Tocilizumab, an anti-IL-6 receptor antibody, has
been used for treatment of rheumatic diseases, and is
now under investigation for the treatment of CKD [95].
Anti-oxidants, which target NF E2-related factor-2/heme
oxygenase-1 signaling and contribute to the M1 to M2
phenotype switch, are potential therapeutic targets in
diabetic nephropathy [96]. IL-10, TGF-β and IL-4, IL￾13-induced M2 macrophages exhibit protection of renal
damage in the murine adriamycin nephropathy model
[7]; however, the effect of IL-10 is still unresolved in a
clinical trial [97]. Anti-fibrotic therapies such as pirfeni￾done and FG3019 targeting TGF-β and connective tissue
growth factor in clinical trials also show intriguing
potential for clinical usage [98].
Although most of these agents have not been approved
for use in CKD patients, it should be noted that many
preclinical and preliminary clinical findings have shown
that the modulation of innate immune responses
through macrophage polarization is an alternative
approach for therapy of CKD (Fig. 4).
Conclusions
The studies reviewed here demonstrate that the innate
immune responses associated with macrophage
polarization contribute to the pathogenesis and progres￾sion of CKD. Macrophage polarization is highly dynamic
and is influenced by innate immune responses, which
are altered during CKD progression. TLRs, NLRP3,
APOL1 and its risk variants, their downstream signaling,
and associated alteration of metabolic processes such as
glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid cycle contribute to
the diversity of macrophage polarization and function in
CKD. Substantial progress has been made in defining
the molecular mechanisms underlying macrophage di￾versity in vitro. However, limited in vivo studies have
been performed to identify macrophage states and to es￾tablish their precise roles in the development or amelior￾ation of CKD. Next-generation sequencing-based
approaches including whole genome sequencing, whole
exome sequencing, and RNA-seq will likely identify vari￾ous genetic and epigenetic alterations important in
macrophage polarization associated with CKD. Exploring
the full spectrum of innate and adaptive immune re￾sponses and regulation of macrophage and lymphocyte
polarization holds tremendous promise to provide novel
therapeutic targets for progressive CKD.
