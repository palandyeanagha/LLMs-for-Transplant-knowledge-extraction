Summary
Severe acute hepatitis is a rare complication of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection. The authors report a case of an 8-month-old male infant
who presented with subacute fever and jaundice. The physical examination showed hepatosplenomegaly and ecchymoses on his
abdomen, chest wall and extremities. He received vitamin K therapy and prednisolone, and he recovered well without further
complications or sequelae. Although severe acute hepatitis is a rare complication of EBV infection, clinicians should recognise this
condition in order to provide a prompt treatment.
BACKGROUND
Hepatic involvement is a common presentation of EBV
infection. Moderately elevated serum transaminase are
found in more than 80% of cases but jaundice occurs in
less than 5%, and severe acute hepatitis is rare.1–3
EBV-related acute hepatitis should be considered as a pos￾sible causative agent, if there is no other reason for acute
hepatitis with jaundice in infants.1 There are different
degrees of severity of EBV hepatitis ranging from asymp￾tomatic to liver failure.4 Adequate supportive treatment
and close follow-up is necessary to help patients recover
from their clinical symptoms.1 We present an opportunity
for healthcare providers to identify and be aware of
EBV-related acute hepatitis in infants.
CASE PRESENTATION
An 8-month-old infant had high-grade fever and general￾ised ecchymosis on his abdomen, chest wall and both legs
8 days before admission to the Chiang Mai University
Hospital (CMUH). He did not have epistaxis, neither
haematemesis nor haematochezia. 5 days before admission
to the CMUH he developed jaundice and was admitted to
a provincial hospital. Physical examination showed that
his temperature was 38°C, that he looked pale and that he
had generalised ecchymosis. He received pack red cell
transfusion (10 ml/kg) and intravenous antibiotics (ampi￾cillin and gentamycin) for 2 days before admission to
CMUH. The mother reported no history of antenatal
care, vaccine and underlying diseases. He was born at
home and his birth weight was unknown. He did not
have a family history of malignancy or liver diseases. At
the CMUH, the physical examination revealed a tempera￾ture of 38.2°C, alertness, failure to thrive (his body weight
of 6 kg and height of 64 cm were both below the third
percentile), moderate pallor, marked jaundice and hepatos￾plenomegaly (his palpable liver was 4 cm below the right
costal margin and his spleen 3 cm below the left costal
margin; figure 1). Multiple ecchymoses were seen on his
abdomen, chest wall and extremities (figure 2).
INVESTIGATIONS
Laboratory values showed a haemoglobin level of 6.1 g/dl,
haematocrit of 19.5%, and a total white blood cell count
of 10.6×109 cells/l with 67% lymphocytes and 9% atyp￾ical lymphocytes. The platelet count was 378×109
/l.
A peripheral smear showed few schistocytes and few poly￾chromasia. Malaria was not found from a thick and thin
film. A liver function test revealed albumin of 2.8 g/dl,

total bilirubin of 13.4 mg/dl, direct bilirubin of 7.8 mg/dl,
aspartate aminotransferase (AST) of 323 U/l, alanine
transaminase (ALT) of 266 U/l, γ-glytamyl transpeptidase
(GGT) of 55 U/l, a prothrombin time (PT) of 226.9 s, a
partial thromboplastin time (PTT) of 96.9 s and an inter￾national normalised ratio (INR) of 19.3. Factors V and VII
analyses were not performed because the patient had
ecchymoses without clinical symptoms of active bleeding
and responded well to vitamin K treatment. After admin￾istration of 1 dose of vitamin K, his PT decreased to
28.3 s, his PTT to 44.4 s and his INR to 2.57. Ultrasound
abdomen revealed hepatosplenomegaly without focal
lesion. There was no ascites or lymphadenopathy, no dila￾tation of bile ducts and the gall bladder was normal.
Hepatitis B serologies and cytomegalovirus (CMV) anti￾body tests were negative. The EBV capsid antigen IgM
and IgG were analysed before the patient received a blood
transfusion and the result was positive. The analyses for
Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen (EBNA), early antigen (EA)
and viral load were not done because they were not avail￾able in our hospital. The HIV antibody test was non￾reactive and the haemoculture was negative.
DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
▸ Severe acute hepatitis induced by EBV infection
▸ Severe malnutrition and vitamin K deficiency
TREATMENT
The patient received 3 mg of vitamin K intravenously
once a day for 3 days, and prednisolone (1.5 mg/kg/day)
for 14 days along with supportive fluid therapy.
OUTCOME AND FOLLOW-UP
PTand PTT became normal within 2 days after initiation of
vitamin K therapy. The patient’s symptoms and laboratory
abnormalities improved within 2 weeks after treatment.
DISCUSSION
Most EBV infections in children are asymptomatic.
Primary infection in adolescents and adults results in acute
infectious mononucleosis syndrome. In young adults, the
complications of severe acute hepatitis from EBV infection
are uncommon.1 Most EBV-infected cases have a mild ele￾vation of liver enzymes during infection but the clinical
symptoms of severe hepatitis with jaundice are rare.2 Most
cases present with asymptomatic or mild illness accom￾panied by a mild elevation of hepatic enzymes.1–3
Generally, the levels of liver enzymes are not higher than
three times the normal level.5 Liver enzymes most likely
elevate during the second week of illness and return to
normal within 2–6 weeks. Less than 10% of patients
develop jaundice, mainly among the older population.2–4
Physicians should base their diagnosis of EBV infection on
clinical manifestations, virological and serological evidence
and the exclusion of conditions that are related to extrahe￾patic biliary obstruction.2 We diagnosed this patient to
have EBV induced acute hepatitis based on the evidence of
(1) a positive result for EBV capsid antigen IgM which nor￾mally rises in the first few weeks of acute infection,6 (2)
AST and ALT and levels which were markedly higher than
the GGT level, (3) the exclusion of other common viral
infections such as HIV and CMV infections and (4) the
exclusion of conditions related to biliary tract obstruction
such as biliary atresia. In this case, we suspected that the
patient had a vitamin K deficiency because he had never
received it since birth as other new-borns that are delivered
in a hospital. The lack of vitamin K may partially account
for his severe hepatitis after being infected with EBV.
Treatment of EBV is mainly supportive and symptomatic,
and most hepatic conditions resolve spontaneously. In this
case, we therefore provided vitamin K therapy for 3 days
intravenously accompanied by fluid therapy. In severe
cases, steroids and antiviral medications such as acyclovir
and ganciclovir may be used; however the efficacy of these
medications has not been proven through randomised
trials.3 4 Indications for the use of corticosteriods include
marked tonsillar inflammation with impending airway
obstruction, massive splenomegaly, myocarditis, haemo￾lytic anaemia or haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis.6
Steroid therapies may cause complications or delay the
recovery period in some cases and physicians should be
aware of this and provide the treatment under close moni￾toring.7 In this case, we treated the patient with prednisol￾one for 2 weeks since he had massive splenomegaly and
severe hepatitis, and his clinical symptoms improved
satisfactorily.

infection is a rare condition in infants.
▸ Physicians should base their diagnosis of EBV infection

▸ Indications for the use of corticosteriods in EBV

impending airway obstruction, massive splenomegaly,
myocarditis, haemolytic anaemia or haemophagocytic
