Abstract
Background: Chinese medicine syndromes (Zheng) in many disease models are not clearly characterized or
validated, and the concepts of Chinese medicine syndromes are confounding and controversial. Metabonomics has
been applied to the evaluation and classification of the Chinese medicine syndromes both in clinical and
nonclinical studies. In this study, we aim to investigate the evolution of the Chinese medicine syndrome in
myocardial infarction induced heart failure and to confirm the feasibility of the Zheng classification by plasma
metabonomics in a syndrome and disease combination animal model.
Methods: The heart failure (HF) model was induced by ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery
(LAD) in Sprague–Dawley rats. The rats were divided into the following two groups: the HF model group (LAD
ligation) and the sham operated group. GC-MS was used with pattern recognition technology and principal component
analysis (PCA) to analyze the plasma samples at 4, 21 and 45 day after operation.
Results: It was determined that the period from 7 to 28 days was the stable time window of ischemic heart failure with
qi deficiency and blood stasis syndrome (QDBS), and the qi deficiency syndrome occurred at 1 to 4 days and 45 to
60 days after operation. The results exhibited 5 plasma metabolite changes in the same trend at 4 and 21 day after the
LAD operation, 7 at 21 and 45 day, and 2 at 4 and 45 day. No metabolite showed the same change at all of the 3 time
points. At day 21 (the QDBS syndrome time point) after operation, 4 plasma metabolites showed the same trends with
the results of our previous study on patients with the blood stasis syndrome.
Conclusions: The syndrome diagnosis is reliable in the HF rat model in this study. Plasma metabolites can provide a
basis for the evaluation of Chinese medicine syndrome animal models.
Background
TCM is a complicated system, and the characteristics of
the diagnoses and treatments are based on evaluating
TCM syndromes, which are becoming more common in
clinical practice and have a history of more than one
thousand years. With the development of science, TCM
faces severe challenges and suffers from insufficient
modern research because the lack of scientific and
technological approaches restricts the development of
TCM [1,2]. Animal models play an important role in
basic research and in the evaluation of drug effects. To
reveal the biological basis of TCM syndromes and per￾form an objective evaluation of Chinese herbs, animal
models that have the features of the disease and syn￾dromes should be established.
Zheng classification (Bian Zheng) is a traditional diag￾nostic method to categorize patients’ syndromes based
on their presenting conditions [3]. A combination of
Zheng classification and biomedical diagnoses has be￾come a common model in TCM diagnostics in clinical
practice [3]. A novel analytical technique, metabonomics
(or metabolomics), adopts a ‘top-down’ strategy to reflect
the function of organisms from the terminal symptoms
of the metabolic network and to understand the meta￾bolic changes of a complete system caused by interven￾tions in the holistic context [1]. Metabonomics realistically

reflects the overall environment of various characteristic
changes in humoral metabolites and reveals the overall hu￾man metabolic network and the laws governing metabolic
changes under the influence of medicine [4]. This property
is consistent with the holistic philosophy of TCM and
might provide an opportunity to express scientifically the
meaning of evidence-based Chinese medicine, such as
Chinese medicine syndromes (CMS), preventive treatment,
the action of Chinese medicine, Chinese medical formulas
(CMF) and acupuncture efficacy [1,5]. In a clinical study,
the metabonomics method was applied to study clinical
urine samples in patients with suboptimal health with differ￾ent syndromes [6]. In nonclinical studies, the metabonomics
method has been applied in discussing the syndrome of the
stagnation of liver Qi and spleen deficiency and has assisted
in revealing the biological changes in the rats with chronic
restraint stress-induced syndrome of stagnation of the liver
Qi and spleen deficiency [5,6]. The analysis of plasma meta￾bonomics was applied in mini-swines with qi deficiency and
blood stasis syndrome from chronic myocardial ischemia [7]
and in research on the evaluation of the fever syndrome
model in rats [8]. In a combined clinical and nonclinical
study, the metabonomics method was used to analyze clin￾ical and animal plasma samples in coronary heart disease
with the blood stasis syndrome [9].
Gas chromatography (GC)- Mass Spectrometry (MS)
with electron ionization remains the technique of choice
for the metabolic profiling of the polar intermediates of
primary metabolism because of its high sensitivity, its
ability to better discriminate the compounds in the gas
phase than the liquid phase and the ability to identify
unknown compounds based on fragmentation patterns
and the existence of well-established analysis databases
for metabolite identification [10,11]. The high sensitivity
of GC-MS could allow for the quantification of metabo￾lites present in small amounts and might indicate subtle
physiological differences between samples that might be
undetectable in an LC-MS profile [12,13]. For these ad￾vantages to occur, the GC-MS metabolic profile must be
appropriately corrected for experimental biases.
This study used time course plasma metabonomics ana￾lyses based on GC-MS with pattern recognition technology,
principal component analysis (PCA) and the combined dis￾ease/syndrome animal model of myocardial infarction (MI)
induced heart failure (qi deficiency/qi deficiency and blood
stasis) in rats to screen for possible differences in the charac￾teristics of metabolites and characteristic pattern combina￾tions and to investigate the material basis of the evolution of
syndromes in HF rats.
Methods
Animals and groups
All the animal experiments were performed in accord￾ance with the China Physiological Society’s “Guiding
Principles in the Care and Use of Animals” with the ap￾proval of the Animal Care Committee of Beijing Medical
Center. A total of 60 male SD rats (weighing 240 ± 10 g)
of SPF grade were selected (purchased from Beijing Vital
River Laboratory Animal Technology Co. Ltd. Beijing,
China) for this study. The rats were housed in a stand￾ard animal room with food and water provided ad libi￾tum under controlled conditions of humidity and
temperature (25 ± 1.2°C) with a 12 h light: 12 h dark
schedule.
HF model preparation
The HF model was established as described previously
[14]. Pentobarbital-anesthetized rats were restrained on
the operating table. The thoracic cavity was opened to
expose the heart, and the left coronary artery (LAD) was
ligated. In the sham operated group, sutures were passed
under the LAD without ligation. The animals were
housed routinely following surgery. At 4, 21 and 45 d
after the operation, the animals were anesthetized using
isoflurane (Abraxis BioScience, Richmond Hill, Ontario,
Canada) following an overnight fast, with eight rats ex￾amined at each time point. The blood samples were ob￾tained via tail puncture, and the plasma was isolated
after centrifugation of the blood samples at 1700 × g at
4°C within the first hour after blood collection. The
plasma samples were stored at −80°C until the plasma
metabonomics analyses of heart failure with qi defi￾ciency and blood stasis (QDBS) were performed.
Evaluation of the disease and TCM syndrome
The ECG, physical signs, echocardiography, blood stud￾ies and colorimetric analysis of images including auricle,
plantar and tongue were used to evaluate qi deficiency
and blood stasis syndrome in model animals.
ECG
The surface electrocardiograms (ECG) were obtained by
FX7200 ECG (Fukuda, Japan) at day 3 after operation, in
order to determine the myocardial infarction size in MI
rats.
Physical signs
The rats’ body weight, respiratory rate in the resting
state, and other physical signs were obtained at 4, 7, 14,
21, 28, 45, 60 day after surgery.
Echocardiography
Transthoracic echocardiography was performed using ACU￾SON Sequoia 512 with 15L8W-S transducer (Siemens,
Germany). The rats were anesthetized with pentobar￾bital sodium (1%, 20 mg/kg IP) at 4, 7, 14, 21, 28, 45
and 60 day after surgery. The rats were kept on a
heated platform for the acquisition of 2-dimensionally

guided M-mode images at the tip of the papillary
muscles.
Blood studies
Blood (sodium citrate 1:9) was collected from the rats at
4, 7, 14, 21, 28, 45 and 60 days after surgery. The blood
was divided into 4 groups: plasma, whole blood, and
platelet-rich plasma, and the detected indexes including
hematocrit, platelet aggregation rate (Platelet Aggreg￾ometer DIC PA-3210, JAPAN), plasma viscosity, blood
viscosity (Rotary Viscometer LBY-W6, Percil, CHINA)
and fibrinogen. The methods followed the reference [4].
Colorimetric analysis of images of the auricle, plantar and
tongue
After taking pictures of the auricle, foot plant and
tongue surface in 20 rats (10 in each group) at every
time point after the operation, the color indexes were
analyzed using Photoshop software. All the pictures were
acquired with the correction of a Casmatch color and
size-matching sticker (BEAR medic corporation, Japan)
following the instructions.
GC–MS analysis
Chemicals
The following chemicals were used in the GC–MS ana￾lysis: chlorotrimethylsilane, TMCS from Fluka Inc. (CA,
USA), methyl cyanides from Fisher Co., Ltd. (CA, USA),
N-Methyl-N- (trimethylsilyl)-trifluoroacetamide (MSTFA)
from Fluka Inc. (CA, USA) and methoxylamine hydro￾chloride from Fisher Co., Ltd. (CA, USA).
Sample preparation
At 4, 21 and 45 days after operation, the animals were
anesthetized using isoflurane (Abraxis BioScience, Rich￾mond Hill, Ontario, Canada) following an overnight fast,
with eight rats examined at each time point. The blood
samples were obtained via tail puncture, and the plasma
was isolated after centrifugation of the blood samples at
1700 × g at 4°C within the first hour after the blood col￾lection. The plasma samples were stored at −80°C until
the plasma metabonomics analyses of heart failure with qi
deficiency and blood stasis (QDBS) were performed.
Plasma preparation was performed as described [7].
Methyl cyanide (250 μL) was mixed into 100-μL aliquots
of the plasma samples at each time point. The samples
were centrifuged at 12100 × g for 10 min after being
placed in an ice bath for 10 min. A 250-μL aliquot of
the supernatant was transferred to an Eppendorf tube
with a pierced cap. The samples were dried in a vacuum
centrifuge dryer and in a freeze dryer. For derivatization,
50 μL of methoxylamine hydrochloride in pyridine
(15 mg/mL; the first derivatizing agent) were added to
the samples. The mixture was incubated at 70°C for
60 min, after which the second derivatizing agent, con￾sisting of 50 μL of a mixed solvent (MSTFA: MCS =
100: 1, v/v), was added. The mixture was incubated at
room temperature for 60 min. One hundred microliters
of n-heptane containing docosanoic acid (0.10 mg/mL),
was added as an internal standard, and the solution was
mixed and centrifuged (1812 × g, 10 min). The super￾natant was transferred to a micro-injector tube, and a
1-μL sample was injected in split mode (25:1, v/v).
Sample analysis
Chromatography was performed using the TRACE GC
Ultra-DSQ II GC/MS system (Thermo Fisher Scientific,
Massachusetts, USA) using an RTx-5 capillary column
(30 m × 0.250 mm × 0.25 μm), the Xcalibur workstation
and the NIST spectral library [7]. The injection temperature
was 270°C, and the helium gas flow rate through the col￾umn was 1 ml/min. The column temperature was isother￾mally maintained at 80°C for 5 min and raised to 300°C at a
rate of 10°C/min. The temperature was then isothermally
maintained at 300°C for 5 min. The temperatures of the
transfer line and the ion source were 280°C and 230°C, re￾spectively. The ions were generated at an electron impact
(EI) energy of 70 kV, and 20 scans/s were recorded over the
mass range of 45–550 m/z. The column temperature pro￾gram was in Table 1.
GC–MS data acquisition and alignments
The primitive GC/MS data mapping files were imported
directly into MATLAB (MathWorks, Inc., USA) script
and preprocessed. This process can be divided into steps
including denoising smoothing, baseline correction, peak
calibration, split window, overlapping peak identification
and peak area integration. A three-dimensional matrix
was obtained, and the three-dimensional coordinates
were as follows: the characteristics of the compound
index (expressed as the mass-to-charge ratio), the sam￾ple name, and the normalized peak area. According to
the GC-MS total ion chromatogram, the peak retention
time of each selected peak, all of the test compound
spectra and retention indices were compared with the
spectra and retention indices of the U.S. National Insti￾tute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Library (2008)
for peak identification; the results were considered reli￾able because more than 80% of the results were

identified based on these comparisons. The peak area
data were obtained and expressed as a percentage based
on the peak area metabolite levels.
Multivariate analysis of the samples
The intensities of each peak were normalized based on
the creatinine concentrations determined for each ani￾mal. The generated peak lists were imported into
SIMCA-P (Ver.11.5) (Umetrics, Sweden) for a multivari￾ate statistical analysis. A principal component analysis
(PCA) was performed to identify the relationships be￾tween the various groups of multivariate data in terms
of the similarities or differences. In the t test mining
conducted to make comparisons between the groups,
P <0.05 indicates a significant difference. The princi￾pal component scores were analyzed using analysis of vari￾ance (ANOVA) and multiple comparison tests; P <0.05
was considered statistically significant.
Results
The syndrome diagnosis
The results of the body weight, respiratory rate, blood
studies, echocardiography and colorimetric analysis of
rats are given in Additional file 1: Table S1.
ECG
Pathological Q waves were observed in 6–8 leads on a
surface electrocardiogram in the model animals. No sig￾nificant arrhythmias were found in the experimental
period.
Physical signs
There were no significant differences on the body
weight between model and sham rats at the same
time point. The respiratory rates of model rats were
slower at each time point in the resting state when
comparing to the sham operation rats. During the
period 1 to 3 days after operation, the model rats
and the sham operated rats acted slowly in activity
and response to external stimuli; 4 to 6 days after
the operation, the model rats were sensitive to exter￾nal stimuli, mental stress, irritation, fear, showing
hair erection and lack of luster, and the sham rats’
performances gradually returned to normal; 7 to
60 days after surgery, the model animals appeared to
show hair erection and lack of luster, significantly re￾duced activity, gradually slower responses to external
stimuli, and weakness, whereas the sham rats’ perfor￾mances were normal.

Echocardiography
The left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and left
ventricular fractional shortening (LVFS) were signifi￾cantly decreased at different time points after LAD (P <
0.05, P < 0.01) in the model rats compared with the
sham rats. The results showed a segmental dysfunction
of the left ventricular.
Blood studies
Compared with the sham operated group, the PA%, AV
(50S-1, 200S-1), RV (10S-1, 50S-1) at 7 days; the PCV%,
PA%, AV (10S-1, 50S-1) and RV 10S-1 at 14 days; the
PCV%, AV (10S-1, 50S-1, 200S-1) and RV 10S-1; and
PCV%, AV 10S-1 were increased significantly (P < 0.05
or P < 0.01) in the model group.
Colorimetric analysis of images of the auricle, plantar and
tongue
Compared with the sham operated group, the plantar R￾value was decreased (P < 0.05) at 7 days after operation,
and the three color indexes (including the R, G and B
values) were decreased at 14, 21 and 28 days (P < 0.05, P <
0.01); the tongue R-value (p < 0.01) and G-value (p < 0.05)
were decreased at 14 days, and the tongue B-value (p <
0.01) was increased significantly in the model rats. During
the period 7 to 28 days after surgery, the auricle in the
model rats had visible varicose veins and purple color, and
the ear skin became pale. The auricle G-value was de￾creased significantly (p < 0.05) compared with the sham
rats.
According to the blood stasis diagnostic criteria pub￾lished by the China Association of Integrative Medi￾cine, Professional Committee on Blood Circulation in
1986 and the TCM deficiency syndrome reference
standard published by the National Integrative Defi￾ciency & Geriatrics Research Committee in May 1986,
combined with the five aspects above, the syndromes
of the myocardial infarction caused heart failure rats
were diagnosed. The period from 7 to 28 days is the
stable heart failure with qi deficiency and blood stasis
(QDBS) time window, and the two periods, 1–4 days
and 45–60 days after the operation were diagnosed as
the qi deficiency syndrome. The blood samples from
both groups were analyzed by GC-MS at 4, 21, and
45 day after operation in 3 syndrome time windows
respectively.

The results of GC/MS analysis
Typical GC-MS total ion chromatograms for plasma samples
at each time point following the operation
The results of plasma samples analysis from the
model and sham rats are shown in Figures 1, 2 and
3. Based on the automatic peak identification proce￾dures and standard database, this study identified a
variety of metabolites, including small organic mole￾cules such as amino acids, and other compounds such
as liposome components. In the total ion chromato￾gram, the peaks showed a clear difference between
the model and sham groups.
At day 4 after operation, metabolites changes were ob￾served in model rats after compared to sham ones. The
increases were observed in the levels of energy-related
metabolites such as citric acid and cAMP; amino acid
metabolites such as L-norvaline and glycine; sugar me￾tabolites such as à-D-glucopyranoside; and lipid metabo￾lites such as dodecanoic acid, hexadecanoic acid and
octadecanoic acid. Decreases were observed in the levels
of amino acid metabolites such as acetamide, trimethyl￾silyl amine, alanine, L-valine, urea, L-serine; the glucose
metabolites such as d-glucose, d-galactose and glucitol;
and the fatty acid metabolites such as acetic acid, propa￾noic acid and butanoic acid. These results are shown in
Figure 1.
At day 21 after operation, the metabolites changes
in model group including the increases in energy￾related metabolites such as citric acid; amino acid
metabolites such as acetamide, ethylbis (trimethylsilyl)
amine, alanine, L-norvaline, L-valine, urea and L￾serine; the glucose metabolite à-D-glucopyranoside;
and lipid metabolites such as acetic acid, propanoic
acid, butanoic acid, dodecanoic acid, hexadecanoic
acid and octadecanoic acid; and decreases in energy￾related metabolites such as cAMP, amino acid metab￾olites such as glycine and L-proline. These results are
shown in Figure 2.
At day 45 after operation, the model group showed
metabolic changes including increased levels of amino
acid metabolites such as ethylbis (trimethylsilyl) amine
and L-serine and lipid metabolites such as propanoic acid
and butanoic acid; and decreases in the levels of energy￾related metabolites such as citric acid and cAMP; amino
acid metabolites such as acetamide, alanine, L-norvaline,
L-valine, urea and L-serine; the glucose metabolite

à-D-glucopyranoside; and fatty acid metabolites such
as hexadecanoic acid and octadecanoic acid. These re￾sults are shown in Figure 3.
Pattern recognition and multi-dimensional statistical
analysis
Principal components analysis (PCA) was conducted to
achieve a reduction of data dimensionality, exclude
overlapping information and convert the original
variables into a small number of new variables that were
linear combinations of the original variables. These new
variables were employed to characterize the structure of
the original data without a loss of information [15].
In this study, the PCA method was applied to compare
the GC spectra obtained in model and sham rats, and
the results are shown in Figures 4, 5 and 6. The compos￾ition of the plasma displayed stability in all of the sam￾ples, and most of the identified compounds were
clustered in a specific area. The metabolites that showed
clear differences and contributed markedly to the PCA
classification included citric acid, cAMP, stearic acid,
palmitic acid, lauric acid, urea, norvaline and α-D￾glucose glycoside compounds. The representative metab￾olites in the plasma and the changes in the GC peak
signal intensity for the various metabolites are listed in
Tables 2, 3 and 4.

To better conclude the results of GC-MS analysis,
we compared metabolic alterations in different time
point (Figure 7). In addition to the 14, 9, and 11 me￾tabolites signature that distinguished qi-deficiency
and QDBS syndrome from non-qi deficiency and
non-QDBS respectively, 14 additional metabolites
were detected in all the 3 time point with different
change trend. There were 5 metabolites showed the
same change trend between 4 and 21 day, 7 between
21 and 45 day, and 2 between 45 and 4 day, which
reflected the evolution of syndromes.
Discussion
Currently, combination of Zheng classification and bio￾medical diagnosis becomes a common model in TCM
diagnostics in both clinical and nonclinical practice. In
our previous study, the Data mining technology based
on the Shannon entropy mutual information was used
to analysis the complicated correlations of the statistical
distribution of coronary heart disease syndromes associ￾ated physical and chemical indexes. We founded that
echocardiography and hemorheology was the most closely
correlated index with qi-deficiency and blood-stasis syn￾drome respectively [16]. In clinical research, Li H holds
that LVEF can reflect the severity of heart failure, and
could be taken as the beneficial objective and quantitative
indices for syndrome pattern differentiation [17]. In non￾clinical research, echocardiography and respiratory rate
was used to evaluate the effect of Qiliqiangxin capsule on
cardiac function in rats with chronic heart failure of
heart qi deficiency [18]. The indexes such as tongue
appearances, blood hyperviscosity platelet aggregation
rate and fibrinogen were widely use in the evaluation
of blood stasis in both clinical and nonclinical research
[19-21]. Moreover, LARS showed that there was a sig￾nificant correlation between color indexes and the re￾sults of hematocrit and platelet aggregation rate in our
previous study [22].
Recently, many disease models are not clearly charac￾terized or validated in the Chinese medicine syndrome
and metabonomics are confounding and controversial
concepts. Wang X believes that trying to connect
western medicine and traditional oriental medicine
using the metabonomics approach is probably prema￾ture at this stage because there is no definitive clinical
characterization of traditional oriental medicine [1].
Blood is the most important substance that comes
in contact with tissues [23], which contains many
types of nutrients such as inorganic salts, sugars,
amino acids, lipids and hormones that directly reflect

the changes occurring in the body from biological
activities [24].
In the present study, the characteristics of qi defi￾ciency were shown in the entire time window from 4 to
60 days after the operation, with a significantly slowed
breathing rate and decreased heart function, which are
closely related to energy metabolism [25]. It was re￾ported that myocardial ischemia and hypoxia lead to
glucose metabolism disorders because glucose metabol￾ism requires adequate oxygen [26], and 80% prevalence
of coronary artery disease in patients with abnormal glu￾cose metabolism in China [27]. The present results sug￾gested an association of heart failure with qi deficiency
with a glucose metabolism disorder. A low glucose me￾tabolism level might serve as a biomarker of qi defi￾ciency. Because of the ischemia and hypoxia of the body,
energy metabolism decreased in cells, which resulted in
the increase of citric acid in plasma. The cAMP level in
plasma increased significantly which subjected to ische￾mia and hypoxia related to the mobilization of energy
reserves under stress. Fatty acid oxidation became the
major mode of energy supply when glucose metabolism
disordered. This type of fat-related myocardial metabol￾ism disorder not only increased ATP consumption and
decreased ATP synthesis, but also increased myocardial
oxygen consumption, which accelerates the process of
cardiac dysfunction [28]. At day 45 after operation, the
rats with qi deficiency were suffering from aggravated
heart dysfunction, with significantly decreased citric acid,
and the decrease of relevant metabolites reflected the
metabolic failure of glucose, fat, and protein, and coin￾cided with the reduced movement, aggregation and
changes of respiratory rate in model rats. Moreover, the
identical changes trend of Alanine and L-Valine on 4 and
45 day suggested that it is possible to excite the same syn￾drome at different time point.
During 7 ~ 28 days after the operation, the syndrome
of blood stasis appeared in the qi deficiency rats with be￾havioral stress; colorimetric change of auricle, plantar
and tongue; and increased prominence of peripheral cir￾culatory disorders of blood stasis. The plasma metabo￾nomics at 21 days after the operation showed a high
level of citric acid, glucose, amino acids, and fatty acids
when compare to the sham group, which indicated full
mobilization of energy reserves. The increased catechol￾amine indicated the activation of sympathetic adrenergic
system, which leading to the activation of protein lipase
activity and increased endogenous lipolysis, so the high
level of free fatty acids was detected [29]. The blood
metabolic changes of glucopyranoside, dodecanoic acid,
hexadecanoic acid and octadecanoic acid at 21 days
showed the same trends with the metabolites of clinical

patients with blood stasis syndrome in our previous
study [9].
Interestingly, lipid metabolism disorder was detected
at all of the three time points, even though the animals
were not given a high-fat diet and did not receive other
lipid interventions. At day 4 after the operation, the in￾creases of dodecanoic acid, hexadecanoic acid and octa￾decanoic acid were detected. At day 21 after the operation,
the changes of butanoic acid, propanonic acid, acetic acid
and mononolinoleoylglycerol were observed. In particular,
the decrease of mononolinoleoylglycerol might lead to the
alterations of triglyceride level, cholesterol metabolism and
lipid deposition, which match the necessary conditions for
the development of coronary atherosclerosis. With the evo￾lution of the syndrome, the status of the lipid metabolism
disorder at the 45 day after the operation became relatively
stable when compared to 21 day, indicating that continued
abnormal lipid metabolism was associated with the evolu￾tion of ischemic syndromes.
Moreover, 14 metabolites were detected in all of the 3
time points, but without the same change trend, which
might associated with the evolution of syndromes.
This study had several limitations. First, only one time
point was analyzed in the same syndrome in this re￾search. Second, because there were no published reports
on the metabonomics of qi deficiency patients, the qi de￾ficiency characters in this animal model need further
verification.
Conclusions
The Chinese medicine syndrome evolution was “qi
deficiency-qi deficiency and blood stasis-qi deficiency” in
an LAD ligation-induced model of HF in rats from 4 ~
60 day after operation. The time course plasma metabo￾nomics analysis provides evidence for the syndrome evo￾lution. The QDBS and non-QDBS syndrome, as well as
