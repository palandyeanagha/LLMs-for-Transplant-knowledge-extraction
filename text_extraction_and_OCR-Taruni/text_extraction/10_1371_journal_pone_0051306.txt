Abstract
Background: Epstein Barr virus-associated lymphoproliferative disease is an increasing complication in patients with
immunosuppressive conditions. Although the current therapies for this disorder are effective, they are also associated with
significant toxicity. In an attempt to identify newer therapeutic agents, this study investigated the effects of Resveratrol,
a naturally occurring polyphenolic compound, on the EBV transformation of human B cells.
Methodology/Principal Findings: This study demonstrates that resveratrol prevents EBV transformation in human B cells.
These effects are mediated by specific cytotoxic activities of resveratrol against EBV-infected B cells that are associated with
the downregulation of the anti-apoptotic proteins Mcl-1 and survivin. This occurs as a consequence of the inhibition of EBV￾induced NFkB and STAT-3 signaling pathways and a resveratrol-induced decrease in the expression of the oncogenic viral
product LMP1 in EBV-infected B cells. In addition, resveratrol decreased the expression of miR-155 and miR-34a in EBV￾infected B cells, blocked the expression of the anti-apoptotic viral gene BHRF1, and thus interrupted events that are critical
for EBV transformation and the survival of EBV-transformed cells.
Conclusions/Significance: These results suggest that resveratrol may therefore be a potentially effective therapeutic
alternative for preventing EBV-associated lymphoproliferative diseases in immune compromised patients.

Introduction
Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) is a life￾threatening complication that develops as a consequence of
ineffective T-cell function due to immunosuppressive therapy in
recipients of hematopoietic stem cell (HSCT) or solid organ
transplantation (SOT). PTLD is associated with Epstein-Barr virus
(EBV) infection of B cells and encompasses a heterogeneous group
of disorders ranging from benign mononucleosis-like illnesses to
aggressive non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas [1].
EBV is an oncogenic herpes virus that is linked with several
malignant disorders, including Hodgkin’s lymphoma, Burkitt’s
lymphoma, gastric cancer and nasopharyngeal carcinoma [2]. The
EBV genome is a 172 kb double-stranded DNA linear molecule
that encodes more than 100 viral proteins, although in latent
infected cells only a limited number of gene products are expressed
and these include six EBV nuclear antigens (EBNA1, -2, -3A, -3B,
-3C, and -LP), three latent membrane proteins (LMP1, -2A, -and
2B), and two small nonpolyadenylated RNAs EBER 1 and 2 [3].
Two viral products, EBNA2 and LMP1, are absolutely required
for the in vitro transformation of B cells whereas EBNA1, EBNA3A
and EBNAC are not indispensable, but nevertheless play a crucial
role in the B cells transformation process [3]. Other EBV factors,
including the viral Bcl-2 analogous BALF1 and BHRF1, also play
critical roles in B-cell transformation since their very early
expression after infection, prevents EBV-infected B cells from
undergoing apoptosis [4].
Primary EBV infection, which usually occurs in childhood, is
generally asymptomatic; however EBV infection may cause
infectious mononucleosis when acquired in adolescence or adult￾hood. EBV persists for life in the memory B cells compartment
and reactivation of EBV is prevented by an effective immuno￾surveillance mediated through virus-specific T-cell immunity [5].
However, infected B cells can proliferate without control in the
absence of an effective immune response, resulting in malignant
transformation. This process is exemplified by the development
PTLD or lymphoproliferative disorders in patients undergoing
immunosuppressive therapy for other medical conditions [6,7].
Currently, reactivation of EBV is an increasing complication in
immune deficient patients, particularly after HSCT or SOT [7].
Whereas the tapering of immunosuppression, donor lymphocyte
infusion, and rituximab may be effective for this complication after
HSCT, severe adverse events such as fatal graft-versus-host disease
and infections could develop thereafter [8,9], therefore effective
but less toxic anti-EBV therapies are needed.

Resveratrol (3, 49, 5 tri-hydroxystilbene) is a naturally occurring
polyphenol found in red wine, grapes and other sources [10].
Numerous health benefits have been associated with resveratrol
including anti-inflammatory, anti-aging and antitumor activities
[10,11]. The broad anti-cancer activities of resveratrol are exerted
by a particular property of this compound to target multiple
proteins including the NFkB, STAT-3, and AKT pathways which
are all involved in the regulation of cell proliferation, survival and
apoptosis [11–13]. Several studies have reported inhibitory
activities of resveratrol against various virus including herpes
simplex virus 1 and 2, Varicella zoster virus, human cytomega￾lovirus, and influenza virus, however, the mechanisms for such
antiviral properties have not been clearly defined [14,15].
The current study investigated the potential antiviral effects of
resveratrol against EBV, and focused on the modulation of the
oncogenic properties of this virus. This study took advantage of the
ability of EBV to transform B cells into lymphoblastoid cell lines
(LCL) in vitro, which recapitulates many aspect of the EBV-related
malignant transformation. The data revealed that resveratrol
effectively prevented the EBV-induced transformation of B cells,
which was mediated by the inhibitory effects of resveratrol on
multiple genes involved in transformation and survival of human B
cells. This is the first report to show mechanistic insights into the
efficacy of resveratrol to prevent EBV-related transformation and
the proliferation of human B cells.
Materials and Methods
Cell Lines
The EBV producing cell line B95-8 was obtained from the
American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD) and they were
cultured in RPMI 160 medium supplemented with 10% FBS and
1% penicillin and streptomycin. The Akata cell line carrying the
EGFP-EBV [16], which is a Burkitt lymphoma-derived cell line
[17] were obtained from Dr K. Takada (Hokkaido University).
These cells were cultured in RPMI 160 medium supplemented
with 10% FBS and 500 mg/ml G418 as described [16].
Reagents
Resveratrol and anti-a tubulin antibody were purchased from
Sigma. Hygromycin was obtained from Wako (Tokyo Japan). The
NFkB luciferase report vector pGL4.32 [-luc2PNFkB –RE/
Hygro] was acquired from Promega. The antibodies directed
against survivin, Mcl-1, phosphorylated STAT-3, histone H3 and
phosphorylated p65 were purchased from Cell Signaling Tech￾nology. Anti-EBNA1 clone 1B5 (Acris Herford, Germany), anti￾EBNA2 clone PE2, anti-human IgG and anti-LMP1 clone CS1-4
were from DakoCytomation (Glostrup, Denmark). Recombinant
proteins including IL-4, IL-10, soluble CD40 ligand and TNF￾a were purchased from PeproTech (Rocky Hill NJ).
Preparation of EBV Virions
EBV-harboring B95-8 cells at a logarithmic phase were
suspended in fresh medium seeded at a density of 106 cells/mL
and were cultured for 3 days. EGFP-EBV was obtained from the
culture medium of Akata cells in which EBV production had been
induced by surface immunoglobulin G (sIgG) cross-linking as
described previously ( [16]. The culture supernatants were clarified
by centrifugation, filtered and stored at 280uC until use.
Cell Preparation
Blood samples from healthy volunteers were collected under
a protocol approved by the Institutional Review Board of the
Kanazawa University School of Medical Sciences. Peripheral
blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) derived from the whole blood of
7 healthy volunteers and cord blood mononuclear cells (CB￾MNCs) obtained from 3 anonymous donors were isolated by
density gradient centrifugation using Lymphoprep (Axis-Shield,
Oslo, Norway). Primary B cells were purified from the PBMC
fractions of 3 donors by negative selection using magnetic beads
Miltenyi Biotec (Gladbach, Germany) according to the manufac￾turer’s specifications. These primary cells were cultured in RPMI
160 medium supplemented with 20% FBS and 1% penicillin and
streptomycin designated herein after as culture medium. In
experiments using PBMC, the culture medium was supplemented
with Cyclosporine A (500 nM/ml; Sigma, Marlborough, MA) to
inhibit T-cells immunity.
EBV-transformation Assays
Three different approaches were used to investigate the effects
of resveratrol on B cell EBV transformation efficiency. First,
PBMCs, CB-MNC (26106 cells/mL) or purified B cells (0.56106
cells/mL) were exposed to a defined virus dose (50 moi) for two
hours at 37uC and then seeded in replicate wells of 96-well plates
in medium containing several concentrations of resveratrol or
vehicle (DMSO 0.05%). In a second set of experiments, cells were
infected with a range of virus dilutions before being seeded into
a 96-well plate in the presence or absence of resveratrol (50 mM).
In another assay, cells were exposed to a defined virus dose (50
moi) and then seeded at three-fold limiting dilutions into replicate
wells of a 96-well plate. Fresh medium containing the drug was
replaced once per week. In all cases, the percentage of wells
containing EBV-transformed cell clones was assessed with
microscopic inspection six weeks after infection.
Infection experiments for protein and mRNA analysis were
performed by exposing purified B cells (16106
) to EBV and then
harvesting the cells at different time points post-infection. LCLs
were generated from PBMCs (2 donors) and one CB-MNC donor
by infecting 26106 cells with the supernatant of B95-8EBV and
expanded into 25 ml flasks. Cultures were maintained in
exponential growth using passaging twice weekly. LCLs were
treated with sodium butyrate (5 mM) for 3 days in some
experiments, to induce lytic infection and their RNA was extracted
and used for quantitative real time PCR.
Infection of Human B cells with GFP-EBV
Purified B cells (0.56106
) derived from 3 healthy donors were
infected with GFP-EBV suspension in 500 mL of RPMI medium
supplemented with 10% FBS and incubated for 4 hrs at 37uC.
The cells were centrifuged, the supernatant was discarded and
then the cells were resuspended in fresh RPMI culture medium in
the presence or absence of resveratrol. The infected cells were
harvested at several time points and the percentage of GFP
expressing cells were determined by flow cytometry. The number
of apoptotic cells in the EGFP positive fraction, were assessed by
staining the cells with annexin V and 7-AAD followed by flow
cytometry analysis.
B cell Proliferation Assay
Activated B cells were generated as previously described [18]
with some modifications. In brief, unseparated PBMCs (56105
/
well) from three healthy donors were cultured in RPMI medium
supplemented with 20% human serum, 50 ng/ml IL-4 and
10 mg/ml of recombinant soluble CD40L [19] and cyclosporine
A in the presence or absence of resveratrol (50 mM). The cells were
restimulated every four days with fresh medium containing
cytokines with or without resveratrol. After 14 and 21 days of
culture, the number of CD19+ B cells was assessed using flow

cytometry. In some experiments, EBV-immortalized LCL cells
(16106 cells/ml) were plated in 96-well plates and cultured for 72
hours in the presence or absence of resveratrol and assessed for
viability and proliferation using an MTT colorimetric assay
(Roche, Indianapolis, IN, USA). The inhibition rate of cell
proliferation was calculated by the formula: % inhibition = (ab￾sorbance of control cells – absorbance of treated cells)/absorbance
of control cells6100.
LDH Assay
Purified B cells (26105 cells/ml) from three donors were
suspended in RPMI 1640 phenol free medium supplemented
with 2.5% BSA and 1% FBS, plated in 96-well plates and cultured
for 12, 24, 48 and 72 hrs in the presence or absence of several
concentrations of resveratrol. The release of LDH in the cells
supernatants was measured using the LDH cytotoxicity detection
kit (Roche).
Establishment of EBV-positive Cells Lines Stably
Expressing an NFkB Luciferase Vector
The pGL4.32 [-luc2PNFkB –RE/Hygro] vector, designated as
NFkB-Luc, which contains five copies of an NFkB response
element and drives transcription of the luciferase reporter gene
was used to examine NFkB activity in EBV-infected cells lines.
The NFkB-Luc vector was transfected into two LCL cells using
the GenomONETM-Neo EX HVJ Envelope Transfection Kit
(Ishihara Sangyo, Tokyo Japan) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. Stable transfectants were established by selection with
hygromycin B (300 mg/ml).
NFkB -Luciferase Activation Assay
The cell lines stably expressing the NFkB-Luc vector were
cultured for 6 hrs in the presence or absence of variable
concentrations of resveratrol. Some cells were pretreated with
20 ng/ml of TNF-a to over activate NFkB signal. The cells were
harvested and lysed using the passive lysis buffer (Promega). The
luciferase activity in the lysates which represents NFkB activity was
quantified using a luciferase system (Promega) in a Mabskan LB
system (Thermo Scientific).

Western Blot Analysis
Whole-cell protein samples were prepared by lysing the cells in
M-PERH Mammalian Protein Extraction Reagent (Pierce) sup￾plemented with phosphatase and a protease inhibitor cocktail
(Sigma). Nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions were isolated using the
NE-PER kit (Pierce). Equal amounts of protein extracts were
separated by SDS–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS–
PAGE), and transferred to PVDF membranes (Millipore). Milk￾blocked blots were incubated at 4uC overnight with primary
antibodies and then incubated with appropriate horseradish
peroxidase conjugated secondary antibodies. The proteins of
interest were revealed using the WestPico chemiluminescence
system (Pierce) and viewed in a luminescent image analyzer Las￾400 mini (Fujifilm). Where indicated comparative blots intensities
were assessed using the Image J software (NIH, Bethesda, MD).
Flow Cytometry Analysis
B cells infected with EGFP-EBV were harvested at 12 hrs,
24 hrs, 48 hrs, 72 hrs, and 96 hrs post-infection and analyzed by
flow cytometry. Primary B cells infected with EBV and cultured
for 72 hours or primary B cells, that had been stimulated with
CD40L/IL-4 for 7 days, were collected and treated for 30 minutes
with TNF-a (20 ng/ml) to induce hyperactivation of NFKB or
with IL-10 to enhance STAT-3 activity. The cells were then
cultured for 6 hours in the presence or the absence resveratrol
(50 mM) and then were harvested and fixed with 4% para￾formaldehyde followed by permeabilization with 90% methanol
and staining with a PE labeled anti NFkB or an Alexa Fluor 488
labeled antibody that recognizes STAT-3 phosphorylation at Tyr￾705 (clone D3A7) or the corresponding isotype control antibodies
(Cell Signaling Technology). Flow cytometry was carried out on
a flow cytometry instrument using the Cell-Quest software
package (Becton-Dickinson, San Jose, CA). Data analysis was
performed using FlowJo software.
Cytokine Measurement
Purified B cells were infected with EBV and cultured for 48
hours. They were then plated at a density of 56105 cells/ml and
cultured for other 72 hrs in the presence or absence of resveratrol.
The levels of the EBV-related cytokines (IL-6 and IL-10) in the
culture supernatants were determined using the Multianalyte
Human Cytokine Assay kit (SAB-Qiagen) or using a specific
ELISA assay for IL-13 (Mabtech, Nacka Strand, Sweden).

Quantitative Real Time PCR
Total RNA was extracted using Tripure Isolation reagent
(Roche) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Complementa￾ry DNA (cDNA) synthesis was carried out using the QuantiTect
Reverse Transcription kit (Qiagen Inc. Hilden Germany) which
includes a DNAse treatment step to remove any traces of
contaminant genomic DNA. Amplification of cDNA was moni￾tored using the SYBR Premix Ex Taq RT-PCR kit (Catalog
RR041, Takara Bio, Japan) on a StepOne plus instrument
(Applied Biosystems). Specific primers for BHRF1 and EBNA-1
[20], and LMP1 [21], as well as a GAPDH primer set (Takara Bio)
were used for mRNA quantification in each sample. The amount
of each mRNA relative to GAPDH mRNA was calculated by the
comparative CT method using the relative expression function
included in the StepOne v2.2 software package (Applies
Biosystems). The time kinetics levels of BHRF1 transcripts in
EBV-infected B cells were normalized to the BHRF1 levels in
a lytic infected LCL and expressed as the percentage of the
control.
Measurement of microRNAs
Total RNA was reverse transcribed using a TaqMan micro￾RNA RT kit (Applied Biosystems) and the resultant cDNA was
amplified using specific TaqMan microRNA assays for human
miR-155 and U6B RNA with the TaqMan Universal PCR master
mix II no UNG (Applied Biosystems). The PCR reactions and
cycling parameters were set according to the manufacturer’s
recommendations. Specific miScript primer assays for human
miRNA-34a, miRNA-1245, miRNA-223 and U6B RNA, all from
Qiagen, were used to amplify cDNA samples that were prepared
from B cells derived total RNA using the miScript RT kit II
(Qiagen). The PCR reactions were carried out using the SYBR
Premix Ex Taq RT-PCR kit (Takara). The data analysis was
performed with the StepOne v2.2 software package (Applied

calculated using the comparative CT method after normalization
to the U6B RNA levels.
Statistical Analysis
All data are reported as the means6S.E. Statistical significance
was determined using Student’s t-test. The statistical significance of
multiple comparisons was determined using a one-way analysis of
variance. The data were considered to be statistically significant
when p#0.05. All statistical analyses were performed using the
GraphPad Prism software package (San Diego).
Results
Resveratrol Prevents the EBV-immortalization of Primary
Human B Cells
The ability of EBV to in vitro transform B cells in the presence of
resveratrol was examined. As shown in Fig. 1A, whereas EBV￾infected B cells were typically transformed in more than 90% of
the wells, resveratrol significantly decreased the transformation
efficiency of B cells in a dose dependent manner, ranging from less
than 30% of transformed wells in cells treated with 25 mM of
resveratrol to less than 5% in cells treated with 50 mM of
resveratrol. Resveratrol also impaired the transformation efficien￾cy in conditions under limited cell seeding (Fig. 1B) or limited
virus dose (Fig. 1C). Notably, the concentrations of resveratrol
that were effective in preventing EBV-immortalization of B cells
were not toxic to normal B cells, as demonstrated by similar levels
of LDH in the supernatants of uninfected B cells cultured for up to
72 hours in the presence or absence of resveratrol (Fig. 1D) and
by comparable proliferation rates in resveratrol-treated and
untreated B cells cultured in medium containing recombinant
CD40 ligands and IL-4 (Fig. 1E).
Resveratrol Induces Apoptosis in EBV-infected B Cells
PBMC or purified B cells were preincubated with resveratrol
and then infected with a recombinant EBV containing enhanced
green fluorescent protein gene in its genome (EGFP-EBV). The
EGFP-EBV-infected B cells were examined by flow cytometry at
several time points after infection to monitor the EBV infection
process. No significant differences in the percentage of EGFP
positive cells in resveratrol treated or untreated cells were observed
through the course of 72 hrs of monitoring purified infected B cells
(Fig. 2A), thus suggesting that resveratrol does not prevent the

EBV infection of B cells. However a large number of EBV-EGFP
infected B cells treated with resveratrol showed a bizarre shape
72 hrs after infection, and unlike the resveratrol nonexposed cells
that formed EGFP-LCLs by three weeks after infection, resver￾atrol-treated B cells failed to immortalize B cells. Next, purified B
cells infected with EGFP-EBV were harvested at 48 and 72 hrs
after infection and the number of apoptotic cells in the EGFP￾positive (EBV-infected) cell fraction were determined by flow
cytometry. Resveratrol induced apoptosis in EGFP-EBV-infected
B cells in a dose-dependent (Fig. 2B) and time-dependent
(Fig. 2C) manner, thus suggesting that the anti-EBV effect of
resveratrol is mediated by inducing apoptosis in the infected B
cells. Since cytokines such as IL-6 and IL-10 contribute to EBV￾infected cell survival and proliferation indefinitely [22], culture
supernatants of EBV-infected B cells treated with or without
resveratrol were assessed for the expression of those and other
cytokines. Compared with their untreated counterparts, EBV￾infected B cells treated with resveratrol secreted lower levels of
EBV-related cytokines such as IL-13 (Fig. 2D top panel), as well
as lower levels of IL-6 and IL-10 (Fig. 2D bottom panel), thus
indicating that resveratrol interfered with the secretion of
cytokines, which play a critical role in the survival and pro￾liferation of EBV-infected cells.
Resveratrol Inhibits the EBV-induced Activation of the
NFkB Pathway
The potential inhibition of NFkB activity by resveratrol in EBV￾infected cells was investigated since activation of the NFkB
pathway is critical for the EBV-transformation of human B cells
[23] and resveratrol is an effective NFkB inhibitor in several
cellular systems [10,11]. EBV-immortalized LCLs carrying
a luciferase reporter vector, whose activity is detectable only in
the presence of active NFkB, were established. Fig. 3A shows that
TNF-a-induced hyperactivation of NFkB in LCL cells was
abrogated by the exposure of these cells to resveratrol. Resveratrol
was added to bulk B cells 72 hrs post-infection and the activation
status of NFkB was determined by flow cytometry using an
antibody specific to phosphorylated p65, a functionally active
subunit of NFkB. Resveratrol suppressed both the constitutively
active NFkB and the TNF-a-induced hyperactivation of NFkB in
EBV-infected B cells (Fig. 3B). In addition, resveratrol induced
a dose dependent decrease in the nuclear translocation of p65
NFkB in EBV-infected B cells (Fig. 3C). Taken together these
results indicate that the prevention of the EBV-immortalization of
human B cells by resveratrol is therefore associated with the
inhibition of NFkB.
Resveratrol Inhibits the EBV-induced Activation of the
STAT-3 Pathway in B Cells
The effect of resveratrol on the activation state of STAT-3 was
investigated in EBV-infected B cells, since STAT-3 signal
activation is implicated in the EBV-mediated oncogenesis [24],
and previous studies have shown that resveratrol is an effective
STAT-3 inhibitor [25,26]. Whole-cell protein extracts were
collected from EBV-infected B cells at 72 hrs after infection and
assayed by Western blotting, with antibodies specific to phosphor￾Figure 5. Resveratrol inhibits the expression of viral-induced anti-apoptotic genes in EBV-infected B cells. (A) Primary B cells were

ylated STAT-3 at Tyr 705. Constitutively active STAT-3 was
detected in these cells and their exposure to resveratrol resulted in
a dose dependent (Fig. 4A) and time dependent (Fig. 4B) down￾regulation of phosphorylated STAT-3. The inhibitory activity of
resveratrol on constitutively active STAT-3 signaling as well as on
the IL-10 induced STAT-3 hyperactivation was also demonstrated
using flow cytometry with an antibody specific to phosphorylated
STAT-3 (Fig. 4C). Interestingly, although resveratrol suppressed
the IL-10 induced STAT-3 hyperactivation in CD40L/IL-4
stimulated B cells, it showed no inhibitory effect on the
constitutively active STAT-3 in those cells (Fig. S1B).
Whole-cell protein extracts from EBV-infected B cells were
probed with antibodies specific to Mcl-1 and survivin, since the
anti-apoptotic proteins Survivin and Mcl-1, which are downstream
of STAT-3 signal activation, are implicated in the survival of
EBV-infected malignant cells [24,27] and resveratrol have been
reported to inhibit the expression of anti-apoptotic proteins in
other cellular systems [25]. Resveratrol considerably inhibited the
expression of Survivin and Mcl-1 in EBV-infected B cells
(Fig. 4D). These results suggested that the inhibition of STAT-3
and its cascade are involved in the anti-EBV activities mediated by
resveratrol. Notably, the expressions of Mcl-1 and survivin
proteins in CD40L/IL-4 stimulated B cells were not significantly
affected by the resveratrol treatment (Fig. S1C).
Resveratrol Blocks the Expression of Viral Anti-apoptotic
Genes in EBV-infected B Cells
The effect of resveratrol on the expression of BHRF1, an EBV￾encoded homolog of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2, was
investigated, since the early expression of BHRF1 is critical for
EBV-transformation of B cells [4]. Quantitative RT-PCR showed
that while BHRF1 transcripts were detectable 24 hrs after
infection, BHRF1 transcripts were not detectable in resveratrol
exposed cells (Fig. 5A), thus indicating that blocking the BHRF1
expression may contribute to the pro-apoptotic properties of
resveratrol in EBV-infected B cells. Additional experiments were
performed in which resveratrol was started 72 hours after EBV
infection and then BHRF1 transcripts levels were measured 24
hours after resveratrol treatment, to rule out the possibility that the
absence of BHRF1 mRNAs in resveratrol treated cells was
a property of cells undergoing apoptosis and not a specific effect of
the polyphenol. Fig. 5B shows that resveratrol significantly
decreased the BHFR1 transcripts, in a dose dependent manner.
In addition, recent reports have shown that EBV infection induces
the cellular over-expression of miR-155 and this event is critical
for the EBV-transformation of B cells [28,29] and resveratrol
decreases the levels of miR-155 in monocytic cells [30]. Therefore,
the effect of resveratrol on the expression of miR-155 was
investigated in EBV-infected B cells. Quantitative RT-PCR

showed that EBV infection significantly augmented miR-155
expression in B cells at levels that were highest by 72 hrs post￾infection. Exposure of EBV-infected B cells to resveratrol however,
prevented such a viral-induced miR-155 upregulation (Fig. 5C).
The levels of other lymphocyte-expressed miRNAs such as miR￾1245 [31] and miR-223 [32] were not significantly affected by
resveratrol treatment. Surprisingly, the levels of miR-34a, which
was recently reported to promote the growing of EBV-transformed
B cells [33], were significantly reduced in the resveratrol treated
infected B cells (Fig. S2). In addition, resveratrol significantly
decreased the levels of miR-155 and miR-34a in EBV-immortal￾ized LCLs in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 5D), thus indicating
that the inhibition of EBV-induced over-expression of miR-155
and miR-34a by resveratrol was an important event that
contributed to preventing the EBV-immortalization of B cells.
Resveratrol Decreases the Expression of LMP1 and
Induced Apoptosis in EBV-transformed B Cells
LMP1 is the most important oncogenic protein of EBV and is
absolutely required for B cells immortalization [2]. PBMC infected
with EBV were cultured with or without resveratrol and harvested
at several time points after infection. The expression of LMP1
transcripts was determined by quantitative RT-PCR. LMP1
transcripts were detectable by 48 hrs after EBV infection and
they remained at high levels for up to 5 days post-infection, as
reported elsewhere [34]. Remarkably, resveratrol induced a dose
dependent reduction of the LMP1 transcripts (Fig. 6A) and
significantly decreased the expression of LMP1 proteins in EBV￾infected B cells (Fig. 6B). In addition, resveratrol treatment also
resulted in a decrease in the LMP1 expression at both the
transcriptional (Fig. 6C) and the protein level (Fig. 6D) in EBV￾immortalized LCLs. Conversely, resveratrol treatment caused no
changes in the expression of other relevant EBV products
including EBNA1 (Fig. 6E) and EBNA2 (Fig. 6F), indicating
that LMP1 represents an important target mediating the anti-EBV
effects of resveratrol.
Consistent with these findings, resveratrol significantly inhibited
the proliferation (Fig. 7A) and induced a dose-dependent (Fig. 7B)
and time-dependent apoptosis (Fig. 7C) in three EBV-immortal￾ized LCLs. It may be noted, that the number of apoptotic cells
were relatively low in cells treated with resveratrol for 24 hours but
it increased dramatically after 48 hours of culture. Taken together,
these results indicate that resveratrol may have not only pre￾ventive, but also therapeutic, properties against EBV-related
malignancies.
Discussion
Resveratrol is a potent chemopreventive agent with in vivo and
in vitro proved efficacy against a broad spectrum of malignant cells
[10]. This report presents a comprehensive study of the anti-EBV
activities of resveratrol. The data showed that resveratrol
effectively interrupted the immortalization process associated with
EBV infection in human B cells and consistently attenuated the
proliferation of EBV-transformed B cells. Mechanistic studies
showed that such an inhibitory effect of resveratrol on the EBV￾Figure 7. Resveratrol causes cell cycle arrest and induces apoptosis in EBV-immortalized B cells. (A) EBV-immortalized LCLs were

associated immortalization was mediated by inducing apoptosis in
the EBV infected B cells. Resveratrol inhibited the expression of
key EBV genes and blocked viral-induced cellular signals that are
essential for the transformation, survival and proliferation of EBV￾infected B cells thus; resulting in the apoptosis of the EBV-infected
B cells.
EBV uses various strategies to manipulate cellular signal of the
host that promotes the survival and the indefinitely proliferation of
the EBV-infected B cells. EBV expresses several viral genes during
the immortalization process with growth-transforming activity.
LMP1 is particularly important because it is a classic oncogenic
protein [2] and is indispensable for the EBV-transformation of B
cells [3]. Remarkably, resveratrol inhibited the expression of
LMP1 gene in EBV-infected primary B cells and consistently
down-regulated LMP1 at both the protein and transcriptional
levels in EBV-immortalized LCLs. This finding are relevant for
understanding the anti-EBV mechanism of resveratrol, since
LMP1 functions as a homologue of the constitutively active CD40
receptor and activates NFkB, AKT and STAT-3 [35–37], which
are pathways involved in the regulation of apoptosis cell pro￾liferation. Notably, the activation of these cascades, particularly
NFkB and STAT-3, is necessary for the EBV-immortalization of B
cells and is required for the proliferation of EBV-related
malignancies [35,37]. Previous studies showed that resveratrol is
an effective inhibitor of the NFkB and STAT-3 pathways, which
represents an important mechanism mediating the antitumor
properties of this polyphenol [10,11]. Therefore, it is conceivable
that the effective inactivation of NFkB and STAT-3 signals by
resveratrol in EBV-infected B cells, occurring as a direct effect of
the drug on these targets or as an indirect event associated with the
downregulation of LMP1 induced by resveratrol, might account
for the efficacy of this polyphenol preventing EBV-immortaliza￾tion of B cells.
LMP1-dependent activation of NFkB in EBV-infected host cells
leads to the production of cytokines including IL-6, IL-8 and IL-10
that contributes to the survival and proliferation of the infected B
cells [38]. The present study demonstrated that resveratrol
suppressed the secretion of IL-6 and IL-10 in EBV-infected B
cells and EBV-immortalized LCLs exposed to resveratrol secreted
significant less IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-a than the untreated cells.
These events, which appear to be a consequence of the NFkB
inactivation induced by resveratrol, may further create a unique
microenvironment that does not favor the immortalization and
proliferation of the EBV-infected B cells.
A recent report demonstrated the essential role of the viral
product BHRF1 in the EBV-transformation of B cells [4]. BHRF1
codes for a homologue of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 which is
highly expressed initially after infection. The very early post￾infection expression prevents EBV-infected B cells from sponta￾neous apoptosis and promotes the cellular transformation [4]. The
current data revealed that EBV-infected B cells treated with
resveratrol failed to express BHRF1 indicating that the blockade of
BHRF1 expression is an important mechanism used by resveratrol
to promote the apoptosis in infected cells, thus preventing the
EBV-immortalization of B cells.
EBV-encoded LMP1 upregulates the expression of miR-155
through activating the NFkB pathway which interacts with the
promoter region of the miR-155 primary transcript [28], hence
EBV infection of primary B lymphocytes leads to a sustained
elevation of miR-155 and this virally-induced cellular micro RNA
miR-155 plays key role in immortalization of B cells by EBV and is
essential for the survival of newly generated LCLs [29]. A recent
study reported that miR-34a, which is also induced by LMP1 via
NFkB activation, promotes the growth of EBV transformed B cells
[33]. Therefore, the effective blockade of virally induced miR-34a
and miR-155 in infected primary B cells and the downregulation
of these miRNAs in LCLs may account for the anti-EBV efficacy
of resveratrol. Furthermore, resveratrol-induced downregulation
of miR-155 has therapeutic implications given the oncogenic
potential of miR-155 and its critical role in rapidly growing EBV￾related malignancies such as post-transplant lymphoproliferative
disorders [29,39].
EBV has been etiologically linked to a wide spectrum of
malignant diseases [3]. The oncogenic potential of EBV is mainly
due to the expression of the LMP1 viral oncogene that functionally
mimics CD40 signal activation and elicits powerful proliferative
stimuli in the target cells [2,37] Recently, De Leo et al. reported
that resveratrol inhibits the proliferation and survival of EBV￾infected Burkitt’s lymphoma cells [40]. These effects were found to
be mediated through the inhibition of NFkB and were mitigated to
some extent by the latency III EBV. Interestingly, the expression
of LMP1 in target cells greatly confers resistance to resveratrol￾induced cytotoxicity [40]. In line with those observations, we
found that LCLs were resistant to resveratrol during 24 hours of
culture; however, resveratrol exerted a robust cytotoxicity against
those cells after 48 hours of culture, indicating that a relatively long
exposure to the drug is required to eliminate LCLs. It is thus
conceivable that by downregulating LMP1 expression in LCLs,
resveratrol may overcome the resistance of those cells. Accord￾ingly, reducing the expression of LMP1 with resveratrol might
enhance anti-tumor activity in the treatment of LMP1+ EBV￾associated B cell malignancies, including Hodgkin’s lymphoma,
immunoblastic lymphoma and nasopharyngeal carcinoma. In￾deed, the chemosensitization of tumors by resveratrol has been
demonstrated in other malignancies and is currently under clinical
investigation [26].
Resveratrol is virtually non-toxic in humans. Phase I clinical
trials have shown resveratrol to be safe and well tolerated at a dose
of up to 5 g/day and there are currently more than 20 ongoing
clinical trials of resveratrol [41–43]. The mean maximal plasma
concentrations (Cmax) and half-life times (T1/2) of resveratrol (and
its active metabolites) in healthy volunteers receiving resveratrol at
a daily dose of 5 g were 50 mM and 8 hours, respectively [42]. The
effects of resveratrol were significant at concentrations of 25 mM
or more in the present in vitro study, thus resveratrol is considered
to be a clinically promising option to prevent EBV–related B-cell
proliferation in HSCT or SOT recipients, especially in those with
risk factors for the development of PTLD [1], such as EBV￾seronegative recipients and/or donors, lung or heart-lung trans￾plant recipients, those receiving antithymocyte globulin (ATG) or
those exhibiting cytomegalovirus disease, T-cell depletion or HLA￾mismatching. Patients with an impaired T-cell function, such as
those with aplastic anemia treated with ATG and those with
primary immunodeficiency, may be alternative candidates for this
strategy. Moreover, the observation that resveratrol efficiently
eliminates EBV-infected cells by inhibiting the anti-apoptosis
pathway of EBV suggests that resveratrol, in combination with
currently available therapies, could enhance the effective treat￾ment of EBV-related cancers, including Hodgkin’s lymphoma,
Burkitt’s lymphoma, diffuse large B cell lymphoma, nasopharyn￾geal carcinoma and chronic diseases such as chronic EBV
infection or multiple sclerosis [44].
