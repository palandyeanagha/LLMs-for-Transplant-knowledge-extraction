Abstract
Background: Fabry disease is a rare X linked lysosomal storage
disorder resulting from deficiency of α-galactosidase A activity.
Although the severity of clinical features in male patients is well
described, only recently have studies reported the high prevalence
of disabling clinical features in heterozygous females.
Aims: This study sets out to examine the clinical features and
natural history of Fabry disease in further detail in a large group of
female patients.
Methods: Data were obtained from 303 females enrolled in the
Fabry Outcome Survey. Pain was assessed using the Brief Pain
Inventory, and health related quality of life (HRQoL) was assessed
using the European Quality of Life Questionnaire. A modified
version of the Mainz Severity Score Index was also applied. Data on
left ventricular mass (LVM) index, mean ventricular wall thickness,
and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) were used to assess cardiac and
renal involvement.
Results: The most commonly reported clinical features in females
were neurological (77%) and cardiac (59%). A history of renal
involvement was recorded in 40% of cases. Neurological features
were the earliest to develop (mean age: 16 years), whereas cardiac
(mean age: 33.5 years) and renal (mean age: 37.3 years) features
developed later. LVM index increased exponentially with age. In
addition, age was negatively correlated with estimated GFR and
HRQoL.
Conclusions: Females with Fabry disease report important age


related clinical features and clinical investigation demonstrates
evidence of disease progression. This study highlights the
importance of careful and longitudinal assessment of female
heterozygote patients with Fabry disease.
