Abstract
BACKGROUND The interrelationship between human airway
epithelium and complement proteins may affect airway defence,
airway function, and airway epithelial integrity. A study was
undertaken to determine (1) whether unstimulated human
bronchial epithelium generates complement proteins and expresses
cell membrane complement inhibitory proteins (CIP) and (2)
whether stimulation by proinflammatory cytokines affects the
generation of complement and expression of cell membrane CIP by
these cells.
METHODS Human bronchial epithelium cell line BEAS-2B was
cultured in a serum-free medium. Cells were incubated with and
without proinflammatory cytokines to assess unstimulated and
stimulated generation of complement C3, C1q and C5 (by ELISA),
and to examine the expression of cell membrane CIP decay
accelerating factor (DAF; CD55), membrane cofactor protein (MCP;
CD46), and CD59 (protectin) by flow cytometry analysis.
RESULTS Unstimulated human bronchial epithelial cell line
BEAS-2B in serum-free medium generates complement C3 (mean 32 
ng/106 cells/72 h, range 18–52) but not C1q and C5, and expresses
cell membrane DAF, MCP, and CD59. Interleukin (IL)-1α (100 U/
ml/72 h) and tumour necrosis factor (TNF-α; 1000 U/ml/72 h)
increased generation of C3 up to a mean of 78% and 138%,
respectively, above C3 generation by unstimulated cells. DAF was
the only cell membrane CIP affected by cytokine stimulation.
Interferon (IFN)-γ (10 U/ml/72 h) and TNF-α (1000 U/ml/72 h)
increased DAF expression up to a mean of 116% and 45%,
respectively, above that in unstimulated cells. MCP and CD59
expression was not consistently affected by IL-1α, TNF-α, or IFN-γ.
CONCLUSIONS Local generation of complement C3 and expression
of cell membrane CIP by human bronchial epithelium and its
modulation by proinflammatory cytokines might be an additional
regulatory mechanism of local airway defence and may affect
airway function and epithelial integrity in health and disease.
