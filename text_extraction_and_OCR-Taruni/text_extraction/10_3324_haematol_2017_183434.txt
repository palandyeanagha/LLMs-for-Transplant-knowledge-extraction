Abstract
We conducted a phase 2 study in which patients undergoing
allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation received


tocilizumab in addition to standard immune suppression with
tacrolimus and methotrexate for graft-versus-host disease
prophylaxis. Thirty-five patients were enrolled between January
2015 and June 2016. The median age of the cohort was 66 (range:
22-76). All patients received busulfan-based conditioning, and were
transplanted with human leukocyte antigen-matched related or
matched unrelated bone marrow or peripheral stem cell grafts. The
cumulative incidences of grades II-IV and III-IV acute graft-versus-
host disease were 14% (95% CI 5-30) and 3% (95% CI 0-11) at day
100, and 17% (95% CI 7-31) and 6% (95% CI 1-16) at day 180,
respectively. Notably, there were no cases of graft-versus-host
disease of the lower gastrointestinal tract within the first 100 days.
A comparison to 130 matched controls who only received
tacrolimus and methotrexate demonstrated a lower cumulative
incidence of grades II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (17% versus
45%, P=0.003) and a significant increase in grades II-IV acute
graft-versus-host disease-free survival at six months (69% versus
42%, P=0.001) with tocilizumab, tacrolimus and methotrexate,
which was the primary endpoint of the study. Immune
reconstitution was preserved in patients treated with tocilizumab,
tacrolimus and methotrexate, as T-cell and B-cell subsets recovered
to near normal levels by 6-12 months post-transplantation. We
conclude that tocilizumab has promising activity in preventing
acute graft-versus-host disease, particularly in the lower
gastrointestinal tract, and warrants examination in a randomized
setting.
Introduction
Graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) is the major complication arising
from allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).
GvHD is characterized by the overproduction of proinflammatory
cytokines that induce target organ damage directly, or indirectly by
activating other effector cell populations.31 Interleukin 6 (IL-6) has
emerged as an inflammatory cytokine that plays a pivotal role in
the pathophysiology of GvHD and has become a potential
therapeutic target.64 Preclinical studies have demonstrated that
IL-6 levels are increased early during GvHD and are present in all
target tissues.7 Moreover, blockade of the IL-6 signaling pathway


using an antibody that binds to the IL-6 receptor has been shown to
reduce the severity of GvHD and prolong survival in pre-clinical
murine models.87 In particular, IL-6 appears to have an important
pathophysiological role in promoting inflammation in the
gastrointestinal (GI) tract,7 which is a major cause of morbidity and
mortality during GvHD.
The importance of IL-6 in human GvHD is supported by studies
which have shown that patients with elevated plasma levels of
IL-6,109 as well as those with a recipient or donor IL-6 genotype
which results in increased IL-6 production,1411 have an increased
incidence and severity of this disease. The Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) approval of tocilizumab (Toc; Actemra™),
which is a humanized anti-IL-6 receptor antibody that blocks both
the membrane and soluble forms of the receptor for the treatment
of severe active rheumatoid arthritis,1615 has allowed off-label use
of this agent to determine whether blockade of IL-6 signaling
attenuates GvHD. To that end, it was demonstrated that Toc
induced clinical responses in patients with steroid refractory acute
(a)GvHD that primarily involved the lower GI tract.17 Furthermore,
the addition of Toc to standard immune suppression resulted in a
low incidence of aGvHD in a patient population which was
comprised primarily of myeloid maligananices,18 providing
evidence that inhibition of IL-6 might also be an effective approach
for the prevention of GvHD. Notably, however, in the latter study
myeloablative (MA) conditioning was carried out exclusively with
total body irradiation (TBI) and cyclophosphamide (Cy), which is
not a widely employed regimen for the treatment of myeloid
malignancies. Since the intensity of the conditioning regimen is
known to affect the magnitude of inflammatory cytokine
production,19 the relevance of these results to patients treated with
alternative, more commonly utilized conditioning regimens is not
clear. Furthermore, there was no corresponding demographically-
matched control population against which to assess these results.
In the study herein, we sought to determine whether the addition of
Toc to standard immune suppression was effective for the
prevention of aGvHD in patients who received busulfan (Bu)-based
conditioning regimens, with particular emphasis given to the lower
GI tract given prior pre-clinical studies and the primacy of this


organ in GvHD pathophysiology. To place our results in context, we
interrogated the Center for International Blood and Marrow
Transplant Research (CIBMTR) database to obtain a control
population that was matched for relevant demographic and
transplant characteristics. We also examined longitudinal immune
reconstitution and inflammatory cytokine production as additional
parameters by which to assess the effect of IL-6 inhibition in
transplant recipients.
Methods
Patient population
Patients were eligible for this trial if they met the following criteria:
age >18 years; a diagnosis of acute leukemia, chronic myelogenous
leukemia, myeloproliferative disease, myelodysplasia with less than
5% of blasts in the bone marrow, or a diagnosis of chronic
lymphocytic leukemia, non-Hodgkin lymphoma or Hodgkin
lymphoma with chemosensitive disease; availability of a 10/10
matched sibling or 8/8 matched unrelated donor; ejection fraction
at rest >45% for MA conditioning or >40% for reduced intensity
conditioning (RIC); estimated creatinine clearance greater than 50
mL/minute; adjusted diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide
(DLCO) ≥40% and forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1)
≥50%; and total bilirubin < 1.5 × and alanine transaminase
(ALT)/aspartate transaminase (AST) < 2.5× the upper normal
limit. Patients were excluded if they had had a prior allogeneic
HSCT, Karnofsky Performance Score <70%, uncontrolled bacterial,
viral or fungal infections at time of enrollment, prior intolerance or
allergy to Toc, use of rituximab, alemtuzumab, antithymocyte
globulin (ATG) or other monoclonal antibody at time of
conditioning regimen, or history of diverticulitis, Crohn’s disease,
ulcerative colitis or a demyelinating disorder.
Control population
The control population was derived from cases reported to the
CIBMTR.20 Eligibility criteria for the control cohort consisted of
having received a first allogeneic transplant at an American center,


excluding The Medical College of Wisconsin (MCW), and meeting
the same eligibility as the study population, with the exception of
receiving only tacrolimus (Tac)/methotrexate (MTX) as GvHD
prophylaxis. Controls were selected from the years 2010-2015. This
selection process resulted in the screening of 1,442 patients to
define an optimally-matched control cohort.
Conditioning regimens and GvHD prophylaxis
All patients received Bu as part of the preparative regimen. Patients
receiving MA conditioning were treated with either Bu 3.2 mg/kg/
day (days −7 to −4) and Cy 60 mg/kg/day (days −3 and −2) or
Bu 3.2 mg/kg/day (days 5- to −2) and fludarabine (Flu) 30 mg/m/
day (days −5 to −2). Bu dosing was modified after the fifth dose,
if necessary, to achieve a targeted level of 900±100 ng/mL. RIC
was with Flu 30 mg/m/day (days −6 to −2) and Bu 3.2 mg/kg/
day (days −5 and −4). Patients received either T-cell replete bone
marrow or granulocyte colony factor-stimulated peripheral blood
stem cell grafts. For GvHD prevention, Tac was administered
intravenously at a dose of 0.03 mg/kg/day starting on day – 3 to
maintain a level of 5-15 ng/mL. MTX was given at the doses of 15
mg/m IV on day +1, and 10 mg/m IV on days +3, +6 and +11
after hematopoietic stem cell infusion. Toc was infused
intravenously at a dose of 8 mg/kg (maximum dose of 800 mg)
once on day-1 approximately 24 hours prior to the hematopoietic
stem cell infusion, as per Kennedy and colleagues.18
Study design
The primary objective of this study was to compare the probability
of grades II-IV aGvHD-free survival at day 180 post-transplant
between recipients of Toc, Tac and MTX and a contemporary
control population who received Tac/MTX-based GvHD
prophylaxis. Pre-specified secondary objectives of the study were to
compare chronic (c)GvHD, transplant related mortality (TRM),
disease relapse or progression, disease-free survival (DFS) and
overall survival (OS) between Toc/Tac/MTX and Tac/MTX CIBMTR
controls. Online Supplementary Table S1 contains the definition of
the events, censorings, and competing risks for all time-to-event
outcomes. Additionally, secondary objectives included description


of the incidence of grades ≥3 toxicities according to Common
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Event (CTACAE) v4, neutrophil
and platelet engraftment, characterization of infections, proportion
of donor chimerism, extent of immune reconstitution, and
production of proinflammatory cytokines among patients who
received Toc/Tac/MTX. A population that consisted of patients who
were otherwise eligible for the trial but did not receive Toc in
addition to Tac/MTX for GvHD prophylaxis was employed as a
control for the cytokine analysis. These patients were consented and
enrolled on a separate study. Both protocols were approved by the
Institutional Review Board at the MCW.
Outcome assessments
Neutrophil recovery was defined as the first of three consecutive
days with an absolute neutrophil count (ANC)>500. Platelet
engraftment was defined as the first day of a sustained platelet
count above 20,000 without any platelet transfusions for the
preceding seven days. Five patients who received reduced intensity
transplants never dropped their platelet count below 20,000. In
these patients, the date of platelet recovery was defined as the first
day that the platelet count increased after its nadir. The grade of
aGvHD was determined using the Glucksberg scale.21 cGvHD was
graded using the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Chronic GvHD
Consensus criteria.22
Statistical analysis
The probabilities of DFS, aGvHD-free survival, and OS were
calculated using the Kaplan-Meier estimator. The probabilities of
neutrophil and platelet engraftment, TRM, disease progression/
relapse, and aGvHD and cGvHD were calculated using the
cumulative incidence estimator. GvHD was calculated using disease
progression/relapse or death as competing risks. Matching criteria
for controls consisted of age within 5 years; performance score
(≥90 vs. <90); Bu-based regimen (Flu/Bu reduced intensity, Bu/Cy
MA, or Flu/Bu MA); disease, and donor type (human leukocyte
antigen [HLA]-matched sibling vs. HLA-matched unrelated donor).
Up to four matches per case were selected whenever possible; when
more controls were available preference was given to identical stem


cell source (bone marrow, peripheral blood) and closest age. With
respect to stem cell source, 124 of the 135 CIBMTR control patients
were also matched for this variable. The follow up of the control
patients was administratively censored at 22 months, which
corresponded to the longest follow up of the trial patients. With 35
patients enrolled in the trial and 140 controls, there was an 80%
power to detect an improvement of 20% on day 180 aGvHD-free
survival. The outcomes were compared between groups using a
stratified log-rank test or Gray’s test for survival and competing risk
outcomes, respectively, with matched sets defining strata. Stratified
Cox or Fine-Gray regression was used to obtain hazard ratios with
95% confidence intervals. Each cytokine was analyzed separately in
the combined sample, and by conditioning regimen (ablative vs.
RIC). Cytokine values were shifted by half of the smallest nonzero
value and then log-transformed to improve normality of the
residuals. First, a separate analysis was conducted for each
treatment group (Toc and Control) followed by a joint analysis. A
repeated measures analysis was performed using a mixed effects
model with a random subject-specific intercept to incorporate
within-subject dependence. All time-points were compared to the
baseline value with Dunnett-Hsu adjustment for multiple testing.
The estimates were back-transformed to the original scale for
reporting.
Other detailed methods
Serum cytokine and immune reconstitution analyses are described
in Online Supplementary Methods.
Results
Patient characteristics
From January 29, 2015 to June 30, 2016, 35 patients were enrolled
in the study. The demographic data for this population is detailed in
Table 1. The median age of the cohort was 66 (range: 22-76).
Diseases consisted of de novo acute myeloid leukemia (AML; n=14),
acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL; n=4), secondary or therapy-
related AML (n=5), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS; n=3),


chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML; n=5), myelofibrosis
(n=1), T-cell lymphoma (n=1), chronic myeloid leukemia (CML;
n=1), and natural killer (NK)/T-cell lymphoma (n=1). The disease
status of patients with acute and chronic leukemia are further
specified in Table 1. Four of the 14 patients with AML in first
remission had FLT3/ITD mutations, two additional recipients had
evidence of minimal residual disease at the time of transplant, and
another patient had a monosomal karyotype. All three patients with
ALL in complete remission 1 (CR1) were Philadelphia chromosome
positive. Using the adjusted disease risk index,23 patients were
classified as low (n=4), intermediate (n=22), or high (n=9) risk.

Engraftment and chimerism
There were no cases of graft rejection. The median time to an
ANC>500 was 18 days (range: 14-26) (Figure 1A). Twenty-one
patients received granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) for
1-3 days on days 14-19 post-transplantation to accelerate white
blood cell (WBC) recovery. The platelet count in five patients never
dropped below 20,000. Two additional patients died before
achieving engraftment of platelets. In the remaining patients, the
median time to platelet engraftment was 17 days (range: 10-103)
(Figure 1B). Chimerism studies conducted on day 28 post-
transplantation were available for 33 patients. Median donor CD3
chimerism was 88% (range: 34-100), while median CD33
chimerism was 100% (range: 97-100). Day 100 studies were
performed in 27 patients and revealed a median donor CD3
chimerism of 91% (range: 43-100) and CD33 chimerism of 100%
(range: 91-100).

GvHD, transplant-related mortality, relapse, and
survival
The cumulative incidence of grades II-IV aGvHD at days 100 and
180 was 14% (95% CI 5-30%) and 17% (95% CI 7-35%),
respectively, (Figure 1C). The incidence of grades III-IV aGvHD at
these same time points was 3% (95% CI 0-11%) and 6% (95% CI
1-16), respectively, (Figure 1D). All patients who developed ≥
grade II aGvHD within the first 100 days had isolated involvement
of the skin or upper GI tract. Three patients had GvHD of the skin,
one of whom developed grade IV disease, which proved to be fatal.
Three patients had upper GI tract involvement, which was resolved
in each case with modest doses of steroids. There were no cases of
aGvHD involving the liver or lower GI tract within this time
interval. One patient did develop grade II-IV aGvHD involving the
lower GI tract between days 100-180 post-transplantation. A second
patient with a prior history of overall grade III skin involvement
developed upper GI tract disease in the duodenum on day 177. The
cumulative incidence of grades II-IV aGvHD for each individual
tissue site is shown in Online Supplementary Figure S1. There was no
difference in the incidence of grades II-IV aGvHD at day 180
between patients who received MA (17%, 95% CI 4-37) versus
reduced intensity (18%, 95% CI 4-39) conditioning regimens
(Figure 1E). The median time to onset for aGvHD in recipients of
MA versus reduced intensity transplants was 44 and 78 days,
respectively. The incidence of cGvHD at 12 months was 38% (95%
CI 21-55) in this patient population (Figure 1F). The median follow
up for surviving patients was 15 months. TRM was 14% (95% CI
5-28) at 12 months and was attributable to GvHD (n=3), sepsis


(n=1), aspergillus pneumonia (n=1), idiopathic pneumonia
syndrome (n=1), and respiratory failure (n=1). The one-year
cumulative incidence of relapse was 29% (95% CI 15-44). DFS and
OS at 12 months was 57% (95% CI 42-70) and 68% (95% CI
53-79), respectively, (Figures 1G,H).
Side effects and infectious complications
There were no infusion-related reactions associated with the
administration of Toc. The major immediate Toc-associated side
effect within the first 28 days post-transplantation was the
development of grade III liver toxicity. Nine patients (26%) had ≥
grade III ALT elevations, two patients (6%) had ≥ grade III AST
levels and one patient had a grade IV bilirubin elevation.
Transaminase elevations typically peaked 7-10 days after infusion,
and were transient in all patients, eventually returning to baseline.
The marked bilirubin level in one patient was ascribed to total
parenteral nutrition administration after a biopsy revealed no
evidence of GvHD or any other underlying pathology. No patient
developed veno-occlusive disease of the liver. A total of 23 grade III
or higher infectious complications were observed in 13 patients
during the first 100 days. Fifteen of these were due to bacterial
infections, of which 11 were bloodstream (staphylococcus
epidermidis [n=6], bacillus cereus [n=1], strep oralis [n=1], strep
mitis [n=1], polymicrobial sepsis [n=1], vancomycin-resistant
enterococcus [n=1]), two urinary tract (staphylococcus epidermidis
[n=1], vancomycin-resistant enterococcus [n=1]), one respiratory
(staphylococcus epidermidis), and one attributable to clostridium
difficile. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation occurred in two of 12
(17%) seropositive recipients. Other viral infections consisted of
human herpes virus 6 (HHV-6) encephalitis (n=1), enterovirus
(n=1), and BK virus (n=3). One patient developed invasive
aspergillus pneumonia.
Inflammatory cytokine analyses
To examine how the administration of Toc altered inflammatory
cytokine production, we assayed serum cytokine levels (IL-2, IL-4,
IL-6, IL-10, IL-17A, tumor necrosis factor α [TNF-α] and interferon
g [IFN-g]) and soluble (s)IL-6R levels in the peripheral blood of


patients who received Toc (n=35) as well as a control population
(n=11) which had the same trial eligibility criteria, but did not
receive this agent (see patient demographics in Online Supplementary
Table S2). In the control population, we observed that IL-6 was the
only cytokine that was increased above baseline during the first 28
days (i.e., nine-fold increase on day 14 post-transplantation) (Figure
2). Conversely, sIL-6R levels were significantly decreased on days
seven and 14 before rebounding back to baseline on day 28. In the
Toc cohort, IL-6 levels were increased in patients who received Toc
at days seven, 14, and 28 when compared to baseline (Figure 3A).
Levels were augmented above baseline in both MA and RIC
recipients (Figure 3A), although IL-6 concentrations were higher in
patients who received ablative compared to reduced intensity
regimens on days seven and 14, but not day 28 (Online
Supplementary Figure S2A). sIL-6R levels were also significantly
increased beginning on day seven post-transplantation, and were
still elevated by day 28 (Figure 3B). Levels were augmented in
recipients of reduced intensity as opposed to MA regimens on day
14, but otherwise there were no differences at other time points
(Online Supplementary Figure S2B). Of the other cytokines measured
in the blood, marginal increases were observed in IL-2 at day seven
and IL-10 at day 28 (Online Supplementary Figure S3). A direct
comparison of cytokine levels between control and Toc-treated
patients demonstrated a marked increase in IL-6 and sIL-6R levels in
the latter group at all time points (Figure 4). There were also
significant but very modest decreases in IL-2, IL-4 and IL-10 in these
patients.

Immune reconstitution
Patients were tested by multi-parameter flow cytometry for
reconstitution of lymphocytes and major lymphocyte subsets (CD3,
CD4, and CD8 T cells, B cells, and NK cells) at four intervals over
the first year (Figure 5A,B). Patients recovered lymphocyte subsets
to, or near, healthy control levels between six months and one year
post-transplant, except for NK cells, which recovered early. The
percentage of both regulatory T cells (Tregs) and T helper 17
(TH17) cells were within the expected range of healthy donors, and
while Treg levels gradually decreased over the post-transplant
period, the absolute number of TH17 cells remained stable (Online
Supplementary Figure S4). The percentages and absolute number of B
cells were particularly low at the one-month and three-month
assessments (Online Supplementary Figure S5), and a subset analysis


revealed other imbalances. Specifically, a functionally immature/
transitional CD21 subset found to be elevated in association with
autoimmunity,2624 infection,27 and a subset of patients with
cGvHD2827 was increased throughout the assessment period.
However, this subset as well as most other abnormalities (including
the percentage of antigen inexperienced naïve B cells) recovered
through the first year. There were no significant differences seen
when comparing patients experiencing aGvHD or cGvHD compared
to those who did not experience GvHD for any assessment (data not
shown).

Samples were obtained at one month (n=33), three months
(n=29), six months (n=22), and 12 months (n=13). Lymphocytes
were gated on total CD45+ white blood cells, and all other subsets
were gated on lymphocytes. NK: natural killer.
Comparison to a matched control population
From the CIBMTR database, four controls were identified for 30
patients, three controls for three patients, and two and one control
for one patient each. The baseline characteristics for the patients in
the phase 2 trial and the control cohort are detailed in Table 2.
Median follow up was 15 months (range: 9-20 months) for patients
receiving Toc/Tac/MTX and 13 months (range; 3-72 months) for
the control cohort. The incidence of grades II-IV aGvHD at day 180
was significantly lower in the Toc/Tac/MTX cohort when compared
to the Tac/MTX control population (17% versus 45% at day 180,
HR=0.34 [0.17-0.69], P=0.003) (Figure 6A). Furthermore,
corresponding probabilities of grade II-IV aGvHD-free survival were
significantly higher in patients who received Toc/Tac/MTX than the


matched cohort (69% versus 42% at day 180, HR=0.37,
[0.21-0.67], P=0.001) (Figure 6B). There was no difference in the
incidence of cGvHD between recipients in the Toc/Tac/MTX versus
the Tac/MTX groups (38% versus 45% at 12 months, HR=0.65,
[0.37-1.13], P=0.13) (Figure 6C). There was also no difference in
TRM, relapse, or DFS at 12 months between the two groups (Figures
6D–6F).

Discussion
Inflammatory cytokine production is a proximate event in the
pathophysiology of aGvHD.31 While a number of inflammatory
molecules are produced as a consequence of the conditioning
regimen and the activation and expansion of alloreactive donor T
cells, IL-6 has emerged as an important cytokine mediator of tissue
damage.874 In the study herein, we demonstrate that inhibition of
IL-6 signaling by the administration of Toc in addition to standard
immune suppression resulted in a significant reduction in grades II-
IV aGvHD and an increase in grades II-IV aGvHD-free survival,
when compared to a matched control population. The
administration of Toc was also observed to be safe when given in


the setting of MA or reduced intensity Bu-based conditioning
regimens. Moreover, adverse events were largely confined to
transient elevations in transaminase values, and infectious
complications were not dissimilar to what we have previously
observed in this patient population treated with standard immune
suppression only.
The results of the current study extend those reported by Kennedy
and colleagues,18 who also examined the efficacy of Toc for the
prevention of aGvHD. These investigators observed an incidence of
grades II-IV and III-IV aGvHD at day 100 of 12% and 3%,
respectively, which was similar to what we observed (14% and 3%
for these same endpoints). There were, however, several important
differences between the two studies, which suggest that the results
may be more broadly generalizable to allogeneic HSCT recipients.
First of all, the median age of patients in our report was
substantially higher (66 versus 48), indicating that Toc
administration appears to have activity in older patients who
comprise an increasing percentage of the transplant population.20
Secondly, patients in the current report received Bu-based
conditioning regimens, whereas those in the study by Kennedy et al.
were treated with either total body irradiation and Cy (MA
conditioning) or Flu and melphalan (RIC). Since the intensity of the
conditioning regimen affects the degree of inflammatory cytokine
production2919 and incidence of aGvHD,30 the fact that promising
results were observed in patients who received different MA and
reduced intensity regimens is evidence that inhibition of IL-6 may
have activity across a spectrum of preparative regimens. Finally, we
were able to provide additional context to our data by
demonstrating a reduced incidence of grades II-IV aGvHD as well as
an increase in grades II-IV GvHD-free survival when compared to a
matched control population that only received Tac/MTX.
Despite the reduction in grades II-IV aGvHD, however, there was no
difference in TRM or OS between these two groups. There are
several possible explanations for this observation. First, this was not
a randomized trial, and the matching process could have resulted in
unperceived differences between the two cohorts that could have
impacted transplant outcome. Secondly, we observed two late
GvHD deaths beyond six months, suggesting that the salutary


effects conferred by Toc may be temporally limited. That there was
no difference in the incidence of cGvHD is compatible with this
interpretation. This does not, in our view, diminish the results, but
rather highlights that effective prophylactic strategies for GvHD are
likely to require a multi-tiered approach of which the mitigation of
aGvHD within the first six months would be one important step.
A notable finding in this study was the very low incidence of
aGvHD that occurred in the lower GI tract. Specifically, there were
no cases within the first 100 days, and only one case which
occurred by day 180. Pre-clinical studies have shown that IL-6
messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) levels are significantly
increased in the colons of mice,7 and the blockade of the IL-6
signaling pathway is able to significantly reduce the severity of
GvHD in this tissue site.87 IL-6 has also been identified as a plasma
biomarker that predicts for severity and non-relapse mortality in
patients with GI GvHD.31 Our findings further support the premise
that IL-6 plays an important role in mediating tissue damage in the
lower GI tract. Given that the incidence of liver GvHD has been
declining over time,32 involvement of the GI tract has emerged as
the primary driver of morbidity and mortality in patients with this
disease. In fact, the development of lower GI tract GvHD carries
significant prognostic implications for OS. Patients with lower tract
GvHD are more likely to be steroid-resistant,33 which itself is
associated with increased mortality.34 Furthermore, patients with
higher clinical and histological grades of lower GI tract GvHD have
an increase in non-relapse mortality that results in reduced OS.3635
Thus, given the poor prognosis associated with severe GI
GvHD,3837 therapeutic strategies that are focused on preventing
the development of this complication have the potential to impact
the overall course of this disease and improve transplant outcome.
While we observed patients with upper GI tract GvHD, recent
studies have shown that disease in this tissue site is generally
responsive to modest doses of steroids, and does not impact
OS.4039
We observed that IL-6 was the only measured serum cytokine that
was significantly increased above baseline in a control population of
patients that received Tac and MTX but not Toc. The administration
of Toc resulted in much higher serum IL-6 levels, above that seen in


the control population, in recipients of both MA and RIC regimens.
This was likely due to decreased consumption of IL-6 when Toc
binds to the IL-6R. IL-6 signaling occurs through two distinct
mechanisms; IL-6 can bind to a membrane receptor that is
expressed on hematopoietic cells and hepatocytes,41 and also bind
to a soluble form of the IL-6 receptor, which can in turn bind to
glycoprotein (gp)130, which is ubiquitously expressed on most
cells.4342 As further support for this premise, we observed that
sIL-6R levels were also significantly augmented in patients who
received both MA and RIC regimens. Of note, the immunoassay
used to detect sIL-6R levels captures free sIL-6R, IL-6R bound to
IL-6, and IL-6R bound to Toc.44 Therefore, we cannot distinguish
the composition of the sIL-6R complex, but it is likely that a
significant component is attributable to the binding of Toc to IL-6R,
given that a prior study showed that Toc can be detected for up to
one month in allogeneic stem cell transplant recipients.18 This
would therefore also explain the high IL-6 levels in these patients,
as free IL-6 may have been precluded from binding to the Toc/
sIL-6R complex. The fact that IL-6 levels were higher in patients
treated with MA versus RIC, however, suggests that the conditioning
regimen itself also contributed to the increase in IL-6 levels.
Notably, we did not observe meaningful increases in any of the
other cytokines that we examined (i.e., IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, TNF-α,
IFN-γ and IL-17) in control or Toc-treated patients, providing
evidence that dysregulation of IL-6 is an important early event post-
transplantation. Toc had no discernible adverse effect on immune
reconstitution, as patients achieved near normal T-cell and B-cell
subset numbers by 6-12 months post-transplantation.
In summary, this study demonstrates that Toc can be safely
administered in conjunction with standard immune suppression to
an older aged patient cohort treated with a Bu-based conditioning
for the prevention of GvHD. The administration of Toc resulted in a
low incidence of aGvHD, which was particularly evident within the
lower GI tract, and was significantly less than that observed in a
matched control population. There was, however, no difference in
the incidence of cGvHD or a reduction in TRM. We conclude that
Toc has activity for the prevention of aGvHD, and warrants further
examination in a randomized setting.
