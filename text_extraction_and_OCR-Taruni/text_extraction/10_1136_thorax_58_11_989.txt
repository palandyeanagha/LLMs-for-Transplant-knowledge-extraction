Abstract
Background: We investigated the use of high magnification
bronchovideoscopy combined with narrow band imaging (NBI) for
the detailed examination of angiogenic squamous dysplasia (ASD).
This was carried out in relation to bronchial vascular patterns with
abnormal mucosal fluorescence in heavy smokers at high risk for
lung cancer.
Methods: Forty eight patients with sputum cytology specimens
suspicious or positive for malignancy were entered into the study.
Conventional white light and fluorescence bronchoscopic
examination was first performed. Observations by high
magnification bronchovideoscopy with conventional white light
were made primarily at sites of abnormal fluorescence, and then
repeated with NBI light to examine microvascular networks in the
bronchial mucosa. Spectral features on the RGB (Red/Green/Blue)
sequential videoscope system were changed from the conventional
RGB broadband filter to the new NBI filter. The wavelength ranges
of the new NBI filter were B1: 400–430 nm, B2: 420–470 nm, and
G: 560–590 nm. ASD tissues were also examined using a confocal
laser scanning microscope equipped with argon-krypton (488 nm)
and argon (514 nm) laser sources.


Results: The microvessels, vascular networks of various grades, and
dotted vessels in ASD tissues were clearly observed in NBI-B1
images. Diameters of the dotted vessels visible on NBI-B1 images
agreed with the diameters of ASD capillary blood vessels diagnosed
by pathological examination. Capillary blood vessels were also
clearly visualised by green fluorescence by confocal laser scanning
microscopy. There was a significant association between the
frequency of dotted vessels by NBI-B1 imaging and tissues
confirmed as ASD pathologically (p=0.002).
Conclusions: High magnification bronchovideoscopy combined
with NBI was useful in the detection of capillary blood vessels in
ASD lesions at sites of abnormal fluorescence. This may enable the
discrimination between ASD and another pre-invasive bronchial
lesion.
