onischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a heart 
muscle disease in which one or both ventricles become 
enlarged, and the pumping function is decreased.1
Despite progress in pharmacotherapy for heart failure (HF), 
the prognosis of individuals with DCM is still poor, so it is 
important that DCM patients who are refractory to standard 
medical treatment be placed under strict management as early 
as possible. Several studies have attempted to identify abnor￾malities associated with poor prognosis in individuals with 
DCM.2–7 More efficient, less expensive, and simpler methods 
are required for diagnosis and risk assessment in these patients. 
Plasma brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) is 1 of the most power￾ful predictors of cardiac events in patients with DCM,6,8 but 
few other biomarkers that are suitable as prognostic markers 
for HF have been identified.
Indoxyl sulfate (IS) is a uremic toxin that accelerates the 
progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD).9 Tryptophan 
derived from dietary protein is metabolized to indole by tryp￾tophanase, which is produced by intestinal bacteria such as 
Escherichia coli. Indole is absorbed into the blood from the 
intestine and metabolized to IS in the liver, normally being 
excreted into urine; however, in uremia, reduced renal clear￾ance of IS leads to elevated serum levels, such as is observed 
in patients with CKD.10,11 Barreto et al suggested that IS might 
play a significant role in the vascular disease and high mortal￾ity observed in CKD patients.12 However, the association of 
IS and cardiac dysfunction remains uncertain, as does its use 
as a prognostic marker for HF patients.
The prevalence of renal dysfunction in individuals with 
chronic HF is approximately 25%13 and CKD contributes to 
reduced cardiac function, cardiac hypertrophy, and an increased 
risk of adverse cardiovascular events. We hypothesized that 
high serum IS levels would be associated with cardiac dysfunc￾tion and poor prognosis. To the best of our knowledge, there 
are no reports on the relationship between serum IS levels and 
prognosis in patients with DCM, so the aim of the present 
study was to determine whether the serum IS level is associ￾ated with hemodynamic parameters, and whether it is a predic￾N

Background: Serum indoxyl sulfate (IS) is a uremic toxin that accelerates the progression of chronic kidney disease
(CKD). The aim of this study was to determine whether serum IS is associated with hemodynamic parameters or
cardiac events in patients with nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM).
Methods and Results: The 76 patients with DCM had their serum IS and plasma brain natriuretic peptide (BNP)
levels measured, and underwent echocardiographic examination. Mean (± standard deviation) left ventricular ejection
fraction (LVEF) and BNP levels in the patients were 32.5±10.7% and 204±219pg/ml, respectively. Patients were
divided into 2 groups, low IS (<0.9μg/ml) and high IS (≥0.9μg/ml), based on the median value of serum IS. Although
there were no significant differences in LVEF and BNP between the groups, E/e’ was significantly greater in the high
IS group than in the low IS group. Furthermore, E/e’ was an independent determinant of serum IS level. The risk of
a cardiac event was significantly higher in the high IS group than in the low IS group (P=0.014). Moreover, serum IS
was a significant predictor of cardiac events even after adjustment for BNP.
Conclusions: Cardiac dysfunction is associated with the serum IS level, which might serve as a new prognostic
marker in DCM patients with normal renal function or mild to moderate CKD.   (Circ J 2013; 77: 390–396)

on patients with DCM because, if patients with cardiac dys￾function caused by ischemic cardiomyopathy were included, 
the ischemic heart disease could affect prognosis and conceal 
the effect of IS.
Methods
Study Population
We enrolled 76 patients with DCM (54 men, 22 women) in the 
study. DCM was defined by the presence of left ventricular 
ejection fraction (LVEF) <50% (as determined by echocar￾diography), and the absence of coronary artery stenosis (as 
determined by coronary angiography or computed tomography 
coronary angiography), valvular heart disease, arterial hyper￾Table 1. Baseline Clinical and Hemodynamic Characteristics, and Cardiac Events During Follow-up

tension, and secondary cardiac muscle disease attributable to 
any known systemic conditions.14 All the patients underwent 
laboratory measurements and echocardiography. The patients 
were followed up prospectively for cardiac death (death from 
worsening of HF or sudden death) for a mean of 32 months 
(range, 1.5–61 months). Cardiac events were defined as car￾diac death or hospitalization for worsening of HF. The Ethical 
Review Board of Nagoya University School of Medicine ap￾proved the study protocol and all subjects provided written in￾formed consent with regard to the study procedures and poten￾tial risks.
The estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) at baseline 
was calculated using the revised equation for Japanese indi￾viduals,15 which incorporates age, sex, and serum creatinine 
concentration: eGFR (ml·min–1 · 1.73m−2) for males was 
calculated as 194× (serum creatinine concentration)−1.094× 
(age)−0.287, whereas that for females was calculated with the 
same equation, with the result multiplied by a correction factor 
of 0.739. Patients with eGFR <30ml·min–1 ·1.73m−2 were 
excluded from the study.
Serum IS levels were measured by using high-performance 
liquid chromatography (HPLC).11 Each serum sample was 
filtered through a 0.20-μm membrane, and 10-μl samples of 
the filtrates were analyzed by reversed-phase HPLC (Shiseido 
Capcell Pak MF Ph-1 SG80 MF 150×4.6mm; Shiseido, Tokyo, 
Japan). The mobile phase, 0.1mol/L KH2PO4/tetrahydrofuran 
(95/5), was delivered at a flow rate of 1.0ml/min at 35°C. The 
serum IS levels were determined by fluorescence detection 
(excitation, 295nm; emission, 390nm).
Echocardiography
Standard M-mode and 2-dimensional echocardiography, Dop￾pler blood flow, and tissue Doppler imaging measurements 
were performed in agreement with the American Society of 
Echocardiography guidelines, using the Vivid 7 system (GE 
Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI, USA).16 Septal and posterior LV 
wall thicknesses were obtained from the parasternal long-axis 
view. The LV end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes were 
obtained from 4 apical and 2 chamber views.17 The LVEF was 
calculated from 2-dimensional apical images according to the 
modified Simpson’s method. Pulse-wave Doppler echocardiog￾raphy was used to assess mitral peak early (E) and late wave 
flow velocity and E-wave deceleration time. The tissue Dop￾pler imaging wave sample of the mitral annulus was obtained 
from the septal side of the apical 4-chamber view. The early 
(e’) diastolic peak velocity was calculated. The ratio of early 
transmitral flow velocity to early diastolic mitral annular ve￾locity (E/e’) was taken as an estimate of LV filling pressure.18

Statistical Analysis
Data are presented as mean±SD. Continuous variables were 
compared between the low and high IS groups with the use of 
Student’s t-test for unpaired data. Categorical variables are 
presented as numbers (percentages), and comparisons between 
the 2 groups were performed by the chi-squared test (or Fisher’s 
test where appropriate). Pearson’s correlation coefficient was 
used to assess relationships between serum IS levels and se￾lected clinical or biochemical variables. We used univariate 
and multivariate linear regression analyses to identify factors 
that were independently associated with serum IS; the multi￾variate model included all baseline valuables that had a sig￾nificant correlation with IS in the univariate analysis. Cumula￾tive cardiac event-free survival estimates were calculated by 
using the Kaplan-Meier method. Differences between survival 
curves were assessed by the log-rank test. Cox proportional 
hazard regression analysis was performed to calculate the 
hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval for cardiac 
events. In Cox proportional hazards analysis, HRs were calcu￾lated after just adjusting for plasma levels of BNP. Multivariate 
Cox proportional hazard regression analyses were performed 
to adjust for various factors, such as age, sex, eGFR, hemoglo￾bin, plasma BNP level, QRS duration and E/e’. All analyses 
were performed with the SPSS 19.0 software package (SPSS/
IBM, Chicago, IL, USA). P<0.05 was considered statistically 
significant.

≥0.9μg/ml). The mean serum IS level in the study population 
was 1.04±0.70 (range, 0.08–4.0μg/ml). Baseline clinical char￾acteristics of all the patients are listed in Table 1. There were 
no significant differences between the 2 groups in age, sex, or 
body mass index. With the exception of diuretics, there were 
no significant differences in drug treatment at entry into the 
study. The high IS group showed significantly higher serum 
creatinine levels and lower eGFR values than the low IS group. 
There were no significant differences between the 2 groups in 
plasma BNP levels. QRS duration was significantly longer in 
the high IS group than in the low IS group (118.5±27.4ms vs. 
107.5±15.2ms, P=0.039). E/e’ was significantly higher in the 
high IS group than in the low IS group (16.4±7.3 vs. 12.3±4.7, 
P=0.008). With the exception of E/e’, there were no significant 
differences in the echocardiography data of the 2 groups.
Correlation Between IS and Clinical Parameters
The results of univariate and multivariate linear regression 
analyses of the relationship between various clinical variables 
and IS are listed in Table 2. In the univariate analysis, a sig￾nificant positive correlation was observed for age, serum cre￾atinine, QRS duration, and E/e’, and a significant negative 
correlation was observed for eGFR. Neither LVEF nor plasma 
BNP correlated with serum IS. These 5 variables were then 
included in the multivariate analysis of IS, and only E/e’ and 
eGFR were found to be significant independent determinants 
of IS.
Figure 1 shows serum IS levels in patients with different 
stages of kidney function classified by eGFR (equivalent to 
stage 1 CKD: eGFR ≥90ml·min–1 ·1.73m−2, equivalent to stage 
2 CKD: 60–89ml·min–1 ·1.73m−2, and stage 3 CKD: 30–59ml·
min–1 ·1.73m−2). There were no patients with CKD stage 4 or 
5 in this study. Serum IS significantly increased as CKD pro￾gressed.
The 2 clinical outcomes (hospitalization for worsening of 
HF and cardiac death) were assessed by the Kaplan-Meier meth￾od and log-rank test (Figure 2). The probability of hospitaliza￾tion for HF was higher in the high IS group than in the low IS 
group (P=0.007) (Figure 2A). In contrast, there was no sig￾nificant difference between the 2 groups for the probability 
of cardiac death (Figure 2B). The probability of a cardiac 
event (hospitalization for HF, cardiac death, or both) was 
higher in the high IS group than in the low IS group (P=0.014; 
Figure 2C).
Cox proportional hazard regression analyses of survival free 
from cardiac events after only adjusting for BNP are shown in 
Table 3. Plasma BNP (HR 1.003, P=0.001), IS (HR 1.746, 
P=0.043), and QRS duration (HR 1.020, P=0.023) were iden￾tified as independent contributing factors for cardiac events. 
We performed univariate and multivariate Cox analyses with 
IS as a categorical variable (Table 4). After adjustment for age, 
sex, hemoglobin, eGFR, BNP, QRS duration, and E/e’ (model 
3), IS remained an independent predictor for cardiac events 
(HR 17.74; P=0.008).
Discussion
In the present study, we demonstrated that an elevated serum 
IS level was associated with both E/e’ and hospitalization for 
worsening of HF in DCM patients with normal renal function 
or mild to moderate CKD. These effects were independent of 
age, sex, hemoglobin, eGFR, BNP, QRS duration, and E/e’.
Serum IS as a Prognostic Marker
The serum IS level is associated with oxidative stress in CKD 
and vascular diseases,19,20 and is associated with cardiovascu￾lar mortality in CKD patients.12 Therefore, we investigated 
whether serum IS could be a useful prognostic marker in DCM 
patients. By conducting multivariate Cox proportional hazard 
regression analyses with several important clinical parameters, 
including plasma BNP levels, as explanatory variables, we dem￾onstrated that serum IS was an independent predictor of car￾diac events. This finding suggests that serum IS could be used 
in addition to BNP as a useful predictor of prognosis in ambu￾latory patients with DCM and normal kidneys or mild to mod￾erate kidney disease.
The average serum IS level in our study was lower than that 
in the previous studies.12,21 We previously reported serum IS 
levels of 0.64±0.86μg/ml in normal adults.9 In a previous 
study,21 the mean serum IS values in patients with CKD stage 
1, 2, 3 or 4 were 0.8±0.6μg/ml, 1.0±0.6μg/ml, 1.3±0.7μg/ml 
and 4.0±3.5μg/ml, respectively. Barreto et al reported that serum 
IS levels were 8.8±9.8μg/ml in patients with CKD stage 2 to 
5D.12 In the present study, serum IS levels in the patients with 
kidney function equivalent to CKD stage 1, 2 and 3 were 
0.55±0.53μg/ml, 0.92±0.53μg/ml and 1.41±0.78μg/ml, respec￾tively. The cut-off value 0.9μg/ml in the present study was 
almost the mean value of the patients with kidney function

equivalent to CKD stage 2. We considered that the main rea￾son for the difference between studies was our exclusion of 
patients with eGFR <30ml·min–1 ·1.73m−2. Because eGFR 
is inversely associated with IS level,12 patients with eGFR 
<30ml·min–1 ·1.73m−2 would have been expected to have high 
IS levels. In addition, patients in the present study showed an 
average LVEF of 32.5%, which indicates relatively mild LV 
systolic dysfunction in these DCM patients. Furthermore, al￾most all our subjects were in New York Heart Association 
functional class I or II, indicating no or mild HF symptoms.
The reason for the lack of a significant difference in cardiac 
death between the low and high IS groups might be the low 
incidence of cardiac death in the 2 groups. However, the prob￾ability of hospitalization for worsening HF was significantly 
higher in DCM patients with a high IS than in those with a low 
IS level. Furthermore, serum IS was a significant prognostic 
marker even after adjusting for BNP. However, neither serum 
creatinine nor eGFR was a significant marker (Table 3). There￾fore, serum IS, in addition to plasma BNP, could be consid￾ered to be a more informative prognostic marker than serum 
creatinine and eGFR. Our findings indicate that an elevated 
serum IS level is associated with a poor prognosis, even in 
ambulatory and stable DCM patients with normal kidney func￾tion or mild to moderate CKD. In other words, the serum IS 
level, in addition to that of plasma BNP, could be clinically 
useful for assessing the severity of HF and the efficacy of its 
treatment. Further study is necessary to determine the thera￾peutic utility of IS in stable HF patients.
Association Between Serum IS and Cardiac Function
E/e’ has been widely adopted as a noninvasive measure of 
intracardiac filling pressure.22,23 Here, E/e’ was significantly 
higher (ie, worse) in the high IS group than in the low IS group. 
Furthermore, E/e’ was an independent determinant of IS. Al￾though many studies have investigated uremic toxins, the ef￾fects of IS on the heart have rarely been evaluated. Therefore, 
the precise mechanism behind these effects remains unknown. 
Our results suggest that elevated serum IS might reflect dia￾stolic dysfunction in patients with DCM. Further hemody￾namic studies are warranted to clarify the mechanism.
QRS duration is an indication for biventricular pacing.24,25
In our study, QRS duration was longer in the high IS group 
than the low IS group, and there were 3 patients with biven￾tricular pacing in the high IS group, and none in the low IS 
group (Table 1). Although QRS duration significantly corre￾lated with IS, it was not significantly independently associated 
with IS in the multivariate analysis. Our finding that a wide 
QRS was an important sign of poor prognosis concurs with 
several reports of an association between QRS duration and 
prognosis.25,26 The results of our study suggest that IS might 
be associated with cardiac conduction disturbance, which would 
suggest an association between IS and progression of HF that 
may then require implantable cardioverter defibrillator or car￾diac resynchronization therapy, or lead to cardiac events.
Toxic Effects of IS
Recent research has revealed how IS exerts its toxic biologic 
effects. It inhibits endothelial proliferation and wound repair,27
and in rats it stimulates the proliferation of vascular smooth 
muscle cells.19 We have previously demonstrated that IS pro￾motes aortic calcification and aortic wall thickening in hyper￾tensive rats.28 Furthermore, IS has pro-fibrotic, pro-hypertro￾phic, and pro-inflammatory effects, indicating that it might 
play an important role in adverse cardiac remodeling mediated 
via activation of the p38 MAPK, p42/44 MAPK, and NF-κB 
pathways.20,29,30 With respect to the cardiac effect of IS, 
Lekawanvijit et al showed that IS at concentrations ranging 
from 3 to 200μmol/L significantly stimulated neonatal cardiac 
fibroblasts collagen synthesis in vitro.30 In the present study, 
the mean serum IS level was 1.04 (μg/ml), which is equivalent 
to 4.88μmol/L. Taking all the findings together, IS at the mean 
level observed in the present study may directly induce detri￾mental effects on cardiac cellular function. Further investiga￾tion to elucidate the mechanism is warranted.
Prevention of the Progression of HF
An oral sorbent (AST-120) reduces the serum and urine levels 
of IS in uremic rats and patients with CKD stage 4/5 by ad￾sorbing indole in the intestines, and consequently stimulating 
its excretion into feces. AST-120 delays the progression of 
CKD not only in uremic rats, but also in CKD patients.31–39
AST-120 is widely used as an approved drug, not only in 
Japan, but also in Korea, for the treatment of predialysis pa￾tients with CKD stage 4/5 to delay the progression of CKD. A 
multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled dose￾ranging study has demonstrated that AST-120 decreases serum 
IS levels in a dose-dependent fashion in patients with CKD 
stage 4/5.40 Recently, AST-120 has been reported to prevent 
the development of LV concentric change in predialysis CKD 
patients.41 Thus, AST-120 may also be effective in preventing 
cardiac dysfunction by reducing the serum levels of IS.
Study Limitations
First, the small sample size and low occurrence of cardiac 
events limited the power to prove a relationship between serum 
IS and prognosis. Further studies with a larger number of pa￾tients, including those with more severe HF symptoms, are 
needed to confirm our results. Second, patients with advanced 
CKD (stages 4 and 5) and/or ischemic heart disease were ex￾cluded, so it is unclear how their inclusion would affect the 
results. Third, we did not investigate the mechanism of IS￾induced cardiac effects. Further investigation is warranted to 
elucidate the mechanism.
Conclusions
Our results suggest that high IS levels are associated with car￾diac dysfunction, especially diastolic dysfunction, and conse￾quently increase the risk of cardiac events in patients with DCM. 
Further clinical studies with a larger number of both subjects 
and cardiac events are required to confirm our findings.
