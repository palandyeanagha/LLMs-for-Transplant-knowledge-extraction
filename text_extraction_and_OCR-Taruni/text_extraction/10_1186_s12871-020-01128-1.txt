Abstract
Background: Perioperative fluid management – including the type, dose, and timing of administration –directly
affects patient outcome after major surgery. The objective of fluid administration is to optimize intravascular fluid
status to maintain adequate tissue perfusion. There is continuing controversy around the perioperative use of
crystalloid versus colloid fluids. Unfortunately, the importance of fluid volume, which significantly influences the
benefit-to-risk ratio of each chosen solution, has often been overlooked in this debate.
Main text: The volume of fluid administered during the perioperative period can influence the incidence and
severity of postoperative complications. Regrettably, there is still huge variability in fluid administration practices,
both intra-and inter-individual, among clinicians. Goal-directed fluid therapy (GDFT), aimed at optimizing flow￾related variables, has been demonstrated to have some clinical benefit and has been recommended by multiple
professional societies. However, this approach has failed to achieve widespread adoption. A closed-loop fluid
administration system designed to assist anesthesia providers in consistently applying GDFT strategies has recently
been developed and tested. Such an approach may change the crystalloid versus colloid debate. Because colloid
solutions have a more profound effect on intravascular volume and longer plasma persistence, their use in this
more “controlled” context could be associated with a lower fluid balance, and potentially improved patient
outcome. Additionally, most studies that have assessed the impact of a GDFT strategy on the outcome of high-risk
surgical patients have used hydroxyethyl starch (HES) solutions in their protocols. Some of these studies have
demonstrated beneficial effects, while none of them has reported severe complications.

Conclusions: The type and volume of fluid used for perioperative management need to be individualized
according to the patient’s hemodynamic status and clinical condition. The amount of fluid given should be guided
by well-defined physiologic targets. Compliance with a predefined hemodynamic protocol may be optimized by
using a computerized system. The type of fluid should also be individualized, as should any drug therapy, with
careful consideration of timing and dose. It is our perspective that HES solutions remain a valid option for fluid
therapy in the perioperative context because of their effects on blood volume and their reasonable benefit/risk
profile.

Background
Perioperative fluid therapy is a routine aspect of daily
clinical practice for most anesthesiologists but remains a
therapeutic challenge. One of the most complex aspects
of perioperative fluid therapy is determining how much
fluid to give each patient. Numerous observational studies
have reported a strong association between both excessive
and insufficient perioperative fluid administration and an
increased risk of postoperative complications [1–6]. As it is
difficult to predict or anticipate the volume of fluids a pa￾tient will need during surgery, several national and inter￾national societies recommend using goal-directed fluid
therapy (GDFT) based on advanced hemodynamic moni￾toring in patients undergoing high-risk surgery [7–10].
GDFT has been promoted as helping to standardize fluid
administration using recommended and validated proto￾cols, thereby improving patient outcomes and decreasing
costs [11–13]. Despite an abundance of literature on this
topic, the volume of fluid that should be administered to
achieve and maintain normovolemia is still the subject
intense controversy.
The choice of intravenous fluid type has also been a
subject of passionate debate, recently refueled by the
publication of several large, prospective, randomized
studies in different patient populations. These studies
have demonstrated the impact of intravenous fluid solu￾tions on patient outcomes, particularly in critically ill pa￾tients in the intensive care setting [14]. Although their
results have created intense controversy, these studies
have clearly demonstrated that the need for intravenous
infusions may vary considerably in a given patient during
the course of his/her clinical course [15]. They have also
indicated that results observed in critically ill patients can￾not be extrapolated to surgical patients. The R.O.S.E. con￾ceptual model (Resuscitation, Optimization, Stabilization,
Evacuation) condenses precisely a dynamic approach of
fluid therapy allowing to maximize its benefits while redu￾cing its harms [16]. Importantly, surgical patients receiv￾ing i.v fluids in the perioperative setting are typically in
the “Optimization phase” and this specific category of pa￾tients will be discussed in the present review. Therefore,
the goal of this narrative review article is to discuss the
fundamentals of perioperative fluid therapy through four
frequently asked questions regarding perioperative fluid
therapy.
Main text
Question 1: should we administer fluids in a goal-directed
fashion?
YES.
There is quite strong evidence to support the benefits
of GDFT in high-risk patients undergoing major surgical
procedures [9, 11]. Indeed, over the past 15 years, several
meta-analyses of the impact of GDFT in patients under￾going moderate and high-risk surgeries have observed
that GDFT improves outcome compared with routine
care [8, 11, 17–20]. However, the studies included in
these meta-analyses are highly heterogeneous, with dif￾ferent protocols, different physiologic endpoints, and
different technologies to measure stroke volume and
cardiac output. Interestingly, these studies demonstrate
that patients in the GDFT groups also received highly
variable volumes of fluids. While clinical pathways and
protocols are not designed to eliminate all forms of vari￾ability, differences in individual care should be patient
driven and not practitioner dependent. Adequate GDFT
for patients undergoing major surgery requires that
stroke volume or cardiac output are monitored to assess
fluid responsiveness and that an algorithm is designed
that will be applied by all members of the anesthesia
team. Admittedly, some studies have not demonstrated a
beneficial effect of GDFT on patient outcome [21–25].
However, these studies were mainly underpowered and/
or conducted in relatively healthy patients with minimal
fluid shift and blood loss [23, 24, 26–28]. Additionally,
compliance to the study protocols must be examined
closely when evaluating the results [29]. Pearse et al.
nicely demonstrated that when a GDFT protocol is con￾sistently applied, the treatment effect is strengthened
[25]. Indeed, according to the authors of this study, “In
the prespecified adherence-adjusted analysis conducted
using established methods, the observed treatment effect
was strengthened when the 65 patients whose care was
non adherent were assumed to experience the same
Joosten et al. BMC Anesthesiology (2020) 20:209 Page 2 of 9

outcome as if they had been allocated to the alternative
group (RR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.61–0.99; P = 0.04)”. Another
point of interest is that use of a GDFT protocol has
never been associated with a deleterious effect for the
patient. It is therefore not surprising that GDFT has
been included in the national expert recommendations
of several countries, including the United Kingdom and
France [7, 10]. Obviously, some questions related to
GDFT remain unanswered. What is the ideal endpoint?
What is the best monitor to use when applying GDFT?
What should be the ideal maintenance crystalloid infu￾sion rate? What is the ideal “type” of fluid (crystalloid
alone or a combination of crystalloid and colloid)? What
is the ideal target patient population? Should GDFT pro￾tocols include inotropic support?
Most institutions and anesthesiology departments have
written protocols and standardized pathways for man￾agement of severe perioperative bleeding, although “level
1A” evidence is mostly absent [30, 31]. Application of
these protocols has demonstrated reduced variability in
treatment and improved quality of care [32]. In our
opinion, the same approach should be applied to
hemodynamic and fluid management. In accordance
with international guidelines, institutions should be en￾couraged to establish a written GDFT protocol. These
GDFT strategies can rely on pulse pressure variation
alone, enabling use in the absence of a cardiac output
monitor and in clinical settings where more advanced
monitoring is not available. As a result, implementing
GDFT should not be associated with a large increase in
costs.
Question 2: is it possible to improve current GDFT?
YES.
Despite the development of minimally invasive moni￾toring devices and the simplification of GDFT protocols
over the last decade [33, 34], clinicians’ compliance with
the application of these protocols remains poor, ranging
between 62 and 87%, even in ideal study conditions
[9, 35]. Adherence of less than 50% to protocols is re￾ported in daily practice across different medical spe￾cialties, but at least 80% adherence is required to
observe improved clinical outcomes [36–38]. Effective
management and application of GDFT algorithms
often requires careful monitoring with frequent and
repeated interventions by the clinician [34]. This can
be particularly difficult for anesthesiologists who work
in a stressful environment and are subject to numer￾ous stimuli and distractions, all of which can decrease
their attention and concentration.
In a recent prospective feasibility study, Menger et al.
paired a second anesthesiologist, who was specifically
dedicated to applying the written GDFT protocol, with
the primary anesthesiologist in charge of the patient.
With this “active clinical decision support system”, the
authors observed a protocol compliance of about 85%
[39]. Unfortunately, such an approach is very costly in
terms of human resources, which limits its implementa￾tion [40]. Over the past decade, members of our team
have developed a closed-loop administration system
based on the simultaneous analysis of multiple advanced
hemodynamic indices provided by a minimally-invasive
hemodynamic monitoring device and controlled by a
computer [27, 41–43] (Fig. 1). With this system, the ad￾ministration of multiple fluid boluses is completely auto￾mated, requiring only minimal human intervention. We
have demonstrated that implementation of this “com￾puter system” resulted in less intraoperative time spent
in a preload-dependent state (stroke volume variation >
13%) compared to a manually applied protocol, using
both minimally invasive and noninvasive technologies
[43, 44]. Implementation of these systems at the patient’s
bedside has also been associated with better patient out￾comes compared to routine care [45]. The software for
this technology has now been implemented into the
EV1000 monitoring device as a real-time clinical deci￾sion support system and is widely available for clinical
use [46]. Of note, after the initial development of our
closed-loop system for GDFT administration, our atten￾tion has now shifted to automated system allowing tight
vasopressor infusion in order to be able to design a fully
automated system for perioperative goal directed
hemodynamic therapy, allowing the co-titration of fluid
and vasopressors [47–52].
Question 3: is there a place for a colloid solution in GDFT
protocols?
YES.
From a physiological perspective, it seems obvious that
colloid solutions have a role in GDFT protocols [53].
Colloid solutions remain longer intravascularly than do
crystalloid solutions, continuing to create oncotic pres￾sure, so theoretically they are associated with a decrease
in the amount of fluid needed to achieve and maintain
hemodynamic goals [54–57]. The exclusive use of crys￾talloid solutions, because of their lower volume effect
and shorter intravascular persistence, is associated with
greater volumes of fluid administration resulting in fluid
overload and its potential complications in the peri￾operative period [57]. Indeed, compared to colloid solu￾tions, greater crystalloid fluid volumes may be required
to restore intravascular volume [58]. In an experimental
study, Hiltebrand et al. showed that compared to a crys￾talloid solution (Ringer’s lactate), administration of HES
boluses, guided by the measurement of venous oxygen
saturation, reduced the total volume of fluid infused
and, more importantly, improved microcirculatory blood
flow and intestinal oxygen partial pressure after

abdominal surgery [59]. Excessive fluid administration
(mainly crystalloids) has been shown to increase the risk
of intestinal tissue edema, leading not only to delayed re￾sumption of intestinal activity and anastomotic leakage,
but also to a risk of pulmonary edema and postoperative
respiratory complications, all of which increase the hos￾pital length of stay [6, 60]. The use of large volumes of
isotonic saline (0.9% NaCl) also leads to an increased
risk of hyperchloremic acidosis, which can lead to
gastrointestinal and renal dysfunction, secondary to the
vasoconstrictive properties of the chloride ion [61]. Im￾portantly, volume effects of colloids have been demon￾strated to be context sensitive [62]. Administration of
iso-oncotic colloids (5% albumin or 6% hydroxyethyl
starch) during acute bleeding when carefully maintaining
intravascular normovolemia led to volume effects of
more than 90% [63, 64]. In contrast, preoperative vol￾ume loading in a non-bleeding patient resulted in a vol￾ume effect of only 30–35%, two-third of the given bolus
leaving the vascular space toward the interstitial com￾partment within minutes [65]. Colloids and crystalloids
cannot be exchanged by simply adapting the amount
[66]. Recently, Orbegozo Cortes et al. reviewed all stud￾ies comparing crystalloid and colloid solutions in all
types of patients (medical, surgical, and trauma patients),
many of which likely had altered vascular permeability
[54]. They reported that greater volumes were required
to achieve similar targets with crystalloid than with
colloid solutions (estimated ratio: 1.50; 95% CI: 1.36–
1.65). Figure 2 represents the comparison of the
crystalloids vs colloids ratio extracted from the study
from Orbegozo et al. in the context of an administra￾tion of crystalloids without or with a certain amount
of colloids [54]. These results were confirmed by
Annane et al. in the CRISTAL study [67]. Although
this ratio would be expected to be greater than 1.5, it
is important to note that none of these studies strictly
compared a pure colloid with a pure crystalloid strat￾egy as the colloid groups also always received some
crystalloid infusion.
In the context of perioperative GDFT, there are very
few clinical data evaluating the influence of the type of
intravenous fluid used on outcome. Not surprisingly,
there are currently no recommendations as to the type
of fluid (crystalloids or colloids) that should be used to
optimize a patient’s intravascular blood volume in the
perioperative setting. It is interesting to note that 85% of
the GDFT studies published in the literature used a col￾loid solution to optimize the patient’s stroke volume and
cardiac output [53]. Most of these studies demonstrated
a benefit in favor of the GDFT group versus the control
group, which should encourage our academic commu￾nity to continue examining the potential benefits of
colloid use moving forward.

Question 4: is there a place for hydroxyethyl starch
solutions?
YES.
Albumin is the most frequently used colloid solution
and is considered to be the colloid solution of choice.
The main limitations to its use are cost and availability,
which have led to the development of synthetic colloid
solutions as alternatives. Among synthetic colloid,
starches are by far the most studied solutions.
HES solutions are plant-based (corn or potato) colloid
solutions derived from the enzymatic hydrolysis of
starch. Their properties are defined by molecular weight,
degree of substitution, C2/C6 ratio and concentration.
They are available as either 0.9% saline or balanced crys￾talloid solutions. The most recent (third) generation of
HES solutions has a lower molecular weight, which
maintains oncotic effects while simultaneously decreas￾ing adverse events (i.e., hemostatic alterations, renal fail￾ure, and pruritus). The maximum daily recommended
dose is 30 ml/kg.
There is considerable controversy regarding the bene￾fits and risks associated with the use of HES solutions.
This controversy has stemmed from large multicenter
studies in critically ill patients, and more specifically sep￾tic patients, which have reported adverse effects of HES
solutions on mortality and/or renal function [68–70].
These studies have prompted the European Medicine
Agency to restrict its use in the perioperative context.
Several meta-analyses showed no association between
HES administration and worse outcome in surgical pa￾tients [71, 72], so these concerns likely do not apply to
short term intraoperative fluid expansion. Additionally,
most studies that have demonstrated a benefit of GDFT
over standard of care in high-risk surgical patients have
used HES solutions to optimize stroke volume or cardiac
output [53].
One small single-center, single-blinded randomized
trial compared 5% albumin solution to 6% HES 130/0.4
solution used as part of a GDFT protocol in patients
undergoing elective cystectomy [73]. There was no sig￾nificant difference between the two groups with respect
to the primary outcome, i.e., kidney function and kidney
injury assessed up to postoperative day 90. Of note, the
incidence of pruritus, evaluated by a questionnaire, was
significantly higher in the albumin group.
Four double-blinded randomized studies have assessed
the impact on patient outcome of HES 130/0.4 solution
versus a crystalloid solution while standardizing the vol￾ume and timing of administration using a GDFT proto￾col [56, 57, 74, 75]. Yates et al. reported no benefit of
HES solution over Ringer’s lactate (Hartmann) solution
in terms of postoperative complications in 202 patients
undergoing colorectal surgery [56]. However, in this
monocenter study, 38% of patients in the crystalloid
group received a rescue colloid solution (a gelatin) com￾pared to 12% in the HES group. Interpretation of the re￾sults is thus challenging as this study actually compared
two groups that received a combination of crystalloid
and colloid solutions in different proportions. We ob￾served that a HES-based GDFT was associated with a
lower incidence of postoperative complications than a
balanced crystalloid GDFT in 160 patients undergoing
major abdominal surgery [57]. In a multicenter study
(N = 1057), Kabon et al. reported that Doppler-guided
intraoperative HES administration did not reduce a
composite outcome of serious postoperative cardiac, pul￾monary, infectious, gastrointestinal, renal and coagula￾tion complications compared to lactated Ringer’s

colloids versus crystalloids, but to compare crystalloids without or with a certain amount of colloids

solution in patients undergoing moderate-to-high risk
abdominal surgery [74]. In another multicenter study of
775 patients at increased risk of postoperative kidney in￾jury after major abdominal surgery, Futier et al. reported
that HES solution used according to a stroke volume￾guided hemodynamic therapy algorithm did not reduce
a composite outcome of death or major postoperative
complications compared to isotonic saline [75]. How￾ever, more patients in the HES group developed mild
acute kidney injury (P = .03) in the immediate postopera￾tive period. In contrast, we did not observe any deleteri￾ous effect of HES solution on long-term (1 year) kidney
function compared to a balanced crystalloid solution in
our study population [76].
Not surprisingly, these four studies confirm what physi￾ology tells us: to achieve a predefined hemodynamic
target, a smaller volume of colloid solution, namely HES
130/0.4, is required, compared to crystalloid solution,
resulting in a less positive intraoperative fluid balance. Of
note, several studies have reported an association between
positive perioperative fluid balance and worse outcome
[77–80]. However, among the four studies cited above,
our study reported a reduced incidence of postoperative
complications with the use of HES solution, associated
with a lower intraoperative fluid balance [57]. Interest￾ingly, the major difference between our study and the
three others is the protocol used to guide fluid administra￾tion. While the three other studies [68, 69, 71] used a
pragmatic approach in which fluid boluses (250 ml fluid
challenges) were administered manually by the clinician in
charge of the patient in order to maximize stroke volume,
we used a closed-loop delivery system in which small bo￾luses (100 ml mini-fluid challenges) were administered
automatically by a computer-controlled infusion pump
with dedicated software that optimized stroke volume
[70]. This system allowed strict standardization of fluid
administration, increasing compliance with the protocol
and improving the accuracy of implementation. The prag￾matic approach used in the other studies, which reflects
routine clinical practice, is inherently associated with
lower protocol adherence and a high potential risk of
protocol violations. When comparing our study to the
study by Futier et al., the different strategies resulted in
more “liberal” fluid administration in the Futier et al. study
and a more “restrictive” approach in ours. However, the
amount of HES solution infused in the colloid groups of
the two studies was approximately the same (±1000 ml),
whereas the total volume of crystalloid solution was much
higher in the study by Futier et al. Consequently, cumula￾tive net fluid balance on day one was also much more
positive in this latter study (Fig. 3), which might explain
the difference in the results reported in these two studies.
In accordance with this hypothesis, fluid volume rather
than fluid type may be responsible for the divergent
results seen across the four studies. Importantly, the
study of Joosten et al. [57] included the smaller num￾ber of patients compared to the three other ones [56,
74, 75]; their results need to be therefore confirmed.
Two large randomized controlled trials (TETHYS trial
[N = 350] in trauma patients and PHOENICS trial
[N = 2280] in elective abdominal surgical patients) are
on the way. They should clearly help to precise the
benefit to risk ratio associated with the use of HES in
the two specific contexts. In the final debate, the
price should be taken into account as HES solutions
are much more expensive than crystalloid solutions,
but significantly cheaper than albumin solutions in
most European countries.

Conclusion
In the perioperative setting, not only the type of fluid
but also the volume administered can impact a patient’s
outcome following major surgery. Fluid volume should
be guided by predefined physiologic targets, using an in￾dividualized hemodynamic algorithm. Clinician compli￾ance with such protocols can be improved by using
automated closed-loop systems that enable automation
of some of the simple but restrictive therapeutic tasks. It
is of prime importance that intravenous fluids be admin￾istered with the same care as any other drug, with strict
indications and contraindications and precautions with
regard to potential adverse effects. Finally, perioperative
colloid solutions, and in particular HES solutions, may
have a place in optimizing a patient’s hemodynamic sta￾tus while limiting the total volume of fluid administered.
Large multicenter studies that assess the impact of crys￾talloids vs colloids and that apply a strict approach that
ensures high protocol compliance, for example with a
closed-loop system, are needed.
