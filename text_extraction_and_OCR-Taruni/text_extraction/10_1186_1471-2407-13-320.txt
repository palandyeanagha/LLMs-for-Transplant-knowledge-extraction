Abstract
Background: Tumor dissemination to cervical lymph nodes via lymphatics represents the first step in the
metastasis of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and is the most significant predictor of tumor
recurrence decreasing survival by 50%. The lymphatic suppressing properties of mTOR inhibitors are not yet well
understood.
Methods: Lymphatic inhibiting effects of rapamycin were evaluated in vitro using two lymphatic endothelial cell
(LEC) lines. An orthotopic mouse model of HNSCC (OSC-19 cells) was used to evaluate anti-lymphangiogenic effects
of rapamycin in vivo. The incidence of cervical lymph node metastases, numbers of tumor-free lymphatic vessels
and those invaded by tumor cells in mouse lingual tissue, and expression of pro-lymphangiogenic markers were
assessed.
Results: Rapamycin significantly decreased lymphatic vascular density (p = 0.027), reduced the fraction of lymphatic
vessels invaded by tumor cells in tongue tissue (p = 0.013) and decreased metastasis-positive lymph nodes (p = 0.04).
Rapamycin also significantly attenuated the extent of metastatic tumor cell spread within lymph nodes (p < 0.0001). We
found that rapamycin significantly reduced LEC proliferation and was correlated with decreased VEGFR-3 expression in
both LEC, and in some HNSCC cell lines.
Conclusions: The results of this study demonstrate anti-lymphangiogenic properties of mTOR inhibitors in HNSCC.
mTOR inhibitors suppress autocrine and paracrine growth stimulation of tumor and lymphatic endothelial cells by
impairing VEGF-C/VEGFR-3 axis and release of soluble VEGFR-2. In a murine HNSCC orthotopic model rapamycin
significantly suppressed lymphovascular invasion, decreased cervical lymph node metastasis and delayed the spread of
metastatic tumor cells within the lymph nodes.

Background
Despite advances in treatment options, there have been
no significant improvements in 5-year survival rates of
head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) pa￾tients in the past four decades. While the 1-year survival
rate is 81%, the 5-year survival rate remains at ~45% for
all stages of oral cancer [1]. Metastasis to regional lymph
nodes occurs in 30-40% of HNSCC cases [2], and is as￾sociated with poor prognosis and low survival [2,3].
Lymphatogenous spread of cancer cells is a significant
problem in HNSCC reflecting the rich lymphatic supply
in the head and neck. High risk features, such as
lymphovascular invasion and extracapsular spread sig￾nificantly increase the risk of both local recurrence, and
distant metastasis. Consequently postoperative adjuvant
chemoradiotherapy is recommended to decrease recur￾rence rates [4]. De Carvalho in a prospective analysis of

170 cases of previously untreated patients with laryngeal
or hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma found that
macroscopic extracapsular tumor spread increased the
risk of recurrence 3.5-fold compared with patients with
no evidence of metastasis at their initial diagnosis, or pa￾tients in whom the tumor was confined to the lymph
node [5]. In another study, patients with extracapsular
nodal spread had significantly higher rates of recurrent
disease and distant metastasis [6].
Tumor cell spread to regional lymph nodes through
lymphatic vessels is known to be one of the worst
prognostic factors, decreasing survival by 50%. Forma￾tion of new tumor-associated lymphatic vessels through
lymphangiogenesis plays an active role in the initiation
and progression of metastatic disease spread as demon￾strated by the significant correlation between intratumoral
lymphatic vascular density and lymph node metastasis.
HNSCC is characterized by persistent activation of the
Akt/mTOR pathway that triggers a cascade of molecular
events central to carcinogenesis including cancer cell
survival, cell cycle progression, proliferation, transcrip￾tion and translation, angiogenesis, invasion, and metas￾tasis [7,8]. The Akt/mTOR pathway is a fundamental
coordinator of several signaling pathways related to cell
growth and division, and mTOR inhibitors effectively re￾duce proliferation in cells with constitutively upregulated
Akt/mTOR signaling. The mammalian target of rapamycin
(mTOR) signaling pathway is dysregulated in nearly all
(99%) cases of HNSCC [9]. mTOR inhibitors depress
translation of several mRNAs specifically required for
tumor cell cycle progression, proliferation, and angiogen￾esis suppressing oncogenesis [10-15]. Because these path￾ways are commonly dysregulated in cancer, mTOR
represents an attractive anti-tumor target. The mTOR in￾hibitor rapamycin (sirolimus) was approved by the FDA in
1999 to prevent renal transplant rejection [16] and is a
clinically approved immunosuppressive agent with
promising anti-tumor properties. Chronic use of rapamycin
shows a good safety profile in renal transplantion [17,18]
and is well tolerated with only mild and usually reversible
side effects which include herpes simplex lesions,
acne-like and maculopapular rash, and nail disorders.
Dose-limiting toxicities consist of mucositis/stomatitis,
asthenia, thrombocytopenia and hyperlipidemia [19].
Although the role of mTOR inhibitors is well
established in renal cell carcinoma and recent phase 1
and 2 studies in solid tumors hold promise, their anti￾lymphatic properties are not well characterized. Previ￾ously in collaboration with Dr. Silvio Gutkind’s group
(Oral and Pharyngeal Cancer Branch, National Institute
of Dental Research, NIH) using an orthotopic model of
HNSCC generated by injection of UMSCC2 cells into
the tongue of SCID/NOD mice we demonstrated signifi￾cant inhibition of tumor growth, decreased lymphatic
microvessel density and a decrease in the number of in￾vaded lymph nodes after rapamycin and RAD001 treat￾ment [20]. In the current study we expand the analysis of
the anti-lymphatic properties of rapamycin by using an
orthotopic murine model of HNSCC generated by injection
of highly metastatic OSC-19 cells. Here we investigated the
molecular mechanisms of rapalogue anti-lymphatic action
and related anti-tumor effects.
Methods
Evaluation of the anti-lymphangiogenic effects of
rapamycin in a regional metastasis model
All animal studies were carried out according to the
protocol approved by the Louisiana State University
Health Sciences Center Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee, in compliance with the Committee
guidelines. Severe combined immunodeficient (SCID)
male mice, 4 to 6 weeks of age (Charles River Laborator￾ies, Wilmington, Massachusetts), were housed in a bar￾rier facility and maintained on a normal diet ad libitum.
2 × 105 OSC-19 cells, a highly invasive and metastasis￾prone oral squamous carcinoma cell line, were injected
into the basolateral region of the tongues of SCID mice.
The mice were randomized into two groups (28 control
mice and 25 rapamycin-treated mice ). 5 days after cell
injections mice were given daily IP injections of vehicle
(4% DMSO, 5.2% Tween 80, and 5.2% polyethylene gly￾col 400) or rapamycin at a dose of 5 mg/kg. 21 days after
injection of OSC-19 cells mice were sacrificed. Lingual
tissue and cervical lymph node samples were harvested.
Mouse tongues were bisected and consecutive samples
of lingual tissue and cervical lymph nodes were fixed in
10% neutral buffered formalin for 24 hours, processed
and embedded in paraffin. Lingual tissue sections were
stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and cross￾sectional area of xenograft tumors was measured using
Image-J software (NIH; Windows version). Cervical
lymph node samples were examined microscopically by
a pathologist using H&E and cytokeratin staining to deter￾mine the cervical lymph node metastasis incidence. The
number of tumor-free lymphatic vessels and those invaded
by tumor cells in mouse tongues was assessed by our
pathologist using LYVE-1 (a lymphatic-specific biomarker)
immunohistochemical staining (R&D Systems, Minneap￾olis, MN). Lymphatic vessels invaded by tumor cells were
defined as those with the presence of tumor cells in the
endothelium-lined space (i.e lymphovascular invasion).
Blood microvascular density was assessed after immunohis￾tochemical staining with CD31 (PECAM-1; Santa Cruz Bio￾technology, Santa Cruz, CA). Individual microvessels were
counted using a × 400 field (× 40 objective lens and × 10
ocular lens). At least three random fields within the
tumor area were viewed and counted at × 400 magnifi￾cation. Results were expressed as the average number of

microvessels per field. Unpaired t test with Welch correc￾tion was used to evaluate the differences between treat￾ment groups.
Cell Lines
HMEC-1A cells are a human lymphatic endothelial cell
line that was subcloned [21] from HMEC-1 cells – an
immortalized cell culture, which is a combination of
lymphatic and blood vascular endothelial cells [22].
HMEC-1A cells were maintained in MCDB 131 medium
(Sigma-Aldrich), supplemented with 20mM HEPES, 1
ug/ml hydrocortisone, 10 ng/ml EGF and 10% fetal bo￾vine serum (FBS).
SV-LEC cells, a stable mouse lymphatic endothelial
cell line, was isolated from mesenteric adventitial tissue
and shown to express specific lymphatic markers Prox-1,
LYVE-1 and VEGFR-3 [23]. SV-LEC cells were cultured
in DMEM/F12 medium supplemented with 10% FBS.
HNSCC cell line SCC40 (tongue cancer) was kindly pro￾vided by Dr. Susanne Gollin and PCI-15a (pyriform sinus
cancer) was provided by Dr. Theresa L. Whiteside (both
from the University of Pittsburgh Graduate School of
Public Health). FaDu cells, established from hypopharyngeal
SCC, were procured from ATCC. SCC40, PCI-15a and
FaDu cultures were maintained in MEM media
supplemented with 10% FBS and non-essential amino
acids. 2 × 105 OSC-19 cells, a gift from Dr. Eben L.
Rosenthal (University of Alabama at Birmingham),
were cultured in DMEM/F12 medium supplemented
with 10% FBS.
Cell Proliferation Assay
The effects of rapamycin (LC Laboratories, Woburn,
MA) on proliferation of SV-LEC or HMEC-1A cells
were determined by plating exponentially growing cells
in 96-well plates (2,000 per well) with 200 μl of
medium. The cells were incubated at 37°C for 3.5
hours for adherence and then treated with vehicle
(DMSO) or various concentrations of rapamycin
(1-1000 ng/ml) for time points ranging from 0 to 72 h.
Cell proliferation was measured using a modified MTT
(3-(4-5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-
(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium salt/phenazine methosulfate)
system according to the manufacturer's instructions
(CellTiter 96 AQueous cell proliferation assay; Promega
Corp., Madison, WI).
Detection of apoptosis in lymphatic endothelial cells by
DAPI staining
SV-LEC (10,000 cells) or HMEC-1A (20,000 cells) were
seeded on 12 mm circular glass cover slips in 24-well
plates and allowed to attach for 4 h. Cells were then
treated with 100 ng/ml of rapamycin or vehicle control
(DMSO) for 72 h, washed with phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS) and fixed in cold 2% paraformaldehyde for 15
min. Cells were then washed with PBS, fixed with cold
70% ethanol at -20°C for 1 h and stained with 1 mg/ml
DAPI for 30 min in the dark. The coverslips were washed
2× with PBS, and mounted using DAKO fluorescent
mounting fluid onto microscope slides. Cells were viewed
and counted using a fluorescent Olympus Bx50 micro￾scope using a 40× objective. The number of total and
apoptotic cells were counted at least in four fields of each
slide.
Western Blot Analysis
Soluble proteins were extracted as previously described
[24]. 30 ug of protein was loaded per well and the ex￾pression of tumor and lymphatic biomarkers evaluated
by western blotting using the following antibodies:
4EBP1 (1:300 dilution), phospho-4EBP1 (serine 37/46;
1:300 dilution), total and phospho-S6 ribosomal protein
(serine 235/236, 1:100), actin (1:3,000; – all above - Cell
Signaling, Beverly, MA). VEGFR-3/Flt-4 antibody was used
at a 1:100 dilution (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). The
expression levels of each marker were quantified after
normalizing to actin scan density by immunoblotting.
Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 ELISA assay
The effects of rapamycin treatment on serum levels of sol￾uble VEGFR-2 in mouse serum samples were determined
using a mouse VEGFR-2 ELISA kit (R&D Systems,
Minneapolis, MN) according to manufacturer's instructions.
Results
Anti-lymphatic effects of rapamycin in orthotopic HNSCC
model
Anti-lymphatic effects of rapamycin were evaluated in
the orthotopic OSCC tongue tumor model (Figure 1).
OSC-19 cells injected into tongues of SCID mice formed
tumors (Figure 1A) in all mice and yielded a reprodu￾cibly high rate of regional metastases by week 3.
Rapamycin significantly inhibited tumor growth as mea￾sured by tumor cross-sectional area at the end of experi￾ment. The mean total cross-sectional area was 27.4 ±
13.4 mm2 in control mice which was decreased to 8.4 ±
6.7 mm2 in rapacymin-treated mice (p < 0.0001).
Rapamycin significantly decreased intratumoral lymph￾atic vascular density from 9.1 ± 4.10 in control mice to
5.8 ± 1.18 in rapamycin-treated mice (p = 0.027) as well as
the fraction of lymphatic vessels (identified by LYVE-1
staining) invaded by tumor cells in primary OSC-19 tu￾mors obtained from mouse lingual tissue (Figure 1D). The
percentage of lymphatic vessels invaded by tumor cells de￾creased from 62.78 ± 15.13% in controls to 40.44 ± 20.67
in the rapamycin-treated mice (p = 0.013).
H&E and cytokeratin stained slides of the cervical
lymph nodes were analyzed by the study pathologist to

determine the presence of metastases and the extent of
spread within the lymph nodes. Following rapamycin
treatment we observed a significant decrease in
the incidence of cervical lymph node metastases
(p = 0.04; Fisher exact test of independence). In the
control group, 42 of the 66 (63.6%) lymph nodes
evaluated revealed metastatic tumors, while in the
rapamycin-treated group only 31 of the 68 (45.6%)
lymph nodes evaluated showed metastasized tumors.
This shows that the incidence of cervical lymph
node metastases decreased by almost one third after
rapamycin treatment. Rapamycin also significantly
reduced the extent of tumor spread within the
lymph nodes. In the control group 33 of the 42
(78.6%) lymph nodes with metastatic tumor showed
extensive lymph node involvement. By comparison,
in the rapamycin-treated group only 8 of the 31
(25.8%) lymph nodes with metastatic tumor showed
extensive lymph node involvement, while 74.2% of
the metastatic lymph nodes had only minimal
tumor involvement that was localized to the sub￾capsular sinuses (p = 0.0001; Fisher exact test of in￾dependence; Figure 1E-I and Table 1).
We also assessed the effects of rapamycin on angiogen￾esis by quantitating the number of blood microvessels in
CD31-stained sections of lingual tumor tissue (Figure 2).
At × 400 magnification, the average blood vessel counts
per field (mean ± SD) were: 23.36 ± 5.56 blood microvessels
in control tumors compared to 14.94 ± 3.79 for rapamycin￾treated tumors (p < 0.0001; unpaired t test with Welch
correction). This shows a significant 36% reduction in
blood vessel density following rapamycin treatment.

Interestingly, rapamycin treatment significantly in￾creased the level of soluble VEGFR-2 in serum of SCID
mice compared to control (p = 0.0001; Figure 3).
mTOR inhibition suppresses LEC proliferation and VEGFR￾3 expression
We found significant inhibition of lymphatic endothelial
(LEC) proliferation in both LEC lines at all doses of
mTOR inhibitors tested (1-1000 ng/ml). The growth of
SV-LEC and HMVEC-1A cells were inhibited by >35%
after 72 h (P < 0.05), indicating potent anti-lymphatic
effects of mTOR inhibitors (Figure 4A). Interestingly after
72 h of rapamycin treatment, we noted a modest but sta￾tistically significant increase in a percentage of apoptotic
cells in SV-LEC cell (control samples 6.65 ± 1.50%;
rapamycin-treated samples 10.20 ± 2.46%; p = 0.0099). By
comparison, there was no significant change in percentage
of apoptotic cells for HMEC-1A cell line (control sam￾ples – 5.04 ± 1.39%; rapamycin-treated samples – 6.04 ±
1.99%; p > 0.05). These findings indicate a significantly
higher inhibition of proliferation of SV-LEC cells than
HMEC-1A cells by rapamycin.
The effects of rapamycin on mTOR signaling in LECs
were evaluated by Western Blotting analysis. Inhibition
of mTOR signaling was demonstrated by a significant
decrease in phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 at
Ser235/Ser236 and by a shift of the phosphorylated
isoforms to non-phosphorylated “α” isoform of 4E-BP1
(Figure 4B). Interestingly, treatment with rapamycin de￾creased VEGFR-3 (Flt-4) expression in both LEC and
HNSCC cells. We found a significant inhibition of
VEGFR-3 expression after rapamycin treatment in both
LEC cell lines as well as in two of four HNSCC cell lines
tested, namely SCC40 and PCI-15a (Figure 5). Expres￾sion of the lymphangiogenic growth factor receptor
VEGFR-3 in LEC cells, in SCC40 and PCI-15a HNSCC
cells, was decreased by more than 30% after rapamycin
treatment compared to vehicle-treated control (Figure 5B;
P < 0.05; paired two-tailed t-test). Similarly in our animal
experiments we observed a decrease in VEGFR-3 ex￾pression in lingual tumor tissue from 0.65 ± 0.99 in
control group to 0.36 ± 0.25 in rapamycin-treated
group. However due to high variability results were
not significant (p = 0.177).
Discussion
Dissemination of tumor cells to regional lymph nodes via
the lymphatic system represents the first step in HNSCC
metastasis and is the most important poor prognostic factor
for disease recurrence. Tumor-associated lymphangiogenesis
plays an active role in metastatic disease spread by providing
escape routes for cancer cells and is supported by significant
correlation between intratumoral lymphatic vessel density
and lymph node metastasis [25,26]. HNSCC are highly vas￾cular tumors with remarkable expansion of both blood and
lymphatic vascular networks in head and neck area. In our
previous study we showed an equally high density of blood
and lymphatic vessels in HNSCC patients, underscoring the
fact that HNSCC is not only highly angiogenic, but also
highly lymphangiogenic [20]. Accumulating evidence now
supports rapalogues potent activity against tumor
blood vasculature and we have shown that mTOR in￾hibitors have potent anti-angiogenic effects in HNSCC.

microvessel density by 42% (P < 0.001) [27]. Similarly in
our current study we found a significant 36% inhibition of
blood microvessel density by rapamycin in the HNSCC
orthotopic tumor model as well. Several studies show
rapamycin also exerts anti-lymphangiogenic effects
in vitro [28], blocks in vivo lymphangiogenesis in pancreatic
cancer [29], and reduces regenerative lymphangiogenesis in
a skin flap model [28]. Together these findings underscore
the importance of mTOR-targeted therapy in inhibiting
both tumor angio- and lymphangiogenesis. Unlike blood
vessel angiogenesis, rapalogues effects on tumor-associated
lymphangiogenesis are not well understood, but could pro￾vide critical additional target for mTOR inhibitors in the
treatment of HNSCC. Recently, in the study by Gutkind et
al we demonstrated anti-lymphatic properties of rapalogues
in an orthotopic model of HNSCC generated by injection
of UMSCC2 cells into the tongue of SCID/NOD mice [20].
In this study we obtained further evidence for the anti￾lymphatic properties of mTOR inhibitors employing
OSC-19 orthotopic model of HNSCC and investigated
the mechanisms of rapalogues anti-lymphatic effects
using in vitro and in vivo models.
Treatment of SCID mice with 5 mg/kg of rapamycin
for 16 days significantly lowered lymphatic microvessel
density and significantly reduced lymphovascular inva￾sion and decreased the incidence of cervical lymph node
metastasis compared to vehicle-treated controls. Fur￾thermore, rapamycin significantly suppressed the extent
of metastatic tumor cell spread within the lymph nodes.
Most tumor-positive lymph nodes in the control group
(78%) demonstrated complete replacement of the nor￾mal lymph node architecture with tumor cells. Con￾versely, the majority (74%) of positive cervical lymph
nodes extracted from rapamycin-treated mice demon￾strated only minimal tumor cell spread, with only few
metastatic tumor cells localized to subcapsular sinuses,
an early stage of cervical lymphatic metastasis known as
‘micrometastasis’. This suggests that rapamycin can
delay lymphatogenous metastatic spread in head and
neck cancer, potentially impeding extracapsular exten￾sion of squamous cell carcinoma nodal metastases, a sig￾nificant poor prognostic factor for decreased patient
survival [30].
The results obtained in the animal experiment
employing an orthotopic murine model of HNSCC were
further supported by in vitro study findings. The LEC
proliferation assay showed that mouse and human
lymphatic endothelial cells are highly sensitive to mTOR
inhibitors, which decreases LEC proliferation by >35% in
72h of treatment. Interestingly we observed a moderate,
but significant increase in apoptotic cell death after
rapamycin treatment for a faster proliferating SV-LEC
cell line, but not for HMEC-1A cell line, which showed
only a minimal increase in the number of apoptotic cells.
Potent anti-lymphatic effects of the rapalogues have now
been associated with inhibition of mTOR signaling.
Not only angiogenesis, but lymphangiogenesis too
plays an important role in promoting tumor growth and
metastasis. The lymphatic system is a main conduit for
initial metastasis for many types of solid tumors, includ￾ing head and neck cancer. VEGF-C and VEGFR-3 are
not only expressed by lymphatic EC, but also by a var￾iety of HNSCC cell lines, including the HNSCC cell lines
used in this study (SCC40, FaDu, PCI-15a, OSC-19)
(Figure 5A). The VEGF-C/VEGFR-3 axis plays an im￾portant role in cancer progression through several cellu￾lar pathways [26]. Activation of the VEGF-C/VEGFR-3
axis in lymphatic ECs promotes lymph node metastasis,
while binding of VEGF-C to VEGFR-3 creates a positive￾feedback ‘autocrine loop’ which further enhances VEGF-C
release, to dramatically stimulate cancer cell proliferation
as well as lymphangiogenesis [26]. In our study we found
that rapamycin strongly suppressed VEGFR-3 expression
in both human and mouse lymphatic EC (Figure 5B).
Rapalogues also significantly inhibited VEGFR-3 expres￾sion in several HNSCC cell lines. Because rapalogues
down-regulate VEGFR-3 expression in lymphatic endothe￾lial cells and some HNSCC cells it suggests mTOR inhibi￾tors can suppress this vicious cycle of autocrine growth
stimulation to decrease the number of lymph node metas￾tasis, one of the most important factors contributing to
poor head and neck cancer prognosis and survival. Mech￾anistically, another study coauthored by one of the authors
of this paper showed that rapamycin affects VEGFR-3 pro￾tein expression in LEC cells by inhibiting protein synthesis
and promoting protein degradation of VEGFR-3. Im￾portantly rapamycin did not alter the VEGFR-3 mRNA
level [31].
Another important observation from this study was that
rapamycin significantly increased the level of soluble
VEGFR-2 in serum samples in SCID mice implanted
with HNSCC. We also observed a rapamycin-induced
upregulation in the level of soluble VEGFR-2 in serum
samples of nude mice with FaDu HNSCC xenograft tu￾mors (Ekshyyan O., Moore-Medlin T., Nathan CO; un￾published observation). Recently, a soluble form of
VEGFR-2 (sVEGFR-2) that is produced by alternative
splicing has been identified as an endogenous selective
inhibitor of lymphatic vessel growth [32,33].
In a recent study by Silver et al [33] sVEGFR-2 expres￾sion was found to be inversely correlated with lymphatic
vessel density in head and neck malignant tumors. Inter￾estingly sVEGFR-2 was not expressed in lymphatic ves￾sels, but its expression was specific to the endothelial
cells in blood vessels in both malignant tissue as well as
adjacent normal tissues [34]. Furthermore it was demon￾strated that gene therapy with a splicing variant
esVEGFR-2 that produces soluble VEGFR-2 significantly

suppresses tumor growth and lymph node metastasis in
a mouse mammary cancer model [35].
Because soluble VEGFR-2 binds VEGF-C it may com￾petitively inhibit VEGF-C-induced activation of pro￾lymphangiogenic and angiogenic signaling. sVEGFR-2
release could be used as a potential biomarker of anti￾lymphangiogenic and angiogenic responsiveness in clin￾ical trials of mTOR inhibitors and warrants further
investigation.
Conclusions
Our results demonstrate that mTOR inhibitors potently
inhibit lymphatic proliferation by interfering with ex￾pression of VEGFR-3, an essential lymphatic growth fac￾tor receptor necessary for LEC growth and survival.
Furthermore, our data suggest that mTOR inhibitors
can suppress autocrine and paracrine growth stimulation
of tumor and lymphatic endothelial cells by impairing
VEGF-C/VEGFR-3 axis and release of soluble VEGFR-2.
In an orthotopic murine model of HNSCC rapamycin
significantly suppressed lymphovascular invasion, de￾creased the incidence of cervical lymph node metastasis
and delayed the spread of metastatic tumor cells within
the lymph nodes. Our findings therefore suggest that
mTOR inhibitors can effectively control lymphatogeneous
metastasis, the primary predictor of poor survival in
HNSCC.
