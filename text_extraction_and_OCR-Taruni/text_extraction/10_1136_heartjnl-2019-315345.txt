Abstract
Objective The optimal timing for transplantation is 
unclear in patients with Eisenmenger syndrome (ES). 
We investigated post-transplantation survival and 
transplantation-specific morbidity after heart–lung 
transplantation (HLTx) or lung transplantation (LTx) in a 
cohort of Nordic patients with ES to aid decision-making 
for scheduling transplantation.
Methods We performed a retrospective, descriptive, 
population-based study of patients with ES who 
underwent transplantation from 1985 to 2012.
Results Among 714 patients with ES in the Nordic 
region, 63 (9%) underwent transplantation. The median 
age at transplantation was 31.9 (IQR 21.1–42.3) years. 
Within 30 days after transplantation, seven patients 
(11%) died. The median survival was 12.0 (95% CI 7.6 
to 16.4) years and the overall 1-year, 5-year, 10-year 
and 15-year survival rates were 84.1%, 69.7%, 55.8% 
and 40.6%, respectively. For patients alive 1 year 
post-transplantation, the median conditional survival 
was 14.8 years (95% CI 8.0 to 21.8), with 5-year, 10-
year and 15-year survival rates of 83.3%, 67.2% and 
50.0%, respectively. There was no difference in median 
survival after HLTx (n=57) and LTx (n=6) (14.9 vs 10.6 
years, p=0.718). Median cardiac allograft vasculopathy, 
bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome and dialysis/kidney 
transplantation-free survival rates were 11.2 (95% CI 7.8 
to 14.6), 6.9 (95% CI 2.6 to 11.1) and 11.2 (95% CI 8.8 
to 13.7) years, respectively. The leading causes of death 
after the perioperative period were infection (36.7%), 
bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (23.3%) and heart 
failure (13.3%).
Conclusions This study shows that satisfactory post￾transplantation survival, comparable with contemporary 
HTx and LTx data, without severe comorbidities such as 
cardiac allograft vasculopathy, bronchiolitis obliterans 
syndrome and dialysis, is achievable in patients with ES,
with a conditional survival of nearly 15 years.
Introduction
Eisenmenger syndrome (ES) is the most severe 
expression of any unrepaired congenital cardiac 
defect with a systemic-to-pulmonary shunt. The 
initial left-to-right shunt may result in elevated 
pulmonary vascular resistance and right-to-left/
bidirectional shunt causing cyanosis.1
 Development 
of ES represents a point at which the pulmonary 
vascular disease is irreversible with contraindication 
against closure of the shunt lesion.
Medical therapy with pulmonary vasodilators 
such as endothelin receptor antagonists, phospho￾diesterase-5 inhibitors or prostacyclins may result 
in decreased pulmonary vascular resistance with 
improved exercise capacity and possibly improved 
survival.2–6 However, despite this advance in 
medical treatment in the last decade, transplanta￾tion, either combined heart–lung transplantation 
(HLTx) or lung transplantation (LTx) with concom￾itant cardiac repair, remain the only definitive treat￾ment options available for severely symptomatic 
patients.
Since the 1980s, congenital heart disease 
including ES has been the indication for approxi￾mately 40% of HLTx.7–10 The high rate of HLTx in 
the 1980s peaked in 1989, when almost 300 adult 
and paediatric HLTx procedures were reported to 
the registry of the International Society of Heart 
and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT). The number of 
HLTx procedures has subsequently declined to an 
annual rate of 38–94 for the latest decade, with 58 
HLTx procedures reported in 2016.10 11
Transplantation is usually reserved for increas￾ingly symptomatic patients with ES, as the overall 
survival rate for stable patients managed medi￾cally has been considered comparable to that of 
HLTx.12 13 The optimal timing for transplantation 
is difficult to determine, given that patients who 
survive to adulthood are often well adapted to their 
restricted exercise capacity and may present with 
acute deterioration before considering transplanta￾tion.14 15 And although a risk stratification model 
for these patients are available, the optimal timing 
for transplantation is still debateable.14 The aims of 
the present study were to evaluate Nordic patients 
with ES who underwent transplantation from 1985 
to 2012 in order to describe their overall survival 
and major morbidity-free survival, to aid decision￾making regarding when to list patients for HLTx.
Methods
This was a retrospective, descriptive, multicentre 
study of patients transplanted because of ES. From 
the population-based Nordic Eisenmenger data￾base, data on all transplantations in patients with 
ES were available.16 ES was defined as pulmonary 
vascular disease in the presence of a large non￾restrictive shunt accompanied by cyanosis.1 16–19
The patients were divided into simple pre-tricuspid 
(atrial septal defects (ASD)), simple post-tricuspid 
(ventricular septal defects (VSD), patent ductus

arteriosus (PDA) and aortopulmonary window) and complex 
lesions including ASD, univentricular hearts, transposition of 
the great arteries and truncus arteriosus. The patients’ records 
(each with a unique personal identification number) were cross￾checked with the national death registries providing vital status, 
date of death and cause of death. Follow-up data regarding 
survival and transplantation-specific morbidity were available 
for all patients. Renal insufficiency was defined as decreased esti￾mated glomerular filtration rate (<60mL/min/1.73m2
) and/or 
increased serum creatinine (above the limit of the normal range 
according to local guidelines) over a period of >90 days and/or 
the diagnosis given in the medical chart (retrospective patients). 
End-stage renal insufficiency was defined as the need for dial￾ysis or kidney transplantation (RTx). Systemic hypertension was 
defined as elevated blood pressure requiring medical treatment. 
Follow-up of surviving patients was censored at 31 December 
2015. For the analysis of cause-specific mortality, the term 
‘perioperative death’ was defined as death occurring within 30 
days of transplantation. Supplementary donor data was obtained 
from the Scandia transplant database.20
Ethics
The present study and the Nordic Eisenmenger database were 
registered and approved by appropriate health, ethics and data 
authorities in all participating countries from the Nordic region 
and were registered at clinicaltrials.gov (INCT01976533). All 
data were anonymised when shared across borders. As this was a 
retrospective study evaluating existing data from national regis￾tries and medical records, individual informed consent was not 
required.
Statistics
Continuous variables are presented as mean±SD if normally 
distributed or as median and IQR otherwise. Categorical vari￾ables are presented as frequencies and percentages. Associations 
between categories were evaluated by the χ2
 test or Fisher’s exact 
test, where appropriate. Student’s t-test or the Mann-Whitney 
U-test was used for continuous variables.
For assessing time-to-event rates, Kaplan-Meier analysis was 
used. For survival analysis, all-cause mortality was included. 
The Kaplan-Meier analysis conditioned by surviving the first 
year post-transplantation accounted for left truncation. Survival 
curves were assessed and compared with the log-rank test. 
All statistical analyses were performed with SPSS V.22 (IBM, 
Armonk, New York, USA) and the null hypothesis was rejected 
based on a two-sided p value of <0.05.
Results
Patients
We identified 714 patients with ES in the Nordic countries. In 
the period from 1985 to 2012, 63 of these patients underwent 
HLTx (57 patients, 90.5%) or LTx with concomitant repair of the 
cardiac defect (six patients, 9.5%). All LTx patients underwent 
double-lung transplantation. The procedures were performed in 
five centres throughout the Nordic region, and two transplants 
were performed in other European countries prior to an estab￾lished HLTx programmed in the region. The corrected defects 
were mainly of the simple type (two ASD, two and one) and one 
complex (pulmonary atresia with VSD and major aortopulmo￾nary collateral arteries) (table 1). During the same time period, 
a total of 125 HLTx and 1886 LTx procedures were performed 
in the region.20 Thus, ES was the indication for 3% of all LTx 
and 46% of the HLTx procedures performed during this period.
The median age at transplantation was 31.9 (IQR 21.1–42.3) 
years. Paediatric transplantations (<18 years) accounted for 
13% of the transplantations. The median donor age was 26.5 
(IQR 18.3–39.8) years. Most transplants (n=55, 87%) were 
performed prior to 2006. Of the eight patients transplanted 
in 2006 or later, six (75%) received medical pulmonary vaso￾dilator therapy prior to transplantation. The median duration 
of pretransplantation advanced therapy was 5.0 (IQR 1.1–7.1) 
years.

Figure 2 Kaplan-Meier curve illustrating post-transplantation survival. The median proportion of patients with ES who underwent 
transplantation during the period was 0.37% (IQR 0.19%–
0.73%), with the highest annual proportion of 2.1% in 1994 
(figure 1). Demographic data, patient characteristics and 
pretransplant evaluation are presented in table 1.
No patients were transplanted urgently from mechanical circu￾latory support. Waiting time to transplantation was less than a 
year in 30 patients (48%). Ischaemic time was below 4hours in 
65% of patients (table 2). Information about induction therapy 
with antithymocyte globulin and maintenance immunosuppres￾sion are available in table 2.
Survival
A total of 39 deaths (62%) occurred during the study of which 
seven (11%) were perioperative deaths within 30 days of trans￾plantation; 55 patients (87%) were discharged from hospital 
alive. The crude 1-year survival rate was 86%. Median survival 
post-transplantation was 12.0 (95% CI 7.6 to 16.4) years, with 
1-year, 5-year, 10-year and 15-year survival rates of 84.1%, 
69.7%, 55.8% and 40.6%, respectively (figure 2). The median 
survival conditioned by surviving the first year after transplanta￾tion was 14.8 (95% CI 8.0 to 21.8) years, with 5-year, 10-year 
and 15-year survival rates of 83.3%, 67.2% and 50.0%, respec￾tively (figure 2).
There was no difference in median survival after HLTx and 
LTx (12.0 vs 10.9 years, log-rank p=0.718). Likewise, there 
was no difference in survival between complex (median survival 
14.7 years) and simple defects (median 11.5 years, p=0.845), 
between paediatric and adult transplantations (7.6 vs 13.4 years, 
p=0.59), or between centres (median 5.5–18.5 years, p=0.128). 
No data were available on the number of patients that died while 
waiting for transplantation. None of the patients underwent 
retransplantation.
Transplantation-related morbidity
Typical transplantation-related morbidity was observed both 
short and long term (table 3). Almost one-third of the patients 
underwent reoperation within the first week, almost all due to 
haemorrhage (95%), and nearly half were treated for allograft 
rejection within the first year. More than one in five persons 
were diagnosed with cancer, of which 60% were non-skin 
cancers. Nine patients (14%) developed end-stage renal insuf￾ficiency and required dialysis; four patients (6%) later received 
RTx. Over 10% developed cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) 
and 37% developed bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS). 
More than half of the patients were treated for systemic hyper￾tension (table 3).
Median CAV, BOS, dialysis/RTx and non-skin malignancy-free 
survival rates were 11.2 (95% CI 7.8 to 14.6) years, 6.9 (95% 
CI 2.6 to 11.1) years, 11.2 (95% CI 8.8 to 13.7) years and 11.2 
(95% CI 8.1 to 14.4) years, respectively. Survival with freedom 
from the composite of all of the endpoints above was 5.5 (95% 
CI 2.3 to 8.8) years. For patients surviving 1year after trans￾plantation, the conditional CAV, BOS, renal dialysis/RTx and 
non-skin malignancy-free survival rates are shown in figure 3. 
Conditional survival with freedom from the composite of all the 
endpoints above was 6.8 (95% CI 3.0 to 10.5) years.
Cause-specific mortality
Cause-specific mortality could be identified from death certifi￾cates or medical records in 37 (94.9%) patients, and 18.9% of 
the deaths were perioperative (table 4). Among the remaining 
deaths, the leading cause of death was infection (36.6%), 
followed by BOS (23.3%). Infections were largely dominated by 
pneumonia (63.3%). Death due to heart failure ranked fourth 
(10%), whereas other causes such as haemorrhage (6.7%), 
rejection (6.7%), organ failure (6.7%), trauma (6.7%) and

Discussion
The main finding of this multicentre study was a median survival 
of 12 years after transplantation in patients transplanted due to 
ES, which is very similar to contemporary heart transplantation 
(HTx) data.10 Second, it indicated that good post-transplantation 
survival without severe complications is achievable in this multi￾morbid group of patients.
Survival
Survival after HLTx in various patients with congenital heart 
disease differs according to pretransplantation diagnosis, with 
patients with ES having the best overall and conditional survival 
compared with patients with congenital heart disease without ES 
and patients with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension.8
Within the group of patients with ES, the present study found 
no variation in survival based on underlying congenital defect in 
accordance with an earlier study.21
A small number of reports on overall survival rates post￾transplantation in patients with ES are available in the litera￾ture.7–9 21–24 For HLTx, 30 days and 1year survival was 80.7% 
and 70.1% compared with 68% and 55.2% for LTx using United 
Network for Organ Sharing/ISHLT Joint Thoracic Registry,22
and in another study from Cambridge, 1-year, 5-year and 
10-year survival rates for ES were 72.6%, 51.3% and 27.6%, 
respectively,21 which is also considerably lower than observed in 
this Nordic cohort. In comparison, the observed survival rates 
in the present study are similar to recent ISHLT data on survival 
after adult HTx25 as well as HTx reported from Scandinavian 
centres within a similar period.26 In contrast, survival after LTx 
ranges from 4.3 to 6.5 years.9 25 However, it should be noted 
that patients in the present cohort were transplanted at a median 
age of 31.9 years, at a somewhat younger age than patients with 
ES from other studies.26–28 This difference could likely have had 
an impact on survival.
In the present study, a difference in survival between HLTx 
and LTx was not confirmed, although only six LTx procedures 
were performed. However, an earlier multicentre study from 
2002, based on data from the ISHLT, including 576 patients 
with ES over a 10-year period, reported a 1-year survival after 
HLTx of 70% as compared with 55% after LTx.22
In recent years, however, and despite findings in the ISHLT 
study,22 bilateral and single LTx procedures with repair of the 
cardiac defect have been advocated for patients with ES in order 
to maximise the use of the scarce donor organ supply. The reality 
is that single-organ transplantation offers much shorter waiting 
times and thus a better chance of transplantation.11 21 23 24
All LTx procedures for ES in the Nordic cohort were performed 
within the latter 15 years of the study period, mirroring the 
international trend.8
However, the notable survival rates after HLTx reported in 
the present study and the procedural difference as suggested by 
the ISLHT data22 merits further multicentre investigations to 
define the best use of organs in patients with ES.
In the current cohort, only few transplantations were 
performed after 2006 when treatment with oral pulmonary 
vasodilators became more widely available.2
 However, whether 
this observation is due to fewer patients suffering from ES,16

Key messages
What is already known about this subject?
► The number of heart–lung transplantations (HLTx) 
has decreased during recent decades. In patients with 
Eisenmenger syndrome, transplantation is usually reserved for 
increasingly symptomatic patients, as the overall survival rate 
for stable patients managed medically has been considered 
comparable with that of HLTx.
What might this study add?
► This is the first population-based study in patients with 
Eisenmenger syndrome who underwent transplantation 
over almost three decades. This study enables us to describe 
overall survival and major morbidity-free survival, to aid 
decision-making regarding listing patients for HLTx. The main 
finding of the study was a median survival of 12 years after 
transplantation, which is very similar to contemporary heart 
transplantation (HTx) data. Second, it indicated that good 
post-transplantation survival without severe complications is 
achievable in this multimorbid group of patients.
How might this impact on clinical practice?
► These findings illustrate that satisfactory post-transplantation 
survival, comparable with contemporary HTx and lung 
transplantation data, without severe comorbidities such 
as cardiac allograft vasculopathy, bronchiolitis obliterans 
syndrome and dialysis, is achievable in patients with 
Eisenmenger syndrome. This may be of interest and use to 
cardiologists and researchers within congenital heart disease 
and transplantation in order to plan future clinical service as 
well as research areas.
improved condition of patients with ES resulting in fewer listings 
for transplantation or merely the result of the prioritised organ 
expenditure or a coincidental finding cannot be distinguished 
from the present study. Recent reports have also indicated that 
treatment with pulmonary vasodilators in ES may substantially 
delay the need for HLTx and may also have a positive effect 
on survival.6 13 The current data indicate that survival after 
transplantation in patients with ES are better than previously 
reported; however, this post-transplantation survival is similar 
to the reported survival of patients with ES treated with pulmo￾nary vasodilators.15 And even though one may argue that the 
patients with ES on pulmonary vasodilator therapy and the 
transplanted patients with ES are from two different eras, any 
treatment option without the severe morbidities following trans￾plantation, ought to be exploded prior to transplantation. Still, 
only 75% of the patients in the present cohort transplanted after 
2006 received pulmonary vasodilators prior to transplantation. 
Furthermore, approximately 75% of the current cohort had rela￾tive anaemia according to the suggested optimal relationship29
prior to transplantation, which is an acknowledged cause of 
poor functional level.
Although the present data do not elucidate these findings, it 
could be hypothesised that the increased awareness of the pitfalls 
of routine phlebotomy, including iron deficiency and thrombo￾genicity, alongside an increasing focus on iron supplement and 
the use of pulmonary vasodilators, may be contributory to the 
fading rate of transplantation for ES.
Transplantation-related morbidity
Although data exists on long-term complications and 
complication-free survival after HLTx due to congenital heart 
disease, idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension and cystic 
fibrosis,7–10 the present study is the first study devoted solely to 
patients with ES. Confirming data after LTx for all diagnoses,7 9 10
BOS was the major factor determining long-term graft outcome. 
BOS was diagnosed in more than one-third of the patients and 
the cause of death in almost one-fifth, suggesting failure of the 
pulmonary graft rather than the cardiac graft.
Dialysis/RTx was much more frequent in the present study 
than in previous reports (23% vs 0%–4%), although the propor￾tion of patients with renal dysfunction (22%–42%) was quite 
similar between the studies.7–10 Given that most transplantations 
were performed more than a decade ago, calcineurin inhibitor￾free regimens, typically based on everolimus, were not used 
in this cohort. Contrarily, CAV and non-skin cancer had little 
impact on comorbidity-free survival in the present study as well 
as in previous studies. Non-severe comorbidities such as hyper￾tension were less frequent in the present study despite a longer 
follow-up compared with other studies.7–10
Cause-specific mortality
After the perioperative period, more than one-third of the 
deaths were due to infections and more than half the deaths 
were due to either infections or BOS. Susceptibility to infections 
after any solid organ transplant is usually attributed to immu￾nosuppression and the infection is typically caused by bacteria 
or viruses common in the community. However, infections are 
also a frequent cause of death in non-transplanted patients with 
ES,29 accounting for almost 30% of the deaths in these patients. 
Although CAV was diagnosed in almost 10% of the patients, it 
was not the primary cause of death in any patient, corroborating 
data from an earlier study on transplantation in patients with 
ES.21
Strengths and limitations
The present study was based on data from the Nordic Eisen￾menger cohort with a large population-based design.16 In the 
Nordic countries, the implementation of a system with indi￾vidual unique personal identification numbers and a social 
structure allowing general access to free, qualified healthcare 
and population-based validated registries creates a unique
opportunity for the long-term follow-up of large numbers of 
patients. In addition, the extensive Nordic registries provide 
reliable outcome data on all citizens, thus, minimising ‘informa￾tive censoring’ and strengthening survival analysis. In addition, 
the Nordic registries diminish the risk of reporting bias where 
only good results are reported, as all procedures regardless of 
outcome are registered.
This study, however, has obvious limitations due to the nature 
of its design as retrospective data were collected from several 
centres in the Nordic countries over a long period with different 
strategies for treatment and follow-up. Further on, although 
the study is population based and include all patients from the 
Nordic region, larger registry-based studies on the outcome after 
transplantation in this patient group are available in the litera￾ture.7–9 21–24
As in all retrospective studies reporting on cause-specific 
mortality, the validity of the cause of death was dependent on 
the reporting physician at the time of death. During the study 
period of 25 years, the classification and investigations of the 
cause of death may have changed and the autopsy frequency 
could have decreased, which may have introduced a bias.

Congenital heart disease
Conclusion
This study shows that post-transplantation survival with a low 
incidence of severe transplant-related morbidities such as CAV, 
BOS, dialysis and non-skin cancer is achievable in patients with 
ES, with a conditional survival of nearly 15 years. In carefully 
selected patients with ES, HLTx and LTx with cardiac repair 
remain viable treatment options with acceptable outcomes.
