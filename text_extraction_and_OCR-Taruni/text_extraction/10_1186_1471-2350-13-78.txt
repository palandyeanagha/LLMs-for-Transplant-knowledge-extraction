Abstract
Background: In recent genetic association studies, common variants including rs12917707 in the UMOD locus have
shown strong evidence of association with eGFR, prevalent and incident chronic kidney disease and uromodulin
urinary concentration in general population cohorts. The association of rs12917707 with end-stage renal disease
(ESRD) in a recent case-control study was only nominally significant.
Methods: To investigate whether rs12917707 associates with ESRD, graft failure (GF) and urinary uromodulin levels
in an independent cohort, we genotyped 1142 ESRD patients receiving a renal transplantation and 1184 kidney
donors as controls. After transplantation, 1066 renal transplant recipients were followed up for GF. Urinary
uromodulin concentration was measured at median [IQR] 4.2 [2.2-6.1] yrs after kidney transplantation.
Results: The rs12917707 minor allele showed association with lower risk of ESRD (OR 0.89 [0.76-1.03], p = 0.04)
consistent in effect size and direction with the previous report (Böger et al, PLoS Genet 2011). Meta-analysis of
these findings showed significant association of rs12917707 with ESRD (OR 0.91 [0.85-98], p = 0.008). In contrast,
rs12917707 was not associated with incidence of GF. Urinary uromodulin concentration was lower in recipients￾carriers of the donor rs12917707 minor allele as compared to non-carriers, again consistent with previous
observations in general population cohorts.
Conclusions: Our study thus corroborates earlier evidence and independently confirms the association between
UMOD and ESRD.

Background
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a significant and
increasing global challenge for public health. It affects
 10% of the general population in industrialized
nations, incurring high morbidity and mortality, and
posing a substantial financial burden to the health care
systems [1-3]. It is a complex, multifactorial disorder
with an important genetic component. Identification of
the genetic variants involved in its susceptibility and
progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) will
improve our understanding of biological mechanisms
underlying renal function and will ultimately lead to
development of novel tools for diagnosis, prevention,
prediction and treatment [4-6].
Recent advances in genome-wide association (GWA)
studies of kidney disease resulted in discovery of several
genes. Among them a prominent place is taken by
UMOD which has been reproducibly identified in mul￾tiple cohorts as one of the top loci associated with renal
function parameters [7-10]. Several GWA studies high￾lighted a region upstream from the UMOD gene con￾taining rs12917707 and several other SNPs in high
linkage disequilibrium (LD). The mentioned LD block
was repeatedly shown to be associated with prevalent
and incident CKD, and also uromodulin urinary concen￾tration. All the studies showed a consistent trend of

association of the rs12917707 minor allele with lower
risk of CKD [7,11-15], and the minor alleles of SNPs in
perfect LD with rs12917707, rs4293393 and rs13333226,
were associated with lower urinary uromodulin levels
[11,15].
A recent study examined the role of rs12917707 geno￾type in risk for a more severe renal phenotype, ESRD,
with the minor allele again showing a protective effect:
OR [95% CI] 0.92 [0.86-1.0] [14]. However, the level of
statistical significance was only nominal (p = 0.04), war￾ranting further investigation to confirm the association
of the UMOD variants with kidney damage phenotypes.
We thus analyzed the association of rs12917707 with
ESRD and with graft failure (GF) after kidney transplant￾ation, and investigated the effect of rs12917707 genotype
on urinary uromodulin levels.
First, we performed a case-control study where cases
were 1142 ESRD patients receiving transplantation and
controls were 1184 kidney donors (a flowchart of the
participants selection is shown in Figure 1). Second, to
analyze whether UMOD affects long-term kidney trans￾plant function, we performed a survival association ana￾lysis of donor rs12917707 genotype impact on incidence
of GF in 1066 renal transplant recipients.
The UMOD gene expression product is uromodulin,
also known as Tamm-Horsfall protein, which is excreted
with urine, easily measurable [16-18] and thus presents
a perfect intermediate phenotype for genetic association
research. As the UMOD gene is expressed exclusively in
the kidney, it was assumed that it was kidney genotype
that was associated with urinary uromodulin in the pre￾vious reports [11-13,15]. To prove it, we aimed to inves￾tigate whether this association holds after the kidney is
transplanted.
Methods
Study population
This study was conducted in the REGaTTA cohort
[19,20]. Briefly, from all renal transplantations carried
out in our center between 1993 and 2008 we included
1142 first graft recipients and 1186 donors (1066
matched donor-recipient pairs) for the present genetic
study. The exclusion criteria were: re-transplantation,
combined kidney/pancreas or kidney/liver transplant￾ation, technical problems, absence of DNA and loss of
follow-up. A flowchart of the study participants selection
is shown in Figure 1. After transplantation the recipients
were followed up for median [IQR] 5.5 [2.9–8.8] years
and immunosuppression regimen, clinical and laboratory
parameters, and time to GF were documented. GF was
defined as return to dialysis or re-transplantation and
was censored for death with a functioning graft. Patients

and laboratory data were retrieved from medical
records. The Institutional Review Board of the Univer￾sity Medical Center Groningen approved the study
protocol. Informed consent was given by all transplant
recipients and living donors. For deceased donors, with
research carried out after the organ removal and im￾plantation, no consent was required. According to
Dutch law general consent for organ donation and
transplantation includes consent for research projects.
The study was conducted according to the principles of
the Declaration of Helsinki. All the genetic and clinical
data were anonymized prior to analyses.
DNA isolation and genotyping
DNA was extracted from peripheral whole blood (in
recipients and living donors) or lymph nodes/spleen
lymphocytes (in deceased donors) using a commercial
kit following the manufacturer’s instructions, transferred
into 2 ml Eppendorf tubes and stored at -20°C. Absorb￾ance at 260 nm was measured with NanoDrop spectro￾photometer (ND-1000, NanoDrop Technologies) and
DNA concentration was calculated by the NanoDrop
nucleic acid application module. As a measure of DNA
purity 260/280 and 260/230 absorbance ratios were
assessed. Where samples failed to meet the minimum
DNA concentration and purity recommended for Illu￾mina genotyping, repeated isolation attempts were made.
Genotyping of the rs12917707 SNP in the UMOD locus
was performed using the Illumina VeraCode GoldenGate
assay kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA), according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. Genotype clustering and
calling were performed using BeadStudio Software (Illu￾mina). Genotyping was unsuccessful in two individuals.
Uromodulin measurement
For 282 outpatient renal transplant recipients at median
[IQR] 4.2 [2.2-6.1] years post-transplant, 24 h urine sam￾ples were available at storage. Uromodulin concentration
was measured by a commercially available enzyme￾linked immunosorbent assay kit (MD Bioproducts, St.
Paul, MN, Tamm-Horsfall Glycoprotein ELISA, catalog
number M036020) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. For this assay, the interassay coefficient of
variation is 10.5% at a mean concentration of 21.8 ng/
mL and 12.2% at 95.1 ng/mL; the sensitivity is less than
0.75 ng/mL. The principle of the assay is based on a col￾orimetric sandwich immunoassay utilizing a polyclonal
antibody against human uromodulin as the capture anti￾body and a biotinylated polyclonal antibody against
human uromodulin as the detection antibody. Immedi￾ately after the ELISA procedure absorbance reading was
performed at 450 nm. A standard curve was generated
with each set of samples by reducing the data using
4-parameter logistic curve fit. Uromodulin concentration
was calculated from the standard curve.
Statistical analysis
Analyses were performed with PASW Statistics 18.0 (SPSS
Inc., Chicago, IL) and PLINK v1.07 (S. Purcell, http://
pngu.mgh.harvard.edu/purcell/plink/ [21]). QUANTO
v1.2.4 (http://hydra.usc.edu/gxe/) and PASS v11 were used
for power estimation.
Deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was tested
in donors. Two individuals (donors), in which genotyping
of rs12917707 was unsuccessful, were excluded and subse￾quent statistical analyses were performed on a final sample
of 2326 subjects in a case-control design (1142 recipients
vs 1184 donors) and 1066 matched donor-recipient pairs
in a longitudinal design.
Genotype-phenotype associations were tested under
an additive genetic model and results (regression coeffi￾cients and p-values) are reported per copy of the minor
allele.
Since we tested the hypothesis that the minor
rs12917707 allele is associated with reduced risk,
such a priori directional prediction allowed us to
assume statistical significance at a one-sided p = 0.05.
Also in the reference paper [14] one-sided p values were
presented.
With one-sided p = 0.05, assuming an additive genetic
model and MAF of 20%, we had approximately 90% and
40% power to detect an OR of 0.8 and 0.9, respectively,
in the ESRD case-control analysis, and 47% and 18%
power to detect a HR of 0.8 and 0.9, respectively, in the
longitudinal analysis of graft survival.
As in 164 (14%) cases transplantation was performed
from living blood-related donors, the PLINK DFAM
algorithm was used to account for relatedness in the
case-control analysis.
We performed a fixed effects inverse variance meta￾analysis to combine the results of our case-control study
and the previously published one [14].
The effect of genotype on graft survival was investi￾gated with Cox regression analysis including as covari￾ates known predictors of GF (donor and recipient age
and sex, donor type, ischemia times, delayed graft func￾tion and acute rejection episodes history, immunosup￾pression regimen).
To study association between genotype and uromodu￾lin urinary levels after transplantation, due to small
number of individuals homozygote for the minor allele,
genotypes were combined into two groups: minor allele
carriers (heterozygotes and homozygotes for the minor
allele) and non-carriers (homozygotes for the ancestral
allele). Statistical significance of differences between the
groups was tested with a Mann-Whitney U test.

Results
Patient characteristics are presented in Table 1. There
was no deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in
controls (p = 0.49). The rs12917707 minor allele fre￾quency (MAF) in the overall sample was 17.3%, compar￾able to HapMap data and previous publications [7,8,14].
The MAF was 18.2% and 16.5% in kidney donors and
ESRD patients, respectively. In the additive genetic
model, adjusted for age, sex and case-control related￾ness, OR [95% CI] for ESRD was 0.89 [0.76-1.03] per
copy of the minor allele, one-sided p = 0.04, which is
direction-consistent with the previously published associ￾ation results [14]. A meta-analysis of our results and those
of the abovementioned study [14] showed a significant as￾sociation of rs12917707 with ESRD: OR [95% CI] 0.91
[0.85-98], p = 0.008 (Figure 2). There was no interaction
between rs12917707 and age or sex (p = 0.92 and p = 0.97,
respectively). We did not observe association between
rs12917707 genotype and any of the underlying etiology of
ESRD (Additional file 1: Table S1).
During a median [IQR] 5.5 [2.9-8.8] years of follow￾up, 172 (16.1%) cases of death-censored GF occurred
and 183 (17.1%) patients died with a functioning graft.
Donor kidney rs12917707 MAF was higher in subjects
with a functioning graft as compared to cases that suf￾fered death-censored GF (18.7% vs 17.2%, respectively).
There was no significant association between donor
rs12917707 and GF as in a univariate Cox regression
analysis hazard ratio (HR) [95% CI] for GF was 0.92
[0.69-1.23], p = 0.57. A multivariate Cox regression
model adjusted for known predictors of graft survival
(Additional file 1: Table S2) showed a HR [95% CI] 0.96
[0.72-1.28], p = 0.76. Exclusion of cases with ≤1 year graft
survival use did not change the results. Recipient
rs12917707 also was not associated with GF (HR [95%
CI] 1.04 [0.78-1.38], p = 0.788).
In a subset of renal transplant recipients (n = 282), in
which 24-h urine collected at median [IQR] 4.2 [2.2-6.1]
years post-transplant was available for uromodulin mea￾surements, donor rs12917707 genotypes distribution
was 4 / 94 / 184, correspondingly, MAF was 18.0%. Uro￾modulin concentrations ranged from 0.3 to 42.6 μg/ml,
median [IQR] 8.6 [5.8-13.3] μg/ml, and were significantly
lower in carriers of the rs12917707 minor allele in the
donor genotype as compared to non-carriers: 7.3 [5.4-
10.8] and 9.4 [6.4-15-6] μg/ml, respectively (p = 0.007)
[Additional file 1: Figure S1]. Recipient rs12917707 was
not associated with uromodulin urinary levels (p = 0.43).
Discussion and conclusion
Thus, we have independently confirmed the association
between UMOD rs12917707 and ESRD in a large case￾control study. It was of similar direction and magnitude
as previously reported [14], and in a meta-analysis of
our results and the cited data convincing statistical sig￾nificance was reached.
We did not find an association between rs12917707
genotype and etiology of ESRD. This suggests a univer￾sal, non-specific effect of the SNP on renal function de￾cline irrespectively of underlying primary disease. A
previous study described interaction between UMOD
variant rs4293393 (in perfect LD with rs12917707) and
age [12]. We, however, did not observe interaction with
age or sex in our population.

Importantly, the observed relationship of the UMOD
variant with ESRD in native kidneys did not translate
into association with renal function loss in the trans￾planted kidney as we did not find an association between
the donor rs12917707 and GF. Although the SNP effect
on GF was direction-consistent with the case-control
analysis and suggestive of a protective trend, the results
were not statistically significant. It might indicate true
absence of an association and differential involvement of
UMOD in the pathophysiology of native and trans￾planted kidneys, or point to the fact that our longitu￾dinal study was underpowered to detect the genetic
effect due to the moderate sample size.
Remarkably, uromodulin urinary levels in patients
after renal transplantation were associated with donor
UMOD rs12917707 genotype. The subset of transplant
recipients, in which urinary uromodulin was studied,
was representative of the whole sample in terms of MAF
and genotypes distribution. Uromodulin concentrations
were significantly lower in recipient-carriers of the donor
rs12917707 minor allele as compared to non-carriers.
Thus, the genetic effect on uromodulin urinary level that
was previously found in the native kidneys was repro￾duced in the transplanted kidneys, with similar direction
of effect. This implies that it is indeed the UMOD geno￾type of the kidney that associates with uromodulin
production.
Several arguments support the genetic analysis of a
kidney transplant cohort. First, a case-control study with
kidney donors, instead of the general population, as con￾trols may have augmented statistical power to reveal the
subtle genetic effects expected from common variants.
Second, a transplant population provides the opportun￾ity to study renal function loss in both native and
transplanted kidneys through investigation of ESRD
before and GF after transplantation. Finally, uniqueness
and elegance of a transplantation setting is that it
enables to test effects of both recipient and donor geno￾type on phenotype and thus discriminate between local
(intra-renal) and systemic (extra-renal) processes.
The strengths of our study include the cohort’s size, its
wide spectrum of underlying primary kidney disease and
the specific design. However, some limitations deserve
to be mentioned. Our longitudinal study may have been
underpowered to detect significant SNP effect on GF.
Power limitations also exist for the analysis of specific
ESRD etiologies. Further, the analysis of the risk for
ESRD is cross-sectional and needs to be confirmed by
longitudinal studies studying incident ESRD. Unfortu￾nately, the design and performance of such studies in
CKD patients is challenging, and thus these are only
emerging [22-24]. We did not have information on
patients ethnicity, however, a reliable estimate for an
average patient population in our region is that over
90% of the individuals are of European ancestry. Subse￾quently, our results are not generalizable to other ethni￾cities. Urinary uromodulin in renal transplant recipients
was measured at different time points ranging from 1 to
9 years after transplantation. For those patients with
presence of residual native kidney function, we cannot
exclude a possible confounding effect of recipient
rs12917707 genotype on urinary uromodulin concentra￾tion. However, this would have biased results to a null
effect, while we have detected a significant association.
In summary, we have independently confirmed the
association between genetic variation at the UMOD locus
and ESRD. Also, donor kidney genotype was significantly
associated with urinary uromodulin concentration in renal

transplant recipients providing evidence that genetic
make-up of the kidney determines this intermediate
phenotype. Further research, including targeted sequen￾cing of the region, bioinformatic analyses and functional
experiments, is required to unravel the mechanisms by
which common genetic variation at UMOD cause kidney
disease.
