Abstract
Background: Chronic renal diseases are currently classified based on morphological similarities
such as whether they produce predominantly inflammatory or non-inflammatory responses.
However, such classifications do not reliably predict the course of the disease and its response to
therapy. In contrast, recent studies in diseases such as breast cancer suggest that a classification
which includes molecular information could lead to more accurate diagnoses and prediction of
treatment response. This article describes how we extracted gene expression profiles from
biopsies of patients with chronic renal diseases, and used network visualizations and associated
quantitative measures to rapidly analyze similarities and differences between the diseases.
Results: The analysis revealed three main regularities: (1) Many genes associated with a single
disease, and fewer genes associated with many diseases. (2) Unexpected combinations of renal
diseases that share relatively large numbers of genes. (3) Uniform concordance in the regulation of
all genes in the network.
Conclusion: The overall results suggest the need to define a molecular-based classification of
renal diseases, in addition to hypotheses for the unexpected patterns of shared genes and the
uniformity in gene concordance. Furthermore, the results demonstrate the utility of network
analyses to rapidly understand complex relationships between diseases and regulated genes.

Background
The rapid development of molecular biology and
powerful analytical methods such as network analysis
are enabling a shift in our understanding of diseases
from a morphological (based on clinical and histological
findings) to a molecular basis. This shift in focus has led
to improvements in the classification of diseases [1,2].
For example, gene expression analyses have been shown
to improve prediction of treatment response in diseases
such as breast cancer [3-5] and leukemia [6].
Unfortunately, relatively little is known about how renal
diseases are similar and different at the molecular level.
Currently, renal diseases are classified largely on mor￾phological similarities. For example, systemic lupus
erythematosus (SLE) is classified as a “predominant”
inflammatory disease based on clinical findings, whereas
focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) is classi￾fied as a “predominant” non-inflammatory disease based
on histology. Several studies suggest that such morphol￾ogy-based classifications could be significantly improved
through the analysis of similarities and differences in
gene expression, leading to more accurate diagnosis and
targeted treatment options [4,6,7].
The analysis of gene expressions in chronic renal disease
has either been studied at the level of a single renal disease
[8], or by studying gene expressions across all known
Mendelian disorders in the OMIM database [9]. The
former obviously cannot reveal gene expressions that are
common across renal diseases; the latter analyzed renal
genes based on limited data, and at a high level
(glomerular versus tubular), and therefore excluded impor￾tant disease subcategories such as SLE. This article
attempts to directly address the lack of understanding
about gene expressions in chronic renal diseases. By using
new data at the appropriate level of granularity, our goal
was to evaluate the current classification of renal diseases,
and generate hypotheses about the molecular mechan￾isms underlying those diseases.
We begin by describing how we assembled a dataset of
renal diseases and implicated genes, why and how we
represented it using networks, and how we analyzed the
networks using visualizations and quantitative measures.
We then discuss how the network analysis rapidly
revealed unexpected overlaps of genes across the
diseases. We conclude by discussing the utility of the
network analysis approach to rapidly understand com￾plex relationships, and the need to define a molecular￾based classification of chronic renal diseases.
Methods
Our research began with the question: What are the
molecular similarities and differences between chronic renal
diseases? If gene expressions occur in patterns that match
the current classification of renal disease, then we can
infer that the current classification is sufficient. However,
if diseases have unexpected gene expression similarities,
then we can infer that the current classification of renal
diseases needs re-evaluation. To address our research
question, we made critical decisions regarding data
selection, data representation and data analysis as discussed
below:
Data selection
Gene expression data were obtained from 106 patients
with one of seven chronic renal diseases (classified in
three categories as shown in Table 1) and compared to
similar data obtained from biopsies of healthy kidney
donors (control). Due to the rarity of three diseases
(MCD, TMD, and DN) they currently have very small
sample sizes (less than five) in the experimental and/or
control conditions.
Microdissected renal tubuli in the biopsies underwent
gene expression analysis of 12029 genes in each sample
using Affymetrix HG-U133A microarrays. This analysis
was done to identify the significantly regulated genes
compared to pre-transplant living donor kidney tissues
(controls) in each disease. A gene was considered to be
significantly regulated in a disease if: (1) the difference
of the normalized expression values between control and
disease samples was significant at the 0.05 level (after
correcting for multiple testing with the false discovery
method), and (2) the regulation effect size (as defined by
the log2 fold change standardized by a pooled standard
deviation) of that gene exceeded +0.3 (for up-regulated)

These statistical comparisons between experimental and
controls were made within the same expression analysis
batch to control for variations in equipment and context.
The rigorous controls and tests resulted in a dataset of
747 genes significantly implicated in 7 renal diseases.
Data representation
Networks [10] have been used to represent a wide range
of molecular phenomena related to human diseases
[11]. These include networks to represent gene regula￾tion [12], protein-protein interaction (PPI) [13], dis￾eases-gene associations [9,14], and disease-protein
associations [15,16]. Idekar and Sharan [15] identified
four possible goals for the analysis of such disease
networks: (a) identify network properties of disease
genes such as the degree of differentially expressed
proteins within a PPI network [17], (b) predict the role
of disease-causing genes based on their relationship with
existing known genes and proteins [18], (c) identify
additional genes associated with particular diseases by
analyzing the PPI network of known disease-causing
proteins [19], and (d) identify highly predictive biomar￾kers that can be used to classify patients (e.g., those that
have or do not have a disease) by identifying sets of
biomarkers that are grouped within PPI networks [2].
However, none of these studies have used networks to
analyze the similarities and differences between renal
diseases based on significantly differentially regulated
genes.
A network is a graph consisting of nodes and edges;
nodes represent one or more types of entities (e.g.,
diseases or genes), and edges between the nodes
represent a specific relationship between the entities
(e.g., a disease is significantly correlated with a gene).
Figure 1 shows a bipartite network (where edges exist
only between two different types of entities) of diseases
and their implicated genes. As shown, the bipartite
network visually represents the explicit relationships
between the 7 renal diseases and the 747 expressed
genes. Furthermore, the size of a node is proportional to
its degree (number of edges that connect to that node).
Therefore, the larger a node, the more edges it shares
with other nodes. Finally, the light edges (orange
colored) and dark edges (blue colored) between diseases
and genes are significantly up and down regulated
respectively.
Networks have three advantages for analyzing complex
relationships. (1) They do not require a priori assump￾tions about the data, such as whether the data are

Fruchterman-Rheingold algorithm [20]) showing the relationship between 7 renal diseases (white nodes), and 747 genes (black

large nodes, whereas diseases with few genes have smaller nodes. The light edges (orange colored) represent up-regulated
genes, the dark edges (blue colored) represent down-regulated genes, and gene node labels are the numerical identifiers for
each gene from the Entrez Gene database. The inset shows that the genes regulated by all four of the high degree diseases (SLE,
FSGS, MGN, and IgAN) are mostly down-regulated (shown as having mostly dark edges), whereas those regulated by a subset
of the diseases shown (SLE, MGN, and FSGS) are mostly up-regulated (shown as having mostly light edges).

hierarchically clustered or contain fuzzy clusters. Instead, by
using a simple pair-wise representation of nodes and edges,
networks enable rapid discovery of complex relationships
using a single representation. (2) The specificity provided
by the pair-wise representation between nodes can reveal
details of relationships, for example how specific diseases
are connected to specific genes. (3) They can be rapidly
visualized and analyzed using a set of network algorithms
to reveal global regularities in the data. For example, Figure
1 shows how a force-directed layout algorithm [20] helps to
visualize the relationship between diseases and genes. The
algorithm pulls together nodes that are tightly connected,
and pushes apart nodes that are not. As shown, the result is
that diseases that share genes (e.g., FSGS and SLE in the
center of Figure 1) are placed close to each other, and close
to their implicated genes. Given these advantages, we used
networks to explore the relationship between renal diseases
and their implicated genes.
Data analysis
The insights from the network visualizations were further
analyzed using two standard network analysis methods.
(1) To quantitatively analyze the overall network
topology observed in the visualization, we calculated
the degree of each gene (number of diseases implicated
with a gene) and plotted the degree distribution of the
genes. (2) To understand more clearly how diseases had
common gene expressions, we transformed the bipartite
network to inspect only how the diseases shared genes in
a method called a one-mode projection [10]. Here, all gene
nodes were removed, and a weighted edge was placed
between two diseases if they shared one or more genes.
The resulting network visually represented how pairs of
diseases shared gene expressions, revealing how two
diseases share more or less genes than expected in
comparison to the current classification of renal diseases.
The networks were created using Pajek (version 1.23) [21].
Results
The bipartite network visualization revealed three critical
patterns related to renal diseases and genes:
Many specific genes, fewer non-specific genes
As shown in Figure 1, there are a large number of specific
genes in the periphery of the network that are connected
to a single disease. These low degree nodes have been
pushed out to the periphery by the force-directed layout
algorithm due to their low connectivity with many
diseases. In contrast, there are relatively fewer non-specific
genes that are in the center of the network due to their
high connectivity to many diseases.
The degree distribution of genes (Figure 2) provides a
quantitative basis for this observation: more than half
(54%) of the total 747 genes are implicated in just one
disease, only two genes (0.3%) are implicated in 5
diseases, and none of the genes are implicated in 6 or all
of the 7 diseases. This result provided the first glimpse
into the pattern of overlap between diseases and
implicated genes. The network in Figure 1 also shows
the low number of overall genes for MCD, TMD, and DN
which have been pushed to the periphery of the graph due
to their low gene overlap. Because each of these diseases
has a low sample size (as shown in Table 1) we removed
them from the dataset to test its effect on the distribution.
As shown in Figure 2, while the number of specific genes
drops, the distribution still shows an overall pattern of
many specific genes and fewer non-specific genes.
Relationship between diseases, genes, and regulation type
The network visualization revealed a multidimensional
relationship between diseases, genes, and regulation
type. As shown in Figure 1, there exist three disease sets
which share a disproportionately large number of genes:
(a) the four dominant diseases (SLE, FSGS, MGN, IgAN)
on the right hand side of the network share 52 (88%) of
the total 4-degree genes. These genes are mainly down￾regulated. (b) A proper subset of the above disease set
(SLE, FSGS, MGN) share 88 (79%) of the total 3-degree
genes. These genes are mainly up-regulated. (c) A pair of

more than half of the genes implicated in one disease
(specific genes), two genes implicated in 5 diseases (non￾specific genes), and none of the genes implicated in all
diseases. The overall pattern of many specific genes and
fewer non-specific genes holds even when 3 diseases with
small sample sizes were excluded from the dataset.

diseases (SLE, FSGS) which overlap with the above sets
share 130 (72%) of the total 2-degree genes. These genes
are mainly up-regulated.
The gene expression overlap between diseases is shown
more clearly by a one-mode projection on diseases. As
shown in Figure 3, the one-mode projection removed the
gene nodes, and placed edges between the diseases to
correspond with how many genes each pair shares. The
one-mode projection shows three dominant pairs of
diseases (SLE-FGS, SLE-MGN, FGS-MGN) that share
many genes. While the projection is not designed to
reveal whether more than two diseases share the same
genes, the network clearly shows the dominant relation￾ship between SLE, FGS, MGN, and a less dominant
relationship with IgAN. Future studies with larger
samples of TMD, DN, and MCD should reveal how
they relate to the other renal diseases.
Uniform concordance in gene regulation
All the genes in the network, regardless of degree, are
concordantly regulated. In other words, no gene was up￾regulated in one disease, and down-regulated in another.
This uniform concordance in gene regulation can be seen
by the large areas of uniform color for edges connecting
to high degree genes. Given the 100% uniformity of gene
concordance, we re-examined the data to check for
programmatic and bias errors, but found none. Further￾more, we examined another dataset containing biopsies
from patients with acute renal failure. When the two data
sets were merged, we found two genes that were
discordantly regulated. This suggests that the uniformity
in gene regulation within chronic renal diseases (pre￾sented here) is most probably the result of similarity in
biological mechanisms across chronic renal diseases,
rather than a selection bias or error. Future research
should further verify this conclusion.

how pairs of diseases share genes. The edge thickness is proportional to the number of shared genes (shown as numbers on
the edges), and the size of the nodes is proportional to the sum of the edge weights incident to that node. Removal of diseases
with small sample sizes (TMD, DN, and MCD) has no effect on the relationship between the other diseases.

Discussion
Given that the data consisted only of the tubular compart￾ment of renal biopsies, we expected to find a large number
of non-specific (shared) genes. Instead, we found relatively
few non-specific renal genes associated with a large number
of diseases. This relationship held even when we removed
diseases with a low sample size. It is important to note that
the many specific genes in our dataset could be implicated
in other renal diseases not included in our study, and
therefore could be non-specific with respect to a wider
scope of diseases. Network analysis therefore helped to
identify which genes might be involved in molecular
mechanisms that are specific to a disease, and which genes
are involved in common pathways activated in combina￾tions of chronic renal diseases. This approach could guide
future research to identify specific and general drug
therapies to treat kidney diseases.
Besides the distribution of specific and non-specific
genes, the network analysis also revealed patterns of
molecular similarity between diseases which do not
match the current morphology-based classification of
renal diseases. As shown in the first column of Table 1,
SLE and IgAN belong to the class of inflammatory
diseases. However, the network analysis revealed that
SLE shares many more genes with FSGS and MGN (from
the non-inflammatory class), compared to IgAN (from its
own class). While molecular similarities between non￾inflammatory and inflammatory renal diseases have
been previously reported [22,23] the unexpected finding
was the strength of the association with members
outside its class. Similarly, IgAN shares an equal number
of genes with SLE (from its own class) as it does with
FSGS, and MGN (from the non-inflammatory class). These
results suggest that the current morphology-based
classification of renal diseases does not match the
pattern of shared tubulo-interstitial gene expression,
and therefore motivates future research to define a new
molecular-based classification of renal diseases.
The above result also motivates future research to
investigate how genes common to sets of disease can
guide the identification of existing or new gene
regulatory pathways [16]. For example, in a preliminary
analysis we used canonical pathways (developed by
Ingenuity® Systems) to search for existing regulatory
pathways that best matched the genes shared by the three
dominant disease sets. For the 59 genes shared by the
disease set FSGS, MGN and IgAN, the search retrieved 45
canonical pathways that were significant at the 0.01
level. Many of these pathways (e.g., TGF-b, JAK/STAT,
NF-B and VEGF) were experimentally-verified in these
diseases. For example, involvement of the VEGF pathway
is suggestive of vascular rarefication as an underlying
driving force for ischemic damage in renal failure [24],
and is a potential biomarker for progressive renal
disease. However, it is possible that shared genes in
our network do not match known pathways, which
would suggest the existence of new pathways yet to be
discovered. These new pathways could be important in
understanding the pathophysiology of the diseases.
Finally, the concordance in gene regulation and the fact
that genes in the three dominant disease sets are either
mostly up or down-regulated suggest that shared
mechanisms have identical effects on gene regulation.
This can be further investigated in the future by
analyzing the properties of the shared genes using
categories from the Gene Ontology database. Patterns
in how the gene categories relate to different disease sets
should lead to an understanding of this and other
phenomena related to the type of gene regulation. The
network analysis therefore led to several testable
hypotheses about the underlying pathophysiological
mechanisms involved in chronic renal disease.
Conclusion
While networks have been used to analyze a wide range of
molecular phenomena, they have not been used to analyze
how genes are implicated in multiple renal diseases. Our
analysis has enabled us to question the adequacy of the
existing morphological based taxonomy of renal diseases.
Furthermore, the analysis rapidly revealed useful biological
insights, without requiring additional filtering to reveal
complex but understandable relationships. This could be
because the network was of medium size and density
compared to many large networks, such as the Gnutella
peer-to-peer file sharing network [25]. In addition, the
resulting network quickly revealed overlapping, nested, and
subset groups from the same representation, a result that
would be difficult using traditional data mining techni￾ques. However, it is important to note that like most data
mining techniques, network analysis is essentially an
exploratory tool, and most useful for generating hypoth￾eses, which need rigorous testing using other techniques to
arrive at definitive answers.
The limitation of the current analysis is the small sample
sizes for three diseases, which new data will soon address.
However, similar to the Diseasome project [9], studies that
attempt to analyze gene expressions of many diseases
simultaneously often have to deal with incomplete data.
Networks are surprisingly useful for incomplete data
because they enable us to visually inspect the data, and
make appropriate choices for filtering and interpretation.
Our future research includes: (1) Using categories from
the Gene Ontology database to annotate the genes in the
BMC Bioinformatics 2009, 10(Suppl 9):S3 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/10/S9/S3

bipartite network, with the goal of understanding why
sets of shared genes have similar regulation type. (2)
Analyzing the data using additional network analytical
techniques [26], such as random network comparison
[27,28] and fuzzy cluster analysis [29,30]. (3) Analyzing
a network consisting of individual patients and
expressed genes. The goal of analyzing individual
patients is to construct a new classification of renal
diseases using a bottom-up approach without the use of
a priori disease classifications as was done in the current
study. As previous research on biomarkers in renal
diseases have stated, gene expression data should lead to
a systematically constructed molecular-based classifica￾tion, resulting in the identification of more targeted
treatments for patients with chronic renal disease.
