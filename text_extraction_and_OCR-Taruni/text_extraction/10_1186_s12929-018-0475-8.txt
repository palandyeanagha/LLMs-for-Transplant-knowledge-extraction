Abstract
Background: Jaundice is a common symptom of inherited or acquired liver diseases or a manifestation of diseases
involving red blood cell metabolism. Recent progress has elucidated the molecular mechanisms of bile metabolism,
hepatocellular transport, bile ductular development, intestinal bile salt reabsorption, and the regulation of bile
acids homeostasis.
Main body: The major genetic diseases causing jaundice involve disturbances of bile flow. The insufficiency of
bile salts in the intestines leads to fat malabsorption and fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies. Accumulation of excessive bile
acids and aberrant metabolites results in hepatocellular injury and biliary cirrhosis. Progressive familial intrahepatic
cholestasis (PFIC) is the prototype of genetic liver diseases manifesting jaundice in early childhood, progressive liver
fibrosis/cirrhosis, and failure to thrive. The first three types of PFICs identified (PFIC1, PFIC2, and PFIC3) represent defects in
FIC1 (ATP8B1), BSEP (ABCB11), or MDR3 (ABCB4). In the last 5 years, new genetic disorders, such as TJP2, FXR, and MYO5B
defects, have been demonstrated to cause a similar PFIC phenotype. Inborn errors of bile acid metabolism also cause
progressive cholestatic liver injuries. Prompt differential diagnosis is important because oral primary bile acid replacement
may effectively reverse liver failure and restore liver functions. DCDC2 is a newly identified genetic disorder causing
neonatal sclerosing cholangitis. Other cholestatic genetic disorders may have extra-hepatic manifestations, such
as developmental disorders causing ductal plate malformation (Alagille syndrome, polycystic liver/kidney diseases),
mitochondrial hepatopathy, and endocrine or chromosomal disorders. The diagnosis of genetic liver diseases has
evolved from direct sequencing of a single gene to panel-based next generation sequencing. Whole exome sequencing
and whole genome sequencing have been actively investigated in research and clinical studies. Current treatment
modalities include medical treatment (ursodeoxycholic acid, cholic acid or chenodeoxycholic acid), surgery (partial biliary
diversion and liver transplantation), symptomatic treatment for pruritus, and nutritional therapy. New drug development
based on gene-specific treatments, such as apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter (ASBT) inhibitor, for BSEP
defects are underway.
Short conclusion: Understanding the complex pathways of jaundice and cholestasis not only enhance insights into
liver pathophysiology but also elucidate many causes of genetic liver diseases and promote the development of
novel treatments.

Background
Jaundice is a common symptom of inherited or acquired
liver diseases of various causes. The underlying bio￾chemical disturbance of jaundice is defined by direct or
indirect hyperbilirubinemia. These two categories may
represent different mechanisms causing jaundice. Indir￾ect hyperbilirubinemia typically results from increased
red blood cell turnover, increased bilirubin loading, or
disturbances in hepatocellular update and bilirubin con￾jugation. Direct hyperbilirubinemia, typically defined as
a direct/total bilirubin ratio of more than 15–20%, or a
direct bilirubin level above 1.0 mg/dL, is collectively de￾fined as cholestasis.
Recent progress in the past two decades has largely
elucidated the molecular mechanisms underlying bile
metabolism (including bilirubin, bile acids, cholesterol,
phospholipid, and xenobiotics metabolism), hepatocellu￾lar transport (including uptake from sinusoidal blood
and export to the canaliculus and bile ducts), bile duct￾ular development, the intestinal reabsorption of bile
salts, and the regulation of bile acids and cholesterol
homeostasis. The understanding of these complex path￾ways not only provides insights into liver physiology but
also elucidates many causes of genetic liver disease and
facilitates the development of novel treatments. This re￾view will focus mainly at hepatobiliary causes of jaundice
and inherited cholestasis.
Main text
The composition and function of bile
The hepatobiliary system comprises the liver, bile duct
and gall bladder. Bile is synthesized and secreted by po￾larized hepatocytes into bile-canaliculi, flows through
bile ducts, stored in the gall bladder and is finally
drained into the duodenum. The main physiological
function of bile is to emulsify the lipid content of food,
and this lipid emulsion facilitates lipid digestion and the
absorption of lipid-soluble substances. Additionally, bile
secretion is an important route to regulate cholesterol
homeostasis, hemoglobin catabolism, and the elimin￾ation of drugs or drug metabolites [1].
Bile is a yellow-to-greenish amalgam of water, bile
acids, ions, phospholipids (phosphatidylcholine), choles￾terol, bilirubin, proteins (such as glutathione and peptides)
and the other xenobiotics [1]. The yellow-to-greenish color
of bile is caused by bilirubin and its derivative, which are
also the origin of stool color. Bilirubin is the end catabolite
of hemoglobin and other heme-containing proteins, such
as myoglobin. The heme molecule is oxidized to biliverdin
in hepatocytes and then reduced to unconjugated bilirubin.
Unconjugated bilirubin is conjugated with one to two
molecules of glucuronic acid via Uridine 5'-diphospho￾glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 (UGT1A1). Bilirubin conjuga￾tion increases water solubility and reduces cytotoxicity of
bilirubin. Hepatic and intestinal UGT1A1 are functionally
reduced in neonatal stages, and hence, unconjugated hyper￾bilirubinemia is commonly found in human neonates [2].
Conjugated bilirubin, or direct bilirubin, is the major form
of bilirubin in bile and is eliminated in stool. Jaundice, a
yellowish pigmentation of the skin and sclera, is caused by
the disrupted excretion of bilirubin and biliverdin. Interest￾ingly, some studies involving neonates or adults have shown
that hyperbilirubinemia is protective against diseases, in￾cluding metabolic syndrome and asthma, [2, 3] suggesting
that bilirubin may play a role as an antioxidant [4].
Bile acids are colorless and are the most abundant or￾ganic components of bile. Bile acids, a group of
detergent-like molecules, are synthesized from choles￾terol and are typically associated with sodium or potas￾sium ions in the form of bile salts. Bile salts mediate
lipid emulsion and act as signaling molecules to regulate
gene expression [5–7]. Phospholipids and cholesterol,
the second and third most abundant organic compo￾nents of bile, protect against injury of the biliary epithe￾lium from bile acids [1].
Biosynthesis and enterohepatic circulation of bile acids
Bile acids can be synthesized from cholesterol via two
pathways in hepatocytes to generate two primary bile
acids, cholic acid (CA) and chenodeoxycholic acid
(CDCA), through cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, in￾cluding CYP7A1, CYP8B1, and CYP27A1. Primary bile
acids are conjugated with glycine or taurine (glyco- or
tauro-conjugated CA and CDCA), with increased solubil￾ity and reduced cytotoxicity. In the intestines, gut-resident
microbiota deconjugate bile salts to generate the second￾ary bile acids, deoxycholic acid (DCA) and lithocholic acid
(LCA) [8, 9]. In human livers, de novo synthesized bile
salts are 500–600 mg daily [10]. More than 90% of bile
acids are reabsorbed at the distal ileum and transported
back to the liver through circulation systems for the next
cycle, called the enterohepatic circulation. Bile salts cycle
6- to 10-times daily. The total amount of bile salt in the
body is called bile acid pool, which is approximately 2–
3 g. In contrast to bile acids, only trace amounts of conju￾gated bilirubin will enter the enterohepatic circulation.
The blockage of enterohepatic circulation to enhance bile
salt elimination has been applied in surgical and medical
treatments for cholestasis (Fig. 1).
In human fetuses after 22 and 26 weeks of gestation,
taurine-conjugated di-hydroxyl bile acids can be de￾tected in the gallbladder. After 28 weeks, small amounts
of glycine conjugates are synthesized. In postnatal stages,
the ratio of CA to CDCA declines from 2.5 to 1.2 [11]. In￾fant livers are under development, have a small bile acid
pool, and have a limited capacity for bile excretion and re￾absorption. Therefore, neonates and infants, particularly
premature infants, are prone to cholestasis caused by

various insults, such as ischemia, drugs, infection, or par￾enteral nutrition.
Hepatocellular transporters mediating bile flow (Fig. 2)
Bile flow is generated by osmotic forces associated with the
amount of bile salts secreted into bile canaliculi. Bile
secretion from hepatocytes is mediated by a group of trans￾port proteins, particularly ATP-binding cassette (ABC) con￾taining proteins. The bile salt export pump (BSEP encoded
by ABCB11) is the pivotal transporter mediating bile acid
transport into bile canaliculi. BSEP is exclusively expressed
in the apical/canalicular membrane of hepatocytes. After
Fig. 1 The enterohepatic circulation, homeostasis of bile acids and treatment targets for cholestasis. The grey arrows indicate the route of
enterohepatic circulation of bile acids. Bile acids are synthesized from cholesterol in hepatocytes to generate the primary bile acids CA and CDCA.
After conjugation with glycine or taurine, bile acids (BAs) are transported from hepatocytes into the bile canaliculi via BSEP. Intestinal microbiota
converts primary bile acids into the secondary bile acids DCA and LCA. Most of BAs reabsorbed by the enterocytes through ASBT in the apical
membrane and then delivered into the portal circulation system via BA efflux transporter OSTα/β in the basolateral membrane. BAs are re-absorbed
into hepatocytes. Hepatocytes secrete these BAs along with the de novo synthesized bile acids enter the next cycle. Bile acids also play roles in
signaling to regulate the homeostasis of bile acids. The nuclear receptor FXR is the bile acid receptor to regulate bile acid homeostasis at the synthesis
and the elimination levels, acting in the hepatocytes and enterocytes. The figure also shows different therapeutic targets at hepatocellular transport
or enterohepatic circulations. 1°BAs, primary bile acids; 2°BAs, secondary bile acids; 4-PB, 4-phenylbutyrate; ASBT, apical sodium dependent bile acid

secreted into the small intestine, bile salts are absorbed into
intestinal cells via the apical sodium-dependent bile acid
transporter (ASBT encoded by SLC10A2) and then secreted
into the circulation system through the basolateral hetero￾dimeric transporter OSTα-OSTβ (encoded by OSTA and
OSTB, respectively) [12–14].
The basolateral/sinusoidal membrane of hepatocytes
contains several bile acid transporters to absorb bile
acids from sinusoidal blood, including Na+
-taurocholate
co-transporting polypeptide NTCP (encoded by
SLC10A1), OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 (encoded by
SLCO1B1 and SLCO1B3, respectively) [12, 15]. OATP1B1
and OATP1B3 also function in the uptake of bilirubin into
hepatocytes [16]. Conjugated bilirubin and organic anions
are transported via canalicular multidrug resistance￾associated protein 2 MRP2 (encoded by ABCC2) and, to a
lesser extent, via ABCG2 into bile. Under physiological or
cholestatic conditions, conjugated bilirubin may be excreted
via MRP3 (encoded by ABCC3) across sinusoidal mem￾branes into blood, to a lesser extent, and reabsorbed by
OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 [3, 16].
Lipids are also important components of bile. The het￾erodimeric transporter ABCG5/8 mediates cholesterol
across canalicular membranes. Phosphatidylcholine (PC) is
flopped by the floppase multidrug resistance P-glycoprotein
3 (MDR3, encoded by ABCB4) to the outer lipid leaflet and
then extracted by bile salts into bile to form micelles. The
combination of cholesterol and sphingomyelin makes
membranes highly detergent resistant [17, 18]. The flippase
FIC1(ATP8B1) is required to flip phosphatidylserine (PS)
back from the outer lipid leaflet to the inner lipid leaflet of
the canalicular membrane to stabilize the integrity of the
canalicular membrane [19]. Additionally, FIC1 is required
for the functional expression of MDR3 [20]. Thus, hepato￾cytes and biliary epithelium are protected from bile acid
toxicity through the efflux of bile acids mediated by BSEP
and the functions of MDR3 and FIC1.
Homeostasis of bile acid pools
The homeostasis of bile acids is tightly controlled by the
de novo synthesis of bile acids and the expression of
transporters that affect hepatocellular bile acid levels. The
key regulating molecules are farnesoid X receptor (FXR,
NR1H4) and membrane-bound Takeda G protein-coupled
receptor (TGR5) [6]. FXR is a nuclear receptor that is
highly expressed in hepatocytes and enterocytes in the dis￾tal small intestine and colon. TGR5 is expressed in enter￾oendocrine cells, gallbladder cells and cholangiocytes.
FXR forms heterodimers with other nuclear receptors to
mediate its transcriptional activity [21–24]. Upon binding
with bile acids as its natural ligands, FXR downregulates
the expression of bile acid synthesis enzymes (mainly

CYP7A1) and the sinusoidal uptake transporter of NTCP
but upregulates the expression of the bile acid efflux trans￾porter BSEP to reduce intracellular bile acid concentra￾tions [25–29]. When bile acids are accumulated in
hepatocytes, activated hepatic FXR increases sinusoidal
bile acid efflux via MRP4 and heterodimeric OSTα/β [30,
31]. FXR also inhibits the expression of the ileal bile acid
transporter ASBT to reduce the enterohepatic circulation
of bile acids [32, 33]. Activation of FXR induces entero￾cytes to release FGF19. Through enterohepatic circulation
via the portal vein, FGF19 translocates to the liver and in￾hibits the expression of CYP7A1 in the hepatocytes [34].
Through FXR, bile is controlled via a negative feedback
loop at the transcriptional level via transporters and bile
acid synthesis systems.
Cholestasis
Cholestasis is defined as disturbances in bile flow caused
by diseases either in the hepatocytes, intrahepatic bile
ducts or extrahepatic biliary system. Cholestatic liver
disease is one of the most common forms of liver disor￾ders resulting from inherited or acquired liver diseases.
Inadequate bile flow of any causes results in accumula￾tion of bile contents, including bilirubin, bile acids, and
lipids in the liver, and consequently cause elevated levels
of bilirubin and bile salts in the liver and blood, as well
as dysregulated lipid metabolisms. Clinically, patients
usually manifest jaundice as a result of hyperbilirubinemia.
Other symptoms include clay stool, pruritus, or infre￾quently, bleeding episodes such as intracranial hemorrhage.
Chronic cholestatic liver disease may progress to liver
cirrhosis and liver failure and is the leading cause of
pediatric liver transplantation. According to the ana￾tomical location of its occurrence, cholestasis is divided
into extrahepatic and intrahepatic cholestasis. Extrahe￾patic cholestasis is caused by structural abnormalities
of the biliary tract including the obstruction of bile
ducts and the gallbladder. Surgical treatments are typic￾ally applied to restore the physiological function. How￾ever, intrahepatic cholestasis is more complicated and
typically requires sophisticated investigations. The com￾mon causes of extrahepatic and intrahepatic cholestasis
are shown in Fig. 3.
Etiologies of inherited bilirubin metabolism disorders
causing indirect hyperbilirubinemia
Disturbances in the bilirubin metabolisms result in accu￾mulation of bilirubin in the liver and blood, and conse￾quently cause hyperbilirubinemia detected by routine
serum biochemistry test, or called jaundice clinically.
Gilbert syndrome is a benign clinical condition usually
present mild intermittent jaundice in children or adult.
TA repeat polymorphism (UGT1A1*28) in the promoter
of UGT1A1 gene is the most commonly affected region.
Gilbert syndrome can be identified in the general popu￾lation, and many are identified by blood test of a health
exam [35].
Crigler-Najjar syndrome is also cause by mutations in
the UGT1A1 gene. Type I is a rare autosomal recessive
disorder with complete loss of enzymatic function that
cause extremely high bilirubin levels (above 20 mg/dL)
and may lead to encephalopathy due to kernicterus.
Treatments include phototherapy, exchange transfusion,
or liver transplantation. Crigler-Najjar syndrome Type II
manifests medium levels of hyperbilirubinemia (around
5–20 mg/dL), with retention of some enzymatic activity.
Phenobarbital can be used intermittently to reduce bili￾rubin levels below 10-15 mg/dL.
Genetic variations in the UGT1A1 gene, especially
211 G to A (G71R in exon 1) mutation, as well as varia￾tions in the glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD)
and OATP2 genes, also contribute to the occurrence of
neonatal jaundice and breast-feeding jaundice [36–38].
Homozygous 211 G to A mutation has been reported to
be associated with severe neonatal jaundice.
Etiologies of inherited cholestasis causing direct
hyperbilirubinemia
Inherited cholestatic liver diseases may manifest early in
life. The presenting age ranges from infancy to young
adulthood. In the last 20 years, there has been tremen￾dous progress in understanding the genetic background
of cholestatic liver disease [39–43]. Table 1 lists the cat￾egories and genes involved in inherited genetic disorders.
Up to now, more than 100 inherited diseases are identi￾fied to cause cholestatic liver diseases with the initial
presentation of jaundice. Some disorders may be asso￾ciated with congenital anomalies or with multiple
organ involvement. We have previously investigated
the genetic background of pediatric patients in Taiwan
with BSEP, FIC1, MDR3 defects [44–47]. We have also
reported adaptive changes of hepatocyte transporters
associated with obstructive cholestasis in biliary atre￾sia, an important extrahepatic cholestatic liver disease

with common symptom of prolonged neonatal jaun￾dice [48, 49]. The distribution of disease types in Tai￾wanese infants with intrahepatic cholestatic liver
diseases is shown in Fig. 4.
Progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC) is a
clinical syndrome with features of chronic intrahepatic
cholestasis that typically begin in infancy and progress
to biliary cirrhosis and hepatic failure by the first or sec￾ond decade of life [40, 46, 50]. The first three types of
genetic defects identified are commonly referred to as
PFIC1, PFIC2, and PFIC3. PFIC1 and PFIC2 are charac￾terized by low serum γ-glutamyltransferase (GGT) levels.
PFIC1 (Byler’s disease) patients have FIC1 gene muta￾tions, and PFIC2 patients have mutated BSEP gene.
PFIC3 is characterized by high serum GGT levels and is
caused by genetic mutations in the MDR3 gene [51, 52].
BSEP plays a pivotal role in bile physiology as it medi￾ates canalicular bile salt export and is the main driving
force of bile flow [53].
With the advances in genetic technologies in recent
years, novel disease-causing genes for PFIC have been
reported. FXR, the key regulator of bile acid metabolism,
have been implicated in a novel form of infant cholesta￾sis with liver failure in two European families [54]. We
also identified a fatal case of infant cholestasis with liver
failure occurring before 3 months of age [55].

Additionally, TJP2 and MYO5B have been found to
cause PFIC. TJP2 is an important component of tight junc￾tions, and a deficiency of TJP2 disrupts the tight-junction
structure in the liver [56]. MYO5B is associated with low
GGT infant cholestasis. MYO5B is an actin-based motor
protein and an effector of Rab11a/b. MYO5B mutations re￾sult in the dysregulation of Rab proteins and further disrupt
the trafficking of BSEP [57, 58]. Doublecortin domain con￾taining 2 (DCDC2), a tubulin-binding protein, is associated
with renal-hepatic ciliopathy and neonatal sclerosing chol￾angitis [59–61]. The mitochondrial transcription factor
TFAM is associated with mitochondrial DNA depletion
syndrome [62]. Recently, a homozygous single nucleotide
deletion in organic solute transporter-β (OSTβ/SLC51B)
was demonstrated to cause congenital diarrhea and chole￾stasis [63].
Dubin-Johnson and Rotor syndrome are two inherited
disorders manifesting direct hyperbilirubinemia but with
normal or minimally elevated alanine transaminase
(ALT) levels, clinically manifesting as jaundice.
Dubin-Johnson syndrome is caused by disruption of
MRP2 and characterized by grossly black livers and pig￾ment deposition in hepatocytes. Neonatal cholestasis
caused by Dubin-Johnson syndrome has been reported
in Taiwan and Japan [64, 65]. Our group has identified
patients recovered from neonatal cholestasis had
re-emergence of jaundice in young adulthood after
long-term follow-up [64]. Rotor syndrome has recently
been identified to be caused by genetic disruption of
both SLCO1B1 and SLCO1B3 genes [66, 67]. These two
disorders are benign and do not require specific
treatment.
Genetic cholestasis not only causes pediatric liver dis￾ease but may also be present in adult liver disease. Add￾itionally, adult liver diseases may result from genetic
liver diseases. In general, protein functional disturbances
are less detrimental and are typically caused by missense
genetic mutations or multifactorial disorders. Cholestasis
in pregnancy has been associated with genetic variants/
mutations in ABCB4, ABCB11, ATP8B1, ABCC2 and
TJP2 [68]. Adult benign recurrent intrahepatic cholestasis
(BRIC) is also associated with PFIC-related genes and may
have mutations that are less damaging [69–72]. Acquired
forms of cholestasis, such as drug-induced liver disease,
have also been associated with genetic variants [73, 74].
Diseases related to ductal plate malformation are an
important group of developmental disorders that lead to
a paucity or malformation of intrahepatic or interlobular
bile ducts. Alagille syndrome, first described by Alagille
et al., is based on clinical diagnostic criteria including a
characteristic face; a paucity of interlobular bile ducts in
liver pathology; and cardiac, eye, and vertebral anomalies
[75]. The JAG1 mutation accounts for > 90% of cases of
Alagille syndrome, and mutations in NOTCH2 have
been described in a minority of patients [76]. Other syn￾dromic disorders and polycystic liver/kidney diseases
may also present with infant cholestasis as the first
symptom.
Cholestasis is a common manifestation of hepatic meta￾bolic disorders, including carbohydrate, amino acid, and fat
metabolism, as well as mitochondrial and endocrine anom￾alies. Most of these diseases are rare disorders, and the dis￾ease incidence largely depends on ethnic background. For
example, neonatal cholestasis caused by citrin deficiency
(NICCD) is an important cause of cholestasis in East Asian
children [77, 78]. We have previously identified facial fea￾tures and biochemical characteristics for the phenotypic
diagnosis of NICCD [79, 80]. Alpha 1-antitrypsin (A1AT/
SERPINA1) deficiency and cystic fibrosis are important
causes in western countries but how lower incidences in
Asian populations.
Inborn errors of bile acid metabolism constitute a
group of important metabolic disorders causing infant
cholestasis. Notably, oral primary bile acid supplementa￾tion is effective and can avoid patient deterioration and
the need for liver transplantation upon timely treatment
[81, 82].
Neonatal hemochromatosis is an important cause of neo￾natal liver failure that manifests as early onset cholestasis.
However, recent studies have elucidated this condition as a
disorder of gestational alloimmune liver diseases instead of
hereditary hemochromatosis [83]. Treatment involves ex￾change blood transfusion and intravenous immunoglobulin
applied as early as when the neonate is born.

Other congenital anomalies, such as chromosomal anom￾alies, endocrine disorders, and developmental disorders
may also cause cholestasis. Liver disease is typically a
multi-organ manifestation of congenital anomalies.
Diagnosis
Clinical history
A careful clinical history is important to investigate
common secondary causes of jaundice and cholestasis,
including hemolytic anemia, G6PD deficiency, hereditary
spherocytosis and other red cell membrane disorders,
prematurity, sepsis, drug-induced liver injury, parenteral
nutrition-associated liver diseases, ischemia, and preg￾nancy. Ethnic background and parental consanguinity
are clues for certain types of inherited liver disorders.
Phenotypic diagnosis
The traditional phenotypic diagnosis includes low GGT
as a signature of PFIC1 (FIC1 defect) and PFIC2 (BSEP
defect). GGT levels, Byler’s bile in electron microscopy,
and duodenal biliary bile content can be used as clinical
markers to indicate further genetic confirmation [84, 85].
Syndromic cholestasis, including Alagille syndrome, can
be diagnosed by phenotypic criteria [75]. Patients with
NICCD have phenotypic features, and we have developed
a clinical scoring system to aid in diagnosis [79, 86]. Im￾portantly, investigating the involvement of extrahepatic
organs is important for differential diagnosis.
Biochemical diagnosis
For patients suspecting jaundice or cholestasis, routine
liver biochemistry tests include total and direct bilirubin
levels, aspartate transferase levels, ALT levels, GGT and
alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels. Low serum GGT level
disproportionate to severity of cholestasis is a clinical
clue for inherited cholestasis such as PFIC and inborn er￾rors of bile acid synthesis. Some disorders with metabolic
signatures can be diagnosed with biochemical analysis. Dis￾eases, such as inborn error of bile acid metabolism
(IEBAM), [87] and metabolic disorders, such as NICCD,
[86] require analysis by mass spectrometry.
Genetic diagnosis
Genetic diagnosis is a definitive diagnosis for inherited
genetic liver diseases, as many of these diseases lack ad￾equate biomarkers. Genetic tests have largely evolved in
the past two decades due to the tremendous progress of
genetic analysis technologies. Conventional genetic diag￾nosis uses direct sequencing for selected genes based on
the phenotype of the patient. High-throughput methods
have subsequently been developed, such as a resequencing
chip that detects 5 genes for genetic cholestasis (SER￾PINA1, JAG1, ATP8B1, ABCB11, and ABCB4) in 2007
[88]. Denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography
and high-resolution melting analysis have been used to
detect single-gene variants in large numbers of patients
[46, 79]. Recent next generation sequencing (NGS)
panels in liver diseases have incorporated a limited
number of genes, particularly PFIC [65, 89]. Expanded
panel-based NGS involving more than 50 genes has
been used in clinical patients with promising results
[55, 90]. Whole exome sequencing has been applied to
identify novel disease-causing genes [57, 63].
Treatment
Nutritional support
Bile mediates the intestinal absorption of fat and fat￾soluble vitamins. In cholestatic liver diseases, the defective
absorption of fat and fat-soluble vitamins (vitamins A, D,
E, and K) is commonly observed but clinically obscure.
Fat malabsorption results in calorie insufficiency and
failure to thrive, especially in early childhood. Patients are
advised to use formulas containing medium-chain triglyc￾erides or add oils containing medium-chain triglycerides
to their food. Deficiency in fat-soluble vitamins may result
in multiple organ dysfunctions, including rickets, coagu￾lopathy, and defective neurological, immunological and
visual functions. Without supplementation, symptoms of
deficiency, such as coagulopathy, osteoporosis, fracture,
growth failure and life-threatening hemorrhage, may
occur in patients. In addition, deficiencies in fat-soluble vi￾tamins may also cause inadequate anti-oxidation, which is
frequently overlooked in clinical patients.
Medical treatment
Although jaundice is the common manifestation of the
highly variable etiologies, treatment does not target only
to jaundice improvement (to reduce serum bilirubin
level), but to target the underlying disorders that may
cause hepatobiliary injury and progressive fibrosis and
cirrhosis, which is usually associated with elevated bile
acid levels or abnormal metabolites. Additional treat￾ment goals are to improve nutritional status, pruritus
and life quality, to prevent or to treat cirrhosis related
complications.
PFICs, Alagille syndrome, and inborn errors of bile
acid synthesis are the most devastating disorders that
cause cirrhosis and may need liver transplantation. Ef￾fective treatment options for PFICs and Alagille syn￾drome are limited. Several drugs are under investigation
and clinical trial. Here we will discuss about the stand￾ard treatment and several newly developed therapeutic
strategies for these disorders.
Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) has widely been used to
treat cholestatic liver disease and is effective to improve
biochemical parameters and pruritus [91]. However,
UDCA is not an ideal therapeutic option for PFIC2 pa￾tients with BSEP defects. In animal models, UDCA may
Chen et al. Journal of Biomedical Science (2018) 25:75 Page 8 of 13

aggravate liver injury due to the inability of BSEP to ex￾port UDCA from hepatocytes [92]. There is a need to
develop new drugs targeting BSEP defects. Missense mu￾tations in BSEP/ABCB11 impair protein translation or
intracellular trafficking, which reduce canalicular expres￾sion of BSEP and eventually cause cholestasis. Recent
studies have indicated that 4-phenylbutyrate (4-PB,
Buphenyl), a clinically approved pharmacological
chaperone, can be used to restore the canalicular expres￾sion of BSEP. By using MDCK II cells and SD rats,
Hayashi et al. reported that 4-PB significantly relocalizes
and enhances the cell surface expression of both
wild-type and mutated rat Bsep [93]. Besides its effect
on Bsep expression, 4-PB treatment significantly in￾creased hepatic MRP2 and decreased serum bilirubin
level in patient with ornithine transcarbamylase defi￾ciency (OTCD) [94]. Moreover, Gonzales et al. applied
4-PBA to PFIC2 patients and successfully restored the
hepatic secretion of bile acids and decreased total serum
bilirubin via the re-localization of mutated BSEP to can￾alicular membranes [95]. In addition to 4-PB, steroids
are a therapeutic option to enhance BSEP expression.
Cell culture experiments have suggested that dexa￾methasone upregulates Bsep and Mrp2 at the mRNA
level in rat primary hepatocytes [96, 97], and treatment
with glucocorticoids induces the expression of Bsep,
Mrp2, and cytochrome P450 oxidase in rat livers [98].
Additional animal experiments and clinical tests have
shown that steroid treatment improved bile homeostasis.
For example, dogs receiving a high dosage of hydrocorti￾sone (5 mg/kg) showed a significant increase in bile flow
[99]. Engelmann et al. reported that steroids effectively
ameliorated cholestatic itches and reduced the serum
level of bile salts and bilirubin in two PFIC2 patients
carrying missense mutations in BSEP [100].
Blocking enterohepatic circulation has been recently
shown as a promising strategy to reduce the hepatic ac￾cumulation of bile acids in PFIC2 patients. After secre￾tion from the gallbladder into the intestine, a majority of
bile acid is absorbed by enterocytes via ASBT and
recycled to liver via enterohepatic circulation. Two inde￾pendent animal studies have shown that small molecule
ASBT inhibitors, SC-425 and A4250, effectively reduced
the enteric uptake of bile acid, decreased serum total
bilirubin levels, and improved liver fibrosis and inflam￾mation in Mdr2 knockout mice, an animal model of
PFIC3 [101]. Moreover, on March 2018, A4250 success￾fully passed clinical phase II trials (ClinicalTrials.gov
Identifier: NCT02630875).
The recently developed FXR agonist (Obeticholic acid)
has been demonstrated to improve the ALP level in pri￾mary biliary cirrhosis [102], and has also been investi￾gated for the treatment of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis
(NASH) [103–105].
Certain types of the inborn errors of bile acid metab￾olism are treatable [81]. Oral cholic acid therapy is indi￾cated for 3β-Hydroxy-Δ(5)-C27-steroid oxidoreductase
(HSD3B7) deficiency, Δ (4)-3-oxosteroid 5β-reductase
(SRD5B1, AKR1D1) deficiency, and Zellweger spectrum
disorders [106]. CDCA has also been reported to be ef￾fective for oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7B1) defi￾ciency, cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis, and other
forms of bile acid synthetic defects [107]. After treat￾ment, patients may recover from liver dysfunction, free
of jaundice, and avoid liver transplantation. Life-long
therapy is indicated for the oral supplementation. Early
diagnosis and treatment is important to improve
outcome.
Many patients with cholestatic liver disease suffer from
pruritus, except patients with inborn errors of bile acid
synthesis. Alagille syndrome, PFIC1 and 2 commonly
cause disturbing pruritus, which affects daily life quality.
Antihistamines, rifampin, and cholestyramine have been
used to partially improve the symptoms of this condi￾tion. UV-B phototherapy is an alternative therapy to
treat pruritus.
Biliary diversion and nasogastric drainage
Palliative treatment with biliary diversion surgery by the
disruption of enterohepatic circulation may relieve prur￾itus and improve liver biochemical profiles. Several strat￾egies have been used, including external biliary diversion
or ileal exclusion [108–110].
Liver transplantation
Liver transplantation is considered a curative treat￾ment for various liver diseases [111]. However, for
PFIC2 patients, the recurrence of the BSEP defect has
been reported due to circulating BSEP antibodies [112,
113]. Anti-CD20 antibody and plasmapheresis have
been reported to treat recurrent BSEP deficiency [114].
The outcomes in BSEP defects of common European
mutations, such as D482G, are better than those of
other mutation types [85]. In addition, patients with
multi-organ manifestations, such as diarrhea and pan￾creatic insufficiency in PFIC1, cannot be treated by
liver transplantation.
Liver tumor surveillance
The disruption of bile acid transport not only causes
PFIC but has also been associated with hepatocellular
carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma [115, 116]. Patients
with BSEP deficiency and tyrosinemia are of greater risk
of developing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). It is
mandatory that patients with PFIC be screened for liver
tumors on a regular basis. Alpha-fetoprotein is not typ￾ically elevated. Some patients were found to have HCC
in the explanted liver. Thirty-eight out of 175 pediatric
Chen et al. Journal of Biomedical Science (2018) 25:75 Page 9 of 13

HCC patients receiving liver transplantation were diag￾nosed with inherited liver diseases [117].
Hepatocyte transplantation and gene therapy
Liver transplantation is often an ultimate option for pa￾tients with severe cholestasis, but the rarity of organ
sources is an important issue. Hepatocyte transplant￾ation might be an alternative therapy to use efficiently
donor tissue in a less invasive manner. Cell therapy has
been investigated in animal models with various extents
of hepatocyte repopulation, including models of PFIC3
(Mdr2 knockout mice), PFIC2 (Abcb11 knockout mice)
and hereditary tyrosinemia [118–120]. In previous stud￾ies, we found that UDCA can provide a selective growth
advantage to donor hepatocytes in Abcb11 knockout
mice and enhance the repopulation of donor hepatocytes
and partially correct the bile acid profile [92]. However,
insufficient long-term substitution ratio of donor hep￾atocyte in the livers of recipients, and the lack of donor
cell sources limits the wide application of UDCA to treat
clinical patients. For the past two decades, more than 20
patients with inherited liver-based metabolic disorders
have received hepatocyte transplantation. Most of these
patients showed only partial and transient improvements
in metabolic function for several months and finally
underwent liver transplantation [121–123]. Among these
individuals, two patients with PFIC2 showed no obvious
benefits after hepatocyte transplantation, as the existing
fibrosis impaired the engraftment of the transplanted he￾patocytes [122]. Recently, glyceryl trinitrate have been
shown to enhance the efficacy of the transplanted hep￾atocyte repopulation in Mdr2 knockout mice [124].
With additional treatment to boost donor cell repopula￾tion, hepatocyte transplantation might be refined and
benefit patients with cholestasis.
Few studies on experimental gene therapy for chole￾static liver diseases have been reported. The adenoviral
transfer of the aquaporin-1 gene has been shown to im￾prove bile flow in rats with estrogen-induced cholestasis,
but the effect in inherited cholestatic disease has not
been validated [125].
Conclusions
With the revolutionary development of genetic analysis
technologies, we have largely elucidated the molecular
mechanisms of jaundice, bile flow and bile metabolism
and identified new causes of genetic liver diseases that
cause cholestasis. The understanding of “bile biology”
not only provides insights into the mechanisms of liver
pathophysiology but also facilitates the diagnosis of
genetic liver diseases and the development of novel
treatments.
