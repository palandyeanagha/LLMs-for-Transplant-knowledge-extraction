Abstract
Introduction: The pathogenesis of heart failure (HF) in diabetic individuals, called “diabetic cardiomyopathy”, is only
partially understood. Alterations in the cardiac autonomic nervous system due to oxidative stress have been implicated.
The intrinsic cardiac nervous system (ICNS) is an important regulatory pathway of cardiac autonomic function, however,
little is known about the alterations that occur in the ICNS in diabetes. We sought to characterize morphologic changes
and the role of oxidative stress within the ICNS of diabetic hearts. Cultured ICNS neuronal cells from the hearts of
3- and 6-month old type 1 diabetic streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic Sprague-Dawley rats and age-matched
controls were examined. Confocal microscopy analysis for protein gene product 9.5 (PGP 9.5) and amino acid adducts
of (E)-4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (4-HNE) using immunofluorescence was undertaken. Cell morphology was then analyzed in
a blinded fashion for features of neuronal dystrophy and the presence of 4-HNE adducts.
Results: At 3-months, diabetic ICNS neuronal cells exhibited 30% more neurite swellings per area (p = 0.01), and had a
higher proportion with dystrophic appearance (88.1% vs. 50.5%; p = <0.0001), as compared to control neurons. At
6-months, diabetic ICNS neurons exhibited more features of dystrophy as compared to controls (74.3% vs. 62.2%;
p = 0.0448), with 50% more neurite branching (p = 0.0015) and 50% less neurite outgrowth (p = <0.001). Analysis of
4-HNE adducts in ICNS neurons of 6-month diabetic rats demonstrated twice the amount of reactive oxygen species
(ROS) as compared to controls (p = <0.001).
Conclusion: Neuronal dystrophy occurs in the ICNS neurons of STZ-induced diabetic rats, and accumulates temporally
within the disease process. In addition, findings implicate an increase in ROS within the neuronal processes of ICNS
neurons of diabetic rats suggesting an association between oxidative stress and the development of dystrophy in
cardiac autonomic neurons.
Introduction
The prevalence of diabetes mellitus is increasing at an
alarming rate and parallel trends of the incidence of heart
failure (HF) [1,2]. It is estimated that the global number of
people living with diabetes will reach 380 million by 2025
[3-6]. While the relationship between heart failure and
diabetes can be partially explained by the concomitant risk
factors associated with diabetes, evidence now supports dia￾betes as an independent risk factor for HF [4-9]. HF associ￾ated with diabetes mellitus, or “diabetic cardiomyopathy”
has been defined to occur in the absence of both obstructive
coronary artery disease (CAD) and hypertension [4,7,8,10].
The correlation between diabetic cardiomyopathy (DC)
and the development of HF is profound. The Framingham
Study found the risk of developing HF to be two times
higher in diabetic males, and five times higher in diabetic
females, independent of hypertension, age, CAD, obesity
and hyperlipidemia [2,5,6]. Additionally, diabetes has been
used as a prognostic indicator in HF patients [11,12], with
the five-year mortality rate in patients with diabetic auto￾nomic neuropathy having been reported to be as high as
53%, versus 15% with normal autonomic function [13-16].
The underlying pathogenesis of DC is only partially under￾stood, but evidence suggests a link between autonomic

dysfunction and abnormal myocardial function (heart rate
and myocardial blood flow [10]) in diabetes mellitus.
Diabetic autonomic neuropathy is a significant clinical
complication of diabetes that carries substantial patient
mortality and morbidity [13,14,17,18]. The parasympa￾thetic and sympathetic nervous systems have been trad￾itionally thought to operate in a simple relay fashion to
control heart rate, but data now demonstrates that the
mammalian heart possesses a complex nervous system, the
intrinsic cardiac nervous system (ICNS), which can func￾tion independently to regulate the heart [19-21]. In vivo
analysis of animal and human models have shown that
intracardiac neuronal ganglia of the ICNS regulate cardiac
output on a real-time, beat-to-beat basis, independent of
extracardiac inputs (i.e. from the paravertebral ganglia)
[19,20,22-24]. As such, the ICNS behaves as a potent neur￾onal modulator of cardiac function, and has been called
the “little brain on the heart” [21,25]. The ICNS contains
afferent neurons [26,27], sympathetic efferent postgangli￾onic neurons [28-30], parasympathetic efferent postgangli￾onic neurons [31], and a large population of local circuitry
neurons that perform interconnections within the intrinsic
cardiac ganglionated plexuses [28,32]. The characterization
of the neurons within the ICNS has been performed on
both large [26,29,33-35] and small [36-39] animals, as well
as the human heart [40-42]. Importantly, the human ICNS
behaves in a very similar fashion to that observed in animal
models [24,43]. Given its importance, alteration of ICNS
function is thought to play a central role in the pathophysi￾ology of heart failure and arrhythmias [15,44,45].
Dystrophic changes in axonal and dendritic morphology,
such as neurite swellings, aberrant neurite branching, and
decreased neurite outgrowth, in the absence of significant
neuronal loss, are the neuropathological hallmarks of dia￾betic neuropathy [18,46-48]. The underlying process in￾volved in the development of dystrophic and dysfunctional
neurons has yet to be established, however it has been
proposed that high serum glucose concentrations results in
neurotoxicity with the eventual alteration or loss of nerve
fibers [49,50]. One possible culprit for the proposed neuro￾toxicity is an increased level of reactive oxygen species
(ROS). Cultured adult rat dorsal root ganglion neurons
(DRG) exposed to high physiological concentrations of glu￾cose, results in an increased production of ROS, specifically
within the neuronal axons, manifesting in axonal swelling
and degeneration, but not in cell death [51]. Further
evidence for ROS-mediated neurotoxicity was recently
described by Campanucci and colleagues, who found
that hyperglycemia induced a ROS-mediated depression
of acetylcholine-evoked currents in the autonomic neu￾rons of mice, thereby leading to a depression in synaptic
transmission [52].
Previous reports of diabetic neuropathy have largely fo￾cused on extracardiac autonomic neurons. Examination of
exposure of the isolated ICNS neurons to high glucose con￾centration has not been previously examined. We therefore
sought to characterize the morphology of cultured ICNS in
a diabetic rodent model. Secondly, we sought to examine
the role of oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of neuronal
dystrophy in the ICNS of a diabetic heart.
Materials and methods
Statement of ethics
The investigation conforms to the Guide for the Care and
Use of Laboratory Animals published by the US National
Institutes of Health (NIH Publication No. 85-23, revised
1996). All animal experiment protocols were approved by
the University of Manitoba Animal Care Committee fol￾lowing the guidelines established by the Canadian Council
on Animal Care.
Primary cell culture
Primary ICNS cells were isolated from the hearts of
3-month (n = 5) and 6-month (n = 6) streptozotocin
(STZ)-diabetic adult Sprague-Dawley male rats or age￾matched control (n = 4 and n = 6, respectively). Rats were
made type 1 diabetic with a single intraperitoneal injection
of 75 mg/kg STZ (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louise, MO). Body
weight, plasma glucose and HbA1c was collected and used
as endpoints for the development of diabetes (Table 1).
Rats were deeply anesthetized with 5% isofluorane and eu￾thanized by cervical decapitation. Hearts were rapidly re￾moved and placed in cold 1xPBS. The atria was separated
from the ventricles, the great vessels, and the atrial ap￾pendages, isolating the ICNS ganglionated plexus located
within the dorsal fat of the central portion of the atria,
near the pulmonary veins [38,53,54]. The isolated tissue
was transferred to a dish containing cold filtered 1xPBS
and then cut into small pieces. The tissue was then placed
through two digestions; the first, consisting of 0.5% (w/v)
collagenase (Worthington Biochemical, Lakewood, NJ) in
2 mL of warm F12 medium, and the second consisting of
0.25% (w/v) trypsin (Worthington) in 2 mL warm F12

medium. Both 1hr digestions were completed in a shaking
incubator at 200 rpm and 37°C, with a wash of warm F12
performed in between. Following the second digestion,
1ml of fetal bovine serum (FBS) was added to deactivate
the trypsin. 2 ml of F12 medium was added to the cell sus￾pension and titrated using a smoothened Pasteur pipette.
The supernatant was decanted into a sterile tube and this
procedure was repeated, and the collected cell suspension
was passed through a 70 μm cell filter into a sterile 50 ml
falcon tube. The filtered cell suspension was then trans￾ferred to a sterile 15 ml falcon tube and centrifuged at
99.68 × g at room temperature (RT) for 5 minutes. The
pellet was then re-suspended in 1 ml of F12 media, and
added to a 1 ml solution of 15% BSA (O.5 ml F12 and
0.5 ml 30% BSA - Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louise, MO), which
was then centrifuged at 99.68 × g for 10 minutes. The pel￾let was re-suspended in 1ml of growth medium (diabetic
or control), and 150 μl of the cell suspension was added to
the pre-treated cover slips in the 6-well cell culture plates.
The plates were then placed in an incubator for 1 hour at
37°C and 5% CO2, after which point 1.5 ml of the appro￾priate growth medium was added to the wells, and the
plates were returned to the incubator. Cells were visual￾ized after 48 and 72 hours of growth using a phase
contrast microscope (Nikon Eclipse TS100).
Preparation of cover slips
One day prior to cell isolation, sterile 22 mm coverslips
(VWR, Mississauga, ON) were placed in 6-well culture
plates and washed 3X with 2 ml of 1xPBS. The cover￾slips were coated in 1.5 ml of 0.5 mg/ml poly-DL￾polyornithine (PORN) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louise, MO)
and placed in a 37°C incubator overnight. On the morn￾ing of the isolation, the PORN was removed and the
coverslips were washed with Ham’s F-12 nutrient mix￾ture medium (F12 - Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The cov￾erslips were then coated with 1.5 ml of 1 μg/ml laminin
(Nunclon Surface, Ottawa, ON, Canada) in F12 medium
for 3 hours at a 37°C. The laminin was then removed
and the cover slips washed 3X with F12 medium just
prior to the addition of the cells.
Preparation of growth medium
The growth medium used for neuronal culture consisted
of Ham’s F12 medium, plus several additives. The neuro￾trophic factors were 0.3ng/ml of nerve growth factor
beta (NGF-ß - Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louise, MO), 1 ng/ml of
neurotrophin-3 (NT-3 - Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louise, MO),
and 5 ng/ml of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor
(GDNF - Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louise, MO). The stock N2
additive was prepared in F12 medium without antibiotic or
insulin, and was composed of progesterone (Sigma-Aldrich,
St. Louise, MO), putrescine (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louise,
MO), sodium selenite (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louise, MO),
fatty-acid free BSA powder (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louise,
MO), and transferrin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louise, MO).
40 μl of stock N2 was added per 4 ml of growth
medium, bringing the final concentrations to 20 nM of
progesterone, 100 μM of putrescine, 30 nM of sodium
selinite, 0.1 mg/ml of BSA and 100 μg/ml of transferrin.
To this standard growth medium (containing 10mM
glucose), 0.1 nM of insulin was added, while a final con￾centration of 25 mM of glucose and zero insulin was
used in the diabetic growth medium. It has been dem￾onstrated that adult neurons do not undergo apoptosis
under this high glucose preparation [52].
Immunocytochemistry
After 72 hours in culture, the neurons were fixed with 4%
paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffer at pH 7.4 for 15
min, followed by permeation with 0.3% Triton X-100 in
PBS. Nonspecific binding was blocked by incubation with
Blocking Reagent (Roche, Indianapolis, IN) combined with
FBS and 1.0 M PBS in proportions of 3:1:1 for 1 hr at
room temperature, followed by three washes with PBS.
The coverslips were incubated in polyclonal antibody to
amino acid adducts of (E)-4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (1:500
anti-4-HNE adducts Pab; Alexis Biochemicals, San Diego,
CA) overnight at 4ºC in a humidified chamber. The next
day, coverslips were washed several times in 1XPBS,
followed by incubation in Alexa Flour 488 (Molecular
Probes, Burlington, ON; 1:700) secondary antibody for 3 hr
at room temperature. The coverslips were washed again in
1XPBS, and incubated with polyclonal anti-protein gene
product (PGP) 9.5 (1:500 – UltraClone Limited, Isle of
Wight, England) overnight at 4°C in a humidified chamber
in the dark. The coverslips were then washed in 1XPBS,
and then incubated for three hours with Alexa Fluor 546
(1:700). Coverslips were mounted to microscope slides
using mounting medium with DAPI, Hard Set (Vector,
Cat#H-1500). A Carl Zeiss LSM510 inverted confocal
microscope was utilized for identification of neurons
throughout specimens. Confocal images were captured
using a Plan-Neofluar 40x/1.3 Oil DIC objective at 10 μm
intervals ascending from the substrate though neuronal
cell bodies and processes (Z sections). The images were
reconstructed in three dimensions using Zeiss LSM Image
Browser software (Germany).
Morphometric analysis
The confocal images captured were analyzed in a
blinded fashion to animal group. Two different methods
of analysis were undertaken to determine the morph￾ology of the neurons in culture. Firstly, dystrophic
features quantified by assessment of the area of neurite
outgrowth, and the number of neurite branches and
swellings via ImageJ 1.42 software (http://rsbweb.nih.
gov/ij/) on masked images [51,55]. In brief, fluorescence

images of PGP-9.5 and 4-HNE co-stained immunoreac￾tive neurons were separated from their surroundings
by a threshold value, the cell body was deleted from
the image, and measurements were made to score the
immunoreactive area within the pixel range [51,55,56].
Neurite swellings and branch points were then manually
labeled and counted for each neuron. As specific staining
was not done to differentiate axons from dendrites, all
swellings observed on neuronal extensions will be referred
to here as neurite swellings. Secondly, defined morpho￾logical features were used to categorize the neuronal cells
into three different groups, according to the degree of
dystrophy; non-dystrophic, mildly dystrophic and highly
dystrophic [56] (Figure 1). Non-dystrophic neurons had a
normal appearance, with smooth and intact processes
(Figure 1A). Mildly dystrophic neurons exhibited some
features of dystrophy, such as sharp angles in neuronal
processes, and outgrowth of lamellipodia-like structures
from cell bodies and proximal neurites (arrows, Figure 1B),
while highly dystrophic neurons demonstrated highly
irregular morphological features, such as aberrant neuritic
growth from cell bodies and the appearance of frequent
loops and curls in neuritic processes (arrows, Figure 1C)
[56]. More than 200 neurons were scored per experimen￾tal condition.
4-HNE adduct analysis
The confocal images captured were analyzed with ImageJ
1.42 software in a blinded fashion. Fluorescence images of
4-HNE adduct staining immunoreactive neurons were
separated from their surroundings by a threshold value,
the cell body was deleted from the image, and measure￾ments were made to score both the immunoreactive area
within the pixel range and the intensity of the fluores￾cence. The average intensity of fluorescence was then
divided by the average area of fluorescence.

of dystrophy, as defined by certain morphological features. Non-dystrophic neurons had a normal appearance, with smooth and intact processes
(AI-III). Mildly dystrophic neurons exhibited some features of dystrophy, such as outgrowths of lamellipodia-like structures from cell bodies and
proximal neurites (arrows, BI), and sharp angles in neuronal processes (arrows, BII and III). Highly dystrophic neurons demonstrated irregular
morphological features, such as aberrant neuritic growth from cell bodies and the appearance of frequent loops and curls in neuritic processes (arrows, CI-III).

Data analysis
All data, with the exception of the dystrophic neuronal
proportions, was subject to standard two-tailed unpaired
Student’s t-Test with significance levels of p = 0.05, which
does not assume equal variances, using GraphPad Prism
4 (GraphPad Prism 4, GraphPad Software Inc., San
Diego, CA) [51]. All results are expressed as mean ±
SEM. The data for the proportion of dystrophic neurons
was compared using a normal approximation method
(need references).
Results
Morphology of primary ICNS cultures
Phase contrast images (Figure 2) were taken of cultured
STZ-diabetic and age matched control neurons at 72 hrs
of culture. Neurons were assessed for morphology and
confluence. As previously demonstrated in rodent ICNS
cultures [57], three different neuronal types were found to
have been isolated by evaluating cell morphology, includ￾ing pseudounipolar neurons (cells with a large cell body
and single long neurite), bipolar neurons (spindle-shaped
cells with long neurites at opposite ends), and multipolar
neurons (exhibiting several neurites of various lengths)
(Figure 2).
Effect of diabetes on neurite outgrowth
Cultures of 3- and 6-month diabetic rat neurons co-stained
with PGP-9.5 and 4-HNE (Figure 3) were examined for
neurite outgrowth, neurite swellings and neurite branching.
At 3-months, STZ-diabetic rat culture ICNS neurons dem￾onstrated a 20% increase in the area of neurite outgrowth
(Figure 4A; p = 0.0042), and 30% more neurite swellings per
area (Figure 4B; p = 0.01) as compared to controls. How￾ever, neurite branching was not significantly different be￾tween culture groups (Figure 4C). At 6 months, cultured
STZ-diabetic rat neurons demonstrated a decrease in the
area of neurite outgrowth (Figure 4D), at only 50% of the
control neurons (p = <0.001). The difference in the number
of neurite swellings was not found to be statistically signifi￾cant (Figure 4E), however cultured diabetic rat ICNS
neurons exhibited a significant increase in neurite branch￾ing as compared to controls (Figure 4F), with 50% more
branch points per area (p = 0.0015). Furthermore, at 3-
months, cultured STZ-diabetic rat ICNS neurons demon￾strated a greater proportion of any dystrophic features
compared to control ICNS neurons, with higher propor￾tions of both mildly dystrophic (34.9% vs. 21.1%, p =
0.0244) and highly dystrophic (53.2% vs. 29.5%, p = 0.004)
neurons (Figure 5A). There was also a higher proportion
of any dystrophy (mild or high) in the diabetic neurons
as compared to controls (88.1% vs. 50.5%, p = <0.0001;
Figure 5C). At 6-months, cultured STZ-diabetic rat
ICNS neurons were also found to have higher proportions
of mildly dystrophic neurons (39.4% vs. 27.4%, p = 0.008;
Figure 5B). There was no difference in the proportion of
highly dystrophic neurons at 6 months, however, a higher
proportion of any dystrophy (mild or high) in diabetic
neurons as compared to control neurons was observed
(74.3% vs. 62.2%, p = 0.0448; Figure 5D).
Expression of 4-HNE adducts
Cultures of 3- and 6- month diabetic rat neurons were
stained for the amino acid adducts of 4-HNE as a
marker of ROS production (Figure 6). At 3 months,
diabetic and control intrinsic cardiac neurons demonstrated
no differences in the intensity of staining for 4-HNE ad￾ducts (Figure 7A). However, by 6 months, cultured intrin￾sic cardiac neurons from the diabetic heart demonstrated
a significant increase in intensity of 4-HNE adducts as
compared to that of the control neurons ((p = <0.001;
Figure 7B).
Discussion
This study demonstrated that isolated intrinsic cardiac
neurons from adult STZ-diabetic and age-matched con￾trol rats can be maintained in culture, and that ICNS
neurons show varied morphology, indicative of the cell
types that exist in vivo within the cardiac ganglia. It was
further demonstrated that neuronal dystrophy occurs in
the ICNS neurons of STZ-induced diabetic rats, and

accumulates temporally within the disease process. In
addition, an increase in 4-HNE adducts occurs in the
neuronal processes implicating an association between
oxidative stress and the development of a dystrophy in
cardiac autonomic neurons. At the time of writing this
manuscript, we are not aware of any previous study exam￾ining the effect of high-glucose on the cardiac autonomic
nervous system.
Analysis of the 3-month data indicated that only one
quantifiable dystrophic feature, the number of neurite
swellings, was significantly greater in the diabetic ICNS
neurons. Neurite swellings, thought to be the residues of
aberrant intra-ganglionic sprouting, may be axonal or
dendritic in nature, and have been described as being
large accumulations of small mitochondria and neuronal
structural proteins [18,46,47,51]. The significance of
neurite swellings in the pathogenesis of neuronal dys￾function may be two-fold. Firstly, the collection of debris
may reflect or induce alterations in axonal transport
[55,58]. Altered axonal transport may result in death of
mitochondria and the absence of structural proteins at
distal sites, and the distal axon, lacking the sufficient
tools for plasticity, is predisposed to dissolution upon
subsequent injury or stress [18,51]. Secondly, the collec￾tion of mitochondria themselves may produce a local
exaggeration of oxidative stress via the overproduction
of superoxide by the electron transport chain in the
mitochondria, leading to a self-propagating pathway of
neuritic dystrophy [18,59]. In accordance with this view,
the neurite swellings exhibited a greater level of 4-HNE
adduct expression (Figure 6).
At 6-months, an increase in the number of dystrophic
features was observed in the diabetic ICNS neurons, with
two quantifiable dystrophic features (area of neuronal out￾growth and neurite branching) being significantly different
from controls. Increased neurite branching has been

postulated as a compensatory response of a neuron to a
loss of synapses occurring along their length [60,61]. An
aberrant increase in branching morphology has also been
observed in neurons affected with Alzheimer’s disease
(AD), characterized by a pattern of ineffective intensive
growth [61]. Given the parallels that have been drawn
between the effects of AD and diabetes on neurons, it is
possible that this type of neurite branching may also be
occurring in diabetic neurons [62-64]. Furthermore, in￾creased neurite branching has been described in diabetic
rat neurons of prevertebral and paravertebral sympathetic
ganglia [48]. In diabetic neurons, the development of
axonal sprouts appears to serve as a substrate for further
dystrophic changes, with their appearance preceding the
development of axonal swellings [48,65]. At 6 months, the
decrease in area of neuronal outgrowth as compared to
controls is an expected and often observed finding in
dystrophic diabetic neurons, owing to the degeneration of
axons and nerve fiber loss [46,58,66]. The number of
neurite swellings did not differ significantly between the
6-month diabetic and control neuronal groups.
Overall, analysis of 3-month and 6-month data dem￾onstrated an increase in the dystrophic features in the
diabetic neurons between the two time points, with
two of the dystrophic features being more prominent
in the 6-month diabetics, compared to only one feature
for the 3-month diabetics. Importantly, it has been
demonstrated in other diabetic rat peripheral neurons
that the dystrophic effects of diabetes accumulate tem￾porally, with dysmorphology progressing from mild at

collected from 3-month control (n = 101) and diabetic (n = 128) rat neuronal cultures. An asterisk (*) indicates statistically significant data. Error bars
indicate the mean ± the S.E.M. At 3 months, area (neuronal outgrowth) and the number of neurite swellings were both found to be significantly
increased in diabetic neurons, at, respectively, 1.2X (p = 0.0042) and 1.3X (p = 0.01) that of control neurons. Branching was higher in diabetic neurons,
although not significantly, at 1.16X the control, p = 0.0688. Panels D, E, and F represent the data collected from 6-month control (n = 129) and diabetic
(n = 108) rat neuronal cultures. At 6 months, area was found to be significantly lower in the diabetic neurons, as compared to the control neurons, at
0.48X (p = <0.001). While there was no significant difference between diabetic or control neurons in the amount of neurite swellings (p = 0.3438), the
diabetic neurons were seen to have a significantly higher amount of neurite branching, at 1.56X (p = 0.0015) that of the control neurons.

early time points to more pronounced at later time
points [66]. Given the temporal relationship between
our two experimental groups, our data is in agreement
with these findings.
Due to the observed tortuosity in the neuronal pro￾cesses, we performed a confirmatory analysis of dystrophic
phenotype for the ICNS neurons. The classification of
neurons into dystrophic or non-dystrophic categories was
undertaken so as to compare neurons as a whole [56]. Im￾portantly, at both time points, there was a significantly
higher proportion of any dystrophy (mild or high) in the
diabetic neurons. That the 6-month diabetic group did
not exhibit a significantly greater proportion of highly dys￾trophic neurons was not an expected result, but a possible
explanation is that age itself produces similar dystrophic
changes in neuronal morphology [67].
Several studies have confirmed staining for the pres￾ence of 4-HNE adducts as a marker for oxidative stress
[51,52,55,68,69]. 4-HNE adducts are produced via oxi￾dative stress dependent-lipid peroxidation [52], and it
has been proposed that oxidative stress plays an import￾ant role in the formation of diabetes-associated dys￾trophic neuronal features [55,68]. Given the significant
increase in the intensity of staining for 4-HNE adducts
in the 6-month diabetic neurons, our study provides
evidence to support this hypothesis. As the 3-month
diabetic neurons did not show a difference in staining
intensity compared to the control group, this speaks to
the aforementioned increase in dystrophy that is seen to
occur temporally in diabetes [66]. As stated previously,
another important finding in our study was the increased
intensity of staining for 4-HNE adducts that was observed
inside the neurite swellings (Figure 6), which supports the
notion that oxidative stress is associated with the forma￾tion of dystrophic features in diabetic neurons [55,59].
This data adds to the growing body of evidence support￾ing the physiologic importance of ICNS in the diabetic
heart. A recent study by Mabe and Hoover [70] illustrated
that a functional parasympathetic nervous system cannot
negate the deleterious effects of a dysfunctional ICNS.
Using a STZ-mouse model, they demonstrated a reduction
in resting heart rate, as well as alterations with high and
low frequency power (via spectral analysis of electrocar￾diograms), in diabetic mice, suggesting a relative reduction
of parasympathetic tone. Further confirmation via immu￾nohistochemical analysis demonstrated no loss of cardiac
Figure 5 Morphological assessment of neuronal dystrophy. Panels A and C represent data collected from the 3-month neuronal cultures. As
panel A indicates, at 3 months, there were significantly higher proportions of mildly (34.9% vs. 21.1%, p = 0.0244) and highly dystrophy (53.2% vs.
29.5%, p = 0.0004) neurons in the diabetic neurons vs. the control neurons. Panel C indicates there was a significantly higher proportion of any
dystrophy (mild or high) in the diabetic vs. the control neurons (88.1% vs. 50.5%, p = <0.0001). Panels B and D represent data collected from
6-month neuronal cultures. At 6 months, there was a significantly higher proportion of mild dystrophy in diabetic neurons vs. control (39.4% vs.
27.4%, p = 0.008), but no statistical significance to the proportions of neurons that were highly dystrophic. Additionally, as seen in Panel D, there
was a significantly higher proportion of any dystrophy (mild or high) in the diabetic neurons vs. the controls (74.3% vs. 62.2%, p = 0.0448). Error
bars indicate the mean ± the S.E.M.

cultures. Panels C (aged-matched control) and D (STZ-diabetic) are images of 6-month neuronal cultures. Neurons were stained and imaged using
immunofluorescence for 4-HNE adducts. Images were captured on a Carl Zeiss LSM510 inverted confocal microscope with a 40x objective. The software
program ImageJ 1.42 (available at http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/) was used to quantify both the intensity of fluorescence, and the total neurite area staining
positive for 4-HNE adducts. Note in panel D the increased intensity of fluorescence expressed in the neurite swellings (white arrows).

adduct staining vs. the total 4-HNE staining neurite area for both 3- and 6-month STZ-diabetic and age-matched control rat neuronal cultures. An
asterisk (*) indicates statistically significant data. Error bars indicate the mean ± the S.E.M. At 3 months (panel A), there was no statistical significance in
4-HNE adduct staining between diabetic and control neurons (p = 0.5755). At 6 months (Panel B), there was a significant difference observed, with the
diabetic neurons displaying a 4-HNE adduct staining intensity per total 4-HNE staining area that was 2.22X that seen in the controls (p = <0.0001).

cholinergic neurons or nerve fibers, nor altered cholin￾ergic sensitivity of the atria. The authors thus concluded
that the observed heart rate abnormalities in the dia￾betic mice may be as a result of defective ganglionic
neurotransmission. The dysmorphic alterations observed
in our analysis of diabetic ICNS neurons supports their
proposition that the true neuronal dysfunction lies within
the intracardiac ganglia.
We acknowledge that a limitation of our analysis is the
lack of in vivo functional correlation to the morphologic
changes observed in the in vitro data presented. This may
have best been achieved with the use of some in vivo
assessment, such as echocardiography or other real-time
imaging modality. While we unfortunately did not have
access to this technology at the time of the study, other
investigators have demonstrated a correlation with STZ￾induced DM in rodents and left ventricular systolic and
diastolic dysfunction, fibrosis and abnormal SERCA2a ac￾tivity [71,72]. In addition, previous work examining the al￾terations of the intrinsic cardiac nervous system in disease
states, in both animal [73-76] and human models [24],
have demonstrated functional remodeling of ICNS neuro￾transmission to have profound effects on cardiodynamics.
A second limitation of our study is the inability to draw
causality between the increase in 4-HNE staining and
ROS-induced toxicity. To further elucidate the role of
ROS in neuronal dysmorphology and dysfunction, experi￾mentation with anti-oxidants, as well as electrophysiology
studies should be undertaken. Additional work will also be
necessary to further characterize the observed neurite
swellings as axonal or dendritic, and to confirm the con￾tents of the neurite swellings. Furthermore, our study did
not address the role of this ROS-induced toxicity on neur￾onal cell viability. Future studies investigating cell viability
and apoptosis would be helpful to determine whether
neuronal dysfunction is also the result of neuronal cell loss
in the intracardiac ganglia.
Conclusion
Our study demonstrated for the first time in ICNS neurons
of STZ-diabetic rats that dystrophic features accumulate
temporally in diabetic neurons, and that features associated
with neuronal oxidative stress are observed concurrently
with the development of dystrophy. This study also chal￾lenged the notion that the measurement of total area of
neuronal outgrowth is a sufficient measure of neuronal
outgrowth. Given the observed tortuosity of neuronal pro￾cesses, additional methods for neurite outgrowth assess￾ments, such as the length of the longest axon, might be
more informative. While this data provides the inference of
ROS as a mechanism of morphologic changes that occur
in the ICNS when exposed to high-glucose concentrations,
research is required to confirm that oxidative stress plays a
causative role in dystrophic changes, and to evaluate
whether the dystrophic changes observed in diabetic rat
ICNS neurons leads to neuronal dysfunction.
