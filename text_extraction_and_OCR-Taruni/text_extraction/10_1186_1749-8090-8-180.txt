Abstract
Background: Surgery for pulmonary aspergillosis is infrequent and often challenging. Risk assessment is imprecise and
new antifungals may ameliorate some surgical risks. We evaluated the medical and surgical management of these
patients, including perioperative and postoperative antifungal therapy.
Methods: Retrospective study of patients who underwent surgery for pulmonary aspergillosis between September 1996
and September 2011.
Results: 30 patients underwent surgery with 23 having a preoperative tissue diagnosis while 7 were confirmed
post-resection. The median age was 57 years (17–78). The commonest presenting symptoms were cough (40%, n = 12)
and haemoptysis (43%, n = 13). Twelve (40%) patients had simple aspergilloma (including 2 with Aspergillus nodules) while
the remaining 18 (60%) had chronic cavitary pulmonary aspergillosis (CCPA) (complex aspergilloma). Most of the patients
had underlying lung disease: tuberculosis (20%, n = 6), asthma (26%, n = 8) and COPD (20%, n = 6). The procedures
included lobectomy 50% (n = 15), pneumonectomy 10% (n = 3), sublobar resection 27% (n = 8), decortication 7% (n = 2),
segmentectomy 3% (n = 1), thoracoplasty 3% (n = 1), bullectomy and pleurectomy 3% (n = 1), 6% (n = 2) lung
transplantation for associated disease. Median hospital stay was 9.5 days (3–37). There was no operative and 30 day
mortality. Main complications were prolonged air leak (n = 7, 23%), empyema (n = 6, 20%), respiratory failure requiring
tracheostomy /reintubation (n = 4, 13%). Recurrence of CCPA was noted in 8 patients (26%), most having prior CCPA
(75%). Taurolidine 2% was active against all 9 A. fumigatus isolates and used for pleural decontamination during surgery.
Conclusions: Surgery in patients with chronic pulmonary aspergillosis offered good outcomes with an acceptable
morbidity in a difficult clinical situation; recurrence is problematic.

Background
Aspergillosis refers to a spectrum of disease caused by As￾pergillus species. This spectrum includes patients with
asthma or cystic fibrosis who have allergic broncho￾pulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) which is thought to affect
over 4 million people worldwide [1]. In immunocom￾promised and critically ill patients invasive pulmonary
aspergillosis (IPA) is relatively common and often fatal,
and estimated to affect over 200,000 people worldwide [2].
In non-immunocompromised patients chronic pulmonary
aspergillosis (CPA) (including those with an aspergilloma)
may occur in those who have suffered a pulmonary insult
such as tuberculosis, sarcoidosis, pneumothorax etc. [3].
The older term chronic necrotizing pulmonary aspergil￾losis mostly refers to those with subacute IPA. Within the
spectrum of CPA are simple aspergilloma, chronic cavitary
pulmonary aspergillosis, chronic fibrosing pulmonary as￾pergillosis and Aspergillus nodule [3,4] (Table 1) (Figure 1).

There are estimated to be about 1.2 million cases of CPA
following TB [5], perhaps 33-50% of the global total of pa￾tients with CPA.
Controversy remains regarding the surgical manage￾ment of both IPA and CPA in view of potential high
mortality and morbidity. Surgery has been reserved for
patients with unilateral, localized disease in IPA where
curative resection is possible, as well as in patients with
infection abutting the main pulmonary vessels to avoid
fatal haemoptysis [6,7].
Surgical treatment is the mainstay of management for
patients with simple aspergilloma [8]. Surgical results
are excellent [8-10]. However there are many patients
with extensive multicavity CPA who fail medical therapy
and in whom surgery is contemplated. The results of
surgical treatment for this group are not so good [11].
The perioperative management of post-surgical patients
with pulmonary aspergillosis can be challenging.
Another dilemma is the duration of postoperative anti￾fungal therapy in patients with an incidental diagnosis of
aspergillosis. In 2011, we described a group of patients
with PET positive lesions that were excised and found to
contain Aspergillus-like hyphae on histology and positive
Aspergillus IgG antibodies [4]. We have called these
Aspergillus nodules; some are cavitating, others not, some
single, many multiple. Given that some of these patients
have more than one lesion and they all had risk factors
for carcinoma of the lung, biopsy or surgical resection is
inevitable. However their post-operative management
and risk of recurrence is not described.
The objectives of our study were to analyze the short
and long term outcomes of the surgical treatment for
CPA including recurrence rates, evaluate the periopera￾tive antifungal therapy, and formulate an algorithm for
the follow-up of these patients including the further
treatment of patients with an incidental diagnosis of
aspergillosis.
Methods
We examined the pre-operative findings and surgical in￾dications, surgical procedure, histological findings and
both short and long term outcomes of 30 patients who
Table 1 Definitions of chronic pulmonary aspergillosis and its subtypes
Term Definition
Chronic pulmonary
aspergillosis
Nodular or cavitary lesion or lesions in the lung, of at least 3 months
duration in a non-immunocompromised patient (or one whose
immunocompromising condition has remitted or is trivial), caused by
Aspergillus spp. as demonstrated on tissue section by staining, by
positive culture of a percutaneous biopsy or positive Aspergillus IgG
antibodies.
Aspergilloma (Fungal ball
caused by Aspergillus spp.)
An approximately spherical shadow with surrounding air, also called a
fungal ball, in a pulmonary cavity, with serological or microbiological
evidence that Aspergillus spp. is present in the material. This is a
radiological or morphological description, not a disease descriptor and is
not required for the diagnosis of chronic pulmonary aspergillosis.
Simple aspergilloma Single pulmonary cavity containing a fungal ball, with serological or
microbiological evidence implicating Aspergillus spp. in a
non-immunocompromised patient with minor or no symptoms and no
radiological progression over at least 3 months of observation.
Aspergillus nodule One or more nodules which may or may not cavitate are an unusual form
of CPA. They may mimic carcinoma of the lung or coccidioidomycosis
and can only be definitively diagnosed on histology. Tissue invasion is not
demonstrated, although necrosis is frequent.
Chronic cavitary pulmonary
aspergillosis (CCPA)
One or more pulmonary cavities possibly containing an aspergilloma, with
serological or microbiological evidence implicating Aspergillus spp. with
significant pulmonary or systemic symptoms and overt radiological
progression (new cavities, increasing pericavity infiltrates or increasing
fibrosis) over at least 3 months of observation.
Chronic fibrosing pulmonary
aspergillosis (CFPA)
Severe fibrotic destruction of at least two lobes of lung complicating
CCPA leading to a major loss of lung function. Severe fibrotic destruction
of one lobe with a cavity is simply referred to as CCPA affecting that lobe.
Usually the fibrosis is manifest as consolidation, but large cavities with
surrounding fibrosis may be seen.
Subacute invasive
aspergillosis (SAIA) or
chronic necrotising
pulmonary aspergillosis
(CNPA) (considered the
same entity)
Invasive aspergillosis, usually in mildly immunocompromised patients,
occurring over 1–3 months, with variable radiological features including
cavitation, nodules, progressive consolidation with ‘abscess formation’.
Biopsy shows hyphae in invading lung tissue and microbiological investigations
reflect those in invasive aspergillosis, notably positive Aspergillus galactomannan
antigen in blood (or respiratory fluids).

underwent surgery for pulmonary aspergillosis between
September 1996 and September 2011. The Thoracic
Surgery Department is co-located with the National Asper￾gillosis Centre (NAC) at the University Hospital of South
Manchester. About 1,700 surgical procedures are done
every year of which one fifth was major lung resections.
The NAC manages over 250 patients with chronic pulmo￾nary aspergillosis, with about 75 new referrals annually.
Patients with CPA and aspergilloma were classified into
simple and complex aspergilloma according to previous
classification by Belcher and Plummer [12,13], although
we have used contemporary terminology for complex
aspergilloma (chronic cavitary pulmonary aspergillosis
(CCPA)). In this classification the simple aspergilloma
cases had simple, isolated thin walled cysts or cavities
lined by ciliated columnar epithelium, sometimes with
overlying pleural thickening, and the surrounding lung
was normal (Table 1). CCPA cases were defined as those
with cavities developing within grossly diseased lung
tissue, usually with extensive pleural thickening and
lung contraction. Some may have had chronic fibrosing
pulmonary aspergillosis (Table 1).
Diagnosis and classification of CPA was made based
on clinical symptoms and radiological findings on CT
scans and chest radiographs. The patients had pre￾operative fibreoptic bronchoscopy with sputum culture.
CT guided percutaneous biopsy was done in cases of
indeterminate lung nodules to rule out malignancy.

Medical records of all the patients were evaluated to col￾lect patient characteristics, operation protocols, periopera￾tive mortality and morbidity, histopathological findings,
follow up information and short and long-term outcomes.
Evaluation of perioperative antifungal therapy was also
noted.
All pre-operatively diagnosed cases were discussed in the
local specialist aspergillosis multidisciplinary meeting. Indi￾cations for surgery included unilateral localised disease
where curative resection was possible, for symptom control,
to manage complications, and for diagnosis of indetermin￾ate lung nodule. Postoperatively the patients were followed
up by the physicians at the National Aspergillosis Centre,
to supervise antifungal therapy and determine duration of
therapy and possible relapse.
Microbiological method
Using previously published microtitre methodology
[14] the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of
taurolidine (Taurolin®) (molecular weight 284.36) was
obtained by successive inoculation with solution into
each microtitre well from 250 (0.5%) to 25 (0.05%) mg/L.
Nine clinical isolates of A. fumigatus were tested, 2 of
which were pan-azole resistant. Reading was a visual no
growth endpoint at 48 hours after incubation at 37°C.
Statistical analysis
IBM SPSS 20 software was used for statistical analysis.
A P value of <0.05 was considered to be significant.
Comparisons between patients were made by unpaired
Student’s t-test for continuous variables and by Fisher’s
exact test or chi square test for categorical variables.
For survival analysis, Kaplan-Meier’s survival curve was
used. Parametric variables were expressed with a median
and binary variables were expressed with frequency.
Results
Thirty patients underwent surgery with 23 (77%) having
a preoperative tissue diagnosis while 7 (23%) were con￾firmed post resection. There were an equal number of
males and females. The median age was 57 years (range
17–78). The major indications for surgery included recur￾rent haemoptysis (43%, n = 13), chronic cavitating lesions
(26%, n = 8), lung nodules (23%, n = 7) and empyema
(10%, n = 3). One patient with a simple aspergilloma had
previously declined surgery, received long term antifungal
therapy and grown pan-azole resistant A. fumigatus.
The commonest presenting symptoms amongst the 30
patients were cough (40%, n = 12) and haemoptysis (43%,
n = 13) (Table 2). Among the 30 patients 12 (40%) had
simple aspergilloma (Group 1) while the remaining 18
(60%) patients (Group 2) had CCPA. Most of the patients
had underlying lung disease. Underlying lung diseases in￾cluded tuberculosis (20%, n = 6), asthma (26%, n = 8),
COPD (20%, n = 6), bronchiectasis (10%, n = 3), sarcoid￾osis (3%, n = 1) and cystic fibrosis (3%, n = 1). Six patients
(20%) were immunosuppressed. Three patients had post￾operative immunosuppression therapy because of trans￾plantation or other associated disease, one patient had
immunoglobulin deficiency, one patient had azathioprine
for associated autoimmune hepatitis, and another had
chemotherapy for associated lung cancer.
The procedures included lobectomy 50% (n = 15), pneu￾monectomy 10% (n = 3), sublobar resection 26.6% (n = 8),
decortication 6.6% (n = 2), segmentectomy 3% (n = 1),
bullectomy and pleurectomy 3% (n = 1), thoracoplasty 3%
(n = 1) (Table 3). Two patients (6%) underwent lung trans￾plantation for associated cystic fibrosis and emphysema.
Median hospital stay was 9.5 days (3–37). Prolonged
air leak (n = 7, 23%), empyema (n = 6, 20%), reopening
for bleeding (n = 1, 3%), ARDS (n = 1, 3%), respiratory
failure requiring tracheostomy/reintubation (n = 4, 13%)
and bronchopleural fistula (n = 1, 3%) were the noted
complications. Complications were more common in the
CCPA patients (group 2).
Among the 30 patients 23 had preoperative diagnosis of
aspergillosis and were on antifungal therapy. The remaining
7 had an incidental diagnosis of aspergillosis following sur￾gery and received postoperative antifungal therapy. Two pa￾tients had single Aspergillus nodules, and histopathological
examination showed necrosis surrounded by granuloma￾tous inflammation with scattered multinuceate giant cells.
The centre of the necrotic material revealed numerous fun￾gal hyphae and, in one case, conidial heads with features in
keeping with Aspergillus. The surrounding lung paren￾chyma showed fibrosis and a chronic inflammatory cell in￾filtrate. Three patients who had complete resection of the
lesion had no postoperative antifungal therapy. One of
these relapsed and antifungals had to be commenced. Four
patients had postoperative anti-tuberculous medication for
concomitant tuberculosis or non-tuberculous mycobacter￾ial infection.

Nineteen patients received postoperative itraconazole
therapy. Among them seven had to stop itraconazole be￾cause of resistant species or adverse effects. In 16 patients
voriconazole was started because of side effects or
itraconazole resistance. Five patients received posaconazole
postoperatively.
Patients who had intraoperative spillage of Aspergillus
in the pleural cavity had taurolidine 2% lavage and all of
those patients also had intravenous micafungin 150 mg
immediately and then given daily. They subsequently had
oral voriconazole, with later adjustment dependent on
azole susceptibility testing.
There were no peri-operative deaths or within 30 days.
Four patients (13%) died during subsequent follow-up.
In the complex aspergilloma group, the actuarial survival
was less (60% in 5 years) than the simple aspergilloma
group (100% in 5 years) (P = 0.11 (Fisher exact)). Among
the four patients who died, three of them had recurrence
of aspergillosis postoperatively. One patient who had a
double lung transplantation for associated cystic fibrosis
died of a mycotic brain aneurysm few months following
surgery, having developed ARDS after a routine surveil￾lance bronchoscopy and lung biopsy, despite antifungal
therapy [15]. The other patient who had single lung trans￾plantation due to associated emphysema and chronic sar￾coidosis died 48 months following surgery. This patient
did not turn up to the follow up clinic 1 year after the op￾eration. However, during his last postoperative follow up,
the Aspergillus serology was negative. The other two pa￾tients who died had had a left pneumonectomy and a left
upper lobectomy respectively. Both patients had postop￾erative recurrence and complications which included
bronchopleural fistula and a persistent pleural space.
They were deemed unsuitable for any further surgical
intervention.
Recurrence
Eight patients (26%) had recurrence of disease, most hav￾ing prior CCPA (75%). Recurrence was documented by a
combination of clinical, radiological and serological inves￾tigations. Two patients had recurrences in the pneumon￾ectomy space immediately following surgery while the
remainder had late recurrences. Among the patients who
had late recurrences, two had pulmonary recurrence at a
site different from the original location.
Taurolidine MICs
All nine isolates were inhibited by taurolidine at 50 mg/L
(0.1%), and 2 at 25 mg/L (0.05%), indicating a high degree
of in vitro activity, as the solution used in patients topic￾ally is 2%.
Discussions
CPA is more common in the developing countries due to
the high prevalence of pulmonary tuberculosis [1,3].
Alongside this there has been an increase in the number of
invasive aspergillosis cases in developed countries related
to immunosuppression in cancer patients having intense
chemotherapy and for other autoimmune diseases [16].
Like most published series [10,11] tuberculosis was the
commonest underlying disease in our series.
Here we report outcomes from a wide variety of surgical
procedures for chronic pulmonary aspergillosis ranging
from simple wedge resection to bilateral lung transplant￾ation in patients with pulmonary aspergillosis. Most cases
of CPA are managed medically in view of the high mortal￾ity and morbidity [17], with the major exception of single
aspergillomas. Simple aspergilloma cases are rare, most of
our patients having CCPA. Surgery in CCPA is reserved
for cases with complications or those who fail medical
management. In our national centre, surgery has been re￾served for patients with unilateral localised disease, failure
of medical treatment and to deal with complications pro￾vided that their respiratory and performance status were
adequate. Bilateral disease was not considered a contra￾indication per se; one patient with multiple aspergillomas
underwent double lung transplantation for associated cys￾tic fibrosis. Patients with good surgical indications, but poor
nutritional status were considered for PEG feeding to im￾prove their preoperative nutritional status. Two patients in
our series had PEG feeding preoperatively. Preoperative op￾timisation of their respiratory status with intensive physio￾therapy was routine.
Patients who presented with haemoptysis underwent
bronchial artery embolization first. In patients with
failed embolization, surgery was performed. Previous
studies have found embolization to be ineffective or that
it progressed to airway bleeding due to the existence of
multiple feeder arteries from the chest wall [6,7,18].
Some authorities even recommend prophylactic excision of
pulmonary aspergillomas because of risk of massive haem￾optysis [6,18]. More recent angiographic series of bronchial
artery embolization indicate that in ~90% of cases, control

of bleeding is achieved, but that 30-50% patients rebleed by
3 years, especially if CCPA is not controlled with antifungal
therapy [19].
Most of our patients underwent pulmonary resection. In
cases with localised unilateral disease, a wedge resection
was carried out where possible to preserve lung tissue.
Some authorities believe that because of the saprophytic
nature of the organism parenchymal preservation is pref￾erable provided that the rest of the underlying lung is
healthy [11]. These patients who underwent a localised re￾section had a better outcome and in most of them postop￾erative antifungal therapy could be stopped. The more
complex group of patients in our series who underwent
surgery to deal with complications like empyema and
haemoptysis had a worse outcome (Figure 2).
As others have found, patients with simple aspergillomas
had better outcomes when compared to the CCPA group
[9,18]. Compared to other series [9,11,20] we had better re￾sults in terms of intraoperative and 30 day mortality. We
would attribute our preoperative optimisation regimes and
postoperative care schedules as two leading reasons for
this. Several of the studies were from Asia where patients
came from rural areas with a high incidence of underlying
lung disease. Results of different series for the surgical
treatment of this condition have been summarized in
Table 4.
One patient described here underwent completion pneu￾monectomy for aspergillosis in the remaining lung follow￾ing a previous lobectomy for lung cancer. This patient
subsequently developed bronchopleural fistula which was
managed conservatively. Completion pneumonectomy has
previously been reported as having a high morbidity
and mortality in the presence of infection [24]. In these
debilitated and often immunocompromised patients, a
thoracoscopic approach has previously been described
to be associated with better outcome and shorter hos￾pital stay [25]. In our series four patients (13%) under￾went thoracoscopic surgery. All of them had simple
aspergillosis but two of them needed conversion to a
full posterolateral thoracotomy because of intrapleural
adhesions. None of the patients with CCPA were suit￾able for a thoracoscopic approach.
Based on our experience we have concluded that surgery
should be reserved for the following group of patients: Uni￾lateral localised disease, failure of medical treatment or to
deal with complications. In addition, we have summarised
the risk factors for three groups of poor outcome, namely
post-operative Aspergillus empyema, space infection and a
general poor outcome leading to death (Table 5). We can￾not quantify these risks precisely and some are additive,
others not.
The aims of antifungal therapy are to prevent Aspergillus
empyema and to prevent recurrence of CPA post-surgery,
or at least progression, if residual disease remains. Discrete
Aspergillus nodules or simple aspergillomas that are re￾sectable without any spillage of aspergilloma contents into
the pleural space probably do not require any antifungal
therapy [26]. If given, it was discontinued after surgery if a
complete resection had been done. Adjuvant antifungal
pharmacotherapy does not improve the results of surgical
treatment for isolated pulmonary aspergillosis where a full
curative resection has been carried out [26]. In the event

that such spillage occurs unexpectedly, then washout of
the pleural space with either amphotericin B deoxycholate
or taurolidine is a reasonable, if unproven, measure to pre￾vent Aspergillus empyema. Aspergillus empyema is a diffi￾cult to treat entity, probably requiring long term antifungal
therapy and may lead to pleural fibrosis and a significant
restrictive pulmonary defect if only a lobectomy or wedge
resection is done.
We also recommend peri-operative antifungal therapy
for patients with multi-cavity disease, in whom surgery is
done because of significant haemoptysis or in an attempt
to improve quality of life, or in patients in whom resection
of the primary disease is likely to lead to pleural spillage.
Our standard practice is to start voriconazole 2 weeks be￾fore surgery, check plasma concentrations before surgery
and adjust dose if necessary and continue IV therapy
through the peri-operative period. Numerous drug inter￾actions need to be considered, including marked pro￾longation of sedation post-operatively. We have seen
patients unconscious for 24 hours after surgery because of
the excessive effect of midazolam for example. If patients
are on an azole prior to surgery and there is a risk of azole

resistance, we use micafungin 150 mg daily pre- and peri￾operatively. In either circumstance, if no spillage occurs,
we will stop antifungal therapy shortly after surgery, but
give at least 2 months therapy if here has been spillage to
minimize the risk of pleural aspergillosis. If patients have
residual cavitary disease, we will treat post-operatively
long term to prevent recurrence, just as we do in patients
who do not undergo surgery [27,28].
In some patients lobectomy or pneumonectomy is
possibly hazardous but a surgical necessity. Management
of postoperative complications in this difficult patient
group can be challenging. Creation of a modest sized fis￾tula (the larger the better) is sometimes one approach.
This is particularly so in patients with other medical
problems and/or poor respiratory function, and amounts
to a palliative procedure.
In patients unfit for a lobectomy drainage of the cavity
(especially if there is a concurrent bacterial infection),
pre-operative PEG feeding is a good first step. Following
a stabilization, these patients could proceed to a defini￾tive procedure if medically fit thereafter.
A difficult group of patients are those with CCPA who
are left with a persistent space following resection. These
space problems might be dealt with a pectoralis flap,
modest thoracoplasty, or both. Use of a muscle flap
reduces the extent of a thoracoplasty, which is helpful
for later functioning of the chest. The advantage of the
muscle flaps is that it often nearly fills the cavity initially,
and then atrophies, leaving considerable space. Later
post-op chest x rays show a small finger of muscle,
but this is believed to be sufficient to keep Aspergillus
from recolonising the cavity. Only one patient in our
series underwent a thoracoplasty procedure. We planned
thoracoplasty on another patient following resection;
however as the patient was not fit for general anaesthesia
and it couldn’t be carried out.
Postoperative follow-up continued for least 12 months,
at 2 months initially and then 4 monthly, with Aspergillus
IgG titres and a chest radiograph at a year. If there
were no residual abnormalities, they were followed up
for 3 years. Patients were asked to contact us on dis￾charge if they had any new symptoms to allow us to
identify expeditiously and treat patients with recurrence.
Aspergillus IgG antibody titres usually fell very slowly
following surgery, and would often level off remaining
persistently elevated.
Conclusions
Although this is a small series, it includes a wide var￾iety of procedures that were carried out to deal with
this difficult problem. We believe that proper pre￾operative optimisation and good postoperative care
played a pivotal role in achieving these good results.
The presence of a National Centre for aspergillosis
and the dedicated multidisciplinary approach help
maintain these high standards in our unit. We have
also successfully formulated a postoperative follow up
protocol which enabled early detection of recurrent
disease.
We noticed more complications in the initial part of the
series before designation as the National Aspergillosis
Centre. Increasing experience and super specialisation has
resulted in good overall outcomes. We conclude that all
surgery for chronic aspergillosis should be concentrated in
experienced centres. Collation of the European experience
of surgical management of these cases would be a useful
database. Defining strategies to select the right procedure
for the right patient would be the primary aim, combined
with peri-operative action plans (use of antifungals, pleural
washes), actual procedural details, follow up regimes and
recurrence rates.
