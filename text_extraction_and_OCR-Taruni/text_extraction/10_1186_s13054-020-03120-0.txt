Abstract
An outbreak of pneumonia caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that started in
Wuhan, China, at the end of 2019 has become a global pandemic. Both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV enter host cells
via the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, which is expressed in various human organs. We have
reviewed previously published studies on SARS and recent studies on SARS-CoV-2 infection, named coronavirus
disease 2019 (COVID-19) by the World Health Organization (WHO), confirming that many other organs besides the
lungs are vulnerable to the virus. ACE2 catalyzes angiotensin II conversion to angiotensin-(1–7), and the ACE2/
angiotensin-(1–7)/MAS axis counteracts the negative effects of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), which plays
important roles in maintaining the physiological and pathophysiological balance of the body. In addition to the
direct viral effects and inflammatory and immune factors associated with COVID-19 pathogenesis, ACE2
downregulation and the imbalance between the RAS and ACE2/angiotensin-(1–7)/MAS after infection may also
contribute to multiple organ injury in COVID-19. The SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein, which binds to ACE2, is a
potential target for developing specific drugs, antibodies, and vaccines. Restoring the balance between the RAS and
ACE2/angiotensin-(1–7)/MAS may help attenuate organ injuries.

Background
At the end of 2019, an outbreak of a novel coronavirus
(2019-nCoV) was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province,
China [1, 2]. The outbreak has become a global pan￾demic. This virus seems to be much more contagious
than severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) corona￾virus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East Respiratory Syn￾drome (MERS) coronavirus (MERS-CoV). By the end of
June 8, 2020, there have been more than 7,000,000 con￾firmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19),
with nearly 400,000 fatalities worldwide.
Full-length genome sequencing revealed that 2019-
nCoV shares 79.5% sequence identity with SARS-CoV,
and pairwise protein sequence analysis found that it
belonged to the class of SARS-related coronaviruses [3].
Both 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV enter host cell via the
same receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)
[3]. Therefore, this virus was subsequently renamed
SARS-CoV-2. Although the overall mortality rate of
COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 is lower than that of
SARS and MERS, organ dysfunction, such as acute re￾spiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute cardiac in￾jury, acute hepatic injury, and acute kidney injury are
quite common in severe cases. ACE2, a homolog of
angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), which is
expressed in a variety of human organs and tissues, has
extensive biological activities and can counteract the
negative role of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in

many diseases [4–6]. Considering that the spike protein
of SARS-CoV-2 interacts with ACE2, as does that of
SARS-CoV, COVID-19 may have a pathogenic mechan￾ism similar to that of SARS. In this review, we will dis￾cuss the role of ACE2 in COVID-19, and its potential
therapeutic targets, aiming to provide more information
on the management of the epidemic.
RAS and ACE2
The RAS is a complex network that plays an important
role in maintaining blood pressure as well as electrolyte
and fluid homeostasis, affecting the function of many or￾gans, such as the heart, blood vessels, and kidneys [6].
Angiotensin II (Ang-II), which is the most representative
bioactive peptide in the RAS, widely participates in the
progression of cardiovascular diseases, such as hyperten￾sion, myocardial infarction, and heart failure [7]. In the
classic RAS, renin cleaves the substrate angiotensinogen
to form the decapeptide angiotensin I (Ang-I), and then,
ACE removes two amino acids at the carboxyl terminus
of Ang-I to yield Ang-II (Fig. 1). To date, three Ang-II
receptors have been identified, and the affinities of these
receptors for Ang-II are similar, in the nanomolar range
[7]. Among these receptors, angiotensin type 1 receptor
(AT1R) binds to Ang-II, causing vasoconstriction, cell
proliferation, inflammatory responses, blood coagulation,
and extracellular matrix remodeling, whereas angioten￾sin type 2 receptor (AT2R) counteracts the aforemen￾tioned effects mediated by AT1R [8].
In 2000, two independent research groups discovered
ACE2, a homolog of ACE, which can remove the
carboxy-terminal phenylalanine in Ang-II to form the
heptapeptide angiotensin-(1–7) [4, 9]. In addition, under
the alternating effects of ACE2 and ACE, angiotensin-
(1–7) can be formed without Ang-II (Fig. 1). In this
metabolic pathway, Ang-I is first hydrolyzed by ACE2 to
form angiotensin-(1–9), and angiotensin-(1–9) is then
hydrolyzed by ACE to form angiotensin-(1–7). Ang-I
can also be directly converted to angiotensin-(1–7) by
endopeptidases and oligopeptidases [6]. Because of the
higher affinity between ACE and Ang-I, the classical
pathway of Ang-II to angiotensin-(1–7) is more common
[6]. Angiotensin-(1–7), as a ligand, binds to the G￾protein-coupled receptor MAS, which produces the op￾posite effect to that of Ang-II, and exerts a range of
functions in multiple organs/systems [5, 6]. In addition
to catalyzing the production of angiotensin-(1–7), ACE2
is involved in the uptake of amino acids in intestinal epi￾thelial cells [10].
ACE2 mediates SARS-CoV-2 infection
Entry into host cells is the first step of viral infection. A
spike glycoprotein on the viral envelope of the corona￾virus can bind to specific receptors on the membrane of
host cells. Previous studies have shown that ACE2 is a
specific functional receptor for SARS-CoV [11]. Zhou
et al. showed that SARS-CoV-2 can enter ACE2-
expressing cells, but not cells without ACE2 or cells ex￾pressing other coronavirus receptors, such as aminopep￾tidase N and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), confirming
that ACE2 is the cell receptor for SARS-CoV-2 [3]. Fur￾ther studies showed that the binding affinity of the
SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein to ACE2 is 10- to 20-
fold higher than that of SARS-CoV to ACE2 [12]. The
probable mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 entry into host
cells based on SARS-CoV studies is displayed in Fig. 2.
Briefly, the receptor-binding domain of the spike glyco￾protein binds to the tip of subdomain I of ACE2 [11–
14]. Membrane fusion of the virus and the host cell is
activated after binding, and viral RNA is subsequently
released into the cytoplasm, establishing infection. For
SARS-CoV infection, intact ACE2 or its transmembrane
domain is internalized together with the virus [15]. The
catalytically active site of ACE2 is not occluded by the
spike glycoprotein, and the binding process is independ￾ent of the peptidase activity of ACE2 [14]. Some trans￾membrane proteinases (such as a disintegrin and
metallopeptidase domain 17 [ADAM17], transmembrane
protease serine 2 [TMPRSS2], and TNF-converting en￾zyme) and proteins (such as vimentin and clathrin) may
be involved in the binding and membrane fusion pro￾cesses [16–21]. For example, ADAM17 can cleave ACE2
to cause ectodomain shedding, and TMPRSS2 can cleave
ACE2 to promote viral uptake [16, 17].
ACE2 is expressed in nearly all human organs in varying
degrees. In the respiratory system, the traditional immuno￾histochemical method and recently introduced single-cell
RNA-seq analysis revealed that ACE2 is mainly expressed
on type II alveolar epithelial cells, but weakly expressed on
the surface of epithelial cells in the oral and nasal mucosa
and nasopharynx, indicating that the lungs are the primary
target of SARS-CoV-2 [22, 23]. Moreover, ACE2 is highly
expressed on myocardial cells, proximal tubule cells of the
kidney, and bladder urothelial cells, and is abundantly
expressed on the enterocytes of the small intestine, espe￾cially in the ileum [22–24]. The cell-free and macrophage
phagocytosis-associated virus may spread from the lungs to
other organs with high ACE2 expression through blood cir￾culation (Fig. 2). For example, up to 67% of patients who
developed diarrhea during the course of SARS and quite a
number of patients with COVID-19 showed enteric symp￾toms [25–27]. Active viral replication in enterocytes of the
small intestine has been reported, and SARS-CoV-2 has
been successfully isolated from fecal specimens [28, 29].
ACE2 is associated with multi-organ injury in COVID-19
Autopsies of SARS patients showed that SARS-CoV in￾fection can cause injury to multiple organs, such as the
Ni et al. Critical Care (2020) 24:422 Page 2 of 10

heart, kidney, liver, skeletal muscle, central nervous sys￾tem, and adrenal and thyroid glands, besides the lungs
[30, 31]. Most critically ill patients with COVID-19 also
had multiple organ damage, including acute lung injury,
acute kidney injury, cardiac injury, liver dysfunction, and
pneumothorax [32]. As with SARS and COVID-19,
organ injury is also frequently observed in MERS, espe￾cially the gastrointestinal tract and kidneys, while the in￾cidence of acute cardiac injury is less common [33–36].
Unlike SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, MESR-CoV uses
DPP4 as its entry receptor, which is mainly expressed on
pneumocytes, multinucleated epithelial cells, and bron￾chial submucosal gland cells of the lungs; epithelial cells
of the kidney and small intestine; and activated leuko￾cytes [37–39]. DPP4 is not abundantly expressed on
myocardial cells [37–39]. Therefore, this indicates that
organ involvement and injury is strongly associated with
receptor distribution in the body.
According to the results of a series of studies on SARS,
the pathogenesis of COVID-19 should be complex. The
virus-induced inflammatory responses, including the ex￾cessive expression of cytokines and chemokines, exces￾sive recruitment of inflammatory cells, insufficient
interferon response, and possible production of auto￾antibodies are deemed to be vital factors in disease
pathogenesis [30]. Pro-inflammatory cytokines (PICs)
and chemokines in plasma, such as interleukin (IL)-1,
IL-6, IL-12, IL-8, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1
(MCP-1), and interferon-gamma-inducible protein 10
(IP-10), are significantly elevated in the plasma of
Fig. 1 The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and ACE2/angiotensin-(1–7)/MAS axis. The protease renin converts angiotensinogen to Ang-I, which is
subsequently converted to Ang-II by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). Ang-II can bind to the angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT1R) to exert
actions, such as vasoconstriction, hypertrophy, fibrosis, proliferation, inflammation, and oxidative stress. ACE2 can covert Ang-I and Ang-II to
angiotensin-(1–7). Angiotensin-(1–7) binds to the MAS receptor to exert actions of vasodilation, vascular protection, anti-fibrosis, anti-proliferation,
and anti-inflammation. Ang-II can also bind to the angiotensin type 2 receptor (AT2R) to counteract the aforementioned effects mediated
by AT1R
Ni et al. Critical Care (2020) 24:422 Page 3 of 10

patients with SARS [40, 41]. Significantly increased
plasma concentrations of these PICs were also found in
severe patients with COVID-19 [1]. Autopsy studies of
SARS patients further found that PICs and MCP-1 were
highly expressed in SARS-CoV-infected ACE2+ cells,
but not in tissues without infected ACE2+ cells, suggest￾ing virus-induced local immune-mediated damage [42].
In addition to acting as the receptor for SARS-CoV
and SARS-CoV-2, ACE2 hydrolyzes Ang-II to
angiotensin-(1–7), and the ACE2/angiotensin-(1–7)/
MAS counteracts the negative effects of the RAS and ex￾erts anti-inflammatory effects [6, 43]. Several studies
have shown that SARS-CoV infection can downregulate
ACE2 expression on cells, thereby disrupting the physio￾logical balance between ACE/ACE2 and Ang-II/angio￾tensin-(1–7) and subsequently causing severe organ
injury [44–47]. Given that SARS-CoV-2 is a species of
SARS-related coronaviruses and uses ACE2 as its
Fig. 2 A model for the process of SARS-CoV-2 entering host cells in the lungs and attacking other organs. SARS-CoV-2 enters the lungs, where
the spike glycoprotein of the virus binds to ACE2 on cells, allowing the virus enter the cells. Some transmembrane proteinases, such as
transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) and a disintegrin metallopeptidase domain 17 (ADAM17) also participate in this process. For
example, SARS-CoV-2 can use TMPRSS2 for spike protein priming in cell lines. The infected cells and inflammatory cells stimulated by viral
antigens can produce pro-inflammatory cytokines (PICs) and chemokines to activate immunological reactions and inflammatory responses to
combat the viruses. Cell-free and macrophage-phagocytosed viruses in the blood can be transmitted to other organs and infect ACE2-expressing
cells at local sites
Ni et al. Critical Care (2020) 24:422 Page 4 of 10

receptor, the downregulation of ACE2 expression may
be involved in multiple organ injury in COVID-19.
Based on previous studies on SARS and recent studies
on SARS-CoV-2, the multiple organ injury in COVID-19
(Fig. 3) and the possible role of ACE2 in organ injury
are described below.
Acute lung injury
Although the mortality rate in COVID-19 is lower than
that in SARS and MERS, numerous patients have acute
lung injury (ALI) after infection [26, 32]. Similar to the
pathological features of SARS and MERS, severe diffuse
alveolar damage, such as extensive edema, hyaline mem￾brane formation, inflammatory infiltrates, microthrombi
formation, organization, and fibrosis, was also observed
in COVID-19, but with more cellular fibromyxoid exu￾dates in the alveoli and small airways [48, 49]. The role
of the RAS and ACE2 in ARDS/ALI has drawn great at￾tention since the outbreak of SARS in 2003. Clinical
studies have found that ACE insertion/deletion poly￾morphism may be correlated with the severity of ARDS
[50, 51]. High Ang-II levels in the lungs can increase
vascular permeability and cause pulmonary edema [52,
53]. Several studies have revealed the protective effects
of the ACE2/angiotensin-(1–7)/MAS axis in the lungs. It
alleviates lung inflammation, fibrosis, and pulmonary ar￾terial hypertension, as well as inhibiting cancer cell
growth, tumor angiogenesis, and tumor metastasis [6,
54–56]. In different animal models of ALI, ACE2-
knockout mice exhibited enhanced vascular permeabil￾ity, increased lung edema, neutrophil accumulation, and
marked worsening of lung function compared with wild￾type control mice [56]. Injection of recombinant human
ACE2 protein or AT1R blockers into ACE2-knockout
mice could decrease the degree of ALI [56].
SARS-CoV infection considerably reduces ACE2 ex￾pression in mouse lungs [46]. Further experiments
showed that mere binding of recombinant SARS-CoV
spike-Fc to human and mouse ACE2 could result in the
downregulation of cell-surface ACE2 expression [46].
The spike-Fc protein worsened acid-induced ALI in
wild-type mice, but did not affect the severity of lung
failure in ACE2-knockout mice, indicating that the effect
of spike protein on ALI is ACE2-specific [46]. Studies on
influenza also found that ACE2 was significantly down￾regulated after H1N1 infection [57]. ACE2 deficiency
significantly worsened the pathogenesis in infected mice,
and inhibition of AT1 alleviated the severity of influenza
H7N9 virus-induced lung injury [58, 59]. Moreover,
Ang-II levels were elevated in H5N1- and H7N9-
infected patients, which was associated with the sever￾ity of lung injury and predicted fatal outcomes in
H7N9-infected patients [59, 60]. In patients with
COVID-19, plasma Ang-II levels were markedly ele￾vated and linearly associated with viral load and lung
injury [61]. All these findings suggest that the RAS
and ACE2 downregulation contribute to the patho￾genesis of lung injury in COVID-19.

Acute cardiac injury
The heart abundantly expresses ACE2, indicating that it
is vulnerable to SARS-Cov-2 infection. Autopsies of pa￾tients with SARS revealed that 35% of them (7 of 20)
were positive for the SARS-CoV genome in cardiac tis￾sue, and patients with SARS-CoV cardiac infections had
a more aggressive illness and earlier mortality than those
without [47]. Edema of the myocardial stroma, inflam￾matory cell infiltration, and atrophy of cardiac muscle fi￾bers was observed in patients with SARS and myocardial
damage [30, 31, 62–64]. Cardiac injury is quite common
among severely ill patients with COVID-19, and we
found that early acute myocardial injury was associated
with a higher risk of mortality [65].
The beneficial role of the ACE2/angiotensin-(1–7)/
MAS axis in the heart has been well demonstrated [6]. It
can induce vasorelaxation of coronary vessels, inhibit
oxidative stress, attenuate pathological cardiac remodel￾ing, and improve postischemic heart function [66].
ACE2 expression usually increases at the initial stage of
heart injury, but decreases as the disease progresses [7].
ACE2 knockout in mice results in myocardial hyper￾trophy and interstitial fibrosis and accelerates heart fail￾ure [67, 68]. In addition, ACE2 knockout in mice
aggravates cardiac dysfunction caused by diabetes [69].
In both SARS-CoV-infected mice and humans, ACE2
expression in myocardial cells is markedly downregu￾lated in the heart [47]. According to recent studies [26,
70] and our data [65], a substantial number of patients
with severe disease have hypertension as a comorbidity.
Over-activation of the RAS may have already occurred
in these individuals before infection. The significant
downregulation of ACE2 and upregulation of Ang-II in
COVID-19 results in RAS over-activation, and loss of
the protective effects of angiotensin-(1–7) may aggravate
and perpetuate cardiac injuries.
Digestive system injury
The gastrointestinal tract, especially the intestine, is vul￾nerable to SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infections.
SARS-CoV particles have been detected in epithelial
cells of the intestinal mucosa, but not in the esophagus
and stomach [30, 42]. The main pathological finding in
the intestines of patients with SARS was the depletion of
mucosal lymphoid tissue [71]. Only mild focal inflamma￾tion was detected in the gastrointestinal tract [71]. These
findings may explain why gastrointestinal manifestations
in COVID-19 are not severe and are transient.
Many patients with COVID-19 show a slight to mod￾erate increase in serum levels of alanine aminotransfer￾ase (ALT) and/or aspartate aminotransferase (AST)
during the course of infection [26, 72]. Autopsies of
SARS patients revealed fatty degeneration, hepatocyte
necrosis, and cellular infiltration in the liver [30].
However, SARS-CoV was not detected in the hepatic tis￾sue of most patients autopsied [30]. Both immunohisto￾chemistry and single-cell RNA-seq analyses showed that
hepatocytes, Kupffer cells, and the endothelial lining of
the sinusoids were negative for ACE2; only cholangio￾cytes were positive for ACE2 [22, 23, 73]. Gamma-gluta￾myl transpeptidase (GGT), which reflects cholangiocyte
damage, was elevated in some COVID-19 patients [74].
These findings indicate that most acute hepatic injury
may not be due to virus infection, but is highly likely due
to other causes, such as drug hepatotoxicity, hypoxia, and
systemic inflammation. Whether SARS-CoV-2 causes
damage to the bile ducts by binding with ACE2 on cho￾langiocytes requires further investigation.
Acute kidney injury
ACE2 is highly expressed in the kidney, especially in the
apical membranes of proximal tubular epithelial cells,
suggesting that the kidney is another target of SARS￾CoV-2 [22, 23, 75]. Moreover, an imbalance between
Ang-II and angiotensin-(1–7) caused by ACE2 deficiency
may aggravate the vulnerability of the kidney to other
factors causing acute kidney injury (AKI) [76]. SARS￾CoV was detected in epithelial cells of the distal tubules,
and viral sequences were identified in urinary samples
from some patients [77, 78]. SARS-CoV-2 has also been
isolated from urinary samples [79]. A retrospective ana￾lysis of 536 SARS patients showed that 6.7% of patients
developed acute renal impairment during the course of
the disease [80]. A large cohort study from New York
showed that the incidence of AKI among patients with
COVID-19 could reach 36.6% [81].
Other organ and tissue injuries
Pancreas
Pancreatic cells highly express ACE2, indicating that
COVID-19 may affect the pancreas [82]. It has been re￾ported that up to 16% of patients with severe COVID-19
have elevated serum amylase and lipase levels, with 7%
displaying accompanying significant pancreatic changes
on CT scans [83]. Clinical presentation of acute pancrea￾titis has been reported in patients with COVID-19 [84].
ACE2/angiotensin-(1–7) plays a protective role in dia￾betes by improving pancreatic β cell survival, stimulating
insulin secretion, and reducing insulin resistance [6].
Studies have shown that, compared to patients with
non-SARS pneumonia, many more SARS patients who
had no previous diabetes and had not received steroid
treatment developed insulin-dependent acute diabetes
during hospitalization [85, 86]. Moreover, plasma glu￾cose levels and diabetes are independent predictors of
mortality in patients with SARS [86]. Autopsies of some
SARS patients found atrophy and amyloid degeneration
in most pancreatic islets, suggesting the virus causes
Ni et al. Critical Care (2020) 24:422 Page 6 of 10

damage to the islets [64]. Therefore, COVID-19 may
also influence pancreatic function, similar to SARS, and
glucose levels should be closely monitored, especially in
patients with diabetes or glucocorticoid treatment.
Skeletal muscles
Muscle weakness and elevated serum creatine kinase
(CK) levels were observed in more than 30% of patients
with SARS [87]. Mildly to moderately elevated CK levels
were also observed in patients with COVID-19 on ad￾mission [88]. Myofiber necrosis and atrophy were ob￾served in skeletal muscle tissues, but no SARS-CoV
particles were detected by electron microscopy [30, 89].
Recent studies revealed that the RAS plays an important
role in the pathogenesis of various skeletal muscle disor￾ders, and the ACE2/angiotensin-(1–7)/MAS axis exerts
protective effects against muscle atrophy [6]. Neverthe￾less, whether SARS-CoV-2 attacks the muscles and
whether the downregulation of ACE2 is associated with
myopathy is unclear.
Central nervous system
ACE2 is widely present in the brain, predominantly in
neurons, and participates in the neural regulation of
broad physiological functions, such as cardiovascular
and metabolic activities, stress response, and neurogen￾esis [6, 90, 91]. In a mouse model, SARS-CoV invaded
the brain through the olfactory bulb and then spread
transneuronally to other areas [92]. Olfactory and gusta￾tory dysfunctions have been reported in many patients
with COVID-19, suggesting the involvement of the ol￾factory bulb in SARS-CoV-2 infection [93, 94]. SARS￾CoV was isolated from human brain tissue specimens
[31, 95]. Autopsies showed edema and focal degener￾ation of neurons in the brains of patients with SARS [30,
31]. Many patients (78/214) had neurologic manifesta￾tions in COVID-19, and SARS-CoV-2 was detected in
the cerebrospinal fluid of a patient with encephalitis [96,
97]. Considering that SARS-CoV-2 has a much higher
affinity for its receptor (ACE2) than SARS-CoV, the
former could be capable of infecting and damaging the
central nervous system.
Blood vessels
ACE2 is also expressed in the endothelial cells of small
and large blood vessels, and the vascular endothelium
can produce angiotensin-(1–7) [6, 22]. The ACE2/angio￾tensin-(1–7)/MAS axis induces vasodilatory, antiprolifer￾ative, and antithrombotic effects in the vasculature [6].
SARS RNA can be detected in the endothelia of the
small veins in many tissues [98]. Plasma D-dimer levels
are significantly elevated in severely ill patients with
COVID-19 [1, 32, 72], and the occurrence of dissemi￾nated intravascular coagulation (DIC) at the early stage
of the disease is not rare. Viral infection and inflamma￾tory responses damage the integrity of the vascular
endothelium, causing increased permeability, coagula￾tion activation, and microcirculation disturbances, which
may contribute to organ injury in COVID-19.
Potential targets and drugs
As ACE2 is the receptor for both SARS-CoV and SARS￾CoV-2, and some transmembrane proteinases such as
ADAM17 and TMPRSS are involved in binding and
membrane fusion processes, these sites may be potential
targets in the development of antiviral drugs for
COVID-19 treatment. For example, serum samples from
patients with convalescent SARS can neutralize spike￾driven entry of SARS-CoV-2 into host cells, suggesting
that vaccines targeting the spike protein will be promis￾ing [18]. Studies have found that SARS-CoV-specific
monoclonal antibodies and recombinant ACE2-Ig can
potently neutralize SARS-CoV-2, and a hexapeptide of
the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein binds
to ACE2, thus blocking SARS-CoV entry [18, 99–101].
The downregulation of ACE2 in organs after virus in￾fection disturbs the local balance between the RAS and
ACE2/angiotensin-(1–7)/MAS axis, which may be asso￾ciated with organ injuries. Animal studies have found
that ACE inhibitor (ACEI) therapy can increase plasma
angiotensin-(1–7) levels, decrease plasma Ang-II levels,
and increase cardiac ACE2 expression, whereas angio￾tensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) can increase the
plasma levels of both Ang-II and angiotensin-(1–7) as
well as the cardiac expression and activity of ACE2
[102]. Thus, the use of ACEIs/ARBs, renin inhibitors,
and angiotensin-(1–7) analogs may attenuate organ in￾juries by blocking the renin-angiotensin pathway and/or
increasing angiotensin-(1–7) levels [103]. Other animal
studies showed that ALI mediated by SARS-CoV spike
or the influenza virus in mice could be rescued by the
use of ARBs [46, 60, 104]. In a population-based study,
the application of ACEIs and ARBs significantly reduced
the 30-day mortality rate of patients with pneumonia re￾quiring hospitalization [105]. There are also concerns
that treatment with ACEIs/ARBs may facilitate infection
and increase the risk of developing severe and fatal
COVID-19 by increasing ACE2 expression levels in tar￾get organs [106]. However, two large cohort studies
showed that ACEIs/ARBs use was not associated with
increased SARS-CoV-2 infection, but was associated
with a lower risk of all-cause mortality in hospitalized
patients [107, 108]. Further studies are needed to test
the protective effects of ACEIs/ARBs in COVID-19.
Conclusions
The RAS and ACE2/angiotensin-(1–7)/MAS axis play im￾portant roles in various physiological and pathophysiological
Ni et al. Critical Care (2020) 24:422 Page 7 of 10

contexts. Both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV use ACE2 as
the receptor for entry into host cells. Because ACE2 is highly
expressed in various organs and tissues, SARS-CoV-2 not
only invades the lungs but also attacks other organs with
high ACE2 expression. The pathogenesis of COVID-19 is
highly complex, with multiple factors involved. In addition
to the direct viral effects and inflammatory and immune fac￾tors, the downregulation of ACE2 and imbalance between
the RAS and ACE2/angiotensin-(1–7)/MAS axis may also
contribute to the multiple organ injuries in COVID-19. The
spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 is a potential target for
the development of specific drugs, antibodies, and vaccines.
Restoring the balance between the RAS and ACE2/angio￾tensin-(1–7)/MAS may help attenuate organ injuries in
COVID-19.
