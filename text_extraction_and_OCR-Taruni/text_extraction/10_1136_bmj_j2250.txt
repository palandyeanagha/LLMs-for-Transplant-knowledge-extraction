Life expectancy difference and life expectancy ratio:
two measures of treatment effects in randomised trials
with non-proportional hazards
 OPEN ACCESS
The hazard ratio (HR) is the most common measure of treatment effect in clinical trials that use
time-to-event outcomes such as survival. When survival curves cross over or separate only after a
considerable time, the proportional hazards assumption of the Cox model is violated, and HR can
be misleading. We present two measures of treatment effects for situations where the HR changes
over time: the life expectancy difference (LED) and life expectancy ratio (LER). LED is the difference
between mean survival times in the intervention and control arms. LER is the ratio of these two
times. LED and LER can be calculated for at least two time intervals during the trial, allowing for
curves where the treatment effect changes over time. The two measures are readily interpretable
as absolute and relative gains or losses in life expectancy.

Summary
When survival curves cross over or separate
only after considerable time in a trial, the hazard
ratio (HR) is not an appropriate summary
measure of treatment effect, because the
proportional hazards assumption of the Cox
model is violated and the HR changes with time
Life expectancy difference (LED) and life
expectancy ratio (LER) are complementary
absolute and relative measures that can be
calculated for any shape of survival curves
LED is obtained by taking the difference between
the mean survival times in the intervention and
control arms restricted between two time points,
usually the beginning of the trial and the end of
follow-up; the LER is the ratio of these two
quantities
LED and LER have intuitive interpretations as
absolute and relative gains or losses in life
expectancy due to an intervention
In randomised controlled trials (RCTs), time-to-event endpoints,
such as overall survival or time to disease occurrence, are shown
as Kaplan-Meier curves. The effect of an intervention compared
with a control is quantified by comparing two survival curves
to generate the hazard ratio (HR) and the difference in medians
(when estimable), which are measures of relative and absolute
effects, respectively. HR is the ratio of hazards between two
treatment groups, estimated using a Cox regression model. The
hazards are the instantaneous rates of occurrence of events that
underlie the survival curves; for example, the instantaneous risk
of death in the treatment group. This approach is only valid if
the hazards are proportional to each other over time (⇓). The
proportional hazards assumption places no constraint on the
shape of one survival curve (usually the control group), only
on the shape of the second (the experimental group) in relation
to the other. This implies that the HR is independent of time
and that the survival curves are distinct from each other and do
not cross over. Median survival can be reported for any shape
of curve but occurs at only one time point—it ignores the rest
of the curve and can be affected by chance variability.
If the curves cross over or overlap for a considerable period of
follow-up (more than a quarter of the follow-up period) before
separating (⇓), the assumption of proportional hazards fails.
This also occurs if the treatment has an early effect, where initial
separation of the survival curves gets smaller or even disappears
over time. HR is constant over time when the curves have
proportional hazards (⇓), but it changes when they do not (⇓).
These patterns have been observed in oncology,1-3 nephrology,4
and cardiovascular and infectious diseases5-7 (see supplementary
figure 1). Despite HRs being misleading for non-proportional

hazards, they are still the most commonly reported measure of
effect, because they are readily available in all standard
statistical software and are considered the standard measure for
time-to-event outcomes.
An alternative recommended measure is the restricted mean
survival time (RMST),8
 which is the area under a survival curve
between two time points, typically the time of randomisation
and the end of the follow-up period (⇓).9
 The RMST of an
overall survival curve is a measure of the average duration of
survival over the follow-up period.6-10 A treatment effect can
then be quantified as the difference in RMSTs or ratio of RMSTs
between the experimental and control arms.
Life expectancy difference (LED) and life
expectancy ratio (LER)
RMST can be calculated in four ways, which use either the
Kaplan-Meier curve or a modelled curve that has been fitted to
the observed data (Boxed Text on page 2box 1; see web extra
1 in data supplement).
Box 1Methods of estimating RMST
Numerical integration of the Kaplan-Meier curve
Numerical integration of the modelled survival
curve obtained using Cox regression
Numerical integration of the modelled survival
curve obtained using flexible parametric
modelling
Calculation of leave-one-out estimates of RMST
(using any of the above methods) multiple times
and taking an average
The difference between two RMSTs (experimental minus
control) is called the life expectancy difference (LED). It is a
measure of absolute effect, measured in units of time.8
Experimental RMST divided by control RMST is the life
expectancy ratio (LER), a measure of relative effect.10 For
endpoints other than overall survival, the definition of life
expectancy can be changed; for example, for progression-free
survival (PFS), we could use the labels LEDWP
 and LERWP
 to
indicate “without progression.”
When hazards are non-proportional, HR changes over time.
Using RMST, however, allows us to calculate more than one
measure of LED or LER because we can specify the time range.
Using simulation studies we estimated LED and LER for the
two common forms of non-proportional hazards shown in ⇓ and
⇓, using the four different methods for calculating an RMST
(see web extra 2 for more details). Three methods had similar
accuracy, of which the flexible parametric model seemed better
than the others when the trial sample size was small. We provide
simple STATA code to allow estimation of the LED and LER
in web extra 3.
Examples
We calculated LED and LER for three examples using a flexible
parametric model (⇓).
Example 1: Curves that diverge
This randomised trial of 370 patients examined the addition of
rituximab to standard chemotherapy for patients with untreated
mantle cell lymphoma.11 The Grambsch-Therneau test for
non-proportional hazards was statistically significant (P=0.025).
⇓ shows the Kaplan-Meier curves for overall survival. The LER
of 1.36 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.10 to 1.63) indicates
that rituximab increased life expectancy by 36% (as a relative
measure). The reciprocal of 1.36 is 0.73, which is close to the
HR of 0.69. This seemingly intuitive comparison should be
interpreted with caution because although HR and LER both
measure effect on a relative scale, they are different measures
with different meanings.10 The difference in median survival is
7.5 months, much smaller than the LED of 17.7 months (95%
CI 6.7 to 28.7), which indicates that life expectancy has
improved by 17.7 months. LED is a more appropriate
comparison of the survival experience between the two treatment
groups. Calculations of the LED and LER are provided in web
extra 1.
Example 2: Curves that cross
The survival curves of a randomised trial investigating a drug
called ADI-PEG20 in 68 patients with malignant pleural
mesothelioma12 cross over (Grambsh-Therneau test of
non-proportionality P=0.02) at approximately 10 months (⇓).
The overall HR of 0.68 (95% CI 0.39 to 1.16) gives the false
impression of benefit throughout the whole follow-up. Having
a single measure of treatment effect (either HR or LER) is
misleading given the shape of the curves.
We estimated the LED and LER before and after 10 months to
provide a more accurate assessment of the treatment profile.
Before 10 months, life expectancy with ADI-PEG20 is lower
than control by 0.5 months and reduced by 6% (LER=0.94).
After 10 months, the LED is 3.8 months and LER is 2.07 (but
not statistically significant), indicating beneficial effects for
ADI-PEG20.
Another example of curves that cross, using simulated data of
250 patients and 247 events, is shown in ⇓. The overall LED is
0.4 months and LER is 1.06, which clearly shows how
statistically significant beneficial effects seen in later months
(LER is 3.01 after seven months) can be counterbalanced by
statistically significant harmful effects in early months (LER is
0.85 before seven months). This results in little net effect over
the whole follow-up period.
An alternative to calculating the LED and LER before and after
the crossing point is to use the time at which the HR (calculated
using flexible parametric survival modelling13) becomes
<1—that is, when the experimental treatment begins to have a
beneficial effect. This objective approach might minimise the
appearance of arbitrarily choosing cut-off time points.
Example 3: Curves that separate later on
Here, we used simulated data for 250 patients and 197 deaths
(⇓). The HR of 0.68 indicates a clear benefit, but the median
values are close together, producing a small difference in
medians of only 0.3 months. The LER of 1.46 (95% CI 1.09 to
1.83) shows that life expectancy is increased by 46%. The LED
clearly shows an absolute improvement in life expectancy (2.4
months; 95% CI 0.8 to 4.0), making it a more appropriate
measure than the difference in medians. If we restrict the curves
to the point after they split (at four months), the LER is
noticeably higher (1.83).
The overall LED of 2.4 months may not seem striking because
it takes into account that many patients do not benefit before
four months. After four months, the LED is similar (2.3 months),
because it reflects a smaller area under the Kaplan-Meier
curve—that is, life expectancy (compared with the whole
follow-up period).
In scenarios like this, only some patients benefit (potentially a
minority). Investigators should examine the proportion of
patients who are at risk until the curves split and consider the

cost of treating them (with side effects) to be balanced against
the proportion who would (significantly) benefit.
Curves like this have been seen in cancer trials of
immunotherapy. In one such trial—pembrolizumab versus
chemotherapy for treating relapsed melanoma14—the HR was
0.57 (a strong relative effect) but the absolute improvement was
small, with a median PFS of 2.9 versus 2.7 months. The RMSTs
were 5.4 versus 3.6 months, producing an LED of 1.8 months
and LER of 1.5, which better reflect the overall treatment effect.
Discussion
Kaplan-Meier curves from RCTs exhibiting non-proportional
hazards are seen in the literature,10-16 but relatively few
investigators tackle this problem in their reports, and fewer still
take it into account when estimating treatment effects.
Non-proportionality could be caused by the mechanism of action
of a treatment, supported by biological evidence; a biomarker,
where the Kaplan-Meier curves do have proportional hazards
when analysed separately according to concentrations of the
marker2
; or treatments with long term benefits but high early
mortality. In other cases, it might simply be a chance finding
in a small trial or influenced by the trial design.
In some immunotherapy trials for advanced cancer, no difference
is seen in median PFS.1
 On closer inspection, the timing of the
first radiological assessment scan for progression coincides with
the median PFS, indicating that progression actually occurred
before this time in many patients; the timing of the first scan is
too late. Interpreting these results requires careful scrutiny,
regardless of the measure of treatment effect.
Our examples show that HRs and differences in median times
can be misleading when the curves do not have proportional
hazards. They can underestimate the absolute treatment benefit
(example 2) or overestimate the relative effect (example 3). In
these scenarios, LED and LER are more appropriate measures
of effect. Using survival (event) rates at a single time point
might avoid the problem of non-proportional hazards, but
because LED and LER are derived using the entire curves, they
give a more reliable estimate of treatment efficacy than one
based on a single time point, which is more likely to be
influenced by chance variability.
When the treatment effects clearly change over time (examples
2 and 3), no single “average” estimate of treatment efficacy can
effectively show this, whether using HR, LED, or LER.
Researchers should acknowledge the limitation of using overall
measures of effect. In such cases LED and LER can be estimated
for specific parts of the curves; for example, before and after
they cross over or after they separate. This is similar in principle
to splitting the time axis into several periods and estimating the
HR in each using a time dependent Cox regression model, but
LED and LER can be calculated for any shape of curve, even
within each time interval.
We recommend reporting two LED and LER estimates to
distinguish early from late treatment effects. Alternatively LED
and LER can be plotted according to follow-up time.
Researchers should try to understand and explain the biological
or mechanistic reasons behind such patterns (analogous to
exploring heterogeneity in meta-analyses). Specifying the time
periods before the trial begins is preferable, ideally those with
clinical relevance, to avoid focusing on parts of the curves where
the treatment effect happens to be the largest, although in our
examples the time points would not be known until the data are
visualised. LED and LER could be calculated at multiple time
points and corrected for multiple testing, which has recently
been proposed, though this may make the interpretation of a
trial more complex.9
 Finally, LED and LER can always be
estimated, even when the median times have not yet been
reached.
Recommendations
When HR changes with time, we recommend using LED and
LER as absolute and relative measures of treatment effect. These
measures are clinically meaningful and simple to understand.
When survival curves cross over, LED and LER can be
estimated for specific parts of the curves—for example, before
and after the curves cross over—to distinguish between early
and late treatment effects.
