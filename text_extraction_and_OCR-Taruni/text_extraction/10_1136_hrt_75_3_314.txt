Abstract


OBJECTIVES: To assess the current results and outcome of surgery
in infants and children with right atrial isomerism and complex
congenital heart disease. SETTING: Tertiary referral centre.
METHODS: 20 consecutive children with right atrial isomerism and
complex congenital heart disease underwent surgery over a 6 year
period between August 1987 and July 1993. The results and
outcome were analysed according to age, presentation, and surgical
procedures. RESULTS: Patients were divided into two groups
depending on age at presentation and initial surgery: group A
comprised 11 patients who required surgical intervention in the
first month of life (mean age 5 days); and group B comprised nine
patients who required initial surgical intervention after the first
month of life (mean age 6.8 months). Seven (64%) of the 11
patients in group A had obstructed pulmonary venous drainage and
ten (91%) had pulmonary atresia. There were seven early deaths
(64%), including the five patients who required systemic to
pulmonary artery shunt and simultaneous repair of obstructed
pulmonary veins. The long-term survival rate in this group was 18%
(two of 11). Pulmonary venous obstruction was present in two
(22%) of the nine patients in group B and four (44%) had
pulmonary atresia. There were no early deaths. One patient died
after a second palliative procedure. There was one late sudden
death. Four patients had a Fontan operation with no deaths. Two of
the remaining three patients meet the Fontan criteria. The long-
term survival rate in this group was 78% (seven of nine).
CONCLUSIONS: Surgical management of patients with right atrial
isomerism who have complex congenital heart disease carries a
high mortality and remains palliative. The overall survival rate was
45% (nine of 20); 18% in patients requiring surgery in the first
month of life (group A) and 78% in patients requiring surgery after
the first month of life (group B) (P < 0.001). Of the total of 20
patients, nine were potential candidates for a Fontan operation.
Seven of these have undergone a Fontan procedure with five
survivors.
