Abstract
Manometric examination of the oesophagus frequently reveals
abnormalities whose cause is unknown and whose physiological
importance is not clear. A large body of literature dealing with
oesophageal motility abnormalities has evolved over the past few
decades but comparisons among studies have been compromised by
the lack of a widely accepted system for classifying the abnormal
motility patterns, and by the lack of uniform diagnostic criteria for
the putative disorders. Based on an extensive review and analysis of
the literature, this report suggests an operational scheme to be used
for the general classification of oesophageal motility abnormalities,
and proposes standardised manometric criteria for the putative
oesophageal motility disorders. By applying the guidelines proposed
in this report, clinicians and researchers can determine if their
patients fulfil the manometric criteria for a putative motility
disorder. This should facilitate and improve comparisons among
patients and studies. However, it is important to emphasise that
fulfilment of the proposed criteria does not establish the clinical
importance of the motility abnormalities.
