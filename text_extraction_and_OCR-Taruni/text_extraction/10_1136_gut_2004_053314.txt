1.0 SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS
1.1 Genetics
N Clinical examination to exclude complex
cancer syndromes (for example, multiple
endocrine neoplasia 1 (MEN1)) should be
performed in all cases of neuroendocrine
tumours (NETs), and a family history taken
(grade C).
N In all cases where there is a family history of
carcinoids or NET, or a second endocrine
tumour, a familial syndrome should be
suspected (grade C).
N Individuals with sporadic or familial bronchial
or gastric carcinoid should have a family
history evaluation and consideration of test￾ing for germline MEN1 mutations. Manage￾ment of MEN1 families includes screening for
endocrine parathyroid and enteropancreatic
tumours from late childhood, with predictive
testing for first degree relatives of known
mutation carriers (grade C).
N All patients should be evaluated for second
endocrine tumours and possibly for other gut
cancers (grade C)
1.2 Diagnosis
If a patient presents with symptoms suspicious
of a gastroenteropancreatic NET:
N baseline tests should include chromogranin A
(CgA) and 5-hydroxy indole acetic acid (5-
HIAA) (grade C). Others that may be appro￾priate include thyroid function tests (TFTs),
parathyroid hormone (PTH), calcium, calcito￾nin, prolactin, a-fetoprotein, carcinoembryo￾nic antigen (CEA), and b-human chorionic
gonadotrophin (b-HCG) (grade D);
N specific biochemical tests should be requested
depending on which syndrome is suspected
(see table 4).
1.3 Imaging
N For detecting the primary tumour, a multi￾modality approach is best and may include
computed tomography (CT), magnetic reso￾nance imaging (MRI), somatostatin receptor
scintigraphy (SSRS), endoscopic ultrasound
(EUS), endoscopy, digital subtraction angio￾graphy (DSA), and venous sampling (grade
B/C).
N For assessing secondaries, SSRS is the most
sensitive modality (grade B).
N When a primary has been resected, SSRS may
be indicated for follow up1 (grade D).
1.4 Therapy
N The extent of the tumour, its metastases, and
secretory profile should be determined as far
as possible before planning treatment (grade
C).
N Surgery should be offered to patients who are
fit and have limited disease—that is, pri￾mary¡regional lymph nodes (grade C).
N Surgery should be considered in those with
liver metastases and potentially resectable
disease (grade D).
N Where abdominal surgery is undertaken and
long term treatment with somatostatin (SMS)
analogues is likely, cholecystectomy should be
considered.
N For patients who are not fit for surgery, the
aim of treatment is to improve and maintain
an optimal quality of life (grade D).
N The choice of treatment depends on the
symptoms, stage of disease, degree of uptake
of radionuclide, and histological features of
the tumour (grade C).
N Treatment choices for non-resectable disease
include SMS analogues, biotherapy, radio￾nuclides, ablation therapies, and chemother￾apy (grade C).
N External beam radiotherapy may relieve bone
pain from metastases (grade C).
N Chemotherapy may be used for inoperable or
metastatic pancreatic and bronchial tumours,
or poorly differentiated NETs (grade B).

Society of Gastroenterology, the Society for Endocrinology,
the Association of Surgeons of Great Britain and Ireland, as
well as its Surgical Specialty Associations, and the United
Kingdom Neuroendocrine Tumour Group (UKNET). Over the
past few years there have been advances in the management
of NETs, which have included clearer characterisation, more
specific and therapeutically relevant diagnosis, and improved
treatments. However, there are few randomised trials in the
field and the disease is uncommon; hence all evidence must
be considered weak in comparison with other commoner
cancers. It is our unanimous view that multidisciplinary
teams at referral centres should give guidance on the
definitive management of patients with gastroenteric and
pancreatic NETs with representation that should normally
include gastroenterologists, surgeons, oncologists, endocri￾nologists, radiologists, nuclear medicine specialists, and
histopathologists. The working party that produced these
guidelines included specialists from these various disciplines
contributing to the management of gastrointestinal NETs.
The purpose of these guidelines is to identify and inform the
key decisions to be made in the management of gastroentero￾pancreatic NETs, including carcinoid tumours. The guidelines
are not intended to be a rigid protocol but to form a basis
upon which to aim for improved standards in the quality of
treatment given to affected patients.
3.0 FORMULATION OF GUIDELINES
3.1 Literature search
A search of Medline was made using the key words carci￾noid tumour/malignant carcinoid syndrome/NETs/islet cell
tumours, and a total of 41 553 citations were found. This
search was updated every three months during the drafting
of these guidelines, in the following categories: diagnosis,
imaging, therapy, specific therapies, and prognosis.
3.2 Categories of evidence
The Oxford Centre for Evidence-based Medicine levels of
evidence (May 2001) were used to evaluate the evidence cited
in these guidelines.2
4.0 AETIOLOGY, EPIDEMIOLOGY, GENETICS, AND
CLINICAL FEATURES
4.1 Aetiology
The aetiology of NETs is poorly understood. Most are sporadic
but there is a small familial risk (see 4.4 Genetics). NETs
constitute a heterogeneous group of neoplasms which share
certain characteristic biological features, and therefore can be
considered as a common entity. They originate from
neuroendocrine cells, have secretory characteristics, and
may frequently present with hypersecretory syndromes.
Such tumours originate from pancreatic islet cells, gastro￾enteric tissue (from diffuse neuroendocrine cells distributed
throughout the gut), neuroendocrine cells within the
respiratory epithelium, and parafollicullar cells distributed
within the thyroid (the tumours being referred to as
medullary carcinomas of the thyroid). Pituitary, parathyroid,
and adrenomedullary neoplasms have certain common
characteristics with these tumours but are considered
separately. Gut derived NETs have been classified according
to their embryological origin into tumours of the foregut
(bronchi, stomach, pancreas, gall bladder, duodenum,),
midgut (jejunum, ileum, appendix, right colon), and hindgut
(left colon, rectum).3 These guidelines apply to carcinoid and
NETs arising from the gut, including the pancreas and liver
(gastroenteropancreatic), as well as those arising from the
lung that have metastasised to the liver or abdominal lymph
nodes. The term NET is to be encouraged as it is better
defined than carcinoid, although the latter is still in common
usage and usually denotes tumours secreting serotonin.
Apudoma as a term to describe these tumours has become
obsolete as it is non-specific. It is recommended that it is no
longer used in the management of this group of patients.
4.2 Epidemiology (tables 1, 2)
The incidence of NETs diagnosed during life is rising, with
gastrointestinal carcinoids making up the majority; earlier
estimates were of fewer than 2 per 100 000 per year4 but
more recent studies have found rates approaching 3 per
100 000, with a continuing slight predominance in women.5–7
The changes in incidence may result more from changes in
detection than in the underlying burden of disease as
thorough necropsy studies have demonstrated gastrointest￾inal NETs to be far commoner than expected from the
number of tumours identified in living patients.8 9 The risk of
NET in an individual with one affected first degree relative
has been estimated to be approximately four times that in the
general population; with two affected first degree relatives,
this risk has been estimated at over 12 times that in the
general population5 (see 4.4 Genetics). Recent data from over
13 000 NETs in the USA have shown that approximately 20%
of patients with these tumours develop other cancers, one
third of which arise in the gastrointestinal tract. Recent
increases in the survival of individuals with NET have been
documented10 although overall five year survival of all NET
cases in the largest series to date was 67.2%.11
Meticulous post mortem studies have identified pancreatic
NETs in up to 10% of individuals12 but the incidence of

pancreatic NETs in life is far lower. This would predict an
incidence far greater than that seen in life which has been
assessed in population based studies as being 0.2–0.4 per
100 000 per year, with insulinoma and gastrinoma as the
commonest among this rare group of tumours.
Because many NETs are slow growing or of uncertain
malignant potential, and even malignant NETs are associated
with prolonged survival, prevalence is relatively high.13
4.3 Clinical features
Primary gastroenteropancreatic tumours can be asympto￾matic but may present with obstructive symptoms (pain,
nausea, and vomiting) despite normal radiology. The
syndromes described below are typically seen in patients
with secretory tumours. The carcinoid syndrome is usually a
result of metastases to the liver with the subsequent release
of hormones (serotonin, tachykinins, and other vasoactive
compounds) directly into the systemic circulation.14 This
syndrome is characterised by flushing and diarrhoea. Some
patients have lacrymation, rhinorrhoea, and episodic palpita￾tions when they flush. At the time of diagnosis in patients
with the syndrome approximately 70% give a history of
intermittent abdominal pain, 50% a history of diarrhoea, and
about 30% a history of flushing. Less commonly wheezing
and pellagra may occur as presenting features, with carcinoid
heart disease typically not occurring unless the syndrome
has been present for some years.15 16 Occasionally, similar
syndromes can occur when there are no measurable
hormones detected in blood or urine.
Patients with bronchial carcinoid present with evidence
of bronchial obstruction (41%)—obstructive pneumonitis,
pleuritic pain, atelectasis, difficulty with breathing; cough
(35%) and haemoptysis (23%)—while 15% present with a
variety of other symptoms, including weakness, nausea,
weight loss, night sweats, neuralgia, and Cushing’s syn￾drome.17 Up to 30% are asymptomatic.
The carcinoid crisis is characterised by profound flushing,
bronchospasm, tachycardia, and widely and rapidly fluctuat￾ing blood pressure. It is thought to be due to the release of
mediators which lead to the production of high levels of
serotonin and other vasoactive peptides. It is usually
precipitated by anaesthetic induction for any operation,
intraoperative handling of the tumour, or other invasive
therapeutic procedures such as embolisation and radio￾frequency ablation.
Syndromes related to pancreatic NETs and their principal
clinical features18 19 are shown in table 3.
4.4 Genetics
NETs may occur as part of complex familial endocrine cancer
syndromes such as multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1
(MEN1), multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2),20
neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1),21 22 Von Hippel Lindau, and
Carney’s complex although the majority occur as non￾familial (that is, sporadic) isolated tumours. The incidence
of MEN1 in gastroenteropancreatic NETs varies from
virtually 0% in gut carcinoids to 5% in insulinomas to 25–
30% in gastrinomas (see table 2).18 However, it is important
to search thoroughly for MEN1, MEN2, and NF1 in all
patients with NETs by obtaining a detailed family history,
clinical examination, and appropriate biochemical and
radiological investigations. The diagnosis can also now be
confirmed by genetic testing. A diagnosis of MEN1, MEN2,

Recommendations (genetics)
N Clinical examination to exclude complex cancer
syndromes (for example, MEN1) should be performed
in all cases of NETs, and a family history taken (grade
C).
N In all cases where there is a family history of carcinoids
or NET, or a second endocrine tumour, a familial
syndrome should be suspected (grade C).
N Individuals with sporadic or familial bronchial or
gastric carcinoid should have family history evaluation
and consideration of testing for germline MEN1
mutations. Management of MEN1 families includes
screening for endocrine parathyroid and enteropan￾creatic tumours from late childhood, with predictive
testing for first degree relatives of known mutation
carriers (grade C).
N All patients should be evaluated for second endocrine
tumours and possibly for other gut cancers (grade C).

and NF1 not only has important implications for the patient
but also for the patient’s relatives who should be considered
for screening for the associated tumours and for genetic
testing.
Most NETs are sporadic but epidemiological studies show a
small increased familial risk, with standardised incidence
ratios of 4.35 (n = 4, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.86–7.89)
for small intestinal and 4.65 (n = 4, 95% CI 1.21–10.32) for
colon NETs in the offspring of parents affected with
carcinoids. This familial clustering was seen to be more
pronounced with midgut and hindgut tumours, and few
patients had obvious MEN1, suggesting that much of this
association is independent of MEN1.6 Risks for second
cancers, in males, were increased during the first year of
follow up. Slightly lower risks were noted in females
5.0 DIAGNOSIS
Gastroenteropancreatic NETs may produce specific symptoms
and hormones. The diagnosis is therefore based on clinical
symptoms, hormone concentration, radiological and nuclear
medicine imaging, and histological confirmation. The gold
standard in diagnosis is detailed histology and this should be
obtained whenever possible.
5.1 Blood and urine measurements
For symptomatic patients with hormone secreting tumours
there are a variety of generalised and specific biochemical
tests used in the investigation of these tumours such as
calcium, TFTs, PTH (if low measure parathyroid hormone
related protein), calcitonin, prolactin, a-fetoprotein, CEA,
and b-HCG. Measurement of circulating peptides and amines
in patients with NETs is helpful on three counts.
(1) It assists in making the initial diagnosis.
(2) It is helpful in the assessment of treatment.
(3) It may offer prognostic information.
Plasma chromogranin A (CgA)23–24 may be useful in
diagnosis, particularly in gastric carcinoids with metastases,
but it is unclear how accurate this is in monitoring
progression of disease. Other markers such as serum
pancreatic polypeptide, serum calcitonin, and serum HCG
(a and b) may indicate neuroendocrine disease. CgA is a large
protein which is produced by all cells deriving from the
neural crest.26 27 The function of CgA is not known but it
is produced in very significant quantities by NET cells
regardless of their secretory status. Pancreatic polypeptide is
produced by normal pancreas but is found in high
concentrations in 80% of patients with pancreatic tumours
and also in 50% of patients with carcinoid tumours.16
Certain foods and drugs will affect urinary excretion of
5-HIAA if they are taken just before collection of the urine
sample. Banana, avocado, aubergine, pineapple, plums,
walnut, paracetamol, fluorouracil, methysergide, naproxen,
and caffeine may cause false positive results. Levodopa,
aspirin, adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH), methyldopa,
and phenothiazines may give a false negative result. Serum
5-hydroxytryptamine concentrations vary with time of day
and meals and are not currently used clinically.
Peptide markers for gastroenteropancreatic NETs are
presently measured in two laboratories in the UK—The
Regional Regulatory Peptide Laboratory, Royal Victoria Hospi￾tal, Belfast, and the Peptide Laboratory, Hammersmith
Hospital, London. Blood samples can be sent through local
laboratories.
The presence of symptoms, liver metastases, and a positive
humoral test is highly suggestive of an NET but histology is
usually necessary for confirmation and will allow prolifera￾tion indices to be assessed, which may influence manage￾ment. If histology is available from a previous primary site,
biopsy of the secondaries may not be necessary.
6.0 IMAGING
The optimum imaging modality depends on whether it is to
be used in detecting disease in a patient suspected of an NET
or for assessing the extent of disease in a known case.
Table 4 Additional specific biochemical tests used in the diagnosis of neuroendocrine tumours (NETs)16 26–30

Midgut 24 h urinary 5-HIAA Usually raised (70% of patients)
Tachykinins (neurokinin A and B) Raised
Hindgut 24 h urinary 5-HIAA Not raised (general markers used instead)
Other NETs
Gastrinoma Fasting gastrin, gastric secretion studies Raised basal serum gastrin, high gastric acid secretion

VIPoma Fasting gut hormones Raised fasting vasointestinal peptide
Ppoma Fasting gut hormones Raised fasting pancreatic polypeptide
Somatostatinoma Fasting gut hormones Raised fasting somatostatin
All NETs Serum chromogranin Raised chromogranin A in most cases23–25
Ectopic hormones GHRH, ACTH, HCG-a and -b Raised but incidence very low
5-HIAA, 5-hydroxy indole acetic acid; GHRH, gonadotrophin releasing hormone; ACTH, adrenocorticotrophic hormone; b-HCG, b-human chorionic
gonadotrophin.
Currently in the UK, the following are the hormones normally performed when gut hormones are requested: gastrin, glucagon, somatostatin, pancreatic
polypeptide, vasointestinal peptide, and neurotensin. Chromogranin A will be performed on the same sample when requested. Blood is taken in a 10 ml standard
heparin bottle with trasylol (aprotinin 0.2 ml, 2000 KIU) and spun immediately before being frozen and sent to one of the reference laboratories.
Recommendations (diagnosis)
If a patient presents with symptoms suspicious of a
gastroenteropancreatic NET:
N Baseline tests should include CgA and 5-HIAA (grade
C). Others that may be appropriate include TFTs, PTH,
calcium, calcitonin, prolactin, a-fetoprotein, CEA, and
b-HCG (grade D).
N Specific biochemical tests should be requested depend￾ing on which syndrome is suspected (table 4).

6.1. Imaging in suspected NET/carcinoids
Gastric, duodenal, chest, and colonic primary sites are easier
to find as they are likely to be shown at endoscopy or CT
scanning as appropriate. A primary midgut NET may not be
seen on imaging and thus a patient with abdominal pain and
change in bowel habit over many years is often labelled as
having irritable bowel syndrome. Barium series and CT scans
may be normal but will show larger lesions (fixation,
separation, thickening, and angulation, and often calcifica￾tion at the centre of a ‘‘starburst’’ appearance of the
desmoplastic reaction). SSRS (octreoscan) and mesenteric
angiography may be useful but are not practical in all cases
with these symptoms.
Pancreatic NETs with no syndrome are usually detected
late in the course of the disease and seen on CT, MRI, or
SSRS. Functioning pancreatic NETs may be identified earlier
and the potential for surgical cure necessitates accurate
localisation which may be performed using CT, MRI, EUS,
often together with SSRS, and in some centres DSA with
intra-arterial calcium stimulation.
6.2 Imaging for detecting the primary tumour when
the patient has already presented with metastases
Many patients present with metastatic disease with no
known primary site. Investigations for localising the primary
site may include (depending on the type of tumour and
symptoms): ultrasound scans of the abdomen, testes, and
ovaries; EUS; CT scan of the chest (bronchial carcinoid),
abdomen, and pelvis; endoscopy-colonoscopy and gastro￾scopy; barium studies; and nuclear medicine functional
imaging. In one series, primary tumours were localised in
81–96% of cases using radiological and/or nuclear medicine
imaging.32 Opinion is divided on whether locating the
primary changes prognosis. EUS is a major diagnostic
investigation in a patient with a suspected pancreatic NET.
Its sensitivity may be less with extrapancreatic gastrinomas
(80% of gastrinomas in MEN1 are found in the duodenum)
for which an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and CT or MRI
should be performed first.33 34
Neuroendocrine tumours express somatostatin receptors
(SSTR) and this has led to the development of radiolabelled
somatostatin analogues for diagnostic imaging. There are five
receptor subtypes, of which 2 and 5 are currently the only two
SSTRs that can be readily detected. With the exception of
insulinomas (50% of tumours express SSTR2), SSRS plays a
central role in locating and assessing the primary in
gastroenteropancreatic NETs.35–37 For foregut, midgut, and
hindgut tumours, a sensitivity of up to 90% has been noted
with SSRS. The sensitivity could be further enhanced by the
use of single positron emission computed tomography and
fusion imaging with CT.38–40 However, in patients whose
octreoscan is negative and in whom no diagnosis is reached
after upper and lower gastrointestinal endoscopy, a triple
phase CT scan of the thorax and abdomen is regarded as the
investigation of choice.
A CT scan is the best modality for localising lung lesions
but this could be followed by SSRS to assess the full extent of
the disease.
Intra-arterial calcium with digital subtraction angiography
may be particularly important for localising gastrinomas.41 42
Intra-arterial calcium stimulation combined with hepatic
venous sampling for insulin gradients has been reported to
achieve up to 90% success rate in localising insulinomas.
The sensitivity is further increased by combining it with
imaging modalities such as intraoperative ultrasonography
(table 5).43 44
6.3 Searching for secondaries
The diagnostic test of choice to locate secondaries is SSRS.59
This applies also to insulinomas as it is believed that
secondary insulinomas may show positive SSTR more often
than the primary. The sensitivity of SSRS for detecting
metastases is 61–96%.1 47 49 50 60–63 Demonstration of SSTR
status by 111In octreotide imaging positively predicts response
to somatostatin analogue therapy. The role of 123I-MIBG is
limited to identifying patients that will be suitable for MIBG
therapy and the sensitivity of MIBG imaging for metastases is
only up to 50%.61 64 MIBG or SSRS will identify patients with
inoperable or metastatic disease who might be candidates for
high dose targeted radiotherapy. SSRS prior to surgery
revised the staging and changed management in 33% in
Krenning’s series.35
6.4 Monitoring progression of disease
Spiral CT scanning, MRI, and ultrasound scans are useful for
monitoring lesions.65 66 Urinary 5-HIAA levels do not accu￾rately correlate with disease progression and response to
treatment. CgA has been reported to be a sensitive marker
which may correlate with response and relapse,26 27 with fast
rising levels correlating with poor prognosis,25 although
further data are needed to confirm if it correlates with
survival.

7.0 ASSESSMENT OF QUALITY OF LIFE
Metastatic disease is a common presentation in patients with
NETs; therefore, the aim of treatment is frequently improve￾ment of their quality of life rather than cure. A specific
quality of life score is being developed. For now the best tool
is the EORTC QLQ C-30,67and it is recommended that quality
of life should be assessed regularly throughout treatment.
8.0 PATHOLOGY
8.1 Pathological reporting of enteropancreatic NETs
Pathologists dealing with these tumours should have a
special interest in endocrine or gastrointestinal pathology or
participate in a network with the opportunity of pathology
review. Tumours should be classified according to the recent
WHO classification.68–70 This places all enteropancreatic NETs
into one of four categories, based on a combination of gross
and histological features (see table 6 in the appendix).
(1) Well differentiated endocrine tumour of probable benign
behaviour.
(2) Well differentiated endocrine tumour of uncertain
behaviour.
(3) Well differentiated endocrine carcinoma.
(4) Poorly differentiated endocrine carcinoma.
There is currently no TNM staging system for these
tumours.
8.2 Specimen handling
Details of the protocols for specimen handling and histol￾ogical analysis are given in the appendix. General points are
outlined below.
When the diagnosis of NET has been made or is suspected
preoperatively and specimens are to be used for research,
informed consent should be sought from the patient. The
resection specimen should, where possible, be placed on ice
immediately after removal and brought fresh to the
pathology laboratory.
A standard protocol should be followed for assessment of
the specimen based, where appropriate, on those produced
for the Royal College of Pathologists (RCPath) for cancers at
the sites,71–73 and those published by the Cancer Committee of
the College of American Pathologists.74
Where possible, frozen tissue should be stored in addition
to standard formalin fixed paraffin blocks. The endocrine
nature of the tumour should be confirmed by immuno￾histochemistry, using a panel of antibodies to general neuro￾endocrine markers. Where a syndrome of hormone excess is
present, the tumour can also be confirmed as the source
using antibodies to the specific hormone(s). Details of these
and prognostic features such as proliferation index are
discussed in the appendix.
9.0 TREATMENT
9.1 Objectives
The aim of treatment should be curative where possible but is
palliative in the majority of cases. These patients often
maintain a good quality of life for a long period despite
having metastases. Although the rate of growth and
malignancy are variable, the aim should always be to
maintain a good quality of life for as long as possible. For
those patients who are diagnosed early with limited and
operable disease, the aim is to keep the patient disease and
symptom free for as long as possible.
9.2 Surgery
In this section, tumours of the luminal gastrointestinal tract
will be referred to as carcinoids as this is in common usage,
and references usually refer to this term in surgical journals
to date.
9.2.1 General approach
This is the only curative treatment for NETs. As with all
gastrointestinal tumours, conduct of surgery with intent to
cure is dependent on the method of presentation and stage of
disease. Specific issues in carcinoid patients include deter￾mining the extent of local and distant tumour, identification
of synchronous non-carcinoid tumours, recognition of fluid
and electrolyte depletion from diarrhoea, and in advanced
cases, detection of less obvious cases of carcinoid syndrome
as well as detection of cardiac abnormalities. The treatment
plan should be modified accordingly, whether to meet
immediate or long term objectives, within a multidisciplinary
framework. With carcinoid, if the primary lesion is less than
2 cm in diameter, the incidence of metastasis is low.78
However, nodal or liver metastases are present at the
presentation of carcinoid tumours in 40–70% of patients32 75–78
(see also table 1).
9.2.2 Prevention of carcinoid crises
When a functioning carcinoid tumour is found before
surgery, a potential carcinoid crisis should be prevented by
prophylactic administration of octreotide, given by constant
intravenous infusion at a dose of 50 mg/h for 12 hours prior to
and at least 48 hours after surgery.79–81 It is also important to
avoid drugs that release histamine or activate the sympa￾thetic nervous system.82 Despite octreotide therapy, patients
may still develop life threatening cardiorespiratory complica￾tions that can tax even the most experienced anaesthetist,
who may have to use alpha and beta blocking drugs to avoid
severe complications.83
Similar prophylactic measures may be required for
pancreatic and periampullary NETs (for example, glucose
infusion for insulinoma, proton pump inhibitor (oral or
infusion), and intravenous octreotide for gastrinoma).
9.2.3 Lung
The treatment of choice is a major lung resection or wedge
resection plus node dissection; five year survival after such
surgery is 67–96% depending on the histology of the
tumour.84–87
9.2.4 Emergency abdominal presentations
Those patients presenting with suspected appendicitis,
intestinal obstruction, or other gastrointestinal emergencies
are likely to require resections sufficient to correct the
immediate problem. Once definitive histopathology is
obtained, a further more radical resection may have to be
considered. The commonest circumstance is when a carcinoid
of the appendix has been removed which is 2 cm or more in
diameter. Under these circumstances a right hemicolectomy
is usually indicated, despite the frequent absence of obvious
malignant features characterising the carcinoid tumour.88–90
Tumours 1–2 cm or invading the serosal surface may require
further resection, particularly if atypical with goblet cell or
adenocarcinoid features,91 or if it is located at the base of the
appendix, or if histology shows mesoappendiceal and/or
vascular invasion, when a right hemicolectomy with loco￾regional lymphadenectomy should be considered. Whether or
not this is performed, the patient should be followed up for
five years. If the lesion is less than 1 cm in diameter, even if
there is extension to the serosa, provided complete resection
by appendicectomy has been undertaken, this procedure is so
likely to be curative that a further resection should not
normally be considered, nor would extended follow up
appear necessary. In the case of small bowel tumours, a
limited emergency small bowel resection for an obstructing
carcinoid tumour can be followed at a later date by elective

surgery to remove further small bowel. This is particularly
appropriate if by then a second tumour has been identified,
or to undertake mesenteric lymphadenectomy. A substantial
minority of patients with midgut carcinoid have multiple
tumours,92 93 so a search should be made following removal of
an obstructing lesion prior to any further surgery.
9.2.5 Stomach
In patients with gastric carcinoid the approach depends on
the type of tumour of which there are three types. Type 1
gastric carcinoids are associated with hypergastrinaemia and
chronic atrophic gastritis, originate from enterochromaffin￾like cells, and can synthesise and store histamine. The
frequency of metastasis is low, and in many cases surveil￾lance only is appropriate,24 94 although limited surgery with
endoscopic polypectomy and/or antrectomy may be prefer￾able.24 95–97 Type 2 gastric carcinoids occur in patients with
hypergastrinaemia due to Zollinger-Ellison syndrome in
combination with MEN type1.98 Type 3 gastric carcinoids
are sporadic and have a more malignant course.94 99 They are
not associated with hypergastrinaemia. These tumours have
often metastasised by the time of diagnosis. Small tumours
less than 1 cm with no extension into muscle on EUS or CT
could be resected endoscopically but most lesions will need
resection and clearance of regional lymph nodes.24
9.2.6 Small intestinal carcinoid
By far the great majority of small intestinal carcinoids are
malignant in nature. Whether liver metastases are present or
not, resection of the primary and extensive resection of
associated mesenteric lymph nodes is appropriate, to remove
tumour for cure or to delay progression that would otherwise
endanger the small bowel. Nodal metastases cause sclerosis
with vascular compromise of the associated small bowel,
which can lead to pain, malabsorption, and even death.
Patients, who only after laparotomy and histological exam￾ination are discovered to have small intestinal carcinoid, may
be candidates for further surgery, notably for extensive
mesenteric lymphadenectomy. Resection of mesenteric
metastases may alleviate symptoms dramatically, and poss￾ibly prolong survival.
9.2.7 Colorectum
Standard resection with locoregional lymphadenectomy is
appropriate. Clearance of metastatic lymph nodes is a
worthwhile objective that may contribute to long term
survival, and nodal clearance does not add significantly to
the risk of surgery, which should in any case be ,2% when
conducted by specialist colorectal teams. Small lesions less
than 1 cm in diameter may be considered adequately treated
by complete endoscopic removal but the patient will require
follow up endoscopy to ensure this has been accomplished.
9.2.8 Pancreas
Pancreatic and periampullary NETs form a special group that
requires particular consideration. As with all other neoplasms
at these sites, surgery should only be undertaken in specialist
hepatopancreatobiliary units. Often the diagnosis is estab￾lished biochemically prior to surgery, and although pre￾operative localisation can be difficult, the biochemical
diagnosis provides some indication of the site of the tumour
(for example, the gastrinoma triangle) and the likelihood of
malignancy (for example, low with insulinoma). Thus for
insulinoma, if the lesion is clearly localised before surgery,
and is near or at the surface of the pancreas and easily
defined at surgery, enucleation may be sufficient, provided
histopathology demonstrates complete excision and benign
features. However, this may not be possible and Kausch￾Whipple pancreatoduodenectomy, left pancreatectomy, or
even total pancreatectomy may be justified in selected cases.
These operations are also applied to selected cases with
localised disease arising from other functioning, as well as
non-functioning, NETs of the pancreas.100 In patients with
the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome that do not have MEN1,
surgical exploration should be offered for a possible cure of
the disease. There is controversy concerning those patients
with this syndrome who have MEN1 however, as older data
suggest poorer survival in patients treated surgically.
Nevertheless, the majority of these patients die from
malignant spread of their gastrinomas, suggesting that
resection is preferable at a suitable stage to prevent
metastatic spread.
9.2.9 Liver
In the presence of liver metastases, ‘‘curative’’ liver resection
is possible in approximately 10% of cases if the lesion(s) is
(are) confined to one lobe. With bilobar metastases and one
very dominant lesion causing symptoms, a debulking
operation may be carried out for palliation, particularly if
there is resistance to medical therapy. The five year survival
after resection of the primary and/or liver secondary is up to
87% and postoperative mortality is 6%.101–105 Several series
have shown low morbidity and excellent medium term
survival after liver resection with worse outcomes in other
patients not resected,104 106 107 but this may partly reflect stage
of disease. A minority of patients with no obvious primary
may have primary hepatic neuroendocrine malignancy and
surgery can be curative108; for such patients, surgery is the
treatment of choice, with a recurrence rate of 18% and five
year survival of 74% reported in one series.109 Many patients
will need somatostatin analogues which predispose patients
to gall stones, hence the gall bladder is usually removed at
the time of liver surgery.
9.3 Liver transplantation
Patients with end stage carcinoid disease and uncontrollable
symptoms that are unresponsive to any other therapy have
been considered for liver transplantation.110–116
All UK transplants for NET/carcinoid have recently been
analysed117 and actuarial disease free survival was 62% at one
year and 23% at five years, with similar data in a series from
France.118 These series both include patients from many years
ago where survival rates would be expected to be lower and
many patients in these series predate modern imaging
techniques. The data bring into question whether orthotopic
liver transplantation should be considered at all for this
disease. At present, the organ shortage combined with the
low survival data suggest this should not be used in general
but might be considered in exceptional circumstances.
Further research is needed to try to assess pretransplant
prognostic factors.
9.4 Symptomatic treatment
There are a number of treatment options available for
patients displaying symptoms due to hormones/peptides
secreted by a secretory tumour. These include somatostatin
analogues, proton pump inhibitors for gastrinomas, and
diazoxide for insulinomas, which are indicated in patients
with secretory tumours and distressing symptoms from
peptide production. They could be commenced immediately
in patients with inoperable disease or preoperatively in
patients who have operable disease (liver resection with or
without resection of the primary).
The only proven hormonal management of NETs is
administration of somastostatin analogues. Somatostatin is
a brain-gut peptide that inhibits the release of many
hormones and can impair some exocrine functions.
Somatostatin receptors are present in the vast majority (70–
95%) of NETs but only in about half of insulinomas, and less
in poorly differentiated NETs and somatostatinoma.

Somatostatin analogues bind principally to receptor subtypes
2 and 5.119
Somatostatin analogues inhibit the release of various
peptide hormones in the gut, pancreas, and pituitary,
antagonise growth factor effects on tumour cells, and at very
high dosage may induce apoptosis. The elimination half life
of the natural hormone somatostatin is only a few minutes,
making it of no value in routine therapy. Octreotide has a half
life of several hours, making intermittent therapy possible.
This drug is administered by subcutaneous injection starting
at 50–100 mg twice or three times a day to a maximum daily
dose of 1500 mg.120 More recently, analogues with sustained
release from depot injections have been synthesised and
these are given every 2–4 weeks.121 These drugs, lanreotide
(fortnightly injection), Sandostatin LAR (monthly), and
Lanreotide Autogel (also monthly), have shown significant
improvement in the quality of life of patients and have as
good or better efficacy compared with short acting octreo￾tide.121–123 Patients may be stabilised with octreotide (short
acting) for 10–28 days before converting them to long acting
somatostatin analogues. Escalation of dose is often needed
over time. Biochemical response rates (inhibition of hormone
production) are seen in 30–70% of patients with symptomatic
control in the majority of patients; tumour growth may
stabilise and rarely shrinkage of tumour may occur.123–129 In
instances of stress (for example, anaesthesia, surgical
operations (see above), hepatic artery embolisation), patients
with the carcinoid syndrome or even with the tumour but
without syndrome should have increased coverage by
somatostatin analogues, preferably short acting octreotide
by intravenous administration (50 mg/h). This extra cover
should be administered 12 hours before, during, and
48 hours after the procedure to prevent a cardiovascular
carcinoid crises.79
Few side effects from somatostatin analogues have been
reported130–132 and they include fat malabsorption, gall stones
and gall bladder dysfunction, vitamin A and D malabsorp￾tion, headaches, diarrhoea, dizziness, and hypo- and hyper￾glycaemia. Monitoring of circulating and, where relevant,
urinary hormone levels should be undertaken during periods
of treatment. Patients should also have the regular relevant
imaging.
9.5 Efficacy of drugs in the various syndromes
In those with midgut and lung carcinoid syndromes,
although hormone levels are not normalised during treat￾ment there is substantial relief of the main symptoms of
flushing and diarrhoea in the majority of patients.121 133 There
may an indication for a trial of these drugs in patients
without a secretory syndrome. There may also be long term
prevention of the advancement of carcinoid heart disease and
intestinal fibrosis, although studies are conflicting.
9.5.1 VIPomas (watery diarrhoea hypokalaemia
achlorhydria (WDHA) syndrome/Werner-Morrison
syndrome)
Rehydration is always indicated and may improve the clinical
condition considerably. Patients with this rare life threaten￾ing syndrome frequently respond dramatically to small doses
of somatostatin analogues with cessation of diarrhoea.134 The
dose of the drug may be titrated against vasoactive intestinal
peptide levels with normalisation of levels being the target.
9.5.2 Glucagonomas
Improvement by somatostatin analogues has been reported
in patients with the syndrome although there is no indication
for the drugs if the patient has no syndrome. It is unlikely
that circulating glucagons levels can be normalised as these
patients frequently have massive amounts of circulating
glucagon. The characteristic rash of necrolytic migratory
erythema can be life threatening.
9.5.3 Gastrinomas
The syndrome is adequately controlled with high dose proton
pump inhibitor drugs and there is no definite added benefit
in the control of symptoms by addition of somatostatin
analogues. However, some groups advise the addition of
somatostatin analogues.
9.5.4 Insulinomas
Only 50% of insulinomas have type II somatostatin receptors.
Diazoxide has been shown to be effective in controlling
hypoglycaemic symptoms in patients with insulinoma.135 Side
effects (fluid retention and hirsutism) are common but not
troublesome. This treatment therefore should be considered
in patients not cured by surgery or unsuitable for surgery.
Administration of somatostatin analogues has variable
effects on blood glucose levels, possibly also acting by
suppression of counterregulatory hormones such as gluca￾gon. Glucose infusion and glucagon intramuscularly can be
added to achieve immediate effect.
9.6 Other drugs
Ondansetron has been used for general symptom control in
the carcinoid syndrome and can be useful. Cyproheptadine is
still occasionally used for carcinoid syndrome. Pancreatic
enzyme supplements or cholestyramine are often used to
control diarrhoea, which may be especially troublesome after
intestinal resection. Pancreatic insufficiency can also occur
with octreotide/lanreotide therapy.
In glucagonoma patients, zinc therapy can be used to
prevent further skin lesions, and anticoagulation (for the
high incidence of thrombosis) is used for patients with this
tumour. Steroids can be used in urgent situations for
insulinoma patients.
9.7 Interferon-alpha
This is used both in secreting carcinoid tumours and other
NETs on its own or added to long acting somatostatin
analogues if the patient is not responding to the maximum
dosage of somatostatin analogues. Interferon-alpha 3–5 MU
3–5 times per week subcutaneously is the usual dose
employed. However, there is conflicting evidence as to its
efficacy, with only one major group supporting its wide￾spread use and there is some evidence it may have greater
effect in tumours with low mitotic rate. There has been
biochemical response in 40–60% of patients, symptomatic
improvement in 40–70% of patients, and significant tumour
shrinkage in a median of 10–15% of patients.136–138 In
combination with somatostatin analogues, the effect may
be enhanced.139–141
9.8 Chemotherapy
The role of chemotherapy for NETs is uncertain but is being
actively researched. It is essential to consider the tumour
types individually in view of their varying response to
chemotherapy and the indications to use it. Certain prog￾nostic factors may also help in determining the use of
chemotherapy and one paper showed an inverse correlation
between imaging with SSRS radioscintigraphy and response
to treatment. Response to chemotherapy in patients with
strongly positive carcinoid tumours was of the order of only
10% whereas patients with SSRS negative tumours had a
response rate in excess of 70%.142 The highest response rates
with chemotherapy are seen in the poorly differentiated and
anaplastic NETs: response rates of 70% or more have been
seen with cisplatin and etoposide based combinations.143 144
These responses may be relatively short lasting in the order of
only 8–10 months.142 Response rates for pancreatic islet cell

tumours vary between 40% and 70% and usually involve
combinations of streptozotocin (or lomustine), dacarbazine,
5-fluorouracil, and adriamycin.145 146 However, the best results
have been seen from the Mayo clinic where up to 70%
response rates with remissions lasting several years have
been seen by combining chemoembolisation of the hepatic
artery with chemotherapy.147 The use of chemotherapy for
midgut carcinoids has a much lower response rate, with
15–30% of patients deriving benefit, which may only last
6–8 months. Again, the most commonly used agents will be
those listed above. The management of pulmonary carcinoids
is more likely to involve a platinum and etoposide combina￾tion and may reflect the fact that a pulmonary oncologist will
be involved and that bronchial carcinoids may represent one
end of the spectrum, which includes small cell lung cancer,
which is exquisitely chemosensitive. If possible, patients
should be entered into formal trials of new agents (see 9.13
emerging therapies below).
9.9 Targeted radionuclide therapy
This is a useful palliative option for symptomatic patients
with inoperable or metastatic tumour.
The principle of treatment is only to give radionuclide
therapy when there is abnormally increased uptake of the
corresponding imaging agent. No randomised controlled
trials have been performed. The gamma emitting imag￾ing radionuclide is replaced by a beta imaging therapy
radionuclide: 131I-MIBG for 123I-MIBG, 90Y-octreotide for 111In-octreotate, and 90Y-lanreotide for 111In-lanreotide.148
Treatment indications include evidence of avid uptake of
123I-MIBG or 111In octreotide at all known tumour sites on
diagnostic imaging. Contraindications include pregnancy and
breast feeding, myelosuppression, and renal failure (glomer￾ular filtration rate ,40 ml/min). Patients should be continent
and self caring to minimise risk to nursing staff.149
9.9.1 131I-MIBG Therapy
Treatment protocols vary between different centres. For
radiation protection reasons, 131I-MIBG therapies necessitate
admission to a dedicated isolation facility. Potassium iodide/
iodate thyroid blockade is given pretreatment to prevent
thyroidal uptake of free radioiodine. The usual prescribed
activities in the UK range between 7.4 and 11.2 GBq
administered at 3–6 month intervals. MIBG therapy is the
only licensed radionuclide therapy for NETs. Symptom
control is up to 80% and a five year survival rate of 60%
has been recorded.150 151 Treatment is well tolerated and
toxicity limited to temporary myelosuppression 4–6 weeks
post therapy.152 This will be more severe in patients who have
bone marrow infiltration by tumour at the time of treatment
or who have undergone previous chemotherapy or targeted
therapy. Myelosuppression is cumulative and may be dose
limiting after repeated treatment cycles.
9.9.2 90Y-octreotide therapy
Experience using 90Y-DOTATOC is growing although it is not
widely available at present. Usual cumulative activities range
from 12 to 18 GBq administered in 3–6 GBq fractions at
6–8 week intervals. Most patients report subjective benefit
within two treatment cycles, often associated with reduction
in biochemical tumour markers. The majority of patients
achieve tumour stabilisation although significant tumour
regression is unusual (approximately 20% of treated
patients).153–159 Toxicity includes myelosuppression, particu￾larly lymphopenia, and nephrotoxicity.160 161 Pretreatment
with amino acids, particularly D-lysine, reduce tubular octreo￾tide binding and is essential to minimise renal damage.162
Clinical trials using 90Y-DOTATOC are in progress.163
9.9.3 90Y-lanreotide therapy
Experience with 90Y-lanreotide therapy is limited but it is
clear that the range of tumours taking up 111In-lanreotide
differs from those taking up 111In-octreotide, and therefore 111In-lanreotide imaging is required to select patients for 90Y-lanreotide therapy. The results of the trial in 154 patients
showed stable disease in 41% and regression in 14%.164
9.10 Embolisation of hepatic artery
This procedure is indicated for patients with non-resectable
multiple and hormone secreting tumours with the intention
of reducing tumour size and hormone output. Arterial
embolisation induces ischaemia of the tumour cells, thereby
reducing their hormone output and causing liquefaction.
Ischaemia of tumour cells also increases their sensitivity to
chemotherapeutic substances and this underlies the principle
of chemoembolisation. There are two types of embolisation:
particle and chemoembolisation. Particles used include
polyvinyl alcohol and gel foam powder. For chemoemboli￾sation, agents such as doxorubicin and cisplatin are
used primarily.165 Contraindications for chemoembolisation
include complete portal vein obstruction, liver insufficiency,
and biliary reconstruction.
The overall five year survival post embolisation is 50–60%.
Symptomatic response to this treatment is 40–80% and
biochemical response is 50–60%. Mortality overall is 4–6%
and adverse events have been reported in 10–17% of cases
post embolisation.165–170 Only one lobe should be embolised
per session and the patency of the portal vein must be
confirmed before the procedure is undertaken. Post emboli￾sation syndrome (nausea, fever, and abdominal pain) is the
commonest side effect. Hormone therapy should be used
prior to all embolisations: 50–100 mg octreotide per hour
intravenously for 12 hours prior (or bolus two hours before
plus infusion) and 48 hours post procedure. Some units use
hydrocortisone 100 mg intravenously and prophylactic anti￾biotics prior to the procedure, and pre-dosing with allopur￾inol to prevent a tumour lysis syndrome.
9.11 Ablation therapies
9.11.1 Radiofrequency ablation
This has been used with some effect in stabilising or reducing
tumour size but randomised trials are lacking. It may be
indicated in patients with inoperable bilobar metastases in
whom hepatic artery embolisation has failed.171 It is a
relatively new modality which can be performed percuta￾neously or laparoscopically. The percutaneous approach is the
most commonly used, as it is least invasive, cheapest, and has
the additional benefit of CT or MRI guidance. The laparo￾scopic approach has the benefit of intraoperative ultrasound
scanning, which is ideal for the detection of tiny tumours but
does require considerable skill.172 Ablation can be used to
reduce hormone secretion and/or to reduce tumour burden.
Most patients with neuroendocrine metastases have a large
number of small metastases that are hormonally active.
The main limitation for radiofrequency ablation is the size
and number of tumours. For colorectal cancer, most groups
will treat up to five tumours up to 5 cm in size.
Neuroendocrine metastases are small, numerous, and very
slow growing. Therefore, it is possible to treat patients with
indolent disease with as many as 20 small (,3 cm) tumours
at multiple treatment sessions over a period of years.
Destroying the largest lesion may not necessarily switch off
hormone production. To achieve a reduction in hormone
secretion it is necessary to ablate at least 90% of the visible
tumour.173–178 Tumour location is not as important as for liver
resection. Patients who have biliary-enteric anastomoses
following pancreatic surgery are at risk of infection in the

9.11.2 Miscellaneous
Alcohol injection, laser therapy, and cryotherapy have also
been used anecdotally but with no large series and no
controlled trials.
9.12 External beam radiotherapy
Carcinoid tumours have often been regarded as being
radioresistant. However, external bean radiotherapy may
provide excellent relief of the pain from bone secondaries and
there has been a suggestion that some secondary deposits in
the liver and elsewhere shrink in response to radiotherapy.179
9.13 Emerging therapies
188Re-octreotide may be substituted for 99mTc-EDTA-HYNIC￾octreotide.148 177Lu-octreotate therapy has been recently
introduced.159 180–182 These are being studied at present and
are not yet licensed for the treatment of NETs. Some very
interesting new data are emerging about the potential role of
the cell signalling transduction agents, which affect tyrosine
kinase and other molecular markers, and important clinical
trials are about to start using these new agents. Imatinib has
been used for carcinoid tumours but no adequate data are
available. Trials using vaccines against various peptides are
planned.

An algorithm for the investigation and treatment of gut NETs
is given in fig 1.
11.0 PROGNOSIS
See also section 4.2 and table 3.
These are slow growing tumours but survival depends on
the histological type, degree of differentiation, mitotic rate,
Ki67 or MIB-1 index, tumour size (.3 cm), depth, location,
presence of liver or lymph node metastases, and age over
50 years.183–189 Following complete resection of the primary
tumour and liver metastases if present, the overall five year

Recommendations (therapy)
N The extent of the tumour, its metastases, and secretory
profile should be determined as far as possible before
planning treatment (grade C).
N Surgery should be offered to patients who are fit and
have limited disease—primary with or without regional
lymph nodes (grade C).
N Surgery should be considered in those with liver
metastases and potentially resectable disease (grade
D).
N Where abdominal surgery is undertaken and long term
treatment with SMS analogues is likely, cholecystec￾tomy should be considered.
N For patients who are not fit for surgery, the aim of
treatment is to improve and maintain an optimal
quality of life (grade D).
N The choice of treatment depends on the symptoms,
stage of disease, degree of uptake of radionuclide, and
histological features of the tumour (grade C).
N Treatment choices for non-resectable disease include
SMS analogues, biotherapy, radionuclides, ablation
therapies, and chemotherapy (grade C).
N External beam radiotherapy may relieve bone pain
from metastases (grade C).
N Chemotherapy may be used for inoperable or meta￾static pancreatic and bronchial tumours, or poorly
differentiated NETs (grade B).

survival is 83% but in cases where this is not possible survival
ranges from 30% to 70% depending on the factors above and
the treatment employed.75 91 102 190–196 The best prognosis is in
bronchial and appendicular carcinoids with a five year
survival for typical lung carcinoids and carcinoid tumours
of the appendix being 80–90% whereas that for atypical lung
tumours is 40–70%.193 197–199
The overall five year survival for pancreatic NETs is 50–
80%, with insulinoma and gastrinoma having up to 94% five
year survival,134 200–204 although clearly there is large variation
depending on the stage at presentation and whether curative
surgery is possible.

carcinoid tumours related to the primary site and degree of
spread.195
12.0 SUMMARY
There are many treatment modalities available and most are
very expensive. With poor evidence base, it is important
therefore for all cases to be discussed and managed within a
multidisciplinary team. The patient should have information
available with which to make rational choices about various
treatments. This information can be obtained through centres
who regularly treat these patients
UKNET is an organisation set up to discuss management of
carcinoid and gastroenteropancreatic NETs. Contact is the
UKNETWORK website: www.uk-network.org.uk
The patient support group can be contacted at
livingwithcarcinoid.org.uk (website under construction).

13.0 APPENDIX
PROTOCOL FOR HANDLING PANCREATIC
TUMOURS
This is modified from the RCPath document on the minimum
dataset for the reporting of pancreatic carcinoma73 and the
protocol for endocrine tumours of the pancreas of the Cancer
Committee of the College of American Pathologists.205 Unless
otherwise referenced, the criteria for classification are those
defined in the WHO classification (see table A1).69
The type of specimen should be recorded (for example,
Whipple’s pancreatoduodenectomy, left pancreatectomy).
Where possible, the site of the tumour should be stated
as in the head, body, or tail of the pancreas. The tumour
should be measured in three dimensions. The maximum
dimension is important in classification. Gross extension into
surrounding tissues is noted as this is regarded as a criterion
of malignancy. Completeness of excision should be assessed
by gross examination and confirmed by histological exam￾ination.
Representative blocks should be taken of the tumour (at
least one per cm diameter) and of encapsulated and
infiltrative margins.205 The closest margin should be sampled.
Samples of other pancreatic lesions should be processed but
not all nodules need be taken if they are multiple. Two or
three random blocks of apparently normal tissue should be
processed. Lymph nodes, in the specimen, or submitted
separately, should be processed. Their location should be
noted.
PROTOCOL FOR HANDLING GASTROINTESTINAL
SPECIMENS
These are modified from documents from the RCPath71 72
and the Cancer Committee of the College of American
Pathologists.206
The nature of the specimen should be recorded (for
example, endomucosal resection, ileal resection). The gross
appearances should be described and the site of the
tumour should be documented. A diagram may be helpful.
The tumour should be measured in three dimensions.
The maximum dimension is important in classification. The
serosal surface should be carefully examined in the area of
the tumour to assess penetration. Completeness of excision
should be assessed by gross examination and confirmed by
histological examination.
The number of blocks taken will depend on the size of the
tumour. They should be taken to permit the deepest level of
penetration through the bowel wall to be determined. Serial
transverse sections through the tumour should identify the
appropriate areas to sample. The mesoappendix should be
sampled in appendicectomy specimens. Excision margins are
usually sampled. A random block of normal tissue should
also be taken. Lymph nodes should be processed.
TISSUE PROCESSING
In general, standard blocks should be fixed in formalin, and
additional tumour and normal tissue should be snap frozen
and stored at 270˚C. The nature of the frozen tissue should
be confirmed by frozen section. If there is consent, additional
formalin fixed and frozen tissue should be processed for
research. Routine diagnostic sections should be stained
with haematoxylin and eosin. Histochemical stains, such as
the Grimelius silver stain, are non-specific and not
recommended.
IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY
All tumours should be immunostained with a panel of
antibodies to general neuroendocrine markers. These include
PGP9.5, synaptophysin, and CgA. Neurone specific enolase is
not recommended as it has poor specificity. Chromogranin
staining may be sparse or negative in poorly granulated
tumours.
The hormones produced will vary with the site, as shown
below. Where there has been evidence of ectopic hormone
secretion (for example, ectopic ACTH syndrome), immuno￾staining should be performed for the appropriate hormones.
Where there is a clinical syndrome related to a particular
hormone and immunohistochemistry is negative, in situ
hybridisation may be useful in identifying the messenger
RNA. The tumour should also be stained with an antibody to
Ki-67 protein, preferably MIB-1,207 to generate a Ki-67 index.
This has been shown to have diagnostic and prognostic
relevance in pancreatic tumours, although the cut off points
vary.208 209 Data are less well established for gastrointestinal
tumours.210 211

prolactin.
N Stomach and duodenum: gastrin, serotonin, somatostatin,
gastrin releasing peptide.
N Ileum and caecum: serotonin, tachykinins, substance P.
N Colon and rectum: serotonin, somatostatin, peptide YY.
N Appendix: serotonin, somatostatin, enteroglucagon.
PATHOLOGY REPORT
The report should contain the following data for all tumour
locations to allow the tumour to be classified according to the
WHO classification:
N Gross description
– nature of the specimen
– description and dimensions of the specimen
– description of lesion(s)—single or multifocal; solid or
cystic
dimensions (of largest if multifocal)
– extension into surrounding tissues
– distant metastases
N Microscopic report
– general morphological description
– immunohistochemical profile, general neuroendocrine
markers
– immunohistochemical (and/or in situ hybridisation)
profile, hormones
– mitotic rate (per 10 high power fields (640))
– Ki-67 index (%) (at low levels of proliferation it is
necessary to count a large number of cells to produce
robust data for a Ki-67 index. To facilitate this, a grid
might be used that allows the data to be calculated
from counting only a subset of total cells212).
– vascular, perineural, or lymphatic invasion
– completely excised (with distance to margin) or present
at excision margin
– infiltration of surrounding tissues
– lymph node status
– distant metastases
N For gastrointestinal tumours
– level of invasion
– tumour on serosal surface or not
– if not, level of invasion
– depth of maximal wall invasion (mm)
– distance to serosal surface (mm)
