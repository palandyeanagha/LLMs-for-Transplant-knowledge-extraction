Mitochondrial dysfunction contributes to cardiac pathologies. Barriers to new therapies
include an incomplete understanding of underlying molecular culprits and a lack of effective
mitochondria-targeted medicines. Here, we test the hypothesis that the cardiolipin-binding
peptide elamipretide, a clinical-stage compound under investigation for diseases of mito￾chondrial dysfunction, mitigates impairments in mitochondrial structure-function observed
after rat cardiac ischemia-reperfusion. Respirometry with permeabilized ventricular fibers
indicates that ischemia-reperfusion induced decrements in the activity of complexes I, II, and
IV are alleviated with elamipretide. Serial block face scanning electron microscopy used to
create 3D reconstructions of cristae ultrastructure reveals that disease-induced fragmenta￾tion of cristae networks are improved with elamipretide. Mass spectrometry shows elami￾pretide did not protect against the reduction of cardiolipin concentration after ischemia￾reperfusion. Finally, elamipretide improves biophysical properties of biomimetic membranes
by aggregating cardiolipin. The data suggest mitochondrial structure-function are inter￾dependent and demonstrate elamipretide targets mitochondrial membranes to sustain cristae
networks and improve bioenergetic function.

The biophysical organization of the mitochondrial inner
membrane regulates bioenergetics. Studies spanning fifty
years have described the intertwined relationship between
mitochondrial structure and function1,2, bolstered in more recent
years by advances in imaging modalities3–5. The composition of
the inner membrane is unique, comprised predominantly of
phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylcholine, and cardiolipin
(CL). Notably, CL represents a structurally distinct anionic
phospholipid enriched in the mitochondrial inner membrane6,7.
CL is postulated to exist in microdomains (i.e., distinct membrane
regions enriched in CL) that influence mitochondrial structure￾function8. CL is found at negatively curved regions of the inner
membrane, including cristae contact sites and along the inner
leaflet of cristae tubules6. CL is essential for protein import,
localization, and assembly, profoundly influencing mitochondrial
dynamics, energetics, and network continuity9,10. Previous stu￾dies established oxidation and subsequent lowering of CL content
across cardiac pathologies, including acute ischemia-reperfusion
(I/R)11,12 and heart failure13–15. Aside from exogenous perfusion
with CL16, which may only be applicable in experimental settings,
there are currently no therapies that can improve mitochondrial
function by targeting CL.
A number of cell permeable, mitochondria-targeting peptides
have emerged over the last two decades. This class of peptides
typically contain residues of alternating cationic-aromatic motifs
ranging from 4–16 amino acids (reviewed in ref. 17). Elamipretide
(formerly known as MTP-131, Bendavia, SS-31) is a cell￾permeable peptide currently being investigated in several clin￾ical trials to mitigate mitochondrial dysfunction associated with
genetic- and age-related mitochondrial diseases. This peptide
consists of a tetrapeptide sequence of D-arginine-dimethyltyr￾osine-lysine-phenylalanine. Preclinical studies spanning numer￾ous models and laboratories have demonstrated preserved
mitochondrial function and cytoprotection with this peptide
(reviewed in refs. 18–20), although the mechanism of action has
remained elusive. Previous work demonstrated that elamipretide
interacted with CL21, yet the physiological consequences of this
interaction are not fully understood. In this study, we utilized
high-resolution mitochondrial respiration and simultaneous
reactive oxygen species emission assays, biophysical membrane
models, and mitochondrial imaging (serial block-face scanning￾and transmission electron microscopy), to test the hypothesis that
elamipretide would improve post-ischemic mitochondrial
structure-function by aggregating mitochondrial CL molecules.
Results
Effects of I/R and elamipretide on mitochondrial respiration.
We first confirmed previous studies of myocardial uptake and
mitochondrial localization using a TAMRA-conjugated elami￾pretide (Supplemental Fig. 1). Mitochondrial functional studies
are presented in Fig. 1. In permeabilized ventricular fibers isolated
after reperfusion (“Post-I/R” Fibers), respiratory control ratios
(RCR; using glutamate/malate substrate) fell from 3.6 ± 0.2 in
normoxic fibers to 1.9 ± 0.1 after I/R. This decrement was par￾tially blunted with peptide treatment, with elamipretide leading to
a post-I/R RCR of 2.5 ± 0.1. The substrate-uncoupler-inhibitor￾titration (SUIT) protocol employed indicated decrements (aver￾age of −78% during state 3) in mitochondrial respiration across
complexes I–IV after ischemia-reperfusion. Post-ischemic
administration of elamipretide improved mitochondrial respira￾tion with complex I and II substrate by an average of 56% during
state 3 conditions (P < 0.05 compared to ischemia-reperfusion
alone, Fig. 1a), and tended to improve complex IV-dependent
respiration (+21%). Improved mitochondrial bioenergetics was
also supported by higher myocardial oxygen consumption in the
intact heart in post-ischemic hearts receiving elamipretide.
Effects of I/R and elamipretide on H2O2 emission. A major
limitation to using fibers in the above paradigm (isolating fibers
from the heart after I/R) was the inability to determine whether
the observed protection of mitochondrial energetics was a cause
or consequence of cardioprotection. Accordingly, we devised a
series of studies to determine the efficacy of elamipretide in
models where energetics can be measured during the insult.
Permeabilized ventricular fibers (from normoxic hearts) were
placed in a high-resolution respirometry chamber and respired
(saturating ADP present, “State 3”) until they consumed all of the
oxygen in the chamber, thus inducing anoxia. To account for
variability, each fiber preparation was normalized to its own
preanoxia, normoxic value. There were observable increased
levels of H2O2 at the onset of reoxygenation. Elamipretide
treatment reduced fiber H2O2 emission by 33% (Fig. 1b). This
effect persisted whether H2O2 rates were expressed alone or when
normalized to the fiber’s simultaneous oxygen consumption rate
(−36%).
We then determined if the mechanism of elamipretide involved
reduction in reactive oxygen species (ROS) emission through
reverse electron transfer (RET), presented in Fig. 1c–e. There was
a modest but statistically significant reduction in succinate￾derived RET when mitochondria were treated acutely with
elamipretide. This was reflected whether the H2O2 emission was
integrated over a five-minute timespan after succinate addition
(−13%) (Fig. 1d) or normalized to simultaneous oxygen flux
(−18%) (Fig. 1d). As expected, treatment with rotenone abolished
almost all RET (rates declined from around 40 pmol/sec*mg to
around 5 pmol/sec*mg). After rotenone treatment there were no
differences in the rates of H2O2 production between the saline
and elamipretide-treated mitochondria (Fig. 1e). We could rule
out if a subtle but statistically significant decrease in H2O2
emission after rotenone would become apparent with higher N’s.
Furthermore, the addition of the complex III blocker antimycin￾A was not done in these studies.
These mitochondrial function studies were accompanied by
studies to determine the macromolecular/supercomplex assembly
of electron transport system proteins. (Supplemental Fig. 2). There
was a 27% decrease in the supercomplex coupling (flux control
factor) after I/R, which was improved by 10% with elamipretide
(Supplemental Fig. 2D), although this did not directly correlate
with changes in mitochondrial supercomplex band density
(Supplemental Fig. 2A, C). There was a decrease in native complex
V after I/R (−51%), which was abrogated with elamipretide (+47%
versus I/R control) (Supplemental Fig. 2B, E). Although previous
studies have extracted supercomplex bands from the gel and
measured discernible respiration22, in our hands the changes in
respiration when substrates were given appeared to be an artifact,
as it was observed even when nonloaded acrylamide gel was placed
into the respirometer.
Effects of I/R and elamipretide on mitochondrial structure.
Given the integral relationships between mitochondrial function
and structure4,23, we employed two different electron microscopy
imaging modalities to determine mitochondrial morphology.
Results from transmission electron microscopy are presented in
Fig. 2, with representative images in Fig. 2a and Supplemental
Fig. 3. Ischemia-reperfusion induced an 18% increase in mito￾chondrial swelling, with I/R-saline-treated hearts displaying a
greater Feret diameter when compared to normoxic hearts

not markedly influence mitochondrial swelling based on trans￾mission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging. I/R induced a 35%
decrease in mitochondrial electron density (P < 0.05, Fig. 2c),
which was attenuated with elamipretide treatment by 34%. Sar￾comeric contracture (z-band width) was prominent with
ischemia-reperfusion (1.48 μM Normoxia vs. 1.18μM I/R + Sal￾ine, P < 0.05), and was not affected by post-ischemic elamipretide
treatment (1.18 μM I/R + Saline vs. 1.14 μM I/R + Elamipretide).
These sarcomere lengths were shorter than other reported values
in whole fixed tissue, which may be due to prolonged perfusion
with a crystalloid buffer or inconsistencies in the cutting plane of
our samples24–27.
Mitochondrial cristae complexity index was lowered after
reperfusion (−46%), and this decrease in cristae complexity was
attenuated with elamipretide by 36% (Fig. 2d). Cristae width
averaged 25.0 ± 1.8 nm in normoxic mitochondria (N = 189) and
was not influenced by I/R (cristae width: 25.4 ± 0.7 nm; N = 178)
or elamipretide treatment (26.7 ± 0.5 nm; N = 172).
Higher resolution serial block-face scanning electron micro￾scopy (SBF–SEM) was employed to obtain more advanced
structural insight of cardiac mitochondria after I/R. These data
are presented in Figs. 3 and 4 (along with reconstructed three￾dimensional movies in Supplemental Movies 1–3). Under
normoxic conditions, approximately 70% of cristae were
physically adhered to the inner boundary membrane, termed
“contact sites”. I/R injury led to a decrease (−37%) in the number
of cristae contact sites (Fig. 3a, b; P < 0.05 versus normoxia). Post￾ischemic administration of elamipretide blunted the loss of cristae
adhered to contact sites (+23% versus I/R injury) (Fig. 3b;
P < 0.05 versus I/R alone). Among adjoining mitochondria,
intermitochondrial cristae network connectivity analysis indi￾cated a substantial loss (−40%) in network connectivity between
mitochondria after I/R (presented in Fig. 3c, d). Intermitochon￾drial cristae connectivity improved in post-ischemic hearts
perfused with elamipretide by 24% (Fig. 3c, d).
Separate SBF–SEM analyses were conducted to determine the
extent of intra-mitochondrial cristae network connectivity. In
these studies, we attempted to map the connectivity of cristae
inside a subset of mitochondria using the rationale that contiguous
cristae facilitate efficient energy transfer. We termed cristae that
were interconnected “networked cristae”, versus cristae that were
disconnected from the network as “orphaned cristae”. From the
analysis, we rendered networked cristae yellow and orphaned
cristae red. These data are presented in Fig. 4 (with reconstructed
three-dimensional movies in Supplemental Movies 4–6). Interest￾ingly, in normoxic hearts 90% of all cristae appeared to be
networked with one another (Figs. 4b–d and S7), 22% more
matrix volume swelling, and a 22% loss of cristae volume occurred
after reperfusion, which were not prevented with elamipretide
(Fig. 4a–c). However, elamipretide increased the number of
“connected cristae” by 10% versus cristae that were orphaned from
the network (Fig. 4a, d). Furthermore, cristae that were
reconstructed appeared tubular. In healthy mitochondria, cristae
were often long, formed a lattice, and attached to the boundary
membrane. These features are similar to the “finger-like” digiti￾form cristae structure as previously described28. Taken together,
Fig. 1 Improvement of mitochondrial function with elamipretide. a Decrements in mitochondrial respiration were seen across different mitochondrial
complexes and substrate conditions in permeabilized fibers (N = 7–8 for all groups) and intact hearts (N = 3–4 for all groups), with elamipretide providing
improved function across complexes. b In permeabilized ventricular fibers, elamipretide reduced H2O2 emission associated with reoxygenation (N = 74 for

these data indicate that elamipretide did not prevent mitochon￾drial swelling or the loss of total cristae at reperfusion, but
improved cristae contact sites with the boundary membrane and
reticular connectivity among the cristae network.
Mass spectrometry analyses of CL content and composition.
The functional and structural importance of CL led us to conduct
shotgun lipidomic studies for CL content and acyl chain com￾position. These data are presented in Fig. 5a, b, with the 20 most
abundant CL species presented in Table 1. There was a 23%
decrease in the total amount of CL after ischemia-reperfusion, as
well as a 28% decline in the most abundant CL species (18:2-18:2-
18:2-18:2) CL. The acute administration of elamipretide at the
onset of reperfusion did not abrogate a reduction in CL content,
the decrease in (18:2-18:2-18:2-18:2) CL species, or alter any of
the other CL species examined (Fig. 5a, b and Table 1).
Biophysical studies of elamipretide. To better understand the
biophysical interaction of elamipretide with cardiac mitochon￾drial membranes, we synthesized biomimetic membranes of the
inner mitochondrial membrane. The model allowed us to tightly
control lipid composition. Mitochondrial models were composed
of biologically relevant lipids (see methods), and a CL content
that represented 20% of the total lipids (consistent with content
percentages seen across mammalian mitochondria29).
Informed by our CL lipidomic studies (Fig. 5a, b), we modeled
the effects of decreased CL content after ischemia-reperfusion in
biomimetic mitochondrial membranes by examining the
biophysical interactions using a Langmuir trough (which
provided mean molecular pressure-area isotherms of compressed
lipid monolayers). A 25% reduction of CL content (“I/R model”)
resulted in a 5% reduction in the mean molecular area at a
physiological membrane pressure of 30 mN/m (Fig. 5c). Acute
addition of elamipretide to I/R biomimetic membranes restored
the mean molecular area in biomimetic monolayers with reduced
CL (Fig. 5c) and oxidized CL (Fig. 5d). We also modeled severe
reduction of CL content (50%, more comparable to some genetic
mitochondrial diseases) and also saw a 7% improvement with
elamipretide treatment versus I/R (albeit not restoring the area to
the non-pathological membrane levels). Notably, elamipretide
treatment of biomimetic monolayers without CL present had no
discernible effect on membrane behavior (Fig. 5c, left panel).
To compliment the monolayer studies, we synthesized
biomimetic mitochondrial lipid vesicles of similar composition.
In the absence of peptide, CL fluorescence (assessed by nonyl
acridine orange (NAO) localization) was uniform across the
vesicle membrane and was accompanied by no observable
aggregation of adjacent vesicles. Upon the addition of elamipretide
to biomimetic vesicles, the NAO signal clustered into enriched
domains. This CL clustering colocalized with fluorescent
TAMRA-elamipretide (Fig. 5e), providing a complement to our
imaging in intact cells (Supplemental Fig. 1). Furthermore,
addition of elamipretide promoted aggregation of adjacent lipid
vesicles (Fig. 5e) suggesting a potential mechanism of action
(Fig. 5f). This aggregation effect was not seen in vesicles devoid of
CL, and our previous work has shown that proteins that do not
associate with CL do not have this effect on CL aggregation30.

Additionally, we serendipitously discovered that CL-containing
vesicles and elamipretide eventually precipitated when in solution
together (Supplemental Fig. 4). Titration studies indicated that
elamipretide aggregated CL-enriched vesicles, essentially saturat￾ing the signal at a molar ratio of one peptide to two CL
(Supplemental Fig. 4).
Discussion
This study advanced our understanding of mitochondrial
structure-function in hearts exposed to ischemia-reperfusion.
First, we found parallel decrements in mitochondrial cristae
ultrastructure and respiratory function noted across electron
transport system complexes after ischemia-reperfusion. Second,
we used an innovative approach to map mitochondrial network
connectivity in the heart, discovering decrements among and
between mitochondrial cristae networks after ischemia￾reperfusion. This aspect of our study employed the application
of serial block-face scanning electron microscopy (SBF–SEM) to
determine and quantify changes in mitochondrial cristae struc￾ture and connectivity in cardiac pathology. Third, the studies
provided new mechanistic insight into elamipretide, a clinical￾stage peptide that appears to aggregate CL and improve mito￾chondrial membrane structure and bioenergetic function without
preventing the acute, reperfusion-induced decrease in CL content.
Finally, we employed the use of biomimetic membranes to
directly quantify membrane-dependent effects of pathologies and
putative therapeutics.
The mitochondrial network is an attractive target for adjuvant
therapies20,31. The factors that promote bioenergetic impairments
include: reactive oxygen species production that exceeds endo￾genous scavenging capacity, matrix calcium overload, imbalances
in substrate content/composition, inner membrane uncoupling,
membrane lipid oxidation/degradation, inefficient electron flux,
opening of energy-dissipating channels/pores, and collapse(s) in
mitochondrial membrane potential (reviewed in refs. 8,32,33). A
number of different pharmacological approaches have investi￾gated the aforementioned factors, with several compounds pro￾gressing to clinical trials (reviewed in ref. 34). Our work advanced
the field by showing that mitochondrial function could be
improved by targeting decrements related to CL.
CL contributes to membrane structure by imparting negative
membrane curvature35 at cristae junctions and along the inner
leaflet of cristae membranes (depicted in Fig. 6). CL also serves as a
membrane anchor for mitochondrial proteins essential for the
cristae assembly/morphology, including ATP synthase dimers36–40,
OPA140–43, mitoregulin44, and components of the mitochondrial
contact site and cristae organizing system (MICOS)10,45–49.
Although the role of proteins in influencing cristae structure
cannot be understated, proton-dependent cristae formation was
observed in membrane lipid vesicles devoid of any proteins50.
A reduction in the concentration of (18:2-18:2-18:2-18:2) CL that
we observed was consistent with previous studies (refs. 12,16,51,52).
Likewise, mitochondrial ultrastructural defects, similar to what we
observed, are reported across other pathologies23 characterized by a
decrease of CL concentration and corresponding cristae7. CL
replacement strategies have been tested and include direct perfusion
of CL to isolated rat hearts16 and utilization of CL-containing
nanodiscs53. While promising, the translational relevance of these
paradigms for patients remains to be demonstrated.

Our finding of multi-complex dysfunction after ischemia￾reperfusion compliments previous studies noting decrements in
complex activity, subunit oxidation, and augmented ROS pro￾duction along the electron transport system33,54–63.
Mitochondria-targeting peptides represent an emerging class of
therapeutics that are being tested across diseases. These peptides
share structural homology with endogenous mitochondria￾targeting sequences, which are both amphipathic and cationic64.
Most mitochondria-targeting peptides contain alternating
cationic-aromatic amino acid motifs17,65,66. Mitochondria￾targeted peptides appear to be lipophilic enough to cross mem￾brane barriers, typically contain arginine (especially the D-isomer
for enzymatic stability), and are postulated to hone to mito￾chondria based on the negative membrane potential, the presence
of anionic phospholipids (such as CL), or combinations thereof.
Elamipretide is a salt-variant of the SS-31 peptide first seren￾dipitously discovered by Szeto and Schiller67 in their search for
opioid receptor ligands. This peptide showed protective efficacy
across preclinical studies (reviewed in refs. 8,19). Improved post￾ischemic respiratory function with elamipretide was observed
across complexes, in agreement with previous studies where
elamipretide improved activity or expression of several different
electron transport complexes15,68–70. These data suggest that
elamipretide’s mechanism of action does not depend on one
particular protein or complex. The improved bioenergetic func￾tion across complexes was suggested by studies examining the
existence of native protein complexes. Supercomplex coupling
control factor71, a functional measure of the ‘intactness’ of
respirasomes, and native complex V structure were both impaired
after ischemia-reperfusion and improved with elamipretide
(Supplemental Fig. 2D, E). Although the functional significance of
improved complex V density was not directly tested, the miti￾gation of electron transport chain dysfunction observed with
elamipretide suggests the peptide may lessen decrements in ATP
production previously observed after I/R72. We did not find
evidence of a robust decrease in supercomplex band density after
ischemia-reperfusion. These results are consistent with other
studies examining supercomplexes after acute cardiac ischemia￾reperfusion73,74, which generally show modest effects of
ischemia-reperfusion on supercomplex band density. These
findings also corroborated previous work where cardioprotection
was not associated with augmented supercomplex band density75.
Given the sensitivity of native protein complexes to detergent
conditions74,76,77 and the issue of sample bias in isolating mito￾chondrial supercomplexes from infarcted myocardium (i.e., iso￾lation procedures enrich for healthy mitochondria), future studies
are warranted to better understand the relevance of blue-native
supercomplexes in models of cardiac pathology.
The SS-31 peptide was originally described as a “scavenger” of
reactive oxygen species. While it is clear that elamipretide can
reduce overall ROS levels from pathological mitochondria
(refs. 15,78, and Fig. 1 herein), several lines of evidence suggest
that it is not scavenging ROS. We previously showed that the
peptide was not scavenging either superoxide or hydrogen per￾oxide using cell-free model systems18. Other groups reported that
elamipretide-mediated reductions in ROS are observed in dis￾eased tissues but not healthy tissues68,79, also suggesting that the
peptide may be reducing pathological production of ROS and not
scavenging per se. Preconditioning of the heart, which has been
shown to involve small bursts of ROS that trigger adaptive

responses and is typically abolished with “ROS scavengers”, was
not abolished with elamipretide80. Our finding of reduced ROS
emission in permeabilized ventricular fibers and a modest
reduction in RET81 provides further evidence that the peptide
may be reducing succinate-derived RET early in reperfusion.
Interestingly, elamipretide-mediated reductions in ROS produc￾tion by the electron transport chain (ETC) were not observed
downstream of ubiquinone (Fig. 1), suggesting an alternative
mechanism than one involving cytochrome c-mediated
injury21,82.
We observed interactions between elamipretide and CL, con￾firming findings first made by Birk et al.21,82. Among endogenous
proteins, cationic amino acid residues are known to associate with
CL44. Results from our microscopy studies with NAO and ela￾mipretide colocalization suggest the peptide interacts with CL,
which we speculate was driven by the cationic amino acids. We
acknowledge that a limitation of our work is the use of a sim￾plified biomimetic model system that lacks proteins. Future stu￾dies will require the incorporation of differing proteins into
biomimetic membranes. An additional potential limitation of our
work could be the use of imaging, which could introduce artifacts
during sample preparation and analyses. Therefore, future studies
will need to effectively integrate imaging, biochemical, and bio￾physical approaches.
Acute elamipretide treatment at reperfusion did not prevent
the loss in CL content observed after acute ischemia-reperfusion.
While longer term administration of elamipretide (>4 weeks)
normalized aberrant CL in canine models of heart failure15 and
pigs with metabolic syndrome70, our data indicated that the
peptide has acute activity to preserve mitochondrial structure￾function even in the presence of CL deficiencies. This beneficial
activity suggests that the peptide may be effective in diseases
characterized by a reduction of CL concentration (such as genetic
mitochondrial diseases and/ or Barth syndrome [BTHS]).
The lowering or oxidation of CL modeled after ischemia￾reperfusion led to a discernible change in the membrane structure
(Fig. 5). Elamipretide promoted a physical ‘aggregation’ of CL
molecules where the peptide is acting like a membrane adhesion
factor for the CL that is present (even if it is oxidized). As it is
difficult to study mammalian mitochondria devoid of CL, our
finding that elamipretide-mediated lipid aggregation is not pre￾sent without CL highlights the preferential nature of this
interaction.
The nature of the physical aggregation between CL and ela￾mipretide remains to be studied in the future. One approach
would be to use fluorescently labeled CL to understand its
complex relationship with the peptide; however, it will be
critical to demonstrate that fluorescently labeled CL shows the
same biophysical properties as native CL, which is unlikely to
be the case due to the presence of bulky fluorescent groups.
Additional studies are needed to understand the nature of the
physical interaction of CL with the peptide as a function of
changes in surface pressure. Our experiments relied on 30 mN/m
as this is the gold standard in the field for biological relevance;
however, surface pressure in the inner mitochondrial membrane
likely varies with curvature and matrix swelling. To the best of
our knowledge, the surface pressure as a function of cristae
curvature remains to be established but is an important area
for study.
The finding of improved mitochondrial ultrastructure with
elamipretide in cardiac ischemia-reperfusion injury agrees with
previous work where elamipretide improved mitochondrial
morphology in other diseases70,82,83. We specifically provide
insight into mitochondrial structure using higher resolution,
SBF–SEM, which is an imaging approach capable of creating
high-resolution 3D images that provide quantitative data on
mitochondrial cristae morphology. The technical operation is also
less demanding than other imaging approaches for performing
volume analyses (i.e., serial section TEM and focused ion beam
SEM), and SBF–SEM analysis is within the capabilities of many
labs that lack previous EM experience84. The relationship
between changes in mitochondrial morphology and functional
outcomes remains unclear as reported here and by others85.
Therefore, there is a critical need to further understand how
modest changes in morphology could be driving key changes in
the biophysical properties of the inner mitochondrial membrane
to control respiratory function, an area for future investigation.
The finding that cristae contact sites were disrupted in the
post-ischemic heart compliment altered contact sites seen in
other diseases86,87. Elamipretide did not prevent the loss in total
cristae with reperfusion (Fig. 4c), consistent with a lack of pro￾tection against decreased CL content (Table 1 and Fig. 5a, b), as
these are inter-related50,88. A major advancement using this
technology was that elamipretide partially restored the cristae
network connectivity. This may help explain the protection of
ATP synthase dimers with elamipretide, as ATP synthase and
cristae architecture have shown interdependent declines in other
pathologies38. However, more studies are needed to confirm this
hypothesis as we did not specifically study the interdependence of
cristae shape and ATP synthase. The modest reduction in RET we
observed was also associated with improved cristae ultrastructure.
Accordingly, it might be hypothesized that succinate accumula￾tion induces RET, which has been associated with mitochondrial
fragmentation89.
If any generalizations can be made about elamipretide’s
mechanism across studies, it is that this peptide appears to exert
Fig. 6 Proposed model in which elamipretide (depicted in magenta—right panel) aggregates CL (depicted in yellow) to preserve cristae ultrastructure
in diseased mitochondria. Preserved cristae integrity was associated with protection of complex V (red) band density. The other electron transport chain
complexes are depicted in green, yellow, and purple (middle panel). Therapeutic approaches that target CL may conserve inner mitochondrial membrane
integrity, maintain cristae contact sites, sustain intra and intermitochondrial networks, and improve mitochondrial function during disease states.

biological effects predominantly when there is an underlying
pathological burden present. In these cases, it tends to ‘normalize’
mitochondrial function that is dysfunctional prior to elamipretide
exposure. The ability of elamipretide to prolong PTP
opening15,18, improve exercise capacity79, promote CL
remodeling15,70, reduce apoptotic signaling90, stimulate state 3
respiration21, or improve the activity of several different ETC
complexes15,68–70 is only observed in diseased, aged, or damaged
(respiratory control ratio <2) mitochondria. There appears to be
translational support for this concept, as a recent clinical trial
with elamipretide showed the greatest 6-min-walk benefit in
patients who began the study with the largest functional
impairments91.
A clinical trial using elamipretide in first time ST-segment
elevation myocardial infarction patients did not reduce infarct
size92. Exclusion of ~40% of the patient population due to patent
arteries at the time of reperfusion, and group differences in
baseline characteristics may have influenced the results. As we
and others have recently noted, a number of factors likely to
contribute to lack of translation in cardiac ischemia-reperfusion
paradigms34,93.
As the sequence of elamipretide contains two non-natural
amino acids, there is no known homology between this peptide
and endogenous assembly or mitochondrial fusion factors,
although the upregulation of cristae assembly factors (such as
OPA1) has been recently observed after elamipretide
treatment94,95. Given the cationic and aromatic repeats, and the
fact that many mitochondrial assembly proteins have conserved
RYL or RYK motifs44,96–98, it is tempting to speculate that the
peptide is acting as an enzymatically resistant, cell-permeable
analog of an endogenous assembly factor(s). Such a mechanism
may explain why there are little/no observable effects in healthy
mitochondria across studies with elamipretide as noted above.
Healthy inner membranes may be sufficiently intact such that the
addition of an adhesion factor has a negligible effect. This type of
mechanism may also promote the utility of this peptide (and
related analogs) across mitochondrial pathologies that share the
commonality of structural abnormalities3,4. Clearly further testing
is warranted to better elucidate the efficacy of elamipretide across
other pathologies.
Our study provides insight into mitochondrial structure￾function derangements in acute ischemia-reperfusion by com￾bining functional measurements in mitochondria, fibers, and the
intact heart, with new imaging modalities examining cristae
architecture. Results indicate that while elamipretide does not
prevent the reduction of CL concentration, post-ischemic treat￾ment can improve functional and morphological characteristics
of mitochondria even with decreased CL content. These char￾acteristics include improved electron transport chain complex
respiration, decreased H2O2 production, increased mitochondrial
density, increased cristae connectivity, enhanced cristae net￾working within and between mitochondria, and finally, improved
inner membrane integrity. The use of biomimetic models has
profound potential to expand our understanding of the con￾sequences of phospholipid alterations. Future studies utilizing
these approaches will advance the development of mitochondria￾targeting strategies.
Methods
Animals. Male Sprague–Dawley rats (aged 2–3 months) were used in the study. All
procedures received prior approval from the Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committees at East Carolina University, Latvian Animal Protection Ethical
Committee of Food and Veterinary Service, and Virginia Tech. Animals were
housed in a temperature and light-controlled environment and received food and
water ad libitum. Prior to excision of the heart, animals received an intraperitoneal
(ip) injection of a ketamine/xylazine solution (90 mg/kg/10 mg/kg, respectively),
and hearts were excised following the diminution of animal reflexes via midline
thoracotomy and placed in ice-cold saline.
Materials. All phospholipids were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids Inc. Ela￾mipretide and the TAMRA-elamipretide conjugate were synthesized by New
England Peptide. All organic solvents were HPLC grade and all other reagents were
purchased from either Fisher Scientific or Sigma.
I/R and respirometry of permeabilized ventricular fibers. Excised hearts were
perfused on one of four modified Langendorff apparatus (AD Instruments) per our
established protocols99,100. Hearts were exposed to 20/120 min of global ischemia/
reperfusion, respectively. For the elamipretide treatment, hearts received 10μM
elamipretide beginning at the onset of reperfusion, which is a well-established
cardioprotective paradigm in our models18,78,80,101. Myocardial oxygen con￾sumption was measured at the end of reperfusion in a subset of hearts per our
established protocols102. At the end of reperfusion, hearts were split into the
experimental groups described below. Two different protocols were employed to
determine mitochondrial function after ischemic stress in ventricular muscle fibers.
The first set determined mitochondrial function in fibers isolated after cardiac
ischemia- reperfusion (“Post I/R Studies”). The second set of studies isolated
cardiac fibers from a freshly isolated (normoxic) heart, and then induced anoxia￾reoxygenation on the isolated fibers (“A/R Studies”). Detailed methods for the fiber
studies are provided in the Methods Supplement. Below (Supplemental Fig. 5) is an
overview of the permeabilized experimental flow.
Isolated mitochondria and BN-PAGE. Mitochondria were isolated from the left
ventricle and succinate-derived reverse electron transport determined using our
established protocols103. Detailed protocols for the separation of native mito￾chondrial respiratory chain complexes by BN-PAGE are described in the Methods
Supplement. Supercomplex flux control coupling factor was measured as
described97.
Electron microscopy of mitochondria. A subset of hearts exposed to ischemia￾reperfusion (as described above) were utilized for transmission electron microscopy
imaging (Virginia Tech Morphology Service Core Laboratory, Virginia-Maryland
College of Veterinary Medicine) using modifications to established protocols104,105.
Serial block-face scanning electron microscopy was done in collaboration with
Renovo Neural, Inc. (Cleveland, Ohio). Detailed methods are provided in the
Methods Supplement.
Mass spectrometry. A subset of hearts was taken immediately at the end of
reperfusion and the left ventricle was snap frozen, pulverized using a liquid
nitrogen-cooled mortar/pestle, and analyzed for CL content and composition using
shotgun lipidomics per our established methods106. Detailed protocols for the mass
spectroscopy studies are provided in the Methods Supplement.
Construction of biomimetic membranes. A detailed description of the methods
for biophysical CL aggregation studies are provided in the Methods Supplement.
Pressure-area isotherm experiments were performed using differing biomimetic
lipid compositions. For pressure-area isotherms displayed in Fig. 5c, biomimetic
mitochondrial lipid monolayers were generated by co-dissolving 40 mol% (18:0-
22:6) PC, 30.0 mol% (16:0-20:4) PE, 20 mol% (18:2-18:2-18:2-18:2) CL, 5 mol%
(18:1-18:1) PI, 3 mol% (18:1-18:1) PS, and 2 mol% cholesterol in chloroform
(10 μg/μL) per our established methods107. Pressure-area isotherms displayed in
Fig. 5d relied on biomimetic monolayers containing 40 mol% (18:0-22:6) PC,
33.0 mol% (16:0-20:4) PE, 20 mol% (18:2-18:2-18:2-18:2) CL, 5 mol% (18:1-18:1)
PS, and 2 mol% cholesterol in chloroform (10 μg/μL). The area per molecule was
determined at a physiological surface pressure of 30 mN/m as previously shown108.
Giant unilamellar vesicles were constructed via electroformation as previously
described30 and contained 39.9 mol% (18:0-22:6) PC, 30.0 mol% (16:0-20:4) PE,
20 mol% (18:2-18:2-18:2-18:2) CL, 5 mol% (18:1-18:1) PI, 3 mol% (18:1-18:1) PS,
2 mol% cholesterol, and 0.1 mol% NAO. For select experiments, the total CL
concentration was decreased 25-50% by mass to reflect changes seen from mass
spectroscopy studies. In a subset of studies peptide was added immediately after
spotting the lipid monolayer or prior to imaging.
Statistics and reproducibilty. All data were analyzed using and GraphPad Prism
8 and are presented as mean ± sem. Data were distributed normally, which allowed
for parametric analyses. Statistical analyses were conducted using a one-way
ANOVA followed by a Bonferroni post-hoc, with P-values ≤ 0.05 considered
significant. One trace from RET studies was excluded because the hydrogen per￾oxide emission was greater than two standard deviations away from the mean.
