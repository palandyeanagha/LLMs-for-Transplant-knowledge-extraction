Abstract
Allelic imbalance or loss of heterozygosity (LOH) studies have been
used extensively to identify regions on chromosomes that may
contain putative tumour-suppressor genes. We have undertaken an
extensive allelotype of 80 specimens of squamous cell carcinoma of
the head and neck (SCCHN) using 145 polymorphic microsatellite
markers on 39 chromosome arms. Allelic imbalances were found
most frequently on chromosome arms 3p, 9p, 17p and 18q with
over 45% LOH and imbalances on 1p, 1q, 2p, 5q, 6p, 6q, 8p, 8q, 9q,
11q, 13q, 17q and 19q were found in more than 20% of SCCHN.
These LOH data were analysed against a range of
clinicopathological parameters which included previously untreated
and previously treated tumours; correlations were found between
LOH on 9q and nodes at pathology (P = 0.02) and between
histopathological grade and LOH on 12q (P = 0.02) and 13q (P =
0.01). In the group of previously untreated tumours, a correlation
was found between site of tumour and LOH on 3p (P = 0.019), and
8p (P = 0.029), while TNM staging correlated with LOH on 3p (P
= 0.019) and 17p (P = 0.016). Fractional allele loss (FAL) was
calculated for 52 tumours with LOH data on nine or more
chromosomal arms and found to have a median value of 0.22
(range 0.0-0.80). Correlations were found between FAL > median
value and nodes at pathology (P = 0.01) and tumour grade (P =
0.06), demonstrating that advanced tumours with lymph node
metastasis often had LOH at multiple sites. FAL > median value
was found to correlate with a poor survival (P < 0.03) and,
furthermore, FAL > median value correlated with poor survival in
the previously untreated patients (P < 0.019). These results
indicate that assessment of the accumulation of genetic damage, as
provided by allelotype data, provides a useful molecular indicator
of the tumour behaviour and clinical outcome.
