Abstract
Background: Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC) is a rare chronic, cholestatic liver condition in which patients can
experience a range of debilitating symptoms. Patient reported outcome measures (PROMs) could provide a
valuable insight into the impact of PSC on patient quality of life and symptoms. A previous review has been
conducted on the quality of life instruments used in liver transplant recipients. However, there has been no
comprehensive review evaluating PROM use or measurement properties in PSC patients’ to-date. The aim of the
systematic review was to: (a) To identify and categorise which PROMs are currently being used in research involving
the PSC population (b) To investigate the measurement properties of PROMs used in PSC.
Methods: A systematic review of Medline, EMBASE and CINAHL, from inception to February 2018, was undertaken.
The methodological quality of included studies was assessed using the Consensus-based Standards for selection of
health Measurement Instruments (COSMIN) checklist.
Results: Thirty-seven studies were identified, which included 36 different PROMs. Seven PROMs were generic, 10
disease-specific, 17 symptom-specific measures and 2 measures on dietary intake. The most common PROMs were
the Short form-36 (SF-36) (n = 15) and Chronic liver disease questionnaire (CLDQ) (n = 6). Only three studies
evaluated measurement properties, two studies evaluated the National Institute of Diabetes Digestive and Kidney
Diseases Liver Transplant (NIDDK-QA) and one study evaluated the PSC PRO; however, according to the COSMIN
guidelines, methodological quality was poor for the NIDDK-QA studies and fair for the PSC PRO study.
Conclusion: A wide variety of PROMs have been used to assess health-related quality of life and symptom burden
in patients with PSC; however only two measures (NIDDK-QA and PSC PRO) have been formally validated in this
population. The newly developed PSC PRO requires further validation in PSC patients with diverse demographics,
comorbidities and at different stages of disease; however this is a promising new measure with which to assess the
impact of PSC on patient quality of life and symptoms.

Background
Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC) is a chronic, chole￾static liver condition that results in inflammation and fi￾brosis that can involve the entire biliary tree [1]. PSC is
a progressive disorder and can lead to cirrhosis, portal
hypertension and liver failure [1].
Approximately 1 in 100,000 people in the general popu￾lation is affected with PSC per year in Europe and the
United States [2]. The disease occurs at any age, but is
more prevalent in adults between the ages of 30–60 years
and is more common in men than in women. Approxi￾mately 70–80% of patients with PSC have an associated
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) such as ulcerative col￾itis or Crohn’s disease [3]. Currently, there is no known li￾censed medication to prevent the progression of PSC,
which if left untreated can result in increasing disability
and even death [4]. In patients with end-stage PSC liver
disease, the only therapeutic option currently available is a
liver transplant [4].
Although overall disease progression can be slow, pa￾tients with PSC can experience a range of debilitating
symptoms. In the early stage of the disease, symptoms
include tiredness or fatigue. In more advanced cases,
symptoms include pruritus, jaundice, abdominal pain,
weight loss, fevers, hyperpigmentation, vitamin deficien￾cies and metabolic bone disease [5]; all of which can
have a significant impact on health-related quality of life
(HRQOL) [6, 7].
Increasingly in chronic diseases and terminal illness, it
is recognised that maintaining HRQOL is an important
consideration when the treatment is aimed at mainten￾ance rather than a cure, or the treatment has a high level
of toxicity [8]. Many of the current therapeutic interven￾tions in PSC are aimed at managing symptoms. Measur￾ing the impact of these interventions and preserving
HRQOL is an important aspect of PSC care. This re￾quires patient reported outcome measures (PROMs) that
are sensitive enough to capture changes in HRQOL or
symptoms over time.
Increasingly, PROMs use has demonstrated a positive
contribution to clinical practice and research [9]. In clin￾ical practice, aggregate level PROM data can help us to
understand the burden of chronic medical conditions,
identify health inequalities [10] and determine new areas
for therapeutic interventions. They can also play a key
role in benchmarking and audit. [11] At an individual
patient level, PROMs can be used to monitor the re￾sponse, adverse effects and benefits of treatments in rou￾tine practice, [12] facilitating communication between
clinicians and patients regarding their HRQOL, symp￾tom management and control [13–15].
A previous review investigating the quality of life (QOL)
instruments used in liver transplant recipients has been
conducted [16]. However, to date, no comprehensive
review of PROMs used in PSC patients has been under￾taken. There is a clear need to evaluate the measurement
properties of the PROMs currently used in this population
to determine the optimal measures for use in future re￾search and routine care. Therefore the objectives of this
systematic review were to: (a) identify and categorise
PROMs currently used in research involving the PSC
population; and (b) investigate their measurement proper￾ties, to help inform the selection of PROMs for use in fu￾ture PSC research and routine practice.
Methods
The following guidelines were used, where applicable, to
inform the conduct and reporting of this study: (i) the
Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and
Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) [17] guidance (see Add￾itional file 1 for the PRISMA checklist), (ii) COnsensus
based Standards for the selection of health Measurement
INstruments (COSMIN) guidance [18] and (iii) the up￾dated method guidelines for systematic reviews in
Cochrane collaboration back review group [19]. The
study was registered with PROSPERO (Registration
Number: CRD42016036544).
Search strategy
A systematic search was conducted on the following
electronic databases: Medline, EMBASE and CINAHL
from inception to 15 February 2018. The search terms
“Primary sclerosing cholangitis” and “Patient reported
outcome measures” were used, alongside synonyms and
related terms (see Additional file 2 for the full search strat￾egy). These terms were combined with the COSMIN
search filters developed by VU University Medical Centre
Amsterdam and University of Oxford (available on COS￾MIN website: http://www.cosmin.nl/). In addition, papers
included in the full text review were subjected to a hand
search of reference lists [20, 21].
Inclusion criteria
Studies were eligible if:
a) PROMs were included in the study meeting the
FDA definition [22].
b) Study participants were patients with PSC.
In addition:
c) Studies that evaluated at least one measurement
property (i.e. reliability, validity, responsiveness, inter￾pretability) were included in the COSMIN quality
review.
No restriction was placed on age or gender of partici￾pants or language, publication date or country of origin
of the study.

Selection of studies
Two reviewers (FI/GT or GT/GK) independently
screened studies according to their title and abstract to
determine eligibility. Following this, the full text of po￾tentially eligible studies was retrieved and screened inde￾pendently by two independent reviewers (FI/GT or GT/
GK). The protocol planned that discrepancies would be
discussed with a third investigator (MG or DK or AS) to
reach consensus; however, this was not required.
Data extraction
The two independent reviewers (GT plus FI, GK or AS)
independently extracted the data from each study using
a predefined form (including study design and patient
level characteristics). Information regarding each PROM
was extracted, including: constructs, therapeutic area,
domains, number of items, scoring method, recall
period, administration, completion time, data collection,
cost/permission and measurement properties (reliability,
validity, responsiveness, interpretability).
Content comparison of included PROMs
A summary of PROMs used in studies of PSC patients,
including an overview of included domains and specific
content was prepared. The PROMs were categorised ac￾cording to their domains to facilitate comparison of the
measures that have been used in PSC studies to-date.
Quality assessment
The COSMIN checklist [23] was used to assess the
methodological quality of studies that reported on the
measurement properties of PROMs used in the study.
Two reviewers (FI/GT or GT/AW) independently com￾pleted the COSMIN checklist. The protocol planned that
discrepancies would be discussed with a third reviewer;
however, this was not required. Each measurement
property was scored according to the quality of report￾ing by the publication, using a four-point rating scale:
‘excellent’, ‘good’, ‘fair’ and ‘poor’. The methodological
quality of each study was rated by taking the lowest
score (worst score counts method) per domain. For ex￾ample, if any of the items of the domain reliability was
scored ‘poor’, the overall score for regarding the meth￾odological quality of reliability was rated as ‘poor’.
Evidence synthesis
Synthesis of measurement property evidence was per￾formed using standardised criteria developed by Terwee
2011 [23]. The summary of the overall evidence of meas￾urement properties of the PROMs was determined by
the number of studies, the methodological quality of the
studies, and consistency of the findings. Based on these
factors the overall rating of a measurement property per
PROM was ranked as “+” positive, “?” indeterminate or
“-” negative and combined with an assessment of the
overall level of supporting evidence (strong, moderate,
limited, conflicting, unknown) as proposed by the
Cochrane Back Review Group [24].
Results
Study selection
In total, 8074 studies were identified, 5893 remained
after duplicate removal and 150 remained after review￾ing titles and abstracts (Fig. 1). Following review of the
150 full texts, 37 studies, containing 36 different
PROMs, were included.
Table 1 summarises the general characteristics of the
included studies. The study designs included 17
cross-sectional studies, five randomised controlled trials
(RCTs), four case-control studies, two validation study,
two pilot study, two before and after study, one
cost-effectiveness study, one case matched study, one
longitudinal study, one cohort study and one retrospect￾ive case series study.
Twenty seven of the 37 included studies used PROMs
to examine the impact of PSC on patients and seven of
these measured the effectiveness of treatments: one
study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of liver transplant￾ation, one study assessed health utilities and two were
validation studies of the PROMs: the National Institute
of Diabetes Digestive and Kidney Diseases Liver Trans￾plant (NIDDK-QA) and the Primary Sclerosing Cholan￾gitis Patient Reported Outcome (PSC PRO).
In total, 3742 patients with PSC were recruited to the
included studies (sample size range n = 4–1000). All par￾ticipants were adults, with the exception of one study [25]
which included patients with the mean age of 11.6 years.
Studies were heterogeneous in terms of population demo￾graphic characteristics. In the thirty-five studies that re￾ported gender, the proportion of PSC patients who were
males ranged from 15 to 97%. Five studies reported a rela￾tively wide range of mean Mayo risk scores (− 0.1 to 2.87)
for PSC patients, a score which estimates patient survival
in PSC [6, 26–29]. Twenty-four studies described the pro￾portion of IBD in PSC patients, ranging from 7 to 100%.
In 12 studies, the percentage of PSC patients who had re￾ceived a liver transplant ranged from 12 to 100%.
Characteristics of PROMs
Characteristics of the 36 included PROMs are presented
in Table 2. The most frequently used PROM was the Short
Form 36 health survey (SF-36) (n = 15), followed by the
Chronic Liver Disease Questionnaire (CLDQ) (n = 6) and
the Primary Biliary Cirrhosis (PBC)-40 (n = 5). All other
PROMs were used in ≤3 studies (Table 1).
There were seven generic measures including: the 15
Dimensional Health-Related Quality of Life Measure
(15D ©) [30, 31]; SF-36® [6, 27–29, 32–43]; Short Form

[29, 37, 44]; Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale
(GSRS) [44]; Fisk Fatigue Severity Scale (FFSS) [36, 42,
48]; Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI) [48]; VAS
[48–50]; the 5-Dimension Itch; [42, 43] the Pruritus nu￾merical rating scale; [51] the Hospital Anxiety and De￾pression Scale (HADS) [29]; Beck Depression Inventory
(BDI) [44, 52]; Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology
(IDS) [50]; Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) [6, 32];
Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia
(SADS) [52]; the Female Sexual Functioning Index (FSFI)
[34]; International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) [34];
Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS); [21] and Composite
Autonomic Symptom Scale 31 (COMPASS 31) [21].
Two other measures included: the Lifetime Drink￾ing History (LDH) and Health Habits and History
Questionnaires (HHHQ), which focused on alcohol
consumption and dietary intake.

Content comparison of included PROMs
The most frequent health domains (n = 6) included
across the measures were: fatigue, pain, physical func￾tioning, emotion, anxiety and general health.
Generic PROMs measured symptoms such as pain,
physical functioning, emotion, mental health and de￾pression. The disease- and symptom-specific PROMs
targeted aspects surrounding gastro intestinal symp￾toms, such as abdominal pain, or gastroduodenal
symptoms, sexual problems, somatic symptoms, de￾pression, mood disturbance, and vegetative features
(Additional file 3).
Quality assessment
Only three studies investigated measurement properties for
PROMs, two studies evaluated the NIDDK-QA [26, 28]
and one study evaluated the PSC PRO [43].
For NIDDK-QA, one validation study [28] included 76
Primary Biliary Cirrhosis (PBC) and 17 PSC patients. A
second study examined health status and QOL in pa￾tients with cholestatic disease before and after a liver
transplant. In this study the NIDDK-QA questionnaire
was administered to 65 Primary Biliary Cirrhosis and 92
PSC patients [26]. The PSC PRO validation study in￾cluded 102 patients with PSC who completed the PSC
PRO and four other questionnaires (SF-36, CLDQ,
PBC-40 and 5-D Itch Scale) using an ePRO website [43].
The results of the validation studies are presented in
Table 3 and summarised below.
Internal consistency
All the validation studies, appropriately calculated
Cronbach’s alpha to estimate reliability and internal
consistency. Reported Cronbach’s Alpha ranged from
0.87 to 0.94 for the NIDDK-QA and 0.86 to 0.94 for
the PSC PRO which suggests good internal consistency.
Criteria defined by the COSMIN tool meant that for the
NIDDK-QA the measurement properties were evaluated
as ‘poor’ in methodological quality in both studies pri￾marily because of small sample sizes and a lack of in￾formation regarding the proportion of missing items
and how missing items were managed. The PSC PRO
was rated as ‘fair’ due to the lack of explicit reporting
of missing items and sample size for unidemensionality
analysis.

Reliability
Kim et al. (2000) [28] assessed test-retest reliability of
the NIDDK-QA by administering the measure on two
separate occasions approximately 2 weeks apart in 19
patients. Although Pearson’s correlation was high at
0.80 (range 0.82 to 0.94), this measurement property
was evaluated as ‘poor’ methodological quality due to
the small sample size. For the PSC PRO, 53 patients
completed the PSC PRO a second time within 3
months and correlations between administrations was
high (range 0.70–0.88). The reliability of the PSC PRO
was rated as ‘fair’ due to this length of time between
administrations.
Validity
Kim et al. (2000) [28] assessed concurrent validity, by in￾vestigating the correlation between the NIDDK-QA and
SF-36. The authors postulated that observed correlations
between theoretically related domains such as physical
function and health satisfaction (r = 0.86 and 0.72 re￾spectively) demonstrated concurrent validity of the tool.
However, this measurement property was also evaluated
with ‘poor’ methodological quality owing to the absence
of details regarding the measurement properties of the
comparator scale (SF-36) in this population, and issues
with sample size and missing data.
Kim et al. (2000) [28] also measured discriminant val￾idity and information on the significant differences in
the item and domain level scores of NIDDK-QA re￾ported. Again, this property was evaluated with ‘poor’
methodological quality, secondary to issues regarding
sample size, proportion and handling of missing data.
For the PSC PRO, 26 PSC patients enrolled in cogni￾tive interviews for assessment of content validity, which
was rated as ‘excellent’ according to the COSMIN check￾list. An external validation cohort of 102 patients com￾pleted the PSC PRO along with SF-36, CLDQ, PBC-40
and 5-D Itch Scale; all correlations were statistically sig￾nificant. The structural validity measurement property
was rated as ‘fair’ due to the sample size in relation to
the number of items.
Evidence synthesis
Both NIDDK-QA studies reported limited information
regarding internal consistency, reliability and validity
(concurrent and discriminant). Using the COSMIN guid￾ance these properties were rated as indeterminate due to
the poor methodological ratings of both studies (Tables
4 and 5) (Additional file 4) [23]. The PSC PRO study
[43] had higher methodological quality compared to the
NIDDK-QA studies; however, as there was only one
study the level of evidence is limited.
Discussion
This review identified a total of 37 studies assessing 36
different PROMs used in patients with PSC; however,
only one of these tools was specifically developed for the
PSC population in accordance with FDA guidelines. The
rationale for PROM utilization in the included studies
varied. Most studies sought to measure the burden of
the disease using constructs such as HRQOL and symp￾tom severity; however, some studies examined the effect￾iveness of treatment, cost effectiveness and health utility.
No studies researched the use of real-time monitoring of
PROMs to directly inform PSC patient care in a routine
clinical setting. Only three studies evaluated the meas￾urement properties of PROMs in PSC patients: two
studies evaluated the NIDDK-QA [26, 28] and one study
evaluated the PSC PRO [43]. Currently, due to weakness
in the methodological quality, there is limited evidence
to support the use of these PROMs in the PSC popula￾tion; however the PSC PRO is a promising new measure
designed with patient input which requires further
validation.
Clinicians or researchers wishing to use PROMs in
PSC patients may consider use of both generic and dis￾ease specific measures. Choice of measurement selection
should be informed through consideration on psycho￾metric properties and patient input [53]. Generic mea￾sures such as the SF-36, although not formally validated
in PSC patients, are widely used and allow comparison
of the burden of PSC with other chronic disease, whilst
the EQ-5D and SF-6D may be used to provide estimates

of health utility to inform cost-effectiveness analysis
[54]. Use of the PSC PRO will provide a more detailed
assessment of symptoms and impact of symptoms rele￾vant to PSC patients and help identify patients with
varying disease severity [43, 55].
Although the PSC PRO has been developed with input
from patients with and without IBD, questions focused
on IBD symptoms appear fairly limited. This is import￾ant to note since 70–80% of PSC patients have
co-existent IBD, most frequently ulcerative colitis [3].
This is a long term comorbidity and can occur even after
a liver transplant [56]. The clinical course for patients
with PSC and concomitant IBD can be different when
compared to IBD or PSC alone [57]. PSC-IBD patients
have higher incidence of rectal sparing, colorectal neo￾plasia, pouchitis following ileal pouch anal anastomosis
(IPAA), pancolitis, and an overall poorer prognosis when
compared to patients with IBD alone [57, 58]. Thus,
PSC-IBD patients have additional symptoms and bur￾dens that impact on activities of daily living with the
consequential impact on HRQOL [59]. Additional use of
an IBD measure such as the IBS-QOL may therefore be
warranted [60].
Following further validation, the PSC PRO has poten￾tial for use in a number of ways to inform PSC patient
care. The PRO may be used in clinical trials to assess
the impact of new treatments or be used at the individ￾ual patient level in routine clinical practice to facilitate
shared decision making and tailor care to individual pa￾tient needs. This approach has been highly successful in
other settings such as cancer where routine monitoring
using ePROs reduced emergency room admissions by
7%, hospital admissions by 4%, helped patients stay on
treatment longer, improved patient quality of life by 31%
and increased survival on average by 5 months at low
cost [61, 62].
Strengths and limitations
This study is the first to undertake a systematic review
of PROMs used in PSC, in accordance with the PRISMA
[63] and COSMIN guidelines [64]. The use of COSMIN
criteria has permitted a structured and comprehensive
evaluation of the identified measures. However, the
NIDDK QA studies evaluated in this review were carried
out before the COSMIN guidance was available and at
the time of publication the level and detail of reporting
may have been deemed acceptable at that time. Another
important consideration for research studies or clinical
trials in rare diseases such as PSC are the small study
populations. When guidelines such as COSMIN judge
the quality of the methodology on sample sizes, it can
make it more difficult to demonstrate sound methodo￾logical quality when there are only small numbers of pa￾tients available for recruitment and validation of PROs
[65]. The use of international multi-centred studies may
be one approach to overcome the small numbers avail￾able in studies that aim to evaluate and develop PROs
for use in PSC in future studies.
Conclusion
In conclusion, a wide variety of PROMs are used to
assess HRQOL and symptom burden in patients with
PSC, but none have undergone comprehensive and
extensive validation in this patient group. The PSC
PRO is a promising new measure to assess symptoms
and symptom impact in PSC patients; however fur￾ther validation work is required. Collection of PROs
in PSC patients can provide valuable information in a
research setting and routine clinical practice to im￾prove PSC patient care.
