Abstract
Nitric oxide (NO) is an endogenous mediator of vascular tone and
host defence. Inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) results in preferential
pulmonary vasodilatation and lowers pulmonary vascular resis￾tance. The route of administration delivers NO selectively to
ventilated lung units so that its effect augments that of hypoxic
pulmonary vasoconstriction and improves oxygenation. This
‘Bench-to-bedside’ review focuses on the mechanisms of action of
iNO and its clinical applications, with emphasis on acute lung injury
and the acute respiratory distress syndrome. Developments in our
understanding of the cellular and molecular actions of NO may
help to explain the hitherto disappointing results of randomised
controlled trials of iNO.
Introduction
Nitric oxide (NO) is an important determinant of local blood
flow and is formed by the action of NO synthase (NOS) on
the semi-essential amino acid L-arginine in the presence of
molecular oxygen. Inhaled NO (iNO) results in preferential
pulmonary vasodilatation and lowers pulmonary vascular
resistance (PVR), augments hypoxic pulmonary vaso￾constriction (HPV), and improves oxygenation. These effects
are harnessed in the therapeutic applications of iNO to
patients with acute lung injury (ALI)/acute respiratory distress
syndrome (ARDS), to those with acute right ventricular failure
(RVF) complicating cardiac surgery or acute pulmonary
embolism, or in acute sickle chest crisis. Despite dramatic
physiological improvements that are often seen during the
therapeutic use of iNO, there remains a lack of evidence
concerning any beneficial effect on outcomes. This ‘Bench￾to-bedside’ review focuses on the mechanisms of action of
iNO and its clinical applications, with particular attention to
ALI and ARDS. Alterations in endogenous NO production
and the use of exogenous intravenous NO donors in acute
inflammatory conditions are beyond the scope of this review.
Administration of inhaled nitric oxide to adults
The licensed indication of iNO is restricted to persistent
pulmonary hypertension in neonates, yet most iNO is
administered for unlicensed indications. Pharmaceutical iNO
is available at a very high cost, and in light of this and
concerns over potential adverse effects of iNO, international
guidelines have been developed. An advisory board under the
auspices of the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine
and the European Association of Cardiothoracic Anaes￾thesiologists published its recommendations in 2005 [1].
Although this valuable project was sponsored by the
manufacturer of iNO (INO Therapeutics, now part of Ikaria
Holdings, Clinton, NJ, USA), the board stated that the
sponsor had no authorship or editorial control over the
content of the meetings or any subsequent publication.
iNO is administered most commonly to invasively ventilated
patients, although other routes are possible. To minimise the
admixture of high concentrations of oxygen with NO (risk of
nitrogen dioxide [NO2] formation), the NO/nitrogen mixture is
introduced into the inspiratory limb of the ventilator tubing as
near to the patient as possible. It is obligatory to monitor the
NO and NO2 concentrations, and although concentrations of
iNO administered clinically should not cause methemoglobi￾naemia, guidelines recommend that methemoglobin levels be
measured regularly. iNO administration reduces endogenous
NO production, and therefore rapid withdrawal of iNO can
cause a significant rebound pulmonary hypertension, but in
clinical practice, this can be avoided by gradual withdrawal [2].
There is marked variation in response to iNO between
patients [2] and in the same patient at different times. After
prolonged use, there is a leftward shift in the dose-response
curve such that, without regular titration against a therapeutic

goal, there is a risk of excessive iNO administration, associa￾ted with toxicity and loss of the therapeutic effect [3]. A survey
of 54 intensive care units in the UK revealed that the most
common usage was in treating ARDS, followed by pulmonary
hypertension [4], in keeping with results of a European survey
[5]. By contrast, a survey of therapeutic iNO usage in adult
patients from a single US centre (2000 to 2003)
demonstrated that the most common application was in the
treatment of RVF in patients after cardiac surgery and then, in
decreasing order, orthotopic heart transplantation, ventricular
assist device placement, medical patients (mostly with
refractory hypoxaemia), orthotopic lung transplantation, and for
hypoxaemia in other surgery [6].
Inhaled nitric oxide in acute lung injury and
acute respiratory distress syndrome
ALI and its extreme manifestation, ARDS, are characterised
by hypoxaemia despite high inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2
[arterial partial pressure of oxygen/fraction of inspired oxygen]
ratios of less than 300 mm Hg [40 kPa] and less than
200 mm Hg [27 kPa], respectively) in the context of a known
cause, evidence of pulmonary oedema, and the absence of
left atrial hypertension suggestive of a cardiogenic mecha￾nism [7]. Pathologically, there is alveolar inflammation and
injury leading to increased pulmonary capillary permeability
and resultant accumulation of alveolar fluid rich in protein and
inflammatory cells. This is manifest clinically as hypoxaemia,
ventilation-perfusion mismatch, physiological shunting,
atelectasis, and reduced compliance.
Since 1993, when the first investigation on the effects of iNO
on adult patients with ARDS was published [8], there have been
several randomised controlled trials (RCTs) examining the role
of iNO in ALI/ARDS (Table 1). The first systematic review and
meta-analysis [9] scrutinised five RCTs and found no beneficial
effect on mortality or ventilator-free days, but given wide
confidence intervals, the authors concluded that the effects
were uncertain. More recently, a meta-analysis considered 12
RCTs that included a total of 1,237 patients [10] and came to
conclusions that were more definitive: no benefit was seen on
mortality but there was improved oxygenation at 24 hours (13%
improvement in PaO2/FiO2 ratio) at the cost of increased risk of
renal dysfunction (relative risk 1.50, 95% confidence interval
1.11 to 2.02). Indeed, the authors highlight a trend to increased
mortality in patients receiving iNO and suggest that it not be
used in ALI/ARDS. However, findings from meta-analyses of
many small underpowered RCTs have significant limitations and
should be viewed as hypothesis-generating, not authoritative.
Further elucidation of why iNO may fail to improve patient
outcomes stems from understanding recent advances in our
knowledge of the biology of iNO, particularly those actions that
occur outside the pulmonary vasculature.
The biological action of inhaled nitric oxide
NO is a naturally occurring colourless and odourless gas. In
biological solutions, it is highly diffusible in water, with a half￾life of seconds. NO was regarded mainly as an environmental
pollutant prior to its identification as an endothelium-derived
relaxing factor and an important determinant of local blood
flow [11]. NO has an unpaired electron and, as such, reacts
very rapidly with other free radicals, certain amino acids, and
transition metal ions. In biological solutions, it is stabilised by
forming complexes.
The canonical source of endogenous NO is the action of
NOS on the semi-essential amino acid L-arginine in the
presence of molecular oxygen. Neuronal NOS was the first
isoform to be identified, followed by inducible NOS (iNOS or
NOS2), and finally endothelial NOS (eNOS or NOS3). iNOS
is calcium-independent and generates higher concentrations
of NO [12] than the other isoforms do. Its activity is
implicated in the pathogenesis of the vasoplegia that
characterises septic shock.
Exogenous NO is administered by controlled inhalation or
through intravenous administration of NO donors such as
sodium nitroprusside or glyceryl trinitrate. Traditionally, iNO
was thought to work exclusively in the lung, and thus be free
from remote or non-pulmonary effects, through immediate
inactivation by circulating haemoglobin (Hb). However, appre￾ciation of the remote effects of iNO has highlighted the impor￾tance of the actions of NO on circulating targets (Figure 1).
First, proteins including Hb and albumin contain reduced
sulphur (thiol) groups that react reversibly with NO. Previously,
NO was considered to react with oxyhaemoglobin to form
methemoglobin and nitrate or heme iron nitrosyl Hb and
thereby lose all vasodilating properties. However, a stable
derivate that retains vasodilatory properties is formed by a
reaction resulting in nitrosylation of a conserved cysteine
residue of the β subunit of Hb: S-nitrosylated-Hb (SNO-Hb).
This reaction is favoured in the presence of oxyhaemoglobin,
whereas binding of NO to the heme iron predominates in the
deoxygenated state [13]. As such, circulating erythrocytes
may effectively store and release NO peripherally in areas of
low oxygen tension, augmenting microvascular blood flow
and oxygen delivery via hypoxic vasodilation of systemic
vascular beds [14]. Thus, in isolation, NO can act as an
autocrine or paracrine mediator but when stabilised may exert
endocrine influences [15].
Second, in addition to de novo synthesis, supposedly inert
anions nitrate (NO3
–) and nitrite (NO2
–) can be recycled to
form NO. Indeed, it has been suggested that nitrite mediates
extra-pulmonary effects of iNO [16]. In the absence of
molecular oxygen (hypoxic environment), NOS cannot
produce NO and deoxyhaemoglobin catalyses NO release
from nitrite, thus potentially also providing a hypoxia-specific
vasodilatory effect. Given that effects of iNO are mediated in
part by S-nitrolysation of circulating proteins, therapies aiming
at directly increasing S-nitrosothiols have been developed. In
a small observational study, inhaled ethyl nitrite safely

reduced PVR without systemic side effects in persistent pul￾monary hypertension of the newborn [17]. In animal models,
pulmonary vasodilatation was maximal in hypoxia and had pro￾longed duration of action after cessation of administration [18].
When inhaled with high concentrations of oxygen, gaseous
NO slowly forms the toxic product NO2. Other potential
reactions include nitration (addition of NO2+), nitrosation
(addition of NO+), or nitrosylation (addition of NO). Further￾more, NO may react with reactive oxygen species such as
superoxide to form reactive nitrogen species (RNS) such as
peroxynitrite (ONOO–), a powerful oxidant that can decompose
further to yield NO2 and hydroxyl radicals. NO is therefore
potentially cytotoxic, and covalent nitration of tyrosine in
proteins by RNS has been used as a marker of oxidative stress.
Cardiovascular effects
NO activates soluble guanylyl cyclase by binding to its heme
group, and consequently cyclic guanosine 3′5′-monophosphate
(cGMP) is formed, in turn activating its associated protein
kinase. This protein kinase decreases the sensitivity of myosin
to calcium-induced contraction and lowers the intracellular
calcium concentration by activating calcium-sensitive potas￾sium channels and inhibiting the release of calcium from the
sarcoplasmic reticulum. These changes cause smooth
muscle cells (SMCs) to relax. iNO causes relaxation of SMCs
in the pulmonary vasculature with a resultant decrease in
PVR. The right ventricle (RV) is exquisitely sensitive to
afterload, and if RV function is impaired, it may respond
favourably to the decreased afterload, improving cardiac
output. iNO must be used with caution in the presence of left
ventricular impairment as the decrease in PVR may permit
increased right ventricular output to a greater extent than the
left ventricle can accommodate and this may excessively
increase the left atrial pressure, causing or exacerbating
pulmonary oedema. Similarly, pulmonary oedema can result
from disproportionate vasodilatation of the pre-capillary
compared with post-capillary vasculature, causing an
increased transpulmonary gradient.
iNO augments the normal physiological mechanism of HPV
and improves ventilation-perfusion matching and systemic
oxygenation (Figure 2). In the absence of hypoxaemia being
caused by ventilation-perfusion mismatching and HPV, the
beneficial effects of iNO on oxygenation are severely limited.
Indeed, experimental data confirm that intravenously
administered vasodilators worsen oxygenation by counter￾acting HPV [3]. Further signs of the extent of non-pulmonary
effects of iNO are increased renal blood flow and improved
hepatic tissue oxygenation [14].
Non-cardiovascular effects relevant to lung injury
Neutrophils are important cellular mediators of ALI. Limiting
neutrophil adherence experimentally and production of oxida￾tive species and lytic enzymes reduce lung injury. In
neonates, prolonged iNO diminished neutrophil-mediated
oxidative stress [19], and in animal models, neutrophil
deformability and CD18 expression were reduced [20] with
resultant decreases in adhesion and migration [21]. These
changes limit damage to the alveolar-capillary membrane and
the accumulation of protein-rich fluid within the alveoli.
Platelet activation and aggregation, microthrombosis, and
intra-alveolar deposition contribute to ALI. iNO attenuates the
procoagulant activity in animal models of ALI [22] and a
similar effect is seen both in patients with ALI [23] and in
healthy volunteers [23,24]. In patients with ALI, decreased
surfactant activity in the alveoli contributes to impaired
pulmonary function and is of prognostic significance [25].

Figure 1
New paradigm of inhaled nitric oxide (NO) action. This figure illustrates the interactions between inhaled NO and the contents of the pulmonary
capillaries. Previously, NO was considered to be inactivated by haemoglobin (Hb), and now it is recognised that, both through the interaction of Hb
with NO and the formation of S-nitrosylated-Hb (SNO-Hb) and through the nitrosylation of plasma proteins and the formation of nitrite, the inhaled
NO has effects downstream to the lungs. SMC, smooth muscle cell.

Although a major cause of diminished surfactant activity is the
presence of alveolar exudate, iNO may have deleterious
effects on the function of surfactant proteins through the
alteration in their structure by reactions with RNS [26].
Finally, prolonged exposure to NO in experimental models
impairs cellular respiration [27] and may contribute to cyto￾pathic dysoxia.
The failure of iNO to improve outcome in ALI/ARDS is
therefore potentially due to several factors. First, patients with
ALI/ARDS do not die of refractory hypoxaemia but of multi￾organ failure. The actions of NO are mainly considered to
have their beneficial effects on oxygenation and are not
expected to improve the outcome of multi-organ failure.
Indeed, any beneficial effects of iNO on oxygenation may be
abrogated by detrimental systemic effects mediated by
downstream products of iNO. Second, ALI/ARDS is a hetero￾geneous condition with diverse causes, potentially requiring
specific interventions to affect outcome. Finally, the use of
iNO without frequent dose titration risks inadvertent overdose
with increased unwanted systemic effects without further
cardiopulmonary benefits.
Other clinical uses of inhaled nitric oxide

failure
RVF may develop when there is abnormally elevated PVR
and/or impaired RV perfusion. Table 2 lists common causes
of acute RVF. The RV responds relatively poorly to inotropic
agents but is exquisitely sensitive to afterload reduction.

Reducing PVR will offload a struggling ventricle with
beneficial effects on cardiac output and therefore oxygen
delivery. In the context of high RV afterload with low systemic
pressures or when there is a limitation of flow within the right
coronary artery [28], RV failure will ensue and potentially
trigger a downward spiral, as diagrammatically represented in
Figure 3.
iNO is commonly used when RV failure complicates cardiac
surgery. Cardiopulmonary bypass per se causes diminished
endogenous NO production [29].
There is marked variation in response to iNO between
patients [30] and in the same patient at different times. After
prolonged use, there is a leftward shift in the dose-response
curve such that, without regular titration against a therapeutic
goal, there is a risk of excessive iNO administration that is
associated with toxicity and loss of the therapeutic effect [31].
Cardiac transplantation may be complicated by pulmonary
hypertension and RVF that are improved with iNO [32]. Early
ischaemia-reperfusion injury after lung transplantation
manifests clinically as pulmonary oedema and is a cause of
significant morbidity and mortality [33,34]. Although iNO is a
useful therapy in this circumstance [35], it did not prevent
ischaemia-reperfusion injury in clinical lung transplantation
[36].
iNO has been used successfully in patients with cardiogenic
shock and RVF associated with acute myocardial infarction
[37,38]. Similarly, iNO was valuable in patients with acute
RVF following acute pulmonary venous thromboembolism
accompanied by significant haemodynamic compromise [39].
No systematic evaluation of iNO and its effect on clinical
outcome has been conducted in these conditions.
Acute chest crises of sickle cell disease
Acute chest crises are the second most common cause of
hospital admission in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD)
and are responsible for 25% of all related deaths [40]. Acute
chest crises are manifest by fever, respiratory symptoms or
chest pain, and new pulmonary infiltrate on chest radio￾graphy. Pulmonary infection, fat emboli, and pulmonary
infarction due to vaso-occlusion are the major contributory
factors. Haemolysis of sickled erythrocytes releases Hb into
the plasma, where it generates reactive oxygen species and
reacts with NO [41]. In SCD, the scavenging systems that
would usually remove circulating free Hb are saturated. Free
Hb depletes NO, leading to endothelial cell dysfunction.
Haemolysis also releases arginase 1 into plasma, depleting
the vital substrate for NO production, arginine [42]. Further￾more, secondary pulmonary hypertension is common in adults
with SCD, with estimates of prevalence ranging from 30% to
56%. Given the physiological rationale for the use of iNO and
supportive data from animal studies, there have been several
cases [43-45].
iNO has been used successfully in patients with cardiogenic
shock and RVF due to acute myocardial infarction [46].
Similarly, iNO was valuable in patients with acute RVF due to
acute pulmonary venous thromboembolism accompanied by
significant haemodynamic compromise [47]. Thus far, iNO
has failed to demonstrate either persistent improvements in
physiology or beneficial effects on any accepted measure of
outcome in clinical trials (other than its licensed indication in
neonates). Therefore, iNO sits alongside interventions such
as prone positioning and high-frequency oscillatory ventilation
in that they improve oxygenation without demonstrated
improvements in patient outcome and therefore are usually
reserved for refractory hypoxaemia.
Potential problems in designing and conducting RCTs in the
efficacy of iNO are numerous. Blinded trials will be difficult to
conduct as the effects of iNO are immediately apparent.
Recruitment will be limited as some of these indications are
uncommon and rapidly life-threatening with little time for
consent/assent or randomisation. Clinicians with experience
of the efficacy of iNO may not have sufficient clinical

the expense of iNO, industry funding is likely to be necessary
and this might both cast doubt on the independence of the
trial results and exclude trials that may adversely influence
sales.
iNO remains an important tool in the intensivist’s armamen￾tarium of rescue therapies for refractory hypoxaemia. iNO has
a well-established role in managing complications of cardiac
surgery and in heart/lung transplantation. There is a place for
iNO in the management of ALI/ARDS, acute sickle chest
crisis, acute RV failure, and acute pulmonary embolism, but it
is likely to remain a rescue therapy.
