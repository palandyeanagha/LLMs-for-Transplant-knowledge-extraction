Abstract
The characteristics of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) accompanying chronic liver disease (CLD) were
investigated in ICH patients hospitalized between 1998 and 2008 divided into the CLD group (55 ICHs in
49 patients) and the idiopathic group without CLD (668 ICHs in 648 patients). The CLD group included a
subgroup with liver cirrhosis (LC). Age, sex, history of hypertension, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score
on admission, and hematoma locations were reviewed. Outcomes on discharge and causes of in￾hospital death were also studied. Factors associated with life prognosis in CLD patients were investigat￾ed using uni- and multivariate analyses. History of hypertension and deep cerebral hemorrhage were
less frequent in the LC subgroup compared to the idiopathic group. Distributions of GCS scores on ad￾mission were not significantly different, but incidence of in-hospital death was significantly higher in
the CLD group than in the idiopathic group. LC was an independent prognostic factor for CLD patients,
but hematoma enlargement was not. Death primarily due to ICH was less frequent in the CLD group
than in the idiopathic group. In conclusion, hemostatic disorders seemed to be related to site of hemor￾rhage, but not to life prognosis in the CLD group. Prognosis was mainly worsened by non-neurological
complications.

Introduction
Liver cirrhosis (LC) often results in coagulopathy
and thrombocytopenia, and causes various hemosta￾tic problems. Some studies have examined the
relationships between intracerebral hemorrhage
(ICH) and LC,1,6) and abnormalities in laboratory
data reflecting liver function reportedly correlate
with ICH volume and rebleeding.3,4,11,12) Few investi￾gations have focused on the characteristics of ICH
in patients with chronic liver disease (CLD). This
study compared ICH between patients with and
without CLD in terms of baseline characteristics,
level of consciousness at onset, hematoma location,
and prognosis. We also analyzed factors affecting
life prognosis in ICH patients with CLD.
Materials and Methods
We reviewed the hospital records of patients with
ICH for the period between April 1998 and Septem￾ber 2008 in the Department of Neurosurgery at
Dokkyo Medical University Koshigaya Hospital.
This series did not include traumatic ICH patients or
those with aneurysmal rupture. We also excluded
cases with hemorrhagic complications after cerebral
infarction. Potential predisposing factors for ICH
were then examined. Patients who had taken anti￾platelet drugs or anticoagulants, who suffered any
hematological diseases causing thrombocytopenia
or coagulopathy, with hemorrhagic cerebrovascular
anomalies such as arteriovenous malformation, or
who had undergone hemodialysis for chronic renal
failure were excluded from this study.
The remaining patients were divided into two

groups: patients with CLD; and patients without
CLD. Patients with CLD were defined as patients
who had been diagnosed with chronic hepatitis or
LC prior to ICH, or who were diagnosed with such
by hepatologists after admission. We included
patients who showed abnormal laboratory data for
aspartate aminotransferase (À50 IU/l), alanine
aminotransferase (À50 IU/l), or g-glutamyl trans￾ferase (À60 IU/l) and with alcoholic consumption of
Æ400 g/week for Æ10 years. Alcohol intake was cal￾culated according to the method described previous￾ly.8) Patients without any CLD were defined as show￾ing idiopathic ICH. The CLD group included a sub￾group with LC diagnosed by a hepatologist.
We reviewed data for age, sex, and presence of
hypertension as baseline characteristics. Hyperten￾sion was diagnosed if the patient had a history of
taking antihypertensive medication or prior diagno￾sis by a physician. We identified causes for CLD as
far as possible, basically according to the diagnosis
by hepatologists. The Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)
was used to evaluate neurological severity on admis￾sion.
Hematoma locations were classified into the puta￾men, thalamus, caudate nucleus, cerebellum, brain￾stem, cerebral lobes, and lateral ventricles. Patients
with ICH involving the putamen, thalamus, or cau￾date were defined as the deep cerebral hemorrhage
group.2,9) If hematoma spread over two areas or
more, the location was decided according to the site
at which hematoma volume was largest on comput￾ed tomography (CT). We defined the lateral ventricle
type as absence of evident intraparenchymal hema￾toma, with hematoma apparent only in the ventri￾cles on CT.
Outcomes at discharge were estimated using the
Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS), as the modified
Rankin scale had not been used in the earlier years
covered by this study. We mainly focused on life
prognosis of the patient, in terms of in-hospital
death. We assumed that variables representing pos￾sible risk factors for death (GOS grade 1) were: age;
GCS on admission; deep cerebral hemorrhage; ICH
in the posterior fossa; hypertension; alcoholic liver
disease; LC; and hematoma enlargement after ad￾mission. For the analysis, we classified GCS scores
as º11.5 or Æ11.5. Hematoma enlargement was de￾fined according to descriptions in the record of the
patient. We reviewed the records for in-hospital
deaths, identified the cause of death, and judged
whether the patient primarily died of ICH, including
development of hydrocephalus.
The x2 test and Student's t test were used for group
comparison. Odds ratios and 95% confidence inter￾vals were obtained using univariate logistic regres￾sion in relation to risk factors for in-hospital death.
A forward stepwise method was used to construct a
multivariate logistic regression model with the in￾clusion variables from univariate analysis showing
values of p º 0.20. All statistical calculations were
performed using SPSS version 16.0 statistical
software (SPSS, Chicago, Illinois, USA). Values of
p Ã 0.05 were considered statistically significant.
This study was approved by the ethics committee
of Dokkyo Medical University and in accordance
with the Declaration of Helsinki. Informed consent
was obtained from each patient or their authorized
guardian.
Results
A total of 834 ICHs in 803 patients were identified.
We excluded 111 hemorrhages in 106 patients from
this study because of predisposing factors. The sub￾ject population thus comprised 697 patients with
723 ICHs. A total of 55 ICHs in 49 patients with CLD
were identified. The LC subgroup comprised 23
patients with 25 ICHs. The remaining 648 patients
showed 668 ICHs (idiopathic ICH). Causes of CLD
are shown in Fig. 1. About half of the cases in our
series were due to hepatitis B or C virus infection.
Age and sex as baseline characteristics were com￾pared between the CLD and idiopathic types, and
also between the LC and idiopathic types. No sig￾nificant differences were found (Table 1). Data on
hypertension as a baseline characteristic are also
shown in Table 1. We excluded 144 ICHs because
we could not obtain any information on the episode
from the clinical records. The remaining cases were
used for analysis. Hypertension was significantly
less frequent in CLD patients compared to
idiopathic ICH patients (p º 0.001). Frequency of
hypertension was also significantly lower in LC
patients than in idiopathic patients.
Hematoma locations are shown in Fig. 2. Ratios of
locations classified into seven categories did not
differ significantly between CLD, LC, and idiopathic
patients. When locations were classified as deep
cerebral hemorrhage or not, the ratio of deep

cerebral hemorrhage was significantly lower in the
LC group than in the idiopathic ICH group (p º
0.05).
Figure 3 shows the distribution of GCS scores for
each group. Median GCS scores in the CLD, LC, and
idiopathic groups were 11.5, 12, and 13, respec￾tively. No significant differences were apparent. Ra￾tios of patients with GCS score º11.5 also showed
no significant difference.
When outcomes on discharge were classified as
death (GOS grade1) or not, ratio of death was sig￾nificantly larger in the CLD and LC groups than in
the idiopathic ICH group (p º 0.001; Fig. 4A).
Causes of in-hospital death were reviewed in the
clinical records. The ratio of death primarily due to
ICH was very high (100/119) in the idiopathic ICH
group. Conversely, ratios in the CLD group and LC
subgroup were 13/22 and 7/13, respectively (Fig. 4B).
Significant differences thus existed between
idiopathic ICH and CLD, and between idiopathic
ICH and LC (p º 0.05). Among CLD patients, only 1
patient died due to hematoma enlargement. Nine of
the CLD group died from non-neurological compli￾cations, including disseminated intravascular
coagulopathy or multiple organ failure triggered by

infection in 3 patients, acute respiratory failure due
to pneumonia or lung edema in 4, acute circulatory
failure in a patient with massive ascites, and sudden
death in a patient with severe hepatic failure.
Table 2 shows the results of univariate and mul￾tivariate logistic analyses of relationships between
the selected variables and in-hospital death for ICH
patients with CLD. Only GCS score º11.5 and ICH
in the posterior fossa showed significant relation￾ships to in-hospital death in univariate analysis. For
multivariate logistic analysis, we selected 4 varia￾bles: GCS º11.5; age; LC; and ICH in the posterior
fossa. GCS º11.5, age, and LC were identified as in￾dependent predictors of in-hospital death in CLD
patients (Table 2).
Discussion
ICH is more frequently found in patients with liver
dysfunction than other types of stroke.1,3) However,
epidemiological data concerning the incidence of
ICH among patients with liver dysfunction com￾pared to the general population appear to be lacking.
In our series, hypertension was less frequent in the
CLD group and LC subgroup than in the idiopathic
ICH group. This may suggest that patients with liver
dysfunction are more vulnerable to developing ICH
than those without such background pathology.
Some reports have noted that ICH locations in
patients with specific hemostatic problems differ
from those in patients with general hypertensive
ICH. ICH associated with anti-coagulant administra￾tion is frequently located in the cerebellum,2,10)
whereas the incidence of lobar ICH is high in
patients with thrombocytopenia.5) Conversely, hy￾pertension in general is reportedly associated with
deep cerebral hemorrhage.7,9) In our study, the inci￾dence of non-deep cerebral hemorrhage, which in￾cludes cerebellar and lobar ICH, was significantly
higher in the LC subgroup than in the idiopathic
ICH group. We suspect that hemostatic disorders
are involved in the site of bleeding among LC
patients.
Hematoma volumes reportedly increase with
greater abnormality of laboratory data for liver func￾tion.3,11) We did not measure hematoma volumes, in￾stead estimating neurological severity using GCS on
admission. The result showed no significant correla-

tion with liver dysfunction. Liver dysfunction in￾cluding hemostatic dysfunction may not be as im￾portant in determining the level of consciousness at
the onset.
Prognosis reportedly becomes worse with worsen￾ing laboratory data for liver functions.3) The severity
of LC is also associated with patient outcomes.6) Our
study showed significantly increased in-hospital
deaths for both CLD and LC compared to idiopathic
ICH. Considering that GCS on admission in CLD
patients was not significantly different from that of
idiopathic ICH patients, we speculate that patients
with CLD tend to deteriorate after admission and
subsequently show poorer prognosis than idiopathic
ICH patients. We postulate two reasons for this:
hematoma enlargement after admission; and de￾velopment of complications not directly related to
ICH. Six of 117 patients with ICH experienced
rebleeding.12) All six showed liver dysfunction, and
just two displayed clinical worsening. In our series,
only 1 patient in the CLD group died due to hemato￾ma enlargement. Hematoma enlargement was not a
significant predictor of in-hospital death in our
univariate analysis. We do not think that hematoma
enlargement or rebleeding are major factors predict￾ing worsening condition in patients with CLD.
Our multivariate analysis showed LC, along with
age and GCS score on admission, as independent
predictive factors for in-hospital death in CLD
patients. LC is associated not only with hemostatic
disorders, but also with other various types of dis￾orders, such as pathologies involving the immuno￾logical and endocrinological systems. The ratio of
in-hospital deaths unrelated to ICH was significantly
higher in the CLD group and LC subgroup compared
to the idiopathic ICH group in our study. Non￾neurological complications triggered and aggravat￾ed by liver dysfunction are important factors in de￾termining the life prognosis of CLD patients.
Blood pressure was intensively controlled in both
ICH patients with CLD and ICH patients with
idiopathic ICH. Only three LC patients showing se￾vere thrombocytopenia and elongation of prothrom￾bin time underwent platelet and/or frozen fresh plas￾ma transfusion. We do not think such hemostatic
treatments are always necessary, but accurate evalu￾ation of liver functions is indispensable to prevent
hematoma enlargement. Patients with CLD are sus￾ceptible to various types of disorders. Cooperation
with hepatologists and other medical staff is im￾portant when treating ICH accompanied by CLD.
This retrospective study shows that deep cerebral
hemorrhage is less frequent in LC patients.
Hemostatic disorders may be involved in determin￾ing hematoma locations in such patients. Liver dys￾function was not correlated with level of conscious￾ness on admission, but with outcomes on discharge.
We think that this was mainly because patients with
CLD are at greater risk of non-neurological compli￾cations than idiopathic ICH patients.
