Abstract
Background: Lung transplantation is the only treatment modality
that provides a survival advantage in pulmonary fibrosis, but many
patients deemed suitable will die awaiting lung transplantation.
While donor organ shortage undoubtedly contributes to this, late
referral to the transplant centre may also play a role. This study
investigates factors influencing the chance of patients with
pulmonary fibrosis reaching lung transplantation.
Methods: A single-centre retrospective review of patient
demographic data, assessment investigations and subsequent
clinical outcomes was performed for patients with pulmonary
fibrosis assessed for lung transplantation over a 5-year period.
Results: Between March 1999 and March 2004, 129 patients with
pulmonary fibrosis underwent formal transplant assessment. Sixty-
nine were accepted and listed for lung transplantation. Of these, 17
were transplanted, 37 died while waiting, 4 were removed from the
list and 11 were still waiting at the conclusion of the study. The
median waiting time on the list for those transplanted was 103 days
(range 6–904) compared with 125 days (range 2–547) for those
who died while on the list (p = 0.65). There was no significant
difference in age, spirometry, total lung capacity, gas transfer
measures or 6 min walk distance between those who died waiting
and those transplanted. However, time from onset of symptoms to
transplant assessment was significantly shorter in those who died on
the waiting list (median 29 months (range 2–120)) than in those
transplanted (median 46 months (range 6–204), p = 0.037).
Conclusion: Patients with pulmonary fibrosis who died awaiting
transplantation had similar disease severity at assessment as those
who achieved transplantation. However, the interval between
symptom onset and transplant referral was significantly shorter in
those who died while on the waiting list, suggesting they had more
rapidly progressive disease. The rate of disease progression appears
to be a more sensitive indicator for transplantation referral than any


single physiological measure of disease severity and should act as
an important trigger for early transplant referral.
