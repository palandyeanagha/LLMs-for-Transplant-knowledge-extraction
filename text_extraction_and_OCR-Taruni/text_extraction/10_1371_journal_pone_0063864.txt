Abstract
Background: To report the feasibility, efficacy, and toxicity of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for the treatment of
portal vein tumor thrombosis (PVTT) and/or inferior vena cava tumor thrombosis (IVCTT) in patients with advanced
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
Materials and methods: Forty-one patients treated with SBRT using volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) for HCC with
PVTT/IVCTT between July 2010 and May 2012 were analyzed. Of these, 33 had PVTT and 8 had IVCTT. SBRT was designed to
target the tumor thrombosis and deliver a median total dose of 36 Gy (range, 30–48 Gy) in six fractions during two weeks.
Results: The median follow-up was 10.0 months. At the time of analysis, 15 (36.6%) achieved complete response, 16 (39.0%)
achieved partial response, 7 (17.1%) patients were stable, and three (7.3%) patients showed progressive disease. No
treatment-related Grade 4/5 toxicity was seen within three months after SBRT. One patient had Grade 3 elevation of
bilirubin. The one-year overall survival rate was 50.3%, with a median survival of 13.0 months. The only independent
predictive factor associated with better survival was response to radiotherapy.
Conclusions: VMAT-based SBRT is a safe and effective treatment option for PVTT/IVCTT in HCC. Prospective randomized
controlled trials are warranted to validate the role of SBRT in these patients.

Introduction
Portal vein tumor thrombosis (PVTT) and inferior vena cava
tumor thrombosis (IVCTT) are common complications in patients
with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Despite im￾provement in the survival of HCC, the prognosis of patients with
PVTT/IVCTT remains poor, with a median survival of only
approximately three months without treatment [1,2]. PVTT is
commonly associated with portal vein hypertension, tumor
dissemination, and deterioration of liver function, which then
limits the application of surgical resection or transarterial
chemoembolization (TACE) on HCC [3,4].
As no standard treatment modality has been established for
HCC with tumor thrombosis, radiotherapy can be considered as
an alternative treatment. With the development of radiation
techniques such as three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy
(3DCRT), intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), and stereo￾tactic body radiotherapy (SBRT), high-dose radiation can be safely
delivered to liver tumors without resulting in serious complications
[5]. Several studies have reported the application of 3DCRT in
the treatment of HCC with PVTT, which has shown encouraging
results in local control and survival [6–13]. However, few studies
have investigated the efficacy of SBRT for the treatment of
PVTT/IVCTT. In addition, the published reports have been
limited to small case series, making it difficult to carry out reliable
analysis [14,15].
The purpose of the current study was to report our institutional
experience with a relatively large group of patients and to evaluate
the feasibility, efficacy, and toxicity of SBRT for PVTT/IVCTT
in HCC.
Materials and Methods
Ethics statement
This study was approved by our Institutional Review Boards
(IRBs) for Cancer Center, Sun Yat-sen University. Written
informed consents were obtained from all the patients in
accordance with the regulations of IRBs.
Patient population
We retrospectively reviewed the records of 41 advanced HCC
patients with PVTT and/or IVCTT who had received SBRT
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 May 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 5 | e63864

between July 2010 and May 2012 at our institution. The inclusion
criteria were as follows: (1) patients between 20–70 years of age; (2)
histopathologically or radiologically diagnosed as having HCC
with PVTT/IVCTT, unresectable or medically unsuitable for
resection; (3) Child-Pugh class A liver function; (4) more than 800
cc of uninvolved liver; (5) no history of radiotherapy for the liver;
and (6) Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) perfor￾mance status scale #2. Patients who had distant metastasis were
excluded from this study. PVTT/IVCTT was diagnosed on the
basis of a filling defect in the PV/IVC on contrast-enhanced CT
or MRI.
Patient and tumor characteristics are listed in Table 1. The
median age at diagnosis of PVTT/IVCTT was 54 years (range,
27–70 years). Thirty-four patients (82.9%) had hepatitis B
infection, and only one (2.4%) has hepatitis C. Tumor thrombosis
involved the first or second order PV branches in 16 patients
(39.0%), the main trunk of PV in 17 patients (41.5%), and IVC in
8 patients (19.5%), respectively. For the tumor thrombosis located
in both branches and the main trunk of PV (11 patients), we
categorized the tumor thrombosis as main trunk.
In terms of treatment before radiotherapy, 25 patients had
received median 2 cycles of TACE (range, 1–6 cycles) with or
without radiofrequency ablation (RFA). Ten patients had been
treated with resection for intrahepatic tumors before the occur￾rence of tumor thrombosis. For the other 6 patients, RFA was
performed as the initial treatment before SBRT. Regarding the
treatment of TACE, hepatic artery infusion chemotherapy was
performed using carboplatin 300 mg; next, chemolipiodolization
was performed using epirubicin 50 mg and mitomycin 8 mg
mixed with 5 mL of lipidol. Of the 41 patients, 14 (34.1%)
received oral sorafenib (400 mg bid) at least one month before
radiation. The targeted therapy was continued during and after
radiotherapy until disease progression.
Radiation treatment
Patients were immobilized with vacuum bags in the supine
position with the arms raised above the head during simulation.
Contrast-enhanced four-dimensional computed tomography
(4DCT) scans were acquired at 2.5-mm slice thickness on a 16-
slice positron emission tomography PET/CT (GE Medical
Systems, Waukesha, WI) during uncoached, quiet breathing [16].
The gross tumor volume (GTV) represented the tumor
thrombosis visualized on the CT images, and/or near primary
liver lesions and/or positive abdominal lymph node (LN)
metastasis. Internal target volume (ITV) was defined as the
combined volume of GTVs in the multiple 4DCT phases. An
isotropic margin of 0.6 cm was added to ITV to account for
interfractional motion variability and daily setup errors in order to
generate a planning target volume (PTV). Organs at risk (OARs)
included the liver, kidneys, stomach, small intestine, and spinal
cord. Normal liver volume was defined as the total liver volume
minus the GTV.
Volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) was planned for an
Elekta Synergy accelerator (MLCi2, 80 leaves; width, 1 cm) with 8
MV photons. VMAT planning was performed using Monaco TPS
(CMS, Elekta, version 3.0) and consisted of a single 360u arc,
which uses simultaneous variation of gantry rotational speed,
MLC leaf positions, and dose rate to optimize the dose
distribution, as previously described [17].
The median prescription dose was 36 Gy (range, 30–48 Gy) to
PTV in six fractions administered over two weeks. Planning
objectives for the PTVs aimed to limit the minimal and maximal
doses to 90% and 110% of the prescribed dose. Dose-volume
planning objectives for the OARs were defined as follows: normal
liver, mean dose #18 Gy; stomach, maximal dose #35 Gy; small
intestine, maximal dose #30 Gy; bilateral kidney, mean dose #18
Gy; and spinal cord, maximal dose ,27 Gy. For the stomach and
small intestine, the maximal dose was expressed as D0.5cc.
Regarding the quality of VMAT delivery and the agreement
between the dose calculations and treatment, the VMAT plans
were verified dosimetrically using a Delta 4 phantom (ScandiDos,
Uppsala, Sweden) before treatment, as described by Bedford et al.
[18]. The gamma evaluation criterion was 63% of 2 Gy and the

distance to agreement was 3 mm, as commonly used in the clinic.
In each fraction of SBRT delivery, online couch adjustment using
kilovoltage cone-beam CT scans was performed for isocenter
verification.
Evaluation
Patients were assessed for toxicities on a weekly basis during
SBRT and once every three months thereafter. Treatment￾associated acute and late toxicities were scored according to the
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE;
version 3.0). Tumor response was assessed using the modified
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (mRECIST)
criteria [19]. The response of PVTT/IVCTT to SBRT was
evaluated by contrast-enhanced spiral CT scans performed three
months after completion of radiotherapy. Biochemical response
was assessed in patients with elevated alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level
before radiotherapy and defined by either a $50% reduction or
normalization of the AFP level within three months after SBRT.
Follow-up and statistical analysis
The cutoff date for the last follow-up was November 30, 2012,
for the censored data analysis. The overall survival (OS) was
calculated from the start of radiotherapy to the date of either death
or the last follow-up visit. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to
analyze the OS, the log-rank test was used to examine group
differences, and a Cox regression model was used for multivariate
analysis. All statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS
software package (version 13.0; SPSS Inc., Chicago). A P value of
,0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Results
Technical and dosimetric findings
The mean GTV and PTV volumes were 65.4647.9 and
201.86115.0 cc, respectively. The mean normal liver volume was
1252.66257.6 cc. The planning objectives were reached in all
VMAT plans and all cases completed the planned radiotherapy.
The mean doses administered to the normal liver and bilateral
kidney were 12.762.6 and 3.961.8 Gy, respectively. The
maximal dose to the serial OARs were as follows: 25.866.7 Gy
for stomach, 17.5611.3 Gy for small intestine, and 16.665.2 Gy
for spinal cord. The number of monitor units (MU) per fraction for
VMAT plans was 12706189, and the average effective treatment

time was 3.960.6 min. The average gamma evaluation passing
rate of VMAT delivery was 98.661.2%.
Tumor response
Evaluating response according to mRECIST criteria, complete
response (CR) was achieved in 15 (36.6%); partial response (PR),
in 16 (39.0%); stable disease (SD), in 7 (17.1%); and progressive
disease (PD), in 3 patients (7.3%), yielding an objective response
rate (CR + PR) of 75.6%. Typical presentations before and after
SBRT are illustrated in Figure 1. Of the 30 patients with elevated
AFP levels before radiotherapy, 23 patients (76.7%) exhibited
$50% reduction in the AFP levels within three months after
SBRT.
Follow-up and survival
Three months after completion of SBRT, 15 patients received
additional 1–4 cycles of TACE and 5 patients received further
RFA because of the restoration of PV patency or multiple
intrahepatic lesions. Three patients underwent surgical resection
3.2 months, 4.1months, and 5.9 months after radiotherapy,
respectively. Two of them died from surgery-related complications
and the other one patient is still alive without evidence of disease.
The median follow-up period was 10.0 months (range, 3.6–25.3
months). During follow-up, PD was noted in 28 patients (14 with
intrahepatic progression, 2 with distant metastasis, and 12 patients
with both). The majority (12/14) of intrahepatic progression
occurred outside the treated volume. Lungs were the most

frequent site of distant metastasis followed by the brain and
adrenal gland.
Nineteen patients (46.3%) survived at the time of the current
analysis, including eight without disease and 11 with disease
progression. The median survival time for the whole group was
13.0 months (95% CI, 7.1–18.8 months), with a 1-year OS rate of
50.3% (Fig. 2). The median survival of PVTT in branches, PVTT
in main trunk, and IVCTT were 23.9 months (95% CI, 14.6–33.3
months), 9.1 months (95% CI, 5.1–13.0 months), and 9.2 months
(95% CI, 2.6–15.8 months), respectively (Fig. 3).
Predictors of survival
Univariate analysis revealed that limited intrahepatic tumor
(#1), well-controlled intrahepatic lesion, absence of LN metastasis,
PVTT in branches, higher radiation dose ($36 Gy), and response
to radiotherapy were favorable prognostic indicators of survival
(Table 2). In the multivariate analysis, response to radiotherapy
was the only independent predictive factor associated with better
OS (P = 0.043). The median OS of responders and non-responders
were 18.0 months (95% CI, 11.8–24.2 months) and 6.0 months
(95% CI, 5.8–6.2 months), respectively (P,0.0001; Fig. 4).
Toxicity
As shown in Table 3, no treatment-related Grade 4 or 5 acute
toxicity was seen within three months after SBRT. Only one
patient (2.4%) showed Grade 3 elevation of bilirubin. Grade 1
nausea/vomiting was the most common toxicity encountered
during SBRT. Three patients (7.3%) developed late toxicity: one
patient exhibited Grade 1 liver enzyme elevation, and two patients
experienced Grade 2 decrease in their platelet counts.
Discussion
SBRT has shown encouraging rates of local control and low
toxicity for HCC and hepatic metastasis [20,21]. However, very
few studies have investigated SBRT for PVTT/IVCTT in HCC
patients. The efficacy and toxicity of SBRT for these patients have
not been well documented previously. This study demonstrated
that SBRT is an effective treatment modality with a low incidence
of severe side effects for advanced HCC with PVTT/IVCTT.
With advances in radiotherapy techniques, 3DCRT has proved
its efficacy in HCC with vascular invasion. The overall treatment
response rate from the series of 3DCRT was 25.2–62.3% [6–13].
The 1-year overall survival (OS) rate was 25.0–57.6%, with a
median survival time of 3.8–13.9 months [6–13]. However, most
of the prior published reports of 3DCRT have relatively small
number of patients. In one large series from Korea consisting of
412 HCC with PVTT, the patients were treated with 40 (range,
21–60) Gy in daily fractions of 2–5 Gy [8]. The response rate of
PVTT was 39.6%. The median survival was 10.6 months, and the
1-year OS rate was 42.5%. Huang et al. [12] reported the worst
response rate of 25.2% for PVTT treated with 3DCRT or IMRT.
For the 326 patients, the median survival time was only 3.8
months, with the one-year OS rate of 16.7%. The best survival
outcome was reported by Rim et al. [10], who reported that the
CR and PR rates for 45 HCC patients with PVTT were 6.7% and
55.6%, respectively. As for the limited studies reporting the
efficacy of SBRT for PVTT, the median OS was only 6–8 months
for fewer than 10 patients [14,15]. In the present study, the
objective response rate was 75.6%, with a median survival of 13.0
months, which was at the higher end of the wide range reported
previously. In addition, our results are similar to other reports
stating that response to radiotherapy was associated with better
survival [10–13]. The median OS of patients with objective
response (18.0 months) in our series was better than that in most
previous studies (10.7–19.9 months) [10–13]. The difference in the
response rates and survival between our study and others may be
caused by different radiation techniques, variation in dose
schedules, different response evaluation criteria, as well as
heterogeneous eligibility criteria for radiotherapy.
The majority of previous reports of 3DCRT for HCC used 1.8–
3.0 Gy daily to achieve total doses of 30–60 Gy [6]. However, at
present, the optimal dose fractionation schedule for SBRT is still
unclear. Tse et al. [20] reported good outcomes for unresectable
HCC and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma treated with SBRT in
six fractions administered during two weeks. Therefore, we
adopted this dose schedule for the treatment of PVTT/IVCTT
in our study. Our study showed that six-fraction SBRT was well
tolerated by HCC patients with PVTT/IVCTT, without the
occurrence of related serious toxicities. The incidence of Grade 3
acute toxicity in our cohort (2.4%) was lower than that reported in
previous 3DCRT series [7,8,13].

SBRT for HCC with PVTT/IVCTT
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 6 May 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 5 | e63864

Although SBRT is a promising therapeutic strategy for HCC
with tumor thrombosis, survival after radiotherapy remains limited
due to the high frequency of intra- and extra-hepatic recurrences.
In theory, the combination of radiotherapy and systemic therapy
may provide clinical benefits for patients with PVTT/IVCTT.
Sorafenib, an orally active multi-kinase inhibitor, is the only
systemic agent that has demonstrated an improved OS in HCC
patients [22,23]. In the current study, 14 patients (34.1%) received
combining therapy of sorafenib and SBRT. The group that
received this treatment showed a favorable trend in median
survival (16.6 vs. 10.9 months); however, it was not statistically
significant (P = 0.755). The limited number of patients who
received sorafenib in our study may affect the analysis of its
therapeutic efficacy; thus, a prospective study addressing this
combination is warranted.
Robotic non-isocentric dedicated linac systems are widely used
for SBRT in the thoracic and abdominal regions. However,
current clinical experience with VMAT-based SBRT is still scarce.
A unique feature of this study is the combination of SBRT with
VMAT, which is a new development in multileaf collimator-based
linac radiation delivery. VMAT is a novel extension of the
standard IMRT technique, allowing dose delivery with simulta￾neously varying gantry speed, MLC shape, and dose rate. The
major advantages of VMAT over classic IMRT are the lower
number of MUs and the higher delivery efficiency, with a
reduction of 35–61% in treatment time [24]. The average
treatment time was 3.960.6 min for VMAT in our study, which
is similar to that reported by Scorsetti et al. [25]. Taking into
account the plan quality, treatment efficiency, and delivery
accuracy, VMAT-based SBRT can be considered clinically
feasible for the treatment of HCC with PVTT/IVCTT.
In conclusion, our study suggests that VMAT-based SBRT is a
very safe and effective treatment option for PVTT/IVCTT in
HCC patients. Prospective randomized controlled trials are
required to further confirm the role of SBRT in these patients.
