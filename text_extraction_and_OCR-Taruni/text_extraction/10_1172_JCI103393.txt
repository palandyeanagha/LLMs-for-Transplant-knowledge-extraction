The successful transplantation of a human kid￾ney between 24-year-old male identical twins has
made possible the study of the function of a homo￾transplanted kidney. The purposes of the study
were twofold: 1) to evaluate the functional ca￾pacity of the transplanted kidney; 2) more specifi￾cally, to investigate the capacity of a transplanted,
and therefore totally denervated, kidney to regu￾late renal hemodynamics and electrolyte and water
excretion.
Studies were performed on both the recipient
(R) and the donor (D). All but one of the ex￾periments on R were performed after his own
two kidneys had been surgically removed; thus,
the majority of the data obtained specifically de￾scribes the function of the transplanted organ.
Certain parallel studies were performed on D, who
after transplantation possessed as his only source
of renal function the mate of the transplanted
kidney.
METHODS
Case material
The subjects were 24-year-old white male monozygous
twins. The donor was clinically well and possessed
normal renal function. The recipient was a victim of far
advanced, inexorably progressive chronic glomerulo￾nephritis of at least 16 months' duration and prior to
transplantation presented the classic manifestations of
uremia and malignant hypertension. After a period of
'This study was supported in part by grants from
the John A. Hartford Foundation, Inc.; the Medical Re￾search and Development Board, Office of the Surgeon
General, Department of the Army; the U. S. Public
Health Service; and the American Heart Association.

preliminary study, during which time the twins were
shown to be identical, D's left kidney was transplanted
retroperitoneally into the right iliac fossa of R. End
to end anastomoses were effected between the renal
artery of the transplanted organ and the recipient's right
hypogastric artery and between the renal vein and the
right common iliac vein. The ureter was implanted di￾rectly into the urinary bladder.
Clinical improvement began in the immediate post￾operative period and continued until all the apparent
stigmata of both uremia and hypertension regressed.
Bilateral nephrectomy was performed in a two-stage
procedure at three and at five and one-half months fol￾lowing transplantation, leaving R with only the trans￾planted organ. To date he has enjoyed over a year of
total well being on an unrestricted regimen. Detailed
accounts of the clinical course and operative procedure
have been previously described (1).
Procedure
Twenty-three clearance studies and several miscellane￾ous experiments were performed over an eighteen-month
period. Control studies were obtained on D prior to
transplantation. The majority of observations on R was
made during a four-month interval beginning six months
after transplantation.
Except where indicated, all studies were performed
in the morning with the subjects postprandial and re￾cumbent. In ten studies (six on R and four on D) glo￾merular filtration rate (GFR) was measured by the
clearance of inulin (C,3) using standard renal clearance
techniques as previously described (2). In nine of these
ten studies, effective renal plasma flow (ERPF) was
measured by the clearance of p-aminohippurate (ClAN).
In six of the studies in which C,3 was measured, urine
was collected through an inlying soft rubber multiholed
catheter, and urine collection periods (15 to 20 minutes
in duration) were concluded with two washouts of
distilled water and two or more injections of air. In
the control and early postoperative studies on D and the
postoperative (left nephrectomy) and osmotic diuresis
studies on R, bladder catheterization was not performed.
In an additional ten studies (six on R and four on D)
endogenous creatinine clearance (Cc,) was employed to
estimate trends in GFR. These studies were carried out
using voided specimens. In the majority of individual

clearance periods, urine flows exceeded five ml. per
minute, and the collection periods were generally greater
than 20 minutes in duration. Finally, in three studies (on
the recipient) GFR was estimated by means of 24-hour
Ccr. The experiments which did not include estimation
of- GFR will be considered in the text.
Because of the diversified nature of the experiments
performed, additional comments on individual experi￾mental protocols will be included in the discussion of
results.
Inulin was determined according to the method
of Roe, Epstein, and Goldstein (3); PAH according to
the method of Smith, Finkelstein, Aliminosa, Crawford,
and Graber (4); chloride according to the method of
Van Slyke and Hiller (5); and creatinine according to
the method of Bonsnes and Taussky (6). Sodium and
potassium were analyzed on an internally compensated
Barclay flame photometer; urine and plasma osmolalities
were determined on a Fiske Osmometer; pH was deter￾mined on a Beckman pH meter; and CO2 was determined
manometrically (7).
Clearance values have not been corrected to standard
body surface area. For purposes of such correction, the
body surface area of the recipient was 1.71 sq.m., and of
the donor 1.80 sq.m.

Donor: C13 increased from 68 ml. per minute
one week after transpiantation to 84 ml. per minute
eight months later. CPAH increased from 389 to
420 over the same period. COr varied in an in￾consistent manner between 76 and 93 ml. per
minute. C0r/Cjn (using composite mean values
for the same period of time) was 1.07.
B. Concentration and dilution (Table II)
Concentrating ability in R was assessed both by
the maximal osmotic U/P ratio and by the maxi￾mal rate of solute-free water removal." Following
withdrawal of water for 14 hours, R achieved a
maximal osmotic U/P ratio of 2.78. During os￾motic diuresis induced by mannitol infusion and
under the influence of Pitressin@ antidiuresis (100
mU administered intravenously as a single priming
dose, and 1 mU per minute by constant infusion)
the maximal value for solute-free water exttion
(TmcnHo) was 3.4 ml. per minute. The ratio
The concentration process in the normal subject is
characterized by two limiting values. At low rates of
urine flow, solute-free water may be reabsorbed to a maxi￾mal osmotic U/P ratio of approximately four. At high
rates of urine flow, such as are obtained during osmotic
diuresis, the renoval of solute-free water under maxIal
ADH stimulation is governed by an upper limit (Tmwxo).
The normal value for Tmxs2o is 5.1 ± 1.5 per cent C,.
(8). The osmotic U/P ratio in the normal subject dur￾ing water diuresis does not typically decrease below 0.2.
TmcHSo/C1l remained constant at 5.8 per cent
during the final three clearance periods.
The diluting capacity of R was judged by means
of his ability to elaborate a hypotonic urine fol￾lowing water loading.6 The minimal osmotic U/P
ratio observed was 0.36.
The concentrating and diluting abilities of D
were tested under conditions of water deprivation
and water loading, respectively. The osmotic
U/P ratios were of the same order of magnitude
as those of the recipient.
C. Acidification and alkalinization (Table III)
The recipient was given 4.0 gm. of non-enteric
coated ammonium chloride in divided doses over
the course of one day. On the following morn￾ing, voided urine samples were collected under
oil at approximately 30-minute intervals. After
a control period, 0.25 gm. of Diamox's (acetazole￾amide) was administered by mouth and five fol￾low-up periods were obtained.
Following DiamoxS administration, uriner pH
rose from a control value of 5.33 to 7.63. Titrata￾ble acid disappeared within 30 minutes and bicarbo￾nate and potassium excretion rates increased ap￾preciably. Excretion rates of Na and Cl will be
discussed below.

served (Figure 2). After three control periods
in each subject, l-norepinephrine was infused con￾tinuously at the rate of 2 pg. per minute. Approxi￾mately 15 minutes was allowed for equilibration,
and three clearance periods were then obtained.
Thereafter, l-norepinephrine was administered
at 10 LAg. per minute, and following stabilization of
blood pressures (approximately 25 minutes)
three final periods were obtained.
Blood pressure did not increase appreciably in
either subject during the 2 ,g. dose, whereas rises
of 30 to 40 mm. systolic and 20 to 25 mm. diastolic
were produced by the larger dose. C1. remained
constant throughout in both subjects. CpAH,
however, decreased strikingly during the infusion
of the low dose, and following the increment in
dosage a further decrease was demonstrable. Fil￾tration fractions rose from a control value of 15
to 30 per cent in R and from 20 to 30 per cent in
D. Data on solute and water excretion will be
discussed below.
C. Orthostatic hypotension
The results of this study in R are shown in
Figure 3. The experiment was intended to as￾sess the response to quiet standing; however,
changing from the recumbent to the erect position
on each of two occasions was attended by symp￾toms and signs of peripheral vascular collapse.
In both instances return to the supine position was
followed by prompt improvement. It was not pos￾sible to obtain measurements of blood pressure
during the periods of maximal distress, but it is
probable that the actual fall exceeded that re￾corded in Figure 3.
During the first clearance period following hy￾potension, CQ fell from the mean control value of
61 ml. per minute to 29, and thereafter increased
slowly, ultimately exceeding the control level.

After three control periods, 134 mg. of hydro￾cortisone hemisuccinate (equivalent to 100 mg. of
hydrocortisone) was administered by single intra￾venous injection, and 134 mg. was administered
by constant infusion in 500 ml. of 0.9 per cent sa￾line over a two-hour period. Observations were

CCr decreased moderately during the period of
drug administration, but thereafter returned to
the control level. Urine flow, sodium excretion
rate (UN.V), and chloride excretion rate (Uo1V)
all increased initially; however, by the ninth clear￾ance period, a decrease in each of these values was
noted. During the tenth clearance period (340
minutes after the start of the infusion) UNSV had
decreased to a minimum value of 27.5,Eq. per

B. Influence of alterations of extracellular fluid
(ECF) volume and composition
1. Venous congestion of the lower extremities:
The normal supine human subject responds to
the inflation of blood pressure cuffs around the
thighs at subdiastolic pressures by decreasing the
excretion rates of sodium and water and usu￾ally decreasing glomerular filtration rate (9, 10).:
However, UNaV and Uc1V usually do not decrease
(and often increase) during the first clearance
period of cuffing (9, 10).
Experiments were performed on both R and D
(Figure 4). The subjects were water loaded and
maintained in positive water balance throughout.
After three control clearance periods, blood pres￾sure cuffs were inflated to just below diastolic
pressures and were so maintained for approxi￾mately an hour.
Inflation of the blood pressure cuffs in R was
attended by a fall in blood pressure and a con￾comitant decrease in Cin. By the third period of
cuffing, blood pressure and filtration rate returned
to control levels. An appreciable decrease in
UNaV occurred only during the first period of
cuffing, and the mean value for the three periods
of cuffing was only 11 per cent below the mean
control value. During the follow-up periods
UNIV approximated control values. Chloride
excretion rates paralleled those of sodium. A de￾crease in urine flow occurred, which was out of
proportion to that of UNIV both in magnitude and
duration. Values rose slightly after the cuffs were
released. The urine flow response resembled that
observed in the normal subject.
In D, Cfi remained constant throughout. UNIV
increased from the mean control value during the
first period of cuffing, but fell during the succeed￾ing two periods. During the follow-up periods,
UNIV rose, eventually exceeding the control value.
The decrease in Uo1V was greater in magnitude

creased and remained depressed throughout the
duration of the study.
3. Hypotonic expansion of ECF: The rapid
infusion of two liters of hypotonic sodium chloride
into a hydrated human subject in the supine posi￾tion evokes an increase in UNSV despite a de￾crease in plasma sodium concentration (11).
The influence of hypotonic expansion of ECF
was studied twice in R and once in D (Table V,
A-C). The subjects were hydrated initially (500
ml. of water over a 30 to 60-minute period) and
maintained in positive water balance thereafter.
The control periods were begun after brisk water
diuresis was in force.
In R (Table V-A) hypotonic expansion was
associated with a progressive decrease in total sol￾ute, sodium and chloride excretion rates. Urine
flow showed only minor changes and Ccr decreased
moderately. Plasma sodium concentration (PNa)
fell strikingly following hydration and increased
modestly after completion of the infusion.
In a separate study (Table V-B), R's response
to a less hypotonic solution was observed. The
results were similar to those noted in the preceding
experiment, despite the fact that the decrease in
PNa was of small magnitude.
The donor responded to hypotonic expansion in
a manner characteristic of the normal subject
(Table V-C). Thus, urine flow, total solute ex￾cretion, UNaV, and U01V all increased appreciably
subsequent to initiation of the infusion. Ca, ap￾proximated control levels during expansion but
rose during the follow-up periods.
4. Isotonic expansion of ECF: The normal hu￾man responds to the intravenous administration of
isotonic saline by a moderate increase in the excre￾tion rates of sodium and water and by the elabora￾tion of an isotonic or hypertonic urine. When a
single dose of two liters of water is administered
8 to 12 hours in advance of the saline infusion, the
latter produces a copious excretion both of sodium
and of water and the urine becomes hypotonic
(12, 13).
The response of both R and D to the infusion
of 3,000 ml. of isotonic saline at 42 to 54 ml. per
minute was observed. Each subject was studied
twice, once in the hydropenic state (no water for
14 hours preceding the infusion), and again in
the prehydrated state having ingested two liters
of tap water ten hours before the infusion.

Table VI. C07 showed a slight initial increase fol￾lowed by a delayed fall. Urine flow increased
progressively, but this was due largely to an in￾crease in free water clearance (CHEo). As a con￾sequence, the urine became markedly hypotonic
(osmotic U/P ratio = 0.36). Osmolar clearance
(Cost) and sodium excretion rates exhibited only
minimal and unsustained increases.
Recipient, prehydrated state: The initial values
for CCr, urine flow, and electrolyte excretion rates
were all higher than those noted in the hydropenic
study. CCr remained constant throughout. Urine
flow exhibited a progressive increase, and in this
experiment, C... contributed appreciably to this.
CH2O also increased and osmotic U/P ratios
reached a minimum value of 0.37. UNaV in￾creased gradually but progressively throughout,
reaching a peak value of 356 ,uEq. per minute as
compared to the maximal value of 135 pEq. per
minute noted during the hydropenic study.
Donor, hydropenic state: The results of this
and the succeeding study on D are shown in
Table VII. C,,, urine flow, CIMM and CH20 all
increased during the first five periods. Osmotic
U/P ratios decreased to a minimum of 0.76.
UN.V rose from 118 pEq. per minute to a maximal
value of 436 during the third clearance period, and
thereafter decreased.
Donor, prehydrated state: Prehydration did not
appear to enhance electrolyte excretion. Thus, the
increases in C.m and UN.V were smaller than
those noted in the hydropenic study. The increase
in CEHO was of greater magnitude, however, and
osmotic U/P ratios decreased to 0.43.
5. Infusion of hyperoncotic salt poor albumin:
The intravenous administration of 25 per cent
salt poor human albumin into normal supine sub￾jects has been shown to evoke a decrease in the
rates of solute and water excretion (14). When
the albumin is infused rapidly (e.g., 100 ml. in
15 to 20 minutes) the antidiuresis is more marked
(15).
The responses of both R and D to the rapid in￾fusion of 300 ml. of salt poor human albumin are
shown in Tables VIII and IX. Water diuresis
was induced by the preliminary ingestion of 1,500
ml. of water and maintained by the ingestion of
water in quantities slightly exceeding the urinary
volumes.
In R, no trend in Cc1 was apparent subsequent
to the initiation of the infusion. During the infu￾sion, urine flow and CH2O decreased slightly;
however, osmotic U/P ratios showed no consistent
increase. C.m remained constant during and fol￾lowing the albumin infusion, and although UNaV
decreased progressively during the control periods,

DISCUSSION
The recipient twin represents an extraordinary
experimental preparation in that his sole source of
renal function is a transplanted kidney. Of addi￾tional interest is the fact that during the trans￾plantation procedure the kidney became totally
and irrefutably denervated. That the transplanted
organ has maintained a considerable degree of
functional integrity, and indeed that it functions in
many respects in a normal manner is attested to by
the following observations: 1) Its filtration rate
approximates that of the donor's remaining kidney.
2) It has maintained its ability to concentrate
urine. 3) It is able to dilute urine. 4) It is able
to acidify urine. 5) It is able to alkalinize urine.
6) It is able both to increase and to decrease its
rate of sodium excretion in response to varying
stimuli. 7) It has the capacity to alter acutely
both its filtration rate and renal plasma flow. 8)
It has been able to maintain extracellular fluid
volume and composition intact over a prolonged
period of time despite widely varying dietary and
climatic conditions.
Stability of glomerular filtration rate and renal
plasma flow
In the recipient, serial studies (beginning six
months after transplantation) showed neither a
progressive rise nor a fall in either GFR or ERPF.
It is probable, however, that some increase in
clearance values occurred earlier in his course.
This possibility receives indirect support from
two sources: 1) Autotransplantation of a normal
dog kidney to the iliac fossa using surgical tech￾niques identical to those employed in the present
subject is frequently attended by a marked initial
decrease in clearance values with slow return to￾ward control levels (16). 2) Clinical tests (in￾cluding endogenous creatinine clearances) during
the initial two-month period suggested improve￾ment in renal function (1).
Serial observations on the donor over an eight￾month period following unilateral nephrectomy
revealed a moderate rise in GFR and ERPF.
The sum of the values for C. in recipient and
donor eight months following transplantation was
essentially equal to the two-kidney control value in
the donor (145 vs. 147 ml. per minute). The com￾bined value for CpAH at eight months was appreci￾ably greater than the control value (782 vs. 477).
The degree to which the rise in CpAH represents
compensatory hypertrophy is obscured by the fact
that the control value may have been inordinately
low (filtration fraction 33 per cent) due to the
donor's state of marked apprehension.
Renal hemodynamic regulation
The recipient's responses to experimental events
which typically induce changes in GFR and/or
ERPF could not be distinguished from normal.
Thus, following Aminophylline administration, Ci.
increased acutely with no increase in CpAH; during
l-norepinephrine infusion CPAH decreased mark￾edly while C,, remained constant; and following
orthostatic hypotension C15 and Cp both de￾creased sharply and remained depressed after
blood pressure returned to normal. These data
suggest 1) that both renal vasodilatation and re￾nal vasoconstriction may occur in the absence of
renal nerves, 2) that Aminophylline and l-norepi￾nephrine may both act directly on the renal vessels,
and 3) that renal vasoconstriction occurring in a
denervated kidney may outlast systemic vasocon￾striction. The results of these studies lend some
support to the conviction that the regulation of
renal hemodynamics in homeostasis is not de￾pendent upon renal nerves.

FUNCTIONAL CAPACITY OF A TRANSPLANTED HUMAN KIDNEY1
Electrolyte excretion
Two general categories of experiments were
employed to study electrolyte excretion by the
transplanted kidney: 1) administration of drugs
which are generally conceded to influence sodium
excretion at the intrarenal level; and 2) alteration
of extrarenal factors which are capable of modify￾ing sodium excretion in the normal subject.
The results of the studies included in the first
category were generally indistinguishable from
the normal response. Thus, following DiamoxS
administration, a sodium, chloride, potassium, and
bicarbonate diuresis occurred accompanied by a
decrease in titratable acidity. Following manni￾tol infusion, a progressive increase in sodium,
chloride, and potassium excretion rates was ob￾served. Following Aminophylline, a brisk sodium
and chloride diuresis occurred which persisted
after the filtration rate returned to control levels.
Finally, following intravenous hydrocortisone, a
fall in UNaV and Uc1V occurred associated with a
concurrent rise in U'KV. The infusion of i-nor￾epinephrine was not attended by a decrease in
sodium and chloride excretion rates. However,
the consistency with which this phenomenon oc￾curs in the normal has not yet been established
(17, 18).
The recipient's responses to experiments in the
second category were generally qualitatively or
quantitatively abnormal. In four studies, ECF
volume was expanded acutely. Following infu￾sion of hypotonic saline on two occasions, a de￾crease in sodium excretion rate occurred rather
than the increase observed in the normal subject.
Following the infusion of isotonic saline in the
hydropenic state, only a minimal and unsustained
increase in sodium excretion rate occurred. Fi￾nally, following infusion of hyperoncotic albumin,
only a negligible decrease in sodium excretion oc￾curred and this could not definitely be related to
the albumin infusion. During inflation of blood
pressure cuffs around extremities, a stimulus
which presumably results in a decrease in effec￾tive circulating blood volume, the only fall in so￾dium and chloride excretion rates occurred early
in cuffing (when the normal frequently notes an
increase). Moreover, the decrease was associated
with a fall in blood pressure and Ct,,, and despite
continuation of cuffing, UN,V and Uc1V returned
toward control levels. Following orthostatic hy￾potension, with its concomitant decrease in effec￾tive circulating blood volume, sodium and chloride
excretion rates decreased only during the period
of decreased filtration rate, and thereafter re￾turned toward control levels with the rise in Ct.
In the normal subject, temporary hypotension is
followed by a decrease in urinary excretion of so￾dium and chloride which appreciably outlasts the
decrease in GFR (19).
Water excretion
Three different stimuli employed in the re￾cipient to study water excretion independent of
the electrolyte excretion evoked changes: 1) in￾fusion of Pitressin@ produced a prompt antidiu￾resis; 2) alteration of plasma osmolality by water
loading and hydropenia produced water diuresis
and antidiuresis, respectively; and 3) expansion
of ECF volume without change in tonicity (iso￾tonic expansion in the hydropenic state) produced
a water diuresis, and decrease in effective circu￾lating blood volume (cuffing and orthostatic hy￾potension) evoked antidiureses out of proportion
to the decreases in electrolyte excretion.
Consideration of abnormal responses in recipient
The only consistent deviations from normal were
seen in the electrolyte excretion rates in those ex￾periments in which ECF volume was acutely al￾tered. Several variables should be considered
when evaluating these abnormalities. First, the
kidney was subjected to total anoxia for 90 min￾utes during the transplantation procedure. It is
therefore conceivable that the defects in electrolyte
excretion were due to a tubular lesion secondary
to anoxemia. Somewhat against this explanation
are 1) the prompt and normal response to drugs
influencing sodium excretion at the intrarenal
level, and 2) the many parameters of normal renal
function observed including the near-normal con￾centrating ability.
The second consideration is that the failure to
respond to volume changes was due to defective
hormonal mechanisms. A deficient release of
sodium-retaining hormones could also provide an
explanation for the incomplete cutback in sodium
excretion following ingestion of a 200 mg. sodium

diet. In this light it should be noted that the left
adrenal gland was removed at the time of left
nephrectomy. Evidence against the role of a hor￾monal abnormality is found in recent studies which
suggest that Addisonian subjects respond in a
normal manner to hypotonic saline (20), hyper￾oncotic albumin (15), and cuffing of the lower ex￾tremities (20). In addition, 24-hour excretion
rates of 17-ketosteroids and 17-hydroxysteroids
in the recipient were normal both in the control
state and following an eight-hour ACTH infu￾sion. Moreover, that the defect did not represent
an inability of the kidney to respond to salt-retain￾ing steroids is indicated by the normal response to
intravenous hydrocortisone. The demonstration
that prehydration facilitated the excretion of an
administered load of isotonic saline (although to
a lesser degree than that described in the two￾kidney normal subject) may indicate the presence
of a humoral influence on sodium excretion.
A third explanation for the defects observed in
electrolyte excretion is that they were due to an
abnormality in sodium transport which was pres￾ent prior to transplantation of the kidney. The
studies on the donor serve to minimize this pos￾sibility. Thus, his remaining kidney responded
normally to hypotonic expansion of ECF, isotonic
expansion of ECF in the hydropenic state, and
hyperoncotic albumin infusion. The response to
subdiastolic cuffing, although of small magnitude,
was qualitatively and temporally normal. Finally,
although the donor's response to isotonic saline
infusion in the prehydrated state was abnormal,
the recipient did not manifest the same abnor￾mality.
The final and perhaps most intriguing possibility
is that the recipient did not respond normally to
acute changes in volume because denervation in￾terrupted the efferent limb of a volume control
system. Numerous observations in recent years
have led to the belief that an extrarenal system
exists which, in the interests of preserving con￾stancy of ECF volume, is capable of influencing
the renal excretion of both water and sodium.
Changes in volume presumably affect water excre￾tion by influencing the rate of release of anti￾diuretic hormone. However, the mechanism by
which the kidney is notified to change its rate of
electrolyte excretion in response to volume changes
remains unknown. Both humoral and neurogenic
pathways have been discussed (21).
That the recipient could adequately control vol￾ume on a chronic basis is attested to by his main￾tenance of normal body weight and plasma elec￾trolyte concentrations over a period of many
months. Moreover, that changes in volume with￾out simultaneous changes in tonicity were capable
of evoking changes in water excretion has been
discussed above. There is some suggestion, how￾ever, that acute changes in volume did not evoke
the changes in electrolyte excretion rates which
are seen in normal subjects.
Although the present observations do not per￾mit definitive evaluation of the possibility that re￾nal nerves play a part in the efferent limb of the
volume control system in man, the data presented
are consistent with this interpretation.
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
Studies have been performed on a subject with
a homotransplanted and therefore denervated kid￾ney. The majority of experiments were performed
after the subject's own two kidneys had been surgi-
-cally removed, and the data therefore describe the
function of the transplanted organ. Certain paral￾lel observations were made on the donor who pos￾sessed as his only kidney the mate of the trans￾planted organ. The filtration rate in the donor
prior to transplantation was 147 ml. per minute.
Following transplantation GFR varied in the re￾cipient between 60 to 70 ml. per minute, whereas in
the donor it rose slightly from 68 to 84. Mani￾festations of the functional integrity of the trans￾planted kidney were multiple and included the
abilities to concentrate, dilute, acidify and alkali￾nize the urine, the capacity to respond normally
to experimental conditions which typically evoke
acute alterations in GFR and/or ERPF, the ca￾pacity to respond normally to a sodium retaining
adrenal steroid and to different diuretic agents, and
the ability to maintain ECF volume and composi￾tion intact over a prolonged period of time.
Abnormalities in sodium excretion of a qualita￾tive and/or quantitative nature were observed fol￾lowing acute alterations of extracellular volume.
Experiments in this category included: 1) hypo￾tonic expansion of ECF, 2) isotonic expansion of
ECF in the hydropenic state, 3) hyperoncotic al￾1378

bumin infusion, 4) venous congestion of the lower
extremities, and 5) orthostatic hypotension. Four
of these experiments were repeated on the donor
and the response in each instance was normal.
Changes in water excretion in the recipient oc￾curred following intravenous Pitressin@, changes
in plasma osmolality, and changes in extracellular
fluid volume. As examples of the latter, a marked
rise in free water clearance occurred following
isotonic expansion of ECF, and antidiuresis oc￾curred in association with venous congestion of
the lower extremities.
It is concluded: 1) That a transplanted kidney
in an identical twin host may function normally
in most respects and may not only sustain life but
may maintain normality. 2) That both renal
vasoconstriction and renal vasodilatation may oc￾cur in the absence of renal nerves, and that renal
nerves are probably not necessary for the regula￾tion of renal hemodynamics. 3) That renal nerves
are not necessary for the acute changes in electro￾lyte excretion occurring after administration of
either diuretic agents (carbonic anhydrase inhibi￾tor, xanthine derivative, or osmotically active non￾electrolytic solute) or a sodium-retaining adrenal
steroid. 4) That renal nerves are not necessary
for changes in water excretion following intrave￾nous Pitressin'@, changes in osmotic pressure, or
changes in extracellular fluid volume. 5) That
renal nerves are not necessary for the chronic
regulation of extracellular fluid volume or com￾position.
The possibility exists that the abnormalities in
sodium excretion noted in the recipient following
acute alteration of ECF volume occurred because
denervation interrupted the efferent limb of a vol￾ume control system.
