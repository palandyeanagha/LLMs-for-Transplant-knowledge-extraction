Abstract
Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) is an efficient therapeutic option to improve progress of lots of 
diseases especially hypoxia-related injuries, and has been clinically established as a wide-used 
therapy for patients with carbon monoxide poisoning, decompression sickness, arterial gas 
embolism, problematic wound, and so on. In the liver, most studies positively evaluated HBOT as a 
potential therapeutic option for liver transplantation, acute liver injury, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, 
fibrosis and cancer, especially for hepatic artery thrombosis. This might mainly attribute to the 
anti-oxidation and anti-inflammation of HBOT. However, some controversies are existed, possibly 
due to hyperbaric oxygen toxicity. This review summarizes the current understandings of the role 
of HBOT in liver diseases and hepatic regeneration. Future understanding of HBOT in clinical trials 
and its in-depth mechanisms may contribute to the development of this novel adjuvant strategy for 
clinical therapy of liver diseases.
Key words: hyperbaric oxygen; liver diseases; toxicity
Introduction
Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) was defined 
as “an intervention in which an individual breathes 
near 100% oxygen intermittently while inside a 
hyperbaric chamber that is pressurized to greater than 
sea level pressure (one atmosphere absolute [ATA])” 
by the Undersea and Hyperbaric Medicine Society [1]. 
In recent decades, numerous studies supported HBOT 
as an efficient therapeutic option to improve progress 
of lots of diseases especially hypoxia-related injuries. 
Furthermore, HBOT has been clinically established as 
a wide-used therapy for patients with carbon 
monoxide poisoning, decompression sickness, arterial 
gas embolism, problematic wound, and so on; and 
HBOT was also an important adjunctive therapy to 
treat diseases accompanied by impaired oxygen 
delivery [2]. In the liver, HBOT has been studied in 
hepatic artery thrombosis (HAT), acute liver injury, 
nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), bacterial 
infection, fibrosis and liver-related cancer. In this 
review, we will summarize the role of HBOT in liver 
diseases and hepatic regeneration, discuss hyperbaric 
oxygen toxicity, and evaluate the potential of clinical 
application of HBOT in liver.
HBOT in acute liver injury
Liver transplantation is the definitive treatment 
in end-stage liver diseases, which includes selected 
liver malignancies and liver failure [3]. However, at 
present, liver ischemia, preservation and reperfusion 
injury (IPRI) is still the major problem and hotspot for 
researchers. Over past decades, numerous studies 
seemed to support the application of HBOT in IPRI [4, 
5]. In 1967, Macdougal, J.D. et al. [6] reported that in 
vitro cultures of adult rat liver required a higher

oxygen tension for maintenance, which indicated that 
hyperbaric oxygen might improve injury of organ 
preservation. Furthermore, Slapak, M. et al. [7] and 
Spilg, H. et al. [8] successfully preserved animal livers 
for 24 hours under three atmospheres of oxygen and 
hypothermia. Another in vitro study showed that 
HBOT during liver cold storage protected against 
subsequent hepatic reperfusion injury by attenuating 
oxidant stress and the depletion of energy loss, such 
as ATP [9]. In vivo animal models were subjected to 
determine the effect of HBOT in IPRI since then. 
Prolonged preservation was found to enhance IPRI 
post-orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) in rats, 
characterized by more necrosis and apoptosis [10]. 
And similar to the in vitro study [9], HBOT reduced 
the severity of IPRI by protecting hepatocytes from 
necrosis and apoptosis and improving sinusoidal 
diameter and microvascular density index in the rat 
model of OLT [10].
The majority of in vivo animal studies evaluating 
HBOT used a model of hepatic warm ischemia￾reperfusion (I/R) injury. HBOT after surgery was 
shown to improve rat hepatic I/R injury via 
suppressing the accumulation of neutrophils. 
However, it is of importance to emphasize that only 
early HBOT given before neutrophil-mediated injury 
phase (in 3 hours after reperfusion) might take 
protective effect [11]. In addition, early HBOT after 
hepatic I/R injury also improved mitochondrial 
functions [12]. Besides, the therapeutic effect of HBOT 
in different periods of I/R was determined. And 
studies showed that HBOT subjected to early during 
ischemia played a more favorable effect compared to 
be subjected to both periods of ischemia and 
reperfusion; otherwise, HBOT given in the period of 
reperfusion was associated with a more severe 
hepatocyte apoptosis and liver damage [13, 14]. Yet 
the protection of HBOT in hepatic I/R injury still 
remains controversial. Margarido, M. R. et al. [15]
reported that HBOT during the ischemic period did 
not prevent the installation of mitochondrial edema 
induced by hepatic I/R. Moreover, HBOT precondi￾tioning gains more controversies. Hyperbaric oxygen 
administration one day before I/R protected rat liver 
against subsequent I/R injury, and administration 
three days before I/R took no effects [16]. Several 
studies also supported that injury induced by I/R 
immediately after a short-time HBOT (less than 60 
minutes) was more alleviated than I/R without 
HBOT, and this protection might mediate by HO-1 
and be characterized by attenuated hepatocyte 
apoptosis and improvement of mitochondrial 
functions [17-20]. However, a 120-minute HBOT 
immediately before I/R surgery did not protect 
against injury, with higher liver malondialdehyde 
(MDA) and nitric oxide (NO) levels compared to the 
60-minute HBOT [18]. Besides, two studies showed 
that HBOT preconditioning for 60 and 90 minutes 
even aggravated liver I/R injury via enhanced 
neutrophil accumulation [15, 21]. No effects on 
mitochondrial functions by a 60-minutes HBOT 
preconditioning were also reported [22]. 
Although discrepancies of effects of HBOT exist, 
the protective role of early HBOT after I/R is 
confirmed by animal studies. Thus, early HBOT (in 3 
hours) in patients receiving liver transplantation 
might improve their prognosis, and further related 
clinical trials are necessary.
HBOT has also been reported as an adjuvant 
treatment to successfully rescue a 3-year-old girl with 
acute liver failure (ALF) and coma [23], which 
suggests the protective role of HBOT in acute liver 
injury. Coincidentally, HBOT helped to rescue a 
28-year-old man ingested a large dose of carbon 
tetrachloride [24]. HBOT was also shown to protect 
the liver from hepatotoxicity of halothane anesthesia 
or its metabolites in patients in some cases [25].
In animal studies, hyperoxia protects 
hepatocytes against carbon tetrachloride toxicity 
[26-29]. Immediate HBOT attenuated the rise in lipid 
peroxidation and necrosis, and prevented the 
mortality 24 hours after intoxication; otherwise, 
delayed HBOT (one hour after intoxication) prevent￾ed the mortality but was less effective in alleviating 
necrosis [26]. HBOT could decrease free radical 
formation in carbon tetrachloride-treated liver [28]. 
However, loss of this protection was very rapid, 
because HBOT 6 hours after carbon tetrachloride 
administration augmented hepatic necrosis instead 
[29]. Thus, it is better to use HBOT for ALF as early as 
possible.
In zymosan-shocked rats, HBOT attenuated the 
increase of myeloperoxidase (MPO) and MDA in 
liver, finally prevented the development of liver 
failure [30]. HBOT also attenuated the zymosan￾induced expression of TLR2 and TLR4, NF-κB 
activation, and cytokine production in liver, indica￾ting hyperbaric oxygen as an inflammatory regulator 
[31]. In another ALF model of acetaminophen 
(APAP)-induced liver injury, HBOT reduced early 
APAP hepatotoxicity via regulating HIF-1α [32]. And 
HBOT augmented the protective effect of N-acetyl￾cysteine (NAC) on APAP-induced liver injury [33]. 
Although nearly all studies reported the protective 
role of HBOT in acute liver injury, it is noteworthy 
that prolonged HBOT (3 or 4 hours) aggravated 
hepatic necrosis induced by APAP, bromobenzene, 
dimethylnitrosamine (DEN) or thioacetamide (TAA), 
and had no effect on liver injury induced by galactos￾amine (GalN) or lipopolysaccharide (LPS). This

prolonged treatment caused a 50% mortality in rats 
and hamsters intoxicated with APAP, and this high 
mortality was not due to APAP-induced hepatotox￾icity but rather due to intolerance to long-time 
hyperbaric oxygen exposure [29]. The effects of HBOT 
on acute liver injury and ALF need to be further 
investigated.
HBOT in liver regeneration
All of studies now published confirmed that 
HBOT promoted liver regeneration after hepatictomy, 
including pre-surgery and post-surgery HBOT [34, 
35]. In vitro study reported hyperbaric oxygen 
stimulated hepatocyte proliferation via normalizing 
Mrp-2 localization to apical membrane and subsequ￾ently activating the transporter function [36]. HBOT is 
closely associated with mitochondrial function 
improvement in liver regeneration. And HBOT 
stabilized energy metabolism by inducing oxygen 
delivery after partial hepatectomy (PHx) [37]. HBOT 
also decreased MDA and increased antioxidant 
activities, including glutathione (GSH) and super￾oxide dismutase (SOD) activities to benefit liver 
regeneration [38]. Furthermore, biochemical analysis 
of mitochondrial respiration, respiratory control rate 
(RCR) and mitochondrial permeability transition 
(MPT) supported that HBOT protected mitochondria 
during liver regeneration [39]. Besides, both of pre￾surgery and post-surgery HBOT could promote 
angiogenesis via enhanced VEGF in regenerating liver 
[35, 40]. Ganglioside GM3 was also involved in 
mediation of beneficial effects of pre-operatively 
oxygenation after PHx [41]. Similarly, HBOT 
augmented hepatocyte proliferation in hepatic injury￾induced regeneration [10]. More importantly, HBOT 
facilitated liver regeneration in living donors after 
liver transplantation [42]. All of previous studies 
supported the HBOT in liver regeneration, especially 
for liver donors after hepatectomy.
HBOT in liver fibrosis
Few studies of the effects of HBOT on hepatic 
fibrosis were performed. Using a hepatic injury and 
fibrosis model of bile duct ligation (BDL), 
investigators found that HBOT alleviated oxidative 
injury, hepatocyte damage, bile duct proliferation and 
fibrosis [43, 44]. The effects of HBOT on fibrotic 
reduction seems to be due to the its antioxidant role 
against injury [43]. However, we still have a long way 
to understand the definite effect of HBOT on liver 
fibrosis and cirrhosis.
HBOT in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis
Using monosodium glutamate (MSG) mice, 
which are an animal model of NASH, obesity, 
diabetes and hyperlipidemia, Tsuneyama, K. et al. 
[45] found HBOT significantly lowered the body 
weight, but increased oxidative stress and augmented 
cellular damage and TNFα expression. Thus, HBOT 
might not a fine option for NASH, and more 
investigations are necessary.
HBOT in liver-related cancer
As tumor hypoxia is important for cancer 
progression, HBOT could be used as a candidate 
therapy. Yet hyperbaric oxygen promotes cell 
proliferation, and no one could confirm that HBOT 
does not promote cancer cell proliferation in patients. 
This issue limits the development of HBOT as an 
anti-tumor therapy clinically [46]. For hepatocellular 
carcinoma (HCC), HBOT might overcome deficiencies 
in systemic and hepatic oxygen supply and 
subsequently diminish post-operative complications. 
In addition, HBOT improved postoperative immune 
response and long-term survival after liver section in 
HCC patients [47]. Although the benefit of HBOT was 
determined, the potential risk of HBOT in cancer 
patients was not evaluated and it could not be 
ignored. An early animal study demonstrated that 
HBOT did not have a tumor stimulatory effect on 
colorectal liver metastases but significantly reduced 
necrosis and proliferation in tumor compared to the 
non-HBOT group [48], which suggested that HBOT 
might potentially be safe and efficient for cancer.
In solid tumors, hypoxia always associated with 
radiotherapy and chemotherapy resistance. HBOT 
could increase tissue oxygen pressure and content, 
and might prevent this resistance. Thus, hyperbaric 
oxygen combined with radiotherapy or chemotherapy 
has been intensively investigated [46]. An in vitro
study showed that HBOT, sorafenib or cisplatin alone 
all could inhibit HCC cell growth, yet HBOT 
combined with sorafenib or cisplatin led to much 
greater synergistic proliferative inhibition and 
apoptotic induction [49], suggesting a potential 
adjuvant application of HBOT in HCC patients.
HBOT in sepsis-induced liver injury
A quite early study in 1976 reported that daily 
HBOT begun either 1 day or 1 week after anerobic 
infection of Fusobacterium necrophorum and Bacteroides 
fragilis significantly reduced the number and size of 
liver abscesses in mice [50]. In septic rats, hyperbaric 
oxygen pretreatment combining HO-1 activation 
alleviated LPS-induced liver injury, but HBOT alone 
did not affect liver injury, indicating that HO-1-
mediated the protective role of HBOT [51]. In 
Escherichia coli-induced sepsis, HBOT sufficiently 
augmented the protection of cefepime, and the 
combined therapy reversed most septic rats to present

a normal liver histology, though HBOT alone helped 
nothing for these septic rats [52]. Another protective 
mechanism of HBOT might be its effective prevention 
of bacterial translocation [53]. Overall, HBOT is a 
potential adjuvant option for treatment of sepsis, yet 
more clinical investigations are necessary.
HBOT in artery thrombosis
Hepatic artery thrombosis can occur in up to 
10% of adult or children OLT [54-56]. HBOT 
significantly delayed retransplantation of child patie￾nts with HAT [57]. Another case showed that six-time 
HBOT successfully recanalized hepatic artery in 
children with HAT, while alteplase failed open the 
artery before HBOT [55]. And they found the patients 
tolerated HBOT and suffered no complications from 
the HBOT [55, 57]. Similarly, HBOT could also treat 
adult patients with HAT as reported [54, 56]. Thus, 
HBOT would be a promising therapy for patients with 
HAT because of its efficiency and patient tolerance. 
Even though some case reports suggested the benefit 
of the HBOT in HAT, more randomized controlled 
trials are needed to explore the application of the 
HBOT for HAT.
Hyperbaric oxygen toxicity
With limited clinical experience of hyperbaric 
oxygen application in 1960s, there happened at least 
one death attribute to the use of hyperbaric oxygen 
[58]. The hyperbaric oxygen toxicity in liver was 
studied since then. Oxygen toxicity was primarily due 
to initiate the free-radical chain reaction by oxygen, 
which then aggravated spontaneously with the 
consequent lipid peroxidation. The early phase of 
HBOT involved the lipid peroxide metabolism, which 
could be reduced via glutathione peroxidase reaction. 
And the latter phase linked to glutathione oxidation 
and release of GSSG. The GSSG was then reduced via 
the glutathione reductase reaction, linking to NADPH 
oxidation, which subsequently generating more 
reactive oxygen species (ROS), and finally leading to 
cell death [59, 60]. All of these alterations by HBOT 
may cause the pathological disruption of physiolo￾gical functions including interrupted biosynthesis. 
For instance, exposure of organ cultures of rat livers to 
hyperbaric oxygen resulted in rapid loss of succinic 
dehydrogenase and cytochrome oxidase activity [61]. 
Nutritional antioxidant supplementation may offset 
HBOT-induced oxidative stress. It has been reported 
that vitamin C, vitamin E and succinate could protect 
liver against hyperbaric oxygen toxicity [62-64]. 
Noteworthily, most hyperbaric oxygen toxicity obser￾ved was under the condition of more than 3 ATA; but 
in clinical application, the hyperbaric oxygen therapy 
is always controlled under 2 ATA. Thus, at present, 
the case of clinical HBOT-induced injury or death in 
patients is quite rare. However, the safe dose and 
frequency of HBOT in liver diseases need to be paid 
great attention while clinical application.
Conclusion
Most studies positively 
evaluated HBOT as a potential 
adjunct for LT, acute liver 
injury, NASH, fibrosis and 
cancer, especially for HAT (Fig. 
1). This might mainly attribute 
to the anti-oxidation and 
anti-inflammation of HBOT, 
and HO-1 seems to be closely 
involved in HBOT-mediated 
protection. Furthermore, it 
would have better results for 
patients to apply HBOT as early 
as possible in most situations. 
However, the hyperbaric oxyg￾en toxicity cannot be ignored. 
The strategy of HBOT should 
be prudently drawn up to 
assure safety and effectivity, 
and sometimes the nutritional 
antioxidant supplementation 
could be combined with HBOT 
to avoid oxygen toxicity. Even 
though HBOT could only treat 
Figure 1. HBOT in liver diseases. In liver, immediate HBOT reduces inflammation and oxidant stress to protect 
hepatocytes in liver injury. HBOT also facilitates hepatocyte proliferation and improves fibrogenesis. HBOT 
inhibits bacterial translocation to attenuate sepsis-induced liver injury. In addition, HBOT is definitely an effective 
therapy for artery thrombosis. Even though the role of HBO in liver cancer cell proliferation is undetermined, 
combination of HBOT and radiotherapy or chemotherapy sensitive cancer cells to death. However, improper 
HBOT leads to increase of oxidant stress and hepatotoxicity.

HAT clinically at present, we believe that it would be 
the most promising adjuvant therapy for other liver 
diseases after in-depth studies.
