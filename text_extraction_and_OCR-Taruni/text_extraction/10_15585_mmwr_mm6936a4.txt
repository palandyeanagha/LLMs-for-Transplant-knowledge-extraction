Temporary disruptions in routine and nonemergency medical 
care access and delivery have been observed during periods of 
considerable community transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus 
that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) (1). However, 
medical care delay or avoidance might increase morbidity and 
mortality risk associated with treatable and preventable health 
conditions and might contribute to reported excess deaths directly 
or indirectly related to COVID-19 (2). To assess delay or avoid￾ance of urgent or emergency and routine medical care because of 
concerns about COVID-19, a web-based survey was administered 
by Qualtrics, LLC, during June 24–30, 2020, to a nationwide 
representative sample of U.S. adults aged ≥18 years. Overall, an 
estimated 40.9% of U.S. adults have avoided medical care during 
the pandemic because of concerns about COVID-19, including 
12.0% who avoided urgent or emergency care and 31.5% who 
avoided routine care. The estimated prevalence of urgent or emer￾gency care avoidance was significantly higher among the following 
groups: unpaid caregivers for adults* versus noncaregivers (adjusted 
prevalence ratio [aPR] = 2.9); persons with two or more selected 
underlying medical conditions† versus those without those condi￾tions (aPR = 1.9); persons with health insurance versus those without 
health insurance (aPR = 1.8); non-Hispanic Black (Black) adults 
(aPR = 1.6) and Hispanic or Latino (Hispanic) adults (aPR = 1.5) 
versus non-Hispanic White (White) adults; young adults aged 
*Unpaid caregiver status was self-reported. The definition of an unpaid caregiver for 
adults was having provided unpaid care to a relative or friend aged ≥18 years to help 
them take care of themselves at any time in the last 3 months. Examples provided to 
survey respondents included helping with personal needs, household chores, health 
care tasks, managing a person’s finances, taking them to a doctor’s appointment, 
arranging for outside services, and visiting regularly to see how they are doing.
† Selected underlying medical conditions known to increase the risk for severe 
COVID-19 included in this analysis were obesity (body mass index [BMI] ≥30 kg/m2), 
diabetes, high blood pressure, cardiovascular disease, and any type of cancer. BMI was 
calculated from self-reported height and weight as BMI = weight (lb)/[height (in)]2 x 
703 (https://www.cdc.gov/healthyweight/assessing/bmi/adult_bmi/index.html). The 
remaining conditions were assessed using the following question: “Have you ever 
been diagnosed with any of the following conditions?” with the following four response 
options: 1) “Never”; 2) “Yes, I have in the past, but don’t have it now”; 3) “Yes I have, 
but I do not regularly take medications or receive treatment”; and 4) “Yes I have, and 
I am regularly taking medications or receiving treatment.” Respondents who answered 
that they have been diagnosed and chose either response 3 or 4 were considered as 
having the specified medical condition.
18–24 years versus adults aged 25–44 years (aPR = 1.5); and persons 
with disabilities§ versus those without disabilities (aPR = 1.3). Given 
this widespread reporting of medical care avoidance because of 
COVID-19 concerns, especially among persons at increased 
risk for severe COVID-19, urgent efforts are warranted to 
ensure delivery of services that, if deferred, could result in 
patient harm. Even during the COVID-19 pandemic, persons 
experiencing a medical emergency should seek and be provided 
care without delay (3).
During June 24–30, 2020, a total of 5,412 (54.7%) of 
9,896 eligible adults¶ completed web-based COVID-19 
Outbreak Public Evaluation Initiative surveys administered 
by Qualtrics, LLC.** The Human Research Ethics Committee 
of Monash University (Melbourne, Australia) reviewed and 
approved the study protocol on human subjects research. 
§ Persons who had a disability were defined as such based on a qualifying response 
to either one of two questions: “Are you limited in any way in any activities 
because of physical, mental, or emotional condition?” and “Do you have any 
health conditions that require you to use special equipment, such as a cane, 
wheelchair, special bed, or special telephone?” https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/
questionnaires/pdf-ques/2015-brfss-questionnaire-12-29-14.pdf. ¶ Eligibility to complete a survey during June 24–30, 2020, was determined 
following electronic contact of potential participants based on a minimum 
age of 18 years and residence within the United States. Age and residence were 
assessed using screening questions without indication of eligibility criteria before 
commencement of the earliest survey (recontacted respondents: April 2–8, 2020; 
first-time respondents: June 24–30, 2020). Residence was reassessed among 
recontacted respondents during June 24–30, and one respondent whose primary 
residence had changed to outside of the United States was excluded from the 
analysis. Country-specific geolocation verification via IP address mapping was 
used to ensure respondents were responding from the United States. Informed 
consent was obtained electronically during June 24–30, 2020, before enrollment 
into the study as a participant. All surveys underwent Qualtrics, LLC data quality 
screening procedures, including algorithmic and keystroke analysis for attention 
patterns, click-through behavior, duplicate responses, machine responses, and 
inattentiveness. Respondents who failed an attention or speed check, along with 
any responses that failed data quality screening procedures, were excluded from 
the analysis (6.6%).
** The COVID-19 Outbreak Public Evaluation (COPE) Initiative (www.
thecopeinitiative.org) is designed to assess public attitudes, behaviors, and 
beliefs related to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, and 
to evaluate the mental and physical health consequences of the pandemic. 
The COPE Initiative surveys included in this analysis were administered by 
Qualtrics, LLC (https://www.qualtrics.com/), a commercial survey company 
with a network of participant pools comprising hundreds of suppliers and 
with varying recruitment methodologies that include digital advertisements 
and promotions, word-of-mouth and membership referrals, social networks, 
television and radio advertisements, and offline mail-based approaches.

This activity was also reviewed by CDC and was conducted 
consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.††
Respondents were informed of the study purposes and provided 
electronic consent before commencement, and investiga￾tors received anonymized responses. The 5,412 participants 
included 3,683 (68.1%) first-time respondents and 1,729 
(31.9%) persons who had completed a related survey§§ during 
April 2–8, 2020. Among the 5,412 participants, 4,975 (91.9%) 
provided complete data for all variables in this analysis. Quota 
sampling and survey weighting¶¶ were employed to improve 
cohort representativeness of the U.S. population by gender, 
age, and race/ethnicity.
Respondents were asked “Have you delayed or avoided 
medical care due to concerns related to COVID-19?” Delay 
or avoidance was evaluated for emergency (e.g., care for 
immediate life-threatening conditions), urgent (e.g., care for 
immediate non–life-threatening conditions), and routine 
(e.g., annual check-ups) medical care. Given the potential 
for variation in interpretation of whether conditions were 
life-threatening, responses for urgent and emergency care 
delay or avoidance were combined for analysis. Covariates 
included gender; age; race/ethnicity; disability status; presence 
of one or more selected underlying medical conditions known 
to increase risk for severe COVID-19; education; essential 
worker status***; unpaid adult caregiver status; U.S. census 
region; urban/rural classification†††; health insurance status; 
whether respondents knew someone who had received a posi￾tive SARS-CoV-2 test result or had died from COVID-19; 
and whether the respondents believed they were at high risk 
for severe COVID-19. Comparisons within all these sub￾groups were evaluated using multivariable Poisson regression 
models§§§ with robust standard errors to estimate prevalence 
ratios adjusted for all covariates, 95% confidence intervals, and 
p-values to evaluate statistical significance (α = 0.05) using the 
R survey package (version 3.29) and R software (version 4.0.2; 
The R Foundation).

age, and race/ethnicity according to the 2010 U.S. Census.
*** Essential worker status was self-reported. For the aPRs, essential workers 
were compared with all other respondents (including those who were 
nonessential workers, retired, unemployed, and students).
††† Rural-urban classification was determined by using self-reported ZIP codes 
according to the Federal Office of Rural Health Policy definition of rurality. 
https://www.hrsa.gov/rural-health/about-us/definition/datafiles.html. §§§ Reference groups were chosen for ease of interpretation. For example, the 
household income level of $50,000–$99,999 was selected as the reference 
group because the median household income was $61,937 in the United 
States in 2018. https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/
publications/2019/acs/acsbr18-01.pdf.
As of June 30, 2020, among 4,975 U.S. adult respondents, 
40.9% reported having delayed or avoided any medical care, 
including urgent or emergency care (12.0%) and routine care 
(31.5%), because of concerns about COVID-19 (Table 1). 
Groups of persons among whom urgent or emergency care 
avoidance exceeded 20% and among whom any care avoid￾ance exceeded 50% included adults aged 18–24 years (30.9% 
for urgent or emergency care; 57.2% for any care), unpaid 
caregivers for adults (29.8%; 64.3%), Hispanic adults (24.6%; 
55.5%), persons with disabilities (22.8%; 60.3%), persons with 
two or more selected underlying medical conditions (22.7%; 
54.7%), and students (22.7%; 50.3%). One in four unpaid 
caregivers reported caring for adults who were at increased risk 
for severe COVID-19.
In the multivariable Poisson regression models, differ￾ences within groups were observed for urgent or emergency 
care avoidance (Figure) and any care avoidance (Table 2). 
Adjusted prevalence of urgent or emergency care avoidance 
was significantly higher among unpaid caregivers for adults 
versus noncaregivers (2.9; 2.3–3.6); persons with two or more 
selected underlying medical conditions versus those without 
those conditions (1.9; 1.5–2.4); persons with health insurance 
versus those without health insurance (1.8; 1.2–2.8); Black 
adults (1.6; 1.3–2.1) and Hispanic adults (1.5; 1.2–2.0) versus 
White adults; young adults aged 18–24 years versus adults aged 
25–44 years (1.5; 1.2–1.8); and persons with disabilities versus 
those without disabilities (1.3; 1.1–1.5). Avoidance of urgent 
or emergency care was significantly lower among adults aged 
≥45 years than among younger adults.
Discussion
As of June 30, 2020, an estimated 41% of U.S. adults 
reported having delayed or avoided medical care during the 
pandemic because of concerns about COVID-19, including 
12% who reported having avoided urgent or emergency care. 
These findings align with recent reports that hospital admis￾sions, overall emergency department (ED) visits, and the 
number of ED visits for heart attack, stroke, and hyperglycemic 
crisis have declined since the start of the pandemic (3–5), and 
that excess deaths directly or indirectly related to COVID-19 
have increased in 2020 versus prior years (2). Nearly one third 
of adult respondents reported having delayed or avoided rou￾tine medical care, which might reflect adherence to community 
mitigation efforts such as stay-at-home orders, temporary 
closures of health facilities, or additional factors. However, if 
routine care avoidance were to be sustained, adults could miss 
opportunities for management of chronic conditions, receipt 
of routine vaccinations, or early detection of new conditions, 
which might worsen outcomes.

* The types of medical care avoidance are not mutually exclusive; respondents had the option to indicate that they had delayed or avoided more than one type of 
medical care (i.e., routine medical care and urgent/emergency medical care).
† Statistical raking and weight trimming were employed to improve the cross-sectional June cohort representativeness of the U.S. population by gender, age, and 
race/ethnicity according to the 2010 U.S. Census.
§ The Rao-Scott adjusted Pearson chi-squared test was used to test for differences in observed and expected frequencies among groups by characteristic for 
avoidance of each type of medical care (e.g., whether avoidance of routine medical care differs significantly by gender). Statistical significance was evaluated at 
a threshold of α = 0.05.
¶ “Other” race includes American Indian or Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, or Other.
** Persons who had a disability were defined as such based on a qualifying response to either one of two questions: “Are you limited in any way in any activities 
because of physical, mental, or emotional condition?” and “Do you have any health conditions that require you to use special equipment, such as a cane, wheelchair, 
special bed, or special telephone?” https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/questionnaires/pdf-ques/2015-brfss-questionnaire-12-29-14.pdf. †† Selected underlying medical conditions known to increase the risk for severe COVID-19 included in this analysis were obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure, 
cardiovascular disease, and any type of cancer. Obesity is defined as body mass index ≥30 kg/m2 and was calculated from self-reported height and weight (https://
www.cdc.gov/healthyweight/assessing/bmi/adult_bmi/index.html). The remaining conditions were assessed using the question “Have you ever been diagnosed 
with any of the following conditions?” with response options of 1) “Never”; 2) “Yes, I have in the past, but don’t have it now”; 3) “Yes I have, but I do not regularly 
take medications or receive treatment”; and 4) “Yes I have, and I am regularly taking medications or receiving treatment.” Respondents who answered that they 
have been diagnosed and chose either response 3 or 4 were considered as having the specified medical condition.
§§ Essential worker status was self-reported.
¶¶ Unpaid caregiver status was self-reported. Unpaid caregivers for adults were defined as having provided unpaid care to a relative or friend aged ≥18 years at any 
time in the last 3 months. Examples provided to survey respondents included helping with personal needs, household chores, health care tasks, managing a 
person’s finances, taking them to a doctor’s appointment, arranging for outside services, and visiting regularly to see how they are doing.
*** Region classification was determined by using the U.S. Census Bureau’s Census Regions and Divisions. https://www2.census.gov/geo/pdfs/maps-data/maps/
reference/us_regdiv.pdf. ††† Rural-urban classification was determined by using self-reported ZIP codes according to the Federal Office of Rural Health Policy definition of rurality. https://
www.hrsa.gov/rural-health/about-us/definition/datafiles.html. §§§ For this question, respondents were asked to select the following statement, if applicable: “I know someone who has tested positive for COVID-19.”
Avoidance of both urgent or emergency and routine medical care 
because of COVID-19 concerns was highly prevalent among unpaid 
caregivers for adults, respondents with two or more underlying 
medical conditions, and persons with disabilities. For caregivers who 
reported caring for adults at increased risk for severe COVID-19, 
concern about exposure of care recipients might contribute to care 
avoidance. Persons with underlying medical conditions that increase 
their risk for severe COVID-19 (6) are more likely to require care 
to monitor and treat these conditions, potentially contributing 
to their more frequent report of avoidance. Moreover, persons at 
increased risk for severe COVID-19 might have avoided health care 
facilities because of perceived or actual increased risk of exposure to 
SARS-CoV-2, particularly at the onset of the pandemic. However, 
health care facilities are implementing important safety precautions 
to reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection among patients and 
personnel. In contrast, delay or avoidance of care might increase risk 
for life-threatening medical emergencies. In a recent study, states 
with large numbers of COVID-19–associated deaths also experi￾enced large proportional increases in deaths from other underlying 
causes, including diabetes and cardiovascular disease (7). For persons 
with disabilities, accessing medical services might be challenging 
because of disruptions in essential support services, which can 
result in adverse health outcomes. Medical services for persons with 
disabilities might also be disrupted because of reduced availability 
of accessible transportation, reduced communication in accessible 
formats, perceptions of SARS-CoV-2 exposure risk, and specialized 
needs that are difficult to address with routine telehealth delivery 
during the pandemic response. Increasing accessibility of medical 
and telehealth services¶¶¶ might help prevent delay of needed care.
Increased prevalences of reported urgent or emergency 
care avoidance among Black adults and Hispanic adults 
compared with White adults are especially concerning given 
increased COVID-19-associated mortality among Black 
adults and Hispanic adults (8). In the United States, the 
age-adjusted COVID-19 hospitalization rates are approxi￾mately five times higher among Black persons and four times 
higher among Hispanic persons than are those among White

persons (9). Factors contributing to racial and ethnic disparities 
in SARS-CoV-2 exposure, illness, and mortality might include 
long-standing structural inequities that influence life expec￾tancy, including prevalence and underlying medical conditions, 
health insurance status, and health care access and utilization, 
as well as work and living circumstances, including use of pub￾lic transportation and essential worker status. Communities, 
health care systems, and public health agencies can foster equity 
by working together to ensure access to information, testing, 
and care to assure maintenance and management of physical 
and mental health.
The higher prevalence of medical care delay or avoidance 
among respondents with health insurance versus those without 
insurance might reflect differences in medical care-seeking 
behaviors. Before the pandemic, persons without insurance 
sought medical care much less frequently than did those with 
insurance (10), resulting in fewer opportunities for medical 
care delay or avoidance.
The findings in this report are subject to at least five limita￾tions. First, self-reported data are subject to recall, response, 
and social desirability biases. Second, the survey did not assess 
reasons for COVID-19–associated care avoidance, such as 
adherence to public health recommendations; closure of 
health care provider facilities; reduced availability of public 
transportation; fear of exposure to infection with SARS-CoV-2; 
or availability, accessibility, and acceptance or recognition of

* Statistical raking and weight trimming were employed to improve the cross-sectional June cohort representativeness of the U.S. population by gender, age, and 
race/ethnicity according to the 2010 U.S. Census.
† Comparisons within subgroups were evaluated using Poisson regressions used to calculate a prevalence ratio adjusted for all characteristics listed, as well as a 
95% CI and p-value. Statistical significance was evaluated at a threshold of α = 0.05.
§ P-value calculated using Poisson regression among respondents within a characteristic is statistically significant at levels of p<0.05.

** Persons who had a disability were defined based on a qualifying response to either one of two questions: “Are you limited in any way in any activities because of 
physical, mental, or emotional condition?” and “Do you have any health conditions that require you to use special equipment, such as a cane, wheelchair, special 
bed, or special telephone?” https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/questionnaires/pdf-ques/2015-brfss-questionnaire-12-29-14.pdf. †† Underlying medical conditions were obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure, cardiovascular disease, and any type of cancer. Obesity is defined as body mass index 
≥30 kg/m2 and was calculated from self-reported height and weight (https://www.cdc.gov/healthyweight/assessing/bmi/adult_bmi/index.html). The remaining 
conditions were assessed using the question “Have you ever been diagnosed with any of the following conditions?” with response options of 1) “Never”; 2) “Yes, 
I have in the past, but don’t have it now”; 3) “Yes I have, but I do not regularly take medications or receive treatment”; and 4) “Yes I have, and I am regularly taking 
medications or receiving treatment.” Respondents who answered that they have been diagnosed and chose either response 3 or 4 were considered as having the 
specified medical condition.
§§ Essential worker status was self-reported. For the adjusted prevalence ratios, essential workers were compared with all other respondents (including those who 
were nonessential workers, retired, unemployed, and students).
¶¶ Unpaid caregiver status was self-reported. Unpaid caregivers for adults were defined as having provided unpaid care to a relative or friend aged ≥18 years at any 
time in the last 3 months. Examples provided to survey respondents included helping with personal needs, household chores, health care tasks, managing a 
person’s finances, taking them to a doctor’s appointment, arranging for outside services, and visiting regularly to see how they are doing.

telemedicine as a means of providing care in lieu of in-person 
services. Third, the survey did not assess baseline patterns of 
care-seeking or timing or duration of care avoidance. Fourth, 
perceptions of whether a condition was life-threatening might 
vary among respondents. Finally, although quota sampling 
methods and survey weighting were employed to improve 
cohort representativeness, this web-based survey might not 
be fully representative of the U.S. population for income, 
educational attainment, and access to technology. However, 
the findings are consistent with reported declines in hospital 
admissions and ED visits during the pandemic (3–5).
CDC has issued guidance to assist persons at increased risk 
for severe COVID-19 in staying healthy and safely following 
treatment plans**** and to prepare health care facilities to 
safely deliver care during the pandemic.†††† Additional public 
outreach in accessible formats tailored for diverse audiences 
might encourage these persons to seek necessary care. Messages 
could highlight the risks of delaying needed care, especially 
among persons with underlying medical conditions, and the 
importance of timely emergency care. Patient concerns related 
to potential exposure to SARS-CoV-2 in health care settings 
could be addressed by describing facilities’ precautions to 
reduce exposure risk.

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Delayed or avoided medical care might increase morbidity and 
mortality associated with both chronic and acute 
health conditions.
What is added by this report?
By June 30, 2020, because of concerns about COVID-19, an 
estimated 41% of U.S. adults had delayed or avoided medical 
care including urgent or emergency care (12%) and routine care 
(32%). Avoidance of urgent or emergency care was more 
prevalent among unpaid caregivers for adults, persons with 
underlying medical conditions, Black adults, Hispanic adults, 
young adults, and persons with disabilities.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Understanding factors associated with medical care avoidance 
can inform targeted care delivery approaches and communica￾tion efforts encouraging persons to safely seek timely routine, 
urgent, and emergency care.
Further exploration of underlying reasons for medical care 
avoidance is needed, including among persons with disabilities, 
persons with underlying health conditions, unpaid caregivers 
for adults, and those who face structural inequities. If care 
were avoided because of concern about SARS-CoV-2 expo￾sure or if there were closures or limited options for in-person 
services, providing accessible telehealth or in-home health care 
could address some care needs. Even during the COVID-19 
pandemic, persons experiencing a medical emergency should 
seek and be provided care without delay (3).
