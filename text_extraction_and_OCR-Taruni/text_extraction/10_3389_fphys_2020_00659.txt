Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) is a method for evaluating pulmonary and 
cardiocirculatory abnormalities, dyspnea, and exercise tolerance in healthy individuals 
and patients with chronic conditions. During exercise, ventilation (V˙ E) increases in proportion 
to metabolic demand [i.e., carbon dioxide production (V˙ CO2)] to maintain arterial blood 
gas and acid-base balance. The response of V˙ E relative to V˙ CO2 (V˙ E/V˙ CO2) is commonly 
termed ventilatory efficiency and is becoming a common physiological tool, in conjunction 
with other key variables such as operating lung volumes, to evaluate exercise responses 
in patients with chronic conditions. A growing body of research has shown that the 
V˙ E /V˙ CO2 response to exercise is elevated in conditions such as chronic heart failure (CHF), 
pulmonary hypertension (PH), interstitial lung disease (ILD), and chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease (COPD). Importantly, this potentiated V˙ E/V˙ CO2 response contributes 
to dyspnea and exercise intolerance. The clinical significance of ventilatory inefficiency is 
demonstrated by findings showing that the elevated V˙ E/V˙ CO2 response to exercise is an 
independent predictor of mortality in patients with CHF, PH, and COPD. In this article, 
the underlying physiology, measurement, and interpretation of exercise ventilatory efficiency 
during CPET are reviewed. Additionally, exercise ventilatory efficiency in varying disease 
states is briefly discussed.

INTRODUCTION
Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) is used for clinical evaluation of pulmonary and 
cardiocirculatory abnormalities, breathlessness (termed dyspnea), and exercise tolerance in 
patients with chronic conditions (Palange et  al., 2007). CPET is a helpful diagnostic tool that 
can aid clinicians to identify patterns of functional impairment that may not be  recognized 
by resting physiological testing (i.e., pulmonary function test, echocardiogram) and is particularly 
well suited to understand factors that may lead to pulmonary-related limitations to exercise 
(Stickland et  al., 2012). Further, emerging research suggests that resting physiological tests 
poorly predict exertional dyspnea and exercise intolerance in clinical populations and that 
CPET is vital to evaluate causes of previously unexplained dyspnea and exercise intolerance 
(Elbehairy et  al., 2015, 2017; Neder et  al., 2016; Boucly et  al., 2020).

During exercise, ventilation (V˙ E) increases in proportion to 
metabolic demand [i.e., carbon dioxide production (V˙CO2)] in 
order to maintain acid-base balance. The response of V˙E relative 
to V˙CO2 (V˙ E/V˙CO2), said to reflect ventilatory efficiency (Forster 
and Pan, 1988), has become a common physiological tool, in 
conjunction with other key variables such as operating lung 
volumes and subjective dyspnea ratings, to evaluate exercise 
responses in patients with chronic conditions. For clinicians 
to incorporate ventilatory efficiency into CPET interpretation, 
a thorough understanding of the background physiology of 
ventilatory efficiency is needed. This article provides a detailed 
review on the underlying physiology, measurement, and 
interpretation of exercise ventilatory efficiency during CPET. 
Additionally, exercise ventilatory efficiency in varying disease 
conditions is briefly discussed.
Ventilatory Responses During Exercise
Alveolar ventilation (V˙A) represents the ventilation which takes 
part in gas-exchange. The relationship between V˙A, CO2
production (V˙CO2), and the partial pressure of alveolar CO2
(PACO2) is defined by
P CA O C 2 2 =( ) V V   O / K A × (1)
where K is a conversion factor (normally  =  863) used to 
adjust V˙CO2 from standard temperature and pressure dry (STPD) 
to body temperature, ambient pressure, saturated (BTPS). As 
demonstrated by equation (1), PACO2 is determined by the relative 
balance of V˙CO2 and V˙A. Due to the difficulty in measuring 
PACO2, arterial PCO2 (PaCO2) is often used as a surrogate with 
the assumption that PACO2 ≈ PaCO2 (Enghoff, 1938). Well-matched 
alveolar ventilation to perfusion is critical to maximize ventilatory 
efficiency and minimize dead space ventilation (West and Dollery, 
1960; West et  al., 1964). Although the healthy lung generally 
has good matching of ventilation to perfusion (West and Dollery, 
1960; Whipp and Ward, 1982), a portion of gas remains in the 
conducting airways and does not participate in gas-exchange, 
and is termed anatomical dead space. Alveolar dead space represents 
the fraction of alveoli that are ventilated but not perfused. Dead 
space ventilation is the sum of alveolar and anatomical dead 
space, and, thus total minute ventilation is the sum of alveolar 
and dead space ventilation, as displayed in equation (2):
V V   V E A = + D (2)
Minute ventilation is measured at the mouth with expired 
gas analysis; however, V˙A and V˙ D are more difficult to determine. 
If arterial blood gas and expired gas data are available, it is 
possible to derive V˙A from equation (1), or estimate total 
physiologic dead space as a proportion of tidal volume using 
Enghoff ’s modified Bohr equation (Enghoff, 1938):
V V D T / / = − ( ) P Ca E O P 2 2 CO ( ) P Ca O2 (3)
In equation (3), PECO2 represents mixed expired partial 
pressures of CO2 and VT is tidal volume. It is often assumed 
that the end-tidal partial pressure of CO2 (PETCO2) can be  used 
as a surrogate for PaCO2. However, previous research has shown 
discrepancies between arterial blood-gas derived PaCO2 and 
expired-gas derived PETCO2 in patients with pulmonary 
gas-exchange abnormalities (Scheidl et  al., 2012; Laveneziana 
et al., 2014b; Elbehairy et al., 2015). Ventilation-perfusion (V˙A/Q˙) 
abnormalities (typically alveolar dead space) results in dilution 
of gas from poorly perfused alveoli, which lowers the end-tidal 
CO2 concentration. As a result, PETCO2 often underestimates 
PaCO2 in patients with increased alveolar dead space such as 
pulmonary hypertension (PH) and chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease (COPD; Scheidl et  al., 2012; Laveneziana et  al., 2014b;
Elbehairy et al., 2015). Because of the potential error in determining 
PaCO2 from end-tidal data, care should be given when interpreting 
dead space calculated only with end-tidal and mixed expired values.
Based on the equations outlined above, the total ventilatory 
requirement to remove metabolic CO2 production (V˙ E/V˙CO2) 
is elevated in the presence of alveolar hyperventilation and/or 
high dead space. In conditions of hyperventilation assuming 
normal dead space, V˙ E/V˙CO2 would be  elevated and PaCO2
lowered (Figure 1). As discussed below, many clinical conditions 
demonstrate hyperventilation during exercise, secondary to 
increased afferent feedback (including but not limited to skeletal 
muscle ergoreceptors, chemoreceptors, and baroreceptors) 
(Ponikowski et  al., 1997, 2001; Scott et  al., 2000; Farina et  al., 
2018). In conditions of increased total physiologic dead space 
(i.e., high VD/VT) during exercise, V˙ E must increase to maintain 
adequate V˙A and blood gas homeostasis (i.e., PaCO2; Figure  1). 
In addition to classic alveolar dead space (i.e., ventilation with 
no perfusion), VD/VT will be  elevated when patients adopt a 
shallow, tachypneic breathing response. Hyperventilation also 
results in a rightward shift in the overall V˙A/Q˙ relationship which 
can directly increase VD/VT (West, 1969; Robertson, 2015). In 
many chronic diseases, both elevated dead space and alveolar 
hyperventilation coexist (Figure  1) and, without measurement 
of PaCO2, it becomes difficult to quantify the contribution of each.
Clinical Significance of Ventilatory 
Efficiency
It is accepted that perceived dyspnea increases as ventilatory 
demand rises during incremental exercise, even in healthy 
individuals (Ofir et  al., 2008a,b; Faisal et  al., 2015). Ventilatory 
inefficiency increases the ventilatory demand for a given metabolic 
load which results in: (1) earlier attainment of critical dynamic 
mechanical constraint (i.e., critically reduced inspiratory reserve 
volume) and (2) increased respiratory neural drive, both of which 
lead to heightened perceived dyspnea and exercise intolerance, 
even in individuals with relatively preserved airway function 
(Guenette et  al., 2014; Faisal et  al., 2016). Multiple studies have 
linked ventilatory inefficiency to abnormal exertional dyspnea 
and poor exercise capacity in varying cardiocirculatory and 
respiratory diseases (Hansen and Wasserman, 1996; Arena et  al., 
2004; Neder et al., 2015, 2016; Elbehairy et al., 2017; Ewert et al., 
2019). Additionally, the elevated V˙E/V˙CO2 response to exercise is 
an independent predictor of poor outcomes and mortality in 
many diseases, including chronic heart failure (CHF), PH, and 
COPD (Ponikowski et al., 2001; Wensel et al., 2013; Neder et al., 
2016). Thus, the clinical utility of assessing ventilatory efficiency 
during CPET may be  helpful to explain reasons for exertional 
dyspnea and exercise intolerance in various underlying disease states.

MEASURING AND INTERPRETING 
VENTILATORY EFFICIENCY FROM CPET
V˙ E/V˙CO2 is easily included in a standard CPET report; however, 
careful consideration must be  taken when analyzing and 
interpreting the data. This section describes common methods 
of reporting ventilatory efficiency from CPET data and technical 
considerations that may influence interpretation.
V˙ E-to-V˙ CO2 Slope and y-Intercept
During incremental exercise to symptom limitation, the relationship 
between V˙ E and V˙CO2 can be  reported by plotting V˙ E (y-axis) 
relative to V˙CO2 (x-axis, Figure 2). The V˙ E-to-V˙CO2 relationship 
during exercise can then be  determined by analyzing the slope 
of this regression line (Whipp and Ward, 1982). Previous research 
has shown that the V˙ E-to-V˙CO2 slope lower and upper limits 
of normal range from approximately 21 to 31 units, respectively 
(Sun et  al., 2002; Naeije and Faoro, 2018). The V˙ E-to-V˙ CO2
slope is considered one of the most robust indicators of ventilatory 
efficiency, assuming ventilatory responses are not impaired by 
abnormal ventilatory mechanics (Neder et  al., 2017).
During light to heavy exercise, V˙ E changes as a linear function 
of V˙CO2. Importantly, at heavy exercise above the respiratory 
compensation point, V˙ E rises disproportionally to V˙CO2 due 
to excessive metabolic acidosis. In individuals who tolerate 
high levels of exercise, an upward inflection in the V˙ E relative 
to V˙CO2 response would occur at maximal exercise and would 
inflate the V˙ E-to-V˙CO2 slope if all data points are included in 
analysis. In these cases, determination of the slope of the 
regression line should exclude the non-linear portion (i.e., data 
after the respiratory compensation point should be  excluded) 
(Arena et  al., 2003; Guazzi et  al., 2005).
When analyzing the V˙ E-to-V˙CO2 slope in respiratory disease, 
such as COPD, the interpretation becomes more complex.

abnormal responses (closed circles). The theoretical abnormal responses demonstrate an elevated ventilatory response to carbon dioxide output (V˙ E/V˙ CO2), 
secondary to elevated dead space (dead space to tidal volume ratio = VD/VT) and normal partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide (PaCO2). The middle columns 
(B,E,H) display theoretical normal responses (open circles) and abnormal responses (closed circles). The theoretical abnormal responses demonstrate an elevated 
V˙ E/V˙ CO2, secondary to alveolar hyperventilation (reduced PaCO2) but relatively normal dead space. The right columns (C,F,I) display theoretical normal responses 
(open circles) and abnormal responses (closed circles). The theoretical abnormal responses demonstrate an elevated V˙ E/V˙ CO2, secondary to a combination of 
alveolar hyperventilation (reduced PaCO2) and elevated dead space.

Respiratory mechanical constraint and airflow limitation are 
often observed in these patients, which can blunt the rise in 
ventilation during exercise. As such, the V˙ E-to-V˙ CO2 slope 
paradoxically decreases as COPD severity worsens (Neder et al., 
2015) (see section COPD Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary 
Disease). Thus, clinicians must look beyond the V˙ E-to-V˙ CO2
slope when evaluating ventilatory efficiency from CPET, especially 
in patients with respiratory mechanical constraints.
In addition to the slope, the y-intercept of the V˙ E-to-V˙ CO2
relationship (i.e., V˙ E when V˙ CO2 = 0) can be determined from 
the same regression analysis (Figure 2). An elevated y-intercept 
is indicative of an upward shift in V˙ E for a given V˙ CO2 and 
is considered to be  an index of ventilatory efficiency at rest 
and during light exercise (i.e., at the start of a CPET) (Neder 
et  al., 2015). The y-intercept can be  a useful tool in the event 
of a premature test termination, as a maximal effort is not 
required. Recent research has demonstrated the y-intercept may 
help differentiate CPET patterns between COPD and CHF with 
overlapping symptoms (i.e., dyspnea and exercise intolerance), 
as COPD patients consistently demonstrate an elevated 
y-intercept, compared to CHF (Smith et  al., 2019).
V˙ E/V˙ CO2 Nadir
Generally, in the transition from light to moderate intensity 
exercise, PaCO2 remains constant or slightly increases, while 
VD/VT decreases. As a result, the V˙ E/V˙ CO2 ratio is elevated during 
light exercise at the start of a CPET and progressively decreases 
in tandem with VD/VT to its lowest value (nadir) 
just prior to the respiratory compensation point (Figure 2; Whipp 
and Ward, 1982). The nadir V˙ E/V˙ CO2 is often considered the 
most accurate assessment of ventilatory efficiency, as it occurs 
independent of (1) the excess V˙ E/V˙ CO2 response to low intensity 
exercise and (2) metabolic acidosis and respiratory compensation 
during heavy exercise (Whipp and Ward, 1982). In healthy 
individuals, the V˙ E/V˙ CO2 corresponding to the nadir and the 
V˙ E/V˙ CO2 at anaerobic threshold are often similar (Figure  2; Sun 
et  al., 2002). The nadir V˙ E/V˙ CO2 increases progressively with 
age and is abnormally high in cardiocirculatory and respiratory 
disease (Sun et  al., 2002; Ingle et  al., 2012; Elbehairy et  al., 2015, 
2019; Neder et al., 2015; Phillips et al., 2019). Although the nadir 
V˙ E/V˙ CO2 is highly reproducible, it may over-estimate ventilatory 
inefficiency in individuals with poor exercise tolerance and an 
excessively short test duration during CPET (Neder et  al., 2001).
V˙ E/V˙ CO2 at Peak Exercise
At peak exercise, V˙ E/V˙ CO2 is often much higher than the 
nadir value as individuals typically hyperventilate secondarily 
to excessive metabolic acidosis (Figure 2). However, in individuals 
with poor exercise tolerance who are generally unable to exercise 
above anaerobic threshold, the nadir and peak exercise V˙ E/V˙ CO2
values are often similar (Neder et al., 2015; Phillips et al., 2019). 
Peak exercise V˙ E/V˙ CO2 is considered a poor index of ventilatory 
efficiency in healthy individuals and in patients who can exercise 
above the anaerobic threshold (Neder et  al., 2017). For these 
reasons, clinicians should use caution when using peak exercise 
V˙ E/V˙ CO2 values as an index of ventilatory efficiency.
VENTILATORY EFFICIENCY IN VARIOUS 
CONDITIONS
Healthy Aging
Healthy aging is associated with an increased V˙ E/V˙ CO2 (slope 
and nadir) response to exercise, when compared to younger 
healthy individuals (Sun et  al., 2002; Faisal et  al., 2015). The 
elevated V˙ E/V˙ CO2 response is likely due to increased dead 
space, secondary to age-related reductions in alveolar-capillary 
surface area, capillary blood volume, and V˙ A/Q˙ mismatch 
(Tenney and Miller, 1956; Raine and Bishop, 1963; Johnson 
and Dempsey, 1991; Cardus et  al., 1997). However, age-related 
ventilatory inefficiency is generally not a primary cause of 
exercise limitation in older healthy individuals.
Chronic Heart Failure
Multiple studies have demonstrated that patients with CHF 
with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) have an elevated 
ventilatory response to exercise, which is a key contributor to 
exertional dyspnea and exercise intolerance. The elevated 
V˙ E/V˙ CO2 (slope and nadir) is generally ascribed to 
hyperventilation, secondary to increased afferent feedback from 
chemoreceptors, baroreceptors, and ergoreceptors (Ponikowski 
et  al., 1997, 2001; Scott et  al., 2000). CHF patients typically 
adopt a rapid-shallow breathing pattern, which would increase

the VD/VT ratio and contribute to a greater V˙ E/V˙ CO2 (Woods 
et  al., 2010). As described above, part of the increased VD/VT
in CHF is likely due to the hyperventilation itself, which results 
in a rightward shift of a normal V˙ A/Q˙ distribution to a higher 
mean V˙ A/Q˙ ratio, and greater dead space (Robertson, 2015). 
The contribution of both hyperventilation (low PaCO2) and 
elevated dead space contributing to an exaggerated V˙ E/V˙ CO2
is demonstrated by Johnson (2001) who further analyzed 
individual CHF exercise data from Franciosa et  al. (1984). A 
low peak PaCO2 was associated with a high peak V˙ E/V˙ CO2. 
Of note, a low cardiac index was also associated with a high 
V˙ E/V˙ CO2 (suggesting those with a low cardiac output likely 
have a higher mean V˙ A/Q˙ ratio and thus greater dead space). 
Finally, a high VD/VT ratio was correlated with a high V˙ E/V˙ CO2
(Franciosa et  al., 1984; Johnson, 2001). When combined, these 
data suggest both hyperventilation and increased dead space 
contribute to the increased V˙ E/V˙ CO2 during exercise in CHF.
Emerging work has demonstrated ventilatory inefficiency 
(elevated V˙ E-to-V˙ CO2 slope) in patients with CHF with preserved 
ejection fraction (HFpEF; Olson et  al., 2016); however, the 
mechanism(s) for the elevated V˙ E/V˙ CO2 is unclear. Patients 
with HFpEF often have co-existing PH (Lam et  al., 2009), 
which may help explain the elevated V˙ E-to-V˙ CO2 slope; however, 
future work is required to better understand the pulmonary 
gas-exchange abnormalities in this population.
Pulmonary Hypertension
PH is characterized by a heightened ventilatory response to 
exercise (i.e., elevated V˙ E-to-V˙ CO2 slope) (Sun et  al., 2001;
Zhai et  al., 2011). Patients with PH demonstrate significant 
ventilation-perfusion abnormalities, which is evident by an 
increased mean V˙ A/Q˙ ratio, larger than normal arterial-end￾tidal PCO2 differences, and increased dead space (VD/VT), all 
of which contribute to the elevated V˙ E/V˙ CO2 response during 
exercise (Dantzker et  al., 1984; Zhai et  al., 2011; Laveneziana 
et al., 2013). Although elevated dead space is generally considered 
the primary reason for ventilatory inefficiency in PH, previous 
work has shown that these patients hyperventilate at rest (as 
demonstrated by a low PaCO2) and demonstrate significant 
hyperventilation during exercise (Laveneziana et al., 2013, 2014a;
Farina et  al., 2018). Like CHF, patients with PH often have 
a blunted cardiac output response to exercise. The combination 
of low cardiac output and hyperventilation would cause a 
similar upward shift in the mean V˙ A/Q˙ ratio as observed in 
CHF, which may partially explain the elevated dead space 
typically observed in PH (Dantzker et al., 1984). When combined, 
it is evident that the increased V˙ E/V˙ CO2 response to exercise 
in PH is explained by both hyperventilation and increased 
dead space. Readers are referred to a review by Robertson 
(2015) that provides an excellent summary of current 
understanding of factors contributing to exercise hyperventilation 
in patients with cardiocirculatory disease.
Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease
Airflow limitation, secondary to dynamic respiratory mechanical 
abnormalities, is generally considered the primary cause of 
exertional dyspnea in COPD. However, emerging research has 
suggested that ventilatory inefficiency is also a key contributor 
to dyspnea and exercise intolerance in patients with COPD 
(Neder et al., 2015; Elbehairy et al., 2019). In a study examining 
patients with mild COPD, arterial blood gas-derived dead space 
and V˙ E/V˙ CO2 (slope, nadir, and y-intercept) were consistently 
elevated during exercise while PaCO2 and alveolar ventilation 
were similar to age-matched healthy controls (Elbehairy et  al., 
2015). These data suggest that ventilatory inefficiency during 
exercise in mild COPD is primarily due to elevated dead space.
With advancing COPD (moderate to very severe), the 
V˙ E/V˙ CO2 response to exercise is more complex. With increasing 
COPD severity, dead space increases and is markedly elevated 
in the presence of extensive emphysematous destruction of 
capillary beds (Rodriguez-Roisin et al., 2009). In these patients, 
the elevated anatomical and total dead space is further amplified 
by the adopted rapid and shallow breathing pattern, secondary 
to severe hyperinflation, critically low inspiratory reserve volume, 
and limited tidal volume expansion (O᾽Donnell et  al., 2012). 
Additionally, patients with COPD often become hypoxemic 
(Stolz et  al., 2014), which would stimulate peripheral 
chemoreceptors and further increase ventilatory drive. The 
pronounced dead space and reduced PaO2 combined with a 
rapid shallow breathing would result in a substantially elevated 
V˙ E/V˙ CO2 response at rest and during light exercise; however, 
the pronounced airflow limitation in these patients often results 
in an inability to increase ventilation appropriately at higher 
metabolic demands. The net result is that patients with moderate 
to very severe COPD typically demonstrate an increased 
V˙ E-to-V˙ CO2 y-intercept and nadir V˙ E/V˙ CO2 but low V˙ E-to￾V˙ CO2 slope and V˙ E/V˙ CO2 at peak exercise (Neder et al., 2015).
Interstitial Lung Disease
A growing body of research has shown that pulmonary 
gas-exchange abnormalities and ventilatory inefficiency (i.e., 
elevated V˙ E/V˙ CO2 slope and nadir) are key mechanisms of 
dyspnea and exercise intolerance in patients with interstitial lung 
disease (ILD; Faisal et  al., 2016; Schaeffer et  al., 2018). The 
increased V˙ E/V˙ CO2 during exercise in ILD appears to be  due 
to the combination of increased dead space and hyperventilation 
(Agusti et al., 1991; Faisal et al., 2016). During exercise in patients 
with ILD, dynamic restrictive mechanical constraints, secondary 
to increased lung elastic recoil, increase inspiratory elastic loading, 
and patients often adopt a more rapid and shallow breathing 
pattern during exercise to minimize the inspiratory elastic work 
of breathing (Faisal et al., 2016; Schaeffer et al., 2018). Although 
the reduction in tidal volume is an effective strategy to minimize 
the elastic work of breathing during exercise, the compensatory 
tachypnea increases anatomical dead space and, ultimately, 
V˙ E/V˙ CO2 (Faisal et  al., 2016; Schaeffer et  al., 2018).
Multiple studies have consistently shown that patients with 
ILD develop exercise-induced arterial hypoxemia, which would 
stimulate the peripheral chemoreceptors and increase ventilatory 
drive, ultimately increasing V˙ E/V˙ CO2 (Hamer, 1964; Agusti 
et  al., 1991; Faisal et  al., 2016). Patients with ILD, specifically 
idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, often have PH which may worsen 
pulmonary gas-exchange and exacerbate the already elevated

ventilatory response to exercise (Lettieri et  al., 2006; Nathan 
et al., 2007); however, future work is required to better understand 
how abnormal pulmonary hemodynamics affects pulmonary 
gas-exchange in this population.
CONCLUSIONS
Measurement of ventilatory efficiency, as determined by the 
V˙ E/V˙ CO2 response to exercise, is an important physiological 
component, in conjunction with other key variables, to evaluate 
exercise responses and help explain reasons for exertional 
dyspnea in different underlying disease states. While 
measurements of ventilatory efficiency can aid clinicians to 
interpret CPET results, it is important to understand the 
strengths and limitations of the various methods of 
interpreting ventilatory efficiency data and understand the 
underlying pathophysiology.
