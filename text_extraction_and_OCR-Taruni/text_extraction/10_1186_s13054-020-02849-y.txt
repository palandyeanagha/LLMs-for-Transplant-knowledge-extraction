Background
In bifemoral venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxy￾genation (VA ECMO), the transition point at which the
antegrade pulsatile output from the left ventricle and the
retrograde non-pulsatile ECMO output collide is re￾ferred to as watershed [1]. Currently, no standard
method is available to determine its location. Occasion￾ally, contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) or
angiography has been used [1–3]. Both techniques, how￾ever, bear disadvantages including radiation exposure
and use of iodinated contrast media. We assessed the
feasibility and safety of contrast-enhanced ultrasound
(CEUS) to detect the watershed at the bedside in pa￾tients on bifemoral VA ECMO at three ICUs of a Euro￾pean tertiary care facility.
Methods
CEUS was performed as soon as possible after ECMO￾initiation (Cardiohelp, Maquet, Germany) using Sono￾Vue contrast media (Bracco, Italy). Transesophageal
echocardiography (x7-2t probe) and transabdominal
sonography (3–5 MHz curvilinear probe) were per￾formed concomitantly to display mid-esophageal aortic
valve, ascending, descending aorta, and upper esophageal
aortic arch long-axis views as well as longitudinal views
of the proximal (below diaphragm), mid (level of renal
arteries), and distal (above iliac bifurcation) abdominal
aorta. The mechanical index was set to 0.05–0.10 field
of view. Prior to CEUS, the arterial bubble sensor acti￾vating zero-flow mode was disabled. The acoustic alarm
was kept active. The presence or absence of pulsatility in
the left radial artery was documented.
One milliliter of SonoVue was administered via the
venous drainage cannula, followed by a flush of 10 ml
normal saline. The obtained images were evaluated
qualitatively. If a watershed area was not able to be visu￾alized, contrast-enhanced blood flow was classified into
“pulsatile” or “continuous” to discriminate between car￾diac and ECMO blood flow. The feasibility of CEUS was
assessed based on qualitative image evaluation, the
amount of contrast media administered, and the rate of
bubble detection. Secondary outcomes were safety and
frequency of radial arterial pulsatility. Safety variables in￾cluded ECMO settings, hemodynamics, and neurologic
assessment and were obtained over a 6-h period after
CEUS.

The variables are presented as absolute values (n), rela￾tive frequencies (%), and median (25–75% IQR). We used
random-effects general linear regression models to esti￾mate mean changes for each safety variable (mean ± SD).
Results
Between August 2018 and April 2019, ten patients were
enrolled (Table 1). Qualitative detection of watershed lo￾cation by CEUS was feasible using 1 ml contrast media.
In five patients, the watershed could be clearly shown in
the abdominal aorta, seconds after contrast media
administration (Fig. 1). In the remaining five patients,
contrast-enhanced continuous blood flow was visible
throughout the abdominal and thoracic aorta indicating
watershed location close to the aortic root. The pulsati￾lity of the left radial arterial waveform and opening of
the aortic valve was present in all patients. Acoustic bub￾ble detection occurred in all patients after CEUS. No
changes in the safety variables related to CEUS occurred
(Table 1). CT imaging of the brain (8/10 patients)
showed no cerebral lesions suggesting particle
embolism.

Discussion
This study assessed the feasibility of CEUS for watershed
detection at the bedside in patients on bifemoral VA
ECMO. CEUS was apparently safe and provided real￾time assessment of the watershed or contrast-enhanced
continuous blood flow in the aorta. Increasing evidence
indicates that CEUS is safe in critically ill patients, and
application areas are ever-expanding [4–6]. In bifemoral
VA ECMO, CEUS may help to identify patients at risk
for differential hypoxia, given that left radial arterial pul￾satility was present in all study patients, including those
in whom the watershed was located near the aortic root.
Limitations
Transthoracic suprasternal echocardiography may be
useful to localize the watershed in the aortic arch but
has not been tested. Furthermore, no reference imaging
technique has been used to assess the performance of
CEUS, because no standard method for the detection of
the watershed is available, and no repeated measure￾ments were performed.
