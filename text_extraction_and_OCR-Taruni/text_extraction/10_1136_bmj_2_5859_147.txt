Value of an ACTH Test in Assessing Hypothalamic￾Pituitary-Adrenocortical Function in Glucocorticoid-treated
Patients
HENRIK KEHLET, CHRISTIAN BINDER
British Medical Jrournal, 1973, 2, 147-149
Summary
Forty-eight patients receiving glucocorticoid treatment were
tested with ACTH stimulation using a', 24 ACTH (tetraco￾sactrin). All patients subsequently underwent non-acute
major surgery without any glucocorticoid administration, and
their clinical course and plasma corticosteroids were followed
closely. No case of adrenocortical insufficiency was observed.
A highly significant correlation was found between the pre￾operative adrenocortical response to ACTH and the hypo￾thalmic-pituitary-adrenocortical (H.P.A.) response to surgery.
A normal response to ACTH stimulation was never followed
by a greatly impaired H.P.A. response to surgery.
It seems that a simple ACTH stimulation test is reliable in
predicting the integrated H.P.A. response to major stress in
glucocorticoid-treated patients.
Introduction
It has been shown that treatment with glucocorticoids may
cause impaired function of the hypothalamic-pituitary
adrenocortical (H.P.A.) axis (Treadwell et al., 1963). Gener￾ally, the insulin and the pyrogen tests are used to evaluate the
integrated function of the H.P.A. axis. These tests show
whether a patient is able to respond to stress situations and
they are used to determine if a glucocorticoid-treated patient
needs extra glucocorticoids in such situations (Plumpton et al.,
1969). However, these tests are time consuming and have un￾pleasant side effects, which make them less suitable for rou￾tine use.
In the present study we show that a simple preoperative
ACTH stimulation test can predict the response of the
H.P.A. axis to the stress of major surgery.
Material and Method
Three groups of patients and normal subjects were studied.
Twenty-eight were patients who had never received gluco￾corticoids who were studied during major surgical procedures
(see table), 26 were normal subjects who were stimulated

pared for immediate therapy directed against adrenocortical
insufficiency. After this period treatment with glucocorticoids
was started again. All patients gave informed consent to the
examinations.
The patients were anaesthetized with thiopental, suxa￾methonium, halothane, and N20 + 02 or neurolept anaesthe￾sia. The interval between the induction of anaesthesia and the
start of the operation was always less than 20 minutes. Blood
samples for plasma corticosteroid determinations were taken
at the time of skin incision, one hour later, and at intervals
throughout 24 hours postoperatively. The duration of opera￾tion was always more than one hour. Plasma corticosteroids
were measured fluorometrically by a modification of Matting￾ly's (1962) method (Binder, 1972).
Results
PATIENTS NOT TREATED WITH GLUCOCORTICOIDS
In 26 normal subjects studied with an ACTH stimulation test
plasma corticosteroids increased by an average of 20 (range
12 to 31) to an average concentration of 37 ,ug/100 ml (range
24 to 60 ,ug/100 ml) 30 minutes after ACTH injection. In 28
patients studied during major surgery the mean concentration
of plasma corticosteroids one hour after skin incision was 41
,tg/100 ml (range 30 to 60 ,ug/100 ml). Three to four hours
after skin incision the mean concentration of corticosteroids in
plasma was 46 ,ug/100 ml (range 26 to 74 ,ug/100 ml). Accord￾ingly the following responses were regarded as normal.
ACTH Test.-Increase in plasma corticosteroids by more
than 12 and to a concentration of more than 24 ,ug/100 ml 30
minutes after ACTH injection.
HP.A. Response to Major Surgery.-Plasma corticosteroids
should be higher than 30 ptg/100 ml one hour, and higher
than 26 ,tg/100 ml 3-4 hours after skin incision.
GLUCOCORTICOID-TREATED PATIENTS
Of 48 glucocorticoid-treated patients, 17 showed a normal
and 31 an impaired response to ACTH. Of the 17 patients
with a normal response to ACTH, 13 also showed a normal
H.P.A. response to surgery measured one hour after skin
incision. Plasma corticosteroid concentrations in the remain￾ing four patients were 23, 27, 28, and 28 ,ug/100 ml one hour
after skin incision and thus only slightly lower than normal.
Three hours after skin incision plasma corticosteroid concen￾trations in these four patients were 28, 23, 31, and 34 ,ug/100
ml, and thus within normal range in three and slightly sub￾normal in one patient. All patients with a normal response
to ACTH and operation one hour after skin incision also
showed a normal response 3-4 hours after skin incision. Of the
31 patients with an impaired response to ACTH, 25 also
showed an impaired H.P.A. response to operation one hour
after skin incision. Sixteen of the 25 patients had normal
plasma corticosteroid concentrations 3-4 hours after skin in￾cision. The patients with an impaired response to ACTH but
normal response one hour after skin incision also showed a
normal response 3-4 hours after skin incision.
The correlation between increase in plasma corticosteroids
after ACTH and the concentration of corticosteroids in plasma
one hour after skin incision is shown in fig.
2. The correlation between the concentration of
corticosteroids in plasma 30 minutes after in￾jection of ACTH and the concentration of corticosteroids in
plasma one hour after skin incision is shown in fig. 3. It
appears that there is a highly significant (P < 0-001) and a
high degree (r = 083 and 0-82) of correlation between the
preoperative adrenocortical response to ACTH and the inte￾grated H.P.A. response to major surgical stress. In no case

was a normal response to ACTH followed by a greatly re￾duced H.P.A. response to operation.
The results of the ACTH stimulation test were also com￾pared to the concentrations of plasma corticosteroids 3-4
hours after skin incision, showing a similar high degree of cor￾relation (r = 0-74, P < 0-001; and r = 0-75, P < 0-001, res￾pectively). Again, none of the patients with a normal response
to ACTH elicited any greatly impaired H.P.A. response to
operation.
None of the patients showed any symptoms of manifest
acute adrenocortical insufficiency and none were given sub￾stitution with glucocorticoids. The clinical course in these
patients has been described elsewhere (Kehlet and Binder,
1973).

Discussion
The purpose of evaluating the hypothalamic-pituitary￾adrenocortical (H.P.A.) function in glucocorticoid-treated
patients is to select those patients with impaired function who
will have to have supplementary glucocorticoids in stress
situations.
Some authors have warned against the use of an ACTH
stimulation test in the assessment of the H.P.A. function as
it describes only the adrenocortical function and not the
hypothalamic-pituitary function, which has been reported to
be suppressed independently (Engel et al., 1958; Holub et al.,
1959; Robinson et al., 1962; Brinck-Johnsen et al., 1963; Jas￾ani et al., 1967). In some of these studies, however, the intense
and prolonged ACTH stimulation may have promoted an
adrenocortical response, which should not be compared to the
response to the shorter and more physiological H.P.A. test.
The present investigation was carried out in order to show
whether the response to a short stimulation with ACTH cor￾relates with the integrated H.P.A. function during subse￾quent major surgery in glucocorticoid-treated patients. Our
results show a high degree of correlation, and in no case was
a normal preoperative response to ACTH followed by a
greatly impaired H.P.A. response to surgery. In a similar
study, Jasani et al. (1968) found a slightly impaired H.P.A.
response to surgery in a few glucocorticoid-treated patients
who showed a normal response to ACTH but a subnormal
response to the insulin test. Obviously, the insulin test is the
most sensitive test in the assessment of the H.P.A.
function (Jasani et. al., 1967; Plumpton et al., 1969; British
Medical 7ournal, 1970). But based on the results of the present
study it seems to us most unlikely that a preoperative normal
response to ACTH will be followed by a greatly impaired
H.P.A. response to major stress and it is concluded that a sim￾ple ACTH test is of value in predicting the integrated H.P.A.
response to major stress in glucocorticoid-treated patients.
It is also to be expected that the ACTH test will be of
value in patients previously treated with glucocorticoids, as
the hypothalamic-pituitary system is restored before the
adrenal cortex after cessation of glucocorticoid therapy
(Graber et al., 1965).

Summary
In sheep the administration of single intramuscular injections
of dexamethasone into the fetus was shown to be an effective
method of initiating parturition. In a controlled trial in
women who had gone beyond the 41st week of pregnancy 20
mg betamethasone in saline (six patients) or saline alone
(five patients) was injected into the amniotic fluid. In the
betamethasone-treated group delivery occurred 78-9 ± 10-2
(S.D.) hours after injection while in the control group it oc￾curred 323 ± 62 (S.D.) hours after injection (P < 001). In
one woman with an anencephalic pregnancy intra-amniotic
injection failed to initiate parturition but delivery occurred
885 hours after intramuscular injection of betamethasone in￾to the fetus.

Introduction
The obstetric induction of labour presents particular prob￾lems in a developing country. All existing methods require
careful observation of the mother between the beginning of
the induction and delivery. This can place an almost intoler￾able pressure on an already overloaded service. We have
therefore attempted to test a new method which can be car￾ried out as an outpatient procedure and which allows the
woman to return home until an apparently normal labour
begins a few days later.
Liggins and his co-workers have been largely responsible
for developing the concept that the secretion of cortisol by
the fetal adrenal is a key factor in the initiation of labour
(Liggins, et al., 1967; Liggins and Kennedy, 1968;
Liggins, 1968, 1969). Fetal cortisol also seems to play a
major part in lung maturation and a naturally initiated nor￾mal delivery is usually a good indication that the lungs are
mature and that respiratory distress is unlikely (Howatt. et
al., 1965; Liggins, 1968, 1969). Liggins showed that prema￾ture labour could be induced in sheep by infusion of gluco￾corticoids into the fetus and that the lambs born as a result
of this procedure could sustain respiration at a stage in de￾velopment when this was not normally possible. Intrauterine
fetal infusion is clearly not a simple method of inducing lab￾our, and we therefore attempted to show that in sheep a
single injection of glucocorticoid into the fetus could initiate
labour without obvious ill effects on either fetus or mother.
Having done this, we also attempted by means of a con￾Protected by copyright, including for uses related to text and data mining, AI training, and similar technologies.
