Abstract
Background: Mild hypophosphatasia (HPP) phenotype may result from ALPL gene mutations
exhibiting residual alkaline phosphatase activity or from severe heterozygous mutations exhibiting
a dominant negative effect. In order to determine the cause of our failure to detect a second
mutation by sequencing in patients with mild HPP and carrying on a single heterozygous mutation,
we tested the possible dominant effect of 35 mutations carried by these patients.
Methods: We tested the mutations by site-directed mutagenesis. We also genotyped 8 exonic and
intronic ALPL gene polymorphisms in the patients and in a control group in order to detect the
possible existence of a recurrent intronic mild mutation.
Results: We found that most of the tested mutations exhibit a dominant negative effect that may
account for the mild HPP phenotype, and that for at least some of the patients, a second mutation
in linkage disequilibrium with a particular haplotype could not be ruled out.
Conclusion: Mild HPP results in part from compound heterozygosity for severe and moderate
mutations, but also in a large part from heterozygous mutations with a dominant negative effect.
Background
Loss of function mutations in the ALPL gene (MIM
171760) result in hypophosphatasia (HPP) (MIM
146300, 241500, 241510), an inherited disorder charac￾terized by defective bone and teeth mineralization and
deficiency of serum and bone alkaline phosphatase (AP)
activity [1-3]. The gene codes for tissue-nonspecific alka￾line phosphatase (TNSALP), a homodimeric phosphomo￾noesterase anchored at its carboxyl terminus to the
plasma membrane by a phosphatidylinositol-glycan moi￾ety [4,5]. Severe forms of the disease (perinatal and infan￾tile) are transmitted as an autosomal recessive trait while

both autosomal recessive and dominant transmission can
cause milder forms [1,6-10]. We, along with other groups,
have previously showed that ALPL gene mutations could
exhibit a dominant negative effect leading to a mild HPP
phenotype in heterozygotes [11-14]. This dominant nega￾tive effect may be due to the inhibition of the activity of
the wild-type (WT) monomer by the mutated monomer
in heterodimers [11,13,14] or to the sequestration of the
WT protein by the mutated one into the Golgi apparatus,
preventing it from being transported to the membrane
[12]. Carriers of such mutations may not obviously
express the disease. In molecular diagnosis, the detection
of a single heterozygous mutation in a patient with mild
HPP means that a second mutation remains undetected
(intronic mutations or mutations in the regulatory
sequence) or that the heterozygous mutation has a domi￾nant negative effect. We and others previously showed
that the measurement of in vitro AP activity in COS cells
transfected by the mutated cDNA of ALPL correlates with
the HPP phenotype [15-21], and that the dominant nega￾tive effect of mutations may be tested by co-transfecting
mutated and WT cDNAs [13,14,21]. Such a tool may
therefore help to distinguish true heterozygosity from
compound heterozygosity with an undetected mutation.
Indeed, a dominant negative effect of a mutation may
indicate true heterozygosity while the absence of such
effect may suggest compound heterozygosity, i.e. the
existence of another undetected mutation.
In order to evaluate how often we could have missed a sec￾ond mutation in patients with mild HPP where only one
mutation was identified, we tested by site-directed muta￾genesis the possible dominant effect of 35 mutations car￾ried by these patients. In addition, we genotyped 8 exonic
and intronic ALPL gene polymorphisms in the patients
and in a control group. This approach should reveal the
possible existence of a recurrent undetected intronic
mutation detectable by linkage disequilibrium (LD) that
could be the cause of the detection failure.
The results show that most of the tested mutations exhibit
a dominant negative effect that may account for the mild
HPP phenotype of the patients, and for some of the
patients, a second mutation in LD with a particular haplo￾type could not be ruled out.
Methods
Patients
Informed consent was obtained from all patients and/or
their parents for screening the ALPL gene mutations. The
study was conducted in compliance with the recomman￾dations of the Comité de Protection des Personnes and
with the Helsinki Declaration. In this study mild HPP
refers to childhood and adult HPP, odontohypophos￾phatasia, and perinatal benign HPP, while severe forms
are the perinatal and infantile forms. All the patients were
unrelated and of apparent European ancestry (Europe,
Canada, USA, Australia). We also studied a control group
consisting of 74 unrelated patients with severe HPP and
carrying two mutations or a homozygous mutation.
SNPs
All the 8 SNPs studied here are located inside the ALPL
gene and were genotyped by sequencing during our diag￾nosis procedure. These SNPs were: c.787T>C
(rs3200254), c.793-31C>T, c.862+20G>T (rs2275377),
c.862+51G>A (rs2275376), c.862+58C>T (rs2275375),
c.863-12C>G, c.863-7T>C and c.876A>G (rs17433807).
Haplotyping was determined by parental DNA analysis
when available and/or by deduction from the genotype
when in the patient one SNP was heterozygotic and the
others homozygotic.
Statistical analysis
Significance of differences between groups of patients was
tested by a standard chi-square (χ2) test.
Mutation detection
The primer sequences of the 12 exons were previously
reported [22] and allowed analysis of the whole coding
sequence, including intron-exon borders and untrans￾lated exons. PCR reactions were performed and analyzed
as previously described [22]. The existence of each muta￾tion was confirmed by generating and sequencing a new
PCR product obtained independently of the former one,
and when possible, by the analysis of parental DNA.
Transfection studies
A full-length WT cDNA of the ALPL gene was obtained by
reverse transcription/PCR (RT-PCR) with Pyrococcus furio￾sis DNA polymerase (Stratagene, USA) and standard
molecular biology methods. Mutated cDNAs were
obtained directly from the normal cloned cDNA by using
the Quikchange Site-Directed Mutagenesis kit (Strata￾gene). The mutated cDNAs were fully sequenced to make
sure that the target mutation was inserted and that no
other mutation was inserted. Mutated or WT plasmids
were transiently transfected in COS-7 cells for 48 hours.
Transfections were performed with Lipofectamine and
PLUS reagent (Invitrogen) by using the methodology rec￾ommended by the manufacturer. The plasmid pcDNA3.1/
His/lacZ containing the β-galactosidase gene was used as
a positive control of transfection and expression. The cells
were treated as previously described [20] and ALP and β￾galactosidase activities were determined by monitoring
the absorbance at 409 nm and 450 nm respectively. Total
AP activity was measured with a COBAS Integra 800 auto￾mate (Roche) and was weighted with β galactosidase
activity. The pcDNA3.1 vector is designed with a strong
promoter so that endogeneous AP activity is neglectible in

regard to the inserted gene expression. The quantitative
control of transfections and the results were expressed in
percent of WT cDNA activity (% WT) taken as reference.
For each mutation, experiments were repeated at least
four times independently.
The dominant negative effect of mutations was tested by
means of co-transfection of COS-7 cells with 50% of WT
and 50% of mutant plasmids, according to reference [13].
In these conditions, the absence of dominant negative
effect was expected to be 50% WT, while a dominant neg￾ative effect was expected to be less than 50%. In this study
the threshold between dominant and recessive mutations
was set at 40%. This means that mutations between 40
and 50% WT were considered as being without dominant
negative effect although they could have a slight domi￾nant negative effect.
3D-modeling
A 3D model of the TNAP molecule has been previously
constructed by using the homology of TNAP with human
placental alkaline phosphatase whose crystal structure has
been determined [23,24]. The missense mutations dis￾cussed here were localized using the open source PyMOL
software http://www.pymol.org/.
Results
Among the 361 samples from unrelated patients sent to
our laboratory to explore the possible diagnosis of hypo￾phosphatasia by molecular analysis of the ALPL gene, 241
were found to carry at least one single mutation. The other
120 cases were considered to be affected by other pathol￾ogies, sometimes identified later, such as campomelic
dysplasia or osteogenesis imperfecta. However, we cannot
exclude that, despite exhaustive sequencing of the coding
sequence and intron/exon borders, some patients were
affected with HPP and carried undetected mutations. We
detected two mutated alleles in 131 (94.9%) of the 138
severe HPP patients (table 1), a proportion expected for
recessively inherited disorders when such a sequencing
methodology is used. By contrast only 54 of the 103
patients with mild HPP carried two mutated alleles, and
the proportion of detected mutations increased with the
severity of the disease (table 1). When tested by site￾directed mutagenesis, at least one of the mutations found
in these patients produced significant in vitro residual AP
activity (table 2), and where therefore considered as mod￾erate alleles. The second mutation, when identified, was
mostly a severe allele (not shown), indicating that most of
these patients were compound heterozygotes for a moder￾ate allele and a severe one. The moderate mutation
c.571G>A (p.E191K) was found in 55% of these patients,
associated with another mutation, confirming its high fre￾quency in HPP patients from European ancestry [25-27].
For patients with only one heterozygous mutation, clini￾cal symptoms in the parent carrying the mutation were
reported in only 30% (14/47) of cases (table 3), mostly
loss of teeth in infancy or adulthood, or slight features
such as bad teeth, fractures without obvious cause or sag￾ital synostosis at birth. In most of the cases, however, a
careful clinical survey of the parents of the patients was
not performed.
Table 3 summarizes the results of site-directed mutagene￾sis for 35 mutations found in 47 patients with mild HPP
and carrying a single heterozygous mutation. Two muta￾tions were not tested because they corresponded to a
frameshift mutation and to a mutation that we failed to
introduce in the ALPL cDNA by site-directed mutagenesis.
Twenty-four of the mutations, representing 36 patients
(76.6%) were found to exhibit a dominant negative effect.
The dominant negative effect of mutations affecting
patients with childhood HPP was slightly stronger (27.9%
WT ± 9.2) than patients with odonto and adult HPP
(32.5% WT ± 5.9), but the difference was not statistically
significant. Interestingly we observed that these mutations
were located in particular areas of the 3D model of the
protein (figure 1), namely the active site, the crown
domain and the homodimer interface. None are located
in the calcium site or in the rest of the molecule. The
affected domains are clearly involved in allosteric proper￾ties of the enzyme and dimerization, and it is therefore
understandable to find the mutations with a dominant
negative effect in these regions. In order to clarify the
cause of the HPP phenotype in the 11 remaining patients

carrying mutations with no evidence of a dominant nega￾tive effect, we studied the distribution of SNP alleles in the
patients and in a control group. The distribution of SNP
alleles in the ALPL gene showed marked variations from
one population to another [28,29]. We therefore consid￾ered other HPP patients as the best control group because
they were recruited from similar areas and in similar pro￾portions compared to mild HPP patients with one muta￾tion. We also compared our results with the dbSNP http:/
/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?db=snp and Hap￾Map http://www.hapmap.org/ databases when the SNPs
tested here were present in those databases. A total of 12
haplotypes were observed, 4 of which were frequent (table
4). This indicates a strong LD between the SNPs of the
ALPL gene, as previously reported [25,30]. In particular,
the markers c.862+20G>T, c.862+51G>A, c.863-12C>G,
c.863-7T>C and c.876A>G were found in very strong,
almost complete, LD. While other haplotypes showed
similar distributions in mild HPP patients and in the con￾trol group (Tables 4), the haplotype E, defined by the
allelic combination c.787C, c.793-31C, c.862+20T,
c.862+51A, c.862+58T, c.863-12G, c.863-7C and c.876G,
was found 3 times more frequently in patients with one
mutation (p = 1.4 10-3). This suggests LD between E and
an undetected mutation in a subset of the population car￾rying this haplotype. Alternatively, a pathogenic effect of
the SNP c.862+58T or of a combination of SNPs cannot
be ruled out although their high frequencies in various
populations [28,29] does not argue for such a pathogenic
effect. In order to test this hypothesis we studied by semi￾quantitative RT-PCR the expression of the ALPL gene in
cultured cells of 12 unrelated persons from the general
population, 9 carrying E and 9 carrying other haplotypes
(not shown). We did not find any difference in regard to
splicing and RNA quantity. However, it remains possible
that these polymorphisms have an impact on the AP activ￾ity itself, which was not tested here (see discussion). In
patients where the information was available, we
observed that E was in the same proportions in patients
with dominant or recessive mutations, and either in trans
(on the chromosome that does not carry the mutation) or
in cis (on the chromosome that carries the mutation)
(Table 3). This was not expected because a disease-causing
mutation in LD with E should be more frequent in
patients with recessive mutations, and should be found
more often in trans.
Discussion
We show here that a large part of mild HPP (i.e. childhood
and adult HPP, odontohypophosphatasia, and perinatal
benign HPP) is due to heterozygosity for missense muta￾tions with a dominant negative effect, and that the other
part is mostly due to compound heterozygosity for mild
and severe alleles. The dominant mutations are severe
alleles that inhibit the normal monomer when both the
normal and the mutated protein form a dimer. The in vitro
inhibition level varied from 19% WT (p.D378V) to 40%
WT (p.I72T) that we chose as the upper limit for a domi￾nant effect. Mutations with activities slightly above this
threshold could have a dominant negative effect, but over￾lapping standard deviations of experimental results made
the distinction with recessive mutations impossible.
Among the 13 remaining patients, 5 carried mutations
with significant residual in vitro AP activity: p.A176T
(30.2%), p.E191K (56%), p.G249V (34.5%), p.I490F
(37.1%) and p.R136H (33.4%). Due to their AP activity
and to their frequency in mild HPP patients with two
mutations (table 2), p.A176T, p.E191K and p.R136H are
clearly mild alleles and it is very likely that the patients
carry a second allele not detected by our diagnosis proce￾Table 1: Detection rate of ALPL mutations in the patients according to their clinical form

dure. This is not the case for mutations p.G249V and
p.I490F. When co-transfected with the WT allele, the
mutation p.G249V does not exhibit a dominant negative
effect by inhibition. However we previously showed that
this mutation has a dominant negative effect by sequestra￾tion of the wild type protein in the Golgi apparatus [12]
and thus this mutation should be also classified as domi￾nant Similarly to p.G249V, p.I490F is located on the sur￾face of the molecule, and it is therefore possible that the
mutation exhibits a similar effect, but this remains to be
demonstrated. The eight other patients carry severe alleles
without evidence of an in vitro dominant effect. It is there￾fore possible that these patients harbor a second mutation
not detected by sequencing. Due to the mild phenotype of
the patient, such a mutation would be a moderate allele,
ruling out a large deletion. An intronic mutation or a
mutation in the regulatory sequence could account for
these patients, in particular a recurrent mutation in LD
with haplotype E could affect patients 37, 39 and 41. But
the high frequency of E in the group of patients when
compared to the control group suggests that E itself, or a
mutation in LD, may play a role in the risk for developing
mild HPP. We did not demonstrate any effect of the hap￾lotype on ALPL RNA expression. However, E may have an
effect on the enzyme activity itself. Interestingly the SNP
c.787T>C that substitutes tyrosine for histidine at position
263 was previously shown to affect the catalytic property
of TNAP and bone mineral density (BMD) in old Japanese
women [30,31]. In these studies, the less frequent allele in
the Japanese population, allele T, increased the Km and
decreased the BMD, and should be therefore considered
as the "at risk" allele. By contrast, our study shows that
allele C, the less frequent allele in European populations,
is associated with haplotype E and should be therefore
considered "at risk". The contradiction argues in favor of
a causal mutation in LD with C in our HPP patients, rather
than in favor of the role of c.787T>C polymorphism itself.
The methodology of cotransfection used here may help
the molecular biologist to determine if a patient with mild
HPP carries one or two mutated alleles. However, looking
at alkaline phosphatase activity in just one cell type, and
measuring alkaline phosphatase activity alone should be
completed by other studies, especially experiments allow￾ing the detection of abnormalities in intracellular process￾ing and migration, and to distinguish them from changes

in catalytic activity on the external surface of cells. Also, it
is possible that differences in the RNA expression of the
defective allele compared to WT would affect in vitro
assessment of the mutation. This should be addressed in
the future to fully understand phenotype-genotype rela￾tionships in hypophosphatasia.
Conclusion
In conclusion we show here that mild HPP can result from
either compound heterozygosity for severe and moderate
mutations, but also in a large part from heterozygous
mutations with a dominant negative effect. A sequence
variation in LD with haplotype E could in addition play
the role of an aggravating factor resulting in loss of haplo￾sufficiency.
