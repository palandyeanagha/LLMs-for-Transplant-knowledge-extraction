Abstract
Aim of the study: To investigate the long-term outcome of surgical treatment for congenitally corrected
transposition of the great arteries (CCTGA), in patients with biventricular repair with the right ventricle as systemic
ventricle.
Methods: A total of 32 patients with CCTGA were operated between January 1972 and October 2008. These
operations comprised 18 patients with a repair with a normal left ventricular outflow tract, 11 patients with a
Rastelli repair of the left ventricle to the pulmonary artery and 3 patients with a cardiac transplantation.
Results: Excluding the cardiac transplantation patients, mean age at operation was 16 years (sd 15 years, range
1 week - 49 years). Median follow-up was 12 years (sd 10 years, range 7 days - 32 years). Survival obtained from
Kaplan-Meier analysis at 20 years after surgery was 63% (CI 53-73%). For the non-Rastelli group these data at 20
years were 62% (CI 48-76%) and for the Rastelli group 67% (CI 51-83%). Freedom of reoperation at 20 years was
32% (CI 19-45%) in the overall group. In the non-Rastelli group the data at 20 years were 47% (CI 11-83%) and for
the Rastelli group 21% (CI 0-54%) after almost 19 years.
Conclusions: Long term follow up confirms that surgery in CCTGA with the right ventricle as systemic ventricle
has a suboptimal survival and limited freedom of reoperation. Death occurred mostly as a result of cardiac failure.
Background
Congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries
(CCTGA) is a rare cardiac anomaly with an incidence of
less than 1% of patients with congenital heart disease
[1]. Characteristically the right atrium is connected to
the morphologically left ventricle, which connects to the
pulmonary artery and the left atrium is connected to the
morphologically right ventricle, which connects to the
aorta, resulting in atrio-ventricular discordance and ven￾triculo-arterial discordance, or double discordance [2].
In 90% of these patients associated anomalies are pre￾sent as well, with ventricular septal defect as the most
common, followed by pulmonary stenosis and atrial
septal defect [1,3-5].
The prognosis of patients with CCTGA is variable with
some patients showing satisfactory long-term survival
[1,5-7]. However, both deteriorating right ventricular
function on the long-term, as well as associated anoma￾lies have an adverse effect on outcome. For instance a
ventricular septal defect, pulmonary stenosis or arrhyth￾mia have been found to limit the prognosis [6,8].
Repair with the right ventricle staying the systemic
ventricle, including the Rastelli approach in case of sub￾pulmonary obstruction [9], has for many years been
conducted to correct CCTGA [2,5,10]. Ultimately, this
often results in tricuspid valve regurgitation, dysfunction
of the right ventricle and eventually heart failure
[1,11,12]. In trying to improve this suboptimal outcome
in CCTGA, the double-switch operation was introduced
[6,8,13-15]. In this procedure, the left ventricle is incor￾porated as systemic ventricle and the right ventricle and
tricuspid valve are no longer part of the systemic circu￾lation. This approach is often referred to as being an
anatomic repair [16-21]. Indeed, satisfying early and
intermediate results were confirmed [22].

In a recent publication, however, no differences in the
long-term survival rates between patients undergoing
either repair could be found [17]. Furthermore, the
superiority of the double-switch operation compared to
the conventional repair could not be demonstrated in
patients who had no tricuspid regurgitation before
operation [17,23]. The finding of left ventricular
dysfunction and issues related to new or residual valvu￾lar (aortic valve and tricuspid valve) incompetence and
arrhythmias prevented the double switch operation
(either with arterial switch or with conduit connection
from right ventricle to pulmonary artery) to be labelled
as the management of choice in CCTGA [24]. However,
for patients who suffer from significant tricuspid valve
regurgitation, the double switch repair is suggested to
be an adequate treatment [17].
The purpose of this study was to present further
results with regard to long term survival of repair in
CCTGA with the right ventricle in the systemic circula￾tion, in order to further contribute data in this challen￾ging congenital anomaly.
Materials and methods
Patients
All 32 patients with CCTGA and two adequate ventri￾cles who were surgically treated in the Erasmus MC
between January 1972 and October 2008 were included
in this series.
Detailed data of each patient were obtained from
hospital records. All but four of the patients were
under follow up in our centre. These four patients
moved abroad and their data were censored at their
last visit. The three patients with a cardiac transplanta￾tion were not included in the Kaplan-Meier analyses of
survival and freedom from reoperation. The transplant
procedures were done at ages 33, 34 and 47 years
respectively for end-stage right ventricular failure in
CCTGA.
The records were also analyzed for information on
anatomy of the proximal coronary arteries. At the end
of follow-up, dysfunction of the right ventricle and
regurgitation of the tricuspid valve were graded subjec￾tively as normal or mildly, moderately or severely
reduced. Other variables included were New York Heart
Association (NYHA) class (I, II, III or IV) and the need
for a pacemaker.
Statistical analysis
Data were analyzed using SPSS 15.0 for Windows (SPSS,
Chicago, Il, USA). Patient survival rate and freedom
from reoperation were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier
curves. Cox regression analyses were used for analysing
risk factors for mortality.
Non-Rastelli group
The non-Rastelli group comprised 18 patients who were
operated with preservation of the left ventricular outflow
tract. In this group in the early part of the study 3 patients
were treated with a pulmonary banding. The indication
for surgery in this group was atrial septal defect in one
patient, severe tricuspid valve regurgitation in four
patients and ventricular septal defect (combined with
atrial septal defect and pulmonary stenosis in three
patients, with atrial septal defect in two patients, with
atrial septal defect and pulmonary stenosis in one patient,
with atrial septal defect, severe tricuspid valve regurgita￾tion and pulmonary stenosis in one patient and with
severe tricuspid valve regurgitation in one patient) in
13 patients. All ventricular septal defects were closed
with a prosthetic patch. In 11 of the patients the tricuspid
valve showed no regurgitation and in one a moderate
regurgitation was left untouched. In the patients with
pulmonary stenosis, this concerned valvular pulmonary
stenosis and was treated with pulmonary valvotomy.
In all six patients with severe tricuspid valve regurgitation
the tricuspid valve was replaced with a prosthetic valve.
Three patients had an Ebstein anomaly of the tricuspid
valve. Two of them had severe regurgitation.
Rastelli group
In 11 patients a Rastelli procedure was carried out. In
six of these 11 patients a pulmonary arterial banding
was done as a previous palliative procedure. In all of
these patients a VSD was present. In 9 patients there
was pulmonary stenosis and in 2 a pulmonary atresia.
In 5 of them an ASD was present.
In all patients the ventricular septal defect was closed
with a prosthetic patch and the pulmonary stenosis or
atresia was treated with a conduit from the left ventricle
to the pulmonary artery. Tricuspid valve regurgitation
was diagnosed as moderate in one patient. No further
anomalies were present in this group of patients.
Cardiac transplantation
In three patients end-stage systemic ventricular dysfunc￾tion was the reason for cardiac transplantation at ages
33, 34 and 47 respectively. These three patients had an
intact atrial and ventricular septum and an adequate
subpulmonary outflow. One patient had a dextrocardia
and a long history of cardiac failure before transplanta￾tion. The second patient also had a dextrocardia, with
additionally mitral and aorta regurgitation, resulting in
cardiac failure, finally leading to cardiac transplantation.
The third patient had a pacemaker implantation for
complete atrioventricular block, 11 years earlier, and
suffered from end-stage right and left heart failure
before undergoing cardiac transplantation.

Results
The mean age at surgery for the 29 non-transplant
patients was 13.8 years (sd 13.5 years, range 1 week - 48.7
years). This was 17 years (sd 16 years, range 1 week - 49
years) in the Non-Rastelli group, and 8 years (sd 5 years,
range 2 - 17 years) in the Rastelli group. The mean follow￾up period was 11.5 years (sd 9.8 years, range 7 days - 32.0
years).
Coronary anatomy
In 13 out of the 32 patients information on coronary
anatomy was explicitly available. In one patient a cir￾cumflex coronary artery arose from the right coronary
artery. In two patients a single coronary orifice was
described. In two patients a coronary branch crossed
the subpulmonary outflow tract. In eight patients the
coronary arteries were described as fitting with CCTGA.
This means that, connected to the right posterior aortic
sinus, the right-sided left coronary artery with its left
anterior descending and circumflex branches supplies
the right-sided left ventricle and, connected to the left
posterior aortic sinus, the right coronary artery with its
posterior descending branch provides the left-sided right
ventricle.
In 19 patients, information on coronary arterial anat￾omy was not described, and original catheterization
films were no longer available.
Pacemaker
Total atrioventricular block, with pacemaker insertion,
occurred in two patients prior to cardiac surgery (one in
the later non-Rastelli group, one in the later Rastelli
group).
In the early part of the series, surgery related atrioven￾tricular block, necessitating implantation of a permanent
pacemaker occurred in seven patients (six in the non￾Rastelli group, one in the Rastelli group).
Postoperative atrioventricular block necessitating a
permanent pacemaker occurred in an additional three
patients (two in the non-Rastelli group, two and 16
years after surgery and one in the Rastelli group, three
years after surgery).
At a medium of 12 years (range 7 days - 32 years) of
follow up a total of 12 out of 29 patients (41%) had a
permanent pacemaker.
No significant difference between the groups was
found with regard to pacemaker implantation.
Tricuspid valve regurgitation
In six patients the tricuspid valve was replaced at the
primary procedure (all in the non-Rastelli group). In
two patients the moderate tricuspid valve regurgitation
was left untouched in the non-Rastelli group. In an
additional nine of the remaining 20 patients, moderate
to severe tricuspid valve regurgitation developed during
a mean follow up of 10 years (sd 9 years, range 1 month
- 24 years). In four patients (all in the non-Rastelli
group) the tricuspid valve was replaced at a median of
15 years (sd 10 years, range 2 - 24 years) after primary
surgery.
Tricuspid valve regurgitation was more often seen in
the non-Rastelli group. We found no correlation with
right ventricular failure.
Right ventricular failure
At the end of follow-up 14 (seven in the non-Rastelli
group, seven in the Rastelli group) of the 20 patients were
suffering from right-ventricular dysfunction, in 12 of them
(six in the non-Rastelli group, six in the Rastelli group)
progressively, resulting in 10 patients (six in the non￾Rastelli group, four in the Rastelli group) with moderate to
severe failure. In 4 of these 14 patients (two in the non￾Rastelli group and two in the Rastelli group), there was
mild right ventricular dysfunction. In 6 patients there was
normal right ventricular function. In three of these
6 patients (two in the non-Rastelli group, one in the Ras￾telli group) failure was diagnosed at presentation, but after
surgery the function of the right ventricle improved to
normal.
Surprisingly, the NYHA class at the end of follow-up
of these 20 patients was found to be NYHA I in 11
patients. Five patients were in NYHA class II, three of
these patients suffered moderate ventricular failure and
in the other two patients no right ventricular failure was
found at rest. One patient was in NYHA class III.
Unfortunately, in three patients no information with
regard to their NYHA class was available.
The three patients who were treated with cardiac
transplantation all had a severely failing right ventricle
resulting in severe shortness of breath, classified as
NYHA class III before transplantation.
Mortality
Nine patients in our series died, two early and seven
during follow up.
Early mortality was due to sepsis after a non-Rastelli
procedure in one patient and, in the early part of the
series, to cardiac failure associated with atrioventricular
block in another non-Rastelli patient.
Seven patients died during follow up (four in the non￾Rastelli group and three in the Rastelli group). In the
non-Rastelli group a patient of seven years old died 10
months after surgery following a pacemaker implanta￾tion in relation to anoxia with resulting neurological
damage. Another patient of seven years old died three
years after surgery due to congestive heart failure with a

failing right ventricle. A 19 years old patient died 5.5
years after surgery from end-stage cardiac failure. A 35
years old patient died 23.5 years after surgery due to
progressive cardiac failure and pneumonia.
In the Rastelli group one patient of 3 years old died of
pneumosepsis, confirmed at autopsy, 5 months after the
procedure. Two patients died 11 years and 14 years
after surgery, unfortunately no details on mode of death
are available.
Survival rates of the patients in our series are repre￾sented in Figure 1. The survival at 10, 20 and 30 years
after surgery was 74% (CI 65-83%), 63% (CI 53-73%)
and 52% (CI 38-66%) respectively. For the non-Rastelli
group these data at 10, 20 and 25 years were 62% (CI
48-76%), 62% (CI 48-76%) and 42% (CI 23-61%) respec￾tively. For the Rastelli group the data at 10, 20 and 25
years were 89% (CI 78-100%), 67% (CI 51-83%), and
67% (CI 51-83%) respectively.
Reoperation
In 12 patients reoperations were done. These were done
a mean of 10 years (sd 8 years, range 0.7 - 24 years)
after primary surgery.
In the non-Rastelli group six patients were reoperated
after a mean of 11 years (sd 11, range 0.7 - 26 years). In
five of them newly developed tricuspid valve regurgita￾tion was treated with replacement of the tricuspid valve
with a prosthetic valve. In one of these patients a central
atrial septal defect was closed, that had been left open at
primary surgery. In another one of these patients a resi￾dual ventricular septal defect was closed as well.
In the Rastelli group six patients were reoperated after
a mean of 9 years (sd 7, range 0.7 - 19 years). In all six
of them a conduit replacement was carried out, com￾bined with tricuspid valve replacement for newly devel￾oped tricuspid valve regurgitation in two patients and
combined with closure of a residual ventricular septal
defect in three patients. In four patients a second con￾duit replacement was done.
Freedom of reoperation was found to be 65% (CI 54-
76%), 32% (CI 19-45%) and 32% (CI 19-45%) after 10, 20
and 25 years respectively in the overall group. In the
non-Rastelli group the freedom of reoperation at 10, 20
and 25 years was 78% (CI 56-100%), 47% (CI 11-83%)
and 47% (CI 11-83%) respectively. In the Rastelli group
the freedom of reoperation was 56% (CI 23-88%) and
21% (CI 0-54%) after 10 and almost 19 years respectively.
The freedom of reoperation is depicted in Figure 2.
Discussion
Survival after surgical repair in CCTGA with a right
ventricle as systemic ventricle has been evaluated in
different studies [1,5,7,11,25]. The mid-term results are
often reported as satisfactory. Some studies describe no
significant changes in right ventricular ejection fraction
or limitation of exercise intolerance over an observation
period of 10 years [25]. However, others state that the
prognosis in CCTGA mainly depends on the presence
of associated anomalies, on significant tricuspid valve
regurgitation or on right ventricular dysfunction
[5,7,11]. The quality of life in this regard may be limited
due to diminished exercise performance and deteriora￾tion of NYHA class and may lead to a 50% mortality
due to right ventricular failure at a mean age of 38.5
years (sd 12.5) [1].
The overall survival in our study does not differ signif￾icantly from other studies. A 20-year survival of 48 to
75% has been reported [5,26,27]. In our series the
20-year overall survival was 63%. Shin’oka et al. [17] had
a 32-year survival of 62.4% in their non-Rastelli group
and 78.5% after 27 years in their Rastelli group. Our
results show a survival at 25 years after surgery of 42%

in the non-Rastelli group and of 67% in the Rastelli
group (Figure 1).
Significant risk factors for right ventricular dysfunc￾tion over time were found to be tricuspid valve regurgi￾tation, complete atrioventricular block, the need for
pacemaker therapy and arrhythmias [5,8,11,12]. Deterio￾rated right ventricular function was diagnosed in 56% of
45-year old patients with CCTGA and with associated
anomalies [8]. In surgical repair in CCTGA with the
right ventricle as systemic ventricle, an association can
be recognized between right ventricular dysfunction and
suboptimal results.
The expected better systemic ventricular function was
the reason for the pursuit of anatomic repair [13]. In
the short-and midterm follow-up of the double switch
procedure for CCTGA a reduction of complications was
shown [13,20,22,28]. However, different studies in
patients undergoing anatomic repair procedures could
not show a reduction of systemic ventricular dysfunction
[14,16,17,24]. Understandably, an uncertainty on the
value of anatomic repair in CCTGA emerged. Due to
left ventricular dysfunction, to new or residual valvular
dysfunction of the aortic and tricuspid valve and to
arrhythmias, anatomic repair could not be labelled as
the ideal management option in CCTGA [24]. In addi￾tion, the incidence of heart block was reported to be
higher in the anatomic repair group resulting in more
pacemaker implants [17,22,24].
In case of severe tricuspid valve regurgitation, the ana￾tomic repair is more likely to increase the survival rate
than conventional repair [12,17]. However, when no tri￾cuspid valve regurgitation is present preoperatively, a
survival rate of even 72% at 30 years can be reached
with conventional repair [17].
In this regard, tricuspid valve regurgitation occurs
frequently in patients with CCTGA at long-term follow￾up after conventional repair [3,7,11]. In patients with
normal tricuspid valve function in CCTGA, undergoing
conventional biventricular repair without any interven￾tion on the tricuspid valve, 52 to 67% developed moder￾ate or severe regurgitation after three to 10 years of
follow-up [5,12,28]. However, others found that only a
morphologically abnormal tricuspid valve was signifi￾cantly associated with occurrence of tricuspid valve
regurgitation and that only 26% of the patients had
increasing tricuspid valve regurgitation, following often
early after open-heart surgery within a follow up of
12 years [11].
In some series tricuspid valve regurgitation at follow￾up was a predictor for reoperation [17], but this could
not be confirmed in the present series or by others [18].
Overall freedom from reoperation was reported to be
80% at five years and 64% after 32 years in conventional
groups and 97 at five years and 77% after 27 years in a
Rastelli group [17]. After double switch operation 86%
freedom of reintervention at five years is reported [18].
Our results fit well with these data, the early results
being more promising then the long-term outcome.
Especially when tricuspid valve regurgitation or abnorm￾alities are diagnosed, anatomic repair can be considered
above conventional procedures [5,17].
To accomplish a retraining of the involved left ventri￾cle in preparation for a double switch procedure, a pre￾paratory banding of the pulmonary artery has been
applied. In the double switch procedure, this is consid￾ered to increase the risk of deterioration of the function
of the morphologically left ventricle over time compared
to patients whose ventricle does not require training
[29]. Whether or not this is related to limited capacity
for remodelling of the myocardium, to abnormal coron￾ary arterial anatomy, to limited coronary arterial adapta￾tion capacity or to other factors is yet unknown.
However, an important finding is the abnormal pattern

of coronary arterial anatomy in CCTGA [30]. Although
the information in our study was incomplete, a word of
caution may be relevant with regard to an increased
incidence of abnormal anatomy of the proximal coron￾ary arteries.
Limitations of this study
In general, CCTGA has a low incidence and a variable
presentation, which complicates grouping of data. In
addition, surgical procedures and standards have chan￾ged over time and have different periods of follow-up
observations. Therefore, abstractions on patient outcome
and results should be interpreted with caution. Our
study is retrospective in nature and unfortunately no
quantitative data were available on systemic ventricular
function.
Conclusions
Our series confirms that in long term follow up, surgery
in CCTGA with the right ventricle as systemic ventricle
has a suboptimal survival and limited freedom of reo￾peration. There is an increased incidence of abnormal
anatomy of the proximal coronary arteries. An impor￾tant number of patients will need tricuspid valve repla￾cement at either primary or later surgery. An important
number of patients will need a pacemaker at any stage
of observation. Death occurred mostly as a result of car￾diac failure.
