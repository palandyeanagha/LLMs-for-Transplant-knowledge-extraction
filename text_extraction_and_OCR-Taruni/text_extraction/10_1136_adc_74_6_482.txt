Nitric oxide production in critically ill patients
Hector RWong, Joseph A Carcillo, Gilbert Burckart, Sandra S Kaplan
Abstract
Objective-To measure serum nitrite and
nitrate levels in critically ill children as
indicators of endogenous nitric oxide
(NO) production.
Hypothesis-Endogenous NO production
is increased in children with conditions
characterised by immune stimulation.
Design-Prospective descriptive study in
a multidisciplinary paediatric intensive
care unit.
Patients-137 consecutive critically ill
children with a variety of clinical condi￾tions.
Interventions-Using a rapid microtitre
plate technique, daily serum nitrite and
nitrate levels were measured from serum
samples that remained in the clinical
laboratory after daily routine phlebotomy.
Clinical and laboratory information was
also gathered daily for each patient.
Results-The maximum serum nitrite
plus nitrate levels (pM) reached by chil￾dren with infection (41.8 (SD 18.1)), sepsis
syndrome (85.1 (39.9)), shock without
sepsis (36.4 (19.1)), transplantation alone
(61.0 (43.4)), transplantation with sepsis
(200.7 (150.5)), or rejection (161.7 (70.4)),
were higher than in controls (18.1 (9.3)).
In the absence of exogenous NO donors,
levels greater than 80 FM were reached
only in children with the sepsis syndrome,
organ transplantation, or acute rejection.
Conclusions-Increased endogenous NO
production occurs in children with clini￾cal conditions associated with immune
stimulation. Further investigation is war￾ranted to determine the value of this
simple and rapid test as a clinically useful
diagnostic tool and therapeutic monitor in
the evaluation of children at risk for the
sepsis syndrome or acute allograft rejec￾tion.

Keywords: nitric oxide, sepsis, transplantation.
In 1983 Wagner et al reported increased
urinary nitrates in rats injected with endo￾toxin.' During the next decade endogenously
produced nitric oxide (NO) was identified as
the source of this increase in nitrate and as an
important effector molecule in proinflamma￾tory conditions such as sepsis.2 Serum nitrite
and nitrate, the stable oxidative end products
of NO, have been reported in multiple animal
and human studies as an indirect measure of in
vivo whole body NO production.3457 We3
and other investigators45 have reported in￾creased endogenous NO production in pa￾tients with the sepsis syndrome. These clinical
studies are consistent with laboratory studies
showing increased NO production in various
mammalian cell types after stimulation with
proinflammatory mediators.89 Immune stimu￾lation, characterised by the elaboration of
proinflammatory mediators, also occurs after
solid organ transplantation, and during al￾lograft rejection and infectious processes.
Accordingly, increased NO production mani￾fest as increased serum nitrite and nitrate levels
is also likely to occur in these clinical
conditions.'0 Increased serum nitrite and ni￾trate levels may also be expected in clinical
states which are not classically associated with
immune activation. For example patients expe￾riencing hypotension during haemodialysis'l or
chronic heart disease'2 have increased endog￾enous NO production. Administration of exog￾enous NO (either as inhaled NO or as intrave￾nous NO donors) and decreased metabolism
or elimination of serum nitrite and nitrate (at
either the renal or hepatic level) are other
potential causes of increased serum levels of
these metabolites.
The development of a rapid microtitre plate
technique to measure serum nitrite and nitrate
levels allows for the potential use of these mea￾surements as a clinical tool to evaluate endog￾enous NO production. Serum nitrites and
nitrates are stable end products of NO produc￾tion, not immediate indicators of NO produc￾tion. In vitro studies show that nitrite and
nitrate levels may not be detectable until 24
hours after immune stimulation and NO
production.89 Accordingly, a clinical state
associated with increased NO production may
not show increased nitrite and nitrate levels if
evaluated too early in its evolution. Therefore,
questions regarding increased NO production
in specific clinical states may be more accu￾rately evaluated by measuring the maximum
nitrite and nitrate level attained during the
course of an illness.

Nitric oxide production in critically ill patients
Table I Criteria for the diagnosis of the sepsis syndrome
1. Clinical suspicion of infection
2. Hyperthermia (rectal temperature > 38'G) or hypothermia (rectal temperature < 35.0'C)
3. Tachycardia (heart rate > 2 SD above the appropriate mean for age)
and
4. At least one of the following manifestations of inadequate or altered organ function and perfusion:
* Altered mental status (appropriate for age)
* Hypoxaemia (Pao2 < 72 torr (9.5 kPa)) breathing room air, overt pulmonary disease not the direct cause of hypoxaemia
* Increased plasma lactate level
* Oliguria (urine output < 0.5 ml/kg/h for at least one hour not due to decreased preload)
* Delayed capillary refill ( > 5 seconds)
* Bounding peripheral pulses
Although increased serum nitrite and nitrate
levels have been reported in two studies of
neonates and children with the sepsis syn￾drome,57 no such information exists regarding
the general and critically ill paediatric popula￾tions. The purposes of this prospective survey
were: (1) to establish a range ofvalues of serum
nitrite and nitrate in critically ill children in
whom increased NO is not expected (that is, in
children without infection, sepsis, transplanta￾tion, rejection, or shock, and not being treated
with exogenous NO donors); (2) to establish
that serum nitrite and nitrate levels are a
reasonable representation of NO by showing
that nitrite and nitrate levels correlate with the
concentration of exogenous NO donors re￾ceived; (3) to establish that the maximum level
of serum nitrite and nitrate reached by children
with diseases thought to be associated with
increased endogenous NO production (that is,
infection, sepsis, shock without sepsis, trans￾plantation, or rejection) are higher than the
maximum level reached by critically ill children
in whom endogenous NO production is most
probably not increased; and (4) to examine the
possibility that the use of threshold serum
nitrite and nitrate levels may have clinical value
as indicators or therapeutic monitors either at
the time of diagnosis or during the course of
illness in critically ill children with the sepsis
syndrome or allograft rejection.
Methods
PATIENTS, DESIGN, AND DATA GATHERING
Since no blood was drawn solely for study pur￾poses, the human rights committee of Chil￾dren's Hospital of Pittsburgh waived the need
for parental consent. The intensive care unit at
the Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh is a 23
bed tertiary multidisciplinary care facility that
admits a complex population of surgical and
medical patients. All children admitted to the
intensive care unit were studied prospectively
over a predetermined two month period.
Patients were prospectively assigned daily, by
an investigator unaware of serum concentra￾tions of nitrite and nitrate, to one of the follow￾ing defined groups: (1) exogenous NO: patients
receiving exogenous sources of NO either as
inhaled NO or as intravenous NO donors
(sodium nitroprusside or glyceryl trinitrate);
(2) infection: patients with a culture proven
focus of infection (that is, bacteraemia, urinary
tract infection, pneumonia) but not meeting
criteria for the sepsis syndrome; (3) sepsis
syndrome: see table 1 for definition based on a
modification of the criteria of Bone et al13
previously published by us7; (4) shock without
sepsis: hypotension not associated with sepsis;
(5) transplantation: patients who have under￾gone solid organ transplantation; (6) transplan￾tation with infection; (7) transplantation with sep￾sis; (8) rejection: patients with acute allograft
rejection defined as the requirement for
aggressive antirejection therapy (antithy￾mocyte gammaglobulin or OK-T3) added to
the existing immunosuppressive regimen; or
(9) controls: all critically ill children not meeting
criteria for any one of the above clinical condi￾tions.
One investigator, unaware of serum nitrite
and nitrate concentrations, recorded data pro￾spectively on each patient during each day of
the study period. This investigator examined
patients, reviewed case records, and recorded
the age and diagnoses. The same investigator
classified patients into one of the above
mentioned groups. A second investigator, also
unaware of serum nitrite and nitrate concen￾trations, recorded serum creatinine and biliru￾bin concentrations when available from daily
laboratory test results. A third investigator col￾lected serum from blood samples that re￾mained in the clinical laboratory after routine
daily phlebotomy and stored the samples at
4°C. This investigator was unaware of all
patient information except for patient name
and medical record number. Decisions regard￾ing the need for and frequency of phlebotomy
were made by clinicians not involved in the
study. We have not observed significant
changes in serum nitrite and nitrate levels dur￾ing storage (unpublished data).
SERUM NITRITE AND NITRATE ASSAY
Serum nitrite levels were measured using the
Griess reaction.'4 Serum samples were depro￾teinised using zinc sulphate at 56°C and the
deproteinised samples were diluted 1:1 in
ammonium chloride borate buffer, pH 8.5.
Samples were then pipetted into 96 well
microtitre dishes, and an equal volume of
Griess reagent (1% sulphanilamide, 0.1%
naphthyethylenediamine dihydrochloride,
2.5% orthophosphoric acid) was added to each
well. After incubation for 15 minutes at room
temperature, absorbance was measured at
550 nm using sodium nitrite as a standard.
Nitrate was evaluated in a similar manner,
after first reducing serum nitrate to nitrite by
placing the serum samples into the wells of 96
well Millipore filter plates treated with a slurry
of freshly prepared deoxidised, washed cad￾mium powder in water. Samples were incu￾bated for two hours at room temperature and
then filtered into a plain 96 well plate using a

Millipore suction tray. The cadmium lined
wells were washed once with 50 gl of
ammonium chloride borate buffer, and then an
equal volume of the Griess reagent was added
to each sample and the absorbance read at
550 nm using potassium nitrate as a standard.
Nitrite concentrations were low ( < 10 gM) in
the samples relative to nitrate concentrations.
Therefore, the combined nitrate plus nitrite
concentration ( iM) was used for data analysis.
The results of the assay procedure were
compared to results obtained using high
performance liquid chromatography with a
copper coated cadmium column as previously
published.4 The correlation coefficient for the
two methods was 0.946 with a slope of 0.923.
Each assay also included controls of pooled
normal serum to which 100 jiM or 200 jM
sodium nitrate were added. The pooled normal
serum alone contained 25.9 (SD 2.1) FM
nitrate. Adding 100 jiM resulted in recovery of
139.5 (4.2) jM and adding 200 jiM resulted in
recovery of 226.3 (9.0) jiM.
DATA ANALYSIS AND DESCRIPTION
The degree to which serum nitrite plus nitrate
levels represent exogenously administered NO
was evaluated in two ways: (1) linear regression
analysis was performed using total dosage of
nitroprusside plus glyceryl trinitrate (jg/kg/
min) as the independent variable and the
change in serum nitrite plus nitrate level from
baseline as the dependent variable, and (2) the
maximum serum nitrite plus nitrate concentra￾tions attained by children receiving exogenous
NO were compared to that of the control
group.
The degree to which serum nitrite plus
nitrate concentrations represented increased
endogenous NO production was evaluated by
comparing the maximum level of serum nitrite
plus nitrate reached by children during the
course of (1) infection, (2) sepsis, (3) shock
without sepsis, (4) transplantation, (5) trans￾plantation with infection, (6) transplantation
with sepsis, or (7) transplantation with rejec￾tion, to the maximum level attained by children
in the control group. Because the data were not
normally distributed, the Kruskal-Wallis test
with Dunn' s test for multiple comparisons was
used and a p value < 0.05 was considered sig￾nificant. Distributions of the maximum serum
nitrite plus nitrate levels attained by patients in
the various study groups are further described
in histogram formats.
The value of the serum nitrite and nitrate
concentration as an indicator of disease was
assessed by comparing the levels at the time of
diagnosis among the different groups using the
Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn's test for
multiple comparisons. A p value of < 0.05 was
considered significant. For any group with a
p < 0.05 at the time of diagnosis, the sensitiv￾ity, specificity, positive predictive value, and
negative predictive value of the serum nitrite
plus nitrate level as an indicator of the disease
state was calculated at the threshold levels of 2
to 5 standard deviations (SD) above the
respective mean for the control group.
The degree to which differences in renal or
hepatic metabolism affected serum levels of
nitrite plus nitrate was evaluated as follows.
The effect of renal dysfunction was evaluated
in patients who showed a doubling of serum
creatinine in at least three consecutive serum
samples and who had concomitant measure￾ments of nitrite and nitrate levels. Individual
linear regression analyses were performed
using serum creatinine as the independent
variable and serum levels of nitrite plus nitrate
as the dependent variable. Renal dysfunction
was also analysed by performing linear regres￾sion analysis using first day values of serum
creatinine and concomitant serum concentra￾tions of nitrite plus nitrate for each patient.
The effect of hepatic dysfunction on serum
concentrations of nitrite and nitrate was exam￾ined in patients having at least three serum
bilirubin measurements with concomitant
measurements of nitrite and nitrate and no evi￾dence of haemolysis. For each of these patients,
linear correlation analysis was carried out using
serum bilirubin levels as the independent vari￾able and serum concentrations of nitrite plus
nitrate as the dependent variable.
Examples of individual patients showing
daily changes in clinical status and the
associated changes in total serum nitrite plus
nitrate are given as well.
Results
One hundred and thirty seven consecutive
critically ill children were evaluated. Thirteen
children met criteria for more than one of the
study groups at the time the maximum serum
nitrite and nitrate concentration was attained
and were therefore excluded from analysis.
Therefore 124 children meeting criteria for
only one group at the time of diagnosis and at
the point of maximum serum nitrite plus
nitrate concentration were included in the
analysis. The control group reflected the diver￾sity of the patient population typically seen in
our intensive care unit. Postoperative diagnoses
included intracranial and spinal surgery (n =
13), head and neck surgery (n = 4), and cardiac
surgery (n = 13). Five children with trauma but
no shock were in the control group. Medical
diagnoses included Guillain-Barre syndrome,
cystic fibrosis awaiting lung transplantation,
imipramine ingestion, airway obstruction,
sickle cell disease with chest syndrome, bron￾chopulmonary dysplasia, diabetic ketoacidosis,

(n = 81) attained a maximum concentration
greater than 80 p.M. Children with shock not
associated with sepsis did not attain a maxi￾mum concentration greater than 80 pM. The
maximum serum nitrite plus nitrate concentra￾tions attained in children with transplantation
were widely distributed (fig 3). However, all
three patients with acute rejection attained a
maximum concentration greater than 100 pM.
Among non-transplant patients, only pa￾tients with sepsis syndrome had higher serum
nitrite plus nitrate than controls at the time of
diagnosis. Based on this analysis the sensitivity,
specificity, positive predictive value, and nega￾tive predictive value of serum nitrite plus
nitrate concentrations at the time of diagnosis
of sepsis was evaluated at 2, 3, 4, and 5 SD
above the respective mean for the control
group (table 3). All patients from the control,
infection, sepsis, and sepsis without shock
groups were included in this evaluation. No
patients with transplantation were included.
Notably, a serum level of 35.8 jiM (2 SD above
the control mean) had a negative predictive
value of 99% for sepsis with a sensitivity of
92% and a specificity of 86%. In contrast, a
serum concentration of 63.6 jM (5 SD from
the control mean) had a positive predictive
value of 100% for sepsis with a sensitivity of
50% and a specificity of 100%.

(1 1 %) of these patients had a significant corre￾lation between serum creatinine and serum
nitrite plus nitrate concentrations on these
days (p < 0.05; r' = 0.63 and 0.57, respec￾tively). In 86 patients, first day serum creati￾nine values did not correlate with concomitant
serum nitrite plus nitrate concentrations
(p=0.10; r'=0.032). Eleven patients had at
least three serum bilirubin estimations with
concomitant serum nitrite plus nitrate concen￾trations available for analysis. One (9%) of
these patients had a significant correlation
between these values (p < 0.05, r'=0.79).
Figure 4A shows a patient with increasing
serum nitrite plus nitrate concentrations that
were associated with therapeutic inhalation of
NO. Discontinuation of inhaled NO was asso￾ciated with a decrease in the concentrations
towards baseline. Figure 4B shows a child with
septic shock that was associated with increas￾ing serum nitrite plus nitrate concentrations.
Figure 4C shows a child with acute allograft
rejection who showed an increase in serum
nitrite plus nitrate concentrations during the
episode of rejection. The values decreased after
immunosuppressive treatment with OKT-3.
Figure 4D represents a patient who developed
acute renal failure, sepsis, and rejection at dif￾ferent timepoints. In this patient, serum nitrite
plus nitrate concentrations did not change with
changes in renal function as measured by
serum creatinine. However, changes in serum
nitrite plus nitrate did occur during episodes of
septic shock and acute rejection.

paediatric population. As hypothesised, pa￾tients receiving exogenous sources of NO
(glyceryl trinitrate, nitroprusside, or inhaled
NO) had higher levels than control patients.
The observed correlation between dosage
changes in NO donor medications and serum
nitrite plus nitrate concentrations suggests that
this test may be a useful indirect measure of
NO in children.
As hypothesised, serum nitrite plus nitrate
concentrations were increased in children with
sepsis or transplantation at the time of diagno￾sis. Interestingly, significantly increased values
were not seen in children with infection, or
shock without sepsis, two groups expected to
have increased endogenous NO production
relative to control patients at the time of diag￾nosis. However, over the course of illness both
groups reached a maximum level greater than
that of the control population. Similar results
occurred in the transplant population. At the
time of diagnosis, children with transplantation
having concomitant sepsis or rejection did not
have significantly higher concentrations than
transplant patients without sepsis or rejection.
However, over time the maximum concentra￾tion attained was higher when sepsis or
rejection was present concomitantly. One pos￾sible explanation for these findings is that NO
production may increase at the onset of these
conditions, but increased serum nitrite plus
nitrate levels are not detectable for some period
of time.
The lack of a strong association between
evolving renal or hepatic dysfunction and
serum nitrite plus nitrate concentrations sup￾ports the notion that increased concentrations
during infection, sepsis, shock without sepsis,
transplantation, or rejection are due, at least in
part, to increased endogenous NO production
rather than to decreased metabolism or elimi￾nation of stable end products. This assertion
must be considered carefully because differ￾ences in metabolism could be important in
individual patients.
Endogenous NO production occurs through
the enzyme nitric oxide synthase (NOS), of
which there are three isoforms: endothelial
NOS, neuronal NOS, and inducible NOS
(iNOS).'5 iNOS is expressed after exposure to
endotoxin or cytokines, or both, and is thought
to be responsible for prolonged and high
output of NO seen during proinflammatory
conditions such as the sepsis syndrome.'6 Ani￾mal and human studies have shown that
increased serum nitrite and nitrate concentra￾tions reflect increased endogenous production
of NO during the sepsis syndrome.' 4 Interest￾ingly, iNOS regulation can manifest marked
species variability and specificity, implying that
iNOS regulation in humans may not be
governed by the same proinflammatory media￾tors that lead to iNOS expression in rodents
and other mammalian species."7 Our present
data indicate that increased endogenous pro￾duction of NO occurs not only during the sep￾Nitric oxide

sis syndrome, but also in other clinical
conditions associated with immune activation
such as infection, transplantation, and rejec￾tion. The NOS isoform responsible for this
increased endogenous NO remains to be
definitively established.
Patients with infection tended to have lower
serum levels of nitrite and nitrate than patients
with the sepsis syndrome. We speculate that
some patients with
a focus of infection who go
on to develop the sepsis syndrome may have
a
more extensive elaboration of proinflammatory
mediators and consequently produce greater
amounts of NO (possibly through iNOS) than
patients with infection who do not develop the
sepsis syndrome. If this speculation is correct,
then it would lend further support for the role
of NO as an important effector molecule in the
manifestations of the sepsis syndrome.
The observation that patients with either
transplantation or rejection had increased
serum nitrite plus nitrate concentrations pro￾vides a relevant clinical correlate to rodent
models of transplantation.'8 19 In these models
serum nitrite and nitrate concentrations in￾crease in proportion to the degree of rejection,
suggesting that greater immune stimulation (as
occurs during acute allograft rejection) leads to
greater endogenous NO production.
A similar
phenomenon may have occurred in our pa￾tients, as evidenced by the maximum serum
nitrite plus nitrate values greater than 100 iM
in all three patients with acute rejection but in
only one of seven patients with transplantation
in the absence of acute rejection.
We also observed higher maximum serum
nitrite plus nitrate concentrations in children
who developed shock as
a result of chronic
heart failure, haemorrhage, or cardiorespira￾tory arrest. These conditions are not com￾monly linked to inflammation, and are not
generally thought to be associated with in￾creased iNOS expression. Rather, the endothe￾lial NOS pathways have been hypothesised as
the source of increased NO production. Inter￾estingly, patients with sepsis had higher serum
nitrite plus nitrate concentrations than chil￾dren with shock not associated with sepsis. One
possible explanation for this observation is that
immune activation increases NO production in
children with sepsis in addition to any increase
in NO which might be associated with
hypotension per se. Future studies will be
needed to address this possibility.
The clinical value of serum nitrite and
nitrate concentrations as
a tool for diagnosis or
therapeutic monitoring of sepsis or allograft
rejection requires further study. The obs￾ervation that serum nitrite plus nitrate concen￾trations above 80 jM were attained only by
children with sepsis, transplantation, or organ
rejection suggests that
a threshold serum
nitrite plus nitrate concentration may be used
as an indicator of immune stimulation and
increased endogenous NO production. The
observation that individual patients had in￾creased levels above 80 jM when rejection or
sepsis occurred, and returned to lower levels
when sepsis or rejection resolved, suggests that
absolute changes in serum nitrite and nitrate
concentrations could be indicative of these
disease states. In some children, it may be pos￾sible to follow concentrations as a measure of
therapeutic efficacy. However, the observation
that some children with sepsis never attain
concentrations greater than those in control
patients suggests that this test alone will not be
diagnostic in all children with sepsis. Also the
observation that the level at presentation with
sepsis can be lower than the maximum value
attained over time suggests that the diagnostic
value of the test will depend on the time when
the assay is performed. Similarly, the overlap
between the maximum serum nitrite plus
nitrate concentrations attained by transplanta￾tion patients, with and without acute allograft
rejection, suggests that this test will be unable
to differentiate all acute rejection events. At
present no laboratory test other than biopsy
has been shown to possess this degree of
discrimination. Future investigation is war￾ranted to determine whether serum nitrite and
nitrate concentrations can add any further pre￾dictive power to tests currently used to evaluate
children at risk for sepsis or rejection.
Limitations of this study should be consid￾ered. Definitions of sepsis and rejection may be
subject to interpretation. For example, we did
not subcategorise children with the systemic
inflammatory response syndrome.20 Some pa￾tients in the infection group may have been
classified as having the systemic inflammatory
response syndrome, rather than infection, by
other investigators. Also, we did not require
biopsy verification of acute rejection. Some
patients with transplantation may have had
varying degrees of acute rejection, but accord￾ing to our definitions were placed in the trans￾plantation group rather than the rejection
group. Third, increased levels in patients with
acute rejection may have occurred secondary
to immunotherapy rather than the rejection
process alone.
In summary, we suggest that endogenous
NO production can be evaluated in critically ill
children using
a method for measurement of
nitrite and nitrate which allows for rapid
processing of samples in the clinical laboratory
setting. It is important to note that measure￾ment of nitrite levels alone would not have
been sufficient to carry out this study; it was
necessary to develop
a technique that allows
for concomitant measurement of nitrate as
well. The pending development of pharmaco￾logical strategies directed towards the selective
inhibition of iNOS underlines the relevance of
these data. We conclude that endogenous NO
production, as measured by serum nitrite and
nitrate levels, is increased in clinical conditions
characterised by immune stimulation: infec￾tion, sepsis, transplantation, and rejection, and
in
a clinical condition not commonly associ￾ated with immune activation-shock without
sepsis. Our data provide
a foundation for
future studies concerning the role and sources
of endogenous NO production in pediatric
critical illness. The value of serum nitrite and
nitrate concentrations as
a useful diagnostic
tool or therapeutic monitor in the clinical
evaluation of children at risk for developing the
