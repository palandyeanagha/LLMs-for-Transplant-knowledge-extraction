C3 glomerulopathy (C3G) results from acquired or genetic abnormalities in the
complement alternative pathway (AP). C3G with monoclonal immunoglobulin (MIg-C3G)
was recently included in the spectrum of “monoclonal gammopathy of renal significance.”
However, mechanisms of complement dysregulation in MIg-C3G are not described and
the pathogenic effect of the monoclonal immunoglobulin is not understood. The purpose
of this study was to investigate the mechanisms of complement dysregulation in a cohort
of 41 patients with MIg-C3G. Low C3 level and elevated sC5b-9, both biomarkers of C3
and C5 convertase activation, were present in 44 and 78% of patients, respectively.
Rare pathogenic variants were identified in 2/28 (7%) tested patients suggesting that
the disease is acquired in a large majority of patients. Anti-complement auto-antibodies
were found in 20/41 (49%) patients, including anti-FH (17%), anti-CR1 (27%), anti-FI
(5%) auto-antibodies, and C3 Nephritic Factor (7%) and were polyclonal in 77% of
patients. Using cofactor assay, the regulation of the AP was altered in presence of
purified IgG from 3/9 and 4/7 patients with anti-FH or anti-CR1 antibodies respectively.
By using fluid and solid phase AP activation, we showed that total purified IgG of
22/34 (65%) MIg-C3G patients were able to enhance C3 convertase activity. In five
documented cases, we showed that the C3 convertase enhancement was mostly
due to the monoclonal immunoglobulin, thus paving the way for a new mechanism of

complement dysregulation in C3G. All together the results highlight the contribution of
both polyclonal and monoclonal Ig in MIg-C3G. They provide direct insights to treatment
approaches and opened up a potential way to a personalized therapeutic strategy based
on chemotherapy adapted to the B cell clone or immunosuppressive therapy.

INTRODUCTION
C3 glomerulopathy (C3G) is a heterogeneous group of rare
glomerular diseases, characterized by predominant C3 deposition
in glomeruli (1–3) and resulting from dysregulation of the
complement alternative pathway (AP) (4–6). In physiological
conditions, the complement AP is continuously activated at a
low level and is amplified on activating surfaces, such as bacteria
or dying cells (7). To avoid undesirable auto-amplification, the
AP is tightly regulated in the fluid-phase and on cell surfaces
by the plasma regulatory proteins factor H (FH), factor I
(FI), membrane cofactor protein (MCP, CD46), complement
receptor 1 (CR1, CD35), and decay accelerating factor (DAF,
CD55) (8). Together, these regulators act by preventing the
formation of and by dissociating the AP C3 convertase (FH,
CR1, and DAF) and by serving as cofactors for FI-mediated
inactivation of C3b to iC3b (FH, MCP, and CR1). Properdin
is the only positive regulator of the AP, stabilizing the AP
C3/C5 convertase (8, 9). Many of these factors are involved in
complement dysregulation in C3G. Rare pathogenic variants in
AP genes are identified in ∼25% of C3G patients (5, 6, 10).
In most cases, complement dysregulation is acquired, induced
by the presence of Nephritic Factors (C3NeF and C5NeF), i.e.,
autoantibodies targeting the AP C3/C5 convertase (6, 10) or
anti-FH antibodies (11, 12). Recently, C3G has been proposed
to be included in the spectrum of monoclonal gammopathy of
renal significance (MGRS) because of the high prevalence of
monoclonal immunoglobulins (MIg) in C3G patients aged over
50, without criteria for multiple myeloma, that reached 30–71%
in two small series, and 65% in the French C3G cohorts (13–
16). Although this association and the favorable effect of clone￾targeted therapy on renal outcomes (16) suggests a role of MIg in
the occurrence of the renal disease, the exact pathophysiological
link between MIg and AP dysregulation remains to be
elucidated.
The aim of the current work was to determine the mechanism
of acquired complement AP dysregulation in patients with
MIg-C3G in order to clarify the causal relationship between the
MIg and the occurrence of C3G.
METHODS
Study Population
Between 2000 and June 2014, 201 plasma samples from
patients aged over 18 were received at the Laboratory of
Immunology (European Hospital Georges Pompidou) for
complement exploration in the context of C3G. The diagnosis
of C3G was assessed by immunofluorescence according to
consensus recommendations, with bright diffuse predominant
C3 glomerular staining (≥2+), of at least two orders of
magnitude greater than any other immune reactant (i.e., Ig).
Patients with trace or weak amounts of IgM staining on
glomerular sclerotic lesions were included, but those with weak
staining for IgG, IgA or Ig light chains were excluded (2).
The diagnosis of DDD was confirmed by demonstration of
diffuse, highly electron-dense osmiophilic deposits within the
lamina densa by EM. By contrast, the diagnosis of C3GN was
established in patients showing deposits of lesser density without
the characteristic distribution and “sausage shape” appearance of
DDD (1). All patients with positive hepatitis B or C serology,
antinuclear antigen autoantibodies, anti- double-stranded DNA
antibodies, or cryoglobulinemia are excluded from the French
C3G registry.
Search for monoclonal gammopathy was performed by
immunofixation in all patients aged over 40. Of the 201 adult
patients in the French registry of C3G, 60 patients (G1-G60)
had a detectable MIg. Among them, 50 were included in a
retrospective clinical study regarding the effect of chemotherapy
on renal outcomes (16). In the current study, 41/60 MIg￾C3G patients with available blood samples were included
(Supplemental Figure 1). Two of 28 patients screened for genetic
abnormalities carried a rare variant of undetermined significance
(p.Asp130Asn in CFH and p.Glu548Gln in CFI), as previously
described (16). As 96% of MIg-C3G patients displayed a C3GN
pattern on kidney biopsy, 107 adult patients with C3GN without
MIg extracted from the French cohort of C3G, and 8 patients with
MIg without kidney disease, were used as control population.
The local ethics committee approved the study and the study was
approved by the Commission Nationale de L’informatique et des
Libertés (CCP number 192 12 23) and all legal representative
of children gave written informed consent for genetic
analysis.
Assays for Complement Component and
for C3 and C5 Nephritic Factors
EDTA plasma samples were obtained from all patients.
Plasma protein concentrations of C3, C4 were measured by
nephelometry (Dade Behring, Deerfield, IL, USA). Soluble C5b￾9 level determination was done using the MicroVue sC5b￾9 Plus EIA Assay (Quidel, San Diego, CA), according to
manufacturer instructions. Normal values were established from
plasma samples from 100 healthy donors. C3NeF and C5NeF
activities were determined by assessing the ability of purified
plasma IgG to stabilize the membrane-bound C3bBb and
C3bBbP convertases (6).

Chauvet et al. C3 Glomerulopathy and Monoclonal Gammopathy
ELISA Detection for anti-FH, anti-FI,
anti-CR1, anti-C3b and anti-FB Antibodies
ELISA plates were coated with 10 to 15µg/ml of FH (11), FI,
FB, C3b (17) (all from Complement Technologies, Tylor, Texas),
CR1 (RandD System) in PBS for 1 h, followed by blocking of
the plates with PBS-0.4% Tween 20. Plasma was diluted 1/200
in PBS-0.1% Tween 20 and applied for 1 h. Bound IgG or IgA
was revealed by anti-human IgG antibody conjugated with HRP
(Southern Biotech) or anti-human IgA antibody conjugated with
HRP (Sigma) diluted in PBS-0.1% Tween 20, followed by TMB
substrate system.
Study of IgG Binding to CR1 by Surface
Plasmon Resonance (SPR)
The interaction of patient IgG with CR1 was analyzed in
real time using a ProteOn XPR36 SPR equipment (BioRad,
Marne-la-coquette, France). CR1 (RandD System) was covalently
immobilized to a GLC sensor chip (BioRad) following the
manufacturer’s procedure. Protein G purified IgG from the
patients or healthy donors (at 100µg/ml) were injected for
300 s in PBS 0.005% Tween 20 containing running buffer.
The dissociation was followed for 300 s. The signal from the
interspots, reflecting the background binding was subtracted, as
recommended by the manufacturer.
Study of C3b Interaction With CR1 in
Presence of Patients IgG by Surface
Plasmon Resonance
IgG from patients with anti-CR1 antibodies were tested for
their capacity to alter the C3b binding to CR1 using SPR. CR1
was coupled to individual flow channels of GLC biosensor chip
using standard amine-coupling, according to the manufacturer’s
instruction. Total purified IgG were flowed at a concentration 100
mg/ml followed by injection of C3b (Complement Technologies)
at concentrations starting from 1µg/ml. Five concentrations
and a running buffer were injected at 30 µl/min in HEPES
buffer (10 mM Hepes, 25 mM NaCl, Tween 0.005%, pH 7.4)
for 300 s across the immobilized ligand. Data were analyzed
using ProteOn Manager software and the data from the blank
channel were subtracted. Kinetic parameters were calculated by
fitting the obtained sensorgrams into a two-state interaction
model.
Determination of Light Chain and Heavy
Chain Isotype Specificity of
Anti-complement Protein Antibodies
The light chain (LC) isotype of antibodies was determined by
ELISA. After plasma incubation and washing, isotype-specific
goat antibodies directed against kappa and lambda LC (Southern
Biotech), diluted in PBS-0.1% Tween 20 were incubated 1 h.
Bound Ig was revealed by a Rabbit anti goat IgG Ab (Santa
Cruz) diluted in PBS-0.1% Tween 20, followed by TMB substrate
system. The ratios of the optical densities obtained with the anti￾k and anti-l Abs (k/l) were calculated for all samples. A k/l ratio
< 0.1 or >3 indicated the predominance of anti-complement
autoantibody of lambda or kappa LC specificity respectively, as
previously described. A ratio between 0.1 and 3 indicated both
kappa and lambda reactivity (11). The heavy chain (HC) IgG
subtypes of anti FH and anti CR1 IgG Ab were determined by
an anti-FH or anti-CR1 ELISA. After plasma incubation and
washing, isotype-specific mouse antibodies directed against IgG1,
IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4 (NL16 for IgG1, GOM2 for IgG2, ZG4 for
IgG3, and RJ4 or IgG4) (Unipath, Bedford, UK), diluted PBS￾0.1% Tween 20 were incubated 1 h. Bound IgG was revealed
by a rabbit anti mouse IgG Ab (Jackson ImmunoResearch)
diluted in PBS-0.1% Tween 20, followed by TMB substrate
system.
Determination of LC and HC Isotype
Specificity of Monoclonal Immunoglobulin
The analysis of serum MIg of 29/41 patients was performed by a
western blotting. Serum dilutions were adjusted to normalized
gamma globulin levels. Proteins were separated by high￾resolution thin layer agarose electrophoresis and transferred
on nitrocellulose sheets. After saturation with skimmed milk,
the blots were probed with polyclonal antibodies specific for
a, g, m, k or l Ig chains or with monoclonal antibodies
specific for IgG subclasses with NL16 for IgG1, GOM2 for
IgG2, ZG4 for IgG3, and RJ4 or IgG4 (Unipath, Bedford, UK),
followed by peroxydase coupled rabbit anti mouse IgG antibodies
(Jackson ImmunoResearch). The signal was developed by chemo
luminescence using ECL kit (Perkin Elmer) and MyECL Imager
(Thermo Scientific).
IgG Purification
Total IgG Purification
IgG were purified from plasma of MIg-C3G patients or from
plasma of control patients (healthy donors, patients with positive
C3NeF and patients with MIg but without kidney disease) by
using Protein G beads (GE Healthcare), as recommended by the
manufacturer. The concentration of the IgG was determined by a
Nanodrop spectrophotometer.
Purification of Monoclonal And Polyclonal Igs by
Chromatography
Monoclonal and polyclonal Ig fractions of 5 patients (with
monoclonal IgG) were purified using ion exchange column
chromatography. Each plasma sample was dialyzed against
10 mM Tris (pH8). Prepaked diethyl-aminoethyl (DEAE)
trisacryl column (Life Science) was equilibrated with 10 mM
Tris (pH8). The dialyzed samples were loaded onto the column
followed by elution with a 0–0.2 M NaCl gradient in 10 mM
Tris buffer (pH8). Serial 1 ml fractions were collected and
assayed for protein concentration (280 nm OD). The fractions
were tested by agarose electrophoresis and immunofixation
to determine which fractions contained polyclonal
or MIg.
Cofactor Assays
C3 protein (20µg/ml; Calbiochem) was incubated at 37◦C for 0,
1, 5, or 10 min with FI (10µg/ml; Complement Technologies)
and FH (20µg/ml; Complement Technologies, Tylor, Texas),
or soluble CR1 (10µg/ml; RandD Systems) in 10 mM Tris,

probed by a Western blot, using SNAP system (Millipore).
After blocking with Tris 10 mM, NaCl 150 mM, 0.1% Tween,
1% BSA, the blots were probed with a 1:5,000 dilution of goat
anti-human C3 IgG (Calbiochem) followed by HRP-conjugated
rabbit anti-goat IgG (Santa Cruz). The signal was developed by
chemiluminescence using ECL kit (Perkin Elmer) and MyECL
Imager (Thermo Scientific). Cleavage efficiency was evaluated

of the α-chain at 10 min and quantitated by densitometry of
the scanned images. The ratio between α43 and the β bands
(representing the % of C3b cleaved) was plotted vs. the time of

C3 Convertase Formation in Normal
Human Serum in Presence of Patients’ IgG
Purified total IgG from patients or healthy donors were
incubated for 30 min at 37◦C with normal human serum diluted
1:3 in presence of EGTA-Mg to block the classical pathway
(10 mM MgCl2,10 mM EGTA, 40 mM NaCl Hepes buffer). The
generation of C3a was quantified by the Micro Vue C3a Kit
(Quidel) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. IgG from
8 patients with MIg without kidney disease were used as
controls.
Fluid Phase C3 Convertase Activation in
Presence of Patients’ IgG
Total purified IgG (100µg/ml) were incubated for 45 min at 37◦C
with C3 (25µg/ml), FB (0 to 50 ng), FD (0.05µg/ml) (all from
Complement Technologies, Tylor, Texas) in Hepes, 40 mM NaCl
supplemented with 10 mM MgCl2. The reaction was stopped
by adding DTT-containing sample buffer. The cleavage of C3
was probed by a Western blot, using SNAP system (Millipore).
After blocking with Tris 10 mM, NaCl 150 mM, 0.1% Tween,
1% BSA, blots were probed with a 1:5,000 dilution of goat

RESULTS
MIg-C3G Is Associated With Biomarkers of
C3/C5 Convertase Activation
Forty-one patients from the French registry of C3G met inclusion
criteria (Supplemental Figure 1). Baseline clinical data and
complement biomarkers are detailed in Supplemental Table 1
and Table 1. At diagnosis, 18/41 (44%) MIg-C3G patients had a
low C3 level and a normal C4 (Table 1). Median C3 level of MIg￾C3G patients and C3GN patients without MIg were similar (p =
0.86) (Figure 1A). Soluble C5b-9 was increased in 29/37 (78%)
MIg-C3G patients and in 47/76 (62%) C3GN patients without
MIg (p = 0.09) (Table 1). Median sC5b-9 level was significantly
higher in MIg-C3G patients compared to patients without MIg
(p = 0.005) (Figure 1B).
Detection of Anti-complement Protein
Auto-antibodies in MIg-C3G
Samples were screened for C3 NeF/C5 NeF and auto-antibodies
targeting 5 proteins of the AP (Figures 2A-F). Anti-FH auto￾antibodies, C3NeF and anti-FI auto-antibodies were detected
in 17% (9/41), 7% (3/41), and 5% (2/41) of MIg-C3G patients,
respectively. None had anti-C3b, anti-FB antibodies or C5NeF.
Eleven patients were positive for anti-CR1 auto-antibodies
(11/41, 27%) (Figure 2E and Supplemental Figure 2A). The
characteristics of the binding of anti-CR1 positive IgG to
CR1 by Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) are provided

auto-antibodies were detected in 20/41 (49%) MIg-C3G
patients, including 4 patients with combined anti-FH
and anti-CR1 antibodies and 1 with anti-FI and anti-FH
antibodies.
C3 and sC5b9 levels were similar in patients with or without
antibodies (Figures 3A,B). Compared to C3GN patients without
MIg, MIg-C3G patients had significantly lower frequency of
C3NeF [3/41(7%) vs. 44/98(45%); p = 0.0001] and C5NeF
(p = 0.002), higher frequency of anti-CR1 auto-antibodies
[11/41(27%) vs. 3/84(4%); p = 0.0001] and similar frequency of
anti-FH auto-antibodies (Table 1).
Functional studies were carried out in patients with anti￾FH, anti-CR1 and anti-FI antibodies. We studied the impact of
anti-FH antibodies on AP regulation by studying the capacity
of FI to cleave C3b in iC3b in presence of FH. We performed
a fluid phase cofactor assay in presence of total IgG purified
from patients with anti-FH antibodies or healthy donors (HD).
The C3b cleavage was revealed by Western Blot and ratio α43-
chain on β-chain of C3b, determined by densitometry, was
used to determine the % of C3b cleavage. C3b cleavage was
significantly decreased in 3/9 patients with anti-FH antibodies
(Figures 3C,D).
We next studied the functional properties of anti￾CR1 antibodies. The presence of anti-CR1 antibodies
resulted in decreased capacity (from 12 to 25%) of C3b
to bind CR1, as demonstrated by SPR-based technology
(Supplemental Figures 2D–F). Moreover, by Western blot,
significant reduced CR1 cofactor activity for FI was obtained
in presence of IgG purified from 4/7 anti-CR1 positive patients
(Figures 3E,F). In 2 patients with anti-FI antibodies, C3b
cleavage by FI in presence of FH was not decreased (data not
shown).
Study of Light and Heavy Chain Isotype
Specificity of Anti-complement Protein
Antibodies
MIg heavy chain (HC) and light chain (LC) isotype
specificities were determined by immunoblot in 29 patients
(Supplemental Table 2).
Using ELISA, we determined heavy chain (HC) and light
chain (LC) isotype specificity of anti-complement antibodies in
13 positive patients. In 3 cases, anti-FI IgA, anti-FH IgG or anti￾FH IgA antibodies displayed similar HC and LC restriction as
the MIg. In 10/13 (77%) positive patients, the MIg HC (all of
IgG isotype) and/or LC did not match those of the respective
auto-antibodies (Table 2).
Patients’ Ig Induce Fluid-Phase and
Solid-Phase AP Convertase Activation
To test the capacity of total purified IgG (containing the MIg)
of MIg-C3G patients to activate complement AP, we measured
C3a release in normal human serum (NHS) by ELISA after
incubation with patients’ IgG or IgG from healthy donors
(Supplemental Figure 3). For 10/32 patients’ IgG, C3a level was
above the mean+2SD cut-off obtained with IgG from healthy
donors (Supplemental Figure 3A). C3a release was similar in
MIg-C3G patients with or without anti-complement protein
auto-antibodies (Supplemental Figure 3B).
To demonstrate that IgG of MIg-C3G patients directly
enhance the C3 cleavage into C3b without the influence of
auto-antibodies, purified C3, FB, FD were incubated with total
IgG from controls (Healthy-donors (HD) and patients with
MIg without kidney disease) and MIg-C3G patients and tested
in solution or on IgG-coated plate in presence of EGTA￾Mg2+. The % of C3 cleavage into C3b was determined by
Western blot, by measuring the ratio between α
′
chain and
βchain of C3b, determined by densitometry. Mean % of C3
cleavage was 38% in the presence of IgG from HDs in solution
(mean + 2DS of the ratio = 56%) and 39% on HD-IgG￾coated plate (mean + 2DS of the ratio = 59%). Cleavage of
C3 was increased (higher than mean+2SD) in presence of
12/34 MIg-C3G patients’ IgG in solution (Figures 4A,B) and
on 13/34 IgG-coated plates (Figures 4C,D). Total IgG purified
from 3 patients increased C3b formation both in solution and
on coated IgG. Patients’ IgG that activated the C3 convertase
in solution or on coated phase were named “C3-activating
IgG.” Altogether 22/34 tested patients’ IgG displayed capacity
to cleave C3. In both experimental conditions, C3b formation
was significantly higher compared to that obtained in presence
of total IgG from patients with MIg but without kidney
disease (Figures 4B,D). C3 cleavage was similar in MIg-C3G
patients with or without anti-complement protein antibodies
(Supplemental Figures 3C,D).
C3 levels were significantly lower in patients positive for C3-
activating IgG than in those negative (P = 0.03) (Figure 4E),
whereas there was no difference for sC5b9 in plasma (p = 0.94)
(Figure 4F). Plasma sC5b9 levels were upper than twice the
normal value in 12/22 (57%) patients with C3-activating IgG and
in 3/14 (21%) patients without this capacity (p = 0.04).

increased compared to patients without “C3-activating” IgG. (F) sC5b9 level of patients with “C3-activating” IgG was similar to patients without “C3-activating” IgG.
Monoclonal Ig Are Able to Enhance Fluid
Phase C3 Convertase Overactivation
To identify the components involved in the AP activation, the
MIg was separated from polyclonal Ig by chromatography in
2 patients with C3-activating IgG (G12, G20) and 3 patients
without C3 activating IgG in fluid phase (G38, G40, G24).
In samples from patients G12 and G20, C3b formation was
increased in presence of the MIg compared to the polyclonal Ig
(Figures 5A,B).
We also investigated whether the capacity of total IgG
to activate the AP disappeared after complete hematological
response (as assessed by negative serum immunofixation)
following chemotherapy. Blood samples from 3 patients (G5,
G37, G53) in whom total IgG were responsible for C3 cleavage
in solution were available. In all three cases, C3 cleavage was
significantly reduced in presence of total IgG purified from blood
after treatment compared to that obtained with IgG from the
same patients at diagnosis (Figures 5C–E).
DISCUSSION
We described for the first time the mechanisms of complement
alternative pathway dysregulation in a peculiar group of
patients with C3G associated with monoclonal immunoglobulin
(MIg-C3G). We found anti complement antibodies in more
than 50% of patients but with different target compare to
C3G patients without monoclonal gammopathy suggesting
that the two diseases are distinct. Moreover, our results

highlight a contribution of both monoclonal and polyclonal
Ig in the inappropriate activation of complement AP in
MIg-C3G patients, paving the way to new therapeutic
strategies.
In the French cohort of adult C3G without detectable MIg,
impaired complement control is driven by C3NeF and by genetic
variation in complement genes in 45 and 27%, respectively.
Genetic abnormalities were identified in only 7% of tested MIg￾C3G patients, suggesting that genetic factors do not play a
major role in MIg-C3G. This result is in agreement with those
of a recent study in which none of 21 tested patients had
any genetic abnormalities (18). Exhaustive screening identified
auto-antibodies targeting complement proteins in about 50%
of MIg-C3G patients. However, the targets of anti-complement
auto-antibodies were different between C3G patients with and
without MIg. Indeed, C3NeF was found in only 7% of MIg￾C3G patients. This is in agreement with previous small cohort
studies, which identified C3NeF in 0/6 and 2/9 MIg-C3G patients
(14, 15). The presence of C5NeF stabilizing the C5 convertase
has been recently described in 56% of patients with C3GN (6).
Interestingly, despite elevated sC5b-9 level in 80% of MIg-C3G
cases, C5NeF was negative in all tested patients. The frequency
of anti-FH auto-antibodies was low and similar to C3G patients
without MIg (11, 12). In contrast, we found that 27% of MIg￾C3G patients had anti-CR1 auto-antibodies, undetectable in C3G
patients without MIg. Interestingly, CR1 which is expressed by
podocytes, emerges as a novel disease-relevant target in C3G (19)
and auto-antibodies targeting CR1 have been found in patients
with multiple myeloma (20). We further explored functional
consequences of these antibodies. Cofactor activity of both CR1
and FH was decreased in 4/7 and 3/9 patients positive for
anti-FH or anti-CR1 antibodies, respectively, whereas it was
normal in two patients with anti-FI antibodies suggesting that
these antibodies have limited functional consequences on AP
regulation. C3 and sC5B9 levels were similar in patients with
or without anti-complement protein antibodies, confirming the
weak contribution of these antibodies in AP dysregulation in
MIg-C3G.
The initial assumption was that autoantibodies targeting
complement proteins were monoclonal. Indeed, in 1999,
Jokiranta et al. demonstrated that a dimeric monoclonal
lambda LC, identified in a patient with glomerulonephritis
and predominant C3 deposits, was able to bind FH as an
auto-antibody, resulting in uncontrolled AP activation in vitro
(21). In the current study, we showed a concordance in the
heavy and light chain isotypes of MIg and anti-complement
protein auto-antibodies in only 3/13 patients. Therefore, our
results suggest that in most cases anti-complement protein
reactivity is not borne by the MIg. This result is in agreement
with other kidney diseases mediated by auto-antibodies,
where the implication of monoclonal autoantibodies remains
exceptional (22, 23).
Further, we tested a new hypothesis according to which the
MIg could serve directly as a complement-activating surface.
We designed an experiment to study C3 cleavage without
interference with the regulatory proteins and thus without the
contribution of anti-complement protein antibodies. In 22/34
(65%) of cases, patients’ IgG enhanced C3 cleavage, and therefore

they could be considered as C3-activating IgG. Interestingly, C3
level was significantly lower in patients with C3-activating IgG
than in those without. Moreover, the percentage of patients with
sC5b9 levels higher than twice the normal value was significantly
increased in patients with C3-activating IgG compared to those
patients without C3-activating IgG. Interestingly, the capacity of
patients’ IgG to enhance C3 cleavage was not increase in patients
with MIg but without kidney disease and the link between an
ongoing complement activation in MIg-C3G patients and the
MIg remains speculative. The direct role of the MIg in AP
activation was strongly suggested in 5 patients. Indeed, in 3
of them, we demonstrated the disappearance of the capacity
of total IgG to activate the C3 convertase once the MIg had
become undetectable after chemotherapy. In 2 patients, we
showed the increased capacity of the MIg to enhance fluid
phase C3 convertase activity compared to the polyclonal IgG
from the same patients. It is well established that MIg have
peculiar physicochemical properties due to different profiles of
glycosylation or mutations/deletions of the variable or constant
domain (24). These peculiarities are likely to account for the
variable capacity of these MIg to enhance C3 convertase in vitro.
It is tempting to speculate that the nascent C3b, generated by slow
fluid phase activation of C3, binds to MIg and forms a starting
point for the subsequent assembly of C3 convertase.
In a recent clinical study, we demonstrated that achievement
of rapid and deep hematological response with clone-targeted
chemotherapy significantly improved renal survival in MIg￾C3G patients and that C3 levels in patients with hematological
response were significantly higher compared with pretreatment
C3 levels (16). The present provides more support for a link
between the monoclonal Ig and renal disease. Therefore targeting
the responsible clone should be a therapeutic goal to preserve or
improve renal function in these patients.
Our study has some limitations. It is a retrospective study
with a relatively low number of patients. Most patients had low
amounts of MIg making the MIg purification process difficult
or even impossible. These limitations did not allow us to
investigate the direct contribution of MIg in AP dysregulation
in all patients, and further studies are needed to depict the full
pathophysiological spectrum of MIg in C3GP.
In conclusion, our study highlight different complement AP
activation mechanisms in C3G associated with MIg compared to
C3G without MIg. We demonstrated that IgG isolated from MIg￾C3G patients directly activate the AP in 65% of cases and our
findings provide further evidence that monoclonal gammopathy
is a cause of the disease, particularly in patients with very high
levels of sC5b9 at diagnosis. Our results highlight the need to
consider chemotherapy targeting the B cell clone in the treatment
strategy of MIg-C3G patients.
