Abstract
Background: Currently, complete surgical resection represents the only potentially curative treatment option for
Biliary Tract Cancer (BTC) including Gallbladder Cancer (GBC). Even after curative resection, 5-year OS is only 20–
40%. Gallbladder carcinoma is relatively rare, but still the fifth most common neoplasm of the digestive tract and
even the most frequent cancer of the biliary system. Gallbladder carcinoma is suspected preoperatively in only 30%
of all pts., while the majority of cases are discovered incidentally by the pathologist after cholecystectomy for a
benign indication. For improving curative rates in BTC and GBC, early systemic therapy combined with radical
resection seems to be a promising approach. The earliest moment to apply chemotherapy would be in front of
radical surgery. The encouraging results of neoadjuvant/perioperative concepts in other malignancies provide an
additional rationale to use this treatment in the early phase of GBC management and even ICC/ECC. Especially
because data regarding pure adjuvant chemotherapy in BTC’s are conflicting.

Methods: This is a multicenter, randomized, controlled, open-label phase III study including pts. with incidentally
discovered GBCs after simple cholecystectomy in front of radical liver resection and pts. with resectable/ borderline
resectable cholangiocarcinomas (ICC/ ECC) scheduled to receive perioperative chemotherapy (Gemcitabine +
Cisplatin 3 cycles pre- and post-surgery) or surgery alone followed by a therapy of investigator’s choice. Primary
endpoint is OS; secondary endpoints are PFS, R0-resection rate, toxicity, perioperative morbidity, mortality and QoL.
A total of N = 333 patients with GBC or BTC will be included. Recruitment has started in August 2019.
Discussion: The current proposed phase III GAIN study investigates whether induction chemotherapy followed by
radical resection in ICC/ECC and re-resection in IGBC (and – if possible – postoperative chemotherapy) prolongs
overall survival compared to radical surgery alone for incidental gallbladder carcinoma and primary resectable or
borderline resectable cholangiocarcinoma. Utilizing a neoadjuvant approach including a second radical surgery will
help to raise awareness for the necessity of radical surgery, especially second radical completion surgery in IGBC
and improve the adherence to the guidelines.

Background
Biliary tract cancer is a rare malignancy arising from epi￾thelial cells of the biliary tree. Cholangiocarcinoma
(CCA) is associated with poor prognosis and standard
therapeutic options are limited. The global incidence
varies according to geographical region with a signifi￾cantly higher burden in South-East Asia compared to
the western world [1]. Here, the rate of intrahepatic
cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) is low with 0.4 to 1.0 cases
per 100,000. The highest incidence is observed in pa￾tients older than 65 years of age. Incidence and mortality
rates are increasing within the last decades in developed
countries. In contrast, hilar and distal CCA demonstrate
only minor regional variations with incidence rates be￾tween 0.5 and 1.1 per 100,000. A minimal male predom￾inance is found in biliary tract cancer patients. Cirrhosis
of the liver, infection with hepatitis B and C and primary
sclerosing cholangitis are known risk factors [2–5]. The
incidence of gallbladder carcinoma (GBCA) is around
2.0 per 100,000 with a median age of 67 years at the time
of diagnosis. Gallstones and chronic infections of the
gallbladder are the most important risk factors for devel￾oping GBCA [6–9].
Gallbladder carcinoma is relatively rare, but still the
fifth most common neoplasm of the digestive tract and
even the most frequent cancer of the biliary system [10].
Gallbladder carcinoma is suspected preoperatively in
only 30% of all patients [11, 12], while the majority of
cases are discovered incidentally by the pathologist
(IGBC) after cholecystectomy for a benign indication.
Reported cases of IGBC in Germany are registered in
the “German Registry of Incidental Gallbladder Carcin￾oma” (GR), the largest casebook of gallbladder carcin￾omas in Europe [11–21]. The GR shows that surgical
treatment of gallbladder carcinoma patients remains not
adequate despite widely published guidelines [13]. Less
than 50% of the patients received stage adjusted surgical
therapy according to the GR data [22]. Stage adjusted
therapy according to the NCCN-, ESMO- and German
S3- Guidelines contains liver resection combined with
dissection of the regional lymph nodes along the hepato￾duodenal ligament in cases of T1b, or more advanced
carcinomas [23, 24]. Gallbladder neoplasms shows a high
incidence of locoregional failure after surgical resection,
with early spread to celiac, retropancreatic, and aortoca￾val nodes as well occult liver spread [25] in formally R0
patients after simple cholecystectomy (SC). The rate of
positive lymphatic nodes is 31.2% in T2- and 45.5% in
T3-stage carcinomas [25, 26]. Lymphatic spread beyond
the hepatoduodenal ligament generally represents dis￾tant metastatic disease, and a cure of such patients by a
pure surgical concept does not seem to be achievable.
Therefore, there is a need for a systemic therapy as
early as possible in the course of treatment in BTC
(ICC/ECC) and also in IGBC’s.
The landmark trial, UK ABC-02 by Valle et al. [27]
compared gemcitabine/cisplatin with gemcitabine alone
in locally advanced or metastatic cholangio- and gall￾bladder carcinomas and showed clear superiority of the
combination, with significant improvements for PFS (8
vs. 5 months, p < 0.001) and OS (8.1 vs. 11.7 months, P <
0.001). Basically, the study indicates the sensitivity of this
disease towards chemotherapy and provides a rationale
for the use of this chemotherapeutic doublet in the
present study.
For improving disease control and cure rates in BTC
(ICC/ ECC) and of IRR in T2–3 IGBC’s, it is meaningful
to implement early additional systemic therapy. The
earliest moment to apply chemotherapy would be dir￾ectly after simple cholecystectomy in IGBC’s and right
Goetze et al. BMC Cancer (2020) 20:122 Page 2 of 8

before surgery in ICC/ECC. The encouraging results of
neoadjuvant/perioperative concepts in esophagogastric,
stomach, rectal, and other malignancies provide an add￾itional rationale to use this treatment in the early phase
of IGBC management and even ICC/ECC. However, due
to the fact that 2/3 of gallbladder carcinomas are inci￾dental findings after simple cholecystectomy, an earlier
start of a systemic therapy in IGBC will be not realizable.
Furthermore, preoperatively discovered gallbladder car￾cinomas are usually too advanced for neoadjuvant/peri￾operative concepts.
Methods/design
Protocol overview
GAIN is a multicenter, randomized, controlled, open-label
phase III study including patients with pT2–3 N- or pT1-3
N+ incidentally discovered gallbladder carcinomas (IGBC/
70% of all GBC’s) after simple cholecystectomy and patients
with resectable/ borderline resectable cholangiocarcinomas
(ICC/ ECC) scheduled to receive perioperative chemother￾apy or surgery alone. Study sponsor following German
Pharmaceuticals Act is the Krankenhaus Nordwest gGmbH
(Frankfurt), lead coordinating investigator is PD Dr.
Thorsten O. Goetze.
Potential study participants will be assessed for eligibil￾ity during a 28-day screening period. Eligible patients
will be enrolled and randomized to perioperative chemo￾therapy (Arm A) or immediate surgery alone with or
without adjuvant chemotherapy (investigator’s choice)
(Arm B). Randomization will occur in a 1:1 ratio with
stratification by clinical tumor stage (T1 and T2 vs. T3
and T4), ECOG (0 and 1 vs. 2) and localization of the
primary (ICC vs. ECC vs. IGBC).
Neoadjuvant chemotherapy with gemcitabine plus cis￾platin will be administered for 3 cycles preoperatively
followed by radical liver resection versus immediate
radical liver resection alone with or without adjuvant
chemotherapy (investigator’s choice) in incidentally de￾tected T2–3N- or pT1-3 N+ gallbladder carcinoma after
simple cholecystectomy or in front of radical resection
of Biliary Tract Cancer (ICC/ECC). After the radical
tumor resection again 3 cycles postoperative chemother￾apy will be administered in the experimental arm. In the
standard (control) arm no perioperative chemotherapy
will be administered. After surgery adjuvant chemother￾apy can be administered by investigator’s choice.
Arm A
Patients will receive gemcitabine (1000 mg/m2
) plus cis￾platin (25 mg/m2
) every 3 weeks on days 1 and 8 intra￾venously. Treatment with gemcitabine plus cisplatin will
be administered for 3 cycles preoperatively and for 3
cycles postoperatively. In case of progressive or
recurrent disease, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of
consent, treatment will be terminated.
Arm B
Patients will receive surgery immediately, without receiving
preoperative chemotherapy. After surgery adjuvant chemo￾therapy can be administered by investigator’s choice. In
both of the treatment arms, tumor assessments (CT or
MRI) are performed before randomization and prior to sur￾gery. Therefore, in patients randomized to Arm A (surgery
+ chemotherapy) there will be an additional staging before
the surgical procedure, after completing 3 cycles of chemo￾therapy. After surgery, tumor assessments are performed
every 3 months until progression/relapse, death or end of
follow-up. During treatment, clinical visits (blood cell
counts, detection of toxicity) occur prior to every treatment
dose. Safety of Cisplatin/ Gemcitabine will be monitored
continuously by careful monitoring of all adverse events
(AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) reported. Please
see Fig. 1 for reference.
Measures of outcomes and assessments
Primary outcome
The primary endpoint is overall survival. The duration
of OS will be determined by measuring the interval from
randomization to the date of death or last observation
(censored).
Secondary outcomes
The main secondary endpoint is QoL. The QoL data will
help us to better integrate a possible gain in OS into the
therapy guidelines. Other secondary outcome measures
are 3-year survival rates as well as the projected 5-year
overall survival rate in addition to progression-free
survival, toxicity, 30 days and 90 days (perioperative)
morbidity and mortality.
Main inclusion criteria
Histologically confirmed incidental gallbladder carcin￾oma (IGBC) (T2–3N- or T1-3N+ after Cholecystectomy)
or Biliary tract cancer (BTC) (intrahepatic, hilar or distal
Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA)) scheduled for complete re￾section (mixed tumor entities with hepatocellular carcin￾oma are excluded). Medical and technical operability of
the primary. No prior chemo- therapy and no prior
tumor resection, for IGBC (T2–3N- or pT1-3 N+) prior
Cholecystectomy is allowed.
Main exclusion criteria
Medical inoperability. Exclusion of distant metastases by
CT or MRI. Exclusion of the infiltration of any adjacent
organs or structures by CT or MRI, indicating an unre￾sectable situation.
Goetze et al. BMC Cancer (2020) 20:122 Page 3 of 8

Treatments
Control(s)/comparator(s)
Gemcitabine/Cisplatin consists of: Gemcitabine will be
administered at a dose of 1000 mg/m2 as 0.5 h infusion
on D1 and D8 Q3W. Cisplatin will be administered
at a dose of 25 mg/m2 as 1 h infusion on D1 and D8
Q3W [27].
Dose, mode and scheme of intervention
In the interventional arm surgery is planned to occur 4
to 6 weeks after D8 of last gemcitabine plus cisplatin
dose (for Arm A) or directly after randomization for
Arm B.
The protocol specifications on surgical treatment re￾flect national guidelines and current expert opinion.
Aim of surgical resection is a margin-free (R0) resection
of the primary tumor. Hepatic resection should be per￾formed to obtain clear margins. In IGBC a radical re- re￾section usually consists of wedge resection of segments
IVb and V or bisegmentectomy of segments IVb and V
as the minimal volume required. Liver resections should
always combined with a standardized lymphadenectomy
for therapeutic and staging reasons.
Sample size calculation
Sample size calculation is based on the results obtained
from the German Registry of Incidental Gallbladder
Carcinoma Platform (GR) and additional theoretical
assumptions to eliminate selection bias. Taken together,
the T2 and T3 data, the median OS of the control arm
was calculated at 24 months. An improvement of OS ac￾cording to a HR of 0.70 is clinically relevant and would
justify the implementation of a burdensome chemother￾apy before major surgery, and is still realistic and within
the frame of improvement achieved in other gastrointes￾tinal malignancies by neoadjuvant/adjuvant concepts.
Assuming a 24 months median OS, the study will enroll
300 patients (1:1) providing 80% power to detect an im￾provement in Hazard ratio of 0.70 in terms of OS (as
assessed by KM-curves) favoring the experimental arm
(log rank test, 1-sided alpha = 0.05). The sample size of
N = 300 includes an exponentially distributed dropout
rate of 10% during the first 3 years of follow-up, result￾ing in n = 272 evaluable patients. The recruitment period
is set at 4 years and the total follow up period (calculated
from last patient in) of 2 years. All patients will be
followed up until end of study, at least 2 years. A total of
n = 333 patients is planned to be screened for the study
with 10% screening failure expected resulting in n = 300
randomized patients.
Monitoring
All adverse events and severe adverse events occurring
after informed consent are recorded in the patient’s
electronic case report form by the responsible site staff.
Adverse events will be assessed according to the
Fig. 1 Study Scheme. BTC (ICC/ ECC) = Biliary Tract cancer (Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma/ Extrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma); IGBC = Incidental
Gallbladder Carcinoma; IRR = Immediate Radical Re-resection

Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events
(CTCAE) version 5.0. With this data the safety will be
monitored continuously by careful monitoring of all
adverse events and serious adverse events reported. A
compilation of all serious adverse events is sent to lead
Ethic, regulatory body and the independent Data Moni￾toring Committee (IDMC). The IDMC furthermore
provides the sponsor with recommendations regarding
study modification, continuation or termination. In this
process the IDMC may give advice for continuation,
changes to the study protocol or termination of the
study. The IDMC may claim unplanned interim analyses
of any variable and – beyond the aforementioned items
– it may ask for any additional activity within the trial if
the activity is on behalf of patients’ security.
Premature termination of the study may also be decided
if unexpected severe surgical complications occur, more
effective therapies become available or if patient enroll￾ment is insufficient. Final decision is made by sponsor rep￾resentative and the lead coordinating investigator.
It is understood that an outside monitor and other
authorized personnel may contact and visit the investi￾gator, and that they will be allowed direct access to
source data/documents for trial-related monitoring, au￾dits, IRB review, and regulatory inspection. Direct access
is defined as permission to examine, analyze, verify, and
reproduce any records and reports that are important to
evaluation of a clinical trial. All reasonable precautions
within the constraints of the applicable regulatory
requirements to maintain the confidentiality of patients’
identities and sponsor’s proprietary information will be
exercised. In case of an audit by the sponsor/sponsor
representative or an appropriate authority, the investiga￾tor will make all relevant documents available.
Ethical considerations, information giving and written
informed consent
The responsible lead ethics committee approved the
protocol of the study on the 11th January 2019 under
the identification number FF108/2018. The trial has
been registered on the ClinicalTrial.gov website under
the identification number NCT03673072 https://clinical￾trials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03673072. The GAIN study
complies with the Declaration of Helsinki rules, the
principles of Good Clinical Practice guidelines and the
Data Protection Act. The trial will also be carried out in
compliance to local legal and regulatory requirements.
For each patient to be enrolled into the study, an obtain￾ing written informed consent prior to inclusion into the
trial is essential.
Discussion
Currently, complete surgical resection represents the
only potentially curative treatment option for Biliary
tract cancer (ICC- Intrahepatic- and ECC – Extrahepatic
Cholangiocarcinoma) including Gallbladder Carcinoma,
and is therefore the treatment of choice if the respect￾ive tumor is deemed resectable [8]. However, more
than 50% of patients already exhibit unresectable dis￾ease at the time of diagnosis [9, 28]. Even after cura￾tive resection, 5-year overall survival (OS) is only 20–
40% [29–36].
Incidental gallbladder carcinoma (IGBC) is identified
after laparoscopic or open cholecystectomy [11–13]. In
this case, a second, stage-adjusted surgery for radical
cholecystectomy (immediate radical re-resection = IRR),
including liver resection and lymph node dissection rep￾resents the state of the art, and national guidelines rec￾ommend this approach [23, 37]. Nevertheless, there are
major problems related to the management of patients
with IGBC: First, surgical therapy remains inadequate
[16, 38–40], since less than 50% of patients affected in
Germany receive the required radical surgery [22].
Second, even after radical surgery, the outcome of pa￾tients with sub-serosal or liver invading pT2–3 stage
(the majority of the tumors) remains poor [13]. According
to the German Registry of Incidental Gallbladder Carcin￾oma (GR), the 5-year OS of T2 stage is 38% with IRR and
22% without IRR [17, 21]. In T3 carcinomas, the 5-year
OS is 18% with IRR and 12% without IRR [17, 21].
5-year survival for completely resected bile duct and
GBC patients ranges between 20 and 50%. Locoregional
failure is observed in more than 50% of patients, even in
absence of residual disease (R0) and provides the justifi￾cation for the study of adjuvant therapy. Previously, the
role of adjuvant systemic chemotherapy for resected
biliary tract carcinomas is not clearly defined. Phase III
trials in this setting had not demonstrated a survival ad￾vantage in CCA, but these studies have included a range
of tumor types (including pancreatobiliary, gallbladder
and ampullary carcinomas) and have failed to show suf￾ficient power to identify a survival difference specifically
in CCA [41, 42]. However, recently the results of the
phase III UK BILCAP trial have been presented [43, 44].
This large phase III randomized trial recruited patients
with resected biliary cancer including 368 (plus 79 gall￾bladder carcinomas) cholangiocarcinoma patients and
randomized between no adjuvant chemotherapy or 6
mo application of oral drug capecitabine. Patients
treated with capecitabine showed an improved overall
survival [53 mo vs 36 mo HR = 0.75 (95% CI: 0.58–0.97;
P = 0.028)]. The results will lead to adjuvant chemo￾therapy with capecitabine being adopted as a potential
therapeutic option in resected biliary cancers, but the
overall study is nevertheless negative according to the
intention- to- treat- population. We have also no data
about the radicalness of surgery especially in gallblad￾der carcinoma patients within the British study. Only
Goetze et al. BMC Cancer (2020) 20:122 Page 5 of 8

macroscopically complete resection with curative intent
was needed in BILCAP.
To conclude, there are trends for an improvement in
OS due to adjuvant chemotherapy, but data demonstrat￾ing a significant improvement for adding adjuvant ther￾apy after a curative resection are lacking [44, 45]. Liver
transplantation is not a standard treatment for CCA due
historically high relapse rates and donor shortage. More
modern series have reported more encouraging results
[46]. Potential candidates, such as patients with poor
hepatic reserve for extended hepatectomy or those with
a localized but irresectable perihilar biliary tract carcin￾oma should be enrolled on to suitable clinical studies.
Locoregional therapies, including radiotherapy, photo￾dynamic therapy, chemo/radio-embolization and radio￾frequency ablation may have a role in locally advanced
malignancies or patients who are surgically not fit. There
is a lack of comparative clinical study evidence to sup￾port any of these options improving survival compared
to standard of care systemic therapy [8]. However, retro￾spective and phase II data suggest a promising rate of
local control by adding radiotherapy in the management
of ICC, and warrants investigation in the future [47, 48].
Because of high rates of disease recurrence and poor
survival rates in IGBC and ICC/ECC following surgical re￾section and the inadequacy of treatment modalities in the
pure adjuvant therapy there is a need for an earlier inter￾vention in the course of the disease. Due to the prognostic
improvements of patients in other tumor entities (gastric,
colorectal e.g. [49, 50]) treated with neoadjuvant or peri￾operative therapy there is a strong rationale to use these
concepts in biliary and gallbladder cancers.
The current proposed phase III GAIN study investigates
whether induction chemotherapy followed by radical re￾section in ICC/ECC and re-resection in IGBC (and – if
possible – postoperative chemotherapy) prolongs overall
survival compared to radical surgery alone for incidental
gallbladder carcinoma and primary resectable or border￾line resectable cholangiocarcinoma. Utilizing a neoadju￾vant approach including a second radical surgery will help
to raise awareness for the necessity of radical surgery, es￾pecially second radical completion surgery in IGBC and
improve the adherence to the guidelines.
