Abstract
The heart is critically dependent on mitochondrial respiration for energy supply. Ischemia
decreases oxygen availability, with catastrophic consequences for cellular energy systems.
After a few minutes of ischemia, the mitochondrial respiratory chain halts, ATP levels drop
and ion gradients across cell membranes collapse. Activation of cellular proteases and gen￾eration of reactive oxygen species by mitochondria during ischemia alter mitochondrial
membrane permeability, causing mitochondrial swelling and fragmentation and eventually
cell death. The mitochondria, therefore, are important targets of cardioprotection against
ischemic injury. We have previously shown that ixazomib (IXA), a proteasome inhibitor used
for treating multiple myeloma, effectively reduced the size of the infarct produced by global
ischemia in isolated rat hearts and prevented degradation of the sarcoplasmic reticulum cal￾cium release channel RyR2. The aim of this work was to further characterize the protective
effect of IXA by determining its effect on mitochondrial morphology and function after ische￾mia. We also quantified the effect of IXA on levels of mitofusin-2, a protein involved in main￾taining mitochondrial morphology and mitochondria-SR communication. We found that
mitochondria were significantly preserved and functional parameters such as oxygen con￾sumption, the ability to generate a membrane potential, and glutathione content were
improved in mitochondria isolated from hearts perfused with IXA prior to ischemia. IXA also
blocked the release of cytochrome c observed in ischemia and significantly preserved mito￾fusin-2 integrity. These beneficial effects resulted in a significant decrease in the left ventric￾ular end diastolic pressure upon reperfusion and a smaller infarct in isolated hearts.

Introduction
The search for protective measures against cardiac ischemia/reperfusion injury has been a
matter of active research for the last 30 years. Therapeutic interventions at the onset of reperfu￾sion can limit the damage produced by ischemia, but outcomes after reperfusion remain criti￾cally dependent on the degree and duration of ischemia [1]. Cardiac tissue is highly dependent
on mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation for energy production, and when oxygen avail￾ability is low, the mitochondrial respiratory rate falls, ATP levels drop, and whole-cell homeo￾stasis is impaired. Alteration of ionic gradients across mitochondrial membranes causes loss of
membrane potential, swelling and disorganization of cristae, fragmentation of mitochondria
and the release of molecules that eventually produce cell death [2,3]. Therefore, therapeutic
measures to prevent or delay mitochondrial damage during ischemia would increase the resis￾tance of the heart to ischemic injury and would undoubtedly be an advantage in those cases
where myocardial ischemia can be programmed in advance, such as heart surgeries or organ
transplantation.
Many proteins are degraded during ischemia by the proteolytic action of the 20S protea￾some, including ryanodine receptors (RyR2), the calcium release channels located in the sarco￾plasmic reticulum (SR). RyR2 are rapidly oxidized and degraded during myocardial ischemia,
significantly impacting cardiac performance [4,5]. The 20S proteasome has three main proteo￾lytic activities: chymotrypsin-like (CT-like), caspase-like and trypsin-like activities. In a recent
work, we showed that after 30 minutes of global ischemia in isolated rat hearts, CT-like activity
increases by 60%, while caspase-like and trypsin-like catalytic activities remain unchanged [6].
Inhibition of CT-like activity with ixazomib (IXA), a proteasome inhibitor currently used in
patients with multiple myeloma [7], prevents RyR2 degradation during ischemia and signifi￾cantly improves cell survival after ischemia/reperfusion [6]. In the heart, the SR and mitochon￾dria are physically connected, forming microdomains that allow for the transfer of calcium
from the SR to the mitochondria so that mitochondrial energy production can satisfy energy
requirements [8,9]. Several proteins are involved in the organization of SR-mitochondria
microdomains, including RyR2 and mitofusin-2 (Mfn2), a GTPase localized to the microdo￾mains known as mitochondrial associated membranes, that include the SR [10,11]. Mfn2 also
regulates mitochondrial fusion [12] and respiratory chain function by maintaining mitochon￾drial levels of coenzyme Q [13]. Mitochondrial function is therefore critically dependent on
Mfn2 integrity. Under stress conditions, such as ischemia, Mfn2 is phosphorylated and
degraded by the proteasome [14]. As a consequence of the degradation of this and other pro￾teins, mitochondria undergo fragmentation and degradation. The effect of IXA on post-ische￾mia mitochondrial function has not been investigated before and since this inhibitor
effectively protected RyR2, one of the proteins involved in the SR-mitochondrial association,
we aimed to determine whether Mfn2 degradation can be prevented by IXA; and to evaluate
the effect of the drug on the functional and morphologic changes to the mitochondria that
occur during ischemia but before reperfusion in isolated rat hearts.

Experimental protocol
Hearts were excised under deep anesthesia with pentobarbital (80 mg/kg, intraperitoneal) and
rapidly perfused at 37˚C via the ascending aorta at a constant flow of 10–14 mL/minute, using
a peristaltic infusion pump with Krebs-Henseleit solution containing (in mmol/L): 128.3
NaCl, 4.7 KCl, 1.35 CaCl2, 1.1 MgSO4, 20.2 NaHCO3, 0.4 NaH2PO4, and 11.1 glucose, at a pH
of 7.4, equilibrated with a gas mixture of 95% O2/5% CO2. A latex balloon was inserted into
the left ventricle and connected to a pressure transducer to measure hemodynamic
parameters.
Experimental groups. Control group (N = 15): Hearts were perfused with Krebs buffer solu￾tion for 50 minutes. Ischemia group (N = 15): hearts were stabilized for 20 minutes with Krebs
buffer solution, followed by 30 minutes of global ischemia at 37˚C. Control group with IXA
(N = 9): Hearts were stabilized for 10 minutes with Krebs buffer solution, followed by 10 min￾utes of perfusion with Krebs plus the proteasome inhibitor ixazomib (IXA, 0.10 μmol/L), and
then 30 minutes of perfusion with Krebs buffer. Ischemia group with IXA (N = 9): Hearts were
stabilized for 10 minutes with Krebs buffer solution, followed by 10 minutes of perfusion with
IXA, and then 30 minutes of global ischemia.
Immediately after ischemia, or the equivalent time in controls, heart ventricles were snap￾frozen in liquid nitrogen, reduced to powder under liquid N2, and kept under argon atmo￾sphere at -80˚C.
Infarct size measurement
Hearts subjected to ischemia in the absence (N = 10) or in the presence of IXA (N = 10) were
reperfused with Krebs solution for 60 minutes and then perfused with triphenyltetrazolium
chloride (TTC, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) to measure the infarct size as described previ￾ously [15].
Proteasome activity
Whole-ventricle homogenates were prepared from frozen tissue, and chymotrypsin-like activ￾ity of the proteasome was determined as described previously [6,16].
Quantification of mitochondrial DNA
Total DNA from ventricular tissue was obtained using DNAzol1 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA,
USA) following the manufacturer’s instructions. The homogenate was centrifuged at 10,000 x
g for 10 minutes at 4ºC. Ethanol was added to the supernatant to precipitate total DNA. Mito￾chondrial DNA (mtDNA) was quantified by detecting D-loop with the PCR primers, F:
5’GGT TCT TAC TTC AGG GCC ATC A-3’ and R: 5’-GAT TAG ACC CGT TAC
CAT CGA GAT-3’. β-actin, used as a housekeeping gene, was detected with specific primers:
F: 5’-GGG ATG TTT GCT CCA ACC AA-3’ and R: 5’-GCG CTT TTG ACT CAA
GGA TTT AA-3’. The 2-ΔΔCt method was used to calculate relative transcript abundance.
Preparation of mitochondria
Frozen ventricles were homogenized with a Dounce glass Teflon homogenizer with 6 volumes
of buffer solution consisting of (in mmol/L): 225 mannitol, 75 sucrose, 0.5 EGTA-K, 30
TRIS-HCl, at a pH 7.4, with 0.5% BSA. The crude mitochondrial fraction was isolated by dif￾ferential centrifugation according the procedure described by Wieckowski [17]. The superna￾tant of the mitochondrial fraction was saved to measure cytochrome c content by Western
blot.

Oxygen consumption
Mitochondrial fractions were incubated in a buffer containing (in mmol/L): 225 mannitol, 75
sucrose, 0.5 EGTA-K, 30 TRIS-HCl, at pH 7.4, with 0.5% BSA supplemented with 25 mmol/L
succinate and 1.65 mmol/L ADP and the fluorescent probe MitoXpress a 37ºC. Samples were
covered with a layer of mineral oil, according to the manufacturer’s recommendations (MitoX￾press 1, catalog # 600800, Cayman Chemical, MI-USA) and the light excited at 380 nm and
emitted at 650 nm was measured in a plate reader. The results were normalized with respect to
controls and expressed in arbitrary units of fluorescence/minute/mg of protein.
Mitochondrial membrane potential
Mitochondrial fractions were incubated in a solution containing 110 mM KCl, 10 mM ATP,
10 mM MgCl2, 10 mM sodium succinate, 1 mM EGTA and 20 mM MOPS, pH 7.5 and the
fluorescent probe JC-1 (Catalog Number J4519, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) according
manufacturer´s recommendations. JC-1 aggregates in polarized mitochondria and changes its
fluorescent emission. Fluorescence was excited at 490 and the ratio of emitted light at 590/540
nm was measured. The results were expressed in arbitrary units of fluorescence/mg protein.
Glutathione content
Total glutathione (GSH + GSSG) concentration was determined in isolated mitochondria as
described by Griffith [18].
Western blot analysis
Proteins were separated by electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gel (8 or 15% gels), transferred
to PVDF membranes (Bio-Rad), and immunoblotted. The primary antibodies used were: anti￾Mfn2 (ab50483, lot# GR297107-2, Abcam, Cambridge, UK), anti-cytochrome c (C5723, lot#
038K1427, Sigma Chemicals Co., St. Louis, MO), anti-GAPDH (G9547, lot# 026M4836V,
Sigma Chemicals Co., St. Louis, MO). Antigen-antibody reactions were detected by ECL
(Amersham Biosciences), and blots were quantified using Image Lab software. Results were
normalized to GADPH. Protein concentration was determined using the bicinchoninic acid
assay (Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit; Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL).
Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM)
Immediately after the experiment, the ischemic hearts were perfused for 30 minutes with a
solution of 3% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 mol/L sodium phosphate buffer, at a pH of 7.3, and
treated with 1% osmium tetroxide. Samples were dehydrated in ethanol solutions of increasing
concentrations and finally placed in EPON resin. Sections, 60-nm thick, were cut from the tis￾sue and mounted on electron microscopy grids. Images were acquired using a transmission
electron microscope at 80 kV (Philips Tecnai 12, at the Advanced Microscopy Facility, Pontifi￾cia Universidad Cato´lica) or in a high-resolution scanning electron microscope (Inspect F50,
FEI, at the Microscopy Facility of the Facultad de Ciencias Quı´micas, Universidad de Chile) at
10kV with a STEM detector.
Statistical analysis
Data are expressed as mean ± SEM. Data were analyzed using Kruskal-Wallis test followed by
Dunn´s test. When comparing two groups Student’s t-test was used. Differences were consid￾ered significant at p<0.05.

Results
Inhibition of CT-like activity of the proteasome prevents mitofusin-2
degradation during ischemia
We found that Mfn2 was highly sensitive to ischemia, decreasing by 60% after 30 minutes of
global ischemia in isolated hearts. This decrease was prevented when the hearts were previ￾ously perfused with IXA (Fig 1A). As shown previously, the increase in proteasomal CT-like
activity observed after ischemia was also inhibited by IXA (Fig 1B), suggesting that Mfn2 was
degraded by the proteasome. This effect is similar to the previously-reported inhibition of
RyR2 degradation by IXA during ischemia [6]. We did not observe changes in mitochondrial
DNA after 30 minutes of ischemia (Fig 1C), suggesting that mitochondrial mass did not
change during this period. Likewise, we found no degradation of other mitochondrial proteins
such as Mitofusin-1 or Fis-1, both localized to the outer mitochondrial membrane, nor in
OPA-1 or COX IV, both integral proteins of the inner mitochondrial membrane or in Cyclofi￾lin D, a mitochondrial matrix protein, suggesting that the degradation of Mfn2 is not the result
of the generalized degradation of proteins after ischemia (S1 Fig).
Ixazomib preserves mitochondrial function during ischemia
To evaluate the effect of IXA on the functional status of the mitochondria, we measured oxy￾gen consumption and the capacity of isolated mitochondria to generate a membrane potential

in the presence of respiratory substrates and cofactors. Oxygen consumption by mitochondria
isolated from ischemic hearts was reduced to less than 10% of control levels but showed only a
40% reduction when ischemia was performed in the presence of IXA (Fig 2A). To evaluate the
ability to generate a potential difference across the inner mitochondrial membrane we mea￾sured the accumulation of the lipophilic cationic dye JC-1. Mitochondria isolated from ische￾mic hearts accumulated significantly less JC-1 suggesting that they produced a smaller
membrane potential difference than controls (Fig 2B). IXA significantly prevented the
decrease in JC-1 accumulation observed after ischemia (Fig 2B). We also measured

soluble fraction of ischemic hearts (Fig 2C). This effect was completely prevented by IXA, con￾firming the protective effect of the inhibitor on the mitochondria.
An important cause of ischemia-induced mitochondrial dysfunction is the generation of
ROS, which oxidize lipids and proteins. Mitochondria maintain their own pool of glutathione
[19], which is involved in the protection of thiol groups, detoxification of peroxides, and other
redox reactions in the mitochondrial matrix. Mitochondrial glutathione content is an indirect
index of ROS generation. We found that the glutathione (GSH + GSSG) content in isolated
mitochondria was greatly decreased after ischemia and this was largely prevented by IXA (Fig
2D). IXA did not modify any of the above-mentioned mitochondrial parameters when infused
into control hearts. Taken together, these results suggest that IXA protects mitochondria from
the damage produced by ischemia.
Ixazomib attenuates the morphological changes to the mitochondria
produced by ischemia
The results shown above suggest that IXA protects the mitochondria during ischemia. To test
this observation at a morphological level, we analyzed transmission electron microscopy
images of cardiac tissue subjected to ischemia in the presence or absence of the drug. A longi￾tudinal section of a control heart not subjected to ischemia, in which interfibrillar mitochon￾dria arranged between sarcomeres can be appreciated, is shown in Fig 3A. IXA did not alter
the mitochondrial ultrastructure under control conditions (Fig 3B). Fig 3C shows a section of
cardiac tissue after 30 minutes of global ischemia. Ischemia provoked significant tissue dam￾age, as demonstrated by disorganized sarcomeres and swollen mitochondria with disorganized
cristae and a less electron-dense matrix (Fig 3C). Higher resolution images of particularly
swollen mitochondria (increased area and lower electron density) accompanied by aberrant
cristae in terms of transversal continuity and frequency are shown in Fig 3D and 3E. These
changes were markedly reduced by the presence of IXA during ischemia (Fig 3F) indicating
that proteasome inhibition protected the mitochondrial structure. Average mitochondrial
morphological parameters after ischemia in the presence and absence of IXA are shown in
Table 1. In summary, ischemia increased mitochondrial area (Fig 3G, Table 1) and perimeter
(Fig 3H, Table 1) due to swelling and both indices were significantly decreased when ischemia
was performed in the presence of IXA.

10 minutes of ischemia (Fig 4A). Reperfusion strongly exacerbated the increase in LVEDP that
remained elevated during the following hour of reperfusion (Fig 4A). In the presence of IXA,
the increase in LVEDP during ischemia was smaller and developed later, indicating that the
myocardium remained viable for a longer period (Fig 4A). Likewise, LVEDP after one hour of
reperfusion was lower in hearts treated with IXA (Fig 4A).These effects are summarized in Fig
4B and 4C. The reductions in these variables imply a decrease in tissue damage during ische￾mia, resulting in a significantly lower infarct size in the presence of IXA (Fig 4D).

Discussion
This work extends our prior findings on the protective effects of IXA during myocardial ische￾mia [6]. The previously-observed decrease in infarct size in the presence of IXA prompted us
to study the effect of this inhibitor on mitochondrial morphology and function during ische￾mia. Due to its elevated energy requirements, the heart is highly dependent on mitochondrial
respiration, and practically all of the ATP required by the heart is generated by oxidative phos￾phorylation. Interruption of the blood supply causes a rapid drop in ATP production, with a
consequent decline in contractile force and loss of cellular homeostasis. Oxygen deprivation
provokes time-dependent mitochondrial damage that eventually becomes irreversible and
produces cell death. Therefore, mitochondria are important targets for cardioprotection. We
specifically analyzed the effect of IXA on Mfn2 as this protein plays a critical role not only in
mitochondrial dynamics, but also in communication between the mitochondria and sarcoplas￾mic reticulum [9], as well as in other aspects of cell metabolism [20]. IXA was very effective in
reducing mitochondrial damage during ischemia, as indicated by the preservation of mito￾chondrial morphology and improvement in mitochondrial function indices such as oxygen
consumption, membrane potential, and glutathione content. Importantly, IXA blocked the
release of cyt c from the mitochondria into the cytosol, which otherwise would initiate activa￾tion of the intrinsic apoptosis pathway [21], contributing to tissue death. The loss of cyt c
would also contribute to the decrease in ATP generation during ischemia, even before oxygen
is depleted. Moreover, cytc is a ROS scavenger. Loss of cyt c, therefore, would further contrib￾ute to mitochondrial damage, as suggested by the decrease in mitochondrial GSH levels. Con￾sistently, IXA delayed the onset and decreased the amplitude of LVEDP, resulting in a
significant reduction in infarct size.
The role of Mfn2 in mitochondrial structure and function in adult hearts is complex and
not yet fully understood. IXA not only prevented the degradation of Mfn2 during ischemia but
also, as we showed before, of RyR2 [6]. Since both proteins are present in SR-mitochondria
associated membranes, these results suggest that the preservation of this interaction is impor￾tant for cell survival under stress. In addition to the above-mentioned involvement in mito￾chondrial metabolism and SR-mitochondria communication, Mfn2 also protects neurons
from apoptotic death following ischemia/reperfusion by modulating mitophagy, a process
needed to rid the cells of damaged mitochondria [22]. Certainly, Mfn2 is unlikely to be the
only protein preserved by proteasome inhibition during ischemia, but our data suggests that
avoiding its degradation has an important role in the protection conferred by IXA.
The first attempts to inhibit the proteasome as a therapeutic measure against ischemia/
reperfusion injury were highly controversial. Beneficial [23,24] or deleterious [25,26] effects
were observed in various models of ischemia using different inhibitors and concentrations.
We [6] and others [27,28] have shown that the degree of proteasome inhibition is critical to
the protective effect. As shown in our previous work, the IXA concentrations used here only
inhibit CT-like activity, without affecting proteasomal activities of caspase or trypsin-like activ￾ity. Inhibition of caspase-like activity associated with higher concentrations of IXA may cause
undesired effects [6].
Most studies on ischemia/reperfusion injury focus on the injury produced at reperfusion,
since ischemia typically occurs without prior warning. Nevertheless, irreversible damage and
cell death begin during ischemia, and our results emphasize the need to protect the mitochon￾dria during the ischemic period itself. Pharmacological approaches to prevent mitochondrial
damage have yet to be translated into clinically-relevant therapeutic measures against myocar￾dial ischemia. One of the reasons for this lack of success may be that many of the relevant
experimental drugs are not currently approved for human use. Proteasome inhibition by IXA

may be a feasible way to protect the heart from ischemic damage in cases where it is known in
advance that ischemia will occur (cardiac surgery with extracorporeal circulation, for
instance), as the drug is currently used in patients with multiple myeloma [29]. Furthermore,
the IXA concentrations used in this study are similar to plasma concentrations of IXA in mul￾tiple myeloma patients [30], suggesting that a significant protective effect against myocardial
ischemia can be achieved with pharmacological concentrations of the drug.
Limitation of the study
We acknowledge the following limitations that should be addressed in future studies: a) ROS
formation was not directly assessed during ischemia. This determination is challenging in Lan￾gendorff perfused hearts and it was not possible to perform under our protocol of ischemia. B)
It would have been also desirable to determine the extent of mitochondrial fusion and fission
in hearts treated with IXA. However, there are methodological restrictions to effectively mea￾sure mitochondrial fusion or fission in the heart. c) The effect of IXA on changes in gene
expression (mRNA levels) associated with cardiac energetics was not investigated in the pres￾ent work. It would be important to determine changes in mRNA levels associated with cardiac
energetics within the first 30 min as previously reported in other studies [31, 32].
Conclusion
Given its low toxicity and adequate tolerance [33], ixazomib may be a useful drug to protect
cardiac mitochondria in cases of programmed ischemia.
Supporting information
S1 Fig. Critical mitochondrial proteins remained unchanged after 30 minutes of ischemia
in isolated rat hearts. Proteins were quantified by Western blots in whole heart homogenates
from control or ischemic hearts. The antibodies used were the following: anti Mitofusin 1 (cat
# ab104274, Abcam, Cambridge, UK; anti FIS-1 (cat # PA5-22142, Thermo Scientific, Wal￾tham, MA, USA); anti OPA-1 (cat # sc-367890, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA);
COX IV (cat # 4844, Cell Signaling Technologies, Danvers, MA, USA); Cyclophilin D (cat #
AP1035, Merck, Burlington, MA, USA). Protein content was normalized by the content of
GAPDH (cat # G9547, Sigma Chemicals Co., St. Louis, MO). Bars show Mean ± S.E.M values
of western blots like those shown on top, obtained in 4 different hearts.
