Acute activation of the serine-threonine kinase Akt is cardioprotective and reduces both infarction and dys￾function after ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI). However, less is known about the chronic effects of Akt
activation in the heart, and, paradoxically, Aktis activated in samples from patients with chronic heartfailure.
We generated Tg mice with cardiac-specific expression of either activated (myristoylated [myr]) or dominant￾negative (dn) Akt and assessed their response to IRI in an ex vivo model. While dn-Akt hearts demonstrated
a moderate reduction in functional recovery after IRI, no function was restored in any of the myr-Akt–Tg
hearts. Moreover, infarcts were dramatically larger in myr-Akt–Tg hearts. Biochemical analyses demonstrated
that chronic Akt activation induces feedback inhibition of PI3K activity through both proteasome-dependent
degradation of insulin receptor substrate–1 (IRS-1) and inhibition of transcription of IRS-1 as well as that of
IRS-2. To testthe functional significance ofthese signaling changes, we performed in vivo cardiac gene transfer
with constitutively active PI3K in myr-Akt–Tg mice. Restoration of PI3K rescued function and reduced injury
after IRI. These data demonstrate that PI3K-dependent but Akt-independent effectors are required for full
cardioprotection and suggest a mechanism by which chronic Akt activation can become maladaptive.
Introduction
Death of cardiomyocytes results in decreased cardiac function, 
which correlates with overall morbidity and mortality in many 
different clinical settings. For these reasons, understanding the 
intracellular signaling pathways that control cardiomyocyte sur￾vival has significant clinical implications.
Insulin and IGF-1 have beneficial effects on cardiomyocyte func￾tion and survival (1–6), including protection against acute isch￾emic injury (5, 7). Tg mice with cardiac-specific IGF-1 overexpres￾sion driven by the α–myosin heavy chain (α-MHC) promoter (2) 
demonstrate less cardiomyocyte death and fibrosis with chronic 
coronary artery narrowing (6), as well as reduced injury in an ex 
vivo model of ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI) (7). Activation of 
the serine-threonine kinase Akt is thought to play an important 
role in promoting cardiomyocyte survival in response to IGF-1 
and similar ligands, and acute activation of Akt is cardioprotec￾tive in vitro and in vivo (8–10). However, little is known about the 
effects of chronic Akt activation, and, paradoxically, samples from 
humans with advanced heart failure demonstrate enhanced Akt 
phosphorylation (11), which suggests either that Akt activation is 
not sufficient for long-term cardioprotection or that it may actu￾ally have adverse effects over time.
Tyrosine kinase receptors, including the insulin and IGF-1 
receptors, initiate signaling via the adaptor molecule insulin 
receptor substrate–1 (IRS-1), which docks with the SH2 domains 
of the p85 PI3K regulatory subunit (12). Genetic deletion of IRS-1 
led to identification of IRS-2, an accessory adaptor that can acti￾vate PI3K and may be particularly important with deletion or 
inhibition of IRS-1 (13). Activation of PI3K leads to phosphory￾lation of membrane phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate 
[PI(4,5)P2], which generates PI(3,4,5)P3, some of which is con￾verted to phosphatidylinositol 3,4-trisphosphate [PI(3,4)P2] by a 
phospholipid phosphatase. PI(3,4)P2 and PI(3,4,5)P3 recruit Akt 
and phosphoinositide-dependent kinase–1 (PDK1) to the cell 
membrane by binding their pleckstrin homology domains, which 
leads to phosphorylation and activation of Akt (14–16). Because 
PDK1 is constitutively active, movement of Akt to the sarcolem￾mal membrane is sufficient for activation, and incorporation of 
the src myristoylation signal creates a constitutively active Akt 
mutant (8), which then distributes throughout the cell (ref. 17 
and data not shown). Of note, although many of the prosurvival 
benefits of PI3K in the heart have been ascribed to activation of 
Akt, PI3K also signals through other effectors that are structur￾ally similar to Akt, share overlapping substrate specificity, and 
promote cell survival in other systems, such as serum- and gluco￾corticoid-regulated kinase–1 (SGK1) (18). Interestingly, we have

recently found that SGK1 is dynamically regulated in the heart 
and promotes cardiomyocyte survival (19).
To better understand the effects of chronic Akt activation in the 
heart, we generated Tg mice (20) with cardiac-specific expression 
of the same myristoylated Akt (myr-Akt) construct that protects 
cardiomyocytes in vitro (8) and in vivo (10). These mice have con￾centric cardiac hypertrophy without overt signs of cardiac disease 
(20). In the current study, we examined the response of hearts from 
these mice in an ex vivo model of IRI. We found that chronic Akt 
activation resulted in decreased functional recovery and increased 
injury after IRI. The mechanisms and implications of this observa￾tion were explored in further detail.
Results
Baseline cardiac function. Baseline function in hearts from Tg myr￾Akt (myr-Akt–Tg) and dominant-negative Akt (dn-Akt–Tg) and 
nontransgenic (NTg) mice was examined in the ex vivo Langen￾dorff model (Table 1). myr-Akt–Tg hearts manifested moderate 
increases in both positive and negative dP/dt. Coronary flow was 
also increased in myr-Akt–Tg mice. The mean LV systolic pressure 
(LVSP) and LV end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP), LV developed pres￾sure (LVDP), and heart rate were not significantly different com￾pared with those in NTg mice. dn-Akt–Tg hearts manifested mod￾estly increased LVEDP but otherwise comparable cardiac function 
at baseline. Because echocardiography had previously suggested 
a nonsignificant trend toward decreased cardiac function in myr￾Akt–Tg mice in vivo (20), we performed invasive hemodynamic 
analyses of myr-Akt–Tg compared with NTg mice (Table 2). Iso￾volumic contraction (e.g., maximum dP/dt) was similar between 
groups. However, ejection-phase parameters such as end-systolic 
elastance were impaired in myr-Akt–Tg hearts, which contributed 
to reduced stroke work and power output. These data are consis￾tent with a moderate reduction in cardiac function in vivo. Differ￾ences from the ex vivo results likely reflect differences in afterload, 
neurohumoral input, and anesthetic effects.
Functional recovery after IRI. After 20-minute control perfusion, 
hearts were exposed to 20-minute global ischemia followed by 
40-minute reperfusion, while cardiac function was monitored 
in the Langendorff model (Figure 1, A and B). In NTg hearts, 
LVDP recovered to 53.5% ± 3.4% of its starting value during 
reperfusion. dn-Akt–Tg hearts manifested moderately impaired 
recovery, achieving a maximum LVDP 34.4% ± 7.5% of baseline, 
consistent with a cardioprotective role for endogenous Akt. In 
contrast, no cardiac function was restored in any of the myr￾Akt–Tg hearts, a result that was significantly worse than those 
in either the NTg or dn-Akt hearts.
Cardiac injury after IRI. The activity of creatine phosphokinase 
(CPK) released into the perfusate during reperfusion was mea￾sured as an index of injury. During control perfusion, no CPK 
activity was detectable (data not shown). After IRI, significant 
CPK activity was detectable in the perfusate of NTg hearts, and 
there was a nonsignificant trend toward increased CPK in dn￾Akt–Tg hearts (P = 0.068 vs. NTg; Figure 1C). Remarkably, CPK 
was increased 35-fold in myr-Akt–Tg compared with NTg hearts 
(P < 0.005; Figure 1C). This correlated with dramatically larger 
infarcts in myr-Akt–Tg hearts (80.5% ± 3.1% vs. 32.6% ± 9.8%; 
P < 0.005; Figure 1D). After IRI, there was a nonsignificant trend 
toward reduced DNA laddering in myr-Akt–Tg hearts at both 5 
and 40 minutes of reperfusion (Figure 1E). Thus, the increased 
injury seen in myr-Akt–Tg hearts is not due to increased apoptosis 
but may reflect an increase in other forms of cell death.
IRS-1/PI3K signaling is markedly inhibited in myr-Akt–Tg mice. To 
explore possible mechanisms for these results, we examined signal￾ing in myr-Akt–Tg compared with NTg hearts. As noted previous￾ly, no difference was seen in MAPK pathways (20). While baseline 
activities of immunoprecipitated PI3K isoforms (110-α, -β, -γ) were 
comparable (Supplemental Figure 1; supplemental material avail￾able online with this article; doi:10.1172/JCI23073DS1), IRS-1–
associated PI3K activity was dramatically inhibited both at base￾line and after either insulin stimulation or ischemia/reperfusion 
(Figure 2, A and B; Supplemental Figure 2). This reduced activ￾ity correlated with reduced IRS-1–associated PI3K in myr-Akt–Tg 
hearts even after insulin stimulation (Figure 2C).
While PI3K expression was comparable in myr-Akt–Tg and NTg 
mice, IRS-1 was reduced in myr-Akt–Tg mice (Figure 2D), which sug￾gests that loss of IRS-1 largely accounts for decreased IRS-1–associ￾ated PI3K activation. We also examined IRS-1 in an independent, 
X-linked (TG20) line of myr-Akt–Tg mice with lower levels of Akt 
expression and activation (20). Male TG20 mice also exhibited a sig￾nificant though less-marked reduction in IRS-1, which was further 
attenuated in chimeric hearts of female TG20 mice, consistent with 
an Akt dosage effect (Figure 2D).
Serine phosphorylation of IRS-1 can both inhibit PI3K activa￾tion (21) and induce IRS-1 degradation (22). Using an antibody

specific for the phosphorylated form of the Akt consensus sub￾strate (catalog 9611; Cell Signaling Technology), we saw a rela￾tive increase (compared with the reduction in total IRS-1) in Akt 
target phosphorylation migrating at the same position as immu￾noreactive IRS-1 in myr-Akt–Tg hearts (Figure 2E). These obser￾vations raise the possibility that Akt phosphorylation of IRS-1 
could contribute to IRS-1 degradation. To see whether these 
effects simply reflect the nonphysiological activation of Akt in our 
Tg mice, we examined IRS-1 in hearts from Akt1-null mice (23). 
While impaired placental development and fetal growth in these 
mice limited the numbers available for study, immunoblotting 
revealed an increase in IRS-1 protein levels that was substantial 
in Akt1–/– and more modest in Akt1+/– hearts (Figure 2F). IRS-1 
levels in dn-Akt–Tg were not significantly different from those in 
NTg hearts. This difference may reflect the incomplete inhibition 
of Akt1 signaling seen in these mice (Supplemental Figure 3) that 
only comes on in the ventricle after birth. In contrast, Akt1–/– mice 
have complete loss of Akt1 signaling, and Akt1+/– mice exhibit 
moderate reduction in Akt1 that is present throughout develop￾ment. Interestingly, IRS-1 mRNA was also reduced by 68.7% in 
myr-Akt–Tg (n = 7) compared with NTg hearts (n = 5; P < 0.001). 
Thus, loss of IRS-1 in myr-Akt–Tg correlates with Akt activation 
and reflects physiological IRS-1 regulatory mechanisms that are 
enhanced in the myr-Akt–Tg and lost in the Akt-null mice.
IRS-2 can also activate PI3K and may be particularly impor￾tant in the setting of reduced IRS-1 levels (13). Interestingly, 
IRS-2 mRNA and protein levels were also reduced in myr-Akt–Tg 
according to quantitative RT-PCR (QRT-PCR) and immunoblot￾ting: 59.9% and 42.4% respectively (P < 0.005 and P < 0.02, respec￾tively). Thus, in addition to reducing the primary adaptor acti￾vating the isoform of PI3K including the 110α catalytic domain 
(PI3Kα), Akt1 activation leads to inhibition of the accessory path￾way, thereby severely impairing PI3K activation.
Akt activation induces proteasome-dependent degradation of IRS-1. To 
further explore the mechanism of reduced IRS-1 protein, we exam￾ined neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (NRCMs) in vitro (Figure 3). 
Stimulation with either insulin or IGF-1 (data not shown) for 
20 hours triggered a reduction in IRS-1 protein levels, as did 
stimulation with adenoviral myr-Akt (Ad.myr-Akt; Figure 3A). In 
both cases, IRS-1 degradation was inhibited by the proteasome 
inhibitor ALLN but not the structural control, ALLM, a protease 
inhibitor with poor affinity for the proteasome (24). To examine

IRS-1 phosphorylation, we infected NRCMs with Ad.IRS-1 and 
the indicated adenoviral vectors. Immunoprecipitation of IRS-1 
followed by immunoblotting for phosphorylated Akt substrate 
revealed an increase in phosphorylated IRS-1 levels after insulin 
stimulation or expression of myr-Akt but not dn-Akt or control 
virus (Figure 3B). Thus, Akt activation is sufficient to induce 
IRS-1 phosphorylation and proteasome-dependent degradation 
in cardiomyocytes.
IRS-1 is preserved in IGF-1–Tg mice. Given the results described 
above, one might anticipate that IRS-1 would also be reduced in 
IGF-1–Tg mice. Since IGF-1–Tg mice are protected against injury 
in IRI (7), a similar reduction in IRS-1 and/or IRS-1–associated 
PI3K would argue against a pathophysiological role for these 
signaling changes. Importantly, IGF-1–Tg mice demonstrate 
not only reduced apoptosis after IRI (7) but also improved func￾tional recovery compared with NTg mice (LVDP, 72.6% ± 4.4% 
of baseline vs. 52.3% ± 2.3%; P < 0.002; Figure 4A). Interestingly, 
IRS-1–associated PI3K activity was increased in IGF-1–Tg hearts 
at baseline and showed a nonsignificant trend toward higher 
activity after ischemia/reperfusion (Figure 4B). IRS-1 protein 
levels were comparable in IGF-1–Tg and NTg mice (Figure 4C). 
Similarly, gene transfer of IGF-1 in NRCMs did not induce the 
IRS-1 degradation evident with acute IGF-1 treatment (data not 
shown). Thus, while Akt activation induces degradation of IRS-1 
and loss of Akt1 increases cardiac IRS-1, tonic expression of 
IGF-1 both in vitro and in vivo appears to escape this regula￾tion, leaving open the possibility that loss of PI3K contributes 
to increased injury in myr-Akt–Tg mice.
In vivo cardiac gene transfer of activated PI3K rescues function and 
reduces injury in myr-Akt–Tg hearts after IRI. To test the functional 
significance of reduced IRS-1–associated PI3K activity, we per￾formed in vivo cardiac gene transfer with Ad.BD110 (8), encod￾ing constitutively active PI3Kα (25), the isoform linked to IRS 
signaling. Three days after gene transfer, BD110 expression was 
evident by immunoblotting for the incorporated c-myc epitope 
in Ad.BD110-infected hearts but not in hearts infected with 
control virus (Figure 5A). Importantly, Ad.BD110 restored PI3K 
activity in myr-Akt–Tg mice to a level comparable to that in con￾trol mice after IRI (Figure 5B). After gene transfer, hearts were 
subjected to 30-minute global ischemia and 40-minute reperfu￾sion. As before, no functional recovery was seen in uninfected 
or control virus–infected myr-Akt–Tg mice (Figure 5, C and D).

In contrast, after Ad.BD110 infection, myr-Akt–Tg mice dem￾onstrated substantial functional recovery, achieving a maximal 
LVDP of 34.1% ± 2.0%, significantly better than that of uninfect￾ed myr-Akt–Tg but not quite as good as that of NTg mice (maxi￾mal LVDP, 41.8% ± 1.9%; Figure 5, C and D). Remarkably, tissue 
injury as indicated by CPK release was also dramatically reduced 
by Ad.BD110 gene transfer (Figure 5E). IRS-1 expression was not 
affected by Ad.BD110, which suggests that restoration of PI3K 
activity is responsible for the observed rescue despite persistently 
reduced IRS-1 levels (Figure 5F). MAPK signaling was not altered 
by Ad.BD110 (data not shown). Akt activity was increased in 
myr-Akt–Tg compared with NTg mice but did not increase fur￾ther after Ad.BD110 gene transfer, which likely reflects satura￾tion of this signaling pathway in myr-Akt–Tg mice (Figure 5G). 
Interestingly, BD110 did increase phosphorylation (inhibi￾tion) of endogenous glycogen synthase kinase–3β (GSK3β) 
(Figure 5G). Although baseline GSK3β phosphorylation

in myr-Akt–Tg hearts is comparable to that in NTg hearts (20), 
the increase in GSK3β phosphorylation normally seen after IRI 
was not observed in myr-Akt–Tg hearts, which reflects the inhibi￾tion of IRS/PI3K signaling (Figure 5G). After restoration of PI3K 
activity, GSK3β phosphorylation is increased in the absence of 
further enhanced Akt activation. Thus, GSK3β phosphorylation 
occurs in IRI via IRS/PI3K-dependent signaling, and BD110 
restores GSK3β phosphorylation through PI3K-dependent but 
Akt-independent pathways. Of note, GSK3β inhibition with 
LiCl and the specific inhibitor SB216763 did not restore func￾tion to myr-Akt–Tg hearts during IRI (Supplemental Figure 4). 
Thus, acute GSK3β inhibition is not sufficient to restore car￾dioprotection, which possibly reflects the involvement of other 
pathways or a requirement for longer-term inhibition.
SGK1 phosphorylation is inhibited in myr-Akt–Tg hearts. SGK1 is 
phosphorylated and activated by PI3K and promotes cardio￾myocyte survival in vitro (19). Phosphorylation of SGK1 was 
decreased in myr-Akt–Tg hearts (Figure 6), which confirms 
impaired Akt-independent PI3K signaling.
IRS-1 expression is reduced in failing human hearts. To investigate 
whether a similar loss of IRS-1 occurs in human heart failure, 
we examined samples from nondiabetic, failing human hearts or 
unused donor hearts as controls. As previously reported (11), Akt 
activity was increased in heart failure samples (Figure 7A). Intrigu￾ingly, IRS-1 protein was significantly decreased in failing hearts 
compared with controls, with relative preservation of comigrating 
phospho-Akt-substrate (Figure 7B).
Discussion
Here we show that chronic Akt activation has detrimental effects 
after IRI due to feedback inhibition of IRS/PI3K signaling. This 
mechanistic connection is demonstrated by the rescue of func￾tion and reduced injury seen after restoration of PI3K signaling. 
Moreover, while the primary defect appears to be a reduction in 
IRS protein levels, these rescue experiments suggest the adverse 
consequences observed in the heart arise from the inability to 
activate PI3K. These data also demonstrate that PI3K-dependent 
but Akt-independent pathways are crucial for full cardioprotec￾tion and suggest a mechanism by which chronic Akt activation 
may become maladaptive.
Although our myr-Akt–Tg mice undoubtedly represent a par￾ticularly dramatic example of Akt-driven feedback inhibition of 
IRS/PI3K signaling, several observations suggest that these find￾ings have broader physiological relevance. First, IRS-1 levels were 
increased in Akt1-null mice, which suggests that Akt is a physi￾ological regulator of IRS-1. Second, activation of endogenous

Akt in cardiomyocytes by stimulation with insulin or IGF-1 
also led to a decrease in IRS-1 in vitro. Finally, cardiac samples 
from patients with heart failure in which Akt is activated (11) 
also demonstrated a reduction in IRS-1. Moreover, these data 
are consistent with evidence that cardiac IRS-1 is decreased in 
type 2 diabetes (26, 27), which possibly represents a response to 
chronic hyperinsulinemia and contributes to the development of 
insulin resistance in this setting. Prior studies in other systems 
have also demonstrated that serine or threonine phosphoryla￾tion of IRS-1 mediated by a variety of kinases including inhibi￾tor of kB kinase (IKK) (28, 29), PKC (30, 31), JNK (32), p70S6 
kinase (33), and Akt (21) can inhibit PI3K activation through 
either reduced IRS-1/PI3K association or degradation. The cur￾rent study extends these observations by demonstrating that 
Akt-driven feedback inhibition of IRS/PI3K signaling occurs in 
cardiomyocytes and that it has dramatic adverse consequences 
during IRI. We also found that mRNA levels of IRS-1 and IRS-2 
were reduced in myr-Akt–Tg hearts, which is consistent with 
prior reports indicating that insulin signaling can inhibit IRS-2 
transcription through an insulin response element (IRE) (34, 35). 
A similar IRE exists in the IRS1 gene (36), although its function￾al role has not been demonstrated. In IRS-1–null mice, IRS-2 
functions as an accessory adaptor molecule mediating activa￾tion of PI3K (13). In contrast, IRS-2 is also reduced with chronic 
Akt activation, which thereby precludes this potential compen￾satory mechanism. Thus, feedback inhibition of IRS/PI3K sig￾naling occurs through multiple mechanisms and likely reflects 
a physiological regulatory role of Akt. These findings may have 
relevance for a variety of conditions in which Akt is chronically 
activated in the heart, including heart failure. In addition, these 
studies have implications for genetic or other therapies targeted 
at Akt activation and suggest that long-term activation of this 
pathway would eventually have adverse consequences.
The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and its target, 
p70S6 kinase, represent an important effector pathway down￾stream of IRS/PI3K and are activated in myr-Akt–Tg mice 
(20). Moreover, mTOR activation of p70S6 kinase can mediate 
feedback inhibition of IRS/PI3K signaling (33). Of note, while 
the PI3K inhibitor wortmannin completely prevented insulin￾induced loss of IRS-1 in cardiomyocytes, rapamycin only mod￾estly inhibited IRS-1 loss (Supplemental Figure 5). Moreover, 
rapamycin did not restore functional recovery to myr-Akt–Tg 
hearts (n = 4; data not shown). Together these data suggest that 
PI3K/Akt mediates the effects we observe largely independently 
of mTOR/p70S6 kinase. Nevertheless, in the current study, we 
have not identified the IRS-1 phosphorylation site nor demon￾strated a direct physical interaction between IRS-1 and Akt, and 
thus Akt may modulate IRS-1 indirectly.
How do we reconcile these data with numerous studies docu￾menting the benefits of acute Akt activation? We propose the fol￾lowing model. Since the degree of feedback inhibition observed 
acutely is relatively modest, acute Akt activation confers a net car￾dioprotective benefit. However, with chronic (or perhaps repeti￾tive) Akt activation, the feedback inhibition of IRS/PI3K becomes 
more severe. The dramatically increased injury seen in myr-Akt–Tg 
mice after IRI demonstrates that Akt activation alone is not suf￾ficient for cardioprotection in the face of PI3K inhibition. PI3K￾mediated rescue demonstrates that the hypertrophy seen in myr￾Akt–Tg does not account for the increased injury and supports 
the importance of PI3K-dependent but Akt-independent cardio￾protective pathways (Figure 8). Thus we hypothesize that multiple 
pathways (Akt dependent and independent) are each necessary 
for full cardioprotection. Consistent with this model, dn-Akt and 
Akt1-null hearts exhibited impaired functional recovery after IRI 
(maximum LVDP, 16.5% and 14.2% in Akt+/– and Akt–/–, respec￾tively; n = 2 each). Our studies suggest that the increase in IRS-1 
levels seen in these mice (modest in Akt+/– and more marked in 
Akt–/–) was offset by the loss of cardioprotective Akt1 signaling. 
We hypothesize that as additional pathways are identified, inhi￾bition of each would compromise recovery in IRI but no single 
pathway would be sufficient for full cardioprotection.
Interestingly, the X-linked TG20 line has demonstrated acute 
cardioprotection in vivo (20). This line, which expresses less of

the myr-Akt transgene, exhibits a significant but less marked 
reduction in the level of IRS-1, which is further attenuated in chi￾meric hearts of female mice (Figure 2D). Thus, we would expect 
TG20 mice to manifest fewer adverse consequences of chronic 
Akt activation. In addition, as previously reported, transcript 
profiling revealed dramatic upregulation (675-fold by QRT￾PCR) of mRNA for OTT in TG20 but not TG564 hearts (37). 
OTT is an X-chromosome–encoded gene previously described 
only in ovary and testis that is likely upregulated by a positional 
effect of transgene insertion (37). While it is impossible to fully 
predict the biological effects of this artifact, it has prompted us 
to focus current efforts primarily on the TG564 line. Finally, 
a variety of important differences between the in vivo and the 
ex vivo ischemia/reperfusion models could also contribute to 
the different observations. These include the relative prevalence 
of different forms of cell death, as well as systemic influences 
from vascular tone, neurohumoral input, and the presence of 
circulating hematopoietic cells. Of note, inhibition of leukocyte 
recruitment attenuates IRI in vivo (38, 39) but has no bearing ex 
vivo. Since Akt1 activates eNOS (40, 41), NO-mediated inhibi￾tion of leukocyte adhesion may mitigate IRI (42) in vivo despite 
a moderate reduction in the level of IRS-1 in the TG20 line. To 
better understand intrinsic mechanisms controlling cardiomyo￾cyte survival, we have focused the current investigation on the 
isolated heart model.
The observation that BD110 increased GSK3β phosphorylation 
without an increase in Akt activation raises the possibility that these 
pathways may also phosphorylate GSK3β, previously proposed to 
act as a central integrator of survival signaling (43, 44). For example, 
SGK1 is a PI3K-dependent serine-threonine kinase that can phos￾phorylate GSK3β and promote survival in cardiomyocytes (19). 
Decreased SGK1 phosphorylation in myr-Akt–Tg hearts provides 
evidence for impaired Akt-independent PI3K signaling but does not 
establish a functional role for SGK1 in this context. Although, as 
previously reported, GSK3β inhibition improved functional recov￾ery in WT hearts (43, 45), it did not rescue function in myr-Akt–Tg 
hearts (Supplemental Figure 4). This may reflect involvement of 
other pathways or a requirement for longer-term inhibition.
The current study is consistent with prior work demonstrat￾ing that PI3K plays a cardioprotective role in settings such as 
preconditioning (46). However, acute inhibition of PI3K with 
wortmannin did not adversely affect recovery in normal hearts 
(46). Consistent with this, we found that wortmannin did not 
affect functional recovery after IRI (n = 6; P = 0.7 vs. NTg). At 
this dose (100 nM), wortmannin completely abrogated Akt 
phosphorylation but only partially and inconsistently inhibited 
phosphorylation of GSK3β (Supplemental Figure 6). At a higher 
dose (200 nM), inhibition of GSK3β phosphorylation was more 
consistent and functional recovery impaired, but instability in 
baseline cardiac function precluded quantitative analysis of 
recovery. Thus, wortmannin may incompletely inhibit the Akt￾independent targets of PI3K that continue to mediate GSK3β
phosphorylation. Perhaps even more important, PI3K inhibi￾tion in myr-Akt–Tg is chronic, and the duration of inhibition 
likely affects the response to IRI.
Although IRS-1 expression was reduced by insulin or IGF-1 
stimulation in vitro, as well as Akt activation in vivo, IRS-1 was 
preserved and associated with higher baseline PI3K activation in 
IGF-1–Tg mice. The protection seen in these mice (7) in contrast 
to the increased injury in myr-Akt–Tg is consistent with the model 
that Akt activation is not sufficient for cardioprotection and 
that PI3K-dependent but Akt-independent signaling plays a crit￾ical role in the response to IRI. However, it is not clear why there 
is no feedback inhibition of IRS-1/PI3K signaling in IGF-1–Tg 
mice. The potential roles of the level and kinetics of IGF-1 
expression remain to be explored, but these results are consis￾tent with adenoviral overexpression studies in cardiomyocytes 
(data not shown), which also demonstrated paradoxical pres￾ervation of IRS-1 protein (in contrast to IGF-1–treated cells). 
Whatever the mechanism, these findings may have important 
practical implications for consideration of therapeutic strate￾gies and may underlie our previously unexplained observation 
that IGF-1 overexpression achieves more effective protection of 
cardiomyocytes than expression of recombinant protein, even 
when matched for IGF-1 media levels (47).
Intriguingly, we also observed a reduction in IRS-1 levels in 
hearts from patients with heart failure. While considerably more 
and larger samples will be necessary for complete analysis and cor￾relation with Akt activation, we hypothesize that reduced IRS-1 
expression represents a feedback mechanism in response to chron￾ic and repetitive stimulation of this signaling pathway by the com￾plex array of cytokines and growth factors increased in heart fail￾ure (48, 49), many of which are capable of activating IRS/PI3K/Akt 
signaling. We would anticipate that loss of IRS-1 would produce 
a relative defect in downstream signaling akin to the insulin resis￾tance seen in type 2 diabetes. A similar blunted response was seen 
in myr-Akt–Tg hearts during IRI (Supplemental Figure 2). How￾ever, in heart failure, in contrast to our mouse model, activation of 
both Akt and PI3K likely would be increased because of increased 
stimulation by circulating factors. Reduced IRS-1 levels would 
blunt the response to these factors, and PI3K/Akt activation would 
be less than that of comparably stimulated normal hearts.
In summary, here we show that chronic Akt activation in the 
heart has adverse effects on cardiac injury and functional recovery 
after IRI through feedback inhibition of upstream signaling path￾ways. These findings demonstrate that Akt activation alone is not 
sufficient for cardioprotection and that PI3K-dependent but Akt￾independent pathways play a critical role in this setting. Future 
Figure 8
Schematic representation of Akt-mediated feedback inhibition. Akt￾induced phosphorylation of IRS proteins may lead to their dissociation 
from PI3K as well as proteasome-dependent degradation. Simultane￾ously, IRS transcription is inhibited (data not shown), which further 
reduces IRS levels. Consequently, activation of PI3K is impaired. Loss 
of signaling via PI3K-dependent but Akt-independent survival path￾ways can lead to increased injury despite persistent Akt activation.

studies will need to be directed at defining the nature and contri￾bution of such pathways to a variety of cardiac pathologies.
Methods
Animals. The cardiac-specific myr-Akt–Tg mice have been described pre￾viously (20). The TG564 line was used for these studies unless otherwise 
indicated. TG564 mice were backcrossed to C57BL/6 mice for more than 
10 generations. dn-Akt–Tg mice were generated analogously through 
oocyte injection using a cDNA encoding hemagglutinin-tagged dn-Akt 
(T308A, S473A) (50) under the direction of α–MHC promoter (51). Posi￾tive founders were bred to WT C57BL/6 mice for 5 generations. Because 
initial transgene expression was relatively low, hemizygous dn-Akt–Tg 
mice were crossbred, and mice carrying 2 transgene alleles were selected by 
quantitative PCR and confirmed by breeding to WT C57BL/6. An overall 
increase in immunoreactive Akt protein was confirmed in dn-Akt hearts 
(Supplemental Figure 3). In homozygous dn-Akt mice, cardiac Akt activity 
and, more modestly, phospho-GSK3β levels were reduced at baseline. Akt 
kinase activity increased after insulin stimulation, though less than in con￾trols, and these mice were used for the studies described. The IGF-1–Tg (2) 
and Akt1-null mice (23) have been described previously. Ten- to 15-week￾old age-matched mice were used in all experiments, and either littermates 
or WT mice from lines with at least 5 WT backcrosses (C57BL/6 for myr￾Akt and dn-Akt mice and FVB/N for IGF-1 mice) were used as NTg con￾trols. All protocols were approved by the Subcommittee on Research Ani￾mal Care at Massachusetts General Hospital.
Langendorff model. Mice were heparinized (1,000 IU/kg, i.p.) and anesthe￾tized (pentobarbital, 60 mg/kg, i.p.) and hearts excised and immersed in ice￾cold perfusion buffer. Aortae were cannulated and retrograde-perfused at a 
constant pressure (80 mmHg) with modified Krebs-Henseleit buffer (11 mM 
glucose, 118 mM NaCl, 4.7 mM KCl, 2.0 mM CaCl2, 1.2 mM MgSO4, 1.2 mM 
KH2PO4, 25 mM NaHCO3, 0.5 mM EDTA, equilibrated with 95% O2/5% 
CO2 at a pH of 7.4) at 37°C. A water-filled balloon catheter was introduced 
into the LV for recording of pressure and heart rate (PowerLab; ADInstru￾ments). The balloon was inflated until a stable LVEDP less than 10 mmHg 
was obtained. The temperature was maintained at 37°C with a water jacket. 
We monitored coronary flow rate by collecting coronary sinus effluent. No 
difference in contractile performance was seen between male and female 
mice, so data from both sexes were combined in all studies.
Ischemia/reperfusion model. For the control samples, hearts were aerobically 
perfused for 20 minutes. Where indicated, 100 nM insulin was added to 
the buffer, and hearts were perfused for another 10 minutes. For ischemia/
reperfusion, flow was eliminated for the period indicated after a 20-min￾ute control perfusion period. Hearts were then reperfused for 40 minutes. 
Some hearts were treated with either 10 mM LiCl or 3 µM SB21676 (Sigma￾Aldrich) for 10 minutes before ischemia and during the entire 40-minute 
reperfusion. Where indicated, wortmannin (Sigma-Aldrich) was added. 
Subsequently, hearts were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at 
–80°C prior to analysis. For infarct size, triphenyltetrazolium chloride 
(TTC) staining was performed as described previously (10).
In vivo cardiac function. In vivo hemodynamic analyses were performed by 
pressure-volume catheterization as described previously (52).
In vivo gene transfer. Recombinant adenovirus (20 µl at 1 × 109 particles/ml) 
encoding myc-tagged BD110 (8) or GFP–β-galactosidase was injected into 
the LV cavity during occlusion of the descending aorta at a body tempera￾ture of 18–21°C, as described previously (52). Three days later, hearts were 
isolated and subjected to ischemia/reperfusion as described above.
CPK. CPK was measured in the effluent using an enzymatic activity assay 
developed by the Biochemistry Laboratories at Massachusetts General and 
Johns Hopkins Hospitals. Values were corrected for coronary flow and 
heart weight [CPK (U/l) × coronary flow (l/min)/heart wt (g) = U/min/g].
DNA fragmentation. Apoptosis was assessed by DNA fragmentation as 
described previously (8). The density of the ladder was quantified using NIH 
Image version 1.63 (http://rsb.info.nih.gov/nih-image/download.html).
Kinase assays. For PI3K, 700 µg of total protein was immunoprecipitated 
with either anti–IRS-1, anti-p110α (Upstate), anti-p110β, or anti-p110γ
antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.), and kinase activity was detect￾ed by the appearance of radiolabeled 32P-labeled phosphatidylinositol 
3-phosphate ([32P]PI-3-P) after TLC as described (8). Autoradiographic 
signals were quantitated using NIH Image version 1.63. Where indicated, 
PI3K activity was determined by immunoprecipitation with anti-p110α
antibody and a fluorescence polarization assay according to the manufac￾turer’s instructions (Echelon Biosciences Inc.). We determined polarization 
by measuring the amount of unbound fluorescent probe with a VICTOR3 
plate reader (PerkinElmer). Values were normalized to the samples from 
NTg mice exposed to ischemia/reperfusion. For Akt, the Akt Kinase Assay 
Kit (Cell Signaling Technology) was used as described previously (20).
Immunoblotting. Immunoblotting was performed as previously 
described (20) using primary antibodies to IRS-1, p85, phospho-SGK1, 
SGK1, c-myc (Upstate), phospho-(Ser/Thr) Akt substrate, phospho-Akt 
(Ser473), Akt, phospho-GSK3β (Ser9) (Cell Signaling Technology), GSK3 
(Transduction Laboratories), β-actin (Sigma-Aldrich), and GAPDH 
(Abcam Ltd.). Signal was detected using enhanced chemiluminescence, 
and band intensity was quantified using NIH Image.
Immunoprecipitation. Seven hundred micrograms of total protein from 
either tissue or cardiomyocytes were immunoprecipitated for 30 min￾utes using anti–IRS-1 antibody. Subsequently, Protein A Sepharose beads 
(Amersham Biosciences) were added for 16 hours. Beads were washed 3 
times and proteins solubilized in 2× SDS sample buffer with boiling fol￾lowed by immunoblotting using the indicated antibodies.
Detection of proteasomal degradation in vitro. NRCMs were prepared and 
cultured for 72 hours as described previously (8), prior to incubation in 
serum-free RPMI1640 for 8 hours before infection with the indicated 
vectors. After 20 hours, the proteasome inhibitor ALLN (Calbiochem) or 
the structural control, ALLM (final concentrations, 50 µM), or DMSO 
alone was added (24). Where indicated, 100 nM wortmannin or 50 nM 
rapamycin (Sigma-Aldrich) was added. After 30 minutes, insulin (100 nM) 
was administrated as indicated. After 20 hours, cell lysates were 
immunoblotted for IRS-1.
Detection of IRS-1 phosphorylation. NRCMs were cotransfected with Ad.IRS-1 
and the indicated adenoviral vectors. After 48 hours, cell lysates were 
immunoprecipitated with anti–IRS-1 antibody or control Ig and then 
immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies.
Adenoviral vectors. Ad.GFP and Ad.BD110 have been described previ￾ously (8). Ad.BD110 encodes myc-tagged BD110, which encodes the 
PI3K p110α catalytic domain linked to the p85 regulatory subunit bind￾ing domain (25), and an independent GFP expression cassette (8). Both 
Ad.myr-Akt and Ad.dn-Akt encode separate expression cassettes for 
the Akt construct and GFP and were constructed by subcloning either 
myr-Akt or dn-Akt (T308A, S473A; Akt-AA) cDNAs into pAdTrackCMV 
(Stratagene) and obtaining homologous recombinants through cotrans￾formation with pAdEasy1 (Stratagene) in E. coli BJ5183 (Stratagene) cells 
as described previously (53). Ad.IRS-1 was kindly provided by K. Ueki 
(University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan).
QRT-PCR analysis. Total RNA was isolated and QRT-PCR performed 
using the Mx4000 system (Stratagene) as described previously (37). 
Transcriptional levels were determined using the ∆∆Ct method with 
normalization to GAPDH.
Human heart samples. Under a Human Studies Protocol approved by the 
institutional review board, heart failure samples were obtained from cardiac 
explants from transplant patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy.

Control samples came from unused donor hearts without evidence of car￾diac disease. To avoid confounding related to insulin signaling, no samples 
from diabetic patients were utilized in either group.
Statistical analysis. Data are represented as the mean ± SEM from at least 3 
independent experiments. Student’s t test was used to compare the means of 
normally distributed continuous variables. ANOVA followed by Newman￾Keuls post-hoc test for multiple comparisons was used for PI3K assays and 
in vitro immunoblotting for IRS-1. Two-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni 
multiple comparison correction was used for ex vivo LVDP profiles. P < 0.05 
was considered statistically significant.
