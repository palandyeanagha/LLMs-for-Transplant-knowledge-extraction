Treatment of light chain deposition disease with
bortezomib and dexamethasone
Light chain deposition disease (LCDD) is a rare plasma
cell dyscrasia characterized by deposition of
immunoglobulin fragments. The kidneys are almost
always affected while heart, liver and other tissues are
occasionally involved. About 50% of patients with
LCDD have concurrent myeloma, however most present
with nephrotic range proteinuria and rapidly deteriorat￾ing renal function.1 Renal biopsy shows nodular
glomerulosclerosis, resembling diabetic kidney changes,
and linear deposits of monoclonal light chains along
tubular basement membrane by immunofluorescence.
The depositions are granular or amorphous and non-fib￾rilar, Congo-red negative.2 The outcome of patients with
LCDD is variable. Median time to end-stage renal dis￾ease (ESRD) is 2.7 years with 5-year ESRD-free survival
of 37%.2 There is no standard treatment for patients
with LCDD. Chemotherapy with alkylating agents and
steroids has shown modest results.3,4 High-dose melpha￾lan (HDM) with autologous stem cell transplantation
(ASCT) has been used in some patients and has led to
improvement of renal function.5,6 Bortezomib, a
reversible proteasome inhibitor, has shown significant
activity in myeloma patients and is safely administered
to patients with renal failure, even those under dialysis.7
Preliminary experience indicates that bortezomib is
associated with hematologic and organ responses in
patients with light chain amyloidosis.8 Recent data indi￾cate that this agent may have a protective role of renal
parenchyma due to inhibition of NFκB activity.9 Based
on the above data we administered the combination of
bortezomib and dexamethasone to 4 consecutive
patients with LCDD with typical findings of renal biop￾sy, serum and urine electrophoresis, and immunofixa￾tion and bone marrow biopsy (Table 1). None of the
patients had symptomatic myeloma defined by osteolyt￾ic bone disease, hypercalcemia, anemia or renal impair￾ment due to myeloma cast nephropathy. Two patients
were previously untreated; one was relapsing from prior
response to cyclophosphamide with prednisone and one
was refractory to vincristine, doxorubicin and dexam￾ethasone (VAD). All patients presented with impaired
renal function, non-selective proteinuria and poorly con￾trolled hypertension, defined as blood pressure (BP) >
140/90 mmHg, although they were receiving three or
more antihypertensive drugs (Table 1). One patient also
had echocardiographic evidence of heart involvement.
Serum free light chains (FLCs-FREELITE assay) were ele￾vated in all patients, with abnormal kappa to λ ratio, and
were measured at the beginning of each cycle of treat￾ment. Three patients had no measurable monoclonal

protein by electrophoresis and FLCs were used to assess
hematologic response. All patients received the combi￾nation of bortezomib (B) 1.3 mg/m2 on days 1,4,8,11
and dexamethasone(D) 40 mg on days 1-4 every 21
days for up to 6 cycles. Patients provided informed con￾sent for the compassionate use of bortezomib. The hos￾pital’s review board granted permission to review and
report data from the files of the patients. Hematologic
responses to BD were rapid and 2 patients achieved a
CR, with a normal FLC ratio while the other 2 had
>50% decrease of the involved light chain. Table 1
shows details of the hematologic response, reduction of
proteinuria and improvement of renal function. After
BD all patients achieved adequate control of hyperten￾sion, defined as BP <120/80 mmHg, with less than half
of the drugs that they were using before treatment. The
toxicity of the combination was manageable. Because of
peripheral neuropathy, the dose of bortezomib was
reduced to 1 mg/m2 and to 0.7 mg/m2 in 2 patients
respectively and one patient received 5 cycles of BD.
Other side effects included mild and transient orthosta￾tic hypotension, transient elevation of liver enzymes
and constipation. Three patients subsequently proceed￾ed to HDM with ASCT: 2 patients while in CR after BD
and one in PR. Two were mobilized with cyclophos￾phamide and G-CSF and one with G-CSF alone. The
dose of melphalan was 140 mg/m2 based on creatinine
clearance prior to HDM. There were no complications
related to stem cell harvest and engraftment (Table 1).
After HDM, all 3 patients are in hematologic CR with
only trace proteinuria. 
The patient with heart involvement showed improve￾ment of his diastolic dysfunction and minor improve￾ment in the thickness of intreventricular septum by
1mm. After a follow-up of 10-18 months, all patients
are alive but in the patient who was not candidate for
HDM, proteinuria recurred two months after he
stopped VD, although criteria for hematologic relapse
were not yet fulfilled. 
This is the first report of the use of bortezomib in the
treatment of LCDD. Despite the small number of our
patients we provide evidence that BD is active in this
rare disease. Rapid reduction of toxic light chains is
mandatory in LCDD since continuing deposition may
rapidly deteriorate organ function.3 With BD, hemato￾logic responses were rapid and were accompanied by
rapid and significant reduction of proteinuria and by
improvement of renal function. As is also the case in
patients with amyloidosis, the measurement of serum
free light chains was useful in the follow-up of our
patients with LCDD and the reduction of involved light
chains was associated with a significant improvement in
proteinuria. 
The rapid reduction of toxic light chains after treat￾ment with BD resulted in the improvement of renal
function, however pre-clinical data indicate that there
may be additional mechanisms for the beneficial effect
of BD in LCDD. In LCDD, toxic monoclonal light chains
interact with receptors in mesangial cells initiating a
cascade of activation of pathways that include the NFκB
pathway. NFκB activation results in stimulation of
cytokine production causing attraction of inflammatory
cells. PDGF-β and TGF-β are also induced by light
chain–mesangial cell interaction in LCDD. This results
in cell proliferation and activation of genes responsible
for collagen and tenascin production, resulting in dra￾matic changes in mesangial matrix, leading to the
pathological picture of glomerulosclerosis.10 Bortezomib
inhibits the NFkB pathway,11 decreases TGF-β1 levels
and may down-regulate collagen and TIMP-1 produc￾tion.12,13 Thus, bortezomib may interrupt the cascade
that leads to rapid renal deterioration through these
pathways by inhibiting progression of glomerulosclero￾sis, and may improve glomerular function thus reducing
proteinuria. Nevertheless, demonstration of a borte￾zomib effect on the inflammation in renal parenchyma
would have required repeated renal biopsies which
were not performed. 
HDM with ASCT has been used in small series of
patients with LCDD and has resulted in durable
responses and improvement of renal function.5,6
However in patients with impaired renal function this
procedure is associated with increased mortality and
significant toxicity. In all our patients who underwent
HDM, toxicity was acceptable. We conclude that BD
appears to be an active combination that results in rapid
hematologic responses, rapid decrease of proteinuria
and improvement of renal function in patients with
LCDD. If others confirm our data, BD may become the
preferred initial treatment for patients with LCDD.

HLA-identical umbilical cord blood transplantation
from a sibling donor in juvenile myelomonocytic
leukemia
As recently described by Flotho et al. juvenile
myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) is a rare type of child￾hood leukemia not only characterized by young age,
hepatosplenomegaly, thrombocytopenia and monocyto￾sis, but also by molecular aberrations in the RAS-RAF￾MEK-ERK signaling pathway and GM-CSF-hypersensi￾tivity.
1 Although progress has been made in unraveling
the molecular background of JMML, the only curative
treatment option for these children is stem cell trans￾plantation (SCT).2,3 Previous studies have shown that in
JMML the graft versus leukemia (GvL) effect of the SCT
plays an important role in the prevention of relapse.2,4
Hence, donor and stem cell source selection could play
an important role in the outcome of JMML patients. SCT
using unrelated, immunological naive, umbilical cord
blood (UCB) has shown to be effective for pediatric
JMML.3 UCBT has increased the available pool of
hematopoietic stem cell transplantation donors, espe￾cially for young children.5 This is important for patients
with rare HLA-haplotypes and with diseases that may
rapidly progress like JMML. However, it is conceivable
that the relatively immunological naivety of cord blood
stem cells from a newborn HLA identical sibling donor
may be a negative factor for outcome.4,6
In this report we describe 5 JMML patients registered
in the database of the European Working Group on
Childhood MDS (EWOG-MDS), who have received
umbilical cord stem cells from an HLA-identical sibling
(Table 1). So far only MacMillan et al. has described a
JMML patient who received HLA-identical sibling umbil￾ical cord cells.7 More information is available on unrelat￾ed UCBT in JMML.3,7,8 Recently, from the combined
EWOG-MDS/EBMT registry, Locatelli et al. described
100 JMML patients of whom 7 received an unrelated
UCBT. These 7 patients showed a delayed hematologic
recovery, but the outcome was comparable to the chil￾dren treated with other stem cell sources.3 Rocha et al.
reported that children receiving a related UCBT for
malignancies, bone marrow failure syndromes, hemo￾globinopathies, inborn errors of metabolism or immun￾odeficiencies, had a slower hematopoietic recovery and
a lower risk of acute and chronic GVHD than children
receiving a related bone marrow transplantation.9
Gluckman et al. have shown that the amount of acute
GVHD in related UCBT is lower (18%) than in unrelat￾ed UCBT (32%).10 These studies underscore the relative
immune naivety of the UCB cells and the feasibility of
the use of UCBs especially for childhood transplantation
settings. However, especially in JMML, where the GvL￾effect is an important contributor to the success of the
transplantation procedure, it could be questioned
whether these relatively naive umbilical stem cells from
sibling donors should be used in all patients, especially
when alternative donors would be available.
In all cases full donor-chimerism was found after
transplantation. In the cases that relapsed, a mixed
chimerism was found prior to clinical progression. In
addition, in Patient 1 increasing mixed donor-chimerism
developed from day 42 onwards without clinical signs of
relapse (Figure 1). Mixed donor-chimerism after SCT in
JMML has been shown to be an important predictor for
relapse, therefore discontinuation of immunosuppres￾sive therapy (IST) is the first step to prevent relapse if
this occurs early after transplantation.11 To avoid relapse,
a second stem cell transplantation was considered, but
the parents were very reluctant to proceed, because of
the absence of any clinical signs of JMML and the excel￾lent clinical condition of the child. Therefore, 6-mercap￾topurine (6-MP) (average dose 40 mg/m2
) was started on
day 145 after SCT. When, after initial improvement,
donor-chimerism increased, 6-MP was replaced by 13-
cis-retinoic acid (100 mg/m2
/day every other week) for
2.5 years until the age of five years. Thereafter, the child
remained well with a current follow-up of five years
after SCT. At present the percentage of donor cells is
15%, without any clinical sign of JMML. At the moment
no series are available on the use of 6-MP and 13-cis￾retinoic acid in a relapse setting after SCT for JMML.
Although Locatelli et al. showed that second SCT was
successful in 7/15 cases with a relapse after SCT, the
issue whether to proceed to a second SCT in all cases of
