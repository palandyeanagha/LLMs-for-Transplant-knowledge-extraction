Abstract
Background: Alcoholic hepatitis (AH) has a severe prognosis due to hepatic inflammatory injury. The cytokine interleukin-22
(IL-22) is reported to exert anti-apoptotic and proliferative effects, but IL-22 has not been studied during the course of AH.
IL-22 is mainly produced by CD4+ (helper) T cells, including Th17 cells. In addition, Th17 cells produce the proinflammatory
cytokine IL-17A, which has been implicated in AH.
Aims: We aimed to study the levels of circulating IL-22- and IL-17A-producing T helper cells and plasma cytokines in
patients with AH and to examine the observations in relation to the short-term disease course.
Methods: We collected blood samples from 21 consecutive patients with severe AH on days 0, 14 and 30 after diagnosis,
and included 10 stable alcoholic cirrhosis patients and 10 healthy subjects as controls. Analyses were performed using flow
cytometry and ELISA.
Results: We found higher frequencies of IL-22-producing T helper cells in AH patients (median 1.7%) than in cirrhosis
patients (1.0%, p = 0.03) and healthy controls (1.0%, p = 0.01), and a 1.5-fold increase in the plasma concentration of IL-17A in
AH compared with healthy controls (p,0.01). Those patients who markedly improved their Glasgow Alcoholic Hepatitis
Score demonstrated a 2-fold higher frequency of IL-22-producing T helper cells at baseline and during follow-up than
patients whose condition deteriorated (p = 0.04).
Conclusions: The frequency of IL-22-producing T helper cells was increased in AH patients and most so in those whose
condition seemed to improve. T cell differentiation toward an IL-22-producing phenotype may thus be favourable in AH.

Introduction
Alcoholic hepatitis (AH) has an increasing incidence and is the
most dangerous type of alcoholic liver disease with a six-month
mortality of up to 40% [1,2]. The mortality has not been possible
to reduce convincingly over time, as there has been no break￾through in the understanding of the immunopathology underlying
the disease that can be utilized as a basis for new therapeutic
interventions.
The initial innate immune response leading to alcoholic
hepatitis may be triggered by alcohol locally in the liver and via
the increased intestinal translocation of LPS, which activates
hepatic Kupffer cells and recruits dysfunctional neutrophils
[3,4,5]. The background of the severe disease prognosis probably
is that this response is dysregulated and results in a florid activation
of the adaptive immune system in the liver causing further
inflammatory injury [6,7]. Still, few studies address the in￾volvement of the adaptive immune system in AH; however, recent
reports support a possible hepato-protective and -regenerative role
of the cytokine interleukin-22 (IL-22) [8]. T helper (Th) cells are
the main source of IL-22, and the subsets Th1, Th17 and Th22
are responsible for its production [9,10,11,12]. IL-22 is a member
of the IL-10 superfamily and signals via receptors on non￾hematopoietic cells, such as hepatocytes [13,14]. Receptor
engagement induces anti-apoptosis and proliferation of target cells
[8,15,16]. IL-22 reduces alcohol-induced liver injury in mice and
increases the hepatic expression of IL-22 receptors in patients with
AH [17]. To the opposite effect, a high number of cells, which
produce the potent proinflammatory, neutrophil-recruiting cyto￾kine IL-17, are reported in liver biopsies from patients with AH
[18]. Because the Th17 cells produce both cytokines, this subset is
of obvious interest in the study of the role and interrelationship of
these possibly mutually counteractive cytokines. The differentia￾PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 January 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 1 | e55101

tion of Th17 cells depends on several cytokines, including IL-21
and IL-23 [19,20]. Taken together, these reports suggest the
Th17-related cytokines as targets for immunological studies in AH,
where the temporal changes in Th17-related cytokines or their
relation to measures of clinical outcome have not been examined.
On this background, the present study was designed to gain new
insights into the dynamics of the Th17-related cytokines IL-17A
and IL-22 during the course of severe AH. We hypothesized that
T helper cells producing IL-22, IL-17A and IL-21 as well as the
plasma cytokine levels will be elevated in AH. We, furthermore,
examined whether there may be an association between high
frequencies of IL-22-producing T helper cells and disease
improvement, and, conversely, between high frequencies of IL￾17A-producing T helper cells and disease deterioration.
Materials and Methods
Ethics Statement
All of the participants provided written informed consent, and
The Central Denmark Region Committee on Biomedical Re￾search Ethics approved the study (j.no. 20100281).
Patients
A total of 21 consecutive patients were included in the study
when they were diagnosed with severe AH according to the
following criteria: a history of excessive alcohol ingestion until at
least three weeks before admission; acute jaundice (serum bilirubin
.80 mmol/l); a modified Maddrey’s discriminant function .32;
the absence of infectious foci; and the absence of liver tumours or
other cancers [21]. Patients were excluded from the study if they
developed clinical or microbiological evidence of infection (positive
chest radiographs or routine cultures of urine, blood, sputum and
ascites). Other exclusion criteria included an age below 18 years or
above 75 years, gastrointestinal bleeding within the past 3 months
or any prior immune-modulating therapy. The clinical outcome
measure of the AH patients was a change in the Glasgow Alcoholic
Hepatitis Score (GAHS). A reduction in the score of $2 was
defined as a clinical improvement. The baseline characteristics
including the measurements of disease activity were not different
between the two groups of AH patients (Table 1). Baseline blood
samples were collected at the time of admission before the
initiation of treatment. The patients were treated with 400 mg
pentoxifylline TID. To elucidate whether our results are related to
the effects of the severe hepatic inflammation in AH or an effect of
long-term alcohol exposure, we included patients with stable
alcoholic cirrhosis as sick controls (n = 10). Additionally, age- and
sex-matched healthy volunteers with no history of liver or other
diseases were included as healthy controls (n = 10). All patients and
controls were abstinent from alcohol for at least one week
preceding the investigation.
Flow Cytometry
Culture and stimulation. Flow cytometry was performed on
peripheral blood mononuclear cells that were isolated by Ficoll￾Hypaque centrifugation (GE Healthcare Bio-sciences, Uppsala,
Sweden) and stored at 2140uC until analysis. The samples from
each patient were collectively analysed. For the flow cytometric
analysis, the cells were thawed and washed (PBS solution
containing 20% heat-inactivated pooled human serum-AB). Next,
the cells (2610‘6/ml) were cultured in a flat-bottomed 6-well plate
(Nunc, Denmark) for 4 hours at 37uC and 5% CO2 in culture
medium (RPMI 1640 supplemented with 100 U/ml penicillin,
100 mg/ml streptomycin and 10% heat-inactivated pooled human
serum-AB). The stimulation during culture consisted of 50 mg/ml
phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) (Sigma-Aldrich, Den￾mark), 1 mg/ml ionomycin (Sigma-Aldrich) and 10 mg/ml of the
golgi-blocking agent brefeldin A (Sigma-Aldrich) per 2.5 ml cell
suspension.
Staining. The cultured cells were harvested, washed twice in
wash buffer (PBS with 2% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 0.9%
azide) and adjusted to a concentration of 5610‘6 cells/ml. The cell
suspension (100 ml) was incubated with optimized amounts of
fluorescent-conjugated antibodies against surface markers
(CD45RO-FITC and CD4-PerCp, BD Bioscience, San Diego,
CA) for 20 minutes at room temperature in the dark. Following
the surface staining, the cells were washed and treated with 1.5 ml
of BD FACS lysing solution (diluted 1:10 in deionized water
according to the manufacturer’s instructions, BD Bioscience),
followed by permeabilisation (FACS Permeabilising Solution 2
diluted 1:10 in deionized water according to the manufacturer’s
instructions, BD Bioscience). Next, the cells were blocked with
heat-inactivated murine serum (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK) and
subsequently stained with fluorescent-conjugated antibodies that
were directed against intracellular cytokines (IL-17A-Alexa Flour
647, IL-21-PE; eBioscience, San Diego, CA, and IL-22-PE; R&D
systems, Minneapolis, MN) along with isotype controls. The
isotype controls were matched by IgG subtype, concentration,
species and fluorochrome. Following 20 minutes of incubation at
room temperature in the dark, the cells were washed twice and
fixated (250 ml PBS with 1% formaldehyde). The samples were
analysed within 24 hours of preparation using a FACS Canto II
instrument (BD Bioscience).
Gating. Based on a forward side scatter plot, a lymphocyte
gate was inserted and 100,000 events were recorded within the
gate. A plot of forward scatter height versus amplitude was used to
exclude events without a single cell appearance. The lymphocytes
were further identified based on their expression of CD4 (T helper
cell) and CD45RO (activated/memory cells). FMOs (fluorescence
minus one) were used to correct for data spread effects due to
compensation and isotypes were used to assess unspecific binding
of antibodies. We report the frequency of cytokine positive cells
within the CD4+
CD45RO+ population and their median fluores￾cence intensity (MFI).
ELISA
Plasma was simultaneously collected with the samples for flow
cytometry and stored at 280uC until use. The plasma concentra￾tions of IL-17A, IL-21, IL-22 and IL-23 (p19/p40) were measured
with ELISA kits (eBioscience) according to a previous study [22].
The samples and standards were analysed in duplicate, and the
average optical density, minus the average value of the blanks, was
used to calculate the concentration of a given sample based on the
standard curve. The lower detection limit was determined as the
value of the average of the blanks plus 2 standard deviations,
which resulted in cut-off values of 2.72 pg/ml (IL-17A), 7.36 pg/
ml (IL-21), 9.04 pg/ml (IL-22) and 8.40 (Il-23) pg/ml. The values
below the detection limit were assigned the cut-off value.
Statistical Analyses
We used the Kruskal-Wallis test and the Wilcoxon rank-sum
test to examine the baseline differences among the groups (AH,
alcoholic cirrhosis and healthy controls). In the AH patients, an
ANOVA for repeated measurements was performed for a com￾parison of the cell and cytokine levels over time. These levels were
normally distributed after a logarithmic transformation and were
included in the analyses. Histograms and Q–Q plots were used to
check normality, and Levene’s test was used to test the
homogeneity of variance. The results are expressed as the median

and interquartile range (25–75). A two-tailed p-value of ,0.05 was
considered statistically significant.
Results
Distinct CD4+
CD45RO+ T cells were Responsible for the
Production of IL-17A, IL-21 and IL-22
Th17 cells are reported to co-express IL-17A, IL-21 and IL-22
[23]. Therefore, we concomitantly stained for these cytokines to
determine whether Th17 cells producing all three cytokines were
present in the circulation of AH patients. We observed that the
majority of cytokine-producing cells were detected inside the
lymphocyte gate (data not shown). The cytokine-producing cells
were, however, predominantly single positive for one of the
cytokines (Figure 1); therefore, we evaluated the cytokine-positive
cell populations separately throughout the study.
Elevated Frequency of IL-22-producing CD4+
CD45RO+ T
cells in AH
We measured the percentages of CD4+
CD45RO+ T cells that
produced IL-22 in the peripheral blood at baseline and detected
a 1.7-fold increase in the frequency of these cells in AH patients
compared with both alcoholic cirrhosis patients and healthy
controls. This increase was significant (Figure 2). The average
amount of IL-22 produced per CD4+
CD45RO+ T cells was not
different between the groups as the populations MFI did not differ
(data not shown). During follow-up after 2 and 4 weeks of
treatment, the frequencies of IL-22-producing CD4+CD45RO+ T
cells remained unchanged (Figure 3, Table 2). Having shown an
increased number of IL-22-producing CD4+
CD45RO+ T cells in
active AH, we progressed to examine if this was reflected in IL-22
plasma levels. However, plasma concentrations of IL-22 were not
different among the groups (Table 2).
High Frequency of IL-22-producing CD4+
CD45RO+ T cells
in Patients whose Condition Improved
To examine the relationship between IL-22-producing
CD4+
CD45RO+ T cells and the course of AH, we divided the
patients into two groups based on who experienced a short-term
clinical improvement, which was defined as a decline in the GAHS
$2 (n = 8), and who did not (n = 13). The patients whose condition
improved exhibited approximately 2-fold higher frequencies of IL￾22-producing CD4+
CD45RO+ T cells on the day of diagnosis.
This difference increased during the follow-up period, being most
pronounced at 2 weeks with a 4-fold enrichment compared with
the patients whose condition did not improve (p,0.05, Figure 4).
Increased Plasma Concentration of IL-17A in AH Patients
In all of the study groups, we detected IL-17A-producing
CD4+
CD45RO+ T cells, but without difference in the frequencies
of these cells among the groups. Nevertheless, the plasma
concentration of IL-17A was 1.5-fold higher in the AH patients
than in the healthy controls (p,0.01, Table 2); but a similar
concentration was detected in the cirrhosis patients. The
frequencies of IL-17A-producing CD4+
CD45RO+ T cells and
plasma IL-17A did not fluctuate during follow-up (Figure 3) and
were not associated with changes in the GAHS (data not shown).
IL-21 and IL-23 are not Elevated or Associated with the
Course of Severe AH
We also measured IL-21-producing CD4+
CD45RO+ T cells
and the cytokines IL-21 and IL-23 in plasma, as they are involved

The frequency of IL-21-producing CD4+
CD45RO+ T cells was
not increased, and, similarly, the plasma concentrations of IL-21
and IL-23 did not differ among the groups. We did not observe
any temporal differences in IL-21-producing CD4+
CD45RO+ T
cells or plasma IL-21 during follow-up or any association with
GAHS improvement.
Discussion
The results of the study did, indeed, provide new insights into
the dynamics of the Th17-related cytokines during the course of
severe AH: This study is the first to demonstrate high frequencies
of IL-22-producing CD4+
CD45RO+ T cells in patients with AH.
In addition, our results may suggest a protective role of IL-22,
because those patients whose condition improved exhibited
consistently elevated frequencies of these cells. However, in
disagreement with the second possibility we examined, our results
seem to indicate that the proinflammatory IL-17A-producing
CD4+
CD45RO+ T cells, although present in AH, did not play
a decisive part for the course of the disease.
Our study involved relatively few patients in whom a large
number of measurements were conducted, and the results are not
definitive or exhaustive. Nonetheless, some of the findings were
quite consistent and quantitatively clear-cut. Our results, there￾fore, may be considered as an initial test of concept regarding the
involvement of the Th17-related cytokines in the pathogenesis of
AH, and we believe that our findings are of sufficient clarity to
warrant further studies along the same line.

To date, there have been few studies on IL-22 in human liver
disease. Elevations of T cells that produce IL-22 have been detected
in patients with acute HBV at levels similar to those we observe in
AH [24]. Additionally, IL-22-positive cells are found in HCV
patients in both peripheral blood and liver tissue as well as in patients
with hepatocellular carcinoma [25,26]. Such point-studies can not
be directly compared with our results but if confirmed would suggest
that the IL-22 involvement may be a general feature of hepatic
inflammation. In viral hepatitis, IL-22 facilitates hepatocyte survival
according to observations in humans and IL-22 transgenic mice, and
anti-apoptotic actions are proposed as an explanation for its
upregulation in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma [16,26,27].
Regarding IL-17A, elevations have been detected in HBV, HCV,
autoimmune hepatitis and primary biliary cirrhosis in which an IL￾17A response is suggested to be disadvantageous [25,28,29,30]. In
human alcoholic liver disease, Lemmers et al. were the first to report
the activation of the IL-17-pathway [18].
In this study, the AH diagnosis was established using a combina￾tion of standard clinical and biochemical criteria in accordance with
several clinical trials [31,32,33]. All our AH patients were treated
with pentoxyfilline according to the local clinical guidelines [34].
This drug induces a moderate decline in the production of TNF-a.
However, the baseline samples were obtained prior to treatment and
all AH patients received the same treatment; we find it unlikely,
therefore, that the observed cell and cytokine differences between
the groups resulted from the treatment.
The purpose of our work could be adequately addressed by
means of cells from the blood, because the expression of IL-22
within the CD4+
CD45RO+ sub-profile was so pronounced that
the effects were clearly detectable in the periphery. Such blood￾based data do seem to reflect events within the liver; a similar
study on HCV patients found increased frequencies of IL-17A￾and IL-22-producing T cells in the peripheral blood and even
more so in the liver [25].
In this study, we report higher frequencies of circulating IL-22-
producing CD4+
CD45RO+ T cells in AH patients than in
alcoholic cirrhosis patients and healthy controls. The reported
functional effects of IL-22 are ambiguous and include context￾dependent proinflammatory or tissue-preserving actions [10].
Nevertheless, the association between the improvement of the

clinical disease course and the high frequency of IL-22-producing
CD4+
CD45RO+ T cells may be consistent with a beneficial role of
these cells in AH. This would accord with investigations on liver
inflammation in rodent models in which hepatic IL-22 mRNA,
protein and receptor expression are increased, and where the
blocking, knocking-out or neutralization of IL-22 accelerates the
inflammatory injury [8,16,35].
The possible hepato-protective effects of IL-22 producing cells
may not be exclusively related to alcohol-mediated inflammatory
injury, because IL-22 has been suggested to play a protective role
in both HBV, HCV and in models of acute liver failure [25,26,36].
The underlying mechanisms may be explained by in vitro studies of
HepG2 hepatocellular carcinoma cells that demonstrated an IL￾22-mediated induction of various anti-apoptotic and mitogenic
proteins [35]. In mice, these IL-22 mediated effects resulted in
amelioration of liver steatosis and fibrosis along with improved
liver regeneration after tissue injury [37,38,39].
Despite the upregulation of IL-22-producing CD4+
CD45RO+
T cells, we did not detect any change or difference in the plasma
IL-22 levels in either of our analyses. This could result from
sequestration of IL-22. In AH patients, hepatic IL-22 membrane￾associated receptors are increased, and furthermore a soluble
decoy receptor, IL-22-binding-protein, exists, which holds a higher
binding affinity than the functional membrane receptor [17,40].
LPS, usually highly elevated in AH, is known to increase the
expression of this decoy receptor [41].
In regards to the potent proinflammatory Th17 cytokine IL￾17A, we confirmed the presence of IL-17A in AH as shown by
Lemmers et al. [18]. We found a lower plasma level of IL-17A as
also others have done, and the difference may depend on the
ELISA assays [22,25]. We observed no change over time in the
cell frequencies or the plasma concentrations of IL-17A. This may
argue against a dominant role of IL-17A for the disease course of
AH, in agreement with our results on the cytokines, IL-21 and IL￾23, involved in Th17 cell differentiation. For IL-23, the majority of
the patients had undetectable levels, and levels of plasma IL-21
and IL-21-producing CD4+
CD45RO+ T cells were not increased
and did not correlate with disease markers in AH.
The current therapeutic strategy of prednisolone or pentoxifyl￾line is double-edged, because the beneficial anti-inflammatory
actions of these drugs are accompanied by increased susceptibility
to infections and inhibited liver regeneration [32,42]. In accor￾dance with the described biological roles of IL-22, the cytokine has
been suggested as an add-on treatment option that could
compensate for the adverse effects of the clinical immunomodu￾lators [43]. Our findings, although explorative of nature, may lend
support to such an approach, but first of all larger studies involving
hard clinical outcomes such as mortality and cirrhosis are needed.
In conclusion, we found increased frequencies of IL-22-pro￾ducing T helper cells in the patients with AH and most so in the
patients with clinical disease improvement. We suggest this to
support the emerging concept of IL-22 as a hepato-preserving
cytokine with a role in the course of AH.
