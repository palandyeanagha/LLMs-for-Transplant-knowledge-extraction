Abstract
Introduction: The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic and prognostic value of presepsin in patients
with severe sepsis and septic shock during the first week of ICU treatment.
Methods: In total, 116 patients with suspected severe sepsis or septic shock were included during the first 24 hours
of ICU treatment. Blood samples for biomarker measurements of presepsin, procalcitonin (PCT), interleukin 6 (IL-6),
C reactive protein (CRP) and white blood cells (WBC) were drawn at days 1, 3 and 8. All patients were followed up
for six months. Biomarkers were tested for diagnosis of sepsis, severe sepsis, septic shock and for prognosis of
30-days and 6-months all-cause mortality at days 1, 3 and 8. Diagnostic and prognostic utilities were tested by
determining diagnostic cutoff levels, goodness criteria, C-statistics and multivariable Cox regression models.
Results: Presepsin increased significantly from the lowest to most severe sepsis groups at days 1, 3 and 8 (test for
linear trend P <0.03). Presepsin levels revealed valuable diagnostic capacity to diagnose severe sepsis and septic
shock at days 1, 3 and 8 (range of diagnostic area under the curves (AUC) 0.72 to 0.84, P = 0.0001) compared to IL-6,
PCT, CRP and WBC. Goodness criteria for diagnosis of sepsis severity were analyzed (≥sepsis, cutoff = 530 pg/ml;
≥severe sepsis, cutoff = 600 pg/ml; ≥septic shock, cutoff = 700 pg/ml; P <0.03). Presepsin levels revealed significant
prognostic value for 30 days and 6 months all-cause mortality (presepsin: range of AUC 0.64 to 0.71, P <0.02).
Patients with presepsin levels of the 4th quartile were 5 to 7 times more likely to die after six months than patients
with lower levels. The prognostic value for all-cause mortality of presepsin was comparable to that of IL-6 and
better than that of PCT, CRP or WBC.
Conclusions: In patients with suspected severe sepsis and septic shock, presepsin reveals valuable diagnostic
capacity to differentiate sepsis severity compared to PCT, IL-6, CRP, WBC. Additionally, presepsin and IL-6 reveal
prognostic value with respect to 30 days and 6 months all-cause mortality throughout the first week of ICU
treatment.

Introduction
Severe sepsis and septic shock represent major chal￾lenges of modern intensive care medicine, and still
recently published international guidelines demand on￾going research about the pathophysiology, diagnostics
and treatment [1]. Worldwide at least 19 million people
are estimated to suffer from severe sepsis [2] and - if
ever - only half of these patients are treated according to
best standard of care even in the Western world [3].
Today, alert and earliest timing of diagnosis and treat￾ment is still recommended as the best method of choice
to prevent severe sepsis and septic shock. No single new
effective medical therapy or decisive diagnostic tool has
been found over the last decades [3]. Additionally, the
increasing number of patients surviving severe sepsis or
septic shock is endangered by an adverse long-term
prognosis and therefore these patients need to be in￾creasingly focused upon [1,3]. A broad range of clinical
and laboratory parameters are specifically combined and
define the diagnostic standard of severe sepsis and septic
shock [1]. However, there is a great lack of evidence for
biomarkers to reliably diagnose and predict the future
course of patients suffering from severe sepsis or septic
shock [4-6].
Soluble cluster of differentiation 14 subtype (sCD14-ST) -
so-called presepsin - is cleaved from the monocyte/macro￾phage-specific CD14 receptor complex after binding with
lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and LPS binding protein
(LPB) during systemic infections [7-10]. Presepsin ap￾pears to reveal significant diagnostic capacity to diag￾nose sepsis, severe sepsis and septic shock compared to
procalcitonin (PCT) in patients presenting to the emer￾gency department [11-14]. However, a comparative
evaluation of the diagnostic and prognostic implications
between presepsin and PCT, interleukin 6 (IL-6), white
blood cells (WBC) as well as C-reactive protein (CRP)
in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock being
treated on an internal ICU has rarely been investigated
within one single study. Therefore, this study aims to
comparatively evaluate the diagnostic, as well as short￾and long-term prognostic utility of presepsin in patients
with severe sepsis and septic shock during the first week
of intensive care treatment.
Materials and methods
Study patients, design and data collection
The Mannheim Sepsis Study (MaSep, clinicaltrials.gov iden￾tifier: NCT01535534) was conducted as a mono-centric
prospective controlled study at the University Medical
Centre Mannheim (UMM), Germany. Patient enrolment
started in October 2011. The study was carried out accord￾ing to the principles of the declaration of Helsinki and was
approved by the medical ethics commission II of the Fac￾ulty of Medicine Mannheim, University of Heidelberg,
Germany. Informed consent was obtained from all partici￾pating patients or their legal representatives.
The study was designed to reflect a representative co￾hort of patients with a minimum age of 18 years, who
had proven criteria of severe sepsis or septic shock,
found at a typical internal ICU. Main exclusion criteria
were any traumatic or postoperative cause of sepsis de￾velopment (that is, poly-trauma, cerebral trauma, critical
postoperative status, or burns). Diagnosis of systemic in￾flammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and of sepsis se￾verity was based on established criteria [15,16]: when
patients revealed a microbiologically or clinically proven
infection, they were assigned to the sepsis group. Pa￾tients were categorized to the severe sepsis group if they
developed at least one of the following newly developed,
sepsis-induced organ failures: acute encephalopathy, pul￾monary organ failure defined as the ratio of the partial
pressure of oxygen (PaO2) to the fraction of inspired
oxygen (FiO2) PaO2/FiO2 < 250, renal organ failure with
urine output <0.5 ml/kg/h, hematological organ failure
with platelet count <100,000/mm3 or unexplained meta￾bolic acidosis with pH <7.3 and lactate levels >1.5 times
the upper limit of normal. Sepsis-induced organ failures
in these patients were strongly connected to infection
and were present for less than 24 h. Patients developing
cardiovascular organ failure with need for vasopressors
longer than 1 h were categorized as suffering from septic
shock. Disease severity on the ICU was documented by
the acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II
(APACHE II) and the sequential organ failure assess￾ment (SOFA) score [17,18].
All patient data, such as creatinine levels, hemoglobin,
hematocrit, WBC count, platelet count, CRP, bilirubin,
sodium, potassium, urea, IL-6, PCT, body temperature,
respiratory rate, heart rate, blood pressure, partial pres￾sure of O2 and CO2, bicarbonate, base excess, lactate,
pH value, Glasgow coma scale (GCS) were documented.
Additionally, prior medical history, age, sex, body weight
and the germ spectrum were documented.
After the end of each hospital treatment, two study
physicians independently reviewed all available clinical
data of the study patients and classified all patients into
four disease groups: SIRS, sepsis, severe sepsis or septic
shock. The study physicians were blinded to the results
of tested biomarker measurements, such as presepsin,
PCT and IL-6.
Blood samples for presepsin measurements were taken
within 24 h after clinical onset of severe sepsis or septic
shock on the ICU (day 1) as well as on day 3 and 8 of
ICU treatment. All patients were followed up until
30 days and 6 months after study inclusion by direct
telephone visits with the patients or their general practi￾tioners. The main prognostic outcome was all-cause
mortality after 30 days and 6 months: 60 people without

any clinically proven systemic infection served as a con￾trol group.
Biomarker measurements
Blood samples were obtained by venipuncture into serum
and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) monovettes®
(SARSTEDT AG & Co.; Nümbrecht, Germany). Within
30 minutes all blood samples were centrifuged at 1,000 × g
at 4°C for 15 minutes. Serum/plasma was separated, frozen
and stored at −80°C.
Presepsin measurements were performed with the
PATHFAST® immunoassay analytical system (PROGEN
Biotechnik GmbH, Germany; Mitsubishi Chemical
Medience Corporation, Japan) using plasma from EDTA
monovettes® [8,19]. IL-6 and PCT were measured in
serum. IL-6 was measured with reagents from Roche
Diagnostics (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) and
PCT was measured with reagents from Thermo Fisher
Scientific (Thermo Fisher Scientific Clinical Diagnostics,
BRAHMS GmbH, Henningsdorf, Germany). The assays
were performed on a Cobas e601 twin module (Roche
Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany). IL-6 and PCT mea￾surements were performed at the central laboratory in
Nuremberg, Germany.
Statistical analysis
For normally distributed data, the Student t-test was ap￾plied. Otherwise, the Mann–Whitney U-test was used as
a nonparametric test. Deviations from a Gaussian distri￾bution were tested by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.
Spearman’s rank correlation for nonparametric data was
used to test the association of presepsin blood levels
with medical parameters. Qualitative parameters were
analyzed by use of a 2 × 2 contingency table and Chi2
test or Fisher’s exact test as appropriate. Quantitative
data are presented as mean ± standard error of mean
(SEM) or as median and interquartile ranges (25th to
75th percentiles), depending on the distribution of the
data. For qualitative parameters absolute and relative fre￾quencies are presented. A test for linear trend was ap￾plied to compare the biomarker levels in the different
groups of sepsis severity. Post-hoc statistical power ana￾lyses were performed. All analyses were exploratory and
utilized a P-value of 0.05 (two-tailed) for significance.
Diagnostic value of biomarkers
For C-statistics: receiver-operating characteristic (ROC)
curve analyses were performed with calculation of area
under the curve (AUC) for diagnosis of sepsis, severe
sepsis and septic shock during the first week of ICU
treatment at days 1, 3 and 8. A minimal AUC was set at
0.75 to define valuable discriminative diagnostic cap￾acity of any biomarker. Accordingly, diagnostic good￾ness criteria (that is, accuracy, specificity, sensitivity,
negative/positive predictive values (NPV/PPV), and rela￾tive risk) of the biomarkers were calculated. Accuracy was
defined as the sum of true positives plus true negatives
divided by all measured patients. Diagnostic AUCs were
compared by the method of Hanley et al. [20].
Prognostic value of biomarkers
For C-statistics: ROC analysis with calculation of the
AUC was performed for prognosis of all-cause mortality
in all patients after 30 days and 6 months for all
biomarkers (that is presepsin, IL-6, PCT, CRP, WBC),
APACHE II and SOFA score. Prognostic AUCs were
compared by the method of Hanley et al. [20]. Log￾transformed biomarker concentrations over time (days 1,
3, 8) in survivors and non-survivors were analyzed by
two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) to estimate the
effects of the two factors, time and survival, on biomarker
levels. Kaplan-Meier survival curves according to presep￾sin quartiles were created and the corresponding hazard
ratios (HR) were calculated for each quartile. Cox regres￾sion analysis was performed to adjust the prognostic value
of presepsin and IL-6 with age, sex, creatinine, APACHE
II and SOFA score and the number of ICU treatment
days, all representing confounding factors on presepsin
levels and objective clinical factors limiting prognosis of
patients with severe sepsis and septic shock. HR are
indicated for a log unit-change of presepsin or IL-6.
The calculations were performed with InStat and
StatMate (GraphPad Software), SPSS software (SPSS
Software GmbH), and SAS version, release 9.2 (SAS
Institute Inc. Cary, NC, USA).
Results
Baseline characteristics are given in Table 1. A total of 116
patients have been included into the MaSep study: 24% of
the patients (n = 28) suffered from severe sepsis and 64% of
the patients (n = 74) suffered from septic shock at the time
of study entry. There were 12% of the patients classified to
the sepsis (n = 5) or SIRS group (n = 9). In SIRS patients
either no evidence of any infection was finally found or
organ dysfunction was mainly caused by concomitant, man￾ifested chronic pulmonary or acute neurological diseases.
Mean APACHE II score at day 1 was highest in patients
with septic shock (mean ± SEM = 27 ± 1). The most com￾mon primary site of infection was the lung in at least 50%
of patients in each group, followed by abdominal and
urinary tract infections (up to 16% of patients).
Associations of presepsin with clinical and laboratory
parameters
Presepsin levels were significantly correlated with clin￾ical and laboratory parameters at day 1. As shown
in Table 2, presepsin correlated with creatinine levels
(r = 0.28, P = 0.002) as well as with the days of renal

replacement therapy (RRT) during ICU treatment (r =
0.36, P = 0.0001). Additionally, presepsin correlated with
WBC, CRP, PCT, IL-6 and bilirubin. Interestingly, pre￾sepsin was also significantly correlated with the number
of days of intensive care treatment, mechanical ventila￾tion and catecholamine therapy (P <0.05). Presepsin
levels were not correlated with patients’ age and gender
in this cohort (P >0.05) (data not shown).

Diagnostic value of presepsin
Figure 1 illustrates distribution of presepsin, IL-6 and
PCT levels according to the different groups of sepsis se￾verity at days 1, 3 and 8. A significant increasing trend
of presepsin levels was observed compared to controls
in the lowest to highest groups of sepsis severity during
the first week of intensive care treatment (P ≤0.03),
which was not observed for PCT or IL-6 (P >0.05).
Presepsin levels (pg/ml) were as follows (that is, me￾dian (IQR)): day 1: SIRS 393 (249 to 745), sepsis 362
(249 to 745), severe sepsis 947 (523 to 2,486), septic
shock 2,330 (1,181 to 5,219); day 3: SIRS 448 (350 to
844), sepsis 651 (523 to 1,430), severe sepsis 1,479 (787
to 3,811), septic shock 2,060 (954 to 4,114); day 8: SIRS
604 (223 to 965), sepsis 1,528 (573 to 4,539), severe sep￾sis 1,556 (859 to 2,462), septic shock 3,041 (1,757 to
5,407); and controls 216 (146 to 350).
The diagnostic value of presepsin levels to diagnose
septic shock (AUC = 0.80) was comparable to that of IL￾6 (AUC = 0.86) and PCT (AUC = 0.83) at day 1 of ICU
treatment (AUC differences, P >0.05) (Table 3). At day 3
of ICU treatment, the diagnostic value of presepsin
(AUC = 0.84) to diagnose at least sepsis was significantly
better than that of PCT (AUC = 0.69) (AUC difference,
P = 0.05) and comparable to that of IL-6 (AUC = 0.81)
(AUC difference, P >0.05). Interestingly, presepsin (AUC =
0.80) levels still revealed valuable diagnostic capacity to
diagnose at least severe sepsis when compared to IL-6
(AUC = 0.71) and PCT (AUC = 0.66) at day 3. However,
presepsin was not able to differentiate septic shock at day 3
(AUC = 0.72; that is, <0.75 predefined AUC margin),
whereas the AUC of IL-6 was 0.76 at day 3. At day 8 of
ICU treatment, the diagnostic value of presepsin was
evident for all different groups of sepsis severity (for
example, diagnosis of at least sepsis, presepsin AUC =
0.82), whereas IL-6, PCT, WBC and CRP did not ex￾ceed an AUC ≥0.75 (Table 3).
Accordingly, presepsin revealed valuable diagnostic
goodness criteria at defined cutoff levels (≥sepsis =
530 pg/ml; ≥ severe sepsis = 600 pg/ml; ≥ septic shock =
700 pg/ml) with a minimum sensitivity of 89% to diag￾nose either patients with at least sepsis, severe sepsis or
septic shock at all points in time (Table 4). At day 1, pa￾tients with presepsin levels ≥700 pg/ml were up to nine
times more likely (that is, relative risk) to suffer from
septic shock than patients with lower levels. Specificity
was 77%, PPV 74% and the NPV was 92%, thereby
reaching a diagnostic test accuracy of 82% (Table 4). At
day 3, PPV’s for presepsin levels were at least 82% corre￾sponding to a low number of patients diagnosed false
positive. In contrast, at day 8 NPVs for presepsin levels
were at least 81%, corresponding to a low number of pa￾tients diagnosed false negative (Table 4).
Prognostic value of presepsin
All-cause mortality rates were 50% after 30 days (58/
116) and 62% after 6 months (72/116). Six months of
follow up were completed in all patients. Presepsin levels
were significantly higher in patients who died by 30 days
or 6 months compared to those who survived (P =
0.008).
The prognostic AUCs of presepsin were statistically
significant at all time points and for all-cause mortality
at 30 days and at 6 months (Table 5). AUCs of presepsin
were numerically greater compared to the AUCs of IL-6
(with the exception of day 1 for prediction of 30-day
mortality, presepsin AUC = 0.64), however AUCs for
presepsin and IL-6 did not differ significantly (P >0.05)
(Table 5). APACHE II and SOFA scores were the only
further significant prognostic indicators of 30-day and 6-
month all-cause mortality, whereas these AUCs did not
differ significantly from those of presepsin (P >0.05).
Presepsin and IL-6 levels were significantly (P <0.001)
increased in non-survivors (30 days, n = 58; 6 months,
n = 72) compared to survivors (30 days, n = 58; 6 months,
n = 44) consistently at days 1, 3 and 8 of ICU treatment
(Figure 2). Presepsin levels of both survivors and non￾survivors did not change during the first week of ICU
treatment, whereas IL-6 levels decreased (P <0.001) both
in survivors and non-survivors (Figure 2). An interaction
of survival with time was not detected. Specifically,
presepsin levels were significantly higher (P = 0.02) in
patients who died from septic shock within 6 months
(presepsin median: 2,690 pg/ml, IQR 1,348 to 6,719 pg/ml,

n = 53) compared to those patients surviving septic shock
(presepsin median: 1,234 pg/ml, IQR 717 to 3,420 pg/ml,
n = 19), when measured at day 1 of ICU treatment (data
not shown).
Patients with the highest presepsin levels in the fourth
quartiles were up to 6.8 times more likely to die by 30 days,
and up to 5.5 times more likely to die by 6 months both
when measured at day 1 or day 8 of intensive care treat￾ment (Figure 3). After adjusting for age, sex, creatinine,
ICU days and APACHE II score (model 2), presepsin
levels measured at days 1 and 8 revealed significant
prognostic value for 30-day and 6-month all-cause mor￾tality (range of HR 1.8 to 7.5; P <0.03) (Table 6). Presep￾sin levels at day 3 were significantly associated with
an adverse outcome only in univariate Cox models. Not￾ably, IL-6 offered significant prognostic value for both
short- and long-term all-cause mortality at all time
points during ICU treatment (Table 6).
Despite replacing the APACHE II with the SOFA score
within Cox regression models to predict 30-day and
6-month all-cause mortality, presepsin retained its signifi￾cant prognostic value at days 1 and 8 of ICU treatment
(range of HR 1.9 to 11.7; at least P = 0.04). However, pre￾sepsin was not statistically significant in adjusted Cox
models at day 3 of ICU treatment. In contrast, IL-6 had
significant prognostic value at all time points of ICU treat￾ment and for both 30-day and 6-month all-cause mortality
(range of HR 1.8 to 8.5; P = 0.0001) (data not shown).

Discussion
The present study comparatively evaluated the diagnos￾tic as well as short- and long-term prognostic value of
sCD14-ST - that is - presepsin, with PCT, IL-6, CRP and
WBC in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock
during the first week of intensive care treatment at days
1, 3 and 8. To the best of our knowledge, the present
results are the first that are based on a stepwise and
detailed statistical approach with respect to the diagnos￾tic and prognostic capacity for each inflammatory bio￾marker, stage of sepsis severity and different time points
during ICU treatment.
First, it was demonstrated that measurements of pre￾sepsin levels had valuable and consistent diagnostic cap￾acity for the different stages of sepsis severity compared
to PCT, IL-6, CRP and WBC during the first week of

ICU treatment. Diagnostic cutoffs were set at ≥530 pg/ml
for ≥ sepsis, at ≥600 pg/ml for ≥ severe sepsis and ≥700 pg/
ml for septic shock reaching at least 89% sensitivity based
on a minimum AUC of at least 0.77. IL-6 only had discrim￾inative AUCs (that is, AUC >0.75) for diagnosis of septic
shock on day 1 and 3 and for sepsis at day 3. PCT, CRP
and WBC mostly failed to have any discriminative capacity
for the different groups of sepsis severity at the different
time points (AUCs <0.75).
In accordance with the presented results, Liu et al. pre￾viously demonstrated that presepsin levels had the best
diagnostic capacity for diagnosis of sepsis (AUC = 0.82),
severe sepsis (AUC = 0.84) and septic shock (AUC = 0.79)
compared to PCT (that is, severe sepsis AUC = 0.74; septic
shock AUC = 0.78) in 859 patients presenting at the emer￾gency department in Bejing, China [13], while cutoff levels
(that is, severe sepsis: presepsin cutoff = 449 pg/ml; septic
shock: presepsin cutoff = 550 pg/ml) with lower diagnostic
sensitivities (that is, severe sepsis 82%, septic shock 86%)
were calculated. Ulla et al. [14] evaluated 106 patients pre￾senting at the emergency department with SIRS, sepsis,
severe sepsis or septic shock, thereby revealing a lower
diagnostic value of presepsin for diagnosis of at least sepsis
compared to PCT (that is, diagnosis of ≥ sepsis: presepsin,
AUC = 0.70; PCT, AUC = 0.88), while the best diagnostic
cutoff of presepsin was 600 pg/ml accompanied by a lower
sensitivity of 79%.
In the present study we tried to avoid this inconsist￾ency by choosing optimal and uniform cutoff levels (sep￾sis 530 pg/ml, severe sepsis 600 pg/ml, septic shock
700 pg/ml) at a maximum achievable sensitivity on days
1, 3 and 8 (that is, at least 89%). This approach was
based on clinical considerations to capture as many pa￾tients as possible who were truly diseased. Interestingly,
within the present analysis presepsin levels had weak
diagnostic value for the differentiation of septic shock at
day 3 of ICU treatment. This might be explained by a
longer half-life of presepsin keeping higher concentra￾tions at least until day 3 of intensive care treatment,
which might also being influenced by the presence of
acute kidney injury (AKI) in patients with severe sepsis/
septic shock [12]. At day 8 of ICU treatment, presepsin

again revealed diagnostic discrimination for patients with
septic shock.
In contrast, Endo et al. [11,21] evaluated presepsin,
IL-6 and PCT levels in patients with proven bacterial in￾fections compared to patients with non-bacterial infec￾tions and found that all inflammatory biomarkers were
significantly higher in patients with bacterial infections.
Corresponding diagnostic AUCs for a proven bacterial
infection were highest for presepsin and PCT (that is,
presepsin, AUC = 0.908; PCT, AUC = 0.905) and lowest
for IL-6 (that is, IL-6, AUC = 0.825).
Recent trials mostly evaluated single measurements of
presepsin in patients presenting to the emergency de￾partment, trying to establish presepsin as an early one￾shot guiding biomarker for emergency care [13,14].
However, too little is yet known about presepsin mea￾surements during the course of severe sepsis or septic
shock after immediate admission to the ICU and follow￾ing intensive care treatment [22]. Accordingly, stepwise
diagnostic and prognostic evaluation of the individual
patient with severe sepsis is recommended as early as
possible during ICU treatment in order to establish real￾istic treatment goals and clinical decision-making [1].
The present study showed that presepsin levels have sev￾eral significant associations with different ICU parame￾ters reflecting the intensity and severity of severe sepsis/
septic shock within our cohort (for example, significant
correlations with APACHE II and SOFA score, days of
intensive care treatment, days of mechanical ventilation
and days of catecholamine treatment).
Accordingly, further influencing factors on presepsin
despite age and renal function are rarely known [12].
Notably, a significant correlation between presepsin and
bilirubin, as shown in the present study, has not been

described yet. While the liver represents a central organ
of metabolic and immunological homeostasis, liver dys￾function can facilitate the progression of multiple organ
failure in septic patients [3,23]. Extra-hepatic bacterial
infections within sepsis have been described to account
for almost 20% of jaundice cases, and increases of bili￾rubin themselves have been found recurrently in pa￾tients with sepsis [3,23]. A correlation between
presepsin and inflammatory biomarkers, such as CRP,
WBC, IL-6 and PCT, can be explained by the ongoing
systemic activation of inflammatory biomarkers during
severe sepsis and septic shock [3,24].
Second, it was demonstrated that measurements of
presepsin levels revealed valuable prognostic capacity
to predict short- and long-term (that is, 30-day and
6-month) all-cause mortality compared to PCT, CRP
and WBC consistently throughout days 1, 3 and 8 of
ICU treatment. Patients with presepsin levels of the
Figure 3 Kaplan-Meier survival curves evaluated by quartiles of presepsin after 30 days (left column) and 6 months (right column) of
follow up in the total study cohort (n = 116). Hazard ratios (HR) were calculated for each risk group according to presepsin quartiles measured
at day 1 (top) and day 8 (bottom).

fourth quartile were up to five to seven times more likely
to die after 6 months than patients with lower levels.
APACHE II and SOFA scores solely revealed acceptable
prognostic values for all-cause mortality. IL-6 was the
only inflammatory biomarker with comparable prognos￾tic value at all time points as demonstrated both in
C-statistics and within multivariable Cox regression models
being adjusted to age, sex, intensive care days and APACHE
II/SOFA score.
The prognostic value of presepsin in severe sepsis/sep￾tic shock has not yet been evaluated in detail. Presepsin
has been described as a powerful prognostic biomarker
compared to PCT and APACHE II scores for short-term
28-day all-cause mortality (presepsin, AUC = 0.66; PCT,
AUC = 0.68, APACHE II, AUC = 0.72) [11,13]. Ulla et al.
[14] demonstrated increased risk of death within 60 days
in patients with increased presepsin levels ≥1,000 pg/ml
[13,14]. In a retrospective analysis including patients
with severe sepsis and septic shock after discharge from
the ICU, Masson et al. demonstrated constantly increased
presepsin levels in decedents and revealed significant
prognostic value for both 28-day and 90-day all-cause
mortality, whereas PCT failed to provide any prognostic
information [22]. It was speculated that decreasing presep￾sin levels in surviving patients might indicate a beneficial
effect of ICU treatment. However, these studies did not in￾clude IL-6 measurements as another prognostic biomarker
next to presepsin.
Therefore, the present study delivered new evi￾dence about both presepsin and IL-6 as powerful
prognostic biomarkers of short- and long-term prog￾nosis in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock
[25-27]. Specifically long-term prognostic risk stratifi￾cation has become of major interest for patients with
severe sepsis and septic shock [14,22,28]. Patients
surviving severe sepsis/septic shock remain at in￾creased risk of death in the following months and
years after hospital discharge, while suffering from
chronically impaired physical or neurocognitive func￾tioning [3]. In this respect, measurements of presep￾sin and IL-6 during the first week of ICU treatment
might help to better prognosticate the individual
half-year course of these patients, specifically ad￾dressing the risk of all-cause mortality.

Limitations
The present study was performed on the internal ICU
at the University Medical Centre Mannheim, Germany. Pri￾marily, this study included patients with severe sepsis or
septic shock 24 h after admission to the medical ICU or
24 h after disease onset during ICU treatment. If statisti￾cally significant diagnostic and prognostic values for pre￾sepsin and IL-6 were calculated, sufficient statistical power
of at least 80% could have been presumed. If statistically
non-significant differences were calculated, a larger number
of study patients of at least 300 to 2,000 patients in each
group would have been required to guarantee sufficient
statistical power, for example, for the inflammatory bio￾markers PCT, CRP and WBC with respect to diagnosis or
prognosis. However, high P-values and relatively marginal
differences in these biomarker levels with regard to diag￾nostic and prognostic differentiation in the present study
cohort of 116 patients suggest that there might not be a real
clinically relevant difference. Within our study, we did not
find any significant associations of presepsin levels with age
and sex of the patients, which were previously described
[12]. Analyses were not blinded with respect to WBC and
CRP, because both biomarkers are used in daily routine
practice. Based on the presented results, a single or double
biomarker combination (for example, presepsin and IL-6)
for diagnostic and prognostic assessment appears to be use￾ful in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock being
treated on a medical ICU. Additional clinical tools, such as
risk-prediction scores (for example, APACHE II or SOFA
score) might add specific information when single non￾significant or negative biomarker results (for example, CRP,
WBC, PCT) are evident. However, combined biomarker
strategies for diagnostic and prognostic assessment need to
be investigated, both in larger, multi-center studies and in
prospective clinical studies, with internal medicine patients
as well as surgical or trauma patients.
Conclusions
Taken together, it has been demonstrated that measure￾ments of presepsin levels had independent diagnostic and
prognostic value in patients with severe sepsis and septic
shock during the first week of intensive care treatment.
Presepsin levels had valuable diagnostic value for the diag￾nosis of sepsis, severe sepsis and septic shock at days 1, 3
and 8 of ICU treatment compared to PCT, IL-6, CRP and
WBC. Additionally, presepsin levels had valuable prognos￾tic capacity to predict short- and long-term all-cause mor￾tality when compared to PCT, IL-6, CRP, WBC and
APACHE II score.
