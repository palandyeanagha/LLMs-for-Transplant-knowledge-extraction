Endothelial cells (ECs) are the critical cellular element responsible for postnatal angiogenesis. Since the cal￾cium channel blocker (CCB) nifedipine indirectly upregulates endothelial superoxide dismutase expression
by stimulating the production of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) from smooth muscle cells
(SMCs), we examined whether nifedipine would induce human coronary artery endothelial cell (HCEC) tube
formation via an increase in VEGF production from human coronary artery SMCs (HCSMCs) in an in vitro
model. Nifedipine stimulated VEGF production from HCSMCs, and this stimulation was abolished by protein
kinase C (PKC) inhibitors and a bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist. In addition, supernatant derived from
nifedipine-treated HCSMCs induced HCEC tube formation. This tube formation was inhibited by pretreat￾ment with a specific inhibitor of kinase insert domain-containing receptor/fetal liver kinase-1 (KDR/Flk-1)
tyrosine kinase and an inhibitor of nitric oxide (NO) synthase. In conclusion, nifedipine increases VEGF
secretion through PKC activation via the B2 receptor. The VEGF secretion directly induces HCEC tube for￾mation via the KDR/Flk-1/NO pathway. CCBs may thus have novel beneficial effects in improving coronary
microvascular blood flow in addition to their main effect of reducing blood pressure. (Hypertens Res 2005;

Introduction
Calcium channel blockers (CCB) are widely used for the
treatment of hypertension and coronary artery disease
because these drugs induce an effective vasodilation, includ￾ing in coronary arteries (1−3). CCB are believed to increase
coronary blood flow by inhibiting the entry of Ca2+ into
smooth muscle cells (SMCs) through specific L-type calcium
channel-blocking effects (4, 5). However, CCB may also
influence endothelial cells (ECs), which have not been shown
to possess L-type calcium channels (6, 7). In addition, Orth et
al. demonstrated that CCBs inhibited the proliferation of
mesangial cells, which also lack L-type calcium channels (8).
Thus, CCBs are thought to exert blood pressure-lowering
effects independent of L-type calcium channel blockade.
Since angiogenesis, the process of postnatal neovascular￾ization, is a critical component of several human diseases,

including ischemic heart disease, cancer, diabetic microvas￾cular disease, rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis, we focused
on the effect of the CCB nifedipine on angiogenesis. Angio￾genesis is believed to be mediated by the proliferation, migra￾tion, and remodeling of fully differentiated endothelial cells
(9, 10). Several lines of evidence support the putative role of
nifedipine in the modulation of angiogenesis; for example,
Fukuo et al. reported that nifedipine indirectly upregulates
endothelial superoxide dismutase (SOD) expression by stim￾ulating vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) produc￾tion from SMCs (11). In addition, nifedipine upregulates
SOD expression in SMC via nitric oxide (NO) production
from ECs (12). Increased NO production in ECs is important
for protecting organs against ischemic or hypertensive stress
(13). More recently, we reported that stimulation of the
bradykinin (BK) B2 receptor leads to the transactivation of
VEGF receptor kinase insert domain-containing receptor/
fetal liver kinase-1 (KDR/Flk-1) as well as to endothelial NO
synthase (eNOS) activation, which induces angiogenesis in
human coronary artery ECs (HCECs) (14). These reports
indicate that the precise role of nifedipine in angiogenesis is
likely to be complex, and that nifedipine may be critical to the
angiogenic process.
In the present study, using an in vitro model of HCEC tube
formation on a matrix gel, we showed that an increase in
VEGF production from nifedipine-treated human coronary
artery SMCs (HCSMCs) may be a potent signal for inducing
angiogenesis through the KDR/Flk-1/NO pathway in HCECs.
In addition, we showed that protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitors
and a B2 receptor antagonist could attenuate nifedipine￾induced angiogenesis.
Methods
Materials
The following antibodies and reagents were purchased:
VEGF and an inhibitor of NO synthase L-NAME (Nω-nitro-L￾arginine methyl ester hydrochloride) from Sigma (St. Louis,
USA); a specific inhibitor of KDR/Flk-1 tyrosine kinase (4-
[(4′-chloro-2′-fluoro)phenylaminol]-6,7-dimethoxy-quinazo￾line; Tki), inhibitors of PKC Go6850 (2-[1-(3-dimethylami￾nopropyl)-1H-indol-3-yl]-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)-maleimide) and
Go6980 (3-[1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-5-methoxyindol-3-
yl]-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)maleimide) from Calbiochem (La Jolla,
USA); and Hoe140 (D-arginyl-[Hyp3
,Thi5
,D-Tic7
,Oic8
]-BK
and BK from Peptide Institute Inc. (Osaka, Japan).
Cell Culture
HCSMCs and HCECs were purchased from Clontech (Palo
Alto, USA). SMCs and ECs were cultured in media supple￾mented with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin/strepto￾mycin, SMC growth supplement or endothelial cell growth
supplement (Takara Co., Osaka, Japan) at 37°C under 5%
CO2, and used after 3−5 passages. In the experiments, SMCs
and ECs cultured in the same manner but without cell growth
supplement were used as controls.
Cell Proliferation Assay
SMCs or ECs (1 × 103
 cells) were plated on a 96-well plate
and cultured under 5% serum conditions. After 48 h, the cells
were cultured for 18 h in the presence or absence of different
kinds of reagents in medium supplemented with 0.2% FBS
and without cell growth supplement at 37°C under 5% CO2.
The cells were stained with CellTiter 96 One Solution Reagent
(a novel tetrazolium compound [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-
5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazo￾lium, inner salt; MTS assay] (Promega, Madison, USA) for 4
h at 37°C under 5% CO2, and absorbance at 490 nm was
recorded with a 96-well plate reader.
Angiogenesis Assay on Matrigel
An angiogenesis assay on Matrigel was performed as
described previously (14, 15). Briefly, the matrix gels
(Chemicon International, Inc., Temecula, USA) were allowed
to polymerize in the plate. ECs (1 × 103 cells) were seeded and
grown on Matrigel for 18 h in a humidified 37°C, 5% CO2
incubator. In experiments, ECs were grown with the superna￾tants from SMCs that had been treated with different kinds of
reagents in medium supplemented with 0.5% FBS and with￾out growth supplement. After washing, tube formation was
observed using a light microscope, and pictures were cap￾tured with a computer system. We performed a “pixel analy￾sis” of the tube formation area according to a procedure
described previously (14, 15).
Apoptosis Assay
SMCs or ECs (1 × 105
 cells) were cultured for 48 h in a 10-cm
dish containing 5% FBS. Then, the medium was exchanged
for medium containing nifedipine, 0.2% FBS, and no cell
growth supplement, and the cells were cultured an additional
18 h at 37°C under 5% CO2. Staining of cells with fluores￾cence-labeled annexin V (FITC-Annexin V) (MedSystems,
Burlingame, USA) was used as a functional index of early
apoptosis. The percentage of stained cells was analyzed quan￾titatively by flow cytometry.
Enzyme Immunoassay
Concentrations of VEGF in SMCs cultured and treated with
different kinds of reagents in medium supplemented with
0.5% FBS and without growth supplement for 18 h in a
humidified atmosphere at 37°C were determined as described
previously (16) in duplicate by specific enzyme immunoas￾says (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, USA) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.

Preparation of Protein Extract and Immunoblot￾ting
Untransfected or transfected SMCs were cultured in medium
containing 0.2% FBS in the presence or absence of different
kinds of reagents for 18 h at 37°C under 5% CO2. Cells were
then scraped. The procedure for cell lysis and Western blot
analysis of signaling proteins on Immobilon-P membranes
(Millipore Corp., Bedford, USA) has been described previ￾ously (17). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary
antibody and an enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amer￾sham, Buckinghamshire, UK) were used for detection, and
band intensity was quantified by digital image analysis.
Statistical Analysis
Data are shown as the mean±SD. Differences in individual
variables were analyzed by an unpaired t-test as appropriate.
A value of p<0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Data were analyzed using commercially available statistical
software (Statview-J 4.11; Abacus Concepts Inc., Berkeley,

Results
Culture Medium Derived from Nifedipine-Treated
HCSMCS Induced HCEC Tube Formation, and
This Effect Was Inhibited by Tki and L-NAME
We first analyzed the ability of nifedipine to stimulate and
stabilize tube formation, with ECs cultured on Matrigel. Since
the clinical plasma concentration of nifedipine is about 0.2
μmol/l (18), the concentration of nifedipine used in the exper￾iments was from 0.1 to 5 μmol/l. As shown in Fig. 1, we
examined whether a cell culture medium derived from nife￾dipine-treated or untreated SMCs could stimulate EC tube
formation. The medium derived from nifedipine-treated
SMCs dose-dependently led to the formation of a capillary￾like structure on the Matrigel surface. We optimized the dose
for the maximum dose required to induce tube formation in
experiments, in which the dose-response showed that the
maximum effective dose of nifedipine was 2 μmol/l. When 2
μmol/l of nifedipine was indirectly incubated with ECs on a
Matrigel surface for 18 h, tube formation was not observed
(data not shown). To analyze the mechanism responsible for
this finding, we analyzed whether nifedipine-induced tube

formation in ECs was blocked by Tki and L-NAME. Nife￾dipine (2 μmol/l)-induced tube formation was blocked by Tki
and L-NAME, suggesting that the supernatant derived from
nifedipine-treated SMCs stimulated EC tube formation
through the KDR/Flk-1/NO pathway.
Nifedipine at up to 2 µmol/l Did Not Affect Cell
Proliferation in HCSMCs or HCECs
To analyze another possible mechanism by which nifedipine
might stimulate cell proliferation, we analyzed whether nife￾dipine induced the proliferation of HCSMCs and HCECs
(Fig. 2a). Although nifedipine at up to 2 μmol/l did not affect
the proliferation of HCSMCs or HCECs, at 5 μmol/l it signif￾icantly inhibited the proliferation of both HCSMCs and
HCECs.
Nifedipine Time- and Dose-Dependently Induced
VEGF Secretion from HCSMCs
Since nifedipine-induced tube formation was blocked by Tki,
we examined whether nifedipine increased the release of
VEGF from HCSMCs. As shown in Fig. 2b and c, nifedipine
induced a significant increase in the release of VEGF from
HCSMCs: time- and concentration-dependent increases in
VEGF secretion were observed, and these increases were sig￾nificant from 8 h and 1 μmol/l, respectively. However, the
mRNA expression of VEGF isoforms as assessed by reverse
transcription−polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was not
increased by exposure to nifedipine for up to 18 h (data not
shown), suggesting that nifedipine regulated VEGF secretion
by some post-transcriptional mechanisms. When ECs were
incubated with 2 μmol/l of nifedipine for 18 h, VEGF secre￾tion was not observed in this cell system. Although the culture
medium derived from nifedipine (5 μmol/l)-treated SMCs
induced the greatest VEGF secretion, tube formation was
lower than that with medium treated with 2 μmol/l of nife￾dipine. We also measured the apoptotic effect under the same
conditions. Although CCB inhibited glomerular cell apopto￾sis (19), 10±3% of cells showed apoptosis in the presence of
a high concentration of nifedipine (5 μmol/l) in this study.
Therefore, 5 μmol/l of nifedipine blocked HCSMC prolifera￾tion accompanied by apoptosis. Tube formation caused by the
nifedipine (5 μmol/l)-induced increase in VEGF secretion
may be blocked by the anti-proliferative effect of nifedipine
(5 μmol/l) on HCSMCs and HCECs.
PKC Inhibitor Decreased Nifedipine-Induced
VEGF Secretion from HCSMCs
Since stretching and BK have been shown to increase VEGF
secretion through PKC activation (20, 21), we next examined
whether nifedipine induces VEGF secretion through a PKC
pathway (Fig. 3). We preincubated cells for 1 h with the selec￾tive PKC inhibitors Go6983 and Go6850. These inhibitors
blocked nifedipine (2 μmol/l)-induced VEGF secretion from
HCSMCs.
B2 Receptor Antagonist Blocked Nifedipine￾Induced VEGF Secretion from HCSMCs
Since nifedipine induced VEGF secretion from SMCs and
this stimulation was abolished by Hoe140 (11), we also exam￾ined whether nifedipine induces VEGF secretion through a
B2 receptor-PKC pathway (Fig. 4). We preincubated cells for
1 h with or without Go6983 and Hoe140, then incubated them
with nifedipine or BK for 18 h. BK-induced VEGF secretion
was blocked by Go6983 and Hoe140 as a positive control.
Nifedipine-induced VEGF secretion was also blocked by
Go6983 and Hoe140, suggesting that nifedipine-induced

secretion was mediated by a B2 receptor-PKC pathway.
Discussion
There are several findings in our study. First, the CCB nife￾dipine was shown to indirectly induce EC tube formation. We
also found that PKC and B2 BK receptor played key signaling
roles in nifedipine-induced VEGF secretion. Our findings
suggest that HCSMC-derived VEGF plays a role in mediating
coronary artery angiogenesis, at least in the in vitro model
used here. Nifedipine may improve coronary microvascular
blood flow in addition to its main effect of reducing blood
pressure.
Several agents have been shown to increase VEGF produc￾tion in a diverse range of cell systems. VEGF expression can
be upregulated by hypoxia, platelet-derived growth factor
(PDGF), transforming growth factor β (22), BK (20), and
phorbol esters (23). We found that stimulation of HCSMCs
with nifedipine resulted in a time- and concentration-depen￾dent increase in VEGF secretion. We also characterized the
BK receptor involved in this effect using a B2 receptor antag￾onist. Two subtypes of BK receptors, B1 and B2, have been
defined based on their pharmacological properties. Most of
the effects of BK have been reported to be linked to B2 recep￾tor activation, whereas the functions of the B1 receptor are
largely unknown. In our in vitro system, B2 receptor, but not
B1 receptor, is expressed in HCSMCs, based on RT-PCR
(Miura et al., unpublished observation). Although this does
not mean that the B1 receptor plays no role in VEGF secre￾tion, nifedipine induced VEGF secretion through the B2
receptor in our system. The finding that VEGF secretion was
mediated by the B2 receptor was consistent with a previous
study (11) by Fukuo et al. in SMCs. They found that nife￾dipine indirectly upregulated superoxide dismutase expres￾sion in ECs by stimulating VEGF secretion from adjacent
vascular SMCs. In this study, we focused on whether nife￾dipine indirectly stimulates HCEC tube formation by stimu￾lating VEGF secretion from HCSMCs. In addition, we found
a clear interaction between VEGF and the KDR/Flk-1/NO
pathway.
PKC is a family of isoenzymes that transduce a wide range
of biological signals in diverse cell systems (24). To probe the
role of PKC in nifedipine-mediated BK-induced VEGF secre￾tion, we studied the effect of two PKC inhibitors, Go6983 and
bis-indolyl maleimide (24). We found that these inhibitors
blocked nifedipine- or BK-induced VEGF secretion, which
suggests that PKC plays a role in VEGF secretion. Our results
are consistent with those of previous studies which have
shown that PKC plays a role in VEGF production in response
to stretching and cytokines in other biological systems (21,
22). On the other hand, Block et al. showed that nifedipine
inhibited the action of recombinant PDGF in vascular SMCs
and reduced PKC activation (25, 26). In addition, the inhibi￾tion of ischemia-induced permeability by nifedipine may be
mediated by PKC-α inhibition independent of calcium chan￾nels (27). These effects were observed at pharmacological
concentrations that were 1 to 2 orders of magnitude lower
than those required for inhibition of the depolarization￾induced opening of voltage-sensitive L-type calcium chan￾nels (28). Nifedipine may accumulate in membranous struc￾tures, resulting in higher localized concentrations (29). Thus,
the concentrations of nifedipine used in our experiments are
comparable to the clinical plasma concentration (18) used in
the treatment of patients with cardiovascular disease. The
effects of higher or lower concentrations of nifedipine may be
quite different. More detailed investigations will be required
to determine the details of nifedipine-induced PKC inhibition,
including a consideration of PKC isoforms.
CCBs inhibit the proliferation of mesangial cells, which
have no L-type calcium channels (8). Nifedipine has also
been shown to inhibit ischemia-induced permeability in ECs,
which also have no L-type calcium channels (27). These
reports suggest that nifedipine-induced signaling may be
independent of L-type calcium channels. In this study, nife￾Fig. 3. The PKC inhibitors, Go6850 and Go6976, decreased
nifedipine-induced VEGF secretion from HCSMCs. The

dipine did not directly increase VEGF secretion from ECs and
did not induce EC tube formation. Therefore, our results sug￾gest that cellular interaction between HCECs and HCSMCs is
very important for nifedipine-induced angiogenesis, and nife￾dipine-induced VEGF secretion might be dependent of L￾type calcium channels in HCSMCs.
As shown in Fig. 5, the cascade we propose is that nife￾dipine activates PKC through the B2 receptor, and the acti￾vated PKC increases VEGF secretion. The VEGF secretion
then directly induces HCEC tube formation via the KDR/Flk￾1/NO pathway. CCBs may thus have novel beneficial effects
in improving coronary microvascular blood flow in addition
to their main effect of reducing blood pressure.
