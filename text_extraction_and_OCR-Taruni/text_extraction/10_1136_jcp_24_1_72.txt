Bronchiolitis obliterans, bronchiectasis, and other sequelae of adenovirus
type 21 infection in young children

Abstract
A remarkably high incidence of bronchiectasis and other pulmonary
sequelae was observed in young children affected during an
epidemic of severe lower respiratory tract infections apparently
caused by adenovirus type 21. The histopathological findings are
described in four cases in which one or both lungs were obtained
for examination at intervals ranging from two months to three years
after the acute infections. Widespread bronchiolar obliteration
(bronchiolitis obliterans) was a striking finding in all four. The


severity of bronchial inflammation and of bronchiectasis was
proportional to the time elapsed since the acute infections.
Bronchiolar obliteration is a likely sequel of the necrotizing
bronchiolitis which may occur during acute adenovirus infections.
The role of bronchiolar obliteration in the pathogenesis of
bronchiectasis and other chronic lung disease is discussed.
Adenoviruses may be a major cause of post-infectious bronchiectasis
in childhood.
