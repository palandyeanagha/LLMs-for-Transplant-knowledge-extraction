The American Cancer Society estimates that, in 2005, 
there were over 667,000 new cases of liver cancer
worldwide. The 5-year survival rate of individuals with 
liver cancer in the United States is only 8.9% despite 
aggressive conventional therapy, marking this malig￾nancy as the second most lethal cancer after pancreatic 
ductal adenocarcinoma (4.4% survival at 5 years)1,2. The 
lethality of liver cancer stems in part from its resistance 
to existing anticancer agents, a lack of biomarkers that 
can detect surgically resectable incipient disease, and 
underlying liver disease that limits the use of chemo￾therapeutic drugs. In cases of limited disease, surgical 
tumour resection represents an effective therapeutic 
alternative (particularly in cases without underlying 
liver cirrhosis). Several local ablation treatment methods, 
such as ethanol injection or radiofrequency, are also 
used in cases of limited disease. Similarly, liver trans￾plantation epitomizes a radical treatment option, but 
only when patients meet stringent specific criteria1
.
Liver cancer comprises diverse, histologically dis￾tinct primary hepatic neoplasms, which include hepa￾tocellular carcinoma (HCC), intrahepatic bile duct 
carcinoma (cholangiocarcinoma), hepatoblastoma, 
bile duct cystadenocarcinoma, haemangiosarcoma 
and epitheliod haemangioendothelioma3
. Among 
these, HCC is the most common type of liver cancer, 
representing 83% of all cases2
. This Review summarizes 
the magnitude of the HCC problem, current scientific 
knowledge of the pathobiology and genetics of HCC, 
and outstanding challenges and potential opportunities 
for the study and treatment of this prominent human 
disease. For information on the important topic of 
epidemiology of HCC, the reader is referred to an 
excellent recent review4
.
Aetiologies of hepatocellular carcinoma
HCC affects all segments of the world population, 
although significant differences in HCC incidence in 
various countries reflect the regional differences in 
the prevalence of specific aetiological factors as well as 
ethnicity2
. The most prominent factors associated with 
HCC include chronic hepatitis B and C viral infection, 
chronic alcohol consumption, aflatoxin-B1-contaminated 
food and virtually all cirrhosis-inducing conditions5
. 
Other aetiological factors have also been proposed 
to lead to HCC, albeit at a lower frequency (BOX 1). 
In addition, gender can also influence the risk and 
behaviour of HCC, with males accounting for a larger 
fraction of cases4
.
Viral-induced hepatocarcinogenesis.There are two main 
hepatitis viruses associated with the development of 
HCC. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infects approximately 2 
billion individuals worldwide and causes an estimated 
320,000 deaths annually. Approximately 30–50% of 
HBV-related deaths are attributable to HCC6
. The impact 
of HBV infection on HCC development is reflected by 
the correlation between increased incidence of HCC in 
patients with increasing levels of HBV DNA in serum7
. 
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infects approximately 170 
million individuals worldwide8
. Approximately 20% 
of chronic HCV cases develop liver cirrhosis, and 2.5% 
develop HCC9
. The viral-associated mechanisms driving 
hepatocarcinogenesis are complex and involve both host 
and viral factors.
HBV is a non-cytopathic, partially double-stranded 
hepatotropic DNA virus classified as a member of the 
hepadnaviridae family. The HBV genome encodes 
several viral proteins essential to its life cycle, including a

Hepatocellular carcinoma pathogenesis: 
from genes to environment
Paraskevi A. Farazi*‡§ and Ronald A. DePinho‡¶
Abstract | Hepatocellular carcinoma is among the most lethal and prevalent cancers in the 
human population. Despite its significance, there is only an elemental understanding of the 
molecular, cellular and environmental mechanisms that drive disease pathogenesis, and 
there are only limited therapeutic options, many with negligible clinical benefit. This Review 
summarizes the current state of knowledge of this, the most common and dreaded liver 
neoplasm, and highlights the principal challenges and scientific opportunities that are 
relevant to controlling this accelerating global health crisis.

chronic liver disease provoke

associated with cellular 
proliferation, the acquisition 
of myofibroblast morphology 
and the robust synthesis of 
extracellular matrix 
components such as collagen, 
therefore contributing to liver 
fibrosis.
reverse transcriptase/DNA polymerase (pol), the capsid 
protein known as hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAg), and 
the L, M and S envelope proteins that associate with the 
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane as part of their 
replication process. HBV also encodes a number of pro￾teins whose functions are not fully understood, such as 
protein x (HBx)10.
Several lines of evidence support the direct involve￾ment of HBV in the transformation process. First, HBV 
genome integration has been associated with host DNA 
microdeletions11 that can target cancer-relevant genes 
including telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT), 
platelet-derived-growth-factor receptor-β (PDGFRβ), 
PDGFβ and mitogen activated protein kinase 1 (MAPK1), 
among others12. Second, HBx transcriptional activation 
activity can alter the expression of growth-control genes, 
such as SRC tyrosine kinases, Ras, Raf, MAPK, ERK, JNK
and others13–16. Finally, HBx can bind and inactivate the 
tumour suppressor p53 in vitro, therefore increasing 
cellular proliferation and survival and compromising 
DNA-damage checkpoints16,17. The hepatocarcinogenic 
potential of HBx has been genetically validated in HBx 
transgenic mice, of which 90% develop HCC18,19.
Host–viral interactions seem to contribute to hepato￾carcinogenesis in several ways. A robust T-cell immune 
response is presumably elicited to combat viral infection, 
however, this response contributes to hepatocyte necro￾sis, inflammation and consequently regeneration, lead￾ing to carcinogenesis10,20–22. Although infection is clearly 
acute in most cases, 10% of adults experience inefficient 
HBV clearance and develop chronic active infection 
with associated sustained cycles of necrosis–inflamma￾tion–regeneration10,23. Such continuous replication of 
hepatocytes might enable the propagation of oncogenic 
lesions and telomere erosion with consequent genomic 
instability (see below) (FIG. 1). Another proposed mecha￾nism of HBV-induced hepatocarcinogenesis might stem 
from viral–ER physical interactions24 that provoke ER 
stress and ultimately the induction of oxidative stress25, 
which can stimulate growth- and survival-signalling 
pathways, cause mutations through the generation of 
free radicals and activate stellate cells10,26. Therefore, 
HBV can engender a pro-carcinogenic state in the liver 
through many mechanisms10. HBV has also been pro￾posed to increase liver disease and consequently hepa￾tocarcinogenesis through HBV mutations that might 
enable the virus to escape the host’s immune response 
and/or result in the retention of the virus within the 
cell, therefore damaging hepatocytes and leading to liver 
disease27.
HCV is a non-cytopathic virus of the flaviviridae fam￾ily. The HCV positive-stranded RNA genome encodes 
non-structural proteins (NS2, NS3, NS4A, NS5A and 
NS5B), which associate with the ER membrane to form 
the viral replicase and viral envelope proteins (E1 and 
E2). An important recent advance has been the establish￾ment of a cell-culture model supporting efficient HCV 
replication and infectious particle production22,28–30, 
enabling the molecular dissection of these processes for 
the first time.
At a glance
• Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most lethal cancers, and affects many of the world’s populations.
• Various aetiologies have been linked to HCC development, the most prominent of which include chronic hepatitis B 
(HBV) and C (HCV) viral infection, chronic alcohol consumption and aflatoxin-B1-contaminated food. Virtually all 
cirrhosis-inducing conditions can cause HCC, pointing to important interactions with the host microenvironment.
• HBV-induced hepatocarcinogenesis can involve an array of processes, including host–viral interactions, sustained 
cycles of necrosis–inflammation–regeneration, viral–endoplasmic-reticulum interactions (induction of oxidative stress), 
viral integration into the host genome (and associated host DNA deletions) and the targeted activation of oncogenic 
pathways by various viral proteins.
• HCV-induced hepatocarcinogenesis also provokes similar biological processes, but is associated with a propensity of 
HCV to evade the host’s immune responses and to promote cirrhosis.
• Alcohol-induced hepatocarcinogenesis is associated with the induction of inflammation and, consequently, cycles of 
hepatocyte necrosis and regeneration, oxidative stress and cirrhosis. Aflatoxin-B1-induced hepatocarcinogenesis is 
mostly associated with carcinogenic mutations.
• Various genetic events have been associated with the development of HCC, such as the inactivation of the tumour 
suppressor p53, mutations in β-catenin, overexpression of various ErbB receptor family members and overexpression of 
the MET receptor. In addition, various cancer-relevant genes seem to be targeted on the epigenetic level (methylation) 
in human HCC.
• Genomic instability is a common feature of human HCC. Various mechanisms are thought to contribute, including 
telomere erosion, chromosome segregation defects and alterations in the DNA-damage-response pathways.
• There are many genomic alterations in HCC. Comparative genomic hybridization studies so far have pointed to 
frequent chromosomal gains in 1q, 6p, 8q, 11q and 17q, and losses in 1p, 4q, 8p, 13q and 17p. Attempts have also been 
made to relate particular genomic alterations to aetiology and tumour-stage, albeit to a limited extent.
• Gene-expression analyses of human HCCs have led to the successful molecular classification of HCCs on the basis of 
prognosis, aetiology and intrahepatic recurrence.
• Many challenges and opportunities exist in this field, including the need for a more detailed and clinically grounded 
genomic characterization of human HCCs, deeper understanding of the mechanisms of genomic instability, host–viral 
interactions, microenvironmental processes (inflammation and cirrhosis), cell of origin in hepatocarcinogenesis and the 
identification of biomarkers to identify early stage disease as well as those at greatest risk of developing HCC.

Hepatic steatosis
Also known as fatty liver, 
hepatic steatosis is a process 
that involves the accumulation 
of fatty acids in hepatocytes. 
One feature of steatohepatitis 
is an increase in reactive 
oxygen species generation, 
which results in lipid 
peroxidation.
Küpffer cells
These are specialized 
macrophages located in the 
liver. The activation of these 
cells by various insults (as for 
example, exposure to bacterial 
endotoxin) results in the 
release of various cytokines in 
the liver that might lead to 
hepatocyte death or damage.
HCV possesses three important clinico-biological 
distinctions from HBV that are relevant to hepato￾carcinogenesis. First, HCV shows a higher propensity 
to yield chronic infection — 10% of HBV cases versus 
60–80% of HCV22. This might relate to immune evasion 
by HCV quasi-species generated from high rates of repli￾cation errors22,31. The second key difference is the greater 
propensity of HCV to promote liver cirrhosis compared 
with HBV. 5–10% of HCV-infected patients develop liver 
cirrhosis after 10 years of infection, a frequency that is 
approximately 10–20-fold higher than HBV22, a highly 
relevant association as cirrhosis is a significant correlate 
of HCC development. Third, as HCV is an RNA virus 
without a DNA intermediate form, it cannot integrate 
into host genomes22.
Both viral and host factors are thought to contrib￾ute to HCC development in the setting of HCV infec￾tion10, analogous to HBV. One theory for HCV-induced 
hepatocarcinogenesis posits that the continuous cycles 
of hepatocyte death caused by the immune response to 
the virus and subsequent regeneration provide a context 
for the accumulation and propagation of mutations. In 
addition, it is possible that immune responses to viral 
infection promote hepatocarcinogenesis in a manner 
substantiated by a transgenic skin-tumour model in 
which deficiencies in pro-inflammatory T cells have 
been shown to correlate with decreased tumour inci￾dence and impaired progression32. On the other hand, 
the relevance of this immune-mediated mechanism is 
less clear in light of the feeble immunological response 
in chronically HCV-infected livers10. In support of this 
notion, HCV RNA and/or core proteins have been sug￾gested to impair dendritic cell functions that are impor￾tant for T-cell activation33. Furthermore, the HCV core 
protein and the NS5A non-structural protein have been 
implicated in the evasion from immune-mediated cell 
killing by interacting with various factors involved in 
this process (such as tumour-necrosis factor-α (ΤΝFα) 
receptor, interferon-α (IFNα) and others)34–36. In addi￾tion, the NS3 and NS4A HCV proteins use their pro￾tease function to cleave and activate components that 
are integral for signalling the immune response37,38. 
Various other immune-evasion mechanisms are used 
by HCV proteins, as detailed elsewhere39. Overall, the 
pathogenetic interactions between the immune system 
and HCV-induced HCC are extremely complex and 
not fully understood, and will therefore benefit from 
continued investigation.
HCV co-opts the ER as part of its replication proc￾ess, and can cause ER stress with all the aforementioned 
pro-carcinogenic effects. In addition, HCV core pro￾teins have been shown to interact with components of 
the MAPK signalling pathway (such as ERK, MEK and 
Raf) and therefore modulate cell proliferation40,41 (FIG. 1). 
NS5A has also been shown to interact with and inacti￾vate p53 by sequestration to the perinuclear membrane, 
thereby affecting the p53-regulated pathways that con￾trol cell-cycle progression, cellular survival, response to 
hypoxic and genotypic stresses, and tumour angiogen￾esis42. The carcinogenic potential of HCV core proteins 
is also indicated by the development of hepatic steato￾sis, the induction of reactive oxygen species and the 
development of HCC in transgenic mice that harbour 
the entire HCV core gene under the control of HBV 
transcriptional regulatory elements, which raises the 
possibility that HCV-induced HCC involves an oxida￾tive-stress-mediated mechanism43. Finally, core-E1-E2 
transgenic mice develop HCCs whose robust tumour 
growth seems to be due to the inhibition of apoptosis 
by the E1/E2 HCV proteins44.
Alcohol-induced hepatocarcinogenesis. Alcohol is an 
important HCC risk factor. Chronic alcohol intake 
has been implicated in causing the production of pro￾inflammatory cytokines through monocyte activation45
and provoking increased concentrations of circulating 
endotoxin, activating Küpffer cells which release many 
chemo kines and cytokines (including TNFα, inter￾leukin-1β (IL1β), IL6 and prostaglandin E2
) with adverse 
effects on hepatocyte survival. In the setting of chronic 
ethanol exposure, hepatocytes show increased sensitivity 
to the cytotoxic effects of TNFα46, which sets the stage 
for chronic hepatocyte destruction–regeneration, stellate 
cell activation, cirrhosis and ultimately HCC.
Alcohol also damages the liver through oxidative￾stress mechanisms. Alcoholic hepatitis shows increased 
isoprostane, a marker of lipid peroxidation45. Oxidative 
stress might contribute to hepatocarcinogenesis in several 
ways. First, oxidative stress promotes the development 
of fibrosis and cirrhosis, which are key features of a per￾missive HCC microenvironment. The pro-carcinogenic 
effect of the cirrhotic microenvironment has been shown 
in the mouse, where PDGF transgenic mice develop 
fibrosis that progresses to HCC47. As stellate cells are the 
main source of collagen deposition in the injured liver, 
it is notable that oxidative-stress induction of cultured 
Box 1 | Other aetiological factors associated with HCC
In addition to the most common aetiological factors presented in this review, other 
factors have been proposed to have a role in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with a 
lower frequency, including:
• Long-term oral contraceptive use in women, although a definitive connection to the 
development of HCC will require an expanded study70.
• Certain metabolic disorders such as: hereditary haemochromatosis, which is 
associated with increased iron absorption by liver cells and hepatocellular 
damage5,180; porphyria cutanea tarda, which is also characterized by increased iron 
uptake in the liver, and in some cases is associated with increased inflammation, 
necrosis and fibrosis5,181; α1-antitrypsin deficiency, which involves the increased 
appearance of antitrypsin polymers in hepatocytes, provoking hepatocyte death and 
cirrhosis5,182; and hereditary tyrosinaemia, which involves defects in tyrosine 
metabolism that result in toxic metabolites in the liver with potential mutagenic 
properties5,183.
• Diabetes: a higher incidence of HCC has been described in diabetic patients with no 
previous history of liver disease associated with other factors184. This predisposition 
might relate to insulin resistance and associated increased free fatty acids in the liver 
and the accumulation of hepatic triglycerides (fatty liver disease). Such intrahepatic 
accumulation of lipids can lead to hepatocellular injury, hepatocyte apoptosis, 
cytokine induction, and oxygen radical generation due to fatty acid oxidation, and 
ultimately the development of fibrosis185.
• Non-alcoholic fatty liver disorders (NAFLD) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis 
contribute to the development of fibrosis and cirrhosis, and therefore might also 
contribute to HCC development185,186.

stellate cells through treatment with isoprostanes can 
promote increased cell proliferation and collagen syn￾thesis, which are characteristics of the fibrotic response48. 
Second, ethanol-induced oxidative stress might have an 
effect on HCC-relevant signalling pathways, such as the 
documented reduction in tyrosine phosphorylation of 
STAT1 (signal transducer and activator of transcrip￾tion 1), decreased STAT1-directed activation of IFNγ
signalling, and the loss of the protective effects of IFNγ
with consequent hepatocyte damage49. Oxidative stress 
might also cause the accumulation of oncogenic muta￾tions. For example, increased oxidative stress associated 
with iron overload (hereditary haemochromatosis) has 
been associated with p53 mutations in resultant HCCs50. 
Finally, although speculative, oxidative stress might 
accelerate telomere shortening, which would in turn 
fuel the development of liver cirrhosis, chromosomal 
instability and ultimately HCC (see below)51.
Aflatoxin-B1-induced hepatocarcinogenesis. Ingestion 
of the fungal toxin, aflatoxin B1, also poses an increased 
risk for the development of HCC. Aflatoxin B1 seems 
to function as a mutagen, and is associated with a spe￾cific p53 mutation16,52–55 and cooperating mutational 
activation of oncogenes such as HRAS56 (FIG. 1). Unlike 
HCV-induced and alcohol-induced hepatocarcinogen￾esis there is no clear connection between aflatoxin B1 
exposure and the development of cirrhosis, indicating 
that the mutational actions of this toxin might be the pri￾mary driver of HCC development. It is worth noting that 
aflatoxin B1 exposure often coexists with HBV infection, 
and such individuals possess a 5–10-fold increased risk 
of developing HCC compared with exposure to only 
one of these factors57. The mechanistic basis for this 
synergy is not known, although it seems plausible that 
cooperation would derive from aflatoxin-B1-induced 
mutagenesis and continuous hepatocyte turnover and 
regeneration during chronic HBV infection.
Common molecular themes in hepatocarcinogenesis. A 
survey of the diverse hepatocarcinogenesis mechanisms 
points to common pathogenetic pathways and proc￾esses (FIG. 1). In particular, p53 inactivation or muta￾tion seems to be a consistent event in HBV-, HCV- and 
aflatoxin-B1-induced HCC. Furthermore, inflamma￾tion, continuous rounds of necrosis and regeneration, 
and oxidative stress are characteristic of HBV-, HCV- and 
alcohol-induced hepatocarcinogenesis, suggesting that 
these processes contribute in fundamental ways to HCC 
development. Both HBV and HCV activate the MAPK 
pathway, which also indicates its pathogenetic relevance. 
The identification of additional common molecular 
changes among the different aetiological factors would 
be important in the drug-discovery industry, as it would 
hold the greatest return on investment and increase the 
economic probability of developing and deploying these 
agents, particularly in underserved populations.
Despite some common molecular changes, the cel￾lular and molecular bases of hepatocarcinogenesis are 
likely to differ significantly across the various aetiologi￾cal factors, and such differences might also hold mecha￾nistic clues and preventive or therapeutic opportunities. 
One potential opportunity could relate to the propensity 
of HBV to integrate into host genomes (in contrast to 
HCV), causing alterations in cancer-relevant genes. 
Prevention of this integration process might provide

the liver microenvironment brought about by HCV and 
alcohol might also provide new therapeutic strategies for 
targeting host–tumour heterotypic interactions. Such 
wide-ranging differences across the various aetiologies 
also caution that limited pathogenetic and treatment 
insights will emerge from genomic profile data that have 
not been linked to a specific aetiological agent.
Genetic and epigenetic events in HCC
The next subsections describe the current knowledge 
of the genetic and genomic events associated with the 
development of HCC. The neoplastic evolution of HCC 
proceeds through a multi-step histological process 
that is less well defined than that of other cancer types 
(FIG. 2). As noted above, diverse HCC-inducing aetiolo￾gies provoke continuous rounds of hepatocyte damage 
and regeneration, culminating in chronic liver disease. 
Hyperplastic nodules of regenerating hepatocytes have 
normal cytological features, and represent a potential 
first step towards HCC. These lesions can progress to 
pre-malignant dysplastic nodules, which have abnor￾mal cytological features including clear cell changes and 
nuclear crowding, and these lesions are associated with the 
increased thickening of the trabeculae, which indicates 
abnormal liver architecture. These dysplastic nodules 
can evolve to frank HCC which, in addition to all the 
aforementioned abnormal features, is endowed with 
the capacity to invade the surrounding fibrous stroma 
and vessels, and occasionally has metastatic potential58. 
The molecular analysis of human HCC has shown many 
genetic and epigenetic alterations that result in the 
deregulation of key oncogenes and tumour-suppressor 
genes including TP53, β-catenin, ErbB receptor family 
members, MET and its ligand hepatocyte growth factor 
(HGF), p16(INK4a), E-cadherin and cyclooxygenase 2 
(COX2).
The p53 tumour suppressor. Although it is widely 
accepted that p53 deficiency participates in the devel￾opment of HCC, whether p53 mutation contributes to 
cancer initiation, progression or both remains an area 
of active investigation. In an HBx transgenic mouse 
model16,18, the functional inactivation of p53 by HBx 
(through the sequestration of p53 to the cytoplasm) was 
documented in HCCs but not in altered foci (initiation 
foci), implicating p53 in constraining progression to 
HCC. Furthermore, mutations in p53 were only detected 
in larger HCCs, suggesting that full genetic inactivation 
of p53 is associated with progression to late-stage disease. 
In humans, analyses of HBV- and HCV-related HCCs 
have shown a greater frequency of p53 mutations in 
advanced malignancies (43%) than in regenerative nod￾ules (~7%)59. Although such patterns are indicative of a 
role in progression, they do not exclude the possibilities
that p53 mutant regenerative nodules are those that 
Figure 2 | Histopathological progression and molecular features of HCC. After hepatic injury incurred by any one of 
several factors (hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), alcohol and aflatoxin B1), there is necrosis followed by 
hepatocyte proliferation. Continuous cycles of this destructive–regenerative process fosters a chronic liver disease 
condition that culminates in liver cirrhosis. Cirrhosis is characterized by abnormal liver nodule formation surrounded by 
collagen deposition and scarring of the liver. Subsequently, hyperplastic nodules are observed, followed by dysplastic 
nodules and ultimately hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), which can be further classified into well differentiated, 
moderately differentiated and poorly differentiated tumours — the last of which represents the most malignant form of 
primary HCC. Telomere shortening is a feature of chronic liver disease and cirrhosis. Telomerase reactivation has been 
associated with hepatocarcinogenesis (its activation in the early versus late stages of disease is still a point of debate, and
is discussed in the text). Loss and/or mutation of p53 and genomic instability also characterize hepatocarcinogenesis. p53 
loss and/or mutation is shown to occur during progression to HCC, however, there is some evidence that loss and 
mutation of p53 might also occur in the initial stages of hepatocarcinogenesis (this is discussed in the text in more detail).

have ‘initiated’ a productive carcinogenic process, or 
that rare p53 mutant cells are much more common in 
regenerative nodules but not detected by conventional 
sequencing approaches. In the context of aflatoxin B1, 
regions of high aflatoxin B1 exposure show frequent p53 
mutations in early-stage HCC lesions52, whereas regions 
of low aflatoxin B1 exposure show p53 mutations in 
much later stages of HCC60–62. However, no correlation 
was found between p53 mutation and tumour stages in 
a study of HCCs from southern Africa, where aflatoxin 
B1 exposure is common16,53, although this could relate 
to the limited number of tumours that were examined 
in this study.
On the basis of the above data, it seems plausible that 
p53 mutation might operate in either HCC initiation or 
progression, depending on the context. In the setting of 
aflatoxin B1, this mutation might serve to drive initiation 
with other cooperating events (the need for cooperating 
events seems evident from the lack of an HCC-prone 
phenotype in p53 mutant mice). In the context of other 
aetiologies such as those that provoke regeneration, oxi￾dative stress and telomere erosion, the loss of p53 might 
have a more prominent role in HCC progression by 
facilitating continued proliferative potential in the face 
of activated DNA-damage signalling, which could also 
contribute to genomic instability in HCC (see below). 
Along these lines, p53 heterozygosity through germline 
mutation enables HCC progression in mice with short 
telomeres in a chronic liver disease model of HCC, 
suggesting that p53 cooperates with telomere-induced 
chromosomal instability in liver tumour progression63.
The role of p53 in hepatocarcinogenesis has also 
been shown in other mouse models. HBV large envelop 
protein (HBsAg) transgenic mice have an HCC-prone 
condition64–66 that is accelerated and made fully penetrant 
when combined with aflatoxin B1 treatment and the 
p53ser246 allele, which corresponds to the p53 codon 
249 mutation of HCC patients exposed to aflatoxin B1 
(REFS 64,66). Similarly, increased progression to high￾grade HCC is observed in aflatoxin-B1-treated HBsAg 
mice heterozygous for a p53 null allele (REFS 65,66).
β-catenin. β-catenin is a crucial downstream component 
of the Wnt signalling pathway. When Wnt signalling is 
engaged, the adenomatosis polyposis coli (APC) and 
Axin proteins no longer bind β-catenin, with consequent 
β-catenin stabilization and translocation to the nucleus 
where it associates with the Tcf family of transcription 
factors. This transcription factor complex transactivates 
a host of target genes governing cancer-relevant proc￾esses, including MYC, cyclin D1, COX2, and matrix 
metalloproteinase 7 (MMP7)67.
β-catenin mutations and increased nuclear expres￾sion have been detected in human HCC68,69. In some 
reports, β-catenin overexpression and mutations have 
been related to early-stage HCCs70,71, and in others to 
HCC progression72. Overexpression and mutations of 
β-catenin occur more frequently in HCV-related HCCs 
compared with HBV-related HCCs70,73,74. However, 
β-catenin is stabilized by the HBx protein in hepatoma 
cells, and therefore implicated in HBV-related HCC75.
Some studies suggest that β-catenin mutations 
function independently of other cancer-relevant genes, 
such as TP53. For example, Torbenson et al. recently 
suggested that the overexpression of p53 and β-catenin 
in HCCs were not correlated76. However, Prange et al. 
found that the accumulation of nuclear β-catenin was 
correlated with increased nuclear p53 expression and the 
loss of E-cadherin77. It should be noted that Torbenson 
and colleagues did not examine the mutational status of 
p53, and therefore the possibillity cannot be excluded 
that the mutational inactivation of p53 might be present 
in the same tumours with β-catenin overexpression.
It has also been suggested that β-catenin mutations 
are typical in HCCs that are not characterized by genomic 
instability. Human HCCs with high rates of genomic 
instability, as detected by their increased loss of hetero￾zygosity (LOH), show very low levels of β-catenin muta￾tions78. Studies in the mouse have shown that HCCs have 
either a high rate of β-catenin mutations or high genomic 
instability. These provocative findings indicate that abro￾gation of the Wnt signalling pathway could represent an 
alternative route to hepatocarcinogenesis79.
ErbB receptor family. The ErbB family of receptor tyro￾sine kinases consists of four members (ERBB1–ERBB4), 
which have been implicated in the development of vari￾ous types of human cancers. The examination of these 
receptor tyrosine kinases has documented the over￾expression of ERBB1 (also known as epidermal growth 
factor receptor (EGFR)) in 68% of HCC cases, ERBB3 in 
84%, ERBB2 (also known as HER2) in 21% and ERBB4 
in 61% (but at a lower level)80. ERBB1 and ERBB3 expres￾sion correlated with a more aggressive presentation, such 
as a high proliferation index, intrahepatic metastasis, 
de-differentiation and tumour size80. Further support that 
ERBB1 could be integral to hepatocarcinogenesis comes 
from the inhibition of ERBB1 by gefitinib, which results 
in growth inhibition, cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis in 
human HCC cell lines81, and also shows activity in a rat 
model of HCC82. In a limited phase II clinical study of 38 
patients with HCC, another ERBB1 inhibitor, erlotinib, 
showed clinical efficacy as evidenced by disease control 
in 59% of participating patients and 32% of patients 
remaining progression-free at 6 months after treatment83. 
Further evidence for the involvement of the ErbB family 
of receptors in hepatocarcinogenesis comes from studies 
in mice. Mice transgenic for transforming growth fac￾tor-α (TGFα) (a member of the EGF family and a ligand 
for ErbB receptors) develop HCCs84,85. Hepatocarcinogen 
treatment accelerates HCC development in the TGFα 
transgenic strain, whereas it generates smaller hepatic 
neoplasms in TGFα-deficient mice86,87. Compound 
TGFα and MYC transgenic mice show increased hepa￾tocarcinogenesis that is associated with the disruption of 
TGFβ1 signalling16,88–91 and chromosomal losses, some 
of which are syntenic to those in human HCCs that 
include the retinoblastoma (RB) tumour-suppressor 
locus89. TGFα can also cooperate with HBV transgenic 
strains to effectively increase HCC incidence. Together, 
these studies underscore the prime importance of TGFα
signalling in HCC development92.

Küpffer cells and stellate cells

MET and HGF. Overexpression of the MET receptor 
has been reported in advanced human HCCs93. The 
role of MET signalling in HCC development has been 
confirmed in mouse models, whereby mice transgenic 
for the MET ligand HGF, one of the most potent hepa￾tocyte mitogens, develop HCCs by 1.5 years of age94. 
Correspondingly, hepatic-directed expression of an 
inducible activated MET transgene resulted in the 
development of HCC, and the extinction of transgene 
expression resulted in tumour regression by apoptosis 
and impaired cell proliferation95.
Methylation of cancer-relevant genes. Aberrant DNA 
methylation patterns have been reported in human 
HCC70,96–99. Methylation has been detected in the earliest 
stages of hepatocarcinogenesis, and to a greater extent in 
tumour progression100. Specific hypermethylation events 
in HCC have targeted p16(INK4a), E-cadherin, COX2, 
apoptosis-associated speck-like protein (ASC) and deleted 
in liver cancer 1 (DLC1), among others16,101–107. The biolog￾ical significance of the hypermethylation of some of these 
genes in hepatocarcinogenesis has been evaluated in HCC 
cell lines. Specifically, treatment of hepatoma cells with a 
demethylating agent increases p16(INK4a) (REF. 107) and 
COX2 expression104, both of which are associated with the 
inhibition of cell proliferation. Therefore, the epigenetic 
silencing of key cancer genes seems relevant to hepato￾carcinogenesis, and might provide another route to the 
development of a new class of anti-oncological agents.
Genomic instability in HCC
Telomeres and telomerase. Telomere shortening has been 
described as a key feature of chronic hyperproliferative 
liver disease108–111, specifically occurring in the hepatocyte 
compartment112 (FIG. 2). These observations have fueled 
speculation that telomere shortening associated with 
chronic liver disease and hepatocyte turnover contribute 
to the induction of genomic instability that drives human 
HCC. In this regard, the analysis of human hepatoma has 
established a correlation between telomere shortening and 
increased chromosomal instability113,114. Correspondingly, 
the modeling of HCC in a telomerase knockout mouse 
model has shown that telomere dysfunction has a role in 
increasing liver cancer initiation115.
Another aspect of telomere biology common to HCC 
is the robust activation of telomerase (correlating with 
increased TERT mRNA levels) in nearly 90% of human 
HCCs116–118. Intriguingly, HBV has been shown to inte￾grate in the TERT locus in human HCCs, indicating that 
the proximal placement of viral enhancers might increase 
TERT gene expression119. Amplification of the gene that 
encodes the telomerase RNA component (TERC)120
and the allelic loss of chromosome 10p (in a region that 
encodes a putative telomerase repressor)121 has been 
reported in HCCs.
Telomerase re-activation has been suggested to 
promote HCC progression (increased microvessel 
density122 and HCC recurrence after resection123). Some 
studies have implicated telomerase in the early stages of 
hepatocarcinogenesis124–127; however, these inconsistent 
findings might stem from telomerase-positive infiltrating 
lymphocytes and resident sinusoidal cells128. Moreover, 
the shorter telomeres of HCCs compared with normal 
livers point to the later stage activation of telomerase in 
HCC development. Collectively, the current data suggest 
a model wherein telomere shortening drives chromo￾somal instability and cancer-promoting lesions during 
early stages of hepatocarcinogenesis, whereas telomerase 
re-activation is necessary for malignant progression as it 
restores chromosomal stability to a level compatible with 
cancer-cell viability. This is supported by studies in the 
TERC null mouse model, where telomere dysfunction 
increased the initiation of hepatic neoplasms whereas 
the absence of telomerase activity impaired HCC pro￾gression115. It should be noted that telomerase might also 
possess oncogenic properties aside from its telomere 
maintenance function129.
It is interesting to note that telomere shortening 
might also contribute to HCC development through the 
creation of a cirrhotic microenvironment. Telomerase 
knockout mice with short telomeres show increased 
liver fibrosis and cirrhosis following injury compared 
with mice with intact telomeres110, possibly because of 
increased hepatocyte death resulting from the telomere 
checkpoint response.
Chromosome segregation defects. Defects in chromo￾some segregation during mitosis result in aneuploidy, 
a common cytogenetic feature of cancer cells including 
HCC. Many genes have been linked to the complex series 
of orchestrated events that insure proper and accurate 
chromosome segregation and, as expected, the mutation 
of these genes results in aneuploidy and increased cancer 
incidence130.
Among the factors involved in chromosome seg￾regation, Aurora kinase A, along with its kinase target 
hepatoma upregulated protein (HURP), are overex￾pressed in HCC131,132. Although the biological function of 
HURP remains to be defined, HURP expression enables 
cells to grow in low serum conditions, which points to an 
oncogenic potential132. Aurora-kinase inhibitors, which 
are currently under development133, could be particu￾larly useful in HCC because of the increased expression 
of Aurora kinase in this cancer.
The spindle-assembly checkpoint has been shown to 
be defective in human HCC cell lines, as evidenced by the 
lack of accumulation of cells in metaphase following treat￾ment with nocodazole or colcemid (which normally arrest 
the cells at metaphase)134. For some cancers, the deactiva￾tion of this checkpoint has been ascribed to mutations in 
spindle-checkpoint genes; however, such mutations have 
yet to be identified in HCC. It is possible that spindle￾checkpoint defects in HCC might stem from mutations 
in p53, p38, BRCA2 and cohesin, molecules that have also 
been linked to similar cytogenetic defects134.
DNA-damage-response pathways. Two of the key mol￾ecules that are involved in the DNA damage response, 
p53 and BRCA2, seem to have roles in destabilizing the 
HCC genome130. As noted above, the inactivation of p53 
through mutation or viral oncoprotein sequestration 
is a common event in HCC, and p53 knock-in alleles

containing dominant point mutations have been shown 
to cause genomic instability in mouse models135,136. 
Therefore, it is reasonable to speculate that p53 muta￾tion promotes genomic instability in HCC. In addition, 
LOH of the BRCA2 locus has been documented in 
HCCs, providing another route to genomic instability 
in this disease137,138. It is worth noting that, despite docu￾mentation of deletions or mutations in these and other 
DNA-damage-network genes, their direct roles in the 
genomic instability of HCC have yet to be established in 
genetic model systems. In addition, there remain many 
other network components that merit in-depth study on 
the basis of their expression and functional roles in HCC 
genomic instability.
Genomic alterations in HCC. Significant effort has been 
directed towards charting the genomic events in HCC, 
with the prime goals of understanding the genetic basis 
of the disease and identifying new therapeutic targets. 
To date, karyotypic analyses70,139,140, chromosomal com￾parative genomic hybridization (CGH)70,141–155, and 
LOH mapping16,70,143–145,147–149 have identified recurrent 
regions of copy number change and allelic imbalances 
(TABLE 1). For some loci, the resident cancer gene has 
been identified and validated, as for example: RB (13q); 
BRCA2 (13q); FLT2 (13q); TP53 (17p); HBVS2 (hepa￾titis B virus integration site 2) (4q); hepatoma-derived 
growth factor (HDGF) (1q); ERBB2 (17q); PIM1 (6p); 
and MYC (8q). However, it should be emphasized that 
the large regional gains and losses leave open the possi￾bility that additional oncogenes and tumour-suppressor 
genes reside in these cancer hotspots. Notably, for most 
amplified and deleted loci, the cancer gene targets are 
not certain.
Several studies have attempted to categorize genomic 
changes in relation to tumour stage. In general, high levels 
of chromosomal instability seem to correlate with the 
de-differentiation and progression of HCC156. Several 
studies have suggested certain chromosomal changes 
to be specific to dysplastic lesions70,151, early-stage and 
late-stage HCCs16,70,141,143,147,150,155,157, and metastases149
(TABLE 1), with several oncogenes and tumour-suppressor
genes residing at these loci: MYC (8q24); EMS1 (11q13), 
RB (13q13-14), liver related putative tumour suppres￾sor (LTPS) (8p23.3); TP53 (17p13.1); downregulated 
in liver malignancy (DRLM) (4q21-22); and cyclin A 
(4q32-q-ter). It is important to note that the studies 
that have attempted to compare genomic profiles and 
tumour stage are few in number, often did not classify 
HCCs on the basis of aetiology, and used relatively 
low-resolution genome-scanning platforms.
Several studies have examined whether genomic 
changes seem to track with specific aetiological factors. 
In HBV-associated HCCs, gains in 8q and 20q and the 
loss of 4q are observed more frequently in HCCs with no 
underlying cirrhosis16,157, suggesting that these genetic 
aberrations might facilitate malignant transformation 
in the absence of pro-tumorigenic signals derived 
from a fibrotic matrix. Several loci have been spe￾cifically identified in HBV-, HCV- or non-viral-related 
HCCs16,70,141–144,150–154 (TABLE 1). It should be emphasized 
that, although these genome–aetiology correlates 
are intriguing, several studies have failed to uncover 
significant differences in genomic changes between 
the different aetiological groups70,145,155, although this 
outcome might relate to small sample sizes and the 
low-resolution genome-scanning platform used. All 
together, when these genomic studies are viewed in 
aggregate, we reiterate that expanded efforts are war￾ranted, in which greater emphasis is placed on the use of 
precisely annotated HCCs, sufficiently powered sample 
size and high-resolution microarray platforms.

Gene-expression analysis and HCC molecular sub￾classification. Microarray analyses have been used to 
investigate gene-expression changes in HCC. Results 
from such studies have attempted to classify HCCs based 
on their gene-expression patterns, and have successfully 
led to the identification of gene-expression profiles that 
distinguish HBV- from HCV-associated HCCs158, early 
from late intrahepatic recurrence of HCC159, and patients 
with different prognoses160. The molecular classification 
of HCC on the basis of prognosis in the third study was 
further compared with gene-expression profiles of HCCs 
from seven different mouse models161. Interestingly, HCCs 
from some of these mice (MYC, E2F1 and MYCE2F1
transgenics) showed similar gene-expression patterns 
to the ones of HCCs from patients with better survival. 
Coincidentally, in the aforementioned CGH studies, 
8q24 gain (encompassing MYC) was found in early-stage 
HCCs. Interestingly, murine HCCs derived from the 
MYCTGFα transgenic model or diethylnitrosamine￾treated mice show similar gene-expression patterns to 
HCCs from patients with poor survival. As previously 
mentioned, ERBB1 and ERBB3 expression correlate with 
a more aggressive presentation in human HCCs. The 
application of comparative oncogenomic analyses has also 
led to the identification and validation of new oncogenes 
in HCC. Specifically, the search for common recurrent 
amplifications that are present in both human and mouse 
HCC has identified the cell-death inhibitor cIAP1 and 
the transcription factor YAP1. This approach promises 
to facilitate human cancer genome discovery efforts and 
provide animal models for testing drugs directed against 
such validated HCC oncogenes162. Together, these results 
point to the promise of genomic classification and com￾parative genomic studies in understanding tumour char￾acteristics and in providing molecular markers for patient 
classification and, potentially, treatment163,164.
Challenges and opportunities
HCC is an aggressive and enigmatic disease driven by 
diverse aetiologies, ranging from metabolic disorders 
to hepatotoxins to viruses. An important question is 
whether HCCs represent very heterogeneous collections 
of tumour molecular subtypes, and whether specific 
aetiologies drive distinct or common (epi)genetic and 
genomic events during tumour development. As seems 
to be the case for many other solid tumours, the available 
genomic profiles of HCC, with its many amplifications 
and deletions, strongly suggests that there is currently 
limited knowledge of the compendium of genes that 
drive HCC pathogenesis. A comprehensive genomic 
analysis of HCC samples, using a battery of high-resolu￾tion approaches, is urgently needed. We believe that such 
an atlas would transform the field, as this is particularly 
relevant to the development and application of effective 
agents to target specific genetic mutations and specific 
aetiological factors.
As comparative array-CGH analysis of various murine 
cancers has shown that such aberrations often target 
syntenic loci in the analogous human cancer type165, we 
further suggest that a concerted comparative genomic 
analysis of available mouse models of HCC might be par￾ticularly helpful in filtering through the complex human 
cancer genome. At the same time, comparative oncog￾enomic studies would serve to validate murine models by 
assessing the extent to which acquired genomic alterations 
are shared in human and mouse HCCs. Concurrently, 
emphasis should be placed on the design of new mouse 
models that recapitulate key features of the human dis￾ease, including hepatocyte regeneration, genomic insta￾bility and the fibrotic tumour microenvironment (FIG. 3). 
Ultimately, mouse models that share features with human 
HCCs could serve as valuable tools for gene identifica￾tion and drug development. However, one needs to keep 
in mind key differences between mice and humans. 
For example, as noted in certain human HCC cases, 
telomere shortening might drive the genomic instability 
that enables the accumulation of cancer-relevant changes 
for hepatocarcinogenesis. As mice have long telomeres, 
this aspect of hepatocarcinogenesis might be fundamen￾tally different between the species and provide additional 
opportunities for model refinement and testing of this 
mechanism through the use of a telomerase-deficient 
mouse model. These and other cross-species differences, 
and limitations in the use of human cell-culture systems, 
must be considered in any interpretation of data from the 
various model systems.
Figure 3 | Future perspectives on HCC. At present there is a need for new mouse 
models of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) that recapitulate human disease. The 
integration of information from genomic analyses (and the consequent identification of 
new oncogenes and tumour-suppressor genes involved in hepatocarcinogenesis) would 
help to build better animal models of HCC that share many features with the human 
disease. This should enable the identification of the cell of origin in HCC, increase 
understanding of the role of microenvironmental factors in HCC development 
(inflammation and cirrhosis) and improve the design of studies that address 
chemoprevention, biomarker discovery and drug testing. These efforts would aid in 
targeting HCC at its earliest stages before progression to incurable disease. CGH,

Another outstanding and important question in 
HCC pathogenesis involves the cellular origin of this 
cancer. The resolution of the HCC cell of origin issue 
could affect the development of useful preventive strate￾gies to target nascent neoplasms, foster an understand￾ing of how HCC-relevant genetic lesions function in 
that specific cell-developmental context and increase 
our ability to develop more accurate mouse models in 
which key genetic events are targeted to the appropriate 
cellular compartment. Oval cells have been described as
multipotent progenitor cells that can give rise to both 
hepatocytes and bile duct epithelial cells (cholangi￾ocytes)166,167. The precursors of oval cells (that is, adult 
stem cells) reside in the Canal of Hering, and oval cells 
represent the replicating cellular compartment after 
liver injury167. At present, analyses of human HCCs for 
oval-cell markers, comparison of their gene-expression 
patterns with rat fetal hepatoblasts and the cellular char￾acteristics of HCCs from various animal models have 
provided contrasting results about the cellular origin 
of HCC166,168–172. Although these results imply dual 
origins from either oval cells or mature hepatocytes, it 
seems that the conclusive answers will require definitive 
lineage-tracing approaches in refined model systems. 
The liver-stem-cell niche might have a crucial role in 
promoting or suppressing the effect of cancer-relevant 
genetic alterations, and virtually nothing is known 
about these microenvironmental factors and the effect 
of fibrosis or cirrhosis on the liver stem cell niche173. 
Finally, the failure to identify a clear cell of origin for 
HCC might stem from the fact that there are multiple 
cells of origin, perhaps reflecting the developmental 
plasticity of the hepatocyte lineage. Therefore, the com￾parison of hepatocarcinogenesis in genetically modified 
mice that express oncogenes (or lack the expression of 
tumour-suppressor genes) in the hepatocyte or stem cell 
compartment would aid in identifying the elusive cell of 
origin in this cancer (FIG. 3).
A special effort must be directed towards under￾standing the nature of HBV and HCV viral and host 
interactions, particularly the viral and host factors that 
lead to viral persistence and chronic liver destruction. 
Identifying the signalling pathways in the host cells 
that enable viral propagation would aid in developing 
strategies to control viral infection, therefore minimiz￾ing the risk of the development of chronic liver disease, 
cirrhosis and ultimately HCC. In addition, viral-asso￾ciated inflammation and the recent links between 
inflammation and cancer might highlight an oppor￾tunity to pharmacologically quell the pro-carcinogenic 
effects of immunocytes during the formative stages of 
cancer. Along these lines, intra-tumoral immunocytes 
have been shown to enable the angiogenic switch174, 
and inflammation seems to activate pathways that 
support tissue stem cell growth175. Interestingly, as 
discussed previously, some early-stage HCCs show 
proliferating oval cells in the centre of the lesions, 
which indicates that tissue stem cell growth might be 
favoured in some cases176. Considering that inflam￾mation is a common theme across many of the HCC 
aetiologies, it is conceivable that it could contribute to 
such oval-cell proliferation177. These examples make 
obvious how mechanistic insights could lead to the 
effective application of preventive therapies targeting 
the specific cancer-promoting mediators of tumour 
immune cells.
Beyond viral-associated inflammation, there exists a 
poor understanding of the role of the cirrhotic micro￾environment and its constituents in the development of 
liver cancer. Further motivation for an in-depth analy￾sis of host–tumour heterotypic interactions is provided 
by anti-angiogenesis studies showing that bevacizumab
shows promising results (in combination with gemcit￾abine and oxaliplatin) in phase II trials of patients with 
HCC178. Model systems are needed that would enable 
the systematic analysis of various extracellular matrix 
components and stromal cells. Particularly important 
would be investigations of how the disruption of liver 
tissue architecture might disturb the liver stem cell 
niche and possibly promote an expansion of those cells 
at greatest risk of malignant transformation. Using a 
mouse model of HCC in which hepatocarcinogenesis 
is preceded by cirrhosis would seem to be a necessary 
starting point. In this regard, the carbon tetrachloride 
model of hepatocarcinogenesis would be useful for 
such studies, given its propensity to develop a classical 
fibrotic liver microenvironment and HCC115.
As genomic instability is a prevalent feature of 
HCC, and probably contributes to the transformation 
process, the elucidation of the mechanisms driving 
genomic instability might provide new approaches 
designed to detect, reduce or eliminate this process. 
Whether telomere shortening, chromosome segrega￾tion defects, inactivation of DNA-damage-response 
components or other yet-to-be identified mechanisms 
function alone or together to drive genomic instabil￾ity remains an open question, although accumulating 
experimental evidence favours a role for telomere dys￾function in promoting both cirrhosis and carcinogen￾esis, as supported by the telomerase knockout mouse 
model110,115 and shorter telomeres in chronic liver 
disease and HCC in humans108–111. If telomere erosion 
does prove to drive cirrhosis and genomic instabil￾ity in humans, then a serial assessment of telomere 
reserves might provide a useful biomarker to gauge 
both the cirrhotic potential and risk for chromosomal 
instability in the liver. Along these lines, it is plau￾sible that the most rapid advances might come not 
from new therapies for advanced HCC, but rather the 
prevention of disease by viral elimination and/or the 
detection of early neoplasms that are surgically resect￾able. Here again, technological advances in protein 
science and comparative-serum profiling of humans 
and mice with HCC could prove to be highly produc￾tive, with the potential for immediate clinical impact. 
Prevention would also be aided by the identification 
of those individuals who are at greatest risk of HCC 
following exposure to an inciting agent. This effort 
would require large cohort studies involving serial 
follow-up, such as the Health Professional Study, 
which would enable the identification of risk loci in 
the broader population.

Concluding remarks
At present, the liver cancer field faces many challenges but 
equally compelling opportunities to address fundamental 
questions relating to the genetic, cell biological and envi￾ronmental mechanisms of hepatocarcinogenesis, espe￾cially those that relate to aetiology. As our understanding 
of human hepatocarcinogenic mechanisms increases, 
the field will gain the foundation needed to build refined 
animal models that recapitulate the full range of human 
disease. The lethal nature of this cancer and the high 
levels of genomic instability in advanced disease make 
treatment at an earlier stage imperative. Better animal 
models will enable the identification of biomarkers of the 
earliest disease stages, and will aid in the development 
of successful therapeutic interventions. Such efforts are 
of vital interest given the large number of HCV-infected 
individuals and the looming epidemic of associated HCC. 
In the United States alone, there are an estimated 2.7 mil￾lion individuals with chronic HCV infection (1988–1994 
study)2,179, from which 68,000 HCC cases would be pre￾dicted in the coming years. Worldwide, there could be 
~120 million individuals with chronic HCV infection 
from which about 3 million HCC cases are expected to 
occur. In the absence of an HCV vaccine, this pool of 
HCV-infected individuals would be maintained for the 
foreseeable future. At the same time, the availability of 
an effective HBV vaccine brings to light the challenges 
of distributing preventive medicines to underserved 
populations worldwide. A concerted international effort 
involving several research approaches, from molecular 
analysis to vaccine development to population studies to 
distribution infrastructure, is urgently needed.

diseases. Liver 16, 293–297 (1996).
This article shows telomere shortening during 
human chronic liver disease and the induction of 
liver cirrhosis. It also suggests that telomerase 
might be re-activated during the late stages of 
hepatocarcinogenesis as the telomere length of 
advanced HCCs is slightly longer than that of early￾stage HCCs, suggestive of telomerase activation.

The role of telomere dysfunction in HCC initiation 
and progression is addressed in this work. Whereas 
telomere dysfunction promotes liver cancer 
initiation in mice, it suppresses progression, 
therefore pointing to the importance of telomerase 
re-activation in HCC progression.
