Depression as a risk factor for adverse outcomes
in coronary heart disease
Kenneth E Freedland* and Robert M Carney
Abstract
Background: Depression is firmly established as an independent predictor of mortality and cardiac morbidity in
patients with coronary heart disease (CHD). However, it has been difficult to determine whether it is a causal risk
factor, and whether treatment of depression can improve cardiac outcomes. In addition, research on biobehavioral
mechanisms has not yet produced a definitive causal model of the relationship between depression and cardiac
outcomes.
Discussion: Key challenges in this line of research concern the measurement of depression, the definition and
relevance of certain subtypes of depression, the temporal relationship between depression and CHD, underlying
biobehavioral mechanisms, and depression treatment efficacy.
Summary: This article examines some of the methodological challenges that will have to be overcome in order to
determine whether depression should be regarded as a key target of secondary prevention in CHD.

Background
The past three decades of research have produced com￾pelling evidence that depression is a risk factor for morta￾lity and cardiac morbidity in patients with coronary heart
disease (CHD) [1-5]. Nevertheless, many questions about
this phenomenon have not yet been answered unequivo￾cally, and skeptics still have some legitimate grounds for
their skepticism.
The most important scientific questions about depres￾sion in patients with CHD are whether it is not just a risk
marker but a causal risk factor for adverse CHD outcomes
[6], and which biobehavioral mechanisms, among the
many that have been proposed, link depression to these
outcomes [7,8]. The most important clinical questions are
whether depression is modifiable (that is, treatable) in pa￾tients with CHD, and whether its treatment improves
cardiac event-free survival [9].
This article explains some of the principal reasons why
it has been difficult to answer these questions to a high
degree of certainty. It discusses methodological challenges,
observational research, randomized controlled trials
(RCTs), and other treatment-related research. It also high￾lights an interesting paradox that has recently emerged in
the treatment literature, and discusses its implication for
future research.
Discussion
Defining and measuring depression
Several long-standing controversies have surrounded the
definition and measurement of depression in patients
with CHD. The central question that drives these con￾troversies is whether features that resemble depression
represent ‘real’ depression in these patients. This ques￾tion is not exclusive to CHD; it also casts doubt on the
diagnostic validity of depression in the presence of other
chronic medical illnesses [10]. One of the reasons is that
some of the symptoms of depression are non-specific;
that is, they can also be symptoms of other disorders
[11]. Fatigue is a good example. In a patient with CHD,
it might be due to depression, but it could also be due to
CHD, medical comorbidities, side effects of medications,
or deconditioning. One way to handle non-specific
symptoms is to assume that they are not due to depres￾sion and to omit them from screening instruments and

diagnostic interviews [12]. This approach is problematic,
for several reasons. First, in many cases, these symptoms
may be due partially or entirely to depression, and it is
rarely possible to pinpoint their etiology. Second, there
are fairly strong correlations, even in medically ill patient
populations, between non-specific symptoms such as fa￾tigue and less ambiguous cognitive and emotional symp￾toms of depression such as dysphoric mood, feelings
of worthlessness, and excessive or inappropriate guilt
[13,14]. Finally, the American Psychiatric Association’s
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,
fourth edition (DSM-IV) criteria for depressive disorders
[15] indicate that features such as fatigue should be
counted as symptoms of depression unless they are ‘…due
to the direct physiological effects of a substance (for ex￾ample, a drug of abuse, a medication) or a general medical
condition (for example, hypothyroidism)’. In other words,
unless there is clear evidence that a symptom is entirely
due to the direct, physiological effects of a medical condi￾tion or medication, it should be counted towards the diag￾nosis of depression.
Giving the benefit of the doubt to non-specific symp￾toms may increase the risk of false positive diagnoses of
depression. However, the DSM-IV criteria for major de￾pression reduce this risk by requiring (1) the presence of
at least one cardinal symptom (dysphoric mood and/or
pervasive loss of interest or pleasure in usual activities)
plus four or five additional symptoms from a list of nine
distinguishing features of depression, (2) the symptoms
must be present most of the day nearly every day, (3) the
symptoms must have been present for at least 2 weeks,
and (4) there should be evidence that the symptoms are
causing distress and/or impairment in one or more do￾mains of daily functioning.
The cognitive and emotional symptoms of depression
in cardiac patients are sometimes disregarded as well,
but for a very different reason: The importance of these
symptoms is minimized because they are ‘understan￾dable’, as in, ‘Of course he’s feeling down, he just had a
heart attack’ [16]. This view is unjustified. If a depressive
episode is precipitated by a stressful event, regardless of
whether it is a myocardial infarction (MI) or any other
kind of adversity, it is still a depressive episode. Rela￾tively severe and/or persistent cases of depression are
clinically significant regardless of whether their etiology
is ‘understandable’ or obscure. In addition, it is a mis￾take to assume that if a patient is found to be depressed
after an adverse event such as an MI, the depression is
necessarily due to that event. Many patients have a
myocardial infarction during a depressive episode that
may have started weeks or months before the cardiac
event [17]. Furthermore, many patients start having de￾pressive episodes years or even decades before there are
any clinical manifestations of CHD [18].
These controversies would have succumbed long ago if
there were a definitive diagnostic test for depression or if
it were a monogenic disorder, but depression is a complex,
multifactorial condition, and there is no definitive labora￾tory test for it. The research in this area is further compli￾cated by a multiplicity of measures of depression. Some of
the most frequently used instruments are listed in Table 1.
The list is limited to measures that were recommended
for use in research on depression and CHD in a National
Heart, Lung, and Blood working group report, and that
have been used in multiple studies of cardiac patients [19].
In retrospective studies of large healthcare databases,
depression is typically defined by clinical diagnosis and/
or antidepressant prescriptions. Despite the fact that
these sorts of studies are plagued by classification errors,
some of them have found significant associations be￾tween depression and adverse outcomes in cardiac pa￾tients, for example [27,28].
In many prospective studies, depression has been mea￾sured by self-report questionnaires [17,29,30]. The total
score can be used to characterize the overall severity of
depressive symptoms. Cutoff scores can be used to differ￾entiate between non-depressed and depressed patients,
and scores in the depressed range may be subdivided into
mild, moderate, and severe levels of depression. Several
different questionnaires have been used to study depres￾sion in cardiac patients, despite the fact that there are
differences in their predictive values [31-34]. In other pro￾spective studies, depression is defined according to the
DSM-IV or International Classification of Diseases, ninth
revision (ICD-9) criteria for depressive disorders [35-37].
The symptoms of depressive disorders are usually evalu￾ated in these studies by a structured interview rather
than by a self-report questionnaire [35,36,38]. Some stu￾dies suggest that interview-based depression diagnoses
have greater predictive value than questionnaires vis-à-vis
cardiac outcomes; other studies suggest the opposite. The
jury is still out on this question, but it is clear that differ￾ences among measurement methods help to explain dif￾ferences among studies as to whether and how strongly
depression predicts cardiac outcomes [39,40].

Subtypes of depression
Depression is a polythetic syndrome in which different
patients present with different combinations of symptoms
[41]. For example, sleep disturbance is a prominent fea￾ture of depression in some cases but not in others [42].
The phenotypic complexity of depression has created
interest in the question of whether particular symptoms of
depression, or clusters of symptoms, are associated with a
higher risk of adverse cardiac outcomes than are other
symptoms or symptom clusters. Although there are a
number of different lines along which the syndrome of
depression has been carved, the cognitive/somatic distinc￾tion is the one that has gained the most attention in the
behavioral cardiology literature [43-48].
Research on the cognitive and somatic features of
depression in cardiac patients can be difficult to inter￾pret, for several reasons. First, there several different
ways to group or cluster these symptoms, including vari￾ous forms of statistical factor analysis and ‘face validity’
approaches. Different methods can and do result in dif￾ferent groupings [43-47,49-53]. Second, many studies
have shown that there is a moderately strong correlation
between the cognitive and the somatic symptoms of
depression, and that both sets of symptoms tend to rise
and fall along with the overall severity of depression.
The cognitive and somatic symptoms of depression are
probably manifestations of a single polythetic disorder,
not indicators of two distinctly different disorders
[13,14]. Finally, studies that have compared the predic￾tive values of cognitive and somatic symptoms have pro￾duced conflicting results. Some studies of patients with
coronary disease have shown that somatic symptoms are
better predictors of cardiac outcomes than are cognitive
symptoms, but other studies have not found this diffe￾rence [44,49,54]. Studies of other cardiac patient popula￾tions have increased the heterogeneity of the findings in
this area. For example, studies of depression after co￾ronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery shown that
cognitive symptoms are better predictors than are som￾atic symptoms, the very opposite of the pattern found in
some studies of post-acute coronary syndrome (ACS)
patients [55,56].
Time factors
Coronary atherosclerosis usually starts to develop long be￾fore it produces any clinical manifestations or requires
intervention. Its initial clinical presentation is often lethal,
and relatively little is known about the role of depression
in these cases. Thus, most of what we know about the ef￾fect of depression on cardiac outcomes is based on studies
of patients who have survived the clinical onset of CHD.
Whether the strength of the effect of depression differs
between patients who survive the onset of CHD and those
who do not is very difficult to study.
Initial, non-lethal presentations of coronary disease
come in a variety of forms, including discovery via rou￾tine testing, exertional angina, unstable angina, acute
MI, and others, and they may or may not require coronary
revascularization via percutaneous intervention (PCI) or
CABG surgery. Some depression studies enroll patients
after a particular kind of initial presentation, such as after
an acute MI. Other studies are more inclusive and enroll
patients who began their cardiac careers in a variety of
different ways. In some studies, depression is assessed
shortly (for example, within 1 month) after one of these
initial cardiac events. In other studies, the first assess￾ment of depression occurs long after (for example, 3 to
6 months) the initial cardiac event. In still other studies,
the first assessment of depression may not follow the
initial cardiac event, at least not in every case. For ex￾ample, in a study of depression in patients with ‘stable
CHD, some of the patients may have no history of acute ’
MI, others may have had only one MI, and still others may
have had multiple MIs.
Depression is a complex condition in terms of its tim￾ing. General population studies (for example, [50]) have
found that typically, the first episode of major depression
occurs in childhood, adolescence, or young adulthood,
but that in some cases, it occurs in middle or old age.
The chronicity of major depressive episodes is also highly
variable; they typically last a few weeks or months, but
some last for years. In addition, there are substantial
differences in the number of depressive episodes that in￾dividuals experience over their lifetime. Whereas some
people have an initial episode and never have another,
others go on to have multiple episodes [57,58]. The num￾ber of episodes an individual has had depends, in part, on
the age at which he or she is assessed. Since the initial
clinical presentation of CHD usually occurs after age 50,
many patients have had one or more prior episodes of
depression by the time they are enrolled in a study,
whether or not they happen to be depressed at the time of
enrollment.
It is often difficult for patients to give a reliable, accurate
description of their current or recent depression symp￾toms. A patient might remember having felt fatigued
recently, but be unable to accurately recall when it started
or how frequently it has been present over the past 2
weeks. It can be even more difficult to remember depres￾sive episodes that occurred years or even decades ago, and
patient’s recall of such remote events can be biased by
many different factors, including their current mood state
and medical condition. This can be especially problematic
when patients are assessed shortly after a stressful cardiac
event, for example, while hospitalized for an acute MI
[59,60]. Inaccurate recall and reporting biases may con￾tribute to the broader problem of underdiagnosis of
depression in patients with heart disease [11,61,62].
Freedland and Carney BMC Medicine 2013, 11:131 Page 3 of 9
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7015/11/131

All of these factors make it difficult to pinpoint the
temporal relationship between depression and CHD.
Both conditions are ‘moving targets’, and it can be diffi￾cult for patients to remember and report relevant details.
This is unfortunate because the temporal relationship
between these two conditions is important, for a variety
of reasons. One is that in some prospective studies,
depression is assessed only once (for example, after an
acute MI), but recurrent cardiac events and deaths are
ascertained over a follow-up period of up to several
years. If depression predicts cardiac outcomes in such a
study, it is not clear whether lasting harm was caused by
the depressive episode that occurred around the index
event. An alternative possibility is that the patients who
were depressed at that time also tend to be depressed at
other times during the follow-up. It may be that depres￾sion only poses a risk if it is present around the time of
a recurrent cardiac event, and not only around the time
of the index event. There is no way to differentiate
between these possibilities in studies that only assess de￾pressed after the index event.
In other prospective studies, depression is assessed
periodically during the follow-up period. This is an im￾provement over single assessments. However, if depres￾sion is measured at very wide intervals (for example,
once a year), most of the cardiac events will occur
between measurements. Consequently, there will still be
uncertainty as to whether patients are at risk for recu￾rrent cardiac events only during depressive episodes, or
if they remain at increased risk after or between depre￾ssive episodes.
The temporal relationship between depression and
CHD may be important for other reasons as well. For
example, some studies suggest that patients who have
their first ever depressive episode around the time of an
acute MI are at higher risk for adverse outcomes than
are patients who are equally depressed but who have
also had prior episodes of depression [18,63]. It could
be, however, that among currently depressed MI pa￾tients, the ones who are at the highest risk are also hap￾pen to be the most likely to forget that they have had
previous episodes of depression. Another possibility is
that vascular disease may contribute both to cardiovas￾cular events and to late-life depression [64,65]. As an￾other example, some studies suggest that the prognostic
importance of a depressive episode depends on whether
its onset precedes or follows an acute coronary event
[66]. Biased recall is a significant challenge in these stud￾ies, since the assessment of depression invariably occurs
only after the index cardiac event.
Causal models and mechanisms
If depression predicts worse outcomes in patients with
CHD (and the evidence strongly suggests that it does),
then it is important to find out why. What connects
these two very different conditions with one another?
Different causal models of the relationship between
depression and CHD give rise to interest in different
mechanisms. The model that has captivated most of the
researchers in this field posits that depression plays a
causal role in adverse cardiac outcomes. In this model,
the adverse effects of depression on cardiac outcomes
may be mediated by behavioral factors, biological fac￾tors, or both. The leading candidates on the behavioral
side are factors such as physical inactivity [67], smoking
[68], and non-compliance with cardiac medications
[69-72]. On the biological side, the candidates that have
received the most attention are cardiovascular auto￾nomic dysregulation [73-75] and inflammation [76-83].
Depression is associated with all of these phenomena.
On average, for example, depressed patients tend to have
higher resting heart rates and lower heart rate variability
than otherwise similar non-depressed patients. They are
also more likely to smoke and less likely to engage in
regular exercise and take their cardiac medications as
prescribed. The addition of these factors to survival ana￾lysis models often attenuates the effect of depression on
cardiac event-free survival. Thus, they might turn out to
be the mechanistic linkages that explain why depressed
cardiac patients are at higher risk of adverse outcomes.
The expense and practical difficulty of measuring some
of these biobehavioral factors, especially in large studies
with lengthy follow-up periods, has impeded progress
toward a definitive mechanistic model [8].
An alternative causal model posits that comorbid de￾pression in CHD is caused by the heart disease [84].
This model assumes that the apparent effect of depres￾sion on cardiac outcomes is an epiphenomenon, that is,
the patients with the most severe cases of CHD tend to
have the worst outcomes and tend to be the ones who
get depressed. The discussion of time factors (above)
provides some reasons to question the premise that de￾pression in patients with CHD is necessarily due to their
CHD. Nevertheless, it remains possible that the patients
who are the most severely depressed also tend to be the
ones with the most severe CHD [4].
There are a number of ways to characterize the ana￾tomical or pathophysiological severity of various aspects
of CHD. For example, some studies have used Gensini
scores to characterize the number of stenotic coronary
artery segments, or cardiac enzyme levels to measure
the severity of acute MI. Few studies have found that
these sorts of measures correlate very strongly (if at all)
with the presence or severity of depression in patients
with CHD. In addition, quite a few prognostic studies
have controlled for these indicators and have neverthe￾less found significant associations between depression
and cardiac outcomes [2,39,85].
Freedland and Carney BMC Medicine 2013, 11:131 Page 4 of 9
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7015/11/131

However, measures of the symptomatic or functional
severity of heart disease do correlate with depression
[86-89], and there is substantial evidence that depres￾sion contributes to functional impairment and lowers
symptom-reporting thresholds, both in CHD and in
other patient populations as well [90,91]. Thus, control￾ling for indicators of the symptomatic or functional
severity of heart disease creates a ‘chicken and egg’
problem, and thereby contributes little to our under￾standing of the causal relationship between depression
and adverse cardiac outcomes.
A third causal model posits that the association be￾tween depression and CHD is due to shared heritability.
Studies that have tested this model have found evidence
of shared heritability [84,92,93]. However, there is also
evidence that among twins at high genetic risk for both
disorders, the risk of developing ischemic heart disease
is significantly higher in those with than without pheno￾typic expression of depression [94]. This suggests that
both shared genetic liability and exposure to depression
play a role, and that the relationship between depression
and CHD is not an epiphenomenon.
These models are not mutually exclusive. The burden of
CHD (along with other chronic illnesses that are common
in patients with CHD) may promote depression, exposure
to depression may promote adverse cardiac outcomes,
and shared genetic factors may predispose some indivi￾duals to both conditions.
Treatment research
Two complementary goals have motivated research on
the treatment of depression in patients with CHD. One
is to identify treatments that are both safe and effective
for depression in this patient population, and the other
is to determine whether effective treatment of depres￾sion improves cardiac outcomes. The latter goal has
pragmatic implications for clinical care, but it also im￾portant with respect to the question of whether depres￾sion plays a causal role in adverse cardiac outcomes.
Cardiac patients were seldom treated for depression
prior to the development of selective serotonin reuptake
inhibitors (SSRIs), because (among other reasons) the
only antidepressants that were available at the time were
cardiotoxic. Most of the recent studies of antidepressant
medications for depression in cardiac patients have eval￾uated SSRIs such as sertraline or citalopram. The weight
of the available evidence indicates that these agents are
relatively safe for patients with CHD but that their effi￾cacy is less than impressive [95-99].
The Sertraline Antidepressant Heart Attack Random￾ized Trial (SADHART) was one of the largest and most
rigorous studies in this area. A total of 369 patients with
major depression were enrolled within 1 month of an
acute coronary event and randomly assigned to receive
sertraline or placebo for 24 weeks. The safety results were
favorable, but post-treatment scores on the Hamilton Rat￾ing Scale for Depression (HRSD) did not differ between
the groups. There were significant differences on the
HRSD within the subgroup of patients with severe depre￾ssion, as defined by a HRSD score of 18 or higher at
baseline, but not in the patients with less severe major de￾pression. Even in the severe subgroup, the post-treatment
HRSD scores of the sertraline and placebo groups differed
by less than 3 points [95].
Trials that have tested psychotherapeutic interven￾tions, or combinations of psychotherapy and medication,
have also produced mixed results. The Enhancing Re￾covery in Coronary Heart Disease (ENRICHD) study is
the largest trial to date in this area. A total of 2,481
patients were recruited within 1 month of an acute MI
and met the study’s criteria for depression (n = 978), low
perceived social support (n = 647), or both (n = 856).
(Low perceived social support was an eligibility criterion
for ENRICHD because, like depression, it increases the
risk of adverse cardiac outcomes). The participants were
randomly assigned to cognitive behavior therapy (CBT)
or to usual care (UC). Some patients in the intervention
arm received sertraline in addition to CBT. The inter￾vention was superior to usual care for depression among
the depressed participants, but the effect was modest; on
average, the groups differed by less than 2 points on the
HRSD and less than 3 points on the Beck Depression
Inventory (BDI). The intervention also had statistically
significant but small effects on social support among the
participants who had low perceived social support at en￾rollment [100].
There was no difference between the treatment and
control groups in cardiac event-free survival. How￾ever, ENRICHD provided a weak test of the causal
risk factor hypothesis because the ENRICHD inter￾vention had weak effects on depression and social
support. It will not be possible to conduct a much
stronger test of this hypothesis until more effective
interventions for depression are developed. There has
been some progress toward this objective [101], but
we may have to wait a few more years for a rigorous,
randomized, controlled test of the hypothesis that de￾pression is a modifiable, causal risk factor for adverse
cardiac outcomes in patients with CHD.
Several trials that have produced disappointing pri￾mary results have turned out to be very informative in
an unexpected way. Secondary analyses of these trials
have revealed that patients who remain depressed des￾pite aggressive treatment are at significantly higher risk
for adverse cardiac outcomes than are patients who do
respond to treatment. Treatment-resistant depression
appears to be a particularly high-risk form of depression
in patients with CHD, and a more robust predictor of
Freedland and Carney BMC Medicine 2013, 11:131 Page 5 of 9

adverse cardiac outcomes than other subtypes, such as
depression with salient somatic symptoms [9].
This line of research has been productive, but its im￾plications are disconcerting. As discussed above, the
overarching goal of this entire area of research has been
to determine whether depression is both modifiable and
causally related to adverse cardiac outcomes. Treatment￾resistant depression may be a causal risk factor for
cardiac morbidity and mortality, but until we find more
treatments that are efficacious this form of depression is
clearly not modifiable. Treatment-resistant depression is
a common problem both in otherwise medically well
psychiatric patients and in patients with chronic medical
comorbidities. However, coronary disease and other med￾ical comorbidities may contribute to depression treatment
resistance [102,103]. The Sequenced Treatment Alterna￾tives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) trial and other re￾cent studies have shown that stepped care algorithms
and non-pharmacological interventions can improve de￾pression in many cases that do not respond to first-line
treatments, but that complete remission of depression is
an elusive goal in many of these cases [104-107]. Identi￾fication of more efficacious interventions for treatment￾resistant depression is a high priority for research on
depression in general, and in patients with coronary
disease in particular.
Summary
Numerous studies and meta-analyses have shown that
depression is a robust predictor of adverse outcomes in
CHD. However, it has been difficult to determine whether
depression plays a causal role in these outcomes, as well
as the biobehavioral pathways that link depression to
cardiac morbidity and mortality. It has also been difficult
to determine whether effective treatment of depression
can improve cardiac outcomes, primarily because highly
effective treatments are not yet available. Depression is a
common comorbid condition in CHD, and there is grow￾ing recognition of the harm it can cause. It is difficult to
answer some of the key questions about depression in pa￾tients with CHD, but it is worth the effort to try. Further
research is needed to identify significant moderators of
depression treatment outcomes, and to develop efficacious
interventions for treatment-resistant depression. Such
studies could improve the clinical care of patients with
CHD, while helping to resolve the question of whether
depression is a causal risk factor for cardiovascular mor￾bidity and mortality in these patients.
