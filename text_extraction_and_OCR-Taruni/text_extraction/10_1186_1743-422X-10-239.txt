Medical Virology of Hepatitis B: how it began and
where we are now
Wolfram H Gerlich
Abstract
Infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) may lead to acute or chronic hepatitis. HBV infections were previously much
more frequent but there are still 240 million chronic HBV carriers today and ca. 620,000 die per year from the late
sequelae liver cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma. Hepatitis B was recognized as a disease in ancient times, but its
etiologic agent was only recently identified. The first clue in unraveling this mystery was the discovery of an
enigmatic serum protein named Australia antigen 50 years ago by Baruch Blumberg. Some years later this was
recognized to be the HBV surface antigen (HBsAg). Detection of HBsAg allowed for the first time screening of
inapparently infected blood donors for a dangerous pathogen. The need to diagnose clinically silent HBV infections
was a strong driving force in the development of modern virus diagnostics. HBsAg was the first infection marker to
be assayed with a highly sensitive radio immune assay. HBV itself was among the first viruses to be detected by
assay of its DNA genome and IgM antibodies against the HBV core antigen were the first to be selectively detected
by the anti-μ capture assay. The cloning and sequencing of the HBV genome in 1978 paved the way to understand
the viral life cycle, and allowed development of efficient vaccines and drugs. Today’s hepatitis B vaccine was the
first vaccine produced by gene technology. Among the problems that still remain today are the inability to achieve
a complete cure of chronic HBV infections, the recognition of occult HBV infections, their potential reactivation and
the incomplete protection against escape mutants and heterologous HBV genotypes by HBV vaccines.

Introductory remark
The history of modern research on viral hepatitis began in
the year 1963, when Nobel Prize winner Baruch S.
Blumberg (1925–2011) reported for the first time publicly
on the discovery of a new antigen named Australia antigen
(AuAg) (reference [1], page 82). In the years following,
AuAg would become the first specific marker of viral hepa￾titis. Thereafter, viral hepatitis type B became a driving
force for the development of modern virus diagnostics and
vaccines. This article will recapitulate the major advances
in the field of hepatitis B research throughout the last 50
years and point out some perspectives for future research.
Early methods of virology
Virus detection
In the 1960s, virology was still a young science, primarily
dedicated to basic research. Its clinical relevance was
limited. While scientists had been successful in propagat￾ing viruses of many major infections in cell cultures, these
techniques were suboptimal for diagnosis of most viral
diseases. It usually took a long time for the cytopathic ef￾fect of virus growth to become evident in cell culture, and
many virus strains were only able to grow in the artificial
host cell systems after a protracted adaptation. In addition,
there were many viruses that did not generate any cyto￾pathic effect, and could therefore not be recognized even
if virus replication did occur. Occasionally, observing the
viral material with an electron microscope or using certain
biological methods, e.g. hemagglutination, were helpful in
such cases. These methods of virus detection enabled the
development of vaccines, but for clinical diagnostics on an
individual basis they were too time-consuming, too diffi￾cult, or unsuitable.
Detection of antiviral antibodies
As an alternative approach, detection of antibodies which
the patients had produced against the antigens of the

disease-causing agents was adopted as a diagnostic method.
However, this approach was problematic as it depended
upon detection of the reaction of the patient’s antibodies
with the viral antigen. The method most often used was
the quite difficult complement fixation reaction (CFR),
which was originally developed for diagnosing syphilis. In
addition to the human patient serum, and the viral antigen
(e.g. from infected chicken embryos or tissue cultures), one
needs sheep erythrocytes as indicator cells, rabbit anti￾bodies against the sheep erythrocytes for generating an im￾mune complex on the erythrocyte membrane and, finally,
complement (usually from guinea pigs) for the CFR. Com￾plement is a multi-protein complex in animal sera that
binds to immune complexes. When assembled and acti￾vated on cell membranes, holes are punched in the cells by
the complement, which leads to lysis of the cells. If the pa￾tient serum does not contain antibodies, the complement
lyses the erythrocytes, and the non-transparent red reaction
mix becomes a transparent red. If immune complexes were
formed previously in the mix of patient serum and viral
antigen, these bind the complement away, such that it no
longer can lyse the erythrocytes. CFR requires four complex
biological component mixtures from four different animal
species and these mixtures must all be standardized quanti￾tatively by the individual lab.
One qualitative CFR result was usually not sufficient,
since the antibodies detected could have come from a pre￾vious, unrecognized infection and not from the current ill￾ness. For diagnosis of highly prevalent acute infections one
had to demonstrate an increase in antibody titers. To
achieve this a first sample was required, which should have
been taken as soon as possible after the start of the illness,
followed by a second serum sample from the patient, at
least one week later that had to contain a significantly
higher amount of antibodies against the corresponding
virus. Quantification of CFRs and similar biological reac￾tions was only possible by diluting patient sera serially in
steps of two and determining the highest dilution that had
just given a positive result. Only a titer increase of at least
a factor of 4 could be rated as significant. Early virus diag￾nostics therefore had to use complicated methods which
are almost forgotten today. However, the virologists of the
1960’s would have been happy to have these methods
available for diagnosing viral hepatitis.
Early recognition of viral hepatitis
The infectious nature of the disease had already been
recognized in the early days of medical microbiology, in
1885 by Lürmann during an “icterus epidemic” which
occurred after a small pox vaccination campaign. The
vaccine had been made from human “lymph” (probably
obtained from the vaccine-induced lesions in other vacci￾nated persons) [2]. Furthermore, addition of human serum
to vaccines was not unusual at that time and e.g. considered
necessary to stabilize yellow fever vaccine. Several out￾breaks of hepatitis were observed in recipients of yellow
fever vaccine [3], the largest in 1942 among U.S. American
Army personnel with 50,000 clinical cases. Retrospective
analysis showed that the outbreak was caused by hepatitis
B virus (HBV) with probably 280,000 additional unrec￾ognized infections [4]. Epidemiological observations in the
first half of the last century pointed to at least two types of
sub-cellular pathogens: Type A mainly affected children,
was spread at often epidemic levels via food or drinking
water contaminated with feces and was never chronic. Type
B was often transmitted through medical interventions in
which human blood or serum was intentionally or, due to a
lack of hygiene, accidentally injected or inoculated from
one person to the next [3]. The most serious problem of
blood transfusion was that even a blood donor in appar￾ently perfect health, who had never had jaundice, could
transmit the disease to the recipient and that the recipients
often developed severe acute or chronic hepatitis.
Human experimentation
All attempts to identify the pathogen were unsuccessful
for more than eighty years. The problem with viral hepa￾titis was so big that there was even human experimenta￾tion done at several places before and during World
War II [3], and among so-called volunteer participants
who were, in fact, prisoners in the 1950’s in the USA [5].
Even more ethically problematic were the studies in a
large number of mentally handicapped children carried
out until 1970. Using targeted infection, New York pedi￾atrician Saul Krugman showed 1967 that there were
indeed two separate pathogens causing hepatitis [6]. How￾ever, even this experimentation - unimaginable by today’s
ethical standards - did not lead to the urgently needed
break-through.
Discovery of Australia antigen
Search for genetic markers
The first hint came from an unexpected source. American
physician and geneticist Baruch Blumberg wanted to study
genetic markers for susceptibility to certain illnesses, espe￾cially cancer, and had gathered serum samples world-wide
from a wide variety of ethnic sources in the 1950′s and
60′s. The possibilities for recognizing genetic differences
with laboratory methods were very limited at that time.
Blumberg used an immunological approach. He postulated
that people, who had received blood products from a large
number of donors, e.g. due to hemophilia, would have de￾veloped antibodies against “polymorphic” serum proteins.
These are proteins that show small genetic differences
from person to person in the amino acid sequence, and
may be recognized as foreign to the body of the recipient
after a transfusion. Blumberg’s co-worker, Harvey Alter,
did indeed discover a new antigen in several samples of the

huge serum collection, quite often in Australian aborigines,
for whom the Australia Antigen (AuAg) was named.
Relation to hepatitis B
At first, Blumberg believed that AuAg was indeed a poly￾morphic serum protein like the lipoprotein antigen which
he had discovered before. But soon the evidence accumu￾lated that it might have something to do with hepatitis,
which Blumberg first revealed in a publication in 1967 [1],
page 100. Parallel to that, Alfred Prince (New York Blood
Center) was specifically looking for a “serum hepatitis
(SH) antigen” in the blood of hepatitis B patients and
reported on it in 1968, but soon he realized that it was
identical to AuAg [7]. Subsequently, various groups con￾firmed that Au/SH-Ag was actually a marker for acute or
chronic hepatitis B and that there were apparently healthy
Au/SHAg carriers.
Screening for infectious blood donors
A way had been found to recognize infectious blood dona￾tions and to sort them out. Blumberg used the agar gel
double diffusion developed by Ouchterlony in the discovery
of AuAg. Compared to the biochemical methods of protein
determination, the Ouchterlony method was fairly sensitive
and specific and compared to CFR, it was also technically
simple. For infection diagnostics, however, the test was in
most cases not sensitive enough. Although blood donation
facilities were soon examining all of their donors for AuAg,
many post-transfusion hepatitis B infections continued to
appear. Thus, the agar gel diffusion and similar methods
were only a temporary solution, and the breakthrough
came shortly thereafter.
Development of the first radioimmunoassay (RIA)
for an infectious agent
Chemical labeling of antibodies
In 1972, a team including biochemists Lacy Overby,
Ghung-Mei Ling and Richard Decker at Abbott Labora￾tories (North Chicago) developed a new testing principle
for highly-sensitive detection of antigens or antibodies, the
solid-phase sandwich radioimmunoassay named Ausria
125 [8]. The test combined the specificity of the bio￾logical antigen-antibody interaction with the high sensi￾tivity of modern physicochemical analytical methods.
Proteins can be covalently coupled with many physic￾ally detectable components. Even before 1972, it was
possible to couple e.g. fluorescent molecules to antibodies.
Antibodies visible under UV light were specifically used in
the recognition of viral and other causal agents in micro￾scopic tissue preparations (immunofluorescence), and –
conversely – fluorescently marked animal antibodies against
human antibodies could be used to determine whether a
patient serum contained antibodies against a pathogen￾specific antibody under the microscope. For viral hepatitis,
however, there were no susceptible tissue cultures. One part
of this new test took up the newly developed technique of
labeling antigens or antibodies with radioactive substances
such as iodine-125 which had already facilitated e.g. the de￾tection of insulin and other small molecules by biophysical
techniques.
Solid phase sandwich assay
The completely new aspect was the binding of one com￾ponent in the test system, here the unlabeled AuAg anti￾body, by simple adsorption to a surface (solid-phase),
and then allowing the analyte in the patient serum, here
the AuAg, to specifically bind to that coated surface.
The specific binding of the AuAg to the solid phase was
thereafter detected by the binding of the Iodine-125 la￾beled AuAg antibody. Since one AuAg particle contains
about 100 binding sites for the antibodies, it was pos￾sible for the AuAg to bind first to the solid phase and, in
a second step, many molecules of radioactively labeled
AuAg antibodies. Non-bound antibodies just had to be
thoroughly washed away, and the amount of radioactive
iodine 125 on the solid phase (at the time, a plastic
bead) was measured. Since radioactivity can be detected
with very high sensitivity, the process opened new di￾mensions in detection sensitivity that could be pushed
from several micrograms/ml to a few nanograms/ml
AuAg. In addition, the subjective visual reading of a re￾action result was replaced by an objective, quantitative
measurement method. The new test was a breakthrough
for the screening of blood donors and for the diagnosis
of viral hepatitis and was very rapidly introduced into
clinical practice.
Discovery of the hepatitis B virus particle (HBV)
AuAg - an infection marker
In 1970, it was unclear exactly what AuAg was. Was it a
host protein formed as a reaction to a pathogen causing
hepatitis, was it a component of the pathogen, or was it
possibly the pathogen itself? These questions were not
simple to answer, since HBV or AuAg could still not be
propagated in cell cultures or laboratory animals. In 1971,
a first clue was the discovery by Le Bouvier of the AuAg
subtypes with antigen determinants d or y, which appear
mutually exclusive in addition to the common determin￾ant a [9]. Soon after, Bancroft identified the mutually ex￾clusive determinants w or r [10]. Within an infection
chain, the AuAg subtype always remained the same, which
was an argument against the host protein hypothesis and
for the pathogen theory.
Unusual structure of Australia antigen
Under the electron microscope (EM), purified AuAg
appeared as small round particles which, unlike viruses,
were of variable sizes between 17–25 nm [1], page 108.

Most importantly, Blumberg and his team came to the
conclusion that these particles did not contain any nucleic
acid. Their experimental approach was a bit questionable
from today’s ethical standards, but not comparable to
Krugman’s experiments. They injected 1 millicurie radio￾active 32P-phosphate as a biochemical precursor for newly
synthesized DNA to a terminally ill HBsAg carrier, ob￾tained 250 ml HBsAg containing plasma after one day,
purified the HBsAg and followed the distribution of 32P in
a density gradient. The purified HBsAg particles contained
a small amount of 32P, but with phenol extraction it did
not remain in the aqueous phase as did nucleic acids but
went into the protein/lipid containing phenol phase [11].
In retrospect it is apparent that the conclusion was correct
but the experiment was inconclusive, because the nucleic
acid of HBV is covalently linked to a protein and is there￾fore extracted to the phenol phase. Independently, the
author showed that the ultraviolet-spectrum of purified
HBsAg was that of pure protein and not that of a nucleo￾protein [12]. These findings were incompatible with the
nature of viruses. Blumberg was at that time, however, so
convinced that AuAg was an infectious hepatitis pathogen
that he postulated for a while a novel nucleic acid-free in￾fection principle that he named ICRON after the Institute
for Cancer Research in Philadelphia where he worked at
that time [1], page 109. The hypothesis was already formu￾lated by J. S. Griffith [13] that the pathogen of a spongi￾form encephalopathy (scrapie in sheep) was infectious but
would not have any nucleic acid, which Stanley Prusiner
was later able to prove with his prion theory.
Discovery of the Dane particle
AuAg, however, was not a prion-like agent. While in￾specting AuAg immune complexes under the EM in 1970,
David S. Dane (London) discovered that AuAg appeared
not only on the small pleomorphic particles, but also on
larger, virus-like objects 42 nm in size with a clearly visible
inner core [14]. Shortly thereafter, in 1971, his British col￾league June Almeida was able to release the core particles
from the so-called “Dane particles” by treatment with mild
detergent, and showed by immune EM that hepatitis B
(HB) patients formed antibodies (anti-HBc) against this
core antigen (HBcAg) [15]. This strongly suggested that
the Dane particles were the actual virus causing hepatitis
B. AuAg was obviously the surface antigen of the virus en￾velope, and was named HBsAg (s for surface) thereafter.
The infected hepatocyte forms the HBsAg protein in large
surplus and secretes it in addition to the complete virus
as round or filamentous noninfectious particles of about
20 nm in diameter into the blood leading to an approxi￾mately three-thousand fold excess of these subviral parti￾cles (Figures 1 and 2). This was the reason that the Dane
particles could not be recognized in AuAg preparations
purified by ultracentrifugation or size chromatography.
Discovery of HBV DNA
Since the HBV still could not be grown in cell cultures or
in practical laboratory animals, and patient sera contained
no more than few nanograms (ng) of Dane particles/ml
at most, a direct biochemical detection of the nucleic
acid within HBV was not possible at that time. Several re￾searchers tried to identify the HBV genome by indirect
methods. Shalom Hirschman (New York) claimed in 1971
that purified AuAg preparations would contain a reverse
transcriptase like retroviruses, i.e. a DNA polymerase
which accepts exogenously added RNA templates [17]. Al￾though this exciting publication could not be confirmed, it
opened the route to the detection of the HBV genome.
When trying to reproduce that report, in 1973 William
S. Robinson (Stanford, California) was indeed able to de￾tect an endogenous DNA polymerase activity within HBV
[18] and, in 1974, he identified the product of that activity

itself – the viral DNA [19]. One feature of HBV helped
with the recognition of its DNA even without the tech￾niques of molecular biology available today. The DNA
within the core particle is, in principle, double-stranded.
However, the viral DNA polymerase does not finish syn￾thesizing one strand before the virus is released into the
bloodstream. There, it lacks the nucleotide triphosphates
which are the building blocks for further DNA synthesis,
such that there remains a single-stranded gap in the viral
DNA (Figure 3). If one provides those building blocks in
the test tube, the synthesis restarts in the form of an en￾dogenous DNA polymerase reaction (i.e. without externally
added nucleic acid template), and if the nucleotide triphos￾phates are radioactively labeled this process can not only
be detected, but the viral DNA could also be characterized
as a small open circular DNA with ca. 3200 bases. In view
of these findings, it was generally believed that Dane parti￾cles were viruses, but Robinson himself insisted that it
would be first necessary to prove that the DNA would en￾code the viral proteins and infectious HBV. He planned to
clone the small amounts of available viral DNA in E. coli
with the then-newly developed methods in molecular biol￾ogy. But he was not allowed to do this because of safety
concerns about genetically altered organisms which had
been raised at the famous conference of Asilomar [20].
Cloning of HBV DNA
Some years later, around 1978, cloning and sequencing
of the HBV DNA was reported almost simultaneously by
three other pioneers in molecular biology and their teams
who had a biosafety laboratory: Pierre Tiollais (Paris) [21],
William Rutter (San Francisco) [22] and Kenneth Murray
(Edinburgh, 1930–2013) [23]. The cloned DNA was shown
to be indeed circular and to encode the genes for HBsAg,
HBcAg, the putative endogenous DNA polymerase and an
unexpected X gene (Figure 4). Thus, the cloned DNA was
most likely a true copy of the virus genome. The cloning
opened the way to manufacturing HBV DNA, HBsAg and
HBcAg in almost unlimited amounts using gene technol￾ogy, instead of painstakingly extracting it from the scarce
and highly-infectious patient material. This was important,
since these three materials would be used soon in large
amounts for diagnostics and vaccine development.
Final proof that the Dane particle is the HBV in the
sense of Robert Koch’s postulates came from an elegant
animal experiment conducted by the German
researchers Friedrich Deinhardt (1926–1992), Heinz
Schaller (1932–2010) and their colleagues published
1982 in Nature with Hans Will as first author [25].
While it was still not possible to reliably infect cell cul￾tures with HBV, experimental injection of cloned HBV
DNA into livers of chimpanzees initiated highly efficient
replication of HBV and even acute hepatitis B.
Serological diagnosis of HBV infections
The introduction of Ausria-125 was the beginning of an
impressive development in virus diagnostics; however
the test had one major disadvantage: the radioactivity
caused significant difficulties in the normal diagnostic la￾boratory. It was therefore a big step forward when it be￾came possible to label the antibodies used with enzymes,
and later with chemiluminescence-generating groups.
The test principle of the solid-phase sandwich immuno￾assays has been maintained to the present, however, for
assay of numerous antigens and antibodies in many fields
of biomedicine, even if the forms of the solid-phase and
the signal generation have changed.
The assay of HBsAg was soon complemented by the de￾tection of antibodies against HBsAg (anti-HBs) and HBcAg
(anti-HBc). Typically, anti-HBc appears with the onset of
acute hepatitis or after an unnoticed clinically silent HBV
infection event. If HBsAg is found without anti-HBc, the
patient can still develop hepatitis. If the HBV infection is
completely under immune control, the HBsAg disappears,

in the negative staining the outer preS1 and preS2 domains were not visible. 52 nm is the hydrodynamic diameter (Ch. Schüttler and W. Gerlich, unpublished)
and also measured by cryo-EM as the outer diameter [16], suppl. Figure 2. HBsAg protein comes in three forms: large (L-) HBs protein with the preS1, preS2 and
S domain, middle protein (M-) without preS1 and SHBs without preS1 and preS2.

but the anti-HBc remains and anti-HBs usually appears
as a sign of immunity. If the infection becomes chronic,
HBsAg and anti-HBc remain positive (Figure 5). With these
three HBV markers, it was possible to establish the infec￾tion or immunity status of a person in routine diagnostics
since the early 1980s.
Significance of anti-HBs
The very high anti-HBs concentration necessary for a posi￾tive reaction with HBsAg in the Ouchterlony technique (as
used by Blumberg) was an exception occurring only after re￾peated exposure to HBsAg. This happened before 1972 in
frequently transfused persons as in the case of hemophiliacs.
Figure 3 Biochemical structure of HBV DNA. The molecule is open circular. The minus-strand has full length within the core particle and even a
redundancy of 9 bases at the ends around the nick. The plus-strand is incomplete leaving a large single-stranded gap. The 5′ end of the minus-strand is
covalently linked to the primase domain of the DNA polymerase which is present with its active center of the reverse transcriptase domain at the 3′ end of
the plus-strand. The 5′ end of the plus-strand contains still its primer which is - in this case- derived from the 18 capped 5′ terminal bases of the degraded
pregenomic HBV mRNA.

For detection of naturally acquired anti-HBs after HBV in￾fection, the Ouchterlony or other antibody tests such as
CFR were not sufficiently sensitive, and a feasible HBV
neutralization test was not available. Abbott put the first ad￾equate test for anti-HBs on the market in 1975, which was
still a solid phase RIA with Iodine 125-labeled-HBsAg as a
reagent. The test was hugely important for the development
and licensing of the hepatitis B vaccine, the origins of which
went back to a patent of Blumberg in 1970 [1], page 134–
146. According to his idea, the first generation of HB vac￾cines contained purified HBsAg 20 nm-particles from HBV
carriers. Successful immunization was and is proven by the
detectable presence of anti-HBs. Furthermore, complete re￾covery from acute or chronic hepatitis B is best demon￾strated by a positive anti-HBs result.
Significance of anti-HBc
The landmark result of Almeida on the development of
anti-HBc during acute hepatitis B was soon confirmed
by others, in particular by Jay Hoofnagle [26]. The first
experimental tests in the 1970s, including CFR, used
HBcAg from infected liver or from Dane particles as
antigen, but later “recombinant” HBcAg produced in E.
coli [23] or yeast was used. In the author’s experience, the
natural HBcAg yielded highly specific results, but the re￾sults obtained with the more readily available recombinant
HBcAg from E. coli suffered from a certain degree of non￾specificity which remains a problem to the present. In
1982, the first commercial anti-HBc test was released as
an enzyme immunoassay. Anti-HBc had, in years follow￾ing, transiently gained significance as a surrogate test in
blood donors for hepatitis C infection which could not yet
be diagnosed, and also - transiently - for HIV, because of
the partially overlapping transmission pathways of HBV,
HCV and HIV.
Since anti-HBc neither proves active infection nor im￾munity, it could be considered clinically unnecessary
except for epidemiological studies or confirmatory test￾ing. However, anti-HBc does not only provide evidence
of prior infections, but also of an ongoing, occult HBV

HBV DNA. The HBV core contains besides the HBV genome the HBV polymerase with the primase (pr) and the reverse transcriptase (RT) domain
and the cellular protein kinase C alpha (PKC) [24]. Note the two start codons in the PreC/core ORF and the three start codons in the HBs ORF.
Figure 5 Schematic representation of the course of acute HBV
infections with resolution. After the infecting event (time 0)
follows a lag phase of several weeks without detectable markers.
Thereafter HBV DNA (within the virus) and HBsAg increase
exponentially in the serum. HBV DNA is detected earlier because its
assay is much more sensitive. The peak of HBV DNA and HBsAg is
reached before outbreak of the acute disease and both decrease
after the onset of clinical symptoms. Initially, the HBV DNA decreases
faster because it has a shorter half life time in serum than HBsAg.
HBsAg finally disappears whereas HBV DNA may remain detectable
in traces. Antibodies against the HBV core antigen (anti-HBc) appear
with the onset of symptoms, the protective antibody against HBsAg
(anti-HBs) appears very late, usually several weeks or months after
disappearance of HBsAg. Disappearance of HBsAg is considered to be a
sign of resolution but the virus often remains in occult form in the liver.

infection, whereby the word “occult” refers to the ap￾parent lack of HBsAg, which is present in an undetect￾able amount in such cases. In blood transfusion, up to
200 mL blood plasma is transferred, and the smallest
traces of HBV can lead to infection in the recipient.
Anti-HBc can be a marker for occult infection as was
recognized by Hoofnagle already in the 1970s [27]. For
a long time the small residual risk caused by occult
infected blood donors was tolerated. But with todays in￾creased safety demands, blood donors have to be tested
for both HBsAg and anti-HBc in many countries, e.g. in
Germany, since 2006. An anti-HBc determination is also
important before medically induced immunosuppression,
since an occult HBV infection can be reactivated under
these circumstances with severe or even fatal conse￾quences. This was already recognized in 1975 by Arie
Zuckerman and colleagues [28] but even today not all
hematologists are aware of this problem. Reactivation
can be suppressed with preemptive antiviral therapy if
the problem is recognized in advance.
Significance of IgM antibodies to HBcAg
Anti-HBc total antibody assays were useful to determine
whether a patient ever had contact to HBV but this
marker could not distinguish whether the infection was
acute or persistent or resolved. It had been long known
that the early immune response against an infectious
agent induced antibodies of the immunoglobulin class
M (IgM, M for macroglobulin), whereas weeks or months
later the antibodies belonged mainly to immunoglobulin
class G (IgG, G for Gamma). It was therefore only neces￾sary to determine the immunoglobulin class M of the
antibodies to distinguish between a fresh and an old infec￾tion. This used to be costly and laborious, as biophysical
methods (like ultracentrifugation, ion exchange or gel
chromatography) were needed to separate IgG and IgM. It
was a break-through for virus diagnostics when a very
simple test principle was developed for IgM Anti-HAV by
Bertram Flehmig (Tübingen, Germany) [29] and inde￾pendently by the author of the present paper for IgM
Anti-HBc [30]: covering the solid phase with an antibody
against IgM (anti-μ chain) and consequently using it to
capture the IgM from the sample. The HAV-Ag or HBcAg
is then added and, if bound by specific IgM, detected with
a labeled antibody. Today, this test principle is standard
for assay of most antiviral IgM antibodies.
Quantitation of IgM anti-HBc
Differentiating between an acute and chronic hepatitis B
infection was often difficult. Large clinical studies initiated
by Reiner Thomssen (Göttingen, Germany) in the 1970s
showed that the interpretation of the IgM anti-HBc results
obtained by the author was not as straightforward as most
clinical virologists had expected. Since the anti-μ capture
assay is very sensitive, some patients who resolved acute
HB remained positive for years and even patients who had
chronic HB without known acute phase were positive.
Only an accurate well standardized quantitation allowed
distinction of clinically apparent acute from chronic HB
[31]. Not all clinical virologists liked this differentiated
evaluation and made the test artificially insensitive leading
to the problem that mild acute infections were no longer
recognized.
One reason why IgM anti-HBc remains moderately
positive in chronic HBV infections was detected by David
Milich (La Jolla, California). HBcAg is an unusual T cell￾independent antigen which can activate B cells to produce
IgM anti-HBc [32]. The strong B cell immunogenicity of
HBcAg may be part of the immune evasion strategy of
HBV because it may interfere with the activation of HBcAg
specific cytotoxic T cell reactions. The IgG anti-HBc found
in resolved or inactive cases is induced by the normal
T cell-dependent class switch.
HBeAg and immune control of HBV infection
Discovery of HBeAg
Many researchers, including Blumberg, realized soon that
the mere presence of HBsAg does not allow an assessment
of the severity of the disease or the infectiousness of the pa￾tient, both of which may independently vary within a large
range. Some HBV carriers could be very infectious without
suffering from an obvious disease. In 1972, Swedish virolo￾gist Lars Magnius discovered, while looking for HBsAg sub￾types, an additional marker, HBeAg, in HBsAg positive sera
which helped to distinguish highly infectious from less in￾fectious HBV carriers [33]. The “e” is not an abbreviation
for “early” as some people believe; it stands on its own.
According to Magnius its meaning should not be disclosed
and considered an enigma. For several years, the biochem￾ical nature of HBeAg was also an enigma, but with the ad￾vent of artificial expression systems for HBV genes, William
Rutter’s team [34] and the author together with Volker
Bruss (at that time in Göttingen, Germany), [35] indepen￾dently showed that HBeAg is a non-particular secreted
form of HBcAg. The completely different processing and
function of HBeAg is caused by a preC signal sequence for
secretion preceding the HBc gene (see Figure 4).
HBeAg positive HBV carriers
HBeAg is not essential for virus replication. HBeAg nega￾tive variants of HBV with a mutated, non-functional preC
sequence were first described in 1989 by William Carman
[36] and can even cause fulminant hepatitis B. As shown
by David Milich, HBeAg acts as an immune modulator
and suppresses the recognition of HBcAg expressing cells
by T-lymphocytes [37] which is the main mechanism of
HBV immune control. The long term lack of effective im￾mune defenses allows production and secretion of the
Gerlich Virology Journal 2013, 10:239 Page 8 of 25
http://www.virologyj.com/content/10/1/239

virus with up to 1010 infectious particles per mL blood,
without the infected person showing clinical symptoms.
HBsAg is usually present at very high levels of between
30,000 and 200,000 ng/mL serum (Figure 6).
Waning HBeAg and chronic hepatitis B
In patients with chronic hepatitis B, the immune defense
is partially active, such that the viral loads and HBsAg
levels are lower (Figure 6). While the destruction of the
HBV-infected liver cells leads to chronic liver inflamma￾tion, it does not stop the infection, as new cells are con￾tinuously infected in the absence of neutralizing antibodies.
Only once the immune defenses become more efficient
can the patient reach a condition where HBsAg is still pro￾duced, but the production of virus particles is so slight
(viremia <104
/mL), that it can no longer cause any major
damage. These quasi-healthy HBsAg carriers have less
HBsAg in the blood (mostly <3,000 ng/mL) and no longer
have HBeAg, but rather the corresponding antibody, anti￾HBe. A seroconversion of HBeAg to anti-HBe and a sig￾nificant decrease of HBsAg are considered a good sign for
a spontaneous or therapy-induced improvement. But many
patients who have lost HBeAg may still suffer from pro￾gression of chronic hepatitis B because the virus has an
enormous capability to evade T and B cell immunity even
if HBeAg is no longer present.
Measurement of HBV infectivity
Obstacles
HBeAg gives a hint on the activity of HBV replication
and the almost absent host’s immune control. But a more
dependable marker for the activity of the infection (not in￾flammation and disease!) is the level of viremia. Normally,
the gold standard for measuring the number of infectious
viruses is replication in susceptible cells. Unfortunately,
HBV is highly species- and organ-specific. Permanent cell
lines of human hepatic origin have no or very low suscep￾tibility for HBV and even primary, differentiated hepato￾cyte cultures obtained from surgically excised human liver
pieces are suboptimal and require inoculation of one hun￾dred thousand or more virus particles for establishment of
a detectable transient infection. In contrast, HBV is ex￾tremely infectious for humans if it enters the blood stream
as has been observed in many outbreaks of the disease.
Lewellys Barker and Roderick Murray studied the infec￾tivity of plasma from an acute hepatitis B case systematic￾ally by injecting 1 ml dilutions of this plasma to so-called
“volunteers” (prison inmates) in 1951–54. They found that
dilutions of 1:104 still could cause clinical hepatitis. When
they re-analyzed their study samples in 1970 with the then
available AuAg test they found that dilutions up to 1:107
caused a clinically silent HBV infection [5].
Animal experiments
Similarly susceptible is the chimpanzee, which was intro￾duced as an experimental animal for HBV research by
James Maynard and Robert Purcell in the early 1970s [38]
when Krugman’s (in-)human experiments had already
raised vigorous public protest. As shown by several groups,
highly infectious sera could be diluted by factors of 1:108
and were still infectious in doses of 1 ml when given intra￾venously to chimpanzees.
Alternatives for highly sensitive in vivo detection of in￾fectious HBV are various immunodeficient mouse strains
which carry transplanted human hepatocytes, e.g. those
developed by Charles Rogler (New York), Jörg Petersen
and Maura Dandri (Hamburg) in 1998 [39]. These par￾tially humanized mice are at least as susceptible for HBV
infection as the chimpanzees. Since their generation also
depends on the very scarce pieces of healthy human or
chimpanzee liver, less limited resources are required.
Cell cultures
As Chinese researchers found in the 1990s, an unpro￾tected small animal species, the Tupaia (Tupaia belangeri)
living in South East Asia was susceptible for HBV. This
squirrel-like animal may be considered a predecessor of
primordial primates, the evolution of which branched off
as early as 80 million years ago from the line leading to
primates. The animal itself develops only a weak infection,
but Josef Köck and Michael Nassal (Freiburg) could show
that primary hepatocyte cultures from these animals are at
least as susceptible for HBV as primary human hepatocyte
cultures [40]. Primary Tupaia hepatocyte cultures have
been useful for many experimental studies including those
of Dieter Glebe (Giessen, Germany) studying the attach￾ment of HBV with the aid of these cell cultures [41].
Re-differentiation of hepatoma cell lines is another pos￾sibility to increase the susceptibility to HBV as was shown
by Philippe Gripon (Rennes, France) and Stephan Urban
(Heidelberg, Germany), and helped to characterize the at￾tachment site of HBV [42]. Since the HBV receptor has
been identified recently, hepatic cell lines can be made

susceptible by transfecting them with the receptor gene
(see below).
Quantitative measurement of HBV DNA
The assays for HBV infectivity described above were in￾dispensable for HBV research but are too expensive and
laborious for the laboratory diagnosis of HB viremia.
The best surrogate test is the sensitive and quantitative
determination of the number of HBV DNA molecules in
plasma or serum. In the early days, the endogenous DNA
polymerase reaction developed by Robinson was the first
feasible but relatively insensitive and laborious assay. Later
this was replaced by various techniques of nucleic acid
hybridization (e.g. dot blot) using cloned HBV DNA as la￾beled probes. These techniques were still of insufficient
sensitivity and accuracy and could not detect the low
viremia of healthy HBsAg carriers or occult HBV infec￾tions. They were, however, useful for distinction of high
and low infectivity and for HBV monitoring in early ther￾apy studies.
With the advent of PCR, a new era of medical microbiol￾ogy began and this has also shaped the hepatitis virology.
First approaches in the early 1990s with this method were
plagued by many technical problems: cross contamination,
inhibitors, false choice of primers and inappropriate ex￾traction of nucleic acids led to almost disastrous results
and much initial distrust in this revolutionary method. An
international quality control trial from 1995 revealed that
only 10 among 39 participating laboratories were able
to deliver faultless qualitative PCR results for a panel of
coded HBV DNA samples [43] and only the two reference
laboratories reached in addition the full test sensitivity.
One of the problems encountered by many participants
was incomplete DNA extraction. As was shown by the au￾thor in 1979 (when he was on visit in Robinson’s lab) the
virion-associated form of HBV DNA is covalently bound
to a protein [44]. This causes heavy losses of viral DNA
unless the protein is removed by protease digestion before
extraction. Nowadays, real time PCR for HBV DNA has
reached an excellent level of performance with a detection
limit close to the theoretical minimum of 1 DNA molecule
per reaction mix and a huge dynamic range up to 107 or
more. However, comparability of quantitative results ob￾tained with different commercially available test kits was
and is a problem. Thus, in 1991 the WHO introduced
International Standard preparations and an arbitrary Inter￾national Unit (IU) of HBV DNA [45]. The number of mol￾ecules per IU depends on the assay; but typically 5
molecules correspond to one IU HBV DNA.
HBV infectivity in real life
Intravenous inoculation
How does the number of HBV DNA molecules correlate
with the number of infectious and replication competent
viruses, and how does this translate to infectivity and
disease development in real life? Comparisons of the
chimpanzee infectious doses and the number of HBV
DNA molecules in HBeAg positive plasmas showed that
ten or less virus particles are sufficient to start a readily
detectable HBV infection if they are injected intravenously.
These findings are confirmed by observations on the very
rare inadvertent transmissions of HBV from blood donors
in the early phase of infection when HBsAg and even
HBV DNA are not yet detectable by the most sensitive
techniques.
Transmission by close contact
Intravenous injections occur only in medicine or illegal
drug use and here contaminations with miniscule traces
of infectious blood may transmit HBV, e.g. by re-use of
syringes. With the general introduction of single use de￾vices for most invasive procedures transmissions of HBV
have become rare. But incorrect procedures leading to
hepatitis B outbreaks still occur, in particular during blood
glucose testing and many other medical procedures. In nor￾mal life, small wounds and intimate mucocutaneous con￾tact may allow transmission from a highly viremic person
to others. Epidemiological experience shows that this dan￾ger is high when the values exceed 107 viruses/mL plasma,
but it is nearly non-existent when lower than 105
/ml.
Variable infectivity of HBV particles
The clear correlation between HBV DNA molecule num￾ber and infectious dose is lost if the sample comes from
the late or HBeAg negative phase of infection. Using mice
with implanted human liver cells as infection system, Junko
Tanaka (Hiroshima) and her team could show that in the
early phase of an experimental HBV infection in chimpan￾zees nearly all virus particles were infectious whereas in
the phase of decreasing viremia one 50% infectious dose
(ID50) contained 100 virus particles [46]. Very recent eval￾uations of inadvertent HBV transmissions from occult
infected blood donors showed that one ID 50 contained
as many as 1000 virus particles [47]. Thus, the HBV DNA
level is a direct marker for infectivity only if the sample
comes from the early phase of infection or from a quasi￾immunotolerant carrier with very high viremia. In the
other phases of infection protective antibodies may cover
up the essential attachment sites or unknown mechanisms
favor the generation of mutants with impaired infectivity.
The low infectivity of most inactive HBsAg carriers is not
only due to the fact that they have relatively low HBV
DNA levels (typically below 104 IU/mL) but their HBV
DNA is enclosed in virus particles the majority of which is
not infectious. Furthermore, low doses of infectious HBV
favor an inapparent course of the infection [5]. This is,
however, only true if the infected person is fully immuno￾competent. Otherwise, the infection may become chronic
Gerlich Virology Journal 2013, 10:239 Page 10 of 25
http://www.virologyj.com/content/10/1/239

in spite of a low ID50. If HBeAg negative variants are
transmitted to transiently immunocompromised patients
they may even develop fatal hepatitis [47].
HBV transmission to and from health care workers
In the past, the risk of acquiring an HBV infection by
performing exposure-prone procedures was so high that
after several decades of professional activity (even in low￾prevalence countries) the majority of health care workers
showed markers of previous or ongoing HBV infection.
Thus, many physicians became victims of their profes￾sional activities, were highly infectious HBV carriers and
thereafter a threat for the patients on whom they
performed exposure prone procedures. Since the 1970s,
there have been numerous reports on HBV transmissions
from health care workers with high viremia to patients,
usually during surgery. Most critical were thorax,
gynecological and oral surgery. The medical community
was sluggish to draw the necessary consequences. Initially,
the supervising authorities recommended only that HBV
carriers should wear double gloves while doing surgery
and be particularly cautious.
Restrictions for HBV positive health care workers
Only after numerous fatal transmissions and hundreds
of infections originating from HBV positive physicians
were identified and made public were more restrictive
measures taken as suggested in a consensus conference
[48]. One measure was to implement quasi-compulsory
vaccination for health care workers, another to wear pro￾tectice devices e.g. face masks or protective glasses during
activities generating sprays like in dentistry. As a conse￾quence, the situation has much improved; e.g. in Germany
where approximately 50% of all health care workers were
HBV marker positive in 1978, in the year 2000 only 5.5%
were positive, i.e. less than the 7.0% found in the average
population. The other essential change was obligatory con￾trol of HBsAg and anti-HBs in medical staff and the exclu￾sion of potentially infectious health care workers with
more than 20,000 IU/ml HBV DNA from exposure-prone
activities. In Germany and possibly in other countries,
however, after the year 2000 there was an over-reaction
whereby almost all HBsAg positive physicians irrespective
of viremia were excluded from any activities with patients
including injections or taking biopsies. Since the great ma￾jority of HBsAg positive health care workers has spontan￾eously low viremia or can be treated to achieve low
viremia, the restrictions which would have been necessary
in previous decades are no longer justified. However, after
the failures of the medical community in the past, the re￾sponsible authorities often decide on this sensitive matter
now in an overly formal manner.
Variability and pathogenicity of HBV
Human HBV genotypes
Besides the already mentioned HBs subtype determinants
d or y and w or r, Anne Marie Courouce (Paris) found sub￾determinants w1 to w4 with a typical geographic and eth￾nic distribution. HBsAg subtype adw2 was e.g. predomin￾antly found in the USA and northern Europe, ayw2 in the
Mediterranean, adw4 in indigenous Americans from Brazil
and adr in East Asia [49]. The immunological subtyping of
HBsAg was later extended by sequencing of the HBs gene
and eventually the entire HBV genome. Comparisons of
HBV DNA sequences from virus strains collected world￾wide, performed in 1988 by Hiroaki Okamoto and
colleagues suggested the existence of four genotypic groups
A - D (later called genotypes) that were divergent by more
than 8% in the DNA sequence [50]. This concept was
extended by Helene Norder and Lars Magnius (Stockholm)
in 2004 to genotypes A - F and the introduction of
subgenotypes being divergent by more than 4%. Some of the
genotypes such as D were found worldwide whereas others
were restricted to one continent like B and C in Asia, E in
Africa, and F and H in the Americas (Figure 7) [51]. Geno￾type E seems to have spread within the human population
quite recently because the descendants of those black
Americans who were imported 200–400 years ago to the
USA from Africa usually do not have this genotype but ra￾ther have subgenotype A2 like the descendants of Northern
European immigrants [52]. In contrast, subgenotype A1
which is prevalent in Brazil was obviously imported with the
slaves from East Africa and also spread via Somalia to the
Asian coast of the Indian Ocean [53]. In seeming agreement
with these observations, some estimates using bioinformatic
algorithms suggested that human HBV has a high mutation
rate and may not be older than a few hundred years. But hu￾man HBV is probably much older than indicated by these
estimates or historic migrations. The existence of a particu￾lar subgenotype C4 in Australian aborigines but nowhere
else in South East Asia or Oceania suggests that genotype C
existed before modern man reached Australia approximately
50,000 years ago and has there independently evolved from
the original genotype C ancestor [54]. The evolution of
HBV subgenotypes during prehistoric migrations within the
last 15,000 years has been recently confirmed by more
refined bioinformatic analyses [55]. In early 2013, genotypes
A - H (or putative I) and subgenotypes A1 - 7, B1- 9, C1 -
16, D1 - 9 and F1 - 4 have been identified. But the grouping,
e.g. of C subgenotypes [56] is under debate because some of
the (sub)genotypes, including I, may in fact be recombinants
of other (sub)genotypes. HBV genotypes are not only inter￾esting for anthropology and epidemiology but are also useful
for clinical reasons. Genotypes C, D and F are on the aver￾age more pathogenic than the other genotypes and geno￾types A and B respond better to an interferon therapy than
genotypes C and D.

Primate HBV. HBV as a virus species has a narrow host
range but is not restricted to humans. Own variants of
HBV have been detected in chimpanzees, gorillas, orangu￾tans and gibbons, and these variants are no more divergent
from the human genotypes A - H than the human geno￾types among themselves [57]. In contrast, the HBV-like
virus of the New World woolly monkey detected by Robert
Lanford is much more divergent, not as infectious for
chimpanzees as the human genotypes and, thus, considered
an individual virus species [58]. These phylogenetic rela￾tionships may suggest that HBV-like viruses have existed in
primates even before the branching-off of the New World
monkeys more than 26 million years ago. Today’s HBV
may have existed already when the hominini (ancestors of
modern homo sapiens) branched off 6 million years ago
from the chimpanzees. Observations in other animal spe￾cies (see below) suggest that HBV-like viruses have indeed
existed for at least 80 million years. Unlike HIV, there is no
evidence that human HBV strains originate from primates
or vice versa but it cannot be excluded that cross-species
from unknown sources have occurred (see below).
Low variability during the immunotolerant phase
Compared to HIV or hepatitis C virus, the HBV genome
sequence is very stable in most cases of acute or chronic
hepatitis B. Its sequence usually remains unchanged when
HBV is transmitted from an HBeAg positive source to a
non-immune person. According to the author’s experi￾ence, the subgenotype A2 strains from Central European
patients have virtually all the same sequence with only
very minor changes [59]. This high genetic stability of
HBV is partially the result of the extremely efficient usage
of the short HBV genome resulting in overlapping reading
frames and numerous regulatory, replicative or morpho￾genetic elements within the reading frames all of which
restrict formation of viable mutations. While the reverse
transcriptase of HBV is highly inaccurate, a kind of quality
control is achieved by the fact that only successfully tran￾scribed and processed genomes, i.e. partially double￾stranded DNA are enclosed in the secreted virus. Another,
possibly as important factor is its survival strategy which
largely depends on immune tolerance against the struc￾tural virus proteins. Immune tolerance is only maintained

most popular hepatitis B vaccines, is only prevalent in the low endemic regions of the Americas and Europe. This means that >99% of all HBV
carriers have other HBV subgenotypes.

when the antigen does not change and this is the case in
highly viremic long term HBV carriers. Tolerance against
HBcAg is induced and maintained by HBeAg, and pos￾sibly by the interfering non-protective B cell reaction to
HBcAg. High dose immune tolerance against the viral en￾velope HBsAg may be induced by the huge amounts of
subviral HBsAg particles. The expression in the liver (an
immunoprivileged organ) and the circulation in the blood
in the absence of danger signals also favor development of
immune tolerance.
Pathogenesis of acute hepatitis B
Highly replicative HBV infection is the normal course for
several weeks or months before immune recognition be￾gins, after considerable delay. A vigorous cellular immune
response suppresses viral replication and eliminates most
of the HBV expressing hepatocytes resulting in acute hepa￾titis. This model of immunopathogenesis has been well
supported by studies from Frank Chisari and others in
transgenic mice or chimpanzees and by careful analysis of
human T cell responses [60]. If the infectious dose is low
(typically less than 1000 ID50) the immune response may
start early enough before many hepatocytes are infected
and in this case the symptoms are so mild that they are
usually not noticed [5]. Appearance of neutralizing anti￾HBs antibodies in the late acute phase prevents the infec￾tion of new hepatocytes.
Occult HBV infection
Elimination of HBV genomes is usually not complete after
acute hepatitis B (even after mild infections) because some
HBV genomes remain as cccDNA in an occult form in the
liver; but their expression is largely controlled by the im￾mune system. The levels of HBV production are in most
cases so low that even with the most sensitive techniques
no HBV DNA is detectable in serum.
The term occult HBV infection is often used in a mis￾leading form, because according to the usual nomencla￾ture it is used if HBV DNA is positive but HBsAg negative.
In the author’s understanding of normal language, the
infection is no longer occult if a well-defined infection
marker like HBV DNA is detected in the serum. A truly
occult HBV infection has to be assumed if anti-HBc with
or without anti-HBs is specifically detected irrespective of
a negative result for HBV DNA in plasma. HBV DNA is
more often detectable if anti-HBs is missing. This is often
the case in HCV- or HIV-co-infected persons [61]. As long
as the infection remains truly occult, i.e. HBV DNA and
HBsAg are negative and HBV expression is low, no patho￾genicity is to be expected. The problem is the reactivation
under immunodeficiency particularly under medication
with B-lymphocyte destroying drugs (e.g. rituximab) which
may lead to fatal hepatitis after immune reconstitution
[62] or alternatively to highly viremic untreatable chronic
infection [63].
Pathogenesis of chronic hepatitis B
During acute hepatitis B, HBsAg disappears by definition
within six months. A longer persistence of HBsAg is
considered a marker for chronic HBV infection. Infec￾tion of newborns (from the HBV-infected mother) or in￾fants typically results in a persistent infection because
for unknown reasons an effective immune response does
not begin for years or decades. Infection of immuno￾compromised patients also leads to persistence even if
the immune impairment is mild as in hemodialysis pa￾tients. However, after a long anergic phase, immune
defense may emerge and lead to selection of escape mu￾tants. As soon as cellular immune responses against
HBcAg appear, HBeAg has lost its immunomodulatory
function and is a useless side product. HBeAg-negative
variants with enhanced HBcAg expression and viral rep￾lication usually take over and partially compensate for
the loss of destroyed HBV infected cells. Variants with
mutated T cell epitopes of HBcAg and HBsAg may be
selected, non-essential epitopes of the preS domain may
be deleted. The main point is now whether the immune
response is strong enough to keep HBV DNA replication
low. If so, the course may be benign although expression
of HBsAg may still occur (Figure 6). Finally, the immune
control will even suppress HBsAg to undetectable levels
in many chronic carriers. On the opposite, co-existence
of cytotoxic immune responses with ongoing strong HBV
DNA replication results in inflammatory disease, progres￾sive fibrosis of the liver and potentially in hepatocellular
carcinoma.
Late phase variability
In this phase of infection (independent of a prior acute,
occult or chronic course) the variability of the HBV gen￾ome is very high and leads to many defective forms which
by themselves may favor increased pathogenicity. Hot
spots of variability are the preC and core gene, the HBs
antigen loop, and parts of preS. There are several mecha￾nisms of how the preC sequence can be inactivated by a
single point mutation. Most common is the introduction
of a stop codon instead of a trp codon at the end of the
preC sequence, thus preventing translation of the HBeAg
precursor. This mutant is more stable in HBV genotype D
than in genotype A2. Consequently, HBeAg-negative vari￾ants are more prevalent in the Mediterranean than in
Central or Northern Europe.
The replication via reverse transcription (see below) and
the very large number of HBV genomes expressed (up to
1013 per patient day) facilitate mutations of every base at
least two times per day. In addition, the RNA editing cyti￾dine deaminase APOBEC3G (an interferon induced innate
Gerlich Virology Journal 2013, 10:239 Page 13 of 25
http://www.virologyj.com/content/10/1/239

defense factor against retroviruses) may hypermutate
the HBV pregenome [64]. Since the immune selection cri￾teria are the same in occult HBV infection, virus strains
reactivated under immunodeficiency are often highly mu￾tated, e.g. as described in ref. [62] and [63]. An unpub￾lished example from the author’s laboratory is shown in
Figure 8. These highly mutated variants are usually not
transmitted because viremia is in these cases much lower
than in early or immune tolerant phases. If these variants
are, however, transmitted they induce either inapparent
infection because of reduced fitness or very severe and
even fatal hepatitis B because these variants lack the im￾munomodulatory potential of wild type HBV [47].
Oncogenicity of HBV
Blumberg [1], page 147–158 and independently Wolf
Szmuness (New York Blood Center) [65] noted already
in the 1970s that chronic HBV infection was associated
with an increased incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma
(HCC). In areas with very high prevalence of chronic
hepatitis B, HCC was the most frequent form of cancer.
R. Palmer Beasley found in a large prospective study
with 22,707 middle-aged men in Taiwan an HCC inci￾dence of 1158 in 100,000 man-years among the HBsAg
carriers but only 5 in 100,000 for HBsAg negative per￾sons. In 54% of the HBsAg carriers HCC and liver cir￾rhosis were the cause of death [66]. Similar situations
are found in other regions highly endemic for HBV.
HCC enhancing cofactors are co-infection with hepatitis
C virus and exposure to aflatoxin.
HBV DNA in hepatoma cells
While the immunopathogenesis of HBV is relatively well
understood, the mechanisms of oncogenicity are not. Early
hopes that explantation and cultivation of hepatoma cells
from HBV carriers would lead to a culture system for HBV
were not fulfilled because the cells usually did not express
HBV antigens or HBV DNA. However, in 1976 South￾African researcher Jennifer Alexander was able to establish
the hepatoma cell line PLC PRF 5 (“The Alexander cell
line”) which secreted HBsAg [67]. Shortly thereafter the
team of William Rutter identified several fragments of HBV
DNA integrated at several chromosomal sites in that cell
line [68].
Oncogenic products of HBV
As was shown by several groups, in particular by Peter￾Hans Hofschneider (Munich, 1929–2004) and coworkers,
HBV-related HCC tissue is derived from clonal expansion of
single cells with one or more chromosomal insertions of
truncated or rearranged HBV DNA. Insertions of replication
competent HBV genomes were never observed. Some of the
integrated HBV DNA elements encoded truncated preS/S
proteins that had oncogenic potential in vitro or in immu￾nodeficient mice [69]. These proteins and the HBV X pro￾tein are transcriptional transactivators that may activate
deregulated cell proliferation and tumor formation [70]. The
role of the X protein was not understood for a long time,
because it was not essential for HBV replication
in permanent cell cultures. As shown by Ulrike Protzer
(Munich) and Massimo Levrero (Rome) and their co￾workers, it is however an essential transcription activator for
expression of the HBV proteins in differentiated hepatocytes
[71].
Insertional mutagenesis
Besides these directly oncogenic products, insertion of
HBV DNA promoters and enhancers may activate cellu￾lar oncogenes like myc (see below) or disrupt negative
regulators of proliferation. In some cases fusion proteins
of cellular growth factors and HBV proteins were even
observed [72]. However, there is no typical insertion site
or conserved altered cellular factor in human HCC. In fact,
integration seems to be a normal event during chronic
HBV-infection and leads to clonal growth of seemingly

the single letter code of the normal (wildtype) HBV, each square to a
mutation. The boxed-in part is named a-determinant and is believed
to be immunodominant, but immune escape induced mutations
occurred in the entire HBsAg loop. Yellow (shaded) squares cause
the loss of an immunodominant HBsAg subtype determinant. This
variant replicated in a patient receiving lymphoma therapy. The
patient was anti-HBc and anti-HBs positive before the
immunosuppressive lymphoma therapy and developed severe acute
hepatitis B after end of the therapy due to immunopathogenesis
against the variant which had become abundant under
immunosuppression. The serum from the acute reactivated hepatitis
B phase had a high virus load, but was HBsAg negative in all assays.

normal hepatocytes, a small proportion of which may fi￾nally turn to frank malignancy [73].
Persistent replication
According to clinico-epidemiological studies the main
driving force for development of HCC seems to be con￾tinuous HBV replication, particularly in HBeAg negative
patients. High HBV DNA levels >106 copies per ml serum
are 11 times more often associated with progression to
HCC than levels <300 copies/ml [74]. The role of HBV
DNA replication in this process is not clear. Possibly, the
peculiar structure of the HBV DNA (see below) may by it￾self have an enhancing effect on DNA repair in already
too heavily damaged cells. Successful antiviral therapy can
stop chronic hepatitis B and the progression of liver cir￾rhosis but a slightly elevated risk of HCC remains.
Non-primate animal models of hepatitis B
Orthohepadnaviruses
The frequent natural occurrence of HCC in woodchucks,
(a marmot-like animal living at the East coast of the USA)
prompted Robert Snyder and Jesse Summers (Philadelphia)
in 1978 to search for an HBV-like virus in these animals.
The woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV) discovered by them
showed virtually all properties of human HBV, about 60%
sequence homology, and even a serological cross reactivity
of the HBcAg with WHcAg but no cross reaction between
HBsAg and WHsAg [75]. Consequently, Jesse Summers
proposed the definition of a new virus species and a new
virus family named hepadnaviridae according to the organ
tropism (hepa for liver) and the nature of the nucleic acid.
Soon after, a closely related virus was found in ground
squirrels that are indigenous to the West coast of the USA,
by Patricia Marion in Robinson’s team, supporting this pro￾posal [76]. Both animals have proven very useful in the
study of hepadnaviruses. The very high oncogenicity of
WHV is caused by integration of WHV DNA and the in￾sertional activation of a woodchuck specific cellular onco￾gene N-myc [77].
Avihepadnaviruses
HCC was also known to occur in Peking ducks in China.
Chinese researchers found virus-like particles in duck sera
and sent serum samples to Blumberg (ref. 1 page 171). In a
follow-up of this discovery, William Mason (Philadelphia)
found the duck hepatitis B virus (DHBV) in Peking ducks
outside China as well and characterized it as HBV-like.
DHBV was also hepatotropic, caused very high viremia
without obvious disease, overproduced the viral surface
protein and had a similar morphology and genomic orga￾nization [78]. The advantage of the duck virus was that it
could be propagated in embryonated eggs and in readily
available primary duck hepatocyte cultures. There were,
however, also distinct differences to the mammalian
hepadnaviruses. The surface and core proteins had a differ￾ent structure, there was seemingly no HBx protein and the
overall sequence homology was low. The phylogenetic rela￾tionships suggested that the genera orthohepadnavirus of
mammalians and avihepadnavirus of birds could be distin￾guished. The group of Hans Will (Hamburg, Germany)
identified further avian hepadnaviruses in various species
of water fowl such as herons, cranes and storks. Studies
of these viruses confirmed the usually narrow host range
of hepadnaviruses and the conservation of the seemingly
non-essential HBV proteins HBx and HBeAg [79]. In con￾trast to orthohepadnaviruses, the avihepadnaviruses do not
cause HCC but they may cause hepatitis when infecting
adult birds. (The duck HCC in China is caused by chemical
carcinogens). Avihepadnaviruses apparently have existed
for >82 million years in birds, because various bird species
carry fragments of avihepadnaviral DNA as an endogenous
viral element integrated into their genome [80].
Neither ortho- nor avi-hepadnaviruses have economic
importance as animal pathogens. The animal viruses were,
however essential for the progress in our understanding of
HBV infection. DHBV was crucial for the elucidation of
the hepadnaviral replication cycle and the WHV-infected
woodchuck has become an important animal model for
pathogenicity and therapy of human HBV infections.
Hepadnaviral life cycle
Unusual structure of HBV DNA
Robinson had described the nucleic acid of HBV as a
small circular double-stranded DNA but he found that
the HBV DNA was profoundly different from that of
other DNA viruses. In contrast to polyoma- or papillo￾maviruses the circular DNA was not covalently closed
but had a nick in one strand and a variable gap in the
other [19]. As could be shown by the author in 1980, the
5’ends of the DNA strands were blocked, in case of the
longer minus strand by a at that time unidentified protein
[44]. All hepadnavirus species have this genome structure
(Figure 3). The mechanism by which these structures were
generated appeared enigmatic.
Reverse transcription of pregenomic RNA
The solution of the enigma came soon with the publica￾tion of Jesse Summers and William Mason on the replica￾tion of DHBV DNA in 1982 [81]. Surprisingly, the DNA
polymerase within the DHBV core particles, (isolated from
infected duck liver) transcribed in a first step an RNA
template and only in the second step the newly formed
DNA strand as reported by Robinson for serum-derived
HBV particles. With this discovery, it became evident that
the replication of the hepadnaviridae was in some steps
similar to that of the retroviridae. The similarity to retrovi￾ruses is mainly restricted to the ability of the viral DNA
polymerase to transcribe both RNA and DNA and to
Gerlich Virology Journal 2013, 10:239 Page 15 of 25
http://www.virologyj.com/content/10/1/239

remove by the coupled RNase H activity the transcribed
RNA template.
HBV DNA replication
Due to the efforts of many eminent virologists, among
them Jesse Summers, Pierre Tiollais, Harold Varmus, Heinz
Schaller, Don Ganem, Michael Kann, Dan Loeb, Michael
Nassal, Christoph Seeger, John Tavis and their coworkers,
the following picture (Figure 9) of the HBV life cycle has
taken shape within the last 30 years as described in a review
from Michael Nassal (Freiburg, Germany) [82]. After spe￾cific attachment to differentiated hepatocytes and endo￾cytosis (see below), the viral envelope is removed, the core
particle is actively transported to the nuclear pore and
within the nuclear pore the viral DNA is released to the nu￾cleoplasm [83]. There it is converted to covalently closed
circular (ccc) DNA by cellular repair factors and remains
an episomal minichromosome. The cccDNA binds liver￾specific and ubiquitous transcription factors and is the tem￾plate for the cellular RNA polymerase II which generates
the pregenomic and subgenomic mRNAs. The pregenomic
RNA is translated to core protein and by internal transla￾tion initiation to DNA polymerase. The core protein sub￾units assemble spontaneously to immature core particles
which with the help of cellular chaperones encapsidate
their own mRNA and the viral DNA polymerase. Reverse
transcription starts only within the core particle at a speci￾fic secondary structure of the pregenomic RNA called ɛ
for “encapsidation” because this site, together with the poly￾merase, also mediates the selective encapsidation of the
pregenomic RNA. Hepadnaviruses use a hydroxyl group
of a tyrosine residue in their DNA polymerase for priming
of their first (minus) DNA strand. This creates the strange
covalent linkage between HBV DNA and protein. After
Figure 9 Life cycle of HBV. Attachment to liver-specific receptors (heparansulfate proteoglycan and NTCP, see text) leads to endocytosis of HBV
and release of HBV core particles. These are transported to the nucleus and arrested at the nuclear pore complex where the HBV genome is
released to the nucleus. In the nucleus, the viral DNA is “repaired” to the covalently closed circular (ccc) DNA and complexed with nucleosomes
(not shown). In interaction with transcription factors (not shown), the ccc DNA is transcribed to the pregenomic and subgenomic mRNAs. The
mRNAs are transported, mainly without splicing, to the cytoplasm. The two subgenomic mRNAs for the three HBs proteins are translated at the
endoplasmic reticulum, assemble to subviral HBsAg particles and are secreted via the Golgi apparatus. In parallel, the pregenomic mRNA is
translated in the cytosol to the HBV core protein and the viral polymerase, whereby the three components assemble to the immature core
particle. The HBV genomes mature within the core particles via reverse transcription of the pregenomic mRNA to DNA. The mature core particles
can migrate again to the nuclear pore complex or are enveloped by the surface proteins and secreted via the multivesicular bodies (MVB).
Gerlich Virology Journal 2013, 10:239 Page 16 of 25
http://www.virologyj.com/content/10/1/239

completion of the first strand and degradation of the
pregenomic RNA by the viral RNase H, the capped 5’ter￾minal remnants of the RNA are used as primer for the plus
strand synthesis. As shown by Volker Bruss, only mature
core particles which contain a complete DNA minus strand
and a partial plus strand interact with the preS domain of
the membrane associated viral surface proteins and acquire
the viral envelope [84]. Interestingly, the preS domain is ini￾tially in the cytosol, but later about half of these preS do￾mains are translocated to the virus surface where they can
function as attachment site [85]. For a long time it was be￾lieved that HBV is secreted via the Golgi apparatus but this
is only true for the small HBsAg particles. Complete HBV
was recently shown by Reinhild Prange to be exported via
multivesicular bodies like many other enveloped viruses
[86]. The very interesting details of this entire process shall
not be presented here and are still under investigation in
many laboratories.
This replication cycle is very different from that of the
retroviridae. Retrovirus particles contain their genome as
two copies of RNA and start reverse transcription only after
entry into the target cell. They use tRNA as primer for their
minus strand DNA. The completed double stranded DNA
is linear and needs to be integrated into the host genome
before synthesis of the pregenomic RNA. The progeny virus
is assembled and released at the plasma membrane as im￾mature particles which require cleavage of the viral gag pro￾teins by the viral protease to become infectious.
Identification of the HBV receptors
In 1987, Mary Ann Sells and George Acs succeeded in
generating the stably HBV-transfected hepatoma cell line
HepG2.2.15 which was permissive for replication of in￾fectious HBV and has been crucial for many studies on
HBV, in particular for development of antiviral drugs
[87]. But this and similar cell lines did not facilitate the
search for the factors mediating efficient attachment
and entry of HBV. Many publications claimed to have
detected functional receptors for HBV, but the search
for them remained unsuccessful for decades. Only re￾cently, Camille Sureau (Tours, France) could prove by
a meticulous mutational analysis that the previously by
J. P. Allain identified heparansulfate proteoglycan bind￾ing capacity of the small HBsAg protein [88] is essential
(but not sufficient) for infectivity and that the binding
sites coincide with neutralizing epitopes of HBsAg [89].
However, this receptor cannot explain the peculiar spe￾cies specificity of HBV because it is present in livers of
all mammalians.
The species-specificity of attachment to an uptake medi￾ating receptor rests in the amino terminal preS1 domain of
the large viral surface protein. The large HBsAg protein is a
minor component in the 20 nm HBsAg particles but
a main component of the virus particles. It remained
unrecognized for many years but was finally identified by
the author together with Klaus Heermann in 1984 [90].
Soon after in 1986, Alfred Neurath (New York) character￾ized the preS1 domain as potential attachment site of HBV
to hepatic cells [91] but it took another 26 years to identify
a functional cellular receptor for this attachment site. Don
Ganem (San Francisco) showed in 1995 that the species￾specificity of HBV-like viruses in birds was mediated by the
preS domains of their large surface proteins [92] and identi￾fied later an avian receptor for this attachment protein [93].
The studies from Dieter Glebe on the preS1-dependent in￾fection of Tupaia hepatocytes [94] inspired Li Wenhui and
colleagues (Beijing, China) to start a genome-wide search
for liver-specific surface molecules common to humans
and Tupaias. Very recently, they identified the liver-specific
sodium-dependent taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide
(NTCP) as an essential receptor for the preS1 attachment
site of HBV and could prove its specificity by the fact that
this receptor from Tupaias and man (a susceptible primate
species) but not from non-susceptible primates mediates
HBV infectivity [95]. The receptor is only expressed in the
intact liver, disappears within a few days in primary hepato￾cyte cultures and is absent in undifferentiated hepatoma
cell cultures.
Therapy of hepatitis B
In the 20th century, therapy of viral infections lagged far
behind the impressive antibiotic therapies against patho￾genic bacteria. The in vitro cultivation of viruses was and is
much more difficult than cultivation of most bacteria. Fur￾thermore, viruses are so closely embedded in the biochem￾ical host cell machinery that it appeared for long almost
hopeless to find Paul Ehrlich’s magic bullet (a substance
that selectively targets a pathogenic organism, but not the
host) against them. An alternative approach was the adop￾tion of natural antiviral defense factors for therapy.
Interferon
In 1957 Isaacs and Lindenmann reported that the presence
of inactivated influenza virus in an infected cell induced
production of a secreted cellular factor, called interferon,
which protected neighboring cells against infection not
only by influenza virus but many other viruses as well. The
early hopes to use interferon as a universal drug against all
or at least many viruses did not materialize in clinical prac￾tice. But in 1976, William Robinson and Thomas Merigan
(Stanford, California) reported that interferon alpha (at that
time produced in human leukocyte cultures and very ex￾pensive) suppressed HBV replication and cured some pa￾tients suffering from chronic hepatitis B [96]. Further
clinical studies showed that only a minority of the patients
could be cured by this therapy while the majority showed a
relapse after the end of therapy or even viral breakthrough
under therapy.
Gerlich Virology Journal 2013, 10:239 Page 17 of 25
http://www.virologyj.com/content/10/1/239

Indication for interferon therapy
After 36 years of experience, interferon alpha (meanwhile
recombinant and in polyethylene glycol-conjugated form)
still has its place in HBV therapy, but the patients need to
be carefully selected, because interferon has many severe
side effects and contra-indications, and only a minority will
show a sustained response. Interferon suppresses HBV rep￾lication but the exact mechanism is not known and today
more dependable chemical antivirals with less side effects
are available. The main advantage of interferon is that it
can enhance the body’s own immune defense, and acceler￾ate the sustained resolution of the infection. Thus, patients
with active inflammation, i.e. elevated transaminsases,
and partially successful immune control (i.e. moderate
viremia < 108 IU/ml) are the best candidates for this stren￾uous therapy. The cccDNA form of the HBV genome is
probably as stable as the host chromosome and can cur￾rently not be attacked by any available drug. However,
interferon may induce innate defense mechanisms e.g. the
RNA editing cytidine deaminase APOBEC3G, which may
damage the HBV pregenome, or it may enhance apoptosis
of infected cells. Accelerated hepatic cell turnover in ab￾sence of HBV replication will decrease HBV cccDNA to
innocuous levels. Long-term follow-up has confirmed that
patients with a sustained viral response regain a normal
life expectancy [97].
Monitoring of therapy
Since best results are obtained with 48 weeks of interferon
therapy, it is necessary to recognize as early as possible
those patients who will not develop a sustained response.
The decrease of the HBV DNA level in plasma is a neces￾sary condition but not suitable as predictor for long-term
success. The usefulness of monitoring the HBsAg concen￾tration for the early prognosis of acute hepatitis B was
reported by the author already in the 1970s [98], but these
findings were ignored until recently. In the last years many
clinical studies showed that the decrease of the HBsAg
level indicates in most cases indirectly the decreasing
amount of intrahepatic cccDNA due to immune elimin￾ation of infected cells. If the interferon therapy leads to
sustained response, a significant decrease of HBsAg is de￾tectable within 12 weeks. An important point to consider
is that not all HBV genotypes are equally susceptible to
this therapy: genotype A and B are more responsive than
C or D [97].
Inhibitors of reverse transcriptase
Although viruses become parts of their host cell during
their life cycle, basic research on their replication mecha￾nisms identified various virus-specific biochemical path￾ways that could be targets of pharmaceutical intervention.
The nucleoside analogue acyclovir against herpes simplex
and varicella zoster virus was the first example of a
successful nontoxic antiviral drug taylored to the bio￾chemistry of its viral target. Merigan and Robinson turned
in the late 1970s to then available inhibitors of DNA poly￾merases when they realised that interferon alone would
not help the majority of patients. However, these early
drugs, though effective, were highly toxic, in particular to
the mitochondrial DNA polymerase γ. With the advent of
HIV in the developed countries, research on antiviral ther￾apy got a strong boost leading to the first drug azido￾thymidine in 1987 which inhibited more specifically the
reverse transcriptase of HIV, but it was unfortunately in￾active against HBV.
Lamivudine
In 1991 Raimond Schinazi’s team reported inhibition of
HBV DNA synthesis in HepG2.2.15 cells by the HIV drug
lamivudine, a thio-derivative of deoxycytosine [99]. After
licensing lamivudine for therapy of HIV it was noted by
Yves Benhamou and colleagues that patients who were
co-infected with HBV lost (transiently) their HB viremia
and showed clinical improvement of hepatitis [100]. The
first successful short term clinical trial with lamivudine
in HBV monoinfected patients was published in 1995 by
Jules Dienstag [101].
Although it appears logical, it is not self-evident that
RT inhibitors lead to rapid improvement of HBV associ￾ated inflammatory liver disease because they do not in￾hibit HBV antigen expression. As pointed out above, the
current view of HBV induced immune pathogenesis would
suggest that the RT inhibitors act slowly by preventing in￾fection of new cells while the still ongoing antigen expres￾sion of viral antigen in the infected cells would lead to their
immune recognition and elimination. For unknown rea￾sons, the suppressed DNA replication leads directly to a de￾crease of cell damage with enhanced survival of the already
infected cells. Thus, the RT inhibitors cannot eradicate the
pre-existing cccDNA and must be given continuously.
Lamivudine was quite effective and well tolerated, but did
not turn out to be the solution to the problem. Unfortu￾nately, resistance soon developed in cases with high replica￾tion. After 5 years of therapy 75% of the treated patients
had resistent HBV strains [97]. Due to the overlapping poly￾merase and HBsAg reading frame some of the resistance
mutations also led to a mutated HBsAg sequence with re￾duced binding to diagnostic or protective anti-HBs anti￾bodies [102]. With HIV, the resistance problem was rapidly
countered by introduction of a triple combination therapy,
but for HBV this concept was not immediately feasible.
Newer drugs had to be developed. Today, lamivudine is no
longer justified as a first line drug against HBV due to the
resistance problem and this has to be considered when
planning HIV therapy in HBV-coinfected patients. An add￾itional problem is that lamivudine resistant strains are able
to acquire resistance to the very efficient drug entecavir
Gerlich Virology Journal 2013, 10:239 Page 18 of 25
http://www.virologyj.com/content/10/1/239

which is not prone to resistance if used as first drug. For
short term treatment, e.g. of very severe acute hepatitis or
for prophylaxis of HBV reactivation Lamivudine may still
be an option.
Adefovir and Tenofovir
The acyclic nucleotide analog adefovir was described as
early as 1989 by DeClercq as an inhibitor of various retro￾viruses in vitro, but it took until 2002 to receive approval
for the therapy of lamivudine resistant HBV infections.
Unfortunately, its activity on HBV was relatively low and
completely absent in about one quarter of the patients. Fur￾thermore, it induced in many cases selection of resistant
HBV mutants with a stop codon in HBsAg, reminiscent of
the HCC-associated truncated preS/S proteins [103]. In the
meantime Adefovir should be completely replaced by newer
drugs such as tenofovir. This structurally very similar drug
was approved in 2001 as HIV drug and was soon shown to
be superior to adefovir for HBV as well [104], but it was
only approved for HBV in 2008. Today it is the drug of
choice for chronic hepatitis B, because it is well tolerated
and resistance has never been observed [97]. However, both
adefovir and tenofovir have nephrotoxicity as side effect.
Entecavir
The guanosine analog entecavir was originally developed
against herpes simplex virus but was not adequately ef￾fective. In 1997 its very strong activity against HBV was
shown in the HepG2.2.15 cell line. In 2001, a first proof
of principle short term study showed its efficacy in pa￾tients with lamivudine resistant chronic hepatitis B. Offi￾cial approval followed in 2006 after large clinical studies
proved the superiority of entecavir over lamivudine. Re￾sistance development is low in treatment-naïve patients
but with pre-existing lamuvidine resistance more than
half of the patients develop resistance against entecavir
as well. In rare cases of suboptimal tenofovir efficacy a
combination with entecavir may be useful [97].
Other approaches
Several other RT inhibitors have been licensed but they
have not reached widespread application. Telbivudin has a
significant resistance problem, but it has been successfully
used to suppress high viremia in HBV infected pregnant
women before delivery, thus protecting the newborn from
an excessive viral load [105]. Together with tenofovir it is
the only NIH class B drug for treatment during pregnancy.
In contrast to HIV, combination therapies, e.g. inter￾feron with RT inhibitors have not demonstrated superior
results. For prevention of re-infection after liver trans￾plantation in a previous HBV carrier a combination of
RT inhibitors with hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG)
may be useful. The competitive attachment inhibitor
myrcludex [106], a preS1-lipopeptide developed by Stephan
Urban (Heidelberg) is undergoing clinical trials and may be
particularly useful against hepatitis delta virus which has
adopted the HBV envelope. Therapeutic vaccination with
HBsAg in combination with RT inhibitors or immuno￾stimulatory substances has not been successful in clinical
studies. Immunotherapy with various HBV-derived antigens
or HBV antigen-expressing DNA in combination with anti￾viral therapy has been undertaken in various experimental
systems, e.g. by Michael Roggendorf in infected woodchuck
with partial success [107]. Targeted destruction or silencing
of the hepadnaviral cccDNA would be the ultimate therapy,
but is still science fiction.
Vaccination
In view of the still unsatisfactory therapy of HBV infec￾tions prevention has highest priority. Besides obeying
strict hygiene with all invasive procedures and a consid￾erate life style, vaccination is the most important way to
prevent hepatitis B diseases.
Passive immunization
Development of the active vaccination took from
Blumberg’s first idea in 1968 to introduction to the market
15 years, but passive immunization was more rapidly
available. Human immunoglobulin preparations contain￾ing very high levels of anti-HBs (HBIG) have been proven
useful in protecting persons even shortly after exposure to
HBV, e.g. after a prick with a blood contaminated injection
needle. Most urgent was the protection of newborns from
HBV infected HBeAg positive mothers because they be￾come in 70 - 90% of the cases chronic HBV carriers. In
the early 1980s, R. Palmer Beasley conducted a controlled
study in Taiwan showing that intravenous HBIG given im￾mediately after birth could prevent HBV infection in 71%
of newborns from HBsAg and HBeAg positive mothers
[108]. However, the passively administered anti-HBs fades
with a half-life of 22 days and is, if given alone, only an in￾terim solution.
First generation vaccines
Saul Krugman was the first to report on a so-called vac￾cination against hepatitis B in 1971. He diluted Australia
antigen positive serum from his previous human experi￾ments 1:10, boiled it briefly to kill the virus and injected
this material to mentally handicapped children as a kind
of vaccine. After two injections, he injected infectious
HBV containing serum as challenge to the children and
found incomplete, but statistically significant protection
[109]. The study suggested that Australia antigen positive
serum would contain a protection inducing antigen, but
due to the crude nature of the “vaccine” it was not conclu￾sive. Using chimpanzees as experimental animals, Robert
Purcell and John Gerin from the NIH, and in parallel
Maurice Hilleman from MSD, could prove in 1975 that
Gerlich Virology Journal 2013, 10:239 Page 19 of 25
http://www.virologyj.com/content/10/1/239

Blumberg’s concept of using purified 20 nm HBsAg par￾ticles from carrier plasma as HB vaccine was valid and
could protect against an intravenous challenge with 3000
chimpanzee-infectious doses [110]. Residual HBV infectiv￾ity of the HBsAg preparation was removed by treatment
with formalin. Philippe Maupas and Alain Goudeau went
one step further and used purified formalin-treated purified
HBsAg as vaccine (later produced by Institute Pasteur,
Paris) for staff and patients of hemodialysis wards who at
that time had a very high risk of HBV infection. In 1976
they reported good protection rates particularly in the staff
[111] but they had only a historical control group and, thus,
not all observers acknowledged these findings as convin￾cing. A state of the art field study was published by Wolf
Szmuness in 1980 using the plasma-derived vaccine pro￾duced at MSD. Szmuness had recognized that male homo￾sexuals in New York had an extremely high incidence of
HBV infections and performed a large placebo-controlled
study with 1083 (truly voluntary) participants [112]. The
protection rate of the vaccine was 92%. After this study, the
recommendation to vaccinate all kinds of high risk groups,
including medical staff, was adopted in many countries.
However, the newly developed vaccine was not well ac￾cepted. Soon after the landmark study of Szmuness it be￾came apparent that a part of the HBsAg carrier plasma
used for production of the MSD vaccine came from do￾nors who later developed AIDS. At that time the agent of
AIDS was not yet identified and it could not be guaran￾teed that this unknown agent would be inactivated by the
treatments sufficient for HBV infectivity. Furthermore
many unspecific fears existed about oncogenicity or auto￾immunity caused by the vaccine. The main disadvantage
was, however, that with increasing acceptance and success,
this type of vaccine would have dried out its own resource,
i.e. the chronic HBV carrier.
Second generation vaccines
With the cloning of the HBV genome and the identifi￾cation of the HBs gene in 1979 a new era of vaccine pro￾duction was opened, although the beginning was not
straightforward. HBsAg could not be expressed in E. coli
in spite of initial claims. The open reading frame for
HBsAg was identified with the aid of the partial amino
acid sequence of the major protein of the plasma-derived
HBsAg which had been determined in 1977 by Darrell
Petersen and Girish Vyas (San Francisco). They found that
the major HBsAg protein existed in an unglycosylated and
a single N-glycosylated form with ca. 220 amino acids
[113]. The larger proteins found in purified HBsAg (see
Figure 2) could be removed by treatment with proteases
seemingly without loss of HBs antigenicity. The vaccine
from MSD was in fact treated with pepsin and did not
contain these larger proteins. Thus, it appeared logical to
use the gene encoding the major HBs protein for
production of the “recombinant” vaccine, i.e. using
recombination of the gene with the DNA of expression
vectors. Expression of glycosylated and secreted HBsAg
particles in mammalian host cells was possible but the
yield was relatively low and mammalian cell culture is rela￾tively expensive. Thus, in the early 1980s Pablo Valenzuela
for MSD [114] and Michel de Wilde for Smith Kline RIT
(today GSK) [115] generated yeast cell strains which
expressed the major HBs protein in very large amounts
(800 mg/liter yeast culture) at low cost. The product was
not completely identical to the natural HBsAg, because
it did not assemble spontaneously to the 20 nm particles,
was not secreted and not glycosylated. But protection
experiments in chimpanzees published in 1984 by MSD
were very encouraging [116] and field studies in newborns
from HBsAg and HBeAg positive mothers performed in
Thailand by Yong Poovorawan and GSK were also very
convincing [117]. Thus, in 1986 yeast-derived HBsAg be￾came the standard vaccine against HBV. Rapid immu￾nization schemes for urgent cases (e.g. 3 injections within
3 weeks) are possible but three or four injections within
6 or 12 months are optimal for induction of dependable
long lasting immunity. With the advent of an inexpensive,
but highly protective and well tolerated hepatitis B vaccine,
WHO recommended in 1992 to implement universal child￾hood vaccination worldwide and meanwhile ca. 180 coun￾tries have adopted this measure [118].
Medical impact of the vaccine
Taiwan was the first country to begin with universal child￾hood vaccination in 1984. At that time, the rate of perinatal
transmission was extremely high leading to a nation-wide
HBsAg carrier rate of ca. 10%. Twenty years later only 1.2%
of those borne after beginning of the vaccination campaign
were HBsAg carriers. Although HCC is mainly a disease of
advancing years, the impact of the vaccination quickly be￾came apparent in children and adolescents because its inci￾dence dropped significantly from 0.57 to 0.17 in 100,000
person years in that age group after the beginning of mass
vaccination. Thus, the hepatitis B vaccine was the first suc￾cessful vaccine against a specific form of cancer [119]. Simi￾lar observations were reported from other parts in the
world. In low prevalence countries like Italy the vaccination
has probably contributed (among other factors) to a very
strong decrease of hepatitis B incidence.
Observations in Taiwan [120] and Thailand [121] or in
high risk groups of other countries suggest that the pro￾tection becomes weaker within 20 years but the immune
memory is good enough to mitigate the infection in the
ca. 23% of those infected. Those with no or with low anti￾HBs are still protected against HBV disease but they get a
clinically silent infection with transient HBs antigenemia,
or anti-HBc seroconversion or increase of the anti-HBs

titer. The necessity or timing of later booster injections is
a matter of debate.
Shortcomings of the vaccine
The early studies with the plasma- or yeast-derived
vaccines suggested excellent immunogenicity with 99%
seroprotection rates in healthy children or adolescents.
However, in adults the rate of unprotected non-responders
(with <10 IU/ml anti-HBs 4 weeks after the last dose) is
ca. 5 - 7% [122] and increases to 70% under unfavorable
circumstances [123]. Risk factors for non-response are
numerous: male gender, old age, obesity, smoking and
various situations in which the immune system is im￾paired, e.g. diabetes or hemodialysis. Most important is
the failure of protection against perinatal transmission in
ca. 10 - 20% of newborns from HBsAg and HBeAg posi￾tive mothers because they become chronic carriers with
the most negative prognosis. These failures are the reason
for a 30% residual incidence of HCC in Taiwan [119]. In ca.
23 - 28% of the perinatal vaccine failures HBsAg escape mu￾tations have been observed whereas in the pre-vaccination
era the proportion of these mutants was only 8%. Fortu￾nately, they no longer appear to be on the increase and have
not (yet?) gained epidemiological significance [124].
The clinically silent virus breakthroughs in vaccinated
persons may be considered insignificant but these infec￾tions may create a problem for the HBV safety of blood
[125] or organ donations. Furthermore, it appears that
these silent infections may persist in occult form in the
liver and may reactivate with serious consequences if
the person becomes immunodeficient [126]. The occult
or reactivated HBV strains in most cases contain several
HBsAg escape mutants against which the vaccine-induced
immune response may not protect as shown in Figure 8.
A possibly relevant weakness of the most widespread vac￾cines is that they represent only the HBV subgenotype
A2 while >99% of the HBV carriers worldwide have other
genotypes (Figure 7). Observations in American blood
donors suggest that protection against the homologous
HBV genotype is complete even if the anti-HBs level is
low (<100 IU/L), whereas such low levels allow transmis￾sion of other HBV genotypes as frequently as in unvaccin￾ated persons. The important benefit of the vaccination is
that these heterologous infections remain clinically silent
and do not result in frank chronicity [125].
Other vaccine concepts
Overall the current vaccine is an enormous success, how￾ever, with a few obvious improvements nonresponse, viral
breakthroughs and occult infections could be minimized.
Furthermore, a highly potent vaccine could possibly be the
basis for an immune therapy of chronic hepatitis B and
high chronic viremia. While a complete elimination of the
virus from the organism is probably impossible, a
successful therapy would lead to a significant decrease of
infectivity in the HBV carriers. Together with a high rate of
immune persons, this will finally allow for eradication of
HBV from the population as suggested e.g. by Ding Shinn
Chen [127]. Decades of experience suggest that the protec￾tion induced by the vaccine depends mainly on a sufficient
level of neutralizing antibodies and a long-lasting B cell
memory. With today’s knowledge of HBV biology, the de￾sign of a hepatitis B vaccine would probably be different.
The preS1 domain of the large HBs protein is the most
important attachment factor and the most effective target
of neutralizing antibodies [128]. In contrast to the HBs
antigen loop, it is highly conserved in the various HBV ge￾notypes and escape mutants are virtually unknown. The
designers of the recombinant vaccines [116,117] knew in
1980 that there was a preS sequence upstream of the HBs
gene but since the protease treated HBsAg seemed to have
full antigenicity and immunogenicity, they neglected it.
Once the preS domain was discovered to be a real viral
component and its functions for HBV were understood,
several entrepreneurs have developed and tried to intro￾duce preS-containing vaccines [129,130], but they are rarely
used in spite of superior results in field trials particularly in
non-responders to the yeast-derived vaccine [131]. HBsAg
with or without preS1 expressed in mammalian cell cul￾ture would be an additional improvement because it con￾tains only the relevant conformational HBs epitopes and
no misfolded antigen [128]. The approach of DNA vaccin￾ation was in fashion for a while but it turned out to be
more suitable for mice than for men. All kinds of viral
vectors were considered as potential carriers for the HBs
and preS gene, e.g. Semliki forest virus with promising
preliminary results [132], but none of these have ever en￾tered human trials. After almost 30 years of recombinant
hepatitis B vaccines some of their deficits are now quite
apparent, but the only recognizable progress in practice
is the introduction of stronger adjuvants for certain groups
of weak responders. This course is a double edged sword
because improved immunogenicity may be paid for with
more side effects.
Perspectives
Looking back on the 50 years since the discovery of
Australia antigen the development in viral hepatitis is an ex￾emplary reflection of the progress in medicine as a whole
through biomedical science. The level that has been reached
is formidable, and the scientific possibilities are almost too
great to imagine. There is still much to do, especially in
medical practice. Quantitative assays for HBV DNA, HBsAg
and anti-HBs should be performed more often and their
standardization should be improved. Specificity and sensitiv￾ity of anti-HBc assays is still unsatisfactory. The significance
of occult HBV infections and the danger of reactivation are
too often unknown or neglected. The dimensions of HBV
Gerlich Virology Journal 2013, 10:239 Page 21 of 25

variability and pathogenicity have still to be explored. Indica￾tion and monitoring of therapy including well-founded stop￾ping rules should be further optimized. Medications leading
to sustained cure should be sought for. Vaccination coverage
should be constantly increased, particularly in those popula￾tions in which it is most necessary. Current hepatitis B vac￾cines are quite good compared to other anti-viral vaccines
but this does not mean that improvement is unnecessary.
An effective immune therapy for HBV would be highly de￾sirable and a great stimulus for research on infections
against which not even preventive vaccines are available, e.g.
HIV or HCV. With sufficient efforts in diagnosis, prevention
and therapy, HBV could be eradicated.
