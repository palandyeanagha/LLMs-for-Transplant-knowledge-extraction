Objectives: Upon completion of this article, the reader should
be able to identify factors that may contribute to improved
surgical outcomes in Crohn disease.
Crohn disease (CD) continues to present both medical and
surgical challenges. Throughout North America, the prevalence
of CD varies regionally from 26.0 to 198.5 cases per 100,000
persons.1 The five classes of drugs used to treat CD are amino￾salicylates (5-ASA), antibiotics, steroids, immune modulators,
and biologic therapy. Despite advances in medical manage￾ment, 75 to 80% of patients require surgery for CD with up to
50% of these within the first 10 years after diagnosis.2 The
potential for multiple surgeries and short bowel syndrome
exists with CD as more than 30% will require further surgery
after their initial resection.3 As a result, patients are generally
maximized on nonoperative therapy and surgery is not rec￾ommended unless absolutely necessary. Consequently, at the
time of surgical presentation, patients frequently are malnour￾ished and immunosuppressed with some demonstrating in￾tra-abdominal sepsis. These complicating factors of CD pose
significant challenges for the surgeon. Preoperative optimiza￾tion is critical to ensure the best possible surgical outcome and
this review addresses some key issues.
Nutrition
Poor preoperative nutrition increases postoperative morbid￾ity rates and intra-abdominal septic complications.4–6 As
most patients undergo surgery as a last option, many are
malnourished due to chronic debilitation. However, there is
no gold standard test to diagnose malnutrition as it involves a
complex evaluation of multiple factors; it may be most simply
defined as any nutritional imbalance.7,8 The nutritional defi￾ciencies encountered are a result of insufficient dietary intake
(due to postprandial pain and diarrhea), malabsorption (from
mucosal inflammation and diarrhea), systemic inflammation
(that alters protein synthesis and increases protein catabo￾lism), and the side effects of medications used to treat the
CD.9,10 Nutritional optimization should be performed to
enhance the nonoperative management of CD and decrease
postoperative morbidity.
Postoperative complications following anastomotic leaks
may be devastating. There are numerous studies evaluating
anastomotic leaks and hypo-albuminemia, with anastomotic
dehiscence consistently associated with a serum albumin
levels below 3.5 g/dL in elective colorectal resections.11–15
Makela et al identified 44 anastomotic leaks and when
compared with 44 controls matched for age, gender, and
indication for surgery, hypoalbuminemia, and weight loss
greater than 5 kg were significantly associated with leaks.13
Suding et al demonstrated that a baseline albumin level of less
than 3.5 g/dL was associated with leaks in both univariate and
multivariate analysis.14 Telem et al identified five risk factors
in 90 anastomotic leaks in CD with an albumin level less than
3.5 g/dL being the only preoperative risk factor.15
As there are no prospective studies determining preoper￾ative nutritional end points, optimization requires overall
clinical considerations, including albumin levels. Attaining

Abstract Crohn disease is a chronic disease that is treated with aminosalicylates, antibiotics, and
immunosuppressant agents. Most patients ultimately require surgical intervention and
many will require additional surgery for recurrent disease. Consequently, surgery is
generally performed only when medical management fails; however, these patients are
often malnourished and immunosuppressed. Preoperative optimization is necessary to
minimize morbidity, including intra-abdominal septic complications and anastomotic
leaks. In this article, the authors review some considerations to improve the surgical
outcome in Crohn disease.

these levels and correcting other nutritional imbalances can
be facilitated by either enteral or parenteral supplements.
Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) used for at least 18 to 30 days
prior to surgery may reestablish nutritional stores, lower
postoperative complications, decrease the extent of resection
required, or even result in clinical remission of moderate to
severe CD.16–18
Enteral support when possible is preferred due to its more
physiologic nature, diminished cost, and decreased potential
for sepsis when compared with TPN. In addition to correcting
nutritional imbalances, immunonutrition, or nutrition that
enhances immune function, may also induce remission of CD
or reduce the extent of resection needed by decreasing the
inflammatory response. Elemental diets have been evaluated
as a means of inducing disease remission by decreasing
proinflammatory cytokines and serum inflammatory
markers.19 Many studies have shown that remission of dis￾ease can be obtained with an elemental diet, and in some
studies, the elemental diet was found to be more efficacious
than steroids in inducing remission.20–23 Continuation of an
elemental diet in the postoperative period has also been
shown to reduce clinical and endoscopic recurrence of CD
after resection.24
As a supplement, the use of omega-3 fatty acids found in
fish oils may also decrease the production of proinflamma￾tory leukotrienes and prostaglandins by competing with
omega-6 fatty acids in the eicosanoid pathway.25 This has
been shown to reduce the steroid requirements in ulcerative
colitis.26 In CD where C-reactive protein and erythrocyte
sedimentation rate are elevated, omega-3 fatty acids have
been shown to lower production of proinflammatory inter￾feron and prostaglandins; however, there has not been shown
to be a significant effect on disease activity and further
studies on this are warranted.27
Sepsis
Preoperative abdominal sepsis in the form of fistula or
abscess is a common complication of Crohn disease. It may
be seen in up to 10 to 30% cases and is an independent risk
factor for postoperative complications.4–6,28 Traditionally,
abscesses were drained operatively with resection of bowel
and stoma creation commonly performed. However, current
practice is, when possible, to treat abscesses with antibiotics
or percutaneous drainage and antibiotics to avoid surgery in
an acute setting.
Xie et al showed that, compared with a percutaneous
drainage group, those undergoing surgical drainage had
more postoperative complications and a significantly higher
rate of stoma creation.29 During the interval between percu￾taneous drainage and surgery, coexisting metabolic imbal￾ances can be corrected and the reduction of inflammation
minimizes the length of bowel requiring resection and the
potential need for a stoma. Rypens et al demonstrated that
that an interval resection following percutaneous abscess
drainage allows for easier operation with primary anastomo￾sis.30 In some situations, the initial nonoperative approach
may delay the need for surgery or allow for its avoidance
altogether. Gutierrez et al demonstrated that two-thirds of
CD-associated abscesses treated with percutaneous drainage
did not need any surgery for at least 1 year.31 Lee et al
reported on 24 patients admitted with CD abscesses, of
whom 19 were treated nonoperatively, and five by percuta￾neous drainage.32 During a median follow-up of 47.5 months,
12.5% developed recurrent abscesses within 7 months, but
67% required no further intervention.
Immunosuppressive Therapy
Crohn disease is a chronic inflammatory autoimmune con￾dition thought to be the result of aberrant T-cell function, as
well as environmental and/or microbial factors in genetically
susceptible individuals.33 Consequently, a large component
of medical management involves suppression of the immune
response using steroids/glucocorticoids, immunomodula￾tors, and biologic agents. However, these agents contribute
to the challenge in the surgical management of CD due to
conflicting reports of postoperative intra-abdominal septic
complications and anastomotic leaks. As a result, the poten￾tial for this increased risk should be considered intraoper￾atively when determining whether a stoma should be
performed.
Glucocorticoids are mainly used for induction of remission
by controlling acute inflammation in CD. There are conflicting
reports on the overall risk and septic complications due to
preoperative steroid use. Some studies demonstrated an
increased risk of septic complications and anastomotic leaks
due to preoperative steroid use,5,6,28,34–37 while other studies
have found no significant difference.38–40 The lack of uniform
results may represent different patient populations and
comorbidities and well as the definition of steroid use.
Some reports described steroid use as prednisone (or its
equivalent) of 5 mg daily to greater than 40 mg daily, use
within 14 to 60 days prior to surgery, use of 10 mg for at least
4 weeks prior to surgery or use for at least 3 months prior to
surgery.5,36,37,39,40
In addition to the septic concerns related with steroids,
their use can lead to the suppression of the hypothalamus–
pituitary–axis (HPA) and subsequent adrenal insufficiency.
For this reason, perioperative glucocorticoid replacement
may be required. Although it has been traditionally believed
that the degree of suppression was related to the dose and
duration of therapy, poor data to support this exists.41
Glucocorticoids equivalent to 5 mg of prednisone daily or
less and glucocorticoids given for less than 3 weeks do not
appear to cause clinically significant suppression of the HPA
axis.42–44 However, any patient who has received 15 mg of
prednisolone daily or its equivalent for more than 3 weeks
should be suspected of having suppression of the HPA.45
Duration of the degree of HPA suppression once steroids
are stopped is debatable, but may last up to 1 year and
supplemental perioperative glucocorticoids may be required
during this period.46 More accurate evaluation for HPA sup￾pression may be achieved through preoperative corticotropin
testing; however, empiric coverage of a patient at risk may be
more practical.47

Immunomodulators such as cyclosporine have been used
to induce remission of CD, but more commonly, purine
analogs such as 6-MP and azathioprine are used for their
steroid-sparing effects to maintain remission. As with pre￾operative steroid use, there are conflicting experiences with
the use of immunomodulators preoperatively. Myrelid et al
found an increased risk of anastomotic complications in
patients who were on purine analogues (16 vs. 6%) in 343
consecutive CD abdominal operations.48 This risk increased
significantly when combined with other established risk
factors. If combined with colocolonic anastomosis and pre￾operative sepsis, the risk for anastomotic complications
increased to 24%.
Tay et al described 100 consecutive patients undergoing
resection with primary anastomosis or strictureplasty. Sev￾enty patients were treated with azathioprine, 6-MP, or meth￾otrexate within 8 weeks of surgery, with 20 receiving
concomitant biologic therapy.3 Fewer episodes of abdominal
septic complications were found with immunomodulator
therapy (5.6%) compared with those not receiving immuno￾modulation (25%). It was hypothesized that the prior immu￾nomodulator and biologic therapy was more effective at
controlling inflammation than 5-ASA agents, glucocorticoids,
or antibiotics and this provided a protective effect postoper￾atively. Also, additional reports by Colombel et al of 207
patients and Canedo et al of 225 patients undergoing surgery
identified no increase in complications with immunosup￾pressive therapy.39,49
Biologic therapy utilizing monoclonal antibodies directed
at tumor necrosis factor has evolved as a highly effective
treatment for CD.50 Infliximab as maintenance therapy im￾proves the quality of life, facilitates cessation of steroids and
other immunosuppressive drugs, and helps to avoid sur￾gery.51 Preoperative use of biologic therapy has raised con￾cerns due to potential sepsis with its general use, and data
regarding postoperative complications and sepsis shows
conflicting results.
Appau et al showed that the use of biologic agents within
3 months before surgery in CD increases postoperative sepsis,
anastomotic leaks, and readmission rates.52 Other studies,
however, have demonstrated no increase in postoperative
complications associated with biologic use.39,40,49,53,54 Kuni￾take et al evaluated 413 consecutive patients with inflamma￾tory bowel disease (IBD; 188 with CD, 156 with indeterminate
colitis, and 69 with ulcerative colitis) and 101 received
infliximab within 12 weeks of surgery.54 There was no
evidence of any differences in rates of infections, anastomotic
leaks, or other complications. Similarly, Canedo et al demon￾strated no increase in complications in 65 of 225 patients
undergoing surgery for CD who had received infliximab
within 90 days of surgery.39
White et al evaluated 338 consecutive patients who re￾ceived steroids, immunomodulators, or biologic therapy
within 3 months preoperatively and examined unplanned
hospital readmission within 30 days of discharge as an end
point.55 The most common cause for readmission was intra￾abdominal abscess. The incidence of unplanned readmission
was similar among patients treated with steroids (11%),
immunomodulators (9%), and biologics (12%). Steroid use
within 3 months prior to surgery was associated with an
increased rate of unplanned readmission. The use of immu￾nomodulators or biologics alone did not increase readmis￾sion; however, combination therapy did. The incidence of
unplanned readmissions was 3, 7, 11, and 16% when 0, 1, 2, or
3 agents used. The increasingly greater need for preoperative
immunosuppression may result in greater overall immuno￾suppression that increases the risk for postoperative morbid￾ity and readmission and this should be part of the surgical
consideration.
Smoking
CD is more common in smokers than in nonsmokers, and its
effects are dose-dependent and related to the nicotine within
the tobacco smoke.56–58 However, preoperative smoking does
not appear to increase the incidence of anastomotic leaks.3,5
Yamamoto and Keighley did find that smokers have a twofold
increase in postoperative CD recurrence compared with non￾smokers, with recurrences being dose dependent.59 The
recurrence rate was also greater in those with a longer
smoking history and in women compared with men. Former
smokers have a similar recurrence rate as nonsmokers; hence,
smoking cessation should be part of the preoperative
optimization.
Venous Thromboembolism Prophylaxis
As with all abdominal and pelvic surgery, VTE prophylaxis, as
suggested by the American College of Chest Physicians Evi￾dence–Based Clinical Practice Guidelines (9th edition),
should be considered.60 In population-based studies, the
risk for deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism in
IBD patients was two- to threefold greater than the general
population and pharmacologic prophylaxis may not be suffi￾cient.61–63 Consequently, patients with CD requiring surgery
may be at high risk for VTE, and the combination of mechani￾cal and pharmacologic prophylaxis should be considered
unless contraindicated.
Conclusion
CD is a chronic condition that is treated with antibiotics, anti￾inflammatory agents, and immunosuppressant therapy. Most
patients will ultimately require surgery; many may require
multiple surgeries. As a result, surgery is deferred until
absolutely necessary and the patient has exhausted nonop￾erative management. For this reason, patients may not be in
optimal preoperative condition due to malnutrition, sepsis, or
immunosuppression. If the clinical situation permits, surgery
should be delayed until achievement of a good functional
status, by correction of nutritional imbalances with either
enteral or parenteral support, and by treating intra-abdomi￾nal sepsis with radiographically guided drainage and anti￾biotics. Postoperative infection and/or anastomotic leak with
the prior use of immunosuppressive therapy should be
considered, and the need for diversion should be

individualized based upon the patient’s overall condition and
presence of additional risk factors. Unique concerns related to
adrenal insufficiency, tobacco use, and increased risk for VTE
should be considered as well.
