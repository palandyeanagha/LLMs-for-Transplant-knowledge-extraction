SUMMARY Patients with methylmalonic aciduria have an excessive intramitochondrial accumulation
of acylcoenzyme A compounds that may reduce the availability of free coenzyme A (CoA) for
normal metabolic requirements, producing profound metabolic disturbances. Giving carnitine to a
patient with methylmalonic aciduria produced an increase in hippurate excretion (an index of
intramitochondrial adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and CoA availability), a large increase in short
chain urinary acylcarnitines, and a reduction in excretion of methylmalonate and methylcitrate.
These acylcarnitines were shown by fast atom bombardment and B/E linked scan mass spectrometry
to be propionylcarnitine and acetylcarnitine. Carnitine acts by removing (detoxifying) propionyl
groups, thereby releasing CoA and restoring ATP biosynthesis and concentrations towards normal.
L-carnitine may play a central role in maintenance of mitochondrial and cellular homoeostasis in
methylmalonic aciduria and propionic acidaemia. These principles may provide an approach to the
treatment of this and other disorders, inherited and acquired, in which accumulation of acyl CoA
metabolites results in sequestration of free CoA, thereby perturbing metabolic homoeostasis.
Recent reports indicate the potential need for
supplementary carnitine in patients with several
disorders of intermediary metabolism, particularly
those associated with the organic acidurias.1-3
Many of these latter disorders are associated with
the accumulation of short chain acylcarnitines
(Chalmers, Roe, Hoppel, and Stacey, unpublished
data). Carnitine was administered to a child with
methylmalonic aciduria because of the clinical
benefit seen after giving L-carnitine to another
patientwithpropionicacidaemia.Propionicacidaemia
and methylmalonic aciduria have in common the
accumulation of propionyl coenzyme A (CoA) and
its metabolites, with their untoward metabolic
effects. We believe that there is an increased carnitine
requirement in methylmalonic aciduria, we detail
the beneficial effects on intermediary metabolism
after giving carnitine, and identify acylcarnitines
excreted in large quantities after carnitine supple￾mentation. This study supports a role for carnitine in
the management of patients with this disorder and
those with propionic acidaemia.
This study was approved by the ethical committee
of Northwick Park Hospital and the Clinical
Research Centre, Harrow.
Clinical description
The patient, a girl, was the first child of unrelated
caucasian parents. After a normal pregnancy,
delivery at term was complicated by breech pres￾entation requiring caesarean section. She was
breastfed initially, but on day three of life she
became tachypnoeic and hypotonic, and proceeded
into coma with profound metabolic acidosis (base
deficit, 21 mmol/l). Gasliquid chromatography of
her urine and blood plasma followed by mass
spectrometry gave a diagnosis of methylmalonic
aciduria, and this was confirmed by enzymology
on cultured skin fibroblasts. Attempts to treat with

vitamin B12 (1 mg daily IM) failed to improve her
clinical or metabolic presentation. She was sub￾sequently managed by restriction of natural protein
intake (up to 1 g/kg body weight daily) with supple￾mentary amino acids (devoid of isoleucine, valine,
threonine, and methonine) at a value equivalent to
an additional 1 g protein/kg body weight, daily.
Supplementary vitamins and minerals were included,
with additional calories provided by carbohydrate
polymer and lipid. Her postnatal course was
characterised by multiple hospital admissions for
metabolic regulation, complicated by anorexia and
recurrent vomiting associated with intermittent
upper gastrointestinal bleeding. She has generally
delayed development with particular delay in speech,
and poor muscle tone and power. At the time of the
study she was 21 months old, with a developmental
age of 11 months, height <3rd centile, weight
3rd-lOth centile, and head circumference 50th
centile
Methods
Urinary organic acids were quantitatively extracted
using DEAE-Sephadex and established procedures,4
and they were analysed by capillary gas chromato￾graphy of their trimethylsilyl (TMS) and TMS￾ethoxime derivatives on 25 m fused silica columns
coated with a non-polar chemically bonded poly￾methylsiloxane (CP-SIL-5, Chrompak, UK London).
A split injection (70:1) of 2 Vu1 sample at 200°C was
temperature programmed at 6°C/min from
70°-250°C. The carrier gas was helium, 1-4 ml/min.
Components were identified using retention indices,
and quantified using n-tetracosane as a standard.
Identifications were subsequently confirmed using
capillary gas chromatography mass spectrometry.
Plasma and urinary carnitine and acylcarnitines
were determined by radioenzymatic assay utilising
[1-14C]-acetyl-CoA and carnitine acetyltransferase,
according to the method of Brass and Hoppel.5
Acylcarnitines in plasma were separated into an acid
soluble fraction (short chain acylcarnitines) and an
acid insoluble fraction (long chain acylcarnitines).
The results are expressed in ,umol/l for plasma and
nmol/mg creatinine for urine.
Acetylcarnitine and propionylcarnitine were
synthesised according to the method of Bohmer
and Bremer,6 using the acylchlorides and L-carnitine
under reflux conditions followed by multiple
recrystallisations. Aqueous eluates from urine
samples passed over Dowex-1 colums at neutrality7
and concentrated by lyophilisation were analysed by
fast atom bombardment (FAB) mass spectrometry,8
using xenon gas and samples in a glycerol matrix
with a VG 7070 HS mass spectrometer. Acyl￾carnitines were further analysed by linked scanning
at constant B/E ratios that provided an independent
fragmentation pattern for each major ion in the
mass spectrum.9
At the time of the study, although requiring
nasogastric tube feeding, the child was under
reasonably good metabolic control as shown by
normal plasma glucose, ammonia, electrolyte,
acid base status, and by urinary organic acids.
D, L-camitine, 12.4 mmol (200 mg/kg body weight)
was given as a single oral dose representing 100
mg/kg of the L-isomer (the isomer measured in the
radioenzymatic assay).
Results
Before being given supplementary carnitine the
child's plasma showed a total carnitine of 53.2
,umol/l (normal, mean (SD) 46 1 (10X0) l,mol/l),
free carnitine 35.8 F±mol/l (normal, mean (SD)
36.7 (7.6) ,umol/l), acid soluble (short chain)
acylcarnitines 17.1 ,umol/l (normal, mean (SD)
5.7 (3.5) ,umol/1), and acid insoluble (long chain)
acylcarnitines 0 3 t±mol/l (normal, mean (SD)
3.7 (1*5) ,umol/l).10 These results show normal
plasma free carnitine values but considerably
raised short chain acylcarnitines.
In the urine, free carnitine was 142 nmol/mg
creatinine (normal, mean (SD) 51.3 (40-1) nmol/mg
creatinine) and combined acylcarnitines were 352
nmol/mg creatinine (normal, mean (SD) 73.7
(39.5) nmol/mg creatinine), giving a total urinary
carnitine of 494 nmol/mg creatinine (normal, mean
(SD) 125.1 (74.7) nmol/mg creatinine). The urine
therefore showed increased excretion of both free
carnitine and acylcarnitines.
After giving carnitine, urine samples were collected
sequentially over a 24 hour period for organic acid
analysis and acylcarnitine measurements. During
this period, 476 ,umol of carnitine, as free and
acylcarnitines, were excreted in the urine. This
amount represented 8-1 % of the ingested dose.
The total carnitines excreted comprised 269 [±mol
free and 207 ,umol acylcarnitines. Urinary free
carnitine excretion paralleled acylcarnitine excretion
throughout the study period. Most of the excretion
77.2 %-occurred in the first 12 hours.
Although there were no notable fluctuations in
other metabolites, there were major changes in
urinary hippurate, methylmalonate, methylcitrate,
and acylcarnitines during the first 12 hours (Fig. 1).
There was a rapid 6 fold increase in hippurate
concentration at 30 minutes after the dose, with apeak
value attained at 3 hours, and the values decreasing
thereafter. In contrast, there was a less than twofold
increase in acylcarnitine excretion by 30 minutes,

but then a rapid excretion took place by five hours,
representing a 24 fold increase over the baseline
value. As the acylcarnitine excretion increased, both
methylmalonate and methylcitrate excretion
decreased progressively, by 43 % and 57 %
respectively compared with earlier values at 30
minutes. Plasma carnitine analysis at this time
showed major changes in short chain acylcarnitine
concentrations, from 17.1 Fmol/l before carnitine
supplementation to 27*4 ,umol/l afterwards. Free
carnitine increased from 35*8 to 66.1 ,umol/J.
There was no appreciable change in plasma long
chain acylcarnitines. The relation between urinary
acylcarnitines and the metabolites, methylmalonate
and methylcitrate, persisted for 12 hours, by which
time the metabolites had returned to their previous
high values, and acylcarnitine excretion had
decreased.
The reciprocal relation and temporal sequence
between the metabolites, methylmalonate and
methylcitrate, and urinary acylcarnitines suggested
the possibility of removal of a short chain acyl CoA
precursor to the organic acid metabolites. Fast atom
bombardment (FAB) mass spectrometry, an
ionisation technique particularly useful for highly
polar solids, was used for investigation of the
chemical nature of the acylcarnitines. The acyl￾carnitines exhibit intense parent cations of the type
(CH3)3 N CH2CH (OR)CH2CO2H (R=acetyl, pro￾pionyl, etc) with prominent fragment ions at
m/z 58, 85, 100, and 144. The characteristic parent
ions for acetylcarnitine and propionylcarnitine have
m/z values of 204 and 218, respectively. These
compounds characteristically produce a major
fragment corresponding to M-59. The FAB spectrum
of a urine sample obtained at the peak of acyl￾carnitine excretion (5 hours) showed prominent
ions at m/z 218, 204, and 162 (Fig 2(a)). The other
fragment ions such as m/z 58, 85 etc, are also seen in
this mass spectrum. Accurate mass measurements of

using a glycerol matrix ion (m/z 185.1025) for
reference gave the following values: (a) 218.1390
consistent with the calculated mass of 218.1392 for
propionylcarnitine (C,oH2004N), (b) 204.1231 con￾sistent with the calculated mass of 204.1236 for
acetylcarnitine (CqH1804N), and (c) 162.1114
consistent with the calculated mass of 162.1130 for
free carnitine (C7H1603N).
Further evidence for the presence of propionyl￾carnitine and acetylcarnitine was provided by linked
scanning at a constant B/E ratio9 that produces an
independent fragmentation pattern for each major
ion in a mass spectrum. The constant B/E linked scan
spectra for the m/z 218 ions from synthetic pro￾pionylcarnitine and the urine extract are compared
in Fig. 2(b) and (c), respectively. Similarly, com￾parison of the linked scan spectra of synthetic
acetylcarnitine, m/z 204, and that ion in the urine
are shown in Fig. 2(d) and (e), respectively. The
similarities in these linked scans between the syn￾thesised acylcarnitines and those excreted by the
patient seem identical. In each case the characteristic
loss of 59 daltons corresponding to (CH3)3N is seen.
The m/z 218 produces the m/z 159 from propionyl￾carnitine while the m/z 204 yields the m/z 145 from
acetylcarnitine.
Discussion
Carnitine supplementation in this child with
methylmalonic aciduria was considered because of
the beneficial clinical and metabolic effects noted
after carnitine was given to another patient with
propionic acidaemia.1 Both propionic acidaemia and
methylmalonic aciduria are disorders associated with
the accumulation of acyl CoA compounds inside the
mitochondria. Most metabolites excreted in these
disorders share a common precursor, propionyl
CoA.4 This compound and its metabolites are
known to produce a variety of metabolic distur￾bances. These include inhibition of the tricarboxylic
acid (TCA) cycle,11 12 reduced guanosine tri￾phosphate (GTP) synthesis by inhibition of
succinate: CoA ligase (GDP) and hence re￾duced regeneration of ADP from adenosine
monophosphate (AMP) via GTP: AMP trans￾phosphorylase,13 and uncoupling of oxidative
phosphorylation by propionate. All of these processes
would result in reduced ATP synthesis. Propionyl
CoA also inhibits the pyruvate dehydrogenase
complex,14 N-acetylglutamate synthetase,15 and the
glycine cleaveage system.'6 During a catabolic
state, which would be associated with increased
production of propionyl CoA, these inhibitory
actions would have major effects on intermediary
metabolism including pyruvate entry into the TCA
cycle, activity of the cycle itself, the elimination of
ammonia by the urea cycle, and the production of
methylene units from glycine cleaveage. These
metabolic disturbances lead to the clinical features
that may be observed in these patients, associated,
with hypoglycaemia, hyperammonaemia, and hyper￾glycinaemia.4 Thus the most logical strategic
approach to treatment would be the elimination of
propionyl groups.
Before being given carnitine the patient had a
normal plasma free carnitine concentration, as￾sociated with increased short chain acylcarnitines.
Her urine contained increased concentrations of
both free carnitine and acylcarnitines. These
results indicate that she was able to synthesise
carnitine and utilise it in the formation of acyl￾carnitines. However, the excessive excretion of
acylcarnitines in the presence of continued excretion
of abnormal organic acids suggests she may have
insufficient L-carnitine available for her increased
metabolic requirements imposed by the intra￾mitochondrial accumulation of propionyl CoA.
Supplementation with carnitine resulted in an
increase of acylcarnitine excretion to very high
values, with a concomitant reduction in urinary
methylmalonic acid and methylcitric acid excretion.
The major acylcarnitine excreted was shown to be
propionylcarnitine, suggesting that removal of
propionyl groups is directly responsible for the
metabolic changes obserevd.
These results indicate L-carnitine may play a
central role in maintenance of mitochondrial and
cellular homoeostasis in methylmalonic aciduria and
in propionic acidaemia-both disorders in which
propionyl groups accumulate as propionyl CoA
with sequestration of intramitochondrial CoA.
Giving exogenous carnitine and removal of this
accumulating propionyl CoA results in release of free
CoA with restoration of mitochondrial homo￾eostasis. This is reflected in the initial and immediate
response to supplementary carnitine and the sudden
and profound increase in hippurate formation and
excretion. Intramitochondrial biosynthesis of
hippurate from benzoate is dependent upon avail￾ability of both CoA and ATP17 and this dramatic
increase in hippurate excretion indicates that L￾camitine acts by removing propionyl groups, and
restoring intramitochondrial CoA and ATP concen￾trations towards normal.'8 Benzoate, itself an
uncoupler of oxidative phosphorylation, must be
accumulating in the mitochondria in these disorders
because of the inadequate supply of CoA and ATP.
Benzoate treatment of hyperammonaemia in patients
with disorders of organic acid metabolism, as in the
primary hyperammonaemia syndromes,1920 would
be contraindicated without greatly supplemented
L-carnitine cotherapy.

Thus the majorproblems in methylmalonic aciduria
and propionic acidaemia are: (a) lack of availability
of CoA, (b) diminished ATP production, and
(c) insufficient L-carnitine for the patients' increased
metabolic requirements. All of these are caused by
the accumulation of propionyl CoA. Since we have
shown that propionyl groups can be detoxified and
eliminated in the urine as propionylcarnitine, we
propose the use of supplementary L-carnitine in the
long term management of these diseases. With
adequate supplementary L-carnitine, a mechanism is
provided whereby flux of propionylcarnitine
(formation and excretion) may be made to equal
the excess accumulation of propionyl CoA when
dietary protein intake is only moderately restricted.
These principles may apply to the treatment of a
wide group of disorders-some inherited, such as
the organic acidurias and some acquired, such as
Reye's syndrome21-in all of which accumulation of
various acyl CoA metabolites results in the sequestra￾tion of CoA, thereby perturbing metabolic
homoeostasis.
This study was supported in part by a grant from the National
Reye's Syndrome Foundation, Bryan, Ohio; the Reye's
Syndrome Research Fund-SFA (Duke University Medical
Center); and grants from the National Institutes of Health￾AM 15804 and the Muscular Dystrophy Association.
