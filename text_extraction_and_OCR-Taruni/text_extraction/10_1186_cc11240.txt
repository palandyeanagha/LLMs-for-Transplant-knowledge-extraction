Many terms have been used to describe acute events 
occurring to or involving the kidneys, such as acute renal 
failure, acute kidney diseases, acute kidney syndromes, 
or acute kidney injury (AKI). Indeed, the spectrum of 
such disorders has been expanding over the last decades. 
Th e diagnosis and management of acute syndromes 
involving the kidneys has become a multidisciplinary 
fi eld concerning not only nephrology and urology but 
also critical care medicine, cardiology, radiology, and 
other fi elds. With this evolution, the term acute renal 
failure, used for many years in clinical practice, has been 
replaced with the term AKI. Th e new term implies 
potentially reversible kidney injury or damage occurring 
in a time frame of hours or days and characterizing the 
disorder as ‘acute’. Although the term ‘injury’ would not 
necessarily encompass kidney dysfunction without 
damage, the diagnosis of AKI syndrome is still made on 
the basis of a change in serum creatinine or urine output, 
both likely deriving from an altered glomerular fi ltration 
and therefore identifying more a dysfunction than 
damage. Histopathological changes during AKI have 
been studied [1], but mostly in animal experiments. In 
fact, histopathological criteria are diffi cult to apply to the 
diagnosis of AKI in critically ill patients in whom kidney 
biopsy is usually considered to carry an inappropriate 
risk-to-benefi t ratio. Only recently, some attention has 
been given to signs of structural damage to the nephrons 
and its clinical relevance [2].
Th ere are many reasons why a distinction should be 
made between kidney injury and dysfunction. Indeed, 
human kidneys have an important functional reserve; 
thus, dysfunction, especially when defi ned as an altered 
glomerular fi ltration, becomes evident only when more 
than 50% of the renal mass is compromised. Th e rise in 
serum creatinine is a sign of a glomerular fi ltration 
alteration that has been ongoing for hours or days. In the 
case of a transient decrease in glomerular fi ltration rate 
(GFR), creatinine may never rise signifi cantly. On the 
other hand, a rise in serum creatinine may occur in the 
presence of a constant creatinine generation when 
glomerular fi ltration has been impaired for at least 24 to 
48  hours. Th e new steady state and the new level of 
serum creatinine will be set by the new level of 
glomerular fi ltration; at the new steady state, excretion 
will equal generation, but the required excretion will 
occur at the expense of a signifi cantly higher creatinine 
level. Standard AKI classifi cations such as the RIFLE 
(Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss, and End-stage kidney disease) 
criteria [3] or modifi ed RIFLE criteria [4] include as a 
diagnostic criterion even slight changes in serum 
Abstract
The concept of acute kidney syndromes has shifted 
in recent years from acute renal failure to acute 
kidney injury (AKI). AKI implies injury or damage 
but not necessarily dysfunction. The human kidney 
has an important glomerular function reserve, and 
dysfunction becomes evident only when more than 
50% of the renal mass is compromised. Recent AKI 
classifi cations include even slight changes in serum 
creatinine, acknowledging that this condition is 
associated with worse outcomes. This, however, still 
represents a functional criterion for AKI and implies a 
glomerular fi ltration rate alteration that may be a late 
phenomenon in the time course of the syndrome. 
An early diagnosis of AKI by using tubular damage 
biomarkers preceding fi ltration function loss is 
possible today. Some studies have shown evidence 
that there is an additional value of new biomarkers 
not only because they allow a diagnosis to be made 
earlier but also because they allow a kidney injury 
to be diagnosed even in the absence of subsequent 
dysfunction. Only recently, tubular damage without 
glomerular function loss was demonstrated to be 
associated with worse renal and overall outcomes. 
For this condition, the term ‘subclinical’ AKI has been 
introduced, challenging the traditional view that a 
kidney problem is clinically relevant, only when a loss 
of fi ltration function becomes apparent. A new domain 
of AKI diagnosis could then include functional criteria 
and damage criteria. This may have an impact on the 
epidemiology, prevention, and management of AKI.

creatinine (as low as 0.3 mg/dL), and validation studies of 
these criteria show that such conditions are associated 
with worse outcomes [5]. Once again, these approaches, 
though refi ned in comparison with previous criteria of 
diagnosis (often described by doubling serum creatinine 
or the need for dialysis), are still based on functional 
criteria and imply an altered GFR. Such alteration may 
have occurred long after the injury has taken place and 
long before the creatinine has reached the new higher 
steady level. Th is explains why a rise in serum creatinine 
is often a sign of severe kidney damage even if the rise in 
creatinine is minimal. In such a condition, information 
on the magnitude of tubular damage and other kidney 
tissues and functions is often not available.
Very recently, signifi cant contributions to the literature 
have shown that an early diagnosis of AKI can be made 
by using a single structural or functional biomarker (or a 
combination thereof) capable of detecting kidney injury 
almost in real time [6]. Many studies with several 
thousands of patients have shown evidence that there is 
an additional value of new biomarkers not only because 
they allow a diagnosis to be made earlier [7] but also 
because they allow a kidney injury to be diagnosed even 
in the absence of a subsequent manifest dysfunction 
[2,8]. What are the ideal characteristics for such bio￾markers? Th ey must be specifi c for kidney injury, sensi￾tive enough to detect even less severe insults, easy and 
rapid to measure, and inexpensive enough to make their 
use sustainable. A series of molecules have been evalu￾ated over the years, and signifi cant advances have been 
made in the fi eld. Molecules such as NGAL (neutrophil 
gelatinase-associated lipocalin), KIM-1 (kidney injury 
molecule-1), and Cys-C (cystatin-C) have demonstrated a 
peculiar capacity to detect an injury to the kidney well 
before the rise in serum creatinine can be observed. 
Th us, a new diagnostic approach to acute kidney syn￾dromes can be envisaged. Such a biomarker-driven 
approach raises the question of whether AKI could be 
diagnosed even in the absence of the classic signs that 
have characterized the syndrome in the past. In other 
words, if we compare AKI with the acute coronary 
syndrome, in which an increase in troponin may be a 
suffi cient trigger for a diagnosis and a therapeutic 
intervention, the diagnosis of AKI could be made even in 
the absence of oliguria or increased creatinine levels. Th e 
fact that AKI is not clinically manifest does not 
necessarily mean that the kidney is intact and that the 
function is perfect. A subclinical entity may be unveiled 
by the new biomarkers and we should still call this entity 
AKI. In these circumstances, revised RIFLE or Acute 
Kidney Injury Network (AKIN) criteria should integrate 
one or more injury markers with creatinine, urine output, 
and/or other functional markers. Th is concept was 
recently proposed, expanding the spectrum of clinical 
conditions under the umbrella of AKI [9]. Today, we do 
not have suffi cient data to characterize the severity of the 
syndrome on the basis of structural biomarker levels 
alone and therefore the grading of the syndrome still 
relies on renal function markers. Nevertheless, this 
should not mean that we can neglect a clinical condition 
characterized by positive bio marker and negative 
creatinine fi ndings. In practice, we have a new class or 
stage of AKI that is diagnosed by tubular damage 
biomarkers such as NGAL and that may or may not 
evolve into a clinically manifest syndrome characterized 
by decreased GFR and increased serum creatinine. At 
this point, one would be tempted to call this AKIN stage 
0 but this would imply no AKI. Th e same is true for a 
possible RIFLE 0 condition. In this substantial and not 
merely semantic discussion, we may speculate that AKIN 
stages better describe the severity of the syndrome, not 
because they signifi cantly diff er from RIFLE stages but 
because the terms ‘risk’ and ‘injury’, typical of RIFLE, may 
lead to confusion. In fact, if a biomarker-positive, 
creatinine-negative patient is observed, he or she has 
probably received an ‘injury’ to his kidney but may still be 
in a preclinical (according to creatinine) phase. For this 
reason, we propose an additional criterion to the classic 
RIFLE or AKIN criteria since both are basically function￾driven: the new criterion is injury-driven and identifi es a 
sub clinical AKI that, however, is defi nitely an AKI. Th e 
new criterion also enables a timely diagnosis of ‘prerenal’ 
AKI and a more precise distinction of the term since 
during such a condition tubular damage biomarkers are 
negative but simultaneously a loss of fi ltration function is 
evident [6,10]. For example, hypovolemia due to reduced 
fl uid intake or increased fl uid loss may cause a reduction 
in GFR, but the integrity and polarity of tubular cells may 
be preserved in the absence of infl ammation or ischemia. 
None theless, a prolonged and severe hypovolemia in 
patients with comorbidities may contribute to tubular 
damage, especially when hypoperfusion develops.
Isolated function loss or isolated damage, when 
occurring alone, is each suffi cient to constitute AKI, and 
the two occurring together – regardless of which one 
occurs fi rst – may progress to a combined function loss 
and damage. Table 1 presents the entities of AKI syndrome 
on the basis of renal fi ltration function and tubular damage 
markers.
Th is new approach has several implications. First, the 
diagnosis of AKI may include a larger spectrum of 
conditions, and the epidemiology of the syndrome may 
well change in terms of incidence and prevalence. In fact, 
a larger number of individuals may fall within the 
defi nition of AKI if function and injury criteria are used 
for diagnosis. Second, the concept of prevention or early 
organ protection or both may change, and we might be 
able to rewrite several sections of the chapter on

pre ventive measures for AKI. Several interventions, in 
fact, have failed to provide positive results, even when 
pre vious laboratory and animal data were extremely 
encouraging. Th is may have to do with the timing in 
which the prevention/protection measure is applied. Th e 
condition in which a tubular damage biomarker is 
positive, even in the absence of a rise in serum creatinine 
(subclinical AKI), may become suffi cient to trigger 
interventions and protective strategies for the kidney. 
(Th is was not possible before, because we used only 
biomarkers of dysfunction, like creatinine, which are a 
mirror of a late phenomenon. Th us, interventions done 
in the past were always done too late.) Th ird, we may 
need to re-establish a term for renal function loss (for 
example, acute renal dysfunction), distinguishing it from 
AKI with tubular damage, or at least to provide a new 
staging classifi cation (subclinical AKI for patients who 
are biomarker-positive and creatinine-negative). Fourth, 
the accuracy and timeliness of diff erential diagnosis of 
the underlying cause of AKI (prerenal versus non￾prerenal) may be improved.
More considerations on the concept of ‘biomarker 
posi tivity’ are needed. Biomarkers are becoming more 
and more reliable in terms of sensitivity and specifi city, 
and even high-sensitivity assays with extended range are 
becoming available. Th ese new assays have improved the 
capability of damage detection even below the classic 
cutoff values [11]. In such circumstances, sequential 
measure ments may be indicated to build biomarker 
curves capable of identifying trends characteristic of a 
transient or ongoing renal insult. Th is may open up a new 
frontier in the diagnosis of AKI and its consequences in 
terms of prevention and therapeutic strategies.
In conclusion, we are living in a post-creatinine world 
where creatinine should not be abandoned but we should 
move beyond it. What today is considered subclinical 
AKI (tubular damage biomarker positivity without dys￾func tion) can, thanks to the new biomarkers, be defi ned 
as AKI and we cannot aff ord to neglect such conditions 
when they are associated with negative outcomes. Th e 
accuracy of new biomarkers is crucial in this process, and 
we should start considering not only cutoff values but 
also trends and biomarker curves, especially now that 
high-sensitivity assays are becoming available. In other 
words, we must consider that subclinical AKI is still AKI.
