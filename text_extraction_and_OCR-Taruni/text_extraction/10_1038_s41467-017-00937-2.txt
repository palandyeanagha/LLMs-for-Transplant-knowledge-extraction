Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are renoprotective and drive regeneration following
injury, although cellular targets of such an effect are still ill-defined. Here, we show that
human umbilical cord (UC)-MSCs transplanted into mice stimulate tubular cells to regain
mitochondrial mass and function, associated with enhanced microtubule-rich projections that
appear to mediate mitochondrial trafficking to create a reparative dialogue among adjacent
tubular cells. Treatment with UC-MSCs in mice with cisplatin-induced acute kidney injury
(AKI) regulates mitochondrial biogenesis in proximal tubuli by enhancing PGC1α expression,
NAD+ biosynthesis and Sirtuin 3 (SIRT3) activity, thus fostering antioxidant defenses and
ATP production. The functional role of SIRT3 in tubular recovery is highlighted by data that in
SIRT3-deficient mice with AKI, UC-MSC treatment fails to induce renoprotection. These data
document a previously unrecognized mechanism through which UC-MSCs facilitate renal
repair, so as to induce global metabolic reprogramming of damaged tubular cells to sustain
energy supply.

Mammalian kidneys, unlike those of fish and amphibians,
have a limited capacity to repair, which becomes
apparent when the damage is structurally and func￾tionally confined to a small portion of the nephron1, 2. A
meaningful example of the capacity of the mammalian kidney to
regenerate is offered by the exuberant tubular cell proliferation
that occurs during recovery from acute kidney injury (AKI)1.
Advances in regenerative medicine have supported this paradigm,
documenting in a convincing way that therapy with mesenchymal
stromal cells (MSCs) can accelerate the kidney repair program
after acute injury. This phenomenon is independent of MSC
differentiation in the kidney but likely linked to paracrine effects

of infused stromal cells on renal resident cells3, 4. Thus, results
from studies in several experimental models of AKI have shown
that treatments with rodent and human MSCs of different origins
have an amazing protective effect on renal function impairment
and structural damage, by reducing apoptosis and activating
tubular cell turnover5–9. These renoprotective effects are linked to
the MSC capacity to migrate to the site of renal damage and to
release extracellular vesicles and pro-survival, anti-inflammatory,
and immunomodulatory factors locally5–9. However, the precise
intracellular renal targets responsible for the observed regen￾erative effects of MSC therapy have not been fully identified and
conclusive mechanistic studies are still lacking. This is a critical
issue, given that, sooner or later, clinical studies will be designed
to give MSCs to patients with acute and even chronic renal
dysfunction, with the aim of enhancing the regenerative capacity
of the kidney. This has already been done to some extent, and the
results are not always easy to interpret10. Hence, further inves￾tigations are needed to fully uncover the therapeutic potential of
MSCs and to promote their safe use in humans.
The starting point for our present study is the observation that
mitochondria dysregulation is a common early event preceding
cell functional loss and death. Of all the nephron segments,
the proximal tubular epithelium is endowed with the highest
mitochondrial density due to its high-energy functions in
active transport11–13. Tubular cells are the major targets of
AKI, in which mitochondrial fission is coupled to membrane
depolarization and permeabilization, with the release of apopto￾genic factors associated with radical oxygen species (ROS)
generation11, 14. The impairment of mitochondrial structural
integrity ultimately results in ATP depletion and cytoskeletal
changes, leading to the breakdown of the brush border, loss of
cell–cell contact, and tubular epithelial cell detachment11–16.
Microtubules, one of the primary components of the cytoskele￾ton, have been described to regulate intracellular mitochondrial
distribution17–19. Together, the dysregulation of both functional
and structural integrity of mitochondria is the critical early event
responsible for tissue injury occurring during AKI and the pro￾gression of the disease11, 14, 20.
Several studies have discovered that different mitochondrial
processes such as energy production21, 22 and antioxidant
defences23 are critically dependent on Sirtuin 3 (SIRT3) due to its
deacetylase activity24. We have previously documented that
extended lifespan in mice is associated with reduced oxidative
damage, increased mitochondrial number, and the upregulation
of SIRT3 in the kidney25. In line with this evidence, SIRT3
downregulation was associated with the development of age￾associated disorders such as metabolic syndrome26. More recently
we also uncovered the role of SIRT3 as a master regulator of
injury and repair through the preservation of mitochondrial
dynamics in AKI20, 27. Pharmacological manipulations with
agents able to restore renal SIRT3 levels and impaired mito￾chondrial dynamics ultimately resulted in kidney repair in the
AKI animals20.
With this background, the aim of this study was to investigate
whether the effects of human umbilical cord-derived (UC) MSCs
to accelerate renal repair in rodents were dependent on the
restoration of SIRT3 expression and activity, thus regulating
mitochondrial function and distribution in the proximal tubular
cell compartment. Here, we report a mechanism through which
cell-based therapy induced kidney repair by enhancing SIRT3,
thus preserving mitochondria functional integrity, a condition
that is indispensable for the microtubule-dependent organelle
trafficking among injured tubular epithelial cells to restore their
bioenergetic profile during AKI.
Results
UC-MSCs foster repair and replenish mitochondria in AKI.
Immunodeficient mice injected with cisplatin developed severe
renal function impairment (Supplementary Fig. 1A) and proximal
tubular injury consisting of hyaline casts, tubular cell degenera￾tion, and necrosis at 4 days (Supplementary Fig. 1B, C). The
intravenous administration of human UC-MSCs 1 day after cis￾platin treatment exerted a renoprotective effect to the extent that
renal function, evaluated as blood urea nitrogen (BUN),
improved and signs of tubular damage were reduced (Supple￾mentary Fig. 1A–C). Transplanted human UC-MSCs engrafted
injured mouse renal tissues with a frequency averaging 1.6 ± 0.26
human nuclear antigen (HNA)-positive MSCs/105 renal cells and
distributed predominantly in the peritubular areas (Supplemen￾tary Fig. 1D, E). Electron microscopy micrographs of proximal
tubuli in cisplatin mice revealed that mitochondria fragmented
into short rods or spheres, unlike the elongated organelles
observed in control tissues (Fig. 1a). Morphometric analysis also
indicated that mitochondria rarefied in cisplatin mice compared
to controls (Fig. 1b). Treatment with UC-MSCs normalized
mitochondrial shape (Fig. 1a) and density (Fig. 1b). There was a
consistent and important decrease in the mitochondrial mass—
assessed as citrate synthase activity—in tubular epithelial cells of
AKI mice, which was restored by UC-MSC infusion (Fig. 1c).

All the above beneficial effects were specific for UC-MSCs, since
human fibroblast infusion did not protect mice with cisplatin￾induced AKI from renal functional and structural impairment,
and mitochondrial fragmentation (Supplementary Fig. 2A–C)
UC-MSCs preserve mitochondria in tubular cells. We set up an
in vitro model of tubular cell injury by using human renal
proximal tubular epithelial cells (RPTECs) exposed to cisplatin
and then co-cultured with or without UC-MSCs in a transwell
system (see scheme in Fig. 1d). As it occurs in vivo6, 8, 28, cisplatin
exerted its cytotoxic effect by reducing the number of living
RPTECs (Supplementary Fig. 3A) and by inhibiting their pro￾liferation at 24 h (Supplementary Fig. 3B). The expression of
the apoptotic marker cleaved caspase-3 was increased 24 h after
cisplatin exposure compared to resting cells (Supplementary
Fig. 3C). Co-culture with UC-MSCs increased tubular cell num￾ber and proliferation, and reduced the apoptotic cells (Supple￾mentary Fig. 3A–C).
Since tubular injury is closely associated with mitochondrial
dysfunction11–14, we examined the functional and structural
integrity of mitochondria. Cisplatin-damaged RPTECs showed
massive mitochondrial fragmentation as early as at 6 h (Supple￾mentary Fig. 3D), which was still detected at 24 h (Fig. 1e) when
81% of cisplatin-exposed RPTECs exhibited round-shaped
fragmented mitochondria compared with the filamentous net￾work of elongated mitochondria of control cells. Then, we
assessed mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm) using the
potential-sensor JC-1, which shifts from green to red in the
emission spectrum, reflecting cytoplasmic vs mitochondrial
distribution. Cisplatin induced massive tubular mitochondrial
depolarization, as evidenced by diffuse cytoplasmic JC-1 at 6 h
(Supplementary Fig. 3E), which was also stably recorded after 24
h (Fig. 1f). The co-culture of cisplatin-treated RPTECs with UC￾MSCs restored tubular mitochondrial dynamics markedly by
reducing fragmentation (Fig. 1e) and normalizing RPTEC
mitochondrial membrane potential (Fig. 1f) at 24 h. Consistently,
a reduction in mitochondrial mass was observed in cisplatin￾treated RPTECs at 24 h, which was reversed by the UC-MSCs
(Fig. 1g), suggesting that mitochondria are critical targets of MSC
regenerative activity. At variance, co-culture of injured RPTECs
with human fibroblasts, here used as control cells, did not result
in amelioration of mitochondrial structural and functional
integrity (Supplementary Fig. 2D–G).
UC-MSCs induce tubular cell transcriptional reprogramming.
To identify the genes involved in the protective effect of UC￾MSCs on cisplatin-injured RPTECs in vitro, a genome-wide dif￾ferential gene expression analysis was performed. Consistency
among replicates was inspected visually, as shown in Supple￾mentary Fig. 4A. There was high homogeneity for each experi￾mental condition between the three replicates, with correlation
coefficients above 0.99 for all pairwise comparisons. The homo￾geneity was confirmed by principal component analysis (PCA) on
transformed read counts, where the three replicates clustered
together for each RPTEC experimental group (Control, Cispl, and
Cispl + UC-MSCs) (Fig. 2a). In addition, PCA showed that the
three groups were separated along the axis of major variation
(PC1, 72% of variance) indicating that the expression profiles
were different in the three groups. Indeed, a striking difference in
the gene expression profiles was found between the Control vs
Cispl and Cispl vs Cispl + UC-MSC groups (Fig. 2a). Notably, the
highest differential gene expression was observed in the Control
vs Cispl + UC-MSCs group.
Differentially expressed gene (DEG) analysis showed that 4776,
5041, and 6857 genes were differentially expressed (at adjusted
P < 0.05) in Cispl + UC-MSCs vs Cispl, Cispl vs Control,
and Cispl + UC-MSCs vs Control, respectively (Fig. 2b).
Top DEGs (|log2FC| > 2) for the Cispl + UC-MSCs vs Cispl
comparison are listed in Supplementary Data 1 and 2. Of the
enriched categories, chemotaxis together with proliferation,
regulation of cell morphogenesis/differentiation, and response
to hypoxia were the most strongly represented (Supplementary
Fig. 4B).
We focussed on the 409 genes that were exclusively modulated
by UC-MSC treatment in respect to cells treated with cisplatin
alone and were not shared among the three comparisons (Fig. 2b;
Supplementary Data 3), possibly representing a de novo
regenerative response induced by UC-MSCs. Notably, in the
enrichment analysis of these genes, the pathways related to
mitochondria and energy homeostasis were strongly represented
(Fig. 2c; Supplementary Fig. 5), including: lysine degradation
and NADP(H) generation (AAS, aminoadipate-semialdehyde
synthase), fatty acid metabolism (AASDH, aminoadipate-semi￾aldehyde dehydrogenase), mitochondrial cholesterol transport
(ACBD3, TSPO-associated acyl-coenzyme A binding domain
containing), and urea cycle (SLC25A 12/15, solute carrier family
25—Aspartate/Glutamate—Member 12 and 15). Additionally, in
cisplatin-injured RPTECs, UC-MSC treatment enhanced the gene
expression of electron transport chain components (COQ2,
coenzyme Q2 4-hydroxybenzoate polyprenyltransferase; COX
6B1 and 7B, cytochrome c oxidase 6B1 and 7B; SDH C and D,
succinate dehydrogenase complex subunit C and D), and proteins
involved in ATP production (ATP5SL, ATP synthase H+
transporting, mitochondrial Fo complex, subunit S like and
BZRAP1, translocator protein formerly known as the peripheral
benzodiazepine receptor). In addition, the energy sensor
adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK:
PRKAA1) was also upregulated by UC-MSC treatment as
indicated by the enrichment analysis (Fig. 2c; Supplementary
Data 3). Moreover, the AMPK downstream target nicotinamide
phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT)—the rate-limiting enzyme
in the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) salvage
pathway29—was upregulated 5.8-fold (log2FC: 2.550) in the top
DEGs between Cispl + UC-MSCs vs Cispl (Supplementary
Data 1). Additionally, kynureninase (KYNU)—involved in the
biosynthetic pathway of NAD+ from tryptophan catabolism30—
was 15-fold upregulated (log2FC: 3.91) in Cispl + UC-MSCs vs
Cispl (Supplementary Data 1).
UC-MSCs normalize cell energy and mitochondrial acetylome.
Given the high representation of DEGs involved in mitochondrial
energy metabolism and NAD+ biosynthesis, we evaluated the
effect in vitro of UC-MSCs on ATP and NAD+ content in injured
RPTECs. A decrease in total ATP was observed in cisplatin￾injured RPTECs, while ATP content was enhanced by UC-MSCs
in injured tubular cells (Fig. 3a). We also found a significant
decrease in total NAD+ cellular content in cisplatin-injured
RPTECs compared to resting cells (Fig. 3b), which was replen￾ished over control levels by UC-MSC treatment (Fig. 3b). Since
NAD+ is a cofactor of the main mitochondrial deacetylase
SIRT331, 32, we evaluated the mitochondrial protein acetylation at
the ɛ-amino group of lysine residues. Protein acetylation was
increased greatly in mitochondria isolated from cisplatin-injured
RPTECs, unlike in resting cells (Fig. 3c). Treatment with
UC-MSCs decreased the protein-acetylated residues (Fig. 3c),
indicating their ability to restore SIRT3 activity. SIRT3 messenger
RNA (mRNA) and protein expression were consistently reduced
(by 40% and 30%, respectively) in injured RPTECs compared to
control cells and it recovered after treatment with UC-MSCs
(Supplementary Fig. 6A; Fig. 3d).

Since SIRT3 regulates mitochondrial antioxidant activity23, we
evaluated the expression of superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2). As
shown in Supplementary Data 1, a 6.6-fold increase (log2FC: 2.73)
in SOD2 mRNA expression was found in the top DEGs by
RPTECs exposed to Cispl + UC-MSCs compared to Cispl. The
protein expression of SOD2 was reduced by cisplatin and was
enhanced by UC-MSC treatment, even over control, as high￾lighted by a very high signal of SOD2-positive mitochondria in
cell cytoplasm and projections (Fig. 3e). In parallel, cisplatin
induced ROS increase in RPTECs, assessed by the O2•− sensor
MitoSOX, compared to untreated cells (Fig. 3f). Co-culture with
UC-MSCs exerted a strong antioxidant effect (Fig. 3f).

Horizontal trafficking of functional mitochondria among cells has
recently emerged as a new physiological and rescuing process in a
plethora of different stress conditions33–40. We therefore explored
whether UC-MSCs could induce mitochondrial transfer among
injured RPTECs through cytoplasmic protrusions. First, we
observed that the development of tubular cell cytoplasmic pro￾jections normally occurred in control cells (Fig. 4a) and strongly
declined after cisplatin exposure (Fig. 4a). Co-culture with UC￾MSCs markedly enhanced cell–cell connections among cisplatin￾injured RPTECs (Fig. 4a). Then, to demonstrate the intercellular
mitochondria transport among RPTECs, we used two fusion
constructs of the E1 alpha pyruvate dehydrogenase leader
sequence with GFP or RFP, which efficiently labeled tubular cell
mitochondria in green and red, respectively. Two distinct popu￾lations of RPTECs were obtained by separately transfecting cells
with GFP- or RFP-tagged mitochondria. Cells were then mixed
and seeded in equal proportions. The physiological exchange of
mitochondria occurred among RPTECs, to the extent that 18% of
resting cells showed both red and green (yellow) mitochondria
(Fig. 4b). Exposure to cisplatin reduced the organelle transfer to
only 4.1% of the cells, which was instead restored to 25% by co￾culture with UC-MSCs, as evidenced by the presence of yellow
mitochondria within RPTEC cellular projections (Fig. 4b). Incu￾bation of injured RPTECs with a non-toxic concentration of taxol
(see Methods section), a suppressor of microtubule dynamics,
prevented the formation of cytoplasmic protrusions (Supple￾mentary Fig. 6B) and the mitochondrial trafficking (Fig. 4b)
induced by UC-MSCs, suggesting that tubulin is directly involved
in both processes.
This evidence was supported by data of co-staining of tubulin
and SOD2-labeled mitochondria that disclosed a physiologically
microtubule interconnection with mitochondria among resting
RPTECs (Fig. 4c). Following cisplatin treatment, tubulin
cytoskeleton architecture disarranged and mitochondria distrib￾uted in clusters in the perinuclear region (Fig. 4c). Co-culture
with UC-MSCs normalized the microtubule network and restored
mitochondrial distribution within cell–cell projections (Fig. 4c).
UC-MSCs regulate mitochondrial trafficking via Kif5c. We
next investigated the mechanism underlying the effect of human
UC-MSCs in favouring the formation of intercellular processes—
a condition indispensable for mitochondrial trafficking—by
assessing whether human UC-MSCs were able to regulate post￾translational modifications of microtubules in cultured RPTECs.
As shown in Fig. 5a, cisplatin induced a shift toward the acety￾lated form of tubulin compared to control cells. Treatment with
UC-MSCs restored the deacetylation levels of tubulin in cisplatin￾injured RPTECs (Fig. 5a) possibly by regulating SIRT3 activity.
It is known that the motor protein Kif5c, a kinesin heavy chain
subunit, is involved in the anterograde transport of mitochondria
along the microtubule network41, 42. Tubular cells constitutively
express Kif5c, which decreased in response to cisplatin (Fig. 5b).
UC-MSC treatment enhanced tubular expression of Kif5c
(Fig. 5b). Consistently, immunofluorescence analysis showed that
Kif5c appeared as punctuate cytoplasmic staining in RPTECs
under physiological conditions (Supplementary Fig. 6C). When
RPTECs were exposed to cisplatin, a marked reduction in Kif5c
was observed, which was increased by UC-MSC co-incubation
(Supplementary Fig. 6C). That Kif5c actually interacts with
mitochondria was shown in resting RPTECs by co-staining with
SOD2-labeled mitochondria (Fig. 5c). At variance, cisplatin
induced a strong perinuclear localization of mitochondria and
Kif5c (Fig. 5c). A close connection between Kif5c and
mitochondria was found along the tubulin-rich projections in
injured RPTECs in response to UC-MSCs (Fig. 5c).
The finding that F-actin did not co-stain with mitochondria
(Supplementary Fig. 6D), ruled out the possibility that F-actin
plays a role in mitochondrial transport.
SIRT3 preserves mitochondria and their exchange among cells.
Having established a strong correlation between the renoprotec￾tive effect of UC-MSCs and restoration of SIRT3 expression and
activity, we investigated in vitro whether SIRT3 could be a MSC
target actually not dispensable in preserving mitochondrial
integrity and favouring tubular cell repair. For this purpose,
SIRT3 was silenced in cultured RPTECs by specific small inter￾fering RNA (siRNA) to obtain a remarkable reduction in SIRT3
mRNA expression as compared to cell transfected with siNULL
(siSIRT3: 0.4 ± 0.04 vs siNULL: 1.1 ± 0.01, P < 0.01 with unpaired
t-test, n = 3 independent experiments). Notably, UC-MSCs co￾cultured with RPTECs silenced for SIRT3 failed to normalize
cisplatin-induced mitochondrial fragmentation (Fig. 6a) and
depolarization (Fig. 6b). Concomitantly, UC-MSCs were unable
to recover mitochondrial mass (Fig. 6c) and ATP levels (Fig. 6d)
in damaged RPTECs lacking SIRT3. Moreover, the ability of
UC-MSCs to enhance SOD2 expression (Fig. 6e) and mito￾chondrial shuttling among injured tubular cells through tubulin￾rich protrusions (Fig. 6f) was abolished by SIRT3 silencing in
cisplatin-injured RPTECs.
A further proof of the functional role of SIRT3 in tubular
cell repair was documented in SIRT3 overexpressing RPTECs,
a condition that mimics UC-MSC effect. Upregulation of SIRT3
mRNA in cultured RPTECs was obtained by lipofectamine￾mediated transfection with pCMV-hSIRT3-GFP (pSIRT3) as
compared to cells transfected with pCMV6-AC-GFP (pNULL)
(pSIRT3: 2.3 ± 0.13 vs pNULL: 1.0 ± 0.03, P < 0.001 with
unpaired t-test, n = 3 independent experiments). SIRT3

overexpression protected RPTECs from cisplatin-induced
mitochondrial fragmentation and depolarization, as previously
documented by our group20. Likewise, here we found that
cisplatin did not reduce mitochondrial mass (Fig. 6g) and ATP
production (Fig. 6h) in RPTECs in face of high SIRT3 expression
as compared to cells transfected with pNULL. We also found that
SOD2 expression was not affected by cisplatin exposure in
tubular cells overexpressing SIRT3 as compared to cells
transfected with pNULL (Fig. 6i). In line with previous findings
showing that microtubule distribution and function are under the
control of NAD+ and SIRT3 deacetylase activity43, here we found
that the formation of cytoplasmic protrusions rich in mitochon￾dria was preserved in injured RPTECs expressing high levels
of SIRT3 (Fig. 6j). Collectively, all these data clearly indicate
SIRT3 as a crucial player in the process of tubular repair induced
by UC-MSCs.
UC-MSCs drive tubular repair regulating SIRT3 targets in AKI.
The biological relevance of our in vitro findings was validated in
mice with cisplatin-induced AKI. First, we found that ATP levels
were markedly lower in kidney extracts of cisplatin-injected mice
compared to control animals, and were enhanced following
UC-MSC treatment (Fig. 7a). Concomitantly, the mRNA
expression of ATP synthase, the oxidative phosphorylation
complex V responsible for the ATP production, was recovered by
UC-MSCs in renal tissues of cisplatin mice (Supplementary
Fig. 7A). We also found a reduction in NAD+ content in renal
tissues harvested from mice with cisplatin-induced AKI, which
was restored in mice treated with UC-MSCs (Fig. 7b). NAD+
replenishment was accompanied by a normalization of the acet￾ylome profile of mitochondrial proteins isolated from the renal
tissue of cisplatin mice infused with UC-MSCs compared to mice
given saline (Fig. 7c; Supplementary Fig. 7B), thus reflecting a

boost in SIRT3 deacetylase activity. In the renal tissues of cis￾platin mice, SIRT3 transcript level (Supplementary Fig. 7C) and
protein (Supplementary Fig. 7D) decreased compared to control
animals, and was markedly restored by UC-MSCs treatment. A
similar trend was observed for the expression of the upstream
regulator of SIRT3, the transcription factor PGC1α, that mark￾edly decreased in renal tissue of cisplatin mice and was upregu￾lated by UC-MSC treatment (Supplementary Fig. 7E). In parallel,
SOD2 protein expression recovered in response to UC-MSC
treatment (Fig. 7d, e; Supplementary Fig. 7F, G).

(Fig. 7e; Supplementary Fig. 7G) concomitantly with the
restoration of tubulin protein expression (Fig. 7f) and its
acetylated status (Fig. 7g). Moreover, the expression of the motor
protein Kif5c, which markedly decreased in response to cisplatin,
was restored to normal levels following UC-MSC treatment
(Fig. 7h).
As proof-of-concept that SIRT3 has a role in the regulation of
microtubule architecture, we took advantage of untreated SIRT3-
deficient mice that, compared to their untreated wild-type (WT)
littermates, showed a constitutive hyper-acetylation state of
mitochondrial proteins (Supplementary Fig. 8A), an altered
distribution and reduced expression of SOD2 and tubulin (Fig. 7i;
Supplementary Fig. 8B), similar to that observed in mice with
cisplatin-induced AKI showed in Fig. 7e. Scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) of renal tissue from untreated WT mice
revealed the presence of several thin cytoplasmic protrusions,
with nanotube-like morphology, which arose from the apical part
of the tubular cells and crossed the lumen connecting different
epithelial cells from the same proximal tubule (Fig. 7j). At
variance, untreated mice deficient in SIRT3 did not show any
signs of cell protrusion in the lumen of proximal tubuli (Fig. 7j).
In these animals lacking SIRT3, cisplatin injection induced a
more severe renal dysfunction and tubular injury (Supplementary
Fig. 8C, D) as compared with those observed in WT littermates
with AKI (Supplementary Fig. 8E, F). Notably, lack of any
protective effect on renal BUN levels, tubular damage (Supple￾mentary Fig. 8C, D) and nanotube formation (Fig. 7j) was
observed when cisplatin SIRT3−/− mice were infused with
UC-MSCs. At variance, in the WT littermates with AKI, infusion
of UC-MSCs or their corresponding conditioned medium (CM)
(Supplementary Fig. 8E, F) markedly protected from renal
functional and structural impairment. In parallel, nanotube-like
structures, which were affected by cisplatin injection in WT mice,
were restored by UC-MSCs (Fig. 7j). Altogether these data clearly
demonstrate a key role of SIRT3 in the process of renal repair
in AKI.
Discussion
In this study, we provide direct experimental evidence that
human UC-MSC therapy facilitates tubular cell recovery, thus
preserving mitochondrial functional integrity and mobility as well
as restoring the microtubule network, which are pivotal deter￾minants of bioenergetic crosstalk among injured cells. Here, we
found that after systemic infusion in mice with AKI, UC-MSCs
localized in the damaged kidney almost exclusively in peritubular
areas and strongly limited cisplatin-induced tubular cell mito￾chondrial fragmentation, thus tipping mitochondrial dynamics
toward fusion as opposed to fission. Tubular cell recovery was
specifically induced by human UC-MSCs and by their CM
through a paracrine action on resident renal cells, at variance of
human fibroblasts, here used as control cells, which failed to
improve mitochondrial damage and renal injury in cisplatin mice.
These findings were corroborated by in vitro studies, which
established a strong causal link between the protective paracrine
effect of UC-MSCs and the preservation of mitochondrial
functional, and structural integrity in cisplatin-injured cultured
tubular cells.
To gain a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying
the beneficial effect of MSC therapy, we first performed a gen￾ome-wide differential gene expression analysis of cultured tubular
cells. Notably, we found a remarkable difference in gene expres￾sion profile between resting and injured tubular cells, especially
when exposed to UC-MSCs, suggesting that cell-based therapy
primes the transcriptional induction of several genes in tubular
cells that are possibly involved in the processes of renal repair.
Notably, enrichment analysis revealed a stark difference between
resting cells and injured RPTECs exposed to UC-MSCs, in terms
of a high recurrence of genes involved in mitochondrial energy
production, including aminoacid catabolism, urea cycle, fatty acid
metabolism, and electron transport chain components. We also
found that AMPK—a metabolic sensor that maintains energy
homeostasis—was upregulated by UC-MSCs, in line with a pre￾vious finding of ours showing that AMPK activation by AICAR
exerted a renoprotective effect20. Concurrently, Nampt—an
AMPK downstream target44—and kynureninase were strongly
upregulated by UC-MSCs, both regulators of their biosynthetic
product NAD+, which we found actually increased at the tubular
cell intracellular level in response to MSCs compared to cisplatin￾injured cells. Collectively, all these data strongly indicated that
UC-MSCs were able to induce global metabolic reprogramming
of damaged tubular cells to sustain energy supply. Consistently,
it has recently been demonstrated that NAD+ plays a role in
rewiring tubular cell metabolism to sustain renal recovery in
different experimental models of AKI45. NAD+ is the essential
cofactor of several enzymes, including the deacetylase activity of
SIRT346, which controls the mitochondrial adaptive stress
response47, 48 and energy production21. The biological relevance
of SIRT3 as an essential player in tubular cell repair in experi￾mental AKI was supported by the finding that renal SIRT3

reduction was functionally linked to a striking impairment of
mitochondrial dynamics20. The above evidence offered the
rationale for looking at SIRT3 as a possible key driver of UC-MSC
regenerative activity in tubular cells during AKI. Notably, we
found that UC-MSCs preserved both SIRT3 deacetylase activity
and expression, enhancing tubular ATP and SOD2 levels, thereby
preventing the energy deficit and sustaining the antioxidant
activity. The mechanism by which MSC modulate mitochondrial
SIRT3 expression could be explained by the ability of UC-MSCs
to regulate the intracellular level of Nampt and PGC1α, which are
known to induce SIRT3 gene transcription25. The evidence of a

provided by transfection experiments in which SIRT3 over￾expression in RPTECs prevented the mitochondrial dysfunction
triggered by cisplatin, while the lack of SIRT3 in injured tubular
cells was enough to abolish the protective effect of UC-MSCs on
mitochondrial functional integrity. The translational relevance of
these in vitro findings rests on data that SIRT3-deficient mice
exhibited a more severe AKI compared to their WT littermates,
and did not respond to UC-MSC treatment, thus underlying the
essential contribution of SIRT3, a key target of cell therapy, in the
process of tubular repair. We can not definitely rule out the
theoretical possibility that substance(s) secreted by UC-MSCs
may protect from cisplatin-induced injury by lowering some
critical contributors to cell death independently of SIRT3.
This however is inconsistent with evidence provided here
that UC-MSCs failed to protect both SIRT3−/− mice and SIRT3-
deficient RPTECs from cisplatin-induced injury.
Intercellular mitochondrial transfer from donor cells to injured
tissues has recently been described as a new rescue mechanism
that counteracts a plethora of different stress conditions33–40.
Here, the relevance of mitochondrial cell–cell trafficking has been
highlighted by findings showing that RPTEC constitutively
exhibited a complex interconnected microtubule network
exchanging a large number of mitochondria via the motor protein
Kif5c. This mechanism was markedly affected in cisplatin-injured
tubular cells. Treatment with UC-MSCs strongly enhanced
mitochondrial intercellular transport along the tubulin-rich
protrusions, a phenomenon that was halted by taxol, indicating
that microtubules are active players in organelle mobility.
These long-distance cell–cell connections, recently defined as
membrane nanotubes49, are sites of mitochondrial transfer, a
process that bridges energy exchange to complement cellular
metabolism37, 50–53. These data advance our understanding of the
complex pro-regenerative paracrine effects of UC-MSCs and
disclose that, at least in the kidney, UC-MSCs may not act
directly like mitochondrial donors, as previously stated34–36, 54, 55
and here documented by the lack of human mitochondria (hMT)
within mouse tubular cells in proximity of engrafted MSCs.
Instead, UC-MSC therapy regulates and protects the molecular
machinery that drives the intercellular transfer of healthy mito￾chondria among tubular cells during injury, favouring bioener￾getic crosstalk.
Having established that UC-MSCs play an important role in
both mitochondrial motility and SIRT3 expression and activity,
we further investigated whether SIRT3 could be the driving force
in microtubule-dependent mitochondrial transfer. A recent study
pointed to SIRT3 being a regulator of microtubule dynamics in
terms of tubulin polymerization and depolimerization43.
Furthermore, the deacetylation state of tubulin has been described
as affecting microtubule intracellular dislocation56, 57 and func￾tion in dynamic cellular projections58. Our data showed that
treatment with UC-MSCs normalized the distribution and acet￾ylation of tubulin in injured tubular cells and in mice with AKI.
That SIRT3 plays a functional role in regulating mitochondrial
spatial distribution along intercellular tubulin-rich projections
was further supported by the evidence that SIRT3 overexpression
in tubular cells prevented the cisplatin-induced reduction of
cytoplasmic protrusions carrying mitochondria, while SIRT3
silencing strongly halted the ability of UC-MSCs to induce
mitochondrial trafficking among RPTECs. The ability of SIRT3 to
regulate mitochondrial motility can be attributed to its capacity to
control ROS generation23 and AMPK activation59, which have
been shown to regulate tubulin acetylation60–62 and cellular
mitochondrial flux63, respectively. Finally, taking advantage of
genetically modified mice, we demonstrated that SIRT3 deficiency
caused a strong reduction in tubulin expression in proximal
tubular cells, a condition observed in WT mice with AKI that
exhibit SIRT3 downregulation. The observed microtubule dis￾assembly in SIRT3−/− mice translated into a complete lack of
nanotube-like structures among tubular cells, clearly indicating
that SIRT3 modulated the microtubule network.
In conclusion, we uncovered that human UC-MSCs carry out a
multimodal paracrine action in which complex intra- and inter￾cellular pathways promote reparative mechanisms in experi￾mental AKI by preserving mitochondrial homeostasis and
microtubule-dependent organelle trafficking through the
enhancement of SIRT3 activity. These data highlight the potential
that therapies with MSCs or their bio-products have as future
translational approaches in humans. In addition to the clinical
implications for AKI, these data provide new clues regarding how
the endosymbiotic origins of mitochondria could be exploited by
cell-based therapy to promote intercellular trafficking, driving the
high-energy process of repair in organs other than the kidney.
Methods
In vivo experimental design. Two-month-old immunodeficient NOD/SCID
female mice (Charles River Italia S.p.a., Calco, Italy) were randomly allocated to the
experimental groups. Animals were housed in a constant room temperature
(22–24 °C) with a 12-hour dark and 12-hour light cycle and fed a standard diet.
AKI was induced in NOD/SCID mice by subcutaneous injection of the nephrotoxic
drug cis-diaminedichloroplatinum (cisplatin; Ebewe Italia Srl, Rome, Italy) at the
dose of 16.0 mg/kg. To investigate the effect of human UC-derived MSC (UC￾MSC) treatment in AKI, mice were divided into two groups and intravenously (i.v.)
injected 24 h after cisplatin as follows: group 1, saline (n = 6); group 2, UC-MSCs
at sixth passage (5 × 105 cells per mouse; n = 6). Normal mice served as controls
(n = 6). Mice were killed at 4 days after cisplatin and kidney samples were collected.
Renal function was assessed as BUN using the Reflotron test (Roche Diagnostics,

Milan, Italy) following manufacturer’s instructions. The effect of i.v. infusion of
human fibroblasts at sixth passage (5 × 105 cells per mouse; n = 4), the same
passage of UC-MSCs, has been assessed in NOD/SCID mice 24 h after cisplatin
injection, in comparison to saline mice (n = 4), and killed at 4 days to assess renal
function, histology, and mitochondrial morphology.
In selected experiments, 2-month-old SIRT3−/− female mice, generated in a
mixed genetic background (provided by Professor Frederick Alt, Harvard Medical
School, Boston, MA, USA)32, and their C57BL6x129 WT littermates were
randomly allocated to the experimental groups as follows: group 1, SIRT3−/− mice
received saline (n = 4); group 2, SIRT3−/− mice received cisplatin and saline (n = 6);
group 3, SIRT3−/− received cisplatin and, after 24 h, UC-MSCs (5 × 105 cells per
mouse, n = 6); group 4, C57BL6x129 mice received saline (n = 5); group 5,
C57BL6x129 mice received cisplatin and saline (n = 5); group 6, C57BL6x129 mice
received cisplatin and, 24 h later, UC-MSCs (5 × 105 cells per mouse, n = 6); group
7, C57BL6x129 mice received cisplatin and, 24 h later, CM derived UC-MSCs (CM
derived from 5 × 105 UC-MSCs/mouse, n = 5). All these animals were killed at
4 days to assess renal function, histology, and SEM analysis.
Renal histology. Kidney samples were fixed in Duboscq-Brazil, and paraffin sec￾tions were stained with periodic acid—Schiff’s reagent (PAS). Luminal hyaline casts
and tubular necrosis (denudation of the tubular basement membrane) were
assessed in non-overlapping fields (up to 28 for each section) using a ×40 objective
(high-power field, HPF; Primo Star, Zeiss, Jena, Germany). The number of casts
and tubular profiles showing necrosis was analyzed twice in a single-blind fashion.
Morphometric analysis of mitochondria in tubular cells. Glutaraldehyde-fixed
fragments of cortical kidney tissue were washed repeatedly in cacodylate buffer,
postfixed in 1% OsO4, dehydrated through ascending grades of alcohol, and
embedded in Epon resin. Ultrathin sections were stained with UAR-uranyl acetate
replacement stain for examination using a Philips Morgagni transmission electron
microscope (TEM; Philips). Numerical density of mitochondria (NV, n/µm3) was
estimated using morphometric analysis according to Weibel64, using an orthogonal
grid digitally superimposed to digitized electron microscope pictures of proximal
tubules at ×7100. Briefly, the mitochondrial profile area density (NA) was estimated
using the ratio between the number of mitochondria and the proximal tubular area
in the image calculated on the basis of grid points. Mitochondrial volume density
(VV) was determined using the ratio of grid points falling over mitochondria,
divided by the total number of points of the grid container in the proximal tubule
section. NV was then estimated for each animal using the formula64:
NV ¼ ð Þ 1=β N3=2
A =V1=2
V
 
Where β is the shape coefficient for ellipsoidal mitochondria, calculated as the ratio
of the harmonic mean of major and minor axis of mitochondrial sections measured
on digital images. The mean mitochondrial volume was calculated for each animal
as the ratio of mitochondrial volume density VV to numerical density NV.
Scanning electron microscopy. Kidneys of SIRT3−/− mice and their WT litter￾mates perfused with glutaraldehyde 1.25% were analyzed for SEM. Renal specimens
were fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde, washed in cacodylate buffer and postfixed in 1%
osmium tetroxide. Samples were then dehydrated in graded ethanol, critical point￾dried in carbon dioxide and coated with atomic gold particles prior to viewing with
a SEM (Supra 55, Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany)65.
Immunofluorescence analysis in renal tissue. For SOD2 staining in renal tissue,
3 µm optimal cutting temperature (OCT)-fixed cryosections were air-dried. After
blocking non-specific sites with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA, Sigma-Aldrich,
Milan, Italy) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), slides were incubated with rabbit
anti- SOD2 (1:200; #AB10346; Merck Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany) antibody,
followed by donkey anti-rabbit Cy3-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:80; Jackson
Immunoresearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA, USA). For tubulin or
SIRT3 staining in renal tissue, 3 µm periodate-lysine paraformaldehyde (PLP)-fixed
cryosections were air-dried and washed with PBS. Then samples were incubated
with 3% BSA, 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) in PBS to block non-specific sites for 30
min, followed by a mouse anti-tubulin (1:100; #T9026 clone DM1A; Sigma￾Aldrich) or a rabbit anti-SIRT3 antibody (1:50, #sc-49744 clone P-19; Santa Cruz)
overnight at 4 °C, followed by a donkey anti-mouse or anti-rabbit FITC-conjugated
(1:80; Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories) antibody, as appropriate. Nuclei
were stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, Sigma-Aldrich) and the
renal structure was labeled with FITC-conjugated wheat germ agglutinin (WGA)
lectin (1:500; #FL-1021S; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA), rhodamine￾labeled WGA lectin (1:500; #RL-1022; Vector Laboratories), or Alexa Fluor 633-
conjugated WGA (1:100; #W21404; Thermo Fisher, Life Technologies; Waltham,
MA, USA), as appropriate. Samples were examined by confocal inverted laser
microscopy (LSM 510 Meta, Zeiss) and the quantification of SOD2 was performed
in 10 random fields per sample and expressed as the % of SOD2-positive tubuli and
normalized for the total number of tubuli.
Quantification of UC-MSCs engraftment. To study the engraftment of human
UC-MSCs in mouse renal tissues, HNA was used. Briefly, 8 μm thick sections from
OCT-included kidney specimens were fixed 10 min in cold acetone at 4 °C. Then,
sections were incubated with 1% BSA blocking solution in PBS and then incubated
with anti-human Nuclei-Fluor 488-conjugated antibody (1:50; #MAB1281A4 clone
235-1; Merck Millipore) at 4 °C overnight. In addition, a mouse anti-human
mitochondria (hMT) Cy3-conjugated antibody (1:50; #MAB1273C3 clone 113-1;
Merck Millipore) was used. Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI and the renal
structure was marked with Alexa Fluor 633-Conjugated WGA (1:100; #W21404;
Thermo Fisher, Life Technologies) for 10 min Cover slips were mounted using
fluorescent mounting medium (Dako, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA,
USA). Twelve sections for each animal (n = 5) were analyzed at confocal micro￾scope (Zeiss, Original magnification ×630), and HNA-positive cells were counted.
Data were expressed as the number of HNA-positive cells per 1 × 105 renal cells.
Real-time PCR. Renal tissue was harvested in TRIzol reagent (Thermo Fisher, Life
Technologies) and total RNA was extracted according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Contaminating genomic DNA was removed by RNase-free DNase
(Promega, Madison, WI, USA) for 1 h at 37 °C. The first-strand complimentary
DNA (cDNA) (2 µg) was produced using the SuperScript II cDNA Synthesis Kit
(Thermo Fisher, Life Technologies) following the manufacturer’s procedure. No
enzyme was added for reverse transcriptase-negative controls (RT−).
To amplify cDNA of mouse Atp5b, Pgc1α, and Sirt3, we used TaqMan
Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) and inventoried TaqMan assays
of the Atp5b (FAM/MBG probe Mm00443967g1), the Pgc1α gene (FAM/MBG
probe Mm00447181m1), the Sirt3 gene (FAM/MBG probe Mm01275638m1), and
a mouse α-actin endogenous control (VIC/MGB probe), according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. PCR was performed on the Viia7 Real-Time PCR
System (Applied Biosystems). The amplification profile consisted of 2 min at 50 °C
and 10 min at 95 °C; the samples were cycled 40 times at 95 °C for 15 s. and 60 °C
for 60 s. Data were analyzed using the 2−ΔΔCT method and presented as fold
changes relative to mouse wild type (Control).
To amplify cDNA of human SIRT3 and GAPDH, inventoried TaqMan assays
(FAM/MBG probe Hs_00202030m1 and 4333764F, respectively) were used
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Cell cultures and incubations. Human UC-derived MSCs (UC-MSCs) were col￾lected from pregnant women after cesarean sections and informed written consent
was obtained. Samples were maintained at 4 °C and then processed in accordance
with a good manufacturing practice (GMP)-compliant protocol for the isolation
and expansion of UC-MSCs66. Briefly, after rinsing the vein by blunt end needle
syringe, the UC was cut in 5 cm long segments and subsequently cut longitudinally
to expose the inner surface and subsequently transferred to a 150 mm Petri dish
(Corning, New York, NY, USA) containing alpha MEM (Thermo Fisher, Invi￾trogen) enriched with 5% human platelet lysate (hPL) from healthy donors67 and
gentamicin and kept at 37 °C in 5% CO2. After 1 week, UC remaining tissue was
removed and adherent cells expanded for an additional week, changing 40%
medium every 3–4 days. At sub confluency, cells were detached by TrypLe
(Thermo Fisher) treatment and reseeded for two consecutive expansion steps at
100–300 cells/cm2, until confluency, in CellSTACK (Corning) chambers66.
Immunophenotypic analysis revealed that UC-MSCs showed a strong
expression of the main MSC markers CD73, CD90, and CD105, as well as of CD44
and CD166. Additionally, UC-MSCs possessed a high proliferative capacity, as
evidenced by colony forming unit (CFU-F) assays66. When tested for
differentiation capabilities, UC-MSCs were able to differentiate into adipogenic,
chondrogenic, and osteogenic lineages, thus indicating that UC-MSCs are
multipotent stromal cells66.
For the experiments, human UC-MSCs were grown in culture medium,
consisting of alpha MEM (Invitrogen) enriched with 5% hPL and 50 mg/ml
gentamicin in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. At 80% confluence,
cells were detached and seeded (10,000 cells/cm2) up to a maximum eighth passage.
As control cells, adult normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDF-Ad) were
purchased from Lonza (#CC-2511) and grown in fibroblast basal medium (FBM;
Lonza, Milan, Italy) supplemented with FGM-2 single quotes (Lonza). NHDF-Ad
are guaranteed to test negative for mycoplasma, bacteria, yeast, and fungi. NHDF￾Ad are characterized by morphological observation throughout serial passages.
A certificate of analysis is provided by Lonza for each cell lot.
Human RPTECs were purchased from Lonza (#CC-2553) and grown in renal
epithelial cell basal medium (REBM; Lonza) supplemented with REGM
SingleQuots (Lonza) in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. At 80%
confluence, RPTECs were detached by trypsinization and reseeded (5000 cells/cm2)
up to a maximum 10th passage. RPTECs are guaranteed to test negative for
mycoplasma, bacteria, yeast, and fungi. RPTEC are characterized by positivity for
gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (γ-GTP) and alkaline phosphatase, and by their
ability to form tubules on Matrigel. A certificate of analysis is provided by Lonza
for each cell lot.
For all experiments, RPTECs were seeded 30,000 cells/cm2 and exposed to
cisplatin 5 μM for 6 h (in REBM basal medium, Lonza) and, after cisplatin removal,
RPTECs were maintained for 24 h in the presence or absence of human UC-MSCs
seeded 1:1 (30,000 cells/cm2) in the inserts of 24 mm transwell with 0.4 μm pore

(Corning) in REBM basal medium (Lonza). In selected experiments, NHDF-Ad,
used as control cells were seeded 1:1 (30,000 cells/cm2) in the inserts of 24 mm
Transwell with 0.4 μm pore (Corning) in REBM basal medium (Lonza) at the same
passages as UC-MSCs.
In additional experiments, RPTECs were treated with a non-toxic
concentration68 of taxol 1 nM (Indena S.p.a, Milan, Italy). In our setting, the
concentration of taxol used did not affect the number of living RPTECs exposed or
not to cisplatin (Control: 54,412 ± 2582; Control + taxol: 55,931 ± 1180; Cisplatin:
38,235 ± 1274; Cisplatin + taxol: 37,255 ± 2137 cells/cm2; n = 3 independent
experiments).
To prepare CM, UC-MSCs were incubated overnight in αMEM (Invitrogen) in
serum free condition (15 ml per flask). The day after, medium was collected and
centrifuged at 2000×g for 20 min at 4 °C to remove cellular debris. After
centrifugation, supernatant was transferred into Amicon Ultra-15 centrifugal Filter
Devices cut off 3 K (Merck Millipore) and centrifuged at 4000×g for 20 min to
concentrate the volume of CM. Each aliquot of CM, obtained from 5 × 105
UC-MSCs, was transferred into 1.5 ml tubes and frozen at −80 °C until use.
Genome-wide differential gene expression analysis. Three biological replicates
were performed for each group (Control, Cispl, and Cispl + UC-MSCs). Total RNA
was extracted using the PureLink RNA Micro Scale Kit (Invitrogen), according to
the protocol provided by the manufacturer. cDNA Libraries were prepared using
the Ion AmpliSeq Transcriptome Human Gene Expression Kit (Thermo Fisher).
Briefly, cDNA was first generated with SuperScript VILO cDNA Synthesis Kit from
10 ng of total RNA. Then, cDNA was amplified using Ion AmpliSeq technology to
accurately maintain expression levels of all targeted genes. After target amplifica￾tion, the resulting amplicons were ligated to barcode adapters. Libraries were then
quantified by qPCR using the Ion Library Quantitation Kit (Thermo Fisher), and
pooled in equimolar amounts. Template preparation (emulsion PCR) and
sequencing on the Ion Proton Sequencer were performed at the CRIBI Bio￾technology Center (Università degli Studi di Padova). Gene expression levels were
provided as raw read counts. As the Ion AmpliSeq Transcriptome Human Gene
Expression Kit covers each target gene with a single amplicon, normalization for
transcript length bias is unnecessary. DEG analysis was performed on raw read
counts using DESeq2 after discarding targets with <10 reads69. In addition, the
RMRP gene target was discarded because it was highly expressed, accounting for
~3% of reads in all samples (Supplementary Fig. 3). DEGs, selected by their
adjusted P-value and/or log2 fold change, were submitted to enrichment analysis
using Enrichr70, focusing on gene ontology terms. Read counts were normalized by
the regularized logarithm (rlog) method implemented in DESeq2 before PCA and
to draw heat maps.
Mitochondrial morphology and membrane potential detection. To evaluate
mitochondrial morphology, living RPTECs were incubated with 250 nM fluor￾escent probe MitoTracker Red (#M7512; Thermo Fisher, Invitrogen) for 30 min, at
37 °C, 5% CO2. Nuclei were counterstained with NucBlue Live ReadyProbes
(Hoechst; #R37605; Thermo Fisher, Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. At the end of probes incubations, living cells were examined by confocal
inverted laser microscopy (LSM 510 Meta, Zeiss) and mitochondrial fragmentation
was expressed as the % of Hoechst positive cells with fragmented mitochondria
compared to elongate one identified by MitoTracker Red staining in 10 random
fields per sample.
Mitochondria membrane potential was evaluated by exposing RPTECs to 5 μM
JC-1 (#T3168; Thermo Fisher, Invitrogen) for 30 min, at 37 °C, 5% CO2. JC-1
exhibits potential-dependent accumulation in mitochondria indicated by a
fluorescence shift from green (cytoplasm) to red (mitochondria). At the end of
probe incubations, living cells were examined by confocal inverted laser
microscopy (LSM 510 Meta, Zeiss) and the quantification of JC-1 red and green
areas (Pixel2; Image J 1.40g software) was performed in 10 random fields per
sample and mitochondria polarization was expressed as the ratio between red and
green fluorescent area.
MitoSOX assay in cultured cells. Mitochondrial ROS were measured using
MitoSOX Red, a live-cell permeant mitochondrial superoxide (O2•−) indicator
(#M36008; Thermo Fisher, Invitrogen). RPTECs were incubated with 5 μM
MitoSOX for 30 min, at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Cells were collected by trypsinization,
washed, and mitochondrial O2•− was determined by FACS (FACS Canto, BD
Biosciences, Milan, Italy). MitoSOX was excited by laser at 510 nm and data col￾lected at FSC, SSC, 580 nm (FL2) channel. Data were expressed as MitoSOX mean
fluorescence intensity (MFI) and % of MitoSOX fluorescent cells.
Immunofluorescence analysis in cultured cells. At the end of incubations,
RPTECs were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde (PFA, Electron Microscopy Science,
Hatfield, PA, USA) and 4% sucrose (Sigma-Aldrich) followed by permeabilization
with 0.3% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich). Non-specific binding sites were blocked
with 2% FCS, 2% BSA, and 0.2% bovine gelatine in PBS. Cells were incubated with
a mouse anti-tubulin antibody (1:300; #T9026 clone DM1A; Sigma-Aldrich), a
rabbit anti-SOD2 antibody (1:500; #AB10346; Merck Millipore), a rabbit anti￾cleaved caspase-3 (Asp175) antibody (1:200; #9661; Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA,
USA), a rabbit anti-phospho-histone H3 (Ser10) antibody (1:75; #9701; Cell
Signaling), a rabbit anti-Kif5c antibody (1:50; #SAB1306219; Sigma-Aldrich),
followed by incubation with a goat anti-rabbit Cy3-conjugated (1:80; Jackson
ImmunoResearch Laboratories), or goat anti-mouse FITC-conjugated (1:80; Jack￾son ImmunoResearch Laboratories) secondary antibody, as appropriate. To study
F-actin, fixed and permeabilized cells were incubated with rhodamine-phalloidin
(20 U/ml; #R415; Thermo Fisher, Invitrogen). Nuclei were counterstained with
DAPI (Sigma-Aldrich). Negative controls were obtained by omitting primary
antibodies. After mounting with Dako (Agilent Technologies), cover slips were
examined using a confocal inverted laser microscope (LSM 510 Meta, Zeiss).
The quantification of the area corresponding to SOD2, cleaved caspase-3, and
Kif5c staining was performed in 10 random fields per sample, expressed as MFI
(Image J 1.40g software) and normalized for the number of DAPI positive cell
nuclei (MFI/cell).
Transfection experiments in cultured cells. To label mitochondria, RPTECs
were transfected with a fusion construct of the leader sequence of E1 alpha pyr￾uvate dehydrogenase fused with red (CellLight Mitochondria-RFP, BacMam 2.0;
#C10601; Thermo Fisher, Invitrogen) or green fluorescent protein (CellLight
Mitochondria-GFP, BacMam 2.0; #C10600; Thermo Fisher, Invitrogen) according
to the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, RPTECs were seeded 20,000 cells/cm2 to
reach a ~60% confluence and then two different populations of RPTECs were
obtained by separately incubating overnight with 30 particles per cell, (PPC) of
mitochondria-RFP or mitochondria-GFP. The day after transfection, RPTECs were
washed twice, detached by trypsinization, and seeded 1:1 on cover slips in order to
obtain an equal proportion of RPTECs with red- and green-tagged mitochondria.
After 24 h, treatments were started and, at the end of incubations, cells were
examined by confocal inverted laser microscopy (LSM 510 Meta, Zeiss). Nuclei
were counterstained with NucBlue Live ReadyProbes (Hoechst; #R37605; Thermo
Fisher, Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Mitochondrial
exchange among RPTECs was evaluated as the % of Hoechst positive cells with
yellow mitochondria in 10 random fields per sample.
To silence SIRT3, RPTECs were transfected with 100 pmol Silencer Select
predesigned siRNA human SIRT3 (siSIRT3; s23768; Thermo Fisher) or with
control non-target siRNA (siNULL, Silencer Select Negative Control #2siRNA;
Thermo Fisher) using lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Thermo Fisher, Invitrogen)
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. After 24 h from transfection, cells were
incubated with 5 μM cisplatin for 6 h, followed by 24 h incubation with control
medium or human UC-MSCs in transwell, and then used for assessments of SIRT3
mRNA expression, analysis of mitochondrial fragmentation and polarization, mass,
ATP production, and SOD2 expression. Co-staining of SOD and tubulin was also
performed.
To overexpress SIRT3, RPTECs were seeded on 96 or 35 mm2 tissue culture
plates at 70% confluence and were transfected with pCMV-hSIRT3-GFP (pSIRT3;
Origene Technologies, Rockville, MD, USA) or pCMV6-AC-GFP (pNULL;
Origene Technologies) using lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher, Life
Technologies) as described in the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, cells were
incubated with 5 µl of lipofectamine 2000 reagent and 2.5 μg of plasmid DNA
mixed in 2 ml medium for 6 h followed by fresh medium for 24 h and then used for
assessments of SIRT3 mRNA expression, analysis of mitochondrial mass, ATP
production, and SOD2 expression. Co-staining of SOD and tubulin was also
performed.
ATP content assay. Whole renal tissues or human RPTECs were washed twice in
normal 0.9% (w/v) sodium chloride solution and homogenized in a specific buffer
for ATP assay (ATP Assay Kit, BioVision, Milpitas, CA, USA). The sample lysates
were then centrifuged 12,000×g for 10 min at 4 °C, supernatants were harvested
and total protein concentration was determined using DC assay (Bio-Rad
Laboratories, Milan, Italy). Before ATP analysis, supernatants were quickly
removed of proteins by deproteinizing Preparation Kit (BioVision) and then ATP
content was analyzed according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The fluorescence
intensities were determined by the multimode microplate reader TECAN Infinite
M200 PRO (Tecan Group Ltd., Mannedorf, Schweiz) at an excitation wavelength of
Ex 535 nm and emission wavelength of 587 nm. Results were normalized for total
protein concentration of each sample.
NAD+ content assay. Renal tissues or human RPTECs were washed twice in
normal 0.9% (w/v) sodium chloride solution, homogenized in extraction buffer for
NAD+ evaluation (NAD+/NADH Assay Kit, Abnova, Taipei City, Taiwan) and
total protein concentration was determined using DC assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories).
Samples were then processed for determination of NAD+ content by the multi￾mode microplate reader TECAN Infinite M200 PRO (Tecan Group Ltd.) at 565 nm
under controlled temperature for 15 min according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
Results were normalized for total protein concentration of each sample.
Mitochondria isolation and protein extraction. Mitochondria were isolated from
renal tissue or human RPTECs using the Qproteome Mitochondria Isolation Kit
(Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. For total
protein extraction, excised renal tissues or human RPTECs were washed twice in

normal 0.9% (w/v) sodium chloride solution and lysed by homogenization in
CelLytic MT (Sigma-Aldrich) or sonication in mammalian cell lysis buffer (Sigma￾Aldrich), respectively. Both lysis buffers were supplemented with protease inhibitor
cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich) containing 104 mM AEBSF at 80 μM Aprotinin, 4 mM
Bestatin, 1.4 mM E-64, 2 mM Leupeptin, and 1.5 mM Pepstatin A. After homo￾genization, the sample lysates were centrifuged 16,000×g for 10 min at 4 °C and
protein concentration of both isolated mitochondria and total protein extracts was
determined using DC assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories).

obtained by renal tissues or human RPTECs were analyzed with Citrate Synthase
Activity Kit (Sigma-Aldrich) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The citrate
synthase activity was determined by the multimode microplate reader TECAN
Infinite M200 PRO (Tecan Group Ltd.) at 412 nm under controlled temperature on
a kinetic program for 1.5 min every 10 s.
Western blot analysis. Equal amounts of 20 or 30 μg proteins from total extracts
or isolated mitochondria obtained by renal tissues or human RPTECs were sepa￾rated on 7.5–12% sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under
reducing conditions and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad
Laboratories). After blocking with 5% BSA (Sigma-Aldrich) in tris-buffered saline
(TBS) supplemented with 0.1% Tween-20 (Sigma-Aldrich), membranes were
incubated with the following antibodies: rabbit anti-SIRT3 (1:1000; #2627; Cell
Signaling), rabbit anti-SIRT3 antibody (1:1000; #ab86671; Abcam) rabbit anti￾Kif5c (1:500; #HPA035210; Sigma-Aldrich), and rabbit anti-acetyl lysine (1:1000;
#9441; Cell Signaling). On the same membranes, mouse anti-GAPDH (1:1000;
#TA802519 clone 2D9; Origene Technologies) and mouse anti-VDAC (1:1000;
#ab61273; Abcam), were used as sample loading controls for evaluation of protein
expression in total extract and isolated mitochondria, respectively. Acetylated
tubulin expression was evaluated as the ratio between mouse anti-acetylated
tubulin (1:1000; #T7451 clone 6-11B-1; Sigma-Aldrich) and total mouse anti￾tubulin (1:1000; #T9026 clone DM1A; Sigma-Aldrich), after stripping of the same
membrane. The signals were visualized on Odyssey FC Imaging System (LiCor,
Lincoln, Nebraska, USA) by infrared (IR) fluorescence using a goat anti-rabbit
IRDye 680LT (1:1000; LiCor) or a goat anti-mouse IRDye 800CW (1:1000; LiCor)
secondary antibody, as appropriate. Bands were quantified by densitometry using
the Image Studio Lite 5.0 (LiCor) software. All uncropped western blots can be
found in Supplementary Fig. 9.
General methods and statistical analysis. The sample size of the in vivo studies
was estimated to be at least four mice per group to detect the expected difference
with an 80% power (unpaired t-test, two-sided; α = 0.05), based on our previous
published data28 in which mean ± SD of BUN levels were 122 ± 24 mg/dl in cis￾platin mice given saline compared to 58 ± 24 mg/dl in cisplatin mice given MSCs.
For in vitro experiments, the sample size was estimated to be at least three inde￾pendent experiments to detect the expected difference with an 80% power
(unpaired t-test, two-sided; α = 0.05), based on our previous published data20 in
which mean ± SD of mitochondrial polarization ratio was 5.31 ± 0.25 in control
RPTECs compared to 0.35 ± 0.25 in cisplatin-treated RPTECs. Samples/animals
were randomly allocated to the experimental groups and no inclusion/exclusion
criteria were used. In vivo studies in terms of renal function, histology, and SEM/
TEM analysis were performed in a single-blind fashion.
Data are expressed as mean ± SEM of biological replicates. Data analysis was
performed using the computer software Prism (GraphPad Software, Inc.).
Comparisons were made using two-sided unpaired Student’s t test or two-sided
ANOVA with the Bonferroni post hoc test as appropriate. Levene’s test was used to
assess homogeneity of variance between the groups. Statistical significance was
defined as P < 0.05.
All statistical analysis relative to DEGs were carried out in R (R Core Team
(2016). R: A language and environment for statistical computing. R Foundation for
Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria. URL: https://www.R-project.org/.
