Globally, an estimated 71 million people are living with 
chronic HCV infection, with ~2 million new infec￾tions occurring annually1,2
. Key at-risk populations 
for HCV acquisition include people who inject drugs 
(PWID) and HIV-positive men who have sex with 
men (MSM)3,4
. Unsafe health-care practices (includ￾ing unsterile health-care injection) account for a large 
proportion of new HCV infections in low-income and 
middle-income countries1,5
.
One of the goals of the United Nations 2030 Agenda 
for Sustainable Development is the elimination of viral 
hepatitis as a public health threat, with targets includ￾ing a 65% reduction in HCV-related mortality and an 
80% reduction in HCV incidence6,7
. To realize these 
elimination targets, strategies to improve HCV diag￾nosis, treatment and prevention will be required8
. 
Mathematical modelling suggests that substantial reduc￾tions in HCV incidence and prevalence can be achieved 
by scale-up of targeted HCV treatment among those at 
highest risk of ongoing transmission, including PWID 
and HIV-positive MSM9–12.
The development of direct-acting antiviral agents 
(DAAs; for example, grazoprevir–elbasvir13, sofosbuvir–
ledipasvir14 and sofosbuvir–velpatasvir15) has revolutionized 
hepatitis C management and has provided the thera￾peutic tools required to strive for elimination16,17. With 
interferon-free DAAs established as the standard of care 
for chronic HCV infection, the optimal management 
of acute (duration of infection<6 months) and recent 
(duration of infection <12 months) HCV infection is 
uncertain. Much of the evidence regarding timing 
of treatment initiation, regimen choice and duration of 
therapy in recent HCV infection is based on small 
observational studies and randomized controlled trials 
of interferon-based therapy in selected populations. 
Administration of interferon-based therapy in recent HCV 
infection did offer a unique therapeutic advantage, with 
shorter treatment durations (4–12 weeks) and higher effi￾cacy (SVR 72–87%)18–22 in comparison with the same treat￾ment in chronic HCV infection (duration 24–48 weeks, 
SVR< 60%)23,24. The efficacy and optimal duration of 
DAAs in recent HCV infection are being evaluated.

Abstract | The management of acute HCV infection has not been standardized following the 
availability of direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) for chronic HCV infection, and substantial 
uncertainty exists regarding the optimal treatment regimen and duration. Despite the lack of 
direct evidence, the 2016 American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD)–
Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines supported “the same regimens for acute 
HCV as recommended for chronic HCV infection … owing to high efficacy and safety”, whereas 
the 2016 European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) guidelines recommended 
sofosbuvir–ledipasvir, sofosbuvir–velpatasvir or sofosbuvir plus daclatasvir for 8 weeks in acute 
HCV infection, with a longer duration of 12 weeks recommended for those infected with HIV 
and/or baseline HCV RNA levels>1,000,000 IU/ml. This Review outlines the epidemiology, natural 
history and diagnosis of acute HCV infection and provides contemporary information on DAAs for 
acute and recent HCV infection. The Review also discusses the 2016 AASLD–IDSA and EASL 
recommendations for acute HCV infection management in light of available evidence and 
highlights key differences in study populations and design that influence interpretation. We focus 
on populations at high risk of HCV transmission and acquisition, including people who inject 
drugs and HIV-positive men who have sex with men, and highlight the potential effects of 
diagnosis and treatment of acute HCV infection in contributing to HCV elimination.

This Review outlines the epidemiology, natural his￾tory and diagnosis of acute HCV infection and provides 
contemporary information on DAAs for recent HCV 
infection. The Review also discusses the 2016 American 
Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD)– 
Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and 
European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) 
recommendations for acute HCV management in light 
of available evidence and highlights key differences 
in study populations and design that influence inter￾pretation and clinical utility. In this Review, we focus 
on populations at high risk of HCV transmission and 
acquisition, including PWID and HIV-positive MSM, 
and highlight the potential influence of diagnosis and 
treatment of recent HCV infection in contributing to 
HCV elimination.
HCV incidence and transmission
In 2015, an estimated 1.75 million new HCV infec￾tions occurred worldwide (global incidence: 23.7 per 
100,000)1,2
. Although the HCV incidence seems to 
have decreased in the twenty-first century compared 
with that in the second half of the twentieth century 
(reviewed elsewhere25) in most jurisdictions, substan￾tial regional variation exists, with continuing high HCV 
infection incidence in Europe (61.8 per 100,000) and 
the eastern Mediterranean region (62.5 per 100,000)1
. 
Country-specific data demonstrated that the annual 
HCV incidence peaked in the vast majority of countries 
between 1970 and 2005; the exception, with increas￾ing HCV incidence, is Russia26,27. Although unsafe 
health-care procedures account for much of the HCV 
transmission in the eastern Mediterranean region28, 
injecting drug use predominates in Europe, particularly 
in eastern Europe1,29,30.
People who inject drugs. Of the estimated 1.75 million 
new HCV infections in 2015, 23% were attributable to 
current injecting drug use1
 (with an estimated number 
of PWID aged 15–64 years in 2015 of 15.6 million and 
an anti-HCV antibody prevalence among PWID of 
53%31). The majority of new (60%) and existing (80%) 
HCV infections in developed countries occurs among 
PWID3,32, with higher incidence in specific popula￾tions, including young adults (aged<30 years)33–38 and 
those who are incarcerated39–42. HCV acquisition risk 
is greatest among young adults who inject drugs in the 
first years of unsafe injection practices43,44.
Although stable or declining HCV incidence 
among PWID has been reported in some jurisdictions 
(including western Europe and Australia)45,46, sustained 
high or increasing incidence has been reported in 
other regions, including the developing world and the 
United States37,47–49. Data compiled by the US Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention demonstrated that 
whereas HCV incidence remained fairly constant in 
all age groups between 2002 and 2014, an increase 
in incidence was noted between 2010 and 2014 in people 
aged 20–29 years (2010: 0.75 per 100,000; 2014: 2.20 per 
100,000) and people aged 30–39 years (2010: 0.60 
per 100,000; 2014: 1.66 per 100,000)48. This increase 
coincided with HCV (and HIV) infection outbreaks 
among PWID in non-urban communities and was fre￾quently associated with misuse of prescription opiates 
before use of heroin37,47,50. Other demographic and clin￾ical factors associated with HCV seroconversion include 
sharing injecting and drug preparation equipment, high 
injecting frequency, high number of injecting partners, 
type of drug injected, pooling money to purchase drugs, 
unstable housing and HIV co-infection43,45,51–54. Young 
female PWID are at greater risk of HCV acquisition than 
men55,56, which is potentially related to high-risk inject￾ing behaviours in the setting of coexisting sexual and 
injecting relationships55,57.
Access to health services and implementation of 
evidence-based harm reduction programmes are 
necessary to reduce the burden of HCV among PWID, with 
reduced HCV incidence seen among PWID receiv￾ing opioid substitution therapy (OST)36,45,53,58–62. 
Furthermore, the combination of OST and high-coverage 
needle and syringe programmes (ensuring adequate 
needles or syringes to cover all injecting episodes) can 
reduce HCV incidence by up to 80%52,59,63–67.
People with HIV infection. Increasing HCV infection 
incidence and prevalence have been reported in large 
cohorts of HIV-positive MSM over the past decade4,68–78, 
although the overall burden of disease remains mark￾edly lower than that among PWID (with an estimated 
number of people living with HIV–HCV co-infection 
of 2.3 million (including 1.4 million PWID) and an 
anti-HCV antibody prevalence among people with 
HIV infection of 6.2% (MSM 6.4% and PWID 82.4%)79). 
A meta-analysis examining HCV infection incidence 
in HIV-positive MSM who denied ever injecting drugs 
reported an increase in annual incidence from 0.4 per 
100 person-years in 1991 to 1.3 per 100 person-years 
in 2012 (ref.68). However, differences in study design 
have resulted in high variability in incidence estimates 
between cohorts, with HCV infection incidence stabi￾lizing or decreasing in some jurisdictions11,80. Given the 
changes to international guidelines promoting enhanced 
HCV screening among HIV-positive MSM, HCV test￾ing, diagnosis and prevalence have increased in many 
Key points
•	In 2015, an estimated 1.75 million new HCV infections occurred worldwide, with 
injection drug use and unsafe health-care practices being the predominant modes 
of transmission.
•	Access to HCV care, education and treatment for people at high risk of onward 
transmission, including those with acute and recent HCV infection, should be 
a priority.
•	Monitoring HCV RNA levels for between 4 and 12 weeks following diagnosis of acute 
infection provides an opportunity to assessforspontaneous clearance without
compromising outcome.
•	The role of (ultra-)short duration direct-acting antiviral agents in recent HCV infection 
is under investigation; pending the results of large trials, treatment is recommended 
with the same regimens as for chronic HCV infection.
•	Screening of at-risk populations(atleast annually) isrecommended to improve
diagnosis and treatment of acute HCV infection.
•	Early detection and re-treatment ofHCV reinfection, along with education and harm
reduction, should be incorporated into the individual-level and population-level 
HCV response.

European countries, whereas incidence has plateaued or 
decreased in these same countries11,78,80.
The reported increase in HCV infection incidence 
in HIV-positive MSM has been associated with an 
increase in sexual risk behaviour and recreational drug 
use68. Permucosal (sexual) HCV exposure (with blood 
as the medium) seems to facilitate HCV transmission, 
with risk factors for HCV acquisition including con￾domless traumatic anal intercourse, higher number of 
sexual partners, group sex, ulcerative sexually trans￾mitted diseases and sexual acts that involve trauma 
and bleeding68,69,73,74,81–83. The increase in HCV infec￾tion incidence has occurred in parallel with certain 
behavioural trends in MSM communities, including 
use of social media sexual networking applications, 
‘serosorting’ sexual behaviours (use of HIV serostatus 
in decision-making regarding sexual behaviour) and the 
phenomenon of ‘chemsex’ (illicit drug use, largely meth￾amphetamine, before or during sex by both injecting and 
non-injecting routes of administration)83–88, highlight￾ing that HIV-positive MSM and PWID are not mutually 
exclusive. HIV-positive MSM who inject drugs are at 
higher risk of HCV acquisition than HIV-positive MSM 
who do not inject drugs72. However, HIV-positive 
MSM who report injecting drug use could exhibit dif￾ferent drug use and sexual behaviours than non-MSM 
PWID populations traditionally reported in the HCV 
literature, and as such, different management and 
prevention strategies might need to be used.
Although similar sexual risk behaviours have been 
reported in HIV-positive and HIV-negative MSM, 
HCV infection incidence seems to be markedly lower 
in HIV-negative MSM89–92. However, with increasing 
use of HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), there is 
the potential for a reduction in serosorting of sexual 
partners and increased sexual risk behaviour and trans￾mission of HCV among HIV-positive and HIV-negative 
MSM populations83,88,93,94. Incident HCV infections have 
been observed in HIV-negative MSM receiving HIV 
PrEP92,94–96. Phylogenetic analysis of NS5B sequences 
obtained from HCV-positive HIV-negative MSM 
receiving PrEP in Amsterdam (the Netherlands) sug￾gests that HCV transmission is occurring within discrete 
populations, with MSM-specific HCV clusters contain￾ing both HIV-positive and HIV-negative individuals88. 
Although current guidelines do not support routine 
HCV screening of HIV-negative MSM, the increasing 
use of HIV PrEP and overlapping behavioural networks 
support the monitoring of HCV incidence among 
high-risk MSM to guide policy.
Health-care-associated HCV transmission. Unsafe 
health-care procedures (including unsafe health-care 
injection, blood transfusion and other invasive medi￾cal procedures) continue to account for a substantial 
proportion of new HCV infections (15–20% per year), 
largely in developing countries28,97,98. In 2010, an esti￾mated 5% of all health-care injections were given with 
unsterilized, reused equipment, resulting in an esti￾mated 315,000 new HCV infections, most of which 
were in the eastern Mediterranean and southeast 
Asia98. Coupled with poor injection practices, excessive 
medication administration by injection contributes to 
transmission5,97. In these regions, training of health-care 
providers, structural changes to health-care models, 
effective screening and investment in HCV diagnostics, 
disposable materials (ideally with reuse-prevention 
devices) and effective sterilization procedures 
will be required to reduce health-care-associated 
HCV transmission5
.
Following the broad implementation of universal 
infection control procedures, there have been marked 
declines in HCV incidence among haemodialysis popu￾lations in high-income countries99,100, a group previously 
at high risk of HCV acquisition. However, transmission 
outbreaks in dialysis units still occur101, screening is rec￾ommended in these patients102 and high HCV infection 
incidence and prevalence among dialysis-recipients in 
developing countries99 remain a concern.
Diagnosis of acute HCV infection
Difficulties in diagnosis. Acute HCV infection refers 
to the 6-month period following infection acquisition, 
though case definitions vary102–105 (Box 1). Establishing 
the diagnosis of acute HCV infection can be challenging. 
Clinical features suggestive of acute HCV infection 
include marked elevation of alanine aminotransferase 
(ALT) levels (>5–10 times the upper limit of normal) 
and an acute illness manifested by jaundice, fever, head￾ache, malaise, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea or 
abdominal pain32,106. However, only 15–30% of those 
infected with HCV develop a symptomatic illness106, and 
ALT level elevation is nonspecific.
Anti-HCV antibody seroconversion provides the 
most accurate case definition, but the window between 
exposure and seroconversion is variable. Anti-HCV 
antibodies are usually detectable within 6–12 weeks of 
exposure107 but can take up to 12 months in immuno￾compromised individuals108–110 or might not occur at 
all (<5% of those exposed)110, necessitating assessment 
with HCV RNA levels as part of the initial evaluation 
in this population. Furthermore, individuals who have 
cleared previous HCV infection will remain indefinitely 
anti-HCV antibody positive32,111, and as such, HCV RNA 
level is required to diagnose reinfection.
Box 1 | Case definitions for acute HCV infection
Anti-HCV antibody seroconversion
The most accurate case definition of acute HCV infection 
is detection of HCV RNA levels in an individual with 
documented anti-HCV antibody seroconversion
(with test conversion within 12 months)32,102–105.
Acute clinical HCV infection
An acute clinical illness with symptoms and signs
consistent with acute viral hepatitis, including jaundice 
and/or elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT)>5–10 
times the upper limit of normal, with corresponding 
laboratory diagnostic evidence (positive anti-HCV
antibody and/or detectableHCV RNA)32,102–105,130.
HCV RNA detected, anti-HCV antibody negative
Detection ofHCVRNAwith a negative anti-HCVantibody
result,followed by seroconversion,suggests very recent
infection with exposure in the previous 6–8 weeks32,103.

No definitive laboratory test exists to distinguish 
acute from chronic HCV infection. Certain features 
can be suggestive of acute infection, including low 
(<104
 international units (IU)/ml) or fluctuating 
(>1 log10 IU/ml) serum HCV RNA titre112,113. Although 
the use of HCV core antigen testing is supported for 
diagnosis of acute HCV infection105, test performance 
(largely sensitivity) and subsequent clinical utility are 
affected by the potential for low-level viraemia in acute 
infection, with the lower limit of HCV core antigen 
detection equivalent to 500–3,000 HCV RNA IU/ml 
depending on HCV genotype114,115.
Point-of-care tests for HCV infection, particularly 
for HCV RNA, have the potential to simplify diag￾nostic and screening algorithms, increase acute HCV 
infection diagnoses and facilitate early linkage to care 
and treatment. Point-of-care HCV testing can include 
oral fluid rapid diagnostic testing116–120, finger-stick 
whole blood rapid diagnostic testing117–122, on-site 
venepuncture-based testing123,124 and finger-stick capil￾lary whole blood testing125,126. Although most of these 
tests detect anti-HCV antibody, point-of-care HCV 
RNA assays that are available or in late-stage develop￾ment include the Xpert HCV Viral Load (Cepheid) test, 
HCV ID Kit (Genedrive) and Truenat HCV (Molbio). 
Validation of these tests in the setting of recent HCV 
infection is ongoing.
Screening strategies in high-risk populations. 
Different screening strategies for HCV infection have 
been recommended and implemented depending on 
regional epidemiology102,105,127,128. As documentation 
of seroconversion is often difficult, routine monitor￾ing of at-risk populations is recommended to improve 
diagnosis of acute HCV infection. All PWID should be 
screened for HCV with anti-HCV antibody, and in the 
setting of ongoing injecting drug use, screening every 
6–12 months should be performed to assess for 
incident infection102,105,129. Similarly, all newly diagnosed 
HIV-positive individuals should be screened for HCV 
antibody102,130. HIV-positive MSM at risk of HCV acqui￾sition should be reviewed every 6–12 months with assess￾ments for ALT levels and anti-HCV antibody130. After 
potential exposure (via injecting drug use and/or high-risk 
sexual behaviour) or diagnosis of a sexually transmit￾ted infection in MSM, additional HCV screening with 
anti-HCV antibody should be considered and repeated 
3 months later if negative130. HCV RNA assays should be 
performed if transaminases (particularly ALT) are ele￾vated or if HCV reinfection is suspected131. If these recom￾mendations are adhered to, both HCV primary infection 
and reinfection should be identified within the first year of 
acquisition. As such, a broader definition of recent HCV 
infection (duration of infection <12 months) has greater 
utility in guiding policy and management decisions.
Management of recent HCV infection
Natural history and spontaneous clearance. The nat￾ural history of recent HCV infection must be taken 
into consideration when determining the optimal 
management strategy. The complex interplay between 
host and virus in acute infection results in either 
viral persistence (75–85%) or spontaneous clearance 
(15–25%)132–136, with divergence in HCV RNA dynam￾ics between the two groups occurring at approximately 
3 months after infection113 (Fig. 1). In most cases, spon￾taneous clearance occurs in the first 6 months (67–86%) 
or 12 months (83–95%) following HCV acquisition137–140. 
Both host113,132,134,136,139,141–146 and viral113,136,147,148
factors have been associated with spontaneous clear￾ance, although the evidence for and importance of host 
factors is most robust (Box 2). Single-nucleotide poly￾morphisms in the IFNL3 and IFNL4 genes (formerly 
IL28B) have been identified that strongly predict both 
spontaneous clearance and clearance in response to 
interferon-based therapy136. Broad and multi-specific 
CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses are associated with 
spontaneous clearance, whereas the failure of a sustained 
T cell response of sufficient magnitude is associated with 
viral persistence142,143. Unsurprisingly, immunocom￾promised hosts have a reduced chance of spontaneous

Fig. 1 | Viral kinetics in acute HCV infection. a | Acute HCV infection results in either 
spontaneous clearance (red) or viral persistence (blue green) and chronic HCV infection. 
Three phases have been described between exposure and seroconversion: the 
‘pre-ramp-up’ phase (2–14 days) with intermittent low-level viraemia, potentially below 
the level of detection (not shown), the ‘ramp-up’ phase (8–10 days) with an exponential 
rise in HCV RNA and the ‘plateau’ phase (45–68 days) in which HCV RNA stabilizes. 
b | Divergence in HCV RNA dynamics in individuals who demonstrate spontaneous 
clearance and in those who have viral persistence occurs at approximately 3 months 
following infection. Among individuals with viral persistence, two HCV RNA patterns are 
noted — viral plateau with persistence (blue) and partial viral control with persistence 
(green). Among individuals with partial viral control and persistence, an initial marked 
decline in HCV RNA (potentially below the level of quantification) is followed by viral 
rebound, representing viral escape from innate responses or a failure of HCV-specific 
adaptive responses. Adapted from ref.113, CC BY 4.0.

clearance (≤20%)110,133,141,149–153. Despite extensive study 
of the innate and adaptive immune responses in acute 
and chronic HCV infection, the specific immunologi￾cal characteristics during the acute phase of infection 
that predict clearance remain incompletely understood 
(reviewed elsewhere154,155).
Timing of HCV treatment initiation. The potential for 
spontaneous clearance needs to be weighed against 
early treatment initiation. Clinical trial data examining 
the utility of interferon-based therapy suggested that 
observation for 12 weeks following diagnosis of acute 
HCV infection provided an opportunity to assess for 
spontaneous clearance without compromising treatment 
efficacy, whereas a more prolonged delay (>12 weeks) 
risked losing individuals to follow-up156,157. Additionally, 
monitoring HCV RNA kinetics in the first 4–12 weeks 
after diagnosis could assist in optimizing early treat￾ment initiation112,137. For instance, among HIV-positive 
MSM, a decline in HCV RNA levels of ≥2 log10 IU/ml 
at week 4 after diagnosis was associated with spontane￾ous clearance, whereas detectable HCV RNA at week 12 
after diagnosis was associated with persistence130,158,159. 
Subsequent demonstration of the clinical utility of viral 
kinetic monitoring in the 4 weeks following diagnosis 
followed by early treatment (if spontaneous clearance is 
deemed unlikely) has influenced acute HCV treatment 
recommendations in this population130,159,160.
There is no role for pre-exposure or post-exposure 
prophylaxis in HCV infection102,105. The natural history of 
HCV infection, efficacy of DAAs and cost-effectiveness 
modelling do not support pre-emptive therapy161. 
Instead, appropriate testing and expedient treatment, 
if required, are recommended.
DAAs for acute and recent HCV infection. The treat￾ment paradigm for chronic HCV infection has evolved 
rapidly, with dual-class and triple-class DAA regi￾mens for 8–12 weeks achieving very high SVR (>95%) 
in treatment-naive individuals without cirrhosis16,17. 
Although this DAA approach has markedly reduced 
the relevance of enhanced interferon-based treatment 
outcomes in acute HCV infection, the potential for 
shortened duration therapy in acute and recent HCV 
infection underpins current treatment recommenda￾tions and research questions. Compared with chronic 
HCV infection (treatment duration 24–48 weeks, SVR at 
24 weeks (SVR24)<60%)23,24, clinical trials of shortened 
duration (4–12 weeks) PEG-IFN with and without riba￾virin demonstrated superior efficacy in acute and recent 
HCV infection (SVR24 72–87%)18–22, with similar effi￾cacy in populations with acute (<6 months)19,20,157,162–166
and early chronic (6–24 months) infection22,166.
The optimal management of acute HCV infection in 
the era of DAAs is yet to be defined. The 2016 AASLD–
IDSA guidelines support “the same [direct-acting 
antiviral] regimens for acute HCV as recommended for 
chronic HCV infection … owing to high efficacy and 
safety” (level of evidence: class IIa, level C), whereas the 
2016 EASL guidelines recommend sofosbuvir plus a 
non-structural protein 5A (NS5A) inhibitor (sofosbuvir–
ledipasvir, sofosbuvir–velpatasvir or sofosbuvir plus 
daclatasvir) for 8 weeks in acute HCV infection (level 
of evidence: class IIb, level C), with a longer duration of 
12 weeks recommended for those with HIV and/or 
baseline HCV RNA>1,000,000 (>6 log10) IU/ml (level of 
evidence: class IIb, level C). Current international recom￾mendations for the treatment of acute HCV infection are 
controversial, are not supported by robust evidence and 
will evolve pending the results of current and future clin￾ical trials. Several small clinical trials and cohort studies 
of shortened duration DAA therapy have been conducted 
(Table 1; Supplementary Table 1), and larger trials are 
underway (Table 2) to fill this evidence gap. Pilot stud￾ies of a single DAA, sofosbuvir, with ribavirin showed 
suboptimal efficacy in acute and recent HCV infection 
and are not recommended167,168.
Shortened duration dual-class and triple-class DAA 
regimens for 4, 6 and 8 weeks have demonstrated 
promising results (Fig. 2). In acute HCV genotype 1 
mono-infection, very high SVR was demonstrated with 
6 weeks of sofosbuvir–ledipasvir (26 of 26 patients; SVR 
at 12 weeks (SVR12) intention to treat (ITT) 100%)169. 
Notably, PWID were excluded, and the vast majority 
of study participants had symptomatic infection and 
low baseline HCV RNA levels (median 4.0 log10 IU/ml; 
≤3 log10 IU/ml, 45%). Again, in a preliminary report in 
acute HCV genotype 1 mono-infection, high SVR was 
demonstrated with 4 weeks of sofosbuvir–ledipasvir 
(14 of 14 patients; SVR12 ITT 100%) and 8 weeks of 
sofosbuvir plus simeprevir (13 of 15 patients; SVR12 ITT 
87%)170. Viral suppression was rapid, with HCV RNA 
levels below the limit of detection in 93% at week 1 
among participants who received either sofosbuvir–
ledipasvir or sofosbuvir plus simeprevir. Current PWID 
were excluded. This study is yet to be formally published, 
and as such, without a fuller description of the study 
design, definitions and methodology, no firm conclu￾sions can be drawn. Among HIV-positive MSM, lower 
SVR (20 of 26 patients; SVR12 ITT 77%; per-protocol 
87%) was demonstrated with 6 weeks of sofosbuvir–
ledipasvir for acute HCV genotypes 1a and 4 (ref.171). The 
mean baseline HCV RNA level was 5.4 log10 IU/ml. 
The majority of study participants were asymptomatic; 
two participants presented with jaundice, and both were

receiving atazanavir. Of the six participants who did 
not achieve SVR12, three experienced post-treatment 
relapse, one was reinfected before post-treatment week 4, 
and two were lost to follow-up after achieving SVR4. 
The three participants with relapse had high baseline 
HCV RNA levels (>6.9 log10 IU/ml). Among people with 
acute and recent HCV genotype 1, excellent efficacy has 
been reported with 8 weeks of paritaprevir–ritonavir–
ombitasvir and dasabuvir172 (29 of 30 patients; SVR12 
ITT 97%; per-protocol 100%) and in a preliminary 
report with 8 weeks of sofosbuvir–ledipasvir171 (27 of 
27 patients; SVR12 ITT 100%). Combined, these pilot 
studies offer exciting potential but are limited by small 
sample sizes, selected populations and, in some cases, 
lack of formal published results.
Marked differences in study design and cohort 
characteristics limit meaningful comparison and 
generalization with published guidelines (Table 2; 
Supplementary Table 1). Most of the study popula￾tions have been highly selected, often delineated by 
HIV serostatus. Unfortunately, current PWID have 
largely been excluded169,170,173, a population in which tar￾geted screening and treatment of acute HCV infection 
could be most useful to prevent ongoing transmission. 
Additionally, different or unclear definitions of dura￾tion of infection make comparison and implementation 
uncertain. As the distinction between acute and early 
chronic infection is somewhat arbitrary, further research 
regarding treatment initiation within 1 year of infection 
would permit broad clinical application.
Predictors of response to shortened duration DAA 
therapy in acute HCV infection. Baseline HCV 
RNA level and early on-treatment viral kinetics seem 
to influence response to short duration DAA therapy 
(treatment duration≤6 weeks)174. A higher baseline HCV 
RNA level (>6 log10 IU/ml) seems to be associated with 
post-treatment relapse following short duration therapy 
in acute167,175 and chronic176 HCV infection. In prelimi￾nary results from two acute HCV infection clinical trials 
examining an 8-week duration of sofosbuvir–ledipasvir171
and paritaprevir–ritonavir–ombitasvir and dasabuvir172, 
baseline HCV RNA level did not affect efficacy.
Given the potential for high, fluctuating HCV RNA 
levels in recent HCV infection113, an ultra-short dura￾tion therapeutic strategy might require stratification 
by baseline HCV RNA titres. There is precedent for 
this approach in chronic HCV infection, with post hoc 
analysis of the ION-3 trial forming the basis for pre￾scribing guidelines regarding shortening the treatment 
duration of sofosbuvir–ledipasvir from 12 weeks to 8 
weeks in treatment-naive individuals who have chronic

HCV genotype 1 infection and baseline HCV RNA lev￾els <6,000,000 IU/ml but do not have cirrhosis14,177,178. 
Among treatment-naive individuals in China with 
chronic HCV genotype 1b infection and without 
cirrhosis (n = 18), a pilot study evaluated ultra-short 
duration response-guided triple-class DAA therapy179. 
Very high SVR (100%) was seen among those who 
received 3 weeks of DAAs after achieving an ultra-rapid 
viral response (defined as HCV RNA titre<500 IU/ml 
after 48 h). Participants with an ultra-rapid viral 
response had a significantly lower mean baseline HCV 
RNA level than those without an ultra-rapid viral 
response (HCV RNA 6.0 log10 IU/ml (s.d. 0.8) versus 
7.0 log10 IU/ml (s.d. 0.3); P < 0.001), suggesting that 
baseline HCV RNA levels can assist in predicting which 
individuals might respond favourably to short duration 
therapy, although the findings need confirmation in 
other populations (such as in different ethnicities or in 
patients infected with different genotypes). Although 
the 2016 EASL guidelines support stratification of treat￾ment duration by HIV serostatus and baseline HCV 
RNA levels105, the evidence for this recommendation 
is very limited.
Future research directions. The role, efficacy and 
cost-effectiveness of interferon-free DAA therapy in 
the management of recent HCV infection require fur￾ther evaluation. It is uncertain whether the paradigm 
of shortened treatment duration in recent, as com￾pared with chronic, HCV infection will hold true with 
interferon-free therapy. Although the data from small 
studies support this concept (Table 1), the results of 
larger (randomized) clinical trials are awaited to con￾firm these findings (Table 2). To robustly evaluate the 
efficacy of ultra-short duration DAA therapy, optimal 
regimen choice will be critical. Mathematical model￾ling suggests that rapid on-treatment second-phase 
viral decline, as seen after administration of HCV 
non-structural protein 3 (NS3) and/or non-structural 
protein 4 A (NS4A) protease inhibitors and NS5A 
inhibitors, permits shorter (potentially by weeks) 
treatment durations180,181. Additional modelling sug￾gests that analysis of early on-treatment viral kinetics 
reduces DAA treatment duration, with individualized 
(response-guided) therapy associated with a projected 
average cost saving of 16–20% per 100 patients with 
chronic HCV infection treated174. However, treatment 
individualization increases complexity and limits utility. 
Cost-effectiveness analysis supports the immediate 
treatment of acute HCV infection with short duration 
DAAs (4–6 weeks) as compared with treatment deferral 
until chronic infection (treatment duration 8–12 weeks), 
as there are cost savings associated with shorter duration 
and reduced transmission182.
The effect of clinical, virological and immuno￾logical factors on efficacy, as measured by factors such 
as HIV infection, baseline HCV RNA levels, clinical 
presentation and duration of infection, remains to be 
adequately determined. Although administration of 
interferon in acute HCV infection seemed to have a 
unique role in improving response to therapy owing 
to differences in expression of interferon-stimulated 
genes183, the effect of host genetics and immune response 
on treatment outcome with DAAs in recent HCV 
infection is unknown.
Studies to date have been largely restricted to acute 
HCV genotype 1 infection169,175. A pan-genotypic strat￾egy would be ideal for clinical implementation and 
might permit a simplified management strategy in which 
assessment of HCV genotype is no longer required and 
a single short duration DAA regimen would be suitable 
for most people with acute and recent HCV infection. 
The FDA approval of glecaprevir–pibrentasvir in August 
2017 (ref.184), an 8-week pan-genotypic regimen for 
people with chronic HCV infection without cirrhosis 
(fibrosis stage 0–3), suggests that such an approach is 
possible for the vast majority of people infected with 
HCV regardless of duration of infection. Large studies of

pan-genotypic DAAs in well-characterized populations 
(including people with HIV infection or PWID) will be 
extremely valuable in determining the utility of DAAs 
in recent HCV infection. With high HCV infection 
incidence in populations of PWID and HIV-positive 
MSM, determining the optimal timing of treatment 
initiation, duration of therapy and regimen choice in 
recent infection is important (including for treatment 
of reinfection). If ultra-short duration therapy with an 
optimal DAA regimen is shown to be highly effective in 
individuals in the first year after infection acquisition, 
this finding will have major implications for screening 
and treatment strategies in high-risk populations.
Reinfection after treatment
One challenge to HCV elimination is reinfection. 
Higher HCV reinfection incidence after treatment in 
acute HCV cohorts (reinfection incidence 7.4–15.2 per 
100 person-years)68,185–187 (Table 3) contrasts with the 
majority of published and preliminary studies among 
individuals treated for chronic HCV infection 
(reinfection incidence 0–5 per 100 person-years)188–190. 
The risk of reinfection after treatment for both acute 
and chronic HCV infection is higher in those who 
report ongoing high-risk behaviour (such as contin￾ued injection drug use)187,189,191–193, highlighting the 
need for post-treatment surveillance, rapid diagnosis of 
reinfection and access to re-treatment.
Although injecting risk behaviour among PWID 
seemed to decline following interferon-based 
treatment194–196, it is possible that expanded HCV 
treatment access and DAA therapeutic optimism 
might be associated with increased risk behaviour, 
as seen among MSM following the introduction of 
HIV combination antiretroviral therapy197. The inci￾dence of HCV reinfection will require robust evalu￾ation with sufficient follow-up time and HCV RNA 
testing at regular intervals. Although annual HCV 
RNA testing is recommended to monitor at-risk indi￾viduals, the optimal interval (3, 6 or 12 months) for 
repeated HCV RNA testing requires investigation, as 
testing frequency will affect reinfection detection198. 
Routine post-treatment surveillance should ensure 
that reinfection is diagnosed within the first year of 
re-acquisition, which will have substantial implications 
for therapeutic strategies in recent HCV infection. 
Additionally, characterization of reinfection and the 
host–virus interplay in the setting of re-exposure might 
assist in vaccine development.
As DAA treatment scale-up expands among 
populations exhibiting ongoing risk behaviours for 
reacquisition (including recent PWID and HIV-positive 
MSM), acknowledgement that HCV reinfection can and 
will occur is essential. HCV reinfection prevention 
and management strategies should be incorporated 
into the individual-level and population-level HCV 
responses (Box  3). Options include education and 
counselling199, optimal harm reduction36,46,53,58–60,62,65,200, 
treatment of the individual and their injecting (or sex￾ual) partner or people in their network201, management 
of medical and psychiatric comorbidity62, post-treatment 
surveillance202 and rapid re-treatment of reinfection. At a 
population level, universal access to care and treatment, 
political will, sufficient funding and alleviation of the 
stigma associated with HCV infection should assist in 
efforts to reduce HCV primary and reinfection inci￾dence. Most importantly, re-treatment for reinfection 
should be offered without stigma or discrimination.
HCV treatment as prevention
The availability of DAAs has provided the therapeutic 
tools required to strive for HCV elimination and 
has stimulated discussion around HCV treatment 
as prevention8
. To achieve elimination, strategies to 
curb transmission will be required. One approach to reduce 
transmission is improved diagnosis and treatment of 
recent HCV infection. Mathematical modelling sug￾gests that substantial reductions in HCV incidence 
and prevalence can be achieved by targeted DAA 
treatment scale-up among those at highest risk of ongo￾ing transmission, including PWID and HIV-positive 
MSM11,203–206. Data from the UK Collaborative HIV 
Cohort predicted that the greatest effect on HCV 
incidence and prevalence would be achieved if DAA 
scale-up was prioritized to those with recently diag￾nosed (<1 year) HCV infection and if it occurred in 
combination with behavioural interventions11. Despite 
the high cost of DAAs, treating recent PWID and 
HIV-positive MSM with early liver disease associated 
with HCV infection seems to be cost-effective given 
the reduction in liver-related complications and addi￾tional benefit of averting secondary infections9,207,208. In 
jurisdictions with universal access to DAAs, encourag￾ing initial reports highlight high DAA uptake among 
HIV-positive MSM, with corresponding reductions 
in HCV viraemic prevalence209,210 and incidence209. 
Modelling estimates and real-world data support broad 
access to DAAs, without limitations based on dura￾tion of infection, disease stage or drug use, to gain the 
greatest individual-level and population-level benefits.

Recommendations
Management of recent HCV infection in the era of 
DAAs. Interferon-free DAA therapy is not currently 
approved by regulatory authorities for use in acute 
HCV infection. Although encouraging results follow￾ing short duration therapy have been obtained in small 
cohorts169,170, enrolment in prospective clinical trials 
is recommended to confirm this strategy. Pending the 
results of these clinical trials, people with acute HCV 
infection might be considered for treatment with the 
same DAA regimens as recommended for chronic 
HCV infection. Monitoring HCV RNA titres for 4–12 
weeks following diagnosis of acute infection provides an 
opportunity to assess for spontaneous clearance before 
treatment initiation156–158. Given the individual-level 
and population-level benefits, access to HCV care and 
treatment for people at high risk of onward transmission, 
including those with recent HCV infection, should be 
a priority8
.
Screening strategies in high-risk populations. Greater 
HCV testing (increasing access as well as regular test￾ing and follow-up), diagnosis and linkage to care are 
required to facilitate DAA treatment scale-up. All 
PWID and HIV-positive MSM should be screened for 
HCV infection with anti-HCV antibody102,105,129,130. In 
the context of ongoing risk behaviour (injection drug 
use and/or high-risk sexual behaviour), anti-HCV 
antibody screening every 6–12 months should be per￾formed to assess for incident infection102,105,129, with 
supplemental testing following potential exposure130. 
Assessment of HCV viraemia with HCV RNA should 
occur if there is high clinical suspicion, if transaminase 
(particularly ALT) levels are elevated or if HCV reinfec￾tion is suspected. Screening protocols for recent HCV 
infection in specific high-risk populations, including 
young PWID55,139,211, PWID in incarceration41,212 and 
HIV-positive MSM69,213, should be considered214,215, 
potentially utilizing rapid or point-of-care diagnos￾tics118,119,121,216, to improve HCV diagnosis, prevention 
and surveillance.
Conclusions
The advent of highly effective, well-tolerated 
interferon-free DAA therapy has revolutionized HCV 
therapeutics16. Combining two or more potent DAAs 
from different classes has increased SVR (>90%) and 
shortened treatment duration to only 8–12 weeks in 
most populations with chronic HCV infection. Excellent 
results in chronic HCV infection have lessened the 
potential ‘efficacy advantage’ of early treatment initiation 
in acute HCV infection, but diagnosis and treatment of 
recent HCV infection should facilitate engagement in 
multidisciplinary care, prevent the development and 
complications of chronic liver disease and curb ongoing 
transmission in key populations. The role of ultra-short 
duration DAA therapy in recent HCV infection requires 
further evaluation.
The burden of disease attributed to HCV is high 
among PWID and is increasing among HIV-infected 
MSM. The potential for broad access, rapid DAA 
treatment scale-up and further treatment simplification 
has stimulated discussion around HCV treatment as 
prevention and HCV elimination8
. HCV treatment 
as prevention strategies will be improved by early

diagnosis and increased treatment uptake in recent 
HCV infection11,203. Ultimately, the population-level 
effects of DAA therapy will relate to facilitating global 
access to HCV screening, care and treatment217. The risk 
of HCV reinfection following treatment in individuals 
with ongoing behaviour facilitating HCV transmission 
emphasizes the need for post-treatment surveillance, 
harm reduction strategies and education but must not 
be considered an impediment to treatment if HCV 
elimination is to be achieved.
