Abstract
Background: Infection, even outbreak, caused by Cryptococcus gattii (C. gattii) has been reported in Canada and
the United States, but there were sparsely-reported cases of C. gattii in China. Our interest in occurrence, clinical
manifestation, laboratory identification and molecular characterization of Chinese C. gattii strains leads us to this
research.
Results: Out of 254 clinical isolates, initially identified as Cryptococcus neoformans (C. neoformans), eight strains were
re-identified as C. gattii. Multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) showed genotype VGI accounted for the most (6 / 8),
the other two strains were genotype VGII (VGIIa and VGIIb respectively) with 3 specific spectra of molecular weight
about 4342, 8686, 9611 Da by MALDI-TOF MS. The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of Fluconazole with
Yeast one was 2~4 times higher than that with ATB fungus 3 and MICs of antifungal agents against VGII strains
were higher than against VGI strains. Comparative proteome analysis showed that 329 and 180 proteins were
highly expressed by C. gattii VGI and VGII respectively. The enrichment of differentially expressed proteins was
directed to Golgi complex.
Conclusions: Infection by C. gattii in China occurred sparsely. Genotype VGI was predominant but VGII was more
resistant to antifungal agents. There was significant difference in protein expression profile between isolates of VGI
and VGII C. gattii.

Background
Cryptococcus gattii (C. gattii), one of the most common
pathogenic cryptococcal species, primarily infects im￾munocompetent hosts, in contrast to Cryptococcus neo￾formans (C. neoformans), which mainly infects
immunocompromised individuals [1, 2]. Previous studies
revealed that C. gattii infection was restricted geograph￾ically to tropical and subtropical regions [1–3]. However,
outbreaks have been recorded in temperate regions, such
as British Columbian of Canada and Pacific Northwest
of the United States [4, 5]. The majority of Chinese
people reside in temperate and subtropical regions with
climates suitable for fungal growth and the incidence of
cryptococcal infection increased in recent years, unfortu￾nately, little investigation has been carried out on this
organism in China [6]. The objectives of the present
study were to determine the frequency of C. gattii infec￾tion, to investigate clinical and microbiological
characterization, and to analyze molecular features of
the Chinese isolates.

Results
Identification and antifungal susceptibility profile of C.
gattii isolates
Among 254 collected Cryptococcal strains, eight showed
blue pigmentation on canavanine glycine bromothymol
blue (CGB) agar and were characterized as C.gattii by
matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight
mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) with scores from
2.043 to 2.275, otherwise they were all identified as
C.neoformans by VITEK 2 compact as seen in Table 1.
The mass spectra obtained from eight C. gattii isolates
were characterized by diverse spectra in the range be￾tween 2000 and 10,000 Da. Three specific spectra with
molecular weight of about 4342, 8686, 9611 Da could be
seen in two isolates of C. gattii VGII, they were absent
in six isolates of C. gattii VGI, as shown in Fig.1. The
dendrogram created by MALDI Biotyper divided eight
isolates into two groups of C. gattii VGI and VGII as
shown in Fig.2. The MICs of six antifungal drugs to
eight strains of C. gattii were listed in Table 1.
MLST analysis and genotyping
MLST confirmed six strains of C. gattii VGI and two
strains of C. gattii VGII as indicated in supplementary
Table 1. The 2 strains of isolate number 1 and 6 with
C.gattii genotype VGII could be subtyped into VGIIa
and VGIIb respectively by further comparison with Van￾couver Island reference stains of R265 and R272, as in
supplementary Table 2. Some gene mutation existed in
unlinked gene loci such as FTR1 and RAS1 as indicated
in Fig.3.
Clinical information of patients infected with C. gattii
As shown in Table 1, the eight strains of C. gattii were
isolated from eight patients. Two patients with isolate
numbers of 2 and 6 were from Hainan and Yunnan
Province, which were recognized as tropical areas. Three
patients with isolate number 3 (from Chongqing city), 4
and 7 (from Fujian Province) were recognized as being
from subtropical area. The other three patients with iso￾late numbers of 1, 5 and 8 were from Shandong Prov￾ince, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and Henan
Province, which were recognized as temperate regions.
Information of patient infected with isolate number 3
was unavailable, the other 7 patients were immunocom￾petent young male adults, with age range of 21~60 years
old. Their clinical and laboratory information were sum￾marized in Table 2.
Differential protein analysis between C. gattii VGI and
VGII
In this study, the proteome expression profiles of two
strains of VGII and four strains of VGI C. gattii were
created. A total of 3628 proteins were identified, of
which, 2436 proteins were found in both VGII and VGI
C. gattii, however, C. gattii genotype VGI and VGII pos￾sessed 774 and 418 specific proteins respectively. Com￾parative proteome analysis showed that 329 and 180
proteins were highly expressed in C. gattii VGI and VGII

as shown in Fig.4. A cluster analysis of the differentially
expressed proteins was shown in Fig. 5.
The information of GO term and KEGG metabolic
pathway analysis indicated that the enrichment of differ￾ential expressed proteins between VGI and VGII was
mainly directed to Golgi apparatus, Golgi membrane and
Golgi vesicle as shown in Table 3. The most significant
enriched metabolic pathways were oxidative phosphoryl￾ation, ribosome and metabolic pathway as shown in Fig.6.
Discussion
Selection of identification method and drug resistance of
Chinese C. gattii strains
C. neoformans and C. gattii are two important fungal
pathogens for humans and animals. Both of them are
round with capsule and positive urease test. These rou￾tine laboratory identification methods are unable to dis￾tinguish the two species [7]. Although there were several
reports about infection of C. gattii from China [8–10],
the number of C. gattii infections may have been under￾estimated because most laboratories utilize ink staining
and biochemical methods, like VITEK 2 compact, for
routine identificatio. CGB agar was recommended to
identify C. gattii from C. neoformans due to its conveni￾ence and low cost [7], but it took longer time to get the
result. Molecular methods would be faster and more ac￾curate for differentiation of the two pathogenic Crypto￾cocci species. However, they are not available in all
clinical laboratories, where an accurate identificaction of
species should be made in order to install the proper

treatment. In this study, eight strains of C. gattii were
not only correctly identified but also grouped by
MALDI-TOF MS with Bruker software 3.0. Of course,
eight strains was not enough and more strains should be
studied to obtain the spectrum difference between
groups of C. gattii.
The results of antifungal susceptibility test by two kits
were in good agreement, except that MICs of Flucona￾zole were 2~4 times higher by Yeast one than by ATB
fungus 3. All the C.gattii isolates were susceptible to 5-
Flucytosine, Amphotericin B, Itraconazole, Voriconazole
and Posaconazole, only one strain was resistant to Flu￾conazole with MIC of 128 by Yeast one. However, inter￾pretation of MICs of antifungal agents including
Fluconazole for category of “susceptibility” or “resist￾ance” was hampered by the lack of clinical breakpoints
for C. gattii. Some previous studies have shown that C.
gattii may be less susceptible to antifungal agents com￾pared with C. neoformans. In a study from Taiwan, C.
gattii was less susceptible to 5-Flucytosine and ampho￾tericin B, and in Spain, MICs of Fluconazole, Voricona￾zole and Posaconazole to C. gattii were significantly
higher [11–13]. The correlation between susceptibility
profile and genotype of C. gattii has rarely been studied
[14], our data indicated that antifungal agents exhibited
higher MICs against isolates of genotype VGII than
genotype VGI, which agreed with the data of Hagen
et al. and Lockhart et al. [14–17]. However, Clinical rele￾vance between MIC breakpoint and epidemiological cut￾off value (ECV) based on MIC distributions of wild-type
strains has currently been studied on both C. neoformans
and C. gattii isolates from Europe, USA, Australia,
Brazil, Canada, India and South Africa. ECVs of Ampho￾tericin B (0.5~1 μg/ml), 5-Flucytosine (4~16 μg/ml), Flu￾conazole (8~32 μg/ml) and other azoles varied similarly
by molecular type for both C. neoformans and C. gattii
[15, 16].
Molecular and epidemical characteristics of Chinese C.
gattii strains
Up to now, four genotypes of C. gattii have been de￾tected, they were VGI, VGII, VGIII and VGIV. Lockhart
and colleagues had reported that VGII and VGIII were
the most-frequently identified isolates in America, VGIV
was almost exclusively in Africa, and VGI predominated
in Europe, Australia and Asia [18]. C. gattii, as an im￾portant pathogen, caused outbreak in British Columbia,
Canada and the Pacific Northwest, the United States.
But 8 strains in our study were pathogens causing spor￾adic infections according to the strain origination and
their isolation time.
Patient information and clinical characteristics
All the patients in our study had no recent travel history,
the C. gattii infection occurred regionally and domestic￾ally. They were immunocompetent young male adults
with age range of 21~60 years old, which was considered
as the reason for increased exposure to environmental

sources and increased chance for infection [19]
.
. Most pa￾tients had headache and fever, three patients showed neck
stiffness, positive Kernig’s sign and meningeal lesions,
meningeal enhancement or lacunar infarction by brain
MRI. Most of them also demonstrated irregular nodule,
consolidation and mass by lung CT, which was consistent
with the research made by Ngamskulrungroj who indi￾cated that C. gattii could cause fatal lung infection [20].
It was reported that host response varied based on the
genotype of the organism and concomitant illnesses
[21]. There was also study which revealed that C. gattii
VGII strains were more virulent than VGI strains and
VGIIa were even more virulent than VGIIb independent
of their clinical or environmental origin [22]. In our
study, all patients were treated by Fluconazole plus
amphotericin B, most of them improved effectively with￾out severe neurological sequelae. This might be ex￾plained by the fact that these patients infected by C.
gattii VGI more than C. gattii VGII on the one hand,
and on the other hand, two of them were infected with
C. gattii VGII which showed sequence mutations in the
gene location of RAS1 and FTR1 compared with refer￾ence strains of R265 and R272 respectively. Whether the
mutations were relevant to virulence decrease, further
work needs to be done.
Analysis of differentially expressed protein in two
genotypes of C. gattii
Our study showed significant difference in protein ex￾pression spectra between VGI and VGII. GO is a very

important tool of biological information. By establishing
a set of controlled words with dynamic form, the attri￾butes of genes and gene products in organisms can be
described comprehensively. KEGG is the main public
database with which the most important biochemical
metabolic pathways and signal transduction pathways
can be determined. Our results suggested that the differ￾ential protein of C. gattii VGI and VG II was mainly lo￾cated on the organelles associated with the Golgi body,
which meant energy metabolism of C. gattii might be in￾volved in the difference of pathogenesis mechanism for
different genotype of C. gattii. Study on the secretory

of C. gattii would be beneficial to the understanding of
the pathogenesis of C. gattii.
Conclusions
In spite that only 8 strains were available for analysis,
our results demonstrated that C. gattii genotype VGI
was predominant in China and C. gattii genotype VGII
was more resistant to antifungal agents. C. gattii VGII
isolates possessed obvious protein peaks with molecular
weight of approximate 4342, 8686, 9611 Da. The full
protein spectrum data of C.gattii were provided for the
first time, a total of 3628 proteins were identified, 329
and 180 proteins were highly expressed by C. gattii VGI
and VGII respectively. The enrichment of differentially
expressed proteins between VGI and VGII was mainly
directed to Golgi complex. It will lay a foundation for
better understanding and further research on the patho￾genic mechanism for different genotype of C. gattii.
Methods
Collection and initial identification of clinical isolates
A total of 254 clinical isolates initially identified as C.
neoformans by biochemical methods were collected from
seven hospitals in China, they were all stored at − 80 °C.
All the isolates were sub-cultured onto Sabouraud dex￾trose agar medium at 25 °C for 48~72 h and identified
by VITEK 2 Compact (bioMérieux SA, France). Each
isolate was also inoculated on canavanine-glycine￾bromthymol blue (CGB) agar [23] at 25 °C for 24~120 h,
The isolates which showed blue pigmentation on CGB
agar were then subjected to further identification.
Identification by MALDI-TOF MS
Isolates were re-identified and analyzed by MALDI-TOF
MS (Bruker, Daltonik, Bremen, Germany). Briefly, one
single colony was smeared directly on the MALDI-TOF
MS analysis plate and formic acid was added. After 3~5
min, matrix was added and the plate was put into the
MALDI-TOF MS instrument with MALDI Biotyper
software 3.0 (Bruker Daltonik GmbH) for species

identification and dendrogram analysis. Two strains of
C.neoformans were included as outgroup control.
Analysis by multilocus sequence typing (MLST)
Genomic DNA of each isolate identified as C. gattii was
then extracted using the TianGen® TIANamp Yeast
DNA Kit (Tiangen Biotech Beijing CO., LTD, China)
complying with the manufacturer’s instruction, seven
genes of unlinked loci were amplified, including six
housekeeping genes (CAP59, GPD1, LAC1, PLB1,
SOD1, URA5) and one non-coding region gene (IGS1)
[24], bi-directional sequencing for each gene was then
carried out, sequence comparison for each locus was
done according to the method described by ISHAM
Cryptococcal Working Group. Sequences were uploaded
to the MLST Database for the C.neoformans/C.gattii
species complex (http://mlst.mycologylab.org) one by
one. A sequence type (ST) number and seven allele type
(AT) numbers were given to each isolate. New AT and
ST number will be assigned for new sequence. To differ￾entiate VGII subtypes, twelve unlinked genes (SXI1α,
TEF1, FTR1, CBP1, ICL1, HOG1, TOR1, STE7, TRR1,
FHB1, RAS1, PAK1) were also amplified and sequenced
according to the method of Fraser et al. [25], they were
analyzed and compared with Vancouver Island strains of
R265 and R272.
Antifungal susceptibility test of C. gattii isolates
Antifungal susceptibility test was carried out by both
ATB fungus 3 (bioMérieux SA, France) and Yeast one
(Trek Diagnostic Systems Ltd., UK) following their in￾structions. Candida krusei ATCC 6258 and Candida
parapsilosis ATCC 22019 were used for quality control.
Clinical information of patients
Under authorization of Medical Record Department,
Clinical information of patients infected by C. gattii was
reviewed retrospectively, including age, sex, underlying
diseases, symptoms, imaging findings, laboratory exami￾nations and antifungal therapy.
Analysis of differential proteins
According to the regional distribution and the integrity
of clinical data of the strains, six strains (4 of VGI and 2
of VGII) of C. gattii were selected for proteome analysis.
All the isolates were sub-cultured onto Sabouraud dex￾trose agar medium, incubated at 25 °C for 48~72 h , the
proteins were extracted from the strains, The protein
concentration was 0.5 μg/μl, after being separated by
SDS-PAGE electrophoresis (One-dimensional), the pro￾teins were hydrolyzed and analyzed. Original mass
spectrum files of 6 strains were imported into Maxquatt
software (version 1.3.0.5) for analysis. The database
source was for C.gattii. in Uniprot (http://www.
geneontology.org/). Plus or minus 15 ppm of polypeptide
molecular weight, or missing 2 cutting sites were set as
Maxquatt parameters, false discovery rate (FDR) for
polypeptide identification was set as 0.01. A standard of
p < 0.05 and 2-fold expression were considered as differ￾ent proteins. The enrichment and pathway analysis was
carried out by using the GO plot package of R language
and KEGG online tool (https://david.ncifcrf.gov/, http://
www.kegg.jp/kegg/pathway.html). The bubble diagram
was drawn according to the R language ggplot2 package.
