Abstract
Background: The HeartMate 3 Left Ventricular Assist System (LVAS) (St. Jude Medical Inc., St Paul, MN) with full
magnetic levitation allows for wide and consistent blood flow paths and an artificial pulse designed for enhanced
hemocompatibility. The HeartMate 3 received market approval in the European Union in 2015 following completion
of a multicenter study. After reaching the 6-month study endpoint, patients continue to be followed for 2 years
with the 1-year results presented herein.
Methods: A prospective, non-randomized study included adults with advanced heart failure and ejection fraction
(EF) ≤ 25%, cardiac index (CI) ≤ 2.2 L/min/m2 while not on inotropes, or inotrope dependent, or on optimal medical
management for 45/60 days.
Results: Fifty patients—54% bridge to transplant (BTT) and 46% destination therapy (DT)—were enrolled and
implanted with the HeartMate 3. At baseline, 92% of the patients were INTERMACS profiles 2–4, with cardiac index
1.8 + 0.5 L/min/m2 and 58% were supported with inotropes. At 1 year, 74% of the patients remain on support, 18%
expired, 6% transplanted, and 2% explanted. The adverse events include 12% gastrointestinal bleeding, 16%
driveline infections, 18% strokes, and 2% outflow graft thrombosis. There was no hemolysis, pump thrombosis or
pump malfunction through 1 year. The six-minute walk test distance increased from a mean of 273 m to 371 m
(P <0.0001). EQ-5D quality-of-life score increased from a mean of 52.7 to 70.8 (P = 0.0006).
Conclusions: The 1-year HeartMate 3 LVAS results show survival and adverse-event profile are similar to other
approved devices, with no pump thrombosis or pump failure. Patient’s functional status and quality of life
significantly improved over time.

Background
Circulatory support with a continuous-flow left ventricu￾lar assist device (CF-LVAD) restores circulation, pre￾serves organ function, improves functional status and
quality of life, and extends survival for patients with
refractory advanced stage heart failure [1–6]. Limitations
of current CF-LVAD technology is primarily the re￾sult of untoward hematologic responses to the de￾vice’s artificial materials and the high shear forces
imparted on blood components by the pump [7].
Hemolysis, platelet activation, and cleaving of von
Willebrand factor multimeres often occur during CF￾LVAD support and are important contributing factors
to thrombosis, stroke, and gastrointestinal (GI) blee￾ding—adverse events that are the primary limitations
of CF-LVAD support [8]. Advancing outcomes of CF￾LVAD-supported patients entails novel designs that
optimize the blood-biomaterial interface and produce
blood flow with low shear force for nominal effects
on blood components.
The HeartMate 3 Left Ventricular Assist System
(LVAS) (St. Jude Medical Inc., St. Paul, MN) was
designed for enhanced hemocompatibility by the inte￾gration of a fully magnetically levitated rotor for friction￾less movement, wide blood flow gaps through the pump
for lower shear stress, and textured blood-contacting
inner and outer surfaces for establishing a tissue inter￾face with blood [9, 10]. An artificial pulse allows for
more complete washing of pump surfaces eliminating
stasis as a cause of pump thrombosis and possibly other
clinical benefits related to the pulse pressure. Clinical
studies evaluating the HeartMate 3 were initiated in June
of 2014 at 10 centers in Europe, Australia, Canada, and
Kazakhstan [11]. Fifty patients who met the criteria for
refractory advanced stage heart failure received the
HeartMate 3 in a trial designed to include both bridge to
transplant and destination therapy patients [10]. Results
of the study demonstrated the performance goal at the
6-month study endpoint was exceeded, with 92% of
patients alive with no instances of hemolysis, pump
thrombosis or pump failure. Market approval in the
European Union was obtained on October 8, 2015. The
purpose of this report is to present the 1 year results of
the study, and planned follow-up of 2-years for this
study group is ongoing [10].
Methods
The clinical trial protocol, including patient criteria
for enrollment, study endpoints, HeartMate 3 LVAS
description, and statistical methods have been previ￾ously published [10]. In brief, this single-arm, pro￾spective, nonrandomized clinical trial had a primary
endpoint of survival at 6 months compared with a
performance goal of 88% derived using data from
matched subjects in the INTERMACS (Interagency
Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Sup￾port) registry. Patients with ongoing HeartMate 3
support after 6-months will be followed for 24 months.
Patients were adults with New York Heart Asso￾ciation (NYHA) class IIIB or IV, or American College
of Cardiology/American Heart Association Stage D
heart failure, EF < 25%, CI < 2.2 L/min/m2 without
inotropes, or were inotrope-dependent on optimal med￾ical management, or listed for heart transplant. All
patients meeting the study criteria were included re￾gardless of the indication for LVAS support: BTT and
DT. Follow-up assessments include quality of life
(QOL; European Quality of Life Questionnaire 5 level);
functional status (six-minute walk test, NYHA func￾tional class); adverse event rates; incidence of device
malfunction, reoperation, rehospitalization, and survival
free of debilitating stroke (modified Rankin Score > 3).
The INTERMACS adverse event definitions were used
during the trial [12].
Results
Patients
The 50 patients were enrolled in this clinical trial
from June 2014 to November 2014, with the 6-
month follow-up completed on May 26, 2015, and
the 1-year follow-up completed on November 26,
2015. Details of the study design and results from
the first 6 months have been previously reported
(10). Table 1 lists the key demographic parameters at
the time of implantation for the study group. The
indication for LVAS support was nearly equally dis￾tributed between BTT (54%) and DT (46%). There
were no patients classified as INTERMACS profile 1
or 7, while the majority of patients were either
profile 3 (42%) or 4 (40%).

Outcomes at 1 year
At the 1-year follow-up, 37 (74%) patients had ongoing
support. Three patients (6%) underwent transplant fol￾lowing 50, 101, and 231 days of support, with all alive
and well at follow-up. The Kaplan-Meier survival at the
12-month time point was 81 ± 6% (Fig. 1). One patient
(2%) had the device explanted on support day 185 due
to sepsis and an abdominal wall abscess. There were a
total of 9 deaths (18%): 4 in the first 6-months and 5 in
the second 6-month follow-up time. The causes of
deaths in the first 6-months were anaphylaxis, cardiac
arrest, suicide and renal failure [10]. Deaths occurring
during months 6 to 12 were caused by Merkel Cell
carcinoma (day 203), ischemic stroke (day 212), intra￾cerebral bleeding with international normalized ratio
(INR) > 6 (day 232), and 2 cases of chronic infection with
multiple organ failure (days 277 and 319).
Forty-three (86%) patients were discharged from the
hospital with LVAS support. Seven patients were not dis￾charged due to death during the index hospitalization
(5) and heart transplantation (2). Twenty-eight patients
(56%) had a total 66 readmissions to the hospital due to
various adverse events (51; 77%), routine or scheduled
testing (5), low flow alarm (2), driveline infection (1),
ICD therapy (1), epistaxis (1), automobile accident
(1), broken arm from fall (1), transplant evaluation
(1), anticoagulation adjustment (1), and suspected device
malfunction (1).
Adverse events
Adverse events are presented in Table 2 by the interval
of occurrence (days 0 to 180 or days 181 to 365) and the
total for the 1-year follow-up. Bleeding and infection
were the predominate events overall, occurring in 44%
and 36% of patients, respectively. Bleeding events requir￾ing reoperation or blood transfusion were observed
mostly early after implantation. The overall bleeding
event rate declined from 38% in the first 6 months to
18% in the second 6-month period. The total number of
patients with GI bleeding was 6 (12%), with only 2
patients (5%) experiencing this event during the second
6 months of support. The freedom from GI bleeding
event was 89.6% at 6 months and 87.1% at 1 year (Fig. 2).
The number of total infection events were fewer during
the second 6 months (28 vs 10), with 3 (7%) having
driveline infection and 2 (5%) with sepsis.
Stroke events occurred in 6 (12%) patients in the first
6-months and in 3 (6%) patients in the second 6 months.
The freedom from stroke was 87.7% at 6 months and
81.2% at 1-year (Fig. 3). Of those patients with stroke in
the second 6 months, one patient experienced ischemic
stroke with a modified Rankin Score (MRS) > 3 on sup￾port day 209 following rapid onset of sepsis; computed
tomography scan identified outflow thrombosis, which
embolized during transport to the operating room. Two
patients had hemorrhagic strokes, with MRS > 3: one on
support day 231 that was associated with an INR > 6,
and another on day 309 that was associated with a
chronic driveline infection.
During the 1-year follow-up time, there were no
incidences of hemolysis, pump thrombosis or pump mal￾function. Other neurologic events and right heart failure
were not observed in the second 6-month follow-up.
Functional status and quality of life
Patients who were able to complete the six-minute walk
test before implantation and at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months
showed a statistically significant improvement in walk
distance at each interval (Fig. 4). At 1 year, the median
distance walked was 383 m, which was an improvement
of 219 m over the baseline values. The NYHA class
was significantly improved (p <0.0001), with 89% of
patients being classified as I or II at 1-year time point
compared to 0% prior to implant (Fig. 5). Patient as￾sessment of their QOL by the EuroQol visual analog
score showed significant improvement at 3, 6, and
12 months (p <0.001) (Fig. 6).
Discussion
This follow-up evaluation of heart failure patients
supported by the HeartMate 3 for BTT and DT indicates
sustained improvement in physical functioning and
QOL out to 1 year. Adverse event rates tended to be
lower in the second 6 months and there were no cases
of hemolysis, pump thrombosis, or pump failure in the
year of support. These results demonstrate comparable
reliability and safety of the HeartMate 3 at 1 year of
support as compared with currently available CF-LVADs.
The occurrence of GI bleeding during LVAS sup￾port is an important concern because of the need for
rehospitalization and the considerable increase in the Fig. 1 Kaplan-Meier survival to 1-year after implantation

cost of care. The reported rates of GI bleeding range from
15%[13] to as high as 40%,[14] with the majority of studies
reporting rates in the range of 20–30% [15–20]. Loss of
von Willebrand multimers due to high shear stress and
decreased arterial pulsatility are believed to be the
principle characteristics of CF-LVADs that cause GI
bleeding [21–24]. The 1-year rate of GI bleeding in this
study was 12%, with only 5% occurring during the second
half of the year. This lower rate of GI bleeding appears to
be due to better preservation of von Willebrand multi￾meres that has been observed in patients supported by the
HeartMate 3 [25].

Pump thrombosis has become a considerable concern
in recent years due to an increase in incidence and the
considerable morbidity associated with the event [26, 27].
Most patients survive this event by undergoing device
exchange, or in a few cases thrombolytic therapy is
successful. Pump exchange can be performed safely;
however, there is some mortality due to major surgery and
the hospital time increases cost considerably [28–31]. The
rate of pump thrombosis for patients implanted with the
HeartMate II LVAS (St. Jude Medical Inc., St. Paul MN) is
between 6% and 12% at one year and for the HeartWare
HVAD (HeartWare International Inc., Framingham, MA),
the reported rate is 8% [26, 32, 33]. An important observa￾tion from this relatively small study is that there were no
cases of HeartMate 3 pump thrombosis, and no pump
failures, and thus no patients required pump exchange.
The overall rate of stroke at 18%, with near equal
distribution between ischemic (10%) and hemorrhagic
(8%) stroke, was not expected given the absence of
hemolysis and pump thrombosis indicating that these
events may be related other factors including blood
pressure and other variables. In comparison, in recent
publications the stroke rate for patients implanted with
the HeartMate II LVAS (St. Jude Medical Inc., St. Paul MN)
is between 10.9% and 12.1% (6 month and 2 year follow-up
rate, respectively) [34, 35] and for the HeartWare HVAD
(HeartWare International Inc., Framingham, MA), the
2 year follow-up reported rate is 29.7% [35]. Six (12%) of

the stroke events occurred within the first 6 months and 3
(7%) occurred in the second half of the follow-up time.
Factors associated with the stroke events were procedural
(3), infection (3), INR > 6 (1), multiple organ failure (1), and
1 unidentified. Strokes associated with procedures were 1)
difficulty placing the inflow conduit, 2) anaphylaxis from
contrast media for lung CT scan, 3) following transcather
aortic valve placement [10]. All patients were receiving
warfarin anticoagulation, with a target INR range of 2.0–
3.0, and aspirin 81–100 mg daily. Procedural-related stroke
events are controllable and infection reduction efforts are
continuous. Along with refined anticoagulation protocols
that should be revealed in ongoing studies, there should be
optimism that stroke events will decline in the future.
Other neurologic events encountered were minimal, with 2
(4%) transient ischemic attacks (TIA) and 2 (4%) seizures;
all which occurred within the first 6 months.
The 30-day, 6-month, and 12-month survival rates for
this cohort were 98, 92, and 81%, respectively. Careful
consideration must be given when comparing these
results to other clinical studies with durable CF-LVADs
because of the mix of BTT and DT indications. The 1-
year survival rate for BTT studies is 85%[3–5]; for DT,
the rate is 74% [36]. In a recent report of a study involv￾ing all patients receiving durable support (N = 5942)
from the International Society for Heart and Lung
Transplantation Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Sup￾port (IMACS) registry, the 6-month and 1-year survival

rates were 86 and 80%, respectively [37]. Although any
comparison to other studies is imprecise, the survival
rates for this study are similar to other experiences.
Limitations
The foremost limitations of this study was the non￾randomized and non-controlled design and the relatively
small number of patients in the study. Comparison to
other clinical studies is not equivalent due to the mix of
BTT and DT indications. With implantations at 10
different centers and in different parts of the world,
patient care practices may vary by institutional prefer￾ences. All sites participating in the trial received the
same training and support, and each site had similar
longstanding experience with mechanical circulatory
support systems.
Conclusions
The survival rate is acceptable in this first in human
series of patients with the HeartMate 3 LVAS. Major
complications such as bleeding, infection, stroke, and
right heart failure declined in the second 6 months of
follow-up. Improvements in NYHA class, six-minute
walk distance, and QOL measures demonstrate excellent
circulatory support.[38] The absence of hemolysis and
pump thrombosis for the 1-year follow-up is encour￾aging. The results observed in this study mirror that of a
large randomized clinical trial just recently completed in
the United States [34, 39]. In this trial that compared the
HeartMate II and the HeartMate 3 in an “all-comers”
design, reoperation due to pump thrombosis favored the
new centrifugal flow HeartMate 3. Both HeartMate 3
studies indicate that there appears to be enhanced dur￾ability and hemocompatibility for long-term support
with the HeartMate 3.
