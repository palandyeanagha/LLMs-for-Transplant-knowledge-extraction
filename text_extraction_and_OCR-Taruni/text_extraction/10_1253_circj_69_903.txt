ntimal thickening is considered to be an early phase of
atherosclerosis;1–5 in the coronary artery it is related
to coronary spasm and is of prognostic importance in
patients after cardiac transplantation.6,7 Evaluation of intimal
thickening of the coronary artery is thought to be important
clinically and recent advancements in intravascular ultra￾sound (IVUS) have enabled pathological evaluation of the
wall structure of the coronary artery.8–15 However, intimal
thickening is indirectly evaluated as the intima – media
thickness (IMT) by IVUS because the boundary of the
intima and media cannot be distinguished completely by
this method.16 Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a
new imaging method17–22 with a resolution of approximate￾ly 10–20μm, which is approximately 10-fold greater than
that of IVUS.23 OCT can easily identify the internal elastic
laminae, which cannot be identified by IVUS.18,19 We thus
hypothesized that OCT could enable more accurate mea￾surement of the IMT and the intimal thickness than IVUS,
so the aim of the present study was to test these hypotheses.
Methods
We examined 54 randomly selected segments from 54
coronary arteries from 18 consecutive cadavers (10 males,
8 females; mean age 72±6 years). The cause of death was
leukemia (n=3), lung cancer (n=3), acute myocardial in￾farction (n=2), pulmonary embolism (n=2), intracranial
hemorrhage (n=2), liver cirrhosis (n=2), pneumonia (n=2),

and trauma (n=2). The study protocol was approved by the
ethics committee of Kawasaki Medical School, and written
informed consent was obtained from each family. An ap￾proximate 5-cm length of the proximal site of the 3 major
coronary arteries, the left anterior descending coronary
artery, left circumflex artery, and right coronary artery,
were obtained from cadavers at autopsy within 3 h of death.
The surrounding soft tissue was dissected from each speci￾men. Small arterial perforators and the branches were tied
off with sutures, and the distal end of the artery was
occluded with a large cork. A 7F sheath was sewn into the
proximal end of the artery to complete the closed system.
Phosphate-buffered saline (154 mmol/L NaCl, 10 mmol/L
NaH2PO4, pH 7.4), which was kept at 37°C, was infused
through the side arm of the sheath. The pressure inside the
coronary artery was maintained at a physiological level
(60–80 mmHg) with a sphygmomanometer connected to
the infusion.
OCT and IVUS Images
An intravascular OCT catheter (ImageWire®, LightLab
Imaging, Westford, MA, USA) and IVUS catheter (Atlantis
SR Pro® 2.5F, 40-MHz, Boston Scientific, Natick, MA,
USA) were inserted through the diaphragm of the sheath.
Serial OCT and IVUS images were obtained using an auto￾matic pullback device at a rate of 0.5 mm/s. The OCT
images were processed and analyzed using proprietary
software from LightLab Imaging, Inc and the IVUS images
were exported to commercially available image processing
software (Netra 3D IVUS system, ScImage) for off-line
analysis. Using this software, images at 400-μm intervals
from the distal end of the vessel were selected and used for
analysis.

Background Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a new imaging method. With a resolution of approxi￾mately 10–20μm, which is approximately 10-fold higher than that of intravascular ultrasound (IVUS).
Methods and Results This study compared the coronary intima – media thickness (IMT) and the intimal thick￾ness of 54 coronary arterial segments evaluated by histological examination with the results of OCT and IVUS.
There was better agreement in IMT between OCT and histological examination than between IVUS and histo￾logical examination (r=0.95, p<0.001, mean difference =–0.01±0.07 mm for OCT; r=0.88, p<0.001, mean differ￾ence =–0.03±0.10 mm for IVUS). There was good agreement in the intimal thickness between OCT and histo￾logical examination (r=0.98, p<0.001, mean difference =0.01±0.04 mm).
Conclusions IMT could be measured more accurately by OCT than IVUS. In addition, the intimal thickness
could be evaluated by OCT and correlated well with the histological examination. (Circ J 2005; 69: 903 – 907)

Histological Examination
After recording the OCT and IVUS images, each coro￾nary artery was pressure perfusion-fixed in 10% neutral
buffered formalin. After fixation for 48 h, samples were
processed for standard paraffin embedding. Two series of
sections of 4μm in thickness were cut at 400-μm intervals
from the coronary arteries and stained with hematoxylin –
eosin and elastica van Gieson stains.
Measurements From the Images and Corresponding 
Histology
In the OCT images, the IMT was defined as the distance
from the internal border of the signal-rich layer nearest the
lumen to the outer border of the signal-poor middle layer,
as previously reported.18,19 In the IVUS images, IMT was
identified as the distance from the lumen – intimal border 
to the echo-reflective adventitial border.16,24,25 The IMT and
luminal area of the histological sections obtained from the
portion imaged by OCT and IVUS were compared with
those measured from the images. In the OCT images, the
intima was identified as the signal-rich layer nearest the
lumen. Its thickness was measured and compared with the
histological value. The borders of the IMT, luminal area and
intima were drawn manually. Each set of OCT images was
analyzed by 2 independent observers and their measure￾ments were compared to determine the interobserver varia￾bility. Blind analyses were repeated by the first observer
after an interval of at least 4 weeks and these measurements
were compared to determine the intraobserver variability.
Statistical Analysis
Comparison of each parameter was made using linear re￾gression and the Bland-Altman test.26 The intra- and inter￾observer agreement (reproducibility) was assessed by
determining the mean and SD of the between-observation
and between-observer differences, respectively. Values of
p<0.05 were considered statistically significant.
Results
Measurement of Luminal Area and IMT
There was good correlation of the luminal area between
both OCT and IVUS and the histological examination (y=
0.99x+0.24, r=0.97, p<0.001; and y=0.94x+0.64, r=0.96,
p<0.001, respectively). The histological measurement of
the IMT ranged from 0.21 to 1.20 mm (mean 0.56). The
OCT images had good contrast of the layers of the vessel
wall, which clearly delineated the intima and media
(Figs 1,2). There was better agreement on the IMT between
OCT and histological examination than between IVUS and
histology (y=0.87x+0.08, r=0.95, p<0.001, mean differ￾ence =–0.01±0.07 mm for OCT; y=0.85x+0.11, r=0.88,
p<0.001, mean difference =–0.03±0.10 mm for IVUS)
(Figs 3,4).
Measurement of the Intimal Thickness
The intimal thickness measured by histology ranged
from 0.10 to 0.89 mm (mean 0.29). The intimal thickness
could be measured on all OCT images, but could not be
identified by IVUS. There was good correlation of the in￾Fig 1. Correlation between (A) optical coherence tomography image (OCT), (B) intravascular ultrasound image (IVUS)
and (C) histological examination (elastica van Gieson stain) of a human coronary artery. The OCT image demonstrates

Discussion
The IMT can be measured more accurately by OCT than
by IVUS, and the intimal thickness also can be evaluated
by this technique and correlates well with histological
examination results. To the best of our knowledge, we are
the first to evaluate intimal thickness by OCT and compare
the IMT measured from histological sections with the
corresponding IVUS and OCT images.
One of the greatest advantages of OCT as an imaging
modality is its resolution compared with IVUS. In the pres￾ent study, OCT showed qualitatively superior delineation
of the vessel wall structure compared with IVUS. The reso￾lution of the current OCT system was 10–20μm and that of
the 40-MHz IVUS system was 100μm. In addition, an
ultrasound reflection occurs whenever there is an abrupt
change in acoustic impedance (eg, at a tissue interface).
Normally, 2 strong acoustic interfaces are visualized by
ultrasound: the leading edge of the intima (at the interface
between the lumen and the endothelium) and the outer
border of the media (at the junction of the media and the
external elastic laminae). Accordingly, ultrasound tech￾niques measure intimal thickness from the intimal leading
edge to the external elastic membrane, thus including the
media24 and making it difficult to identify only the intimal
thickness, and so many studies use the IMT instead.3,4,27,28
That is the reason why we did not measure the intimal
thickness by IVUS. On the other hand, using OCT, precise
measurement of not only the IMT, but also the intimal
thickness was possible. In addition, there were only small
inter- and intraobserver differences in the OCT measure￾ments. Evaluation of the IMT of the coronary artery is
clearly important in the clinical situation3–8,24,25,27–29 and
thus our result has important clinical implications for the
use of OCT to determine the intima thickness or IMT
precisely in vivo. Moreno et al suggested that the intima￾media interface and adventitial changes may play a role in
the natural history of complex atherosclerotic lesions,30 so
certain characteristics of the atherosclerotic lesion may
have important implications for the prognosis of patients
with coronary artery disease. In the near future, OCT may
be used to monitor the structural changes that occur with
regression of atherosclerotic lesions after genetic or phar￾macological intervention.
Study Limitations
Measurements during OCT, IVUS and the histological
examination were carried out strictly on corresponding
sites at the same distance from the side branches used as
anatomical landmarks. Any discrepancy related to differ￾ences in the measurement position for OCT, IVUS and his￾tological examination might influence the results. Howev￾er, such a discrepancy would affect not only the correlation
between OCT and histological examination, but also that
between IVUS and histological examination. Thus, correla￾tions among OCT, IVUS and histological examination
similar to the present study could be obtained if the mea￾surements are performed strictly on corresponding sites. If
we used a specific marker such as metal pin located outside
vessel, we could examine the same point more exactly.
OCT and IVUS examinations overestimated the results
compared with histological examination (correlation co￾efficient <1.0), which might be due to a shrinkage artifact
in the processing of the histological specimens, despite the
use of pressure perfusion-fixation. If OCT and IVUS mea￾surements were repeated after fixation, better correlation
between OCT and histological examination, or IVUS and
histological examination might be obtained. However, it
has been reported that in vessels with <50% luminal cross￾sectional narrowing, histological fixation and processing
change the size of the luminal cross-sectional area but not
the absolute wall area.31 Therefore, the effect of histological
fixation and processing is less significant in the measure￾ment of IMT or intimal thickness. Plaque area and plaque
volume can be measured by IVUS,32,33 but it was difficult to
measure a large area of plaque or plaque volume by OCT
because the maximum depth of penetration of the OCT
catheter is approximately 2.0 mm from the center of the
catheter. The limited penetration depth in OCT could pose
a problem. The current capabilities of OCT are thought to
be well suited for the identification and study of plaques in
which the relevant morphologic features are primarily
localized within 500μm of the luminal surface. We ana￾lyzed coronary arteries from cadavers. In vivo, heart motion
artifacts might represent a potential limitation to OCT.
Conclusions
IMT could be measured more accurately by OCT than by
IVUS. In addition, the intimal thickness could be evaluated
by OCT and correlated well with the histological examina￾tion results.
