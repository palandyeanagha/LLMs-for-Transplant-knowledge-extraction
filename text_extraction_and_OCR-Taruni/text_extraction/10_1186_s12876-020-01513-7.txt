Abstract
Gastric varices are encountered less frequently than esophageal varices. Nonetheless, gastric variceal bleeding is 
more severe and associated with worse outcomes. Conventionally, gastric varices have been described based on the 
location and extent and endoscopic treatments offered based on these descriptions. With improved understanding 
of portal hypertension and the dynamic physiology of collateral circulation, gastric variceal classification has been 
refined to include inflow and outflow based hemodynamic pathways. These have led to an improvement in the man￾agement of gastric variceal disease through newer modalities of treatment such as endoscopic ultrasound-guided 
glue-coiling combination therapy and the emergence of highly effective endovascular treatments such as shunt and 
variceal complex embolization with or without transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) placement in 
patients who are deemed ‘difficult’ to manage the traditional way. Furthermore, the decisions regarding TIPS and addi￾tional endovascular procedures in patients with gastric variceal bleeding have changed after the emergence of ‘portal 
hypertension theories’ of proximity, throughput, and recruitment. The hemodynamic classification, grounded on 
novel theories and its cognizance, can help in identifying patients at baseline, in whom conventional treatment could 
fail. In this exhaustive review, we discuss the conventional and hemodynamic diagnosis of gastric varices concern￾ing new classifications; explore and illustrate new ‘portal hypertension theories’ of gastric variceal disease and corre￾sponding management and shed light on current evidence-based treatments through a ‘new’ algorithmic approach, 
established on hemodynamic physiology of gastric varices.

Disease definition and epidemiology
Portal hypertension (PH) is a syndrome characterized 
by the formation of portosystemic collaterals in the 
presence or absence of cirrhosis. The cardinal feature 
of PH is the formation of varices, which are dilated pre￾existing or newly formed portosystemic venous chan￾nels, commonly found in esophageal and gastric regions 
that at risk for gastrointestinal bleeding. The prevalence 
of varices in cirrhosis can range from 40% in patients 
with Child–Pugh class A to approximately 85% in those 
in Child–Pugh class C [1, 2]. Gastric varices (GV; com￾monly classified using the Sarin system) are less com￾mon than esophageal varices with an incidence between 
2 and 20%. As a general rule, GV is noted in one out of 
every five patients with cirrhosis [3]. The cumulative risk 
of bleeding from GVs 16%, 36%, and 44% at one, three, 
and five years follow up respectively, in patients without 
bleeding at diagnosis. Another large study showed that 
the cumulative bleeding was 4.8%, 19.9%, and 23.2%, 
respectively [3, 4]. Among GV, most common is Type 1

gastroesophageal varices (GOV), representing 70% of 
all GV, followed by Type 2 GOV in 21%.The highest risk 
of bleeding is associated with Type 1 IGV followed by 
Type 2 GOV. Acute variceal bleeding is a severe compli￾cation of cirrhosis that can lead to death in one-third of 
affected patients at 6  weeks. Even though only 10–30% 
of variceal bleeds are related to GV, it is associated with 
higher transfusion requirements, uncontrolled bleeding, 
rebleeding, and death. GVs bleed less frequently than 
esophageal varices but tend to bleed more severely. The 
severity of PH, as measured by the hepatic venous pres￾sure gradient (HVPG), is beneficial in determining the 
risk of bleeding, rebleeding, and uncontrolled bleeding 
from esophageal varices. However, in GVs, the risk of 
bleeding is not entirely dependent on the degree of PH, 
but more related to the size of varices, the wall tension, 
and presence of red color signs over varix [5, 6]. A thor￾ough understanding of the anatomy and pathophysiology 
of pertinent collateral pathways is required to decide on 
the best possible treatment option(s) for bleeding from 
GVs, beyond current recommendations.
Diagnosis
Endoscopic evaluation‑based diagnosis and classification
Stadelmann, in 1913 described the formation of GVs in 
association with PH. Esophago-gastro-duodenoscopy, 
the gold standard test for diagnosing gastroesopha￾geal varices classifies them according to size as small 
(< 5 mm) or large (> 5 mm) [7]. Endoscopic ultrasonog￾raphy (EUS) can additionally assess collateral path￾way anatomy and identify of perforating veins which 
improves treatment response monitoring in real-time 
[5, 7, 8]. Nonetheless, EUS is not recommended as 
the primary tool for assessment due to limited avail￾ability and need for expertise. Capsule endoscopy in 
grading and diagnosis of esophageal and GV has an 
accuracy of 90% with pooled sensitivity and specific￾ity of 83% and 85%, respectively [9, 10]. However, it is 
limited to patients unwilling for conventional inva￾sive procedures. Liver stiffness < 20  kPa along with 
platelet count of > 150,000 per microliter is associated 
with < 5% chance of having high-risk varices. How￾ever, this non-invasive measurement is not validated 
in GVs [11]. Initially, GV was classified into F1—mild, 
F2—moderate and F3—severe, ‘forms’ (Choi classifica￾tion) and after that into those associated with splenic 
vein thrombosis and those associated with cirrhosis or 
its absence thereof. Hoskins and Johnson in 1988 pro￾vided the first full descriptive classification of GV, into 
three types, based on the relation and extension of GV 
with the esophagus. Hashizume based variceal descrip￾tions on the underlying vascular anatomy and presence 
of red color signs. Sarin classification was based on the 
location that aid in the choice of therapy. The Sarin GV 
classification is the most commonly followed, which is 
also endorsed by the Baveno [3, 6, 7]. Multiple other 
systems for describing GV came into being, which are 
of historical importance. These include the Iwase and 
Arakawa classifications, the Japanese Society for Portal 
Hypertension (JSPH) modification of the Hashizume 
classification, and the Italian Endoscopic Classification. 
Another simple classification differentiates GV into 
primary and secondary, the latter occurring after band 
ligation and eradication of esophageal varices (Addi￾tional file 1: Table 1) [5, 7, 8].
The relevance of collateral pathway anatomy in gastric 
varices
The GVs are generally described and therapeutic deci￾sions made based on their location and relationship with 
esophageal varices. Understanding the complex GV sys￾tem is important in deciding on therapeutic options 
beyond endoscopic interventions. In general, via hepatof￾ugal pathways, GV drain into the systemic circulation 
through two types of collateral systems. These are the 
gastroesophageal system, between the left gastric vein 
and the azygous vein and the gastrophrenic system 
between the gastric veins in the posterosuperior gastric 
wall; and left inferior phrenic vein at the gastrophrenic 
ligament near the bare area of the stomach. In isolated 
splenic vein thrombosis, the collateral circulation path￾ways form in hepatopetal manner [8].
The Type 1 GOV (of Sarin classification) drains 
through the esophageal and paraesophageal collateral 
veins; Type 2 GOV through inferior phrenic and esopha￾geal veins; Type 1 IGV through left inferior phrenic vein 
and Type 2 IGV, in sinistral PH, through gastric veins. 
The afferent vein for Type 1 GOV is the anterior left gas￾tric vein while for Type 2 GOV, it is the short gastric and 
posterior gastric veins, while in both, efferent are esoph￾ageal and paraesophageal veins. In IGV, the afferent is 
a gastric or splenorenal shunt and the inferior phrenic 
vein which terminate in the inferior vena cava [7, 12]. 
The GV also drains into the splenorenal shunt through 
the gonadal vein, or the gastrocaval shunt into the infe￾rior vena cava through the inferior phrenic or pericardio￾phrenic vein. IGVs drain through hypertrophied inferior 
phrenic vein and left renal vein at the left adrenal vein in 
85% [12, 13]. These detailed collateral and portosystemic 
shunt descriptions paved way for hemodynamic clas￾sifications that provided deeper anatomical insights on 
which interventional radiology-based management deci￾sions for endoscopically difficult to control bleeding may 
be adeptly chosen, a cognizance lacking in the original, 
standard classification systems (Fig. 1).

Cross‑sectional imaging‑based evaluation of the gastric 
variceal complex
Spontaneous portosystemic shunts (SPSS) are large col￾laterals that develop between the portal and systemic 
venous circulation that hypertrophy and enlarge to 
accommodate high blood volume and flow with increas￾ing severity of PH. These can be divided into left and 
right-sided or central shunts. Left-sided shunts are those 
that are present to the left of midline or the left of the 
splenic confluence and mesenteric veins. The most com￾mon left-sided shunt is the gastrorenal shunt, which is 
present in 10% of patients with PH but is notable in 85% 
with GVs [14, 15].
The gastric variceal system consists of the gastrore￾nal shunt, the central part that is gastric varix proper, 
and the associated afferent portal venous collateral 
feeder vessels. The variceal complex consists of the 
afferent limb (portal inflow), a central portion (varix 
proper), and an efferent limb (systemic outflow). The 
portal inflow feeder vessels do not directly communi￾cate with gastric varix proper and take part in the for￾mation of varices outside the gastric wall, called para/
extra-gastric or false GV. True gastric varix is the intra￾gastric submucosal portion that bleeds into the lumen. 
Intragastric and the para-gastric varices together form 
the central portion of the gastric variceal complex. The 
extra-gastric and intragastric components may commu￾nicate with each other through a single or multiple per￾forator vein(s). The dominance anatomy of the portal 
inflow vessels is of great importance. In some patients, 
the dominant afferent vessel is the coronary or left 
gastric vein, while in others, it is the posterior gastric 
vein. In a highly complex gastric variceal system, triple 
dominance can be noted with multiple feeder systems 
(afferent limbs). When the short gastric veins become 
dominant afferent vessels in GV formation (usually 
in splenic or PV thrombosis), the variceal complex 
extends over the fundus, body, cardia, antrum and gas￾tric outlets. This corresponds to the ‘diffuse-type’ of GV 
as per Iwase and Arakawa classification and which is 
absent from the Sarin classification [15, 16]. Verma and 
colleagues recently reported on the twenty-year experi￾ence of diagnosis and treatment of GV at a large ter￾tiary university in which the authors described Type 3 
GOV (esophageal varices with gastric varices extending 
over body, antrum, and pylorus), in 10.5% of patients, 
previously described by Iwase and Arakawa [17] The 
efferent or outflow from the gastric varix proper can be 
as simple as a single gastrorenal shunt or may become 
complicated with multiple outflow channels due to the 
involvement of inferior phrenic or pericardiophrenic 
veins. As the severity of PH increases, the shunt flow

increases, and the shunt grows and travels caudally 
and posteriorly, reaching the retroperitoneal and other 
regions sometimes undergoing duplication at the site of 
drainage. Understanding the complex anatomy of the 
GV system and associated hemodynamic classifications 
are significant in planning a multitude of managements 
for bleeding GV such as endoscopic cyanoacrylate ther￾apy only or shunt occlusion with or without variceal 
embolization, endoscopic ultrasound-guided coiling or 
transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt place￾ment [7, 8, 14–16].
Hemodynamic classification of gastric varices
The recent classification of GVs, is based on the hemo￾dynamics of afferent and efferent flow rather than loca￾tion and extent. These classifications, related to afferent 
and efferent circulation, improve therapeutic options 
beyond conventional endoscopy-based treatments 
(Figs. 2, 3).
Based on afferent/inflow hemodynamics
Kiyosue classification divides GV into three types. In 
Type 1, a single afferent vein supplies varix; in Type 2, 
multiple afferent veins supply the GV and in Type 3, sin￾gle or multiple afferent veins supply the GV through a 
shunt (indirectly). The commonest afferent vein in Type 
1 is the left gastric vein or coronary vein and in Type 
2, the left gastric vein and posterior gastric vein. In the 
Saad–Caldwell classification based on dominance, Type 
1 GV are associated with a single afferent vein (left gas￾tric vein); in Type 2, the afferent vein is the posterior 
gastric vein or the short gastric veins; in Type 3, equal 
dominance is noted between multiple afferent veins, and 
in Type 4, multiple afferent veins form in presence of 
splenic vein thrombosis (Table 1) [15, 16, 18].

(a1, a2); type 2 gastric varices by multiple afferent gastric veins (b1, b2); and type 3 (c1, c2) are supplied by single or multiple gastric veins with 
co-existent gastric veins that are directly contiguous with a shunt, but without contribution toward gastric varices. IVC inferior vena cava, PV portal

Based on efferent/outflow hemodynamics
In the Kiyosue classification of the gastric variceal system 
based on the outflow, four types are described. In Type 
A, the GVs are associated with a single draining shunt, 
most commonly the gastrorenal shunt. In Type B, drain￾age occurs through the gastrorenal shunt and associated 
multiple collateral veins. Type C GVs are associated with 
multiple shunts without additional collaterals. In Type D, 
multiple collateral veins are present without large shunts. 
In the Hirota-BORV classification, the descriptions are 
similar to Kiyosue (Type A–D) but with the addition of 
Type E, in which the gastrorenal shunt is too large for 
transvenous retrograde balloon occlusion. In such situ￾ation, an antegrade approach is more feasible for shunt 
and variceal embolization (Table 2) [15, 16].
Based on balloon occluded retrograde transvenography
Hirota classification is specifically based on real-time 
features of angiographic opacification of gastric varices 
(from grade 1–5). In Grade 1, GVs are well opacified 
without evidence of collateral circulation, while in 
Grade 5, the opacification of varices occurs minimally 
due to the presence of large shunt and rapid volume 
run-off. In the Fukuda classification, Type 1 includes 
GVs associated with the dominant left gastric vein, 
while in Type 2, the left gastric vein supplies the esoph￾ageal component of the variceal complex while the 
posterior or short gastric veins supply the gastric com￾ponent. Type 3 include both left and right feeder vein 
dominant gastric variceal complex while Type 4 is asso￾ciated with purely right-sided dominant supply. Matsu￾moto and colleagues classified GVs based on predicted 
aggravation of esophageal varices after embolization 
procedures. In Matsumoto Type 1 there is associated 
portosystemic flow in the gastrorenal shunt, and Type 
2 portosystemic shunt flow is absent. In both, subtype 
A is associated with hepatopetal flow, while subtype B 
is associated with hepatofugal flow in the left gastric 
vein. Worsening of esophageal varices is associated 
with Matsumoto Type 1B in which after shunt embo￾lization, backward flow into the left gastric vein results 
in increasing grades of esophageal varices (Additional 
file  1: Table  2) [18, 19]. Clinical significance of hemo￾dynamics (inflow and outflow) based classification and 
associated treatment of GVs during shunt occlusion 
procedures, beyond endoscopic management is shown 
in Fig. 4.

a single shunt and collateral veins, type C (c1, c2) with both gastrorenal and gastrocaval shunts and type D (d1, d2) are contiguous with multiple 
collaterals in the absence of shunt(s). IVC inferior vena cava, PV portal vein, LGV left gastric vein, SMV superior mesenteric vein, LRV left renal vein, SV

Treatment
Primary prophylaxis of gastric variceal bleeding
In patients with GVs who have not bled, similar to the 
prevention of acute variceal bleeding from esophageal 
varices, the use of nonselective beta-blockers has been 
suggested. The role of endoscopic cyanoacrylate glue 
injection and endoscopic band ligation (EBL) as options 
for primary prophylaxis in gastroesophageal varices 
remain unclear. In a study conducted from a single 
center in India, endoscopic glue injection was found to 
be associated with lower bleeding and mortality com￾pared to nonselective beta-blockers [20]. Kang et  al. 
demonstrated the long-term efficacy of prophylactic 
cyanoacrylate glue therapy in 27 patients with high-risk 
GVs with 6-months cumulative survival of 75% [21]. 
The Baveno VI consensus and American Association 
for the Study of Liver Diseases recommend the use of 
non-selective beta-blockers [22].
Bhat and colleagues studied the primary prophylaxis 
of gastric variceal bleeding using EUS guided glue injec￾tion and found that only 5% bled at 449 days follow up. 
Further studies on EUS based therapy for prevention of 
bleeding in GV are lacking [23]. In the study by Koziel 
et  al. on EUS-guided obliteration of GVs using vascular 
coils only or coils with CYA injections for primary and 
secondary prophylaxis for GV haemorrhage, techni￾cal success was 94% without serious complications [24]. 
Nonetheless, this was a small series with retrospec￾tive methodology and inherent bias. Primary TIPS is 
not recommended for prevention of GV bleeding. Bal￾loon-retrograde transvenous occlusion (BRTO) and it’s 
variant techniques such as coil-assisted retrograde trans￾venous occlusion (CARTO), plug-assisted retrograde

Kiyosue classification In Type A, shunt occlusion as the treatment of modality would suffice to 
control variceal bleeding not controlled with endoscopic therapy. In 
type B, feasibility of shunt occlusion might be less and hence transjugular 
intrahepatic portosystemic shunt placement is a better option to oblit￾erate all of the collateral pathways
In type C, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt placement along 
with shunt emobilization of large portosystemic shunts could be the best 
option in ideal candidates
In Type D, in the presence of endoscopic failure, transjugular intrahepatic 
portosystemic shunt placement could become the best option
Type A: single draining shunt
Type B: single shunt and multiple collateral veins
B1: small collateral veins
B2: medium sized collateral
B3: large collateral veins with high flow without shunt
Type C: more than one shunt present
C1: small sized second shunt that cannot be catheterized
C2: presence of second shunt large enough to be catheterized
Type D: shunt is not present and the varices drain through small collater￾als
Saad–Caldwell classification In Type D, embolization procedures may not suffice to prevent rebleed￾ing or control active bleeding due to the complex anatomy, and hence, 
transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt placement could become 
the best option for prevention of further bleeding

out of inferior phrenic, hemiazygos tributaries, and intercostals veins or 
adrenal veins may be predominant
D2: morphology similar to D1, but predominant systemic venous draining 
vein is usually 4.3 mm in diameter through unconventional systemic 
veins

In Type B, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt placement with or 
without shunt embolization can help obliterate varices
In Type C, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt placement and 
shunt embolization need to be performed for large shunts for complete 
variceal disease management

than a retrograde approach since balloon sizes may not be available and 
the shunt flow is high

transvenous occlusion (PARTO), balloon antegrade 
transvenous occlusion (BATO) and our group described 
novel techniques such as the ‘direct’ (D)-PARTO or direct 
coil-assisted antegrade transvenous occlusion (CAATO) 
are not evaluated in high-quality randomized trials for 
prevention of first gastric variceal bleeding and hence 
cannot be recommended as primary prophylaxis [25].
Management of acute gastric variceal bleeding 
and secondary prophylaxis
On diagnostic endoscopy, gastric variceal bleeding is 
confirmed in the presence of active bleeding from a vis￾ualized varix, presence of adherent clot or stigmata of 
recent haemorrhage over the GV and recurrent bleeding 
in a patient with PH and presence of GV in the absence of 
other identifiable sources of bleeding [26].
The general measures for initial optimization of clini￾cal status to prevent further deterioration due to acute 
gastric variceal bleeding are similar to those followed 
in esophageal variceal bleeding. This includes airway 
protection through endotracheal intubation to prevent 
aspiration, maintaining minimum systolic blood pres￾sure of 70  mm Hg for performing urgent diagnostic 
and therapeutic endoscopy and the judicious use of 
packed red cells for target hemoglobin levels between 
7 and 8  g/dL (21% haematocrit). Volume expansion 
and coagulation correction using fresh frozen plasma 
or plasma expanders lead to severe adverse clinical 
events in patients with cirrhosis and variceal bleeding 
and must be avoided. A conventional dose of two fresh 
frozen plasma units can only replace 10% of the clot￾ting factors. Large volume coagulation correction can 
lead to worsening PH, sepsis, sinister systemic immu￾nomodulation, and rebleeding. In cirrhosis, a minimum 
platelet count 56,000/mL corresponds to adequate 
thrombin generation and is the ideal target for endo￾scopic interventions. Similarly, maintaining fibrinogen 
level > 120  mg/dL also improves haemostatic effects 
[27–29]. Although the use of vasoactive agents for the 
reduction in portal pressure and control of rebleed￾ing specific to gastric variceal bleeding is unavailable 
in literature, the same line of supportive therapy as 
for esophageal variceal bleeding, is currently recom￾mended. Wang et  al. in their systematic review and 
meta-analysis showed that there was no difference 
between vasopressin/terlipressin and somatostatin/

octreotide in the prevention of re-bleeding after the 
initial treatment of bleeding esophageal varices [30]. 
Antibiotic prophylaxis, lactulose for the prevention of 
hepatic encephalopathy along with other supportive 
measures that include varying degrees of organ sup￾port depending on the severity of systemic dysfunction 
is mandated in GV bleed [31]. In a patient with active 
bleeding that preclude endoscopic treatment, tempo￾rizing measures such as intragastric balloon tamponade 
can be utilized. These devices can only be placed for 
a maximum of 24  h within which definitive treatment 
has to be carried out. Given its large volume capacity, 
a Linton-Nachlas tube is considered ideal for gastric 
variceal bleeding [32].
Endoscopic band ligation
Endoscopic band ligation (EBL) is the initial treat￾ment of choice in the management of acute esophageal 
variceal bleeding. Initially, several small patient series 
demonstrated that EBL was safe and effective for bleed￾ing GV. Two randomized controlled trials comparing 
EBL to cyanoacrylate glue therapy showed that initial

in type 3, the sclerosant tends to flow in the direction of large shunt [(c1, c2 (arrows)]; in type A (d1, d2), sclerosant completely fills the varices 
without run-off; in type B the sclerosant flows into the systemic veins (e1, arrows) and hence the associated high flow collateral vein needs 
additional gelfoam occlusion (e2, arrows) before sclerosant injection; in type C in presence of both gastrocaval (f1, arrow) and gastrorenal shunts 
the sclerosant tends to flow into a systemic vein through the second shunt. Hence the outflow shunt is occluded first with gelfoam (f2, arrow); in 
type D gastric varices (g), without draining veins, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt placement is ideal choice for complete variceal 
complex obliteration; h classical pre (h1, h2) and post (h3, h4) computed tomography demonstration of obliteration of gastric varices associated

haemostasis was lower and rebleeding rates higher (63% 
and 72% at 2 and 3 years respectively) in the former. In 
the absence of cyanoacrylate glue, EBL can be considered 
in patients with Type 1 GOV bleeding for initial control 
of bleeding until further definitive management can be 
undertaken [33, 34].
Sclerotherapy
Injection sclerotherapy for GV has been demonstrated 
to be less effective than what is noted with esophageal 
varices. The agents used for sclerotherapy include ethan￾olamine oleate, sodium tetradecyl, glucose solutions, and 
acetic acid. High blood flow within the GV results in the 
early flush of injected sclerosants, reducing its efficacy. In 
such situations, larger volumes of injection can be con￾templated. However, in reality, it leads to adverse events 
such as febrile illness, severe retrosternal discomfort, 
ulcerations, mediastinitis, embolization in the presence 
of large portosystemic shunts and perforations that can 
result in approximately 50% mortality. The rebleeding 
rates with sclerotherapy alone can be as high as 90%, of 
which 50% bleeds are secondary to injection site ulcera￾tions. Sclerotherapy has greater success for control of 
bleeding and prevention of rebleeding in esophageal 
variceal disease [35, 36]. Currently, EBL or cyanoacr￾ylate glue injection is considered the treatment of choice 
for Type 1 GOV bleeding and cyanoacrylate glue injec￾tion for Type 2 GOV and isolated GV. Some authors have 
used EBL along with sclerotherapy for management of 
Type 1 GOV bleeding with an injection of 1 mL of scle￾rosant above the site intended for band ligation. The suc￾cess rate for haemostasis with this approach is close to 
90% with the risk of rebleeding in 33%. EBL should only 
be performed in patients with bleeding from small Type 
1 GOV in which both the mucosal and contralateral wall 
of the vessel undergoes complete suction into the ligator, 
without which the likelihood of band detachment is high 
leading to ulceration of the overlying vessel and cata￾strophic secondary bleeding [35, 36].
Endoscopic cyanoacrylate glue therapy
N-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate (NBC) is a monomeric tissue 
adhesive that rapidly polymerize on contact with blood 
leading to hardening of varix, cast formation, and obtura￾tion. The NBC is the most commonly employed agent for 
glue therapy and undergoes polymerization within 20  s 
of contact with blood inside the variceal lumen. Lipiodol 
(ethiodized oil composed of iodine combined with ethyl 
esters of fatty acids of poppyseed oil, primarily as ethyl 
monoiodostearate and ethyl di-iodostearate) or normal 
saline is sometimes used to avoid occlusion in the endos￾copy channel. A 1:1 mixture is usually recommended and 
can reduce the risk of embolization. It is recommended 
that a 3.7  mm width channel endoscope be utilized for 
ease in glue administration. Some newer glue prod￾ucts such as 2-octyl-cyanoacrylate and NBC mixed with 
methacryloyloxy-sulfolane do not require dilutional 
agents due to the slow polymerization time [37, 38]. In a 
Cochrane Database Review, a meta-analysis of three ran￾domized controlled trials comparing cyanoacrylate glue 
therapy versus EBL demonstrated both therapies to be 
effective for control of bleeding, but significantly lower 
rates of rebleeding was noted with the former. These 
studies included mostly Type 1 GOV bleeds and utilized 
NBC [39].
Endoscopic thrombin injection and inorganic haemostatic 
powder spray
Another treatment modality infrequently used in gastric 
variceal bleed control is thrombin injection in which cat￾alysation of fibrinogen to fibrin with additional platelet 
function augmentation enhances cot formation within 
the bleeding varix. This is an attractive alternative to glue 
therapy where expertise is unavailable and has fewer side 
effects and systemic complications. Five millilitres of 
thrombin have the potency to coagulate one litre of blood 
in less than a minute. Even though thrombin treatment 
was found beneficial in controlling bleeding from GV, 
especially Type 2 GOV in small single-center series, high￾quality studies were lacking [40–43]. Recently, Lo and 
colleagues, in a prospective randomized trial, showed 
that endoscopic thrombin injection was similar to glue 
injection in achieving successful haemostasis of acute 
GV bleeding but with higher incidence of complications 
associated with the latter [44]. Few reports demonstrat￾ing the use of inorganic absorbent powder TC-325 hae￾mostatic spray (Hemospray®, Cook Medical, IN, USA) 
in patients with refractory gastric variceal bleeding after 
the failure of glue injection therapy has been published in 
the literature. The issue with haemostatic powder spray is 
that it can act only in the presence of active bleeding dur￾ing endoscopy [45].
Endoscopic‑ultrasound guided therapy for gastric varices
EUS color Doppler can help distinguish GV from gastro￾intestinal tumors and prominent gastric folds and allows 
real-time confirmation of GV obliteration through pre￾cise identification of perforating feeder vessels and accu￾rate delivery of tissue adhesive decreasing the amount 
of glue injected and reducing the risk of embolization 
(Fig. 5). Romero-Castro et al. performed a proof-of-con￾cept study on EUS-guided glue therapy for bleeding GV 
and utilized lipiodol to localize feeder vessels before glue 
use accurately [46]. Lee et al. showed that late rebleeding 
rate beyond 48 h was significantly lower in patients with 
GV bleeding receiving EUS guided glue injections every 

Philips et al. BMC Gastroenterol (2020) 20:361 Page 10 of 14
2-weeks until eradication [47]. In another single center 
study, 90% of patients experienced complete haemosta￾sis after glue injection into the afferent vessels confirmed 
on color Doppler, without rebleeding events in the short 
term [48].
EUS-guided coiling of GV was shown to enhance hae￾mostasis in multiple series. The metal coils, made from 
synthetic stainless-steel fibre induce clot formation and 
thrombosis of varix. Usually, a 19-G access needle is uti￾lized, but 22-G needles for the deployment of smaller 
coils are also available. Levy and colleagues were the 
first to report on EUS-guided coiling of ectopic GV. A 
multicenter cohort study by Romero-Castro and col￾leagues demonstrated that there were no significant dif￾ferences between glue injection compared to coiling 
for haemostasis of bleeding GV at 180-days. Neverthe￾less, the mean endoscopic session time and the number 
of sessions required for variceal obturation was lower 
in patients receiving EUS-guided coiling [49, 50]. The 
combined use of EUS-guided coil placement along with 
cyanoacrylate glue injection results in en-mass ‘scaffold’ 
formation which is associated with very efficient control 
of bleeding and reduction in the rate of rebleeding. Com￾bined EUS-guided therapy promoted gastric variceal 
eradication in 96% of treated patients with a single sitting 
with only 16% experiencing rebleeding over a follow-up 
period of 6-months without any minor or major adverse 
events [51]. Similar findings were demonstrated by Bhat 
et  al. in their study on 100 patients. However, adverse 
events in the form of pulmonary embolism and self-lim￾ited abdominal pain occurred in 5% [52]. A recently per￾formed systematic review and meta-analysis showed that 
EUS combination therapy with coil embolization and 
glue injection was a preferred strategy for the treatment 
of GV over EUS-based monotherapy [53].
Endovascular therapy for bleeding gastric varices
Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt 
(TIPS) The role of TIPS in controlling acute variceal 
bleeding in the event of rebleeding or uncontrolled bleed￾Fig. 5 Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) guided coiling and glue therapy for recurrent bleeding from gastric varices. Large gastric varix is noted (a) 
with turbulent blood flow within (b). A 22 G aspiration needle is pushed into the varix (c) and coils inserted into the varix lumen under direct vision 
(d). Additionally, 1.5 mL of cyanoacrylate glue is injected to completely obliterate the variceal lumen (e). Immediate post treatment, the turbulent 
flow has almost disappeared from variceal complex (f). Six months after treatment, the coils are visible on abdominal fluoroscopy (g) and there is 
complete obliteration with loss of Doppler signals from the varix on repeat EUS (h)

ing from esophageal varices is well documented. Even 
though TIPS can promote haemostasis in acute GV 
bleeding, varices can persist and bleed at lower portal 
pressures than esophageal varices. Previous retrospec￾tive studies have shown that in patients with GV haem￾orrhage undergoing TIPS placement in the absence of 
adjuvant variceal embolotherapy, the GV remained pat￾ent in 65% with rebleeding in 27% and 90-days mortality 
of 15%. Another study also reported that 50% of patients 
post TIPS had persistence of GV with 27% rebleed rates 
[54, 55]. A meta-analysis comparing TIPS to endoscopic 
variceal sclerotherapy (EVS) in the management of GV 
bleeding in terms rebleeding, hepatic encephalopathy and 
survival demonstrated improved benefits of TIPS in the 
prevention of GV rebleeding that was associated with an 
increased risk of encephalopathy with comparable sur￾vival between study groups [56].
Various theories have contemplated the ineffectiveness 
of TIPS alone for complete control of bleeding from GV. 
The ‘proximity’ theory states that esophageal varices are 
well decompressed after TIPS since the left gastric vein 
supplying the varices are small and close enough to ben￾efit from decompression through shunt creation. The 
GV, on the other hand, is farther away, larger, and associ￾ated with multiple afferents depending on the collateral 
anatomy of the variceal complex. As per the ‘throughput’ 
theory, low-pressure shunts from large-calibre inflow 
and outflow vessels associated with GV compete with 
and effectively decompress the TIPS stent leading to the 
persistence of varices. The ‘recruitment’ theory states 
that new afferent vessels form after treatment of a gas￾tric variceal system post TIPS due to the complexity in 
afferent and efferent flow pathways, all of which do not 
undergo decompression or undergo only partial emboli￾zation unexpectedly. In such situations, shunt occlusion 
and TIPS may be more effective than TIPS alone [57, 58].
Retrograde or  antegrade transvenous embolization 
of  gastric varices The American College of Radiology 
Appropriateness Criteria Committee on interventional 
radiology recently recognized BRTO as an alternative to 
TIPS in specific clinical situations for treatment of GV. 
As per current conservative practice, BRTO is reserved 
for those patients who are ineligible for TIPS. However, 
with improvement in understanding of hemodynamic 
physiology associated with the variceal disease, this has 
changed to incorporate a combination of endovascular 
therapies. A meta-analysis on post-procedure outcomes 
in 1016 patients who underwent BRTO for management 
of bleeding GV demonstrated technical success, i.e., com￾plete thrombosis of the GV on short-term follow up imag￾ing and control of active bleeding among 96.4% patients. 
Absence of rebleeding and no bleeding in high-risk GV 
was notable in 97.3% on follow up. However, most studies 
were retrospective in nature and included patients who 
underwent primary prophylactic BRTO for high-risk GV 
[59]. In another meta-analysis, on clinical outcomes in GV 
bleeding among 353 patients undergoing TIPS (n=143) 
or BRTO (n=210), it was found that no significant dif￾ferences were notable with respect to technical success, 
haemostasis and complication rates between both treat￾ments. Nevertheless, rebleeding and hepatic encepha￾lopathy were significantly lesser in those who underwent 
BRTO [60]. Adverse events associated with conventional 
BRTO include fever, chest pain, gastrointestinal symp￾toms, haemoglobinuria, ascites, and pleural effusion. It 
was shown that the occlusion of a large gastrorenal shunt 
could increase the hepatic venous pressure gradient by up 
to 44% from the baseline. BRTO was found to aggravate 
pre-existing esophageal varices (ranging from 30 to 68%), 
leading to variceal bleeding even though associated death 
is never reported. In this context, a pre-shunt-occlusion 
endoscopy and prophylactic band ligation of large or 
high-risk esophageal varices are prudent.
In some patients, with GV bleeding, the combination 
of endovascular procedures could be more efficacious 
than singular treatments which in turn depends on the 
variceal collateral pathway anatomy. For example, as per 
the afferent flow classification, patients with Kiyosue type 
1 GV can be easily managed with only shunt emboliza￾tion. In contrast, TIPS placement would benefit those 
patients with GV and associated multiple collateral affer￾ents in the absence of a dominant shunt (Type 2 of Kiyo￾sue classification). Alternatively, in patients with afferent 
and efferent shunts as well as multiple collaterals (such 
as Kiyosue or Saad Caldwell Type C2), a combination of 
TIPS and shunt embolization could be more beneficial. 
Shunt embolization, along with TIPS placement, negates 
the high flow through the shunt, reduces rebleeding 
rates, improves TIPS efficacy, shunt patency and flow and 
decreases the incidence of hepatic encephalopathy [32, 
58, 59]. In patients with large portosystemic shunts, it is 
not uncommon to notice an attenuated portal vein that 
is difficult to cannulate for the TIPS procedure. Shunt 
embolization improves portal vein inflow and increases 
portal vein diameter making a technically challeng￾ing TIPS procedure far more comfortable to perform. A 
combination of multiple embolization techniques, such 
as inflow modulation through coils or balloon occlusion 
followed by sclerosant injection and outflow modula￾tion utilizing a plug, can lead to complete embolization 
of the variceal system with a reduction in sclerosant 
migration to untargeted regions. There are no published 
multicenter series of randomized trials on TIPS and 
combination shunt embolization procedures. Saad and 
colleagues reported outcomes in 36 patients undergoing 

Philips et al. BMC Gastroenterol (2020) 20:361 Page 12 of 14
BRTO procedure for gastric variceal bleeding in whom 9 
underwent simultaneous TIPS placement. It was shown 
that the ascites and hydrothorax free rate for BRTO ver￾sus BRTO+TIPS at six months and one year was 58% 
and 29% compared to 100% and 100%, respectively. A 
significant reduction in recurrence of haemorrhage was 
also noted in the combination group demonstrating the 
fact that TIPS improved the PH burden developing after 
BRTO. Another prospective randomized controlled trial 
of TIPS alone versus TIPS with adjunctive left gastric vein 
embolization found a significant reduction in 180  days 
overall rebleeding rate in the embolization group [61, 
62]. In a meta-analysis that compared the incidence of 
shunt dysfunction, variceal rebleeding, encephalopathy, 
and death between patients treated with TIPS alone and 
those treated with combined variceal embolization it was 
shown that variceal embolization during TIPS procedure 
improved the prevention of rebleeding, but no significant 
differences were identified concerning shunt dysfunc￾tion, encephalopathy, or mortality [63]. Thus, the treat￾ment of gastric variceal bleeding has evolved through 
the years and is currently far from the current standard 
recommendations to better suit the patient, dependent 
on the hemodynamic classification and with reasonable 
control of portal hypertensive complications. An algo￾rithm for treatment decisions regarding gastric variceal 
bleeding is shown in Fig. 6.
Conclusion
Gastric variceal haemorrhage is associated with high 
rebleeding rates and mortality than esophageal variceal 
bleeding. Endoscopic cyanoacrylate glue therapy is the 
current standard recommendation for the manage￾ment of gastric variceal bleeding. However, with a bet￾ter understanding of the anatomic and hemodynamic 
components associated with the gastric variceal sys￾tem, advanced options for bettering clinical outcomes 
are in evolution. These include EUS assisted combina￾tion approaches and multiple endovascular techniques 
including TIPS and shunt embolization or their combi￾nations that can be offered to patients, depending on the 
underlying liver disease severity, collateral pathway anat￾omy, affordability and availability of technical expertise.
