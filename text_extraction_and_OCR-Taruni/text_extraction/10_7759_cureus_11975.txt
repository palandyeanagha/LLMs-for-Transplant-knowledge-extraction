Abstract
Introduction
The world over, hepatitis C virus (HCV) engenders the risk of developing chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis and
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). It has many extrahepatic manifestations, among which diabetes and
metabolic syndrome (MetS) has been increasingly recognized and has become an active research field. The
current study aimed to ascertain the frequency of MetS in chronic hepatitis C patients and to curb its long￾term adverse outcomes.
Methods
In our cross-sectional analysis, a total of 331 subjects diagnosed with chronic HCV were registered from June
2017 to November 2018 in two tertiary care hospitals of Karachi, Pakistan. Metabolic syndrome (MetS) was
delineated following the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP
III). Categorical variables were compared by using the Chi-square test, and a significant P value was at the
value of < 0.05.
Results
We found that adults of 40 - 49 years of age were the worst sufferers of hepatitis C. Out of the total 331
patients of hepatitis C, 97 (29.3%) cases were suffering from metabolic syndrome.
Conclusion
Prevalence of MetS is substantial among HCV-infected individuals Therefore estimation of MetS in
individuals with HCV infection is imperative and patients should be educated for lifestyle modification, diet,
and weight control. However, we cannot generalized the results of our study as it was done in some tertiary
care centres, so additional surveys are warranted to know the actual prevalence of MetS in our entire
population.

Introduction
Ubiquitously hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a crucial public health problem and can give rise to hepatic and
extra-hepatic complications. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) census 2013, over 71
million people across the globe are suffering from HCV [1]. In Pakistan, the prevalence of HCV is
approximately 6% [2]. The National Hepatitis Study documented that eight million individuals are suffering
from this life-threatening virus and among them, many individuals are unaware of having this viral disease,
resulting in delayed disease detection and therapy. Karachi is one of the biggest cities in Pakistan and has an
occurrence rate of 5.5% [3].
In chronic hepatitis C (CHC) sufferers, MetS is a common association. According to studies, HCV has no
personal linkage with the lipid metabolism in hepatocytes, however it interrupts the circulating lipoprotein
metabolism. HCV virus affects very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) particles and takes over the formative
pathway of the VLDL particle for production of an infectious particle named lipoprotein viral particle (LVP)
[4], which circulates in the bloodstream and actively exchanges HCV among lipoproteins and hence
contributes to the pathophysiology of the disease. Hepatitis C causes insulin resistance, which affects the
hormone-sensitive lipase, leading to more conversion of triglyceride into free fatty acid. Damage of the liver
due to hepatitis C enables the triglyceride metabolisms, hence the free fatty acid increase in the blood
causing hypertriglyceridemia [5-7].

MetS is a cluster of problems that increases the risk of developing various diseases. It is related to the
probability of subsequent development of insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and micro and
macrovascular complications [8]. Microalbuminuria and hyperuricemia are also observed to be part of this
cluster [9]. The presence of these disorders hastens the possibility of developing hepatocellular carcinoma
(HCC) [10]. In a systematic review, Dyal et al. concluded that CHC patients with diabetes are at greater
likelihood for HCC development [11]. Hepatitis C has a relationship with insulin resistance and type 2
diabetes mellitus. Findings from a previous studies by Negro et al. [12] indicate that resistance to antiviral
treatment may be related to insulin resistance.
The delayed diagnosis of hepatitis C eventually results in cirrhosis, HCC, and cardiovascular complications
related to MetS [9,13]. A systematic review and meta-analysis by Ambrosino et al. showed a significantly
increased menace of cardio-cerebrovascular diseases in HCV patients [14]. Several studies also had been
done in other parts of the world to find an association between MetS and CHC. Our study intended to
ascertain the frequency of MetS in victims of CHC.
Materials And Methods
A total of 331 individuals with confirmed HCV infection were enrolled in our cross-sectional analysis. The
sample size was calculated by Open Epi version 3 (Open Source Epidemiologic Statistics for Public Health;
www.OpenEpi.com) assuming a 95% confidence level, frequency of MetS 26%, and 10% non-response rate.
Patients who visited the liver clinic in the department of medicine in two tertiary care hospitals of Karachi,
Pakistan from June 2017 to November 2018 with positive hepatitis C by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
were selected. All adult male and female patients with age >18 with the diagnosis of hepatitis C were
included and all patients were treatment-naive. Patients with a history of alcohol consumption,
decompensate chronic liver disease, pregnant females, concomitant malignancy, heart and renal disease, co￾infection with hepatitis B and HIV/AIDS were excluded from the study.
MetS were delineated based on the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Adult Treatment Panel
III (ATP III) standards. Patients with three or more of the following five criteria were labelled as MetS [15]:
waist circumference ≥ 80 centimeters (cms) in females and ≥ 90 cms in males, blood pressure ≥130/85 mmHg
or higher, fasting blood sugar (FBS) ≥ 100 mg /dl, fasting high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol ≤40 mg/
dl in men or ≤ 50 mg/dl in women, fasting triglycerides (TG) level ≥150 mg/dl [16].
Anthropometric data including waist and hip circumference, height, and weight were recorded by the trained
staff, according to standardized criteria recommended by WHO [17]. Flexible inch tape was used for the
estimation of the waist and hip circumference. The waist was measured at the midpoint between the costal
margin and the iliac crest while the hip circumference was measured at the widest part of the buttocks.
Measurements of height and weight were done by using stadiometers and calibrated digital weighing scales
respectively. Body mass index (BMI) was computed by putting the values in the standardized formula of
weight in Kg/height in meters square. Blood pressure was measured by a digital automatic blood pressure
device (Omron HEM - 907 model; OMRON, Kyoto, Japan), in a seated position. Blood samples were drawn
after 10 hours of fasting. All blood investigations were done by the Clinical Diagnostic Laboratories from the
same hospitals.
The diagnosis of HCV was established based on a positive serum antibodies test and its authentication was
done by qualitative HCV ribonucleic acid (RNA). The HCV antibodies were checked by enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method using Biotek ELx 800 (BioTek Instruments, Winooski, Vermont, USA).
Qualitative HCV RNA was conducted by Abbott Real-Time PCR Assay m2000sp and m2000rt (Abbott
Laboratories, Abbott Park, Illinois, USA).
Lipid profile, fasting blood glucose, uric acid, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and gamma-glutamyl
transferase (GGT) were done using Architect ci4100 analyzer by Abbott Core Laboratory. The data entry and
analysis were done by using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 19 (IBM Corp., Armonk,
NY, USA). Categorical variables (such as gender, course of hepatitis C) were expressed in frequency(%) while
numerical variables were expressed as mean ± SD of BMI, waist circumference, lipid profile, and fasting
blood glucose.
The categorical variables were compared by using chi-square and p-value will be significant as <0.05. Ethical
permission was given from the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of Liaquat College of Medicine and
Dentistry (IRB-28/LCMD/11/2019) and written informed consent was signed by all participants.
Results
More than half (57%) of the patients belonged to 40 - 49 years of age, followed by 21% in 50 - 59 years and
11% in the age group between 30 - 39 years. The average age of patients was 47.5 +4.85 and 122 (36.9%) were
males and 209 (63.1%) were females. As high as 252 (76%) of the patients were hypertensive and 126 (38%)
were diabetic. MetS was found in 97 (29.3%) of the patients out of the total of 331 subjects. Among a total of
97 MetS patients, systolic blood pressure >130 mmHg was found in 67 (69.1%) patients while diastolic >85
mmHg in 46 (47.4%) patients. Triglycerides above 150 mg/dl were found in 55 (56.70%) patients and increase

total cholesterol in 47 (48.45%) patients. High-density lipoprotein was lower than <40 mg/dl in 15 (4.5%)
patients only. Seventy-one (73.2%) patients with MetS had high fasting plasma glucose. We observed that
uric acid level in our patients was in the range between 3.0 mg/dl to 8.30 mg/dl. No statistically significant
(p>0.05) difference was observed between the frequency of metabolic syndrome and the duration of
hepatitis C (Tables 1, 2).

Discussion
Hepatitis C is highly prevalent in Pakistan and is linked with increased morbidity and mortality. We found
that adults of 40 - 49 years of age are the worst sufferers of hepatitis C. There were 97 (29.3%) cases
suffering from MetS out of the total sampled patients (331) of hepatitis C. A study from Pakistan by Bashir et
al. showed a prevalence of MetS to be 17.78 %, quite lower than in our study [18]. This significant difference
between the two studies from Pakistan is probably because of the difference in ethnicity. The study by
Bashir et al. was conducted at Rahim Yar Khan, the Punjab side of Pakistan so checked in the Punjabi
population while our study was conducted in the metropolitan city of Karachi, with people from multiple
ethnicities including Punjabi, Sindhi, Pakhtoon, Urdu speaking, and Baluchi. Another reason for the
difference is probably the increased number of female subjects (63%) in our study in contrast to 33% in the
study by Bashir et al. Oliveira et al. reported 21.6% MetS in Hepatitis C virus-infected patients while a study
from Taiwan showed a prevalence of 25.6% in CHC patients [19,20]. On comparing our study with another
study done by Hung et al., with results showing 24.7% MetS in CHC patients, however, they had more
patients with genotype 1 [21]. From the previous studies done across Pakistan, we already know that
genotype 3 is predominant in our hepatitis C patients [22].
As regards the lipid profile, only 15 had significantly lower HDL-C. Fifty-five participants had higher levels
of cholesterol, triglycerides (TGs) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). These findings are
juxtaposed to the Taiwan study that imparted significantly lower cholesterol, LDL-C levels, HDL-C and TG
levels in anti-HCV positive individuals [21]. In our study of 97 patients with MetS, 85% were overweight and
88% had a high waist circumference. The same results were demonstrated in the study done by Hung et al.
[21]. Moucari et al. did a study on 600 patients with chronic hepatitis and found that 32% of the patients
associated with MetS had insulin-resistant diabetes [23].
Hypertension, overweight, central obesity, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes mellitus have terribly
confederated with MetS. Consequently, it is crucial to keep track of insulin resistance, weight, and blood
pressure, as it would be instrumental to save our patients from adverse outcomes of this syndrome.
Especially it is paramount to maintain healthy body weight as working on this risk factor solely can decrease
the occurrence of co-morbidities and perhaps impedes the succession of chronic liver disease. Early
diagnosis of hepatitis C is very much important as a timely intervention with new direct-acting antivirals
(DAA) which can significantly decrease the risk associated with metabolic manifestations of chronic HCV
[24].
Conclusions
There is a high preponderance of MetS in chronic HCV infected individuals. Estimation of MetS in HCV￾infected individuals may conceivably be requisite and patients should be educated for lifestyle modification,
diet, and weight control. The limitation of our study is that it was conducted in some tertiary care hospitals,
therefore the results cannot be generalized to the entire population. Further extensive analyses are
imperative to reckon the prevalence of MetS in our hepatitis C positive population. Another limitation is
that this study was conducted in the metropolitan city of Karachi on subjects with multiple ethnicities, so
more studies are required in each ethnic group. It is also paramount to appraise whether the response to
antiviral treatments can be improved with interventions involving remodelling of the lifestyle.
