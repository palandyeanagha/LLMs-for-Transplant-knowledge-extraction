Abstract
Background: Bloodstream infections (BSIs) by Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-producing Klebsiella
pneumoniae (Kp) are associated with high mortality. The aim of this study is to assess the relationship between time
to administration of appropriate antibiotic therapy and the outcome of patients with BSI due to KPC-Kp hospitalized in
intensive care unit (ICU).
Methods: An observational study was conducted in the ICUs of two academic centers in Italy. Patients with KPC-Kp
bacteremia hospitalized between January 2015 to December 2018 were included. The primary outcome was the
relationship between time from blood cultures (BC) collection to appropriate antibiotic therapy and 30-day mortality.
The secondary outcome was to evaluate the association of different treatment regimens with 30-day mortality and a
composite endpoint (30-day mortality or nephrotoxicity). A Cox regression analysis to identify factors independently
associated with 30-day mortality was performed. Hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated.
Results: A total of 102 patients with KPC-Kp BSI were included. The most common sources of infection were intra￾abdominal (23.5%), urinary tract (20.6%), and skin and skin structure (17.6%). The 30-day mortality was 45%. Median
time to appropriate antibiotic therapy was shorter in patients who survived (8.5 h [IQR 1–36]) versus those who died
(48 h [IQR 5–108], p = 0.014). A propensity score matching showed that receipt of an in vitro active therapy within 24 h
from BC collection was associated with lower 30-day mortality (HR = 0.36, 95% CI: 0.188–0.690, p = 0.0021). At Cox
regression analysis, factors associated with 30-day mortality were primary bacteremia (HR 2.662 [95% CI 1.118–6.336],
p = 0.027), cardiovascular disease (HR 2.196 [95% CI 1.082–4.457], p = 0.029), time (24-h increments) from BC collection
to appropriate therapy (HR 1.382 [95% CI 1.132–1.687], p = 0.001), SOFA score (HR 1.122 [95% CI 1.036–1.216], p = 0.005),
and age (HR 1.030 [95% CI 1.006–1.054], p = 0.012). Ceftazidime-avibactam-containing regimens were associated with
reduced risk of composite endpoint (30-day mortality OR nephrotoxicity) (HR 0.231 [95% CI 0.071–0.745], p = 0.014)
compared to colistin-containing regimens.
Conclusions: Time to appropriate antibiotic therapy is an independent predictor of 30-day mortality in patients with
KPC-Kp BSI. Appropriate antibiotic therapy should begin within 24 h from the collection of BC.

Introduction
The spread of Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase
(KPC)-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (Kp) is an urgent
public health threat requiring immediate action [1, 2]. As
a matter of fact, carbapenem-resistant (CR) Kp infections
are associated with high attributable mortality (2118
attributable deaths out of a total of 15,947 infections), and
with a median number of total disability-adjusted life years
of 11.5 per 100,000 population [3]. Mortality rates of
patients with bloodstream infections (BSIs) caused by
KPC-Kp range from 40 to 50% [4, 5].
Treatment of patients with BSIs caused by KPC-Kp
represents a challenge for clinicians, and no data from
randomized clinical trials comparing different antibiotic
strategies are currently available [6]. Observational stud￾ies indicate that combination therapies are more effect￾ive than monotherapies [7, 8]. Moreover, a retrospective
study performed in intensive care unit (ICU) patients
with septic shock showed that an antibiotic regimen
containing at least two in vitro active antibiotics is asso￾ciated with improved survival [9]. Novel drugs represent
new promising treatment options, but larger studies are
needed to evaluate their impact on survival of patients
with KPC-Kp infections [10–12]. Thus, the optimal ther￾apy of KPC-Kp BSI has not been defined.
Timely and appropriate antimicrobial therapy is critic￾ally important for treatment of patients with BSI [13, 14].
Recent studies highlighted that inappropriate empiric
treatment is associated with poor outcome of patients
with urinary tract [15] or any type of infection due to
KPC-Kp [16, 17]. Among non-neutropenic patients with
BSI due to KPC-Kp, Satlin et al. did not find any associ￾ation between timing of active therapy and mortality, but
a trend to higher mortality rates was observed in patients
who did not receive active therapy within the first 12 h
from BSI onset [18]; however, the majority of patients
(84%) acquired infection in the community or in non-ICU
wards [18]. Thus, the relationship between timing of ap￾propriate therapy and outcome of BSI caused by KPC-Kp
has not been specifically investigated in ICU patients.
The aim of this study was to assess the relationship
between the time to appropriate antibiotic therapy and
the clinical outcome in ICU patients with BSI caused by
KPC-Kp.
Methods
Study design and data collection
This observational retrospective study was conducted
from January 2015 to December 2018 in two University
tertiary care hospitals: Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria
Pisana (Pisa, Italy) and Santa Maria della Misericordia
Hospital (Udine, Italy). All consecutive adult patients
with a BSI due to KPC-Kp hospitalized in ICU were in￾cluded in the study. Patients with polymicrobial BSIs
were excluded. The study was conducted according to
the principles stated in the Declaration of Helsinki.
Data were extracted from the medical records of pa￾tients and from hospital computerized databases. The
following data were collected: demographics, clinical and
laboratory findings, comorbidities, microbiologic data,
source of infection, and source control. All patients under￾went screening rectal swab at admission in the ICU and
twice weekly. Data about rectal colonization by KPC-Kp
were recorded. Sequential Organ Failure Assessment
(SOFA) score at time of BSI and APACHE II score were
calculated [19, 20]. Data about hospitalization and anti￾biotic therapy in the previous 90 days before the BSI were
also reviewed. Treatment regimens were analyzed and
time from collection of blood cultures to administration
of appropriate antibiotic therapy was calculated and re￾ported in hours.
Outcome and assessments
The primary outcome of the study was the relationship
between the time to appropriate antibiotic therapy and
30-day mortality. Time to appropriate antibiotic therapy
was defined as the time (in hours) from blood culture
collection and the administration of in vitro active anti￾biotic therapy. In order to evaluate the impact of time to
appropriate antibiotic therapy on 30-day mortality, time
was assessed as categories of 24-h increments.
The secondary outcome was to evaluate if different
treatment regimens influence the 30-day mortality and a
composite endpoint of mortality or nephrotoxicity (post￾baseline increase in serum creatinine > 1.0 mg/dL or ad￾verse events preferred term of renal failure, renal failure
acute, or renal impairment). To this end, we identified
three groups of treatment: (1) colistin-containing regi￾men, (2) ceftazidime/avibactam (± fosfomycin or amino￾glycosides), (3) other regimens.
Definitions
A KPC-Kp BSI was defined as a BSI documented by
blood culture positivity for a KPC-Kp strain. According
to the National Healthcare Safety Network, the probable
source of BSI was assessed according to the available
clinical and microbiological information and classified
by the investigators using the following categories: BSI
from central venous catheter (CVC), respiratory tract
infection, urinary tract infection (UTI), skin and skin
structure infection (SSTI), intra-abdominal infection
(IAI), endocarditis, and primary BSI in the absence of an
identified source of infection growing the same organism
as recovered from blood [21]. The CVC was considered
a likely source of infection if the blood culture obtained
from the lumen of the catheter was positive at a time
< 2 h compared to peripheral veins, and/or culture of
the catheter was positive.
Falcone et al. Critical Care (2020) 24:29 Page 2 of 12

BSI onset was defined as the date of collection of the
index blood culture. Time to adequate antibiotic therapy
was defined as the number of hours from blood culture
collection and the administration of active antibiotic
therapy. Control of removable source of infection was
defined as removal of any preexisting contaminated
CVC and as drainage of intra-abdominal abscesses or
other fluid collections thought to be the source of KPC￾Kp infection within 24 h from the onset of BSI. Cardio￾vascular disease was defined as the presence of one or
more of the following conditions: previous coronary
heart disease, peripheral arterial disease, heart failure,
paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and chronic (persistent or
permanent) atrial fibrillation [22].
BSI episodes were classified as nosocomial, healthcare￾associated, and community-acquired according to previ￾ous definitions [23]. Nosocomial BSIs were defined by
positive blood cultures obtained from patients who had
been hospitalized for 48 h or longer; health care￾associated BSIs were defined by positive blood cultures
obtained from a patient at the time of hospital admission
or within 48 h of admission if the patient fulfilled any of
the following criteria: received intravenous therapy at
home, received wound care or specialized nursing care
or had self-administered intravenous medical therapy in
the 30 days before the BSI, attended a hospital or
hemodialysis clinic or received intravenous chemother￾apy in the 30 days before the BSI, was hospitalized in an
acute care hospital for two or more days in the 90 days
before the BSI, or was a resident in a nursing home or
long-term care facility. Community-acquired BSI was de￾fined by a positive blood culture obtained at the time of
hospital admission or within the 48 h after hospital ad￾mission for patients who did not fit the criteria for a
health care-associated infection [23]. The presence of
septic shock was defined according to the last proposed
criteria (Sepsis-3) [24]. Information about specific causes
of death was collected. Cause of death was defined as
the primary pathology (irrespective of its duration) lead￾ing to death of the patient and was classified as previ￾ously reported [25].
Antimicrobial treatment evaluation
All patients were evaluated by a dedicated infectious dis￾ease specialist throughout their entire ICU hospitalization.
Empiric antibiotic therapy was selected according to clin￾ical judgment by infectious disease specialists, which was
subsequently modified according to blood cultures results.
According to internal ICU protocols, tigecycline was
administered at high dosages (100 mg iv q12h), and ß-lac￾tams, ß-lactamase inhibitors, and carbapenems were ad￾ministered using extended infusion (meropenem over 4–
6 h). According to local ICU protocols, colistin dosages
were uniformly administered at the dosages of 9 million
IU daily in patients with normal renal function. Modifica￾tion of dosage schedules based on renal function was per￾formed according to indications from the Food and Drug
Administration [26].
Antibiotic treatment was classified as appropriate if at
least one administered antibiotic displayed documented
in vitro susceptibility according to the breakpoints estab￾lished by the European Committee on Antimicrobial
Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST). Combination therapy
was defined as treatment regimens including two or
more in vitro active antibiotics, administered at the same
time. Antibiotic regimens were also analyzed according
to the following classification: no antibiotic displaying
in vitro activity, only one antibiotic displaying in vitro
activity, and two or more antibiotics displaying in vitro
activity.
Microbiology and KPC identification
From positive blood cultures, Gram staining and a rapid
identification protocol were adopted [27]. The bacterial
pellet obtained directly from positive blood cultures was
used for MALDI-TOF MS (Bruker Daltonics) identifica￾tion and for molecular analysis. The presence of a blaKPC
gene was determined by PCR using the GeneXpert® Sys￾tem (Cepheid). Antimicrobial susceptibility tests were
performed with the SensiTitre™ system (Thermo Fisher
Scientific) or Vitek 2 automated system (bioMérieux,
Marcy l’Etoile, France) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs)
were classified according to breakpoints established by
the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility
Testing (EUCAST) [28].
Statistical analysis
Continuous variables were reported as mean ± standard
deviation and medians and interquartile ranges (IQRs)
according to their distribution. The Student t test was
used when comparing normally distributed data, and the
Mann-Whitney U test was used to analyze non-normally
distributed data. Categorical data were expressed as fre￾quency distributions, and the chi-square test or Fisher
exact test was used to determine if differences existed
between groups.
According to the primary outcome of the study, a Cox
regression analysis was performed to determine the effects
of different variables on the overall 30-day mortality and
on the 30-day mortality specifically due to infection.
Multivariate analysis using logistic regression prediction
models was constructed using a forward stepwise proced￾ure, entering all variables with univariate p < 0.05 and
those deemed clinically significant. Age, SOFA score, and
time from blood culture collection to appropriate anti￾biotic therapy were continuous (24-h increments were
considered for time to appropriate therapy). Potential
Falcone et al. Critical Care (2020) 24:29 Page 3 of 12

baseline confounders, including diabetes, cardiovascular
disease, COPD, and primary bacteremia were considered
for the multivariate analysis. The final multivariate model
was chosen according to the Akaike information criterion
and to parsimony and clinical interpretability of data.
Kaplan-Meier curves were constructed to compare time
to 30-day mortality between patients who received appro￾priate antibiotic therapy within the first 24 h from the
blood cultures collection and those who did not. More￾over, a more formal causal analysis was conducted based
on propensity scores (PS). Propensity scores were esti￾mated using a logistic regression model to predict time to
adequate therapy < 24 h using age, diabetes, Charlson Co￾morbidity index, and SOFA score. Balance tables were
used to assess adequacy of matching via propensity score.
Estimated propensity scores were then used to perform
greedy matching without replacement. The matched sub￾set was then used to estimate the relationship between
time to adequate therapy and the endpoints using Cox re￾gression. We evaluated both univariate Cox regression
models and models including a random effect specific to
each matched couple (conditional Cox regression), whose
results did not differ substantially.
A sensitivity analysis was performed to evaluate the ef￾fect of combination therapy (defined as above-reported)
on 30-day mortality. A forest plot was used to describe
the results of the sensitivity analysis.
To evaluate differences in clinical outcome among
treatment regimens, differences in 30-day mortality and
in the composite endpoint of 30-day mortality or
nephrotoxicity were analyzed using the Cox analysis.
Colistin-containing regimen was selected as reference
variable; both ceftazidime-avibactam-containing regimen
and other regimens were tested against the reference vari￾able. Patients who did not receive any in vitro active ther￾apy was excluded. Hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence
intervals (CIs) were calculated to evaluate the strength of
any association. Statistical significance was established at
p ≤ 0.05. All reported p values are two tailed. The results
obtained were analyzed using a commercially available
statistical software package (SPSS 20.0; IBM, Armonk,
NY, USA and R 3.5.1, Vienna, Austria).
Results
Study population
Among 114 ICU patients with Kp-KPC BSI, a total of
102 were included in the study. Flowchart of the study is
shown in Fig. 1. Overall, median age was 64 years (IQR
53–74). The most common source of infection was IAI
(23.5%), followed by UTI (20.6%), SSTI (17.6%), CVC
(12.7%), and pneumonia (10.8%). Fourteen (13.7%) pa￾tients had a primary BSI. The majority of patients had
recorded previous rectal colonization by KPC-Kp (51%).
Septic shock occurred in 39.2% of patients. The 7-day,
14-day, and 30-day mortality rates were 20.6%, 32.4%,
and 45%, respectively. All deaths occurred during the
ICU stay. Among 46 non-surviving patients, 43 (93.5%)
died due to infection, 2 patients (4.3%) from acute
hemorrhage, and 1 (2.2%) from acute respiratory failure.
The baseline characteristics of the study population and
the univariate analysis of patients by survival are re￾ported in Table 1. Compared to surviving patients, those
who died had a higher median age (70.5 [IQR 60–77.25]
vs 55 years [IQR 41.5–70.75], p < 0.001) were more likely

to be affected by diabetes mellitus (28.3% vs 8.9%, p =
0.011), cardiovascular disease (54.3% vs 19.6%, p <
0.001), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
(17.4% vs 3.6%, p = 0.020), and had a higher median
SOFA score (7.5 [IQR 4–9.25] vs 4 [IQR 2–10], p =
0.034). CVC-related bacteremia was more frequent
among survivors (19.6% vs 4.3%, p = 0.021), while a pri￾mary BSI was more common among patients who died
(26.1% vs 3.6%, p = 0.001). Three patients of 87, 88, and
90 years old, respectively, with multiple comorbidities re￾ceived a “do not resuscitate order (DNR); one of them
had severe burn injury.
Susceptibility rates of the 102 KPC-Kp isolates are
shown in Additional file 1: Table S1. The antibiotic
regimens used for KPC-Kp BSIs in patients by survival
status are shown in Additional file 1: Table S2. The
most frequent antibiotic regimen was colistin plus
meropenem plus tigecycline ± gentamycin (59.8%),
followed by ceftazidime-avibactam alone or in combin￾ation with fosfomycin or aminoglycosides (12.7%) and
other regimens (16.7%). Among 52 patients receiving a
combination therapy including meropenem, MIC of
the infecting strain was < 8 mg/L in 3.8% of cases,
equal to 8 mg/L in 7.7%, ranging from 16 to 64 mg/L
in 48.1%, and more than 64 mg/L in 40.4%. A pro￾longed infusion of antibiotics was used in 46 (88.5%)
patients receiving meropenem and in 2 (15.4%) pa￾tients receiving CAZ-AVI. The proportion of patients
not receiving in vitro active therapy was higher for
those who died (19.6%) compared with those who sur￾vived (3.6%, p = 0.010). Two patients with CVC-related
BSI not receiving any active antibiotic survived after a
prompt removal of the infected device. Nine patients
did not receive any antibiotic active in vitro and all of
them died during the 30 days following bacteremia: 5
of them did not receive any antibiotic therapy because
they died during the first 24 h from blood culture col￾lection; 4 of them received a regimen containing colis￾tin or tigecycline, but were affected by BSI due to pan
drug-resistant Kp.
Primary outcome analysis
The median time from blood culture collection to the
start of appropriate antibiotic therapy was significantly
shorter in surviving patients (8.5 h [IQR 1–36]) than in
patients who died (48 h [IQR 5–108], p = 0.014). Among
patients with previous rectal colonization by KPC-Kp,
time from blood culture collection to appropriate anti￾biotic therapy was significantly shorter than that ob￾served among non-colonized patients (5 h [IQR 0–49] vs
23.5 h [IQR 6–108.5], p = 0.004).
Figure 2 shows 30-day mortality rates according to dif￾ferent categories of time from blood culture collection
to appropriate antibiotic therapy. Patients appropriately
treated within the first 24 h (see Additional file 1: Table
S3) had lower 30-day mortality rates (29.1% vs 63.8%,
p < 0.001). Out of 52 patients receiving meropenem ther￾apy, there were no significant differences in the distribu￾tion of MICs between patients receiving early (within 24
h) or late (> 24 h) appropriate therapy. After the exclu￾sion of the 9 patients who did not receive any antibiotic
active in vitro, 30-day mortality rates remained higher in
patients who did not receive active antibiotic therapy
compared to those who receive an appropriate antibiotic
therapy within the first 24 h from the blood culture col￾lection (58.3% versus 29.1%, p = 0.005). Figure 3 shows
the Kaplan-Meier survival curves for patients who re￾ceived or not an appropriate antibiotic therapy within
24 h from blood culture collection. A PS-based matched
analysis was performed: we were able to match 47 cou￾ples to patients who received or not in vitro active ther￾apy within 24 h from blood culture collection. The
matched patients did not show significant differences in
exposure to variables related to early antibiotic therapy.
Conditional logistic regression in PS-matched cohorts
showed that in vitro active therapy within 24 h from
blood culture collection was associated with lower
30-day mortality (HR = 0.36, 95%CI: 0.188–0.690,
p = 0.0021).
Factors independently associated with the overall 30-
day mortality, by Cox regression analysis, were primary

culture collection to appropriate antibiotic therapy was
independently associated with 30-day mortality, even ex￾cluding patients who received only tigecycline as active
antibiotic. The sensitivity analysis showed that combin￾ation therapy with two or more in vitro active antibiotics
was not associated with increased 30-day mortality (HR

Secondary outcome analysis
Table 3 shows the comparison of 30-day mortality and
the composite endpoint according to treatment regi￾mens. No treatment regimen influenced the 30-day mor￾tality. Instead, CAZ-AVI-containing regimens were
associated with reduced risk of composite endpoint (30-
day mortality OR nephrotoxicity) (HR 0.231 [95% CI
0.071–0.745], p = 0.014) compared to colistin-containing
regimens.
Additional file 1: Figure S1 shows the comparison of
30-day mortality among the three groups of antibiotic
regimens stratified by site of infections. The higher 30-
day mortality was observed in subjects with primary
bacteremia (81.8%), followed by IAI (50%) and respira￾tory tract (33.3%), while the least mortality rate was
observed in patients with CVC-related bacteremia (18%,
p = 0.009 ANOVA test). In patients with primary
bacteremia, mortality rate was higher in patients who
received colistin-based regimen compared to those who
received other antibiotic regimens (100% vs 50%
p = 0.039). There were no differences in antibiotic dos￾ages among patients with different site of infections.
Discussion
This study demonstrates that time from blood culture
collection to appropriate antibiotic therapy is independ￾ently associated with clinical outcome for ICU patients
with BSI due to KPC-Kp, even after adjustment for co￾morbidities, severity of illness and age.
Delayed administration of appropriate antibiotic ther￾apy is associated with high mortality rates in patients
with sepsis or septic shock [29–32], and the probability
of death increases with the number of hours of delay of
antibiotic administration [31]. Moreover, time from
blood culture collection to the administration of appro￾priate antibiotic therapy also influences the length of
hospital stay [33]. No studies specifically evaluated the
impact of the timing of appropriate antibiotic therapy in
ICU patients with BSI by KPC-Kp. Our findings are
unique in the population studied and could influence
the future management of ICU patients with BSI due to
KPC-Kp.
Our study demonstrated that the administration of ap￾propriate antibiotic therapy within 24 h of blood culture
collection is associated with 30-day mortality rates lower
than 30%. Conversely, the risk of death progressively in￾creased when appropriate antibiotic therapy was started
24–48 h (mortality rate 37.5%), 48–72 h (mortality rate
57.1%), and > 72 h (mortality rate 66.7%) from the index
blood culture collection. Based on these results, the
identification of patients with a high probability of BSI
caused by KPC-Kp represents a great challenge for
clinicians.
In the clinical practice, the median turnaround time
from specimen collection to antimicrobial susceptibility
testing results is 2.71 days [34]. In our study, this time is
associated with increased mortality. Thus, it appears cru￾cial to deliver effective therapy against KPC-Kp as soon
as possible, and specifically within the first 24 h from the
collection of blood cultures. A range of strategies may
be useful in achieving this goal. According to the study
results, our hospitals implemented the following recom￾mendations for ICU patients: (i) regular rectal screening

in all hospitalized patients to early identify KPC-Kp rec￾tal carriers, (ii) starting an empirical therapy targeting
KPC-Kp in rectal carriers with septic syndrome and con￾temporary presence of additional risk factors for KPC-Kp
bacteremia (recent abdominal invasive procedure, receipt of
chemotherapy/radiation therapy, additional colonization
sites; a Giannella risk score ≥ 7 justify the administration of
antibiotics covering KPC-Kp [35]), (iii) prompt de￾escalation in case of not confirmed KPC-Kp infection as
soon as microbiological results are available. This approach
may be reasonable in endemic settings for KPC-Kp but
cannot be generalized to other settings. New rapid diagnos￾tic techniques enabling fast identification of genes coding
for carbapenemase enzymes [36, 37] will be useful to im￾prove this clinical strategy.
We found no differences in 30-day mortality rates
among patients who received colistin-base, CAZ-AVI￾based, or other treatment regimens. However, the
composite endpoint of 30-day mortality or nephrotox￾icity demonstrated a superior risk benefit profile for
CAZ-AVI compared to colistin-containing regimens
(p = 0.01). This is in line with recent reports showing
that treatment-related nephrotoxicity was significantly
higher in patients treated with colistin [38–40].
Furthermore, we were able to identify differences in
mortality according to the site of infection. Patients with
primary bacteremia and those with IAIs had the highest
mortality rates, while patients with CVC-related BSI had
the least mortality (81.8% vs 50% vs 18%, respectively
p = 0.009); a large percentage of patients with primary
bacteremia and IAI received colistin (63.6 and 37.5%,
respectively) and the mortality in patients treated with co￾listin was higher than comparators. Although not
statistically significant, this trend was observed also in

patients with BSI arising from an IAI (64.3% vs 37.5%) and
CVC-related bacteremia (37.5% vs 0%). A recent study
showed that in patients with post-surgical IAI due to
carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii adjunctive
colistin to conventional tigecycline did not yield clinical
benefit but caused higher renal complication and unfavor￾able non-clinical outcomes [41]. It has been also docu￾mented that after the administration of a loading dose of
colistin, concentration increases more slowly in peritoneal
fluid than in plasma [42], and a reduced penetration rate
and a potential inoculum effect of colistin in a difficult-to￾reach site such as the abdominal cavity have been ob￾served [43]. Conversely, despite the small number of cases,
in patients with BSI from the urinary tract we observed a
lower mortality in those who received colistin-containing
regimens compared to other regimens (33.3% vs 100%).
This may be due to a rapid urinary excretion and higher
concentration in the urinary tract of intravenously admin￾istered colistin [44]. Unfortunately, the clinical efficacy of
colistin therapy is difficult to assess because some routine
laboratory methods used for colistin susceptibility testing
(in particular gradient tests) have a poor performance
[45], and is not ever possible to determine if colistin has
appropriate MIC. Thus, reliable microbiological tests and
colistin therapeutic drug monitoring should be considered
to avoid toxicity and potential clinical consequences.
The observational nature of the study and the small
sample size are intrinsic study limitations. Additionally,
rather than the clinical diagnosis of BSI, we used blood
culture collection time as the point from which to assess
timing of appropriate antibiotic therapy, which may intro￾duce a bias in the determination of the timing of appropri￾ate therapy. This bias could potentially have been
exacerbated if delays in obtaining blood cultures occurred
after suspicion of infection. However, the choice of a well￾defined time point allowed us to adopt an objective, stan￾dardized criterion. Although rapid identification methods
were used, some patients received appropriate therapy
after more than 48 h from BSI onset. It can be occurred
because the time to blood culture positivity is variable and
can range from few to several hours (or days). Moreover,
in our institutions, the microbiology laboratories handle
blood cultures 6/7 days weekly, and reporting may be de￾layed during weekend or public holidays; these factors
could explain the prolonged time from blood culture col￾lection to appropriate antibiotic therapy observed in some
patients. Anyway, independently from the potential rea￾sons underlining this delay, the time from blood culture
collection and the appropriate antibiotic therapy was a
factor associated with poor outcome. This finding high￾lights the crucial role of the microbiology laboratory and
the importance of rapid reporting of microbiological re￾sults in the management of critically ill patients. Another
limitation may be represented by the fact that we
considered appropriate an antibiotic therapy if at least one
antibiotic, including tigecycline, displayed in vitro activity.
Considering its pharmacokinetic profile, the efficacy of
tigecycline in patients with BSI due to KPC-Kp is debated
and considering it an appropriate therapy may be ques￾tionable. However, in our study, we used a high dosage in
all cases (100 mg every 12 h) and almost all published
studies considered tigecycline as an evaluable and poten￾tially effective drug [6]. Future studies should assess the
exact role of tigecycline in KPC-Kp bacteremia.
Conclusion
Our study shows that time from blood culture collection
to appropriate therapy is an independent predictor of
30-day mortality in patients with KPC-Kp BSI. Clinicians
should start appropriate antibiotic therapy as soon as
possible, preferably within the first 24 h of blood culture
collection. Treatment strategies allowing the early deliv￾ery of in vitro active antibiotics are urgently needed in
ICU patients at risk of KPC-Kp bacteremia.
