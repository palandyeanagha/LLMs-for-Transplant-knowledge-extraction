Abstract
Interferon is becoming the standard treat￾ment in adults for chronic hepatitis C.
Twenty one children with histologically
proved chronic hepatitis C (10 boys, range
2 5-13 years), who were otherwise healthy,
were enrolled in a randomised controlled
study to test their response to interferon
alfa. Eleven children were treated with
lymphoblastoid interferon alfa (3 million
units/M2) for 12 months; 10 children
received no treatment. All had raised
transaminases and positive antihepatitis
C virus (HCV) antibodies and HCV-RNA.
Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) serum
levels became normal in five (45%) treated
patients after a mean of three weeks
(range 1-6 weeks) and no relapse had
occurred by the end of follow up (30th
month). Only one (10%) untreated patient
had normal ALT serum levels from the
11th until the 30th month. Disappearance
of serum HCV-RNA, persisting through￾out the follow up period, was observed in
the six children (five treated) whose ALT
became normal. Biopsy specimens in
treated patients showed a significant
improvement in Knodell's score (median
(SD) basal 9-0 (2.2); final 2-0 (0.4)).
Interferon treatment was well tolerated in
all. This study confirms the efficacy of
interferon in children with chronic
hepatitis C, not only by restoring normal
ALT serum levels, but also viral clearance
and histological amelioration of liver
inflammation. Contrary to reports in
adults no biochemical and virological
relapses occurred in responder children.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is charac￾terised by a high chronicity rate (about 90%
of infected subjects) and by propensity to
cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.1-5
Although children with chronic hepatitis C do
not have severe clinical and histological find￾ings, spontaneous remission is uncommon.67
It is not known whether the minor histological
lesions in children are related to the shorter
duration of disease or age related host response
to infection.6 Because of its antiviral and
immunomodulatory properties, interferon is a
promising therapeutic agent for chronic
hepatitis C.8 In adults, where the efficacy of
interferon treatment has been well docu￾mented, short duration of disease, young age,
absence of cirrhosis, and mild histological
lesions are considered predictive factors in
response to treatment.9 10 On this basis,
children with chronic hepatitis C should be
ideal candidates for interferon treatment. The
present study was undertaken to evaluate, in a
randomised controlled trial, the efficacy of
lymphoblastoid interferon alfa treatment in
children affected by chronic hepatitis C with￾out underlying chronic systemic diseases.
Patients and methods
Forty five consecutive patients with HCV
infection, aged 1-14 years (27 boys, 18 girls),
attending the liver unit of the department of
paediatrics of the University 'Federico II' of
Naples from January to July 1992, were con￾sidered for inclusion in the trial if they met the
following criteria: age between 2 and 14 years;
anti-HCV antibodies detected by a second
generation enzyme linked immunosorbent
assay (ELISA) and confirmed by a second
generation recombinant immunoblot assay;
raised alanine aminotransferase (ALT) serum
levels for at least six months before
enrolment; histological evidence of chronic
hepatitis; absence of underlying chronic
systemic diseases or other liver diseases; and
no clinical or biochemical evidence of auto￾immunity. Exclusion criteria included a previ￾ous course of antiviral or immunosuppressive
treatment; advanced or decompensated
cirrhosis; presence in the serum of hepatitis B
surface antigen and/or antibodies to HIV.
Twenty one children (10 boys, median age
7-5 years, range 2 5-13 years) met the criteria
and were enrolled in the study. All were
symptom free and none had a history of acute
symptomatic onset of liver disease. On physical
examination, 15 (71%) had mild hepato￾megaly. The study was approved by the
hospital ethics committee, and written parental
consent was obtained. Using computer
generated randomisation tables the patients
were assigned to two groups: 11 (group 1)
received lymphoblastoid interferon alfa for 12
months and 10 (group 2) received no treat￾ment. Enrolled patients' clinical state was eval￾uated monthly during the treatment period,
and thereafter every three months for 18
months. At the same times, the following
investigations were performed: full blood
count, ALT and aspartate aminotransferase,
bilirubin, y-glutamyltransferase, albumin,
total protein, prothrombin time, creatinine,
and serological markers of HCV infection.
HCV-RNA analysis was preformed by poly￾merase chain reaction at enrolment and after

six, 12, 18, 24, and 30 months. Genotyping
was performed and interpreted according to
the method of Okamoto et al II in all patients
using paired serum samples taken at entry and
after 30 months. Furthermore, in the treated
patients, ALT serum levels and full blood
count were monitored weekly for the first two
months of treatment. As both HCV related
chronic liver disease and interferon treatment
may be associated with autoimmunity, cryo￾globulinaemia, and thyroid diseases,12-16 the
children were tested, before enrolment and at
intervals of six months, for antinuclear, anti￾smooth muscle and antiliver-kidney micro￾somal autoantibodies, cryoglobulins, total
thyroxine, free thyroxine, tri-iodothyronine,
free tri-iodothyronine, and thyroid stimulating
hormone.
LIVER BIOPSY STUDIES
All patients had a liver biopsy within the six
months preceding entry. Follow up biopsy
was performed 24 months after enrolment in
treated patients only. For ethical reasons a
second biopsy was not performed in untreated
patients. All biopsy specimens were evalu￾ated, according to the European classification
of chronic hepatitis,17 and graded with
respect to degree of periportal, portal and
lobular inflammation, and fibrosis according
to the Knodell scoring system. 18 Improve￾ment or deterioration were defined as a differ￾ence of at least two points between the total
scores for two biopsy specimens from the
same patient.
TREATMENT SCHEDULE AND DOSE
MODIFICATIONS FOR SIDE EFFECTS
The dose of lymphoblastoid interferon alfa was
3 million units/M2 of body surface subcuta￾neously three times a week for 12 months. The
dose was halved when neutrophil count was
less than 1-5 x109/l and/or platelet count was
less than 80X 1i09/1, and stopped when the neu￾trophil count was less than 1-0X109/l and/or
platelet count less than 50x 109/l. Treatment
was reinstituted in a stepwise fashion, begin￾ning with a maximum of 50% of the last
administered dose. Interferon alfa was sus￾pended if transaminases were more than six
times the upper reference limit or if there was
no reduction of ALT serum levels after six
months of treatment.
DEFINITIONS OF TREATMENT RESPONSE AND
RELAPSE
A biochemical response to treatment was
defined as ALT normalisation occurring
during the treatment and persisting until the
suspension of interferon alfa treatment. A viro￾logical response to treatment was defined as
disappearance of serum HCV-RNA occurring
during the treatment and persisting until the
suspension of interferon alfa treatment.
Patients with persistent or fluctuating hyper￾transaminasaemia were defined as non-respon￾ders. A biochemical relapse was defined as
an increase in the ALT level to more than
1-5 times the upper normal value after a bio￾chemical response, a virological relapse was
defined as the reappearance of serum HCV￾RNA after a virological response.
ASSAYS
Aminotransferase serum concentrations were
evaluated by standard methods. Serological
markers of HCV infection were detected with a
second generation ELISA (ELISA-2, Ortho
Diagnostic Systems) and reactive samples were
further tested by a second generation recom￾binant assay for anti-HCV (RIBA-2, Ortho
Diagnostic Systems). HCV-RNA was detected
by a nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
involving primers deduced from the 5'-non￾coding region of the HCV genome.19 HCV
genotypes were identified by primer specific
reverse transcription PCR based on the HCV
core region. I 1
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Results were expressed as mean (SD), if not
indicated differently. Statistical analysis was
performed with Fisher's exact test, Wilcoxon
signed rank test, Mann-Whitney test, and
Student's t test, when appropriate. A p value
<0 05 was considered significant.
Results
At entry, treated and untreated patients were
comparable for age, sex, route of infection,
duration of disease, and clinical, biochemical,
virological, and histological features (table 1).
Although fluctuations of ALT were observed
in all patients before enrolment, none had
normal levels for longer than two months.
Eight of the 11 treated patients received inter￾feron treatment for 12 months; the mean total
amount of interferon administered was 93 1%
of the scheduled dose (range 81-100%).
Treatment was discontinued during the first
month in a girl because of ALT levels more
than 18 times the upper reference limit and at
the sixth month in two patients who showed
no reduction in ALT. Biochemical response
was observed in five (45%) treated patients
and only in one (10%) untreated patient
(p=0 0936). The normalisation of ALT serum
levels in the five treated patients occurred after
a mean time of three weeks (range 1-6 weeks)
and persisted until the end of follow up (30th
month), while in the untreated patient it
occurred at the 1 1th month and persisted until
the 30th month. A virological response was
observed in the five biochemical responders of
group 1 and persisted throughout follow up.
Among children in group 2, the only patient
whose ALT became normal also showed clear￾ance of serum HCV-RNA from the 18th until
the 30th month. All enrolled patients showed
persistently positive serum anti-HCV without
changes in RIBA-2 pattern. In 16 patients
whose serum HCV-RNA did not clear, HCV
genotype was identical at entry and at the end
of follow up. The figure shows the profile of

SIDE EFFECTS
Soon after the start of treatment, a transient
influenza-like syndrome was observed in all
patients; subsequently, anorexia, asthenia, irri￾tability, headache, and abdominal pain were
the most common observed side effects.
However, interferon treatment was generally
well tolerated and the quality of life did not
deteriorate. Neutropenia requiring tapering of
interferon dose was observed in five patients.
There was no evidence of autoimmunity, cryo￾globulinaemia, and thyroid disorders in any
patient, including the one whose treatment was
suspended because of raised transaminases.
Discussion
The natural history of childhood chronic hepati￾tis C is unknown because of a lack of longitudi￾nal studies with long term follow up. Recently it
has been reported that the disease is silent in
most children67 and, in the short term, few
spontaneously remit.7 The natural history in

adults suggests that it may evolve insidiously to
cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.2 5 20 In
adults interferon alfa may induce a sustained
biochemical and virological response associated
with amelioration of liver inflammation.8 Little
information is available about the efficacy ofthis
treatment in childhood. Ruiz-Moreno et al in a
pilot uncontrolled study demonstrated the
efficacy of interferon alfa in children chronically
infected by HCV,21 but serological features of
the studied patients were not representative of
children affected by chronic hepatitis C. In fact,
seven of the 12 studied patients were HCV￾RNA positive but anti-HCV negative. This
pattern is not typical of immunocompetent
patients and indicates underlying immune
defects.22 23 Furthermore, in this study serum
ALT in anti-HCV negative/HCV-RNA positive
patients were characterised by significant peaks
with respect to the basal values until the third
month of treatment. This pattern of serum ALT
has never been described in chronically HCV
infected patients during interferon treatment.24
Therefore, despite the small number ofpatients,
our study represents the first controlled trial of
interferon in children affected by chronic
hepatitis C without underlying chronic systemic
disease. Although differences in biochemical
and virological response between treated

and untreated children were not statistically
significant, interferon alfa treatment produced a
very early and striking reduction of serum ALT
in responders, sustained clearance of serum
HCV-RNA and an impressive improvement in
liver histology. Although long term outcome of
these patients is uncertain, it seems reasonable
to assume that - at least in responders - inter￾feron treatment may reduce the rate of late
complications of HCV infection.
Ideally, a significant effect on morbidity and
mortality related to HCV infection would be the
best determinant of a beneficial effect of inter￾feron.24 But because of the slowly progressive
nature of HCV infection, using long term out￾come as an end point for response is not practi￾cal. At present, aminotransferase serum levels
and virological markers are used to judge the
response to treatment.24 Serum ALT alone may
be misleading because of the fluctuations
described in natural history of HCV infec￾tion,6 7 and the marked variability of individual
levels in enrolled patients. We believe it is
important to consider the duration of the peri￾ods in which serum ALT remains normal. In
our responders, normal ALT was sustained
until the end of follow up. This has not been
observed previously. In addition there was viro￾logical and histological response. Viral clearance
is probably the major goal for interferon treat￾ment and may explain also the lack of relapse

observed in our patients during an 18 month
follow up after discontinuation of treatment. In
the present study we found neither discrepancy
between biochemical and virological response
nor a high relapse rate as observed in adults.25 26
This sustained remission could be due to less
heterogeneous viral populations, with a lower
rate of mutants, depending on a shorter dura￾tion of disease but might be a function of the
small number of studied patients. It has been
suggested that better results are obtained by
extending the duration of interferon treat￾ment.27 Our findings confirm the efficacy of
schedules characterised by at least 12 months of
treatment. Recent investigations have deter￾mined that HCV genotype was the most
important factor in predicting interferon
response.28 Because of the small number of
enrolled patients, we were not able to predict
which factors would select HCV infected
children candidates for treatment with inter￾feron alfa; however, it is noteworthy that
responders regained normal aminotransferase
serum levels in the first two months. Therefore,
if no such early response is observed treatment
might be reasonably suspended.
Finally, in evaluating the efficacy of inter￾feron treatment in childhood, the cost-benefit
ratio has to be considered. Interferon is charac￾terised by high costs in terms of drugs, in
patient care, other medical expenses, and
parental time lost from work. Furthermore,
long term complications of interferon treat￾ment are not clear. However, considering the
frequency of viral clearance and histological
activity improvement, lack of relapse, and of
serious adverse effects, against the risk of
cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, we
consider interferon alfa should be considered
in all children affected by chronic hepatitis C.
Further studies are needed with larger number
of patients and more careful evaluation of
HCV-RNA in all known sites of virus replica￾tion to better define clearance and/or neutrali￾sation of HCV by the host immune system.
