Abstract
Background: Advanced chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) often leads to hospitalisation and invasive
aspergillosis (IA) is a serious complication. Aspergillus sensitisation may worsen symptoms in COPD.
Methods: We identified published papers between January 2000 and May 2019 with > 50 subjects and GOLD
criteria for grade II, III or IV (FEV1/FVC < 70% and FEV1 < 80%) using standardised criteria in multiple countries, to re￾estimate the prevalence of COPD. Hospitalised COPD patients develop IA in 1.3–3.9%, based on positive cultures of
Aspergillus spp. and radiological findings. Given limited data on per-patient annual hospitalisation rates, we assumed
a conservative 10.5% estimate. Annual IA mortality in COPD was estimated using the literature rates of 43–72%. A
separate literature search assessed the impact of Aspergillus sensitisation on severity of COPD (by FEV1).
Results: We re-estimated the global prevalence of COPD GOLD stages II-IV at 552,300,599 people (7.39% of the
population) with 339,206,893 (8.58%) in Asia, 85,278,783 (8.52%) in the Americas, 64,298,051 (5.37%) in Africa,
59,484,329 (7.77%) in Europe and 4,032,543 (10.86%) in Oceania. An estimated 57,991,563 (10.5%) people with COPD
are admitted to hospital annually and of these 753,073 (1.3%) – 2,272,322 (3.9%) develop IA and 540,451–977,082
deaths are predicted annually. Aspergillus sensitisation prevalence in COPD was 13.6% (7.0–18.3%) and not related to
lower predicted FEV1% (P > 0.05).
Conclusions: The prevalence of COPD is much higher than previously estimated. Overall COPD mortality may be
higher than estimated and IA probably contributes to many deaths. Improved rapid diagnosis of IA using culture
and non-culture based techniques is required in COPD hospital admissions to reduce mortality.

Background
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the
most prevalent non-communicable disease of the lungs. It
is both preventable and treatable but usually progressive
and irreversible [1] with the majority of deaths from
COPD occurring in less-developed countries [2]. An
ageing population has led to a relative increase in the bur￾den of COPD morbidity and mortality across the world
over recent years which has focused the spotlight on
COPD as a significant global health concern [2]. The
strongest risk factor for the development of airflow limita￾tion is smoking and indoor exposure to biomass [3]; other
factors include family history, genetics including alpha-1-
antitrypsin deficiency, age, education, tuberculosis, and
occupational exposures [4]. Estimates for the prevalence
of the disease vary considerably across the globe [5].
Bacteria and viruses are a major cause of COPD exac￾erbations [6] whereas the role of fungi is less well under￾stood. Most pulmonary fungal infections are caused by
members of genus Aspergillus [7]. Aspergilli are

ubiquitous soil-dwelling fungi that have the ability to
cause a range of pulmonary conditions including inva￾sive aspergillosis (IA), chronic pulmonary aspergillosis
(CPA) including aspergilloma, hypersensitivity pneu￾monitis, and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis
(ABPA) [8]. IA is almost always fatal if not identified
and treated early [9]. COPD is one of many underlying
risk factors for IA, including neutropenia, liver disease,
diabetes mellitus, AIDS, those on immunosuppressive
treatment, such as solid and haematopoietic stem cell
transplant recipients [9–12]. Prior estimates of the an￾nual global incidence of IA range upwards from 200,000
[9], but difficulties in the precise diagnosis of IA in
COPD patients has restrained efforts to include this
group in the estimates [10].
One of the aims of this study was to provide global
and individual country estimates for the annual number
of cases of IA in COPD patients and likely associated
mortality. In addition, we wanted to assess whether As￾pergillus sensitisation contributes to the severity of
COPD as recent publications have noted that COPD pa￾tients with allergic sensitisation to Aspergillus fumigatus
experience more symptoms and exacerbations [13], and
multiple studies have demonstrated a correlation be￾tween asthma severity and sensitisation to Aspergillus
specifically [14, 15].
Methods
A systematic review of published literature on PubMed
was conducted to ascertain country estimates for 1)
COPD prevalence (GOLD grade II-IV), 2) COPD annual
hospitalisation rates, and 3) annual cases of IA in COPD
patients. Countries included in this review were those
with populations over one million, as guided by UN
2015 data [16]. The methodology used in this study is
summarised in Additional file 1.
COPD prevalence data collation
Data were initially collected from three large studies:
Burden of Obstructive Lung Disease (BOLD), Proyecto
Latinoamericano de Investigacion en Obstruccion Pul￾monar (PLATINO) and BREATHE to provide estimates
on COPD prevalence, [3, 17, 18]. For countries not in￾cluded in these studies, a structured literature search
and review was conducted to identify other individual
country studies to ascertain their estimated prevalence
of COPD (Additional file 1). For countries where data
was either unavailable or unreliable (see exclusion cri￾teria detailed in Additional file 1), COPD prevalence es￾timates from neighbouring countries (including
countries with BOLD and PLATINO sites) were as￾sumed (Additional file 1).
We pritoritized studies where similar methodologies
had been applied at multiple sites. Studies that adopted
GOLD criteria were used preferentially; however, a few
studies (Rwanda, Estonia and Russia) used lower limit of
normal for FEV1/FVC (LLN) to diagnose COPD [19].
Inclusion criteria were:
Studies published between January 2000 and May 2019;
Studies with a sample size > 50 people.
Ssudies with spirometric data were prioritised - use of
GOLD criteria to diagnose COPD with spirometry
grade II, III or IV (FEV1/FVC < 70% and FEV1 < 80%)
or if unavailable then LNN
Exclusion criteria:
Studies estimating prevalence to be close to or 0%;
Studies conducted in specific patient groups; e.g., in
acutely unwell patients only.
COPD hospitalisation data collation
Limited data were available for individual countries on
their annual rates of COPD-related hospitalisations. The
methodology used, similar to that for COPD prevalence
data, is summarised in Additional file 1. As many coun￾tries did not have published data for hospitalisations, a
conservative 10.5% estimate was assumed. This was
based on the data from studies in Algeria which have es￾timated COPD hospitalisation rates at 10.5% [18], not
different from the average rate from other studies. The
data is therefore more reflective of how many people are
admitted, rather than a potentially overestimated figure
of how many hospitalisations occur, as it is common for
COPD patients to experience more than one exacerba￾tion a year [20].
Sensitisation systematic review
A systematic review of the prevalence of Aspergillus sen￾sitisation in patients with COPD, and the difference in
lung function between sensitised and non-sensitised pa￾tients was also conducted. The methodological details
using the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational
Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) methods [21] are de￾scribed in Supplementary data. The data extracted were:
1) Authors, publication year, study design 2) Sample size
3) Population characteristics (age/gender) 4) Study loca￾tion 5) Method of sensitisation assessment 6) Percentage
of sample sensitised to Aspergillus 7) Lung function of
sensitised and non-sensitised patients (FEV1 as a percentage
of predicted). The flow-chart in Additional file 2: Supple￾mentary Figure S1 describes the study selection.
Weighted averages and weighted standard deviations
were computed to compare lung function between sensi￾tised and non-sensitised patients.

Invasive aspergillosis data collection
With regards to the incidence of IA in COPD, propor￾tions of the hospitalization estimates from the only four
studies are published, from China and Spain, were used
to provide an estimated range for each country. The
Spanish study estimated 1.3% of COPD hospitalisations
to have IA in the last year of their survey, and the later
Chinese study estimated 3.9% [10, 20]; the earlier Chin￾ese study estimated 1.9–2.7% [22], in the middle of our
range. Their respective mortality rates (71.7 and 43.9%
respectively) were also applied to estimate deaths from
IA in COPD [10, 20] the earlier study from China had
an 80% mortality, but as two patients were excluded
from this figure, we elected to use the 71.7% rate as our
upper bound of mortality. The most recent study ap￾peared to have a selective admissions policy and was ex￾cluded on these grounds [23].
Results
Overall, COPD prevalence and associated hospitalisation
rates, and data for IA prevalence and associated mortal￾ity in COPD populations, were estimated for 157 coun￾tries globally. Summary estimates are shown in Table 1
and by country in supplementary Table 1 and show sig￾nificant variability.
Prevalence
The global prevalence of COPD GOLD stages II-IV is
estimated at 552,300,599 people (7.39% of the popula￾tion) with 339,206,893 (8.58%) in Asia, 85,278,783
(8.52%) in the Americas, 64,298,051 (5.37%) in Africa,
59,484,329 (7.77%) in Europe and 4,032,543 (10.86%) in
Oceania. China and India account for over 82.7 million
(5.12% of the Chinese population) and 93.9 million
(7.10% of the Indian population) respectively of the glo￾bal COPD population. Additional file 2 illustrates how
the prevalence of COPD varies greatly across the globe.
The lowest prevalence of COPD is documented in Peru
(1.78%) and only Morocco, Angola, Cameroon, Chad,
Republic of Congo, Democratic Republic of Congo,
Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Colombia and United Arab
Emirates have estimated COPD prevalence below 3% of
the population. The highest prevalences were found in
South Africa and the USA by the BOLD study, 19.1 and
14.3% respectively [3], followed by Trinidad and Tobago,
Iraq and Denmark (with 14.1, 13.5 and 12.7% respect￾ively). Some of the lowest results were from countries
included in the BREATHE study: the United Arab Emir￾ates and Morocco, with 1.9, and 2.2% respectively [18];
in Pakistan COPD prevalence was estimated at 2.1% in
the BREATHE study but has since been updated with
data from Karachi to 13.8% [24], throwing these very
low rates into question.
Hospitalisation
An estimated 57,991,563 people with COPD are admit￾ted to hospital annually. There are more admissions than
this because the mean number of admissions per year
for those admitted is often > 1, albeit variable. The rates
of admission vary by country, but in most studies it is
not clear if these are admission numbers or individuals.
Aspergillus sensitisation
We identified 122 articles via systematic search and an
additional three were identified manually (Additional file
2: Supplementary Figure S1). After 27 duplicates were

removed, the remaining 98 were screened by title and
abstract; of these papers, 86 were excluded and 12 full
text articles were assessed for eligibility and 5 were
deemed suitable for inclusion [25–29]. These five papers
describe 1028 patients with COPD, 720 (70%) male with
a mean age of 68.8 years (Table 2). Two of the studies
were located in Europe, one in Latin America, one in
Southern Asia and one in Eastern Asia.
We estimate that the total global population of
COPD patients who are sensitised to Aspergillus is
just over 75 million. Serum IgE was the most com￾mon method to assess the prevalence of Aspergillus
sensitisation. The highest prevalence of sensitisation
was in Europe based on studies located in Belgium
and the United Kingdom (Table 3). In Belgium, Ever￾aerts et al. reported the highest prevalence of 18.3%
sensitised to Aspergillus [26]. In contrast, Le Pape
et al. in Colombia found the lowest prevalence at
7.9% [29]. The weighted average of sensitisation to
Aspergillus across all studies was 13.6%. The max￾imum proportion of healthy controls (n = 322) sensi￾tised to Aspergillus was 4% (Table 4). The FEV1 was
2.5% lower in COPD patients sensitised to Aspergillus
than non-sensitised patients (P-value = 0.57) (Table 4).
Invasive Aspergillosis
There are only three studies documenting the incidence
of IA in those admitted to hospital [10, 20, 22]. All are
based primarily on sputum culture positive for Aspergil￾lus spp. with supportive radiological findings and usually
both a failure to respond to antibiotics and a progressive
course. One study included Aspergillus antigen and beta
1,3-D-glucan serum biomarkers [22]. These three studies
provided the upper and lower bounds of our estimates
for IA - 753,073 - 2,272,000 annual cases. As shown in
Table 1, the number affected by continent were variable
and vary from a low of 14.8/100,000 in Oceania to a high
of 34.9/100,000 in the Americas. Annual incidence vary
from a low of 1.77 in Panama to 26.07/100,000 in South
Africa and countries neighbouring South Africa
(Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho and Namibia) (Additional
file 2) using the lower estimate of 1.3% affected. The
higher estimate of 3.9% of COPD hospitalisations af￾fected increases the annual incidence to 5.32 to 78.21/
100,000.
There are no data published directly estimating the
prevalence of CPA complicating COPD, even though
about 33% of CPA patients have COPD as an underlying
diagnosis, 9% as the primary underlying pulmonary dis￾order [30]. One recent 12-year retrospective inpatient
study from Caruña, Spain which used positive cultures
as the enrolment criteria found 68 patients with IA and
7 with CPA [31]. If this ratio pertains in other countries,
then CPA complicating COPD would have an inpatient
incidence of 76,000 – 272,000. These patients might be
included in the overall IA group, as it is likely that this
chronic subset of aspergillosis cases was not separated
out in the IA COPD studies [10, 20]. Another selective
study in China of 36 cases separated them into 25 with
IA and 11 with CPA [23]. As most patients with CPA
are diagnosed and managed as outpatients, the preva￾lence of CPA complicating COPD is probably 4-10 times
greater than this.
The untreated mortality of invasive aspergillosis is
generally thought to be about 100% but is not carefully
documented in COPD patients because of the difficulties
in establishing the diagnosis early in the course of dis￾ease [22]. We took a conservative view of the likely mor￾tality, by using the rates in the two papers where the
diagnosis was actively sought and antifungal treatment
usually administered, which is probably not the case in
most centres. Applying these mortality rates of 44–72%,
540,451–977,082 deaths from IA in hospitalised COPD
patients are predicted annually.
Discussion
There has not been a global COPD prevalence review
conducted based on spirometry and standardised assess￾ments for more than a decade, until this year, published
as this was paper was being reviewed [32]. The results

from our review of the global data estimate there to be
551,792,354 individuals suffering with COPD, the major￾ity of whom are classed as GOLD moderate to severe.
Given that the most recent global estimate for COPD
prevalence was 251 million [33], now up to 300 million
according to the Global Burden of Disease consortium
[32], our estimate is much higher even excluding coun￾tries with populations under 1 million and excluding
GOLD stage I data. Our estimate is dwarfed by another
recent systematic review and meta-analysis based on 60
papers and 128,000 patients – a global prevalence of
12.1% (approximately 909 million) [34]. These much
higher prevalence figures are not surprising, with under￾diagnosis of COPD being one of the major issues facing
the management of the disease. During the EPI-SCAN
study, Miravitlles et al. found 73% of the patients in their
trial with non-reversible airflow obstruction characteris￾tic of COPD did not have a diagnosis before the study
[35]. Furthermore, it has been found that this under￾diagnosis appears to affect women disproportionately
[36]. In order to minimise the effect of under-diagnosis
in our estimate we only used internationally accepted
spirometry criteria to define COPD, with the exception
of a small number of studies using alternative justified
methodology. In contrast, our estimate for the global
prevalence of COPD at 8.3% is lower than the estimate
of 8.9% made in a review by Halbert et al [37]; this is the
only review of global COPD prevalence defined by spir￾ometry we could identify. Over 20% of the studies in￾cluded by Halbert et al. in their analysis defined COPD
as GOLD stage I or above (FEV1/FVC < 0.7), this could
contribute to their higher estimate of prevalence as we
only included GOLD stage II or above in our analysis.
We chose to exclude GOLD stage I from our review be￾cause using this to define COPD has been shown to
over-diagnose elderly patients [38], and there is greater
realisation of the variable size of lungs as a result of
childhood pollution and other factors interfering with
normal lung development [39]. We opted to select stud￾ies defining COPD by GOLD stage II-IV over LLN cri￾teria to increase consistency within our review, because
the GOLD criteria are more commonly used to define
COPD in epidemiology studies, and because using LLN
criteria may underdiagnose patients [40].
There are some limitations to the methodology used
for calculating prevalence. We did use whole population
prevalence, rather than restricting to only those over 40
years of age, as increasing reports of young people with
COPD are emerging. As countries with populations less
than 1 million were not included, the true total COPD
prevalence globally may be slightly higher. The exclusion
of GOLD stage I COPD under-estimates mild COPD.
We adopted this stance partly because many patients
with GOLD stage I COPD (FEV1 ≥ 80%) are undiag￾nosed [41] and country data are probably unreliable and
under-representative. A good example is data from
United Arab Emirates, Pakistan and Morocco, with
COPD prevalence of 1.9%, 2.1% and 2.2%, respectively
[42]. Given the high rates of smoking in these countries
[43], we do not consider these prevalence rates to be re￾flective of their true COPD prevalence. The prevalence
used for over half the countries included in our review
was based on assumptions taken from other countries.
Further data are required, in particular for Sub-Saharan
Africa and certain parts of Europe, also recognized by
Halbert et al [37]. A more recent systematic review ana￾lysing the burden of COPD in Latin America and the
Caribbean was only able to identify one paper in the
Caribbean region [44].
Biomass fuels and mining are also causative factors in
the onset of reduced lung function and progression of
COPD [45, 46]. A study in Eastern Europe highlighted a
past medical history of pneumonia or tuberculosis (TB)
as additional risk factors for the development of COPD
[47]. In areas where TB is more prevalent, such as India
(which accounted for 24% of total TB cases in 2016 [48])
and South Africa, this could be a causative factor for a
higher prevalence of COPD. In 2019, 62% of cases of TB
were in South-East Asia and the Western Pacific [48],

Table 5 Hospitalisation data by country collated from our systematic literature review. The BREATHE study [18, 42] and Foo et al [59]
documented the incidence of hospitalisations per patient, whereas other studies [45, 63] do not clarify whether the figures reflect
total number of hospitalisations annually (a patient can have multiple exacerbations a year requiring admission, dependent on their
stage of disease), or per patient. A conservative estimate of 10.5%, based on the BREATHE study’s figure for Algeria was used to
calculate average hospitalisation rates for all countries

which could explain why the results of this study showed
high prevalence of COPD in Asia.
Life expectancy is another factor influencing COPD
prevalence; countries with lower life expectancies, such as
in Sub-Saharan Africa [49], may have a lower prevalence for
moderate to severe COPD due to patients dying from other
causes before their COPD can progress. There is limited
published data available for the majority of Sub-Saharan
Africa and so it is difficult to highlight a specific country
from the results to illustrate this. Further studies are needed
to ascertain the prevalence of COPD in this region.
The BREATHE study was one of the large studies used
initially to provide COPD prevalence estimates for a num￾ber of countries in the Middle East and North Africa. The
study used an epidemiological survey to diagnose COPD
and estimate its prevalence [18, 42], therefore, unlike the
rest of the data included in this review, spirometry was
not used as a diagnostic tool. The BREATHE study was
included given that it provided data for countries in re￾gions where limited data was available, and could there￾fore also be used as estimates for other neighbouring
countries in Africa and the Middle East. The study pro￾vides a sound rationale for using the epidemiological sur￾vey that COPD is often not diagnosed until it is clinically
apparent and moderately advanced, however patients may
still be symptomatic, with an impact on quality of life [11].
Reviewing the prevalence figures, they appear to be very
conservative, such as a 1.90% prevalence for the United
Arab Emirates, where tobacco use is self-reported in 36%
of the male population [50].
COPD hospitalisation rates
Due to wide range of data available for individual country
hospitalisation rates for COPD (Table 5), we applied a
conservative figure of 10.5% to each country’s COPD fig￾ures. In our systematic review, we sought per patient an￾nual rates, rather than the total number of annual COPD
hospitalisations that are probably higher. The BREATHE
study [18, 42] and Foo et al [59] documented the inci￾dence of hospitalisations per patient, whereas studies con￾ducted by Zhu et al [45] and Mares et al [63] are unclear
whether the figures reflect total number of hospitalisations
annually or per patient. We did not interrogate individual
country databases. There are several country-specific fac￾tors that could feed into hospitalisation rates, including
access to healthcare and differences in healthcare systems.
In developing countries where resource may be limited or
a cost is involved in seeing a healthcare professional, hos￾pitalisation rates will be lower than industrialised coun￾tries [48]. Our conservative estimate of over 57 million
people admitted to hospital comprises 14% of the global
number of 421 million hospital admissions in 2009 [51]
and is about 6 times more than influenza as estimated in
2017 [52], likely with some duplication. However, there
remains much uncertainty about this number of
hospitalisations.
Aspergillus sensitisation
Early indicators were that Aspergillus sensitization would
reduce FEV1 and therefore impact on the severity of
COPD, but overall this was not the case - only 2.5%
lower and not statistically significant. This contrasts with
asthma in adults [53], cystic fibrosis [54] and tubercu￾losis [55], where Aspergillus sensitisation is associated
with worse lung function, for mechanistic reasons that
are not well exemplified. The subgroup of COPD pa￾tients with asthma needs more study however, as anti￾fungal therapy of severe asthma with fungal sensitisation
improves symptoms [56]. Further, COPD patients with
fungal sensitisation exhibit greater eosinophilia, which
could alter therapy [57]. A recent paper links fungal, and
especially Aspergillus, sensitisation to increased exacer￾bations of COPD [65].
Invasive aspergillosis
Due to the limited published data for IA in the context
of COPD, it is challenging to provide an accurate esti￾mate on an individual country basis. Assumptions of IA
rates in COPD have been made based on the large stud￾ies from China and Spain [10, 20]; however, several fac￾tors can influence these figures, including the severity of
COPD. Studies have shown that infection is more com￾mon in the more severe stages, III and IV, of COPD [10,
44, 58]. Therefore, the rates of IA will be influenced by
the proportion of the patients with more severe COPD,
probably by corticosteroid prescribing practice and pos￾sibly by exposure to Aspergillus. More studies focused
specifically on cases of IA in specific country populations
are necessary to build a more accurate picture of the risk
associated with COPD and invasive fungal disease. The
figures from Spain and China do, however, provide an
indication of the overall potential risk of those with
COPD and the associated likelihood of contracting a
fungal infection. From these three studies, we have esti￾mated the global number of cases of IA in COPD popu￾lations to be between 760,017 – 2,272,322. This is
substantially higher than the previously estimated
200,000 cases of IA per year (of all causes, not solely
COPD) [9]. These data, which need confirmation, are
important to raise awareness in healthcare systems to in￾clude invasive fungal infection as a differential diagnosis
in COPD patients presenting with an exacerbation, and
to exclude/treat appropriately and quickly and thence
lower attributable mortality, which is otherwise high [9,
10, 20]. The high number if IA cases in COPD may sur￾prise clinicians but should perhaps underscore the need
to look for more than the usual infection culprits (i.e. H.
influenzae) in COPD exacerbations. Often, more intense
Hammond et al. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2020) 20:241 Page 7 of 10

infection diagnostics and imaging beyond an ordinary
chest x-ray will be required, although neither serum as￾says for galactomannan (Aspergillus antigen) nor beta 1,
3-D-glucan are satisfactory with positive predictive
values of 21.1% and 8.7% respectively although high
negative predictive values of >99.5% [22]. Aspergillus
antibody detection in serum and molecular and culture
testing of respiratory samples may be optimal, but needs
thorough evaluation [7].
The range of mortality associated with IA in COPD
populations was calculated to be between 544,932–976,187
deaths annually. Deaths from COPD ranked 10th among
all causes of death in 2015, 4th among countries with a
middle Socio-Demographic Index, with an estimated 3,
188,000 deaths [58]. Lower respiratory infections were
thought to have lead to 2,376,700 deaths. Our estimate of
deaths from IA are remarkably high given these estimates
and need validation with additional epidemiology studies.
In one sense they are conservative, as they assume the
diagnosis of IA is made and treatment given. Middle￾income countries are hit particularly hard by COPD
deaths; therefore improved epidemiological data in these
areas would facilitate governments and healthcare organi￾sations making better informed decisions to better reduce
premature deaths.
Conclusion
In conclusion, the global burden of COPD is high,
and although variable, likely to be a much larger glo￾bal health problem than previously realised. Our
study highlights the need for healthcare professionals
to be aware of the possible risk of IA in their pa￾tients, and associated mortality, to identify and treat
patients sooner, lowering mortality. We hope that this
report will encourage further research into COPD
epidemiology and the relationship between Aspergillus
infection and COPD.
