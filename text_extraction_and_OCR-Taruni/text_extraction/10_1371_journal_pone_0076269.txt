Abstract
Background: Clostridium difficile is an anaerobic, spore-forming bacterium that is the most common cause of
healthcare-associated diarrhea in developed countries. A significant proportion of patients receiving oral vancomycin
or metronidazole for treatment of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) develop recurrences. However, the period of
vulnerability to re-establishment of colonization by C. difficile after therapy is not well defined.
Principal Findings: In a prospective study of CDI patients, we demonstrated that most vancomycin-treated patients
maintained inhibitory concentrations of vancomycin in stool for 4 to 5 days after therapy, whereas metronidazole was
only detectable during therapy. From the time of elimination of the antibiotics to 14 to 21 days after therapy, a
majority of stool suspensions supported growth of C. difficile and deep 16S rRNA sequencing demonstrated
persistent marked alteration of the indigenous microbiota. By 21 to 28 days after completion of CDI treatment, a
majority of stool suspensions inhibited growth of C. difficile and there was evidence of some recovery of the
microbiota.
Conclusions: These data demonstrate that there is a vulnerable period for re-establishment of C. difficile
colonization after CDI treatment that begins within a few days after discontinuation of treatment and extends for
about 3 weeks in most patients.

Introduction
Clostridium difficile is the most important cause of
healthcare-associated diarrhea in developed countries [1]. Oral
vancomycin and metronidazole are the agents most often used
to treat Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) [1]. These antibiotics
are effective in suppressing C. difficile, but they are
nonselective agents that also cause significant disruption of the
indigenous microbiota of the colon [2-4]. For example, oral
vancomycin achieves high concentrations in the intestinal tract,
resulting in suppression of anaerobic organisms, including
Bacteroides spp. [4,5]. Such disruption of the indigenous
microbiota may predispose patients to recurrent CDI due to
regrowth of the original infecting C. difficile strains or
acquisition of new strains [1]. Although it is known that
recurrences may occur days to weeks after completion of CDI
therapy, the period of vulnerability to re-establishment of
colonization by C. difficile after therapy is not well defined. In
theory, this period will extend from the time vancomycin or
metronidazole levels reach subinhibitory concentrations in the
colon to the time when the intestinal microbiota recovers
sufficiently to inhibit C. difficile growth. A better understanding
of the timing of the vulnerable period after CDI therapy is
needed for the design of interventions to reduce recurrences.
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 October 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 10 | e76269

For example, administration of biotherapeutic agents such as
nontoxigenic C. difficile could be targeted to coincide with the
vulnerable period for re-establishment of colonization [6].
Limited information is available regarding the duration of
excretion of vancomycin and metronidazole in stool after
treatment. Edlund et al. [4] administered oral vancomycin 0.5
gram/day for 7 days to healthy volunteers; the mean
concentration of vancomycin in stool after 7 days of treatment
was 520 + 197 µg/g, but only 1 of 10 subjects had high levels
of vancomycin in stool 1 week after discontinuation of
treatment (i.e., 135 µg/g). Metronidazole achieved much lower
concentrations in stool of CDI patients during therapy (mean +
SD, 9.3 + 7.5 µg/g), and levels became undetectable as
diarrhea resolved during treatment [7].
Here, we examined the duration of excretion of vancomycin
and metronidazole in stool after treatment of CDI and
evaluated the period of vulnerability to re-establishment of
colonization by C. difficile. Because patients with CDI are often
elderly and have received multiple prior courses of broad￾spectrum antibiotics, we hypothesized that they may have a
prolonged period of vulnerability to C. difficile colonization after
oral vancomycin or oral metronidazole treatment.
Materials and Methods
Ethics Statement
The Institutional Review Board of the Cleveland Veterans
Affairs Medical Center approved the study protocol. C. difficile
strains isolated from patients were collected from the Cleveland
VA Medical Center. Written informed consent was obtained
from all subjects.
C. difficile Strains
One epidemic North American pulsed-field gel
electrophoresis type 1 (NAP1) /polymerase chain reaction
ribotype 027 strain (VA 17) and one nonepidemic strain (VA 6)
were tested in an in vitro assay of colonization resistance. Both
strains were cultured from patients with CDI at the Cleveland
VA Medical Center.
Setting and Study Design
We performed an 8-month prospective, observational study
of patients treated for CDI with oral metronidazole or
vancomycin at the Cleveland VA Medical Center. Patients
receiving therapy for multiple recurrences or for severe,
complicated CDI as defined by Cohen et al. [1] (i.e.,
hypotension or shock, ileus, megacolon) were excluded, but
patients with severe but uncomplicated CDI were not. Severe
CDI was defined as a case in which the white blood cell count
was >15,000 cells/µl and/or the creatinine was increased 1.5 or
more times the baseline level [1]. During the study, diagnostic
testing for CDI was performed using enzyme immunoassay
(EIA) for glutamate dehydrogenase (Wampole C. diff Chek-60,
Inverness Medical, Princeton, NJ) as an initial screen with a
commercial PCR test for toxin B genes (Becton Dickinson,
Cockeysville, MD) for confirmation. The laboratory rejected
formed stool samples. The choice of therapy for CDI was made
by the physicians caring for the patients. Information regarding
the demographic characteristics, coexisting illnesses, and
antibiotic therapy was obtained through standardized chart
review. The stool sample used for diagnosis of CDI was
collected from the clinical microbiology laboratory and
additional stool samples were collected every 3-4 days during
treatment and for up to 4 weeks after treatment while the
patients were hospitalized.
Microbiology and Molecular Typing
The presence of C. difficile in stool samples was measured
by plating serially-diluted samples on C. difficile Brucella agar
(CDBA) as previously described [8]. Plates were incubated for
48 hours at 37 °C in the anaerobic chamber. Colonies were
confirmed to be C. difficile on the basis of typical odor and
appearance of colonies and by a positive reaction using C.
difficile latex agglutination (Microgen Bioproducts, Camberly,
UK). Isolates from the highest dilution with growth were tested
for in-vitro cytoxin production using C. difficile Tox A/B II
(Wampole Laboratories); isolates that did not produce toxin
were excluded from the analysis.
Stool isolates were subjected to molecular typing to
determine the prevalence of epidemic North American pulsed￾field gel electrophoresis type 1 (NAP1) strains. Crude DNA was
extracted from C. difficile isolates using QIAamp DNA Mini Kit
(Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-ribotyping was
used to genotype C. difficile isolates [9]. PCR was performed to
amplify one of the genes for binary toxin (cdtB) using the
methods of Terhes et al [10]. For each assay, a known NAP1
strain was used as a positive control and American Type
Culture Collection (ATCC) C. difficile 9689 was used as a
negative control.
Measurement of Drug Concentrations in Stool
For vancomycin-treated patients, the concentration of
vancomycin in stool samples was measured using an AxSym II
fluorescence polarization immunoassay, a standard assay
used by clinical Pathology Laboratories for measurement of
vancomycin in serum samples. The assay was modified for
stool samples by including an extraction of the sample in dilute
ammonia to prevent nonspecific binding of vancomycin to
protein in the stool [11]. The limit of detection of the assay was
2 µg of vancomycin per mL. For metronidazole-treated
patients, the concentration of metronidazole in stool was
measured using a bioassay with Clostridium perfringens as the
indicator organism [12]. For the metronidazole assay, samples
from patients receiving concurrent systemic antibiotics for
indications other than CDI were excluded. The limit of detection
of the assay was 0.5 µg of metronidazole per gm of stool.
In vitro Assay of Colonization Resistance
To assess functional recovery of the ability of the microbiota
to inhibit C. difficile (i.e., provide colonization resistance) after
vancomycin or metronidazole treatment, we used a
modification of the in vitro assay of colonization resistance
developed by Borriello and Barclay [13]. One epidemic NAP1
strain (VA 17) and one nonepidemic strain (VA 6) were tested.

PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 October 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 10 | e76269

Fresh stool samples were homogenized in a 1:1 dilution of pre￾reduced sterile water and inoculated with 104 colony-forming
units (CFU) of vegetative C. difficile inside an anaerobic
chamber (Coy Laboratories, Grass Lake, MI). Samples from
patients receiving concurrent systemic antibiotics for
indications other than CDI and samples with detectable levels
of C. difficile prior to the inoculation of vegetative C. difficile
were excluded. The samples were incubated at 37 °C for 24
hours and then serially-diluted and plated on CDBA plates to
determine the concentration of C. difficile. Loss of colonization
resistance was defined as >1 log10CFU increase in the C.
difficile concentration. In addition to the microbiota, residual
metronidazole or vancomycin in stool samples could suppress
growth of inoculated C. difficile; therefore, growth of the C.
difficile isolates was concurrently assessed in sterile filtrates of
the stool suspensions. The filtrates were produced by
centrifuging the suspensions at 10,000 rpm for 10 minutes,
followed by filtering the supernatant through a 0.22 µm filter.
Analysis of Stool Microbiota Using Deep 16S rRNA
Sequencing
Deep 16SrRNA sequencing was performed on stool
specimens from a subset of vancomycin-treated patients with
samples available before, during, and after CDI therapy who
did not receive concomitant non-CDI antibiotics during or after
CDI therapy. DNA was extracted from fecal samples using
FastDNA®
 Spin Kit (MP Biomedicals) utilizing two mechanical
lysis cycles in FastPrep®
 Instrument (MP Biomedicals) at speed
6.0 for 40 seconds. Extracted DNA was then used for library
construction. Two sets of primers were designed (Table 1). In
set 1, the sequence of V6 universal primers was modified by
adding barcodes of 4 to 6 nucleotides, to allow for multiplexing,
and the Illumina paired-end sequencing adapters as previously
described [14]. In total, 12 different barcodes were generated
for each end. Set 2 was designed to have the Illumina paired￾end sequencing adapter and the flow-cell adapters.
Illumina Library Construction
The V6 hypervariable region of 16S rRNA was PCR￾amplified from extracted DNA in two steps as described by
Arthur et al. [14]. Briefly, step 1 used set 1 primers allowing for
Table 1. Sequence of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers used for construction of the Illumina library.

a unique combination of bar codes for each sample. The PCR
reaction contained 50 ng of extracted DNA. PCR reactions
were held at 94 °C for 3 min followed by 10 amplification cycles
using a touchdown protocol with denaturation at 94 °C for 45 s,
annealing at 61 °C for 45 s with 1 °C drop in each cycle, and an
extension at 72°C for 45 s. Amplification was continued
afterward with additional 15 cycles using 51 °C as annealing
temperature. Then, PCR was terminated with a final elongation
at 72 °C for 2 min. In the 2nd PCR, 15 µl of the 1st PCR products
were utilized with set 2 primers using the same concentrations
of PCR reagents. Reaction started with one step at 94 °C for 3
min, with amplification proceeding for 15 cycles at 94 °C for 45
s, 65 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 45 s with a final extension step
at 72 °C for 2 min. The DNA concentration of cleaned PCR
amplicons from the second PCR reaction was quantified, and
an equimolar combination of each reaction tube was prepared.
Finally, the library was sequenced at The Centre for Applied
Genomics at the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto, Canada
using one lane of a HiSeq 2000 to generate paired-end reads
of 2x 100 bases. The Illumina reads were deposited in the
Sequence Reads Archive at National Center for Biotechnology
Information (NCBI) under accession number SRP028823.
16S rRNA Sequence Analysis and Characterization of
Microbiota Composition and Diversity
Analysis of the sequencing reads was conducted as follows.
First, paired-end reads were merged into extended reads using
the Fast Length Adjustment of SHort reads algorithm (FLASH)
and the fastq file as input [15]. More than 95% of the reads
were efficiently merged with a perfect overlap between 10 and
80 nucleotides. Reads that failed to overlap were discarded.
Second, reads were extracted and binned by their 5’ and 3’
barcodes using the NovoBarCode command
(www.novocraft.com). During this process, the barcode
sequences were stripped from the classified reads. Third, the
reads were quality filtered using the fastq_quality_filter
command from the Fastx toolkit (Version 0.0.13.1; http://
hannonlab.cshl.edu/) with a minimum quality score of 33.
Finally, the quality filtered classified reads were analyzed using
Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology (QIIME) software
version 1.5.0 [16]. Specifically, reads were clustered into
Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) by running a closed￾reference OTU picking process using UCLUST against the
Greengenes database (version 4feb2011) at 97% sequence
identity. The OTUs inherited the taxonomy associated with the
corresponding Greengenes sequences. After removal of
singletons and doubletons, the relative abundance of taxa
(from the phylum to the genus levels) was determined for each
sample using the QIIME package. OTUs or taxa exhibiting
significant differential representation between groups were
selected by linear discriminant analysis using the LEfSe
package [17].
Data Analysis
Data were analyzed using STATA 9.0 (StataCorp, College
Station, TX). Continuous data were analyzed using unpaired t
tests and categorical data were assessed using Fisher’s exact
test. Differences in microbiota relative abundance were
analyzed using two-tailed Mann-Whitney test.
Results
Comparison of Vancomycin and Metronidazole-Treated
CDI Patients
During the study period, 76 CDI patients had stool samples
available for analysis (range, 1 to 8 stool samples), including
42 (55%) patients treated with oral vancomycin and 34 (45%)
patients treated with oral metronidazole. Table 2 shows a
comparison of the characteristics of the metronidazole and
vancomycin-treated patients. There were no statistically
significant differences between the two groups. More than half
of C. difficile isolates from both treatment groups were NAP1/
ribotype 027 isolates based on PCR ribotyping and
amplification of the binary toxin gene cdtB.
Recovery of C. difficile From Stool of Vancomycin and
Metronidazole-Treated Patients
Figure 1 shows the frequency of recovery of C. difficile from
stool samples of vancomycin and metronidazole-treated
patients. Vancomycin-treated patients had detectable C.
difficile in stool less frequently than metronidazole-treated
patients at the end of CDI therapy but the difference was not
statistically significant (4 of 19, 21% versus 5 of 14, 36%; P
=0.44); however, vancomycin-treated patients were
significantly more likely than metronidazole-treated patients to
have detectable C. difficile at 10 to 15 days after completion of
therapy (6 of 11, 55% versus 2 of 16, 13%; P = 0.03). In
addition to acquisition of toxigenic strains, 2 vancomycin￾treated patients acquired colonization with nontoxigenic C.
difficile between 8 and 14 days after discontinuation of therapy,
whereas none of the metronidazole-treated patients acquired
nontoxigenic C. difficile.
Antibiotic Concentrations
Figure 2 shows the concentrations of vancomycin and
metronidazole present in stool during and after CDI treatment.
High concentrations of vancomycin were present during
therapy and detectable levels persisted in stool for up to 8 days
after therapy. Metronidazole was detectable in a majority of
mid-treatment stool samples (12 of 13 samples tested had
detectable metronidazole). However, none of the 26 samples
tested at the end of treatment or after treatment had detectable
metronidazole.
In vitro Assay of Colonization Resistance
Figure 3 shows results for the in vitro assay of colonization
resistance. For vancomycin-treated patients, growth of C.
difficile was suppressed in a majority of stool filtrates and
suspensions during therapy and for 3-5 days after completion
of therapy. By 6 days after discontinuation of CDI therapy, a
majority of stool filtrates supported growth of C. difficile,
consistent with the finding that inhibitory levels of vancomycin
were no longer present. From 6 to 21 days after therapy, a
majority of stool suspensions supported growth of C. difficile,

whereas after 21 days most samples were inhibitory,
suggesting that the components of the microbiota that provide
colonization resistance had recovered sufficiently to inhibit
growth.
For metronidazole-treated patients, growth of C. difficile was
suppressed in stool filtrates and suspensions of samples with
detectable metronidazole during treatment, but not in filtrates of
samples with no detectable metronidazole. By 15 to 20 days
after metronidazole therapy, a majority of stool suspensions
inhibited in vitro growth of inoculated C. difficile.
Microbiota signature of C. difficile colonization
resistance
Microbiota relative abundance at different phylogenetic levels
was studied in stool specimens that did or did not support
growth of C. difficile based upon the C. difficile in vitro
colonization assay; for this analysis, specimens collected
during or within 5 days after CDI treatment were excluded
because suppression of C. difficile may have been due to the
CDI therapy. At the phylum level, Actinobacteria levels were
higher (P=0.07) in specimens with intact colonization
resistance (i.e., inhibition of C. difficile growth) (Figure 4).
Bacterial biomarkers associated with intact or disrupted
colonization resistance to C. difficile were detected using
LEFSe approach [17]. Based on LEFSe analysis, three
bacterial genera were associated with absence of colonization
resistance to C. difficile (Figure 5). The two genera with the
highest effect size (Salmonella and Hahella) belong to
Gammaproteobacteria class of the phylum Proteobacteria,
while the third genus (Collinsella) is related to the phylum
Actinobacteria. In general, bacteria belonging to three phyla
(Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, and Tenericutes) were associated
with intact colonization resistance. The highest effect size was
observed in the class Actinobacteria and the genus
Lactobacillus. Other bacteria, arranged from highest to lowest
effect size are unclassified genus of the Catabacteriaceae
family, the order Actinomycetales, the genus Ruminococcus,
the genus Finegoldia, an unclassified genus of the
Coriobacteriaceae family, and an unidentified bacterium genus
(RFN2) of Tenericutes. Also, the relative abundance of the
genus Bifidobacterium was increased in resistant compared to
sensitive samples (P = 0.055).
Analysis of Stool Microbiota of Vancomycin-Treated
Patients
Figure 6 shows data for a single vancomycin-treated patient
that illustrates the typical changes seen over time in the stool
microbiota before, during, and after treatment. A total of ~ 14
million high quality reads were generated from all samples with
an average reads count of ~ 0.5 million reads/sample. Before
treatment, the microbiota was composed of 8 phyla, with
Proteobacteria (67.1%), Firmicutes (27.7%), and Actinobacteria
(2.2%) being most abundant. The remaining 3.1% was
distributed among Bacteroidetes, Cyanobacteria, Fusobacteria,
Tenericutes, and Verrucomicrobia (data not shown). During
vancomycin treatment, there was a general decrease in
different families of the Firmicutes phylum including
Streptococcaceae, Lachnospiraceae, Leuconostocaceae, and
Ruminococcaceae. In addition to Firmicutes phylum, a marked
decrease was also observed in the Proteobacteria,
Actinobacteria and Tenericutes phyla represented by
Enterobacteriaceae, Bifidobacteriaceae, and
Erysipelotrichaceae families; respectively. This decrease in
relative abundance reached its lowest level at the end of
treatment period.
Following treatment, two main trends were observed in
families with reduced abundance during treatment. First, there
was a sudden increase in bacterial relative abundance 15-20
days following treatment. Second, the bacteria relative
abundance dropped to a level lower than the pre-treatment

Ruminococcaceae, and Enterobacteriaceae. The second trend
was characterized by an increase in relative abundance
following treatment over a 30 day period, in which it exceeded
the original pre-treatment state. This was observed with
Bifidobacteriaceae, Leuconostocaceae, Lachnospiraceae, and
Erysipelotrichaceae.
Discussion
In an observational study of CDI patients, we found that
vancomycin-treated patients had high levels of vancomycin in
stool during therapy that typically decreased to undetectable
levels by 6 to 10 days after discontinuation of therapy. In
contrast, metronidazole-treated patients had low levels of drug
present during treatment that decreased to undetectable levels

for metronidazole) did not inhibit growth of inoculated C.
difficile, suggesting that the microbiota that provide colonization
resistance against C. difficile had not yet recovered. Moreover,
vancomycin-treated patients frequently developed recurrent
colonization with C. difficile 10 to 14 days after completion of
therapy, whereas metronidazole-treated patients did not. These
results suggest that there is a vulnerable period for re￾establishment of C. difficile colonization after oral vancomycin
or metronidazole therapy that extends from the time when drug
levels are reduced to subinhibitory concentrations to the time
when the microbiota are sufficiently recovered to inhibit growth
of C. difficile.
Previous studies have demonstrated that oral vancomycin
may cause marked and prolonged suppression of the
indigenous microbiota of the colon, including Bacteroides spp.
[4,5]. Our data confirm those observations. Moreover, our
findings demonstrate that oral metronidazole therapy may also
be associated with prolonged disruption of the microbiota.
Although previous studies have demonstrated that
disturbances of the microbiota may be prolonged, they have
Figure 3. In vitro assay of colonization resistance during and after oral vancomycin (A) or metronidazole (B)
treatment. Growth of Clostridium difficile was assessed in homogenized fresh stool specimens inoculated with 104 colony-forming
units (CFU) of vegetative C. difficile. Loss of colonization resistance was defined as >1 log10CFU increase in the C. difficile
concentration. To assess whether residual metronidazole or vancomycin in stool samples could account for suppression of growth
of inoculated C. difficile, growth of the C. difficile isolates was concurrently assessed in sterile filtrates of the stool suspensions.

not included a functional assessment of the ability of the
microbiota to inhibit colonization by C. difficile. Our findings
from the in vitro assay of colonization resistance suggest that
functional recovery of colonization resistance may precede full
recovery of the diversity of the microbiota. Our in vitro data are
supported by the finding that C. difficile was frequently acquired
at 10 to 14 days but not later after discontinuation of
vancomycin therapy. Similarly, Johnson et al. [18] found that
vancomycin, but not metronidazole, treatment suppressed C.
difficile in stool of asymptomatic carriers, but that 8 of 9 carriers
again began shedding spores 20 +8 days after completing
treatment.
Based upon deep 16SrRNA sequencing analysis, the
presence of bacteria belonging to three phyla (Actinobacteria,
Firmicutes, and Tenericutes) was associated with intact
colonization resistance. The class Actinobacteria and the
genus Lactobacillus had the strongest association with intact
colonization resistance to C. difficile. Actinobacteria is a very
large class that encompasses about 300 different bacterial
genera, including Bifidobacteriaceae. We found that the family
Bifidobacteriaceae regained colonization in the gut following
vancomycin treatment at a level higher than the pretreatment
state. Of particular interest, the relative abundance of the
genus Bifidobacterium was increased in samples with intact

collected before or after completion of vancomycin therapy for Clostridium difficile infection (CDI), stratified by those with intact (i.e.,
C. difficile growth suppressed) or disrupted (i.e., C. difficile growth supported) colonization resistance based on the in vitro

phyla distribution of one sample. Columns are labelled with sample ID and timing of stool collection in comparison to vancomycin

colonization resistance. Although the efficacy of probiotics for
prevention of CDI is controversial, some studies suggest that
Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, when used as probiotics,
may be associated with reduced CDI [19,20].
Ruminococcus spp. was also associated with intact
colonization resistance in this study. Ruminococcus strains are
known to produce the lantibiotic Ruminococcin A (RumA) in the
presence of trypsin, which inhibit the in vitro growth of various
pathogenic bacteria including C. difficile and C. perfringens
[21]. LEFSe has highlighted the family of Catabacteriaceae
within the group of colonization resistant bacteria.
Catabacteriaceae is a recently identified family which
comprises one descendant, Catabacter hongkongensis [22,23].
The role of C. hongkongensis in the human gut and its

microbial community is unknown. Similarly, the role of
Finegoldia and Coriobacteriaceae in C. difficile colonization
resistance requires further investigation. Finally, although the
unidentified bacterium genus (RFN2) of Tenericutes was
identified among the bacteria associated with colonization
resistance, their increased abundance following vancomycin
treatment may also be attributed to their natural resistance to
vancomycin [24,25]. Salmonella, Hahella and Collinsella were
associated with disrupted colonization resistance.
Our findings have important implications for development of
strategies to prevent recurrences of CDI. For example,
nontoxigenic C. difficile strains are in Phase 2 trials for
secondary prevention of CDI [6,26]. Knowledge of the
vulnerable period for re-establishment of C. difficile colonization
may be useful for optimization of the timing of dosing of this
agent. In addition, this knowledge could be used to optimize
the timing of other biotherapeutic agents being trialed for
prevention of recurrences. Other infection control measures
(e.g., environmental disinfection or bathing to reduce the
burden of spores on skin) may also be most beneficial if
targeted to the vulnerable period.
Our study has several limitations. The study population
included mostly elderly men with multiple medical problems.
Additional assessments of the impact of CDI therapies in other
populations are needed. Because the study was observational,
it is possible that the longer period of disruption of colonization
resistance in the vancomycin versus metronidazole-treated
patients was attributable to the fact that vancomycin-treated
subjects were more likely to have severe CDI, rather than to
differences in the 2 drugs. However, the longer period of
disruption of colonization resistance by vancomycin is
consistent with the higher and more prolonged levels of drug
achieved in the intestinal tract. The in vitro assay of
colonization resistance has been validated with in vivo findings
in hamsters [13] and mice (authors’ unpublished data), but
further validation of this method is required in humans.
In summary, we demonstrated that that there is a vulnerable
period for re-establishment of C. difficile colonization after CDI

treatment that begins when levels of vancomycin or
metronidazole reach subinhibitory concentrations and extends
for about 3 weeks in most patients. These findings have
important implications for development of effective
interventions to prevent recurrences of CDI.
