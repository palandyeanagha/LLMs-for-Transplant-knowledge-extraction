The Clinical Picture
Ulcerative leg nodules in a transplant recipient
A 66-year-old white man presents with a 1-month 
history of two nontender, nonpruritic skin le￾sions on his leg 3 weeks after undergoing bilateral 
lung transplantation for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis 
(Figure 1). Except for transient lymphopenia, the post￾operative course has been uneventful, with no epi￾sodes of rejection. Immunosuppressive drugs include 
tacrolimus (Prograf) and steroids. He has a history of 
insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, and no history 
of significant trauma to his legs. Other than the skin 
lesions, he feels well and has no systemic symptoms. 
He has no history of iron overload or deferoxamine 
(Desferal) therapy.
Q: What is the probable diagnosis?
□ Kaposi sarcoma
□ Majocchi (trichophytic) granuloma
□ Staphylococcus aureus furunculosis
□ Primary cutaneous mucormycosis
□ Disseminated zoster

with numerous nonseptated, branching fungal hy￾phae (Figure 2). A fungal culture grew Absidia spe￾cies. No evidence of disseminated disease was found 
on computed tomography of the brain, paranasal si￾nuses, chest, abdomen, and pelvis. Histologic studies 
and cultures taken from both native and transplanted 
lungs were negative for fungi.
■ Causes and risk factors
Mucormycosis is an invasive infection caused by fungi 
of a variety of genera (Rhizopus, Rhizomucor, Mucor, 
Absidia, Apophysomyces, Cunninghamella, Saksenaea, 
Conidiobolus, and Basidiobolus species) belonging to the 
class Zygomycetes in the order Mucorales. These ubiq￾uitous environmental fungi have been found widely 
distributed in hospital sources, having been cultured 
from plaster casts,1
 tongue depressors,2
 cloth tapes 
for securing endotracheal tubes,3
 peritoneal dialysis

These fungi rarely cause disease in healthy people, 
but patients with certain risk factors may develop dis￾seminated disease, in which the death rate is high.6
 Risk 
factors include diabetes mellitus, renal failure, trauma, 
burns, malnutrition, solid organ transplantation, he￾matologic malignancies, use of immunosuppressive 
drugs (eg, chemotherapeutic agents, corticosteroids, cy￾closporine, methotrexate, infliximab [Remicade]7
), and 
iron overload and iron-chelating therapy with deferox￾amine.8
 Patients such as ours—an organ transplant re￾cipient with concomitant diabetes mellitus—are highly 
susceptible to this infection.
■ diagnosis
The clinical presentation of mucormycosis can be 
rhino-orbitocerebral (most common),9
 pulmonary, 
primary cutaneous, gastrointestinal, cardiac, or dis￾seminated infection.6
 Primary cutaneous mucormyco￾sis occurs from fungal inoculation of the dermis. Small 
areas of trauma may be all that is needed for this in￾oculation to occur.
The initial lesion may be an erythematous patch, 
plaque, or nodule that may subsequently ulcerate and 
become gangrenous or necrotic.10
The differential diagnosis of new cutaneous nod￾ules in an immunocompromised patient includes a 
wide variety of infections, such as ecthyma gangreno￾sum caused by Pseudomonas or Candida species, herpes 
simplex virus infection, cryptococcal infection, phaeo￾hyphomycosis, and cutaneous aspergillosis.
Because the morphology of cutaneous mucormy￾cosis is not distinctive, and because we need to cast 
our net wide for the numerous, potentially lethal di￾agnostic possibilities in an immunosuppressed patient, 
it is crucial that we have a low threshold for prompt 
biopsy to establish the diagnosis and initiate definitive 
treatment. While skin biopsy for microscopy can sug￾gest certain fungi, the exact diagnosis is confirmed by 
a fungal culture of a biopsy specimen.
■ Treatment
Localized soft tissue infection is more amenable to 
therapy and therefore carries a better prognosis than 
visceral or disseminated disease.
The best treatment outcomes of primary cutaneous 
mucormycosis are achieved with both complete exci￾sion and debridement of necrotic tissue and systemic 
antifungal therapy. Amphotericin B in conventional 
form (Fungizone) and liposomal form (AmBisome) 
and posaconazole (Noxafil)11–12 are effective.
Paradoxically, in contrast to deferoxamine, other 
iron chelators such as deferiprone (Ferriprox, not 
available in the United States) and deferasirox (Ex￾jade), which do not supply iron to the fungus, had 
been shown to be effective against Zygomycetes in in 
vitro and animal models. The role of iron chelators 
as adjunctive therapy for mucormycosis needs further 
investigation.8
Primary cutaneous mucormycosis may become a 
disseminated infection. Therefore, one should have a 
high index of suspicion. When a transplant recipient 
develops a cutaneous plaque or nodule, biopsy should 
be performed promptly. Failure to do so can increase the 
risk of morbidity and death. ■
