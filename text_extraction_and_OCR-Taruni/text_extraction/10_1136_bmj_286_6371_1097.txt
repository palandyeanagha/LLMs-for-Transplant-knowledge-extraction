Abstract
Corticosteroids have the major role in the immuno￾suppressive treatment of patients who have received
renal transplants. Despite their extensive use there is
still debate about the appropriate dose that will prevent
rejection of the renal allograft with the least morbidity.
From March 1979 to November 1981 a randomised
controlled trial of high (33 patients) v low oral dose (34
patients) of prednisolone along with azathioprine was
conducted in recipients of first cadaveric transplants who
had received a blood transfusion within six months of
transplantation. The main difference in outcome between
the two groups was a high incidence of some infections in
the high dose group. Patient mortality, graft survival,
transplant function, and number of rejection episodes
were indistinguishable in the two groups, but rejection
episodes tended to occur later in the high dose group.
These findings suggest that the use of lower doses of
corticosteroids soon after cadaveric renal transplanta￾tion does not jeopardise graft survival and results in
lower patient morbidity.

Introduction
Since 1963, when Goodwin et al reported the use of corti￾costeroids in the immunosuppressive treatment after human
renal transplantation,' corticosteroids and azathioprine have been
the main chemical immunosuppressive agents used in recipients
of renal transplants. Despite extensive use of corticosteroids, the
optimal dose for the prevention of graft rejection with the least
side effects has not been established. High doses of steroids are
still used in several units in the early months after transplanta￾tion before maintenance doses of 10-20 mg/24 h are established.
On the other hand, the use of low dose steroids from the
outset has been supported strongly by the excellent results of
McGeown et all -who used 20 mg of prednisolone from the day
after transplantation. This is reinforced by the findings of Kreis
et al, who avoided the use of steroids altogether immediately
after transplantation, and believed that in the absence of obvious
rejection some patients may not need corticosteroids at all.5
Recently Buckels et a16 and Morris et al,' in prospective trials in
recipients of cadaveric kidneys, compared the use of high dose
and low dose steroids and reported that the use of low doses of
prednisolone from the day after transplantation does not jeopard￾ise graft survival and results in lower morbidity.
We conducted a prospective trial of high versus low dose
corticosteroids in patients receiving first cadaveric transplants.
Our purpose was to see if there were differences between the two
regimens in their ability to prevent rejection, and in the mortality
and morbidity which they induced in patients who had received
renal transplants.
Patients and methods
PATIENTS
From March 1979 to November 1981 all patients who were to receive
first cadaveric allografted kidneys were entered into the trial: no
patients were excluded. Thus a total of 67 patients, all aged over 15
years, were studied. All had received a standard transfusion (5 units
of blood from a donor that was more than 10 days old and had been
chosen at random) within six months of transplantation.
Patients were allocated at random to receive high or low doses of
corticosteroids. A series of sealed envelopes, in random order but

stratified beforehand to ensure that each group of 10 consecutive
envelopes contained five allocations to each group, was used for
randomisation. The envelopes were taken consecutively for each new
patient.
Seven patients had to be withdrawn from the trial for various
reasons (see table I); their data were used up to the date of with￾drawal.

TRIAL DESIGN
The question asked was whether a reduction in the early high dosage
of prednisolone during the first three months would lead to an
increased loss of grafts; the possibility that reduction might lead to
better results was recognised, but our principal anxiety was to
establish if there was any deterioration in results. We calculated that a
study of 70 patients would allow us a 1 in 20 chance of determining
whether the results had deteriorated by 200/, this being judged as an
unacceptable level of deterioration. In this calculation it was assumed
that survival rate of first cadaveric grafts in the group receiving the
high dose would be 600, after two years.
The high dose regimen was that in standard use in the transplant
unit for a decade; the low dose regimen was the regimen, admittedly
arbitrary, which was the lowest acceptable to all the clinicians in the
unit. Since the steroid dosage was given according to bodyweight (see
below) we planned that the heavier patients would receive rather more
during the first three months than the dose described by McGeown
and colleagues,' while the lighter patients would receive less. We did
not, however, use the prolonged high dose regimen for acute rejection
episodes as described from Belfast.2
Figure 1 shows the schedule of steroids that was given to the
patients: 33 patients received the high dose and 34 the low dose. The
daily dose of corticosteroids was given in two divided doses, the
evening dose gradually being phased out as dosage was reduced. All
patients also received azathioprine, 2-5 mg/kg/day, which was omitted
temporarily in the presence of leucopenia ( < 5000 white blood cells/,ul).
Acute rejection episodes were treated in both groups with 1 g methyl￾prednisolone given intravenously on three consecutive days.

ANALYSIS OF OUTCOME
The two groups were compared for factors that could influence
graft survival-sex, age primary renal disease, HLA-A and HLA-B
mismatches, blood group, and parity. All patients had received at least
5 units of 10 day old blood before transplantation. Patient mortality,
graft survival, renal function as estimated by the plasma creatinine
concentration (tmol/l), the number of rejection episodes, and the day
of onset of the first rejection episodes were compared in the two groups.
ANALYSIS OF COMPLICATIONS
The incidence of infections, which were divided into urinary tract
infections, chest infections, and "others" was analysed. Other
infections included wound infection; bacterial infections in sites apart
from the urinary tract, the lung, and the wound; positive blood
cultures; cytomegalovirus infections; herpes virus infections; and
pyrexia of undetermined origin. We also recorded the incidence of
other complications that might be attributed to corticosteroids, such
as avascular necrosis of bone, alimentary tract complications, steroid
induced diabetes, and cataracts. Finally, the rate of healing of the
transplant wound and the duration of hospital admission during and
after transplantation were compared.
STATISTICAL METHODS
The life table method8 was used to analyse the survival of grafts
and of patients, the time to first rejection, and the time to discharge
from hospital. The Cox-Mantel logrank test was used to test the differ￾ences. The x2 method was used to assess possible differences in the
composition of the two groups, the infection rates and possible steroid
related complications. Student's t test was used to test the differences
in ages of the two groups, the total number of rejection episodes, and
the number of episodes in the first month, and the plasma creatinine
concentrations in surviving grafts.
Results
There was no difference between the groups (p < 0-05) in all factors
believed to influence graft survival (table II).

DEATHS
One patient out of the 33 who had received a high dose died from
faecal peritonitis after a perforated ischaemic colon; his graft had been
placed successfully on a Dacron iliac bypass graft, but intestinal
circulation became insufficient. Three patients out of the 34 who had
received a low dose died: one from a myocardial infarct in a hypo￾tensive episode, itself following a bleed from the renal anastomosis
during anticoagulation for a postoperative deep venous thrombosis;
another from rupture of a known aneurysm while waiting for replace￾ment 15 months after transplant; and a third from a cerebrovascular
accident. The last two of these three patients had functioning grafts.

FIG 2-Life table analysis of survival of patient and graft in those
receiving high ( ) and low dose (---- ). Data from patients
who were withdrawn from the trial (see text) were used up to
point of withdrawal, and deaths of patients with functioning graft
were noted as cessation of follow up in calculating graft survival.
GRAFT SURVIVAL AND FUNCTION
Thirteen grafts of the 33 were lost in the high dose group and 10 of
the 34 in the low dose group. Survival rates calculated actuarially at
two years were 55% for the high dose group and f68% for the low dose
group (fig 2). There was no difference between these two sets of data
on logrank testing (p=0 12), and a less than 0-05 chance that these
data are compatible with a true reduction in graft survival of 20%
(X2=3-88), the initial target of the trial. There is, however, a 1 in 5
chance that a smaller reduction in graft survival might occur at the
10% level, and this possibility is not excluded by our data because of
the small numbers entered.
In the life table analysis the grafts of the patients who died with
functioning grafts, as well as those of the patients who were withdrawn
from the trial, were considered as functioning grafts with duration of
function equal to the time that they were followed up in the trial.
There was no difference between the groups in the renal function of
the patients with functioning grafts, as shown by plasma creatinine
concentrations (fig 3).

during the first three months after transplantation. There was,
however, a significant difference in the time to first rejection episodes
(p < 0 05) and in number of rejection episodes during the first month
after transplantation, during which period more rejection episodes
were diagnosed in the low dose group (p 0-05) (table III).

COMPLICATIONS
Infections were the most frequent complication in both groups,
although no patient died of it. There was no significant difference in
the number of patients who presented with urinary tract infections or
chest infections, although their incidence was greater in the patients
receiving high dose. A significant difference was found in the number
of patients in the high dose group with "other" infections (table VI);
table V shows the actual numbers and types of these infections, with a
higher incidence of almost all types of infection in the high dose group.
The incidence of other complications that might be attributed to
corticosteroids was not significantly different in the two groups,
although their incidence was greater in the higher dose group (table
VI).
Wound healing and admission to hospital-By 15 days after operation,
21 wounds had healed in the high dose group and 30 in the low dose
group (p < 0-05). No significant difference was found in the time that
the patients in the two groups spent in hospital during and after the
transplantation (fig 4) by the logrank analysis (p->0 10) although the
six patients with the longest stay were all receiving the high dosage
regimen.

Discussion
Renal transplantation has become the treatment of choice in
end stage renal failure as it has led to excellent rehabilitation of
patients9 and is cheaper than dialysis.10 The problems of
morbidity and graft failure, however, have by no means been
resolved. A "safe" immunosuppressive regimen would probably
be the key to their solution. This, for the present, means the
optimal use of azathioprine and corticosteroids, although the
impact of cyclosporin'1 may yet be considerable. Debate
concerning the optimum dose of corticosteroids continues, and
many units follow the policy that "more is best," although
several reports-including our own-support the idea that lower
doses are equally effective.2-4 6 7
Our trial was conducted at about the same time as the trials in
Birmingham6 and Oxford, 7 but in some ways is superior in
design. Our corticosteroid dose was based on bodyweight, all
the patients were receiving first cadaveric transplants, and all
had received transfusions before transplantation. In the
Birmingham trial the doses of corticosteroids were fixed, so that
the corticosteroid activity could be influenced by the patient's
bodyweight. Not all their patients had had transfusions, and
some had received more than one allograft. In the Oxford trial
the doses of corticosteroids were also fixed, and the patients in the
low dose group routinely received 1 g of intravenous methyl￾prednisolone on the sixth, seventh, and eighth day after trans￾plantation, and the gap between the two regimens may have
been decreased by this. Some of their patients had received more
than one allograft, and only 6001" of them had had transfusions
before transplantation. Our rate of survival for patients and
grafts is, however, similar to those of the other two groups, and
not different to those of other units.2 This must be seen in
relation to the fact that our patients were older-about half were
over 45 and a quarter over 60-and that all patients received the
same corticosteroid dosage from 12 weeks onwards.
The analysis of graft survival and the study of renal function
showed that the low doses of corticosteroids used appear to cover
the patients from the danger of loss of function in their grafts to
the same extent as higher initial doses. In fact, the results were
better in the low dose group, though not statistically significant.
Because of small numbers, our data cannot exclude the possi￾bility of a smaller reduction in graft survival at the 10"' level,"'
although we have excluded the possibility of a 20%' reduction.
Four deaths were asymmetrically distributed, three being in the
low and one in the high dose group, but again this does not reach
significance; examination of the circumstances of death suggests
that at least two were coincidental and unrelated to treatment.
The zero mortality in patients under the age of 45 was gratifying.
The number of acute rejection episodes was indistinguishable
between the two groups, but the time to first rejection was
longer and the number of rejection episodes in the first month
lower in the high dose group. This postponement of early
rejection did not seem to affect long term survival of the grafts.
Both bacterial and viral infections outside the respiratory and
urinary tracts were more common in the high dose group. It is
accepted that there is a direct relation between the incidence of
infection and the quantity of immunosuppressive treatment in
patients who have received renal transplants.'0 1 Because the
rest of the immunosuppressive treatment was the same in the
two groups, the greater incidence of almost all the infections in
the patients in the high dose group must be attributed to the
higher dose of corticosteroids that was given to them.
The morbidity from the other complications that may be
attributed to corticosteroids was not different in the two groups,
although it is noteworthy that again more patients in the high
dose group were affected by them. Analysis of the number of
transplant incisions healed within 15 days of transplantation
showed that wounds of the patients in the high dose group needed
longer to heal. This may be partially due to the increased inci￾dence of wound infections in the high dose group, because most
wound infections were infections of the transplant incision. We
cannot, however, exclude a direct influence of corticosteroids in
this prolongation of the time to healing, a fact which contributes
to the patients' morbidity.
Our results clearly show that low doses of corticosteroids, with
azathioprine, were not only sufficient as immunosuppressive
treatment but they also led to less morbidity in the patients.
Since this trial has finished, we have continued the low dose
regimen in all our patients receiving renal transplants. To deter￾mine whether even lower doses of corticosteroids could be used
with even greater safety and comparable (or better) results will
require a further trial.
