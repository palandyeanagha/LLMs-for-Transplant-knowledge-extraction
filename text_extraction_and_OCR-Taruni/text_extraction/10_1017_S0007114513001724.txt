Abstract
The effects of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) eating plan on childhood metabolic syndrome (MetS) and insulin
resistance remain to be determined. The present study aimed to assess the effects of recommendations to follow the DASH diet v.
usual dietary advice (UDA) on the MetS and its features in adolescents. In this randomised cross-over clinical trial, sixty post-pubescent
adolescent girls with the MetS were randomly assigned to receive either the recommendations to follow the DASH diet or UDA for
6 weeks. After a 4-week washout period, the participants were crossed over to the alternate arm. The DASH group was recommended
to consume a diet rich in fruits, vegetables and low-fat dairy products and low in saturated fats, total fats and cholesterol. UDA consisted
of general oral advice and written information about healthy food choices based on healthy MyPlate. Compliance was assessed through the
quantification of plasma vitamin C levels. In both the groups, fasting venous blood samples were obtained at baseline and at the end of
each phase of the intervention. The mean age and weight of the participants were 14·2 (SD 1·7) years and 69 (SD 14·5) kg, respectively.
Their mean BMI and waist circumference were 27·3 kg/m2 and 85·6 cm, respectively. Serum vitamin C levels tended to be higher in the
DASH phase than in the UDA phase (860 (SE 104) v. 663 (SE 76) ng/l, respectively, P¼0·06). Changes in weight, waist circumference
and BMI were not significantly different between the two intervention phases. Although changes in systolic blood pressure were not stat￾istically significant between the two groups (P¼0·13), recommendations to follow the DASH diet prevented the increase in diastolic blood
pressure compared with UDA (P¼0·01). We found a significant within-group decrease in serum insulin levels (101·4 (SE 6·2) v. 90·0 (SE
5·5) pmol/l, respectively, P¼0·04) and a non-significant reduction in the homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance score
(P¼0·12) in the DASH group. Compared with the UDA group, the DASH group experienced a significant reduction in the prevalence
of the MetS and high blood pressure. Recommendations to follow the DASH eating pattern for 6 weeks among adolescent girls with
the MetS led to reduced prevalence of high blood pressure and the MetS and improved diet quality compared with UDA. This type of
healthy diet can be considered as a treatment modality for the MetS and its components in children.
Key words: DASH diet: Metabolic syndrome: Children: Obesity
The metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a clustering of cardiovascular
risk factors including abdominal obesity, hypertension, abnor￾mal glucose homeostasis and dyslipidaemia(1). This syndrome
increases the risk of atherosclerosis, type 2 diabetes and stroke
and enhances the mortality rate by 20–80 %(2–5). It seems that
insulin resistance is the primary defect in the MetS(6). Findings
from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey have revealed that the MetS is prevalent among 24 % of
men and 23 % of women in the USA(7). In Iran, the MetS is
highly prevalent in adults, with an estimated prevalence of

more than 30 %(8,9). In children, there is no general consensus
on the cut-off values and components of the MetS(3,10). Based
on the modified Adult Treatment Panel III definition, 10 % of
Iranian adolescents are affected by the syndrome(11). Since
the process of atherosclerosis, which is linked to obesity and
other components of the MetS, starts at an early age, the pri￾mary prevention and treatment of childhood MetS are of
great importance(6).
Lifestyle interventions, including diet therapy, have long been
recommended for the management of the MetS(12). In order to
prescribe a therapeutic diet, all abnormalities of the MetS
should be taken into account(4). Most individuals with the
MetS are overweight or obese, and weight loss is the key
recommendation to improve all aspects of the MetS(13).
Among children, energy restriction and weight loss can hinder
growth and development(2). Therefore, the appropriate diet
for the management of childhood MetS is the one that meets
the growth requirements of children besides modifying their
metabolic abnormalities(2). The Dietary Approaches to Stop
Hypertension (DASH) eating plan might be beneficial for
patients with the MetS(14). The DASH diet is rich in vegetables,
fruits, whole grains, low-fat dairy products, Mg, K, Ca and
fibre(15). The DASH diet also has a low Na content (2400 mg/
d)(16). Adherence to the DASH diet has been reported to lower
blood pressure(15) and lipid profiles(17). The beneficial effect
of the DASH diet on glycaemic control and liver enzymes in
type 2 diabetic patients has also been documented(18). Limited
data indicating the effects of the DASH diet on the MetS are avail￾able. We are aware of just one study that has assessed the effects
of the DASH diet on the MetS among adults(14). To our knowl￾edge, the effects of the DASH diet on the features of the MetS
in children have not been examined yet. Furthermore, the
DASH diet has been applicable and acceptable among the
adult population(19), but its acceptability in children remains
unknown. The DASH diet contains high amounts of low-fat
dairy products, Ca, K and Mg, all of which have been shown
to affect the features of the MetS(20,21). Moreover, the restricted
Na content of the DASH diet leads to lower blood pressure
levels(15). In addition, greater amounts of dietary fibre, folate,
vitamin C, carotenoids, phytosterols, phytochemicals and anti￾oxidants in the DASH diet(22) make it suitable for treating the
MetS and maintaining normal growth in children and adoles￾cents. Therefore, the present study was conducted to assess
the effects of recommendations to follow the DASH diet v.
usual dietary advice (UDA) on the MetS and its features in ado￾lescents. We hypothesised that recommendations to follow the
DASH diet would be an appropriate approach for the treatment
of children with the MetS. Since dietary adherence of females is
higher than that of males(23), we conducted the present study
among adolescent girls.
Subjects and methods
Participants
A total of sixty female post-pubescent adolescent girls aged
11–18 years with the MetS participated in the present
study. The MetS was defined as having three or more of the
following criteria, according to the Adult Treatment Panel III
criteria modified for children and adolescents(24): (1) abdomi￾nal adiposity (waist circumference .75th percentile for age);
(2) low levels of serum HDL-cholesterol (,500 mg/l); (3)
hypertriacylglycerolaemia (TAG levels $1000 mg/l); (4) elev￾ated blood pressure (systolic blood pressure (SBP) or diastolic
blood pressure (DBP) .90th percentile for age and height
from the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute’s rec￾ommended cut-off points); (5) impaired glucose homeostasis
(fasting plasma glucose levels $1000 mg/l). Subjects were
not included in the study if they had CVD or kidney or liver
diseases or were taking any medications affecting nutrient
metabolism, blood lipids and blood pressure or any vitamin
and mineral supplements. The required sample size for the
present study was determined using serum TAG levels(24) as
a key dependent variable. We used the standard formula
suggested for two-period, two-treatment cross-over studies.
Given the 80 % power and type I error of 5 %, we required a
sample size of thirty-two participants to detect significant
differences between the two groups. Considering the high
dropouts in cross-over trials, we recruited sixty female adoles￾cents based on the inclusion criteria. Parental written consent
and adolescent assent were obtained. During the study, eleven
subjects were dropped out. The reasons for dropping out
were as follows: fear of blood sampling (n 6); educationally
busy (n 2); surgery (n 1); personal reasons (n 1); mother’s
demise (n 1). Finally, forty-nine adolescent girls completed
the whole trial. The present study was conducted according
to the guidelines laid down in the Declaration of Helsinki.
The study was ethically approved by the Food Security
Research Center of Isfahan University of Medical Sciences
and has been registered at the Iranian registry of clinical
trials (http://www.irct.ir; identifier: IRCT201110191485N6).
Study design
In this cross-over randomised clinical trial, after obtaining
detailed information about their lifestyle characteristics in a
run-in period of 2 weeks, the participants were randomly allo￾cated to follow the DASH diet or UDA for 6 weeks. Random
assignment was done by the use of computer-generated
random numbers. A 4-week washout period separated the two
phases of the study. During this period, the participants were
requested to go back to their old eating habits. After the washout
period, the participants were crossed over to the alternate arm:
those consuming the DASH diet in the first phase were asked to
follow UDA and vice versa. Except for the participants and
the study dietitian who provided dietary advice, all study per￾sonnel (including those working in the laboratories) and other
researchers wereblindedtothedietaryassignment.Eachpartici￾pant completed a 3 d dietary record (two week days and one
weekend day) during the run-in period as well as throughout
each phase of the intervention. Food intake was recorded by
the participant at the time the foods were consumed to minimise
reliance on memory. To assess compliance to the DASH diet, the
average of the 3 d dietary records obtained from the participants
in the DASH phase was used. Food diaries were analysed for
their nutrient content using the Nutritionist-IV software

(First Databank), which was modified for Iranian foods. Compli￾ance to the DASH diet was also assessed using serum vitamin C
levels as well as dietary records. The participants were asked to
not change their habitual physical activity levels throughout
the study. They were asked to record their physical activities
for 2 d in the run-in period and throughout each phase of the
intervention.
The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension diet
The DASH diet used in this intervention was slightly modified
from the original version of the DASH diet for adults to more clo￾sely conform to the unique nutritional needs of adolescents.
Energy requirements of each participant were calculated indivi￾dually based on equations suggested by the American Dietetic
Association, Pediatric Weight Management Guidelines for
weight maintenance(25). We did not prescribe weight loss diets
for adolescents. All diets were designed to maintain the current
weight. Diets were prescribed according to the energy require￾ments of the adolescents. The macronutrient composition of the
DASH diet was as follows: carbohydrates, 53–58 %; proteins,
15–18 %; total fats, 26–30 % of total energy. The dietary goals
of the DASH group as well as a sample of the 1 d menu of the
DASH diet are summarised in Table 1. The DASH diet was
planed to contain high amounts of whole grains, fruits, veg￾etables and low-fat dairy products as well as low amounts of
saturated fats, cholesterol, refined grains, sweets and red meat.
Ca, K and Mg contents of the DASH diet were higher than those
recommended during UDA. The DASH diet contained
,2400 mg Na/d. Both groups receiving the DASH recommen￾dationsandUDAwerevisitedmonthly;eachsessionforapatient
took about 30–45 min. In the sessions, the study nutritionist
explained the benefits of the diet to the participants. The partici￾pants also received the required information to use the
exchange list of foods. They were taught as to how to record
their dietary intakes. A 7 d menu cycle based on the energy
requirements of each participant was planned. Moreover, the
participants were in touch with the nutritionist by phone every
day. The dietitian made calls to the participants to remind
them to record their food intakes and physical activities and to
ask them to follow the prescribed diet. The dietitian also asked
the participants if there was any problem with the diet. She
also responded to the questions that the participants had
about the diet. The participants were also free to make calls to
the dietitian whenever they had questions regarding their diet.
Usual dietary advice
The UDA group was given general oral and written infor￾mation about healthy food choices based on healthy
MyPlate(26). The eating patterns of the group were similar to
that of a typical Iranian diet (carbohydrates, 50–60 %; pro￾teins, 15–20 %; total fats, ,30 %; dietary fibre, 14 g/d; SFA,
24 g/d(27)). Ca, dairy product, nut and legume contents of
this diet were lower than those of the DASH diet. No dietary
menus were provided for this group.

Measurements
Body weight was measured while the participants were mini￾mally clothed and without shoes, using digital scales, and it
was recorded to the nearest 0·1 kg. Height was measured in a
standing position and without shoes, using a tape meter while
the shoulders were in a normal position. BMI was calculated
as weight (in kg) divided by height (in m2
). Waist circumference
was measured to the nearest 0·1 cm at the narrowest level over
light clothing, using an unstretched tape meter, without any
pressure to the body surface. Data on physical activities were
collected through physical activity records. The participants
were taught at the run-in period (before the start of the interven￾tion) as to how to record these data. They were requested to
record the type of physical activity and its intensity as well as
the duration ofthat activity.The sum ofthe durations ofactivities
in the physical activity records had to be 24 h. In case of any pro￾blem in recording, the dietitian contacted the participants to
further review the type, intensity and duration of the activities
recorded in the records. Data from the physical activity records
are expressed as metabolic equivalents. Blood pressure was
measured twice after the participants sat for 15 min using a stan￾dard digital sphygmomanometer (OMRON, M2; HEM.7117-E)
with an appropriate cuff size. Overall, two blood pressure
measurements were made at a 5 min interval, and the mean of
the two measurements was used for the analysis. To
avoid subjective errors, all measurements were made by the
same nutritionist.
Fasting blood samples for the measurement of glucose and
lipid concentrations were drawn after an overnight fast of 12 h.
Fasting blood glucose concentration was measured on the day
of blood collection using the enzymatic colorimetric method
with glucose oxidase. Serum concentrations of total choles￾terol and TAG were measured using commercially available
enzymatic reagents (Pars Azmoon). Serum HDL-cholesterol
levels were measured after precipitation of the apoB-contain￾ing lipoproteins with phosphotungstic acid. LDL-cholesterol
levels were calculated according to the Friedewald equation.
Inter-assay and intra-assay CV were 0·9 and 1·1 % for total
cholesterol and 1·6 and 1·2 % for TAG, respectively. Serum
insulin concentrations were measured using ELISA kits and
an ELISA reader (Diagnostic Biochem Canada Inc.). Insulin
resistance was estimated on the basis of fasting glucose and
insulin concentrations using the homeostasis model assess￾ment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) method. Plasma vita￾min C levels were measured using commercially available
kits (Glory Science Company) by the ELISA method.
Statistical analysis
To ensure the normal distribution of variables, we used the
Kolmogorov–Smirnov test. Log transformation was applied
for non-normally distributed variables. The analyses were
carried out based on the intention-to-treat approach. Missing
values were treated based on the last-observation-carried￾forward method. Descriptive statistics (means, SEM or SD and
range) for general characteristics of the study participants
are reported. Data on dietary intakes and physical activities
were compared by a paired t test. For each dependent vari￾able, we computed the changes from baseline by subtracting
the baseline value from the end-of-trial value. Within-group
and between-group changes in anthropometric measures as
well as biochemical indicators were compared using a
paired-samples t test. Differences in the prevalence of the
MetS and its components were examined using the x2 test.
We also assessed whether the carry-over effect was significant.
To assess the carry-over effect, we computed the average of
end-of-trial values for each variable for two treatments separ￾ately and compared the means of the two treatment orders
using a t test. P values ,0·05 were considered as significant.
Results
General characteristics of the study population are given in
Table 2. The mean age and weight of the participants were
14·2 years and 69 kg, respectively. Their mean BMI and
waist circumference were 27·3 kg/m2 and 85·6 cm, respect￾ively. At baseline, mean SBP and DBP of the participants
were 120·6 and 73·3 mmHg.
The average energy intake of the participants during the
run-in period, based on 3 d dietary records, was 7510 kJ/d
(1795 kcal/d). The mean dietary intakes of grains, fruits and
vegetables were 7·6, 2·4 and 2·2 servings/d, respectively.
The mean intakes of dairy products, meat and alternatives,
and fats were 1, 4·2 and 10·2 servings/d, respectively. Dietary
energy density was 4·6 kJ/g (1·1 kcal/g). The participants
obtained 13 % of their energy from proteins, 50 % from carbo￾hydrates and 37 % from fats. Mean Na and K intakes were 2218
and 2481 mg/d, respectively.
Compliance to the DASH diet was assessed through dietary
records as well as quantification of serum vitamin C levels.

The energy-adjusted dietary intakes of the participants
throughout the run-in period and the intervention phases
are shown in Fig. 1. Mean dietary energy intakes were not
significantly different between the two groups during the
intervention (DASH: 6788·1 (SE 269·4) kJ/d (1622·4
(SE 64·4) kcal/d) v. UDA: 7078·1 (SE 297·5) kJ/d (1691·7 (SE
71·1) kcal/d), P¼0·31). During the DASH phase, the partici￾pants consumed higher amounts of carbohydrates, Ca, K
and dietary fibre and lower amounts of fats, saturated fats
and Na compared with the UDA phase (all P values ,0·05).
The participants also tended to consume higher amounts of
fruits and vegetables (P¼0·06) and vitamin C (P¼0·08) in
the DASH phase than in the UDA phase. Dietary energy den￾sity was significantly lower during the DASH phase than
during the UDA phase (4·1 (SE 0·0) v. 5·0 (SE 0·0) kJ/g (1·0
(SE 0·0) v. 1·2 (SE 0·0) kcal/g), respectively, P¼0·01). Serum
vitamin C levels also tended to be higher in the DASH phase
than in the UDA phase (860 (SE 104) v. 663 (SE 76) ng/l,
respectively, P¼0·06). The change in vitamin C levels in the
DASH phase was 168 (SE 129) and it was 2138 (SE 97) ng/l
in the UDA phase. Comparison of the changes between the
two groups revealed a borderline significant difference
(P¼0·06). All these data indicate a relatively good compliance
of the participants to the DASH eating plan.
Findings from the physical activity records revealed that the
activity levels of the participants were not significantly differ￾ent when comparing the two intervention phases (mean
physical activity in the DASH phase: 32·8 (SE 0·5) metabolic
equivalents-h/d and that in the UDA phase: 32·7 (SE 0·4)
metabolic equivalents-h; P¼0·85)
The effects of recommendations to follow the DASH diet v.
UDA on anthropometric measures and blood pressure (BP)
are summarised in Table 3. Recommendations to follow the
DASH diet resulted in a significant reduction in BMI and
waist circumference, while UDA led to a significant decrease
in waist circumference only. However, changes in weight,
waist circumference and BMI were not significantly different
between the two phases. Recommendations to follow the
DASH diet did not considerably influence SBP (P¼0·82) and
DBP (P¼0·21), whereas during the UDA phase, the partici￾pants experienced a significant increase in SBP (P¼0·04)
and DBP (P¼0·01). Although changes in SBP between the
two phases were not statistically significant (P¼0·13), the
alterations in DBP were significant (P¼0·01); that is,
recommendations to follow the DASH diet prevented the
increase in DBP compared with the usual recommendations.
The effects of recommendations to follow the DASH diet on
the features of the MetS are given in Table 4. Plasma concen￾trations of fasting blood glucose and serum lipid profiles were
not affected by the recommendations to follow the DASH diet.
However, these recommendations resulted in a significant
decrease in serum insulin levels (P¼0·04) and a non-signifi￾cant reduction in the HOMA-IR score (P¼0·12). However,
when we compared the changes in fasting blood glucose,
serum lipid and insulin levels and HOMA-IR score between
the two phases, we failed to find a significant difference.
The effects of recommendations to follow the DASH diet on
the prevalence of the MetS and its components are presented
in Table 5. Despite a slight decline in the prevalence of the
MetS and its features, we failed to find a significant effect of
recommendations to follow the DASH diet on most of its fea￾tures. Compared with UDA, recommendations to follow the
DASH diet resulted in a significant reduction in the prevalence
of the MetS and high blood pressure.
For most MetS-related variables, we found no evidence of a
carry-over effect, except for DBP, for which we observed a sig￾nificant carry-over effect from period 1 to period 2 (P¼0·03).
Discussion
In the present randomised cross-over clinical trial, we found
that recommendations to follow the DASH diet among chil￾dren, compared with UDA, resulted in improved diet quality
and reduced the prevalence of the MetS and high blood
pressure. No other significant effects were observed for the
recommendations to follow the DASH diet compared with
UDA. To our knowledge, the present study is the first one
to examine the effects of recommendations to follow the
DASH diet on the MetS and its features in adolescents.
Along with increasing prevalence of childhood obesity, the
prevalence of the MetS is rising among children and adoles￾cents. This syndrome would in turn lead to increased rates
of type 2 diabetes mellitus and CVD among youths. Therefore,
the management of childhood MetS is an important priority for
health care systems at individual and population levels.
Weight reduction is the cornerstone in the management of
the MetS; however, weight loss is generally not recommended
for children since childhood is a period of rapid growth and
development. The suitable dietary approach for childhood
MetS is still a matter of discussion mainly due to scarcity of
data. We hypothesised the DASH dietary pattern to be a suit￾able choice for improving the features of childhood MetS that
could maintain the weight of children and provide adequate
nutrients for their growth and development. In the present
study, compared with UDA for childhood MetS, recommen￾dations to follow the DASH diet resulted in significant
reductions in dietary energy density and intakes of saturated
fats and Na along with increased intakes of K, Ca, dietary
fibre, fruits, vegetables and vitamin C.
In the present study, we observed a significant favourable
effect of recommendations to follow the DASH diet on the
prevalence of the MetS and high BP. This finding is in line
with those of earlier studies on adolescents that have reported
the beneficial effects of the components of the DASH diet on
the MetS. The results of the National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey 1999–2002 revealed that the Healthy
Eating Index and fruit scores were associated with a lower
prevalence of the MetS in US adolescents(28). Fibre-rich,
nutrient-dense, plant-based foods have also been inversely
associated with the prevalence of childhood MetS(29). In a
cross-sectional study among 2130 youths with type 1 diabetes,
Liese et al.(30) found that the greater adherence to the DASH
diet was inversely associated with the LDL:HDL ratio and gly￾cated Hb. However, they failed to find significant associations
with serum TAG and LDL-cholesterol levels.

In the present study, recommendations to follow the DASH
diet, compared with UDA, prevented the rise in DBP, but did
not affect SBP. This finding is in contrast to those of the pre￾vious studies that reported the significant effect of the DASH
eating pattern on SBP, not on DBP, among children(22,31).
This difference in findings might be explained by study
methodologies. Both the mentioned studies used a parallel
design and their participants were pre-hypertensive, hyperten￾sive or healthy children. In a parallel study among adults with
the MetS, Azadbakht et al.(14) demonstrated a significant
improvement in all the features of the MetS after a 6-month
intervention with the DASH diet. The major difference
between the present study and that of Azadbakht et al.(14) is
that we did not prescribe weight loss diets for adolescents,
while they prescribed a weight-reducing DASH diet. In
another study, adherence to the DASH diet by adult patients
with type 2 diabetes led to a significant reduction in body
weight, waist circumference, fasting blood glucose, glycated
Hb, LDL-cholesterol levels, and both SBP and DBP after 8
weeks. Although this study had a cross-over design, significant
weight reduction of diabetic patients might be responsible for
metabolic improvements(32). Furthermore, we found a reason￾able acceptability of the DASH diet by adolescents in the
present study; however, due to the age group of the study par￾ticipants, the dietary adherence might not be perfect. Better
adherence might have resulted in significant reductions in
glucose and lipid profiles in earlier studies among adults. As
the adherence to the DASH diet was not completely achieved
in the present study, one might not attribute the effects to the
changes in nutrient intakes. There is the possibility that the
observed effects on blood pressure and the overall MetS
may have been due to the within-group significant reduction
in BMI and waist circumference in the DASH diet group. It
must be noted that the two groups were not significantly
different in terms of dependent variables at study baseline.
Although the participants met the criteria for the MetS, they
were not on the upper end of abnormal cut-points for the fea￾tures of the MetS, which might reduce the chance of achieving
significant changes in these features following the interven￾tion. For example, mean baseline fasting plasma glucose
values were less than 900 mg/l and almost 90 % of the partici￾pants had normal values. Moreover, dietary intakes of the par￾ticipants in the run-in period revealed that they were eating a
relatively nutrient-dense diet with fairly high amounts of fruits
and vegetables. Their diet had a high content of K as well as a
low content of Na, which might contribute to the non-signifi￾cant changes in the dependent variables after the intervention.
The mechanisms through which the DASH diet affects meta￾bolic health are largely unknown and still a matter for
research. Several possibilities have been suggested: the high
contents of K, Mg and fibre in the DASH eating pattern may
explain the beneficial effects on metabolic profiles(33,34). The
low Na content in this diet can also explain the improvements
in BP(35). While controversial(36), Ca might also have modest
BP-lowering effects(37). Higher intakes of legumes(9) and
dairy products(20) and lower intakes of saturated fats(38) can
account for the beneficial effects of the DASH diet on meta￾bolic parameters. In the present trial, vitamin C intake also
tended to be higher in the DASH group than in the UDA
group. Dietary intake of vitamin C has been suggested to
lower BP by enhancing NO synthase activity(39,40). Estimated
folate consumption was also greater in the DASH group
than in the UDA group. Several studies have indicated the
lipid- and BP-lowering effects of folate(41,42). Furthermore, as
the DASH diet contains lower amounts of refined sugar, this
would in turn help to prevent metabolic abnormalities(43).
Most probably, the DASH diet exerts its beneficial effects
through a combination of these factors and not just by a
single dietary factor(21).
The present findings must be interpreted in the context of
some limitations. We used serum vitamin C levels and dietary
records to assess the dietary compliance of adolescents. These

are not perfect tools for assessing the adherence to the DASH
diet. Having the cycle menus available might influence the
food records and the participants might record what they
knew they were supposed to consume based on their cycle
menus. Finding a suitable biomarker for adherence to dietary
patterns, in particular, to the DASH diet, can be considered in
future investigations. We confined the study participants to
girls; therefore, the findings cannot be extrapolated to all ado￾lescents. Furthermore, since the Iranian food composition
database was not complete, we had to use the USDA food
composition database, which encompasses some enriched
foods and might overestimate vitamin C, Fe and dietary fibre
contents for Iranian foods. In addition, in the present study,
the participants were given recommendations to follow the
DASH diet (rather than being fed the diet). This might result
in imperfect adherence to the DASH diet. Non-achievement
of all the DASH goals by our participants (such as 15–16 g
of dietary fibre/4184 kJ (1000 kcal)) might contribute to the
non-significant changes in dependent variables.
In conclusion, recommendations to follow the DASH diet
for 6 weeks among adolescent girls with the MetS, compared
with UDA, reduced the prevalence of high blood pressure and
the MetS and improved diet quality. No significant changes
were found in glucose and lipid profiles. This type of healthy
diet can be considered as a treatment modality for the MetS
and its components in children.
