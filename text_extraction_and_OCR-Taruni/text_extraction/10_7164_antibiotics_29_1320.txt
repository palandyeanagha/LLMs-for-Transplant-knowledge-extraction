 Moderate concentrations of bredinin (1.2 x 10-; M) strongly inhibited growth of L5178Y 
cells, with the effect being reversed by guanylic acid (GMP). However, at higher concentra￾tions of bredinin the inhibition was not reversed completely by GMP added in excess. Bredinin 
was cytocidal at concentrations above 2 x 10-1 M, but 5 x 10-1 M bredinin in the presence of 
excess GMP, bredinin was cytostatic. 
 Bredinin inhibited nucleic acid synthesis of L5178Y cells, but bredinin itself was not in￾corporated into the nucleic acid. Inhibition of nucleic acid synthesis was clearly reversed by 
GMP. Similarly chromosomal aberrations in L5178Y cells caused by bredinin were reversed 
by GMP. In contrast, the effect of a high concentration of bredinin on cell multiplication 
was not reversed by GMP. The modal volume of L5178Y cells increased during incubation 
in the presence of bredinin and GMP for 24 hours, 5 x 10-1 M bredinin with GMP causing a 
70% increase in cell volume. This increase in cell volume was mainly due to an increase in the 
protein content of the cells. 
 The cytostatic effect of bredinin with GMP was reversed completely by adenosine-3',5'-
cyclic monophosphate (cyclic AMP). Other cyclic nucleotides and nucleotides were ineffec￾tive. The reversing effect of cyclic AMP on cell survival depended upon the concentration of 
GMP, and was not seen in the absence of GMP. It was concluded that cyclic AMP influences 
the secondary cytostatic effect of bredinin, and not the primary cytotoxic effect reversed by 
GMP.
 As reported in previous papers' 2,,,, the new antibiotic bredinin (4-carbamoyl-l-/3-n-ribofuranosyl 
imidazolium-5-olate) is a derivative of AICA-riboside. Bredinin strongly inhibits the growth of tumor 
cells in tissue culture, this inhibition being reversed by GMP. The cytolytic activity of bredinin is 
due to inhibition of the conversion of IMP to GMP in the purine nucleotide biosynthetic pathway. 
 GMP does not completely reverse the inhibitory activity of high concentrations of bredinin, an 
observation explained by bredinin acting at another site. This paper reports studies exploring the 
secondary effect of bredinin on L5178Y cells. 
 Materials and Methods 
 Bredinin was obtained as described previously". Other materials were purchased as follows: 
adenosine-3',5'-cyclic monophosphate from Sigma Chemical Company, St. Louis, U.S.A.; 3H-thymidine 
and 3H-uridine from New England Nuclear. 14C-Bredinin (2.12 mCi/mM) was synthesized in our labora￾tory by the method described previously4'. 
 The mouse leukemia cell line, L5178Y, was grown at 37°C in FISCHER'S medium supplemented with 
10% dialyzed bovine serum, penicillin and streptomycin. In this medium, the L5178Y cells grew 
logarithmically, with a generation time of about 11 hours until they reached a cell density of 101 cells/ml. 
FISCHER'S medium and colcemid for chromosome study were purchased from Grand Island Biology 
Co., Ltd., U.S.A. Bovine serum was prepared in our laboratory. Routine tests for Mycoplasma in 
the serum gave negative results.

 Cell numbers and cell volumes were determined in a Coulter model B electronic particle counter. 
The percentage of cultured cells that survived various treatments was determined by comparing cell 
numbers with those obtained under control conditions. 
 Growth rate was calculated using the following equations: 
 log cell count after incubation for 40 hours with test material 
 Growth rate (%) -_ cell count at the start of experiment 
 o° control cell count after incubation for 40 hours 
 cell count at the start of experiment 
 The syntheses of DNA and RNA in L5178Y cells were determined by measuring the incorporation 
of thymidine-3H (I,uCi/ml) and uridine-3H (1,uCi/ml), respectively into cold 20% TCA-insoluble pre￾cipitates. The precipitates were washed twice with 5 % TCA and 1 % sodium pyrophosphate, once with 
ethanol - ether (1: 1, v/v), once with ether, and then air dried. Radioactivity was then measured in a 
liquid scintillation counter after addition of 9 ml of toluene with POPOP (0.01 g/liter) and POP (6 
g/liter). 
 For examination of chromosomal aberrations, cultures of L5178Y cells were incubated for 24 
hours with the test compounds treated with 0.005 /cg/ml of colcemid and fixed. Chromosomal pre￾parations were obtained by the standard method, involving treatment with I % sodium citrate, fixation 
in methanol - acetic acid (3: 1, v/v), drying in air, and GIEmtsA staining. 
 The protein content of L5178Y cells was determined by the method of LowRY et a1.5>. Variations in 
the amounts of protein per cell were estimated by the method of KURODA and FURUYAMA6>. 
 Results and Discussion 
 L5178Y cells were incubated for 40 hours in FtscHER's medium containing various concentrations 
of bredinin, with or without 2 x 10-' M GMP. After incubation, cell numbers were determined. As 
shown in Fig. 1 growth of the cells was completely inhibited by 10'5 M bredinin, but with 10-5 M 
bredinin and 4 x 10-6 M GMP there was essentially no decrease in the viable count. However, at a higher 
concentration of bredinin (5 x 10-5 M), the growth inhibitory effect was not reversed by GMP, even
when excess GMP was added. 
 As described previously"), the effect of GMP 
in preventing growth inhibition increased up to 
a fixed concentration (4x 10-b M) of GMP with 
higher concentrations of GMP having no further 
protective effect, irrespective of how much bred￾inin was added to the culture medium. There￾fore, the results indicate that at the higher con￾centrations, bredinin attacks some site other than 
that protected by GMP.

Bredinin clearly exerts a cytotoxic effect on the 
cells in the absence of GMP. Cell survival on 40-
hour incubation after 16-hour exposure to vari￾ous concentration of bredinin decreased greatly 
with increasing concentrations of bredinin. No 
cells survived incubation with 2 x 10-5 M bredinin.

In contrast, the survival of cells exposed to 5 ; 
10-5M bredinin approached 100% in the presence 
of GMP (4>C 10-5 M). This observation suggests 
that bredinin has a cytostatic action on L5178Y 
cells when acting on a site not protected by GMP. 
 We reported previously) that 5 >; 10-5 M 
bredinin strongly inhibited the synthesis of nucleic 
acids, and that the syntheses of DNA and RNA 
were inhibited to a similar extent. Inhibition of 
nucleic acid synthesis was reversed by GMP pre￾serving cell viability but not reversing growth in￾hibition. Synthesis of macromolecule in the pre￾sence of growth inhibition was confirmed in experi￾ments on chromosomal abnormalities.
 The percentages of L5178Y cells 
with abnormal chromosomes after 24-
hour exposure to either 10-5 M or 10-1 M 
bredinin are given in Table 1. GMP 
reduced the chromosomal aberrations 
that occurred in the presence of 10-4 M 
bredinin, a concentration that inhibits 
cell growth, but also at the higher 
bredinin concentration of 10_; M. This 
observation indicates that synthesis of 
macromolecules continued for at least
24 hours even though cell numbers remained essentially constant. Considering that bredinin is a 
nucleoside antibiotic that acts primarily like an antimetabolite by blocking the conversion of IMP to 
GMP, the secondary site of action seems unique. 
 11C-Bredinin was added to exponentially growing cultures of L5178Y cells at a final concentration 
of 0.1 /tCi/ml with the 3H-labeled precursors thymidine and uridine. Fig. 3 shows that over a 5-hour 
period thymidine (Fig. 3A) and uridine (Fig. 3B) were incorporated linearly into the nucleic acids of 
L5178Y cells, while scarcely any labeled bredinin was incorporated. GMP was not present in the

 Furthermore we were unable to find bredinin-5'-phosphate or phosphoryl bredinin in the cells. 
These facts suggest that in the presence of GMP, nucleic acids are not damaged by lack of GMP as 
precursor or by insertion of bredinin into the molecules. 
 The continuing production of macromolecules in the absence of an increase in cell numbers when 
cells are incubated in the presence of 5 X 10-6 M bredinin and 4>' 10-6 M GMP predict that cell hyper￾trophy is occurring. Results of a study examining this premise are shown in Fig. 4. The size distribution 
of cells was measured in a Coulter Model B electronic particle counter with a reciprocal amplitude 
setting of 32, a reciprocal aperture current setting of 1, a tube of 100 p diameter, and counting windows
equal to 5 scale units. Size distributions of cells 
24 hours after addition of 4X 10-b M GMP, of 
5x10-1m bredinin and of 5X10-IM bredinin 
plus 4 Y. 10-6 M GMP are given in Figs. 4A, 4B 
and 4C respectively. 
 Addition of bredinin together with GMP re￾sulted in about a 70 % increase in volume. GMP 
alone caused little swelling, while bredinin alone 
caused rather less swelling than bredinin plus 
GMP. Furthermore, in the presence of both 
compounds, the cells did not die for at least 24 
hours although cell growth was inhibited com￾pletely, as demonstrated in Fig. 2. 
 The effects of several antitumor agents',a,t,10) 
on cell size have been studied, and the rates of 
swelling reported were similar to the rate ob￾served with bredinin plus GMP. It was at first 
thought possible that bredinin might cause nieta￾Fig. 4. Effects of continuous exposure to bredinin

phase arrest, with an increase of the mitotic 
index. However, our results did not agree 
with expected values for this. Therefore, it 
is concluded that bredinin does not inhibit 
the mitotic apparatus, like colchicine, or 
induce metaphase arrest. It is interesting 
that GMP alone also caused a slight swel￾ling of the cells. 
 The reason for the increase in cell volume
then was examined. The results obtained on the amount of protein in cells after treatment with 
bredinin with and without GMP (Table 2) suggest that hypertrophy of the cell volume is due in 
part to an increase in the amount of protein present. Probably an increase in the amounts of other 
macromolecules such as nucleic acid also occurs. These observations suggest that bredinin does not 
affect membrane transport of the cells since uptake of precursors required for synthesis of macromole￾cules is obviously occurring. In the presence of GMP alone, the amount of protein did not increase. 
 We investigated the distribution of L5178Y cells based on cell size for 48 hours after addition of 
4 x 10-5 M GMP, 5 X 10-5 M bredinin or both, and also after exposure to these compounds for 24 hours 
and then incubation in normal FiscHER's medium for 24 hours. Although the presence of GMP for 48 
hours did not result in swelling or lysis of the cells, the cells in medium containing bredinin lysed. 
When cells had been exposed to bredinin plus GMP for 24 hours and then incubated for 24 hours in 
normal F1scHER's medium, the size distribution of cells was identical with that of cells in control 
cultures. On the other hand, all cells incubated for 24 hours in FISCHER's medium after exposure to 
2 y, 10-5 M bredinin alone for 24 hours, also lysed, so that their size distribution could not be measured. 
These results indicate that in the presence of 10-' M bredinin plus 4X 10-5 M GMP most cells do not 
undergo irreversible damage within at least 24 hours. As mentioned above, several antitumor agents 
cause irreversible damage of cells, and result in moderate swelling like that seen with bredinin alone, 
but unlike the extensive hypertrophy observed with bredinin plus GMP. The large increase in cell size 
in the presence of l0-' M bredinin and 4;; 10-SM GMP must be the result of a continuation of the synthe￾sis of macromolecules in the absence of cell growth. 
 Several studies' 1,2'13' have established that cyclic AMP as well as compounds that raise the intra￾cellular level of cyclic AMP can cause morphological enlargement of certain cell lines in tissue culture. 
These reports suggest that the changes in morphology induced by alteration of the cyclic AMP level

could be due to inhibition of DNA synthesis. Although bredinin with GMP did not prevent DNA 
synthesis by the cells, the combination exerted a cytostatic effect similar to that of cyclic AMP. 
 Reversal of the effect of bredinin/GMP treatment was investigated with the results shown in Fig. 
5. It was found that with the combination of 8 x 10-5 M bredinin, 4 x, 10-5 M GMP, and 100 ,(ug/ml 
cyclic AMP there was no decrease in the growth rate (Fig. 5A). However, in the absence of GMP, 
the effect of bredinin was not completely reversed by cyclic AMP because of cytotoxicity of cyclic 
AMP. Cyclic AMP is known to inhibit cell divisionl4l and, in the presence of GMP, cell survival was 
maintained by a cyclic AMP concentration at 100 /tg/ml (Fig. 5A). Cyclic GMP also prevented the 
effect of bredinin, with its reversing potential approximately identical with that of GMP alone (Fig. 
5B). Cyclic GMP was probably used by the cells as a substitute for GMP. The other cyclic nucleotides 
and nucleotides tested were ineffective. 
 The interrelationships of bredinin, GMP and cyclic AMP on cell growth are shown in Fig. 6. Cells 
were incubated for 40 hours in the presence of 8 x 10_5 M bredinin and various concentrations of GMP 
and cyclic AMP (Fig. 6A), and with 100 jig/ml cyclic AMP and various concentrations of bredinin 
and GMP (Fig. 6B). In the presence of 8 x 10-5 M bredinin, concentrations of both 25 #g/ml cyclic 
AMP and 4x. 10-' M GMP were required to prevent growth inhibition, with lower concentrations of 
either GMP or cyclic AMP giving less protection (Fig. 6A). In contrast, the reversal of growth in￾hibition by the combination of GMP and cyclic AMP was not dependent on the concentration of 
bredinin (Fig. 6B). Therefore, it is concluded that cyclic AMP reverses the effect of bredinin as a func￾tion of GMP concentration because cyclic AMP prevents the action of bredinin on a site other than that 
protected by GMP. Possibly, bredinin together with GMP reduces the intracellular cyclic AMP level. 
 The hypothesis that bredinin plus GMP reduces the intracellular cyclic AMP level was confirmed 
by determining the concentration of cyclic AMP in cells using a cyclic AMP assay kit (The Radio￾chemical Centre, Amersham, England). A decrease in the cyclic AMP content of L5178Y cells on 
exposure to 8 x 10 M bredinin and 4 x 10-' M GMP was detected after 30 minutes and continued 
linearly for the next 60 minutes (Fig. 7). GMP alone had little or no effect. These results support the

effects of various concentrations of bredinin and GMP

hypothesis that bredinin and GMP operate by reducing intracellular cyclic AMP since a constant level 
of cyclic AMP is required for cell division. 
 The primary mode of action of bredinin is blockage of the conversion of IMP to GMP='. The sec￾ondary effect appears to be concerned with interference with the intracellular cyclic AMP level. Cell 
enlargement must be due to inhibition of cell division only and not to inhibition of synthesis of DNA, 
RNA and protein. Although cyclic AMP has been reported to cause cell enlargement, the changes 
observed are similar to those caused by other compounds that inhibit cell division, and are not unique 
effects of cyclic AMP"'. Therefore, it appears that the decrease of the intracellular cyclic AMP level 
results in inhibition of cell division, followed by cell enlargement. 
 Bredinin has a significant immunosuppressive effect, causing a decrease in the number of leuco￾cytes". However the decrease in the number of leucocytes is less than that caused by other immuno￾suppressive agents. The secondary site of action of bredinin observed in cell culture may be directly 
related to the suppression of the immunoresponse in rats. The serum concentration of bredinin after 
oral administration of an effective dose for immunosuppression is more than 8 X 10-' M. Furthermore, 
GMP in the serum will partially reverse the primary site of action (Experiments on the reversal in tissue 
culture were carried out with dialyzed bovine serum). 
 If the immunoresponse is depressed by the cytostatic effect related to reduction of cellular cyclic 
AMP levels, it is easy to understand why the decrease in the number of leucocytes observed was less 
than that observed with other inhibitors of cell division. Further studies on the effects of bredinin will 
be reported in the near future.
