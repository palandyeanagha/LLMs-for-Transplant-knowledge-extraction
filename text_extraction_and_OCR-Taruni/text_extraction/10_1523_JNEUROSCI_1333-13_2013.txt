The decline of cognitivefunction has emerged as one ofthe greatest healththreats of old age. Age-related cognitive decline is caused by an
impacted neuronal circuitry, yet the molecular mechanisms responsible are unknown. C1q, the initiating protein of the classical com￾plement cascade and powerful effector ofthe peripheral immune response, mediates synapse elimination inthe developing CNS. Here we
showthat C1q protein levels dramatically increase inthe normal aging mouse and human brain, by as much as 300-fold. This increase was
predominantly localized in close proximity to synapses and occurred earliest and most dramatically in certain regions of the brain,
including some but not all regions known to be selectively vulnerable in neurodegenerative diseases, i.e., the hippocampus, substantia
nigra, and piriform cortex. C1q-deficient mice exhibited enhanced synaptic plasticity in the adult and reorganization of the circuitry in
the aging hippocampal dentate gyrus. Moreover, aged C1q-deficient mice exhibited significantly less cognitive and memory decline in
certain hippocampus-dependent behavior tests compared with their wild-type littermates. Unlike in the developing CNS, the comple￾ment cascade effector C3 was only present at very low levels in the adult and aging brain. In addition, the aging-dependent effect of C1q
on the hippocampal circuitry was independent of C3 and unaccompanied by detectable synapse loss, providing evidence for a novel,
complement- and synapse elimination-independent role for C1q in CNS aging.
Introduction
Cognitive decline is one of the greatest health threats for the aging
population (Bishop et al., 2010) and is caused by synaptic mal￾function and/or synapse loss, rather than the loss of neurons per
se (Yankner et al., 2008). The molecular mechanisms driving
cognitive aging, in particular the ones that drive the synaptic
changes are, however, unknown. Rapidly growing evidence im￾plicates molecules formerly believed to exclusively serve immune
functions in a wide variety of CNS functions (Boulanger, 2009;
Elmer and McAllister, 2012; Stephan et al., 2012). For instance,
the classical complement cascade, initiated by the pattern￾recognition molecule C1q, which is a powerful effector of the
innate immune system and responsible for pathogen targeting
and removal (Ricklin et al., 2010). We recently found that C1q
helps to mediate developmental CNS synapse elimination
through classical complement activation which is crucial for fine￾tuning the visual system circuitry (Stevens et al., 2007). Further￾more, C1q was shown to also act independently of classical
complement, contributing to neuroprotection in the CNS
(Benoit and Tenner, 2011; Benoit et al., 2013).
As C1q and the classical complement cascade are strongly
activated in Alzheimer’s disease (Stephan et al., 2012), a disease of
old age that is marked by massive synapse loss, here we investi￾gated whether C1q also plays a role in the cognitive decline of
normal brain aging.

(C57BL/6) have no C1q protein and disrupted classical complement
activity (Botto et al., 1998). C3-deficient mice (C57BL/6), generated by
homologous recombination targeting the coding sequence (nt 1850 –
2214) of the C3 gene, were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory (B6
129S4-C3tmCrr/J; stock No. 003641). Young C57BL/6 mice, includ￾ing the C57BL/6 mice used as strain-matched control for behavioral
assays, were obtained from Charles Rivers Laboratories, and aged
C57BL/6 mice were obtained from the National Institute on Aging.
Cx3CR1-GFP knock-in mice (The Jackson Laboratory; B6.129P￾Cx3cr1tm1Litt/J, stock No. 005582) were crossed with C57BL/6 mice to
maintain the line and to obtain heterozygous mice (Cx3CR1-GFP /)
used in the analyses presented. Animals were housed under pathogen-free
conditions and handled according to laboratory animal care program
(APLAC) guidelines at Stanford University, based on the National Institutes
of HealthGuide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Genotypes of all
transgenic, knock-in or knock-out mice used were confirmed before and
after experiments by PCR genotyping.
Human tissue. Brain specimens from both infant and aged donors were
removed during autopsy and hippocampal tissues (at the level of lateral
geniculate nucleus) were dissected by a neuropathologist. All specimens
were collected with permits and in accordance with the University of
California San Francisco Committee on Human Research. Tissue blocks
were immersed in 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS for 48 h at
4°C. The tissues were then cryoprotected sequentially by 10 and 30%
(w/v) sucrose in PBS at 4°C. After cryoprotection, tissues were embedded
in OCT and cut at 12 m thickness. Sections were stored at 80°C until
use.
Rabbit anti-mouse C1q monoclonal antibody production. Mouse C1q
was purified from normal mouse serum (Genetex) as previously de￾scribed (Li et al., 2008), with the following additions. After purification
by ion exchange chromatography (BioRex70, Bio-Rad) and before the
affinity chromatography step (heparin-agarose, Bio-Rad), concentrated
mouse C1q was applied to a size-exclusion chromatography column
(sepharose 6B, GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 50 mM Tris pH 7.3, 400
mM NaCl, 25 mM EDTA. Fractions positive for C1q by hemolytic titer
were pooled, concentrated by ultrafiltration, and buffer was exchanged
into 50 mM Tris pH 7.3, 150 mM NaCl.
Immunization of rabbits with purified mouse C1q and subsequent
cloning of anti-C1q antibody producing hybridoma cells was done by
Epitomics. Antibody-producing hybridoma clones were further selected
by ELISA screening and individual antibody clones were further selected
and characterized by SDS-PAGE and immunohistochemistry.
Mouse perfusion. Mice were anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine and
transcardially perfused with Dulbeccos PBS (Invitrogen) according to
APLAC guidelines at Stanford University, based on the NIH Guide for the
Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, until tissue was completely cleared of
blood traces. If tissue fixation was required, the animals were additionally
perfused with 10 ml 4% PFA/PBS solution. Mice were decapitated im￾mediately after perfusion and brain tissue was carefully extracted and
further processed (see below).
Immunohistochemistry staining and data analysis. Perfusion-fixed
brains were additionally immersion-fixed with 4% PFA for 3 or 16 h at
4°C, dependent on the individual experimental requirements. The fixed
brains were briefly rinsed in PBS before sunken in 30% sucrose/PBS
solution at 4°C. Subsequently, 30 m sections were produced with a
freezing-sliding microtome and stored in PBS including 0.05% NaN3 at
4°C. For immunohistochemistry analysis, sections were blocked in
sterile-filtered antibody buffer (150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris base, 1% BSA,
100 mM L-lysine, 0.2% TX-100, pH 7.4) containing additional 2% BSA
for 45 min and then transferred into primary antibody-containing anti￾body buffer for overnight to 3 d incubation at 4°C. Primary antibodies
used: rabbit anti-mouse C1q monoclonal antibody (clones 4.8 and 27.10
at 1.0 g/ml, Epitomics/Abcam), rabbit anti-human C1q (1:1000,
Dako), mouse anti-synaptophysin (1:1000, Millipore), mouse anti￾gephyrin (1:500, Synaptic Systems), guinea-pig anti-VGluT1 (1:1000,
Millipore), guinea-pig anti-VGAT (1:250, Synaptic Systems), guinea-pig
anti-GABA (1:500, abcam), mouse anti-NeuN (1:500, Millipore),
chicken anti-GFP (1:1000, Abcam). After several washes in PBS, sec￾tions were incubated with adequate fluorescence-conjugated secondary
antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch) for 2 h to overnight at room
temperature in darkness. After washing with PBS, sections were
mounted on glass slides, using VectaShield mounting medium (Vector
Laboratories) and 0.17 mm thick glass coverslips. Stained tissue was
subsequently analyzed with a Zeiss AxioImager wide field microscope or
a Zeiss LSM 710 confocal microscope. Images from C1q-deficient and
wild-type littermate mice, as well as tissue analyzed for the time course
series were recorded under identical conditions and were postprocessed
with Photoshop (Adobe) with identical settings. Signal quantification
was performed with ImageJ 1.47f (NIH) on unprocessed image sections.
Significance was determined with GraphPad Prism 5 using unpaired (see
Figs. 1, 3, and 6) or paired (see Fig. 4), two-tailed t tests.
Tissue preparation for Western blotting. Perfused mouse brains or hu￾man hippocampal samples were homogenized on ice in sample buffer
(50 mM HEPES, 5 mM CaCl2,1mM MgCl2, 145 mM NaCl, pH 7.4)
containing protease inhibitor cocktails (Sigma). If required, mouse
hippocampi were dissected in ice-cold PBS, homogenized and lysed
for 1 h in sample buffer, containing 0.5% NP-40 (Pierce) at 4°C. Large
debris was removed by centrifugation at 1000  g for 5 min and
supernatant samples were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored
at 80°C until use.
Crude synaptosomal preparation. Crude synaptosomes were prepared
as described by Stephan et al. (2008). In brief, isolated hippocampi were
homogenized with a glass-Teflon homogenizer (800 rpm, 12 strokes) in
synaptosome buffer (320 mM sucrose, protease inhibitors, in 5 mM
HEPES, pH 7.5) and centrifuged at 1000  g for 5 min. The resulting
supernatant was further centrifuged at 12,000  g for 20 min to produce
the crude synaptosomal pellet (P2) and synapse-free supernatant frac￾tion (S2). The P2 was resuspended in buffer and both S2 and P2 were
snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at 80°C until Western blot
analysis.
SDS-PAGE, Western blotting, and signal quantification. Protein con￾centrations were determined by Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad) and
SDS samples were prepared with standard Laemmli buffer. Dependent
on tissue and antibody used, 15–35 g of protein were loaded onto
4 –15% TGX precast gels (Bio-Rad), separated by SDS-PAGE and subse￾quently transferred to polyvinylidene fluorid membranes (Immobilon P
membrane, Millipore), according to the manufacturer’s guidelines. The
membranes were dried and then incubated with primary antibodies in
Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST) and 2.5% West￾ern blocking reagent (Roche) for 90 min at room temperature. Primary
antibodies used: goat anti-mouse C1q (1:50, Santa Cruz Biotechnology),
goat anti-mouse C3 (1:1000, MP Biomedical), rabbit anti-PSD-95 (1:
250, Invitrogen), goat anti-mouse IgG/IgM (1 g/ml, Jackson Immu￾noResearch), mouse anti--actin (1:2000, Abcam), mouse anti--
tubulin (1:2000, Abcam), rabbit anti-GAPDH (1:2000, Abcam). After
washing with TBST, the blots were incubated for 45 min with peroxidase￾conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch), and washed
again. Immunoreactive protein bands were detected using the ECL-plus kit
(GE Healthcare). Signals were acquired using a FluorChemQ CCD system
(ProteinSimple) and analyzed using the manufacturer’s software. For rep￾robing, membranes were incubatedfor 20 min in stripping solution (Pierce)
and were afterward extensively washed in TBST before incubation with pri￾mary antibodies. For Western blot quantifications, signal intensities of pro￾teins from at least three different animals per genotype or age were
normalized to the -tubulin or -actin loading control for each individual
sample and significance was determined with GraphPad Prism 5 using un￾paired, two-tailed t test.
Histology (Golgi analysis). Golgi staining of mouse brains was prepared
according to the manufacturer’s protocol (FD Rapid GolgiStain kit, FD
Neurotechnologies) and subsequently cut into 170 m sections using a
freezing/sliding microtome. Sections containing the hippocampus were
mounted on 0.1% gelatin-coated (Sigma-Aldrich) glass slides, dried, and
stored at room temperature until 0.175 m serial-section analysis using
an AxioImager wide-field microscope (63 objective, Zeiss). Tissue sec￾tions were digitally reconstructed and tertiary dentate gyrus granule cell
dendrites were identified and manually traced in Neurolucida (MBF
Bioscience). Dendritic spines were manually identified, counted, and
Stephan et al. • C1q in CNS Aging J. Neurosci., August 14, 2013 • 33(33):13460 –13474 • 13461

quantified as number of spines per micrometer dendrite length (n  4
animals/genotype, nine dendrites/animal). The experimenter was blind
to animal genotypes until after all data were analyzed. Statistical signifi￾cance was determined with GraphPad Prism 5 using unpaired, two-tailed
t test.
Immunoelectron microscopy. Cryo-immunogold electron microscopy
experiments were performed based on the Tokuyasu technique
(Tokuyasu, 1980). Briefly, mice were perfused with 3% formaldehyde
followed by immersion of the brains in the same fixative with 0.025%
glutaraldehyde for 4 h. Five-hundred micrometer-thick vibratome fron￾tal sections were immersed in 2.3 M sucrose in phosphate buffer and 1
mm dentate gyrus areas were made with a scalpel. Samples were mounted
on specimen holders and immersed in liquid nitrogen. Cryosections (90
nm) were obtained with a cryo-ultramicrotome Leica EM FC6 and col￾lected on carbon-coated Formvar films on nickel grids. Immunogold
labeling was performed by incubation with rabbit anti-C1q monoclonal
antibody and anti-synaptophysin antibody for 1 h followed by washes in
PBS and incubation with secondary antibodies conjugated to 12 and 6
nm gold particles, respectively, for 1 h. After washes with PBS, grids were
contrasted with 0.3% uranyl acetate in methylcellulose for 5 min and
examined in an electron microscope Tecnai G2 Spirit (FEI).
Hippocampal physiology. Hippocampal slices were prepared by stan￾dard methods (Madison and Edson, 2001). Briefly, hippocampi were
dissected from the brains of mice, sliced in a transverse orientation using
a manual razor blade tissue slicer (Stoelting), placed onto filter paper
moistened with artificial CSF consisting of the following in mM: 119
NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 1.3 MgSO4 2.5 CaCl2, 1 Na2HPO4, 26.2 NaHCO3, and 11
glucose, in an atmosphere saturated with 95% O2/5% CO2 (carbogen).
Two hours after dissection, one slice was removed to the recording cham￾ber where it was submerged under continuously flowing artificial CSF,
containing 10 M picrotoxin and saturated with carbogen. A bipolar
metal concentric stimulating electrode (Frederick Haer) was placed in
the inner leaf of the dentate gyrus on the end farthest from hippocampal
area CA3. The electrode spanned approximately one-half the width of the
molecular layer, and was placed approximately halfway between the
granule cell layer and the hippocampal fissure. Stimuli of varying
strength and 100 s duration were delivered from an AMPI Instruments
constant-current stimulus isolation unit, to the molecular layer through
this electrode. Resulting dendritic excitatory postsynaptic field potentials
(fEPSPs) were recorded with a glass micropipette filled with 2 M NaCl
placed also in the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus closer to CA3, and
also halfway between the granule cell layer and the hippocampal fissure.
fEPSPs were recorded using an Axoclamp 2A in bridge mode, amplified
with a Brownlee Precision model 200 amplifier, and digitized at 10 kHz
using a National Instruments analog-to-digital converter. The rising
slope of each individual fEPSP was analyzed using a program specifically
written for this purpose by Eric Schaible and Paul Pavlidis (Stanford
University, Stanford, CA) in the Labview programming environment
(National Instruments). For input/output (I/O) experiments, the stim￾ulus was adjusted by increments between 0.01 and 0.7 mA. For the anal￾ysis of the relationship between the presynaptic compound action
potential (fiber volley) and the fEPSP in the molecular layer (ML), the
fiber volleys were aligned by binning them into 19 groups according to
amplitude. An ANOVA was then run across these 19 fiber volley levels to
determine a statistical significant change in the level of fEPSP responses
between wild-type and C1q-deficient littermate animals. For paired￾pulse facilitation experiments, two stimuli were delivered, and the inter￾pulse interval was adjusted by increments from 10 to 1000 ms. For LTP
experiments, test stimuli were delivered at a rate of 1/15 s, and an ampli￾tude adjusted to give a response of 2/3 maximum, for at least 30 min
before delivery of tetanic stimulation. The tetanus consisted of 1 s dura￾tion trains of 100 Hz stimuli delivered at test intensity, four times, 15 s
apart. Following the tetanus, the stimulus frequency was returned to 1/15
s for 70 min. For paired-pulse facilitation analysis, raw fEPSP slope mea￾surements were averaged across experiments. For LTP experiments, data
points were collected in 15 s intervals and four subsequent data points
were averaged for subsequent data analysis to obtain the 1 min averages
presented. Each individual experiment was then normalized against its
own baseline. These normalized 1/min time points were then averaged
across experiments. The experimenter was blind to the genotype of the
animal until after the individual experiments were analyzed. For LTP and
I/O experiments, statistical significance was determined with a two-way
repeated-measure ANOVA. Statistical significance of paired-pulse facil￾itation data were determined with GraphPad Prism 5 using paired, two￾tailed t test.
Mouse behavior. For every experiment/age-group presented, two indi￾vidual cohorts of male mice were analyzed, each consisting of 10 –18
C1q-deficient mice and 10 –18 wild-type litter- and cage-mates; mouse
behavior modified from Faizi et al. (2012). The genotypes of all animals
were determined by PCR before and after experiments. Because of tech￾nical reasons, we were not able to analyze 3- and 17-month-old C1q
cohorts in parallel. To optimize our experiments to detect aging￾dependent defects in C1q wild-type mice, 10- to 12-week-old male
strain-matched mice (C57BL/6, Charles River Laboratories) were used as
aging-controls and a positive control in every task. All animals were
group-housed after weaning until behavioral assessment was performed
(up to five mice per cage, mixed genotypes per cage). Animals were
housed in a 12 h dark/light cycle (lights on at 8:00 P.M.), temperature￾and humidity-controlled environment with unlimited access to water
and food. All tests were conducted in the dark cycle. Experimenters were
blind to the genotype of the mice throughout testing. All animals tested
were handled by the experimenter for three d before all the behavioral
tests. In all experiments, animals were habituated to the testing room 1 h
before the tests. All experiments were in accordance with protocols ap￾proved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Stanford
University and were performed based on the National Institutes of
Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. All actions were
considered for reducing discomfort of animals during all experiments.
Open-field activity. The open-field test was used to assess locomotor
activity and exploration habits in a relatively large novel environment.
Assessment took place in a square arena (76  76 cm2
) with opaque
white walls, surrounded with privacy blinds to eliminate external room
cues. Mice were placed in the corner of the open-field arena and allowed
to freely move for 10 min while being tracked by Ethovision (Noldus
Information Technology) automated tracking system. Before each trial,
the surface of the arena was cleaned with 1% Virkon. For analysis, the
arena was divided into a central (53.5  53.5 cm2
) and a peripheral zone
(11.25 cm wide). Distance moved, velocity, and time spent in each pre￾defined zone was recorded.
Spontaneous alternation in the Y-maze. The Y-maze was used to assess
spontaneous alternation behavior. This test is based on the innate pref￾erence of rodents to explore a new environment (Gerlai, 1998; Lalonde,
2002). We compared each group of mice to chance levels which is be￾lieved to be a sensitive method of assessing working memory function
(Bertholet and Crusio, 1991; Hooper et al., 1996;Jacquelin et al., 2012). A
mouse that shows a percentage of alternation above chance level is be￾lieved to have good working memory. The Y-maze was made of solid
white plastic and consisted of two symmetrical arms and one longer arm
at 120° angles (longer arm, 20.7 cm length  12.7 cm height  7.62 cm
width; equal arms, 15.24 cm length  12.7 cm height  7.62 cm width).
At the beginning of trials, mice were placed in the center of the maze and
allowed to freely explore the three arms for 5 min. Arm entry was defined
as having all four limbs inside an arm. The maze was cleaned with 1%
Virkon between animals and before the first animal to eliminate traces of
odor. The number of arm entries and the number of triads were recorded
to calculate the alternation percentage, which was calculated by dividing
the number of triads by the number of possible alternations multiplied by
100. A triad was defined as a set of consecutive arm entries (Drew et al.,
1973; Hughes, 2004).
Morris water maze. The Morris water maze (MWM) was originally
designed to test spatial reference memory in rats by observing and re￾cording escape latency, distance moved, and velocity during the search of
a hidden escape platform in a large pool (Morris, 1984). For our test, we
used a large water tank (178 cm in diameter) filled with water at a tem￾perature of 22.0  1.5°C with a circular platform (17 cm in diameter)
placed 1 cm below the water surface and 50 cm away from the wall.
Nontoxic tempera paints (Elmers) were used to make the water opaque.
The water tank was completely surrounded by privacy blinds with at least
13462 • J. Neurosci., August 14, 2013 • 33(33):13460 –13474 Stephan et al. • C1q in CNS Aging

four visual cues attached to the blinds. Four different shapes including a
star shape, circle, rectangle, and diamond each with 6 square feet in
surface area were used as visual cues. The visual cues were located 150
cm from the center of the tank. Testing was performed under dim white
light (40 Lux at the water surface). The water tank arena was monitored
by an overhead video system that allowed Ethovision to track the mice.
During hidden platform training, a platform was positioned in one quad￾rant of the tank. Mice were released from pseudo randomized drop lo￾cations and given 60 s to find the platform. The distance to the platform
was generally the same within a day. The trial either ended when the mice
rested on the platform for 10 s or until the trial duration expired. If mice
failed to find the submerged hidden platform during that time, they were
guided to it. Mice underwent four trials of training each day (30 min
intertrial intervals) for seven consecutive days. On completion of the
hidden platform training, the platform was removed and a 60 s probe
trial was conducted. Successful learning of MWM was determined by the
gradual decrease in escape latency and discriminative quadrant explora￾tion during the probe trial. The total amount of
time spent looking for the platform per day
(maximum of 240 s: four trials  60 s each) was
used for analysis. After the probe trial, mice
were given 3 d of reversal learning during
which the platform was positioned in a differ￾ent quadrant. Following reversal training, visi￾ble platform training was performed to ensure
that no gross sensorimotor or visual deficits are
present. During the visible platform training,
the platform was marked with a black-and￾white Ping-Pong ball attached to a 10 cm
wooden stick. No mice were excluded based on
our standard exclusion criteria in this task: ex￾cessive thigmotaxis, obvious visual impair￾ment, excessive corkscrew swimming pattern,
and obvious sensorimotor dysfunction. The
water was frequently changed and the tank
disinfected.
Statistical analysis of behavior data. All data
are presented as mean  SEM and p  0.05 was
considered statistically significant. Statistical
measurements were performed with GraphPad
Prism 5. Percentage of alternation in the
Y-maze was analyzed using a one-sample t test
versus chance level (50% of alternation). Re￾peated measures two-way ANOVA was used
for evaluation of the parameters in open field,
water maze and fear conditioning. The Bonfer￾roni test was used for post hoc analysis. Paired
Student’s t test was used in the novel object
recognition test to compared the time spend
exploring the new versus the familiar object. In
all statistical analysis, the normal distribution
of the data were tested using the Kolmogorov–
Smirnov normality test.
Results
C1q protein increases dramatically in
the aging brain
To determine the amount and localiza￾tion of C1q protein at different matura￾tion stages of the murine brain, we first
generated a rabbit monoclonal antibody
to mouse C1q that enabled high affinity
detection of and absolute specificity for
C1q in immunohistochemistry (IHC) ap￾plications. Using this antibody, we found
that C1q immunoreactivity was low dur￾ing the first postnatal week, but then grad￾ually increased with maturation and aging
throughout the neuropil of the perfused mouse brain (Fig. 1A).
When normalizing to whole brain IHC signal levels from indi￾vidual postnatal day (P)6 brain slices (Fig. 1B), we found that C1q
immunoreactivity increased till the end of the second postnatal
week by approximately twofold (P15: 2.17  0.19-fold, p 
0.019; P15 vs P6), to approximately fourfold at 1 month (P30:
3.80  0.24-fold, p  0.0013; P30 vs P15), to approximately

Figure 1. C1q immunoreactivity dramatically increases with aging in the murine brain. A, Time course immunohistochemistry
of perfused mouse brain slices with our new rabbit anti-mouse C1q monoclonal antibody revealed that C1q immunoreactivity
dramatically increased with age throughout the brain. B, Quantification of C1q immunoreactivity in brain slices from early post￾natal to old aged mice confirmed that C1q immunoreactivity dramatically increases with aging in the murine brain. C1q signals,
normalizedto P6 levels (n3 brains per age;statisticalsignificance: P15 vs P6:p0.019; P30 vs P15:p0.0013; 12 months vs

sections of 1-year-old brains); nosignals were detected in C1q-deficient littermate control tissue (D).E, C1q-specificsignals in the
adult and aged brain (representative image of a brain slice from a perfused 2-year-old mouse shown) were detected throughout
the brain neuropil, except in the molecular layer of the Cerebellum (white arrowhead). C1q-positive signals were particularly
strong inthe hippocampus(blue arrowhead),the piriform cortex(yellow arrowhead), andthesubstantia nigra(red arrowhead). In
addition, locally increased C1q-immunoreactivity was detected in patches (C1q-positive patches) in many regions of the mouse

reactivity was independent of mouse gender and strain (data
not shown).
Particularly strong C1q-immunoreactivity in the adult and
aging mouse brain was detected in the piriform cortex (Fig. 1E,
yellow arrowhead), the substantia nigra (Fig. 1E, red arrowhead)
and within the hippocampus (Fig. 1E, blue arrowhead). In addi￾tion, in the adult and aged mouse brain, high levels of C1q im￾munoreactivity were also detected in patches that were found
scattered throughout the brain neuropil, each enclosing only a
few neurons (Fig. 1E, arrows). We termed these previously un￾recognized structures “C1q-positive patches” (see Fig. 3 and sec￾tion below). Interestingly, the only neuropil-region in the mouse
CNS that did not show an increase of C1q-levels with aging was
the cerebellar molecular layer (Fig. 1E, white arrowhead).
To determine the degree of increase of C1q protein levels in
the aging brain with higher sensitivity, we next performed quan￾titative Western blotting using a commercially available poly￾clonal antibody against C1q (Fig. 2A). Compared with P6, we
found that C1q levels indeed gradually increased with age in
whole brain-homogenates to 27-fold in 3-month-old mice,
then further doubled by 12 months of age and reaching maxi￾mum levels of 300-fold at 18 –24 months of age [Fig. 2B; fold￾increase/age, normalized to P6 levels: P12: 3  0.24, p  0.019
(P12 vs P6); P20: 8  0.60, p  0.0005 (P20 vs P12); P35: 12 
1.04, p  0.019 (P35 vs P20); 3.5 months: 27  3.73, p  0.043

24 months: 301  33.32, p  0.104 (24 vs 18 months), n  3
animals/age]. Serum is a major location of C1q in the periphery,
however the age-dependent increase of C1q was not an artifact of
serum contamination as serum proteins were only detected in
nonperfused brains and not in the perfused tissue used for all C1q
analyses (Fig. 2C). Furthermore, C1q IHC was not associated
with blood vessels in the CNS and we did not detect an age￾dependent increase of serum C1q levels by standard Western
blotting analysis (Fig. 2D). C3 is an effector of the classical com￾plement cascade and present in high amounts in the juvenile
mouse brain, where it is required for part of developmental syn￾apse elimination (Stevens et al., 2007). In contrast to the large
increase in C1q levels observed with aging, we found that the
levels of C3 protein in the CNS significantly decreased with age
and were present at only low levels just above the detection limit

that C1q, but not C3, protein levels in￾crease profoundly in the CNS, throughout
the brain neuropil during normal brain
maturation and aging, potentially sug￾gesting complement-independent func￾tions for C1q during normal brain aging
(Fig. 2G).
Identification of novel
C1q-positive structures
Starting in adulthood, as mentioned
above (Fig. 1E), high levels of C1q immu￾noreactivity were also detected in a previ￾ously unrecognized type of structure,
which consisted of patches of 20 –150
m diameter that were found scattered
throughout the brain neuropil, each en￾closing only a few neurons (Figs. 1E, 3A–
F). These C1q-positive patches were
highly variable in size and distribution,
and were mainly detected in the cortex,
thalamus, midbrain, and striatum but
were much less frequent in the cerebellum
and hippocampus (Figs. 1E, 3A). Quanti￾fication of C1q-immunoreactivity in
brain sections from adult and aged mice
revealed that C1q signals were increased
in C1q-positive patches by 1.58  0.07-
fold (3-month-old; p  0.0001) and
1.53  0.04-fold (24 months old; p 
0.0001), compared with outside-patch
signal intensities, and thus confirmed that
their relative intensity did not increase
with aging after their appearance in the
adult mouse brain. In contrast to C1q, the
degree of both excitatory and inhibitory
synaptic protein densities (VGluT1, Fig.
3E,G,H; VGAT, Fig. 3F–H, respectively)
in these patches was similar to that of the
nearby neuropil which argues against
C1q-positive patches being regions of in￾creased synapse loss [Fig. 3G,H; immuno￾reactivity inside patch vs outside patch
region; VGluT1: 1.01  0.02-fold (3-
month-old; p  0.68) and 1.03  0.02-
fold (24 months old; p  0.25); VGAT:
1.02  0.02-fold (3-month-old; p  0.25)
and 1.05  0.03-fold (24 months old; p 

increased in patch areas (hatched lines) over areas outside the patches, both VGlut1 and VGAT immunoreactivity appeared
unchanged inside or outside the C1q-positive patches. G, H, Quantification of antibody-immunoreactivity confirmed that C1q￾immunoreactivity was increased in C1q-positive patches, compared with outside-patch signal intensities (3-month-old, p

patches are not amyloid plaques but represent a novel structure of
unknown significance and function.
C1q immunoreactivity in microglia and a subset of
inhibitory neurons
We next investigated the exact cellular localization of C1q
immunoreactivity in the adult brain. We detected C1q￾immunoreactivity at all developmental stages inside most or all
microglia (Figs. 4, 5C,D; see Fig. 6A), correlating with their well
described expression of C1q mRNA (Schmid et al., 2009). Al￾though C1q immunoreactivity was virtually exclusively detected
in microglia throughout the early postnatal brain (Fig. 4A,B), in
the adult and aged mouse brain it was detected at increased levels
in all microglia as well as throughout the neuropil (Figs. 4C,D,
5C,D). In addition, from early adulthood on, strong C1q immu￾noreactivity was present in a distinct population of larger cells,
exclusively detected in the hippocampus, thalamus, midbrain
and striatum (Fig. 5A,B, as a representative overview). These cells
represented a subset of neurons as confirmed by confocal micros￾copy colocalization analysis with the neuronal nuclear marker
NeuN (Fig. 5E). Furthermore, all C1q-positive neurons were in￾hibitory neurons as identified by colocalization with GABA im￾munoreactivity (Fig. 5F,G, hippocampus shown as representative
example). Although 100 percent of all C1q-positive neurons in
the hippocampus were GABAergic, only 40.3  1.8 percent (3-
month-old) and 37.3  2.3 per cent (24 months old) of GABAe￾rgic neurons were C1q-positive (Fig. 5H; n  3 animals/age),
confirming that they represent a subset of inhibitory neurons in
the adult mouse brain. Thus, both microglial cells and a subset of
inhibitory neurons exhibit strong C1q immunoreactivity; how￾ever, after early adulthood the degree of this immunoreactivity
did not increase with aging.
C1q immunoreactivity accumulates with aging in close
proximity to synapses
With aging, C1q immunoreactivity was particularly strong in
distinct hippocampal synaptic layers, in particular the dentate
gyrus ML and the stratum lacunosum moleculare of both the
mouse (Fig. 6A,B) and the human hippocampus (Fig. 6L,M).
When normalizing to C1q IHC signal levels in the mouse ML
of P6 brain slices, we found that C1q immunoreactivity in￾creased dramatically in the dentate gyrus molecular layer of
the aging mouse to 20-fold at 2 years of age [Fig. 6C; nor￾malized to P6 levels: P30: 8.60  0.54-fold increase, p  0.001
(P30 vs P6); 24 months: 20.29  0.52-fold increase, p  0.0001
(22 months vs P30); n  3 brains per age]. A similar aging￾dependent increase of C1q-immunoreactivity was detected in
the ML of aged human donors to approximately eightfold of
infant levels (Fig. 6N; normalized to 1-month-old donor lev￾els, 2 months old: 1.05  0.04, p  0.79 (2 vs 1 month); 75

Figure 6. C1q immunoreactivity dramatically increases with age in hippocampal synaptic layers and at synapses. A, B, Immunohistochemistry analysis confirmed comparably low levels of C1q
immunoreactivity (arrows) in the hippocampus of P6 mice (A) but dramatically increased levels in all synaptic layers of the 24-month-old murine hippocampus (B): stratum oriens (SO), stratum
radiatum (SR), stratum lacunosum moleculare (SLM), dentate gyrus ML. Very strong C1q immunoreactivity was also detected in the neuropil surrounding the CA2 cell bodies (arrowhead). C,
Quantification of C1q immunoreactivity in the ML from early postnatal to old aged mice confirmed that C1q immunoreactivity dramatically increases with aging in the murine ML. C1q signals,
normalized to P6 levels (n  3 brains per age; statistical significance: P30 vs P6:p  0.001; 22 months vs P30:p  0.0001). D,E, Anti-C1q immunohistochemistry signals (rabbit anti-mouse C1q
monoclonal antibody) visualized by confocalmicroscopy werespecific. C1q immunoreactivity was only detected inthe adult wild-type dentate gyrusmolecular layer(D) but not inthe corresponding
tissue from C1q-deficient littermate mice (E). F, High resolution confocal microscopy revealed that C1q immunoreactivity in the ML was detected in close proximity to synaptic terminals
(synaptophysin immunoreactivity, arrows). G, Subcellular fractionation of murine hippocampus homogenate revealed that C1q (detected with a polyclonal anti-C1q antibody) was enriched in the
crudesynaptosomalfractions(P2)from both adult and agedmice,similartothesynaptic protein PSD95, comparedwiththesupernatantfraction(S2;representative images;GAPDH loading control).
H, Quantification of the hippocampal subcellular fractionation analysis confirmed that C1q was enriched in the crude synaptosomal fraction (P2) from both 3-month-old (p  0.0091) and
22-month-old(p0.0055)mice(n4 animals/age), compared withthe counter-fraction S2.I–K, Single-section cryo-immuno electronmicroscopy confirmedthat C1q immunoreactivity(12 nm
gold particles) was detected in close proximity to the extracellular side of presynaptic- (pseudo-colored in green) or postsynaptic- (pseudo-colored in brown) elements (red arrows) and associated
with unidentifiablestructures (red arrowheads). Thissingle-section image analysis did not allow clear identification of all elements visible in eachsection. It was therefore impossible to classify C1q
immunoreactivity associated with unidentified elements assynaptic or nonsynaptic. K, Dual-immunogold analysis in the dentate gyrus molecular layer of aged mice. C1q immunoreactivity (12 nm
gold particles, arrows) was detected in close proximity to both presynaptic (green) and postsynaptic (brown) elements. In contrast, synaptophysin immunoreactivity (6 nm gold particles, white
arrowheads) was detected inside clearly identifiable presynaptic terminals as well as associated with unidentifiable structures, likely reflecting presynaptic terminals.L, M, C1q immunoreactivity
dramatically increased with age in synaptic layers of the human hippocampus. L, C1q immunoreactivity in the human infant (2-month-old) was restricted to blood vessels (arrows), indicating

from available infant and old aged human donor tissue confirmed that C1q immunoreactivity dramatically increased with aging in the human ML. C1q signals, normalized to 1 month levels (n 

years old: 8.25  0.49, p  0.0001 (77 years vs 1 month); n 
4 slices per donor).
As the most prominent increase in C1q immunoreactivity
during aging occurred in the CNS neuropil and in particular
the ML, we next investigated whether C1q was localized to ML
synapses. Using confocal microscopy we found that the C1q
signals were closely associated with the synaptic protein syn￾aptophysin (Fig. 6D–F). In addition, performing biochemical
fractionation of hippocampus homogenates from both adult
and old aged mice, C1q was enriched in the crude synapto￾somal fraction (P2) that is enriched in synaptic structures,
when compared with the counter fraction (S2) mostly de￾pleted of synaptic structures as indicated by PSD95 immuno￾reactivity [Fig. 6G,H; P2/S2 C1q signal quantification, 3
months of age: 6.34  1.12-fold increase ( p  0.0091); 22
months of age: 5.42  0.81-fold increase ( p  0.0055); n  4
animals/age]. Consistent with these findings, using cryo￾immuno electron microscopy, we found that C1q protein was
localized to and near to the surfaces of presynaptic and post￾synaptic structures (Fig. 6I–K) in the adult and aging brain.
The single-section analysis performed did not allow 3-D re￾construction of tissue samples, and thus quantification of
synaptic versus nonsynaptic C1q levels. However, anti-C1q
immunoreactivity was frequently detected in close proximity
to pre-or postsynaptic elements (Fig. 6I–K, red arrows), in
addition to association with unidentifiable structures (Fig.
6I–K, red arrowheads). This was comparable to the signal dis￾tribution of anti-synaptophysin immunoreactivity, which was
detected in clearly identifiable presynaptic terminals and as￾sociated with undefinable structures, presumably presynaptic
elements (Fig. 6K, white arrowheads). Together, biochemical
and immunohistochemistry techniques confirm that the ma￾jority of C1q protein detected in the neuropil is associated
with synaptic elements in the adult and aging brain, and thus
that the age-dependent increase of C1q protein in the brain
mainly occurs in close proximity to synapses.
The increase of C1q-levels with CNS maturation and aging
causes reorganizations of the circuitry independent of
synapse elimination
The synaptic localization and dramatic increase of C1q with ag￾ing, along with its particularly prominent localization in the ML
of the hippocampus, raised the question of whether the age de￾pendent increase in C1q affected synapse number. We therefore
quantified excitatory postsynaptic element numbers in the outer
ML of Golgi-stained tissue. However, dendritic spine numbers
were unaltered between aged C1q-deficient mice and their wild￾type littermates (Fig. 7A,B; 18-month-old, wild-type: 2.37 
0.15 spines/m; C1q-deficient littermates: 2.18  0.20 spines/
m; p  0.47; n  4 animals/genotype), arguing against a corre￾lation of increased C1q levels with synapse elimination in normal
CNS aging.
We further examined basal synaptic transmission in the ML
(Fig. 7C), measured as the input/output relationship between
activation (amplitude of the presynaptic compound action po￾tential, fiber volley) and the fEPSP I/O curve. Neither juvenile,
adult, nor aged C1q-deficient mice displayed a significant change
in this I/O curve (Fig. 7D; P14 –P17, p  0.896; n  6 wild-type,
n  6 C1q-deficient littermates; Fig. 7E; 3-month-old, p  0.284;
n  10 wild-type, n  12 C1q-deficient littermates; Fig.7F; 17-
month-old, p  0.494; n  13 wild-type, n  11 C1q-deficient
littermates), suggesting that C1q deficiency does not result in a
significant change in the ratio of presynaptic axons to synapses at
any age in the dentate ML. Interestingly, we found that the rela￾tionship between the applied stimulus and the fiber volley was
significantly suppressed in adult and aged (Fig. 7H,I; p  0.05,
p  0.0486, respectively) but not in juvenile C1q-deficient mice
(Fig. 7G; p  0.86), compared with their wild-type littermates.
This indicates that either the number of presynaptic axons or
their excitability is decreased in the ML of aging C1q-deficient
mice. Together, these physiology results suggest that if anything,
the presence of C1q enhances synapse number with aging, but
certainly does not decrease it. The relationship between the ap￾plied stimulus and the resulting fEPSPs (data not shown) was not
significantly different between C1q-genotypes at any age, rein￾forcing the idea that C1q does not reduce the overall number of
synapses in the ML of the dentate gyrus. Thus, these findings
identify a novel function for C1q in impacting circuit diversity
with aging that is independent of classical complement-mediated
synapse pruning.
To investigate whether the dramatic increase of C1q at aging
synapses impacts synaptic plasticity, we analyzed activity￾dependent synaptic potentiation of perforant path to dentate
gyrus synapses (Fig. 7C) in C1q-deficient mice compared with
their wild-type littermates. Interestingly, adult C1q-deficient
mice showed enhancements in both post-tetanic potentiation
[PTP; Fig. 8B; 3-month-old, PTP, wild-type: 164.6  3.5; C1q￾deficient: 200.8.1  7.1 fEPSP (% baseline), p  0.008] and sub￾sequent potentiation when compared with their wild-type
littermates [Fig. 8B, potentiation after PTP decay, 5–10 min after
tetanus, wild-type: 119.5  0.7; C1q-deficient: 144.9  0.6 fEPSP
(% baseline), p  0.049; potentiation was significantly different
for the time-span from 3 to 20 min post-tetanus, p  0.049].
Potentiation also decayed faster in adult C1q-deficient mice (p 
0.001); however, at 1 h post-tetanus, potentiation in C1q￾deficient and wild-type littermates had decayed to similar values
(wild-type 110.2  0.8 and C1q-deficient 116.0  0.6, p  0.634).
In contrast, no differences between C1q-deficient and wild-type
littermates were detected in juvenile mice (Fig. 8A, P14 –P17) or
aged mice (Fig. 8C, 17-month-old) as synaptic potentiation after
tetanic stimulation, both immediately after tetanic stimulation
(PTP juvenile: p  0.554; PTP aged: p  0.671) and later poten￾tiation (juvenile: p  0.867; aged: p  0.205) were nearly identical
between C1q-deficient and wild-type littermates mice. In accor￾dance with the substantial age-dependent increase of C1q protein
already in the maturing ML, this indicates that C1q exerts a neg￾ative effect on synaptic plasticity in the adult but not juvenile or
old aged ML. Paired-pulse facilitation analysis did not reveal any
differences between C1q-deficient mice and their wild-type lit￾termates, suggesting that the potentiation phenotype in adult
mice is not driven by altered presynaptic facilitation (data not
shown). As neither juvenile C1q-deficient mice (Fig. 8A) nor
adult C3-deficient mice (Fig. 8D) have increased potentiation
after tetanic stimulation, the enhanced potentiation in adult
C1q-deficient mice reflects a novel synaptic function of C1q, in￾dependent of complement-cascade activity. Interestingly, adult
C3-deficient mice showed an inverse LTP-phenotype to adult
C1q-deficient mice, as potentiation in C3-deficient mice was sig￾nificantly reduced for the entire post-tetanus time-span when
compared with their wild-type littermates (Fig. 8D, p  0.044).
These data suggest that C1q and C3 also have individual func￾tions in the CNS beyond classical complement activation. To￾gether, these findings identify novel functions for C1q and C3 by
independently affecting LTP in the dentate gyrus, in particular
for C1q in negatively modulating synaptic plasticity of the adult

and impacting circuit diversity with aging that is independent of
classical complement-activity.
The dramatic increase of C1q in the aging CNS contributes to
age-dependent cognitive decline in otherwise healthy subjects
We next investigated whether the accumulation of C1q in the
aging brain and its effect on neuronal circuit plasticity in the
aging hippocampus functionally contributes to age-dependent
cognitive decline. We therefore ran a battery of mouse behavioral
tests, known to assess learning and memory functions that in￾volve hippocampal function (Steele and Morris, 1999; Tsetsenis
et al., 2011; Mustroph et al., 2012; S. Beraki, L. To, N. L. Saw, M.
Priestley, and M. Shamloo, unpublished observations), compar￾ing C1q-deficent mice to their wild-type littermates at 3- and
17-months of age. By comparing the behavioral performance of
each age group to a cohort of 3-month-old strain-matched refer￾ence mice (3-month-old control) that performed the behavioral
tasks identical to 3-month-old C1q wild-type mice (Fig. 9), we
were able to assess whether age-dependent cognitive decline oc￾curred in the aged mice tested and whether it was rescued by
C1q-deficiency. Interestingly, we did not observe differences be￾tween the genotypes at 3 months of age in any of the behavioral
tasks analyzed (Fig. 9A–C and data not shown). In addition, all of
our aged mice were able to learn the standard MWM similar to
the 3-month-old control mice (Fig. 9A	). Learning of the hidden
platform location (days 1–7) was mostly identical between 17-

and 3-month-old control mice. Only on day 7, the 3-month-old
controls performed significantly better than the aged C1q wild￾type mice (3-month-old control: 90.29  8.996 s; C1q wild-type:
145.8  15.19 s, p  0.01). However, no significant difference in
learning was detected between 3-month-old and aged C1q￾deficient mice (126.2  13.48 s, p  0.05). In strong contrast, a
reversal learning paradigm of the MWM that is used to assess
cognitive flexibility revealed signs of cognitive decline in 17-
month-old wild-type littermate mice. Strikingly, old aged C1q￾deficient mice performed here similar to the 3-month-old
controls, indicating that C1q-deficiency protects from age￾related decline in cognitive flexibility (Fig. 9A	). On the first day
of the reversal learning task (day 8), 3-month-old control mice
found the new location of the hidden platform faster than both
aged C1q-deficient and C1q wild-type littermate mice (C1q wild￾type: 181.0  9.982 s; C1q-deficient: 175.2  9.095 s; 3-month￾old control: 129.6  13.94 s; C1q wild-type versus 3-month-old
control: p  0.05; C1q-deficient versus 3-month-old control: p 
0.05). However, aged C1q-deficient mice performed at the two
subsequent reversal learning days as fast as
the young controls (day 9: C1q-deficient:
120.8  11.69 s; 3-month-old control:
115.8  13.11, p  0.05; day 10: C1q-de￾ficient: 115.2  11.49; 3-month-old con￾trol: 102.7  15.7, p  0.05). This was in
strong contrast to the aged C1q wild-type
mice which showed reduced reversal
learning at both days, consistent with an
age-related decline in cognitive flexibility
(day 9: C1q wild-type: 171.5  12.13; C1q
wild-type vs C1q-deficient: p  0.05; C1q
wild-type vs 3-month-old control: p 
0.05; day 10: C1q wild-type: 153.0  12.91
s; C1q wild-type vs C1q-deficient: p 
0.05; C1q wild-type vs 3-month-old con￾trol: p  0.05). This indicates that C1q￾deficiency significantly protects from
age-related decline in cognitive flexibility.
There were no significant differences be￾tween the cohorts at all ages during visible
platform learning (day 11), indicating
that all animals were able to see. In addi￾tion, C1q-deficiency also protected from
age-dependent decline in spatial working
memory as assessed by Y-maze analysis.
The degree of cognitive-aging is subject￾specific and, accordingly, only approxi￾mately half of the aged wild-type
littermate mice assessed successfully per￾formed spontaneous alternations in the
Y-maze task above chance levels. The
other half of aged wild-type littermates,
however, revealed age-related decrease in
spatial working memory (Fig. 9B, circled
subjects), reducing total wild-type litter￾mate group performance to chance levels
(56.7  3.91%, p  0.1158). In strong
contrast, all 17-month-old C1q-deficient
mice performed spontaneous alternations
in the Y-maze task above chance level and
total group performance was significantly
above chance (Fig. 9B; 64.6  2.83%; p 
0.0009), comparable with the 3-month￾old controls (Fig. 9B; 61.72  3.39%; p  0.0072) and 3-month￾old C1q wild-type and C1q-deficient littermate mice (Fig. 9B;
C1q wild-type: 62.3  2.6%, p  0.0004; C1q-deficient: 61.8 
3.5%, p  0.0059). This increased performance in aged C1q￾deficient mice was not due to altered activity levels as open field
analysis confirmed that C1q-deficient mice have activity levels
identical to their C1q wild-type littermates at both 3and 17
months of age (Fig. 9C). As to be expected, the 3-month-old
control mice traveled slightly longer distance than the old￾aged mice (significant difference between aged mice and the
3-month-old controls at 5 min, p  0.05 and 7 min, p  0.01;
no significant difference at all other time points; p  0.05). In
addition, we did not observe any differences in health, motor
function, activity levels, exploratory behavior, or visual abili￾ties, nor did we detect significant differences in anxiety levels
at any age (data not shown). Finally, C1q-deficient mice did
not show any differences at any age in associative learning
compared with their wild-type littermates (data not shown).

These findings show that C1q-deficiency selectively improves
distinct cognitive functions particularly in old age.
Discussion
In summary, we have found that C1q levels dramatically increase
in close proximity to synapses in the aging brain where it plays a
novel role in contributing to aging-dependent cognitive decline.
To our knowledge, no protein has ever been demonstrated to
increase nearly so dramatically in concert with aging and to ac￾cumulate to such a high level in the aging brain. Interestingly,
C1q mRNA was previously shown to increase by several-folds in
many different mouse tissues with aging, including brain (Zahn
et al., 2006; Reichwald et al., 2009; Naito et al., 2012). Our finding
that C1q protein levels increased up to 300-fold suggests that the
increase with aging is likely due to accumulation of C1q protein
released by microglia and inhibitory neurons onto perisynaptic
sites. Although our novel finding of C1q protein in a subset of
inhibitory neurons in distinct regions of the murine CNS allows
for intriguing speculations, we have currently no experimental
evidence for functional explanations. However, Simonetti et al.
(2013) recently reported that activity-dependent calcium signal￾ing induces the expression of C1q in several neuronal types. Thus,
network activity in the mature murine CNS, and in particular
specific calcium signaling events in a subset of inhibitory neu￾rons, may drive strong C1q expression which we were able to
detect with our novel anti-C1q antibody.

(p  0.05). On the first day of the reversal learning task (day 8), 3-month-old controls found the new location of the hidden platform faster than both aged KO and WT mice (WT vs 3-month-old
control:p0.05; KO vs 3-month-old control:p0.05). However, aged KO mice performed at the twosubsequent reversal learning days as fast as the 3-month-old controls (day 9:p0.05; day
10:p0.05). This was instrong contrast to the aged WT mice whichshowed reduced reversal learning at both days, consistent with an age-related decline in cognitive flexibility (day 9: WT vs KO:
p0.05; WT vs 3-month-old control:p0.05; day 10: WT vs KO:p0.05; WT vs Bio Ctrl:p0.05). There were nosignificant differences between the cohorts at all ages during visible platform
learning (day 11), indicating that all animals were able to see. B, Y-maze analysis revealed intact spatial working memory in aged KO mice. KO mice performed spontaneous alternations in the
Y-maze task at all ages significantly above chance (50%) and equally well as the 3-month-old controls (KO: 3 months of age,p  0.0059; corresponding 3-month-old control,p  0.0188; KO: 17
months of age,p  0.0009; corresponding 3-month-old control,p  0.0072). In contrast, although young adult WT mice were able to learn the task (p  0.0004), a large proportion of aged WT
mice did not perform above chance levels (circled subjects), particularly indicating the subjects with age-related decrease in spatial working memory (17-month-old WT, whole group mean:p 
0.1158).C, Open field analysis confirmedthat KOmice have activity levels identicaltotheWT at both 3(adult) and 17months(aged) of age. Asto be expected,the 3-month-old controlmicetraveled
slightly longer distance than the aged KO and WT mice (significant difference between C1qWT/KO and the 3-month-old controls at 5 min:p  0.05, and 7 min:p  0.01; no significant difference
at all other time points (p0.05)). Three-month-old:n13WT,n13 KO littermates; 17-month-old:n11WT,n9 KO littermates; 3-month-old control:n10; *p0.05, **p0.01,

and humans was the hippocampal dentate gyrus, a region long
implicated in age-dependent synaptic changes and cognitive de￾cline in otherwise healthy aged rodents and primates, including
humans (Burke and Barnes, 2006; Yankner et al., 2008; Morrison
and Baxter, 2012). We were indeed able to show with several
behavioral tests that involve hippocampus-dependent function
(Steele and Morris, 1999; Tsetsenis et al., 2011; Mustroph et al.,
2012; S. Beraki, L. To, N. L. Saw, M. Priestley, and M. Shamloo,
unpublished observations) that C1q-deficiency selectively
protects from aging-related cognitive decline. Thus, the age￾dependent increase of C1q in the CNS correlates with and con￾tributes to the progression of cognitive aging. Interestingly,
despite the substantial increase of C1q protein during CNS mat￾uration and an impact of C1q on dentate gyrus-dependent syn￾aptic plasticity in the adult, we did not detect differences between
3-month-old C1q-deficient mice and their wild-type littermates
in any of the behavioral tasks performed. This suggests that either
only extended C1q accumulation at CNS synapses or the molecular
environment in the old aged CNS, together with C1q accumulation,
impacts behavioral outcome. Alternatively, our behavioral tasks, op￾timized to reveal age-dependent cognitive decline,were not suited to
detect an impact of C1q on cognition in younger adults. In this
regard, our littermate analysis is particularly important, as subtle
genetic and environmental differences may have a severe impact on
behavioral comparability.
Our data revealed a complex impact of C1q onto synaptic
plasticity and the neuronal circuitry in the adult and aging ML,
which is independent of the classical complement cascade and
not mediated by synapse elimination (Stevens et al., 2007). In￾deed, whereas aging-related cognitive decline is known to coin￾cide with synapse loss in the dentate gyrus of otherwise healthy
humans and rats (Yankner et al., 2008; Morrison and Baxter,
2012), this aging-dependent synapse loss does not occur in mice
(Calhoun et al., 1998). In concordance with our findings, C1q
was recently shown to also have noncomplement cascade￾dependent modes of action (Benoit and Tenner, 2011; Naito et
al., 2012; Nayak et al., 2012; Benoit et al., 2013), and novel roles in
synaptic plasticity that are presumably cascade independent have
recently been reported for several C1q-like molecules (Matsuda
et al., 2010; Uemura et al., 2010; Bolliger et al., 2011). Interest￾ingly, Naito et al. (2012) discovered that C1q promotes aging￾associated decline in tissue regeneration in the periphery and that
this effect was independent of complement cascade execution but
through canonical Wnt signaling. However, whereas C1q aug￾mented Wnt signaling in a variety of tissues, this was not the case
for the murine brain (Naito et al., 2012). As such, this suggests
that C1q is likely acting via pathways alternative to Wnt for the
phenotypes described in the work presented here. Given that we
have studied a systemic knock-out of C1q we cannot fully exclude
the possibility of a peripheral contribution to the CNS pheno￾types described in this study. However, based on our and other
labs previously published results that microglia in particular pro￾duce C1q protein in the CNS, and our intriguing finding that C1q
protein dramatically increases with aging in close proximity to
CNS synapses, it is likely that CNS-derived C1q is the source for
the physiological changes we have studied and confirmed with
this systemic C1q knock-out in otherwise healthy aging mice.
Also, as our physiological data confirms that there are no func￾tional abnormalities in the developing C1q knock-out hip￾pocampus; this suggests that the outlined aging-related changes
in the hippocampus were not due to altered developmental pro￾cesses. Important questions for future research, which will be
aided by a not yet available conditional C1q knock-out mouse
model, will therefore be to understand how C1q impacts the adult
and aging circuitry, why C1q accumulates in close proximity to
aging synapses, and whether this reflects their senescence.
Finally, our findings have important implications for under￾standing and treating cognitive decline in the aging CNS and for
understanding neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s
disease. Will drugs that prevent an increase in C1q, or that block
its function, lessen cognitive decline, and/or restore cognitive
function in normal aging? In addition, it has long been mysteri￾ous why the aging CNS has dramatically enhanced vulnerability
to neurodegeneration. Our finding that C1q exponentially accu￾mulates at aging synapses may be the missing link as it suggests
that these aging synapses are highly vulnerable to any insults that
would activate the complement cascade within the CNS. Such
insults include CNS ischemia or trauma, systemic bacterial infec￾tions, as well as -amyloid accumulation, which all powerfully
activate the complement cascade. Reactive astrocytes triggered by
all of these conditions strongly upregulate multiple complement
components (Veerhuis et al., 2011; Zamanian et al., 2012). In
addition, blood– brain barrier breakdown would allow all serum￾borne complement components to flood into the brain, trigger￾ing synaptic complement cascade activation, and thus synapse
elimination by microglial engulfment (Schafer et al., 2012). Syn￾apse loss is one of the hallmarks of virtually all neurodegenerative
diseases (Stephan et al., 2012), by blocking the complement cas￾cade or interfering with the localization of C1q to synapses, it may
be possible to prevent this massive synapse loss that drives neu￾rodegeneration in the aging CNS.
