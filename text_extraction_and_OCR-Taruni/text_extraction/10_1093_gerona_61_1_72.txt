Background. Although muscle strength and mass are highly correlated, the relationship between direct measures of
low muscle mass (sarcopenia) and strength in association with mortality has not been examined.
Methods. Total mortality rates were examined in the Health, Aging and Body Composition (Health ABC) Study in
2292 participants (aged 70–79 years, 51.6% women, and 38.8% black). Knee extension strength was measured with
isokinetic dynamometry, grip strength with isometric dynamometry. Thigh muscle area was measured by computed
tomography (CT) scan, and leg and arm lean soft tissue mass were determined by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry
(DXA). Both strength and muscle size were assessed as in gender-specific Cox proportional hazards models, with age,
race, comorbidities, smoking status, level of physical activity, fat area by CT or fat mass by DXA, height, and markers
of inflammation, including interleukin-6, C-reactive protein, and tumor necrosis factor-a considered as potential
confounders.
Results. There were 286 deaths over an average of 4.9 (standard deviation ¼ 0.9) years of follow-up. Both quadriceps
and grip strength were strongly related to mortality. For quadriceps strength (per standard deviation of 38 Nm), the crude
hazard ratio for men was 1.51 (95% confidence interval, 1.28–1.79) and 1.65 (95% confidence interval, 1.19–2.30) for
women. Muscle size, determined by either CT area or DXA regional lean mass, was not strongly related to mortality. In
the models of quadriceps strength and mortality, adjustment for muscle area or regional lean mass only slightly attenuated
the associations. Further adjustment for other factors also had minimal effect on the association of quadriceps strength
with mortality. Associations of grip strength with mortality were similar.
Conclusion. Low muscle mass did not explain the strong association of strength with mortality, demonstrating that
muscle strength as a marker of muscle quality is more important than quantity in estimating mortality risk. Grip strength
provided risk estimates similar to those of quadriceps strength.
OLDER adults with reduced muscle strength have
higher mortality (1–6). Muscle strength is closely re￾lated to the absolute quantity of muscle mass, which is also
reduced with aging (7–10). This decrease in muscle mass
(sarcopenia) is thought to contribute to the development of
functional limitations and disability in old age (11,12), and
potentially might explain part of the association between
strength and mortality. Previous studies (1–4) have used
only weight, creatinine excretion, or derived anthropometric
measures to estimate muscle mass. Thus the role of muscle
mass in mediating the strength–mortality association has not
been adequately determined.
Strength might also predict mortality because it is reduced
with disease and deconditioning. For example, lower ex￾tremity arterial ischemia can cause lower muscle strength
and function (13). Pain from osteoarthritis may prevent ac￾tivity resulting in atrophy from disuse. Intervention studies
show the potential for large improvements in strength with
small increases in lean mass (14), illustrating the importance
of activity and exercise. Markers of inflammation are also
related to lower strength (15) and lean mass, as well as to
a decline in strength (16). However, in the Women’s Health
and Aging Study, comorbidity and inflammatory markers
did not explain the association of lower grip strength with
mortality (3).
The Health, Aging and Body Composition (Health ABC)
Study was designed to determine the role of body com￾position changes in the risk of poor health outcomes
including death and functional limitation in older adults. In
this report, we sought to determine whether low muscle
mass, measured with computed tomography (CT) scanning
and dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), would ex￾72

plain an association of strength with mortality with and
without adjusting for hypothesized causes of sarcopenia,
including physical activity, disease, and inflammatory
markers. Finally, we were able to compare associations on
the basis of isokinetic quadriceps strength versus isometric
grip strength.
METHODS
Population
The Health ABC Study cohort included 3075 men
(48.4%) and women (51.6%) aged 70–79 years, of whom
41.6% are African American. Recruitment and eligibility
have been described (7). Briefly, participants were sampled
and recruited from Medicare listings in Pittsburgh, Penn￾sylvania, and Memphis, Tennessee. Eligibility criteria in￾cluded: age 70–79 years, self-report of no difficulty walking
one-quarter mile or climbing 10 steps, or with activities of
daily living, no history of active treatment for cancer in the
prior 3 years, and no plan to move out of the area. All
participants gave informed consent, and the consent forms
and protocol were approved by the institutional review
boards at each field center. For the present analysis, only
those persons with complete data for strength and body
composition were included (n ¼ 2292).
Outcome
Total mortality was assessed over 6 years with a mean
follow-up of 4.9 (standard deviation [SD] 0.9) years. Sur￾veillance was conducted by in-person examination or tele￾phone interview every 6 months. Hospital records, death
certificates, informant interviews, and autopsy data were
reviewed by committee to adjudicate immediate and under￾lying causes of death. The number of individual causes of
death was too low to have adequate power to assess risk for
cause-specific mortality at this time.
Strength Assessments
Strength was measured using an isokinetic Kin-Com
dynamometer (model 125 AP; Chattanooga, TN) for knee
extension and an isometric dynamometer (Jaymar, Boling￾brook, IL) for grip strength. For knee extension, the right leg
was used unless contraindicated by pain or history of joint
replacement. Participants with uncontrolled hypertension,
stroke, bilateral knee replacement, or severe bilateral knee
pain were excluded from the test (7). Isometric grip strength
was assessed for each hand. Participants with severe hand
pain or recent surgery were excluded. The vast majority
(96%) who had leg strength testing also had grip strength
testing. For these analyses, we used the maximum of the
force from two trials for the right upper extremity. The ratio
of muscle size to strength (specific torque or force) (7) was
calculated as a marker of the quality of the muscle and was
also considered as a predictor of mortality (7,17).
Body Composition
Lean mass of the upper and lower extremities as well as
the total body were assessed using DXA (Hologic QDR
4500, software version 8.21; Waltham, MA). Bone mineral
content was subtracted from the total and regional lean mass
to define total nonbone lean mass, which represents
primarily skeletal muscle in the extremities (18). Fat mass
was estimated for the whole body as well. Both the percent
fat and total fat were examined in these analyses. With the
participant in a hospital gown and no shoes, body weight
and height were measured by calibrated balance beam scale
and stadiometer, respectively. Body mass index (BMI) in
kilograms per meter squared was also examined as a measure
of body composition. Analyses of the lower extremities
were repeated using cross-sectional muscle and fat areas of
the mid-thigh assessed by CT scan (in Pittsburgh: 9800
Advantage, General Electric, Milwaukee, WI; in Memphis:
Somatom Plus 4, Siemens, Erlangen, Germany, and PQ
2000S, Marconi Medical Systems, Cleveland, OH) (17). All
images were network transferred (Transmission Controlled
Protocol/Internet Protocol) and analyzed by a single ob￾server using a Sun workstation (SPARC station II; Sun
Microsystems, Mountain View, CA) and proprietary In￾teractive Data Language development software (RSI
Systems, Boulder, CO).
Other Covariates
Age, race, level of physical activity, total number of
chronic conditions, smoking status, and field site were all
considered as possible confounders of the association be￾tween strength and mortality. Physical activity was assessed
by self-report as total kilocalories/week spent walking and
exercising (19,20). Smoking status was assessed by ques￾tionnaire, and participants were classified as current, past, or
never smokers. Depression score, assessed with the Center
for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression (CES-D) scale (21),
was examined as a potential marker of motivation because
voluntary assessment of strength was used. Using self-report
with confirmation by treatment and medications, we as￾sessed comorbidity as the total number of 11 chronic health
conditions. These conditions included cancer, myocardial
infarction, congestive heart failure, depression, diabetes,
hypertension, knee osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, peripheral
arterial disease, pulmonary disease, and stomach and/or
duodenal ulcer. Inflammatory markers were assessed from
stored fasting blood specimens. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and
tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) were measured in duplicate
using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits (R&D
Systems, Minneapolis, MN). C-reactive protein serum levels
were also measured in duplicate using enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay based on purified protein and poly￾clonal anti-C-reactive protein antibodies (Calbiochem, San
Diego, CA) (22).
Analysis
Means and proportions were used to describe demo￾graphic and key clinical characteristics of the study popu￾lation. Because there was minimal overlap in strength or
body composition between men and women, all analyses
were stratified by gender. Quadriceps and grip strength were
examined as continuous variables. After assessing the
proportionality assumption, we used the Cox proportional
hazards model to assess the association between strength
and mortality. Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence

intervals (CI) are reported. Results were expressed in the full
cohort’s SD for each strength measure to allow a comparison
of the HR for quadriceps strength and for grip strength and
between men and women. Separate models were used to
first adjust for CT and then DXA body composition
measures. Additional potential factors were considered
using a forward stepwise procedure to adjust for age, race,
height, inflammatory markers, smoking status, comorbidity
count, level of physical activity, education, and depression
score. Alternative models adjusting for individual health
conditions were also examined, but did not change the main
findings. Models were also examined with adjustment for
BMI as an alternative to the more direct measures of lean
and fat mass.
RESULTS
Over the follow-up period, there were 286 deaths (180 in
men and 106 in women), with mortality rates of 33.1 and
18.1 per 1000 person-years, respectively. At baseline (Table
1), the mean age was 73.7 years in men and 73.4 years in
women. Strength and body composition of the cohort
differed substantially in men and women, with women
having substantially lower strength, lower lean mass and
muscle area, and higher subcutaneous fat area and fat mass.
Of note, the mean BMI was similar in men and women.
Both quadriceps and grip strength were strongly related to
mortality. For quadriceps strength (per SD of 38 Nm), the
crude HR was 1.51 (95% CI, 1.28–1.79) for men and 1.65
(95% CI, 1.19–2.30) for women (Table 2). In the models of
quadriceps strength and mortality, adjustment for muscle
area or regional lean mass only slightly attenuated the
associations. There was also little evidence that the
associations of quadriceps strength with mortality were
due to demographic, behavioral, or health factors considered
in the multivariate models. These factors only slightly
attenuated the association of strength with mortality in both
men and women. In the models adjusting for lean and fat
mass using DXA, the association of quadriceps strength
with mortality was reduced to a HR of 1.45 (95% CI, 1.21–
1.74) in men and 1.47 (95% CI, 1.02–2.14) in women.
When adjusting for lean and fat by CT scan, the attenuation
of the HR for strength was slightly greater in the men.
Regardless of whether DXA or CT was used, the other
factors that were associated with mortality were similar. In

men, these included age, smoking status, number of chronic
conditions, lower education, and higher IL-6; in women,
they included age, smoking status, low physical activity, IL￾6, and depression score. In men, height was associated with
higher mortality in the multivariable model adjusted for CT
measures but not in the model adjusting for DXA measures.
CT measures of intermuscular fat and muscle attenuation
were not related to mortality.
Unadjusted and adjusted associations of grip strength with
mortality were similar to those for quadriceps strength. When
considering an SD of grip strength (10.7 kg) to allow
a comparison to an SD of quadriceps strength, the HRs
were 1.36 (95% CI, 1.10–1.60) in men and 1.67 (95% CI, 1.08–
2.58) in women. Factors that accounted for part of the
association of grip strength with mortality and were signifi￾cantly associated with mortality were essentially the same as for
the models of leg strength and included age, smoking status,
number of chronic conditions, lower education, and higher IL-6
in men and age, smoking status, low physical activity, and IL-6
in women. Of note, total fat mass tended to be protective; this
was statistically significant in the men.
For both quadriceps and grip strength, the HRs for
mortality appeared to be a little higher in women than in
men. The CIs overlapped, and there was no evidence for
a significant interaction between gender and strength on
mortality. Adjustment for BMI yielded risk estimates similar
to those shown for adjustment for lean and fat mass by DXA
or for muscle and fat areas by CT scan.
Separate models for muscle size by DXA or CT scan were
examined to further evaluate the lack of attenuation of
strength by muscle size. In men, a lower leg muscle area on
CT scan was related to a higher risk of mortality (adjusted
HR ¼ 1.26; 95% CI, 1.02–1.55) (Table 3). This was not the
case in the women. Lean mass by DXA, either for the lower
or the upper extremity, was not related to mortality in men
or women. As would be expected from these results, the
risks for specific torque or force (Table 4) were similar to
those based on strength alone, showing adjusted relative
risks 25%–40% higher per SD in both men and women.
The mortality rate was approximately 25%–30% higher in
blacks than in whites. In men, there were 40.6 deaths per 1000
person-years in blacks (vs 29.1 in whites), and in women, 21.1
deaths in blacks (vs 15.9 in whites) per 1000 person-years.
However, the association of low strength with mortality was
similar in both groups, and tests for effect modification by race
within gender groups were not significant.
To illustrate the patterns of association between strength
and mortality, Kaplan–Meier survival curves were drawn for
intervals of both quadriceps (Figures 1 and 2) and grip strength
(Figures 3 and 4). The intervals of strength were chosen to
approximate a gender-specific SD of strength to provide stable
estimates of risk within gender. These figures show that the
relationship of strength to mortality could be seen across the
range of strength in this nondisabled cohort. There was no
statistical evidence of any threshold in the association of either
quadriceps strength or grip strength with mortality. Patterns of
association were quite similar for both grip strength and
quadriceps strength and in both men and women.

DISCUSSION
This study confirms that measures of lower muscle
strength, both quadriceps and grip, are strong and inde￾pendent predictors of mortality in older adults. This asso￾ciation cannot be attributed to sarcopenia, as neither measure
of muscle size attenuated the associations. In fact, lower
muscle area by CT scan was the only measure of sarcopenia
that was an independent predictor of mortality and this was
only seen in the men. The strength–mortality association was
not due to a higher level of inactivity or chronic illness in
those participants with poor strength. The magnitude of
association for both quadriceps and grip strength were
similar, though perhaps slightly higher in women compared
to men when using the same scale. These differences were
not statistically significant, but may reflect that an interval
strength on the same scale represents a larger relative in￾crease in strength in the women than in the men. Although
blacks had a higher mortality risk, the relative risk of mor￾tality in relationship to strength was the same as in whites.
In epidemiological studies, grip strength has been
assessed more widely than has leg strength and has been
shown to be less strongly associated with age itself than has
leg strength (7,8). Nevertheless, grip strength has been
shown to be a robust predictor of mortality, even when
measured in middle age (23). Grip strength is currently
much easier to measure, thus has greater potential than
would isokinetic dynamometry for incorporating into clinic
practice. However, most studies report HRs based on
cohort-specific lowest versus highest tertile or quartile of
grip strength, so the exact magnitude of risk is difficult to
evaluate across studies. Because there appears to be no
threshold in this relationship, it may be helpful to report risk
for standard intervals in future studies.
Previous studies have examined only men (1,2), or women
(3); most have examined only grip strength, and none has
adjusted for direct quantification of muscle area or lean mass as
measures of sarcopenia. Nevertheless, all of these studies show
consistent findings that suggest that muscle strength is a very
important marker of mortality risk in old age. This association
remains unexplained by sarcopenia, disease, activity level, and
inflammatory markers in this study and in the Women’s Health
and Aging Study (3). This might be due to inadequate
assessment of these factors, but more likely suggests that
muscle strength may capture important aspects of the aging
process that were not included in this analysis or in other
studies. Potentially, strength-related hormonal factors such as

leg strength groups (,90, 90–,130, 130–,170, 170 Nm). Intervals of 40 Nm

testosterone (24) and insulin-like growth factor-I (25,26), which
decline with age and strength, might explain why strength
appears to be such a powerful marker of risk. Assessment of
these factors is in progress in the Health ABC Study.
The loss of motor neurons with aging results in an
increase in size of remaining motor units, but with greater
preservation of type 1 fibers, resulting in preservation of
mass with relatively fewer type 2 fibers, thus lower strength
(27). This neurogenic aspect of muscle aging is difficult
to study without muscle biopsy, thus we are unable to
determine whether this would explain the associations of
strength but not mass with mortality.
The strengths of this study are the comparison of men and
women and both upper and lower extremity strength, the use
of state-of-the-art assessment of regional body composition,
and the large number of minorities. DXA lean mass may
overestimate lean mass in obese individuals because it
includes intermuscular fat as lean mass. The similarity in the
DXA and CT results suggests that this potential bias is not
a major factor in these associations. To our knowledge, this
is the first large epidemiologic study of African Americans.
Strength has been shown previously to predict mortality in
Caucasians (1), Hispanics, and Asians (2).
There are important characteristics of this study which
limit the generalization of these findings. First, the Health
ABC Study cohort was nondisabled at baseline. It is quite
possible that measures of lean mass may be more important
in individuals who are more disabled. Second, only 85% of
this cohort was eligible for the isokinetic strength test.
Analysis of these findings in the full cohort with grip
strength alone was virtually identical, thus the exclusions do
not appear to have biased the findings reported.
This study has important implications for clinical practice
and future research. First, it shows that muscle function can
be used to assess mortality risk without accounting for
muscle size, and validates the use of grip strength against
leg strength, which better isolates a specific muscle group
but is harder to measure. Second, it demonstrates clearly that
lower lean mass is not a predictor of mortality, thus cannot
explain the strength–mortality association. These results do
not explain why strength predicts mortality. More detailed
assessment of lifelong activity; subclinical diseases; perhaps
cognition, hormonal, or genetic factors; and of the primary
changes in muscle with age are needed.
