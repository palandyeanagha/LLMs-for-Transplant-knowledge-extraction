Abstract
Background: Difficulties in prediction and early identification of (acute kidney injury) AKI have hindered the ability to
develop preventive and therapeutic measures for this syndrome. We tested the hypothesis that a urine test measuring
insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 7 (IGFBP7) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-2 (TIMP-2), both inducers of
G1 cell cycle arrest, a key mechanism implicated in acute kidney injury (AKI), could predict AKI in cardiac surgery patients.
Methods: We studied 50 patients at high risk for AKI undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Serial
urine samples were analyzed for [TIMP-2]*[IGFBP7] concentrations. The primary outcome measure was AKI as defined by
international consensus criteria following surgery. Furthermore, we investigated whether urine [TIMP-2]*[IGFBP7] could
predict renal recovery from AKI prior to hospital discharge.
Results: 26 patients (52%) developed AKI. Diagnosis based on serum creatinine and/or oliguria did not occur until 1–3 days
after CPB. In contrast, urine concentration of [TIMP-2]*[IGFBP7] rose from a mean of 0.49 (SE 0.24) at baseline to 1.51 (SE
0.57) 4 h after CPB in patients who developed AKI. The maximum urinary [TIMP-2]*[IGFBP7] concentration achieved in the
first 24 hours following surgery (composite time point) demonstrated an area under the receiver-operating characteristic
curve of 0.84. Sensitivity was 0.92, and specificity was 0.81 for a cutoff value of 0.50. The decline in urinary [TIMP-2]*[IGFBP7]
values was the strongest predictor for renal recovery.
Conclusions: Urinary [TIMP-2]*[IGFBP7] serves as a sensitive and specific biomarker to predict AKI early after cardiac surgery
and to predict renal recovery.

Introduction
Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common and serious complica￾tion after cardiac surgery [1]. It may occur in over 40% of adults,
with 1–5% requiring renal replacement therapy (RRT) [2–4].
After cardiac surgery, small creatinine increases of 20–25% from
preoperative baseline are associated with adverse outcomes [3,5].
The mortality in cardiac surgery patients with a severe, RRT￾requiring AKI can be as high as 60% [3,4,6]. Although some
clinical tools and scores exist to predict and stratify AKI, we are
still lacking biomarkers to predict AKI and recovery from AKI
early enough for interventions to be likely effective. The incidence
and severity of AKI and patients outcome have not changed in
recent years [1,7,8].
Currently, diagnosing and staging of AKI are exclusively based
on elevations in serum creatinine and/or decreases in urine
output. Serum creatinine, however, is widely known to be
insensitive to acute changes in kidney function [9]. Serum
creatinine concentrations neither accurately reflect the glomerular
filtration rate nor do they point to the degree of tubular injury
[6,10]. Therefore, serum creatinine values are poorly qualified to
detect AKI in the early period after cardiac surgery [11]. The

same is true for postoperative oliguria, which can be influenced by
a myriad of factors including volume status and use of diuretics. At
the very least, several hours are needed to define oliguria. Several
attempts to treat AKI have failed, perhaps in part because
therapies were initiated too late in the presence of an already
established acute tubular necrosis (ATN) [12].
Therefore, identifying biomarkers to predict the development
and severity of AKI early after cardiac surgery has been an
important goal for over a decade. Several biomarkers including
interleukin (IL)-18 [13], neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin
(NGAL) [14], cystatin c [15], and kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM￾1) [16] have been studied. However, the area under the curve
(AUC) and therefore the suitability of these biomarkers to predict
AKI after cardiac surgery were fairly low (0.65 for KIM-1 [17],
0.67 for NGAL [17], and 0.71 for cystatin c [15]).
AKI affects different complex cellular and molecular pathways
involving inflammatory, interstitial, endothelial, and epithelial
cells. These mechanisms comprise immunity, inflammation,
apoptosis, and cell cycle pathways. A recent study showed that
renal tubular cells enter a period of G1 cell-cycle arrest after
inducing ischemia [18] or sepsis [19]. IGFBP7 and TIMP-2 are
both involved in G1 cell cycle arrest during the early phase of cell
injury [20–22]. The G1 cell cycle arrest may prevent the division
of cells with damaged DNA until the DNA damage is repaired
[21]. In the Sapphire study [23], it was demonstrated that the
AUC values to predict the development of AKI (AKIN stage 2 or
3) in critically ill patients within 12 hours were 0.76 for IGFBP7
and 0.79 for TIMP-2. Multiplication of the two markers ([TIMP￾2]*[IGFBP7]) resulted in an even higher AUC (0.80) and was
significantly superior to all previously described markers of AKI.
Moreover, [TIMP-2]*[IGFBP7] significantly improved risk pre￾diction when added to clinical scoring systems.
Therefore the aim of the current study was to test the hypothesis
that urinary [TIMP-2]*[IGFBP7] can predict AKI early after
cardiac surgery and that urinary [TIMP-2]*[IGFBP7] can
function as a prognostic marker in patients with established AKI
providing information about the likelihood of recovery.
Materials and Methods
Patients and methods
The study was approved by the institutional review board of the
University of Mu¨nster. We used the Standards for Reporting of
Diagnostic Accuracy (STARD) statement for planning and
conducting the study and preparing the manuscript [24]. We
screened all patients admitted to the University of Mu¨nster
Cardiac Surgery service for cardiac surgery with CPB between
June 2013 and September 2013 (Figure 1: CONSORT 2010 Flow
Diagram). Patients with a Cleveland Clinic Foundation Score [8]
of 6 or more were eligible for enrollment. All patients eligible for
enrollment were approached. Exclusion criteria included (1)
pregnancy; (2) post-renal transplantation; (3) immunosuppressive
therapy; and (4) patients receiving corticosteroid therapy with a
change in their dose within the past 2 weeks. Written informed
consent was obtained from all patients at the time of enrollment.
All patients were prospectively followed from enrollment. Urine
samples were collected at predetermined time points: on the day of
the surgery preoperatively (immediately post-anesthesia induc￾tion), 4 h, 12 h, and 24 h after coming off CPB. At the same time
points, creatinine concentrations in the urine were measured.
Serum creatinine levels were measured preoperatively, 4 h, 12 h,
24 h, 48 h, 72 h, and at the time of hospital discharge. All patients
received routine standard of care during the study period. ICU
and hospital discharge were conducted at the discretion of the
treating clinicians, not involved in the study and not aware of study
data. Cardiac function and volume status were ascertained by
clinical judgment combined with transthoracic echocardiography
(TTE). A TTE examination was performed routinely on all
patients on the day of surgery (2 to 4 h after admission to the ICU)
and on day 1 following surgery. Patients were considered to have
completed the study at the time of hospital discharge. Urine
samples were immediately centrifuged, urine supernatants were
frozen, stored at #270uC and thawed immediately prior to
analysis.
Preoperative patient characteristics, significant intraoperative
risk factors and peri- and postoperative complications were
recorded. All clinical decisions were made by the responsible
cardiac surgeon, cardiac anesthetist, and/or intensivist.
Study endpoints
AKI status was classified using the RIFLE [25] or AKIN criteria
[26] together as described in the recent KDIGO international
guideline [27] based on the serum creatinine (sCR) and urine
output (UO) available in the hospital record. The primary end
point was the development of AKI after cardiac surgery. The
reference value for serum creatinine was obtained as follows: if at
least five values were available the median of all values available
from six months to one day prior cardiac surgery was used.
Otherwise, the creatinine value determined one day before cardiac
surgery was used. Serum creatinine was measured daily during the
entire hospital stay. Urine output was recorded hourly during the
ICU stay and twice daily until hospital discharge. The secondary
end point was renal recovery from established AKI defined as a
serum creatinine value at hospital discharge equal to or lower than
the preoperative creatinine value. As per hospital standard of care,
all patients were discharged to a rehabilitation facility, meeting
predefined discharge criteria. Other end points included length of
ICU and hospital stays. Furthermore, we recorded variables
known to impact AKI risk: age, sex, CPB time, cross-clamp time,
hypertension, congestive heart failure, diabetes, peripheral vascu￾lar disease, previous cardiothoracic surgery, preoperative creati￾nine clearances estimated by both Cockcroft and Gault and
Modification of Diet in Renal Disease equations [28], serial
plasma and urine creatinine, and urea nitrogen.
Biomarkers
TIMP-2 and IGFBP7 were measured with the NephroCheckTM
Test (Astute Medical, San Diego, CA, USA). The NephroCheck
Test is a point-of-care test which was developed to simultaneously
measure urine [TIMP-2]*[IGFBP7], whereas [TIMP￾2]*[IGFBB7] indicates the multiplication of both biomarkers. To
measure both biomarker concentrations in the urine, 100 ml urine
is required and it takes 20 minutes at the bedside to get the result.
Urine NGAL, a previously described biomarker of AKI, was
measured with a commercially available assay (Dianova, Ham￾burg, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
Statistical analysis
For the primary analysis, that is the difference between the urine
[TIMP-2]*[IGFBP7] levels in patients with AKI or without AKI,
we applied a Mann-Whitney-U-test. Based on the published
results on [TIMP-2]*[IGFBP7] [23], we aimed to detect a
difference in 1 unit in [TIMP-2]*[IGFBP7] with a power of
90%. Assuming an effect size of 1, a sample size of 26 patients per
group is necessary. Power calculation was performed with nQuery
Advisor (Version 7).
The study population was described by absolute and relative
frequencies, mean and standard error, where appropriate. To test
Biomarkers of AKI following Cardiac Surgery
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 March 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 3 | e93460

for a difference in age between AKI and non-AKI patients a t-Test
was applied. All other continuous variables were tested using
Mann-Whitney-U-tests due to lacking normality. The association
between categorical variables and the two groups (AKI vs. non￾AKI) was tested with Chi-Squared-Tests and, in case of previous
heart surgery and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, with
Fisher’s Exact Test.
The analysis of [TIMP2]*[IGFBP7] time course data was
performed independently for each time point using Mann￾Whitney-U-Tests. In each group the difference between the
respective time point and the baseline, i.e., pre-CPB, was tested, as
well as the location difference between the group at each
individual time point.
For all tests p-values #0.05 were considered significant. No
adjustment for multiple testing was performed. Results were
considered exploratory. The presented findings may be used to
generate new hypotheses.
To analyze the predictive power of selected biomarkers receiver
operating characteristic curves (ROC) were calculated and the
area under the ROC curve (AUC) was determined. 95%
confidence intervals (CI) were reported. For selected thresholds
of [TIMP2]*[IGFBP7] sensitivities, specificities, positive predictive
values (PPV) and negative predictive values (NPV) were reported
for each time point and the first 24 h post-operatively combined
(composite time point). Descriptive statistics, statistical tests, and
ROC analyses were performed using SPSS 21 (IBM SPSS
Statistics for Windows, Version 21.0. Armonk, NY: IBM Corp.).
To evaluate the additional information [TIMP-2]*[IGFBP7]
gives for risk classification in comparison to a pure clinical model
we calculated the integrated discrimination improvement (IDI)
and the category-free net reclassification index (cfNRI) [29]. IDI
and cfNRI have been calculated using the package PredictABEL
[30] in R (R version 3.0.0, April 2013. R Foundation for Statistical
Computing, Vienna, Austria). P-values and 95%-confidence
intervals (CI) for IDI and cfNRI are provided by the function
reclassification and are determined using a z-transformation of the
statistics.
Results
Patient characteristics and study endpoints
We recruited 50 patients and analyzed 50 patients. Thus, 50
patients were included in the study. The clinical characteristics of
the 50 subjects are provided in Table 1.
Of the 50 study subjects, 26 (52%) developed postoperative AKI
(the primary study end point) as defined by the KDIGO criteria.
In nine patients, AKI was diagnosed first by increases in serum
creatinine while in the remaining 17 patients, urine output criteria
were met first (Table 2). In all patients, hypovolemia was excluded
by clinical assessment using echocardiography. The mean
preoperative serum creatinine for all patients was 1.32 mg/
100 ml (median = 1.20 mg/100 ml), consistent with a mean
preoperative Modification of Diet in Renal Disease-estimated
glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 50.4 ml/min per 1.73 m2

body surface area. Baseline serum creatinine (mg/100 ml; mean
(standard error)) was 1.2860.21 in the group that did not develop
AKI (n = 24), not significantly different from the AKI group
(1.3660.40, n = 26, p = 0.342). There was also no significant
difference in baseline eGFR values between the two groups
(p = 0.286; Table 1). The peak serum creatinine (mg/100 ml)
postoperatively was significantly higher in the AKI group than in
the group that did not develop AKI (1.3860.54 vs 1.0660.27,
respectively; p = 0.015).
There were significantly longer intensive care unit (ICU,
p = 0.001) and hospital stays (p = 0.001) in the AKI group
(Table 1). Finally, the AKI group had a higher APACHE score
on day 1 (p = 0.001) than those without AKI (Table 1).
Biochemical value of urinary [TIMP-2]*[IGFBP7] for early
diagnosis of AKI
In the 24 patients who never developed AKI, no significant
increase was noted in urinary [TIMP-2]*[IGFBP7] concentrations
at any time point after cardiopulmonary bypass compared to the
preoperative measurement (pre-CPB) (all p-values .0.05). By
contrast, those who subsequently developed AKI had a striking
rise in urinary [TIMP-2]*[IGFBP7] concentrations at all time
points compared to pre-CPB (all p-values #0.05; Figure 2A). The
pattern of urinary [TIMP-2]*[IGFBP7] excretion was character￾ized by a peak very early after the precipitating event followed by a
lesser but sustained increase over the entire duration of the study
(Figure 2A). These results remained unchanged when urinary
[TIMP-2]*[IGFBP7] concentration was normalized for urinary
creatinine excretion although the time-profile of the point
estimates for the [TIMP-2]*[IGFBP7] values shifted slightly
(Figure 2B). In the 26 patients who developed AKI, urinary
NGAL significantly increased at 4 h after CPB (p = 0.001)
followed by a rapid decrease back to baseline at 12 h after CPB
(Figure 2C).
Performance of urinary [TIMP-2]*[IGFBP7] for diagnosis of
AKI
A composite time point consisting of the maximum urinary
[TIMP-2]*[IGFBP7] concentration attained during the first 24 h
after CPB outperformed all individual time points (AUC: 0.90, CI:
0.79–1.00; Figure 3A). For urine [TIMP-2]*[IGFBP7], the area
under the ROC curve was 0.81 (CI: 0.68–0.93) at 4 h after CPB
(Figure 3B), whereas the area under the ROC curve for urine
NGAL was 0.68 (CI: 0.53–0.84). Table 3 lists the derived
sensitivities, specificities, and predictive values at different cutoff
concentrations. For urine [TIMP-2]*[IGFBP7], a cutoff of 0.3
yielded good sensitivity and specificity at 4 h after CPB.

Prediction of renal recovery from AKI with urinary [TIMP￾2]*[IGFBP7]
Next, we assessed the relationship between a decline in urinary
biomarker concentrations between 4 and 24 h after surgery and
renal recovery, defined as a serum creatinine value at hospital
discharge equal to or lower than that at baseline (Figure 4). For
[TIMP-2]*[IGFBP7], the area under the ROC curve for the
difference between the two values was 0.79 (CI: 0.65–0.92)
(Figure 4). The area under the ROC curve for the difference
between the two NGAL values was 0.48 (CI: 0.31–0.64).
Combination of NGAL with [TIMP-2]*[IGFBP7] did not
improve the area under the ROC curve (data not shown).
Additional information from biomarkers over clinical
variables
We also investigated whether [TIMP-2]*[IGFBP7] enhances
predictive ability over clinical variables. [TIMP-2]*[IGFBP7]
significantly improved risk prediction when added to a six￾parameter clinical model for the primary endpoint, using time to
event, IDI and cfNRI analyses (Table 4 and 5). All analyses
showed significant enhancement by the addition of [TIMP￾2]*[IGFBP7] with [TIMP-2]*[IGFBP7] remaining strongly asso￾ciated with AKI in all models.

Discussion
AKI remains a common and serious clinical problem that
greatly adds to morbidity and mortality in both surgical and
medical patients. The KDIGO clinical practice guideline for AKI
[27] recommends risk assessment for all critically ill patients,
acknowledging that risk assessment is difficult. Clinical measures,
such as increased serum creatinine or decreased urine output, are
not suitable for risk assessment because these changes often occur
late after organ injury. Even in the relatively homogenous setting
of cardiac surgery, there is a paucity of biomarkers to predict AKI.
Therefore, there is a great interest to identify biomarkers which

can accurately and reliably predict AKI as well as recovery from
AKI early after cardiac surgery.
To test such biomarkers, we focused on patients at high risk for
AKI. To identify these patients we used the Cleveland Clinic
Foundation Score [8]. This score includes different risk categories
(e.g. gender, emergency surgery, type of surgery) and has been
shown to correlate with dialysis-dependent AKI following cardiac
surgery [8]. An important feature of this study is that we also
included patients with preexisting chronic kidney disease (CKD),
because it has been shown that other biomarkers have limited
informative value in patients with CKD [31].
Recently, results from a multicenter study of discovery and
validation of two novel biomarkers of AKI, TIMP-2 and IGFBP7,
in critically ill patients were reported [23]. The biomarkers were
measured in the urine of critically ill patients after ICU admission,
and the primary end point of that study was moderate to severe
AKI (KDIGO stage 2 to 3) within 12 hours of sample collection.
Urine [TIMP-2]*[IGFBP7] showed a better performance in
predicting AKI compared to all previously described markers
[23]. Here, we demonstrate that [TIMP-2]*[IGFBP7] concentra￾tion in the urine of patients undergoing cardiac surgery has a high
sensitivity and specificity in predicting AKI after cardiac surgery.
The AUC of [TIMP-2]*[IGFBP7] was higher compared to the
AUC of NGAL. However, combining NGAL and [TIMP￾2]*[IGFBP7] did not increase the predictability of AKI (data not
shown). As there are currently no interventions to treat AKI, it
becomes even more important to identify patients at high risk for
AKI and to diagnose AKI as early as possible. Thereby, necessary
steps can be taken to prevent further worsening of already existing
damage, e.g. initiating the KDIGO bundle [27]. In contrast,
patients with [TIMP-2]*[IGFBP7] concentrations below 0.4 in the
postoperative period developed no AKI and had a briefer stay in
the ICU and hospital compared to patients with high concentra￾tions.
The recovery rate of renal function is low in critically ill patients
with AKI [32]. This fact emphasizes that incomplete renal
recovery is a common problem in patients surviving severe AKI
[33]. Failure to recover renal function has negative effects on
quality of life and health care costs [34]. Identification of patients
at high risk for failure to recover has important implications for
their long-term management, e.g. avoidance/minimization of
nephrotoxins, early referral to a nephrologist. Despite significant
advances in the epidemiology of AKI, the prediction of renal
recovery from AKI remains a major clinical challenge. Unfortu￾nately, no reliable method to predict renal recovery exists. Recent
studies discovered biomarkers predicting recovery from AKI, but
the prediction performance was limited [35,36]. In the present
study, we evaluated whether the course of [TIMP-2]*[IGFBP7]
concentration can predict renal recovery. We defined renal
recovery from AKI as a serum creatinine level at hospital
discharge equal to or lower than the baseline creatinine level. In
our study, the course of [TIMP-2]*[IGFBP7] concentrations
proved a high sensitivity and specificity for the prediction of renal
recovery from AKI after cardiac surgery. In contrast to [TIMP￾2]*[IGFBP7], urinary NGAL concentration failed to predict renal
recovery after cardiac surgery (Figure 4). Our data are in line with
another study that demonstrated that NGAL has only limited
ability to predict renal recovery [35]. However, a recently
published study showed that in critically ill patients a panel of
urine biomarkers can augment prediction of recovery after AKI
[36]. This study evaluated six markers representing three aspects
of the physiology of renal recovery: inflammatory, renal tubular

epithelial cell regeneration, and filtration and tubular reabsorption
markers.
Several molecules are known to be involved in the pathogenesis
of AKI [37,38]. IGFBP7 and TIMP-2 are both inducers of G1 cell
cycle arrest, a mechanism involved in the early phase of AKI
[20,22]. After stress, injury or cell damage, renal tubular cells enter
for a short period G1 cell-cycle arrest [19] until the damage has
been repaired [21]. Cell cycle arrest occurs early after a variety of
insults [22]. This may help explain the early increase of TIMP-2
and IGFBP7 in the urine of patients with AKI after CPB. The fact
that the rapid decrease of [TIMP-2]*[IGFBP7] predicts recovery
from AKI after cardiac surgery suggests that the duration of the
stress and injury to the kidney after cardiac surgery is an important
determinant of AKI severity and recovery. Consequently, early
detection and risk assessment could improve patient outcome by
means of early intervention and optimization of patient manage￾ment [27].
Urinary biomarkers are frequently normalized against urinary
creatinine to account for changes in urine flow rate. However, a
timed collection of urine samples appears equally important for an
accurate estimation of the excretion rate [39]. In our study, the
first indication of AKI was based on oliguria in two thirds of
patients. Normalization of [TIMP-2]*[IGFBP7] to urine creati￾nine concentration, however, did not change informative value.
Our study has several strengths. First, our cohort of patients was
heterogeneous with significant comorbidities related to AKI,
including patients with CKD. Although different biomarkers have
a restricted accuracy in predicting the development of AKI in such
a patient population [31], TIMP-2 and IGFB7 showed a very
good performance in predicting AKI. Second, in contrast to other
known biomarkers, [TIMP-2]*[IGFB7] has a very high sensitivity
and specificity not only in diagnosing AKI, but also in predicting
renal recovery in cardiac surgery patients. These results imply that
co-interventions (e.g. application of radiocontrast agents) in
patients who have a high risk of non-recovery of renal function
can be adjusted or rejected. Preventing a second insult in high risk
patients could hamper an aggravation of renal function or improve
renal recovery and subsequently improve long-term outcome
(renal function and survival).
There are several limitations to our study. First, our study
represents the results from a relatively small number of patients
from a single center. It is acknowledged that our results, although
of clear clinical and statistical significance, will need to be
validated in a larger population. This is important, because
previous biomarker studies [40] that started in small cohorts
showed extraordinary results were outliners when subsequently
studied in lager cohorts. Second, we are unable to provide long
term data from these patients. It would have been very interesting
to investigate renal function and mortality 90 days and 1 year after
cardiac surgery. Third, renal recovery is not necessarily general￾izable, because we tested the course of TIMP-2 and IGFBP7
concentrations early after a defined insult. In clinical practice, it is
very uncommon to know the onset of AKI. Therefore, future
studies have to investigate whether the course of TIMP-2 and
IGFBP7 concentrations at later time points or after the onset of
AKI can predict renal recovery.
In summary, our results indicate that TIMP-2 and IGFBP7 are
early predictive urinary biomarkers of AKI after cardiac surgery.
The combination of these two biomarkers may allow for the
reliable early prediction of AKI at all times after CPB. The course
of urinary TIMP-2 and IGFBP7 concentrations appears to be
useful for predicting renal recovery following cardiac surgery.
