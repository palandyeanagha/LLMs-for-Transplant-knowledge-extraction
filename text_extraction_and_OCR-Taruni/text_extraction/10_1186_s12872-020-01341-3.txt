Abstract
Background: Contrast-induced encephalopathy (CIE) is a rare complication of cardiac catheterization; clinical
manifestations include cortical blindness, seizures and focal neurological deficits. In general, recurrent epileptic
seizures following cardiac catheterization with iodixanol occur more rarely than do other complications.
Case presentation: Here, we report a case of a 76-year-old male patient who experienced unstable angina for
nearly 10 months and was admitted to our hospital. Repeat cardiac catheterization was performed using iodixanol.
At approximately 20 h after the first cardiac catheterization, his upper limbs began to exhibit slight trembling; the
patient was conscious and could not control these movements. A total of 6 episodes occurred before the second
cardiac catheterization was performed, with each episode lasting approximately 2 s. These symptoms were not
treated. At approximately 2 h after the second cardiac catheterization, the symptoms became more severe, and the
frequency of the episodes increased significantly; the symptoms had fully subsided at 6 h after the second
operation. An electroencephalogram (EEG) demonstrated diffuse slowing with epileptiform abnormalities.
Paroxysmal spike-wave and slow wave discharges were observed in the bilateral areas, and the abnormalities were
marked in the frontal areas. These observations led us to conclude that the patient was experiencing epileptic
seizures. During 6 months of monthly clinical follow-up visits after discharge, no abnormalities of the nervous
system were found by cardiologists or neurologists, and the patient’s EEG was normal. No antiepileptic drugs were
administered throughout this process.
Conclusions: CIE, especially recurrent epileptic seizures, is a rare but often reversible complication of cardiac
catheterization with iodixanol. Its symptoms can be mild and therefore are easily ignored by physicians. Early CIE
detection may be achieved by EEG. Repeated exposure to contrast agents carries the risk of recurrent epileptic
seizures.

Background
Contrast-induced encephalopathy (CIE) due to the use
of contrast agents is a rare complication of cardiac
catheterization [1, 2]. The clinical manifestations of CIE
include cortical blindness, seizures and focal neuro￾logical deficits [1, 2]. Although many factors have been
considered as possible causes of CIE, current theories
suggest a direct neurotoxic effect due to osmotic disrup￾tion of the blood-brain barrier [2]. In the present study,
we report the case of a patient diagnosed with recurrent
epileptic seizures after cardiac catheterization with
iodixanol.
Case presentation
A 76-year-old male patient of Asian descent who had
experienced unstable angina for nearly 10 months was
admitted to our hospital and was scheduled to undergo
elective coronary angiography (CAG) a few days later.
He had a history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes and
transient ischaemic attacks (TIAs); he was diagnosed
with type 2 diabetes 10 months previously but did not
receive any treatment. He had smoked one pack of

cigarettes per day for approximately50 years. There was
no history of epilepsy in his family.
Physical examination revealed no pathologies; further￾more, no pathological results were obtained based on
laboratory findings, and his cardiac enzyme levels (CK￾MB, 1.17 ng/ml; troponin-I < 0.1 ng/ml) were normal. An
electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed ST segment depres￾sion in leads II, III and aVF (Fig. 1). Transthoracic echo￾cardiography demonstrated a normal left ventricular
ejection fraction of 0.58.According to brain magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI), mild stenosis of the cerebral
arteries and anterior communicating artery aneurysms
were present, with no recent cerebral ischaemia.
Four days after admission, cardiac catheterization was
performed via the transradial approach. CAG revealed
diffuse calcification from the proximal to the middle
portion of the left anterior descending artery (LAD),
resulting in approximately 90 and 60% stenosis in the
left main coronary artery. The left circumflex artery
(LCX) was very small. The right coronary artery (RCA)
exhibited approximately 80% stenosis. However, because
the coronary artery was severely calcified, the lesion
could not be completely expanded. We suggested that
rotational atherectomy (RA) should be performed by ex￾perts. For this procedure, a total of 80 ml of iodixanol
(osmolality, 290 mOsm/kg H2O, which is the same as
blood) was administered. At approximately 20 h after
CAG, the patient’s upper limbs began to tremble
slightly. The patient was conscious and could not con￾trol these movements. He did not call a physician, and
no detailed examination was performed. A total of 6
episodes occurred during the 4 days before the second
cardiac catheterization was performed. Each episode
lasted approximately 2 s, and the episodes often oc￾curred at night. As these symptoms were ignored, no
treatment was administered.
Eight days after admission, RA was performed by an
expert, and a 1.25-mm burr was gradually advanced into
the lesion at 150,000 rpm until the burr finally passed
through the lesion in the LAD. Following this procedure,
two drug-eluting stents (DESs) were implanted in the
distal (Firebird 2.75 × 33 mm, Microport) and middle
(Firebird 3.0 × 33 mm, Microport) portions of the LAD.
Another DES (Firebird 3.5 × 29 mm, Microport) was
implanted in the proximal portion of the LAD and
crossed over into the left main artery. Finally, another
DES (Firebird 3.5 × 13 mm, Microport) was implanted in
the middle portion of the RCA. The patient was manu￾ally administered 150 ml of iodixanol. At approximately
2 h after cardiac catheterization, his upper limbs again
began to tremble slightly, and although he was still
conscious, he could not control these movements. His
symptoms subsequently became more serious, and the
frequency of the episodes increased significantly. The
patient’s neurological examination, vital signs, ECG, and
serum glucose levels were normal; parameters related to
liver and kidney function, electrolyte levels and thyroid
function were also normal. His symptoms began to grad￾ually attenuate 3 h later and had fully subsided at 6 h
after the second operation. Neurologists recommended
an electroencephalogram (EEG) examination, which was
performed over two hours on the second day. The results
showed diffuse slowing with epileptiform abnormalities;
paroxysmal spike-wave and slow wave discharges were
observed in the bilateral areas (Fig. 2), and the abnormal￾ities were marked in the frontal areas (Fig. 2). The patient
refused to undergo computed tomography (CT) or MRI.
During 6 months of monthly clinical follow-up after dis￾charge, no abnormalities of the nervous system were
found by cardiologists and neurologists, and his EEG
results were normal (Fig. 3). Throughout this process, no
antiepileptic drugs were given.

Discussion and conclusion
The most common known side effects of iodinated con￾trast agents after CAG include hypersensitivity reactions
and contrast-induced nephropathy [1, 2]. CIE is a rare
complication of cardiac catheterization and is often an
acute reversible encephalopathy that occurs within minutes
to hours after the procedure [1]. In our case, the patient’s
upper limbs trembled slightly after the first operation,
though these symptoms were ignored. His symptoms then
became slightly more severe, and the frequency of the
episodes increased significantly after the second operation.
An EEG demonstrated diffuse slowing with epileptiform
abnormalities. At 6 months after discharge, no abnormality
was found in the patient’s nervous system, and his EEG
results were normal; no antiepileptic drugs were adminis￾tered. Although a cranial imaging examination was not
performed, we believe that the patient experienced from
CIE and epileptic seizures.
The mechanism by which contrast agents induce
neurological injury has not been clearly elucidated. Stud￾ies have suggested that CIE occurs when the integrity of
the blood-brain barrier is disrupted [1–3], allowing con￾trast medium to permeate the central nervous system,
where it subsequently causes damage via direct neuronal
toxicity [3]. Previous studies have also shown that iodine
contrast agents may promote transient vasoconstriction
[4]. In cases of CIE reported in the literature, the con￾trast media mostly consisted of high- and low-osmolality
agents, such as iohexol, ioversol, and iopromide [1, 5–7].
Iso-osmolar contrast agents are not thought to cause
CIE; however, cases of iso-osmolar contrast medium￾induced CIE (iodixanol) have been reported, though they
are rare [8–10]. In our case, the patient presented CIE
after cardiac catheterization with iodixanol, yet the cause
was unclear. The patient’s brain MRI showed mild sten￾osis of the cerebral arteries and anterior communicating
artery aneurysms. We speculate that CIE may be related
to anterior communicating artery aneurysms, and the in￾tegrity of the blood-brain barrier may have been much
more easily disrupted than in other cases.
In the literature, CIE is often described as an acute
and severe complication of cardiac catheterization [1, 2].
Brain CT and MRI are important for diagnosing CIE
and can exclude thromboembolism and haemorrhage
[2]. Characteristic CT findings include cortical or sub￾cortical contrast enhancement, cerebral oedema, and
hyperdensity in the subarachnoid space [1, 2]. Nonethe￾less, neuroimaging results maybe normal in some cases
[11]. We did not perform CT or MRI in our study. The
patient’s upper limbs trembled, indicating mild symp￾toms, but he refused to undergo CT or MRI because a
brain MRI had been performed immediatelybefore the
cardiac catheterization was performed. We consider the
lack of neuroimaging a limitation of this study.
EEG abnormalities after cardiac catheterization have
been reported [5–7, 12]. In some cases, EEG shows diffuse
slowing. In our case, an EEG was performed after the pa￾tient’s symptoms disappeared, and the results demon￾strated diffuse slowing with epileptiform abnormalities
(paroxysmal spike-wave and slow wave discharges in the
bilateral areas). Regardless, the times of appearance and
disappearance of these abnormal EEG episodes are un￾known in our case. Similarly, other studies have not indi￾cated the time at which patients were diagnosed with CIE.
Therefore, the duration of abnormal EEG results is worth
exploring in future studies. Symptoms usually appear
within minutes to hours after contrast administration, are
serious, potentially including cortical blindness, seizures
and focal neurological deficits, and are easy to identify and
treat with interventions in the early stages [1]. In particu￾lar, Eleftheriou A et al. reported a patient who was diag￾nosed withlate CIE at approximately 22 h after CAG [10].
In our case, the symptoms were mild at first and were
therefore ignored by doctors. A late diagnosis ofCIE is a
dangerous situation for both patients and doctors. There￾fore, if an EEG is performed immediately following cardiac
catheterization, especially in patients with many risk fac￾tors for CIE, the associated abnormalities can be identified
on the EEG results, and pre-intervention techniques can
be performed to avoid adverse consequences. Thus, EEG
may represent an early detection method for CIE.
Repeated exposure to contrast agents carries the risk
of recurrent CIE. Law et al. reported a case in which the
patient exhibitedrecurrent CIE and presented symptoms
that manifested as homonymous hemianopia [9]. The
patient had previously experienced a transient binocular
vision disturbance following cardiac catheterization.
Spina et al. also described recurrent CIE [13], whereby
CIE manifested as transient limb weakness and aphasia
following a first cardiac catheterization, and despite pre￾medication with intravenous corticosteroids, aphasia oc￾curred following the second cardiac catheterization. In
our case, two coronary angiograms were performed, and
the symptoms became more severe after the second
cardiac catheterization. We suggest thatthe repeated
use of these contrast agents likely worsened the pa￾tient’s neurologic symptoms and perpetuated the dis￾ease process. A previous study reported that patients
who had a prior history of CIE and underwent repeat
coronary angiogram with limited agent volumes and
adequate hydration did not experience CIE [1]. Hence,
if a patient has thoracalgia and must undergo repeated
CAG, some interventions (such as pre-medication and
the use of limited agent volumes and adequate hydra￾tion) can be performed to help avoid serious adverse
reactions in the future.
In conclusion, CIE, especially recurrent epileptic sei￾zures, is a rare complication of cardiac catheterization

with iodixanol. CIE is often reversible. Its symptoms can
be mild and are easily ignored by doctors. EEG may
constitute a means of detecting CIE in the early stages.
In general, repeated exposure to contrast agents carries
the risk of recurrent epileptic seizures.
