Chronic Allograft Dysfunction: A Model Disorder of 
Innate Immunity
Walter Gottlieb Land
The innate immune system is a highly sensitive organ of perception 
sensing any cell stress and tissue injury. Its major type of response to all 
potential inciting and dangerous challenges is inflammation and tissue 
repair and, if needed, induction of a supportive adaptive immune response, 
the aim always being to maintain homeostasis. However, although 
initially beneficial, innate immunity‑mediated, protection‑intended 
repair processes become pathogenic when they are exaggerated and 
uncontrolled, resulting in permanent fibrosis which replaces atrophic or 
dying tissue and may lead to organ dysfunction or even failure. In this sense, 
atherosclerosis and organ fibrosis reflect classical disorders caused by an 
overreacting innate immune system. Strikingly, these two pathologies 
dominate the development of chronic allograft dysfunction as the main 
clinical problem still left in transplantation medicine. Growing evidence 
suggests that acute and chronic allograft injuries, including alloimmune‑, 
isoimmune‑, nonimmune‑, and infection‑mediated insults, not only lead to cell death–associated 
graft atrophy but also activate the innate immune system which, over time, leads to uncontrolled 
intragraft fibrogenesis, thereby compromising allograft function. Acute and chronic allograft injuries 
lead to induction of damage‑associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) which, after recognition by 
pattern recognition receptors, activate cells of the innate immune system such as donor‑derived 
intragraft fibroblasts and vascular cells as well as recipient‑derived graft‑invading macrophages and 
leukocytes. It is mainly the orchestrated action and function of these cells that slowly but steadily 
metamorphose the originally life‑saving allograft into a poorly functioning organ of marginal viability.

Adecade ago, we proposed that chronic allograft 
rejection, also called as chronic allograft dysfunc‑
tion (CAD), results from antigen‑dependent and anti‑
gen‑independent allograft injuries that elicit innate immune 
responses leading to fibrotic processes in the allograft as 
reflected by alloatherosclerosis and allofibrosis.[1,2] In view 
of incredible progress in research on innate immunity, it is 
becoming apparent that our concept is largely true. Accord‑
ingly, in this article, recent evidence is collected in support 
of the notion that the etiopathogenesis of CAD – besides 
progressive loss of parenchymal cells – is dominated by 
the processes of the donor’s and recipient’s innate immune 
system activated by various types of acute and chronic al‑
lograft injuries.
In the past, the innate immune system was primar‑
ily seen as a host defense system with its primary task 
to eliminate the invading pathogens. However, these 
views have changed. Today, the system is regarded as 
a highly sensitive organ of perception sensing any cell 
stress and tissue injury. The system’s major type of 
response to all these different inciting and dangerous 
challenges is inflammation.[3] The aim of the response

is to provide any kind of protection including killing 
of invading pathogens, removing dead cells, repairing 
destroyed tissue, balancing metabolic or psychological 
irregularities, and finally, when foreign antigens are in‑
volved (such as microbial antigens, altered self‑antigens, 
or alloantigens), inducing a supportive adaptive immune 
response. However, although initially beneficial, these in‑
nate immunity‑mediated, protection‑intended tissue repair 
processes become pathogenic when they are exaggerated 
and uncontrolled, resulting in deregulated cell differentia‑
tion and proliferation as well as substantial deposition of 
extracellular matrix (ECM) components in which severely 
damaged, atrophic, or dying tissue is replaced with per‑
manent fibrotic tissue [Figure 1].
Thus, histology of chronically deteriorating allograft 
function, as for example observed in renal,[4] heart,[5] and 
lung transplantation,[6] is dominated by a variety of fibrosing 
changes in the (micro) vasculature (alloatherosclerosis) and 
the interstitium (allofibrosis), often seen in the absence of 
acute inflammatory cellular infiltrates. Accordingly, CAD 
may be regarded as a model disorder of injury‑induced, in‑
nate immunity‑mediated atherosclerosis and organ fibrosis 
as a consequence of allograft injury‑induced cell death and 
atrophy. The unique feature of this model is the fact that 
the innate immune system is activated by both immune and 
nonimmune allograft injuries.
In order to cover this topic, recent selected data from 
the exploding international literature are explored by high‑
lighting innate immune mechanisms reported to be involved 
in injury‑induced atherogenesis and fibrogenesis. Of note, 
because of space limitations, most references are review 
articles in which the original citations can be found.
Injury‑induced, innate immunity‑mediated 
infectious and “sterile” inflammation
Current notions in immunology hold that not only 
pathogen‑mediated injury but also any tissue injury associ‑
ated with cell damage activates the innate immune system 
that elicits an infectious or “sterile” inflammatory response. 
In fact, the phenomenon that “injury induces immunity”
was discovered by our group two decades ago[7‑9] and was 
intrinsically designed and described by Matzinger within her 
famous danger theory.[10,11] Whilst infectious tissue injury is 
associated with the presence of pathogen‑associated molecu‑
lar patterns(PAMPs),[12] non–pathogen‑mediated injury leads 
to the induction of so‑called damage‑associated molecular 
patterns, the DAMPs, as first described by us in 2003. Nota‑
bly, tissue‑damaging infectious pathogens may even induce 
DAMPs that finally trigger a vigorous anti‑pathogen innate 
immune response [Figure 2].[13,14] DAMPs, like PAMPs sensed 
by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) such as Toll‑like re‑
ceptors(TLRs) and NOD‑like receptors(NLRs), include the 
prototypic high‑mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), heat shock 
proteins (HSPs), oxidized/minimally modified low‑density 
lipoproteins(oxLDL/mmLDL), as well as endogenous DNA 
and RNA released from dying cells.[15‑17]
Of note, the development of infectious and sterile in‑
flammation, and also inflammation‑mediated atherosclerosis 
and fibrosis is promoted – though not exclusively – by the 
function of inflammasomes, the two most extensively stud‑
ied being the NLR‑containing pyrin domain 3 (NLRP3) and 
the absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2) inflammasome. The char‑
acteristic function of these “molecular machines” of the in‑
nate immune system is to secrete interleukin‑1 beta (IL‑1β) 
and IL‑18 that mature from their proforms to bioactive 
cytokines through proteolytic cleavage by caspase‑1.[18‑21]
Modern notions hold that full function of the NLRP3 
inflammasome is a two‑step process. The first step, the prim‑
ing step, consists of stimulation of PRRs such as TLRs and 
leads, via transcriptional processes, to the up‑regulation of 
NLRP3 and expression of pro‑IL‑1β and pro‑IL‑18 in the 
cytosol. The activation step is distinct from this initial prim‑
ing step and reportedly mediated by various mechanistic 
pathways. Certain DAMPs such as reactive oxygen spe‑
cies (ROS)‑induced oxidized proteins or extracellular ade‑
nosine triphosphate (eATP), uric acid, and nucleic acids(en‑
dogenous DNA, RNA) known to be released from damaged 
or dying cells appear to play a critical role in the activation 
of the NLRP3 inflammasome, with the double‑stranded 
RNA‑dependent protein kinase (PKR) also being shown 
Figure 1: The innate immune system: A highly sensitive organ 
of perception sensing any cell stress and tissue injury. The highly 
conserved first‑line defense system as represented by most somatic 
cells reacts to any tissue injury with an inflammatory response aiming 
to eliminate the inciting and dangerous challenges and to repair 
the destroyed tissue, thereby maintaining homeostasis. However, 
when uncontrolled and exaggerated, the system leads to diseases 
and pathologies including allograft acute and chronic allograft 
rejection. (DAMPs, damage‑associated molecular patterns; PAMPs,

to be involved recently [Figure 3].[14,22‑25] Nevertheless, the 
exact activating mechanism is still elusive; probably, any, 
even the slightest intra‑ or extracellular alteration of the 
microenvironment may activate this inflammasome.[26,27]
Innate immunity and atherosclerosis
Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease in 
which both innate and adaptive (auto) immune mechanisms 
are involved [Figure 4].[16,28‑31] The atherosclerotic plaque 
is characterized by an accumulation of lipids in the artery 
wall, together with infiltration of immune cells such as 
macrophages, mast cells, and T cells, and the formation 
of a fibrous cap composed mostly of collagen by vascular 
smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). The innate immune sys‑
tem of the normal artery represents the starting point of 
atherogenesis by responding to any inciting agent includ‑
ing oxidative, metabolic, mechanical, biotoxic, or infec‑
tious stress. PRR‑bearing sessile cells such as endothelial 
cells (ECs) and VSMCs, exposed to injurious challenges, 
mount a primary inflammatory response in the arterial wall 
that is secondarily aggravated by the action of mobile cells 
such as macrophages, neutrophils, mast cells, and dendritic 
cells (DCs) infiltrating the subendothelial space. This pro‑
cess is associated with the transformation of quiescent con‑
tractile VSMCs that proliferate and migrate to the neointima 
where they produce ECM proteins leading to accumulation 
of fibrous tissue – a process that is pivotal for the onset and 
progression of atherosclerosis.
DAMPs/PAMPs–PRRs engagement in atherosclerotic 
inflammation
Numerous studies have identified oxidative stress‑in‑
duced DAMPs as the major activators of vascular inflam‑
mation leading to atherosclerosis.[32] Thus, atherogenesis 
starts with subendothelial retention and accumulation of 
circulating low‑density lipoprotein (LDL) that undergoes 
various oxidative modifications.[29,30] During the progression 
of atherosclerosis, most of these ROS‑induced DAMPs are 
found in various forms of oxLDL and mmLDL.[16] Further, 
oxidation‑specific epitopes, for example, those derived 
from oxLDL, appear to play a prominent role by forming a 
distinct family of DAMPs consisting of various categories 
of oxidative reactions. Oxidation‑specific epitopes that also 
possess antigenic properties operate as ligands for a common 
set of PRRs including natural IgM antibodies, their binding 
leading to activation of the complement cascade.[16,33,34]
Other injury‑induced DAMPs such as HSPs[35] and 
HMGB1 known to bind to the receptor for advanced glycation 
end products(RAGE), TLR4 and TLR2 on vascular cells,[36,37]
are also involved in establishing a vascular inflammatory 
cascade contributing to atherogenesis.[38] Of note, DAMPs 
such as HMGB1 and mmLDL were shown to participate in 
Figure 2: Schematic illustration of mutual generation of PAMPs and DAMPs during pathogen‑mediated and non‑pathogen‑mediated tissue 
injury. Tissue damaging infectious pathogens may induce DAMPs that finally trigger a vigorous anti‑pathogen inflammatory response; 
conversely, tissue primarily damaged by non‑infectious agents is prone to get contaminated with pathogens that may lead to a life‑threatening 
overshooting inflammatory response. (Ag, antigen; ALRs, AIM2‑like receptors; NLRs, nucleotide‑binding oligomerization domain‑like

VSMC phenotype transformation,[39‑41] as HSP70 was found 
to increase ECM production by human VSMCs through 
up‑regulation of transforming growth factor‑beta1 (TGF‑β1) 
expression.[42] These observations indicate a direct role of 
DAMPs in the establishment of neointima formation leading 
to arterial wall remodeling [Figure 4].
Besides DAMPs, a number of various PRRs includ‑
ing TLRs, NLRs, and RAGE were shown to mediate 
atherosclerotic inflammation and contribute to plaque 
formation.[43‑46] Of particular interest amongst those recep‑
tors is the lectin‑like oxidized LDL receptor‑1 (LOX‑1) that 
was found to be expressed in ECs and VSMCs and to be 
highly up‑regulated in atherosclerosis.[47]
The possibility that infectious agents via generation 
of PAMPs provoke relevant innate immune responses to 
arteries has been considered, but little evidence supports 
a primary impact, though contributory roles are possible. 
Accordingly, a large number of infectious agents report‑
edly have been linked with an increased risk of vascular 
disease, including Chlamydia pneumonia, Porphyromonas 
gingivalis, Helicobacter pylori, influenza A virus, herpes 
virus, hepatitis C virus (HCV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), 
and human immunodeficiency virus.[48,49]
Role of the NLRP3 inflammasome in atherogenesis
Of note, the discovery of the inflammasome protein 
complex, located in both sessile and infiltrated vascular 
cells, has shed some more light on the mechanisms in‑
volved in mounting vascular inflammation involved in 
atherogenesis.[50] In particular, studies on murine and hu‑
man phagocytes and in vivo settings revealed that crystals 
of cholesterol – operating as DAMPs – activate the NLRP3 
inflammasome required for atherogenesis.[51‑53] Remarkably, 
more recent investigations in NLRP3‑deficient mice 
Figure 3: Oversimplified scenario model of (oxidative) injury‑induced activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Priming through DAMPs 
such as HMGB1 induces ROS‑dependent, transcription factor‑mediated up‑regulation of NLRP3 receptor (rather to be regarded as a sensor) 
and production of pro‑IL‑1β (and pro‑IL‑18 not shown in this figure). Finite activation of the inflammasome is provided by another class of 
DAMPs which are directly or indirectly sensed by NLRP3 via various mechanisms. Out of various proposed putative mechanisms, the figure 
selectively illustrates only: (I) activation via direct sensing of DAMPs such as mitochondrial ROS‑modified thioreodoxin, the TXNIP and 
(II) activation via indirect sensing of DAMPs such as (1) cholesterol crystals which may drive NLRP3 activation through its internalization 
leading to phagolysosome destabilization associated with leakage of cathepsin B and (2) extracellular ATP which may activate NLRP3 by 
binding to the ionotropic P2X7 receptor leading to ion fluxes such as K+ efflux through the P2X7 receptor and other ion hemichannels such as 
pannexin‑1. Although the exact mechanisms are still unclear, activation of NLRP3 allows inflammasome complex formation and maturation 
of pro‑IL‑1β (and pro‑IL‑18) via caspases‑1 cleavage to secretion of bioactive IL‑1β (and IL‑18 not shown here). Then, these key cytokines, 
in an autocrine or paracrine manner, lead to receptor‑triggered transcriptional pathways resulting in the production of further proinflammatory 
mediator substances to create full‑scale tissue inflammation. (eATP, extracellular adenosine triphosphate; HMGB1, high mobility group box 1;

provided evidence even indicating that the NLRP3 inflam‑
masome plays a crucial, non‑redundant role in vascular 
damage‑mediated neointima formation.[54] Activation of the 
NLRP3 inflammasome in these settings is not quite clear. 
Of interest, however, are studies suggesting that oxidative 
stress – in its own or via induction of oxLDL – may oper‑
ate as the “priming” DAMP in the early course of NLRP3 
activation [Figures 3 and 4].[53‑56]
Interplay between innate immunity and adaptive 
immunity in atherogenesis
Adaptive immunity is not a prerequisite for athero‑
genesis, but its presence profoundly affects lesion forma‑
tion and, on balance, is proatherogenic. Indeed, extensive 
data now support the notion that T cells, mainly Th1 cells 
in conjunction with interferon‑gamma (IFN‑γ), mediate 
proinflammatory and proatherogenic immune responses.[31]
Current notions hold that immunostimulatory DCs in the 
arterial wall, activated after recognition of DAMPs through 
PRRs, engulf and process stress/injury‑induced neoantigens in 
terms of altered/modified self‑proteins generated in early ath‑
erosclerotic lesions(or systemically), such as the oxidatively 
modified apolipoprotein B‑100 component of LDL, HSPs, 
and others. The vascular autostimulatory DCs, then, present 
these altered self‑proteins as peptide/major histocompatibility 
complex (MHC) complexes to naïve T cells in secondary lym‑
phoid tissues, leading to T cell clonal expansion and differen‑
tiation into effector Th1 cells, probably also Th17 cells.[29,31]
The effector T cells migrate into arterial lesions where they 
cause further vascular injury leading to induction of DAMPs 
that again initiate proinflammatory and/or profibrotic innate 
immune pathways (a vicious circle) [Figure 4].
However, the adaptive autoimmune response, in par‑
ticular, during the early phases of atherogenesis, can also be 
Figure 4: Scenario model of vascular injury‑induced, innate and adaptive immune responses involved in atherogenesis. Vascular innate immune 
cells, here illustrated by PRR‑bearing, NLRP3 inflammasome‑expressing vascular smooth muscle cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells, 
are activated by various classes of DAMPs induced by vascular injuries. All three cell types exert different innate immune functions which 
orchestrate a network of processes leading to atherosclerosis: (1) activated smooth muscle cells, after recognition of DAMPs by PRRs(including 
NLRP3), contribute to development of intima fibrosis via proliferation and phenotype transformation able to secrete extracellular matrix 
proteins; (2) macrophages, via function of the NLRP3 inflammasome (e.g., activated by “priming” HMGB1 and “activating” cholesterol), 
contribute to creation of vessel wall inflammation; and (3) vascular dendritic cells, activated by recognition of DAMPs, engulf and process 
neoantigens (altered self‑proteins) such as oxidation‑specific epitopes, migrate to secondary lymphoid tissue, and present the peptide/MHC 
complex to naïve T cells. This leads to the initiation and induction of a specific adaptive Th17‑ and/or Th1 autoimmune response that, in terms of 
a vicious circle, may further aggravate the vascular injury. Note: Intracellular signaling pathways as sketched in the macrophage and the smooth 
muscle cell are illustrated in more detail in Figures 3 and 5. [DC, dendritic cell; ECM, extracellular matrix; IL‑1R, interleukin‑1 receptor; MØ,

atheroprotective as reflected, for example, by the generation 
of regulatory T cells(Tregs) that inhibit the activity of auto‑
reactive Th1 effector T cells by release of anti‑inflammatory 
cytokines such as IL‑10 and TGF‑β as well as production of 
protective antibodies. For example, many IgG antibodies to 
oxLDL inhibit the uptake of oxLDL by macrophages, at least 
in culture, suggesting that they should inhibit atherogenesis. 
As the disease progresses, this control is gradually lost and 
the immune responses toward plaque‑associated neoantigens 
switch toward activation of Th1 or Th17 effector T cells and 
release of proinflammatory cytokines such as IFN‑γ and 
tumor necrosis factor‑alpha as well as profibrotic IL‑17.[31,57]
Innate immunity and fibrosis
Normal injury‑induced, innate immune‑mediated tissue 
repair can evolve into a progressively irreversible fibrotic 
response if the tissue injury is severe or repetitively chronic, 
or if the innate immune response becomes uncontrolled and 
exaggerated. “Fibrogenic” injury to tissues and organs can 
result from various inciting factors including chronic auto‑
immune responses, persistent infections, recurrent exposure 
to toxins, irritants, and mechanical injury, for example, 
mediated by hypertension.
The type of innate immune cells heavily involved 
in the extensive tissue damage and tissue repair is the 
fibroblast which operates as a sentinel cell[58] and can be 
derived from resident fibroblasts, from circulating fibro‑
cytes, or by epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT).[59]
Persistently activated fibroblasts called myofibroblasts 
mediate the excessive secretion of collagen in chronically 
injured organs and tissues. Myofibroblasts are pheno‑
typically characterized by increased α‑smooth muscle 
actin (α‑SMA). The key molecule TGF‑β, in concert 
with other profibrotic cytokines and downstream growth 
factors such as the connective tissue growth factor, can 
induce the full repertoire of fibrotic responses and plays 
a direct role in fibroblast proliferation/differentiation and 
deposition of ECM proteins.[60] TGF‑β is ubiquitously 
expressed and produced by multiple cell types in three 
isoforms (TGF‑β1, ‑2, and ‑3) in mammals (T cells being 
its essential source), but is kept latent and bound mostly 
to ECM components by non‑covalent association with 
its propeptide, the latency associated peptide (LAP).[61,62]
Thus, the activation of TGF‑β, a crucial point of regulation 
in TGF‑β function, is primarily regulated by conversion of 
latent TGF‑β to active TGF‑β and involves proteolysis of 
LAP or conformation changes of the latent TGF‑β caused 
by several factors such as proteases, ROS, and integrins. 
In particular, binding of the ECM receptors integrin αvβ6 
and αvβ8 to the integrin‑binding domain of the LAP of 
TGF‑β1 (causing cleavage of LAP and release of mature 
TGF‑β peptide) represents a major mechanism of TGF‑β1 
activation in vivo.
[61‑65] Activated members of the TGF‑β
family function through interaction with TGF‑β recep‑
tors (type I and type II) that elicit Smad‑dependent and 
Smad‑independent signaling pathways [Figure 5].[66]
Another type of innate immune cells, the macrophage, 
always found in close proximity with collagen‑producing 
myofibroblasts, also plays a key role in fibrosis indisput‑
ably. Obviously, damaged parenchymal cells, such as 
tubular cells in the kidney, produce inflammatory cyto‑
kines and chemokines that subsequently promote intense 
macrophage infiltration. Of note, however, depending 
on the cytokine microenvironment, a certain class of 
macrophages with an “alternative activation state,” the 
M2 macrophages that are distinct from proinflamma‑
tory “classically activated macrophages” (the M1 mac‑
rophages), appears to predominantly operate as those 
profibrotic macrophages.[67]
DAMPs/PAMPs–PRRs engagement in fibrotic 
inflammation
The dominating cells involved in fibrogenesis, fibro‑
blasts, fibroblast‑like cells, M2 macrophages, and epithelial 
cells are equipped with various innate immune receptors. 
Although intense clinical studies and experimental inves‑
tigations have just been started, growing evidence already 
suggests that PRRs such as TLR2, TLR3, TLR4, TLR9, and 
RAGE play a dominant role in fibrogenesis, for example, 
via augmentation of TGF‑β activity.[68‑77]
Of high interest are recent studies on various models, 
indicating a role of DAMPs such as HMGB1 in initiating 
molecular and cellular processes leading to fibrogenesis.[78‑80]
Further, in other lines of studies on murine fibrotic models, 
extracellular HSP70 and fibrinogen (interacting with TLR2 
and TLR4 on renal fibroblasts) were shown to act as DAMPs 
exerting profibrotic properties.[81,82]
In analogy to DAMPs, PAMPs such as LPS have 
also been demonstrated to act as “profibrotic” molecules 
in chronic PRR‑mediated innate immune responses.[83] In 
addition, infections with double‑stranded DNA (dsDNA) 
viruses such as CMV and BK polyomavirus infection have 
been shown to contribute to fibrogenesis, presumably via 
activation of fibroblasts through DNA receptors such as the 
gamma‑interferon‑inducible protein 16 (IFI16) receptor[84,85]
and/or AIM2 receptor.[86]
Role of the NLRP3 inflammasome in fibrogenesis
Recent studies on fibroblasts and different organs 
have convincingly demonstrated that the innate immune 
sensor NLRP3, mostly inflammasome dependent,[87‑89] but 
also inflammasome independent,[90] plays a crucial role in 
fibrogenesis and can orchestrate profibrotic innate immune 
responses under both infectious and sterile conditions.

In fact, it is now significantly apparent that the key 
products of the NLRP3 inflammasome, IL‑1β and IL‑18, 
exert profibrotic activities.[91‑95] Studies on the experimental 
fibrosis model of bleomycin (BLM)‑induced lung injury 
revealed a role of the DAMPs uric acid and eATP that 
are released from damaged cells and activate the NLRP3 
inflammasome leading to IL‑1β production and lung fibro‑
sis. In associated studies on this model, it was shown that 
IL‑1β production is dependent on TLR2, TLR4, myeloid 
differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88), and 
interleukin‑1 receptor type 1 (IL‑1R1) pathways.
Of note, mechanistic studies on the BLM model in 
deficient mice revealed the existence of an early IL‑1β
→ IL‑23 → IL‑17 (IL‑17A) axis leading to inflamma‑
tion and fibrosis, probably via promotion of proliferation, 
transformation, and collagen synthesis of fibroblasts.[96‑99]
Of note, recent studies lent support to the assumption that 
this axis operates upstream of the expression of TGF‑β
in terms of IL‑1β–induced transcriptional activation of 
TGF‑β, for example, via up‑regulation of integrin αvβ8 
expression on the cell surface. Active TGF‑β, in an auto‑/
paracrine manner, then, binds to fibroblast TGF‑β recep‑
tors [Figures 5 and 6].[100‑102]
Further studies provided evidence indicating a role of 
IL‑1β and IL‑18, in synergy with IL‑23, for the activation 
of gammadelta (γδ) T cells (including human γδ T cells), 
to secrete (early) proinflammatory IL‑17A, that, in turn, 
promotes fibrogenesis.[97,103‑106] Besides γδ T cells, natural 
killer T (NKT) cells and certain populations of innate 
lymphoid cells – although less pronounced – have been 
shown to secrete proinflammatory IL‑17A supposed to 
contribute to fibrogenesis.[107] Receptor‑triggered signaling 
pathways regulating IL‑17 production by γδ T cells (as also 
by CD4+ Th17 cells, see below) were reportedly shown to 
include the transcription factors retinoic acid‑related orphan 
receptor (RORγt) and signal transducer and activator of 
transcription 3 (STAT3).[108‑110]
Interplay between innate immunity and adaptive (Th17) 
immunity in fibrogenesis
It is increasingly becoming apparent that not only in‑
nate immune responses but also adaptive immune responses

is kept latent and bound mostly to extracellular matrix components by non‑covalent association with its propeptide, the latency associated 
peptide. Activation of the cytokine requires liberation of the TGF‑β dimer from the inactive latent complex with the LAP to active TGF‑β, 
and involves proteolysis of LAP or conformation changes of the latent TGF‑β caused by several factors such as proteases or up‑regulated 
integrins (e.g., αvβ8). For example, binding of latent TGF‑β to αvβ8 leads to the recruitment of a metalloprotease (MMP14) which causes 
cleavage of LAP and release of the active (mature) TGF‑β. Activated members of the TGF‑β family function through interaction with TGF‑β

participate in the differentiation and activation of fibroblasts 
leading to fibrosis. Depending on both the nature of antigenic 
stimulus and the injurious environment, various adaptive 
immune pathways have been described.
Most importantly, there is increasing evidence in‑
dicating a critical proinflammatory and profibrotic role 
of the adaptive Th17‑type immune response. In fact, 
CD4+ Th17 cells, secreting (late) proinflammatory cytokines 
IL‑17A and IL‑17F, are emerging as important drivers of 
fibrosis and were shown to contribute to the pathogenesis 
of many inflammatory and autoimmune diseases.[111,112] The 
DC‑dependent differentiation of Th17 cells is orchestrated 
by an intricate network of positive and negative polarizing 
cytokines and transcriptional regulators in T cells including 
STAT3‑dependent RORγt and RORα. In the center of this 
network, mitogen‑activated protein kinases (MAPKs) (in 
particular, p38α MAPK) signaling and inflammasome 
activation have emerged as critical pathways to program 
TH17 cell differentiation by integrating multiple instructive 
DAMP‑induced signals in DCs.[113‑119]
Accordingly, injury‑induced, Th17‑instructive 
DAMPs are sensed by PRRs on/in DCs which then drive 
Th17 cell differentiation by providing (auto) antigenic, 
costimulatory, and Th17‑polarizing cytokine signals. 
The process to shape and stabilize Th17 development is 
mediated by (1) engulfment and processing by autostimu‑
latory DCs of injury‑induced neoantigens; (2) expres‑
sion of selective costimulatory molecules enforced by 
CD40–CD40L ligation; (3) presence of Th17‑polarizing, 
STAT3‑activating cytokines, that is, IL‑6, IL‑23, and 
inflammasome‑driven IL‑1β/IL‑18 mainly produced by 
DCs but also other innate immune cells; (4) TGF‑β1 
and IL‑21 produced by activated T cells; and finally (5) 
TGF‑β1 produced by Th17 cells themselves in an auto‑
crine manner [Figure 7].[107,113‑122]
Taken together, also in view of the role of γδ T 
cells as mentioned above, these data identify the innate 
IL‑1β → IL‑23 → IL‑17A ↔ TGF‑β1 cytokine axis as an 
important pathway in inflammation‑mediated, innate/adap‑
tive immunity‑driven fibrogenesis.

signaling, to activation of transforming growth factor‑β. “Priming” DAMPs such as HMGB1 and “activating” DAMPs such as uric acid, 
extracellular ATP, or endogenous DNA/RNA (released from dying cells) induce assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome, leading to production of 
IL‑1β (and IL‑18, not shown in the figure). IL‑1β leads to transcription‑mediated up‑regulation of αvβ8 expression by fibroblasts, which results 
in increased conversion of latent to active TGF‑β. Active TGF‑β is secreted from the cells and, in turn, in an autocrine/paracrine manner, binds 
to fibroblast TGF‑β receptors which trigger autocrine/paracrine signaling pathways, leading to transcription‑mediated fibroblast proliferation 
and differentiation as well as collagen deposition. (eATP, extracellular adenosine triphosphate; HMGB1, high mobility group box 1; HSP70,

In addition to Th17‑type responses, Th2‑type immu‑
nity is also a potent key driver of progressive fibrosis. As 
reviewed,[111] Th2 responses are defined by the production of 
IL‑4, IL‑5, and IL‑13, while IL‑13 has emerged as a domi‑
nant profibrotic cytokine that (independently of TGF‑β) has 
been shown to mediate fibrotic tissue remodeling in several 
experimental and natural models of fibrosis. This suggests 
that unlike IL‑17A but like TGF‑β, IL‑13 exerts direct fi‑
brotic activity.[123,124] Interestingly, in contrast to Th17‑ and 
Th2‑type adaptive responses, Th1‑type immunity has been 
demonstrated to convey antifibrotic activity, whereas Tregs 
were found to either suppress or promote fibrosis.[111]
Allograft injury‑induced, innate immunity‑ 
mediated chronic allograft dysfunction
There are multiple injuries to an allograft which, via 
induction of innate immune pathways, may lead to CAD 
[Table 1].[125]
The nature of injuries varies, appears to be partially 
organ specific, and includes causative factors such as allo‑
immune and isoimmune responses, nonimmune‑mediated 
conditions (mechanical, metabolic, and oxidative stress), 
as well as pathogen‑mediated insults. Transplant clinicians 
used to interpret those injuries as risk factors of CAD. Ac‑
cordingly, acute risk factors, divided into antigen‑dependent 
and antigen‑independent factors, have been identified, such

“IL‑1β → IL‑23 → IL‑17A ↔ TGF‑β1 cytokine axis.” Injury‑induced, Th17‑instructive DAMPs are sensed by PRRs on/in DCs, which then 
drive Th17 cell differentiation by providing (auto) antigenic, costimulatory, and Th17‑polarizing cytokine signals. The process to shape and 
stabilize Th17 development is further promoted by (1) IL‑23 and NLRP3 inflammasome‑driven IL‑1β/IL‑18 mainly produced by DCs (as 
shown in this figure), but also other innate immune cells; (2) TGF‑β and IL‑21 produced by activated CD4+ T cells; and finally (3) TGF‑β
produced by Th17 cells themselves in an autocrine manner. This scenario, as reflected by the “IL‑1β → IL‑23 → IL‑17A ↔ TGF‑β1 cytokine 
axis,” represents an important pathway in inflammation‑mediated, innate/adaptive immunity‑driven fibrogenesis. (DC, dendritic cell; ECM,

as injuries mediated by donor brain death, postischemic 
reperfusion injury (IRI), acute rejection episodes, and in‑
fections. Defined chronic risk factors refer to persistently/
repetitively chronic allograft injuries such as subclinically 
ongoing alloimmune‑mediated processes, in particular, 
alloantibody‑mediated attacks,[126] hypertension (mechani‑
cal injury), hyperlipidemia (metabolic stress), and admin‑
istration of organotoxic immunosuppressive drugs such as 
nephrotoxic calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs).
It is apparent that allograft injury‑induced CAD reflects 
a multifactorial event that, in case of severe cell‑destroying 
insults, results from steadily ongoing loss of functioning 
parenchymal cells, and, in case of moderate sublytic insults, 
from accompanying, innate immunity‑mediated inflamma‑
tion. Of note, however, in both situations, injury‑induced, 
innate immunity‑mediated tissue repair mechanisms emerge 
which aggravate and accelerate the continuously deteriorat‑
ing allograft function.
In fact, the histologically visible overshooting repair, 
that is, fibrosing processes such as intima fibrosis (alloath‑
erosclerosis) and interstitial fibrosis(allofibrosis), contribute 
to CAD whereby the strength of their manifestation may 
depend on the organ transplanted. For example, alloathero‑
sclerosis is more pronounced in cardiac allografts (coro‑
nary artery vasculopathy),[127] whereas allofibrosis is more 
frequently observed in renal allografts [interstitial fibrosis 
associated with tubular atrophy (IFTA)].[128] Probably, both 
histologically well‑defined processes accelerate the progres‑
sion of CAD as also recently discussed for chronic renal al‑
lograft dysfunction.[129] In addition to these two “canonical” 
processes, there are typical organ‑specific lesions associated 
with CAD such as the bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome 
following lung transplantation that also reflects an exagger‑
ated repairing response of the donor’s(uncontrolled) innate 
immune system to injury.[130]
In the following, by focusing on the parameters of clini‑
cally well‑defined acute and chronic risk factors of CAD, 
some selected injury‑induced innate immune processes, 
as comprehensively reviewed elsewhere,[131] are briefly 
explored.
Early antigen‑independent allograft injury
Brain death
A decade ago, early experiments on a rat model of 
brain death already revealed a strong influence of brain 
death (BD) condition on chronic graft dysfunction.[132]
Emerging evidence now indicates that BD conditions, 
associated with oxidative stress,[133,134] activate the innate 
immune system that leads to development of an acute 
systemic auto‑inflammatory syndrome. In fact, docu‑
mented parameters involved in BD activated innate im‑
mune events include DAMPs,[135‑137] PRRs, and signaling 
molecules,[136,138,139] complement fragments,[140] cytokines 
such as IL‑1β,
[134,141,142] chemokines,[143] and even matured 
DCs[Table 2].[144,145] On the other hand, in studies on a renal 
isograft model in rats, BD was shown to induce interstitial 
renal fibrosis.[146] In these studies, fibrosis‑inducing fac‑
tors such as up‑regulation of TGF‑β were discussed to be 
important in later progressive fibrotic changes that develop 
over time in kidney isografts.
Postischemic reperfusion injury
The pivotal influence of IRI on CAD is well known 
from an early clinical study of our group in kidney trans‑
plant patients.[7,8,131] Production of ROS during IRI has been 
demonstrated in numerous experiments and also in a clinical 
study on human renal allografts.[147,148]
On the other hand, in studies in rats and mice,[146,149]
IRI was shown to induce severe renal fibrosis several weeks 
after the ROS‑induced insult. In studies on a model of murine 
cardiac isografts, IRI was found to induce atherosclerosis.[150]
Moreover, a role of DAMPs and PRRs in IRI‑mediated 
inflammation (including NLRP3 inflammasome‑mediated 
inflammation) has been documented in numerous trials. In 
fact, there is no doubt that IRI, besides others, leads to the pro‑
duction of proinflammatory cytokines including IL‑1β.

to include specific adaptive alloimmune‑mediated injuries 
induced by acute and/or chronic, T cell–mediated and/or 
antibody‑mediated processes.[155,156] These alloimmuni‑
ty‑mediated inflammatory injuries, in terms of a feedback 
loop, can activate innate immune DCs which elicit again 
an alloimmune response leading to allograft injury (vicious 
circle) [Figure 8].
Classically, lytic or sublytic injuries, reportedly asso‑
ciated with production of ROS and operating in clinically 
manifest or subclinically ongoing acute allograft rejection 
episodes,[157‑159] are thought to be mediated predominantly 
by CD4+ Th1 cells, cytotoxic CD8+ T cells, and comple‑
ment‑binding alloantibodies. In particular, donor‑specific 
antibodies (DSA)‑mediated alloimmunity is currently re‑
garded as an emerging concept of CAD. In fact, DSA cause 
profound changes not only in ECs of the allograft (micro) 
vasculature but also in allograft bronchioles,[160,161] thereby 
fulfilling the prerequisite for induction of DAMPs to initiate 
fibrogenic innate immune processes. Of note, in the early 
phase of a Th1 alloimmune response, involvement of the 
Th17 cell lineage has recently been described to secrete 
IL‑17 which appears to primarily facilitate the recruit‑
ment of leukocytes into the graft, thereby contributing to 
acute rejection (see below).[162,163] Finally, there is already 
preliminary evidence in support of the notion that injury to 
donor ECs induced by non–MHC‑, anti‑EC isoantibodies or 
alloantibodies may contribute to innate immune‑mediated 
alloatherosclerosis.[164,165]
Of note, the first experimental studies on various acute 
and chronic rejection models provided evidence support‑
ing a role for adaptive alloimmune responses in activating 
innate immune responses via induction of DAMPs such as 
HMGB1 and HSPs, that is, agonists for TLR2/TLR4 and 
RAGE.[166‑169] In another line of experiments, DAMP (cyto‑
solic DNA)‑activated human DCs were found to be potent 
activators of the adaptive immune response.[170] In support 
of this observation is a study on a model of cardiac allograft 
rejection demonstrating up‑regulation of the apoptosis‑re‑
lated inflammasome.[171] Moreover, recent experiments 
demonstrated that HMGB1 induces IL‑17–producing T cells 
to mediate the early stage of cardiac allograft rejection in 
mice.[172] Together, these new findings provide first clues 
that the NLRP3 inflammasome is already activated dur‑
ing alloimmune‑mediated acute rejection episodes to start 
contributing to the establishment of the innate fibrogenic 
IL‑1β → IL‑23 → IL‑17A ↔ TGF‑β1 cytokine axis.
Figure 8: Scenario model: allograft injury‑induced, innate immune‑mediated chronic allograft dysfunction. Multiple acute and chronic allograft 
injuries, caused by allo‑ and isoimmune responses and/or nonimmune‑mediated conditions(mechanical, metabolic, and oxidative stress) and/or 
infections, activate donor‑derived innate immune cells (such as intragraft vascular cells, fibroblasts, and epithelial cells) and recipient‑derived 
cells(such as graft‑invading macrophages and leukocytes). The activated innate immune system responds to those various insults with allograft 
inflammation that, in turn, promotes development of alloatherosclerosis and allofibrosis. Together with injury‑induced, cell death–associated 
atrophy, these innate immune events ultimately lead to chronic allograft dysfunction. Note the vicious circle of this scenario: Allograft injuries 
activate the innate immune system that elicits an adaptive allo‑ and isoimmune response leading to immune‑mediated allograft injury that, 
in turn, activates the innate immune system again. (alloMHC, donor major histocompatibility complex; DC, dendritic cells; HLA, human 
leukocyte antigens; neoAgs, neoantigens)

In addition, DAMPs such as oxidation‑specific DAMPs 
and/or injury‑induced DAMPs such as HMGB1 and HSPs 
demonstrated in acute and chronic rejection models[166‑169]
may well act in terms of “NLRP3 inflammasome‑priming” 
DAMPs that, in cooperation with cholesterol crystals or 
other “NLRP3 inflammasome‑activating” DAMPs, are 
able to create an inflammatory milieu in the donor (micro) 
vasculature, contributing to alloatherogenesis, a scenario 
that has been discussed in quite a similar way elsewhere,[173]
and is emphasized in regard to native atherosclerosis in more 
recently published reports.[174,175]
Thus, although experimental and clinical data in sup‑
port of such a concept are still sparse, one may discuss the 
possibility that acute and persistently/repetitively chronic 
adaptive alloimmune processes may promote the devel‑
opment of innate immune‑mediated fibrotic processes as 
reflected by alloatherosclerosis and interstitial allofibrosis.
Th17 isoimmunity‑mediated injury
The establishment of de novo Th17 autoimmunity/
autoreactivity that, besides Th1‑type alloimmunity/allore‑
activity, contributes to development of CAD is increasingly 
appreciated.[163,176] From a recipient’s view, this phenomenon 
occurring in the organ of another person may rather be 
called de novo isoimmunity. Increasing experimental and 
clinical evidence suggests that Th17 immunity, already 
known to contribute to development of both autoimmune 
diseases and acute allograft rejection, plays a critical role 
in CAD,[112,163,176] but, notably, is resistant to CNI‑based im‑
munosuppression.[177]
Th17 immunity‑mediated injury appears to be predomi‑
nantly conveyed via secretion of cytokines including IL‑17A, 
IL‑17F, IL‑21, and IL‑22, which contribute to recruitment 
of immune cells, in particular, neutrophils, to sites of injury 
and lead to induction of DAMPs which, in turn, may activate 
innate immune cells such as DCs, fibroblasts, epithelial cells, 
and vascular cells. In addition, IL‑17, in coordination with 
IL‑21 and B cell activating factor of the TNF family (BAFF), 
promotes germinal center formation and influences B cells to 
produce pathogenic antibodies,[112,178] a process that may add 
further injury to an allograft [Figure 8]. Most important, how‑
ever, the secretion of IL‑17 may lead to allofibrosis via con‑
tribution to the innate IL‑1β → IL‑23 → IL‑17A ↔TGF‑β1 
cytokine axis mentioned above [Figure 7].
As reviewed,[118] PRRs expressed by DCs including 
TLRs and NLRs are essential to sense Th17‑instructive 
DAMPs. These DAMPs, as demonstrated for HMGB1, may 
be induced by allograft injuries, in particular, by previous 
Th1 alloimmune response‑mediated injury.[169,179] Further, 
cytokine receptors and other immunomodulatory receptors 
also contribute to DC‑mediated Th17 cell differentiation by 
affecting the production of Th17‑polarizing cytokines.[118]
As also reviewed,[118] activation of NLPR3‑mediated in‑
flammasome has been shown to promote Th17 cell differ‑
entiation in autoimmune and inflammatory models. This 
is mechanistically believed to be linked to the requirement 
of NLRP3 to promote IL‑1β and IL‑18 production from 
DCs for the potentiation of Th17 responses. These findings 
indicate that diverse recognition receptors in DCs triggered 
by certain selected DAMPs, including “NLRP3 inflamma‑
some‑activating” DAMPs such as adenosine released from 
injured graft cells,[180] translate inflammatory mediators and 
environmental signals into proper Th17 cell generation.
Interestingly, Th17 immunity appears to be mainly 
directed against non‑human leukocyte antigens(non‑HLA) 
rather than against MHC/HLA alloantigens. In fact, a num‑
ber of altered‑self tissue antigens have emerged as targets of 
isoimmune responses after transplantation and vary depend‑
ing on the transplanted organ. These isoantigens that are 
presented to naïve T cells by recipient DCs via the indirect 
pathway of allorecognition can be regarded as the result 
of intermolecular epitope spreading (in terms of allograft 
injury‑induced exposure of “cryptic self–antigens”) that 
was also demonstrated during chronic allograft rejection.[181]
These tissue‑specific isoantigens reportedly involved in 
CAD include cardiac myosin, HSPs, vimentin, collagen 
type V, and K‑α1 tubulin.[164,176] Remarkably, clinical stud‑
ies in recipients with cardiac allograft vasculopathy already 
demonstrated that Th17 cells specific to myosin, vimentin, 
Col‑V, and K‑α1T are involved in CAD.[164,182]
Chronic antigen‑independent injuries
Hypertension
In a state of chronic hypertension that itself is sup‑
posed to originate from primary innate/adaptive immune 
responses,[183] the vessel wall is permanently injured, pre‑
dominantly mediated by increased hemodynamic forces, that 
is, increased shear stress associated with oxidative stress and 
pathological stretch determined by luminal pressure.[184,185] In 
turn, mechanical and oxidative stress in the vasculature may 
lead to the induction of DAMPs which initiate innate fibro‑
genic pathways and thereby promote atherogenesis.[131,183,186]
For example, in studies on in vitro stretching models of 
pulmonary epithelial cells and aortic smooth muscle cells, 
the stretch forces were shown to lead the DAMPs, HMGB1 
and oxLDL.[187,188] In addition, as shown in an experimental 
system consisting of rat arterial endothelial sheets exposed 
to tensile stretch stress, the expression of the endothelial 
DAMP, HSP70, was markedly up‑regulated.[189] In other 
lines of studies, the DAMP, HMGB1, was found to play a 
role in the pathogenesis of hypertension.[190,191] On the other 
hand, hypertension/mechanical stress‑induced PRRs such as 
TLR2, TLR4, and RAGE, known to recognize mechanical 
stress‑induced DAMPs, have also been demonstrated to be 
involved in atherogenesis [Figure 4].[131,192‑195]

Biomed J Vol. 36 No. 5
September - October 2013
Of note, hypertension may also contribute to inter‑
stitial fibrogenesis as documented in experimental and 
clinical studies.[196‑198] Modern notions about potential 
hypertension‑induced fibrogenesis include the discussion 
about mechanisms resulting in tissue hypoxia that, in turn, 
induced fibrosis. In renal fibrosis, for example, such mecha‑
nisms include hypertension‑associated decreased renal 
blood flow due to increased vascular tone which is induced 
by angiotensin II that limits oxygen delivery. Notably, this 
process is associated with hypoxia and increases oxidative 
stress. Once fibrosis has developed, a vicious circle may 
be generated relating tubule‑interstitial fibrosis to chronic 
hypoxia, which creates a self‑sustaining mechanism that 
accelerates the fibrogenic process.[199]
Dyslipidemia
Lipid abnormalities are a common complication of 
transplantation, occurring in up to 60% of kidney trans‑
planted patients.[200] Following transplantation, lipid dis‑
turbances may show a different profile due to the various 
effects of immunosuppressive drugs on lipid metabolism. 
Accordingly, steroids, CNIs, and mammalian target of 
rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors usually lead to quantitative 
and qualitative abnormalities of very low‑density, low‑den‑
sity, and high‑density lipoproteins. These proatherogenic 
lipid abnormalities (e.g., cholesterolemia), if suboptimally 
treated, may lead to cardiovascular complications as one of 
the leading causes of death in transplant recipients and, in 
addition, may promote CAD via contribution to alloathero‑
sclerosis [Figures 3 and 4].
As outlined in more detail above,[16,28‑47] oxidized lipids 
such as oxLDL enriched in dyslipidemia may contribute 
to atherogenesis/alloatherogenesis via activation of innate 
immune pathways resulting in creation of arterial wall 
inflammation.
Organotoxic drugs
Organotoxic (e.g., nephrotoxic) and atherogenic im‑
munosuppressive agents such as CNIs contribute to the 
development of CAD. There are numerous reports in the 
literature from experiments clearly showing an atherogenic 
effect of cyclosporine A (CsA), as indicated by induction 
of endothelial dysfunction, EC injury, and arteritis. As 
reviewed elsewhere,[201,202] CsA can induce the generation 
of ROS (in particular, free hydroxyl radicals in kidneys of 
CsA‑treated rats) and HSPs induced by ROS, respectively. 
In regard to CsA‑mediated renal fibrosis, targeted studies 
revealed that the proximal tubular epithelial cells themselves 
are direct targets for CsA‑induced injury.[203] As a matter of 
fact, evidence was provided suggesting that CsA can cause 
an EMT‑like event in human renal epithelial cells.[204]
On the other hand, there is accumulating evidence 
suggesting that CNI‑induced chronic global injury to renal 
allografts activates cells of innate immunity (i.e., vascular 
cells, epithelial cells, and fibroblasts/myofibroblasts) via 
chronic oxidative stress. In this scenario, ROS‑induced 
DAMPs such as HSPs may operate as endogenous ligands 
of PRR‑bearing renal cells, a notion that has experimentally 
been confirmed.[205‑207]
Taken together, and in view of these experimental 
data, one may discuss that long‑term application of CNIs 
in kidney transplant patients accelerates the process of 
chronic allograft nephropathy via innate immune‑mediated 
alloatherogenesis and allofibrogenesis.
Infection‑mediated allograft injuries
Certain infectious diseases in transplant patients appear 
to be associated with CAD. In kidney transplant patients, this 
group preferentially includes urinary tract bacterial infections 
as well as nephropathy due to BK polyoma virus infection 
which activates the innate immune defense system through 
TLR3, contributing to intrarenal antiviral and anti‑inflamma‑
tory responses.[208‑210] On the other hand, there is a considerable 
number of different infectious agents that have been linked 
with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, including 
C. pneumonia, influenza A virus, HCV, and CMV.[211,212] As 
documented, C. pneumonia, CMV, and HCV infections have 
been identified as the risk factors for CAD.[213‑215]
In regard to the underlying mechanisms of how a patho‑
gen may contribute to alloatherogenesis or allofibrogenesis, 
a role for a direct pathogenic cytotoxic effect and an indi‑
rectly mediated effect via an anti‑pathogen innate immune 
response eventually associated with collateral allograft 
damage, respectively, may be causative, as also discussed 
elsewhere.[210‑212] Another mechanism currently discussed 
refers to the possibility that infectious pathogens, via as‑
sociated tissue injury, may lead to the induction of DAMPs 
which, in turn, result in an innate/adaptive immune response 
against host tissue, here the allograft [Figure 2].[13,14]
Outlook
As already proposed by us two decades ago,[7,8] convinc‑
ing evidence has now accumulated in support of the notion 
that CAD results from multiple acute and/or persistently/
repetitively chronic injuries to an allograft. Such injuries 
arepredominantly caused by (1) an adaptive Th1 alloim‑
mune response and, as increasingly appreciated, an adaptive 
Th17 isoimmune response, as well as (2) nonimmune anti‑
gen‑independent attacks and (3) infection‑mediated insults 
that may accelerate progression of dysfunction. Over time, 
exposure of an allograft to those various injurious attacks, 
in particular, when repeatedly occurring, leads – or at least 
contributes – to both progressive loss of functioning paren‑
chymal cells and innate immunity/inflammation‑mediated 
fibrosing processes of the (micro) vasculature and intersti‑
tium which, in turn, contribute to further loss of parenchymal

cells. The NLRP3 inflammasome appears to play a dominant 
role in fibrogenesis, but other inflammasomes such as the 
AIM2 inflammasome may also contribute.
Emerging concepts of how to interfere with (1) those 
different injuries, (2) generation of DAMPs, and (3) subse‑
quent PRR‑mediated signaling pathways leading to fibrosis 
should guide us to innovative therapeutic approaches to 
tackle specifically this cardinal clinical problem in trans‑
plantation medicine. Certainly, various concepts can be 
considered. With respect to resistance of Th17 immunity 
to nephrotoxic CNIs,[177] one example out of – quite admit‑
tedly – many potential strategies would refer to prophylactic 
treatment of infections in transplant patients (such as CMV 
or BK polyoma virus infection) with intravenous hyperim‑
mune or standard immunoglobulin G preparations because, 
besides their antiviral properties, these biologicals exert im‑
munosuppressive potency,[216] induce Tregs via “Tregitopes” 
on DCs,[217] and, importantly, have recently been shown to 
inhibit IL‑17 production by Th17 cells involved in CAD.[218]
