The objective of this study was to identify possible predisposing factors for candiduria in intensive care unit
(ICU) patients from Hospital das Clínicas, Universidade Federal de Goiás, Goiânia, Brazil, during one year. Urine
samples from 153 ICU patients were obtained by catheterization on admission day and every seven days. Data such
as sex, age, antifungal therapy, and variables as antibiotics, underlying diseases or comorbid conditions and stay
in the hospital, were collected from patients who had at least one urine culture that yielded ≥ 103 yeast colonies/ml.
Candiduria was recovered in 68 patients and the commonest predisposing factors were antibiotic therapy (100%)
and indwelling urinary catheter (92.6%). The percentage of Candida spp. isolation increased during the extended
periods in which patients remained in the ICU. C. albicans was isolated in 69.1%, and the other species non-albicans
as C. glabrata, C. kefyr, C. parapsilosis, C. famata, C. guilliermondii, C. krusei, and C. tropicalis were isolated in lower
percentage. The high frequency of candiduria and the possible predisposing factors found in ICU patients show that
candiduria surveillance should be performed to help reducing nosocomial infections.

Although an increase of candiduria among hospital￾ized patients has been reported, the significance of the
presence of yeasts in the urine of patients is not clearly
understood (Weber et al. 1992, Nucci 2000). A common
clinical problem is to deciding whether candiduria repre￾sents urinary tract infections or merely bladder coloniza￾tion or contamination (Akalm et al. 2004). Distinguishing
contamination from true infection is not easy, despite the
existence of reliable diagnostic criteria for significant
candiduria (Sobel 2002). It has been observed that noso￾comial urinary tract infections have increased in the two
last decades, probably due to many predisposing factors
associated with occurrence of candiduria (Sobel 2002).
Several risk factors such as use of indwelling urinary
devices, diabetes mellitus, antibiotic use, immunosuppres￾sive therapy, extended hospitalization, extremes of age
and female sex have been identified as associated with
increase of Candida growth in urine (Sobel 2002). Al￾though, non-albicans species as C. tropicalis and C.
glabrata have been frequently found in this clinical speci￾men, C. albicans is still the most frequent yeast recov￾ered from urine cultures (Nucci 2000).
The objective of this study was to identify possible
candiduria factors predisposing in intensive care unit (ICU)
patients from Hospital das Clínicas, Universidade Federal
de Goiás, Goiânia, Brazil, during one year.

PATIENTS AND METHODS
Population studied - Urine samples from 153 ICU pa￾tients of the Hospital das Clínicas, Universidade Federal
de Goiás, state of Goiás, Brazil, were obtained by cath￾eterization in the admission day and every seven days in
the ICU. All participants provided informed consent be￾fore enrollment and the study was approved by the Ethics
Committee of the Hospital das Clínicas. Data such as sex,
age, and variables as possible predisposing factors, in￾cluding antibiotics, underlying diseases or comorbid con￾ditions and stay in the hospital, were collected from pa￾tients who had at least one urine culture that yielded ≥ 103
yeast colonies/ml.
Culture methods and quantitative culture methods -
The urine samples were spread by calibrated loop (0.01 ml)
onto Sabouraud dextrose agar plates supplemented with
100 µg/ml of chloramphenicol. Plates were incubated aero￾bically at 37ºC and read within 24 h. The detection level for
quantitative cultures used in this study was 100 CFU/ml,
represented by a single colony of yeast on a plate (Koneman
et al. 1997). Candida species were identified by germ tube
formation in fetal calf serum at 37ºC, colony morphology on
cornmeal agar and sugar fermentation and assimilation tests
(Kurtzman & Fell 1998). Identification was confirmed by
API 20C Aux System for yeasts (bioMerieux, Marcy L’ Etoile,
France). C. albicans ATCC 10231 and C. parapsilosis 22019
were included as control.
Statistical methods - All statistical analysis were per￾formed using Statistical Programmer for Social Sciences
(SPSS) 11.0 for Windows. The regression linear analysis
was used to determine if the time of hospital permanence
increased Candida colonization in ICU patients’ urine.
Chi-square was used to test the correlation of candiduria
and women. P values were significant when ≤ 0.05.

RESULTS
Of the patients studied, 80 were males and 73 were
females. The mean age was 53 ± 19 years. Among the 153
urine samples cultured, candiduria was recovered in 68
patients. The commonest coexisting exposures in patients
with candiduria were antibiotic therapy (100%) and ind￾welling urinary catheter (92.6%). It was verified that the
presence of Candida in the urine was higher in women
than in men (p = 0.001). The vast majority of the patients
(80.9%) had three invasive simultaneously procedures.
Underlying conditions as anemia and malnutrition were
present in 32.3 and 4.41% of the patients, respectively

68), followed by C. glabrata, isolated in 7.4% (5/68). This
later species was isolated in four women (80%).
During the period under study, 25 patients developed
candiduria in the ICU. The percentage of Candida sp.,
isolation increased during the extended period in which
patients remained in the ICU. We observed a linear trend
towards increasing numbers of Candida positive cultures;
this increase was statistically significant (p = 0.001). Data
about candiduria etiology at hospital admission and ev￾ery 7 days are shown in Table II.
DISCUSSION
Fungal nosocomial infection has become an impor￾tant problem on the past decade (Oravcova et al. 1996). In
the present study, candiduria was detected in 44.4% (68/
153) of the ICU patients. This high incidence of funguria
in this unit should be considered very important. Accord￾ing to some authors, presence of funguria in those pa￾tients might be indicative of urinary tract or systemic in￾fection (Nassoura et al. 1993).
Although C. albicans has been the commonest etio￾logic agent, non-albicans species were isolated in 31.9%
of the urine samples. The emergence of non-albicans
species may represent selection of less susceptible spe￾cies by antifungal agents as fluconazole in particular. Some
Candida strains as C. glabrata and C. krusei are less
susceptible to fluconazole than C. albicans (Morace et
al. 1991, Hoppe et al. 1994, Nenoff et al. 1999). Similar
results about emerging species occurrence have been
observed in hospitalized patients (Rezende et al. 2002).
Many risk factors may favor or contribute to patient
colonization. Some investigators have showed that use
of antibiotics, presence of central venous catheter, and
prolonged hospital permanence represent important risk
factors for the development of microorganisms (Kauffman
et al. 2000, Blumberg et al. 2001, Simpson et al. 2004). We
verified in our work that all patients were under antibiotic
use (100%). These drugs play a critical role in the patho￾genesis of candiduria, which emerges during antibiotic
therapy or immediately after it. By suppressing suscep￾tible endogenous bacterial flora in the gastrointestinal
and lower genital tracts, antibiotic favors epithelial sur￾TABLE I

was verified that urine culture was positive in 43 patients
in the admission day and in 25 patients the detection of
yeasts occurred in 8 to 42 days (mean 10.4 ± 12.3) of hos￾pital permanence. Candiduria persisted in 21 patients. In
45 patients new urine sample were not collected because
of death (24 patients) or transfer to another extended care
facility (21 patients). The predominant species were C.

face fungal colonization, with ready access to the urinary
tract, specially in the presence of indwelling bladder cath￾eter (Fisher et al. 1982, Sobel & Vazquez 1999).
This study showed that in most cases of candiduria
the patient had a urinary catheter (92.6%). Similar results
have been obtained by Kobayashi et al. (2004), who veri￾fied that 84.4% of the patients with candiduria had a cath￾eter. According to Klotz and Smith (1990), yeasts are able
to adhere to the catheter, allowing colonization in this
device. Although infection by yeasts in patients with in￾dwelling urinary catheter has not been well defined till
now, use of invasive procedures has been reported as an
important factor for development of Candida spp. infec￾tion (Álvarez-Lerma et al. 2003).
Interestingly, candiduria was higherin females (61.6%)
than in males (p = 0.001). This incidence in females may
reflect vaginal candidiasis. Yeasts may ascend from the
genital tract to the urinary tract, explaining a higher
candiduria incidence in women. This hypothesis was sug￾gested by Febré et al. (1999), who found five of eight
patients with positive vaginal secretions and later showed
the presence of the same yeast species in their urine. C.
glabrata, described as etiologic agent of vaginal candidi￾asis in several cases (Del Palacio et al. 2000), was recov￾ered in our study in five patients, among whom four were
women.
Consistent with the observations of other investiga￾tors (Ahmad et al. 2003, Álvarez-Lerma et al. 2003), we
found that patients with ICU stay > 1 week had higher
urine Candida colonization than in the admission day.
According to some researchers most of the probable
sources of nosocomial acquisition in ICU appear to be
originated endogenously, but there is also evidence that
exogenous infection or cross-infection from nursing staff
may occur (Ahmad et al. 2003, Khan et al. 2003). It is evi￾dent that the risk factors should be considered for acqui￾sition of Candida in urine. The acquisition source was
not investigated in our study.
Although previous studies indicate that asymptom￾atic candiduria is usually benign, even in debilitated pa￾tients, and eradication of funguria without use of specific
antifungal agents has been verified, candiduria should
never be ignored, since this condition may be the only
(and is often the first) indication of systemic or invasive
candidiasis (Sobel 1999). Ahmad et al. (2003) observed
that two C. albicans isolates from candidemia patients
were similar to those from their urine and oral isolates,
analyzed by random amplification of polymorphic DNA,
reinforcing the point of view that prior colonization is a
risk factor. Then, candiduria surveillance should be per￾formed to help reducing nosocomial infections. In con￾clusion, in our study we verified a high frequency of
candiduria in patients from ICU, and the permanence in
hospital was an important factor for acquisition of Can￾dida.
