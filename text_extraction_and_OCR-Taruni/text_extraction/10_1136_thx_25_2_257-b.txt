Various techniques have-been tried to allow easy
lengthening of the electrode wire. These include:
1. Leaving a loop of wire in the heart (in two out of
three the electrode tip displaced);
2. Manually feeding more wire into the vein from spare
loops retained in a subcutaneous nylon sleeve;
3. Initial suturing of the electrode tip to the endocar￾dium, allowing spontaneous feeding of excess wire from
a nylon bag into the vein, as the electrode straightens
with growth.
Endocardial pacing seems a feasible long-term
approach in children.
A DECADE OF THORACIC PAPERS
A. JOHN ROBERTSON During the last 10 years, over 700
papers have been received by the medical editor of
Thorax. About 53% of these have been from the
United Kingdom and 45% from 40 different overseas
countries. About 40% of all papers were rejected, the
acceptance rate being 64 % from Great Britain and 56 %
from elsewhere. The countries with the highest accept￾ance rate were New Zealand and Australia: some
examples of percentages from other places are shown,
as well as some reasons for rejection. In 1960 the
journal contained 360 pages, but in 1970, 768 pages are
scheduled. The change in subject matter is briefly
discussed, as well as methods of assessing and editing
papers.
BUSULPHAN LUNG
Clinical Features
W. A. LIT'LER Diffuse pulmonary fibrosis is now a
recognized complication of busulphan therapy. Heard
and Cooke (1968) examined the lungs of 14 patients
dying of chronic myeloid leukaemia and found histo￾logical changes attributable to busulphan in six, but in
only one of these had busulphan lung been suspected
during life. This high incidence of busulphan lung at
necropsy has prompted a prospective study to discover
whether the condition can be detected earlier by means
of serial clinical, radiographic and physiological exam￾inations. The methods employed in this study and the
preliminary findings are reported along with details of
the first patient from the series in whom busulphan lung
was diagnosed during life and confirmed at necropsy.
This patient was a man of 61 years with chronic myeloid
leukaemia treated over a period of 19 months with a total
dose of 1,000 mg. busulphan. Evidence of pulmonary
disease did not arise until one month after withdrawal
of busulphan, and consisted of intense dyspnoea, a dry
cough, central cyanosis and persistent crepitations at the
lung bases. The chest radiograph showed a progressive
diffuse mottling throughout both lungs and physiological
tests demonstrated a restrictive ventilatory defect asso￾ciated with a gas transfer factor of only 25% of the
predicted normal. The pulmonary condition progressed
to a fatal termination within three months of its onset
despite the fact that busulphan had been withheld and
large doses of prednisone given.
Histopathology
P. S. HASLETON Patients treated with busulphan may
develop characteristic cellular and fibrous changes in
their lungs. The alveoli are lined by large cells with big
nuclei and copious cytoplasm which contains clear bodies
resembling vacuoles. The cells desquamate into the
alveolar spaces and disintegrate to form an amorphous
eosinophilic debris. The identification of these cells and
the ultrastructure of the debris are described in the
following paper. The alveolar walls become thickened
by chronic oedema and then interstitial fibrosis. Organ￾ization of the intra-alveolar debris also occurs. In the
case described pulmonary cholesterol-ester granulomas
were also present. They consisted of fibrous nodules
around acicular cholesterol clefts with a surrounding
chronic inflammatory exudate. The hypothesis is
advanced that such granulomas are associated more with
hyperplasia of granular pneumocytes than with pulmon￾ary hypertension.
Electron Microscopy
J. M. KAY Electron microscopy was carried out to
identify the large alveolar cells and to determine the
nature of the intra-alveolar debris which characterize
the histological picture of this condition. The enlarged
alveolar cells had the ultrastructural features of granular
(type II) pneumocytes. They possessed prominent
intracytoplasmic lamellar secretory inclusions (lamellar
bodies), and their free borders showed numerous irreg￾ular, short microvilli. The intra-alveolar debris con￾sisted of strands of amorphous electron-dense fibrillary
material interspersed with roughly circular bodies
composed of concentric electron-dense membranes. The
fibrillary material resembled fibrin and the circular bodies
appeared identical to the lamellar secretory inclusion
bodies of granular pneumocytes. In some instances, it
appeared that granular pneumocytes had disintegrated
and liberated their lamellar bodies, which had given rise
to the intra-alveolar debris. Also scattered within the
alveolar spaces were myelin figures which resembled
phospholipid membranes. Evidence of organization of
the intra-alveolar debris was seen in the form of groups
of fibrils showing the characteristic periodic transverse
striation of collagen.
PROSTHETIC TRACHEAL REPLACEMENT
JOHN BORRIE The principles governing successful
tracheal reconstruction are reviewed. Over a 15-year
experimental experience of reconstructing long tracheal
defects (5 cm. or more), the methods of suturing alone,
suturing with lateral relieving incisions, the use of ribbed
Dacron prostheses, Marlex mesh, and one form of
Silastic prosthesis have all been tried and rejected. More
promising rasults from current research methods are
shown.
