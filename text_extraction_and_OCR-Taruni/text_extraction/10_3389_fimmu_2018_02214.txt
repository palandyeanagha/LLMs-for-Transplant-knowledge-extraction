Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is under constant selective pressure from the immune
system in vivo. Study of HCMV genes that have been lost in the absence of, or genetically
altered by, such selection can focus research toward findings of in vivo significance. We
have been particularly interested in the most pronounced change in the highly passaged
laboratory strains AD169 and Towne—the deletion of 13–15 kb of sequence (designated
the UL/b′
region) that encodes up to 22 canonical genes, UL133-UL150. At least 5
genes have been identified in UL/b′
that inhibit NK cell function. UL135 suppresses
formation of the immunological synapse (IS) by remodeling the actin cytoskeleton,
thereby illustrating target cell cooperation in IS formation. UL141 inhibits expression of
two activating ligands (CD155, CD112) for the activating receptor CD226 (DNAM-1),
and two receptors (TRAIL-R1, R2) for the apoptosis-inducing TRAIL. UL142, ectopically
expressed in isolation, and UL148A, target specific MICA allotypes that are ligands for
NKG2D. UL148 impairs expression of CD58 (LFA-3), the co-stimulatory cell adhesion
molecule for CD2 found on T and NK cells. Outside UL/b′
, studies on natural variants have
shown UL18 mutants change affinity for their inhibitory ligand LIR-1, while mutations in
UL40’s HLA-E binding peptide differentially drive NKG2C+ NK expansions. Research into
HCMV genomic stability and its effect on NK function has provided important insights into
virus:host interactions, but future studies will require consideration of genetic variability
and the effect of genes expressed in the context of infection to fully understand their
in vivo impact.

INTRODUCTION
Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a persistent infection that rarely causes serious clinical
symptoms in healthy adults, but opportunistically induces life-threatening disease with long-term
sequalae in the immune compromised such as transplant recipients, AIDS patients and following
infection of the fetus. NK cells play a critical role in preventing HCMV disease, as evidenced
by serious complications due to HCMV infection in individuals with NK cell deficiency (1, 2).
This has driven extensive research into the interaction between NK cells and HCMV, revealing a
steadily increasing number of viral-encoded immunomodulatory functions. However, relating in
vitro function to in vivo significance remains difficult, not least due to the necessary caution in
interpreting data from experiments using different HCMV strains, many of which do not encode a
wildtype complement of viral genes (3).

Patel et al. Genetic Variation and HCMV-Encoded NK Modulators
Like many viruses, rapid selection of mutants can occur
when HCMV is placed under selective pressure. In vivo, there is
pressure to retain immunomodulatory functions due to selection
from the host immune system, yet this is not the case in vitro.
Only 26% (45 of 171) of the canonical HCMV genes are necessary
for replication in vitro (4, 5), and selection of mutants lacking
genes that are either not required, or are inhibitory, in vitro,
occurs within a few weeks of isolation, becoming more extensive
as passage continues (6–9). Ultimately numerous mutations can
be seen, including large deletions such as the 13–15 kb UL/b
′
region, UL133-UL150, that has been lost from the widely used
AD169 and Towne strains (7, 10). Not only does this progressive
loss of genetic material mean laboratories are forced to work with
strains lacking many genes that are relevant to understanding
the interaction of the virus with the host, but the “same” virus
in different laboratories may produce differing phenotypes as a
result of it encoding a different repertoire of genes, such as the
multiple genetic variants of AD169 and Towne (7). An example
of an incorrect conclusion resulting from use of a passaged strain
is the initial description of HCMV-induced upregulation of CD58
(11), when wildtype viruses actually impair expression (12).
Therefore, to understand pathogenicity in vivo, the use of
strains encoding the complete repertoire of HCMV genes is
desirable. We and others have endeavored to meet this need
by generating infectious bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs)
containing cloned HCMV genomes (3). BACs enable a HCMV
genome to be stably maintained in E. coli, without the risk of
selection of mutants as occurs during mammalian cell passage.
Virus can then be repeatedly re-derived from a consistent genetic
starting point. Furthermore, techniques such as recombineering
or en-passant mutagenesis can be used to rapidly modify the
cloned genome (13, 14). This has resulted in the generation
of numerous BAC cloned HCMV strains. Unfortunately, to
accommodate BAC sequences, many of the initially created BACs
contained deletions in the US2-6 region (3), within which there
are genes that downregulate HLA-I from the cell surface, as well
as genes that act as hubs for degradation of multiple additional
host proteins. The higher HLA-I levels affect readouts of NK
and T-cell activation, while the loss of US2 affects cell migration,
adhesion, and NK cell interactions (15). Furthermore, when
these BACs are transfected to recover virus, additional mutations
can occur around the BAC cassette, and in the UL/b′
region
(16). Taken together, these issues mean that NK assays using
viruses derived from these early BACs need to be interpreted with
caution.
More recently, versions of some of these BACs have
been produced in which the deleted sequences from the US
region have been re-inserted, and the BAC cassette excised to
accommodate the additional material (17–19). These strains
provide a convenient reagent, nevertheless, results from them
still need to be interpreted with caution as most lack UL141, a
major NK regulator, and carry mutations in two genes (RL13
and UL128), that significantly affect tropism and virus growth
properties (20). Furthermore, the original clinical material is
not available, making it impossible to know whether additional
in vitro acquired mutations are present. Such mutations can be
as subtle as a change in a splice site (20), or an amino acid
alteration (21), yet can have significant impacts on virus:host
interactions (3).
Our BAC of choice currently is therefore Merlin, which was
isolated from the urine of a congenitally infected child, and
cloned into a BAC as a full-length genome (9). BAC sequences
were also excised from derived viruses, ensuring that they do
not drive the selection of mutations (16). Comparison of the
BAC sequence to the sequence of the virus found in the original
clinical sample revealed in vitro acquired mutations in two genes,
UL128 and RL13, which were then repaired. This generated the
only BAC to date that contains a full length HCMV genome
that matches the original clinical sample, and encodes the
complete repertoire of wildtype HCMV genes (9). Further work
enabled Merlin containing a full-length genome to be passaged
in vitro without selection of mutants (16). Interestingly, unlike
passaged HCMV strains, viruses derived from this BAC (i.e.,
containing RL13 and UL128) do not release substantial amounts
of infectious cell-free virus, instead spreading predominantly
by the cell-cell route. This is consistent with observations that
clinical viruses do not release high levels of cell free virus
in vivo or in vitro (6, 9, 22). This distinction is important for
understanding HCMV’s in vivo interactions with the immune
system, as firstly, cell-cell spread is more resistant to elements of
innate and intrinsic immunity; secondly, cell-cell spread is more
resistant to neutralizing antibodies than cell-free spread; and
finally, cell-cell spread enables highly efficient transfer of wildtype
virus into a wide range of cell types, including macrophages,
dendritic cells, endothelial cells and epithelial cells that are
infected by HCMV in vivo (22).
These reagents have allowed us and others to study gene
function in the context of HCMV infection on a stable,
close-to-wildtype, genetic background. However, the loss of
functions from passaged “laboratory” strains still serves a
useful role, in that it can focus research on genetic regions
that contain proteins encoding accessory functions that are
selected for in vivo, such as those involved in responding to
the immune system. In this context, studies comparing the
host response to strains containing an intact UL/b′
region
with those lacking this region showed significant differences,
correlating loss of UL/b′ with reduced pathogenicity following
in vivo challenge (23, 24), as well as greatly enhanced sensitivity
to NK cell killing (25–27). Subsequent work has identified a
range of immunomodulatory functions in the UL/b′
region,
with this review detailing those that specifically target NK
cells, and discussing the novel aspects of NK biology that
study of the UL/b′
region has revealed. In addition to
alterations in NK modulators occurring due to selection in
vitro, NK modulatory genes outside the UL/b′
region have also
undergone selection in vivo to give rise to genetic variation.
We therefore finish with a discussion of recent research
into this selection, highlighting how important HCMV:host
interactions are defined by their impact on the phenotype of
NK cells following exposure to HCMV. The different HCMV￾encoded NK evasins described in this review are summarized in
Figure 1.

NK Cell Modulators Lost From HCMV
in Cell Culture
Targeting of Ligands for DNAM-1 and TRAIL-Rs
by UL141
The first HCMV UL/b′
gene to be designated an NK cell evasion
was UL141, and occurred prior to the development of BAC
technology. Use of a recombinant HCMV consisting of Towne
and the UL/b′
region from Toledo revealed that transferring the
UL/b′
region conferred resistance to NK cell killing. UL141 was
then identified as one of the genes responsible for this phenotype,
by screening individual Toledo UL/b′
genes, ectopically expressed
from replication-deficient adenoviruses (rAds). The cellular
protein targeted by UL141 to achieve this effect was identified
through an extensive screen of known NK cell activating ligands
on the surface of rAdUL141-infected cells. Surface expression
of CD155 (poliovirus receptor/nectin-like molecule 5), a protein
normally involved in formation of stromal cell-cell junctions (28)
and an activating ligand for DNAM-1 (CD226) and CD96 on NK
cells (29, 30), is impaired by its binding and sequestration inside
the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by UL141. Demonstration of
UL141 function in the context of infection was achieved through
subcloning a HCMV1UL141 strain from TB40/E (27).
CD112 (nectin-2), another ligand for DNAM-1 (29), is also
downregulated upon HCMV infection and rescued by deletion of
UL141 from Merlin, albeit by a distinct mechanism (31). In this
case, UL141 acts in concert with a second HCMV gene outside
the UL/b′
region. Plasma membrane profiling of cells infected
with HCMVs lacking each of the HLA-I downregulating genes
(US2, US3, US6, and US11) revealed that UL141 co-operates
with US2 to degrade CD112 in a TRC8-dependent manner, the
same mechanism by which US2 induces HLA-I heavy chain
proteasomal degradation (15).
Two further host proteins impacting on NK function have
been identified that are modified by UL141. TNF-related
apoptosis inducing ligand receptors 1 and 2 (TRAIL-R1 and
R2) are able to transmit apoptotic signals to the cell through
adapter molecules leading to caspase activation following ligation
by their ligand, TRAIL/Apo2L (32). UL141 is responsible for
downregulation of both TRAIL-R1 and R2 during HCMV
infection, also through retention in the ER (33, 34). Apoptosis
assays demonstrated that overexpression of UL141 through rAds
protected, while cells infected with HCMV1UL141 on a strain
FIX background were more susceptible, to TRAIL-dependent NK
cell killing (34). Thus, UL141 is remarkable in that it prevents NK
cell mediated cytotoxicity by targeting at least 4 different proteins
using two independent mechanisms of intracellular retention
and proteasomal degradation. Three separate background strains
(TB40/E, Merlin and FIX) were used to generate HCMV1UL141
viruses in these studies.
Targeting of MICA by UL142 and UL148A
Interest in UL142 was driven by the prediction that it had
homology to HLA-I following analysis of UL142 sequences from
high and low passage HCMV strains with ORF prediction tools.
Cells which ectopically expressed UL142 were more resistant
to NK cell mediated killing (35). This was achieved through
downregulation and sequestration into the cis-Golgi of MHC￾I related protein A (MICA) (36, 37), one of the ligands
for the activating receptor Natural-killer group 2, member D
(NKG2D) found on T and NK cells. UL142 is polymorphic
in clinical HCMV isolates (36), and it was proposed that
this is to accommodate for diversity in MIC alleles. Indeed,
MICA∗
008, which is the most common MICA allele, and
lacks a cytoplasmic tail due to a premature stop codon, is
resistant to UL142 mediated downregulation (36, 38). Instead,
US9 specifically targets MICA∗
008 for proteasomal degradation,
without affecting other MICA or HLA-I-like molecules. Here
HCMV1US9 was generated on an AD169VarL background
missing UL140-UL144 rather than the whole UL/b′
region (39).
Downregulation of MICA has also been mapped to UL148A (40),
as well as genes in the US18-22 region of the Merlin genome
(41). UL148A was identified using HCMV knock-out viruses on
an AD169VarL background, and requires an as-yet unidentified
additional HCMV gene to function (40). Interestingly, proteomic
analysis comparing the impact of AD169 (lacking UL148A and
the rest of the UL/b′
region) and Merlin infection on fibroblasts
did not show differential effects on MICA (42), suggesting the
potential for strain-specific interactions between this region and
the host. Deletion of US18 and US20 individually and together
indicated that these two genes act synergistically to inhibit MICA

expression (41). UL148A, US18, and US20 all traffic MICA to the
lysosome for degradation. Multiplexed proteomic analysis of the
same gene region revealed that US18 and US20 also impair NK
recognition by targeting the NKp30 ligand B7-H6, underscoring
the ability of viral immune-evasions to modulate multiple cellular
pathways simultaneously (43, 44).
Disruption of the Actin Cytoskeleton by UL135
A systematic screen of genes in the UL/b′
region using ectopic
expression by rAds showed that UL135 also impaired the
degranulation of both NK and T cells (45). Compared with
Merlin, cells infected with Merlin1UL135 were less rounded
when assessed by microscopy, implying that UL135 had an
important role in the characteristic cytopathic effect induced
by HCMV. In support of this, Merlin1UL135-infected cells
did not exhibit loss of F-actin from the center of the cell
that is normally observed following HCMV infection. Using
yeast-2-hybrid and Stable Isotope Labeling with Amino acids in
Cell culture combined with immunoprecipitation (SILAC-IP),
UL135 was found to interact directly with AB1/AB2, and via
these, relocated the entire WAVE2 regulatory complex (WRC;
including ABI1, ABI2, NAP1, CYFIP1, WAVE2). Importantly,
the WRC is responsible for regulating the actin nucleator Arp2/3
(46). The interaction with the WRC was critical for both the
UL135-mediated cytopathic effect, and immune evasion, when
assessed by NK cell degranulation and adhesion. Furthermore,
imaging revealed a correlation between the presence of actin
fibers in the target cell, with the structure of the immune synapse
formed with NK cells. When F-actin fibers in the target cell
were disrupted by UL135 expression, the ability of the NK cell
to form an immune synapse was impaired. Thus it appears that
in addition to well recognized structural requirements in the
effector cell, physical structures in the target cell are also required
for the formation of effective immunological synapses, and this
requirement is targeted by HCMV to mediate immune-evasion
(45).
Suppression of Co-stimulation by UL148
CD2 is an important co-stimulatory molecule found on the
surface of T and NK cells and binds to CD58 (LFA-3) on
the surface of antigen presenting cells (47). Recent work has
identified the role of CD58:CD2 signaling as important for
adaptive NK cell activity, regulating cell adhesion and the
formation of the immunological synapse (48). Early research
showed that CD58 was upregulated on the surface of HCMV￾infected cells following AD169 infection (11), and it was
suggested that this was responsible for aiding the adhesion
of CD2+ lymphocytes to HCMV-infected cells. Later research
showed that the difference in CD58 expression on HCMV￾infected cells correlated with the amount of NK mediated killing
(49). This hypothesis was further supported recently, when it
was shown that blocking CD58 on the surface of AD169-infected
MRC-5 fibroblasts resulted in reduced IFNγ and TNF production
by NK cells (50).
However, this contrasted with data demonstrating
downregulation of CD58 on the surface of mature and
immature dendritic cells infected with clinical strains of HCMV
(51, 52). The basis of these contradictory results was uncovered
when we showed that HCMV infection with Merlin also led to a
decrease in CD58 on the surface of fibroblasts (44, 53), as a result
of UL148-mediated sequestration in the ER (12). Functionally,
this reduced both CD8+ T and NK cell activation. The effect
of UL148 was greatest on NK cell activation in the context of
antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), which is
consistent with reports that the CD2:CD58 pathway contributes
significantly to this process (54). Perhaps even more significantly
for the host, ADCC was detected against Merlin-infected cells
regardless of a full complement of NK evasion genes. The CD57+
population of adaptive NK cells, increases in which are associated
with previous HCMV infection (55), showed the most sensitivity
to inhibition induced by UL148 (12).
Other Genes in UL/b′ With the Potential to
Modulate NK Cells
Published systematic screen of genes within the UL/b′
region
were completed with a single cytotoxic readout using expression
of individual genes, and did not identify any other obvious NK
evasions (45). There is, however, great complexity in HCMV’s
interaction with the immune system, with examples of single
HCMV genes acting on multiple host proteins (e.g., UL141
targeting CD155 and TRAIL-Rs) or multiple HCMV genes
synergizing to act on a single host protein (e.g., UL141 and US2
against CD112). The latter function would not have been found
using a single gene expression system of screening, requiring
extended analysis with HCMV knockouts instead. Furthermore,
altering readouts may reveal otherwise hidden functions such
as those observed with UL148’s specific impact on ADCC (12).
Thus, there remains considerable potential for additional NK
immune modulators to be identified within the UL/b′
region. A
number of these are genes that exhibit high intrastrain variability,
in particular UL144, UL146, and UL147 (56), although no
functional differences have yet been reported to be associated
with these variants.
UL144 encodes an ortholog for the herpes virus entry
mediator (HVEM) (57), a member of the TNFR superfamily
(TNFRSF) with multiple immunomodulatory ligands including
LIGHT, CD160, B- and T-lymphocyte attenuator (BTLA) (58)
and lymphotoxin (LT). Treatment of HCMV-infected cells with
LT and LIGHT results in reduced spread of HCMV (59).
As receptors for HVEM are found on T and NK cells, it
was predicted that UL144 would affect both these effector
subsets. Significantly reduced proliferation of CD4+ T-cells has
been reported in the presence of plate bound UL144 (60).
This was attributed to the binding of UL144 to BTLA, a
co-inhibitory receptor. Unlike HVEM, UL144 cannot bind to
CD160, which normally provides a costimulatory signal for
NK-cells promoting cytolytic activity. Thus, UL144 has been
proposed to provide a specific inhibitory signal via BTLA
counterbalancing HVEM-induced activation signals through
CD160, but to date, actual inhibitory function for UL144 on NK
cells has not been demonstrated (61). Whilst UL144 is considered
variable, differences in UL144 genotype have not been reported

to carry prognostic value in infected fetuses or predict severity of
disease (62, 63).
UL144 may also have additional effects as it causes constitutive
NF-kB activation in isolation via recruitment of TRAF-6 (64).
This can result in expression of CCL22, a chemotactic factor,
which may affect migration of CCR4 expressing NK cells (65).
The microRNA-UL148D has also been shown in a lytic infection
to target another chemokine RANTES (regulated on activation,
normal T-cell expressed and secreted). The ligand for RANTES,
CCR5, can be detected on CD16− NK cells, which migrate
upon RANTES treatment (66). Therefore, the prevention of
RANTES production may potentially affect the migration of NK
cells toward HCMV infected cells. UL146 and UL147 encode
two additional viral chemokine homologs vCXCL1 and vCXCL2
respectively (58). UL146 increases NK cell migration (67).
Natural Variants of Other HCMV-Encoded
NK Modulators
Beyond in vitro acquired genetic variation, a number of HCMV￾encoded NK modulatory genes are naturally variable, likely
representing in vivo selection of virus genotypes by the immune
system. UL40 was the first HCMV-encoded NK evasion shown
to act during an active HCMV infection using a HCMV1UL40
on an AD169 background (26). This was achieved by TAP￾independent transfer of a peptide in the UL40 leader sequence
to bind and upregulate HLA-E, which then acts as a ligand
for the inhibitory CD94+NKG2A+ complex on NK cells (68,
69). However, HLA-E also binds the activating CD94+NKG2C+
complex with lower affinity (70), and silencing of HLA-E using
shRNAs inhibits the in vitro expansion of adaptive NKG2C+
NK cells driven by AD169-infected fibroblasts (71). UL40 itself
is hypervariable in HCMV strains, exhibiting mutations that can
abrogate UL40 expression altogether, or alter its HLA-E binding
peptide. The latter have now been shown to differentially inhibit
killing of HLA-E expressing RMA-S cells by NKG2A+ NK clones
(72) and drive NKG2C+ NK proliferation stimulated by the same
cells (19). Hammer and colleagues also elegantly demonstrated
differential activation of NKG2C+ NK cells by endothelial
cells infected with repaired TB40 containing the various UL40
mutants, highlighting one underlying mechanism driving the
activation and expansion of adaptive NK cells following HCMV
infection. This cannot, however, be the only mechanism as NK
expansions are also observed in HCMV seropositive NKG2Cnull
individuals (73).
There is also natural variation in UL18, the HLA-I homolog
which binds to the inhibitory leukocyte immunoglobulin like
receptor (LIR1, LILBR1) (74, 75). These variants exhibit altered
capacities to bind LIR1 (76, 77) and differentiate a HCMV strains’
susceptibility to LIR1+ NK cell control in viral spread assays (78).
UL18 can vary by up to 20 amino acids (76), and this occurs
outside of the peptide binding groove (79). The affinity of LIR1
for UL18, but not its host ligand HLA-G, is affected by genetic
variation in the LIR1 gene (80). The differences in LIR1 genotype
correlate with control of HCMV disease in renal transplant
patients and altered NK-cell activation (81). Thus, UL18 is an
example whereby a small change in the binding affinity between
a viral and host protein can be mapped to specific SNPs, which
can predict disease outcome following transplantation. To add
further complexity, UL40 can upregulate the expression of UL18,
even when truncation cleaves the HLA-E binding peptide and
disrupts upregulation of HLA-E suggesting distinct functions
(82). The impact of UL40 variants on UL18 expression, and
therefore on LIR-1+ NK cells, remains unknown.
In general, however, the majority of HCMV-encoded NK
modulators are not considered particularly variable. A summary
of all of those with an established direct impact on NK activation,
and an indication of their degree of genetic variability and
whether they are found in the UL/b′
region is provided in Table 1.

Patel et al. Genetic Variation and HCMV-Encoded NK Modulators
It is perhaps of note that where variability does occur, the affected
proteins interact with host systems that are in turn very variable:
UL142 targets MICA that is highly polymorphic; UL40 provides
peptides that bind HLA-E; while UL18’s ligand LIR1 interacts
with the most polymorphic human gene family of all, HLA-I.
Furthermore, our current knowledge suggests that MICA alleles
are targeted by at least 5 HCMV genes (UL142, UL148A, US9,
US18, and US20), while the less polymorphic MICB and ULBPs
only by two (UL16, miRNA-UL112). Thus, HCMV may have
to dedicate more of its genome to tackling highly polymorphic
immune selection. Only further research will determine how
significant these associations are.
CONCLUDING REMARKS
Investigating regions of genetic instability has aided us in
identifying and focusing research on several of HCMV’s
impressive arsenal of NK evasion functions. Caution is, however,
required when interpreting data from these passaged viruses
as they generally do not fully represent the clinical agent in
respect to biological properties, process of infection, tropism
and immune evasion. Unfortunately, the use of clinical isolates
is also extremely problematic because they produce very low
titers of infectious virus, they can exhibit natural genetic
deletions, and mutants are selected very rapidly following in vitro
isolation. The production of BAC-cloned viruses containing
verified wildtype genomes offers a solution, however even with
these, the presence of natural variants that alter NK responses
means that ideally multiple strains should be compared. Despite
these difficulties, the extra effort to study HCMV in settings
as close as possible to those found in vivo will be worthwhile
as it is likely to shed light on the underlying reasons why
infection induces such unusual NK and T-cell expansions,
which will in turn inform on the potential use of HCMV as
an unique vaccine vector. Uncovering individual functions of
novel HCMV-encoded immune modulators will undoubtedly
continue to further our knowledge of HCMV virulence factors
and our understanding of basic NK cell biology, but more
global approaches that take into account selection-driven genetic
variation and multiple gene interactions will be needed to fully
understand how we can manipulate HCMV for our own ends.
