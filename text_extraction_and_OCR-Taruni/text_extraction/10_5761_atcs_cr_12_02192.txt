A 52-year-old man suffering from dilated cardiomyopathy underwent implantable left 
ventricular assist device (LVAD) insertion as a bridge to transplantation. He presented 
with evidence of LVAD-related mediastinitis and pump pocket infection 57 days after the 
LVAD implantation. The mediastinum was reopened and irrigated. A large amount of 
pus was observed around the outflow and inflow conduits and in the pump pocket. Nega￾tive pressure wound therapy (NPWT) was initiated. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus 
aureus (MRSA) was isolated from blood and mediastinal pus. Enterobacter cloacae was 
also isolated by mediastinal pus culture after the beginning of the NPWT. Three weeks 
after the start of the NPWT, the pus culture became negative, and omental transposition 
and sternal closure were performed. Intravenous antibiotics were administered until 
day 42, with the treatment subsequently switched to oral antibiotics. He was discharged 
from the hospital on day 57 and followed up at the outpatient clinic. Our findings suggest 
that NPWT followed by omental transposition be useful to treat mediastinitis or pump 
pocket infection after implantable LVAD insertion.

Introduction
It is difficult to treat mediastinitis and pump pocket 
infection in patients who have undergone left ventricular 
assist device (LVAD) implantation because it is difficult 
to remove the infected artificial materials from the medi￾astinum or the pump pocket. There were reports that 
described successful treatment of LVAD pocket infection 
by omental transposition.1,2) However, a pump pocket 
infection remains a significant cause of mortality in 
patients after LVAD implantation.3) Negative pressure 
wound therapy (NPWT) has been reported to be useful for 
the treatment of mediastinitis after open heart surgery.4,5)
Recently, NPWT has been successfully used to treat 
mediastinitis after paracorporeal LVAD implantation.6)

LVAD Pump Pocket Infection Treated by NPWT
However, it remains unclear whether NPWT is useful for 
the treatment of mediastinitis involving pump pocket 
infection in patients undergoing implantable LVAD inser￾tion. We report a case in which NPWT followed by omental 
transposition successfully controlled pump pocket infec￾tion occurring as a complication after implantable LVAD 
insertion.
Case Report
The patient was a 52-year-old man suffering from 
dilated cardiomyopathy with a history of mitral valve 
replacement and tricuspid annuloplasty 3 years before, 
and implantation of biventricular pacemaker with 
defibrillator 2 years and 8 months earlier. He underwent 
an implantable LVAD (EVAHEARTTM: Sun Medical 
Technology Research Corp., Nagano, Japan) insertion 
via re-sternotomy as a bridge to transplantation. The 
postoperative course was uneventful. On day 46 after the 
LVAD implantation, he was discharged from the hospital 
without any symptoms.
After leaving the hospital, the patient developed gen￾eralized edema and gained 6 kg over a 10-day period. 
He developed a fever of 39°C 11 days after discharge 
(57 postoperative days), and he was readmitted. The 
clinical examination of blood revealed a white blood cell 
(WBC) count of 4,700/ml and C-reactive protein (CRP) 
level of 32.2 mg/dl. Pus discharge was observed from the 
midsternal incision. The mediastinum was reopened and 
irrigated with a large amount of warm saline. There was 
a large amount of pus around the outflow and inflow con￾duits and in the pump pocket (Fig. 1). NPWT was initi￾ated using Mepilex® Border (Mönlycke Health Care, 
Gothenburg, Sweden) and Mepilex® Transfer (Mönlycke 
Health Care, Sweden) as described by Kinoshita, et al.7)
High negative pressure (-99 cmH2O) was applied using 
HAMA SERVO-DRAIN (INNOMEDICS Medical 
Instruments, Inc., Tokyo, Japan). Irrigation of the medi￾astinal space and exchange of dressing film was per￾formed daily. The signs of infection resolved rapidly. 
The patient was extubated on day 13. The cardiac sur￾face was covered with good granulation tissue by 2 
weeks after the NPWT. NPWT was switched from the 
use of Mepilex® Border and Mepilex® Transfer to that 
using the V.A.C. ATS® Therapy System (Kinetic Con￾cepts, Inc., San Antonio, Texas, USA). He was fed via a 
gastric tube from day 2 and was started on oral nutrition 
on day 22. He was kept on bed rest until the sternal clo￾sure.
Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) 
was isolated from blood and mediastinal pus. Antibiotic 
treatment was started with vancomycin, which was 
switched to linezolid due to renal dysfunction on day 9. 
Linezolid was further switched to teicoplanin because 
of thrombocytopenia on day 22. On day 11, Entero￾bacter cloacae were also isolated from mediastinal 
pus. Cefepime was added. Finally, mediastinal and 
pump pocket culture became negative for infection. The 
frequency of mediastinal space irrigation and V.A.C.®
GranuFoamTM exchange was reduced to every other day 
once the mediastinal culture became negative.
The NPWT was continued for 4 weeks. The WBC 
count was 6,000s /ml, and the serum CRP level decreased 
to the range of 1.0 to 2.0 mg/dl. Omental transposition 
and sternal closure were performed on day 29. An 
omental pedicle graft with the left gastroepiploic artery 
was prepared through a midline abdomen incision. The 
back of the sternum and the blood pump was covered 
with the omental pedicle (Fig. 2), and the sternum was 
closed. Antibiotic treatment was continued until day 42. 
Then, oral sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim combination 
was started. The patient was discharged from the hospital 
on day 57. The WBC count was 2,800 /ml and CRP level 
was 1.1 mg/dl at the time of discharge. There was no 
sign of recurrence of mediastinitis four months after the 
sternal closure.
Discussion
Pump-related infection remains a significant cause 
of mortality in patients receiving an LVAD as a bridge to 
Fig. 1 Thoracotomy at the time of development of 
pump pocket infection. View after removal of 
the infected tissue covering the pump pocket. 
There was a large amount of pus in the pump 
pocket and around the inflow conduit.

Kimura M, et al.
transplantation.3,8) There were reports of successful treat￾ment of pump pocket infection by omental transposi￾tion.1,2) Patients with sepsis after LVAD implantation 
have higher mortality those without sepsis.9) In the 
present case, the patient presented with high fever and 
positive blood and mediastinal pus culture.
Kurihara, et al. reported a case of outflow vascular 
prosthesis rerouting for the treatment of mediastinitis 
complicating LVAD implantation.10) Another report 
described a successful treatment of LVAD pump pocket 
infection by intra-abdominal relocation and omental 
transposition.11) However, relocation method might be 
limited to paracorporeal LVAD-related mediastinitis or 
small pump infection.
NPWT has been recognized as a useful treatment 
modality for post-sternotomy mediastinitis.4,5) Sjögren, 
et al. reported that NPWT reduced mortality of post￾sternotomy mediastinitis compared with conventional 
treatment using omentum or pectoral muscle flap.5) There 
was a report of successful NPWT for mediastinitis devel￾oping after aortic arch replacement without removal of 
the prosthetic graft.12) In that case, the patient who under￾went NPWT followed by omental transposition and ster￾nal closure survived until discharge without recurrence. 
This report suggested that NPWT followed omental trans￾position yield good control of the graft infection.
Application of NPWT has recently been proposed 
for the control of mediastinitis in patients with paracor￾poreal LVAD implantation. Kawata, et al. reported two 
cases of mediastinitis developing after paracorporeal 
LVAD implantation treated successfully by NPWT.6)
There is no robust clinical evidence to conclude whether 
the combination of NPWT with omental transposition 
is superior to omental transposition alone for LVAD 
pump pocket infection. However, based on clinical expe￾rience of treatment for post-sternotomy mediastinitis,5,13)
the combination therapy of NPWT with omental trans￾position might be a reliable option in high-risk patients 
suffering pump pocket infection compared with con￾ventional treatment. The appropriate duration of NPWT 
remains unknown. We propose that the treatment is con￾tinued until the mediastinal pus culture becomes nega￾tive. In the present case, the sternal closure with omental 
transposition was performed 8 days after the mediastinal 
culture became negative.
This case suggests that a patient developing mediasti￾nitis or pump pocket infection after an implantable LVAD 
insertion could be rescued by NPWT, followed by omen￾tal transposition without removal of the infected device.
Conclusion
Negative pressure wound therapy followed by omen￾tal transposition may be useful to treat mediastinitis or 
pump pocket infection developing after insertion of an 
implantable LVAD.
