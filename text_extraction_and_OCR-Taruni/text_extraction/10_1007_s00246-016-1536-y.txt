Abstract Cardiopulmonary exercise testing is an impor￾tant tool to predict prognosis in children and adults with
heart failure. A much less sophisticated exercise test is the
6 min walk test, which has been shown an independent
predictor for morbidity and mortality in adults with heart
failure. Therefore, we hypothesized that the 6 min walk
test could be predictive for outcome in children with
dilated cardiomyopathy. We prospectively included 49
children with dilated cardiomyopathy C6 years who
performed a 6 min walk test. Median age was 11.9 years
(interquartile range [IQR] 7.4–15.1), median time after
diagnosis was 3.6 years (IQR 0.6–7.4). The 6 min walk
distance was transformed to a percentage of predicted,
using age- and gender-specific norm values (6MWD%).
For all patients, mean 6MWD% was 70 ± 21%. Median
follow-up was 33 months (IQR 14–50). Ten patients

6MWD% resulted in a lower risk of death or transplanta￾tion (hazard ratio 0.95 per percentage increase, p = 0.006).
A receiver operating characteristic curve was generated to
define the optimal threshold to identify patients at highest
risk for an endpoint. Patients with a 6MWD% \63% had a
2 year transplant-free survival of 73%, in contrast to a
transplant-free survival of 92% in patients with a

cardiomyopathy, the 6 min walk test is a simple and fea￾sible tool to identify children with a higher risk of death or

Introduction
Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) is an important
tool which is used to predict prognosis in adults with heart
failure [1–3]. Currently, heart transplantation is recom￾mended in patients with a peak oxygen uptake
(VO2)\12–14 ml/kg/min, depending on whether patients
tolerate beta-blockers or not. In women and in younger
patients (\50 years), it has been suggested that those with a
peak VO2\50% of predicted need to be considered for
transplantation [4]. Similarly, for children a peak
VO2\50% of predicted for age and sex has been accepted
as a Class I indication for heart transplantation (level of
evidence C) [5]. More recently, Giardini et al. [6] studied
ambulatory children with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM)
and demonstrated that a peak VO2 B 62% of predicted was
associated with a 10 times higher risk of death and urgent
transplantation than a peak VO2[62%. Although these
results are of great importance for heart failure manage￾ment in children, the use of CPET has some important
limitations. It is time-consuming and demanding for
patients with severe heart failure. Moreover, it requires
sophisticated equipment and specially trained staff. A
much less sophisticated exercise test is the 6 min walk test
(6MWT). In adults with heart failure, this simple exercise
test has been shown an independent predictor for morbidity
and mortality [7, 8]. Furthermore, in children with pul￾monary hypertension, the 6MWT has been used to indicate
disease severity as predictor for death and transplantation
and to measure treatment effects [9, 10]. Notably, an
advantage of the 6MWT is that it can be performed starting
from the age of 6 years.
In the present study, we test the hypothesis that the
6MWT is predictive for the endpoint of death or heart
transplantation in children with DCM.
Methods
This prospective study was approved by the institutional
review boards of all seven participating centers. All parents
and patients C 12 years gave their written informed
consent.
Patients (C6 years) diagnosed with DCM or followed￾up from November 1, 2010, until July 1, 2015, were asked
to participate in this study. DCM was defined as the pres￾ence of impaired systolic function (fractional shortening
[FS] B 25%) and left ventricular (LV) dilation (LV end￾diastolic dimension [LVEDD] z-score [?2 for body sur￾face area). DCM could be idiopathic or secondary to other
causes. Patients with structural heart defects or neuro￾muscular disease were excluded.
Six-Minute Walk Test
At enrollment, all patients performed a 6 min walk test
(6MWT) on an 8 m track in a straight corridor. Patients
were instructed to walk back and forth on a self-chosen
walking speed; running was not allowed. The objective of
the test was to walk as far as possible within 6 min. If
needed, patients were allowed to slow down the pace or to
stop, but were encouraged to resume walking as soon as
they were able to. All patients got the same instructions and
encouragement at regular intervals, according to the
guideline of the American Thoracic Society [11]. During
the test, the number of laps was counted. The lap that was
partially completed at the end of the test was measured and
added to the total distance. The distance walked during
6 min (6MWD) was compared with gender-specific norm
values as reported by Geiger et al. [12] using height and
age in their regression equations. A percentage of predicted
(6MWD%) was calculated by dividing the patients’
6MWD by the patients’ predicted 6MWD, and multiplying
this by 100%. Transcutaneous oxygen saturation and heart
rate were recorded before and immediately after the test.
Using a maximum heart rate of 200 beats per minute (bpm)
for all ages, [13] the heart rate immediately after the test
was transformed to a percentage of the maximum.
At the same visit, patients’ demographics were recorded.
Height and weight were measured. N-terminal pro-B-type
natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) was determined. A com￾plete and standardized echocardiogram was performed and
analyzed off-line by one investigator (SdB). M-mode of the
parasternal long-axis was used to measure LVEDD and LV
end-systolic dimension and subsequently, FS was calcu￾lated. LV ejection fraction was calculated using Simpson’s
biplane method. The 6MWT results were not relayed to the
treating physicians and were only stored in the research
database. Results of the 6MWT were not used in clinical

decisions. The study endpoint was death or heart trans￾plantation. Listing strategies followed the American Heart
Association guidelines [5]. Follow-up continued until
September 15, 2015.
Statistical Analysis
Continuous variables are displayed as mean ± standard
deviation (SD) if normally distributed, and as median with
interquartile range (IQR) if non-normally distributed. NT￾proBNP results were log-transformed because of the non￾normal distribution. Means across groups were compared
using independent sample t test. Transplant-free survival
was estimated with the Kaplan–Meier method, and 95%
confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using Green￾wood’s formula. The log-rank test was used to determine
statistical significance between two transplant-free survival
curves. A receiver operating characteristic curve was
generated using 6MWD% to define the optimal threshold
to identify patients at highest risk for an endpoint. Uni￾variable Cox regression analysis was used to test the pre￾dictive value of 6MWD% as a continuous and as a
binominal variable based on the threshold. Other potential
risk factors were also tested with univariable Cox regres￾sion. The number of variables allowed for multivariable
analysis was set at the number of events divided by ten. All
analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics for
Windows, version 21.0 (IMB Corp, Armonk, NY). Testing
was performed two-sided, and statistical significance was
defined as p\0.05.
Results
During the 4.5 years of the study, 64 patients were eligible,
56 (88%) gave written informed consent. Seven patients
were too ill and reached the endpoint before they per￾formed a 6MWT. In total, 49 patients performed a 6MWT,
at a median age of 11.9 years. The median time since
diagnosis was 3.6 years; 9 (18%) were included within
3 months of diagnosis, 35 (71%) more than 1 year after
diagnosis. Patients were on optimal pharmacological ther￾apy, 94% used angiotensin converting enzyme-inhibitors
and 78% used beta-blockers (Table 1). In patients included
within 1 year of diagnosis, the use of beta-blockers was
somewhat lower and NTproBNP was higher, but overall
the profile of those included within and after 1 year of
presentation was comparable (Table 1.)
Six-Minute Walk Test Results
Mean 6 min walk distance as percentage of predicted
(6MWD%) was 70 ± 21%. There was no difference in
6MWD% in patients included within or more than 1 year
after presentation reaching an endpoint (53 vs. 52%), or
not reaching an endpoint (64 vs. 75%). Patients included
[1 yr after presentation reaching an endpoint scored
lower (52 vs. 75% P\0.05); the group \1 year after
presentation was too small to test statistically. Two
patients (4%) stopped walking during the test. The dis￾tance that they covered was accepted as final result of the
6MWT. One patient, 6.8 years old, complained about
chest pain and stopped walking at 3 min. The second
patient, 6.0 years old, stopped several times, because she
felt too tired. She had severe heart failure and underwent
heart transplantation 4 months after the test. No other
complications were registered during the tests. The heart
rate before and immediately after the test is displayed in
Table 2. Pre-6MWT, the mean heart rate in patients not
taking beta-blockers was significantly higher
(98 ± 12 bpm) than in patients with beta-blocker therapy
(85 ± 15 bpm, p = 0.02). No differences in age were
found between patients with and without beta-blocker
therapy. Post-6MWT, the mean HR was 124 ± 18 bpm,
which was 62% of the maximum. Patients not taking
beta-blockers had a mean heart rate of 66 ± 8% of the
maximum, while this was 61 ± 9% in those using beta￾blockers (p = 0.08).
Outcome
During the study, ten patients reached the endpoint of heart
transplantation, none of the patients died. In these patients,
NTproBNP and LVEDD z-score was higher and FS and EF
were lower (Table 3) underscoring the severity of their
heart disease at the time of the 6MWT. At the time of
listing, 80% had a Class I indication for heart transplan￾tation, three were admitted on inotropes, one intermittently
on inotropes, and the others had severe limitations in daily
life, in many more than 50% absence from school. At the
time of transplantation, the three patients on inotropes all
had progressed to require MCS, all others were at home.
The time on the waiting list varied from 1 day to more than
3 years. Of all study patients, the median follow-up time
was 33 months. This resulted in a 1 year transplant-free
survival of 89% (95% CI 80–98) and 2 year transplant-free
survival of 84% (95% CI 74–95). The median time from
diagnosis to transplantation was 3.9 years (IQR 2.4–8.2);
the three patients that were tested \1 year of presentation
underwent transplantation after 1.7–2.4 years. The seven
patients who were too ill to perform a 6 MWT before they
reached an endpoint had a median time from DCM diag￾nosis to the endpoint of 31 days (IQR 16–75). Of them,
three died and four were transplanted (two of whom were
on mechanical circulatory support).

Risk Factors for Outcome
The 6MWD% was a significant predictor for the risk of
death or transplantation (hazard ratio 0.95 per % of pre￾dicted, 95% CI 0.91–0.99, p = 0.006). Thus, every %
decrease in the 6MWD%, gave a 5% increase in the risk of
death or transplantation. A 6MWD% \63% identified
patients at highest risk for an endpoint (sensitivity 80% and
specificity 69%, area under the curve 0.76, 95% CI
0.57–0.95, p = 0.01). One-year transplant-free survival
was 79% (95% CI 61–98), and 2 year transplant-free sur￾vival was 73% (95% CI 53–93), in contrast to patients with
a 6MWD% C 63% in whom 1 year transplant-free sur￾vival was 96% (95% CI 89–100), and 2 year transplant￾free survival was 92% (95% CI 82–100, p = 0.003,

showed that a higher NT-proBNP and LVEDD z-score and
a lower LV SF and EF were significantly predictive for the
risk of death or transplantation (Table 3). The number of
events in this study did not allow multivariable analysis.
Discussion
In this prospective study, we demonstrated that the 6 min
walking distance expressed as a percentage of predicted
was associated with prognosis in children with DCM. A
higher total distance walked in 6 min resulted in a lower
risk of death or heart transplantation. This is important
because markers that identify children with a good or bad
prognosis during follow-up are essential to guide clinical
management in this patient group.
The study group had a mean age of 11.9 years and a
median time since DCM diagnosis of 3.6 years,
representing children with chronic heart failure. Although
DCM has high incidence rates at young age, [14] the age￾restriction for the test resulted in a relatively older group.
An earlier study investigating the predictive value of CPET
included patients with a mean age of 13.5 years, reflecting
the somewhat older age at which CPET can be performed
[6].
All study patients who reached an endpoint, underwent
transplantation. Earlier outcome results of children with
DCM have shown that after the first year of diagnosis, the
large majority of children reaching an endpoint undergo
transplantation [15, 16]. The median time after diagnosis in
our study group was 3.6 years, which may explain the
relatively high number of transplantations compared to
deaths. Furthermore, our results indicate that children that
were included early after presentation and who were able to
perform a 6MWT represent a less sicker part of the pop￾ulation. The children that were unable to perform a 6MWT
all reached an endpoint early after presentation, while those
who could perform a 6MWT and reached an endpoint,
underwent transplantation 2 years after presentation. The
6MWT has been done for research purposes only, and the
results were not relayed to the treating physicians. Con￾sequently, the 6MWT results have not influenced trans￾plantation decisions. Therefore, the 6MWT can be used as
predictor for deterioration of the disease during the follow￾up of DCM.
After 4.5 years of patient inclusion and almost 3 years
of follow-up, the number of endpoints was limited and
multivariable analysis was not allowed. The predictive
value of other variables on outcome was assessed to
characterize our patient population and we showed that
besides the 6MWD%, NT-proBNP, LVEDD z-score,
LVEF and LVFS were predictive. Considering the uni￾variable results after correcting for multiple testing, a
p value of\0.0071 would be significant. At this level, the
6MWD% and LVEF would remain significant. LVEF has

been shown to be predictive in earlier pediatric reports and
has also been valuable in predicting prognosis in adults
[17, 18]. The 6MWD% is a new finding in children and is
likely an easily accessible and valuable tool in predicting
outcome in this patient group. We suspect that serial testing
may enhance the predictive value of the 6MWT in this
chronic heart failure population, but more data and more
endpoints need to be accumulated to test that assumption.
Further investigation in a larger population needs to
establish whether the 6MWT holds as an independent
marker in multivariable analysis.
Exercise testing is one of the cornerstones in predicting
prognosis in ambulatory heart failure patients [1–4].
Specifically, peak VO2 measured with CPET has a
prominent role in heart transplantation guidelines [4, 5]. A
peak VO2\12–14 ml/kg/min in adults and \50% of
predicted in children has been accepted as a Class I indi￾cation for heart transplantation. In addition, the 6MWT has
been shown to be a predictor for mortality and hospital￾ization for adults with chronic heart failure [7, 8, 19, 20].
Although it seems that CPET results are superior to 6MWT
results in order to predict prognosis, [19, 21] the 6MWT
has major advantages, such as its simplicity and its inex￾pensiveness. Therefore, it is particularly relevant as follow￾up and screening tool.
As CPET measures maximal exercise capacity, the
6MWT measures submaximal exercise capacity. This is
also reflected by the maximal heart rates reached with the
6MWT. Post-6MWT, we found a mean heart rate of 62%
of the maximum, while this was around 70% in the norm
population [12]. In patients with heart failure chronotropic
incompetence has been described as a result of beta-re￾ceptor down-regulation and desensitization of the beta-re￾ceptors [22]. Moreover, beta-blocker therapy may affect
the ability to reach the maximal heart rate as predicted for
age. A prevalence of 37% of chronotropic incompetence
has been described in a cohort of children with chronic
DCM [6]. Thus, maximal heart rates may well have been
lower in patients in our study. By assuming a maximal
heart rate of 200 bpm, the submaximal heart rate as per￾centage of the maximum may have been underestimated.
Study Limitations
We studied almost all eligible children (88%) in the
Netherlands during a 4 year period, but the sample size was
small. Furthermore, we did not measure maximal exercise
capacity (CPET) in our cohort. Nevertheless, we were able
to show that the 6MWT is feasible and easy to perform in
children with DCM and is a valuable predictor for out￾come. Therefore, 6 min walk testing should be imple￾mented in this patient group to estimate the patients’ risk
and to analyze these results in future studies using
multivariate analysis. Furthermore, we used an 8 m track to
obtain the results, rather than a 30 m track as is recom￾mended in the American Thoracic Society guidelines [11].
Because 6MWTs were performed at seven different centers
and not all had a quiet 30 m corridor available, we decided
to use an 8 m track in all centers to minimize test variation.
We recognize that the use of a shorter track has led to more
turning points and may have led to a small reduction in the
total distance walked. However, because patients walked
slower than healthy children, this would have had less
impact. To interpret our recommended cutoff to a popu￾lation walked on a 30 m track, the cutoff may become
slightly higher. Finally, the cutoff is based on our dataset
and may differ in another population. Therefore, it needs to
be validated externally.
Conclusions
In the present study, we demonstrate that the 6 min walk
test is feasible and has predictive value in children with
DCM C 6 years. A lower distance walked, expressed as
percentage of predicted, was associated with a higher risk
of death or heart transplantation. A cutoff of
6MWD% \63% identified patients at highest risk of an
endpoint.
