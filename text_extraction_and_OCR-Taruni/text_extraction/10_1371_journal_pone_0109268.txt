Abstract
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). (Pro)renin receptor (PRR) is
activated in the kidney of CKD. The present study aimed to determine the role of indoxyl sulfate (IS), a uremic toxin, in PRR
activation in rat aorta and human aortic smooth muscle cells (HASMCs). We examined the expression of PRR and renin/
prorenin in rat aorta using immunohistochemistry. Both CKD rats and IS-administrated rats showed elevated expression of
PRR and renin/prorenin in aorta compared with normal rats. IS upregulated the expression of PRR and prorenin in HASMCs.
N-acetylcysteine, an antioxidant, and diphenyleneiodonium, an inhibitor of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate
oxidase, suppressed IS-induced expression of PRR and prorenin in HASMCs. Knock down of organic anion transporter 3
(OAT3), aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and nuclear factor-kB p65 (NF-kB p65) with small interfering RNAs inhibited IS￾induced expression of PRR and prorenin in HASMCs. Knock down of PRR inhibited cell proliferation and tissue factor
expression induced by not only prorenin but also IS in HASMCs.
Conclusion: IS stimulates aortic expression of PRR and renin/prorenin through OAT3-mediated uptake, production of
reactive oxygen species, and activation of AhR and NF-kB p65 in vascular smooth muscle cells. IS-induced activation of PRR
promotes cell proliferation and tissue factor expression in vascular smooth muscle cells.

Introduction
Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at high risk for
cardiovascular disease (CVD). CKD leads to accelerated athero￾sclerosis and consequently to a marked increase in cardiovascular
morbidity and mortality [1]. Accumulation of indoxyl sulfate (IS),
a protein-bound uremic toxin, is involved in the progression of not
only CKD, but also CVD [2–4]. IS is a metabolite of tryptophan
derived from dietary protein, and is synthesized in the liver from
indole that is produced by intestinal flora including Escherichia
coli. IS is normally excreted into urine. As renal function
deteriorates, IS accumulates in serum due to its reduced renal
clearance [2,5]. Because of its protein binding ability, removal by
hemodialysis is not as efficient as that of non-protein bound uremic
toxin. IS shows nephrotoxicity after its uptake by renal proximal
tubular cells through the basolateral membrane via organic anion
transporter 1 (OAT1) and OAT3 [6].
IS induces reactive oxygen species (ROS) and activates nuclear
factor-kB (NF-kB) [7], p53 [8], and signal transducer and
activator of transcription 3 (Stat3) [9]. Then, IS stimulates renal
expression of fibrotic genes such as transforming growth factor-b1
(TGF-b1) [7,10], and a-smooth muscle actin (SMA) [7,8], and
inflammatory genes such as monocyte chemotactic protein-1
(MCP-1) and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) in
proximal tubular cells [11,12]. These pathophysiological changes
facilitate kidney dysfunction such as interstitial fibrosis and
inflammation, accelerating the progression of CKD [2,3].
Besides its negative effect on kidney, serum level of IS was
associated with CVD and mortality in CKD patients [13]. IS
promoted aortic calcification and senescence in hypertensive rats
[14], and induced dysfunction of vascular endothelial cells [15,16],
vascular smooth muscle cells [17,18], and cardiomyocytes [19,20].
Thus, IS is a nephrovascular uremic toxin [3].
Renin angiotensin system (RAS) plays an important role in
CKD. (Pro)renin receptor (PRR), which binds to both renin and
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 October 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 10 | e109268

prorenin, is a newly discovered component of RAS, and is highly
expressed not only in the kidney, but also in cardiovascular system
[21–23].
Prorenin bound to PRR becomes enzymatically active, and can
catalyze angiotensinogen into angiotensin (Ang) I. Further, PRR
bound to prorenin or renin induces intracellular signaling and
activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) ERK1/2,
leading to activation of TGF-b1, independent of Ang II
production [21,24]. PRR is expressed in the subendothelium of
coronary arteries and, more precisely, in vascular smooth muscle
cells [22]. Upregulation of PRR is involved in renal fibrosis
[21,25], and vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation [22,26,27].
Further, recent studies revealed different roles of PRR, linked to
the vacuolar H+
-ATPase (V-ATPase) activity, Wnt signaling, and
autophagy [28–32]. Thus, PRR activation plays an important role
in the pathophysiology of not only CKD but also CVD.
IS induces vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation through
ROS and activation of p44/42 MAPK pathway [33,34]. IS
induces tissue factor expression and activity in vascular smooth
muscle cells [35]. Tissue factor is a crucial mediator of injury￾related thrombosis and vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation,
and has been implicated for stent thrombosis observed in patients
with advanced CKD [35]. However, the role of IS in PRR
expression in vascular smooth muscle cells has not yet been
studied.
The present study aimed to clarify whether IS induces PRR
expression in rat aortic tissues and human aortic smooth muscle
cells (HASMCs), and whether PRR mediates IS-induced cell
proliferation and tissue factor expression in HASMCs.
Methods
Reagents
Reagents and antibodies were obtained from the following
companies: HASMCs were purchased from Cascade Biologics
(Portland, OR, USA). Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (D￾MEM), fetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin–streptomycin and
trypsin-EDTA solutions were purchased from Gibco (Invitrogen,
Grand Island, NY, USA). IS was from Sigma Chemical (St. Louis,
MO, USA). N-acetylcyteine (NAC), an antioxidant, and dipheny￾leneiodonium chloride (DPI), an inhibitor of nicotinamide adenine
dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase, were obtained from
Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA, USA). Human prorenin was obtained
from Molecular Innovations (Novi, MI, USA). Anti-PRR and anti￾prorenin antibodies were from Abcam (Cambridge, UK). Anti￾renin/prorenin antibody used for immunohistochemistry, which
cross-reacts with renin and prorenin [36], was kindly provided by
Tadashi Inagami (Department of Biochemistry, Vanderbilt
University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN, USA). Anti-NF￾kB p65, anti-aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), and anti-tissue
factor antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa

Animal Study 1
Experimental rats were prepared as reported previously [37].
Seven-week old male Sprague-Dawley rats (Clea, Tokyo, Japan)
were used to produce CKD rats by 5/6- nephrectomy. Eleven
weeks after subtotal nephrectomy, the rats were randomized into
two groups, control CKD rats (n = 8), and AST-120-treated CKD
rats (n = 8). AST-120 was orally administered to the rats at a dose
of 4 g/kg/day with powder chow (CE-2, Clea, Tokyo, Japan) for
10 weeks, whereas powder chow alone was administered to control
CKD rats. Normal rats (n = 9) were used to compare the data with
CKD rats. After administration of AST-120 for 16 weeks, the rats
were anesthetized, and arcuate aortas were excised for immuno￾histochemical study.
Animal Study 2
Experimental rats were prepared as reported previously [38].
Briefly, the animal groups consisted of: (1) Dahl normotensive rats
(DN, n = 8), (2) Dahl normotensive IS-administered rats (DN+IS,
n = 8), (3) Dahl hypertensive rats (DH, n = 8), and (4) Dahl
hypertensive IS-administered rats (DH+IS, n = 8). IS (200 mg/kg/
day in drinking water) was administered to the rats. At 48 weeks of
age (32nd week of the study), their arcuate aortas were excised for
immunohistochemical analysis. Serum IS levels were measured by
high-performance liquid chromatography as reported previously
[5]. Blood pressure was measured using the tails of the rats with a
pneumatic cuff and a sphygmomanometer for small animals (UR￾5000, Ueda Avancer Co., Tokyo, Japan).
The Animal Care Committee of Kureha Biomedical Research
Laboratories approved these animal studies, which proceeded
according to the Guiding Principles for the Care and Use of
Laboratory Animals of the Japanese Pharmacological Society.
Immunohistochemistry
Immunohistochemistry was performed according to the strep￾tavidin-biotinylated peroxidase complex (SABC) method. Aortic
sections were deparaffinized with xylene, and dehydrated with
ethanol. Endogenous peroxidase activity was inhibited with 0.3%
H2O2 in methanol at room temperature for 10 min, followed by a
rinse with phosphate buffered saline (PBS). All sections were
incubated with 10% normal serum at room temperature for
30 min. Heat-mediated antigen retrieval method was performed
twice by microwave treatment with 0.01 mol/L citrate buffer
(pH 6.0) for 5 min. Then, the sections were treated at 4uC
overnight with a primary antibody, anti-PRR antibody (1:100) or
anti-renin/prorenin (1:50) antibody which cross reacts with renin
and prorenin. Then, the sections were incubated with a secondary
antibody at room temperature for 30 min followed by a rinse with
PBS, and then treated with peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin
(Nichirei Co) at 37uC for 30 min. Finally, localization of PRR and
renin/prorenin was visualized using 3,3-diaminobenzidine tetra￾hydrochloride (DAB tablet; Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany)
at a concentration of 30 mg/mL, containing 0.03% H2O2. Then,
the sections were counterstained with methylene green, and
mounted in mounting media (Mount-quick, Daydo Sangyo Co.,
Saitama, Japan). All sections were photographed under light
microscopy (6400) with digital camera (DN100, E-600, Nikon;
Tokyo, Japan). Immunostaining-positive areas were determined
using Adobe Photoshop, and quantified in 10 random fields per
section using NIH Image 1.62.
Cell Culture
HASMCs were maintained in D-MEM containing 10% FBS
supplemented with 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 mg/mL streptomy￾cin at standard cell culture condition (37uC under 5% CO2
humidified atmosphere). The medium was replaced every three
days until confluence. Only cells between passages 2 to 8 were
used for experiments.

Measurement of Cell Proliferation
Proliferation of HASMCs was measured using Cell Titer 96
Aqueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay [16]. Cells were
seeded at a density of 56103 cells/well on 24 well culture plate in
D-MEM containing 10% FBS for 48 h. Serum-starved HASMCs
(56103 cells/well) in a 24-well plate were stimulated with or
without IS (250 mmol/L) or prorenin (20 nmol/L) for 24 h. For
gene knockdown experiment, HASMCs were transfected with
siRNA for PRR (20 nmol/L) for 48 h, before IS or prorenin
stimulation. Thereafter, cell proliferation reagent MTS (50 mL)
was added to each well, and cells were incubated for 4 h. The
absorbance was measured at 492 nm using a microplate reader
(DS PharmaBiomedical Co., Ltd, Osaka, Japan).
Quantitative Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT￾PCR)
Total RNA was extracted from HASMCs lysates using TRIzol
Reagent (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) and subjected to
reverse transcription. The cDNA was subjected to a quantitative
RT-PCR analysis with the use of a Bio-Rad CFX96 RT-PCR
Detection System and Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Serial dilutions of a control
sample of cDNA were used as the standard curve for each
reaction. All experiments were performed in triplicate. Changes in
gene expression were normalized the values to the levels of
glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). Primers
(Sigma-Aldrich) used were: PRR, 59-AAT TGG CCT ATA CCA
GGA GAG C-39 (forward) and 59-GAA ACA GGT TAC CCA
CTG CGA-39 (reverse); Prorenin, 59-CCA CCT CCG TGA TCC
T-39 (forward) and 59-GCG GAT AGT ACT GGG TGT CCA
T-39 (reverse); GAPDH, 59-ATG GGG AAG GTG AAG GTC
G-39 (forward) and 59-GGG GTC ATT GAT GGC AAC AAT A￾39 (reverse).
Transfection of siRNA
Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) specific to OAT3 (OAT3
siRNA) and AhR (AhR siRNA) were purchased from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA, USA). siRNAs specific to PRR
(PRR siRNA) and NF-kB p65 (NF-kB p65 siRNA) were obtained
from Nippon EGT (Tokyo, Japan). Lipofectamine RNA iMAX
(Invitrogen, Life Technologies, Carsbad, CA, USA) was used to
transfect siRNA into HASMCs cells according to a manufacturer’s
protocol. HASMCs were incubated with or without OAT3 siRNA
(10 nmol/L), AhR siRNA (30 nmol/L), NF-kB p65 siRNA
(10 nmol/L) or PRR siRNA (20 nmol/L) for 48 h. Protein
expressions of OAT3, AhR, NF-kB p65, and PRR were analyzed
by western blotting.
Western Blot Analysis
Serum-starved HASMCs were incubated with 250 mmol/L of
IS for the indicated time periods. Cells were pretreated with
2.5 mmol/L NAC and 10 mmol/L DPI for 30 min, before IS
stimulation for 24 h. For gene knock down experiment, HASMCs
were transfected with siRNAs (siOAT3, siPRR, sip65 and siAhR)
for 48 h, before IS stimulation. Cells were lysed in lysis buffer

(65 mmol/L Tris-HCl (PH 6.8), 3.3% sodium dodecyl sulfate
(SDS), 10% glycerol, 2.2% bromophenol blue) and were
fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE)
on polyacrylamide gels. Then, proteins were transferred to
polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes (Immobilon-P,
Millipore Bedford, MA, USA). The membranes were blocked
with 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in Tris-buffered saline
tween-20 (TBS-T) at room temperature for 1 h. After washing
with TBS-T, the membranes were treated with rabbit polyclonal
anti-PRR antibody (1:1000), rabbit monoclonal anti-prorenin
antibody (1:1000), rabbit polyclonal anti-OAT3 antibody (1:500),
rabbit polyclonal anti-NF-kB p65 antibody (1:1000), rabbit
polyclonal anti-AhR antibody (1:1000) and goat polyclonal anti￾tissue factor antibody (1:1000), respectively. Then, the membranes
were further incubated with HRP-linked secondary antibody
(1:5000) at room temperature for 1 h. After washing with TBS-T
three times, the protein expressions were visualized using the
enhanced Chemi-Lumi one system (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto,
Japan). The intensity of protein bands normalized to the amount
of a-tubulin (an internal control, 1:1000) is expressed as ratios (fold
increase) of the control value.
Statistical Analysis
Results are expressed as mean6SE. The quantitative data
among different groups were analyzed by Fisher’s protected least
significant difference (PLSD) test of one-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA). Results were considered statistically significant when P
value was ,0.05.
Results
AST-120 Supresses Aortic Expression of PRR in CKD Rats
An oral absorbent (AST-120, Kremezin, Kureha Co., Tokyo,
Japan) reduces serum levels of IS in CKD rats and patients [39].
To examine the effects of AST-120 on PRR expression in aorta,
AST-120 was orally administered to CKD rats. Laboratory
parameters of the animal study 1 were described previously [37].
Briefly, serum levels of IS were 0.00860.007 mg/dL in normal
rats, 0.5260.16 mg/dL in CKD rats, and 0.1260.02 mg/dL in
AST-120-treated CKD rats [37].
CKD rats showed significantly increased expression of PRR in
the arcuate aorta compared with normal rats (Figure 1A, B). On
the other hand, AST-120-treated CKD rats revealed significantly
reduced expression of PRR in the arcuate aorta compared with
CKD rats (Figure 1A, B).
IS Enhances Aortic Expression of PRR in Normotensive
and Hypertensive Rats
To determine the effect of IS on PRR expression in aorta, IS
was orally administered to normotensive and hypertensive rats.
Laboratory parameters of animal study 2 were reported previously
[38]. Briefly, serum levels of IS at the 32nd weeks of the study

were; 0.1060.01 mg/dL in DN rats, 0.9460.13 mg/dL in DN+
IS rats, 0.0660.01 mg/dL in DH rats, and 1.8960.26 mg/dL in
DH+IS rats [38]. Systolic blood pressure levels at the 32nd weeks
of the study were; 14363 mmHg in DN rats, 14163 mmHg in
DN+IS rats, 15865 mmHg in DH rats, and 15869 mmHg in
DH+IS rats [38].
DN+IS, DH and DH+IS rats showed significantly increased
expression levels of PRR in arcuate aorta compared with DN rats
(Figure 1C,D). Furthermore, DH+IS rats showed significantly
elevated expression level of PRR in arcuate aorta compared with
DH rats (Figure 1C,D). Taken together, IS as well as hypertension
increased PRR expression in rat aorta.
Aortic Expression of Renin/prorenin is Increased in CKD
Rats and IS-treated Rats
Immunohistochemical analysis was conducted to examine
whether IS upregulates renin/prorenin expression in the aorta of
CKD rats and IS-treated rats. Anti-renin/prorenin antibody,
which cross reacts with renin and prorenin, was used as a primary
antibody [36]. Aortic expression of renin/prorenin was signifi￾cantly increased in CKD rats compared with normal rats.
However, AST-120-treated CKD rats reduced the expression of
renin/prorenin compared with CKD rats (Figure 2A,B).
Aortic expression of renin/prorenin was significantly increased
in DN+IS and DH+IS rats compared with DN and DH rat,
respectively (Figure 2C,D). Taken together, CKD rats and IS￾administered rats showed increased expression of renin/prorenin
in the aorta.
IS Induces PRR Expression in Vascular Smooth Muscle
Cells
We confirmed the effect of IS on expression of PRR by
incubating HASMCs with IS at indicated time periods and
concentrations. IS stimulated expression of PRR mRNA and

protein in a time- and dose-dependent manner in HASMCs
(Figure 3A–D). The molecular weight of PRR protein was
39 kDa. PRR expression was examined at 24 h after incubating
with IS at different concentrations. IS at a concentration of
250 mmol/L was used for the further in-vitro study, because it is
comparable to the mean serum level of IS in hemodialysis patients
[2].
ROS, OAT3, AhR and NF-kB p65 are Involved in IS￾Induced PRR Expression in Vascular Smooth Muscle Cells
Serum-starved HASMCs were pre-incubated with 2.5 mmol/L
NAC, an antioxidant, or 10 mmol/L of DPI, an inhibitor of
NADPH oxidase, and then stimulated with 250 mmol/L IS for
24 h (Figure 4A,B). IS induces ROS production and expression of
NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX-4) in HASMCs [16,17]. Both NAC and
DPI suppressed IS-induced protein expression of PRR. Therefore,
IS upregulated PRR expression in HASMCs through ROS. IS is
transported into HASMCs by OAT3 [6]. OAT3 siRNA
suppressed IS-induced expression of PRR in HASMCs (Fig￾ure 4D), Thus, IS is taken up by OAT3, and induces PRR
expression in HASMCs.
IS was identified as an AhR agonist in human hepatocytes [40],
endothelial cells [41,42], and vascular smooth muscle cells [43].
Activation of AhR mediates IS-induced expression of MCP-1 and
tissue factor in endothelial cells [41]. IS activates NF-kB pathway
in proximal tubular cells [7] and endothelial cells [14]. We
hypothesized that IS-induced expression of PRR and prorenin is
mediated by activation of AhR and NF-kB p65. Both AhR siRNA
and NF-kB p65 siRNA suppressed IS-induced expression of PRR
(Figure 4E,F). Thus, IS induced expression of PRR through
activation of AhR and NF-kB p65 in HASMCs.
IS Induces Prorenin Expression in Vascular Smooth
Muscle Cells
Prorenin which is bound to PRR, becomes enzymatically active,
and then catalyzes angiotensinogen into Ang I. Further, prorenin￾bound PRR induces intracellular signaling [21]. However, if
prorenin does not exist, PRR could not be activated. Therefore,
we examined whether IS induces prorenin expression in
HASMCs. IS promoted expression of prorenin mRNA and
protein in HASMCs time- and dose-dependently (Figure 5A–D).
The molecular weight of prorenin was 47 kDa.
Figure 4. ROS, OAT3, AhR and NF-kB p65 are involved in IS-induced PRR expression in vascular smooth muscle cells. Serum-starved
HASMCs were pretreated with NAC (2.5 mmol/L) and DPI (10 mmol/L) for 30 min before incubation with IS (250 mmol/L) for 24 h (A,B). HASMCs were
transfected with or without OAT3 siRNA (10 nmol/L), AhR siRNA (30 nmol/L) or p65 siRNA (10 nmol/L), and serum starved for 24 h, followed by
incubation with IS (250 mmol/L) for 24 h. Cell lysates were immunoblotted using anti-OAT3, anti-AhR, anti-p65 and anti-PRR antibodies (C–F).

ROS, OAT3, AhR, and NF-kB p65 are Involved in IS￾Induced Prorenin Expression in Vascular Smooth Muscle
Cells
Both NAC and DPI suppressed stimulatory effects of IS on
prorenin expression in HASMCs (Figure 6A, B). OAT3 siRNA,
AhR siRNA and NF-kB p65 siRNA inhibited stimulatory effects
of IS on prorenin expression. (Figure 6D, E, F). Therefore, IS
induced prorenin expression in HASMCs through ROS, OAT3,
AhR and NF-kB p65.
IS-Induced PRR Activation is Involved in Vascular Smooth
Muscle Cell Proliferation
IS promotes vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation through
generation of ROS and transportation by OAT3 [33,34]. Prorenin
activates extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2, leading
to vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation, independent of Ang II
generation [26,27]. We examined whether IS-induced PRR is
involved in proliferation of HASMCs. PRR siRNA suppressed
IS-induced proliferation of HASMCs (Figure 7A). Prorenin
(20 nmol/L) increased proliferation of HASMCs, whereas PRR
siRNA suppressed prorenin-induced proliferation of HASMCs
(Figure 7B). Thus, IS induces proliferation of HASMCs via
prorenin/PRR pathway.
IS-Induced PRR Activation is Involved in Tissue Factor
Expression in Vascular Smooth Muscle Cells
IS is positively associated with tissue factor expression in CKD
[35,42]. The present study revealed that both IS and prorenin
enhanced tissue factor protein expression in HASMCs. PRR
siRNA suppressed IS-induced and prorenin-induced tissue factor
expression in HASMCs (Figure 7D,E). Thus, IS induces tissue
factor expression via prorenin/PRR pathway in HASMCs.
Discussion
The novel findings of the present study are; 1) Aortic expression

AST-120 reduced their expression; 2) IS increased aortic
expression of PRR and prorenin/renin in rats; 3) IS increased
expression of PRR and prorenin through OAT3, ROS, AhR and
NF-kB in vascular smooth muscle cells; 4) IS-induced PRR
activation is involved in vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation;
5) IS-induced PRR activation is involved in tissue factor expression
in vascular smooth muscle cells. Taken together, IS upregulates
aortic expression of prorenin/PRR in vascular smooth muscle cells
through OAT3-mediated uptake, ROS production, and activation
of AhR and NF-kB p65. IS-induced activation of PRR is involved
in cell proliferation and tissue factor expression in vascular smooth
muscle cells.
We observed aortic expression of renin/prorenin in CKD rats
and IS-administered rats. Further, IS induced prorenin expression
in vascular smooth muscle cells. However, previous data
demonstrated that vascular renin originates largely if not
completely in the kidney [44,45], and that the bulk of vascular
renin is taken up from the circulation [46,47]. Taken together, our
observation might suggest that aortic expression of prorenin is
induced in CKD rats and IS-induced rats.
ROS induced upregulation of PRR in diabetic rat kidneys [48].
IS induces ROS generation by increasing NADPH oxidase NOX￾4 and through OAT3-mediated uptake in HASMCs [16,17]. The
present study revealed that NAC, DPI, and OAT3 siRNA
suppressed IS-induced expression of PRR and prorenin in
HASMCs. Thus, IS induced expression of PRR and prorenin
through OAT3-mediated uptake and ROS production.
IS was identified as a potent endogenous ligand for AhR
[40,41]. IS induces activation and translocation of AhR in
endothelial cells [41]. IS-induced activation of AhR upregulates
NF-kB p65 expression in vascular smooth muscle cells (unpub￾lished data). In the present study, both AhR siRNA and NF-kB
p65 siRNA suppressed IS-induced expression of PRR and
prorenin. Thus, IS-induced activation of AhR/NF-kB p65
pathway simulates the expression of PRR and prorenin in vascular
smooth muscle cells.
Vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation is a key event in the
pathogenesis of vascular complications. Binding of PRR with
prorenin induced vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation
via activation of ERK1/2, independent of angiotensin II
Figure 6. ROS, OAT3, AhR, and NF-kB p65 are involved in IS-induced prorenin expression in vascular smooth muscle cells. Serum

HASMCs were transfected with or without OAT3 siRNA (10 nmol/L), AhR siRNA (30 nmol/L) or p65 siRNA (10 nmol/L), and serum starved for 24 h,
followed by incubation with IS (250 mmol/L) for 24 h. Cell lysates were immunoblotted using anti-OAT3, anti-AhR, anti-p65 and anti-prorenin
antibodies (C–F). Mean6SE (n = 3). *p,0.05, **p,0.01 vs untreated group, #p,0.01 vs IS-treated group. Ctrl: control.

[21,22,26,27]. IS promoted aortic wall thickening and aortic
calcification in hypertensive rats [14]. IS stimulated vascular
smooth muscle cell proliferation through ROS production [22],
and directly activated ERK1/2 [21]. In the present study, PRR
siRNA suppressed both IS-induced and prorenin-induced cell
proliferation in HASMCs. Thus, PRR is involved in IS-induced
vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation.
Tissue factor is a mediator of injury-related thrombosis, and is
elevated in the serum of advanced CKD patients. IS upregulates
tissue factor expression in vascular smooth muscle cells [35] and
endothelial cells [42]. The present study demonstrated that PRR
siRNA suppressed IS-induced upregulation of TF expression in
HASMCs. Thus, PRR is involved in IS-induced tissue factor
expression in HASMCs. Taken together, IS-induced activation of
prorenin-PRR pathway plays an important role in not only
vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation but also tissue factor
expression.
