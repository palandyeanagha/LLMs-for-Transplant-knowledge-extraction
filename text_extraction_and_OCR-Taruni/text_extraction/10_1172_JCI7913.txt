Introduction
Hematopoietic cell transplantation has yet to reach its
full potential clinically, primarily because of the severe
toxicities associated with the current standard prepara￾tive regimens for bone marrow transplantation (BMT).
For many patients with hemoglobinopathies, including
sickle cell disease and thalassemia, BMT offers the only
hope of a cure. For organ-transplant recipients, tolerance
induced by BMT would eliminate the need for and avoid
the complications of chronic immunosuppression. In
this laboratory we have developed methods for achieving
transplantation tolerance in mice through the estab￾lishment of mixed bone marrow chimerism, a state in
which both host and donor elements coexist in the lym￾phohematopoietic tissues of the recipient (1–3). Mixed
chimerism has many potential advantages over fully
allogeneic chimerism. These advantages include: (a) the
ability to achieve mixed chimerism with less toxic prepar￾ative regimens (3–6); (b) the ability to cross MHC barri￾ers; (c) full immunocompetence, even across MHC bar￾riers (7, 8); and (d) a reduced likelihood of graft versus
host disease (GvHD) (9–11).
To apply the mixed chimerism approach to patients,
large-animal models are needed, both to understand
the mechanism of the treatment and to optimize the
treatment protocol. Partially inbred miniature swine
have been developed in this laboratory as a large-ani￾mal, preclinical model for studies of transplantation
biology and are very similar to humans in many param￾eters related to BMT (12–14). One significant obstacle
to achieving mixed chimerism without myeloablation
in large animals has been the lack of effective in vivo T
cell–depleting reagents. Previous studies from our lab￾oratory have shown that without T-cell depletion, bone
marrow engraftment could not be achieved in minia￾ture swine unless doses of whole-body irradiation
(WBI) exceeded 1000 cGy (13–15). We have recently
described the generation of a swine CD3 immunotox￾in, pCD3-CRM9, which is extremely effective at deplet￾ing mature T cells from the peripheral blood (PB),
lymph node, and thymus of miniature swine (16). We
have also shown recently that cytokine mobilization
and apheresis of miniature swine blood allows the col￾lection of peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) capable
of full hematopoietic reconstitution (manuscript sub￾mitted for publication, C. Colby, Bone Marrow Trans￾plantation Service, Massachusetts General Hospital,
Boston, Massachusetts, USA). In this report, we test
whether stable mixed chimerism and donor-specific
tolerance can be established in miniature swine fol￾lowing BMC/PBSC transplantation (BMC/PBSCT)
using nonmyeloablative conditioning regimens.

Bone marrow transplantation (BMT) has considerable potential for the treatment of malignancies,
hemoglobinopathies, and autoimmune diseases, as well as the induction of transplantation allograft
tolerance. Toxicities associated with standard preparative regimens for bone marrow transplantation,
however, make this approach unacceptable for all but the most severe of these clinical situations. Here,
we demonstrate that stable mixed hematopoietic cell chimerism and donor-specific tolerance can be
established in miniature swine, using a relatively mild, non-myeloablative preparative regimen. We
conditioned recipient swine with whole-body and thymic irradiation, and we depleted their T-cells by
CD3 immunotoxin-treatment. Infusion of either bone marrow cells or cytokine-mobilized peripher￾al blood stem cells from leukocyte antigen-matched animals resulted in stable mixed chimerism, as
detected by flow cytometry in the peripheral blood, thymus, and bone marrow, without any clinical
evidence of graft-versus-host disease (GvHD). Long-term acceptance of donor skin and consistent
rejection of third-party skin indicated that the recipients had developed donor-specific tolerance.

Methods
Animals. Transplant donors and recipients were select￾ed from our herd of partially inbred Massachusetts
General Hospital (MGH) miniature swine. The
immunogenetic characteristics of this herd and intra￾MHC recombinant haplotypes have been described
previously (17, 18). Two indwelling central catheters
were placed in stem cell donor animals in the right and
left external jugular veins, extending well into the supe￾rior vena cava. A central catheter was also placed in
recipient animals to facilitate cell infusion and fre￾quent blood sampling. The catheters were tunneled
subcutaneously, exiting the skin dorsally on the neck.
Bone marrow harvest and infusion. Marrow was harvest￾ed with curettes from the proximal humeri and tibiae,
from the distal femora, and, if necessary, from the ver￾tebrae following exsanguination of the donor animal.
After harvest, the marrow was minced, resuspended in
RPMI-1640 with 10 µg DNase, and filtered through
sterile nylon mesh before centrifugation. Red blood
cells (RBCs) were lysed with ACK buffer (Bio Whittak￾er, Walkersville, Maryland, USA), and the preparation
was washed with HBSS with Ca2+ (GIBCO BRL,
Gaithersburg, Maryland, USA). The marrow was
administered slowly at a cell concentration of 108/mL
by catheter.
PBSC collection. A stem cell mobilizing regimen con￾sisting of daily treatments with recombinant porcine
stem cell factor (pSCF; 100 µg/kg) in combination with
recombinant porcine–IL-3 (pIL-3; 100 µg/kg), both from
BioTransplant (BTI), Boston Massachusetts, USA; with
or without 10 µg/kg recombinant human G-CSF (rhu
G-CSF; Amgen, Boulder, Colorado, USA), was adminis￾tered subcutaneously. Collection of PBSC was achieved
by leukapheresis (COBE Spectra Apheresis System, Lake￾wood, Colorado, USA) beginning on day 5 of cytokine
therapy and continuing daily until sufficient numbers
of cells were collected. PBSC, either fresh or frozen and
quickly thawed, were adjusted to a concentration of 2.0
× 108/mL, and the appropriate volume was infused by
catheter over a 15- to 20-minute period. PBSC were
administered beginning on day 0.
Irradiation. WBI was administered on days –4 and –3.
Animals were placed in Plexiglas cages and 150 cGy mid￾line WBI was administered at 20 cGy/min from a cobalt
60 source. Twenty-four hours later the animals received
a second identical dose of WBI. Thymic irradiation was
administered on day –2. Animals received intravenous
telazol (0.15 mg/kg) for sedation and were then placed
in the supine position on a plastic cradle and secured
into position. Irradiation was administered to a field
encompassing the thymus, defined by an x-axis, includ￾ing the width of the jaw, and a y-axis, including the dis￾tance from the top of the sternum to the temporo￾mandibular joint. The defined field was irradiated with
700 cGy from a cobalt irradiator source at a rate of 175
cGy/min.
Recipient T-cell depletion. T-cell depletion was achieved
using the newly described diphtheria toxin–based
swine CD3 immunotoxin, pCD3-CRM9 (16), made by
conjugating the diphtheria toxin binding site mutant,
CRM9, to the anti-porcine CD3 mAb, 898H2-6-15. On
day –2, 0.05 mg/kg pCD3-CRM9 was administered
intravenously to recipient animals.
CyA treatment. CyA (Sandimmune, oral solution;
Novartis Pharmaceutics, Basel, Switzerland) was admin￾istered through a gastric tube at 30 mg/kg per day in
divided doses from day –1 to day 30.
Antibodies and flow cytometry. The following antibodies
were used to monitor depletion and recovery of cell pop￾ulations in the pig by flow cytometry after pCD3-CRM9
administration and PBSC infusion: CD1 76-7-4 BALB/c
IgG2aK (19); CD3 898H2-6-15 C3H/HEJ IgG2aK (20);
CD3a BB23-8E6 IgG1, and CD5 BB6-9G12 IgG1 pro￾vided by Mark Pescovitz, Indiana University, Blooming￾ton, Indiana, USA (21). Flow cytometry was performed
using a Becton Dickinson FACScan (San Jose, California,
USA). Unseparated heparinized PB was distributed into
staining tubes (Falcon 2054) at 100 µL/tube and washed
twice using 2 mL flow cytometry buffer (HBSS contain￾ing Ca2+ and Mg2+/0.1% BSA/0.1% NaN3). Cells were
stained with optimal concentrations of the primary
mouse anti-pig mAb (either unconjugated or FITC-con￾jugated) for 30 minutes at room temperature. For indi￾rect staining, goat anti-mouse IgG (heavy and light chain
specific) FITC (GAMF; Sigma Immunochemicals, St.
Louis, Missouri, USA) was added for an additional 30
minutes at room temperature. For detection of
immunotoxin-coated cells, second-step reagent alone
was added. To determine the percentage of donor cells
among PB cell populations, PB was incubated with the
pig monocyte/granulocyte-specific FITC-conjugated
SWC3a mAb 74-22-15 (BALB/c, IgG1K) (22) together
with the donor-specific biotin-conjugated 1038H-10-9
(B10.PD1, IgMK) mAb specific for swine PAA (pig allel￾ic antigen) (23) followed by streptavidin phycoerythrin
(PESA; PharMingen, San Diego, California, USA). RBC
were lysed and the cells were fixed using FACS lysing
solution (Becton Dickinson) before acquisition. Data
were analyzed using Winlist list mode analysis software
(Verity Software House, Topsham, Maine, USA).
Preparation of lymphoid cell suspensions for flow cytometry.
Biopsy samples of mesenteric lymph node and thymus
were placed in Petri dishes containing flow cytometry
buffer (HBSS containing 0.1% BSA and 0.1% NaN3).
Cell suspensions were prepared by grinding the tissue
between the frosted ends of 2 slides until only fibrous
tissue remained. The cells were then passed through
FACS mesh before cell counting and staining for flow
cytometry. For flow cytometric staining, cells were dis￾tributed into tubes at 106 cells/tube. Staining was as
described above, except no FACS lysing solution was
added. Propidium iodide was added immediately
before acquisition to exclude dead cells.
Skin grafts. Skin grafts were performed by techniques
published previously (24). Briefly, split-thickness skin
was harvested from the donor and placed on a deep
split-thickness bed on the recipient’s dorsal thorax.

Grafts were examined daily until rejection occurred.
Rejection was determined macroscopically and defined
as diffuse cyanosis and induration of the graft.
Results
Optimizing the dosage and timing of pCD3-CRM9 adminis￾tration to allow stable hematopoietic cell engraftment in minia￾ture swine. Table 1 summarizes all animals treated with
this nonmyeloablative protocol. The dosage and tim￾ing of pCD3-CRM9 administration was optimized to
allow engraftment in these animals with minimal tox￾icity. The initial dosing regimen (given to animal
12534) was chosen based on previous experience using
this immunotoxin to deplete swine T cells in vivo with￾out any other conditioning. Maximal depletion
occurred 2 days following the second dose when pCD3-
CRM9 was administered in 2 split doses of 0.1 mg/kg,
each 2 days apart (16).
Although T-cell depletion was best with this dosage
and timing, the risk of complications because of periph￾eral polyneuropathy caused by the toxin component of
the immunotoxin was increased when doses of 0.1
mg/kg or greater were used. Animal 12534 was given 2
doses of 0.05 mg/kg pCD3-CRM9 on days 0 and 2, for
a total dose of 0.1 mg/kg. This animal developed respi￾ratory complications because of immunotoxin-induced
polyneuropathy and was sacrificed on day 33. The dose
of pCD3-CRM9 was therefore reduced to 0.05 mg/kg in
1 dose to avoid neurotoxicity in miniature swine. Ani￾mal 12674 received 1 dose of 0.05 mg/kg pCD3-CRM9
12 hours before bone marrow cell infusion. No neu￾ropathy developed, but this animal failed to stabilize
clinically and had severe platelet (PLT) consumption.
Chimerism was lost by 40 days after BMT. All subse￾quent animals were given 1 dose of 0.05 mg/kg pCD3-
CRM9 48 hours before PBSC infusion to allow maximal
host T-cell depletion before donor cell infusion. All
PBSC-transplanted animals receiving 0.05 mg/kg
pCD3-CRM9 on day 2 (4/4) successfully engrafted with
no complications of neuropathy. Figure 1 is a schemat￾ic diagram of this nonmyeloablative preparative regi￾men for hematopoietic cell transplantation, which was
used in all subsequently transplanted animals. Two
PBSC-transplanted animals were treated with a 30-day
course of CyA and 2 additional animals were treated
with the same preparative regimen without CyA (Table
1). All PBSC-transplanted animals (4/4) successfully
engrafted regardless of whether or not they were given
a short course of CyA. The addition of CyA to this non￾myeloablative regimen was not necessary, therefore, for
stable engraftment across minor histocompatibility bar￾riers in miniature swine.
Effect of the preparative regimen on PB T-cell depletion. T￾cell depletion was monitored daily by FACS from the
first day of WBI until infusion of donor cells on day 0
in all animals, except animal 12534. Figure 2a shows
the absolute number of T cells remaining in the PB
each day, as determined by staining with 2 different T￾cell specific mAbs, BB23-8E6 (CD3a) and BB6-9G12
(CD5) and by multiplying the percentage of positive
cells by the white blood cell count as determined by
complete blood cell count. A comparison was made of
animals receiving pCD3-CRM9 and 1 control animal
(animal 13475) receiving an identical conditioning reg￾imen without pCD3-CRM9. In all animals treated with
immunotoxin, T-cell numbers reached less than 0.2%
of the pretreatment level in the PB by day 0. Absolute
numbers of T cells remaining in PB on day 0 ranged
from 4 (animal 13235) to 112 (animal 12674) T cells
per microliter of blood (Figure 2b). All remaining T
cells were coated with immunotoxin on day 0 as detect￾ed by staining with a FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse
Ig-specific reagent (data not shown). The control ani￾mal without pCD3-CRM9 had 30- to 150-fold more T
cells remaining in the PB (593 T cells/µL) than suc￾The Journal of Clinical Investigation | January 2000 | Volume 105 | Number 2 175

(4–20 T cells/µL).
WBC and PLT level of animals undergoing nonmyeloablative
regimen. Figure 3 shows the WBC and PLT level of ani￾mals treated with the nonmyeloablative preparative reg￾imen for hematopoietic cell transplantation. The WBC
and PLT level of animals given BMT (animals 12534 and
12674) is shown separately from that of those receiving
PBSCT (animals 13235, 13379, 12743, 13131). WBC
dropped below 1000/µL within 1 week of the start of the
preparative regimen for all animals except animal 13131
(Figure 3a), then recovered within 2 to 3 weeks after
transplant in most animals. PLT dropped below
100,000/µL in the first 3 weeks and recovered in most
animals within 2 to 3 weeks (Figure 3b). Multiple PLT
infusions were necessary during the time of low PLT and
cytopenia. Animal 12674 never fully stabilized clinically
and was sacrificed on day 40 because of severe PLT con￾sumption and failure to recover WBC.
Detection of multilineage chimerism in PB. Chimerism was
detected by flow cytometry using our pig allelic antigen
(PAA) mAb, which recognizes a PAA present on swine
leukocytes (23). Donor and recipient animals were
selected as PAA+ and PAA–, respectively, to facilitate
chimerism detection. Figure 4 shows the percentage of
donor cells detected in the PB following either BMT
(Figure 4a) or PBSCT (Figure 4b). Five out of 6 animals
successfully engrafted with the protocol in Table 1
showed high levels of myeloid chimerism. Most animals
showed initially low levels of lymphoid chimerism, but
this gradually increased over time (Figure 4b). Although
the proportion of donor myeloid cells appears to
decrease slightly over the first 200 days, myeloid
chimerism remains stable long-term, as shown for ani￾mal 13235 and animal 13131 in Figure 4b. The 1 animal
that failed to engraft (animal 12674) showed very poor
T-cell depletion compared with the other animals. Ani￾mal 12674 had 112 T cells remaining per microliter of
blood, whereas all 4 successfully engrafted animals had
only 4–20 T cells/µL remaining on day 0. The unstable
clinical course observed in animal 12674 may have been
a consequence of an host-versus-graft reaction resulting
in graft rejection, possibly combined with a GvHD reac￾tion leading to failure of host hematopoietic recovery
(see discussion). All other animals recovered without
any evidence of GvHD. Although the level of T-cell
depletion was not determined for animal 12534, we can
presume that it was very good because the dose of
pCD3-CRM9 was twice that used in all of the other ani￾mals. Unlike all other engrafted animals in this regimen,
animal 13131 showed a high percentage of donor cells
in the lymphocyte lineage even at the earliest time point
during the first week.
Detection of a high level of donor cell chimerism in the thy￾mus of successfully engrafted animals. The level of thymic
chimerism was determined by FACS staining of thy￾mocyte suspensions prepared from thymic biopsy tis￾sue using the donor-specific PAA mAb. Figure 5 shows
the percentage of PAA+ donor cells detected in the thy￾mus at times of thymic biopsy for each animal. All ani￾mals except 12674 had very high levels of chimerism
detected in the thymus. The thymic chimerism level
was consistent with the level of myeloid chimerism in
each animal and may reflect the level of hematopoietic
progenitor and stem cell engraftment. Thymocyte
development appeared phenotypically normal follow￾ing mixed chimerism establishment, and donor cells
could be detected in thymocytes at all stages of devel￾opment (Figure 6, a and b). Figure 6a, parts 1,2, and 3,
show, respectively, forward scatter (FSC) versus CD1,
FSC versus CD3, and FSC versus PAA profiles before
and 72 days after PBSCT in animal 13235. The distri￾bution of immature and mature thymocyte popula￾tions was identical before and after transplantation
(Figure 6a, parts 1 and 2). Donor-specific PAA could be
detected in all size fractions of thymocytes after, but
not before PBSCT (Figure 6a, part 3). Figure 6b con￾firms that donor PAA+ thymocytes were present among
the immature CD1-positive thymocytes (upper graph,
quadrant 2), and among the mature CD3-high thymo￾cytes (lower graph, quadrant 2). A high level of donor
cell chimerism (> 20% PAA+) could also be detected in
the bone marrow of all successfully engrafted animals
(data not shown). However, the actual level of bone
marrow chimerism is difficult to quantify in this
model, because PAA is not expressed on 100% of bone
marrow cells in naïve PAA+ animals as it is in all other
lymphoid tissues (23).
Prolongation of donor skin graft survival times in mixed
chimeric animals. Skin grafts were placed on the four
long-term stable mixed chimeras (animals 13235,
13379, 12743, and 13131) at least 60 days after PBSCT.

The day of rejection for skin grafts is shown in Table
2. All animals showed either indefinite acceptance or
significant prolongation of donor skin relative to
third-party swine leukocyte antigen–matched (SLA￾matched) control skin. Figure 7 shows skin graft
appearances for animal 13379, which showed the
smallest difference in rejection times of control versus
donor skin grafts. Donor skin (Figure 7b) was com￾pletely intact with no significant difference from self
skin (Figure 7a) at 41 days after skin grafting and
remained intact up to 50 days, whereas both third￾party SLA-matched skin grafts (Figure 7, c and d) were
completely rejected by day 41 (Figure 7). Slight pro￾longation of SLA-matched third-party skin grafts was
observed in 3 out of 4 animals receiving the nonmye￾loablative regimen, regardless of whether or not CyA
was included in the regimen (Table 2). CyA levels were
undetectable in all animals at the time of skin grafting.
One of 2 animals receiving the nonmyeloablative reg￾imen without CyA rejected third-party SLA-matched
skin promptly at the expected time of 10 days. In one
animal on which both third-party SLA-matched and
SLA-mismatched skin was placed, the SLA-mis￾matched skin was rejected promptly as expected (10
days), whereas the SLA-matched skin graft survival
was slightly prolonged (24 days).
Discussion
In this report, we demonstrate, we believe for the first
time, the successful establishment of stable mixed
chimerism and donor-specific tolerance in miniature
swine. Chimerism was established using a relatively
mild nonmyeloablative conditioning regimen, similar
to that developed initially in rodents. To extend treat￾ment regimens developed in rodents to the clinic, large￾animal models are needed, both to understand the
mechanism and to optimize the treatment protocol. A
critical component for successful engraftment using
the nonmyeloablative regimen developed in rodents is
effective T-cell depletion of the recipient (25, 26). Com￾plete and specific T-cell depletion in large animals,
however, has been much more difficult to achieve (27,
28). In this report, we describe the successful establish￾ment of stable mixed chimerism in miniature swine
using a nonmyeloablative preparative regimen that
includes T-cell depletion with the newly described
immunotoxin, pCD3-CRM9 (16). The availability of
our newly described PAA mAb, which is capable of dis￾tinguishing a non-MHC allelic marker, PAA, present on

pig leukocytes, greatly facilitates chimerism detection
in this model (23).
Although we observed some neurotoxicity in minia￾ture swine when using the diphtheria-based immuno￾toxin at doses of 0.1 mg/kg or greater, we were able to
overcome this problem by using lower doses. It is pos￾sible that irradiation given in this protocol may
increase the risk of neuropathy in miniature swine. No
neuropathy was observed in animal 12674 following
the reduction to 1 dose of 0.05 mg/kg pCD3-CRM9 12
hours before donor bone marrow infusion. This animal
failed to engraft, however, and never fully stabilized
clinically. Administration of pCD3-CRM9 too close to
BMT may have resulted in insufficient host T-cell
depletion by day 0 and also may have led to partial in
vivo T-cell depletion of donor T cells, possibly con￾tributing to HvGD and the animal’s clinical instabili￾ty. Based on our experience using this immunotoxin in
combination with WBI and thymic irradiation (TI;
Table 1), we have determined that a dose of 0.05 mg/kg
pCD3-CRM9 administered 2 days before PBSC trans￾plantation allows sufficient T-cell depletion in this pro￾tocol to enable successful engraftment with minimal
toxicity. It should be pointed out that peripheral neu￾ropathy has never been observed in rhesus monkeys
receiving anti-rhesus CD3-CRM9 at doses ranging
between 0.13–0.20 mg/kg (29–32).
Initial attempts at establishing mixed chimerism in
miniature swine using the newly developed swine T
cell–depleting reagent pCD3-CRM9 were made using
bone marrow as the donor stem cell source. With the
successful development of PBSC technology in our lab￾oratory, we are now consistently using cytokine-mobi￾lized PBSC as a source of donor hematopoietic cells for
transplantation. Two major advantages of using PBSC
over BM as the donor cell source are that the donor can

be kept alive for future skin/organ transplantation into
the recipient and that very large numbers of donor
hematopoietic cells can be collected by multiple leuka￾pheresis procedures.
Stable mixed chimerism has been demonstrated after
bone marrow transplants in lethally and sublethally
irradiated DLA-identical littermate dogs (33, 34). The
addition of immunosuppressive drugs, including CyA,
following transplantation was determined to be neces￾sary to maintain stable chimerism in the dog model,
which did not include recipient T-cell depletion or TI.
Our studies using miniature swine demonstrate that
CyA administration is not necessary for successful
engraftment across minor histocompatibility barriers.
The addition of pCD3-CRM9 to the regimen in minia￾ture swine may provide sufficient T-cell depletion to
allow engraftment without additional immunosup￾pression. Although these studies show that CyA admin￾istration is not necessary for successful engraftment
across minor histocompatibility barriers in miniature
swine, our preliminary studies suggest that CyA may
still be valuable for GvHD prophylaxis when MHC bar￾riers are crossed.
These studies in miniature swine provide the first evi￾dence for donor-specific tolerance induced by the
mixed chimerism approach in a large-animal model.
Donor skin graft survival was significantly prolonged
relative to third-party SLA-matched and SLA-mis￾matched skin. The eventual rejection of donor skin in
some tolerant animals is likely because of skin-specific
antigens, because these animals nevertheless main￾tained peripheral and thymic mixed chimerism after
donor skin graft rejection. Despite the induction of tol￾erance by donor PBSC, it is possible that skin-specific
antigens for which tolerance had not been induced in
the recipient by PBSC were present on the donor skin
graft. Animal 13131, tested in the same way, showed
permanent donor skin survival. These data are consis￾tent with what is known about skin-specific antigens
in mice (35–37). The slight prolongation of third-party
SLA-matched skin in 3 of 4 animals may be due to shar￾ing of minor histocompatibility antigens between the
PBSC donor and/or recipient and the SLA-matched
skin graft donors. Another possibility is that this non￾myeloablative regimen causes some degree of immuno￾incompetence, resulting in slight prolongation of
minor-mismatched skin, but still allowing normal
rejection of SLA-mismatched skin. In 2 of the 3 animals
that showed delayed rejection of third-party skin,
donor-specific tolerance was clearly demonstrated,
through indefinite donor skin graft survival (13131) or
through consistent donor-specific hyporesponsiveness
as assessed in vitro by cell-mediated lympholysis (CML)
assays, even after rejection of donor skin (13379). These
data will be presented in a subsequent article on the
subject of skin-specific antigens in miniature swine (Y.
Fuchimoto, manuscript in preparation).
Three of 4 animals showed a delayed increase in donor
cell chimerism among the lymphocyte lineage during
the first 2–3 months, compared with the high level of
chimerism detected in the thymus at the time of the ear￾liest biopsy (3–4 weeks). Consistent with the percentage
of chimerism as shown in Figure 4b, the absolute num￾ber of donor lymphocytes present in the PB does not
increase significantly until 30–60 days following trans￾plantation (data not shown). These data suggest that it
takes approximately 30–60 days for the thymus to
regenerate and start functioning following TI and T-cell
depletion. The existence of host-type lymphocytes in the
PB during this time is most likely because of an expan￾sion of residual mature host T cells remaining after con￾ditioning, rather than recent emigration from the thy￾mus. The donor cell product infused into the 1 animal
with an immediate high level of lymphoid chimerism
(animal 13131) had a very high percentage of T cells
(65%) compared with that found in the products
infused into the other 3 animals (15–20%) (data not
shown). Persistence of mature donor T cells from the
PBSC inoculum may explain the early high level of lym￾phoid chimerism detected in this animal.
Although the relative percentage of donor cells among
the myeloid populations decreased slowly over the first
200 days in the 2 long-term animals, this level has now
remained stable for at least 150 days. We do not believe
that this decrease was because of chronic rejection, but
rather because of a slow approach to equilibrium,
because the animals remained tolerant to the donors
(data to be presented in a future communication). Thus,
for example, animal 13131, which showed the greatest
proportional decline in myeloid chimerism, has subse￾quently accepted a heart transplant from the PBSC
donor for over 300 days without any immunosuppres￾sion (J. Madsen, personal communication).
In this paper, we have demonstrated, we believe for the
first time, the establishment of stable multilineage
mixed chimerism and tolerance in miniature swine. The
ability to achieve mixed chimerism and tolerance with￾The Journal of Clinical Investigation | January 2000 | Volume 105 | Number 2 179

out myeloablation makes this an attractive protocol for
potential clinical application. The relatively mild prepar￾ative regimen should make this approach appropriate
for the treatment of patients with nonmalignant dis￾eases, such as hemoglobinopathies, as well as for the
induction of tolerance for organ transplantation, avoid￾ing the need for chronic immunosuppression. Immedi￾ate clinical applications for this mixed chimerism
approach include establishment of chimerism from an
HLA-matched sibling as treatment of a nonmalignant
disease and kidney transplantation following chimerism
establishment from an HLA-matched living related
donor. Although a slightly increased cancer risk has long
been associated with exposure to irradiation (38, 39), the
benefits of avoiding long-term immunosuppression are
likely to outweigh the risk of cancer because of low-dose
WBI in this model. Future challenges include the elimi￾nation of WBI in this protocol, the use of MHC-mis￾matched donors, and the development of a protocol
suitable for use in cadaveric organ recipients. Experi￾ments are currently in progress in our laboratory to
establish mixed chimerism across MHC barriers and to
reduce toxicity of the protocol even further by eliminat￾ing WBI. These experiments will be the subject of a sub￾sequent article.
