Strain vessel hypothesis: a viewpoint for linkage
of albuminuria and cerebro-cardiovascular risk
Sadayoshi Ito, Tasuku Nagasawa, Michiaki Abe and Takefumi Mori
Albuminuria is closely associated with stroke and cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) as well as the salt sensitivity of blood pressure
(BP). Although albuminuria may reflect generalized endothelial dysfunction, there may be more specific hemodynamic
mechanisms underlying these associations. Cerebral hemorrhage and infarction occur most frequently in the area of small
perforating arteries that are exposed to high pressure and that have to maintain strong vascular tone in order to provide large
pressure gradients from the parent vessels to the capillaries. Analogous to the perforating arteries are the glomerular afferent
arterioles of the juxtamedullary nephrons. Hypertensive vascular damage occurs first and more severely in the juxtamedullary
glomeruli. Therefore, albuminuria may be an early sign of vascular damages imposed on ‘strain vessels’ such as perforating
arteries and juxtamedullary afferent arterioles. Coronary circulation also occurs under unique hemodynamic conditions, in which
the entire epicardial segments are exposed to very high pressure with little flow during systolic phases. From the evolutionary
point of view, we speculate that such circulatory systems in the vital organs are mandatory for survival under the danger of
hypoperfusion due to difficult access to salt and water as well as high risks of wound injuries. In addition, albuminuria would
indicate an impairment of renal medullary circulation, downstream from the juxtamedullary glomeruli, and therefore an impaired
pressure natriuresis, which would lead to salt sensitivity of BP. Our ‘strain vessel hypothesis’ may explain why hypertension and
diabetes, unforeseen in the concept of evolution, preferentially affect vital organs such as the brain, heart and kidney.

INTRODUCTION
Chronic kidney disease (CKD), defined by reduced glomerular filtra￾tion rate (GFR) (o60 ml min1) and/or the presence of renal damages
such as microalbuminuria, is a significant threat for public health in
modern societies.1 Recent epidemiological studies have shown that
CKD is a significant risk for cardiovascular events independently of
classic risk factors such as hypertension, dyslipidemia and diabetes.2–4
The mechanisms by which CKD increases the risk of cardiovascular
events are currently under intensive investigation. Among the various
components of CKD, microalbuminuria is of particular interest,
because it is a significant risk factor not only in diabetic and
hypertensive subjects but also in the general population.2,5–8 Micro￾albuminuria is also closely associated with the salt sensitivity of blood
pressure (BP), and the salt sensitivity is an independent risk factor
for cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) even in normotensive subjects.9
Studies have now shown that albuminuria even within the normal
range is associated with higher incidence and prevalence of stroke and
CVDs.10,11 However, despite the clear associations with albuminuria
and cardiovascular events, the pathophysiological mechanisms under￾lying these events are largely unknown. Here, we propose ‘the strain
vessel hypothesis’ as a possible mechanism for cerebro-cardio-renal
connections. Our hypothesis takes into account the anatomical and
functional characteristics of the microvasculature of the vital organs,
such as the brain, heart and kidney.
ALBUMINURIA AND CEREBRO-CARDIOVASCULAR RISK
In 1984, Mogensen reported that microalbuminuria predicted clinical
proteinuria and early mortality in type 2 diabetes.12 Since then, many
cross-sectional and longitudinal studies have shown that albuminuria
is closely associated with the prevalence and incidence of CVDs, and is
also an adverse prognostic indicator in diabetic and non-diabetic
populations. Albuminuria has been shown to cluster with a number of
risk factors, including hypertension, dyslipidemia, renal dysfunction,
hyperhomocysteinemia and various inflammatory and oxidative stress
markers.13,14 Even after adjustment of these factors, albuminuria is
found to be an independent predictor for adverse cardiovascular
events, and this risk increases in a continuous fashion with the degree
of albuminuria.11 For example, the Multiple Risk Factor Intervention
Trial showed that proteinuria is a risk factor for CVD mortality
over 10 years of follow-up.15 Wada et al.
8 performed brain magnetic
resonance imaging in 651 elderly subjects and found that the level
of albuminuria was associated with cerebral small vessel disease,

independently of other cerebrovascular risk factors such as diabetes,
hypertension and dyslipidemia. In the Hypertension Outcome Pre￾vention and Evaluation study, increased levels of albuminuria even
within the normal range were found to be associated with higher
cardiovascular events in either diabetic or non-diabetic individuals.16
In addition, the association between microalbuminuria and CVDs has
been shown not only in diabetic and hypertensive populations but also
in apparently healthy subjects.5,17 Furthermore, recent clinical trials
have shown that reduction of albuminuria is significantly related to
improved outcomes in albuminuric subjects.2,18,19 Thus, the clinical
significance of albuminuria is clearly established, and various guide￾lines for the management of hypertension list albuminuria as a risk
factor or a sign of renal damage. Interestingly, the 2007 ESH/ESC
guidelines state that the term ‘microalbuminuria’ may be misleading
and also falsely suggests a minor damage.20
ALBUMINURIA AND ENDOTHELIAL DYSFUNCTION
The mechanisms of the association between albuminuria and CVDs
are still largely unknown and are a focus of intensive research and
debate.21–23 It has been suggested that albuminuria not only reflects
glomerular damage, but also is a sensitive indicator of generalized
endothelial dysfunction and capillary vasculopathy that leads to
penetration of atherosclerotic lipoproteins into the arterial walls.24–
26 Although albuminuria is associated with endothelial dysfunction in
systemic circulation,26 the mechanism for this association remains
unclear. Whether the endothelial dysfunction in general circulation
can be deduced from the presence of albuminuria is an issue of
considerable debate, because glomerular endothelial cells are quite
distinct from those of general circulation. Normally, the endothelial
cells of the glomerulus may not be the major barrier for albumin, but
the basement membrane and podocytes are the predominant deter￾minant of albumin leakage into the urine.27,28 Thus, endothelial
dysfunction of the glomerulus alone may not cause albuminuria
unless it affects the functions of the basement membrane or podo￾cytes.29,30 This issue is particularly pertinent in the absence of systemic
hypertension. Why does the presence of albuminuria even within the
normal range confer a significant cardiovascular risk in the normo￾tensive and apparently healthy subjects?
NEPHRON HETEROGENEITIES OF HYPERTENSIVE RENAL
DAMAGE
It is well known that hypertension causes renal injury. However, it is
not widely recognized that at least in certain types of hypertension
considerable heterogeneities exist among different nephron popula￾tions.31–34 Specifically, tissue injury is most obvious in the juxtame￾dullary region and outer medulla in spontaneously hypertensive rats
(SHRs),31 Dahl salt-sensitive hypertensive rats,32 renovascular hyper￾tension33 and angiotensin II (Ang II)-induced hypertension.34 In
addition, it has been shown that in SHRs glomerular lesions first
appear predominantly in the juxtamedullary nephrons and then extend
toward more superficial nephrons.31 Such distinct localization of renal
injuries and mode of progression may be related to the anatomical and
functional heterogeneities of different nephron populations.
Figure 1 illustrates the anatomical relationships of the renal vascu￾lature and tubular segments. The juxtamedullary glomeruli are located
deep in the cortex and their afferent arterioles arise from either the
initial segment of the interlobular artery or directly from the arcuate
artery. In more superficial nephrons, their glomerular afferent arter￾ioles branch off from the more distal segments of the interlobular
arteries. Since glomerular capillary pressure is normally maintained at

about 50 mm Hg by autoregulation in all nephrons,35 the pressure
gradient across the afferent arteriole would be greatest in the juxta￾medullary nephron. In other words, the juxtamedullary afferent
arteriole is exposed to an unusually high pressure as a vessel of its
size (about 20 mm), and therefore has to maintain a strong vascular
tone in order to provide this large pressure gradient in a short distance
between the large arcuate artery, where the pressure is normally about
90 mmHg, and the glomerulus. In contrast, in the superficial
nephrons, a more gradual pressure reduction occurs along the greater
length of the vasculature, including the entire interlobular artery and
afferent arterioles. It is of note that the interlobular artery also
participates in renal autoregulation,36,37 and therefore the feeding
pressure of the superficial afferent arteriole is substantially lower than
that of the juxtamedullary afferent arteriole.36 Thus, the pressure
load per unit length of the afferent arteriole is much larger in the
juxtamedullary nephrons compared with the more superficial
nephrons, owing to which elevations of renal perfusion pressure
would impact first and more severely within the walls of the juxta￾medullary afferent arteriole. When the afferent arterioles are damaged
by hypertension, they lose their autoregulatory ability,38 resulting in
glomerular hypertension and subsequently glomerular sclerosis.
In addition to anatomical heterogeneities, some differences in the
mechanism of autoregulation in the superficial and juxtamedullary
afferent arterioles may contribute to the unique localization of renal
injuries seen in various hypertensive models. The two major mechan￾isms of autoregulation are the myogenic response and tubuloglomerular
feedback (TGF).39–43 The myogenic response is a very fast response,
whereas TGF is a rather slower response that requires a time lag between
a change in afferent arteriolar pressure and a change in tubular fluid
composition at the macula densa.44,45 The contribution of TGF to
autoregulation has been shown to be much greater in the juxtamedul￾lary nephron than in the superficial nephron.35 Thus, when BP changes
suddenly, transient changes in glomerular capillary pressure would be
greater in the juxtamedullary nephron than in the superficial nephron.
Interestingly, it is reported that in SHRs, such transient changes in
glomerular capillary pressure of the juxtamedullary nephron are much
greater than in normotensive Wistar–Kyoto rats.46 In addition, micro￾puncture studies have shown that only juxtamedullary (but not super￾ficial) glomerular capillary pressure is elevated in SHR as compared
with WKY, and this elevation becomes prominent in old SHRs.31
Finally, it is reported that uninephrectomy causes selective deep
nephron hyperfiltration in SHRs but not in WKY.47 These alterations
in zonal hemodynamics within the kidney may be able to explain the
observation that glomerular sclerosis is seen primarily in the juxtame￾dullary nephrons in SHR, despite the fact that whole kidney auto￾regulation is well preserved and the degree of total renal damage is
much less than that seen in other hypertensive models, such as in Ang
II-induced hypertension and Dahl salt-sensitive hypertensive rats.48–53
The study of Mori et al.
34 in Ang II-induced hypertension gives a
strong support to the concept that hypertension itself causes tissue
injuries primarily in the juxtamedullary cortex and outer medulla.
Using the servo-control method, they kept perfusion pressure to the

pressure-uncontrolled right kidney. However, despite the exposure to
high Ang II, tissue damages were largely prevented in the pressure￾controlled left kidney. Figure 2b summarizes the degree of glomerular
injuries in this study. In contrast to the great attenuation of injuries in
the juxtamedullary glomeruli in the pressure-controlled kidney, the
superficial glomeruli were damaged to a similar extent in both the
right and left kidneys. The elevated renal perfusion pressure therefore
caused tissue injuries primarily in the juxtamedullary glomeruli and
tubulointerstitium of the outer medulla, whereas the Ang II alone
resulted in injuries to the superficial nephrons independent of the
levels of perfusion pressure (Figure 2c). As hypertension would affect
the juxtamedullary nephrons much more strongly than the superficial
nephrons as discussed earlier, one would predict that prevention of
renal pressure elevation in the Ang II model of hypertension would
have greatly reduced injuries of the juxtamedullary nephrons. In
addition, there are heterogeneities in the vasoconstrictor actions of
Ang II in the superficial and juxtamedullary afferent arterioles. By
microperfusing the afferent arteriole, in vitro, we have previously
shown that vasoconstriction induced by intraluminal Ang II is
much stronger in the superficial than in the juxtamedullary afferent
arterioles, with maximal constriction being 70% and 30%, respec￾tively.54 Thus, when a high concentration of Ang II is present in renal
circulation, it would constrict the superficial afferent arteriole very
strongly, and consequently ischemic damages would be induced
irrespective of whether BP is elevated or not.
For the tubulointerstitial injuries of the outer medulla seen in
various hypertensive models,32–34 several factors would seem to be
involved. Blood flow to the renal medulla is supplied by the descend￾ing vasa recta, which emanate from the efferent arterioles of the
juxtamedullary glomeruli (Figure 1).55 In the outer medulla, particu￾larly in the inner stripe, descending vasa recta (containing arterial
blood) and ascending vasa recta (containing venous blood) run side￾by-side in opposite directions, forming a counter-current circula￾tion.56 Oxygen thereby diffuses from the descending to the ascending
vasa recta, reducing the oxygen content as blood descends through the
vasa recta vessels.56 In addition, oxygen consumption is very high in
the outer medulla because of the high levels of active ion transport in
the thick ascending limbs of the loops of Henle (TALs) and proximal
straight tubules, thereby reducing the oxygen content even further in
this region.56–61 In contrast, oxygen consumption is very small in the
inner medulla because there is no active transport by the thin loop of
Henle and therefore tissue oxygen tension is well preserved.56 Thus, the
outer medulla is the anatomical site most susceptible to injuries such as
ischemia.62 When the juxtamedullary glomeruli are injured by hyper￾tension, the impairment of oxygen delivery downstream from the vasa
recta vessels would be expected to result in tubulointerstitial injuries in
the outer medulla. Superimposed on these factors, a number of other
elements, including neurohormonal factors,56 inflammatory path￾ways,53 oxidative stress63,64 and tubular transport,65,66 are involved in
the pathogenesis of the injuries, among which tubulovascular crosstalk
is of particular interest.63,64,67,68 We have recently shown that an
increase in tubular transport at the mTAL enhances superoxide
production and reduces nitric oxide synthesis.63–65,67 These changes
would be transmitted to the neighboring vasa recta and would there￾fore facilitate vasoconstriction and reduction of medullary blood flow.
ALBUMINURIA AS AN EARLY MARKER OF STRAIN VESSEL
INJURIES
Many diseases and mechanisms have been proposed to cause micro￾albuminuria.30 However, as discussed above, regardless of the patho￾genesis of microalbuminuria, the anatomical sites that are injured
initially or more severely are the juxtamedullary afferent arterioles and
glomeruli.32–34 It would be reasonable to expect that in the early stages
of hypertension, diabetes or aging, renal injury occurs predominantly
in the juxtamedullary nephrons, whereas the majority of other
nephrons remain relatively intact. This would be expected to result
in only minimal increases of urinary albumin excretion.
From the hemodynamic point of view, the juxtamedullary afferent
arterioles are small and short vessels that are exposed to a high
pressure and therefore have to maintain a strong vascular tone in
order to provide a large pressure gradient in a short distance.69 We will
refer to these kinds of vessels as ‘strain vessels’. Thus, microalbumi￾nuria may be an early marker of vascular damages of strain vessels
within the body. Other strain vessels exist most notably in the central
nervous system, where many perforating arteries arise directly from
large high-pressure arteries, such as anterior, middle or posterior
cerebral arteries, and penetrate into the brain tissues (Figure 3).70 As
in the case of juxtamedullary afferent arterioles, these perforating
arteries are exposed to a high pressure and therefore have to maintain
large pressure gradients from their parent arteries to brain tissue
capillaries.71,72 It is well known that the sites of hemorrhage or
infarction in the brain are frequently the areas of blood supply
governed by these perforating arteries.70,73 Thus, ‘strain vessel injuries’
may explain the link between vascular damage and microalbuminuria
in the kidney and cerebral stroke. Indeed we recently observed that in
stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR-SPs) fed a high￾salt diet, appearance of significant albuminuria was closely associated
with vascular injuries in both the juxtamedullary nephrons and the
perforating arteries of middle cerebral arteries, whereas superficial
nephrons remained relatively intact (unpublished observations).
According to our hypothesis, the relatively weak relationships
observed between albuminuria and endothelial dysfunction can be
attributed to the endothelial dysfunction of strain vessels preceeding
that of the general circulation under various conditions, such as
hypertension, diabetes and aging. In addition, the importance of
arterial stiffness for the association between cerebro-CVDs and albu￾minuria may be deduced74 from the fact that strain vessels are directly
influenced by the hemodynamics of large arteries. Unlike other small
vessels in peripheral circulation in which blood flow and pressure are
rather constant, the strain vessels are exposed to pulsatile pressure and
flow, and therefore the stiffness of large arteries would greatly
influence the burden imposed on strain vessels.75,76
There may be similar, albeit not the same, hemodynamic conditions
existing in the coronary circulations.77 It is well known that coronary
blood flow depends primarily on diastolic and not on systolic BP:78,79
namely, coronary arteries arise directly from the aorta, and during the
systolic phase there is little coronary blood flow because intramyo￾cardial vessels are compressed due to myocardial contraction. This
creates a unique situation that during the systolic phase the entire
epicardial segments of coronary arteries, including small arteries just
before their entering the myocardium, are exposed to a very high
pressure, because there is little outflow. Studies have shown that
coronary arteries (particularly small-sized segments) exhibit myogenic
responses,80,81 so that when intraluminal pressure is elevated, they
would contract strongly in order to maintain vascular integrity.
Therefore, although coronary arteries do not provide a pressure
gradient, they would still be under high-pressure hemodynamic
conditions with a strong vascular tone, which would be similar,
though not the same, to those of strain vessels in the kidney and
central nervous system.
Our strain vessel hypothesis would also explain the close linkage
between hypertensive retinopathy and cerebro-CVDs as reviewed by
Strain vessel hypothesis

Wong et al.
82 The retinal artery is derived from the ophthalmic artery,
which is the first branch emanating from the high-pressure internal
carotid artery. The pressure in the central retinal artery, which can be
measured by an ophthalmodynamometer, is about half of the systemic
BP.83 Therefore, retinal circulation has hemodynamic characteristics
similar to those of perforating arteries. Hypertensive retinopathy is
a microvascular injury associated with increased BP and has long
been an indicator of atherosclerosis.84,85 The risk of incident stroke
increases by 2–3-folds in patients with retinopathy. Hypertensive
retinopathy is also associated with microalbuminuria, renal dysfunc￾tion and left ventricular hypertrophy.86,87 Approximately two-thirds
of patients with central retinal artery occlusion have high BP and
one-fourth are associated with cardiovascular diseases.
ALBUMINURIA AND SALT SENSITIVITY OF BP
One of the features of microalbuminuria is its close association with the
salt sensitivity of BP,9,88 and this association is observed even in normo￾tensive subjects.9 Salt-sensitive hypertension is characterized by glomerular
hypertension, microalbuminuria,89 and a higher mortality and morbidity
of cardiovascular events.89,90 Interestingly, the association between micro￾albuminuria and salt sensitivity of BP has been shown not only in diabetic
or hypertensive populations but also in apparently healthy subjects.9
There are many mechanisms involved in the salt sensitivity of BP.
When salt is ingested with meals, various neuro-hormonal changes,
such as inhibition of the renin–angiotensin system and enhanced
production of prostaglandin, would occur and thereby increase GFR
and reduce tubular sodium reabsorption. These changes would
promote sodium excretion; however, in order to accomplish complete
sodium balance, these alone would not be sufficient, and would
therefore require the mechanism of pressure natriuresis (Figure 4).91
According to our hypothesis, microalbuminuria indicates the existence
of damages in juxtamedullary afferent arterioles and glomeruli, and
therefore impairments in the downstream medullary circulation. As
the medullary circulation plays a crucial role in the mechanisms of
pressure natriuresis,92,93 microalbuminuria may be related to impaired
pressure natriuresis, and therefore the salt sensitivity of BP. Thus, our
strain vessel hypothesis may explain the close interrelationships among
microalbuminuria, the salt sensitivity of BP, and cerebro-cardiovas￾cular mortality and morbidity. It should be noted, however, that other
factors, such as the rennin–angiotensin system and insulin sensitivity,
also play a role in the salt sensitivity of BP.

crucial role in the mechanism of pressure natriuresis. Medullary blood flow
is supplied via the vasa recta, downstream from the juxtamedullary
glomerulus. In the phase of albuminuria, juxtamedullary glomeruli are
injured, and therefore downstream circulation through the vasa recta is
impaired. This in turn causes blunted pressure natriuresis and consequently
an enhanced salt-sensitivity of BP. RAS, renin–angiotensin system; NP,

AN EVOLUTIONARY POINT OF VIEW
Why do we have such vulnerable structures as strain vessels? From the
evolutionary point of view, we speculate that perforating arteries,
juxtamedullary nephrons, retinal arteries and coronary circulation
have important structure–function relationships. All creatures, in their
natural environments, were constantly facing the danger of circulatory
collapse. Given the generally difficult access to salt and a high risk of
wound injuries, hypotension and hypoperfusion of vital organs were
the principal challenges with which they had to cope. Therefore, in
order to maintain the perfusion of the vital tissues such as the
brainstem, it was necessary to develop circulatory systems in which
vessels are branched off directly from the large arteries and deliver
blood to the tissue. Without sufficient evolutionary time to adapt to
the modern diets of the rapidly developed industrialized societies, the
organisms were not designed to cope with high salt intake, hyperten￾sion and obesity, as reviewed elsewhere.94–97 Taken together, the close
link between microalbuminuria, salt sensitivity and CVDs may be
viewed as inevitable consequences of evolution. In other words, while
we, human beings, enjoy the benefits of the many developments
brought in by the industrial evolution, we have to keep in mind
that our fate is still governed by the natural law of evolution.
PERSPECTIVES
There may be several mechanisms underlying the link between the
albuminuria and CVDs. It is now clear that hypertension, diabetes and
renal dysfunction are associated with endothelial dysfunction.
Although albuminuria may be associated with endothelial dysfunction
in the systemic circulation, it may better reflect the burden imposed
on strain vessels such as juxtamedullary afferent arterioles in the
kidney, perforating arteries in the central nervous system, retinal
arteries and coronary arteries. The strain vessel hypothesis may explain
why hypertension and diabetes, unforeseen in the concept of evolu￾tion, preferentially affect vital organs such as the brain, heart and
kidney.
