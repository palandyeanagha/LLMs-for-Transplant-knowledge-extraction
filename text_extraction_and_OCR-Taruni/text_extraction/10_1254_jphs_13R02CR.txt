Critical Review
1. Introduction
The superfamily of seven transmembrane (TM) span￾ning, G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) is one of 
the largest and most diverse group of proteins involved 
in signal transduction in mammals (1). Endothelin recep￾tors (ETRs) consist of two subtypes: ETAR and ETBR, 
both of which belong to the GPCR superfamily (2). 
ETAR and ETBR are pharmacologically characterized 
by their affinities for the endothelin peptide family that 
comprises three vasoactive ligands (ET-1, ET-2, and 
ET-3): ETAR has high affinities for ET-1 and ET-2 and 
100-fold lower affinity for ET-3, while ETBR demon￾strates equal affinities for all ligands (3, 4). Activation of 
ETAR and ETBR mediates many important functions, 
including vasoconstriction, cardiovascular remodeling, 
cell proliferation, cell differentiation, extracellular matrix 
production, and control of water and sodium secretion 
(4 – 6). Although the pathophysiological role of ETAR 
and ETBR has not yet been completely elucidated, ETAR 
is considered as a bad receptor involved in pathogenesis 
and development of various diseases such as systemic 
and pulmonary hypertension, atherosclerosis, diabetes, 
and cardiac remodeling after myocardial ischemia (4, 6, 
7). On the other hand, ETBR has been classified as a good 
receptor since it functions as a “clearance receptor” to 
prevent ET-1 from excessively stimulating ETAR and 
enhances endothelial production of nitric oxide (NO) and 
prostacyclin (PGI2) to cause vasodilatation (7).
It is traditionally accepted that GPCRs transduce the 
binding of their agonists into activation of heterotrimeric 
G proteins composed of Ga and Gbg subunits to stimu￾late or inhibit second messenger formation and/or ion 
channel activity. Ligand-activated, Gq protein–coupled 
ETRs induce production of the second messengers such 
as inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol 
(DAG) via Gq protein–linked phospholipase Cb (PLCb)

Abstract. The endothelin (ET) system consists of two G protein coupled–receptors (GPCRs), 
ET type A receptor (ETAR) and ET type B receptor (ETBR), and three endogenous ligands, ET-1, 
ET-2, and ET-3. Stimulation of ETRs with ET-1 induces an increase in intracellular Ca2+ concen￾tration that is involved in a diverse array of physiological and pathophysiological processes, 
including vasoconstriction, and cell proliferation. Store-operated Ca2+ entry and receptor-operated 
Ca2+ entry triggered by activation of ETRs are regulated or modulated by endoplasmic reticulum 
Ca2+ sensor (stromal interaction molecule 1) and voltage-independent cation channels (transient 
receptor potential canonical channels and Orai1). The ET-1–induced Ca2+ mobilization results 
from activation of heterotrimeric G proteins by ETRs. In contrast, GPCR biology including 
modulation of receptor function and trafficking is regulated by a variety of GPCR interacting 
proteins (GIPs) that generally interact with the C-terminal domain of GPCRs. The ETR signaling 
is also regulated by GIPs such as Jun activation domain-binding protein 1. This review focuses on 
the regulatory mechanisms of the ETR signaling with special attention to the components involved 
in Ca2+ signaling and to GIPs in the signal transduction, modification, and degradation of ETRs.

and activation of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels 
(VDCCs) and voltage-independent cation channels 
(8 – 11). In addition, ETR-mediated Ca2+ mobilization 
is physiologically controlled by a complicated process 
involving transient receptor potential canonical (TRPC) 
channels, Na+
/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX), and so on (8 – 10, 
12 – 14).
Accumulating evidence suggests that the GPCR 
biology including receptor targeting, trafficking, signal￾ing, and desensitization is regulated by a variety of 
GPCR-interacting proteins (GIPs) in addition to G
proteins (15 – 17). GIPs involved in G protein–dependent 
and –independent signaling contain protein–protein 
interaction domains that play an important role in the 
formation of large functional complexes called ‘recepto￾somes’ (15 – 18). The discovery of GIPs has provided 
insights into the GPCR pharmacology. The ETR signal￾ing is reported to be regulated by Jun activation domain￾binding protein 1 (Jab1) identified as a binding partner 
of the ETR C-terminal tail (19).
This review will briefly address the ET system consist￾ing of two receptor subtypes (ETAR and ETBR) and 
three endogenous ligands (ET-1, ET-2, and ET-3). Then, 
we will highlight current insights into the regulatory 
mechanisms of the ETR signaling, with main focus on 
the components involved in ETR-activated Ca2+ mobili￾zation and on the GIPs in the signal transduction, 
modification, and degradation of ETRs.
2. ET system
2.1. ET synthesis
In 1985, Hickey et al. (20) have demonstrated that 
the aortic endothelial cells (ECs) generate a polypeptide 
substance that induces tonic contraction of vascular 
smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) in an extracellular Ca2+-
dependent manner. In 1988, Yanagisawa et al. (3) have 
succeeded in isolating the 21 amino acid vasoconstrictor 
peptide from cultured ECs and they have named this 
EC-derived polypeptide vasoconstrictor “ET”. The ET 
peptide family consists of three peptides, ET-1, ET-2, 
and ET-3, which contain 21 amino acids (21) (Fig. 1A). 
ET-1 is the predominant isoform in the cardiovascular 
system and possesses numerous pharmacological pro￾perties such as vasopressor action, positive inotropic 
and chronotropic effects, and facilitatory action on 
cardiovascular remodeling (22).
ET-1 is generated in a variety of cells, including ECs, 
VSMCs, cardiomyocytes, macrophages, leukocytes, 
and fibroblasts, but the main site of ET-1 production is 
EC (22). The ET-1 production and secretion are con￾trolled at the gene transcription level (23). ET-1 synthesis 
is initiated by prepro ET-1 transcription, which is posi￾tively or negatively regulated by several types of 
chemical factors (22, 24) (Fig. 1B). ET-1 is produced 
primarily as an inactive 212 amino acid precursor, prepro 
ET-1, which undergoes sequential proteolytic cleavages 
(Fig. 1B). Prepro ET-1 is processed to pro ET-1 which is 
subsequently proteolyzed by furin-like protease to form 
biologically inactive 39 amino acid called big ET-1. 
Big ET-1 is cleaved by ET-converting enzyme (ECE), 
a family of metalloproteases, to produce the mature 
ET-1, which is a bioactive 21 amino acid peptide. The 
conversion of big ET-1 to ET-1 is physiologically impor￾tant, because the vasoconstrictor potency of ET-1 is 
140-fold higher than that of big ET-1 (25).

2.2. The physiological and pathophysiological role of 
the ET system in the vascular system
The physiological and pathophysiological actions of 
ET-1 are mediated through two receptor subtypes, ETAR 
and ETBR. Many lines of evidence indicate that ET-1 is 
of pathophysiological importance in the development 
of several cardiovascular diseases including pulmonary 
arterial hypertension (PAH) (26, 27), salt-sensitive 
hypertension (28, 29), essential hypertension (30), 
atherosclerosis (31), cardiac remodeling after heart 
failure (32), and vascular complications associated with 
diabetes mellitus (31). At present, ETR antagonists 
such as bosentan are used clinically in the treatment of 
PAH (26, 27).
ETAR is highly expressed in VSMCs but not in ECs 
(33), and this receptor contributes to the ET-1–induced 
contraction and proliferation of VSMCs involved in 
PAH (26, 27) and salt-sensitive hypertension (28, 29). 
On the other hand, ETBR is mostly expressed in ECs 
(34), where ETBR activation with ET-1 accelerates the 
production of vasodilators such as NO and PGI2 and 
clearance of ET-1 from circulation (35 – 38). The endo￾thelial NO generation mediated via ETBR inhibits prolif￾eration of VSMCs (39). ETBR is also expressed in some 
VSMCs, and ETBR-mediated vasoconstriction may be 
involved in essential hypertension (30).
In VSMCs, stimulation of ETAR coupled to Gq/11 and 
G12/13 proteins with ET-1 induces phosphorylation of 
myosin light chain (MLC) that triggers vasoconstriction 
mediated through Ca2+-dependent MLC kinase (MLCK) 
and the Ca2+-independent Rho kinase (ROCK) pathway 
(28, 29) (Fig. 2). Activation of Gq/11 protein stimulates 
PLCb that induces IP3 production and the subsequent 
increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) due 
to Ca2+ release from the IP3-sensitive intracellular Ca2+
store and Ca2+ influx via store-operated Ca2+ channels 
(SOCC) and/or receptor-operated Ca2+ channels (ROCC), 
resulting in Ca2+ and calmodulin (CaM)-dependent 
activation of MLCK (40). G12/13 protein has been impli￾cated in ROCK-mediated Ca2+ sensitization that begins 
after activation of Rho guanine nucleotide exchange fac￾tors (Rho-GEFs) (40). Activation of the ROCK pathway 
stimulates phosphorylation of myosin phosphatase (MP), 
leading to potentiation of vasoconstriction by suppress￾ing MP-mediated dephosphorylation of MLC (40). In 
addition, Ca2+-dependent and -independent phosphoryla￾tion of CPI-17 [protein kinase C (PKC)-potentiated 
inhibitor protein of 17 kDa], an inhibitor of MP, reduces 
activity of MP, resulting in Ca2+ sensitization of contrac￾tion in VSMCs (41 – 43).
In ECs, stimulation of ETBR with ET-1 exerts two 
main actions: i) release of vasodilators, NO and PGI2, 
and ii) clearance of ET-1 from the circulation within 
the lungs and kidney (44). ET-1, which is released from 
ECs, binds to ETBR expressed in ECs to elevate [Ca2+]i
via the Gq protein–linked PLCb pathway. The increase 
in [Ca2+]i induces Ca2+/CaM-dependent activation of 
endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and Ca2+-
dependent induction of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) 
expression, leading to production of NO and PGI2, 
respectively (Fig. 3). In addition, Gbg subunit released 
from endothelial ETBR stimulates the phosphoinositide 
3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/eNOS pathway, resulting in the 
production of NO (45). NO and PGI2 act on the VSMCs 
and activate the guanylate cyclase/cGMP/protein kinase 
G (PKG) pathway and adenylate cyclase (AC)/cAMP/
protein kinase A (PKA) pathway, respectively, thus 
triggering vasorelaxation by decreasing [Ca2+]i (44). 
ET-1–bound ETBR is rapidly internalized following 
agonist stimulation, and sorted to the early endo￾Fig. 2. Role of ETAR-mediated signaling in

ETAR with ET-1 can increase vascular smooth

3. Molecular mechanisms of ETR-mediated Ca2+
signaling
3.1. Fundamental mechanisms for store-operated and 
receptor-operated Ca2+ entry
An increase in [Ca2+]i is an important signaling in 
virtually every cell for controlling diverse physiological 
and pathophysiological processes, including exocytosis, 
vasoconstriction, angiogenesis, cell proliferation, tran￾scription, and apoptosis (46, 47). The Ca2+ signaling is 
generated by stimuli acting through a variety of cell 
surface receptors, including GPCRs and receptor tyrosine 
kinases (RTKs) (48). In most nonexcitable cells, recep￾tor-mediated intracellular Ca2+ mobilization consists of 
two interdependent and closely coupled components: 
rapid, transient release of Ca2+ stored in the endoplasmic 
reticulum (ER), followed by slowly developing extra￾cellular Ca2+ entry. It is well-known that stimulation of 
GPCR and RTK activates a family of PLC enzymes 
(PLCb and PLCg) that increases the production of the 
second messengers, IP3 and DAG, by hydrolysis of 
phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) (Fig. 4). 
Binding of IP3 to its receptor on ER triggers release of 
Ca2+ from ER, resulting in the generation of initial Ca2+
signal phase (49, 50). It is widely accepted that the 
depletion of Ca2+ within the ER produces sustained Ca2+

signal phase, resulting from store-operated Ca2+ entry 
(SOCE) through several types of voltage-independent 
Ca2+-permeable cation channels such as SOCCs (50). In 
cardiomyocytes and VSMCs, the sustained Ca2+ signal￾ing is also generated by DAG which induces PKC￾dependent or -independent activation of ROCCs to 
trigger receptor-operated Ca2+ entry (ROCE) (51, 52). 
Unlike VDCCs, the molecular entity of SOCCs and 
ROCCs was controversial for a long time.
3.2. TRPC channels
Increasing evidence now suggests that TRPC channels 
are responsible for SOCE and ROCE (9, 10, 14, 53). 
The TRPC family consisting of TRPC1-7 is divided 
phylogenetically into four distinct subfamilies (TRPC1; 
TRPC2; TRPC3, 6 and 7; TRPC4 and 5) (54). Like other 
six TM pore-forming ion channels such as voltage-gated 
K+
 channels, all TRPC channels are either homo- or 
heteromultimers of four TRPC subunits, each containing 
six TM domains, cytoplasmic N and C termini, and a 
putative cation-permeable pore region between TM5 and 
TM6 (55). The pore of TRPC channels is permeable to 
several types of cation including Ca2+ and Na+
, but their 
cation permeability differs depending on TRPC isoforms 
(53). Since activation of GPCRs simultaneously medi￾ates SOCE and ROCE (9, 10, 14), it is difficult to 
determine which TRPC isoforms function as SOCCs or 
ROCCs. However, TRPC3 and its close relatives, TRPC6 
and TRPC7, are predicted to function as GPCR-activated 
ROCCs rather than SOCCs because exogenous applica￾tion of DAG can activate TRPC3, TRPC6, and TRPC7 
without causing store depletion (56, 57). On the other 
hand, TRPC1, TRPC4, and TRPC5 are considered as 
SOCCs, since these channels are activated by store 
depletion but not DAG. Functional roles of native TRPC 
channels activated by stimulation of typical GPCRs are 
summarized in Table 1.
TRPC channels are permeable to Na+
 in addition to 
Ca2+. Evidence has been accumulating that in cardiomyo￾cytes and VSMCs, Na+
 influx via TRPC3 and TRPC6 
triggers Ca2+ influx via NCX and L-type VDCC (Fig. 5), 
both of which play an important physiological role in

maintaining Ca2+ homeostasis in many mammalian 
tissues. NCX triggers the electrogenic exchange of one 
Ca2+ for three Na+
 either into or out of the cells, depend￾ing on the prevailing electrochemical driving force 
across the plasma membrane (58). Therefore, Na+
 entry 
via Na+
-permeable TRPC3 and TRPC6 results in activa￾tion of NCX operating in the reverse mode to transport 
Ca2+ into cells (59 – 61). In addition, excessive increase 
in intracellular Na+
 concentration mediated through 
TRPC3 and TRPC6 induces the depolarization of cell 
membrane, leading to activation of L-type VDCCs to 
trigger Ca2+ influx (62, 63). Thus, functional coupling of 
Na+
 entry via TRPC3 and TRPC6 with Ca2+ entry via 
NCX and L-type VDCC is an important machinery 
underlying GPCR-mediated Ca2+ mobilization in cardio￾myocytes and VSMCs (Fig. 5).
3.3. STIM1 and Orai1
The recent discovery of stromal interaction molecule 
1 (STIM1) and Orai1 as new components linking ER 
Ca2+ depletion to SOCC activation has brought new 
insights into the understanding of SOCE (14, 64, 65). 
STIM1, a single TM–spanning protein, was identified 
as an ER Ca2+ sensor essential for SOCE triggered by 
Ca2+-store depletion (14, 64). Orai1, a four TM–spanning 
protein, was recognized as being an essential component 
for SOCC (66). In resting Ca2+ store–filled cells, STIM1 
is uniformly distributed on the ER. When a decrease 
in the ER Ca2+ level is sensed by the STIM1 luminal EF￾hand Ca2+-binding domain, STIM1 forms clusters close 
to the plasma membrane (64, 67). In most nonexcitable 
cells, the store-operated aggregation of STIM1 is a 
critical process to facilitate its interaction with Orai1 
channels located in the plasma membrane, thereby acti￾vating SOCE (64, 67).
An electrophysiological and molecular biological 
approach provides valuable insights into the functional 
significance of STIM1 to regulate TRPC channels (65). 
In human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells exo￾genously coexpressing TRPC channels and STIM1, 
STIM1 binds directly to TRPC1, TRPC4, and TRPC5 
and determines their function as SOCCs (65), whereas 
it does not bind directly to TRPC3 and TRPC6 (65). 
In contrast to the previous report, our recent study sug￾gests that, in HEK293 cells exogenously coexpressing 
ETAR, TRPC channels and STIM1 or STIM1L, STIM1, 
and its novel splice variant STIM1L bind directly to both 
TRPC3 and TRPC6 and thereby regulates negatively 
ETAR-operated Ca2+ entry via TRPC3 and TRPC6 (14) 
(see section 3.7).
3.4. Regulation of ETR-mediated Ca2+ signaling by 
TRPC, STIM1, and Orai1
Activation of ETR-mediated Ca2+ signaling is an im￾portant stimulus for excessive proliferation of VSMCs 
such as pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) 
and is involved in the development of several cardio￾vascular diseases including PAH. In PASMCs, stimula￾tion of ETRs with ET-1 mediates upregulation of TRPC6 
expression, leading to enhancement of ET-1–induced 
increase in [Ca2+]i and facilitation of cell proliferation 
(68). Indeed, the protein expression level of TRPC6 in 
PASMCs from patients with idiopathic PAH (IPAH) is 
much higher than in PASMCs from normal subjects (69). 
Interestingly, extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 
(ERK1/2)-mediated phosphorylation and subsequent 
activation of STIM1 (70), a key regulator of SOCE, 
enhance ET-1–induced SOCE via Orai1 in VSMCs, 
perhaps contributing to acceleration and prolongation 
of ET-1–increased blood pressure (71). Thus, ETR￾mediated Ca2+ signaling in VSMCs can be potentiated 
by three distinct mechanisms: i) ET-1–induced upregula￾tion of TRPC6, ii) activation of STIM1 by ET-1–induced 
Ca2+ store depletion resulting from IP3 receptor–mediated 
release of Ca2+ from ER, and iii) phosphorylation and 
subsequent activation of STIM1 by ET-1–induced stimu￾lation of ERK1/2.
3.5. TRPC isoforms functioning as ETAR-operated 
Ca2+ channels
Stimulation of endogenous ETAR expressed in VSMCs 
and of exogenous ETAR expressed in Chinese hamster 
ovary cells triggers ROCE via nonselective cation 
channels (NSCCs) that are activated independently of 
store depletion (8, 72, 73). As mentioned above, TRPC 
channels have been identified as potential candidates for 
ROCCs (receptor-activated NSCCs). However, it was 
unclear which TRPC isoforms form ETAR-operated Ca2+
channels that can function independently of store 
depletion.
Recently, our functional studies with [Ca2+]i measure￾ment have provided direct evidence that stimulation of 
ETAR elicits ROCE via TRPC3, TRPC5, TRPC6, and 
Fig. 5. Functional coupling of Na+
 entry via TRPC3 and TRPC6 
with Ca2+ entry via Na+
/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX) and L-type voltage￾dependent Ca2+ channels.

Endothelin Receptor Signaling 91
TRPC7 in HEK293 cells exogenously coexpressing 
ETAR and one of the green fluorescent protein (GFP)-
tagged TRPC channels (9). Since ETAR stimulation 
activates SOCE in addition to ROCE, we have employed 
an ER Ca2+-depletion/Ca2+-restoration protocol that 
makes it possible to distinguish between SOCE and 
ROCE (74). In this protocol, the presence of 10 mM Gd3+
in the extracellular medium allows us to more clearly 
estimate ROCE by inhibiting the endogenous capacita￾tive Ca2+ entry (SOCE) that masks the ROCE via TRPC3 
and TRPC7 exogenously expressed in HEK293 cells 
(75). As shown in Fig. 6, in nominally Ca2+-free solution, 
2 mM thapsigargin (TG), an intracellular Ca2+ pump in￾hibitor, acutely elicits Ca2+ release from the ER, causing 
a transient increase in [Ca2+]i that immediately returns to 
near baseline. Subsequent restoration of extracellular 
Ca2+ to 2 mM triggers Gd3+-insensitive SOCE consisting 
of transient and sustained Ca2+ influx. In HEK293 cells 
expressing GFP as a control, addition of 10 nM ET-1 
after the SOCE does not induce a further increase in 
[Ca2+]i (Fig. 6A). Thus, ETAR stimulation fails to activate 
ROCE in HEK293 cells not transfected with TRPC 
channel (76).
On the other hand, Gd3+-insensitive ROCE in response 
to stimulation of ETAR with 10 nM ET-1 is observed 
in the TG-treated HEK293 cells expressing TRPC3 
(Fig. 6C), TRPC5 (Fig. 6E), TRPC6 (Fig. 6F), and 
TRPC7 (Fig. 6G), whereas the ROCE is not observed 
in the cells expressing TRPC1 (Fig. 6B) and TRPC4 
(Fig. 6D). The TRPC3- and TRPC5-mediated ROCE 
consists of a transient peak and a subsequent sustained 
increase, while only transient influx is observed for 
TRPC6 and TRPC7. These results suggest that TRPC3, 
TRPC5, TRPC6, and TRPC7 function as ETAR-operated 
Ca2+ channels. Among the ETAR-operated TRPC chan￾nels, this review focuses on the regulatory mechanisms 
of TRPC3 and TRPC6 channels.
3.6. Regulation of ETAR-operated TRPC6 by AC/
cAMP/PKA signaling pathway
There is accumulating evidence that augmentation 
of Ca2+ influx through up-regulated TRPC6 channels is 
involved in the development of cardiovascular diseases 
such as IPAH associated with the continued stimulation

cAMP/PKA signaling pathway with Gs protein–coupled 
PGI2 receptor (IP) agonists is highly effective against 
IPAH (26). Although TRPC6 is reported to be phos￾phorylated by PKA, the functional role of PKA-mediated 
phosphorylation in the regulation of TRPC6 channel 
activity remains controversial. That is, Nishioka et al. 
(77) have reported that the PKA-dependent phosphoryla￾tion of TRPC6 inhibits the channel activity in VSMCs, 
whereas Hassock et al. (78) have reported that the 
phosphorylation does not affect the channel function in 
platelets.
Our recent study has clearly shown that the AC/cAMP/
PKA signaling pathway negatively regulates TRPC6-
mediated ROCE in response to ETAR stimulation (10). 
In HEK293 cells coexpressing ETAR and TRPC6, ETAR￾operated Ca2+ entry is inhibited by either forskolin 
(Fig. 7A), an AC activator, or papaverine, a non-selective 
phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitor, both of which in￾crease the intracellular cAMP level, thereby activating 
PKA (10). In addition, ETAR-mediated ROCE via 
TRPC6 is enhanced by Rp-8-Br-cAMP (8-bromoadenosine￾3′,5′-cyclic monophosphorothioate, Rp-isomer), a mem￾brane-permeable PKA inhibitor, but inhibited by 8-
Br-cAMP, a membrane-permeable direct PKA activator 
(10). These data show that the activity of TRPC6 is 
negatively regulated via phosphorylation by PKA.
Several studies to determine the primary sequence 
specificities of protein kinases have demonstrated that 
PKA is an arginine-directed serine/threonine protein 
kinase that prefers arginine residue at positions −4 to −1 
amino-terminal to the phosphorylation site (79 – 81). 
The highest selectivity is recognized at arginine residues 
at the −3 and −2 positions (R-R-X-S/T) and the lysine 
residue at the −2 position is the second preferred amino 
acid (R-L-X-S/T) (79). There are potential sequences 
for PKA-mediated phosphorylation within the intra￾cellular N-terminal region of TRPC6, that is, R-R-G-G-S 
at serine 14 (Ser14), R-R-N-E-S at Ser28, R-R-Q-T at

subunit. These phosphorylation levels were normalized by the quantity of total TRPC6 protein (total TRPC6). Data are presented

threonine 69 (Thr69), and R-K-L-S at Ser321. Except Thr69
involved in the PKA-mediated negative regulation of 
TRPC6 activity (77), it is not clear whether other 
potential phosphorylation sites are actually involved in 
the regulation of TRPC6 activity by PKA.
Functional study with TRPC6 mutants carrying an 
alanine substitution for these serine/threonine residues 
has shown that the inhibitory effects of forskolin and 
papaverine on the ET-1–induced, TRPC6-mediated 
ROCE are diminished by replacement of Ser28 (S28A) 
(Fig. 7B for forskolin) but not by replacement of other 
residues (Ser14, Thr69, and Ser321) with alanine (S14A, 
T69A, and S321A) (10). This finding indicates that 
TRPC6 is negatively regulated by PKA-mediated phos￾phorylation of Ser28. Several lines of evidence indicate 
that TRPC6 is a substrate for various protein kinases 
such as Ca2+/CaM-dependent protein kinase II (82), Src 
tyrosine kinase (83), PKC (84, 85), and PKG (86, 87), 
in addition to PKA (10, 77). We have found that 
wild-type TRPC6 protein expressed in HEK293 cells is 
phosphorylated even under resting condition, and the 
high basal phosphorylation masks the effects of cAMP￾elevating agents in vivo (10). Therefore, in vitro kinase 
assay with Phos-tag biotin has been improved to deter￾mine the phosphorylation sites of TRPC6 by PKA. 
Phos-tag biotin is a phosphate-specific ligand with biotin 
tag to detect specifically phosphorylated proteins (88). 
Before in vitro kinase assay, TRPC6 protein expressed 
in HEK293 cells is immunoprecipitated and the resulting 
immunoprecipitated TRPC6 protein is dephosphorylated 
by treatment with phosphatase to reduce its basal 
phosphorylation level (10). In vitro kinase assay with 
dephosphorylated wild-type and mutant TRPC6 proteins 
has revealed that PKA phosphorylates TRPC6 on Ser28
and Thr69 (Fig. 7C) (10). The results obtained from 
[Ca2+]i measurement study and in vitro kinase assay 
provide evidence that activation of the AC/cAMP/PKA 
signaling pathway inhibits TRPC6-mediated ROCE in 
response to ETAR stimulation by TRPC6 phosphoryla￾tion of Ser28 but not Thr69 (Fig. 8).
3.7. Regulation of ETAR-operated TRPC3 and TRPC6 
by STIM1 and its novel splice variant STIM1L
STIM1 is the ER Ca2+ sensor to control ER Ca2+ levels. 
Recent studies have identified a new splice variant of 
STIM1, named STIM1L, which is expressed in various 
tissues of rodents and in only the skeletal muscle of 
humans (Fig. 9A) (14, 89). The well-known human stim1
gene consists of twelve exons. Sequencing of the PCR 
product has identified a new sequence (318 bp segment) 
inserted between exons 11 and 12 of the well-known 
stim1 human gene (Fig. 9B). Therefore, STIM1L has a 
longer cytosolic C-terminal tail than STIM1 because the 
additional segment (106 amino acids) identified in 
STIM1L is inserted between positions 514 and 515 in the 
STIM1 amino acid sequence. Like STIM1, STIM1L is a 
single-pass transmembrane protein located mainly on the 
ER membrane and it senses a decrease in the Ca2+ level 
in ER to regulate SOCE. As regards the functional 
significance of STIM1L in the regulation of Ca2+ signal￾ing, it is reported that the interaction of STIM1L with 
actin filament through the STIM1L-specific segment 
allows rapid activation of SOCE mediated via Orai1 
channels in human skeletal muscle (89).
Our recent study has shown that mRNA for STIM1L 
is detected only in human skeletal muscle, whereas the 
well-known STIM1 is ubiquitously expressed in human 
tissues including heart, leukocyte, arterial smooth muscle 
cells, and venous ECs (Fig. 9A) (14). Both STIM1 and 
STIM1L exogenously expressed in HEK293 cells are 
diffusely distributed in the cytoplasm, presumably on ER 
(14). As already described in section 3.5., ETAR stimula￾tion induces only SOCE in HEK293 cells not transfected 
with TRPC channel (76). In HEK293 cells stably ex￾pressing ETAR, overexpression of STIM1 (Fig. 10B) 
and STIM1L (Fig. 10C) augments ET-1–induced SOCE, 
compared with control cells not transfected with them 
(Fig. 10A). The augmentation of ET-1–induced SOCE 
by STIM1L is significantly larger than that by STIM1 
(Fig. 10D), indicating that STIM1L acts more effectively 
to trigger SOCE than STIM1. The stronger enhancement 
of SOCE by STIM1L in comparison with STIM1 may 
be due to STIM1L’s ability to bind more strongly to the 
Orai1 channel than STIM1 (Fig. 10E), since the amount 
of STIM1L protein interacting with Orai1 is approxi￾mately 4-fold larger than that of STIM1 protein (Fig. 10F).
STIM1 is reported to bind not directly to TRPC3 
and TRPC6 exogenously expressed in HEK293 cells 
(65). As opposed to the previous report, our recent study 
has demonstrated that STIM1 weakly but definitely 
interacts with TRPC3 and TRPC6 (Fig. 11A) (14). Like 
Orai1, STIM1L interacts with TRPC3 and TRPC6 more 
strongly than STIM1 (Fig.   11A), indicating that the 
STIM1L-specific sequence plays an important role in the 
Fig. 8. Negative regulation of ETAR-activated TRPC6 channel by 
the AC/cAMP/PKA pathway. The activity of the TRPC6 channel is 
inhibited by PKA-mediated phosphorylation of TRPC6 at Ser28.

association of STIM1L with TRPC3 and TRPC6 (14). 
Interestingly, the TRPC3- (Fig.   11B) and TRPC6-
mediated ROCE (Fig. 11C) in response to ETAR stimula￾tion is suppressed following overexpression of STIM1 
and STIM1L (14). STIM1L tends to inhibit the TRPC3- 
and TRPC6-mediated ROCE more strongly than STIM1 
(Fig. 11: B and C). The slight difference in the inhibitory 
activities between STIM1 and STIM1L may result 
from the higher binding capacity of STIM1L to TRPC3 
and TRPC6 in comparison with STIM1. These findings 
suggest that STIM1 and STIM1L function as negative 
regulators of the ETAR-operated Ca2+ entry via TRPC3 
and TRPC6 and also suggest that the additional amino 
acid sequence of STIM1L at the cytosolic C-terminus is 
critical for regulating the protein–protein interaction and 
Ca2+ signaling.
4. Regulation of the ETR signaling by GIP
4.1. The discovery of GIPs
Growing evidence indicates that GPCRs physically 
and functionally interact not only with heterotrimeric 
G proteins but also with a variety of other proteins called 
GIPs (16 – 18, 90). GIPs play an important role in the 
G protein–independent regulation of GPCR pharmaco￾logy or signaling. A number of studies have shown that 
GIPs associate with intracellular loops, transmembrane 
and C-terminal domains of GPCRs. In particular, most 
GIPs target the GPCR C-terminus (from the end of TM7 
to the extreme C-terminus) that contains an additional 
series of identified domain (15). A large number of recent 
investigations have identified many GIPs that mediate or 
modulate GPCR signaling, trafficking, targeting, and/or 
ligand binding. For example, Suzuki et al. (91) have 
reported that the C terminus of a1A-adrenergic receptor 
(a1A-AR) interacts with Snapin which is originally 
identified as a binding protein of SNAP-25, one of the 
components of the SNARE (soluble NSF attachment 
protein receptor) complex (92), enhancing the interaction 
of synaptotagmin, a potent Ca2+ sensor, with the SNARE 
complex (92, 93). Snapin interacts with TRPC6 in 
addition to the a1A-AR, resulting in augmentation of a1A￾AR-operated Ca2+ entry via TRPC6 in rat pheochromo￾cytoma-derived PC12 cells (91). Regarding GIPs for 
many GPCRs, refer to several excellent reviews (15 – 18, 
94 – 96). This review will focus on the GIPs associated 
with the C-terminal region of ETAR and/or ETBR: the 
eNOS (97), the histone acetyltransferase (Tip60) (98), 
the histone deacetylase (HDAC7) (98), and Jun activa￾tion domain-binding protein 1 (Jab1) (19).
4.2. Implication of ETR interacting proteins (eNOS, 
Tip60, and HDAC7) in the signal transduction of 
ETRs

mRNAs. A) The size of full-length cDNAs of STIM1 and STIM1L are 2,058 bp and 2,376 bp, respectively. Although the mRNA 
of STIM1 is ubiquitously expressed in human tissues including skeletal muscle, left ventricle, brain, placentae, leukocyte, 
pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells (PASMC), umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), HeLa cells, and human embryonic 
kidney 293 (HEK293) cells, mRNA of STIM1L is detected in only skeletal muscle. The positions of size markers are indicated to 
the left in bp. B) The STIM1L-specific segment (318 bp) is present immediately after exon 11 in the human STIM1 sequence.

Endothelin Receptor Signaling 95
fusion proteins have demonstrated that the interaction of 
eNOS with the C-terminus (residues 390 – 409) of ETBR 
results in the inhibition of eNOS activity (97). In ECs, 
stimulation of ETBR with ET-1 induces an increase in 
[Ca2+]i, accompanied by activation of eNOS via associa￾tion of Ca2+-CaM with the Ca2+-CaM–binding domain of 
eNOS. Therefore, activity of eNOS is positively regu￾lated by ETBR-mediated Ca2+ mobilization but negatively 
controlled by interactions with the C-terminus of ETBR.
A study using different types of experiments (yeast 
two-hybrid analysis, GST pull-down assay, and co￾immunoprecipitation assay) has revealed that both Tip60 
and HDAC7 interact with the C-terminal region (residues 
365 – 420) of ETAR (98). Before stimulation of ETAR 
with ET-1, ETAR is predominantly present in the plasma 
membrane, while Tip60 and HDAC7 are localized 
mainly in the cell nucleus. This finding suggests that 
Tip60 and HDAC7 neither colocalize nor interact with 
ETAR under the resting condition. On the other hand, 
activation of ETAR in response to ET-1 results in both 
internalization of ETAR to the perinuclear compartment 
and mobilization of Tip60 and HDAC7 from the nucleus 
to the same perinuclear compartment where each GIP 
colocalizes with ETAR. The ligand-dependent interaction 
of Tip60 with ETAR strongly potentiates ET-1–induced 
phosphorylation of ERK1/2, whereas the association of 
HDAC7 with the receptor has no significant effect. The 
molecular mechanisms underlying the ETAR-mediated

nuclear export of Tip60 and HDAC7 and the augmenta￾tion of ET-1–induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation by Tip60 
remain unclear. The possibility arises that Tip60 inhibits 
degradation of ETAR by re-routing the receptor from 
lysosomes to the recycling pathway, because overexpres￾sion of Tip60 increases the expression level of ETAR 
(98).
4.3. Regulation of ETAR and ETBR signalings by Jab1
The data of Masaki and colleagues (8, 99) provide 
several important insights into the role of ETR C-terminus 
in the regulation of receptor signaling, trafficking, and/or 
targeting. Our recent study with the yeast two-hybrid 
screening system of adult human heart cDNA library 
has identified Jab1 as an ETAR-interacting protein, 
which associates with the C-terminal region (residues 
373 – 427) of ETAR (19). Evidence from GST pull-down 
assay and coimmunoprecipitation study has supported 
the interaction of ETAR with Jab1 (19). In HEK293 cells 
stably coexpressing ETAR and Jab1, ETAR is predomi￾nantly localized at the plasma membrane, while Jab1 is 
diffusely distributed in the cytosol and nucleus (19). 
The overlay image visualized with confocal microscopy 
indicates that Jab1 colocalizes with ETAR on the peri￾phery of the cells (19). Similarly, coimmunoprecipitation 
experiments have revealed that Jab1 interacts with ETBR 
as well as with ETAR (19).
Jab1 has been originally discovered as a protein inter￾Fig. 11. Binding property of STIM1 and STIM1L to TRPC3 and TRPC6 (A) and negative regulation of ETAR-operated Ca2+

expressed STIM1-myc and STIM1L-myc were detected with anti-myc monoclonal antibody (IB: a-myc). The histograms

acting with c-Jun that combines with Fos protein to 
form a gene regulatory protein complex, AP-1 (100). In 
addition to ETAR and c-Jun, Jab1 binds to p27Kip1 (101), 
p53 (102), and lutropin/choriogonadotropin receptor 
precursor (103), resulting in an acceleration of their 
degradation. It is well-known that the selective protein 
degradation requires the activation of the ubiquitin￾dependent proteolytic pathway (104). Interestingly, 
overexpression of Jab1 facilitates ubiquitination of its 
interacting partners (105, 106). Ubiquitination of proteins 
results from the sequential action of the ubiquitin￾activating enzyme (E1), ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme 
(E2), and in some cases ubiquitin-protein ligase (E3) 
(104). Jab1 is a member of the COP9 signalosome that 
plays a key role in sustaining the activity of SCF (Skp1-
Cul1-F-box) and other cullin-based ubiquitin ligases 
(107). Therefore, the functional significance of Jab1 in 
the regulation of ETR degradation and ubiquitination has 
been examined.
In HEK293 cells stably expressing ETAR, overexpres￾sion of Jab1 significantly decreases the whole cell and 
cell surface expression level of ETAR in comparison with 
control cells not transfected with Jab1 (19). In contrast, 
knockdown of Jab1 with siRNA increases the ETAR level 
when compared with the cells transfected with scrambled 
(control) siRNA (19). Cycloheximide chase assays for 
determining the degradation rate of protein have shown 
that Jab1 overexpression increases the rate of dis￾appearance for ETAR (19). ETAR is ubiquitinated under 
the resting state, and the level of ubiquitination is 
enhanced by Jab1 overexpression (19). Prolonged stimu￾lation of ETAR with ET-1 decreases the expression level 
of ETAR, along with an increase in the amount of Jab1 
bound to the receptor (19). These results clearly indicate 
that the interaction of Jab1 with ETAR facilitates the 
degradation of ETAR by enhancing its ubiquitination 
(Fig. 12).
The negative regulation of ETAR expression level 
by Jab1 is closely correlated with the receptor signaling. 
In HEK293 cells exogenously expressing ETAR, stimula￾tion of ETAR with ET-1 induces phosphorylation of 
ERK1/2 (19). The ET-1–induced ERK1/2 phosphoryla￾tion is decreased by Jab1 overexpression but augmented 
by Jab1 knockdown (19). These findings suggest that 
Jab1 regulates ETAR-mediated intracellular signaling by 
modulating the ETAR expression levels.
Coimmunoprecipitation studies provide evidence that 
Jab1 interacts with ETBR as well as with ETAR (19). It is 
reported that ETAR is primarily targeted to the recycling 
pathway, while ETBR is exclusively targeted to the 
lysosomal pathway for degradation (108 – 110). There￾fore, ETBR is more rapidly degraded than ETAR follow￾ing their stimulation with ET-1. Notably, the amount of 
Jab1 associated with ETBR and the ubiquitination level 
of ETBR are markedly higher than those for ETAR (19). 
These results indicate that the difference in the degrada￾tion rate between ETAR and ETBR results from the differ￾ent amount of Jab1 bound to the receptors and subsequent 
ubiquitination level between ETAR and ETBR.

mechanism of ETAR expression

5. Conclusions and perspectives
The ET system plays an important role in pathogenesis 
and development of various diseases including hyper￾tension, atherosclerosis, and insulin resistance. The 
signaling, trafficking and localization of ETR are tightly 
regulated by G protein–dependent and –independent 
mechanisms. ROCCs such as TRPC channels and GIPs 
such as Jab1 are essential components to finely tune 
receptor pharmacology. Future advances in research 
focusing on the downstream targets of agonist-activated 
ETRs could provide insights into the pathogenesis and 
therapy of diseases responsible for abnormalities in the 
ET system.
