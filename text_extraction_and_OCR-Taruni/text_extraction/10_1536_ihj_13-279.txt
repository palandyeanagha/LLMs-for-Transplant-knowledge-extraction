Summary
Although survival after heart transplantation (HTx) has improved in recent years, cardiac allograft vasculopathy 
(CAV) is still the leading cause of remote morbidity and mortality in HTx recipients, partly because of diffi culty with its 
diagnosis. In general, routine surveillance for CAV is advocated with coronary angiography accompanied by intravascu￾lar ultrasound (IVUS) if necessary. However, these modalities have limitations with respect to low spatial resolution, and 
suffi cient qualitative/quantitative assessment of coronary intima has not been accomplished. Recently, optical coherence 
tomography (OCT) has emerged as a novel intracoronary imaging technique using an optical analogue of ultrasound 
with a spatial resolution of 10-20 µm, which is 10 times greater than IVUS. We here experienced a 49-year-old male 
who received a HTx 3 years ago, and OCT was executed during low molecular weight dextran injection. OCT demon￾strated distinct double intimal layers probably consisting of a donor-transmitted atherosclerotic layer and an inner intimal 
proliferation due to CAV, which was indistinguishable by IVUS and virtual histological analyses. We believe that OCT 
imaging is not only a new loadstar during treatment of CAV but also a new generation modality for screening for early 
CAV in HTx recipients. (Int Heart J 2014; 55: 178-180)

A lthough major improvements have been made in sur￾gical techniques and treatments for acute rejection, 
accelerated cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) 
still limits the remote survival in heart transplantation (HTx) 
recipients.1) CAV is a pathologically multifaceted disorder that 
affects epicardial coronary arteries with different types of le￾sions including intimal fi bromuscular hyperplasia, atheroscle￾rosis, and infl ammation.2) In distinction from general coronary 
atherosclerosis, which is marked by focal and eccentric fi bro￾fatty atheroma, CAV involves the entire coronary vasculature 
diffusely with marked intimal proliferation and concentric vas￾cular thickening and fi brosis.3) Typically, HTx recipients do not 
experience angina because of perioperative denervation, but 
eventually present with left ventricular dysfunction as a conse￾quence of progressed myocardial ischemia.4) Therefore, an In￾ternational Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation 
(ISHLT) working group recommended regular surveys with 
coronary angiography regardless of the recipient’s symptoms 
for early detection of CAV, accompanied by subsequent IVUS 
when CAV is suspected.5)
Recently, optical coherence tomography (OCT) has 
emerged as a new generation catheter-based modality that ac￾quires images at a spatial resolution of 10-20 µm, enabling vis￾ualization of blood vessel wall microstructure in vivo at an un￾precedented level of detail.6) However, little is known about 
adaptation of OCT for analyses of CAV. Hence, we experi￾enced a chance to conduct OCT along with coronary angiogra￾phy and IVUS in a heart transplantation (HTx) recipient, and 
discuss the utility of OCT.
Case Report
In 2010, a 46-year-old male with dilated cardiomyopathy 
received a HTx from a male adult donor after undergoing 2 
years of left ventricular assist device support. His postoperative

tatin, except for 1 instance of cellular rejection with ISHLT 
grade 3A at 3 weeks after HTx, which was treated by steroid 
pulse therapy. At 3 months after HTx, diffuse slight plaque at a 
mid to proximal site of the left anterior descending coronary 
artery (LAD) was observed by intravascular ultrasound 
(IVUS). After detection of diffuse mild plaque at a mid to 
proximal site of the LAD by IVUS at 6 months after HTx, 
mycophenolate mophetil was switched to everolimus. Pred￾nisolone was tapered off in August 2012.
In August 2013, he was admitted to our hospital for regu￾lar follow-up. His height and weight were 180 cm and 66 kg. 
His plasma B-type natriuretic peptide concentration was 56.4 
pg/mL, and his serum creatinine concentration was 1.12 mg/
dL on admission. Trough concentrations of tacrolimus and 
everolimus were 6.7 and 3.9 ng/mL, respectively. His ejection 
fraction on transthoracic echocardiography by Simpson’s bi￾plane method was 67% with a left ventricular end-diastolic di￾ameter of 46 mm. Cytomegalovirus antigenemia and %panel 
reactive activity were assayed but both were negative.
According to a hemodynamic study and endomyocardial 
biopsy, his intracardiac pressure was normal together with no 
cellular rejection (ISHLT grade 0) and no complement deposi￾tion. Coronary angiography indicated no signifi cant stenosis in 
any coronary artery (Figure 1A and B). IVUS images were re￾corded (iLabTM, Boston Scientific, Corporation, Natick MA) 
from the mid portion to the left main coronary artery with an 
automated pullback system at a speed of 0.5 mm/s, using a 
2.5F, 40-MHz IVUS catheter (AtlantisTM SR Pro, Boston Sci￾entifi c Corporation, Natick, MA, USA). Analyzed IVUS im￾ages showed diffuse concentric plaque at a mid to proximal 
site of the LAD (maximal %plaque area was 38.4% at the mid 
site) (Figures 1C and F). iMAP images (Boston Scientifi c Cor￾poration) revealed histological tissue characterization of the 
LAD, and over 70% of the intimal area was occupied with fi -
brotic component (Figures 1D and G). Subsequently, the IVUS 
catheter was replaced with a 2.7F OCT catheter (C8 Dragon￾FlyTM JP, St Jude Medical, St Paul, MN, USA). During low 
molecular weight dextran injection for the clearance of blood 
(30 mL at 4 mL/s by power injection), OCT images (C8-XRTM
system, ILUMIENTM OPTISTM Imaging system, St Jude Medi￾cal) were recorded from the mid to proximal portion of the 
LAD at an automatic pull-back speed of 20 mm/s and a frame 
rate of 100/s. Three layers of components consisting of intima, 
media, and adventitia were observed separately. Moreover, 
double homogenous intimal layers that were separated by a 
thin threshold line were observed (Figures 1E, H, and I).
Discussion
Considering the future of coronary angiography that visu￾alizes only the coronary lumen and CAV that facilitates diffuse 
and concentric proliferation of intima, an early diagnosis of 
CAV only by coronary angiography is sometimes diffi cult. In 
contrast, IVUS can quantify coronary plaque, and some recent 
investigators recommend IVUS for routine surveillance of 
CAV.7) Consistently, although there appeared to be no angio￾graphic stenosis in the LAD in the present case (Figure 1A and 
B), mild plaque was detected at a mid to proximal site of the 
LAD by IVUS analyses (Figure 1D and E). However, intimal 
thickening is only indirectly evaluated as the intima-media 
thickening by IVUS because the boundary of intima and media 
cannot be distinguished by this method as shown also in the 
present case.8) OCT is a new imaging procedure with a spatial 
resolution of approximately 10-20 µm, which is 10-fold greater 
than that of IVUS.6) As shown in Figures 1E and H, OCT 
could obviously identify the layer of media as a lower-echoic 
line, which could not be identifi ed by IVUS. When assessing 
the quality of an intracoronary structure accurately, OCT 
seems to have more potential than IVUS.9)
Although few reports have performed OCT analyses for 
CAV,10,11) Cassar, et al introduced “layered complex plaque” as 
one of the advanced types of CAV. They speculated that such 
multi-layer patterns consisting of multi-components within in￾timal thickening may be a pathological hallmark of repeatedly 
healed intimal erosions through progression of CAV.12) We 
could detect a clear and pronounced boundary line within the 
intimal layer at the mid to proximal site in the LAD, but both 
layers seemed homogeneous. Consistently, iMAP images, 
which are obtained by using a pattern recognition algorithm on 
the spectra obtained from a fast Fourier transformation and 
histology-derived database,13) could not distinguish between 
the 2 intimal layers histologically. Both layers mainly consist￾ed of a fi brotic component. Soon after HTx, we observed only 
slight diffuse plaque at the mid to proximal site in the LAD by 
IVUS imaging, which must have been donor-transmitted 
atherosclerosis. Considering these results, there may be 2 mo￾no-component intimal layers consisting of donor-transmitted 
atherosclerosis (shown as “Id” in Figure 1E and H) and succes￾sive inner intimal proliferation due to CAV after HTx (shown 
as “Ic” in Figure 1E and H), which could not be distinguished 
by conventional modalities other than OCT. Repeated observa￾tion of the inner layer by OCT imaging would strengthen this 
double layer hypothesis.
Statins,14) vasodilators,15) and immunosuppressive agents 
such as mycophenolate mofetil 16) and everolimus 17) are used to 
treat CAV. However, there have been no standardized loadstars

for the treatment of CAV thus far. Quantitational assay of inti￾mal thickening purely due to CAV separated from donor-trans￾mitted atherosclerosis by OCT imaging would become a key 
loadstar for assessing the effectiveness of a specifi c treatment 
against CAV. Moreover, by distinguishing newly developed 
CAV from donor-transmitted atherosclerosis, an early and ac￾curate diagnosis of CAV may be feasible.
Should OCT be recommended for all HTx recipients as a 
screening procedure? Different from IVUS, OCT imaging re￾quires displacement of red blood cells from the vessel lumen 
during the procedure, and this is generally accomplished by 
using radiographic contrast.18) However, there is concern that 
injection of radiographic contrast would worsen renal dysfunc￾tion because HTx recipients often have higher levels of serum 
creatinine due to daily administration of immunosuppressive 
agents, like in the present patient.19) We adopted here low mo￾lecular weight dextran instead of radiographic contrast, as rec￾ommended by Frick, et al.
20) The quality of OCT images was 
equally high and suffi cient to be analyzed compared with those 
with conventional radiographic contrast. We would like to em￾phasize that OCT imaging during low molecular weight dex￾tran injection may be a novel new generation procedure for 
routine surveillance of CAV in HTx recipients.
