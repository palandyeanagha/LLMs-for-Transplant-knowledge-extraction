Abstract
A review is presented of the clinical and morphological manifestations of lymphangioleio￾myomatosis（LAM）, a systemic disorder of unknown etiology that affects women. The clinical
features include dyspnea, hemoptysis, recurrent pneumothorax, chylothorax, and chylous ascites.
It is characterized by: 1）proliferation of abnormal smooth muscle cells（LAM cells）in pulmonary
interstitium and along the axial lymphatics of the thorax and abdomen; 2）thin-walled pulmonary
cysts, and 3）a high incidence of angiomyolipomas. The pulmonary cystic lesions have a charac￾teristic appearance on high resolution computed tomography. The most specific method for diag￾nosing LAM is lung biopsy to demonstrate the presence of LAM cells, either by their characteris￾tic histological appearance or by specific immunostaining with HMB―45 antibody. LAM cells dif￾fer in several important respects from the types of smooth muscle cells normally present in lung.
Their reactivity with HMB―45 antibody is localized in stage I and stage II melanosomes. LAM
cells show additional evidence of incomplete melanogenesis, and the significance of these obser￾vations remains to be determined. Two types of LAM cells are recognized: 1）small, spindle￾shaped cells that are centrally located in the LAM nodules and are highly immunoreactive for
matrix metalloproteinase―2（MMP―2）, its activating enzyme（MT―1―MMP）, and proliferating cell
nuclear antigen（PCNA）, and 2）large, epithelioid cells that are distributed along the periphery
of the nodules and show a high degree of immunoreactivity with HMB―45 antibody and with anti￾bodies against estrogen and progesterone receptors. Types of treatment used for LAM include
oophorectomy, administration of Lupron or progesterone and in very severe cases, pulmonary
transplantation（following the onset of respiratory insufficiency, not relieved by O2）（J Nippon .

and along the axial lymphatics of the thorax and abdo￾men; 2）formation of thin-walled cysts（Fig. 1 A）that
are distributed diffusely throughout the lungs , and
3）a high incidence of angiomyolipomas3,4. The gross
anatomical , histological and radiological features of
these lesions are illustrated in Figs. 1 A, 1 B, and 2 A
to 2 F. The LAM cells are thought to be derived from
perivascular cells that are located along the walls of
lymphatic vessels（see Travis et al.5 for review）. The
disease is most often sporadic . However , it also has
been reported to occur in about 3％ of female patients
with tuberous sclerosis complex（TSC）5,6, a genetically
transmitted disorder resulting from mutations in one
of two genes, TSC 1 or TSC 27
. It appears that female
patients with TSC have a significant incidence of
pneumothorax and cystic pulmonary lesions6
, and this
association is more frequent than was previously
believed, as suggested by a recent study6 that demon￾strated a high incidence of spontaneous pneumotho￾rax and cystic pulmonary lesions in patients who had
tuberous sclerosis but had no pulmonary symptoms.
Clinical Findings
The disease is characterized clinically by dyspnea,
hemoptysis , recurrent pneumothorax , evidence of
chylothorax, chylous ascites or chylopericardium, and
abdominal masses, which may represent either mas￾sively enlarged lymph nodes or angiomyolipomas8－11 .
The abdominal masses may be asymptomatic or may
cause non-specific symptoms. In some patients they
are the initial manifestation of LAM, and investigation
of such lesions can lead to the previously unsuspected
diagnosis of pulmonary LAM12.
In a series of 69 patients examined by Urban et al11,
LAM was diagnosed after menopause in about 10％ of
cases. LAM was first recognized during pregnancy in
20％ of cases, and clear exacerbation of LAM was ob￾served during pregnancy in 14％ of cases. In this se￾ries of patients, chylothorax was observed in 29％ of
patients during the overall course of the disease with
recurrence in 6; chylous ascites was diagnosed in 12％
of patients. The abdominal masses observed included
angiomyolipomas, which were found in 32％ of the pa￾tients , abdominal lymphadenopathy , found in 24％ ,
and uterine leiomyomas , which occurred in 41％ of
the patients.
Bronchoalveolar Lavage
Chu et al.10 reported the results of bronchoalveolar
lavage（BAL）in six normal female volunteers（age,
38.2±10.8 years）and 16 LAM patients（ 39.4± 7.2
years）with FEV145％ of predicted value and PaO2
65 mmHg. The total amounts of cells recovered per
BAL, the number of cells per milliliter of lavage fluid,
and the numbers of cells per microliter of epithelial
lining fluid（ELF）were similar in both groups. The
percentage of lavage fluid recovered was significantly
lower, and the relative amounts of ELF in lavage fluid
were significantly higher in LAM patients. The differ￾ential cell counts in BAL fluid were similar in LAM
patients and control subjects . Pigment-laden macro￾phages were present in BAL fluid in 13 LAM patients
and 2 normal subjects . The percentage of pigment￾Fig．1 Anatomical and Radiological features of

laden macrophages in LAM patients was significantly
higher than in normal subjects.
Radiological Findings
The pulmonary cysts in LAM are rarely evident on
routine chest radiographs . Only 8％ of the patients
have cysts shown by radiographs , whereas 100％
have cysts shown by high resolution chest tomogra￾phy（HRCT）13. On HRCTs, the cysts appear to be dis￾tributed homogeneously in both lungs（Fig. 1 B）. In a
few patients, the cysts are slightly less numerous in

the upper than in the lower lung zones. The extent of
pulmonary cysts varies widely among the patients .
The size of the cysts may range from a few millime￾ters to several centimeters10.
Other abnormalities on CT of the chest included
retrocrural adenopathy in nine patients, pleural effu￾sion in five, dilated thoracic duct in four, pericardial ef￾fusion in two, and pneumothorax in two. Among five
patients with pleural effusions, four had chylous effu￾sions and one had an effusion that was too small for
thoracentesis. In 22 patients, CT and ultrasonography
revealed solid renal masses. Nine of the the patients
had multiple masses and 6 had bilateral masses. A to￾tal of 51 solid renal masses were observed, 34 in the
left kidney and 17 in the right . The average size of
these masses was 14±1.6 cm. The angiomyolipomas
had a characteristic appearance on HRCT of the abdo￾men（Fig . 2 A） and were hyperechoic on ultra￾sonographic study . Retroperitoneal adenopathy was
found in 27 of the patients studied by Chu et al10. Fat
attenuation in retroperitoneal lymph nodes was ob￾served in 8 patients. Pelvic adenopathy was observed
in 4 patients. Lymphangiography（Fig. 2 B）was found
to be useful to demonstrate retroperitoneal involve￾ment by LAM. Three patients had other findings, in￾cluding unilateral, single renal cysts in 3 patients. All
renal cysts were1 cm in diameter.
In a recent study by Avila et al14, 80 patients with
LAM underwent chest and abdominopelvic CT and
ultrasonography. The abdominal findings were com￾pared with the severity of pulmonary disease in
HRCT. Sixty-one（76％）of the 80 patients had positive
abdominal findings, including renal angiomyolipomas
in 43 patients（54％）, enlarged abdominal lymph nodes
in 31（39％）, and lymphangiomyoma in 13（16％）. Less
common abnormalities included ascites in 8（10％）, di￾lation of the thoracic duct in 7（9％）, and hepatic an￾giomyolipomas in 3（4％）. There was a significant cor￾relation between enlarged abdominal lymph nodes
and greater severity of the lung disease.
Pulmonary Function Studies
Three aspects of pulmonary function have been the
subject of special attention in LAM: the rate of decline
of FEV1, the decrease in DLCO, the obstruction of air￾flow and its response to bronchodilators15,16 . Lazor et
al.17 examined serial FEV1 measurements in 50 cases
of LAM with a mean follow-up of 5± 4 years . The
mean rate of FEV1 decline, determined by linear re￾gression, was ―115±176 ml year. To evaluate predic￾tive factors of rapid deterioration, they compared the
2 extremes of the study population, respectively de￾fined by rates of FEV1 decline25th percentile and
75th percentile. The author concluded that there was
no significant difference between the 2 groups in
symptoms and signs, use of oral contraceptives, preg￾nancy, menopause , angiomyolipoma , pneumothorax ,
chylothorax , chylous ascites , initial FEV1, results of
imaging, or hormonal treatment. The data suggested
that the absence of uterine leiomyomas, lower initial
DLCO, and lower initial PaCO2, were associated with a
more rapid rate of FEV1 decline in pulmonary LAM.
Taveira-Da Silva et al .18 found reversible obstruc￾tion of airflow in 25％ of 143 patients with LAM. A re￾sponse to bronchodilators was associated with a
higher proportion of LAM cells in lung biopsy speci￾mens and with a greater decline of airflow. Inflamma￾tion of the airways was found in 61％ of 74 lung speci￾mens examined, but did not correlate with obstruc￾tion to airflow. The latter, whether fixed or reversible,
did not correlate with the severity of the disease .
However, DLCO was a useful predictor . Taveira-Da
Silva et al .18 concluded that a positive response to
bronchodilators was found in patients with acceler￾ated loss of lung function, and that the degree of im￾pairment of DLCO correlated with the severity of the
disease.
To assess the correlations between the results of
pulmonary function tests and ventilation-perfusion
scintigrams, CT scans, and chest radiographs, Avila et
al.13 studied 39 patients with LAM . Imaging abnor￾malities were found on 92％ of perfusion scintigrams,
79％ of chest radiographs, 100％ of CT scans, and 100
％ of HRCT. On ventilation scintigrams, 28（72％）of
the patients demonstrated a speckling pattern. On CT
scans, all patients had pulmonary cysts. The extent of
disease on chest radiographs and CT scans, cyst size,
ventilation-perfusion abnormalities , and degree of
speckling were inversely correlated with FEV1 , and
the ratio of FEV1 to forced vital capacity（FVC）but
not with FVC and total lung capacity.

Differential Diagnosis
LAM must be distinguished from other pulmonary
disorders associated with proliferation of smooth mus￾cle cells or formation of parenchymal cysts, or both5
.
As discussed in detail by Travis et al.5
, these disorders
are most commonly distinguished from LAM on the
basis of HRCT and histologic study of pulmonary tis￾sue. Diseases to be considered in the differential diag￾nosis of proliferation of pulmonary smooth muscle ce￾lls include idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis , chronic
stages of hypersensitivity pneumonitis, primary pul￾monary leiomyomata , benign metastasizing leio￾myomata and pulmonary leiomyosarcomas . In most
instances, the correct diagnosis can be established by
histologic study; however, specific immunostaining of
LAM cells with HMB―45 antibody（see below）can be
very useful in the evaluation of these problems, since
the smooth muscle cells in other pulmonary disorders
are unreactive with this antibody19.
Various cystic disorders of the lung can be easily
distinguished from LAM on the basis of their appear￾ance on HRCT imaging14 . In this category, the most
important entity to exclude is pulmonary Langerhans'
cell granulomatosis （ pulmonary histiocytosis X ）,
which is associated with recurrent pneumothorax and
with formation of parenchymal cysts. The diagnosis of
this disorder can be established by the demonstration
of increased numbers of Langerhans' cells in BAL
fluid andor by the specific identification of these cells
（either by immunohistochemical staining with OT―10
antibody or by the ultrastructural demonstration of
their specific Birbeck granules）20, 21. Langerhans' cells
do not react with HMB―45 antibody. In addition , in
PLCG, the HRCT shows nodules as well as cysts with
more involvement of the upper lobes and sparing of
the costophrenic angles.
Gross Anatomic Findings
Gross anatomic findings in the lungs are distinctive,
with diffuse, bilateral cystic changes throughout. The
lungs are enlarged , as in severe emphysema . Most
cysts are 0.5―2 cm in size, but in some cases they can
measure over 10 cm. The diffuse nature of the cystic
changes in pulmonary LAM can be best appreciated
by inspection of the cut surfaces of the lungs, using a
dissecting microscope and incident light illumination
（Fig. 1 A）.
Histologic Findings
Pulmonary LAM: In the early stages of the dis￾ease, the infiltrates of LAM cells may be overlooked
and the biopsy misinterpreted as showing either em￾physema or normal lung. The LAM cells are typically
found in small clusters or nests at the edges of the
cysts and along pulmonary blood vessels, lymphatics
and bronchioles（Fig. 2 C）. The infiltration of LAM
cells in the walls of vessels and distal airways can lead
to vascular destruction and foci of hemosiderosis;
bronchiolar obliteration also may occur. The prolifer￾ating LAM cells grow in nodular or haphazard ar￾rangements, unlike the orderly, concentric or parallel
patterns of normal smooth muscle cells in the airways
and blood vessels . Mitotic figures and cytologically
atypical cells are rare. A definitive diagnosis of LAM
is made on the basis of the identification of LAM cells
in lung biopsy specimens. The LAM cells are morpho￾logically heterogeneous5 and can be classified into two
major types: 1）smaller, spindle-shaped cells（which
may appear rounded or oval depending upon the
plane of sectioning）, and 2）larger, epithelioid LAM
cells with more abundant cytoplasm（Fig. 2 D）. These
two types of LAM cells have different distributions in
the LAM nodules , in which the smaller , spindle￾shaped cells are centrally located, whereas the epithe￾lioid cells tend to occur in peripheral regions of the
nodules . These observations and the immunohisto￾chemical studies described below have led to the con￾cept that the LAM cells replicate in the central re￾gions of the nodules and undergo progressive growth
and differentiation as they migrate to the periphery of
the nodules22 . In the late stages of the disease , the
LAM cells are more irregularly arranged, particularly
along the walls of the cysts , and are admixed with
variable amounts of connective tissue22.
The pulmonary parenchymal cysts in LAM are
characterized by progressive dilatation of the air
spaces, and this alteration is associated with hyperpla￾sia of type II pneumocytes23 and destructive changes
J Nippon Med Sch 2000; 67（5） 315

in the elastic fibers and collagen in the walls of the
cysts , which undergo progressive thinning23 . Prote￾olytic enzymes released by the LAM cells are thought
to play a critical role in the formation of these cysts.
Recent studies have indicated that matrix metallopro￾teinases（MMPs）may be responsible for at least part
of this damage24. It has been suggested that an imbal￾ance in the α-1-antitrypsin system also may play a
role in the proteolytic damage , but data to support
this concept are lacking25.
The hyperplasia of type II pneumocytes can be
found in areas that do not show accumulations of
LAM cells23 . In contrast to these changes , focal mi￾cronodular hyperplasia of type II pneumocytes has
been observed as a distinctive lesion in patients with
tuberous sclerosis5 with or without LAM . These le￾sions consist of ill-defined nodular masses composed of
alveoli lined by numerous type II pneumocytes. These
nodules often are adjacent to focal areas of emphyse￾matous change, and it has been suggested that they
induce obstruction to airflow5
.
Extrapulmonary LAM: Matsui et al .26 described
the lesions of extrapulmonary LAM that affected
lymph nodes of the mediastinum and retroperitoneum
in 22 cases in which histopathologic study was neces￾sary to establish the diagnosis. In a majority of these
patients, the diagnosis of extrapulmonary LAM pre￾ceded that of pulmonary LAM, usually by 1 to 2 years.
Eleven patients had distinct symptoms, including chy￾lous pleural effusion andor ascites , abdominal pain
and other palpable masses. In the other 11 patients,
the masses caused no symptoms. Well-circumscribed,
encapsulated masses, measuring up to 20 cm in size,
occurred in the mediastinum in two patients, the up￾per retroperitoneum in 15, extensive areas of the
retroperitoneum in 2, and the pelvis in 3. Masses ex￾ceeding 3 cm in diameter contained large , multiple
cysts filled with yellow-tan chylous fluid . Histologi￾cally, the masses were characterized by a prolifera￾tion of LAM cells arranged in fascicular（Fig. 2 E）, tra￾becular, and papillary patterns, which were associated
with slit-like vascular channels. In several cases, the
proliferation of LAM cells extended beyond the con￾nective tissue capsule of the extrapulmonary mass .
The LAM cells varied from small, spindle-shaped cells
to large epithelioid cells. Immunohistochemical stud￾ies showed strong reactivity of most LAM cells for α￾smooth muscle actin and smooth muscle myosin
heavy chains and a weak to moderate reactivity of a
lesser number of cells for desmin and nonmuscle
myosin heavy chain II-B. These reactivities are simi￾lar to those observed in pulmonary LAM cells（see be￾low）12. A reaction with HMB-45 and antibodies against
estrogen and progesterone receptors was observed
mainly in epithelioid LAM cells. These patterns of re￾activity are similar to those observed in LAM cells in
pulmonary lesions. However, the chylous cysts are not
a feature of pulmonary LAM and are thought to re￾sult from obstruction of lymphatics.
Some of the lesions of extrapulmonary LAM have
very unusual clinical and pathological manifestations.
In 2 of the 22 patients studied by Matsui et al.26,LAM
affected the retroperitoneal lymph nodes and was as￾sociated with endosalpingiosis. At laparotomy. large,
encapsulated masses with multiple cysts containing
chylous fluid were resected from these two patients.
Histologically, both were characterized by proliferat￾ing LAM cells that were histologically similar to those
found in extrapulmonary LAM lesions in other pa￾tients. In both patients, some cysts were lined by cili￾ated epithelium resembling that of Fallopian tubes .
Other cysts were lined either by flattened endothelial
cells （ identified by specific immunohistochemical
markers）or by a mixture of these cells and epithelial
cells. Many of the LAM cells, especially those subja￾cent to the epithelial cells , gave a positive reaction
with HMB―45 antibody. Manifestations of pulmonary
LAM have continued to be minimal in both patients,
at 1 and 6 years after operation, respectively.
Angiomyolipomas: As mentioned above, angiomy￾olipomas are frequent in patients with LAM, including
those in whom the disorder is associated with tuber￾ous sclerosis. These tumors have three major compo￾nents: LAM cells, which give a positive reaction with
HMB―45 antibody; fragments of immature or poorly
developed blood vessels, and large amounts of adipose
tissue5
（Fig. 2 F）. The latter can impart a character￾istic radiological appearance to these tumors . They
can grow to very large sizes and present difficult di￾agnostic problems. The relationship of these tumors
to other lesions of LAM is poorly understood . Simi￾larly, their high content of adipose tissue cells, which
316 J Nippon Med Sch 2000; 67（5）

is not a feature of other lesions of LAM, remains unex￾plained.
Scanning Electron Microscopy
Scanning electron microscopic studies demonstrate
the dilatation of the air spaces and the formation of
cysts in lungs from patients with LAM23（Figs. 3 A to
3 C）. In accord with the histologic observations cited
above, the surfaces of the cysts often contained abnor￾mally numerous type II pneumocytes. The apical sur￾faces of these cells are characterized by abundant mi￾crovilli（Fig. 3 C）, thus differing clearly from those of
type I pneumocytes, which are flat and lack surface
projections. Nodules of LAM cells also are clearly dis￾tinguishable in cross sections of the walls of the cysts
（Fig. 3 B）. Surfaces of the pulmonary cystic lesions in
LAM differ from those in pulmonary emphysema, in

µm）.

which they are flat and are lined mostly by type I
pneumocytes23.
Transmission Electron Microscopy
Transmission electron microscopic studies of LAM
cells are consistent with their identification as a type
of smooth muscle cells . The LAM cells are sur￾rounded by distinct basement membranes and con￾tain variable numbers of thin（6―8 nm in diameter）cy￾toplasmic filaments that correspond immunohisto￾chemically to smooth muscle F-actin25 . In addition ,
they contain intermediate（10 nm）filaments, which
correspond to desmin and often are distributed in the
perinuclear region . Desmin filaments are limited in
distribution to muscle cells27. However, LAM cells also
give a positive reaction for vimentin, an intermediate
filament protein that is known to be present in a wide
variety of cells of mesenchymal origin27 . Peripherally
located dense bodies, presumed to be analogous to the
Z-lines of cardiac and skeletal muscle, are present in
LAM cells（Fig. 4 A）, but are less prominent than in
other types of smooth muscle cells. Such dense bodies
represent insertion sites for the actin filaments. The
nuclei of LAM cells usually are elongated and contain
normally dispersed heterochromatin. Rough-surfaced
endoplasmic reticulum often is prominent in LAM
cells , as are cytoplasmic vesicles with an electron￾lucent content. Mitochondria are few. The cytoplasm
of epithelioid LAM cells frequently contains large
numbers of glycogen particles, which can be specifi￾cally stained at the ultrastructural level（Fig. 4 B）.
These particles account for the clear appearance of
large portions of the cytoplasm of these cells after
staining with hematoxylin-eosin . Epithelioid LAM
cells also contain cytoplasmic granules, 1―2 µm in di￾ameter, that are surrounded by limiting membranes,
and have an electron dense content characterized by
a lamellar or crystalline substructure25（Fig. 4 C）. On
the basis of electron microscopy after immunhisto￾chemical staining with HMB―45 antibody, these gran￾ules have been considered to correspond to stage I
and II premelanosomes（see below）28. Premelanosome￾like cytoplasmic granules also have been detected by
electron microscopy in the LAM cells in angiomyol￾ipomas29.
Two other transmission electron microscopic obser￾vations on LAM tissues are of interest. The first con￾cers the confirmation of the occurrence of hyperplasia
of type II pneumocytes, which show typical morpho￾logical features in the lesions of LAM23. These features
include apical microvilli, cytoplasmic bodies composed
of electron-dense lamellae arranged concentrically or
in parallel（lamellar bodies）, and cytoplasmic projec￾tions that extend from the basal surfaces. These pro￾jections penetrate through the basement membrane,
extend into the subjacent connective tissue, and make
direct contacts with cytoplasmic processes of connec￾tive tissue cells . These projections are morphologi￾cally similar to those found in type II pneumocytes in
normal as well as in fibrotic lungs23.
The second observation is related to the occurrence
of damage to extracellular connective tissue struc￾tures in LAM25,30. This damage consists of fragmenta￾tion of elastic fibers and the occurrence of collagen fi￾brils with a spiraling substructure . Neither of these
two changes is specific for LAM, and both have been
described in a variety of other pulmonary disorders.
Immunohistochemistry
Immunohistochemical studies have yielded impor￾tant information on LAM cells , particularly with re￾spect to identification by staining with HMB―45 anti￾body（Fig. 5 A）, cellular proliferation and apoptosis,
presence of growth factors（Figs. 5 B and 5 D）and re￾ceptors for steroid（sex）hormones（Fig. 5 C）, content
of muscle-specific proteins（Fig. 5 E）, and activity of
proteases（Figs. 5 A, 5 E, and 5 F）. The observations
summarized below were made on paraffin sections of
formalin-fixed tissues stained by the immunoperoxi￾dase method for single labeling and by the im￾munofluorescence method, followed by laser scanning
confocal fluorescence microscopy, for dual labeling.
Melanosomal components of LAM cells: reactiv￾ity with HMB―45 antibody: At the present time, im￾munostaining with HMB―45 antibody is considered to
be the most reliable method for the specific identifica￾tion of LAM cells19（Fig. 5 A）. However, staining with
this antibody is not detectable in all LAM cells, but is
localized mainly in cells of the epithelioid type. This
has been a consistent finding in a large number of pa￾318 J Nippon Med Sch 2000; 67（5）

tients with LAM, and the cells that give a positive re￾action with HMB―45 antibody are more mature than
those that are HMB―45―negative. HMB―45 is a mouse
monoclonal antibody that originally was found to re￾act with an extract from human malignant melanoma
cells, and was subsequently found to also react with a
variety of cells of melanocytic origin（see Matsumoto
et al.10 and Chu et al.28 for review）. The reactive sites
in these cells have been identified as stage I and II
melanosomes（premelanosomes）and nonmelanized
portions of stage III melanosomes28. Gp100, the protein
that reacts with HMB―45, and its alternatively spliced
form（pmel 17silver locus protein）are recognized by
three different monoclonal antibodies employed

widely for the diagnosis of melanomas: HMB ― 45,
HMB―50, and NKIbeteb. In melanocytic cells, gp100
is a part of the filamentous matrix of melanosomes31 .
This also appears to be the case in LAM cells . Im￾munoblots after electrophoresis of extracts from
LAM tissue have demonstrated a variety of HMB―45―
reactive protein bands, both smaller and larger than
100 kD. The smaller bands have been considered to
represent degradation products of gp10019.
In addition to LAM cells and melanocytic cells, only
clear cell tumors have been found to be reactive with
HMB―45 antibody5
. The histogenesis of these tumors
is uncertain and histochemical demonstration of large
amounts of cytoplasmic glycogen is very helpful for
their identification32,33.
The evidence reviewed above and electron micro￾scopic observations indicate, that an incomplete form
of melanogenesis occurs in LAM cells. Mature mela￾nosomes are not found in LAM cells , although they
are present in other types of smooth muscle cells ,

Melanogenesis is the process by which dark brown
cytoplasmic granules of melanin pigment are formed
through the progressive oxidation and polymerization
of aromatic aminoacids. The melanin pigment is pro￾duced in organelles known as melanosomes, which dif￾ferentiate into four stages. Melanin itself is not pre￾sent in stage I and II melanosomes（premelanosomes）
but begins to accumulate in stage III melanosomes .
Structural and enzymatic proteins of melanosomes
are synthesized sequentially according to genetic pro￾grams and are assembled within the membrane￾limited vacuoles of stage I melanosomes. Unoriented
filaments and lamellae also are formed within stage I
melanosomes.
Melanosomes contain several types of structural
and differentiation-specific proteins , including ty￾rosinase, tyrosinase-related proteins（i.e., TRP―1（gp―
75）and TRP― 2）, gp100, MART― 1melan A35 . Ty￾rosinase is a melanosomal membrane protein that is
required for the synthesis of melanin . This enzyme
catalyzes three distinct reactions within a single bio￾chemical pathway: 1 ） the dehydroxylation of a
monophenol（L-tyrosine）; 2）the dehydrogenation of
a catechol（L-DOPA）, and 3）the dehydrogenation of
a dihydroxyindol. DOPA serves as a cofactor for the
first and the third of these reactions , and as a sub￾strate for the second. The regulation of tyrosinase re￾quires an interaction between TRPs , lysosome￾associated membrane proteins, and other auxiliary en￾zymes36,37 . Tyrosinase is localized in a population of
coated vesicles in the transGolgi network , and in
premelanosomes38 . A positive reaction for tyrosinase
was obtained only in 1 of 15 angiomyolipomas39.
TRP― 1 is of particular interest because it is the
most abundant glycoprotein in human melanocytic
cells38, and is present in premelanosomes37. Melan A
MART―1 is a relatively small transmembrane protein
that is widely distributed in melanomas , but absent
from other tumors40. The importance of this antigen is
related to its presence in angiomyolipomas41 . How￾ever, the antibody against melan A is much less useful
than HMB―45 for the diagnosis of pulmonary LAM,
since only a few cases of LAM show scattered Melan
A-positive cells in LAM lesions（Valencia et al., unpub￾lished observation）. Fetsch et al.41 found a positive re￾action with both MART―1 and HMB―45 antibodies in
10 angiomyolipomas. Lesions of extrapulmonary LAM
from four patients were positive for HMB―45, but only
one showed reactivity with anti-MART―1. Diagnostic
experience with antibodies against other melanoso￾mal proteins has been extremely limited . The func￾tional and pathogenetic significance of melanosomal
components in LAM cells has not been established .
However, it is clear that melanogenesis in LAM cells
is incomplete , since mature melanosomes have not

been found in LAM cells.
Melanocortins: In an effort to understand the
mechanisms that lead to the formation of premelano￾somes in LAM cells, Valencia et al.42 performed immu￾nohistochemical studies of the distribution of melano￾cortins and their receptors in LAM tissue . Proteins
that regulate melanogenesis , include the melanotro￾pins（melanocyte-stimulating hormone or MSH and
adrenocorticotrophic hormone or ACTH） and five
types of melanocortin receptors（MCR）43. Valencia et
al. used antibodies for the detection of human ACTH,
MSH, MCR―1, MCR―2, MCR―3 and MCR―5, in lung tis￾sue from 18 women with LAM. Normal human adre￾nal and pituitary glands were used as positive con￾trols. The reactions for ACTH and MSH（Fig. 5 B）
were moderate to strong in the nuclear membranes
and moderate to weak in the cytoplasm and on the
cell surfaces（Fig. 5 E）. The cytoplasmic reactivity for
MSH was stronger than that for ACTH , especially
around perinuclear areas and cell surfaces of LAM
cells . Among the MCR antibodies tested , only that
against MCR―5 reacted with LAM cells. This reactiv￾ity was localized in the cytoplasm and cell surfaces .
Dual labeling showed that the HMB―45―positive cells
also were positive for either ACTH or MSH. Thus, the
melanocortins are potentially involved in melanogene￾sis in LAM cells and may have a role in their growth
and differentiation.
Factors related to cellular proliferation and
apoptosis: The cause of the proliferation of LAM
cells is unknown. Many factors are known to induce
proliferation of smooth muscle cells, but the possible
contributions of such factors to the pathogenesis of
LAM have not been systematically evaluated . The
numbers of LAM cells can be considered to reflect the
balance between cell proliferation and cell death（for
which apoptosis has to be regarded as critically im￾portant）. To evaluate these relationships, Usuki et al.44
employed immunohistochemical methods for the lo￾calization of Bcl―2 and MCL―1（inhibitors of apopto￾sis），Bax（a promoter of apoptosis）, c-myc（an apop￾tosis-related oncoprotein）, proliferating cell nuclear
antigen（PCNA, an indicator of mitotic activity）and
nick-end labeling（to identify apoptotic cells）in lung
tissues of 9 patients with LAM. In all patients, most
LAM cells were Bax-positive . The LAM cells were
positive for both Bcl―2 and estrogen receptors（ER）in
5 patients. Over 50％ of the Bcl―2―positive LAM cells
were also positive for ER. The reaction for c-Myc was
positive in all patients. The immunoreactivity for Bcl―
2 and MCL―1 was more intense in LAM cells than in
normal vascular and bronchial smooth muscle cells. In
six patients , > 50％ of the LAM cells were PCNA￾positive. Apoptotic LAM cells were infrequent . The
expression of Bcl―2 in LAM cells may be related to
hormonal regulation, resulting in a very low rate of
death of LAM cells by apoptosis . Additional studies
by Matsui et al.22, 24 demonstrated that PCNA reactiv￾ity is high in small , spindle-shaped LAM cells , but
very low in epithelioid LAM cells . Thus , it appears
that LAM cells in the lung have high rates of prolif￾eration and low rates of apoptosis . These features
have not yet been evaluated in the lesions of extrapul￾monary LAM or in angiomyolipomas.
Receptors for sex-steroid hormones: Several stu￾dies have demonstrated the presence of hormonal re￾ceptors in LAM tissue（see Matsui et al.45 for review）,
in keeping with the concept that this disorder is un￾der some type of hormonal regulation. Using dual la￾beling techniques（Fig. 5 C）, Matsui et al . demon￾strated the presence of estrogen receptors and pro￾gesterone receptors in LAM cells of the epitheliod
type. Some of these cells contained only one of the two
types of receptors, and approximately 50％ contained
both types22 . LAM cells have some resemblances to
uterine smooth muscle cells, which are known to be
highly responsive to estrogen and progesterone act￾ing through their specific receptors22. The relationship
of hormonal receptors to the clinical features and
course of LAM has been clarified only recently. Mat￾sui et al.22 performed immunohistochemical and confo￾cal microscopic studies of lung tissue from 10 women
with LAM to evaluate the distribution of ER and pro￾gesterone receptors（PR）in LAM cells. In 5 patients
from whom tissues were obtained before hormonal
treatment, PR and ER were localized mainly in the nu￾clei of large, epithelioid LAM cells. However, these re￾actions were essentially negative in similarly proc￾essed tissues from 5 patients studied after receiving
therapy with progesterone and tamoxifen. It appears
that PR and ER are selectively expressed in a sub￾population of LAM cells that are of the epithelioid
322 J Nippon Med Sch 2000; 67（5）

type, and that this expression maybe downregulated
by hormone therapy. We emphasize that a negative
immunohistochemical reaction for these receptors
may be due to their being present in concentrations
below the limit of detection by the staining method
used.
Insulin-like growth factors（IGFs）: The IGF sys￾tem comprises IGF―1, IGF―2, their receptors（IGF―1
R and IGF―2 R）and their binding proteins（IGFBP―1
to IGFBP―6）46. The IGF-BPs can either increase or de￾crease the binding of the IGFs to their cell surface re￾ceptors. Smooth muscle cells are important targets for
IGF―1 and IGF―247,48. These factors are also involved in
the growth and differentiation of smooth muscle cells
in uterine leiomyomas and in other smooth muscle cell
tumors of humans49. To evaluate the role of the IGF
system in the proliferation of LAM cells, Valencia et
al.50 used single and dual immunohistochemical proce￾dures for the detection of human IGF―1, IGF―2, IGF―1
R, and IGFBP―1 to IGFBP―6 in lung tissue from 20
wemen with LAM. The reactions for IGF― 1, IGF― 2
and IGF―1 R（Fig. 5 D）were positive in the cytoplasm
and on cell surfaces of spindle-shaped, and some epi￾thelioid LAM cells. The cytoplasmic reaction for IGF―
1 was less intense than those for IGF―2 and IGF―1 R.
Compared with LAM cells in the same tissue section,
bronchial and vascular smooth muscle cells were less
reactive for IGF―2 and IGF―1 R, equally reactive for
IGFBP―1 and IGFBP―2, and more reactive for IGF―1.
Reactivity for IGFBP ― 2, IGFBP ― 4, IGFBP ― 5 and
IGFBP― 6 was observed mainly in the cytoplasm of
spindle-shaped LAM cells located in the centers of the
LAM nodules. In contrast, IGFBP―5 was found mainly
in the cytoplasm of epithelioid LAM cells in peripheral
regions of the nodules. The reaction for IGFBP―2 was
more intense than that for the other IGFBPs. These
results are consistent with modulation of LAM cell
proliferation through autocrine and paracrine mecha￾nisms related to the IGF system.
Muscle proteins: In pulmonary LAM cells and nor￾mal smooth muscle cells from 14 patients, Tatsuguchi
et al.51 compared the expression of various proteins
known to be present in smooth muscle. Sections were
stained for α-smooth muscle actin（SMA; Fig. 5 E）,
desmin , vimentin , smooth muscle myosin heavy
chains I and II, nonmuscle myosin heavy chains-A and
-B , and HMB― 45 antibodies . Staining for α-SMA la￾beled all LAM cells. However, this labeling is not spe￾cific, because SMA is present in many other cells of
mesenchymal origin52－54 . Both desmin and smooth
muscle myosin heavy chains, which are markers for
mature smooth muscle cells55 , also were localized in
most LAM cells, but tended to be absent in the LAM
cells adjacent to epithelial cells overlying the LAM
nodules . Desmin is limited in distribution to muscle
cells27 . This is in contrast to vimentin , which is also
present in a variety of cells other than muscle27, and is
also found in LAM cells56 . In contrast , nonmuscle
myosin heavy chain-B, which is abundant in immature
or dedifferentiated smooth muscle cells（as well as in
many nonmuscle cells）57－60 , was preferentially local￾ized in subepithelial areas of LAM nodules. Nonmus￾cle myosin heavy chain-A was detected in only a few
LAM cells , but was abundant in endothelial cells
within LAM nodules. No significant relationship was
observed between the distribution of HMB ― 45-
reactive cells and those of the contractile proteins. In
paraffin sections of normal lung, α-SMA, desmin, and
smooth muscle myosin heavy chains were detected in
all smooth muscle cells; nonmuscle myosin heavy
chain A and B were present in vascular smooth mus￾cle but not in airway smooth muscle. A few smooth
muscle cells in lymphatics were positive for nonmus￾cle myosin heavy chain B. Under the conditions used
in the study, reactivity for α-actinin could not be dem￾onstrated in any cells. Nevertheless , peripherally lo￾cated dense bodies that correspond to accumulations
of α-actinin are present in LAM cells in tissue sections
as well as in cultures. This study shows: 1）that LAM
cells express several types of contractile proteins in
addition to α-SMA, thus supporting the concept that
they are smooth muscle cells and 2）that their reactiv￾ity for these proteins is heterogeneous , perhaps re￾flecting different degrees of differentiation of the
LAM cells.
Proteases: It has become clear that the pulmonary
cystic lesions in LAM are the result of proteolytic ac￾tivity directed against extracellular components of
the connective tissue of the lung（Fig. 5 F）. In this re￾spect, consideration has to be given to the possibility
that the matrix metalloproteinases（MMPs）play an
important role in this destruction24. The MMPs, their
J Nippon Med Sch 2000; 67（5） 323

activating enzymes（membrane-type MMPs or MT￾MMPs）and their specific tissue inhibitors（TIMPs）are
known to regulate the synthesis and the lysis of con￾nective tissues in normal and pathological states24 .
Previous studies have demonstrated the importance
of this system in the pathogenesis of diffuse alveloar
damage , idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis , and Langer￾hans' cell granulomatosis, and in the formation of me￾tastases of carcinomas of the lung61 . To evaluate the
role of MMPs and their specific TIMPs in the struc￾tural damage and cystic lesions of pulmonary LAM,
Hayashi et al.61 made immunohistochemical studies of
the localization of MMP―1, MMP―2, MMP―3, MMP―9,
TIMP― 1, TIMP― 2, HMB― 45, and type IV collagens
（Fig. 5 F）in sections of lung biopsy specimens from
4 patients with this disorder . They demonstrated
greater immunoreactivity in LAM cells than in nor￾mal bronchiolar and vascular smooth muscle cells, for
MMP―2 and, to a lesser extent, MMP―9 and MMP―1.
MMP―2 was also localized in some elastic fibers and in
the basement membranes of LAM cells and overlying
epithelial cells. The basement membranes in both of
these sites often showed colocalization of MMP―2 and
type IV collagen . Some epithelial basement mem￾branes showing this colocalization were disrupted .
These changes were not accompanied by increased
immunoreactivity for TIMPs . Taken together with
previous observations showing structural damage to
elastic fibers and collagen25, 62, and with the absence of
demonstrable neutrophil or pancreatic types of
elastase , these findings suggest that MMP ― 2 and
MMP―9（both of which can degrade elastin as well as
collagens）are responsible for the cyst formation in
LAM.
Most of the MMPs are secreted in the form of bio￾logically inactive proenzymes , which must undergo
proteolytic cleavage in order to become activated63 .
Many mechanisms can result in this activation; how￾ever, the most important of these involves proteolysis
by MT-MMPs. To evaluate the role of potential acti￾vating enzymes , immunohistochemical and confocal
microscopic techniques were used to localize α-SMA,
HMB―45, PCNA, MMP―2, MT―1―MMP, MT―2―MMP,
and MT―3―MMP in lung tissue from 10 women with
LAM24 . Tissues samples were obtained from 5 un￾treated patients and 5 who had been treated with pro￾gesterone andor tamoxifen. Staining for α-SMA and
MMP―2 was present in all of the LAM cells in both
groups. The percentages of PCNA-, MMP―2―, or MT―
1―MMP-positive LAM cells were much higher in the
untreated group that in the treated group , whereas
the percentages of HMB―45―reactive LAM cells were
similar in the two groups. The reactions for MT―1―
MMP（Figs. 5 A and 5 E）and PCNA were preferen￾tially localized in small, spindle-shaped LAM cells. As
in previous studies , the reaction for HMB ― 45 was
found in large , epithelioid LAM cells . Many of the
PCNA-positive cells were also positive for MT ― 1 ―
MMP. Staining for MT―2―MMP and MT―3―MMP was
negative. This study demonstrates that MT―1―MMP
is most abundant in the LAM cells that show evidence
of a high rate of proliferation and lack steroid hor￾mone receptors. It is possible that such cells are less
responsive to hormonal therapy than are the more
mature epithelioid LAM cells; however , it appears
that, under the conditions employed for immunohisto￾chemical staining, this enzyme is not detected in LAM
tissue from patients who have undergone prolonged
hormonal thepapy. This finding can be interpreted as
indicative of downregulation due to a therapeutic re￾sponse.
Isolation and culture of HMB―45―Positive
LAM cells
Research on LAM cells has been hampered by the
lack of a tissue culture model in which biochemical
and pharmacological studies can be made. Yu et al.65
recently succeeded in isolating LAM cells（Figs. 6 and
7）from lung tissue of patients undergoing pulmonary
transplantation for the treatment of LAM. Samples of
the excised lungs were collected under sterile condi￾tions, placed in RPMI―1640 medium at 4℃. The me￾dium was then replaced by M―199 medium containing
antibiotics and 10％ fetal bovine serum（FBS）. Sam￾ples of tissue were cut into 1 mm cubes, washed, and
incubated at 37℃. Two to three weeks were required
for growth of smooth muscle cells from the edges of
the explanted tissue; these cells were HMB―45―posi￾tive, with histochemical（Figs. 6 B to 6 D）and ultra￾structural（Fig. 7）characteristics similar to those of
LAM cells in situ. As an alternative method that gave
324 J Nippon Med Sch 2000; 67（5）

similar results , the 1 mm cubes of tissue were
trypsinized. The cells were then cultured in M― 199
with 10％ FBS in 100 mm dishes. Growth of LAM cells
from these preparations was evident only after two
weeks of culture . The reaction with HMB ― 45 re￾mained positive in these cells through eight passages,
but was less intense than that of the LAM cells in
lung . It is expected that studies using this in vitro
model will produce important new information on the
biochemistry and pharmacology of LAM cells.
Treatment
The most widely used form of treatment of LAM
utilizes progesterone10,22. The results of this treatment
have been variable. This therapy can result only in
slowing down, but not in reversal or cessation, of the
disease process; however, it is associated with signifi￾cant side effects 10,11. Therapy with tamoxifen alone is
uncommonly employed for LAM because the partial
agonist effect of this agent on ER and the association
of its use with possible exacerbation of the disease65 .
Pleurodesis can be used to minimize the risk of recur￾rent pneumothorax, but can cause difficult technical
problems for subsequent pulmonary transplantation10.
The latter therapy is usually performed only on pa￾tients who have very advanced stages of the disease66.
At least three patients developed recurrent LAM in
the allografted lung within two years after unilateral
pulmonary transplantation67 . In all three cases , the

transplanted lung was from a male donor. In one pa￾tient , the LAM cells in the transplanted lung were
studied using chromosomal markers and were found
to be of donor（male）origin68. The frequency of occur￾rence of LAM in transplanted lungs needs to be evalu￾ated in a large series of patients.
Prognosis
Early reports of LAM indicated a poor survival ,
with most patients dying within 10 years after the in￾itial diagnosis（see Matsui et al.69 for review）. Recent
reports suggest a better prognosis. The relationships
between the histologic patterns and the survival of
the patients with LAM were analyzed by Kitaichi et
al.8
, who classified this disorder into two types: a pre￾dominantly cystic , and a predominantly muscular
type. Their study showed that patients with the cys￾tic type had a poorer prognosis. Using a grading sys￾tem based on the overall histologic abnormalities due
to cystic lesions and muscle proliferation, these inves￾tigators concluded that increased amounts of abnor￾mal areas showed a negative correlation with survival
of the patients from 2 to 5 years after open lung bi￾opsy. The basic concept of the histologic grading sys￾tem of LAM , as outlined by Matsui et al .69 , is quite
similar to that proposed by Kitaichi et al.8 in that the
two major histologic features, i.e., the extent of cystic
lesions and of muscle proliferation, form the basis of
both grading systems. We concluded that these two
major histologic findings were too variable to serve as
the basis for classification into nodular and cystic
types. Like Kitaichi et al.8
, Matsui et al.69 found that the
percentage of cystic lesions by itself was a predictor
of survival , while the extent of infiltration by LAM
cells was not. However, a combined rating of the two
types of lesions provided a grading system that corre￾lated much more closely with survival of the patients
than did grading by cystic lesions alone69.
Beasley et al .70 studied the correlations between
clinical and follow-up data and histopathologic find￾ings in 105 women with pulmonary LAM. The actuar￾ial survival（to pulmonary transplantation or death）of
the patients from the time of lung biopsy was 85.1％
and 71.0％ after 5 and 10 years, respectively. The his￾tologic severity of LAM, graded as a LAM histologic
score （ LHS ）, was determined on the basis of
semiquantitative estimation of the percentage of tis￾sue involvement by the two major features of LAM,
i. e., the cystic lesions and the infiltration by LAM cells
in each case: LHS―1, <25％, LHS―2, 25―50％ and LHS―
3, >50％ . Analysis by the Kaplan-Meier method re￾vealed significant differences in survival for patients
with LHS 1, 2, and 3（p=0.0026）. The five and 10 year
survivals were: 100％ and 100％ for LHS―1, 89.9％ and
74.6％ for LHS―2 and 59.1％ and 47.3％ for LHS―3. In￾creased degrees of accumulation of hemosiderin-laden
macrophages also were associated with higher LHS
scores（p=0.029）and a worse prognosis（p=0.0012）.
Thus, this study suggests that the LHS provides a ba￾sis for determining the prognosis of LAM.
In a very recent study, we examined over 20 his￾tologic features in lung specimens from 174 women
（mean age±SD, 38.0±8.5 years）with LAM. The LHS
correlated well with many histologic variables, includ￾ing the maximal size of the cysts, a random or pre￾dominantly subpleuralseptal distribution of the LAM
infiltrates, infiltration of the walls of blood vessels by
LAM cells , degree of accumulation of hemosiderin￾laden macrophages, hemorrhage, hyperplasia of type
II pneumocytes and pleural fibrosis . However , the
LHS did not correlate with the age of the patients at
the time of diagnosis or with reactive pleuritis and for￾mation of bullae. A predominant distribution of lesions
in subpleuralseptal areas was found in patients with
a lower LHS. This may explain why many patients de￾veloped pneumothorax at the onset of the disease .

Thus, this study confirms the usefulness of the LHS
for the evaluation of the prognosis of LAM.
In conclusion, the basic abnormalities in LAM are
related to excessive proliferation of an abnormal type
of smooth muscle cells（LAM cells）and to the destruc￾tion of pulmonary connective tissue by proteolytic en￾zymes derived from these cells. The nature（neoplas￾tic vs. non-neoplastic）of this proliferation remains un￾clear. Only a sub-population of LAM cells（epithelioid
cells）gives a positive reaction with HMB―45 antibody,
which is the most specific marker for diagnosing the
disorder. LAM cells are under some degree of control
by endocrine factors , as shown by their content of
steroid（sex）hormone receptors. The isolation and cul￾ture of LAM cells has provided a new method for the
in vitro study of this disease.
