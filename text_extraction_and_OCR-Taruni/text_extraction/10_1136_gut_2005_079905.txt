Background: Host genetic factors may significantly influence the ability to clear hepatitis C virus (HCV)
following infection. HCV is associated with very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) and low density
lipoproteins (LDL) in the host’s circulation. Apolipoprotein E (APOE) is found in VLDL and binds to potential
receptors involved in HCV entry into cells, the LDL receptor, and the scavenger receptor protein SR-B1. The
APOE gene is polymorphic with three alleles coding for three isoforms: Apo-e2, Apo-e3, and Apo-e4. The
aim of this study was to assess if these functional polymorphisms determine disease outcome in HCV
infected individuals.
Methods: The APOE genotype was determined in 420 Northern European patients with evidence of
exposure to HCV. Genotype and allele distribution were compared with those of 288 healthy controls and
progression of liver disease and viral clearance were analysed according to APOE allele status.
Results: The APOE*E2 and APOE*E4 alleles were both associated with a reduced likelihood of chronic
infection (odds ratio (OR) 0.39 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.211–0.728), p = 0.003; and OR 0.6 (95%
CI 0.38–0.96), p = 0.032) and there was a notable absence of the E2E2 genotype in the HCV antibody
positive group compared with the control population (p = 0.0067). Overall the genotypes carrying the E2
allele (E2,E3 and E2,E4) were associated with the equivalent of a 3–5-fold reduction in the risk of chronic
HCV infection (genotype relative risk 0.36 and 0.20, respectively).
Conclusion: This study indicates that functional APOE gene polymorphisms may be a determinant of
outcome in HCV infection. We hypothesise that the E2 allele may protect against viral persistence via
defective binding of HCV lipoviral particles to the cellular receptors involved in entry of these infectious
particles.
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a major global health
problem, infecting more than 170 million people
worldwide.1 Some newly infected patients recover
spontaneously but the majority progress to chronic infection
so that HCV infection is now the leading cause of cirrhosis,
hepatocellular cancer, and liver transplantation in the
Western world.2
Persisting strong CD8+ T cell responses are observed in the
majority with resolved HCV infection3 but the role of host
factors in viral clearance and disease progression remains
unclear. There is some evidence that host genetic factors are
implicated in the outcome following HCV infection.4 Specific
HLA haplotypes have been associated with a significantly
increased likelihood of viral clearance, including the HLA￾DRB1*1101-DQB1*0301, DRB1*1104-DQB1*0301, and
DRB1*0401-DQB1*0301 haplotypes.4–7 In addition, recent data
suggest that inherited variation in the killer inhibitory
receptor genes may play a significant role in determining
the host response to HCV infection.8
Other host factors associated with disease progression in
chronic HCV include male sex, age at infection, excessive
alcohol use, total cholesterol level, and insulin resistance.9 In
addition, there is now considerable accumulating evidence to
suggest a relationship between hepatitis C virus and lipid
metabolism.10 During the early stages of acute HCV infection
in chimpanzees, host genes involved in lipid metabolism are
differentially regulated.11 In patients with chronic HCV,
serum cholesterol is significantly lower than in appropriately
matched controls,12 particularly in HCV genotype 3 infec￾tion,13 14 and this metabolic effect is fully reversible after
successful HCV eradication.15 The association of HCV infection
with hypocholesterolaemia has been confirmed in human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected patients16 and in
patients with porphyria cutanea tarda.17 In many studies the
hypocholesterolaemia has been associated with a decrease in
apolipoprotein B (ApoB) in comparison with healthy con￾trols12 17 18 and ApoB levels negatively correlate with hepatic
steatosis and viral load.18 Furthermore, HCV viral load can be
reduced by heparin induced extracorporeal lipoprotein fibrino￾gen precipitation apheresis, which is an established and
approved therapy for hypercholesterolaemia.19
HCV RNA containing particles are consistently found in the
low density fractions of serum and this fraction has been
shown to be highly infectious.20 Further characterisation of
these low density HCV RNA containing particles (lipoviral
particles (LVP)) has shown that they efficiently bind and
enter hepatocyte cell lines, upregulation of the low density
lipoprotein receptor (LDLr) increases their internalisation,
and binding of HCV-LVP can be blocked by anti-ApoB and
anti-apolipoprotein E (ApoE).21 22 This is consistent with
other studies showing that endocytosis of HCV can be
mediated by LDLr.23 24 LDLr, a candidate receptor for HCV,
normally transports two different classes of cholesterol
containing lipoprotein particles into cells: LDL, which
contains a single copy of ApoB-100, and very low density
lipoprotein (VLDL), which contains multiple copies of ApoE.

Recent studies with retrovirus/HCV pseudovirus particles25
suggest that attachment to hepatocytes is via the scavenger
receptor protein, SR-B1, with entry into the cell via a co￾receptor CD-81 dependent pathway.26 27 SR-B1, which is
expressed primarily in the liver, is a key component in the
reverse cholesterol transport pathway, and recognises a broad
variety of lipoprotein ligands, including high density lipo￾protein, LDL, VLDL, and oxidised LDL.28–30
ApoE, a ligand for both LDLr and SR-B1, is a polymorphic
protein arising from three alleles at a single gene locus. The
three major isoforms, Apo-e2, Apo-e3, and Apo-e4, differ
from one another by single amino acid substitutions, a
change which has profound functional consequences at both
the cellular and molecular levels. Apo-e3 seems to be the
wild-type isoform with normal function, while Apo-e2 binds
poorly to LDLr, and Apo-e4 induces downregulation of
LDLr.31
A previous study of APOE gene polymorphisms in HCV
infection suggested decreased severity of liver disease in
patients with the E4 allele.32 As ApoE is a ligand for the HCV
receptor candidates LDLr and SR-B1 and in view of the
considerable evidence suggesting that cholesterol and fatty
acid pathways may play a role in HCV replication and
infection, the aim of this study was to determine whether the
common functional polymorphisms of the APOE gene can
influence the clinical outcome of HCV infection.
PATIENTS AND METHODS
Patients
Whole blood (5 ml) was obtained from 420 Caucasian HCV
antibody positive patients recruited from two centres, the
joint hepatitis clinic of Freeman Hospital, Newcastle upon
Tyne, UK (n = 241) and St James’s Hospital, Dublin, Ireland
(n = 179).33 Whole blood (5 ml) was also collected from 288
healthy adult volunteers (controls) to assess the ApoE
genotype distribution in the healthy population.34
HCV viral RNA was tested in all HCV antibody positive
patients using the Amplicor reverse transcriptase polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) assay (Roche, Lewes, East Sussex, UK).
A total of 312 patients were HCV RNA positive on at least two
occasions, indicating persistent or chronic infection, whereas
108 patients were HCV RNA negative on at least two
occasions, indicating spontaneously resolved infection.
Liver biopsies were available for 209 patients with evidence
of chronic infection. Each biopsy was scored by a single
observer, Professor AD Burt, using the Ishak scoring system.35
Biopsies were graded for necroinflammation on a scale of 0–
16 and fibrosis on a scale of 0–6 (fibrosis stage 5 or 6
indicated severe disease, 2–4 moderate disease, and 0 or 1
mild disease). An estimate of the rate of fibrosis was made on
178 of these patients. Date of infection was either estimated
in intravenous drug users (IVDU) as the date when IVDU
started, or was calculated as the date of exposure to infected
blood or the date of a one off/short period of IVDU. The Ishak
stage of fibrosis was divided by the time in years from the
date of infection to first biopsy to give a calculation of the rate
of fibrosis. Rapid progression was identified as patients
progressing to cirrhosis within 20 years (a rate of fibrosis
.0.25/year). In this subgroup of patients, data on alcohol
use, age at biopsy, sex, and mode of infection were also
collected; all data and results were entered into a Microsoft
Access database.
Apolipoprotein E genotyping
Genomic DNA was isolated from 2 ml of whole blood using
QIAamp midi kits (Qiagen Ltd, Crawley, UK). A 227 bp
product of the APOE gene was amplified using a pair of
sequence specific primers in a standard PCR reaction.36
Briefly, approximately 100 ng of DNA were amplified in a
50 ml reaction mix containing 2.5 ml of 100% DMSO, 1.5 mM
MgCl2, 10 mM Tris-HCl, 50 mM KCl, 0.5 mM of each primer,
200 mM of each nucleotide, and 2.5 U of Taq polymerase
(Abgene, Epsom, Surrey, UK). Amplification conditions were
as follows: two minutes at 95˚C and then 40 cycles of two
minutes at 95˚C, two minutes at 65˚C, and two minutes at
72˚C, with a final extension for five minutes at 72˚C. All PCR
batches included a water (DNA free) negative control and
samples of known genotype. All genotypes were assigned by
two independent investigators and any ambiguous genotypes
were repeated. The 227 bp product was subaliquoted into
duplicate reaction tubes and subjected to digestion with two
different restriction endonucleases AflIII and HaeI; digestions
were performed with 25 U of each enzyme at room
temperature for a minimum of three hours. The resulting
restriction fragments were separated on 3% agarose gels and
the bands were visualised using ethidium bromide staining
on a UV transilluminator and documented on an
AlphaImager 2200 Documentation and Analysis System
(AlphaInnotech Corp., USA). AflIII digests the PCR ampli￾cons of the APOE*2 and E3 alleles only creating bands of
117 bp and 50 bp (amplicons of E4 do not digest, leaving the
227 bp amplicon intact). HaeII digests the E3 and E4
amplicons only resulting in bands of 195 bp and 32 bp
(amplicons of the E2 allele are not digested, leaving an intact
227 bp amplicon). Thus by comparing the restriction patterns
for the two digests on every sample, we can assign composite
genotypes for E2,E2; E2,E3; E3,E3; E2,E4; E3,E4; and E4,E4.
Statistical analysis
Genotype and allele distribution were compared using Stata.
As the E3 allele is associated with normal APOE activity, the
risk for the common (wild-type) genotype E3,E3 was fixed
(at 1) and the risk for all other genotypes are reported relative
to this. In the whole HCV antibody positive cohort (n = 420)
the following comparisons of allele and genotype distribution
were made:
N control group (n = 288) versus HCV exposed (HCV anti￾body positive) population;
N chronic HCV infection (n = 312) versus spontaneously
resolved (cleared) infection (n = 108).
In the subgroup with chronic HCV infection whose liver
biopsies were scored by a single observer, the following
comparisons of allele and genotype distribution were made:
N severe liver disease versus mild/moderate chronic hepatitis
(n = 209);
N slow fibrosis progression versus rapid fibrosis progression
(n = 178).
Risk is reported as genotype relative risk (GRR) for
comparison of genotype distribution, and odds ratio (OR)
for comparison of allele distribution with 95% confidence
intervals (CI). Multivariate binary logistic regression was
used to assess independent variables, including sex, alcohol
usage, and age of infection in relation to APOE status in HCV
antibody positive patients. All additional computations were
performed using SPSS-10 for windows.
RESULTS
Comparing all patients versus healthy controls, there was a
significantly lower frequency of the E2,E2 genotype in the
diseased population (x2 = 7.34, p = 0.0067) (table 1).
Comparison of the APOE genotypes in the two clinical
subgroups (table 2) of patients with spontaneously resolved
infection (HCV RNA negative cleared infection, n = 108)
versus chronic infection (HCV RNA positive chronic infection,
n = 312) demonstrated that the genotypes E2,E3 and E2,E4

were mostly strongly associated with clearance of HCV
(p = 0.005, GRR E2,E3 0.36 (95% CI 0.18–0.73); and
p = 0.02, GRR E2,E4 0.2 (95% CI 0.52–0.78), respectively).
In addition, while there was a significant effect of the E3,E4
genotype (p = 0.022, GRR 0.55 (95% CI 0.33–0.92)) the E4,E4
genotype was not significant (p = 0.811) due to the low
numbers in the comparator subgroups. Comparing allele
distribution, the lowest risk of chronic infection was
associated with the E2 allele (OR 0.39 (95% C.I. 0.21–0.73))
compared with the E4 allele (OR 0.59 (95% CI 0.38–0.96)).
APOE*2 was the only independent predictor of viral
clearance in a multivariate logistic regression model. No
other significant associations were found comparing patients
and controls, or comparing those with chronic versus those
with resolved HCV infection. In addition, there was no
significant association between APOE genotype or APOE
alleles and the clinical phenotypes defined by severe
inflammation (Ishak grade .8, n = 37), severe fibrosis
(Ishak stages 5 and 6, n = 45), or fast fibrosis (rate of fibrosis
>0.25/year, n = 60).
DISCUSSION
ApoE plays an important role in the transport of cholesterol
and other lipids among cells of various tissues. Three major
isoforms, encoded by three common alleles at the APOE
locus, have different binding affinities for the Apo E
receptors. The E2 allele is associated with defective binding
to LDLr and the E4 allele with downregulation of LDLr
compared with E3.31 In this study, APOE*2 and APOE*4 alleles
were both associated with an increased likelihood of viral
clearance and, interestingly, there were no HCV antibody
positive patients with the APOE E2,E2 genotype, although
this is relatively rare in healthy controls (0.5–2%).37 A
previous investigation of the influence of APOE polymorph￾ism and outcome of HCV infection32 suggested that the
APOE*4 allele protected against severe liver disease. Our
results did not confirm this finding but suggested that this
allele may also be associated with a reduced risk of viral
persistence. However, it is probable that neither this nor the
earlier study was adequately powered to look at subtle effects
of the Apo-e4 isoform on disease progression. This latter
comment is especially true when other factors associated
with disease progression, which may vary between cohorts,
are considered.9 Another small study has suggested that
heterozygosity for the APOE*4 allele might be associated with
better histological outcome in recurrent HCV infection in the
liver transplantation setting38 but this situation is compli￾cated by possible differences in donor/recipient APOE alleles.
It is also of interest that chronic HCV is associated with
cognitive dysfunction and CNS infection39 and a recent study
has demonstrated an association between APOE*4 and
neuropsychiatric symptoms during interferon alpha treat￾ment for chronic HCV.40
The association found between the E2 allele and viral
clearance is intriguing as this allele binds poorly to LDLr.31 It
is plausible that such defective binding could result in poor
uptake of HCV lipoviral particles into hepatocyte with a
resultant decrease in replication of the virus, thus altering the
balance between virus replication and the immune response
and favouring clearance of the virus before chronic infection
can be established. This is supported by the lack of E2,E2
genotype among patients who are HCV antibody positive,
suggesting that the E2,E2 genotype (0.5–2% of healthy
controls37) may confer relative resistance to establishing
HCV infection in exposed individuals. This could be some￾what analogous to the role played by the chemokine receptor￾5 delta 32 mutation, which leads to defective uptake of the
HIV virion and therefore resistance to HIV/acquired immu￾nodeficiency syndrome.41 In the latter case, homozygotes for
the delta 32 mutation exhibit a strong, although incomplete,
resistance to HIV infection whereas heterozygotes display
delayed progression to acquired immunodeficiency syn￾drome. Conversely, the results reported here may indicate
an association between the APOE*3 allele and persistence of
the hepatitis C virus. This would fit a model whereby APOE*3
binds to receptors with high affinity and is associated with
normal serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels.
In conclusion, this study suggests that common genetic
variations at the APOE locus influence the outcome of HCV
infection, with the APO*E2 and APO*E4 alleles favouring viral
clearance. We hypothesise that ApoE2, which binds poorly
with its receptors, may be associated with resistance to HCV
infection via defective uptake of HCV lipoviral particles by the
candidate receptors LDLr and SR-B1. Further investigations
are needed, especially in individuals who are likely to have
been repeatedly exposed to HCV but remain anti-HCV
antibody negative.42 Although the inability to replicate the
results of case control studies has led to scepticism about
their value,43 our findings are both biologically plausible and
statistically significant. If our findings are confirmed in a
validation study, the function of apolipoprotein E in
assembly, processing, and removal of plasma lipoproteins
