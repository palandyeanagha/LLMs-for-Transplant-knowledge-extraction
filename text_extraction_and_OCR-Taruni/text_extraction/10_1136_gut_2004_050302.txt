Background: Insulin resistance is a frequent feature of chronic hepatitis C. Whether insulin resistance could
be the cause or consequence of steatosis and fibrosis is unknown. The ability of HCV genotype 3 to
promote steatosis by itself provides an unique opportunity to answer this question.
Aims: The aim of the present study was to assess the relationships between insulin resistance, steatosis, and
fibrosis according to genotype in 141 non-diabetic patients with biopsy proven non-cirrhotic chronic
hepatitis C.
Methods: All patients had fasting serum glycaemia and insulinaemia measurements. Insulin resistance was
evaluated using the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA IR) method. Liver steatosis was determined
according to hepatitis C virus genotype (1 or 3). Logistic regression and multivariate regression analysis
were used to identify variables independently associated with insulin resistance, fatty liver, and fibrosis.
Results: Although steatosis and fibrosis were more severe in genotype 3 patients, median HOMA IR was
significantly higher in patients with genotype 1 related steatosis than in those with genotype 3 related
steatosis (2.1 v 1; p = 0.001). Independent risk factors for steatosis were insulin resistance in genotype 1
patients (p = 0.001) and viral load in genotype 3 patients (p = 0.003). Among genotype 1 patients,
independent parameters associated with insulin resistance were age (p = 0.04) and steatosis (p = 0.004).
Steatosis was associated with more severe fibrosis whatever the genotype (p = 0.002). Among genotype 1
patients, although there was a significant relationship between circulating insulin level and fibrosis stage
(p = 0.006), only steatosis and inflammatory score were independently associated with fibrosis.
Conclusion: This study shows that insulin resistance is the cause rather than the consequence of steatosis
and fibrosis in genotype 1 patients and that increased circulating insulin is a risk factor for fibrosis through
insulin resistance induced steatosis.
L
iver steatosis is common in chronic hepatitis C virus
infection (HCV).1–3 Evidence supporting a detrimental role
for steatosis in liver fibrosis progression in chronic
hepatitis C has been provided recently. Several studies have
shown that either fat accumulation in the liver or worsening
are strong and independent predictors of the severity and
progression of fibrosis in chronic hepatitis C infection,
irrespective of the viral genotype involved.4–10 Two main
mechanisms have been proposed to account for the high
prevalence of steatosis in chronic hepatitis C. Firstly, in
patients infected with genotype 3, the degree of steatosis is
correlated with the level of viral load,4 11 suggesting that HCV
could alter fatty acid metabolism and/or export in hepato￾cytes.12 13 Secondly, type 2 diabetes and more generally
insulin resistance is highly frequent in chronic HCV infection,
as established by several recent epidemiological studies.14–21
Whether or not insulin resistance is a player in the
development of the histological lesions of chronic hepatitis
C—as in alcoholic or non-alcoholic steatohepatitis—or simply
the consequence of viral infection and liver injury is debated.
Recently, Shintani et al have shown that insulin resistance
preceded the occurrence of steatosis in transgenic mice
expressing HCV core protein, suggesting that insulin resis￾tance is not a consequence of hepatic steatosis in these mice.22
This issue is of obvious practical importance because
appropriate treatment should be based on the pathophysio￾logical process involved in the disease. In the present study
we addressed the following questions: is insulin resistance
the cause or the consequence of steatosis and fibrosis in
chronic hepatitis C? In other words, is insulin resistance, at
least in part, responsible for the occurrence and worsening of
steatosis and fibrosis? What are the determinants of insulin
resistance in chronic hepatitis C? The unique ability of HCV
genotype 3 to promote by itself steatosis provides the
opportunity to clarify and unravel the complex relationships
between insulin resistance, steatosis, and fibrosis.
PATIENTS AND METHODS
Study population
Between June 2001 and May 2002, 192 consecutive patients
with chronic hepatitis C underwent liver biopsy in our liver
unit. All subjects had positive HCV viraemia, as detected by
reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)
(Amplicor; Roche Diagnostic Systems, Branchburg, New
Jersey, USA) and increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT)
activity. Patients were retrospectively screened according to
the following criteria: (1) the presence of non-cirrhotic
chronic hepatitis on liver biopsy specimens greater than
10 mm; (2) no previous antiviral treatment; (3) no personal
history of diabetes or a fasting serum glucose ,7 mmol/l; (4)
alcohol intake ,20 g/day; (5) no regular use of drugs known
to induce steatosis (for example, corticosteroids, valproic
acid, amiodarone, perhexiline maleate, tamoxifen); (6)
absence of serum hepatitis B surface antigen; (7) absence
of co-existing chronic liver disease, such as autoimmune
hepatitis, primary biliary cirrhosis, sclerosing cholangitis,
haemochromatosis, Wilson’s disease, or a1 antitrypsin
deficiency; and (8) absence of human immunodeficiency
virus antibodies. A total of 141 patients met these criteria.

Excluded patients had one or more exclusion criteria:
cirrhosis in 17, alcohol intake .20 g/day in 34, personal
history of diabetes in six, fasting serum glucose .7 mmol/l in
16, previous antiviral treatment in five, and inadequate
biopsy in 31.
Clinical parameters
The following data were recorded at the time of liver biopsy:
age, sex, duration of HCV infection, estimated as the time
elapsed since the date of contamination in patients with
known risk factors (for example, date of transfusion or
beginning of intravenous drug use) and liver biopsy, body
mass index (BMI), and mean daily alcohol intake between
the date of contamination and diagnosis of HCV infection.
BMI was calculated as body weight (kg) divided by squared
height in metres (kg/m2
). Patients were interviewed using a
standard questionnaire for their alcohol intake in the past
five years.23
Methods
Laboratory determinations
After an overnight fast of 10 hours, venous blood samples
were drawn to determine serum levels of the following
parameters: alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate
aminotransferase, plasma glucose concentration, insulin,
and C peptide. All studies were performed before 9am.
Plasma glucose concentration was measured by a glucose
oxidase method on a vitros 750 analyser (Johnson and
Johnson Clinical Diagnostics, Rochester, New York, USA).
Serum insulin was measured by monoclonal immunoradio￾metric assay (CIS Bio International, Gif sur Yvette, France).
Serum C peptide was estimated by a immunoradiometric
assay (CIS Bio International). The index of insulin resistance
was calculated on the basis of fasting values for glycaemia
and insulinaemia, according to the homeostasis model
assessment (HOMA) method.24 The formula for the HOMA
model is as follows:
insulin resistance (HOMA IR) = fasting insulinaemia (mU/
ml) 6fasting glycaemia (mmol/l)/22.5.
Insulin resistance, determined by this method, correlates
closely with more complex techniques, such as the eugly￾caemic clamp method, in both diabetic and non-diabetic
subjects.25 26 Because serum insulin levels may be increased
secondary to advanced liver fibrosis, insulin secretion was
compared in patients with and without fibrosis using the
serum C peptide/insulin ratio. C peptide and insulin are
secreted in equimolar amounts, and serum C peptide is not
significantly cleared by the liver.27
Virological methods
All subjects were reactive for anti-HCV antibodies using a
third generation enzyme immunoassay EIA (Ortho HCV 3.0
Elisa (Ortho Diagnostic Systems, Raritan, New Jersey, USA)
or Monolisa anti-HCV (Sanofi Diagnostics Pasteur, Marnes￾la-Coquette, France)). All patients were tested for HCV RNA
by RT-PCR (Amplicor HCV; Roche Diagnostic Systems). HCV
RNA was quantified by Quantiplex HCV RNA 2.0 Assay
(Chiron Diagnostics, Emeryville, California, USA). HCV
genotypes were determined using the Inno-Lipa II HCV
(Innogenetics, Ghent, Belgium).
Histological evaluation
Paraffin embedded biopsies were analysed by a single
pathologist unaware of the clinical and biological data,
except for the presence of chronic hepatitis C. This analysis
was performed following haematoxylin-phloxin-safran,
Perls, and picrosirius red staining, using the METAVIR group
items. Steatosis was graded according to the percentage of
hepatocytes containing cytoplasmic vacuoles. Only macro￾vesicular steatosis was taken into account. Steatosis was
classified as significant when more than 10% of hepatocytes
were affected. Hepatitis was finally graded and staged using
the METAVIR scoring system.28 29 Hepatic iron concentration
was determined according to the Barry and Sherlock
method.30
Each liver biopsy specimen was analysed twice by the same
pathologist in a blinded manner, with good intraobserver
concordance.
Statistical analysis
Qualitative values are expressed as percentages and were
compared using Fisher’s exact test. Quantitative values are
expressed as medians (range) and were compared using the
Mann-Whitney or Kruskal-Wallis test, when more than two
classes, or Spearman’s correlation test. For statistical analy￾sis, patients infected with genotypes other than 3 were

collected into a single group termed ‘‘genotype 1 patients’’.
Risk factors for insulin resistance were assessed in genotype 1
patients by correlating HOMA IR with the following
parameters: age at liver biopsy, sex ratio, disease duration,
BMI, mean daily alcohol intake, ALT activity, viral load,
activity score, fibrosis score, percentage of steatosis, and
intrahepatic iron concentration. Risk factors for steatosis
were assessed separately in genotype 1 and genotype 3
patients by correlating the percentage of steatosis to the
following parameters: age at liver biopsy, sex ratio, disease
duration, BMI, mean daily alcohol intake, viral load, HOMA
IR, activity score, and intrahepatic iron concentration.
Independent parameters were assessed by multiple regres￾sion. The role of insulin in fibrosis progression was assessed
in genotype 1 patients. The following parameters were
included in a logistic regression model, with extensive
fibrosis (score .1) as a dependent variable: age at liver
biopsy, sex ratio, BMI, fasting serum insulin, activity score,
and percentage of steatosis. Differences were considered
significant at a p value of ,0.05.
RESULTS
Characteristics of genotype 1 and genotype 3 infected
patients
A total of 141 patients met the inclusion criteria. The
distribution of HCV genotypes was as follows: 78 patients
were infected by genotype 1, eight by genotype 2, 28 by
genotype 3, 16 by genotype 4, four by genotype 5, one by
genotype 6, and six had an undetermined genotype. The 113
patients infected with genotypes other than 3 were collected
into a single group termed ‘‘genotype 1 patients’’ and
compared with the 28 patients infected with genotype 3.
Their characteristics are listed in table 1. Both steatosis and
fibrosis were more frequent and more severe in patients
infected with genotype 3 than in those infected with
genotype 1. Other characteristics, in particular those with a
potential impact on both steatosis and fibrosis (namely, age,
disease duration, alcohol consumption, BMI, serum ALT
activity, HOMA index and histological activity score), did not
differ between the two groups.
Insulin resistance is associated with genotype 1
related steatosis but not with genotype 3 related
steatosis
Table 2 shows the main features of patients infected with
genotypes 1 and 3 according to the presence or absence of
significant steatosis. Genotype 1 patients with a fatty liver
were older, had a higher BMI, and were more frequently
insulin resistant than those without a fatty liver or those
infected with genotype 3, even with marked steatosis. These
latter patients had a higher median viral load than that found
in the other groups (table 2). HOMA IR distribution in
patients is presented in fig 1. Median HOMA IR was
significantly higher in patients with genotype 1 related
steatosis than in those with genotype 3 related steatosis or
patients without steatosis. In genotype 1 patients, univariate
analysis showed four parameters significantly linked with the
degree of steatosis: age, BMI, HOMA IR, and hepatic iron

concentration (table 3). Multivariate analysis showed that
HOMA IR was the only variable independently related to
fatty liver in genotype 1 infected patients (table 3, fig 2) while
in patients infected with genotype 3, viral load was the only
variable associated with fatty liver (r = 0.64, p = 0.003, fig 3).
Insulin resistance is specifically associated with
steatosis but not with fibrosis in genotype 1 infected
patients
Genotype 1 infected patients with extensive fibrosis (histo￾logical score .1) had a higher median HOMA IR than others
(1.8 v 1.0; p = 0.0001). However, the association was no
longer significant after adjustment for the degree of steatosis
(fig 4). Serum C peptide/insulin ratio was similar in patients
with or without extensive fibrosis (0.1 (0.03–0.6) v 0.1 (0.03–
0.4); p = 0.8).
Risk factors for insulin resistance in patients infected
with genotype 1
In univariate analysis, seven parameters were significantly
correlated with HOMA IR in patients infected with genotype
1: age at liver biopsy, disease duration, BMI, ALT activity,
activity score, fibrosis score, and percentage of steatosis
(table 4). In multivariate analysis (r
2 = 0.28), only age and
degree of steatosis were independently linked to HOMA IR
(table 4).
Risk factors for extensive fibrosis in patients infected
with genotype 1
Among genotype 1 patients, 34 (30%) had extensive fibrosis
(score.1). In univariate analysis, six parameters were
significantly associated with fibrosis: age, male sex, BMI,
insulinaemia, activity score, and steatosis (table 5). Alcohol
consumption and duration since contamination were not
significantly different between patients with or without
extensive fibrosis (4.7 (10) v 6.6 (11.8) g/day (p = 0.4) and
18.5 (9.7) v 19.4 (7.6) years (p = 0.35), respectively). When
we compared non-drinker patients (n = 89) with those
drinking small amounts of alcohol (n = 29), the prevalence
of extensive fibrosis was not significantly different between
the groups (32 v 24%, respectively; p = 0.04). In multivariate
analysis (r
2 = 0.21), only steatosis and activity score were
independently associated with extensive fibrosis (table 5).
DISCUSSION
This study confirms that the pathophysiology of fatty liver
associated chronic hepatitis C is different in patients infected
with genotype 1 and 3. The study also shows that insulin
resistance in patients infected with genotype 1 is the cause
rather than the consequence of hepatic steatosis and fibrosis,
and suggests that increased circulating insulin is a risk factor
for fibrosis through insulin resistance induced steatosis.
Although steatosis was more severe in patients infected
with genotype 3, insulin resistance was associated with
steatosis only in patients infected with genotype 1. Insulin
resistance depends mainly on age and is a major risk factor
for steatosis, independent of BMI. Steatosis was associated
with more severe fibrosis, whatever the genotype, supporting
the major role of steatosis, whatever its cause, in the
progression of fibrosis. Indeed, while univariate analysis
identified a significant link between circulating insulin level
and fibrosis stage, multivariate analysis revealed that
steatosis, but not insulin, was independently associated with
fibrosis, suggesting an indirect effect of the circulating

insulin level on fibrosis stage through a steatosis related
pathway.
To clarify the intricate relationship between insulin
resistance, steatosis, and fibrosis, the study was performed
in two groups of patients with chronic HCV infection due to
genotype 1 or genotype 3. The results of the present study
confirm the cogency of this distinction as two distinct
mechanisms appear to operate in HCV associated fatty liver.
In genotype 1 infected patients, steatosis was linked to BMI,
while in genotype 3 infected patients, steatosis was related to
HCV viral load. Moreover, we took care to exclude patients
with usual causes of steatosis, such as alcohol, drugs, or
diabetes mellitus. In this selected population, the prevalence
of significant steatosis (>10%) was still high, reaching 60%
in patients infected with genotype 3. These results are in
accordance with previous studies showing a strong associa￾tion between steatosis and genotype 3 infection.4–11 12 Because
cirrhosis is a well known cause of insulin resistance,31
patients with biopsy proven cirrhosis were also excluded.
The mechanisms of development of insulin resistance in
patients with chronic HCV infection are not well understood.
It has been suggested that insulin resistance may result from
steatosis, as excess free fatty acids could downregulate
insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) signalling.32 This concept
was further supported by recent evidence that reversing
hepatic steatosis may improve insulin resistance in rats with
diet induced fatty liver.33 Despite the significant relationship
in genotype 1 infected patients, the lack of association
between steatosis and insulin resistance in genotype 3
infected patients does not support this hypothesis. Shintani
et al showed that insulin resistance preceded the occurrence
of steatosis in transgenic mice expressing HCV core protein,
suggesting that insulin resistance is not a consequence of
hepatic steatosis in these mice.22 As expected, BMI was
correlated with the degree of insulin resistance in univariate
analysis.34 However, in multivariate analysis, the degree of
insulin resistance depended mainly on the age of the patient.
Finally, genotype 1 infected patients with fatty liver were
more insulin resistant than genotype 3 infected patients,
probably because they were older and had higher BMI values.
It has been suggested that age associated decline in
mitochondrial function could contribute to insulin resis￾tance.35 Our results do not exclude other mechanisms. The
higher prevalence of type 2 diabetes in patients with chronic
hepatitis C suggests implementation of HCV infection
itself.14–20 Impaired IRS-1 signalling could be a possible
mechanism, as recently shown in non-obese/non-diabetic
patients with chronic HCV infection.36 In a large cohort study,
Hui et al showed a genotype specific association between
chronic HCV infection and insulin resistance.21 The signifi￾cant link between genotype 1 related steatosis and insulin
resistance in our study population tends to support this
hypothesis.
As in previous studies, we found that steatosis (>10%) was
common among patients with chronic hepatitis C, occurring
in 34% of biopsy specimens.1–3 Our data confirm the strong
correlation between the degree of steatosis and level of HCV
viraemia in genotype 3 infected patients.4 In patients infected
with genotype 1, multivariate analysis demonstrated that
insulin resistance was a risk factor for steatosis, independent
of BMI. These data confirm the existence of two distinct
entities: a group of patients infected with genotype 1 that
may have steatosis secondary to metabolic causes such as
insulin resistance, and a second group infected with genotype
3 that may have steatosis as a direct consequence of HCV
infection.
In patients with chronic hepatitis C, we and others have
shown a significant relationship between the degree of
steatosis and severity of fibrosis.467 In the present study,
steatosis was associated with fibrosis, irrespective of viral
genotype. Because steatosis was associated with insulin
resistance in genotype 1 infected patients, fibrosis could be
the result of hyperinsulinaemia. In fact, it has been
demonstrated that high levels of insulin and glucose could
promote fibrogenesis by stimulating the release of connective
tissue growth factor, a fibrogenic growth factor, from hepatic
stellate cells.37 In genotype 1 infected patients, fibrosis stage
significantly correlated with circulating insulin levels in
univariate analysis. When considering other potential risk
factors of fibrosis, such as steatosis, insulin was no longer an
independent risk factor. The relationship between steatosis
and fibrosis could be explained by several other mechanisms,
such as lipid peroxidation.38–41 According to the ‘‘two hits
hypothesis’’, steatosis could increase the sensitivity of
hepatocytes to oxidative stress, the second hit being HCV
infection itself in patients with chronic hepatitis C.39
Production of reactive oxygen species in an in vitro model
expressing HCV core protein is consistent with this hypoth￾esis.42 The second independent risk factor for fibrosis in the
present study was the histological score of activity. This result
agrees well with the findings of previous longitudinal studies
that showed that the necroinflammatory score was predictive
of the development of severe fibrosis in patients with chronic
hepatitis C.43 44 In our study, neither the duration of
contamination nor alcohol consumption was associated with
fibrosis. The non-linear progression of fibrosis in chronic
hepatitis C probably explains the former result.43 44 In most of
the studies showing a significant association between alcohol
and fibrosis, the cut off value was 20 g/day.5–7 In our study
population, drinking less than 20 g/day, we did not find any
significant effect of small amounts of alcohol on fibrosis.
In conclusion, increased circulating insulin is a risk factor
for fibrosis in genotype 1 infected patients with chronic
hepatitis C through insulin resistance induced steatosis.
Accordingly, it may be speculated that intervention strategies
to reduce insulin resistance associated with steatosis should
