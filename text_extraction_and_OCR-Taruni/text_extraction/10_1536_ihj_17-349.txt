Summary
The aim of this study was to evaluate hepatic dysfunction over 10 years following Fontan surgery. We as￾sessed the clinical usefulness of diagnostic tools for the detection and follow-up of hepatic dysfunction in pa￾tients with Fontan circulation.
A total of 26 post-Fontan patients (median age 13 years, range 10-35 years; median duration from Fontan
procedure 10.5 years, range 4-17 years) were enrolled in this study. Hepatic assessment was performed by ultra￾sonography, computed tomography (CT), and transient elastography (TE) with biochemical tests, echocardiogra￾phy, and cardiac catheterization. Related parameters were compared on the basis of different findings in liver
sonography, CT, and TE.
Liver CT and TE showed abnormal findings in all patients. Liver ultrasonography revealed abnormal re￾sults in 24 patients (92.3%). However, liver function test was normal and did not correlate with imaging studies.
C-reactive protein was significantly correlated with severity of CT findings. White blood cell, platelet count,
and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide were correlated with severity on TE. Post-Fontan high pulmonary
vascular resistance (P = 0.046) and high mean pulmonary artery pressure (P = 0.046) correlated with hepatic
changes on liver CT.
Changes in the liver post-Fontan surgery are common and occur even after 10 years the procedure. Liver
imaging is more sensitive, and CT seems to be more useful for differentiation of severe hepatic changes.

Key words: Fontan procedure, Hepatic dysfunction
First described in 1971, the Fontan operation is now
used widely for patients with single-ventricle
physiology.1) Since the first description of hepatic
fibrosis after the Fontan operation in 1981,2) several stud￾ies have described high-grade hepatic fibrosis and hepatic
cirrhosis in this population. The proposed mechanisms of
hepatic injury and the resulting sinusoidal fibrosis include
increased central and portal venous pressure, decreased
cardiac output, and flow reversal in the hepatic veins.
These changes can cause hepatic injury through hypoxia,
chronic congestion, and stimulation of the fibrotic re￾sponse.3) A recent study reported that portal fibrosis can
occur before the Fontan operation from pre-Fontan in￾sults.4) However, the pathophysiology of hepatic changes
after Fontan operation and the risk factors remain to be
investigated. Liver biopsy has been the standard method
for the assessment of liver problems but is invasive and
costly and has possible complications. Standard imaging
tools for hepatic dysfunction after Fontan operation have
not been clearly established. Recent data indicate that ul￾trasonography can identify Fontan-associated liver disease
before biochemical hepatic dysfunction.5) Transient elasto￾graphy (TE) is a newer tool that has been used for staging
of hepatic fibrosis in adults.6,7) Several studies have exam￾ined whether TE can be used to evaluate Fontan circula￾tion.
This study aimed to investigate the hepatic dysfunc￾tion after Fontan operation and to evaluate the clinical
usefulness of imaging tools of liver ultrasonography, liver
computed tomography (CT), and TE.
Methods
This is a retrospective study based on the review of
medical records. A total of 26 post-Fontan patients were

September 2018 ASSESSMENT OF HEPATIC DYSFUNCTION AFTER FONTAN 1009
the investigation of hemodynamic status and hepatic func￾tion associated with Fontan physiology at about 10 years
after Fontan operation. We confirmed negative for viral
hepatitis and other hepatic congenital or metabolic prob￾lems prior to this investigation. All the investigations were
performed over 2 or 3 days. Liver ultrasonography, liver
CT, and TE were performed with physical examination,
biochemical tests, and echocardiography (Vivid E9, GE
Healthcare) 1 day prior to cardiac catheterization. Liver
ultrasonography was performed by one specialized radi￾ologist, and other radiological images were interpreted by
specialized doctors. Regarding Fontan operation, extracar￾diac Fontan operation with fenestration was performed for
all patients except for one patient, who underwent an ad￾justable fenestrated Fontan operation. Fenestrations were
closed in 22 patients by device closure on catheterization
(19 patients) or spontaneously (3 patients). Only four pa￾tients demonstrated patent fenestration flow.
This study was approved with waiver of consent by
the Ethics Committee of the institute.
Imaging tools for hepatic changes:
Liver ultrasonography All patients underwent liver ultra￾sonography (Sequoia, Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Ger￾many; LOGIQ E9, GE Healthcare, Waukesha, WI, USA).
Chronic parenchymal liver disease (CPLD) was defined as
a heterogeneous parenchymal echotexture. Fibrosis and
liver cirrhosis (LC) were defined as contour nodularity,
blunt margins, right hepatic atrophy, and caudate or left
hepatic lobe hypertrophy on ultrasonography.5,8) Signs of
portal hypertension and extrahepatic manifestation of fi￾brosis or LC were determined by splenomegaly or as￾cites.9,10)
Liver CT Liver CT was performed with multidetector CT
(Light-Speed 16, GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI, USA).
On the basis of CT findings, CPLD was defined as abnor￾mal contrast enhancement (mosaic or reticular patterns)
and nodules (benign focal nodular hyperplasia). LC was
defined similarly as ultrasonography findings-contour
nodularity, blunt margins, right hepatic lobe atrophy, cau￾date or left hepatic lobe hypertrophy, and extrahepatic
manifestations of portal hypertension (enlarged spleen and
enlarged portal vein).8)
Transient elastography Liver stiffness was measured by
TE (FibroscanⓇ, Echosens, France). All liver stiffness
measurements (LSM) were obtained according to the in￾structions provided by the manufacturer. LSM was per￾formed on the right lobe of the liver through the intercos￾tal spaces on patients lying in the dorsal decubitus posi￾tion with the right arm in maximal abduction. The results
are expressed in kilopascals (kPa). The extent of liver fi￾brosis was classified according to the METAVIR scoring
system (F0 = no fibrosis, F1 = portal fibrosis, F2 = bridg￾ing fibrosis with few septa, F3 = bridging fibrosis with
many septa, F4 = cirrhosis). TE cutoff levels used for
staging liver fibrosis F2, F3, and F4 were 8.8, 10.2, and
14.1 kPa, respectively.6,7)
Statistical analysis: Statistical analysis was performed us￾ing Spearman’s correlation coefficient to assess relation￾ships between liver fibrosis and variable parameters.
Kruskal-Wallis test was used for comparing related factors
in ultrasonography and CT. Fisher’s exact test was per￾formed to assess differences among imaging tools. Statis￾tical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) 21.0 soft￾ware program (Chicago, IL, USA) was used for data
analysis. A p value of less than 0.05 was considered sig￾nificant.
Results
Baseline characteristics: Baseline characteristics and bio￾chemical and hemodynamic profiles are shown in Table I.
Demographic characteristics Of the 26 enrolled patients,
17 were male and 9 were female. Median age at investi￾gation was 13.0 years (10.0-35.0 years). Mean duration
from Fontan operation to investigation was 10.5 years
(4.0-17.0 years). The morphology of single ventricle was
right ventricle type in 7 patients, left ventricle type in 11
patients, and undetermined type in 8 patients. Eighteen
patients underwent staged operation for single-ventricle
morphology. The first stage operation was modified BT
shunt in 13 patients, pulmonary artery banding in 5 pa￾tients, and subsequent bidirectional cavopulmonary shunt
(BCPS) in all 18 patients. Six patients skipped over the
first stage operation and underwent BCPS as the first op￾eration. Two patients underwent one-stage Fontan opera￾tion. Mean age at Fontan operation was 3.6 years (1.0-
29.0 years). Four patients required pacemaker implanta￾tion because of conduction problems.
Laboratory biochemical tests The levels of liver enzymes
were within normal range in all patients, as were protein
(6.0-8.2 g/dL) and albumin (3.5-5.2 g/dL). Total bilirubin
was slightly elevated in 3 patients. γ-Glutamyltransferase
(γ-GT) was elevated in 17 patients. White blood cell
(WBC) counts were within normal range in all but 3 pa￾tients. Platelet count was within normal range in all but 1
patient with a value of 122,000 /μL. C-reactive protein
(CRP) was elevated in 2 patients. The coagulation profile
was not included because several patients were taking an
anticoagulant for arrhythmia or coagulopathy. N-terminal
pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) level was ab￾normal only in 3 patients.
Hemodynamic data Echocardiography showed preserved
systemic ventricular function in all patients (ejection frac￾tion, 56.7 ± 8.5%). Systemic atrioventricular valve regur￾gitation was found to be minimal in 14 patients, mild in 6
patients, and moderate to severe in 6 patients. Based on
the cardiac catheterization just before the Fontan opera￾tion, mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) was 9.7
mmHg (range 6.0-16.0 mmHg), and mean pulmonary vas￾cular resistance (PVR) was 2.1 indexed Wood units (range
1.1-4.6 indexed Wood units). At the time of this investiga￾tion, the mean arterial oxygen saturation was 94.7%
(range 91.5-98.0%), mPAP was 12.8 ± 2.3 mmHg (range
8.0-18.0 mmHg), PVR was 1.5 ± 0.7 indexed Wood units
(range 0.6-2.9 indexed Wood units), and ventricular end
diastolic pressure was 10.6 ± 2.9 mmHg (range 4.0-17.0
mmHg).
Comparisons of imaging tools: Figure 1 presents various
degrees of hepatic changes from CT and ultrasonography
that were compared with LSM evaluated by TE in two pa￾tients who underwent Fontan operation around 10 years
ago.

Liver ultrasonography All patients underwent liver ultra￾sonography, and 24 patients (92%) had abnormal ultra￾sound findings that were classified as CPLD. No patient
had cirrhotic change demonstrated by liver ultrasonogra￾phy. There were no differences between patients with nor￾mal and abnormal ultrasonographic findings.
Liver CT Nineteen patients underwent liver CT. All pa￾tients had abnormal CT findings, compatible with CPLD
in 13 patients and with LC in 6 patients. There were no
cases of hepatocellular carcinoma. Table II shows the dif￾ferences in related clinical factors between patients with
CPLD and those with LC on liver CT. All biochemical
tests for liver function showed normal findings and did
not prove any correlate with CT findings. However, CRP
in patients with LC was significantly higher than that in
the other patients (0.04 ± 0.02 versus 0.49 ± 0.61, P =
0.046).
For hemodynamic parameters, although transhepatic
pressure (HP) gradient, ventricular EDP, and RA pressure
before Fontan operation were not different between pa￾tients with CPLD and LC on liver CT, mean PA and PVR
were significantly higher in the LC group (12.07 ± 1.75
versus 14.50 ± 2.73 and 1.35 ± 0.70 versus 2.08 ± 0.54,
P = 0.046).
Transient elastography All 26 patients showed abnormal
results in TE (18.2 ± 3.3 kPa). Compared with the refer￾ence range of hepatitis B or hepatitis C, all patients were
in hepatic fibrosis stage (stage 2 in 1 patient, stage 3 in 3
patients, and stage 4 in 22 patients). The extent of liver fi￾brosis had a significant correlation with WBC (r = -0.48,
P = 0.025) and platelet count (r = -0.47, P = 0.022) and
NT-proBNP (r = 0.49, P = 0.019) (Figure 2), whereas no
significant correlations with age of investigation, time
from Fontan operation, mean PAP, PVR, CRP, and albu￾min level were proved (P > 0.05).
Discussion
Our study revealed that all patients had abnormal re￾sults on liver imaging studies despite normal results from
liver function tests. Although liver ultrasonography and
TE showed hepatic changes after Fontan operation, liver
CT seems to be more useful to differentiate liver paren￾chymal disease and cirrhosis in asymptomatic Fontan pa￾tients.
Many previous reports have focused on hepatic dys￾function after Fontan operation. Ghaferi, et al.11) reported
that chronically increased hepatic venous pressure from
Fontan surgery might lead to chronic passive congestion,
cardiac cirrhosis, hepatic adenoma, and hepatocellular car￾cinoma, although our data showed no significant correla￾tion with HP or fibrotic change. As chronic liver disease
progresses, hepatic fibrosis is accompanied by the forma￾tion of septae and nodules that interfere with the portal
blood flow, leading to portal hypertension and formation
of the distinctive cirrhotic architecture.12) The histologic
changes identified on liver biopsy of adult Fontan patients
are similar to those that occur with chronic passive liver

boy, 10 years after Fontan procedure: liver ultrasound showed normal size with scattered small echogenic nodules and 
coarse echogenicity that was compatible with chronic parenchymal changes (A). CT showed no focal lesions but 
chronic hepatic parenchymal changes. LSM (TE) of this patient was 17.3 kPa (B). C, D: An 11-year-old boy, 6 years 
after Fontan procedure: liver ultrasonography showed several hyperechogenic nodular lesions and peri-portal echo￾genic thickening that suggested chronic liver disease (C). CT showed severe hepatic congestion and surface nodularity
which was compatible with liver cirrhosis after Fontan operation. LSM (TE) of this patient was 18.0 kPa (D). CT,

congestion due to right-side heart failure.3,11) Several fac￾tors have been shown to be associated with hepatic com￾plications in the Fontan group.3,11,13,14) Duration of Fontan
circulation, Fontan type, decreased ventricular function,
absence of initial fenestration, thrombus in Fontan tract,
and arrhythmia were considered as risk factors, but dura￾tion after Fontan operation was the only significant factor
in multivariate analysis.3) Hepatic dysfunction correlated
with the duration of Fontan circulation in several other
studies.15,16) Camposilvan, et al.14) reported that liver dys￾function over the long term is correlated with reduced car￾diac index after Fontan operation. The reversibility of he￾patic dysfunction has not been known even though Fontan
hemodynamics might be getting better with several pul￾monary vasodilators17) and cardiac synchronization.18) The
findings of liver ultrasonography may be dependent on the
skill of the operator, as they may not exactly reflect the
whole liver parenchymal injury. Two cases in our study
had normal liver ultrasonography findings but liver CT
findings compatible with CPLD.
In our study, the group with CT findings of cirrhosis
(or fibrosis) showed higher mPAP and PVR than the
group with CPLD findings at the last follow-up after Fon￾tan operation. CT findings were not related to HP or he￾patic wedge pressure (HWP) at the last follow-up study.
Our results are similar to the findings of Fred, et al.
19)
which showed no significant positive correlation between
fibrosis and HP. However, Kiesewetter, et al.3) reported
that HP and HWP were related to hepatic fibrosis in liver
biopsy. High RA pressure, high PVR, and high PAP be￾fore Fontan operation seemed to be unrelated to liver
damage after the Fontan operation. It is already known
that a certain time is required for hepatic changes. Our
study was a cross-sectional study performed over 10 years
in patients after Fontan operation. Even young patients
showed hepatic changes just 10 years after Fontan opera￾tion. Hepatic changes seem to develop earlier than ex￾pected, necessitating aggressive follow-up.
The usefulness of TE for viral hepatitis in children
and adults is accepted.20) In our study, TE yielded abnor￾mal results in Fontan patients, and the value of LSM was
very high. Yoo, et al.21) reported that the LSM of TE in
Fontan circulation is strikingly greater than the normal
range (<5.5 kPa) and also higher than that of patients with
right-side heart failure. Therefore, there is a limitation in
applying the value of LSM from patients with viral hepa￾titis patients to the Fontan circulation because of the lack
of sufficient data from a large-scale study in Fontan pa￾tients. Although TE could not accurately reflect the degree
of liver dysfunction, it is still a useful tool for follow-up,

considering the simplicity of the test. Wu, et al.22) reported
that TE was significantly correlated with Fontan pressure
and cardiac index. High LSM on TE can be a guide for
identifying Fontan patients requiring invasive study. In our
study, WBC and platelet count and NT-proBNP level cor￾related with LSM severity. Inflammation may be related
to liver dysfunction in Fontan circulation, and the high
CRP level in the LC group in our study appears to sup￾port this. Similar to the data of Wu, et al.,
22) LSM severity
on TE was correlated with low platelet count in our study.
Thrombocytopenia is known to be a characteristic feature
of chronic liver disease and cirrhosis.23)
In our study, laboratory findings associated with liver
function (liver enzyme, platelet count, and bilirubin) were
normal, but γ-GT was higher in all except one patient.
Kaulitz, et al.24) reported similar findings of correlations
between hepatic changes and ventricular EDP and mPAP.
Hepatic transaminase often remains normal despite the
presence of significant hepatic derangement.25) Liver func￾tion studies as a follow-up tool after Fontan operation
have limitations, and data suggest that an imaging study is
required.19,25,26)
Because liver changes develop earlier in single￾ventricle physiology, especially after Fontan operation,
early detection of hepatic changes is important. Although
TE and liver ultrasonography are noninvasive and feasible
methods to detect hepatic changes, liver CT is more use￾ful for evaluating objective hepatic changes and their pro￾gression.
Limitation: Our study has the limitations of a retrospec￾tive study and of small sample size. Consequently, we
could not perform multivariable regression analysis, and it
is difficult to ensure the accuracy of risk factors of liver
dysfunction. Additional study with a larger study popula￾tion is considered necessary. TE has been studied and
validated in patients with hepatitis B and hepatitis C but
has not been validated in the Fontan population. In spite
of these limitations, analysis of the image is relatively im￾portant because liver biopsy is often not possible in a pa￾tient with liver disease associated with Fontan circulation.
Conclusions
Fontan circulation is known to be associated with
high risk of hepatic dysfunction. Because biochemical
liver function testing has limitations, various imaging
tools should be considered for early detection of hepatic
dysfunction even in early period after Fontan operation.
Even though liver ultrasonography and TE may be recom￾mendable for initial screening and follow-up, liver CT
seems to be a better tool for differentiating serious hepatic
dysfunction such as LC.
