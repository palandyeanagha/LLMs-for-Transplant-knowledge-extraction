86 Abstract
87 Background
88 Using cell-based medicinal products (CBMPs) represents a state-of-the-art approach to reducing 
89 general immunosuppression in organ transplantation. Accordingly, The ONE Study Consortium tested 
90 multiple regulatory CBMPs in kidney transplant (KTx) trials. Here, we report primary analysis results 
91 for safety of regulatory CBMPs when combined with reduced immunosuppressive treatment in this 
92 first ONE Study publication.
93 Methods
94 Seven investigator-led single-armed trials were conducted internationally in living-donor KTx 
95 recipients (60 week follow-up). One single-arm trial, the Reference Group Trial (RGT, n=66), 
96 represents a “standard-of-care” group given basiliximab, tapered steroids, mycophenolate mofetil 
97 (MMF) and tacrolimus. Data from six non-randomized phase I/IIa cell therapy group (CTG) trials were 
98 pooled and analyzed, where patients (n=38) received one of six CBMPs containing regulatory T cells, 
99 dendritic cells or macrophages; patient selection and immunosuppression mirrored the RGT, except 
100 basiliximab induction was substituted with CBMPs and MMF tapering was allowed. The primary 
101 endpoint was biopsy-confirmed acute rejection (BCAR); adverse event (AE) coding was centralized.
102 Findings
103 Standard-of-care immunosuppression in the RGT recipients resulted in a 12·1% BCAR rate (expected 
104 range: 3·2-18·0%). The 6 CBMPs for the parallel CTG trials were administered to a combined total of 
105 38 patients, with an overall BCAR rate of 15·8%. 15 CBMP-treated patients (39·5%) were successfully 
106 weaned from MMF and maintained on tacrolimus monotherapy. Combined AE data and BCAR 
107 episodes from all six CTG trials revealed no safety concerns versus the RGT. Fewer episodes of 
108 infections were registered in CTG trials versus the RGT. 
109 Interpretation
110 Regulatory cell therapy is achievable and safe in living-donor KTx recipients, and is associated with 
111 fewer infectious complications, but comparable rejection rates in the first year.

121 Introduction
122 Combinations of general immunosuppressive drugs have enabled the widespread application of life￾123 saving organ transplantation today; however, transplant survival is limited and has plateaued over 
the last decade,1 124 leaving the dilemma of needing to replace damaged transplanted organs in a world 
125 where not enough organs are available, while the morbidity and economic costs associated with life￾126 long general immunosuppression accrue. To address this problem, the organ transplantation 
127 community is well-aware that new strategies are urgently needed to decrease our dependency on 
immunosuppressive drugs to prevent allograft rejection.2 128 Indeed, international networks have been 
129 established with this explicit purpose in mind, notably including a series of European Union-funded 
130 programs and, in North America, the Immune Tolerance Network. Research from these expert 
131 networks, and from numerous research laboratories across the globe, consistently call for novel 
132 therapies that will reduce our reliance on “full” immunosuppression to prevent organ rejection. At 
133 least two general strategies have been considered, including a deletional approach based on 
134 establishment of donor bone marrow chimerism to reduce donor-reactive immune cells, and an 
135 immune regulation-based approach that takes advantage of regulatory cells or pathways that control 
immunity and restrain immune responses to autologous antigens.3 136 Although protocols to create 
137 chimerism in organ transplant recipients have been trialed for more than a decade, finding 
138 conditioning regimens with acceptable toxicity and avoiding the problem of graft-versus-host disease 
139 has been a persistent obstacle. Regarding the second strategy of building immune regulation, a 
140 therapeutic means to augment these cellular networks has only recently come of age for clinical 
141 testing.
142 Regulatory cell therapy has emerged as one attractive therapeutic approach to establish immune 
regulation aimed at protecting organ allografts.4-6 143 The overall principle of this approach is to expand 
144 specific regulatory immune cell populations ex vivo in the form of cell-based medicinal products 
145 (CBMPs) that can then be infused into transplant recipients. Towards this aim, a European Union￾146 funded consortium called The ONE Study was initiated with the aim of developing a range of CBMPs

6
147 and to test those cell products in early-phase clinical trials. The six CBMPs developed and tested in six 
148 parallel cell therapy group (CTG) trials (<12 patients each) in The ONE Study included two polyclonal T 
149 regulatory (pTreg), two donor-antigen reactive Treg (darTreg), one tolerogenic DC (ATDC) and one 
150 regulatory macrophage (Mreg) cell products. Central to the concept of The ONE Study was that all 
151 CBMPs be tested using the equivalent patient population of living-donor kidney transplant (KTx) 
152 recipients that receive the identical background immunosuppressive treatment, placing testing of the 
153 six CBMPs on a directly comparable basis. Also fundamental to this study was that a larger Reference 
154 Group Trial (RGT) be conducted on an equivalent patient population using standard-of-care 
155 immunosuppression. While the RGT is not strictly a true control group due to inclusion of basiliximab 
156 in place of cell therapy, it serves two purposes. First, since we have applied our CBMPs under similar, 
157 but reduced, immunosuppression, the RGT provides a recognized standard-of-care benchmark to 
158 assess whether currently expected outcomes are generally attainable with regulatory cell therapy 
159 with less immunosuppression. Second, with a standard-of-care RGT, performance of centralized 
160 immune monitoring allows for reliable detection of potential immunological changes caused by cell 
161 therapy. Here, we present the special design, clinical data, safety results and immune monitoring 
162 data of the ONE Study RGT and combined CTG group of trials, which is intended as a foundation for 
163 further regulatory cell therapy trials in organ transplantation.

165 Methods
166 Study design and participants
167 The ONE Study aimed to explore the safety and immunological effects of regulatory cell-based 
168 therapy as an adjunct immunosuppressive treatment in living-donor kidney transplant recipients 
169 through a series of clinical trials sharing the same general design. Therefore, we created a multi-trial 
170 design strategy to facilitate: 1) comparison of different cell therapy trials versus standard-of-care 
171 treatment, and 2) comparison of cell therapy trials to each other. In total, seven trials were 
172 performed, the first being the single-arm multi-center RGT conducted at all clinical sites that were 
173 planning to perform an individual cell therapy trial. The RGT formed the basis for the other six 
174 individual trials testing CBMPs (the CTG trials). Chronologically, enrollment for the RGT was 
175 completed before any of the CTG trials commenced; the RGT was initiated while regulatory approvals 
176 for the CTG trials and cell manufacturing procedures were being obtained. 
177
178 CBMPs. In the course of The ONE Study project, six regulatory cell products were approved for 
179 manufacture and therapeutic testing in the CTG trials by the national competent authority in each 
180 participating country. Two of the six cell products consisted of polyclonal natural T regulatory cells 
approved respectively in the United Kingdom (“pTreg-1”)7 and Berlin (“pTreg-2”)8 181 . The third and 
182 fourth cell products consisted of Treg, but were generated in the presence of donor antigen during 
183 manufacturing; one product was exposed under conditions of costimulatory blockade in the 
presence of donor peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in Boston9 184 (referred to as 
185 costimulatory blockade “darTreg-CSB”) and the other product was developed in San Francisco where 
186 Tregs sorted from PBMCs were stimulated with donor B cells that had been activated with K562 cells 
expressing human CD40L (referred to as donor alloantigen-reactive “darTreg-sBC”)10 187 . The fifth and 
188 sixth cell products were derived from peripheral blood monocytes, where monocytes were 
stimulated in Nantes with GM-CSF to produce autologous tolerogenic dendritic cells (“ATDC”),11 189 or in 
Regensburg with M-CSF and IFN- to produce regulatory macrophages (“Mreg-UKR”)12 190 . All six 

8
191 regulatory cell products were derived from recipient leucocytes (blood or leucopheresates), with the 
192 exception that Mreg-UKR were donor-derived. Table S1 provides an overview of the overall 
193 characteristics of the CBMPs, including a reference to cell production methods.
194
195 Patient selection for trials. Living-donor KTx recipients were selected for inclusion into all seven trials. 
196 Living donors were chosen for these trials to allow for maximal planning logistics with regard to 
197 obtaining informed consent, having a medically stable recipient population, coordinating regulatory 
198 cell manufacturing from donor or recipient cells (in the CTG trials) and obtaining pre-transplant 
199 immune monitoring samples. The core inclusion and exclusion criteria that were common to all trials
200 for both the donors and recipients are listed in Table S2. The main exclusion criteria were patients 
201 transplanted previously, high risk recipients (PRA >40%) and HLA identical donor-recipient 
202 mismatches (0-0-0 mismatches); all patients needed to be >18 years old. 
203
204 RGT treatment protocol. The ONE Study group of clinicians developed the RGT immunosuppression 
205 design based on their own local standard-of-care protocols, which included some features of the 
ELITE-Symphony study13 206 , for the selected non-high risk KTx patient population. The study protocol
207 (clinicaltrials.gov: NCT01656135) consisted of: basiliximab administration <2 hours before transplant 
208 surgery and on day 4 after surgery (20mg i.v.); prednisolone starting on day 0 (day of KTx) and 
209 gradually tapered away by week 15; mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) at 2 g/day from day -1 to day 
210 +14 and 1.5 g/day thereafter; and tacrolimus starting on day -4 at 3-12 ng/ml and gradually reduced 
211 over 9 months to 3-6 ng/ml. A diagram showing the exact dosing scheme can be found in Fig. S1.
212 Patient follow-up was continued for 60 weeks. The target recruitment figure for the RGT was 60 
213 patients.
214
215 CTG treatment protocol. The clinical protocol for the six CTG trials closely mirrors the regimen for the 
216 RGT (Fig. S1). All cell products were delivered once intravenously between day -7 and day +10 

9
217 relative to the day of KTx; within this timeframe, monocyte-derived cell products were administered 
218 before KTx and T cell-derived products were given after KTx. The exact cell numbers infused will be 
219 provided in the individual CTG trial descriptions to be reported elsewhere, but ranged from 0·5 to 10 
x 106
cells/Kg BW for all cell products except darTreg-CSB, where a range between 2 x 103
- 2 x 106 220
221 cells/Kg BW was targeted. Pharmacological immunosuppression and dosing were the same as with 
222 the RGT, except that basiliximab induction therapy was omitted, and at 9 months post-KTx an option 
223 was included to completely taper away MMF by one year post-KTx; with MMF cessation, tacrolimus 
224 continued as a monotherapy. Tapering of MMF was not allowed if an immediately prior KTx biopsy 
225 showed signs of subclinical rejection or there was evidence of declining renal function. Patient 
226 follow-up continued for approximately 60 weeks, after which time immunosuppressive treatment 
227 was decided by the local transplant physician. The number of cell therapy-treated patients did not 
228 exceed 12 in any individual CTG trial. All CTG trials are registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02252055, 
229 NCT02085629, NCT02244801, NCT02371434, NCT02129881 and NCT02091232).
230
231 Sites performing trials. The multicenter RGT was performed at eight international locations, including 
232 the University Hospital Regensburg (Regensburg, Germany), Charité (Berlin, Germany), Centre 
233 Hospitalier Universitaire Nantes (Nantes, France), Ospedale San Raffaele (Milan, Italy), Oxford 
234 University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust (Oxford, UK), Guy’s Hospital (London, UK), Massachusetts 
235 General Hospital (Boston, MA) and UCSF Medical Center (San Francisco, CA) (Fig. 1). After completing 
236 enrollment for the RGT, seven centers conducted a separate CTG trial with one of six regulatory cell 
237 products (see above). Unlike the five centers that recruited patients into their respective single￾238 center CTG trials, the Oxford and London sites joined forces to recruit patients into one CTG trial 
239 (pTreg-1). Notably, the Milan site participated only in the RGT, since their cell product was not 
240 approved for clinical trial testing during The ONE Study.
241

10
242 Endpoints. Biopsy-confirmed acute rejection (BCAR) was the primary endpoint. Histopathological 
243 grading of KTx biopsies was performed by a central pathologist (Prof. Ian Roberts, Oxford University) 
244 for all trials within The ONE Study, with the standard assessment performed according to the Banff 
criteria.14 245 Notably, a case of borderline histological change in a for-cause biopsy with clinical evidence 
246 of acute rejection was considered a BCAR. However, histological changes consistent with acute 
247 rejection that were not accompanied by clinical evidence of rejection were not recorded as a BCAR, 
248 but were logged as a secondary endpoint. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR: MDRD method) 
249 was recorded as a secondary endpoint. 
250
251 For the RGT, we estimated a BCAR rate of approximately 10% after 60 weeks under standard 
252 immunosuppressive therapy in the select KTx patient population. With this assumption, a two-sided 
253 95% confidence interval for a single proportion of 0·106 predicts a rejection rate ranging from 3·2-
254 18·0% with a sample size of 66 patients; a BCAR rate falling outside this interval would suggest that 
255 the rejection rate is atypical. 
256
257 Clinical data collection and monitoring. Clinical data from all trials were entered into a web-based 
258 data capture platform consisting of electronic case report forms (eCRF) custom-made for The ONE 
259 Study (Koehler eClinical, Freiburg, Germany). A core set of clinical data were collected from all trials 
260 to ensure that these parameters could be directly compared. Selected data items for evaluation of 
261 the study endpoints were verified for accuracy against source documents during on-site monitoring 
262 visits performed by qualified CRAs. Additionally, data were reviewed, queried and cleaned remotely 
263 by a central team of data managers using both automatic and manual data validation checks. All 
264 adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) were coded centrally using version 20.1 of 
265 the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) and quality-controlled to ensure 
266 consistency of coding across all trials and study sites. To compare safety events reported from 
267 cohorts of different sizes, (S)AE frequencies were normalized using a cohort-specific “Patient Study 

11
268 Years” (PSY) denominator. PSY is the cumulative amount of time spent by trial participants in study 
269 follow-up and was calculated and applied for RGT and CGT separately. A safety advisory board (SAB) 
270 received SAE reports for all CTG trials as they occurred and reviewed all safety data twice per year. 
271 To be sure of open communication within The ONE Study trial series, safety alerts or conclusions 
272 from the SAB were shared with all centers performing CTG trials.
273
274 Immune monitoring. We used a mixed model of locally and centrally performed assays to compare 
pre- and post-transplant immune status of RGT and CTG trial patients.15 275 The following analyses were 
276 performed as provided in supplementary materials: immune cell composition by whole blood flow 
277 cytometry, TSDR demethylation gene expression (see Supplementary Methods) and anti-donor as 
278 well as anti-CMV IFNg EliSpot. To reveal differences in peripheral blood immune cell composition 
279 between patients with end-stage renal disease (RGT and CTG before transplantation) and healthy 
280 individuals, we performed comparative analyses with age-and gender-matched healthy controls from 
our recently generated cohort data set.16 281 
282
283 Statistical analyses. A statistical analysis plan defined the conventions and analyses, and emphasized 
284 the exploratory nature of the ONE Study, accordingly the proposed statistical examination of clinical 
285 data was descriptive. The reported comparative analyses of changes in immune cell composition and 
286 functionality between RGT and CTG patients were done as post-hoc analyses. 
287
288 For clinical data, results for baseline characteristics, safety and transplant function or rejection 
289 endpoints were summarized descriptively. No formal testing was performed. In addition to crude 
290 rejection rates, time to first BCAR was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier methods. The primary BCAR 
291 endpoint is reported descriptively for the intention-to-treat population (RGT, n=66; CTG, n=38); the 
292 time-to-event Kaplan-Meier BCAR analysis is presented for both the intention-to-treat (66/38, 
293 respectively) and per-protocol (47/32, respectively) populations. All other variables (DSA, eGFR, 

12
294 tacrolimus levels) are summarized for the number of patients who were tested at the relevant study 
295 time points. Incidence rates of adverse events normalized per 100 patient study years were 
296 calculated and based on the intention-to-treat population.
297
298 Differences in immune monitoring results between RGT patients prior to transplantation and healthy 
299 controls were analyzed applying Kruskal Wallis tests followed by Dunn-Bonferroni tests. Changes 
300 between pre-transplant and post-transplant time points of the same patient were analyzed applying 
301 Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test. To reveal differences in immune cell composition or TSDR 
302 changes after transplantation between RGT and CTG patients, we employed a Kruskal Wallis and a 
303 post-hoc Dunn’s multiple comparison test. P values <0·05 were considered as significant.
304
305 Role of the funding source. The funders had no role in data collection, analysis, interpretation or 
306 writing of the manuscript. EKG, as the ONE Study Consortium FP7 project coordinator, had access to 
307 all the data in the study; BS also had access to the full data set. As a group, members of this FP7 
308 consortium discussed the publication plans, and therefore were involved in the decision to submit 
309 the manuscript; EKG and BS had the final responsibility in this decision.

310 Results
311 Results from clinical trials
312 RGT and CTG trials conduct. Recruitment to the RGT began in December 2012, with the last patient￾313 last visit in December 2015. Fig. 1 shows that 70 patients were enrolled in the RGT in total (red arrow 
314 bars), with 66 receiving a KTx. Of the four pre-KTx withdrawals, two had their transplant postponed, 
315 one patient needed treatment for DSA that did not allow further inclusion into the study protocol, 
316 and one patient withdrew consent. 61 RGT patients completed the study: of the five who were non￾317 completers, one patient withdrew consent (at 8 days), one patient was lost to follow-up (at 33 
318 weeks), one patient had a major vascular complication and graft loss (at 8 days), one patient received 
319 ATG instead of basiliximab induction therapy (discovered on day 11), and one patient violated the 
320 eligibility criteria (noted at 24 weeks). None of these five patients registered a primary endpoint. In 
321 the RGT, median follow-up time was 60·1 weeks (IQR 1·3 weeks). Fig. 1 also summarizes patient 
322 recruitment into the six individual CTG trials (non-red arrow bars), where a total of 60 patients were 
323 recruited into the various trials, with the first patient-first visit conducted in May 2014 and the last 
324 patient-last visit done in November 2018. Of the 60 enrolled patients, 38 received a KTx and the 
325 designated cell therapy. All of these patients completed the 60 week follow-up planned in the ONE 
326 Study. The 22 patients withdrawn were due to one of the following: cell manufacturing failures (14), 
327 early development of acute rejection before the planned cell infusion (5), discovery of ineligibility 
328 criteria after enrollment (2) or requirement for a second abdominal surgery shortly after KTx (1). Cell 
329 manufacturing failures were because of failure to meet release criteria (9), cancellation (2), 
330 microbiology testing positive (2) and leucapheresis side effects (1); no trial was stopped due to lack 
331 of manufacturing feasibility. In the CTG, median follow-up time was 60·0 weeks (IQR 0·6 weeks). A 
332 summary of the recipient and donor demographic data for the RGT and CTG trials is provided (Tables 
333 S3 and S4). Data on recipient and donor age, gender, ethnicity, renal replacement therapy, 
334 relationship of donor and recipient, and underlying diagnosis show that the RGT and combined CTG 
335 trials were well-balanced. Notably, both the RGT and combined CTG trials have a nearly identical 

14
336 over-representation of male recipients; since gender-related effects are known in transplantation, 
337 this should be taken into consideration when interpreting the results.
338
339 A set of per protocol criteria were defined based mostly on overall adherence to the planned 
340 immunosuppression regime in both the RGT and CTG trials (criteria listed in Table S5). In the RGT, 47 
341 of 66 KTx patients (71·2%) received treatment that closely followed the clinical protocol, whereas 32 
342 of the 38 patients (84·2%) in the CTG trials were treated with close adherence to the protocol. 
343 Reasons for non-adherence varied widely among the trials, but were mostly related to adjustments 
344 or switching of immunosuppression that the treating physician deemed necessary. Furthermore, ONE 
345 Study physicians performing the CTG trials tapered immunosuppression to tacrolimus monotherapy 
346 (optional) in 17 of 38 (44·7%) patients. The immunosuppression was successfully tapered in all but 
347 two cases, where triple therapy was later reinstated due to a BCAR and detection of recurrent IgA 
348 nephropathy, respectively. 
349
350 Outcomes (BCAR rate, GFR, DSA, tacrolimus levels)
351 BCAR rate in the RGT was 12·1% (8/66), which is within the expected range of 3·2-18·0%. BCAR 
352 occurred in 15·8% (6/38) of the patients receiving cell therapy within the combined CTG trials, which 
353 was within the expected range calculated for the RGT. The Kaplan-Meier curves in Fig. 2A highlight 
354 the early incidence of BCARs in all trials. The severity of the first BCAR by Banff scoring was 
355 distributed similarly between the RGT and the group of CTG trials (Fig. 2B); one patient in the RGT 
356 experienced a second BCAR episode, but other BCARs in all trials were single episodes and were 
357 successfully treated. Only one of eight first BCAR episodes in the RGT occurred after two weeks post￾358 KTx; similarly, 4 of 6 episodes of BCAR in the CTG group trials occurred before three weeks post-KTx. 
359 Specific BCAR data from individual sites will be published separately for each CTG trial. In addition, 
360 we also performed a Kaplan-Meier analysis for the “per protocol” patients in the RGT and group of 
361 CTG trials (Fig. 2C); the rate and timing of the BCAR episodes were essentially the same.

15
362
363 A set of tests was performed at study end (60 weeks) to further assess outcomes in the trials, 
364 including DSA detection, eGFR and tacrolimus blood levels. At study end, DSA testing revealed that 
365 13·7% (7/51 tested) of RGT recipients had a DSA, with 15·2% (5/33 tested) showing DSA in the 
366 combined CTG trials; of the CTG patients tapered to monotherapy, 13·3% (2/15 tested) had a new 
367 DSA. Regarding kidney function (Fig. S2), eGFR measurements in the RGT and CTG trials showed an 
368 almost identical increase over the study period (20·4% and 20·8%, respectively) when comparing 
369 median eGFR at 60 weeks post-KTx to median eGFR at one week post-KTx. As a reflection of 
370 immunosuppressive load at study end, tacrolimus trough levels were found to be similar in the RGT 
371 and combined CTG trials, at 6·1 ± 2·1 (meanSD; n=44 tested) and 6·6 ± 1·6 ng/ml (meanSD; n=32
372 tested), respectively. Furthermore, immunosuppressive burden with tacrolimus (trough level: Fig. 
373 S3A, B) and MMF (dose: Fig. S3C, D) was similar or even tended to be lower throughout the study 
374 period in the CTG versus RGT patients. Together, these data should be considered with the 
375 understanding that 15 patients (39·5%) in the CTG trials were on tacrolimus monotherapy at study 
376 end, whereas 98·4% (60/61) of patients in the RGT continued on at least dual immunosuppression. 
377
378 Safety Data
379 The normalized incidence rates of treatment-emergent SAEs/AEs in the RGT (n=66) and CTG trials 
380 (n=38) were 91·2/1614.6 and 70·7/1452.0 events per 100 PSY, respectively, indicating no increase in 
381 adverse events with cell therapy (Table S6). In the CTG trials, there was special attention given to 
382 identifying SAEs/AEs related to cell therapy infusion. Overall, there were 12 AEs reported with a 
383 possible relationship to the cell infusion, only one of which was a serious incident (an SAE; increased 
384 creatinine) (Table S7). All potentially related adverse events only occurred once, so no specific 
385 pattern was exposed in the 38 patients treated with CBMPs. No deaths were reported in any of the 
386 trials.
387

16
388 A descriptive analysis of normalized data comparing MedDRA-coded SAEs in the RGT versus the 
389 combined data from the CTG trials revealed that most serious medical problems were similar in 
390 frequency (Fig. 3A). However, there was one substantial difference that emerged which is worth 
391 considering in detail. The incidence rate of SAEs in the RGT related to infections and infestations was
392 nearly six-fold higher compared to the combined CTG trials. After examining all infection-related 
393 adverse events (AEs) recorded in the trials, this pattern of decreased infections in the CTG trials was 
394 consistently observed across the CTG trials (Fig. 3B) and was evident during the entire post-KTx 
395 observation period (Fig. 3C). Also interestingly, we found that the main difference was with regard to 
396 a reduced number of viral infections in the CTG trials (Fig. 3D); notably, there was also an appreciable 
397 difference in the number of infections recorded without specifying the pathogen, but numbers of 
398 bacterial and fungal infections were essentially the same. Breaking the data down even further 
399 regarding AEs, the main decreases in viral infections in the CTG trials were with regard to CMV, 
400 herpes (including herpes simplex, herpes-zoster, oral herpes, nasal herpes and Varicella-zoster) and 
401 polyoma virus (Fig. 3E). The decreased rate of viral infection in the CTG was not due to more 
402 preventive measures, since 65·2% (43/66) RGT and 52·6% (20/38) CTG patients received anti-viral
prophylaxis in the first three months after KTx; also, notably, the percentage of CMV+
to CMV- 403 donor 
404 to recipient transplants was 18·2% and 21·1% in the RGT and CTG trials, respectively. Therefore, 
405 patients receiving cell therapy in general developed fewer viral infections compared to patients 
406 receiving standard-of-care treatment.
407
408 Immune monitoring results
409 Identical standardized immune monitoring testing of peripheral blood cells was performed in all 
410 patients of the seven trials. In general, principal component analyses show that RGT patients prior to 
411 KTx have major alterations in absolute and relative blood immune cell population composition 
412 compared to age- and gender-matched healthy controls (Fig. 4A). Populations contributing most to 
those alterations were granulocytes, CD16+ mDCs and CD14highCD16+ 413 intermediate monocytes, which 

17
414 were increased in RGT patient samples, but also plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs), marginal zone-like B cells 
(MZB) and CD8+CD28+ 415 T cells which were higher in samples of healthy controls (Fig. 4B). Post-KTx 
416 longitudinal analysis revealed only moderate or absent normalization of CD16-expressing monocytes 
and MZB, respectively (Fig. 4C). Furthermore, whereas composition of conventional CD4+ 417 T cells 
subsets remained normal and comparable to healthy controls, CD8+ 418 T cells subset composition showed 
419 major alterations over the post-KTx course. Although naïve T cells increased early after transplantation, 
we observed a skewing towards terminal differentiation of CD8+ 420 T cells in the long-term (Fig. 4C). 
421
422 Examining immunophenotyping results from the RGT and combined CTG trials, we did not observe 
significant differences in numbers or proportions of CD4+CD25highCD127low 423 Tregs between the groups 
424 at 15 months post-KTx (Fig. 5A). A significant reduction in TSDR demethylation occurred in RGT 
425 patients, but not in CTG trial patients. Furthermore, only RTG patients showed a significant increase in 
CD8+ TEMRA cells and CD8+CD57+ 426 chronically-activated T cells (Fig. 5B), whereas in samples from CTG 
patients we observed more CD8+CD28+ 427 T cells. Both patient groups showed a reduction of donor￾428 specific IFN producing memory T cells after KTx (Fig. S4A). However, RGT patients in contrast to CTG 
patients showed higher anti-CMV T cell responses (Fig. S4B), which correlated with absolute CD8+ 429 TEMRA
430 numbers (Fig. S4C). This increase is well known in KTx patients and is likely related to inflammation 
431 triggered subclinical reactivation of CMV, which we also only observed in RGT but not CTG patients 
432 (Fig. 3E). Although both patient groups had more pDCs 15 months post-KTx, we only observed a 
normalization of MZB numbers and a significant reduction of CD14highCD16 433 + monocytes in CTG patients 
434 (Fig. 5C). In addition, CTG patients showed increased mRNA expression of genes described to be high 
435 in immunosuppression-free operationally tolerant kidney transplant patients (e.g. Ms4A1) and co￾436 inhibitory molecules (CD200), but reduced expression of rejection-associated genes (HMMR, Fig. S4D).
437 Together, these data suggest that regulatory cell therapy within our trials CTG patients show a more 
438 healthy control-like restoration of immune cell composition.
439

440 Discussion
441 The ONE Study consortium has taken the unique approach of performing side-by-side trialing of 
442 different T cell, DC and macrophage regulatory cell products in low to medium risk KTx recipients. In 
443 this coordinated group of six international early phase clinical trials (the CTG trials), we show that 
444 CBMP application in this patient population is feasible for multiple regulatory cell types, and their 
445 categorical application near the time of KTx reveals no apparent safety concerns, including allograft 
446 rejection rate. Furthermore, 15 of the 38 patients treated with CBMPs were successfully weaned to 
447 tacrolimus monotherapy during the 60 week observation period. The conduct of a parallel reference 
448 trial (the RGT) by the same clinical sites collecting matching clinical information and immune 
449 monitoring data provided a standard-of-care benchmark to confidently assess critical safety and 
450 immunological parameters, and also to evaluate whether reduction of immunosuppression through 
451 CBMP application could have potential benefits to patients. Remarkably, in this regard, the rate of 
452 viral infections was considerably lower in patients treated with regulatory cell products compared to 
453 standard-of-care treatment, particularly with regard to viral infections. Furthermore, centralized 
454 immune monitoring of peripheral blood leucocyte populations suggests a return of CBMP-treated 
455 (CTG), but not conventionally-treated (RGT), recipients towards a state of immune homeostasis. 
456 Therefore, results from the ONE Study establish a fundamental basis for further testing of regulatory 
457 cell CBMP therapy in organ transplantation, and provide initial evidence that reducing general 
458 immunosuppressive burden through cell therapy could potentially decrease serious side effects in 
459 KTx recipients. 
460
461 This initial ONE Study report focusses only on the CTG trials as a combined group, and not on results 
462 from the individual CTG trials. While each of the six individual CTG trials followed the same clinical 
463 treatment protocol with regard to background immunosuppression, thus allowing for a 
464 comprehensive analysis of the CTG trials as a whole group, there are important details from each of 
465 those trials that deserve in-depth reporting and explanations in additional follow-up publications. 

19
466 Indeed, forthcoming details from the individual cases will provide insight into interesting feasibility, 
467 safety aspects and effects of each specific cell therapy product, permitting examination of issues such 
468 as cell production methods, CBMP characterization, cell dosing, infusion scheduling, clinical 
469 outcomes and immunological features from KTx biopsy specimens, as well as a comprehensive set of 
470 central immune monitoring results. Nonetheless, the current analysis of results from the combined 
471 CTG trials provides a uniquely broad evaluation of safety and outlook perspective for cell therapy in 
472 organ transplantation, and shows that cell therapy was feasible in terms of logistics and cell 
473 manufacturing in the majority (38/52: 73%) of patients ready to receive the therapy.
474
475 One of the main motivations for seeking new therapies in organ transplantation is to reduce the 
476 need for general immunosuppressive drugs, which have substantial toxicities and incrementally 
477 expose recipients to dangers inherent from a suppressed immune system, most commonly 
infections. A recent set of guidelines and comprehensive review by Fishman17 478 highlights the extent of 
479 the infection problem, and its direct relationship to immunosuppressive load. Results from the ONE 
480 Study CTG trials indicate that lowering immunosuppression does appear to decrease the risk for viral 
481 infections. This was also supported by the immune monitoring results, as only RGT patients showed a 
482 tendency towards increased proportions of CMV-specific memory T cells correlating with signs of 
chronic CD8+ T cell activation at the end of the observation period, as previously described. 483 18-20 What 
484 remains unknown at this point is whether decreased infections were simply due to less 
485 immunosuppression in the CTG trials, or were related in some way to the cell therapy action itself; 
486 neither possibility can be ruled out. It should be noted that immunosuppressive burden was lower 
487 early-on post-KTx (no basiliximab induction) and in some patients after nine months post-KTx (MMF 
488 tapering), but that the infection rates were consistently less across the spectrum of CTG trials during 
489 the entire observation period (Fig. 3C). While reduction of MMF treatment is within the prophylactic 
guidelines for patients at risk for developing viral infection,17 490 the gap in reported infections did not 
491 show evidence of widening between the RGT and CTG trials after nine months, leaving this issue an 

20
492 open question. Nonetheless, our data encourage the performance of prospective randomized clinical 
493 trials to confirm an infectious disease benefit from regulatory cell therapy protocols.
494
495 Our immune monitoring results showed that patients with end-stage renal failure exhibit major 
496 alterations in their peripheral immune cell composition compared to age- and gender-matched 
healthy controls, most likely reflecting their increased inflammatory state.21-23 497 Standard 
498 immunosuppressive therapy in RGT patients did not reverse these alterations, but rather led to 
further immune cell imbalance as evidenced by a significant reduction in markers for stable Tregs.24 499
500 Importantly, regulatory cell therapy mitigated this Treg reduction and correlated with a healthy 
501 control-like restoration of immune cell composition. In particular, MZB numbers, also discussed to 
have anti-inflammatory or regulatory function,25,26 502 were increased in CTG patients at the end of the 
503 observation period. Thus, although both RGT and CTG trial patients had a reduction in donor-specific 
504 IFN-producing memory T cells, only the cell therapy-treated patients tended to experience a re￾505 establishment of immune cell homeostasis, which is a major goal in organ transplantation. 
506 Importantly, these immune-related differences were independent of potential confounding factors 
507 such as donor relationships. Whether this effect is related to cell therapy itself, or is due to reduced 
508 immunosuppressive load in the CTG trials, will need to be investigated further in future trials.
509
510 To date, there are few published reports on the use of regulatory cell therapy in human organ 
511 transplantation, some of which were pilot trials conducted previously by ONE Study investigators 
512 [recently reviewed by Romano 2019]. Hutchinson and colleagues have tested different preparations 
of regulatory macrophages in KTx recipients,27-29 513 which provided critical lessons for designing the 
514 ONE Study CTG trials. Additionally, polyclonal Tregs have been administered by the UCSF group to 
515 three KTx recipients with biopsy-proven subclinical inflammation six months after transplantation, 
showing that cell therapy is feasible in this circumstance;30 516 late administration of expanded 
517 polyclonal Tregs has also been reported by the Northwestern group in nine lymphodepleted KTx 

21
recipients.31 518 In liver transplantation, Todo et al. have infused costimulatory blockade conditioned 
519 lymphocytes similar to those used by the MGH group in the ONE Study, and were able to achieve 
520 complete immunosuppression withdrawal in seven of the ten splenectomized and 
cyclophosphamide-conditioned recipients.32 521 Unfortunately, these pilot studies are highly variable in 
522 design, and did not incorporate a parallel trial with a similar group of patients not receiving cells to 
523 better appraise whether cell therapy is safe or shows indications of discernable effects. Importantly, 
524 the ONE Study trials were developed with the fundamental viewpoint that a reference trial, and also 
525 comparison to healthy control data, is absolutely necessary to make practical conclusions about 
526 regulatory cell therapy testing. Therefore, to advance the cell therapy field in organ transplantation, 
527 we aimed to evaluate cell therapy against a recognized standard-of-care (RGT) treatment by infusing 
528 different CBMPs near the time of KTx as a replacement for conventional induction treatment 
529 (omitting basiliximab induction). Into this design we incorporated an option to wean MMF starting at 
530 nine months to further offer potential benefit to patients from general immunosuppression, and to 
531 stress-test this cell therapy protocol under rigorous clinical monitoring. With this overall study 
532 strategy, and by performing the RGT as a multicenter study together with the CTG trials as parallel 
533 individual trials at the same sites, the ONE Study consortium uniquely delivers meaningful and 
534 reliable information about regulatory cell therapy to the organ transplantation community. Based on 
535 the ONE Study, the UK group has already initiated a randomized trial called the TWO Study with their 
536 polyclonal Treg cell product (ISRCTN11038572), and other ONE Study partners (Massachusetts 
537 General Hospital: NCT03577431 and UCSF Medical Center: NCT02188719) are conducting trials in 
538 transplant recipients with cell products used in the ONE Study. Opening the way to these and other 
539 more advanced clinical trials was the unifying philosophy of the ONE Study.

Supplementary methods
Flow cytometry
Measurements were done locally at each study site upon training by central immune monitoring lab personnel and interlab 
comparisons. Blood samples collected into EDTA tubes were stained within 4 hours and analysed by flow cytometry using the 
previously published antibody panels and protocols (Kverneland Cytometry A 2016). Briefly, 100 µl EDTA blood were directly 
stained with prepared panel antibody mixes and incubated before lysing erythrocytes with lyse-fix solution composed of Versa 
Lyse™ and IOTest® Fixative Solution (Beckman Coulter GmbH). For the B cell panel (panel 4) 300 µl EDTA blood was first 
lysed with Red Blood Cell Lysis Solution (Miltenyi Biotec GmbH) prior to antibody staining. The dendritic cell panel was 
prepared twice and combined after staining. Samples were measured on a 10 colour Navios flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter). 
Calibration with “Flow-Set Pro Beads” and “Flow Check Pro Beads” (both Beckman Coulter) was performed daily. Acquired 
LMD files were centrally analysed by central immune monitoring lab personnel. Analysis of LMD files was done with Kaluza 
version 1.2 (Beckman Coulter). To calculate absolute cell numbers of all reported immune cell subsets, leucocyte cell count was 
obtained from the local clinical chemistry and related to the CD45+ count within each panel. The corresponding proportions of 
all reported immune cell subsets were calculated in Excel.
Real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR and TSDR-demethylation analysis
Patient blood samples were collected in Tempus Blood RNA Tubes (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Schwerte, Germany) and stored 
at -20°C until shipment as batches into central immune monitoring lab. RNA was isolated using the MagMAX™ for Stabilized 
Blood Tubes RNA Isolation Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Up to 1000 ng RNA was transcribed into cDNA using the QuantiTect 
Reverse Transcription Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Hypothesis-driven expression of genes whose expression have been 
previously shown to be increased in samples from immunosuppression-free operationally-tolerant kidney transplant patients, 
such as HS3ST1, SH2D1B, CD79B, MS4A1, PNOC, TCL1A, FCRL1 and FCRL2, or in patients with rejection, such as HMMR, 
TLR5, SLC8A1 and VAV3 (Sagoo et al., J Clin Invest 2010, PMID: 20501943; Sawitzki et al., Am J Transpl 2007, PMID: 
17456197; Viklicky et al., Transplantation 2013, PMID: 23222918; and Krepsova et al., BMC Nephrol 2015, PMID: 26286066) 
was measured using TaqMan Gene Expression Assays (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Hypoxanthine-guanine 
phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) = Hs02800695_m1, beta-2-microglobulin (B2M) = Hs00984230_m1, glyceraldehyde 3-

CD274 = Hs01125301_m1, CD79B = Hs00236881_m1, membrane spanning 4-domains A1 (MS4A1) = Hs00544818_m1, 
prepronociceptin (PNOC) = Hs00918595_m1, T cell leukemia/lymphoma 1A (TCL1A) = Hs00172040_m1, Fc receptor like 1 
(FCRL1) = Hs00957541_m1, Fc receptor like 2 (FCRL2) = Hs00229156_m1), microfluidic cards and TaqMan Universal Master 
Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific) on the ViiA7 Real Time PCR System (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Reactions were run in 
duplicates using 384-well microfluidic Custom TaqMan® Array Cards and obtained data were analyzed applying the respective 
ViiA7 Software v 1.2.2. Gene expression was calculated relative to median expression of three reference genes (HPRT, B2M, 
GAPDH) using the 2-ΔΔCt method.
TSDR Analysis was done centrally at the central immune monitoring lab in batches upon shipment of frozen EDTA blood 
samples. 
First, genomic DNA was isolated from EDTA blood using the QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen). Up to 2 µg DNA were used 
for bisulfite treatment (EpiTect, Qiagen). Real-time PCR was done in a final reaction volume of 20 µl with 10 µl FastStart 
Universal Probe Master (ROX, Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany), 100 ng Lamda DNA (NEB, Frankfurt a.M., 
Germany), 5 pmol methylation or non-methylation specific probe, 30 pmol methylation or non-methylation specific primers and 
at least 15 ng bisulfite-treated DNA or plasmid standard (all Epiontis GmbH, Berlin, Germany). Samples were analyzed in 
triplicates on an ABI 7500 Cycler (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The percentage of CD4+ T cells with demethylated TSDR was 
calculated by division of non-methylated by total genomic FoxP3 copy-number and normalization to the proportion of total 
CD3+CD4+ T cells as determined by flow cytometry.
IFNg EliSpot
Local immune monitoring labs performed isolation and cryopreservation of donor and recipient peripheral blood mononuclear 
cells (PBMCs). For donor PBMCs isolation RosetteSep Human CD3 Depletion Cocktail (Stemcell) was added to collected citrate 
blood prior to Ficoll (Ficoll-Paque Plus, GE Healthcare Life Sciences) gradient centrifugation to remove T cells. 
EliSpot analyses were done centrally by central immune monitoring lab. Stimulation (24h) was done using the EliSpot Interferon￾gamma Assay Kit (AID, Strassberg, Germany). For anti-donor responses 3x105 recipient PBMCs were stimulated with 3x105 T 
cell-depleted PBMCs in triplicates. Anti-CMV were quantified upon stimulation of 3x105 recipient PBMCs with a CMV pp65 
peptide pool (1.25µg/ml; Jerini peptide Technologies, Berlin, Germany) in duplicates. Unstimulated PBMCs served as controls.

after first dose of any study drug (i.e. basiliximab, prednisolone, MMF or tacrolimus in RGT; cell therapy, prednisolone, MMF or tacrolimus in 
CTG). All events coded to the MedDRA PT: “transplant rejections” are excluded, since rejection was measured as the primary efficacy 
endpoint. Incidence rates are expressed as “Events per 100-PSY” and use the cohort-specific cumulative patient-time observed in the RGT 
(72.34) and CTG (43.87) as denominator. * Relationship to immunosuppression was assessed by the reporting Investigator and defined as a 
reasonable possibility of a causal relationship to any of the study drugs. RGT = Reference Group Trial; CTG = Cell Therapy Group trials; PSY 
= patient study years.

Fig. S3: Immunosuppressive burden of tacrolimus and mycophenolate over time. Mean (S3A) and median (S3B)
blood trough levels of tacrolimus calculated at 10 time points using all available readings within the following time
windows: day 0 (± 1 day), 7 (± 1), 14 (± 1), week 4 (± 1 week), 8 (± 1), 12 (± 1), 24 (± 1), 36 (± 1), 48 (± 1) and 60 (± 1);
total number of data points = 771 (RGT) and 496 (CTG). Mean (S3C) and median (S3D) daily doses of mycophenolate
calculated continuously from one week pre-transplantation to 60 weeks post-transplantation. Doses of mycophenolate
sodium converted to biologically equivalent doses of mycophenolate mofetil. Patients switched to azathioprine were
censored at the time of last dose of mycophenolate; if mycophenolate was discontinued permanently or temporarily
without switching to an alternative anti-proliferative agent, the dose was set to zero for the period during which
mycophenolate was withheld. Incomplete or unknown start / stop dates were imputed to the mid-point of two sequential
doses (if in the middle of a dosing regimen) or to the protocol-specified start date (for the very first dose). RGT =
Reference Group Trial (N=66); CTG = Cell Therapy Group trials (N=38); MMF = mycophenolate mofetil.

A) Anti-donor IFNg EliSpot analysis prior to transplantation (V01) and 12 months post-transplantation (V09) of PBMCs 
from RGT (n=45) and CTG (n=33) patients. B) Anti-CMV (pp65) IFNg EliSpot analysis prior to transplantation (V01) 
and 12 months post-transplantation (V09) of PBMCs from RGT (n=45) and CTG (n=33) patients. C) Correlation between 
anti-CMV (pp65) Elispot spot counts and absolute numbers of CD8+ TEMRA (CD8+CD45RA+CCR7- T cells) at 12 months 
post-transplantation (V09). Statistical analysis by Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test and Spearman’s correlation.

(HS3ST1, SH2D1B, CD79B, MS4A1, PNOC, TCL1A, FCRL1, FCRL2) and rejection-associated (HMMR, TLR5, 
SLC8A1, VAV3 ) genes as well as FOXP3 and co-inhibitory molecules (CD200, LAG3, CD274) measured by qRT-PCR 
of whole blood samples from RGT patients (n=66, arm R, white bars) and CTG patients (n=38, arm C, black bars) 
collected pre-transplant (V01), two weeks post-transplant (V03) or 60 weeks post-transplant (V10). Statistical analysis 
was done by Kruskal-Wallis-Test.
