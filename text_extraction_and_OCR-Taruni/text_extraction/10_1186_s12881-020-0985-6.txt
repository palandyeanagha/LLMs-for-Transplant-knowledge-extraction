Abstract
Background: Wolcott-Rallison Syndrome (WRS) is a rare autosomal recessive disease that is the most common
cause of neonatal diabetes in consanguineous families. WRS is caused by various genetic alterations of the
Eukaryotic Translation Initiation Factor 2-Alpha Kinase 3 (EIF2AK3) gene.
Methods: Genetic analysis of a consanguineous family where two children were diagnosed with WRS was
performed by Sanger sequencing. The altered protein was investigated by in vitro cloning, expression and
immunohistochemistry.
Results: The first cases in Hungary, − two patients in one family, where the parents were fourth-degree cousins -
showed the typical clinical features of WRS: early onset diabetes mellitus with hyperglycemia, growth retardation,
infection-induced multiple organ failure. The genetic background of the disease was a novel alteration in the
EIF2AK3 gene involving the splice site of exon 11– intron 11–12 boundary: g.53051_53062delinsTG. According to
cDNA sequencing this created a new splice site and resulted in a frameshift and the development of an early
termination codon at amino acid position 633 (p.Pro627AspfsTer7). Based on in vitro cloning and expression
studies, the truncated protein was functionally inactive. Immunohistochemistry revealed that the intact protein was
absent in the islets of pancreas, furthermore insulin expressing cells were also dramatically diminished. Elevated
GRP78 and reduced CHOP protein expression were observed in the liver.
Conclusions: The novel genetic alteration causing the absence of the EIF2AK3 protein resulted in insufficient
handling of severe endoplasmic reticulum stress, leading to liver failure and demise of the patients.

Background
Wolcott-Rallison syndrome (WRS, OMIM 226980) is a
rare autosomal recessive disorder, first described in 1972
[1]. The leading clinical symptom of the disease is persist￾ent neonatal diabetes mellitus that requires insulin treat￾ment. Diabetes develops typically not later than 6 months
after birth, but delayed cases have been also described [1–
5]. The poor prognosis of WRS is associated with liver
failure triggered by endoplasmic reticulum stressors like
viral-, bacterial infections, and hypoglycemia; later the
outcome is determined by the possible complications of
insulin therapy and hepatic injury. The cause of death is
multiorgan failure, liver and kidney insufficiency. The
broad diversity of the clinical manifestation of WRS con￾sists of spondylo-epiphyseal dysplasia resulting in growth
retardation and short stature [1–6]. Developmental delay,
osteoporosis, anemia and neutropenia are rare manifesta￾tions [1–6]. Only sporadic cases were described with
hypothyreoidism [7], exocrine pancreas insufficiency [8,
9], skin [1] or central nervous system abnormalities
(microcephaly, pachygyria, mental retardation) [10–13].
The genetic base of the disorder is well-characterized;
variants in the Eukaryotic Translation Initiation Factor 2-
Alpha Kinase 3 (EIF2AK3) - or traditionally PKR-like
endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) - are present in all
of the cases [14]. The different forms of the altered gene
may present different levels of gene expressions with vari￾able extent of the protein function. Upon endoplasmic
reticulum (ER) stress EIF2AK3 detects the accumulation
of misfolded proteins in the ER, phosphorylates EIF2α and
downregulates the rate of protein synthesis [15]. EIF2α
phosphorylation results in the expression of CHOP, a
multifaceted transcription factor of ER stress. If the gene
is altered and the EIF2AK3 protein is absent or non￾functional, large amount of misfolded proteins are accu￾mulating in affected cells and tissues. In cases of WRS the
alteration leads to proinsulin aggregation and β cells apop￾tosis in pancreas. Other organs, mainly liver and kidney
also demonstrate the signs of ER stress [16, 17].
Our two presented cases - the first WRS patients in
Hungary - had different longevity, although they were
siblings living in the same environment and treated by
the same medical team. Their parents are fourth-degree
cousins of a family in Hungary with Romani (alias Roma)
ethnicity. The disease was caused by a novel splice site
variant resulting in a non-functional truncated protein,
characterized at the DNA, RNA, and protein level. The
cause of their death was liver damage leading to multior￾gan failure at 4.2 year and 4 month of age. We were able
to document extreme endoplasmic reticulum stress even
in the younger child. Our aim was to provide data on ER
stress in WRS in order to address the hypothesis that ER
stress inhibitors could prove beneficial for patients until
the en bloc liver-pancreas transplantation.
Methods
Patients and controls
The index patient (Patient 1) and her sister (Patient 2)
showed the typical clinical signs and symptoms of Wolcott￾Rallison syndrome and expired due to multiple organ fail￾ure induced by viral infection at 4.2 years and 4 months of
age, respectively. Their parents were fourth-degree cousins.
The parents also have two younger twin sons without any
signs of WRS. Additionally, the mother has two older
daughters and one grand-daughter - from her former rela￾tionship – who are all healthy. Altogether 9 of the described
10 family members were subjected to genetic analyses
(Fig. 1a). The control samples used for immunohistochem￾istry were the routine histological samples of a 43-year-old
female person, who died because of an acute fulminant in￾carceration of truncus cerebri caused by an aneurysm rup￾ture of the arteria communicans anterior. She had no other
diseases based on the autopsy results.
DNA and RNA isolation
Genomic DNA and RNA were isolated from peripheral
blood of the still living Patient 1, living parents, children
and a grandchild, using the QIAmp DNA and RNA Blood
Mini kits (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Since the sister of the
index child died years before the diagnosis, formalin-fixed,
paraffin-embedded liver tissues were used as source of
DNA in her case and the “Tissue protocol” of the QIAmp
DNA mini kit (Qiagen) was applied to extract DNA.
Sequence analysis of the EIF2AK3 gene from DNA and
RNA samples
The coding regions and the exon-intron boundaries of
17 exons of the EIF2AK3 gene were amplified in 18
PCRs. We designed the PCR primers by Primer 3 soft￾ware [18] with the exception of exon 3, where we used a
primer pair reported in a previous publication [17].
RNA isolated from white blood cells of Patient 1 and
her mother was reverse transcribed using the High￾Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Thermo Fisher
Scientific, Waltham, MA USA). We amplified the region
surrounding the observed genetic alteration from cDNA
using a special primer pair designed including sequences
of exon 11 and exon 12. The PCR product was 201 bp.
Since DNA isolated from formalin fixed paraffin￾embedded tissue contains smaller, fragmented DNA,
special PCR reaction was designed surrounding the in￾volved exon-intron boundary of exon 11. The PCR pro￾vided a smaller product (129 bp).
The PCR products were sequenced using a cyclic
chain-termination sequencing reaction with the BigDye
Terminator kit (v.3.1 and v.1.1; Thermo Fisher Scientific)
and the ABI PRISM 310 Genetic Analyzer (Thermo
Fisher Scientific), as described before [19].

conditions are available upon request.
EIF2AK3 kinase domain expression
The cDNAs of the kinase domains (amino acid 536–1116)
of wild type and truncated EIF2AK3 were amplified using
the Phusion Hot Start II Polymerase (Thermo Fisher Scien￾tific). Amplimers were ligated into pTriex4Neo expression
vector (Merck-Millipore) including an N-terminal 6 × His
tag and were transformed into E. coli Rosetta2 pLysS
(Merck-Millipore). Bacteria were cultured in LB Broth with
100 μg/mL ampicillin, induced with 1 mM IPTG. Cells from
an uninduced culture after 5 h of culturing as well 2 and 5 h
after the induction with IPTG were taken and centrifuged.
Western-blot analysis of the EIF2AK3 kinase domain
Pellets of bacteria were lysed in cold lysis buffer and cen￾trifuged. Protein samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE
using 12% Tris-glycine gels and were transferred to PVDF
membranes (BioRad Hungary, Budapest, Hungary). Anti￾His monoclonal antibody (Proteintech, Manchester,
United Kingdom), a peroxidase-conjugated goat anti￾mouse IgG secondary antibody (GE Healthcare, Wauke￾sha, WI, USA) and the SuperSignal West Pico Chemilu￾minescent Substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific) were used
for identification of the expressed proteins.
Immunohistochemical staining
Both the patient and the control tissue samples were fixed
with PBS buffered formaldehyde solution and embedded in
paraffin wax. The slides were then deparaffinated using xylol
and ethanol. Endogenous peroxidase was inactivated (EnVi￾sion™ FLEX Peroxidase-Blocking Reagent; Dako, Glostrup,
Denmark) and heat-induced epitope retrieval was performed
in antigen retrieval buffer solution (RE-7119, Leica, Wetzlar,
Germany) in a pressure cooker. Samples were incubated
with anti-insulin (clone: rabbit polyclonal 5267650001 Roche
Mo. Kft); with anti-PERK (clone: rabbit polyclonal ab79483
- Abcam); with anti-GRP78/BIP (clone: rabbit polyclonal
11587–1-AP - Proteintech Europe); and with anti-CHOP

were subject of the genetic analysis (a). Compared to the wild type sequence (b) Patient 1 was homozygous (c) while the mother (e), father, one
of the brothers and one of the half-sisters were heterozygous carriers of the observed genetic alteration [g.53051_53062delinsTG (Ref Seq:
NG_016424.1)] based on genomic DNA (“gDNA”) sequencing using DNA isolated from peripheral leukocytes. In the case of Patient 2, only
formalin fixed paraffin-embedded tissues were available, therefore, DNA was isolated from these archived liver sections and the region of the
variation was amplified by a special PCR. Sequencing of these amplified fragments proved that Patient 2 was also homozygous for the genetic
alteration present in the family (d). The red boxes show the deleted nucleotides (b) and the inserted “TG” base pair (c,d). Nt: Not tested

primary antibodies. The specimens were then incubated
with EnVision™ Flex+ Rabbit linker, and EnVision™ Flex/
HRP enzyme. Detection of antibody binding was done by in￾cubation with the EnVision™ FLEX/HRP (Dako). Slides were
then reacted with DAB (EnVision™ FLEX DAB+ Chromo￾gen - for insulin and PERK) or with VIP (UltraView Univer￾sal Alkaline Phosphatase Red Detection Kit 760/503–505 -
for CHOP and GRP78) solution. The intensity and distribu￾tion of the staining were assessed by light microscopy (Leica
DM2500 microscope, DFC 420 camera and Leica Applica￾tion Suite V3 software, Leica). The slides were counter￾stained with Gill Hematoxylin solution (105175 Merck
Millipore, Billerica, Massachusetts, USA).
Results
Clinical cases
Patient 1
Patient 1 was a term newborn, with 2700 g birth weight
and 47 cm length. Her mother and father were 28 and
47 years old, respectively, at her birth. This girl was the
first child of this relationship, but the mother had two
healthy daughters from her previous partner (Fig. 1a).
The parents were 4th degree cousins.
The first symptom oral candidiasis, presented at birth,
and severe dermatitis was noted at 2 weeks of age. Medical
assistance was sought only at 4 months of age. Laboratory
tests proved diabetes mellitus with hyperglycemia (23.6
mmol/L), elevated HbA1c (13.7%) and fructosamine
(551 μmol/L). Severe leukopenia (3.52 G/L) and neutro￾penia (0.33 G/L) were also measured. Tests for glutamate
decarboxylase and pancreatic islet cell antibodies were
negative. Thyroid function was mildly affected, documented
with normal sTSH and fT3 but reduced fT4 (10.7 pmol/L).
Growth retardation was noticed at 3.2 years of age, with
a weight of 12.8 kgs (10–25 percentile) and height of 88
cms (3 percentile). X-rays evaluation revealed signs of
spondylo-epiphyseal dysplasia: the epiphyses of the long
bones were wide, the phalangeal and metacarpal bones
were irregular, short, stubby and porotic, the bony islands
below the epiphyseal plates appeared as narrow dots
(Fig. 2). The vertebrae showed normal morphology. Psy￾chomotor development was retarted.
The child suffered multiple infectious episodes. Sepsis and
liver failure developed at 10 months of age with leukopenia
(5.29 G/L) and neutropenia (0.02 G/L). Autoimmune hepa￾titis was ruled out. At 3.9 years of age, another severe epi￾sode of liver failure developed with neutropenia, anemia
and renal insufficiency triggered by herpes simplex virus 1.
The patient died at 4.2 years of age as a consequence of rap￾idly progressive multiorgan – primarily liver – failure.
Patient 2
Patient 2 was the younger daughter of the same couple; she
was born as a growth restricted newborn with 1920 g birth
weight and 43 cm length at 42 weeks of gestational age. She
was diagnosed with diabetes mellitus at the age of 6 weeks.
She died at 4 months of age after rotavirus infection com￾plicated by hepatorenal syndrome and multiorgan failure.
Identification of the genetic alteration in the EIF2AK3
gene
Genomic DNA sequencing
Based on the typical clinical symptoms and complications,
genetic testing for WRS was initiated. Genomic DNA re￾gions of the 17 exons and exon-intron boundaries of the
EIF2AK3 gene were amplified in 18 PCRs and bidirectional
sequencing was performed. The PCR products of exon 11
showed characteristic patterns on the gel electropherogram:
a healthy individual was represented by a 362-bp PCR prod￾uct, in the case of Patient 1 this was 352 bp, while in the
case of the parents both bands were visible. DNA sequen￾cing revealed a 12 bp deletion involving the exon 11 – in￾tron 11–12 boundary (9 bp in the exon, 3 bp in the intron)
combined with the insertion of a “T” and “G” nucleotide:
g.53051_53062delinsTG (Ref Seq: NG_016424.1) (Fig. 1b).
Fig. 2 Characteristic signs of spondylo-epiphyseal dysplasia on chest-humeri and arm X-rays. Hand (a) and Chest-humeri (b) X-rays of Patient 1
are presented. Short and broad metacarpi and phalanges, porotic bones, hypoplastic bony islands of the basal phalanges below the epiphyseal
plates are clearly visible. The epiphyses of the humeri are broadened, the vertebrae have normal morphology
Sümegi et al. BMC Medical Genetics (2020) 21:61 Page 4 of 12

This alteration was present in homozygous form in the child
and in heterozygous form in the parents (Fig. 1c and e).
Since the younger daughter of the couple died because
of very similar symptoms, the presence of the disease was
suspected in her case, too. Because of the early and unex￾pected death of this child only formalin fixed, paraffin￾embedded tissue could serve as DNA source; therefore we
isolated DNA from liver sections of Patient 2. Unfortu￾nately, the PCR for exon 11 applied above did not work;
therefore, a novel PCR method was developed for this re￾gion of the gene providing a much shorter PCR product
(129 bp). Using this PCR, the genetic alteration observed
in Patient 1 and the parents could be identified also in Pa￾tient 2, in homozygous form (Fig. 1d).
Another 5 family members were tested for the presence
of the described alteration. One of the younger twin
brothers of the Patients and one daughter of the mother
coming from her former relation was heterozygous for the
genetic alteration, without any signs of WRS, while the
others were negative (Fig. 1a).
mRNA/cDNA sequencing
Since the identified deletion/insertion described at the
DNA level involved the 3′ splice site of exon 11, its ef￾fect on transcription, protein sequence and expression
was revealed by sequencing the cDNA of Patient 1. Spe￾cial primer pair was designed involving sequences of
exon 11 and exon 12, and the relevant fragment was
amplified using the cDNA of Patient 1 as template. Se￾quencing of this PCR product revealed that the observed
deletion/insertion destroyed the former splice site and a
new one was created (gg∣gtaaa) in the intron by 58 bp
away from the original exon-intron border in the 3′ dir￾ection (Fig. 3a). The altered splicing resulted in a 55-bp
Fig. 3 Consequence of the genetic alteration at the mRNA level determined by cDNA sequencing in the case of Patient 1. The cDNA of Patient 1
was also sequenced showing that the genetic alteration caused the development of a novel splice site. On a the genomic DNA (“gDNA”) of
Patient 1 shows the location of the 12-bp-deletion, “TG” insertion (red box) and the place of the novel splice sequence (blue box) in the intronic
part. On b the cDNA sequence of the patient presents the shortened exon 11, the intact exon 12, the inserted “TG” (red box) and the 55 bp
intronic nucleotides, furthermore the stop codon (TAA, black box) resulted due to the frameshift in the reading frame. Translation of the altered
mRNA might produce a truncated protein with 6 altered amino acids (position 627–632: DGWYLG) and a premature STOP codon at position 633
(b and c)
Sümegi et al. BMC Medical Genetics (2020) 21:61 Page 5 of 12

insertion of the intronic sequence into the mRNA of
EIF2AK3 (Fig. 3b). The result of this genetic alteration
was a frameshift ending-up in a termination codon
(TAA). The amino acid sequence was normal up to pos￾ition 626 followed by 6 altered amino acids (DGWYLG) in
the altered protein, and the position of the truncation was
at amino acid 633 (p.Pro627AspfsTer7) (Fig. 3b and c).
Consequences of the EIF2AK3 gene variation at the
protein level
Cloning and in vitro expression of the truncated EIF2AK3
protein
cDNAs of a healthy control and Patient 1 spanning the
cytoplasmic domain (amino acid 537–1116) of wild type
and truncated EIF2AK3 were cloned and expressed in E.
coli Rosetta2 pLysS. Cells from an uninduced culture after
5 h of culturing, and cells 2 and 5 h after induction with
IPTG were centrifuged and lysed. The wild-type and trun￾cated EIF2AK3 proteins were detected by Western￾blotting. Two hours after the induction, the kinase domain
of the wild-type protein was expressed as a 72 kDa and a
100 kDa protein, while after 5 h only the 100 kDa form was
visible (Fig. 4b). The larger form represents the autopho￾sphorylated EIF2AK3 protein referring to the wild type
gene expression. In contrast, the cDNA reverse transcribed
from the altered mRNA coded a truncated EIF2AK3 pro￾tein with a molecular weight of 17.5 kDa with no signs of
phosphorylation, demonstrating that the genetic alteration
resulted in a functionally inactive protein (Fig. 4d).
Expression of insulin and EIF2AK3 protein in the pancreatic
tissue of Patient 2
In order to further characterize the expression of
EIF2AK3 protein, immunohistochemical analysis of post
mortem pancreatic tissue of Patient 2, the younger sister,
was performed. The hematoxylin-eosin staining showed
histological features of severe tissue damage with fibro￾sclerotic scars. The parenchyma of the exocrine pancreas
and the pancreatic ducts were atrophic, dissected by
thick connective tissue branches in a spider web-like
fashion compared to normal. The endocrine parenchyma
was also atrophic; the diameter of Langerhans islands
was small compared to control (Fig. 5a-d). The lack of β
cells can be demonstrated by anti-insulin antibody based
immunohistological staining. While the cells of the
Langerhans islands in the control were positive for insu￾lin with 50 to 80%, only less than 10% of the cells were
stained for insulin in our child (Fig. 5e and f). The total
absence of the intact EIF2AK3 protein was documented
in the Langerhans islands of Patient 2 upon comparison
with a highly positive normal sample (Fig. 5g and h). We
conclude that the alteration of EIF2AK3 protein in our
WRS patient resulted in not only the defect of the PERK
arm of ER stress and β cell injury, but also the severe
damage and remodeling of the whole pancreas.
Fig. 4 Cloning and in vitro expression of the truncated EIF2AK3 protein. a and c shows that the cDNA of the kinase domain of the wild-type and
altered protein was cloned and expressed using the pTriex4Neo expression vector and the E. coli Rosetta2 pLysS bacteria. The transfected
microbes were cultured and induced with 1 mM IPTG for 0, 2 and 5 h and after that were centrifuged and lysed. The wild type and truncated
EIF2AK3 protein was detected by Western-blotting using His-tag specific antibodies, a peroxidase-labeled conjugate and a chemiluminescent
substrate (b and d). The wild type protein was expressed in the bacteria partly as a 72 kDa and partly as a 100 kDa protein after 2 h of induction,
while after 5 h only the 100 kDa form was visible. The larger form represents the autophosphorylated EIF2AK3 molecule (b). In contrast, − as it is
presented on d - the cDNA reverse transcribed from the variant mRNA coded a truncated EIF2AK3 protein with a molecular weight of 17.5 kDa
and no signs of phosphorylation could be observed

Altered expression of CHOP and GRP78 in the liver of
Patient 2 showed the presence of severe endoplasmic
reticulum stress
The hematoxylin-eosin staining also showed histological fea￾tures of severe liver damage. The basic lobular structure was
discohesive, most of the hepatocytes contained microvesicu￾lar lipid droplets and intracytoplasmic bile vesicles. Hepato￾cytes contained Councilman-body and Mallory-hyaline and
their nuclear positivity disappeared at the edge of lobules,
moreover the cytoplasm was homogenous and acidophilic.
The portal region demonstrated sclerotic degeneration with
massive lymphocyte accumulation (Fig. 6a-d).
Importantly, tremendous expression with intensive dif￾fuse cytoplasmic positivity of the ER chaperon, GRP78
was observed in the hepatocytes of our WRS patient, while
the control liver showed only light positivity (Fig. 6g and
Fig. 5 Expression of insulin and EIF2AK3 proteins in pancreas of the Patient 2 with Wolcott-Rallison syndrome and a healthy control. 1st and 2nd
row (a, b, c, d): H&E staining with different magnifications. 3rd row (e, f): Insulin immunohistological staining (chromophore: DAB - brown). 4th
row (g, h): immunohistological staining by anti-EIF2AK3 antibody in Wolcott-Rallison syndrome and a control sample (chromophore: DAB -
brown). The WRS samples present severe tissue injury with fibrotic remodeling with negative insulin staining in the Langerhans islands
accompanied with negative EIF2AK3 protein expression. Control pancreas presents no tissue injury, and positive insulin-EIF2Ak3 immunoreactivity

h). CHOP expression presented an opposite pattern.
CHOP staining was negative in case of the patient, while
light, granular positivity was detected in the hepatocytes
of the control sample (Fig. 6e and f). We may summarize
the pathological changes of the liver of our WRS patients
as an example of the imbalance of cytoprotective chaperon
and the damaging continuous ER stress.
Discussion
Two children of a family with consanguineous parents,
who carried a novel genetic alteration in the EIF2AK3 gene
(g.53051_53062delinsTG, Ref Seq: NG_016424.1; c.1878_
1886 + 3delinsTG, Ref.Seq: NM_004836.7), showed the
typical clinical scenario of Wolcott-Rallison syndrome,
while one of their brothers, a half-sister and the parents of

patient. The protective ER chaperon, GRP78 expressed tremendously accompanied with no CHOP expression in Patient 2. Control liver presents
no tissue injury, extremely low GRP78 expression and a light immunostaining for CHOP

the patients were heterozygous carriers of the variant
without any signs of the disorder. Both affected children
had insulin-dependent neonatal diabetes mellitus with se￾vere growth retardation, failure to thrive, anemia and neu￾tropenia. In Patient 1, spondylo-epiphyseal dysplasia and
slight hypothyroidism were also observed. Recurrent in￾fections dominated the clinical picture in Patient 1, and in
both children viral infection culminated in acute liver and
kidney failure.
Based on the data of the Human Gene Mutation Data￾base (HGMD), 88 different genetic alterations have been
described in the EIF2AK3 gene (Fig. 7) (HGMD® home
page: www.hgmd.cf.ac.uk [20]) and majority of the cases
(n = 52) represent single nucleotide substitutions (Fig. 7a),
of which 24 result in STOP codon (nonsense variants) and
28 in amino acid change (missense variants). Beside the
single nucleotide changes, 18 small deletions, 7 small in￾sertions, 1 small indel (Fig. 7b), 1 complex rearrangement
and 3 gross deletions are known to alter the sequence of
the EIF2AK3 gene. The distribution of the different
genetic alterations along the EIF2AK3 gene shows clear
differences. Variants with pathologic phenotype, ending￾up in an early STOP codon and a truncated protein, can
be located in any exon, while missense variants are present
dominantly in the kinase domain of the gene (exons 11 to
17) (Fig. 7a). Similarly, small insertions/deletions and
splice site variants resulting in a frameshift and early ter￾mination of protein synthesis can be present in any exon
(Fig. 7b). Regarding the genotype-phenotype association,
there is hardly any correlation between the genotypes and
the clinical scenario of WRS based on literature data. Even
the same genetic alteration can be associated with differ￾ent clinical signs and symptoms in separate individuals.
Only the genetic variants located in the very end of the
EIF2AK3 gene or single nucleotide substitutions (missense
variants) in the 1st kinase domain can be associated with
somewhat milder phenotype - longer overall survival or
later onset of the disease -, most probably due to the slight
remnant kinase activity of the altered/truncated protein
[2, 3, 5, 9, 21].

alterations. The variant described in this study is presented in purple (b)
Sümegi et al. BMC Medical Genetics (2020) 21:61 Page 9 of 12

In the background of WRS, 6 splice variants are described
among the total of 88 genetic alterations. All of these WRS
variants involve the most conserved nucleotides of the splice
sites; the “GT” intronic sequence at the donor and the “AG”
intronic base pair at the acceptor site: c.1650 + 2 T > A [3], c,
1764 - 2A > G [22], c.1887 - 1G > C [23], c.2985 + 1G > A
[17], c.3150 + 1G > T [24], and c.2985 + 1dupG [21]. The
consequence of these splice site alterations represents exon
skipping, less frequently the activation of a cryptic intra￾exonic donor or acceptor splice site, or extremely rarely, the
development of an intronic splice site resulting in aberrant
inclusions of intronic parts as cryptic exons [25]. The trans￾lated protein may vary dramatically depending on the mature
mRNA. The whole protein might be synthetized with some
additional amino acids coded by the inserted intronic se￾quences or lacking some deleted exonic elements, or the
whole protein might be intact excluding the skipped exon. If
the alternative splicing creates a frameshift and/or an early
STOP codon [25–28] there is a high chance for the develop￾ment of a non-functional protein. The splice site alterations,
the consequences of a DNA change, have to be evaluated at
least at RNA level by RNA/cDNA sequencing or at protein
level using different expression systems [25, 26, 28].
Intriguingly, the splice site variants described in the
EIF2AK3 gene have not been tested at RNA and protein
level by far, most probably because they involved the most
conserved nucleotides of splicing, and most probably these
were the disease causing genetic alterations [3, 17, 21, 23,
24]. The novel variant described in our work is unique and
has not been described previously in this gene. In vitro ex￾pression of the altered kinase domain’s cDNA revealed that
the truncated protein was not autophosphorylated result￾ing in an inactive protein. Immunohistochemical analysis
of the pancreatic tissue of Patient 2 showed the lack of ex￾pression of the intact EIF2AK3 protein.
The major function of EIF2AK3 is to detect the accumu￾lation of misfolded proteins in the ER, and - via phosphor￾ylation of EIF2α - to reduce the rate of protein synthesis
[15]. If the EIF2AK3 gene is altered and the protein is not
functional, the control of protein synthesis is lost, resulting
in large amount of misfolded, aggregated proteins [16, 17].
Our results support this phenomenon, since the insulin
staining in the pancreatic islet cells was diminished in the
younger sibling together with the missing EIF2AK3 protein
compared to a healthy sample where the normal expres￾sion of EIF2AK3 went along with normal insulin content
in the β cells. This diminished insulin staining can be ex￾plained by the possible presence of insulin aggregates that
might be less reactive to our anti-insulin antibody, or by
the injury of insulin expressing beta cells due to their apop￾tosis induced by the overload of unfolded proteins.
The liver is the main target of ER stress. The activa￾tion of EIF2AK3 is an important pathway of ER stress.
EIF2AK3 activation can be protective by reducing the
misfolded protein load in the ER, but also can induce
apoptosis by the CHOP dependent way [29]. Similarly to
EIF2AK3, inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1) - the sec￾ond arm of ER stress – can initiate the synthesis of pro￾tective chaperon proteins, but also may lead to apoptosis
mediated by the apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1/c￾Jun N-terminal kinase (ASK1-JNK) pathway [30]. Finally,
the third pathway, the activating transcription factor-6
(ATF6), stimulates the expression of protective chaperon
proteins like GRP78 (glucose-regulated protein, 78 kDa)
[31]. This was the case in our study. The insufficiency of
the first arm of ER stress (the PERK pathway) resulted in
the activation of the third one, ATF6 arm leading to
GRP78 induction in the liver. Upregulation of GRP78 to￾gether with the absence of CHOP expression in the
post-mortem liver sections of the WRS patient proved
the diminished activity of the EIF2AK3 pathway. Signs
of severe tissue damage and fibrotic reaction were visible
on the HE staining, showing the presence of the con￾tinuous liver destruction.
Our data further support the importance of the genetic
testing of the EIF2AK3 gene in children with early onset
diabetes who are born in consanguineous families. The
early diagnosis of WRS can help the initiation of appro￾priate intervention therapy. The characteristics of our
cases may allow us to hypothesize on a novel therapeutic
approach; the introduction of ER stress inhibitors to
delay combined en bloc liver-pancreas transplantation in
WRS patients.
Conclusions
The first WRS cases in Hungary are caused by a unique,
novel indel variant involving the splice site of exon
11 – intron 11–12 boundary (g.53051_53062delinsTG,
c.1878_1886 + 3delinsTG) resulting in the development of
a new splice site. Due to the altered splicing, 55 nucleotides
of intron 11–12 are inserted to the transcribed mRNA.
The combination of these genetic events resulted in a
frameshift and the development of an early termination
codon at amino acid position 633 (p.Pro627AspfsTer7).
The truncated protein is functionally inactive based on
in vitro cloning and expression studies. In our WRS
patient, intact EIF2AK3 was absent in the pancreatic islet
ex vivo. The upregulation of GRP78 in the post-mortem
liver sections of the WRS patient indicated an ongoing
ER stress. The lack of the activity of the EIF2AK3 was
associated with a unique liver histology characterized by
diminished CHOP expression and severe liver injury.
