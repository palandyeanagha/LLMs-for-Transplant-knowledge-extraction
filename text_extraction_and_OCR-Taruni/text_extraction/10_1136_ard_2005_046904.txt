Abstract
Objective: To examine the prevalence and characteristics of
patients with reactive haemophagocytic syndrome (RHS)
complicating adult-onset Still’s disease (AOSD).


Methods: Of 50 patients with AOSD fulfilling Yamaguchi and
Fautrel criteria followed in our department, clinical and laboratory
data, course and treatment of six patients with histologically proven
RHS and without any obvious cause other than AOSD were
retrospectively recorded.
Results: RHS led to AOSD in two cases, whereas it appeared after a
mean duration of 3.5 years from onset of AOSD in the other cases.
The main symptoms were fever (n = 6), polyarthralgias or myalgias
(n = 4), lymphadenopathy or splenomegaly (n = 3), pharyngitis (n 
= 3), rash (n = 3), pleuritis (n = 3), hepatomegaly (n = 1), normal
or low leucocyte count (n = 4), anaemia (n = 6), lymphocytopenia
(n = 6), thrombocytopenia (n = 4), hyperbasophilic lymphocytes (n 
= 2), abnormal liver function tests (n = 6) and increased serum
triglyceride level (n = 6). Serum ferritin concentration was
constantly increased (>10 000 µg/l in five cases, with <5–35% in
glycosylated form). Two patients presented with coagulopathy.
Treatment comprised corticosteroids (n = 4) and intravenous
immunoglobulins (n = 3), whereas prednisone was unchanged in
one case. One death due to pneumonia occurred 15 days after RHS.
With a follow-up ranging from 2 to 7.5 years, the other patients
were in remission with prednisone plus etanercept (n = 1),
prednisone plus methotrexate (n = 1), low-dose prednisone (n = 2)
or without treatment (n = 1).
Conclusion: RHS is not uncommon in AOSD. It should be evoked in
a patient with AOSD in the absence of hyperleucocytosis,
thrombocytopenia, lymphopenia and coagulopathy, or in the
presence of high serum ferritin and triglyceride levels.
