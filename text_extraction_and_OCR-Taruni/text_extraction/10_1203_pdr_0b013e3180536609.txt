Abstract
Congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is a leading cause of
sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) in children. Whether connexin
mutations are factors in the development of CMV-related hearing
loss has not been explored. We examined gap junction protein
beta-2 (GJB2) and gap junction protein beta-6 (GJB6) mutations in
149 children with congenital CMV infection and 380 uninfected
neonates. Mutations in GJB2 and GJB6 were assessed by nucleotide
sequencing and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods,
respectively. The study population was predominantly African
American, and 4.3% of the subjects were carriers of a connexin 26
mutation. The overall frequency of GJB2 mutations was
significantly higher in the group of children with CMV infection and


hearing loss (21%) compared with those with CMV infection and
normal hearing (3%, p = 0.017) and the group of uninfected
newborns (3.9%, p = 0.016). Eight previously reported mutations
(M34T, V27I, R127H, F83L, R143W, V37I, V84L, G160S), and four
novel mutations (V167M, G4D, A40T, and R160Q) were detected.
None of the study children had the 342-kb deletion (delGJB6-
D13S1830) in GJB6, which suggests that this mutation does not
play a role in hereditary deafness in the African American
population. Although GJB2 mutations were detected in children
with and without CMV-related hearing loss, those with hearing loss
had a higher frequency of GJB2 mutations.
