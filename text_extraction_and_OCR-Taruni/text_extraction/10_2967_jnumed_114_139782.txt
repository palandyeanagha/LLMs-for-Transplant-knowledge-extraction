Absolute myocardial blood flow (MBF) and myocardial flow reserve
(MFR) provide incremental diagnostic and prognostic information
over relative perfusion alone. Recent development of dedicated
cardiac SPECT cameras with better sensitivity and temporal
resolution make dynamic SPECT imaging more practical. In this
study, we evaluate the measurement of MBF using a multipinhole
dedicated cardiac SPECT camera in a pig model of rest and
transient occlusion at stress using 3 common tracers: 201Tl, 99mTc-tetrofosmin, and 99mTc-sestamibi. Methods: Animals (n 5
19) were injected at rest/stress with 99mTc radiotracers (370/1,100
MBq) or 201Tl (37/110 MBq) with a 1-h delay between rest and
dipyridamole stress. With each tracer, microspheres were injected
simultaneously as the gold standard measurement for MBF. Dy￾namic images were obtained for 11 min starting with each injection.
Residual resting activity was subtracted from stress data and
images reconstructed with CT-based attenuation correction and
energy window–based scatter correction. Dynamic images were pro￾cessed with kinetic analysis software using a 1-tissue-compartment
model to obtain the uptake rate constant K1 as a function of micro￾sphere MBF. Results: Measured extraction fractions agree with
those obtained previously using ex vivo techniques. Converting K1
back to MBF using the measured extraction fractions produced ac￾curate values and good correlations with microsphere MBF: r 5
0.75–0.90 (P , 0.01 for all). The correlation in the MFR was between
r 5 0.57 and 0.94 (P , 0.01). Conclusion: Noninvasive measurement
of absolute MBF with stationary dedicated cardiac SPECT is feasible
using common perfusion tracers.

Studies using PET have demonstrated that absolute myocardial
blood flow (MBF) and myocardial flow reserve (MFR 5 stress/
rest MBF) provide incremental diagnostic and prognostic infor￾mation over relative perfusion alone (1–4). Imaging of myocardial
perfusion is much more commonly performed with SPECT than
with PET, but MBF measurements are not typically acquired.
Measuring MBF is difficult with standard SPECT cameras be￾cause of the need for attenuation and scatter correction and the
need to rotate around the patient for 3-dimensional imaging. Re￾cent studies have shown that it is possible to obtain an index of the
MFR without a direct measure of MBF using a combination of
dynamic planar followed by static SPECT acquisitions (5) and that
this can provide some prognostic information (6). Other studies
have demonstrated that rapid camera rotation can provide dynamic
tomographic data and hence a measure of MFR (7) and the arterial
input function (8), suggesting that accurate measures of MBF could
be possible (9). The practicality of measuring MBF has increased
greatly, however, with the advent of dedicated cardiac cameras.
Dedicated cardiac cameras such as the DSPECT system
(Spectrum Dynamics Medical Inc.) or the Discovery NM 530c/
570c cameras (GE Healthcare) have greatly improved sensitivity
and do not rotate around the patient (10). These features allow
dynamic imaging with high temporal resolution that is supported
by improved count density and raises the possibility of clinically
practical MBF measurement with SPECT. Recent work measured
an index of global MFR (11), but no studies have measured MBF.
Studies have focused on the use of 99mTc-sestamibi and 99mTc￾tetrofosmin as they are more common and data from these tracers
have much higher count statistics than 201Tl. However, both 99mTc
tracers have low extraction fractions (EFs) at high flow rates,
limiting the apparent increase in MBF between rest and stress.
201Tl has a better EF but the high dosimetry of the tracer leads
to increased image noise and reduced image quality. Thus, it is
unclear which tracer would provide the most accurate MBF.
In this study, we evaluate the measurement of absolute MBF
using a multipinhole cardiac SPECT camera in a pig model of rest
followed by transient occlusion at stress using a clinically feasible
acquisition protocol and clinically appropriate doses of 3 common
tracers: 201Tl, 99mTc-tetrofosmin, and 99mTc-sestamibi.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
A pig model of transient occlusion of the left anterior descending
(LAD) coronary artery at stress similar to Nekolla et al. (12) was used
to produce a broad range of flow with regional variation. Farm-bred
Yorkshire-cross female pigs (30–40 kg) were anesthetized with tilet￾amine, zolazepam (Fort Dodge), and xylazine (Bayer) and maintained
using 2%–3% isoflurane. A thoracotomy was performed and a suture
loop placed around the LAD just below the second diagonal branch.
Suture lines were brought out of the chest, allowing occlusion and
release during imaging. For the normal animals, the same surgery was
performed but the suture loop was not placed. The number of occluded
and normal pigs that completed the protocol was, respectively, 6 and 4
(201Tl), 4 and 5 (99mTc-tetrofosmin), and 3 and 1 (99mTc-sestamibi).
Of these, we excluded 4 studies because the average microsphere

results in the nonoccluded heart regions were more than 2.3 SDs (13)
away from the mean values normally seen with this pig model, as
assessed with a separate cohort of 21 animals. The range of micro￾sphere values accepted for rest MBF, stress MBF, and MFR were 0.2–
1.7 mL/min/g, 1.5–4.1 mL/min/g, and 1.1–5.1, respectively. The excluded
studies were 1 occluded 99mTc-tetrofosmin study, 1 normal 201Tc study,
and 2 occluded 201Tl studies. The study was performed with the approval
of the University of Ottawa Animal Care Ethics Committee in accor￾dance with the guidelines of the Canadian Council on Animal Care.
Images were acquired on a Discovery NM 530c (GE Healthcare)
camera; additional details are in the Supplemental Methods (avail￾able at http://jnm.snmjournals.org) (14). For all tracers, acquisition
mimicked a 1-d rest/stress 99mTc-tetrofosmin human imaging pro￾tocol. The animal was positioned supine in the camera, and for the
99mTc studies, 370 and 1,100 MBq (10 and 30 mCi) were injected at
rest and stress, respectively, whereas the 201Tl studies used 37 and
110 MBq (1 and 3 mCi), respectively. Tracer was delivered intrave￾nously using a Harvard pump (Harvard Apparatus) as a 9-mL bolus
over 20 s, followed by a 9-mL saline flush over 20 s. Gold (rest) or
samarium (stress) neutron-activated microspheres (BioPal Inc.) were
injected by hand over 10 s into the left atrium at the same time as the
tracer. For each, blood was withdrawn from a femoral artery for
4 min at 4 mL/min starting just before microsphere injection. Image
data were acquired in list-mode for 11 min starting just before tracer
injection. Resting images were acquired first and repeated just before
stress. Stress was induced pharmacologically 1 h after the rest in￾jection using dipyridamole (0.14 mg/kg/min over 4 min). Phenyleph￾rine was given as needed to maintain blood pressure. At 4 min after
dipyridamole, the suture was tightened, occluding the LAD. Thirty
seconds after occlusion, tracer and microspheres were injected.
Two minutes after tracer injection, the occlusion was released. For
each animal, a CT scan (120 kVp, 1.0 mA, 2.0 rpm) was acquired for
attenuation correction (AC) on an Infinia-Hawkeye 4 SPECT/CT
camera (GE Healthcare), with the pig repositioned in the same ori￾entation as in the NM 530c camera. For the normal (nonoccluded)
animals, the same imaging procedure was used except that no occlu￾sion was performed.
Immediately after the CT scan, the pig was euthanized and the heart
extracted and sectioned. Similar to DaSilva et al. (15), the heart was
sliced perpendicular to the long axis and divided into the apex and 4
additional approximately 1-cm-thick short-axis slabs. The apex was
quartered, and the other slabs were sectioned into approximately 1-g
samples after removal of the right ventricle (a total of 44–50 pieces
per heart) and numbered clockwise from the LAD junction of the right
and left ventricles. The sections were weighed, measured off-site at
BioPal Inc., and converted into flow measurements using standard
methods (16). Seventeen-segment and 3-vascular-territory polar maps
of the microsphere MBF values were generated using the recorded
location of each tissue sample.
The acquired list-mode data were rebinned into 9 · 10, 6 · 15,
and 4 · 120 s frames. The initial frame duration was 10 s, similar
to our acquisition protocol used for clinical 82Rb PET imaging. The
frame duration was increased as the rate of change in the distribu￾tion slowed. Projection data for each frame were independently
reconstructed using manufacturer-supplied generalized expectation￾maximization maximum a posteriori iterative reconstruction (14)
without corrections (NC), with CT-based AC, and with AC and
scatter correction (SC) as detailed in the Supplemental Methods. SC
was performed on the projection data using a dual-energy-window
(99mTc tracers) or triple-energy-window (201Tl) estimate.
The reconstructed dynamic image series was processed using
FlowQuant (University of Ottawa Heart Institute Research Corpora￾tion), our semiautomated in-house kinetic analysis software (17).
A 1-tissue-compartment model (CM) was chosen because this model
has been shown to be sufficient by others for 201Tl (18) and 99mTc￾sestamibi (11). The 1 CM uptake rate constant, K1, is related to MBF
by:
K1 5 EFðMBFÞ MBF 5

12 eð2½aMBF 1 b=MBFÞ

MBF: Eq. 1
Equation 1 assumes a generalized Renkin–Crone model for the EF in￾which a and b are parameters to be fit to the data, and aMBF 1 b
corresponds to the permeability–surface-area product of the capillaries.

reduced uptake in right coronary artery territory of 201Tl polar map.

The FlowQuant software estimated K1 in each of 576 myocardial
polar-map sectors using nonlinear weighted least-squares regression
with weighting proportional to the frame duration. The goodness-of-fit
was evaluated with reduced x2 and coefficient of determination mea￾sures. The K1 polar map was then collapsed into either a 17-segment
representation (19) or 3 coronary vascular territories for comparison
to the microsphere data. The Spearman rank correlation between K1
and microsphere MBF was measured. The SPECT K1 and micro￾sphere MBF data were then fit to Equation 1 using a nonlinear least￾squares algorithm to determine the parameters a and b. The fitted
function was used to convert SPECT K1 to MBF, and the resultant
Pearson correlation to microsphere MBF was measured. The 17-
segment model provided a finer sampling of the data and thus
a greater range of flow values and a measure of the variability within
the normal or nonoccluded regions of each
heart. However, using smaller samples
increases the noise in the data, and—given
the spatial resolution of SPECT—the sam￾ples cannot be considered independent,
which may bias measures of correlation.
Therefore, we also averaged the data over
the 3 coronary vascular territories and re￾peated our analysis.
Comparisons between reconstruction
methods were done using Bonferroni-cor￾rected paired t tests. Comparisons between
tracers were done with an unpaired t test. A
P value of less than 0.05 was considered
significant. The noise level in the measured
data was calculated as the coefficient of var￾iation (COV) for the 17-segment data: the
SD divided by the mean of the nonoccluded
segments (microsphere MFR $ 1.5) of the
heart.
RESULTS
There was little change in the pig heart
rate or blood pressure between rest and
stress (Supplemental Table 1). The maxi￾mum counting rate recorded in the studies
was 106 kcps at stress and 35 kcps at rest,
well below the camera counting rate limit.

frame averaged 127 and 31 kilocounts at rest for 99mTc tracers
and 201Tl, respectively, and 438 and 144 kilocounts at stress for 99mTc tracers and 201Tl, respectively. In all cases, the myocardial
curve showed a good fit to the measured values using the 1 CM
(Fig. 1), and there was no significant difference in the reduced x2
(P . 0.24) between the reconstruction methods. The reduced x2
for the fit to the stress data averaged 0.99 6 0.06 overall and
1.03 6 0.06, 0.95 6 0.02, and 0.99 6 0.06 for 201Tl, 99mTc￾tetrofosmin, and 99mTc-sestamibi, respectively. The values for
rest were similar. The coefficient of determination (R2) of the
NC fit were similar for the 99mTc tracers, averaging 0.92 6 0.06
(rest) and 0.94 6 0.02 (stress), and for 201Tl were 0.80 6 0.08
(rest) and 0.93 6 0.03 (stress). R2 values close to 1 suggest that
the 1 CM was adequate to describe the shape of the measured
time–activity curves. The R2 values for AC were similar to NC,
but the values for AC and scatter correction (ACSC) were lower,
reflecting the increase in noise due to SC; the 99mTc tracers
averaged 0.88 6 0.04 (rest, P 5 0.02 vs. NC) and 0.91 6
0.03 (stress, P 5 0.05 vs. NC) and for 201Tl the R2 was 0.44
6 0.13 (rest, P , 0.01 vs. NC) and 0.74 6 0.06 (stress, P ,
0.01 vs. NC). Despite lower R2, the K1 values for 201Tl with
ACSC were still estimated with good precision (Table 1), and the
COV was not significantly more than that for NC.
The uptake rate constants K1 for the 3 tracers correlated well
with microsphere MBF, based on ACSC reconstructions and 17-
segment analysis (Fig. 2). The results were similar for NC and AC
reconstructions and for the 3-coronary-territory analysis (Supple￾mental Figs. 2–7). The average COV values for K1-rest, K1-stress,
and the ratio of stress/rest K1 (MFR*) were 13%–23% for 201Tl
and 9%–19% for the 99mTc tracers (Table 1). The average COV for
the resting microsphere flow measurement was 14%. The Spear￾man rank correlations (r) (Table 2) were good for 201Tl, with a r
of 0.76 or greater for K1 versus microsphere MBF and a r of 0.79
or greater for MFR* versus MFR. For 99mTc-tetrofosmin, the cor￾relation was also good for K1 (r $ 0.65), though MFR* was lower
(0.30 #r# 0.62). For 99mTc-sestamibi, the correlation was good
for MFR* (r $ 0.80) and K1 with the 17-segment analysis (r $
0.67) but lower for K1 with the 3-territory analysis (r $ 0.51).
The combined 17-segment rest and stress K1 data from the
ACSC images were fit to the microsphere flow values using Equa￾tion 1 (Fig. 3) and a similar fit was performed with the 3-coronary￾territory data (Supplemental Fig. 8). The resulting fits (Table 3)
produced EFs that matched well with the literature (Fig. 4).
After correction of K1 to MBF, the slopes of the linear fits of 17-
segment (Fig. 5) and 3-coronary-territory (Supplemental Fig. 9)
SPECT MBF data to microsphere MBF were between 1.01 and
1.04. The Pearson correlation coefficients for the 17-segment MBF
were all good: r 5 0.75–0.83 (Table 3). For MFR, the correlation
coefficient was r 5 0.57 for 99mTc-tetrofosmin, r 5 0.79 for 201Tl, and r 5 0.89 for 99mTc-sestamibi. For the 3-coronary
territory analysis, the MBF Pearson correlation coefficients were
r 5 0.79–90 and the MFR correlations were r 5 0.62–0.94.

DISCUSSION
This study demonstrates, for the first time to our knowledge, the
accurate quantification of MBF in an ischemic pig model using
attenuation- and scatter-corrected dynamic SPECT imaging with
201Tl, 99mTc-sestamibi, and 99mTc-tetrofosmin on a cardiac-dedicated
scanner.
AC and SC improve the accuracy of the images but also
increase noise. Image noise varied with the radiotracer and
reconstruction method as shown by the COV in Table 1. Consid￾ering all of the tracers combined, at stress AC has a lower COV
than NC (P 5 0.02) or ACSC (P , 0.01) and ACSC is not
significantly different from NC (P 5 0.56). The results for rest
and MFR were similar. Thus, the increase in noise with AC was
more than offset by the reduction in attenuation artifacts but,
whereas SC may improve accuracy, it came at the cost of increas￾ing COV back to NC levels. Reducing noise by including scatter
within the reconstruction or using more advanced multidimen￾sional reconstruction algorithms (9) might thus be beneficial.
When 201Tl was compared with 99mTc-tetrofosmin, the noise lev￾els were not significantly different with NC (P . 0.18), but 201Tl
had significantly higher COV with AC and ACSC (P , 0.02).
These differences reflect the increased noise in the 201Tl images
caused by a reduced amount of injected tracer. The rank correla￾tions of K1 and MFR* with microsphere MBF and MFR (Table 2)
were similar for all reconstruction methods.
The 99mTc-tetrofosmin and 99mTc-sestamibi results (Figs. 2
and 3) showed the expected reduction in measured K1 and
MFR* at higher blood flow values (20). Thus, although the
noise levels in the 99mTc datasets were lower than with 201Tl,
the ratio of normal stress over rest flow (MFR) was also lower,
producing a similar signal-to-noise ratio. For NC, AC, and ACSC
in the nonoccluded segments of the heart, both 201Tl and 99mTc￾tetrofosmin produced average MFR*s that were 2.1–2.6 SDs above
1, and for 99mTc-sestamibi they were 1.5–1.8 SDs above 1 (Table
1). The average measured MFR* value for 99mTc-sestamibi (1.3–
1.5) is in agreement with other studies that have measured MFR*
with SPECT using simplified alternative methods (5,11). Benefiting
from the higher mean MFR* values for 201Tl will require improved
techniques to reduce noise such as prior-based multidimensional
reconstruction (9).
The injected activities used in these studies were typical of 1-d
human clinical protocols. The pigs in this study were smaller
than typical patients, resulting in less attenuation and scatter and
leading to better-quality images for dynamic processing. In
addition, there is increasing motivation to capitalize on the
dedicated cardiac camera’s increased sensitivity to reduce the pa￾tient radiation exposure. These factors may lead to a decreased

signal-to-noise when applying this approach to human studies.
Evaluation in humans against an accepted gold standard such as
quantitative PET perfusion imaging is needed before considering
implementation of this technique for routine clinical SPECT flow
measurement.
In this study, the tracer was injected as an extended bolus over
20 s. Our typical clinical protocol for 82Rb flow imaging with PET
uses a constant-activity-rate injection over 30 s whereas others
have suggested a much more rapid injection (11). Previous work
with PET has shown that use of longer tracer injection times can
improve the quantitative accuracy and precision of flow measure￾ments (21). Our data were reprocessed by subdividing the three
10-s frames near the peak of the arterial input function into ten 3-s
frames in an effort to better sample the peak. The results (not
shown) did not show any improvement in correlation with micro￾sphere flow. However, further work would be needed to determine
whether extending the bolus duration could improve the SPECT
flow measurements.
Release of the occlusion 2 min after tracer injection will result
in a change in flow and potentially reactive hyperemia within the
occluded tissues. The uptake of 99mTc tracers is rapid and static,
but 201Tl is known to redistribute after reperfusion (22). Residual
tracer in the blood or redistributing tracer during the last 9 min of
imaging would be taken up under different flow conditions after
reperfusion and this may have degraded the accuracy of 201Tl MBF
measurements, compared with microspheres in the ischemic region.
This work used a 1 CM to fit all of the data for both 201Tl and 99mTc tracers. Previous work with 201Tl has suggested that al￾though a 2 CM is more accurate physiologically (18), the 1 CM
produces K1 estimates that are almost as accurate and are related
to the 2 CM fits by a simple scaling factor of 0.8. These results
suggest that a 1 CM may be more suitable for practical application
for which the noise levels in the images are higher and imaging
times are shorter (23). Scaling our 1 CM K1 values by 1/0.8 gen￾erates an EF for 201Tl that agrees with the literature (Fig. 4) (24–
26). However, the number of animals used in our study was lim￾ited, and the value of a 1 CM over a 2 CM must still be assessed in
more complex disease states such as mixed-normal, ischemic, and
infarcted tissues. Considered separately, the ischemic and remote
territories at stress were mostly not significantly different from
microspheres but showed a trend toward underestimation of
MBF that will require further study (Supplemental Table 3). The
appropriate model for the 99mTc tracers has not been extensively
explored. However, other studies using a 1 CM with a k2 of 0 (5,11)
have demonstrated a successful measurement of global MFR*. In
addition, the reduced x2 values and R2 values of the fits to the 99mTc data suggest that the 1 CM provided a good description of
the tracer kinetics in our experiments. Also, the EF for 99mTc￾sestamibi using the 1 CM agrees with previous literature (Fig. 4)
(25). Nevertheless, a more complex model could lead to an im￾provement in the correlation with microspheres and could be ex￾plored in future studies.
This study used a clinically feasible acquisition protocol and
clinically appropriate doses of 3 common tracers. However, 99mTc
tracers have limited extraction at high flow rates, and although
studies measuring MFR with these tracers are promising (6,11)
contrast between stress and resting flows will be less than that
typically seen with PET. SPECT also has lower sensitivity than
PET, increasing the noise in the images despite the increased
sensitivity of the dedicated cardiac SPECT cameras, and SPECT
spatial resolution is worse than PET, which increases partial-volume
effects. Finally, there were only 19 animals used in the study, di￾vided over 3 tracers. The limited number of samples at the extreme
ends of the MBF range may affect the fit and introduce some error
into the final measure values. Also, tracer uptake and response to
dipyridamole varies among animals and so caution should be exer￾cised to not overgeneralize the results of these experiments. Thus,
whereas these pig studies show a promising correlation with micro￾sphere MBF, full validation in humans is needed before we can
confidently move to clinical implementation.
CONCLUSION
We have demonstrated that it is possible, in a pig model of rest
and transient occlusion at stress, to use a stationary dedicated
cardiac camera to perform dynamic SPECT for the measurement
of absolute myocardial blood flow with 201Tl, 99mTc-tetrofosmin,
and 99mTc-sestamibi. The correlations of the SPECT- to microsphere￾derived flow values were good (r $ 0.75). The approach used is
readily translated to human studies and could provide incremental
diagnostic and prognostic information over relative perfusion
alone but will require further validation before it can be clinically
implemented.
