In patients with acute HF (AHF), loop diuretics are the stan￾dard foundation therapy, and are mainly used to remove lung and 
peripheral edema during the acute phase.3 In the Therapeutic 
Impact of Vasopressin Antagonist in Congestive Heart Failure 
(ACTIV in CHF) and Efficacy of Vasopressin Antagonism in 
Heart Failure Outcome Study With Tolvaptan (EVEREST) tri￾als, tolvaptan was used for worsening HF, and it immediately 
improved dyspnea and rapidly reduced body weight.4,5 Howev￾er; the long-term prognosis of patients did not change in com￾parison with patients who were treated with loop diuretics. In 
those trials, patients with mild AHF who were treated in the 
general wards were included, so the effects of tolvaptan ther￾olvaptan is an oral selective vasopressin 2 receptor an￾tagonist that acts on the distal nephrons and causes a 
loss of electrolyte-free water. It uses a new mechanism 
of action for producing water diuresis, and is now mainly used 
in patients with uncontrollable chronic heart failure (HF) who 
exhibit refractory edema despite the use of loop diuretics, spi￾ronolactone and thiazide diuretics. Studies of the efficacy of 
tolvaptan have been mainly performed in chronic, stable and 
advanced HF patients.1,2

Background: Tolvaptan, an oral selective vasopressin 2 receptor antagonist that acts on the distal nephrons to 
cause a loss of electrolyte-free water, is rarely used during the acute phase of acute heart failure (AHF).
Methods and Results: We investigated 183 AHF patients admitted to the intensive care unit and administered tolvap￾tan (7.5mg) with continuous intravenous furosemide, and then additionally at 12-h intervals until HF was compen￾sated. When intravenous furosemide was changed to peroral use, the administration of tolvaptan was stopped. The 
patients were assigned to tolvaptan (n=52) or conventional treatment (n=131) groups. The amount of intravenous 
furosemide was significantly lower (35.4 [16.3–56.0] mg vs. 80.0 [30.4–220.0] mg), the urine volume was significantly 
higher on days 1 and 2 (3,691 [3,109–4,198] ml and 2,953 [2,128–3,592] ml vs. 2,270 [1,535–3,258] ml and 2,129 
[1,407–2,906] ml) and the numbers of patients with worsening-AKI (step-up RIFLE Class to I or F) and Class F were 
significantly fewer (5.8% and 1.9% vs. 19.1% and 16.0%) in the tolvaptan group than in the conventional group, re￾spectively. One of the specific medications indicated worsening-AKI and in-hospital mortality was tolvaptan (odds ratio 
[OR] 0.155, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.037–0.657 and OR 0.191, 95% CI 0.037–0.985). The Kaplan-Meier curves 
showed that the death rate within 6 months was significantly lower in the tolvaptan group. The same result was found 
after propensity matching of the data.
Conclusions: Early administration of tolvaptan could prevent exacerbation of AKI and improve the prognosis for 
AHF patients.  (Circ J 2014; 78: 911–921)

stopped and changed to peroral diuretics. The tolvaptan treat￾ment was performed in addition to the intravenous furosemide 
within 12h after admission. Tolvaptan (7.5mg) was adminis￾tered with the continuous intravenous furosemide, and addition￾ally at 12-h intervals until the HF was compensated. Tolvaptan 
was administered via nasogastric tubes in patients requiring 
endotracheal intubation. When intravenous furosemide was 
changed to peroral use, the administration of tolvaptan was dis￾continued (Figure 1). There were no limitations for the treat￾ment of AHF, and the treatment strategy was chosen by each 
physician. Treatment with tolvaptan is generally not recom￾mended in unconscious and sedated patients; however, all pa￾tients were treated in the ICU. The urine volume and water 
balance were measured every hour, and the sodium level was 
measured every 3h. We therefore performed adequate transfu￾sion immediately according to a change in urine volume, water 
balance and sodium level. Informed consent was given by the 
patients or their family members, such that (1) tolvaptan was 
used only in patients in whom the treatment was determined 
to be safe by the physician, (2) the study was not a randomized 
placebo-controlled trial and (3) tolvaptan was used safely 
under ICU monitoring. 
We evaluated the relationship between tolvaptan therapy and 
the following factors: urine volume, the amount of furosemide, 
vital signs, urinary markers (urinary neutrophil gelatinase-asso￾ciated lipocalin [u-NGAL], the urinary liver fatty acid-binding 
protein [u-LFABP] and serum heart-type fatty acid-binding 
protein [s-HFABP] levels), the degree of AKI during the first 
5 days (Class R [risk], Class I [injury] or Class F [failure]), the 
timing of AKI and the outcomes.
Evaluation of AKI
Because urine output could not be precisely measured in the 
general ward, and because all AHF patients receive treatment 
with diuretics, which influences urine output, AKI was inves￾tigated solely on the basis of the creatinine criteria of the 
RIFLE classification.12 The RIFLE classification is based on the 
ratio of the maximum serum creatinine value recorded during 
the first 5 days to the baseline creatinine value. Patients were 
classified as no-AKI, Class R (risk), Class I (injury) or Class 
apy during the acute phase of AHF in patients who are severely 
decompensated and need treatment in the intensive care unit 
(ICU) have not been sufficiently examined. In patients with 
AHF, acute kidney injury (AKI) during the acute phase has been 
shown to lead to an adverse outcome.6–8 Although it still remains 
controversial with regard to whether there is an association 
between a worse outcome and high-dose furosemide,3 patients 
who need high-dose oral loop diuretics as outpatients require 
a higher bolus of intravenous furosemide to remove the vol￾ume overload within 72h, and this leads to poorer prognosis in 
patients with AHF.9 We therefore examined if the immediate 
administration of tolvaptan could reduce the amount of furo￾semide required, could prevent the worsening of AKI, and ul￾timately lead to a better outcome for severely decompensated 
AHF patients. 
Methods
Subjects
We prospectively enrolled 183 consecutive AHF patients who 
were admitted to the ICU of Chiba Hokusoh Hospital, Nippon 
Medical School, between April 2010 and December 2012 and 
who needed diuretics. AHF was defined as either new-onset 
HF or decompensation of chronic HF with symptoms sufficient 
to warrant hospitalization.10 The diagnosis of HF was based on 
the Framingham criteria for a clinical diagnosis of HF, based on 
the satisfaction of 2 major criteria or 1 major and 2 minor cri￾teria.11 All patients had a New York Heart Association (NYHA) 
functional class of either III or IV. Patients who had undergone 
renal replacement therapy before admission, or underwent an 
emergency operation during the first 5 days after admission were 
excluded from the present study. 
Procedure
Tolvaptan was administrated at the physician’s discretion to re￾move the volume overload. Patients were divided into 2 groups: 
a conventional treatment group (n=131) and a tolvaptan group 
(n=52). Conventional treatment included continuous intrave￾nous loop diuretics (furosemide) with/without other diuretics. 
When the HF was compensated, intravenous furosemide was

Figure 1.  Conventional treatment for acute heart failure (HF) was performed using a continuous intravenous (civ.) loop diuretic 
(furosemide) and other diuretics. When HF was compensated, intravenous furosemide was ceased, and changed to peroral ad￾ministration. Tolvaptan treatment was given in addition to intravenous furosemide treatment: 7.5 mg tolvaptan was administered 
with the continuous intravenous furosemide, and at 12-h intervals until HF was compensated. When intravenous furosemide was 
changed to peroral (po) use, the administration of tolvaptan was discontinued.

Tolvaptan Therapy for AHF 913
Urinary Biomarker Excretion and Serum Biomarker 
Measurements
The urine and blood samples were collected within 30min of 
admission (Day 1), in hospital after 72h (Day 4) and after 14 
days (Day 14). The urine and blood samples were centrifuged 
within 5min at 4°C, and immediately frozen at −80°C until 
they were analyzed. The serum levels of HFABP, and urinary 
NGAL and LFABP levels were measured at each sampling 
point. These urine and serum biomarkers were measured by the 
Special Reference Laboratory (SRL©, Tokyo, Japan). The level 
of urine LFABP was measured with an enzyme-linked immu￾nosorbent assay (ELISA) using a human LFABP ELISA kit 
(Kyowa Medex Co, Tokyo, Japan). The level of urinary NGAL 
was measured using the NGAL ELISA Kit (R&D Systems, 
Inc, Minneapolis, MN, USA), and the serum HFABP was mea￾sured using a MARKIT-M HFABP ELISA kit or a LIBLIA 
H-FABP latex agglutination turbidimetric immunoassay (DS 
Pharma Biomedical, Osaka, Japan). The lower and upper limits 
of detection for the urinary NGAL concentration were 4pg/ml 
and 500pg/ml, respectively, and the lower limit for the urine 
LFABP was 2.9pg/ml. The urine and serum samples were ob￾tained from all 183 patients on Day 1, from 174 patients on Day 
4 (5 patients had died and 4 samples were not collected) and 
from 159 on Day 14 (10 patients had died, 8 patients were trans￾ferred to other hospitals and 6 samples were not collected). 
Prognosis
The short-term prognosis was evaluated as the length of ICU 
stay, length of total hospitalization and the in-hospital mortal￾ity. The independent medications that predicted in-hospital mor￾tality were identified by a multivariate logistic regression model. 
Furthermore, the mid-term prognosis was also evaluated, and 
included all-cause death within 6 months. The patients were 
clinically followed-up at a routine outpatient clinic. In the pa￾tients who were followed-up at other institutes, their progno￾ses were determined by telephone contact. The survival rates 
were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier curves according to the use 
of tolvaptan therapy. A Cox regression analysis was performed 
to obtain the hazard ratio (HR) for 180-day mortality.
Statistical Analysis
All data were statistically analyzed using the SPSS 20.0 J soft￾ware program (SPSS Japan Institute, Tokyo, Japan). All nu￾merical data were expressed as the mean±standard deviation 
or median (range or 25–75% interquartile range). Unpaired 
Student’s t-tests or the Mann-Whitney U-test were used to com￾pare 2 groups, and a Kruskal-Wallis test was used to compare 
3 groups. Normality was assessed using the Shapiro-Wilk W 
test. Comparisons of all proportions were performed with a chi￾square analysis. The significant medications indicating the de￾velopment of worsening-AKI and in-hospital mortality were 
F (failure).
The RIFLE classification of patients who received renal re￾placement therapy was Class F.13 The serum creatinine levels 
in patients without chronic kidney disease (CKD) (according 
to their medical data) were calculated using the Modification 
of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation as recommended 
by the Acute Dialysis Quality Initiative, by solving the MDRD 
equation for serum creatinine (CrMDRD) assuming a glomeru￾lar filtration rate (GFR) of 75ml·min−1 ·1.73m−2.
14,15 The base￾line level of creatinine was the lowest value recorded during the 
admission of patients with CKD. The lower of the lowest cre￾atinine values during hospitalization or the CrMDRD creatinine 
served as the baseline value for patients without CKD. 
CKD was defined as a syndrome comprising a low GFR 
(<60ml·min−1 ·1.73m−2) with a history lasting for more than 3 
months.16 Patients who did not have medical records at Chiba 
Hokusoh Hospital for the 3 months before admission were di￾agnosed with CKD using another institution’s data for the 3 
months before admission or based on the 3 months of data after 
admission to the hospital. Kidney damage, as identified by ab￾normal findings in the urine and imaging tests,16 was diagnosed 
in some of the patients in the present study; therefore, CKD was 
diagnosed based only on a history of a low GFR for more than 
3 months. 
In total, 100 patients had CKD (54.6%), comprising 78 pa￾tients (42.6%) diagnosed from the previous 3 months’ data be￾fore admission and 23 patients (12.6%) diagnosed by the 3 
months’ data after admission. Therefore, the baseline level of 
creatinine was defined as the lowest value recorded during the 
admission for these patients. The remaining 83 patients did not 
have CKD (45.4%), and for them the baseline level of creatinine 
was defined as the CrMDRD creatinine for 36 patients (44.0%) 
and the lowest creatinine value for 47 patients (56.0%). 
The occurrence of AKI was evaluated by the RIFLE clas￾sification during the first 5 days; 44 patients were identified on 
admission, and the number of patients according to each class 
were as follows: Class R (n=27), Class I (n=11) and Class F 
(n=6). During the first 5 days, AKI developed in an additional 
34 patients who did not have it on admission; 17 of the 27 pa￾tients who were Class R on admission continued to be classified 
as Class R, while 7 and 3 patients changed to Class I and Class 
F, respectively, during the first 5 days; 4 of the 11 patients who 
were Class I at admission continued to be classified as Class 
I, while 7 of the patients changed to Class F. Moreover, all 6 
Class F patients continued to be classified as having Class F 
AKI. The timing of AKI (development of AKI) was defined as 
follows: step-up RIFLE class to Class I and F during the first 
5 days (worsening-AKI) (Table 1). The independent medica￾tions that predicted worsening-AKI were identified by a mul￾tivariate logistic regression model.

Results
Patients’ Characteristics
Table 2 shows the baseline clinical characteristics of the 183 
patients enrolled who received either tolvaptan (tolvaptan group; 
n=52) conventional treatment (conventional group; n=131). The 
patient cohort included 73.4% male subjects, with a mean age 
of 77 years; 86 (47.0%) patients had ischemic heart disease, and 
97 (53.0%) had non-ischemic heart disease, including cardio￾myopathy (n=23), hypertensive heart disease (n=25), valvular 
disease (n=41) and other disease (n=8). The majority of the pa￾tients were in NYHA Class IV (79.8%), and the average LVEF 
determined by transthoracic echocardiography at the time of 
admission was 38.0%. 
The number of males was significantly higher, the LVEF was 
significantly reduced and the serum levels of hemoglobin were 
significantly higher in the tolvaptan group (76.9%, 32% and 
13.7 [12.2–14.7] g/dl) than in the conventional group (58.0%, 
40%, and 11.9 [10.4–13.4] g/dl). The other patient information 
was not significantly different between the 2 groups.
Medication During the First 5 Days, Vital Signs, AKI and 
Biomarkers
The relationship between medications and tolvaptan therapy 
is shown in Table 3. Carperitide was administered less often 
in the tolvaptan group (28.8%) than in the conventional group 
identified by the multivariate logistic regression model. A P￾value <0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. The 
survival rates were analyzed between groups using Kaplan￾Meier curves, and significant differences were calculated using 
the log-rank test. The prognostic value of tolvaptan therapy 
compared with conventional therapy was assessed using a Cox 
regression hazard model for 180-day mortality.
After the data were initially analyzed, we performed a propen￾sity-matched analysis to minimize the potential selection bias. 
Based on a multivariate logistic regression model, each patient 
was assigned a propensity score. The covariates in the model 
included sex, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), serum 
levels of hemoglobin, creatinine and other baseline variables. 
The discrimination and calibration abilities of the propensity￾score model were adequately assessed by receiver-operating 
characteristic (ROC) curves (area under the curves [AUC]: 
0.682) and the Hosmer-Lemeshow test (P=0.843). Patients in the 
tolvaptan and conventional groups were matched by 2 digits 
in a 1:1 ratio, based on the estimated propensity score for treat￾ment with tolvaptan.
Ethical Concerns
The institutional review board at Chiba Hokusoh Hospital, 
Nippon Medical School approved the study protocol.

Tolvaptan Therapy for AHF 915
tolvaptan (odds ratio [OR] 0.155, 95% confidence interval [CI] 
0.037–0.657) was related to worsening-AKI (Table 4).
The urinary NGAL and LFABP levels were significantly de￾creased from Day 1 to Day 4 in both groups. Urinary LFABP 
excretion did not differ between the tolvaptan and conventional 
groups, but the serum level of HFABP was significantly lower 
in the tolvaptan group than in the conventional group on Day 
4 and Day 14 (Table 5). 
Short- and Mid-Term Prognosis
The length of total hospitalization tended to be shorter in the 
tolvaptan group than in the conventional group (Table 3). The 
results of the multivariate logistic regression model for in-hospi￾tal mortality found that tolvaptan (OR 0.191, 95% CI 0.037–
0.985) was associated with mortality (Table 4). All 23 deaths 
that occurred (12.6%) during the 6 months following admission 
were cardiovascular deaths. The Kaplan-Meier curves showed 
that the all-cause death rate was significantly lower in the tolvap￾tan group compared with the conventional group (Figure 2). 
The multivariate Cox regression model indicated that tolvaptan 
therapy (HR 0.177, 95% CI 0.037–0.843) was an independent 
predictor of 180-day mortality (Table 6).
(56.5%), but none of the other medications was used differently 
between the 2 groups. The mean dose of tolvaptan used for the 
compensation of AHF was 22.5 [22.5–37.5] mg. The doses of 
continuous intravenous furosemide and carperitide during the 
first 48h were significantly lower in the tolvaptan group than 
in the conventional group, but the dose of oral furosemide fol￾lowing cessation of continuous intravenous use was significantly 
higher in the tolvaptan group than in the conventional group. 
The urine volumes on days 1 and 2 were significantly higher in 
the tolvaptan group than in the conventional group. The water 
balance on days 1 and 2 was significantly reduced in the tolvap￾tan group compared with that observed in the conventional 
group. 
The systolic blood pressure (SBP) values at 48h were signifi￾cantly higher in the tolvaptan group than in the conventional 
group, and the changes in SBP from ICU admission to 24h were 
significantly smaller in the tolvaptan group than in the conven￾tional group. 
The relationship between AKI and tolvaptan therapy is shown 
in Table 3. Worsening-AKI and Class F patients were signifi￾cantly less common in the tolvaptan group (5.8% and 1.9%) than 
in the conventional group (19.1% and 16.0%). The results of the 
multivariate logistic regression model showed that the use of

Tolvaptan Therapy for AHF 919
The results of the multivariate logistic regression model for 
in-hospital mortality found that the only specific medication 
associated with the mortality rate was tolvaptan (OR 0.034, 
95% CI 0.002–0.662) (Table 4). The Kaplan-Meier curves 
showed that the all-cause death rate was significantly lower in 
the tolvaptan group compared with the conventional group 
(Figure 2). The multivariate Cox regression model indicated 
that tolvaptan therapy (HR 0.057, 95% CI 0.003–0.932) was 
an independent predictor of 180-day mortality (Table 6).
Discussion
We were able to use tolvaptan safety during the acute phase of 
AHF without clinically significant hypernatremia or hypoten￾sion. Immediate administration of tolvaptan reduced the amount 
of loop diuretics needed, achieved a sufficient urine volume, 
prevented the worsening of AKI and improved the short- and 
mid-term prognosis of patients. Studies of patients with HF re￾quire that there are satisfactory acute effects in hospitalized pa￾tients and that they have a better long-term outcome. Our pres￾1 and 2 were significantly higher in the tolvaptan group (3,780 
[2,609–4,141]ml and 2,714 [1,861–3,540]ml) than in the con￾ventional group (2,199 [1,530–3,589]ml and 1,916 [1,067–
2,748]ml). Furthermore, worsening-AKI and Class F patients 
were significantly less common in the tolvaptan group (2.7% 
and 2.7%) than in the conventional group (21.6% and 21.6%) 
(Table 3). The SBP values at 24 and 48h were significantly 
higher in the tolvaptan group (116 [110–138]mmHg and 122 
[110–142]mmHg) than in the conventional group (108 [100–
120]mmHg and 110 [100–126]mmHg), and the changes in SBP 
from ICU admission to 24h were significantly smaller in the 
tolvaptan group (−12 [−30–4]mmHg) than in the conventional 
group (−20 [−42 to −8]mmHg). The results of the multivariate 
logistic regression model for worsening-AKI found that the 
only specific medication associated with the AKI was tolvaptan 
(OR 0.050, 95% CI 0.004–0.582) (Table 4). The serum level 
of HFABP tended to be lower in the tolvaptan group than in 
the conventional group on Day 4 (7.4 [3.6–10.2]ng/ml vs. 9.1 
[5.4–13.6]ng/ml) and was significantly lower on Day 14 (4.4 
[2.5–6.6]ng/ml vs. 6.3 [4.6±8.3]ng/ml) (Table 5). 
Figure 2.  (A,B) Kaplan-Meier survival curves show that the all-cause death during the 6 months after admission was signifi￾cantly higher in patients treated with conventional therapy (n=131) than in those who received tolvaptan therapy (n=52) (P=0.032). 
The same result was revealed after propensity matching (P=0.030).

are some differences between our study and the EVEREST trial. 
First, the patients were randomized within 48h of hospitalization 
in the EVEREST trial, which means that tolvaptan might have 
been administered after sufficient diuresis had already been 
achieved by the administration of other diuretics. Moreover, the 
amount of loop diuretics given pre- and post-administration of 
tolvaptan was not mentioned. Second, the patients in NYHA 
Class III comprised 58.2%, and NYHA Class IV patients com￾prised 41.8% of the total patients in that study. In the present 
study, 20.2% of patients were NYHA Class III and 79.8% were 
NYHA Class IV, so the majority of patients in our study need￾ed respiratory support, such as endotracheal intubation and non￾invasive positive pressure ventilation. In addition, all of the 
present patients needed to be treated in the ICU, which means 
that more severely decompensated patients were included in 
our study population than in the EVEREST trial. Therefore, the 
present findings indicate that tolvaptan therapy might improve 
the prognosis for AHF when it is administered immediately, and 
to more severely compromised patients. It has not been previ￾ously reported that tolvaptan therapy could prevent an adverse 
outcome in AHF patients. 
We reported previously that patients with AKI, especially 
Class I and F patients, had a worse in-hospital mortality and a 
worse long-term prognosis in comparison with no-AKI pa￾tients.7,8 In the present study, tolvaptan could prevent worsening￾AKI and development of a severe degree of AKI. The prevention 
of AKI might have led to the better mid-term prognosis in the 
tolvaptan group in our study. 
The secretion of a variety of hormones, including renin, nor￾epinephrine and arginine vasopressin (AVP) has been shown 
to be activated in patients with HF.25 These hormones activate 
the RAAS system, sympathetic nervous system and aquaporin 
(AQP)-associated water reabsorption system, and constitute a 
vicious cycle of HF with ventricular remodeling and increased 
afterload/preload in patients with left ventricular dysfunction 
with congestive HF.26 Loop diuretics also activate the RAAS 
system and the sympathetic nervous system, and the ADHRE 
registry has suggested that there may be adverse effects of treat￾ment with intravenous loop diuretics.17 In the present study, 
tolvaptan achieved a significantly greater urine volume with 
low-dose furosemide in the acute phase of AHF than did con￾ventional treatment. This means that using tolvaptan could de￾crease the dose of furosemide required, which might also lead 
to a better prognosis. 
With a view to breaking this vicious HF/remodeling/loading 
cycle, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI), an￾giotensin II receptor blockers, spironolactones and β-blockers 
are known to improve the neurohormonal profile and have been 
shown to significantly reduce mortality and morbidity in chron￾ic HF patients.27 Intravenous administration of carperitide was 
also reported to lead to a better prognosis for AHF patients.28
During the past decade, the available therapies have not been 
demonstrated to effectively block vasopressin and their use may 
permit or contribute to the progression of HF. Immediate ad￾ministration of tolvaptan, which acts as a vasopressin type 2 
receptor antagonist, might contribute to a better prognosis by 
affecting the neurohormonal profile in the (AQP)-associated 
water reabsorption system during the early period of AHF. 
Study Limitations
The present study had several possible limitations. First, it was 
performed in a single center, and was not a randomized, double￾blind, placebo-controlled study, because it is difficult to prospec￾tively evaluate the benefits of drug treatment in the urgent phase 
in patients with AHF. There were significant differences in the 
ent findings indicate that the administration of tolvaptan might 
be reasonable in patients with AHF.
Immediate Tolvaptan Therapy for AHF and For Preserving 
Renal Function
Intravenous furosemide is the mainstay fundamental diuretic 
therapy for AHF. However, volume reduction by loop diuretics 
leads to a decrease in the renal blood flow in patients with renal 
dysfunction. Furthermore, loop diuretics activate the renin–
angiotensin–aldosterone (RAAS) system and the sympathetic 
nervous system, which can lead to a deterioration of renal func￾tion, and may induce adverse effects in patients with AHF.17 In 
contrast, tolvaptan acts as a diuretic without activating the RAAS 
system.18 Moreover, it can also increase renal blood flow, de￾crease renal vascular resistance and improve the GFR in patients 
with HF.19 It was also reported to be an optimally effective 
diuretic for patients with CKD.20 Furthermore, it increased urine 
output in a dose-dependent manner, without causing changes 
in renal function in advanced HF patients.2 It was recently re￾ported that treatment with tolvaptan could prevent worsening 
renal function compared with conventional therapy in patients 
with AHF with a high risk of worsening renal failure.21 Some 
other studies have shown favorable effects of tolvaptan on renal 
function when used in HF patients.5 Treatment with tolvaptan 
is associated with instantaneous osmotic movement of extra￾vascular fluid into the intravascular compartment, thus main￾taining BP.1,5 Moreover, few patients received carperitide in 
this study; therefore, the BP values were maintained. The main￾tenance of BP is associated with prevention of worsening-AKI 
in the acute phase of AHF. 
Traditionally, AKI has been attributed to hypoperfusion of 
the kidney because of either progressive impairment of cardiac 
output or intravascular volume depletion secondary to the ag￾gressive use of diuretics.22 However, attention has shifted from 
cardiac output (“forward failure”) to venous congestion (“back￾ward failure”) as the most important hemodynamic determi￾nant.23 The development of “congestive kidney failure” induced 
by increased renal venous pressure arising from venous conges￾tion (increased renal afterload) and increased renal interstitial 
pressure (intrinsic renal compromise) might be important mech￾anisms underlying the development of AKI in AHF patients.24
In these situations, tolvaptan, which has a stronger diuretic ef￾fect and could provide a larger gain in urine volume, might be 
effective to rapidly resolve renal congestion. Immediate admin￾istration of tolvaptan might be reasonable to address the patho￾physiology of AKI in AHF patients. In fact, the biomarkers 
indicating proximal renal tubular injury, such as the urinary 
NGAL and LFABP levels, did not differ on Day 4 and Day 14 
between the tolvaptan and conventional groups in the present 
study. However, biomarkers reflecting ongoing myocardial dam￾age, such as the serum HFABP level,24 were more decreased in 
the tolvaptan group on Day 4 and Day 14, which might suggest 
a reduction in myocardial damage with tolvaptan therapy. 
Immediate Tolvaptan Therapy for AHF, and Prognosis of 
AHF Patients
In the Multicenter Evaluation of Tolvaptan Effects on Left 
Ventricular Remodeling (METER) trial, tolvaptan reduced the 
combined endpoints of mortality and HF hospitalization in sta￾ble HF patients.1 In patients hospitalized for worsening HF, the 
ACTIV-HF trials showed reduced 60-day mortality when tolvap￾tan treatment was initiated within the first 48h of hospitaliza￾tion;5 however; the EVEREST trial did not show a significant 
improvement in the 2 primary endpoints (all-cause mortality and 
cardiovascular death) or in hospitalization rates for HF.4 There

baseline patient characteristics of the tolvaptan and conventional 
groups. Therefore, we matched the patients’ baseline using pro￾pensity scores, however; we could not rule out the possibility 
that unspecified factors affected the results of our analysis. Fur￾ther studies, including randomized, double-blind and placebo￾controlled studies, in severely decompensated AHF patients will 
be required. Second, the ratio of the maximum serum creatinine 
to baseline creatinine level was underestimated in patients with 
CKD because of their high baseline creatinine values. This might 
have affected the prognosis. Third, we could not obtain the pre￾vious medical records in all cases, so we were obliged to evalu￾ate chronic kidney injury using the post-admission medical re￾cords in some cases. Fourth, we did not analyze the differences 
between responders and non-responders among the AHF pa￾tients. Imamura et al reported that urine osmolality predicts 
the responders to tolvaptan.29,30 Further studies are needed to 
identify the factors predicting the response to tolvaptan in the 
acute phase of AHF.
Conclusions
In addition to conventional HF therapy, early administration of 
tolvaptan might prevent the exacerbation of AKI and improve 
the prognosis in patients with AHF.
