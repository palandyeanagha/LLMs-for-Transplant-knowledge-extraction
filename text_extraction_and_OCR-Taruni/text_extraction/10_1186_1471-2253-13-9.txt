Abstract
Background: Sodium nitroprusside (SNP) is a potent vasodilator that has been used to induce deliberate
hypotension in children during surgery involving significant blood loss, including craniofacial and spinal fusion
procedures. SNP metabolism liberates cyanide, which may cause interference with cellular energy metabolism,
leading to metabolic acidosis and central nervous system injury. We performed a retrospective, case–control study
to determine whether the short-term intra-operative use of SNP for deliberate hypotension is associated with
metabolic acidosis in children undergoing surgical procedures for craniofacial or spinal anomalies. Cyanide and
thiocyanate concentrations were also recorded in patients who received SNP.
Methods: Data from 166 children undergoing craniofacial and spinal fusion surgery between 2005 and 2010 at
Lucile Packard Children's Hospital (LPCH) at Stanford were analyzed. Records from 60 patients who received SNP
(SNP group) as part of a multicenter, randomized, double-blind study were compared with records from 106
eligible patients who had blood pressure reduction using anesthetic agents and did not receive SNP (control
group). Metabolic acidosis was defined as serum bicarbonate (HCO3) < 18.5 mEq/L. Whole blood CN, plasma
thiocyanate and urinary thiocyanate concentrations were measured in patients in the SNP group. Differences in
metabolic acidosis rates between the SNP and control groups were assessed through a test of noninferiority in the
rate for the SNP group with a noninferiority threshold of 0.2. A z-test was used to test the null hypothesis. The
alternative hypothesis was that the difference in these rates was less than 0.2. The same noninferiority threshold
of 0.2 was also used to perform separate, secondary tests for noninferiority in the proportion of patients with HCO3
levels below 18.5 mEq/L and the proportion of patients who required HCO3 administration.
Results: Fewer patients in the SNP group experienced metabolic acidosis compared to the control group (31.7% vs.
36.8%, respectively; p < .001). No whole blood CN levels above the lower limit of quantification were detected in
any of the 51 patients with validated CN data. Plasma and urinary thiocyanate levels were also low.
Conclusions: Our findings suggest that SNP, when used for short-term deliberate hypotension, does not cause an
increased incidence of metabolic acidosis compared with the use of anesthetic agents alone.

Background
Sodium nitroprusside (SNP) is a potent vasodilator that
has been used to induce deliberate hypotension in chil￾dren during surgery involving significant blood loss, in￾cluding craniofacial and spinal fusion procedures. The
benefits of SNP include rapid onset and offset, i.e.
titratability. A potential drawback of SNP is that its me￾tabolism results in the liberation of cyanide ions (CN).
Cyanide, in turn, may cause interference with cellular en￾ergy metabolism, leading to metabolic acidosis and cen￾tral nervous system injury. Infants and children treated
with SNP may be at increased risk for toxicity due to im￾mature enzyme systems or lack of thiosulfate stores, as
thiosulfate is important in the detoxification of CN via
conversion to thiocyanate (Figure 1) [1]. Signs of cyanide
toxicity, including delirium, weakness, vomiting and coma,
may be masked by general anesthesia. Although data de￾scribing the relationship between SNP and metabolic acid￾osis during anesthesia are limited, concern of the
development of metabolic acidosis due to cyanide toxicity
may decrease the use of SNP during general anesthesia.
We performed a retrospective case–control study to
determine whether the short-term intra-operative use of
SNP for deliberate hypotension is associated with meta￾bolic acidosis in children undergoing craniofacial or
spinal surgery. Cyanide and thiocyanate concentrations
were also recorded in patients who received SNP.
Methods
After approval from the Institutional Review Board was
obtained, data from 166 children undergoing craniofacial
and spinal fusion surgery between 2005 and 2010 at Lucile
Packard Children’s Hospital (LPCH) at Stanford were ana￾lyzed. Records from 60 patients at LPCH who received
SNP (SNP group) as part of a multicenter, randomized,
double-blind study were compared with historical re￾cords from 106 eligible patients who had blood pressure
reduction using anesthetic agents and did not receive
SNP (control group). The degree of blood pressure reduc￾tion for each patient was determined by their anesthesia
care providers.
Patients in the SNP treatment group were treated as
part of the protocol NICHD-2003-09-DR. All patients
treated at LPCH who met the eligibility requirements
were included in this analysis. Enrollment for this study
began on August 3, 2005, and the last participant com￾pleted on January 10, 2008. Per protocol, patients were
randomized to receive 30 minutes of blinded SNP infu￾sion at 0.3, 1, 2, or 3 mcg/kg/min following initial
stabilization of anesthesia. Open-label drug administra￾tion was initiated at the completion of the blinded infu￾sion, during which time SNP was titrated to achieve a
MAP lower than baseline determined by the investigator.
Minimum values for MAP were 50 mmHg for patients
> 1 month of age and 40 mmHg for neonates. The open￾label phase was completed when the need for blood pres￾sure control or general anesthesia was terminated.
Data for patients in the control group were collected
retrospectively related to surgeries performed from May
18, 2005 to January 22, 2010. All data were procured from
the LPCH electronic medical records system following
completion of enrollment in the SNP group. Data included

demographics, anesthesia records (including intravenous
fluids, estimated blood loss and volume of blood adminis￾tered as packed red blood cells) and laboratory results.
Patients eligible for this analysis had corrective surgery
for diagnoses of craniosynostosis or scoliosis. Inclusion
criteria also included weight ≥ 3 kg and age < 17 years at
the time of surgery. Patients were excluded from the con￾trol group if they received SNP during or within 6 hours
after the surgical procedure. Additional inclusion criteria
for the NICHD-2003-09-DR protocol were that neonates
needed to be full-term gestation, participants needed to
require pharmacologically-induced hypotension for acute
blood pressure management during surgery, the duration
of controlled hypotension was expected to be at least 2
hours, the participant required general anesthesia with
endotracheal intubation or IV sedation without endo￾tracheal intubation, and informed consent was required
from the parent or legal guardian and, when appropriate,
the participant. Additional exclusion criteria for the
NICHD-2003-09-DR protocol were a known allergy to
SNP, mitochondrial cytopathy with a disorder of oxidative
phosphorylation or respiratory chain enzymes, a contra￾indication to vasodilator therapy for blood pressure con￾trol, a positive screening urine or serum HCG result,
participation in clinical trials within 30 days before enroll￾ment, a serious medical condition which would interfere
with study procedures, or likely death within 48 hours.
Metabolic acidosis was defined as serum bicarbonate
(HCO3) < 18.5 mEq/L as measured by arterial blood gas
tension analysis and/or administration of HCO3 during
anesthesia. Patients in the SNP group had arterial blood gas
tensions recorded hourly (± 10 minutes) after the initiation
of SNP administration or when an adverse event was ob￾served. Patients in the control group did not have regular
arterial blood gas sampling; serum bicarbonate values for
all samples measured in the control group were evaluated.
Patients were removed from the analysis if no HCO3 mea￾surements were recorded during anesthesia administration.
Historical records from 126 patients who satisfied the
inclusion and exclusion criteria were screened for inclu￾sion in the control group. This number corresponded to
the time frame we chose (2005–10), bracketing enroll￾ment of treatment group patients, that we anticipated
would be needed in order to be left with a sufficient
number of control patients once those in whom no bi￾carbonate was checked or administered were excluded.
After eliminating patients in whom HCO3 was not mea￾sured during anesthesia, 106 of 126 screened patients
were included in the control group for this analysis.
Eighty participants were treated with SNP at LPCH
under the NICHD-2003-09-DR protocol. Twenty of
these 80 participants were excluded from the SNP treat￾ment group for this analysis since they were treated for
conditions unrelated to scoliosis or craniosynostosis.
Differences in metabolic acidosis rates between the SNP
and control groups were assessed through a test of
noninferiority in the rate for the SNP group. A noninferiority
threshold of 0.2 was chosen before retrospective data for the
control group were collected. A z-test was used to test the
null hypothesis that the metabolic acidosis rate for the SNP
group was at least 0.2 greater than the rate in the control
group. The alternative hypothesis was that the difference in
these rates was less than 0.2. The same noninferiority thresh￾old of 0.2 was also used to perform separate, secondary tests
for noninferiority in the proportion of patients with HCO3
levels below 18.5 mEq/L and the proportion of patients who
required sodium bicarbonate administration.
In addition, two-sided tests were performed to assess dif￾ferences in demographic, baseline, and operative charac￾teristics between the SNP and control groups. Fisher’s
exact tests were used for categorical variables, and the
nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test was used for continu￾ous variables. No multiplicity adjustment was performed.
The study was originally powered to have 80% power
with 125 participants in the control group and a true
metabolic acidosis rate above 42%. This power calculation
used the assumption that data from 77 patients would be
included in the SNP group and that the metabolic acidosis
rate is 44% in this group. Thus, the sample sizes used in
the analysis are less than the sizes suggested by the power
calculation. However, as seen in the results section, the ob￾served metabolic acidosis rates in both groups were con￾siderably lower than the assumed rates.
Data for the control group were collected beyond the
January 8, 2008 end of enrollment in the SNP group in
order to achieve 80% power. Thirty-eight (36%) of the 106
patients in the control group had surgery after enrollment
in the control group closed.
Blood samples used to determine whole blood CN and
plasma thiocyanate concentrations for the SNP group
were scheduled to be drawn once before SNP infusion
began, once after SNP administration was terminated, and
up to four times during SNP administration. Urinary thio￾cyanate measurements were also performed from samples
obtained every 4 hours after SNP was initiated. Maximum
CN and thiocyanate concentrations are summarized. Nine
of the 60 patients did not have usable cyanide or thiocyan￾ate concentrations due to initial use of an assay that could
not be validated.
Patient characteristics and operative information
As shown in the demographic summary in Table 1, the
SNP group consisted of 40 patients undergoing craniofacial
surgery (66.7%) and 20 patients having spinal fusion surgery
(33.3%). In the control group, 71 patients underwent cra￾niofacial surgery (67.0%) and 35 (33.0%) had spinal fusion
surgery. Average durations of anesthesia for the SNP and
control groups were 327 and 309 minutes, respectively.
Hammer et al. BMC Anesthesiology 2013, 13:9 Page 3 of 8
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2253/13/9

Demographic characteristics were similar between the two
treatment groups.
A summary of anesthetic agents administered according
to treatment group is shown in Table 2. Fifty percent of
patients in the SNP group received isoflurane compared to
53.8% in the control group. The proportion of patients re￾ceiving various intravenous anesthetic agents showed con￾siderable differences between groups. Because there was
no standardization of anesthetic technique in the control
group, these differences are due to variability in the prefe￾rences of the anesthesia providers caring for each patient.
Table 3 summarizes the total amount of SNP adminis￾tered over the course of the study in mcg/kg, the average
SNP infusion rate in mcg/kg, and the duration of infu￾sion for patients in the SNP group. The mean total ad￾ministered dose was 124.7 mcg/kg with a large standard
deviation (114.3). The lowest total dose was 0.9 mcg/kg
in a patient that was on SNP for 9 minutes, although no
other participant had a total dose below 12.7 mcg/kg.
The mean duration of infusion was 139.5 minutes with a
standard deviation of 65.4 minutes. The maximum dur￾ation of infusion was 339 minutes. The average infusion
rate was determined by dividing the total administered
dose by the infusion duration. The mean of these rates
was 0.9 mcg/kg/min. The maximum average infusion rate
was 2.9 mcg/kg/min. During open-label drug administra￾tion, three participants received SNP at infusion rates that
exceeded 3 mcg/kg/min, which was the highest infusion
rate used during the blinded phase. The highest infusion
rate used during the open-label portion of the study was
4.5 mcg/kg/min. One patient was administered SNP at
this rate for 23 minutes.
Results
Blood loss and IV fluid and blood administration
There was no statistically significant difference in blood
loss or IV fluid volume administered between the two
groups. The average volume of blood administered was
significantly greater in the SNP group (17.8 ± 2.0 mL/kg)
compared to the control group (11.4 ± 1.3 ml/kg) (p<0.01)
(Table 4).
Metabolic acidosis
As shown in Table 5, fewer patients in the SNP group expe￾rienced metabolic acidosis compared to the control group
(31.7% vs. 36.8%, respectively; p < .001). The 95% confi￾dence interval for the difference between these percentages
is (−22%, 11%). Many of the cases of metabolic acidosis in
the control group were identified through HCO3 admini￾stration. A higher percentage of participants in the control
group received HCO3 during anesthesia (30.2% compared
to 16.7% in the SNP group).
More patients in the SNP group than in the control
group had recorded HCO3 levels below 18.5 mEq/L
(26.7% compared to 15.1%). However, the test for
noninferiority does not show that the proportion in the
SNP group is significantly greater (p-value = 0.423). Also,
participants in the SNP group tended to have more collected
HCO3 measurements than participants in the control group.
The median number of collected measurements was 5 (lower

(lower quartile = 2).
Also, 16 (42%) of the 38 patients in the control group
who had surgery after the SNP study had closed in January
2008 had MA. This percentage was slightly higher than
the percentage (34%) of the 68 patients in the overall con￾trol group with MA and surgery before 2008.
In order to explore whether patients in the SNP group
who received higher average SNP infusion rates or
higher total amounts of SNP were more likely to have
experienced metabolic acidosis, the duration of SNP ad￾ministration and average infusion rate until either meta￾bolic acidosis was first identified or the end of study
were examined (Figure 2). Patients are identified in the
plot as either having or not having metabolic acidosis.
There is not a strong relationship between dose and
metabolic acidosis. One (33.3%) of the 3 patients with an
average infusion rate greater than 2 mcg/kg/min experi￾enced metabolic acidosis. Seven (36.8%) of the 19 pa￾tients with an infusion rate greater than 1 mcg/kg/min
experienced metabolic acidosis. Both percentages are
similar to the metabolic acidosis rates in either the over￾all SNP group or the control group.
Cyanide and thiocyanate levels
Fifty-one of the 60 patients included in the primary
metabolic acidosis analysis from the SNP group had
analyzable CN records. No whole blood CN levels above
the lower limit of quantification were detected in any of
the 51 patients. Thiocyanate levels were also low. The
maximum recorded urine thiocyanate level was 8.2 mcg/
mL, and 37 (66%) of the 56 patients with validated urine
thiocyanate measurements had levels that were below
the lower limit of quantification. The maximum post￾dose plasma thiocyanate level was 3.9 mcg/mL, but the
greatest recorded increase from the baseline level was
only 1.5 mcg/mL (Table 6).
Discussion
We performed a case-controlled, retrospective study to
evaluate the incidence of metabolic acidosis in children
undergoing major surgery and deliberate hypotension
with and without SNP. Our findings suggest that, when
used for short-term deliberate hypotension, SNP does
not cause an increased incidence of metabolic acidosis
compared with the use of anesthetic agents alone.
Sodium nitroprusside (SNP) was first discovered in
1850. Its hypotensive effect was reported in 1929, and its
first therapeutic use was reported by Page et al. in 1955
[3]. Moraca et al. first described the clinical use of SNP for
deliberate hypotension during surgical procedures in 1962
[4]. Since then, SNP has been widely used to control blood
pressure in infants and children in the perioperative
period.
SNP is a direct-acting vasodilator with a rapid onset of
action and rapid offset. Its effect is achieved via release of
nitric oxide, thereby activating guanylate cyclase, leading
to an increase in intracellular concentrations of cyclic
guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). cGMP, in turn, in￾hibits calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum,
resulting in smooth muscle relaxation and vasodilation.
The metabolism of each molecule of SNP results in the
liberation of 5 CN molecules (Figure 1). The blood concen￾tration of CN is proportional to the total dose and rapidity
of administration of SNP. The CN produced by metabo￾lism of SNP may (1) be converted to thiocyanate in the
presence of thiosulfate by the rhodanese system, (2) com￾bine with methemoglobin to produce cyanomethemoglobin
or (3) bind with cytochrome oxidase. Binding to cyto￾chrome oxidase is increased when depletion of thiosulfate

or rhodanese occurs, resulting in interference with electron
transport and oxidative phosphorylation. The latter effect
leads to cellular hypoxia, use of anaerobic metabolic path￾ways and metabolic acidosis due to the production of lactic
acid [5]. Increases in CN have been associated with SNP
infusion rates > 2 mcg/kg/min. [6,7]. Co-administration
of thiosulfate with SNP may prevent CN toxicity; thio￾sulfate has been co-infused with SNP during deliberate
hypotension, although this practice is not routine in most
centers3 [8]. Deaths have been attributed to CN toxicity in
children when high doses of SNP have been administered
for relatively prolonged periods, but the total dose per unit
of time that may be lethal is unknown [9]. It is likely that
the use of SNP has been limited because of the assumed
association between its use and CN toxicity leading to pro￾gressive metabolic acidosis. Accordingly, other hypotensive
agents that may be more expensive and less readily titrated
than SNP have been used. Until now, no studies with large
numbers of patients have been conducted to determine the
incidence of metabolic acidosis with intra-operative use of
SNP in children.
Yaster et al. compared the efficacy of SNP to nitroglycer￾ine (NTG) in a group of 14 children, ages 9 to 14 years,
undergoing craniofacial or spinal fusion surgery [10]. NTG
in doses as high as 40 mcg/kg/min was ineffective at de￾creasing mean arterial pressure (MAP) below 55 mmHg
or causing a decrease in MAP greater than one-third of
baseline values. SNP was uniformly successful at inducing
hypotension in all patients, including those patients in
whom NTG failed. The dose of SNP required to induce
hypotension was 6–8 mcg/kg/min. The authors concluded
that SNP is preferred for “the reliable and sustained induc￾tion of deliberate hypotension in children and adolescents.”
Przybylo et al. reported the use of SNP during
hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass in 10 children,
ages 1–7 years [11]. SNP was titrated during bypass to
maintain a MAP of 35–60 mmHg. The mean dose was
6.0 ± 2.5 mcg/kg/min and the median duration of infusion
was 75 min (± 15–90). Blood samples were obtained for
whole blood CN and serum thiocyanate concentrations at
baseline, every 15 minutes during infusion and up to 24
hours post-infusion. Maximum CN concentrations of ≥ 1
mcg/ml were measured in 2 children, 4 children had max￾imum values between 0.5 and 1 mcg/ml and CN was not
detected in the remaining 4 children. The CN assay tech￾nique employed in this study and the accuracy of the re￾sults has been questioned [12]. No patient had a
significant increase in thiocyanate concentration. Arterial
blood gas analysis was performed every 30 minutes during
the SNP infusion. No child developed metabolic acidosis,
although HCO3 1.8 – 4.6 mEq/kg was added to the cardio￾pulmonary bypass prime (i.e. prior to SNP administration
and blood gas tension recordings) and additional doses of
HCO3 were given during cardiopulmonary bypass.
Hersey et al. compared SNP and nicardipine infusions
during deliberate hypotension for spinal fusion surgery
in 20 healthy adolescents [13]. Patients were anesthe￾tized with isoflurane and sufentanil and the study drug
was titrated to achieve a MAP of 60 mmHg. Hemodilu￾tion to a hematocrit of 25% and intraoperative blood sal￾vage were used. Patients receiving nicardipine had less
blood loss than those receiving SNP (761 ± 199 mL vs.
1,297 ± 264 mL, respectively) and had a longer time
to restoration of baseline MAP following discontinu￾ation of the study infusion (26.8 ± 4.0 min vs. 7.3 ±
1.1 min, respectively). There were no differences in the
amount of IV fluids administered or urine output be￾tween the two groups. CN concentrations were not
measured and the incidence of metabolic acidosis was
not reported. Lustik et al. conducted a similar study
comparing SNP and nicardipine for deliberate hypo￾tension in 51 adolescents undergoing spinal surgery
and found no difference in blood loss between the
groups [14].

There are limitations in each of these studies of SNP.
The numbers of patients are small and the incidence of
metabolic acidosis is not reported or, in the study by
Przybylo et. al., may be masked by the prior administra￾tion of HCO3. Our study is relatively large but also has
several limitations. As in prior studies, the anesthetic
agents and doses as well as the volume of IV fluids were
not controlled. Targets for MAP were not defined, but
rather were determined at the discretion of the anesthe￾siologist caring for each patient. These parameters are
difficult or impossible to control well even in prospect￾ive studies due to the overriding concern for patient
safety and lack of evidence for the most appropriate
endpoints. In part due to the retrospective nature of
our study, measurement of arterial blood gas tensions
was not performed at pre-defined time points. In
the control group, HCO3 was administered in some
cases prior to the measurement of arterial blood gas
tensions.
Conclusion
We performed a case-controlled, retrospective study
of 166 children to evaluate the incidence of metabolic
acidosis in children undergoing major surgery and
deliberate hypotension with and without SNP. The
proportion of patients with low HCO3 levels was
similar in the control and SNP treatments groups.
More patients in the control group needed to have
HCO3 administered while on anesthesia. No patient to
whom SNP was administered had CN levels above the
lower limit of quantification, and both plasma and urine
thiocyanate concentrations were low. We found no

difference in blood loss or IV fluid administration be￾tween the two groups, although more blood was admin￾istered to patients in the SNP group. Our findings
suggest that SNP, when used for short-term deliberate
hypotension, does not cause an increased incidence of
metabolic acidosis compared with the use of anesthetic
agents alone.
