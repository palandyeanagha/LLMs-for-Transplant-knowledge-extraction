Abstract
Klotho (KL) expression is down-regulated in the renal tissues of chronic kidney disease (CKD) animal models and
patients with end-stage renal disease. The putative role of KL promoter hypermethylation in the progression of CKD
remains unclear. The present study aimed to determine renal and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) levels
of KL promoter methylation and analyze their relationship with clinical and histological severity in patients with CKD.
Using bisulfite pyrosequencing, renal and PBMC levels of KL promoter methylation were quantified in 47 patients
with CKD. 47 nephrectomy specimens of patients with renal cell carcinoma and 48 PBMC specimens of healthy
volunteers were used as renal tissue and PBMC controls, respectively. Renal expression of KL protein was assayed
by immunohistochemistry staining. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to identify the optimal
cut-off value of PBMC KL promoter methylation level for renal KL promoter hypermethylation. Higher levels of KL
promoter methylation were observed in renal tissue and PBMC in patients with CKD compared with controls
(8.79±3.24 vs. 5.17±1.11%, P<0.001; 7.20±2.79 vs. 3.27±0.79%, P<0.001). In these patients, renal KL methylation
level correlated inversely with renal KL immunostaining intensity (ρ=-0.794, P<0.001). Estimated glomerular filtration
rate correlated inversely with renal and PBMC levels of KL promoter methylation (r=-0.829, P<0.001; r=-0.645,
P<0.001), while tubulointerstistial fibrosis score correlated positively (ρ=0.826, P<0.001; ρ=0.755, P<0.001). PBMC
KL promoter methylation level correlated positively with renal KL promoter methylation level in patients with CKD
(r=0.787, P<0.001). In ROC curve, the area under curve was 0.964 (P<0.001) and the optimal cut-off value was
5.83% with a sensitivity of 93.8% and specificity of 86.7% to predict renal KL promoter hypermethylation. The degree
of KL promoter methylation is associated with clinical and histological severity of CKD. PBMC KL promoter
methylation level may act as a potential biomarker of renal KL promoter hypermethylation.

Introduction
Klotho (KL) is an antiaging gene, which encodes a single￾pass transmembrane protein that forms a complex with multiple
fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) receptors. KL is most
abundant in the renal tubules [1]. KL knockout mice (KL-
/
-
)
develop a syndrome resembling patients with chronic kidney
disease (CKD), such as shortened lifespan,
hyperphosphatemia, and multiple accelerated age-related
disorders including diffusive artery calcification [2]. Recent
studies have shown that KL could function as a renoprotective
factor [3,4]. KL expression is decreased in the renal tissues of
CKD animal models and patients with end-stage renal disease
[3,5]. KL expression can be inhibited by chronic circulating
stress factors, including oxidative stress, inflammation, uremic
toxins and disordered metabolic conditions which are common
in uremic status [6].
Sun et al [7] demonstrated that the two protein-bound uremic
toxins, namely indoxyl sulfate (IS) and p-cresyl sulfate (PCS),
could accelerate kidney fibrosis by decreasing KL expression in
renal tubules of uninephrectomized B-6 mice via CpG
hypermethylation of the KL gene. Specific inhibition of
deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methyltransferase isoform 1 by 5-
aza-2’-deoxycytidine could cause demethylation of the KL gene
and increase its expression [7]. Thus, inhibition of KL gene
expression correlates with gene hypermethylation, suggesting
that epigenetic modification of KL gene may be an important
pathological mechanism of uremia [7]. However, the putative

role of KL promoter hypermethylation in the progression of
CKD is still not clear. Meanwhile, it has been reported that
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of patients with
CKD present a global DNA hypermethylation characteristics
[8]. However, the existence of PBMC KL promoter
hypermethylation in patients with CKD still remains unclear. In
the present study, the renal and PBMC levels of KL promoter
methylation were estimated and the relationship of KL promoter
methylation levels with clinical and histological severity in
patients with CKD was analyzed.
Materials and Methods
Subjects
The study was approved by the Clinical Research Ethical
Committee of Zhongshan Hospital, Shanghai Medical College,
Fudan University. All patients provided written informed
consent. The present study enrolled 47 patients with CKD, who
were aged between 18 and 75 years old and selected for renal
biopsy at the Department of Nephrology, Zhongshan Hospital
of Fudan University, Shanghai, China between April and
October 2012. Blood pressure of all patients was lower than
140/90mmHg. Patients with autoimmune diseases, vasculitis,
diabetes mellitus, liver cirrhosis, heart failure, acute coronary
syndrome, stroke, chronic infectious disease, malignant tumor,
previous dialysis, organ transplantation, rapid deterioration of
renal function in 3 months prior to the study, smoking habit and
previous glucocorticoid or immunosuppressant treatment were
excluded. Clinical data including serum creatinine and 24-hour
urinary protein excretion rate were recorded at the time of renal
biopsy. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was
calculated using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease
formula (eGFR=175 x standardized serum creatinine-1154. x
age-0.203 x 0.741 [if Asian] x 0.742 [if female]) [9]. Additionally,
the normal renal cortex from the nephrectomy specimen of 47
age- and sex-matched patients with renal cell carcinoma (all
clear cell type) and PBMC from 48 age- and sex-matched
healthy subjects were considered as renal tissue and PBMC
controls, respectively.
Sample preparation and DNA extraction
Renal biopsy samples were obtained under ultrasound
guidance with a 16-gauge needle. All renal tissues were
evaluated by standard light microscopy to ensure that
specimens were mainly renal cortex and had at least ten
glomeruli. The microscopic procedure also confirmed that only
the normal renal cortex was used as renal tissue control. Only
those biopsies, which provided a sufficient sample for
performing both the standard pathologic examination and
molecular biology analysis, were considered for this study.
After renal biopsy, the specimens were immediately frozen in
liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C until further processing.
Venous blood sample (10ml) was collected in
ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid tubes at 4°C before extraction.
PBMC were isolated by density gradient centrifugation with
Ficoll-Paque Plus (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, USA) as briefly
described below. Blood sample was mixed with phosphate
buffered saline (PBS) and transferred into a tube containing
Ficoll-Paque. After 30 min of centrifugation at 2000 rpm at
18°C, the PBMC layer was extracted, washed twice with
Hank's Balanced Salt Solution (Invitrogen, Cergy Pontoise,
France), and resuspended in PBS/fetal bovine serum (FBS)
(PBS with 4% FBS). After isolation, the cell pellets were stored
at -80°C until further processing. Renal tissues and whole
blood DNA were extracted using QIAamp DNA Mini kit
(Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and Qiagen DNA Blood Mini Kit
(Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), respectively; and they were stored
at -80°C until processing for analysis.
DNA methylation analyses by quantitative bisulfite
pyrosequencing
DNA methylation analyses were performed on bisulfite￾treated DNA using a quantitative assay based on polymerase
chain reaction (PCR)-pyrosequencing. Renal tissues and whole
blood DNA were treated with sodium bisulfite using EZ DNA
Methylation-Gold kit (Zymo Research, CA, USA) per
manufacturer's instructions. This process converted all
unmethylated cytosine to uracil, which could be recognized as
thymidine by Taq polymerase; and it did not affect methylated
cytosines. 500 ng of extracted DNA was used for this step. The
bisulfite-treated DNA was amplified using Qiagen PyroMark
PCR Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The locations of CpG sites
that were evaluated in KL were identified as described in
previous reports [7,10]. The methylation percentage of 6 CpG
sites in KL (−432 to −401) was measured (Figure 1) and
hypermethylation of these sites had been reported to silence
gene expression [7]. The PCR products were amplified using
the following primers: F; GTGGGAGAAAAGTGAGAGTAG and
R: AAACCCTCAAATTCATTCTCTTTACCTACC-biotinylated.
The amplification was carried out as follows: denaturation at
94°C for 15 minutes; followed by 35 cycles each at 94°C for 30
seconds, at 58°C for 30 seconds, at 72°C for 300 seconds; and
a final extension at 72°C for 10 minutes. The PCR product was
checked by 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis to confirm the
quality and size of the product and rule out the formation of
primer dimers. The specific PCR products were then subjected
to quantitative pyrosequencing analysis using a PyroMark™
Q96 MD Pyrosequencing System (Qiagen, Germany) per
manufacturer's instructions. The pyrosequencing primer for KL
was AAGTGAGAG TAGGTG. Non-CpG cytosine residues
were used to verify bisulfite conversion. The degree of
methylation in the CpG sites tested is expressed herein as the
percentage of methylated cytosines (mC) over the sum of
methylated and unmethylated cytosine residues. The reported
methylation levels are the averages of 6 CpG sites in KL
(Figure 2). Each marker was pyrosequenced in two replicates,
and the results were averaged. Based on normal samples and
internal quality controls, the cut-off value of renal and PBMC
KL promoter hypermethylation were set at 7.5% and 5.0%,
respectively; and CpG methylation above this limit was
considered as hypermethylated.
Renal KL immunohistochemistry staining
Immunohistochemistry staining for KL was performed using a
biotin-streptavidin-peroxidase method as described in a
previous report [11]. Rabbit anti-human KL (1:100 dilution;

Abcam, Cambridge, UK) and biotinylated goat anti-rabbit
immunoglobulin G were used as primary and secondary
antibodies, respectively. Sections that were incubated with
non-immune rabbit serum instead of the primary antibodies
served as negative controls. All sections were stained under
identical conditions together with control incubation. Nuclei
were counterstained lightly with hematoxylin. The
immunoreactivity for KL was scored in a blind manner as
follows and was compared with the renal KL methylation levels:
0 for none, 1 for mild, 2 for moderate, and 3 for strong
immunostaining.
Assessment of renal tubulointerstitial fibrosis
Analysis of renal tubulointerstitial fibrosis was determined on
2μm paraffin-embedded sections stained by Periodic Acid￾Schiff. The severity of renal tubulointerstitial fibrosis was
scored by an experienced pathologist who was blinded to the
results of molecular biology studies. For tubulointerstitial
lesions, tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis were scored as
follows: 0 for absent, 1 for mild (involving <25% of the
interstitium and tubules), 2 for moderate (involving 25~50% of
the interstitium and tubules), and 3 for intense (involving >50%
of the interstitium and tubules). A final tubulointerstitial fibrosis
(TIF) score was obtained by adding these up and reported
between 0 and 6 [12].
Statistical analysis
All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS (version
17.0, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). All the results were
presented in mean ± SD for normally distributed data, and

median and inter-quartile range for the others. The data of 24-
hour proteinuria and eGFR were log transformed due to the
large range of values. Chi-square test and t test were used for
differences between groups. Correlation was assessed using
Pearson and Spearman analysis. Receiver operator
characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed to assess the
optimal cut-off value of PBMC KL promoter methylation level to
predict the renal KL promoter hypermethylation by calculating
the true positive rate (sensitivity) against the false-positive rate
(1-specificity). Statistical significance was set at P<0.05. All
significance tests were two-tailed.
Results
Characteristics of patients with CKD and controls
The demographic and clinical data of the study subjects are
summarized in Table 1. As compared to renal tissue and
PBMC controls, patients with CKD had significantly higher
levels of urinary protein excretion rate and lower eGFR. There
was no difference in age and gender between patients with
CKD and controls. The underling renal diseases of patients
with CKD were IgA nephropathy (n=22), focal segmental
glomerulosclerosis (n=8), crescentic nephritis (n=7), minor
lesions (n=4), membranous nephropathy (n=4),
membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (n=1), and
hypertensive nephropathy (n=1).
Renal and PBMC levels of KL promoter methylation in
patients with CKD
Among 47 patients with CKD, KL promoter was
hypermethylated in renal tissue of 32 patients (68.09%) and
PBMC of 33 patients (70.21%). KL promoter of renal tissue and
PBMC control showed no characteristics of hypermethylation.
As compared to renal tissue control, patients with CKD had
higher renal level of KL promoter methylation (8.79±3.24 vs.
5.17±1.11%, P<0.001). Similarly, these patients had higher
PBMC level of KL promoter methylation than PBMC control
(7.20±2.79 vs. 3.27±0.79%, P<0.001). Figure 3 summarized
the comparison of methylation level between the patients with
CKD, renal tissue control, and PBMC control, which were
analyzed for the individual CpG islands of KL. The difference
was statistically significant for all 6 CpG sites (p < 0.001).
Correlation between renal KL methylation level and
renal KL immunostaining intensity
Immunohistochemistry staining of KL was performed using a
biotin-streptavidin-peroxidase method to examine correlation
between the level of renal KL methylation and renal Klotho
protein expression. This was performed in consecutive kidney

sections obtained from patients with CKD. Representative
pictures of KL immunostaining are shown in Figure 4. KL
staining was detected mainly in the renal tubules. Renal KL
methylation level correlated inversely with renal KL
immunostaining intensity (ρ=-0.794, P<0.001) (Figure 4).

In all the 47 patients with CKD, the renal level of KL promoter
methylation correlated inversely with eGFR (r=-0.829, P<0.001)
and correlated positively with TIF score (ρ=0.826, P<0.001)
(Figure 5). PBMC level of KL promoter methylation also
correlated inversely with eGFR (r=-0.645, P<0.001) and
correlated positively with TIF score (ρ=0.755, P<0.001) (Figure
5). No correlation was demonstrated between 24-hour
proteinuria and renal or PBMC level of KL promoter
methylation.
Correlation between renal and PBMC levels of KL
promoter methylation in patients with CKD
PBMC level of KL promoter methylation correlated positively
with renal level of KL promoter methylation (r=0.787, P<0.001)
in all the 47 patients with CKD (Figure 6). The ability of PBMC
KL promoter methylation level to predict renal KL promoter
hypermethylation was assessed. ROC curve had a highly
significant area under curve (AUC) (0.964, P<0.001). The
optimal cut-off value for renal KL promoter hypermethylation
showed a PBMC KL promoter methylation level of 5.83%. The
best combination of sensitivity and specificity was 93.8% and
86.7%, respectively (Figure 7).
Discussion
KL is originally identified as an aging suppressor [2]. Klotho
is expressed widely, but it is most abundant in the kidney
[13,14]. Renal KL messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) was
found to be lower in a 5/6 nephrectomy model and in
nephrectomy samples from patients with end-stage renal
disease [5,15,16]. A modest amelioration of proteinuria and

renal function were observed when KL was overexpressed
genetically in the chronic glomerulonephritis model [3] or via
viral delivery in the chronic angiotension ii hypertension model
[17]. The same observations were also made in the
spontaneous hypertension model [18]. In a recent study, KL
was notably decreased in kidney and barely detectable in the
blood and urine of CKD model generated using
uninephrectomy plus ischemia-reperfusion injury in
contralateral kidney [19]. Patients with various stages of CKD
had lower levels of KL in their blood and urine. The magnitude
of decrease could correlate with the severity of decline in eGFR
[19-21]. All these review of literature could suggest that CKD is
a state of KL deficiency. The clear mechanism involved in the
decrease of KL expression in kidney diseases is presently
unknown, but this may potentially include ischemia, oxidative
stress, uremic toxins, inflammation, and disordered metabolic
conditions [6,13,22-24]. Sun et al [7] demonstrated inhibition of
KL gene expression by IS and PCS. Such an inhibition
correlated with gene hypermethylation, suggesting that
epigenetic modification of KL gene might be an important
mechanism for KL deficiency. However, the KL promoter
methylation level in patients with CKD remains unknown, and
the contribution of KL promoter hypermethylation to the
progression of CKD are currently still not clear.
The present study reported the elevation of both renal and
PBMC levels of KL promoter methylation in patients with CKD.
Renal KL methylation level correlated inversely with renal KL
protein expression. The study also demonstrated correlations
of renal and PBMC levels of KL promoter methylation with
eGFR and histological damage in patients with CKD,
suggesting a possible participation of KL promoter
hypermethylation in the pathophysiology of CKD. Many
mammalian gene promoters are rich in CpG dinucleotide
clusters known as CpG islands [25]. Covalent addition of a
methyl group to the 5-carbon position of the cytosine is
common throughout the genome, but when added to CpG
dinucleotides in promoter region, CpG islands generally leads
to loss of the associated gene expression [26]. KL promoter
hypermethylation can lead to decreased expression of KL
protein. The mechanisms by which KL protects kidney from
injury include antioxidation, antiapoptosis [23,24], and
antisenescence [3]. It was believed that KL functioned mainly, if
not uniquely, as a coreceptor for FGF23 binding to FGF
receptor 1. FGF23 signal transduction generally requires
transmembrane KL as a coreceptor [27,28]. Patients with CKD

have a high level of full length FGF23 and upregulation of this
signal pathway [29]. It is possible that part of the beneficial
effects of KL on kidney in CKD may result from the
improvement in FGF23 signal transduction [19]. KL promoter
hypermethylation has a potential clinical significance. First, KL
promoter hypermethylation can serve as an early and sensitive
biomarker of CKD. Secondly, therapy with a demethylating
agent may be in the horizon in slowing the progression of CKD.
In a previous study, PBMC gene methylation level was
demonstrated as a potential noninvasive biomarker of
malignant tumor [30], but no data was available about the
PBMC methylation level of specific gene in kidney disease. The
present study provided an evidence for the correlation of
PBMC levels of KL promoter methylation with eGFR and
histological damage in CKD patients. ROC curve of PBMC KL

promoter methylation level to predict renal KL promoter
hypermethylation had an AUC of 0.964, and the optimal cut-off
value was found to be 5.83% with a high sensitivity and
specificity. All these data suggested that PBMC KL promoter
methylation level might be a potential noninvasive biomarker of
renal KL promoter hypermethylation. Progressive decline in
renal function is associated with inflammation, augmented
oxidative stress, accumulation of diverse toxins, and deranged
metabolism, all of which could result in altered epigenetic
modifications [31]. Hence, it could be speculated these chronic
circulating stress factors were involved in PBMC aberrant DNA
methylation in patients with CKD. However, the effect of CKD
on PBMC DNA methylation still requires further exploration.
The main limitations of the present study included the
following: first, renal cortex tissue was used to detect the renal
level of KL promoter methylation without distinguishing
glomeruli and renal tubules; secondly, renal KL mRNA
expression was unable to be detected due to very scarce
samples obtained during renal biopsy and renal KL protein
expression was semi-quantitatively assayed by
immunohistochemistry staining. It is recommended that future
studies should investigate KL promoter methylation level in
glomeruli and renal tubules.

Conclusion
This is the first study to report the pathogenic role of KL
promoter hypermethylation in the progression of CKD. This
study has also provided evidence that PBMC level of KL
promoter methylation closely correlates with renal level of KL
promoter methylation, and it may be used as a potential
biomarker of renal KL promoter hypermethylation. Further
studies are needed to elucidate the utility of KL promoter
methylation level as a marker to predict renal fibrosis and to
explore the therapeutic efficacy of demethylating agent against
the progression of fibrogenesis.
