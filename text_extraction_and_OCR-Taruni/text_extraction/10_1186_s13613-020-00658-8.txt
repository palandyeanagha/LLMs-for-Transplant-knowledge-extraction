Abstract
Background: Loss of vascular tone is a key pathophysiological feature of septic shock. Combination of gradual 
diastolic hypotension and tachycardia could reflect more serious vasodilatory conditions. We sought to evaluate the 
relationships between heart rate (HR) to diastolic arterial pressure (DAP) ratios and clinical outcomes during early 
phases of septic shock.
Methods: Diastolic shock index (DSI) was defined as the ratio between HR and DAP. DSI calculated just before start‑
ing vasopressors (Pre-VPs/DSI) in a preliminary cohort of 337 patients with septic shock (January 2015 to February 
2017) and at vasopressor start (VPs/DSI) in 424 patients with septic shock included in a recent randomized controlled 
trial (ANDROMEDA-SHOCK; March 2017 to April 2018) was partitioned into five quantiles to estimate the relative risks 
(RR) of death with respect to the mean risk of each population (assumed to be 1). Matched HR and DAP subsamples 
were created to evaluate the effect of the individual components of the DSI on RRs. In addition, time-course of DSI 
and interaction between DSI and vasopressor dose (DSI*NE.dose) were compared between survivors and non-survi‑
vors from both populations, while ROC curves were used to identify variables predicting mortality. Finally, as explora‑
tory observation, effect of early start of vasopressors was evaluated at each Pre-VPs/DSI quintile from the preliminary 
cohort.
Results: Risk of death progressively increased at gradual increments of Pre-VPs/DSI or VPs/DSI (One-way ANOVA, 
p<0.001). Progressive DAP decrease or HR increase was associated with higher mortality risks only when DSI concom‑
itantly increased. Areas under the ROC curve for Pre-VPs/DSI, SOFA and initial lactate were similar, while mean arterial 
pressure and systolic shock index showed poor performances to predict mortality. Time-course of DSI and DSI*NE.
dose was significantly higher in non-survivors from both populations (repeated-measures ANOVA, p<0.001). Very 
early start of vasopressors exhibited an apparent benefit at higher Pre-VPs/DSI quintile.
Conclusions: DSI at pre-vasopressor and vasopressor start points might represent a very early identifier of patients 
at high risk of death. Isolated DAP or HR values do not clearly identify such risk. Usefulness of DSI to trigger or to direct 
therapeutic interventions in early resuscitation of septic shock need to be addressed in future studies.

Background
Definition of shock incorporates the presence of low 
arterial pressure in association with abnormalities in tis￾sue perfusion leading to abnormal oxygen metabolism by 
the cells [1]. Because the intimate relationship between 
blood pressure and flow, operational definitions of shock 
include the fall of mean (MAP) and/or systolic arterial

pressure (SAP) [1, 2]. Nevertheless, alterations of pulse 
wave could grossly mirror, in some extend, the underly￾ing mechanisms of acute circulatory failure implied in 
shock. For example, SAP results particularly important 
to define cardiogenic shock [2], hemorrhagic [3] or any 
type of shock with a hypovolemic component, since at 
very early stage of these conditions, SAP and pulse pres￾sure (PP) fall while diastolic arterial pressure tends to be 
sustained. However, hypotension observed during septic 
shock results from a complex interaction between vaso￾dilation, relative and absolute hypovolemia, myocardial 
dysfunction, and altered blood flow distribution [4]. In 
particular, vasodilation resulting from the failure of the 
vascular smooth muscle to constrict is one of the lead￾ing mechanisms associated with hypotension and tissue 
hypoperfusion in septic shock [5]. In these cases, dias￾tolic arterial pressure (DAP) would better reflect vasodi￾lation than SAP or MAP.
In healthy people, DAP is mainly determined by vascu￾lar tone and it remains nearly constant from the ascend￾ing aorta to the peripheral vessels [6]. Thus, detection 
of low DAP at peripheral vessels should reflect systemic 
vasodilation as long as aortic valve is competent. How￾ever, in general, DAP is not considered for definition of 
septic shock, and with few exceptions, its relationship 
with clinical outcomes has not been widely described [7]. 
Important studies in patients with septic shock define 
hypotension in terms of MAP and SAP values [8–10] 
assuming the pivotal role of MAP [11] or SAP, on organ 
perfusion [12–14], in addition to the prognostic value 
of sustained low MAP values [15]. Nevertheless, evalua￾tion of the loss of vascular tone through the severity of 
diastolic hypotension could have profound implications 
on therapeutic decisions since there are not robust clues 
to rapidly predict when hypotension will be sustainably 
corrected with fluid loading. Thus, rapid assessment of 
severity of vasodilation could influence therapeutic deci￾sions such as the early introduction of vasoactive agents 
[16], which theoretically would avoid unnecessary fluid 
administration while promptly restoring tissue perfusion.
Remarkably, DAP should not be evaluated separately 
from heart rate. Acute reductions in arterial pres￾sure are compensated by increased sympathetic activ￾ity, although sometimes such compensation becomes 
maladaptive. This was the original rationale to index￾ing SAP by heart rate (HR) during hemorrhagic shock 
and acute critical illness [17, 18], or indexing MAP by 
HR to detect myocardial hypoperfusion [19]. Likewise, 
as DAP depends on vascular tone and the duration of 
the cardiac cycle [20], a combination of DAP and HR 
could reflect the severity of circulatory dysfunction 
during vasodilatory conditions. Thus, we evaluated the 
relationships between very early HR:DAP ratios (i.e., 
the diastolic shock index, or DSI, calculated just before 
or at the start of vasopressor support) and clinical out￾comes in patients with septic shock, hypothesizing that 
very early DSI values could promptly identify patients 
at high risk of unfavorable outcomes, while persistence 
of high DSI during the first hours of resuscitation could 
reflect more severe cardiovascular dysfunction.
Materials and methods
Study population
A total of 761 patients were analyzed: a preliminary 
cohort of 337 patients with sepsis requiring vasopres￾sor support (January 2015 to February 2017) from one 
mixed-ICU in a university hospital in Colombia (Fun￾dación Valle del Lili, Cali, Colombia) and 424 patients 
with septic shock included in a recent randomized con￾trolled study (March 2017 to April 2018) conducted in 
28 hospitals in 5 countries (Argentina, Chile, Colombia, 
Ecuador, Uruguay), the ANDROMEDA-SHOCK trial 
[21]. The respective ethical and research committee 
involving human beings approved the use of the data 
obtained in both the initial cohort (Protocol number 
1238, IRB/EC approval number 099-2018, Fundación 
Valle del Lili, Cali, Colombia) and the randomized con￾trolled trial [21].
Septic shock was defined in the ANDROMEDA￾SHOCK population according to the Third Interna￾tional Consensus Definitions for Sepsis and Septic 
Shock (Sepsis 3.0), which states septic shock as the 
combination of suspected infection accompanying 
life-threatening organ dysfunction, requirement of 
vasopressor therapy to elevate MAP ≥ 65  mmHg and 
lactate > 2 mmol/L despite adequate fluid resuscitation 
[22]. Meanwhile, patients from the preliminary cohort 
were included under the diagnostic criteria for septic 
shock stated in the Surviving Sepsis Campaign: Inter￾national Guidelines for Management of Severe Sep￾sis and Septic Shock: 2012 [23], based on the previous 
2001 SCCM/ESICM/ACCP/ATS/SIS International Sep￾sis Definitions Conference [24], valid during the period 
in which the database was constructed.
Exclusion criteria for preliminary cohort covered 
patients < 18-year old, pregnant women, patients with 
liver failure (protrombin time > 15  s or international 
normalized ratio ≥ 1.5 and any hepatic encephalopa￾thy), advanced liver cirrhosis (Child–Pugh C), acute/
chronic atrial fibrillation, presence of ventricular 
arrhythmia, use of definitive/transitory pacemaker 
and those with do-not-resuscitate orders. Meanwhile, 
exclusion criteria for the ANDROMEDA-SHOCK pop￾ulation are detailed elsewhere [21].

Study design
DSI was calculated as the quotient between HR and 
DAP registered just before the start of vasopressor ther￾apy (Pre-VPs/DSI) in the preliminary cohort and at the 
randomization point in the ANDROMEDA-SHOCK 
population (<4 h of septic shock diagnosis according to 
inclusion criteria), i.e., VPs/DSI [21]. Then, DSI was sub￾sequently calculated 2, 4, and 8 h after the introduction 
of vasopressor support in both populations. Time elapsed 
from the first hypotension episode and the first fluid load 
with resuscitative intention was registered in the pre￾liminary cohort, while time elapsed from the diagnosis 
of septic shock up to randomization was recorded for the 
ANDROMEDA-SHOCK population. Most of the initial 
measurements (i.e., pre-vasopressor and at the start of 
vasopressor) were obtained by non-invasive techniques 
using an oscillometric brachial cuff, typically in those 
patients admitted from the emergency room and general 
wards. However, invasive pressures were registered later 
on, when an indwelling intra-arterial catheter was placed. 
The volume of resuscitation fluids was registered at Pre￾VPs point, and then, 2, 4 and 8  h after in the prelimi￾nary cohort, and at the VPs/DSI point, and 8 h after in 
the ANDROMEDA-SHOCK population. Meanwhile, net 
fluid balance was recorded at 8 and 24 h after the start of 
vasopressors in both populations. The HR-to-SAP ratio 
[18, 25] was also calculated at same time points. Multi￾ple organ dysfunction was assessed using the Sequential 
Organ Failure Assessment Score (SOFA) [26], while ven￾tilator-free days and requirement of acute renal replace￾ment therapy were also registered.
Finally, as a simple exploratory observation, the effect 
of timing to start vasopressor support was evaluated in 
the preliminary cohort. A very early start of vasopres￾sor was defined as the one started within the first hour of 
receiving the first fluid load with resuscitative intention 
such as it was recently reported [27].
General management
Patients from the preliminary cohort followed an early 
quantitative resuscitation protocol adapted from the 
Surviving Sepsis Campaign [23, 28], aimed in general to 
target (a) MAP≥65  mmHg; (b) urine output>0.5  mL/
kg/h; (c) ScvO2≥70%, when available; (d) normaliza￾tion of lactate levels or decreasing of 20% every-2  h in 
lactate levels. A complete description of the resuscita￾tion protocol and general management in such cohort is 
described elsewhere [29]. Meanwhile, patients collected 
from ANDROMEDA-SHOCK trial were randomly allo￾cated to peripheral perfusion-targeted resuscitation or 
lactate level-targeted resuscitation following a protocol 
described in detail elsewhere [30].
Statistical analysis
First, DSI values, calculated just before the start of vaso￾pressors (Pre-VPs/DSI) in the preliminary cohort or at 
the randomization point (VPs/DSI) in the ANDROM￾EDA-SHOCK population, were partitioned into five 
quantiles to estimate the relative risks (RR) of death in 
relation to the mean risk of their respective population 
(assumed to be 1). The mean risk and 95% confidence 
intervals at each DSI quintile were calculated after 
adjustment for the covariables: age, SOFA score day-1, 
APACHE II, initial arterial lactate, and volume of resus￾citation fluids received before start of vasopressors and 
from vasopressor start up to 8 h after. Then, new parti￾tions were performed aiming to evaluate the effect of 
individual components of Pre-VPs/DSI or VPs/DSI (i.e., 
DAP and HR) on the relative risk of death, as follows: 
(a) into quintiles of progressively higher DAP; (b) into 
quintiles of progressively higher HR; (c) re-stratifying 
each original quintile of DAP into 5 sub-clusters of DSI 
to extract patients with similar DSI values and there￾fore, simultaneous increasing of HR and DAP.
Second, repeated-measures ANOVA were used to 
evaluate differences in the time-course of DSI, mean 
arterial pressure, DAP, HR, pulse pressure, and vaso￾pressor doses between survivors and non-survivors 
at day-90 in both preliminary and ANDROMEDA￾SHOCK populations. Similarly, the time-course of the 
product of DSI and dose of vasopressor (DSI*NE.dose) 
was compared between survivors and non-survivors at 
day-90.
Third, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves 
were used to identify the performance of variables at 
pre-VP point (for preliminary cohort) or at randomiza￾tion point (for ANDROMEDA-SHOCK), and 8 h after, 
to predict mortality at day-28 and 90. Such variables 
were Pre-VPs/DSI (or VPs/DSI, in the case of patients 
from ANDROMEDA-SHOCK), lactate, mean arterial 
pressure, SOFA score, APACHE II, and systolic shock 
index (HR:SAP ratio). In addition, the interaction or 
product of DSI by the dose of vasopressor (DSI*NE.
dose) was also included at points where the patients 
were under vasopressor support.
Fourth, the effect of very early start of vasopressors 
on mortality at day-90 in each quintile of Pre-VPs/DSI 
from the preliminary cohort was evaluated using a Chi 
square test and additionally, logistic regression models 
adjusted by SOFA score and initial lactate at each Pre￾VPs/DSI quintile. A Hosmer and Lemeshow test was 
used to assess the goodness of fit in each model.

Results
A total of 761 patients with septic shock were ana￾lyzed: 337 patients from a preliminary cohort (Addi￾tional file 1: Figure S1a) and 424 from the randomized 
controlled trial ANDROMEDA-SHOCK (Additional 
file  1: Figure S1b). A STROBE statement checklist for 
observational studies is provided in SDC Additional 
file 1: Table S1. Lengths of ICU and hospital stay were 
9 (4–16) and 14 (6–29) days, respectively, in the pre￾liminary cohort, while these were 6 (3–12) and 13 
(6–26) days in the ANDROMEDA-SHOCK. Over￾all mortality at days-28 and 90 were 38.3% and 43.0% 
in the preliminary cohort, and 39.2% and 43.9% in the 
ANDROMEDA-SHOCK. General characteristics of 
both preliminary cohort and ANDROMEDA-SHOCK 
are presented in the Table 1.
Progressive increases in Pre-vasopressor DSI (Pre-VPs/
DSI) or DSI at vasopressor start (VPs/DSI) were related 
with gradual increases in the relative risk of death at 
day-90 in the preliminary and ANDROMEDA-SHOCK 
populations (Fig. 1). Similar HR values were related with 
progressively lower risk of death as long as DAP gradually 
increases, and consequently, DSI values decrease (Fig. 2). 
Likewise, similar DAP values were related with progres￾sively higher risk of mortality as long as HR gradually 
increases, and consequently, DSI also did (Fig.  3). Nev￾ertheless, simultaneous increases in HR and DAP with 
subsequent similar DSI values were related with similar 
risk of death (Additional file  1: Figure S2). A complete 
description for DSI, DAP and HR partitioning is pre￾sented in the Additional file 1: Tables S2, S3. Meanwhile, 
a complete description of general demographics, hemo￾dynamics, lactate, renal replacement and mechanical 
ventilation requirements, resuscitation and cumulative 
fluids according to the Pre-VPs/DSI and VPs/DSI in the 
preliminary cohort and ANDROMEDA-SHOCK popula￾tions are presented in Additional file 1: Tables S4, S5.
There were significant differences in the time-course 
of DSI between survivors and non-survivors at day-90 
in both populations (repeated-measures ANOVA, inter￾subjects difference p<0.001) (Fig. 4). Similarly, the prod￾uct of DSI and dose of norepinephrine (DSI*NE.dose) 
remained significantly high in non-survivors from both 
populations (repeated-measures ANOVA, inter-subjects 
difference p<0.001) (Fig.  4). Time-course of diastolic 
pressure, heart rate, mean arterial pressure, pulse pres￾sure and systolic shock index for survivors and non-sur￾vivors are showed in Additional file 1: Figures S3–S7.
Pre-VPs/DSI from preliminary cohort or VPs/DSI 
from ANDROMEDA-SHOCK depicted similar perfor￾mance to predict mortality at day-28 and 90 than other 
variables such as SOFA score and initial lactate levels 
(Additional file  1: Figure S8a–S9b). Conversely, mean 
arterial pressure or isolated diastolic arterial pressure 
and the systolic shock index showed poor performance 
for such prediction. DSI and DSI*NE.dose at 8 h showed 
again similar performances than SOFA score and lactate 
values, while mean arterial pressure, diastolic arterial 
pressures and the systolic shock index depicted a poor 
performance to predict mortality at day-90 (Additional 
file 1: Figure S8b–S9b).
Very early start of norepinephrine (i.e., norepinephrine 
started within the first hour of the first fluid load with 
resuscitative intention) was related with a lower mortal￾ity in higher Pre-VPs/DSI (i.e., the Pre-VPs/DSI Quin￾tile-5) (Additional file 1: Tables S6, S7).
Discussion
Our study retrieves four important findings: (a) pro￾gressively higher DSI values calculated just before or at 
the start of vasopressors are associated with a gradual 
increase in the risk of death in patients with septic shock; 
(b) isolated low DAP or high HR values do not clearly 
identify such risk; (c) non-survivors evolve with per￾sistently high DSI values while requiring higher doses 
of vasopressors and more resuscitation fluids than sur￾vivors; (d) Pre-VPs/DSI and VPs/DSI showed similar 
performance to SOFA score and initial lactate levels to 
predict mortality, while mean arterial pressure and sys￾tolic shock index did not.
Vasodilation plays a key role in the development of 
hypotension and tissue hypoperfusion in septic shock 
[5]. DAP reflects in part the vascular tone when aortic 
valve is competent. Nevertheless, the duration of the car￾diac cycle, the blood volume ejected to the aorta and the 
arterial compliance also influence DAP [20]. Thus, under 
isovolemic conditions and constant arterial compliance, 
shortening diastolic times are associated with higher 
DAP while a prolonged diastole leads to an opposite 
effect [20]. Consequently, simultaneous and opposite var￾iations in DAP and HR could suggest more severe cardio￾vascular dysfunction, with progressively high HR unable 
to compensate DAP drops as a consequence of gradual 
decrease in vascular tone. Supporting this, our data sug￾gest that such progressively opposite changes in HR and 
DAP represent more severe circulatory dysfunction with 
proportional increases in the relative risk of death.
Persistently low MAP [15, 31] or DAP [7] have been 
related to worse outcomes in septic shock, while new￾onset prolonged sinus tachycardia as a consequence of 
sympathetic activity has been associated with increased 
major cardiovascular events, prolonged length of stay 
[32], and higher mortality rates [33]. Nevertheless, iso￾lated DAP or HR just before or at start of vasopressors 
was not clearly related with mortality in the prelimi￾nary cohort and ANDROMEDA-SHOCK populations.

Indeed, at similar HR or DAP values, the risk of death 
was increased only when DSI concomitantly increased 
(Figs.  2, 3; Additional file  1: Figure S2). In addition, 
MAP, SAP and “systolic shock index” (or, HR:SAP ratio) 
were not related with mortality in both populations 
(Additional file 1: Figures S8, S9). We hypothesized that 
although MAP and SAP are used to operatively define 
septic and another types of shock, initial MAP or SAP 
does not reflect systemic vasodilation, which is a lead￾ing mechanism in septic shock. Although DSI depicted 
a similar AUC–ROC than SOFA score and initial lactate 
levels, DSI could add some practical and valuable infor￾mation about how to intervene the initial hemodynamic 
condition in sepsis.
Progressively high DSI values calculated just before 
and at the start of vasopressor support were related with 
gradual increases in the risk of death. Patients in the 
higher quintiles of pre-VPs/DSI and VPs/DSI required 
more renal replacement therapy, depicted higher lac￾tate values and also showed slower lactate decreases 
over the first 8 h of resuscitation. They also required sig￾nificantly more resuscitation fluids and higher doses of 
Fig. 1 Relative risk of death at day-90 according to pre-vasopressor diastolic shock index (Pre-VPs/DSI) or vasopressor start (VPs/DSI) partitions 
in the preliminary and ANDROMEDA SHOCK populations. Diastolic shock index values obtained from just before the start of vasopressor (in 
preliminary cohort) and at the start vasopressor support (in ANDROMEDA-SHOCK) were partitioned into 5 quantiles (Q1 to Q5). Distribution of 
heart rate (HR) and diastolic pressure (DAP) (top) and their respective diastolic shock index distribution (middle) are presented through the quantile 
distribution. Boxplots (top and middle) delineate the interquartile range, the median is shown as a line in the middle of the box, and tails represent 
the 95% range. Coefficients derived from a logistical regression were used to calculate the cut-off value of the diastolic shock index (DSI) detecting 
the mean risk of mortality of the entire population at 28 days. This point was used as the reference to calculate the adjusted relative risks, in such a 
way that a relative risk of 1 represents the mean risk of the respective population (bottom). The mean risk and 95% confidence interval (error bars 
at the bottom) for each percentile were calculated after multivariate adjustment (Cox proportional-hazards model) for the covariables: age, gender, 
SOFA score day-1, initial arterial lactate and pH, and resuscitation fluids from VP to 8H. The gray zone represents the 95% confidence interval for the 
Cox regression (continuous line) across the complete population, assuming the diastolic shock index as a continuous variable. Note that adjusted 
relative risk of death increases as diastolic shock index also does through the quintile distribution

vasopressors as reflected by the product of DSI and dose 
of norepinephrine (DSI*NE.dose). We hypothesize that 
persistently higher DSI values reflect a lack of vascular 
tone requiring progressively higher doses of vasopres￾sors with an inadequate restoration of tissue perfusion. 
However, the observational nature of our study hinders 
the direct effect of variations in vasopressor dose or fluid 
loading on the DSI since the resuscitation maneuvers in 
each group were guided targeting MAP but not DAP.
All arterial pressure measurements used for DSI cal￾culations in our study were obviously obtained at the 
peripheral circulation (i.e., at brachial, femoral or radial 
sites). Although some disagreement in systolic or mean 
arterial pressure is observed from the ascending aorta to 
the peripheral vessels, DAP remains almost constant [6, 
34], even during experimental endotoxemic conditions 
in which a “vascular tone decoupling” from central-to￾peripheral circulation can occur [35]. Thus, DAP records 
obtained at peripheral circulation closely reflect central 
DAP measurements even during severe inflammatory 
conditions with increased vasodilation and altered arte￾rial compliance. Although it could be argued that inva￾sive vs. non-invasive measurement methods to measure 
arterial pressure could influence our results, the bias for 
DAP measurements is far lower than that observed for 
SAP [36]. Furthermore, although significant differences

tails represent the 95% range. Boxplots/error bars (middle) represent medians and 95% confidence intervals of the diastolic shock index (DSI) at 
each quantile. Relative risks’ distributions (bottom) were calculated as described in Fig. 1. Note that adjusted relative risk of death decreases as DAP 
increases and subsequently DSI decreases, for similar HR values

in SAP or MAP are observed according to if invasive vs. 
non-invasive method are used [36], DAP recordings are 
closer at progressively lower DAP values [35]. Conse￾quently, all these considerations claim against the intro￾duction of considerable errors in DSI calculation when 
using invasive vs. non-invasive DAP values and also favor 
the notion of DSI as a global marker of decreased vascu￾lar tone since DAP is less influenced by the reflection of 
pulse waves.
This study may have some important clinical implica￾tions. It is unlikely that severe hypotension as a result 
of severe vasodilation could be reversed by simple fluid 
administration and instead, unnecessary fluids with 
subsequent harmful accumulation can occur [37, 38]. 
Although also considered as “first line intervention”, 
vasopressors are usually used as a rescue therapy when 
initial fluid administration fails to correct hypotension 
or when arterial pressure is judged to be insufficient to 
ensure an adequate tissue perfusion. Recent experi￾mental and observational data suggest that very early 
start of vasopressor support could be beneficial [27, 39]. 
Nevertheless, there are no clear signals indicating when 
vasopressor support should be started. In this way, very 
early signals of severe vasodilation should alert on its 
possible immediate requirement. Thus, DSI should not 
be interpreted as “another index of death”. Instead, a 
higher DSI value at presentation of severe cases of sep￾sis could identify patients who might benefit from some

very early interventions capable of modifying the course 
of septic shock. Our data suggest some beneficial of very 
early start of vasopressors in patients at the higher pre￾VPs DSI. Nevertheless, sample size and the retrospective 
nature of such observation simply pose a hypothesis to be 
tested in the future.
Our study has several limitations. First, as previously 
mentioned, its retrospective nature might limit the con￾clusions since some confounding factors and poten￾tial bias may not have been controlled. Nevertheless, 
observations from preliminary cohort, corroborated in 
prospectively collected data from a recent randomized 
controlled trial, reinforce the strength of DSI as an early 
identifier of septic patients at high risk of death. Second, 
we did not include a control group of normal subjects, so 
recognizing a DSI cutoff to identify abnormality could 
be misleading. Third, although persistently high DSI val￾ues were consistently observed in non-survivors in both 
the preliminary and ANDROMEDA-SHOCK groups, 
there are no clues about whether it is possible to inter￾vene DSI course or even whether modifying DSI course 
might influence clinical outcomes. Nevertheless, this 
could be an important research question as recent exper￾imental observations suggest that some early therapeutic

interventions might modify the time-course of cardio￾vascular dysfunction in septic shock. Finally, despite the 
apparent plausibility of DSI at very early stages of septic 
shock, our observations are limited to a relative small 
sample of patients. Consequently, the potential util￾ity of DSI in the clinical practice should be additionally 
explored.
Conclusion
DSI calculated just before or at the vasopressor start 
might identify patients with septic shock at high risk of 
death. Isolated DAP or high HR is not clearly related with 
such risk. Whether the DSI could be used as a trigger 
or to direct therapeutic interventions in septic shock or 
sepsis-related cardiovascular dysfunction deserves future 
research efforts.
