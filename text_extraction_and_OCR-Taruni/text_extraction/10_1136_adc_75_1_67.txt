Neonatal cholestasis as the presenting feature in
cystic fibrosis
P Lykavieris, 0 Bernard, M Hadchouel
Abstract
Between 1960 and 1994 cystic fibrosis was
found in nine out of 1474 infants investi￾gated for neonatal cholestasis. Four had
delay in passing meconium. In all patients
cholestatic jaundice was present during
the first 48 hours and in three patients
cholestasis was complete, milmiicking bil￾iary atresia. Serum cholesterol concen￾trations were normal in all but two
children. Sweat chloride was repeatedly
above 95 mmol/l in all instances. Three
children had another condition enhancing
the risk ofcholestasis (a,-antitrypsin defi￾ciency, hypopituitarism, perinatal as￾phyxia, and total parenteral nutrition).
Liver histology displayed portal fibrosis
and inflammation with bile duct prolifera￾tion; mucous plugs in bile ducts were
observed in only one patient. Only one
child died from cirrhosis. These results
indicate that cystic fibrosis is not a major
cause of neonatal cholestasis. However
early signs of intestinal obstruction and
low concentrations of serum cholesterol
may indicate cystic fibrosis, regardless of
liver histology. Neonatal cholestasis has no
prognostic value concerning evolution to
cirrhosis.

fibrosis was provided by at least two ionto￾phoretic sweat tests in each child carried out at
a mean age of 2 months in seven children and
at an age of 3.5 and 12 years respectively in two
other children. Sweat chloride concentrations
were above 95 mmol/l. In the four children
studied more recently, immunoreactive serum
trypsin concentrations were above normal for
the age (range 765-1370 jg/l). Only one child
was screened for mutations and was found to
be homozygous for the haplotypes A-A. An
associated condition particularly enhancing
the risk of cholestasis was present in three chil￾dren: homozygous PiZ a1-antitrypsin defi￾ciency; hypopituitarism due to transection of
pituitary stalk; and perinatal asphyxia requiring
intubation for a few hours and total parenteral
nutrition for one month. Known causes of
neonatal cholestasis were excluded in the other
children. Pregnancies were uneventful. Chil￾dren were delivered at term except for one
born by caesarean section because of fetal dis￾tress at 35 weeks of gestation. Birth weights
ranged from 1730 to 3240 g (mean 2605 g).
The patient with associated hypopituitarism
presented twice with hypoglycaemic seizures.
Five children had early gastrointestinal symp￾toms (table 1): four had delay in passing meco￾nium associated in two children with func￾tional distal intestinal obstruction and one had
vomiting. Peritoneal calcifications were ob￾served on standard abdominal radiographs in
one patient.

The liver is frequently involved in cystic fibro￾sis. The clinical and histopathological features
include cirrhosis, steatosis, biliary stones,
portal hypertension, and neonatal
cholestasis.'' The prevalence of liver involve￾ment in cystic fibrosis has been extensively
studied. Yet, the incidence of cystic fibrosis as a
cause of neonatal cholestasis has not been
determined. There have been a limited number
of reports on children in whom cystic fibrosis
presents as neonatal cholestasis and on the
prognosis of the liver condition. Here we report
on nine infants who were investigated in Bice￾tre Hospital for neonatal cholestasis and cystic
fibrosis over a 34 year period.
Patients and results
From 1960 to 1994, 1474 infants presenting
with cholestatic jaundice were investigated in
our unit. Nine (four boys, five girls) were
suffering from cystic fibrosis. Proof of cystic
PRESENTING SYMPTOMS AND SIGNS
Jaundice was present during the first 48 hours
after birth in all instances. On admission to
Bicetre Hospital (age 15 days to 3 months,
mean 1 month and 20 days) stools remained
persistently acholic, mimicking biliary atresia
in three cases. The liver was enlarged and firm
in all children and the spleen palpable in three.
All children presented height and weight retar￾dation ( range from -1 to -3.5 SD for height
and from - 0.5 to -3 SD for weight ). Total
serum bilirubin concentrations ranged from 70
to 312 jmolll (mean 155 gmol/l), serum
transaminase activity from 1.5 to 4 x N
(N=upper normal limit), serum alkaline phos￾phatase activity from normal to 3.5 x N and
serum y-glutamyltranspeptidase activity from
1.5 to 21 x N in the five children studied. Pro￾thrombin time was normal after parenteral
administration of vitamin K in all patients. In
seven children serum cholesterol concentration
was within normal limits for the age (1.8 to 4.5
mmol/l), and was raised (8 mmol/l) only in one

patient with associated aolantitrypsin defi￾ciency. Standard chest radiographs were nor￾mal on admission. Ultrasonographic studies of
the abdomen showed a small gall bladder in
five children; in three others the gall bladder
was not visible. Needle biopsies were carried
out at ages from 1.5 to 4 months (table 2):
main features included moderate to severe
focal fibrosis, variable portal inflammation, and
some degree of ductular proliferation. Inter￾lobular bile ducts were present. Mucous plugs
in the interlobular bile ducts were seen in only
one case. Lobular abnormalities were most
often moderate consisting of steatosis in one
patient, giant cell transformation in two, and
more severe abnormalities in one patient with
fibrosis and acinar transformation.
OUTCOME
Neonatal jaundice persisted until death in two
children. Patient 4 died at 6 months of age with
pneumococcal meningitis, permanently
acholic stools, progressive malnutrition, and
liver cirrhosis on early postmortem needle liver
biopsy. Patient 5 died of liver failure at age 5
months; necropsy disclosed pancreatic lesions
typical of cystic fibrosis, patent extrahepatic
bile ducts, mucus in the gall bladder, and bile
duct and liver lesions consisting of extensive
lobular and portal fibrosis and ductular prolif￾eration with mucous plugs.
In seven children jaundice resolved by age
1.5 to 6 months (mean 3.5 months) with nor￾mal total serum bilirubin concentrations.
Three of the seven children died of respiratory
failure and malnutrition at ages 3.5, 4, and 19
years respectively. In two of them, hepatome￾galy was still present and liver function tests
were normal in the two patients tested (table
1).The other four are alive age 6 to 10 years
old. At the latest follow up, hepatosplenom￾egaly with portal hypertension was present
only in the patient with al-antitrypsin defi￾ciency; the liver and the spleen were not palpa￾ble in the three others, and abdomen ultra￾sonography was normal in one. Two patients
have been treated with ursodeoxycholic acid
for two and five years respectively with biologi￾68

cal improvement in only one of them. All but
one of these seven children presented with
relapsing episodes of bronchopulmonary infec￾tions with chest radiography compatible with
cystic fibrosis lesions; two had episodes of
hyponatraemic dehydration including one dur￾ing an episode of heat stroke. Hydrocortisone
has been administered daily to the patient with
hypopituitarism and at the age of 10 months
transection of the pituitary stalk was evidenced
by magnetic resonance imaging; growth
hormone and partial thyroid stimulating hor￾mone deficiency were demonstrated. Treat￾ment by growth hormone and L-thyroxine was
added, and resulted in a progressive ability to
thrive. This patient is doing well with satisfac￾tory lung and liver status and with no mental
retardation.
Discussion
Although several reports have already de￾scribed neonatal cholestasis in patients suffer￾ing from cystic fibrosis, the patients reported
here enabled us to stress various points regard￾ing this association.
Neonatal cholestasis associated with cystic
fibrosis is a rare condition. We found 31
children described in English language
publications,' 19 and seven more in French
journals.""'5 In our series the incidence of
cystic fibrosis among causes of neonatal
cholestasis was 6/1000. The true incidence
may be lower as at least two patients in this
series also had another condition known to be
associated with neonatal cholestasis. 26 How￾ever the presence of mucous material in the
lumen of the extrahepatic as well as in intrahe￾patic bile ducts seen in one patient and already
reported is compatible with a bile excretion
defect at the origin of cholestasis in these chil￾dren. 27
Many of the features of cystic fibrosis associ￾ated neonatal cholestasis are non-specific or
even misleading. In two patients reported here,
the permanently acholic stools and firm
hepatomegaly were consistent with a clinical
diagnosis of biliary atresia. In one of them
however, necropsy showed patency of the
extrahepatic biliary duct. Two other reports
dealing with the same problem conclude
differently. Perkins et al consider that a positive
sweat chloride test should postpone surgery 1
but Festen et al suggest that intervention is
essential because they had histological evi￾dence for biliary atresia in one patient with
cystic fibrosis.'7 The liver histology is of little
help in most cases because, in our series, only
one child displayed the typical mucous plug in
the interlobular bile ducts. In most cases liver
histology shows features compatible with bile
duct obstruction. Finally there were no respira￾tory symptoms during the early months,
although all surviving children presented with
respiratory symptoms subsequently.28
We confirm, as has already been shown, 2 9 12
that delay in meconium passage, present in
four of these children, is a valuable marker for
the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis in children with
neonatal cholestasis. Another valuable finding
is the presence of normal serum cholesterol
concentration, present in seven of the nine
children, despite severe cholestatic jaundice.
The only child with a high serum cholesterol
concentration also had al-antitrypsin defi￾ciency, which may have increased the choles￾terol levels. Serum cholesterol concentrations
are reported for nine patients described in the
literature 6 9 20 22 24 and were normal in seven, in
addition to another with raised total serum
cholesterol and associated cytomegalovirus
hepatitis.
Prognosis of the liver condition in neonates
with cystic fibrosis and cholestatic jaundice is
varied; it may lead to liver failure after a few
months as in patient 4 of our series,22 or it may
progress to early cirrhosis as in patient 6, in
whom associated al-antitrypsin deficiency
may have increased the risk of cirrhosis. In six
children of our series, however, there were no
evident signs of cirrhosis with a follow up of 3.5
to 19 years. Thus neonatal cholestasis is not
necessarily predictive of an early occurrence of
cirrhosis.'5 In the 38 cases of neonatal cholesta￾sis associated with cystic fibrosis described in
the literature, cirrhosis during infancy has been
reported in six cases at ages of 1 month to 1
year, and cirrhosis was seen at necropsy. How￾ever, there is no significant follow up for the
other children reported, such that it is not pos￾sible to estimate the true overall incidence of
cirrhosis in children with cystic fibrosis who
present with neonatal cholestasis.
As many factors have been proposed as
causing neonatal cholestasis in cystic fibrosis,
different kinds of treatment, both conservative
and aggressive, have been reported in the
literature. 6 8 12 17 19 Ursodeoxycholic acid treat￾ment, recommended for patients with meco￾nium ileus, may also benefit patients with neo￾natal cholestasis due to the same disease.2930
