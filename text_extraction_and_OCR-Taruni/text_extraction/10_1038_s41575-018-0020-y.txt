Sinusoidal endothelial cells line what constitutes a 
unique vascular bed in the liver, which receives blood 
from both the hepatic artery and the portal veins into 
the hepatic parenchyma (Fig. 1). Studies of these cells 
isolated from animals usually refer to them as liver 
sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), whereas isolated 
human cells have also been referred to as human hepatic 
sinusoidal endothelial cells (HSECs). For the purpose 
of this Review, we use the term LSEC. The exposure of 
these sinusoidal endothelial cells to blood originating 
from both the gut and the systemic circulation means 
they are ideally situated to remove and recycle blood￾borne proteins and lipids. In combination with Kupffer 
cells (KCs; liver-resident macrophages), LSECs consti￾tute the most powerful scavenger system in the body1
. 
This activity is facilitated by the presence of fenestrae 
in LSECs, their lack of a classical basement membrane 
and their expression of promiscuous scavenger receptors 
combined with the most potent endocytic capacity in 
the body2
. Thus, virus particles3
, advanced glycation end 
products4
 and modified LDL cholesterol5
 can be cleared 
from the circulation within minutes by this route.
Endothelial cells in different vascular beds are gener￾ated from common early embryological precursors and 
have broadly similar histological appearance and func￾tional roles throughout the body. However, extensive 
variations in phenotype and function arise as a conse￾quence of local microenvironmental signals dependent 
on anatomical localization6
. The vascular architecture 
in the human liver is acquired by 17–25 weeks of gesta￾tion, but different vessels within the liver have distinct 
embryonic origins. Thus, portal vessels are derived from 
vitelline veins, whereas sinusoids develop from capillary 
vessels of the septum transversum and acquire their 
distinctive fenestrated phenotype by week 20 of gesta￾tion7
 under the control of transcription factor GATA4 
(ref.
8
). From this point onward, sinusoidal endothelial 
cells remain functionally and phenotypically distinct 
from the other vascular endothelial cells in the liver 
microenvironment and assume a phenotype that has 
many similarities with lymphatic endothelial cells9
. The 
unique characteristics of LSECs are presented in Box 1. 
Both lymphatic and sinusoidal endothelial cells have 
minimal basement membranes and loosely organized 
cell junctions10 and share a complement of receptors 
such as lymphatic vessel endothelial hyaluronic acid 
receptor (LYVE1)11, prospero homeobox protein 1 
(PROX1)12, podoplanin13 and liver/lymph node-specific 
ICAM3-grabbing non-integrin (LSIGN; also known as 
CLEC4M)14. It has been shown that the phenotype of 
sinusoidal endothelial cells varies across the liver acinus; 
a study of human liver tissue published in 2017 demon￾strated that zone 1 LSECs are CD36hi and LYVE1low, 
whereas zone 2 and zone 3 LSECs are CD36low, LYVE1hi
and CD32hi (ref.
15). The presence of fenestrations or 
membranous pores organized into sieve plates is a fea￾ture that also distinguishes LSECs from the other hepatic 
endothelial populations2
.
Fenestrations are not unique to hepatic endothelial 
cells and are also found in endothelium in endocrine 
glands such as the pancreas16, kidney17, spleen18 and bone 
marrow19 and are sometimes observed in tumour vas￾culature20. However, unlike other fenestrated endothe￾lial populations such as those in the kidney, hepatic

Abstract | Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) line the low shear, sinusoidal capillary channels 
of the liver and are the most abundant non-parenchymal hepatic cell population. LSECs do not 
simply form a barrier within the hepatic sinusoids but have vital physiological and immunological 
functions, including filtration, endocytosis, antigen presentation and leukocyte recruitment. 
Reflecting these multifunctional properties, LSECs display unique structural and phenotypic 
features that differentiate them from the capillary endothelium present within other organs. 
It is now clear that LSECs have a critical role in maintaining immune homeostasis within the liver 
and in mediating the immune response during acute and chronic liver injury. In this Review, 
we outline how LSECs influence the immune microenvironment within the liver and discuss 
their contribution to immune-mediated liver diseases and the complications of fibrosis 
and carcinogenesis.

fenestrations lack a diaphragm or basal lamina and are 
grouped into organized sieve plates, rendering LSECs 
highly permeable (Fig. 1d). Many studies have impli￾cated vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) as 
an essential factor for regulation of fenestrations21, 
but dynamic changes in hepatic fenestration number 
and size can occur rapidly in response to agents such 
as alcohol22, dietary constituents23 and fasting24 or cal￾orie restriction25. The fenestrations act as a ‘dynamic 
filter’ (ref.
26) to permit the access of macromolecules to 
parenchymal cells, and in addition, these pores might 
allow circulating viruses to gain access to hepatocytes27. 
Evidence from animal studies suggests that fenestrations 
can constitute up to 40% of the cell and that the size, dis￾tribution and clustering of the pores in sieve plates varies 
with the zonal distribution of the endothelium28 and across 
the endothelial surface. Up to one-third of these pores 
are organized into complex labyrinths, and many are 
associated with components of microtubules29, caveoli 
and coated pits to form a transport network that could 
impose additional regulation on the traffic of material 
into the cells30, enabling them to govern the movement 
of materials to and from the liver parenchyma.
Balancing tolerance and immune response
The permissive nature of sinusoidal endothelium 
probably evolved to handle the constant exposure of 
the liver to microbial and food antigens derived from the 
gastrointestinal tract via the portal vein. The liver needs 
to ensure that damaging immune responses are not pre￾cipitated against harmless antigens while at the same time 
being able to eliminate invading pathogens. The first site 
of exposure to these antigens occurs within the hepatic 
sinusoids, and both KCs and LSECs are important players 
in taking up and eliminating soluble antigens entering 
via the portal vein and in determining the nature of any 
immune response such antigens trigger.
The initial critical step in an immune response is 
the innate pathway of antigen uptake by pattern rec￾ognition receptors31. Pattern recognition receptors are 
highly evolutionarily conserved and include the Toll-like 
receptor (TLR) family and the scavenger receptors31. 
An example of how the liver regulates inflammatory 
and immune responses is seen in the recognition of 
the TLR4 ligand lipopolysaccharide (LPS) by KCs and 
LSECs. Chronic exposure of both KCs and LSECs to LPS 
leads to an LPS-refractory state, and in LSECs specifi￾cally, LPS exposure is associated with reduced nuclear 
translocation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and subse￾quent reduced leukocyte adhesion32. This mechanism 
prevents the liver from being in a constantly activated 
inflamed state in response to the constant exposure to 
bacterial products from the gut. Studies of other TLRs 
demonstrate that LSECs can respond to signals medi￾ated via TLR1–TLR4, TLR6, TLR8 and TLR9, but their 
activation has cell-specific responses that are restricted 
compared with classical antigen-presenting cells, thereby 
contributing to an organ-specific response to antigens 
and the tolerogenic environment of the liver33.
A unique characteristic of LSECs is their expression 
of high levels of several scavenger receptors compared 
with conventional endothelium. Scavenger receptors are 
a diverse family of pattern recognition receptors that, 
like TLRs, are highly evolutionarily conserved34. In 
contrast to TLRs, they were believed to be function￾ally redundant and to perform silent uptake of ligands. 
However, gathering evidence suggests that this is not 
the case and that scavenger receptors have an impor￾tant cell-specific role in immune responses34. They have 
been shown to promote potent pro-inflammatory and 
anti-inflammatory signalling as well as to directly inter￾act with TLRs. Membrane-bound scavenger receptors 
recognize their extracellular ligands, which leads to 
internalization of the ligand, termed endocytosis, and 
trafficking from the cell membrane to intracellular com￾partments such as endosomes. The high levels of scav￾enger receptors on LSECs give them a high endocytic 
capacity. One of the most extensively studied scavenger 
receptors on LSECs is the mannose receptor (MR)1,35,36. 
Others include the homologous scavenger receptors sta￾bilin 1 and stabilin 2 (ref.
37) and related molecules such 
as C-type lectins, including the type 2 receptor subclass 
dendritic cell-specific ICAM3-grabbing non-integrin 
(DCSIGN; also known as CD209) and LSIGN14,38. 
The members of the C-type lectin group are involved 
in varied functions ranging from cell–cell interaction 
to uptake of serum glycoproteins. A third lectin with 
a similar structure to DCSIGN and LSIGN has been 
identified and designated the liver and lymph node 
sinusoidal endothelial cell C-type lectin (LSECTIN; also 
known as CLEC4G)39. This lectin has been shown to be 
co-expressed with LSIGN and is encoded in the same 
cluster of lectin-encoding genes as DCSIGN and LSIGN.
Innate immunity. Several of the C-type lectin receptor 
family members have been directly implicated in viral 
uptake. Both DCSIGN and LSIGN have been shown 
to interact with the Ebola virus and HIV, as well as the 
coronavirus40,41. Both these receptors have also been 
shown to be expressed on LSECs and bind the E2 glyco￾protein of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) and facilitate 
hepatocyte infection14. LSECTIN has also been impli￾cated in the uptake of severe acute respiratory syn￾drome coronavirus and HCV42,43. The ability of LSECs 
to bind multiple viruses through their diverse endocytic 
receptors gives them a crucial role in the response to 
viral infections and a specific role in mediating rapid 
Key points
•	Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) that line the hepatic sinusoids have 
important physiological roles and mediate the filtration and scavenger functions 
of the liver.
•	LSECs also have innate and adaptive immunological functions, including antigen 
presentation and maintenance of the balance between tolerance and effector 
immune responses.
•	In inflammatory liver diseases, LSECs influence the composition of hepatic immune 
populations by mediating diapedesis of leukocyte subsets via distinct combinations 
of adhesion molecules and chemokines.
•	LSECs play a crucial part in the cellular crosstalk that regulates progressive chronic 
liver disease, which leads to fibrosis and carcinogenesis.
•	The role of LSECs in initiating immune responses and contributing to progressive 
liver disease makes them a potential therapeutic target for treating inflammatory 
liver diseases.

clearance of blood-borne viruses44. In a mouse model 
of adenovirus infection, 90% of virus is found in LSECs 
and 10% is found in KCs within a minute of intrave￾nous viral infusion44. A study published in 2017 reported 
that HIV-like particles are taken up by mouse LSECs 
at a rate of 100 million particles per minute3
. After 
receptor-mediated endocytosis of circulating matrix 
breakdown products, the subsequent transit from early 
endosomes to late endosomes takes several hours45. 
The transit of viruses internalized by LSECs is less 
well understood. LSECs enable direct entry of certain 
viruses such as Ebola, whereas with other viruses, such 
as HCV and HBV, LSECs promote hepatotropism by 
facilitating parenchymal cell infection46. Rapid uptake 
of virus can also lead to redistribution to other cells, 
for instance, in animal models of HBV, viral particles 
are preferentially taken up by LSECs and subsequently 
passed on to infect underlying hepatocytes47. In the 
case of HCV, innate sensing of viral infection by LSECs 
leads to downstream signalling and release of paracrine 
signals such as the pro-viral molecule bone morpho￾genetic protein 4 (BMP4), which increases viral infec￾tion of hepatocytes48. On the other hand, direct sensing 
of HCV RNA in LSECs also leads to the release of type I 
and type III interferon-rich exosomes that inhibit HCV 
replication49. The balance of such responses will deter￾mine whether virus infection is established or prevented, 
thereby emphasizing the critical role that LSECs play in 
hepatotropic viral infections.
Adaptive immunity. LSECs not only regulate innate 
immune responses but also directly regulate adaptive 
immune responses through antigen presentation to 
T cells (Fig. 2). Knolle's group demonstrated that LSECs 
can cross-present antigen to CD8+
 T cells50 by using scav￾enger receptors, notably the mannose receptor, to take 
up, process and transfer antigen to major histocompat￾ibility complex (MHC) class I (ref.
51). The presentation

of antigen, including oral antigens, by LSECs drives 
a tolerogenic response in naive CD8+ T cells that is 
mediated by upregulation on LSECs of the co-inhibitory 
molecule programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PDL1), 
which can activate its receptor programmed cell death 
protein 1 (PD1) on naive T cells50,52,53. Endocytosis of 
antigens by the mannose receptor on LSECs has been 
shown to promote CD8+ T cell tolerance54, including 
tolerance to tumour antigens55. However, it is crucial 
that rapid effector responses can be generated locally 
to harmful pathogens; consistently, LSEC-driven T cell 
activation changes in response to antigen load and 
local inflammatory factors. For example, in a culture 
model with mouse LSECs in which antigens at vary￾ing concentrations were delivered to LSECs for cross 
presentation to CD8+ T cells, high antigen concentra￾tions led to a shift from tolerogenic to effector T cell 
differentiation56 as a consequence of enhanced T cell 
receptor (TCR) signalling that overcame PD1-mediated 
tolerogenic responses. This response is also affected by 
local levels of IL-2. Furthermore, rapid activation of 
CD8+ T cells by LSECs occurs in the presence of IL-6 
trans-signalling, and this activation not only drives 
rapid effector T cell differentiation but also primes 
T cells to respond to other inflammatory signals and 
leads to sustained effector responses57.
LSECs also express MHC class II molecules that ena￾ble them to present antigens to CD4+
 T cells58. However, 
the low levels of co-stimulatory molecules on LSECs 
means that rather than driving naive CD4+
 T cell differ￾entiation to T helper cells59, they promote the develop￾ment of regulatory T cells60. In vivo studies have shown 
that these tolerogenic properties of LSECs can control 
autoimmunity. Circulating inflammatory CD4+ T cells 
(T helper 1 (TH1) cells and TH17 cells) were shown to 
interact repeatedly with liver sinusoidal endothelium, 
and this interaction successfully suppressed inflam￾matory cytokine release in mice61. The induction of 
autoantigen-specific T regulatory cells by LSECs was also 
shown to have important systemic effects by ameliorating 
damage in mouse models of autoimmune central nervous 
system disease62,63. This finding has therapeutic implica￾tions for systemic as well as local immunity and has led 
to development of nanotechnology-based strategies to 
deliver autoantigen to LSECs as part of tolerance induc￾tion protocols63. C-type lectins also contribute to the 
unique ability of LSECs to control T cell differentiation. 
Thus, LSECTIN on LSECs inhibits T cell activation and 
effector functions through its interaction with CD44 on 
activated T cells64.
LSECs in inflammatory liver disease
In addition to their roles as pathogen recognition and 
antigen-presenting cells, LSECs also have a critical role 
in regulating the recruitment of leukocytes into liver tis￾sue (Box 2). A key step in the progression of liver injury 
or infection, regardless of aetiology, is the development 
of hepatitis as a consequence of the recruitment of leuko￾cytes from the circulation. The balance and retention 
of immune subsets within the liver determines whether 
injury resolves, persists or progresses to either liver 
failure or chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis65. Leukocyte 
recruitment from the blood occurs as a consequence 
of a multistep adhesion cascade that enables leukocytes

Expression of scavenger receptors
LSECs have very potent scavenger capabilities by virtue of expression of 
many scavenger receptors, including mannose receptor (MR), CD32, 
stabilin 1, stabilin 2, scavenger receptor B1 (SRB1) and scavenger receptor 
class F member 1 (SCARF 1), liver/lymph node-specific ICAM3-grabbing

cell adhesion molecule 1 (MADCAM1) can contribute to recruitment of 
immune cells in a disease-specific context

flowing in the circulation to be captured by activated 
endothelial cells and then to migrate through the 
endothelium towards sites of infection or injury66. The 
cascade consists of sequential steps mediated by inter￾actions between receptors on the surface of leukocytes 
and endothelial cells. The general paradigm applies to 
all vascular beds, but tissue-specific and inflammation￾specific interactions provide powerful local regulation 
of where, when and which leukocytes are recruited. The 
steps in the cascade are broadly described as rolling or 
tethering, in which the leukocyte is captured from the 
circulation and induced to roll on the endothelial sur￾face. In most vascular beds, this step is mediated by a 
family of receptors termed selectins, but other receptors 
are involved under specific circumstances, such as in the 
hepatic sinusoids67. Leukocyte rolling is followed by acti￾vation of leukocyte integrins in response to tissue-derived 
chemoattractant cytokines (chemokines) sequestered in 
the endothelial glycocalyx68,69, which leads to firm adhe￾sion mediated by integrins binding to immunoglobulin 
superfamily members on the endothelial surface. This 
adhesion is followed by intravascular crawling of the 
adherent leukocyte on the endothelium, which occurs 
before the final step of transmigration, in which the 
leukocyte migrates across the endothelium, through 
the post-endothelial tissue and into the liver paren￾chyma. The transmigration step is mediated by a 
complex series of receptor–ligand interactions, with 
cytoskeletal changes in both the endothelial cells and 
the leukocytes, and which enable the cell to cross the 
endothelium without disrupting the vascular barrier70.
Cell recruitment to the liver has several features that 
are distinct from the general adhesion cascade (Fig. 3). 
Recruitment of the majority of leukocytes occurs within 
the sinusoidal channels of the liver, in contrast to most 
other organs in which recruitment occurs within the 
post-capillary venules71. Furthermore, the recruitment 
of leukocytes subsets to the liver is regulated by specific 
combinations of typical and atypical adhesion molecules, 
reflecting the unique phenotype and structure of LSECs 
and the anatomy and rheology of the sinusoids (Box 1). 
The sinusoids are narrow, in some places, no wider than 
a flowing leukocyte, and characterized by low shear 
stress. These properties mean that the initial recruitment 
step does not require rolling and in most circumstances 
is selectin-independent. As a consequence, sinusoi￾dal endothelium expresses minimal levels of selectins 
in vivo71,72. A summary of the key adhesion factors is 
outlined in Table 1.
Immunoglobulin superfamily. The conventional 
endothelial adhesion molecules that mediate firm 
adhesion of leukocytes, intercellular adhesion mol￾ecule 1 (ICAM1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 
(VCAM1)69,73, are expressed at high levels on inflamed 
LSECs74. Their role in lymphocyte recruitment to the 
liver has been confirmed in both in vitro and in vivo 
assays. VCAM1, which binds the α4β1 integrin 
expressed on lymphocytes, has an important role in 
capturing lymphocytes from blood flow and mediat￾ing stabilization65,75. ICAM1 binds to αLβ2 integrin to 
support firm adhesion within the hepatic sinusoids71. 
Another family member is mucosal vascular addres￾sin cell adhesion molecule 1 (MADCAM1), which 
binds to the α4β7 integrin and plays a major part in 
lymphocyte homing to the gut via mucosal vessels76. 
Our group demonstrated that this receptor was also 
upregulated in the liver in some chronic liver diseases,

in which it promotes the recruitment of T cells activated 
in the gut that express high levels of α4β7 integrin,
thereby contributing to the link between IBD and 
inflammatory liver disease77,78. Although many of these 
immunoglobulin superfamily members are regulated by 
pro-inflammatory cytokines, their adhesive function is 
also dependent on the formation of cell surface platforms 
regulated by the tetraspanin family of receptors, which 
form microdomains and associate laterally with ICAM1 
and VCAM1 (refs79,80). For example, our group con￾firmed that CD151 associates with VCAM1 on LSECs 
and regulates lymphocyte adhesion under shear stress81.
Atypical adhesive and migratory routes. In addition to 
conventional adhesion molecules, our group and others 
have demonstrated that LSECs use atypical adhesion 
molecules to regulate leukocyte recruitment. Vascular 
adhesion protein 1 (VAP1; also known as AOC3) is a 
membrane-bound amine oxidase that was originally 
shown to mediate lymphocyte binding to high endothe￾lial venules, the specialized post-capillary venules found 
in lymph nodes82. Further studies confirmed that VAP1 
was expressed at high levels in chronic liver disease and 
mediated adhesion and transmigration across LSECs83. 
Models of in vitro and in vivo inflammatory liver injury 
corroborated its role in mediating recruitment during 
liver inflammation. VAP1 has unique properties gener￾ated by its enzyme activity that can upregulate expression 
of adhesion molecules and chemokines in LSECs, thereby 
amplifying leukocyte recruitment84–87. The scavenger 
receptor family of endothelial receptors also contrib￾utes to leukocyte recruitment to the liver. Stabilin 2 was 
shown to regulate lymphocyte adhesion to LSECs via 
the αMβ2 integrin (ref.
88), and its homologue, stabilin 1, 
was originally shown to mediate recruitment across 
lymphatic endothelium89. Similarly, expression of stabilin 1 
is upregulated in chronic liver disease and hepatocellu￾lar carcinoma, in which it mediates transmigration of 
lymphocytes across LSECs under shear stress90.
Following adherence, leukocytes crawl across the 
endothelial surface before undergoing transmigration, 
which usually occurs via endothelial junctions, termed 
the paracellular route91,92. Several studies have demon￾strated that lymphocyte interactions with LSECs within 
the sinusoids trigger important immune effector mech￾anisms93,94, which might influence the infiltration and 
positioning of cells within the liver in inflammatory liver 
diseaes74. Thus, it is important to understand how the 
process of transendothelial migration through LSECs 
is regulated. Visualization of this process using con￾focal imaging of lymphocytes migrating across LSECs 
under shear stress demonstrated that ~50% of cells 
took a transcellular route of migration and migrated 
directly through the endothelial body90 as opposed to 
the conventional paracellular route. This transcellular 
migration route involved the formation of ICAM1-rich 
channels to facilitate lymphocyte migration. Although 
transcellular migration has been noted in some other 
specialized endothelial beds, its function and molecu￾lar basis remain poorly understood95. Transendothelial 
migration is a multistep process involving different 
combinations of receptors that enables preferential 
recruitment of particular leukocyte subsets, as described 
in the following sections. An additional step in migra￾tion was described in 2016 in which lymphocytes 
migrate into LSECs and then crawl within the endothe￾lial cell to the cell junction, through which they enter 
the adjacent endothelial cell96. This process, which we 
term intracellular crawling, is dependent on IFNγ and 
could not be detected when LSECs were stimulated by 
other interferon family cytokines. IFNγ treatment did 
alter the cytoskeleton of LSECs, which might promote 
intracellular crawling. This process was also facilitated 
by the unique junctional complexes between LSECs. 
The functional consequences of intracellular crawling 
are yet to be elucidated but could have an important role 
in lymphocyte positioning in liver tissue.
Chemokines. Chemokines are a family of small secreted 
proteins ranging from 67 to 127 amino acids in size that 
bind to heparin sulfate on proteoglycans97,98. They play 
central parts in leukocyte migration during homeostasis

Hepatitis C
Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) participate in the recruitment and positioning 
of effector T cellsin hepatitisCthrough sinusoidal endothelial expression ofthe
adhesion molecules intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM1), vascular cell adhesion 
molecule 1 (VCAM1) and vascular adhesion protein 1 (VAP1) and the presentation of 
CXC-chemokine receptor 3 (CXCR3) ligands associated with compartmentalization 
within the parenchyma101,108. LSECs also aid the retention of CXCR6+ T cellsthrough the
expression of the ligand CXC-chemokine ligand 16 (CXCL16)107.
Primary sclerosing cholangitis
LSECs play a role in the aberrant homing of mucosal effector lymphocytes through the 
expression of mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule 1 (MADCAM1) and CC￾chemokine ligand 25 (CCL25) on hepatic sinusoidal endothelium77,103. VAP1 regulates 
the expression of MADCAM1 by deaminating primary amines and driving a nuclear 
factor-κB (NF-κB)-dependent pathway85,87.
Autoimmune hepatitis
LSECs participate in the initial T cell-mediated damage directed to sinusoidal
endothelium as an initiating event in models of autoimmune hepatitis138. Upregulation 
of adhesion molecules such as MADCAM1 promotes lymphocyte recruitment77. 
Development of LSEC-reactive autoantibodies leads to capillarization of sinusoidal 
endothelium and progressive liver disease139.
Alcoholic liver disease and NAFLD
Defenestration and activation are early changes in models of alcoholic and fatty liver 
disease157,158. The presentation of chemokines by sinusoidal endothelium leads to 
recruitment of T cells, which participate in compartmentalization and lead to
progressive disease100.
Fibrosis
LSECs prevent hepatic stellate cell activation21. This ability to maintain hepatic stellate 
cell quiescence is lost during capillarization of LSECs driven by chronic injury143. 
Capillarization leads to impaired endothelial NOS (ENOS; also known as NOS3) activity, 
leading to low nitric oxide production172 and increased Hedgehog signalling171.
Hepatocellular cancer
Hepatocellular cancer leads to endothelial transdifferentiation with loss of several 
LSEC markers174. Presentation of CXC-chemokines and CC-chemokines and 
expression of ICAM1, VAP1 and CD151 promote lymphocyte recruitment to areas 
of hepatocellular carcinoma81,102,146. Stabilin 1 expression might promote regulatory 
T cell-specific recruitment90.

chemokines on liver vasculature has been demonstrated 
in a range of chronic inflammatory liver diseases, 
including alcoholic liver disease, primary sclerosing 
cholangitis and chronic graft rejection99–103. In these con￾ditions, chemokines seem to be compartmentalized to 
the sinusoidal vasculature and portal vessels and have 
a substantial influence on immune cell localization and 
subsequent disease progression100,101,104. T cell migra￾tion across sinusoidal endothelium is mediated by the 
interferon-inducible chemokines CXC-chemokine 
ligand 9 (CXCL9) and particularly CXCL10, which bind 
the receptor CXC-chemokine receptor 3 (CXCR3)105,106. 
In other diseases, including chronic HCV infection, 
the chemokine CXCL16, which exists in a transmem￾brane form, is expressed on sinusoidal endothelium, 
hepatocytes and bile ducts, enabling it to regulate the 
recruitment and retention of CXCR6+ effector T cells 
within the liver107,108. Subsets of natural killer (NK) and 
NK T cells express high levels of CXCR6 that enable them 
to interact with CXCL16 on sinusoidal endothelium; this 
interaction promotes active migration along the sinusoids 
as part of a process of ongoing immune surveillance and 
patrolling109. Studies in mouse liver endothelial cells 
have shown that a vital property of chemokine-mediated 
recruitment is the transcytosis of chemokines from 
the basolateral side to the luminal side of sinusoidal 
endothelial cells110. This process is clathrin-dependent 
and promotes the transendothelial migration of lym￾phocytes across LSECs, and inhibition of this pathway 
reduces CD4+
 T cell recruitment during liver injury111.
Immune subset recruitment
The balance of immune subsets determines the progres￾sion and outcome of immune responses within the 
liver: persistent effector responses will drive chronic 
inflammatory conditions, whereas excessive amounts 
of immunosuppressive immune subset populations 
promote pathogen escape and tumour formation112–114. 
In addition to the key mediators of immune cell recruit￾ment discussed earlier, there is now evidence that 
immune cell subsets utilize distinct combinations of 
these factors to migrate through the hepatic sinusoids 
under specific circumstances.
T cells. T helper cells are divided into multiple functional 
subsets on the basis of the cytokines they secrete and that 
are dependent on the microenvironment in which they 
are activated by antigens. In a concanavalin A liver mouse 
inflammation model, TH1 cell recruitment through the 
sinusoids was mediated by α4β1 integrin interactions, 
whereas TH2 cells used VAP1 (ref.
84). Both effector TH17 
cells and regulatory T (Treg) cells found in the liver express

Fig. 3 | Lymphocyte recruitment within the hepatic sinusoids. Lymphocyte recruitment involves an adhesion cascade 
within the hepatic sinusoids that is influenced by the low shear environment and cellular crosstalk between parenchymal 
and non-parenchymal cells. Chronic parenchymal cell damage leads to the release of danger-associated molecular 
patterns (DAMPs) and pro-inflammatory mediators by Kupffer cells, which increase adhesion molecule expression by liver 
sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) (step 1). Lymphocyte recruitment across activated LSECs involves a selectin￾independent tethering step (step 2), followed by integrin activation and firm adhesion to immunoglobulin superfamily 
members on the LSEC surface (step 3). This process is influenced by paracrine factors released from hepatocytes. 
Lymphocytes then crawl along the luminal endothelium (step 4) until they receive a signal to transmigrate across LSECs 
through either a paracellular or a transcellular route (step 5). A third route of lymphocyte migration involves intracellular 
migration directly into the LSEC body and then migration to the adjacent LSEC, termed intracellular crawling (step 6).

high levels of the chemokine receptor CXCR3 and use it 
to migrate across LSECs115,116. Subsequent signals deter￾mine where these cells localize within the liver, with 
CC-chemokine receptor 6 (CCR6)+
 TH17 cells migrating 
towards their ligand, CC-chemokine ligand 20 (CCL20), 
which is secreted by bile ducts, whereas Treg cells respond 
to different chemokines as a consequence of their expres￾sion of CCR5, CCR4 and in some cases CCR10 (refs116,117). 
Treg cells were also shown to use a distinct combination 
of adhesion receptors, involving stabilin 1, ICAM1 and 
VAP1, to migrate across human LSECs under flow90, 
whereas recruitment of CD8+ T cells to the mouse liver 
is primarily dependent on ICAM1 expression by LSECs 
with a lesser contribution from VCAM1 (refs118,119). In 
autoimmune hepatitis and primary sclerosing chol￾angitis (PSC) associated with IBD, LSECs present the 
chemokine CCL25, which can trigger CCR9+
 gut-homing 
lymphocyte interactions with MADCAM1 to promote 
recruitment of mucosal T cells103,120.
These distinct mechanisms of migration across 
LSECs are probably influenced by epithelial responses 
to tissue injury115,121, stromal signals122 and cooperative 
interactions between several cell types in the sinusoid. 
For instance, in a model of HBV infection, effector CD8+
T cells were shown to arrest in the sinusoids by inter￾acting with platelets adherent to the sinusoidal surface 
via hyaluronan-dependent mechanisms94. Subsequently, 
the CD8+ T cells crawled along the sinusoids, probing 
through the LSEC fenestrae for viral antigens presented 
by underlying hepatocytes. Antigen recognition as 
a consequence of this probing behaviour led to effec￾tor functions by a diapedesis-independent process. 
A human model of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection 
of LSECs led to the recruitment of effector T cells and 
activated Treg cells in a lymphocyte function-associated 
antigen 3 (LFA3)-dependent mechanism123. In this study, 
CMV-infected human LSECs upregulated LFA3 at inter￾cellular junctions, and during effector T cell recruitment, 
the interaction of LFA3 with its ligand, CD2, on T cells 
contributed to TH1 cell activation.
B cells. Although B cells are present in substantial num￾bers in chronically inflamed liver tissue, the molecular 
mechanism regulating their recruitment from blood 
into hepatic tissue is poorly understood. Our group 
demonstrated that B cell recruitment across human 
LSECs under flow was initially mediated by VCAM1-
dependent capture followed by limited intravascular 
crawling, which is distinct from the method of T cell 
recruitment124. Interestingly, the receptors involved 
in transmigration of B cells included ICAM1, VAP1 
and stabilin 1, all of which are also involved in Treg cell 
transmigration across LSECs.
Neutrophils. Neutrophils are one of the earliest immune 
cells to be recruited to a site of tissue injury, and they are 
also recruited into the liver via the hepatic sinusoids125. It 
was originally thought that their migration was mediated 
by simple physical trapping within the narrow sinusoidal 
channels, but work from McDonald et al.126 implicated a 
complex multistep recruitment process involving inter￾actions between sinusoidal hyaluronan and CD44 on the 
neutrophil surface. Whereas neutrophil interactions in 
post-sinusoidal venules followed a conventional rolling 
mediated by selectins and integrin-mediated adhesion, 
this was found not to be the case in the sinusoids, where 
the majority of neutrophil extravasation occurred. They 
found that hyaluronan was highly expressed in liver 
sinusoids and mediated the recruitment of neutrophils in 
response to LPS challenge. This interaction was depend￾ent on hyaluronan binding to CD44 rather than to the 
other hyaluronan receptor, receptor for hyaluronan￾mediated motility (RHAMM; also known as HMMR). 
A study published in 2014 also highlighted the impor￾tance of TLRs for neutrophil recruitment. TLR2–protein 
S100A9 signalling in particular promoted the production 
of the chemokines CXCL1 and CXCL2, which are known 
to mediate neutrophil migration, by liver macrophages 
in acute and chronic mouse models of liver injury127.
Monocytes. In addition to the activation of resident 
KCs, monocytes and macrophages are also recruited to 
the liver from the circulation during inflammation or 
in response to injury. KCs are yolk sac-derived tissue 
macrophages found within the hepatic sinusoids; they 
are immobile and probe the environment with pseudo￾pods128. The response to liver injury also includes an 
influx of monocytes, which have a major role in regu￾lating inflammation, regeneration, repair and fibrosis129. 
Furthermore, acute liver injury is associated with an initial 
influx of transcription factor GATA6+
 peritoneal macro￾phages that enter directly through the mesothelium in a 
process dependent on CD44 and the danger-associated 
molecular pattern (DAMP) molecule ATP128. This entry 
is followed by the recruitment of CCR2+
 monocytes from

the circulation130. The subsequent recruitment signals 
governing monocyte migration through the sinusoids 
are less well characterized, but several key factors have 
been determined. The dominant chemokine receptor–
ligand interaction that mediates migration of CD16+
monocytes across LSECs is CX3C-chemokine receptor 1 
(CX3CR1) binding to its ligand CX3C-chemokine ligand 
1 (CX3CL1), one of the few transmembrane chemokines. 
Expression of CX3CL1 is restricted to bile ducts in the 
normal liver, yet this protein is expressed at high levels 
on inflamed sinusoidal endothelium131. In this study, 
VAP1 also contributed to adhesion and transendothelial 
migration of CD16+
 monocytes across LSECs. The accu￾mulation of CD14+CD16+ monocytes has been reported 
in inflammatory liver disease, which is due in part to the 
preferential migration of this subset across LSECs com￾pared with CD14+CD16–
 cells132. Monocytes are known 
to undergo a phenomenon of bidirectional movement 
across endothelium that involves a reverse migration 
step133,134. This migratory behaviour has been confirmed 
in LSECs and might have a marked effect on the fate 
of monocytes and the outcome of liver injury because 
monocyte subsets which undergo reverse transmigration 
are predominantly pro-inflammatory CD16+
 monocytes. 
By contrast, those remaining in the subendothelial space 
are anti-inflammatory monocytes that suppress T cells 
and promote endotoxin tolerance135.
Interaction with other liver cells
Although we have focused on leukocyte interactions 
with LSECs, the crosstalk between LSECs and other 
liver cell populations will also influence the progres￾sion of chronic inflammatory liver diseases. KCs are 
found within the hepatic sinusoids in close association 
with LSECs and are also equipped to sense tissue injury 
from infection and toxins. The release of DAMPs and 
pathogen-associated molecular patterns triggers the 
inflammasome pathway in KCs136. Inflammasome acti￾vation is a key step in the progression of parenchymal 
liver injury, such as alcoholic liver disease, in which the 
release of danger signals from damaged hepatocytes 
stimulates the release of pro-inflammatory mediators 
from KCs137. Despite poor understanding of the crosstalk 
between LSECs and KCs, the release of these mediators 
probably influences LSEC phenotype and activation 
and leads to subsequent leukocyte recruitment138,139. 
Furthermore, KCs can promote LSEC capillarization, 
whereby LSEC morphology becomes more vascular 
or capillary like with a loss of fenestrations, and the 
formation of a characteristic basement membrane140,141.
The other cell type that populates the sinusoids is the 
hepatic stellate cell (HSC), which is positioned within 
the space of Disse. The central role of HSCs in extracel￾lular matrix production in chronic liver disease is well 
established142. It is now known that LSECs play an impor￾tant role in maintaining the quiescence of HSCs and that 
this ability is lost during capillarization of LSECs, which 
permits HSC activation and fibrogenesis21,143. Activated 
liver myofibroblasts, derived predominantly from HSCs, 
also have a role in the subsequent migration and posi￾tioning of lymphocytes following their recruitment 
through LSECs. This process is mediated by distinct 
combinations of cytokines including IL-6, VEGF and 
chemokines released by myofibroblasts122.
LSECs also have a key role in maintaining hepatocyte 
homeostasis. LSEC fenestrations enable the bidirectional 
transport of metabolites between the circulation and the 
liver parenchyma1
. LSECs also facilitate the interaction 
of circulating T cells with hepatocytes by allowing T cells 
to extend cell surface protrusions through LSEC fenes￾trations144. In chronic liver injury, microparticles are 
released from hepatocytes, leukocytes and LSECs and 
provide another route for cell–cell communication145. 
Paracrine factors released from hepatocytes influence the 
expression of adhesion molecules on overlying LSECs 
and can promote the recruitment of flowing lymphocytes 
from the sinusoids121. This mechanism might be particu￾larly important in liver cancer because malignant trans￾formation of hepatocytes enhances their ability to secrete 
chemokines CXCL10, CCL2 and CCL3 and to upregu￾late expression of ICAM1 and VAP1 on co-cultured 
LSECs102,146. Work from our group has demonstrated 
that factors secreted by hepatoma cells upregulate 
the expression of CD151 in LSECs, which promotes 
VCAM1-mediated recruitment of lymphocytes81.
Therapeutic opportunities
The evidence presented here highlights the crucial 
role played by LSECs in regulating the inflammatory 
response to liver injury. This importance makes them 
and the molecules they express attractive therapeutic 
targets in inflammatory liver disease147,148. VAP1 is a 
good example149, with studies confirming that both 
inhibition of its enzymatic activity or antibody blockade 
of its adhesive function reduce hepatic inflammation 
and fibrosis in mouse liver injury models86, and this 
work has led to a clinical trial of a humanized antibody 
against VAP1 that is currently underway (BUTEO; 
NCT02239211) in patients with PSC. Chemokines and 
adhesion molecules expressed by inflamed LSECs are 
also potential targets for anti-inflammatory therapy 
in liver disease. For example, patients with PBC have 
been treated with NI-0801, a humanized monoclonal 
antibody against CXCL10. Interestingly, the high 
production rate of CXCL10 by the inflamed liver 
made it difficult to achieve sustained neutralization 
of the chemokine in vivo despite evidence that the 
antibody could remove chemokine from the sinusoidal 
endothelial bed. Although the drug was well-tolerated 
and demonstrated immunological changes, the overall 
results were negative150. Thus, therapies directed at the 
chemokine receptors themselves might have merit, and 
evidence from early trials using the dual CCR2–CCR5 
antagonist cenicriviroc in patients with NASH suggests 
that such treatment can induce a persistent blockade151.
There is also a strong rationale to target gut-tropic 
chemokines in patients with liver diseases associated with 
IBD. Of particular relevance is PSC, a progressive biliary 
disease that is associated with IBD in 80% of patients 
and that affects ~8% of patients with IBD, particularly 
those with colitis152. Under physiological conditions, 
expression of CCL25 and MADCAM1 is absent from the 
liver, but in PSC both proteins are detectable on hepatic 
endothelium and support the aberrant recruitment of

 effector lymphocytes from the gut. Clinical 
trials are currently being considered to target the α4β7 
integrin–MADCAM1 pathways in PSC using antibodies 
developed for treating IBD.
The tolerogenic capabilities of LSECs have also been 
targeted therapeutically. Nanoparticles loaded with 
autoantigen can be targeted to LSECs as a consequence 
of their potent scavenging capability; the ability of LSECs 
to take up molecules using their scavenger receptors is 
an excellent way of potentially targeting a range of ther￾apies to the liver. Presentation of delivered autoantigens 
by LSECs to naive T cells results in the generation of 
autoantigen-specific regulatory T cells that can suppress 
systemic as well as local autoimmune responses. This 
strategy could be applied to a wide range of autoimmune 
and allergic conditions63. Targeting LSEC stabilin 1 and 
stabilin 2 with nanoparticle-based drugs153 has been 
suggested as a way to deliver local treatment to manage 
a range of conditions including ischaemia–reperfusion 
injury (a specific type of injury that follows liver surgery 
and transplantation, which is a biphasic process involving 
hypoxia followed by restoration of blood flow and reoxy￾genation) and NAFLD. Similarly, blockade of LSECTIN or 
the related molecule LSIGN has been shown to reduce the 
metastasis of colon cancer cells to the liver via impairment 
of interactions with LSECs in mouse models154,155.
During cirrhosis and chronic hepatitis, LSECs can 
undergo capillarization156. This process is associated 
with loss of GATA4-dependent signals8
, upregulation 
of CD31 and VCAM1 and loss of fenestrations156–158. 
The number of fenestrations per endothelial cell not 
only decreases with disease159–161 but also with ageing162, 
and this phenotypic change is governed by p19ARF and 
p53-dependent signalling163. These changes might 
impede the transfer of materials to or from the paren￾chyma and contribute to regional hepatocyte hypoxia. 
Capillarization is mechanistically linked to the devel￾opment of chronic inflammatory disease. In rodent 
models, it is associated with enhanced antigen pres￾entation and cytotoxic T cell priming during fibrosis148, 
and in NASH, capillarization precedes and contributes 
to the transition from simple steatosis to steatohepati￾tis157. The changes that occur in LSECs in response to 
chronic inflammation also affect angiogenic pathways. 
Neo-angiogenesis is a key feature of chronic liver dis￾ease, and the majority of neo-vessels arise from portal 
vein branches and are closely associated with areas of 
fibrogenesis164,165. A key initiating step is the capillari￾zation of LSECs, which leads to increased hepatocyte 
hypoxia and subsequent release of pro-angiogenic fac￾tors166,167. The LSEC response is context-specific; for 
example, acute injury can induce CXCR7 expression and 
a regenerative response, whereas chronic injury leads to 
CXCR4 induction, HSC proliferation and fibrogenesis168. 
During ischaemia–reperfusion injury, LSECs develop a 
pro-inflammatory, prothrombotic phenotype associ￾ated with vasoconstriction169. These changes have been 
directly linked to neutrophils because IL-33 released 
by LSECs during ischaemia–reperfusion injury trig￾gers the release of neutrophil extracellular traps, which 
exacerbate acute hepatic injury170. In chronic injury, the 
changes in endothelial phenotype that accompany capil￾larization and precede fibrosis have been linked to alter￾ations in signalling via the Hedgehog gene family171 and 
lead to vasoconstriction and increased intrahepatic vas￾cular resistance owing to reduced nitric oxide produc￾tion by LSECs172. Tumour progression in hepatocellular 
carcinoma is associated with changes in the phenotype 
of peritumoural LSECs and increased production of 
angiogenic factors including IL-6 (refs173,174).
These changes in LSECs therefore present oppor￾tunities for therapeutic intervention. For example, 
pharmacological therapy in the form of a soluble guanyl￾ate cyclase activator, which restores fenestrations, has been 
linked to fibrosis regression in rodent models21 and it 
might also be possible to use GATA4-mediated cellular 
reprogramming to restore the differentiated phenotype 
of LSECs and promote fibrosis resolution8
. Similarly, 
therapies that restore normal Hedgehog signalling 
promote regression of capillarization and the reappear￾ance of fenestrations, which suggests a potential path￾way for reversal of fibrosis and the restoration of lipid 
transport171. However, studies testing cessation of VEGF￾based cancer therapies also highlight how important the 
development of fenestrations can be in the context of 
metastasis and go some way in explaining the poor per￾formance of some strategies using anti-VEGF drugs as 
cancer treatments. Withdrawal of anti-VEGF antibody 
therapy is associated with the development of hyper￾polarized LSECs and promotion of hepatic metastasis175. 
Thus, low-dose, non-stop antiangiogenic therapy might 
present a future solution to minimize these effects.
Conclusions
Sinusoidal endothelial cells have complex interrelated 
roles in the maintenance of liver homeostasis and are 
implicated as drivers of inflammation and fibrogenesis 
in liver disease. Their unique positioning, phenotype 
and function make them attractive candidates for organ￾specific therapy, and it is likely that more therapies target￾ing these cells will be tested in the future as new treatments 
to reduce liver injury and inflammation and to prevent or 
reverse fibrogenesis. In the absence of licenced antifibrotic 
therapies, strategies to maintain the differentiation of 
LSECs and to inhibit their ability to recruit harmful pro￾inflammatory leukocytes through the selective orchestra￾tion of immune cell traffic might provide vital tools to halt 
the increase in mortality linked to chronic liver failure.
