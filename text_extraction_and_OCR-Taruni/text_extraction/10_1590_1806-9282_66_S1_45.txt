INTRODUCTION 
In the current review, we will be addressing 
the challenges of mesenchymal stem cell therapy 
(MSCs), as these cells are already being tested in hu￾man clinical studies.
MESENCHYMAL STEM CELLS (MSCS) 
MSCs, also known as stromal stem cells, are a 
diverse cell population with a wide range of poten￾tial therapeutic applications for different organs 
and tissues. MSCs can be derived from many tissue 
SUMMARY
INTRODUCTION: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is highly prevalent today. It has a multifactorial aetiology and affects people of all ages, 
genders and ethnicities. Its treatment is essentially supportive of renal function substitution, so new treatment alternatives such as 
mesenchymal stem cell therapy (MSCs) should be investigated.
METHODS: This review encompasses our understanding of the main mechanisms of action of MSCs in preclinical models of AKI by 
renal pedicle clamping ischemia-reperfusion, chemotherapy (cisplatin) and kidney transplantation in small and large animals, as well 
as outcomes in patients with AKI due to ischemia and kidney transplantation.
RESULTS: Cellular therapy with MSCs has benefits in preclinical studies of AKI through various mechanisms, such as anti-inflammatory, 
antiapoptotic, oxidative anti-stress, antifibrotic, immunomodulatory and proangiogenic. In humans, MSC therapy is safe and effec￾tive. However, the challenges of MSC cell therapy include investigating protocols about the optimal dose of these cells, the route and 
frequency of appropriate administration, and the design of further biodistribution studies over a long follow-up period. In addition, a 
better understanding of molecular signalling and cellular interactions in the microenvironment of each organ and tissue is needed in 
order to define the best time to administer MSCs. Another challenge would be to mitigate the heterogeneity of the profile of cultured 
MSCs through preconditioning approaches.
CONCLUSIONS: Cellular therapy with MSCs is very promising and should be part of the treatment of AKI patients in combination with 
other approaches already available, helping to accelerate recovery and/or slow the progression to chronic kidney disease. Randomized, 
multicentre controlled studies are needed to develop robust protocols that validate population-based cell therapy with MSCs.

MESENCHYMAL STEM CELL THERAPY IN ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY (AKI): REVIEW AND PERSPECTIVES

rodent models, including IR AKI by renal pedicle 
clamping, chemotherapy AKI (cisplatin), and kidney 
transplantation itself2-9.
Despite the evidence that cell therapy with MSCs 
contributes to the improvement of AKI, some chal￾lenges need to be overcome in order for such ther￾apy to be successfully established, such as defining 
the best route of administration, the number of cells 
per administration and also the number of injections, 
the best strategy for MSCs to migrate to acute and 
chronic kidney injury, understanding the interaction 
between MSCs and other tissue cells, and to identify 
adverse effects of MSCs (poorly differentiated in vivo 
and tumour formation).
Meta-analysis studies evaluating the therapeutic 
effect of MSCs in small animals in chronic and acute 
models of renal injury with variable administration 
(arterial, venous or renal) have shown beneficial ef￾fect for renal regeneration10. However, it is suggest￾ed that the arterial route enables renal regeneration 
more efficiently than the intravenous route. Intrave￾sources consistent with their possibly ubiquitous 
distribution.
These cells are characterized by clonogenicity, 
self-renewal, differentiation in different lineages and 
by regenerating organs with certain lesions. The Inter￾national Society for Cellular Therapy has proposed a 
series of criteria for defining human MSCs (H-MSCs), 
namely: (1) adherence to plastic under standard culture 
conditions; (2) expression of CD73, CD90, CD105 sur￾face molecules in the absence of CD34, CD45, HLA-DR, 
CD14 or CD11b, CD79a or CD19; (3) differentiation 
capacity for osteoblasts, adipocytes and chondroblasts 
in vitro (1). These criteria have been established to stan￾dardize the isolation of MSCs from humans, but may 
not apply uniformly to other mammals.

nously, cell number, multiple injections, and cell size 
increase the chance of pulmonary entrapment. Al￾though local intraparenchymal administration also 
has a beneficial effect on renal repair, this route is 
less practical for clinical application, especially since 
renal disease is diffuse.
Another emerging approach to MSC adminis￾tration-based therapies includes understanding the 
role of exosomes in tissue regeneration. Exosomes 
(30-40 to 100-120 nm) are vesicles naturally secreted 
by membranes and present ubiquitous distribution. 
These extracellular vesicles are considered import￾ant mediators of cell-to-cell communication, also 
mediating the effects of MSCs on target cells, such 
as the transfer of receptors, proteins, and genetic in￾formation (mRNA and microRNAs), as well as having 
direct stimulation in target-cell.
A key aspect that may adversely affect the ther￾apeutic potential of MSCs is the inflammatory envi￾ronment at the site of injury, as it may directly im￾pact survival and incorporation of these cells into 
the injured tissue. Thus, M2 macrophage-derived 
anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10, TGF-ß1, TGF-ß3 
and VEGF) favour the growth of MSCs, while M1 
macrophage-derived proinflammatory cytokines 
(IL-1ß, IL -6, TNF-a and IFN-y) inhibit the growth of 
MSCs in vitro(11). This observation indicates that the 
timing of MSC injection is crucial to the success of 
tissue repair.
However, further studies on renal models are still 
needed to evaluate this paradigm of transition from 
immune privilege to immunogenic state in MSC.
CELL THERAPIES USING MSC IN HUMANS
The number of registered clinical trials world￾wide and applications for Investigational New Drugs 
(IND) submitted to the US Food and Drug Adminis￾tration (FDA) have recently increased, as well as the 
diversity in donor and tissue sources and therapeutic 
purposes, despite the considerable heterogeneity in 
the protocols12. Most MSC trials included allogeneic 
cells occurring in the US, Europe, and China: phase 
1 only (26%), phase 1/2 (40.6%), phase 2 only (22.5%), 
phase 2/3 (3.8%), phase 3 (6.7%) and phase 4 (0.3%). In 
2019, 887 studies with H-MSCs were reported, 5% of 
which in renal diseases only, including AKI, DKD (di￾abetic kidney diesease), kidney transplantation and 
nephritis, among others13.
Another key aspect of MSC-based therapy is the 
isolation of MSCs from individuals with chronic dis￾eases, such as DM, for autologous transplantation. 
Thus, AT-MSC obtained from diabetic donors pres￾ent higher levels of cellular senescence and apopto￾sis than AT-MSC obtained from non-diabetic individ￾uals, as well as the reduced capacity of osteogenic 
and chondrogenic differentiation14. Similarly, type 
2 diabetic patients treated with allogeneic UC-MSC 
(1x106
/kg), by intravenous injection followed by intra￾pancreatic endovascular injection, showed a reduc￾tion in glucose and glycated haemoglobin levels after 
a 12-month follow-up, as well as systemic inflamma￾tion markers (IL-1ß and IL-6) and T lymphocyte count 
(CD3 and CD4)14. C-peptide levels also improved and 
insulin requirement decreased by ~30%. Thus, allo￾geneic versus autologous transplantation based on

the use of MSCs requires further investigation in the 
setting of DKD. On the other hand, in patients with 
ischemic cardiomyopathy, allogeneic and autologous 
BM-MSC were equally safe and effective15.
In addition, some obstacles need to be overcome 
to achieve greater safety in MSC-based therapies 
such as cytogenetic aberrations observed during 
the propagation of these cells in culture. In humans, 
malignant transformation of MSCs has not been de￾scribed in vivo so far in clinical trials. Another im￾portant aspect that should be taken into account in 
MSC cell therapy is the fact that its beneficial effect 
may be neglected by the occurrence of adipogenic 
differentiation during long-term follow-up, which 
may contribute to glomerulosclerosis.
In tables 1 and 2, we describe the main studies 
with MSCs in humans in the AKI scenario16,17 and 
after kidney transplantation18-28, respectively. In 
Table 2, we describe both studies that evaluated 
safety and efficacy at the initial moment of trans￾plantation and also at the later period. Currently, 
there are more than ten ongoing clinical studies 
involving a significant number of patients undergo￾ing kidney transplantation, which means more than 
one thousand individuals29. We highlight an ongo￾ing clinical study with the inclusion of individuals 
undergoing renal transplantation and injection of 
two doses of autologous MSCs at weeks 6 and 7, and 
alemtuzumab induction followed by maintenance 
with everolimus and discontinuation of Tacrolimus 
from week 8 onwards30.
An important point for the use of MSCs after 
kidney transplantation is the interaction between 
immunosuppressive drugs and the function of these 
cells. In vitro studies have shown that all immuno￾suppressant drugs (steroids, cyclosporine, sirolimus 
and mycophenolate) interfere in some way with the 
function of MSCs, leading to reduced production of

trophic factors (HGF and VEGF) and TSG-6, which 
has immunomodulatory properties and antiapoptot￾ic properties31.
 
NEW PERSPECTIVES 
Preconditioning or gene modifications of 
MSCs 
Several approaches have been suggested to in￾crease the efficiency of cell therapy with MSCs, such 
as preconditioning or gene modifications.
Preconditioning of MSCs
MSCs are generally grown in a 21% oxygen envi￾ronment. However, physiologically, MSCs are found 
in an environment with a much lower oxygen ten￾sion (1% to 7%). Thus, the cultivation or precondition￾ing of MSCs in a hypoxic environment with 2% or 5% 
oxygen allows these cells to remain multipotent and 
have greater proliferative and migratory capacity, 
as well as lower senescence rates32. In addition, hy￾poxia-preconditioned MSCs do not differentiate into 
tumour-associated fibroblasts in vitro and do not in￾duce tumours in vivo.
In order to reduce the heterogeneity of the MSC 
profile, which is defined by the different isolation 
and culture protocols, the preconditioning of these 
cells with proinflammatory factors has been the fo￾cus of investigation. Thus, preconditioning of MSCs 
by stimulating IFN-y, TNF-α, PGE2 and nitric oxide 
mitigated the heterogeneous behaviour of MSCs in T 
lymphocyte proliferation trials and late type hyper￾sensitivity response33.
MSCs: gene carriers or gene modifications 
Due to their migratory capacity to lesion sites, 
MSCs represent a robust platform for “delivery” 
of genes associated with regeneration and repair 
of renal tissue, working as a “Trojan Horse”. Thus, 
several genes associated with trophic factors have 
been studied for these purposes, IGF-1, HGF, EGF or 
VEGF, since they are renoprotective7,34.
Our group has been studying two genes, HGF 
and klotho, which have promising therapeutic po￾tential in the future. We are modifying MSCs with 
these genes and will be injecting them into acute and 
chronic models of kidney injury.
In the context of IR or cisplatin-induced AKI, 
HGF is associated with increased tubular epitheli￾al cell proliferation and migration, as well as lower 
α-SMA expression, fibrosis, and apoptosis. In chron￾ic models such as murine DKD, HGF gene therapy 
increased the expression of SDF-1, which is the li￾gand of CXCR4 and, consequently, bone marrow cell 
migration to the kidney. Consequently, there was an 
improvement in proteinuria, a reduction in glomer￾ulosclerosis (lower collagen I and IV deposition, and 
fibronectin) and TGF-β1 levels, a reduction in glucose 
and GLUT1-mediated glucose uptake, thus reduc￾ing oxidative stress. Similarly, in the murine Lewis 
mouse transplant model, HGF also reduced tubu￾lointerstitial fibrosis, glomerulosclerosis and inflam￾mation, leading to increased renal graft and animal 
survival.
Klotho is highly expressed in the distal tubule of 
the kidney35. It is a co-receptor for fibroblast growth 
factor-23 (FGF-23) and participates in mineral ho￾meostasis through interaction with other hormones 
such as parathyroid hormone (PTH) and 1,25-(OH)2
vitamin D3 in various tissues such as the kidneys, 
bones, intestines and parathyroid gland. There is a 
molecular signature of murine model klotho defi￾ciency and CKD in humans, both related to serum 
creatinine values related to klotho expression in re￾nal tissue, serum phosphorus and FGF23 values, ath￾erosclerosis and ectopic calcification. In the kidneys, 
the soluble form of klotho has several effects and, 
therefore, therapeutic targets, such as antioxidant 
effects on cells (decreased senescence and apoptosis, 
as well as increased autophagy), inhibition of fibro￾sis, phosphorus reduction and FGF23, proangiogenic 
agents and maintenance of the stem cell reservoir, as 
well as reducing myocardial remodelling. Similarly, 
understanding the factors that decrease klotho ex￾pression in the kidney is equally important for estab￾lishing combined therapies to mitigate AKI damage 
and reduce CKD progression and, consequently, re￾nal fibrosis. Factors that decrease kidney klotho ex￾pression include reduced kidney functional mass, ab￾normal cytokine production (↑ TNF-α and ↑ IFN-y), 
increased oxidative stress (↑ lipid peroxidation and 
hydrogen peroxide), activation of the renin-angioten￾sin-aldosterone system (RAAS), reduction of vitamin 
D3, alteration of bone metabolism (hyperphosphate￾mia) and uremic toxins (↑ indoxyl sulphate).
In AKI patients, there is a proportional reduction 
in klotho expression according to the severity of the 
lesion. Thus, the administration of klotho protein, as

vation of endogenous expression of klotho by epigen￾etic mechanisms (demethylation and deacetylation) 
and/or cell therapy itself represent promising strate￾gies. Thus, UC-MSC injection in rats subjected to IR 
injury restores kidney klotho expression, whereas 
genetically modified klotho-adenovirus MSCs lead to 
reduction of morphological and structural damage in 
the same model.
Other genetic modifications of MSCs, which are 
also quite promising in the context of AKI, include 
overexpression of erythropoietin, CXCR4, CTLA4Ig 
and IL-10/selectin, as well as transfection of biolog￾ical drug-containing minicircles such as Etanercept, 
which is a TNF-α blocker and the transfection of 
nanoparticles containing iron oxide, polymers and 
plasmids.
 
Renal tissue-derived progenitors/stem cells
Several progenitors/stem cells specific to renal 
tissue have been studied in the literature, mainly in 
preclinical studies, and evaluated in acute and chron￾ic models.
Recently our group demonstrated that c-Kit+
 cells 
present in renal tissues have cardinal progenitor/
stem cell properties, such as the ability to differenti￾ate in different lineages of the mesodermal and ecto￾dermal layers, clonogenicity, self-renewal and ther￾apeutic potential in the AKI by IR model and acute 
puromycin-induced nephrotic syndrome in rats2,36. 
In addition to paracrine effects, c-Kit cells have been 
incorporated around 10% in various renal compart￾ments, such as tubular, vascular and glomerular, 
making them promising candidates for cell therapy. 
There is interest in defining whether MSCs can mod￾ulate c-Kit stem/progenitor cells in vivo or whether 
the combined infusion of these cells can have a more 
robust effect on renal tissue regeneration or inter￾ruption of AKI and CKD progression. Recently, we 
have reported the expression of c-Kit cells in kidneys 
of deceased donors37, so future studies are needed to 
demonstrate the therapeutic potential of these cells 
in preclinical and human models.
 
Other approaches to renal regeneration: em￾bryonic stem cells, inducible pluripotent stem 
cells (iPSCs), organoids and renal decellular￾isation 
Embryonic stem cells and inducible pluripotent 
stem cells are capable of originating the three types 
of embryonic layers, giving rise to any cell type when 
appropriate culture conditions are applied. Modest 
clinical trials are underway with these cells13.
IPSCs have been studied as a model for the 
re-creation of renal diseases and culture plate, 
studies of signalling pathways, therapeutic tests, 
drug screening38, and the generation of renal and 
organoid progenitors that can be used for renal re￾generation and for a better understanding of the 
pathways involved in renal development and patho￾biological processes. Other robust platforms that 
can be used for this purpose include 3D printing 
techniques and kidney-on-a-chip microfluidic tech￾nology. Renal decellularisation presents a thera￾peutic alternative and its use has already been suc￾cessfully tested in small animals, combined with 
recellularisation with endothelial cells, renal foetal 
cells and MSCs. Renal decellularisation studies in 
larger animals are needed, and in the future, kid￾ney from pigs or from expanded criterion donors 
may be used as an alternative or as a bridge to kid￾ney transplantation.
CHALLENGES TO CELL THERAPY 
Heterogeneity of AKI causes.
Each scenario promotes a type of molecular sig￾nature, requiring specific interventions for each in 
order to regain homeostasis. Understanding the bio￾logical environment in which cells are being inserted 
is extremely important in order to design the best ap￾proach beforehand and to understand possible thera￾peutic outcomes after therapy.
High structural complexity of kidneys.
The kidneys are formed from two germinal foci, 
the ureteric bud and the metanephric mesenchyme, 
which differ in more than 30 different cell types in 
the adult kidney. Thus, an intense association be￾tween epithelium and vascular tissue is formed in 
various functions for hemodynamic balance and 
electrolyte balance.
Complicating factors of MSCs therapy itself
Exact understanding of the type of cell used
The acronym “mesenchymal (stromal) stem cell” 
refers to a diverse set of cell types and is therefore 
it is inaccurate. From the moment of cell extraction 
to the choice of tissue source, they already interfere 
with potential, function and transcripts.

MESENCHYMAL STEM CELL THERAPY IN ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY (AKI): REVIEW AND PERSPECTIVES
REV ASSOC MED BRAS 2020; 66(SUPPL 1):S:45-S54 52
Administration timing
Ideally, MSCs should be injected at the very be￾ginning of AKI changes. The difficulty of this moment 
is the silent form of the lesion, without presenting 
typical symptoms. Good biomarkers should be estab￾lished to identify as soon as possible the onset of AKI, 
quickly and early. Once this ideal moment of action 
is identified, it is necessary to have the cells ready for 
injection, requiring very well structured logistics and 
making it difficult to use autologous cells (due to the 
time of preparation and expansion in culture).
Compatibility between injected cells and receptors
Despite the well-established notion of MHC-II 
expression by MSCs, further understanding of the 
mechanisms related to the immune privilege or im￾munosuppression ability of MSCs is needed, which 
may be crucial for the successful integration of cells 
into the patient and the success of the therapy, as it 
happens in cases of bone marrow transplantation. 
This knowledge is even more necessary in the clini￾cal setting, which often requires multiple dose appli￾cations to achieve the expected outcome in chronic 
diseases.
In favour of the use of autologous MSCs, a me￾ta-analysis in heart failure patients favoured in￾creased exercise capacity, left ventricular ejection 
fraction, quality of life and reduced mortality and 
hospital readmission rates39. In another meta-analy￾sis, treatment with whole bone marrow autologous 
cells (dose ranged from 382.6±107
 to 2.8±1.9x109
) was 
effective for reducing glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) 
by 1.18% and for reducing the need for insulin at 3, 6, 
9 and 12 months after treatment40.
There is recent evidence that allogeneic MSCs 
would be as effective as autologous MSCs in improv￾ing the final diastolic volume and left ventricular 
ejection fraction of patients with ischemic cardio￾myopathy15. Importantly, allogeneic MSCs did not 
promote immune response at the receptors. In renal 
transplant patients, injections of autologous18 and al￾logeneic26 MSCs were also considered safe.
 
Understanding the specific action mechanisms of 
different MSCs types
There is a lack of skill specification data that 
MSCs present according to their tissue origin, for the 
proper adaptation of the cell type to the clinical pic￾ture to be applied. Important qualifications of MSCs 
such as cell-type differentiation of damaged target 
tissue, immunosuppression and anti-inflammatory 
action have been tested in vitro and do not necessar￾ily accurately predict actual clinical potency in each 
scenario. An interesting study has shown that for the 
immunosuppressive action of MSCs in patients with 
host disease against donor, cytotoxic immune attack 
of the host patient against injected MSCs is essential, 
inducing them to apoptosis. Patients who responded 
best to therapy were the ones with the highest cy￾totoxicity against injected MSCs. According to the 
evaluation of the existing literature, the decision of 
the moment of injection of the cells determines the 
microenvironment that they will find. MSCs, in re￾sponse to the inflammatory microenvironment, ac￾tivate their own anti-inflammatory mechanisms, de￾fining the resultant patient-cell therapy interaction. 
This may explain some negative results obtained by 
clinical trials. For example, patients who received 
MSCs prior to kidney transplantation showed no 
difference from the control group in relation to the 
common adverse effects of the procedure, which can 
be explained by the microenvironment without the 
inflammatory IR insult installed and, consequently, 
the lack of activation of MSCs to the anti-inflamma￾tory pattern41.
Monitoring patients beforehand in order to identi￾fy these more responsive subgroups and understand 
the timing of the most appropriate pathogenesis for 
cell administration is extremely valuable in achiev￾ing the desired efficacy of the therapy.
Data from clinical trials are in progress
Most clinical studies are based on safety and effi￾cacy outcomes and are not designed with large num￾bers of patients and have heterogeneity in injection 
dose and frequency. However, the occurrence of ad￾verse events after treatment with MSCs does not ap￾pear to be different from the control group.
Cell dose per individual: uncertainties
There is a detrimental mismatch between data 
from preclinical and clinical studies regarding the ap￾propriate amount for cell therapy with MSCs. Com￾monly, in rodents, the intravenous dose is 50 million/
kg/weight. In humans, MSCs are usually transfused 
around 1-2 million/kg/ weight. However, weight ad￾justment may not be the best measure for comparing 
humans and rodents for therapeutic perspectives. 
Even so, considering that they respect the same bio￾logical mechanism of action and that the effects are 

SÁVIO-SILVA, C. ET AL.
53 REV ASSOC MED BRAS 2020; 66(SUPPL 1):S:45-S54 
dose-dependent, this difference in methodology im￾poses a negative bias in clinical practice due to the 
lower dose used in humans.
Administration route: more effective biodistribution 
for the desired outcome
There is still no consensus on the best route of 
injection of MSCs in preclinical and clinical trials, 
and the intravenous route is widely used. Depend￾ing on the choice, there is a different dynamics of 
cell distribution in the body, affecting the mecha￾nism of action and possibly the clinical outcome. 
Among the options, some choices have practical 
methodological ease in the routine application and 
also in the transition to clinical use, such as the 
extravascular (intraperitoneal, intramuscular and 
subcutaneous) pathways. Testing these pathways, 
it has already been shown that MSCs, when acting 
in a systemic manner, also end up benefiting the or￾gan affected by the disease in question, even with 
the distance42.
Regulated clean room
It is necessary to define production standards ac￾cording to the disease and the type of patient. Iso￾lation method, culture time and environment com￾position can all affect the potency and quality of the 
final product of MSCs. It is suggested that MSCs be 
injected until passage (P)2, when the amount of cells 
obtained is also sufficient. It is still necessary to con￾sider the costs and complexity of these processes, 
and it is extremely important to evaluate measures 
that enable large-scale production at low cost, as it is 
done in the processes of blood transfusion centres.
One of the challenges of cell therapy with MSCs 
is a better understanding of the occurrence of chro￾mosomal alterations, which, although rare (n=1/152), 
leads to the disposal of MSCs43. Thus, the genomic 
integrity of MSCs, assessed by karyotype, should al￾ways be considered, although the ideal moment, if 
soon after cell collection, in which passage or before 
infusion, is still a matter of debate.
Finally, the additional characterization of 
MSC manufactured products is essential for a better 
understanding of the phenotypic characteristics and 
their subpopulations, as well as for the evaluation of 
their therapeutic potential.
CONCLUSIONS 
Cellular therapy with MSCs has benefits in pre￾clinical studies of AKI through various mechanisms, 
such as anti-inflammatory, antiapoptotic, oxidative 
anti-stress, antifibrotic, immunomodulatory and pro￾angiogenic. Such benefits may also explain many of 
the positive effects of that therapy on humans.
