Background/Aims: The diagnosis of immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is based 
on clinical manifestations and there is no gold standard. Thus, even hematologic 
malignancy is sometimes misdiagnosed as ITP and adequate treatment is de￾layed. Therefore, novel diagnostic parameters are needed to distinguish ITP from 
other causes of thrombocytopenia. Immature platelet fraction (IPF) has been pro￾posed as one of new parameters. In this study, we assessed the usefulness of IPF 
and developed a diagnostic predictive scoring model for ITP.
Methods: We retrospectively studied 568 patients with thrombocytopenia. Blood 
samples were collected and IPF quantified using a fully-automated hematology 
analyzer. We also estimated other variables that could affect thrombocytopenia by 
logistic regression analysis.
Results: The median IPF was significantly higher in the ITP group than in the 
non-ITP group (8.7% vs. 5.1%). The optimal cut-off value of IPF for differentiating 
ITP was 7.0%. We evaluated other laboratory variables via logistic regression anal￾ysis. IPF, hemoglobin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and ferritin were statistically 
significant and comprised a diagnostic predictive scoring model. Our model gave 
points to each of variables: 1 to high hemoglobin (> 12 g/dL), low ferritin (≤ 177 ng/
mL), normal LDH (≤ upper limit of normal) and IPF ≥ 7 and < 10, 2 to IPF ≥ 10. 
The final score was obtained by summing the points. We defined that ITP could 
be predicted in patients with more than 3 points.
Conclusions: IPF could be a useful parameter to distinguish ITP from other caus￾es of thrombocytopenia. We developed the predictive scoring model. This model 
could predict ITP with high probability.

INTRODUCTION
Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an immune-medi￾ated acquired disease characterized by isolated throm￾bocytopenia [1]. ITP is usually considered a benign dis￾ease with no excess mortality compared to the general 
population. However, some patients did not respond to 
numerous treatments and suffered from a fatal hem￾orrhage or infection related to immunosuppressive 
therapy [2]. Although the exact mechanism of thrombo￾cytopenia is unclear, it is now known to be associated 
with increased platelet destruction by a complex im￾mune-mediated process [3]. ITP can be diagnosed based 
on history, physical examination, laboratory variables,

and other causes of thrombocytopenia should be ex￾cluded. Patients with ITP show unremarkable periph￾eral blood smear morphology and physical examination 
except various bleeding manifestations [4]. Since there 
are no other definite laboratory or clinical parameters 
for the diagnosis of ITP [1], even aplastic anemia or he￾matologic malignancy is sometimes misdiagnosed as 
ITP and adequate treatment is delayed. Therefore, phy￾sicians are forced to consider bone marrow examination 
in a significant number of patients with severe throm￾bocytopenia in practice, unlike previous studies which 
assert that a routine bone marrow examination is not 
necessary for diagnosis [5,6]. Since both physicians and 
patients are reluctant to perform an invasive and pain￾ful bone marrow examination, other parameters such as 
immature platelet fraction (IPF) have been proposed to 
differentiate thrombocytopenia instead of bone marrow 
examination. 
Reticulated platelets have been studied as a parame￾ter in the evaluation of thrombocytopenia for decades. 
Reticulated platelets are the immature, youngest plate￾lets released into the circulation by regenerated marrow 
megakaryocytes and reflect the rate of platelet turnover 
similar to reticulocytes of red blood cells [7-9]. Retic￾ulated platelets contain a greater amount of RNA [10], 
and can be measured by flow cytometric analysis using 
the fluorescent dye which binds to their RNA [7]. Sever￾al researchers have improved flow cytometric methods; 
however, flow cytometry still has various limitations 
such as being time consuming, difficult sample prepa￾ration, requiring a skilled operator, high costs, and lack 
of quality control [11]. Therefore, Watanabe et al. [12] de￾scribed a fully automated measurement of reticulated 
platelets, and several studies showed that the automated 
measurement of immature platelets using the hematol￾ogy analyzer XE-2100 (Sysmex, Kobe, Japan) is clinically 
applicable [13-20].
 Because a high IPF value is associated with increased 
platelet production [15], we can presume that ITP can be 
differentiated from thrombocytopenia due to marrow 
failure by using IPF. Some studies have shown that IPF 
could be used to make a differential diagnosis between 
ITP and other diseases causing thrombocytopenia (non￾ITP thrombocytopenia), such as bone marrow diseases, 
liver diseases and bone marrow suppression after che￾motherapy. Briggs et al. [15] confirmed reproducibili￾ty and stability of IPF using the Sysmex XE-2100, and 
suggested IPF as a parameter of bone marrow mega￾karyocyte activity. Abe et al. [13] and Pons et al. [20] also 
concluded IPF could be a useful marker to discriminate 
causes of thrombocytopenia. However, there have been 
only a few small-scale studies, and exact cut-off value, 
sensitivity and specificity of IPF have not yet been de￾termined. In addition, since there are other causes of 
thrombocytopenia with increased platelet turnover, it is 
impossible to distinguish ITP patients exactly with IPF 
alone. Therefore, other parameters to complement IPF 
should be evaluated.
In this study, we compared IPF in patients with ITP 
and patients with thrombocytopenia of other causes to 
assess its usefulness as a differentiating parameter in 
thrombocytopenia. We also estimated other laboratory 
variables which can be combined with IPF to improve 
the diagnostic accuracy of ITP and developed a diagnos￾tic predictive scoring model for ITP.
METHODS
Patients
We retrospectively studied 568 patients with thrombo￾cytopenia (platelet count < 100 × 109/L) of various causes 
who presented to Korea University Guro Hospital from 
April 2013 to December 2017. We classified the patients 
into two groups: those diagnosed with ITP (ITP group) 
and those diagnosed with other causes of thrombocy￾topenia apart from ITP (non-ITP group). ITP was diag￾nosed on the basis of clinical manifestations and labo￾ratory results, according to the International Working 
Group diagnostic criteria [1], but some patients un￾derwent bone marrow examination for differential di￾agnosis. Causes of thrombocytopenia other than ITP 
included the following: primary bone marrow diseases 
like aplastic anemia, acute leukemia, multiple myeloma, 
and myelodysplastic syndrome, infection, drugs, dis￾seminated intravascular coagulation, and liver diseases, 
etc. The Korea University Hospital Institutional Review 
Board approved the protocol of this study (2019GR0072). 
Informed consent was waived by the board.
Measurement of IPF and other variables
We collected 3 mL of peripheral blood from each patient

in K2-EDTA anticoagulant bottles (Becton Dickinson, 
Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) on the day of thrombocyto￾penia confirmation. Samples were analyzed using the 
Sysmex XE-2100 to quantify IPF and routine complete 
blood count within 8 hours after collection. The Sysmex 
XE-2100 is a fully-automated hematology analyzer using 
fluorescent dye and a semiconductor diode laser beam 
system. Two fluorescent dyes (polymethine and ozazine) 
penetrate into the cells, staining the RNA in the plate￾lets. The stained cells are passed through a semiconduc￾tor diode laser beam and resulting forward scatter light 
(cell volume) and fluorescence intensity (RNA content) 
measured. The immature platelet fractions are distin￾guished by the intensity of their fluorescence because 
the youngest platelets contain a greater amount of RNA 
[15]. The IPF is expressed as a proportional value of the 
total optical platelet count. Several studies have demon￾strated the stability and reproducibility of the IPF. 
We also estimated other variables that could affect 
thrombocytopenia by logistic regression analysis, in￾cluding hemoglobin, platelet count, white blood cell 
counts, reticulocyte count, protein, albumin, bilirubin, 
prothrombin, activated partial thromboplastin time, 
ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), blood urea nitro￾gen, creatinine, and C-reactive protein.
Statistical analysis
All the data were statistically analyzed using SPSS ver￾sion 20 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). For continuous 
variables, the Student’s t test and the Mann-Whitney 
test were applied to compare statistical differences be￾tween the two groups. We used a chi-square test or Fish￾er’s exact test for comparisons of categorical variables. 
We used receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves 
to determine the cut-off value of IPF at the best sensi￾tivity and specificity and the area under the curve was 
calculated. Logistic regression analysis with the labora￾tory variables was performed to access their diagnostic 
contribution. A p values less than 0.05 were considered 
statistically significant. 
RESULTS
Patients’ characteristics
A total of 568 patients with thrombocytopenia (platelet 
count less than 100 × 109/L) were evaluated in this study. 
Of these, 206 were diagnosed with ITP according to 
the definitions proposed by the International Working 
Group, and 362 were classified as having thrombocyto￾penia due to causes other than ITP. The most common 
cause of thrombocytopenia in the non-ITP group was 
primary bone marrow diseases (n = 132), followed by in￾fection (n = 69), drugs (n = 56), liver disease (n = 40), dis￾seminated intravascular coagulation (n = 30), and others 
(n = 35) including chronic kidney disease, other autoim￾mune diseases, megaloblastic anemia, and bone marrow 
involvement of other cancers (Table 1). 
IPF and laboratory results
The baseline laboratory data of the ITP group and non￾ITP group were compared in Table 2. The ITP group 
had a significantly higher hemoglobin concentration (p < 
0.001), white blood cell count (p < 0.001), and lower LDH 
(p < 0.001), ferritin level (p < 0.001). The median IPF (%) 
was significantly higher in the ITP group; the median 
IPF (%) (range) of the ITP group was 8.7% (1.3% to 47.5%) 
while that of the non-ITP group was 5.1% (0.7% to 31.5%) 
(p < 0.001). In order to obtain the optimal cut-off value of 
IPF (%) for the diagnosis of ITP, ROC curve analysis was 
carried out. As a result, the optimal cut-off value of IPF 
(%) for differentiating ITP was 7.0% with a sensitivity of 
61% and a specificity of 70% (Fig. 1A). Bone marrow ex￾aminations are not mandatory for the diagnosis of ITP, 
but some patients who have clinically diagnosed ITP 
without a bone marrow examination may be difficult 
to differentiate from those with early bone marrow dis￾ease. To exclude this possibility of misclassification, we 
performed subgroup analysis with the patients who had 
an accurate diagnosis with bone marrow examination. A 
total of 200 patients underwent bone marrow examina￾tion; 77 patients were classified into the ITP group and 
123 patients into the non-ITP group. The median IPF 
(%) was significantly higher in the ITP group. The me￾dian IPF (%) (range) was 12.5% (1.9% to 45.7%) for the ITP 
group and 4.7% (0.7% to 31.5%) for the non-ITP group. 
The optimal cut-off value was 7.8%, with a sensitivity 
of 75% and a specificity of 76.7% (Fig. 1B). The median 
IPF was higher in this subgroup and the sensitivity and 
specificity of the cut-off value were also higher than the 
former group. We confirmed that IPF could be a useful 
parameter for diagnosing ITP, but since IPF alone could

not be used to diagnose ITP, we also evaluated other lab￾oratory variables via logistic regression analysis. Hemo￾globin, LDH, and ferritin showed statistical significance 
with p < 0.001, p = 0.011, and p < 0.001, respectively. The 
optimal cut-off value of hemoglobin for distinguishing 
between ITP and non-ITP was 12 g/dL with a sensitivity 
of 60% and specificity of 81.3%. The optimal cut-off val￾ue of LDH was 420 IU/L (upper limit of normal [ULN]) 
with sensitivity 57.9%, specificity 70.5% and the cut-off 
value of ferritin was 177 mg/mL with sensitivity 67%, 
specificity 83.3% (Fig. 2).
Derivation of predictive model
These four independent variables which were identi￾fied through the logistic regression analysis comprised 
a simple diagnostic predictive scoring model (Table 3). 
To adequately reflect sensitivity and specificity, we di￾vided patients into three groups according to IPF; IPF 
< 7, ≥ 7 and < 10, ≥ 10. Our model gave point to each of 
variables; 1 to high hemoglobin level (> 12 g/dL), low fer￾ritin level (≤ 177 ng/mL), normal LDH level (≤ ULN) and 
IPF ≥ 7 and < 10; and 2 to IPF ≥ 10. The final score was 
obtained by summing the points (Table 4). The scoring 
model underwent validation. In the internal validation 
cohort consisting of patients who underwent bone mar￾row examination, a total of 166 patients had all variables 
of the scoring system. Sixty-four patients were diag￾nosed with ITP and 102 patients were diagnosed with

to Korea University Guro Hospital from January 2018 
to December 2018 or Korea University Anam Hospital 
from January 2017 to December 2018. A total of 171 pa￾tients who underwent bone marrow examination had 
all variables and could be scored. Twenty-nine patients 
were diagnosed with ITP and 142 patients were diag￾nosed as non-ITP. None of 29 patients with ITP were 
assigned a score of 0 to 1; 26 patients (89.7%) were as￾signed a score of 3 to 5. We also found that ITP could 
be highly predicted in patients with more than 3 points. 
Accuracy, precision and recall were 91%, 67%, and 90%, 
respectively. 
DISCUSSION
The purpose of this study is to find novel markers to di￾agnose ITP more easily and accurately, because there is 
no gold standard method for diagnosis of ITP so far. In 
this study, we investigated the usefulness of IPF (%) for 
the differential diagnosis of ITP and found that IPF (%) 
is significantly higher in ITP patients than in the non￾ITP group. The role of IPF has been reported in sever￾al studies. Briggs et al. [15] showed that IPF is higher in 
ITP and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, which 
are associated with excessive peripheral consumption of 
platelets than in the group undergoing cytotoxic che￾motherapy. Jung et al. [17] confirmed that the median 
IPF (%) of ITP patients is 7.7%, that of AA patients is 3.5% 
and the cut-off value of IPF differentiating ITP from AA 
was 7.3%. Naz et al. [21] compared the IPF (%) of ITP pa￾tients with other thrombocytopenic patients and normal 
healthy adults and observed that IPF (%) was higher in 
the ITP group than in the non-ITP group. These stud￾ies presented a similar conclusion that IPF (%) might be 
a diagnostic parameter of patients with ITP; however, 
these have several limitations as follows. (1) They mainly 
compared the IPF (%) of patients with ITP and that of 
normal control groups without thrombocytopenia, and 
the size of the control groups with thrombocytopenia 
were too small. (2) There were no studies comparing 
the IPF (%) in patients with and without bone marrow 
examination. Since most studies did not use bone mar￾row examination for the diagnosis of ITP, some patients 
might have been misdiagnosed as ITP. (3) The criterion 
for thrombocytopenia was platelet count less than 150 × 
109/L, which was inconsistent with the criteria from the 
International Working Group.
In this study, we included 568 patients with platelet 
count less than 10 × 109/L for both the ITP and non￾ITP groups. Even though only patients with less than 
100,000 platelets were included in the study, the study 
was conducted on a relatively large number of patients 
compared to previous studies. Bone marrow examina￾tions were not performed in all patients, but we per￾formed bone marrow examination in almost half of 
patients for diagnosis and clearly excluded the possi￾bility of other diseases. In this way, since other cause 
of thrombocytopenia was excluded in a large number 
of patients with bone marrow examination, our study 
diagnosed ITP more accurately compared to previous 
studies. IPF could be expressed as an absolute count or 
a percentage. We used the IPF (%) because the absolute 
value of immature platelets may also be low if the plate￾let count is low. The median IPF (%) for patients with 
ITP was significantly higher compared to that of the 
non-ITP group. Therefore, our result indicated that IPF 
(%) could be applied as a useful parameter to distinguish 
the cause of thrombocytopenia, especially in the diagno￾sis of ITP. The optimal cut-off value to differentiate ITP 
from other causes of thrombocytopenia was 7.0%, with 
a sensitivity of 61% and a specificity of 70%. These are 
similar results to those of previous studies. Since ITP is 
diagnosed through the exclusion of other diseases, the 
initial diagnosis may not be accurate, especially, in pa￾tients with several underlying diseases or with a short 
follow-up period. Therefore, some patients who did not 
undergo bone marrow examination could be misdi￾agnosed with ITP and consequently misclassified into 
the ITP group in our study. To exclude the possibility 
of misclassification, only patients who underwent bone 
marrow examination were selected and included in the 
subgroup analysis. In this subgroup, the median IPF (%) 
for patients with ITP was also higher than that of the 
non-ITP group and the difference was even more pro￾nounced. The optimal cut-off value for differentiating 
ITP from other causes of thrombocytopenia was 7.9%, 
with a sensitivity of 75% and specificity of 76.7%. 
However, diagnosing ITP with IPF alone has some 
limitations. Although ITP is mainly attributed to im￾mune-mediated platelet destruction, recently, inade-

quate platelet production has also been suggested as 
a factor in the pathogenesis of ITP [3,22]. Also, ITP is 
considered a heterogeneous disease, as the etiology of 
thrombocytopenia differs among patients. IPF reflects 
only young platelet production, and cannot fully reflect 
the complicated pathogenesis of ITP. In addition, IPF 
may be similar in other diseases like liver disease with 
splenomegaly, according to the mechanism of throm￾bocytopenia. Furthermore, as platelets have a shorter 
lifespan relative to red blood cells, fluctuations and vari￾ations of IPF (%) might be larger, depending on the time 
of the test. Therefore, we also measured other laboratory 
variables to overcome the limitation of IPF and improve 
the diagnostic accuracy of ITP. Hemoglobin, LDH, and 
ferritin showed statistical significance in the logistic 
regression analysis. Low hemoglobin, high LDH, and 
high ferritin level were found to be associated with the 
non-ITP group. These may be attributable to the fact 
that the non-ITP group included patients with various 
bone marrow diseases. LDH and ferritin are also known 
as acute phase reactants, the levels of which can be in￾creased by inflammation and tissue damage. Moreover, 
ferritin can be released from damaged hepatocytes and 
indirectly reflects liver damage. We developed a simple 
scoring model for the differential diagnosis of ITP based 
on these results and found it to assess the probability of 
ITP reliably. Because our predictive model consists of 
common laboratory variables that are frequently used in 
general clinical practice, we expect that it could be easily 
applied to patients in clinical practice instead of bone 
marrow examination.
In conclusion, IPF (%) could be a useful parameter to 
distinguish ITP from thrombocytopenia of other caus￾es. Though IPF (%) alone is hardly a gold standard for 
the diagnosis of ITP, it could be more useful in combi￾nation with other laboratory variables. We developed a 
predictive scoring model for the differential diagnosis 
of ITP using IPF (%), hemoglobin, LDH, and ferritin. 
External validation with a large cohort of patients is 
needed to determine the efficacy of this model.

KEY MESSAGE
1. Immature platelet fraction (IPF) could be a use￾ful parameter to distinguish immune throm￾bocytopenic purpura (ITP) from other causes 
of thrombocytopenia. 
2. We developed the predictive scoring model 
using IPF, hemoglobin, lactate dehydrogenase, 
and ferritin. This model could predict ITP 
with high probability in patients with more 
than 3 points.
