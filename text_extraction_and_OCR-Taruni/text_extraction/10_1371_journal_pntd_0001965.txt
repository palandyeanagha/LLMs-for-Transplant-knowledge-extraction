Abstract: Immunosuppression, which has become an
increasingly relevant clinical condition in the last 50 years,
modifies the natural history of Trypanosoma cruzi
infection in most patients with Chagas disease. The main
goal in this setting is to prevent the consequences of
reactivation of T. cruzi infection by close monitoring. We
analyze the relationship between Chagas disease and
three immunosuppressant conditions, including a de￾scription of clinical cases seen at our center, a brief review
of the literature, and recommendations for the manage￾ment of these patients based on our experience and on
the data in the literature. T. cruzi infection is considered an
opportunistic parasitic infection indicative of AIDS, and
clinical manifestations of reactivation are more severe
than in acute Chagas disease. Parasitemia is the most
important defining feature of reactivation. Treatment with
benznidazole and/or nifurtimox is strongly recommended
in such cases. It seems reasonable to administer
trypanocidal treatment only to asymptomatic immuno￾suppressed patients with detectable parasitemia, and/or
patients with clinically defined reactivation. Specific
treatment for Chagas disease does not appear to be
related to a higher incidence of neoplasms, and a direct
role of T. cruzi in the etiology of neoplastic disease has not
been confirmed. Systemic immunosuppressive diseases or
immunosuppressants can modify the natural course of T.
cruzi infection. Immunosuppressive doses of corticoste￾roids have not been associated with higher rates of
reactivation of Chagas disease. Despite a lack of evidence￾based data, treatment with benznidazole or nifurtimox
should be initiated before immunosuppression where
possible to reduce the risk of reactivation. Timely
antiparasitic treatment with benznidazole and nifurtimox
(or with posaconazole in cases of therapeutic failure) has
proven to be highly effective in preventing Chagas
disease reactivation, even if such treatment has not been
formally incorporated into management protocols for
immunosuppressed patients. International consensus
guidelines based on expert opinion would greatly
contribute to standardizing the management of immu￾nosuppressed patients with Chagas disease.
Introduction
Immunosuppression has gained increasing clinical relevance in
the last 50 years. The list of neoplastic and systemic diseases that
cause immunosuppression is increasing, as is the use of new
immunosuppressive drugs. Furthermore, the exponential increase
in the incidence of AIDS cases in the last 30 years has contributed
to a significant increase in the number of immunosuppressed
patients [1].
In most cases, immunosuppression modifies the natural history
of other diseases, predisposing patients to the development or
reactivation of opportunistic infections, with special, and often
severe, clinical features [2]. The management of emerging
infectious diseases, often unfamiliar to the clinician, becomes
relevant in this context.
One of the most prevalent parasitic infections that has spread
from Latin America to non-endemic areas such as the United
States, Canada, and Europe is Chagas disease, or American
trypanosomiasis [3,4]. Its etiological agent, Trypanosoma cruzi, has
not traditionally been considered an opportunistic agent, but in
recent decades there have been many reports of reactivation in
immunocompromised patients (mainly those with AIDS) [5–7].
With increasing migratory flows from poor, rural areas to large
cities and developed, non-endemic countries, a growing number of
patients with chronic Chagas disease are being diagnosed with
other conditions that cause immunosuppression or require
treatment with immunosuppressants; under these conditions,
reactivation of the parasite is a likely outcome [5].
Reactivation is defined as an increase in parasitemia that can be
detected by direct parasitological and/or PCR techniques, even in
the absence of clinical symptoms [8]. The appearance of
symptoms represents a worsening of the underlying disease. The
most common symptoms of Chagas disease reactivation are
subcutaneous nodules (chagoma), panniculitis, myocarditis with
signs of heart failure, fever, meningitis, encephalitis, and stroke [9–
12], but other symptoms, such as fatigue, anorexia, and diarrhea,
are also seen [13]. In cases of reactivation, timely antiparasitic
treatment with benznidazole has proven to be highly effective [14–
16]. Several guidelines for the treatment of immunosuppressed

patients with Chagas disease have been published recently [17–
20], but there is no international consensus on the management of
reactivation in these patients. While treatment with benznidazole
is highly effective in reactivations [16,21], it has not been formally
incorporated into the management protocols of HIV/AIDS [22].
In this article we describe our experience with three immuno￾suppressive conditions (HIV infection, neoplastic disease, and
systemic autoimmune disease) in patients with T. cruzi infection
and provide some practical recommendations for the management
of these patients based on our experience and a review of the
literature. The aim is to contribute to the pool of knowledge in this
area and to help improve the quality of care of patients with T.
cruzi infection and any of the immunosuppressive conditions
analyzed.
Methods
We analyzed three immunosuppressive conditions in patients
with T. cruzi infection: HIV/AIDS, neoplastic disease, and systemic
autoimmune disease. For each category, we have included a review
of the relevant literature, a description of all the clinical cases seen at
our clinical care center between June 2007 and December 2010,
and some recommendations for management based on our
experience and the data in the literature.
The cases were diagnosed and treated at a specialist facility for
the management of Chagas disease at the International Health
Centre of Hospital Clı´nic in Barcelona, Spain. Screening for all
patients includes T. cruzi and HIV tests, and general analyses.
Of 1,310 patients screened in the study period, T. cruzi infection
was diagnosed in 715 patients. Of these, three had concomitant
HIV infection, five had a neoplastic disease, and three had a
systemic autoimmune disorder.
According to our in-hospital protocol for Chagas disease, all the
patients signed informed consent before blood collection for
diagnosis and before initiation of treatment with benznidazole.
The therapeutic regimen in all cases was 5 mg/kg/day of
benznidazole for 60 days.
The literature search was performed in the MEDLINE database
using the terms Chagas disease and T. cruzi, with the subheadings
immunosuppression, HIV, systemic diseases, systemic lupus erythematosus,
rheumatoid arthritis, reactivation, neoplasia, corticoids, chemotherapy,
benznidazole, nifurtimox, PCR, and management.
Results and Discussion
Coinfection with T. cruzi and HIV
Review of the literature. T. cruzi infection has been
classified as an AIDS-defining opportunistic parasitosis by the
US Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention since 2004 [23].
Considering the increasing number of cases of Chagas disease
reactivation and the severity of the pathological manifestations
associated with reactivation in patients with a low CD4+ T-cell
count (usually ,200 cells/mL) [9,24–27], it is particularly
important to consider T. cruzi infection as a potential opportunistic
parasitic infection in patients in or from Chagas disease–endemic
countries.
Even in asymptomatic patients, T. cruzi parasitemia is higher in
those with concomitant HIV infection than in those without [28–
30], and specific treatment with benznidazole or nifurtimox is
recommended in such cases. The persistent immune activation
induced by T. cruzi has been related to a sustained increase in HIV
replication, with several studies showing an increase in plasma
HIV-1 viral load in patients with parasitemia, indicating
reactivation of T. cruzi infection [8,15].
Reactivation in immunosuppressed patients is usually associated
with more severe clinical manifestations (e.g., central nervous
system [CNS] involvement, chagomas, meningoencephalitis, and
severe myocarditis) than those observed in immunocompetent
patients with acute Chagas disease [15,26]. CNS infection by T.
cruzi is more common than myocardial damage in HIV￾immunosuppressed patients [6,7,15,16]. Space-occupying lesions
in the white matter of the brain are the most common clinical
finding, but meningitis and meningoencephalitis may also occur
[31]. CNS involvement was reported in 75%–80% of patients with
concomitant T. cruzi and HIV infection between 1990 (when del
Castillo et al. [19] described the first case of a young man with
HIV infection and a lesion in the right frontal lobe with
inflammatory perivascular infiltrates and clusters of T. cruzi
amastigotes) and 2007 [13,26,32–40].
Cardiac compromise is the second most prevalent manifestation
of reactivated Chagas disease, occurring in 25%–44% of patients
coinfected with T. cruzi and HIV [26,37,41–43]. The most
common cardiac manifestation is myocarditis, sometimes as a
major presentation, but usually with CNS involvement masking
heart involvement [29,44]. Isolated reports of reactivation in other
organs, such as the gastrointestinal tract, pericardium [26],
peritoneum [45], skin [46], and cervix uteri [47], have been
published.
Our experience. The epidemiological and clinical charac￾teristics of the three patients with T. cruzi and HIV infection are
shown in Tables 1 and 2, together with details of treatment and
follow-up. Reactivation was not observed in any of the patients,
but it should be noted that their CD4+ T-cell count remained
above 200 cells/mL throughout follow-up.
Recommendations for management. HIV-positive pa￾tients with moderate immunosuppression and latent Chagas
disease are usually asymptomatic, and parasitemia normally
increases before the appearance of symptoms [45]. Nevertheless,
treatment with benznidazole or nifurtimox should be initiated as
soon as any symptoms of T. cruzi infection reactivation are noted,
even in the absence of an increase in parasitemia [7,15,31,48].
Direct microscopic examination of blood and cerebrospinal fluid
may reveal the presence of T. cruzi trypomastigotes, which usually,
but not always, precedes clinical manifestations [49]. Parasitolog￾ical and/or PCR follow-up are thus mandatory in patients with
HIV infection [50].
In some patients with myocardial involvement, the clinical
manifestations are heart failure and arrhythmias, but findings from
autopsy studies suggest that a significant proportion of patients
with Chagas disease and HIV/AIDS have clinically silent cardiac
disease, even though they have inflammatory foci associated with
T. cruzi–infected cardiomyocytes [21,40].
Brain imaging techniques are theoretically useful for exploring
CNS involvement, but considering the lack of specificity of brain
imaging and the large variability in the space occupied by T. cruzi–
induced lesions in individuals with AIDS, a brain biopsy provides
better guarantees of accurate diagnosis and appropriate therapy.
Histopathologic examination of the space-occupying lesions of the
brain shows severe inflammation in association with heavily
parasitized glial cells and occasionally neurons [21].
Specific treatment with benznidazole or nifurtimox is recom￾mended when there is strong evidence of T. cruzi infection
reactivation. The recommendation grade is AII (treatment should
always be offered) in patients with reactivated T. cruzi infection and
HIV/AIDS or another immunosuppressive disorder, and BII
(treatment should generally be offered) in those with impending
immunosuppression [51]. Despite a lack of evidence-based data,
T. cruzi–specific treatment should be considered at the moment of

HIV diagnosis, prior to severe immunosuppression, in order to
prevent or minimize the risk of Chagas disease reactivation.
The duration of Chagas therapy has not been standardized in
HIV/AIDS, but some groups recommend maintaining treatment
throughout immunosuppression [13], as is done in many patients
with Chagas disease who undergo organ transplantation. Specific
chemotherapy in Chagas disease is still unsatisfactory, and while
benznidazole and nifurtimox can be effective in reducing parasitemia,
controlling clinical manifestations, and reducing mortality (and
thereby improving prognosis) during reactivations in immunocom￾promised individuals, they have frequent adverse side effects and
limited capacity for achieving a parasitological cure; such facts should
be taken in account to decide the length of treatment [29,52].
Summary. T. cruzi infection is an opportunistic parasitic
infection indicative of AIDS. Clinical manifestations are more
severe in reactivation than in acute Chagas disease, and usually
involve the CNS. Parasitemia should be considered the most
important defining feature of reactivation, because it usually
increases before the onset of symptoms. Treatment with
benznidazole and/or nifurtimox is strongly recommended in cases
of clinical and/or parasitological suspicion of reactivation.
Pharmacological Immunosuppression: Neoplastic
Disease in Individuals with T. cruzi Infection
Review of the literature. Little is known about the
relationship between the incidence of neoplastic disease and T.
cruzi infection, or about whether the immune response induced by
this infection modifies the development or location of neoplasms.
The relationship between immunosuppression and neoplastic
disease in patients with T. cruzi infection has been analyzed from
three perspectives: 1) neoplastic disease as a potential immuno￾suppressive condition that increases the likelihood of reactivation
of infection; 2) neoplastic disease occurring as a result of treatment
with benznidazole, either alone or combined with immunosup￾pressive drugs; and 3) neoplastic disease as a condition that is
potentially more common in patients with Chagas disease.
In our opinion, the most relevant issue regarding the association
between neoplastic disease and Chagas disease is the potential for
T. cruzi reactivation and the management of this reactivation in
order to prevent serious consequences.
Based on clinical observations, some authors have speculated as
to whether benznidazole treatment in immunosuppressed patients
might actually cause neoplasms [10,53]. However, several clinical
studies with long follow-up have found no evidence of a higher
incidence of histological signs of malignancy in such patients
[11,52,54]. The conclusions of these studies are clear: benznidazole
is not related to the development of neoplasms and the association
between benznidazole and other immunosuppressive drugs does not
contribute to an increased incidence of neoplastic disease.
A higher prevalence of esophageal carcinoma and uterine cervix
leiomyoma has been reported in patients with chronic Chagas
disease than in individuals without T. cruzi infection [55].
Esophageal carcinoma is more common in patients with Chagas
disease and megaesophagus than in those without Chagas disease
[56], but a similar prevalence has been reported in patients
without megaesophagus, regardless of whether or not they have
Chagas disease [56]. The association between esophageal carci￾noma and Chagas disease in patients with megaesophagus is
probably a consequence of the chronic esophagitis caused by
alimentary stasis. Although some clinical studies have claimed an
association between megacolon due to Chagas disease and colon
cancer [57,58], an experimental study in mice with chagasic
megacolon, where fecal stasis was observed, failed to reveal a
higher incidence of colon cancer [59]
Our experience. In our series, four patients with T. cruzi
infection had bone marrow cancer and one had breast adenocar￾cinoma. The characteristics of the patients and the diseases are
summarized in Table 3. Two of the patients died, one due to
myeloid acute leukemia and the other due to lymph node
metastasis from primary breast adenocarcinoma. None of the
patients had clinical evidence of reactivation during follow-up.
Recommendations for management. Reactivation of T.
cruzi infection must be considered in patients with chronic Chagas
disease and neoplastic disease requiring intensive or long-term
pharmacological immunosuppression. It is not possible, however,
to make a general evidence-based recommendation for the
management of such patients or for the prevention of reactivation.
The risks of toxicity associated with trypanocidal treatment are
well known and efficacy in patients with chronic disease is variable
and limited, which renders risk/benefit analyses difficult. Based on
reports in the literature and on our experience, it would seem
reasonable to administer trypanocidal treatment only to asymp￾tomatic immunosuppressed patients with detectable parasitemia
(Strout method or PCR) at the moment of evaluation, or to
patients with clinically defined reactivation. Trypanocidal treat￾ment at the moment of diagnosis and prior to immunosuppression
might minimize the risk of reactivation, but this indication is
controversial and is not supported by evidence-based data.
Experience in this area is limited to isolated case reports and series.
Summary. Specific treatment for Chagas disease does not
appear to be related to a higher incidence of neoplasms, and a
direct role of T. cruzi in the etiology of neoplastic disease has not
been confirmed. Reactivation, however, might be an unavoidable
consequence of immunosuppressive treatment. Patients with T.
cruzi infection who need immunosuppressive therapy must thus be
closely followed, and treatment with benznidazole or nifurtimox is
strongly recommended in cases of confirmed reactivation.
Systemic Autoimmune Disease and Chagas Disease
Review of the literature. Systemic autoimmune diseases
such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and rheumatoid
arthritis (RA) are considered rare in patients with T. cruzi infection,
but this may be due to the underdiagnosis of autoimmune diseases
in low-income areas/countries. The coexistence of Chagas disease
and these two conditions has been rarely reported in the scientific
literature, with only 12 cases of SLE [60–62] and one of RA
described to date [63].
Barousse et al. [60] reported on a series of ten patients with SLE
and T. cruzi infection treated with nifurtimox. Five of the patients
were receiving concomitant immunosuppressive therapy and three
of these died. Reactivation was not identified in these patients
(autopsy did not show T. cruzi amastigotes, so Chagas disease was
not identified as cause of death for any of them) or in the remaining
seven patients monitored during follow-up. Dos Santos-Neto et al.
[61] described a patient with mesangial proliferative lupus
glomerulonephritis and Chagas disease treated with prednisone
(1 mg/kg) and monthly pulses of cyclophosphamide (1 g/m2 of
body surface). They reported reactivation in the form of CNS
involvement and high parasitemia determined by xenodiagnosis,
and treated successfully with benznidazole. After 8 years of follow
up, the patient died of generalized lupus vasculitis. The twelfth case
of SLE in association with Chagas disease was described by our
group in 2010 [62]. In the only case of concomitant Chagas disease
and RA in the literature [63], the patient developed polymyositis 28
years after the diagnosis of RA. Benznidazole was not prescribed.
The detection of parasites in the muscle lesions suggested Chagas
disease etiology, and the worsening clinical condition and disease
progression could have been related to the use of corticosteroids.

Two studies have provided valuable information about the use of
corticosteroids at immunosuppressive doses in patients with T. cruzi
[64,65]. Rassi et al. [65] described the effectiveness of benznidazole
in reducing reactivation rates in patients with T. cruzi infection
treated with corticosteroids, but they also described higher rates of
parasitemia that appeared to be related to higher doses of
corticosteroids. Nevertheless, in all the cases, there were other
causes of immunosuppression besides the long-term use of
corticosteroids. There has just been one case reported of
reactivation of Chagas disease in which corticosteroids were the
only immunosuppressive factor: that of a child receiving dexameth￾asone for a cranial traumatism [66]. Currently, there is no firm
evidence of an association between immunosuppressive doses of
corticosteroids alone and higher rates of T. cruzi reactivation [64].
Our experience. Our experience with Chagas disease in
association with autoimmune diseases consists of three patients
with SLE and one with RA (Tables 4 and 5). All the patients
received benznidazole from the moment of diagnosis, and no
episodes of reactivation were observed during follow-up. In one
patient with SLE and chronic Chagas disease (the one coming
from Misiones, Argentina) who was diagnosed with lupus nephritis
requiring immunosuppressive treatment, response to benznidazole
was not achieved, but subsequent treatment with posaconazole led
to a successful resolution of the infection. In fact, despite
maintenance of immunosuppressive therapy due to renal involve￾ment, parasitemia became negative and no episodes of reactivation
were observed in a follow-up period of 36 months.
Recommendations for management. The most relevant
consequences of continuous immunosuppressive treatment in
patients with systemic autoimmune disease and Chagas disease is
the risk of reactivation of T. cruzi infection and the development of
severe, chronic forms of the disease. Unfortunately, guidelines for
the management of T. cruzi infection in this setting do not exist. In
immunosuppressed patients, trypanocidal treatment with benzni￾dazole or nifurtimox is indicated (BII recommendation) [51]. This
treatment should be initiated before immunosuppression where
possible to decrease the risk of reactivation. The use of
benznidazole in patients who require long-term corticosteroid
therapy is controversial due to the lack of supporting evidence.
Summary. Clinicians should bear in mind that the natural
course of T. cruzi infection can be modified by other diseases or
their treatment. Immunosuppressive doses of corticosteroids have
not been associated with higher rates of reactivation of Chagas
disease. Furthermore, there have been no reports of a relationship
between Chagas disease reactivation and other immunosuppres￾sive drugs used in the treatment of systemic autoimmune diseases,
and it has not been shown that these diseases have a direct role in
the progression of T. cruzi infection.
Final Considerations
The number of patients under immunosuppressive therapy is
increasing and timely management is important to reduce the risk
of comorbidities. The main goal in T. cruzi–infected patients with
an immunosuppressive condition is to prevent serious consequenc￾es of reactivation of T. cruzi infection by close monitoring, and in
the event of reactivation, to start early treatment with benznida￾zole and/or nifurtimox to minimize clinical complications.
Currently there is no international consensus on how to manage
the clinical situations described in this article, and it is difficult to
develop evidence-based recommendations due to the small
number of Chagas disease patients diagnosed with an immuno￾suppressive condition besides HIV. As in other clinical situations,
consensus guidelines based on expert opinion could greatly
contribute to standardizing the management of patients with T.
cruzi infection and a concomitant immunosuppressive condition.

Learning Points
N Early diagnosis of T. cruzi infection in immunosuppressed
individuals is extremely important, and should be
assessed prior to immunosuppressive treatment.
N In T. cruzi–infected patients with an immunosuppressive
condition, the main goal is to prevent reactivation by
close monitoring.
N Parasitemia measured by PCR techniques is recom￾mended in immunosuppressed patients during follow￾up.
N In cases of reactivation, early treatment with benznida￾zole and/or nifurtimox is strongly recommended, and
posaconazole should be indicated when this fails.
