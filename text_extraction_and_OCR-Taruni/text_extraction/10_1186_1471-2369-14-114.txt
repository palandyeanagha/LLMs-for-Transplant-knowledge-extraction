Abstract
Background: There is a rising incidence of chronic kidney disease that is likely to pose major problems for both
healthcare and the economy in future years. In India, it has been recently estimated that the age-adjusted
incidence rate of ESRD to be 229 per million population (pmp), and >100,000 new patients enter renal replacement
programs annually.
Methods: We cross-sectionally screened 6120 Indian subjects from 13 academic and private medical centers all
over India. We obtained personal and medical history data through a specifically designed questionnaire. Blood and
urine samples were collected.
Results: The total cohort included in this analysis is 5588 subjects. The mean ± SD age of all participants was
45.22 ± 15.2 years (range 18–98 years) and 55.1% of them were males and 44.9% were females. The overall prevalence
of CKD in the SEEK-India cohort was 17.2% with a mean eGFR of 84.27 ± 76.46 versus 116.94 ± 44.65 mL/min/1.73 m2
in non-CKD group while 79.5% in the CKD group had proteinuria. Prevalence of CKD stages 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 was 7%,
4.3%, 4.3%, 0.8% and 0.8%, respectively.
Conclusion: The prevalence of CKD was observed to be 17.2% with ~6% have CKD stage 3 or worse. CKD risk factors
were similar to those reported in earlier studies.
It should be stressed to all primary care physicians taking care of hypertensive and diabetic patients to screen for early
kidney damage. Early intervention may retard the progression of kidney disease. Planning for the preventive health
policies and allocation of more resources for the treatment of CKD/ESRD patients are imperative in India.

Background
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is emerging to be an im￾portant chronic disease globally [1]. One reason is the
rapidly increasing worldwide incidence of diabetes [2]
and hypertension [3,4]. In India, given its population >1
billion, the rising incidence of CKD is likely to pose
major problems for both healthcare and the economy in
future years. Indeed, it has been recently estimated that
the age-adjusted incidence rate of ESRD in India to be
229 per million population (pmp) [5], and >100,000 new
patients enter renal replacement programs annually in
India [6]. On the other hand, because of scarce re￾sources, only 10% of the Indian ESRD patients receive
any renal replacement therapy (RRT) [6-8]. The lack of
community-based screening programs has led to pa￾tients being detected with CKD at an advanced stage. It
is possible that early detection of kidney disease through
community based screening programs might have an im￾pact on this problem through earlier intervention. The
Screening and Early Evaluation of Kidney Disease Pro￾ject (SEEK) was designed and performed to generate
data to determine the prevalence and risk factors for
CKD in India.
Methods
Thirteen academic and private medical centers in India
participated in the study under the name of “Screening
and Early Evaluation of Kidney disease - SEEK.” Any
Indian male and female with age over 18 years are eli￾gible to participate in the screening. It was conducted
between June 2005 to May 2007, coordinated from the
Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, Massachu￾setts, a teaching affiliate of Harvard Medical School. The
protocol was approved by the Partner’s Institutional
Review Board (IRB) as well as by individual centers own
institutional IRBs. Signed or verbal informed consent
(confirmed by a witness) was obtained before adminis￾tering the questionnaire, taking measurements or blood
collection. The database is based at the Brigham and
Women’s Hospital.
Questionnaire
A structured questionnaire was developed and pre-tested
in the pilot study of 500 subjects carried out at one center
in South India (Additional file 1). The questionnaire was
translated into local languages (e.g., Telugu, Hindi,
Marathi, Kannada, Gujarati and Malayalam). The ques￾tionnaire was generally administered by non-medical
staff /volunteers who were trained by the SEEK-India
team in interviewing techniques. At every site, staff was
trained in interview techniques and measurement of
height, weight and blood pressure by organizing a half day
workshop prior to the camp. A team of nephrologists,
nurses, technicians and trained interviewers participated
in the camps. Questionnaires collected from the field were
reviewed by the local site principal investigator and data
entry was carried out locally.
Anthropometric measures
Body mass index (BMI) was calculated using the formula
“weight (Kg) / height (m2).” The waist to hip circumfer￾ence ratio (WHR) was calculated by using the waist cir￾cumference at the narrowest circumference between the
lower costal margin and the iliac crest. Hip circumfer￾ence was measured at the maximum circumference at
the level of the femoral trochanters.
Blood pressure measurement
In order to get a standardized blood pressure (BP) meas￾urement, a protocol per American Heart Association
guidelines [9] and a power-point presentation was pro￾vided to the centers, and staff training was carried out
prior to camps. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) was based
on the 1st Korotkoff phase and diastolic (DBP) on the
5th Korotkoff phase. Mercury sphygmomanometer was
used after checking for zero error. BP was recorded in
the sitting position in the right arm supported at heart
level, to the nearest 2 mm using mercury sphygmoman￾ometer. An average of two readings was taken into
consideration.
Blood and Urine sample collection
Random blood samples were collected. Blood was sent to a
central laboratory. Quality control for temperature
transporting specimens was checked and confirmed; i.e.,
4–9 degree Celsius. Serum creatinine was measured using
Jaffe Colorimetric method on a Roche Hitachi 912 analyzer.
The instrument was calibrated (external calibration) using
the Cleveland Clinic Foundation (CCF) creatinine panel.
Regression analysis was carried out to calculate a formula
to convert creatinine values obtained at the SRL-Ranbaxy
laboratory (SRL) to the CCF values as follows: CCF
creatinine = −0.13 + SRL creatinine * 0.99. Urine protein
was detected by dipstick method (Bayer Multistix 10 SG).
A modified MDRD-3 equation GFR(mL/min/1.73 m2) =
175 × (Scr)- 1.54 × (Age)- 0.203 × (0.742 if female) × (1.212 if
African American) was used [10]. Plasma glucose was
measured by the glucose oxidase peroxidase method using
Roche Hitachi 912 analyzer.
Variables definitions
Hypertension was defined as SBP/DBP > = 140 /90 mm
of Hg [11] or if the patient was on medication for hyper￾tension or had a positive self reported history of hyper￾tension (based on a response to “have you ever been
told that you have high blood pressure” or “a past his￾tory of high blood pressure”).
Singh et al. BMC Nephrology 2013, 14:114 Page 2 of 10
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2369/14/114

Diabetes was defined as fasting blood sugar FBS > = 126
or random blood sugar > = 200 or on any medications for
diabetes mellitus (ADA definition) [12], or if there was a
positive response to the questions “have you ever been
told that you have diabetes” or “past history of diabetes.”
Self reported history of medications was verified and if the
subject did not know the name of the medication and or if
the stated name was incorrect, the response was consid￾ered as “no” even if the subject’s response to the question
on “are you on BP or diabetes medications” was “yes.”
According to the International Diabetes Federation
(IDF) criteria, abdominal obesity was defined waist cir￾cumference of ≥94 cm in men and ≥80 cm in women [13].
CKD stages were defined using NKF-KDOQI guide￾lines (eGFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m2 or proteinuria > 1+ on
dipstick) [14]. Urine protein positivity (proteinuria) was
defined as urine albumin 1+ or more. We used the
CKD-EPI equation [15] in the sensitivity analysis to fur￾ther explore the burden of CKD using this equation.
Self reported ischemic heart disease was taken as
present if there was a self reported history of a myocar￾dial infarction, percutaneous angioplasty or coronary
artery bypass surgery (CABG).
All patients with CKD diagnosed in camps received the
reports along with a referral to the local hospitals/clinics.
Statistical analysis
IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, version 19, 2010,
SPSS Inc., an IBM company, was used. In the descriptive
analysis, continuous variables were expressed as mean ±
standard deviation (SD) and categorical variables were
expressed as count (percentages). While making no
assumption about the distribution of data, normality
distribution testing of the continuous variables was
performed using the non-parametric test; Kolmogorov￾Smirnov test (KS-test). Univariate analyses comparing
distributions of socio-demographic and clinical/historical
measures between CKD groups was performed using in￾dependent unpaired student t Test for normally distrib￾uted continuous variables and Mann–Whitney U Test
for non-normally distributed continuous variables. For
categorical variables we used Pearson chi-square test.
Fisher’s exact test was used when there was one or more
of cells with an expected frequency <5. We performed
spearman correlation analysis to study the relationship
between eGFR and other variables. The values of
Spearman’s rho and the p-value have been reported.
Results
Six thousand one hundred and twenty subjects were
screened as part of the SEEK-India project. We recruited
subjects through 53 screening camps in 12 cities across
India representing almost all Indian regions (Table 1).
We excluded subjects who were less than 18 years of
age (n = 28), with history of dialysis (n = 19) and with
history of kidney transplantation (n = 6) (Figure 1). We
further excluded subjects for which certain variables’ re￾sults were not recorded. These variables included gen￾der, age, history of dialysis or kidney transplantation,
serum creatinine and urine albumin. The total cohort in￾cluded in this analysis is 5588 subjects. The mean ± SD
age of all participants was 45.22 ± 15.2 years (range 18–
98 years) and 55.1% of them were males and 44.9% were
females. Hypertension was observed in 43.1% of our
population while 18.8% of them were diabetic. The
mean ± SD of BMI was 23.91 ± 5.3 kg/m2. Defining over￾weight and obesity as BMI between 25–30 and >30 kg/m2,
respectively, the prevalence of overweight and obesity
in our sample was 26.4% and 11.7%, respectively. How￾ever, 36.5% had abdominal obesity where the mean
waist circumference was 83.03 ± 14 cm. The mean esti￾mated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) using the
MDRD-3 and CKD-EPI equations were 111.31 ± 53 and
104.9 ± 25.52 mL/min/1.73 m2 respectively. The remaining
baseline demographics, clinical and laboratory data were
summarized in Tables 2 and 3.
Prevalence of CKD
Using MDRD equation, the overall prevalence of CKD
in the SEEK-India cohort was 17.2% with a mean eGFR

in non-CKD group while 79.5% in the CKD group had
proteinuria. Prevalence of CKD stages 1, 2, 3, 4 and
5 was 7%, 4.3%, 4.3%, 0.8% and 0.8%, respectively
(Figure 2).
CKD was higher in males across all stages of CKD
(Figure 3). Those subjects who had low eGFR (<60 ml/
min/1.73 m2) comprised 5.9% of the sample (N = 331)
while 13.7% had proteinuria (N = 766).
The prevalence of CKD was center-dependent (Figure 4).
The highest prevalence of CKD was observed in
Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh (46.8%), Kanpur, Uttar
Pradesh (41.7%) and Delhi (41%). The lowest prevalence
was observed in Mysore and Bangalore in Karnataka state
(4.2% and 4%, respectively).
CKD Risk factors
Patients with CKD were older, more likely to be male,
more likely to have a high school diploma, more likely to
be urban, less likely to have a low income, more likely to
be overweight or obese, to have diabetes, hypertension
and cardiovascular disease than patients without CKD.
The most common risk factors and other characteristics
among the subjects diagnosed with CKD were hyperten￾sion (64.5%), anemia (40.7%) and diabetes (31.6%)
(Figure 5). Anthropometric measures (except height),
blood pressure, hemoglobin, random and fasting blood
glucose correlated significantly with eGFR in the study
cohort. However, age, blood pressure and hemoglobin
correlated with eGFR in the CKD subgroup (Table 4).
Only 7.9% of the subjects with CKD were aware that
they have CKD, while 5.9% of those with proteinuria
reported knowing that they had protein in the urine.
Sensitivity analysis using the CKD-EPI equation
We used the CKD-EPI equation in a sensitivity analysis
to test whether it produced similar results to the
MDRD-3 equation (Tables 2 and 3). Using the CKD-EPI
equation, the prevalence of CKD was 16.4%. CKD Stage
1 was 8%, slightly higher than the one estimated using
MDRD-3. However, the prevalence of CKD stages 2 and
3 were 3.2% and 3.3%, respectively and slightly lower

than MDRD. The CKD-EPI equation performed similar
to MDRD-3 in CKD stages 4 and 5 (0.8% each). A com￾parison between the CKD and non-CKD subgroups (as
defined using the CKD-EPI equation) with respect to the
baseline demographics, clinical and laboratory variables,
did not yield different results.
Discussion
The main finding of this study using a convenience co￾hort design is that the prevalence of CKD in the SEEK￾India cohort is 17.2%. The prevalence of CKD stages 1,
2, 3, 4 and 5 was 7%, 4.3%, 4.3%, 0.8% and 0.8%, respect￾ively. Hypertension, anemia and diabetes were the most
common risk factors and associated characteristics asso￾ciated with CKD. Furthermore, old age, hypertension
(both SBP and DBP) and low hemoglobin level were cor￾related with decreased eGFR in the CKD subgroup.
A recent study on 3398 central government employees
in India reported ~13-15% prevalence of early stages of
CKD (Stages 1, 2 and 3), similar in magnitude to our
results, although they used microproteinuria, hematuria
and/or leukocyturia as indicators of kidney damage. A
study from Apollo Hospital in Chennai [16] reported a
prevalence of impaired renal function (eGFR less than
80 mL/min.m2) as 0.86% to 1.39%. This was done
through the Rural Program of The Kidney Help Trust of
Chennai. The investigators applied a regular screening
program of an entire population of 25,000 while treating
patients for diabetes and hypertension. Although the
Chennai study was a population-based design, it was re￾stricted only residents of a group of villages and hamlets
about 50 km away from Chennai [17]. This makes
generalization to the entire Indian population difficult.
Furthermore, they did not include in their definition of
CKD those subjects with proteinuria. In our SEEK-India
cohort, 79.5% of those subjects diagnosed with CKD
had proteinuria.
Agrawal et al. [18] performed a community-based
study to determine the prevalence of CKD in the South
Zones of Delhi. They used the multi-stage cluster

sampling method in recruiting their subjects. They de￾fined “renal failure” as a serum creatinine >1.8 mg/dL
and reported a prevalence of CKD of 0.79%. However,
those subjects with positive proteinuria (by dipstick test)
constituted 4.4% of their population and were not in￾cluded in their definition of CKD.
The SEEK-India study is similar in design to the KEEP
study conducted by the National Kidney Foundation in
the USA [19]. It is a convenience cohort, which invokes
both strengths and limitations. In a convenience cohort
non-random selection of patients may lead to biases that
result in screening of “high risk” individuals thereby in￾flating the prevalence estimates. On the other hand, our
prevalence of 17.2% of CKD is lower to that observed in
the NHANES study [20] and is lower than that in the
KEEP study [21]. Reports from other Asian countries
have shown a high prevalence of CKD. Jafar et al. ob￾served a CKD prevalence of 9% in men and 11% women
aged 40 years or over (using NKF criteria) [22].
Reports from other countries participating in the
Global SEEK project have been published. The results of

showed 17.5% prevalence of CKD [23]. The SEEK-Saudi
Arabia showed a prevalence of 5.7% [24]. Another report
from Thailand has shown an increasing prevalence
of decreased kidney function using the criterion of
GFR <60 ml/min, 1.7% in 1985 to 6.8% in 1997 of the
3499 employees of Electric Generation Authority screened
[25]. The prevalence of proteinuria was also increased
from 2.64% and 6.10% in the same period. Chen et al. have
reported a decreased renal function (GFR < 60 ml/min by
the MDRD equation) as 2.53% of 15,540 Chinese adults
(35 to 74 years) [26]. The investigators noted that their
study has a limitation in that urinary protein was not mea￾sured and persons with albuminuria or microalbuminuria
were not included in the estimated prevalence of CKD.
Therefore, their findings certainly underestimate the
prevalence of CKD in the Chinese adult population. In the
present study the prevalence of reduced GFR was 5.9% of
the screened population. The prevalence of earlier stages
of CKD primarily indicated by proteinuria was higher and
constituted 13.7%. Results from SEEK-Egypt will be pub￾lished soon.
Increased prevalence of CKD could be partly explained
by the high prevalence of risk factors like diabetes
and hypertension in the screened population (18.8% and
431.1%, respectively). The prevalence of diabetes and hyper￾tension in India varied widely in many studies and ranged
from 6-20% and 13-58%, respectively [27,28]. Among the
CKD group, 64.5% had hypertension and 31.6% had
diabetes mellitus. Self reported kidney stones disease was
observed in 4.5%.
Despite the high prevalence that we reported in our
study, subjects in our cohort had a low awareness of

CKD. Only 7.9% of subjects knew that they had CKD
compared to 1.9% in SEEK-Thailand and 7.1% in SEEK￾Saudi Arabia. This might reflect the lack of healthcare re￾sources available to the population. When performing
sensitivity analysis using CKD-EPI equation, the preva￾lence of CKD in our study was 16.4% (versus 17.2% using
MDRD-3 equation). A recently published study aimed at
evaluating the applicability of CKD-EPI equation to eGFR
in Chinese patients of different stages of CKD [29], com￾pared it with body surface area-standardized GFR (sGFR),
which was measured by diethylenetriaminepentaacetic
acid renal dynamic imaging method in 142 CKD cases.
eGFR was positively correlated with sGFR and the average
deviation of eGFR from sGFR was −0.92 ± 16.36 mL/min/
1.73 m2 (p = 0.506). They also observed no significant de￾viation in the CKD from stages 2 to 5. However, in CKD
stage 1, the deviation was increased with the value of
13.36 ± 18.44 mL/min/1.73 m [2] (p = 0.023).
In our SEEK-India cohort, the prevalence of CKD was
16.4%. CKD Stage 1 was 8%, slightly higher than the one
estimated using MDRD-3 (7%). However, prevalence of
CKD stages 2 and 3 were 3.2% and 3.3% respectively,
slightly lower than MDRD-3 (4.3% and 4.3% respectively).
It also showed similar results to MDRD-3 in CKD stages 4
and 5 (0.8% each). Similar comparisons are supported by
other studies in UK [30] where it was shown to be more
accurate than the MDRD formula at higher GFR and also
reduced the estimated prevalence of CKD stages 3–5
by ~0.5%-0.7%. Further analysis of KEEP study showed
similar results [31,32] and the KEEP investigators stated
that CKD-EPI will be used to report eGFR in KEEP.
Sixty three percent of our total sample, and almost half
of the CKD group (52.6%), earns < $125 a month. Pov￾erty and lack of education often go together. Among the
CKD population, 37.6% had less than high school which
may have contributed to this lack of awareness. In the
NHANES study 11.6% of men and 5.5% of women in
CKD stage-3 knew about their disease [20].
Our study had several potential limitations. We used a
convenience study design rather than a cluster ran￾domization design and/or household surveys. We mir￾rored our design on that used by the NKF KEEP cohort
in order to bench mark our community based cohort
with the results of KEEP. However our sampling strategy
may not be ideal for evaluation of true prevalence. An￾other limitation was the single measurement of serum
creatinine and urine albumin. Repeated measures might

improve the precision around our reporting of the data.
Furthermore, a subsequent measurement after 3 months
might have provided additional insights into the chron￾icity of the disease. Additionally, the prevalence of CKD
might have been overestimated by using the Bayer’s
multistix 10 which detects urine protein, not albu￾minuria. Another limitation is that we used the MDRD
equation using the race factor for compatible for Ameri￾cans. However, there are concerns of the application of
the definition and staging system for current eGFR esti￾mating equations to the Indian population. Different diet
and muscle mass in the Indian as compared to the
North American populations may lead to both diffe￾rences in the normal level for kidney function in the
population as well as the relationship between creatinine
and GFR as reflected in the estimating equations; where
these equations have been predominantly developed
and validated.
Conclusion
In conclusion, in this large, community-based cross￾sectional study using a convenience sample of SEEK, we
successfully carried out CKD screening using simple
tests to estimate e-GFR and protienuria. The prevalence
of CKD was observed to be 17.2% with ~6% have CKD
stage 3 or worse. CKD risk factors were similar to those
reported in earlier studies. Awareness was observed to
be low. This data supports the importance of improving
the education and early detection of CKD. It should be
stressed to all primary care physicians taking care of
hypertensive and diabetic patients to screen for early
kidney damage. Early intervention may retard the pro￾gression of kidney disease. Planning for the preventive
health policies and allocation of more resources for the
treatment of CKD/ESRD patients are imperative in India.
