Over the past ten years, high-income
countries in the North have provided
considerable financial aid to establish and
support national blood transfusion services
in low-income countries in sub-Saharan
Africa. This action has largely been driven
by concerns relating to the contribution of
blood transfusion to the HIV epidemic in
the region, leading to the overwhelming
objective of ‘‘safe blood.’’ Whilst there
have been definite benefits to transfusion
services, we believe this aid has resulted in
unintended but serious negative outcomes,
which we describe here and argue should
prompt a re-thinking of how to provide
support to blood transfusion services in
sub-Saharan Africa.
Support has targeted either single coun￾tries such as Malawi, Rwanda, Burkina
Faso, and Uganda [1,2] or multiple
countries [3]. Funds, available only for
limited periods, have been used to support
a combination of infrastructure design and
construction; purchase of equipment;
screening for transfusion-transmitted in￾fections and quality assurance; and the
recruitment of blood donors. As a direct
consequence of this funding, some of the
underlying principles of transfusion servic￾es practised in the high-income donor
countries have been applied in sub￾Saharan Africa recipient countries (Box
1). These principles may be based on
sound practice in wealthy countries but do
not necessarily apply to sub-Saharan
Africa at this time. We argue that
considering the needs of sub-Saharan
Africa, external aid was to some extent
misdirected in the areas of donor recruit￾ment, overall organisation, and availability
of products.
Current Transfusion Practice in
Sub-Saharan Africa
It is important to recognise the partic￾ular circumstances and specific needs of
recipient countries, which differ consider￾ably for historical and economic reasons.
Whereas blood product use in wealthy
countries is largely pre-planned and pre￾dictable, the vast majority of blood
product use in sub-Saharan Africa is for
emergencies, therefore truly saving lives
when delivered quickly [4]. Depending on
the country, 50% to 80% of transfusions
are related to just a few clinical circum￾stances: severe haemorrhage in women
related to pregnancy and childbirth;
trauma usually as a consequence of road
traffic crashes; and severe anaemia in
young children, often due to malaria.
Timely access to blood transfusion has a
clear role to play in achieving two of the
Millennium Development Goals—reduc￾ing death rates by two-thirds in children
under-five and by three-quarters in moth￾ers. For severe malarial anaemia the
product of choice, which has been shown
to save lives and is recommended by the
World Health Organization (WHO), is
whole blood [5–8].
Before national blood transfusion ser￾vices were established, blood provision in
sub-Saharan Africa was totally decentra￾lised, with blood banks operating in
individual hospitals and often collecting
1,000 to 10,000 units a year. These blood
banks were, and still are, an integral part
of the hospitals they serve and are located
close to patients, clinicians, and hospital
The Essay section contains opinion pieces on topics
of broad interest to a general medical audience.

managers [9]. Blood donors are often
family or replacement donors, who are
recruited from the relatives or friends of
patients [10]. Replacement donors are
described as such because for each unit
of blood that is transfused, the onus is on
the wider family circle to replace it in
order to maintain supply [10,11]. Paid
donors may be called upon when family or
friends are unable to meet this responsi￾bility. Collecting blood from paid donors is
banned in most countries in sub-Saharan
Africa because they are notoriously unsafe
but, in some settings without access to
computerised donor registries, distinguish￾ing them from family donors is often
challenging [12].
Transfusion services in sub-Saharan
Africa have been organised in this way
because of culture, climate, communica￾tions, and, most importantly, because
resources are limited. This fragmentation
makes coordination of blood services and
implementation of good laboratory prac￾tices and their quality assurance difficult,
and imposes an additional burden on
families in already stressful circumstanc￾es. Patients often present to hospital late
in the course of their disease process [6–
8]. Because life is at risk, the family
traditionally congregates to support the
patient and supplies blood when it is
asked for.
If transfusion costs are not met by
governments or health insurance funding,
the cost of a unit of blood can often be
prohibitive for families [13]. If transfusion
costs are covered by governments or
insurance, the cost can substantially affect
the limited budgets of hospitals (for blood
banks) or government (for blood centres)
[10]. To produce a unit of whole blood
from a family donor costs two to four
times less than a unit from a voluntary
non-remunerated, blood donor (VNRD)
[10]. Maintaining centralised blood cen￾tres and managing the quality assurance
and donor recruitment processes is ex￾pensive, so it is not surprising that, when
external support is discontinued, the cost
of blood products far exceeds the locally
available budget.
The three principles outlined in Box 1,
when imposed without careful consider￾ation of local conditions, can undermine
efforts to improve the supply of safe blood.
Although the conditions of external finan￾cial assistance are discussed at the govern￾ment level, practitioners on the ground are
rarely consulted [14–17].
Centralisation
Evidence indicates that for both severe
haemorrhage and malaria-related severe
anaemia, mortality increases significantly
if transfusion is delayed more than 1 hour
[4,18]. Rapid availability of blood is
therefore critical. However, low and
unpredictable blood demand in small
hospital blood banks means that they
cannot justify keeping a fully tested
bloodstock from family-replacement do￾nors. It is also difficult for small blood
banks to establish and maintain high￾quality procedures when fewer than ten
units/day are collected and there is high
staff turnover [14]. Conversely, reliance
on a distant centralised source for blood in
settings where communications are unre￾liable, fuel shortages are common, and
roads may be impassable, will inevitably
result in delays and stock-outs.
Sole Reliance on Volunteer
Non-remunerated Donors
When applied dogmatically, the
VNRD-only policy can prolong or worsen
the chronic blood shortages experienced
in blood systems that previously relied on
family-replacement donors [7]. Neither
VNRD nor family-replacement donors
alone have been able to provide an
adequate blood supply [19,20], and
diversity in donor sources is desirable
[21]. Security of supply is difficult to
achieve exclusively with VNRD who, in
most countries, are predominantly sec￾ondary school students unavailable during
school recesses and exam periods. Thus,
the blood supply for as much as 3 months
of the year is restricted. In contrast,
family-replacement donors are available
year round. The majority of blood donors
in sub-Saharan Africa are first-time do￾nors. Studies of HIV and hepatitis B virus
prevalence in first-time donors have
shown a similar risk profile in VNRD
and family-replacement donors [11,22–
26]. Regular donors, irrespective of type,
are substantially safer than first-time
donors [11]. The higher costs of blood
donated by VNRD compared with fam￾ily-replacement donors [9,11] result from
the infrastructure necessary to recruit and
retain them [20].
Blood Component Preparation
We recognise that the component
model in the developed world has some
justification from the perspectives of both
quality and safety. However, in sub￾Saharan Africa a policy of systematic
component preparation from all donations
can result in serious negative consequences
(Box 2). Figure 1 illustrates the situation of
individual blood centres in five countries
that receive no external support for their
Summary Points
N Development aid to sub-Saharan African blood services has brought benefits
but also some unintended negative consequences.
N Policies and practices from funding countries, particularly exclusive use of
volunteer non-remunerated donors, centralisation, and systematic preparation
of blood components are not necessarily appropriate for sub-Saharan Africa
where the vast majority of transfusions are done as emergencies.
N Implementation of these policies and practices adds significantly to the cost of
a unit of blood, making the transfusion services unaffordable in resource poor
settings and creating long term reliance on external funding.
N We argue that externally funded initiatives for strengthening transfusion
services in sub-Saharan Africa should be based on appropriate evidence and
adapted to take account of the local context, available resources, and long term
sustainability.
Box 1. The Principles Underlying External Financial Support for
Blood Transfusion Services in Sub-Saharan Africa
N Centralisation of operations in relatively large blood centres, which are stand
alone institutions independent physically and functionally from hospitals able
to collect, process, and distribute .10,000 blood donations a year. Automation
becomes feasible and quality assurance programmes are more practicable.
N The exclusive recruitment of VNRD, which has been practiced for over 30 years
in developed countries; this is based on the assumption that other types of
donor are less safe owing to higher prevalence of HIV-1 infections.
N The preparation of blood components with the assumption that this is a more
effective use of whole blood donations.

blood services (left) and four countries that
are supported by wealthy countries (right).
The nationally funded blood services
prepare and transfuse almost exclusively
whole blood whereas the externally sup￾ported group, with the exception of one
centre in Coˆte d’Ivoire, prepares almost
exclusively red cell concentrates [27].
Only one study has presented the clinical
side effects of transfusion in sub-Saharan
Africa but did not compare whole blood
with blood components [28].
Summary and Proposals
Undoubtedly, donor countries would be
concerned if the indiscriminate transposi￾tion to sub-Saharan Africa of principles
underpinning transfusion services in high￾income countries resulted in the undesir￾able outcomes described above. Clearly,
such negative consequences are not the
intention of these programmes, which
have built and equipped large blood
centres, trained a generation of transfusion
specialists, and have had some success in
developing VNRD programmes. Howev￾er, acknowledging that these outcomes are
possible and that patients’ lives may be
endangered warrants careful reflection
and a search for alternatives. Allowing an
unnecessary increase in the cost of blood
relative to the rest of health care costs, in
the context of an average health care
budget at US$10–US$30/person/year,
can undermine the fundamentals of effec￾tive blood services. In our view, reflection
and systematic analysis is required to
assess three key questions (Box 3).
In the medium and long term, improv￾ing the evidence base to answer these three
key questions must be a priority. There are
already programmes estimating the cost￾effectiveness of blood safety interventions
[29], and a working party of the Interna￾Figure 1. Proportion of blood and blood components prepared in nine sub-Saharan African countries. The first five countries (Congo to

Box 2. Negative Outcomes of Blood Component Preparation in
Sub-Saharan Africa
N For the majority of patients in need of emergency transfusion, whole blood is
more quickly available and it may be the product of choice (see above) but is
actually unavailable.
N Using components instead of whole blood for emergency blood loss increases
the cost of the transfusion for families or health insurance systems two- to
three-fold, without clinical justification.
N The FFP removed to prepare red cell concentrates is little used clinically.
Stringent regulations concerning the qualification of plasma for fractionation
into intra-venous immunoglobulins, albumin, or clotting factors mean that
large volumes of FFP are discarded and wasted.

tional Society of Blood Transfusion is
dedicated to assessing different approaches
to blood transfusion in developing coun￾tries [30]. On the basis of current
evidence, it is suggested that leading
funding organisations should focus on
achieving adequate blood supply in order
to save lives in the context of emergency
blood transfusion in sub-Saharan Africa.
Developing Centralised and Devolved
Transfusion Services in Parallel
Centralised services bring opportunities
for economies of scale and sophisticated
quality assurance processes whereas hos￾pital-based services can rapidly respond to
local need and engage local communities.
The absolutely critical objective of ensur￾ing that there is enough blood available
quickly wherever it is needed can be
accomplished by simultaneously nurturing
centralised and hospital-based transfusion
services instead of investing exclusively in
one or the other model [9]. For hospital￾based blood banks, innovative testing and
quality assurance practices adapted to low
workload settings would be needed within
a coordinated national blood programme.
Quality assurance systems could be ad￾ministered with the assistance and respon￾sibility of the larger blood services. Tech￾nologies other than high throughput,
automated, and expensive equipment with
dedicated reagents would be complemen￾tary with high performance rapid tests or
point-of-care technologies for example
[31]. Combined systems would better
serve patients’ needs in most sub-Saharan
Africa countries [14].
Recruitment of Voluntary and
Family-Replacement Donors
We suggest that sole reliance on blood
donations from either VNRD or family￾replacement donors cannot at present
provide a sufficient blood supply in sub￾Saharan Africa. Both types of blood donor
should be welcomed as their prevalence of
viral markers and background safety is
similar. Both VNRD and family-replace￾ment donors should be encouraged to
become repeat donors. Paid donors should
continue to be discouraged. In some
countries family-replacement donors,
who are neither remunerated nor coerced,
are not differentiated from VNRD [32]. It
is therefore proposed that all types of
volunteer donors are drawn upon. While
the influx of family-replacement donors
can quickly reach a plateau, a volunteer
donor pool is more readily expandable.
Continuous recruitment efforts and inno￾vative strategies to encourage repeat
donation of all donors are urgently needed
[33].
Consideration of Whole Blood for
Transfusion
The use of whole blood, particularly
fresh (less than 1 week old) has been
recommended not only for malaria in sub￾Saharan Africa [4] but also suggested to be
of equal or potentially superior clinical
value for severe haemorrhage and trauma,
accompanied by other medications such as
tranexamic acid and appropriate surgery
[34–36]. The preparation of components
should be dictated by clinical require￾ments, limiting the unnecessary wastage of
fresh frozen plasma (FFP). Elsewhere, the
policy of separation of all donated blood
into components is driven by the need for
plasma for fractionation. This policy
should not be imposed on countries in
sub-Saharan Africa because it is inappro￾priate where the primary need for blood is
for emergency transfusion and excess
plasma cannot be used. The only plasma
fractionation plant in Africa is located in
South Africa and one way of reducing
plasma wastage would be to set up a
system that would enable it to process
plasma from across Africa to produce
primarily immunoglobulins but also factor
VIII to treat patients with haemophilia A.
In addition to improving patient care,
the changes we propose should contribute
to limiting the costs of transfusion, making
it more affordable and reducing the need
for dependency on external funding.
Efforts should be made to make tests and
equipment adapted to conditions in sub￾Saharan Africa [37]. While the clinical
demand may well change more quickly
than the economic situation, the strategy
needs sufficient flexibility to accommodate
developments in health care. Flexibility
and pragmatism are necessary to reduce
the unacceptably high rates of unnecessary
deaths in Africa because blood for trans￾fusion is lacking.
