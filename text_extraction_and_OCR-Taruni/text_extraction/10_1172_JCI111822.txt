Abstract
We investigated the role of thromboxane in mediating the
reduction in renal function and renal blood flow characteristic
of acute renal allograft rejection. We transplanted kidneys
from Lewis rats to Brown-Norway recipients. By the third day
after transplantation, histologic changes that were consistent
with cellular rejection occurred in the kidney. These changes
were associated with a moderate reduction in renal function.
By day 6, histologic changes of rejection were advanced and
included interstitial and perivascular infiltration by mononuclear
cells. The clearances of inulin and para-aminohippuric acid
were also markedly reduced.
As renal function deteriorated, thromboxane B2 (TXB2)
production by ex vivo perfused renal allografts increased
progressively from 2 to 6 d after transplantation. However,
prostaglandin (PG) E2 and 6-keto PGFI. production remained
essentially unchanged. There was a significant inverse corre￾lation between the in vivo clearance of inulin and the log of ex
vivo TXB2 production. Infusion of the thromboxane synthetase
inhibitor UK-37248-01 into the renal artery of 3-d allografts
significantly decreased urinary TXB2 excretion and significantly
increased renal blood flow (RBF) and glomerular filtration rate
(GFR). Although renal function improved significantly after
the acute administration of UK-37248-O1, GFR and RBF did
not exceed 33 and 58% of native control values, respectively.
In other animals, daily treatment with cyclophosphamide im￾proved the clearances of inulin and para-aminohippuric acid
and reduced thromboxane production by 6-d renal allografts.
These studies demonstrate that histologic evidence of rejection
is associated with increased renal thromboxane production.
Inhibition of thromboxane synthetase improves renal function
in 3-d allografts. Cytotoxic therapy improves renal function,
reduces mononuclear cell infiltration, and decreases allograft
thromboxane production. Thus, the potent vasoconstrictor
thromboxane A2 may play a role in the impairment of renal
function and renal blood flow during acute allograft rejection.
Introduction
The process of cellular rejection markedly reduces renal blood
flow (RBF)' and impairs excretory function in renal allografts.

Several investigators have described a reduction in renal cortical
blood flow during rejection that is greater than expected based
on the degree of morphologic changes in the kidney (1-4).
Hollenberg et al. (3) suggested that infiltrating cells may
produce local vasoconstrictors that could impair renal function.
Because leukocytes and various renal cells produce locally
vasoactive eicosanoids, alterations in prostaglandin (PG) and
thromboxane (TX) metabolism may play an important role in
renal allograft rejection. For example, Foegh et al. (5, 6)
reported that urinary immunoreactive thromboxane B2 (TXB2)
increases during episodes of acute rejection in human renal
allograft recipients. However, the source of the TXB2 that is
excreted in urine and the physiologic significance of increased
urinary TX is currently unknown (7-9).
Our objectives in this study were to evaluate the relationship
between renal function in vivo and TXB2 production in vitro,
and to examine whether histologic evidence of acute cellular
rejection correlated with increased TX production. To accom￾plish these objectives, we developed a model of acute renal
allograft rejection characterized by a predictable temporal
progression. Using a combination of ex vivo renal perfusion
studies, histopathologic evidence, and in vivo clearance and
hemodynamic studies with both a cytolytic agent and a TX
synthetase inhibitor, we have characterized changes in renal
function and renal eicosanoid production in this experimental
model of acute renal allograft rejection.
Methods
Rat renal transplants. Renal allografts from male Lewis rats weighing
200-300 g were transplanted into female Brown-Norway rats weighing
150-190 g using the technique described by Fabre et al. (10). The left
donor kidney of Lewis rats was prepared by freeing the ureter and
bladder from all peritoneal attachments. Renal artery and aorta were
separated from renal vein and inferior vena cava by blunt dissection.
Small arteries not involved in renal circulation were ligated and cut.
We infused heparin (1,000 U/kg, Upjohn Co., Kalamazoo, MI) intra￾venously and then clamped the donor aorta above the left renal artery.
The donor kidney was flushed with 20 ml of an iced solution
containing 10% mannitol, chloramphenicol (sodium succinate salt;
Merrel-National Laboratories, Cincinnati, OH) and 100 U of heparin
in half-normal saline. The kidney, ureter, and bladder were removed
en bloc, including the renal artery with a 3-mm aortic cuff, and the
renal vein with a 3-mm vena caval cuff. The kidney was placed into
an iced solution of 10% mannitol in saline.
We prepared the recipients by carefully separating aorta and vena
cava between the origin of the renal vessels and the bifurcation of the
iliacs. An anastomosis was created between the recipient's aorta and
the donor's aortic cuff; the recipient's vena cava was anastomosed to
the donor vena caval cuff. Total ischemic time averaged 40 min.

Donor and recipient bladders were attached dome to dome. The
recipients' native kidneys were left in situ. Surgical mortality of the
recipients was <10%.
Clearance studies. We measured clearances of inulin (C1.) and p￾aminohippuric acid (CPAH) on days I through 6 after transplantation
in 32 animals. Animals were anesthetized with inactin, and a polyeth￾elene catheter (PE-240) was inserted into the trachea to facilitate
spontaneous respiration. The right carotid artery was cannulated to
permit periodic sampling of arterial blood and to measure arterial
blood pressure (Gould-Statham strain gauge; Gould Inc., Hato Rey,
PR). The right jugular vein was cannulated to infuse carboxyl-'4C￾inulin and glycyl-[3H]PAH (New England Nuclear, Boston, MA) in a
solution of 5% mannitol and 0.45% saline at a rate of 0.025 ml 100
9- min-'. Allograft and right native kidney ureters were cannulated
to measure individual renal function. After a 1-h equilibration period,
C1. and CPAH were measured during two 30-min urine collections.
Arterial blood samples were obtained at the midpoint of each collection.
Ex vivo perfusion. After completing in vivo clearance studies, we
removed allografts for ex vivo perfusion to assess renal eicosanoid
production in 21 animals. In addition to these transplanted kidneys,
we perfused nontransplanted kidneys from normal Lewis rats ex vivo
(n = 4) and nontransplanted kidneys of Lewis rats subjected to 45
min of renal pedicle cross-clamping. Using a modification of previously
described methods (11), a polished metal perfusion catheter was
inserted into the left femoral artery and advanced to the transplant
anastomosis. The aorta was then ligated around the catheter. The renal
vein of the allograft was cannulated with a flared PE-90 catheter. The
kidney was removed and placed into a warming chamber (37°C).
We perfused kidneys with a cell-free Krebs-Henseleit buffered
solution to avoid prostanoid contamination from nonrenal cells. Per￾fusate was warmed to 32°C and oxygenated (95% 02, 5% C02) to
meet, more adequately, metabolic demands of the ex vivo perfused
kidney (12). In other studies, we have demonstrated that morphologic
evidence of cellular necrosis is absent with perfusate warmed to 32°C
and that there is extensive cortical necrosis when perfusate is delivered
at 37°C. At 32°C, oxygen consumption by tubule suspensions from
4-h perfused kidneys is normal and there is no increase in renal venous
lactate dehydrogenase activity during perfusion. Perfusate was delivered
at a rate sufficient to maintain pressure between 100 and 120 mmHg
(8 ml/min).
We collected two control samples of renal venous effluent during
the first 30 min of ex vivo perfusion. We then stimulated prostanoid
production by the kidney with l-,g boluses of bradykinin given every
30 min (11, 13). Samples of renal venous effluent were collected on
ice at 30-min intervals for a total of 4 h and 5-ml aliquots were stored
at -70°C. Samples were thawed, extracted, and then assayed for
TXB2, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), and 6-keto-PGF, by radioimmunoassay.
Cyclophosphamide treatment. In a second group of animals, we
evaluated the effects of immunosuppression on renal allograft function
and eicosanoid production. After transplantation, five rats were treated
with the alkylating agent cyclophosphamide 20 mg* kg-' day-' (Mead
Johnson, Evansville, IN). The first dose was injected intravenously
during transplantation, and subsequent daily doses were injected
intraperitoneally. We performed renal clearance and ex vivo perfusion
studies (as described above) in renal allografts after 6 d of cyclophos￾phamide therapy.
Effects of TX synthetase inhibition on renal hemodynamics. In a
group of seven animals, we evaluated the effects of increased TX
production on in vivo renal function in 3-d allografts. Renal clearance
studies were performed and RBF was measured in native and donor
kidneys before and after administering the TX synthetase inhibitor
(14) UK-37248-01 (4-(2-[IH-imidazol-l-Y']ethoxy)benzoic acid HCl,
Pfizer Inc., New York, NY. In these animals, a tapered PE-10 catheter
was inserted into the femoral artery and advanced into the allograft's
renal artery cuff (15). Normal saline or a solution of UK-37248-01 in
saline was infused into the renal artery at a constant rate of 24 Ad/
min. The renal vein of the allograft was catheterized with a curved
0.965 mm o.d. teflon catheter (Bradford Scientific, Marble Head, MA)
to collect samples for the determination of renal venous p-aminohippuric
acid (PAH) concentration. RBF was calculated as: CPAH/[EPAH
X (l-Hct)] (EPAH, PAH extraction; Hct, hematocrit).
After a 45-min equilibration period, we measured C1n, CPAH, and
EPAH in the allograft and right native kidneys during two 30-min
control periods. During control periods, normal saline was infused
into the renal artery of 3-d allografts. These values were remeasured
during two 30-min experimental periods while infusing the TX syn￾thetase inhibitor UK-37248-01 (100 jig kg-' - min-'). This dose was
selected after performing in vivo dose response curves in preliminary
renal function studies in 3-d allografts.
In a separate group of four animals with 3-d allografts, we docu￾mented that UK-37248-01 inhibited in vivo TXB2 production. In
these animals, the ureter of the transplanted kidney was cannulated
and urine was collected on ice before and after UK-37248-01 infusion
(100 Ag * kg- * min-'). Urine samples were extracted as described above
and TXB2 was measured by radioimmunoassay and expressed as
picograms of TXB2 produced per minute. In other studies using UK￾37248-01 in hydronephrotic rats, we have found that l00 Ago kg-' * min-'
administered into the renal artery inhibits renal TXB2 production ex
vivo, reduces urinary TXB2 excretion in vivo, and improves C1n and
RBF in vivo after 24 h of unilateral ureteral obstruction.
Histologic studies. After renal clearance or ex vivo perfusion
studies, all kidneys were fixed in buffered formalin for histologic
evaluation. 3-Mm sections were prepared and stained with hematoxylin
and eosin. Both native and donor kidneys were examined for the
presence of cellular infiltrates on days 1 through 6 after transplantation.
Analytical techniques. Tritium and `C radioactivity were measured
in plasma and urine with a dual channel liquid scintillation system
(Iso-Cap 300; Nuclear Chicago-TM Analytic Inc., Elk Grove Village,
IL). Plasma and urine Na' and K+ were analyzed with a lithium
internal standard flame photometer (Instrumentation Laboratory, Inc.,
Lexington, MA), and UO,, and Po,. with a vapor pressure osmometer
(Wescor Inc., Logan, UT).
Radioimmunoassays (RIAs). Prostanoids were extracted by passing
samples of renal venous effluent through C,8 columns (Sep-Pak C,8
cartridges; Waters Associates, Millford, MA). Cartridges were then
washed with distilled water, and samples were eluted with acetonitrile
and dried at 350C with dry nitrogen. Dried samples were resuspended
in buffer and assayed for TXB2, PGE2, or 6-keto PGF,,, by RIA. Small
amounts of tritiated compound were added to each sample before
extraction and RIA to correct for recovery. Using this extraction
procedure, 60-70% of [3H]TXB2, 70-80% of [3Hj6-keto-PGF,,,, and
70-80% of [3H]PGE2 were recovered. All RIA reagents were purchased
from Seragen Inc., Boston, MA. Specific antisera were generated in
rabbits using immunogen complexed to bovine serum albumin. Anti￾body to TXB2 demonstrated 50% binding at a final titer of 1:35,000;
cross-reactivity to 2-3 dinor TXB2 was 60%, and to other prostanoids
was <0.1%. Sensitivity of the antibody (50% displacement of radioligand)
was 12 pg. Antibody to PGE2 demonstrated 50% binding at a final
titer of 1:14,000; cross-reactivity was 6% for PGA2, 3% for PGA,,
1.3% for PGF2., and <1% to other prostanoids. Sensitivity of the
PGE2 antibody was 73 pg. Antibody to 6-keto-PGFI demonstrated
50% binding at a final assay titer of 1:45,000; cross-reactivity was 7.8%
for PGFI., 6.8% for 6-keto-PGE,, 2.2% for PGF2,,, 0.7% for PGE,,
0.6% to PGE2, and <0.01% for the other prostanoids. Sensitivity of
the 6-keto PGF,,, antibody was 47 pg.
Samples and standards were incubated with a mixture of antisera
and a known amount of tritiated standard at 40C for 20 h. Specific
activity of the 3H standards ranged between 110 and 165 Ci/mM.
After incubation, we adsorbed free prostanoid with dextran-coated
charcoal and measured 3H remaining in the supernatant with a liquid
scintillation counter. The unknowns, corrected for 3H recovery from
the extraction procedure, were compared with the standard curve in
which the logarithm of the concentration was plotted against the logit
of the B/Bo value. The results are expressed as picograms per minute
of prostanoid.

significance was assessed between groups with an unpaired t test, and
within groups with a paired t test. The correlation between the log of
TXB2 produced ex vivo and CIn measured in vivo was determined by
linear regression analysis.
Results
The clearances of inulin and PAH by native kidneys and
allografts on days 1 through 6 after transplantation are depicted
in Fig. 1. Native kidney C1n and CPAH remained unchanged
throughout most of the 6 d after transplantation with the
exception of day 2. On day 2, both CIn and CPAH increased
slightly but not significantly above basal values. On the first
day after transplantation, C1n and CPAH of renal allografts were
significantly reduced compared with native kidneys. On the
second day after transplantation, function of the allografts
improved and CPAH was not different from that of the na￾tive kidneys (7.82±1.82 ml min-' -kg-' vs. 9.69±1.45
ml * min-' - kg-'). Allograft C1n also improved but was still less
than that of native kidneys (2.35±0.45 ml.min-'-kg-' vs.
4.20±0.48 ml * min-' kg-'; P < 0.025). Allograft function de￾clined progressively from days 3 through 6; native kidney
function remained unchanged. On day 3, allograft C1n was
significantly reduced when compared with day 2 (0.9±0.3 vs.
2,35±0.45 ml * min-' * kg-', P < 0.025). CPAH was also signifi￾cantly reduced from 7.82±1.26 ml min-' - kg' on day 2 to
2.91±0.88 ml min-'-kg-' on day 3 (P < 0.025). By day 6,
Cin and CPAH of donor kidneys decreased to 0.04±0.04 and
0.24±0.21 ml min-' -kg-', respectively (P < 0.005 vs. day 3
values).
Histologic examination of allografts on the first day after
transplantation demonstrated patchy acute tubular necrosis
with no evidence of acute cellular rejection. There were focal
areas of brush border loss, sloughed epithelial cells, and
occasional intraluminal casts. On day 2, tubules and glomeruli
appeared histologically normal and there was only minimal
cellular infiltration. However, on the third day after transplan￾tation, there was marked infiltration of the interstitium by
inflammatory cells, especially in perivascular areas, with sparing
of glomeruli. 6 d after transplantation, there was marked
progression of mononuclear cell infiltration throughout the
interstitium of the allograft as well as glomerular capillary
involvement.

To evaluate the rejecting allograft's capacity for eicosanoid
production without contamination by other tissues, we perfused
allografts ex vivo with a cell-free perfusate and measured renal
venous 6-keto-PGFI,,, PGE2, and TXB2. Fig. 2 depicts renal
TXB2 production by ex vivo perfused kidneys 2, 3, and 6 d
after transplantation and by nontransplanted kidneys from
normal Lewis rats. Unstimulated TXB2 production by Lewis
control kidneys and 2-d allografts did not differ (28±8 pg/min
vs. 10±8 pg/min; n = 8). 3-d allografts produced significantly
greater amounts of TXB2 than 2-d allografts or normal Lewis
control kidneys. TXB2 production by 6-d transplanted kidneys
was significantly greater than the values of all other groups.
Bradykinin stimulation produced a significant and immediate
increase in TXB2 production by all transplanted kidneys, but
not by Lewis control kidneys. Unstimulated TXB2 production
by cross-clamped control kidneys and by 1-d allografts was
<40 pg/min. In these kidneys, acute tubular necrosis was the
predominant morphologic feature and there was no response
to bradykinin stimulation.
Fig. 3 illustrates the relationship between CM, and unstim￾ulated TXB2 production in 3- to 6-d allografts. C1n was
determined in vivo and the same kidneys were then removed
and perfused ex vivo to determine unstimulated and bradykinin￾stimulated TXB2 production. There was a significant inverse
linear correlation between the log of ex vivo TXB2 production
and in vivo inulin clearance (r = 0.74, P < 0.05).

6-d cyclophosphamide-treated allografts produced significantly
less TXB2 than untreated 6-d allografts both before and after
bradykinin stimulation. Furthermore, cyclophosphamide treat￾ment significantly reduced the interstitial infiltration of inflam￾matory cells in 6-d allografts.
Fig. 6 depicts 6-keto PGF1,0 production by three groups of
kidneys: (a) nontransplanted Lewis control kidneys; (b) allografts
2, 3, and 6 d after transplantation; and (c) 6-d cyclophospha￾mide-treated allografts. Ex vivo 6-keto PGF100 production
before bradykinin stimulation was similar in each group.
However, after 180 and 240 min of bradykinin stimulation,
6-keto PGF1,0 production by 2-, 3-, and 6-d allografts was
greater than the values of either Lewis controls or the cyclo￾phosphamide-treated rats.
As demonstrated in Fig. 7, there was no clear relationship
between the number of days after transplantation and ex vivo
PGE2 production. Unstimulated PGE2 production by 2-d
allografts was significantly less than values of nontransplanted
Lewis control kidneys (178±27 pg/min vs. 324±63 pg/min, P
< 0.05) and 3-d allografts (402±118 pg/min, P < 0.05). After
240 min of bradykinin stimulation, PGE2 production by both
Lewis control kidneys (1,915±283 pg/min, P < 0.005) and 2-
d allografts (1,813±456 pg/min, P < 0.025) was significantly
greater than that of cyclophosphamide-treated rats (533±189
pg/min).
Because ex vivo TXB2 production by allografts correlated
inversely with C1n, we explored the functional significance of
increased TX production in vivo. We acutely infused the TX
synthetase inhibitor UK-37248-01 into renal arteries of seven
donor kidneys 3 d after transplantation. As demonstrated in
Fig. 8, in vivo RBF increased from 16.53±5.21 ml min-' kg-'

Other renal excretory data from the acute UK-37248-01

was not altered by UK-37248-01 infusion (101±4 vs. 98±5
mmHg). Neither were allograft urine flow rate, percent frac￾tional excretion of sodium, sodium excretion, potassium ex￾cretion, or percent free water clearance/osmolar clearance
altered by UK-37248-01 infusion. However, as measured
during the control period before UK-37248-01 infusion, native
kidney Cin, CPAH, sodium excretion, potassium excretion, and
percent free water clearance/osmolar clearance were all signif￾icantly greater than values measured in the allograft. In native
kidneys, acute administration of UK-37248-01 had no signifi￾cant effect on any of these parameters.
Discussion
The mechanisms that reduce renal function during renal
allograft rejection are unknown. Focal perivascular mononu￾clear cell infiltrates are a prominent morphologic feature of
rejection, but the role that these cells play in altering renal
hemodynamics is unclear. Various renal, endothelial, and
hematopoietic cells are important sources of vasoactive hor￾mones. In particular, both monocytes and macrophages release
locally active cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase products (16-
22). These infiltrating cells may release vasoconstrictor eicos-

anoids or stimulate renal production of vasoconstrictors, which
reduce RBF and glomerular filtration rate (GFR). This hy￾pothesis has been suggested for other models of renal disease
including unilateral ureteral obstruction (1 1), renal vein con￾striction (23), and acute nephrotoxic serum nephritis (24).
Because mononuclear cell infiltration is so impressive in
rejecting allografts, renal transplantation rejection provides an
ideal setting in which to study the effects of these cells on
renal function.
In this study, we developed a model of renal transplantation
rejection that was predictable in progression and severity of
renal impairment. In this model, we demonstrated that TX
synthetic capacity of rejecting kidneys was significantly in￾creased. The in vivo TX synthetase inhibitor studies suggested
that increased TXA2 production may have a role in determining
renal function during allograft rejection. TX synthetase inhi￾bition had no effect on native kidney function. Therefore,
improvement in allograft function probably resulted from local
rather than systemic effects of the drug. The acute infusion of
UK-37248-01 into allograft renal arteries increased RBF by
58% and Cl,, by 29%. However, despite this improvement in
allograft function with UK-37248-01, RBF and C1n remained
below normal. Thus, increased TX synthesis is only one of
several factors that reduce renal function during acute rejection.
The cellular source of increased TX production by rejecting
kidneys cannot be determined from these studies. In our
model, increased TX production by allografts correlated with
progressive interstitial accumulation of chronic inflammatory
cells. Stimulated macrophages, lymphocytes, and leukocytes
can synthesize TXA2, PGE2, 6-keto-PGFia as well as a number
of lipoxygenase products (16-22). Thus, inflammatory
cells that infiltrated the allograft could have been the primary
source of increased eicosanoid production. In addition, lipox￾ygenase products released by leukocytes can stimulate TX
synthesis in other cells. Feuerstein et al. (25) reported that
incubation of rat peritoneal macrophages with leukotrienes C4
and D4 enhances the release of PGE2, 6-keto PGFi,, and
TXB2 in a dose dependent manner. Therefore, in this study,
leukotrienes from infiltrating leukocytes could have stimulated
production of eicosanoids by inflammatory cells or renal
parenchymal cells. Finally, platelet aggregation may also occur
in the vessels of rejecting kidneys. Platelets produce large
quantities of TXA2 (26), and they too could have contributed
to the increased TX production by ex vivo perfused allografts.
In other models of acute renal failure, leukocytes have
been implicated as a potential source of eicosanoids or as
stimulators of increased eicosanoid production. Okwegawa et
al. (11) have suggested that infiltrating mononuclear cells are
instrumental in the exaggerated renal TX and PG synthesis
that occurs with ureteral obstruction in rabbits. Schwartz et
al. (23) have demonstrated in the same species a similar
phenomenon associated with renal vein constriction. Lefkowith
et al. (27) have reported that treatment of hydronephrotic
rabbits with nitrogen mustard decreases leukocytic infiltration
and inhibits bradykinin-stimulated thromboxane production.
Davis and Needleman (28) demonstrated that pretreatment
with cyclophosphamide inhibits TX synthesis in hydronephrotic
rabbit kidneys. In our study, cyclophosphamide treatment
reduced both bradykinin-stimulated and unstimulated TXB2
production. This inhibition of TX production was associated
with a marked decrease in interstitial mononuclear cell infil￾tration and an improvement in both C1n and CPAH.
Renal tissue may also be an important source of enhanced
prostanoid production by rejecting kidneys. Isolated glomeruli
from normal rats synthesize PGE2, 6-keto-PGFIa, and TXB2
(29). Isolated glomeruli produce increased amounts of TXB2
during ureteral obstruction (30), acute nephrotoxic serum
nephritis (24), and glycerol-induced acute renal failure (31).
We have also shown that isolated proximal tubule suspensions
from normal rats can produce PGE2 and TXB2 (32). Thus,
altered prostanoid synthesis by the kidney, by infiltrating cells,
or by an interaction between these tissues may play a role in
the vasoconstriction of allograft rejection.
Acute allograft rejection has become an important clinical
problem because of the frequent use of renal transplantation
as a mode of therapy for end-stage renal disease. One of the
major problems in evaluating nonfunctioning allografts has

been the difficulty in differentiating acute tubular necrosis
from acute cellular rejection. In this study, allografts with
acute tubular necrosis 1-2 d after transplantation produced
minimal amounts of TXB2, as did cross-clamped controls.
However, kidneys 3-6 d after transplantation produced signif￾icantly increased amounts of TXB2. This observation suggests
that, under these experimental conditions, increased renal
TXB2 production may differentiate acute cellular rejection
from acute tubular necrosis. Furthermore, as much as 10-20%
of the reduced GFR and RBF measured in 3-day allografts
could be attributed directly to increased TX production. This
observation may have implications for the possible use of
specific TX synthetase inhibitors in the future therapy of acute
rejection. In this study, cyclophosphamide profoundly reduced
renal prostanoid production by the rejecting kidney. Cortico￾steroids, which are currently used in treating acute cellular
rejection, also alter eicosanoid metabolism by inhibiting phos￾pholipase A2 (33). Therefore, one of the beneficial effects of
corticosteroids on renal function during allograft rejection may
be related to reduced TXA2 synthesis. Since much of the
morbidity of acute rejection is attributable to drug therapy,
improving function with TX synthetase inhibitors may permit
reduced immunosuppressive therapy.
We were unable to detect a clear relationship between
rejection and PGE2 and 6-keto PGF1a production by ex vivo
perfused allografts. There was a tendency for the ratios of
PGE2/TXB2 and 6-keto PGFIa/TXB2 to decrease progressively
from days 2-6 after transplantation. These ratios were also
lower in rejecting kidneys compared with nontransplanted,
normal Lewis kidneys. The marked differences in the observed
renal synthetic capacity of TXB2, PGE2, and 6-keto PGF1a,
and the different responses to bradykinin stimulation and
cytolytic therapy suggest that these eicosanoids may be produced
by several different tissue types.
In summary, we developed a model of renal allograft
rejection that was predictable in onset and degree of functional
impairment. Renal TX synthesis in rejecting rat renal allografts
was increased and this increase played a role in decreasing
RBF and GFR. Although TX was not clearly the sole mediator
of this decrease in renal function, its effects may be significant.
The exact cellular source of increased TX production and the
mechanism of its release were not addressed in this study nor
did we study other important vasoconstrictors that may con￾tribute to altered renal hemodynamics. Our data suggest that
specific pharmacologic interventions that decrease TXA2 pro￾duction during acute rejection may be useful in preserving
allograft function.
