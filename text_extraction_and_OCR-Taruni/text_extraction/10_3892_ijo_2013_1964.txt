Abstract. Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing 
ligand (TRAIL) is a promising anticancer agent because its 
cytotoxicity is selective for tumor cells. Despite promising 
outcomes in clinical trials using this ligand, sustained clinical 
responses have been impeded because cancer cells acquire 
resistance to TRAIL-based therapies. Ginseng, a well-known 
food product consumed globally, has been reported to reduce 
fatigue and possess antioxidant and antitumor activities. We 
explored the sensitizing influence of a formulated red ginseng 
extract (RGE) on TRAIL-derived cell death in hepatocellular 
carcinoma (HCC) cell lines and the underlying molecular 
mechanisms responsible for TRAIL sensitization. We found 
that the RGE promoted TRAIL-derived apoptosis in HepG2, 
Huh-7 and Hep3B cell lines. We also found that death receptor 5 
expression was induced by the RGE and mediated by C/EBP 
homologous protein (CHOP). shRNA-induced downregula￾tion of CHOP expression effectively suppressed cell death 
induced by combined treatment with the RGE and TRAIL in 
the HepG2 cell line, indicating that RGE-related upregulation 
of the CHOP protein plays an important role in sensitizing 
TRAIL-derived apoptosis. In summary, we showed that the 
RGE sensitized human HCC cell lines to TRAIL-derived cell 
death and could be utilized as a dietary supplement in combi￾nation with cancer treatment.
Introduction
TRAIL, also known as Apo2L and TNFSF10, belongs to the 
tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily that induces cell 
death in various types of cancer cell lines in vivo and in vitro
but has little or no effect on normal cell lines. The cytotoxic 
effects of TRAIL are carried out by its functional receptors, 
death receptor 4 (DR4) and death receptor 5 (DR5) (also known 
as TRAIL-R1 and TRAIL-R2), and death inducing signaling 
complex (DISC). DISC formation involves recruitment of an 
adaptor molecule, Fas-associated death domain (FADD), as well 
as apical caspase-8 and caspase-10. DISC assembly results in the 
auto-catalytic activation of caspase-8 and caspase-10, which initi￾ates the caspase cascade, leading to apoptosis (1,2). Upon binding 
to DR4 and DR5, TRAIL activates the nuclear factor (NF)-κB 
and JNK signaling pathways (3). NF-κB plays an important 
role regulating anti- and pro‑apoptotic events, depending on the 
physiological environment (4). NF-κB mediates the expression of 
anti-apoptotic genes, such as members of the inhibitor of apop￾tosis (IAP) family (cIAP-1 and -2 and XIAP), cellular Flice-like 
inhibitory proteins (c-FLIP) and Bcl-2, all of which determine 
susceptibility to TRAIL-derived apoptosis (5,6).
TRAIL is regarded as a promising anticancer agent 
because of its selective cytotoxicity against transformed cell 
lines; however, the potential clinical use of TRAIL has been 
blocked because some tumor cell lines become resistant 
to TRAIL‑derived apoptosis (7,8). Resistance is generally 
induced by low expression of DR4/DR5 or high expression of 
IAP family members (8,9); thus, the discovery of agents that 
alleviate TRAIL resistance may allow the use of combined 
TRAIL-based therapeutic regimens to treat resistant cancers 
(10). Recombinant human TRAIL and several agonistic mono￾clonal antibodies are currently in phase II clinical trials. The 
agonistic antibodies include mapatumumab, which targets DR4, 
and lexatumumab, apomab, AMG655, CS-1008, and LBY-135, 
which target DR5 (11). However, increasing evidence indicates 
A formulated red ginseng extract upregulates CHOP
and increases TRAIL-mediated cytotoxicity in 
human hepatocellular carcinoma cells

that death receptor agonists alone may not be sufficient to effec￾tively activate apoptosis in many cancers.
Chemotherapy is not a standard treatment for hepatocellular 
carcinoma (HCC), and HCC is highly resistant to other conven￾tional anti-neoplastic agents (12,13). Recent studies have shown 
that many cancer cell lines are not susceptible to the cytotoxic 
effects of TRAIL (14); thus, the discovery of agents that alle￾viate TRAIL resistance may be useful for the establishment of 
TRAIL‑based combined regimens for improved HCC treatment.
A formulated red ginseng extract (RGE) derived from 
heat‑processed Panax ginseng C.A. Meyer, is a functional food 
and dietary supplement consumed worldwide and is used in 
traditional oriental medicine to increase energy and life expec￾tancy. RGE has been reported to reduce fatigue and to possess 
antioxidant and antitumor activities (15-17). Ginseng has 
been reported to possess antioxidant, antistress and immune￾stimulating activities. These activities require the scavenging of 
hydroxyl, 1-1-diphenyl-2-picryhydrazyl (DPPH) and superoxide 
radicals to decrease lipid peroxidation through chelation of tran￾sition metal ions and to reduce oxidative DNA damage caused 
by the Fenton reaction or UV light exposure (18). Ginseng sapo￾nins also protect human low-density lipoproteins from oxidative 
damage in vitro (19) and induce Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase 
expression at the transcriptional level (20).
Findings indicate that the RGE could be useful as a dietary 
supplement in a combined cancer treatment, as it sensitizes 
human HCC cell lines to TRAIL-derived cell death via 
a mechanism involving upregulation of DR5, which then 
enhances activation of the extrinsic apoptosis pathway. In this 
case, upregulation of DR5 is induced by C/EBP homologous 
(CHOP), an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress responsive 
element. shRNA-mediated downregulation of CHOP expres￾sion effectively suppresses cell death induced by RGE plus 
TRAIL in HepG2 cells, indicating that CHOP is essential for 
RGE-triggered enhancement of TRAIL-derived apoptosis. To 
summarize, data from the present study suggest that RGE may 
sensitize cells to TRAIL, thereby diminishing their resistance. 
RGE could be combined with TRAIL in a cocktail for use as a 
novel therapeutic strategy to more effectively treat HCC.
Materials and methods
Reagents. The following reagents were purchased and 
used according to the manufacturer's instructions: gluta￾thione S-transferase (GST)-TRAIL and anti-DR5 antibodies 
were from Koma Biotechnologies (Seoul, Korea); anti‑caspase 3, 
anti-PARP and anti-CHOP antibodies were from Cell Signaling 
Technology; anti-DR4 antibody was from Rockland; anti-tubulin 
antibody was from Abcam; anti-actin antibody, thapsigargin 
(Tg), necrostatin-1, NAC and BHA were from Sigma; and zVAD 
was from R&D Systems. A formulated RGE was provided by 
the Korea Ginseng Corporation (Seoul, Korea).
Cell culture. The SK-Hep1, HepG2 and Hep3B cell lines were 
grown on culture plates in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium 
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mM gluta￾mine, 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 µg/ml streptomycin. Huh-7 
cells were grown on culture plates in RPMI‑1640 medium 
supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mM glutamine, 100 U/ml peni￾cillin and 100 µg/ml streptomycin. A commercially available 
normal liver cell line (HL-7702) was grown on culture plates 
in RPMI‑1640 medium supplemented with 20% FBS, 2 mM 
glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 µg/ml streptomycin.
Western blot analysis. Upon treatment, cell lines were lysed 
in 20 mM Tris (pH 7.0), 250 mM NaCl, 3 mM EDTA, 3 mM 
EGTA, 2 mM DTT, 0.5% NP-40, 0.5 mM PMSF, 20 mM 
β-glycerol phosphate, 1 mM sodium vanadate and 1 µg/ml 
leupeptin. Lysates were loaded onto 10 or 12% SDS-PAGE gels. 
Following transfer and blotting, the proteins of interest were 
visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Pierce) and 
analyzed.
Cytotoxicity assays. Viable cells were measured by the MTT 
assay (dual labeling method with 2 µM calcein-AM and 
4 µM EthD-1), and MTT absorbance was read at 570 nm. 
Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) leakage was quantified using 
a cytotoxicity detection kit (Promega). Images were recorded 
by microscope and the data presented are from at least three 
independent experiments.
Lentiviral shRNA experiments. shRNA-encoding plasmids were 
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, and the targets were coding 
region sequences or the 3' untranslated region of CHOP mRNA 
(NM: 004083). The 293T cell line (LV900A-1) was transfected 
with lentiviral plasmids using Lipofectamine 2000 transfection 
reagent (Invitrogen, 11668019). HepG2 cell lines were infected 
with pseudoviral particles collected from the 293T cell line 
2 days after transfection in the presence of Polybrene (8 µg/ml). 
The lentivirus-infected HepG2 cell line was then isolated by 
puromycin (1 µg/ml) resistance 2 days after infection, and 
knockdown of CHOP was confirmed by western blot analysis. 
CHOP knockdown cell lines were seeded on 6-well plates and 
treated with the RGE or Tg for the times indicated for each 
experiment and were analyzed by western blot analysis.
Results and Discussion
Analysis of the formulated RGE. A high-performance liquid 
chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) method was used 
for the targeted 14 ginsenosides to determine the ginsenoside 
content in the formulated RGE. Butanol extracts of white, red 
and sun ginseng were employed to isolate the standard ginsen￾osides, and each ginsenoside was isolated and purified by silica 
gel chromatography or preparative LC (21,22). Calibration 
curves for each ginsenoside standard were plotted (data not 
shown), and the ginsenoside contents of the formulated RGE 
were calculated (Fig. 1, Table I). Korean red ginseng has been 
reported to induce antitumor and immune-stimulating, antistress 
and antioxidant activities. The cytoprotective and chemoprotec￾tive properties of ginseng have been attributed to its ability to 
reduce oxidative or nitrosative stress (23-25). Previous studies 
have suggested that RGE, a major component of ginseng, 
inhibits cancer cell propagation and metastasis (24). Based on 
these observations, we tested the cytotoxicity of the RGE in the 
HepG2 cell lines. As shown in Fig. 2A, RGE concentrations up 
to 10 mg/ml showed no significant effects on cells (left panel) 
and no decrease in viability, as measured by LDH release (right 
panel). As a positive control, we treated the HepG2 cell lines 
with TRAIL (50 ng/ml) and observed the induction of cell

death, as evidenced by the EthD‑1-positive cell line. We found 
that TRAIL (25 ng/ml) induced poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 
(PARP) cleavage at 12 h, but that the RGE alone had little effect 
on PARP and caspase-3 cleavage (Fig. 2B).
TRAIL-derived cell death was augmented in the HCC 
cell lines by pretreatment with the RGE. Because our data 
suggested that the RGE alone has no obvious effect on cancer 
cell cytotoxicity, we then measured the sensitization effect of 
the RGE on TRAIL-derived cell death. When the RGE and 
TRAIL were added to cells consecutively, dramatic cell death 
occurred according to the results of the MTT colorimetric assay 
(Fig. 2C). Concentrations of TRAIL >50 ng/ml were required 
to induce significant cytotoxicity; however, concentrations of 
TRAIL <25 ng/ml showed minimal cytotoxicity. Viability 
measurements from concentration curves obtained from 1:2 
serial dilutions demonstrated that 10 mg/ml of the RGE was 
necessary to achieve robust TRAIL-derived cell death (data not 
shown), but RGE alone showed a minimal cytotoxic effect. We 
further tested the sensitization effect in the Hep3B and Huh-7 
cell lines. A similar degree of TRAIL (25 ng/ml) sensitization 
was observed, indicating that this effect was universal in HCC 
cell lines (Fig. 3A). In contrast, a combination of the RGE and 
TRAIL sensitize normal human liver cell lines, confirming that 
this sensitization was specific to the tumor cell lines (Fig. 3B).
One of the primary problems when clinically applying 
TRAIL as a cancer therapeutic agent is resistance. One effective 
strategy to surmount this issue would be to discover anticancer 
agents for use in combination therapy (26-29). Several natural 
products and other chemical compounds have been identified 
that sensitize cancer cell lines to TRAIL-derived apoptosis. In 
this study, we tested a formulated RGE that has been suggested 
to possess anticancer properties and the results provide 
substantial evidence that the RGE was capable of sensitizing

HCC to TRAIL-derived apoptosis by upregulating the CHOP, 
which then induced DR5 expression.
Sensitization effect of the RGE in TRAIL-derived cell death is 
caspase-dependent. We next examined the effects of the RGE 
on TRAIL activation of the caspase cascade in the SK-Hep1 
cell line. As shown in Fig. 3C, treatment with a combination of 
RGE and TRAIL induced cleavage of caspase-3 and PARP, a 
well-established caspase substrate, whereas treatment with the 
RGE alone did not. In addition, cell death was apoptotic because 
necrostatin-1 failed to inhibit cell death, as shown in Fig. 3D. To 
further confirm RGE and TRAIL-derived apoptosis, cells were

cultured on coverslips and treated with RGE, TRAIL or RGE 
plus TRAIL. The cells were fixed and stained with DAPI after 
16-18 h, and examined for morphologic changes such as nuclear 
DNA fragmentation and/or condensation, which are indicative 
of apoptotic death. As shown in Fig. 3E, the RGE alone had no 
clear effect on nuclear DNA fragmentation and/or condensation, 
but RGE pretreatment significantly augmented TRAIL-derived 
nuclear DNA fragmentation and/or condensation in HepG2 
cells.

DR5 and upregulation of DcR1 and DcR2 (8,30-32). We 
examined TRAIL receptor protein levels in cells treated with 
the RGE to explore the molecular mechanisms underlying 
the sensitization effect of the RGE to TRAIL-derived cell 
death. Treatment with the RGE significantly increased the 
expression of DR5 in a dose-dependent manner in HepG2 
cells (Fig. 4A), although no clear changes were found in DR4 
expression (Fig. 4B). We compared the effects of the RGE 
in three different HCC cell lines to determine whether this 
effect was cell-type specific (Fig. 4C). All cell lines tested 
showed upregulated DR5 expression following the RGE treat￾ment, suggesting that the effects of RGE on the upregulation 
of DR5 are not cell-type specific.

Many mechanisms have been elucidated for inducing DR5, 
including ER stress, p53 induction, reactive oxygen species 
(ROS) generation and NF-κB/MAPK activation (33-35). It has 
been suggested that C/EBP homologous protein/GADD153, 
a transcription factor of the C/EBP family that has a role in 
ER stress, is involved in activating DR5 expression and thus 
contributes to the effectiveness of the RGE and TRAIL 
combined therapy (36-38). The RGE treatment increased 
CHOP levels in the HepG2 cell lines corresponding to its sensi￾tization effect on TRAIL-derived cell death (Fig. 5A-C). As 
shown in Fig. 5D, RGE-induced CHOP upregulation preceded 
the increase in DR5 levels. Such a temporal pattern further 
supports the notion that CHOP plays a role in the activation of 
DR5 expression by the RGE. As CHOP is a major transcrip￾tion factor induced by ER stress, we examined whether RGE 
treatment would induce ER stress in HCC. Thus, we probed 
for two markers of ER stress: Ser-51 phosphorylation of eIF2α
(P-eIF2α) and induction of the ER chaperone protein GRP78. 
As shown in Fig. 5E, the RGE upregulated C/EBP homologous 
protein but did not induce GRP78 or eIF2α phosphorylation in 
the HepG2 cell lines, indicating that the RGE was capable of 
over-expressed the CHOP without substantively affecting ER 
stress. However, the RGE did not influence CHOP expression 
in the normal liver cell lines, which strongly agrees with the 
observation that the RGE did not boost the effect of TRAIL 
in the normal cell lines (Fig. 3B). Additionally, the RGE was 
unable to induce expression of the C/EBP homologous protein 
or other ER stress markers in the normal cell lines (Fig. 5F).
When investigating the induction of the TRAIL receptors 
DR4 and DR5 in tumors it is very important to assess suscep￾tibility of the tumor to TRAIL treatment (39). Several studies 
have shown that high expression of the TRAIL receptors DR4 
and DR5 facilitates sensitization of cancer cells to TRAIL￾derived cell death (1,40). One therapeutic approach being tested 
is to induce the expression of death receptors, including DR4 
and particularly DR5, by small molecules, which results in 
TRAIL‑derived tumor cell death or sensitization of TRAIL￾resistant cell lines to cell death (33). Furthermore, DR5 
expression levels are highly correlated with TRAIL, which 
binds to its receptors, DR4 and DR5, and activates the extrinsic 
apoptosis pathway (34,41,42). In the present study, we found 
that the improved effects of the combination therapy were 
primarily dependent upon control of DR5 induction. We also 
found that the combination therapy induced apoptosis in the

presence of ROS (Fig. 6), suggesting that ROS do not contribute 
to RGE-facilitated sensitization of TRAIL-derived cell death.
Increased expression of CHOP is related to DR5 upregulation. 
Tg treatment was compared with RGE treatment to confirm that 
upregulation of CHOP plays a key role in the RGE sensitiza￾tion effect, as shown in Fig. 7A (43,44). Next, we established 
stable cell lines for knockdown of the C/EBP homologous 
protein using a lentiviral shRNA system. As shown in Fig. 7B, 
we confirmed knockdown of CHOP. In addition, knockdown 
of CHOP inhibited the robust upregulation of CHOP induced 
by Tg. We then examined the effect of CHOP knockdown on 
RGE-induced sensitization to TRAIL-derived cell death. CHOP 
knockdown inhibited the effect of the RGE plus TRAIL treat￾ment in HepG2 cell lines, suggesting that augmentation of cell 
death by the RGE combined treatment in HCC was mediated by 
CHOP expression (Fig. 7C).
Activation of NF-κB in cancer cell lines contributes to the 
induction of DR5 as well as resistance to TRAIL-derived apop￾tosis. Therefore, we examined whether the RGE might regulate 
NF-κB to facilitate DR5 upregulation and, consequently, 
sensitize cell lines to TRAIL-derived apoptosis. As shown in 
Fig. 7D, degradation and phosphorylation of IκBα did not occur 
in response to the RGE. In addition, the RGE did not affect 
TRAIL-derived NF-κB activation, suggesting that RGE-induced 
sensitization to cell death is not mediated by NF-κB. Although 
TRAIL is capable of activating NF-κB in some cancer cell lines 
and the induction of DR5 is linked to NF-κB activation, acti￾vated NF-κB also upregulates the anti‑apoptotic gene Bcl-xL, 
effectively blocking TRAIL‑derived apoptosis (10,27,34). We 
failed to detect upregulation of Bcl-xL in response to RGE 
treatment (data not shown), which further indicates that NF-κB 
was activated by the RGE. Additionally, RGE-induced CHOP 
upregulation was not caused by ER stress, which can lead to 
apoptosis in HCC cell lines. Inducing CHOP expression or 
TRAIL sensitization was unsuccessful when RGE was applied 
to the normal cell line HL7702, suggesting that CHOP protein 
upregulation by the RGE is specific to the tumor cell lines.
Although we have not tested the antitumor activity of the 
RGE in vivo, the formulated RGE examined could potentially 
be further developed as an important chemosensitizer to be 
utilized as a dietary supplement with anticancer drugs.
