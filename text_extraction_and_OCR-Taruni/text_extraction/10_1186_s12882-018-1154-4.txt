Abstract
Background: The effect of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection on the risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is
controversial. We examined the prospective association between hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) serology status
and incident CKD in a large cohort of men and women.
Methods: Cohort study of 299,913 adults free of CKD at baseline who underwent health screening exams between
January 2002 and December 2016 in South Korea. Incident CKD was defined as the development of an estimated
glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 60 ml/min/1.73m2 and/or proteinuria.
Results: Over 1,673,701 person-years of follow-up, we observed 13,924 incident cases of CKD (3225 cases of eGFR
< 60 ml/min/1.73m2 and 11,072 cases of proteinuria). In fully adjusted models comparing positive to negative
HBsAg participants, the hazard ratio (HR, 95% confidence interval) for incident CKD was 1.11 (1.03–1.21; P = 0.01).
The corresponding HR for incident proteinuria and for eGFR < 60 ml/min/1.73m2 were 1.23 (1.12–1.35; P < 0.001)
and 0.89 (0.73–1.07; P = 0.21), respectively. The associations were similar across categories of liver enzyme levels at
baseline.
Conclusion: In this large cohort, HBsAg positive serology was associated with higher risk of incident CKD, and we
provide novel evidence that this association was due to a higher incidence of proteinuria in HBsAg positive
participants. Our study adds to the growing body of evidence suggesting that chronic HBV infection may be a
contributor to the increasing incidence of CKD.

Background
Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is one of the
major causes of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcin￾oma worldwide [1]. In addition to liver disease, HBV in￾fection has been associated with extra-hepatic
complications [2]. For example, various forms of kidney
injury have been described in relation to HBV, including
membranous nephropathy, membranoproliferative glom￾erulonephritis, and polyarteritis nodosa [3].
HBV-associated nephropathy most commonly presents
with proteinuria or nephrotic syndrome [4], which may
be caused by immune complex deposition, by
virus-induced immunologic responses [3], or by direct
glomerular and tubular injury by HBV [5]. It is unclear,
however, whether exposure to HBV is associated with an
increased risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD).
Previous longitudinal studies from Taiwan, where HBV
infection is endemic, and China showed that positive
hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) serology was associ￾ated with increased risk of incident CKD [6, 7] and
end-stage renal disease (ESRD) [8]. However, incident
CKD and ESRD were identified from claims data using
International Classification of Diseases, Ninth or Tenth

Revision (ICD-9 or ICD-10), rather than using bio￾markers of kidney function or kidney damage. The pres￾ence of hepatitis B core (anti-HBc) antibodies, on the
contrary, was not associated with a higher incidence of
CKD over 5 years of follow-up in a Chinese population
undergoing screening exams [9]. The results from
cross-sectional studies were also inconsistent, with most
studies showing no association between HBV infection
and the prevalence of CKD and one study showing an
inverse association [10–13].
Chronic liver disease patients with coexisting renal im￾pairment tend to have poorer outcomes than those with
preserved renal function [14]. Therefore, early detection
of CKD is of particular importance in the long-term
management and prognosis of patients with chronic liver
disease. We thus aimed to evaluate the prospective asso￾ciation between HBV infection and incident CKD, de￾fined using estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)
and proteinuria, in a large cohort of men and women
with normal renal function at baseline who participated
in regular health screening examinations in South Korea.
Methods
Study population
The Kangbuk Samsung Health Study is a cohort study of
adult men and women who underwent annual or
biennial comprehensive medical health examinations at
the two Kangbuk Samsung Hospital Total Healthcare
Centers located in Seoul and Suwon, South Korea.
[15, 16].
Among participants with at least one follow-up visit be￾tween January 1, 2002 and December 31, 2016 (n = 320,069),
we excluded participants with any of the following condi￾tions at baseline: prevalent CKD (n = 14,548), ultrasound
evidence of chronic nephritis, structural kidney disease,
kidney surgery, or kidney tumor, or kidney transplantation
(n = 1724); self-reported history of cancer (n = 3667); ultra￾sound findings of liver tumor, liver surgery, or liver trans￾plantation (n = 198). After excluding 19,645 participants, the
number of eligible participants was 300,424 (170,214 men
and 130,210 women). We further excluded participants with
missing information on HBsAg serology, eGFR, body mass
index (BMI), fasting blood glucose, or systolic blood pressure
at baseline (n = 301). The final sample included 299,913 par￾ticipants (169,994 men and 129,919 women; Fig. 1).
This study was approved by the Kangbuk Samsung
Hospital Institutional Review Board that waived the re￾quirement for informed consent as we only used
de-identified data obtained as part of routine health
screening exams.
Data collection
As part of the comprehensive health exam, study partici￾pants provided detailed information on medical history,
family history, medication use, smoking habits, alcohol

intake, physical activity, and socioeconomic status at
each visit using a standardized self-administered ques￾tionnaire at each visit. Smoking categories were defined
as never, former, and current smokers. Current alcohol
intake was estimated in grams per day. Physical activity
was categorized based on the frequency of moderate- or
vigorous-intensity exercise per week (< 3 or ≥ 3 times
per week). Education level was categorized as less than
college degree and college degree or higher.
Anthropometric measurements, including height,
weight, and blood pressure, were measured at each visit
by trained staff members under standard conditions.
BMI was calculated as weight in kilograms divided by
height in meters squared (kg/m2
). Hypertension was de￾fined as systolic blood pressure ≥ 140 mmHg, diastolic
blood pressure ≥ 90 mmHg, self-reported history of
hypertension, or self-reported use of antihypertensive
medication.
The presence of fatty liver disease was determined at
each visit by abdominal ultrasonography, which was a
routine part of the health exam for all participants. Ex￾perienced radiologists at each center performed the
exam using LOGIQ 700 MR machines with 3.5-MHz
transducers (GE, Milwaukee, WI, USA). Fatty liver dis￾ease was diagnosed if there was diffuse hyperechoic par￾enchyma compared to that of the kidney or spleen [17].
Cirrhosis diagnosis was based on the presence of coarse
and inhomogeneous parenchyma, caudate hypertrophy,
surface nodularity, signs of portal hypertension, or re￾generative nodules on ultrasonography.
Laboratory determinations
At each visit, serum samples from all participants
were tested for complete blood count, blood chemis￾try (including, but not limited to, renal function tests
and liver function tests), and viral hepatitis serology,
and urine samples were tested for presence of
proteinuria.
Serum samples were analyzed for HBsAg using immu￾noradiometric assays (Radim, Via del Mare, Italy) in the
Seoul center from 2002 to 2009 and in the Suwon center
from 2002 to 2006, and using an electrochemilumines￾cent immunoassay (Modular E170; Roche Diagnostics)
in both centers afterwards. A blood chemistry panel
including alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate
aminotransferase (AST), gamma-glutamyl transferase
(GGT), serum creatinine and serum glucose, was mea￾sured in fasting samples using Bayer Reagent Packs on
an Advia 1650TM Autoanalyzer (Bayer Diagnostics,
Medfeld, MA, USA) between 2002 and February 2010 at
the Seoul center and between 2002 and September 2006
at the Suwon center, and on a Modular Analytics D2400
analyzer (Roche Diagnostics, Tokyo, Japan) in both cen￾ters afterwards.
Estimated GFR was calculated using the 4-variable
Modification on Diet in Renal Disease Study equation,
and CKD was defined as an eGFR < 60 ml/min/1.73m2
and/or the presence of proteinuria [18]. Diabetes was de￾fined as a fasting serum glucose ≥126 mg/dl, a
self-reported physician diagnosis, or current use of insu￾lin or other hypoglycemic agents.
Urine dipsticks (URiSCAN Urine test strips, YD Diag￾nostics) were used to measure urine protein
semi-quantitatively for all participants and were reported
in 6 grades (absent, trace, 1+, 2+, 3+, and 4+). Presence of
proteinuria was defined as grade 1+ or greater.
The Laboratory Medicine Department at Kangbuk
Samsung Hospital has been accredited by the Korean
Society of Laboratory Medicine (KSLM) and the Korean
Association of Quality Assurance for Clinical Laborator￾ies (KAQACL). The laboratory also participates in the
survey proficiency testing provided by the College of
American Pathologists (CAP).
Statistical analysis
Baseline variables were summarized by HBsAg status as
number (proportion) for categorical variables and mean
(standard deviation) or median (interquartile range) for
continuous variables, and compared using χ2 tests, Stu￾dent’s t-tests, or signed-rank sum tests as appropriate.
Participants free of CKD at baseline were followed
from the baseline visit until the development of CKD, or
until the last screening visit. Development of CKD was
evaluated at each visit based on the eGFR and the pres￾ence of proteinuria. Because the development of CKD
was detected during a study visit but the exact date of
its onset could not be determined, we used a parametric
proportional hazards model to take into account this
type of interval censoring (stpm command in Stata) [19].
The baseline hazard function was parametrized with re￾stricted cubic splines in log time with four degrees of
freedom. We estimated hazard ratios (HR) and 95% con￾fidence intervals (CI) for incident CKD comparing
HBsAg positive with HBsAg negative participants. To
control for potential confounders, we used 3 models
with progressive degrees of adjustment: Model 1 was ad￾justed for age, sex, study center, and baseline eGFR;
Model 2 was further adjusted for smoking status, alcohol
intake, level of education, physical activity, and BMI; and
Model 3 was further adjusted for the presence of hyper￾tension, diabetes, and fatty liver disease. We created in￾dicator variables for missing values for smoking status
(5.7%), alcohol intake (5.4%), level of education (26.5%),
and physical activity (1.3%). There were no missing
values for the presence of hypertension, diabetes, and
fatty liver disease. The same analyses were also per￾formed separately for the development of eGFR < 60 ml/
min/1.73m2 and for the development of proteinuria.

We performed three sensitivity analyses. Elevated
serum ALT levels indicate active inflammation of the
liver cells and predict prognosis [20, 21]. Because the as￾sociation of HBsAg status with kidney function may dif￾fer by the severity of inflammation in the liver, we
stratified the analyses by baseline ALT level (elevated
ALT defined as ALT > 41 U/l for males and ALT > 33 U/
l for females). In addition, we excluded participants with
evidence of liver cirrhosis on ultrasound because
patients with liver cirrhosis are more susceptible to de￾veloping CKD [22–24]. Finally, we excluded participants
who were positive for hepatitis C virus antibody (HCV
Ab) because HCV infection can increase the risk of inci￾dent CKD [25, 26].
All statistical analyses were performed with Stata ver￾sion 14.0 (StataCorp LP, College Station, Texas).
Two-sided P values less than 0.05 were considered sta￾tistically significant.
Results
The mean (SD) age of study participants was 37.3 (SD
7.9) years (Table 1). The prevalence of positive HBsAg
serology was 3.7% (n = 11,209). Compared to seronega￾tive individuals, those with positive HBsAg serology were
more likely to be older, male, current smoker, and
frequently engaged in vigorous exercise, to have higher
levels of BMI, and liver enzymes, and to have lower alco￾hol intake, prevalence of fatty liver disease and eGFR
levels. The prevalence of hypertension and diabetes were
not significantly different between those with and with￾out HBsAg (Table 1).
The mean duration of follow-up was 5.6 years
(1,673,701 person-years of follow-up). Overall, there
were 13,924 new cases of CKD (incidence rate 8.3 per
1000 person-years). By different definitions of CKD,
there were 3225 new cases of eGFR < 60 ml/min/
1.73m2 and 11,072 new cases of proteinuria during
follow-up (incidence rates of 1.9 and 6.6 per 1000
person-years, respectively). Participants who developed
CKD were older, had higher levels of liver enzymes
and serum glucose, had lower eGFR levels, and were
more likely to have other comorbidities, such as
hypertension, diabetes, and fatty liver disease at base￾line (Additional file 1: Table S1).
There were 609 incident cases of CKD among 11,209
HBsAg positive participants and 13,315 incident cases of
CKD among 288,704 HBsAg negative participants (inci￾dence rates of 9.3 and 8.3 per 1000 person-years, re￾spectively; Table 2). In fully adjusted models, the HR
comparing HBsAg positive participants to HBsAg nega￾tive participants was 1.11 (95% CI 1.03–1.21; Table 2
and Fig. 2). In additional analyses excluding 215 partici￾pants who reported ever having been treated for viral
hepatitis at baseline or over follow-up, the fully adjusted
HR for incident CKD comparing HBsAg positive partici￾pants to HBsAg negative participants was 1.11 (95% CI
1.02–1.21).
When the analyses were performed separately for each
CKD component, the association between HBsAg ser￾ology and kidney outcomes was limited to incident pro￾teinuria. In fully adjusted models, the HR for incident
proteinuria comparing HBsAg positive to HBsAg nega￾tive participants was 1.23 (95% CI 1.12–1.35), whereas
the corresponding HR for eGFR < 60 ml/min/1.73m2
was 0.89 (95% CI 0.73–1.07; Table 2 and Fig. 2). After
excluding participants who reported ever having been
treated for viral hepatitis at baseline or over follow-up,
the corresponding HR for incident proteinuria was 1.23
(95% CI 1.12–1.35;) and for eGFR < 60 ml/min/1.73m2
was 0.88 (95% CI 0.73–1.07).
In sensitivity analyses, the association between
HBsAg serology and kidney outcomes was similar in
participants with normal and with elevated ALT levels
at baseline (Additional file 1: Table S2). Similarly, the
findings were essentially unchanged after excluding
participants with ultrasound evidence of liver cirrhosis
(Additional file 1: Table S3) and after excluding par￾ticipants with positive HCV Ab serology (Additional
file 1: Table S4).

Discussion
In this large cohort of adults without clinically apparent
kidney disease, HBsAg positive participants had a higher
incidence risk of CKD compared to HBsAg negative par￾ticipants. The increased risk was driven by development
of proteinuria, although the number of HBsAg positive
participants who developed eGFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m2
was small. The results were similar in participants with
normal or with elevated liver enzyme levels at baseline,
and after excluding participants with cirrhosis or with
positive HCV antibodies. Since chronic hepatitis B infec￾tion is highly prevalent in many countries, our findings
suggest that it may be contributing to the global burden
of CKD.
The role of hepatitis B infection in the development of
CKD is controversial. In a meta-analysis of 4 cohort

Fig. 2 Adjusted cumulative incidence of chronic kidney disease by HBsAg serology at baselineParametric cumulative incidence curves (smooth

weighted by stabilized inverse probability weights and stratified by HBsAg serology status. Confounders used to estimate inverse probability
weights were measured at baseline, and included age (< 30, 30–34, 35–39, 40–44, 45–49, 50–54, 55–59 or ≥ 60 years), sex (male or female), study

studies, the pooled HR for CKD comparing participants
with HBV infection to those without HBV infection was
2.2 (95% CI 0.95–3.50) [27], but there was substantial
heterogeneity across studies. In another meta-analysis of
cohort, cross-sectional, and case-control studies in Asian
populations, there was no association between HBsAg
serology and reduced eGFR (adjusted risk ratio 0.95;
95% CI 0.72–1.26) or proteinuria (adjusted risk ratio
1.00; 95% CI 0.83–1.20) [28].
The largest study in both meta-analyses, a nationwide
cohort from Taiwan that used claims data to evaluate
the association between chronic HBV infection with in￾cident CKD [6] and incident ESRD [8], found very high
HRs (2.58 and 3.85 for CKD and ESRD, respectively). In
the large China Kadoori Biobank cohort, participants
with HBsAg had higher incidence of CKD compared to
participants without HBsAg (adjusted HR 1.37; 95% CI
1.18–1.60). CKD was defined using ICD-10 codes from
national health insurance system claims data [7].
Claims-based studies may have limited sensitivity to de￾tect asymptomatic HBV infection, and are likely to cap￾ture more severe, symptomatic cases of HBV infection
and kidney diseases. Claims-based data have also a lim￾ited ability to identify participants with prevalent CKD
at baseline and with asymptomatic or early stages of
chronic kidney disease, and they are prone to surveil￾lance bias as patients with a diagnosis of HBV infection
may be more likely to be tested for kidney function, and
vice versa. Furthermore, using ICD codes does not dis￾tinguish whether incident CKD was mainly caused by re￾duced eGFR or by the development of proteinuria. In
our study, we used repeated measurements of eGFR and
proteinuria in participants undergoing regular health
screening exam to define incident CKD, which allowed
us to evaluate the different mechanisms of developing
CKD separately and to identify CKD in otherwise
healthy participants.
In a smaller cohort of health screening examinees in
China, there was no association between the presence of
anti-HBc antibodies and the incidence of reduced eGFR,
proteinuria, or CKD over a 5-year period. The presence
of anti-HBc antibodies, however, cannot differentiate re￾solved HBV infections from chronic active HBV infec￾tions [9]. In our analysis, we used a positive HBsAg test
as a marker of exposure. In East Asian countries, includ￾ing China and Korea, HBV is most often transmitted
vertically at birth, and a positive HBsAg test in adults
most likely represents chronic HBV infection [29].
In three cross-sectional studies conducted also in
East Asian countries, positive HBsAg serology was
not associated with an increased risk of prevalent
proteinuria [11, 13, 30]. In contrast, the significant as￾sociation between HBsAg serology and incidence of
CKD in the present study was due to incident
proteinuria, with no clear association between HBsAg
serology and the incidence of reduced eGFR. Our
prospective study suggests that the increased inci￾dence of CKD in HBsAg positive subjects is mainly
due to an increased incidence of proteinuria. This
finding is also supported by the fact that
HBV-associated nephropathies, such as membranous
nephropathy and membranoproliferative glomerulo￾nephritis, most commonly present with proteinuria or
nephrotic syndrome.
The prevalence of CKD among HBsAg positive sub￾jects ranges from 0.4 to 11.4%, but it tends to be higher
among those with elevated ALT [10, 11, 31]. In our
study, the incidence of CKD was higher in participants
with elevated ALT levels (12.2 per 1000 person-years)
than in participants with normal ALT levels at baseline
(7.7 per 1000 person-years). HBV-associated nephropa￾thy is more common when there is active replication of
the virus or active inflammation in liver cells (immune
tolerant or immune clearance phase) than when the viral
burden and liver enzyme levels are low (inactive carrier
phase) [3]. In our study, however, the association be￾tween positive HBV serology and incidence of CKD was
similar across baseline ALT level categories, suggesting
that the risk of kidney damage is elevated in all stages of
HBV infection, even in the absence of active viral repli￾cation or inflammation.
Our findings are consistent with those from basic re￾search studies. HBV-associated nephropathy is mainly
due to immunological processes, particularly immune
complex deposition in the kidney [3]. The circulating
antigen-antibody complex formed at the acute exposure
to HBV may continue to damage the glomerular struc￾ture even when the virus is not actively replicating, lead￾ing to proteinuria. Indeed, the most common types of
HBV-associated nephropathy, such as membranous
nephropathy and membranoproliferative glomerulo￾nephritis, involve proteinuria. In addition to immuno￾logic mechanisms, the virus may damage the kidney
either directly or through apoptosis. HBV DNA has been
identified both in glomerular and in tubular cells [3, 5],
and it may promote apoptosis of renal tubular cells
through upregulation of the Fas pathway [32]. In our
study, we did not have histologic diagnosis of the type of
kidney damage or information about potential mechanis￾tic pathways. Additional studies are needed to better
understand the mechanisms underlying the association
between HBV infection and kidney damage.
There are a few limitations to our study. We used
urine dipsticks to identify proteinuria, but dipsticks may
not be sensitive enough to detect low levels of protein￾uria [33]. Furthermore, we defined CKD using a single

markers of damage for at least 3 months [34]. These
sources of measurement error, however, are random
with respect to exposure and would tend to underesti￾mate the underlying associations. Second, our study may
not have been long enough to see the effect of HBV on
reduction in eGFR, especially since our participants were
relatively young and healthy with stable liver function
and low prevalence of underlying comorbidities. Third,
we did not have information on the presence of hepa￾titis B e-antigen, on HBV DNA titers, or detailed his￾tory on HBV treatment (although we know which
participants received treatment for viral hepatitis from
self-reports). Treatment with oral antiviral agents may
decrease renal function in chronic hepatitis B pa￾tients, whereas their effects on the development of
proteinuria is less certain [35, 36] Tenofovir, which
may cause both reduction in renal function and tubu￾lar damage, was introduced to Korea in 2012 and is
unlikely to be the cause of higher incidence of pro￾teinuria in HBsAg positive participants in our study.
In addition, excluding participants who reported hav￾ing ever been treated for viral hepatitis at baseline or
over follow-up did not change our results. Finally,
our study population was comprised of Korean men
and women participating in regular health screening
exams and our findings may not generalize to other
race/ethnicity groups.
There are also several strengths to the study. In
addition to the large sample size, our study participants
were relatively young and healthy. As a result, the asso￾ciation between HBsAg and incident CKD is less likely
to be confounded by comorbidities and medication use
than studies conducted in elderly cohorts. In addition,
detailed health screening information on anthropometric
measures, lifestyle behaviors, medical history, and la￾boratory tests allowed us to account for multiple poten￾tial confounders. Finally, we measured urine protein in
addition to eGFR and we were able to evaluate the asso￾ciation of HBsAg with eGFR and with proteinuria
separately.
Conclusion
In conclusion, our study provides evidence to support
an association between HBsAg positive serology and
higher incidence of CKD. More specifically, we provide
novel evidence that this association is due to a higher in￾cidence of proteinuria in HBsAg positive compared to
HBsAg negative subjects. Studies with detailed informa￾tion on HBV replication status, HBV treatment history,
and longer follow-up are needed to provide further
insight to the association between HBV and CKD. Be￾cause patients with both chronic liver disease and CKD
have much poorer prognosis and higher mortality than
those with either condition, prevention and early
detection of kidney disease is essential in patients with
chronic HBV infection.
