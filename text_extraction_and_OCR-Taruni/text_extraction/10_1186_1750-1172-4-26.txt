Abstract
Background: Diffuse parenchymal lung diseases (DPLD) in children represent a rare and
heterogeneous group of chronic pulmonary disorders. Despite substantial advances in genetics and
pathomechanisms, these often lethal diseases are still under-diagnosed. This is due to the fact that
(i) the incidence is low, and (ii) clinical presentation, (iii) disease classification and (iv) specific
treatment options are largely unknown.
Methods: Here we systematically assessed the incidence, the presentation, the diagnostic yield
and treatments of pediatric DPLD in Germany, using the Surveillance Unit for Rare Paediatric
Disorders (ESPED).
Results: The incidence of DPLD was 1.32 new cases per 1 million of children per year. The
majority of these children were diagnosed within the first year of life. Overall survival was 87%.
Using centralized data entry and stratification tools, the patients were categorized into an advanced
classification system based on diagnostic algorithms, including clinical presentations, genetics and/
or histology. Combining molecular and clinical information, this survey provides an etiological
overview and specific diagnostic recommendations for children with DPLD.
Conclusions: Standardized surveys and systematic classifications are valuable tools for the clinical
handling of children with DPLD and aim to improve the disease understanding and the prognosis
of these rare detrimental lung diseases.

Background
Diffuse parenchymal lung diseases (DPLD) in children,
also called pediatric interstitial lung diseases, comprise a
large and heterogeneous group of chronic pulmonary dis￾orders [1,2]. These diseases are characterized by impaired
gas exchange and radiological diffuse infiltrates and have
a substantial morbidity and mortality. The major current
challenges in DPLD are difficulties with a lack of confi￾dence concerning the (i) clinical diagnosis classification
and resulting (ii) therapeutic options. This is mainly due
to the paucity of epidemiological data, classification
standards and evidence based treatment recommenda￾tions in DPLD. The majority of reports represent single
cases or small series and not much information is availa￾ble on the incidence and the natural course of these dis￾eases in pediatric patients. This results in the perpetuation
of imprecise diagnoses and non-systematic management
with potential significant therapeutic side effects.
Recently, several attempts have been made to overview
the epidemiology and clinical outcome of children with
DPLD. A national survey in the United Kingdom and Ire￾land collected 46 cases of children with histological
proven idiopathic interstitial pneumonitis over a three
years period [3]. The prevalence for children aged 0-16
years was estimated to be 3.6 cases/million; no numbers
on the incidence were reported. Similarly, the task force
on chronic interstitial lung diseases in immuno-compe￾tent children of the European Respiratory Society reported
on a broad variety of cases. A total of 185 prevalent cases
(107 with biopsy results available) were retrieved across
Europe. Since the number of non-reporting centers
remained unknown, no numbers on the prevalence of
these diseases could be derived [4]. In these recent studies
histology was used alone or, at least to a significant extent,
for disease classification. However, as a comprehensive
classification of the diseases was not available in these
studies, these reports are of limited use for clinical diagno￾sis and treatment of children with DPLD.
Similarly as for the adult idiopathic interstitial pneumo￾nias, when an international group of experts for the clini￾cal, radiographic, and pathologic features agreed upon a
consensus classification in 2002 [5] a novel classification
was proposed by a working group on pediatric DPLD [6].
This classification system was primarily based on lung
biopsy findings derived from 187 cases in children less
than 2 years of age with DPLD collected between July
1999 and July 2004 in eleven children's hospitals in
North America. This classification system represents a
major step forward towards a thorough definition of pedi￾atric cases of DPLD, because it allows a far-reaching cate￾gorization of almost all currently known DPLD entities.
The resulting nomenclature dichotomizes the DPLD dis￾eases into entities mainly prevalent in infants (A) and
entities occurring at all ages (B). Each group contains 4
subgroups, i.e. diffuse developmental disorders (A1),
alveolarization abnormalities (A2), specific conditions of
undefined etiology (A3) and surfactant dysfunction disor￾ders (A4). With respect to those entities occurring at all
ages (B), the subgroups related to systemic diseases (B1),
in immune-intact hosts (B2), in immunocompromised
hosts (B3) and disorders masquerading as DPLD (B4).
The goal of this present study was to assess the incidence,
classification, the clinical management and the outcome
of pediatric DPLD in Germany based on the current DPLD
classification system, supported by an established tool for
epidemiologic studies on rare diseases, the German
ESPED research unit [7].
Methods
The survey was performed with the help of the German
Surveillance Unit for Rare Paediatric Disorders (Erhe￾bungseinheit für seltene pädiatrische Erkrankungen in
Deutschland (ESPED)). This survey unit sends out
monthly postcards or emails to all paediatric hospitals,
usually addressing several responsible persons in each
hospital, who report whether or not DPLD has been diag￾nosed. Between January 1, 2005 and December 31, 2006,
monthly 462 cards and emails were sent out simultane￾ously in Germany. The overall return rate was 97% for
both card and email responses. In case of a positive reply,
a detailed questionnaire was sent to the reporting institu￾tion. The return rate was 70%. In cases of lacking or
incompletely filled out questionnaire, information was
attempted to obtain by phone. The number of children
under 17 years of age under surveillance was 14 393 400.
The case definition included all cases of newly diagnosed
patients with DPLD. These were defined as (i) neonates (>
36 weeks of gestation) with chronic (longer than 6 weeks)
respiratory distress and disease diagnosing findings in
bronchoalveolar lavage, lung biopsy, or identification of
disease causing mutations in the genes for the ABCA3-
transporter, surfactant protein B and C (SP-B, SP-C) and
(ii) all children less than 17 years of age with chronic
(more than 6 weeks) diffuse parenchymal lung disease. In
particular, these disease entities included pulmonary
interstitial glycogenosis, persistent tachypnoea of infancy
(or neuroendocrine cell hyperplasia in infancy), alveolar
proteinosis, chronic pneumonitis of infancy, follicular
bronchitis or broncholitis, desquamative interstitial pneu￾monitis (DIP), lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia (not
due to recognized immune deficiency), non-specific inter￾stitial pneumonitis (NSIP), idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis
of infancy, pulmonary hemosiderosis, sarcoidosis, hyper￾sensitivity pneumonitis and eosinophilic pneumonias.
DPLDs, secondary due to immuno deficiencies, rheuma￾tological or oncological diseases, or a chronic graft-versus-

host-reaction of the lungs following stem cell or solid
organ transplantation, were excluded in this study.
The pseudonymized questionnaire asked for sex, age, age
at diagnosis, other diagnoses, ethnicity, consanguinity,
family history, gestational age at birth and respiratory
problems in the neonatal period, pulmonary signs and
symptoms, loss of weight, results of diagnosing tests
(blood, biopsy, bronchoalveolar lavage, lung function,
genetic tests) and therapy for the diffuse parenchymal
lung disease diagnosed and was approved by the Bavarian
data protection agency. In all cases in which a lung biopsy
was obtained, tissue was investigated by light microscopy,
including PAS, iron and bombesin stain and thereafter by
electron microscopy where indicated.
The detailed information collected was discussed and ver￾ified by an independent steering group consisting of pedi￾atric pulmonologists (MG, AF, TZ), a geneticist (PL), and
a pediatric pathologist (FB). Those cases that met the
inclusion criteria qualified as DPLD. These cases were
included into the study.
The results are reported as individual values. For compar￾ison of categorical variables, the Fisher exact test was used.
A two sided p-value of < 0.05 was considered significant.
Results
Overall characteristics of the patients
The overall response rate was excellent and was 97%. Of
the 56 cases reported, after review by the steering commit￾tee, thirty eight cases were verified as DPLD and included
in the final study population (Tables 1, 2 and 3). The inci￾dence of pediatric DPLD in Germany was calculated as
1.32 (confidence interval 0.92 to 1.81) new cases per 1
million of children per year. The female to male ratio was
1.10. The delay in diagnosis, i.e. the time between initial
symptoms and the final diagnosis was on average 2
months (range 0 to 12 months). About one third of the
cases manifested their disease within the first year of life
(Figure 1). After the first year of life, there was a continu￾ous increase of the proportion of children within a certain
age group. Important hints for a genetic cause of the
DPLD were obtained from the family history on ethnic
background, consanguinity and affection of other family
members; this was positive in 6 of the 12 infants with ini￾tial symptoms during the neonatal period (Tables 4 and
5).
Categorization into the current classification system for 
pediatric DPLD
Although all our cases were collected prospectively in
2005 and 2006 and inclusion was not restricted to
patients with lung biopsy, the nomenclature of pediatric
DPLD proposed in 2007 [6] was taken into account and
all cases were attempted to categorize appropriately
(Tables 1, 2 and 3, Figure 2).
Cases 1 to 21 were categorized into disorders more preva￾lent in infancy (A) (Tables 1 and 2). Patients 1-8 were
clearly grouped into "related to the alveolar surfactant
region" (A4) mainly based on lung biopsy or genetic find￾ings. Patients 9 to 15 had DPLD manifesting in the neona￾tal period and likely involving the alveolar surfactant
region; however definite diagnoses by biopsy were not
obtained in these neonates. However it is possible that
some of these patients might belong to categories A1 to
A3. This could have only been clarified by lung biopsies,
which were unfortunately not done. Similarly, patients 16
to 18 manifested their DPLD in infancy, but were only
clinically defined by symptoms, radiologic, lung function
and bronchoalveolar lavage findings typical for interstitial
lung diseases. There were 3 cases (Patients 19-21) classi￾fied as "specific conditions of undefined etiology" (A3)
and on the basis of biopsy in 2, as neuroendocrine hyper￾plasia of infancy. No cases with the diagnosis "alveolari￾zation abnormalities" (A2) and "diffuse developmental
disorders" (A1) were collected.
Cases 22 to 38 were categorized into disorders occurring
at all ages (B) (Table 3). For the diagnosis of many of these
entities a lung biopsy is not necessary. Indeed a biopsy
was done in 5 cases and the other cases were categorized
correctly with high confidence. Due to broadly exclusion
of cases related to immunodeficiencies and transplanta￾tion (B3) and rheumatological or oncological diseases
(B1), we had only one case "related to systemic diseases",
i.e. biopsy proven sarcoidosis. The majority of subjects fell
into the category "immune-intact hosts" (B2), i.e. were
children with hypersensitivity pneumonitis and lastly
children 36-38 were merely defined by symptoms, radio￾logic, lung function and bronchoalveolar lavage findings
as typical for interstitial lung diseases, but not by lung
biopsy.
Diagnosis of monogenetic diseases
Genetic analysis may diagnose conditions related to the
surfactant system (A4), e.g. as SP-B, SP-C, ABCA3 or
GMCSF-receptor deficiencies or other conditions includ￾ing immuno deficiencies with pulmonary manifestation.
In six of the 15 cases known to be analysed for such genes
aberrations were found, which lead to a definite molecu￾lar diagnosis in cases 1 to 5. Abnormalities were most fre￾quently detected in ABCA3, followed by SP-C (Tables 1
and 2).
Treatment and outcome
10 of the 12 patients with initial symptoms within the
neonatal period were mechanically ventilated; of those
who received exogenous surfactant the response was good

in 60% of the cases (Table 6). In almost all children, sys￾temic steroids were tried initially with a reported response
rate of 90%. Of interest, in only two children with hyper￾sensitivity pneumonitis allergen avoidance instead of ster￾oids, i.e. the recommended treatment, were used (Table
7). Only in a minority of the patients with pediatric DPLD
chloroquine was used (Tables 6 and 7).
Of note, there was additional morbidity from concomi￾tant diagnosis, including gastro-esophageal reflux, failure
to thrive, and some auto-immune disorders which were
treated separately (Tables 1, 2 and 3). Overall survival was
87% until the end of the observation period; however
among infants with initial symptoms in the neonatal
period, immediate survival was only 70% (Table 6).
Role of the German consultation network for rare lung 
diseases
In Germany a working group on rare pediatric lung dis￾eases is established and offers help with the diagnosis and
management of cases (http://www.kids-lung-register.eu,

www.klreg.eu, http://www.ped-pneumology.de). About
45% of all cases reported through the German Surveil￾lance Unit for Rare Paediatric Disorders (ESPED) were
also managed in cooperation with the German consulta￾tion network (Tables 1, 2 and 3). Taken together, definite
diagnoses and categorizations were achieved in 25 (cases
1-8 and 19-35) of the 38 cases, whereas in 13 cases this
was not satisfactory. Of interest, among the latter cases in
none a lung biopsy was done, only 3 were reported from
University hospitals and in only 5 the German consulta￾tion network was involved.
Discussion
This study assessed for the first time systematically the
incidence and disease classification of pediatric DPLD in
Germany, yielding a rate of 1.32 new cases per 1 million
of children per year. Diseases caused by monogenetic
defects most frequently manifested during infancy and in
particular during the neonatal period, whereas those
caused by exogenous factors occurred during later child￾hood and adolescence. The categorisation into a recently
proposed classification system for pediatric DPLD was
feasible, and demonstrated the need for a more thorough
diagnostic effort in a number of cases. Guidance by the
German consultation network for pediatric rare lung dis￾eases facilitated a successful diagnosis and may also help
in the future to improve treatment strategies.
The primary strength of the study is the use of an estab￾lished German epidemiological surveillance system
ESPED [7], which addressed all children's hospitals on a
monthly basis with a very high and representative
response rate. Furthermore, this is the first study to gener￾ate incidence data on the basis of a recent standardized
classification system. The incidence estimate is a mini￾mum since under-ascertainment is likely due to failure to
diagnose DPLD or to report diagnosed cases. In order to
minimize under-diagnosis all participating pediatric hos￾pitals were given clear instructions regarding case defini￾tions and diagnostic procedures before starting the
surveillance. Assessment of potential under-reporting
requires at least one additional reporting source. Unfortu￾nately no such second reporting scheme is available for
DPLD. In other studies underreporting in ESPED varied

between 38 - 76% [7], with higher reporting rates for the
more severe and chronic conditions such as metabolic dis￾eases and diabetes. Among the 21 cases of pediatric DPLD
occurring in infancy and categorized into "disorders more
prevalent in infancy" (A), a satisfying diagnosis was estab￾lished in 11. In 10 cases diagnostic efforts were stopped
prematurely. Similar unresolved cases are less likely to be
reported to the registry, whereas those with a definite
diagnosis are more likely to be reported.
The categorization system applied here is based on a study
that used lung tissue as the starting data point [6]. There￾fore those cases that needed biopsy for diagnosis cannot
be definitely categorized. Other differences are related to
our case definition which excluded premature infants and
children which cleared their disease within six weeks.
Recently the BPOLD registry, a web-based registry for rare
(orphan) pediatric lung diseases in the United Kingdom,
was established. In addition to interstitial lung diseases six
other rare lung conditions were collected [8]. The advan￾tage of the system is a rapid and direct communication
between the involved sites. This may allow addressing the
general problem that many of the pediatric DPLD are ini￾tially diagnosed and treated in regional hospitals, as can
be seen by the rate of 50% of all cases reported in our
study from regional hospitals. A disadvantage is that of
the 15 cases of interstitial lung disease reported over a one
year period only one case was confirmed. It is of impor￾tance to offer assistance in the management of these rare
diseases. This is feasible by advice on genetic testing which
was done in our study in 6 out of the 13 cases not satisfac￾tory diagnosed initially.
The current study clearly showed that pediatric DPLD rep￾resent orphan diseases, which need to be more carefully
addressed by both, clinicians and policymakers, health
regulators and government. This is particularly relevant in
the diseases occurring in infants, as the mortality is high
(Table 6). Appropriate diagnostic classification and cate￾gorization is of great importance for indicating a correct
prognosis and treatment in DPLD. The clinicians respon￾sible have to be very insistent as often expensive genetic
tests or relatively invasive procedures (open lung biopsy),
which they are not familiar with on a routine basis, have
to be performed adequately. Similarly, the right therapeu￾tic measures need to be systematically installed and super￾vised. Such tasks should be done in close cooperation
with or in an experienced centre. Web-based communica￾tion and consultation systems may facilitate the manage￾Table 6: Treatment and outcome - Entities mainly prevalent in infants (A)

ment of these patients. Their implementation will allow
easy access to reference pediatric pathologists, radiologists
and other experts. Lastly, the pseudonymised collection of
rare cases, best in association with bio-banked materials,
and the international integration of national networks,
will allow a more rapid progress for patients with these
cumbersome illnesses.
The knowledge of a causal mutation and, if sufficient
numbers of similar cases are collected, the possibility of a
reliable prediction of response to therapy and the progno￾sis, are important from an individual perspective, as
uncertainty causes significant stress and anxiety for many
patients and their families [9]. For instance in patient 1,
bearing lethal SP-B mutations where therapeutic interven￾tions like steroids or whole lung lavages are known to be
ineffective [10], unnecessary treatments can be avoided.
Among the mutations in genes leading to pediatric DPLD
related to the alveolar surfactant region, ABCA3 muta￾tions were the most frequent ones (Table 1). Based on
these data and those obtained previously [11-13], the
diagnostic workup of neonates and infants with suspected
DPLD, a non-resolving course and exclusion of other
causes, should include initial genetic testing for SFTPB
and SFTPC as these are rather small genes, followed by
analysis of the large ABCA3 gene. If genetic testing
remains negative, lung biopsy is the next consequent step.
In older children lung biopsy may be done prior to the
genetic tests, since by this strategy several other entities
which cannot be diagnosed genetically yet, might be diag￾nosed. We found that all ABCA3 mutations identified
were different from each other and not described previ￾ously; they will be the topic of a separate future report.
Conclusions
We present the incident cases of pediatric DPLD in Ger￾many over a two year period and demonstrate that partic￾ularly those cases which were assessed with the help of the
German consultation network for pediatric rare lung dis￾eases, could definitely be diagnosed and categorized into
an advanced classification system. We suggest that system￾atic surveys, disease classification and clinical manage￾ment systems represent a critical prerequisite for future
improvements of treatment and prognosis in the rare chil￾dren with DPLD.
