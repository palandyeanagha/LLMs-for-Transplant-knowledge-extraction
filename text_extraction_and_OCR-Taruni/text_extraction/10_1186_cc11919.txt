Abstract
Introduction: Small-study effects refer to the fact that trials with limited sample sizes are more likely to report
larger beneficial effects than large trials. However, this has never been investigated in critical care medicine. Thus,
the present study aimed to examine the presence and extent of small-study effects in critical care medicine.
Methods: Critical care meta-analyses involving randomized controlled trials and reported mortality as an outcome
measure were considered eligible for the study. Component trials were classified as large (≥100 patients per arm)
and small (<100 patients per arm) according to their sample sizes. Ratio of odds ratio (ROR) was calculated for
each meta-analysis and then RORs were combined using a meta-analytic approach. ROR<1 indicated larger
beneficial effect in small trials. Small and large trials were compared in methodological qualities including
sequence generating, blinding, allocation concealment, intention to treat and sample size calculation.
Results: A total of 27 critical care meta-analyses involving 317 trials were included. Of them, five meta-analyses
showed statistically significant RORs <1, and other meta-analyses did not reach a statistical significance. Overall, the
pooled ROR was 0.60 (95% CI: 0.53 to 0.68); the heterogeneity was moderate with an I2 of 50.3% (chi-squared =
52.30; P = 0.002). Large trials showed significantly better reporting quality than small trials in terms of sequence
generating, allocation concealment, blinding, intention to treat, sample size calculation and incomplete follow-up
data.
Conclusions: Small trials are more likely to report larger beneficial effects than large trials in critical care medicine,
which could be partly explained by the lower methodological quality in small trials. Caution should be practiced in
the interpretation of meta-analyses involving small trials.
Introduction
Small-study effects refer to the pattern that small studies
are more likely to report beneficial effect in the interven￾tion arm, which was first described by Sterne et al. [1].
This effect can be explained, at least partly, by the combi￾nation of lower methodological quality of small studies
and publication bias [2,3]. Typically, such small-study
effects can be evaluated by funnel plot. Funnel plot
depicts the effect size against the precision of the effect
size. Small studies with effect sizes of wider standard
deviations should widely and symmetrically distribute at
the bottom of the plot, and large studies should cluster at
top of the plot, making it the shape of an inverted funnel
plot. If a funnel plot appears asymmetrical, publication
bias is assumed to be present.
In critical care medicine, studies are conducted in inten￾sive care units (ICU) where the number of beds is limited.
Due to the nature of population and the care setting, the
studies in critical care frequently have a small sample size.
Meta-analysis is considered to be an important tool to
combine the effect sizes of small trials, allowing more sta￾tistical power to detect the beneficial effects of a new
intervention. However, according to meta-epidemiological
studies conducted in other biomedical fields, interpreta￾tion of meta-analyses of small trials should be cautious,
and such meta-analyses may overestimate the true effect
of an intervention [3,4]. Small-study effect has been
observed when examining meta-analysis with binary [3]

and continuous outcomes [4]. In critical care medicine,
small-study effects have never been quantitatively assessed.
Thus, we conducted this systematic review of critical care
meta-analyses in an attempt to examine the presence and
extent of small-study effects in critical care medicine.
Materials and methods
Search strategy and study selection
Medline and Embase databases were searched from
inception to August 2012. There was no language
restriction. The core search terms consisted of critical
care, mortality and meta-analysis (detailed search strat￾egy is shown in Additional file 1). Inclusion criteria
were as follows: critical care meta-analyses involving
randomized controlled trial; the end points should
include mortality; at least one component trial had
more than 100 subjects per arm on average. Exclusion
criteria were systematic reviews without meta-analysis;
all component trials were exclusively large (sample sizes
≥100 per arm) or small trials (sample sizes <100 per
arm); meta-analyses included duplicated component
trials. If there were several meta-analyses addressing the
same clinical issue, we included the most updated one.
Two reviewers (XX and ZZ) independently assessed the
literature and disagreement was settled by a third opi￾nion (HN).
Data extraction
The following data were extracted from eligible meta￾analyses: the lead author of the study, year of publication,
number of trials, treatment strategy in the experimental
arm, proportion of large trials in each meta-analysis,
effect size and corresponding 95% confidence interval
(CI), heterogeneity as represented by I2
. For each compo￾nent trial, we extracted the following data: sequence gen￾erating, allocation concealment, blinding, incomplete
follow-up data, intention-to-treat analysis, sample size
calculation, and year of publication. Sequence generating
was considered adequate when the trial reported the
method to generate the randomization sequence (for
example computer, randomization table). Allocation con￾cealment was considered adequate when the investigator
responsible for patient selection was unable to predict
allocation of the next patient. The commonly used tech￾niques included the use of central randomization or
sequentially numbered, opaque and sealed envelopes.
Blinding was considered adequate if the experimental
and control interventions were described as indistin￾guishable by patients or investigators [5].
Small and large trials were distinguished by a cutoff of
an average of 100 subjects per arm. For example, if a
two-arm trial had 113 patients in one arm and 87
patients in the other, it was considered a large trial.
This definition was somewhat arbitrary. However, a
sample size of 200 patients allowed an 80% statistical
power to detect an absolute difference of 20% for binary
outcomes (assuming that the proportion in the control
group was 50%) at two-sided a = 0.05. Another reason
for this definition was that critical care trials were
usually small, and a greater cutoff point would signifi￾cantly reduce the number of meta-analyses that were
eligible for the analysis.
Statistical analysis
Treatment effects were expressed as odds ratio (OR) for
mortality. The number of events and total number of
patients in each arm were extracted for each component
trial. An OR <1 indicated beneficial effect in the experi￾mental arm. A standard logistic regression model was
used to examine whether estimated treatment effects dif￾fer according to whether a trial is large or small [6,7].
Ratio of OR (ROR) was estimated from the regression
model. ROR <1 indicates larger effect size in smaller stu￾dies and ROR >1 indicates larger effect size in large trials.
ROR was calculated separately for each meta-analysis.
These RORs were then combined using a meta-analytic
approach. Inverse variance weighting and either fixed
effect or random effects models were used to pool these
RORs. Meta-analyses involving exclusively large or small
trials were not included in our analysis and thus did not
contribute to the analysis. Heterogeneity between trials
was estimated using I2
. A rough guide to the interpreta￾tion of I2 can be as follows: 0 to 40% represents unimpor￾tant heterogeneity; 30% to 60% represents moderate
heterogeneity; 50% to 90% represents substantial hetero￾geneity and 75% to 100% represents considerable hetero￾geneity [8]. To account for the difference of estimated
effects between large and small trials, the qualities of
study reporting including sequence generating, blinding,
allocation concealment, incomplete follow-up data, sam￾ple size calculation and intention to treat were compared
between large and small trials. The proportions of large
and small trials were compared based on the year of pub￾lication before and after 2002. This was defined arbitra￾rily. However, we feel that multicenter large trials have
increased rapidly in the last 10 years. We analyzed the
association between sample size and treatment effects,
stratified according to the significance of effect size and
heterogeneity within each meta-analysis. All statistical
analyses were performed using Stata software version
11.0 (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX, USA). Statistical
significance was considered at two-sided P <0.05.
Results
Study selection and characteristics
Our initial search identified 371 citations. Of them, 329
were excluded by reviewing the title and abstract
because they were duplicate meta-analyses, included

non-randomized trials, did not report data on mortality,
and other irrelevant articles. Full text of the remaining
42 citations was reviewed, of which 15 citations were
excluded. In these excluded 15 citations, eight did not
include large trials, study end point was not mortality
in four meta-analyses, and three were duplicated meta￾analyses. A total of 27 meta-analyses [9-35] involving
randomized controlled trials were finally included in our
analysis (Figure 1).
Characteristics of included meta-analyses are shown in
Table 1. All meta-analyses were published after the year
2005. These meta-analyses covered all subspecialties of
critical care medicine, including mechanical ventilation,
sedation, fluid resuscitation, prevention of nosocomial
infection, nutrition and critical care nephrology. For the
number of component trials in each meta-analysis, we
only counted those that reported mortality as an end
point. Of note, because one meta-analysis [34] included
seven trials conducted by Joachim Boldt that had been
retracted [36], Boldt’s trials were excluded from analysis.
Eight meta-analyses [10,13,17,18,25,28,31,34] included
only one large trial, and the meta-analyses by Zhongheng
[35] included mostly large trials (83.3%). Most meta￾analyses reported non-significant effect size, and only six
meta-analyses [19,20,22,25,30,31] reported statistically
significant effect sizes (for example mortality). Eight meta￾analyses [12,15,16,20,21,30,32,35] reported high heteroge￾neity and the remaining 19 meta-analyses showed no
significant heterogeneity among component trials. Seven￾teen meta-analyses [9-11,14,17,18,22-29,31,33,34] reported
an I2 of 0%, most of which were meta-analyses without
significant effect sizes.

RORs were estimated by logistic regression model
separately for each meta-analysis (Figure 2). The RORs
and relevant 95% CI are shown in the left column of
Figure 2. Five meta-analyses [12,19-22] showed statisti￾cally significant RORs, indicating significantly larger
beneficial effects in small studies; nine meta-analyses
[10,11,13,15,16,26,27,31,33] showed RORs >1, but with￾out statistical significance; the remaining 13 meta-ana￾lyses showed RORs <1, again without statistical
significance. RORs were combined using a meta-analytic
approach with inverse variance weighting. A fixed effect
model was used to combine the RORs. Overall, the
pooled ROR was 0.60 (95% CI: 0.53 to 0.68); the hetero￾geneity was moderate with an I2 of 50.3% (chi-squared
= 52.30; P = 0.002). Meta-regression was performed to
test whether the observed RORs were dependent on the
quality of meta-analyses. Covariates including conceal￾ment (P = 0.88), blinding (P = 0.82), intention to treat
(P = 0.72), sequence generating (P = 0.48) and sample
size calculation (P = 0.57) cannot explain the heteroge￾neity between meta-analyses.
To explore possible explanations for the difference of
effect sizes between large and small trials, we compared
reporting qualities of large and small trials (Table 2). As
expected, the large trials showed significantly better
reporting quality than small trials. More large trials were
well conducted than small trials in terms of sequence
generating, allocation concealment, blinding, intention to

treat, sample size calculation and incomplete follow-up
data. For instance, 82% of large trials explicitly reported
allocation concealment, while only 51% of small trials
reported this (P <0.001). Intention-to-treat analysis was
used in 83% of the large trials, while only 52% of the
small trials used this analysis (P <0.001). Sample size cal￾culation was performed a priori in 88% of large trials and
only 44% of small trials reported sample size calculation
(P <0.001). Some 75% of large trials were published after
the year 2002, while 52% of small trials were published
after 2002 (P <0.001).
We estimated ROR between large and small trials strati￾fied according to the characteristics of individual meta￾analysis (Table 3). Eight meta-analyses [16,17,19,20,
22,25,30,31] reported significant effect sizes, and the
pooled ROR was 0.49 (95%: 0.38 to 0.60). The remaining
19 meta-analyses reported insignificant effect sizes, and
the pooled ROR was 0.69 (95%: 0.59 to 0.79). Stratified by
heterogeneity, eight meta-analyses [12,15,16,20,21,30,
32,35] reported high heterogeneity, their combined ROR
was 0.46 (95%: 0.36 to 0.55); the remaining 19 meta-ana￾lyses showed a ROR of 0.79 (95% CI: 0.68 to 0.90). The
result indicated that small-study effects were more promi￾nent in meta-analyses of high heterogeneity.
Discussion
This is the first meta-epidemiological study conducted in
the field of critical care medicine to demonstrate smaller
trials may overestimate treatment effect size. In this study,
we included 27 meta-analyses of 317 randomized con￾trolled trials covering all subspecialties of critical care
medicine. The results showed that small trials were more
likely to report larger estimated treatment effects com￾pared with large trials, and this was more prominent in

meta-analyses involving highly heterogeneous component
trials. Furthermore, the small trials were of low quality in
methodology compared with large trials, which may partly
account for the small-study effects.
In a meta-epidemiological study in osteoarthritis [4], the
authors employed the difference in effect sizes between
large and small trials to explore the small-study effects. In
line with the present study, they concluded that small
trials were more likely to report larger beneficial treatment
effects than large trials. However, in that study, the small
trials were not statistically different from those of large
trials in terms of blinding, intention-to-treat analysis, thus,
the small-study effects cannot be fully explained by meth￾odological quality. In osteoarthritis trials blinding is prob￾ably much more easily achieved because drugs can be
made indistinguishable in appearance. Thus, small studies,
usually with limited financial support, can also achieve
good methodological quality. In contrast, in critical care
medicine, blinding is sometimes impossible or complex
due to the nature of intervention. Such interventions
included pulmonary artery catheter, intensity of continu￾ous renal replacement therapy, prone ventilation, and sub￾glottic secretion drainage. In these situations, blinding
may be difficult to achieve or only large trials with more
planning and methodological support can make this possi￾ble. Thus, small trials in critical care medicine are of lim￾ited quality in design compared with large trials.
Possible explanations for the small-study effects have
been explored. Kjaergard and colleagues [3] demonstrated
that small studies with lower quality significantly exagger￾ated the intervention effect compared to large trials, while
small trials with adequate sequence generating, allocation
concealment and blinding did not differ from large trials.
This is consistent with our findings that small studies had
lower methodological quality compared with large trials.
However, the impact of methodological quality such as
allocation concealment and blinding varies according to
different outcomes. A meta-epidemiological study invol￾ving 146 meta-analyses demonstrated that in trials with
subjective outcomes the estimated effect sizes were exag￾gerated when there was inadequate concealment or blind￾ing, while in trials with objective outcomes such as
mortality, there was little evidence that inadequate con￾cealment and lack of blinding would distort the estimated
effect sizes [37]. This is in contrast with our findings,
because we used mortality as an end point, but the result
indicated that lack of blinding and inadequate allocation
concealment might contribute to the exaggerated effect
sizes in small trials. However, this is an unsettled question
and there are other studies supporting our finding [38,39].
Most probably, individual quality measures such as blind￾ing and allocation concealment are not consistently asso￾ciated with the effect sizes across study areas, and each
medical area should be specifically investigated [40]. Our
analysis focused on the field of critical care medicine and
showed, for the first time, a possible association of metho￾dological quality with effect sizes.
There are several limitations in the present study. First,
our study aims to investigate the small-study effect in cri￾tical care medicine. However, critical care is an extremely
heterogeneous subspecialty that involves all varieties of
diseases. Such heterogeneous nature may potentially
impair the quality of the meta-epidemiological study.
Second, the heterogeneity cannot be fully accounted for
in the present analysis. We tried to explore the sources of
heterogeneity by incorporating factors related to the
quality of study design in meta-regression model, but
failed to identify a significant covariate. We propose that
the explainable factors may be those that cannot be read￾ily accessible. Studies with negative results are less likely
to be published than studies with positive results, parti￾cularly if such studies are small in sample size. As a
result, small studies with negative result are less likely to
be accepted into publication. If this is the case, it is not
surprising that small studies are more likely to report
beneficial effect. However, such kind of publication bias
cannot be systematically investigated. Another explana￾tion for the small-study effect may be that more rigorous
implementation of interventions is performed in smaller
studies.
Conclusions
In conclusion, our study included 27 critical care meta￾analyses involving all subspecialties in the field of critical
care medicine. The result showed that small studies
tended to report larger beneficial effects than large trials.
Interpretation of meta-analyses of small trials should be
cautious and sometimes definitive conclusions cannot be
made until a large multicenter trial is conducted.
Key messages
• Interpretation of critical care meta-analyses involving
small studies should be cautious due to the small-study
effects.
• Small-study effects may be attributable to the poor
methodological quality of the small studies.
