Abstract
Introduction High mobility group box nuclear protein 1
(HMGB1) is a DNA nuclear binding protein that has recently
been shown to be an early trigger of sterile inflammation in
animal models of trauma-hemorrhage via the activation of the
Toll-like-receptor 4 (TLR4) and the receptor for the advanced
glycation endproducts (RAGE). However, whether HMGB1 is
released early after trauma hemorrhage in humans and is
associated with the development of an inflammatory response
and coagulopathy is not known and therefore constitutes the
aim of the present study.
Methods One hundred sixty eight patients were studied as part
of a prospective cohort study of severe trauma patients admitted
to a single Level 1 Trauma center. Blood was drawn within 10
minutes of arrival to the emergency room before the
administration of any fluid resuscitation. HMGB1, tumor
necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-6, von Willebrand Factor
(vWF), angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2), Prothrombin time (PT),
prothrombin fragments 1+2 (PF1+2), soluble thrombomodulin
(sTM), protein C (PC), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1),
tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and D-Dimers were
measured using standard techniques. Base deficit was used as
a measure of tissue hypoperfusion. Measurements were
compared to outcome measures obtained from the electronic
medical record and trauma registry.
Results Plasma levels of HMGB1 were increased within 30
minutes after severe trauma in humans and correlated with the
severity of injury, tissue hypoperfusion, early posttraumatic
coagulopathy and hyperfibrinolysis as well with a systemic
inflammatory response and activation of complement. Non￾survivors had significantly higher plasma levels of HMGB1 than
survivors. Finally, patients who later developed organ injury,
(acute lung injury and acute renal failure) had also significantly
higher plasma levels of HMGB1 early after trauma.
Conclusions The results of this study demonstrate for the first
time that HMGB1 is released into the bloodstream early after
severe trauma in humans. The release of HMGB1 requires
severe injury and tissue hypoperfusion, and is associated with
posttraumatic coagulation abnormalities, activation of
complement and severe systemic inflammatory response.

Introduction
Trauma remains the leading cause of mortality for patients
between 1 and 40 years of age and eclipses cancer, heart dis￾ease and HIV/AIDS [1]. Although there remain a large propor￾tion of trauma victims who die early from overwhelming injury,
trauma patients who survive their initial injury do not die from
their injury per se, but from an overwhelming inflammatory dys￾regulation leading to organ dysfunction, nosocomial infection,
and ultimately multiorgan failure [2,3]. The mechanisms that
initiate this sterile inflammatory process are still not completely
understood.
It has been known for several years that severe trauma is asso￾ciated with an early systemic inflammatory response syndrome
(SIRS) followed by a compensatory anti-inflammatory
response syndrome (CARS), although the molecular mecha￾nisms responsible for this altered host defense are not well
understood [3-5]. However, recent studies have provided new
information on the molecular mechanisms that lead to this
early inflammatory response. Complement and alarmins have
been shown to play an important role as endogenous triggers
of trauma-associated inflammation. The complement system
appears to represent one of the key mediators of the innate
immune response after ischemia-reperfusion and trauma [6-8].
Once activated through the Mannose Binding Lechtin path￾way, the activation of complement is amplified via the alterna￾tive pathway [9,10]. Complement plays a critical role as a
chemoattractant for phagocytes and polymorphonuclear leu￾kocytes and recruits these immune cells to the site of injury.
C3a and C5a bind to their receptors on endothelial cells elic￾iting an inflammatory response via the activation of the
Mitogen-activated protein kinases. Finally, the generation of
C5b by cleavage of C5 generates the membrane attack com￾plex that can lyse eukaryotic cells [8,11].
The second class of early proinflammatory mediators is called
alarmins and represents the correlate of pathogen-associated
molecular patterns (PAMPs) for all non-pathogen-derived dan￾ger signals that originate from tissue injury [12,13]. These
include heat shock proteins, annexins, defensins, S100 pro￾tein and high mobility group box nuclear protein 1 (HMGB1).
These alarmins are endogenous molecules capable of activat￾ing innate immune responses as a signal of tissue damage and
cell injury. Among the alarmins, HMGB1 is a DNA nuclear
binding protein that has recently been shown to be involved in
the triggering of sterile inflammation [14]. HMGB1 release has
been described in both necrotic and apoptotic cells as well as
via a non-classical pathway in immune and non-immune cells
[14]. HMGB1 has become the archytypal mediator of cellular
alarm after sterile stress or injury. For example, HMGB1 has
been shown to both stimulate macrophages and endothelial
cells to release TNF-α, IL-1 and IL-6 via the activation of sev￾eral receptors including toll-like-receptor 4 (TLR4) and recep￾tor for the advanced glycation end products (RAGE) [14-16].
Although the extracellular release of HMGB1 has been
reported by several investigators in patients with infection and
sepsis, only one study has described HMGB1 release in
plasma in a small group of patients several hours after trauma
[17]. It has been shown that HMGB1 is released early in the
plasma of animals that undergo hemorrhagic shock and
trauma and functions as one of the key mediators of the sterile
inflammation induced by ischemia-reperfusion injury [18].
However, it is not known whether HMGB1 is also released in
the plasma early after trauma in humans and this open experi￾mental question constitutes the first aim of this study. Further￾more, because HMGB1 has been shown to induce
microvascular thrombosis and endothelial cell activation [19]
and because we have previously described an activation of the
protein C and of the complement pathways that occurs nearly
immediately after trauma [9,20], we also sought to define the
relations between plasma levels of HMGB1, activation of
coagulation and of the protein C system and the release of
other markers of inflammation and endothelial activation early
after trauma. Here, we report an extracellular release of
HMGB1 within 30 minutes after trauma that correlates with
severity of injury, tissue hypoperfusion, activation of the protein
C system and coagulation abnormalities, complement activa￾tion and the release of other biomarkers of endothelial cell acti￾vation after severe trauma in humans.
Materials and methods
The Institutional Review Board of the University of California at
San Francisco approved the research protocol for this pro￾spective cohort study and granted a waiver of consent for the
blood sampling as it was a minimal risk intervention.
Patients
Consecutive major trauma patients admitted to the San Fran￾cisco General Hospital (level one trauma center) were studied.
All adult trauma patients who met criteria for full trauma team
activation were eligible for enrollment. Patients less than 18
years old or transferred from other hospitals were excluded. In
addition, patients with previous coagulation abnormalities
were also excluded from the study.
Sample collection and measurements
The methodology has been described previously in detail [20].
Briefly, a 10 ml sample of blood was drawn in citrated tubes
within 10 minutes of arrival in the emergency department. The
samples were immediately transferred to the central labora￾tory, centrifuged and the plasma extracted and stored at -
80°C. Samples were analyzed at the conclusion of the study
by researchers who were blinded to all patients data. In this
study, we measured HMGB1 (HMGB-1 ELISA kit IBL, Trans￾atlantic LLC, Osceola, WI, USA). These results were com￾pared with IL-6, TNF-α (both from R&D Systems Inc.,
Minneapolis, MN, USA), von Willebrand Factor (vWF) antigen
(Asserachrom vWF, Diagnostica Stago Inc., Parsippany, NJ,
USA), angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2; Quantikine Ang-2 EIA, R&D Sys-

tems Inc., Minneapolis, MN, USA), soluble C5b-9 to assess
the late phase of terminal complement activation (sC5b-9 EIA,
Quidel Corp., San Diego, CA, USA), prothrombin fragments
(PF 1+2; Enzygnost F1+2 EIA, Dade Behring, Germany), sol￾uble thrombomodulin (TM; Asserachrom Thrombomodulin
EIA, Diagnostica Stago Inc., Parsippany, NJ, USA), and plas￾minogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1; Oxford Biochemicals,
Oxford, MI, US). protein C activity, tissue plasminogen activa￾tor (t-PA), and D-Dimers were measured with a Stago Com￾pact (Diagnostica Stago Inc., Parsippany, NJ, USA), All
measurements were performed in accordance with the manu￾facturers' instructions.
Data collection, outcome measures
Data were collected prospectively on patient demographics,
the injury time, mechanism (blunt or penetrating) and severity,
pre-hospital fluid administration, time of arrival in the trauma
room and admission vital signs. The Injury Severity Score (ISS)
was used as a measure of the degree of tissue injury [21]. An
arterial blood gas was drawn at the same time as the research
sample as part of the standard management of major trauma
patients. The base deficit was used as a measure of the
degree of tissue hypoperfusion. Admission base deficit is a
clinically useful early marker of tissue hypoperfusion in trauma
patients and an admission base deficit greater than 6 mmol/l
has previously been identified as being predictive of worse
outcome in trauma patients [22,23].
Outcome measures
Patients were followed until hospital discharge or death. For
mortality analysis, patients surviving to hospital discharge
were assumed to still be alive. Secondary outcome measures
were also recorded for 28-day ventilator-free days, acute lung
injury (American-European consensus conference definition)
[24] and acute renal injury (Acute Dialysis Quality Initiative
consensus conference definition) [25] and blood transfusions
required in the first 24 hours.
Statistical analysis
Data analysis was performed by the investigators. Normal￾quantile plots were used to test for normal distribution. Rela￾tions between quartile of HMGB1 and continuous variables
were tested with the Kruskall-Wallis test followed by a non￾parametric test for trend. Two-group analysis was performed
using the Wilcoxon rank-sum method. Correlation was
assessed by Spearman correlation coefficients. Logistic
regression was used to examine the relationship between mor￾tality and HMGB1 levels. A P ≤ 0.05 was chosen to represent
statistical significance.

receive any vasopressor, colloid or emergency blood prior to
blood sample collection.
Plasma levels of HMBG1 correlate with arterial base 
deficit and ISS score in trauma patients
There is experimental evidence that HMGB1 may be an early
mediator of sterile inflammation induced by hypoxia and
ischemia-reperfusion, although previous experimental and clin￾ical studies have demonstrated its role as a late mediator of
inflammation in sepsis [14]. However, whether plasma levels
of HMGB1 are elevated early after severe trauma in humans is
unknown. Our initial findings indicate that HMGB1 levels
increase with increasing ISS (P < 0.0003 by rank and P <
0.0001 by trend) and base deficit (P = 0.0019 by rank and P
< 0.0001 by trend). There is a strong positive correlation
between HMGB1 and ISS r = 0.41, P < 0.0001), and a similar
positive correlation between HMGB1 levels measured 30 min￾utes after severe trauma and base deficit (r = 0.35, P =
0.0003; Figures 1a and 1b). Interestingly there was a higher
HMGB1 level in blunt trauma patients (11.70 ± 18.3) vs pen￾etrating trauma victims (5.06 ± 8.6 P = 0.02).
Plasma levels of HMBG1 and early systemic 
inflammatory response in trauma patients
Previous studies have shown that HMGB1 can cause the
release of inflammatory mediators by several cell types includ￾ing endothelial cells via the activation of TLR4 and RAGE. We
thus determined the relationship between plasma levels of
HMGB1 and inflammatory mediators early after trauma. Again,
here HMGB1 levels increase with increasing levels of and
early proinflammatory mediators such as IL-6 (P = 0.0001 by
rank and P < 0.0001 by trend, Spearman correlation r = 0.36,
P < 0.0001) and TNF-α (P = 0.03 by rank 0.004 by trend,
Spearman correlation r = 0.25, P = 0.0013; Figures 2a and
2b). Ang-2 is stored in the same endothelial cell organelles as
vWF (Weibel Palade bodies) and released in part by the same
mechanism upon endothelial stimulation, such as hypoxia and
ischemia-reperfusion associated with severe trauma [26]. We
thus examined whether plasma levels of these markers of
endothelial cell activation would correlate with those of
HMGB1 early after trauma. We found HMGB1 increased with
increasing plasma levels of vWF (P = 0.05 by both rank and
trend, Spearman correlation r = 0.18, P = 0.02) and Ang-2 (P
= 0.09 by rank but 0.01 by trend, Spearman correlation r =
0.23, P = 0.02; Figures 2c and 2d).
Recent experimental studies have indicated that alarmins, a
family of early danger signal mediators to which HMGB1
belongs, and complement appear to be the early mediators of
the sterile inflammatory response associated with hemor￾rhagic shock [14]. Furthermore, a recent experimental study
has suggested that complement can activate the release of
HMGB1 [27]. Finally, we have previously reported that there is
an activation of complement within 45 minutes after severe
trauma in humans [9]. We thus determined whether there was
a correlation between activation of complement and plasma
levels of HMGB1 within 45 minutes after trauma. The results
indicate that trauma patients who had the higher plasma levels
of HMGB1 had significantly higher plasma levels of C5b-9
(membrane attack complex) generated as the final common
pathway of complement activation (P = 0.0001 by rank and
trend, Spearman correlation r = 0.33, P = 0.0001; Figure 2e).
Plasma levels of HMBG1 and early coagulation 
derangements in trauma patients
Coagulation abnormalities are common following major
trauma and are directly related to worse clinical outcome [28].
We have recently shown that only patients who are severely
injured and in shock are coagulopathic at the admission to the
Emergency Department within 45 minutes after injury and that
the development of this coagulopathy correlates with the acti￾Figure 1

vation of the protein C pathway rather than with the consump￾tion of coagulation factors [20]. We next sought to identify
whether the release of HMGB1 in our patients was related to
coagulation abnormalities. Patients with clinically significant
coagulation abnormalities (international nationalized ratio
(INR) >1.5) had significantly higher plasma levels of HMGB1
(P = 0.01; Figure 3a). Furthermore, increasing plasma levels
of HMGB1 were associated with a rise in INR (Spearman cor￾relation r = 0.20, P = 0.008) the levels of soluble PF 1+2, a
marker of thrombin generation (P = 0.001 by rank and P <
0.0001 by trend Spearman correlation r = 0.53 P ≤ 0.0001),
soluble thrombomodulin (P = 0.06 by rank and P = 0.02 by
trend, Spearman correlation r = 0.24 P = 0.002) and a fall in
protein C levels (P = 0.002 by rank and trend Spearman cor￾relation -.39, P ≤ 0.0001; Figures 3b to 3d). Finally, plasma
levels of HMGB1 were negatively correlated with those of PAI￾1 (P = 0.04 by rank and P = 0.03 by trend, Spearman corre￾lation r = -.23, P = 0.004), and positively correlated with t-PA
(P = 0.0001 by rank and trend, Spearman correlation r = 0.46,
P ≤ 0.0001 and D-Dimer levels (P = 0.001 by rank and trend,
Spearman correlation r = 0.50, P ≤ 0.0001; Figures 4a to 4c),
suggesting an increased fibrinolytic activity in patients with
elevated plasma levels of HMGB1.
Plasma levels of HMGB1 and clinical outcome in trauma 
patients
Finally, to determine the clinical significance of these findings,
we examined whether HMGB1 release into the bloodstream

within 30 minutes after injury was associated with worse clini￾cal outcome. We found that there was a direct relation
between mortality rate and plasma levels of HMGB1. A dou￾bling of HMGB1 levels was associated with a 1.7 times likeli￾hood of death (odds ratio 1.70; 95% confidence interval 1.12
to 2.60; P = 0.01; Figures 5a to 5b). Non-survivors (n = 26)
had significantly higher than plasma levels of HMGB1 than
survivors (n = 183; Figures 5a and 5b). Furthermore, patients
who later developed organ injury, such as acute lung injury (n
= 18) and acute renal failure (n = 23). had also significantly
higher plasma levels of HMGB1 measured immediately after
admission to the Emergency Department within 45 minutes
after injury (Figure 5c).
Discussion
The results of this study demonstrate for the first time that: (a)
HMGB1, a known early mediator of sterile inflammation, is
released in the plasma within 45 minutes after severe trauma
in humans; (b) the release of HMGB1 in the plasma requires
severe tissue injury and tissue hypoperfusion; and (c) HMGB1
is associated with posttraumatic coagulation abnormalities,
activation of complement and severe systemic inflammatory
response.
Severe trauma is associated with an early SIRS seen within 30
to 60 minutes after injury followed by a CARS observed 24 to
48 hours after injury, although the molecular mechanisms
responsible for this altered host defense are not well under￾stood [2-4]. Recent studies have provided new information on
the molecular mechanisms that lead to the early inflammatory
response. Complement and alarmins have been shown in
experimental studies to play an important role as endogenous
triggers of trauma-associated inflammation. Among the alarm￾ins, HMGB1 appears to be one of the important mediators in
triggering this posttraumatic sterile inflammation via receptors,
such as TLR4 and RAGE [12-14,29] (Figure 6). However,
whether HMGB1 is an early mediator of the early inflammatory
response induced by severe trauma in humans is unknown.
Only one previous study had described HMGB1 release in
plasma in a small group of patients several hours after trauma
[17]. We present here for the first time evidence that HMGB1
is released within 30 minutes after trauma in patients with
severe injury and tissue hypoperfusion. There was no signifi￾cant fluid resuscitation or other potentially confounding treat￾ment prior to blood sampling and therefore our findings
represent the direct effects of the injury and shock on the
release of HMGB1 into the bloodstream.

Initial interest in HMGB1 as a biomarker of inflammation came
from the work of Tracey and colleagues [17] who showed that
HMGB1 was released in response to lipopolysaccharide
(LPS) in mice. Significantly HMGB1 was released at a later
time point (peak at 16 hours) as compared with the nearly
immediate release of TNF-α and IL-1β after exposure to LPS.
These findings were extended by the same research group
who showed that HMGB1 is a factor of lethality in mice ren￾dered septic by the induction of a polymicrobial bacterial peri￾tonitis. Further studies reported that HMGB1 could induce the
release of proinflammatory cytokines and induce an increase
in permeability across intestinal cell monolayers [14]. The
interest for this late release of HMGB1 after exposure to LPS
was related to the fact that an anti-HMGB1 blocking antibody
could rescue mice from lethality after cecal ligation and punc￾ture as late as 24 hours after the beginning of sepsis [30,31].
In humans, plasma levels of HMGB1 have been shown to be
elevated in ICU patients with sepsis and patients after major
surgery (esophagectomy) [32]. Both Wang and colleagues
and Sunden-Cullberg and colleagues reported a prolonged
elevation of plasma levels of HMGB1 in septic patients
[33,34]. Interestingly in these studies, there was no correlation
between elevation in HMGB1 levels and severity of infection.
In a more recent study, Gibot and colleagues reported that
plasma levels of HMGB1 measured at day three after onset of
severe sepsis discriminated survivors from non-survivors [35].
Taken together, these results indicate that HMGB1 is a late
mediator of sepsis that has an important mechanistic role in
that disease, because the inhibition of HMGB1 activity signifi￾cantly ameliorates the survival in experimental animal models
of septic shock.
In contrast to the data reported for sepsis, we found a signifi￾cant difference in plasma levels of HMGB1 between survivors
and non-survivors from severe trauma. This major difference in
the plasma level profile of HMGB1 between septic and hem￾orrhagic shock may be explained by the fact that experimental
studies have shown that HMGB1 is one of the alarmins, pro￾teins that play a critical role in initiating the sterile inflammatory
response after onset of ischemia-reperfusion injury [16]. The
results of these experimental studies are supported by the cor￾relation we found between plasma levels of HMGB1 and sev￾eral inflammatory mediators, such as IL-6 and TNF-α, as well
as markers of endothelial cell activation, such as Ang-2 and
vWF antigen. Taken together, previous studies and our results
indicate different kinetics for the release of HMGB1 during the
two major causes of shock: sepsis and hemorrhage. HMGB1
appears to be an early mediator of the sterile inflammation

induced by trauma-hemorrhage; in contrast, the kinetics of
HMGB1 release due to sepsis may differ depending on the
primary source of infection [34].
The second important result of our study is the relation
between the plasma levels of HMGB1 and the activation of the
protein C pathway that we have previously shown to be
induced by tissue injury and hypoperfusion. This relation is par￾ticularly interesting in light of the recent discovery that
HMGB1 binds in vitro to the lectin domain of TM. Abeyama
and colleagues reported that TM could bind HMGB1 and
serves thus as a sink for active HMGB1 in the plasma [36].
These results add to the concept that TM is an anti-inflamma￾tory protein via its sequestration of thrombin, and its activation
of protein C and Thrombin activated fibrinogen inhibitor
(TAFI)[29]. Whether TM after binding HMGB1 would still
maintain its ability to activate protein C is unclear, although
protein C activation is dependent on the Gla domain of TM
while HMGB1 is bound to its lectin domain. Ito and colleagues
recently reported that administration of HMGB1 caused fibrin
deposition and prolonged clotting times in healthy rats [19].
These investigators also showed that HMGB1-bound TM and
thereby reduced the ability of thrombomodulin to activate pro￾tein C in vitro. In contrast to the results of these experimental
studies, our current data show a simultaneous release of
HMGB1 in the plasma and an activation of the protein C path￾way by tissue injury and hypoperfusion suggesting that the
release of HMGB1 in the plasma is not sufficient to inhibit the
activation of the protein C pathway and the development of
coagulopathy within 45 minutes after severe trauma-hemor￾rhage. However, these clinical results do not exclude that, in
addition to the cytokine-like effect of HMGB1 via the TLR4 and
RAGE receptors, extracellular HMGB1 could also attenuate
the maladaptive activation of the protein C observed after
severe trauma. Additional studies with a mouse model of

High plasma levels of HMGB1 are associated with increased mortality and ciated with increased mortality and end-organ injury in d-organ injury in trauma patients. trauma patients (a) Baseline plasma levels of high 
mobility group box nuclear protein 1 (HMGB1) after severe trauma were higher in non-survivors compared with survivors. Graphs depict median and 
interquartile range; P = 0.02 by Wilcoxon rank-sum). (b) Patients who developed acute lung injury (ALI) had significantly higher levels of plasma 
HMGB1 compared with those who did not develop ALI (median 7.49 vs 4.28 ng/ml, P = 0.02). Likewise, patients with fewer ventilator free days 
(VFDs) had higher plasma HMGB1 levels compared with those with more VFDs (P = 0.0004). Patients who developed acute renal failure (ARF) had 
significantly higher plasma HMGB1 levels compared with those who did not develop ARF (median 12.76 vs. 4.14 ng/ml, P = 0.0001). Patients who 
required more than two units of packed red cell transfusion also had higher plasma HMGB1 levels compared with those transfused with fewer units 
of blood (P = 0.03). Graphs depict median and interquartile range.

HMGB1 after severe trauma and are currently being per￾formed in our laboratory.
Conclusions
In summary, the results of the present study indicate that
HMGB1, a known early mediator of sterile inflammation, is
released within 30 minutes after trauma in humans. Plasma
levels of HMGB1 correlate with the severity of injury, tissue
hypoperfusion, early posttraumatic coagulopathy and hyperfi￾brinolysis as well with a systemic inflammatory response and
activation of complement. Patients who did not survive their
injuries had significantly higher plasma levels of HMGB1 early
after trauma than those who did. Future studies will be needed
to determine whether the inhibition of HMGB1 early after
trauma may significantly reduce the systemic inflammatory
response associated with tissue injury and hypoperfusion.

Key messages
• HMGB1 is elevated in plasma early after injury and 
shock in human patients.
• Plasma levels of HMGB1 correlate with injury severity 
and shock.
• Plasma levels of HMGB1 correlate with early post-trau￾matic coagulopathy and other markers of systemic 
inflammation.
• Early HMGB1 elevation is associated with increased 
morbidity and mortality in trauma patients.
