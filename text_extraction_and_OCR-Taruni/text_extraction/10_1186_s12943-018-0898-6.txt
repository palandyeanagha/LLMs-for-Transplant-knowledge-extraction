Abstract
Background: Exosomes are extracellular vesicles that mediate cellular communication in health and diseases.
Neutrophils could be polarized to a pro-tumor phenotype by tumor. The function of tumor-derived exosomes in
neutrophil regulation remains unclear.
Methods: We investigated the effects of gastric cancer cell-derived exosomes (GC-Ex) on the pro-tumor activation
of neutrophils and elucidated the underlying mechanisms.
Results: GC-Ex prolonged neutrophil survival and induced expression of inflammatory factors in neutrophils. GC-Ex￾activated neutrophils, in turn, promoted gastric cancer cell migration. GC-Ex transported high mobility group box-1
(HMGB1) that activated NF-κB pathway through interaction with TLR4, resulting in an increased autophagic response in
neutrophils. Blocking HMGB1/TLR4 interaction, NF-κB pathway, and autophagy reversed GC-Ex-induced neutrophil
activation. Silencing HMGB1 in gastric cancer cells confirmed HMGB1 as a key factor for GC-Ex-mediated neutrophil
activation. Furthermore, HMGB1 expression was upregulated in gastric cancer tissues. Increased HMGB1 expression was
associated with poor prognosis in patients with gastric cancer. Finally, gastric cancer tissue-derived exosomes acted
similarly as exosomes derived from gastric cancer cell lines in neutrophil activation.
Conclusion: We demonstrate that gastric cancer cell-derived exosomes induce autophagy and pro-tumor activation of
neutrophils via HMGB1/TLR4/NF-κB signaling, which provides new insights into mechanisms for neutrophil regulation
in cancer and sheds lights on the multifaceted role of exosomes in reshaping tumor microenvironment.

Background
Neutrophils are important players in cancer development
and progression [1–3]. In various cancers, neutrophils
have been shown to promote carcinogenesis, growth and
metastasis, angiogenesis, and immunosuppression. Neu￾trophils produce genotoxic substances such as reactive
oxygen species (ROS) that can damage DNA in epithelial
cells and initiate carcinogenesis. Neutrophils can also gen￾erate a wide spectrum of factors such as neutrophil elas￾tase (NE) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) to promote tumor
cell proliferation [4, 5]. In addition, neutrophils can
promote tumor metastasis by enhancing tumor cell migra￾tion and invasion, degrading extracellular matrix, and pro￾moting tumor cell colonization [6–8]. Meanwhile,
neutrophils impair immunity to help tumor growth and
metastasis [9–12]. Moreover, neutrophils produce a num￾ber of molecules such as matrix metalloproteinase-9
(MMP-9) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)
to induce angiogenesis [13]. Increased neutrophil infiltra￾tion and elevated neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR) have
been linked to disease progression and poor prognosis in
cancer patients [14]. Targeting neutrophils to inhibit their
pro-tumor function has shown therapeutic potential in
mouse models [15]. Thus, better understanding of neutro￾phil regulation in cancer will provide new approaches for
cancer diagnosis and therapy.

Accumulating studies suggest that tumor can induce a
pro-tumor phenotype in neutrophils that, in turn, help
tumor progression. The previous studies have shown
that tumor cells produce oxysterol [16], C-X-C motif
chemokine ligand 5 (CXCL5) [17], hyaluronan fragments
(HA) [18], granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating
factor (GM-CSF) [19], and macrophage migration inhibi￾tory factor (MIF) [20]. These factors induce pro-tumor
activation of neutrophils, leading to increased tumor
growth and metastasis. We have reported that IL-6 de￾rived from tumor-resident mesenchymal stem cells in￾duces neutrophil activation, resulting in enhanced
angiogenesis and tumor metastasis [21]. Recently, Coffelt
et al. demonstrated that IL-17 produced by tumor infil￾trating γ
δ T cells could recruit, expand, and activate neu￾trophils to promote lung metastasis of breast cancer
[22]. Nonetheless, mechanisms for the modulation of
neutrophil phenotype and function in tumor milieu re￾main not fully characterized.
Exosomes are small lipid bilayer membrane vesicles of
endocytic origin. Exosomes, as a novel mechanism of
intercellular communication, can shuttle bioactive mole￾cules from one cell to another, leading to the exchange
of genetic information and reprogramming of recipient
cells. Increasing evidence suggests that tumor cells re￾lease excessive amount of exosomes that promote tumor
growth [23]. In addition, tumor-derived exosomes signal
immune cells in tumor microenvironment, helping
tumor cells escape immune surveillance and form
pre-metastatic niche [24, 25]. We have recently shown
that tumor cells interact with mesenchymal stem cells
via exosomes to promote tumor growth, metastasis, and
drug resistance [26–28]. However, the function of
tumor-derived exosomes in neutrophil activation has not
been well characterized.
In this study, we demonstrated that gastric cancer cells
induced pro-tumor activation of neutrophils via exo￾somes. Gastric cancer cell-derived exosomes carried high
mobility group box-1 (HMGB1) that interacted with
toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) to activate NF-κB and induce
autophagy in neutrophils, which in turn promoted gas￾tric cancer cell migration. Collectively, our findings indi￾cate that exosomes represent a new regulator of
neutrophil activation in gastric cancer.
Results
The conditioned medium from gastric cancer cells
induces autophagy and pro-tumor activation of
neutrophils
To investigate the role of gastric cancer cells in neutro￾phil phenotype and function, we treated neutrophils iso￾lated from human peripheral blood with gastric cancer
cell-derived conditioned medium (GC-CM) for 12 hours.
Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analyses
showed that treatment with GC-CM inhibited the spon￾taneous apoptosis of neutrophils (Fig. 1a). In addition,
GC-CM-treated neutrophils presented an increased ex￾pression of CD11b, an important molecule for neutro￾phil chemotaxis (Fig. 1b). Because tumors can modulate
immune cells to acquire a pro-inflammatory phenotype,
we determined the expression of inflammatory factors
including IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, oncostatin M (OSM), and
TNFα in neutrophils. As shown in Additional file 1: Fig￾ure S1A, the expression of these inflammatory factors
remarkably increased in GC-CM-treated neutrophils
compared to controls. In addition, the expression of
MMP9 and VEGF was also increased in GC-CM-treated
neutrophils (Additional file 1: Figure S1B). GC-CM
treatment inhibited ROS production while had minimal
effect on the maturation state in neutrophils (Additional
file 2: Figure S2A and B). We collected the supernatant
from GC-CM-primed neutrophils and used it as che￾moattracants for cell migration. The results of transwell
migration assay showed that the supernatants from
GC-CM-primed neutrophils promoted gastric cancer
cell migration (Fig. 1c). Furthermore, GC-CM-primed
neutrophils promoted gastric cancer cell proliferation
and endothelial cell tube formation (Additional file 2:
Figure S2C and D).
The promoting role of neutrophils in cancer progression
has been linked to autophagic activation. Thus, we col￾lected GC-CM-treated neutrophils and analyzed for
autophagosomes. The results of transmission electron
microscope (TEM) analyses showed that there were more
autophagosomes in GC-CM-treated neutrophils than con￾trol cells (Fig. 1d). Immunofluorescent staining results
confirmed the increase in the number of LC3-positive
puncta in GC-CM-treated neutrophils compared to con￾trol cells (Fig. 1e). Moreover, western blot results showed
an increase in LC3-II expression, an autophagosomal
marker, in GC-CM-treated neutrophils (Fig. 1f). We then
examined the expression of autophagy related 7 (ATG7)
and Beclin 1 (BECN1) genes, important regulators of
autophagosome formation, for cells treated with GC-CM.
As expected, the increased expression of ATG7 and
BECN1 was observed in GC-CM-treated neutrophils
compared to controls (Fig. 1g). We next treated neutro￾phils with autophagy inhibitors and evaluated their pheno￾typic and functional changes in response to GC-CM
treatment. As shown in Fig. 1h and i, the pre-treatment
with autophagosome formation inhibitor 3-MA, but not
autophagosome degradation inhibitor CQ, remarkably re￾versed the effects of GC-CM on neutrophil survival and
CD11b expression. More importantly, the pre-treatment
with 3-MA inhibited gastric cancer cell migration induced
by GC-CM-primed neutrophils. This effect, however, was
not seen for CQ (Fig. 1j). Taken together, these results
demonstrate that gastric cancer cell-derived conditioned

medium upregulates autophagy-related gene expression
and induces autophagy in neutrophils, leading to pro￾tumor activation of neutrophils.
GC-CM activates NF-κB pathway in neutrophils
To clarify mechanisms for the pro-tumor activation of
neutrophils, we treated neutrophils with GC-CM and
determined the responses of various pathways. GC-CM
treatment increased the expression of phosphorylated
p65 (p-p65), p-STAT3, and p-ERK in neutrophils in a
time-dependent manner (Fig. 2a). We also found that
the expression of p-p38 and p-Akt was modestly in￾creased in GC-CM-treated neutrophils (Additional file 2:
Figure S2E). Notably, NF-κB inhibitor reversed GC-CM￾induced activation of STAT3 and ERK pathways (Fig. 2b).
In consistent with these observations, NF-κB inhibitor

completely blocked GC-CM-induced expression of in￾flammatory factors while only partial inhibition was
noted for STAT3 and ERK inhibitors (Additional file 3:
Figure S3), suggesting a dominant role of NF-κB path￾way. In particular, the pre-treatment of neutrophils with
NF-κB inhibitor reversed GC-CM-induced expression of
LC3-II, supporting that NF-κB pathway is critically in￾volved in GC-CM-induced autophagy in neutrophils
(Fig. 2c). The increased expression of ATG7 and BECN1
in GC-CM-treated neutrophils was also blocked by
NF-κB inhibitor (Fig. 2d). Finally, GC-CM-primed
neutrophil-induced gastric cancer cell migration was
blocked by NF-κB inhibitor (Fig. 2e). These results sug￾gest that gastric cancer cell-derived conditioned medium
induces a pro-tumor phenotype in neutrophils through
activating NF-κB pathway.
Gastric cancer cell-derived exosomes induce autophagy
and pro-tumor activation of neutrophils
Gastric cancer cells can release exosomes to activate
mesenchymal stem cells and macrophages [27, 29]. We
next determined whether or not tumor-derived exo￾somes are involved in the pro-tumor activation of neu￾trophils. We found that the gastric cancer cell-derived
exosomes (GC-Ex) displayed sphere-like morphology
with a diameter ~100 nm and expressed the exosomal
markers CD9 and CD63 (Fig. 3a and b). To determine
the uptake of GC-Ex by neutrophils, GC-Ex was labeled
with membrane-bound fluorescent dye CM-Dil and
added to neutrophil cultures. Imaging flow cytometry re￾sults showed that GC-Ex was efficiently internalized by
neutrophils (Fig. 3c). We next investigated the ability of
GC-Ex to induce autophagy in neutrophils. The results
of TEM and immunofluorescent staining showed that
the number of autophagosomes was increased in
GC-Ex-treated neutrophils compared to control cells
(Fig. 3d and e). GC-Ex treatment also increased LC3-II
expression as well as ATG7 and BECN1 expression in
neutrophils (Fig. 3f and g). Furthermore, GC-Ex pro￾tected neutrophils against spontaneous apoptosis and in￾duced CD11b expression in neutrophils. To demonstrate
which step in the process of autophagy GC-Ex may act

on, we pre-treated neutrophils with autophagosome for￾mation inhibitor 3-MA or autophagosome degradation
inhibitor CQ followed by incubation with GC-Ex. The
effects of GC-Ex on neutrophil apoptosis and CD11b ex￾pression were blocked by 3-MA. In contrast, no effect
was noted for CQ (Fig. 3h and i). Finally, the super￾natant from GC-Ex-treated neutrophils promoted gastric
cancer cell migration. This increase was blocked by 3-MA
but not CQ (Fig. 3j), suggesting that GC-Ex trigger autop￾hagosome formation in neutrophils. Furthermore, GC-Ex
treatment inhibited ROS production while had minimal
effect on the maturation state in neutrophils (Additional
file 4: Figure S4A and B). GC-Ex-primed neutrophils pro￾moted gastric cancer cell proliferation and endothelial cell
tube formation (Additional file 4: Figure S4C and D). The
expression of MMP9 and VEGF was upregulated in
GC-Ex-treated neutrophils (Additional file 4: Figure
S4E). These findings suggest that neutrophils can up￾take GC-Ex to induce autophagy and pro-tumor
activation.
GC-Ex induces neutrophil activation through NF-κB
pathway
Neutrophils were exposed to GC-Ex and the activation
state of various pathways were analyzed. The results of
western blot showed that the expression of p-p65,
p-STAT3, and p-ERK was increased in GC-Ex-treated
neutrophils compared to untreated controls (Fig. 4a).

The expression of phosphorylated p-p38 and p-Akt was
also modestly increased in neutrophils after GC-Ex treat￾ment (Additional file 4: Figure S4E). The pre-treatment
with NF-κB inhibitor blocked GC-Ex-induced activation
of STAT3 and ERK in neutrophils (Fig. 4b). In addition,
NF-κB inhibitor blocked GC-Ex-induced LC3-II produc￾tion as well as ATG7 and BECN1 expression in neutro￾phils (Fig. 4c and d). Similarly, GC-Ex-induced decrease of
spontaneous apoptosis and increase of CD11b in neutro￾phils were reversed by NF-κB inhibitor (Fig. 4e and f).
NF-κB inhibitor also blocked GC-Ex-induced the expres￾sion of inflammatory factors in neutrophils (Fig. 4g).
Moreover, NF-κB inhibitor impaired the migration-pro￾moting effect caused by exposure of gastric cancer cells to
the supernatant from GC-Ex-treated neutrophils (Fig. 4h).
In summary, these results suggest that GC-Ex induces

autophagy and pro-tumor activation of neutrophils
through NF-κB pathway.
GC-Ex induces neutrophil activation through the
interaction between high mobility group box-1 and Toll￾like receptor 4
Exosomes can induce signaling pathway activation in re￾cipient cells by delivering bioactive molecules. To investi￾gate the molecules in GC-Ex that induce neutrophil
activation, we treated GC-Ex with proteinase and evaluated
the effects of digested exosomes on neutrophil activation.
Compared to undigested GC-Ex, the treatment of
proteinase-digested GC-Ex decreased LC3-II expression as
well as ATG7 and BECN1 expression in neutrophils (Add￾itional file 5: Figure S5A and B). In similar, GC-Ex-induced
activation of NF-κB, STAT3, and ERK pathways in neutro￾phils was also impaired by proteinase treatment (Additional
file 5: Figure S5C). Moreover, the treatment with proteinase
decreased GC-Ex-induced expression of inflammatory fac￾tors in neutrophils compared to undigested GC-Ex (Add￾itional file 5: Figure S5D). Thus, we focused on exosomal
proteins in the subsequent studies.
We then tested the roles of exosomes from three other
gastric cancer cell lines. Consistent with that observed in
exosomes from BGC-823 gastric cancer cells, the exo￾somes from HGC-27, MGC-803, and SGC-7901 cells
also induced autophagy and pro-tumor activation in
neutrophils (Additional file 6: Figure S6). To identify
protein(s) that mediate the roles of exosomes in neutro￾phil activation, we performed a proteomic analysis for
exosomes from three gastric cancer cell lines (Additional
file 7: Table S3). Several proteins of interest were identi￾fied such as high mobility group Box-1 (HMGB1),
heat-shock protein 70 (HSP70), fibronectin (FN) (Fig. 5a).
The results of western blot confirmed HMGB1 expres￾sion in GC-Ex from all of the tested gastric cancer cell
lines (Fig. 5b). HMGB1 have previously shown to play
important roles in inflammation and cancer. Thus, we
chose HMGB1 as the target for further study.
We next investigated the role of exosomal HMGB1 in
neutrophil activation. Neutrophils were treated with
HMGB1 antagonist and then exposed to GC-Ex.
HMGB1 antagonist reversed GC-Ex-induced increases
in LC3-II expression and ATG7 and BECN1 expression

in neutrophils compared to GC-Ex alone (Fig. 5c and d).
In addition, GC-Ex-induced apoptotic inhibition as well
as increases of CD11b expression in neutrophils were
inhibited by HMGB1 antagonist (Fig. 5e). Moreover,
HMGB1 antagonist inhibited GC-Ex-induced activation
of NF-κB pathway and expression of inflammatory fac￾tors in neutrophils (Fig. 5f and g). Finally, the promoting
effect of supernatant from GC-Ex-treated neutrophils on
gastric cancer cell migration was impaired by HMGB1
antagonist (Fig. 5h).
HMGB1 activates NF-κB pathway by interacting with
toll-like receptor (TLR) and receptor for advanced glyca￾tion end products (RAGE). We thus examined the ef￾fects of TLR2, TLR4, and RAGE inhibitors on the
observed roles of GC-Ex in neutrophils. As expected,
TLR4 inhibitor blocked GC-Ex-induced autophagy and
NF-κB pathway activation in neutrophils (Fig. 5c, d and
f). TLR4 inhibitor decreased the expression of inflamma￾tory factors in GC-Ex-treated neutrophils and impaired
its gastric cancer cell migration-promoting effect (Fig. 5g
and h; Additional file 5: Figure S5E). However, the inhib￾itors for TLR2 and RAGE showed minimal effects (data
not shown). Taken together, these results suggest that
GC-Ex delivers HMGB1 to neutrophils and induces
pro-tumor activation through TLR4/NF-κB signaling.
Gastric cancer tissue-derived exosomes induce autophagy
and pro-tumor activation of neutrophils
In silico gene expression analysis (Dataset GSE13911
retrieved from Gene Expression Omnibus) showed re￾markably increased HMGB1 expression in gastric cancer
tissues compared to the paired non-cancerous tissues
(Fig. 6a). Therefore, we measured HMGB1 in paired gas￾tric cancer tissues and non-cancerous tissues by ELISA.
The expression of HMGB1 was increased in gastric cancer
tissues compared to non-cancerous tissues (Fig. 6b). To
determine whether increased HMGB1 expression is asso￾ciated with clinical outcomes, HMGB1 was analyzed in
the cancer and non-cancerous tissues from gastric cancer
patients by using tissue microarray. We found that a
higher level of HMGB1 in gastric cancer patients pre￾dicted poorer prognosis (Fig. 6c). In addition, we found
that HMGB1 expression levels were higher in exosomes
from the culture supernatants of gastric cancer tissues
than non-cancerous tissues and in exosomes from the
serum samples of gastric cancer patients than healthy con￾trols (Additional file 8: Figure S7).
To confirm our findings from gastric cancer cell lines, we
tested neutrophil activation by using exosomes from
matched gastric cancer and non-cancerous tissues. Similar
to GC-Ex, exosomes from gastric cancer tissues prevented
the apoptosis of neutrophils and induced CD11b expression
in neutrophils (Fig. 6d and e). Gastric cancer tissue-derived
exosomes also induced higher ATG7 and BECN1
expression (Fig. 6f) and NF-κB activation (Fig. 6g) in neu￾trophils than non-cancerous tissue-derived exosomes. Neu￾trophils treated with exosomes from gastric cancer tissues
promoted gastric cancer cell migration more efficiently
(Fig. 6h). In addition, HMGB1 antagonist reversed gastric
cancer tissue-derived exosomes-induced increases of ATG7
and BECN1 expression in neutrophils (Fig. 6i). Moreover,
gastric cancer tissue-derived exosomes-induced expression
of inflammatory factors in neutrophils was inhibited by
HMGB1 antagonist (Fig. 6j). Finally, the promoting effect of
supernatant from gastric cancer tissue-derived exosomes￾treated neutrophils on gastric cancer cell migration was im￾paired by HMGB1 antagonist (Fig. 6k). Taken together,
these findings indicate that gastric cancer tissue-derived
exosomes could induce autophagy and pro-tumor activa￾tion of neutrophils.
HMGB1 knockdown impairs GC-Ex-induced neutrophil
activation
To clarify the importance of HMGB1 in the pro-tumor
activation of neutrophils, we silenced HMGB1 in gastric
cancer cells by gene-specific siRNA (Fig. 7a) and tested
GC-Ex-induced neutrophil activation. Compared to exo￾somes from cells transfected with scramble control siRNA,
exosomes from HMGB1-silenced cells showed decreased
protection against spontaneous apoptosis and CD11b ex￾pression in neutrophils (Fig. 7b and c). In addition, HMGB1
knockdown decreased GC-Ex-induced LC3-II expression
as well as ATG7 and BECN1 expression in neutrophils
(Fig. 7d and e). Similarly, GC-Ex from HMGB1-silenced
cells had decreased ability to activate NF-κB pathway in
neutrophils compared to control exosomes (Fig. 7f). Fur￾thermore, inflammatory factor expression decreased for
neutrophils that were treated with exosomes from
HMGB1-silenced cancer cells compared to exosomes from
cells transfected with scramble control siRNA (Fig. 7g). Fi￾nally, HMGB1 knockdown blocked the promoting effect of
GC-Ex-activated neutrophils on gastric cancer cell migra￾tion (Fig. 7h). On the contrary, recombinant HMGB1
inhibited spontaneous apoptosis and increased CD11b ex￾pression in neutrophils (Additional file 9: Figure S8A and
B). Recombinant HMGB1-treated neutrophils promoted
the migration of gastric cancer cells and increased the ex￾pression of ATG7 and BECN1 genes in neutrophils (Add￾itional file 9: Figure S8C and D). The expression of MMP9
and VEGF and pro-inflammatory factors was also upregu￾lated in recombinant HMGB1-treated neutrophils (Add￾itional file 9: Figure S8E). These results support HMGB1 as
a key mediator for GC-Ex-induced neutrophil activation.
Discussion
In this study, we reported that gastric cancer cells in￾duced a pro-tumor phenotype in neutrophils via exo￾somes. Gastric cancer cell-derived exosomes induced

autophagy in neutrophils by activating NF-κB pathway
through HMGB1/TLR4 interaction. Activated neutro￾phils, in turn, promoted gastric cancer cell migration in
vitro. Our findings reveal a novel mechanism for
neutrophil modulation in the tumor milieu and provide
new evidence for the important roles of exosomes in
tumor microenvironment.
Inflammation in tumor microenvironment is a hall￾mark of cancer. Immune cells can be modulated by
tumor signals to acquire tumor-promoting phenotype.

The previous studies have shown that neutrophils could
be redirected to a pro-tumor phenotype at the late stage
of tumor progression [11]. The presence of neutrophils in
tumors is considered as an independent and unfavorable
factor for the prognosis of gastric cancer patients [30].
Wu et al. demonstrated that the number of neutrophils
infiltrated in gastric cancer tissues was positively associ￾ated with lymph node metastasis. Furthermore, the super￾natant from gastric cancer cells induced IL-1β and TNFα
expression in neutrophils and prolonged the half-life of
neutrophils [18]. In consistent with this report, we found
that gastric cancer cell-derived conditioned medium
protected neutrophils from spontaneous apoptosis and
induced IL-1β and TNFα expression, among other inflam￾matory factors. Although tumor-derived HA (hyaluronan)
fragments can mediate neutrophil activation [18, 31], we
showed in the current study that gastric cancer cell-de￾rived exosomes could induce neutrophil activation, sug￾gesting that both soluble factors and non-soluble
extracellular vehicles produced by tumor cells could in￾duce neutrophil activation. Moreover, neutrophils acti￾vated by gastric cancer cell-derived exosomes highly
express several inflammatory factors (such as IL-1β and
OSM) that have been previously shown to promote cancer
Fig. 7 HMGB1 knockdown impaired neutrophil activation by gastric cancer cell-derived exosomes. HMGB1 was silenced in gastric cancer cell by
siRNA. Neutrophils were treated with exosomes from HMGB1-silenced (si-HMGB1) and scramble control siRNA (si-Scr) transfected gastric cancer

cell migration and invasion [18, 32], suggesting that the
activated neutrophils may promote gastric cancer metas￾tasis by releasing these factors.
Autophagy, a mechanism for intracellular degradation
and energy recycling, is emerging as an important regu￾lator of immune responses. Autophagy has been linked
to the generation, expansion, and function of neutro￾phils. Autophagy deficiency reduces degranulation in
neutrophils, suggesting the requirement of autophagy
for neutrophil-mediated inflammation [33]. In addition,
autophagy is essential for intracellular bacterial killing by
human neutrophils [34]. Kimmey et al. suggest that
stimulating autophagy in neutrophils increases bacterial
killing but inhibiting autophagy increases bacterial sur￾vival [35], indicating that autophagy is essential for the
function of neutrophils. It has been reported that
granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) activates
autophagy in neutrophils and G-CSF-induced neutrophil
expansion is impaired in the absence of autophagy [36].
More recently, Li et al. suggest that increased autophagy
sustains the pro-tumor effects of neutrophils in human
hepatocellular carcinoma [31]. Interestingly, Dutta et al.
demonstrate that exosomes from breast cancer cells in￾duce autophagy in primary mammary epithelial cells,
which in turn, produce factors to promote breast cancer
cell growth [37]. We found that exosomes from gastric
cancer cells induced autophagy in neutrophils, leading
to the release of factors that promoted the migration
ability of gastric cancer cells. Thus, our results, together
with findings from the others, indicate that tumor-de￾rived exosomes may regulate neutrophil phenotype and
function by inducing autophagic activation.
Interaction of HMGB1 and TLR4 is involved in infec￾tion, tissue injury, and cancer [38]. The previous studies
have shown that UV irradiation-damaged skin cells pro￾duce HMGB1 that recruits and activates neutrophils,
promoting angiogenesis and melanoma metastasis [39].
In addition, tumor cell-derived HMGB1 mediates tumor
cell-platelet interaction to promote metastasis [40].
HMGB1 is shown to be generated in a vesicle form in
monocytes and tumor cells [40, 41]. Activated platelets
present HMGB1 to neutrophils, inducing autophagy and
promoting the formation of neutrophil extracellular
traps [42]. In this study, we found that HMGB1 was
present in GC-Ex. Inhibition of HMGB1/TLR4 inter￾action suppressed GC-Ex-induced pro-tumor activation
of neutrophils, supporting that HMGB1 is a key factor
for the roles of GC-Ex. However, this does not
necessarily exclude other factors in GC-Ex that may
contribute to neutrophil activation. Finally, overexpres￾sion of HMGB1 is reported to be associated with adverse
prognosis in cancer patients [43]. Indeed, we also found
that increased HMGB1 expression in gastric cancer pa￾tients was associated with poor outcomes. Nonetheless,
large cohort studies are warranted to determine the po￾tential of exosomal HMGB1 as a biomarker for gastric
cancer diagnosis and prognosis.
Tumor-derived exosomes can promote tumor growth
by regulating immune cell phenotype and function [44].
For instance, tumor-derived exosomes act on T cells [45,
46], NK cells [12, 47], macrophages [48, 49], dendritic cells
[50], and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) [51]
to induce an immunosuppressive microenvironment. Exo￾somes from ovarian cancer cells polarize macrophages to
an M2 phenotype that, in turn, promotes ovarian cancer
growth and metastasis [52]. Similarly, neutrophils can be
polarized to an N2 phenotype by tumor-derived factors in
murine tumor models [53]. The N2-polarized neutrophils
display pro-metastatic and immunosuppressive activities
[53–55]. Although polarization of neutrophils in human
cancers has not been well characterized, we showed in this
study that exosomes from human gastric cancer cells
induced neutrophils to represent an N2-like phenotype,
supporting a role of tumor-derived exosomes in neutro￾phil polarization.
Neutrophils in the circulation can be divided into high
density neutrophils (HDN) and low density neutrophils
(LDN). In various diseases including cancer, the fre￾quency of LDN increased [56]. Sagiv et al. suggest that
LDN can be induced from HDN by TGF-β stimulation
to promote cancer progression [56]. It should be noted
that in this study, HDN were isolated whereas low dens￾ity neutrophils (LDN) were excluded due to the density
gradient preparation method we used. The effects of
tumor derived exosomes on the phenotype and function
of LDN will be tested in future studies.
Conclusion
In conclusion, we demonstrate in this study that gastric
cancer cell-derived exosomes induce autophagy and pro￾tumor activation in neutrophils through the HMGB1/
TLR4/NF-кB signaling pathway, which finally promotes
the proliferation and migration of gastric cancer cells
(Fig. 7i). These findings provide new insight into the
mechanisms by which neutrophils are regulated in
tumor microenvironment and contribute to tumor
growth and metastasis, and will permit the development
of new strategies for gastric cancer diagnosis, prognosis,
and therapy.
Methods
Patients and biopsy specimens
Fresh tissue specimens were obtained from patients with
GC who underwent surgical resection at the Affiliated
People’s Hospital of Jiangsu University between April
2016 and December 2016. None of these patients had
received chemotherapy or radiotherapy before surgery.
Patients with infectious diseases, autoimmune disease or
Zhang et al. Molecular Cancer (2018) 17:146 Page 11 of 16

multi-primary cancers were excluded. The study was ap￾proved by the ethics committee of Jiangsu University
and informed consent was obtained from all patients.
Cell culture
Human gastric cancer cell lines BGC-823, MGC80-3,
SGC-7901, and HGC-27 were purchased from the Insti￾tute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology at the Chinese
Academy of Sciences (Shanghai, China). Cells were
cultured in low-glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's
medium (DMEM), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum (FBS; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) at 37 o
C in
humidified air with 5% CO2. When cells reached 80%
confluence, medium was replaced with serum-free
medium. Following a 24-hour incubation, medium was
collected, centrifuged to remove cell debris, and stored
at -80 o
C in aliquots as conditioned medium (CM).
Neutrophil isolation and treatment
Peripheral blood was collected from healthy volunteers
after obtaining written informed consent. The study was
approved by the ethics committee of Jiangsu University.
Neutrophils were isolated by using Polymorphprep
(Axis-Shield PoC AS, Norway) as previously described
[21]. RBCs were lysed using hypotonic lysing procedure.
The purity of neutrophils was 98% after this procedure.
Neutrophils were seeded in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) sup￾plemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin
at a density of 1×106 per well and treated with or with￾out CM or exosomes from gastric cancer cells for 12 h.
For experiments that use inhibitors, cells were pretreated
with inhibitors for 1 h prior to adding CM or exosomes.
The inhibitors used in this study include autophagy initi￾ation inhibitor 3-methyladenine (3-MA, 5 mM), autop￾hagosome degradation inhibitor chloroquine (CQ, 20
μM), HMGB1 inhibitor Glycyrrhizin (Gly, 10 μM), TLR4
antagonist TAK-242 (TAK, 10 μM), ERK inhibitor
U0126 (10 μM), NF-κB inhibitor Bay11-7082 (10 μM),
and STAT3 inhibitor WP1066 (10 μM). For HMGB1
treatment, cells were treated with recombinant hu￾man HMGB1 (10 μg/ml; Biovision, Shanghai, China)
for 12 hours.
Exosome isolation
Exosomes were isolated from the conditioned medium
of gastric cancer cells as previously described [29]. In
brief, cells were cultured in exosome-depleted medium
and the supernatants were collected after 48 h. The con￾ditioned medium was centrifuged at 1,000 g for 10 min
to remove cell debris followed by 30 min at 10,000 g
using 100 KDa MWCO before the concentrated solu￾tions were filtrated through a 0.22-μm pore filter (Milli￾pore, Shanghai, China). Exosomes were precipitated by
adding the exosome quick extraction solution (System
Biosciences, Palo Alto, CA, USA) at a ratio of 1:5 at 4
o
C for 12 h. Exosomes were dissolved with PBS and
stored at -80 o
C. Protein concentration was determined
by BCA protein assay kit (ThermoFisher Scientific,
Shanghai, China). The size and concentration of exo￾somes were measured by Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis
(NTA). The morphology of purified exosomes was iden￾tified by transmission electron microscopy (Tecnai 12;
Philips) and the expression of exosomal markers CD9
and CD81 by western blot.
LC-MS/MS
Exosome samples (250 μg) were lysed in STD buffer (4%
SDS, 100 mM Tris/Hcl, and 1 mM dithiothreitol, pH
7.6) and centrifugated at 1000 g for 10 min to collect the
supernatants. Proteins were identified using Q Exactive
Orbitrap LC-MS/MS system (ThermoFisher Scientific).
Tissue microarray
Tissue array was purchased from Shines Pharmaceuticals
(Shanghai, China). A total of 76 pairs of tumor tissues
and non-tumor tissues were included in the tissue array.
Tissue array was incubated with antibody against
HMGB1 (Cell Signaling Technology). Immunohisto￾chemical staining was performed as described elsewhere.
IHC scoring was assessed by two pathologists in a
double-blinded manner.
ELISA
The supernatants from gastric cancer tissues and ad￾jacent non-cancerous tissues were collected for
ELISA. The concentrations of HMGB1 in tissue su￾pernatants were determined by using ELISA kit ac￾cording to the manufacturer’s instructions (Chondrex,
Redmond, WA, USA).
ROS detection assay
Neutrophils treated with or without CM or exosome
from gastric cancer cells for 12 h were collected and re￾suspended in serum-free medium. Cells were stained
with DCFH-DA (10 μM; Beyotime Biotechnology,
Shanghai, China) at 37 o
C for 30 min and subjected to
analyses of florescence intensity by flow cytometry.
Real-time quantitative PCR
Total RNA was extracted from cells using Trizol reagent
(Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 1 μg of RNA was reverse
transcribed to cDNA by using reverse transcriptase
(Vazyme). Real-time quantitative PCR was performed by
using the SYBR Green I real-time detection kit (Cwbio,
Beijing, China) on a Bio-Rad CFX96 Detection System.
The relative gene expression was normalized to β-actin.
The primers for target genes were listed in Additional
file 10: Table S1.

RNA interference
The siRNA against HMGB1 was produced by Genepharrm
(Suzhou, Jiangsu, China). The sequences of HMGB1 siRNA
and the scramble control were shown in Additional file 11:
Table S2. BGC-823 cells (1×105 cells/well) were grown in
6-well plates and transfected with siRNAs by using LipoFiter
transfection reagent (Hanbio, Shanghai, China) for 36 hours.
Western blot
Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer containing proteinase in￾hibitors. Equal amount of proteins was separated by a
12% SDS-PAGE gel. Following electrophoresis, proteins
were transferred to a PVDF membrane, blocked in 5%
non-fat milk, and incubated with primary antibodies at 4
o
C overnight. Antibodies for ERK1/2, p-ERK1/2, NF-кB
p65, p-p65, STAT3, p-STAT3, p-p38, p38, p-Akt, Akt,
LC3, CD9, CD63, Alix, and TSG101 were purchased
from Cell Signaling Technology (Louis Park, MN, USA).
After washing with TBST for three times, membrane
was incubated with HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or
anti-mouse secondary antibodies (Bioworld Technology)
at room temperature for two hours. The protein bands
were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence.
GAPDH served as the loading control.
Cell apoptosis assay
Neutrophil apoptosis was analyzed by using an Annexin V
apoptosis detection kit according to the manufacturer’s in￾structions (Invitrogen). The binding of Annexin V-FITC
and PI to the cells was analyzed on FACS Calibur (BD
Biosciences, NJ, USA) by using Cell Quest software.
Autophagosome detection
For transmission electron microscopic analysis, neutrophils
treated with or without CM or exosome from gastric cancer
cells were washed and fixed in 4% glutaraldehyde, followed
by post-fixation in 2% osmium tetroxide. Thereafter, cells
were dehydrated, treated with propylene oxide, and embed￾ded. The sections were subsequently stained with uranyl
acetate and lead citrate and examined in a Tecnai 12
transmission electron microscopy. For immunofluorescent
staining, neutrophils treated with or without CM or
exosomes were stained with an autophagy detection kit
(Enzo Lifesciences, NY, USA) and analyzed by Cytasion 3 cell
imaging multi-mode reader (BioTek, Shanghai, China).
Transwell migration assay
Cell migration assay was performed in a 24-well Boyden
chamber with an 8-μm pore size polycarbonate membrane
(Corning, Union City, CA, USA). Cancer cells (2×104 in 100
μl of serum-free medium) were added into the upper cham￾ber with 600 μl of supernatant from neutrophils in the lower
chamber. After a 12-h incubation, cancer cells on the upper
surface of the membrane were removed. The migrated cells
on the lower surface of the membrane were fixed by
paraformaldehyde, stained with crystal violet, and counted
under a microscope.
Tube formation assay
Neutrophils were treated with or without CM or exo￾some from gastric cancer cells for 12 h, followed by
washing with PBS once and culturing in fresh medium
for additional 12 h. The supernatant from activated neu￾trophils were collected and filtered through a 0.22 μm
filter. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC)
were seeded at 2×104 cells/well and incubated with or
without conditioned media from neutrophils at 37 o
C
for 12 h. The formation of tube-like structure by
HUVECs were observed under a phase-contrast micro￾scope and photographed at 100× magnification. The
number of tubules from five random fields in each well
was counted. The experiments were repeated for three
times.
CCK8 assay
Gastric cancer cells were seeded at 4×103 cells/well and
incubated with or without supernatant from the acti￾vated neutrophils. CCK8 reagent (10 μl; Vazyme, Nan￾jing, China) was added at 3 hours before the end of the
experiments. The absorption was measured at 450nm in
a microplate reader. The experiments were repeated for
three times.
Tumor tissue-derived conditioned medium and exosomes
Fresh surgically removed gastric cancer tissues and adja￾cent non-cancerous tissues (at least 5 cm distant from
the tumor site) were cut into 1 cm3 and placed in 1 ml
serum-free RPMI 1640 medium for 24 h. The superna￾tants were centrifuged at 300 g for 10 min and filtered
through a 0.22 μm filter and stored at -80 o
C until use.
Neutrophils were cultured in 50% T-CM or N-CM for
12 h. Tumor-derived exosomes were extracted from the
conditioned medium as described in previous section.
Statistical analysis
Data were expressed as means ± SD from at least three
independent experiments. The statistical significance of
differences between groups was determined by two￾tailed Student’s t test. Survival time was analyzed by
Kaplan–Meier method and log-rank test. P<0.05 was
considered statistically significant.
