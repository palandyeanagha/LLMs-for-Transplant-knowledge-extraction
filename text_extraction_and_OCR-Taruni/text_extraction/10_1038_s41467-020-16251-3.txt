There is a limited access to liver transplantation, however, many organs are discarded based
on subjective assessment only. Here we report the VITTAL clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov
number NCT02740608) outcomes, using normothermic machine perfusion (NMP) to
objectively assess livers discarded by all UK centres meeting specific high-risk criteria. Thirty￾one livers were enroled and assessed by viability criteria based on the lactate clearance to
levels ≤2.5 mmol/L within 4 h. The viability was achieved by 22 (71%) organs, that were
transplanted after a median preservation time of 18 h, with 100% 90-day survival. During the
median follow up of 542 days, 4 (18%) patients developed biliary strictures requiring re￾transplantation. This trial demonstrates that viability testing with NMP is feasible and in this
study enabled successful transplantation of 71% of discarded livers, with 100% 90-day
patient and graft survival; it does not seem to prevent non-anastomotic biliary strictures in
livers donated after circulatory death with prolonged warm ischaemia.

L
iver transplantation is a life saving treatment for selected
patients with end-stage liver disease, primary liver cancer
and fulminant hepatic failure. The incidence of liver disease
has risen by 500% over the last 4 decades, however, access to
transplantation is limited by the shortage of donor organs1. As a
consequence, 240 patients (19%) waiting for liver transplantation
in the United Kingdom either died or were removed from the
waiting list in 2016–20172. Data from the United States shows a
similar pattern, comprising 32% of those listed for transplant
(3629 patients) within 3 years of listing2,3. The demand for liver
grafts has driven the wider use of extended criteria donors4.
However, these are associated with an increased risk of primary
non-function or delayed failure5–9, and the acceptance of these
higher-risk organs varies widely10. Because of these inferior
outcomes, and the difficulty of predicting organ viability, many
potential donor organs remain unutilised. The high waiting list
mortality justifies the utilisation of more marginal grafts, but
current practice requires risk mitigation by matching high-risk
livers to lower-risk recipients to achieve patient survival rates that
are acceptable11. Furthermore, the determination of suitability of
a graft for transplantation largely depends on a surgeon’s sub￾jective assessment of the graft’s appearance, using criteria that are
known to be unreliable12.
Organ preservation currently relies upon cooling to ice tem￾perature to reduce cellular metabolism, and infusing specialist
solutions to limit cellular damage. Oxygen deprivation and accu￾mulation of by-products of anaerobic metabolism limit the dura￾tion of storage and result in ischaemia–reperfusion injury at the
time of implantation. This process is more severe in marginal
organs13. Normothermic machine perfusion (NMP) has been
shown to reduce preservation-related graft injury compared to
static cold storage in transplantable livers, according to current
selection criteria, in a prospective European trial, which also
demonstrated increased utilisation of organs14. In NMP, the liver is
supplied with oxygen, nutrients and medication at physiological
temperature and pressures, maintaining conditions that support
homoeostasis, normal metabolic activity and objective assessment
of function in real-time. Experimental data have shown that end￾ischaemic NMP facilitates replenishment of adenosine tripho￾sphate and glycogen levels. Based on increasing clinical experience,
viability criteria have emerged; these are objective parameters,
measurable during NMP15. Whilst the feasibility of this approach
has been demonstrated in a proof-of-concept series, it has not been
validated in a rigorous clinical trial16,17.
We therefore conducted this prospective, non-randomised,
adaptive phase 2 trial in a large single centre, to evaluate the
potential of NMP to provide objective assessment of the viability
of livers currently deemed unsuitable for transplantation, and to
transplant those that met predetermined criteria. The primary
clinical objective underlying this project was the increased and
safe utilisation of livers which are currently discarded.
The trial demonstrates that viability testing with NMP is fea￾sible, and the objective assessment enables successful transplan￾tation of 71% of perfused discarded livers, with 100% 90-day
patient and graft survival. The intervention does not seem to
prevent the development of non-anastomotic biliary strictures in
livers donated after circulatory death (DCD) with prolonged
donor warm ischaemic times.
Results
Characteristics of discarded liver offers and study participants.
Over the 16-month study duration from November 2016 to
February 2018, there were 185 livers discarded for clinical use and
offered for research. Characteristics of those offers and the study
inclusion flowchart are provided in Fig. 1a, b.
One hundred and sixty-four patients on the waiting list were
approached for potential participation, of which 53 were
consented, and 22 were enroled in the study and received rescued
grafts. The potential participants were counselled regarding the
high-risk nature of the project and unknown long-term outcomes
of resuscitated livers. As a consequence, a proportion of patients
were understandably reluctant to participate, and therefore the
lack of suitable consented recipients was the principal rate limiting
factor for inclusion. The number of consented patients at any
given time ranged from 1 to 9; the flow diagram displaying the
progress of patients through the trial is shown in Fig. 2.
Donor liver characteristics and liver biopsy features. In 8 (26%)
donors the liver was the only procured organ. All discarded donor
livers entered in the study satisfied one or more of the inclusion
high-risk criteria. The livers enroled in the trial consisted of 17
organs donated after brainstem death (DBD) and 14 DCD. Many
of these organs looked grossly suboptimal, with some degree of
steatosis, capsular fibrosis or rounded edges with multifactorial
reasons for discard, that was captured by the donor risk index
(DRI) > 2.0 in 22 (71%) livers, with the median DRI 2.2 (1.9–2.9).
Detailed characteristics are shown in Table 1 and Supplementary
Table 1. Photos of all included livers are presented in Fig. 3. The
transplanted livers were typically smaller than non-viable ones
(1.7 vs. 2.0 kg, p = 0.015; Kruskal–Wallis test), with lower peak
pre-mortem donor liver enzyme levels. The median static cold
storage time before starting NMP was 7 h:44 min (6:29–10:25).
Only 3 (10%) livers were included in the trial primarily for
macrosteatosis >30%, (50%, 80% and 60% macrovesicular stea￾tosis combined with 11 h:55 min, 12 h:00 min and 6 h:15 min cold
ischaemia, respectively). Glycogen content and steatosis degree
did not predict the viability assessment results. The detailed
histological finding of each study liver is provided in Supple￾mentary Table 2.
Perfusion parameters assessment. During the NMP procedure
25 livers quickly recovered metabolic activity and cleared lactate
to the target level (details provided in Fig. 4). A biopsy of a
suspicious donor colonic lesion confirmed malignancy, making
one liver unsuitable for transplantation, after meeting the viability
criteria. In three livers, criteria were initially met, however,
metabolic function thereafter deteriorated within the first 4 h,
with increasing lactate. In two cases the transplant procedure was
not commenced and the livers were discarded. In the third, the
explant had begun, and the procedure continued. Overall, 22
(71%) livers met the viability criteria and were transplanted fol￾lowing a median total preservation time of 17 h:53 min
(16:17–21:48; Table 2).
The study patients. The majority (64%) of recipients were men,
and median age was 56 (46–65) years. The leading indication for
transplantation was alcohol-related liver disease (36%), followed
by primary sclerosing cholangitis (27%) and non-alcoholic stea￾tohepatitis (18%). In three (14%) patients the underlying liver
disease was complicated by liver cancer. The median UKELD18
score was 52 (49–55), with a calculated laboratory MELD score of
12 (9–16). Details are provided in Table 2 and Supplementary
Table 3.
Co-primary study outcomes. Thirty-one livers were enroled into
the trial for objective assessment by NMP. Twenty-two of these
livers met the viability criteria and were transplanted, resulting in
a significant successful rescue rate of 71% (22/31, 90% Wilson CI:
56.3–82.2%), to conclude that the procedure is feasible. All 22

(100%) transplanted patients were alive at day 90 post-trans￾plantation—greater than the 18/22 required by the trial design.
Transplant outcomes. Graft 90-day survival was 100%. Seven
(32%) patients developed early allograft dysfunction, and 7 (32%)
patients developed Clavien–Dindo complication grade ≥3,
including 4 (18%) cases with acute kidney injury requiring renal
replacement therapy. The median intensive care and in-hospital
stays were 3.5 days (3–4) and 10 days (8–17), respectively. The 1-
year patient and graft survival were 100% and 86%, respectively.
Details are provided in Table 3.
Vascular and biliary complications. One patient developed an
intra-operative hepatic artery thrombosis after receiving a DBD
graft that had sustained a hepatic arterial injury during procure￾ment. The artery was reconstructed but post-operatively throm￾bosed, undergoing emergency revascularisation which achieved
long-lasting arterial patency. The graft, however, developed biliary
strictures requiring multiple interventions and eventual re￾transplantation.
The per-protocol magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatogra￾phy (MRCP) imaging at 6 months revealed that 2 (9%) patients
developed anastomotic, and 4 (18%) patients non-anastomotic
biliary strictures that presented with cholestatic symptoms. With
the exception of the patient with hepatic artery thrombosis, all
biliary strictures affected recipients of DCD grafts. During the
study median follow up of 542 days (456–641), 4 patients
underwent liver re-transplantation (at day 120, 225, 375 and 417).
The details are provided in Table 3 and Supplementary Table 3.
Comparison of outcomes with contemporary matched con￾trols. Patient and graft survival rates at 12 months (100% and
86%, respectively) were similar to the matched controls (96% and
86%, respectively) as shown in Fig. 5. The incidence of early
allograft dysfunction was higher in the study group (32% vs. 9%,

Fig. 1 Information about discarded livers in the UK between November 2016 and February 2018. a The study livers inclusion flowchart. Over the
16-month study period there were 185 discarded liver research offers, of which 59 (32%) were not eligible for the trial due to an incidental finding of
cancer, macroscopically apparent cirrhosis or advanced fibrosis, severe organ damage or previous machine perfusion. There were 126 livers suitable for the
trial, with steatosis being the leading cause of organ discard with 78 (42%) offers. Stringent donor inclusion criteria were not met in 25 (14%) offers and on
21 (11%) occasions the research team was already committed to the perfusion of another study liver. A liver was considered for the trial only if it could be
allocated to a consented, potential blood group- and size-matched low-risk recipient. Many recipients were apprehensive to participate in such a high-risk
clinical trial, and as a consequence, at any given time there were usually only one to three patients consented. A significant proportion of approached
patients declined to take part, or were transplanted with a standard quality liver before agreeing to take part in this study. Eventually, thirty-one livers were
enroled to the trial, of which 22 (71%) grafts met the viability criteria and were successfully transplanted. b A summary of reasons for livers being
discarded in the United Kingdom between November 2016 and February 2018. A total of 64 livers were discarded for severe steatosis on visual
assessment, with 14 discarded for severe steatosis based on urgent liver biopsy. A percentage of livers were declined due to intra-abdominal or lung
malignancies (e.g. colonic cancer in donor 22). This did not include primary brain tumours or small renal cell cancers which are almost always considered
for donation. The reasons for logistic discard, include the transplant team already being committed to one or more transplantations, lack of a suitable
recipient or too long an anticipated cold ischaemia time due to delays with transportation.

regression). There were no differences in the other assessed
parameters, including the need for post-transplant renal repla￾cement therapy, hospital stay or incidence of Clavien–Dindo
grade ≥ 3 complication rates. The incidence of clinically manifest
non-anastomotic biliary strictures was higher in the study group
(18% vs. 2%, odds ratio 8.0, 95% CI: 0.9–71.6; p = 0.063; condi￾tional logistic regression), although this result needs to be inter￾preted with caution as the matched control patients did not
receive systematic bile duct imaging. Due to the small sample
sizes these comparison results should be interpreted with caution,
and the controls were included to present the study results within
the context of the unit’s contemporary outcomes. The details are
shown in Table 3.
Discussion
Utilisation of livers from organ donors is currently a major
challenge in liver transplantation19. Despite a waiting list mor￾tality in Western countries reaching 20–30%, an increasing pro￾portion of extended criteria livers are unused due to concerns of
primary non-function and early graft dysfunction20,21. The
decision to discard donor livers is still largely based upon donor
history and subjective assessment by the transplanting surgeon.
Standard cold static preservation does not allow for any assess￾ment of liver function, and the only other source of information is
liver histology, which is able to diagnose severe large droplet fatty
change, a well-recognised risk factor for non-function21. This
study has demonstrated that moving from subjective evaluation
to objective testing during NMP might salvage a high proportion
of those livers that are currently discarded. The need to improve
the method by which high-risk livers are assessed was illustrated
in this study by the absence of significant differences in the donor
characteristics between transplanted and discarded livers.
The present trial is the first to systematically investigate
objective viability criteria in livers that met specific high-risk
features in organs initially considered “untransplantable”11,22.
One major challenge addressed in the VITTAL trial design was
that each discarded liver had to also fulfil one or more pre￾defined objective high-risk criteria, as the considerations for liver
transplantability are always multi-factorial, including the reci￾pientʼs condition, logistical aspects and the surgeon’s (or trans￾plant centre’s) experience and risk-taking attitude. The utilisation
of marginal livers in the United Kingdom was facilitated by the
centre-based liver allocation system, allowing the use of high-risk
organs in any patient on the waiting list. All enroled organs were
simultaneously fast-track offered to all UK transplant centres
following the initial decline, and the fact that none of the seven
centres were comfortable using any of the livers included in this
trial confirms that these organs were uniformly perceived to be of
very poor quality. Our team genuinely aimed to push the
boundaries of utilisation of the highest risk organs by accessing

the benefit of rigorous peer-review and continual oversight within
the framework of a clinical trial. We included only organs that
our team did not feel comfortable to use otherwise, and this
attitude was reflected by the 2-tier liver inclusion process
embedded in the trial design, and by the fact that 25 livers, that
would very likely meet the transplantability criteria, were not
considered for study inclusion. Some of the study livers might
have been transplantable if the cold ischaemia was very short and
a suitable recipient was waiting, but currently the majority of
these organs are discarded. With the introduction of the National
Allocation system, logistical constraints exacerbated by static cold
storage are increasingly common and prevent the utilisation of a
rising proportion of marginal livers. In these circumstances, NMP
mitigates the reperfusion process, allowing assessment of the
organ during perfusion without exposing patients to the risk of
primary non-function. In addition, livers discarded due to hae￾modynamic instability (during procurement or during the pro￾cess of brain stem death itself), high liver transaminases or poor
in situ flush, benefited from perfusion in a controlled, near
physiological environment thereby facilitating their recovery. The
potential to recondition the liver in the interval between retrieval
and implantation has hitherto not been possible.
An intervention which increases successful utilisation of high￾risk livers will transform access to transplantation to meet pre￾dicted increasing demand, particularly given trends in donor
demographics and declining organ quality4. Whilst organ

nhs.uk), indicating reluctance of surgeons to accept these organs
for their increasingly sicker recipients. In 2017–2018, not only
were 174 retrieved livers discarded, but 425 livers from solid
organ donors were not even considered suitable for retrieval (11%
of DBD and 52% of DCD); it is reasonable to assume that many
of these would be suitable for testing with NMP. Salvaging a
proportion of these retrieved but discarded organs would add a
good number of transplantable livers annually in the UK, sig￾nificantly reducing waiting list mortality.
International comparisons demonstrate regional variations in
donor demographics and there is evidence that in countries with
higher initial organ acceptance rates there is also a higher discard
rate, particularly for older donors23,24. Viability testing provides
objective evidence of liver function with clearance of metabolic
acidosis, vascular flows, glucose parameters and bile production;
these give the transplant surgeon the confidence to use these
organs safely, and minimises the physical and emotional impact
of non-transplantation for patients.

In the presented study the NMP was commenced following a
median cold storage time reaching 8 h. Whilst this approach may
simplify adoption of the NMP technology without compromising
outcomes in transplantable livers25, recovery of organs from
donors with multiple high-risk features might be further facili￾tated by limiting cold ischaemia through commencing the per￾fusion immediately after procurement in the donor hospital14.
Inevitably there will always be livers that are not suitable for
transplantation, demonstrated by 30% of offers with macroscopic
cirrhosis, biopsy-proven fibrosis or an incidental finding of donor
cancer. A similar proportion of the livers, however, did not meet
any of our high-risk criteria and were therefore considered “too
good” for inclusion. It is reasonable to assume that NMP
assessment would have provided the reassurance needed to justify
transplantation in this group as well.
Improvements in transplant logistics is one of the major
advantages of NMP14,25,26, and the study allowed for the machine
perfusion duration to be between 4 h (time needed for the via￾bility assessment) and 24 h (maximum recommended time by the
perfusion device manufacturer). Once the liver met the viability
criteria we aspired to commence the transplantation as soon as
possible; however, the perfusion was often extended to allow for a
day-time procedure, or to facilitate transplant logistics in the unit.
From our experience, 4–6 h perfusion seems to be sufficient for
adequate assessment and replenishment of the organ’s energy
resources. Due to recirculation of metabolites accumulated in the
organs during cold ischaemia, the high-risk organs probably do
not benefit from prolonged perfusion. The impact of NMP
duration on livers initially exposed to prolonged cold ischaemia is
an area of our ongoing research interest.
Transplant surgeons in many countries are expanding the
donor pool with the use of organs donated after circulatory
death27. In the context of liver transplantation, the longevity of
these organs might be compromised by development of non￾anastomotic biliary strictures8. The incidence of clinically man￾ifest non-anastomotic biliary strictures in the DCD grafts cohort
was 30% (3 out of 10 grafts), higher than the study matched
controls group, but similar to other reported high-risk DCD
series28. In concordance with the European prospective nor￾mothermic preservation trial, our results suggested that MRCP
findings are likely to over-estimate the incidence of biliary com￾plications14. The per-protocol investigation at the 6-month time
point would identify over 80% of the clinically relevant biliary
strictures and asymptomatic irregularities with varying clinical
significance28. The presented findings are accurate, as the images
were correlated with clinical reviews and liver function tests
through the median follow up of 542 (range: 390–784) days.
Nevertheless, it is clear that end-ischaemic NMP does not prevent
the development of non-anastomotic biliary strictures in high￾risk DCD organs, and our outcomes suggest that extending the
donor warm times beyond the currently widely accepted limit of
30 min is not advisable. This finding was not anticipated at the
time of trial design or during the conduct of the trial and only
became evident during the long-term follow up of these grafts
beyond the primary end point of 90 days. Further work is needed
to identify new limits (e.g. donor characteristics, warm ischaemia
time and cold ischaemia time) and to define perfusion biomarkers
that predict this complication and avoid futile transplantation.
Recently published research suggests that the composition of bile
produced during perfusion (pH, bicarbonate and glucose

concentration) is predictive of ischaemic cholangiopathy17. Sub￾analysis of bile samples and determination of biliary endothelial
health is the subject of ongoing research. Evolving novel perfu￾sion strategies might enable the use of DCD grafts exposed to
prolonged warm ischaemia14,29,30.
The other limitations of our study include the sensitivity of the
cut-off lactate value, the non-randomised trial design and exclu￾sion of high-risk transplant recipients. Regarding the former,
following previous experience, we set the lactate viability threshold
to less than 2.5 mmol/L within 2 h of NMP15,16 To maximise
utilisation, this trial extended the assessment period to 4 h. Two
livers in the trial were discarded following a rise of the perfusate
lactate after meeting the 2-h target. The significance of this is
uncertain, although it is notable that a third liver with a similar
pattern of lactate clearance was transplanted and experienced a
substantial period of early allograft dysfunction with a post￾transplant peak ALT of 2074 IU and AST of 3031 IU. Concerning
the design, the trial was conducted as a non-randomised study, as
transplanting discarded livers with an expected high incidence of
primary non-function as controls would be ethically unacceptable.
We expect further advances to be achieved through the identifi￾cation of specific biomarkers that correlate with long-term graft
outcomes, in the context of large NMP series or registries. Lastly,
as we did not want to compound risks, the study did not include
higher risk recipients deemed not suitable to receive marginal
organs at the unit’s multi-disciplinary liver transplant listing
meeting. The majority of participants who decided to participate
did so after a long period waiting on the list, with progressive
deterioration that was not necessarily reflected by their waiting list
position. The feasibility of using livers rescued by NMP for the
high-risk recipient is currently under investigation.
In conclusion, this trial demonstrated that NMP provides a
way of objectively assessing high-risk organs, and allowed
transplantation in a significant proportion of currently unutilised
livers without any incidence of primary non-function. The use of
perfusion technology was associated with increased graft utilisa￾tion, considerably extended preservation time and greatly
improved transplant logistics. Adoption of functional assessment
of high-risk livers can increase access to life saving transplanta￾tion and reduce waiting list mortality.
Methods
Study design. This study was a prospective, open label, phase 2 adaptive single￾arm trial comprising high-risk livers meeting two-tier inclusion criteria. The first￾tier was being considered as unsuitable for transplant by all UK transplant centres
within a nationwide fast-track offering scheme. The trial was performed at a single￾institution (Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Birmingham, UK) with experience in NMP
and utilisation of high-risk grafts5,31. The second-tier eligibility required at least
one of seven specific criteria that confirmed the high-risk status of every enroled
liver (Table 4). To minimise risks of high post-transplant complications or mor￾tality for the study participants, the trial used an adaptive design with two interim
safety analyses (Supplementary Fig. 1). The study design and conduct complied
with all relevant regulations regarding the use of human study participants. The
trial was funded by the Wellcome Trust, and granted approval by the National
Research Ethics Service in London-Dulwich (REC reference 16/LO/1056, Protocol
number RG 15–240) and the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory
Agency and the University Hospitals Birmingham Research and Development
Department. The project was endorsed by the Research, Innovation and Novel
Technologies Advisory Group committee of the National Health Service Blood and
Transplant. The study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (reference number
NCT02740608), the protocol has been published32, and the full version is provided
in the Supplementary Information.
Discarded liver inclusion criteria and the study logistics. The study considered
all potential donors with a diagnosis of brainstem death or Maastricht category III
and IV donors after circulatory death, aged up to 85 years, initially retrieved with
the intent for transplantation but subsequently declined by all UK transplant
centres based on the retrieving or transplant surgeon’s assessment. If our centre
was the last in the fast-track offering sequence, the liver had to be deemed
untransplantable by two consultant surgeons independently. The surgeons were
paired together to create an overall low threshold for using marginal livers,
ensuring any liver that could be used without viability testing was transplanted,
thereby minimising bias. For the liver to be eligible it also had to meet at least one
defined high-risk criterion (see Tables 1 and 4). Consent for research was provided
by the donor’s next of kin.
Study participants. Eligible participants were those listed electively for primary
liver transplantation and deemed to be low-to-moderate transplant risk candidates,
suitable to receive a high-risk graft, as assessed by the unit’s transplant waiting list
multi-disciplinary team. Candidates were required to have a patent portal vein, no
significant comorbidities (cardiovascular diseases, including active angina, a history
of ischaemic heart disease, congestive heart failure, cerebrovascular events, symp￾tomatic valvular heart disease or cardiac arrhythmias; pulmonary conditions
including pulmonary hypertension or established diagnosis of pulmonary dys￾function), a UK end-stage liver disease18 (UKELD) score ≤62 and no history of
major upper abdominal surgery. Each participant was fully informed of being
offered a marginal graft and gave written consent for the trial in advance of the
organ offer, after having at least 24 h to consider their participation.
The study intervention and liver viability assessment. All livers were cold￾preserved with University of Wisconsin solution and commenced NMP using the
OrganOx Metra™ device after arrival at the transplant centre. The protocol stipu￾lated an NMP duration of between 4 and 24 h. Serial perfusate, bile and tissue
samples were taken at regular time intervals. For a liver to be considered viable it
had to metabolise perfusate lactate to levels ≤2.5 mmol/L within 4 h of commen￾cing the perfusion, in addition to meeting at least 2 of the following additional
criteria: evidence of bile production, maintenance of perfusate pH ≥ 7.30, meta￾bolism of glucose, maintenance of stable arterial and portal flows (≥150 and
≥500 mL/min, respectively), and homogenous perfusion with soft consistency of
the parenchyma16.
If a liver was considered viable, the transplant was set up and performed. At the
point of recipient hepatectomy, the NMP team disconnected the organ from the
device, flushed it with 3 l of histidine–tryptophan–ketoglutarate solution at 4 °C
and handed it over for immediate implantation. Post-transplant management
followed the unit’s standard protocol, with immunosuppression comprising
tacrolimus, azathioprine or mycophenolate mofetil and low-dose steroids. Each
patient underwent an MRCP at 6 months unless the investigation was clinically
indicated earlier.
Liver quality was determined retrospectively through histological analysis of
parenchymal biopsies which were assessed for pre-existing liver disease, steatosis,
glycogen content and features of preservation–reperfusion injury.

Fig. 5 Comparison of 1-year graft survival estimate. Conditional logistic
regression was carried out on the matched case–control data to determine
the relative risk for graft survival at 1 year between matched case–control
groups. The median (range) days follow-up data were included in the
survival analyses, but the plot was truncated at 12 months. The ticks on the
top of each Kaplan–Meier curve relate to the numbers of patients being
censored at that particular time point. There are 2 cases of graft failure in
the perfusion group at days 119 and 209; the control group contains 5 graft
failures (2 at day 5, 1 at day 14, 1 at day 165 and 1 at day 182). The graft
survival was similar in both groups. Findings showed that the odds ratio
(relative risk) estimate for graft survival at 6 months was determined as 2.0
(95% CI: 0.2–17.9; p = 0.535). Due to the small sample sizes and that this
statistical comparison test was not powered,these results should be
interpreted with caution.

Outcome measures. The co-primary outcomes consisted of (A) feasibility of NMP
in discarded organ recovery and (B) achievement of successful transplantation. The
perfused organ recovery rate was the proportion of perfusions leading to trans￾plantation. Successful transplantation was defined as 90-day patient survival—a
nationally accepted, monitored and continuously audited outcome measure.
The key secondary outcome measures included assessment of the liver graft
function (by incidence of primary non-function and early allograft dysfunction33)
liver function test results, 90-day graft survival, intensive therapy unit and post￾transplant in-hospital stays, incidence of vascular complications, and anastomotic
and non-anastomotic biliary strictures as assessed by MRCP at 6 months.
Perioperative data collection included haemodynamic stability, incidence of post￾reperfusion syndrome and blood-product requirements. Post-transplant adverse
events and complication severity were graded according to the Clavien–Dindo
classification34. The secondary outcomes were compared with contemporary
controls (1:2), matched in order of priority for the donor graft type, UKELD Score,
donor age and donor sex only. Four variables included in the original protocol
(model of end-stage liver disease [MELD], recipient age, BMI and the liver disease
aetiology) were removed as matching criteria due to confounding correlation and
being overly stringent. No recipient suffered from recurrent disease during the
study follow-up period. The matching criteria used identified 39 patients. There
was consistency in the recipient selection for high-risk grafts guided by the unit’s
protocols and transplant waiting list multi-disciplinary team meetings that assured
similar characteristics regarding the cardiovascular comorbidities and surgical risks
in the study participants and the matched controls. The pre-planned comparisons
with the matched controls group were not powered to demonstrate any differences.
Due to the small sample sizes, these results should be interpreted with caution; the
controls were included to present the study results within the context of the unit’s
contemporary outcomes.
Statistical analysis. The trial was powered with an emphasis on (A) the feasibility
of the intervention using NMP and (B) recipient safety. In terms of the intervention
feasibility (A), the aim was to achieve an organ recovery rate of at least 50%, with a
rate of 30% or less being considered unacceptable. Using a two-stage design35, with
an interim assessment after 24 livers (continuing if ≥8 livers were recovered), a
sample size of up to 53 livers undergoing NMP might be required, with target alpha
(one-sided) of 0.05 (actual alpha = 0.047) and target beta of 0.1 (actual
beta = 0.098). NMP was considered feasible for organ recovery if at least 22 livers
were recovered from 53 perfused. Though the two statistical inferences are asses￾sing different hypotheses (safety and feasibility), they are linked as 22 transplants
are required for the safety testing of the procedure, which is also the minimum
number required out of 53 perfused livers to be considered feasible.
For (B), the mean 90-day patient survival rate for patients receiving liver
transplants in the United Kingdom was 93%36. For the discarded livers, the
desirable and undesirable 90-day overall survival rates were set at 88% and 73%
(15% lower), respectively. Using an optimal three-stage adaptive design37 with two
interim assessments after 3 patients (requires ≥ 2 successes) and 11 patients
(≥8 successes), a sample size of 22 patients was required, with alpha (type I error)
and beta (type II error) of 0.2. As this was an early phase (non-definitive) trial to
assess the safety of this procedure, a relaxed one-sided alpha was used to attain an
achievable sample size within the trial duration and cost constraint. The approach
was considered successful if there were at least 18 successes out of 22 transplants.
The descriptive statistics data were presented as number and percentages, and
median and interquartile range. Due to small numbers, the pre-planned analyses
used Kruskal–Wallis test to assess differences in continuous variables between two
groups and Fisher’s exact test for categorical variables. Kaplan–Meier survival
method was used to analyse time-to-event data and conditional logistic regression
for matched case–control analysis. All secondary and exploratory analyses were
