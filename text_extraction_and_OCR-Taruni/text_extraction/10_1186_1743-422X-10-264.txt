Abstract
Background: Polyomavirus JC (JCV) causes the CNS demyelinating disease progressive multifocal
leukoencephalopathy (PML), which occurs almost exclusively in people with immune deficiencies, such as
HIV-1/AIDS patients. JCV infection is very common and usually occurs early in life. After primary infection,
virus is controlled by the immune system but, rarely when immune function is impaired, it can re-emerge and
multiply in the astrocytes and oligodendrocytes in the brain and cause PML. Thus a central question in PML
pathogenesis is the nature of the molecular mechanisms maintaining JCV in a latent state and then allowing
reactivation.
Methods: Since transcription can be regulated by epigenetic mechanisms including DNA methylation and histone
acetylation, we investigated their role in JCV regulation by employing inhibitors of epigenetic events.
Results: The histone deacetylase inhibitors trichostatin A (TSA) and sodium butyrate powerfully stimulated JCV
early and late transcription while the DNA methylation inhibitor 5-azacytidine had no effect. Analysis of JCV
mutants showed that this effect was mediated by the KB element of the JCV control region, which binds
transcription factors NF-κB p65, NFAT4 and C/EBPβ and mediates stimulation by TNF-α. Stimulation of transcription
by p65 was additive with TSA as was cotransfection with transcriptional coactivators/acetyltransferase p300 whereas
depletion of endogenous p65 by RNA interference inhibited the effect of TSA. EMSA with a KB oligonucleotide
showed p65 expression, TNF-α stimulation or TSA treatment each caused a gel shift that was further shifted by
antibody to p65.
Conclusions: We conclude that JCV is regulated epigenetically by protein acetylation events and that these involve
the NF-κB p65 binding site in the JCV control region.

Background
JC virus (JCV) is a human neurotropic polyomavirus
and is the causative agent of progressive multifocal
leukoencephalopathy, PML, which is a fatal demyelinat￾ing disease of the brain that involves the cytolytic de￾struction of oligodendrocytes by JCV replication. PML
lesions are multiple foci of myelin loss, which cause de￾bilitating neurological symptoms and are areas of de￾myelination in the brain containing oligodendrocytes
with viral nuclear inclusion bodies and bizarre astro￾cytes, which are also productively infected by JCV. The
common underlying feature of PML is a severe weaken￾ing of the immune system, especially HIV-1/AIDS. Even
after the introduction of combination anti-retroviral
therapies (cART), PML still remains a problematic dis￾order associated with HIV-1/AIDS [1]. Despite the rarity
of PML, the high prevalence (66-92%) of antibodies in
human sera against JCV indicates that exposure to the
virus is very common and begins in childhood and con￾tinues into middle age [reviewed in [2]. After the pri￾mary infection virus persists in a latent state and further
sequelae only occur in people with severe immunosup￾pression where viral reactivation leads to PML. Many
important aspects of the JCV life cycle and the patho￾genesis of PML remain unclear including the nature of
the latent state, the mechanisms whereby it is
maintained and the regulation of restoration of viral
transcription/replication when virus reactivates and
causes PML.
JCV is a circular double-stranded DNA virus of the
Polyomaviridae family [3] that was isolated in 1971 from
the brain of a patient with PML [4]. It has two protein

coding regions, which coordinate the viral life cycle: the
early and late coding regions. These are transcribed in
opposite directions starting from the Non-Coding Con￾trol Region (NCCR), which lies between them [5]. The
NCCR functions as the promoter for both the early and
late coding regions and also contains the viral origin of
DNA replication. A variety of cellular transcription fac￾tors, some being glial cell-specific and others ubiquitous,
bind and regulate the NCCR and these cellular factors,
together with the viral early gene product large T￾antigen (T-Ag) facilitate the JCV life cycle [reviewed in
[6]. For example, we have described a site (the KB elem￾ent) that is located on the early side of the origin of rep￾lication and binds the transcription factors NF-κB and
C/EBPβ [7] as well as NFAT4 [8]. Since these transcrip￾tion factors are regulated by signal transduction path￾ways that are controlled by extracellular cytokines, we
have suggested that control of the latency/reactivation of
JCV may be regulated by cytokines acting through the
KB element. We have found that cytokines including
TNF-α and IL-1β stimulate JCV early and late transcrip￾tion and that this is mediated through the KB element
[9].
In addition to the binding of transcription factors, the
expression of genes can be regulated by post-translational
covalent modifications of chromatin itself, which is known
as epigenetic regulation. DNA within the cell nucleus, in￾cluding the circular episomal viral DNA in JCV-infected
cells, is packaged into a dynamic complex of DNA and
histones as well as other non-histone proteins and RNA.
Changes in chromatin structure can regulate the degree of
compactness of chromatin and its availability to the tran￾scriptional machinery, thus modulating transcription of
chromatin in vivo [10,11]. A complex series of regulatory
signals orchestrate the epigenetic status of chromatin in￾cluding DNA methylation and histone acetylation. The as￾sociation of DNA methylation with the silencing of gene
expression is a well-established mechanism of eukaryotic
transcriptional regulation [12]. Methylation of DNA is a
post-replication process whereby cytosine residues in the
dinucleotide sequence 5’-CG-3’ (CpG) are methylated. Ex￾perimentally, DNA methylation can be inhibited by 5-
azacytidine (AZA), which can activate transcription of
genes whose expression is suppressed by methylation.
Typically, eukaryote genes have CpG islands rich in the
CpGs located near the promoter [13]. However, the gen￾ome of JCV (strain Mad-1, [5]) is remarkably lacking in
CpGs and contains only 6 CpGs in the 394 bp NCCR. In
contrast to DNA methylation, histone acetylation is asso￾ciated with transcriptional activation. Dynamic reversible
acetylation of histones is a key part of the transcriptional
process [10,14]. Acetylation of histones is catalyzed by his￾tone acetyltransferase enzymes (HAT) and removal by his￾tone deacetylases (HDAC). Both HAT and HDAC act not
only on histones but also on nonhistone proteins includ￾ing certain transcription factors. Experimentally, HDACs
can be inhibited by trichostatin A (TSA) or sodium butyr￾ate (SB), which can activate gene expression by increasing
histone acetylation.
In this study, we investigate a role for epigenetic modi￾fications in the regulation of Mad-1 JCV. We found that
TSA and SB but not AZA robustly stimulated JCV tran￾scription. This effect was mediated by the JCV NCCR
KB element, was additive with cotransfected NF-κB p65
and was inhibited by p65 siRNA. Thus JCV is regulated
epigenetically by acetylation events involving NF-κB p65
operating at the KB element of the control region.
Results
JCV early and late transcription are inhibited by the
histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) trichostatin A
(TSA) and sodium butyrate (SB) but not by the DNA
methylation inhibitor 5-azacytidine (AZA)
In our first experiments to investigate epigenetic regula￾tion of JCV, TC620 human oligodendroglioma cells were
transfected with luciferase reporter plasmids for the JCV
Mad-1 early (Figure 1A) or late (Figure 1B) promoter and
treated with different concentrations of SB, TSA or AZA.
Figure 1 Effect of the histone deacetylase inhibitors SB and
TSA and the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor AZA on JCV early
and late transcription. TC620 human oligodendroglioma cells were
transfected with the reporter plasmid JCVE-LUC (A) or JCVL-LUC (B)
and treated with inhibitors, harvested and assayed for luciferase
activity as described in Methods. Activities were normalized to
untreated controls. The bar represents one standard deviation.

SB and TSA strongly stimulated (10-30-fold) transcription
of both the early and late promoters while AZA was with￾out effect. Since the reporter plasmids contain regions of
high CpG content from the bacterial vector region and
the luciferase gene, these could potentially become meth￾ylated and interfere with transcription. Thus, we also in￾vestigated transcription in a CpG-free reporter plasmid
background using pCpGL-basic, which completely lacks
CpG dinucleotides and was a kind gift from Michael Rehli,
University Hospital Regensburg, Germany [15] into which
we cloned the Mad-1 JCV NCCR in the early and late ori￾entations to generate pCpGL-JCVE and pCpGL-JCVL, re￾spectively. These constructs gave essentially similar
data (Figure 2A). In an earlier series of studies, we
had generated a series of stable JCV early and late
clonal reporter cell lines derived from TC620 [9]. We
have investigated the effects of the epigenetic reagents
on an early (Figure 2B) and a late (Figure 2C) re￾porter clone and found essentially the same results as
for the transient transfection experiments. Even
treating the early and late integrated reporter cells
with Aza for 3 days, adding fresh inhibitor everyday,
did not induce transcription (Figure 2D and 2E
respectively).
Mapping of the region within the JCV NCCR responsible
for TSA inducibility implicates the KB element
In our earlier studies, we had described a region within
the JCV NCCR, called the KB element that is an import￾ant regulator of JCV early and late transcription, binds the
transcription factors, NF-κB, C/EBPβ and NFAT4, and is
responsible for the transcriptional response to cytokines
such as TNF-α [7-9]. During these studies, we produced a
variety of mutant and wild-type reporter systems to study
JCV early and late transcription. To further analyze the ef￾fect of TSA, we examined two mutants, m1 and m2,
which are base substitution mutants in the KB element of
the JCV early promoter that abrogate the transcriptional
response to NF-κB, NFAT4 and TNF-α [7-9]. As shown
in Figure 3A, wild-type (wt) early promoter responded
as expected but m1 and m2 failed to respond to
TSA. Next, we examined heterologous promoters
where the KB element (wild-type or mutant) was
inserted upstream of the constitutive Herpes simplex
virus thymidine kinase promoter in the CAT reporter
plasmid pBLCAT2 [9]. As shown in Figure 3B, wild￾type but not mutant KB conferred transcriptional in￾ducibility on the promoter in the presence of p65
expression.
NF-κB p65 and TSA cooperate to stimulate JCV early and
late transcription
Since the activity of p65 has been reported to be in￾creased by acetylation [16-19] and the mutational
experiments indicated that the effect of TSA on early
and late transcription may involve the KB element, we
next examined the effect of expressing p65 on the
TSA stimulation of the late promoter. The effect of
TSA and transcription was markedly more pro￾nounced in the presence of p65 (Figure 4A). For

transcription of CpG-free reporter plasmids and on a TC620

cloned into the pCpG reporter plasmid and transfected into TC620
cells, which were then treated with inhibitors (SB – 5, 10 and
15 mM; TSA – 0.2, 0.4 and 1 μM AZA – 10, 15 and 25 μM), harvested
and assayed for luciferase activity as described in Methods. Activities

standard deviation. B. A clonal cell line derived from TC620 by stable

driven by the JCV early promoter [9] was treated with inhibitors
(EtOH – ethanol vehicle control; SB – 5 and 10 μM; AZA – 10 and 15
μM; TSA – 0.5 and 1 μM), harvested and assayed for luciferase
activity. Activities were normalized to untreated controls. The bar
represents one standard deviation. C. As for B except using a stable

inhibitors for three days, adding fresh inhibitor everyday (Aza – 10,
15 and 20 μM; TSA – 0.5 μM). E. As for D except using a stable clone
with the late promoter.

example, at 1 μM TSA transcription was four times
higher in the presence of p65, compare lanes 5 and 8.
Expression of p65 was shown by Western blot (data
not shown). Similar results were obtained with early
promoter (data not shown).
Expression of p300 enhances JCV early and late
transcription
Many transcription factors including p65 recruit the
transcriptional coactivator p300, an acetyltransferase.
p300 binds to p65 and catalyzes histone acetylation to
open chromatin for the transcriptional machinery and
acetylation of p65 itself to increase its activity [18,19].
We found that expression of the JCV early and late
transcription (Figure 4B) and acted cooperatively with
p65 (Figure 4C).
Knockdown of p65 by RNA interference reduces the
stimulation of JCV early and late transcription by TSA
To further investigate a role for TSA in the mediation of
the stimulatory effect of TSA on JCV transcription, we
employed an RNA interference approached with an
siRNA to p65 and a non-targeting (NT) control siRNA
as was have described before [7]. As shown for early
transcription (Figure 5A) and late transcription
(Figure 5B), the stimulatory effect of TSA was partially
reversed by p65 siRNA but not NT siRNA indicating the
involvement of p65 in at least part of the effect of TSA
on JCV transcription. Knockdown of p65 in the p65
siRNA-treated cells was verified by Western blot (shown
inset in each panel).
TSA induces an EMSA gel shift with a KB region
oligonucleotide that co-migrates with that induced by
p65 expression and TNF-α treatment and is supershifted
by antibody to p65
Next, we performed EMSA on nuclear extracts from
cells that had been transfected with expression plasmid
for p65, treated with TSA or stimulated with TNF-α for

30 minutes (Figure 6) and untreated control cell nuclear
extracts. The probe used in this experiment was a
double-stranded oligonucleotide corresponding to the
JCV NCCR KB element that we have described previ￾ously [7,8]. As expected, ectopic p65 expression or
short term treatment with TNF-α induced the appear￾ance of a new band (lanes 3 and 4, position 2) and
this new band contained p65 since antibody to p65
removed the band (lanes 7 and 11) whereas nonimmune
rabbit serum did not (lanes 8 and 12) and induced the ap￾pearance of a lower mobility supershifted band (position 1).
When cells were treated with TSA, this also induced a band
in position 2 (lane 4) indicating that acetylation stimulation
is associated with protein binding to the KB element
and this band also contained p65 since antibody to
p65 removed the band (lane 9) whereas nonimmune
rabbit serum did not (lane 10) and induced the ap￾pearance of a lower mobility supershifted band albeit
slightly below position 1 and more diffuse. Thus, in￾hibition of deacetylation is associated with increased
binding of NF-κB p65 to its binding site in the JCV
NCCR.
TSA induces acetylation of histone H3 on lys-9 detected
be ChIP assay
To confirm changes in histone acetylation in viral chro￾matin induced by TSA, antibody to acetyl-histone H3
(Lys9) was used in IP for extracts from cells treated with
and without TSA followed by PCR with primers that
flank the NCCR (Figure 7A). A band was observed of
the expected size for cells treated in the presence of
TSA (lane 3) but not in its absence (lane 2). No band
was observed with nonimmune rabbit serum (NRS, lane
2). These data confirm the expected changes in histone
modifications induced by inhibition of histone deacetylase
by TSA. In addition, we explored the possibility that p65
binding to the JCV NCCR might cause changes in histone
acetylation. ChIP was performed on extracts from cells
transfected with p65 expression plasmid or control empty
vector plasmid in combination with the JCV NCCR (wt or
m1) and treated with or without TSA followed by PCR
with primers that flank the NCCR (Figure 7B). Again, a

siRNA and treated with TSA as indicated, harvested and assayed for
luciferase activity. Activities were normalized to untreated controls.
The bar represents one standard deviation. Western blots were
performed for p65 and Grb2 (loading control) and are shown inset
in each panel.
Figure 6 Effect of p65 expression, TSA and TNF-α treatment on
EMSA of the KB site. An oligonucleotide corresponding to the JCV
NCCR KB element was used to perform EMSA using nuclear extracts
from untreated cells (Control) or cells transfected with expression
vector for p65, treated with TSA overnight or with TNF-α for 30 min
as described in Methods. For supershifts, antibody to p65 (αp65) or
nonimmune rabbit serum (NRS) was added as indicated. Competitor –
excess unlabelled probe was added. Unbound probe (loaded alone in
lane 1) runs near the bottom of the gel (Position 4).

band was observed of the expected size for cells treated in
the presence of TSA but not in its absence. The presence
of transfected p65 did not have a significant effect. Thus,
either binding of p65 to the wt JCV NCCR is without ef￾fect on histone acetylation or binding of p65 has only a
local effect on histone acetylation that is below the level
necessary for detection by this assay.
Discussion
The state of latency/persistence is of central importance
to the life cycle of JCV and when it is disrupted, the
pathological events leading to PML ensue. While the site
and molecular nature of viral latency/persistence are
poorly understood, JCV is thought to persist in a num￾ber of organs including the kidney, bone marrow and
brain [reviewed in [2,20]. In the kidney, JCV has an
archetype NCCR configuration [21] and is likely under￾going active asymptomatic replication at a low level or
episodically in the epithelial cells of the kidney tubules
as shown by continuous shedding of the same strains of
JCV [22]. On the other hand, JCV detected in the brain
has a neurotropic configuration [23,24] and is likely to
be within viral chromatin in a nonreplicating,
nontranscribed state since JCV DNA can be detected
but not expression of viral proteins [23]. Since, tran￾scription of a given piece of DNA can be regulated by
epigenetic modification to chromatin, we surmised that
such regulation may occur for JCV.
Post-translational covalent modifications of chromatin,
i.e., epigenetic changes, determine the openness of chro￾matin conformation and availability to the transcrip￾tional apparatus, which can determine the level of gene
expression of a region of DNA within the cell nucleus
[10,11]. The major determinants of the epigenetic status
of chromatin are DNA methylation and histone acetyl￾ation. Thus, in our initial experiments, we inhibited
DNA methylation with AZA or enhanced acetylation of
histones with HDACi, which would be expected to in￾crease transcription if it was restrained DNA methyla￾tion or lack of histone acetylation respectively. We
found that both JCV early and late transcription were
greatly stimulated by the HDACi TSA and SB but not by
AZA (Figure 1) indicating the importance of protein
acetylation in JCV regulation but no involvement of
DNA methylation. Since typically, promoter regulation
involves large promoter-proximal CpG islands [13] and
JCV contains only 6 CpGs in the NCCR [5], this is per￾haps not surprising. Importantly, since our JCV early
and late reporter constructs contained many extraneous
CpGs from the luciferase and vector regions of the plas￾mids, these may potentially interfere with our analyses
and so it was important to verify our data using a CpG￾free reporter plasmid background. We used plasmids
based on pCpGL-basic, which completely lacks CpG di￾nucleotides [15] and these constructs gave essentially
similar data (Figure 2A). For some earlier studies, we
had generated some stably transfected JCV early and late
Figure 7 Effect of TSA on histone H3 acetylation in the JCV NCCR. A. TC620 cells were treated with or without TSA as indicated and ChIP
assays performed as described in Methods. The positive control for the PCR was 1/10 of the input extract used in the IPs. MWM – molecular weight
markers; α-Ac H3 – antibody to acetyl-histone H3 (Lys9); NRS – nonimmune rabbit serum; No Ab – no antibody added to the IP (beads alone); PCR

combination with the JCV NCCR (wt or m1) and treated with or without TSA as indicated and ChIP assays performed as in Panel A.

clonal reporter cell lines from TC620 cells [9]. When we
investigated the effects of the epigenetic reagents, we
also obtained the same results (Figure 2B & C) as for the
transient transfection experiments.
Analysis of mutant JCV promoters implicated the KB
element of the NCCR in mediating the effect of histone
deacetylation inhibition since mutations in the elem￾ent (m1 and m2) abrogated the effect (Figure 3A)
and the effect of p65 on a heterologous promoter
containing the KB element was potentiated by sodium
butyrate (Figure 3B). Further, the stimulation of JCV
late transcription by p65 was potentiated by TSA
(Figure 4A) and siRNA to p65 inhibited the stimulatory
effect of TSA on early (Figure 5A) and late (Figure 5B)
transcription. It should be noted that there is one other
report of JCV activation by HDACi I the literature [25]
using the MH1 strain of JCV. In this report, deletion and
site-directed mutational analyses of TSA-mediated activa￾tion indicated the importance of the enhancer region and
an Sp1 binding site upstream of the TATA box, which is
not present in the Mad-1 JCV NCCR [26]. Thus, it is pos￾sible that the mechanism of transcriptional induction by
TSA may vary between strains of JCV.
From the gel shift data in Figure 6, it can be seen that
p65 binding is induced by p65 overexpression (as expected),
or TNF-α treatment, which activates the NF-κB signaling
pathway (also expected) or by TSA. The TSA induction
indicates that increased acetylation of p65, histones in the
chromatin at the NF-κB site or both is sufficient to recruit
NF-κB binding. By performing chromatin immune precipi￾tation (ChIP) assays, we were able to show that TSA
induced acetylation of histone H3 on lysine-9 within the
chromatin of the JCV NCCR (Figure 7) but the assay was
not sensitive enough to reveal if TSA changed the acetyl￾ation status of p65 using either acetyl-p65-specific antibody
or anti-p65 immunoprecipitation followed by Western blot
with anti-acetyl-lysine antibody (data not shown). Similarly,
no effect of p65 on histone acetylation within the chroma￾tin of the JCV NCCR was observed in the absence of TSA
(Figure 7B) indicating that either it does not occur or, if it
does, it is below the level necessary to be detected by the
ChIP assay.
Taken together, our data suggest the region of chroma￾tin at the NF-κB-binding site is involved in the stimulation
of Mad-1 JCV transcription by HDACi such as TSA. The
mechanism of this effect is still under investigation but it
is possible that acetylation of histones and/or p65 via the
p300 transcriptional coactivators/acetyltransferases is
involved. NF-κB p65 is regulated by acetylation by p300
and CBP acetyltransferases, which principally target ly￾sines 218, 221 and 310 [17-19]. Analysis of p65 mutants
containing lys-to-arg substitutions indicates acetylation at
K221 enhances DNA binding and impairs assembly with
IκBα while acetylation at K310 is required for full p65
transcriptional activity [18]. In another study, data pointed
to a role for K314/K315 in regulating p65 function [27].
As well as binding p65, the KB element binds C/EBPβ LIP
[7] and NFAT4 [8], which act together with p65 to regu￾late JCV transcription. Hence, it is also possible that
acetylation of these proteins is also involved in controlling
transcription. C/EBPβ is functionally modified at several
lysine residues but only K215/K216 is in the LIP domain
[28]. There are no reports of NFAT4 acetylation but
NFAT2 is acetylated [29]. In principal, acetylation of any
of the three transcription factors, NF-κB p65, C/EBPβ and
NFAT4, alone or in combination, may be responsible for
activation of the JCV KB element by HDACi.
In conclusion, our data are consistent with a model
where latent JCV is present in transcriptionally silent,
deacetylated chromatin but can be activated by the ac￾tion of transcription factors that act downstream from
cytokines such as TNF-α and involve acetylation events.
This is similar to latent HIV-1 provirus where marked
transcriptional activation of the HIV-1 promoter also oc￾curs in response to deacetylase inhibitors. Deacetylation
events are an important mechanism of HIV-1 transcrip￾tional repression during latency, whereas acetylation
events are involved HIV-1 reactivation from latency [30].
Notably, HDACi (TSA and SB) synergized with both ec￾topically expressed p50/p65 and TNF-α treatment to
activate the HIV-1 LTR [31]. While these findings with
HIV could open new therapeutic strategies aimed at de￾creasing or eliminating the pool of latently HIV-infected
reservoirs by forcing viral expression, our findings for JCV
could open new therapeutic strategies for PML aimed at
preventing viral expression and containing JCV in a latent
state. Finally, at least ten human polyomaviruses are now
known to exist [32] and it will be of interest to investigate
if any of these are also regulated epigenetically.
Methods
Cell culture and plasmids
Culture of the human TC620 oligodendroglioma cell line
was performed as we have previously described [9].
Stable clonal cell lines expressing luciferase under the
control of the JCV early and late promoters were derived
from TC620 as previously described [9]. Reporter con￾structs, JCVE-LUC and JCVL-LUC contained the JCV
promoter from the Mad-1 strain linked to the luciferase
gene in the early and late orientations respectively [9].
JCVE-LUC promoter mutants m1 and m2 contained
mutations at two adjacent sites within the KB site of the
early promoter and heterologous reporter plasmids,
pBLCAT2-wt-kB and pBLCAT2-mt-kB contained wild￾type and mutant KB elements respectively cloned into
the CAT reporter plasmid pBLCAT2, which contains the
constitutive Herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (tk)
promoter [9]. New reporters were generated based on a

Rehli, University Hospital Regensburg, Germany [15] by
cloning the Mad-1 JCV NCCR was cloned into the BglII
site of pCpGL-basic (pCpGL-JCVE and pCpGL-JCVL).

The following antibodies were used for Western blot:
Rabbit polyclonal anti-p65 (c-20, sc-372, Santa Cruz Bio￾technology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) and mouse monoclonal
anti-Grb2 (610111; BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). For
EMSA, rabbit polyclonal anti-p65 (c-20, sc-372X, Santa
Cruz) was used and for ChIP, rabbit monoclonal to
acetyl-histone H3 (K9) (C5B11, Cell Signaling Technol￾ogy, Danvers MA).
Western blots
Western blot assays were performed as previously described
[8]. Briefly, 50 μg of protein was resolved by SDS-PAGE,
transferred to nitrocellulose, and immunoblotted with pri￾mary antibody (1/1000 dilution) and secondary antibody
(1/10000 dilution). Bound antibody was detected with an
ECL detection kit (Amersham, Arlington Heights, IL).
Transient transfection and reporter assays
Co-transfection of reporter plasmids and expression
plasmids were performed as we have previously de￾scribed [7,9]. Briefly, TC620 cells were transfected with
reporter constructs alone (0.5 μg) or in combination
with the various expression plasmids for 48 h prior to.
The total amount of transfected DNA was normalized
with empty vector DNA. Treatment with epigenetic re￾agents was performed for 24 h prior to harvesting: SB – 0,
5 mM, 20 mM and 15 mM; TSA – 0, 0.2 μM, 0.4 μM and
1 μM; AZA – 0, 10 μM, 15 μM and 25 μM. Assays for
luciferase and CAT were performed as previously de￾scribed [7,9]. For RNA interference experiments, 200 nmol
of Smartpool siRNA or control nontargeting siRNA
(Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO) against p65 were transfected
into cells 48 hours prior to transfection with the reporter
plasmid as we have previously described [7].
Gel shift assays
TC620 cells were transfected with p65 expression plas￾mid for 48 h, treated overnight with 250 nM TSA or
treated 10 ng/ml TNF-α for 30 min and then harvested.
Nuclear proteins were then extracted and 10 μg were in￾cubated with 50,000 cpm of a γ￾32P-labeled, double￾stranded oligodeoxyribonucleotide probe as previously
described [7]. The probe that was used in these gel shift
experiments corresponded to the KB element: κB: 5′-
aaaacaagggaatttccctggcctc-3′ (nts 5052–5078, Mad-1
JCV, GenBANK # NC_001699).
Chromatin immune precipitation (ChIP) assay
TC620 cells were plated at a density of 1 × 106 cells/ml
in 100 mm dishes and the next day transfected with 3
μg of JCVE-LUC plasmid. The next day, cells were
treated with 0.5 μM TSA for 24 hours and ChIP assays
performed using the ChIP assay kit (Upstate Cell Signal￾ing Solutions) as we have previously described [7].
Briefly, cells were cross-linked with formaldehyde and
DNA sheared by sonication. After lysis, immunoprecipi￾tation was performed with antibody to acetyl-histone H3
(Lys9) or nonimmune rabbit serum control as indicated.
After DNA extraction, PCR was performed using the fol￾lowing primers which amplify a region spanning the en￾tire JCV NCCR:
Forward: 5′-cctccctattcagcactttgtcc-3′ (Mad-1, 4989–
5011).
Reverse: 5′-ggccagctggtgacaagcc-3′ (276–258).
PCR was 30 cycles (94°C for 30 s, 55°C for 30 s, 72°C
for 30 s) then 72°C for 7 min.
