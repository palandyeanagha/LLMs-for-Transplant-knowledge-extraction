Summary 
HLA identical fibroblasts were transplanted into three patients 
with Sanfilippo A syndrome in an attempt to prolong the effective￾ness of enzyme replacement therapy. The donors were the patients' 
mothers or brother and showed no mixed leucocyte reaction when 
tested against their recipients' cells. Fibroblast cultures from 
donors were established with 0.2 X 0.3 cm full-thickness skin 
biopsies from the anterior surface of the forearm; and their ability 
to correct abnormal 36S04 incorporation in the recipients' cells 
was confirmed before grafting. At the time of grafting, all patients 
were severely mentally subnormal. All three patients were on an 
immunosuppressive regimen of 25 mg Imuran and 20 to 25 mg 
prednisolone daily for 4 wk before fibroblast transplant, and this 
was continued for approximately 5 months afterwards. When the 
primary cultures were confluent, the cells were removed by tryp￾sinisation, and approximately 2 X 10' viable cells were injected as 
a suspension into four subcutaneous dorsal sites. 
Excretion of urinary glycosaminoglycans precipitable by 5-ami￾noacridine increased markedly in all three patients after trans￾plant, the mean increases ranging from 12 to 76%. Uronic acid￾containing low-molecular-weight oligosaccharides in the urine also 
increased considerably in two of the three patients, with mean 
increases of 3,65. and 84% being recorded. Oligosaccharides were 
separated into six fractions (1-6) by chromatography on Bio-Gel 
P-2. Urine samples collected before transplant contained a much 
higher proportion of oligosaccharides of larger hydrodynamic size 
than did samples taken after treatment. The relative proportions 
of peaks 11-V decreased after transplant, whereas at the same 
time, there was marked increase in the proportion of peak Va. The 
sulphamino/hexosamine molar ratios of fraction IV decreased 
from 0.64 to 0.29 and from 0.53 to 0.35 in two of the three patients 
after transplant, whereas the third patient showed little change. A 
protein fraction precipitated by ammonium sulphate from urine 
samples was tested for its ability to reduce the abnormally high 
%04 accumulation in fibroblasts cultivated from biopsies taken 
from each patient before transplant. Most samples taken before 
transplant had little corrective factor activity, with mean activities 
ranging from 2.5 to 19% of normal control values. Excretion of 
corrective factor rose sharply after transplant in all three patients, 
with a mean level ranging from 48 to 58% of that found in normal 
age-related controls. The three patients selected for this treatment 
were observed for periods ranging from 3 years, 3 months to 2 
years, 2 months, during which time there were no consistent 
changes in development achievements, joint mobility, or fiver and 
spleen size as assessed by serial scans. 
Speculation 
We speculate that the implanted donor fibroblasts survived for 
a long period of time and possibly even increased in number in the 
recipients' subcutaneous space. They released glucosamine N￾sulphatase, which could enter the patients' cells by adsorptive 
endocvtosis and become incorporated into Igsosomes, increasing 
catabolism of glycosaminoglycan accumulated there. It is possible 
that repeated fibroblast transplants may increase enzyme levels 
sufficiently to produce clinical correction, particularly in younger 
patients in whom physical and mental deterioration has not yet 
become irreversible. 
Sanfilippo type A disease is one of a group of closely related 
inherited disorders of connective tissue, the mucopolysacchari￾doses, which arise from profound deficiencies in one of the several 
lysosomal exoglycosidase or sulphatase enzymes necessary for 
complete catabolism of dermatan and heparan sulphates (17). The 
deficient enzyme in Sanfilippo type A disease is the sulphatase 
acting on sulphamino groups at the nonreducing termini of par￾tially degraded heparan sulphate chains (15, 24), leading to their 
massive accumulation as lysosomal storage products and their 
excretion in large amounts in urine. Somatic changes induced by 
this accumulation are less marked than in other types of muco￾polysaccharidosis, but mental retardation is severe (17, 23). Be￾cause lysosomal enzymes can be rapidly taken up by active 
pinocytosis (10, 13, 20, 22) and become incorporated into phago￾somes, together with accumulated storage products, the muco￾polysaccharidoses, in common with many other inherited defi￾ciencies in lysosomal enzymes, are well suited to replacement 
therapy with a suitable source of normal enzymes. 
Infusions of normal plasma into three patients with Sanfilippo 
disease (3) produced specific changes in excreted glycosaminogly￾cans (GAG) consistent with those expected from increased break￾down and mobilisation of storage products. These changes were 
not seen when one of these patients was given an equivalent 
volume of iso-osmotic dextran solution (4). The changes observed 
after plasma infusion were, however, only transient, presumably 
because of the short intracellular half-lives of most lysosomal 
enzymes (10, 19). 
The ability of fibroblasts to induce a long-lasting increase in 
the level of deficient lysosomal enzymes in other types of muco￾polysaccharidosis was demonstrated using skin allografts in a 
patient with Hunter syndrome (5). Moreover, fibroblasts derived 
from HLA identical donors were transplanted into three further 
cases of Hunter syndrome and again induced increased catabolism 
of accumulated GAG, coupled with an increase in activity of the 
previously deficient lysosomal enzyme iduronate sulphatase (6,7). 
We now report the effect of transplanting HLA identical fibro￾blasts into three patients with Sanfilippo A syndrome in an 
attempt to prolong the effectiveness of enzyme replacement ther￾apy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS 
In all three patients, there was heparan sulphaturia and typical 
clinical features of Sanfilippo disease (17). The diagnosis of San￾filippo type A disease was confirmed by demonstration of severe 
deficiency of heparan N-sulphatase activity in cultured fibroblasts. 
The donors showed no mixed leucocyte reaction against their 
recipients and were either HLA identical (V. H., K. E.) or had no 
HLA antigens other than those shared by the recipient (S. B.). 
Before grafting, the ability of donor fibroblasts to correct abnormal 
35~04 incomoration in the recipient's cells was confirmed in 
culture (2).'~t the time of gafiing, all patients were severely 
mentally subnormal. Approval for the transplants was obtained 
from the Guy's Hospital and Medical School Committee on 
Ethical Practice, and informed consent for the procedures was 
obtained from both parents. 
This girl received her transplant in October, 1976, at age 5 years 
and 6 months. Developmental retardation was detected at 2 years 
of age. The patient and her unaffected brother, who was the 
donor, were both HLA 2, 10; 12, W16. 
This girl received her transplant in December, 1976, at age 5 
years and 2 months. Her parents were first cousins. Developmental 
retardation was detected at 3 years of age. The patient and her 
mother, who was the donor, were both HLA 2, 9; 12, 27. 
This girl received her transplant in November, 1977, at age 12 
years and 4 months. Developmental retardation was detected at 3 
years of age. The patient was HLA W25, 11; 12, W35 and her 
mother, who was the donor, was HLA 11; 12, W35. 
All three patients were onan immunosuppressive regimen of 25 
mg Imuran and 20 to 25 mg prednisolone daily for 4 wk before 
fibroblast transplant and continued for approximately 5 months 
afterwards. Patients were assessed before and 6 wk after transplant 
and at approximately 3-monthly intervals thereafter. In addition 
to clinicalkxamination, which included photographic recording of 
joint mobility, the following investigations were made: liver and 
spleen scans, radiologic skeletal survey, and intellectual and de￾velopmental assessments. 
LABORATORY PROCEDURES 
Urine collections (24 hr when possible) were stored at -20°C 
with 10 ml of toluene as preservative. Glycosaminoglycans and 
oligosaccharides were isolated from 100 ml aliquots of each urine 
collection, as previously described (7). Creatinine was determined 
by the method of Taussky (21). Uronic acid in urine samples was 
determined by the method of Bitter and Muir (1) and in column 
effluents by an automated procedure (1 1). Hexosamine was esti￾mated as described by Kraan and Muir (14), and sulphamino 
groups were estimated by the method of Langunoff and Warren 
(16) after acetylation. Oligosaccharides were fractionated on a 
column (2.0 x 100 cm) of Bio-Gel P-2, 200 to 400 mesh (7), and 
corrective factor was concentrated from urine and assayed as 
described by Cantz et al. (2).

FIBROBLAST CULTURE AND TRANSPLANTATION 
Fibroblast cultures from donors were established with 0.2 X 0.3 
cm full-thickness skin biopsies from the anterior surface of the 
forearm. These were cultuied in triplicate in Dulbecco's minimal 
essential medium supplemented with 4 mM L-glutamine and 
containing penicillin, 200,000 units, streptomycin, 200 mg/litre, 
and either fetal bovine serum, 100 ml (for patients K. E. and S. 
B.) or donor calf serum, 150 ml (for V. H.) per litre, in Falcon 
tissue culture flasks no. 3024 (Falcon Plastics, Division of Bio￾Quest, Oxnard, CA) in an air incubator at 37°C. When the 
primary cultures were confluent, the cells were removed by tryp￾sinisation with 0.25% (w/v) trypsin (Wellcome Laboratories, 
Beckenham, Kent, England) in serum-free phosphate-buffered 
saline (PBS) and subcultured at a split ratio of 5:l. One further 
subculture at a split ratio of 6:l was required to obtain sufficient 
cells for transplantation. Before transplantation, cells were again 
trypsinised for 20 min at 37°C in PBS and washed twice in PBS 
before resuspending them in approximately 4 ml of serum-free 
culture medium for injection. Approximately 2 x 10' viable cells 
were injected as a cell suspension into four subcutaneous dorsal 
sites. 
RESULTS 
Excretion of urinary glycosaminoglycans precipitable by 5- 
aminoacridine increased markedly in all three patients after trans￾plant (Table 1). Uronic acid-containing low-molecular-weight 
oligosaccharides in the urine also increased considerably in two 
(V. H. and S. B.) of the three patients. Although total uronic acid 
excretion increased after treatment, the overall levels were far 
from constant, showing considerable daily fluctuations. 
Oligosaccharides were separated into six fractions (I-Va) by 
chromatography on Bio-Gel P-2, one of which (I) eluted with the 
void volume and was not analysed further (Fig. 2). Urine samples 
collected before transplant contained a much higher proportion of 
oligosaccharides of larger hydrodynamic size (i.e., those eluting 
towards the void volume) than samples taken after treatment (Fig. 
1). When the mean peak areas of fractions 11-Va from all samples 
analysed were calculated and expressed as a percentage of total 
uronic acid eluted, it could be seen that there was a marked 
increase in the relative proportions of peak Va, which amounted 
to 37% in patient V. H., 19% in patient K. E., and 7% in patient 
S. B. 
Fractions V and Va were found to contain less than 2% hexos￾amine on further analysis, whereas fractions I1 and I11 obtained 
after transplant contained too little total uronic acid for further 
accurate analyses to be made. Sulphaminohexosamine ratios were 
therefore determined only on pooled samples of fraction IV. As 
can be seen in Table 2, the sulphamino-hexosamine molar ratios 
of this fraction decreased in two of the three patients after trans￾plant, whereas the third patient (S. B.) showed little change. 
A protein fraction precipitated by ammonium sulphate from 
urine samples was tested for its ability to reduce the abnormally 
high 35S04 accumulation in fibroblasts cultivated from biopsies 
taken from each patient before transplant. The activity of this 
protein fraction, which in normal individuals contains glucosa￾mine N-sulphate sulphatase, the enzyme deficient in Sanfilippo A 
disease, showed considerable daily fluctuation (Fig. 2). Most 
samples taken before transplant had little or no corrective factor

activity, with mean activities ranging from 1.8% of normal control 
values in the case of patient V. H. to 8.0% with patient S. B. (Table 
3). Excretion of corrective factor rose sharply after transplant in 
all three patients, with a mean level ranging from 48 to 58% of 
that found in normal age-related controls. 
The three patients selected for this treatment were all severely 
affected both physically and mentally. They were observed for 
periods ranging from 3 years, 3 months to 2 years, 2 months, 
during which time there were no consistent changes in develop￾mental achievements, joint mobility, or liver and spleen size as 
assessed by serial scans. 
DISCUSSION 
The biochemical changes observed here after transplantation of 
HLA identical fibroblasts were remarkably similar to those pre￾viously seen when three patients with Hunter syndrome (a-L￾idurono-2-sulphate sulphatase deficiency) received fibroblast 
transplants (7). These changes included an increased excretion 
both of GAGS and oligosaccharides of lower molecular weight. A 
decrease in the relative proportions of the larger oligosaccharides

separated by chromatography on Bio-Gel P-2 was accompanied 
by a corresponding increase in the oligosaccharides of lowest 
hydrodynamic size. Further, there was a decrease in the sulph￾amino content of one of the major oligosaccharide fractions in 
two of the Sanfilippo patients, which was similar to the decrease 
in sulphate content of an equivalent fraction previously observed 
in all three treated Hunter patients (7). 
In patients with a deficiency of specific lysosomal sulphatase 
enzymes, a measurable decrease in the sulphate content of urinary 
oligosaccharides after fibroblast transplant is highly indicative of

increase in activity of the deficient enzyme. This is further evi￾denced in the present cases by the accompanying increase in the 
total urinary excretion of oligosaccharides, and by a decrease in 
the proportion of higher molecular weight oligosaccharides. These 
effects are compatible with catabolism of stored GAGS. 
More direct evidence for increase in the activity of glucosamine 
N-sulphate sulphatase in all three patients after treatment was 
provided by large increases in the activity of urinary "corrective 
factor," which contains this enzyme. We measured specific correc￾tive factor rather than urinary or leucocyte glucosamine 
N-sulphatase because the former assay is more sensitive. Thus, 
duplicate assays for heparan sulphamidase (glucosamine N-sul￾phate) in normal leucocytes varied by 10 to 15% so that small 
increases in the activity in patients' leucocytes would not be 
detected. In Sanfilippo type B cells cultured in medium with 
added a-N-acetyl glucosaminidase, for example (19), increases of 
only 2 to 5% induced a 42 to 70% correction of radiosulphate 
metabolism. 
Both the increase in catabolism of accumulated storage products 
and the increase in the activity of corrective factors we observed 
here persisted after immunosuppressive therapy had ceased. 
Fibroblasts were chosen as a source of lysosomal enzymes 
because they appear to have the capacity to secrete many of the 
enzymes deficient in each type of mucopolysaccharidosis (10, 18, 
19), obviating the need for prior enzyme purification and the 
attendant dangers of altering enzyme recognition markers or 
immunologic status. Normal skin fibroblasts can correct the ab￾normal 35S-sulphate incorporation of fibroblasts from patients 
with mucopolysaccharidosis when grown together in culture (9) 
because they appear to release lysosomal enzymes which can be 
taken up by deficient fibroblasts and so restore normal physiologic 
functions (9). A good histocompatibility match between patients 
and donors, together with immunosuppressive therapy will pro￾mote long-term survival of donor fibroblasts. Exchange of lyso￾soma1 enzymes in vivo from normal to deficient cells has been 
shown to take place between leucocytes in cattle (12) and between 
hepatocytes in mice (8). Increases in catabolism of GAG and 
excretion of corrective factor demonstrated here over a long period 
indicates that fibroblast transplantation has promise as a method 
of enzyme replacement therapy. However, the observed biochem￾ical changes appeared rather too large to be accounted for by the 
relatively small numbers of cells transplanted, particularly because 
we have found that fibroblasts release only a small proportion of 
their lysosomal enzymes into their culture medium under normal 
in vitro conditions. Nevertheless, this small amount of enzyme 
may be sufficient to restore normal physiologic functions to a 
considerable degree. Alternatively, the donor cells may divide in 
vivo and increase in number or may be stimulated to release much 
larger amounts of lysosomal enzymes than are normally produced.
