Abstract
Background: Liver diseases are suspected risk factors for intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH). We
conducted a population-based case-control study to examine risk of ICH among hospitalised
patients with liver cirrhosis and other liver diseases.
Methods: We used data from the hospital discharge registries (1991–2003) and the Civil
Registration System in Denmark, to identify 3,522 cases of first-time hospitalisation for ICH and
35,173 sex- and age-matched population controls. Among cases and controls we identified patients
with a discharge diagnosis of liver cirrhosis or other liver diseases before the date of ICH. We
computed odds ratios for ICH by conditional logistic regressions, adjusting for a number of
confounding factors.
Results: There was an increased risk of ICH for patients with alcoholic liver cirrhosis (adjusted
OR = 4.8, 95% CI: 2.7–8.3), non-alcoholic liver cirrhosis (adjusted OR = 7.7, 95% CI: 2.0–28.9) and
non-cirrhotic alcoholic liver disease (adjusted OR = 5.4, 95%CI:3.1–9.5) but not for patients with
non-cirrhotic non-alcoholic liver diseases (adjusted OR = 0.9, 95%CI:0.5–1.6). The highest risk was
found among women with liver cirrhosis (OR = 8.9, 95%CI:2.9–26.7) and for patients younger than
70 years (OR = 6.1, 95%CI:3.4–10.9). There were no sex- or age-related differences in the
association between other liver diseases (alcoholic or non-alcoholic) and hospitalisation with ICH.
Conclusion: Patients with liver cirrhosis and non-cirrhotic alcoholic liver disease have a clearly
increased risk for ICH.
Background
Spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) is bleed￾ing into the parenchyma of the brain that may extend into
the ventricular system. ICH accounts for 10–15% of all
cases of stroke and less than 50% are alive after 12 months
[1] with many surviving patients suffering from hemipare￾sis and aphasia [2].

The most important risk factor for ICH is hypertension
[3], but age, male gender, diabetes, smoking, antithrom￾botic treatment, and drug abuse may also increase the risk
[4,5]. It is a frequent notion that liver patients are at
higher risk for ICH. However, few studies have examined
the role of liver cirrhosis and other liver diseases as possi￾ble risk factors. Most of the reports are case series without
controls [6-9], and the results are conflicting.
Liver diseases may be risk factors for ICH due to impaired
coagulation. High alcohol intake is an important risk fac￾tor for development of liver diseases and alcohol intake
may further induce hypertension. In addition, alcohol
intake is associated with changes in the coagulation sys￾tem and may also affect the integrity of cerebral vessels
[4,10-14].
Thus, it remains unresolved whether cirrhosis and other
liver diseases are risk factors for ICH. Therefore, we con￾ducted a population-based case-control study in order to
examine the association of liver cirrhosis and other liver
diseases with the risk of hospitalisation for ICH.
Methods
This study was conducted within North Jutland, Viborg
and Aarhus counties, Denmark with a population of 1.4
million from January 1, 1991, through 31 December 31,
2003. The National Health Service provides tax-supported
health care for all inhabitants, allowing free access to gen￾eral practitioners and hospitals, and it refunds a variable
proportion of the costs of prescribed drugs. Using the civil
registry number, unique to every Danish citizen and
encoding gender and date of birth, an individual and
complete hospital discharge and prescription history can
be established, and unambiguously linked to population￾based registers.
The ethics system in Denmark only deals with biological
testing of substances or devices in patients. An approval
was therefore not required for our study according to Dan￾ish law as it was a register based study. The study was,
however, approved by the National Data Protection
Agency."
Cases
The hospital discharge registries retain data on all dis￾charges from all somatic hospitals since 1977 [15]. The
files include the civil registry number, date of discharge,
and up to 20 discharge diagnoses and procedures, coded
according to the International Classification of Diseases,
8th revision until the end of 1993, and 10th revision
thereafter [15].
From the discharge history we identified patients with a
first-time discharge diagnosis of ICH (ICD8 431.00,
431.08–431.90, 431.98, 431.99; ICD10 I61.0–9) (n =
4,105). Data on drug use was available from 1991 for
North Jutland, from 1998 for Viborg and from 1996 for
Aarhus. We excluded patients who had not been residents
within the counties for at least one year or were younger
than 18 years or older than 90 years of age (n = 583). In
total, 3,522 cases were available for analyses, of which
2,987 (85%) were discharged from hospitals with in￾house computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI).
Population controls
From the Civil Registration System we selected 10 random
controls for each case, matching on age (same date of
birth), sex and county. We used the risk-set sampling [16],
i.e. the controls had to be alive (at risk for first ICH) at the
time the corresponding case was diagnosed. Overall, we
included 35,173 controls.
Liver diseases and possible confounders
Data were obtained from the hospital discharge registries
and included diagnoses of liver cirrhosis (ICD-8 code
571.09, 571.90, 571.91, 571.92, 571.99; ICD-10 code
K70.3, K74.3, K74.4, K74.5), other non-cirrhotic alco￾holic liver disease (ICD-8 code 571.10, 571.11; ICD-10
code K70.0, K70.1, K70.4, K70.9) and non-cirrhotic non￾alcoholic liver disease (ICD-8 code 570.00–571.08,
571.12–571.89, 571.93–571.98, 572.00–573.09, ICD-10
code K70.2, K70.5–K70.8, K71.0–K74.2, K47.7–K77.8).
Data on selected confounding factors for cases and con￾trols were obtained from the discharge and prescription
databases. These were hospital discharge diagnoses of
hypertension, chronic bronchitis and emphysema (used
as a proxy for smoking), and diabetes mellitus before or
during the admission for ICH. Data on drug usage were
obtained from the prescription databases. We collected
data on the following medication groups filled within 90
d before the ICH among cases or on the corresponding
date among controls: antihypertensive agents (ACE-inhib￾itors, beta-blockers, calcium antagonists, diuretics and
angiotensin II receptor antagonists); insulin or oral
hypoglycemic agents; platelet inhibitors (low-dose aspi￾rin, dipyridamol and clopidogrel); high-dose aspirin
(200–500 mg); statins; other lipid-lowering drugs; oral
anticoagulants (warfarin and phenprocoumon); and, for
women, hormone replacement therapy. All of the drugs,
except aspirin, were available only by prescription. Pen￾sioners and regular users of aspirin are registered in the
databases.
Statistical analysis
We computed odds ratios (OR) for ICH among hospital￾ised patients with liver cirrhosis and other non-cirrhotic
liver diseases by conditional logistic regressions. First, we

BMC Gastroenterology 2008, 8:16 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-230X/8/16

computed crude ORs and then ORs adjusted for the con￾founders, included as dichotomous variables. Analyses
were stratified according to sex, age and in-house access to
CT of MRI. Estimation of 95% confidence intervals (95%
CI) for ORs was based on large sample theory for condi￾tional maximum likelihood estimators.
Results
Characteristics of the 3522 cases with ICH and 35,173
controls are presented in Table 1. A history of previous
hospital admissions for hypertension (p < 0.0001) and
diabetes (p < 0.0001) was more frequent among cases
than among controls (Table 1). Further, a higher propor￾tion of cases than controls had used the examined drugs
(p < 0.05) except for statins and hormone replacement
therapy.
Most patients with cirrhosis had alcoholic cirrhosis (58/
67, 87%). Most patients with non-cirrhotic alcoholic liver
disease had alcoholic steatosis (30/56, 53%) or unspeci￾fied liver diseases associated with a history of alcohol
abuse (18/56, 32%). Among the patients with non-cir￾rhotic non-alcoholic liver disease, the majority had hepa￾titis, acute, subacute or chronic, (60/133, 45%) or other
unspecified liver diseases (58/133, 44%).
There was a five-fold increased risk for ICH among
patients with a diagnosis of liver cirrhosis or non-cirrhotic
alcoholic liver disease (Table 2). Both alcoholic and non￾alcoholic cirrhosis were associated with an increased risk
of ICH (Table 2).
In contrast, a diagnosis of non-alcoholic non-cirrhotic
liver disease was not associated with increased risk.
The shortest time interval between the diagnosis of liver
disease and hospitalisation with ICH was found among
patients with alcoholic cirrhosis (median time = 2.3 years,
range: 0.05–22.0 years) and non-cirrhotic alcoholic liver
disease (median time = 4.5 years, range: 0.2–25.1 years).
The corresponding time intervals were 6.2 years
(range:0.06–14.2 years) and 6.3 years (range:0.03–24.9
years) for patients with non-alcoholic liver cirrhosis and
patients with non-cirrhotic non-alcoholic liver disease,
respectively.
The risk of ICH in cirrhosis patients was highest among
women and patients younger than 70 years (Table 3).
There were no sex- or age-related differences in the associ￾ation between other liver diseases (alcoholic or non-alco￾holic) and ICH (data not shown).
Restricting the analysis to hospitals with access to CT or
MR did not change the overall findings. Adjusted ORs
were 5.6 (95% CI: 3.3–9.5), 5.9 (95% CI: 3.2–10.8) and
1.1 (95% CI: 0.6–1.9) for patients with liver cirrhosis,
other non-cirrhotic alcoholic liver disease and other non￾cirrhotic non-alcoholic liver disease, respectively. The
number of cases with liver disease hospitalised on hospi￾tals without easy access to brain imaging facilities was too
small to allow a separate multivariate analysis.
For comparison, we also computed the adjusted relative
risk estimates for other well-established risk factors for
ICH including a discharge diagnosis of hypertension
(adjusted OR = 2.2, 95% CI: 2.0–2.4) and use of oral anti￾coagulants (adjusted OR = 2.9, 95% CI: 2.5–3.5) and
platelet inhibitors (adjusted OR = 1.7, 95% CI: 1.5–1.9).
Discussion
In this population-based case-control study we found a
markedly increased risk for ICH among hospitalised
patients with liver cirrhosis or non-cirrhotic alcoholic
liver disease, while non-cirrhotic non-alcoholic liver dis￾ease did not increase the risk of ICH.

The strengths of the study are its size, its population-based
design and its ability to control for other risk factors to
ICH. The recording of exposure and confounder data into
the administrative registries before admission for ICH
excludes any risk of recall bias. The main limitation is the
use of routine hospital discharge diagnoses. It is well￾known that misclassification do occur in hospital dis￾charge registries and we cannot exclude the possibility
that miscoding may also have occurred in this study, in
particular for conditions mimicking spontaneous ICH,
including subarachnoid hemorrhage, hemorrhagic brain
infarction and traumatic brain injuries. However, the
overall high validity of the ICH diagnosis appear to be
high [17-19] although variation between specialized and
non-specialized departments have been reported [18,20].
In a random sample study we have shown a high predic￾tive value of 90% (95% CI: 81–95%) of the diagnosis in
departments with in-house CT or MRI scanners [21].
Restricting the analyses to departments with easy access to
brain imaging facilities did not substantially change the
results in our study, which may indicate that miscoding
was not a major problem in our study. In focusing on hos￾pitalised patients we may have missed patients with dis￾crete ICH or patients who died before reaching hospital.
Old people and patients with a short life expectancy may
have been less likely to be hospitalised. However, the age
distribution in our study (mean 67 years, range 18–89
years) shows that also very senior citizens with ICH were
hospitalised.
Finally, it should be noted that the sensitivity of some of
the hospital discharge diagnoses used in our study was
modest (e.g., only 16.6% of the cases and 7.3% of the con￾trols were registered with a hypertension diagnosis). To
compensate for this well-known limitation of hospital
discharge registries, we obtained data on the prescription
history of both cases and controls. The prescription data
revealed that a much higher proportion of both cases and
controls in fact suffered from hyptertension (i.e., 45% and
38% of cases and controls, respectively, used antihyper￾Table 2: Crude and adjusted ORs for ICH according to a diagnosis of liver disease before the date of hospitalisation.

tensives). The overall validity of our data was supported
by the fact that we found adjusted relative risk estimates
for well established ICH risk factors, including a discharge
diagnosis of hypertension and use of oral anticoagulants
and platelet inhibitors that were similar to those previ￾ously reported in the literature [3,22].
The increased risk of ICH for patients with liver cirrhosis
or alcoholic non-cirrhotic liver diseases is in accordance
with several case series [6-8,23]. Other studies indicate
that liver disease may also be associated with haematoma
enlargement, a major cause of clinical deterioration
[24,25]. In contrast, autopsy studies do not shown any
relation between liver cirrhosis and ICH, but rather report
a reduced risk of all thromboembolic events in cirrhosis
patients [26,27]. Likewise, there was no case of spontane￾ous ICH in a case series of 100 patients with coagulo￾pathic liver disease admitted for non-traumatic acute
mental changes [28].
A recent prospective study demonstrated discretely ele￾vated serum aminotransferases to be a predictor for ICH
(OR = 2.89 (2.09–4.01) [29] even after controlling for
alcohol intake, and also so in non-drinkers. This suggests
that even slight liver impairment may be a risk factor for
ICH independent of confounding by alcohol. A recent in￾vitro study on tissue from cirrhosis patients showed dam￾aged vessel walls and deficient platelet aggregation [30].
Such mechanism could be involved in the pathogenesis of
ICH and contribute towards the association of liver cir￾rhosis with ICH along with other changes in the coagula￾tion system in cirrhosis patients. A recent case-control
study from Chile found a higher proportion of ICH
patients with liver diseases compared to controls, how￾ever, liver diseases were not well defined [31] and no sig￾nificant association between liver disease and ICH was
demonstrated from the stroke registry of Dijon [32].
In the context of this study, the effects of alcohol are par￾ticularly important. Alcohol consumers have increased
risk of stroke as documented in several case-control, cross￾sectional and cohort studies. High alcohol intake
increases the risk of all stroke subtypes, ischemic and
hemorrhagic, while light to moderate alcohol intake pro￾tects, primarily against ischemic stroke of atherothrom￾botic origin [13,33-35]. The relation between high
alcohol intake and ICH may involve several mechanisms
among which alcohol-induced hypertension and coagula￾tion disorders – with or without cirrhosis – are the most
likely. The relation seems to be more complex when
involving cirrhosis. A previous clinical study did not find
an increased risk of alcohol-induced hypertension or ICH
in cirrhosis patients [36]. In contrast binge vs. regular
drinking seems to induce more severe hypertension [37].
In our study, liver cirrhosis was almost entirely alcohol￾related, which may contribute to the association between
liver cirrhosis and ICH in that group. However, both cir￾rhosis of alcoholic and non-alcoholic aetiology was asso￾ciated with the same increased risk, suggesting the high
risk to be related to cirrhosis as such, in accordance with
the conclusion of a review by Olson [38]. The non-cir￾rhotic alcoholic liver diseases were associated with the
same risk as was cirrhosis, whereas there was not increased
risk for non-cirrhotic non-alcoholic liver disease.
These findings give some support to the hypothesis of
alcohol being part of the mechanism of the association
between liver diseases and ICH although they are by no
way definitive. There may be additive or synergistic risks
due to the effects of alcohol and of cirrhotic coagulopathy.
It should be noted that the present data set using hospital
discharge diagnoses cannot be used to elucidate the effects
of recent alcohol intake on the risk of ICH.
Conclusion
Patients with alcoholic and non-alcoholic liver cirrhosis
and non-cirrhotic alcoholic liver disease had a substan￾tially increased risk for ICH. The findings, while not
excluding a risk mediated by alcohol, suggest an inde￾pendent risk due to liver cirrhosis.
