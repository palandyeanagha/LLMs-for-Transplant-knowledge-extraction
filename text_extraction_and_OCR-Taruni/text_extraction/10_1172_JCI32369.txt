In addition to its well-known expression in the germline and in cells of certain cancers, telomerase activity is
induced in lung fibrosis, although its role in this process is unknown. To identify the pathogenetic importance
oftelomerase in lung fibrosis, we examined the effects oftelomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) deficiency in
a murine model of pulmonary injury. TERT-deficient mice showed significantly reduced lung fibrosis follow￾ing bleomycin (BLM) insult. This was accompanied by a significant reduction in expression of lung α-SMA,
a marker of myofibroblast differentiation. Furthermore, lung fibroblasts isolated from BLM-treated TERT￾deficient mice showed significantly decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis rates compared with cells
isolated from control mice. Transplantation of WT BM into TERT-deficient mice restored BLM-induced lung
telomerase activity and fibrosis to WT levels. Conversely, transplantation of BM from TERT-deficient mice
into WT recipients resulted in reduced telomerase activity and fibrosis. These findings suggest that induction
of telomerase in injured lungs may be caused by BM-derived cells, which appear to play an important role in
pulmonary fibrosis. Moreover,TERTinduction is associated with increased survival oflung fibroblasts, which
favors the development of fibrosis instead of injury resolution.
Introduction
Telomeres consist of tandem hexanucleotide (TTAGGG)n repeats 
that cap the termini of eukaryotic chromosomes and play essen￾tial roles in maintenance of chromosomal stability and cell via￾bility (1). The complex that is responsible for telomerase activity 
includes a reverse transcriptase that adds on telomeric repeats at 
the end of chromosomes using an RNA template. This telomerase 
core enzyme consists of the telomerase RNA (TR) component and 
a polypeptide that bears classical structural motifs and functional 
activities of a telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT). The RNA 
component is constitutively expressed in both normal and cancer￾ous tissues expressing telomerase activity, but can also be detected 
in cells and tissues lacking detectable telomerase activity (2, 3). 
Thus TR appears not to be the limiting factor in the expression 
of telomerase activity. This is in contrast to TERT, whose expres￾sion correlates with presence of telomerase activity, hence TERT 
is considered as the key determinant of induction of telomerase 
activity (4–6). Previous studies have shown that telomerase is only 
functional during embryonic development and in the germline of 
the adult organism, but not in normal adult somatic cells. Further￾more, cells of highly proliferative and periodically or continuously 
renewing tissues, such as cells of the hematopoietic system and the 
epidermis, exhibit telomerase activity (7, 8). However in addition 
to these normally or constitutively telomerase-positive cells and 
tissues, recent studies have also demonstrated significant induc￾tion of telomerase activity in normally telomerase-negative adult 
tissues when exposed to injury. For instance, telomerase activity is 
highly induced in a rodent model of pulmonary injury and fibrosis 
induced by bleomycin (BLM), where it is shown to be selectively 
induced in fibroblasts but not in differentiated myofibroblasts (9). 
The BLM-induced telomerase activity is inhibited by treatment of 
these cells with IL-4 or TGF-β1, which are known to induce expres￾sion of α-SMA and myofibroblast differentiation (10). Indeed it 
has recently been shown that suppression of telomerase activ￾ity is closely associated with myofibroblast differentiation, while 
induction of telomerase by bFGF inhibits α-SMA expression (11). 
However, the role of telomerase in myofibroblast differentiation 
remains unclear, nor is it clear whether the induction of telomer￾ase is of importance in the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis.
Additional potential methods by which telomerase could play 
a role in fibrosis are based on the ample evidence suggesting that 
telomerase may be important in regulation of cell proliferation 
(12, 13), apoptosis (14–16), and cell differentiation (17, 18). In 
cells that do express telomerase activity, its expression is intimately 
related to cell growth (12). Telomere shortening limits the replica￾tive potential of organs and the lifespan of primary human cells in 
vivo during chronic diseases (13). Telomerase inhibition in human 
epidermoid tumor cell line A431 by a dominant-negative TERT 
mutant construct leads to chromosome damage, which in turn 
triggers apoptotic cell death (16). While inhibition of telomerase 
expression in progenitor cells is often regarded as a consequence 
of cell differentiation, these previous studies (8, 10, 11, 19) also 
indicate that the inhibition of telomerase activity could also serve 
as a prerequisite or initiator of the cell differentiation process.
Pulmonary fibrosis is characterized by increased extracellular 
matrix deposition and cellularity, especially with respect to fibro￾blasts at the site of active fibrosis. Myofibroblasts, with their char￾acteristic α-SMA expression, arise de novo in fibrosis, and they are 
thought to be the primary source of heightened matrix and pro￾fibrogenic cytokine expression (20–23). Increased numbers and 
persistence of these cells may be the basis for disease progression

instead of resolution, resulting in end-stage disease and a fatal out￾come (24, 25). Hence, understanding the origins, expansions, and 
possible fates of these activated fibroblasts is important to uncover 
the fibrotic pathogenesis. While telomerase activity is thought to be 
important for cancer cell propagation and its essentially unlimited 
replicative potential, the role of telomerase induction in the injured 
and fibrotic lung is unknown despite the demonstration of the 
telomerase-expressing fibroblast phenotype present during active 
fibrosis (9, 10). Here we investigated the in vivo role of telomerase in 
lung injury and fibrosis by comparing the responses to lung injury 
of TERT–/– mice and their WT counterparts. The findings using 
BLM to induce pulmonary fibrosis revealed that TERT deficiency 
caused reduced fibrosis and myofibroblast differentiation, which 
was restored by transplantation of WT BM to the TERT–/– mice.
Results
BLM-induced pulmonary fibrosis was reduced in TERT–/– mice. TERT–/–
mice were generated as previously described (26). To evaluate the 
amplitude of BLM-induced lung fibrosis in TERT–/– mice, lung col￾lagen content was compared in TERT–/– and WT mice by hydroxy￾proline (HYP) analysis at day 21 after BLM administration. The 
results showed that pulmonary fibrosis was significantly reduced 
in TERT–/– mice compared with WT mice (Figure 1). This marked 
reduction in biochemically assessed fibrosis was confirmed by 
morphological analysis of lung tissue sections. The results showed 
that while the lungs from BLM-treated WT mice exhibited typical 
severe pulmonary fibrosis, characterized by increased cellularity, 
loss of normal alveolar architecture, and thickening of alveolar 
septa, the lungs from BLM-treated TERT–/– mice had substantially 
less fibrosis, with more patchily distributed lesions that were 
much smaller in size and extension (Figure 2). Saline-treated con￾trol lungs showed no morphological abnormalities in both WT 
and TERT–/– mice, indicating that TERT deficiency did not impair 
normal lung development. Thus both biochemical and morpho￾logical assessment indicated that TERT deficiency resulted in sig￾nificantly reduced BLM-induced pulmonary fibrosis.
TERT deficiency reduced genesis of myofibroblasts in pulmonary fibrosis. 
Previously, alterations in telomerase expression were found to affect 
myofibroblast differentiation (11). To investigate whether TERT 
deficiency also affects the genesis of myofibroblasts in pulmonary 
fibrosis in vivo, lung α-SMA expression, a marker of myofibroblast 
differentiation, was analyzed by real-time PCR at day 7 after BLM￾induced lung injury. As expected, BLM treatment in WT mice caused 
a significant increase (>2-fold over saline-treated controls; P < 0.001) 
in lung α-SMA mRNA levels; conversely in TERT–/– mice, a slight, 
nonsignificant reduction was noted in the BLM-treated group 
relative to the saline-treated control group (Figure 3A). Consistent 
with these differences in lung tissue mRNA levels, α-SMA protein 
expression analyzed by Western blotting showed similar differences 
between the various groups (Figure 3B). Protein levels in WT mice 
were significantly higher (almost 2-fold increase; P < 0.001) in the 
BLM-treated compared with the saline-treated group, but in TERT–/–
mice were slightly decreased in the BLM-treated group and not 
significantly different from saline-treated controls. This pattern of 
differences in α-SMA expression was also reflected in fibroblasts iso￾lated from these lungs (data not shown). These findings indicated 
that myofibroblast differentiation as determined by α-SMA expres￾sion was significantly reduced in TERT–/– compared with WT mice.
Because BLM is also known to cause DNA strand scission and 
damage (27–29), the protective effect of TERT deficiency in the 
BLM model may be specific only for genotoxic injury–induced 
pulmonary fibrosis. To examine this possibility, DNA damage was 
evaluated in the BLM model using the Comet assay. The results 
showed that lung cell samples from both WT and TERT–/– mice 
at day 1 after BLM treatment did not exhibit comet tails (Figure 
4). In contrast, positive control samples from H2O2-treated cells 
induced marked comet tails, as expected. Lung cells from mice at 
day 7 after BLM treatment and primary cultured isolated fibro￾blasts from mice at days 1 and 7 after BLM treatment also showed 
no evidence of DNA damage (data not shown). Thus, BLM treat￾ment in vivo to induce pulmonary fibrosis, at the indicated dose 
(1.5 U/kg body weight), showed no evidence of genotoxicity using 
this assay. This made it unlikely that TERT deficiency protects 
only fibrosis resulting from a genotoxic insult.

To confirm this finding, the effect of TERT deficiency was stud￾ied in another model that is not known to be induced by a geno￾toxic insult, namely, one induced by FITC. While this model did 
not cause as severe a fibrosis as did BLM, the results did show a 
significant increase (~68%; P < 0.05) in lung type I collagen in WT 
FITC-treated mice (Figure 5). In contrast, lung type I collagen con￾tent was not significantly altered by FITC-treatment in TERT–/–
mice, reminiscent of the protection against BLM-induced fibrosis 
in these mice. These findings suggested that TERT deficiency also 
has a protective effect against FITC-induced pulmonary fibrosis, 
and thus the protective effect of TERT deficiency is not specific 
only to the BLM model.
TERT deficiency affected lung fibroblast proliferation and apoptosis. To 
explore the possible mechanisms by which fibrosis was reduced in 
TERT–/– mice, the effects of TERT deficiency on lung fibroblast 
proliferation and apoptosis were analyzed to determine whether 
reduction in fibroblast numbers could be a factor. The cell prolif￾erative responses of lung fibroblasts isolated from BLM- or saline￾treated mice (BLF and NLF, respectively) at day 14 were determined 
as described in Methods. The results showed that WT BLF prolifer￾ated at a significantly higher rate (>2-fold increase) than did WT 
NLF, whereas KO BLF proliferation was not significantly differ￾ent from KO NLF (Figure 6). Both the KO NLF and the KO BLF 
proliferation rates were not significantly different from the WT 
NLF rate, but were all significantly lower than the WT BLF rate. 
Thus TERT deficiency did not significantly affect proliferation in 
normal lung fibroblasts, but appeared to impair the emergence of 
an activated fibroblast population with higher proliferative rate in 
response to lung injury and remodeling.
The effect of TERT deficiency on fibroblast survival was also 
analyzed by assessing the response to a known apoptotic stimu￾lus (5 ng/ml TNF-α with 500 ng/ml cycloheximide [CHX]). The 
apoptotic response to TNF-α was evaluated by TUNEL staining in 
the same lung fibroblast populations described above. The results 
showed that in the absence of apoptotic stimuli, both WT NLF and 
WT BLF exhibited low levels of apoptotic cells (<4%), which were 
significantly lower than the levels in KO NLF (7.6%) or KO BLM 
(20.3%; Figure 7A). Treatment with TNF-α caused an increase in 
the apoptotic rate in all cells, but the increase was significantly 
higher in both the KO NLF (21.5%; P < 0.001) and the KO BLF cells 
(47.8%; P < 0.001) compared with their respective untreated groups 
and with both treated WT groups (P < 0.05). Analysis of apoptosis 
using flow cytometric assessment of annexin V–FITC–propidium 
iodide (annexin V–FITC–PI) staining confirmed the markedly 
higher apoptotic potential of lung fibroblasts from control and 
BLM-treated TERT–/– mice (Figure 7, B–I). Consistent with the 
data shown by TUNEL staining, the apoptotic cells in the absence 
of apoptotic stimuli were 1.86% and 2.96% in WT NLF and WT 
BLF, respectively, whereas the corresponding values in KO NLF 
and KO BLF were more than 2-fold higher at 7.76% and 7.74%, 
respectively. Treatment with TNF-α caused increases in apoptosis 
in all cell groups, which again were almost 3-fold higher in the 
KO compared with the WT groups. The results of these apoptosis 
experiments indicated that, relative to cells from WT mice, lung 
fibroblasts from TERT–/– mice are substantially more susceptible 
to apoptotic stimuli, especially in cells from injured lungs under￾going fibrosis. Thus, in addition to reduced proliferative capacity, 
the increased susceptibility to apoptosis may affect the survival of 
these cells and result in reduced cell numbers in TERT–/– mice.
Contribution of BM-derived cells to lung telomerase induction and fibrosis. 
Previously, GFP BM chimera mice have been used to determine the 
presence of BM-derived fibroblast-like cells in BLM-injured lung 
as well as which are TERT positive (30). To investigate the possibil￾ity that BLM-induced lung telomerase expression may be caused 
by recruitment of these BM-derived cells, and to assess their role 
in fibrosis, BM chimera WT and TERT–/– mice, transplanted with 
corresponding TERT–/– and WT BM, were created and analyzed for

plot are shown.

effects on BLM-induced lung telomerase and fibrosis. Sham con￾trols consisted of TERT–/– and WT mice receiving TERT–/– and WT 
BM, respectively. The results showed that transplantation of WT 
BM into TERT–/– mice reconstituted BLM-induced lung telomer￾ase activity to a level indistinguishable from that in WT mice (Fig￾ure 8A). Interestingly, transplantation of BM from TERT–/– mice 
to WT mice caused a marked reduction in BLM-induced lung 
telomerase induction. These findings showed that BM-derived 
cells were the main source of induced lung telomerase activity in 
BLM-induced pulmonary fibrosis.
In view of the ability of BM-derived cells to reconstitute the 
induction of lung telomerase activity by BLM treatment in TERT–/–
mice, the same BM chimera mice were analyzed for responses to 
BLM-induced pulmonary fibrosis. Analysis of lung HYP content 
on day 21 after BLM treatment showed the expected increase in 
sham-transplanted WT mice relative to saline-treated controls, 
which was significantly higher than that in sham-transplanted 
TERT–/– mice (Figure 8B). However, as in the case of telomerase 
induction (Figure 7A), transplantation of WT BM to TERT–/– mice 
reconstituted the WT response to BLM-induced fibrosis, while 
transplantation of BM from TERT–/– mice to WT mice reduced 
the response relative to that in sham-transplanted WT mice.
Because myofibroblast differentiation correlated with the fibrotic 
response to BLM, these groups of BM chimera mice were also ana￾lyzed for BLM-induced alterations in lung α-SMA protein levels by 
Western blotting. Consistent with the whole-lung HYP changes, 
the lung α-SMA expression was similarly altered in the various 
groups of mice (Figure 8C). Thus transplantation of WT BM to 
TERT–/– mice caused α-SMA induction by BLM to be at a level 
comparable to that in WT mice, while the converse transplanta￾tion of BM from TERT–/– mice to WT mice ablated this response. 
Taken together, these findings suggested that lung telomerase 
induction from BM derived cells in response to BLM treatment 
was important for the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis.
Discussion
The common feature characteristic of idiopathic pulmonary 
fibrosis (IPF) is the presence of fibroblastic foci, areas rich in 
mesenchymal cells, including increased numbers of fibroblasts 
and fully differentiated myofibroblasts. This population of cells 
is the key cellular source of extracellular matrix, and is hetero￾geneous with respect to a number of key pheno￾types (31, 32). The de novo emergence or genesis 
of α-SMA–expressing myofibroblasts is well 
described in lung fibrotic lesions in both human 
and animal model studies (20, 23). More recently, 
a telomerase-expressing fibroblast phenotype 
without appreciable α-SMA expression has been 
isolated from lungs of rats with BLM-induced 
pulmonary fibrosis during active fibrosis (9, 24). Telomerase 
is initially known to be expressed by cells with high prolifera￾tive capacity, and later studies also indicate that the overexpres￾sion of TERT subunit promotes stem cell proliferation without 
changes in telomere length (13, 33–35). There is evidence that 
this telomerase-expressing fibroblast phenotype in fibrosis could 
be differentiated to the myofibroblasts by certain cytokines such 
as TGF-β1 and IL-4, suggesting that this phenotype may be an 
intermediate toward terminal differentiation to the myofibro￾blast phenotype (10, 11). However, in view of the heterogeneity 
of the lung fibroblast populations noted previously, it remains 
uncertain whether this differentiation is occurring in the same 
cell or cell type or is the result of selection for one or more sub￾populations induced by the cytokine treatment. Moreover, the 
role of this lung injury–induced telomerase-expressing fibroblast 
phenotype in fibrosis is as yet undefined.
To begin addressing some of these issues, the effects of TERT 
deficiency on pulmonary fibrosis, genesis of the myofibroblast, and 
fibroblast survival were examined using the rodent BLM model. Our

data indicated that BLM induced much less fibrosis in TERT–/– mice 
relative to that in WT animals, as assessed by lung collagen content, 
histopathology, and α-SMA expression in the lung. BLM-induced 
lung injury causes increased numbers of fibroblasts and myofibro￾blasts in the lung associated with fibrosis, and the fibroblasts iso￾lated from such lungs show increased intrinsic proliferative capacity 
(23, 36). In view of the importance of telomeres in determining cell 
replicative potential and the role of telomerase in maintaining them, 
a potential mechanism for the protection from fibrosis afforded by 
TERT deficiency may be the result of a reduction in fibroblasts in 
the TERT–/– mice. The noted reduction in cellularity in the lung 
histopathology of TERT–/– mice would be consistent with such a 
possibility. Such a reduction may be caused by reduced proliferative 
potential and/or increased rates of cell death, perhaps in response to

apoptotic stimuli. A large body of evidence indicates that telomer￾ase is associated with cell proliferation and apoptosis. For example, 
conditional transgenic induction of TERT in mouse skin epithe￾lium causes a rapid transition from the resting phase of the hair 
follicle cycle to the active phase by causing proliferation of quies￾cent, multipotent stem cells in the hair follicle bulge region (13). It 
is noteworthy that this effect does not require the telomerase RNA 
component, suggesting that TERT can promote proliferation of 
resting stem cells through a noncanonical pathway. In contrast, the 
pathologies that occur in the telomerase-deficient mouse model are 
accompanied by a reduction in proliferative potential or increased 
apoptosis in the affected tissues (37–39). In one of these studies, TR 
deficiency–associated telomere shortening was coupled with attenu￾ation in cardiac myocyte proliferation but increased apoptosis (39). 
In agreement with these observations, other studies showed cell pro￾liferation failures in rapidly dividing tissues such as the hematopoi￾etic system and reduced life span in TR-deficient mice (40, 41).
In this report, to seek out the possible mechanisms for the noted 
reduction in pulmonary fibrosis as a consequence of TERT defi￾ciency, cell proliferation and apoptosis were examined in lung 
fibroblasts isolated from BLM- or saline-treated TERT–/– mouse 
lungs for comparison with those from similarly treated WT mice. 
Our findings showed that significantly lower proliferation and 
higher apoptosis rates were induced in lung fibroblasts from BLM￾treated TERT–/– mice compared with cells isolated from compa￾rably treated WT mice. Thus telomerase deficiency may provide 
protection from pulmonary fibrosis by reducing lung fibroblast 
proliferative potential but increasing susceptibility to apoptosis. 
These effects would thus result in reduced fibroblast numbers typ￾ically found in fibrotic lesions. Previously, siRNA-mediated repres￾sion of TERT in a human bladder cancer cell line was reported 
to downregulate EGFR expression, suggesting a potentially new 
function of TERT in the regulation of EGFR-stimulated prolif￾eration (35). There is evidence that EGFR or PDGFR are involved

mice were used as sham controls. Whole-lung lysates were collected at day 21 after BLM or saline treatments. (A) Lung telomerase activity was

in the proliferation and activation of myofibroblasts. The block￾ade of autophosphorylation of the EGFR or PDGFR by tyrosine 
inhibitors have been shown to suppress fibroblast proliferation 
and reduce fibrosis in a rat model of pulmonary fibrosis (42). The 
decrease of such proliferation-related growth factors may be a 
potential mechanism for reduced proliferation of fibroblasts in 
BLM-induced lung injury in TERT–/– mice.
Because BLM also has an effect on DNA damage (27–29), this 
protective effect of TERT deficiency may be specific to fibrosis 
induced by genotoxic injury. However, induction of fibrosis by 
the indicated dose of BLM (30 μg per 20-g mouse) did not cause 
detectable genotoxic injury using the standard Comet assay. This 
is not unexpected, because it is unlikely that the in vivo dose used 
would cause DNA damage to cells to the degree achieved by in vitro 
doses (>20 μg/ml) (27). Moreover, 100 mg/kg of BLM is required 
in vivo to induce DNA damage in liver of mice (29), which would 
be greater than 65-fold the dose used in this study for induction 
of pulmonary fibrosis. Thus it is unlikely that the protective effect 
of TERT deficiency would be specific to fibrosis due to a genotoxic 
insult. Furthermore, protection was also seen in another model 
induced by FITC, which is not known to be associated with geno￾toxic insult. Thus protection by lack of TERT is not specific to the 
BLM model or related to genotoxic-associated injury.
Given the association of telomerase expression with stem cells 
and the recent description of BM derivation of TERT-express￾ing fibroblasts in the BLM model (30), the contribution of BM￾derived cells to the induction of lung telomerase and fibrosis was 
evaluated. Using BM chimera WT and TERT–/– mice transplanted 
with BM from corresponding TERT–/– and WT mice, the studies 
revealed that BLM-induced lung telomerase activity was rescued in 
TERT–/– mice by transplantation with WT BM. The data also dem￾onstrated that the restored telomerase was sufficient to restore 
pulmonary fibrosis in this model. Moreover, the converse BM chi￾mera WT mice transplanted with BM from TERT–/– mice revealed 
a significant reduction in lung telomerase induction and fibrosis. 
Thus the BLM-induced lung telomerase activity and fibrosis were 
dependent on the recruitment of BM-derived cells, which affected 
lung myofibroblast differentiation, fibroblast proliferation, and 
apoptosis susceptibility. While the focus in this study was on the 
telomerase-expressing fibroblast, the findings cannot rule out the 
involvement of additional BM-derived cell types that are capable 
of expressing TERT. The precise nature or phenotype of these 
BM-derived cells require further elucidation in future studies.
It is well established that ectopic expression of TERT or reintro￾duction of a telomerase RNA component transgene into TERT–/–
ES cells can reconstitute robust telomerase activity and original 
growth rates (43–46). Transfection of TERT into fibroblasts results 
in telomere length elongation and extension of the in vitro replica￾tive life span (47, 48). The reconstituted telomerase was shown to 
rescue the expression levels of keratinocyte growth factor, IGF-II, 
and heparin-binding EGF in senescent human fibroblasts (49). 
The restoration of fibrosis induction by BLM in this study might 
also be explained by recovery of fibroblast proliferation rate and 
the expansion of life span, and thus rescue the expression of pro￾liferation-related growth factors.
In the present study, it is noteworthy that although the BLM￾induced telomerase activity and fibrosis were much lower in 
TERT–/– mice than in BLM-treated WT mice compared with their 
respective controls, the basal levels of lung α-SMA gene expres￾sion were higher in saline-treated TERT–/– mice than in WT mice 
(P < 0.05). These observations are consistent with a previous study 
showing that the induced loss of telomerase activity in cultured 
rat lung fibroblasts is closely associated with myofibroblast differ￾entiation and possibly functions as a trigger for such differentia￾tion (11). Conversely, increased expression of telomerase by bFGF 
suppresses myofibroblast differentiation. A recent observation 
indicates that BM-derived precursor cells could serve as a source 
for telomerase-expressing fibroblasts in this model of pulmonary 
fibrosis (30). Given that (a) proliferating collagen-expressing 
fibroblasts can differentiate into myofibroblasts and promote 
fibrosis and (b) TERT-positive fibroblasts could be differenti￾ated into myofibroblasts when they lose telomerase activity, the 
reduced fibrosis in TERT–/– mice may be caused by the migration 
of TERT–/– BM precursor cells with significantly reduced ability to 
survive. This reduced survival results in reduced overall fibroblast 
numbers and subsequent fibrosis.
Recent human studies of familial IPF, however, suggest an 
association between certain heterozygous mutations in TERT or 
TR and IPF in these families (50, 51), with the implication that 
shortened telomeres caused by deficiency in telomerase activity 
may play a role in disease pathogenesis. Although these muta￾tions are associated with shortened telomeres, the extent of short￾ening does not significantly correlate with development of IPF. 
Furthermore, some family members with these mutations and 
significant telomere shortening did not have IPF at the time of the 
study. But decreased telomere length associated with these muta￾tions suggests a potential role in the pathogenesis of IPF, such as 
by decreasing the regenerative capacity of alveolar epithelial pro￾genitors. However, it is unclear whether decreased telomere length 
would impair the proliferation of the type II pneumocyte or its 
differentiation to the type I pneumocyte, for example. Neverthe￾less, these findings in familial IPF indicate complex phenotypes, 
depending on the degree and type of telomerase deficiency, that 
may not be directly dependent on the extent of telomere shorten￾ing because telomere shortening and/or TERT or TR mutations 
per se are insufficient to cause pulmonary fibrosis. As the authors 
suggest, the interaction with other factors (e.g., smoking) may be 
necessary to induce IPF. In contrast to these human studies, the 
results reported here in TERT–/– mice would seem to suggest that 
the role of TERT is essential for pulmonary fibrosis induced by 
BLM, instead of having a protective effect. While it is likely that 
telomere length would be decreased in TERT–/– mice, especially in 
the later generations, this appears to be associated with impairing 
BLM-induced fibrosis instead of promoting it. Interestingly, how￾ever, this impairment was corrected by WT BM transplantation, 
indicating that it is the TERT in BM-derived cells that seems to 
be important in fibrosis. The basis for this apparent discrepancy 
between human familial IPF and this murine model of fibrosis is 
unclear, but may be related to different pathogenic mechanisms 
and/or species differences related to telomere lengths and their 
pathophysiological significance. Additionally, there is some 
uncertainty with respect to the possibility of additional roles for 
TERT beyond the mere maintenance of telomere length. TERT is 
primarily responsible for the catalytic activity of telomerase and 
is not required for other vital functions, such as having a struc￾tural role at the telomeres. Telomeric G-tails are essential for the 
higher-order telomere structure, and these have been found to be 
produced by telomerase-independent mechanisms in mice (26) as 
well as in human and yeast cells (52, 53). While telomere length 
maintenance is dependent on TERT expression (13, 35), additional

roles on cell functions, such as survival, growth, and proliferation, 
have not been excluded, and in fact are strongly suggested by the 
data reported in the present study.
In summary, the current report showed that TERT deficiency 
reduced BLM-induced mouse pulmonary fibrosis and myofibro￾blast differentiation, which were also associated with decreased 
lung fibroblast proliferation rate and increased susceptibility to 
apoptosis. The restoration of telomerase activity in TERT–/– mice 
by WT BM transplantation rescued BLM induction of lung telom￾erase activity and fibrosis, indicating the importance of BM-derived 
precursor cells capable of expressing TERT in the pathogenesis of 
pulmonary fibrosis. Further studies are necessary to probe the ori￾gin and nature of the BM-derived lung TERT-positive cells and the 
mechanism by which they participate in fibrosis.
Methods
Animals and induction of pulmonary fibrosis. C57BL/6 mice were purchased 
from The Jackson Laboratory. TERT–/– mice on C57BL/6 background 
were produced as previously described (26). Briefly, a 4-kb region contain￾ing exons γ, δ, and ε was replaced by neomycin resistance gene neo. Exon γ
codes for part of motif A of the mTERT protein (amino acids 701–753 
of mTERT). The first-generation mTERT–/– mice were fertile and did not 
show any noticeable gross or microscopic abnormality during early gen￾erations (G1 and G2). mTR expression levels were essentially same in WT 
and mTERT–/– mice. All tissue cells derived from mTERT–/– mice lacked 
telomerase activity, which suggests that mTERT is the only gene encoding 
the telomerase catalytic subunit. Telomeric DNA in mTERT–/– mice has 
G-strand 5′-overhangs, indicating that these telomeric 5′-overhangs are 
produced by telomerase-independent mechanisms. These mice were prop￾agated at the University of Michigan for these studies. G1–G3 mTERT–/–
mice were used for these studies.
For induction of BLM-induced pulmonary fibrosis, BLM (Blenoxane) 
was dissolved in sterile PBS and instilled endotracheally at a dose of 1.5 
U/kg body weight on day 0 as previously described (54). Control groups 
received the same volume of sterile PBS only. Mice (n = 3–5) were randomly 
assigned to each of the indicated treatment groups. At the indicated time 
points after BLM treatment, the mice were sacrificed, and their lungs were 
harvested rapidly. Where indicated, the lung tissue samples were immedi￾ately placed in TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) for total RNA isolation or in 
lysis buffer (50 mM Tris.Cl, pH 7.5, and 1% Nonidet P-40) for protein anal￾ysis. For histopathological analysis, 21 days after BLM injection the lungs 
were formalin-fixed and stained with routine H&E, as previously described. 
FITC-induced pulmonary fibrosis was performed as previously described 
(55). Briefly, 20 mg FITC (Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved in 10 ml sterile 
PBS, vortexed extensively, and followed by 30 seconds of sonication. This 
slurry was injected endotracheally into mice (5 mg/kg) using a 23-gauge 
needle. Twenty-one days after treatment, whole lung was homogenized 
in PBS supplemented with proteinase inhibitor (Roche Diagnostics) for 
analysis of type I collagen content by Western blotting. All animal studies 
were reviewed and approved by the University Committee on Use and Care 
of Animals at the University of Michigan.
Isolation of lung fibroblasts. Fibroblasts were isolated from isolated lung tis￾sue by trypsinization as described previously (54). The cells were cultured in 
DMEM supplemented with 10% plasma-derived fetal bovine serum (PDS), 
10 ng/ml EGF, and 5 ng/ml PDGF (R&D Systems Inc.). Cells were pas￾saged by trypsinization and used at the third to fifth passage after primary 
culture. After plating as indicated, the cells were allowed to grow until they 
were 85% confluent before being used in the indicated experiments.
mRNA analysis by quantitative RT-PCR. For quantitative mRNA analysis, 
total RNA was isolated from lung tissue or fibroblasts. Primer Express 2.0 
software (Applied Biosystems) was used to design TaqMan primers and 
MGB probes (6-FAM conjugated) for α-SMA, which were then purchased 
from Applied Biosystems. The primer and probe sequences for α-SMA were 
as follows: forward, 5′-CAACAGGATGAAGACTGCAACCT-3′; reverse, 5′-
GGGACCATCAGCTAAAGAAG-3′; probe, 5′-6FAM-CCCTTCTCATCT￾GCGTCT-3′. Primers and probe for GAPDH were purchased from Applied 
Biosystems. For each assay, 100 ng total RNA was used as template. 
GAPDH mRNA was used as internal control to normalize the amount of 
input RNA. One-step real-time RT-PCR (48°C for 30 minutes, 95°C for 10 
seconds, followed by 45 cycles of 95°C for 10 seconds and 60°C for 1 min￾utes) was performed with TaqMan One Step RT-PCR Master Mix (Applied 
Biosystems) using a GeneAmp 7500 Sequence Detection System (Applied 
Biosystems). Results were expressed as 2–ΔΔCT as previously described (56).
Western blotting analysis. Western blotting to detect α-SMA and type I col￾lagen protein expressions were performed as previously described (57). 
Briefly, 5 μg (α-SMA) and 50 μg (type I collagen) of cell extract proteins 
were loaded and separated by 12% and 8% SDS-PAGE, respectively. Mouse 
anti–α-SMA (Sigma-Aldrich) and rabbit anti–type I collagen (Biodesign 
International) antibodies were used as primary antibodies, and HRP￾labeled anti-mouse and anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Biosciences) were used 
as secondary antibodies. The immunostained bands were visualized using 
a chemiluminescent substrate (Cell Signaling Technology) followed by 
exposure to ECL Hyperfilm (Amersham Biosciences). The films were then 
scanned and quantitated using 1D Image Analysis software (Kodak).
Telomerase activity assay (TRAP-based ELISA). Telomerase activity was 
assayed using a telomerase PCR ELISA kit (Roche) in accordance with the 
manufacturer’s protocols. Briefly, cell extracts were prepared by lysing the 
cultured fibroblasts with ice-cold lysis reagent. The protein concentrations 
were determined by the method of Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad Laborato￾ries) and stored at –80°C until assayed. For each sample, 0.5 μg total cell 
protein was added to 25 μl reaction mixture containing telomerase sub￾strate, including the biotin-labeled P1-TS and P2 primers, as well as nucleo￾tides, Taq polymerase, and sterile water to a final volume of 50 μl. These 
mixtures were transferred to a PTC-200 DNA Engine thermal cycler (MJ 
research Inc.) for primer elongation at 25°C for 25 minutes, telomerase 
inactivation at 94°C for 5 minutes, and 30 cycles of amplification (94°C 
for 30 seconds, 50°C for 30 seconds, and 72°C for 90 seconds). Heat treat￾ment of the cell extracts at 80°C for 10 minutes prior to the TRAP reaction 
was used as negative control. The positive control (human kidney 293 cells) 
was supplied by the assay kit. The PCR product (5 μl) was denatured and 
hybridized to a digoxigenin-labeled telomeric repeat–specific probe on the 
precoated microtiter plates at 37°C for 2 hours with shaking (300 rpm). 
Finally, anti-digoxigenin peroxidase conjugate and TMB substrate were 
used for ELISA assay, and the absorbance at 450 nm (with a reference wave 
length of 630 nm) was measured using an ELx 800 UV universal microplate 
reader (Bio-Tek Instruments Inc.). Based on the negative controls, samples 
with absorbance values less than 0.25 were considered negative.
HYP assay. Lung collagen deposition was estimated by measuring the 
HYP content of whole-lung homogenates as previously described (58). 
Briefly, the lungs were excised, homogenized in 0.5 M acetic acid, and 
hydrolyzed in 6N HCl overnight at 110°C. HYP was assessed by colorimet￾ric assay, and the results were expressed as μg HYP per lung.
Cell proliferation assay. Isolated fibroblasts from BLM- and saline-treated 
TERT–/– and WT mice (cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% PDS, 
10 ng/ml EGF, and 5 ng/ml PDGF) were passaged once and then plated 
into 96-well plate at a density of 1 × 104 cells/well in a final volume of 
100 μl medium. When the cells reached approximately 85% confluency 
on the next day, 10 μl WST-1 reagent (1:10 final dilution, WST-1 Cell 
Proliferation Kit II; Roche) was added to each well. After an additional 
4 hours of incubation, cell proliferation was determined by measuring

the absorbance at 450 nm with reference wavelength of 690 nm using an 
ELx 800 UV Universal microplate reader. Only absorbance readings in the 
linear range (0.4–1.5) were used. The cells treated with 10 ng/ml PDGF 
were used as positive controls.
Induction and detection of cell apoptosis. The fibroblasts were plated into 
4-well chamber slides (Nalge Nunc International), with a cell density of 
5 × 103 cells/well, and allowed to reach subconfluence. Serum deprivation 
was achieved by maintenance in DMEM with 0.5% PDS for 24 hours. Apop￾tosis was induced by treating cells with 5 ng/ml TNF-α (R&D Systems) 
and 500 ng/ml CHX (Sigma-Aldrich) for 4 hours. Apoptosis was evalu￾ated using TUNEL assay for in situ detection of apoptotic cells using the 
ApopTag Plus Fluorescein In Situ Apoptosis Detection Kit (Chemicon). 
After induction of apoptosis, cells were washed with PBS, fixed with 1% 
paraformaldehyde for 10 minutes at room temperature, and labeled by 
TUNEL in accordance with the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, after fixa￾tion, cells were labeled for 60 minutes at 37°C using terminal deoxynucleo￾tidyl transferase. The reaction was terminated in stop/wash buffer for 10 
minutes at room temperature. The cells were then incubated with an anti￾digoxigenin conjugate for 30 minutes at room temperature. Nuclei were 
labeled with PI. The cells were observed under a fluorescence microscope. 
For each slide, the number of positive cells were counted in randomly cho￾sen, noncontiguous, high-power fields (original magnification, ×400) until 
a minimum of 500 total cells was counted.
Additionally, annexin V–FITC–PI staining (TACS annexin V–FITC; 
R&D Systems) was performed for early apoptosis detection. Briefly, the 
mouse lung fibroblasts were plated in 60-mm dishes with a cell density 
of 5 × 105 cells/dish. The cell were treated as described above with TNF-α
and CHX for 4 hours and then collected after trypsinization, washed with 
ice-cold PBS, resuspended in 100 μl annexin V incubation reagent (10 μl 
10× binding buffer, 10 μl PI, 1 μl annexin V–FITC, and 79 μl dH2O) at a 
concentration of 3–5 × 105 cells/100 μl, and incubated for 15 minutes at 
room temperature in the dark. Samples were washed with binding buffer 
and analyzed by FACSCalibur (BD). Apoptotic cells were identified as an 
annexin V–FITC–positive/PI-negative population.
Single-cell gel electrophoresis assay. Single and double DNA breaks were eval￾uated using the Comet assay (R&D Systems) in accordance with the manu￾facturer’s manual. Briefly, fresh lung tissue was minced into small pieces in 
1 ml ice-cold PBS (Ca++ and Mg++ free) and 20 mM EDTA and let stand for 
5 minutes. Cell suspension was recovered and pelleted by centrifugation 
and resuspended at 1 × 105 cells/ml in ice-cold PBS. For analysis of primary 
cultured lung fibroblasts, the cells were scraped using a rubber policeman 
and then resuspended in ice-cold PBS at 1 × 105 cell/ml after centrifuga￾tion. The cells were combined with 1% molten low–melting point agarose 
at a ratio of 1:10 (v/v) and immediately pipetted onto a CometSlide. After 
further incubation in the dark to lyse the cells and unwind DNA, the slides 
were subjected to electrophoresis and then treated with SYBR green I for 
viewing the DNA under a fluorescence microscope (Nikon Eclipse E600; 
Diagnostic Instruments Inc.). The cells treated with 400 μM H2O2 for 30 
minutes on ice were used as a positive control.
Generation of BM chimera mice. BM chimeras were prepared as previously 
described (30), with minor modifications. Donor BM cells were collected 
from femurs and tibias of WT and TERT–/– mice by aspiration and flush￾ing. Recipient WT or TERT–/– mice were exposed to 2 doses of 5 Gy given 3 
hours apart using a 137Cs irradiator and then maintained on acidified water 
and autoclaved feed ad libitum. After irradiation, 4 × 106 BM cells from 
donor mice in a volume of 200 μl sterile PBS were injected into recipient 
mice retro-orbitally under anesthesia. Six weeks after durable BM engraft￾ment had been established, pulmonary fibrosis was induced by endotra￾cheal BLM injection as described above.
Statistics. All data were expressed as mean ± SEM unless otherwise indi￾cated. Differences between means of various treatment and control groups 
were assessed for statistical significance by ANOVA followed by post￾hoc analysis using Scheffé’s test for comparison between any 2 groups. 
A P value less than 0.05 was considered significant.
