Does C2 level monitoring have benefit over C0 level monitoring among solid
organ transplantation?

We read the article by Hermann et al. [1] titled “Cyclospor￾ine C0- versus C2-monitoring over three years in main￾tenance heart transplantation” with great interest, in your
most valuable journal. This study focused its message on,
and drew attention to, whether the second hour (C2) blood
levels of cyclosporine (CsA) monitoring has clinical be￾nefit over the measurement of CsA trough levels (C0) in
heart transplant patients. They concluded that, in these re￾cipients, measurement of C2 levels as a standard practice
did not provide an advantage over C0 levels monitoring.
Although CsA is widely used after solid organ transplant￾ation over the long term, there is still no firm consensus
on the best way to monitor CsA blood levels [2]. It is
of interest that Hermann et al. [1] reported no correlation
between C2 levels and creatinine clearance. We agree that
the C2 blood level assay does not have more priority than
C0 level monitoring. Moreover, in spite of the general be￾lief that it is the most sensitive marker for the area under
the curve of drug and it has been planned as a more con￾venient method for pharmacokinetic monitoring than the
usual C0 assay [3, 4], in clinical practice TDM of CsA with
C0 blood levels continue to be routinely used, mainly be￾cause of its simplicity. In fact, C2 blood level measurement
requires obtaining the second blood sample, and hence, it
can lead to non-compliance problems, especially due to in￾terrupted working time during the day. On the other hand,
precise timing of blood samples for C2 values is crucial
when compared to C0 blood levels. Consensus guidelines
suggest that there is a 10-min “window of opportunity” be￾fore and after the 2-hr point in which samples should be
taken [5].
In conclusion, we need a reliable way to monitor CsA ther￾apy because of the adequate blood level of CsA which is
required to prevention of the allograft rejection. Moreover,
unreliability of C2 blood level and simplicity of C0 level
monitoring are the main causes of the decreased practical
popularity of C2 level monitoring, and the benefit of C2
monitoring over trough levels is questioned. We have to
wait to find a faster, simpler, less expensive, more practical
and more accurate method of CsA assays.
