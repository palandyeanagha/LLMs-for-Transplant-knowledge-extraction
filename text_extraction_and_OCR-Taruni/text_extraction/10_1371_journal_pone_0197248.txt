Abstract
Background and aim
Sarcopenic obesity is a risk factor of morbidity and mortality. The aim of this study was to
generate a predictive score of sarcopenia occurrence one year after bariatric surgery.
Patients and methods
We conducted an observational prospective cohort study on a total of 184 severely obese
patients admitted to our institution to undergo sleeve gastrectomy. Skeletal muscle cross￾sectional area at the third lumbar vertebrae (SMA, cm2
) was measured from the routinely
performed computed tomography. The skeletal muscle index (SMI) was calculated as fol￾lows: SMA/height2 (cm2
/m2
). Sarcopenia was defined as an SMI < 38.5 cm2
/m2 for women
and < 52.4 cm2
/m2 for men. Measurements were performed at surgery and one year later.
Results
Most of the included patients were female (79%), with a mean age of 42±0.9 years and body
mass index of 43.2±0.5 kg/m2
. Fifteen patients (8%) had sarcopenia before surgery and 59
(32%) at the one-year follow-up. Male gender (p<0.0001), SMA before surgery (p<0.0001),
and SMI before surgery (p<0.0001) significantly correlated with the occurrence of sarcope￾nia one year after surgery by multivariate analysis. Two predictive sarcopenia occurrence
scores were constructed using SMA and gender (SS1 score) or SMI and gender (SS2
score). The area under receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve of the SS2 score
was significantly greater than that of the SS1 score for the diagnosis of postoperative sarco￾penia occurrence (0.95±0.02 versus 0.90±0.02; p<0.01). A cut-off value for the SS2 score of

0.53 had a sensitivity of 90%, a specificity of 91%, a positive predictive value of 83%, and a
negative predictive value of 95%. In the group of patients without baseline sarcopenia, the
SS2 score had still an excellent AUROC of 0.92±0.02. A cut-off of 0.55 predicted develop￾ment of sarcopenia one year after sleeve gastrectomy in these patients with a sensitivity of
87%, a specificity of 88%, and negative predictive value of 95%.
Conclusion
The SS2 score has excellent predictive value for the occurrence of sarcopenia one year
after sleeve gastrectomy. This score can be used to target early intensification of nutritional
and dietetic follow-up to the predicted high-risk population.
Introduction
Sarcopenia is a pathological disorder characterized by generalized loss of skeletal muscle mass
and function. It is a risk factor of physical disability, impaired quality of life, and death [1, 2].
Sarcopenia is also associated with diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular disease
[3]. Furthermore, sarcopenia is associated with the severity of fibrosis and steatosis, indepen￾dently of metabolic risk factors, in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) [4].
Analysis of single cross-sectional computerized tomography scan (CT-scan) images, acquired
during routine care, is increasingly being used to quantify whole-body muscle mass in vivo.
The skeletal muscle cross-sectional area measured on CT-scan images at the third lumbar ver￾tebrae (SMA, cm2
) is linearly related to whole-body muscle mass [5, 6]. Therefore, SMA nor￾malized for stature, called skeletal muscle index (SMI, cm2
/m2
), is used to predict whole-body
muscle mass. Prado et al. [7] determined sex-specific SMI cut-offs to define sarcopenia in
obese patients with solid tumors of the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts. Men with an
SMI < 52.4 cm2
/m2 and women with an SMI < 38.5 cm2
/m2 are sarcopenic and have a poorer
functional status and higher mortality [7]. These cut-points have further been linked to adverse
outcomes in various populations including the intensive care unit, cancer and liver disease
patients [8–10].
Sarcopenic obesity is defined as the co-presence of sarcopenia and obesity. Its burden is
likely to increase worldwide due to the increasing prevalence of obesity [2, 7, 11]. Bariatric
surgery is an efficient treatment for severe obesity, resulting in significant weight loss and
decreased obesity-associated comorbidity. The repercussions of major weight loss following
bariatric surgery on the onset of sarcopenia or modification of pre-existing sarcopenia are
poorly documented. Furthermore, early instauration of adequate nutritional support in com￾bination with physical activity is a major anabolic stimulus for muscle protein synthesis and
prevention of sarcopenia occurrence [12]. The aim of this study was to define a predictive
score of sarcopenia occurrence in a large observational prospective cohort of severely obese
patients one year after sleeve gastrectomy.
Patients and methods
Study population
We conducted an observational prospective cohort study including consecutive patients
admitted to our institution to undergo sleeve gastrectomy were prospectively included
between January 2013 and January 2014. Patients were eligible for inclusion if they (1) were

severely obese [body mass index (BMI)  35 kg/m2
] with comorbid conditions or morbid obe￾sity alone (BMI  40 kg/m2
) and were not responding to medical treatment; (2) had no medi￾cal or psychological contraindications for bariatric surgery; (3) had no previous bariatric
surgery; (4) had perioperative and postoperative (at one year) evaluation (clinical, biological,
and computed tomography (CT) scan); and (5) were 18 years of age or older. The CT scans
were performed two days and one year after sleeve gastrectomy. All patients underwent a lapa￾roscopic single-port sleeve gastrectomy. Patients were excluded if they did not have a CT scan
between 12 and 18 months after surgery. Written informed consent was obtained from all par￾ticipants. The study did not included minors and was conducted in accordance with the
French law concerning medical investigations (Huriet Law) and the Helsinki declaration. The
study protocol and the consent procedure were approved by the ethics committee of the Bicê￾tre Hospital.
Computed tomography
The skeletal muscle cross-sectional area at the third lumbar vertebrae (SMA, cm2
) was mea￾sured by CT scan according to the method of Prado et al. [7]. The SMA was identified and
quantified using Hounsfield unit thresholds (-29 to +150) [5, 13]. The third lumbar vertebrae
region contains psoas, paraspinal muscles (quadratus lumborum and erectorspinae), and
abdominal wall muscles (external and internalobliques, transversus abdominus, and rectus
abdominus). Measurements were performed by a single reader by delineating the muscle area.
The SMI (cm2
/m2
) was calculated as follows: SMA/[height (m) × height (m)]. Sarcopenia was
defined as a SMI < 38.5 cm2
/m2 for women and < 52.4 cm2
/m2 for men [7]. The fat-free mass
(FFM) was estimated by the following regression equation previously validated by Moutzarkis
et al. [6]: FFM (kg) = 0.3×SMA(cm2
) + 6.06. CT scans were systematically performed two days
and one year after sleeve gastrectomy for early and late surgical complication screening. The
time between the two scans was between 12 and 18 months. The clinical interest of routine
postoperative CT scan was evaluated by our team in a previous study [14]. We showed that a
combination of clinical surveillance and early imaging allowed prompt management of com￾plicated cases, avoiding further morbidity. The potential risks associated with diagnostic medi￾cal radiation should always be considered. Bariatric surgery patients may receive radiation
doses from postoperative radiological exams that could potentially increase their lifetime risk
of cancer. Although the risk to benefit ratio may be justified, strategies to minimize the radia￾tion dose in this patient population should be applied. In our patients, CT scan was performed
on a targeted zone of interest using a limited number of phases, thus considerably decreasing
radiation exposure.
Serum biological markers
The following parameters were assessed prospectively on fresh serum: alanine aminotransfer￾ase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), fasting
blood glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), cholesterol, triglyceride, LDL-cholesterol,
HDL-cholesterol, ferritin, C reactive protein (CRP), hemoglobin, creatinine, and albumin lev￾els, and prothrombin time.
Statistical analysis
Qualitative variables were compared using chi-square and Fisher exact tests, as appropriate.
Student’s t-test was used for comparisons of normally distributed quantitative variables, and
the Mann–Whitney or Kruskal–Wallis test to compare quantitative variables that were not
normally distributed. Quantitative variables are expressed as the mean ± SEM. The Bonferroni

multiple-comparison procedure was used. Univariate analysis of baseline clinico-biological
parameters was carried out for patients developing sarcopenia one year after sleeve gastrec￾tomy versus those who did not. We then identified independent relationships between vari￾ables with a P value < 0.05 by univariate analysis and the presence of sarcopenia one year after
sleeve gastrectomy, through logistic regression analysis. The variables with P < 0.05 by multi￾variate analysis were retained to generate two logistic regression functions for predicting the
occurrence of sarcopenia one year after sleeve gastrectomy, called the SS1 score and the SS2
score. The best index for predicting the occurrence of sarcopenia was a logistic regression func￾tion that combined gender and SMA (SS1 score) or gender and SMI (SS2 score): XB = α+∑βixi
(α = intercept; βi = regression coefficients for xi; xi = explanatory variables). Each model esti￾mates B for a specific group, where Logit (Y) = XB. The group probability score was calculated
by transforming the logit function using Prob(Y = sarcopenia) = 1/(1+Exp(-XB). The probabil￾ity Y of sarcopenia is a value between 0 and 1. The overall diagnostic performance of each sar￾copenia score (SS1 and SS2 scores) was determined using areas under receiver operating
characteristic (AUROC) curves with an empirical nonparametric method, as described by
DeLong et al. [15]. Comparisons were made as described by Zhou et al. [16]. Sensitivity, speci￾ficity, and positive and negative predictive values were calculated. The optimal cut-off values
for each sarcopenia score were determined by maximizing the sum of sensitivity and specific￾ity. We used Number Cruncher Statistical Systems software, version 9.0.14 [17].
Results
Characteristics of the patients
A total of 229 consecutive severely obese patients referred to our hospital for sleeve gastrec￾tomy were evaluated between January 2013 and January 2014. Forty-five patients were
excluded due to an early follow-up evaluation between three and nine months after surgery
(25 patients), loss to follow-up (10 patients), an incomplete evaluation one year after surgery
(eight patients), and death (two patients). Finally, 184 patients were included in the analysis.
The characteristics of the non-included patients were not significantly different. Most of the
included patients were female (79%), the mean age was 42 ± 0.9 years, and the mean BMI was
43.2 ± 0.5 kg/m2 (Table 1). The interval between the two CT scan evaluations was 384 ± 5 days.
Fifteen patients (8%) had sarcopenia at inclusion and 59 (32%) one year after sleeve gastrec￾tomy. Patients having sarcopenia at inclusion were not significantly different from those with￾out sarcopenia in terms of age, BMI, comorbidities or biology parameters. The characteristics
of the included patients are reported in Table 1.
Univariate analysis according to the occurrence of sarcopenia at the one￾year follow-up
We compared the baseline clinico-biological parameters of sarcopenic and non-sarcopenic
patients one year following surgery (Table 2). Patients with sarcopenia at the one-year follow￾up had a lower baseline BMI, SMA, SMI, and calculated FFM. Being male and having sarcope￾nia at baseline were more frequent in the group of sarcopenic than non-sarcopenic patients
one year after sleeve gastrectomy. The other clinico-biological parameters were not signifi￾cantly different between the two groups (Table 2).
Multivariate analysis
A logistic regression model was fitted to test for independent variables (variables with a
p < 0.05 by univariate analyses) at baseline related to the presence of sarcopenia one year after

sleeve gastrectomy (dependent variable). In the first analysis, variables with a p-value < 0.05
by the univariate comparison were introduced into the model: gender, BMI, and SMA. Male
gender independently and positively correlated with sarcopenia (regression coefficient = 8.50;
p < 0.0001) and SMA independently and negatively correlated with sarcopenia (regression
coefficient = -0.11; p < 0.0001). We then replaced the SMA by the SMI in the second logistic
analysis. Independent variables introduced into the model were gender, BMI. and SMI. Male

Construction of SS1 and SS2 sarcopenia scores
A first model combining the SMA at baseline and gender, called the SS1 score, was constructed
by logistic regression. The equation for the SS1 score is: 13.38 + 8.48 × (sex = 1) - 0.11 × SMA
at baseline. R2 (the proportion of variation in the dependent variable accounted for by the
independent variables) = 0.42. A second model combining the SMI at baseline and gender
called the SS2 score was also constructed. The equation for the SS2 score is: 19.64 + 6.84 x
(sex = 1) - 0.42 × SMI at baseline. R2 = 0.55.
Predictive value of SS1 and SS2 scores for sarcopenia occurrence one year
after sleeve gastrectomy
The AUROC of the SS2 score was significantly higher than that of the SS1 score for the predic￾tion of sarcopenia one year after sleeve gastrectomy (0.95 ± 0.02 versus 0.90 ± 0.02; p < 0.01)
(Fig 1). The optimal cut-off for the SS2 score was 0.533. This cut-off predicted the presence of
Fig 1. ROC curves of SS2 and SS1 scores for the prediction of sarcopenia one year after sleeve gastrectomy. The diagonal line represents the
detection achieved by chance alone (AUROC = 0.50); the ideal AUROC is 1.00. The SS1 score takes into account SMA [skeletal muscle cross-sectional
area at the third lumbar vertebrae (cm2
)] and gender. The SS2 score takes into account SMI [skeletal muscle index: SMA/height2 (cm2
/m2
)] and
gender.

sarcopenia one year after sleeve gastrectomy with an excellent sensitivity of 90% and a specific￾ity of 91%, with an excellent negative predictive value (NPV) of 95% and a good positive pre￾dictive value (PPV) of 83% (Table 3).
Predictive value of SS2 score for sarcopenia occurrence one year after sleeve
gastrectomy in patients without baseline sarcopenia
Considering that each of the 15 patients with baseline sarcopenia has kept it one year after sur￾gery, we performed a sensitivity analysis for SS2 score after removing these patients from the
cohort. In univariate analysis, patients developing sarcopenia at one-year follow-up had still a
lower baseline BMI, SMA, SMI and calculated FFM. Being male was more frequent in the
group of sarcopenic than non-sarcopenic patients one year after sleeve gastrectomy. In multi￾variate analysis, male gender still independently and positively correlated with sarcopenia
development (regression coefficient = 6.67; p < 0.0001) and SMI independently and negatively
correlated with sarcopenia development (regression coefficient = -0.41; p < 0.0001). The SS2
score was reconstructed in the group of patients without baseline sarcopenia. The equation of
this new SS2 score is: 19.34 + 6.67 x (sex = 1) - 0.41 × SMI at baseline. The AUROC of SS2 score
(0.92±0.02) was not significantly different in the group of patients without baseline sarcopenia
compared to the entire cohort. The optimal cut-off for the SS2 score in patients without base￾line sarcopenia was 0.55. This cut-off predicted development of sarcopenia one year after
sleeve gastrectomy in patients without baseline sarcopenia with an excellent sensitivity of 87%
and specificity of 88%, with an excellent negative predictive value (NPV) of 95% and a good
positive predictive value (PPV) of 73%.
Discussion
In this study of 184 severely obese patients undergoing sleeve gastrectomy, the SS2 score,
combining gender and skeletal muscle area at the third lumbar vertebrae (transverse CT-scan
section), corrected by high (SMI), showed excellent predictive value for the presence of sarco￾penia one year after surgery, with an AUROC of 0.95. The prevalence of sarcopenia was 8% at
surgery and rose to one third of patients one year after sleeve gastrectomy. Patients with sarco￾penia were more often men, had a lower initial BMI, a lower SMI at surgery, and a higher rate
of initial sarcopenia than patients without sarcopenia (Table 2). All patients with sarcopenia at

of obese sarcopenia is estimated to be 2% for patients aged 60 to 69 years and increases to 10%
for patients aged over 80 years [18]. Eight percent of the patients in our cohort were already
sarcopenic before bariatric surgery, despite a low mean age of only 42 years. Previous studies
showed that age >75 years is significantly associated with sarcopenia in both men and women
[19]. In our cohort, patient age was not an independent predictive factor of sarcopenia occur￾rence one year after surgery. This discrepancy is probably due to the young age of our patients.
We showed here that male gender and baseline SMI were two independent predictive fac￾tors of sarcopenia one year after surgery. These two variables accounted for 55% of the risk of
having sarcopenia. The score that we propose is thus generated from gender and SMI, calcu￾lated from the SMA at L3 by CT scan. The mechanism of gender-associated risk of developing
sarcopenia after bariatric surgery is unknown. In our cohort, males did not differed from
females in term of baseline age, BMI or comorbidities (HTA, diabetes, obstructive sleep
apnea). In rodent models of high-fat diet, males were more prone to the decline of muscle dur￾ing ageing than females [20]. In a cohort of patients with lung cancer, a significantly higher
proportion of men were sarcopenic, according to CT-scan criteria, compared with women
[21]. Nevertheless, association between male gender and sarcopenia development has to be
confirmed in bariatric population.
Sarcopenia was highly associated with a low initial skeletal muscle mass and the magnitude
of weight loss following sleeve gastrectomy. A previous study evaluating body composition
after various types of bariatric surgery showed that the loss of FFM after surgery was indepen￾dent of the initial BMI and the magnitude of weight loss did not correlate with FFM loss [22],
in accordance with our data.
In non-obese patients, sarcopenia is a significant risk factor of frailty, weakness, functional
disability, and institutionalization [23–26]. Moreover, sarcopenic obesity impairs functional
activities and abilities [7, 27, 28]. In a cirrhotic population, the mortality rate reached 36% in
the obesity group, 48% in the sarcopenia group, and 67% in the sarcopenic obesity group [28].
Furthermore, sarcopenic obesity increases the rate of adverse outcomes, including postopera￾tive infections in patients undergoing cardiac surgery (OR: 6.6, 95% CI: 1.7–25.2, p = 0.01)
[27]. The survival of sarcopenic obesity patients was 10.0 months shorter than those who were
not sarcopenic for patients with solid tumors of the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts (HR:
4.2, 95% CI: 2.4–7.2, p < 0.0001) [7]. Although the impact of sarcopenia on long-term progno￾sis in patients with bariatric surgery is unknown, patients with a high risk of developing sarco￾penia should probably be identified early to intensify the nutritional and dietetic follow up.
We propose a simple and accurate method to generate a sarcopenia risk score, with excel￾lent predictive performance, using the SMA measured by CT scan two days and one year after
sleeve gastrectomy for early and late surgical complication screening. A cut-off of 0.533 for the
SS2 score for the prediction of one-year post-surgery sarcopenia had an excellent NPV of 0.95
and a good PPV of 0.83. The SS2 score had similar diagnosis performance even after excluding
patients with baseline sarcopenia. Altogether, these data suggest that the SS2 score is a reliable
tool to select patients at risk of developing sarcopenia after bariatric surgery. As reported in
the literature, the measured SMA correlates with the FFM [5, 7, 13]. DXA is the most com￾monly used imaging technique to measure FFM because of its precision and tolerance by
patients, but it is not widely available [25, 29]. Mitsiopoulos et al. compared arm and leg skele￾tal muscle cross sectional area using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and CT scan with cor￾responding cadaver estimates [13]. Both MRI and CT scan estimates of SMA highly correlated
with the corresponding cadaver values [13]. Shen et al. showed a high correlation between
body composition estimated by whole body multi-slice CT or MRI and single abdominal
Sarcopenia score in severely obese patients

cross-sectional image [5]. The highest correlation between a single slice SMA and total body
skeletal muscle volume was specifically observed 5 cm above the L4-L5 vertebral level [5].
Mourtzaki et al. showed that regional analysis of fat and fat-free tissue at L3, by either DXA or
CT, strongly correlated with whole-body fat and FFM (r = 0.86–0.94; p < 0.001) [6].
Sarcopenia has been defined by Rosenberg et al. as the loss of both muscle mass and func￾tion [30]. Recently the International Working Group on Sarcopenia recommended MRI and
CT scan as “gold standard” imaging techniques to assess sarcopenia [29]. The European Work￾ing Group on Sarcopenia in Older People recommends MRI and CT scan for the measure￾ment of muscle mass to define sarcopenia and the use of cut-off values reported in the
reference studies [2]. Prado et al. validated the sarcopenia diagnosis with the CT measurement
of the skeletal muscle cross-sectional area at L3 [7].
Our study has several limitations. First, the rate of loss to follow up was 20% in this cohort.
The non-interventional character of the study can explain the high proportion of patients lost
to follow-up. Nevertheless, patients were lost to follow up independently of the evolution of
their health and were not significantly different from those who had a one-year post-surgery
evaluation. Second, despite excellent diagnostic performance for predicting the presence of
sarcopenia one year after sleeve gastrectomy, our score needs validation in an independent
external prospective cohort. Third, muscle function tests (such as hand grip strength test) were
not available for our patients. Studies evaluating both muscles mass on CT-scan images and
function are further needed.
In conclusion, the results of our study show that the SS2 score, combining gender and SMI
calculated from SMA at L3 on early postoperative CT scan, is a reliable tool for predicting the
presence of sarcopenia one year after sleeve gastrectomy. The SS2 score should be used to select
patients at risk of developing sarcopenia after bariatric surgery to intensify nutritional inter￾vention. Further studies are necessary to validate this predictive score in an independent pro￾spective external cohort and evaluate its long-term prognostic value.
