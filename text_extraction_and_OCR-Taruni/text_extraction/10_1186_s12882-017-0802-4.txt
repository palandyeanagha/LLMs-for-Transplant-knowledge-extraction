Abstract
Background: C3 glomerulopathy (C3G) is a rare, but severe glomerular disease with grim prognosis. The complex
pathogenesis is just unfolding, and involves acquired as well as inherited dysregulation of the alternative pathway
of the complement cascade. Currently, there is no established therapy. Treatment with the C5 complement
inhibitor eculizumab may be a therapeutic option. However, due to rarity of the disease, parameters predicting
treatment response remain largely unknown.
Methods: Seven patients with C3G (five with C3 glomerulonephritis and two with dense deposit disease) were
treated with eculizumab. Subjects underwent biopsy before enrollment. The histopathology, clinical data, and
response to eculizumab treatment were analyzed. The key parameters to determine outcome were changes of
serum creatinine and urinary protein over time.
Results: After treatment with eculizumab, four subjects showed significantly improved or stable renal function and
urinary protein. A positive response occurred between 2 weeks and 6 months after therapy initiation. One subject
(with allograft recurrent C3 glomerulonephritis) initially showed a positive response, but relapsed when eculizumab
was discontinued, and did not respond after re-initiation of treatment. Two subjects showed impaired renal
function and increasing urinary protein despite therapy with eculizumab.
Conclusions: Eculizumab may be a therapeutic option for a subset of C3G patients. The response to eculizumab is
heterogeneous, and early as well as continuous treatment may be necessary to prevent disease progression. These
findings emphasize the need for studies identifying genetic and functional complement abnormalities that may
help to guide eculizumab treatment and predict response.

Background
C3 glomerulopathy (C3G) is a recent description of a dis￾ease characterized by uncontrolled activation of the alter￾native complement pathway leading to predominantly
glomerular deposition of complement C3 and C3 frag￾ments [1–4] and characteristic histo-pathological features
for membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN).
Based on electron microscopy analysis, C3G can be sub￾classified as dense deposit disease (DDD) and C3 glomer￾ulonephritis (C3GN). A distinction is made to MPGN
caused by immune complex mediated dysregulation of the
classical complement cascade, although both disease spec￾tra share common pathophysiological features [5]. Patients
present with varying levels of urinary protein and/or
hematuria. Concomitant loss of renal function leads to
end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in many cases.
C3G is a rare disease with an estimated incidence of
1–2 cases per million [6]. Renal prognosis is poor with
very few reports of spontaneous remission [7] and a vast
majority of progression to ESRD with rates of up to 50%
within a decade, and recurrence rates of 45–60% in allo￾grafts [8–12]. A cohort study with 80 patients identified
age > 16 years, DDD subtype, and crescentic GN as pre￾dictors for ESRD [6].
Dysregulation of the alternative complement cascade
plays a primary role in the pathogenesis of C3G and

atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS). Uncon￾trolled activation of the alternative complement pathway
is driven by inherited mutations in complement proteins
and cofactors (e.g. C3, CFB, CFH, CFI, CFHR1–5), or by
acquired defects (e.g. CFH, CFB, C3 convertase autoanti￾bodies) [13–16]. While aHUS results from dysregulation
of complement factors on cell surfaces (the ‘solid phase’)
[17] leading to global endothelial damage, C3G seems to
occur after activation of the alternative complement
pathway in the fluid phase [14, 15, 18].
In contrast to immune complex mediated MPGN,
which is managed by treating underlying infections,
autoimmune diseases, or cancer, treatment strategies in
the setting of C3G are still evolving. So far, no generally
effective treatment has been identified [19]. Treatment
of C3G with immunosuppression (e.g. calcineurin inhibi￾tors, cyclophosphamide, mycophenolate mofetil, or ri￾tuximab) [9, 20–23], plasma infusion [24], or
plasmapheresis [25] has been described in small cohorts
with inconclusive results. With the emerging role of
complement in C3G, complement-modulating agents
have added new therapeutic options. Eculizumab is a
monoclonal humanized antibody that binds C5 and
prevents assembly of the membrane attack complex
(C5b-9) thereby blocking the final complement cas￾cade. Several case reports and one open-label study
showed a potential benefit of eculizumab for patients
with C3G [22, 26–39].
In this study, we characterize clinical and pathological
features of seven patients with C3G (five with C3GN,
two with DDD), evaluate their treatment response to
eculizumab, and discuss critical features of their individ￾ual therapeutic outcome.
Methods
Data were collected from medical records. Inclusion
criteria were age > 18 years, histopathological diagno￾sis of C3G, and treatment with eculizumab (Soliris;
Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Cheshire, CT). Seven pa￾tients (five with C3GN, two with DDD) treated with
eculizumab between 2013 and 2016 for C3G were en￾rolled in the study. Data were collected from the time
of treatment initiation until last follow-up. Outcome
measurements were change of kidney function, and
urinary protein over time.
Positive treatment response was defined as >30% de￾crease of serum creatinine, urinary protein, or hematuria
after 3 months of treatment. Stable disease was defined
as serum creatinine, urinary protein, or hematuria be￾tween ±30% after 3 months of treatment. Negative treat￾ment response was defined as increase >30% of serum
creatinine, urinary protein, or hematuria after 3 months
of treatment.
Treatment with Angiotensin converting enzyme inhib￾itors (ACEI), or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) was
administered to all patients for blood pressure control
and reduction of urinary protein. However, disease pro￾gression warranted for specific treatment in all patients.
All patients gave informed consent for eculizumab
treatment. The study was approved by the Ethics Com￾mittee of the University Medical Center, Freiburg,
Germany. Before eculizumab administration, all patients
received meningococcal vaccinations. Eculizumab was
given according to aHUS standard treatment protocol
[40]. Briefly, eculizumab was administered weekly at a
dose of 900 mg (week 1–4), followed by eculizumab
every other week at a dose of 1200 mg (from week 5).
No serious side effects were reported. Serum creatinine
and urinary protein levels were monitored regularly. Ref￾erence ranges for serum creatinine levels were defined
for men as 0.84–1.25 mg/dl, for women as 0.66–
1.09 mg/dl. Reference ranges for urinary protein were
defined as <0.15 g/g. Due to the small study population,
no statistical analysis was performed. Data are presented
for each individual case.
Results
Patient characteristics
The report includes five patients (all white Caucasians)
with C3GN (two males and three females) and two pa￾tients with DDD (both female, Table 1). Three patients
had recurring allograft C3G. One patient was diagnosed
with de novo allograft C3GN after kidney transplantation
with ESRD due to focal segmental glomerulosclerosis
(FSGS). Four patients received immunosuppressive agents
prior to eculizumab with varying success. The mean age at
diagnosis was 29 years (range = 14–59 years). At diagnosis
all subjects had either impaired renal function (mean
serum creatinine 2 mg/dl; range = 0.8–3.3 mg/dl) and/or
elevated levels of urinary protein (urinary protein to cre￾atinine ratio [UPCR] 3.6 g/g; range = 0.3–5.4 g/g). All pa￾tients presented with varying levels of hematuria.
Course of C3G disease
Patient C3GN1 was diagnosed with C3GN in his/her late
thirties, 4 years after receiving an allogenic kidney trans￾plant (baseline creatinine 1.6 mg/dl post transplantation;
immunosuppression with tacrolimus, MMF [mycophe￾nolate mofetil], and prednisone) due to ESRD of MPGN
(initial diagnosis 11 years earlier with classification as
MPGN type I). The patient presented with elevated
levels of serum creatinine (1.9 mg/dl), urinary protein
(5–6 g/g), and hematuria. The kidney biopsy revealed
discrete glomerular fibrosis, mesangial hypercellularity,
lymphocyte infiltration, and pronounced C3 staining in
accordance with C3GN (Table 2). Complement assays
showed complement activation with low C3 levels
Welte et al. BMC Nephrology (2018) 19:7 Page 2 of 10

(Additional file 1: Table S2). Additionally, C3 convertase
autoantibodies were detected (C3 nephritic factors,
C3NeF; Table 2). Immunosuppression was maintained
with prednisone, tacrolimus, and MMF. One-time ad￾ministration of rituximab did neither affect creatinine
levels nor urinary protein. Treatment with eculizumab
over 27 months maintained stable kidney transplant
function (serum creatinine levels of 1.6–2.2 mg/dl),
greatly improved urinary protein (0.2–0.4 g/g), and led
to stable hematuria (Fig. 1a). Complement testing at
week 17 and 43 of treatment suggested effective comple￾ment blockade (CH50 < 10 IE/ml, ref. range 20–50 IE/
ml; Additional file 1: Table S2).
Patient C3GN2 with a history of HIV infection
(HAART had been successfully applied to control
HIV infection) presented with serum creatinine
levels of 2.3 mg/dl, urinary protein levels of 0.3 g/g,
and hematuria in his/her early forties. Kidney biopsy
revealed global mesangial and endocapillary hyper￾cellularity with discrete glomerular sclerosis. Im￾munofluorescence and electron microscopy revealed
distinct C3 deposition with little to no immuno￾globulin deposition (Table 2) leading to the diagnosis
of C3GN. Complement analysis showed increased C3
turnover and sMAC formation (Additional file 1:
Table S3). Antibody and genetic testing showed no
pathologic mutations, but identified antibodies
against C3NeF, C3b, and CFH (Table 2). Eculizumab
treatment resulted in an improvement of renal func￾tion with slightly improved serum creatinine levels at
1.2–1.7 mg/dl and low range urinary protein (0.1–
0.2 g/g; Fig. 1b). Notably, a short interruption of
eculizumab treatment for 12 weeks led to a dramatic
increase of urinary protein (maximum urinary pro￾tein levels 1.8 g/g), worsened renal function (max￾imum serum creatinine levels 2.2 mg/dl), and
enhanced sMAC formation (maximum sMAC levels
914 ng/dl). Re-initiation of eculizumab promptly re￾duced urinary protein (0.1–0.3 g/g), restored kidney
function (serum creatinine levels 1.4–1.8 mg/dl), and
improved hematuria.
Patient C3GN3 presented with relapsing C3GN in his/
her mid-thirties, 3 months after receiving allogenic kid￾ney transplantation (post transplantation creatinine
1.5 mg/dl; immunosuppression with tacrolimus, MMF,
and prednisone) due to ESRD of C3GN (initial diagnosis

7 years earlier). Previous treatment approaches included
prednisone, MMF, and azathioprine. The patient pre￾sented with elevated serum creatinine (2.1 mg/dl),
discrete urinary protein (0.3 g/g), and hematuria (Add￾itional file 1: Table S4). Transplant kidney biopsy re￾vealed no signs of graft rejection, but showed mesangial
proliferation, lymphocyte infiltration and predominant
C3 staining without immunoglobulin deposition (Table 2).
Electron microscopy confirmed relapsing C3GN.
Antibody and genetic testing revealed neither autoanti￾bodies nor pathophysiological relevant mutations in any
of the known disease genes (Table 2). Notably a heterozy￾gous variant change of questionable pathophysiological
relevance in exon 17 of C3 was detected (detailed dis￾cussion Additional file 1: Text S1). Treatment with
eculizumab stabilized kidney function (serum creatin￾ine 1.9–2.2 mg/dl), urinary protein (0.25–0.35 g/g),
and hematuria (Fig. 1c). Immunosuppression was

maintained with prednisone, tacrolimus, and MMF.
Of note, eculizumab had to be paused for 4 weeks
due to immunosuppression-induced agranulocytosis.
Patient DDD1 presented in his/her early twenties with
impaired renal function (serum creatinine 1.5 mg/dl),
nephrotic range urinary protein (5.7 g/g), and hematuria.
Complement analysis showed activation of the alternative
pathway and high sMAC levels (Additional file 1:
Table S5). A kidney biopsy at the department of
pediatric nephrology 10 years before had shown
mesangial proliferation, and prominent C3 staining
with little immunoglobulin staining. Electron micros￾copy confirmed DDD (Table 2). Antibody analysis and
genetic testing identified neither autoantibodies
against C3NeF, nor pathophysiological relevant muta￾tions in CFH (Table 2). Treatment with eculizumab
stabilized kidney function (serum creatinine 1.1–
1.3 mg/dl) and initially improved urinary protein
(2.2–2.7 g/g). Hematuria levels significantly decreased.
However, urinary protein deteriorated after 87 weeks
of therapy (3.0–3.7 g/g) (Fig. 1d). Blood pressure was
carefully controlled and within normal range.

Patient C3GN4 presented with de novo C3GN at the
in his/her early twenties. He had received a kidney trans￾plant due to FSGS with ESRD 10 years earlier. In line
with the initial diagnosis of FSGS an immunosuppressive
therapy with prednisone, cyclosporine, and cyclophos￾phamide had been administered. One month following
kidney transplantation, the patient had been successfully
treated with cyclophosphamide and plasmapheresis due
to relapsing FSGS [41]. 11 years after transplantation, la￾boratory testing showed a gradual loss of transplant
function with elevated serum creatinine (3.3 mg/dl),
prominent urinary protein (3.4 g/g), and hematuria.
Transplant kidney biopsy revealed glomerular sclerosis,
mesangial and endocapillary proliferation. Immunofluor￾escence and electron microscopy confirmed the diagno￾sis of de novo C3GN (Table 2; C3GN4, 1st biopsy).
Further analysis showed activation of the alternative
pathway and a weakly positive C3NeF (Additional file 1:
Table S6). Genetic testing revealed heterozygous changes
of unknown clinical significance in CFI and COL4A3
(Table 2, detailed discussion Additional file 1: Text S2).
Immunosuppression after kidney transplantation was
maintained with prednisone, tacrolimus, and MMF.
After administration of eculizumab, kidney transplant
function and urinary protein greatly improved. Serum
creatinine levels stabilized at 1.6–1.8 mg/dl and urinary
protein levels at 1 g/g. However after 3 months of treat￾ment, eculizumab was stopped due to lack of compli￾ance. 1.5 years later the patient presented again with
relapsing disease, serum creatinine levels of 3 mg/dl, and
urinary protein of 4.3 g/g. A second kidney biopsy
showed progressing glomerular sclerosis, and immuno￾fluorescence revealed complement deposition but no
IgG. (Table 2; C3GN4, 2nd biopsy). Treatment with eculi￾zumab was reapplied. Hematuria levels remained stable,
however serum creatinine and urinary protein levels fur￾ther increased, and treatment with eculizumab was dis￾continued after 3 months (Fig. 2a).
Patient DDD2 presented with elevated serum creatin￾ine levels (2.1 mg/dl), nephrotic range urinary protein
(5.4 g/g), and hematuria at the in his/her late fifties
(Additional file 1: Table S7). Kidney biopsy displayed
mesangial proliferation, lymphocyte infiltration, and
discrete glomerular sclerosis. Immunofluorescence
showed distinct C3 staining with little immunoglobulin
staining. Electron microscopy found dense deposits in
accordance with DDD (Table 2). Further diagnostic
workup revealed alternative pathway complement activa￾tion but no autoantibodies against C3NeF and CFH.
Genetic analysis detected a heterozygous missense vari￾ant in CFHR5 (Table 2, detailed discussion in Additional
file 1: Text S3). Treatment with eculizumab was initiated
stabilizing kidney function at serum creatinine levels of
2 mg/dl and urinary protein levels of 2 g/g. However, in
the following months kidney function and urinary pro￾tein deteriorated. Thus, treatment with eculizumab was
terminated and dialysis was initiated (Fig. 2b).
Patient C3GN5 presented in his/her mid-teens with
nephrotic range urinary protein (5.6 g/g), normal renal
function (serum creatinine levels 0.8 mg/dl), and hematuria.
Kidney biopsy showed pronounced glomerular sclerosis,
mesangial proliferation, and distinct C3 staining with little
immunoglobulin deposition. Electron microscopy con￾firmed the diagnosis of C3GN (Table 2, C3GN5, 1st and 2nd
biopsy). Complement analysis revealed extensive activation
of the alternative pathway with low C3 levels (Additional
file 1: Table S8). Antibody and genetic testing detected
C3NeF, but no mutation in known disease genes (Table 2).
Treatment with plasmapheresis, plasma infusion, prednis￾one, and MMF had initially induced reduction of urinary
protein (details published in [25]). Due to deterioration of
urinary protein (5.6 g/g) eculizumab therapy was initiated.
With the initiation of eculizumab, MMF was stopped but
was readministered after 2.5 months since urinary protein
increased. A follow-up biopsy after 1 year of eculizumab
treatment revealed glomerular IgG, and κ light chain de￾position with identical staining pattern for mouse anti￾bodies (Table 2, C3GN5, 2nd biopsy). Since eculizumab is a
humanized monoclonal antibody with human IgG2/IgG4
heavy and κ light chain, and mouse variable regions [42],
this glomerular antibody deposition may reflect eculizu￾mab. A break of 17 weeks due to insurance payment nego￾tiations led to a dramatic increase of urinary protein
(> 15 g/g) and decline of renal function. Reinitiation of
eculizumab could not halt disease progression (Fig. 2c).
Discussion
We analyzed data of five patients with C3GN and two
patients with DDD treated with eculizumab. The study
population included patients with atypical history (pa￾tient C3GN2 had a history of HIV infection, patient
C3GN4 presented with de novo C3GN in the kidney
graft, and patient DDD2 presented in his/her late fifties).
We observed heterogeneous treatment response (Table
1): Four patients showed either improved or stable kid￾ney function, and three patients did not respond. These
latter cases also involved patient C3GN4 who initially
responded to eculizumab but showed disease progres￾sion in the second treatment attempt. Treatment re￾sponse varied between 2 weeks and 6 months. This is in
line with published literature as previous studies also re￾ported varying response rates (Additional file 1: Table
S1); [22, 26–39], although published literature shows a
clear publication bias towards positive results. Our study
supports that eculizumab can be a successful treatment
option for at least some patients with C3G.
Although the numbers are small, this study indicates
that timing and duration of treatment seem to be

important factors for the effectiveness. As described in
patient C3GN2, short treatment breaks may result in re￾versible loss of kidney function and urinary protein,
while longer breaks (patients C3GN4 and C3GN5) can
result in disease progression, deterioration of kidney
function, and treatment resistance. This is in line with
recent publications showing that treatment brakes may
result in relapsing disease [39, 43]. Our study also sup￾ports the notion that eculizumab is less likely to improve
disease outcome in patients with more severe glomerular
sclerosis and interstitial fibrosis. Especially patient
C3GN4, who initially was successfully treated with eculi￾zumab showed pronounced renal damage (> 50% glom￾erular sclerosis and IF/TA 25%) after a treatment break
of 1.5 years, and resuming eculizumab treatment did not
halt progression. In several studies, old age, renal impair￾ment at presentation, and severe glomerular pathology
were identified as predictors of ESRD in patients with
C3G [6, 44]. While kidney biopsies provide important
clues, systematic evaluation schemes are needed and
correlation to treatment response and clinical outcome
should be evaluated.
Several markers have been investigated that may help
to evaluate efficacy of eculizumab. sMAC levels have
been suggested as serum marker for the activity of the
alternative complement pathway and treatment response
to eculizumab [28]. However, several C3G cases have
been reported with normal pre-treatment sMAC levels
[5, 28, 36], and in several reports treatment response of
C3G patients was heterogeneous without correlation to
pre-treatment sMAC levels or the course of sMAC
levels during eculizumab treatment [28, 29, 36]. In gen￾eral, this questions sMAC levels as a treatment param￾eter. Further studies with detailed complement analyses
are needed to guide therapeutic interventions.
Interestingly, we observed controlled hematuria in our
collective. Two patients (C3GN2 and DDD1) with de￾cline in hematuria also paralleled improved kidney func￾tion suggesting reduced glomerular inflammation. A
recent study also reported improved creatinine and par￾tial reduction of hematuria in seven pediatric patients
treated with eculizumab for DDD [36]. But, in two pa￾tients with deteriorating kidney function, hematuria par￾tially receded (DDD2 and C3GN5). Additional research

is needed to define clinical parameter for treatment re￾sponse in C3G patients.
Of note, high range urinary protein might also lead to
accelerated renal elimination of eculizumab and there￾fore weaken treatment response to eculizumab since
therapeutic drug levels might not be maintained. In
these cases, careful evaluation of complement activity
such as CH50 as an indicator of total complement activ￾ity or eculizumab serum concentrations might be helpful
in order to detect possible underdosing.
In contrast to aHUS, where eculizumab represents a
successful therapy [40], response rates in C3G patients
are heterogeneous. C3G and aHUS share uncontrolled
activation of the alternative complement pathway and
pathophysiological key regulators, such as mutations in
complement factors or autoantibodies. However, the two
diseases display fundamental differences: In aHUS, com￾plement activation occurs on endothelial surfaces, lead￾ing to endothelial damage and thrombus formation. In
C3G, complement activation occurs predominantly in
the fluid phase resulting in excess formation of activated
C3 and cleavage products, which are deposited in the
kidney and raise glomerular damage [44]. Despite
eculizumab-driven blockage of the terminal complement
cascade, upstream C3 cleavage products may cause con￾tinuing glomerular damage. This provides reasons for di￾verging response rates to eculizumab in aHUS and C3G.
Therefore, further studies evaluating other complement
inhibitors such as the emerging group of C3-convertase
inhibitors are needed. In this context, genetic and im￾munologic screening with registration of relevant muta￾tions, such as the CFHR5 genotype of patient DDD2 in
C3G databases, is crucial for understanding the patho￾physiology and correlating genetic features with treat￾ment response.
Since treatment with eculizumab in C3G patients as
well as in aHUS likely needs to be maintained lifelong,
long-term effects such as glomerular eculizumab depos￾ition as seen in patient C3GN5 and a previous study [45]
have to be monitored. In this regard, the follow-up
periods of this study as well as published literature
(Additional file 1: Table S1) are too short to draw
conclusions.
The time to allograft recurrence in the two reported
patients varies widely (in patient C3GN1 disease repalsed
after 3 years, and in patient C3GN3 after 3 months), which
is in line with previous reports [12]. Rituximab has been
discussed as a treatment option in autoantibody positive
transplant recurrent C3G [46]. In our study (patient
C3GN1), it did not affect disease progression and a previ￾ous report showed poor outcome [12]. However, reported
numbers are too small to draw conclusions. As reported
in this and previous studies (Additional file 1: Table S1),
allograft recurrent C3GN can be treated with eculizumab.
As recurrence rates are high, close clinical monitoring is
especially important in this group.
This study has several limitations, the major being the
retrospective character and the lack of standardized
follow-up, including genetic and serologic testing. Also
the multitude of therapeutic approaches prior to therapy
with eculizumab both in this study and published litera￾ture (Additional file 1: Table S1) complicate the inter￾pretation of the clinical course. This is mainly due to the
rarity of C3 glomerulopathy, and consequently under￾lines the need to prospectively collect data of patients
with C3G.
Conclusions
Together, our series and previous case reports suggest
that early diagnosis and continuous treatment might be
necessary to affect the outcome of C3G. Treatment with
eculizumab may be successful in some patients. Pro￾spective long-term studies will be required to identify
parameters that predict response to therapy.
