From the Departments of Surgery and Pediatrics, University of Colorado School of Medicine and 
Veterans Administration Hospital, Denver, Colorado; and the Department of Pathology, 
St. Mary's Hospital and Medical School, London, England 
UNTIL last year, the kidney was the only 
organ which had been transplanted with 
subsequent significant prolongation of life. 
There had been nine reported attempts at 
orthotopic liver transplantation; seven in 
Denver 22+23 and one each in Bostonle 
and Pari~.~ Two of these patients had suc￾cumbed within a few hours after opera￾ti~n,~, 22 and none had lived for longer than 
23 days. 
This dismal picture has changed within 
the last 9 months, inasmuch as seven con￾secutive patients treated with orthotopic 
liver transplantation from July 23, 1967 to 
March 17, 1968 all passed through this 
previously lethal operative and postopera￾tive period. Three of the recipients are still 
alive after 9, 23$, and 1 months; the others 
died after 2, 3%, 454, and 6 months. 
Methods 
The Recipients. Summary information 
for the seven patients is given in Table 1. 
Their ages were 13 months to 16 years. Six 
were females. The indications for trans￾plantation, which had been established by 
earlier explorations at other hospitals, were

extrahepatic biliary atresia in five cases and 
liver cell carcinoma in the other two. The 
clinical condition of the recipients ranged 
from fair to moribund. The sickest was Pa￾tient 5 who had required repeated para￾centeses for several weeks before admis￾sion and who, as a complication of this 
procedure, had developed a continuously 
draining lower abdominal peritoneal fis￾tula that did not close until a week after 
transplantation. When the patient arrived 
in Denver, examination revealed renal fail￾ure with oliguria, proteinuria, and a blood 
urea nitrogen (BUN) of 70 mg./100 ml. 
A few hours before operation massive gas￾trointestinal hemorrhage developed, prob￾ably from esophageal varices. The bleeding 
continued until after the transplantation 
had been completed. 
This child and the other four with extra￾hepatic biliary atresia had preoperative 
serum bilirubin concentration of 16.1 to 
30.9 mg./100 ml. and alkaline phosphatase 
levels of 88 to 632 international units (nor￾mal 50 to 150). Other biochemical mea￾sures of hepatic metabolism were typical 
of this diseasel4> ls with retention of mod￾erately good synthetic function. For exam￾ple, the prothrombin values ranged from 
50 to 100% of normal and the total serum 
proteins were 6.5 to 7.9 gm./100 ml. The 
patients had ascites and all 5 had some evi￾dence of pulmonary arteriovenous shunt-

FIG. 2. Core cooling of cadaveric liver used for 
infant donors. Immediately after entering the ab￾domen, the cannula is placed into the readily ac￾cessible superior mesenteric vein. This vessel is far 
enough away from the portal triad so that the 
portal vein, which will ultimately be used for 
anastomosis, is not in danger of injury. Egress of

the suprahepatic inferior vena cava. Bile is washed

lecular weight dextran, through a cannula 
inserted into the superior mesenteric vein 
(Fig. 2). With the latter method, egress 
for the fluid was provided by incising the 
inferior vena cava. In order to prevent 
autolysis the gallbladder was opened at its 
dome and irrigated with saline to remove 
all bile. 
The aorta was removed in continuity 
with the hepatic artery (or arteries). It 
was rapidly exposed and mobilized by lift￾ing the spleen and left transverse colon into 
the wound (Fig. 3), opening the plane be￾tween the pancreas and left kidney, divid￾ing the left renal vein, incising the crura 
of the diaphragm, and ligating and divid￾ing all branches except the superior mes￾enteric artery and the celiac axis. The su￾perior mesenteric artery was spared until 
it could be proved that it did not give rise 
to part of the hepatic arterial supply. 
The rest of the procedure was essentially 
the same as that originally described 22 ex￾cept that the cannulated superior mesen￾teric vein was retained with the specimen; 
this necessitated ligation of the splenic vein 
and several other tributaries beneath the 
neck of the pancreas. In 2 cases with 
anomalies, a small right hepatic artery was 
found directly posterior to the portal vein 
and traced back to its origin from the su￾perior mesenteric artery. The latter vessel 
was ligated distal to this point (Fig. 4C). 
During the final stages of excision, a can￾nula was inserted into the distal aorta and 
used to flush the arterial tree with balanced 
electrolyte solution. In all but Case 2, the 
hon~ografts were then inserted into a pres￾ervation unit for one to several hours. The 
preservation was with the combined tech￾nics of hypothermia, hyperbaric oxygena￾tion, and low flow perfusion of both portal 
and arterial systems with diluted homolo￾gous blood of a compatible red cell type. 
The total flow rates (6 ml./Gm, liver/hour), 
temperature (4" C.), times of chamber de￾compression, and other methodologic de￾tails were exactly the same as reported ear￾lier in dog experiments2 When the speci￾mens were subsequently removed from the 
chamber, the vessels were recut according 
to the requirements for their anastomoses. 
Recipient Operation. In six of the seven 
patients, the operation was not begun until 
the homograft was in the chamber and had 
been checked for defects under conditions 
of perfusion. A large transverse abdominal 
incision was used. The most difficult step 
was excision of the recipients' diseased 
livers since extensive upper abdominal ad￾hesions and portal hypertension were pres￾ent. In the patients with biliary atresia, the 
removed organs weighed 665 to 885 grams, 
The liver from the 19-month-old child with 
hepatoma weighed 1,185 Gm.; the liver and 
hepatoma in the 16-year-old girl weighed 
2,575 grams. In all but Case 7, the en￾larged spleens were removed after the 
homografts had been placed.

FIG. 3. Mobilization of the aorta during donor 
hepatectomy. Rapid identification and ligation of 
the branches is facilitated if variable traction is 
applied to the distal aorta. During the initial dis￾section, all the aortic branches except the coeliac 
axis and superior mesenteric artery are ligated and 
divided; the latter vessel is cut only after it has 
been shown not to give rise to an anomalous 
hepatic arterial branch. 
The transplantations were performed with 
the previously described techni~,~"ith the 
exception of some important details. Biliary 
drainage was provided by cholecystoduo￾denostomy (Fig. 4) instead of choledocho￾choledochostomy. Another extremely sig￾nificant change, as recently reported,=O was 
the omission of bypasses to decompress the 
splanchnic and systemic venous systems 
during the anhepatic phase. In the seven 
patients, the portal vein and inferior vena 
cava were simultaneously occluded for 50 
to 90 minutes. The maximum resulting fall 
in arterial blood pressure was 20 mm. Hg. 
The intestines became slightly dusky in 
several cases, but this change was immedi￾ately reversed with the restoration of ve￾nous return. The order of the anastomoses 
was suprahepatic vena caval, infrahepatic 
vena caval, hepatic arterial, and portal ve- - 
nous. In Case 1, the caval clamps were re￾leased after the first 2 anastomoses were 
completed. In the others, no vascular chan￾nels were reopened until at least three, or

Case 2. The right hepatic originated from the su- perior mesenteric artery. C-Anastomosis of the 
homograft aorta to the recipient aorta (Case 5). 
This technic was used because of the double ar- terial supply. 
in two cases, all four vessels had been re￾constructed. 
In five patients, the homograft hepatic 
artery or celiac axis was anastomosed to 
the recipient proper or common hepatic ar￾tery (Fig. 4A). In the other two, a sepa￾rate branch to the right lobe rose from the 
superior mesenteric artery. The first time 
the anomaly was encountered (Case 2), 
the two vessels were individually con￾nected to the right and left branches of 
the recipient proper hepatic artery (Fig. 
4B). The next time (Case S), the distal 
donor aorta was anastomosed end-to-side 
to the upper abdominal aorta of the recipi￾ent (Fig. 4C). Liberation of sufficient re￾cipient aorta above the celiac axis required 
incision of the covering diaphragmatic crus. 
The anterior aortic wall was isolated with 
a partial occlusion clamp during the pe￾riod of suturing. The proximal end of the 
homograft aorta was ligated a few milli￾meters beyond the origin of the celiac axis 
(Fig. 4C).

As will be mentioned later, Patients 13 
had temporary paralysis of the right dia￾phragm. This was thought to have resulted 
from crushing of the right phrenic nerve 
by the vascular clamp which was applied 
to the suprahepatic inferior vena cava. In 
Cases 4-7, a longer cuff was developed and 
care was taken not to include any dia￾phragm in the bite. The complication was 
avoided. 
Intraoperative and Postoperative Man￾agement. Monitoring of metabolic changes 
was facilitated during operation by the use 
of a sampling catheter in the radial artery. 
A continuous intravenous infusion of glu￾cose solution was given at 0.5 to 1 Gm./ 
Kg. per hour during the anhepatic phase. 
Glucose administration was continued post￾operatively. When it was inadvertently 
stopped in one patient for approximately 
20 minutes after return to the recovery 
room, hypoglycemic convulsions resulted. 
Within 2 or 3 days there was no longer 
need for continuous glucose. By this time, 
all the patients had started eating. 
Rapidly developing metabolic acidosis 
was always seen during the anhepatic in￾terval. Data on these changes in the first 
four cases has been publishedz0 and the 
findings in the next three were similar. The 
extent of the acidosis could not be com￾pletely characterized since it was intermit￾tently corrected. In the six infants, sodium 
bicarbonate was infused during the opera￾tion in total doses of 27 to 78 mEq., as 
guided by frequent determinations of ar￾terial pH, COa, and bicarbonate. The 16- 
year-old girl who weighed 39 Kg. received 
290 milliequivalents. 
Before, during, and for several hours 
after transplantation, blood coagulation 
was followed with 11 different tests. These 
provided a measure of fibrinolysins, plate￾lets, six clotting factors produced by the 
liver, and Factor VIII (antihen~aphilic 
globulin) which is extrahepatic in origin. 
These results are being reported separately

Frequent changes in antibiotics were made 
according to the sensitivity of the bacteria 
in these various locations. 
In addition, weekly or biweekly swabs 
from the nasopharynx, throat, rectum, and 
urine were obtained for virus isolation. The 
swabs were immersed in veal infusion broth 
containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin; 0.1 
ml. was inoculated into monolayer cultures 
of human diploid fibroblasts ( WI-38 ) , pri￾mary rhesus monkey kidney cells, and 
H-Ep2 cells. The cultures were observed 
daily for cytopathic effect and tested 
weekly for hemadsorption with guinea pig 
erythrocytes. One blind passage was per￾formed for each specimen in each system. 
The general plan of immunosl~ppressive 
therapy is shown in Figures 5 to 9. Aza￾thioprine, prednisonc and heterologous anti￾lymphocyte globulin 24 were started during 
the operation. The maintenance doses of 
azathioprine were usually less than 1 mg./ 
Kg. per day. In Cases 14 the quantities of 
prednisone were rapidly reduced during 
the first few postoperative weeks (Figs. 
5-7) but in Cases 5-7 the steroid with￾drawal was at a much slower rate (Figs. 
8, 9). The ALG was given daily for the 
first one or 2 weeks and then every second 
or third day. ALG was stopped before the 
end of the planned 4-month course of ther￾apy in Patients 2 and 4 because of the de￾velopment of high titers of precipitating 
antibodies against equine horse protein.12 
Actinomycin C (40 or 60 pg.) was inter￾mittently given to Patients 25 (Figs. 6, 8). 
The homografts of Patients 1-5 were irradi￾ated with 2 or 3 doses of 100 or 150 R 
at depth on alternate days beginning 3 to 
13 weeks post-transplantation (Figs. 5-8). 
The indication for either local x-ray ther￾apy or Actinomycin was rejection.

Pathological Studies. Paraffin sections 
were routinely prepared from all tissues. 
In some instances additional material was 
fixed in Palade's buffered osmium tetroxide 
for subsequent electronmicroscopy and in 
liquid nitrogen for later examination by 
fluorescent antibody methods. The thin sec￾tions for electromicroscopy were stained 
with lead hydroxide and examined in a

and fibrinogen. Appropriate controls were 
also used.

Survival. Patients 2, 3, 4 and 5 died 
133, 186, 60, and 105 days post-transplanta￾tion. The three others are still alive with 
excellent liver function after 269, 68, and 
33 days. 
Two of the deaths (Cases 4 and 5) oc￾curred within a few days after and were 
caused by the septic hepatic infarctions to 
be described below (Fig. 8). The delayed 
consequences of the same complication 
were largely responsible for the unfavor￾able outcome in Cases 2 and 3. 
Technical Complications. The iatrogenic 
right diaphragmatic paralysis in Patients 
1-3 persisted for 10, 7, and 2 weeks. In 
Case 1, failure of the right upper pulmo￾nary lobe to expand prompted its removal 
during the fourth postoperative week (Fig. 
5). The subsequent prevention of operative 
injury to the right phrenic nerve in Cases 
4-7 was mentioned earlier. 
In performing recipient hepatectomy, the 
small bowel in one case and the right trans￾verse colon in another were perforated dur￾ing mobilization of intestinal loops that had 
been caught at the site of previous hilar

well as depression of a number of discrete 
clotting factors produced within or outside 
the liver; these findings are being reported 
in detail elsewhere.Wevertheless, bleeding 
was not a difficult problem. In the infants, 
the estimated blood loss ranged from 460 
to 1,200 ml. (average 790 ml.). The 16- 
year-old girl received 4,000 ml. transfusion, 
almost all as the result of hemorrhage dur￾ing hepatectomy. 
Homograft Sepsis. Two to 104 days after 
transplantation, five of the seven patients 
developed gram negative septicemia with a 
variety of microorganisms including Aero￾hacter-Klebsielln, Escherichia coli, and Bac￾tcroidcs. Bilirubin, alkaline phosphatases, 
serum proteins, and prothrombin times 
were little affccted if at all, but there were 
high rises in the SGOT and SGPT (Figs. 
5-8). Liver scans showed large defects, in￾volving principally the right lobe (Figs. 
10, 11). Each of the patients had devel￾oped a septic hepatic infarct. 
This complication was not easily con￾trolled in spite of specific antibiotic therapy 
and excisions, extraperitoneal debridements 
(Fig. 12), and drainage. Two of the five 
patients died within a few days. The other 
three, who initially survived the compli￾cation of regional hepatic gangrene, had 
a protracted subsequent morbidity. The 
tracts running to the subphrenic space 
(Case 2) or within the liver (Cases 1 and 
3) were irrigated and probed every day. 
They could not be kept sterile in spite of 
local and systemic antibiotics. The same

organisms cultured from the draining 
wounds appeared from time to time in the 
blood stream necessitating reoperation and 
more extensive debridements (Figs. 5-7). 
At these times it was noticed that plugs of 
dead tissue radiated from the main tracts, 
often surrounding thrombosed intrahepatic 
portal triads. Between debridements there 
was variable evidence from the scans that 
filling in of the defects was occurring as 
the consequence of hepatic regeneration 
(Figs. 10, 11). Nevertheless, the open 
wounds never completely healed, even 
after more than 8 months in Case 1. 
Early Liver Function. During the first 
few postoperative days, all seven of the pa￾tients had moderate but rapidly reversible 
rises in SGOT and SGPT. In spite of this 
evidence of ischemic injury, the livers pro￾vided life sustaining function from the be￾ginning. The two recipients with normal 
bilirubin values before operation did not 
become jaundiced within the first post￾operative week and the five patients with 
biliary atresia had rapid partial or com￾plete disappearance of hyperbilirubinemia 
(Figs. 6-9). Alkaline phosphatases de￾creased from 140-632 to 27-165 units dur￾ing the first week. 
All the recipients had a transient fall in 
total serum proteins (Figs. 5-9), the lowest 
value in the first postoperative week being 
3.4 Gm./100 ml. in Case 3. The three chil￾dren with the most severe acute hypopro￾teinemia developed transient peripheraI 
edema which resolved as the serum pro￾teins began to rise. 
The serum protein depression appeared 
to be due at least partly to an increased 
protein loss or heightened catabolisn~,

rather than to a failure of synthesis. The 
plasma levels of Factors I (fibrinogen), I1 
(prothrombin ), V (Accelerator globulin), 
VII (proconvertin), IX (Christmas) and 
X (Stuart) which are manufactured by the 
liver were maintained above 50 to 70% of 
normal in all seven patients from the first 
to the seventh days.9 In addition, Kashi￾wagi et all3 have shown that the identifi￾able protein genotypes haptoglobin and 
group specific component, which are syn￾thesized only in the liver, changed within 
hours to that of the donor. Their studies 
suggested that there was a considerably 
accelerated protein turnover. 
Subsequent Liver Function. Evaluation 
of later function was difficult in all the pa￾tients (Cases 1-5) who developed septic 
hepatic infarctions. A course analogous to 
that seen after canine homotransplantation 
to immunosuppressed recipients 21* 25 was 
seen only in Cases 6 and 7 in which the 
complication of regional hepatic gangrene 
has thus far been avoided. 
Both of the latter two patients appar￾ently had a rejection episode. The first had 
moderate and reversible increases in SGOT, 
SGPT, and alkaline phosphatase but with￾out the recurrence of hyperbilirubinemia 
(Fig. 9). Very similar enzyme changes 
were seen in Case 7 beginning in the sec￾ond postoperative week but in this patient 
the serum bilirubin concomitantly rose to 
6 mg./100 ml. and then began to fall again 
as the SGOT, SGPT, and alkaline phospha￾tases returned toward normal. At these 
times, there was little or no depression in 
either patient in the concentrations of

plasma proteins or of 6 measured clotting 
factors which are synthesized by the liver. 
Changes in SGOT and SGPT had a dif￾ferent significance in the five patients who 
developed regional hepatic gangrene. With 
this complication, the transaminase rises 
were higher and more abrupt (Figs. 54) 
than those associated with rejection and 
they were usually accompanied by minimal 
acute alterations in other measures of liver 
function. In Cases 13 there was little other 
evidence to support the diagnosis of rejec￾tion at that time (Figs. 5-7). DifFicult re￾jections had already occurred in Cases 4 
and 5 but these appeared to have long 
since been reversed at least in terms of 
resolution of jaundice (Fig. S). 
In the three patients who did not die as 
the immediate consequence of septic liver 
infarction, it was difficult to differentiate 
the subsequent adverse effects of this com￾plication from those of chronic rejection. 
The child whose preoperative diagnosis 
was hepatoma (Fig. 5) has had stable ex￾cretory and synthetic hepatic function (in￾cluding nol-mal levels of all siu of the ana￾lyzed liver-based clotting factors) in the 
S months since debridement procedures. 
In contrast, progressive liver failure devel￾oped about 2 months after the septic he￾patic infarctions in Cases 2 and 3 (Figs. 
6 and 7), with jaundice, alkaline phospha￾temia and eventual depression of all stud￾ied plasma proteins. The latter two chil￾dren redeveloped the extensive venous col￾laterals on the abdomen which had been 
present preoperatively and in one of them 
ascites recurred; eventually, homograft 
shrinkage was demonstrated with liver 
scans (Fig. 11). 
Extrahepatic Infections. Five of the 
seven patients had evanescent parahilar or 
lower lobar infiltrations during the early 
course, for which a bacterial or viral eti￾ology could not then be established. Sub￾sequently, Patient 5 persistently had cyto￾megalovirus (CMV) in tracheal excretions 
from postoperative days 75 to 105 at the 
same time as diffuse pneumonitis and 
Asrobactel.-Klebsiella bacteremia developed 
(Fig. 8). At autopsy, there was extensive 
bilateral pneumonia and histologic evi￾dence of lung infestation with bacteria, 
cytomegalovirus, and Pneumocystis carinii. 
In another patient (Case 3) cl~ronic pneu￾monitis was evident radiographically for 
the last 3 months of life. Fungal and viral 
studies of the autopsy specimens have thus 
far been inconclusive. Finally the second 
infant in the series had CMV in tracheal 
secretions on two occasions but never de￾veloped symptoms or abnormalities of her 
chest x-ray. At autopsy, there was no his￾tologic evidence of CMV in the lungs but 
there was moderately severe infestation 
with Pneumocystis carinii. 
Transient fungemia was detected in 
Cases 1, 2, and 4 during the sixth, fourth, 
and first postoperative months. Patients 1 
and 2 were infected with Candida a1bican.s

Other Complications. Concomitant with 
progressive liver failure, and shortly after 
she had been treated with both kanamycin

hyperkalemia. She was resuscitated with

Pathologic Studies. As a result of the 
debridement procedures, homograft tissue 
became available from 8 to 54 days after 
transplantation in Cases 14. A biopsy was 
obtained after 100 days from the liver of 
Patient 1. The homografts of Patients 2, 
3, 4, and 5 were removed at autopsy. 
The pieces of liver removed from Pa￾tients 1-5 at debridement of the right he￾patic lobe all contained multiple infarcts. 
In the necrotic centers of many of these 
there were large numbers of gram negative 
bacilli. The infarcts were rimmed by abun￾dant neutrophile polymorphonuclear leuko￾cytes, many eosinophiles and some lym￾phoid cells. Multiple infarcts were also 
present in the hepatic homografts removed 
from Patients 2-5 at autopsy. The areas of 
dead tissue were predominantly in the right 
lobe and were surrounded by a zone of 
proliferating fibroblasts and by small lym￾phocytes (Fig. 13). Several of the infarcts 
contained gram negative bacteria. In Pa￾tients 2, 3, and 4 thrombosis of the right

hepatic artery could be seen with the 
naked eye; in Patient 5 microscopy showed 
obliteration of this part of the arterial tree 
by organized thrombus. 
The pathological changes in the non￾infarcted parts of the liver varied in degree 
in the five cases. The liver biopsy obtained 
from Patient 1, 100 days after hepatic trans￾plantation, was the least abnormal (Fig. 
14). In the portal tracts there was a moder￾ately dense focal cellular infiltration. The 
majority of these cells were small lympho￾cytes, but about 5% were plasma cells with 
IgM in their cytoplasm. Several were neu￾trophile polymorphs; a few were eosino￾philes. There was a slight increase in the 
amount of portal reticulin and collagen and 
ne\v bile ductules were present in the 
portal tracts. The Kupffer cells were promi￾nent but not increased in number. A few 
of the centrilobular bile canaliculi con￾tained small bile "thrombi." There were no 
alterations in the fine structure of the he￾patocytes and the blood vessels were nor￾mal. The lack of important pathological 
changes in this liver correlated well with 
the good match of donor and recipient 
shown by lymphocyte typing. 
Similar, but slightly more pronounced 
changes, were present in the liver homo￾graFts removed from Patients 4 and 5 at 
2 and 3% months, respectively, after trans￾plantation (Fig. 15). Although the portal 
fibrosis was marked there was no linking 
of adjacent tracts. There were many pro￾liferating small bile ductules and in Patient 
5 the bile ducts were dilated and filled 
with casts that were composed of inspis￾sated bile, surrounded by neutrophile poly-

The most severely damaged homografts 
were those from the long surviving Patients 
2 and 3. In Patient 2 the portal fibrosis had 
progressed to cirrhosis. There was linking 
of portal tract to portal tract and portal 
tract to central vein by bands of fibrous 
tissue. The nolmal lobular architecture of 
the liver had been lost and there were 
small regeneration nodules. Areas of liver 
cell necrosis were present (Fig. 16). Some 
hepatic artery branches showed slight to 
moderate degrees of fibrous intimal thick￾ening. In Patient 3 there was portal fibro￾sis but not cirshosis. Many of the small 
branches of the hepatic artery were greatly 
narrowed or obliterated by intimal thicken￾ing. The thickened intima contained colla￾gen and large fat-laden cells. In some of 
the affected vessels the internal elastic 
lamina was ruptured. Cellular infiltration 
was slight, there being only a few foci of 
small lymphocytes in the portal tracts. This 
was in contrast to the dense lymphoid cell 
infiltration seen in the hepatic tissue re￾moved from this same patient 27 days after 
transplantation. 
Discussion 
Survival in all 7 of the presently reported 
cases exceeded that obtained previously in 
human 16vL97 22, 23 The results have 
established that the actual operative proce￾dure can be done in man with relative 
safety and that subsequent survival is pos￾sible for at least as long as 9 months. The 
course after transplantation of these chil￾dren was markedly different than that of 
earlier recipients of orthotopic liver homo- 

409 STARZL AND OTHERS Annals of Surgery September 1968 
grafts inasmuch as all but one of the pa￾tients had a very satisfactory early post￾operative convalescence. As discussed else￾where,20 the difference was probably due 
principally to several improvements in care 
including more discriminating donor selec￾tion, the employment of an efficient method 
of interim organ preservation, and im￾proved immunosuppressive agents. 
Three of the seven patients are still alive 
9 months, 2% months, and one month after 
transplantation. The other 4 died after 2, 
334, 434, and 6 months. In each case of the 
unsuccessfully treated recipients, the devel￾opment of a septic liver infarction either 
caused or significantly contributed to the 
unfavorable outcome. Even the child who 
is alive after 9 months developed the same 
life threatening complication. As reported 
earlier," the sequence of events seemed to 
be, first, infarction of portions of the homo￾grafts and, then, overgrowth of gram nega￾tive bacteria in the necrotic areas. Fortu￾nately, progress has been made in under￾standing the etiology of these disasters. 
Clearly an important factor is the natural 
susceptibility of the liver to bacterial con￾tamination via the portal vein or biliary 
tract. In a recent study in dogs and pigs 
which were not given antibiotic therapy \-- 
it was shown that the incidence of positive 
cultures from liver tissue was increased 
after simple sham operations in which the 
liver was not disturbed. When an ischemic 
injury was added by performance of sirnu￾lated autotransplantation, all livers became 
contaminated. The bacteriologic changes 
were even more pronounced in liver homo￾grafts transplanted either to unmodified or 
immunosuppressed recipients. It was con￾cluded that the numbers of bacteria in the 
liver reflected more or less accurately the 
magnitude of hepatic injury from mechani￾cal causes as well as from rejection. These 
studies help explain the previously reported 
variable incidence of liver abscess forma￾tion after autotransplantation l or homo￾transplantation of the canine liver "* 25; pre￾FIG. 17. An anatomical explanation of the pre￾disposition of the liver to bacterial sepsis. Presum￾ably the invading microorganisms enter via the 
portal vein or through the reconstructed biliary 
tract. 
sumably, any necrotic focus could become 
infected and serve as the beginning of an 
abscess cavity ( Fig. 17 ) particularly if the 
host were being given im~nunosuppressive 
therapy. They do not, however, fully ex￾plain the syndrome encountered in five of 
the seven human recipients. 
The patients did not have discrete ab￾scesses. Instead, the precipitating event 
seemed to be dearterialization of part or all 
of the right hepatic lobe. Studies of the de￾brided necrotic tissue 'O suggested acute is￾chemic infarctions in the right lobe which 

Volume 168 ORTHOTOPIC HOMOTRANSPLANTATION OF THE HUMAN LIVER 
Number 3 410 
in some areas had not yet become invaded 
by microorganisms. Furthermore, thrombo￾sis of the right hepatic artery was proved 
either at operation or autopsy in all four of 
the patients who died. In another child 
recently treated by Fonkal~rud,~ the same 
kind of selective thrombosis of the right 
hepatic artery was the cause of death 2 
weeks after liver replacement for extra￾hepatic biliary atresia. 
In an earlier report,20 we speculated that 
the ischemic infarcts might be a relatively 
isolated manifestation of uncontrolled acute 
homograft rejection. It was suggested that 
the hepatic blood flow, which has been 
shown to decline sharply in dogs at this 
time,1° might have dropped in some regions 
below a life sustaining level. A similar hy￾pothesis, based on angiographic studies in 
dogs, had previously been advanced by 
Moore et a2.l"~ a primary explanation, 
this proposition has since lost much of its 
persuasiveness in view of the aforemen￾tioned observations from the four autopsy 
examinations. 
In thesp four homografts, including the 
two which were examined 2 and 8 days 
after thrombosis of the right lobar arterial 
supply, there was little or no evidence of 
active rejection in the uninfarcted portions 
of the liver. The concept that immunologi￾cally mediated reductions in blood flow 
should specifically effect the right portion 
of the organ is further weakened by the 
fact that this kind of selective regional vul￾nerability of the liver has never been re￾ported in animal studies and probably does 
not occur, at least in dogs and pigs. In the 
canine and porcine bacteriologic experi￾ments cited above and in a separate inves￾tigation of liver scanning in dogs,s lobar 
and segmental necrosis were specifically 
looked for. There was not a single example 
in 32 experiments. 
There is now evidence from studies in 
fresh cadavers that mechanical factors pre￾dispose man (or at least small children) 
to a right lobar vascular accident, possibly 
because of the erect position used by hu￾mans. In humans the right hepatic artery is 
longer than the left branch (Fig. 18A) and 
usually traverses behind the other central 
hilar structures where it is held by sur￾rounding tissues. When the restraining liga￾ments of the liver are cut and when the 
vascular structures entering and leaving the 
liver are skeletonized, the right lobe ro￾tates on the fulcrum of the vertebral col￾umn and recedes to a somewhat more pos￾terior and inferior location than normal. If 
the head of the x-ray table is elevated to 
60°, a sharp kink of the proximal right he￾patic artery can be demonstrated (Fig. 
18B). Presumably such a dangerous situ￾ation could be further aggravated in the 
post-transplantation period either by the 
diminutions in blood flow or by the organ 
swelling which occurs with rejection. The 
constellation of circumstances might be 
especially hazardous in infant livers with 
their fine caliber thin-walled arterial 
branches. 
Because of the possible contributory role 
of such mechanical factors in the produc￾tion of right lobar infarction, the homograft 
was fixed in the desired position in the last 
two cases by firmly reattaching its falci￾form ligament to the same ligament in the 
recipient. Thus far, these two patients have 
not had any evidence of acute liver necrosis 
during the follow up studies of one and 
254 months, respectively. 
Compared to the septic liver infarctions, 
the other complications seen in these pa￾tients seemed relatively trivial. The mild 
intraoperative bleeding diathesis required 
no therapy. The acute acidosis which oc￾curred at about the same time 20 was easily 
managed. The right hemidiaphragmatic pa￾ralysis which was probably caused by 
crushing the right phrenic nerve in Patients 
1-3, was transient ( 10 to 50 days); further￾more it was prevented in the next four 
cases.

plagued earlier attempts at orthotopic liver

patients. Pulmonary embolization, which

the lower venotomy sites used for insertion

in the presently reported series that such 
external bypasses are not necessary. 
Most importantly, the toxicity from im￾munosuppressi\~e agents so often seen in 
our earlier experience l9, "v 23 was avoided. 
There were no examples of bone marrow

rejection during their one and 254 month 
periods of follow-up study. Evaluation of 
the effectiveness of the foregoing immuno￾suppressive regimen was complicated in 
the other five cases by the development of 
extensive liver necrosis which, as discussed 
earlier, was not necessarily caused by rejec￾tion but which could be expected to ad￾versely effect both hepatic function and 
structure. In one of the latter three patients 
\vho survived this complication at 23 days 
(Case I), a liver biopsy 77 days later had 
only minimal abnormalities. The donor￾recipient histocompatibility match in this 
case was the best one in the entire series; 
good liver function has been maintained 
during the entire 9 months after transplan￾tation. The other two children who were 
saved by liver debridement or excision, 
only to die of hepatic failure 4 and 5% 
months later, had shrunken homografts at 
autopsy. Histologically, these organs had 
the kind of fibrosis seen in many long sur￾vivors after comparable canine liver trans￾plantation." However, there were no 
mononuclear cells or other stigmata of ac￾tive rejection in the specimens. 
Similarly, the principal abnormalities in 
the homografts from the two children who 
died after 2 and 3!/, months, within a few 
days after right hepatic artery thrombosis, 
\trere those of repair and to a lesser degree, 
regeneration. In each, the extent of fibrosis 
was moderate. Both of these patients had 
passed through difficult early rejections but 
had good liver functioil prior to the vascu￾lar accidents in the transplants; serum bili￾rubins were 2 and 2.3 mg./100 ml., respec￾tively, just before death. 
Reasonable conclusions from these com￾bined clinical and pathologic observations 
would seem to be that the immunosuppres￾sive regimen used did not uniformly pre￾vent the onset of rejection; that it permitted 
eventual control of the acute phase of this 
process; and that the degree of ultimate 
organ damage was a reflection of the se￾verity of earlier rejection injury and in turn 
of the extent of donor-recipient histocom￾patibility. Efforts to improve the histocom￾patibility matches in future trials will de￾pend upon characterization of the white 
cell antigen profile of a large number of 
prospective recipients from whom the ap￾propriate choice could be made. In order 
to have a large enough recipient pool to 
permit fine selectivity, an inter-city net￾work of collaborating physicians will be 
necessary such as that which is now being 
developed through our institutions. 
Summary 
Seven patients aged 13 months to 16 
years were treated with orthotopic homo￾transplantation of cadaveric livers between 
July, 1967 and March, 1968. The indication 
for operation was congenital extrahepatic 
biliary atresia in five cases and carcinoma 
of the liver in the other two. The histocom￾patibility match between the donors and 
recipients ranged from poor to excellent. 
After donor death, the homografts received 
interim preservation with a technic that in￾cluded hypothermia, hyperbaric oxygena￾tion and perfusion with diluted blood. Post￾operative immunosuppressive therapy was 
provided with azathioprine, prednisone, 
and heterologous antilymphocyte globulin 
(ALG). Four of the recipients died after 
60, 105, 133, and 186 days. The other three 
are still alive after 9, 2!4, and one months. 
The improved results in the present series 
compared with those obtained in earlier 
human trials, seem to be a consequence of 
improved donor selection, the application 
of an effective organ preservation system 
and the use of an improved immunosup￾pressive regimen. 
All seven of the recipients had good early 
liver function. In five of the seven cases all 
or part of the right liver lobe underwent 
necrosis from 2 to 104 days after operation. 
Thrombosis of the right hepatic artery was 
proved in four of these homografts either 
at operation or autopsy; additional angio￾graphic studies in cadavers suggested that

September 1968 
the regional de-arterialization had an at 
least partially mechanical etiology. With in￾vasion of the necrotic liver tissue by gram 
negative bacteria, the patients became pro￾foundly toxic. Two of the recipients died 
within a few days, and two others died of 
progressive liver failure 4 and 554 months 
later. 
In the 5 livers studied pathologically 
from 60 days to more than Bmonths after 
transplantation, there was portal fibrosis, a 
slight infiltration by small lymphocytes 
around the portal vein branches, prolifera￾tion of small bile ductules and some cen￾tral cholt~stasis. Oilc of the two longer - sur￾viving homografts had progressed to cirrho￾sis and in both many of the small hepatic 
artery branches were narrowed by inti￾ma1 thickening. These various changes are 
thought to be the result of rejections; they 
were least severe in the homograft - which 
was shown by lymphocyte typing to he 
most compatible with its recipient. 
Addendum 
July 13, 1968-The 3 patients surviving at the 
time the nlanuscript was submitted are still alive. 
The first patient will be one year post-transplanta￾tion in 10 days. The other 2 havc now been fol￾lowed for 5 ant1 4 postoperative months respec￾tively. Three other recipients treated 3 months, 
6 weeks, and 3?h_ weeks ago are well. Tliere have 
been no septic hepatic infarctions in the last 5 
cases.

DR. FRANCIS D. MOORE (Boston) : Dr. Starzl's 
work in this field is absolutely outstanding and for 
those of us interested in liver transplantation, 
this is a banner d'ay when we can contemplate four 
patients alive and well with lethal liver disease 
removed and a new liver in place. This is a mag￾nificent achievement and liver surgery as of this 
day has an entirely new look from hither forward. 
But I would like to use this opportunity to dis￾cuss another aspect of Dr. Starzl's work. 
Four years ago, at the Society of University 
Surgeons, when Dr. Starzl's initial clinical ex￾perience and ours likewise had ended with 
fatality, it was clear (and so stated at the meet￾ing) that more progress was needed before it 
would be ethically, morally, surgically and 
scientifically acceptable to move ahead again with 
clinical liver transplantation. 
Immunosuppression without hepatotoxicity was 
essential, as well as improved perfusion-storage. 
Now these things have come to pass, especially 
by the development of anti-lymphocyte globulin, 
and it is appropriate again to move ahead. If this 
forward motion is undertaken by persons or de￾partments that have practical capability in trans￾plant immunology and histocompatibility match￾ing, as well as surgical experience with transplants￾tion and the postoperative care of patients on im￾munosuppression, there is no need for consultant 
boards to declare the patient operable or 2 team 
from another institution to decide that the donor is 
dead. 
The time-temperature curves for liver donation, 
the permissible normothermic dead-time, and the 
prior state of death are the same for liver dona￾tion as for heart, with the heart somewhat less 
vulnerable to nonnothermic ischemia. 
There has recently been a statement issued 
by a committee in Washington that attempts to 
deal with these matters as applied to the heart. 
As nearly as I can see, none of the authors of 
this document has busied himself with the trans￾plant problem over these last 15 yeara; the docu￾ment makes no reference whatsoever to the long 
work of many Departments in this country who 
have labored through the difficult years of trans￾plantation, nor does it acknowledge the obvious 
fact that actual experience in immunogenetics, 
immunosuppression and surgical transplantation 
are the essential normal ~rcrequisites to moving 
ahead with any newly transplantable organ. 
Nor does it make reference to the fact that 
the moral security of the next 25 years of American 
surgery, in exploring this new field, will rest 
secure just where it has in the past 20 years: 
in giving frce and untrammelled opportunity for 
development to those Departments and individuals 
that are willing to take the time and trouble to 
develop both the immunological and surgical 
aspects of organ transplantation, as Dr. Stanl has 
demonstrated today with a project that was held 
in abeyance until the fundamentally ethical nature 
of science itself indicated that it was time again 
to move ahead. 
DR. ERIC W. FONKALSRUD (LOS Angeles): 
I would like to congratulate Dr. Starzl and his 
associates for their very excellent contributicns 
to furthering the knowledge of both liver presenra￾tion and transplantation, and for their remarkably 
good clinical results, shown in this study. 
We have followed Dr. Starzl's work with 
very great interest, however have used a slightly 
different technic in the laboratory and in one 
patient.

The emphasis in our studies has been on the in the area that was not infarcted. The area of use of hepatic cell stabilizing drugs, such as transition between the infarct and the normal 
chlorpromazine and cortisone administered to the liver tissue is clearly seen. I would like to ask

As to the cause for the late thrombosis, I 
think one can only speculate. It seems likely to us 
that the mechanical defect which I demonstrated 
earlier may not be completely occlusive and that 
there may be added factors, as Dr. Fonkalsrud 
suggested. Possibilities might include the swelling 
that occurs in liver homografts at the time of 
active rejection, or alternatively the diminished 
blood flow that is very often seen in the canine 
liver at the time of a potentially reversible re￾jection. With a combination of any of these cir￾cumstances, infant livers with their fragile arteries 
might be subject to a special risk of dearterializa￾tion.
