Lung Disease in Japanese Patients with Rheumatoid
Arthritis Receiving Biologic Therapy

ABSTRACT. Objective. To review patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) receiving biologic therapy following a
diagnosis of nontuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) lung disease and to evaluate disease deterioration
according to clinical and radiological features and anti-NTM therapy.
Methods. We retrospectively analyzed medical records of 11 human immunodeficiency
virus-negative patients with RA (median age, 64 years) receiving biologic therapy following
diagnosis of NTM lung disease.
Results. NTM species included Mycobacterium avium complex in 9 patients (81.8%) and M.
gordonae in 2 (18.2%). Underlying respiratory disease was present in 6 patients (54.5%), and most
(81.8%) had radiographic features of nodular/bronchiectatic disease. Extent of NTM disease was
1–2 pulmonary lobes in 6 patients (54.5%), 3–4 lobes in 5 patients (45.5%), and 5–6 lobes in none.
The results of radiological evaluations were unchanged or improved in 7 patients (63.6%) and
worsened in 4 (36.4%). Radiological outcome was worse in patients with poor RA control despite
their receiving biologic therapies for RA. Two of 3 patients receiving anti-NTM therapy as initial
management for NTM improved, and 1 worsened. Three of 4 patients with worsened radiological
outcome had high erythrocyte sedimentation rate (> 50 mm/h).
Conclusion. Radiological deterioration was not observed in the majority of patients with RA
receiving biologic therapy with NTM lung disease, and radiological outcome of pulmonary NTM
was favorable in some patients undergoing anti-NTM therapy. Further studies focusing on disease
deterioration according to biologic therapy received during NTM followup are warranted to
determine appropriate treatment of RA patients with NTM lung disease. (First Release Nov 1 2013;

A high frequency of infections complicating patients with
rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has been reported in comparison
with patients without RA1. This was presumed to be the
result of the immunomodulatory effects of RA or agents
with immunosuppressive effects used in its treatment1.
Tuberculosis and nontuberculous mycobacterial (NTM)
infections in association with concurrent administration of
biologic therapies have been reported2,3. Further, in regions
with low prevalence of tuberculosis, NTM infections may
be an important complication of anti-tumor necrosis factor
(anti-TNF) therapy as the biologic agent2. Contrary to that
of tuberculosis, NTM incidence is increasing within the
United States and Europe, particularly among older
women4. Winthrop, et al2 reported that the incidence rate of
NTM among patients with RA undergoing anti-TNF therapy
was more than 5-fold higher vs RA patients not exposed to
anti-TNF therapy. Further, 39% of patients in the group
administered anti-TNF therapy after NTM diagnosis died2.
Unlike the process in tuberculosis infection, there is no
evidence of a latent phase in NTM infection. Therefore,
screening and preventive treatments against NTM infection
in patients scheduled to begin anti-TNF therapy might not
be feasible5. Thus, the timely diagnosis of pulmonary NTM
disease is critical during biologic therapy for RA.
We previously classified antirheumatic drugs during
NTM lung disease followup along with the risk of combi￾nation therapy, e.g., TNF antagonists/tocilizumab, metho￾trexate (MTX), and corticosteroid, but their contribution to
radiological deterioration was not assessed6. The most

important point is the relation between NTM lung disease
and these biologic agents. Because it is difficult to conduct
a prospective study of biologic therapy for RA patients with
NTM lung disease, there is a paucity of available reports, so
our study should be valuable. Our aims were to retrospec￾tively review patients with RA receiving biologic therapies
following diagnosis of NTM lung disease and to evaluate
disease deterioration according to clinical and radiological
features and anti-NTM therapy received. This investigation
was clinically relevant and important to determine appro￾priate treatment of RA patients with NTM lung disease.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients. We studied 11 patients with RA over 18 years of age who received
biologic therapies following diagnosis of NTM lung disease, fulfilled 2007
American Thoracic Society/Infectious Disease Society of America
(ATS/IDSA) NTM diagnostic criteria7, and were newly diagnosed from
1993 through July 2012. NTM lung disease diagnosis and therapy were
conducted at the Saitama Cardiovascular and Respiratory Center, Saitama,
Japan. All patients fulfilled revised criteria for RA of the American
Rheumatism Association8. RA diagnosis and therapy were conducted by
rheumatologists at other institutions.
Study design. This was a retrospective study for which clinical data were
collected from medical records. Baseline clinical characteristics were
obtained within 1 month of initial NTM diagnosis. Radiographic abnor￾malities of NTM lung disease were classified according to the following 4
disease patterns seen on chest high-resolution computed tomography
(HRCT): nodular/bronchiectatic (NB), fibrocavitary (FC), FC+NB, and
unclassifiable9. No patient had an unclassifiable pattern. Underlying res￾piratory diseases were classified as usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP),
emphysema, previous pulmonary tuberculosis, and bronchiolitis. No
patients had ≥ 2 underlying respiratory diseases. Because bronchiectasis
and NTM often coexist, making causality difficult to determine10,
bronchiectasis was not counted as an underlying respiratory disease9. If
drug administration for NTM lung disease was initiated within 6 months
after diagnosis and continued for > 3 months, we considered this as initial
management9. If no treatment was initiated within 6 months after diagnosis,
we considered initial management to be observation. Patients were
followed through March 2013.
Evaluation of chest HRCT findings. If the antirheumatic drug was not
changed during the observational periods and HRCT was performed each
year, assessment of radiologic change was independently performed by 2
radiologists and classified as improvement, no change, or deterioration. To
quantify observer variation, κ coefficients of agreement were calculated for
assessment of radiologic changes. The important problem was how to
differentiate NTM lung disease from normal colonization with regard to
sputum culture results in the patients with RA. We first searched the
database of NTM cultures of our hospital and selected patients with RA.
Then, we removed the patients with normal chest CT findings. If patients
had only bronchiectasis without centrilobular nodules of different sizes or
cavities, we considered this to be colonization. Time to radiologic deterio￾ration was evaluated for the period from the date of the first HRCT to the
date when deterioration was first observed.
Data analysis. Categorical baseline characteristics are summarized by
frequency and percentage, and characteristics are reported as median
(range). We compared baseline characteristics for each NTM species, each
radiographic feature, each underlying respiratory disease, each
antirheumatic drug for radiological evaluation, anti-NTM therapy, and
antirheumatic drugs during the NTM followup period. We collected
demographic characteristics, body mass index (BMI; we used the current
World Health Organization BMI cutoff value for underweight of < 18.5
kg/m2), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP),
anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibody, rheumatoid factor
(RF), IgG, NTM species, radiographic features, underlying respiratory
disease, and RA data including disease duration, disease activity, and
antirheumatic drugs used at NTM diagnosis and post-NTM diagnosis. We
also evaluated radiological outcome for antirheumatic drugs and anti-NTM
therapy. Our study was approved by the institutional review board of the
Saitama Cardiovascular and Respiratory Center (2012047).
RESULTS
Characteristics of patients with RA receiving biologic
therapies after diagnosis of pulmonary NTM. Of the 11
patients, 8 (72.7%) were women, and 4 (36.4%) had a
history of smoking. No patients were infected with human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV). NTM species included
Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) in 9 patients
(81.8%) and M. gordonae in 2 (18.2%). Median patient age
was 64 years (range: 44–82 yrs). Median BMI was 20.2
kg/m2 (range: 14.1–29.0 kg/m2). Underlying respiratory
disease was present in 6 patients (54.5%): 3 patients had
bronchiolitis, 1 had emphysema, 1 had UIP, and 1 had
previous pulmonary tuberculosis. Radiographic features on
HRCT included NB disease in 9 patients (81.8%), FC
disease in 1 (9.1%), and FC+NB disease in 1 (9.1%). Extent
of NTM disease was 1–2 pulmonary lobes in 6 patients
(54.5%), 3–4 lobes in 5 patients (45.5%), and 5–6 lobes in
none. Median serum level of lymphocytes was 1300/µl
(range: 500–3300/µl), albumin was 3.8 g/dl (range: 3.2–4.1
g/dl), ESR was 28 mm/h (range 5–93 mm/h), CRP was 0.74
mg/dl (range: 0.02–3.21 mg/dl), and IgG was 1725 mg/dl
(range: 1115–2967 mg/dl). Ten patients (90.9%) were
positive for serum RF, 7 (63.6%) were positive for anti-CCP
antibody, and status was unknown in 3 patients. No patient
had other concomitant collagen diseases such as Sjögren
syndrome, systemic sclerosis, or dermatomyositis/poly￾myositis.
Microbiological examination of patients diagnosed as
having pulmonary NTM. Culture results from at least 2
separate expectorated sputum samples were positive in 8
patients, and culture results from at least 1 bronchial wash
or lavage were positive in 3 patients (Cases 3, 6, and 7).
Only 1 patient (Case 8) had a specimen that was positive for
acid-fast bacilli smears at NTM diagnosis; acid-fast bacilli
were cultured later in the other patients.
Biologic therapies administered during pulmonary NTM
followup. Median duration of RA was 15 years (range 2
months–24 years). Biologic agents were administered as an
antirheumatic therapy for RA at NTM diagnosis in 4
patients (36.4%). Biologic therapies administered during
pulmonary NTM followup included etanercept (ETN) in 8
patients (72.7%), tocilizumab (TCZ) in 2 patients (18.2%),
and infliximab (IFX) in 1 patient (9.1%). In the 3 patients
receiving anti-NTM therapy as the initial management for
NTM, 2 patients improved [Cases 6, 7 (Case 7; Figure 1)]
and 1 patient worsened (Case 11; Table 1). There was a
tendency for ESR to be high (> 50 mm/h) in 3 of the 4

Of the 11 patients receiving biologic therapies, 4 began

sputum specimens for acid-fast bacilli smears, but nontuber￾culous mycobacteria were cultured after starting biologic
therapy (Cases 1–3, 9), and 2 patients with these same
results in microbiological studies were continued on
biologic therapy already in progress (Cases 5, 10). Biologic
therapy was continued in these 6 patients, including the 2

patients with insufficient RA control (Cases 9, 10). The
other 5 patients were diagnosed as having NTM lung
disease at the start of biologic therapy, which was adminis￾tered after we received informed consent from these patients
because control of their RA was poor (Cases 4, 6–8, and 11).
Radiological outcome was unchanged or improved in 7
patients (63.6%) and worsened in 4 patients (36.4%). The
patients with poor control of RA tended to have worsened
radiological outcome despite receiving biologic therapies
for RA (Cases 9–11). Interobserver agreement on radiologic
changes was good (κ = 0.816, 95% CI 0.578–1.055).
Treatments and outcomes of patients with worsened
pulmonary NTM disease during biologic therapy for RA.
With the exception of 1 patient (Case 10), 3 of 4 patients
stopped biologic therapy when pulmonary NTM disease
worsened (Table 3). In Case 9, ETN was stopped for 5
months, antirheumatic drug was changed to MTX without
anti-NTM therapy, and no radiological deterioration
occurred for 16 months. One patient received anti-NTM
therapy and stopped ETN, which resulted in improved
radiological outcome for 1 month (Case 8). The remaining
patient received TCZ with anti-NTM therapy (clarithro￾mycin, ethambutol, and rifampicin) as initial management,
but worsened. Therefore, TCZ was then discontinued, and
anti-NTM therapy was reinforced with streptomycin.
However, radiological outcome worsened, and this patient
was complicated by chronic pulmonary aspergillosis (Case
11; Figure 2). He died 10 months later with a final diagnosis
of chronic pulmonary aspergillosis. In Case 10, biologic
therapy was changed from IFX to ETN without anti-NTM
therapy, and no radiological deterioration occurred for 19
months while receiving ETN. Afterward, control of RA was
poor, ETN was changed to TCZ, and the patient’s condition
worsened for 5 months (Figure 3).
DISCUSSION
We investigated patients with RA receiving biologic therapy
following a diagnosis of NTM lung disease, and evaluated
disease deterioration according to clinical and radiological
features and anti-NTM therapy. In the 11 patients studied,
NTM species included MAC in 9 patients (81.8%) and M.
gordonae in 2 (18.2%). The results of radiological evalua￾tions were unchanged or improved in 7 patients (63.6%) and
worsened in 4 patients (36.4%). The patients with poor
control of RA despite receiving biologic therapies for RA
tended to have worsening of radiological outcome. Of the 3
patients receiving anti-NTM therapy as initial management
for NTM, 2 patients improved, but 1 patient worsened. Of
the 4 patients with worsening of radiological outcome, ESR
was high in 3 patients.
RA is known to be associated with an increased risk of
infectious diseases. In the later decades of the last century,
controlled observational studies found that age-adjusted
mortality in patients with RA increased by about 2-fold
compared with the general population, and infectious
diseases were 1 of the 3 leading causes of premature death
in RA cohorts in the United States and Europe11,12,13,14.
Listing, et al reported that chronic comorbidity, smoking,
active RA, high-dose corticosteroid, and TNF inhibitor are
associated with an increased risk of infection15, and the
most common events are respiratory infections15,16.
Takayanagi, et al reviewed 149 Japanese cases of
pulmonary infections in patients with RA and found that
NTM disease was the most frequent pulmonary infection,
accounting for 40% of cases17.
We previously reported that 98 HIV-negative patients
with RA who had NTM lung disease had overall cumulative
5- and 10-year mortality rates of 33.9% and 52.6%, respec￾tively. MAC was the most frequent pathogen (83.7%),
followed by M. kansasii (6.1%), M. gordonae (6.1%), and
others (4.1%). Antirheumatic drugs received at NTM
diagnosis included MTX in 31.6% of patients, of whom
12.2% concomitantly received corticosteroid, corticosteroid
without MTX in 27.6% of patients, and biologic agents only
in 6.1% of patients6.
The risk of serious infections in RA corresponds to an
OR of about 1.2–1.4 in TNF antagonist-treated patients18,19.
Similar OR were found for abatacept (1.4) and TCZ
(1.3)20,21. The ATS/IDSA guidelines for NTM diseases state
that patients with active NTM disease should receive TNF-α
blocking agents only if they are also receiving adequate
therapy for the NTM disease7. In addition, the Japanese

guidelines for use of infliximab and etanercept in RA
recommend that TNF antagonists be avoided in patients
with a history of NTM infection22. Some cases of fatal NTM
lung disease occurring during biologic therapy for RA were
reported, which included NTM species of M. abscessus in 2
cases and M. xenopi and M. peregrinum in 1 case
each23,24,25,26. Therefore, most rheumatologists avoid the
use of biologic therapies in RA patients with NTM with a
poor prognosis such as cavity type or with wide extent of
pulmonary disease, the presence of concomitant serious
pulmonary disease, or rapid worsening of disease. Thus, is
biologic therapy absolutely contraindicated in RA patients
with NTM lung disease? 
In our present study of biologic therapies administered
during pulmonary NTM followup, 5 patients (45.5%)
experienced no radiological deterioration despite receiving
no anti-NTM therapy. Moreover, radiologic findings
improved in 3 patients, 2 of whom received anti-NTM
therapy as initial management (Cases 6, 7). In fact, Mori, et
al reported favorable therapeutic outcomes of NTM lung
diseases in patients with a history of NTM infection; NTM
species included MAC (92.3%) and M. abscessus (7.7%)27.
However, 1 of our patients worsened severely despite
stopping biologic therapy and receiving anti-NTM therapy
(Case 11). The 11 patients in the present study tended to
have a mild form of NTM lung disease such as that with
NB-type radiologic features (81.8%) and negative acid-fast
bacilli smears from respiratory specimens (90.9%). Further
studies are needed to assess the safety of biologic agents
used in moderate to severe forms of NTM lung disease.
We also previously reported that ESR > 50 mm/h was a
negative prognostic factor for radiological deterioration of
NTM lung disease in patients with RA6. In our present
study, the ESR was > 50 mm/h in 3 of the 4 patients with
worsened radiological outcome (Cases 9-11). Control of RA
in these patients was poor despite biologic therapies.
Therefore, the cause of the high ESR was considered to be
due not only to NTM activity but also to RA activity. High
RA disease activity leads to an increased risk of serious
infection in RA patients28. From this point of view, in
reality, some RA patients with NTM lung disease in whom
RA activity is difficult to control will require biologic
therapy clinically. In regard to biologic agents, the use of
IFX or adalimumab rather than ETN is a strong and signifi￾cant predictor of infection29,30. In our present study, for the
observational period that was not limited only to the period
Figure 2. Chest computed tomography of Case 11 at diagnosis of pulmonary nontuberculous mycobacteriosis
(NTM) showed a small cavity and infiltrations in the left lingular segment lobe and opacity in the right middle
lobe (A). After 6 months of tocilizumab (TCZ) and anti-NTM therapy, the cavity shadows had extended (B).
After 4 months of reinforced anti-NTM therapy and discontinuation of TCZ, the radiological outcome worsened
and was complicated by chronic pulmonary aspergillosis (C).
Figure 3. Chest computed tomography of Case 10 at diagnosis of pulmonary nontuberculous mycobacteriosis (NTM) showed centrilobular small nodules in
the right middle lobe (A). After 2 months of infliximab (IFX), the small nodule shadows had extended slightly (B). After 19 months of etanercept therapy
following discontinuation of IFX, there was no radiological deterioration (C). After 5 months of tocilizumab therapy following discontinuation of the
etanercept, the small nodule shadows had worsened slightly (D).

that the biologic therapy was administered, 2 (22.2%) of 9
patients receiving ETN worsened. However, 1 patient
receiving IFX worsened (Case 10), as did 2 of 3 patients
receiving tocilizumab (Cases 4, 11). In Case 10, there was
no radiological deterioration for 19 months with ETN,
whereas deterioration occurred for 2 months with IFX and
for 5 months with TCZ. Therefore, the relation between
each biologic agent and pulmonary NTM deterioration must
be elucidated.
No radiological deterioration occurred in some RA
patients with NTM lung disease receiving biologic therapy.
Although the radiological outcome of pulmonary NTM
treated with anti-NTM therapy was favorable in some
patients, it worsened in others despite administration of
anti-NTM therapy. It is important to stress both that potent
drugs available to control NTM infection are scarce and that
suppression of host immunity with biologic therapy for RA
may be catastrophic for the patient. Therefore, further
studies focusing on disease deterioration according to
biologic therapy received during NTM followup are
warranted and will be necessary for determining appropriate
treatment of RA patients with NTM lung disease.
