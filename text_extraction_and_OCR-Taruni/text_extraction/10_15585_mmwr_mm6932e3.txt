On August 7, 2020, this report was posted as an MMWR Early 
Release on the MMWR website (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr).
Most reported cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) 
in children aged <18 years appear to be asymptomatic or mild 
(1). Less is known about severe COVID-19 illness requir￾ing hospitalization in children. During March 1–July 25, 
2020, 576 pediatric COVID-19 cases were reported to the 
COVID-19–Associated Hospitalization Surveillance Network 
(COVID-NET), a population-based surveillance system that 
collects data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19–associated 
hospitalizations in 14 states (2,3). Based on these data, the 
cumulative COVID-19-associated hospitalization rate among 
children aged <18 years during March 1–July 25, 2020, was 
8.0 per 100,000 population, with the highest rate among 
children aged <2 years (24.8). During March 21–July 25, 
weekly hospitalization rates steadily increased among chil￾dren (from 0.1 to 0.4 per 100,000, with a weekly high of 
0.7 per 100,000). Overall, Hispanic or Latino (Hispanic) and 
non-Hispanic black (black) children had higher cumulative 
rates of COVID-19–associated hospitalizations (16.4 and 
10.5 per 100,000, respectively) than did non-Hispanic white 
(white) children (2.1). Among 208 (36.1%) hospitalized chil￾dren with complete medical chart reviews, 69 (33.2%) were 
admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU); 12 of 207 (5.8%) 
required invasive mechanical ventilation, and one patient 
died during hospitalization. Although the cumulative rate of 
pediatric COVID-19–associated hospitalization remains low 
(8.0 per 100,000 population) compared with that among 
adults (164.5),* weekly rates increased during the surveillance 
period, and one in three hospitalized children were admitted to 
the ICU, similar to the proportion among adults. Continued 
tracking of SARS-CoV-2 infections among children is impor￾tant to characterize morbidity and mortality. Reinforcement of 
prevention efforts is essential in congregate settings that serve 
children, including childcare centers and schools.

COVID-NET conducts population-based surveillance for 
laboratory-confirmed COVID-19–associated hospitaliza￾tions in 99 counties† in 14 states (California, Connecticut, 
Colorado, Georgia, Iowa, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, 
New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Oregon, Tennessee, and Utah), 
representing all 10 U.S. Department of Health and Human 
Services regions (2,3). Laboratory-confirmed COVID-19–
associated hospitalizations among residents in a predefined 
surveillance catchment area who had a positive SARS-CoV-2 
molecular test during hospitalization or up to 14 days before 
admission are included in surveillance. SARS-CoV-2 tests are 
ordered at the discretion of the treating health care provider. 
Trained surveillance officers perform medical chart abstractions 
for all identified cases. Patients aged <18 years hospitalized with 
COVID-19 during March 1–July 25, 2020, were included in 
this analysis. Weekly and cumulative COVID-19–associated 
hospitalization rates were calculated using the number of 
catchment area residents hospitalized with COVID-19 as the 
numerator and the National Center for Health Statistics vin￾tage 2019 bridged-race postcensal population estimates as the 
denominator.§ Descriptive analyses were conducted using all 
†Counties in COVID-NET surveillance: California (Alameda, Contra Costa, 
and San Francisco counties); Colorado (Adams, Arapahoe, Denver, Douglas, 
and Jefferson counties); Connecticut (New Haven and Middlesex counties); 
Georgia (Clayton, Cobb, DeKalb, Douglas, Fulton, Gwinnett, Newton, and 
Rockdale counties); Iowa (one county represented); Maryland (Allegany, Anne

Please Note: This report has been corrected. The definition of pediatric obesity was incorrectly stated in the text of the report and in the Table footnote; however, 
the analysis was correct and used the CDC definition of pediatric obesity for children aged ≥2 years (body mass index [kg/m2] ≥95th percentile for age and sex 
based on CDC growth charts).

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Most reported SARS-CoV-2 infections in children aged <18 years 
are asymptomatic or mild. Less is known about severe COVID-19 
in children requiring hospitalization.
What is added by this report?
Analysis of pediatric COVID-19 hospitalization data from 
14 states found that although the cumulative rate of 
COVID-19–associated hospitalization among children 
(8.0 per 100,000 population) is low compared with that in 
adults (164.5), one in three hospitalized children was admitted 
to an intensive care unit.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Children are at risk for severe COVID-19. Public health 
authorities and clinicians should continue to track pediatric 
SARS-CoV-2 infections. Reinforcement of prevention efforts is 
essential in congregate settings that serve children, including 
childcare centers and schools.
available data; however, for clinical interventions, treatments, 
and outcomes, only those hospitalizations with complete medi￾cal chart review and a discharge disposition (i.e., discharged 
alive or died during hospitalization) were included. Obesity 
was defined as body mass index (kg/m2) ≥95th percentile for 
age and sex based on CDC growth charts among children 
aged ≥2 years; this was not evaluated for children <2 years. All 
analyses were conducted using SAS statistical software (version 
9.4; SAS Institute). COVID-NET activities were determined 
by CDC to be public health surveillance.¶ Participating sites 
obtained approval for COVID-NET surveillance from their 
respective state and local Institutional Review Boards, as required.
During March 1–July 25, 576 children hospitalized with 
COVID-19 were reported to COVID-NET. Infants aged 
<3 months accounted for 18.8% of all children hospital￾ized with COVID-19 (Table). The median patient age was 
8 years (interquartile range [IQR] = 9 months–15 years), 
and 292 (50.7%) were males. Among 526 (91.3%) children 
for whom race and ethnicity information were reported, 241 
(45.8%) were Hispanic, 156 (29.7%) were black, 74 (14.1%) 
were white; 24 (4.6%) were non-Hispanic Asian or Pacific 
Islander; and four (0.8%) were non-Hispanic American Indian/
Alaska Native.
The cumulative COVID-19–associated hospitalization 
rate among children aged <18 years during the surveillance 
period was 8.0 per 100,000 and was highest among children 
aged <2 years (24.8); rates were substantially lower in children 
aged 2–4 years (4.2) and 5–17 years (6.4) (Figure 1). Overall 
weekly hospitalization rates among children increased steadily

Regulations 46, Protection of Human Subjects.
during the surveillance period (from 0.1 to 0.4 per 100,000, 
with a weekly high of 0.7 per 100,000; trend test, p<0.001) 
(Figure 1). COVID-19–associated hospitalization rates were 
higher among Hispanic and black children than among white 
children (Figure 2); the rates among Hispanic and black chil￾dren were nearly eight times and five times, respectively, the 
rate in white children.
Among 222 (38.5%) of 576 children with information on 
underlying medical conditions, 94 (42.3%) had one or more 
underlying conditions (Table). The most prevalent conditions 
included obesity (37.8%), chronic lung disease (18.0%), and 
prematurity (gestational age <37 weeks at birth, collected 
only for children aged <2 years) (15.4%). Hispanic and black 
children had higher prevalences of underlying conditions 
(45.7% and 29.8%, respectively) compared with white children 
(14.9%). Reported signs and symptoms upon hospital admis￾sion differed by age: fever or chills were the most common sign 
and symptom overall (54%) and were most prevalent among 
children aged <2 years (74.6%). Gastrointestinal symptoms, 
including nausea or vomiting, abdominal pain, or diarrhea, 
were reported by 42% of hospitalized children overall.
A medical chart review was completed for 208 (36.1%) 
children. Median duration of hospitalization was 2.5 days 
(IQR = 1–5 days). Among 67 children who had a chest radio￾graph during hospitalization, 44 (65.7%) radiographs showed 
an infiltrate or consolidation. Among 14 children with chest 
computed tomography results available, ground-glass opacities 
(a nonspecific sign indicating infection or alveolar disease) was 
reported in 10. COVID-19 investigational treatments were 
only administered to 12 (5.8%) children, all aged 5–17 years; 
nine received remdesivir. Intravenous immunoglobulin was 
received by 14 of 208 (6.7%) children. Sixty-nine children 
(33.2%) were admitted to the ICU for a median of 2 days 
(IQR = 1–5 days). Invasive mechanical ventilation was required 
by 12 (5.8%) of 207 children. Since June 18, a discharge 
diagnosis of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children 
(MIS-C) has been systematically collected**; overall, nine 
(10.8%) of 83 children with completed chart reviews for whom 
information about MIS-C was systematically collected received 
a diagnosis of MIS-C. Among 208 children with a discharge 
disposition, one child (0.5%) with multiple underlying condi￾tions died during hospitalization.
Discussion
Since March 1, 2020, COVID-NET has identified 576 
pediatric COVID-19–associated hospitalizations. Although 
the cumulative COVID-19–associated hospitalization rate 
among children is low compared with that among adults, 
** MIS-C is a hyperinflammatory condition that can affect multiple organs in 
a child who has a current or recent infection with SARS-CoV-2.

weekly hospitalization rates in children increased during the 
surveillance period. Children can develop severe COVID-19 
illness; during the surveillance period, one in three children 
were admitted to the ICU. Hispanic and black children had 
the highest rates of COVID-19–associated hospitalization.
Continued surveillance will allow for further characteriza￾tion of the burden and outcomes of COVID-19–associated 
hospitalizations among children. These data will help to bet￾ter define the clinical spectrum of disease in children and the 
contributions of race and ethnicity and underlying medical 
conditions to hospitalizations and outcomes. 
Reasons for disparities in COVID-19-associated hospital￾ization rates by race and ethnicity are not fully understood. 
This report found the highest rates of COVID-19-associated 
hospitalization among Hispanic children. Similarly, a recent 
study from the Baltimore-District of Columbia region found 
a higher prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the Hispanic 
community compared with that in other racial and ethnic 
communities (4). Although hospitalization rates were lower 
for Hispanic persons than for black and white persons, hos￾pitalized Hispanic patients were more likely to be younger 
(aged <44 years) (4). It has been hypothesized that Hispanic 
adults might be at increased risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection 
because they are overrepresented in frontline (e.g., essential 
and direct-service) occupations with decreased opportunities 
for social distancing, which might also affect children living 
in those households (4). During the 2009 influenza A H1N1 
pandemic, pediatric mortality rates also were higher among 
underrepresented ethnic groups in a study from England (5).

§ Data are preliminary, and case counts and rates for recent hospital admissions 
are subject to lag. As data are received each week, prior case counts and rates 
are updated accordingly. As of July 25, 2020, 50 (8.7%) of 576 pediatric 
hospitalized cases were missing data on race and ethnicity.
¶ Rates are not shown among non-Hispanic Asian or Pacific Islanders and non￾Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Natives because of small case counts, leading 
to unstable estimates. All non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Native 
hospitalized children were aged 5–17 years.
Forty-two percent of children in this analysis had one or 
more underlying medical conditions, with higher prevalences 
among Hispanic and black children. This suggests that the 
presence of underlying conditions place children at higher risk 
for COVID-19-associated hospitalizations and that observed 
disparities might in part be related to the higher prevalence 
of underlying conditions among hospitalized Hispanic and 
black children compared with those among white children. 
This study, along with other studies of hospitalized children 
with COVID-19, found that obesity was the most prevalent 
underlying medical condition (6,7). Childhood obesity affects 
almost one in five U.S. children and is more prevalent in 
black and Hispanic children (8); therefore, understanding the 
underlying pathophysiologic association between obesity and 
SARS-CoV-2 infection is important to identifying possible 
clinical interventions and preventive strategies to reduce the 
risk for hospitalization.
This report and others have found that, although one third 
of children hospitalized with COVID-19 were admitted to the 
ICU, the case-fatality rate remains low, even among children 
hospitalized with more severe COVID-19–associated com￾plications, such as MIS-C (6,7,9). By comparison, among 
U.S. children hospitalized with seasonal influenza virus 
infection, estimates of ICU admissions have ranged from 
16% to 25% among hospitalized children without and with 
underlying medical conditions, respectively, and reports of 
in-hospital deaths also are rare (<1%) (10). The percentage 
of ICU admission was similar among children (33.2%) and 
adults (32.0%) reported to COVID-NET; however, invasive 
mechanical ventilation was required less frequently in children 
(5.8%) than in adults (18.6%) (3). Continued monitoring 
of hospitalizations, ICU admissions, and mortality among 
children is important to understand potential risk factors for 
severe outcomes.
The findings in this report are subject to at least five 
limitations. First, laboratory confirmation is dependent on 
clinician-ordered SARS-CoV-2 molecular testing. Rates

likely are underestimates; cases can be missed because of test 
availability, test performance, and provider or facility testing 
practices. Second, hospitalization rates by age group and race/
ethnicity are preliminary and might change as additional cases 
are identified during the surveillance period. Third, analysis 
of interventions, treatments, and outcomes was based on a 
convenience sample of children with a final disposition and 
complete chart reviews. A higher proportion of included chil￾dren were aged <6 months, and two sites contributed more than 
half of cases; however, compared with other single-center or 
state-based studies, COVID-NET is more geographically and 
racially diverse (2). Approximately 60% of pediatric hospital￾izations reported to COVID-NET have not had a chart review, 
and this sample might be biased. In the future, COVID-NET 
plans to have complete, population-based data on hospitalized 
children. Finally, COVID-NET did not systematically col￾lect information on MIS-C until June 18. In addition, given 
that molecular tests can miss approximately half of patients 
with MIS-C despite serologic or epidemiologic evidence of a 
past SARS-CoV-2 infection (9), COVID-NET surveillance 
likely underestimates the percentage of MIS-C cases among 
SARS-CoV-2 infections in children.
Using a multisite, geographically diverse network, this report 
found that children with SARS-CoV-2 infection can have severe 
illness requiring hospitalization and intensive care. Improved 
understanding of the social determinants of health is needed 
to inform and reduce disparities as evidenced by pediatric 
COVID-19-associated hospitalization rates. Similar to the gen￾eral population, children should be encouraged to wash their 
hands often and continue social distancing, and children aged 
≥2 years should wear a mask when around persons outside of 
their families to reduce the risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection and 
transmission to others. Ongoing monitoring of hospitalization 
rates, clinical characteristics, ICU admission, and outcomes in 
the pediatric population is important to further characterize the 
morbidity and mortality of COVID-19 in children.
