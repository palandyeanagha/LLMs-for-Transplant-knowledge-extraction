vein in coronary artery bypass grafting
Shao-Zhong Zhang, Guo-Xiang Wang* and Xiao-Tong Zhou
Abstract
Background: The present study aimed to summarize the clinical application of microincision vein harvesting (MVH)
of the great saphenous vein in coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).
Methods: From July 2014 to October 2017, 160 patients underwent coronary artery bypass grafting. Among them,
80 patients received MVH of the great saphenous vein, and 80 received open venous harvesting (OVH). The results
of the sampling operation, complications during hospitalization, and the long-term patency of the great saphenous
vein were compared between the two groups.
Results: All the patients in both groups received successful operations. The difference in the length of the veins
obtained and the injury of the veins was not statistically significant (P > 0.05). The difference in the long-term
patency rate of the graft vessels between the two groups was not statistically significant. The in-hospital mortality
rate was the same in both groups. The MVH group had noticeable advantages over the OVH group in terms of the
vein collection times, the incision length, and the complications experienced when performing the leg incisions
(P < 0.01). The time relating to the patients’ observed early out-of-bed activity was significantly longer in the MVH
group. Furthermore, the patients’ hospitalization length was significantly shorter in the MVH group compared to
the OVH group (P < 0.05). The MVH group had significant advantages in pain score and patient satisfaction, and this
difference was also statistically significant (P < 0.05).
Conclusions: The MVH procedure met the requirements of CABG in vein grafting. When compared with OVH, MVH
can significantly reduce leg incision complications and improve patients’ overall satisfaction with their hospital
experience.

Background
Coronary heart disease (CHD) is a serious risk to an indi￾vidual’s health and wellbeing with a continuously increasing
incidence rate. Treatments of CHD mainly comprise drug
treatment, stent implantation, and surgical treatment. Fur￾thermore, CHD patients undergo coronary artery bypass
grafting (CABG) when they experience medical treatment
failures and the recurrent challenge of unstable angina.
CABG is the most effective surgical procedure for the treat￾ment of CHD. This is particularly evident for patients who
are experiencing ineffective results from their medical treat￾ment for severe coronary artery trunk disease, severe sten￾osis of triple-vessel, or severe diffuse stenosis of double￾vessel [1, 2]. In particular, these patients undergo a CABG
procedure when their coronary angiography reveals more
than 50% stenosis of the left main trunk or more than 75%

stenosis of two vessels, more than 75% stenosis of three ves￾sels or multiple diffuse lesions [3].
The vessels used for bypass grafting in CABG are
mainly the internal thoracic artery, great saphenous vein
(GSV), radial, or gastroepiploic artery. In China, it is
more common to use the GSV [4]. However, the inci￾dence of graft vessel obstruction, poor wound healing,
and sensory skin abnormalities caused by open vein har￾vesting (OVH) of the GSV is relatively high [5]. At
present, some hospitals in major cities are gradually pro￾moting the method of harvesting the GSV under endos￾copy, which presents important advantages and
disadvantages. The main disadvantages include high
wastage and high operation costs, which make it difficult
for the procedure to be carried out in many prefecture￾level municipal tertiary hospitals. Microincision vein
harvesting (MVH) is a recently emerging surgical tech￾nique, where the main operation is to release GSV from
two ends of the microincision. MVH of the GSV has the
advantages of being a treatment that only involves a
small trauma region, so ensures a fast recovery, a short
duration procedure, well-performed incisions, and a low
operation cost [6]. MVH of the GSV is considered simi￾lar to no-touch technology [7, 8]; therefore, it is grad￾ually being adopted in many hospitals in China. MVH is
additionally becoming the preferred method as a result
of the simple equipment used in MVH technology,
mainly including head-mounted lights, venous hooks,
and titanium metal clips. Another advantage is that an
endoscope is not used during this procedure. Emerging
evidence shows that MVH of the GSV has more clinical
benefits than methods of traditional incisions for har￾vesting the GSV, as this method is safer and has signifi￾cantly lower complications of the wound [9–11].
To evaluate the beneficial characteristics of MVH over
OVH, we used both surgical techniques on CABG pa￾tients. The prognostic indexes, including reducing ven￾ous vascular injury, leg complications, and adverse
psychological conditions in patients after the operation,
were studied retrospectively.
Methods
Patients
From July 2014 to October 2017, 160 patients who
underwent CABG were recruited. The study protocol
was approved by the Medicine Ethics Committee and
was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of
Helsinki. Furthermore, all patients provided informed
consent prior to enrollment into the study.
Study design
These patients were divided into two groups: the MVH
group and the OVH group (n = 80, both). Patients in the
MVH group were treated with MVH, and patients in the
OVH group were treated with OVH. Patients requiring
emergency surgery, or who had severe varicose veins of
the lower extremities, or who required total artery by￾pass were excluded (the clinical data is presented in
Table 1).
Interventions
In the MVH group, head-mounted surgical magnifiers,
titanium metal clips, and two venous hooks were used
for the operation. The MVH procedure includes mostly
fine operations, so surgeons consider it a learning curve
[12]. During the operation, incorrect actions can damage
the intimal epithelium of venous vessels, induce autolo￾gous coagulation dysfunction, or result in poor autolo￾gous remodeling, causing the possibility of early stenosis
or occlusion of venous bypass vessels [13]. Therefore, in
selecting the GSV, we need to follow the principle that
the ratio of the diameter of the bypass vessel freed to the
diameter of the target vessel is ≤2.8; bypass vessels are
smooth and have few collateral branches [7, 13, 14].
Meanwhile, skilled surgical techniques and a clear un￾derstanding of vascular anatomy are prerequisites for
obtaining complete, smooth, and high-quality veins.
There were three commonly performed microincisions
in the MVH group, including the incision above the
ankle joint (1.5 cm), the incision below the knee joint (1.5
cm), and the incision between the knee and the ankle joint
(2 cm) (Fig. 1). The GSV from above the ankle joint to
below the knee joint was efficiently freed. Two venous
hooks were implanted into the incision above the ankle
joint, and the anterior and posterior space of the GSV was
freed. Furthermore, in the region near the distal end of
the collateral branch, the branches were amputated by
electrocoagulation with a long electric knife, and then the
GSV was gradually freed. Thereafter, the vein trunk was
amputated and ligated below the knee joint, and the GSV
was pulled out. The proximal collateral end of the vein
was clamped with titanium clips. Under direct inspection,
the veins were expanded, and the branches were proc￾essed for future use.
Conversely, in the OVH group, conventional surgical in￾struments and routine surgical techniques were used to
complete the operation. In short, this included performing
an incision on all skin in the affected region along with
completing the projection of the GSV on the surface.
Thereafter, the vein was freed, and the branches were li￾gated. The vein was additionally retained for future use.
GSVs freed by the two methods were used as bypass
vascular bridges to anastomose target vessels with con￾ventional CABG techniques. In simple terms, the patient
lay in a supine position, with single-lumen endotracheal
intubation and vein anesthesia applied and the chest and
lower extremities exposed. Thoracotomy was performed
in the middle of the sternum, and the free internal

mammary artery was used as an anterior descending
branch bridge vessel to reveal the diseased coronary ves￾sels. The free bridge vessel with the distal end of the anter￾ior descending branch, blunt edge branch, and posterior
descending branch, the proximal end of the bridge vessel,
and the ascending aorta line-by-side were anastomosed.
After exhausting the blood vessels in the bridge and
checking for no bleeding, the patency of the bridge blood
vessels can be detected with an arterial blood flow meter.
Data collection
During the operation, ultrasound was used to locate bypass
vessels for flow monitoring to ensure the patency of venous
graft vessels. The time, length, and injury of the veins ob￾tained were also recorded during the procedure. After the
operation, the incision and complications, including
incision exudation, skin ecchymosis, subcutaneous
hematoma, incision infection, and lower limb edema, were
observed and recorded. The preoperative cardiac function,
the degree of coronary artery disease, the proportions of
diabetes mellitus and varicose veins of the lower extrem￾ities, the time of early ambulation, hospitalization length,
and the in-hospital mortality rate were compared between
the two groups. During the in-hospital and postoperative
follow-ups, the visual analog scale was used to evaluate the
degree of pain experienced by the patients.
A retrospective study of the surgical techniques be￾tween the two groups was performed within 4 years after
CABG, based on the long-term patency rate of the GSV
and the results of the follow-up session. The presence
and degree of stenosis of the graft vessels were analyzed
by coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA)

or coronary angiography, and stenosis of a 50% vascular
diameter was used as the standard: > 50% stenosis indi￾cated poor long-term patency.
Statistical analysis
The data was statistically analyzed using the statistical
software SPSS19.0. Count data was expressed as the fre￾quency (rate/proportion) and evaluated using an X2
-test.
The measurement data was expressed as mean ± stand￾ard deviation (x ± SD) and evaluated using the t-test. In
addition, normally distributed data was expressed as me￾dian and evaluated using a rank-sum test. A result of
P < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant.
Results
Demographic data
There were no significant differences in age, gender, or
body mass index between the MVH group and the OVH
group (n = 80, both) (Table 1). All the patients in both
groups received successful operations.
Perioperative outcomes
The time for harvesting the vein and the length of the in￾cision was shorter in the MVH group. Complications in
patients’ legs after the operation were also fewer in the
MVH group than in the OVH group, and these differences
were statistically significant (P < 0.01). The difference in
the rupture of veins needing suture between the two
groups was not statistically significant, whereas the length
of veins obtained in both groups was similar (P > 0.05).
There was no significant difference in the length of veins
freed and the number of wounded sites in the veins be￾tween the two groups; therefore, the differences were not
statistically significant (P > 0.05). The rates of incision in￾fection, lower limb edema, and hospitalization stay were
greater in the OVH group than in the MVH group (P <
0.05, Table 2).
Angiographic outcomes
Two methods were evaluated by angiography. The re￾sults are as follows (Fig. 2 and Fig. 3).
Follow-up results
The long-term patency rate of the GSV was compared,
resulting in a lack of significant statistical difference ob￾served. The difference in the long-term patency of graft
vessels between the MVH group and OVH group was
not statistically significant; the difference in the degree
of vascular injury between the two groups was also not
statistically significant (Table 3).
Discussion
In this study, we compared the results of the sampling
operation, complications during hospitalization, and the
long-term patency of the great saphenous vein between
the two groups. Results showed that the MVH group
had noticeable advantages over the OVH group in terms
of the vein collection times, the incision length, and the
complications experienced when performing the leg inci￾sions (P < 0.01). Furthermore, the patients’ early out-of￾bed activity, hospitalization length, pain score, and pa￾tient satisfaction in the MVH group were significantly
better than in the OVH group (P < 0.05).
The MVH group had significant advantages over the
OVH group in the time taken to obtain the veins, the in￾cision length, and the vein quality (P < 0.01). These dif￾ferences were statistically significant. The OVH method
using an endoscope mainly collects veins from the free
saphenous vein above the knee to the groin. It is difficult
to place the endoscope under the knee, due to the

excessive subcutaneous tension of the calf. It may also
damage the saphenous vein intima, which is not condu￾cive to obtaining veins compared with the MVH
method. Moreover, the cost of endoscopic vein collec￾tion is high, the steps are cumbersome, and the available
value MVH group has the same effect. In the MVH
group, the freed blood vessels met the requirements of
conventional CABG by presenting a shortened operation
time, accelerated early out-of-bed activity of patients
after the operation, and the reduced psychological bur￾den affecting patients. For obese patients, lower extrem￾ity subcutaneous tissue is relatively loose, providing an
easily established surgical tunnel. However, in patients
with thin and tight skin, many small branches of vessels
present the challenge of smaller surgical tunnels result￾ing in the inability of carbon dioxide to fill the subcuta￾neous space to induce subcutaneous emphysema. This
increases the difficulty of the operation to a certain ex￾tent, thus affecting the quality of the veins. In the MVH
group, surgeons should operate carefully and have a
clear understanding of vascular anatomy. Titanium
metal clips or electrocoagulation hooks should be used
to close, ligate, and cut off the distal end of the adventi￾tia and branches of venous vessels. Surgeons should at￾tempt to avoid damaging the adventitia or angulation
and prevent the forming of manual stenosis, which may
cause a low long-term patency rate.
A follow-up study was carried out based on long-term
follow-ups of 160 patients with CABG, using CTA or cor￾onary angiography. The patency of graft vessels in the two
GSV groups collected by the two methods within 4 years
after the operation was analyzed and studied. The results
revealed that the difference in the degree of stenosis of
graft vessels between the MVH group and the OVH group
was not statistically significant and the degree of injury to
vascular intima in the two groups was similar. These fur￾ther revealed that the vascular injury or long-term patency
of freed GSV between the two groups were alike.
The incidences of leg wound pain, exudation, edema, in￾cision infection, and cutaneous nerve injury were signifi￾cantly lower in the MVH group than in the OVH group
(P < 0.05). These results revealed that after MVH, patients
subjectively reported feeling a small incision, rapid recovery,
no bleeding, no obvious numbness, and normal activity
when compared with conventional OVH. This, in turn, im￾proved their satisfaction with their hospital treatment. The
results of the present study further confirm the feasibility
and authenticity of previous studies. MVH has a significant
effect and is worthy of popularization. Furthermore, in the
MVH group, fewer traumas and less bleeding were ob￾served in the subcutaneous incision. Three incisions were
less than 2 cm, and the incidence of lower-limb edema was
also much lower than in the OVH group. This suggests that
MVH can also reduce the compression bandage time.
In the OVH group, varying degrees of complications
occurred in leg wounds in approximately one-third of
the patients, which affected early activities and pro￾longed their hospitalization stay [15].
There are some limitations to MVH. First, although
there is no significant difference between the two in
terms of vascular patency on the bridge angiography
after CABG, further study is required into the molecular
changes of venous intima damage, and whether there is
any effect on shortening the use of clinical antiplatelet
aggregation drugs. Second, for some elderly patients,
due to the excessive number of branches in their great
saphenous veins, deep and large venous sinuses, exces￾sively thin blood vessel diameters, and other objective
factors, MVH acquisition may need to be converted to
conventional methods. Finally, MVH is more difficult to
master and involves something of a learning curve. It
may take some time to obtain the saphenous vein from
three small microincisions under certain conditions.
Conclusions
This study revealed that the MVH operation used simple
surgical equipment at a cost-effective price. Furthermore,
after a significant period of knowledge acquisition and
practice of the MVH procedure, high levels of procedural
success can be achieved, while reducing the disadvantages
of a complicated procedure, the high cost, and the large
equipment wastage to a significant extent when compared
to harvesting the vein under an endoscope [12, 16].
Patients are also more willing to accept less painful, less
expensive, and less invasive surgical methods.
