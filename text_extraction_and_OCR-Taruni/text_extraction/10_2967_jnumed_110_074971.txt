Despite widespread prophylactic use of implantable cardi￾overter defibrillator (ICD) therapy, sudden cardiac death and
refractory arrhythmia events are still important clinical issues to
be overcome. We examined whether the impairment of cardiac
sympathetic innervation and myocardial perfusion is respon￾sible for lethal arrhythmic events and has prognostic value by
comparing conventional clinical indices. Methods: In con￾secutive ICDs implanted in 60 patients, cardiac uptake of 123I￾metaiodobenzylguanidine and 99mTc-tetrofosmin at rest was
quantified, and then patients were prospectively followed with
endpoints of appropriate ICD shocks or cardiac death. Cardiac
metaiodobenzylguanidine activity was quantified as a heart-to￾mediastinum ratio (HMR), and impaired tetrofosmin uptake was
graded as a summed score (SS) using a computerized techni￾que with a percentage of tracer uptake. Results: During a mean
29-mo interval, ICD shock was documented in 30 patients
(50%); 3 cardiac deaths were also observed in this group of
patients. Patients with ICD shocks had a significantly smaller
HMR and a greater SS than did those without (1.73 6 0.34 vs.
2.06 6 0.46, P 5 0.003, and 18.0 6 16.2 vs. 5.7 6 4.4, P 5
0.001, respectively). Kaplan–Meier analysis showed that
patients who had both an HMR of 1.90 or less and an SS of
12 or greater had a significantly greater ICD discharge rate than
did those who had both an HMR greater than 1.90 and an SS
less than 12 (94% vs. 18%, P , 0.005) (log rank, 15.14; P ,
0.0005). Multivariate analysis with a Cox model identified the
greatest Wald x2 of 6.454 and a hazard ratio of 3.857 (P 5
0.011) when an HMR of 1.9 or less and tetrofosmin SS of 12
or greater were combined. Conclusion: Impairment of cardiac
sympathetic innervation and myocardial perfusion is related to
lethal arrhythmic events leading to sudden death, and the com￾bined assessment of these can identify patients for whom pro￾phylactic ICD use has the greatest potential.

Prophylactic use of implantable cardioverter defibrilla￾tors (ICDs) is established in patients with depressed left
ventricular function or symptomatic heart failure at a high
risk of life-threatening ventricular tachyarrhythmias (1,2).
Widespread use of ICD therapy, however, has increased the
number of patients, medical costs, and also unfavorable
effects related to this device, especially in patients at a
lower risk for sudden cardiac death (3). The American
College of Cardiology, American Heart Association, and
North American Society for Pacing and Electrophysiology
2002 guideline for ICD implantation (4,5) states that the
careful selection of patients for ICD therapy is crucial from
scientific, practical, and economic points of view. Invasive
electrophysiologic study does not necessarily provide in￾formation on the appropriate selection of patients for ICD
therapy (6), whereas history of syncope, lethal ventricular
tachyarrhythmias, and recovery from cardiopulmonary re￾suscitation are shown to be important clinical determinants.
Thus, pathophysiologically based assessment of overall
heart conditions—including triggers, substrates, and mod￾ulators of fatal arrhythmic events—seems to be more rea￾sonable for the indication of ICD therapy than is the
detection of localized electrophysiologic abnormalities
(7). Microcirculation at a myocyte level, myocardial viabil￾ity, or cell injury seems to be principally related to arrhyth￾mogenesis and can be assessed by myocardial perfusion
tracer activity (8,9). Electrophysiologic instability is an im￾portant trigger of cardiac arrhythmias and is modulated by
autonomic function (10,11). Cardiac sympathetic innerva￾tion and function can be assessed by quantification of 123I￾Received Jan. 20, 2010; revision accepted Mar. 11, 2010.

metaiodobenzylguanidine activity (12). Previous studies
(12–20) have shown that alterations of cardiac metaiodo￾benzylguanidine kinetics closely correlate with lethal
events and long-term mortality in patients with left ventric￾ular dysfunction or heart failure. However, whether altered
cardiac sympathetic innervation predicts future lethal ar￾rhythmic events was not fully investigated. From our earlier
results (12,20) on the limited possibility of cardiac neuro￾imaging, we hypothesized that both impairment of myocar￾dial perfusion or cell viability and sympathetic innervation
are responsible for arrhythmogenesis. This study investi￾gated prognostic implications of cardiac activities of meta￾iodobenzylguanidine and perfusion tracer in patients treated
with prophylactic use of ICD by correlation with lethal
arrhythmic events prospectively documented.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Population
This study enrolled 60 consecutive patients (mean age, 53 y; 41
men and 19 women) who had undergone ICD treatment. The
presenting study protocol was based on the guidelines for ICD
implantation of the American Heart Association and American
College of Cardiology or on standard clinical criteria, such as
survival from cardiopulmonary resuscitation or the presence of
spontaneous or inducible ventricular fibrillation or refractory life￾threatening ventricular tachyarrhythmias independent of left ven￾tricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and etiology. No patients, however,
had acute ischemic events at least several months before ICD
implantation. ICDs (Micro Jewel II, GEM, and GEM II [Medtronics
Inc.] or VENTAK MINI IV [Guidant Inc.]) were implanted using a
subclavian venous approach. Informed consent for ICD implanta￾tion and participation in this study was obtained following the
guidelines of the ethics committee of our hospital. The present study
population included 23 patients who had been also enrolled in our
previous study (20). The clinical backgrounds, underlying cardiac
diseases, and quantitative data listed in Table 1 were obtained at a
stable clinical condition under appropriate medical treatment,
within a few days of cardiac metaiodobenzylguanidine imaging,
before discharge for a long-term follow-up at an outpatient clinic.
Cardiac Sympathetic Nerve and Perfusion Imaging
All patients underwent both cardiac metaiodobenzylguanidine
and tetrofosmin myocardial perfusion imaging within 2 wk of ICD
implantation. Cardiac sympathetic nerve imaging was done using
123I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (111 MBq) with a high specific
activity (Daiichi Radioisotope Laboratories). Cardiac planar and
tomographic metaiodobenzylguanidine images were obtained at
fasting and resting conditions at 15–30 min (early) and 4 h (late)
after an intravenous tracer injection, using a g-camera equipped
with a low-energy general-purpose collimator. Cardiac 123I-meta￾iodobenzylguanidine activity was quantified as a heart-to-media￾stinum ratio (HMR) by manually setting a region of interest on an
upper mediastinum and whole cardiac region on a planar image.
Because of the elimination of background or lung activity, wash￾out kinetics of metaiodobenzylguanidine activity from the heart
were calculated using tomographic data (12,14–20). This method
was reported to have a high reproducibility in our previous studies.
Myocardial perfusion imaging was performed at rest using 99mTc-labeled tetrofosmin (760 MBq) at 60 min after an intra￾venous tracer injection. Electrocardiogram (ECG)-gated SPECT
data were obtained for 60 s per projection from 60 projections
during a 360 rotation, with a frame rate of 8, using a 3-head
g-camera with a low-energy, high-resolution parallel-hole colli￾mator and a Butterworth filter (cutoff, 0.24 cycle/pixel; power
factor, 8) (GCA 9300-A/DI; Toshiba). Data were stored in a
64 · 64 word matrix nuclear medicine computer system, and no
attenuation or scatter correction was performed. LVEF, left ven￾tricular end-diastolic volume, and left ventricular end-systolic vol￾ume were calculated from 3-dimensional gated SPECT data using
a dedicated computer program, p-FAST (21,22). An automated
scoring system developed in our laboratory (21) calculated myo￾cardial tetrofosmin activity as a summed score (SS) at 25 left
ventricular segments on a polar map, using a relative peak count
(percentage uptake) as follows: 4, less than 40%; 3, 40%–49%;
2, 50%–59%; 1, 60%–69%; and 0, 70% or more.
Follow-up Protocol
After discharge, all patients were followed by cardiologists at
least every 3 mo for a mean of 29 mo at an outpatient pacemaker
clinic of our university hospital. The primary endpoint was fatal or
near-fatal cardiac events consisting of cardiac death, appropriate
ICD discharge against lethal ventricular arrhythmias, life-threat￾ening ventricular tachyarrhythmias, and recovery from cardiopul￾monary resuscitation. Drug therapy for arrhythmias, background
diseases, or heart failure used at the start of the study was
continued for as long as no adverse effects emerged (Table 1).
Amiodarone, sotalol, class I antiarrhythmic drugs, or b-blockers
were used, when indicated. Diuretics, digoxin, angiotensin
converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, or
b-blockers were also used for heart failure. The appropriateness
of ICD shock against sustained lethal ventricular tachycardia or
fibrillation was confirmed by ECG recordings or an ICD built-in
memory system.
Statistics
Statistical values are shown as mean 6 SD. Mean values
between 2 groups were compared using the unpaired t test, and
prevalence was compared using a x2 test. A P value of less than
0.05 was considered significant. Receiver-operating-characteristic
analysis was performed to determine optimal cutoff values of
HMR and SS for primary endpoints (Fig. 1). Survival curves of
a subgroup of patients were created using the Kaplan–Meier
method to clarify the time-dependent cumulative event-free rate
and were compared using the log-rank test. Univariate and multi￾variate analyses with a Cox proportional hazards model were per￾formed using a computer statistical program package (SPSS,
version 11.0; SPSS Inc.).
RESULTS
Clinical Backgrounds
During a follow-up period, ICD discharges were
documented in 30 patients (50%), in whom 3 cardiac
deaths due to congestive heart failure were observed. No
patients had acute myocardial infarction, acute coronary
syndrome, or recovery from cardiopulmonary resuscita￾tion during this follow-up period. There was no signifi￾cant difference in age, sex, underlying cardiac disease,
New York Heart Association class, or follow-up period

between patients with and without events (Table 1).
Patients with cardiac events had a significantly lower
LVEF (42% 6 18% vs. 56% 6 15%, P 5 0.002), a sig￾nificantly larger left ventricular end-diastolic diameter
(57 6 11 vs. 50 6 11 mm, P 5 0.017), and a significantly
greater brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) level (209 6 198
vs. 101 6 140, P 5 0.018) than did those without.
Patients with lethal events also had a significantly greater
prevalence of sustained ventricular tachycardia (60% vs.
27%, P 5 0.0172) than did those without. However, for
the electrophysiologic study there was no significant dif￾ference in prevalence of ventricular fibrillation or non￾sustained ventricular tachycardia and in inducibility of
lethal tachyarrhythmias between the groups. Patients
with cardiac events received spironolactone, b-blockers,
angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin
II receptor blockers, and class III antiarrhythmic drugs
more frequently than did those without.
Cardiac Metaiodobenzylguanidine and Gated
SPECT Data
Patients with lethal events had significantly reduced
cardiac metaiodobenzylguanidine activities, compared with
those without (1.96 6 0.26 vs. 2.16 6 0.37, P 5 0.019, for
early HMR and 1.73 6 0.34 vs. 2.06 6 0.46, P 5 0.003, for
late HMR [Table 2]). However, there was no signifi￾cant difference in metaiodobenzylguanidine washout rate
between the groups. The event group had a significantly
greater SS, a significantly smaller LVEF, and significantly

left ventricular end-systolic volume.
Event Rates and Cardiac Uptake of
Metaiodobenzylguanidine and Tetrofosmin
Receiver-operating-characteristic analysis was performed
using cardiac metaiodobenzylguanidine activity (late HMR)
and myocardial perfusion abnormality (tetrofosmin SS);
analysis also determined optimal cutoff values for the
identification of a high-risk group (1.90 for a late HMR
of cardiac metaiodobenzylguanidine activity and 12 for
tetrofosmin SS) (Fig. 1). Two thresholds were used to
divide the patients into the following 3 groups: patients
with a late HMR of 1.90 or more and an SS less than 12
(preserved metaiodobenzylguanidine activity and tetrofos￾min uptake), patients with a late HMR less than 1.90 and an
SS less than 12 (reduced metaiodobenzylguanidine activity
but preserved tetrofosmin uptake), and patients with a late
HMR less than 1.90 and an SS of 12 or more (reduced
metaiodobenzylguanidine activity and tetrofosmin uptake).
There was no patient with an HMR of 1.90 or more and a
SS of 12 or more. The group with impaired uptake of meta￾iodobenzylguanidine and tetrofosmin had a significantly
greater event rate (94%) than did the other 2 groups (45%
for the group with impaired uptake of metaiodobenzylgua￾nidine and preserved uptake of tetrofosmin [P , 0.05] and
18% for the group with preserved uptake of both metaio￾dobenzylguanidine and tetrofosmin [P , 0.005]) (Fig. 2).
In addition, the group with impaired uptake of metaiodo￾benzylguanidine and tetrofosmin had a significantly lower
event-free rate than did the group with impaired metaiodo￾benzylguanidine and preserved tetrofosmin uptake (log
rank, 6.14; P 5 0.0132) or the group with preserved uptake
of both metaiodobenzylguanidine and tetrofosmin (log
rank, 15.14; P 5 0.0001) (Fig. 3).
Event-Rate Analysis in Patients with Preserved
Cardiac Function
Because 31 of 60 patients had an LVEF of 50% or more,
event-rate analysis was performed only in this patient
population. The group with impaired uptake of both
metaiodobenzylguanidine and tetrofosmin had a signifi￾cantly (P , 0.05) higher event rate (100%) than did the
other 2 groups (30% for the group with impaired metaio￾dobenzylguanidine activity and preserved tetrofosmin uptake
and 16% for the group with preserved uptake of both meta￾iodobenzylguanidine and tetrofosmin) (Fig. 4). Likewise,
the group with impaired uptake of both metaiodobenzyl￾guanidine and tetrofosmin had the lowest event-free rate
among the 3 groups (log rank, 6.06; P 5 0.0138) (Fig. 5).

Univariate and Multivariate Analyses
BNP level, a metaiodobenzylguanidine HMR of 1.9 or
less, a tetrofosmin SS of 12 or more, and LVEF were
chosen for further multivariate analysis with a Cox model,
on the basis of the univariate analysis results (Table 3) in
combination with the cutoff values of HMR and tetrofos￾min SS (Fig. 1). The greatest Wald x2 of 6.454 and a hazard
ratio of 3.857 (P 5 0.011) were identified when an HMR of
1.9 or less and a tetrofosmin SS of 12 or more were com￾bined (Table 3).
Patient Presentations
Figure 6 shows planar metaiodobenzylguanidine and
tetrofosmin images and SPECT images of 2 typical patients
with and without lethal arrhythmic events. The patient who
had markedly reduced metaiodobenzylguanidine activity
and profound perfusion abnormality had several ICD
shocks against an electrical storm of ventricular tachyar￾rhythmias 3 mo after ICD implantation, whereas the patient
with preservation of metaiodobenzylguanidine activity and
myocardial perfusion had neither ICD shock nor other car￾diac events for 30 mo.
DISCUSSION
The present results clearly demonstrated the incremental
benefits of combined assessment of myocardial perfusion
and sympathetic nerve function for appropriate risk strat￾ification of patients who are likely to need prophylactic
ICD therapy.

Myocardial Perfusion Assessment
and Arrhythmogenicity
Organic tissue injury or sustained perfusion abnormality
is responsible for fatal arrhythmic events, probably because
of the function of substrate for arrhythmogenicity such as
reentrant circuit and abnormal automaticity (23,24). A
decrease in myocardial perfusion tracer uptake at rest indi￾cates sustained impairment of microcirculation, organic tis￾sue injury, or adenosine triphosphate depletion state (10).
These findings support the rationale for the assessment of
myocardial perfusion tracer uptake in patients at lethal
arrhythmic event risk. The present study quantified myo￾cardial activity of 99mTc-labeled tetrofosmin to evaluate
myocardial perfusion abnormality, viability, and tissue
injury using the computerized automated scoring system
with a polar-map technique (21,22).
Assessment of Cardiac Sympathetic Innervation
and Arrhythmogenicity
Lethal arrhythmias occur at the end of pathophysiologic
cascades because of complex interactions between struc￾tural injury and altered autonomic function (25). Altera￾tions of autonomic tones, electrolyte imbalance, and
hormonal factors are responsible for arrhythmogenesis
(23,26). A recent preliminary study (27) suggested the
arrhythmogenicity of regional metaiodobenzylguanidine
defect. Compared with invasive testing (20,28), however,
signal-averaged ECG, T-wave alternans, QT dispersion, and
heart rate variability are noted as more sensitive markers
(29–32), because electrophysiologic inducibility of ventric￾ular tachyarrhythmias is not necessarily related to clinically
documented arrhythmic events or outcomes. Although
appropriate ICD shocks most likely occur when patients
have both reduced cardiac metaiodobenzylguanidine activ￾ity and depressed heart rate variability (12), electrophysio￾logic indices vary over short intervals, dependent on
artifacts, rhythm disturbance, and noncardiac autonomic
tone (33). In our previous study (20), electrophysiologic
inducibility of lethal ventricular tachyarrhythmias and sig￾nal-averaged ECG indices, when compared with cardiac
metaiodobenzylguanidine activity, were not independent

significant predictors of lethal arrhythmic events. In this
study, metaiodobenzylguanidine washout rate was not a
dominant predictor of events. Metaiodobenzylguanidine
washout rate is a functional marker of cardiac sympathetic
tone when an initial uptake of metaiodobenzylguanidine
is preserved to some extent and when extraneuronal com￾ponents are excluded. Washout rate is, however, overesti￾mated significantly when cardiac metaiodobenzylguanidine
uptake is globally depressed, as often observed in patients
with extensive myocardial injury or severe heart failure. In
contrast, late HMR is determined both by an initial meta￾iodobenzylguanidine uptake (sympathetic innervation and
uptake-1 system) and by washout rate, which is regulated
by central stimulation, norepinephrine release, reuptake,
and spillover. Thus, late HMR can express overall cardiac
presynaptic innervation and function, making this method a
more reliable prognostic marker than washout rate.
Risk Stratification Using Metaiodobenzylguanidine
Activity in Combination with Myocardial Perfusion
Postinfarction sympathetic denervation assessed by car￾diac metaiodobenzylguanidine activity is shown to be
arrhythmogenic (24); in addition, experimentally dener￾vated but viable myocardium is supersensitive to catechol￾amine and arrhythmogenesis because of electrophysiologic
instability (34). These findings support the rationale for the
combined use of metaiodobenzylguanidine and perfusion
tracer for the improvement of risk stratification in patients
at lethal arrhythmic event risk, for the appropriate selection
of prophylactic ICD candidates and prediction of efficacy
of ICD treatment.
Left ventricular systolic dysfunction is a powerful
predictor of major cardiac events in coronary patients and
in heart failure patients but is not necessarily related to
lethal arrhythmic events (35,36). Long-term benefits of ICD
are shown to be limited independent of LVEF (37,38). Sim￾ilarly, this study demonstrated that the imaging technique
effectively risk-stratified patients independently of LVEF.
In contrast to our previous findings (14,15,18,20), plasma
BNP level and LVEF were unlikely to provide additional
benefits to prognosis assessment by cardiac metaiodoben￾zylguanidine or perfusion technique. There are several pos￾sible explanations. First, LVEF and New York Heart
Association functional class were relatively well preserved;
second, the endpoint was lethal arrhythmic events but not
limited to cardiac death alone; third, impaired diastolic
performance, which is often overlooked in heart failure
patients, may be related to lethal arrhythmic events; and
finally, cardiac metaiodobenzylguanidine activity had sub￾stantially powerful prognostic values, particularly in com￾bination with myocardial perfusion assessment in this study
population. Thus, myocardial tissue injury and altered
autonomic innervation identified by perfusion tracer and
metaiodobenzylguanidine activities are closely and comple￾mentarily related to unfavorable outcomes.
Study Limitations
This study assessed global, but not regional, cardiac
metaiodobenzylguanidine activity and did not evaluate
autonomic heterogeneity or localization of arrhythmoge￾nicity. When cardiac metaiodobenzylguanidine activity is
regionally, but not globally, impaired—as seen in patients
with coronary artery disease without severe heart failure—
regional SPECT analysis is possible (17,27). It is, however,
difficult to reconstruct SPECT data (27) in the case of glob￾ally defective metaiodobenzylguanidine uptake, which is
often seen in patients with severe heart failure or left ven￾tricular dysfunction. Furthermore, the lower the global
metaiodobenzylguanidine activity is, the poorer a patient’s
prognosis becomes (18). It is also known that cardiac meta￾iodobenzylguanidine uptake is underestimated at inferior
and apical walls without definitive myocardial damage,
probably for attenuation and physiologic reasons (17,39).
Although this technical problem lowers the efficacy of
SPECT for prognostic assessment, precise segment-to-seg￾ment metaiodobenzylguanidine analysis using a high-qual￾ity SPECT image may be able to provide information for
prognosis and globally assessed cardiac metaiodobenzyl￾guanidine activity (27,40). Because this study focused on
lethal events under ICD treatment in cardiology practice,
patients were consecutively enrolled to reduce selection
bias. As a result, patient backgrounds varied and the heter￾ogeneity may have affected the presented results. Despite

these limitations, the presented results revealed prognostic
efficacies of the assessment of both cardiac sympathetic
innervation and myocardial perfusion and suggest the pos￾sibility of this method for determining ICD indication in
real-world clinical settings, independently of various clin￾ical backgrounds. A cost-benefit analysis is also an impor￾tant practical issue. If the nuclear techniques are used for
appropriate selection of ICD candidates, not only the over￾use but also the underuse of ICD could be avoided and the
assessment could be more cost-effective. Cardiac metaio￾dobenzylguanidine activity might alter during clinical
course observation, depending on disease process or treat￾ments. It remains to be clarified when and how long cardiac
metaiodobenzylguanidine activity should be followed up in
patients at high risk for sudden cardiac death. Finally, the
presented results emphasize the need for a multicenter
study with a larger sample size and a longer follow-up
interval for establishing the clinical implications of the pre￾sented technique.
CONCLUSION
Impaired cardiac sympathetic innervation and myocar￾dial perfusion abnormality are related to lethal arrhythmic
events leading to sudden death. Thus, the combined
imaging techniques using a neurotransmitter analog and a
perfusion tracer can provide crucial information not only on
myocardial arrhythmogenesis but also on the selection of
patients at greater risk for sudden death, for most reason￾able candidates of prophylactic ICD use.
