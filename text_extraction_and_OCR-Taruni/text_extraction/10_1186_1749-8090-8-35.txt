Abstract
Background: Post intubation long segment tracheal stenosis is a serious problem which usually requires multiple
methods of treatment. The aim of this study was to evaluate the results of surgical treatment in long segment post
intubation tracheal stenosis.
Methods: Between 2004 to 2008, 20 patients with proximal long segment tracheal stenosis and resection of over
40% of tracheal length, were analyzed in terms of age, sex, clinical symptoms, etiology of stenosis, length of
stenosis and resection, role of suprahyoeid release with bilateral hyoeid bone cutting maneuver, post operative
complications and life quality 3 year after surgery.
Results: M/F was 2/5, with the average age of 23.5 ± 0.5 years. Average length of stenosis was 4.2 ± 0.4 cm and the
average length of resected segment was 5.2 ± 0.4 cm. Early postoperative complications occurred in 4 patients
(20%), 5 patients (25%) had late stenosis and 4 of them were treated with multiple dilation and one patient needed
tracheostomy and prolonged T. tube. We didn’t have any mortality. 80% of patients had excellent surgical results in
follow up period.
Conclusion: Surgery is the best method of treatment in long and multi segment tracheal stenosis.
Keywords: Long segment tracheal stenosis, Surgery, Releasing technique
Background
Benign tracheal stenosis is an acquired inflammatory le￾sion which is mostly due to prolonged intubation and
tracheostomy. Considering high prevalence of road
accidents and head injuries, necessity of prolonged in￾tubation associated with prolonged ICU stay has been
increased, and as a result, these patients usually undergo
tracheostomy. In case of lack of supervision in these
patients, long and segmental tracheal stenosis occurs
that complicates the treatment [1]. Since post intubation
tracheal stenosis is transmural, the best treatment is
resection and primary tracheal reconstruction. Tracheal
releasing maneuvers including release of anterior, poste￾rior portion of trachea and chin to chest stitch are rou￾tinely performed for reconstruction. Suprahyoeid release
can be used in upper stenoses. For resection of distal
lesions, right pulmonary hill releasing technique or right
main bronchi cutting and its anastomosis to the left
bronchi can be performed [2]. Bilateral hyoid bone cut￾ting maneuver is one of the surgical techniques that
used particularly in releasing of the trachea in superior
resections which is mostly performed in long and seg￾mental tracheal resection [3]. The aim of this study was
to evaluate the result of surgical treatment in 20 patients
with long segment post intubation tracheal stenosis and
the role of bilateral hyoid bone cutting with suprahyoid
release technique to facilitate technical considerations.

long segment of trachea 2) bilateral hyoid cutting and rou￾tine releasing maneuver (Suprahyoid releasing maneuver
with anterior and posterior release and chin to chest
sutures) 3) Three years follow up after surgery.
Exclusive criterias: 1) Tracheal stenosis caused by
other etiologies 2) Distal tracheal stenosis 3) Patients
who could not be a proper candidate for tracheal resec￾tion (inoperable patients who were candidate for other
treatment such as stent or T-Tube).
Patients were evaluated in terms of age, sex, clinical
symptoms, etiology of stenosis, pre-operative functional
parameters, length of resected segment, length of stenosis,
additional release of the trachea with this technique, surgi￾cal complications and quality of life. Patients were
followed up to 3 years after surgery (up to 2011).
Patients were divided into 4 different groups according
to the quality of life:
1) Excellent: the patient is able to do all daily activities
and do heavy sport activities and they can speak
normally.
2) Good: the patient is able to do all daily activities but
cannot do heavy sport activities and can speak
normally. 3) Moderate: the patient is symptom-free
only while resting but not able to do normal
activities and can speak normally. 4) Poor: the
patient is not able to breathe without T. Tube or
tracheostomy and cannot speak normally. These
criterias were evaluated every 6 months after the
operation and the last evaluation was quality of life.
(At least 3 years after surgery). All data were
processed by SPSS software, version 11.5.
In supine position with hyperextension of neck and col￾lar incision surgery performed with standard technique of
tracheal resection. After resection of trachea, posterior
and anterior releasing technique and suprahyoid maneu￾ver were performed in all patients prior to anastomosis.
Then the interval between trachea was measured after
head flexion without tracheal traction (A) (Figure 1). After
cutting the two ends of hyoid bone the interval between
proximal and distal of trachea was measured (B) (Figure 2).
A-B = C was evaluated which is the additional releasing
part to the trachea after bilateral hyoid bone cutting.
Then, tracheal anastomosis was done with 03 vicryle
suture and finally chin to chest stitch was performed. We
didn’t use further releasing maneuver such as hilar release.
All patients were transferred to ICU.
Results
This study was accomplished in 20 patients. (Table 1
shows patients’ characteristics). Prolonged intubation
due to head injuries was the etiology of tracheal stenosis
in all patients. All patients were discharged from ICU
with tracheostomy tube (Due to cerebral complications
and impairment of consciousness, all the patients under￾went tracheostomy) and returned to continue the treat￾ment afterwards. In term of preoperatine function of the
patients while all of them had tracheostomy and were
unable to breathe without it (group 4). Patients under￾went neck CT scan with reconstruction in order to
evaluate the length of the trachea and stenosis. More￾over, they underwent rigid bronchoscopy prior to treat￾ment. The mean length of the released segment after
bilateral hyoid bone cutting was 1.1 ± 0.4 cm. Resection
and anastomosis techniques were done in 16 patients,

and due to anterior hyoid bone involvement, posterior tra￾cheal membranous flap technique was performed in other
4 patients.18 patients were extubated and transferred to
the ICU, 2 patients were transferred extubated to ICU and
tracheostomy was done 3 days afterwards, but was
converted to T. Tube due to tracheomalacia 10 days after
surgery. Early post operation complications were seen
only in 4 patients: two patients with wound infection
(10%) and two other patients due to tracheomalacia and
collapse of anastomosis area (10%). Patients needed
tracheostomy distal to anastomosis suture line and were
transferred to ICU. In these patients, removal of the
tracheostomy couldn’t be done, so we had to convert
tracheostomy to T. Tube. We hadn’t laryngeal dysfunction
and hoarseness secondary to recurrent laryngeal nerve in￾jury. Late post operation complication was stenosis that
occurred in 5 patients (25%): four of them underwent tra￾cheal dilatation (20%) and one patient underwent multiple
tracheal dilation plus T. Tube insertion as a result of post
dilatation stenosis recurrence (5%). The characteristics of
patients show Table 1.
We didn’t have any mortality. Post operative follow up
in 3 patients with T. Tube was done. T. Tube was
removed in 2 patients 14 and 18 months after surgery,
but the third patient had T. Tube in place (5%). Con￾sidering patient’s quality of life three years after treat￾ment, following results were noted as: [1] Excellent
group including 2 patients (10%) [2] Good group includ￾ing 14 patients (70%) [3] Moderate group including 3
patients (15%) [4] Poor group including 1 patient (we
could not extract the T. Tube after treatment in this
group). 17 patients had normal swallowing function after
the surgery (85%) and 3 (15%) patients had liquid dys￾phasia from whom 2 patients recovered 9 months after
the surgery and the other patient showed no signs
ofrecovery. Table 2 show Considering statistical analysis,
factors affecting early and late post operative complications.
Discussion
The blood supply of extrathoracic trachea is from 3 nu￾tritive branches of inferior thyroid artery therefore, tra￾cheal ischemia leads to inflammation, granulation and
eventually tracheal transmural stenosis [2]. One of the
most common reasons of this complication is using
high-pressure cuffed endotracheal tube or tracheostomy
tube, which leads to increment of pressure in the area,
as well as ischemia and tracheal stenosis in prolonged
usage. The high incidence of tracheal stenosis in the site
near the tip of the intubations tube and the site of
tracheostomy, other than the endotracheal tube cuff
area, results in long and multisegmental tracheal stenosis
in patients who underwent prolonged mechanical ven￾tilation [2]. Stridor is one of the prevalent signs in
patients with tracheal stenosis, especially in those with
the history of intubations in their past medical history.
Some studies mentioned that even 24 hours of intuba￾tion is enough for this complication to occur. It should
be noted that in some cases patients may be intubated
long time ago and they would not remember the occa￾sion. On the other hand, some studies showed that
patients can become symptomatic even one year after
inubation [4,5]. Patients with stridor and the history of
prolonged intubation should undergo general anesthesia
before making any therapeutic decisions. Consequently,
no additional tracheal injuries will occur due to urgent
tracheostoma in an inappropriate setting [6]. In this
study, all patients underwent temporary tracheostomy in
other words, and after referring to our ward, they under￾went general anesthesia and were evaluated by rigid
bronchoscopy. Therefore, the expansion of the stenosis
and the anatomy of trachea were precisely assessed. The
treatment of post-intubation tracheal stenosis has been a
therapeutic challenge for years. Various techniques have
been discussed as different treatments including repea￾ted dilatation, laser therapy, cryosurgery and surgery.
The first three aforementioned techniques have some
problems like high failure and the need for repeating the
procedure; therefore, surgery is the treatment of choice
in post-intubations tracheal stenosis [7]. The resection
of long and multi segmental tracheal stenosis is one of

the therapeutic difficulties which mostly affects the pri￾mary reconstruction of these patients. Grillo et al. (1995)
studied 503 patients with tracheal stenosis who underwent
521 surgeries (tracheal or laryngotracheal surgeries). The
result of treatment in 93.7% of patients was divided into 2
groups of good and excellent, so they mentioned that the
preferable treatment is surgical resection and reconstruc￾tion of affected segment [2]. In 2007, Babarro and col￾leagues performed a study on the long tracheal resections.
They pointed out that surgical treatment is the method of
choice in these cases. They also claimed that the T. Tube
was inserted in patients with long resection at the end of
the surgery. Besides, they mentioned that the suprahyoid
muscle releasing maneuver and bilateral hyoid bone cut￾ting are useful to prevent the traction in resection of proxi￾mal stenosis [8]. A study by Marulli et al. (2006) reported
that one time resection and primary reconstruction can be
done for long stenosis with laryngeal involvement in be￾nign stenosis, having a good long time result (approxi￾mately 93.3% for the 2 groups of good and excellent) [7].
In addition, a study by Wynn R and colleagues (2004)
revealed that the results of surgery and primary recon￾struction in the treatment of tracheal stenosis have high
success rate [9]. In a study on the resection techniques of
proximal long segment tracheal stenosis (more than 40%
of tracheal length), Soon et al. emphasized on the releasing
maneuvers especially suprahyoid muscle releasing ma￾neuver and bilateral hyoid bone cutting. They also
mentioned that hyoid bone cutting in limited resections
was not necessary [3]. Tracheal surgery has early and late
complications. Some of the early complications are as
follows: dehiscence of anastomosis resulting from exces￾sive traction in suturing site, wound infection, respiratory
tract edema. The most prevalent late complication is tra￾cheal stenosis recurrence due to granulation tissue forma￾tion. As a matter of fact, dehiscence of anastomosis is the
most dreaded, and late granulation tissue formation and
wound infection are the most prevalent complications [2].
The important point was that the dehiscence of anasto￾mosis site resulting from tension in suture line occurred
because of performing the tracheal releasing techniques.
Based on the fact that one of the complications in tra￾cheal surgery is post operative granulation tissue forma￾tion which is a result of the proportional traction in the
anastomosis site, choosing the appropriate suture string
is important. Therefore, the sutural knot should be
formed extratracheally to prevent the granulation tis￾sue formation. In a study by Behrend et al., 3 types of
absorbable suture strings (poly propylene, polydio,
polyglactin) were used in tracheal surgery. They revealed
that the results were similar in all 3 groups, but also
mentioned that the sutural string should be with high
tension ability and shouldn’t be absorbed in less than
6 months. They also mentioned that techniqual matters
especially tension are more effective than choosing the
suture string in post operative results [10]. Nowadays
endoscopic treatment of post-intubation benign stenosis
has its own adherents. Gulluccio et al. (2009) reported
that repeated dilatation, stenting or laser therapy have a
role in treatment of simple and short segment post in￾tubation tracheal stenosis, but surgery is the method of
choice in long and multi segmental tracheal stenosis
[11]. Moreover, in a study by Nouraei SA et al. (2007)
endoscopic treatments were assessed as effective pro￾cedures in post-tracheostomy limited stenosis. They
claimed that surgery is the method of choice in long and
multi segment tracheal stenosis [12]. Cavaliere S et al.
(2007) also pointed out that endoscopic treatments can be
used in some specific patients as a supplementary proce￾dure besides surgery, or as a particular method in post ope￾rative stenosis [13]. In this study endoscopic treatments
(repeated dilatation) were performed in post operative
stenosis recurrence as a supplementary procedure, but not
as the first line treatment. Because of long segment sten￾osis, surgery was the first choice of treatment in these
patients. One of the other therapeutic methods in post
operative recurrent stenosis is applying polyflex stents.
A study by Bagheri et al. (2004) revealed that the usage
of polyflex stent is inappropriate due to the complications
that occurred after a few months. Therefore, the stent
should be removed, which can lead to granulation tissue
formation and dramatic stenosis.
Eventually they recommended T. Tube insertion in an
inoperable complex stenosis [14].
Conclusion
Considering high prevalence of post-intubation tracheal
stenosis, especially the long segment types, good thera￾peutic results can be achieved by performing a multi dis￾ciplinary strategy (surgery, endoscopic treatment and
combined treatment). Despite few numbers of patients
in this study and the need for further clinical studies for
definitive conclusion based on our results.
