Mathematical modeling is a powerful tool to investigate hemodynamics of the circulatory
system. With improving imaging techniques and detailed clinical investigations, it is now
possible to construct patient-specific models of reconstructive surgeries for the treatment
of congenital heart diseases. These models can help clinicians to better understand the
hemodynamic behavior of different surgical options for a treated patient. This review
outlines recent advances in mathematical modeling in congenital heart diseases, the
discoveries and limitations these models present, and future directions that are on the
horizon.
Keywords: mathematical model, fluid dynamics, patient-specific, medical images
INTRODUCTION
Treatment of congenital heart diseases (CHD) has evolved rapidly
in recent years, requiring customized therapies due to the large
inter-patient variability of anatomical and hemodynamic param￾eters within the vascular arrangement following a surgical repair.
Virtual surgery based on computational fluid dynamics or in sil￾ico patient-specific modeling is a promising tool because it could
help surgeons in the decision-making process, improving and
understanding hemodynamic outcomes and reducing trial errors
during complex surgeries (1–4).
The major areas of research for mathematical modeling of
CHD are univentricular circulation and aortic and pulmonary
malformations. The former is the focus of this article, while a
detailed review on aortic coarctation has been provided recently
by LaDisa et al. (5).
UNIVENTRICULAR CIRCULATION MODELING
Palliations developed to treat single ventricle heart defects aim
to by-pass the non-functional ventricle and establish a direct
connection between the systemic venous and pulmonary arterial
circulations (6). These treatments usually include three consec￾utive stages: (i) Norwood procedure [Blalock–Taussig shunts,
central shunts, right ventricle-to-pulmonary artery conduit and
the hybrid Norwood (7)], (ii) Glenn or hemi-Fontan proce￾dures, and (iii) the complete Fontan procedure (or total cavo￾pulmonary connection). The peculiar geometries resulting from
these surgical procedures are associated with different fluid
dynamics that may affect the univentricular circulation with
different energy losses and uneven blood distribution to the
lungs.
The up-to-date modeling approach to study these surgeries is
based on different steps summarized in Figure 1, where a total
cavo-pulmonary connection is shown as an example. First, the
clinical images, generally from magnetic resonance (MR) or com￾puted tomography (CT), are piled-up and used to extract the
vessel contours. Secondly the generated curves are connected to
create a three-dimensional (3D) geometry that can be eventually
smoothed. The resulting geometry is then divided in small ele￾ments or volumes. This process is called mesh discretization. In
the vertexes or centers of the elements or volumes, the govern￾ing fluid dynamics equations (i.e., Navier-Stokes equations) are
solved, imposing proper boundary conditions and allowing the
visualization of velocities, pressures fields, and the quantities that
can be derived from them, e.g., the wall shear stresses. For a more
detailed description on how these models work and can be con￾structed we refer the reader to the works by Vignon-Clementel
et al. (8) and Corsini et al. (4).
From a modeling point of view the study of fluid dynamics
in systemic-to-pulmonary shunts is a more complex and chal￾lenging issue than that related to the later surgical stages, where
the flows are less pulsatile and pressure fields are more uniform.
In fact, fluid dynamics in stage one has rarely been investigated
and modeling works represent a minority among all those related
to surgical repairs for treating CHD. One reason is that the
shunt and surrounding geometry after the operation varies a lot
among individuals, and the shunt flow, typically the only source

Pennati et al. Computational fluid dynamics models of CHD
FIGURE 1 | Steps required to build a patient-specific model of
cavo-pulmonary connection. (1) Acquisition of clinical images (from
magnetic resonance); (2) extraction of vessel contours; (3) generation of 3D
vessel surface and volume; (4) discretization of the geometry in small
elements or volumes; (5) prescription of boundary conditions (in this case the
superior and inferior venae cavae flows—QSVC and QIVC—and atrial pressure);
(6) simulation and visualization of results (in this case particle paths, colored
by velocity, injected from superior and inferior venae cavae).
of pulmonary flow, is pulsatile with significant pressure gradients
and velocities. An accurate mathematical description or numer￾ical simulation of the local fluid dynamics of the shunt is thus
necessary in modeling the Norwood circulation as the shunt flow
is driven by the pressure difference between the systemic and pul￾monary arterial circulations, and is regulated by the geometrical
shunt features. Nevertheless, any hemodynamic analysis cannot
be localized on the shunt region alone, since the whole circulation
has to be accounted for in order to ensure proper coronary per￾fusion, minimize ventricular volume overload, and pulmonary
hypertension. Furthermore, in infants and small babies, mathe￾matically accurate measurements and data needed for modeling
purposes are difficult to obtain. Most studies have been limited
to either 3D computational models (9–14) or in vitro models
(15–19) of the local fluid dynamics. Such models, although pro￾viding a very detailed description of the local hemodynamics,
could not describe the mutual interactions with the remainder
of the circulatory system, because boundary conditions (flows or
pressures) were enforced to the model.
A first attempt to remove this limitation was made by
Migliavacca and colleagues (20), who built a detailed closed-loop
lumped parameter, i.e., zero-dimensional, model (LPM or 0D)
accounting for the entire circulation of the patient. In particular,
the complex hydraulic behavior of the shunt was modeled as a
non-linear resistance varying with the shunt diameter and flow
rate, whose parameter values had been previously deduced from
simulations with 3D local models. Although simulation results
matched clinical observations reasonably well, the lack of clinical
data (except for the whole systemic and pulmonary vascular resis￾tances) measured in peripheral regions of the circulation made
parameter identification a difficult task.
Later on, in order to utilize the information obtained from
both 3D models (i.e., local fluid dynamic variables and effect
of changing anatomical features) and LPMs (i.e., pressures and
flow distribution throughout the peripheral circulation) at the
same time, a combined approach coupling the two types of
models has been developed. A computational application of this
methodology can be found in Laganà et al. (21), Migliavacca
et al. (22), Bove et al. (23), Baretta et al. (24) and Corsini
et al. (25), where the hemodynamic effects of a central shunt, a
modified Blalock–Taussig shunt, a right ventricle-to-pulmonary
artery shunt and the hybrid approach were analyzed in terms

of pulmonary and coronary perfusion, as well as ventricular
performance.
Despite the advantages brought by the combined methodol￾ogy into the study of surgical procedures whose hemodynamic
outcomes are still hard to predict from a clinical point of view,
and given that a complete customization of the cardiovascular
system is not achievable, modeling of shunts so far is limited to
designs, whether 3D or 0D, which refer to clinical data averaged
over groups of patients. This could be partly solved using MR
scans and hemodynamic data from Doppler, MR or catheteriza￾tion exams performed on a specific patient in preparation for the
next surgical stage, i.e., Glenn procedure (26).
Contrary to the Norwood circulation, a number of in vitro and
in silico studies evaluated the local and global fluid dynamics fol￾lowing the surgical creation of cavo-pulmonary anastomoses, in
order to find the design that minimizes energy dissipations and
optimizes the flow balance between the right and left pulmonary
arteries (RPA and LPA). A review of the literature related to this
topic is reported in DeGroff (27). Earlier studies reconstructed
simplified geometries, representing typical anatomies of patients
with cavo-pulmonary connections (28–33). More recently, the
use of tomographic medical imaging techniques, such as MR
and CT, has joined the well-established ultrasound and angiog￾raphy imaging techniques and has allowed more realistic 3D
reconstructions of a specific patient’s vessels (34–39).
However, the sole geometrical accuracy does not guaran￾tee realistic haemodynamic results. Indeed, boundary conditions
required by in silico models may play a major role in determining
energy dissipations and controlling flow distribution among the
pulmonary branches (33, 37, 40–42).
In several in silico and in vitro studies, either volume flow
rates or velocity profiles were prescribed as inlet boundary condi￾tions together with a fixed pressure at the pulmonary outlets. As
an alternative, flows were employed to set proper outlet bound￾ary conditions (i.e., flow ratio to lungs) as well. This allows
the user to define, apply or calculate different lung resistances
of the model, not necessarily assuming that the right and left
pulmonary vascular resistances (PVRs) are identical. In most of
the recent published works, inlet and outlet flow values were
assumed on the basis of averaged or time dependent clinical
measurements. For example, use of MR phase contrast veloc￾ity mapping provides volume flow rates for the vessels supplying
(SVC and, in case, IVC) and draining (LPA and RPA) the region
of the cavo-pulmonary connection, thus allowing the simula￾tion of patient-specific hemodynamics and power loss calculation
(36, 43, 44).
In patient-specific modeling of cavo-pulmonary connections,
the prescription of realistic outlet boundary conditions is nec￾essary since they determine blood flow split into the RPA and
LPA. PVR can be clinically evaluated through a catheterization
exam where atrial and pulmonary arterial pressures are mea￾sured, but measurements of the individual pulmonary arterial
branches (RPA and LPA) are usually absent due to the poor res￾olution of pressure sensors and the uncertainty of catheter tip
location. Therefore, if left and right pulmonary blood flows are
not available from MR data, a common assumption is to adopt
equal values for left and right PVRs (29, 45, 46).
More appropriate patient-specific impedance values can be
deduced on the basis of numerical simulations taking into
account both pressure and flow collected data. Marsden et al.
(37) used a coupled multidomain method (47) to apply resistance
boundary conditions at the pulmonary outlets of 3D models of
cavo-pulmonary connections reconstructed by means of MR and
CT images. However, a number of important assumptions were
done due to lack of clinical measurements: (i) left-right lung
flow split was assumed; (ii) pulmonary resistances were chosen
to obtain a pressure level in the SVC in agreement with car￾diac catheterization data; (iii) left and right resistance values were
assumed to be either inversely proportional to the outlet areas of
the model or different fractions of the left/right pulmonary flows
imposed to the pulmonary lobes.
An interesting approach for tackling the problem of outlet
boundary conditions in pulmonary stenotic models was proposed
by Spilker and colleagues (40) who coupled a patient-specific 3D
finite element model of the proximal pulmonary arteries, with
a one-dimensional linearized morphometric representation of
the distal lung vasculature with diameters down to 20µm, i.e.,
slightly larger than capillaries. Recently, Spilker and Taylor (42)
have developed an automatic and effective method to systemat￾ically tune the LPMs used as outlet boundary conditions of 3D
blood flow models (i.e., an idealized common carotid artery, an
idealized iliac arterial bifurcation, and a patient-specific abdom￾inal aorta) in order to achieve the desired features of pressure
and flow waveforms. Hence, the most recent strategy suggested
the use of patient-specific values not only to impose the inlet
flow, but also to derive the downstream impedances coupled to
patient-specific 3D anatomic models.
However, if future scenarios such as after a surgical geometry
modification (35, 48) or exercise conditions (37) are simulated,
actual flow rates are not available. Although usually adopted,
pre-operative blood flows might be very different from those
occurring in new scenarios, thus preventing an accurate vir￾tual planning of the cardiovascular surgical repairs. Once again,
combined modeling approaches which couple a 3D model of
the surgical region with a LPM (22, 42, 44, 49–52) or a one￾dimensional model (40) of the remainder of the cardiovascular
system may solve the issue of defining reasonable boundary
conditions, provided that a closed-loop coupling is performed.
The predictive role of the virtual surgery in helping sur￾geons choose the most effective customized procedure might
be useful for the treatment of CHD, though it implies several
challenges (44), and requires a considerable, interactive work
among surgeons, physicians and engineers. The main limitations
affecting computational modeling of CHD are: the MR imag￾ing resolution, the wall rigidity assumption, and the absence of
implementation in the LPM of short-term feed-back mechanisms
(e.g., the influence of coronary perfusion on cardiac contractility)
and long-term adaptive phenomena (e.g., physiologic/pathologic
changes due to vessel remodeling and patient growth). Even
with the state-of-the-art imaging techniques, the first limita￾tion still impedes an accurate 3D modeling of small vessels or
conduits such as the systemic-to-pulmonary shunts. The second
point should be considered especially for the first stage pallia￾tion, since previous experimental (18) and computational (11)
www.frontiersin.org February 2013 | Volume 1 | Article 4 | 3

Pennati et al. Computational fluid dynamics models of CHD
studies suggested that the shape and area of the distal anastomo￾sis of the shunt significantly changes with the pulmonary artery
pressure, thus with the PVR. Therefore, shunts with different
diameters do not necessarily behave in different ways, depending
on their downstream resistance. However, simulating compliant
vessels with complex geometry and steeply changing wall prop￾erties (from systemic artery to Gore-Tex, to pulmonary artery)
is not trivial and would require a noticeable computational
effort. To overcome the last limitation implies deep knowledge of
the patho-physiologic mechanisms causing the aforementioned
phenomena, but enough relevant clinical data allowing realistic
modeling are still not available.
Finally, a brief note should be devoted to the fluid dynamics
generated by mechanical devices. In this context, blood pump
specifically designed to support adolescent and adult patients
with single ventricle physiology has been recently studied with
the aim of providing a therapeutic option to medically stabilize
patients. Rodefeld et al. (53) presented a 3D idealized com￾putational model of the total cavo-pulmonary connection with
an impeller represented as a smooth two-sided conical actuator
disk with rotation in the vena caval axis. The authors demon￾strated a reduction in power loss by 88%. More recently the same
authors (54) investigated the hemodynamic and hemolysis per￾formance of a catheter-based viscous impeller pump to power the
Fontan circulation either with computer simulations and a mock
circuit.
AORTIC AND PULMONARY MALFORMATIONS
Mathematical modeling has also been applied with success to the
studies of aortic and pulmonary malformations.
Stand-alone lumped parameters models have demonstrated a
good performance in the study of pulmonary regurgitation after
repair of tetralogy of Fallot (55). The authors demonstrated that
amount of regurgitation, in the absence of an effective valve,
FIGURE 2 | Cardiovascular magnetic resonance studies in a patient

patient (upper panels) was a 20 year old man, born with tetralogy of Fallot,
palliated with a right Blalock–Taussig shunt and repaired at 8 years with a

Pennati et al. Computational fluid dynamics models of CHD
depends on pulmonary arterial compliance and on the location
of resistance relative to the compliance (Figure 2).
LaDisa et al. (5) reviewed the recent modeling literature on
aortic coarctation similarly to what applied in the univentricular
circulation. The results from the analysed studies provided a
greater understanding of the preoperative and postoperative
assessment of surgical and interventional options and an addi￾tional tool for prediction of postoperative quantities. Aortic walls
are compliant and the interaction between the fluid and solid
parts is more important than in the venous districts. For these rea￾sons the most recent studies (56) included also a fluid-structure
interaction (FSI) modeling.
CONCLUSIONS
In mathematical modeling of surgical corrections for univentric￾ular hearts, pulmonary and aortic malformations, several goals
have been achieved so far, namely:
• Availability of patient-specific imaging data to allow the recon￾struction of customized 3D models;
• flow, velocity and pressure data acquired from the investigated
patient (with MR, Doppler and catheterization exams) are used
to define patient-specific boundary conditions;
• connecting a LPM to a geometrical model in a closed￾loop fashion enables mutual interaction between the local
(more detailed) and global descriptions of the investigated
fluid dynamics, thus avoiding unrealistic assumptions on the
upstream and downstream circulations;
• the modeling software currently available allows to perform
various virtual surgeries on the studied anatomic models, sim￾ulating the final result of the surgical operation; such models
can be used further to evaluate which is the best model in terms
of hemodynamic performance;
• with the current computing power availability in computa￾tional laboratories, simulations tasks that used to require days
to complete can now be solved in hours.
In the future, however, some aspects of the modeling process need
to be refined:
• Both imaging (e.g., from MR) resolution and geometrical
refining algorithms currently used are expected to improve,
in order to reconstruct more faithfully customized complex
anatomies and tiny vessels;
• virtual surgical planning needs to emphasize the importance of
pre-operatively collecting as many congruent patient-specific
data as possible, to predict more accurately the patient-specific
hemodynamics in the new configurations;
• relevant clinical data should be collected also to explore the
causes of short-term and long-term adaptive phenomena, with
the final objective of their realistic implementation within the
models;
• for application in a clinical environment computing power
should further increase to allow simulation times to be in the
order of minutes.
Information obtained from numerical models cannot substi￾tute clinical exams and judgment, but can provide insights
to guide clinical decisions. Furthermore, allowing predictions
and interpretations of phenomena and mechanisms that are
not well-defined, mathematical models can resolve complex,
altered cardiovascular physiology, as well as evaluate clini￾cally relevant parameters which are not routinely measured.
The added value resulting from computational modeling has
already been exploited in the clinical management of coro￾nary artery disease in adults (57). This could be potentially
applied to CHD, provided that proper accuracy and resolution
are obtained with advancements in the measurement and imaging
techniques.
