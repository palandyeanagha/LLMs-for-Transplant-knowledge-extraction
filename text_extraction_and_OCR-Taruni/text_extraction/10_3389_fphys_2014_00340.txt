Introduction: Acute kidney injury (AKI) and intestinal injury negatively impact patient
outcome after cardiac surgery. Enhanced nitric oxide (NO) consumption due to
intraoperative intravascular hemolysis, may play an important role in this setting.
This study investigated the impact of hemolysis on plasma NO consumption, AKI, and
intestinal tissue damage, after cardiac surgery.
Methods: Hemolysis (by plasma extracellular (free) hemoglobin; fHb), plasma
NO-consumption, plasma fHb-binding capacity by haptoglobin (Hp), renal tubular injury
(using urinary N-Acetyl-β-D-glucosaminidase; NAG), intestinal mucosal injury (through
plasma intestinal fatty acid binding protein; IFABP), and AKI were studied in patients
undergoing off-pump cardiac surgery (OPCAB, N = 7), on-pump coronary artery bypass
grafting (CABG, N = 30), or combined CABG and valve surgery (CABG+Valve, N = 30).
Results: FHb plasma levels and NO-consumption significantly increased, while
plasma Hp concentrations significantly decreased in CABG and CABG+Valve patients
(p < 0.0001) during surgery. The extent of hemolysis and NO-consumption correlated
significantly (r2 = 0.75, p < 0.0001). Also, NAG and IFABP increased in both groups
(p < 0.0001, and p < 0.001, respectively), and both were significantly associated
with hemolysis (Rs = 0.70, p < 0.0001, and Rs = 0.26, p = 0.04, respectively) and
NO-consumption (Rs = 0.55, p = 0.002, and Rs = 0.41, p = 0.03, respectively), also
after multivariable logistic regression analysis. OPCAB patients did not show increased
fHb, NO-consumption, NAG, or IFABP levels. Patients suffering from AKI (N = 9, 13.4%)
displayed significantly higher fHb and NAG levels already during surgery compared to
non-AKI patients.
Conclusions: Hemolysis appears to be an important contributor to postoperative kidney
injury and intestinal mucosal damage, potentially by limiting NO-bioavailability. This
observation offers a novel diagnostic and therapeutic target to improve patient outcome
after cardiothoracic surgery.

INTRODUCTION
Visceral complications significantly contribute to increased
morbidity and mortality after cardiac surgery, and lengthen dura￾tion of stay at the intensive care unit (ICU) and total hospital￾ization time. More specifically, loss of intestinal wall integrity,
for instance due to intestinal ischemia, promotes bacterial
translocation, and may induce a systemic inflammatory response
(SIRS) or sepsis (Grotz et al., 1999; Huybregts et al., 2007). Acute
kidney injury (AKI) is also common (5–30%) (Conlon et al.,
1999; Lassnigg et al., 2004) and associated with high morbidity
and mortality, particularly when patients require dialysis (Rosner
and Okusa, 2006).

Vermeulen Windsant et al. Hemolysis and postoperative organ injury
The identification of potentially modifiable risk factors for
the development of visceral injury during cardiac surgery is
imperative for the development of specific treatment strate￾gies to improve patient outcome. The use of cardiopulmonary
bypass (CPB) significantly contributes to the development of
intestinal mucosal injury and renal tubular damage through
induction of (microcirculatory) blood flow alterations, ischemia￾reperfusion injury, hemodilution, and a pro-inflammatory
response (Kameneva et al., 1999; Loef et al., 2002; Schrier et al.,
2004). Another common consequence of CPB use is the devel￾opment of intravascular hemolysis characterized by an acute rise
of circulatory cell free hemoglobin (fHb) (Vercaemst, 2008). The
discovery of the potent nitric oxide (NO) scavenging property
of fHb has been associated with decreased microcirculatory NO￾bioavailability, decreased organ perfusion and renal function, and
increased mortality during exacerbations of diseases character￾ized by chronic hemolysis (Reiter et al., 2002; Rother et al., 2005).
Recently, we have shown that also transient increases in plasma
fHb concentrations are independently associated with proximal
renal tubular injury and postoperative AKI after CPB-assisted
thoracoabdominal aortic surgery (Vermeulen Windsant et al.,
2010).
In the present study we tested the hypothesis that hemoly￾sis during cardiac surgery is (1) principally a consequence of
CPB, (2) leads to increased intravascular consumption of NO
(reflecting decreased NO-bioavailability, Reiter et al., 2002), and
(3) contributes to the development of visceral tissue damage
and postoperative renal dysfunction. In order to investigate the
impact of CPB on the development of intraoperative hemoly￾sis, we studied changes of fHb, haptoglobin (Hp, the physio￾logic intravascular fHb scavenger), plasma NO-consumption, and
markers of renal tubular damage and intestinal mucosal injury
in three groups of patients undergoing cardiac surgery associ￾ated with increasing perfusion times: off-pump coronary artery
bypass grafting CABG (OPCAB), CABG with CPB, and com￾bined CABG and valve surgery with CPB (CABG+Valve). Also,
the incidence of clinical acute kidney injury was evaluated using
the AKIN-criteria (Mehta et al., 2007).
SUBJECTS AND METHODS
PATIENTS
Based on a pilot study, power analysis indicated that inclusion
of 30 patients per study group enabled detection of statistical
significant differences in fHb levels. As we hypothesized that
the duration of cardiopulmonary bypass time influences the
extent of hemolysis, we included 30 consecutive adult patients
undergoing elective on-pump CABG surgery and 30 consecutive
patients undergoing elective CABG+Valve surgery (reconstruc￾tion and/or replacement of any valve), meeting the inclusion
and exclusion criteria. Patients undergoing OPCAB surgery
were included to serve as a control group as we expected that
hemolysis does not develop in this patient group. However, as
OPCAB surgery is infrequently performed at our institution,
we included all OPCAB patients meeting the inclusion and
exclusion criteria during the inclusion period of the CABG and
CABG+Valve patients. This resulted in the final inclusion of 7
OPCAB patients. In total, sixty-seven adult patients undergoing
elective cardiac surgery at the Department of Cardiothoracic
Surgery of the Maastricht University Medical Center+ between
November 2009 and January 2011 were studied. The study
was approved by the Institutional Review Board and written
informed consent was obtained from every patient prior to
surgery. A preoperative estimated glomerular filtration rate
(eGFR) < 60 ml/min/1.73 m2, indicating chronic kidney disease
(CKD) according to the KDOQI guidelines (National Kidney
Foundation, 2002) in the absence of information regarding
structural and/or functional renal abnormalities, was reason for
exclusion as these patients are at increased risk for postoperative
AKI, irrespective of other (potential) risk factors. In addition,
presence of diabetes was reason for exclusion as these patients
display higher baseline levels of N-Acetyl-β-D-glucosaminidase
(NAG), one of the studied markers. In addition, presence of
chronic hemolytic disease was reason for patient exclusion. The
cardiac surgery protocol as performed at our institution has been
described in more detail elsewhere (Heijmans et al., 2007).
STUDY ENDPOINTS
The primary study endpoint was to investigate whether hemol￾ysis, reflected by plasma fHb concentrations, causes a signifi￾cant increase in intravascular NO-consumption during cardiac
surgery, thus impairing NO-bioavailability. Second, we evaluated
the extent of visceral tissue injury which develops during OPCAB
surgery, CABG surgery and CABG+Valve surgery. In addition,
the correlation between hemolysis, increased NO-consumption,
visceral tissue damage (indicated by increased urinary and plasma
levels of renal and intestinal damage), and postoperative AKI was
investigated. Lastly, we investigated changes plasma haptoglobin
levels, an important fHb binding protein involved in clearance of
fHb.
DEFINITION OF POSTOPERATIVE ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY
Postoperative AKI was defined according to the AKI Network
(AKIN) classification (Mehta et al., 2007). This classification for
AKI uses either changes in serum creatinine or urine output
from a preset baseline (in our case, preoperative level). As we
did not have sufficient reliable data on urine output we used
the serum creatinine criteria. Patients were stratified according
to three grades of postoperative AKI of increasing severity. Stage
1 AKI was defined as an increase in serum creatinine of more
than or equal to 0.3 mg/dl (≥26.4μmol/l) or increase to more
than or equal to 150–200% (1.5- to 2-fold) from the preoperative
level. Stage 2 AKI was defined as an increase in serum creatinine
to more than 200–300% (>2- to 3-fold) from the preoperative
level. Stage 3 AKI was defined as an increase in serum crea￾tinine to more than 300% (>3-fold) from baseline (or serum
creatinine of more than or equal to 4.0 mg/dl [≥354μmol/l]
with an acute increase of at least 0.5 mg/dl [44μmol/l]).
Patients requiring (transient) postoperative renal replacement
therapy were classified as Stage 3, irrespective of creatinine
change.
BLOOD SAMPLING, URINE SAMPLING, AND SAMPLE PROCESSING
Arterial blood and a fresh spot urine sample were obtained at 8
pre-set perioperative time points; 1, preoperatively, after induc￾tion but prior to sternotomy; 2, before start of CPB; 3, end CPB;
Frontiers in Physiology | Oxidant Physiology September 2014 | Volume 5 | Article 340 | 2

4, 15 min after cessation of CPB; 5, 2 h after cessation of CPB;
6, 4 h after cessation of CPB; 7, day 1 postoperatively; 8, day 2
postoperatively. Whole blood was collected in EDTA vacutainers
(Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ). All samples were imme￾diately put on ice and centrifuged within 15 min after collection
(1500 g at 4◦C for 15 min without brake), aliquoted, and stored
at −80◦C until further analysis.
ANALYSIS OF HEMOLYSIS, HAPTOGLOBIN, RENAL TUBULAR DAMAGE,
AND INTESTINAL DAMAGE
Plasma fHb concentrations were measured by derivative spec￾trometry as previously described (Cruz-Landeira et al., 2002).
The lower detection limit of the assay was 2 μM. The course of
plasma Hp, the physiological fHb-scavenger (Kristiansen et al.,
2001), during surgery was measured on a validated Beckman
LX20 clinical chemistry analyzer (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA)
via a turbidimetric method by the Central Diagnostic Laboratory
of the Maastricht University Medical Center. To assess renal
tubular damage, urinary NAG concentrations were determined
by an enzyme colorimetric assay according to the manufac￾turer’s instructions (HaemoScan, Groningen, The Netherlands)
(Dittrich et al., 2000). Results were normalized to urinary cre￾atinine to correct for dilution and expressed as U/mmol cre￾atinine. Intestinal mucosal damage was studied using plasma
concentrations of intestinal fatty acid binding protein (IFABP)
which were assessed by an in-house human IFABP ELISA with
a detection limit of 12.5 pg/mL. IFABP is an early, sensitive, and
specific marker of clinically relevant intestinal mucosal damage.
Furthermore, we recently demonstrated excellent discriminating
value of plasma IFABP levels for the detection of clinically signif￾icant intestinal ischemia in patients undergoing open abdominal
or thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repair (Lieberman et al.,
1997; Vermeulen Windsant et al., 2012a). As the extent of hemod￾ilution during surgery differed between the three study groups,
impairing optimal comparison of the studied plasma proteins
fHb, Hp, and IFABP, we corrected these values for plasma hemat￾ocrit at the moment of blood sampling.
NO CONSUMPTION ASSAY
To evaluate the NO-consuming capacity of plasma by fHb, we
randomly selected 29 patients (5 OPCAB, 12 CABG, and 12
CABG+Valve patients) using SPSS. The complete NO consump￾tion protocol is described elsewhere (Reiter et al., 2002; Rother
et al., 2005). Briefly, a 40μM solution of the NO-donor, DETA
NONOate (Cayman Chemical, Ann Harbor, MI) was prepared
in PBS (pH 7.4) in a glass vessel purged with nitrogen in-line
with a NO chemiluminescence analyzer (Sievers Model 280i, GE,
Boulder, CO). The subsequent decay of DETA NONOate, releas￾ing NO, produced a steady state NO signal of about 50–70 mV.
When the signal became stable, 50μL of plasma was injected into
the DETA NONOate solution, decreasing the NO signal in case of
NO-consumption. Data were analyzed with the software program
ORIGIN Version 6.1 (OriginLab, Northampton, MA) for analysis
of the area under the curve (AUC) of decreasing NO-signal over
time. The amount of NO consumption by plasma was quanti￾fied by comparison of the AUC with that of NO gas standards
(produced from injections of nitrite into triiodide).
STATISTICS
Continuous data are presented as median and interquartile
range (IQR, 25–75th percentile) or mean ± s.e.m., depend￾ing on Gaussian distribution (checked using histograms and
normal Q-Q plots). Dichotomous data are depicted as %
(N). Differences between study groups were compared using
Pearson Chi-square test with Fisher’s correction when appro￾priate (dichotomous variables), or independent sample T￾test or Kruskal-Wallis test (for continuous variables). Overall
changes in fHb, NO-consumption, Hp, NAG, and IFABP
levels within groups were tested using the Friedman test
for repeated data. If this test yielded a significant result, a
Wilcoxon signed ranks test with Bonferroni’s correction was
used for the post-hoc analysis. To characterize total release
of fHb, plasma NO- consumption, urinary NAG, and plasma
IFABP, the area under the curve (AUCfHb, AUCNO, AUCNAG,
and AUCIFABP) was calculated for each patient using trape￾zoidal analysis with time as a baseline. Univariate correla￾tions were Spearman correlations (Rs) and linear regression
analysis (r2). Multivariable linear regression analysis (“enter
method”) enabled correction for other confounding risk factors.
Confounding variables known to be associated with increased
NAG concentrations and IFABP concentrations were chosen.
Statistical calculations were made using SPSS 15.0 (SPSS, Inc.,
Chicago, IL), and Prism 4.03 (GraphPad Software Inc. San
Diego, CA). Values of p < 0.05 were considered to be statistically
significant.
RESULTS
PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS AND OUTCOME
Patients were predominantly male (N = 57, 85.1%) and middle￾aged (mean 66.5 years, range 38–82 years). Baseline demographic
patient data did not significantly differ among patients under￾going OPCAB, CABG, or CABG+Valve surgery (Supplementary
Table 1). Preoperative renal function was significantly lower in the
latter two patient groups (p = 0.003). In total, 9 patients devel￾oped AKI (13.4%) of whom 8 patients developed stage 1 AKI,
and 1 patient stage 2 AKI. Renal function recovered in all AKI
patients prior to discharge and none required (temporary) renal
replacement therapy. Serious gastro-intestinal complications such
as bowel ischemia did not occur. Two patients (3.0%) developed a
postoperative ileus which was successfully, non-surgically, treated.
Overall in-hospital mortality was 1.5% (N = 1) and cause of
death was major neurological injury with subsequent respiratory
failure.
CPB-ASSISTED SURGERY CAUSES ACUTE HEMOLYSIS, INCREASED
PLASMA NO-CONSUMPTION, AND DEPLETION OF PLASMA
HAPTOGLOBIN
Baseline fHb levels were comparable between the three patient
groups (p = 0.78, Figure 1A). During surgery, plasma fHb levels
increased significantly in patients subjected to CPB (p < 0.0001
for CABG, and CABG+Valve surgery patients), peaking at the
end of CPB (6.5 ± 0.9μmol/L, p = 0.041 compared to base￾line for CABG patients, and 18.6 ± 2.9μmol/L, p < 0.0001, for
CABG+Valve patients). After cessation of CPB, plasma fHb con￾centrations gradually decreased over time in these patient groups.

time-points of blood specimens: 1, preoperatively, after induction but
prior to sternotomy; 2, before start of CPB; 3, end CPB; 4, 15 min after
cessation of CPB; 5, 2 h after cessation of CPB; 6, 4 h after cessation of
CPB; 7, day 1 postoperatively; 8, day 2 postoperatively. CPB was not
used in OPCAB patients.
Both peak fHb levels and total release of fHb (AUCfHb) was sig￾nificantly correlated to CPB-duration (Rs = 0.50, p < 0.001, and
Rs = 0.55, p < 0.001, respectively). Hemolysis did not occur in
OPCAB patients (change of plasma fHb over time: p = 0.22).
The kinetics of plasma NO-consumption was similar to that
of plasma fHb in all study groups (Figure 1B). Plasma NO￾consumption only significantly increased in patients subjected
to on-pump surgery (p < 0.001 for CABG and CABG+Valve
patients), while baseline NO-consumption was statistically equal
between the study groups (p = 0.18). The NO-consuming capac￾ity of plasma peaked at the end of CPB, having increased 2.4 fold
in CABG patients, and 7.9 fold in CABG+Valve surgery patients.
Consistent with the potent NO-scavenging property of fHb, the
AUCfHb correlated significantly to total plasma NO-consumption
(AUCNO, r2 = 0.75, p < 0.0001, Figure 1C).
Physiologically, the plasma protein Hp acts as a buffer against
increases in plasma fHb levels through the formation of Hp￾fHb complexes resulting in fHb clearance from the circulation
(Kristiansen et al., 2001). This way, excessive hemolysis can
potentially result in a significant reduction of Hp bioavailability
(Tabbara, 1992). Indeed, plasma Hp dropped significantly over
time in CABG and CABG+Valve surgery patients (p < 0.0001,
for both groups, Figure 1D) suggestive of Hp-fHb complex clear￾ance. Loss of circulating Hp was most marked in CABG+Valve
surgery patients compared to CABG patients, which related to the
higher plasma fHb levels in this patient group. The first statisti￾cally significant decrease in plasma Hp was measured at the end
of CPB, and concentrations further declined during the postoper￾ative period reaching lowest levels 2 and 4 h after cessation of CPB
in CABG and CABG+Valve surgery patients (0.69 ± 0.11 g/L, p <
0.0001, and 0.47 ± 0.07 g/L, p < 0.0001, respectively). The maxi￾mum increase of plasma fHb correlated significantly to the max￾imum decrease of Hp (r2 = 0.28, p < 0.0001, data not shown).
Similar to fHb and NO-consumption, Hp levels remained rel￾atively constant in OPCAB patients throughout surgery (p =
0.059). The observed increase of Hp after reaching lowest lev￾els 4 h after cessation of CPB was suggestive of enhanced Hp
production and subsequent release of Hp into the circulation.

CPB-INDUCED HEMOLYSIS IS ASSOCIATED WITH VISCERAL INJURY
AND CLINICAL ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY
The development of renal tubular injury and intestinal mucosal
injury was studied using urinary NAG (Figure 2A) and plasma
IFABP (Figure 2B). Both parameters were similar in all
groups at baseline (p = 0.859, and p = 0.697, respectively), and
increased significantly during CABG and CABG+Valve surgery
(p < 0.0001, and p < 0.001 for NAG and IFABP, respectively).
OPCAB patients did not display significant changes of NAG or
IFABP over time (p = 0.235 and p = 0.062, respectively). The
potential relation between acute hemolysis and visceral organ
injury in patients undergoing cardiac surgery was studied by
correlation of AUCfHb, AUCNAG, and AUCIFABP(Figures 2C,D).
Both renal injury and intestinal damage were significantly cor￾related with the extent of hemolysis during surgery (Rs = 0.70,
p < 0.0001, and Rs= 0.26, p = 0.04, respectively), albeit this
correlation was stronger for renal tubular injury. Importantly,
the correlation between hemolysis, renal tubular damage, and
intestinal injury remained statistically significant after correc￾tion for four other potential confounders using multivariable
logistic regression (Tables 1, 2, respectively). The correlation
between NO-consumption and both tissue injury markers was
comparable to their correlation with fHb (Rs = 0.55, p = 0.002,
and Rs = 0.41, p = 0.03, for NAG and IFABP respectively, data
not shown), suggestive of a causal role of fHb-induced NO￾scavenging in the development of visceral injury during cardiac
surgery.
Finally, we studied the relation between hemolysis and devel￾opment of AKI as defined by an increase in serum creatinine =
150% compared to preoperative values within 48 h after surgery
(Mehta et al., 2007). Clinical characteristics of non-AKI and
AKI patients are depicted in Supplementary Table 2. Patients
developing postoperative AKI were already identifiable during
surgery as they displayed significantly higher fHb levels at the
end of CPB compared to non-AKI patients (24.4 ± 7.6 vs.
9.6 ± 1.2μmol/L, p < 0.01, Figure 3A). AKI patients also showed
significantly higher NAG levels at the end of CPB, indicating more
profound renal tubular injury compared to non-AKI patients
(11.9 ± 5.7 U/mmol vs. 4.2 ± 0.5 U/mmol, p < 0.05, Figure 3B).
We could not analyze NO-consumption in AKI and non-AKI

and NAG (C), and fHb and IFABP (D), estimated using the area under
the curve (AUC), were significantly correlated (Rs = 0.70, p < 0.0001, and
Rs = 0.26, p = 0.04, respectively). Plasma IFABP values were corrected
for hematocrit because of significant intraoperative hemodilution, urinary
NAG levels were corrected for urine creatinine values. Values are mean

used in OPCAB patients.

DISCUSSION
In the current study we are the first to demonstrate that hemoly￾sis occurring during cardiothoracic surgery strongly correlates to
increased plasma NO-consumption. Moreover, hemolysis is cor￾related to the development of intestinal mucosal injury and AKI.
Patients subjected to more complex types of cardiac surgery, such
as combined bypass and cardiac valve surgery, appear to be at
highest risk.
The adverse effect of hemolysis on the intravascular NO￾metabolism is increasingly appreciated as an important patho￾physiological mechanism in the development of complications in
various clinical settings. The discovery of oxygenated plasma fHb
(HbFe2+O2) as a potent scavenger of endothelial-derived NO has
provided an explanation for the development of gastro-intestinal
smooth muscle dystonias, vasculopathy, endothelial dysfunction,
renal injury, pulmonary hypertension, and increased coagula￾tion in patients with chronic hemolytic disease, patients under￾going hemodialysis and increased mortality in septic patients
(Reiter et al., 2002; Rother et al., 2005). In the present study,
acutely enhanced fHb concentrations during surgery caused a
2.4-fold increase in plasma NO-consumption in CABG patients
(compared to preoperative levels), and a 7.9-fold increase in
CABG+Valve patients, in whom plasma NO-consumption lev￾els of 266μmol/L were observed. As plasma NO-consumption
levels of approximately 10–15μmol/L already have been related
to a significant impairment in NO-dependent fore-arm blood
flow response in patients, reflective of impaired (microcircula￾tory) perfusion, the extent of NO-consumption measured in these
patients is of clinical significance (Reiter et al., 2002; Meyer et al.,
2010). Such a decrease in NO-bioavailability promotes vasocon￾striction, platelet aggregation, up regulation of adhesion molecule

expression, and stimulation of vascular leucocyte adhesion and
inflammation (Reiter et al., 2002).
Hemolysis is a well-recognized consequence of CPB, and has
been shown to increase with longer perfusion times. (Cheung
et al., 2007; Vercaemst, 2008). Three factors principally contribute
to the development of CPB-induced hemolysis: (1) exposure of
RBCs to mechanical forces, particularly shear stress(Vercaemst,
2008), (2) contact of blood with air or non-endothelial sur￾faces (Dejam et al., 2007), and (3) use of suction pressures
(Gregoretti, 1996). In addition, the development of sublethal RBC
damage, promoting premature intravascular RBC disintegration
and altering the rheological properties of blood, further con￾tribute to increased fHb levels during surgery (Watanabe et al.,
2007). Furthermore, autotransfusion devices and transfusion of
stored red blood cells may contribute to increased fHb levels

Vermeulen Windsant et al. Hemolysis and postoperative organ injury
during cardiac surgery by causing significant sublethal damage to
red blood cells, making them prone to premature intravascular
lysis (Vercaemst, 2008; Kim-Shapiro et al., 2011; Vermeulen
Windsant et al., 2012b). In line, we measured highest fHb levels in
CABG+Valve surgery patients, exposed to the longest CPB times,
and requiring the highest number of stored red blood cell trans￾fusions. This may be further explained by increased red blood cell
trauma induced by active pericardial suction. In contrast, OPCAB
patients did not display significant changes of plasma fHb over
time.
As the development of hemolysis during CPB is well known,
there have been several, albeit a few, studies reporting on the
adverse relation between intraoperative hemolysis and patient
outcome after cardiovascular surgery. These studies all focused
on the direct toxic effect of fHb on the renal epithelium by
fHb-induced generation of damaging reactive oxygen species
(catalyzed by free heme and iron), and formation of obstruc￾tive casts (Zager and Gamelin, 1989; Tanaka et al., 1991; Davis
et al., 1999; Baumgart and Dignass, 2002; Haase et al., 2007).
As fHb was believed to be merely nephrotoxic after glomerular
filtration, a correlation between hemolysis and injury of other
organs in the context of CPB has, to our knowledge, never been
reported. The additional NO-scavenging property of fHb, next to
its nephrotoxic effect, could however explain the stronger cor￾relation between hemolysis and renal injury compared to the
correlation between hemolysis and intestinal injury in this study.
The fact that in this setting hemolysis correlates with injury of
two independent organ systems has significant implications for
the (potential) harmful effect of fHb on other tissues. It has been
reported that fHb impairs left ventricular function and coro￾nary blood flow in neonatal rabbit hearts, particularly following
ischemia and reperfusion (Nemeto et al., 2000). Furthermore, the
correlation between hemolysis and pulmonary hypertension in
the setting of chronic hemolysis is well established (Gladwin et al.,
2004).
The results of this study offer a window of opportunity
to reduce surgery related morbidity and mortality, particu￾larly in high risk patients. Inactivation of fHb or increasing
NO-bioavailability may maintain vascular homeostasis, stimu￾late microcirculatory blood flow, and thus limit tissue injury
during CPB-assisted cardiac surgery. Four therapeutic options
are of particular interest in the current setting. First, pro￾phylactic and/or therapeutical administration of (recombinant)
Hp could counteract the depletion of Hp we observed dur￾ing, and after surgery. In fact, administration of Hp signifi￾cantly reduced urinary NAG levels and prevented hemoglobinuria
in 14 patients undergoing CABG surgery with CPB (Tanaka
et al., 1991). Unfortunately, high costs currently limit clin￾ical implementation of routine Hp supplementation, though
plasma transfusion could be an option. Second, administra￾tion of NO-gas via the oxygenator or ventilation gas, analo￾gous to inhaled NO (iNO), may prove to be beneficial. INO,
already at very low concentrations (80 ppm), inactivates fHb in
the pulmonary vasculature through oxidation, and reduces the
NO-consuming capacity of plasma (Reiter et al., 2002). INO
enhances the formation of NO-metabolites, such as nitrate and
nitrite, which are important for intravascular NO-transport and
cytoprotection (Lundberg et al., 2008). Also, iNO decreases shear
stress induced sublethal RBC damage (Baskurt et al., 2004).
Inhaled NO is already clinically used in various settings (Bloch
et al., 2007), and it neither alters NO-consumption in healthy
volunteers nor results in significant methemoglobinemia (Reiter
et al., 2002). Third, the direct oral or intravenous administra￾tion of nitrite or nitrate to increase the plasma NO-donor pool
could be worth investigating (Lundberg et al., 2008). Finally, the
administration of drugs directly activating or stimulating sol￾uble guanylate cyclase, promoting vasodilation independent of
endogenous NO, may be a promising new approach (Raat et al.,
2013).
The main strength of our study is the inclusion of patients
undergoing different types of cardiac surgery of various com￾plexity. This allowed identification of patients at highest risk for
hemolysis-induced organ injury; those who may benefit from
hemolysis-targeted therapeutic interventions. Furthermore, the
exclusion of patients with preoperative CKD limited confounding
on the outcome measures renal tubular injury and postopera￾tive AKI. Nevertheless, we cannot exclude presence of preop￾erative CKD with mildly impaired or preserved renal function
(stage 1 and 2 CKD according to the KDOQI classification,
2002) as a confounding factor, as we did not have informa￾tion on the presence of structural or functional renal damage.
The main limitations are inherent to the observational nature
of the study. First, it is not possible to determine causation
from the presented data. Second, the number of adverse clin￾ical events (AKI) was relatively low, and thus precludes firm
conclusions as to the impact of hemolysis on adverse clinical
outcome. Furthermore, no patient developed clinical transmural
intestinal necrosis, hence a clear correlation between hemolysis
and clinical intestinal injury could not be made. Nevertheless,
the significant increase in plasma IFABP levels (and its corre￾lation to increased fHb concentrations) reflects mucosal intesti￾nal damage, which has been clearly associated with promotion
of a pro-inflammatory response syndrome and adverse clin￾ical outcome (Hanssen et al., 2008; Grootjans et al., 2010).
Third, it cannot be excluded that increased hemolysis and NO￾consumption are a consequence of increased morbidity rather
than a mediator. Finally, other potential mechanisms underlying
the relation between intravascular hemolysis and kidney damage,
such as heme induced oxidative damage were not investigated
and may be important in this setting (Baumgart and Dignass,
2002).
In conclusion, this study demonstrates a significant adverse
relation between enhanced plasma fHb levels, decreased plasma
NO-bioavailability, AKI, and organ integrity loss during car￾diac surgery. Patients undergoing complex cardiac surgery,
such as combined valve and CABG surgery, appear to be
at highest risk for hemolysis-induced organ injury, proba￾bly potentiated by long perfusion times and high transfu￾sion requirements. These results call for increased awareness
for the adverse consequences of even modest increases in
plasma fHb during cardiac surgery and additional studies are
needed to investigate whether inactivation of fHb or abro￾gation of its effects on the (micro)circulation significantly
attenuates the development of visceral tissue injury and AKI,
