Primary liver malignancy has been increasing in incidence
over the past several decades, and the liver remains a
common site of metastatic recurrence.1,2 Surgical resection
and liver transplantation are currently the only curative
therapies for patients with liver malignancies. Because liver
transplantation is limited by donor shortages and strict
transplant criteria, liver resection is the mainstay of curative
therapy. Improved surgical technique and the liver's unique
ability to regenerate allows for the resection of most of the
liver, if necessary.3 However, large-volume resections place
patients at risk for complications of liver insufficiency, par￾ticularly in the perioperative period before the remnant has
increased in volume. Although causes of perioperative liver
insufficiency are multifactorial, the percentage of liver that
remains after surgery, termed the future liver remnant (FLR),
has been shown to be a strong, independent predictor of
postsurgical hepatic dysfunction and complications.4,5 Pre￾operative portal vein embolization (PVE) is a safe image￾guided procedure that causes hypertrophy of the FLR by
redirecting portal blood to the non-tumor-bearing liver.
When appropriately applied, PVE has been shown to reduce
postoperative morbidity and increase the number of patients
eligible for curative intent resection. This article reviews the
rationale, technical considerations, and current utilization of
preoperative PVE.
Mechanisms of Liver Regeneration
The atrophy-hypertrophy complex refers to the controlled
liver regeneration that occurs after hepatocyte injury due to
toxicity, vascular occlusion, or trauma. Although termed
hypertrophy, regeneration occurs mainly from hyperplasia,
or an increase in cell number, rather than simply an increase
in cell size.6 Under normal circumstances, the adult liver is
relatively quiescent with a tiny fraction of cells (<0.01%)
undergoing mitosis. However, after regional injury, the non￾injured liver rapidly undergoes regeneration. The degree of

Abstract Portal vein embolization (PVE) is a technique used before hepatic resection to increase
the size of liver segments that will remain after surgery. This therapy redirects portal
blood to segments of the future liver remnant (FLR), resulting in hypertrophy. PVE is
indicated when the FLR is either too small to support essential function or marginal in
size and associated with a complicated postoperative course. When appropriately
applied, PVE has been shown to reduce postoperative morbidity and increase the
number of patients eligible for curative intent resection. PVE is also being combined
with other therapies in novel ways to improve surgical outcomes. This article reviews the
rationale, technical considerations, and current use of preoperative PVE.

hyperplasia is proportional to the degree of injury. Small
insults result in localized mitotic response; however, injury
involving greater than 10% of liver volume leads to a more
generalized response in the remaining liver, with up to 95% of
cells undergoing mitosis. In fact, following resection of a two￾thirds hepatectomy, the liver can regenerate lost volume
within 2 weeks.7
Animal models and postresection studies have shown that
regeneration is stimulated by growth factors released by the
liver, as well as extrahepatic growth factors transported by
the portal vein.8 The crucial role of the portal vein is evi￾denced by the fact that the greatest hypertrophy occurs in the
periportal zone, with a decreasing gradient toward the
hepatic vein.9 In addition, Doppler studies have demonstrat￾ed that the degree and timing of liver regeneration correlates
with the transient increase in portal flow following PVE.10
Proposed mechanisms of hypertrophy based on animal
modeling are multifactorial and include the release of nitrous
oxide stimulated by portal pressure changes, release of intra￾hepatic growth factors and cytokines such as transforming
growth factor-α and tumor necrosis factor(TNF)-α, and gut￾derived growth factors carried by the portal vein. Hepatocyte
growth factor (HGF) plays a central role in liver regeneration.
In addition to its direct effects on hepatocyte replication, HGF
also stimulates the release of cytokines such as interleukin-6
and TNF-α, which also promote regeneration.11
These mechanisms may explain the diminished or delayed
liver regeneration observed in people with diabetes with
insulin resistance and patients with cirrhosis. Insulin is
known to play an important role in liver regeneration by
acting synergistically with HGF and other growth factors.12
The decreased regenerative capacity observed with cirrhotic
livers may result from a poor response to growth factors and
diminished portal flow rates. Despite advances in under￾standing, the details of hypertrophy following PVE are not
well understood and inferred largely based on animal models.
Observational studies have demonstrated that regeneration
after PVE occurs slower than after hepatic resection, possibly
due to apoptosis, as opposed to frank necrosis, which occurs
after PVE.13
Rationale
In 1990, Makuuchi et al published the first report of PVE for
the purpose of inducing hypertrophy of nonembolized liver
segments before resection.14 They proposed that PVE could
improve surgical outcomes by mitigating the sudden rise in
portal pressure that otherwise occurs during surgery, as well
as prevent perioperative liver dysfunction by increasing FLR
mass. This rationale was confirmed in subsequent studies
showing that increased FLR volume is associated with im￾proved biliary excretion, albumin uptake, and postoperative
liver function testing.15–17
PVE is a safe procedure that causes few adverse effects and
can be performed on an outpatient basis. Most large series
report 0% procedure-related mortality.18 After PVE, half of the
patients experience no significant change in liver function
tests, and the other half demonstrate small fluctuations that
return to baseline after 3 days. Other laboratory values such as
white blood cell count change minimally, if at all, and markers
of synthetic function such as albumin levels or prothrombin
time are typically unaffected.19 PVE is also well tolerated by
patients. Unlike the postembolization syndrome that occurs
after arterial embolization, patients rarely experience nausea,
fever, or significant pain. This is attributed to the observation
that PVE primarily causes apoptosis rather than ischemic
necrosis, thus limiting the release of inflammatory signalers.
Assessment of Future Liver Remnant
Before major hepatectomy, multiphase contrast-enhanced
computed tomography (CT) is obtained for preoperative
planning and FLR evaluation. The vascular landmarks for
hepatic resection are identified, and FLR volume is assessed
by CT measurements. This entails outlining the FLR on each
axial slice followed by computations based on slice thickness.
The absolute size of the FLR, however, is not sufficient to
predict which patients will benefit from PVE. This is because
larger patients require a larger liver mass to support essential
functions compared with smaller patients. FLR must there￾fore be standardized relative to patient size as a ratio of FLR to
total functional liver volume. Standardized FLR (sFLR), ex￾pressed as a percentage of total functioning liver volume, can
be compared between patients and surgical outcome data to
determine if PVE is indicated.
To calculate sFLR, the entire functioning liver volume must
be ascertained. This can also be accomplished by CT volumet￾ric calculations by measuring the entire liver volume and
subtracting the volume of tumor within the liver. However,
tumor burden is often extensive, making this method tedious
and imprecise. In addition, liver tumors that are infiltrative or
with indistinct borders can be difficult to measure directly.
Alternatively, total estimated liver volume (TELV) can be
calculated using a formula based on the close relationship
between body surface area (BSA) and functional liver volume.
Vauthey et al developed the following formula by analyzing
liver size and body surface area in 292 western adults20
TELV ¼ 794.41 þ 1267.28 (BSA).
Although multiple similar formulas exist in the literature, a
meta-analysis comparing several variations found the Vau￾they formula to be the least biased and most accurate for adult
patients.21 In addition, this method of calculating sFLR (volu￾metric FLR/TELV) has been shown to correlate strongly with
clinical outcomes.5,22
Patient Selection
Multiple factors are taken into account in deciding which
patients would benefit from PVE. These include the extent of
liver resection, baseline liver function, and complexity of the
planned surgery. PVE is indicated in cases where the FLR is
either too small to support essential function or is borderline
and associated with a complicated postoperative course.
The indocyanine green (ICG) clearance test was initially
designed to study blood flow but has become an important
tool for quantifying liver function. ICG is a tricarbocyanine dye
that binds albumin and distributes in the blood pool shortly
after injection. ICG is cleared from the body exclusively via
biliary excretion. The degree of excretion can be calculated

either by serum blood test or via an optical sensor placed on
the finger. Within 20 minutes of injection, 97% of the dye
should be cleared by the liver. For analysis prior to PVE,
the ICG-R15 test is typically used. This value describes the
percentage of ICG that remains in the blood 15 minutes after
injection. Higher ICG-R15 values indicate decreased hepatic
reserve and the need for increased FLR.23
In patients with normal liver function, an FLR as low as 10%
can support essential hepatic function.22 However, multiple
studies have demonstrated that postoperative complications
and length of stay are significantly reduced among patients
with sFLR >20%.5,22,24 Therefore, for patients with normal
livers, PVE is advocated for sFLR <20%.
Liver injury evidenced by hepatic steatosis or exposure to
hepatotoxic chemotherapy is also considered in selecting
patients for PVE. Hepatic steatosis has been identified as a
risk factor for developing postresection surgical complica￾tions.25 In one case-control study, patients with hepatic
steatosis had significantly higher rates of postoperative he￾patic dysfunction, blood transfusions, and stays in the inten￾sive care unit (ICU).26 Retrospective studies have also found a
correlation between hepatotoxic chemotherapy regimens
and postoperative complications.27 Although no evidence￾based cutoffs are currently available, many consider PVE for
patients with sFLR <30% and either hepatic steatosis or
significant exposure to hepatotoxic chemotherapy.
Many patients with cirrhosis are not considered candi￾dates for major hepatic resection owing to an unacceptable
risk of perioperative death. However, a select group with
Childs-Pugh class A cirrhosis and preserved liver function
(ICG-R15 test <10%) are considered for resection if their sFLR
is >40%, below which PVE is indicated.28 This is supported by
the only prospective trial comparing PVE before right hepa￾tectomy. This study found decreased postoperative compli￾cations, ICU admissions, and length of hospital stay for
patients with chronic liver disease who underwent PVE.29
In addition, a 40% cutoff recommendation has been extended
to patients with prolonged biliary obstruction.
In addition to the guidelines just discussed, other factors
are considered in determining whether any individual pa￾tient should undergo PVE. These include patient age, comor￾bidities such as diabetes, and the complexity of the planned
resection such as concomitant partial pancreatectomy. Until
evidence-based indications are further defined, the indica￾tion for PVE in these patient populations is decided on an
individual basis.
Contraindications
The two absolute contraindications to PVE are extensive
ipsilateral tumor thrombus and clinically evident portal
hypertension. In the setting of extensive ipsilateral tumor
thrombus, PVE is contraindicated because most of the portal
flow has already been diverted, and safe delivery of embolic
agent is difficult.30 Clinically evident portal hypertension is a
contraindication to hepatectomy, and therefore PVE is not
indicated. PVE in the setting of mild portal hypertension or
advanced fibrosis is feasible but considered relatively contra￾indicated owing to the increased risk of nontarget emboliza￾tion and complications such as bleeding esophageal varices.5
Other relative contraindications include uncorrectable coa￾gulopathy and renal insufficiency.
Technical Considerations
The goal of PVE is to achieve complete portal occlusion of
targeted segments. Embolizing the entire portal tree includ￾ing distal branches is important to prevent portoportal
shunts. In addition, it is critical to target all diseased segments
to maximize hypertrophy of the FLR and prevent hypertrophy
of segments planned for resection.
A variety of embolic agents have been described for PVE
including n-butyl cyanoacrylate (NBCA) and ethiodized oil,
fibrin glue, ethanol, and microparticles such as polyvinyl
alcohol or trisacryl gelatin. The ideal embolic agent should
be well tolerated by the patient, cause complete occlusion
without subsequent recanalization, and be easy to adminis￾ter. No randomized studies have compared various agents,
and retrospective comparisons demonstrate similar efficacy.
Each agent carries its own unique technical demands, and
selection to date should be guided by operator preference and
technical factors relating to catheter approach.
The vast majority of PVE procedures target the right lobe
before right hepatectomy (RPVE) or the right lobe plus
segment 4 (RPVE þ 4) prior to extended right hepatectomy.
Left lobe PVE is rarely indicated because the right lobe is
asymmetrically larger than the left and typically sufficient in
size to support function. Volumetric studies have shown that
even with extended left hepatectomy (segments 2, 3, and 4
with extension to the caudate), sFLR is typically >33%.
However, extended right hepatectomy typically leaves an
sFLR <20%.31
PVE can be performed using transileocolic, ipsilateral, or
contralateral approaches. The oldest, transileocolic portal
vein embolization, is a surgical procedure performed under
general anesthesia.32 A right lower quadrant incision is made
and a vascular sheath introduced directly into an ileocolic
venous branch. A catheter is then advanced under fluoro￾scopic guidance into the portal vein for subsequent emboli￾zation. This avoids direct puncture of the liver, which is
particularly advantageous when there is large tumor burden
and concern for peritoneal seeding. However, this approach
carries the obvious drawbacks of an invasive procedure and
general anesthesia. Initial descriptions of PVE used the tran￾sileocolic approach, which is still performed by surgeons in
Asia and in select cases when a surgical procedure is planned
for other purposes. However, most centers with dedicated
interventional radiology services prefer transhepatic
approaches.
Percutaneous portal vein embolization can be achieved via
an ipsilateral approach (through the tumor-bearing liver) or
contralateral approach (through the FLR). We describe these
techniques with reference to the standard RPVE (►Fig. 1) or
RPVE þ4 (►Fig. 2). For either approach, a distal portal branch
is accessed under ultrasound guidance. After a vascular
sheath is secured, flush portography is performed to assess
for variations in portovenous anatomy. In addition, portal
pressures are measured throughout the procedure because

significant portal hypertension is a contraindication to he￾patic resection.
At our institution, we typically embolize using trisacryl
gelatin microspheres (EmboGold Microspheres, Biosphere
Medical, Rockland, MA). Smaller particles are infused initially
to treat smaller distal branches, with a stepwise increase in
microsphere caliber size until near-complete stasis is
achieved. Care is taken to avoid nontarget embolization.
Following particulate embolization, 0.035- to 0.038-inch
embolization coils (Gianturco, Cook Medical, Bloomington,
IN) are placed centrally to prevent recanalization.
We perform the ipsilateral approach when technically
feasible. In this approach, the portal venous system is ac￾cessed through the tumor-bearing liver (i.e., liver to be

resected). Anterior branches of the right portal vein are
typically targeted because these have been associated with
a lower complication rate.33 For RPVE þ 4, we prefer to treat
segment 4 first, which avoids the potential difficulty of
exchanging catheters through the previously embolized right
portal system, as well as the risk of dislodging embolic
material during segment 4 embolization. Furthermore, if
thrombus or injury inadvertently occurs to the left portal
vein during segment 4 embolization, the procedure can be
terminated and treatment options reassessed. If the right
portal system has already been embolized and nontarget
embolization to the left portal branches occurs, few treat￾ment options remain for the patient. Despite these benefits,
some operators choose to embolize the right system first
because segment 4 vessels subsequently dilate, making cath￾eterization of segment 4 branches easier.
Embolization of the right hepatic lobe segments via the
ipsilateral approach can be technically challenging owing to
the acute angles of the segmental branches. For this reason,
reverse curve catheters are used to facilitate access. Final
portography is performed through the working catheter
rather than exchanging for a flush catheter to minimize the

risk of dislodging embolic material. The access tract is then
embolized to minimize the risk of bleeding at the puncture
site.
For the contralateral approach, access is obtained by
puncture through the FLR (►Fig. 3). Segment 3 branches
are commonly targeted because their anterior position allows
for easier percutaneous access as well as less acute angles for
right portal vein embolization. With this approach, segment 4
is typically embolized following right liver embolization. The
contralateral approach has the advantage of easy catheter
manipulation to the right lobe segments. In addition, inter￾ventions such as biliary drainage in the setting of Klatskin's
tumor or thermal ablation of localized disease in the FLR can
be achieved at the time of PVE. However, the contralateral
approach requires vascular access through the FLR, which can
be injured during the procedure.
We prefer the ipsilateral approach because this spares the
FLR from the potential damage and associated complication of
vascular access. The technical challenge of acute angles can be
overcome with the use of reverse curve catheters. The ipsi￾lateral approach does require access through the diseased
liver, which can be problematic in cases of extensive tumor
burden. Access through the tumor should be avoided due to
the risk of peritoneal seeding. If safe access is not possible, the
contralateral approach is a reasonable alternative.
Complications
Complications of percutaneous PVE are similar to other
transhepatic procedures. These include subscapular hemato￾ma, hemobilia, hemoperitoneum, vascular injuries, pneumo￾thorax, and cholangitis. Complications specific to PVE include
nontarget embolization, recanalization of embolized seg￾ments, and complete portal vein thrombosis. The quality
improvement guidelines for PVE published in 2010 by the
Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiological Society of
Europe assigns an acceptable minor complication rate up to
25% and major complication rate no greater than 5%.34
Abulkhir et al published a meta-analysis in 2008, pooling
data from 37 studies with a total of 1088 subjects that
included both percutaneous and ileocolic approaches.18 The
overall morbidity was 2.2%, with 0% procedure-related mor￾tality. Similarly low adverse event rates have been published

in other series. Di Stefano et al reported adverse events in
12.8% of patients (24 of 188) who underwent PVE via a
contralateral approach.35 Complications in this series includ￾ed complete portal vein thrombosis (n ¼ 1), inadvertent
NBCA migration to the left portal vein (n ¼ 1), hemobilia
(n ¼ 1), rupture of metastasis into the gallbladder (n ¼ 1),
and transient liver failure (n ¼ 6).35 Kodama et al reviewed 47
percutaneous PVEs in 46 patients (11 via the contralateral
approach).33 Complications occurred more frequently in the
punctured lobe, leading the authors to recommend the
ipsilateral approach. Complication rates after PVE appear to
be higher in patients with chronic liver disease owing to an
increased risk of thrombosis of the nonembolized portal vein.
Outcomes
The degree of hypertrophy expected after PVE differs de￾pending on the degree of underlying liver disease. Patients
with otherwise normal livers regenerate at 2 weeks post￾procedure at a rate of 12 to 21 cm3
/day, compared with
9 cm3
/day in cirrhotic patients.36 In normal livers, sufficient
hypertrophy typically occurs within 2 to 4 weeks, whereas
regeneration in patients with cirrhosis can take 4 weeks.
Cirrhosis is a common comorbidity faced because hepato￾cellular carcinoma (HCC) frequently develops in the setting of
advanced liver disease. Although most patients with cirrhosis
do not meet resection criteria, those who are considered for
resection require a relatively robust sFLR (>40%) to lower
their acceptable risk of postoperative liver insufficiency and
mortality. PVE has been shown successful in increasing the
number of cirrhotic patients eligible for surgery and concom￾itantly improving perioperative outcome. Azoulay et al per￾formed PVE on 10 patients with HCC and cirrhosis who had a
sFLR <40%.37 In this study, PVE resulted in hypertrophy and
allowing for subsequent resection in all 10 patients. The PVE
group's overall and disease-free survival was similar to the 19
patients who did not undergo PVE. Palavecino et al published
retrospective data of 54 patients with HCC, 21 of whom
received PVE before hepatectomy involving at least three
segments.38 There were no perioperative deaths in the PVE
group compared with six perioperative deaths (18%) in the
non-PVE group (p ¼ 0.038). Excluding perioperative deaths,
overall and disease-free survival rates were similar between
the two groups.
In patients with normal liver function, PVE is indicated
when sFLR is <20%, as is often the case before extended right
hepatectomy. Multiple studies have demonstrated improved
outcomes in patients with normal liver function undergoing
RPVE þ 4. A large published series of 301 consecutive pa￾tients who underwent extended right hepatectomy found
that mortality and postoperative liver insufficiency rates
were significantly higher in patients with FLR <20%
(p < 0.05), but no difference was demonstrated between
patients with FLR between 20% and 30% and patients >30%.24
Sequential Arterial and Portal Embolization
Transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) is com￾monly used to provide locoregional control of unresectable
HCC, as well as being performed as a bridge to transplant.39 In
addition, interest has developed in applying this therapy in
sequence with PVE prior to hepatectomy for HCC. There are
several theoretical benefits of this combination therapy. As
discussed earlier, cirrhotic livers demonstrate a decreased
propensity to regenerate and often require longer time
intervals to achieve satisfactory hypertrophy. Necrosis, as
occurs after TACE, typically leads to increased rates of liver
regeneration. In addition, HCC, which often arises in the
setting of cirrhosis, derives it blood supply preferentially
from the hepatic artery. After PVE, hepatic arterial flow
within the embolized segment increases (termed the hepatic
artery buffer response), which can lead to an accelerated
growth of tumors.40 TACE may therefore provide local control
of tumors during the interval between PVE and resection.
Finally, HCC is associated with the formation of arterioportal
shunts that can attenuate the effects of PVE, which is typically
performed upstream from the shunts.41 These arterioportal
shunts are also targeted during TACE.
Ogata et al published an analysis of 36 patients with HCC
and cirrhosis who underwent resection after PVE; 18 of these
patients (50%) had TACE 3 weeks prior to PVE.42 The mean
increase in FLR volume was higher for the TACE plus PVE
group compared with PVE alone (12.5% versus 8.4%;
p ¼ 0.022). The TACE plus PVE group also had a significantly
increased incidence of complete tumor necrosis (15 of 18 vs 1
of 18; p < 0.001) and a statistically significant higher 5-year
disease-free survival (37% versus 19%; p ¼ 0.041).
More recently, Yoo et al reported their results of 135
patients with HCC, 71 of whom underwent TACE plus PVE
and 64 who underwent PVE only (prior to right hepatecto￾my).43 In this series, PVE was performed an average of
1.2 months after TACE. The TACE plus PVE group had a
higher mean increase in sFLR (7.3% versus 5.8%; p ¼ 0.035),
as well as improved overall (p ¼ 0.028) and recurrence-free
(p ¼ 0.001) survival.
Portal Vein Embolization and Two-Stage Hepatectomy
Two-stage hepatectomy was developed as a means of provid￾ing potentially curative therapy to patients with colorectal
metastases confined to both lobes of the liver. Using tradi￾tional criteria, this pattern of disease was previously consid￾ered unresectable. However, a two-stage surgical approach,
often using hypertrophy following PVE, can provide a curative
option to carefully selected patients. During the first stage of
hepatectomy, tumor within the FLR is resected or, in some
cases, ablated. Once the FLR is devoid of tumor, PVE can be
performed to increase its mass. PVE is often necessary
because these patients typically receive hepatotoxic neo￾adjuvant chemotherapy, and therefore a FLR >30% is pre￾ferred. After PVE, a right or extended right hepatectomy can
be safely performed.
Narita et al reported on the outcome of 61 patients who
completed two-stage hepatectomy, all but 3 of whom incor￾porated PVE or ligation.44 The 5-year overall survival was 32%,
and overall median survival was 39.6 months. In a separate
study, Brouquet et al reported outcomes of 65 patients who
underwent first-stage hepatectomy and 47 who completed

the two-stage hepatectomy.45 The overall 5-year survival rate
was 51% for the group and 64% for the 47 patients who
completed the second-stage resection.
Future Directions
Stem cell infusion in conjunction with PVE has gained interest
as a means of promoting the rate and degree of FLR hyper￾trophy. In animal models, hematopoietic stem cells from the
bone marrow have been shown to enter the liver via the
portal vein and participate in regeneration.46 This finding is
corroborated in humans; liver biopsies from patients who
had undergone allogeneic stem cell transplant demonstrated
donor DNA within regenerated hepatocytes.47,48 Researchers
have subsequently investigated the infusion of hematopoietic
stem cells into the FLR during PVE. One recent study reports
on the portal infusion of CD133þ bone marrow derived stem
cells (SC) in conjunction with PVE.49 PVE with portal infusion
of CD133þ stem cells (PVE plus SC) was performed on 11
patients, and results were compared with 11 patients who
underwent PVE only as well as 18 controls. At 14-days
posttreatment, FLR growth was significantly higher for the
PVE plus SC group compared with PVE only (138.66 cm3
versus 62.95 cm3
, respectively; p ¼ 0.004). Future studies are
needed to assess whether SC infusion has an impact on
surgical outcomes and survival.
Other areas of ongoing research include the development
of new embolic agents, new percutaneous approaches, and
the development of better defined criteria for patient
selection.50,51
Conclusion
PVE continues to play an important role in the surgical
management of liver malignancy, allowing for more aggres￾sive resections and safer postoperative courses. Future re￾search and experience will no doubt drive ongoing
refinement of the technique going forward.
