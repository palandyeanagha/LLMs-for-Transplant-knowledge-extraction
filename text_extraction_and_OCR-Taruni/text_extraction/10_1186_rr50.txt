Introduction
During late fetal development, PVR is high and PBF is
limited to less than 10% of combined ventricular output.
This provides adequate nutrition and stimulus for growth
to the lung, while optimizing flow to other fetal tissues
and the placenta. At birth, mechanical distention of the
lungs, increased oxygen tension, and increased shear
stress result in a precipitous decrease in PVR and
increase in PBF to 100% of cardiac output. Failure of this
normal transition leads to persistent right-to-left shunting
across fetal cardiovascular channels, resulting in pro￾found hypoxemia and ultimately death. Even when PVR
decreases normally at birth (Fig. 1), subsequent pul￾monary vasoconstriction in response to hypoxia or other
pressor stimuli can lead to a resumption of right-to-left
shunting across fetal cardiovascular channels, with
potentially fatal consequences. The present review
addresses the contributions of NO, prostacyclin, and
potassium channel activation to the normal transition from
fetal to neonatal pulmonary hemodynamics and to the
defense against postnatal pulmonary vasoconstriction.
Pulmonary vascular resistance during fetal
development
During early fetal development, PBF is limited by the
paucity of pulmonary vessels. The number of fetal pul￾monary vessels increases by an order of magnitude
between mid-gestation and term. PVR remains high during
the last trimester, however, and most of the right heart
output is shunted across the ductus arteriosus and
foramen ovale to the low-resistance systemic circuit. This
is due in part to mechanical compression of pulmonary
vessels by the fluid-filled, atelectatic lungs. In addition,
fetal pulmonary vessels exhibit active tone.
In sheep, at 90–100 days of gestation (term 140 days)
maternal hyperoxia increased fetal partial oxygen tension

Abstract
The high pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) of atelectatic, hypoxic, fetal lungs limits intrauterine
pulmonary blood flow (PBF) to less than 10% of combined right and left ventricular output. At birth, PVR
decreases precipitously to accommodate the entire cardiac output. The present review focuses on the
role of endothelium-derived nitric oxide (NO), prostacyclin, and vascular smooth muscle potassium
channels in mediating the decrease in PVR that occurs at birth, and in maintaining reduced pulmonary
vasomotor tone during the neonatal period. The contribution of vasodilator and vasoconstrictor
modulator activity to the pathophysiology of neonatal pulmonary hypertension is also addressed.

fetal PBF [1]. In contrast, after 115–120 days of gestation
(ie at >75% term) an increase in fetal partial oxygen
tension to 40–50 mmHg was associated with an almost
10-fold increase in PBF [1,2]. Thus, hypoxic pulmonary
vasoconstriction (HPV) appears to develop during the third
trimester when the number of pulmonary vessels increases.
Unlike the mature pulmonary circulation, the fetal pul￾monary vasculature also appears to autoregulate flow
through a myogenic response. This may explain why stimuli
such as ductal compression, endothelium-dependent
vasodilators, and increased oxygen tension cause only a
transient increase in fetal PBF [3,4]. Finally, the balance
between endogenous vasoconstrictor and vasodilator
modulators contribute to the high PVR of the fetus.
Vasoconstrictor modulators in the fetus
Arachidonic acid is metabolized via the cyclo-oxygenase,
lipoxygenase, or cytochrome P450-dependent epoxyge￾nase pathways to both vasodilator and vasoconstrictor
modulators. Whether the epoxygenase metabolites con￾tribute to fetal vasomotor tone has not been established.
The cyclo-oxygenase pathway is active in the fetus [5],
however, and gives rise to both vasodilator prostaglandins
and the vasoconstrictor thromboxane A2. The observation
that thromboxane A2 inhibition caused fetal vasodilatation
[6] provided evidence that thromboxane A2 contributes to
basal PVR in the fetus. Lipoxygenase metabolites of
arachidonic acid, particularly leukotriene D4, may also
contribute to elevated fetal PVR [7], although the impor￾tance of this modulator in maintaining basal tone has been
questioned [8]. More recently, several studies have sug￾gested that the potent endothelium-derived contracting
factor endothelin-1 plays a key role in maintaining high
fetal pulmonary vasomotor tone. Endothelin-1 causes
vasoconstriction by activating endothelin receptor subtype
A (ETA) receptors, and ETA receptor blockade enhanced
the increase in PBF seen during ductal compression in
utero [9]. Furthermore, levels of endothelin-1 mRNA
expression, endothelin-1 peptide, and ETA receptor mRNA
expression are all highest at 125–130 days of gestation in
ovine fetuses, and then decline as term approaches and
the need for vasodilatation becomes paramount [10].
Vasodilator modulators in the fetus
The vasoconstrictor effects of hypoxia, myogenic tone,
and pressor modulators are counterbalanced by several
endogenous vasodilator modulators of vasomotor tone. Of
these, NO and prostacyclin play particularly important
roles in maintaining adequate PBF during fetal develop￾ment and in mediating the precipitous decrease in PVR at
birth. Endothelial, inducible, and neuronal nitric oxide syn￾thase (NOS) have all been identified in fetal lungs.
However, the present review focuses on the role of
endothelium-derived NO, which is synthesized from L-argi￾nine by endothelial NOS in the presence of calcium and
other cofactors. NO diffuses from endothelial cells into
adjacent pulmonary vascular smooth muscle cells, where

it causes vasodilatation through several mechanisms.
These include the classic NO-induced activation of guany￾late cyclase, leading to increased levels of cGMP. The
cGMP in turn stimulates production of a cGMP-depen￾dent kinase that can cause vasodilatation through direct
action on myosin phosphorylation. In addition, there is evi￾dence that NO can directly or indirectly activate vascular
smooth muscle potassium channels, leading to hyperpo￾larization and a decrease in cytosolic calcium in both the
fetal [11] and mature pulmonary vasculature [12].
Immunohistochemical studies [13] have identified endothe￾lial NOS as early as under one-third of term in lamb fetal
lungs. Both expression of the endothelial NOS gene [14]
and the NO-induced increase in cGMP concentration [15]
appear to increase as term approaches. In addition, the
endothelin receptor subtype B (ETB) receptor, which medi￾ates vasodilatation through a NO-dependent mechanism, is
most abundant at term and may explain the apparently para￾doxic vasodilatation seen in response to endothelin-1 infu￾sion in the late gestation fetus [10,16]. Other
endothelium-dependent pulmonary vasodilators that act by
increasing endothelial NOS activity cause acute vasodilata￾tion in fetal pulmonary vessels, and in utero administration of
NOS inhibitors increases fetal PVR and blocks endothe￾lium-dependent vasodilatation [17–19]. Furthermore,
authentic NO, NO donors, and cGMP analogs all cause
vasodilatation of fetal lungs and isolated fetal vessels [2,18].
Vasodilator responses to physiologic as well as pharmaco￾logic stimuli appear to be mediated by NO in the fetus. For
example, endothelial NO synthesis was greater at elevated
oxygen tension in fetal pulmonary arteries [15], and the
increase in fetal lamb PBF caused by maternal hyperoxia
was blocked by NOS inhibition [4]. Shear stress-induced
vasodilatation in the fetus also appeared to be dependent
on NO [20], although this might have been due to
increased inducible as well as endothelial NOS activity.
Like the NOS isoforms, both constitutive and inducible
cyclo-oxygenase (cyclo-oxygenase 1 and 2) are present in
the ovine fetal lung [5]. Infusion of several cyclo-oxyge￾nase metabolites of arachidonic acid (eg prostacyclin, and
prostaglandins E1, E2, D2 and H2) causes vasodilatation of
the high-vascular-resistance fetal pulmonary circulation.
However, prostacyclin is the most potent vasodilator
prostaglandin [8]. Prostacyclin acts on the vascular
smooth muscle by activating adenylate cyclase. The
increased cAMP subsequently causes smooth muscle
relaxation either through a direct effect on myosin phos￾phorylation or by activating a potassium channel via a
cAMP-dependent kinase, leading to vascular smooth
muscle hyperpolarization [21]. Prostacyclin synthesis
increases during the last trimester [22], and several
endothelium-dependent vasodilators, including acetyl￾choline and bradykinin, act at least in part by enhancing
prostacyclin synthesis in the fetus [23]. Prostacyclin does
not appear to contribute to the vasodilatory effects of
maternal hyperoxia [24], however, and cyclo-oxygenase
inhibitors have little effect on basal PVR in the fetus, prob￾ably because they block both vasoconstrictor and
vasodilator prostanoids.
Over the past two decades, calcium-dependent (KCa), ATP￾dependent (KATP), and several voltage-dependent (KV)
potassium channels have been identified on both pulmonary
endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells. Shear stress
can activate endothelial potassium channels, leading to NO
synthesis [25], which then causes vasodilatation as
described above. Vascular smooth muscle cell potassium
channel activation leads to hyperpolarization of the vascular
smooth muscle and to a decrease in cytosolic calcium,
which results in vasodilatation. These channels can be acti￾vated by NO, prostacyclin, and other endothelium-derived
hyperpolarizing factors. Studies of isolated arteries and
intact lambs [26] suggest that vascular smooth muscle KATP
channels are present in fetal lambs, but inhibition of these
channels appears to play little role in regulating basal pul￾monary vasomotor tone. KCa channels are also present in
vascular smooth muscle cells of the fetal pulmonary circula￾tion, and there is evidence [11] that they mediate the NO￾dependent vasodilatation that is seen in response to some
endothelium-dependent vasodilators. KV channels (particu￾larly KV2.1) have been implicated as sensors and mediators
of HPV in mature lungs. There appears to be little KV2.1
activity in the fetal pulmonary circulation, however. Instead,
KCa channels may play an important role in sensing and
mediating fetal and neonatal HPV [27].
Changes in pulmonary vascular resistance at
birth
At birth, PVR must decrease abruptly to accommodate
100% of cardiac output, thus allowing the lungs to
assume their normal extrauterine gas exchange and meta￾bolic functions. Several inter-related stimuli, including
expansion of the lungs, increased oxygen tension and
increased systemic vascular resistance, contribute to the
decrease in PVR. Collectively, these stimuli, as well as the
increase in levels of several endogenous vasoactive sub￾stances, lead to a marked increase in the ratio of vasodila￾tor to vasoconstrictor modulators.
It has long been known that the initiation of rhythmic
breathing causes vasodilatation, even in the absence of an
increase in oxygen tension [28]. This is partly due to
mechanical distension of the lungs, which increases
vessel radius – a key physical determinant of vascular
resistance. In addition, mechanical deformation of the
lungs may directly enhance vasodilator modulator synthe￾sis. Studies of neonatal animals found that ventilation
caused an increase in prostacyclin synthesis [29] and
cyclo-oxygenase inhibition prevented that normal decrease

in PVR associated with rhythmic lung distension at birth
[30,31]. NOS inhibition [32] and KCa channel inhibition [33]
also blunt ventilation-induced pulmonary vasodilatation.
Increased oxygen tension at birth also reduces PVR, even
in the absence of ventilation [28]. This is partly due to the
loss of HPV. The mechanism of HPV remains uncertain,
but several factors appear to contribute to the response.
Recent studies of mature animal preparations [34,35]
support the hypothesis that hypoxia causes ETA-mediated
inhibition of a KV channel; this leads to vessel depolariza￾tion and calcium influx, resulting in vasoconstriction. The
increase in oxygen at birth, together with the perinatal
decrease in ETA receptor message, probably contributes
to decreased HPV at birth. However, it is noteworthy that
KCa rather than KV channels may play the depolarizing/
hyperpolarizing role in response to changes in oxygen
tension [27,36]. In addition to reducing HPV, the
increased oxygen tension appears to enhance NO synthe￾sis at birth [15]. A major role for NO in the transitional cir￾culation is further supported by studies [19,32] that
showed that NOS inhibition blunts the oxygen-induced
decrease in PVR at birth.
Although the above paragraphs imply that oxygenation
and ventilation have specific and direct effects on NO and
prostacyclin synthesis, these stimuli, in conjunction with
the recruitment and distension of the pulmonary vascula￾ture by increased left atrial pressure, may act together
through a flow-induced increase in shear stress. In the
postnatal pulmonary circuit, increased shear stress in
response to increased flow is a potent stimulus for
endothelium-derived vasodilator modulator synthesis. This
in turn establishes a positive feedback loop that enhances
PBF until the increase in shear stress due to increased
flow is offset by the decrease in shear stress due to
increased vessel diameter. Distinguishing the role of shear
stress, or indeed the effects of increased synthesis of
other endogenous vasoactive substances (eg adenosine,
bradykinin, etc), from the direct effects of oxygen and ven￾tilatory movements remains an unfinished task.
Changes in pulmonary vascular resistance
during neonatal development
Following the initial acute decrease in PVR at birth, there
is a more gradual decline in resistance over the following
days and weeks. Initially, this decrease in PVR reflects
further recruitment and distension of the vascular bed, and
spreading of the endothelial and vascular smooth muscle
cells [37]. In addition, some studies [38] have identified a
progressive decrease in arterial muscularization during the
first few days of life. These developmental changes lead to
a major decrease in PVR within days of birth [39]. Subse￾quently, lung growth and the increase in intra-alveolar
vessel number lead to a more gradual reduction in PVR
until adult levels are achieved.
During the early newborn period, however, an increase in
PVR due to hypoxia or other pressor stimuli can lead to a
resumption of right-to-left shunting across fetal cardiovas￾cular channels. The resultant profound hypoxemia can
lead to significant morbidity or death if pulmonary vaso￾constriction is not reversed. Fortunately, despite evidence
of increased pulmonary vascular muscularization in young
newborn lungs, HPV appears to be more attenuated in
younger than in older neonates [40–43]. Several factors
may contribute to the neonatal defenses against pul￾monary vasoconstriction. There is some evidence that
hypoxia is not sensed as well by the younger newborn pul￾monary vasculature [42], possibly because of the relative
paucity of KV2.1 channels [27]. Alternatively, the relative
immaturity of neonatal pulmonary vascular smooth muscle
may impair contractility [44]. Finally, there is considerable
evidence that modulators of vasomotor tone attenuate
vasoconstriction more in younger than in older newborns.
Prostacyclin synthesis is enhanced by hypoxia in arteries
from 1- to 2-week-old newborns, but not in arteries from
older newborns [22]. Furthermore, prostacyclin concentra￾tions are higher in the perfusate of hypoxic 1-day-old than
in 1-month-old lamb lungs [42]. In addition, prostaglandins
E1, E2 and D2 cause vasodilatation in hypoxic newborn
lungs, but cause vasoconstriction in older animals [8].
Finally, cyclo-oxygenase inhibition enhances HPV more in
lungs from lambs that are younger than 4 days old than in
those from lambs older than 2 weeks [43]. Whether NO
modulates pulmonary vasomotor tone more in younger
than in older newborns is more controversial. In some
studies of isolated vessels [18,45] endothelium-depen￾dent vasodilatation was greater in arteries from younger
than in those from older animals, whereas in others [46] it
decreased with age. On the other hand, studies of iso￾lated lungs suggest that both endothelium-dependent and
-independent vasodilatation is greater in younger new￾borns [47], and NOS inhibition increased vasoconstriction
more in lungs from younger than in those from older new￾borns [48].
Vasodilator modulators and the pathogenesis
of neonatal pulmonary hypertension
Not only does acute inhibition of vasodilator modulators
increase basal PVR and enhance vascular reactivity in
normal newborn lungs, but also there is evidence that an
imbalance between vasoconstrictor and vasodilator modu￾lators may contribute to the pathogenesis of various forms
of neonatal pulmonary hypertension. The syndrome of per￾sistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) is
characterized by abnormally increased pulmonary vascular
muscularization and severe neonatal pulmonary hyperten￾sion in the absence of other pulmonary or cardiac disease.
Studies conducted during the 1970s and 1980s [49]
found that chronic in utero cyclo-oxygenase inhibition
could result in the anatomic and physiologic features of
Respiratory Research Vol 2 No 3 Ghanayem and Gordon

PPHN. More recently, a study of newborn lambs [50]
showed that in utero infusion of a NOS inhibitor for 10
days mimicked the physiologic, but not the anatomic fea￾tures of PPHN. In addition, chronic fetal ETB receptor inhi￾bition, which results in unopposed ETA-mediated
constriction, led to pulmonary hypertension [51]. Con￾versely, both acute and chronic intrauterine pulmonary
hypertension due to ductal compression led to impaired
endothelium-dependent vasodilatation [52,53] and
reduced KCa channel expression [54]. Chronic hypoxia
during the newborn period also leads to pulmonary hyper￾tension, associated with decreased NOS protein and
message, and impaired endothelium-dependent vasodi￾latation [55,56].
The pathophysiology of PPHN is not only dependent on a
deficiency in the vasodilator modulators, but may also
result from an excess of vasoconstrictor modulators. In
one study of infants with PPHN [57], leukotriene C4 and
leukotriene D4 concentrations were higher than in
neonates without PPHN. Lung thromboxane A2 concentra￾tions were also higher in an ovine model of PPHN than in
control lambs [58]. Finally, serum endothelin-1 concentra￾tions were higher in infants with PPHN [59].
Conclusion
Although modulators of pulmonary vasomotor tone appear
to contribute to elevated fetal pulmonary vasomotor tone,
the decrease in PVR at birth, and the defenses against
pulmonary vasoconstriction during early life, many ques￾tions remain. Is there sufficient redundancy among modu￾lator classes that the loss of one can be compensated for
by an increase in another? Do the reported differences in
modulator activity between arteries and veins mean that all
modulators must be synthesized in order to achieve
normal development [17,60]? What do apparent inter￾species differences in modulator activity imply for the pre￾vention and therapy of neonatal pulmonary hypertension in
humans? Can the loss of modulator activity be identified
and treated in utero? Future studies must address these
and other questions in order to gain a better understand￾ing of the physiology and pathophysiology of pulmonary
vasomotor tone in the fetus and young neonate.
