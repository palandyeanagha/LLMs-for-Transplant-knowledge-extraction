kidney transplant recipients: meta-analysis and meta-regression of
randomised trial data

Abstract
Objective To compare the positive and negative effects of
tacrolimus and ciclosporin as initial treatment for renal
transplant recipients.
Design Systematic review.
Data sources and study selection Reports of comparative
randomised trials of tacrolimus and ciclosporin identified by
searches of Medline, Embase, the Cochrane Register of
Controlled Trials, the Cochrane Renal Group Specialist
Register, and conference proceedings.
Data extraction and synthesis Two reviewers assessed trials for
eligibility and quality and extracted data independently. Data
were synthesised (random effects model) and results expressed
as relative risk (RR), with values < 1 favouring tacrolimus.
Subgroup analysis and meta-regression were used to examine
potential effect modification by differences in trial design and
immunosuppressive co-interventions.
Results 123 reports from 30 trials (4102 patients) were
included. At six months, graft loss was significantly reduced in
tacrolimus treated recipients (RR = 0.56, 95% confidence
interval 0.36 to 0.86), and this effect persisted up to three years.
The relative reduction in graft loss with tacrolimus diminished
with higher concentrations of tacrolimus (P = 0.04) but did not
vary with ciclosporin formulation (P = 0.97) or ciclosporin
concentration (P = 0.38). At one year, tacrolimus treated
patients had less acute rejection (RR = 0.69, 0.60 to 0.79) and
less steroid resistant rejection (RR = 0.49, 0.37 to 0.64) but more
diabetes mellitus requiring insulin (RR = 1.86, 1.11 to 3.09),
tremor, headache, diarrhoea, dyspepsia, and vomiting. The
relative excess of diabetes increased with higher concentrations
of tacrolimus (P = 0.003). Ciclosporin treated recipients had
significantly more constipation and cosmetic side effects. No
differences were seen in infection or malignancy.
Conclusions Treating 100 recipients with tacrolimus instead of
ciclosporin for the first year after transplantation avoids 12
patients having acute rejection and two losing their graft but
causes an extra five patients to develop insulin dependent
diabetes. Optimal drug choice may vary between patients.
Introduction
Renal transplantation is the treatment of choice for most
patients with end stage renal disease. The introduction of
ciclosporin in the early 1980s improved one year graft survival
from 60% to more than 80%.1 2 Tacrolimus emerged as an alter￾native calcineurin inhibitor during the early 1990s.3 Pronounced
global differences in use of tacrolimus exist; 63% of new renal
transplant recipients in the United States receive tacrolimus for
primary immunosuppression compared with only 22% in
Australia.1 2
Despite the impact of calcineurin inhibitors on initial
outcome, longer term graft survival is little changed.1 4 Major
causes of loss are chronic allograft nephropathy and death (most
commonly cardiovascular) with a functioning graft.5 Proved
atherogenic risk factors in the general population (diabetes mel￾litus, dyslipidaemia, and hypertension) are more common in the
renal transplant population.6 To what degree recipient mortality
and graft loss can be attributed to these risk factors, to the direct
toxicity of immunosuppression, or to cumulative effects of infec￾tion and rejection is debated.7 What is known is that tacrolimus
and ciclosporin affect these risk factors differentially. Tacrolimus
is associated more with diabetes and neurotoxicity but less with
hypertension and dyslipidaemia than is ciclosporin, with uncer￾tainty about equivalence of nephrotoxicity or how these relate to
patient and graft survival or affect patients’ compliance and
quality of life.6–8
The objective of this study was to systematically review
randomised controlled trials in which tacrolimus had been com￾pared with ciclosporin as initial immunosuppressive therapy in
the treatment of kidney transplant recipients.
Methods
Inclusion criteria
We included all randomised trials comparing tacrolimus with
ciclosporin solution (Sandimmun) or ciclosporin microemulsion
(Neoral) as initial immunosuppressive therapy, with any
combination of additional immunosuppressive treatments in the
intervention and control arms. We excluded trials in which par￾ticipants received another solid organ in addition to a kidney
transplant (such as kidney with pancreas).
Literature search
We comprehensively searched Medline (1966-October 2003),
Embase (1980-October 2003), Cochrane Collaboration
resources, and conference proceedings. Two reviewers (AW and
RW or RT) independently screened combined search results.
Where we suspected duplicate reporting of the same patient
group, we contacted authors for clarification. If duplication was
confirmed, the first complete publication was the primary data
source, and only this is referenced here. Full details of this proc￾ess and a list of all reports identified, grouped by trial, are avail￾able in the extended Cochrane version of this review.

Outcome measures
Primary outcomes analysed were graft loss (censored for death),
acute rejection, and steroid resistant rejection. Additional
outcomes sought were death, graft loss including death with
functioning allograft, graft function, malignancy, infectious com￾plications, chronic allograft nephropathy, incidence of diabetes
mellitus, and side effects of treatment. Two reviewers (AW and
RW or RT) independently extracted data, using a standardised
form.
Methodological quality of trials
Two reviewers (AW and RW or RT) assessed trials independently.
Quality items examined were concealment of allocation,
blinding, intention to treat analysis, and completeness of follow￾up.
Quantitative data synthesis and data analysis
We extracted data and then used Review Manager 4.2.3
(Cochrane Collaboration) to pool them for summary estimates.
We expressed results for dichotomous outcomes as relative risk,
with values of < 1 favouring tacrolimus, and continuous
outcomes as weighted mean difference, both with 95%
confidence intervals.
We analysed heterogeneity among trials by using a Cochran
Q test and calculating I
2 to measure the proportion of total vari￾ation due to heterogeneity beyond chance.9 We did the analyses
with both random and fixed effects models and found no impor￾tant differences. Results reported here used the random effects
model, as this is more conservative in the presence of heteroge￾neity.10
We did subgroup analyses and meta-regression for the
primary outcomes and for the most commonly reported
complication, diabetes mellitus, to explore important clinical dif￾ferences among trials that might be expected to alter the magni￾tude of treatment effect. Subgroups defined a priori were
publication type, methodological quality of trial, and baseline
immunological risk of the trial population. Additionally, we
assessed publication bias by using funnel plots of the log odds
ratio.11
Meta-regression variables included ciclosporin formulation
(solution or microemulsion), level of exposure to both tacrolimus
and ciclosporin (calculated by using the midpoint of each trial’s
declared intention to treat target ranges at the 12 hour post-dose
nadir, averaged over the first year post-transplantation), the spe￾cific combination of additional baseline immunosuppressive
agents, and the dose of steroids used. We used Stata software to
do meta-regression on the log relative risk scale, with each trial
weighting equal to the inverse of the variance of the estimate for
that study and between study variance estimated with the
restricted maximum likelihood method.
Results
Literature search
We included 123 reports of 30 trials (fig 1)—a total of 4102 ran￾domised participants.12–41 Five of these trials were available in
abstract form only (239 participants), and the remaining 25
(3863 participants) were reported in 18 different journals. Most
of the reports were in English; two reports were in French, and
one was in German.
Included trials
Six trials (1127 participants) compared tacrolimus with the oil
based solution formulation of ciclosporin (Sandimmun), and 19
trials (2744 participants) compared tacrolimus with the
microemulsion formulation (Neoral). We were unable to clarify
which formulation was used for the remaining five trials (231
participants) (table 1).
Most trials were restricted to participants with low baseline
risk for transplantation. Only two trials included participants
with panel reactive antibodies > 50%,21 25 and nine trials included
a proportion (range 10-25%) of participants who had a
previously failed renal transplant.15 24 25 27 29 30 34 36 39 A further trial
was conducted exclusively in children,34 and another included
only African-Americans31; both of these populations are widely
perceived to be at greater risk of rejection and complications.42 43
Additional baseline immunosuppression varied. Three trials var￾ied the antiproliferative agent across three trial arms, investigat￾ing combinations of tacrolimus and ciclosporin with mycophe￾nolate or azathioprine.14 21 38 Azathioprine was used in both
tacrolimus and ciclosporin arms in 16 trials and mycophenolate
in eight trials. One trial used sirolimus,26 one used mirzoribine,20
and one used no antiproliferative agent39; one trial did not state
which was used.32 Seventeen trials reported their corticosteroid
regimen in detail; the remaining 13 trials noted only that “local
protocol” or “a standard reducing schedule” was
followed.12 13 15 17–20 22 23 32 33 35 38
Transplant focused outcomes were reported far more
frequently (for example, acute rejection in 24 trials) than were
complications of immunosuppression (for example, cytomegalo￾virus infection in nine trials) (fig 1). For many adverse events the

measures reported varied widely. Eleven (36%) trials reported
hypercholesterolaemia: three reported the number of partici￾pants with high cholesterol, and the remaining eight reported
the summary average of total cholesterol. Of these eight, two did
not report the standard deviation of these estimates, so data
could not be combined. The remaining six trials reported at five
different time intervals after transplantation, ranging from one
month to three years, making meaningful meta-analysis difficult.
Similar inconsistencies applied to reporting of graft function and
hypertension.
Quality of included trials
Reporting of methods was incomplete for most trials. Four trials
reported adequate allocation concealment,22 24 34 39 two used
inadequate methods,31 36 and the remaining 24 trials were
randomised but gave no indication of the method used. No trials

reported nor deducible for 10 trials12–14 17 23 28 31 32 36 38; it ranged
between 77% and 100% for the remainder.
Outcomes
Transplant focused outcomes
All primary outcomes favoured the use of tacrolimus over
ciclosporin. Graft loss censored for death was reduced in
tacrolimus treated recipients at all time points and reached
statistical significance at six months (graft loss reduced by 44%;
relative risk = 0.56, 95% confidence interval 0.36 to 0.86) and at
three years (29%; 0.71, 0.52 to 0.96) after transplantation (fig 2).

rejection, whether diagnosed clinically or confirmed by biopsy,
beyond thee months after transplantation (table 2). The effect of
tacrolimus in steroid resistant rejection was even more marked,
with 55% reduction at six months (relative risk = 0.45, 0.33 to
0.60) (fig 3).
The only consistently reported measure of graft function
across trials was mean serum creatinine. At six months,
tacrolimus treated patients had a significantly lower mean creati￾nine: 0.14 mg/dl (12.25 mol/l) less than in ciclosporin treated
patients (eight trials, 95% confidence interval − 0.27 to − 0.01
mg/dl), although significant heterogeneity of trial results existed
(P = 0.04, I
2 = 52%) (table 2). Subgrouping trials by clarity of
reporting showed that the heterogeneity was limited to the three
trials in which the number of participants who contributed cre￾atinine measurements was clearly stated (heterogeneity: P = 0.17,
I
2 = 42%), but the source of the variability was unexplained.
These trials also showed a larger mean reduction in creatinine
with tacrolimus ( − 0.47 mg/dl ( − 41.63 mol/l), − 0.81 to − 0.13
mg/dl). In the remaining five trials, the exact number of partici￾pants measured was not directly reported but had to be
calculated or inferred from other data; the summary result
showed less difference in mean creatinine measurements
between treatment groups and across trials (creatinine − 0.05
mg/dl ( − 4.40 mol/l), − 0.13 to 0.03 mg/dl; heterogeneity:
P = 0.89, I
2 = 0%).
Complications and side effects of immunosuppression
A limited number of trials reported the incidence of infection or
malignancy. We found no differences in effect for these
outcomes (table 3).
The most consistent definition used to report disturbance of
glucose metabolism was “new diabetes mellitus,” defined as a
requirement for insulin treatment for ≥ 30 days in previously
non-diabetic patients. The risk of new diabetes at six months, one
year, and three years was significantly increased in tacrolimus
treated recipients (relative risks 2.56, 1.37 to 4.78; 1.86, 1.11 to
3.09; 3.86, 2.01 to 7.41). The results at one year showed
significant heterogeneity (P = 0.01, I
2 = 54.3%), largely owing to
one trial that reported very different rates of new diabetes—9.0%
in the tacrolimus arms compared with 12.9% in the other trials
and 20% in the ciclosporin arm compared with 5.5% in the other
trials.26 Although this difference is not explicable by differences
in methods or trial population, this was the only trial to use
sirolimus as a co-intervention (fig 4). Sensitivity analysis showed
a relative risk of 2.19 (1.42 to 3.38) and much reduced heteroge￾neity (P = 0.18, I
2 = 27.5%) when this trial was removed from the
analysis.
Tacrolimus treated patients were significantly more likely
than ciclosporin treated patients to have tremor, headache, dys￾pepsia, vomiting, diarrhoea, and hypomagnesaemia. Ciclosporin
patients were significantly more likely to have constipation,
hirsutism, and gingival hyperplasia (table 3).
Subgroup analysis and meta-regression
Subgroup analysis on the basis of publication type, methodologi￾cal quality of the trial, and baseline immunological risk of the
trial population showed no evidence of any difference in the
summary estimates for graft loss. However, we found a significant
difference (P = 0.01) for acute rejection dependent on publica￾tion status. Trials published only in non-peer reviewed journals
or abstract form showed no difference between tacrolimus and
ciclosporin (three trials; relative risk 1.02, 0.57 to 1.82), whereas
those published in peer reviewed journals showed a significant
reduction in acute rejection (11 trials; 0.64, 0.57 to 0.72) (table 4).
We were unable to determine whether this difference reflected
publication bias, other reporting bias, or true heterogeneity, as
the funnel plot (not shown) was uninformative and details of
methods were absent for some trials.
When we compared trials conducted exclusively in adult
recipients of primary cadaveric transplants (low immunological
risk) with those containing a proportion of recipients of
subsequent transplants, children, or African-Americans (mixed
and high immunological risk), we found no evidence of any dif￾ference between risk groups (table 4).
Notably, meta-regression showed that higher tacrolimus con￾centrations were associated with an increased risk of graft loss
compared with lower concentrations. This difference remained
significant (P = 0.04) after allowance for differences in
ciclosporin formulation (P = 0.97) and concentration (P = 0.38)
(table 5). Figure 5 shows this relation, which suggests that the
benefit in graft survival is maximal when the tacrolimus concen￾tration is ≤ 10 ng/ml.
The benefit of tacrolimus in reducing acute rejection did not
vary after allowance for tacrolimus concentration (P = 0.77),
ciclosporin formulation (P = 0.99), ciclosporin concentration
(P = 0.14), or different antiproliferative agents (P = 0.98) (table 5).
For patients with new diabetes mellitus, risk did not differ by
antiproliferative agent (P = 0.29) or steroid dose ( ≥ 10 mg/day v
< 10 mg/day at three months; adjusted relative risk 1.36, 0.32 to
5.71; P = 0.27). The increased risk of new diabetes with
tacrolimus compared with ciclosporin was not uniform across all
trials (fig 4) but increased with increasing tacrolimus concentra￾tions (table 5) and seemed to be higher when tacrolimus was
compared with ciclosporin solution rather than microemulsion.
This is a biologically implausible finding and suggests confound￾ing by trial design. Early comparative trials used both ciclosporin
solution and higher tacrolimus concentrations; figure 6
illustrates this relation. When we repeated the analysis to reflect
contemporary practice, restricting it to trials using microemul￾sion ciclosporin, the effect of increasing tacrolimus concentra￾tion remained significant (P = 0.003) after allowance for
differences in antiproliferative agent (P = 0.73), further suggest￾ing that risk of diabetes rises with tacrolimus exposure rather
than ciclosporin formulation. Figure 6 suggests that at a cut-off
point for tacrolimus concentrations of ≤ 10 ng/ml, which
maximises the relative benefit on graft survival, the excess risk of
diabetes can be minimised. Unfortunately, inconsistent reporting
of clinical details across all trials (only 10 trials that reported dia￾betes also reported steroid dosage) prevented the intended more
complex analyses.
Discussion
Summary of key findings
Compared with ciclosporin, treating kidney transplant recipients
with tacrolimus resulted in a substantial improvement in graft
survival—a 44% reduction in graft loss (censored for death)
within the first six months, an effect revealed for the first time by
this meta-analysis and not evident when considering each trial in
isolation. Treating with tacrolimus led to 31% fewer patients hav￾ing acute rejection and 51% fewer having severe rejection that
needed treatment more intensive than steroids, within the first
year.
Evidence from meta-regression suggested that benefit in
graft survival diminished when higher concentrations of
tacrolimus were targeted but was unaltered by differences in
ciclosporin formulation, ciclosporin concentration, or antiprolif￾Papers

insulin and also to have neurological side effects, whereas those
taking ciclosporin had more cosmetic side effects. Risk of diabe￾tes rose when higher concentrations of tacrolimus were targeted.
Strengths and limitations
This systematic review used widely inclusive criteria, to allow
exploration of differences in effect that might arise as a result of
obvious clinical and design differences among the trials and also
to highlight and summarise the totality of randomised trial
evidence available. This approach led to identification of a large
number of trials (30) involving 4102 participants, including
unpublished and non-English language data sources. Confining
a meta-analysis to published or English language data alone has
previously been shown to overestimate positive treatment
effects.44
Adverse effects of treatment were inconsistently reported.
Most trials did not report new cases of diabetes that could be
controlled by diet or oral hypoglycaemic agents; they used high
diagnostic thresholds, recording only those cases that needed
sustained insulin treatment. In addition, often the prevalent cases
rather than incident cases were reported, with no indication of
the numbers of patients with diabetes before transplantation.
Both these aspects introduced bias and are likely to contribute to
the underestimation of the true burden of disturbed glucose
metabolism after transplantation. The value of increasing
available evidence of potential harms associated with interven￾tions has been widely recognised recently.45 46 This review shows
that clearly defined, standardised, consistently used and reported
clinical endpoints, particularly for harms, would greatly enhance
interpretation of trial evidence by clinicians and consumers.47 48
The use of meta-regression to explore sources of
heterogeneity in the meta-analysis was justified, as heterogeneity
tests have low power.49 The relation described by meta-regression
is an observational association across trials and does not have the
benefit of randomisation to underpin interpretation of results.
Hence an association identified with one trial characteristic may
in reality reflect a true association with other correlated charac￾teristics, which may be unknown. The finding that trials that used
ciclosporin microemulsion showed a significantly lower risk of
post-transplantation diabetes than those that used ciclosporin
solution, with no difference in graft loss or acute rejection, may
be an example of such misclassification, and hence our interpre￾tation is guarded. That higher concentrations of tacrolimus
altered the risk of graft loss towards that experienced by patients
on ciclosporin, decreasing the advantage of tacrolimus, we feel is
more biologically plausible, given what is known of the complex
interplay between calcineurin nephrotoxicity, chronic allograft
nephropathy, and infection,50 51 as well as the evidence that
higher doses of calcineurin inhibitors increase progression of
histological markers of graft damage.52 53 Our meta-regression
was limited by available data, so we may have failed to identify
clinically important differences between subgroups that do
exist.54
Clinical implications
On the basis of this analysis, treating 100 recipients at low risk
(such as adult, well matched, first transplants) with tacrolimus
instead of ciclosporin would avoid six cases of acute rejection;
this rises to 17 cases if we consider recipients at high risk (such as
sensitised recipients of subsequent grafts, or children). Tac￾rolimus treatment would avoid one low risk patient but three
high risk patients losing their grafts. In contrast, treating with
tacrolimus would cause an extra five recipients excess harm by
causing them to develop insulin dependent diabetes (table 6).
Evidence from meta-regression suggests that targeting tac￾rolimus concentrations lower than 10 ng/ml will minimise graft
loss and temper the increased risk of diabetes mellitus without
increasing the risk of acute rejection (fig 5 and fig 66
).

One other meta-analysis of four randomised trials compar￾ing tacrolimus with ciclosporin solution was published in 1999,55
and more recently a review examined post-transplant diabetes in
solid organ transplant recipients, including a seven trial
meta-analysis of randomised data for kidney recipients, whereas
we were able to identify 15 trials.56 Our results largely concur with
this previous work and with recent clinical guidelines published
in the United Kingdom,57 although with a larger number of trials
to analyse our estimates have greater precision, and we have
greatly extended the range of outcomes assessed.
Future directions
Our goal was to distil the body of evidence amassed over more
than a decade of large multinational comparative randomised
trials of the two calcineurin inhibitors, to highlight the deficits in
knowledge, and so set the research priorities for the coming dec￾ade. Insufficient information was available to permit formal eco￾nomic analyses, and a general failure to consider global quality of
life for transplant recipients existed. The next step must be to
construct a decision analysis, using this comprehensive summary
of evidence, attaching utilities to the positive and adverse
outcomes associated with each drug. This would provide
clinicians and patients with an algorithm trading off graft
survival against the impact of diabetes and other complications
of immunosuppression, so tailoring the choice of calcineurin
inhibitor to an individual patient’s circumstances.
Conclusions
Tacrolimus is superior to ciclosporin in preventing acute
rejection after kidney transplantation, and we have shown for the
first time that tacrolimus treated patients have improved early
graft survival, although this is at the expense of increased diabe￾tes and neurological and gastrointestinal side effects. In applying
this evidence to patients, the choice of calcineurin inhibitor for
an individual patient is neither automatic nor straightforward, as
risks of benefit and of drawbacks of each treatment must be bal￾anced.

*Results are expressed as the ratio of the relative risk with each potential modifier, compared with the relative risk of the reference category of that confounder. Ratios <1 correspond to a
smaller treatment relative risk for trials with that reference characteristic, so reflecting larger benefit for that characteristic.
†Adjusted ratio for each outcome is for multivariate model containing all explanatory variables that have an adjusted ratio quoted. NA=not available. Insufficient data reported across trials, so
limiting the number of possible confounders that could be controlled for in the multivariate model. Multivariate model limited to those factors felt, a priori, to be of most clinical interest and
have greatest potential to confound the analysis.

*Ciclosporin rates for acute rejection calculated by using summary rate in ciclosporin (control) arms of trials. Trials were grouped by immunological risk of participating population, based on
known associations: age, race, panel reactive antibody level, previous transplantation. These estimates were corroborated with current cohort data (ANZDATA).2 Rates of graft loss and diabetes
were derived from the summary rates of these outcomes in the ciclosporin (control) arms of trials reported at one year. Tacrolimus rate calculated on basis of overall relative risks of 0.69 for
acute rejection, 0.77 for death censored graft loss, and 1.86 for new onset diabetes mellitus requiring insulin for ≥30 days, all at one year after transplantation.
†Calculated as absolute risk reduction or increase.
What is already known on this topic
Both tacrolimus and ciclosporin improve graft survival, but
tacrolimus reduces acute rejection in kidney transplant
recipients more than ciclosporin does
Tacrolimus is associated with more diabetes and
neurotoxicity but less hypertension, dyslipidaemia, and
cosmetic side effects than ciclosporin
What this study adds
Tacrolimus improves graft survival compared with
ciclosporin, with a 44% reduction in graft loss (censored for
death) within six months after transplantation
Tacrolimus doubles risk of new diabetes mellitus requiring
insulin compared with ciclosporin
Graft survival is maximised and risk of diabetes minimised
when tacrolimus target concentrations are < 10 ng/ml over
the first year after transplantation.
