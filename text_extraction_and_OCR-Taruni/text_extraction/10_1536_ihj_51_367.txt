Summary
We report a case who had confirmed tumor cells in the biopsy specimens by transvenous endomyocardial biopsy 
with intra-procedural consultation and fast smear cytology. A 57-year-old female was admitted to our hospital because of 
shortness of breath and left back pain. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) and contrast-enhanced computed tomog￾raphy (CT) scans demonstrated a large mass in the right atrium and multiple liver tumors thought to be due to spread of 
the disease. Coronary angiography showed the right coronary artery was involved in the mass. In order to confirm the 
histological diagnosis, we attempted transvenous endomyocardial tumor biopsy under fluoroscopic guidance. However, 
we failed to obtain adequate tissue material. Due to several risks associated with a surgical procedure such as an open 
surgical biopsy, transvenous endomyocardial tumor biopsy was again attempted with the aid of transesophageal echocar￾diography (TEE). Intra-procedural consultation and fast smear cytology enabled us to finish the procedure. Hematoxylin￾eosin stained sections demonstrated spindle-shaped cells. Immunohistochemical stains of these cells were positive for 
anti-factor VIII antigen, CD31, and CD34. These findings indicated a definite diagnosis of angiosarcoma. Since there 
was no surgical indication for this tumor, the patient underwent chemotherapy with docetaxel and radiotherapy. Three 
months later, CT scans showed a reduction in the size of the cardiac tumor. (Int Heart J 2010; 51: 367-369)

Primary cardiac tumors are extremely rare and difficult to 
diagnose. A final diagnosis depends on histopathologi￾cal confirmation. At the time of discovery, up to 75% 
have systemic metastases1) and the effect of surgical resection 
is only temporary,2) and hence the prognosis is relatively poor. 
A pathological diagnosis with cardiac biopsy is established an￾temorten in only 50% of patients.3) The specimen material is 
usually obtained by open biopsy or surgical resection. There 
have been reports of transvenous biopsy for cardiac tumors un￾der transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) guidance,4-7) al￾though sometimes specimen material is not successfully ob￾tained.8)
Case Report
A 57-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital be￾cause of shortness of breath and left back pain. She had been 
healthy previously without recent chest pain or pyrexia, and 
she denied any exposure to vinyl chloride. On physical exami￾nation, her heart rate was 94/minute, blood pressure was 90/54 
mmHg, and SpO2 was 98% with a 10 L/minute O2. Jugular 
vein dilatation and hepatomegaly were detected. Neither heart 
murmur nor lung rales were detected. The electrocardiogram 
showed sinus tachycardia (94 beats/minute), low voltage in 
limb leads, and a QS pattern in V1 and V2 leads. Chest X-rays 
revealed cardiomegaly and bilateral pleural effusion. Transtho￾racic echocardiography (TTE) showed reasonable left ven￾tricular systolic function, massive pericardial effusion with 
right ventricular collapse in early diastolic phase, and a mass in 
the right atrium. Pericardiocentesis was performed and the re￾sultant bloody pericardial effusion showed no cytological evi￾dence of malignancy (class II). Testing for tuberculosis or other 
bacterial agents was negative. After pericardiocentesis, her 
blood pressure elevated immediately. Contrast-enhanced com￾puted tomography (CT) scans demonstrated a large mass in the 
right atrium; maximum diameter of the lesion was 50 mm. 
Coronary angiography showed that the right coronary artery 
was involved in the mass and supplied numerous vessels feed￾ing the tumor (Figure 1). CT scans of the abdomen showed 
multiple liver tumors thought to be due to the spread of the dis￾ease. In order to confirm the histological diagnosis, we then at￾tempted transvenous endomyocardial tumor biopsy under 
fluoroscopic guidance. However, the specimen obtained was 
mainly fibrous tissue, thus we failed to obtain adequate tissue 
material. As the next step, we considered an open surgical bi￾From the Departments of 1

opsy. Since there were several risks associated with a surgical 
procedure, we chose a less invasive method. In the next week, 
with the aid of TEE, transvenous endomyocardial biopsy was 
again attempted. The TEE indicated that the biopsy forceps 
(bioptome) was positioned on the tumor (Figure 2), and several 
specimens were obtained. Intra-procedural consultation and 
fast smear cytology enabled us to finish the procedure. There 
were no complications during the procedure. The hematoxylin￾eosin stained sections demonstrated spindle-shaped tumor cells 
that formed irregular vascular channels (Figure 3). The tumor 
showed strong mitotic activity. Immunohistochemical stains of 
these cells were positive for CD31, CD34 (Figure 4), and anti￾factor VIII antigen indicating that the tumor cells were derived 
from the endothelium. Together, these findings indicated a de￾finitive diagnosis of angiosarcoma. We discussed the fact that 
there was no surgical indication for this case, because metas￾tases to the other internal organs were found and total excision 
of the cardiac tumor was anatomically impossible. We there￾fore selected non-surgical treatments. The patient underwent 4 
weekly cycles of chemotherapy with docetaxel at 75 mg/m2
per cycle (3 weeks of treatment, 1 week of rest) and standard 
fractionated radiotherapy at a total dose of 61.2 Gy was given 
in 34 fractions. Her condition improved with the findings of 
resolution of the pericardial effusion, reduction in cardiac tu￾mor size, and inhibition of growth of the liver tumors. Three 
months after these multidisciplinary approaches, a CT scan 
showed a reduction in the size of the cardiac tumor.
Discussion
A clinical diagnosis of cardiac angiosarcoma is difficult 
because the symptoms of this disease are varied. Clinical 
symptoms include (a) tumor mass effects that obstruct intra￾cardiac blood flow or interfere with valve function, (b) arrhyth￾mias or pericardial effusion with tamponade, (c) tumor embo￾lism, and (d) systemic or constitutional symptoms.9) Systemic 
symptoms only, such as weight loss, fever, night sweats, and

chills occur in approximately 10% of these patients in the ab￾sence of cardiac symptoms.10) These nonspecific symptoms, 
the rarity of the disease, and its rapid progression, with tumor 
metastases to multiple organs, are responsible for the late diag￾nosis and poor prognosis. Therefore, it is important to make a 
diagnosis at early stages of the disease. If surgical resection is 
impossible, only tumor biopsy allows us to obtain diagnostic 
tissue. Although thoracotomy can also be attempted, endomyo￾cardial biopsy is a safe procedure that can be easily performed 
to obtain tissue with less morbidity and mortality, particularly 
in patients at high operative risk. Often tumors are so large at 
the time of operation that complete resection cannot be per￾formed. Endomyocardial biopsy is therefore the last resort in 
considering an invasive technique. Formerly, the technique 
usually was performed under fluoroscopic guidance to obtain 
biopsy samples.11) However, using fluoroscopic guidance limits 
the sites in the myocardium from which samples can be ob￾tained (usually the right ventricular septum).7) Recently TEE￾guided transvenous endomyocardial biopsy has been used to 
diagnose primary cardiac angiosarcoma.6) Additionally, in a 
statement on the role of endomyocardial biopsy in the manage￾ment of cardiovascular disease from the American Heart Asso￾ciation, the American College of Cardiology, and the European 
Society of Cardiology, guidance with TEE is advised when 
possible.12)
In our patient, transvenous endomyocardial biopsy was 
less invasive than open biopsy or surgical resection. Using 
fluoroscopic guidance, we failed to harvest tumor cells. This is 
believed to be a reason that the tumor did not exist in the right 
ventricular septum. We discussed the fact that a second biopsy 
under TEE guidance would be less invasive than open biopsy. 
Therefore, we selected transvenous endomyocardial biopsy 
under TEE guidance. TEE provided excellent visualization of 
both the mass and the bioptome and was very useful for ob￾taining diagnostic tissue samples. To determine whether an ad￾equate sample had been obtained from the tumor, we consulted 
the pathology laboratory during the procedure. Fast smear cy￾tology revealed that the samples consisted of malignant cells.
In the present report, the immediate diagnosis allowed us 
to undertake active treatments such as chemotherapy and radi￾ation. Surgical resection is not always an effective treatment 
for cardiac tumors because of the large mass of cardiac tissue 
involved, furthermore, it sometimes leads finally to exploratory 
thoracotomy. This makes it highly important to establish a 
more noninvasive diagnostic tool for cardiac tumors. TEE is 
useful in determining tumor size, anatomical localization, and 
valvular abnormalities and has a diagnostic sensitivity of 97% 
for non-myxomatous cardiac tumors.13) Definitive diagnosis of 
cardiac tumors depends on pathological, rather than morpho￾logical findings. Transvenous endomyocardial biopsy has sev￾eral advantages over traditional open incisional biopsy. These 
include significantly less risk of morbidity and mortality, and 
ease of learning and performance by most physicians. Further￾more, we confirmed the presence of tumor cells in the speci￾mens obtained by transvenous endomyocardial biopsy, by 
means of intra-procedural consultation and fast smear cytolo￾gy. Surgeons often call upon surgical pathologists for intra-op￾erative consultation on diagnosis and assessment of margins of 
resection,14) however, there are no reports of cardiologists call￾ing upon pathologists for consultation regarding confirmation 
of tumor cells in the diagnosis of biopsy specimens. Therefore, 
not only transvenous endomyocardial biopsy with the aid of 
TEE, but also intra-procedural consultation, should be taken 
into consideration when trying to diagnose the histopathology 
of cardiac tumors.
