The syndrome of portapulmonary hypertension is
well recognised but the cause of the association is
obscure. We describe the history of a 24-year-old
man who developed this syndrome, and in whom
the findings at necropsy included the hitherto
unreported association of adenomatous hyperplasia
of the liver.
Case report
A 24-year-old Indian man died in 1977 after a long
illness that began in 1961 (aged 8 years) with a
severe gastrointestinal haemorrhage. Laparotomy
showed large oesophageal varices that were over￾sewn. The spleen was enlarged but the liver looked
normal. After a further gastrointestinal bleed in
1966 he underwent splenic venography, which
showed a small, poorly opacifying portal vein and
extensive oesophageal varices. Splenectomy and
lienorenal anastomosis were performed. Chest
radiography was normal.
He remained well until 1972 when he developed
pneumonia. Cardiac catheterisation at this time
showed a mean pulmonary arterial pressure of
64 mmHg, a mean wedge pressure of 5 mmHg,
and a pulmonary vascular resistance of
826 dyne s cm-5. Pulmonary angiography showed
aneurysmal dilatation of the pulmonary trunk and
pruning of the peripheral vessels but no sign of
thromboembolism. Hepatic wedge pressure was
3 mmHg. Results of spirometry, liver function
tests, and a liver biopsy were normal. He was
treated with anticoagulants but his exercise
tolerance gradually decreased, and in 1976 he
developed signs of right heart failure from which
he died in July 1977.
PATHOLOGICAL FINDINGS
Post-mortem examination showed gross right
ventricular and right atrial hypertrophy. Total
heart weight was 502 g, right ventricle 290 g, left
ventricle and septum 121 g (ratio L: R 0-41), atria
91 g. The cardiac valves were structurally normal,
and there were no septal defects. Histological ex￾amination of the right ventricular myocardium
showed hypertrophy of the muscle fibres with box￾like nuclei. The pulmonary trunk was greatly
dilated and showed extensive areas of cystic medial
degeneration in which there were small tears, in￾dicative of early dissection. Histologically, the
media had a "moth-eaten" appearance with num￾erous areas where the elastic lamina had been lost,
being replaced by acid mucopolysaccharide. There
was severe intimal fibrosis.
The elastic pulmonary arteries were thick and
atheromatous. The muscular pulmonary arteries
(those between 100 and 1000 ,um in diameter)
were dilated and many were occluded by intimal
fibroelastosis of "onion-skin" type. Their media
appeared thinned, distended, and infiltrated by
intimal fibroelastic tissue. Many branches were
extremely thin and dilated, and clustered around
parent vessels (fig 1) or in the lung parenchyma.
Some branches contained plexiform arrangements
of cells which appeared to have arisen either from
the intima or in continuity with cellular com￾ponents of the media. Such appearances constitute

"plexiform lesions" of some maturity, indicative
of long-standing severe pulmonary hypertension.
There was no evidence of pulmonary throm￾boembolism, veno-occlusive disease, or porta￾pulmonary venous anastomoses.
The liver was small (956 g) and on section
showed a pronounced nutmeg pattern of centri￾lobular venous congestion with multiple, sharply￾defined white areas of adenomatous hyperplasia
(fig 2). There was no evidence of cirrhosis. A
patent portal vein could not be found; sections
through the porta hepatis showed cavernomatous
transformation. The site of the lienorenal shunt
was found to be occluded, and numerous varices
were present.

Discussion
A moderate degree of pulmonary hypertension is
common in patients with portal hypertension due
to cirrhosis, but those patients described by Segel
et al (1963) had raised pulmonary wedge pressures
and normal pulmonary vascular resistances, indi￾cating that their pulmonary hypertension was
passive, probably secondary to a high cardiac
output.
Severe pulmonary hypertension of the order
found in our patient is distinctly uncommon, and
although found predominantly in patients with
cirrhosis may be seen in extrahepatic portal hyper￾tension (Naeye, 1960). In our patient liver function
was normal when pulmonary hypertension was
diagnosed, and deteriorated only when he de￾veloped progressive right heart failure.
Pathologically the type of pulmonary vascular
disease that occurs in association with portal
hypertension is characterised by plexiform lesions
of the muscular pulmonary arteries and, in some
cases, necrotising arteritis ("plexogenic pulmonary
arteriopathy"). The mechanism by which these
changes arise is obscure. This form of vascular
disease is also seen in patients with "primary"
pulmonary hypertension and in some with con￾genital cardiac shunts. Intrapulmonary arterio￾venous anastomoses and portapulmonary venous
anastomoses occur in patients with liver disease
(Harris and Heath, 1977), and hypertension may
possibly develop as a result of increased blood
flow via these channels. No such anastomoses
were, however, found in our patient.
Naeye (1960) found emboli in the small pul￾monary arteries in five of his cases and regarded
these as the cause of the pulmonary hypertension.
We believe they were superimposed on pre￾existing vascular damage since the histological
features of plexogenic pulmonary arteriopathy are
quite distinct from those of recurrent pulmonary
thromboembolism (Harris and Heath, 1977). Our
patient showed no evidence of thromboembolism.
A humoral mechanism for the development of
pulmonary hypertension is an attractive alterna￾tive. It is well established that some substances￾for instance fulvine-affect both the liver and the
pulmonary vasculature. When fulvine is admin￾istered to rats those that survive acute hepatic
necrosis develop hypertensive pulmonary vascular
disease (Kay et al, 1971), probably as a result of
passage to the pulmonary circulation of a meta￾bolite of fulvine. In cirrhosis and portal hyper￾tension dietary metabolites or vasoactive com￾pounds normally removed by the liver may
possibly find their way to the lungs. The nodules
of adenomatous hyperplasia found in our patient
may also not be as innocent as is generally thought
(Klemperer, 1928). Whether such nodules could
secrete a vasoactive substance that causes pul￾monary vasoconstriction and whether a similar
mechanism could occur in certain patients with
cirrhosis are possibilities that might be worth
exploring in the future.
Electron microscopic appearances of the pul￾monary lesions will be discribed in a subsequent
paper.
