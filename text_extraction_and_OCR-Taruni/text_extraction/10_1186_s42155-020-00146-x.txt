Abstract
In the management of patients with postoperative lymphatic fistula (LF) in different locations, iodized oil-based
lymphangiography (LAG) from trans-pedal or intranodal route is an established diagnostic approach with the potential
to plan further interventional treatments. However, specific lymphatic interventions are indicated depending on
different locations and morphologies of the LF. After a systematic literature review, four types of interventions can be
considered, including direct leakage embolization/sclerotherapy (DLE/DLS), percutaneous afferent lymphatic vessel
embolization (ALVE), percutaneous afferent lymphatic vessels disruption/sclerotherapy (ALVD/ALVS), and trans-afferent
nodal embolization (TNE). In the iodized oil-based LAG, three potential lymphatic targets including confined leakage,
definite afferent LVs, and definite closest afferent LNs should be comprehensively assessed. For optimal prospective
treatment planning for LF, iodized oil-based post-lymphangiographic computed tomography (post-LAG CT) is a useful
complement to the conventional iodized oil-based LAG, which can be performed easily after LAG. This review article
summarized the current evidence of the specific lymphatic interventions in patients with postoperative LF and
explored the potential benefits of post-LAG CT in the intervention planning from a case series.

Background
Postoperative lymphatic fistula (LF) is a severe complica￾tion after thoracic, abdominal, or pelvic surgeries result￾ing in high mortality (Itkin et al. 2009; Baek et al. 2016a;
Baek et al. 2016b; Nadolski et al. 2018). The clinical
diagnosis of LF is usually based on the detection of
milky fluid leakage with triglyceride > 110 mg/dl and/or
positive detection of the chylomicron (Xu et al. 2011;
Liu et al. 2014). In addition, iodized oil-based conven￾tional lymphangiography (LAG) is an established diag￾nostic approach, in which the iodized oil such as lipiodol
as a contrast medium is injected from the trans-pedal or
intranodal route to visualize the lymphatic system and
ruptured lymphatic vessels (LVs) (Cope and Kaiser 2002;
Hur et al. 2016; Yannes et al. 2017; Reisenauer et al.
2018; Chu et al. 2019). Recently, the intranodal approach
has been more recommended which is characterized by
shorter examination time and easier handling compared

with trans-pedal LAG (Nadolski and Itkin 2012;
Nadolski et al. 2018).
Although there are other useful diagnostic
techniques such as nuclear medicine lymphoscinti￾graphy and gadolinium-based magnetic resonance￾lymphangiography (MRL) being able to visualize the
lymphatic system and LF as well, conventional io￾dized oil-based LAG was considered as the gold
standard of reference for the prospective intervention
planning for LF at different locations (Pui and Yueh
1998; Pieper et al. 2019; Pieper et al. 2020). How￾ever, the 2-dimensional feature of conventional io￾dized oil-based LAG can sometimes make it difficult
to determine the exact anatomical information of the
lymphatic system due to the overlapping structures
(Ginat et al. 2009; Itkin et al. 2009; Kortes et al.
2014). Thus, post-lymphangiographic computed tom￾ography (post-LAG CT) is recommended which can
be carried out easily after iodized oil-based LAG, to
illustrate better anatomical details of the lymphatic
system and LF with three-dimensional spatial reso￾lution (Ginat et al. 2009; Kawasaki et al. 2013;
Kortes et al. 2014) (Fig. 1). In this review, it summa￾rized the current evidence of the specific lymphatic
interventions in patients with postoperative LF at
different locations and explored the potential bene￾fits of post-LAG CT in the intervention planning
from a case series.
Radiological demonstrations of the LF
Above all, understanding the different radiological
demonstrations of the LF is very important for pro￾spective intervention planning. Equally, in either io￾dized oil-based LAG or post-LAG CT, the
postoperative LF is directly characterized by the vi￾sualized iodized oil extravasation out from the affer￾ent LVs (Fig. 2a-b), or the ectopic presence of the
iodized oil in the tissue space, such as peritoneal
space or pleural space without definite leaking point
(Fig. 2c) (Kawasaki et al. 2013; Yoshimatsu et al.
2013). From one study, the LF with iodized oil ex￾travasation detected by both LAG and post-LAG CT
(major LF) showed a worse response to treatment
than is recognized using post-LAG CT only (minor
LF) (Kawasaki et al. 2013). In terms of radiological
morphology, local pooling extravasation of LF (Fig.
2a) demonstrated in the post-LAG CT indicated a
better prognosis than the diffused extravasation of
LF (Fig. 2b) (Yoshimatsu et al. 2013). Noticeably, the
typical iodized oil extravasation showed a higher
density with a pronounced laser beam artifact than
the normal LNs.
Except for the direct LF demonstrations, other in￾direct demonstrations of LF should also be noted,
including iodized oil or methylene blue detected in
the drainage reservoir, the disruption of main lymph￾atic ducts, and abnormal lymphatic collateralization
and distribution (e.g. abnormal distribution of io￾dized oil at the lung parenchyma or mesenterium,
abnormal dilated LVs, lymphatic reflux, etc.), indicat￾ing the dysfunctional LVs or potential LF after the
surgery (Fig. 2d-f) (Kos et al. 2007; Savla et al.
2017). The surgery can disrupt the main lymphatic
ducts, leading to central lymphatic flow disorder
(CLFD) which demonstrates as the backflow of the
lymph or abnormal lymphatic collateralization (Fig.
2d-e) (Savla et al. 2017). It is speculated that the oc￾clusion of the central lymphatic duct induced a pro￾nouncedly increased lymphatic pressure, leading to
the continuous permeation of the lymph, instead of

postoperative LF in the right groin after endovascular artery repair
for an infrarenal abdominal aneurysm through the right femoral
artery route. In the iodized oil-based LAG procedure, a total of 15 ml
of lipiodol was injected with a velocity of 1 ml/min. However, due to
the slow outflow of the lipiodol, 20 min after the accomplishment of
the injection, the lipiodol only went up to the middle third of the
thigh (black arrowhead) under the fluoroscopy and no obvious
extravasation was found (a). 4 h later, the post-LAG CT was
sequentially performed. The coronal (b) and sagittal (c) MIP images
show definite extravasation of lipiodol (white arrowhead) at the
right thigh with at least two points. The 3D-VR image (d) clearly
visualized the major flowing route of the lymphatic fluid from calf to
groin (white arrow) and the LF points (white arrowhead). Besides,
abnormal lymphatic collateralization in calf could be observed (d).

the direct rupture of the lymphatic duct. As a result,
in clinical practice, patients with CLFD mostly have
a worse response to the interventions (Savla et al.
2017). In addition, thoracic surgeries might result in
pulmonary lymphatic perfusion syndrome (PLPS), in
which the iodized oil from the thoracic duct directly
flowed toward the lung parenchyma through abnor￾mal pulmonary lymphatic networks (Savla et al.
2017) (Fig. 2f). It was probably ascribed to the devel￾opment of plastic bronchitis along with the long
duration of the chylothorax (Dori et al. 2016; Savla
et al. 2017).
Methods of systematic retrieve
A systematic literature review was performed in
order to define eligibility criteria for further lymph￾atic interventions for LF after iodized oil-based
LAG in accordance with the PRISMA statement
(Liberati et al. 2009). The PubMed database was
retrieved for previously published studies on inter￾ventional treatments for traumatic or iatrogenic
lymphatic leakage based on the radiological demon￾strations of iodized oil-based LAG from 05/13/1999
to 05/13/2019 (Lee et al. 2014). Due to similar an￾terior LAG techniques between the trans-pedal and
intranodal routes, both of these two iodized oil￾based LAG techniques were included in the review.
The search strategy is described in the Electronic
Supplement 1. Additional studies were identified
through a reference check. The original articles,
case series, and brief reports specifically aiming at
technique description and clinical outcomes with
case number ≥ 5 were included in the review. Stud￾ies were selected for inclusion by two of the au￾thors (FP and CMS) and the decisions were made
in consensus by all authors.
A summary of specific lymphatic interventions for LF at
different locations based on the prior iodized oil-based
LAG
The details of the database retrieval are shown in
Fig. 3. Finally, 18 published articles are involved
(Table 1). According to the involved articles, multiple
specific lymphatic interventions were developed based
on the iodized oil-based LAG. Post-LAG CT was per￾formed as a complement to LAG in only one article,
which was used to identify an appropriate puncture
site for further intervention (Kortes et al. 2014). Al￾though different names were given to these interven￾tions in the studies without unification, percutaneous

embolization and disruption were the two main ap￾proaches. In summary, four major types of interven￾tional treatments could be considered, including
direct leakage embolization/sclerotherapy (DLE/DLS),
percutaneous afferent lymphatic vessel embolization
(ALVE), percutaneous afferent lymphatic vessels dis￾ruption/sclerotherapy (ALVD/ALVS), and trans￾afferent nodal embolization (TNE) (Cope and Kaiser
2002; Boffa et al. 2008; Chen and Itkin 2011; Kortes
et al. 2014; Baek et al. 2016a; Baek et al. 2016b; Hur
et al. 2016; Kim et al. 2019). In most of the previ￾ously published studies, these four major types of
therapeutical lymphatic interventions for LF were per￾formed under classic fluoroscopy guidance (Table 1).
However, in some studies, the CT and sonography
guidance as complements to fluoroscopy guidance
started to be used in the embolization and sclerother￾apy, in order to reduce the ectopic injury and moni￾tor the procedure-related complications, especially for
the deep LF (Kortes et al. 2014; Hur et al. 2016;
Yannes et al. 2017; Yildirim et al. 2018; Kim et al.
2019). In the following parts, these interventions were
explicitly introduced:
Direct leakage embolization/sclerotherapy (DLE/DLS)
In the DLE/DLS procedures, the lymphopseudoaneur￾ysm or lymphocele (defined as a small or large con￾fined lymphatic fluid collection extravasated from the
ruptured LVs which was contained by the surround￾ing tissue) was directly targeted. The glue (e.g. a mix￾ture of N-butyl cyanoacrylate (NBCA) and lipiodol)
or the sclerosant (e.g. povidone-iodine, ethanol, talc,
bleomycin, tetracycline, etc.) was directly injected to
fill and/or flush this pooling extravasation in order to
prevent continuous discharge from the LF (Hur et al.
2016; Chu et al. 2019). The advantage of this type of
intervention could be used in any confined LF at dif￾ferent locations, such as thoracic, abdominal and pel￾vic LF, and other locations as well, as long as the LF
is identified as being confined by the surrounding tis￾sue. The potential ectopic damage to the surrounding
tissue such as chemical peritonitis should be consid￾ered when performing DLS (Kortes et al. 2014; Kim
et al. 2019). In such a case, DLE might be a better
choice if that is possible. Compared with DLS, DLE
showed about twice better clinical efficiency (88.9%
versus 43.8%) (Yildirim et al. 2018, Kim et al. 2019).

But for the large lymphocele, the injection of sclero￾sants via the percutaneous drainage tube is another
option to seal the ruptured lymphatic channels when
the DLE is impossible (Chu et al. 2019).
Because the puncture difficulty of the DLE/DLS
procedure is relatively low, the technical success rate
is almost 100%. However, the clinical success rate
varied from 40% to 100%, commonly with a recur￾rence rate of 20–25% (Nadolski et al. 2018; Yildirim
et al. 2018; Chu et al. 2019; Kim et al. 2019). This
could potentially be assigned to the incapability of
destroying or occluding leakage sites by using the sin￾gle DLE or DLS (Shih et al. 2008; Kim et al. 2019).
Thus, multiple DLE/DLS treatments can be also con￾sidered to increase the cure rate (Chu et al. 2019).
Percutaneous afferent lymphatic vessel embolization (ALVE)
In the ALVE procedures, the upstream afferent LV of
the LF was targeted, which was mainly used in the treat￾ment of chylothorax (Table 1). It is believed at
ALVE has better efficiency than the DLE/DLS due to
more reliable occlusion of the leakage site (Baek
et al., 2016a, b). Two embolization techniques can
be used in this method. First, the embolized agent,
such as glue, is directly injected through the needle
after the puncture (Baek et al., 2016a, b; Hur et al.
2016). In this technique, the coil is not recom￾mended. Second, the micro-catheterization is per￾formed before embolization. This technique is always
used in the thoracic duct owing to the long distance
between the puncture site (always cisterna chyli) to
the leakage site, which is also called the thoracic
duct embolization (TDE) (Cope and Kaiser 2002;
Boffa et al. 2008). In TDE procedure, glue [e.g. a
mixture of N-butyl cyanoacrylate (NBCA) and lipio￾dol] and/or coils was/were used to embolize the
thoracic duct after the successful micro￾catheterization approaching the leakage site. How￾ever, the puncture difficulty in ALVE is higher than
the DLE/DLS with longer examination time, hence
the modified ALVE technique was reported once, in
that the needle penetrated both anterior and poster￾ior walls of the afferent LV followed by injection of
the glue simultaneously with the needle withdrawal
(Baek et al. 2016a). This technique allowed the glue
consolidated around and in the target LV resulting
in the “cutting-off” inflow of lymphatic fluid to the
leakage site (a so-called “cutting-off” embolization).
It was suggested as a more feasible technique with
an equal efficiency (Baek et al. 2016b).
From the published articles, the technical success
of trans-needle embolization is probably higher than
trans-microcatheter embolization. In two small-scale
published studies, the technical success rate of trans￾needle embolization was reported to be 100% with a
clinical success rate of 75–85% (Baek et al. 2016a;
Baek et al. 2016b). But in trans-microcatheter
embolization, the technical success rate of 37.5–
100.0% with the clinical success rate of 84.6–100.0%
was reported (Cope and Kaiser 2002; Boffa et al.
2008; Itkin et al. 2009; Yannes et al. 2017; Majdalany
et al. 2018). Therefore, the trans-microcatheter tech￾nique probably has better clinical efficiency and is
recommended if technically feasible. However, LF
with multiple afferent LVs is observed which is
probably difficult to treat by using trans￾microcatheter embolization, the trans-needle
embolization can be chosen to embolize each affer￾ent LV (Baek et al. 2016a). As it is similar to DLE/
DLS treatment, ALVE can also be used in definite
LF at different locations, such as thoracic, abdom￾inal, and pelvic LF, etc., as long as there is the iden￾tification of accessible afferent LVs.
Percutaneous afferent lymphatic vessels disruption/
sclerotherapy (ALVD/ALVS)
ALVD can be used to treat LF after the failure of
ALVE (Cope and Kaiser 2002; Boffa et al. 2008; Itkin
et al. 2010; Chen and Itkin 2011; Yannes et al. 2017;
Majdalany et al. 2018; Nadolski and Itkin 2018). Fur￾thermore, the afferent LV is the target of the inter￾vention. According to the published studies, two
disruption techniques were reported: mechanical
needle disruption which was only reported in chy￾lothorax (thoracic duct disruption, TDD) and disrup￾tion by application of sclerosant (afferent lymphatic
vessel sclerotherapy, ALVS) (Cope and Kaiser 2002;
Boffa et al. 2008; Itkin et al. 2010; Chen and Itkin
2011; Kortes et al. 2014; Yannes et al. 2017; Majda￾lany et al. 2018; Nadolski and Itkin 2018). In the
TDD, the 21- or 22-gauge needles disrupted the tar￾get LVs by repeated needle punctures, probing,
twisting, or to-and-fro “twiddling” motions (Cope
and Kaiser 2002; Chen and Itkin 2011). Following
the “blinded” destruction of the LV, the technical
success rate of 100% was reported, but the clinical
success rate varied from 0% to 100% (Cope and Kai￾ser 2002; Boffa et al. 2008; Itkin et al. 2010; Yannes
et al. 2017; Majdalany et al. 2018; Nadolski and Itkin
2018). In fact, the difficulty for a complete destruc￾tion of the culprit LV remains. But in the ALVS,
after the needle was advanced as close as possible to
the target upstream afferent LVs, a small amount of
contrast agent was injected to simulate the potential
distribution following sclerosant injection under the
CT guidance, which visualized the sclerotized region
(Kortes et al. 2014). According to one published
study, the technical success rate of ALVS was
Pan et al. CVIR Endovascular (2020) 3:79 Page 7 of 15

reported to be 100% with the clinical success rate of
77.8% (Kortes et al. 2014). Thus, sclerosant disrup￾tion probably has better efficiency than the mechan￾ical needle disruption. Besides, when the needle is in
position and the contrast is injected, the simulated
sclerotized region can be clearly visualized under the
CT guidance, which avoided ectopic destruction to
important tissue or organs (Kortes et al. 2014). Thus,
ALVS showed higher safety than mechanical needle
disruption. Moreover, the ALVS can also be used in
defined LF at different locations (Kortes et al. 2014).
Trans-afferent nodal embolization (TNE)
In the TNE procedures, the closest upstream affer￾ent lymph node (LN) is punctured as the target
structure. It is considered as a better alternative to
ALVE in order to treat LF with multiple afferent
LVs (Baek et al. 2016a). To ensure efficiency, the
LN should be close to the leakage site, and thus
achieving an embolization from the afferent LV to
the leakage site (Hur et al. 2016; Kim et al. 2019).
So far, the maximal distance between the target LN
and the leakage site has not been recommended, as
well as the optimal choice of the mixture ratio of
NBCA and lipiodol. However, the ratio of the mix￾ture of NBCA and lipiodol ranging from 1:2–1:9
can be flexibly chosen based on the status of the
glue flow towards the leakage site (Chu et al. 2019;
Kim et al. 2019). Due to the most common cause
of treatment failure of multiple leakage sites, mul￾tiple afferent LNs should be embolized simultan￾eously, achieving larger treatment areas to prevent
the leakage from the small or non-visible collateral
branches in the actual clinical practice (Chu et al.
2019, Kim et al. 2019). From the published articles,
the technical success rate was reported as 100%
with the clinical success rate of more than 80%
(Smolock et al. 2018; Chu et al. 2019; Kim et al.
2019). This method is feasible in the treatment of
LF at abdominal, pelvic, inguinal, and lower extrem￾ities locations. But in the chylothorax, the distance
between afferent LN and leakage of the thoracic
duct is relatively long, hence TNE is not recom￾mended. If the interventional radiologist finds a
premature polymerization of the glue mixture be￾fore reaching the leak point or infeasible access of
the afferent LNs, the TNE should not be continued
or started, and other interventions should be con￾sidered such as the DLE/DLS (Chu et al. 2019).
Dedicated treatment planning of specific lymphatic
interventions from iodized oil-based LAG
In summary, the basic indications and operations of the
four major types of interventions were summarized in
Table 2. As a result, three potential lymphatic targets
were the major objectives for these feasible interven￾tions, including confined leakage, definite afferent LVs,
and definite closest afferent LNs (Fig. 4). In the iodized￾Table 2 The four major types of therapeutical interventions based on the iodized oil-based LAG
Interventions Basic indications Introductions of the procedure
DLE/DLS (Hur et al. 2016, Kim et al. 2019) Identification of confined extravasation
from the LVs contained by the
surrounding tissue, which could also
be called “lymphopseudoaneurysm”
or lymphocele.
The confined extravasation was punctured by
using a 21- or 22-gauge needle, or with a
drainage catheter. Then, the glue or the
sclerosant solution was injected to completely
fill and/or flush the confined extravasation.
ALVE (Cope and Kaiser 2002, Boffa et al. 2008,
Baek et al. 2016a, Baek et al. 2016b)
Identification of the direct upstream
and accessible LV that directly
extravasated.
The upstream LV of the LF was directly
puncture by using a 21- or 22-gauge needle.
Then, the embolized agents (eg. glue, particles,
coils, etc.) were injected through the needle
or advanced microcatheter to completely
embolize the target LV close to the leakage site.
ALVD/ALVS (Cope and Kaiser 2002, Chen
and Itkin 2011, Kortes et al. 2014)
Identification of the direct upstream
LV that directly extravasated, but the
target upstream vessel, that was
accessible for the embolization, was
very small or multi-branched. In
addition, the surrounding area was
not close to important blood vessels
or nerves.
The 21- or 22-gauge needle was advanced as
close as possible to the target upstream LVs.
Then, repeated probing or injection of the
sclerosant solution occurred to destroy the
target LVs.
TNE (Hur et al. 2016, Kim et al. 2019) Identification of the site of the contrast
extravasation and the closest upstream
LN from which efferent LV extravasated
a short distance away.
The closest upstream LNs of the LF were
punctured by using 21- or 22-gauge needle,
and then glue was injected along with the
lymphatic flow to embolize the leakage at
the end.

Ethanol as the sclerosant was injected to flush the lymphocele and then this was drawn out twice. Eight (8) days after DLS, the CT scan revealed
very limited residual lymphatic fluid (e, f). Abbreviations: DLS – direct leakage sclerotherapy; post-LAG CT – post-lymphangiographic computed

oil based LAG, it is essential to comprehensively assess
the lymphatic system and these potential targets in order
to plan the optimal or feasible interventions.
However, the iodized-oil based LAG can’t provide
enough anatomical details of the lymphatic system, espe￾cially the surrounding soft tissues. Compared with iodized
oil-based LAG, it was reported that post-LAG CT could
not only be used to delineate the lymphatic flow and as￾sess the site of LF as well, but also provide the anatomical
details of the surrounding tissues (Figs. 1 and 2) (Ginat
et al. 2009; Kortes et al. 2014; Lee et al. 2014). Besides,
post-LAG CT has a higher sensitivity to detect the LF and
leakage site with a 3-dimensional visualization compared
with conventional iodized oil-based LAG (64.3%–76.9%
vs. 46.2%–62.5%) (Deso et al. 2012; Kawasaki et al. 2013;
Yoshimatsu et al. 2013).
Although it is still lack of enough clinical data of
the post-LAG CT in the intervention planning for LF,
a few case reports or small-scale studies indicated
that post-LAG CT had the potential to become a use￾ful complement to LAG in the treatment planning,
such as choosing an appropriate puncture route to
minimize procedure-related complications and illus￾trate the morphology of LF (confined or not) to iden￾tify the feasibility of DLE or DLS treatment (Ginat
et al. 2009; Itkin et al. 2009; Kortes et al. 2014).
Thus, post-LAG CT allows a more accurate assess￾ment of LF, with the capability for further planning
of interventional treatment modalities, which previ￾ously had only referred to conventional iodized oil￾based LAG.
Technique description of post-LAG CT
The techniques of the trans-pedal and intranodal io￾dized oil-based LAG are already well described in
several publications in the literature (Nadolski and
Itkin 2012; Kortes et al. 2014; Lee et al. 2014). How￾ever, according to our knowledge, no standard tech￾nical recommendation of post-LAG CT has been
published, yet. But, in either iodized oil-based LAG
(trans-pedal or intranodal) or post-LAG CT, the im￾ages of both the filling phase (opacification of the
target LVs and LNs until contrast runoff toward the
venous angle) and nodal phase (24 h after the initial
procedure) should be documented (Kos et al. 2007;
Deso et al. 2012). To improve the examination effi￾cacy and to reduce the radiation exposure, the CT
could be performed just after the contrast has
reached, or is above the LF level identified by fluor￾oscopy (Kortes et al. 2014). Empirically, the adequate
timing of fluoroscopy and post-LAG CT was
mandatory, such as immediately/1–3 h/4–6 h after
accomplishing trans-pedal injection of iodized oil in
the lower extremity and groin/pelvis and abdomen/
thorax and neck (Kortes et al. 2014, Lee et al. 2014).
If there was a main lymphatic vessel obliteration or
surgical ligation, the inspection timing of fluoroscopy
and post-LAG CT should be appropriately prolonged
to ensure the inspection of the iodized oil extravasa￾tion (Fig. 1). Nevertheless, delayed post-LAG CT ac￾quisition in the nodal phase might have diminished
anatomical details of the LVs as the contrast agent
had been drained out from the LVs although the io￾dized oil extravasation still could be detected (Dong
et al. 2018).
Regarding the set-up of the CT acquisition parame￾ters, it could be performed using the standard non￾contrasted scanning protocol according to the differ￾ent body parts (e.g. 120 kVp with adapted tube
current for thorax). The reconstruction of slice thick￾ness and increment was mostly set up as 1 or 2 mm
for better spatial resolution (Ginat et al. 2009; Safar
et al. 2011; Yamada et al. 2017; Zhang et al. 2017).

orientations and 3-dimensional volume rendering

Note: Conventional iodized oil-based LAG showed the definite
extravasation from three afferent LVs into the drainage (a). A similar
demonstration was observed from the sagittal MIP images of post￾LAG CT (b). The clear afferent LVs are shown (white arrowheads).
The afferent LVs were punctured using the 21-G needles under the
CT guidance penetrating the anterior and posterior walls (c). After

(3D-VR) images could facilitate to visualize the whole
lymphatic vessels and LF (Fig. 1) (Ginat et al. 2009;
Yamada et al. 2017). As an alternative to a conven￾tional CT scan, a simultaneous cone-beam CT scan
can also be used, which could be performed with
fluoroscopy simultaneously (Yildirim et al. 2018).
Examples of the utility of post-LAG CT in planning
intervention and treatment
Case 1 (DLS procedure)
A patient was diagnosed with a terminal renal insuf￾ficient injury caused by IgA nephropathy (Berger’s
disease). After the allograft renal transplantation, a
progressive lymphocele surrounding the transplanted
kidney occurred. The conventional trans-pedal LAG
was performed and 9 ml lipiodol was injected, with a
subsequent post-LAG CT acquisition after 5 h. CT
images showed clear extravasation of lipiodol from
the iliac lymphatic ducts into the lymphocele. How￾ever, multiple and filiform afferent vessels were de￾tected and hence, the ALVS and ALVE were not
possible. In addition, three afferent LNs could be
considered as potential targets, but the closest LN
was located dorsally of the kidney which is an obs￾tacle for puncture. Thus, the TNE was not optimal
either. Eight days later, due to a lack of improve￾ment of the lymphocele, DLS was performed. In the
procedure, a pigtail drainage catheter was inserted
into the lymphocele. After the drainage of lymphatic
fluid, 15 ml of 95% Ethanol as a sclerosant was
injected to flush the lymphocele twice. The drainage
amount was monitored and ceased after 1 week.
Eight days after the procedure, the CT scan revealed
very limited residual lymphatic fluid, hence the
drainage catheter was removed. The details are
shown in Fig. 5.
Case 2 (ALVE procedure)
In a patient after femoral lifting surgery, persistent LF
at the right thigh occurred with the lymph output of
400 ml per day. Thus, the iodized oil-based LAG was
performed and 16 ml of lipiodol was injected. One
hour later, a sequential post-LAG CT scan was per￾formed. The conspicuous extravasation of the lipiodol
from multiple LVs draining into the drainage catheter
was observed in both of the iodized oil-based LAG
and post-LAG CT. One day later, the ALVE was per￾formed. After localization of the target afferent LVs
from the visualization of the residual lipiodol with the
assistance of the previous post-LAG CT images, the
Fig. 7 A patient underwent ALVS procedure after post-LAG CT. Note: After the surgery, the right chylothorax appeared with hyperdensity of the
right lower lung in the chest radiogram (a). The coronal MIP images of post-LAG CT demonstrated a definite rupture (white arrowhead) of the
thoracic duct (white arrows) and the extravasation to the right pleural cavity (b). The axial MIP image demonstrated a clear rupture of the
thoracic duct (c). The lower thoracic duct was regarded as the target afferent LV for the ALVS and a 21-G Chiba needle was used to puncture
close to the lower thoracic duct (d). Afterwards, 1 ml contrast followed with 4.0 ml 95% Ethanol being injected. The post-ALVS CT scan showed
an ideal distribution of the sclerosant around the target thoracic duct (e). Eleven (11) days after ALVS, the chest radiogram shows no obvious
recurrence of the chylothorax (f). Abbreviations: ALVS – afferent lymphatic vessel sclerotherapy; post-LAG CT – post-lymphangiographic
computed tomography; MIP – maximum intensity projection; LV – lymphatic vessel

optimal figure was achieved with four-needle puncture
under CT guidance. Afterwards, a total of 11 ml his￾toacryl/lipiodol mixture (2:3) was injected into the
LVs using the “cutting-off” technique mentioned
above. After the ALVE, the LF ceased immediately
and no recurrence was found in the follow-up. The
details are shown in Fig. 6.
Case 3 (ALVS procedure)
A patient was diagnosed with erosive esophagitis￾induced esophageal stenosis confirmed by endoscopic
biopsy, hence thoracic-abdominal esophagus resection
with gastric tube-esophagus anastomosis was per￾formed. After the surgery, the right chylothorax ap￾peared with the average daily output of 1130 ml from
the two thoracic drainage catheters. Due to the non￾effective conservative treatment, conventional trans￾pedal LAG was performed and 15.0 ml iodized oil was
injected. Eight (8) hours later, the post-LAG CT scan
was performed, showing a definite rupture of the
thoracic duct with the extravasation to the right
pleural cavity. From the post-LAG CT images, the
distal cisterna chyli could be regarded as the target
afferent LV for the ALVE treatment, or the distal
thoracic duct could be regarded as the target afferent
LV for the ALVS treatment. Eventually, the ALVS
was chosen to be performed, since it is an easier
technique. After the sclerotherapy by using 95% Etha￾nol, the pleural effusion drainage gradually reduced
and finally ceased after 8 days. No recurrence was ob￾served in the follow-up. The details are shown in
Fig. 7.
Case 4 (TNE procedure)
A patient was diagnosed with endometrial carcinoma
after undergoing laparoscopically-assisted vaginal
hysterectomy with adnexectomy. After the surgery,
the LF appeared with the demonstration of extensive
lymphatic fluid in the pelvis. Thus, the conventional
trans-pedal LAG and sequential post-LAG CT were
performed. A total of 16 ml of lipiodol was applied.
Diffused extravasation with multiple afferent LVs
and LNs were shown. From the three axial CT im￾ages, the multi-afferent LNs were clearly defined.
Owing to the multiple and filiform afferent LVs and
diffused LF, the TNE was the only choice. One
month after the iodized oil-based LAG, the LF per￾sisted. Hence, the TNE was eventually carried out.
Under the CT guidance with the visualization of the
target afferent LNs by the residual lipiodol, seven af￾ferent LNs were successfully punctured. After verifi￾cation of the correct needle position, sequential
embolization with histoacryl/lipiodol mixture (1:1)
was carried out with a total volume of 11 ml. After
the TNE, the LF ceased and the pelvic lymphatic
fluid disappeared after 1 week. In the follow-up, no
recurrent LF was observed again. The details are
shown in Fig. 8.
Case 5 (no intervention treatment)
A patient was diagnosed with thyroid carcinoma while
undergoing thyroidectomy. After the surgery, the per￾sistent LF from the wound and drainage catheter oc￾curred. Thus, the conventional trans-pedal LAG was
performed with the injection of the 19 ml lipiodol,
followed by the sequential post-LAG CT scan 2 h
later. Both the iodized oil-based LAG and post-LAG
CT images showed the typical rupture of the thoracic
duct near the jugular angle with the accumulation of
the lymphatic fluid in the left neck. In addition, the
post-LAG CT images implied the disruption of the
thoracic duct with the reflux of the lipiodol to the
left upper arm. Since in this patient the main cisterna
chyli and thoracic duct were very small and tortuous
with multiple collaterals, it is difficult to perform
Fig. 8 A patient underwent a TNE procedure after post-LAG CT.
Note: The conventional iodized oil-based LAG shows the obvious
extravasation (white arrowhead) from multiple afferent LVs and LNs
in the right pelvis (a). One (1) hour later, the post-LAG CT (b) was
sequentially performed which shows similar findings (white
arrowhead) and identifies seven definite afferent LNs (*). The TNE
was carried out with a CT-controlled percutaneous puncture of
seven afferent LNs (c). After the embolization with the histoacryl/
lipiodol mixture (1:1), the optimal distribution of the histoacryl/
lipiodol mixture in afferent LNs and LVs is observed (d).

either the AVLE or the TDE. Further, with the ALVS
it is impossible to destroy all the afferent LVs. Thus,
no further intervention was carried out. However,
with the therapeutical effect of the iodized oil-based
LAG, the LF gradually reduced after the procedure
and ceased on the 11th day. No recurrence was found
in the follow-up. The details are shown in Fig. 9.
In this case, LAG demonstrated a good therapeutical ef￾fect for LF, except for diagnostic usage. From the previous
studies, iodized oil-based LAG could cure the LF with the
efficacy rate of 50–70%, because iodized oil is also a classic
embolized agent being capable of occluding the ruptured
LVs (Matsumoto et al. 2009; Alejandre-Lafont et al. 2011;
Kawasaki et al. 2013; Kortes et al. 2014; Hur et al. 2016;
Yannes et al. 2017; Nadolski et al. 2018; Miyayama 2019).
However, from the systematic review in this study, only one
study involved 5 patients who underwent delayed interven￾tion after ineffective LAG treatment, while the other 6 pa￾tients were cured with the single LAG treatment (Kortes
et al. 2014). Hence, it is still questionable to estimate the
real efficacy of the different intervention for postoperative
LF while excluding the influence of iodized oil-based LAG
from published articles. In prospect, it is worthwhile to ex￾plore which strategy is better: simultaneous iodized-oil
LAG with sequential intervention, or iodized oil-based
LAG with delayed intervention if the LF persists after LAG.
In this case, it indicated that delayed intervention after
ineffective iodized oil-based LAG might be a better choice
with a higher cost-efficiency to treat the postoperative LF.
Conclusions
Four major types of the interventions can be considered
for postoperative LF at different locations, including direct
leakage embolization/sclerotherapy (DLE/DLS), percutan￾eous afferent lymphatic vessel embolization (ALVE),
percutaneous afferent lymphatic vessels disruption/sclero￾therapy (ALVD/ALVS), and trans-afferent nodal
embolization (TNE). Three potential lymphatic targets
should be comprehensively assessed in prior iodized oil￾based LAG, including confined leakage, definite afferent
LVs, and definite closest afferent LNs. In addition, post￾CT LAG is probably a useful complementary modality for
dedicated treatment planning of interventions for postop￾erative LF meriting further exploration.

arm was observed which indicates the disruption of the end of the thoracic duct (b). In the axial post-LAG CT image, the fluid accumulation with
the iodized oil extravasation is noticed (c). No other intervention was carried out in this patient except for the conventional iodized oil-based LAG
treatment. However, with time (6d, 11d) (d-e), the fluid accumulation gradually reduced and the drainage eventually ceased on the 11th day.
