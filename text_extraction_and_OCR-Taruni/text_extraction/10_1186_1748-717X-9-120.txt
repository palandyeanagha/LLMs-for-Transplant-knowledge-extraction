Abstract
Background and aim: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of Cyberknife stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT)
and its effect on survival in patients with unresectable huge hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) unsuitable of other
standard treatment option.
Methods: Between 2009 and 2011, 22 patients with unresectable huge HCC (≧10 cm) were treated with SBRT.
dose ranged from 26 Gy to 40 Gy in five fractions. Overall survival (OS) and disease-progression free survival (DPFS)
were determined by Kaplan-Meier analysis. Tumor response and toxicities were also assessed.
Results: After a median follow-up of 11.5 month (range 2–46 months). The objective response rate was achieved
in 86.3% (complete response (CR): 22.7% and partial response (PR): 63.6%). The 1-yr. local control rate was 55.56%.
The 1-year OS was 50% and median survival was 11 months (range 2–46 months). In univariate analysis, Child-Pugh
stage (p = 0.0056) and SBRT dose (p = 0.0017) were significant factors for survival. However, in multivariate analysis,
SBRT dose (p = 0.0072) was the most significant factor, while Child-Pugh stage of borderline significance. (p = 0.0514).
Acute toxicities were mild and well tolerated.
Conclusion: This study showed that SBRT can be delivered safely to huge HCC and achieved a substantial tumor
regression and survival. The results suggest this technique should be considered a salvage treatment. However, local
and regional recurrence remain the major cause of failure. Further studies of combination of SBRT and other treatment
modalities may be reasonable.

Introduction
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most
common malignancy worldwide, and the leading cause
of cancer death in South and East Asia. In small HCC,
hepatic resection and other nonsurgical treatment modal￾ities have contributed to good survival [1,2]. However,
treatment for huge HCC (≧ 10 cm in diameter) remain a
challenge. At present, hepatic resection is regarded as the
most available treatment of choice, provided the patient’s
hepatic function reserved is acceptable for resection [3-7].
For unresectable huge HCC, TACE is an alternative, but
the response rates are generally poor for large tumors
[8,9]. After failure of TACE or patients unsuitable for
TACE due to co-existing morbidities such as portal vein
thrombosis or other vascular extension, no standard treat￾ment is available, and various clinical trial have been tried,
but to date survival benefits have been limited. And with￾out any treatment these patient will not survive more than
3 months [10].
With the recent advancement of radiation therapy tech￾nology, Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) has proven
its efficacy in the treatment of liver tumors. In the majority
of recent studies, SBRT has been shown to achieve a high
rate of local control with low toxicity in particular for small
or ≦5 cm tumor [11-13]. But limited information is avail￾able regarding the use of SBRT for treatment of huge unre￾sectable HCC. With the help of internal markers (fiducials)
and synchrony tracking of tumor during respiration. SBRT

more accurate application by reducing the error margin
with reducing the amount of normal tissue exposure dur￾ing treatment, enhancing the chance of treating larger
tumor with limited normal liver available or tumor in close
proximity to critical organs [14-17]. Furthermore, fraction￾ated SBRT may have 3 times the biological effect of
conventional fractionated radiation therapy [18,19].
This study retrospectively analyzed the outcomes of 22
patients with unresectable huge HCC with no other
treatment options but with good liver function reserve
and acceptable performance status treated with Cyberknife
(Accuray Inc., Sunnyvale, CA) SBRT. We also attempt to
determine survival, toxicity and response after SBRT. And
hope these data would provide new hope to these patients
who would otherwise be abandoned in terms of thera￾peutic options.
Methods and materials
Patients
Between January 2009 to November 2011, 22 patients with
unresectable huge (≥10 cm) hepatocellular carcinoma
(HCC) not suitable for other standard treatments were
treated at out center with Cyberknife SBRT. Patient in￾cluded in our study was based on the following criteria (1)
Pathological confirmation of HCC; (2) At least one radio￾logical image with the classic HCC feature of enhance￾ment accompany by a level of serum tumor marker alpha
fetoprotein (AFP) of >200 ng/ml or at least 2 radiological
image (CT/MRI/Angiogram) with the classic imaging
finding of HCC; (3) longest tumor diameter of ≥ 10 cm;
(4) an ECOG performance status of ≤ 2. All patients with
multiple extrahepatic metastases, Child-Pugh C, intract￾able ascites, tumor closely attached to esophagus, stom￾ach, duodenum and bowel, normal liver volume of less
than 700 cc were excluded from treatment.
Mandatory baseline examinations include dynamic mag￾netic resonance imaging (MRI) and or 3-phase computed
tomography (CT) of liver, complete blood study, liver func￾tion test, hepatitis B, C antigen and virus titers, alpha￾fetoprotein (AFP), and chest images were arranged. Patient
with HbsAg positive or elevated hepatitis B virus titer was
given prophylactic anti-retroviral therapy from the start of
SBRT to at least 6 months after treatment in prevention of
post-RT reactivation of HBV [20,21].
The characteristics and disease variables of the 22
patients at the time of radiation treatment are summarized
in Table 1. The age ranges from 45–91 with a median age
of 71, and male predominant. Tumors were mostly loca￾ted in the right lobe. The mean maximum tumor diameter
was 11.36 cm (range 10–18 cm) and solitary type tumor
was the most frequent type.
The advantages and disadvantages of cyberknife SBRT
were explained to the patients, and the final treatment
depended on patients’ decisions. Written informed consent

was obtained from all patients before treatment, and the
study was approved by the institutional review board of
Chi Mei Medical Center.
SBRT
SBRT was performed using the Cyberknife, a robotic
image-guided whole body radiosurgical system, equipped
with the synchrony system, a real-time respiratory track￾ing system for target volumes that move with respiration.
The total accuracy is less than 1.5 mm with Synchrony for
mobile targets, with a treatment accuracy of 0.3 mm [22]
4 gold fiducial markers were implanted percutaneously
around the perimeter of the target volume using a sono￾guided procedure 5–7 days before the acquisition of the
CT-scan used for planning. Thin-slice CT scan and MRI
were performed with a slice thickness of 1 mm and trans￾ferred to the Cyberknife planning system. The contouring
was performed on the planning CT with contrast. While
the hepatic phase or delay phase of MRI was fuse with the
planning CT-scan for contouring, other phases of MRI
were also used as a visual reference. The PTV and organs
at risk were delineated on the CT scan, and the system
automatically performed an optimization of beam direc￾tions and beam weight in order to maximize the dose
delivered to the target, minimizing the dose delivered to
the organs at risk. All patients were positioned on indi￾vidually shaped vacuum pillows and wore a treatment
jacket on which the optical markers were fixed. Any dis￾placement of the patient during treatment was detected
by either internal or external fiducial markers with sub￾millimeter accuracy [22].
Dose specification and plan evaluation
Prescribed doses, doses per fraction and number of
fractions were individualized based upon tumor size,
location, amount of normal liver available and organ at
risk. SBRT doses range from 26 Gy to 40 Gy in 5 frac￾tions, with 40 Gy as the predominant prescribed dose,
found in 16 patients. The gross tumor volume (GTV)
included contrast-enhancing disease visible on CT scan
or MRI with contrast. No CTV was further added. The
GTV was directly expanded 1–3 mm in all direction
to create the planning target volume (PTV). Modifica￾tion of PTV was done if it extended into the dose￾limiting organs, except the normal liver. Radiation doses
were prescribed to the isodose line ranging from
59.9-96.9% of the maximum dose, median isodose line
was 79.93%. Treatment was delivered with the real-time
tracking system using the fiducial as a guide, planning
with MultiPlan Cyberknife Treatment Planning System
version 2.10.
The protocol dose constraints for normal liver (total
liver minus cumulative GTV) specified that a minimum
volume of 700 ml should receive a total dose less than
15 Gy [23], 66.7% of Ipsilateral right kidney volume should
be less than 15 Gy, The maximum total dose to any point
in the spinal cord should not exceed 18 Gy, and stomach,
bowel, duodenum, heart should not exceed 30 Gy, while
the esophagus should not be more than 27 Gy [24]. Efforts
were made to minimize the dose to all normal tissues as
low as possible.
Follow-up, response, and toxicity assessment
After completion of treatment, the vital status evalu￾ation, physical examination, liver function test, Complete
blood test were followed to assess acute toxicity. They
were followed every 1–2 weeks in the first months and
every 3 months thereafter. Image study with 4-phase
CT-scan or dynamic MRI of liver and AFP were followed
1–2 months and subsequently every 3- to 4-months. Tox￾icity grading was according to Common Toxicity Criteria
Adverse Events version 4.0. Acute toxicities were defined
as adverse events occurring within 3 months after SBRT,
and late toxicities were those occurring after 3 months.
Radiation-induced liver disease was defined as either clas￾sic or nonclassic RILD. Classic RILD was the presence of
nonmalignant ascites and anicteric elevation of alkaline
phosphatase level twice the upper normal level or baseline
value occurring between 2 weeks and 3 months after
the completion of irradiation. Nonclassic RILD, typic￾ally occurring between 1 week and 3 months after ther￾apy, involves elevation of transaminase to at least 5 times
the upper limit of the normal or pretreatment level
within 4 months irradiation completion or decline in
liver function in the absence of classic RILD [25-27].
This endpoint was common in HCC patients of poor
liver function (hepatitis B infection, Child-Pugh Classic B
and C) The diagnosis of both RILD could be made
only in the absence of evidence of tumor progression.
Toxicity grading was recorded based on the worst toxicity
recorded.
Tumor response was assessed as described in the Re￾sponse Evaluation and Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)
after completion of SBRT. A complete disappearance
of the tumor was defined as complete response (CR),
a decrease of more than 30% of the longest diameter
of target tumor as partial response (PR), a decrease of
less than 30% of the longest diameter of target tumor
or no change as stable (SD), and progression of target
tumor size of more than 20% as progressive disease
(PD). Local recurrence was defined as an increase in
tumor size or the development of a new lesion within
the PTV. Regional recurrence was defined as the develop￾ment of new lesion in non-targeted liver or outside the
PTV. Distant metastasis was defined as recurrence beyond
the liver, Disease progression was defined as the develop￾ment of local recurrence, regional recurrence and distant
metastasis.

Statistical analysis
The Overall survival rate (OSR) and Disease-Progression
free survival (DPFS) were estimated from the commence￾ment of SBRT to the last follow-up using the Kaplan￾Meier method. Univariate hazard ratio (HR) and 95%
confidence interval were estimated by Cox propor￾tional hazards regression model. Significant factors in
univariate analysis were applied to the Multivariate Cox
porportional hazard regression analysis. Analysis of data
was performed using SPSS (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA)
version 17 software. And the statistical significant level
was set to p value <0.05.
Results
Tumor response and local control
The tumor response was based on the change in the max￾imum tumor size on serial CT-scans or MRI 4–8 weeks
after completion of treatment and 2- to 3- months there￾after. After a median follow-up of 11.5 month (range 2–46
mo.), an objective response was achieved in 19 patients
(86.3%), with complete response in 5 patients (22.7%), par￾tial response in 14 patients (63.6%), and stable disease in 3
patients (13.6%) (Table 2). The 6 months local control rate
was achieved in 11 patients (61.11%); 1-yr. local control
rate in 10 patients (55.56%), and patients with a score of
Child-Pugh A and those receiving dose of at least 40 Gy
achieving a local control rate of 66.67% and 71.43%, re￾spectively. While none was seen in Child-Pugh B patients
and patient receiving dose of < 40 Gy. However, local
recurrence and regional recurrence remain high, local re￾currence rate at 6 months and 1-yr. were noted in 7 pa￾tients (38.89%) and 8 patients (44.45%), respectively. While
regional recurrence was noted in 10 patients (47.62%) at
6 months and 11 patients at 1-yr. (53.31%) (Figure 1).
Survival
The median follow-up was 11.5 months after the start of
SBRT. At the time of analysis, 11 patients had died and
another 11 remained alive. The 6-months and 1-year OS
was 81.8% and 50%, respectively, and median survival
was 11 months (range 2–46 months) while 1-year disease
progression-free survival rate was 31.8% and median time
to disease progression was 6 months (range 2–46 months)
(Figure 2). The 1-yr local control rate and regional control
rate were 55.56% and 45%. And 1-yr. Overall survival rate
for local control and regional control were 71.4% and
66.7%, respectively.
The analyses of the prognostic factors were based on
survival calculations from the start of SBRT. In univariate
analysis, Child-Pugh stage and SBRT dose were found to
be significant prognostic factors for survival (Table 3).
However, multivariate analysis showed that the SBRT dose
was the most significant factor, while Child-Pugh stage
was of borderline significance (Table 4).
Toxicity
Toxicity was summarized in Table 5. No grade 4 or 5
toxicity occurred. In term of acute toxicities, Grade 1
fatigue and grade 1–2 thrombocytopenia were the most
common sequelae, in 91% and 67% of the patients, res￾pectively. 1 patient had grade 3 elevation of SGPT and 1
with grade 2 elevation of alkaline phospatase, but both
were documented with regional and local recurrence. 4 pa￾tients have grade 1 elevation of alkaline phospatase, 1 was
documented with regional recurrence and bone metastasis,
3 were mild elevation from the upper limit of less than 2
fold, Others liver function alterations were usually mild
ranging from grade 1 to 2. The effects were transient and
stabilized within 1–2 weeks. All patients completed SBRT
without interruption due to intolerable side effect. For￾tunately, no patients suffer from severe RILD nor death
related to treatment. Grade 1–2 rib pain and local skin
induration of right lateral abdominal wall were in 5 and 3
patients, respectively. No Gastrointestinal toxicity such as
gastroduodenal ulcer, gastroenteritis nor colitis were noted.
Since most of the treated tumors (21) were located in the
right lobe of the liver, dose to bowel and stomach were
minimal, and the 1 patient treated in the left lobe, strict
dose constraint to the bowel and GI tract. were adhered.
While for patients with huge HCC tumor closely adher￾ence to the ribs, inorder not to compromise tumor cover￾age, rib volume was not constraint. Nonetheless,
neither rib fracture nor skin ulceration was observed.
Discussion
During the past decade, a number of reports have docu￾mented the effect of SBRT on HCC. There remain no
optimal dose and fractionation scheme, but the current
consensus stated high dose local RT alone or combine
with other modalities such as TACE could achieve a high
rate of local control [28-30] However, these reports were
mostly limited to smaller tumors or tumor less than
10 cm [31-36]. For Huge HCC, it remain a challenging
role for radiation therapy, because of close proximity to
critical organ, limited liver volume available and a rela￾tively poor liver functional status. At present there are
only scarce studies on this issue. In our study, our pre￾liminary results support the fact that SBRT could be an
alternative treatment for unresectable huge HCC with
no other treatment option. 1-yr OS of 50% is comparable
to that of TACE for tumor >5 cm [3,31]. At present, TACE

was the most common alternative treatment for inoperable
large HCC. Although long-term survival has been reported
after TACE, but reported tumor response is achieved in
only 17–61% and complete response is rare because of
viable tumor cells remain after TACE [8]. After failure of
TACE, other treatment options such as target therapy, hep￾atic intraarterial chemotherapy were unsatisfactory for
large HCC. And thus, our present study resulted in a
1-yr. objective response rate of 86.3% (CR, 22.7% and
PR, 63.6%). 1-yr. local control rate of 55.56% (Child￾Pugh A 66.67%, Child-Pugh B 0%; Radiation dose
40 Gy 71.43%, dose <40 Gy 0%) and a median sur￾vival of 11 months (range 2–46 months) were encour￾aging. Accordingly, we view Cyberknife SBRT as one
of the best alternative treatment modality for inoperable
huge HCC patient particular for Child-Pugh A patients
and those tolerating a radiation dose of at least 40 Gy.
Our present trial was too small to allow stratification by
prognostic factors, however, exploratory multivariate ana￾lysis showed that a higher radiation dose (40Gy/5 frac￾tions) independently predicted overall survival. Several
studies have shown a dose–response relationship between

conventional radiation therapy dose and response in
HCC. And higher more intense SBRT dose contribute to
higher local control rates [32-36]. Seo et al. [35] prospect￾ively studied 38 patients with inoperable HCC (<10 cm)
treated by Cyberknife SBRT, radiation doses range from
33–57 Gy in three to four fractions were prescribed ac￾cording to tumor volumes. The local response rate was
63% at 3 months after SBRT. And two-year overall sur￾vival and local progression-free survival rates were 61.4%
and 66.4%., a high radiation dose was found as the inde￾pendent prognostic factor. While Rusthoven et al. [36], In
a phase II study, using 60 Gy in three fractions, resulted in
an actuarial in-field local control rate for liver metastasis
(< 6 cm) at 1 and 2-yrs after SBRT were 95% and 92%, re￾spectively. Moreover, for maximal diameter of 3 cm or
less, 2-yr. Local control rate was 100% and only one case
of grade 3 soft tissue toxicity was observed. Hence, high￾dose liver SBRT was safe and effective when normal liver
tissue constraint was met. Chang et al. [37], recently stud￾ied SBRT for colorectal liver metastases in 3 major institu￾tions. The study demonstrates that local control is dose
dependent, with a 18-month local control of 84% for
total doses ≥ 42 Gy versus 43% for total doses <42 Gy.
Overall, the total dose, dose per fraction and biological ef￾fective dose were significant in univariate and multivari￾ate analysis. Nevertheless, it must be reminded that
most HCC usually associated with liver cirrhosis and
poor liver functions was more susceptible to liver tox￾icity rather than liver metastasis. In our present study, we
strictly specified that a minimum volume of 700 cc of
normal liver should receive a total dose less than 15 Gy.
Compared with other Radiation therapy technique,
Cyberknife SBRT with respiratory synchrony tracking
system demonstrated its advantage in treating huge HCC
with a limited normal liver preserved. These systems are
demonstrably more conformal and able to minimize radi￾ation outside the PTV, thus sparing critical structures near
the tumor than those generated by other system. This also
delivered higher biological effective doses without

increasing incidence of liver toxicity incidences, and
attained a higher local control rate.
In our present study, other than transient hepatic function
disorders and gastrointestinal toxicities commonly observed.
Neither grade 3 complications nor radiation-induced liver
disease (RILD) were observed. There were 5 patient suffered
from Grade 1–2 painful musculoskeletal complication, not￾ably right lower rib pain and skin induration, all these pa￾tients have huge HCC closely adherent to adjacent ribs and
skin. In order not to compromise the PTV coverage, rib and
skin constraints were not considered, but fortunately, no se￾vere complication above grade 2 was observed. Although
musculoskeletal complications were not life-threatening
event,these morbidity should be considered in treating huge
HCC with high SBRT dose. In the recent multicenter ana￾lysis by Benedict et al. [24] reported SBRT doses in 5 frac￾tions, the maximum point dose of 43 Gy (8 Gy/fx) on rib
volume should be less than 1 cc. And less than 10 cc of skin
volume should not receive more than a max point dose of
39.5 Gy (7.9 Gy/fx). In another study by Dunlap et al. [38],
recommended Chest wall volume receiving 30 Gy in three
or five fractions should be limited to <30 cc. to reduce tox￾icity without compromising tumor coverage.
Huge HCC have shown to harbor microvessel tumor inva￾sion, poor differentiation, a propensity for multinodular le￾sions and subsequent recurrence. A Recurrence rate of
more than 70% after resection of very large HCC (>10 cm)
was reported by Shah et al. [8]. In our study, regional and
local recurrences remain the major pattern of failure. Thus,
combining SBRT with other treatment modality with non￾overlapping toxicity such as TACE, target therapy, and other
potential drugs with anititumor effects on HCC in clinical
studies may potentially increases local control, decrease re￾gional failure and prolonged survival rates.
The major limitation of this study is that it was a retro￾spective single-institution study with small sample size, the
median survival rate was only 11 months, which is most
likely related to the unfavorable prognostic features of the
patient enrolled. Furthermore, late toxicity may be underes￾timated as a result of limited survival, especially when the
higher than conventional fractional dose is considered.
Conclusions
In conclusion, despite its unfavorable prognosis, our
study supports that Cyberknife SBRT is feasible in treat￾ing huge unresectable HCC, tumor response rate of
86.3% (CR + PR), 1-yr. local control rate of 55.56%. And
the 1-yr. Overall survival rate of 50% were encouraging.
While patients with a score of Child-Pugh A and those
receiving doses of at least 40 Gy were able to achieved a
1-yr local control rate of 66.67% as well as 71.43% were
promising Acute toxicities were mild and tolerable.
However, local and regional recurrence remained the
major problem. Prospective studies of combination of
SBRT with other treatment modalities may be suggested.
