Abstract
Background: Tuberous sclerosis (TS) is a rare autosomal dominant systemic disease with an estimated prevalence
of 1/6000. Renal angiomyolipoma (AML) is a benign tumour with high morbidity frequently present in TS. The aim
of the study was to test the effect of rapamycin in reducing the volume of AML in TS.
Methods: Twenty four-month prospective open-label, single arm, unicentre Phases II andIII study. The primary
endpoint was to evaluate the effect of treatment on the reduction of at least 50% AML volume from baseline at
24 months. The secondary endpoints were: average tumour reduction, surgical complications, skin lesions and
drug safety.
The study population comprised 17 patients, aged >10 years who were diagnosed with TS and had ≥1 renal
AML >2 cm of diameter and had a serum creatinine < 2mg/dl and urine protein/creatinine ratio < 22.6 mg/mmol.
The trial was conducted at Fundació Puigvert. Rapamycin was given to achieve stable plasma levels between 4 and
8 ng/ml. AML volume was estimated using orthogonal measurements by MRI at baseline, 6, 12 and 24 months.
Results: Ten out of 17 patients were success responders for the main outcome −58.8%, 95%CI: 32.9% to
81.6%-. After 6 months of therapy, the mean volume decrease was 55.18% (5.01 standard error (SE); p<0.001) and
66.38% (4.41 SE; p<0.001) at year 1. There was no significant decrease between year 1 and 2. According to RECIST
criteria, all patients achieved a partial response at year 1 and all but two had already achieved this partial response
after 6 months.
The main analysis was performed according to the intention-to-treat principle analysis. Tumour volume was
analyzed over time by means of mixed models for repeated measurement analysis. We used the baseline tumour
volume as a covariate for the absolute change and percentage change from baseline data. The analysis was
performed using SAS version 9.2 software, and the level of significance was established at 0.05 (two-sided).
Conclusions: This study show that mTOR inhibitors are a relatively safe, efficacious and less aggressive alternative
than currently available options in the management of AML in TS.

Background
Tuberous sclerosis (TS), or Bourneville-Pringle disease,
is a rare autosomal dominant systemic disease with an
estimated prevalence of 1/6000 [1].
Clinically, it manifests on the skin and may show
renal, neurological, pulmonary and cardiac symptoms.
The clinical presentation of TS ranges from few features
of the disease in adults to severe neurological involve￾ment in children [1].
Renal angiomyolipoma (AML) is a benign tumour
formed by abnormal vessels, immature smooth muscle
tissue, and adipocytes [2]. It is usually bilateral and mul￾tiple and its incidence ranges from 55% to 75% among
TS patients. Morbidity is high, as it can lead to spontan￾eous haemorrhage and, albeit more rarely in very bulky
AML, arterial hypertension and kidney failure [3]. This
is the most serious manifestation after neurological in￾volvement. The risk of rupture and spontaneous haem￾orrhage is generally related to the size of the AML and
is particularly frequent when the tumour is greater than
3–4 cm [4]. In general, resection is avoided due to the
loss of renal parenchyma and, therefore, kidney function.
To date, the main therapeutic options are embolisation,
elective surgery, and emergency nephrectomy in cases of
uncontrollable haemorrhage [2].
TS is caused by mutations in genes TSC1 and TSC2
[5-7]. TSC1 is responsible in a minimal percentage of
cases, and causes the most benign forms of the disease
[8]. It is located on chromosome 9q34, has 23 exons and
codes for the protein hamartin. TSC2 is located on
chromosome 16p13, has 41 exons and codes for the pro￾tein tuberin. Tuberin and hamartin combine in an
mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) regulatory
pathway. mTOR is made up of two distinct complexes:
mTORC1 and TORC2. The direct downstream targets
of mTORC1; the eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding
protein (4E-BP1) and ribosomal protein S6 kinase (S6K),
tightly regulate the translational initiation machinery to
control cell growth and proliferation. The mutations that
lead to tuberin or hamartin absence or dysfunction give
rise to disregulation of S6K and 4E-BP1 and to a loss of
control of proliferation [9]. Rapamycin (Sirolimus, Rapa￾muneW) is an immunosuppressive agent that inhibits
mTOR, thus it is theoretically able to control cell growth
and inadequate proliferation in patients with TS.
The objective of the present study was to demonstrate
whether mTOR inhibitors, such as rapamycin, are a safe
and effective therapeutic alternative to reducing the vol￾ume of AML in patients with TS.
Material and methods
Trial design
This trial was a 24-month, prospective, phase II-III study
(EudraCT number: 2007-005978-30, ClinicalTrials.gov
number: NCT0121712) conducted at Fundació Puigvert,
Barcelona from July 2008 to May 2011. The trial was
single-centre, non-controlled and non-blinded to test a
new therapeutic indication in a marketed drug. It was
carried out in accordance with the Declaration of Hel￾sinki and the Good Clinical Practice guidelines of the
International Conference on Harmonisation. The study
was designed by the investigators and approved by the
Fundació Puigvert Independent Ethics Committee and
authorised by the Spanish Agency for Medicines and
Medical Devices.
Objectives
The primary objective was to evaluate the effect of
rapamycin on the size of AML in patients with TS.
The main outcome measure was the number of pa￾tients in whom a 50% reduction was observed in the
size of the AML with the longest diameter compared
to baseline.
The secondary objectives were the evaluation of the ef￾fect of treatment on volume reduction, the percentage of
patients with surgical complications (bleeding, need for
embolisation and/or surgery), skin lesions, and drug
safety.
Eligibility
The study population comprised 17 patients aged over
10 years who were diagnosed with TS and had at least
1 renal AML > 2 cm in diameter (irrespective of central
nervous, cardiac, pulmonary, and/or cutaneous involve￾ment) and baseline creatinine < 2 mg/dl. Written
informed consent was provided in all cases. The Spanish
TS patients association assisted with recruitment of
patients and with study logistics such as patients’ travel
and specimen shipping. Patients were recruited from all
over Spain.
The exclusion criteria were: recent AML bleed, abnormal
liver function or complete blood count, proteinuria (calcu￾lated as a protein-to-creatinine ratio > 22.6 mg/mmol),
presence of active infection, history of surgery within
8 weeks before the start of treatment or neoplasm during
the previous 2 years, fasting cholesterol > 7.8 mmol/l, low￾density lipoprotein cholesterol > 5.1 mmol/l or triglycerides
> 4.6 mmol/l, and a history of allergy to macrolides. All
women underwent a pregnancy test before inclusion and
at each follow-up visit.
Follow-up and data collection
At the initial visit, patients received a dose of rapamycin
(1 mg/d). Steady-state levels of rapamycin were deter￾mined by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry
in blood. Doses were increased by 1 milligram every
2 weeks until stable plasma levels (4–8 ng/ml) were
achieved. Plasma samples were shipped every two weeks
Cabrera-López et al. Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases 2012, 7:87 Page 2 of 9
http://www.ojrd.com/content/7/1/87

in order to determine rapamycin levels at Fundació
Puigvert. These target rapamycin plasma levels were
chosen based on the ones used for preventing rejection
in renal transplant patients. Once reached, these levels
were monitored at the follow-up visits (3, 6, 9, 12, 18
and 24 months of treatment). At each visit, patients
underwent a physical examination, evaluation of adverse
effects and adherence, and comprehensive blood workup
(glucose, complete blood count, creatinine, MDRD, elec￾trolytes, liver profile, bilirubin, lipids, and urinalysis with
proteinuria calculated by ratio). Photographs of the skin
lesions were taken. Abdominal MRI was performed at
inclusion and at 6, 12 and 24 months.
In addition to the follow-up visits, each patient was
also contacted on a monthly basis by telephone. Patients
also had direct telephone access to the research team for
any incidents that arose during the study period. Ad￾verse events were recorded by evaluating the description,
duration, and treatment of each incident, and the re￾searcher determined whether there was a clear relation
between the condition and the trial drug. Severe and un￾expected adverse events were reported to healthcare au￾thorities and the Independent Ethics Committee in
accordance with the stipulations of Spanish Royal De￾cree 2004.
Abdominal imaging evaluations
Image technique
Abdominal imaging evaluations were performed by
1.5 Tesla magnetic resonance (Vantage Atlas, Toshiba
Medical Systems Corporation, Otawara-shi, Tochigi-ken,
JAPAN) with a body phased-array coil. All studies were
performed with the patient in supine position. Coronal,
sagittal and axial scans were acquired with T1-weighted
fast spoiled gradient echo and T2-weighted fast spin
echo protocols with and without fat suppression.
Image analysis
Abdominal studies were analyzed by two independent
radiologists with more than 10 years of experience inter￾preting abdominal imaging studies. Before the start of
this study, the radiologists showed an intra and inter￾observer variability of less than 5% in focal renal mass
measurement. Tumour volume was estimated using or￾thogonal measurements, which assume that the masses
are ellipsoid. In cases of AML with complex shapes, we
used a standardised validated software program (Vitrea,
Vital Imaging version 4.1.14.0.). When the tumour vol￾ume obtained by the two independent readers differed
(always by less than 5%), a mean value of both determi￾nations was calculated. In patients with multiple renal
lesions, only the largest one was analyzed.
Statistical methods
The sample size was set at 17 patients in order to have a
statistical power of at least 80%. This would make it pos￾sible to detect a difference in the study group with re￾spect to the efficacy expected in the untreated general
population (0%) with a two-tailed 5% protection against
alpha errors [10,11]. Ninety-five percent confidence
intervals (95% CI) were calculated for the main binary
outcome measure using exact methods, and missing data
was attributed to failure. The results were discussed with
regard to the previous population values observed for
this disease. The main analysis was performed according
to the intention-to-treat principle analysis including all
patients (n=17). The analysis was also performed with
the per protocol (PP) subset (including patients who
complete the 24 moths period follow-up, n=13) to assess
the robustness of the results.
Tumour volume was analyzed over time by means of
mixed models for repeated measurement analysis
(MMRM) [12], which assumes unmeasured observations
to be missing at random (MAR) [13]. We used the base￾line tumour volume as a covariate for the absolute
change and percentage change from baseline analyzes.
The analysis was performed using SAS version 9.2 soft￾ware (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC), and the level of sig￾nificance was established at 0.05 (two-sided).
The response was also post-hoc evaluated by the Re￾sponse Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST),
i.e., considering success patients with a 30% tumour re￾duction [14].
Limitations
As this study is non-controlled based on a small sample,
it is affected by all the limitations associated with this
methodology and with the interpretation of the results.
This design was chosen due to the low prevalence of the
disease and the limited availability of patients. The
single-centre design was chosen in order to attempt to
harmonise the criteria for the evaluation of response as
much as possible.
Results
Patients and protocol completion
From July 2008 to May 2009, a total of 22 patients
granted their consent to participate in the study. Of
these, 17 were eligible for the study (8 men and
9 women) (Table 1). Three patients had undergone pre￾vious unilateral nephrectomy. The AML were bilateral
in all patients and all patients also had a cranial MRI at
the screening that showed no astrocytomas. No patient
had been diagnosed with LAM (lymphangioleiomyoma￾tosis). Eleven patients had a history of seizures and were
on antiepileptic treatment. These patients needed higher
doses of rapamycin to achieve the same plasma levels as
Cabrera-López et al. Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases 2012, 7:87 Page 3 of 9
http://www.ojrd.com/content/7/1/87

the ones not taking antiepileptic drugs. The mean
plasma rapamycin level was: 6.37 ng/ml (SD: 0.91 ng/ml,
range: 4.77-8 ng/ml). For the subgroup of patients on
antiepileptic drugs, this figure was 6.13 ng/ml (SD:
0.80 ng/ml, range: 4.8-7.7 ng/ml) and for those not tak￾ing antiepileptic drugs it was 6.8 ng/ml (SD: 0.99 ng/ml,
range: 5.2-8 ng/ml). The mean dose given to patients
was 4.9 mg per day (SD: 1.75 mg per day, range 2–7.75).
For the subgroup of patients under antiepileptic drugs,
the figure was 5.6 mg per day (SD: 1.80 mg per day,
range: 3.25-7.75 mg per day) and for those not taking
antiepileptic drugs it was 3.8 mg per day (SD: 1.09 mg
per day, range: 2–4.75 mg per day). The means were cal￾culated based on data from months 6, 12, 18 and 24.
Of the 17 patients included in the study, 16 completed
the 12 months of treatment (Figure 1). Patient 4 was
excluded at 10 months due to acute pyelonephritis and
did not want to be rechallenged. Patient 17 was dechal￾lenged at 14 months due to reactivation of the erythema
nodosum that was present at inclusion and was not
rechallenged, and patient 3 was withdrawn at 12 months
of treatment due to nephrotic-range proteinuria
that reverted after discontinuation of treatment. Patient
14 underwent major surgery due to infection of the
frontal sinus and was dechallenged from month 13 to
month 19.
Outcomes
Ten out of 17 patients achieved a 50% tumour reduction
from baseline at 24 months (58.8%, [95%CI]: 32.92% to
81.56%) for the “intention to treat” (ITT) population,
and 10 of 13 (76.9% [46.2%,95.0%]) for the PP subset
(Table 2). The percentage decrease in the volume of the
AML at 6, 12 and 24 months of treatment for each par￾ticipant is shown in Figure 1. According to RECIST cri￾teria, all patients achieved a partial response at one year
and all but two had already achieved this partial re￾sponse at 6 months (Figure 1, Table 2). Although the re￾sponse persisted at 2 years the decrease in the
percentage of volume was much more significant from
time 0 to 1 year than from 1 to 2 years (see Table 2). In

fact, there was no significant reduction in volume be￾tween 1 and 2 years, there were even some increases in
volume. It is important to note that patient 14 had a
MRI at 2 years but had not been taking rapamycin from
month 13 to month 19 due to major surgery. In this pa￾tient, after 7 months of withdrawal and 4 months of
rechallenge, the AML volume increased by 39.3% and
remained similar to the volume at 6 months. Figure 2
shows a reduction in AML volume at 6 months.
No patient required AML surgery or embolization
during the study.
Facial angiofibromas decreased in size and became paler
and less rough (Figure 3). No objective quantification
could be obtained. Although no changes in the shagreen
patches or in the hypomelanic macules were detected,
subjective improvement of periungual fibroma were
reported. Although this was not a study endpoint, a slight
improvement in the frequency of seizures was reported by
some parents.
Adverse events
The most common undesirable effects were as follows,
and were considered mild: oral aphthous ulcers just after
starting treatment (resolved with topical corticosteroids);
hypertriglyceridaemia (controlled with medical treat￾ment) (Table 3, Table 4); self-limiting episodes of diar￾rhoea; acneiform rash, microalbuminuria, microcytosis
and hypochromia. Seven patients had increased their
basal microalbuminuria and 9 did not show any signs of
microalbuminuria (see Table 4). All these events were
considered related to the treatment drug. Renal function
remained stable during the study in all patients (Table 4).
There were two severe adverse events that led to discon￾tinuation of the treatment: nephrotic range proteinuria
(appeared after 12 months of treatment, persisted with
ACEI treatment and disappeared after rapamycin dis￾continuation) and exacerbation of erythema nodosum
(appeared after 14 months of treatment and fully remit￾ted after withdrawal). Both events were considered to be
related to the treatment drug. One patient was hospita￾lised due to acute pyelonephritis, which was considered
to be unrelated to the treatment. And another patient

underwent major frontal sinus surgery which was also
considered to be unrelated to the treatment drug.
Discussion
This study demonstrates that mTOR inhibition through
the use of rapamycin is effective in reducing AML vol￾ume in TS patients and has an acceptable safety profile.
The drug is marketed and indicated for prophylaxis of
acute rejection in adult kidney transplant recipients with
low immunological risk.
Preliminary clinical data suggest that rapamycin could
play a beneficial role in the treatment of TS [15,16].
There are case reports in which the size of astrocytomas
or angiomyolipomas decreased in patients with TS and
good tolerability was reported [17-21]. Also some clin￾ical trials showed beneficial effect of mTOR inhibitors in
lymphangioleiomyomatosis [22] and astrocytomas [23].
Moreover, 3 clinical trials show evidence of AML re￾sponse to mTOR inhibition [24-26]. In a non-controlled,
phase II trial, Bissler JJ et al. showed a reduction in the
size of renal angiomyolipomas (53.2% ± 26.6%) in 14
TSC patients with AML larger than 1 centimetre in size
treated over 1 year [24] . Davies DM et al. also carried
out a non-controlled trial with 16 patients with AML
and TSC or LAM. Seven patients with TSC and AML
reached 2 years of treatment with sirolimus and the
results showed a significant reduction of AML burden
[25]. The response rate, by RECIST criteria, was 50%,
being all partial responses Very recently Dabora SL et al.
reported their experience in treating 36 patients with
TSC or LAM with Sirolimus for one year and had a
44.4% response rate (partial responses in all cases)
according to RECIST criteria [26]. We also reported the
preliminary results at one year observing an excellent re￾sponse to treatment [27]. An explanation for the higher
success rates in our trial compared to others may be that
we focused the evaluation of AML volume decrease in
the largest AML while others analyzed the AML in gen￾eral. Perhaps, the greater AML have a better response to
treatment than smaller ones, based on its hypothetically
higher mitotic rate.
The hypothesis of this trial is that inhibitors of the Akt
signalling cascade, such as rapamycin, can block the in￾adequate proliferation observed in TS in the form of
AML [28]. The drug reduces vascular endothelial growth
factor (VEGF) plasma levels and, taking into account the
considerable tumour vascularisation in TS caused by up￾regulation of VEGF, its anti-angiogenic action could
prove very beneficial [29].
This study is the largest and longest carried out to
date focused on AML in patients with TSC without
LAM. The results show that AML shrank faster early on
in the trial and persist with approximately the same
Figure 3 Facial angiofibromas improvement after 2 years of therapy.

volume while on treatment. There is a significant de￾crease in volume after six months of treatment, which
continues at a slower rate up to one year, but remains
stable from 1 to 2 years (RECIST partial response rate:
100% at one year). This evidence suggests that the
shrinkage power of the drug is at its maximum at the be￾ginning, probably due to its anti-angiogenic effect. And,
although there does not seem to be any beneficial effect
after one year, there is indeed, as some authors demon￾strated by withdrawing the treatment and then showing
an increase in AML volume [24,26]. Therefore, it seems
reasonable to assume that TSC patients with large AML
should be kept under mTOR inhibition for life. This sug￾gestion may raise two concerns: what the optimal dose is
and whether we can accept the side effects of the drug
for a lifetime. In this study, we experienced a great deal
of trouble achieving the desired target plasma levels of
sirolimus in patients on antiepileptic treatment, which is
very common among TSC patients. Moreover, all
patients in general needed higher doses than trans￾planted patients to achieve the same target plasma levels.
Larger studies and a long follow-up period should ad￾dress whether low doses of mTOR inhibitors are enough
to prevent AML growth after the initial reduction. The
most frequent adverse reactions we recorded were
stomatitis (27.7%), which was observed at the start of
treatment. The reaction was dose-dependent and easily
managed with topical corticosteroids and dose adjust￾ment. The next most frequent reaction was hypertrigly￾ceridaemia (22.2%) mainly in patients who already had
high triglyceride levels prior to inclusion. Medical treat￾ment was provided in most cases. Given the anti￾proliferative effect of rapamycin, we also observed micro￾cytosis and hypochromia (16.6%), with normal results for
iron metabolism and stable haemoglobin values. A total
of 41% of patients developed microalbuminuria but no
patients developed impaired renal function. However,
the development of microalbuminuria raises the con￾cern on the long term effects on renal function of
mTOR inhibition. Two patients were withdrawn be￾cause of serious adverse events, one due to reactivation
of erythema nodosum and the other due to nephrotic￾range proteinuria, which fully resolved after discontinu￾ation of the treatment.
There are efficacy reports on topical and oral rapamy￾cin for facial angiofibromas in TSC patients [30,31],
however this clinical feature has not been analyzed in
previous trials using systemic rapamycin. In this study,
we noticed an improvement in facial angiofibromas and
a subjective improvement of periungual fibromas.

Conclusions
The results of this study show that mTOR inhibitors are
a relatively safe and effective therapeutic alternative in
the management of AML in patients with TS. These
agents represent a therapeutic alternative that is less ag￾gressive than the options currently available and, above
all, compared with the available existing therapies, is
expected to preserve renal function.
The efficacy and acceptable safety profile of mTOR
inhibitors in patients with TS shown in this trial and the
other 3 trials mentioned above make mTOR inhibitors a
drug with high potential for becoming a first-line treat￾ment in TSC. However, individualised treatment is
expected; mTOR inhibitors are not harmless and custo￾mised therapy is anticipated in those patients with AML
with high chances of bleeding.
