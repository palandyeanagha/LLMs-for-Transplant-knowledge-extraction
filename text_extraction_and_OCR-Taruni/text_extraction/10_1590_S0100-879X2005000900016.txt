Abstract
End-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients frequently develop structural
cardiac abnormalities, particularly left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH).
The mechanisms involved in these processes are not completely
understood. In the present study, we evaluated a possible association
between parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels and left ventricular mass
(LVM) in patients with ESRD. Stable uremic patients on intermittent
hemodialysis treatment were evaluated by standard two-dimensional
echocardiography and their sera were analyzed for intact PTH. Forty￾one patients (mean age 45 years, range 18 to 61 years), 61% males,
who had been on hemodialysis for 3 to 186 months, were evaluated.
Patients were stratified into 3 groups according to serum PTH: low
levels (<100 pg/ml; group I = 10 patients), intermediate levels (100 to
280 pg/ml; group II = 10 patients) and high levels (>280 pg/ml; group
III = 21 patients). A positive statistically significant association
between LVM index and PTH was identified (r = 0.34; P = 0.03,
Pearson’s correlation coefficient) in the sample as a whole. In sub￾group analyses, we did not observe significant associations in the low
and intermediate PTH groups; nevertheless, PTH and LVM index
were correlated in patients with high PTH levels (r = 0.62; P = 0.003).
LVM index was also inversely associated with hemoglobin (r = -0.34;
P = 0.03). In multivariate analysis, after adjustment for age, hemoglo￾bin, body mass index, and blood pressure, the only independent
predictor of LVM index was PTH level. Therefore, PTH is an inde￾pendent predictor of LVH in patients undergoing chronic hemodialy￾sis. Secondary hyperparathyroidism may contribute to the elevated
cardiovascular morbidity associated with LVH in ESRD.

Introduction
End-stage renal disease (ESRD) has been
associated with changes in the structure and
function of the myocardium (1). A signifi￾cant percentage of patients who start dialysis
treatment have cardiac abnormalities, par￾ticularly left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH)
(2). Likewise, approximately 70% of the
patients under chronic hemodialysis treat￾ment present LVH (2,3). Different condi￾tions have been implicated in the pathogen-

esis of ESRD-related LVH, such as hyper￾tension, chronic anemia, arteriovenous fis￾tulas, concurrent ischemic heart disease, and
hypoalbuminemia. These factors have inde￾pendent effects, which possibly act syner￾gistically leading to LVH and its related
morbidity and mortality (4,5).
Recently, parathyroid hormone (PTH) has
been identified as an important cardiotoxin
in ESRD. Previous studies have supported
the view that high PTH serum levels in
uremic patients may cause deleterious ef￾fects in myocardium metabolism and func￾tion (4). The association between PTH lev￾els and LVH has been reported by some
investigators, with inconsistent results (6-9).
The present study was therefore conducted
to evaluate the independent association be￾tween intact PTH levels and the presence of
LVH in end-stage stable uremic patients
under chronic hemodialysis, in whom other
known risk factors for LVH were not pres￾ent.
Material and Methods
Subjects
Forty-one adult ESRD patients receiving
renal replacement therapy with hemodialy￾sis for at least three months were included.
Patients with diabetes mellitus, severe ane￾mia (hematocrit <20%), body mass index
(BMI) <15 kg/m2, coronary artery disease,
uncontrolled hypertension, primary or sec￾ondary cardiomyopathies, known valvular
heart disease or pericarditis, a history of
heavy alcohol consumption associated with
altered liver function tests, parathyroidec￾tomy, and connective tissue disease were
excluded. All patients who agreed to partici￾pate in this protocol signed an informed
consent document. The research protocol
was approved regarding its ethical and meth￾odological aspects by the Ethics Committee
in Research Procedures of Hospital de
Clínicas de Porto Alegre, Universidade Fe￾deral do Rio Grande do Sul Medical School,
accredited by the Brazilian National Re￾search Committee, and registered at the Of￾fice for Human Research Protection (OHRP￾USDHHS) as an Institutional Reviewing
Bureau (IRB 00000921).
Two-dimensional echocardiography
Color Doppler echocardiograms were
performed by one of the investigators (LER)
using the ATL HDI 5000 (ATL Ultrasound,
Bothel, WA, USA) ultrasound equipment
with a 2.5-3.5 MHz transducer and harmonic
imaging. Echocardiograms were performed
with the patients within a maximum of 3%
above the estimated dry weight (weight when
normotensive and free of edema). The echo￾cardiographic parameters studied in this pro￾tocol were evaluated according to the rec￾ommendations of the American Society of
Echocardiography. For each measurement,
3-5 consecutive cardiac cycles were ana￾lyzed and the average was computed. Left
ventricular mass (LVM) was calculated ac￾cording to the modified cube formula pro￾posed by Devereux et al. (10). LVM index
was calculated by dividing LVM by body
surface. An LVM index above 100 g/m2 for
women and above 131 g/m2 for men was
considered to indicate LVH (11).
Blood analysis
Plasma PTH measurements were carried
out by a radioimmunoassay technique meas￾uring intact PTH (Immunolite 2000, Diag￾nostic Products Corporation, Los Angeles,
CA, USA). Intra-assay and interassay coef￾ficients of variation for this test are 5.7 and
8.8, respectively. The patients were classi￾fied into three groups according to their
plasma PTH levels: group I, PTH <100 pg/
ml (low PTH levels, N = 10); group II, PTH
between 100 to 280 pg/ml (intermediate PTH
levels, N = 10), and group III, PTH >280 pg/
ml (high PTH levels, N = 21).

Other laboratory tests were carried out
by standardized clinical laboratory methods
and included total alkaline phosphatases,
bone-fraction alkaline phosphatase, total
calcium, phosphorous, pre- and post-dialy￾sis urea, creatinine, alanine aminotransferase,
aspartate aminotransferase, albumin, total
cholesterol, triglycerides, hematocrit, hemo￾globin, serum iron, and serum aluminum.
Bone-fraction alkaline phosphatase was
measured by the thermal inactive enzyme
method (12). Averaged 12-month data of
urea fractional clearance and urea reduction
rate were used for the biochemical evalua￾tion of dialysis adequacy.
Other measurements
Blood pressure was evaluated by averag￾ing the measurements obtained before he￾modialysis over a period of 6 months pre￾ceding the echocardiographic examination.
BMI was calculated using the formula: BMI
= weight/height2 (kg/m2).
Statistical analysis
Data are reported as means ± SD or as
percentages. Differences in echocardiographic,
clinical, and laboratory variables between dif￾ferent PTH groups were evaluated by analysis
of variance. The Tukey test was used for
multiple comparisons. The association between
PTH and LVM index and the other variables
was evaluated by Pearson’s correlation coeffi￾cient. Multiple linear regression analysis was
used to evaluate the relation between PTH and
LVM index, controlling for variables that may
potentially influence LVM index. A two-tailed
P value <0.05 was considered to be statisti￾cally significant. Statistical analysis was car￾ried out using the SPSS Program, version 8.0.
Results
The demographic and anthropometric
characteristics of the patients are presented
in Table 1. Causes of renal failure were: a)
hypertensive nephrosclerosis in 10 (24%)
patients, b) polycystic kidney disease in 8

obstructive uropathy in 4 (10%), e) Alport
syndrome, chronic pyelonephritis, U-shaped
kidneys and HIV nephropathy in 1 (2%)
patient each, and e) undetermined etiology
in 11 (24%) patients.
Laboratory variables are shown in Table

Discussion
Several factors contribute to the devel￾opment of LVH in patients on intermittent
hemodialysis treatment, including chronic
hypervolemic state, anemia, elevated blood
pressure, and arteriovenous fistula (3). It has
been suggested that secondary hyperpara￾thyroidism may also play a role in the car￾diovascular disease of end-stage uremia (2,7),
although previous studies evaluating the role
of PTH in LVH in ESRD patients have led to
contradictory results (6-9).
In the present study, a well-selected
sample of patients was examined. Our data
indicate that LVH is positively correlated
with PTH levels, particularly in patients with
significant secondary hyperparathyroidism.
However, this correlation does not hold true
for patients with intermediate or low PTH
levels. These findings were unchanged after
multiple regression adjustment for other pa￾rameters involved in LVH. Interestingly, in￾termediate PTH levels are considered ad￾equate for the bone remodeling processes in
uremic patients (13).
Our results agree with those of Stack and
Saran (14) who reported that PTH levels
above 157 pg/ml correlated independently
with the development of LVH. Neverthe￾less, contradictory findings about the role of
secondary hyperparathyroidism in cardiac
changes have been reported in chronic ure￾mic patients. London et al. (6) presented
contradictory results concerning the correla￾tion between PTH levels and LVM index,
describing a significant negative associa￾tion. The reason for this discrepancy is not
clear, but may be related in part to some
methodological aspects. Firstly, PTH values
were relatively higher in our patients with
great variability in the group of more severe
hyperparathyroidism. Secondly, London et
al. (6) used a PTH radioimmunoassay tech￾nique detecting the terminal C-fragment. This
technique measures predominantly inactive
PTH metabolites whose excretion is reduced
in renal failure (15). These metabolites have
biological effects on target tissues including
the heart that differ from those of intact
PTH.
Anemia is considered to be an important
factor in the pathogenesis of LVH, contrib￾uting to increased cardiovascular mortality
in dialysis patients (16). In the overall group,
we observed that hemoglobin was negatively
associated with LVM index. However, in
multivariate analysis, the correlation of PTH
with LVM index was independent of anemia
and several other potential confounding fac￾tors. Moreover, in patients on dialysis, the
presence of anemia is combined with chronic
volume overload and it has been shown that
the use of human recombinant erythropoi￾etin can attenuate LVH by correcting ane￾mia (17).
High blood pressure is also strongly as￾sociated with LVH development (16,18,19).
Foley et al. (18) showed that hypertension in
chronic dialysis is associated with concen￾tric hypertrophy of the left ventricle. Hyper￾tensive hemodialysis patients have LVM in￾dices that are significantly higher than their
normotensive counterparts. However, LVM
indices are similar to those of non-uremic
hypertensive patients, demonstrating that
inadequate blood pressure control is an im￾portant factor for the development of LVH
(20). In order to avoid such an interaction,
we selected for the present study only nor￾motensive or well-controlled hypertensive
patients. Among the 19 patients using anti￾hypertensive medications, 14 were taking 1
drug and 5 were taking two drugs for blood
pressure control (data not shown). Systolic
blood pressure, which was included in the
multivariate analysis, did not affect the asso￾ciation of PHT with LVH.
In the past years, there has been compel￾ling evidence that the cardiovascular system
is a major target of PTH action, suggesting

1415
Braz J Med Biol Res 38(9) 2005
Secondary hyperparathyroidism and left ventricular hypertrophy
that its chronic elevation in ESRD patients
adversely affects myocardial metabolism and
function (4). LVH in uremic patients is not
only characterized by an increased myocar￾dial fiber mass but also by myocardial inter￾stitial fibrosis (21). The mechanisms by
which PTH induces LVH have not been
completely elucidated. Studies have shown
increased cytosolic calcium and/or protein
kinase C activation. Expression of cardiac
proto-oncogene may be enhanced, which in
turn may lead to altered expression of sev￾eral genes involved on cardiac structure and
action and ultimately stimulate the transla￾tion of contractile and non-contractile car￾diac muscle proteins leading to LVH (22).
These studies also suggest that PTH has a
permissive role for fibroblast activation and
myocardial fibrosis. Thus, it has been ob￾served that elevated PTH levels in ESRD
cause irreversible interstitial fibrosis with
collagen deposition (23). Following para￾thyroidectomy in animals with chronic renal
failure, a reduction of collagen deposition in
the myocardium is consistently observed
(22). Interactions between PTH levels and
cardiac abnormalities specifically related to
LVH and left ventricular diastolic dysfunc￾tion were shown in patients with primary
hyperparathyroidism as well (24-26). Such
abnormalities were independent of plasma
calcium levels and hypertension and also
regressed following parathyroid mass re￾duction (24-27).
Since numerous factors are involved in
the genesis of LVH in chronic hemodialysis
patients, one should not expect that isolated
interventions on specific targets will lead to
complete correction of this condition. Con￾trol of these factors, however, is vital and
may significantly reduce LVH related to
ESRD. This can be observed in patients after
successful renal transplantation (28). More￾over, it has been demonstrated that parathy￾roidectomy exerts a significant role in de￾creasing LVM index among dialysis patients
with tertiary hyperparathyroidism (29).
Although several comorbidities associ￾ated with chronic renal failure may contri￾bute to the development of LVH, the find￾ings of the present study suggest that sec￾ondary hyperparathyroidism plays an im￾portant and independent role in this process.
Based on the current state of our knowledge,
patients with early renal failure should have
their PTH levels monitored and kept within
adequate levels, by the judicious use of rou￾tine interventions, including dietary protein
restriction, the prescription of phosphate
binders and the proper use of vitamin D
analogs. It also seems adequate to periodi￾cally evaluate left ventricular morphologi￾cal parameters and cardiac geometry by echo￾cardiography, especially in those patients
with multiple risk factors for LVH develop￾ment.
