Abstract. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) related 
to insulin resistance (IR) is a growing global health concern. 
Recent studies have indicated that metformin could improve IR 
and may be beneficial in the treatment of NAFLD. This study 
aimed to assess the beneficial or harmful effects of metformin 
in NAFLD. We searched Medline and four other databases 
during April 2012. Selection criteria were randomized clinical 
trials comparing metformin with placebo or other interven￾tions for treating NAFLD patients. The primary outcome 
was histological response. The secondary outcomes included 
alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase 
(AST), homeostasis model assessment of IR (HOMA‑IR), 
body mass index (BMI) and adverse events. Dichotomous data 
were reported as odds ratio (OR), while continuous data were 
calculated as the mean difference (MD), both with 95% confi￾dence intervals (CI). Random and fixed effects meta-analyses 
were performed. Nine studies were included, involving 
417 participants, and conducted for a time period ranging 
from 4 to 12 months. In the treated participants, improvements 
were observed in ALT (MD, -8.12 U/l; P=0.03), AST (MD, 
-4.52 U/l; P=0.04), HOMA‑IR (MD, -0.61; P=0.005) and BMI 
(MD, -0.82 kg/m2
; P=0.04), but not in histological response: 
steatosis (P=0.66), inflammation (P=0.91), hepatocellular 
ballooning (P=0.25) and fibrosis (P=0.90). Sub‑analysis of 
non‑alcoholic fatty steatohepatitis showed that metformin 
failed to improve any pooled outcome. Adverse events were 
poorly reported. Current information indicates that metformin 
improves liver function, HOMA‑IR and BMI to some extent, 
but not histological response in NAFLD patients. This finding 
could serve as a stimulus for future studies investigating issues 
such as dose‑responsiveness, safety and patient tolerance to 
metformin therapy.
Introduction
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a burgeoning 
health problem that affects 1/3 of the adult population and an 
increasing number of children in developed countries (1,2). 
NAFLD includes a wide spectrum of histologic abnormalities 
ranging from hepatic steatosis (3) to non‑alcoholic steatohepa￾titis (NASH) that may progress to cirrhosis, and subsequent 
end‑stage liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma (4,5). 
NAFLD is characterized by fat accumulation in the liver in 
patients with no statistically significant alcohol consump￾tion, and is particularly associated with metabolic syndrome 
comprising hypertension, insulin resistance (IR), obesity and 
dyslipidaemia (6). NAFLD has been shown to be strongly 
and independently associated with an increased risk of type 2 
diabetes and cardiovascular disease (7,8).
The pathogenesis of NAFLD is complex and not fully 
elucidated. The classical supporting theory is the ‘two‑hit’ 
hypothesis (9,10), whereby IR leads to hepatic steatosis (first 
hit), while the steatosis subsequently sensitizes the liver to a 
variety of metabolic injuries (second hit) leading to necroin￾flammation and fibrosis. Since IR is crucial in the pathogenesis 
of NAFLD, insulin‑sensitizing drugs, such as metformin may 
offer a therapeutic benefit. Metformin probably interrupts 
mitochondrial oxidative processes, resulting in a reduced ATP/
AMP ratio and subsequently in the activation of AMP‑activated 
protein kinase, a major cell regulator of lipid and glucose 
metabolism (11,12). The activation of AMP‑activated protein 
kinase in the liver stimulates β-oxidation of fatty acids and 
inhibits de novo synthesis, thus potentially leading to reduced 
liver steatosis (13).
At present, the ideal treatment for NAFLD has yet to be 
identified. Current treatments, such as lifestyle modifica￾tion and weight loss, are often difficult to achieve and hard

to maintain (14). Therefore, new therapeutic approaches 
for the management of NAFLD are required. Metformin is 
non‑hepatotoxic and cost-effective, therefore, it is more suit￾able for long-term treatment (15). Thus, a number of clinical 
trials have evaluated the use of metformin in the treatment of 
NAFLD (16,17). However, the mixed results, heterogeneous 
therapeutic approaches and small number of patients have 
limited its widespread use in clinical practice. A recent 
meta‑analysis of randomized control trials (RCT) including 
sub‑analysis of the efficacy of metformin on histological and 
biochemical outcomes in biopsy‑proven NASH, suggested that 
metformin is not an effective treatment for NASH (17). The 
authors explained the strict inclusion criteria with the histo￾logical definition of NAFLD or NASH, while only three RCTs 
were included as barriers to the meta‑analysis with regards to 
the effect of metformin on NAFLD. However, several studies, 
including more recent RCT data, and an additional review have 
shown that metformin may improve metabolic variables in 
NAFLD patients, especially in patients meeting the diagnostic 
criteria of metabolic syndrome (18). Therefore, the aim of this 
systematic review and meta‑analysis was to further assess the 
beneficial and harmful effects of metformin on NAFLD.
Materials and methods
Search strategy. A systematic computer‑assisted search was 
conducted by two independent investigators (Y.L. and L.L.) 
with disagreements resolved by mutual discussion. Databases 
searched during April 2012 included Medline, Cochrane the 
Central Register of Controlled Trials, the Cochrane Database of 
Systematic Reviews, Embase, Science Citation Index Expanded 
and The Chinese Biomedical Database. The meeting proceed￾ings (American Gastroenterological Association/American 
Association for the Study of Liver Diseases/Digestive Disease 
Week meeting abstracts/European Association for the Study 
of the Liver) and reference lists of reviews were searched 
manually for additional relevant studies. The authors of locally 
published and unpublished studies were contacted for thor￾oughness. Search terms included ‘Metformin’, ‘Biguanides’, 
‘Glucophag’, ‘NAFLD’, ‘NASH’, ‘nonalcoholic fatty liver 
disease’, ‘nonalcoholic steatohepatitis’, ‘liver fat’, ‘fatty liver’, 
‘steatosis’, ‘AST’, ‘ALT’, ‘aminotransferase’, ‘liver enzymes’ 
and ‘trial’.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria. Two investigators (Y.L. 
and D.C.) determined the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 
and reviewed the titles and abstracts of the studies identified. 
Inclusion criteria were: i) RCTs using metformin in patients 
with NAFLD or NASH; ii) NAFLD or NASH diagnosed 
by histology or suggestive imaging findings (ultrasound, 
computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging) with 
abnormal aminotransferase; iii) comparators could be placebo, 
no intervention or other intervention and iv) adult patients 
of any gender or ethnic origin (age, ≥18 years). Exclusion 
criteria were: i) non‑human studies or non‑randomized trials; 
ii) participants with addressed alcoholic, drug‑induced, total 
parenteral nutrition‑induced, viral or genetic causes of liver 
injury; iii) combination of metformin and other therapeutic 
approaches (e.g., thiazolidinediones and antioxidants) and 
iv) letters/case reports or studies enrolling <10 subjects, or 
manuscripts without adequate data or reviews. There was no 
restriction on languages.
Outcome measures. The primary outcome was a change in 
histological response quantified by needle biopsy and histo￾logical assessment, proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy 
(1H MRS), or inferred by ultrasonography (US). The secondary 
outcomes included alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate 
aminotransferase (AST), insulin sensitivity (measured by 
homeostasis model assessment of IR ‘HOMA‑IR’) and body 
mass index (BMI). Incident adverse events were also evaluated.
Data extraction. Two investigators (Y.L. and L.L.) indepen￾dently assessed the selected studies. Y.L. abstracted data and 
then L.L. checked the data extraction. The agreement in data 
extraction measured by a κ statistic and discrepancies were 
resolved by consensus. The data extracted included: i) study: 
date, location and funding of the trial, length of follow‑up, 
use of intention‑to‑treat analyses and the publication status; 
ii) patients: number, inclusion and exclusion criteria, mean (or 
median) age and gender ratio; iii) treatment: dose, duration 
and mode of administration of various metformin and/or of 
additional comparators and v) outcome: histological response, 
ALT, AST, BMI, HOMA‑IR and adverse effects.
Missing data. In the cases where the information of interest 
was not presented in the published studies, the investigators 
contacted the corresponding authors to obtain additional 
information. For incomplete or missing dichotomous data, 
sensitivity analysis was performed by excluding the studies 
that appeared as outliers in the forest plots. For missing stan￾dard deviations (SD) of the mean change in continuous data, 
and where the P‑value was provided for the two groups, SD 
was calculated by converting the P‑value into a t‑value with 
appropriate degrees of freedom (19). Studies in which partici￾pants dropped out, thereby presenting these percentages, were 
not excluded.
Methodological quality assessment. Methodological quality 
was assessed by two investigators (Y.L. and J.W.) using the 
Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool with a potential risk of bias of 
high, low or unclear (19). Quality assessment was based on 
the following domains: i) sequence generation; ii) allocation 
concealment; iii) blinding of participants, personnel and 
outcome assessors; iv) completeness of outcome data; v) unbi￾ased outcome reporting and vi) source of funding. If all six 
domains were well‑described, the studies were categorized as 
high quality, otherwise as low quality.
Data analysis. The analyses were conducted using the Review 
Manager (RevMan Version 5.1.6 Copenhagen: The Cochrane 
Collaboration 2012). The primary outcome (histological 
response) was assessed as a dichotomous variable (presented 
as OR with 95% CI). The secondary outcomes (ALT, AST, 
HOMA‑IR and BMI) were presented as continuous variables 
(presented as MD and 95% CI). Five analyses were carried 
out to compare the effect of i) metformin vs. control on 
liver histological response, ii) metformin vs. control on ALT 
change and iii) metformin vs. control on AST change, iv) 
metformin vs. control on BMI change and v) metformin vs. 

BIOMEDICAL REPORTS 1: 57-64, 2013 59
control on HOMA‑IR change. Random effect models were 
used in most meta-analyses, while statistical heterogeneity 
was evaluated using Cochran's Q statistic (P<0.10) and the 
I2
 statistic. Where Cochran's Q statistic (P>0.10) or an I2
statistic was >50%, the summary meta‑analysis was aban￾doned and potential sources were examined using stratified 
analyses. Subgroup analysis was carried out for two groups: 
i) diabetics and non‑diabetics; ii) NAFLD and NASH popula￾tion. Sensitivity analysis was performed by excluding lower 
quality studies from the meta‑analysis and assessing the 
effect on the summary estimate.
Results
Literature search. A total of 1,647 non‑duplicated studies 
were retrieved from the broad search terms used. After review 
of the titles and abstracts of these studies, 1,628 were excluded. 
Nineteen studies underwent full text review and 10 were 
subsequently excluded for the following reasons: 4 were pilot 
studies or cross-sectional investigations, 4 were not random￾ized and 2 were reviews. Therefore, 9 studies were included in 
this systematic review and meta‑analysis (Fig. 1).
Trial characteristics. The trials were published in English 
between 2004 and 2011 and reported similar inclusion and 
exclusion criteria (Table I). The nine trials included comprised 
a total study population of 417 individuals. The dose of 
metformin ranged from 0.5 to 3 g/day, while the duration 
of treatment was 4 months in a sole study, 6 months in four 
studies and 12 months in the remaining four studies. Three

trials were placebo‑controlled (n=130) (20-22), three used diet 
as the control (n=168) (23-25), while the remaining three trials 
used diet and exercise as the control (n=119) (26-28). The mean 
age of the participants ranged from 41 to 54 years.
Methodological quality and risk of bias. The consensus 
between two investigators regarding the study selection and 
the quality assessment of trials was 0.81 and 0.92, respec￾tively. The methodological quality and risk of bias of the nine 
included studies are shown in Fig. 2. Overall, three studies 
(20,21,25) had a low risk of bias in random sequence genera￾tion and two studies (20,21) had a low risk of bias in allocation 
concealment. Blinding of outcome assessment was performed 
in five studies (20-22,24,28) and only one study was funded by 
a Health Authority (20).
Outcomes reporting. The primary outcome was reported sepa￾rately (Table II). Two studies (24,28) provided the data of the 
liver fatty changes diagnosed by US. Four studies (20,21,25,27) 
reported the number of patients that improved following diag￾nosis by liver biopsy. The secondary outcomes were integrated, 
especially with respect to ALT and AST. Partial data of BMI 
and HOMA‑IR were obtained from the figures provided, only 
a small proportion of data was not reported.
Primary outcome
Histological response. Histological response was assessed 
only in four studies (20,21,25,27), evaluating the scores 
of steatosis, inflammation, hepatocellular ballooning and 
fibrosis prior and subsequent to treatment. Since these scores 
were not continuous variables, we calculated the number 
of patients with improvement in each histological variable. 
Participants treated with metformin showed no improve￾ment in histological variables compared to those treated with 
placebo or diet and exercise. OR was 1.30 (95% CI, 0.41-
4.08; I2
=47%; P=0.66) for steatosis, 1.08 (95% CI, 0.29-3.99;

=39%; P=0.91) for inflammation, 1.89 (95% CI, 0.64-5.64; 
I2
=37%; P=0.25) for hepatocellular ballooning, and 0.93 
(95% CI, 0.31-2.83; I2
=0%; P=0.90) for fibrosis (Fig. 3). When 
liver fat [diagnosed by US (24,28)] data alone were analyzed, 
metformin did not affect any liver fat (OR=0.93; 95% CI, 
0.32-2.74; I2
=0%; P=0.89). No improvement was observed in 
the histological variables in the subgroup analyses of diabetic 
or non‑diabetic patients.
Secondary outcomes
ALT. ALT activity was evaluated in the included studies. A 
statistically significant reduction was observed in ALT in 
metformin‑treated patients (MD, -8.12 U/l; 95% CI, -15.41 to

=69%). 
Subgroup analysis showed improvement in ALT in NAFLD 
(MD, -8.44 U/l; I2
=73%; P=0.04), but not in NASH patients 
(MD, -5.18 U/l; P=0.62), although the analysis of the two 
subgroups demonstrated statistically significant heterogeneity 
(I2
=73%).
AST. AST was reported in 8/9 studies. Overall, 
metformin‑treated patients showed only a modest, but statisti￾cally significant (P=0.04) decrease in AST (MD, -4.52 U/l; 
95% CI, -8.91 to -0.12 U/l; I2
=63%) compared to placebo or 
diet and exercise (Fig. 4B). In the subgroup analysis, signifi￾cant differences were observed in the metformin and control 
groups in NAFLD (MD, -2.62 U/l; I2
=0%; P=0.05), but not in 
NASH patients (MD, -6.69 U/l; P=0.33), although analysis of 
the latter subgroup showed a marked heterogeneity (I2
=78%).
HOMA‑IR. HOMA‑IR activity was reported in eight 
studies, showing a modest reduction in metformin‑treated 
patients (MD, -0.61; 95% CI, -1.04 to -0.19; I2
=21%; P=0.005) 
(Fig. 4C). However, in the subgroup analysis, statistically 
significant differences were only found in NAFLD (MD, 
-0.51; I2
=34%; P=0.04) but not in NASH patients (MD, -1.47; 
I
2
=0%; P=0.07).
BMI. A noteworthy benefit of metformin therapy vs. the 
control was observed on BMI (MD, -0.82 kg/m2
; 95% CI, -1.61 
to -0.03 kg/m2
; I2
=0%; P=0.04) (Fig. 4D). In the subgroup 
analysis of NASH, the mean reduction in BMI was modest and 
statistically not significant (MD, -0.53 kg/m2
, I2
=0%; P=0.36).
Adverse events. Of the nine studies, only four provided 
detailed information on gastrointestinal side‑effects, such 
as gas, bloating and mild abdominal pain (n=17, 8.5%)

in the metformin group (20,22,25,28). In their study, 
Haukeland et al (20) reported that only one patient had devel￾oped exanthema. However, none of the patients discontinued 
metformin due to intolerance during treatment.
Discussion
In this systematic review, nine randomized clinical trials were 
included, six of which were on NAFLD and three on NASH. 
The nine trials had a small sample size and a high variability 
of group size (ranging from 19 to 82 participants). A total of 
417 participants were enrolled. A number of patients were 
overweight or had diabetes. Two trials were considered to be 
of high methodological quality (20,21), in terms of alloca￾tion sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding 
and outcome data. The remaining seven trials (22-28) were 
inadequate or unclear in at least one of the five components 
used to assess methodological quality. Considerable hetero￾geneity, such as inclusion criteria, sample sizes, duration of 
treatment and methods of outcome assessment were present 
in these trials. Thus, the adequacy of this evidence should be 
considered carefully.
The effect of metformin on liver histology remains 
unclear. Our findings demonstrate that metformin does not 
improve the condition of NAFLD or NASH patients with the 
histological spectrum of steatosis, inflammation, hepatocel￾lular ballooning and fibrosis, consistent with the findings of 
previously published systematic studies (17,29,30). The current 
data should be interpreted objectively and dialectically. First, 
although the nine studies assessed the effect of metformin on 
histological response, five studies could not be included in the 
histological response analyses, due to the fact that three of them 
provided insufficient data and two employed US as the means 
of diagnosis. Furthermore, the histopathologic grading system 
was different in the four included studies, inevitably resulting 
in heterogeneity. The two studies assessing hepatic steatosis 
by US also suggested that metformin had no significant effect 
on hepatic steatosis. Although perfect evidence is absent, the 
studies included in this review demonstrate that metformin has 
no effect on histological response in NAFLD.
Regarding the liver enzymes, there were eight and nine 
studies assessing the effect of metformin on ALT and AST, 
respectively. Overall, they showed a statistically significant 
reduction in ALT and AST levels in the metformin group. 
Certain reviews (31,32) have shown improvements in liver 
enzymes only in the single‑arm trails. However, this has not 
yet been confirmed by data obtained from RCTs. Therefore, 
our findings may be more objective and reliable. In the NASH 
subgroup analysis, the metformin group had a tendency to 
exhibit lower ALT and AST levels compared to the control 
group, although this tendency was not statistically significant 
(P=0.62 and 0.33). A number of the included studies reported 
Figure 4. Forest plots of improvement in biochemical and anthropometric variables are shown. (A) Alanine aminotransferase (ALT); (B) aspartate amino￾transferase (AST); (C) homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA‑IR) and (D) body mass index (BMI).

ALT to be a marker for hepatic inflammation. We found an 
average ALT reduction of 8.12 U/l. However, ALT should not 
be considered to be a marker for liver improvement, since 
improvement in liver tests is not correlated with histological 
findings (33,34).
IR was assessed using HOMA‑IR (20-24,26-28) and 
serum insulin levels, in eight and one study, respectively 
(25). As expected, insulin sensitivity markedly improved in 
the metformin, compared to the control group. In their study, 
Rakoski et al (17) reported that non‑diabetic patients may be 
particularly susceptible to the insulin‑sensitizing properties 
of glitazone and that early intervention may prevent wors￾ening of IR (35). However, our subgroup analysis detected no 
statistically significant differences between diabetic and non￾diabetic patients, suggesting only that the improving trend in 
HOMA‑IR was more obvious in NAFLD compared to NASH 
patients.
Due to the incomplete data on body weight, we calculated 
BMI instead and found a favourable response to metformin 
treatment in patients with NAFLD. This improvement in BMI 
was associated with an improvement in IR, as HOMA‑IR 
scores were markedly lower at the end of the included studies 
in the two groups. However, three included studies showed no 
improvement in BMI (21,26,28). The reason for this result is 
unclear, but may be associated with the relatively low dose in 
the three studies (mean dose of 0.76 g/day). Therefore, the dose 
or the duration of therapy should be more carefully determined 
in metformin treatment.
Our study had several limitations. First, the method￾ological limitations: the small number of patients, the lack 
of randomization and blinded measures and the incomplete 
histological outcomes. Second, although publication bias is 
a significant factor (assessed using funnel plots), it is unin￾formative due to the small number of studies available for 
our analysis. However, the included studies yielded nega￾tive results for an improvement in histological response. 
Third, meta‑analysis of weighting studies draws conclusions 
resulting in the largest variance for the pooled effect size. 
Thus, 95% CIs for the OR and MD are likely to be wider and 
more conservative than expected. We performed sensitivity 
analysis after excluding the studies that appeared as outliers 
in the forest plots, which did not have a significant impact on 
the results. Finally, the histopathologic grading system was 
inconsistent in the included studies, likely to have affected the 
accuracy of the data.
In the included studies, the duration of treatment ranged 
from 4 to 12 months (median duration, 8.5 months), and 
the dose of metformin ranged from 0.85 to 3 g/day (median 
dose, 1.5 g/day). Due to the limited number of the included 
studies, the optimal dose and the duration of therapy were 
difficult to determine. In addition, IR is widely considered to 
be a pivotal feature of NAFLD, which is strongly and inde￾pendently associated with the increased risk of type 2 diabetes 
(36,37). Although metformin has been used for the treatment 
of diabetes for >50 years, it has currently become one of the 
first‑line treatment options in the management of diabetes, 
and is recommended by a number of international guidelines 
and consensus (38). Metformin may therefore be used to treat 
NAFLD and diabetes simultaneously. Therefore, application of 
the optimal dose of metformin in order to decrease NAFLD￾associated risk of diabetes is a promising treatment approach. 
Further randomized clinical trails are required to confirm 
his hypothesis. This review shows that metformin has mild 
side‑effects, thus can be used safely for long periods of time, 
and that no patient discontinued metformin due to intolerance 
or side‑effects. However, we should be cautious about this 
conclusion, since evidence pointing towards important renal 
toxicity was reported in previous studies (39). The unexpected 
adverse events should be monitored carefully in future studies. 
Although we cannot determine the optimal dose and duration 
of therapy, the studies included in this review provide current 
available evidence on the beneficial as well as harmful effects 
of metformin in NAFLD.
Due to the heterogeneity of the inclusion criteria for 
patient enrollment, patients aged <18 years of age were 
excluded. However, several studies have evaluated the 
potential involvement of metformin in the therapy of pedi￾atric patients with NAFLD (40-42). Findings regarding 
pediatric patient population were similar to those regarding 
adults, supporting the beneficial effects of metformin on 
biochemical and metabolic, but not on histological response. 
Despite the fact that this systematic review shows no histo￾logical benefit and a modest biochemical and metabolic 
benefit of metformin, whether or not metformin should be 
widely used in clinical trials remains to be determined. 
Investigators and clinicians should be aware of this issue, 
since the changes in histology in NAFLD have been 
observed in larger studies with long follow-up periods. In 
this systematic review, the follow-up period of the included 
trials on average was 8.5 months. Since the sample size was 
small, RCTs with large sample sizes and a long follow‑up 
need to be conducted. The use of metformin might be 
limited to NAFLD to improve biochemical and metabolic 
features and might not be used for NASH. Furthermore, as 
metformin is less expensive compared to most other treat￾ment modalities for NAFLD, it is considered affordable for 
the affected population.
In summary, this systematic review has shown that 
metformin may not improve histological response, but it can 
improve biochemical and metabolic features in NAFLD. 
Therefore, metformin remains a promising drug for the treat￾ment of NAFLD due to its metabolic effects and safety profile. 
However, in the treatment of NASH, our subgroup analyses do 
not support this finding. RCTs with a low risk of bias need 
to be conducted in order to assess the beneficial or harmful 
effects of metformin on NAFLD or NASH. Moreover, RCTs 
with a large sample size and long follow‑up period should 
be designed. Furthermore, future studies should develop a 
uniform assessment method of liver biopsy and investigate the 
optimal dose and duration of metformin therapy to achieve 
the maximal sustainable effect.
