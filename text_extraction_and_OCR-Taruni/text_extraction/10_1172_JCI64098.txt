Aging is the largest risk factor for most chronic diseases, which account for the majority of morbidity and health 
care expenditures in developed nations. New findings suggest that aging is a modifiable risk factor, and it may be 
feasible to delay age-related diseases as a group by modulating fundamental aging mechanisms. One such mech￾anism is cellular senescence, which can cause chronic inflammation through the senescence-associated secretory 
phenotype (SASP). We review the mechanisms that induce senescence and the SASP, their associations with chronic 
disease and frailty, therapeutic opportunities based on targeting senescent cells and the SASP, and potential paths 
to developing clinical interventions.
Introduction
The world’s elderly population is growing rapidly. As people reach 
advanced age, they often face years of disability marked by multi￾ple chronic diseases, frailty, and loss of independence. This burden 
of disability threatens social and economic stability. A huge chal￾lenge for modern biomedical research is to compress, if not elim￾inate, this period of frailty and disability and to increase health 
span. How can this challenge be met?
Aging is a large, if not the leading, risk factor for most of the 
chronic conditions that limit survival, independence, and well-be￾ing (1). These chronic disorders, including atherosclerosis, most 
cancers, dementias, diabetes, and many others (Figure 1), become 
progressively more prevalent as the elderly population grows. A 
prime suspected cause of these prominent age-related disorders is 
the chronic, nonmicrobial inflammation that develops in multiple 
tissues. Hallmarks of inflammation, including elevated IL-6, TNF￾α, and immune cell chemokines, are associated with dementias (2), 
depression (3), atherosclerosis (4–8), cancers (9–11), diabetes (12–
14), and mortality (2, 15, 16). Inflammation is perhaps the most 
important physiologic correlate of the age-related frailty syndrome 
(17–20), which includes heightened vulnerability to stresses (e.g., 
surgery, infection, or trauma), coupled with muscle wasting (sar￾copenia) and cachexia/fat tissue loss, all of which become increas￾ingly common in old age (17–19, 21–29). Frailty predisposes to 
chronic disease, loss of independence, and mortality and greatly 
increases health costs (25, 27).
Until recently, the powerful association between age and chronic 
disease has mainly been noted with little hope of intervention. A 
critical roadblock to enhancing health span is the lack of effective 
treatments for age-related frailty and chronic diseases as a group. 
Currently available treatments (social supports, mobility aides, 
and “Band-Aid” treatments for end-stage, downstream symp￾toms) are not directed at the root causes of age-related dysfunc￾tion. Treating chronic diseases one at a time does not suffice (30). 
Calculations based on mortality data in the United States produce 
surprising predictions: if cancer was eliminated as a cause of death, 
average human life span would increase only 3%–4% (31). The same 
is true were ischemic heart disease to be “cured” (30). Yet caloric 
restriction, which retards broad basic aging processes by as yet 
incompletely understood mechanisms, extends life span in animal 
models, including mice, by much larger increments (32). Clearly, 
clinical practice would be transformed if mechanism-based treat￾ments could be devised that break the link between fundamental 
aging processes and chronic diseases, making aging a modifiable 
risk factor. The recent awareness that age-related disorders can be 
driven by one or more basic aging processes has inspired efforts to 
identify these processes and develop strategies, preferably pharma￾cological in nature, to intervene.
Cellular senescence
One basic process that may contribute to age-related dysfunction 
and chronic sterile inflammation is cellular senescence (Figure 
2). Cellular senescence refers to the essentially irreversible growth 
arrest that occurs when cells experience potentially oncogenic 
insults (33–38). There is now strong evidence that cellular senes￾cence is a potent anticancer mechanism (39–42). In contrast, 
despite its name, its discovery over 50 years ago, and increas￾ing data associating senescent cells with aging phenotypes and 
age-related pathology (43–50), evidence has only recently emerged 
showing that eliminating senescent cells can actually delay age-re￾lated dysfunction (51), at least in a progeroid mouse model. This 
finding still must be tested in chronologically aged models, but 
this is the first clear evidence that senescent cells are important 
drivers of multiple age-related pathologies. How cellular senes￾cence promotes age-related diseases, frailty, and dysfunction 
remains one of the important questions in the biology of aging 
and clinical geriatrics.
The abundance of senescent cells increases in multiple tissues 
with chronological aging and in progeroid syndromes (43, 47, 50, 
52–55). Several processes have been identified that cause or are 
associated with cellular senescence, all of which also increase with 
age (Figure 3). Senescence-causing inducers include repeated cell 
division and strong mitogenic signals, telomere shortening, DNA 
damage and mutations, protein aggregation, and increased ROS 
(46, 56–60). These insults activate the p53 and p16INK4a tumor 
suppressor pathways and potentially other pathways that initiate 
a senescence response. Once initiated, senescence takes days to 
weeks to become fully established and irreversible. The process 
is reinforced by an intracellular signaling loop including ROS 
linked to DNA damage responses (DDRs), NFκB, and trans￾forming growth factor-β, as well as an IL-1α, IL-6, and CCAAT

enhancer binding protein-β (C/EBP-β) loop (59, 61–64). Senes￾cent cells reorganize chromatin, resulting in heterochromatin for￾mation, extensive gene expression changes, increased cell size and 
protein content, and changes in cell and organelle shape (55, 65, 
66). Senescent cells are metabolically active, relatively resistant to 
apoptosis, and appear to be removed by the immune system (33, 
67, 68). Senescence is effectively a cell fate that, like replication, 
differentiation, or apoptosis, can occur at any point in life.
A common feature of aging tissues is low-level chronic inflam￾mation, termed sterile inflammation (indicating an absence 
of detectable pathogens) or inflammaging (69–72). Chronic 
inflammation can drive pathology by at least two mechanisms. 
First, infiltrating immune cells can degrade tissues because 
they release reactive or toxic moieties. Second, inflammatory 
cytokines can provoke phenotypic changes that are indepen￾dent of the immune system in nearby cells. For example, IL-6 
and IL-8 can stimulate angiogenesis, disrupt cell-cell commu￾nication, impede macrophage function, induce innate immune 
responses, and promote epithelial and endothelial cell migra￾tion and invasion (73–79).
Little is known about the source of the sterile inflammation 
that fuels most major age-related diseases, including degen￾erative pathologies, such as loss of brain function, as well as 
hyperproliferative pathologies, such as cancer. This chronic 
inflammation may derive partly from an age-related decline 
in homeostatic immune function or resistance to endoge￾nous microbes. Chronic inflammation may also derive in part 
from senescent cells: senescent cells secrete proinflammatory 
cytokines, chemokines, and proteases, termed the senescence-as￾sociated secretory phenotype (SASP) (80, 81).
SASP
The SASP is primarily a DDR (82). The SASP, through the 
inflammatory, growth-promoting, and remodeling factors that 
it produces, can potentially explain how senescent cells alter tis￾sue microenvironments, attract immune cells, and, ironically, 
induce malignant phenotypes in nearby cells. Proteins that are 
associated with the SASP, such as TNF-α, IL-6, MMPs, monocyte 
chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), and IGF binding proteins 
(IGFBPs), increase in multiple tissues with chronological aging 
(64), and occur in conjunction with sterile inflammation. Fur￾thermore, expression of the SASP components, IL-6, IGFBP-2, 
and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, is much higher in 
p16INK4a-positive senescent cells isolated directly from fat tissue 
of older progeroid mice compared with nonsenescent cells from 
the same tissue (51). This finding suggests that the SASP is the 
main driver of age-related inflammation, at least in fat tissue 
under certain conditions. Thus, selective elimination of senes￾cent cells or their effects might be a means to reduce age-related 
sterile chronic inflammation, enhance health span, and interrupt 
the link between aging and chronic disease.
Cellular senescence is a double-edged sword. Central to under￾standing how senescent cells could have positive and negative 
effects on organismal health are two concepts. The first is antag￾onistic pleiotropy. This element of the evolutionary theory of 
aging predicts the existence of processes that were selected to 
ensure early life fitness (e.g., protection from cancer by promoting 
immune responses), but have unselected deleterious effects late in 
life that cause aging phenotypes and pathology (83).
The second concept is the SASP, which can have positive or neg￾ative effects, depending on context. The SASP can cause local and 
potentially systemic inflammation, disrupt tissue architecture, and 
stimulate growth of nearby malignant cells when the SASP is both 
pronounced or persistent, as in old age, massive obesity, or pro￾gerias (65, 84–88). Conversely, a localized, time-limited SASP may 
be important in resolving tissue damage, at least in younger indi￾viduals, an example of antagonistic pleiotropy. The SASP might 
alert nearby cells to potential danger and promote immune clear￾ance of the damaged cells (67, 68, 89). Furthermore, SASP MMPs 
limit fibrosis following liver injury or during skin wound healing 
(68, 90, 91), which is beneficial. The SASP cytokines, IL-6 and IL-8, 
also reinforce the senescence growth arrest, at least in some senes￾cent cells (62, 63), which is beneficial in defense against cancer. 
However, these cytokines can also cause epithelial-to-mesenchymal 
Figure 1
Aging is the leading risk factor for most serious chronic diseases and 
disabilities, including strokes, heart disease, cancers, dementias, oste￾oporosis, arthritis, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, kidney failure, blind￾ness, and frailty.
Figure 2
A disruption of the intersection between fundamental aging mech￾anisms and processes that lead to chronic diseases may delay age￾related diseases and disabilities as a group and thereby lengthen health 
span. The increasing burden of senescent cells might contribute to the 
early etiology of age-related diseases and accelerate progression of 
these diseases following their initiation. Chronic disease pathology, 
coupled with the spread of senescence to neighboring healthy cells, 
might further drive cellular senescence, thus contributing to a spiral of 
increasing inflammation and dysfunction. Among other possibilities, 
chronic inflammation associated with the SASP, combined with with 
inflammation from preclinical and overt chronic disease, may predis￾pose to frailty, sarcopenia, and eventually mortality.

transitions, which promote cancer (77, 78). Conceivably, the SASP 
could play a role in defense against infections or other insults, pos￾sibilities that need to be studied. Remarkably, though, continuous 
clearance of senescent cells for over 9 months did not have overt 
adverse effects, but rather enhanced health span and function, at 
least in progeroid mice housed in an animal facility (51).
An intracellular IL-1α / miR-146a/b / IL-6 / C/EBP-β loop as 
well as related p38/NF-κB– and mTOR-mediated pathways appear 
to contribute to the changes in gene expression that result in the 
SASP (Figure 2 and refs. 61–64, 92–94). SASP components include 
proteins that are generally conserved across cell types, although 
differences exist among cell types (81) and presumably across tis￾sues, a speculation that needs further testing. Very little is known 
about the contribution, if any, of nonprotein factors such as nucle￾otides, bradykines, prostenoids, ceramides, or ROS to effects of the 
SASP. The composition of the SASP may vary as time progresses 
after the initiation of senescence and might partly depend on the 
mechanism through which senescence is induced. In support of 
this possibility, senescence induced by oncogenic RAS, p16INK4a
overexpression, or p53 activity is associated with variability in both 
the quality and extent of SASP protein secretion (81, 95). Thus, 
while we speak of the SASP, it is unlikely that there is a singular 
SASP. Rather, the amounts of SASP components released depend 
on cell context. For example, in senescent human fibroblastoid 
keratocytes in the eye, IL-6 is actually decreased (96). Studies are 
required to delineate upstream mechanisms causing the SASP, 
explore differences in the SASP among cell types, and elucidate 
the nature of the SASP in primary senescent cells in vivo rather 
than in cell culture.
Whether the SASP causes chronic age-related diseases needs to 
be determined in vivo. Testing of this possibility is now under￾way using mice from which senescent cells can be selectively 
removed (51) that are bred with mouse models of human age-re￾lated chronic diseases or that are treated with various dietary and 
other interventions. The SASP also appears to spread from cell to 
cell (97), potentially amplifying the senescent cell burden, sterile 
inflammation, and chronic disease progression, especially once 
the capacity of the immune system to remove senescent cells is 
overwhelmed. The mechanisms and consequences of spreading 
senescence merit further investigation.
The SASP likely has wide-ranging relationships with the immune 
system. Immune system elements, especially innate immune 
responses involving macrophage infiltration, are involved in 
clearing senescent cells (67, 98–100). Macrophage chemokines, 
Figure 3
A number of inducers can act alone or in combination to push cells 
into the senescent cell fate through pathways involving p16INK4a/Rb, 
p53/p21, and likely other pathways. Triggers may include DNA dam￾age (e.g., telomere shortening and single- and double-strand breaks); 
oncogenic mutations (e.g., Ras, Myc, B-Raf); reactive metabolites 
(e.g., ROS, ceramides, fatty acids, high glucose); high mitogen and 
nutrient signals that increase mTOR activity; and proteotoxic stress 
(e.g., protein aggregation and unfolded proteins). These may contribute 
to widespread changes in gene expression and chromatin remodel￾ing (heterochromatin formation) that underlie senescence-associ￾ated growth arrest, the SASP, and changes in morphology. In these 
respects, cellular senescence can be viewed as a cell fate reminis￾cent of differentiation, replication, or apoptosis (external and internal 
inducers, transcription factor cascades, gene expression changes 
and chromatin remodeling, leading to changes in function). Evidence 
is better for some of the initiators and mediators of senescence than 
for others, and future research is likely to uncover additional initiators 
and mediators. Intracellular autocrine loops reinforce progression to 
irreversible replicative arrest, heterochromatin formation, and initiation 
of the SASP over a matter of days to weeks. In addition to removing 
cells from the progenitor/stem cell pool, senescence may contribute 
to tissue dysfunction and chronic disease predisposition through the 
SASP and associated chronic sterile inflammation and degradation of 
the extracellular matrix.

including MCP-1, are prominent components of the SASP (64, 
81). However, tissue macrophage responses appear to decline with 
aging (101), potentially contributing to senescent cell accumula￾tion in old age. A high burden of senescent cells could interfere 
with immune function. Consistent with this speculation, chronic 
exposure to IL-6 inhibits macrophage function (102) and SASP 
proteases could cleave FAS ligand or other cell surface proteins 
required for effective immune function. More insight is needed into 
how senescent cells affect the immune system and are removed by 
it. The speculation that reducing senescent cell burden could actu￾ally enhance immune responses to pathogens needs to be tested.
Interventions targeting cellular senescence and the SASP
Potential strategies for mitigating the deleterious effects of senes￾cent cells include interfering with pathways that lead to senes￾cence-associated growth arrest, eliminating senescent cells, and 
interfering with the adverse effects of senescent cells by targeting 
the SASP. The first strategy could be problematic if the mecha￾nisms through which cellular senescence defends against cancer 
are compromised. Interfering with pathways that can induce 
senescence-associated replicative arrest are likely to promote can￾cer, as occurs when p16INK4a, the retinoblastoma (Rb) protein, or 
p53 is diminished or inactivated (67, 103). On the other hand, 
strategies that delay senescent cell accumulation by reducing 
progenitor turnover, metabolic damage, or other processes that 
can cause cell damage might be beneficial. For example, caloric 
restriction delays cellular senescence (104) and could exert part of 
its beneficial effect on health span through doing so, a speculation 
that merits further testing.
The second approach, eliminating already-formed senescent cells, 
may not only reduce tissue inflammation and organ dysfunction 
but might also reduce cancer risk. Cells can become senescent when 
they harbor potentially oncogenic mutations. Furthermore, senes￾cent cells can promote malignant transformation in neighboring 
cells in mouse xenografts (86), possibly through SASP-induced 
inflammation and tissue MMP and mitogen secretion. Indeed, 
health span was enhanced by clearing senescent cells in progeroid 
mice, without interfering with anticarcinogenic pathways upstream 
of senescence (51). Because terminally differentiated cells share 
some properties of senescent cells such as growth arrest, we were 
concerned that targeting senescent cells in INK-ATTAC mice might 
damage cells like neurons. However, terminally differentiated cells 
did not appear to be disrupted to the point of causing symptoms, 
even after over a year of continuous senescent cell removal.
The third approach, preventing development of the SASP or 
ameliorating its effects, could also enhance function and reduce 
inflammation and cancer risk, albeit without the finality of actu￾ally eliminating the senescent cells that potentially harbor can￾cerous lesions. Ideally, ameliorating the SASP would be achieved 
without interfering with senescence-associated anti-oncogenic 
pathways or undoing growth arrest.
Eliminating senescent cells may be possible in humans. The 
distinct morphology, secreted protein patterns, and gene expres￾sion profiles of senescent cells support the feasibility of doing so. 
At least two approaches can be envisaged for removing senescent 
cells: the use of antibodies to specifically target senescent cells 
or the development of small molecules to selectively kill them. 
Other approaches might include viral-based nucleotide delivery 
or vaccines. The antibody approach would entail developing bio￾logicals that recognize epitopes that are more highly expressed 
by senescent compared with nonsenescent cells, coupled to a 
cytolytic agent. This approach has been difficult in the cancer 
field and could also be problematic with respect to eliminating 
senescent cells. However, unlike for cancer interventions, com￾plete elimination of senescent cells may not be necessary for 
achieving beneficial effects. Thus, targeting epitopes that differ 
quantitatively between senescent and nonsenescent cells may 
be reasonable, without needing to discover epitopes that are 
uniquely present on senescent cells.
The small-molecule approach could be based on high-through￾put, cell-based screens of chemical libraries to discover “drug￾gable” molecules that kill senescent cells with greater selectivity 
than nonsenescent cells. Alternatively, molecular target–based 
high-throughput screens focused on pathways identified 
through expression, proteomic, or metabolomic analyses of 
senescent versus nonsenescent cells may work. These small-mol￾ecule approaches could also be adapted to targeting the SASP, as 
opposed to killing senescent cells. Using one of these approaches, 
it was discovered that glucocorticoids ameliorate the SASP (105).
Developing interventions to target senescent cells or the SASP 
will be a tall order. Possibly, combinations of approaches will be 
required. Because senescent cells do not divide, they are unlikely to 
develop drug resistance, a problem encountered with compounds 
that target dividing cancer cells or microbes. Also, finding com￾pounds or antibodies that target 100% of senescent cells and 0% 
of normal cells might not be necessary to achieve clinical benefit. 
Thus, it may be feasible to discover agents that target senescent 
cells or the SASP and test them in aged animals to determine 
whether they reproduce the beneficial effects of removing senes￾cent cells from genetically engineered progeroid mice.
Clinical trials strategies
Designing clinical trials to test the effectiveness of agents that 
target senescent cells is a challenge (106). Clearly, studying effects 
on human life span or health span is not feasible within a real￾istic time frame. Drugs that must be given early in life to have 
a beneficial effect in old age would also be nearly impossible to 
translate into clinical application. Such drugs would need to have 
virtually no side effects over years to decades. The time required 
for clinical trials would be prohibitive. Senolytic drugs would need 
to be developed for subjects who already have symptoms or who 
are guaranteed to develop them within a short time (e.g., patients 
with progerias or members of families who carry mutations caus￾ing early-onset Alzheimer’s disease that have essentially complete 
penetrance). Readily measurable outcome parameters would need 
to be devised and accepted by regulatory authorities.
We envisage several potential clinical trial scenarios. Based on 
these, it may be reasonable to work backward to design drug 
screens and animal testing strategies. One scenario would be to 
target specific age-related chronic diseases in which senescence 
plays an etiologic role and in which eliminating senescent cells or 
SASP components would result in a rapidly detectable, clinically 
meaningful response. For example, effects of senolytics on ame￾liorating peripheral insulin resistance in obese subjects could be 
tested because massive obesity is associated with fat tissue senes￾cent cell accumulation and elevated levels of circulating SASP-re￾lated cytokines that cause insulin resistance (56, 85). Another 
example would be to test whether progression of cancers that 
have failed conventional treatment is prevented, based on the 
contribution of senescent cells to cancer progression in xenograft

models (86). Other possibilities include testing whether senolytics 
enhance the resolution of atherosclerotic lesions, osteoarthritis, 
or fracture nonunion, conditions that are associated with focal 
senescent cell accumulation (107–109). These conditions might 
be amenable to local treatment, possibly by injection of senolytic 
agents. The effects of senolytics on the progression of dementia 
could be tested in longer clinical trials (lasting months rather than 
weeks) because Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias are asso￾ciated with senescent cell accumulation at sites of brain pathol￾ogy (reviewed in ref. 110). Of course, all these approaches would 
first need to be thoroughly vetted in proof-of-principle, preclinical 
studies in appropriate disease-specific animal models (preferably 
in old rather than young genetically modified animals, so that the 
aging tissue microenvironment is reproduced).
Another scenario is to target the frailty syndrome, which is asso￾ciated with systemic inflammation (17–20) and potentially the 
SASP. Trials can be envisaged in borderline frail subjects (with 
intermediate Fried or Rockwood scores; refs. 25, 27, 28) who are 
about to undergo medical procedures that increase inflamma￾tion and/or cellular senescence and that might push subjects 
into overt frailty or delirium. These procedures might include, 
for example, chemotherapy (particularly DNA-damaging agents), 
radiotherapy, bone marrow transplantation, and anesthesia/elec￾tive surgery. In these situations, senolytic treatment for a period 
before (but not during) the medical procedure might have a mea￾surable effect on time to recovery of symptom scores, strength, 
or cognition. These possibilities need to be tested first in animal 
models such as the INK-ATTAC mouse, in which senescent cells 
can be quantified because of a fluorescent marker and can be 
selectively eliminated in an inducible manner (51).
Research issues
Issues that need to be addressed before moving senolytics into 
clinical application include the development of biomarkers of 
senescent cell burden/SASP activity, identification of any adverse 
consequences of targeting senescent cells, and determination of 
when to begin treatment and whether intermittent or contin￾uous treatment is optimal. Blood biomarkers of senescent cell 
burden, perhaps based on detecting SASP products, would facil￾itate clinical trials. These biomarkers could be calibrated using 
a gold standard — for example, INK-ATTAC mice that have had 
senescent cells removed, senescent cell abundance in fat tissue 
biopsies, or whole body senescent cell counts at necropsy. Thor￾ough testing of whether senescent cell removal impairs response 
to infection, wound healing, scarring, or other functions must 
be conducted in animals and eventually humans. Intermittent 
rather than continuous senescent cell elimination during peri￾ods of relatively good health could remove potentially precan￾cerous senescent cells and reduce chronic inflammation due to 
the SASP, yet minimize potential adverse effects of senescent cell 
clearance. This approach might be more attractive than amelio￾rating the SASP, which may need to be done continuously, unlike 
removal of senescent cells.
Presumably, clinical trials of senolytics will be done in elderly 
subjects as well as younger subjects with diseases associated with 
cellular senescence and inflammation, such as diabetes in massive 
obesity. However, elderly subjects are not often included in clinical 
trials, and their study presents special clinical and logistical chal￾lenges. There are few geriatricians who have both a deep familiarity 
with the basic biology of aging and experience in conducting tri￾als of investigational new drugs (INDs). Further, few clinical trial 
investigators with IND experience have training in geriatrics and a 
deep understanding about the particular needs of elderly subjects 
or outcomes relevant to elderly populations. There is an urgent 
need to build teams of basic scientists in the biology of aging, geri￾atricians, and clinical trial investigators. In the longer term, there is 
a need to train investigators who can lead efforts to translate find￾ings from the basic biology of aging into clinical application (106).
Conclusion
If the premise is correct that targeting senescent cells or the SASP 
can delay or prevent multiple age-related chronic diseases as a 
group, rather than one at a time, and if this premise can be trans￾lated into clinical treatments, we are cautiously optimistic that 
health care as we know it might be transformed.
