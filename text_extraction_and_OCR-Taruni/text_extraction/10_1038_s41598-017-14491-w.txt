Genes expressed in mitochondria work in concert with those expressed in the nucleus to mediate 
oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), a process that is relevant for muscle metabolism and meat 
quality. Mitochondrial genome activity can be efficiently studied and compared in Duroc and Pietrain 
pigs, which harbor different mitochondrial haplotypes and distinct muscle fiber types, mitochondrial 
respiratory activities, and fat content. Pietrain pigs homozygous-positive for malignant hyperthermia 
susceptibility (PiPP) carried only haplotype 8 and showed the lowest absolute mtDNA copy number 
accompanied by a decrease transcript abundance of mitochondrial-encoded subunits ND1, ND6, and 
ATP6 and nuclear-encoded subunits NDUFA11 and NDUFB8. In contrast, we found that haplotype 4 
of Duroc pigs had significantly higher mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy numbers and an increase 
transcript abundance of mitochondrial-encoded subunits ND1, ND6, and ATP6. These results suggest 
that the variation in mitochondrial and nuclear genetic background among these animals has an effect 
on mitochondrial content and OXPHOS system subunit expression. We observed the co-expression 
pattern of mitochondrial and nuclear encoded OXPHOS subunits suggesting that the mitochondrial￾nuclear crosstalk functionally involves in muscle metabolism. The findings provide valuable information 
for understanding muscle biology processes and energy metabolism, and may direct use for breeding 
strategies to improve meat quality and animal health.
Mitochondria are involved in many key cellular processes such as apoptosis, calcium homeostasis, reactive oxy￾gen species production, and most importantly, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) generation by oxidative phospho￾rylation (OXPHOS). In addition, these organelles contain their own DNA distinct from the nuclear genome. In 
pigs, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is 16,613 base pairs in length and encodes two ribosomal RNA (rRNA), 22 
transfer RNA (tRNA), and 13 protein-coding genes involved in the OXPHOS system. Since OXPHOS subunits 
are encoded by both the nuclear and mitochondrial genome, the two genome systems interact intricately to form 
the fully assembled functional OXPHOS complexes.
Mitochondrial genetic variation can affect fertility, longevity, and evolutionary trajectories and acts as a 
human health indicator1
. mtDNA haplotype variation affects metabolic performance in many species, such as 
raccoons, dogs, cows, and pigs2
, and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number has been associated with exten￾sive exercise, age-related hearing impairment, disordered antioxidant capacity, and heart failure3–6
. In Drosophila, 
mtDNA copy number is proposed to be modulated by mtDNA genome variation7
. Mitochondrial DNA haplo￾types are potential targets for manipulating phenotypes including tolerance to heat, growth, and milk quality in 
farm animals8
. Hence, an understanding of the influence of mitochondrial haplotypes on energy metabolism in 
pigs would provide valuable information on mitochondrial function and inform farming practices to improve

meat quality and animal health. Since pigs share many similarities with humans in terms of genetics and physiol￾ogy, this knowledge is also potentially applicable to human diseases.
In addition to variation in mitochondrial density among muscle types, mitochondria are functionally opti￾mized and specialized in glycolytic and oxidative fibers9
. Mitochondria isolated from muscle immediately after 
slaughter are similar to those found in intact muscle, whereas some mitochondria from pale, soft, exudative 
(PSE) muscle are already swollen and show a decreased matrix density10. With an emphasis placed on glycolysis, 
mitochondrial content and function may be important factors contributing to postmortem muscle metabolism11. 
Duroc and Pietrain are two commercial pig breeds known for divergent meat quality and muscular energy metab￾olism. Muscle from Duroc pigs typically contains more slow-twitch oxidative (STO) fibers and intramuscular 
fat, whereas Pietrain pigs are leaner and their muscles contain more fast-twitch glycolytic (FTG) fibers12–14. The 
content of different muscle fibers types, their size and structure largely contribute to differences in growth per￾formance and carcass traits as well as postmortem meat quality traits15. Lipids are stored mainly in STO fibers, 
which can improve the tenderness and juiciness of the meat16. The selection of a high percentage of FTG fibers 
may result in altered meat quality possibly due to the lower capillarization, insufficient delivery of oxygen and 
glycogen depletion17,18. Indeed, the meat quality parameters such as color of the meat, drip loss and shear force 
were measured in muscle of the same pigs12,14. PiPP pigs showed increased drip loss and shear force comparing 
to other three pig breeds. These results directly supported the association between muscle fiber type and meat 
quality. In Pietrain pigs, mutations within the ryanodine receptor 1 (RYR1) are associated with malignant hyper￾thermia susceptibility (MHS), reduced water holding capacity, and increased PSE meat19–21. Thus, Duroc and 
Pietrain pigs are unique models in which to study mitochondrial properties and energy metabolism influencing 
muscle metabolism and meat quality.
We have previously shown the transcriptional signatures in muscle from these pigs to be related to metabolic 
properties and mitochondrial respiration22–24. Furthermore, we wanted to know the mtDNA variation of these 
pigs and investigate whether mtDNA variation preferentially modifies the expression of mitochondria-associated 
OXPHOS gene from both mitochondria and nuclear genomes. Finally, we investigated mtDNA variation genes 
involved in mtDNA copy number in conjunction with muscle fiber types and metabolic enzyme activities in 
postmortem longissimus muscles (LM) from four different pig breeds: Duroc, Pietrain homozygous-negative 
for MHS (PiNN), Pietrain homozygous-positive for MHS (PiPP), and an F2 crossbred Duroc-Pietrain 
homozygous-negative for MHS (DuPi).
Results
Phenotypic differences among breeds. To illustrate breed differences in muscle metabolism, muscle 
fiber composition, metabolic activities, and pH were compared among the four breeds. Duroc pigs had the high￾est percentage of STO muscle fibers and lower fast-twitch oxidative (FTO) fibers (Supplementary Fig. S1). PiPP 
pigs had a significantly higher percentage of FTG fibers (80.8%) compared to PiNN pigs (74.9%, p=0.02), while 
Duroc and DuPi were in between the two Pietrain pigs.
The activities of key metabolic enzymes for energy metabolism were measured for all four pig breeds. PiNN 
pigs had the highest activity of phosphofructokinase (PFK), whereas no significant differences in the activities of 
glycogen phosphorylase (GP) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were detected among breeds. Duroc pigs had the 
highest complex I activity (12.5 U/g protein) compared to other breeds. Moreover, PiPP had significantly lower 
pH than the other three breeds.
All measured phenotypic traits were compared at time 0 and 30min postmortem (Supplementary Fig. S2). 
Most of the phenotypes, except complex IV activity, were significantly different between time points. The enzyme 
activities of PFK and LDH were increased from 475 to 859 U/g protein (p=0.0002) and from 10.9 to 15 U/g pro￾tein (p<0.0001), respectively, whereas the oxidative enzyme activities of CS, complex I and complex II, together 
with GP activity and pH, were decreased at 30min postmortem compared to immediately after slaughter (p values 
ranging from<0.0001 to 0.02).
Different mitochondrial haplotypes among pig breeds. The D-loop regions in 53 animals were 
sequenced and eight haplotypes were identified. For statistical reasons, five haplotypes identified in at least three 
animals were included in subsequent data analysis. Detailed haplotype information is shown in Supplementary 
Table 1 and Fig. S3. In brief, haplotypes 4 (Duroc: 10, DuPi: 6) and 6 (Duroc: 5, DuPi: 1) were present in mainly 
Duroc and DuPi pigs whereas haplotype 1 was present in five DuPi pigs only. Haplotype 7 was present in three 
PiNN pigs, while haplotype 8 was found in 14 PiPP and four PiNN pigs. Muscles from pigs with haplotype 7 
contained significantly more FTO muscle fibers than haplotypes 4, 6, and 8 (p<0.05, Fig. S4). Interestingly, hap￾lotype 8 showed the lowest complex I activity among all the haplotypes and had significantly lower activity than 
haplotypes 4 and 6 (p<0.05). All other phenotypic traits were comparable between haplotypes.
Duplication of the porcine mitochondrial genome in the nuclear genome. Using BLASTN, the pig 
mitochondrial genome was compared to the pig nuclear genome. Many regions among 18 somatic chromosomes 
and the X chromosome of the porcine nuclear genome matched to the mitochondrial genome (Fig. 1).
Comparison of mtDNA copy number. PiPP pigs had the lowest mtDNA copy number (368 copies per 
nuclear genome) among the four breeds, especially compared to Duroc pigs (435 copies per nuclear genome, 
p = 0.02, Fig. 2a). Further, mtDNA copy number in longissimus muscle was decreased from 420 copies per 
nuclear genome at 0 min postmortem to 389 copies at 30 min postmortem (p=0.01, Fig. 2b). Finally, muscle 
from pigs with haplotype 8 contained the lowest mtDNA copy number. Pigs with haplotype 8 had 375 copies per 
nuclear genome in their muscle tissue, which was significantly less than the 435 copies per nuclear genome seen 
in pigs with haplotype 4 (p=0.02, Fig. 2c). There were no significant effects of sex on mtDNA copy number.

Correlation between mtDNA copy number, phenotype, and gene expression. As shown in 
Fig. 2d, mtDNA copy number was significantly correlated with muscle fiber type (STO: r=0.263 p=0.031; FTG: 
r=−0.292 p=0.017) and enzyme activities (CS: r=0.249 p=0.009; complex I: r=0.43 p=<0.0001). Moreover, 
the expression of mitochondria-encoded genes (ND1, CYB, COX1, and ATP6) and nuclear-encoded OXPHOS 
genes (NDUFA3, NDUFA11, NDUFA13, NDUFB8, NDUFS8, NDUFV1, ATP5G1, and ATP5L) were significantly 
correlated with mtDNA copy number (p values ranged from 0.006 to 0.031 and<0.0001 to 0.015, respectively. 
MtDNA copy number was weakly correlated with PPARG coactivator 1 alpha (PGC-1α) mRNA (p=0.156).
Comparison of mitochondrial and nuclear encoded OXPHOS genes expression. To further 
examine breed and time differences in postmortem muscular energy metabolism at a molecular level, both mito￾chondrial and nuclear encoded gene expression was profiled at 0 and 30 min postmortem using qPCR in all 
four pig breeds. No mitochondrial-encoded genes were differently expressed between 0 and 30min postmortem 
(Table 1). The mRNA levels of 4 nuclear-encoded genes, NDUFB8, COX7A2 and ATP5L were significantly lower 
at 30min postmortem than 0min (p values<0.0001 to 0.02).
Out of the sixteen genes investigated, ten genes including mitochondrial-encoded ND1, ND2, ND6, ATP6
were differently expressed between breeds (Fig. 3a). PiPP pigs had the most differentially expressed genes, espe￾cially compared to the Duroc and DuPi breeds: complex I subunits ND1 and ND6 and the ATP synthase subunit 
ATP6 were all significantly upregulated in Duroc pigs (p values<0.0001 to 0.003). Nuclear-encoded NDUFA11, 
NDUFB8, NDUFS8, NDUFV1, ATP5G1 and ATP5L showed significant differences among breeds (p< 0.05, 
Supplementary Table 2) (Fig. 3b). All six differentially expressed were down-regulated in PiPP pigs compared to 
the three other breeds.
Eleven genes including ND1, ND2, ND6, CYB, COX1, ATP6 and nuclear-encoded NDUFA11, NDUFA13, 
NDUFB8, ATP5G1 and ATP5L showed significant differences in haplotypes (Supplementary Table 3). Only three 
genes including nuclear-encoded NDUFB8, COX7A2 and ATP5L demonstrated that they were significantly influ￾enced by time. No gene expression was affected by sex.

All PiPP pigs had haplotype 8, which showed significantly lower gene expression than haplotypes 1, 4, and 6 
for ND1, ND2, ND6, CYB, COX1, and ATP6 (p values from p<0.0001 to 0.048; Fig. 4a and b). Complex I subunits 
NDUFA11, NDUFA13, and NDUFB8 showed significantly lower gene expression in haplotype 8 than haplotype 1 
pigs (p values<0.0001 to 0.029, Fig. 4c and d).

Correlation between expression levels of mitochondrial, nuclear encoded genes and pheno- type. Pairwise correlation was calculated and plotted for each individual OXPHOS gene (Fig. 5a). All included 
genes were significantly correlated with at least one of the other genes. Further, all mitochondrial-encoded 
OXPHOS subunits tended to be more tightly co-expressed while nuclear-encoded OXPHOS subunits were in a 
tight co-expressed relationship. Figure 5b shows the correlation between the expression of OXPHOS genes and 
phenotype. The expression of mitochondrial encoded OXPHOS subunits ND2, ND6, and ATP6 and the nuclear 
encoded subunit NDUFV1 were highly correlated with muscle fiber type (ND2: FTO r=−0.49 p=0.0002; ND6: 
STO r = 0.286 p = 0.042; ATP6: STO r= 0.342 p = 0.014; NDUFV1: FTG r= −0.346 p = 0.013). The nuclear 
encoded OXPHOS subunits NDUFA3, NDUFA11, NDUFB8, NDUFS8, and COX7A2 were significantly corre￾lated with at least one of the activities of oxidative enzymes CS, complex I, complex II, and complex IV. The 
expression of ND2 (r=−0.239 p=0.026) and ND6 (r=−0.221 p=0.04) were negatively correlated with PFK 
activity. The expression of NDUFB8 and COX7A2 were highly correlated with the activities of GP (NDUFB8: 
r=0.304 p=0.007; COX7A2: r=0.236 p=0.037), PFK (NDUFB8: r=−0.309 p=0.004; COX7A2: r=−0.305 
p=0.004), and LDH (NDUFB8: r=−0.354 p=0.001; COX7A2: r=−0.376 p=0.0003). The mRNA levels of 
ATP6, NDUFB8, COX7A2, and ATP5L were positively correlated with pH (p values<0.0001 to 0.028).
The expression of the master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative phosphorylation PGC-1a
was significantly correlated with the phenotypes of CS, complex I, complex II, complex IV, and pH (Table 2). 
The mRNA levels of PGC-1a were also significantly correlated with the expression of mitochondrial-encoded 
genes ND1, ND2, ND4, ND6, CYB, COX1, and ATP6. Among these genes, ATP6, ND6, and ND2 showed the top 
three most significant correlations with PGC-1a (ATP6: r=0.415 p<0.0001; ND6: r=0.372 p=0.0003; ND2: 
r=0.361p=0.0004). The expression of PGC-1a showed a significant correlation with the nuclear-encoded genes 
NUDFA11, NDUFA13, NDUFB8, COX7A2, ATP5G1, and ATP5L (p values<0.0001 to 0.036).

muscle phenotype. The effect of mitochondrial haplotypes on mitochondrial DNA copy number and OXPHOS 
gene expression were also examined since there were different haplotypes among the investigated pig breeds.
Muscle samples were collected from the fat-type Duroc pigs with a higher proportion of STO fibers and 
greater oxidative enzyme activities. Pietrain pigs are muscular and lean, and their muscles contain more FTG 
fibers. DuPi pig is a Duroc-Pietrain F2 crossbred. Mutations within ryanodine receptor 11 (RYR1) are frequently 
detected in Pietrain pigs. This leads to abnormal Ca2+ homeostasis and result in increased excitability of the 
muscle associated with MHS. This genetic defect consequently leads to reduction of water holding capacity, loss 
of stress resistance and PSE meat19–21.
Reduced mtDNA copy number in PiPP pigs. Previous studies have demonstrated the relative mtDNA 
copy number in porcine muscle25,26. In this study we quantified the absolute mtDNA copy number by qPCR and 
found that PiPP pigs contained the lowest amount of mtDNA copies in muscle cells compared to PiNN, DuPi, and 
particularly Duroc pigs. mtDNA copy number was positively correlated with STO fibers and negatively correlated 
with FTG fibers and indicated a strong association between mtDNA copy number and muscle fiber types.
The underlying cause of the mtDNA copy number variation between pig breeds remains unknown. In other 
case, changes in cytosolic Ca2+ and pH could influence the amount of ROS produced at the mitochondrial res￾piratory complex I and III27. The abnormal Ca2+ homeostasis in PiPP pigs may result in oxidative stress associated 
with elevated ROS production. The elevated ROS could increase mitophagy to remove damaged mitochondria 
and leads to mitochondrial degradation28,29. The copy number depletion associated with increased mitochon￾dria turnover is caused by a burst of ROS production30. Indeed, the burst of ROS and mtDNA depletion have 
been observed in cell-culture experiments. All together, these may partially explain the copy number variation of 
mtDNA in pig breeds. However, supporting evidence under physiological situation is still needed.
Decreased transcript levels of mitochondrial and nuclear encoded OXPHOS genes in PiPP 
pigs. Decreased abundance of many nuclear-encoded OXPHOS subunits transcripts was found in PiPP pigs 
compared to other breeds. This phenomenon is very likely caused by the abnormal Ca2+ homeostasis in PiPP pigs 
since MHS knock-in mice show a clear Ca2+ overload in the mitochondrial matrix and a switch to a compromised 
bioenergetics state characterized by low OXPHOS31. Similarly, transcript abundance of mitochondrial-encoded 
genes was decreased in PiPP pigs including subunits of complex I and ATP synthase. The previous study reported 
that ATP concentration has been significantly reduced in PiPP pigs compared to other breeds because of their 
accelerated energy consumption14. ATP sensing by transcriptional machinery has been proposed to regulate the

initiation of mitochondrial transcription and promotor usage32–34. Therefore, the lower ATP availability in PiPP 
pigs may influence their mitochondrial transcription and function.
Recent work has established that glucocorticoid receptor (GR) is translocated from cytosol to the mitochon￾dria and binds to the D-loop control region while stress and corticosteroids have a direct influence on hippocam￾pal mtDNA gene expression in rats35. Since RYR1 mutated PiPP pigs are stress susceptible, it is speculated that the 
abundance of mtDNA transcripts may be decreased in those pigs.

The early postmortem period had no effect on the expression of mitochondrial-encoded OXPHOS genes, 
but the mtDNA copy number was decreased from 0min to 30min postmortem. In other words, the early phase 
of hypoxia triggered mitochondrial genome instability while transcript abundance was maintained in porcine 
muscle. This disparity is of interest and might provide valuable information toward the understanding of mito￾chondrial mechanisms in muscle tissue under hypoxia, which has been linked to oxidative stress, ischemia, and 
cancer36. In addition, the identified postmortem mitochondrial properties are relevant to muscle injury, also 
caused by oxygen depletion37.
The effect of haplotype on mtDNA copy number and OXPHOS gene expression. Our study 
showed for the first time the effect of different mitochondrial haplotypes on muscle fiber types and mito￾chondrial respiration at both the phenotypic and molecular level in pigs. Among different haplotypes, our 
results showed variations in complex I activity and mtDNA copy number. At the molecular level, six of the 
mitochondrial-encoded and three of the nuclear-encoded OXHPOS genes were differentially expressed. These 
findings suggest that mitochondrial haplotypes could contribute to variations in mitochondrial content and 
OXPHOS system function.
The mitochondrial haplotype has been found to affect mtDNA copy number, OXPHOS respiration, and mito￾chondrial molecular function in Drosophila1,7,38. In porcine transmitochondrial cybrids, the mitochondrial haplo￾type is linked to metabolic traits including ROS production, ATP content, and complex II activity39. The assembly 
kinetics of OXPHOS complexes is proposed to be modulated by mitochondrial DNA background40.
Coordination of the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes contribute to phenotype. Our 
results showed that all mitochondrial-encoded OXPHOS subunits were highly co-expressed; moreover also the 
nuclear-encoded OXPHOS subunits tended to be in a tight co-expressed relationship. This observation reflects 
the fact that the mitochondrial genome has its own transcription machinery distinct from the nuclear genome. 
Although mitochondrial- and nuclear-encoded OXPHOS genes are expressed separately via different transcrip￾tion machineries in different cellular locations, they are not completely independent. The observed association 
between mitochondrial- and nuclear-encoded OXPHOS genes is in line with the theory of mitochondrial-nuclear 
crosstalk. PPARG coactivator 1 alpha (PGC-1α) is a nuclear-encoded transcription factor that acts as a mas￾ter coordinator to mediate mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative phosphorylation41. In this study, the mRNA 
level of PGC-1α significantly correlated with all investigated mitochondrial-encoded OXPHOS subunits, six 
nuclear-encoded subunits and enzyme activities of complex I, II, and IV. In fact, the nuclear-encoded subu￾nits need to be imported into the mitochondria together with mitochondrial-encoded subunits to form a fully 
assembled functional OXPHOS system in the mitochondrial inner membrane. Accordingly, the absence of the 
mtDNA-encoded subunits COX1 and COX2 has been shown to affect the stability of some subunits of nuclear 
encoded respiratory chain proteins42.
In our results, different mitochondrial haplotypes showed variation of the expression of 
mitochondrial-encoded subunits ND2, ND6 and ATP6 as well as nuclear-encoded subunits NDUFA11 and 
NDUFB8. These genes were co-expressed and not only highly correlated to PGC-1α but also highly associated 
with different muscle fiber types and enzyme activities of complex I and II. Therefore, we propose that mitochon￾drial haplotype contributes to muscle fiber type and energy metabolism in porcine via altering the gene expres￾sion of OXPHOS subunits mediated by the nuclear-mitochondrial crosstalk. In addition, different haplotypes 
showed variation in complex I activity. It directly supported the link between haplotype and energy metabolism.

The disrupted Ca2+ homeostasis affects mitochondrial membrane biogenesis and hence metabolic stress43. 
Under conditions of oxidative stress, the expression of ND6 is suppressed through methylation44. Consistent with 
our results, downregulated ND6 expression in PiPP pigs has been associated with mutant RYR1-induced mito￾chondrial injury and oxidative stress45. These evidences supported the possibility of haplotype 8 could be linked 
to oxidative stress with altered mitochondrial transcription in PiPP pigs.
Our results showed some of the mitochondrial and nuclear-encoded OXPHOS transcripts were significantly 
correlated to at least one of the phenotypes including muscle fiber type, metabolic enzyme activities and pH. The 
mtDNA encoded OXPHOS gene expression was highly associated with muscle fiber types, which is consistent 
with the fact that STO muscle fibers in general contain more mitochondria46. It is worth mentioning that the 
mRNA levels of ATP6, ND6, and ND2, which were the top three genes correlated with PGC-1α, also significantly 
correlated with muscle fiber type. Hence, it raised the possibility that mitochondrial-encoded subunits with high 
correlation with PGC-1a showed effects on muscle fiber types. The muscle oxidative capacity not only relies on 
mitochondrial function but also on mitochondrial density46. Our measured mtDNA copy number was correlated 
positively with STO fibers and oxidative enzyme activity while negatively correlated with FTG fibers. The mtDNA 
copy number is related to mitochondrial oxidative capacity and adipocyte lipogenesis47.
Conclusions
In summary, we investigated the mitochondrial DNA content and the expression of both mitochondrial and 
nuclear encoded OXPHOS genes in conjunction with post-mortem muscle phenotype, and metabolic enzyme 
activities in distinct haplotypes of pig breeds including Duroc, DuPi, PiNN, and PiPP. The most significant link 
between haplotypes or breeds to the muscle phenotype was found between the muscle fibers type and complex 
I. Specific expression pattern of mt transcript including ND1, ND6, and ATP6 and nuclear-encoded subunits 
NDUFA11 and NDUFB8 was identified and in turn play a role in muscle fibers type and enzyme activities of 
complex I. All of these changes in the PiPP haplotype 8 pigs may partially contribute to negative outcomes of meat 
quality such as pale soft exudative pork. PiPP pigs showed the lowest mtDNA copy number and reduced gene 
expression of many mitochondrial and nuclear encoded OXPHOS subunits compared to the other breeds. Our 
results provide valuable information on haplotype and breed-specific mitochondrial content variation as well as 
the molecular basis of mitochondrial respiration. Haplotypes could be linked to porcine energy metabolism at 
a functional level by altering gene expression of mitochondrial and nuclear OXPHOS subunits. Since haplotype 
7 Pietrain pigs demonstrate a high ratio of FTO muscle fibers, while haplotype 8 pigs show the lowest complex I 
activity among all other haplotypes, implementing a selection of the favorable haplotype 7 along with the RYR1 
locus in marker assisted selection program may further improve meat quality. Selection of the favorable haplotype 
can be used in marker assisted selection in pig breeding strategy.
Material and Methods
Sample collection and phenotypic measurement. The experiment and muscle collection were 
approved and authorized by the German and European animal welfare regulations for animal husbandry, trans￾port, and slaughter12–14. All experimental procedures, including animal care and tissue sample collection, fol￾lowed guidelines for safeguarding and good scientific practice in accordance with the German Law of Animal 
Protection, officially authorized by the Animal Care Committee and authorities [Niedersächsischen Landesamt 
für Verbraucherschutz und Lebensmittelsicherheit (LAVES) 33.42502/01-47.05].
Duroc, PiNN, PiPP, and DuPi pigs were raised to the age of 180 days at the University of Bonn. Muscle samples 
from each breed (Duroc, n=15; DuPi, n=16; PiNN, n=12; PiPP, n=15) were collected immediately (0 min 
postmortem) and 30min after stunning (30min postmortem) from LM between the 13th and 14th thoracic ver￾tebrae. Samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C until analysis.
We used the samples and all phenotypical traits from previously study which were measured as described12–14. 
In brief, the cryopreserved muscle samples were cutting into slices of 12µm thickness. NADH tetrazolium reduc￾tase and Myofibrillar ATPase were stained to identify the muscle fiber types. 3 sections were used for calculating 
the percentage of the slow-twitch-oxidative (STO), fast-twitch-oxidative (FTO) and fast-twitch glycolytic (FTG) 
fibers by relating the number of counted fibers of each type to the total counted fiber number. For measure￾ment of Metabolic Enzyme Activities, muscle samples were homogenized and all the experiments were finished 
within 2h in duplicate. GP catalyzed the degradation of glycogen (2mg/ml) to glucose-1-phosphate followed by 
the isomerization to glucose-6-phosphate (G-6-P) 2. GP activity was determined spectrophotometrically by the 
reduction of NADP+(1.6mM) to NADPH at 340nm and pH 6.8 when G-6-P dehydrogenase (5 U/ml) catalyzed 
G-6-P to gluconate-6-phosphate. PFK catalyzes fructose-6-phosphate (3.0mM) to fructose 1,6-bis-phosphate, 
which is split to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and dihydroxyacetonephosphate (DHAP). PFK activity was deter￾mined by the oxidation of NADH (1.6 mM) to NAD+at 340nm and pH 8.0 when glycerol-3-phosphate dehy￾drogenase (10 U/ml) /triosephosphate isomerase (100 U/ml) catalyzed DHAP to glycerol-3-phosphate. LDH 
activity was determined by the oxidation of NADH (150 µM) to NAD+at 340nm when LDH catalyzed pyruvate 
(1.2mM) to lactate. CS catalyzes acetyl-CoA (0.1 mM) and oxaloacetate (0.5 mM) to citrate to liberate CoA. CS 
activity was determined by the irreversible reaction of CoA with 5,5′-Dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid; 0.1mM) to 
thionitrobenzoic acid at 412nm 3. Complex I was spectrophotometrically determined by following the oxidation 
of NADH (0.2 mM) to NAD+at 340 nm. Complex II was determined at 600 nm following the reduction of 2, 
6-dichlorophenolindophenol (DCPIP) by ubiquinol resulting from this reaction. Complex IV was determined by 
following the oxidation of reduced cytochrome c to the oxidized form at 550nm and pH7.0.
DNA and RNA extraction. Genomic DNA from LM samples was extracted. Total RNA was isolated from 
muscle samples using Tri-reagent and RNeasy Minikit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) with an on-column DNase

treatment according to the manufacturer’s protocol. RNA integrity was assessed by 1% agarose gel electrophore￾sis. DNA and RNA concentration was measured on a NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer.
Mitochondria-specific primer design. Primers for the detection of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy 
number were carefully designed avoiding co-amplification of mitochondrial duplicated regions in the nuclear 
genome. Duplication of the mitochondrial genome in the nuclear genome was detected using BLASTN (http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov)48. The mitochondrial sequence (Sus scrofa 10.2 download from NCBI: http://www.
ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ on 1.9.2015) was split into fragments of 150 bps in length with a 50 bps overlap and blasted 
against the reference genome to identify a ‘unique’ mitochondrial sequence based on a significant threshold of 
E-value<0.1 and length>100bps. The result of duplicated regions was demonstrated using R package IdeoViz49
and a cytogenetic map of pig chromosomes was extracted from ArkDB (http://www.thearkdb.org/arkdb)50.
Absolute quantification of mtDNA copy number. The absolute quantification approach was used to 
determine mtDNA copy number. The mitochondrial genes ND1, ND2, and COX1 were used to quantify mtDNA 
copy number, whereas the nuclear gene glucagon gene (GCG), which is highly conserved between species and 
presents as a single copy, was used as the single-copy reference gene25,51. Primer sequences were presented in 
Supplementary Table 4 online. Mitochondrial and nuclear DNA standards were prepared separately using PCR 
products in seven serial dilutions at a dilution factor of 10. The amplified DNA fragments were purified with 
the QIAquick PCR Purification kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The purified products were quantified using a 
NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer (Peqlab, Erlangen, Germany). The copy number was calculated accord￾ing to the following equation52:
µ = µ copies l l / ng/
m (1)
=×. × − m n [1 096 10 ] (2) 12
where m is the mass of a single copy and n is the target size in base pairs.
The absolute copy numbers of ND1, ND2, COX1 and GCG were calculated based on their standard curves 
using the following equation:
= − copies 10 (3) ( ) Ct b a/
where a is the slope and b is the intercept of the regression line.
Since GCG is a single copy nuclear gene, the mtDNA copies per nuclear genome were calculated as follows:
mtDNA copies nuclear genome = mtDNA copies
nuclearDNA copies /
(4)
The mtDNA copy number per nuclear genome was calculated separately using ND1, ND2, and COX1. The data 
was reported as a mean.
Measurement of gene expression. High-throughput gene-expression analysis with EvaGreen dye on a 
BioMark HD real-time PCR system was used to measure gene expression according to manufacturer’s recom￾mendations (Fluidigm, San Francisco, CA, USA). All reagents were purchased from Fluidigm unless otherwise 
indicated. Briefly, cDNA was synthesized from 2 µg of total RNA using Superscript II reverse transcriptase and 
oligo-dT (Invitrogen) with specific target amplification and exonuclease I (New England Biolabs) treatment. 
qPCR reactions were performed using a 96×96 dynamic array and integrated fluidic circuit. Each sample inlet 
was loaded with 2.5 µL of 2×SsoFast EvaGreen supermix with low ROX (Biorad), 0.25 µL of 20×DNA-binding 
dye sample loading reagent, and 2.25µL of specific target amplification and exonuclease-I-treated sample. Assays 
were performed for mitochondrial-coded complex I subunits ND1, ND2, ND3, and ND4, complex III subunit 
CYB, complex IV subunit COX1, ATP synthase subunit ATP6, and nuclear-encoded complex I subunits NDUFA3, 
NDUFA11, NDUFA13, NDUFB8, NDUFS8, and NDUFV1, complex IV subunit COX7A2, ATP synthase subu￾nits ATP5G1 and ATP5L, and master regulator PGC-1α. All measurements were performed in duplicate. Primer 
sequence information is available in Supplementary Table 4. Reference genes ACTB, RPL32, and RPS11 were used 
to normalize expression values.
Sequence analysis. DNA from muscle samples of 53 animals (Duroc: N=15, DuPi: N=15, PiNN: N=9, 
PiPP: N=14) were sequenced using an ABI 3500 sequencer (Applied Biosystems Inc, Foster City, CA, USA). 
The D loop region was amplified using forward primer 5′-CTCCGCCATCAGCACCCAAAG-3′ and reverse 
primer 5′-GCACCTTGTTTGGATTRTCG-3′ 53. All sequences were aligned using Clustal×2.154. DNASP 5.1 
software was used to analyze the haplotypes of all sequences55. The detailed information of haplotypes is shown in 
Supplementary Table 2. Only the haplotypes with at least three animals were included in the subsequent statistical 
analysis.
Statistical analysis. Data were analyzed using SAS 9.4 statistical software (SAS Institute) and the MIXED 
procedure. The statistical model included the effects of breed (Duroc, PiNN, PiPP, and DuPi), sex (male and 
female), time (0 and 30min postmortem). With the same model, we also calculated with haplotype (Haplotypes 
1, 4, 6, 7, and 8) instead of breeds. The model was combined with a repeated statement for the time component to 
take into account correlations among measurements made on the same animal at time 0 and 30min postmortem.

Post hoc Tukey–Kramer method was used for multiple comparison adjustments. Results were reported as 
least-squares means (Lsmeans) with standard error (SE) and considered to be statistically significant if p<0.05. 
Data were plotted using GraphPad Prism 5. The correlation coefficient (r) between gene expression and pheno￾typic measurement was calculated for all individuals. The correlation plots were generated in R.
