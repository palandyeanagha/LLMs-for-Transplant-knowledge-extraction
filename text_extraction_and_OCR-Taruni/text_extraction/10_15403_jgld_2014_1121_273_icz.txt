INTRODUCTION
Primary biliary cholangitis 
(PBC) is a chronic cholestatic 
l ive r c ond it i on af fe c t i ng 
predominantly middle-aged 
women. It may exert a significant 
negative effect on the patient`s

of patients [1]. Ursodeoxycholic 
ORIGINAL PAPER
ABSTRACT
Background & Aims: Chronic liver disease induces an acquired deficiency of S-adenosyl-L-methionine 
(SAMe) leading to impairment of detoxifying processes in the liver. Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) represents 
the standard treatment in primary biliary cholangitis (PBC). As both compounds exert their hepatoprotective 
effects by different mechanisms, it is conceivable that when used together their effect might be additive. The 
aim of this study was to analyse the effect of SAMe supplementation on liver biochemistry and health-related 
quality of life (HRQoL) in patients with PBC, treated with UDCA.
Methods. In this prospective pilot, proof of the principle, non-randomized and open label study we enrolled 
24 patients with PBC treated with UDCA for at least 6 months. They had received both UDCA in a standard 
dose of 13-15 mg/kg b.w. and SAMe in the dose of 1200 mg daily over a period of 6 months. A group of 
24 patients with PBC treated with UDCA served as control for liver biochemistry (Study registered on the 
platform ClinicalTrials.gov under ID: NCT02557360).
Results. We observed a significant decrease of ALP, GGT and total cholesterol in non-cirrhotic patients treated 
with SAMe. There was also a significant improvement of fatigue and pruritus in PBC-40 questionnaire and 
amelioration of anxiety in STAI 2 questionnaire in the SAMe group. Treatment with SAMe neither increased 
sulfation capacity of the liver nor had an effect on fibroblast growth factor-19 serum levels. 
Conclusions. Our pilot study demonstrates a positive effect of adding SAMe to UDCA in non-cirrhotic 
patients with PBC.

acid (UDCA) remains a standard therapy for PBC. However, 
a significant proportion of patients do not respond to this 
treatment [2]. S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAMe) is involved 
in numerous biochemical reactions, playing a role of a major 
methyl and sulfate group donor and a precursor of cysteine 
and glutathione [3]. Chronic liver disease induces an acquired 
deficiency of methionine adenosyltransferase, which catalyzes 
SAMe formation from methionine leading to a depletion of 
the amount of SAMe and potential impairment of detoxifying 
processes in the liver [3]. SAMe as a single agent has been 
used in the past for the treatment of chronic liver diseases 
with equivocal results [4, 5]. Our previous experimental 
works demonstrated that simultaneous treatment with UDCA

and SAMe may exert beneficial, additive effect ameliorating 
cholestasis [6]. We postulated that hepatoprotective effects of 
SAMe may result from its role as a precursor of sulfate groups 
for detoxification processes in the liver [7, 8]. 
In this prospective, pilot, proof of the principle and open 
label study we analyzed the effect of the simultaneous treatment 
of UDCA and SAMe on liver biochemistry and HRQoL in 
patients with PBC.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
We prospectively enrolled 24 consecutive patients with 
PBC, all female, treated with UDCA in a standard dose over a 
period of at least 6 months. All patients were recruited at two 
Polish Universities (Medical University of Warsaw, Warsaw 
and Pomeranian Medical University, Szczecin) between 
October 2015 and October 2016. The diagnosis of PBC was 
established according to the European Association for the 
Study of Liver criteria [2]. The severity of liver fibrosis was 
estimated by Shear Wave Elastography (SuperSonic Imagine; 
Aixplorer, Aix-en-Provence, France) performed by a single, 
experienced professional. A cut-off value for the diagnosis of 
liver cirrhosis was set at 13.0 kPa according to a recent meta￾analysis [9]. Patients with concomitant liver diseases, taking 
immunosuppressive, antipruritic, antihyperlipidemic and 
antidepressive drugs three months prior to baseline recording 
were considered not suitable for the study. Beside UDCA in 
the dose of 13-15 mg/kg b.w., all patients received vitamin D 
and calcium supplementation.
Participants received SAMe 1200 mg/daily in two divided 
doses (800 mg in the morning and 400 mg midday) over the 
period of 6 months. In both study centres they were monitored 
by experienced hepatologists in out-patient clinics at baseline, 
interim visits at weeks: 2, 4, 12, end of treatment at 24 weeks and 
follow-up visit after 4-6 weeks wash-out period. Treatment and 
intervention adherence, adverse events, serum biochemistry 
and HRQoL were assessed at each visit. 
Laboratory assessments encompassed routine serum 
biochemistry including alanine (ALT) and aspartate 
aminotransferases (AST), gammaglutamyl-transpeptidase 
(GGT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), total bilirubin, albumin, 
international normalized ratio (INR) and total cholesterol. 
In order to investigate the effect of SAMe on liver 
sulfation capacities, serum levels of lithocholic acid (LCA) 
and sulfated LCA (LCA-S) were measured using validated 
liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/
MS) method [10, 11]. For each patient, LCA/LCA-S ratio was 
subsequently calculated. 
As we previously showed, fibroblast growth factor-19 (FGF￾19), an important regulatory factor of bile acids synthesis, may 
serve as a valuable indicator of the cholestatic liver injury [12]. 
Therefore, in order to evaluate the potential hepatoprotective 
role of SAMe in cholestasis, we measured FGF-19 serum 
levels in the study group at the baseline and end-point as we 
described before [12]. 
HRQoL was assessed with a disease-specific questionnaire 
(PBC-40) [13, 14]. Chronic fatigue was measured by Modified 
Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS) [15]. Emotional distress was 
assessed with Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) 
[16] and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). 
Four patients dropped-out from the study (one patient 2 
weeks after inclusion, three others 4 weeks after inclusion) 
due to non-specific symptoms including abdominal pain or 
cramps. As the study protocol did not permit antipruritic 
therapies two other patients who complained of significant 
itching at baseline and who did not notice any improvement 
during the treatment were also removed from the study (at 4 
weeks) in order to implement antipruritic therapy. Thus, 18 
patients (10 with cirrhosis) aged 38-65 years (mean 54.2±8.2) 
were finally included.
Twenty four age-matched, consecutive female patients with 
PBC treated with UDCA for a period of at least 6 months served 
as controls for a comparison of liver biochemistry. 
Ethics
Written informed consent was obtained from each patient 
included in the study. The study was performed following the 
principles of good clinical practice and in accordance with 
the ethical guidelines of the 1975 Declaration of Helsinki (6th 
revision, 2008). The study protocol was approved by the Ethics 
Committee of Pomeranian Medical University and Medical 
University of Warsaw. The study was registered on the platform 
ClinicalTrials.gov under ID: NCT02557360. 
Statistical analysis 
Descriptive statistical methods were used to analyze all 
variables. Continuous variables were evaluated using the 
number of observations, arithmetic mean and standard 
deviation (SD). Categorical data are described using absolute 
frequencies. To evaluate the changes in serum liver function 
tests we calculated delta values from baseline to the end of 
treatment visit for each patient. The Shapiro-Wilk normality 
test was used to examine the distribution of quantitative 
variables. The Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test and 
the paired t-test were applied as appropriate to calculate the 
differences between variables at single time points. Pearson 
correlation coefficients and chi-square test were used to 
check the variables influencing SAMe biochemical response. 
To compare the differences between study and control 
groups unpaired t-test or Mann-Whitney test were applied. 
Calculations were performed using GraphPad Prism for 
Windows (Version 7.0). A p value less than 0.05 was considered 
statistically significant.
RESULTS
The baseline demographic and liver biochemistry data 
of study and control group are presented in Table I. At the 
enrolment there were no significant differences between the 
study and the control group.
Effect of SAMe on liver biochemistry 
When baseline and 6 months results were compared, a 
significant improvement in ALP, GGT and cholesterol levels 
was seen in non-cirrhotic patients treated with SAMe. These 
data are shown in Fig. 1. In patients with cirrhosis, a significant

reduction of bilirubin level was noted. When all patients 
treated with SAMe were considered there was a significant 
reduction of total bilirubin and GGT levels. In the control 
group there were no changes in liver function tests. Data on 
liver biochemistry in all analysed groups are summarized in 
Table II. Withdrawal of SAMe caused almost uniform increase 
of liver biochemistry taken one month later but it did not reach 
statistical significance (Supplementary Fig. 1).

We observed an enhancement of sulfated derivative of LCA 
in patients treated with SAMe; however, these changes did 
not reach statistical significance (LCA/LCA-S ratio 4.8±8.1 at 
baseline vs 2.8±3.4 at 24 weeks; p=0.55). In order to evaluate 
SAMe capacity to reduce cholestatic liver injury we measured 
serum FGF-19 levels. We did not observe any changes between 
baseline and end-point FGF-19 values in both non-cirrhotic 
(162.9±160.1 at baseline vs 162.2±152.9 pg/ml at 24 weeks; 
p=0.99) and cirrhotic patients treated with SAMe (176.0±181.9 
at baseline vs 149.6±124.7 pg/ml at 24 weeks; p=0.3).
Effect of SAMe on the HRQoL
In line with the enhancement of markers of liver injury the 
therapy with SAMe led to the improvement of the patients’ 
well-being. In particular, a significant improvement of fatigue 
and pruritus measured by PBC-40 questionnaire as well as 
emotional distress in STAI 2 was seen when scorings from 
baseline and end of treatment were compared. There was also a 
trend towards the improvement of MFIS scores and Depression 
and Anxiety domains of HADS without reaching statistical 
significance. These data are summarized in Table III. 
DISCUSSION
SAMe plays a crucial role in several biochemical processes 
exerting its protective effect in various cells. Several conditions 
that increase oxidative stress, hypoxia or nitric oxide synthesis, 
which include viral hepatitis, alcoholic liver disease or 
various toxins disturb synthesis of SAMe via a direct effect on 
methionine adenyltransferase, i.e. the enzyme responsible for 
SAMe synthesis from methionine [17]. We have recently shown 
that protection against oxidative stress mediated by Nrf2/Keap1 
pathway is also significantly impaired in PBC [18].
SAMe has been extensively studied in a large number 
of animal and experimental studies. Its supplementation 
leads to increased intracellular concentration of glutathione 
both in experimental models [19] and in patients with liver 
diseases [20]. It prevented liver hypoxia and restored activity of 
mitochondrial respiratory complexes in a rat model of alcohol 
induced fatty liver [21]. 
In terms of using SAMe in humans, literature data are 
scanty. A recent meta-analysis screened almost 2000 articles 
(both animal and human studies) selecting only 11 studies as 
being suitable for the analysis [22]. Strikingly, in all but two

papers, SAMe was administered for a period of equal or less 
than 4 weeks, and a predominant indication was obstetric 
cholestasis. Considering the mode of action of SAMe it may 
seem unrealistic to expect its detectable effect within such a 
short time. Only in one study depicted by the above meta￾analysis the treatment with SAMe was administered for a 
prolonged period of time. Mato et al. [4] in a multicentre, 
randomized, double blind study including a group of 123 
patients with alcoholic cirrhosis applied SAMe in the dose of 
1200mg/daily for the period of 24 months. They demonstrated 
that in patients with Child A and B cirrhosis, SAMe exerted 
a significant effect by reducing the death rates or the number 
of patients requiring liver transplantation. In a group treated 
with SAMe, only 12% of patients reached end points (i.e. 
overall mortality/liver transplantation) as compared to 29% 
in a placebo group (p=0.025). SAMe also significantly affected 
two-year survival (85% vs 67% in placebo group). Treatment

was well tolerated and no severe adverse effects were reported. 
The second longest trial mentioned in the meta-analysis was 
a randomized, double blind study undertaken by Medici et al. 
[5]. It comprised 37 subjects with alcoholic liver disease, 18 of 
them received SAMe and 19 placebo. The SAMe dose of 1200 
mg/daily was identical to the one used in the Mato et al. [4] 
study and it was administered over the period of 6 months. An 
improvement of liver biochemistry in both groups was seen, 
likely related to alcohol abstinence, and it was not significantly 
better in SAMe group than in the placebo one. This perhaps 
should not be a surprise when we compared these results with 
the study of Mato et al. [4] on patients with the same etiology, 
where no effect was seen after 6 months of SAMe treatment. 
Indeed, Medici et al. [5] study seems to confirm the notion 
that SAMe ideally should be used for a longer period of time, 
at least in patients with alcoholic etiology. This concept may 
somehow be supported by the results of the study by Feld et 
al. [23]. They clearly demonstrated that adding SAMe in the 
dose of 800mg bd to the treatment of hepatitis C with pegylated 
interferon and ribavirin over a period of 12 months increased 
interferon stimulated gene in non-responders to previous 
therapy. The in vitro work included in this study [23] showed 
that SAMe improved interferon signalling and its antiviral 
effect. This phenomenon was linked to enhanced metylation 
induced by SAMe. As there is only one published randomized 
study where SAMe was used as a single agent for a period 
longer than 6 months, one has to agree with the conclusion 
of the review paper which said that “to date no large, high 
quality, randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials have been 
performed that definitely establish clinical utility (of SAMe) in 
specific disease states” [24]. 
In this pilot, proof of the principle and open label work 
we studied the effect of SAMe on liver biochemistry and 
HRQoL in a small group of consecutive patients with PBC 
who were treated with UDCA for a period of at least 6 months. 
A rationale for this analysis was based on our laboratory 
studies performed almost two decades ago when we used a 
hepatocyte couplets model for the study of hepatoprotection 
in experimentally induced cholestasis [6, 7, 25, 26]. We 
demonstrated both protective and reversing effect of SAMe on 
lithocholate and 17β-estradiol glucuronide induced cholestasis. 
This effect was additive in the former when UDCA and SAMe 
were used simultaneously. As UDCA and SAMe exert their 
hepatoprotective effects by different molecular and biochemical 
mechanisms, it is conceivable that when used together, their 
effect may potentially be additive. We have shown that the 
hepatoprotective effect of SAMe, at least partially and in 
experimental models, may be related to its role as a sulphate 
donor, as the anticholestatic effect of SAMe was ameliorated by 
dehydroepiandrosterone, which competes for sulphate group 
with 17β-estradiol glucuronide. Sulphation of the latter makes 
it more water soluble and non-cholestatic. 
These present results did not, however, confirm our 
hypothesis on a potential role of SAMe as a sulphate donor. 
Although we observed an enhancement of sulphated derivative 
of LCA in both cirrhotic and non-cirrhotic patients treated 
with SAMe, these changes did not reach statistical significance. 
Treatment with SAMe had also no effect on serum levels of 
FGF-19, which as we demonstrated before, correlate with 
Mayo Risk Score and are significantly increased in UDCA 
non-responders [12]. These findings may be related to the 
small size of the analysed cohort and, in our opinion, require 
further studies on a larger group of patients. 
In the present study we observed a significant improvement 
in ALP, GGT and total cholesterol in non-cirrhotic patients. 
This may suggest that SAMe exerts its effect particularly in 
earlier stages of the disease and it may somehow correspond 
with the results of the Mato et al. [4] study where SAMe 
showed no effect in patients with advanced disease and the 
Child C score.
HRQoL has emerged as one of the most important issues 
in contemporary medicine. Improvement in liver biochemistry 
excites treating physicians, but from the patients’ perspective 
does not mean much if it is not associated with improved 
QoL. Some treatments may clearly improve the liver tests but 
simultaneously have no effect or even affect negatively patients’ 
wellbeing, a good example being steroids in autoimmune 
hepatitis. Chronic fatigue and pruritus are considered to be 
the most debilitating symptoms in PBC. Treatment with SAMe 
caused a significant improvement of both symptoms. Certainly, 
these results have to be interpreted with caution. First of all, 
patients included into the study did not have a significant itching 
and did not use antipruritic agents over the period of study. 
Two patients with more pronounced itching were withdrawn 
within one month as they did not observe any improvement 
of their pruritus and were put on antipruritic treatment. Thus, 
a statistically significant improvement of pruritus is a surprise, 
but on the other hand a positive effect of SAMe on itching was 
reported in a randomized study in obstetric cholestasis [27]. We 
have also seen a significant improvement caused by SAMe on 
the fatigue domain of PBC-40 questionnaire. SAMe has a well 
described antidepressive properties, which are comparable to 
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) [28]. Although 
SSRIs did not prove effective in the treatment of fatigue in PBC 
in a small randomized study [29], antidepressants are frequently 
prescribed in fatigued patients with PBC [30]. A recent review 
strongly suggested that SAMe might prove useful in various 
psychiatric conditions including not only depression but also 
mood disturbance or anxiety [31]. In our patients treated with 
SAMe we observed a significant improvement in the STAI 2 
questionnaire, which is a well validated tool for the assessment 
of anxiety. We have also seen a trend towards improvement in 
the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale and Depression and Anxiety 
domain of HADS but certainly it is too early to draw any firm 
conclusions from these findings. Four patients were removed 
from the study because of unspecific symptoms, mostly 
abdominal cramps. As SAMe in the dose we used or 800 mg 
bd was well tolerated in other studies, this finding was indeed 
unexpected. The severity of symptoms was mild/moderate and 
perhaps not related to the treatment (one third of the patients 
with PBC report unspecific right upper abdominal quadrant 
pain); however, we decided to remove these patients from the 
study after 4 weeks. 
CONCLUSIONS
In this pilot study on a small cohort of patients with PBC

caused by SAMe in non-cirrhotics and a clear positive effect 
on HRQoL. In our opinion, these early results warrant further 
study on a larger cohort of patients to characterize a potential 
positive effect of SAMe in patients with chronic cholestatic 
liver conditions.

Supplementary Fig. 1. Absolute changes in serum ALP (A), GGT (B), total bilirubin (C) and 
AST (D) levels throughout the study period in all patients treated with SAMe. During the 
treatment period a significant improvement of GGT, total bilirubin and AST levels was noted. 
Withdrawal of SAMe caused a uniform increase of liver biochemistry but it did not reach statistical 
significance. Y axis indicates absolute changes compared to baseline levels. Continuous variables 
are summarized using the arithmetic mean and the standard error of the mean (SEM). Two-sided p
values were calculated using paired t-tests or Wilcoxon rank sum tests in comparison to baseline. * 
indicates p<0.05, ** indicates p<0.01***, indicates p<0.001 and **** indicates p<0.0001.
