for prion researchers to refer to the 
normal nonpathogenic conformation 
of prions as “cellular prion proteins” 
(3). When these normal cellular prion 
precursors convert to pathogenic 
prion proteins, the transmissible 
conformations are characterized by 
β-pleated sheets rather than the normal 
α-helix structure, and they do not elicit 
an immune response (4).

Hepatitis E Virus 
Infection in 
Sheltered Homeless 
Persons, France
 To the Editor: Kaba et al. (1) 
reported a seroprevalence of 11.6% 
for hepatitis E virus (HEV) among 
homeless persons in the city of 
Marseille, located in southern France, 
and a multivariate analysis suggested 
that injection drug use (IDU) was 
an independent risk factor for HEV 
transmission. We disagree with this 
reported fi nding. 
We conducted a retrospective 
subanalysis of results from a multicenter 
therapeutic trial assessing HEV 
seroprevalence among HIV/hepatitis 
C co-infected patients in France (2). 
Serum samples from 84 IDU patients, 
enrolled during 2000–2002 were stored 
at −80°C. The mean ± SD age of the 
patients was 39 ± 4 years; 53 (63%) 
were men, 19 (23%) were born outside 
France, and 38 (45%) were living 
in southern France. HEV antibodies 
were tested with the same assay as 
that used by Kaba et al. (1), and HEV 
RNA was detected by using a real-time 
reverse transcription PCR amplifying 
open reading frame 3 (3). None of the 
patients had detectable IgM against 
HEV or HEV RNA. Test results for 3 
(3.6%) patients were positive for HEV 
IgG. Two of them lived in southern 
France, resulting in a 5.3% (2/38) HEV 
prevalence for IDU patients living in 
this region, where HEV IgG prevalence 
for healthy blood donors has reportedly 
ranged from 9% to 16.6% (4).
The difference between our study, 
which demonstrated low HEV IgG 
prevalence in IDU patients, even in 
southern France, and the results from 
Kaba et al. (1) must be interpreted with 
caution because there were several 
epidemiologic differences between 
the 2 populations. Moreover, there 
is a risk for false-negative serologic 
results for HIV patients because of 
impaired immunity, and the predictive 
value of serologic testing is probably 
low because of the artifi cially low 
HEV prevalence reported for this 
population. Despite these limitations, 
our study suggests that the high 
prevalence of HEV infection among 
homeless persons in southern France 
was not infl uenced by IDU, but 
refl ected the general epidemiology of 
HEV in this region.

In Response: The letter of Larrat 
et al. (1) raises interesting questions, 
but we disagree with the authors’ 
conclusion. Their study and ours 
investigated the seroprevalence of 
infection with hepatitis E virus (HEV) 
(1,2); however, the 2 studies examined 
different populations. We studied 
homeless persons, for whom analysis 
of risk factors associated with HEV 
infection emphasized injection drug 
use (2). This represented independent 
data: injection drug use was a 
behavior associated with increased 
anti-HEV prevalence; a causal 
relationship between injection drug 
use and hepatitis E was not inferred. 
In contrast to our study population, 
the population studied by Larrat et 
al. comprised patients who were co￾infected with HIV and hepatitis C virus 
and who reported injection drug use as 
the route of HIV or hepatitis C virus 
transmission: a distinctly different 
population from homeless persons 
(1). It is likely that behavior of HIV￾positive and HIV-negative intravenous 
drug users is not the same. Moreover, 
late seroconversion, persistent 
seronegativity, and seroreversion of 
IgG against HEV have been reported 
for severely immunocompromized 
patients, including some infected 
with HIV (3–5), which brings up the 
question as to whether prevalence of 
IgG against HEV is underestimated 
among severely immunocompromised 
persons infected with HIV. 
Seroprevalence studies of 
different populations, especially those 
with differing immune responses, 
cannot lead except by chance to the 
same result. Of note, we recently 
reported that HEV seroprevalence 
was 2.3% among injection drug users 
infected with HIV (5).
