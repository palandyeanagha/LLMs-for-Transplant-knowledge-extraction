ABSTRACT
Inflammatory pseudotumour is a generic term applied to a
variety of neoplastic and non-neoplastic entities that share
a common histological appearance, namely a cytologically
bland spindle cell proliferation with a prominent, usually
chronic inflammatory infiltrate. Over the last two decades,
inflammatory myofibroblastic tumour (IMT) has emerged
from within the broad category of inflammatory pseudo￾tumour, with distinctive clinical, pathological and mole￾cular features. IMT shows a predilection for the visceral
soft tissues of children and adolescents and has a
tendency for local recurrence, but only a small risk of
distant metastasis. Characteristic histological patterns
include the fasciitis-like, compact spindle cell and
hypocellular fibrous patterns, which are often seen in
combination within the same tumour. Chromosomal
translocations leading to activation of the ALK tyrosine
kinase can be detected in approximately 50% of IMTs,
particularly those arising in young patients. This review
will examine the clinical, pathological, and molecular
genetic features of IMT and discuss an approach to
diagnosis and differential diagnosis.
The term ‘‘inflammatory pseudotumour’’ has been
used to describe a wide range of reactive and
neoplastic lesions, including inflammatory myofi￾broblastic tumour (IMT), pseudosarcomatous
myofibroblastic proliferations of the genitourinary
(GU) tract, infectious and reparative processes, and
inflammatory pseudotumours of lymph node,
spleen and orbit. Over the last two decades, IMT
has emerged as a distinct entity with characteristic
clinical, pathological and molecular features.
However, confusion remains regarding the distinc￾tion of these tumours from other lesions in the
‘‘inflammatory pseudotumour’’ family, as well as
from non-neoplastic fibrosclerosing processes and
malignant neoplasms with a prominent inflamma￾tory infiltrate. This review will examine the
clinicopathological and molecular features of IMT
and discuss its differential diagnosis, with empha￾sis on other entities included under the umbrella of
inflammatory pseudotumour.
HISTORY
Inflammatory pseudotumour was first described in
the lung, where it was considered a reparative
postinflammatory condition rather than a neoplas￾tic process.1 2 Histologically similar lesions were
subsequently reported at extrapulmonary sites,
and distinctive clinical features, including a pre￾dilection for children and young adults and
associated systemic symptoms in a minority of
patients, were recognised.3–8 These tumours were
widely considered benign and likely non-neoplastic
until the early 1990s when Meis and Enzinger
published a series of 38 cases, primarily intra￾abdominal and retroperitoneal tumours in children
and adolescents, which they termed ‘‘inflamma￾tory fibrosarcoma’’ based on follow-up data show￾ing a significant rate of aggressive behaviour.9
Among the 27 patients with clinical follow-up in
this series, 10 (37%) had local recurrences, 3 (11%)
developed metastases, and 5 (19%) died from
disease.9 In 1995, Coffin et al reported 84 cases of
extrapulmonary IMT, which overlapped clinically
and histologically with ‘‘inflammatory fibrosar￾coma,’’ although the recurrence rate was some￾what lower (25%) and no metastases occurred.10
The identification of recurrent clonal rearrange￾ments involving chromosome 2p over the next
several years provided additional support that IMT
was a distinct neoplasm; ‘‘inflammatory fibrosar￾coma’’ is now considered indistinguishable from,
and within the morphological spectrum of, IMT.
CLINICAL FEATURES
IMTs have a predilection for children and adoles￾cents, although they may arise as late as the eighth
decade of life.9 11 12 The most common anatomical
locations are the abdominopelvic region, lung, and
retroperitoneum,10 but virtually any site may be
involved, including the somatic soft tissues, bone,
larynx, uterus and central nervous system.13–17
Accurate data regarding the incidence and anato￾mical distribution of IMT are difficult to obtain
due to the use of the terms ‘‘inflammatory
pseudotumour’’ and ‘‘IMT’’ interchangeably in
the literature; however, one recent review of 275
‘‘inflammatory pseudotumours’’ in children
reported that approximately one-third of cases
were pulmonary and two-thirds were extrapul￾monary.18
Patients generally present with a mass or non￾specific symptoms, including vague abdominal
pain or gastrointestinal complaints for intra￾abdominal lesions, and cough, chest pain, or, less
often, haemoptysis for pulmonary tumours.10 19 20
A constitutional syndrome consisting of fever,
weight loss and malaise is seen in 15–30% of
patients, and laboratory evaluation may reveal
microcytic anaemia, a raised erythrocyte sedimen￾tation rate, thrombocytosis, and/or polyclonal
hypergammaglobulinaemia.9 10 In some cases, the
mass may be found only after an extensive workup
for fever of unknown origin or growth failure.5 8 21
The systemic manifestations resolve following
surgical excision, and tumour recurrence may be
heralded by a return of clinical and laboratory
abnormalities.10 19 21 A similar clinical presentation
may be seen in the plasma cell variant of

Castleman disease, in which overproduction of interleukin 6
(IL-6) is thought to be the underlying cause of the systemic
complaints.22 Two patients with IMT were reported to have
raised serum levels of IL-6 that returned to normal post￾operatively as their systemic symptoms resolved,23 24 and several
authors have demonstrated production of IL-6 mRNA and
protein by tumour cells, supporting a possible analogous
mechanism in IMT.23–25
PATHOLOGICAL FEATURES
Grossly, IMTs may be firm, fleshy, or gelatinous, with a white
or tan cut surface. Calcification, haemorrhage and necrosis are
identified in a minority of cases.9 10 Tumours range from 1 cm to
.20 cm in greatest dimension, with a mean size of 6 cm.9 10 A
subset of IMTs, particularly those in the abdomen or retro￾peritoneum, present as multiple discrete masses in the same
anatomical region.7 9 10
Histologically, IMTs are characterised by a variably cellular
spindle cell proliferation in a myxoid to collagenous stroma
with a prominent inflammatory infiltrate composed primarily
of plasma cells and lymphocytes, with occasional admixed
eosinophils and neutrophils. Coffin et al described three basic
histological patterns, which are often seen in combination
within the same tumour: a myxoid/vascular pattern, a compact
spindle cell pattern, and a hypocellular fibrous (fibromatosis￾like) pattern.10 The myxoid/vascular pattern has a fasciitis-like
appearance, with loosely arranged plump spindle cells in an
oedematous or myxoid stroma and a prominent vasculature
(fig 1). The inflammatory infiltrate in these areas often contains
more neutrophils and eosinophils and fewer plasma cells than in
the other two patterns. The compact spindle cell pattern is
characterised by a cellular proliferation of spindle cells with a
fascicular or storiform architecture in a collagenous stroma
(fig 2). These foci typically show numerous plasma cells and
lymphocytes intimately admixed with the spindle cells, but
discrete lymphoid follicles and aggregates of plasma cells are also
common. The fibromatosis-like pattern is relatively hypocellu￾lar, with elongated rather than plump spindle cells in a densely
collagenous background containing scattered lymphocytes,
plasma cells and eosinophils (fig 3). Focal dystrophic calcifica￾tion and even metaplastic ossification can be seen in hyalinised
areas.10 26 Foamy histiocytes are prominent in a minority of
IMTs.15 19
The spindle cells of IMT are typically uniform and
predominantly myofibroblastic in appearance, with palely
eosinophilic cytoplasm, plump ovoid to tapering vesicular nuclei
and one or two small nucleoli (fig 4). Mild nuclear pleomorph￾ism may be seen, but hyperchromasia is absent. Approximately
one half of cases contain scattered ‘‘ganglion-like’’ cells (fig 5):
larger polygonal cells with abundant amphophilic to eosino￾philic cytoplasm, large vesicular nuclei and prominent nucleoli,
similar to those seen in proliferative fasciitis.9 27 Mitotic activity
is generally low (0–2 mitoses per 10 HPF), and atypical mitoses
are rare.10 15 27 28 Necrosis and vascular invasion have been
reported in typical IMTs but are very infrequent.10 29 30 Rarely,
IMTs may undergo histological evolution to a morphologically
higher grade lesion (fig 6) with increased cellularity, marked
nuclear atypia, frequent mitoses, atypical mitotic figures, and/
or necrosis.10 20 28 31 The cytological features of the morphologi￾cally higher grade tumours are variable, including hypercellular
spindle cell, epithelioid/histiocytoid, or round cell morphol￾ogy.10 28 31
By ultrastructural analysis, IMTs are composed predomi￾nantly of myofibroblasts with a smaller fibroblastic compo￾nent10 19 32; the ganglion-like cells show features of fibroblasts.33
As expected given their myofibroblastic differentiation, IMTs
are positive for smooth muscle actin in 80–90% of cases and
express desmin and calponin in 60–70%, although reactivity for
these markers is often focal.10 15 30 33 Approximately one-third of
tumours show focal keratin reactivity,10 34 which is not
unexpected given that myofibroblasts, similar to smooth muscle
cells, may be keratin positive.35 36 The plasma cell infiltrate is
polyclonal.15 19
Due to the prominent inflammatory infiltrate and associated
systemic symptoms in a minority of patients with IMT, a viral
aetiology has been proposed, but the evidence in this regard is
unconvincing. A small subset of so-called inflammatory
pseudotumours of lymph node, liver and spleen contain
detectable Epstein–Barr virus (EBV)37–39; however, it is likely
that most if not all of these cases do not represent true IMTs
(see below). The presence of EBV in classic IMTs of other
anatomical sites is rare.10 33 40–42 One group identified human
herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8) DNA in both pulmonary and extra￾pulmonary IMT, but expression of HHV-8-associated antigens
was not investigated,25 43 and other authors have not found
evidence for HHV-8 infection in IMT.40 41
MOLECULAR FEATURES
Rearrangements involving the ALK (anaplastic lymphoma
kinase) locus on chromosome 2p23 have been documented in
both pulmonary and extrapulmonary IMTs, providing further
support for the neoplastic nature of these lesions and their
distinction from other ‘‘inflammatory pseudotumours’’.44 45 The
ALK gene encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase that is only
expressed in neural tissue under normal conditions.46 Clonal
abnormalities of ALK were first described in anaplastic large cell
lymphoma (ALCL), in which 50–60% of cases contain a
translocation of the ALK gene leading to constitutive tyrosine
kinase activation.47 Approximately 50% of IMTs also show ALK
rearrangements by FISH,44 and several ALK fusion partners have
been identified, including TPM3 at 1p23, TPM4 at 19p13, ATIC
at 2q35, CLTC at 17q23, CARS at 11p15, RANBP2 at 2q13 and
SEC31L1 at 4q21.48–54 The most common fusion protein in ALCL
(NPM-ALK) has not been identified in IMT, but the TPM3-
ALK, ATIC-ALK and CLTC-ALK fusion proteins have been

reported in both neoplasms, and thus represent rare examples of
translocation-derived chimeric tyrosine kinases driving both
mesenchymal and lymphoid neoplasms.55–59
By immunohistochemistry, approximately 50% of IMTs are
positive for ALK, with reactivity in several large series ranging
from 36% to 71% (fig 7). Similar to ALCL, ALK expression in
IMT is more common in younger patients, but is not restricted
to this population.11 44 50 60 ALK expression in IMT reliably
predicts the presence of an ALK gene rearrangement (which can
be detected by FISH or RT-PCR),11 42 44 and the pattern of ALK
immunostaining may correlate with the specific gene fusion,11
although this has yet to be validated in large series of ALK￾positive cases. Localisation of ALK within the cell appears to be
determined by its fusion partner, leading to diffuse cytoplasmic
staining for ALK with the TPM3, TPM4, CARS, ATIC and
SEC31L1 fusion partners, all of which are cytoplasmic pro￾teins11 51 52 54; nuclear membrane staining with the RANBP2
fusion partner, a nuclear pore protein11 53; and granular
cytoplasmic staining with the CLTC fusion partner, a main
structural protein of coated vesicles.11 49 Although current data
are too limited to draw conclusions regarding a possible
relationship between gene fusion type and prognosis, both
reported cases with the RANBP2-ALK fusion showed round cell

transformation, raising the possibility that this subset may be
clinically more aggressive.11 53
Most other myofibroblastic and fibroblastic tumours, includ￾ing desmoid fibromatosis, nodular fasciitis, calcifying fibrous
tumour, myofibromatosis, and infantile fibrosarcoma, are
negative for ALK.11 61 62 ALK expression has been reported in a
subset of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumours, rhabdo￾myosarcomas, Ewing sarcomas, leiomyosarcomas, extraskeletal
myxoid chondrosarcomas, and benign and malignant adipocytic
neoplasms,11 61 63 but with the exception of leiomyosarcoma,
these tumours generally do not enter the histological differential
diagnosis of IMT. The molecular mechanisms responsible for
ALK expression in non-IMT mesenchymal tumours are uncer￾tain; most cases lack ALK rearrangements by RT-PCR or FISH
and express the full-length ALK transcript rather than the
truncated or chimeric form seen in IMTs.61
PROGNOSIS
IMTs are classified as tumours of intermediate biological
potential by the most recent World Health Organization
classification, due to a tendency for local recurrence and a
small risk of distant metastasis.34 The recurrence rate varies by
anatomical site, from ,2% for tumours confined to the lung18 64
to 25% for extrapulmonary lesions.10 Recurrences are particu￾larly common among multinodular intra-abdominal tumours
and those in delicate anatomical locations such as the larynx or
trachea, likely reflecting the difficulty of complete surgical
resection. In contrast, several recent studies have reported that
recurrence is very infrequent following complete excision of a
solitary lesion.64–67
Distant metastasis of IMT is rare, occurring in ,5% of cases.34
Of the 21 metastasising IMTs in the literature, the primary
tumours affected patients over a broad age range (17 months to
79 years) and arose in a variety of anatomical sites, including 7
in the lung, 6 in the abdomen/mesentery, 3 in the retro￾peritoneum, and 1 each in the mediastinum, liver, iliac bone,
neck, and forearm.9 12 28 31 32 51 68–75 The most common sites of
metastasis are lung and brain, followed by liver and bone.
Metastatic disease is usually identified at presentation or within
a year of diagnosis, but occasional patients develop metastases
as many as 9 years following excision.74
Several studies have attempted to identify histological
predictors of aggressive behaviour in IMT without much
success. Tumour size, cellularity, mitotic activity and the
presence of necrosis do not appear to correlate with out￾come.27 28 30 One study suggested that the presence of nuclear
atypia and ganglion-like cells might indicate more aggressive
behaviour, but these features were also seen in over half of the
clinically benign IMTs, limiting their prognostic utility.27
Furthermore, in a recent study of atypical and/or clinically
aggressive IMTs, half of the metastasising cases showed no
atypical features.28 In contrast to ALCL, in which ALK-positive
tumours pursue a less aggressive clinical course, there is no clear￾cut relationship between ALK expression and prognosis in
IMT.28 30 44 75 Recent studies suggest that ALK-positive tumours
have a very low risk of metastasis (if any), but ALK reactivity
does not appear to correlate with recurrence.28 44 75 The role of
p53 reactivity in predicting behaviour of IMTs is uncertain, as
the frequency of p53 immunoexpression has ranged from ,10%
to 80% in various studies, and some investigators have shown a
correlation between p53 positivity and aggressive behaviour,
while others have not.27 28 30 DNA aneuploidy as determined by

DIAGNOSTIC APPROACH AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
Table 1 lists several key points to consider when confronted
with a spindle cell lesion containing a prominent inflammatory
infiltrate. These points should be considered general (not
invariant) guidelines.
In our experience, IMTs are more commonly overdiagnosed
than underdiagnosed. Attention to the clinical context will
often prevent this error—in particular, one should be wary of
making the diagnosis of IMT in a middle-aged or elderly patient.
The anatomical site also provides clues, since these tumours
have a strong predilection for visceral organs and the deep soft
tissues of the abdomen, pelvis, and retroperitoneum. IMT
should be considered a diagnosis of exclusion in the skin and
superficial somatic soft tissues, lymph node, spleen or bladder,
where close histological mimics are more common (see
discussion below). The histological differential diagnosis of
IMT depends in part on the dominant pattern—myxoid/
vascular, compact spindle cell or fibromatosis-like. In general,
immunohistochemistry does not play a major role in confirming
the diagnosis, due to the variable expression and lack of
specificity of myofibroblastic markers. ALK positivity is helpful
if present, but its absence does not exclude the diagnosis of
IMT, particularly in adults. We will first consider the specific
differential diagnosis of IMT based on histological pattern, and
then discuss criteria for the diagnosis at several specific
anatomical sites, focusing on those in which the distinction
between ‘‘inflammatory pseudotumour’’ and IMT is poorly
defined.
The compact spindle cell pattern of IMT is particularly
difficult to distinguish from a variety of histological mimics.
Occasional spindle cell sarcomas, spindle cell melanomas, and
sarcomatoid carcinomas contain a marked inflammatory
infiltrate, and may show only mild cytological atypia.77–79
However, plasma cells are generally not a prominent compo￾nent of the inflammatory infiltrate in these other tumour types,
and most examples show at least focally prominent nuclear
hyperchromasia, atypical mitoses, necrosis or vascular invasion,
all of which are very unusual in IMT. Dedifferentiated
liposarcoma can be particularly challenging, especially on a
biopsy specimen, as morphologically low grade lesions are often
remarkably bland,80–82 and immunohistochemistry for MDM2, a
sensitive marker of dedifferentiated liposarcoma,83 is not helpful
in this distinction, given that a significant proportion of IMTs
show nuclear MDM2 expression.28 30 However, dedifferentiated
liposarcoma usually presents in an older age group than IMT,
and adequate sampling of the mass and adjacent soft tissue will
usually reveal a higher grade component and/or areas of well￾differentiated liposarcoma. Due to their predominance among
mesenchymal tumours of the GI tract and mesentery, gastro￾intestinal stromal tumours (GISTs) may be considered in the
differential diagnosis of cellular IMTs in the abdomen.
However, the palely eosinophilic, syncytial cytoplasm and
cytological uniformity of GISTs contrast with the plump
myofibroblasts, scattered ganglion-like cells and collagenous
background seen in IMT. Furthermore, although an inflamma￾tory infiltrate may be seen in GISTs, it is generally patchy, and
plasma cells are infrequent. Immunohistochemistry is helpful in
this differential diagnosis, as IMTs are consistently negative for
c-kit.11 84 Other entities to consider in the differential diagnosis
of cellular IMTs are dendritic cell neoplasms, which character￾istically show an evenly distributed chronic inflammatory
infiltrate admixed with the spindle cell component.85 Follicular
dendritic cell (FDC) and interdigitating dendritic cell (IDC)
sarcomas are readily distinguished from IMT by immunohis￾tochemistry, as the former express CD21 and/or CD35, and the
latter are uniformly positive for S100 protein. Fibroblastic
reticulum cell (FBRC) tumours are exceptionally rare with only
few reports in the literature, most of which have arisen in
lymph nodes, where IMT is very uncommon.85 86 FBRC tumours
may be histologically indistinguishable from IMT and have a
similar immunoprofile, including variable expression of SMA,
desmin and keratin. Indeed, Rosai et al have recently proposed
that IMTs show fibroblastic reticulum cell, rather than
myofibroblastic, differentiation,87 but this hypothesis remains
speculative. Finally, inflammatory leiomyosarcoma, although a
Figure 7 By immunohistochemistry, 50% of inflammatory
myofibroblastic tumours show expression of ALK, which correlates with
ALK gene rearrangement. ALK expression is inflammatory
myofibroblastic tumours is most common in paediatric and young adult
patients.

rare histological variant, deserves mention, as it shares several
features with IMT, including a predilection for young adults, a
mixed storiform and fascicular spindle cell architecture, and a
prominent inflammatory infiltrate, often with numerous foamy
histiocytes.88 However, focal areas with typical histological
features of leiomyosarcoma—namely, fascicles of spindle cells
with cigar-shaped nuclei and brightly eosinophilic cytoplasm—
can usually be identified.
Fibromatosis-like or hypocellular fibrous IMTs may show
histological overlap with desmoid fibromatosis or calcifying
fibrous tumour, depending on the degree of stromal hyalinisa￾tion. Desmoid fibromatosis, particularly if located in the
mesentery, not infrequently shows focally fasciitis-like features,
enhancing the histological resemblance to IMT. In classic areas,
however, the spindle cells of fibromatosis are arranged in
characteristic long fascicles, in contrast to the short fascicular or
storiform patterns of IMT, and although a lymphocytic
infiltrate may be present in desmoid tumours, plasma cells are
infrequent. Furthermore, these lesions generally show aberrant
nuclear positivity for b-catenin.89 Calcifying fibrous tumour is a
rare benign neoplasm with a predilection for young patients and
a wide anatomical distribution. Some authors have proposed
that this lesion represents a late stage of IMT,90 while others
have found no convincing link between the two entities.62 91
Histologically, calcifying fibrous tumours are uniformly hypo￾cellular, in contrast to the variable cellularity of IMTs, and they
usually contain scattered psammomatous or dystrophic calcifi￾cations.
The principal entity in the differential diagnosis of IMTs
dominated by the myxoid/vascular pattern is nodular fasciitis.
Clinical information is often helpful in this differential, as
nodular fasciitis usually appears rapidly over a few weeks to
months, is rarely larger than a few centimetres in size, and
typically arises in subcutaneous tissue or skeletal muscle, where
IMT is very uncommon. Histologically, IMTs contain a much
more prominent inflammatory infiltrate than nodular fasciitis
and usually show collagenous storiform or fascicular areas,
which are not seen in the latter. Occasionally, reactive processes
dominated by granulation tissue may mimic IMTs with the
myxoid/vascular pattern. In the absence of a supportive clinical
history, histological clues to a reactive/post-traumatic process
include an organised vascular pattern and fat necrosis in the
adjacent soft tissue. Fasciitis-like IMTs arising in the GU tract
should be distinguished from pseudosarcomatous myofibroblas￾tic proliferations (see below).
Inflammatory pseudotumour versus IMT
As discussed above, IMT was formerly buried within the broad
category of non-neoplastic fibroinflammatory and neoplastic
lesions referred to as inflammatory pseudotumour. The use of
these terms synonymously in the literature has led to confusion
regarding the true incidence and behaviour of, and the
diagnostic criteria for, IMT at a variety of sites, particularly
the lung, liver, spleen, lymph node, and bladder.
Pulmonary inflammatory pseudotumour (also often referred
to as plasma cell granuloma) encompasses a variety of entities,
including IMT and post-infectious/reparative processes, of
which the latter are likely more common.2 20 92 93 Twenty to
30% of patients with pulmonary inflammatory pseudotumour
report a history of lower respiratory tract infection, while others
have a history of pulmonary infarcts or prior radiation
therapy.19 20 92 94 Organising pneumonia is frequently identified
within or at the periphery of these lesions,20 92 and many cases
show features not seen in IMT, such as granulomatous
inflammation, abscess formation, and numerous lymphoid
follicles with germinal centres.92 A recent study reported
increased IgG4-positive plasma cells and obliterative phlebitis
in a series of plasma cell-rich pulmonary inflammatory pseudo￾tumours, suggesting that some cases may have an autoimmune
aetiology and form part of the spectrum of the recently
recognised ‘‘systemic IgG4-related sclerosing disease’’.95–97 The
broader age distribution and lower recurrence rate for pulmon￾ary IMT as compared to extrapulmonary tumours18 64 98 may be
due in part to the inclusion of non-neoplastic processes in prior
studies. That said, the lung remains a common site for true
IMT, and, conversely, IMT is one of the most common primary
pulmonary neoplasms in children.94 99
Similar to those in the lung, hepatic ‘‘inflammatory pseudo￾tumours’’ represent a diverse group of lesions with infectious,
autoimmune and neoplastic aetiologies, the latter including
inflammatory pseudotumour-like FDC sarcoma and IMT. A
bacterial or fungal cause has been identified in several cases of
hepatic inflammatory pseudotumour, and in some reports, the
masses resolved following antibiotic therapy.100–102 Prior reports
of EBV in hepatic inflammatory pseudotumours are now
believed primarily to represent inflammatory pseudotumour￾like FDC sarcomas.103–105 This distinctive variant of FDC
sarcoma characteristically arises in the liver and spleen of
female patients, frequently presents with systemic symptoms,
and shows a consistent association with EBV.105 Histologically,
inflammatory pseudotumour-like FDC sarcomas are composed
of spindle cells with vesicular nuclei and palely eosinophilic
cytoplasm and show a marked lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate,
thus closely mimicking IMT. Immunohistochemistry is often
required to distinguish between these two neoplasms: the
spindle cells of inflammatory pseudotumour-like FDC sarcoma
express at least one of the FDC markers (CD21, CD23, and
CD35), are negative for ALK, and are consistently positive for
EBER (EBV-encoded mRNA).105 Finally, recent studies suggest
that hepatic inflammatory pseudotumours dominated by
lymphoplasmacytic inflammation with a minimal myofibro￾blastic component may be a manifestation of the systemic
IgG4-related sclerosing disease (see above).106 107 Similar to the
pancreatic lesions associated with this disorder (‘‘autoimmune’’
or lymphoplasmacytic sclerosing pancreatitis), the ‘‘lympho￾plasmacytic type’’ of hepatic inflammatory pseudotumour
consistently shows increased IgG4-positive plasma cells, oblit￾erative phlebitis, and periductal inflammation with concentric
fibrosis, whereas these findings are less common or absent in the
‘‘fibrohistiocytic type’’ of hepatic inflammatory pseudotu￾mour.107
Inflammatory pseudotumour of lymph node and spleen is a
non-neoplastic entity distinct from IMT. Most affected patients
are adults, and those with lymph node lesions frequently pre￾sent with systemic symptoms and/or laboratory abnormalities
similar to those seen in a minority of patients with IMT.108–111
Inflammatory pseudotumour of lymph node has a characteristic
distribution, preferentially involving the connective tissue frame￾work of the node (the capsule, trabeculae, and hilum) without
forming a discrete mass, although in later stages, the lesion may
efface the nodal architecture.110 Vascular changes, including
perivascular fibrosis and vasculitis, are often seen within med￾ium-sized vessels of the hilum or capsule, and extension into
perinodal soft tissue is common.109–111 EBV has been detected in
small lymphocytes in several cases of nodal inflammatory
pseudotumour, but the spindle cells are EBV negative.37 109 In
contrast to nodal lesions, splenic inflammatory pseudotumours are
often asymptomatic, form a discrete mass, and usually lack

associated vascular changes.39 108 109 Furthermore, splenic lesions are
rarely associated with nodal lesions and vice versa, suggesting that
the two entities may be biologically unrelated, despite their
histological similarities.108 Some investigators have detected EBV in
the spindle cells of a subset of splenic inflammatory pseudotu￾mours,37–39 whereas others reported no evidence of EBV infection.109
The spindle cells in some of the EBV-positive cases also expressed
FDC markers,37 39 and thus represent EBV-associated inflamma￾tory pseudotumour-like FDC tumours, as discussed above.
Inflammatory pseudotumours of lymph node and spleen are
consistently negative for ALK.11 39 109
The family of idiopathic fibrosclerosing lesions, including
sclerosing mesenteritis, idiopathic retroperitoneal fibrosis, scler￾osing mediastinitis, and orbital inflammatory pseudotumour,
may also be considered within the umbrella of inflammatory
pseudotumour. These lesions may occur synchronously or
metachronously in the same patient.112 113 Recently, an associa￾tion with elevated serum IgG4 levels and other autoimmune
disorders, particularly autoimmune pancreatitis, has been
described in some patients with fibrosclerosing diseases,
suggesting that a subset of these cases may be manifestations
of the systemic IgG4-related sclerosing disease mentioned above
in the discussion of pulmonary and hepatic inflammatory
pseudotumours.96 97 114 Grossly, the mass lesions formed by these
processes are ill-defined and often encase adjacent structures, in
contrast to the relatively circumscribed margins of IMT.
Microscopically, the spindle cell component of fibrosclerosing
lesions is usually significantly less cellular than that seen in even
the most hypocellular IMTs, and the storiform, fascicular and
myxoid/vascular patterns of IMT are absent. In addition, the
inflammatory infiltrate is often patchy and perivascular, in
contrast to the diffuse infiltrate seen in IMTs, and lymphocytic
infiltration of blood vessel walls may be present in up to 50% of
cases.113 115
Finally, perhaps the most confusing topic in the recent
literature on IMT is the distinction between pseudosarcoma￾tous myofibroblastic proliferations (PMPs) and IMTs in the GU
tract. Pseudosarcomatous spindle cell lesions in the GU tract
have been described under a variety of names, including
pseudosarcomatous fibromyxoid tumour, inflammatory pseu￾dotumour, pseudosarcomatous myofibroblastic tumour/prolif￾eration, pseudomalignant spindle cell proliferation, and
postoperative spindle cell nodule for those arising following
instrumentation.116–123 There are no histological differences
between those that occur following trauma and those that
arise spontaneously, the latter being more common.124 125 PMP
usually occurs in adults, is not associated with systemic
symptoms, and may recur locally in 10–20% of cases but does
not metastasise.124 125 Although some authors do not distinguish
between IMT and PMP in the GU tract,126 127 we and
others42 124 125 128 believe that they are distinct entities that are
separable on morphological grounds, and, in our experience,
most fasciitis-like myofibroblastic lesions in the GU tract are
PMPs. Histologically, PMPs are composed of a haphazard to
loose fascicular arrangement of spindle cells, many of which
have elongated bipolar cytoplasmic processes that are often
brightly eosinophilic, mimicking rhabdomyoblasts.120 121 124 The
stroma is typically oedematous to myxoid with prominent
vascularity and a variably dense acute and/or chronic inflam￾matory infiltrate.124 125 PMP may show focally more cellular
fascicular areas, particularly in the deeper portion of the lesion
away from the mucosal surface, but the storiform and
hypocellular fibrous patterns of IMT are rarely seen. In addition,
the inflammatory infiltrate of PMP is generally less dense than
that seen in IMT and lacks a prominent plasma cell
component.124 125 As both IMT and PMP are myofibroblastic in
nature, there is considerable immunohistochemical overlap
between the two lesions. PMP expresses SMA in approximately
70% of cases, desmin in 35–60%, keratin in 42–94%, and may
also be positive for ALK, although the molecular basis for this is
unclear.124 125 One study documented ALK positivity in 10 of 21
PMPs, but found no evidence of ALK gene rearrangement in the
6 ALK-positive cases examined by FISH.124 Another group
similarly found ALK expression in nearly 50% of PMPs (12 of
26) but also identified ALK gene rearrangements in 4 of the 6
ALK-positive cases examined, raising the possibility that these
lesions may be neoplastic.125 Alternatively, this study (and
others) may have included a heterogeneous group of lesions,
both PMPs and ‘‘true’’ IMTs. However, there are certainly rare
examples of bona fide IMTs that arise in the region of the
bladder. Although the aetiology of PMP (reactive or neoplastic)
and its possible relationship to IMT remain controversial, we
believe there is sufficient data with respect to differences in
clinical behaviour to warrant their separation.
In summary, IMT is a distinctive myofibroblastic neoplasm
that has a predilection for the lung, abdomen, and pelvis of
children and young adults, shows a tendency for local
recurrence, and shows a characteristic cytogenetic abnormality
in approximately half of the cases. IMTs should be distin￾guished from the variety of neoplastic and reactive lesions
included under the umbrella term ‘‘inflammatory pseudotu￾mour’’. To avoid ambiguity, the latter designation is best
avoided, with the exception of inflammatory pseudotumour of
lymph node and spleen and orbital inflammatory pseudotu￾mour, which are distinct clinicopathological entities. Finally,
one should keep in mind that IMT is a diagnosis of exclusion in
middle-aged or older adults, and in skin and somatic soft tissue,
and the presence of nuclear hyperchromasia, atypical mitoses, or
more than mild nuclear atypia argues strongly against the
diagnosis.
