Hepatitis E Virus 
Seroprevalence 
among Men Who 
Have Sex with Men, 
United Kingdom
To the Editor: Immunosuppres￾sion might be associated with chronic 
carriage of hepatitis E virus (HEV) 
(1,2). HIV-infected persons could be 
at increased risk for HEV acquisition 
(3). If HIV infection is a risk factor for 
HEV, the risk will probably be medi￾ated by associated behavioral factors. 
Men who have sex with men (MSM) 
are known to be at risk for transmission 
of enteric infection (4). Because of in￾creasing prevalence of chronic liver dis￾ease induced by various causes among 
HIV-infected persons, it is necessary to 
determine whether these patients are at 
risk for HEV acquisition and possible 
hepatic decompensation (5).
We aimed to establish the con￾tribution of HIV infection and MSM 
to seroprevalence of HEV among 
banked serum specimens. We used an 
unlinked, anonymous HIV seropreva￾lence survey of sexual health clinic at￾tendees in England, Wales, and North￾ern Ireland, compared results from 
testing of residual serum samples col￾lected for routine syphilis testing from 
sentinel clinics, and analyzed basic 
epidemiologic data (6). We exam￾ined serum samples collected during a 
3-year period (2006–2008) and stored 
at −80°C. All samples were from male 
patients, 20–44 years of age. IgG 
against HEV was measured by using 
ELISA (Wantai; Fortress Diagnostics, 
Antrim, UK). To further increase the 
specificity for a seroprevalence analy￾sis, and in accordance with previous 
work (7), we defined only samples 
with an optical density/cutoff value 
>1.5 as reactive and those in the range 
1.0–1.5 as weakly reactive.
We analyzed 422 serum samples 
collected during 2008, comprising 
146 samples from MSM with positive 
HIV test results, 135 from MSM with 
negative HIV test results, and 141 
from heterosexual men with negative 
HIV test results. Thirty (7.1%) serum 
samples showed IgG reactivity against 
HEV and 3 (0.7%) additional samples 
showed weak reactivity. We examined 
the effect of HIV infection on preva￾lence of IgG against HEV by compar￾ing samples from HIV-infected MSM 
with those from HIV-negative MSM . 
Seroprevalence rates did not differ sig￾nificantly (HIV-positive MSM 7.5%; 
HIV-negative MSM 10.4%; p = 0.4). 
We then examined the effect of 
being MSM as a risk factor for HEV 
infection. Prevalence of IgG against 
HEV among HIV-negative hetero￾sexual men was 3.5%, significantly 
lower than that among MSM (odds 
ratio 3.1, p = 0.025, for comparison 
with non-HIV–infected MSM). We 
examined the relationship of status of 
IgG against HEV among MSM to the 
presence of an acute non-HIV sexu￾ally transmitted infection (STI) at the 
time of serum sampling. No associa￾tion was found (acute STI, 14 [9.1%] 
of 154 vs. no acute STI, 11 [8.7%] of 
127; p = 0.9). Similarly, no statistical 
association was found between HEV 
antibody status and the location of the 
clinic that provided the serum sample 
(London, 21 [10.0%] of 211; United 
Kingdom excluding London, 4 [5.7%)] 
of 70; p = 0.3). As has been observed 
for the general UK population (7), we

LETTERS
observed a trend toward increasing 
prevalence of antibodies against HEV 
with patient age (20–34 y, 9 [6.3%] 
of 142; 35–44 y, 16 [11.5%] of 139), 
although this trend did not reach sig￾nificance (p = 0.13). Our samples were 
from persons who were younger than 
the previously described cohort of UK 
persons with increased prevalence of 
antibodies against HEV (born before 
approximately1960) (7). Multivari￾ate analysis with the above variables 
showed that MSM (p = 0.044) and age 
group (p = 0.026) were independently 
associated with HEV seroprevalence. 
To explore recent temporal trends in 
HEV seroprevalence among MSM, 
we examined serum samples from 
977 MSM collected during the 3-year 
study period. We observed an unex￾pected association between antibody 
prevalence and year of serum collec￾tion (2006, 4 [2.1%] of195; 2007, 26 
[5.2%] of 501; 2008, 26 [9.3%] of 
281; p = 0.003 (Figure).
We provide evidence that MSM 
might be at risk for HEV acquisition 
and confirm that HIV infection does not 
appear to be a risk factor. Although our 
study is of moderate size, and we have 
limited epidemiologic data owing to its 
unlinked, anonymized nature, the fact 
that patient groups are drawn from the 
same clinics should minimize the effect 
of unrecognized confounding factors. 
The pathologic mechanisms for HEV 
acquisition among MSM may plausi￾bly include oro–anal sexual practices, 
which have been implicated in recent 
outbreaks of Shigella flexneri infec￾tion in this group (8). That ano–genital 
transmission of HEV is unlikely is sup￾ported by our finding that prevalence 
of antibodies against HEV was not 
more common among patients with an 
acute STI.
The shift in prevalence of anti￾bodies against HEV among MSM oc￾curred while HEV activity in the Unit￾ed Kingdom was increasing (9,10). 
The routes of transmission of indig￾enously acquired HEV infection in in￾dustrialized countries remain a subject 
of investigation, but our observations 
suggest that activity among MSM 
could expose this group to increased 
transmission. Thus, the putative com￾bination of increased exposure in the 
general UK population and increased 
transmission among MSM suggests 
that HEV incidence and seropreva￾lence could increase for this group 
in the near future and couldbecome a 
substantial public health problem.

Imported 
Hepatitis E Virus, 
Central African 
Republic, 2011
To the Editor: Hepatitis E virus 
(HEV) is endemic to India (1,2) and 
Central African Republic (3,4), al￾though different strains circulate in 
the countries. In May 2011, a case of 
jaundice and fever in an expatriate In￾dian worker (a 33-year-old man) was 
reported to Institut Pasteur de Bangui, 
Bangui, Central African Republic. 
HEV RNA and IgM were detected in 
serum samples from the patient, and 
liver enzyme levels were raised (ala￾nine aminotransferase 840 U/L, ref￾erence value 11–66 U/L). Symptoms 
lasted for ≈10 days and resolved with￾out specific treatment. The patient was 
working and living at a construction 
site in Central African Republic with 
51 other men (22–62 years of age) 
from India.
 We investigated this case to de￾termine whether it was linked to an 
outbreak and whether disease-control 
measures were needed. The protocol 
for surveillance and investigation was 
approved by the national ethical and 
scientific committee in Central Afri￾can Republic.
Background information and 
blood and stool samples were obtained 
from the patient’s coworkers. The 
Bioelisa HEV IgM 3.0 kit (Biokit, Bar￾celona, Spain), which has sensitivity 
>98%, was used to test serum samples 
for HEV IgM; real-time reverse tran￾scription PCR (rRT-PCR) was used to 
test serum and stool samples for viral 
RNA (5). Test results provided evi￾dence of early HEV infection. Liver 
enzymes (aspartate aminotransferase 
and alanine aminotransferase) were 
measured in serum by using an ABX 
Pentra 400 benchtop analyzer (Horiba 
Medical, Montpellier, France). 
For genetic analysis of HEV 
strains from viremic study participants, 
we performed nested RT-PCR on serum 
and stool samples to amplify a 348-bp 
portion of the open reading frame 2 re￾gion (6). We directly sequenced the pu￾rified amplicons and compared the re￾sulting sequences with HEV sequences 
in GenBank (7) and those from autoch￾thonous HEV cases from 2008–2011. 
ClustalW2 (www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/
clustalw2/) was used to align sequenc￾es. MEGA5 (8) was used to construct 
a phylogenetic tree (300-nt sequences) 
by the neighbor-joining method. The 
genotypes and subtypes were identified 
as described (7).
The 52 men arrived in Central 
African Republic in several groups 
during July 2010–June 2011. During 
May–July 2011, a total of 40 (77%) 
men had a febrile illness; 9 illnesses 
were accompanied by digestive signs 
or symptoms, such as nausea and 
vomiting (Technical Appendix Table, 
wwwnc.cdc.gov/EID/article/12-0670-
Techapp1.pdf). Only the patient whose 
case was reported was jaundice. Early 
HEV infection was biologically con￾firmed for 11 (21%) men, including 
the -patient whose case was reported; 
8 of the 11 men had IgM only, 1 was 
HEV positive according to rRT-PCR 
and IgM negative, and 2 were HEV 
positive according to rRT-PCR and 
IgM positive. The 2 other men with 
viremia were asymptomatic, but liv￾er enzyme levels were elevated in 1 
of them. 
Illnesses in infected and nonin￾fected men did not differ, and, ex￾cept for the notified case, we cannot 
say with certainty that the illnesses 
were caused by HEV. We found IgG 
against HEV in 14 (34%) uninfected 
men, which is close to the preva￾lence for the general population in 
India (2).
HEV subtype 1a isolates from 
the notified case-patient (serum-de￾rived isolate) and a co-worker (stool￾derived isolate) were sequenced 
(GenBank accession nos. JN863908 
and JQ074213, respectively) and 
found to be 100% similar and to share 
97%– 99% similarity with other HEV 
strains in India and Nepal (Techni￾cal Appendix Figure). The sequences 
obtained from persons with autoch￾thonous HEV (GenBank accession 
nos. JN863909, JN863910, and 
JQ740782) clustered with HEV sub￾type 1e and type 2 strains and were 
closely related to strains from Africa 
and Mexico (93% and 82% similar￾ity, respectively). Similarity between 
strains was not as high for the strain 
from the notified case-patient and 
those from persons with autochtho￾nous infection (87% similarity with 
the subtype 1e strain and 77% simi￾larity with the type 2 strain).
IgM titers typically rise after the 
incubation period, which is >3 weeks 
for HEV (9). Thus, for the purpose of 
this study, we assumed that men who
