Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is endemic in Asia, the Pacific
islands, Africa, Southern Europe, and Latin America. In Asian
countries, the majority of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients
acquire the virus in the perinatal period or early childhood
through vertical (mother to child) transmission; by contrast,
horizontal transmission is the main route in African and
Western countries.1 Long-term outcomes of CHB vary widely.
Several viral factors, including HBV genotype, viral load, spe￾cific viral mutations, and quantitative hepatitis B surface
antigen (qHBsAg) levels, have been shown to predict clinical
outcomes in both community- and hospital-based cohort
studies.2,3 However, the precise role of HBV genotype in liver
disease progression and response to antiviral therapy remains
to be validated. Accordingly, HBV genotyping is still not
recommended as a part of CHB management in the interna￾tional guidelines.4,5 In this article, recent advances regarding
the impact of HBV genotype on the clinical outcomes in
patients with chronic HBV infection are reviewed. In addition,
the interactions between HBV genotype and other viral factors,
such as viral load and qHBsAg levels, are also discussed.

Abstract Clinical outcomes of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection vary widely. In addition to host
factors, several viral factors including HBV genotype, viral load, specific viral mutations and
quantitative HBsAg levels, have been associated with disease outcomes. Among viral
factors, HBV genotype correlates with not only the clinical outcomes, but also with the
response to interferon treatment. Currently, 10 HBV genotypes have been identified.
Compared with genotype A and B cases, patients with genotypes C and D have lower rates
and usually delayed onset of spontaneous HBeAg seroconversion. HBV-genotype C has a
higher frequency of basal core promoter (BCP) A1762T/G1764A mutation and preS
deletion, and a higher viral load than genotype B. Similarly, genotype D has a higher
prevalence of BCPA1762T/G1764A mutation than genotype A. These observations suggest
pathogenic differences between HBV genotypes. Genotyping of HBV can help practicing
physicians identify chronic hepatitis B patients at risk of disease progression.

subtypes have been identified: > 8% for genotypes and 4 to
8% for subtypes.6–8 Except for the newly identified genotypes
I and J, the geographic and ethnic distributions of HBV
genotypes and subtypes are well characterized. Genotype
A is highly prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa, Northern Europe,
and Western Africa. Genotypes B and C are common in Asia.
Genotype C mainly exists in East and Southeast Asia. Geno￾type D is prevalent in Africa, Europe, the Mediterranean
region and India. Genotype E is restricted to West Africa.
Genotype F is found in Central and South America. Genotype
G has been reported in France, Germany, and the United
States. Genotype H is found in Central America.6–10 Recently,
genotype I, a novel intergenotypic recombination among
genotypes A, C, and G, was isolated in Vietnam and
Laos.11,12 The newest HBV genotype, J, was identified in
the Ryukyu Islands in Japan. This genotype has a close
relationship with gibbon/orangutan genotypes and human
genotype C.13
Geographic distribution of HBV genotype may correlate
with the modes of transmission. For example, genotypes B
and C are prevalent in highly endemic areas where perina￾tal or vertical transmission plays an important role in
the viral spreading, whereas the remaining genotypes are
frequently found in areas where horizontal transmission
is the main mode of transmission. Therefore, HBV
genotyping can serve as an epidemiologic tool for the
investigation of transmission, as well as geographic evolu￾tion of HBV.14
Clinical Significance of HBV Genotype in the
Natural History of HBV Infection
Toward Chronicity after Acute HBV Infection
Recent studies suggested that acute infection with HBV
genotype A was associated with a higher risk of developing
chronic infection.15,16 In Japan, the persistence of HBV infec￾tion after acute hepatitis B was higher in patients with
genotype A (23%) than those with genotype B (11%) or C
(7%) infection.16 The rate of chronicity after acute genotype D
infection has also been reported to be relatively high.17
Notably, an increase of certain HBV genotype after acute
infection would result in redistribution of HBV genotypes
among patients with chronic HBV infection in countries
where universal hepatitis B vaccination has not yet been
launched (►Table 1). For example, in a nationwide survey,
Matsuura et al found that the prevalence of HBV genotype A in
chronic hepatitis B patients in Japan increased from 1.7% in
2000 to 3.5% in 2006.18
Emergence of HBeAg Seroconversion and HBsAg
Seroclearance
Seroconversion of hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) and sero￾clearance of HBsAg have been recognized as important
events in the natural history of chronic HBV infection, with
an estimated annual incidence rate of 12% and 2%, respec￾tively.19–21 Earlier HBeAg seroconversion usually confers a
favorable clinical outcome, whereas late or absent HBeAg
seroconversion after multiple hepatitis flares is likely to be
responsible for the progression from chronic hepatitis to
cirrhosis.22 In our previous observations, CHB patients with
HBV genotype C infection were more likely to remain positive
for HBeAg despite multiple hepatitis flares,23 and had a lower
likelihood of spontaneous HBeAg seroconversion than those
with genotype B infection. Consistent data were found in a
cohort of 460 Taiwanese children with chronic HBV infec￾tion.24 Besides, the mean age at HBeAg seroconversion in
HBV genotype C patients was generally one decade older
than that in genotype B patients.20,25 Taking these lines of
evidence together, HBV genotype C patients may experience
delayed HBeAg seroconversion and a lengthier period of
active HBV replication than genotype B patients. With these
unfavorable features, genotype C patients are prone to
develop advanced fibrosis, cirrhosis, and even HCC than
genotype B patients. Similar findings on HBV genotype C
versus B patients have been reported from China, Hong Kong,
and Japan.26–29
Regarding genotypes A and D, one prospective study
evaluated the clinical outcomes of 258 Spanish patients
with chronic HBV infection; mean follow-up was
94 months.30 Although no difference was observed in the
probability of HBeAg seroconversion between HBV genotype
A and D patients, the rate of sustained remission after HBeAg
seroconversion was higher in genotype A than genotype D
patients (55% vs. 32%, p < 0.01).
As for spontaneous HBsAg seroclearance, compared with
genotypes C and D patients, genotype A and B patients had a
higher rate of HBsAg seroclearance.30,31 Overall, these facts
suggest that the clinical phenotypes differ between geno￾types B and C, as well as between genotypes A and D during
the early phase of chronic HBV infection.
Disease Progression to Cirrhosis or Hepatocellular
Carcinoma
In addition to retrospective or case-control studies, a com￾munity-based prospective cohort study on 2,762 Taiwanese
HBV carriers demonstrated that HBV genotype C was associ￾ated with an increased risk of HCC than was genotype B; the
adjusted hazard ratio (HR) was 2.35 (95% confidence interval
[CI] 1.68 to 3.30; p < 0.001).32 Of interest, several reports
showed HBV genotype B was associated with early-onset HCC,
whereas genotype C was associated with the development of
HCC at an older age.24,33 The predominance of HBV genotype
B in HCC patients was more prominent in those younger than
35 years, and most were noncirrhotic.
In addition to the differential hepatocarcinogenesis, HBV
genotype also influences the clinicopathological features of
patients with HCC. In Taiwan, among 193 patients with
resectable HBV-related HCC, genotype B patients had a
higher rate of solitary tumor (94% vs. 86%, p ¼ 0.048), but
more satellite nodules (22% vs. 12%, p ¼ 0.05) than genotype
C patients.34 These characteristics may contribute to the
recurrence patterns and prognosis of HBV-related HCC pa￾tients with genotype B or C infection.34,35 However, a recent
case-control study showed that the distribution of HBV
genotype was not different between early and nonearly￾HCC patients.36

Interactions between HBV Genotypes,
Viral Load, and Viral Mutants
Accumulating data reveal that HBV viral load and viral
mutations are closely associated with long-term outcomes
of HBV-related chronic liver diseases.37,38 In an earlier study,
we found that genotype C infections conferred a higher
frequency of basal core promoter (BCP) A1762T/G1764A
mutation than genotype B. In another prospective study
with 4,841 Taiwanese male HBsAg carriers without HCC at
enrollment, Yu et al found that HBV viral load was higher in
genotype C than genotype B patients. Genotype C-infected
patients with high viral loads had a 26-fold higher risk of HCC
than those with other genotypes and low or undetectable
viral loads.39 Furthermore, Yang et al reported that among
those infected with HBV genotype C, wild-type precore 1896
sequence and BCP A1762T/G1764A mutation were associated
with a highest risk of HCC during 13-year follow-up. The
adjusted HR was 2.99 (95% CI 1.57–5.70, p < 0.001) relative to
those with genotype B infection, wild-type precore 1896 and
BCP sequences.32 Similarly, genotype D infected patients who
had more progressive liver disease had a higher prevalence of
BCP A1762T/G1764A mutation than those with genotype A
infection.40
Previous reports also showed that deletions within the
preS gene may contribute to progressive liver cell damage
and hepatocarcinogenesis.41 In our recent case-control
study, the frequency of preS deletion was significantly higher
in genotype C patients than genotype B patients. In addition,
the presence of preS deletion was an independent risk factor
associated with disease progression (odds ratio [OR], 3.91;
95% CI 1.57–9.76, p ¼ 0.003) as well as HCC development
(OR, 3.72; 95% CI 1.44–9.65; p ¼ 0.007).42 A meta-analysis
further confirmed that the OR of HCC for preS deletion was
3.77 (95% CI 2.57–5.52). Of particular note, the summary OR
for preS deletion was higher in genotype C patients than
genotype B patients.43 Additional investigations demonstrat￾ed that the combination of viral load, HBV genotype, BCP
A1762T/G1764A mutation, and preS deletion is strongly
associated with disease progression and development of
HCC.32,44,45
Recently, several clinical scoring systems or nomograms
incorporating independent risk predictors such as sex, age,
family history of HCC, alcohol consumption, serum alanine
aminotransferase (ALT) level, HBeAg status, serum HBV
DNA level, and/or HBV genotype have been developed.46–48
These easy-to-use nomograms are based on noninvasive
clinical parameters and have been found to accurately
predict HCC risk in either community- or hospital-based
HBV-infected patients. These risk calculators would
facilitate communication between practicing physicians
and patients in the daily practice. However, the predictive
value of these scoring systems in populations with
different ethnicities or genotype infections needs to be
validated.

Clinical Significance of Quantitative HBsAg
and Its Correlation with HBV Genotypes
qHBsAg Level Predicts Loss of HBsAg
and Development of HCC
In recent years, qHBsAg level has been documented to
influence the clinical outcomes of chronic HBV infec￾tion.49–51 For example, the association of HBsAg and HBV
DNA levels with subsequent HBsAg loss were investigated in
a cohort of 688 HBeAg-negative Taiwanese patients with
baseline serum HBV DNA levels < 2000 IU/mL.50 We found
that baseline HBsAg level, but not HBV DNA, was an inde￾pendent factor for the loss of HBsAg in multivariate analysis.
The adjusted HR of HBsAg loss was 13.2 (95% CI 7.8–22.1) for
HBsAg level < 10 versus  1,000 IU/mL. Besides, we fol￾lowed 390 Taiwanese HBeAg-positive patients with chronic
hepatitis who had spontaneous HBeAg seroconversion
(Study of E Antigen seRoClearance of Hepatitis B [SERACH￾B] cohort). We found that serum levels of HBsAg and HBV
DNA at 1 year after HBeAg seroconversion were inversely
associated with HBsAg loss in a dose–response manner.
Compared with patients with HBsAg levels  1,000 IU/mL,
the HBsAg loss rate was higher for those with HBsAg levels of
100 to 999 and < 100 IU/mL, with HRs of 4.4 (95% CI 1.1–17.0)
and 24.3 (95% CI 8.7–67.5), respectively.49 An HBsAg level
< 100 IU/mL predicted HBsAg loss within 6 years with a
diagnostic accuracy of 91.5%, sensitivity of 83.3%, specificity
of 92.1%, positive predictive value of 45.5%, and negative
predictive value of 98.6% in patients with an HBV DNA level
< 200 IU/mL.
Finally, the REVEAL-HBV (Risk Evaluation of Viral Load
Evaluation and Associated Liver Disease/Cancer-Hepatitis B
Virus) cohort demonstrated that adult HBsAg carriers with
serum HBV DNA levels > 10,000 copies/mL will have a
significantly higher risk of developing HCC than carriers
with serum HBV DNA  10,000 copies/mL. To be noted,
carriers with serum HBV DNA < 10,000 copies/mL are still
at risk of HCC development. To address whether higher levels
of HBsAg increase risk for HCC in this subpopulation, we
followed 2,688 Taiwanese HBsAg-positive patients without
evidence of cirrhosis for a mean period of 14.7 years (Eluci￾dation of Risk Factors for Disease Control or Advancement in
Taiwanese Hepatitis B Carriers [ERADICATE-B] cohort). We
found that baseline levels of HBsAg and HBV DNA levels were
associated with development of HCC. For HBeAg-negative
patients with levels of HBV DNA < 2,000 IU/mL, factors that
determined HCC risk included sex, age, and levels of ALT and
HBsAg ( 1,000 IU/mL). Multivariate analysis showed that the
adjusted HR for HCC in patients with levels of HBsAg  1,000
IU/mL versus <1000 IU/mL was 13.7 (95% CI 4.8–39.3).51 Our
data strongly suggested that among HBeAg-negative patients
with low viral loads, the HCC risk is the lowest in patients with
serum HBsAg levels < 1,000 IU/mL. These patients can thus be
designated “minimal risk HBV carriers.”
All these data suggest that low serum levels of HBsAg,
alone or in combination with HBV DNA levels reliably predict
the long-term clinical outcomes of chronic HBV infection,
including the favorable HBsAg seroclearance in both HBeAg￾negative and HBeAg-positive populations, and the unfavor￾able development of HCC.
Correlations Among HBV DNA Level, qHBsAg
Level, and HBV Genotype
Recent data further revealed the correlations among serum
HBV DNA level, serum HBsAg level, and HBV genotype. A small
study evaluated the correlation between HBV DNA and HBsAg
level according to HBV genotype in 80 patients with chronic
hepatitis B. They found that serum HBsAg level tended to
correlate with HBV DNA level for genotype A (correlation
coefficient ¼ 0.44, p ¼ 0.02); however, such correlation was
not significant for genotypes D (ρ ¼ 0.29, p ¼ 0.15). We
recently followed up 187 patients with chronic HBV infection
for a median of 8 years. We found that inactive carriers had a
significant lower HBsAg at baseline and during follow-up
compared with patients with elevated serum HBV DNA levels.
In contrast to previous findings, the longitudinal HBsAg
change was independent of genotype B or C, the most
common genotype in Taiwan. More studies are needed to
clarify the relationships among HBV genotype, viral loads, and
qHBsAg level in different clinical situations.
In addition to the untreated cohort, we also investigated
the correlation between the declines of HBsAg level and HBV
genotype in 32 HBeAg-positive patients receiving interferon
(IFN) therapy. After IFN treatment, both serum HBV DNA and
HBsAg levels decreased significantly in genotype B, but not
genotype C patients. The posttreatment intrahepatic HBsAg
level also significantly decreased in HBV genotype B patients.
These preliminary results demonstrated genotype-depen￾dent declines of both serum and intrahepatic HBsAg levels
after IFN treatment.
Summary and Perspectives
Over the past decade, we have witnessed advances in research
on clinical implications of HBV genotype. Based on accumu￾lating lines of evidence, it is recommended that patients with
chronic HBV infection should be routinely genotyped to help
identify those who are at higher risk of disease progression.52
In the foreseeable future, prospective studies including geno￾type-stratified clinical trials will be required to validate the
value of HBV genotype, and the complementary value of HBV
genotype, viral load, and qHBsAg level in our clinical practice.
