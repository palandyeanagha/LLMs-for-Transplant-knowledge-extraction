Abstract
Background: The epidemic of diabetic nephropathy (DN) has been paralleled by rapid increases in both obesity
and diabetes in China. The aim of this study was to investigate the natural history of DN and the association of
obesity and renal function with diabetes.
Methods: In total, 264 patients with renal biopsy-confirmed DN were examined from 2002 to 2008 and followed
up to June 2008 in our institute. Among these, 129 patients were classified into a Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality
Initiative (K/DOQI) stage I subgroup. Weight status, clinico-histopathological features, the development of end-stage
renal disease (ESRD) and increased proteinuria were evaluated at the baseline of biopsy and during the follow up.
Lean, overweight and obese phenotypes were defined as body mass index (BMI) less than 25 kg/m2
, 25–28 kg/m2
,
and more than 28 kg/m2 over, respectively.
Results: In the patients with renal biopsy-confirmed DN, BMI was 25.5 ± 3.39 kg/m2
, with 122 (46.2%), 83 (31.4%) and
59 (22.3%) having lean, overweight and obese phenotypes, respectively. Mean proteinuria was 3.09 ± 2.32 g/24 h,
serum creatinine was 2.02 ± 2.02 mg/dL, and creatinine clearance rate (Ccr) was 96.0 ± 54.0 mL/min/1.73 m2
. Compared
with obese patients, lean patients had a lower Ccr, a higher percentage of anemia, more renal lesions and higher risk
for ESRD (HR = 1.812, P = 0.048). The weight in obese patients decreased significantly after 27 months, and lean patients
had a longer duration of diabetes than obese patients. Regarding patients at K/DOQI stage I, patients with DN showed
similar duration of diabetes regardless of weight status. Minimal weight loss was recorded in obese patients during
follow-up, and they exhibited greater glomerular hyperfiltration and higher risk for increased proteinuria (HR = 2.872,
P = 0.014) than lean patients.
Conclusions: In China, obesity is common in DN patients undergoing biopsy. Initial high levels of proteinuria and
subsequent weight loss are the major characteristics of the natural course of DN. Obesity contributed to increased
proteinuria at an early stage, while the lean phenotype was associated with ESRD development, especially at the later
stages.

Background
Obesity has become a serious worldwide problem. More
than 300 million adults are classified as obese and the glo￾bal number is predicted to reach 700 million by 2015. In
the past, obesity was not a common condition among the
population of China; however, this is no longer the case
[1]. Obesity and diabetes have become a growing chal￾lenge, and one million new diabetic cases are reported in
China every year. Increasing evidence suggests that obesity
is a risk factor for diabetes and chronic kidney diseases.
As a marker of obesity, high body mass index (BMI) has
been reported to be related with diabetic nephropathy
(DN) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) [2]. A high
prevalence of DN and ESRD has recently been demon￾strated among Asians. During the past two decades, the
prevalence of DN has dramatically increased in China
[3,4], although the obesity profile among DN patients and
the natural history of DN are not available in this region.
Obesity has been shown to aggravate renal injury asso￾ciated with diabetes, although this effect is not consist￾ent in previous studies. The evidence indicating a * Correspondence: chenhuimei@nju.edu.cn; zhihong–liu@hotmail.com

relationship between obesity and ESRD is paradoxical
[5,6]. Tokashiki et al. showed that decreased BMI was
the independent risk factor for chronic kidney disease,
and the effect of obesity on renal survival varied with
ethnicity [1,7]. Without intensive analysis, the possible
role of obesity and weight loss on kidney function is still
uncertain among Chinese patients with DN.
The first aim of our study was to explore the natural
history of DN in Chinese patients. The second aim was
to examine the impact of obesity on renal function in
such a population. We screened patients presenting with
type 2 diabetes, proteinuria, and biopsy-confirmed DN
in our institute, and demonstrated an association of the
obesity, weight loss with DN, and BMI with renal injury
at different stages of diabetes. Obesity and overweight
were defined according to the criteria outlined by the
Working Group on Obesity of China [8]. The renal
stages were evaluated by K/DOQI (Kidney Disease Out￾comes Quality Initiative) guidelines.
Methods
Study population
Information on 15,141 cases was retrieved from patients,
who underwent renal biopsy at a single unit during the
period from July 2002 to June 2008 (Research Institute
of Nephrology, Nanjing University School of Medicine,
P.R. China). In this institute, the indications for renal bi￾opsy included proteinuria and/or hematuria and/or renal
insufficiency, with or without coexisting systemic disease
[9]. The biopsies were performed by a group of clini￾cians, and renal biopsy specimens were examined by ex￾perienced nephrologists using techniques including light
microscopy, immunohistology, and electron microscopy.
Final diagnosis was made on the basis of clinical and
histological features.
Written informed consent was obtained from all sub￾jects prior to participation in the experimental protocol.
The study was approved by the institutional review
board of Nanjing University School of Medicine, and
consistent with the Declaration of Helsinki. Initially, 757
patients with renal biopsy-confirmed DN were included,
according to the following criteria: 1) type 2 diabetes
mellitus (Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes, 2008,
ADA [10]); 2) urinary protein excretion >400 mg/24 h;
and 3) typical DN lesions in the glomeruli, tubulo￾interstitium or blood vessels [11]. Patients with con￾comitant conditions such as IgA nephropathy and
secondary renal damage due to hypertension were ex￾cluded [12,13]. All patients were recommended to
follow-up in the out-patient center every 3 months;
however, information was obtained for only 264 subjects
to June 2008. The base characteristics of these 264 sub￾jects were similar to those of the 757 subjects that were
initially included (Additional file 1: Table S1).
Definitions
BMI was calculated as weight (kg) divided by height2 (m2
).
Based on the cut-off points in Chinese adults [8], BMI was
classified as follows: obese, ≥28.0 kg/m2
; overweight, 25.0-
27.9 kg/m2
; lean <25.0 kg/m2
. The proteinuria per 24 -
hours and creatinine clearance rate (Ccr) were evaluated
by 24-hour urine collection at the time of biopsy, and Ccr
were calculated with the standard formula: urine creatin￾ine (mg/dL) × urine volume (mL/min)/serum creatinine
(mg/dL) and adjusted for body surface [14]. Other defini￾tions were used: 1) nephrotic range proteinuria, 24-hour
urine protein excretion ≥3.5 g; 2) hypoalbuminemia,
serum albumin levels ≤3.5 g/L; 3) K/DOQ1 stage I,
Ccr >90 mL/min/1.73 m2
; and 3) renal insufficiency,
Ccr <60 mL/min/1.73 m2
. Insulin resistance was assessed
using the Homeostasis Model Assessment of Insulin Re￾sistance formula: fasting serum insulin (μU/mL) × fasting
plasma glucose (mmol/L)/22.5 [15]. Anemia was defined
as hemoglobin < 12 and < 11 g/dL in men and women,
respectively.
Periodic acid-Schiff-stained paraffin-embedded sections
at × 400 magnification were used to estimate pathologic
lesions [16,17]. The percentages of globally sclerotic glom￾eruli and Kimmelstiel-Wilson (K-W) nodules were recorded
from 50 glomerular sections for each patient. A semi￾quantitative assessment of renal damage was performed
according to mesangial proliferation, interstitial fibrosis,
tubular atrophy and arteriolar hyalinosis [18].
The progression of renal injury was defined by the de￾velopment of ESRD and increased proteinuria. The pri￾mary endpoint, ESRD, was defined as the requirement
for permanent renal replacement therapy or serum cre￾atinine exceeding 6.0 mg/dL for more than 1 month
without other causes of renal dysfunction. The second￾ary endpoint, increased proteinuria, was defined as a
50% increase from the baseline level of proteinuria.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS, version
11.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL). Quantitative variables were
expressed as mean ± SD and compared by one-way
ANOVA, followed with Least-Significant Difference
(LSD) tests between each pair of groups. In the absence
of a normal distribution, log-transformed data values
were used for analysis and the Mann–Whitney test U￾test was used when necessary. Qualitative variables were
described as sample size (number of cases) and percent￾age (%), which were analyzed by chi-square test or Fish￾er’s exact test. Cumulative incidence of ESRD or disease
progression was calculated using Kaplan-Meier survival
probabilities (1- survival probabilities). Adjusted relative
risks of mortality were calculated using Cox regression
analysis. Two-tailed P-values less than 0.05 were consid￾ered statistically significant.

Results
Obesity profile of DN patients in China
All 264 patients were diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and
renal biopsy-confirmed DN. Analysis of the baseline
characteristics are shown in Figure 1 and Table 1. The
mean age of patients with DN was 53.1 ± 9.06 years
(range 31–80). Of the DN patients, 58.3% were male.
The average BMI was 25.5 ± 3.39 kg/m2 (range 18.9–
36.6), and the frequency of BMI peaked at 24 kg/m2
(Figure 1A). Among these patients, 22.3% were obese,
while 53.8% were obese/overweight. The average pro￾teinuria was 3.09 ± 2.32 g/24 h (range 0.4–22.9),
(Figure 1B), and 37.4% had nephrotic range proteinuria.
Mean serum albumin was 34.5 ± 7.4 g/L, and 53.5% had
hypoalbuminemia. Renal Ccr greatly varied in patients
and the frequency of Ccr peaked around 50 mL/s/
1.73 m2 (Figure 1C). Renal insufficiency occurred in
32.3% of subjects, 129 (48.9%) patients remained classi￾fied as early stage (K/DOQI stage I), and no patients
suffered from ESRD. The mean serum creatinine was
2.02 ± 2.02 mg/dL.
Patients were divided into three groups on the basis of
BMI as follows: obese, ≥28.0 kg/m2 (n = 59); overweight,
25–30 kg/m2 (n = 83); and lean, 18–25 kg/m2 (n = 122).
The mean age and sex ratio among the three groups
were similar, as were fasting glucose, HbA1c, mean
blood pressure and previous therapy. At the time of diag￾nosis, the known duration of diabetes among patients
ranged from a few months to 28 years. Compared with
the obese patients, the lean patients suffered a longer dur￾ation of diabetes (P < 0.01), although the average history of
proteinuria was similar among the three groups.
Among the lean patients, the percentage of renal insuffi￾ciency was 42.6%, presenting Ccr less than 60 mL/s/

1.73 m2
, which was significantly higher than that in the
obese or overweight patients (P < 0.001, ANOVA). When
compared with obese patients, the lean patients with DN
showed higher levels of serum creatinine (P = 0.010), a
higher percentage of hypoalbuminemia (P = 0.007) and
anemia (P < 0.001), and greater mesangial expansion
(P < 0.001), tubular atrophy (P = 0.012) and incidence of
K-W nodules (P < 0.001). Obese patients had larger glom￾eruli than those with a lean phenotype (P = 0.031).
Obesity and improved renal survival in DN patients
The information for follow-up was available for only 264
patients, and the median follow-up time was 39.0 months
(range 0–87.0) (Figure 2). The median time of follow-up
was 39.0, 36.0 and 36.0 months for the lean, overweight
and obese groups, respectively. The levels of fasting glu￾cose fluctuated but were similar among the three groups
(Figure 2B). By the end of the study period, 74 cases
(28.8%) had developed ESRD.
Compared with obese patients, the lean patients had a
greater risk for developing ESRD (Figure 2). After 36 -
months of follow-up, the mean increment of serum cre￾atinine was 126% in the lean group, while this was 52.7%
and 33.5% in the overweight and obese groups, respect￾ively (P < 0.001, ANOVA). By the end of the study
period, 48 (39.4%) lean patients developed ESRD, and
the relative risk of developing ESRD for the lean pheno￾type was 1.812 (95% CI 1.004–3.268; P = 0.048, Figure 2C).
On the other hand, the mean BMI decreased among
patients in the overweight or obese groups (Figure 2D),
while no obvious change in BMI was detected in the lean
group (data not shown). Regarding the obese patients, the
reduction in BMI reached 1.30 kg/m2 and 2.28 kg/m2 after
36 and 63 months follow-up, respectively. The percent￾age of obesity in DN patients decreased from 22.3% at
baseline to 19.3% at the end of the study period, while
the rate of the lean phenotype increased from 46.2%
to 58.3%.
Obesity and increased proteinuria at early stage DN
Using the classification of chronic kidney disease, 129 sub￾jects were classified as K/DOQI stage I and analyzed for
an association between obesity and increased proteinuria
at the early stage (Table 2). The demographic profile, in￾cluding age and sex ratio, was similar between the total
patient population studies and those at the early stage
(data not shown). The patients at the early stage were fur￾ther divided into three subgroups based on BMI: obese
(n = 32), overweight (n = 51) and lean (n = 46).
Among the patients at the early stage, the known dur￾ation of diabetes was similar among the three subgroups,
although this factor differed in the total patient population
studied and those with DN. The known duration of pro￾teinuria was similar among the three groups at the early
stage, as were the levels of fasting glucose, HbA1c and
mean blood pressure. At the early stage, greater renal
damage was observed in obese patients compared with
lean patients, with greater glomerular hyperfiltration and
a lower percentage of anemia (P = 0.027 and P = 0.007,
respectively).
Among the patients at the early stage, the median time
of follow-up was 30.0 months (Figure 3). The fasting
glucose levels were almost stable during follow-up
(Figure 3B). By the end of the study period, only 2
(1.55%) cases developed ESRD, while 30 (24.8%) patients
had increased proteinuria. The mean levels of protein￾uria increased in the obese patients, reaching 11.3% and
63.3% after 36 and 63 months, respectively (Figure 3A).
However, no obvious increase in proteinuria was
detected in the lean and overweight subgroups. The rela￾tive risk for increased proteinuria was high in the obese
patients, and 12 (37.5%) exhibited a 50% increase in
Figure 1 Histogram of weight mass index (A), proteinuria (B) and creatinine clearance rate (C) distribution among study subjects with

proteinuria compared with the baseline levels. Using the
lean group as a reference, obesity showed a significantly
higher risk for increased proteinuria (Hazard ratio 2.872
[95% CI 1.239–6.659], P = 0.014). Compared with the
total population of obese patients studied, the decrease
in mean BMI was relatively small in obese patients
at the early stage (P = 0.018) and was only 1.12 kg/m2
after 63 months of follow-up (Figure 3D). The over￾weight patients at the early stage did not show obvious
changes in BMI.
Discussion
With rapid nutrition and lifestyle transitions over the
past two decades, the global rate of obesity has been in￾creasing at an alarming rate, including in China [19].
The frequency of diabetes has risen in tandem, as obes￾ity is a component of risk factors for diabetes [20].
Today, China has the largest number of patients with
obesity and diabetes mellitus in the world. Furthermore,
increasing numbers of studies have investigated the
relationship between obesity and DN in this ethnic group.
This study shows for the first time that obesity and weight
loss are common in Chinese patients with biopsy￾confirmed DN.
Although all the patients were from a single unit, the
profile of patients is representative of the characteristics
of Chinese patients with renal disease, especially those
in Eastern China. In our institute, there was an abrupt
rise in the number of patients undergoing biopsy after
1985, reaching 500 cases per year in 1991, with a further
increase to over 1,000 cases per year after 1998 [9]. Re￾cently, the number of renal biopsies performed each year
has exceeded 2,000. The expanded pool of renal biopsies
from kidney disease patients makes the epidemiologic
investigation more reliable. However, the patients were
not regularly interviewed in our institute because of con￾cerns of economy and/or distance. The follow-up infor￾mation, therefore, was relatively limited. Among all 757
patients with DN, follow-up information was available
for only 264 subjects. The baseline characteristics were
similar between the 757 patients and 264 patients (data
not shown).
In Chinese patients with biopsy-confirmed DN, 22.3%
presented with obesity and 53.7% with overweight/obes￾ity. The prevalence of obesity was as high as 24.8% in
patients with early stage DN. Compared with the preva￾lence in the general Chinese population [21], obesity was
more common in the patients with DN. High prevalence
of obesity has been confirmed in other ethnic groups
[22]. The obese patients with DN in this study exhibited
weight loss with diabetes during follow-up. On average,
BMI decreased by 4.62% (2.28 kg/m2
) after 63-months
in obese patients, while only moderate decreases were
observed in patients at the early stage. This suggested

in fasting glucose; C, cumulative incidence (%) of end-stage renal disease: patients with obesity have improved renal survival

that weight loss was a predictive marker of poor or declin￾ing health for diabetic patients, which was consistent with
the findings of other studies [23]. Accordingly, the patients
with lean phenotype had a longer duration of diabetes
than those with obesity. Compared with obese patients,
lean patients exhibited more severe renal injury, including
higher percentage of renal insufficiency and a higher score
for tubular lesions. Taking the lean group as the reference,
obesity and overweight significantly decreased the risk for
ESRD. This confirmed that a proportion of lean patients
suffer from both DN development and weight loss before
renal biopsy, and indicates that weight loss is the major
characteristics of the natural course of DN and shows a
predictive effect on DN in China. Thus, the lean pheno￾type indicates disease progression. However, a protective
role for obesity in renal disease progression was not iden￾tified in this retrospective study.
On the other hand, weight control was generally
thought to decrease the risk for renal injury associated
with obesity and diabetes. Our previous study also
proved that weight loss decreased urinary protein by
51% after 24 months in subjects with obesity-related
glomerulopathy (ORG) [24]. Saiki et al. reported the
protective effect of weight loss using a formula diet on
renal function in obese patients with DN [25]. These re￾sults contrast with our findings. In fact, more studies
have suggested the “obesity paradox” in diabetes and
renal diseases [26]. In the present study, a lean pheno￾type and weight loss were associated with a “deterior￾ation phenomenon” and progression of renal injury
in DN patients in China. On the other hand, obesity
contributed to increased proteinuria at the early stage of
DN. Among patients at CKD stage I, obese patients
showed greater hyperfiltration than lean patients. Obes￾ity further increased the risk for increased proteinuria by
2.872 compared with the lean patients. Similar results
were found in the subjects with normal renal function
or at the early stage of disease. Thus, the present study
using one population of DN patients showed a varied ef￾fect of obesity and weight loss on the progression of DN.

Much evidence has shown that the different effect of
weight loss resulted from two different mechanisms of
weight loss: intentional and unintentional. In brief, diet
control and extra exercise leads to intentional weight
loss, mainly from the fat mass, thus improving insulin
resistance, inflammation, and subsequent renal injury.
However, with the progression of diabetes, high sugar
levels lead to dehydration, muscle breakdown and an un￾intentional weight loss, which predicted clinical deterior￾ation. Zoccali [27] suggested that maintenance of the
current weight was the best way to protect against DN.
Unfortunately, BMI was the only marker used to evalu￾ate obesity in the present study, and it was difficult to
classify the source of weight loss. As a retrospective
study, the different effect of weight loss on DN was sug￾gested by the “obesity paradox” with no direct evidence
in support of this phenomenon. Further studies, espe￾cially prospective cohort studies, are required to com￾pare the effect of intentional and unintentional weight
loss on DN, which might help to explain the “obesity
paradox” and “weight loss paradox” in China.
It should be pointed out that there are several additional
limitations associated with this retrospective study. Serum
creatinine levels were used in the present study to define
ESRD, although this is not a sufficient measure of the loss
of renal function, as it can be influenced by muscle mass,
nutritional status and gender. In our institute, patients are
usually diagnosed with ESRD, when serum creatinine
levels exceed 6 mg/dL for more than 1 month, and other
causes of renal disease are excluded. The value of “6 mg/
dL” was adopted as a “cut-off” based on the value com￾monly used in Chinese medical schools [28]. Although in￾sufficient, serum creatinine is a conveniently tested
measure in clinical practice, and was therefore used as a
marker of the loss of renal function.
Because of the limitations of this study in terms of
population number and follow-up information, the de￾velopment of ESRD does not reflect the progression of
renal injury in all patients with DN. According to the
different features of DN at different stages, two end￾points were used to assess the progression of DN in the
present study. The development of ESRD was used as
the first endpoint, and increased proteinuria was used as
the second endpoint only for those patients at the early
stage. It is well known that early stage patients exhibit
micro-albuminuria or moderate proteinuria, with normal
levels of serum creatinine [10]. The levels of albumin￾uria/proteinuria were shown to be associated with the
severity and out-come of renal injury. At a later stage,
most patients had gross proteinuria and increased serum
creatinine. High levels of serum creatinine are linked
with ESRD, while the levels of proteinuria fluctuate with
diet and other factors. Using diverse end-points, our
study shows that obesity is significantly associated with
increased proteinuria in early stage patients, and the lean
phenotype is linked with ESRD in all DN patients.

It should also be noted that a direct effect of obesity has
been shown on renal function contributing to proteinuria
and renal lesions [29]. Some obese patients probably suf￾fered from ORG prior to the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes
or DN. It is difficult to distinguish between these two dis￾eases based on natural history, or from histological fea￾tures. ORG is characterized by glomerulomegaly and focal
segmental glomerulosclerosis, which can also be observed
in DN. Patients with DN, especially obese subjects, might
present with ORG simultaneously. Previous ORG and/
simultaneous ORG partly added to the difference in pro￾gression of CKD between lean and overweight/obese
patients.
Conclusions
Overall, our study demonstrates that obesity is very com￾mon among DN patients undergoing renal biopsy in
China, which is associated with the most rapid increases
in both obesity and diabetes globally. Obese patients
showed a natural course of DN – heavy proteinuria ini￾tially, followed by weight loss. Obesity seemed to be asso￾ciated with increased proteinuria at the early stage, while
it was associated with a benefit in terms of improved renal
survival at the later stages. Weight loss was accompanied
by the progression of diabetic nephropathy with a
prolonged diabetic duration. Lean patients exhibited a
greater acceleration of disease toward ESRD than obese
patients. The present study further elucidates the mechan￾ism of progression of DN in China in relation to obesity
and warns of the concurrence of weight loss and the de￾velopment of diabetes. Regular evaluation of weight is im￾portant for the patients with DN, as well monitoring of
glucose levels, proteinuria and serum creatinine.
