1.0 INTRODUCTION
Ascites is a major complication of cirrhosis,1
occurring in 50% of patients over 10 years of
follow up.2 The development of ascites is an
important landmark in the natural history of
cirrhosis as it is associated with a 50% mortality
over two years,2–5 and signifies the need to
consider liver transplantation as a therapeutic
option.3 The majority (75%) of patients who
present with ascites have underlying cirrhosis,
with the remainder being due to malignancy
(10%), heart failure (3%), tuberculosis (2%),
pancreatitis (1%), and other rare causes.6 The
true prevalence and incidence of cirrhosis of the
liver and its complications in the UK are
unknown. Mortality from cirrhosis has increased
from 6 per 100 000 population in 1993 to 12.7 per
100 000 population in 2000.7 Approximately 4%
of the general population have abnormal liver
function or liver disease8 and approximately
10–20% of those with one of the three most
common chronic liver diseases (non-alcoholic
fatty liver disease, alcoholic liver disease, and
chronic hepatitis C) develop cirrhosis over a
period of 10–20 years. With a rising frequency of
alcoholic and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, a
huge increase in the burden of liver disease is
expected over the next few years8 with an
inevitable increase in the complications of
cirrhosis. There have been several changes in
the clinical management of cirrhotic ascites over
recent years, and the purpose of these guidelines
is to promote a consistent clinical practice
throughout the UK.
These guidelines are based on a comprehensive
literature search, including the results of rando￾mised control trials, systematic reviews, prospec￾tive retrospective studies and, in some instances,
evidence obtained from expert committee
reports. Where possible a judgement is made
on the quality of the information used to
generate the guidelines, and the specific recom￾mendations have been graded according to the
Oxford Centre for Evidence-based Medicine
Levels of Evidence (May 2001) (see appendices
1 and 2).9 These guidelines conform to the
international guidelines recently published by
the International Ascites Club10 and are intended
for use by physicians. We hope to revise these
guidelines in three years time.
2.0 DEFINITIONS
The terms used in this article have been defined
by the International Ascites Club.11
Uncomplicated ascites
Ascites that is not infected and which is not
associated with the development of the hepato￾renal syndrome. Ascites can be graded as follows:
N Grade 1 (mild). Ascites is only detectable by
ultrasound examination.
N Grade 2 (moderate). Ascites causing moderate
symmetrical distension of the abdomen.
N Grade 3 (large). Ascites causing marked
abdominal distension.
Refractory ascites
Ascites that cannot be mobilised or early
recurrence of which (that is, after therapeutic
paracentesis) cannot be satisfactorily prevented
by medical therapy. This includes two different
subgroups.
N Diuretic resistant ascites—ascites that is
refractory to dietary sodium restriction and
intensive diuretic treatment (spironolactone
400 mg/day and frusemide 160 mg/day for at
least one week, and a salt restricted diet of
less than 90 mmol/day (5.2 g of salt)/day).
N Diuretic intractable ascites—ascites that is
refractory to therapy due to the development
of diuretic induced complications that pre￾clude the use of an effective diuretic dosage.
3.0 PATHOGENESIS OF ASCITES
FORMATION
A detailed description of the pathogenesis of
ascites formation is beyond the scope of this
article but more detailed reviews are available.12–14
There are two key factors involved in the
pathogenesis of ascites formation—namely,
sodium and water retention, and portal (sinusoi￾dal) hypertension.
3.1 Role of portal hypertension
Portal hypertension increases the hydrostatic
pressure within the hepatic sinusoids and
favours transudation of fluid into the peritoneal
cavity. However, patients with presinusoidal
portal hypertension without cirrhosis rarely
develop ascites. Thus patients do not develop
ascites with isolated chronic extrahepatic portal
venous occlusion or non-cirrhotic causes of
portal hypertension such as congenital hepatic
fibrosis, except following an insult to liver
function such as gastrointestinal haemorrhage.
Conversely, acute hepatic vein thrombosis, caus￾ing postsinusoidal portal hypertension, is usually
associated with ascites. Portal hypertension
occurs as a consequence of structural changes
within the liver in cirrhosis and increased
splanchnic blood flow. Progressive collagen
deposition and formation of nodules alter the

normal vascular architecture of the liver and increase
resistance to portal flow. Sinusoids may become less
distensible with the formation of collagen within the space
of Disse. While this may give the impression of a static portal
system, recent studies have suggested that activated hepatic
stellate cells may dynamically regulate sinusoidal tone and
thus portal pressure.
Sinusoidal endothelial cells form an extremely porous
membrane which is almost completely permeable to macro￾molecules, including plasma proteins. In contrast, splanchnic
capillaries have a pore size 50–100 times less than that of
hepatic sinusoids. As a consequence, the trans-sinusoidal
oncotic pressure gradient in the liver is virtually zero while it
is 0.8–0.9 (80%–90% of maximum) in the splanchnic
circulation.12 Oncotic pressure gradients at such extreme
ends of the spectrum minimise any effect the changes in
plasma albumin concentration may have on transmicrovas￾cular fluid exchange. Therefore, the old concept that ascites is
formed secondary to decreased oncotic pressure is false, and
plasma albumin concentrations have little influence on the
rate of ascites formation. Portal hypertension is critical to the
development of ascites, and ascites rarely develops in patients
with a wedged hepatic venous portal gradient of
,12 mm Hg.15 Conversely, insertion of a side to side porta￾caval shunt to decrease portal pressure often causes resolu￾tion of ascites.
3.2 Pathophysiology of sodium and water retention
The classical explanations of sodium and water retention
occurring due to ‘‘underfill’’ or ‘‘overfill’’ are oversimplified.
Patients may exhibit features of either ‘‘underfill’’ or ‘‘over￾fill’’ depending on posture or severity of liver disease. One of
the key events thought to be critical in the pathogenesis of
renal dysfunction and sodium retention in cirrhosis is the
development of systemic vasodilatation, which causes a
decrease in effective arterial blood volume and a hyperdy￾namic circulation.16 The mechanism responsible for these
changes in vascular function is unknown but may involve
increased vascular synthesis of nitric oxide, prostacyclin, as
well as changes in plasma concentrations of glucagon,
substance P, or calcitonin gene related peptide.14
However, the haemodynamic changes vary with posture,
and studies by Bernardi et al have shown marked changes in
secretion of atrial natriuretic peptide with posture, as well as
changes in systemic haemodynamics.17 18 In addition, data
showing a decreased effective arterial volume in cirrhosis
have been disputed.19 It is agreed however that under supine
conditions and in experimental animals, there is an increase
in cardiac output and vasodilatation.
The development of renal vasoconstriction in cirrhosis is
partly a homeostatic response involving increased renal
sympathetic activity and activation of the renin-angiotensin
system to maintain blood pressure during systemic vasodil￾atation.20 Decreased renal blood flow decreases glomerular
filtration rate and thus the delivery and fractional excretion
of sodium. Cirrhosis is associated with enhanced reabsorp￾tion of sodium both at the proximal tubule and at the distal
tubule.20 Increased reabsorption of sodium in the distal
tubule is due to increased circulating concentrations of
aldosterone. However, some patients with ascites have
normal plasma concentrations of aldosterone,21 leading to
the suggestion that sodium reabsorption in the distal tubule
may be related to enhanced renal sensitivity to aldosterone or
to other undefined mechanisms.22
In compensated cirrhosis, sodium retention can occur in
the absence of vasodilatation and effective hypovolaemia.
Sinusoidal portal hypertension can reduce renal blood flow
even in the absence of haemodynamic changes in the
systemic circulation, suggesting the existence of a hepatorenal
reflex.23 24 Similarly, in addition to systemic vasodilation, the
severity of liver disease and portal pressure also contribute to
the abnormalities of sodium handling in cirrhosis.25
4.0 DIAGNOSIS
4.1 Initial investigations
The underlying cause of ascites is frequently obvious from the
history and physical examination. However, it is important to
exclude other causes of ascites. It should not be assumed that
the alcoholic patient has alcoholic liver disease. Therefore,
tests must be directed at diagnosing the cause of ascites. The
essential investigations on admission include a diagnostic
paracentesis with measurement of ascitic fluid albumin or
protein, ascitic fluid neutrophil count and culture, and ascitic
fluid amylase. Ascitic fluid cytology should be requested
when there is a clinical suspicion of underlying malignancy.
Other investigations should include abdominal ultrasound
scan to evaluate the appearance of the liver, pancreas, and
lymph nodes as well as the presence of splenomegaly, which
may signify portal hypertension. Blood tests should be taken
for measurement of urea and electrolytes, liver function tests,
prothrombin time, and full blood count.
4.2 Abdominal paracentesis
The commonest site for an ascitic tap is approximately 15 cm
lateral to the umbilicus, with care being taken to avoid an
enlarged liver or spleen, and is usually done in the left or the
right lower abdominal quadrant.12 The inferior and superior
epigastric arteries run just lateral to the umbilicus towards
the mid-inguinal point and should be avoided. For diagnostic
purposes, 10–20 ml of ascitic fluid should be withdrawn
(ideally using a syringe with a blue or green needle) for
inoculation of ascites into two blood culture bottles and an
EDTA tube, and the tests outlined below. Complications of
ascitic taps occur in up to 1% of patients (abdominal
haematomas) but are rarely serious or life threatening.26 27
More serious complications such as haemoperitoneum or
bowel perforation are rare (,1/1000 procedures).28
Paracentesis is not contraindicated in patients with an
abnormal coagulation profile. The majority of patients with
ascites due to cirrhosis have prolongation of the prothrombin
time and some degree of thrombocytopenia. There are no
data to support the use of fresh frozen plasma before
paracentesis although if thrombocytopenia is severe (,40
000) most clinicians would give pooled platelets to reduce the
risk of bleeding.
4.3 Ascitic fluid investigations
4.3.1 Ascitic fluid neutrophil count and culture
All patients should be screened for the development of
spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), which is present in
approximately 15% of patients with cirrhosis and ascites
admitted to hospital.29–31 An ascitic neutrophil count of
.250 cells/mm3 (0.256109
/l) is diagnostic of SBP in the
absence of a known perforated viscus or inflammation of
intrabdominal organs. The concentration of red blood cells in
cirrhotic ascites is usually ,1000 cells/mm3 and bloody
ascitic fluid (.50,000 cells/mm3
) occurs in about 2% of
cirrhotics.32 In approximately 30% of cirrhotics with bloody
ascites, there is an underlying hepatocellular carcinoma.33
Recommendation
N It is recommended that patients give informed consent
for a therapeutic or diagnostic paracentesis. (Level of
evidence: 5; recommendation: D.)

However, in 50% of patients with bloody ascites, no cause can
be found.33 Gram’s stain of ascitic fluid is not indicated, as it
is rarely helpful.34 The sensitivity of smear for mycobacteria is
very poor while fluid culture for mycobacteria has a
sensitivity of 50%.35 Several studies have shown that
inoculation of ascitic fluid into blood culture bottles will
identify an organism in approximately 72–90% of cases
whereas sending ascitic fluid in a sterile container to the
laboratory will only identify an organism in about 40% of
cases of SBP.34 36–39
4.3.2 Ascitic fluid protein and ascitic fluid amylase
Conventionally, the type of ascites is divided into exudates
and transudates, in which the ascitic protein concentration is
.25 g/l or ,25 g/l, respectively. The purpose of this subdivi￾sion is to help identify the cause of ascites. Thus ‘‘malignancy
classically causes an exudative ascites and cirrhosis causes a
transudate’’. However, there are many misconceptions in
clinical practice. For example, it is often presumed that
cardiac ascites is a transudate when this is rarely the case,
ascitic protein is .25 g/l in up to 30% of patients with
otherwise uncomplicated cirrhosis,32 40–43 and patients with
cirrhosis and tuberculous ascites may have a low ascitic
protein.44 The serum ascites-albumin gradient (SA-AG) is far
superior in categorising ascites with 97% accuracy
(table 1).42 45 46 It is calculated as:
SA-AG = serum albumin concentration 2 ascitic fluid
albumin concentration
As a high ascitic amylase is diagnostic of pancreatic
ascites,47–49 ascitic fluid amylase should be determined in
patients where there is clinical suspicion of pancreatic
disease.
4.3.3 Ascitic fluid cytology
Only 7% of ascitic fluid cytologies are positive50 yet cytological
examination is 60–90% accurate in the diagnosis of malig￾nant ascites, especially when several hundred millilitres of
fluid is tested and concentration techniques are used.12
Clinicians should liaise with their local cytology department
to discuss fluid requirements before paracentesis. But ascites
fluid cytology is not the investigation of choice for the
diagnosis of primary hepatocellular carcinoma.
5.0 TREATMENT
5.1 Bed rest
In patients with cirrhosis and ascites, assumption of upright
posture is associated with activation of the renin-angioten￾sin-aldosterone and sympathetic nervous system, a reduction
in glomerular filtration rate and sodium excretion, as well as
a decreased response to diuretics.14 51 These effects are even
more striking in association with moderate physical exer￾cise.52 53 These data strongly suggest that patients should be
treated with diuretics while on bed rest. However, there have
been no clinical studies to demonstrate increased efficacy of
diuresis with bed rest or decreased duration of hospitalisa￾tion. As bed rest may lead to muscle atrophy, and other
complications, as well as promoting extended stays in
hospital, it is not generally recommended for the manage￾ment of patients with uncomplicated ascites.
5.2 Dietary salt restriction
Dietary salt restriction alone can create a negative sodium
balance in 10% of patients.54 Sodium restriction has been
associated with lower diuretic requirement, faster resolution
of ascites, and shorter hospitalisation.55 56 In the past, dietary
salt was often restricted to 22 or 50 mmol/day. These diets
may lead to protein malnutrition and a similar outcome,57
and are no longer recommended. A typical UK diet contains
about 150 mmol of sodium per day, of which 15% is from
added salt and 70% is from manufactured food.58 59 Dietary
salt should be restricted to ,90 mmol/day (5.2 g) salt by
adopting a no-added salt diet and avoidance of pre-prepared
foodstuffs (for example, pies). Dieticians’ guidance and
information leaflets will assist in educating patient and
relatives regarding salt restriction. Certain drugs, especially
those in the effervescent tablet form, have high sodium
contents. Intravenous antibiotics generally contain 2.1–
3.6 mmol of sodium per gram with the exception of
ciprofloxacin which contains 30 mmol sodium in 200 ml
(400 mg) for intravenous infusion. Although in general it is
preferable to avoid infusion of fluids which contain salt in
patients with ascites, there are occasions, such as the
development of hepatorenal syndrome or renal impairment
with severe hyponatraemia, when it may be appropriate and
indicated to give volume expansion with a crystalloid or
colloid. For patients developing hepatorenal syndrome, the
International Ascites Club recommend infusion of normal
saline.
5.3 Role of water restriction
There have been no studies on the benefits or harm of water
restriction on the resolution of ascites. Most experts agree
that there is no role for water restriction in patients with
uncomplicated ascites. However, water restriction for
patients with ascites and hyponatraemia has become

standard clinical practice in many centres. However, there is
real controversy about the best management of these
patients, and at present we do not know the best approach.
Most hepatologists treat these patients with severe water
restriction. However, based on our understanding of the
pathogenesis of hyponatraemia, this treatment is probably
illogical and may exacerbate the severity of effective central
hypovolaemia that drives the non-osmotic secretion of
antidiuretic hormone (ADH). This may result in further
increases in circulating ADH, and a further decline of renal
function. Impaired free water clearance is observed in 25–
60% of patients with ascites due to cirrhosis,60 and many
develop spontaneous hyponatraemia.61 Therefore, some
hepatologists, including the authors, advocate further plasma
expansion to normalise and inhibit stimulation of ADH
release. Studies are needed to determine the best approach.62
There are data emerging that support the use of specific
vasopressin 2 receptor antagonists in the treatment of
dilutional hyponatraemia,63–65 but whether this improves
overall morbidity and mortality is not yet known. It is
important to avoid severe hyponatraemia in patients awaiting
liver transplantation as it may increase the risk of central
pontine myelinolysis during fluid resuscitation in surgery.
5.4 Management of hyponatraemia in patients on
diuretic therapy
5.4.1 Serum sodium >126 mmol/l
For patients with ascites who have a serum sodium
>126 mmol/l, there should be no water restriction, and
diuretics can be safely continued, providing that renal
function is not deteriorating or has not significantly
deteriorated during diuretic therapy.
5.4.2 Serum sodium (125 mmol/l
For patients with moderate hyponatraemia (serum sodium
121–125 mmol/l), opinion is divided on what is the next best
course of action. The international opinion,10 in which a
consensus of international experts was sought and reported,
is that diuretics should be continued. However, there are no
or few data to support the best course of action, and our
personal view is to adopt a more cautious approach. We
believe that diuretics should be stopped once serum sodium
is (125 mmol/l and the patient observed. All experts in the
field recommend stopping diuretics if serum sodium is
(120 mmol/l. If there is a significant increase in serum
creatinine or serum creatinine is .150 mmol/l, we would
recommend volume expansion. Gelofusine, haemaccel, and
4.5% albumin solutions contain sodium concentrations
equivalent to normal saline (154 mmol/l). This will worsen
their salt retention but we take the view that it is better to
have ascites with normal renal function than to develop
potentially irreversible renal failure. Water restriction should
be reserved for those who are clinically euvolaemic with
severe hyponatraemia in which free water clearance is
decreased, and who are not currently taking diuretics, and
in whom serum creatinine is normal.
5.5 Diuretics
Diuretics have been the mainstay of treatment of ascites since
the 1940s when they first became available. Many diuretic
agents have been evaluated over the years but in clinical
practice in the UK this has been mainly confined to
spironolactone, amiloride, frusemide, and bumetanide.
These are discussed below.
5.5.1 Spironolactone
Spironolactone is an aldosterone antagonist, acting mainly
on the distal tubules to increase natriuresis and conserve
potassium. Spironolactone is the drug of choice in the initial
treatment of ascites due to cirrhosis.66 The initial daily dose of
100 mg may have to be progressively increased up to 400 mg
to achieve adequate natriuresis. There is a lag of 3–5 days
between the beginning of spironolactone treatment and the
onset of the natriuretic effect.67 Controlled studies have found
that spironolactone achieves a better natriuresis and diuresis
than a ‘‘loop diuretic’’ such as frusemide.68–71 Most frequent
side effects of spironolactone in cirrhotics are those related to
its antiandrogenic activity, such as decreased libido, impo￾tence, and gynaecomastia in men and menstrual irregularity
in women (although most women with ascites do not
menstruate anyway). Gynaecomastia can be significantly
reduced when the hydrophilic derivative potassium canreno￾ate is used,72 but this is not readily available in the UK.
Tamoxifen at a dose 20 mg twice a day has been shown to be
useful in the management of gynaecomastia.73
Hyperkalaemia is a significant complication that frequently
limits the use of spironolactone in the treatment of ascites.74
5.5.2 Frusemide
Frusemide is a loop diuretic which causes marked natriuresis
and diuresis in normal subjects. It is generally used as an
adjunct to spironolactone treatment because of its low
efficacy when used alone in cirrhosis.71 The initial dose of
frusemide is 40 mg/day and it is generally increased every 2–
3 days up to a dose not exceeding 160 mg/day. High doses of
frusemide are associated with severe electrolyte disturbance
and metabolic alkalosis, and should be used cautiously.
Simultaneous administration of frusemide and spironolac￾tone increases the natriuretic effect.12 28
5.5.3 Other diuretics
Amiloride acts on the distal tubule and induces diuresis in
80% of patients at doses of 15–30 mg/day.75 It is less effective
compared with spironolactone or potassium canrenoate.71 72
Bumetanide is similar to frusemide in its action and
efficacy.76
Generally, a ‘‘stepped care’’ approach is used in the
management of ascites starting with modest dietary salt
restriction, together with an increasing dose of spironolac￾tone. Frusemide is only added when 400 mg of spironolac￾tone alone has proved ineffective.77–79 In patients with severe
oedema there is no need to slow down the rate of daily
weight loss.28 Once the oedema has resolved but ascites
persists, then the rate of weight loss should not exceed
Recommendations
N Serum sodium 126–135 mmol/l, normal serum crea￾tinine. Continue diuretic therapy but observe serum
electrolytes. Do not water restrict.
N Serum sodium 121–125 mmol/l, normal serum crea￾tinine. International opinion is to continue diuretic
therapy, our opinion is to stop diuretic therapy or
adopt a more cautious approach.
N Serum sodium 121–125 mmol/l, serum creatinine
elevated (.150 mmol/l or .120 mmol/l and rising).
Stop diuretics and give volume expansion.
N Serum sodium (120 mmol/l, stop diuretics.
Management of these patients is difficult and con￾troversial. We believe that most patients should
undergo volume expansion with colloid (haemaccel,
gelofusine, or voluven) or saline. However, avoid
increasing serum sodium by .12 mmol/l per
24 hours.

,0.5 kg/day.80 Over diuresis is associated with intravascular
volume depletion (25%) leading to renal impairment, hepatic
encephalopathy (26%), and hyponatraemia (28%).81
Approximately 10% of patients with cirrhosis and ascites
have refractory ascites.71 82 In patients who fail to respond to
treatment, a careful dietary and drug history should be
obtained. It is important to ensure that they are not consuming
drugs that are rich in sodium, or drugs that inhibit salt and
water excretion such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs.83 84 Compliance with dietary sodium restriction should
be monitored by measurement of urinary sodium excretion. If
urinary sodium exceeds the recommended sodium intake, and
the patient fails to respond to treatment, then it can be assumed
that the patient is non-compliant.85
5.6 Therapeutic paracentesis
Patients with large or refractory ascites are usually initially
managed by repeated large volume paracentesis. Several
controlled clinical studies have demonstrated that large
volume paracentesis with colloid replacement is rapid, safe,
and effective.81 86–88 The first study demonstrated that serial
large volume paracentesis (4–6 l/day) with albumin infusion
(8 g/litre of ascites removed) was more effective and was
associated with fewer complications and shorter duration of
hospitalisation compared with diuretic therapy.86 This study
was followed by other studies evaluating the efficacy, safety,
speed of paracentesis, haemodynamic changes following
paracentesis, and need for colloid replacement therapy.
Total paracentesis is generally safer than repeated paracent￾esis,89 if volume expansion is administered post-paracentesis.
Failure to give volume expansion can lead to post-paracent￾esis circulatory dysfunction with impairment of renal
function and electrolyte disturbances.90–93
Following paracentesis, ascites recurs in the majority
(93%) if diuretic therapy is not reinstituted, but recurs in
only 18% of patients treated with spironolactone.94
Reintroduction of diuretics after paracentesis (usually within
1–2 days) does not appear to increase the risk of post￾paracentesis circulatory dysfunction.
5.6.1 Haemodynamic changes following
paracentesis
Total paracentesis is associated with significant haemody￾namic effects.91 It has been assumed wrongly that total
paracentesis of large volumes of ascites (.10 litre) leads to
circulatory collapse. Large volume paracentesis (average
.10 litre over 2–4 hours) causes a marked reduction in
intra-abdominal and inferior vena cava pressure, leading to a
decrease in right atrial pressure and an increase in cardiac
output. These haemodynamic changes are maximal at three
hours. Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure decreases at six
hours and continues to fall further in the absence of colloid
replacement. On average, blood pressure decreases by
,8 mm Hg.91 The severity of post-paracentesis circulatory
dysfunction correlates inversely with patient survival.95 There
are anecdotal reports of some patients with advanced liver
disease developing quite severe hypotension post-paracentesis,
but this rarely occurs.
5.6.2 Plasma expansion post paracentesis
One study, which evaluated the haemodynamic and neuro￾humoral responses in 12 patients following a single ,5 litre
total paracentesis concluded that it was safe to omit the use
of albumin in these patients.96 However, many experts in the
field have reservations on basing such a recommendation on
a single small unrandomised study. Thus the International
Ascites Club recommends that a synthetic plasma expander is
used if less than 5 litre is removed, and this recommendation
was based on consensus rather than fact.10 Plasma volume
expansion should always be used whenever .5 litre of
ascites are removed. Serial paracentesis with and without
albumin replacement have been evaluated in patients with
tense ascites.90 There was a significantly higher rate of renal
impairment, significant fall in serum sodium levels, and a
marked activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone
system in those patients not treated with albumin.90
There is still some debate about whether volume expansion
should be carried out using albumin or artificial plasma
expanders. Analysis of individual, but relatively small and
underpowered randomised controlled trials comparing dex￾tran 70 or haemaccel/gelofusine with albumin suggest that
these plasma expanders are clinically effective in the
prevention of hyponatraemia and renal impairment.97–99
However, the use of artificial plasma expanders is associated
with a significantly greater activation of renin-angiotensin￾aldosterone.97 These data suggest that if enough patients were
studied, that albumin would prove to be clinically superior to
haemaccel or gelofusine or dextrans. Indeed, analysis of data
from all published studies also suggests that albumin is more
effective in the prevention of hyponatraemia (8% of 482
patients) compared with 17% of 344 patients for other
plasma expanders.100 A recent study by Moreau et al suggested
that administration of albumin post-paracentesis decreases
the number of liver related complications, and that the
median hospital cost for a 30 day period was significantly
lower (less than 50%) than the cost of those treated with
artificial plasma expanders.101 Until further studies are
undertaken to compare the efficacy of albumin versus artificial
plasma expanders, we would recommend that albumin remains
the plasma expander of choice when large volume (.5 litre)
paracentesis is undertaken. Albumin (as 20% or 25% solution)
should be infused after paracentesis of .5 litre is completed at a
dose of 8 g albumin/litre of ascites removed.
5.7 Procedure
Paracentesis should be carried out under strict sterile condi￾tions. The cannula should have multiple side perforations,
otherwise the end becomes blocked by bowel wall. The needle is
usually inserted into the left (preferably) or right lower
abdominal quadrant using the ‘‘Z’’ track (skin is penetrated
perpendicularly). The needle is advanced obliquely in sub￾cutaneous tissue and then the peritoneal cavity is punctured,
with the needle pointing perpendicular to the abdominal wall.
This will ensure that the needle track has the puncture site on
the skin and the peritoneum that do not overlie each other. All
ascitic fluid should be drained to dryness in a single session as
rapidly as possible over 1–4 hours, assisted by gentle mobilisa￾tion of the cannula or turning the patient on to their side if
necessary. In the author’s opinion, the drain should not be left in
overnight. After paracentesis, the patient should lie on the
opposite side for two hours if there is leakage of any remaining
ascitic fluid, and/or a suture (ideally purse string) inserted
around the site of drainage. These steps help to minimise the
risk of ascitic fluid leakage.
Recommendations
N Firstline treatment of ascites should be spironolactone
alone, increasing from 100 mg/day to a dose of
400 mg/day.
N If this fails to resolve ascites, frusemide should be
added in a dose of up to 160 mg/day, but this should
be done with careful biochemical and clinical monitor￾ing.

5.8 Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt
(TIPS)
As elevated portal pressure is one of the main factors
contributing to the pathogenesis of ascites, it is not surprising
that TIPS is a highly effective treatment for refractory ascites.
It functions as a side to side portocaval shunt that is placed
under local anaesthesia and intravenous sedation, and has
largely replaced the use of surgically placed portocaval or
mesocaval shunts. Numerous uncontrolled studies have been
published assessing the effectiveness of TIPS in patients with
refractory ascites.102–105 In most studies technical success was
achieved in 93–100% of cases,103 106–108 with control of ascites
achieved in 27–92%103 108 109 and complete resolution in up to
75% of cases.103 TIPS results in a secondary decrease in the
activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, and
increases sodium excretion.110
Prospective randomised trials have shown TIPS to be more
effective in controlling ascites compared with large volume
paracentesis.111–113 However, there is no consensus regarding
the impact of TIPS on transplant free survival in patients with
refractory ascites. In one study TIPS had no effect on
survival112 while others have reported both reduced111 as well
as improved survival113 compared with therapeutic paracent￾esis. Moreover, TIPS also improves the overall nutritional well
being of patients, but whether this is simply secondary to
control of ascites and improved eating is not clear.110 114 115
Hepatic encephalopathy after TIPS insertion occurs in
approximately 25% of patients, and the risk is higher in
those over the age of 60 years.116 TIPS is associated with less
favourable outcome in advanced Child-Pugh class C
patients.111 TIPS increases the cardiac preload, and hence it
may precipitate heart failure in those with pre-existing heart
disease.117 TIPS insertion should be considered as a treatment
option for patients who require frequent paracentesis
(generally .3 a month). TIPS has also been shown to resolve
hepatic hydrothorax in 60–70% of patients.118–120
Model for end stage liver disease score, which was
originally developed to predict survival following a TIPS
procedure,121 has continued to evolve into a model that
predicts prognosis in cirrhosis.122 According to the initial TIPS
model, a risk score is calculated as
R = 0.9576loge (creatinine mg/dl) + 0.3786loge (bilirubin
mg/dl) + 1.1206loge (international normalised ratio) +
0.6436(cause of cirrhosis)
where cause of cirrhosis is coded as 0 for alcoholic or
cholestatic liver diseases and 1 for other causes. Please note
that old units are used for both creatinine and bilirubin.
Patients with a risk score R.1.8 have a median survival of
three months after elective TIPS and are considered
unsuitable for the procedure unless it is being performed as
a bridge to liver transplantation.121 Patients with a risk score
R = 1.5 have a median survival of six months and those with
R = 1.3 have a median survival of 12 months.
6.0 PROGNOSIS
The development of ascites is associated with a mortality of
50% within two years of diagnosis.2–5 Once ascites becomes
refractory to medical therapy, 50% die within six months.123
Despite improving fluid management and patient quality of
life while awaiting liver transplantation, treatments such as
therapeutic paracentesis and TIPS do not improve long term
survival without transplantation for most patients.103 124 125
Therefore, when any patient with cirrhosis develops ascites,
suitability for liver transplantation should be considered.
Attention should be given to renal function in patients with
ascites as pre-transplant renal dysfunction leads to greater
morbidity and delayed recovery following liver transplanta￾tion and is associated with a prolonged stay in the intensive
care unit and hospital.126–128
7.0 SPONTANEOUS BACTERIAL PERITONITIS
Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is the development of
a monomicrobial infection of ascites in the absence of a
contiguous source of infection. SBP is a frequent and serious
complication of cirrhotic patients with ascites. The prevalence
of SBP in cirrhotic hospitalised patients with ascites ranges
between 10% and 30%.29–31 When first described, its mortality
exceeded 90% but inhospital mortality has been reduced to
approximately 20% with early diagnosis and prompt treat￾ment.85
7.1 Diagnosis
Patients with SBP are frequently asymptomatic.129 130
However, a significant proportion have some symptoms such
as fever, mild abdominal pain, vomiting, or confusion.
Diagnosis should also be suspected in those who present
with hepatic encephalopathy, impairment of renal function,
or peripheral leucocytosis without any obvious precipitating
factor. A diagnostic paracentesis is mandatory in all patients
with cirrhosis requiring hospital admission.31
7.1.1 Ascitic fluid analysis
The diagnosis of SBP is confirmed when ascitic neutrophil
count is .250 cells/mm3 (0.256109
/l) in the absence of an
intra-abdominal and surgically treatable source of sepsis. A
cutoff of 250 neutrophils/mm3 has the greatest sensitivity
although a cutoff of 500 neutrophils/mm3 has greater
Recommendations
N Therapeutic paracentesis is the firstline treatment for
patients with large or refractory ascites. (Level of
evidence: 1a; recommendation: A.)
N Paracentesis of ,5 litre of uncomplicated ascites
should be followed by plasma expansion with a
synthetic plasma expander and does not require
volume expansion with albumin (Level of evidence:
2b; recommendation: B.)
N Large volume paracentesis should be performed in a
single session with volume expansion being given once
paracentesis is complete, preferably using 8 g albu￾min/litre of ascites removed (that is, ,100 ml of 20%
albumin/3 l ascites). (Level of evidence: 1b; recom￾mendation: A.)
Recommendation
N TIPS can be used for the treatment of refractory ascites
requiring frequent therapeutic paracentesis or hepatic
hydrothorax with appropriate assessment of risk
benefit ratio. (Level of evidence: 1b; recommendation:

specificity.131–134 In patients with haemorrhagic ascites with a
fluid red blood cell count of .10 000/mm3 (due to
concomitant malignancy or traumatic tap), subtraction of
one neutrophil per 250 RBC should be made to adjust for the
presence of blood in ascites.31 Historically, neutrophil counts
have been carried out by oncall microbiologists, as coulter
counter determinations of neutrophil counts were inaccurate
at the relatively low but pathological levels of neutrocytosis in
ascitic fluid (for example, polymorphonuclear cell (PMN)
count of 500 cells/mm3
). However, one recent study found
excellent correlation between these two techniques, even at
low counts, suggesting that automated counting may replace
manual counts.135 Gram’s stain of a smear of sediments
obtained after centrifugation of ascites fluid is rarely helpful
and should not be routinely requested.34
7.1.2 Ascitic fluid culture
This has been discussed before under ascitic fluid investiga￾tions (see above). Patients with ‘‘culture negative neutrocytic
ascites’’ (PMN count .250 cells/mm3 (0.256109
/l)) have a
similar clinical presentation to those with culture positive
SBP.136 137 As both groups of patients are associated with
significant morbidity and mortality,136 137 they should be
treated in a similar fashion. Some patients have ‘‘mono￾microbial bacterascites’’ in which cultures are positive but
there is normal ascitic neutrophil count.138 Such infections are
thought to occur relatively commonly, and the majority are
eradicated by the body’s natural defence mechanisms (for
example, opsonic and complement mediated bactericidal
activity).138 139 When a positive culture is obtained, a further
ascitic tap with a neutrophil count should be obtained. If the
neutrophil is normal and patient is asymptomatic, then
ignore the positive culture, but re-culture.138–140 If the
neutrophil count is .250 cells/mm3
, then treat as per SBP.
7.2 Treatment
7.2.1 Antibiotics
The commonest organisms isolated in patients with SBP
include Escherichia coli, gram positive cocci (mainly strepto￾coccus species) and enterococci. These organisms account for
approximately 70% of all cases of SBP.85 141 Cefotaxime has
been the most extensively investigated in patients with SBP
because it covers 95% of the flora isolated from ascitic fluid
and achieves high ascitic fluid concentrations during
therapy.28 142 Five days of treatment with cefotaxime is as
effective as 10 day therapy,143 and low dose (2 g twice daily)
is similar in efficacy to the higher doses (2 g four times
daily).144 Other cephalosporins, such as ceftriaxone and
ceftazidime as well as co-amoxiclav (amoxicillin plus
clavulanic acid), have been shown to be as effective as
cefotaxime in resolving SBP.31 145 In patients who are ‘‘well’’
(asymptomatic), with bowel sounds, SBP can be treated with
oral antibiotics.27 Under these circumstances either oral
ciprofloxacin (750 mg twice daily) or oral co-amoxiclav
(1000/200 mg amoxicillin/clavulanic acid three times daily),
subject to renal function, is logical.
Resolution of infection in SBP is associated with an
improvement in symptoms and signs. However, for those
patients who do not improve, treatment failure should be
recognised early. A reduction in ascitic fluid neutrophil count
of less than 25% of the pretreatment value after two days of
antibiotic treatment suggests failure to respond to therapy.31
This should raise the suspicion of ‘‘secondary peritonitis’’
(secondary to perforation or inflammation of intra-abdom￾inal organs) and indicate further evaluation or modification
of antibiotic treatment according to in vitro sensitivity or on
an empiric basis. The presence of multiple organisms in
ascitic fluid is strongly suggestive of perforated bowel, and
needs further urgent investigation.31 Although algorithms,
including estimation of ascetic fluid protein, glucose, lactate
dehydrogenase, carcinoembryonic antigen, and alkaline
phosphatase levels have been proposed to distinguish
‘‘secondary peritonitis’’ from SBP,146 147 erect chest x ray and
abdominal computed tomography scan are the most useful in
practice.
7.2.2 Albumin infusion in SBP
Development of renal impairment occurs in 30% of patients
with SBP and is one of the strongest predictors of mortality in
SBP.146 A recent study suggests that cefotaxime plus albumin
improves survival and decreases the incidence of renal
impairment to 10%.149 This study has since been criticised
as the control group were not given an equivalent amount of
fluid as crystalloid. A further study has demonstrated that
treatment with albumin is associated with significant
improvement in circulatory function and lower frequency of
endothelial dysfunction compared with equivalent doses of
hydroxyethyl starch.150 But the latter study was not powered
to compare clinical outcomes such as renal failure and
mortality. We believe that further studies are required before
making any formal recommendations about the use of
albumin in SBP. However, if patients have an increased
serum creatinine or a rising serum creatinine, we would
support infusing 1.5 g albumin/kg in the first six hours,
followed by 1 g/kg on day 3, which is the regimen adopted by
the Barcelona group in their study on the use of albumin in
SBP.149
7.2.3 Total paracentesis for SBP
There are no data on the role of total paracentesis in the
management of SBP.
Recommendations
N A diagnostic paracentesis should be performed in all
cirrhotic patients with ascites on hospital admission.
(Level of evidence 1a; recommendation A.)
N A diagnostic paracentesis should be performed in all
cirrhotic patients with ascites in those who have signs
and symptoms of peritoneal infection, including the
development of encephalopathy, renal impairment, or
peripheral leucocytosis without a precipitating factor.
(Level of evidence: 2b; recommendation: C.)
N Ascitic fluid should be inoculated into blood culture
bottles at the bedside. (Level of evidence: 2a;
recommendation: B.)
Recommendations
N In patients with an ascitic fluid neutrophil count of
.250 cells/mm3
, empiric antibiotic therapy should be
started. (Level of evidence: 1b; recommendation: A.)
N Third generation cephalosporins such as cefotaxime
have been most extensively studied in the treatment of
SBP and have been shown to be effective. (Level of
evidence: 1a; recommendation: A.)
N Patients with SBP and signs of developing renal
impairment should be given albumin at 1.5 g albu￾min/kg in the first six hours followed by 1 g/kg on day
3. (Level of evidence: 2b; recommendation: B.)

7.3 Prophylaxis
For patients who have never had SBP and in whom ascitic
fluid protein concentration is low (,10 g/l), there is no
consensus among experts regarding primary prophylaxis.31 In
patients who survive an episode of SBP, the cumulative
recurrence rate at one year is approximately 70%.85
Probability of survival at one year after an episode of SBP is
30–50% and falls to 25–30% at two years.151 152 Therefore,
patients recovering from an episode of SBP should always be
considered as a potential candidate for liver transplantation.
In patients who had one episode of SBP, oral norfloxacin
(400 mg/day) reduces the probability of recurrence of SBP
from 68% to 20% and the probability of SBP due to gram
negative bacilli from 60% to 3%.153 However, studies of
antibiotic prophylaxis using norfloxacin or ciprofloxacin in
patients with low ascites fluid protein concentration (,15 g/
l) have included a heterogeneous group of patients with and
without previous episodes of SBP.154 155 In the UK many
centres use once daily ciprofloxacin as prophylaxis against
SBP, although many also use norfloxacin. One study reported
that patients with cirrhosis on long term quinolone prophy￾laxis developed more gram positive bacterial infections
(79%), including methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus,
compared with predominantly gram negative infections
(67%) in those who were not on prophylaxis.156
8.0 CONCLUSIONS
The development of ascites is an important landmark in the
natural history of cirrhosis. Adequate management of ascites
is important, not only because it improves quality of life in
patients with cirrhosis, but also prevents serious complication
such as SBP. However, treatment of ascites does not
significantly improve survival. Therefore, development of
ascites should be considered as an indication for transplanta￾tion. Liver transplantation is the ultimate treatment of ascites
and its complications.
Recommendations
N Patients recovering from one episode of SBP should
receive prophylaxis with continuous oral norfloxacin
400 mg/day (or ciprofloxacin at 500 mg once daily).
(Level of evidence: 1b; recommendation: B.)
N All patients with SBP should be considered for referral
for liver transplantation. (Level of evidence: 1c;
recommendation: B.)
Summary of recommendations: management of
ascites in cirrhosis
Diagnosis
N It is recommended that patients give informed consent
for a therapeutic or diagnostic paracentesis.
N The initial ascitic fluid analysis should include serum
ascites-albumin gradient in preference to ascitic
protein.
N Ascitic amylase should be measured when there is
clinical suspicion of pancreatic disease.
N Ascitic fluid should be inoculated into blood culture
bottles at the bedside and examined by microscopy for
a neutrophil count.
Treatment
N Bed rest is not recommended for the treatment of
ascites.
N Dietary salt should be restricted to a no added salt diet
of 90 mmol salt/day (5.2 g salt/day).
Hyponatraemia
N Serum sodium 126–135 mmol/l, normal serum crea￾tinine. Continue diuretic therapy, but observe serum
electrolytes. Do not water restrict.
N Serum sodium 121–125 mmol/l, normal serum crea￾tinine. International opinion is to continue diuretic
therapy, our opinion is to stop diuretic therapy or
adopt a more cautious approach.
N Serum sodium 121–125 mmol/l, serum creatinine
elevated (.150 mmol/l or .120 mmol/l and rising).
Stop diuretics and give volume expansion.
N Serum sodium (120 mmol/l, stop diuretics. The
management of these patients is difficult and con￾troversial. We believe that most patients should
undergo volume expansion with colloid (haemaccel,
gelofusine, or voluven) or saline. However, avoid
increasing serum sodium by .12 mmol/l per
24 hours.
Diuretics
N Firstline treatment of ascites should be spironolactone
alone, increasing from 100 mg/day to a dose of
400 mg/day.
N If this fails to resolve ascites, frusemide should be
added in a dose of up to 160 mg/day but this should
be done with careful biochemical and clinical monitor￾ing.
Therapeutic paracentesis
N Therapeutic paracentesis is the firstline treatment for
patients with large or refractory ascites.
N Paracentesis of ,5 litre of uncomplicated ascites
should be followed by plasma expansion with a
synthetic plasma expander (150–200 ml of gelofusine
or haemaccel), and does not require volume expansion
with albumin.
N Large volume paracentesis should be performed in a
single session with volume expansion being given once
paracentesis is complete, preferably using 8 g albu￾min/l of ascites removed (that is, ,100 ml of 20%
albumin/3 l ascites).
TIPS procedure
N TIPS could be used for the treatment of refractory
ascites requiring frequent therapeutic paracentesis or
hepatic hydrothorax with appropriate assessment of
risk benefit ratio.
Liver transplantation
N Liver transplantation should be considered in patients
with cirrhotic ascites.
N All patients with SBP should be considered for referral
for liver transplantation.

Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP)
Diagnosis
N A diagnostic paracentesis should be performed in all
cirrhotic patients with ascites on hospital admission.
N A diagnostic paracentesis should be performed in all
cirrhotic patients with ascites in those who have signs
and symptoms of peritoneal infection including the
development of encephalopathy, renal impairment, or
peripheral leucocytosis without a precipitating factor.
N Ascitic fluid should be inoculated into blood culture
bottles at the bedside.
Treatment
N In patients with ascitic fluid neutrophil count of
.250 cells/mm3
, empiric antibiotic therapy should
be started.
N Third generation cephalosporins such as cefotaxime
have been most extensively studied in the treatment of
SBP and have been shown to be effective.
N Patients with SBP and signs of developing renal
impairment should be given albumin at 1.5 g albu￾min/kg in the first six hours followed by 1 g/kg on day
3.
Prophylaxis
N Patients recovering from one episode of SBP should
receive prophylaxis with continuous oral norfloxacin
400 mg/day (or ciprofloxacin at 500 mg once daily).

*Homogeneity means a systematic review that is free from worrisome variations (heterogeneity) in the results between individual studies.
Clinical decision rules are algorithms or scoring systems leading to a diagnostic category or prognostic estimation.
`All patients died before the therapy became available, but some survive now on it, or some died before therapy became available, but none now die on it.
Validating studies test the quality of a diagnostic test, based on prior evidence. An exploratory study collects information and (for example, using a regression
analysis) identifies which factors are significant
1Good, better, bad, and worse refer to the comparison between treatments in terms of their clinical benefit and risks.
**Poor quality cohort study is one that failed to define comparison groups and/or failed to measure exposures and outcomes in the same (preferably blinded)
objective way in both exposed and non-exposed individuals, and/or failed to identify and control for confounders and/or to complete long follow up. Poor quality
case control study is one that failed to define comparison groups and/or failed to measure exposures and outcomes in the same (preferably blinded) objective way
in both cases and controls, and/or failed to identify and control for confounders.
Poor quality prognostic cohort study is one with biased sampling in favour of patients who already had the target outcome, or outcomes were measured in
,80%, or outcomes were determined in an unblended non-objective way, or there was no correction for the confounders.
``An ‘‘absolute SpPin’’ is a diagnostic finding whose specificity is so high that a positive result confirms the diagnosis. ‘‘Absolute SnNout’’ is a diagnostic finding
whose sensitivity is so high that negative results rule out the diagnosis.
Split sample validation is achieved by collecting all the information in a single tranche and then dividing this into ‘‘derivation’’ and ‘‘validation’’ samples.
11Good follow up is .80%, with adequate time for alternative diagnosis to emerge (for example, 1–8 months acute, 1–5 years chronic).
***Better value treatments are clearly as good, but cheaper or better at the same or reduced cost. Worse value treatments are as good and more expensive, or
worse and equally/more expensive
