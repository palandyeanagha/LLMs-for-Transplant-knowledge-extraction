ABSTRACT
The diagnosis of Marfan syndrome (MFS) relies on
defined clinical criteria (Ghent nosology), outlined by
international expert opinion to facilitate accurate
recognition of this genetic aneurysm syndrome and to
improve patient management and counselling. These
Ghent criteria, comprising a set of major and minor
manifestations in different body systems, have proven to
work well since with improving molecular techniques,
confirmation of the diagnosis is possible in over 95% of
patients. However, concerns with the current nosology
are that some of the diagnostic criteria have not been
sufficiently validated, are not applicable in children or
necessitate expensive and specialised investigations.
The recognition of variable clinical expression and the
recently extended differential diagnosis further
confound accurate diagnostic decision making.
Moreover, the diagnosis of MFSdwhether or not
established correctlydcan be stigmatising, hamper
career aspirations, restrict life insurance opportunities,
and cause psychosocial burden. An international expert
panel has established a revised Ghent nosology, which
puts more weight on the cardiovascular manifestations
and in which aortic root aneurysm and ectopia lentis are
the cardinal clinical features. In the absence of any family
history, the presence of these two manifestations is
sufficient for the unequivocal diagnosis of MFS. In
absence of either of these two, the presence of
a bonafide FBN1 mutation or a combination of systemic
manifestations is required. For the latter a new scoring
system has been designed. In this revised nosology,
FBN1 testing, although not mandatory, has greater
weight in the diagnostic assessment. Special
considerations are given to the diagnosis of MFS in
children and alternative diagnoses in adults. We
anticipate that these new guidelines may delay
a definitive diagnosis of MFS but will decrease the risk of
premature or misdiagnosis and facilitate worldwide
discussion of risk and follow-up/management guidelines.
INTRODUCTION
Since Antoine-Bernard Marfan described the 5-year￾old Gabrielle with skeletal manifestations of the
disease that now bears his name,1 important
progress has been made in the delineation of the
Marfan syndrome (MFS) and recognition of asso￾ciated risks. The main features of this autosomal
dominant disorder include disproportionate long
bone overgrowth, ectopia lentis and aortic root
aneurysm. In 1955, Victor McKusick first estab￾lished a classification of connective tissue disorders,
which resulted in the publication of his monograph
‘Heritable connective tissue disorders’.
2 3 In 1986,
an international panel of experts defined a set of
clinical criteria (Berlin nosology) for the diagnosis
of MFS4 with the aim of facilitating accurate
communication about the condition between
healthcare providers, researchers and patients. It
was felt that this would improve proper patient
management and effective patient counselling.
Following the identification of FBN1 (encoding
fibrillin-1) as the causal gene for MFS,5 it was
recognised that the Berlin criteria falsely allowed
a diagnosis of MFS in individuals with a positive
family history of MFS, who had only non-specific
connective tissue findings themselves and who did
not carry the mutation present in more typically
affected family members. New diagnostic criteria
were therefore put forth in 1996, referred to as the
Ghent nosology.6 These Ghent criteria were more
stringent than the Berlin criteria, mitigating over￾diagnosis of MFS and providing better guidelines to
differentiate MFS from related, ‘overlapping’
conditions such as the MASS phenotype (myopia,
mitral valve prolapse, borderline and non-progres￾sive aortic root dilatation, skeletal findings and
striae) and mitral valve prolapse syndrome (MVPS).
Since physicians associate the diagnosis of
‘Marfan syndrome’, above all else, with risk for
aortic aneurysm/dissection, it can be detrimental to
diagnose MFS in patients without tangible evidence
of such risk. Avoidable consequences associated
with misdiagnosis of MFS include: restriction of
career aspirations or access to insurance benefits;
additional financial burden associated with
frequent medical care; anxiety or situational
depression; unfounded marital or reproductive
decisions; loss of health benefits or psychosocial
stigmatisation associated with exercise restriction,
a particularly important issue during childhood.
The challenge is to balance such concerns with the
paramount need to maintain good health through
proper counselling and application of sound antic￾ipatory medical practices. Towards this objective, it
is also important to avoid the diagnosis of MFS
when clinical or molecular observations could
reveal alternative (and often more severe) diagnoses
that mandate specialised counselling or manage￾ment protocols.
The Ghent nosology employs a set of ‘major’ and
‘minor’ manifestations in numerous tissues
including the skeletal, ocular, cardiovascular, and
pulmonary systems and the dura, skin and integu￾ment.6 Major manifestations include ectopia lentis,
aortic root dilatation/dissection, dural ectasia or
a combination of $4 out of eight major skeletal
features. The diagnosis of MFS in an index patient

requires major involvement of at least two organ systems with
minor involvement of a third organ system. In the presence of an
FBN1 mutation known to cause MFS or a first degree relative
who was unequivocally diagnosed based upon Ghent nosology,
the presence of one major and one minor manifestation in
different organ systems is sufficient to make the diagnosis.
Current status of the Ghent nosology
The Ghent criteria have found worldwide application in helping
physicians to diagnose MFS appropriately. New molecular
techniques allow the detection of FBN1 mutations in up to 97%
of Marfan patients who fulfil the Ghent criteria.7 8 This suggests
that the current Ghent criteria have excellent specificity to
identify patients with FBN1 mutations. Consideration of
sensitivity is highly complex due to varying definitions of the
‘target’ population and competing clinical priorities. For
example, the current criteria have been criticised for taking
insufficient account of the age dependent nature of some clinical
manifestations (making the diagnosis in children more difficult)9
and for including some rather non-specific physical manifesta￾tions or poorly validated diagnostic thresholds. Although the
assignment of major and minor criteria within the Ghent
nosology has contributed to its utility, several of those criteria are
not intuitive when considered from the perspective of the
differential diagnosis or patient management. Consideration of
the diagnosis of familial ectopia lentis is particularly illustrative
of the prevailing issues. This diagnostic category has been
widely applied for individuals and families that show lens
dislocation and skeletal features of MFS but do not show aortic
enlargement or dissection. FBN1 mutations are seen in familial
ectopia lentis and are not easily distinguished from those
causing MFS on the basis of character or location within the
genedsuggesting either occult phenotypeegenotype correla￾tions or the influence of modifiers.
The Ghent nosology clearly attempted to accommodate the
fact that some people with ectopia lentis, skeletal findings and
even FBN1 mutation have less cardiovascular risk (ie, risk to the
aortic root) than seen in classic MFS, by allowing the diagnosis
of familial ectopia lentis in the absence of a second major
Marfan manifestation. However, inadequate data were avail￾able to evaluate the critical issue of whether cardiovascular risk
could be predicted by the presence of non-cardiac features, such
as dural ectasia or major versus minor skeletal involvement. At
the other extreme, is it justified not to diagnose MFS in
someone with typical lens dislocation and aortic root enlarge￾ment simply because they lack minor skeletal or skin findings?
To address some of these issues, an international panel (see
acknowledgement) of experts in the diagnosis and manage￾ment of MFS was convened in Brussels, Belgium by the
National Marfan Foundation (USA) and charged with consid￾ering modifications to the Ghent criteria. Other factors under
consideration included the specialised nature, availability and
cost of diagnostic tests for selected manifestations (eg, dural
ectasia), the need to define certain diagnostic categories better
(eg, familial ectopia lentis, MASS phenotype10 and MVPS), to
define features that should trigger alternative diagnoses and
a desire to complement diagnostic criteria with follow-up, and
management guidelines for various patient groups including
children who do not yet fulfil the diagnostic criteria but may do
so in the future.
Proposal for new nosology
This proposal for a revised nosology (box 1) was based on critical
review of clinical characteristics in large published patient
cohorts,7 8 11 12 and expert opinions of the panel members with
extensive experience in applying the current criteria, the differ￾ential diagnosis of MFS, and the strengths and limitations of
molecular genetic testing. Several guiding principles were
followed: maximal use of evidence based decision making;
attention to practical (patient centric) implications; a focus on
features and criteria that distinguish MFS from other disorders;
and definition of purposeful thresholds for diagnosis. As a result,
five major changes in the diagnostic guidelines are proposed.
First, more weight is given to two cardinal features of MFS,
aortic root aneurysm/dissection and ectopia lentis. In the
absence of findings that are not expected in MFS, the combi￾nation of ectopia lentis and aortic root enlargement/dissection
should be sufficient to make the diagnosis. All other cardiovas￾cular and ocular manifestations of MFS and findings in other
organ systems, such as the skeleton, dura, skin and lungs,
contribute to a ‘systemic score’ (box 2) that guides diagnosis
when aortic disease is present but ectopia lentis is not.
Second, a more prominent role is assigned to molecular
genetic testing of FBN1 and other relevant genes (eg, TGFBR1
and 2), as well as other genes indicated in table 1. In practice,
this does not make FBN1 testing a formal requirement (which
imposes financial burden in some countries, and does not yet
have 100% sensitivity and specificity), but allows its appropriate
use when available.

Third, some of the less specific manifestations of MFS were
either removed or made less influential in the diagnostic evalu￾ation of patients. This avoids the use of obligate thresholds that
lack clear validation or general availability.
Fourth, the new criteria formalise the concept that additional
diagnostic considerations and testing are required if a patient has
sufficient findings to satisfy the criteria for MFS but also shows
unexpected findings, particularly if they segregate with disease
in the family or if they are suggestive of a specific alternative
diagnosis. Particular emphasis is placed on SphrintzeneGoldberg
syndrome (SGS), LoeyseDietz syndrome (LDS), and the
vascular form of EhlerseDanlos syndrome (vEDS). SGS and LDS
have substantial overlap with MFS, including the potential for
similar involvement of the skeleton, aortic root, skin and dura
(table 1). Occasionally, vEDS shows overlap in the vascular
system, dura, skin and skeleton. It is essential to consider
discriminating features (table 1) because each of these conditions
has a unique risk profile and management protocol.
Finally, this nosology should help to allay concerns regarding
delayed or ambiguous diagnoses by providing context specific
recommendations for patient counselling and follow-up.
In the revised nosology, new diagnostic criteria have been
defined for a sporadic patient and for an index patient with
a positive family history (box 1). In the absence of a conclusive
family history of MFS, the diagnosis can be established in four
distinct scenarios:
1. The presence of aortic root dilatation (Z-score $2 when
standardised to age and body size) or dissection13 and ectopia
lentis allows the unequivocal diagnosis of MFS, irrespective
of the presence or absence of systemic features except where
these are indicative of SGS, LDS or vEDS (table 1).
2. The presence of aortic root dilatation (Z$2) or dissection and
the identification of a bona fide FBN1 mutation (box 3) is
sufficient to establish the diagnosis even when ectopia lentis
is absent. An overview of criteria that enhance confidence in
the pathogenetic potential for MFS of particular FBN1
mutations is provided in box 3. These include missense
mutations that substitute or create cysteine residues, alter
one of the conserved residues important for calcium binding
in epidermal growth factor-like (EGF) domains, create
a premature termination codon (nonsense mutations),
delete or insert coding sequence, or disrupt the consensus
sequence for pre-mRNA splicing. Evidence for pathogenicity
of other types of missense mutations would include its
absence in at least 400 ethnically matched control chromo￾somes and co-segregation with disease in the family, or de
novo occurrence in a sporadic case (with confirmation of
paternity). Definitive evidence of linkage to a predisposing
FBN1 haplotype can substitute for an FBN1 mutation for
diagnostic purposes, but this linkage analysis requires at least
six informative meioses in the patient’s family to confirm the
MFS associated FBN1 allele. The absence of a mutation in the
FBN1 gene despite complete screening is possible in MFS.
3. Where aortic root dilatation (Z $2) or dissection is present
but ectopia lentis is absent and the FBN1 status is either
unknown or negative, an MFS diagnosis is confirmed by the
presence of sufficient systemic findings ($7 points, according
to a new scoring system) (box 2). However, features
suggestive of SGS, LDS or vEDS must be excluded and
appropriate alternative genetic testing (TGFBR1/2, collagen
biochemistry, COL3A1, and other relevant genetic testing
when indicated and available upon the discovery of other
genes) should be performed.
4. In the presence of ectopia lentis but absence of aortic root
dilatation/dissection, the identification of an FBN1 mutation
previously associated with aortic disease is required before

making the diagnosis of MFS. If the FBN1 mutation is not
unequivocally associated with cardiovascular disease in either
a related or unrelated proband, the patient should be classified
as ‘ectopia lentis syndrome’ (see differential diagnosis).
In an individual with a positive family history of MFS (where
a family member has been independently diagnosed using the
above criteria), the diagnosis can be established in the presence
of ectopia lentis, or a systemic score $7 points or aortic root
dilatation with Z $2 in adults ($20 years old) or Z $3 in
individuals <20 years old.
Special consideration should be given to young individuals
(<20 years old). In sporadic cases, these children may not fit in
one of the four proposed scenarios. If insufficient systemic
features (<7) and/or borderline aortic root measurements (Z <3)
are present (without FBN1 mutation), we suggest to use the
term ‘non-specific connective tissue disorder’ until follow-up
echocardiographic evaluation shows aortic root dilation (Z $3).
If an FBN1 mutation is identified in sporadic or familial cases but
aortic root measurements are still below Z¼3, we propose to use
the term ‘potential MFS’ until the aorta reaches threshold.
Neonatal MFS is not considered as a separate category, but
rather represents the severe end of the MFS spectrum.
In adults (>20 years), we define three main categories of
alternative diagnoses: ectopia lentis syndrome (ELS), MASS
phenotype (myopia, mitral valve prolapse, borderline (Z<2)
aortic root enlargement, skin and skeletal findings), and mitral
valve prolapse syndrome (MVPS) (see differential diagnosis).
Finally, we recognise that some patients will remain difficult
to classify due to overlap of phenotypes from different entities,
the evolving nature of these connective tissue diseases, absence
of mutation after screening of the appropriate genes, or diver￾gence between the phenotype and the genotype. However, these
patients should be uncommon and will hopefully benefit from
better definition of still unrecognised phenotypes in the future.
ORGAN SYSTEM SPECIFIC CONSIDERATIONS
Cardiovascular criteria
A key diagnostic criterion in the new nosology is aortic root
aneurysm or dissection. Aortic root aneurysm is defined as
enlargement of the aortic root at the level of the sinuses of
Valsalva. Aortic root measurements should be done parallel to
the plane of the aortic valve and perpendicular to the axis of
blood flow. The largest correctly measured root diameter
obtained from at least three transthoracic images should be
corrected for age and body size and interpreted as a Z-score.
There are varying practices regarding whether root measure￾ments should be done in systole or diastole and whether the
thickness of one aortic wall should be included (ie, the leading
edge to leading edge method). The method employed must
match that used to generate the normative data for Z-scores to
be valid. For echocardiographic measurements made from inner
wall to inner wall during systole in individuals #25 years,
a convenient Z-score calculator can be found at http://www.
marfan.org. For echocardiographic measurements made from
leading edge to leading edge in diastole in all age groups, refer￾ence graphs and Z-score equations are available13. If trans￾thoracic echocardiographic evaluations do not allow precise
visualisation of the proximal aorta, transoesophageal echocar￾diography or CT or MRI imaging should be applied, with special
attention to using double-oblique images to obtain correct
diameter measurements and use of the same nomograms.14
Mitral valve prolapse is also a common finding in MFS and is
included as a feature in the systemic score. Mitral valve prolapse
should be defined by echocardiography as protrusion of one or
both of the mitral valve leaflets across the plane of the mitral
annulus during systole. This is best detected in parasternal long
axis or apical long axis three-chamber or two-chamber views.
There are no special criteria for diagnosing MVP in MFS and
standard practices should be applied.15
Pulmonary artery (PA) dilation (eg, main PA diameter
>23 mm in adults)16 is often seen in MFS, but it is not specific
to this diagnosis. In addition, complications of pulmonary artery
disease occur rarely. PA dilation was not therefore included in
the systemic score because further research is needed regarding
thresholds and the diagnostic utility of this finding.
Patients with MFS can develop aortic enlargement or dissection
at segments distant from the aortic root. The frequency of this
finding (particularly at the proximal descending thoracic aorta and
in the abdomen) appears to be increasing with the prolonged
survival due to improved management of disease at the aortic root.
While descending aortic aneurysm or dissection in the absence of
aortic root enlargement can occur in Marfan syndrome,17 18 this is
rare and given the low specificity of this finding for MFS, this
finding is not included in the diagnostic criteria. Intermittent
imaging of the descending thoracic aorta is indicated in adult
patients where there is a clinical suspicion of Marfan syndrome in
the absence of aortic root enlargement. Widespread vascular
disease is more common with other conditions in the differential
diagnosis, such as vascular EDS and LDS. For example, systemic
vascular imaging (head to pelvis) is recommended if there is
a suspicion of LDS because of the high frequency of tortuosity,
aneurysms and dissections throughout the vascular tree.
Ocular criteria
The most prominent ocular features of MFS are myopia and
ectopia lentis. The diagnosis of ectopia lentis is based on slit￾lamp examination after maximal dilatation of the pupil. Ectopia
lentis reflects failure of supporting structures called ciliary
zonules. Dislocation of the lens in MFS is most typically upward
and temporal, but deviation in any direction may occur. If lens
subluxation is deemed equivocal or minimal, manifesting only as
a scalloped or ruffled lens margin at extremes of gaze, the eye
exam should be repeated later before a definitive diagnosis of
ectopia lentis can be made (such findings can occur outside the

context of MFS, eg, in individuals with high myopia). Increased
globe length and corneal flattening are seen in MFS, but they
have unclear specificity and are not routinely measured by
ophthalmologists. Given that myopia is very common in MFS, is
routinely monitored, and tends to show early onset, high
severity and rapid progression, myopia of >3 diopters contrib￾utes to the systemic score for diagnosis. However, since myopia
is quite a common finding in the general population we have
only attributed one point to it in the systemic score.
Systemic criteria
Clinical manifestations of MFS in other organ systems were
critically evaluated for their specificity and diagnostic utility
based on expert opinion and the available literature. Several of
the ‘minor’ criteria from the old Ghent nosology were elimi￾nated, but the most selective systemic features were included in
the ‘systemic score’.
Three points are assigned to the combination of wrist and
thumb signs. The thumb sign is positive when the entire distal
phalanx of the adducted thumb extends beyond the ulnar border
of the palm with or without the assistance of the patient or
examiner to achieve maximal adduction. The wrist sign is
positive when the tip of the thumb covers the entire fingernail of
the fifth finger when wrapped around the contralateral wrist. If
either of the two signs is absent, only one point is assigned.
Two points were assigned to each of five other specific
systemic manifestations including anterior chest deformity,
hindfoot deformity, spontaneous pneumothorax, dural ectasia
and acetabular protrusion. Pectus carinatum is believed to be
more specific for MFS than pectus excavatum and is assigned
two points. Subjective qualifiers in the original Ghent criteria
such as ‘requiring surgery’ have been eliminated, but the exam￾iner should be confident that a positive finding (pectus exca￾vatum or chest wall asymmetry) extends beyond normal
variation of chest contour in the general population before
assigning one point. Hindfoot valgus19 (two points) in combi￾nation with forefoot abduction and lowering of the midfoot
(previously referred to as medial rotation of the medial malleolus)
should be evaluated from anterior and posterior view. The
examiner should distinguish this from the more common ‘flat
foot’ (one point) without significant hindfoot valgus. As in the
past, any spontaneously occurring pneumothorax remains
a diagnostic feature. For the detection of lumbosacral dural
ectasia, no preferred method (CT or MRI) or uniformly accepted
cut-offs have emerged from the literature20e23 and local stan￾dards should apply. Dural ectasia is a sensitive but not a specific
sign of MFS and, as such, is no longer considered on equal footing
with lens dislocation or aortic root enlargement. It is commonly
seen in LDS and has been described in mutation proven vEDS.
Finally, an additional technical exam for detection of acetabular
protrusion24 can be helpful but is not mandatory: classical x-ray,
CT or MRI can be used. On an x-ray anterioreposterior pelvis
angle, the medial protrusion of the acetabulum at least 3 mm
beyond the ilio-ischial (Kohler) line is diagnostic. Criteria on CT
or MRI are not precisely defined but involve loss of the normal
oval shape of the pelvic inlet at the level of the acetabulum.
One point is assigned to eight other manifestations, one
cardiovascular (mitral valve prolapse), one ocular (myopia, $3
diopters) and six features from other organ systems. These are
considered less specific features for MFS and can be observed in
other connective tissue disorders or as normal variation in the
general population.18
The combined presence of reduced upper segment to lower
segment (US/LS) ratio (for white adults <0.85; <0.78 in black
adults; no data have been assessed in Asians) and increased arm
span to height ratio (for adults >1.05) in the absence of signif￾icant scoliosis contributes one point to the systemic score. In
Asians the incidence of an enlarged arm span to height ratio in
Marfan patients was noted to be lower25 and prior studies of
Asian (and also Afro-Caribbean) populations demonstrated
different distributions of arm span and height, so one should
consider these ethnic differences when using cut-off values.26
For the US/LS ratio in children, abnormal ratios are US/LS <1
(for age 0e5 years), US/LS <0.95 (for 6e7 years), US/LS <0.9
(8e9 years old) and <0.85 (above age 10 years). The lower
segment is defined as the distance from the top of the symphysis
pubis to the floor in the standing position, and the upper
segment is the height minus the lower segment. Importantly,
neither of these ratios provides an accurate measurement of
bone overgrowth in the presence of severe scoliosis or kyphosis.
Scoliosis27 can be diagnosed either clinically if, upon bending
forward, a vertical difference of least 1.5 cm between the ribs of
the left and right hemithorax is observed or if a Cobb’s angle
(angle between a line drawn along the superior end plate of the
superior end vertebra and a second line drawn along the inferior
end plate of the inferior end vertebra of the scoliosis measured
on anterioreposterior view of the spine) of at least 208 is seen on
radiographs. In the absence of scoliosis, one point can be
contributed by the presence of an exaggerated thoracolumbar
kyphosis. Elbow extension is considered reduced if the angle
between the upper and lower arm measures 1708 or less upon
full extension. One point can be assigned based upon facial
characteristics if the patient shows at least three of the five
typical facial characteristics including dolichocephaly, down￾ward slanting palpebral fissures, enophthalmos, retrognathia
and malar hypoplasia. Striae atrophicae are considered signifi￾cant as a diagnostic feature if they are not associated with
pronounced weight changes (or pregnancy) and if they have an
uncommon location such as the mid back, lumbar region, the
upper arm, axillary region or thigh.
The following criteria were removed from the current
nosology because of lack of perceived specificity: joint hyper￾mobility, highly arched palate, and recurrent or incisional
herniae.18
Differential diagnosis
Several conditions have been recognised which present over￾lapping clinical manifestations with MFS in the cardiovascular,
ocular or skeletal systems. These include conditions with aortic
aneurysms (LDS, bicuspid aortic valve, familial thoracic aortic
aneurysm, vEDS, arterial tortuosity syndrome), ectopia lentis
(ectopia lentis syndrome, WeileMarchesani syndrome, homo￾cystinuria, Stickler syndrome) or systemic manifestations of
MFS (ShprintzeneGoldberg syndrome, congenital contractural
arachnodactyly, LDS, MASS phenotype and MVPS (table 1).
Conditions with cardiovascular features of MFS
Historically the terms MASS phenotype and MVPS have been
used but several issues about the use of these terms have arisen.
First, the definition of the MASS phenotype is not unequivocally
applicable as it required at least two, but preferably three, of the
following manifestations: myopia, mitral valve prolapse,
borderline aortic root enlargement, skin and minor skeletal
features (insufficient to fulfil the major skeletal criterion of the
original Ghent nosology).6 This definition indirectly also
assumes a non-progressive nature of the aortic root dilatation,
but it is currently unknown to what proportion of patients this
applies. Third, FBN1 mutations have been found occasionally in

MASS phenotype patients,18 28 but the precise risk for the
development of aortic aneurysm and progression for these
patients is poorly studied. Analogous to the ectopia lentis
syndrome, the spirit of the definition of MASS phenotype aims
to avoid the diagnosis of MFS without documented risk for
aortic root aneurysm development. The diagnosis of MASS is
made in individuals with an aortic root size below Z¼2, at least
one skeletal feature and a systemic score $5. The presence of
ectopia lentis precludes this diagnosis. If an FBN1 mutation is
identified in a MASS patient, this patient has the potential to
evolve into MFS, but it is currently unknown how often and
which factors predict this transition over time.
Alternatively, when mitral valve prolapse is present in asso￾ciation with limited systemic features (score <5), we suggest use
of the term mitral valve prolapse syndrome (MVPS). MVPS is
a common condition usually inherited in autosomal dominant
mode29 with several candidate gene loci,30 but with evidence for
rare X-linked inheritance31 which affects w1.5% of the popu￾lation. In addition to prolapse of the mitral leaflets, MVPS
commonly includes pectus excavatum, scoliosis and mild
arachnodactyly.32 However, aortic enlargement and ectopia
lentis preclude this diagnosis.
LoeyseDietz syndrome (LDS) is an autosomal dominant
aortic aneurysm syndrome characterised by the triad of hyper￾telorism, bifid uvula/cleft palate, and/or arterial tortuosity with
ascending aortic aneurysm/dissection. It is caused by heterozy￾gous mutations in the genes encoding the type 1 or 2 subunit of
the transforming growth factor-b receptor (TGFBR1 or
TGFBR2).33 Other more variable clinical features that distin￾guish LDS from MFS include craniosynostosis, Chiari malfor￾mation, clubfoot deformity, congenital heart disease, cervical
spine instability, easy bruising, dystrophic scarring, translucent
skin and, most importantly, a high risk of aneurysm and
dissection throughout the arterial tree. Patients with LDS are
not typically inappropriately tall and do not exhibit dispropor￾tionally long extremities, although arachnodactyly is observed.
Some patients with TGFBR1/2 mutations lack overt craniofacial
features despite an equal or greater severity of vascular or
systemic findings. Importantly, the natural history of patients
with LDS tends to be more aggressive than those with MFS or
vEDS. In LDS, aortic dissections often occur at a younger age or
at smaller aortic dimensions (<40 mm) compared to MFS, and
the incidence of pregnancy related complications is particularly
high.34 As with FBN1 mutations, the phenotype associated with
TGFBR1/2 mutations can be variable, even within families, and
can be associated with skeletal features of MFS leading to
overlapping phenotypes in the old Ghent nosology.35e37 In order
to avoid persistent ambiguity even under the proposed criteria,
molecular testing should be strongly considered because it
influences the clinical management.34 It has been proposed that
patients with TGFBR1/2 mutations who lack outward discrim￾inating features of LDS should be designated LDS2, highlighting
the potential for more aggressive vascular disease than seen in
Marfan syndrome (MIM 190181 and 190182).
With a population prevalence of up to 1%,38 39 bicuspid aortic
valve (BAV) is the most common congenital cardiac malforma￾tion. A subset of individuals with BAV present with ascending
aortic aneurysm; however, such patients usually lack ocular or
other systemic findings that contribute strongly to MFS diag￾nosis. Skeletal findings such as pectus deformity and scoliosis
can be observed in these families. BAV and aortic aneurysm can
occur together in some family members but independently in
others, indicating that they can be variably penetrant conse￾quences of a common underlying genetic defect.40 41 Unlike
MFS, this condition commonly shows maximal or exclusive
dilatation in the ascending aorta above the sinotubular junc￾tion.42 Mutations have been identified in the NOTCH1 and
KCNJ2 genes, but these account for only a small fraction of BAV
patients, who may have prominent valve calcification or asso￾ciated forms of congenital heart disease. Linkage analysis reveals
genetic heterogeneity with putative loci on chromosomes 18q,
5q and 13q.43
Familial thoracic aortic aneurysm and dissection syndrome
(FTAAD) is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of
disorders where thoracic aortic disease predominates. The age of
onset and rate of progression of aortic dilatation is highly vari￾able and conditions that include variable or subtle systemic
manifestations of a connective tissue disorder have been
included in this designation. It is anticipated that future strati￾fication of patients by genetic aetiology will help to refine
phenotypic descriptions and inform patient counselling and
management. To date, there are five genes and two additional
loci44 45 associated with FTAAD. Mutations have been identified
in FBN1, TGFBR1/2, MYH11, and ACTA2, the latter two
encoding components in the smooth muscle cell contractile
apparatus. Mutations in MYH11 associate aortic root aneurysms
with patent ductus arteriosus (PDA).46 Mutations in ACTA2,
accounting for up to 16% of FTAAD, associate aortic aneurysm
with other variable features including iris flocculi, livedo retic￾ularis, cerebral aneurysm, BAV and PDA.47 In addition to
thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections, patients with ACTA2
mutations can present with vascular disease in the cerebrovas￾cular system (premature ischaemic strokes, Moyamoya disease
and cerebral aneurysms) or premature coronary artery disease.48
The vascular type of EDS (previously EDS IV), is caused by
mutations in COL3A1, the gene encoding type III collagen; it is
characterised by vascular and tissue fragility. Cardinal features
distinguishing vEDS from MFS include translucent skin, easy
bruising, dystrophic scarring and a tendency for intestinal or
uterine rupture. Typically, dissection or rupture occurs in
medium sized arteries in vEDS, although aortic involvement is
sometimes observed. There is no particular predisposition at the
aortic root. About half of the aneurysms/dissections occur in
thoracic or abdominal branch arteries; arteries of the head, neck
and limbs are less frequently involved.49
Three other rare types of EDS have been associated with
vascular problems. The kyphoscoliotic type (previously type VI
EDS) is characterised by kyphoscoliosis, joint laxity, and muscle
hypotonia. This autosomal recessive condition is caused by
defects in the enzymatic activity of lysyl hydroxylase, encoded
by the PLOD1 gene. Aortic dilation/dissection and rupture of
medium sized arteries have been observed.50 Patients with the
so-called ‘cardiac valvular subtype of EDS’, which associates
severe cardiac valvular problems and features of the classic type
of EDS (atrophic scars, skin hyperelasticiy and joint hypermo￾bility), were found to have a complete deficiency of the proa2-
chain of type I collagen (COL1A2).51 Most recently, patients
with arginine to cysteine substitutions in the proa1-chain of
type I collagen (COL1A1) displayed classic EDS but evolved to
a vascular EDS-like phenotype later in life, with increased risk
for spontaneous arterial rupture, most prominently affecting the
femoral and iliac arteries.52
Arterial tortuosity syndrome (ATS) is a rare autosomal
recessive connective tissue disorder, characterised by severe
tortuosity, stenosis, and aneurysms of the aorta and medium
sized arteries.53 Skeletal and skin involvement is common. The
underlying genetic defect is homozygosity or compound
heterozygosity for loss-of-function mutations in SLC2A10, the

gene encoding the facilitative glucose transporter GLUT10.54
The condition is lethal in infancy in a subset of patients, but
some survive into adulthood and seem to do well.55
Conditions with ectopia lentis
Patients with familial ectopia lentis typically have some skeletal
features of MFS and an FBN1 mutation. While lack of aortic
disease is a defining feature of this condition, it may be difficult to
distinguish from emerging MFS in the absence of other affected
family members or at a young age. Even within extended pedi￾grees with familial ectopia lentis, later onset aortic aneurysm may
be observed. In order to better highlight the systemic nature of
this condition and to emphasise the need for assessment
of features outside the ocular system, we propose the designation
ectopia lentis syndrome (ELS). The presence of a personal or
family history of aortic aneurysm, or the identification of an FBN1
mutation previously associated with aortic aneurysm, would be
sufficient to transition the diagnosis to MFS, independently of the
number or distribution of systemic features. To ensure that
adequate vigilance of other organ systems is maintained, the
diagnosis of ELS cannot be formally invoked before the age of
20 years. The disorder is genetically heterogeneous, with auto￾somal dominant inheritance caused by FBN1 mutations56 and
recessive forms caused by LTBP2 and ADAMTSL4 mutations.57 58
Importantly, in ELS patients with FBN1 mutations, cardiovascular
follow-up by imaging should be maintained throughout life.
Ectopia lentis can be present as a component of other rare
conditions. Ectopia lentis et pupillae is an autosomal recessive
condition in which remnants of the pupillary membrane are
present. However, it is not associated with cardiovascular or
skeletal features of MFS.
In WeilleMarchesani syndrome (WMS), the lens dislocation is
typically associated with microspherophakia (small, rounded
and thickened crystalline lens) and a shallow anterior eye
chamber. WMS patients are short with brachydactyly and joint
stiffness. Both autosomal dominant and recessive forms of WMS
have been described and are caused by FBN1 mutations59 60 or
mutations in the ADAMTS10 gene,61 respectively. Homo￾cystinuria is often easily differentiated from MFS by the pres￾ence of mental retardation and thrombosis, and can be excluded
by urine amino acid analysis in the absence of pyridoxine
supplementation. In homocystinuria, the lens usually dislocates
downward due to complete loss of support by ciliary zonules. In
Stickler syndrome, patients can present with a Marfanoid
habitus. Typical ocular signs include vitreal degeneration, retinal
detachment, myopia and open angle glaucoma. Early cataracts
are common, but lens subluxation is not. Other potential
discriminating features from MFS include cleft palate, hearing
loss and epiphysial changes of the bones.
Conditions with overlapping systemic features
ShprintzeneGoldberg syndrome (SGS) is a rare craniosynostosis
syndrome characterised by some of the systemic features found
in MFS (pectus abnormalities, scoliosis, arachnodactyly),
craniofacial dysmorphism (exophthalmos, hypertelorism,
downslanting palpebral fissures, maxillary and mandibular
hypoplasia, high arched palate and low set ears) and develop￾mental delay. So far, only two SGS patients have shown an
FBN1 mutation.62 63 Another patient reported by Kosaki et al63
as SGS was felt to have LDS based on arterial tortuosity and the
presence of a bifid uvula.64 Other important distinguishing
features between SGS and either LDS or MFS are the high
incidence of cognitive impairment and the low frequency of
vascular disease in the former.
Congenital contractural arachnodactyly (CCA) is an auto￾somal dominant disorder characterised by a Marfan-like body
habitus and arachnodactyly.65 Most affected individuals have
‘crumpled’ ears that present as a folded upper helix, and
contractures of major joints (knees and ankles) at birth. The
proximal interphalangeal joints of the fingers and toes have
flexion contractures (camptodactyly). Kyphosis/scoliosis is
present in about half of affected individuals. Mild enlargement
of the sinuses of Valsalva has been reported, but there is no
evidence that the aortic dilatation progresses to dissection or
rupture.66 CCA is caused by mutations in FBN2, the gene
encoding the extracellular matrix protein fibrillin-2.67
MANAGEMENT
Management guidelines for MFS patients
Aortic root dilatation in MFS is usually progressive. Therefore
absence of aortic root enlargement on initial clinical examination
does not necessarily exclude the diagnosis, even in adulthood.
All individuals who meet the criteria for MFS should initially
have at least yearly echocardiograms. More frequent imaging
should be performed if the aortic diameter is approaching
a surgical threshold ($4.5 cm in adults; less well defined in
children) or shows rapid change ($0.5 cm/year) or with
concerns regarding heart or valve function. Individuals under age
20 with systemic findings suggestive of MFS but no cardiovas￾cular involvement should have annual echocardiograms due to
the potential for rapid evolution of the phenotype. Adults with
repeatedly normal aortic root measurements can be seen at
intervals of 2e3 years.
Although several alternative medical treatments have been
proposed (angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors,
calcium channel antagonists), the standard of care in most
centres for the prevention of aortic complications in MFS
remains b-blockade.68 More data are required before ACE
inhibitor therapy can be considered standard treatment.69 b￾blockade should be considered in all patients with MFS,
including children and those with aortic root diameters <4 cm,
unless contraindicated. The b-blocker should be titrated to
effect, aimed at a heart rate after submaximal exercise (eg,
running up and down two flights of stairs) <100 beats/min in
individuals over 5 years of age. Angiotensin receptor blockers
(ARBs) have shown the ability to prevent aortic enlargement in
a mouse model of Marfan syndrome,70 and encouraging results
were observed in a pilot experience in children with severe
MFS.71 Several multicentre trials of losartan versus or on top of
atenolol in MFS are currently underway.72 If b-blockers are
contraindicated or not tolerated, other classes of antihyperten￾sive agents can be used, but there is not definitive evidence that
they will afford protection in people with MFS.
Management of acute dissection of the ascending aorta (type
A dissection) is emergency surgery. Consideration of prophy￾lactic surgery is recommended when the diameter at the sinuses
of Valsalva approaches 5.0 cm. Other factors that inform the
timing of surgery include a family history of early dissection, the
rate of aortic root growth, the severity of aortic valve regurgi￾tation, associated mitral valve disease, ventricular dysfunction,
pregnancy planning in women, and the desire for a valve sparing
operation.
Type B dissection (originating in the thoracic descending
aorta) accounts for about 10% of all dissections in MFS. Possible
indications for surgery include intractable pain, limb or organ
ischaemia, an aortic diameter exceeding 5.5 cm, or a rapid
increase in the aortic diameter. Open surgery is still preferred as
experience with intravascular stenting in MFS is very limited,

and the pressure endovascular stents need to apply against the
wall of adjacent normal sized aortic segments to remain well
seated may not be tolerated by weakened connective tissue, or
the adjacent aorta may also be dilated. Regular imaging of the
entire aorta is encouraged after root surgery and in adulthood.
Mitral valve repair or replacement is advised for severe mitral
valve regurgitation with associated symptoms or progressive left
ventricular dilatation or dysfunction. Repair should be consid￾ered, especially in patients undergoing aortic valve sparing root
replacement. If a mechanical aortic valve prosthesis is chosen,
mitral valve replacement may be considered, although preser￾vation of left ventricular function may be better with mitral
valve repair. After isolated mitral valve repair, one should care￾fully monitor aortic root size as increased rates of enlargement
have been observed.
Decisions regarding exercise restriction should always be made
on an individual basis. Recommendations from the National
Marfan Foundation (http://www.marfan.org) and guidelines
from the American Heart Association/American College of
Cardiology task forces73 are useful templates. In general,
patients with MFS should avoid contact sports, exercise to
exhaustion and especially isometric activities involving
a Valsalva manoeuvre. Most patients can and should participate
in aerobic activities performed in moderation.
Pregnancy in MFS women is associated with increased
cardiovascular risk, with the majority of aortic complications
(progressive dilatation and dissection) occurring in the third
trimester or in the early postpartum period. The risk of aortic
root complication is increased when the aortic root diameter is
above 4.0 cm at the start of the pregnancy.74
Annual ophthalmological evaluation for the detection of
ectopia lentis, cataract, glaucoma and retinal detachment is
essential. Early monitoring and aggressive refraction is required
for children with MFS to prevent amblyopia. Indications for
surgical lens extraction include lens opacity with poor visual
function, anisometropia or refractive error not amenable to
optical correction, impending complete luxation, and lens
induced glaucoma or uveitis.
Skeletal manifestations such as scoliosis and pectus deformity
should be treated according to standard orthopaedic manage￾ment rules.
Management guidelines for related conditions
Regular follow-up including annual cardiovascular imaging and
ophthalmological evaluation is advised in MASS, MVPS and ELS
to monitor aortic size, and the degree of mitral regurgitation,
over time. Counselling for patients with either ELS or MASS
phenotype should include the risk of a more severe presentation
in their offspring, including aortic enlargement.
Careful cardiovascular and ophthalmological follow-up is
strongly indicated in children with potential MFS or non-specific
connective tissue disorders.
CONCLUSION
The diagnostic evaluation for MFS is unavoidably complex due
to the highly variable presentation of affected individuals, the
age dependent nature of many of its manifestations, the absence
of gold standards, and its extensive differential diagnosis. While
diagnostic criteria should emphasise simplicity of use and the
desire for early diagnosis, accuracy receives highest priority in
order to avoid the deleterious and often irreversible consequences
of ungrounded or erroneous assignment. While the increased
focus on vascular disease for the diagnosis of MFS in this
proposal will likely prove controversial, it is responsive to the
practical burden faced both by patients and physicians and does
not represent a true departure from the spirit of prior diagnostic
guidelines. Ongoing concerns about delayed diagnosis and/or the
use of diagnostic categories that may prove provisional should
be offset by additional discussion of ongoing risk and the defi￾nition of follow-up and management principles. A comparative
analysis on different retrospective datasets has shown w90%
concordance between the old and revised Ghent nosology. The
10% discordance was generally beneficial by facilitating earlier
diagnosis in young children with a convincing clinical pheno￾type and delayed diagnosis in individuals without clear cardio￾vascular risk. The current proposal will benefit from
a prospective analysis, leading to further refinement. A web
based diagnostic tool for the application of these criteria can be
accessed at http://www.marfan.org.
