Abstract
Background: An increased prevalence of splenectomy has been
reported in patients with idiopathic pulmonary arterial
hypertension. Examination of small pulmonary arteries from these
subjects has revealed multiple thrombotic lesions, suggesting that
thrombosis may contribute to this condition. Based on these
findings, we hypothesised that splenectomy could be a risk factor
for chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH), a
condition defined by the absence of thrombus resolution after acute
pulmonary embolism that causes sustained obstruction of the
pulmonary arteries and subsequent pulmonary hypertension.
Methods: The medical history, clinical characteristics, thrombotic
risk factors and haemodynamics of 257 patients referred for CTEPH
between 1989 and 1999 were reviewed. In a case-control study the
prevalence of splenectomy in patients with CTEPH was compared
with that of patients evaluated during the same period for
idiopathic pulmonary hypertension (n = 276) or for lung
transplantation in other chronic pulmonary conditions (n = 180).
Results: In patients with CTEPH, 8.6% (95% CI 5.2 to 12.0) had a
history of splenectomy compared with 2.5% (95% CI 0.7 to 4.4)
and 0.56% (95% CI 0 to 1.6) in cases of idiopathic pulmonary
arterial hypertension and other chronic pulmonary conditions,
respectively (p<0.01).


Conclusion: Splenectomy may be a risk factor for chronic
thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension.
