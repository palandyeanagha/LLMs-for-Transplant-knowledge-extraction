IgA nephropathy (IgAN) is characterized by circulating immune complexes composed of galactose-deficient
IgA1 and a glycan-specific IgG antibody. These immune complexes deposit in the glomerular mesangium and
induce the mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis characteristic ofIgAN. To define the precise specificities
and molecular properties of the IgG antibodies, we generated EBV-immortalized IgG-secreting lymphocytes
from patients with IgAN and found that the secreted IgG formed complexes with galactose-deficientIgA1 in a
glycan-dependent manner. We cloned and sequenced the heavy- and light-chain antigen-binding domains of
IgG specific for galactose-deficient IgA1 and identified an A to S substitution in the complementarity-deter￾mining region 3 ofthe variable region ofthe gene encoding the IgG heavy chain in IgAN patients. Furthermore,
site-directed mutagenesis that reverted the residue to alanine reduced the binding of recombinantIgG to galac￾tose-deficientIgA1. Finally, we developed a dot-blot assay for the glycan-specific IgG antibody that differenti￾ated patients with IgAN from healthy and disease controls with 88% specificity and 95% sensitivity and found
that elevated levels of this antibody in the sera of patients with IgAN correlated with proteinuria. Collectively,
these findings indicate that glycan-specific antibodies are associated with the development of IgAN and may
represent a disease-specific marker and potential therapeutic target.
Introduction
IgA nephropathy (IgAN), also called Berger disease, was 
described in 1968 (1) based on the immunohistochemical find￾ing of IgA- and IgG-containing immune complexes in the glo￾merular mesangium of the kidney. Proliferation of mesangial 
cells and expansion of the extracellular matrix can occur from 
the earliest stages of the disease, with progression to glomerular 
and interstitial sclerosis resulting in development of end-stage 
renal disease in 30%–40% patients within 20 years of the esti￾mated time of disease onset (2, 3).
The IgA in the mesangial deposits is exclusively of the IgA1 
subclass (4–6) and is aberrantly glycosylated (7–9) with the hinge￾region O-linked glycans being deficient in galactose (Gal) (10–14). 
The IgA1 in the circulation of patients with IgAN also carries Gal￾deficient O-glycans, although Gal-deficient variants are rarely 
found in the IgA1 in sera from normal individuals (7–9, 15). The 
production of these variants is due to altered expression of specific 
glycosyltransferases in the IgA1-producing cells (16–19).
It is the binding of IgA1-containing immune complexes with 
aberrantly glycosylated IgA1 (11–13, 20–22) to mesangial cells 
that induces the renal manifestations characteristic of IgAN 
(23–26); however, the events that initiate the disease process are 
most likely of extrarenal origin, as IgAN recurs in more than 50% 
of patients within 2 years of kidney transplantation (27). Thus, 
the factors that favor the formation of the circulating immune 
complexes in these patients are of particular interest. Although 
it is known that the aberrantly glycosylated IgA1 is recognized 
by glycan-specific antibodies of the IgG or IgA1 isotypes from 
patients with IgAN as well as from healthy individuals (13, 21, 
28–30), little is known concerning the precise specificities and 
molecular properties of the antibodies.
EBV-immortalized Ig-producing cells from IgAN patients and 
healthy controls offer what we believe is a novel tool for charac￾terization of the anti-IgA1 antibodies as well as IgA1 glycosylation 
(19, 30). In the present study, we subcloned IgG-producing cells 
from IgAN patients, healthy controls, and non-IgAN renal-disease 
controls, generated stable single-cell clones producing IgG specific 
for Gal-deficient IgA1, and characterized these antibodies at the 
molecular level. Subclones of EBV-immortalized B lymphocytic 
cell lines from IgAN patients produced IgG that formed complexes 
with Gal-deficient IgA1. Sequencing of the cloned heavy- and light￾chain antigen-binding domains of IgG specific for Gal-deficient

IgA1 identified in IgAN patients an A to S substitution in the com￾plementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) of the variable region 
of the IgG heavy chain; site-directed mutagenesis confirmed the 
role of the serine residue in binding to Gal-deficient IgA1. Thus, 
the anti-glycan antibodies with unique features in the CDR3 are 
associated with the development of IgAN.
Results
Serum IgG from IgAN patients exhibits specificity for N-acetylgalactos￾amine, which results in binding with Gal-deficient and desialylated IgA1. 
We first determined the binding of serum IgG from IgAN patients 
to Gal-deficient IgA1 using an ELISA in which the coated antigen 
was either enzymatically desialylated and degalactosylated IgA1 
(dd-IgA1) or the Fab fragment of Gal-deficient IgA1 containing 
the N-terminal part of the hinge region with O-glycans attached 
(Fab-IgA1) (Supplemental Table 1; supplemental material avail￾able online with this article; doi:10.1172/JCI38468DS1). The levels 
of serum IgG directed against dd-IgA1 and Fab-IgA1 were higher in 
IgAN patients than in healthy controls (P < 0.001) (Supplemental 
Table 2). These results, obtained using samples from 16 patients 
and 16 healthy controls from the southeastern USA, were corrobo￾rated using serum samples from 20 IgAN patients and 20 healthy 
controls from Japan (P < 0.0001) (Supplemental Table 2).
The binding of the serum IgG to Gal-deficient IgA1 was then 
validated by Western blot analysis of the component chains of an 
enzymatically modified IgA1 myeloma protein (Mce). In each case, 
the enzymatic modification was confirmed by the binding of the 
N-acetylgalactosamine–specific (GalNAc-specific) lectin, Helix asper￾sa agglutinin (HAA) (31, 32). The IgG from the sera of patients with 
IgAN bound to the heavy chain of the Gal-deficient IgA1, whereas 
only minimal binding of the IgG from the sera of healthy controls 
was observed. Removal of the sialic acid from the Gal-deficient 
IgA1 by neuraminidase treatment resulted in an increase in the 
binding of the serum IgG from patients with IgAN (Figure 1A). As 
would be expected, dd-IgA1 bound greater amounts of HAA than 
did native Gal-deficient IgA1, whereas enzymatically regalactosyl￾ated or resialylated dd-IgA1 bound lower amounts of HAA than 
native Gal-deficient IgA1 (Figure 1B). The similarity between the 
extent of binding of the serum IgG and HAA to each of these IgA1 
preparations suggested that the binding of serum IgG to the Gal￾deficient IgA1 was dependent on the GalNAc moieties (Figure 1B). 
This was confirmed by incubation with unlabeled HAA prior to 
incubation with IgG purified from the serum of an IgAN patient. 
The preincubation with HAA reduced the binding of the IgG to the 
Gal-deficient IgA1 by 66% (Figure 1, C and D); conversely, blocking 
with serum IgG from an IgAN patient reduced the binding of HAA 
to Gal-deficient IgA1 by 60% (Figure 1, C and D). Thus, the GalNAc 
in the hinge region of Gal-deficient IgA1 represents a major com￾ponent of the epitope that is recognized by the IgG specific for Gal￾deficient IgA1 present in the serum of patients with IgAN.
Characterization of antibodies specific for Gal-deficient IgA1 secreted by 
IgG-producing cell lines. To further characterize the IgG that reacts 
with the Gal-deficient IgA1, we generated IgG-producing cells by 
EBV immortalization of B cells isolated from the peripheral blood 
of the 16 patients with IgAN and 16 healthy controls who had pro￾vided blood for measurement of serum IgG specific for Gal-defi￾cient IgA1 (Supplemental Table 2). After subcloning of the cells, the 
IgG secreted by the cell lines was characterized by ELISA; the cells 
Figure 1
Serum IgG from IgAN patients exhibits specificity for GalNAc, binding to Gal-deficient and desialylated IgA1. (A) Western blot analysis with Gal￾deficient IgA1 (Mce) as antigen demonstrated binding of serum IgG from 2 IgAN patients but only minimal binding of IgG from 2 healthy controls 
to the IgA1 heavy chain. After removal of sialic acid, IgG binding increased, as it did for binding to HAA. N+, treated with neuraminidase; N-, not 
treated with neuraminidase. (B) To test glycan-specific IgG binding to GalNAc, these IgA1 proteins were used: lane 1, Gal-deficient IgA1 (Mce); 
lane 2, dd-IgA1; lane 3, enzymatically regalactosylated dd-IgA1; and lane 4, enzymatically resialylated dd-IgA1. dd-IgA1 bound the greatest 
amount of HAA, with enzymatically galactosylated or sialylated dd-IgA1 binding very little. IgG from an IgAN patient bound to these antigens in 
a fashion similar to that for HAA. (C and D) Component chains of Gal-deficient IgA1 (Mce) were separated by SDS-PAGE under reducing condi￾tions and electroblotted. The membrane was then treated with HAA to assess whether blockade with this GalNAc-specific lectin can inhibit IgG 
binding. The intensity of each band was quantified by densitometry. The binding of serum IgG from an IgAN patient to Gal-deficient IgA1 was 
reduced by 66% after treatment with HAA. Conversely, blocking with serum IgG from an IgAN patient reduced the binding of HAA to Gal-deficient 
IgA1 by 60%. Binding of anti-human IgA (heavy-chain specific) confirmed equivalent loading. Representative results from 3 experiments are 
shown in A–C; lanes were run on the same gel but were noncontiguous.

derived from IgAN patients produced antibodies that exhibited 
greater binding to dd-IgA1 and Fab-IgA1 than did the cells derived 
from controls (P < 0.0001) (Figure 2, A and B). We then randomly 
selected cell lines from 10 IgAN patients and 10 healthy controls 
and analyzed the binding of the secreted IgG to a synthetic IgA1 
hinge-region peptide linked to BSA (HR-BSA) and a synthetic IgA1 
hinge-region glycopeptide linked to BSA with 3 GalNAc residues 
(HR-GalNAc-BSA) at sites corresponding to the major epitopes 
of the Gal-deficient IgA1 myeloma protein (Thr228, Ser230, and 
Ser232) (25). The IgG from the cells derived from IgAN patients 
did not bind the HR-BSA but bound HR-GalNAc-BSA; moreover, 
the binding to HR-GalNAc-BSA was inhibited by HAA (78%) (Fig￾ure 2C). Thus, the IgG-secreting cells derived from the peripheral 
blood of patients with IgAN produced glycan-specific antibodies 
that recognize Gal-deficient IgA1 in a GalNAc-dependent manner. 
These IgG-producing cells were further subcloned to isolate single￾cell clones producing antibodies specific for Gal-deficient IgA1. 
We randomly selected 3 cell lines from clones from patients with 
IgAN (n = 16) and 3 cell lines from clones from healthy controls 
(n = 16) and scaled up the cultures to obtain sufficient amounts of 
purified IgG for further characterization.
Glycan-specific IgG forms immune complexes with Gal-deficient IgA1. 
The ability of the glycan-specific antibodies to form immune 
complexes with Gal-deficient IgA1 was determined in vitro by 
incubation of the purified IgG proteins with a Gal-deficient 
IgA1 myeloma protein (Ale mono) at a 1:1 molar ratio. The reac￾tion mixture was then fractionated by HPLC with the IgA1-IgG 
immune complexes being identified by cross-capture ELISA (25). 
Incubation of the Gal-deficient IgA1 with IgG produced by the 
cells derived from IgAN patients resulted in the production of 
greater amounts of immune complexes than were formed on incu￾bation with IgG produced by cells derived from healthy controls 
(Figure 3A). Analysis of the size and composition of the immune 
complexes suggested that they were composed of 1 molecule of 
IgG bound to either 1 or 2 molecules of IgA1 (Figure 3A).
Analyses of the IGH, IGκ, and IGλ genes derived from patients with IgAN. 
The variable regions of IGH and IGκ or IGλ transcripts from single 
cells were amplified in 2 rounds of nested RT-PCR reactions using 
specific primers (33). The resultant amplicons were then purified 
and directly sequenced. The predicted aa sequences of the CDR3 
of the variable region of the IGH gene (VH genes) from the 7 IgAN 
patients analyzed differed significantly from the predicted sequenc￾es for the genes of the 6 healthy controls that were analyzed (Tables 
1 and 2). One of the notable differences was that the 3′ end of VH
genes from cells of 6 IgAN patients included a sequence encoding 
YCSR/K, which represented an A to S substitution as compared 
with the sequence encoding YCAR that was identified in 5 of 6 
controls (Table 1). In the 1 IgAN patient (subject 3081) who did 
not have the A to S substitution at this position, there was an R to 
T substitution at the next position (YCAT vs. YCAR). On dot-blot 
analysis, we found extensive binding of the IgG secreted by the cells 
from the IgAN patients to Gal-deficient IgA1 with 1 exception (IgG 
from the clone from subject 3081; Figure 3B). The IgG secreted 
by the cells from the healthy controls either did not bind to Gal￾deficient IgA1 or exhibited significantly less binding, again with 1 
exception (IgG from the clone from subject 3070 with the sequence 
YCAS) (Figure 3B). Densitometric analysis of these blots indicated 
that the IgG from IgAN patients exhibited greater binding to Gal￾deficient IgA1 than did the IgG from healthy controls (Figure 3C; 
P < 0.01). Thus, the CDR3 of the VH appears to play an important 
role in the binding of the glycan-specific IgG to the Gal-deficient 
IgA1, and the A to S substitution that we found in 6 of 7 patients 
with IgAN appears to be associated with enhanced binding.
The importance of the A to S substitution in the YCAR/K sequence of the 
CDR3 in the binding of IgG to Gal-deficient IgA1. For further analyses, 
we prepared recombinant human IgG (rIgG) using a single-cell 
PCR technique to clone the variable regions of the heavy- and light￾chain genes of IgG from an IgG-secreting cell line derived from a 
patient with IgAN and from an IgG-secreting cell line derived from 
a healthy control. The corresponding PCR products for heavy and 
light chains were subcloned into Igγ and Igκ or λ expression vec￾tors, respectively, to express rIgG1, also matching the original 
subclass of the identified antibodies. Western blot analysis dem￾onstrated that the rIgG from the IgAN patient bound to Gal-defi￾cient IgA1 myeloma protein (Ale poly) (Figure 4A), and this was 
confirmed by ELISA using Fab-IgA1. Furthermore, we purified the 
Fab fragment of the rIgG from an IgAN patient to confirm the role 
of the antigen-binding region in the interaction with Gal-deficient

to HR-GalNAc in an HAA-inhibitable fashion. *P < 0.001; data are shown as the mean ± SD. P values were generated using 2-tailed Student’s t 
test. The experiments were repeated 3 times with similar results.

IgA1. ELISA data confirmed that the Fab fragment of rIgG bound 
to Fab-IgA1 in a fashion similar to that of the intact rIgG. Western 
blotting against the hinge region of native IgA1, desialylated IgA1, 
and dd-IgA1 myeloma proteins (Mce1) confirmed that the binding 
of the rIgG to IgA1 was increased after removal of sialic acid and 
Gal on the hinge region of IgA1 (Figure 4B).
To determine whether the aa substitution (A to S) in the CDR3 
of the VH domain of IgG from IgAN patients affects the bind￾ing to Gal-deficient IgA1, the VH gene of the single-cell line from 
an IgAN patient (subject 1123) with the YCSR sequence was 
reverted to the counterpart found in most healthy controls (S 
to A) using an overlap PCR strategy (Supplemental Table 3) (34). 
Conversely, the CDR3 of the VH gene of the single-cell line from a 
healthy control (subject 9017) encoding the YCAR sequence was 
mutated (A to S) to generate the sequence found in most of the 
IgAN patients. Both mutations were confirmed by sequencing 
after cloning into an IgG-expressing vector, as described above 
(Figure 4C). The rIgG was then purified and tested for binding 
to Gal-deficient IgA1 using Western blotting and ELISA. The S 
to A change in the CDR3 of the IgG of the IgAN patient reduced 
the binding of rIgG to Gal-deficient IgA1 by 72%. Conversely, 
the A to S substitution in CDR3 of the IgG of a healthy con￾trol increased binding to Gal-deficient IgA1 to 80% of that of the 
rIgG of the IgAN patient (Figure 4D). These data were confirmed 
by ELISA using Fab-IgA1 as the antigen.
Serum levels of IgG specific for Gal-deficient IgA1 are elevated in 
patients with IgAN. As we had found that patients with IgAN have 
higher levels of circulating IgG antibodies with specificity for 
Gal-deficient IgA1, we further evaluated the quantitative dif￾ferences using what we believe is a novel dot-blot assay that we 
developed for this purpose (see Methods). We found that the 
IgAN patients (n = 60) had elevated levels of serum IgG specific 
for Gal-deficient IgA1 as compared with disease controls (n = 20) 
and healthy controls (n = 40) (Figure 5, A and B). The rela￾tive intensity values for the serum IgG antibodies from IgAN 
patients in both cohorts, disease controls, and healthy controls

exhibited more binding to Gal-deficient IgA1 as compared with the binding of IgG from healthy controls. Immune complexes likely contained 1 or 
2 molecules of IgA1 bound to 1 molecule of IgG. Data are shown as mean ± SD. (B) Dot-blot analysis showed that IgG secreted by cell lines from

were 33.2 ± 14.6, 9.9 ± 3.9, and 9.0 ± 6.8, respectively (Figure 5B; 
P < 0.0001). To test the reproducibility of this assay, the same 
serum samples were reanalyzed twice, and the difference between 
the experiments was 3.5% ± 2.3%. Notably, 54 of the 60 patients 
with IgAN had mean binding values higher than the 90th per￾centile of those for healthy controls. A receiver operating charac￾teristic curve (ROC) analysis indicated the area under the curve 
was 0.9644 (Figure 5C; P < 0.0001); when the level of serum IgG 
specific for Gal-deficient IgA1 specificity reached 95.0%, the 
corresponding sensitivity was 88.3%. Furthermore, for 20 IgAN 
patients with urine and blood samples collected within 30 days 
of renal biopsy (contemporaneous samples), we assessed pos￾sible correlations among clinical and laboratory findings. The 
results of these analyses showed that the intensity of binding of 
IgG to Gal-deficient IgA1 as determined by the dot-blot analysis 
correlated with proteinuria (expressed as urinary protein/uri￾nary creatinine [UP/Cr] ratio; Figure 5D; P < 0.0001) as well as 
with urinary IgA-IgG immune complexes (expressed relative to 
Cr concentration; Figure 5E; P = 0.0082).
Discussion
The results of our studies provide evidence that sera and culture 
supernatants of EBV-immortalized peripheral B cells of patients 
with IgAN contain elevated levels of IgG antibodies specific for 
the Gal-deficient hinge-region O-glycans of IgA1. Comparative 
evolutionary studies of this structurally unique hinge region of 
IgA in many species indicate that IgA1 in humans, chimpanzees, 
and gorillas was generated by an insertion of a gene segment 
encoding an additional 13 amino acids into phylogenetically 
older IgA that structurally resembles human IgA2 (35, 36). The 
origin of this insertion remains obscure: there is no pronounced 
sequence homology to any other glycoprotein, and the hinge 
region of human IgA1 is the only known substrate for the family of 
enzymes, bacterial IgA-specific proteases, that cleave human IgA1 
into Fab and Fc fragments with functionally important biological 
consequences (37). Although the structural and functional impact 
conferred by the hinge-region insertion into hominoid primate 
IgA1 remains elusive, it is obvious that alterations in the associat￾ed glycan moieties are of paramount significance in IgAN (21, 24, 
25). Our data indicate that GalNAc plays an important role in the 
interaction between IgG and Gal-deficient IgA1. GalNAc appears 
to act as an epitope in itself, as indicated by additional experiments 
that assessed binding of this IgG antibody to GalNAc- or N-acetyl￾glucosamine–Sepharose (GlcNAc-Sepharose), although it is pos￾sible that differences in glycosylation may affect the hinge-region 
protein backbone conformation and contribute to the epitope 
configuration. Thus, these results confirmed and extended our 
previous report (21) indicating that GalNAc-Sepharose inhibited 
reformation of dissociated IgA1-containing immune complexes 
isolated from the circulation of patients with IgAN.
The development of a dot-blot assay using Gal-deficient IgA1 
as an antigen and GalNAc-specific rIgG from an IgAN patient as 
a standard permitted accurate analysis of the levels of glycan-spe￾cific IgG in the sera with high specificity and sensitivity. Notably, 
our results showed that serum levels of this IgG that is specific 
for Gal-deficient IgA1 correlated with the clinical parameter of 
proteinuria as well as with levels of urinary IgA1-IgG immune 
complexes, suggesting that the levels of these antibodies may 
represent a marker of disease activity and thus may be useful in 
assessing response to treatment.
The finding that the binding of the glycan-specific IgG from 
patients with IgAN to Gal-deficient IgA1 greatly favored the for￾mation of immune complexes suggests that these glycan-specific 
antibodies may play a role in the pathogenesis of IgAN. It has 
been shown previously that IgA1-containing immune complexes 
from patients with IgAN bind to mesangial cells with higher affin￾ity than does uncomplexed IgA1 (23) and that IgA1-IgG immune 
complexes stimulate proliferation of mesangial cells and increase 
secretion of cytokines/chemokines and extracellular matrix pro￾teins, mimicking the findings in IgAN renal biopsies (24, 25). 
Notably, uncomplexed Gal-deficient IgA1 does not seem to affect 
cellular proliferation (24, 25).

In an experimental rat model of IgAN, simultaneous administra￾tion of IgA and IgG has been shown to increase proteinuria via a 
complement-dependent mechanism (38). A pathogenic role of IgG 
in renal deposits is supported by the observation that mesangial 
IgG deposition in the presence of normal renal function is a risk 
factor for decreased renal survival in IgAN patients (39). In our 
patients who were sampled within 30 days of renal biopsy, there 
was, however, no apparent correlation between serum levels of IgG 
specific for Gal-deficient IgA1 and the quantity of glomerular IgG 
deposits as determined by renal pathologists.
We show that the glycan-specific IgG antibodies bind to Gal￾deficient IgA1 and form immune complexes, which is consistent 
with earlier reports (24, 25). It has been shown previously that 
these circulatory immune complexes are not effectively catabo￾lized by the liver and are deposited in the glomerular mesangial 
area due to their large size rather than through binding to an 
intrinsic glomerular antigen. Sedivá et al. (40) assessed the expres￾sion of carbohydrate-binding site(s) in the human kidney. The 
authors did not find GalNAc-containing epitopes in the mesan￾gium in any of the tested samples, suggesting that the glycan-spe￾cific IgG itself will not be directed to mesangium. Consequently, 
both Gal-deficient IgA1 and glycan-specific IgG are necessary for 
induction of IgAN. Direct evidence supporting the pathogenic 
role of IgA1-IgG immune complexes came from experiments using 
cultured human mesangial cells (24, 25). The results of our ongo￾ing studies suggest that anti-glycan IgG antibodies from IgAN 
patients, but not IgG from healthy controls without anti-glycan 
specificity, form IgA1-IgG complexes that stimulate proliferation 
of cultured human mesangial cells. Furthermore, Gal-deficient 
IgA1 or anti-glycan IgG alone does not exhibit these stimulatory 
activities (J. Novak et al., unpublished observations).
If the IgG does play a direct role in eliciting pathogenic changes 
in the mesangium, one would expect that IgG codeposits would be 
detectable in biopsy specimens. There are, however, considerable 
differences in the literature in terms of the estimated frequency 
and degree of IgG deposition in patients with IgAN, and in the 
clinic, it is not unusual for pathology reports to indicate that IgG 
deposition is absent or minimal. Reports in the literature regard￾ing the frequency and degree of IgG deposition in patients with 
IgAN are based on pathology reports, and these typically suggest 
the presence of IgG codeposits in about 60% of biopsies (41–43). It 
is possible therefore that the reported low frequencies reflect the 
relative insensitivity of the assays used in the clinical laboratories 
and the variability reflects the different protocols and/or antibod￾ies used for immunohistochemical analysis in different laborato￾ries. Our experience suggests that this may be the case, as confocal 
microscopic evaluation of biopsy specimens from 7 IgAN patients 
indicated that IgG could be detected by immunofluorescent stain￾ing in the glomeruli of the 6 specimens that contained glomeruli 
and that IgG-IgA complexes were detectable in the tubules of the 
specimen that did not contain glomeruli. In contrast, the patholo￾gy reports stated that although all of the samples had IgA, 2 of the 
samples had no IgG and 2 samples, only trace amounts. In the 3 
samples that were reported as being positive for IgG, the intensity 
was described as 1+. Thus, IgG codeposits are likely more frequent 
than reported in the literature or than would be expected based 
on pathology reports (L. Novak et al, unpublished observations). 
This observation, as well as the question as to whether the timing

Importance of the A to S substitution in YCAR/K sequence of CDR3 in the binding of IgG to Gal-deficient IgA1. (A) Western blot analysis using 
Gal-deficient IgA1 (Ale poly) as antigen demonstrated binding of rIgG cloned from an IgAN patient (subject 1123) but only marginal binding of 
rIgG from a healthy control (subject 9017). (B) The reduced Gal-deficient IgA1 (Mce1) (lane 1); enzymatically desialylated Gal-deficient IgA1 
(lane 2); and desialylated and degalactosylated Gal-deficient IgA1 (lane 3) were incubated with rIgG after SDS-PAGE/Western blotting. Removal 
of sialic acid and Gal in the IgA1 hinge region increased the binding, suggesting that the rIgG bound specifically to GalNAc. (C) The aa sequence 
(YCSK) in the CDR3 of VH of IgG from an IgAN patient (subject 1123) was reverted to the healthy control germline counterpart sequence (YCAK) 
using an overlap PCR strategy. Conversely, the CDR3 of IgG from a healthy control (subject 9017) was mutated to generate YCSR. (D) After 
the S to A substitution was introduced in CDR3 of VH of IgG of the cells from an IgAN patient (subject 1123), rIgG binding to Gal-deficient IgA1 
was reduced by 72%. Conversely, the A to S substitution in CDR3 of IgG of the cells from a healthy control (subject 9017) increased binding to 
Gal-deficient IgA1. Anti-human IgA (heavy-chain specific) Western blotting was used as load control. Results were evaluated densitometrically. 
Representative results from 2 experiments are shown in A–D; lanes were run on the same gel but were noncontiguous.

of the biopsy in terms of the state of disease progression affects the 
finding of IgG codeposits, requires further study.
Although the origin of the glycan-specific antibodies remains 
unclear, some viruses and bacteria express GalNAc-containing 
molecules on their surface structures (8). We speculate that in 
patients with IgAN, an infection with one of these microorganisms 
induces production of glycan-specific antibodies that cross-react 
with Gal-deficient IgA1. This hypothesis is supported by the clini￾cal observation that in patients with IgAN, urinary abnormalities 
are frequently exacerbated during upper–respiratory tract infec￾tions (synpharyngitic hematuria) (44). Furthermore, higher lev￾els of circulatory IgA1-containing immune complexes have been 
observed during episodes of increased clinical activity marked 
by macroscopic hematuria (7, 20, 24). While the IgG antibodies 
against Gal-deficient IgA1 appear to be predominantly glycan-spe￾cific, it is possible that serum polyclonal IgG may contain addi￾tional types of antibodies generated by the epitope-spreading pro￾cess described in many autoimmune diseases (45). Furthermore, 
we have reported previously that not only IgG but also IgA1 in the 
sera of IgAN patients can bind to Gal-deficient IgA1 (21). Future 
studies are needed, perhaps even using IgA1-secreting cell lines 
(19), to determine the role of IgA1 antibodies against Gal-deficient 
IgA1 in the pathology of IgAN and to investigate the possibility 
that such antibodies also may be aberrantly glycosylated.

Serum levels of IgG specific for Gal-deficient IgA1 are elevated in patients with IgAN. (A) Gal-deficient IgA1 (Ale) placed in 96-well plates with 
PVDF membranes was incubated with normalized concentrations of serum IgG from IgAN patients, disease controls, and healthy controls; a 
representative example from 3 experiments is shown (20 samples from each group). The rIgG from an IgAN patient served as a positive con￾trol. Serum IgG from IgAN patients bound more to Gal-deficient IgA1 compared with the IgG from disease controls or healthy controls. (B) The 
intensity of signal in each well was measured by densitometry; the intensity of rIgG bound to Gal-deficient IgA was assigned a value of 100%. 
Serum IgG from IgAN patients has significantly higher reactivity to Gal-deficient IgA1 compared with that from healthy (P < 0.0001) and disease 
controls (P < 0.0001). Serum IgG from 54 of the 60 patients with IgAN showed values greater than the 90th percentile of the values for healthy 
controls. Wilcoxon’s rank-sum test was used for 2-sample comparison. Data are shown as individual values and the mean ± SD. (C) ROC for

Analyses of the IGH gene sequences encoding antibodies specific 
for Gal-deficient IgA1 from IgAN patients indicated that these Ig
genes have been positively selected during active immune responses 
because all the VH gene sequences have mutations compared with 
the corresponding germline VH genes (46, 47). Although there is no 
specific selection of the VH, diversity region of the IGH gene (DH), 
or joint region of IGH gene (JH) gene usage, 6 of the 7 antibodies 
specific for Gal-deficient IgA1 share the same A to S substitution 
within the CDR3 of the IgH (CDR-H3) (the YCSR/K motif). Nor￾mally, the CDR-H3 is located in the center of the antigen-binding 
sites and is the main determinant of antibody specificity (48). The 
specific selection of the YCSR/K motif within these IgAN-specific 
antibodies suggests that this particular region is directly involved 
in binding Gal-deficient IgA1. Indeed, changing the S residue 
back to A residue dramatically reduced the capacity of the IgAN 
antibody (subject 1123) to bind the Gal-deficient IgA1; conversely, 
artificially changing the A to S in a control antibody (subject 9017) 
strongly enhanced its binding to the Gal-deficient IgA1. These 
results provide what we believe is the first information regarding 
the molecular signature of IgG specific for Gal-deficient IgA1 in 
IgAN patients. Currently, it is not known whether this change orig￾inated from genetic variation or somatic mutation during active 
immune response (49, 50). Further analysis of the generation and 
selection of antibodies with this signature during the course of 
IgAN will provide new insights into its pathogenesis.
Methods
Human subjects. Peripheral blood was collected from a total of 60 patients 
with biopsy-proven IgAN (mean age, 34.8 ± 12.5 years; serum creatinine, 
1.3 ± 0.6 mg/dl; UP/Cr ratio, 1.31 ± 1.60), from 40 healthy controls (mean 
age, 38.0 ± 16.2 years; serum creatinine, 0.9 ± 0.2 mg/dl; UP/Cr ratio, 
0.06 ± 0.06), and from 20 disease controls (patients with biopsy-proven 
lupus nephritis, membranous nephritis, and minimal change nephrotic 
syndrome; mean age, 35.0 ± 11.4 years; serum creatinine, 1.1 ± 0.4 mg/dl; 
UP/Cr ratio, 1.56 ± 1.93) (Supplemental Table 4). The IgAN patients 
included 16 white males and 9 white females, 1 African-American male 
and 2 African-American females, and 12 Japanese males and 20 Japanese 
females. The healthy control group consisted of 12 white males and 12 
white females, 2 African-American males and 4 African-American females, 
and 4 Japanese males and 6 Japanese females. All healthy controls had 
normal UP/Cr ratio or dipstick test for protein, and none exhibited micro￾scopic hematuria. Disease controls consisted of a group of 5 white males 
and 1 white female and 1 African-American female, and 7 Japanese males 
and 6 Japanese females. We determined the levels of IgA, Gal-deficient 
IgA1, and IgG in the serum samples from the 60 IgAN, 20 disease controls, 
and 40 healthy control subjects by capture ELISA. For 20 of 60 patients 
with IgAN, urine and blood samples were collected within 30 days of renal 
biopsy (contemporaneous samples). The Institutional Review Boards at 
the University of Alabama at Birmingham, the University of Tennessee 
Health Sciences Center, and Juntendo University School of Medicine 
approved this study. Written informed consent was obtained from all 
adults and from a parent or legally authorized representative for all chil￾dren; children age 8 years or older provided signed assent.
Isolation of PBMCs, transformation with EBV, and cloning of IgG-secreting cell 
lines. PBMCs from patients with IgAN and healthy controls were isolated 
from heparinized peripheral blood by Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient cen￾trifugation. The B cell fraction was enriched from the PBMCs by removal of 
adherent cells through incubation in a plastic tissue-culture flask for 1 hour 
at 37°C and removal of T cells by CD3 (PanT) Dynabeads, according to the 
manufacturer’s instructions (Dynal; Invitrogen). PBMCs from 16 randomly 
selected IgAN patients (10 white males and 6 white females; 13 subjects had 
proteinuria or microscopic hematuria at the time of study) and 16 random￾ly selected white healthy controls (6 white males and 10 white females) were 
then immortalized with EBV (19, 51) in the Center for Clinical and Transla￾tional Science of the University of Alabama at Birmingham. To establish cell 
lines from the initial EBV-immortalized PBMCs from patients with IgAN 
and healthy controls, we subcloned IgG-secreting cells by limiting dilution 
(using 96-well plates seeded with 5 to 10 cells per well) in RPMI 1640 sup￾plemented with l-glutamine, 20% FCS, penicillin, and streptomycin (19). 
After several rounds of cloning and screening, IgG-producing cell lines were 
generated from all 16 IgAN patients and all 16 healthy controls.
Measurement of Ig and immune-complex levels. The isotypes of the Igs secret￾ed by the immortalized cells were determined by capture ELISA (21, 31). 
ELISA plates were coated with 1 μg/ml of the F(ab′)2 fragment of goat IgG 
specific for human IgA, IgG, or IgM (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laborato￾ries Inc.). The captured Igs were then detected with a biotin-labeled F(ab′)2
fragment of goat IgG anti-human IgA, IgG, or IgM antibody (BioSource). 
Avidin–horseradish peroxidase conjugate (ExtrAvidin; Sigma-Aldrich) 
and the peroxidase chromogenic substrate o-phenylenediamine–H2O2
(Sigma-Aldrich) were then added. The color reaction was stopped with 
1 M sulfuric acid, and the absorbance at 490 nm was measured using an 
EL312 BioKinetics Microplate Reader (BioTek). Standard curves for Igs 
were generated from a pool of normal human sera calibrated for all Ig 
isotypes (Binding Site). The results were calculated using a DeltaSoft III 
computer program (BioMetallics). Urinary IgA-IgG immune complexes 
were measured using cross-capture ELISA (52).
Myeloma proteins. The IgA1 myeloma proteins that were isolated from 
plasma of patients with multiple myeloma are listed in Supplemental 
Table 1 together with their molecular characteristics (31). In brief, plasma 
samples were precipitated with ammonium sulfate (50% saturation). The 
precipitate was then dissolved in and dialyzed against 10 mM sodium 
phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) prior to fractionation by ion-exchange chroma￾tography on DEAE-cellulose, followed by affinity chromatography using 
Jacalin-agarose to capture IgA1 (Sigma-Aldrich) (21). The final purification 
step was size-exclusion chromatography on columns of Sephadex G-200 or 
Ultrogel AcA 22 (Amersham Biosciences). As the IgA myeloma proteins can 
be contaminated with IgG, the purified protein was subjected to affinity 
chromatography using staphylococcal protein G immobilized on agarose 
(Sigma-Aldrich). The purity of the IgA1 preparations was assessed by SDS￾PAGE and Western blotting using an IgA1-specific monoclonal antibody 
(21). The molecular form of the IgA1 proteins was assessed by size-exclu￾sion chromatography, SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions, and 
Western blots developed with anti-IgA antibody.
ELISA characterization of antigen-specific IgG antibodies. The binding of 
serum IgG from IgAN patients and healthy controls, as well as IgG secret￾ed by EBV-immortalized cells from the same subjects, was analyzed by 
ELISA using a panel of antigens: dd-IgA1, Fab-IgA1 generated using an 
IgA-specific protease from Haemophilus influenzae HK50, HR-BSA, and HR￾GalNAc-BSA. HR-GalNAc was synthesized by Bachem (asterisks mark the 
sites with GalNAc): V-P-S-T-P-P-*T-P-*S-P-*S-T-P-P-T-P-S-P-S- C-NH2. 
The hinge-region peptide was the same peptide but with no GalNAc. Both 
preparations were cross-linked to BSA.
For ELISA, flat-bottom 96-well plates (MaxiSorp; Nunc) were coated 
with 1 μg/ml solution of the above-mentioned antigens. Serum or culture 
supernatant samples diluted in PBS were added to each well. The amount 
of total IgG used for the analyses was normalized in all samples. The cap￾tured IgG were detected with a biotin-labeled F(ab′)2 fragment of goat IgG 
anti-human IgG antibody (BioSource; Invitrogen). Avidin–horseradish per￾oxidase conjugate (ExtrAvidin; Sigma-Aldrich) was then added, and the 
reaction was developed as described before (19).

SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Serum and culture supernatants were 
separated by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions using 4%–20% gradi￾ent slab gels (Bio-Rad). The amounts of protein loaded were adjusted to 
achieve equivalent amounts of IgA protein in each lane. The gels were blot￾ted onto PVDF membranes and incubated with antibody specific for IgA 
heavy chains (Vector Laboratories) or a biotin-labeled HAA lectin. HAA 
reacts with terminal GalNAc but not with sialylated GalNAc or GalNAc￾Gal disaccharide. Gal-deficient IgA1 myeloma proteins (Mce or Ale poly), 
after separation by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and electroblot￾ting onto PVDF membranes, served as antigens for analysis of glycan-spe￾cific IgG. The bound IgG was detected with IgG-specific antibody, and the 
visualization of positive bands was accomplished by subsequent incubation 
of the membrane with avidin-peroxidase conjugate, followed by enhanced 
chemiluminescence detection (Pierce; Thermo Scientific) (30–32).
HAA inhibition. To inhibit IgG binding to Gal-deficient IgA1 (Mce) myelo￾ma protein or HR-GalNAc-BSA, 20 μg/ml unlabeled HAA was applied to 
PVDF membrane after electroblotting of IgA1 or to the wells of ELISA 
plates after coating with IgA1 protein.
Immune-complex formation in vitro. IgG was isolated from cell-culture 
supernatants of the IgG-secreting cell lines derived from patients with 
IgAN and healthy controls by protein G affinity chromatography (GE 
Healthcare). These cell lines were subcloned by limiting dilution, and 
clones secreting glycan-specific IgG (binding to Gal-deficient IgA1) were 
selected. Immune complexes were formed in vitro by mixing 50 μg Gal￾deficient IgA1 (Ale mono) and 50 μg purified glycan-specific IgG and incu￾bating the mixture overnight at 4°C. The formed complexes were fraction￾ated by HPLC on a calibrated TSK 3000 column (Tosoh Bioscience), and 
0.25 ml fractions were analyzed for IgA1-IgG immune complexes using 
cross-capture ELISA (25).
Cloning of IGH, IGκ, and IGλ genes. Single-cell reverse-transcription PCR was 
used to amplify the V(D)J regions for IGH, IGκ, and IGλ genes (33). Reverse 
transcription and first-round PCR were performed with OneStep RT-PCR 
Kit (QIAGEN) under these conditions: 50°C, 30 minutes; 94°C, 15 minutes; 
94°C, 20 seconds; 55°C, 30 seconds; 72°C, 1 minute for 50 cycles; 72°C, 
10 minutes; and stop at 4°C. Second-round PCR was performed with rTaq 
DNA Polymerase (Invitrogen) under these conditions: 94°C, 3 minutes; 
94°C, 20 seconds; 57°C (IgH/Igκ) or 60°C (Igλ), 30 seconds; 72°C, 45 sec￾onds for 50 cycles; 72°C, 5 minutes; and stop at 4°C. One microliter of cDNA 
from first-round PCR was used as the template for the second-round PCR. 
The average single-cell RT-PCR efficiency was 38.4%. Positive PCR products 
were purified (QIAquick; QIAGEN) and sequenced. The resultant Ig gene 
sequences were analyzed with the IgBLAST program to determine the poten￾tial VH, DH, and JH germline gene usage and mutation analysis (http://www.
ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/igblast/). Restriction enzyme digestion sites were intro￾duced in the second round of single-cell RT-PCR. Digested IgH, Igκ, and Igλ
PCR products were purified using QIAquick PCR purification kit (QIAGEN) 
and directly cloned into specific expression vectors containing human Igγ1, 
Igκ, or Igλ constant regions. Plasmids were sequenced to confirm clones 
with inserts identical to that of the original PCR products. The pI values and 
CDR3 junction analysis were determined by IMGT/V-QUEST (http://www.
imgt.org/IMGT_vquest/vquest). The corresponding DNA sequences were 
deposited to GenBank (accession numbers FJ746335–FJ746360).
VH CDR3 site-specific mutagenesis. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed 
by 2-step PCR to generate amplicons with mutated (IgAN patient 1123) 
or unmutated (healthy control 9017) VH genes (34). Primers used in PCR 
reverted the substitution (S to A) in the IgAN clone or mutated (A to S) 
the sequence in the clone from the healthy control (Supplemental Table 
3). The first PCR (PCR1) forward primer was VH specific and contained 
an AgeI restriction site. The PCR2 reverse primer was JH specific and con￾tained the SalI restriction site. PCR products 1 and 2 were hybridized via 
the homologous region in the subsequent overlap PCR using the same 5′-
AgeI VH-specific forward primer and the 3′ SalI JH-specific reverse primer 
and generated the complete VDJ sequence with desired mutations. Corre￾sponding clones were sequenced and cloned into the IgG expression vector 
for production of rIgG.
rIgG antibody production. Human embryonic kidney cells (293H) were 
cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS (Ultra Low Bovine Ig 
content; Gibco, Invitrogen) and cotransfected with 10 μg plasmid DNA 
constructs encoding IgH and IgL chains by polyethyleneimine (Sigma￾Aldrich) precipitation. After 16-hour transfection, the cell-culture medium 
was replaced with fresh medium. Supernatants with secreted IgG were col￾lected after 7 days.
Fab purification of rIgG. The Fab fragment of rIgG from an IgAN patient 
was purified using the Pierce Fab Preparation Kit (Thermo Scientific).
Dot-blot analysis. Gal-deficient IgA1 (Ale poly; 0.5 μg per well) was placed 
into the wells of a 96-well plate with PVDF membrane (MultiScreenHTS IP 
Filer Plate; Millipore) and blocked with SuperBlock (Pierce; Thermo Scien￾tific). Serum or cell-culture supernatants (normalized to 0.5 μg IgG in each 
sample) were added and incubated overnight at 4°C. As a positive control, 
0.5 μg of rIgG from an IgAN patient was used. The binding was detected with 
IgG-specific antibody, followed by subsequent incubation of the membrane 
with avidin-peroxidase conjugate, and the reaction was visualized using 
enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce; Thermo Scientific), as described above 
for Western blotting. Results were evaluated densitometrically. The intensity 
of rIgG binding to Gal-deficient IgA was assigned a value of 100%.
Statistics. Correlations between different parameters were analyzed by 
2-tailed Student’s t test or by regression analysis. ANOVA was used to 
determine differences in the characteristics among multiple groups. Non￾parametric methods, such as Spearman’s rank correlation and Wilcoxon’s 
rank-sum test were used for the correlation and 2-sample comparisons, 
respectively. Data were expressed as mean ± SD or median values. P < 0.05 
was considered significant. These statistical analyses were performed with 
StatView 5.0 software (Abacus Concepts). The ROC for Gal-deficient IgA1-
specific IgG levels in patients and controls was constructed using Graph￾Pad Prism, version 4.00 for Windows (GraphPad Software).
