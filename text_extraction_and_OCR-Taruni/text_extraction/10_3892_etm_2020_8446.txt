Abstract. Erythroid parameters have been indicated to 
be important prognostic factors for liver diseases. The 
present study aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of the 
erythrocyte count in Chinese patients with primary biliary 
cholangitis (PBC) and develop a prognostic model. The 
clinical data of 301 patients with PBC were retrospectively 
reviewed. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression 
analysis was performed to identify potential prognostic risk 
factors. Bivariate correlation analysis was used to determine 
the correlation coefficient of the erythrocyte count and 
biochemical indices. The prognostic values of different factors 
were compared by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) 
curve analysis. A novel prognostic model was constructed 
using multivariate logistic regression. Multivariate regression 
analysis suggested that the erythrocyte count was an indepen￾dent risk factor/prognostic index (P=0.042). The erythrocyte 
count in peripheral blood decreased as the histological stage 
progressed (P<0.001). The erythrocyte count was correlated 
with albumin, liver stiffness and Fibrosis‑4. Compared with 
that of platelets, the area under the ROC curve of the erythrocyte 
count was significantly greater. A similar area under the ROC 
curve was determined for the erythrocyte count, albumin and 
total bilirubin (P>0.05). A novel prognostic model was estab￾lished as follows: P=1/{1 + e‑[6.140‑3.193 x Ln(erythrocyte 
count) ‑0.184 x albumin + 0.827 x Ln(total bilirubin)]}. The 
novel model had a comparable prognostic value to that of 
the GLOBE score and UK‑PBC risk score, and had a better 
performance than the Mayo risk score at baseline (0.838 vs. 
0.787). In conclusion, the erythrocyte count is an independent 
risk factor/prognostic index in Chinese patients with PBC. 
It was correlated with liver function and fibrosis in Chinese 
patients. The novel model incorporating the erythrocyte count 
and biochemical indices at baseline may serve as a prognostic 
tool in Chinese patients with PBC (Trial registration number, 
ChiCTR‑ONRC‑10002070; date of registration, 2010‑05‑10).
Introduction
Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is a chronic and progressive 
immune‑mediated cholestatic liver disease (1). The survival 
periods of patients with PBC vary. For patients diagnosed 
at the early stage, the survival periods are similar to those 
of healthy individuals after ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) 
treatment (2). The median survival time is 6‑10 years for 
patients with advanced PBC (3). According to clinical practice 
guidelines, risk stratification has a vital role in the clinical 
management of patients with PBC (4). For risk stratification 
of patients with PBC, it is required to assess the probability of 
adverse events and perform a prediction of the prognosis prior 
to treatment. In order to predict the survival of patients with 
PBC, several prognostic models based on clinical parameters 
have been developed, including the GLOBE score, UK‑PBC 
risk score and Mayo risk score (5‑8).
All of the continuous scoring systems mentioned above 
have been widely used for prognostic evaluation in patients 
with PBC. Furthermore, several studies were performed to 
explore novel prognostic indices or models (5,7). Their results 
suggested that existing prognostic models of PBC may be 
improved by taking other variables into account. In previous 
years, erythroid‑associated parameters have been indicated to 
be linked to liver‑associated diseases (9,10). A previous study 
has reported that the erythrocyte count in peripheral blood 
Erythrocyte count is associated with prognosis in 
Chinese patients with primary biliary cholangitis

2076 CHANG et al: PROGNOSTIC VALUE OF ERYTHROCYTE IN PBC
was associated with survival after surgery in patients with 
primary liver cancer (11). Several other studies have reported 
that the red blood cell distribution width (RDW) may serve 
as a predictive index for histological severity and a potential 
prognostic indicator of chronic liver diseases (12-14). While 
the mechanism underlying the clinical relevance of erythro￾cytes in PBC remains elusive, previous studies have indicated 
that erythroid parameters, including the erythrocyte count, are 
potential prognostic indicators for PBC (12,13).
In the present study, the prognostic value of the erythrocyte 
count in Chinese patients with PBC was analyzed. Correlations 
of the erythrocyte count with liver-associated indices were 
investigated. Furthermore, a novel predictive model for 
the prognosis of PBC was developed by incorporating the 
erythrocyte count and other biochemical indices.
Patients and methods
Patients. The present study was approved by the Ethics 
Committee of Xijing Hospital (Xi'an, China) and all patients 
had signed an informed consent form. The present study 
was performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. 
The present study retrospectively enrolled 301 patients 
with PBC who received treatment at the Department of 
Gastroenterology at Xijing Hospital (Xi'an, China) from March 
2006 to August 2018. Initiation of UDCA treatment was 
between March 2006 and January 2017. The inclusion criteria 
were as follows: i) Patients diagnosed with PBC meeting at 
least two of the following criteria: Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) 
>2-fold of the upper limit normal (ULN) or gamma-glutamyl 
transpeptidase (GGT) >5-fold of the ULN, titer of anti-mito￾chondrial antibody >1:40 and liver biopsy exhibiting fl orid bile 
duct lesions; ii) UDCA treatment was initiated and maintained 
for at least 12 months at the dosage of 13-15 mg/kg/day after 
diagnosis of PBC. The exclusion criteria were as follows: 
i) Concurrence of other liver diseases, including viral hepatitis, 
primary sclerosing cholangitis, autoimmune hepatitis, alcoholic 
liver disease, hemochromatosis, Wilson's disease or non-alco￾holic steatohepatitis; ii) baseline clinical data were incomplete; 
iii) for patients with transplant-free survival, the duration of 
follow-up was <1 year. All patients had been followed up at 
intervals of 1-6 months during UDCA treatment. The ULN of 
ALP was 150 U/l and the ULN of GGT was 50 U/l.
Study design. Clinical data were retrieved from the patients' 
records at baseline and after 1 year of treatment. The data 
included the erythrocyte count, haemoglobin (HGB), hema￾tocrit (HCT), erythrocyte mean corpuscular volume (MCV), 
age, sex, platelets (PLT), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), 
aspartate aminotransferase (AST), albumin (ALB), globulin 
(GLB), total bilirubin (TBIL), ALP, GGT, cholesterol, triglyc￾eride (TG), creatinine (CRE), prothrombin time (PT), activated 
partial thromboplastin time (APTT), fi brinogen and thrombin 
time. Other demographic indices, including body mass index 
and status of smoking and drinking, were not included in the 
analysis, as they were not available. The GLOBE score and 
UK-PBC risk score were calculated after 1 year of treatment 
and the Mayo risk score was determined at baseline. Liver 
stiffness (LS) (15) and Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) (16) were recorded 
at baseline and taken as indicators of liver fi brosis. LS was 
detected by transient elastography with FibroTouch (Wuxi 
Hisky Medical Technology Co., Ltd.). According to the 
formula in the Formulae of predictive models section below, 
the FIB-4 score was determined from four baseline vari￾ables, including age, AST, ALT and PLT. Pathological stages 
were classifi ed according to Ludwig's classifi cation (17) and 
presented as categorical data. The end‑points were defi ned as 
liver transplantation or death.
Histological analysis. Liver biopsies were analyzed by two 
experienced hepatic pathologists (Professor Zengshan Li 
and Dr Lin Chen, Department of Pathology, Xijing Hospital, 
Fourth Military Medical University). Histological features 
were recorded as stage 1 (portal stage), stage 2 (periportal 
stage), stage 3 (septal stage) and stage 4 (cirrhosis) (17,18), 
according to Ludwig's classifi cation.
Statistical analysis. Continuous variables with a normal distri￾bution are expressed as the mean ± standard deviation, while 
variables with a non-normal distribution are presented as the 
median (lower quartile-upper quartile). Shapiro-Wilk test was 
applied to assess normality of distribution. Categorical vari￾ables were expressed as n (%). For comparison of categorical 
data, Fisher's exact test was performed. The Kruskal-Wallis 
H-test and Mann-Whitney U-test with Bonferroni correction 
were used for continuous values with a non-normal distri￾bution. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs of biochemical 
parameters were calculated using the Cox regression model 
in univariate and multivariate analyses. Bivariate correlation 
analysis was applied to determine correlations between eryth￾rocyte count and liver-associated parameters and Spearman 
correlation coefficients were obtained. Receiver operating 
characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was utilized for evaluating 
the prognostic value of biochemical parameters and predic￾tive models. Comparisons of areas under receiver operating 
characteristic curve (AUCs) of biochemical parameters and 
predictive models were accomplished by the Delong-Delong 
non-parametric method. Based on binary multivariate logistic 
regression analysis, a predictive model was constructed for 
estimating the prognosis at baseline. The Hosmer-Lemeshow 
test was applied to test for the goodness of fi t of the predictive 
model. Analyses were accomplished using SPSS 19.0 (IBM 
Corp.), except for the comparisons of AUCs, which were 
performed with MedCalc Statistical Software version 15.2.2 
(MedCalc Software bvba). The P-values were two-sided and 
P<0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically signifi cant 
difference.

Results
Patient characteristics. The demographic and clinical data 
of the present cohort are provided in Table I. A total of 301 
Chinese patients with PBC were retrospectively reviewed, 
including 258 (85.7%) females and 43 (14.3%) males. The 
average age of the patients at baseline was 51.89 years. 
The median follow‑up time was 44 months. Furthermore, 
41 patients (13.6%) underwent liver transplantation or died 
during the follow‑up.
Prognostic factors of survival by univariate and multivariate 
regression analysis. According to the univariate Cox regres￾sion analysis, the baseline erythrocyte count, MCV, HGB, 
HCT, age, PLT, AST, ALB, GLB, TBIL, CRE, PT and APTT 
were associated with patient survival. A multivariate analysis 
was then performed for each of these baseline factors. The 
results indicated that only the erythrocyte count (P=0.042, 
HR: 0.524, 95%CI: 0.281‑0.976), ALB (P<0.001, HR: 0.844, 
95%CI: 0.792‑0.900) and TBIL (P<0.001, HR: 1.008, 95%CI: 
1.005‑1.012) at baseline were independent risk factors and 
associated with patient prognosis (Table II).

erythrocyte count and other baseline biochemical indices 
(Table SI). Close correlations were identified between the 
erythrocyte count and other parameters, including the PLT, 
ALB and TBIL (P<0.001). A positive correlation of the 
erythrocyte count with ALB (r=0.555) and PLT (r=0.329) 
was determined, as well as a negative correlation with TBIL 
(r=‑0.406). The correlations between the erythrocyte count 
and hepatic fibrosis parameters were investigated to verify 
whether the erythrocyte count in the peripheral blood was 
associated with the progression of PBC. The erythrocyte 
count decreased as the pathological stage increased (P<0.001; 
Fig. 1; Table SII). There was a negative correlation between 
the erythrocyte count and the pathological stage (r=‑0.410, 
P<0.001; Fig. S1). Furthermore, a bivariate correlation 
analysis was performed, suggesting that the erythrocyte count 
was closely linearly correlated to LS (r=‑0.581, P=0.003) and 
FIB‑4 (r=‑0.482, P<0.001), indicating that the erythrocyte 
count was associated with the progression of cirrhosis in 
Chinese patients with PBC (Fig. 2).
Predictive performance of erythroid parameters for patient 
prognosis. The prognostic value of various biochemical indices 
was determined using ROC curve analysis at baseline and at 
the one‑year follow‑up. At baseline, the erythrocyte count had 
a significantly higher AUC value than HGB (0.822 vs. 0.762, 
P<0.001), HCT (0.822 vs. 0.782, P=0.002) and PLT (0.822 vs. 
0.654, P=0.003; Fig. 3A). After UDCA treatment for one year, 
the erythrocyte count still had a significantly higher AUC 
value than PLT (0.821 vs. 0.676, P=0.006; Fig. 3B; Table III). 
The AUC of the erythrocyte count was comparable to that 
of ALB and TBIL (P>0.05) at baseline and at the one‑year 
follow‑up (Table SIII).

Derivation of predictive model for prognosis. Multivariate logistic 
regression analysis was performed on potential prognostic risk 
factors to construct a predictive model. Only variables identified 
in the multivariate Cox regression were included in the model. 
Ln transformations were applied for erythrocyte count and TBIL. 
The predictive model was constructed as follows:
P=1/{1 + e‑[6.140‑3.193 x Ln(erythrocyte count) ‑0.184 x ALB + 0.827 x LnTBIL]}.
Regarding goodness of fit, the result of the Hosmer‑​
Lemeshow test was P=0.454. Subsequently, the performance 
of the novel predictive model was compared using the GLOBE 
score, UK‑PBC risk score and Mayo risk score. At baseline, 
the novel model had a greater AUC value than the Mayo risk 
score (0.838 vs. 0.787), while the novel model had a similar 
AUC value compared with the GLOBE score and the UK‑PBC 
risk score (P>0.05; Fig. 4; Table IV; Table SIV). The sensitivity 
and specificity of the predictive model were 80.0 and 85.1% for 
predicting transplant‑free survival according to the maximum 
Youden index.

studies with limited patients indicated a potential prognostic 
value of erythroid parameters in patients with PBC (12,13). 
The decrease in erythrocyte count may be attributed to several 
aspects. As a common reason for the decrease of the erythocyte 
count, hemolysis presents in up to 50% of patients with chronic 
liver disease regardless of etiologies (19). Complications of 
cirrhosis, including splenomegaly, are the major reasons for 
hemolysis in patients with end‑stage disease. Alterations of 
the lipid composition, which were detected in the erythrocyte 
membrane of patients with liver diseases, have been associated 
with liver damage (20,21). The erythrocyte count in peripheral 
blood may be associated with chronic hepatic injury due to 
the impairment of the erythrocyte membrane structure caused 
by alteration of the lipid composition. Furthermore, certain 
studies suggested that the deficiency of hematopoietic precur￾sors due to immune injury of the hematopoietic system was 
also linked to a reduced erythrocyte count in patients with 
PBC (22,23). Other causes of erythrocyte deficiency included 
malnutrition, iron deficiency, bone marrow depression, 
cirrhosis and medications (22,24).
Splenomegaly is a cause of decreased erythrocyte count 
in patients with end‑stage PBC and it is considered to be 
linked to poor prognosis. However, in the present study, sple￾nomegaly was not subjected to multivariate Cox regression 
analysis, as the results of the imaging examination at baseline 
were not available for all patients. The relevance of spleno￾megaly regarding the prognostic value of the erythrocyte

count requires to be clarified. The mechanisms underlying 
the correlations between erythrocytes and liver fibrosis or 
dysfunction in patients with PBC also require to be further 
clarified. In the present study, a close correlation between 
erythrocyte count and liver function parameters, including 
ALB and TBIL, was identified. Furthermore, the erythrocyte 
count decreased as the pathological stage and liver fibrosis 
progressed. The increase in erythrocyte count after UDCA 
treatment was accompanied by the improvement of liver func￾tion and liver fibrosis score. Therefore, the decrease of the 
erythrocyte count may reflect the severity of liver disease and 
the extent of liver function deficiency in patients with PBC, 
which is in accordance with a previous study in patients with 
primary liver cancer (11).
Early prognostic models are important for risk stratifica￾tion for patients with PBC. In the present study, the prognostic 
value of the erythrocyte count was investigated as a simple, 
routinely tested parameter in Chinese patients with PBC. 
The novel predictive model incorporating the erythrocyte 
count had a better prognostic performance than the Mayo risk 
score, one of the most widely used prognostic systems (25), 
and was comparable with the GLOBE score and UK‑PBC 
risk score in the evaluation of the prognosis regarding trans￾plant‑free survival. The GLOBE score and UK‑PBC risk score 
involve parameters after one year of UDCA treatment. The 
novel model included only parameters at baseline, which may 
be helpful for early prognosis evaluation prior to initiation of 
UDCA treatment.
The present study has certain limitations. First, the present 
study was a retrospective study performed in only one clinical 
center. More prospective studies are required to confirm 
the results of the present study. Furthermore, no validation 
of the novel model was performed in another PBC cohort. 
The present cohort was only comprised of Chinese patients 
with PBC from one hospital. Although the sample size of 
the cohort was relatively big, it is still required to validate 
the prognostic model in other cohorts in China and other 
populations. Furthermore, RDW has been reported to be of 
prognostic value in PBC patients. RDW data were missing 
from the clinical data of the present cohort, making it impos￾sible to verify the results of previous studies and to determine 
whether RDW is a surrogate parameter for the erythrocyte 
count in the prognosis of PBC.
In conclusion, the present study indicated that the eryth￾rocyte count is a useful prognostic parameter in Chinese 
patients with PBC. The peripheral blood erythrocyte count 
was closely correlated with liver dysfunction and fibrosis. The 
model incorporating the erythrocyte count, ALB and TBIL 
may serve as an early prognostic tool for PBC.
