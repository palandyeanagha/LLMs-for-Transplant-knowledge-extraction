Abstract
LKM-1 autoantibodies, which are associated with autoimmune
chronic active hepatitis, recognize P4501ID6, a cytochrome
P450 monooxygenase. The reactivities of 26 LKM-1 antisera
were tested with a panel of deletion mutants of P4501ID6 ex￾pressed in Escherichia coli. 22 sera recognize a 33-amino acid
segment of P4501ID6, and 11 of these recognize a shorter seg￾ment, DPAQPPRD. PAQPPR is also found in IE175 of herpes
simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1). Antibodies for HSV-1 proteins
were detected by ELISA in 17 of 20 LKM-1 sera tested. An
immobilized, synthetic peptide, DPAQPPRDC, was used to
purify LKM-1 antibodies. Affinity purified LKM-1 autoanti￾bodies react on immunoblots with a protein in BHK cells after
infection with HSV-1. 11 of 24 LKM-1 sera, including 3 that
recognize DPAQPPRD, also exhibit antibodies to the hepatitis
C virus (HCV) protein, C100-3. Affinity purified LKM-1 anti￾bodies did not recognize C100-3. However, partial sequence
identity was evident between portions of the immunopositive
33-amino acid segment of P4501116 and other portions of the
putative HCV polyprotein. Immune cross-recognition of
P450IID6 and HCV or HSV-1 proteins may contribute to the
occurrence of LKM-1 autoantibodies. (J. Clin. Invest. 1991.

Introduction
LKM-1 autoantibodies are found in a subgroup of patients
with idiopathic autoimmune chronic hepatitis (1). These anti￾bodies recognize P450IID6, a cytochrome P-450 monooxygen￾ase, as judged by their recognition of the protein expressed
from cDNAs as a fusion protein (3, 4) and by the capacity of
the antibodies to inhibit reactions catalyzed by P4501ID6 (5).
P4501ID6 is associated with the metabolism of debrisoquine

and other antihypertensive drugs, and defective alleles of the
gene encoding P4501ID6 occur frequently leading to deficien￾cies in the metabolism of these compounds in roughly 5-10%
ofCaucasians (6). Competitive binding assays described in ear￾lier studies indicated that LKM-1 antibodies from different
patients bound to overlapping epitopes on P450IID6 (7). These
antibodies recognize both the native enzyme in microsomes as
well as the denatured protein in immunoblots, and the latter
suggested that these antibodies might recognize a linear seg￾ment of the protein.
The present study was undertaken to determine whether
these antibodies recognize a linear segment ofP450IID6 and to
characterize the location and sequence of the immunoreactive
segment. We reasoned that this effort would confirm the unifor￾mity of LKM-I autoreactivity as well as identify other proteins
exhibiting similar amino acid sequences that might also react
with these antisera. In addition, the identification ofan epitope
recognized by these inhibitory antibodies could provide addi￾tional information regarding the topology of P450 proteins.
We report here the identification of a short segment of
P450IID6 that is recognized by almost all LKM-1 autoanti￾bodies.
Methods
Patient sera. 26 LKM-1 positive sera from patients with hepatitis B
surface antigen-negative chronic active hepatitis were the focus of this
study. These sera were classified as LKM-12 positive because of their
reactivity by indirect immunofluorescence on rodent liver and kidney
tissue sections as well as by positive immunoblots of human liver mi￾crosomes and human recombinant LKM-1 (P4501ID6) antigen (3). As
controls, we used sera from nine patients with primary biliary cirrhosis
which were positive for anti-mitochondrial antibodies and sera from
six healthy controls without evidence of liver disease.
Construction ofdeletion mutants. The HLD8.2 cDNA (3) was in￾serted into the EcoRI site ofpBluescript KS- (Stratagene, Inc., La Jolla,
CA). The construct was digested with Clal, and the overhangs were
filled-in using Klenow fragment, in order to place the insert in proper
reading frame. Transformants ofDH5a cells (Bethesda Research Labo￾ratories, Gaithersburg, MD) harboring this construct expressed a pro￾tein which reacted strongly with an LKM-1 positive serum using the
immunoscreening procedure described by Helfman et al. (8). Sequence
analysis confirmed that the orientation of the insert was correct and
that the reading frame of the insert extended that of ,B-galactosidase.
Initial mutants were made by deleting a 3' segment or an internal
portion of the coding sequence using the restriction enzymes shown in
the legend to Fig. 1. In other cases, an internal restriction fragment was
excised and inserted into pBluescript KS- or SK-. For this purpose,

FsPI-STYI al. (9). The cDNA was inserted into
AocI-AocI pBluescript KS- (Stratagene, Inc.) and expressed as a fuision protein
PvuII-AocI with P-galactosidase. Deletions were
PvuII-STYI made using the indicated restriction

which were confirmed by sequence

expression as fusion proteins with
336-amino acid amino-terminal segments of anthranilate synthetase in E. coli. The amino acid sequences of P4501ID6 encoded by these con￾structs are shown. These were analyzed by immunoblotting as shown in Fig. 2.
blunt-ended sites in the polylinker and cDNA were used or created by
filling in 5' or making flush 3' overhangs at the selected site using
Klenow fragment or T4-DNA polymerase (U.S. Biochemical Corp.,
Cleveland, OH) respectively. The 5' junction of the insert and poly￾linker region were sequenced to confirm orientation and reading
frame.
Construction ofa synthetic cDNA encoding the epitope. The follow￾ing two oligonucleotides and their complements were synthesized and
kindly provided by Dr. C. Glass, The Scripps Institute:
5'-AATTCTGTTAACTGAGCACAGGATGACCTGGGATCCAGC
CCAGCCCCCCCGAGATCTGACTGAGGCCTTCCTGGCA-3'
and
5'-AGGCCTTCCTGGCAGAGATGGAGAAGGCCAAGGGGAAC
TGA-3'.
These oligonucleotides were designed to encode almost all ofthe short￾est immunopositive P450IID6/fl-galactosidase construct as two over￾lapping segments, and silent substitutions were incorporated (under.
lined nucleotides) to provide new restriction sites for additional dele￾tion analysis. Equimolar amounts of each oligonucleotide were mixed
in ligase buffer (Bethesda Research Laboratories), heated to 100IC for
5 min, and then allowed to cool slowly to room temperature. The
resulting double-stranded cDNA was inserted between the EcoRI and
HindIII sites of pATH I (T. J. Koerner, Duke University). The se￾quence of the cloned construct was determined in pATH from the 3'
end using a pBR EcoRI primer (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) as
well as following cloning ofthe insert into pBluescript SK-. Subsequent
deletions were made in the pBluescript construct and confirmed by
sequence analysis before being transferred to either pATH 1 or pATH
10. These pATH constructs were also verified by sequencing.
The resulting pATH constructs were transformed into SCS- I cells
(Stratagene, Inc.). The cells were cultured and processed for immuno￾blot analysis as described previously (10). Polyacrylamide gel electro￾phoresis employed a discontinuous buffer system containing sodium
dodecyl sulfate (SDS) (1 1). The concentration ofmonomer is stated in
the figure legends. After electrophoresis the protein content ofthe gels
was transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose (12). The nitrocel￾lulose filters were probed with antibody as described previously (3), and
bound antibodies were detected as described in the legends to figures.
Affinity purification ofLKM-1 antibody. The peptide, DPAQPPRDC,
and the control peptide IQEEAQCLVEER were synthesized and
kindly provided by Dr. Richard Houghten of this institution. The first
peptide contains an added carboxyl-terminal cysteine residue for im￾mobilization ofthe peptide to Thiopropyl-Sepharose (Sigma Chemical
Co., St. Louis, MO) as described by Parekh et al. (13). Purification of
the antibody followed that outlined by the latter authors. Briefly, 100 MAl
of antiserum was incubated with 50.IAI of packed resin for 4 h at room
temperature with occasional mixing. The unbound material was recov￾ered for later use. The resin was washed five times with 1 ml of 0.0IM
NaPi, pH 7.4, containing 0.1 SM NaCl (PBS). The antibody was eluted
in 1 ml of 0.IM citrate buffer containing 0.15M NaCl at pH 3.0 and
after removal of the Sepharose, the solution was immediately neutral￾ized by the addition of 150 IAl of 2 M Tris buffer, pH 8.0. The resulting
affinity purified antibody was diluted in PBS or 3% bovine serum albu￾min (BSA) in PBS for use in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays
(ELISA) and immunoblotting respectively. The reactivity ofthe affin￾ity-purified antibody with the fusion protein containing the segment of
P4501ID6 encoded by the Pvull-StyI fragment and native microsomal
P450IID6 was confirmed by immunoblotting.
ELISA. The wells of a 96-well polystyrene plate, Immulon II
(NUNC, Copenhagen) were coated with 50 Ml of human liver micro￾somes, 0.26 mg/ml, in 50 mM KP1, pH 7.4, containing 20% glycerol
and 1 mMEDTA. After overnight incubation at 4VC, the excess micro￾somal suspension was removed and residual binding sites were blocked
by incubation with 3% BSA in PBS. Serial dilutions (50 Ml) of samples
containing antibodies were incubated in the wells ofthe plate for 2 h at
370C. After extensive washes with PBS, a goat anti-human IgG alka￾line phosphatase conjugate (Sigma Chemical Co.) was added to each
LKM-I Autoantibody Epitope 1371

well (50 ,gl, 1:700 in PBS containing 3% BSA) for 1 h at 370C. Substrate
104 (Sigma Chemical Co.) was used for color development according
to the supplier's directions. Absorbance at 405 nm was determined.
Antibodies to the C100-3 protein encoded by hepatitis C virus (HCV)
were detected by an ELISA (14) from Ortho Diagnostics Raritan, NJ.
Positive ELISA results were confirmed by the recombinant immuno￾blot assay (Chiron Corp., Emeryville, CA) test based on recombinant
HCV proteins C100-3 and 5-1-1, as well as a control for reactivity with
the fusion partner, superoxide dismutase, used for expression of the
recombinant HCV proteins. Serum antibodies to herpes simplex virus
type 1 (HSV-1) were detected using an ELISA from Behringwerke,
Marburg, Federal Republic of Germany.
Competitive radioimmunoassay (RIA). This assay has been de￾scribed previously (7). Briefly, IgG was purified from the serum of a
patient, R.H., used to identify the short epitope, DPAQPPRD. 75 ,d of
the purified IgG (0.2 mg protein/ml in PBS) was used to coat assay
tubes (M 174, Dynatech, Deutschland GmbH, Plochingen, FRG) for 3
h at 250C, the tubes were then washed with PBS, and remaining bind￾ing sites were blocked with 200 ,l of 0.1% BSA/PBS overnight at 4VC.
Human liver microsomes (50 Ml at a concentration of 0.9 mg protein/
ml) were incubated in each tube for 3 h at 250C. Microsomes not
bound by the antibody were removed by washing with PBS. The detec￾tion of competing autoantibodies in sera from other patients followed
the blocking principle, i.e., 50 Ml of test serum, diluted in PBS, were
added to test tubes for 3 h at 250C before the addition of 50 Ml of the
purified IgG (300,000 cpm), which was allowed to react for 3 h at 250C.
Patient R.H. IgG was labeled with 125I by the chloramine-T method
(15). After washing, the amount of labeled antibody which bound to
the microsomes was determined. Each assay was done in duplicate, and
the results represent the mean of two independent experiments. The
method of analysis and additional details are provided in the legend to
Fig. 3 and in the text. The interassay coefficient of variation ranged
from 3.4% to 12.4% and the intra-assay coefficient of variation was
between 2.0% and 15.6%.
Infection ofcultured cells with HSV-1. Lysates from BHK cells in￾fected with HSV- I and from noninfected BHK cells were kindly pro￾vided by Dr. M. Lbhr of the University of Erlangen, FRG. Briefly,
BHK cells at a density of 3 x 10' cells per flask were infected with
HSV-l at a multiplicity of infection of 1. After overnight growth, the
cells were harvested and washed in PBS. Washed cells were suspended
in 100 jul of PBS per flask containing detergent and sonicated three
times for 30 s to produce the whole-cell lysate used for electrophoresis.
Sequence analysis. Computer assisted analysis ofDNA and protein
sequences were performed using the GCG Sequence Analysis Software
SDS PAGE >
(Genetics Computer Group, Inc., Madison, WI) (16). The NBRF pro￾tein (September 1990 release) and Genbank/EMBL (December 1990
release) databases were queried using FASTA and TFASTA, respec￾tively.
Results
Epitope mapping. In order to determine whether a single seg￾ment of the primary structure of human P45011D6 is recog￾nized by LKM-I antibodies, a panel of deletion mutants (Fig.
1), was constructed from the cDNA HLD8.2 (3) in pBluescript
and subsequently expressed in Escherichia coli as fusion pro￾teins with f,-galactosidase. Earlier work had demonstrated that
LKM-1 antibodies recognize the protein encoded by the
HLD8.2 cDNA, which encodes all but the first 124 amino acid
residues ofP450IID6, when this cDNA is inserted into the pBS
or pATH plasmids, and the protein is expressed in E. coli fused
with a portion of either fl-galactosidase or anthranilate synthe￾tase, respectively (3). Colony lysates from the deletion panel in
pBluescript were immobilized on nitrocellulose filters and
probed with LKM-1 sera and '25I-Protein A using the colony￾screening procedure of Helfman et al. (8). These experiments
indicated that the majority of LKM-1 sera bind to a fusion
protein in lysates of E. coli, which contained a plasmid encod￾ing the PvuII-StyI fragment corresponding to nucleotides 751-
850 ofthe HLD8.2 cDNA (3). A consistent pattern ofreactivity
was seen for overlapping constructs, and constructs encoding
other segments of the protein were negative (Fig. 1).
In order to refine the localization of the epitope within the
segment encoded by the PvuII-StyI fragment, two overlapping
sets of complementary oligonucleotides were synthesized
corresponding to this fragment. These contained additional re￾striction sites resulting from silent substitutions that facilitated
the construction of further deletions from either end of the
synthetic portion. The fragments produced in this manner (Fig.
1), as well as the PvuII-StyI fragment derived from the cDNA,
were then inserted into pATH vectors for expression as fusion
proteins with anthranilate synthetase. The resulting fusion pro￾teins were examined in immunoblotting experiments employ￾ing LKM-1 antibodies and lysates ofthe transformed E. coli, as
is shown for one serum in Fig. 2.

These experiments confirmed and extended the results
seen earlier with the constructions in pBluescript. Of 26 LKM￾1-positive sera, a total of 22 reacted with the fusion protein
expressed from the construct harboring the PvuII-StyI frag￾ment which encodes a 33-amino acid segment of P4501ID6
(Table I). The smallest segment of this 33-amino acid portion
of P4501ID6, which yields an immunoreactive protein when
fused with the 33-kD amino-terminal segment of anthranilate
synthetase, encodes the amino acid sequence DPAQPPRD
(Fig. 2). This small segment was recognized by 11 of the 26 sera
(Table I). Moreover, it was present in the smallest positive seg￾ments that were recognized by the remaining LKM-I sera (Ta￾ble I). Five sera did not recognize the product of any deletion
mutant smaller than that encoded by the PvuII-StyI fragment.
This included two 23-mers encoding amino- and carboxyl-ter￾minal segments of the 33-mer that overlapped for 11 amino
acids. This region of overlap included the eight-amino acid
core sequence recognized directly by 11 of the 26 antibodies.
Although two patient sera recognized each 23-mer, they did
not recognize a shorter construct encoding the I 1-amino acid
sequence shared by the two 23-mers. Four sera recognized a
15-mer that included the eight-amino acid "core" sequence
DPAQPPRD, and these same sera did not react with the C8-
mer and Cl 5-mer (Fig. 1), which overlapped the positive 15-
mer but did not contain the core sequence. In many cases, the
intensity of the signal diminished as the segment contained in
the pATH construct became shorter, and thus, the differences
in the size of the smallest segment which reacted with each
antibody could reflect differences in titer that limit detection of
their reactivity toward smaller fragments. We suspect that
some portion ofthe core sequence, DPAQPPRD, is a necessary
part of the epitope recognized by the majority of LKM-I anti￾bodies, but that it alone may not be sufficient for binding of all
LKM-l-positive sera when expressed as a fusion protein and/
or when tested by immunoblotting. Also, the differences seen
for these sera regarding their reactivity with segments smaller
than the 33-amino acid segment may reflect the influence of
the fusion protein on the conformation or accessibility of the
epitope.
All ofthe sera, including the four sera that did not recognize
the sequence encoded by the PvuII-StyI fragment expressed in
pATH, inhibit the binding to the native protein ofan antibody
recognizing the core epitope as judged by a competitive radio￾immunoassay. The results of this assay are summarized in Ta￾ble I, and examples are shown in Fig. 3. In this assay, IgG was
purified from the serum ofthe chronic active hepatitis patient,

Figure 3. Competition for binding to human liver microsomes be￾tween '23I-LKM-l IgG, from patient R.H., and other LKM-l sera.
The titers producing 40% inhibition for each serum are listed in Table
I. The examples shown exhibited differences in the smallest segment
of P4501ID6 which each recognized: The labeled antibody recognized
the 8-mer or larger; serum Bi.S. (i) recognized the 15-mer or larger,
serum M.M. (v) recognized the two overlapping 23-mers or larger;
serum L.R. (v) recognized the PvuII-StyI segment or larger; whereas
serum K.B. (v) recognizes the HLD8.2 cDNA but did not recognize
the shorter pATH constructs as judged by immunoblotting. No inhi￾bition by normal human serum was seen (o).
R.H., (Table I) and labeled with 1251. This serum recognizes a
single protein corresponding in size to P450IID6 in human
liver microsomes by immunoblotting as well as the shortest,
eight-amino acid segment of P45011D6 expressed from pATH.
The capacity ofdilutions ofthe other 25 LKM-I sera to inhibit
the binding of the '25I-antibody to human liver microsomes
was then determined. The highest dilution at which 40% or
greater inhibition was observed in experiments such as those
illustrated in Fig. 3 is reported in Table I. Although four sera do
not react with the short linear segments of P450IID6 expressed
from pATH constructs in E. coli asjudged by immunoblotting,
they clearly inhibit the binding of the reference antibody to
microsomal P450IID6 (Table I and the example shown in Fig.
3). The concentrations required were, however, at the high end
of the range seen for these sera (Table I). In contrast, sera that
react with the shortest segment generally inhibit the binding of
the reference serum at the lowest concentrations.
Antibodies to HCVproteins. As high as 78% ofLKM-1-pos￾itive sera from patients with idiopathic autoimmune chronic
active hepatitis have been reported to exhibit antibodies to
HCV protein C100-3 as judged by commercial ELISA proce￾dures (17-20). 1 1 of 24 LKM-1 sera tested from our panel were
shown to be positive for anti-HCV C100-3 using both the
Ortho Diagnostics ELISA and the Chiron Corp. RIBA tests
(Table I). All but two ofthe sera were also positive for the HCV
5-1 -1 protein, and all antisera were negative against superoxide
dismutase which is the fusion partner for expression of the
recombinant HCV proteins. As shown in Fig. 4, LKM- 1-posi￾tive patients whose sera react with the HCV C100-3 protein
used in these tests (14) generally exhibit a higher age and a
lower LKM-I antibody titer, asjudged by the competitive RIA,

lower female predominance is seen for anti-HCV positive sera
than is seen for the group that did not exhibit antibodies to
HCV proteins, as summarized in Table II. Both the HCV anti￾body-positive and -negative groups exhibit antibodies recog￾nizing the 8 amino acid segment of P450IID6 as well as sera
that did not react with the 33-amino acid or shorter epitopes
expressed as fusion proteins in this study.
In order to test whether the LKM-1 autoantibody recog￾nizes the C100-3 protein ofHCV used in the Ortho Diagnostics
ELISA, the antibody was affinity-purified from an anti-HCV￾positive serum by adsorption to the expressed recombinant
HLD 8.2 cDNA and subsequent elution as described earlier
(3). The purified antibody did not react with the HCV-encoded
C100-3 protein in the Ortho Diagnostics ELISA or Chiron
Corp. RIBA.
Sequence-relatedness of the epitope to other proteins. A
search of the Genbank, EMBL, and NBRF databases revealed
several sequences similar to that of the core epitope. With the
exception of other P450s of the HID subfamily, the most strik￾ing match occurs with the immediate-early protein IE175 of
HSV- 1. Identity is seen for the sequence, PAQPPR, which oc￾curs in both the IE175 (also denoted ICP4) protein of HSV-l
(21) and the core epitope. IE175 is expressed at relatively low
concentrations during early stages of infection to regulate sub￾sequent gene expression (22). Antibodies have been observed
to arise to this protein, and for neonatal patients, the presence
of these antibodies has been associated with a poor clinical
outcome (23).
A screen of patient sera revealed that 17 of the 20
LKM-1-positive sera tested were also positive for antibodies to
HSV-1 (Table I). When several of these were examined by im￾munoblotting they were found to react strongly with an exten￾sive array of proteins in lysates from BHK cells infected with
HSV- 1, whereas this reactivity was not seen for lysates from the
uninfected BHK cells. In the example shown in Fig. 5, the

serum from a LKM-1 positive patient, K.S., is also positive for
HSV-1 antibodies as demonstrated by reactivity with a large
number of proteins expressed in the cells infected with HSV-1,
whereas these proteins are not detected in uninfected cells or by
serum from the patient's identical twin (Fig. 5, K.S. twin) who
does not have autoimmune hepatitis or exhibit LKM-1 autoan￾tibodies (24). On the other hand, four LKM-l-positive sera
were negative not only when tested using the commercial assay
but also when examined by immunoblotting-Table I and ex￾ample shown in Fig. 5 (S.V.). Thus, most but not all
LKM-l-positive sera also exhibit extensive reactivity toward
proteins associated with HSV-I infection.
In order to determine whether the LKM-1 autoantibody
reactive with the small epitope was one of the antibodies that
recognize proteins associated with HSV-l infection, we immu￾noaffinity-purified the antibody using a peptide linked to sepha￾rose. A peptide was synthesized corresponding to the smallest

thiolpropyl sepharose (13). An LKM-l-positive serum was
then incubated with the peptide-Sepharose, and the seques￾tered LKM-1 antibody was subsequently eluted. As shown in
Fig. 6, the antibody eluted from the peptide-Sepharose reacts
strongly with both a 50-kD protein in human liver microsomes
as well as with the roughly 40 kD fusion protein containing the
sequence DPAQPPRD. In contrast, incubation ofLKM-I -pos￾itive sera with a peptide-Sepharose generated with a different
peptide, IQEEAQCLVEER, did not lead to isolation ofan anti￾body which detects these proteins in immunoblotting experi￾ments (data not shown).

the antibody in lysates from cells which were not infected. The
intensity ofthe band is weak and a 10 times greater amount of
BHK cell lysate was loaded in this experiment than that shown
in Fig. 5. This analysis does not indicate that the protein recog￾nized is 1E175, however, the estimated size of the protein de￾tected by the affinity-purified antibody, 150±20 kD, is consis￾tent with this possibility. This experiment also demonstrates
the ability of the peptide-Sepharose to purify the LKM-1 anti￾body effectively from antibodies in the serum that recognize
other proteins expressed in BHK cells infected with HSV- 1.
An ELISA assay was used to determine the extent to which
three-repeated adsorptions with the peptide-Sepharose reduced
the titer of the autoantibody against human liver microsomes.
As shown in Fig. 7, the titer was reduced by - 10-fold whereas
it was unaffected by adsorption with the control peptide linked
to Sepharose, indicating that this reactivity represents a major
component of the LKM-1 autoantibodies present. Immuno￾blotting demonstrated that the residual LKM-l autoantibodies
exhibit reactivity toward the smallest segment ofP4501ID6 ex￾pressed as a fusion protein, suggesting that incomplete adsorp￾tion contributed to the remaining reactivity (data not shown).
Discussion
The majority, 22 of 26, of LKM-1-positive sera from patients
with autoimmune chronic active hepatitis tested in this study
react with a 33-amino acid segment of P450HD6 when it is
expressed as a fusion protein. Most of these sera react with
smaller segments that include the sequence DPAQPPRD
which is recognized directly by 11 of the 22 sera that recognize

Figure 7. Determination of LKM- I autoantibody depletion by pep￾tide-Sepharoses. LKM-l-positive serum (Original, o) was incubated
with either the DPAQPPRDC-Sepharose (LKM-Seph, *) or an unre￾lated peptide Sepharose (Cntrl-Seph, o), as described in Methods. The
serum was recovered from the incubation and combined with the
first two washes. The volume was adjusted to yield a 1:100 dilution
relative to the original serum sample. Duplicate serial dilutions were
then used in an ELISA assay which employed human liver micro￾somes as the bound antigen. The amount of antibody bound to the
plate was determined using an alkaline-phosphatase conjugate to goat
anti-human IgG and monitoring color development at 405nm using
p-nitrophenyl phosphate as the substrate.
the 33-amino acid segment. Although the differences seen be￾tween sera in their ability to react with segments shorter than
the 33-amino acid sequence is suggestive of differences in the
epitope recognized by each sera, the conformation of the core
epitope may have been altered by the deletion of flanking se￾quences and the subsequent replacement of these segments
with elements of the fusion protein. This might diminish the
binding of the short segment with LKM-I antibodies, and the
binding of low titer sera with the short segment might not be
detectable for this reason.
A comparison ofthe sequences of P45011D6 with class HID
sequences from other species which are known to react with
LKM-I antibodies is consistent with this assessment. Gueguen
et al. (25) screened a XGTI 1, rat liver cDNA library using three
LKM-l-positive sera from children. They characterized four
immunopositive, partial cDNAs corresponding to rat
P45011D1 and P4501ID2. These clones exhibited a 350-bp re￾gion of overlap leading these authors to speculate that the re￾gion of overlap encoded the epitope recognized by the three
antisera. From the restriction maps presented by these authors
(25), this region of overlap appears to contain rat sequences
which align with the epitope identified in our studies. As is
shown in Fig. 8, the sequence ofthe core epitope is conserved in
both rat P45011D1 and P450IID2, whereas flanking sequences
are seen to diverge. In addition, we have sequenced a partial
cDNA which was identified and isolated from a rabbit liver
cDNA library by hybridization with the HLD 8.2 cDNA. This
fragment encodes amino acids corresponding to 158-427 of
human P450IID6, and the fusion protein expressed from this
plasmid is also recognized by LKM-1 antibodies (Johnson,
E. F., and K. J. Griffin, unpublished observation). The amino
acid sequence predicted from the nucleotide sequence is also
shown in Fig. 8 for the region corresponding to the epitope.
Specific details regarding the location of the epitope in the
structure of P450IID6 have not been determined, although a
correspondence with the structure of P450CI, a distantly re￾A:

lated form of P450, has been predicted by several investigators
(30-32). Based on these models, the core epitope recognized by
LKM-1 antibodies would occur between helices corresponding
to G and H ofP450CI which is a protruding loop on the surface
of the P450CI enzyme (33).
The genesis of autoantibodies to such a highly conserved
region ofthe protein is unknown. Although host factors such as
HLA restriction and the polymorphism of P4501ID6 genes
could contribute to an idiotypic autoimmune response that
leads to LKM-1 autoantibodies, environmental factors are also
thought to contribute to this process. For instance, one of the
patients under study in this report has an identical twin. The
twins exhibit identical HLA types, and each is an obligate het￾erozygote for a wild type and a defective allele of P450IID6.
Yet only one of the twins is affected by this autoimmune dis￾order and exhibits LKM-l autoantibodies (24), suggesting that
some environmental factor contributes to the development of
disease.
Viruses have been implicated as causative agents in au￾toimmune disorders (34, 35), and we have shown that the epi￾tope defined here contains a six-amino acid sequence found in
the IE175 protein of HSV- 1 (21). Many, but not all,
LKM-1-positive patient sera including many of those that
react with the short linear sequence exhibit immunoreactivity
toward a large number of proteins associated with HSV-l in￾fection ofBHK cells. This group includes the patient who is the
only one of a twin pair affected by autoimmune hepatitis. The
other twin does not exhibit reactivity with proteins associated
with HSV-l infection of BHK cells (Fig. 5). A peptide corre￾sponding to the short linear epitope was used for the affinity
purification of LKM-1 antibodies from a patient's serum. In
contrast to the large number of proteins that react with the
complete serum, the purified antibody reacts with only a single
protein associated with HSV-l infection of BHK cells. This
does not confirm that LKM-1 antibodies react with IE175, but
it does illustrate the potential for cross recognition of proteins
associated with viral infection.
While such "mimicry" has been suggested to lead to autoim￾munity (34, 35), it seems unlikely that all LKM-1 antibodies
arise directly from an immune response to IE 175. First, 4 of 20
LKM-1 sera do not exhibit evidence for other antibodies di￾rected toward HSV- 1 proteins as judged by a commercial as￾say, and one of these sera reacts with the smallest, eight-amino
acid, core epitope. Secondly, the differences seen between
LKM-1 antibodies suggest that although many recognize this
short epitope they are generally more reactive toward larger
segments of P4501ID6 which do not appear to mimic IE175.
HCV has been implicated as the major causative agent of
NonA, NonB-transfusion related hepatitis (14, 36). Antibodies
to HCV proteins have been reported to occur frequently (up to
78%) in LKM-l-positive autoimmune hepatitis patients (17-
20), whereas the incidence of anti-HCV in other groups of
autoimmune liver diseases is less profound (Manns, Gerken,
Hess, and Meyer zum Buschenfelde, unpublished data). In our
study, anti-HCV-positive patients were found to have, on
average, a higher age, lower LKM-I inhibitory titers in the RIA
and a lower predominance of females as compared with the
anti-HCV-negative patients. This suggests that LKM-1 anti￾bodies may be associated with at least two distinct populations
that reflect different origins for this disorder.
HCV has been associated with an autoimmune response to
an endogenous antigen of unknown function. Mishiro et al.
(28) identified autoantibodies in the sera of 87% of the nonA-,
nonB-hepatitis patients tested that recognize an endogenous
protein encoded by a cDNA designated, GOR47-1. 67% of
these patients were positive for anti-HCV (C 100-3), and HCV￾related mRNAs were detected in additional patients using a
polymerase chain reaction assay. This raises the possibility that
HCV contributes to the autoimmune response to P450IID6.
Although LKM-l antibodies affinity-purified from the fusion
protein derived from the HLD8.2 cDNA do not cross-react
with the HCV C100-3 protein, the segment of P45011D6 har￾boring the epitope recognized by LKM-l antibodies exhibits
partial sequence identity with the other segments of the poly￾protein encoded by HCV as well as the GOR47-1 autoantigen.
Two segments of the polyprotein (29) that are not present in
the C100-3 or 5-1-1 protein (37) exhibit partial sequence iden￾tity with P450IID6 (Fig. 8). One significantly overlaps the core
epitope whereas the other is found in the region that flanks the
core epitope in the 33-amino acid immunoreactive segment.
Moreover, five of six amino acids in a segment ofthe GOR47-1
epitope occur adjacent to the epitope defined in this study for
LKM-I antibodies in the sequence ofP450IID6 (Fig. 8). These
similarities suggest a potential for immune cross-recognition
between P45011D6 and the HCV polyprotein as well as the
GOR47-1 protein which could be related to the occurrence of
LKM-l autoantibodies in patients with autoimmune hepatitis
that are seropositive for anti-HCV.
Future studies will have to evaluate the role ofeither HSV-l
or HCV in the etiology of autoimmune liver disease. In addi￾tion, work is in progress to define T cell epitopes for P45011D6,
and the constructions made in this study will be useful for this
purpose. It will be interesting to determine whether the amino
acid segments that flank the core epitope and display identity
with HCV and GOR47-1 represent T cell epitopes.
