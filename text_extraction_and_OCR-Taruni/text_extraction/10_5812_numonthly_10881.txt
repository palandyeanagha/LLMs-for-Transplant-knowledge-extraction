Background: Urologic complications are of the most important complications after kidney transplantation which increases mortality 
and morbidity significantly.
Objectives: We designed this study to evaluate the association between ureteral length and postoperative complications.
Patients and Methods: We recorded the length of the transplanted ureter during the operation. Ureter-to-bladder anastomosis was 
performed using modified Lich-Gregoir method on the ureteral stent. Complications like urine leakage and increased creatinine were
evaluated. We used both univariate and multivariate analyses and survival analysis according lengths of ureter. It means that the main 
variable is ureteral length and other variables are studied based on it.
Result: A total of 395 patients with the mean age of 37 years (range, 18 to 68 years) were enrolled in the study, twenty six graft lost during 
the follow-up period. The Mean age of recipients was 37 ± 13 years. Urinary stenosis was seen in 6 patients (1.5%) and urinary leakage in 4 (1%) 
patients. The complication rate was not significantly different between these groups (P = 0.67). We found that there were no significant 
difference among complication (P = 0.25), hospitalization (P = 0.31) and survival (P = 0.84) at 5.5 cm length cut off.
Conclusions: The length of transplanted ureter does not affect the postoperative urologic complications (including urinary fistula and 
ureter-to-bladder anastomosis stricture), and it seems that decreased rate of complication frequency during the recent years is due to 
technical improvement, surgeon’s skillfulness and development in use of immunosuppressant’s postoperatively.

1. Background
Urological complications remain an important source 
of morbidity and occasionally mortality, after renal trans￾plantation (1, 2). Urinary anastomotic complications 
following renal transplantation cause significant pa￾tient morbidity (3, 4). Urologic complications after renal 
transplantation may cause significant morbidity which 
seriously affects graft outcomes. The incidence of these 
complications has been reported to be 6.5% to 20%. Many 
donor, recipient, and post transplantation factors may 
contribute to the development of urologic complications 
(5). However, the incidence of urological complications af￾ter kidney transplantations is not known, nor their effect 
on graft survival (6, 7).
Patients with a urinary anastomotic complication have 
significantly more hospitalizations in first year after 
transplantation. The top readmission codes suggest that 
patient specific morbidity is directly related to the anasto￾motic complication and graft dysfunction. Fluid balance 
abnormalities develop, manifesting as fluid overload and 
increased acute cardiac events. Urinary tract and non-UTI 
infectious complications are also significantly increased 
in this patient population for unknown reasons. Acute 
renal failure is almost 2.5 times more likely to develop 
in patients with urinary anastomotic complications. 
Urinary leakage from ureteral anastomosis can lead to 
increased patient morbidity and costs (6).
Urologic complications of kidney transplantation have 
significantly decreased during the recent years. It seems 
that the most important factor for this decrease is firstly 
due to an improvement in immunosuppressive regimens 
and reduction in their use, and secondly due to technical 
improvements and the skillfulness of kidney surgeons 
(8, 9). The most common and important postoperative 
urologic complications after kidney transplantation are 
urinary fistula and then ureteral stricture (10, 11).
The association between the complication occurrence 
and the surgical technique has been evaluated in several

studies (12-14). One of the most important factors influ￾encing surgical technique is ureteral blood supply and 
ischemia in transplanted ureteral tissue. In some stud￾ies, ureteral length has been demonstrated as an effective 
factor in distal ureteral blood supply. However, other fac￾tors have also been proposed as factors resulting in uro￾logic complications.
2. Objectives
Regarding increased rate of kidney transplantation 
during the past decades, this study was performed to 
evaluate the occurrence of long-term and short-term 
complications after the kidney transplantation and their 
association with the length of transplanted ureter. Al￾though some effective factors have been previously eval￾uated in past studies, the role of ureteral length has not 
been evaluated so far.
3. Patients and Methods
3.1. Study Population
Between January 2008 and January 2011, 395 patients un￾dergoing kidney transplantation in the Baqiyatallah and 
Moddares transplant centers of Tehran, Iran, were enrolled 
in the study. The kidney transplant recipients recruited at 
different times after kidney transplantation discharge.
3.2. Ethics
The protocol of this study was approved by the ethics 
committee of Baqiyatallah university of medical science, 
faculty of medicine.
3.3. Surgery Technique
Several operating surgeons were involved, of consultant 
or specialist registrar grade. In all but three procedures a 
Leadbetter-Politano ureteroneocystostomy was used, in￾volving the passage of the ureter through a submucosal 
tunnel fashioned via a separate anterior cystostomy. Two 
cases required primary ureteroureterostomy for a short do￾nor ureter. In one procedure the ureter was implanted into 
a bladder caecoplasty. Ureteric stents were used rarely. A Fol￾ey catheter was used to drain the bladders of all patients for 
at least 5 days after the operation. Daily serum biochemistry 
was combined with careful clinical observation to moni￾tor graft function then image all grafts by ultrasonography 
soon after the operation, usually in the first or second day, 
to detect early signs of vascular or urological complications. 
This succeeds the former practice of imaging only in those 
with suspected graft dysfunction.
3.4. Immunosuppressant Regimen
Cyclosporine (CsA) was taken orally as a basic drug for 
immunosuppression in kidney transplant patients; My￾cophenolate Mofetil/Azathioprine and Prednisolone were 
also used. To prevent rejection, high doses of CsA were rou￾tinely started and it was reduced subsequently. The dosage 
was initially determined by the body weight of the indi￾viduals and subsequently by the CsA blood Levels. Dosages 
also varied from one individual to another depending on 
the patient's ability to withstand organ rejection. Our tar￾get for cyclosporine through level (C0) blood levels were 
200 to 300 ng/mL in months one to three after transplanta￾tion, 100 to 250 ng/mL in 4 to 12 months and 100 to 150 ng/
mL in more than 1 year after the transplantation; though 
the 2-hour post dose level of CsA (C2) optimum levels of 
800 to 1000 ng/mL 1 to 3 months after transplantation and 
C2 targets of 400 to 600 ng/mL for following months.
3.5. Variables
Routine laboratory investigations included creatinine 
(Cr). The biochemical analyzes were performed by the 
unique laboratory using automatic systems with modifi￾cation of the kinetic Jaffe reaction (Cr).
3.6. Definitions
Graft loss to chronic rejection was defined by patho￾logic findings, on biopsy or at nephrectomy, that were 
consistent with chronic rejection. The concept of defin￾ing death with function as graft loss originated with 
the recognition that many post-transplant deaths (with 
function) were due to infection secondary to the surgery 
and immunosuppressive regimens; more recently, it has 
been noted that immunosuppression-related hyperten￾sion, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes affect post-transplant 
mortality.
3.7. Statistical Analysis
The SPSS version 17.0 for Windows was used in all the 
analyses. Quantitative variables were expressed as mean 
± standard deviation (SD), while qualitative variables 
were shown by number and percentage. The kolmogorov￾simirnov test showed that ureteral length distributed 
normally; hence, T test analysis was used to study correla￾tions between complication and ureteral length less and 
more than 5.5 cm, for assessing highest specific and sensi￾tive ureteral length we used ROC Curve estimation and we 
used Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. In all analyses P < 0.05 
was considered significant with 95% confidence Interval.

for complication (Figure 1).
The patients were divided into 2 groups regarding the 
ureteral length. The complication rate was not signifi￾cantly different between these groups (P = 0.67).
5. Discussion
Surgical complications remain a significant clinical 
problem after renal transplantation. Ureteral obstruc￾tion following transplantation is not uncommon. Per￾sistent obstruction of the ureterovesical anastomosis is 
the most common urologic complication. Obstruction 
occurring beyond the first postoperative month remains 
frequent (2-7.5%) and mostly related to ureteral stenosis. 
The overall incidence of urologic complications in our se￾ries was low, which was comparable to those reported by 
other major centers (15-18).
Urologic complications associated with the ureterovesi￾cal anastomosis after transplantation may cause graft 
loss and mortality (19). Complications vary from around 
20% to less than 5% (15, 16). At many transplantation cen￾ters, surgeons have adopted new suture techniques. Sev￾eral preventive measures have been added to this tech￾nique to prevent urologic complications (16).
Figure 1. Roc Curve of Ureteral Length and Graft Loss
For avoiding anastomotic stricture, kinking and uri￾nary leakage, some surgeons routinely anastomose ure￾ter to bladder over an ureteral stent (20, 21).
Our major finding was that ureteral length is not re￾lated to kidney transplantation complication although 
it showed that ischemia is the most common cause of 
distal ureteral stricture formation often involving the 
ureterovesical junction. The association between the 
ureteral complications and the length of transplanted 
ureter has always been in attention due to its probable 
role in ischemia of the transplanted ureteral tissue ant it 
is challenging.

According to our findings, the ureteral length was not 
significantly different in the patients with and without 
complications. This compromised blood supply can be 
due to problems in operative technique during harvest￾ing or high dose of immunosuppression (22). Some ex￾perience with rat showed that preservation of adequate 
blood supply to the ureter in renal transplantation pro￾vides more consistent results and lessens the risk of un￾necessary animal loss (23). Other risk factors for ureteral 
stenosis include (24) ischemia, rejection, calculi, fungal 
ball, clots, technical error, fluid compression (25-31).
Several studies have been performed in this regard; 
however, demographic and anatomic factors have not 
been studied in none of them. Benoit and colleagues 
studied 430 patients with kidney transplantation within 
5 years and showed that urologic complication rate was 
about 12% in ureteroureterostomy while it was about 6.7% 
in ureteroneocystostomy. It was also demonstrated that 
the major factor in occurrence of ureteral complications 
is transplanted ureteral length rather than the type of 
ureteral anastomosis; i.e., the longer the ureter, the more 
the urologic complications (12). McDonald and cowork￾ers showed that ureteroneocystostomy accompanies by 
a decrease in the complication rates, and one reason for 
this decrease is the need for a shorter ureter. Also, using 
this technique, catheter cystostomy was not necessary 
and antireflux mechanism was preserved (14). Actually, in 
both studies mentioned, ureteral blood supply has been 
regarded as a dependent variable to the ureteral length. 
They only concluded the study regarding the ureter-to￾bladder anastomosis technique without the measure￾ment of the ureteral length.
Khavli and colleagues studied these two subjects sepa￾rately on animal models for the first time and evaluated 
the transplanted ureteral blood supply regarding the 
technique used for detachment of the ureter from ad￾jacent tissues. They concluded that the preservation of 
the gonadal artery causes in significant decrease in the 
occurrence of ureteral complications (23). Alfani and 
coworkers showed that the obstruction of transplanted 
ureter may be an early or late complication, and usually 
does not cause kidney colic because of the lack of inner￾vation to the transplanted kidney. They showed that the 
obstruction usually occurs at the end of the distal ureter. 
They proposed the probable cause of ischemia for this 
and emphasized that the effective factor in obstruction 
of transplanted ureter is the involvement of pelvis and 
ureter and fibrosis of the adjacent tissues. They conclud￾ed that the ureteral obstruction hardly happens without 
hydronephrosis (32). Cecka and colleagues defined the 
damage during the surgery and distal ureter ischemia 
as the most important effective factors on urinary fistula 
(10, 33). Thomalla showed that urinary fistula may affect 
transplantation rejection because of inappropriate de￾tachment of the donor ureter, stretch on transplanted 
ureter due to the shortness of the detached ureter, rup￾ture of the ureter or the kidney pelvis due to severe ob￾struction, deep and invasive infection of the wound, 
ureter destruction because of the pelvic infection, and/or 

Ali-Asgari M et al.

slow blood supply. He concluded that the ureteral length 
was an effective factor only in case of being short (be￾cause of the stretch on the ureter) (34).
 In our study lower complication versus 9% in Benoit’s 
study is probably due to improvement in surgical tech￾niques, increased skillfulness of the surgeons, develop￾ment in using immunosuppressive drugs after the trans￾plantation. The authors emphasized that the urologic 
complications after kidney transplantation are affected 
by the position of the transplanted kidney, kidney posi￾tioning and the type of ureteral anastomosis. The differ￾ence in the results between their study and ours is prob￾ably due to using ureteroureterostomy by them which 
accompanies with high complication rates. But after 
changing their method from ureteroureterostomy to 
ureteroneocystostomy, the complication rate decreased 
significantly, and this resulted in less accuracy in their 
study.
Conclusion: According to our findings, it can be con￾cluded that the length of the transplanted ureter does 
not have any association with the frequency of urologic 
complication occurrence. It seems that improvement in 
surgical techniques, surgeons’ skillfulness and develop￾ment in using immunosuppressive drugs are the factors 
decreasing this rate. We can conclude that not consid￾ering the ureteral length is a safe limit in kidney trans￾plantation surgeries, and ureters between 7–12 m can be 
anastomosed safely without any effect on urologic com￾plications rate.
