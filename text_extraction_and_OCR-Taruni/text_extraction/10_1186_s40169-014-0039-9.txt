Introduction
Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the head and neck (HNC)
is a complex neoplastic disease that affects the face, cra￾nium, and neck. Clinically, HNC has usually invaded
vital aerodigestive tract anatomy at presentation, and
often affects key sensory nerves in the peripheral ner￾vous system. The worldwide incidence of HNC is esti￾mated at greater than 550,000 new diagnoses per year
accounting for 15–20 new cases per 100,000 individuals
[1]. Despite extensive well-powered studies and the
emergence of targeted therapy, 5-year survival rates in
HNC remain at approximately 50% [2]. This poor sur￾vival is likely due to the fact that local invasion, lymph
node involvement and metastasis are often present at
the time of diagnosis. The head and neck contain nearly
40 percent of the 800 lymph nodes present through￾out the body making invasive disease a serious clinical
concern [3].
Review
Local invasion and metastasis are associated with Epithelial
to Mesenchymal transition (EMT) and hold negative prog￾nostic value. Median 5-year overall survival (OS) rates in
HNC have held steady at 50% but decline to 10% when
local metastasis is present at diagnosis [4].
While differing slightly by anatomic site, local invasion
in the ipsilateral field is present in ~50% of HNC at
diagnosis and contralateral and bilateral invasion ap￾proach ~35% [3]. Figure 1 shows the stage at presenta￾tion of HNC by anatomic site: at all sites, HNC presents
at either stage III or IV in at least 60% of the cases, and
tumors of the nasopharynx, oropharynx/tonsil and glottis
present at stage III or IV in over 98% of the cases. There￾fore, these tumors carry a higher overall metastasis risk.
Local invasion and extracapsular spread require extensive
and complex resection and chemoradiotherapy [3,5].
Genomic studies over the past decade have begun to
dissect the complex underlying biology in HNC, which
is often associated with tobacco and alcohol use. Fur￾thermore, involvement of high-risk papillomavirus (HPV)
as an etiologic factor in some tumors of the head and
neck, first posited by Syrjänen and colleagues in 1983, has
now been positively demonstrated [4,6-8]. The addition of
HPV-surveillance by p16 staining and molecular testing
has become commonplace in the work-up of these tu￾mors, and cases of HPV-mediated disease are on the rise
[9]. Despite ample evidence for the role of HPV in cancer
development at genital and skin sites in humans, it has
taken several decades to connect HPV with HNC [10].
Seminal studies of canine oral papillomatosis suggested a
role for EMT in tumors of the oropharynx [11,12]. Like
early observations in animals, models of papillomavirus￾mediated transformation in human cells demonstrated
hallmarks of EMT including induction of spindle morph￾ology [13]. In HNC, the molecular findings of basic sci￾ence studies of EMT have culminated in an ongoing effort
to translate this entity into targeted therapeutics. Perhaps
the greatest leaps forward have occurred in the molecular

characterization of different types of HNC owing mainly
to genomic, epigenomic, and transcriptomic sequencing
studies [14-19]. In spite of this progress, EMT and the mo￾lecular underpinnings have not yet yielded robust clinical
targets.
In this review, we discuss the translational relevance of
EMT mechanisms in HNC and integrate these findings
with the novel molecular picture emerging for this het￾erogeneous disease. We focus on the respective roles of
viral infection and EMT in tumors of the head and neck;
mechanisms of induction of EMT; the clinicopathologic
outcomes associated with increased invasion; and how
emerging therapies may take advantage of EMT determi￾nants and markers.
Translational hallmarks of EMT in embryogenesis and HNC
EMT is a highly conserved process in development,
cellular physiology and wound healing in every tissue
compartment. First recognized in embryogenesis, the
concept of EMT as a molecular program was suggested
by Hay and Greenburg in 1982 [20]. This seminal de￾scription has been extensively refined and expanded, to
include epithelial loss of anchorage dependence with the
basal membrane, followed by fundamental alterations in
genomic and epigenomic program execution in cellular
polarity and motility [21,22]. Classic EMT-associated
changes in protein expression coincide with loss of cell-cell
adhesion complexes (e-Cadherin to n-Cadherin shift, in￾creased β-catenin transcriptional activity) and induction
of mesenchymal cell adhesion molecules Vimentin (VIM),
Fibronection (Fn). Malignant cells also evade anoikis- or
cell-microenvironment adhesion-dependent programmed
cell death - by up-regulation of autocrine signalling
from pro-survival factors epidermal growth factor re￾ceptor (EGFR), and transforming factor - beta (TGF β)
which reduce Bax/Bak and Fas/Fas-Ligand-associated
apoptosis. Loss of anchorage-dependent apico-basal orienta￾tion also corresponds with changes in cell morphology (i.e.,
stress f-Actin reorganization) and activation of GTPases
(Cdc42 and Rac1), activation of planar polarity transcrip￾tional programs (Pars/Crumbs, Snail, Slug), and degrad￾ation of the basement membrane via proteolytic enzymes
(i.e., matrix metallo-proteinases, MMPs). These alterations
allow cancer cells to induce peritumoral angio- and
neuro-genesis, followed by metastasis and perineural
spread, respectively. A variety of well-characterized types
of EMT have been described. These include Developmen￾tal (Type I); Fibrosis and wound-healing (Type II); and
oncogenic (Type III) [21]. However, advances in the un￾derstanding of the contributions from various highly con￾served molecular pathways have blurred the lines
between these three types. The general molecular un￾derpinnings of EMT have been extensively reviewed
elsewhere [21-24]. Here, we focus on the parallels
across EMT types and the evidence for their involve￾ment in HNC Cancer.
During gastrulation, the embryo undergoes specific
modifications, among which is the establishment of stem
cell polarity. This event is particularly pronounced dur￾ing the early formation of the neural epithelium of the

neural crest [23]. Within the context of the head and
neck, these structures undergo profound differentiation
leading to the formation of sensory and craniofacial
structures derived from the neuroectoderm. In cranio￾facial development, molecular programming revolves
around signals transduced by the central EMT modula￾tor transforming growth-factor beta (TGFβ). TGFβ￾family ligands are responsible for activating a symphony
of developmental transcriptional programs [24]. A grow￾ing body of evidence suggests the importance of various
homeobox transcription factors, polycomb repressive
complexes, and stem cell differentiation factors in this
dynamic process. In cancer stem cells, EMT activation
promotes aberrant activation of developmental pro￾grams downstream of canonical Wnt, Notch, and Sonic
Hedgehog (SHH) pathways (Reviewed in [24,25]).
Evidence for the involvement of these pathways in
HNC development was first suggested from laser cap￾tured oropharyngeal biopsies, where increased expression
of Frizzled1/3 (FRZ1/3) G protein coupled receptors
(GPCRs), Dishevelled phosphoproteins (Dvl), and β￾Catenin, (Wnt); Notch1/2 receptors, and Jagged ligand
(Notch); and Patched (SHH) was observed [26]. In vitro,
dysregulated Wnt/β-Catenin was shown to increase cellu￾lar invasiveness and decrease anoikis, both hallmarks of
EMT [27]. Analysis of fresh frozen specimens from 22 pa￾tients showed that a reduction in inhibitory Wnt-7a with a
concomitant increase in frizzled 5 (FRZ5) and Wnt-5a
correlated with reduced patient survival [28]. Markers of
dysregulation of intrinsic feedback responses to increased
β-Catenin – such as increased expression of Dickkopf-3
(Dkk3) – have also been demonstrated to correlate with
poor survival and increased metastasis in HNC patients
[29]. In addition, epigenetic modifications have been
detected in patient-derived cell lines demonstrating hyper￾methylation of Dickkopf-1 (Dkk-1), secreted frizzled￾related peptides 1, 2, and 4 (SFRP1/2/4), and Wnt inhibitor
factor 1 (WIF-1) [29-31].
Studies of EMT in cancer-stem cells
The discovery of epithelial stem-like cell drivers in can￾cer has revolutionized the search for the elusive Achilles
heel in many neoplasms. HNC cancer-stem like cells have
been isolated from patient-derived lesions and leveraged to
identify novel therapeutic targets. Mattox and Von Hoff
first observed the ability of poorly differentiated patient￾derived HNC cells to grow in soft agar in 1980 [32,33].
These observations took nearly two decades to mature into
the current molecular theories that – in HNC – were sug￾gested by Braakhuis, Leemans, and Brakenhoff [34].
A variety of stem cell molecular markers have been
described in HNC including prominin-1 (CD133), the
hyaluronic acid receptor CD44, Aldehyde-dehydrogenase 1
(ALDH1), and SOX2, Nanog, and OCT4, as well as basal
keratinocyte marker cytokeratin 14 [35]. Importantly,
CD133/OCT4/Nanog correlate with poor overall survival
in a cohort of 52 oral carcinoma patients [36]. These devel￾opmental pathways synergize to drive EMT and invasive￾ness, are present in poorly differentiated lesions, and are
linked to increased resistance to chemotherapeutic regi￾mens. Figure 2 presents a synopsis of synergizing EMT and
stem cell markers that have been linked to clinical course.
EMT and local invasion, field cancerization, perineural
invasion, and metastasis
EMT remains a controversial pathobiological model in
the clinical setting, and some question the validity of the
concept outside of the confines of in vitro conditions
and embryonal development [37]. Despite these dissent￾ing opinions, EMT mechanisms are still regarded as the
leading hypothesis for the process of cellular loss of ad￾hesion and spreading, and many studies, including gene
expression profiling of HNC readily demonstrate the
expression of markers classically associated with EMT
[25,38,39]. At diagnosis, it is believed that 2/3 of HNC
tumors harbor micrometastasis and locoregional invasion
[40]. These prognostic indicators of enhanced morbidity
are driven by a common feature of HNC lesions known as
field cancerization. First suggested by Slaughter and col￾leagues, field cancerization is the development of a field of
genetically altered cells in the context of a tissue. Within
this altered field, the expansion of a patch of cells with in￾creased proliferative and invasive potential gives rise to a
tumor. This concept explains why cells in epithelia sur￾rounding a tumor may present with some of the genetic
and gene expression alterations found in the tumor cells
[41,42]. It is not uncommon to find micro – primary and
second primaries occupying cryptic sites (such as the base
of tongue or tonsillar crypts) following additional diagnos￾tic work-up in HNC. HPV-driven HNC is clinically differ￾entiable from HPV-negative disease due to marked
reduction in field cancerization, while nodal metastases are
actually more frequently present at diagnosis [43,44].
EMT drives local invasion principally via the mecha￾nisms discussed above and several key transcription factors
governing EMT have been demonstrated in metastatic dis￾ease. Among these, the most prominent molecular features
include enhanced expression of the transcription factors
Snail 1 and 2 (SNAI1 and SNAI2- aka Slug) as well as
SIX1, TWIST, and ZEB 1 and 2. Many of these develop￾mental transcription factors are hijacked from their normal
roles in maintaining tissue homeostasis, and their functions
center around the TGF-β super family [25]. The import￾ance of these transcription factors in head and neck devel￾opment is reflected in animal studies, where mutant Snail
and Slug result in craniofacial aberrations [45]. In kerati￾nocytes, Slug plays a critical role in inducing the motile
state in Type II EMT wound healing [46]. Decreases of

downstream cell adhesion molecules and expression of
mesenchymal markers are common features in many
carcinomas and are not exclusive to HNC. Invasive HNC
lesions often down-regulate E-Cadherin and up-regulate
N-cadherin, vimentin, and Slug [47]. This program is in￾creasingly detected as an early and dynamic event in the
evolution of the disease. Furthermore, the E- to N￾cadherin shift is sentinel in the evolution of premalignant
lesions to carcinoma in situ and neoplasia [48] (Table 1).
In support of these observations, Slug over expression
has been recently found to correlate with increased
lymph node involvement and higher TNM status in a
study of 119 HNC [52]. Several immunohistochemical
studies have demonstrated involvement of Snail in HNC;
however, these results and their impact on prognosis
have been conflicting. Yang et al. showed a correlation
between augmented NBS1 and TWIST and Snail expres￾sion in tissue microarrays of HNC [49,50]. In a recent,
well-designed study, 52% of cases stained intensely for
Snail and this correlated with increased lymphovascular
involvement, basaloid differentiation, and nodal metasta￾sis [62]. These results are in contrast to other studies of
archival specimens and related clinical data, which found
no significant impact of Snail on patient prognosis [63].
The well-known oncogenic viruses Epstein-Barr Virus
(EBV) has also been found to associate with enhanced
EMT markers in HNC lesions [64] (Table 1).
Interestingly, perineural invasion – which is associated
with a significant decrease of overall survival and in￾creased metastasis – is enhanced in pro-inflammatory
microenvironments (i.e., elevated cytokine/NFκβ activa￾tion) and in invasive disease [51]. The mechanisms of
classically defined Type III EMT and perineural spread
and invasion are distinct, but have some areas of overlap.
For example, a likely player in perineural invasion is the
neurotrophin tropomyosin-related kinase (NTRK2 aka
TrkB) which signals downstream of brain derived neuro￾trophic factor (BDNF) [65]. TrkB has been demonstrated
to be a key regulator of EMT in HNC and TrkB overex￾pression leads to increased invasiveness, resulting in a
refractory response to chemotherapy [66,67]. Another
line of evidence supporting the importance of neurotro￾phins in HNC has also emerged in the low-affinity TrkB
co-receptor NGFR. Patient-based studies of NGFR- posi￾tive lesions had marked invasiveness and a locoregional re￾currence rate 17 times greater than NGFR-negative lesions
[68]. Fujii et al. also found a correlation between en￾hanced repressors of E-Cadherin and perineural inva￾sion and demonstrated a significant association of
perineural invasion with SIP1 and TWIST but not Snail
expression [69]. These findings are intriguing and offer
early clues on the specific extracellular interactions
that promote invasiveness (Figure 3). Future transla￾tional studies will be required to dissect the relevance of
Figure 2 Following genotoxic insult (Mutations (for example: loss of tumor suppressor p53, cyclin-dependent kinase N2A (CDKN2A));
HPV infection, etc.) microenvironmental signals initiate and enhance pro-EMT pathology. Molecular signaling from the millieu promotes
degradation of the extracellular matrix (ECM; Vimentin expression, matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) secretion); increased local and perineural
invasion, angiogenesis, hyper mitotic features followed by hypoxia and intratumoral necrosis in parallel with tumor growth and metastasis.

these diverse mechanisms and their impact on EMT and
invasion in HNC.
Closing the gap between basic science and clinical
relevance will likely require more direct evidence. To
this end, perhaps tumor cell tracing studies conducted
with gene expression analysis of primary and metastatic
tissue or evaluation of circulating tumor cells might pro￾vide some resolution to this controversy.
HPV, EMT, and the environment: preclinical data,
translational insight
HNC lesions arise from direct and indirect environmen￾tal exposure to known carcinogens including tobacco,
alcohol, and oncogenic viruses. A majority of cases arise
in older patients with substance-use and high-risk oral
sexual practices.
In a study of 171 patients, tobacco use was signifi￾cantly correlated with increased cervical metastasis (100%)
compared to 54% of non-users [70]. Tobacco smoke and
nicotine augment EMT in HNC models [71]. The risk￾association of alcohol use and HNC is also well known. As
most patients present with comorbid risks, emerging
animal models are incorporating ethanol and tobacco ex￾posure with high risk HPV infection [72].
The initial controversy surrounding the role of HPV￾infection and transformation of the basal keratinocytes
of the oral mucosae in HNC neoplastic transformation
has largely subsided. As mentioned above, there is little
clinical evidence for increased EMT in HPV-driven dis￾ease. Accordingly, gene expression profiles of HNC can￾cers show that markers of EMT, cell motility, invasiveness
and angiogenesis predominate in HPV-negative cancers,
while HPV-driven tumors are characterized primarily by
alterations of the cell cycle, mitosis and proliferation [38].
However, while proliferation and cell cycle markers are
virtually absent in HPV-negative cancers, HPV-positive
cancers exhibit some changes related to EMT. HPV￾mediated transformation of human keratinocytes in vitro
alters TGFβ responses in such a way as to reduce the
growth-inhibitory effects of TGFβ, leaving intact the EMT
responses to this cytokine, therefore effectively promoting
EMT. Based on these observations and on the results of
gene expression profiles of HNC, we postulate that the
pronounced EMT observed in HPV-negative cancers

may be the result of mutations or permanent epigenetic
changes, while in HPV-driven cancers EMT may be a
dynamic response to TGFβ and/or to the overexpression
of the homeobox transcription factor SIX1 [39,73-76].
Here below we discuss some of the specific observations
upon which we base this hypothesis.
Highly reproducible in vitro transformation studies in
keratinocytes of various origins have provided important
mechanistic insight with regards to the involvement of
HPV in the transformation of human cells. We were the
first to transform human foreskin keratinocytes derived
from neonate donors using the HPV16 genome [77]. In
the resulting model system for HPV-mediated multistep
transformation of human keratinocytes (Figure 4), we
demonstrated that HPV16 induces pre-neoplastic alter￾ations that parallel many of the molecular changes de￾tected in cervical cancer [78], therefore validating the
model system as a suitable context in which to study
Figure 3 Known molecular EMT mechanisms can be classified into 5 major overlapping categories. 1: Growth Promoting/Proliferative
Pathways are driven primarily by receptor tyrosine kinases, serine/threonine kinases, and cytokine receptors (many removed for clarity). Transforming
Growth factor-beta (TGF β) and epidermal growth factor (EGFR) and other receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs; For example: TrkB, Fibroblast growth factor
receptor 1(FGFR1), etc.) signal via various intracellular kinases including mitogen activated kinase (p38/MAPK); Phosphoinositol-3-kinase (PI3k/Akt); and
Ras-oncogene-MEK-ERK. TGF β signaling down-stream of TGR1 and TGR1 is multifarious and can by action of phosphorylation impact multiple kinases
(via the kinase Transforming Growth Factor-β-activated Kinase (TAK1)) or SMA-mothers against decapentaplegic (Smad) transcription factors. TGF
β signaling is regulated by cytoplasmic kinases (Bone Morphogenic Proteins – not discussed herein), Retinoic Acid-Retinoic Acid Receptor (RAR)
and is important in developmental programs and maintaining an epithelial state. 2: Key developmental pathways are activated by kinase activity
described above or morphogens (Sonic Hedgehog (Shh)-Patched(Ptch)-Gli1; Notch-Jagged(Jag)-Delta-like Ligand (DLL1/4); or Wingless (Wnt)-Frizzled
(Frz)-β-catenin (β-Cat). These canonical developmental pathways activate highly conserved transcriptional programs which center around Snail and
Slug (5) in inducing epithelial to mesenchymal transition. Activation of Snail and Slug result in reduction of E-cadherin and diminution of adherens
junctions and planar cell polarity PCP 3. 3: Reduced and epithelial cell adhesion with concomitant increases in N-Cadherin, loss of apico-basal
orientation, and reorganization of the cytoskeleton via Rho/ROCK kinases (4, not shown) promotes cellular motility, infiltration, and lymphadenopathy.

vasculogenesis) and nerves (axonogenesis; perinerual spreading and invasion). 5: Feedback mechanisms and chromatin modifications by developmental

molecular mechanisms of HPV-mediated immortalization
and tumor progression. Our early studies demonstrated
decreased sensitivity to the growth inhibitory effects of
TGFβ, clearly attributable to a decrease in the expression
of the TGFβ receptor type I [39,73,79-81] during in vitro
progression of HPV16-transformed human keratinocytes
toward a pre-malignant, differentiation-resistant phenotype
(Figure 4).
We and others determined that HPV16 E7 (and pre￾sumably the E7 of other oncogenic HPV types) and
TGFβ exist in a dynamic balance in HPV-transformed
cells: on one side, E7 interferes with TGFβ signaling by a
variety of mechanisms, decreasing overall TGFβ sensitiv￾ity and contributing to a switch from Smad-mediated
(growth inhibitory in human keratinocytes) to non￾canonical modes of TGFβ signaling which induce EMT
in human keratinocytes. On the other side, TGFβ in￾hibits E7 expression by a mechanism involving the activ￾ity of NF1/Ski complexes on the HPV16 upstream
untranslated region (URR) which regulates the expres￾sion of the early region [82,83]. Hence, when canonical
TGFβ signaling is robust, E7 levels are low; E7 levels rise
during progression from HKc/HPV16 to HKc/DR and
this leads to a switch in TGFβ signaling from canonical
(growth inhibitory) to non-canonical (promoting EMT)
[74]. More recently, we linked the switch in TGFβ signal￾ing pathways in HPV16-transformed cells to alterations
of the expression of the homeobox transcription factor
SIX1, linked to invasiveness and aggressive behavior in a
variety of cancers, including cervical cancer [76,78]. SIX1
mRNA and protein levels increase during progression
from HKc/HPV16 to HKc/DR [76,78]. When overex￾pressed in HKc/HPV16, exogenous SIX1 induces EMT
and the DR phenotype (59; Xu et al., Virology, in press).
Forced overexpression of SIX1 in HKc/DR causes pro￾nounced EMT and tumorigenicity [76]. While overex￾pression of SIX1 is clearly detected in a subset of cervical
cancers ([78]; unpublished observations) and is linked
to advanced disease when detected in any solid tumors,
a role for SIX1 in HPV-driven HNC has not yet been
proposed.
The changes associated with the emergence of EMT in
sub-types of HNC – and specifically the role of EMT
mediator TGFβ in inducing these changes – are active
areas of investigation. TGFβ signaling occurs following
ligand binding and heterodimerization of Type I and
Type II TGFβ receptors. A diversity of feedback signal￾ing and endogenous mediators and antagonists greatly
increases the complexity of TGFβ signaling pathways.
Canonical TGFβ signaling is transduced via a complex
of Smad co-receptors present within the cytosol [80].
Smad2/3 are phosphorylated, recruiting Smad4 to form
complexes that translocate to the nucleus where they
interact with a host of co-activators and co-repressors to
activate or repress the expression of target genes [80].
The switch in TGFβ responses from growth-suppressive to
EMT-inducing involves a change from Smad-dependent to
Smad-independent signaling [24] and appears to be a crit￾ical marker of progression in HPV-mediated HNC and
EMT. In addition to SIX1 overexpression as we described
above, the disabled homolog 2 (DAB2) – a recently charac￾terized protein involved in mitogen response – might play
Figure 4 Emerging molecular picture from >25 years of in vitro studies. Our model of keratinocyte transformation following HPV-infection,
transformation, and immortalization supports intrinsic and incremental EMT changes that center around changes in TGFβ, SIX1, and EGF.

a key role in regulating this switch in HNC [84]. Add￾itionally, although not observed in mutational studies,
loss of the tumor suppressor phosphatase and tensin
homology (PTEN) appears to be a mechanism by which
non-canonical TGFβ/Akt1/NFκβ activation manifests in
an animal model [85]. Importantly, increased mutations of
PIK3CA have also been described in HPV-driven HNC
suggesting a potential role for the PI3k/Akt pathway in
HNC [86]. The primary HPV-16 oncogenes (E6 and E7)
have also been demonstrated to up-regulate Slug, TWIST,
and ZEB1/2 with marked increases in ZEB transcription
factors observed [87].
The studies summarized above provide preclinical tar￾gets, which have been considered in the translational
setting. While not highly represented in genome-wide
studies in HNC, genetic variants in TGFβ1 have been
described in a cohort of 200 serum samples from oro￾pharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma [88]. Interestingly,
while the most frequently varied alleles C509T and
G915C were not significant, a 2-fold risk for more ag￾gressive disease was significantly associated with HPV￾16 positive oropharyngeal lesions. These trends were
most common in classically HPV-associated demographics
including non-Hispanic Caucasian patients, younger age at
diagnosis, never smokers and never drinkers. Moreover,
frequent loss of chromosome 18q, which contains Smads
2–4 and TGRII, is observed in HNC and correlates with
clinically observed invasiveness [89].
These studies have been successful in dissecting the
role that HPV plays in induction of EMT and will likely
drive further translational discovery.
EMT predisposing mutations in HNC: emerging genomic,
epigenomic, and transcriptomic evidence
Molecular evidence for specific chromosomal aberra￾tions, mutations, and epigenomic drivers of EMT in
HNC has recently come to light. In addition to specific
targets, these studies lend important insight to the net￾works driving the complex pathology observed in the
HNC patient.
Genomic mutations and EMT
Several studies have demonstrated indirect mutations in
important pathways relevant to EMT. Perhaps the most
direct evidence comes from the recent TCGA Pan-Cancer
analysis. Kandoth and colleagues characterized the pres￾ence of significant mutations in EMT-related genes and
discovered mutations in multiple TGFβ-related pathways
(Smad4: 2%; TGFBR2: 3%; ACVR1B: 1.3%; SMAD2: 1%;
ACVR2A: 0.7% of the 301 HNC tumors sampled) [90].
The study also described mutations in the histone acetyl￾transferase EP300 (8%) and confirmed previous reports of
mutations in Notch1 (19.3%) being highest amongst HNC
tumors [16,90]. Recent evidence has connected EP300
with EMT as a key transcriptional activator of E-Cadherin
and the adherens complex [91]. Notch is a key activa￾tor of EMT downstream of Snail and Slug signaling
[25]. Notch also activates HIF1 to promote Snail ex￾pression in response to hypoxic stress in HNC (discussed
above; Table 1) [92].
Epigenetics and EMT
Epigenetic modulation of key developmental and EMT￾driven pathways is another area of active translational
investigation in HNC. Various studies have demonstrated
epigenetic down-regulation of key epithelial molecules –
such as E-Cadherin. Moreover, as epigenetic sequencing
technology continues to evolve, evidence has shifted to in￾clude critical roles for epigenetic regulators in the biology
of HNC. Recently, it was shown that disabled homolog 2
(DAB2) – a key regulator of the TGFβ-Smad signaling – is
often hypermethylated resulting in aberrant TGFβ2 signal￾ing [84]. The divergence of mutational patterns in HPV￾positive lesions versus HNC-negative lesions and the
presence of lesions with HPV DNA but an absence of
HPV E6/E7 RNA have recently been discovered [93]. Evi￾dence from our laboratory suggests a divergence of gene
expression in these types (Tomar et al. submitted). Fur￾thermore, consideration of the epigenetic differences in
HNC has yielded discernable methylation patterns between
HPVdna+/rna+ versus HPVdna+/rna- and HPVdna-/rna- [17]. It
is possible that these epigenetic sequelae preempt down￾stream mutations observed in HNC – especially when con￾sidering tobacco use. Associations between HPV-activity
and specific gene expression patterns have been described
in HNC tumors. In HPVdna+/rna- and HPVdna-/rna-, the most
up-regulated gene ontologies were key to EMT path￾ways and included TGFβ and β-Catenin Pathways [38,94]
(Figure 5).
Gene expression changes and EMT
Alteration of the expression of genes commonly associ￾ated with EMT have been directly observed in HNC
over the past decade. First suggested by early gene
expression studies, these findings are now being trans￾lated into relevant clinical associations with patient￾based gene expression assays [38,95,96]. Walter et al.
recently described a 9 gene mesenchymal subtype discov￾ered in a validation study of 138 patients [19]. This
accounted for one fifth of the entire RNA-sequenced co￾hort and the 9 genes that defined it were associated with
EMT centering around the transcription factor TWIST,
hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), and vimentin - markers
of mesenchymal phenotype. While there was no statisti￾cally significant difference in survival – likely due to the
small sample size per sub-type – it was suggested that
these tumors might be expected to have increased locore￾gional metastasis.

MiRNAs, post-transcriptional modifications and EMT
A great deal of interest has been focused on the involve￾ment of neutralizing noncoding RNAs since their dis￾covery in early 1990’s [97]. Specifically, microRNAs
(miRs) have attracted attention as potential therapeutic
targets. It was recently suggested that the miR-200 cluster
was responsible for targeted EGFR-inhibitor resistance in
HNC [98]. Furthermore, a miR profile characterized by
reduced miR-345 and elevated miR-1 was found to be pre￾dictive of poor metastasis-free survival in a 64 patient co￾hort [99]. It will be of great interest to synergize miRNA
profiles with the genomic and epigenomic mutational
spectrum in HNC for the identification of novel specific
therapeutic targets.
Another emerging paradigm in EMT is the importance
of alternative splicing in cell adhesion molecules often
aberrantly expressed in invasive disease. The hyaluronic
acid receptor (CD44) has gained extensive attention due
to an emerging pattern of exon splicing in HNC [100].
Analysis of the dominant three isoforms CD44 v3, v6,
and v10 demonstrated enhanced stage (v3 & v6), reduced
overall survival (v6 & v10), and increased regional, distant,
and perineural invasion, respectively [101]. Furthermore,
laminin alpha variant 3 (LAMA3) was recently discovered
to carry prognostic significance in HNC in a cohort of
59 patients [102]. This variant was validated in a cohort
of 44 HNC specimens where dystonin (DST), a plaque
cell adhesion molecule, as also discovered [103]. An￾other splice variant, the nuclear protein 63 delta variant
alpha (ΔNP63α) will also be of great translational inter￾est given the involvement in epithelial stem cell biology
and EMT [104,105].
Taken together, incorporation of tissue driven molecular
analysis of the sub-type specific drivers and mutational
spectrum in HNC and EMT offers great translational po￾tential. Activating mutations in PIK3CA and NOTCH1
have emerging agents (XL147, BEZ325, and GDC-0941
(PIK3CA) and OMP-52 M51 (NOTCH1) and might be
potential therapeutic targets.
Surrogate end-points and clinically actionable biomarkers
of EMT in HNC
The need for clinically actionable markers of locoregio￾nal invasion and metastasis at diagnosis and for prog￾nostic markers of recurrence is pressing in HNC. Given
the accessibility of the aerodigestive tract, saliva provides
Figure 5 Divergence of EMT-driven disease in HPV-positive versus HPV-negative HNC. Gene Ontogeny (GO) pathway analysis demonstrates
an increased reliance on EMT-related pro-infiltrative growth in HPV-negative disease. B: This observation is supported by an increase in TGFβ in

a rational matrix for assessment of these markers. Most
studies to date have focused on tissue- and serum-based
approaches to assess changes in EMT-related cytokines,
growth factors, and genes. Classic markers of EMT (TGFβ
and downstream genes Smad2/6/7 and MMP9) have been
described in several studies to correlate with patient
survival, locoregional invasion, and therapeutic response
[106,107]. A recent study described TGFβ as a prognostic
serum biomarker in HNC [108]. Additionally, PLAU and
insulin-like growth factor binding protein 7 (IGFBP7) were
found to be increased 1.5- and an impressive 35-fold, re￾spectively, by plasma ELISA in HNC patients versus
healthy volunteers [109]. Other correlations with markers
of invasiveness, including matrix metalloproteinase 13
(MMP13) and MMP1, have also been detected in tissue
and saliva [110]. Lallemant and colleagues, using a quanti￾tative PCR approach in saliva, validated MMP1 as a spe￾cific marker at 100% but a low specificity of 20% [111].
Incorporation of soluble CD44 (sCD44), hyaluronic acid,
and interleukin-8 in addition to total protein was found to
have a sensitivity ranging from 75 to 82.5% and a specifi￾city of 69.2-82.1% [112]. Additional screening for the three
dominant CD44 exon variants as well as those recently
validated in LAMA3 and DST as described above might
also yield biomarkers with clinical relevance [103]. Evalu￾ated extensively in epithelial cell and stem cell biology in
lung cancer, ΔNP63α is emerging as a predictive bio￾marker in HNC in premalignant oral preneoplastic lesions
[105]. While it will be of great interest to determine the
role the cancer stem-like marker CD44 and ΔNP63α play
in prognosis much remains to be elucidated regarding the
overlap of these markers with EMT.
Many of these attempts to derive biomarkers are sup￾ported by isolated center-driven studies that sample a
small population. These studies will invariably necessi￾tate consortium-driven biomarker trials with the most
promising of these EMT surrogate endpoints to produce
the most meaningful translational benefits.
Emerging potential EMT therapeutic targets in HNC
The modern armamentarium of targeted therapies in HNC
has greatly expanded with the addition of molecular-based
profiling and tumor sub-typing. Currently approved mo￾lecular targeted therapy Cetuximab has added epidermal
growth factor receptor (EGFR), a known EMT-inducer in
HNC, to the formulary [5]. However, the incomplete re￾sponse rates of this novel therapeutic confirm the complex
heterogeneity of HNC. As EMT accounts for extensive
morbidity and varying therapeutic responses, several plaus￾ible targets and appealing regimens have emerged.
Strategies targeting fibroblast growth factor receptor 1
(FGFR1) via the non-selective receptor tyrosine kinase
inhibitor PD173074 have provided promising preclinical
results [113]. This novel strategy functionally reverses the
EMT and induces a reciprocal mesenchymal-epithelial
transition (MET) reducing Snail and Slug down-stream
of AP-1 enhancement. This approach is made more ap￾pealing when considering that fibroblast growth factor
(FGF) ligands are necessary for the maintenance of EMT
phenotypes [114].
Other groups have targeted the inflammatory drivers
upstream of EMT induction to achieve reduction in
metastatic potential. Fujii and colleagues reported use of
Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors – colecoxib, NS-398
and SC-91 – to increase E-Cadherin and reduce EMT￾mediators (TWIST, Snail, SIP1) [69]. Dedifferentiation strat￾egies targeting aberrant EMT-inducing Wnt and TGFβ
signaling have also been suggested in preclinical studies
using patient-derived tumor stem cells. For example, and
colleagues provided an interesting approach using all-trans￾retinoic acid, an inhibitor of TGFβ, and demonstrated re￾ductions in β-Catenin and tumor growth [115].

Direct targeting of TGFβ signaling has proven difficult
in other malignancies, due to the complexity in targeting
overlapping and conserved pathways that are so import￾ant for tissue and immunological homeostasis. Various
biologics and RTKIs have entered clinical trials in solid
malignancies but no specific HNC trials have com￾menced to date [116]. Another potential limitation of
these trials in HNC comes in the form of their design as
they often target late stage and recalcitrant disease. It
will be of great interest to establish validated biomarker￾driven trials in HNC to assess objective responses to
these multivalent therapeutic targets.
Searches for synergistic drug combinations in inflam￾matory and cellular signaling pathways carry immense
potential for therapeutic interventions. Inhibitors of NFκβ
(such as bortezomib) have entered clinical trials and found
to be ineffective as monotherapies; however, combinatorial
approaches combining targeted anti-inflammatory small
molecules with RTKIs present opportunities in personaliz￾ing pharmacology to the emerging HNC sub-types [117].
Additionally, targeting strategies which incorporate tar￾geted RTKI’s with conventional chemoirradiation models
offer promise in the preclinical pipeline.
To this end, studies from the Kupferman group have
indicated an important role for BDNF-TrkB in chemore￾sistance to standard of care platinum regimen [67]. In
preclinical studies, inhibition of TrkB by AZ64, a 4-amino
pyrazolylpyrimidine, in combination with Cisplatin re￾duced tumor growth in cell line screening [118]. It will be
of interest to see if other neurotrophin RTKIs currently
available in the clinical pipeline hold potential as adjuvants
or in combinatorial approaches [clinical trials.gov] of pan￾receptor inhibitors in clinical trials such as PLX7486,
Lestaurtinib, TSR-01, or RXDX-101 Table 2.
Targeting of stem-like cells is another strategy that has
also been explored in Phase I clinical trials. The biologic
bivatuzumab-mertansine has recently been explored as
an anti-stem cell agent in HNC [120]. Bivatuzumab, a
CD44v6- targeting antibody conjugated with the may￾tansinoid cytotoxin mertansine (also known by DM1),
was recently shown to be well-tolerated in a dose￾escalation study of 31 patients with recurrent or meta￾static HNC [121]. However, despite accurate targeting of
the therapeutic to CD44, this trial was terminated due to
graded dose-related dermal toxicities.
Conclusions
EMT in Head and Neck cancers continues to attract sig￾nificant translational attention. The need to synergize
preclinical science with relevant pathologic staging and
prognosis remains a challenge. As the basic science and
molecular pathways continue to evolve, the potential
promise of novel therapeutic targets and improved pa￾tient outcomes stand to be realized.
