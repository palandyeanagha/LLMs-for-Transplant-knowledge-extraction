ABSTRACT
Background How different Global Initiative for Chronic
Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) classifications of
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) predict
mortality is unclear.
Objective To examine the association of spirometric
GOLD grades and the new ABCD groups with mortality,
and to compare their informativeness in relation to
mortality.
Methods We studied 1540 people with post￾bronchodilator COPD who participated in the Norwegian
Nord-Trøndelag Health Study 1995–1997 and were
followed up on all-cause mortality until May 2012. The
associations of spirometric GOLD grades and ABCD
groups with mortality were estimated by sex specific
adjusted HRs from Cox regression and standardised
mortality ratios. To assess the informativeness of
spirometric GOLD grades and ABCD groups at predicting
mortality we used the difference in twice the log￾likelihood of a Cox regression model with and without
each COPD classification.
Results The distribution of participants was 28% in
GOLD 1, 57% in GOLD 2, 13% in GOLD 3 and 2% in
GOLD 4, in contrast to 61% in group A, 18% in group
B, 12% in group C and 10% in group D. During a
median of 14.6 years of follow-up, 837 people (54%)
died. Mortality increased gradually from GOLD 1 to 4,
while it was generally similar in groups A and B, and in
groups C and D. Spirometric GOLD grades were
substantially more informative than ABCD groups at
predicting mortality.
Conclusions Spirometric GOLD grades predicted
mortality better than the new ABCD groups among
people with COPD from a Norwegian general
population.
INTRODUCTION
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a
major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide1
and it is estimated to be the fourth leading cause of
death by 2030.2 According to the Global Initiative
for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD), a
diagnosis of COPD should be based on post￾bronchodilator spirometric measurements, and the
severity should be graded based on per cent pre￾dicted forced expiratory volume in 1 s
(ppFEV1).3 4
However, the 2011 revision of the GOLD strategy
document presented a new ABCD group classification
of COPD which intended to provide a better
understanding of the impact of the disease on an indi￾vidual patient than spirometric GOLD grades.3 4 The
ABCD groups combine symptom burden and risk of
exacerbations, where the latter is estimated from the
spirometric GOLD grades and the number of exacer￾bations in the last year.3 4 The association of spiro￾metric GOLD grades and ABCD groups with
mortality has been examined in two recent studies.5 6
In the first study, both pre-bronchodilator spirometric
GOLD grades and ABCD groups predicted mortality
in a general population in Denmark, but which
measure best predicted mortality was not formally
tested.5 In this Danish study, survival was poorer in
people with relatively high lung function and dys￾pnoea compared with people with lower lung function
without dyspnoea.5 In the second study, pooled data
from 11 Spanish COPD cohorts showed no difference
between post-bronchodilator spirometric GOLD
grades and ABCD groups in predicting mortality.6
We aimed to examine the association of spiro￾metric GOLD grades and the new ABCD groups
with mortality, and to compare their informative￾ness in relation to mortality.
METHODS
Study population
From August 1995 to June 1997, all residents in
Nord-Trøndelag County in Norway aged 19 years or
older were invited to participate in the second wave of
the Nord-Trøndelag Health Study (HUNT2).7 Among
Key messages
What is the key question?
▸ Which of the spirometric Global Initiative for
Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD)
grades or the new ABCD groups is the better
predictor of mortality in chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (COPD)?
What is the bottom line?
▸ Spirometric GOLD grades predicted mortality
better than the new ABCD groups.
Why read on?
▸ This is the first population-based study
evaluating which of the spirometric GOLD
grades or the new ABCD groups is the better
predictor of mortality in people with COPD.

the 65 237 participants (69.5% of those invited), a 5% random
sample and a symptom sample were invited to participate in the
Lung Study.8 9 Briefly, the symptom sample included participants
reporting attacks of wheezing or breathlessness during the last
12 months, having ever had asthma and/or having ever used asthma
medication, and who were not included in the random sample. As
described elsewhere,10 a β2-agonist reversibility test was performed
on a subsample of the 10 491 Lung Study participants with accept￾able pre-bronchodilator spirometry. Among 5144 participants with
complete data on post-bronchodilator FEV1 and forced vital cap￾acity (FVC), the 1540 participants with post-bronchodilator FEV1/
FVC <0.70 comprised the study cohort (figure 1).
Study variables
At participation in HUNT2, questionnaire information was col￾lected on a range of lifestyle and health related factors, and all
participants underwent a clinical examination.7 The Lung Study
participants completed an additional lung specific questionnaire,
an interview and flow volume spirometry.9
Lung function and spirometric GOLD grades
Flow volume spirometry was recorded according to the 1994
American Thoracic Society recommendations11 as described else￾where.9 Spirometry was performed before and 30 min after inhal￾ation of 1 mg terbutaline.10 Pre- and post-bronchodilator FEV1
and FVC were obtained, and the prediction equations of
Langhammer et al9 were used to calculate ppFEV1.
Post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC <0.70 defined COPD, and airflow
limitation was graded according to GOLD criteria as GOLD 1
(ppFEV1 ≥80), GOLD 2 (50≤ ppFEV1 <80), GOLD 3 (30≤
ppFEV1 <50) and GOLD 4 (ppFEV1 <30).3 4

ABCD groups
We generated ABCD groups based on symptom burden and
exacerbation risk according to the 2011 GOLD strategy docu￾ment.3 4 According to GOLD,3 4 symptom burden should be
measured by the modified Medical Research Council (mMRC)
dyspnoea scale12 or the COPD Assessment Test (CAT),13 and
exacerbation risk by the GOLD grades of airflow limitation or
exacerbation history. The ABCD group classification is based on
a 2×2 table with cells labelled A, B, C and D. Symptom burden
is divided into low (A and C) and high (B and D), whereas
airflow limitation and/or exacerbation history separates A from
C, and B from D. Regarding the latter, patients should be placed
in the group that gives the highest exacerbation risk according
to airflow limitation (ppFEV1 <50) or exacerbation history (≥2
last year).3 4 In the current study, symptom burden was mea￾sured by a dyspnoea scale included in the lung specific question￾naire (22% missing data).8 14 15 We used a cut-off on ‘Do you
become short of breath when walking on flat ground at a
normal pace?’ which approximates to dyspnoea grade 2 accord￾ing to the mMRC dyspnoea scale.12 Airflow limitation was
graded as described above. Exacerbation history (≤1, ≥2 last
year) was generated from two questions; ‘Have you ever taken
cortisone tablets for breathing problems/asthma?’ and ‘How
many cortisone courses have you taken in the last year?’ Among
participants with data on the dyspnoea scale, four people
(0.2%) had missing data on exacerbation history, and these were
placed in an exacerbation risk group based on their spirometric
GOLD grade.
Follow-up
The study cohort was followed from the date of attendance in
HUNT2 to the date of death or emigration, or the end of
follow-up, 24 May 2012, whichever came first. There were no
other losses to follow-up. The outcome was all-cause mortality,
and date of death was obtained from the Cause of Death
Registry in Norway.
Statistical analyses
Baseline characteristics were presented according to spirometric
GOLD grades and ABCD groups. Most statistical analyses were
sex specific because women and men differ in many ways
including hormonal and immunological determinants,16 percep￾tion and reporting of symptoms,16 17 and exposure to cigarette
smoke or other noxious particles and gasses.4 Death rates per
1000 person-years were calculated for spirometric GOLD
grades and ABCD groups. We also calculated standardised mor￾tality ratios (SMRs) with 95% CIs using the Norwegian popula￾tion death rates as reference.18 These death rates were presented
separately for women and men, 5-year age bands (20–24, …,
85–89, ≥90), and 5-year calendar periods (1991–1995, …,
2006–2010, 2011). By sorting our data in the same way we cal￾culated the expected number of deaths within spirometric
GOLD grades and ABCD groups in our study cohort. SMRs
were obtained when comparing the observed to the expected
number of deaths. Unadjusted Kaplan–Meier curves with time
of follow-up as the time scale were generated in order to visual￾ise mortality trends according to spirometric GOLD grades and
ABCD groups.
Cox proportional hazard regression was used to compute
HRs with 95% CIs for the association of spirometric GOLD
grades and ABCD groups with mortality. All associations were
adjusted for potential confounding by age (as the time scale),19
smoking (current, former, never, unknown (4.5%)), and
education (<10, ≥10 years, unknown (8.7%)) as identified
through directed acyclic graphs.20 21 In separate models we also
assessed possible confounding by body mass index (BMI)
(<18.5, 18.5–24.9, 25.0–29.9, ≥30.0 kg/m2
), physical activity
(inactive, light activity <1 h/week, light activity 1–2 h/week,
light activity ≥3 h/week, only vigorous activity, unknown
(3.1%)), cardiovascular disease (CVD) (yes, no), diabetes melli￾tus (DM) (yes, no), total cholesterol (sex specific quartiles;
mmol/l), and systolic blood pressure (SBP) (sex specific quar￾tiles; mm Hg). Departures from the proportional hazard
assumptions were evaluated by inspecting log-log survival curves
for each covariate, calculating Schoenfeld residuals and produ￾cing formal tests of interaction with time or log time.
To study how well spirometric GOLD grades and ABCD
groups predicted mortality, we estimated their informativeness
according to the method described by Peto et al22 and later
used by others.23–25 The informativeness was computed as the
difference in twice the log-likelihood between a Cox propor￾tional hazard null model (including age as the time scale,
smoking and education) and an alternative model (including
spirometric GOLD grades or ABCD groups in addition to all
in the null model). This difference approximately follows a χ2
distribution. The greater the difference, the more informative
is that particular predictor. To help compare models, we set
the most informative model to 100% and compared the other
model with this reference. Additionally, we analysed the area
under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and the
pseudo R2 from logistic regression models including the same
variables as presented above.
In subsequent sensitivity analyses we generated ABCD groups
with three alternate measures of symptom burden. First, ‘Have
you had any kind of attack of wheezing or breathlessness during
the last 12 months?’ (no missing data). Second, ‘Have you at
any time in the last 12 months been short of breath when
resting during the day?’ (0.2% missing data). ‘No’ was regarded
as low and ‘yes’ as high symptom burden. Third, ‘How is your
health at the moment?’ (0.8% missing data). ‘Good/very good’
were regarded as low and ‘poor/not so good’ as high symptom
burden.
Statistical analyses were conducted using Stata V.12.1. All stat￾istical tests were two-sided.
Ethics
The Regional Committee for Medical Research Ethics (reference
4.2008.59) approved the study, and the Norwegian Data
Inspectorate licensed the research register (reference 06/
00104-39/CGN). All participants signed informed written
consents.
RESULTS
Baseline characteristics and distribution of participants
In this prospective cohort study of 1540 people with COPD, 837
people (54%) died during a median of 14.6 years (18 150
person-years) of follow-up. Baseline characteristics are presented
in table 1. When classified by spirometric GOLD grade, the dis￾tribution of participants was 28% in GOLD 1, 57% in GOLD 2,
13% in GOLD 3 and 2% in GOLD 4. In contrast, when classified
by ABCD group, the distribution of participants was 61% in
group A, 18% in group B, 12% in group C and 10% in group D.
Spirometric GOLD grades and ABCD groups in association
with mortality
Compared to GOLD 1 or the general population, mortality
increased with higher spirometric GOLD grade (table 2).

Compared to group A, women in groups C and D and men in
group D had increased mortality. Compared to the general
population, women and men in most ABCD groups had
increased mortality. In general, mortality did not differ substan￾tially between groups A and B, and between groups C and
D. Further adjustments for BMI, physical activity, CVD, DM,
total cholesterol and SBP did not materially change the estimates
(data not shown). The sensitivity analyses with alternate mea￾sures of dyspnoea or health status supported our main findings
(see online supplementary table S1 for women and online
supplementary table S2 for men).
The unadjusted Kaplan–Meier curves demonstrated large dif￾ferences in survival between the four spirometric GOLD grades
among women and men (figure 2). Among women, there were
small differences in survival between groups A and B, and
between groups C and D (figure 3). In contrast, survival was
lower among men in group B compared to A, and in group D
compared to C (figure 3).
Informativeness
Spirometric GOLD grades were more informative than ABCD
groups at predicting mortality (table 3). These findings were
supported by the additional analyses of AUC and pseudo R2
(see online supplementary table S3) and the sensitivity analyses
with alternate measures of dyspnoea or health status (see online
supplementary tables S4 and S5).
DISCUSSION
Among participants with COPD in the Norwegian HUNT2
Lung Study, spirometric GOLD grades predicted mortality
better than ABCD groups. Mortality increased gradually from
GOLD 1 to 4, while it was similar in group A compared to B,
and in group C compared to D.
Spirometric GOLD grades and ABCD groups in association
with mortality
In accordance with other epidemiological studies,5 26–28 mortality
increased with higher spirometric GOLD grade in the current
study. In general, our study showed similar mortality in groups
A and B, and in groups C and D, which may indicate that
symptom burden does not influence mortality substantially. In
support of this, we observed that the choice of symptom burden
instrument did not affect our findings. The unadjusted Kaplan–
Meier curves indicated that reporting dyspnoea when walking
might be associated with lower survival in men but not in women.
However, these curves must be interpreted with caution since pos￾sible confounders like age, smoking and education were more
unfavourable among people in group B compared to A, and in
group D compared to C.
A likely explanation of the small differences in mortality
between groups A and B, and between groups C and D, may be
that ppFEV1 is dichotomised at 50 in the ABCD classification,
resulting in less discrimination between people with different
lung function. Hence, symptom burden may still be associated

with mortality despite our findings. Studying over 10 000
people from HUNT2, we recently found dyspnoea to be inde￾pendently associated with mortality within four levels of pre￾bronchodilator ppFEV1.
15 In order to add possible predictive
value of symptom burden without losing predictive value from
lung function, we suggest keeping all four spirometric GOLD
grades in the combined COPD assessment in the next revision
of the GOLD strategy document.
In contrast to the current study, Lange et al5 found poorer sur￾vival in group B compared to group C in people with pre￾bronchodilator COPD from the general population of Denmark,
and they suggested CVD or cancer as possible explanations. Since
most analyses were unadjusted, their results may have been
biased by confounding factors. In addition, the average follow-up
was 4.3 years, and it is possible that the associations will change
with longer follow-up. In a pooled analysis of 11 COPD cohorts,
Soriano et al6 found no difference between post-bronchodilator
spirometric GOLD grades and ABCD groups in predicting mor￾tality during almost 16 000 person-years. Neither Lange et al5
nor Soriano et al6 performed sex specific analyses. In the current
study, group B consisted of 21% of the women and 16% of the
men, while group C consisted of 9% of the women and 14% of
the men. This different distribution between sexes may reflect
that women tend to report symptoms more often than men.16 17

Informativeness
We observed that spirometric GOLD grades predicted mortality
substantially better than ABCD groups, and this reflected the
HRs and SMRs from the association analyses discussed above.
Although symptom burden and exacerbation history may impact
the choice of treatment and quality of life of people with
COPD,3 4 our results indicate that the prognostic information
given by the four spirometric GOLD grades should not be
neglected when predicting mortality in people with COPD.
Methodological considerations
Since several analytical methods were used to disentangle our
data, and they all led to similar interpretations of the results, we
considered our findings robust. Our population-based study had
a wide age span, and we had sufficient power to do sex specific
analyses.16 Data on mortality were complete due to the unique
personal identification number of all inhabitants of Norway, and
there were no losses to follow-up. Since we included people
based on lung function, both people with and without a phys￾ician diagnosis of COPD were included. Han et al29 recently
studied the risk of future exacerbations according to the ABCD
groups in 45–80 year-old people with COPD attending clinical
centres in the USA. When using the mMRC dyspnoea scale to
measure symptom burden, the distribution of participants dif￾fered considerably from our post-bronchodilator distribution
and from the pre-bronchodilator distribution of the Danish epi￾demiological study,5 while the Spanish study of 11 COPD
cohorts6 had a more similar distribution to Han et al.
29 This
difference in distribution may reflect that patients with a phys￾ician diagnosis of COPD got their diagnosis because they experi￾enced symptoms and therefore visited their doctor, although the
inclusion criteria differed between these studies.5 6 29
A limitation of the current study was the lack of data on the
mMRC dyspnoea scale12 or the CAT.13 However, our dyspnoea
cut-off question was not very different from the mMRC dys￾pnoea scale grade 2 question.12 Since using alternate measures
of dyspnoea or health status did not alter our findings and since
the association with mortality seemed to be mostly related to
lung function, we assume that using the mMRC dyspnoea scale
or the CAT in generating the ABCD groups would not change
our findings. Future studies on the association between ABCD
groups and mortality using different cut-offs of the mMRC dys￾pnoea scale,12 the CAT13 30 or other measures of symptom
burden in generating the ABCD groups are needed. Further,
22% of our participants had missing data on the dyspnoea
scale. However, it is unlikely that this has biased our results
since using alternate measures of dyspnoea or health status with
little or no missing data did not materially change our results. In
addition, we have previously shown that baseline characteristics
did not differ materially between people with and without data
on the dyspnoea scale.15
CONCLUSIONS
Spirometric GOLD grades predicted mortality better than the
new ABCD groups. In contrast to spirometric GOLD grades
where mortality increased with higher grade, there were only
minor differences in mortality between groups A and B, and
between groups C and D. Our study supports the use of spiro￾metric GOLD grades over the use of the new ABCD groups for
predicting mortality.
