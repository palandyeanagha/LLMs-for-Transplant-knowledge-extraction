Hepatitis E virus (HEV), particularly zoonotic genotype 3, is present in environmental
waters worldwide, especially in industrialized countries. Thus, monitoring the presence
of HEV in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) is an emerging topic due to the
importance of reusing water on a global level. Given the limited data, this study aimed to
monitor the occurrence of HEV in influent and effluent water in waste- and drinking￾water treatment plants (WWTPs and DWTPs). To this end, different procedures to
concentrate HEV in influent and effluent water from WWTPs and DWTPs were initially
evaluated. The evaluated procedures resulted in average HEV recoveries of 15.2, 19.9,
and 16.9% in influent, effluent, and drinking water samples, respectively, with detection
limits ranging from 103
to 104
international units (IU)/L. Then, a one-year pilot study was
performed to evaluate the performance of the selected concentration method coupled
with three RT-qPCR assays in influent and effluent water samples from four different
WWTPs. HEV prevalence in influent water varied based on both the RT-qPCR assay
and WWTP, while HEV was not detected in effluent water samples. In addition, HEV
prevalence using only RT-qPCR3 was evaluated in influent (n = 62) and effluent samples
(n = 52) from four WWTPs as well as influent (n = 28) and effluent (n = 28) waters
from two DWTPs. The present study demonstrated that HEV circulated in the Valencian
region at around 30.65% with average concentrations of 6.3 × 103
IU/L. HEV was only
detected in influent wastewater samples, effluent samples from WWTPs and influent
and effluent samples from DWTPs were negative. However, given that the infective
dose in waterborne epidemics settings is not yet known and the low sensibility of the
assay, unfortunately, no direct conclusion could be achieved on the risk assessment of
environmental contamination.

INTRODUCTION
Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a human enteric virus that mainly causes self-limiting acute viral
hepatitis. According to the World Health Organization, 20 million cases of hepatitis E and
44,000 deaths occur worldwide every year1
. HEV is an emerging foodborne pathogen (Harrison
and DiCaprio, 2018), and the incidence of confirmed cases in the European Union has steadily
increased over the last decade (Kupferschmidt, 2016; Ricci et al., 2017).

GRAPHICAL ABSTRACT | Method performance and HEV prevalence in waters.
Hepatitis E infections are caused by a small (27–34 nm),
positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus (approx. 7.2 kb size)
that belongs to the Hepeviridae family (Sooryanarain and Meng,
2019; Van der Poel and Rzezutka, 2019). HEV is excreted in
feces as non-enveloped virions but circulates in the blood in a
membrane-associated, quasi-enveloped form (Yin et al., 2016).
HEV is classified into eight genotypes, of which genotype 1 (G1)
and G2 are specific to humans. HEV G3, G4, and G7 are zoonotic
genotypes that infect humans and animals and have been isolated
in different animal species, especially in pigs (Van der Poel, 2014;
Sooryanarain and Meng, 2019). The different HEV genotypes
have different geographical distributions2
. For example, HEV
G1 and G2 are predominantly transmitted via the fecal-oral
route in Asia, Africa, and Central America, usually through the
consumption of contaminated drinking water (Khuroo et al.,
2016; Van der Poel and Rzezutka, 2019). In contrast, HEV G3
and G4 are endemic in industrialized countries and transmitted
primarily via the consumption of animal meats or direct contact
with infected animals (Sooryanarain and Meng, 2019).
Hepatitis E virus transmission to humans through water
has been largely demonstrated for HEV G1 and G2, primarily
in developing countries, but transmission is also suspected
for the zoonotic genotypes since HEV G3 and G4 have been
detected in different types of environmental waters (Miura et al.,
2016; Haramoto et al., 2018; Fenaux et al., 2019; Van der Poel
and Rzezutka, 2019). Given the authorities’ concerns, several
surveillance studies conducted in different geographic regions
have assessed the presence of HEV in urban wastewater with
2https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/hev/hevfaq.htm
highly variable occurrence (Fenaux et al., 2019). However, few
studies have focused on effluent wastewater or drinking water
(Fenaux et al., 2019; Purpari et al., 2019; Van der Poel and
Rzezutka, 2019). In addition, available data must be interpreted
with caution due to the lack of standardized HEV detection
procedures and the substantial differences among studies in
terms of volume of samples, concentration methods, and RT￾qPCR (Fenaux et al., 2019).
To overcome these challenges, this study initially evaluated
the performances of different concentration methods, RNA
extraction kits, and RT-qPCR protocols in detecting and
quantifying HEV in influent and effluent wastewater samples
as well as in drinking water samples (Graphical Abstract).
After method evaluation, the presence of HEV was monitored
in influent and effluent waters from four municipal wastewater
treatment plants (WWTPs) and two drinking water treatment
plants (DWTPs) in the metropolitan region of Valencia (Spain).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Virus Strains
Fecal sample containing HEV genotype 3f was used in the
study. Fecal sample (10% wt/vol) was suspended in phosphate￾buffered saline (PBS) containing 2 M NaNO3 (Panreac), 1%
beef extract (Conda), and 0.1% Triton X-100 (Thermo Fisher
Scientific) (pH 7.2). The mix was then vigorously vortexed
and centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 5 min to obtain a final
10% (wt/vol) fecal suspension. The supernatant was stored
at −80◦C in aliquots. The first WHO international standard

for HEV nucleic acid amplification technique (NAT)-based
assays (code 6329/10) was purchased from Paul-Ehrlich-Institut
(Germany). This standard corresponds to HEV genotype
3a positive plasma measured in international units (IU)
and containing 250,000 IU/mL and it was used for RT￾qPCR quantification, as detailed below (Baylis et al., 2013).
Mengovirus (MgV) vMC0 (CECT 100000) was used as a
process control.
Sampling Sites
Influent and effluent water samples were collected from four
WWTPs and two DWTPs located in the Valencian region,
Spain (Figure 1). The collected samples were transferred to
the laboratory immediately, and subsequently concentrated as
described below.
Concentration Procedure Comparison in
Influent Wastewater
Influent water samples collected from WWTP1 were artificially
inoculated with 5 log IU/L of HEV and 7 log PCRU/L of MgV,
spiked as process control.
Initially, the performance of two concentration methods was
evaluated: an ultracentrifugation-based method (referred as UC)
and an aluminum hydroxide adsorption-precipitation method
(referred as Al). For UC method, 35 mL of influent water were
centrifuged at 141,000 × g for 2 h 30 min at 4◦C. The pellet
was then incubated on ice for 30 min with 5 mL of 0.25 N
glycine buffer (pH 9.5) and then the solution neutralized with
19 mL of PBS. Suspended solids were removed by centrifugation
at 12,000 × g for 15 min. Viruses were finally recovered by
ultracentrifugation at 505,000 × g for 1 h at 4◦C and subsequently
eluted in 1 mL of PBS (Rodríguez-Díaz et al., 2009).
For Al method, 35 mL of influent water were adjusted to pH
6.0 and Al(OH)3 precipitate formed by adding 1 part 0.9N AlCl3
solution to 100 parts of sample. The pH was readjusted to 6.0 and
sample mixed using an orbital shaker at 150 rpm for 15 min at
room temperature. Then, viruses were collected by centrifugation
at 1,700 × g for 20 min. The pellet was resuspended in 1.75 mL
of 3% beef extract pH 7.4, and samples were shaken for 10 min
at 150 rpm. Concentrate was recovered by centrifugation at
1,900 × g for 30 min and pellet resuspended in 1 mL of PBS
(AAVV, 2018; Randazzo et al., 2019) and stored at −80◦C.
Experiments were performed in duplicate.
Detection Limit in Influent and Effluent
Wastewater
The limit of detection (LoD95%) was obtained by artificially
inoculating HEV at 5, 4, 3, and 2 log IU/L in 35 mL for influent
water or in 200 mL for effluent water.
Samples were spiked with MgV (7 log PCRU/L) as a process
control. Then, virus particles were concentrated by the previously
described Al method and RNA extracted using two kits and
analyzed by RT-qPCR1 and RT-qPCR2 (detailed below). For each
method and contamination level, a PBS sample without influent
or effluent water were included to assess potential matrix effects.
Experiments were performed in duplicate by concentrating two
independent samples for each condition tested.
Concentration Procedure Comparison
and Detection Limit in Drinking Water
Drinking water samples (20 L) were artificially inoculated with
HEV at 7, 6, 5, and 4 log IU/L. In addition, MgV was spiked
and used as process control. HEV primary concentration was
performed by a Dead End Hollow Fiber Ultrafiltration (DEUF)
using single-use Rexeed-25A dialysis filters (Asahi Kasei Medical

Co., Ltd.) with a molecular mass cutoff of 30 kDa, a surface area
of 2.5 m2
, a fiber inner diameter of 185 µm and a priming volume
of 137 mL (Borgmästars et al., 2017). A peristaltic pump (model
FH100, Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used for all experiments.
In brief, the Rexeed-25A filters were blocked with 6.25% fetal
bovine serum by circulating the blocking solution for 5 min
followed by 2 h incubation at room temperature. Afterward, filter
was properly assembled and flushed with 1 L of sterile water at
2,900 mL/min and then with the 20 L of inoculated drinking
water samples. Subsequently, filter was assembled for a back-flush
elution with 500 mL of sterile water supplemented with 0.001%
Antifoam, 0.01% NaPP, and 0.01% Tween 80.
Two different approaches were evaluated for secondary
concentration: a precipitation with polyethylene glycol (PEG)
and a centrifuge filtration procedure by AmiconR Ultra-15
tubes (Merck Millipore Ltd.). For PEG precipitation, 300 mL
of concentrate were transferred to two 250 mL centrifugation
tubes, 150 mL of eluate for each tube. Then, 2 g of
beef extract (Laboratorio Conda) were added into each tube
and shaken until completely dissolved. Then, 50 mL of
PEG/NaCl 5× were added and incubated overnight at 4◦C
in an orbital shaker at 150 rpm. Finally, the samples were
centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min and resulting pellets
resuspended in 1 mL PBS.
For secondary concentration by centrifuge filtration, 15 mL
volume was added to AmiconR Ultra-15 tube and concentrated
via centrifugation at 4,000 × g for 15 min. This step was
repeated three times using the same ultrafilter for a total of
45 mL sample processed. Then the concentrated viruses were
recovered in 1 mL PBS. The viral concentrates were stored at
−80◦C until further processed. Experiments were performed in
duplicate by concentrating two independent samples for each
condition tested.
RNA Extraction and RT-qPCR Assays
Two different commercial extraction kits were used for RNA
extraction. The extraction using the NucleoSpinR RNA virus
kit (Macherey-Nagel GmbH & Co.) (referred as MN) was
performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions with
some modifications. Briefly, 150 µL of each concentrated
sample was mixed with 25 µL Plant RNA Isolation Aid
(Ambion) and 600 µL of lysis buffer from the NucleoSpinR
RNA virus kit and subjected to pulse-vortexing for 1 min.
Afterward, the homogenate was centrifuged for 5 min at
10,000 × g to remove the debris. The supernatant was
subsequently processed according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. An additional extraction was carried out using the
NucliSENSR miniMAGR
system (BioMérieux SA) (referred
as NS) and according to manufacturer instructions. In
particular, the sample volume was 500 µL and the elution
volume was 100 µL. Resultant RNA was analyzed using the
RNA UltraSense One-Step kit (Invitrogen SA) and RT-qPCR
performed as described in Schlosser et al. (2014) for HEV
(referred as RT-qPCR1) and as in ISO 15216-1:2017 for
MgV (Supplementary Table 5). For both RT-qPCR assays,
undiluted and 1/10 diluted RNA was tested to check for
RT-qPCR inhibitors.
Moreover, RNAs were also quantified using the
ceeramTOOLSR Hepatitis E Virus Detection KHEV commercial
kit (BioMérieux SA) (referred as RT-qPCR2) provided with an
internal amplification control.
In all experiments, all samples were run in duplicate
and different controls were used, including negative
process, extraction and RT-qPCR controls, and controls for
extraction efficiency.
Hepatitis E virus was quantified by plotting the
quantification cycles (Cqs) to an external standard curve
built with the International Standard WHO HEV RNA (code
6329/10). Moreover, extraction efficiencies were calculated
and used as quality assurance parameters according to
ISO 15216-1:2017 (2017).
Analysis of Naturally Contaminated
Influent and Effluent Wastewater
A total of 62 influent and 52 effluent wastewater samples were
investigated for the occurrence of HEV as hereafter detailed.
Initially, influent (n = 32) and effluent (n = 32) water
samples were collected from four municipal WWTPs located
in the Valencian region (eastern Spain), from May 2018 to
March 2019 (Figure 1). Two-hundred milliliters of influent and
effluent water samples were processed using the Al procedure.
Mengovirus was used as process control. RNA extraction was
performed using the NucleoSpinR RNA Virus kit (MN kit) and
HEV RNA quantified by both RT-qPCR1 and RT-qPCR2. In
addition, RNA samples were analyzed by a third RT-qPCR assay
(referred as RT-qPCR3, Supplementary Table 5; Girón-Callejas
et al., 2015). Additional influent (n = 30) and effluent (n = 20)
samples were further collected in June, August, and October
2018 and from April 2019 to August 2019 and analyzed by RT￾qPCR3 only.
Analysis of Drinking Water Samples
A total of 28 influent and 28 effluent water samples were
collected from two municipal DWTPs (Figure 1) in October
and November 2018. The samples were maintained under
refrigeration (4◦C) for transportation and processed within
24 h. Water samples (20 L) were dechlorinated with sodium
thiosulphate (10% wt/vol) after collection, added with
mengovirus and concentrated using the Rexeed-25A filters
and PEG precipitation, as detailed above. Resultant RNA was
extracted by the NucleoSpinR RNA Virus kit (MN kit) and
detected by RT-qPCR3.
Statistical Analysis
Results were statistically analyzed and significance of differences
was determined on the ranks with a one-way analysis of
variance (ANOVA) and Tukey’s multiple comparison tests.
In all cases, a value of p < 0.05 was deemed significant.
Spearman’s rank-order correlation coefficient (ρS) was
determined between inhabitants and HEV positive samples
by using Statistica software (StatSoft Inc., Tulsa, OK,
United States). The estimated probability of detection with
95% confidence (LoD95%) was calculated by using the PODLOD

calculation program (version9) (Wilrich and Wilrich, 2009) for
all water samples.
Ethics Statement
Fecal samples were collected at Hospital Clínico Universitario
de Valencia (Valencia, Spain). The study was approved by
the Comisión de Ética en Investigación Experimental of the
University of Valencia (Spain), in accordance with the World
Medical Association’s Declaration of Helsinki and the relevant
European and Spanish guidelines and regulations.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Detection Limit and Efficiency of the
Procedure to Concentrate HEV in
Influent Water
One major limitation in understanding HEV transmission
in contaminated waters is the lack of standardized and
validated methods (Ricci et al., 2017). Thus, to provide
data on the performance of the HEV detection methods in
environmental waters, an ultracentrifugation-based protocol
(UC) was compared to an aluminum precipitation procedure
(Al) using artificially inoculated influent water samples. The
mean HEV recoveries obtained with the UC concentration
procedure ranged from 7.98 to 16.83% using MN kit and
from 10.24 to 55.08% using NS kit. The Al procedure
resulted in mean HEV recovery values ranging from 7.00 to
20.54% and from 10.18 to 90.19% using MN and NS kits,
respectively (Table 1).
The Al procedure was selected for the determination of
LoD95% since an ultracentrifuge is not required. To determine
LoD95%, influent water was artificially inoculated with MgV
together with four levels of HEV and samples concentrated
according to the Al procedure. RNA extraction from concentrates
was performed using MN and NS kits and subsequently analyzed
by RT-qPCR1 and RT-qPCR2.
The mean HEV recovery values obtained using the MN
and NS kits ranged from 8.81 to 36.8% and from 8.90
to 41.45%, respectively (Figure 2 and Supplementary
Table 1), and no statistically significant differences were
observed (P > 0.05). On average, LoD95% was 2.9 × 105
IU/L for MN kit and 2.2 × 106
IU/L for NS kit, calculated
according to Wilrich and Wilrich (2009). Accordingly,
LoD95% increased approximately 10-fold when NS was

compared to MN extraction procedure. Overall, the MN
kit combined with RT-qPCR1 provided the best LoD95%,
which was similar to or slightly higher than those previously
reported for other enteric viruses in influent waters
(approx. 104–105
genome copies/L) (Nordgren et al., 2009;
Randazzo et al., 2019).
The MgV recovered using the MN and NS kits ranged from
7.92 to 8.72% (8.34% mean) and from 17.76 to 24.29% (21.56%
mean), respectively (Figure 2 and Supplementary Table 1).
These results support previously reported MgV recoveries in
influent waters (Miura et al., 2016). Because only 35 mL of
sample are needed for the analysis and ultracentrifugation is
not required, the procedure is a potential alternative method for
routine influent water screening.
Detection Limit and Efficiency of the Al
Procedure to Concentrate HEV in
Effluent Water
Few studies over the last decade have assessed the presence
of HEV in effluent water samples due in part to the lack
of validated procedures (Fenaux et al., 2019). Therefore, the
performance of the Al concentration method was analyzed
using effluent water samples that were collected downstream
from WWTP1 and artificially spiked with four levels of
HEV and with MgV, as process control. The MN and NS
extraction kits and RT-qPCR1 and RT-qPCR2 were used
for sample processing. Viral recovery and HEV LoD95%
were determined and the results are shown in Figure 3
and Supplementary Table 2.
MgV recoveries using the MN and NS kit ranged from
30.08 to 54.50% (41.17% mean) and from 21.52 to 28.32%
(23.90% mean), respectively, which are slightly higher than
the 8–13% recovery rates of cross-flow ultrafiltration reported
previously (Miura et al., 2016). The mean recovery of HEV
ranged from 8.33 to 30.01% using the MN kit and from
7.72 to 41.90% with the NS kit. LoD95% was 1.25 × 104
IU/L regardless of the RNA extraction and RT-qPCR used
(Supplementary Table 2).
Detection Limit and Efficiency of the
Procedure to Concentrate HEV in
Drinking Water
Prior to concentration, 20 L tap water samples were added with
four different concentrations of HEV, and MgV, as a whole
process control. Primary virus concentration was performed
using DEUF with Rexeed-25A filters, resulting in an average
eluate volume of 605 ± 38.22 mL. Then, the secondary
concentration was evaluated comparing in parallel a PEG
precipitation and a centrifuge filtration. DEUF ultrafiltration
combined with PEG precipitation and MN kit resulted in HEV
mean recovery of 16.6 to 36.6%, while recoveries ranged from
7.2 to 8.3% for NS kit (Figure 4A and Supplementary Table 3).
The centrifuge filtration procedure using MN and NS resulted in
mean HEV recovery values ranging from 1.8 to 4.9% and 23.7
to 35.7%, respectively (Figure 4B and Supplementary Table 4).
A minimum recovery rate of 1% MgV was achieved from all
procedures, validating the results. For all the tested procedures,
the HEV LoD95% in drinking water was of 6.2 × 103
IU/L
(Supplementary Tables 3, 4).
Performance of RT-qPCR Assays of HEV
in Naturally Contaminated Wastewater
Samples
A lack of information on HEV viral loads before and after
treatments applied in WWTPs has been identified (Fenaux
et al., 2019). In the present study, a total of 64 samples were
collected upstream (n = 32) and downstream (n = 32) of four
WWTPs, and these samples were concentrated according to
the Al procedure combined with the MN kit and analyzed
by different RT-qPCRs assays. To improve the sensibility of
the RT-qPCR assays, the initial 35 mL influent water sample

volume was increased to 200 mL. Initially, two different RT￾qPCRs were applied to assess HEV occurrence. Surprisingly,
RT-qPCR1 showed a limited number of positives compared
to RT-qPCR2 (Figure 5) despite a previous study reported
similar performance of these assays in influent water samples
(Randazzo et al., 2018). Suspecting that a different HEV genotype
was circulating, a third RT-qPCR assay was included in the
study. In particular, a method widely used in clinical and
environmental virology firstly described by Jothikumar et al.
(2006) and modified by Girón-Callejas et al. (2015) (RT-qPCR3)
was applied to retest samples. All the samples had a minimum
recovery rate of 1% MgV, validating the results. Overall, out
of 32 influent water samples, 12 were positive for at least
one of the three HEV RT-qPCR assays, and an overall HEV
prevalence of 37.5% was found. Different numbers of positive
samples and different prevalence rates were recorded during the
comparison of the three RT-qPCR assays (Figure 5). In particular,
prevalence rates of 12.5, 28.5, and 37.5% in influent waters were
recorded for the RT-qPCR1, RT-qPCR2, and RT-qPCR3 assays,
respectively. Although RT-qPCR1 fail to detect HEV in several
samples, lower Cq values were observed in samples collected
from January 2019 on (Figure 5). The observed differences may
be due to HEV genotype variability. Unfortunately, conducted
genotyping analyses did not solve the question because of the
negative results, likely due to the low genome titers in the
samples. Therefore, due to the high variability of the HEV
genotypes (Smith et al., 2013, 2016), the RT-qPCR assays used for
environmental analyses must be carefully checked to avoid false
negative results.
Surveillance of HEV in Influent and
Effluent Water Samples From WWTPs
and DWTPs
Data about the occurrence of HEV in Spanish wastewaters are
scarce, therefore the number of influent and effluent samples
were expanded and 62 influent and 52 effluent water samples
were analyzed by RT-qPCR3 (Table 2). In the current study
HEV is widely disseminated (30.65%) in Valencian influent
waters even though the prevalence rates among WWTPs varies
widely (Supplementary Figure 1). For example, WWTP4 had a
prevalence rate of 73.33% (11/15) using the RT-qPCR3 assay. As
a public health concern, this WWTP receives domestic sewage
from several municipalities, accounting for 108,000 inhabitants,
even though we cannot exclude streams from pig farms or other
agricultural run-offs. In contrast, WWTP1 (14,000 inhabitants)

and WWTP2 (188,000 inhabitants) showed only 12.5 and 13.33%
prevalence, respectively. These data show no correlation between
HEV prevalence and the number of inhabitants served by
WWTPs (ρS = 0.26).
Studies conducted in Barcelona (Spain) have shown similar
prevalence (from 13.5 to 43.5% in influent waters, with absence or
low detection of HEV in effluent waters (Clemente-Casares et al.,
2003; Rodriguez-Manzano et al., 2010; Rusiñol et al., 2015).

The present study showed HEV contamination in influent
waters ranging from approximately 1.3 × 103–3.5 × 104
IU/L
using the RT-qPCR3 assay (Table 2), which is consistent with
previously reported levels (Fenaux et al., 2019). HEV genomes
were not detected in effluent waters (Table 2). These results
are consistent with most of the studies published in Europe
(Fenaux et al., 2019), even those done after a confirmed outbreak
(Miura et al., 2016). This suggests that treatments applied at
WWTPs (Supplementary Figure 1) are efficient in removing
HEV despite the fact that a reduction of 1–2 log would result in
concentrations below the LoD95%. Thus, further improvements
are needed to increase the sensitivity of the methods applied for
virus concentration in effluent waters.
Additionally, a total of 56 samples were collected upstream
(n = 28) and downstream (n = 28) of two DWTPs, and 20 L
water samples were concentrated by DEUF using Rexeed-25A
filters combined with PEG precipitation, the MN kit and analyzed
by RT-qPCR3. None of the influent and effluent samples were
positive for HEV despite all the samples had a minimum recovery
rate of 1% MgV (Table 2).
CONCLUSION
Hepatitis E virus is considered an emerging pathogen in
industrialized countries, especially in Europe, and analytical
procedures for estimating HEV concentrations in water samples
are required. Among the different methodologies evaluated in
this study, HEV concentration with aluminum hydroxide was
able to detect HEV in influent and effluent water samples.
However, the limited sensitivity of the method could be

improved, for example by increasing the sample volume. The
procedure for drinking water includes a DEUF step using a
30 kDa membrane to reduce the sample volume from 20 to
200 L to approximately 500 mL. Overall, the results showed
that HEV is efficiently recovered from spiked drinking water
samples processed using a PEG secondary concentration and the
MN extraction kit.
This study also confirms that the selection of the RT-qPCR
assays is critical since the overall performance of the methods
varied considerably, most likely based on the circulating strains.
In particular, this aspect remarkably affects genotyping results
and thus epidemiology and traceability investigations.
Wastewater is an important environmental source for
studying the epidemiology of viral pathogens transmitted via the
fecal-oral route, and the current study demonstrated that HEV
circulated in the Valencian region at around 30.6% during 2018–
2019. No HEV was detected in effluent samples from WWTP
and influent and effluent samples from DWTP. However, given
that the infective dose in waterborne epidemics settings is not
yet known and the low sensibility of the assay, unfortunately,
no direct conclusion could be achieved on the risk assessment of
environmental contamination.
