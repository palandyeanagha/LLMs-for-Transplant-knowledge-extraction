Abstract
Biliary atresia (BA) is a neonatal disease that results in obliteration of the biliary tree. The murine model of BA, which
mirrors the human disease, is based upon infection of newborn mice with rhesus rotavirus (RRV), leading to an
obstructive cholangiopathy. The purpose of this study was to characterize the temporal relationship between viral
infection and the induction of this model. BALB/c mice were infected with RRV on day of life (DOL) 0, 3, 5, and 7.
Groups were characterized as early-infection (infection by DOL 3) or late-infection (infection after DOL 5). Early RRV
infection induced symptoms in 95% of pups with a mortality rate of 80%. In contrast, late infection caused symptoms
in only 50% of mice, and 100% of pups survived. The clinical findings correlated with histological analysis of
extrahepatic biliary trees, cytokine expression, and viral titers. Primary murine cholangiocytes isolated, cultured, and
infected with RRV yielded higher titers of infectious virus in those harvested from DOL 2 versus DOL 9 mice. Less
interferon alpha and beta was produced in DOL 2 versus DOL 9 RRV infected primary cholangiocytes. Injection of
BALB/c interferon alpha/beta receptor knockout (IFN-αβR−/−) pups at DOL 7 showed increased symptoms (79%) and
mortality (46%) when compared to late infected wild type mice. In conclusion, the degree of injury sustained by
relatively immature cholangiocytes due to more robust RRV replication correlated with more severe clinical
manifestations of cholangiopathy and higher mortality. Interferon alpha production by cholangiocytes appears to play
a regulatory role. These findings confirm a temporal dependence of RRV infection in murine BA and begin to define a
pathophysiologic role of the maturing cholangiocyte.

Introduction
Biliary atresia (BA) is a devastating inflammatory
cholangiopathy, leading to obstruction of the biliary tree and,
without treatment, death within two years of birth. It is the most
common etiology of obstructive neonatal cholestasis and
remains the number one indication for pediatric liver
transplantation in the United States. The incidence of BA is
estimated at 1 in 8,000-15,000 live births [1] and is a disease
unique to infancy. Afflicted children manifest symptoms of
biliary obstruction including jaundice, acholic stool, and failure
to thrive in the first few weeks of life. Initial therapy includes
surgical bypass; however, most patients ultimately require liver
transplantation due to end-stage disease. Interestingly, BA
does not recur after transplantation.
Biliary atresia’s etiology remains uncertain. The most
convincing evidence favors infectious and/or immune
etiologies. Multiple viruses have been found within the livers of
afflicted children, including reovirus type 3 and group C
rotavirus [2–4], and studies suggest that the pathogenesis of
bile duct obstruction is mediated by a T-cell, NK cell, and
macrophage dependent response [5–7]. Additionally, both
human and murine studies of BA have demonstrated elevated
levels of inflammatory cytokines including interferon-γ (IFN-γ),
tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-10, and
IL-18 that correspond to the previously described immune
response [8,9]. A unifying hypothesis has been proposed,
postulating that a primary infectious agent tropic for the biliary
epithelial cell, or cholangiocyte, initiates a secondary, immune￾mediated injury resulting in a sclerosing cholangiopathy [10].
The murine model of BA in which infection of newborn mice
with rhesus rotavirus (RRV) results in biliary obstruction is
important evidence supporting this hypothesis. The
morphologic and histological findings in the diseased murine
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 July 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 7 | e69069

extra-hepatic biliary tree are similar to those found in humans
at the time of diagnosis [11,12]. In earlier work, it has been
shown that RRV specifically targets the biliary epithelium for
infection [13,14] and RRV’s ability to bind to, and subsequently
infect, the cholangiocyte cell surface is mediated in part by the
α2β1 integrin [15–19].
Previously, both Riepenhoff-Talty and Czech-Schmidt have
demonstrated that the murine model of BA is induced when
viral infection occurs within 48 hours of birth [20,21]. If infected
after this time period, symptoms of biliary obstruction are
mitigated. Other work has demonstrated that RRV infection
elicits a specific, time dependent activation of apoptosis in
cholangiocytes [22] and induction of regulatory T cells [23].
When taken together, these data may explain why BA occurs
only in infancy, supporting the hypothesis of a perinatal trigger.
The purpose of the present study was to further characterize
the temporal nature of BA, focusing specifically on the
interaction of the neonatal cholangiocyte with RRV as well as
the subsequent severity of biliary injury.
Materials and Methods
Ethics Statement
All animal research was performed in accordance with
regulations and protocols approved by the Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at Cincinnati Children’s
Hospital Medical Center.
Murine model of biliary atresia
Breeding pairs of wild-type BALB/c mice (Harlan Labs,
Indianapolis, IN) and interferon alpha/beta receptor knockout
(IFN-αβR−/−) mice on a BALB/c background (a generous gift
from Dr. Bezerra’s lab, Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical
Center) were kept in micro-isolator cages in a virus-free
environment with free access to sterilized chow and water. The
mice were bred and separated approximately 1 week before
their expected delivery. Intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of
newborn pups with RRV at a dose of 1.25 x 106 FFU/gram
body weight was performed on day of life (DOL) 0, 3, 5, or 7.
Pups injected with normal saline served as controls at each
time point.
Injected pups were monitored for 21 days. Weight gain,
clinical signs of hepatobiliary injury (i.e. jaundice in non-fur
covered skin, acholic stools and bilirubinuria), and survival
were recorded. Pups categorized as symptomatic had at least
two signs of cholestasis including jaundice, bilirubinuria, weight
loss, acholic stools, or oily appearance of fur. Classification as
“symptom-free” signified absence of any symptoms.
Subsets of infected pups were sacrificed 1, 3, 5, 7, and 14
days post-infection (PI). The gross morphology of the liver and
the hepatobiliary system was documented. The extrahepatic
biliary trees and a portion of the liver were procured using
micro dissection. Both specimens were weighed, homogenized
in 0.5 ml of Earle’s balanced salt solution (EBSS) (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with Ca2+ and placed on ice.
Samples were stored at -80°C until analyzed for live virus.
Additional murine bile duct and liver samples were snap frozen
in Histo Prep (Fisher Scientific, Fair Lawn, New Jersey) for
immunohistochemistry or were embedded in paraffin for
histological analysis.
Isolation of primary murine cholangiocytes
On DOL 2 and 9, primary cholangiocytes were harvested
from non-infected neonatal BALB/c pups. DOL 2 and 9 were
selected for harvest, as mice two days post-infection (injected
on either DOL 0 or 7) were found to contain significant amounts
of RRV in their extrahepatic biliary system, indicating that in
vivo, virus had reached the biliary system and could infect
cholangiocytes. Livers were harvested, homogenized, and
digested in Dulbecco’s Modification of Eagle’s Medium (DMEM/
F12) supplemented with L-glutamine, penicillin streptomycin,
heat inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) (all from Invitrogen),
collagenase, hyaluronidase and DNase I (all from Sigma￾Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). After incubation for 1 hour at 37°C, the
slurry was passed through a 40-µm filter and cells were
washed, collected and purified through a Percoll gradient (GE
Healthcare, Sweden). Cells were washed twice and pelleted.
The cells were then resuspended in phosphate buffered saline
(PBS) (Gibco) supplemented with 0.1% bovine serum albumin
(BSA) and incubated at 4°C with an Ep-CAM antibody
generated by the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank at
the University of Iowa. The cell were washed, suspended in
PBS/0.1% BSA and incubated at 4°C with sheep anti-rat
Dynabead IgG antibodies (Invitrogen). The dynabead coated
cells were further purified using a magnet, suspended in
cholangiocyte growth media, plated on collagen coated T25
cell culture flasks (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ) and
incubated at 37°C in 5% CO2
 until 75% confluent. The cells
were passaged once and grown to confluence. During
passaging, cells were regularly assayed for the cholangiocyte
markers CK-7 and CK-19, and those used for experimentation
came from passage 3 through 5 as described previously [24].
Morphologic assessment of biliary injury and
immunohistochemistry for viral localization
Paraffin embedded liver and bile duct samples were serially
sectioned at 5µm along the length of the block. Sections were
stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and Mason’s
trichrome using standard techniques. For the extra-hepatic
biliary tract, a previously described ordinal scoring system was
used to assess the degree of injury [13]. All sections were
graded by the same blinded pathologist (David Witte).
Similarly, frozen samples of liver and bile ducts were
sectioned serially at 5µm. They were blocked with 2% normal
goat serum and mouse-on-mouse (MOM) blocking reagent
(Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) for 60 min at room
temperature and underwent dual immunofluorescence staining
for localization of RRV to the cholangiocyte using techniques
previously described [25]. All sections were analyzed using
Nikon Eclipse E600 microscope and photographed with a
Nikon Digital Camera DXM1200F.
Quantification of Liver Enzymes
BALB/c pups were injected with RRV or saline on either DOL
0 or 7. Cardiac puncture was performed on subsets of mice at
7 and 12 days post injection. Serum was collected into serum

separator tubes (Becton Dickinson) and 4-6 mice were pooled
per sample. Quantitative determination of direct bilirubin,
alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate
aminotransferase (AST) were performed in triplicate as per the
manufacturer instructions (Teco Diagnsotics, Anaheim, CA).

RNA isolation and real time PCR for cytokines
BALB/c pups were injected with RRV or saline on either DOL
0 or 7. Subsets of mice were sacrificed at 2, 5, and 7 days after
injection, their livers were harvested, and the messenger RNA
(mRNA) expression for IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-6, IL-10, and IL-18
was quantified by real-time PCR. mRNA expression of IFN-α
and IFN-β was carried out in the primary cholangiocytes
following RRV infection. Total RNA from the tissues and
primary cholangiocytes was extracted using the RNeasy Mini
Kit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD) according to manufacturer’s
instructions. cDNA pools generated using standard reagents
(Invitrogen) were subjected to real-time kinetic PCR on a
Mx-3000 Multiplex Quantitative PCR (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA)
using SYBR Green to quantify mRNA expression of these
cytokines relative to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
dehydrogenase (GAPDH) using techniques previously
described [14]. Primers for the assayed cytokines are detailed
in Table 1.
Quantification of IFN-α protein in primary
cholangiocytes after RRV infection
Primary cholangiocytes isolated at DOL2 and 9 were seeded
in 24-well plates in DMEM/F12 as previously described and
incubated at 37°C until 90% confluence. Plates were washed
with EBSS, infected with RRV at an MOI of 100, and incubated
at 37°C. Supernatants were collected at 16 and 24 hours for
IFN-α quantification using the VeriKine Mouse Interferon Alpha
ELISA kit (Pestka Biomedical Laboratories, Piscataway, NJ).
Quantification of live infectious rotavirus
Tissue homogenates and cell suspensions were analyzed for
the presence of infectious rotavirus by a fluorescent focus￾forming assays (FFA) as previously described [26].
Measurement of viral binding using an attachment
assay
The ability of the virus to attach to the primary
cholangiocytes was assessed by binding assays as described
previously [27]. In brief, cultured cells were grown to
confluence in 24-well plates. Attachment assays were
performed in triplicate. At the time of assay, the cells, medium,
and inoculating virus were cooled to 4°C. Cells were inoculated
with RRV at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.5 and were
incubated for 1 h at 4°C. The inoculum was removed, and the
cells were washed twice to remove any unbound virus. The
wash fluids and the residual inoculum were combined to
account for all unbound viruses. The cells underwent 2 freeze￾thaw cycles, and any virus found within the final cell fraction
reflected bound virus. The amounts of bound and unbound
virus were determined by FFA analysis. The amount of bound
virus was expressed as a percentage of the total amount of
virus used to inoculate the cells.
Measurement of RRV replication in primary
cholangiocytes
Cholangiocytes isolated from murine livers at different days
of life were seeded in 24-well plates in DMEM/F12 as
previously described and incubated at 37°C until 90%
confluence. Plates were washed with EBSS and infected with
RRV at varying MOI at 37°C for 1 h. At an MOI of 1, the
amount of virus equals the number of cells. The cultures were
washed and incubated with serum free DMEM/F12 at 37°C for
18 h and viral yields were assessed by FFA.
Statistical analysis
Results of morbidity and mortality from RRV infection were
based on at least 20 pups per infection time point. Findings
were expressed as percentages of pups expressing symptoms
(at least two findings) and percent survival. Analysis of these
non-continuous variables was done using Chi-square and
Fisher Exact testing. Each temporal subset utilized for ELISA,
FFA, and RT-PCR analysis consisted of at least 10 pups.
Results of these continuous variables were expressed as mean
+/- Standard Error of the Mean (SEM) and analyzed using
Student’s t-test and ANOVA with post-hoc testing as
appropriate. Biliary injury, in each category, was represented
as a median score followed by its range. Comparisons were
made using ANOVA on Ranks with Dunn’s Method for post-hoc
testing with p values less than 0.05 deemed significant.
Results
Initiation of the murine model of BA is temporally
dependent
100% of BALB/c pups challenged with RRV on DOL 0
developed symptoms, and only 20% of mice were alive at 21
days of age. Infection on DOL 3 caused symptoms in 95% of
pups with a survival rate of 5%. Because development of
symptoms and mortality rates were similar in pups injected on
DOL 0 and 3, these two cohorts were categorized as the early
infection group. Pups challenged on DOL 5 resulted in
symptoms in 50% of pups, and by post injection (PI) day 21,

only 9% had manifestations of hepatobiliary disease. All of the
inoculated pups survived. In a similar fashion, 55% of pups
infected on DOL 7 developed symptoms and, by PI day 21, all
were symptom-free and survived (Figure 1). Because pups
challenged on DOL 5 and 7 responded similarly, these cohorts
were categorizes as the late infection group. When the early
and late infection groups were compared, the symptoms of
biliary obstruction and mortality in the early infection group
were greater than those of the late infection group (p<0.05).
Normal saline challenged pups developed no signs of
hepatobiliary disease and experienced no mortality. These
results confirm the temporal dependence of the murine model
of biliary atresia [21].
Histological biliary injury and elevated liver enzymes
correlate with in vivo findings
Histological evaluation of extrahepatic biliary trees
demonstrated that biliary epithelial injury was similar between
the early and late infection groups over the first five days after
RRV challenge; however, when comparing samples harvested
7 days PI, the amount of cholangiocyte epithelial damage and
bile duct edema was significantly greater in the early infection
group (Table 2). In the early infection group, luminal
cholangiocytes were blunted in height, atrophic, and sloughed
in various sections of bile ducts. In contrast, the morphology
and structure of cholangiocytes in the late infection group were
unaffected (Figure 2). By 14 days PI, the early infection group
demonstrated greater intraepithelial injury and stromal
proliferation, but in late infected mice, the biliary epithelium
recovered with resolution of inflammation. Serum harvested
from early and late infected pups was examined for direct
bilirubin, ALT and AST levels. Significantly elevated levels of
direct bilirubin were seen in the early infection group at 7 and
14 days PI as compared to the late infection group (Figure 3A).
ALT and AST levels were also significantly increased in the
early infection versus the late infection group at 7 and 14 days
PI (Figure 3B, C). Levels of direct bilirubinwere significantly
elevated over normal saline injected control mice at 7 and 14
days PI in the early infection group and at 7 days PI in the late
infection group; ALT and AST levels were significantly higher
than the normal saline controls at 14 days PI in the early
infection group (data not shown).
Expression of pro-inflammatory genes is increased in
early-infected compared to late-infected animals
Given the clinical and histological findings, we determined
whether these findings correlated with differences in the
production of cytokines previously shown to play a role in the
pathogenesis of murine biliary atresia. RT-PCR revealed that
mRNA levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IFN-γ, TNF-α,
IL-6, IL-10, and IL-18 from liver homogenates of animals
inoculated with RRV on DOL 0 (representative of early
infection) were all significantly elevated compared to those
from control animals 7 days after injection (p<0.05) (Figure 4).
In contrast, expression of these mRNA in livers from mice
injected with RRV on DOL 7 (representative of late infection)
was significantly different. IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-18 mRNA
expressions were elevated 2 days PI (p<0.05); however by PI
day 5, expression levels of these cytokines were not
significantly different compared to control. By PI day 7, mRNA
level of all 3 cytokines in the late infection group had decreased
to values below those observed 2 days PI. Interestingly, the
mRNA expression of IL-10 in the RRV injected mice was
increased at all-time points in both early and late infected mice
when compared to controls. In the case of IL-6, mRNA
expression levels were not significantly different in late infected
animals at any time point.
Differences in temporal distribution, not viral tropism,
of RRV between the early and late infection groups
characterize murine BA
To establish the basis for the observed temporal
dependence of murine BA, we determined whether the target

of viral infection varied according to the DOL on which RRV
challenge took place as well as if virus reached the
hepatobiliary system in late infection. The presence of live virus
was detected in the bile ducts and livers within 24 hours of
infection in all RRV-inoculated pups, regardless of early or late
inoculation (Figure 5). The peak titer of live virus differed
depending upon the DOL on which inoculation took place. At PI
day 1 and 3 there was no significant difference in the amount of
live virus in either biliary or hepatic samples in both groups. At
7 days PI, there was a greater amount of RRV present in both
bile duct and liver samples from the early infection group as
compared to those from the late infection group. By day 14 PI,
no infectious virus was detectable in either bile duct or liver
samples regardless of inoculation period (Figure 5A, B). The
amounts of infectious RRV detected in homogenates of the
extrahepatic biliary tract were ten-fold higher than liver
homogenates from corresponding mice at each time point
analyzed (Figure 5A,B).
The target of RRV infection was identical regardless of the
DOL on which inoculation took place. Immunofluorescence
demonstrated co-localization of virus and cytokeratin 7, a
marker for biliary epithelium, on PI days 5 and 7 for the early
and late infection groups, indicating that the biliary epithelium
was the specific target of RRV binding and infection.
Representative samples harvested at 5 days PI are shown in
Figure 6. Saline controls were negative for RRV staining (data
not shown).
The ability of RRV to bind and infect primary
cholangiocytes is determined by developmental age
In order to assess differences of viral yield among
cholangiocytes of differing age, we infected primary BALB/c
murine cholangiocytes harvested from DOL 2 and 9 mice with
RRV at increasing MOIs. As demonstrated by Table 3, the
amount of live, infectious RRV produced was significantly
higher in cholangiocytes obtained from DOL 2 mice as
compared to the amount from cholangiocytes obtained from
DOL 9 mice (p<0.05). These differences persisted at all MOI
tested. Interestingly, RRV demonstrated no difference in its
ability to bind to DOL 2 or 9 cholangiocytes (12.8%±2.2 vs
10.8%± 0.6 respectively) as determined by binding assays.
Expression of interferon alpha/beta in primary
cholangiocytes following RRV infection is temporally
dependent
The above results indicate that cholangiocytes obtained from
DOL 2 and 9 mice allow for similar binding and infectivity of
RRV. To determine the basis by which primary cholangiocytes

harvested from DOL 2 mice replicate RRV to a higher titer than
primary cholangiocytes harvested from DOL 9 mice, we
examined the expression of interferon alpha/beta (IFN-α/ β),
which plays a key role in the host defense against invading
virus. Real-time PCR was used to determine the IFN-α/β gene
expression over a 24-hour time course after infection of primary
cholangiocytes harvested from DOL 2 versus DOL 9. Following
infection the cholangiocytes harvested from DOL 9 mice
expressed a 3-fold larger amount of IFN-α compared to
cholangiocytes harvested from DOL 2 mice at 8, 16 and 24
hours (Figure 7A). Similarly DOL 9 cholangiocytes express 2-
fold higher amount of IFN-β at 16 hours compared to DOL 2
cholangiocytes (Figure 7B).
To confirm the gene expression data interferon alpha protein
quantification was also performed on DOL 2 and DOL 9
primary cholangiocytes after RRV infection. Supernatants
collected at 16 and 24 hours, which represented the highest
level of gene expression on real-time PCR, demonstrated
greater quantities of IFN-α protein at both the time points in the
DOL 9 cholangiocytes compared to the DOL 2 cholangiocytes
(Figure 8). The amount produced at 24 hours in the DOL 9
cholangiocytes was significantly increased over the amount
produced by the DOL 2 cholangiocytes, consistent with the
findings of gene expression.
Initiation of the murine model of BA is extended to late
infected IFN-α/β receptor deficient mice (IFN-αβR−/−)
To determine if IFN-α regulates the temporal dependency of
the murine model of biliary atresia, we injected IFN-αβR-/- mice
at DOL 0 and DOL 7. IFN-αβR-/- mice injected at DOL 0
showed symptoms and mortality similar to that of wild-type
DOL 0 injected mice (data not shown). In contrast, 79% of IFN￾αβR−/−mice injected at DOL 7 showed symptoms of biliary
disease compared to 55% of wild-type mice (Figure 9A).
Twenty-one days post infection DOL 7 injected IFN-αβR−/−mice
had a 46% mortality rate as compared to 0% for wild-type mice
(Figure 9B).
Quantity of live RRV in bile ducts seven days post
injection
Due to the increase in symptom and mortality rates in DOL 7
injected IFN-αβR−/− mice, we wanted to determine if these were
related to an increase in viral replication. DOL 0 injected IFN￾αβR−/− mice and WT mice express similar titers of RRV in their
bile ducts seven days post infection. In contrast, DOL 7
injected IFN-αβR−/−mice expressed a significantly greater
amount of live RRV in their bile ducts compared to DOL 7
injected WT mice (Figure 9C).

Bile duct histology of WT and IFN-αβR-/-mice following
RRV infection
To confirm bile duct obstruction after RRV inoculation of IFN￾αβR−/− mice, bile duct histology was examined and compared to
WT mice. Obstruction was demonstrated in WT mice in the
early but not the late infection group at 7 and 14 days PI.
However, IFN-αβR−/− mice in the late infection group
demonstrate bile duct obstruction at 7 and 14 days PI, similar
to that seen for the WT mice in the early infection group (Figure
10).
Discussion
Biliary atresia is a disease unique to infancy. Over the first
few weeks of life, afflicted children develop progressive biliary
obstruction and jaundice. Interestingly, BA does not occur in
adolescence or adulthood nor does it recur after liver
transplantation. The etiology and underlying factors specific to
infancy that govern susceptibility to disease is unknown. One
hypothesis is perinatal viral exposure activating both
inflammation and an autoimmune response. This is further
supported by several reports of de novo autoimmune hepatitis
after liver transplantation for BA [28,29]. In parallel to the
postulated process occurring in infants, previous studies have
demonstrated that induction of hepatobiliary injury in the
murine model of BA is dependent on the time of RRV infection
[2,21,22]. In early work, Riepenhoff-Talty and Czech-Schmidt
delineated the relationship between viral dosage and timing of
RRV infection and clinical symptoms [12,20]. To further
characterize the temporal dependence of the murine model, we
evaluated for differences in the appearance of symptoms and
mortality, the ability of RRV to target and replicate in the biliary
tract, modifications to the cholangiocyte during cellular
development, and activation of the inflammatory cascade,
including production of cytokines and chemokines. In this

series of experiment, we demonstrate that bile duct obstruction
occurs in early but not in the late infected group. These findings
are supported by histology as well as an obstructive pattern of
liver function tests, including significantly elevated direct
bilirubin, ALT and AST levels in the early infection group.

Previously, we established that RRV specifically targets the
biliary epithelium for infection in the murine model of BA
through cell-surface expression of the α2β1
-integrin [13,15]. In
this study, we observe that RRV reaches the biliary tract within
24 hours PI with similar titers of virus present in the biliary
samples in the early and late infected groups.
Immunofluorescence staining confirmed that the extrahepatic
bile duct, specifically the cholangiocyte, was the target of viral
infection in all groups. These results suggest that the basis for
the temporal dependence of the model is neither viral transport
to the biliary tree nor change in the ability of RRV to infect the
cholangiocyte. The ability of RRV to replicate within the
cholangiocyte, however, was different between the early and
late infection groups, with a decrease in the quantity of virus
detected in the late group with the progression of time. The
amount of virus present may be a factor that governs the
temporal dependence of murine BA.
A significant pro-inflammatory state in immature mice driven
by cytokines may play an important role in the temporal nature
of BA. A number of studies have documented increasing
mRNA and protein levels of these cytokines in both humans
and mice in relation to disease progression. Up-regulation of
pro-inflammatory cytokines in our study corresponds to the
temporal pattern of injury as well as the increased yield of live
rotavirus. Conversely, it would seem that the level of infectious
RRV drives cytokine production based upon results from
animals infected later. Early infected mice express higher
levels of IFN-γ and TNF-α compared to late infected mice but in
contrast, those late infected mice express higher levels of IL-10
at 2 and 5 days PI (Figure 3). Previously, it has been shown
that IFN-γ and TNF-α play important roles in the pathogenesis
of biliary atresia [14,30]. Since IL-10 is a pro-inflammatory
cytokine produced at the site of inflammation, increased IL-10
expression soon after infection in late infected mice might

result in less IFN-γ and TNF-α production thereby reducing
cholangiocyte damage.
Previous research has suggested that the cholangiocyte may
be a critical component in initiating and propagating the
pathologic immune response in murine BA [8,31]. The current
study suggests that an alteration in cholangiocyte physiology
occurs between DOL 1 and 5, thereby modulating cellular
response to infection. The observed differences in viral yield
from DOL 2 and 9 primary murine cholangiocytes 18 hours
after infection would indicate that cellular changes on a genetic
or molecular level occur, which influence viral replication. The
morphologic and functional heterogeneity of cholangiocytes is
comprehensively documented and well-described [32]. On the
other hand, the physiologic changes that occur in
cholangiocytes as they mature during the neonatal period are
not well known and may be logical areas of future study in both
murine and human cholangiocytes. From this study we propose
that the newborn cholangiocytes infected with virus might have
a defective interferon regulatory factor function resulting in
lower levels of IFN-α production allowing increased viral
replication. It has been reported that cord blood plasmacytoid
dendritic cells have an impaired interferon regulatory factor-7
(IRF-7) response leading to defective expression of IFN-α [33].
The same might hold true for early cholangiocytes. To date,
there is no data available from epithelial cells.
IFNs are involved in numerous immune interactions acting as
inducers, regulators, and effectors of both innate and adaptive
immunity. IFN-α/β is produced rapidly when viral factors such
as envelope glycoproteins or dsRNA interact with cellular
pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs), such as toll-like
receptors (TLRs), and cytosolic receptors. These host–virus
interactions signal downstream to activate transcription factors

WT and IFN-αβR−/−mice 3, 7 and 14 days post inoculation at early and late time points with RRV and stained with H and E. RRV
injection led to obstruction of the lumens of the extrahepatic bile ducts in the early but not the late infected WT mice. In contrast, the
lumens of the late infected IFN-αβR−/−mice were obstructed following RRV injection. Magnification: 10X.

needed to achieve expression of IFN-α/β genes. Among the
transcription factors, IRF-7 activation along with IRF-3 and
IRF-5 are critical for the induction of type 1 IFNs. IFNs signal
mainly through Jak-Stat pathways resulting in induction and
activation of numerous intrinsic antiviral factors, such as RNA￾activated protein kinase (PKR), the 2-5A system, Mx proteins,
and several apoptotic pathways, which provide protection in the
neighboring cells against subsequent viral infection.
In this study, we examined the IFN-α/β gene expression over
a 24 hour period after infection of primary cholangiocytes
harvested from DOL 2 versus DOL 9 mice. The cholangiocytes
harvested from day 9 old mice expressed a 3-fold higher
amount of IFN-α at 8, 16, and 24 hours and 2-fold higher
amount of IFN-β 16 hours post infection compared to
cholangiocytes harvested from day 2 old mice. These findings
were confirmed by quantification of IFN-α protein at 16 and 24
hours after RRV infection, which demonstrated a significant
increase in production by the DOL 9 cholangiocytes over the
DOL 2 cholangiocytes. The lack of IFN-α/β production in early
cholangiocytes may allow for increased replication rates of
RRV. Therefore, we asked the question: if higher IFN-α/β
production in the late cholangiocytes reduces RRV replication
in vitro and in vivo, will removal of IFN-α/β in the late injected
mice make them susceptible to disease? Since IFN-α/β null
mice are not available on a BALB/c background, we used the
interferon alpha/beta receptor knockout (IFN-αβR−/−). When
these mice were injected late (DOL 7), symptoms were
produced in 79% (50% in WT) with 46% mortality (0% in WT).
Histology demonstrated massive liver inflammation with bile
duct obstruction similar to DOL 0 injected WT mice.
Recently, Miethke et al. demonstrated the temporal role of
regulatory T cells (Tregs) and their control over activated CD8+
and NK cells in murine biliary atresia [23,34]. They found that
activated Tregs modulate biliary obstruction while depletion
exacerbates disease progression. Although the development of
the adaptive immune response contributes to BA pathogenesis,
our data suggests that cholangiocyte development also plays
an important role in the temporal dependence of murine biliary
atresia. The neonatal milieu of decreased interferon as well as
the absence of Tregs may provide the necessary environment
for sufficient viral load as well as inability to maintain peripheral
tolerance and prevent autoimmune disease. Therefore, a
search for viral infection in infants with BA may best be sought
during the neonatal period, when they have the highest
predicted viral burden. While Miethke et al. has shown that
isolated depletion of Tregs leads to biliary injury, our study
suggests that decreased IFN-α/β leads to increased viral load
and subsequent induction of the model even in older mice. The
development of obstructive cholangiopathy may require these
two systems working in parallel, with defects in both the innate
and adaptive immune systems early in life.
Further investigation is required to elucidate how the
temporal nature of the cholangiocyte response to RRV infection
triggers the adaptive immune response. The temporal
similarities between murine and human biliary atresia also
requires further research. The results of this study documenting
early events in the experimental model of BA may supplement
clinical understanding of the pathogenesis of human disease
and provide targets for early non-surgical intervention.
