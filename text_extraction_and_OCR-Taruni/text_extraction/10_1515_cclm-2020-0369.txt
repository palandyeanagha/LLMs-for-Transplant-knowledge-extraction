Abstract
Background: As coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) 
pandemic rages on, there is urgent need for identifica￾tion of clinical and laboratory predictors for progression 
towards severe and fatal forms of this illness. In this 
study we aimed to evaluate the discriminative ability of 
hematologic, biochemical and immunologic biomarkers 
in patients with and without the severe or fatal forms of 
COVID-19.
Methods: An electronic search in Medline (PubMed inter￾face), Scopus, Web of Science and China National Knowl￾edge Infrastructure (CNKI) was performed, to identify 
studies reporting on laboratory abnormalities in patients 
with COVID-19. Studies were divided into two separate 
cohorts for analysis: severity (severe vs. non-severe and 
mortality, i.e. non-survivors vs. survivors). Data was 
pooled into a meta-analysis to estimate weighted mean 
difference (WMD) with 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 
for each laboratory parameter.
Results: A total number of 21 studies was included, total￾ing 3377 patients and 33 laboratory parameters. While 
18  studies (n = 2984) compared laboratory findings 
between patients with severe and non-severe COVID￾19, the other three (n = 393) compared survivors and 
non-survivors of the disease and were thus analyzed 
separately. Patients with severe and fatal disease had sig￾nificantly increased white blood cell (WBC) count, and 
decreased lymphocyte and platelet counts compared to 
non-severe disease and survivors. Biomarkers of inflam￾mation, cardiac and muscle injury, liver and kidney func￾tion and coagulation measures were also significantly 
elevated in patients with both severe and fatal COVID-19. 
Interleukins 6 (IL-6) and 10 (IL-10) and serum ferritin were 
strong discriminators for severe disease.
Conclusions: Several biomarkers which may potentially 
aid in risk stratification models for predicting severe and 
fatal COVID-19  were identified. In hospitalized patients 
with respiratory distress, we recommend clinicians closely 
monitor WBC count, lymphocyte count, platelet count, 
IL-6 and serum ferritin as markers for potential progres￾sion to critical illness.
Keywords: clinical chemistry; coronavirus; COVID-19.
Introduction
In the fight against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID￾19), now a worldwide pandemic, urgent identification of 
clinical and laboratory predictors of progression towards 
severe and fatal forms is urgently needed. These predic￾tors will enable risk stratification, guide interventional 
studies to target patients at enhanced risk of developing 
severe disease and optimize allocation of limited human 
and technical resources in the ongoing pandemic. More￾over, identification of laboratory parameters capable of 
discriminating between severe and non-severe cases, 
or those at high or low risk of mortality, will allow for 
improved clinical situational awareness.

1022      Henry et al.: Laboratory abnormalities in COVID-19
Though similarities are noted between COVID-19 and 
the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), the World 
Health Organization (WHO) has observed differences 
in the clinical picture of the diseases caused by the two 
viruses [1]. We have previously described the typical labo￾ratory changes in both children and adults with COVID-19, 
observing some notable differences in laboratory para￾meters between COVID-19 and SARS viruses [2, 3].
In earlier reports, we have identified procalcitonin 
and platelet count as potential predictors of disease sever￾ity [2, 3]. However, with an increased volume of COVID-19 
reports now published, it has enabled a more comprehen￾sive analysis of laboratory data that is urgently needed by 
the medical and scientific communities. The aim of this 
study was to analyze laboratory abnormalities in patients 
with COVID-19, in order to define which parameters can 
discriminate between those who are at higher risk of 
developing severe vs. non-severe forms of disease, as well 
as those who are less likely to survive.
Materials and methods
Search strategy
We carried out an electronic search in Medline (PubMed 
interface), Scopus, Web of Science and China National 
Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), using the keywords 
“laboratory” OR “chemistry” OR “clinical” AND “corona￾virus 2019” OR “COVID-19” OR “2019-nCoV” OR “SARS￾CoV-2”, between 2019 and present time (i.e. March 17, 
2020), without date or language restrictions. The reference 
list of all identified documents was scrutinized with the 
aim of identifying additional potentially eligible studies. 
This systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted 
in conformity with the Preferred Reporting Items for Sys￾tematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines 
(Supplement 1).
Selection criteria
All studies were assessed for eligibility by two independ￾ent reviewers. Each reviewer assessed by title, abstract 
and full text each article identified in the search. Studies 
were deemed eligible for inclusion in this meta-analysis 
if they were (1) case series (at least 10 patients) or obser￾vational studies reporting clear extractable data on labo￾ratory abnormalities in laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 
patients and (2) compared the laboratory parameters 
between patients with severe or non-severe disease or 
between survivors and non-survivors. Editorials, reviews 
and case reports were excluded. All articles published in 
Chinese were assessed by a medical professional fluent 
in both Chinese and English. When data on laboratory 
parameters were identified, the article was translated 
into English to enable data collection. Any disagreements 
arising during the selection assessment were resolved by 
discussion and consensus.
Data collection
Data were independently extracted from the included 
COVID-19  studies by two independent reviewers. The 
data extracted included: authors, year of publication, 
country, sex, age, outcome, time of blood collection (hos￾pital admission or unclear) and laboratory values. When 
unavailable, mean and standard deviation of laboratory 
values were extrapolated from sample size, median and 
interquartile range (IQR), according to Hozo et  al.[4]. 
Severe disease was defined in this analysis as a composite 
of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), need for 
ventilation support, need for vital life support, or need for 
intensive care unit (ICU) support.
Statistical analysis
Studies were divided into two separate cohorts for analy￾sis: severity cohort and mortality cohort. A meta-analy￾sis was performed, with calculation of weighted mean 
difference (WMD) and 95% confidence interval (95% 
CI) for each laboratory parameter in COVID-19 patients 
with or without severe disease and non-survival or 
survival. Laboratory data was pooled whenever two or 
more studies reported a given parameter. Heterogene￾ity among the included studies was assessed using the 
chi square (χ2
) test and the I2
 statistic. For the χ2
 test, 
significant heterogeneity among the studies was indi￾cated with a Cochran’s Q p-value of <0.10. The I2
 statistic 
results were interpreted as 25%, 50% and 75% represent￾ing low, moderate and high heterogeneity, respectively 
[5]. To probe the sources of heterogeneity, when I2 > 50%, 
sensitivity analysis was performed employing a leave￾one-out analysis and subgroup analysis was performed 
excluding studies with unclear timepoints of laboratory 
measures. The statistical analysis was performed with 
MetaXL, software Version 5.3 (EpiGear International Pty 
Ltd., Sunrise Beach, Australia).

Results
Study identification and characteristics of 
included studies
A flow chart of studies through the analysis is presented 
in Figure 1. After duplicate screening, a total number of 
90 articles were initially identified, 74 of were excluded 
because they were review articles (n = 17), did not report 
data on COVID-19 disease (n = 38), did not provide labo￾ratory data on COVID-19 patients with or without severe 
disease or mortality (n = 10), or were editorial material 
(n = 9). Five additional studies could be identified from the 
reference list of selected articles. Thus, the pooled analy￾sis finally included 21 studies [6–26], with a total sample 
of 3377 confirmed COVID-19 patients, reporting data on 
33 laboratory parameters. Most studies were from China, 
with the exception of two studies from Singapore [8, 23]. 
All studies reported laboratory values measured at admis￾sion or earliest time point in hospitalization, except for six 
studies [7, 14, 16–18, 23], where the timepoint was unclear. 
The essential characteristics of the included studies are 
presented in Table 1.
Meta-analysis of laboratory abnormalities by 
disease severity
A total of 18 studies [6–9, 11–13, 15–21, 23–25], totaling 2984 
COVID-19 patients, reported laboratory data with compar￾ison between those with severe and non-severe disease. 
Full results are shown in Table 2 and forest plots in Supple￾ment 2. With respect to sensitivity analysis, a leave-one￾out analysis for white blood cell (WBC) count excluding 
the largest study by Guan et  al., a significant increase 
in the difference between severe and non-severe COVID 
patients was observed (WMD: 1.25 × 109
/L [95% CI: 0.91–
1.59 × 109
/L]). No significant differences were noted in any 
other sensitivity analysis or sub-group analysis excluding 
studies which had unclear timepoints of collection.

Meta-analysis of laboratory abnormalities by 
survival
A total of three studies [14, 22, 26], n = 393 reported labo￾ratory data with comparison between patients who sur￾vived and patients who did not survive. The analyses are 
presented in Table 2 and forest plots in Supplement 3. No 
differences were observed for any sensitivity or subgroup 
analysis. With respect to the severity cohort, non-survivors 
compared to survivors had more significant increases in 
WBC count, total bilirubin, creatine kinase, serum ferritin, 
and interleukin 6 (IL-6), and more significant decreases 
in lymphocyte count and platelet count. While patients 
with severe disease had significantly reduced hemoglobin 
values compared to non-severe, the same trend was not 
observed in non-survivors compared to survivors, with no 
significant difference in mean difference between groups.
Discussion
In this comprehensive meta-analysis, a clear pattern of 
inflammatory, hematologic, biochemical and immune 
biomarker abnormalities could be found between patients 
with or without severe disease, which may enable signifi￾cant discrimination to warrant inclusion in risk stratifi￾cation models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the 
first meta-analysis systematically comparing laboratory 
abnormalities in either a severity or mortality cohort. The 
overall results of this investigation are further summa￾rized in Table 3.
Several differences were observed between the sever￾ity and mortality cohorts. Patients with severe disease had 
only a mild increased in WBC count (WMD: 0.41 × 109
/L), 
while patients who died had a more clinically significant 
increase in this parameter (WMD: 4.15 × 109
/L). As such, 
in patients with severe disease, a significant increase in 
WBCs may signify clinical worsening and increased risk 
of a poor outcome. Our data indicates that the increase 
in WBCs is driven by elevated neutrophils, as decreasing 
trends were observed for lymphocytes, monocytes and 
eosinophils. In patients with severe disease, a decrease 
in both CD4 and CD8 was observed. With the SARS virus, 
it was suspected that lymphocytes are essential to elimi￾nating virally infected cells [27], while with COVID-19 
it has been further hypothesized that survival may be 
dependent on ability to replenish lymphocytes which are 
killed by the virus [28]. As such, lymphocyte count, espe￾cially CD4, may serve as a clinical predictor of severity 
and prognosis.
Biomarkers of cardiac and muscle injury were ele￾vated in patients with both severe and fatal COVID-19. 
Patients who died had significantly elevated cardiac tro￾ponin levels at presentation (WMD: 32.7 ng/L), thus sug￾gesting potential for viral myocarditis, cardiac injury from 
progression towards multiple organ failure (MOF), as well 
as secondary cardiac injury from organ targeted patholo￾gies (e.g. renal or liver failure). Combined with significant 
elevations in liver enzymes (alanine aminotransferase 
and aspartate aminotransferase), renal biomarkers (blood 
urea nitrogen, creatinine), and coagulation measures, a 
picture of MOF becomes very apparent in patients who 
develop the severe form of the disease, even with labora￾tory parameters measured primarily at admission.
With respect to immunologic biomarkers, signifi￾cantly greater increases were observed for IL-6 and serum 
ferritin in non-survivors vs. survivors (WMD: 4.6  pg/mL 
and 760.2 ng/mL, respectively) as compared to severe

vs. non-severe form (WMD: 1.7 pg/mL and 408.3 ng/mL, 
respectively). We suggest both parameters thus be used 
for monitoring prognosis in COVID-19 patients over the 
course of hospitalization. These elevations, along with 
elevated C-reactive protein (CRP), point to development 
of a systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) 
picture in patients with a severe form of the disease. The 
exaggerated elevation of inflammatory cytokines such as 
IL-6, which can lead to a so-called “cytokines storm,” may 
be a driver behind acute lung injury and ARDS and lead to 
other tissue damage progressing to MOF [29]. Additionally, 
elevated interleukin-10 (IL-10) was observed in patients 
with the severe form of the disease. We suspect this may 
be related to compensatory anti-inflammatory response 
(CARS), which may be responsible for higher number of 
secondary infections (50%) and sepsis (100%) reported in 
non-survivors [26].
Importantly, while this study investigated discrimina￾tive ability, measured as the WMD in a given laboratory 
parameter between patients with severe and non-severe 
form or non-survivors and survivors, a lack of a statisti￾cally significant or even clinically significant difference 
does not imply a lack of association with the outcome. For 
example, in this study, only a 0.2 ng/mL difference in pro￾calcitonin (PCT) level was observed between severe and 
non-severe forms of the disease. However, when we ana￾lyzed this in a prior study as a categorical variable, nearly 
a 5-fold higher risk of severe COVID-19 infection (OR, 
4.76; 95% CI, 2.74–8.29) was observed for patients who 
had elevated PCT [3]. While only minimal discriminative 
ability is observed for severity, and lack of data prevented 
this analysis for mortality, we postulate that elevated PCT 
may be driven by the 50% secondary infection rate seen 
in non-survivors versus only 1% survivors [26]. Moreover, 
this highlights that both discriminative ability and odds 
of severity are factors that must be considered in build￾ing predictive risk stratification models in COVID-19. As 
more categorical data becomes available for analysis in 
the coming weeks and months, this should be a priority 
for future analyses.
Several limitations of this study should be noted. As 
included studies used variable definitions to define sever￾ity, we were forced to employ a composite measure which 
may have accounted for some heterogeneity in the meta￾analysis. Six studies had unclear time points of laboratory 
collection, however, subgroup analysis excluding studies 
that did not use specifically admission laboratory meas￾urements yielded no significant differences. Due to the 
nature of reporting in the emerging outbreak, we did not 
perform a risk of bias assessment, and presume it to be 
high across studies. This should be taken into considera￾tion when interpreting results.
In addition, a major limitation of the evaluated studies 
is represented by the poor description of the analytical 
performance characteristics of the methods used and the 
adoption of different measurement units for results report￾ing. While patient overlap is possible between a few of the 
studies, after careful evaluation we estimated this to be 
present in <1% of the total sample. All studies were from 
East Asia, mostly from China. As such, as more data from 
other regions becomes available, it should be compared to 
this analysis as it cannot be excluded that the virus may 
interplay differently with genetic, epigenetic and even envi￾ronmental factors. Lastly, the sample size for the mortality 
cohort and for some variables in the severity cohort were 
limited. These should be further evaluated in future studies.
In conclusion, we identified many candidate vari￾ables for risk stratification models that may serve as 
clinical predictors of severe and fatal COVID-19. In hospi￾talized patients with respiratory distress, we recommend 
clinicians closely monitor WBC count, lymphocyte count, 
platelet count, IL-6 and serum ferritin as markers for 
potential progression to critical illness. PCT should be reg￾ularly measured to serve as a marker of secondary bacte￾rial infection, which is frequently found in non-survivors, 
thus mirroring earlier evidence garnered with SARS [30]. 
Lastly these findings should be continually re-evaluated 
in the coming months as more data becomes available in 
prospective cohorts, with longer follow-up.
