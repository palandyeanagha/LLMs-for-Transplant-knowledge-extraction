Abstract
Rituximab (RTX), a monoclonal antibody (mAb) against CD20, has been widely used for lymphoma therapy. RTX in
combination with cyclophosphamide /doxorubicin /vincristine /prednisone (R-CHOP) remains the standard frontline
regimen for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. However, suboptimal response and /or resistance to rituximab have
remained a challenge in the therapy of B-cell non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL). Novel agents are under active
clinical trials. This review will summarize the latest development in new mAbs against CD20, which include
second-generation mAbs, ofatumumab, veltuzumab (IMMU-106), ocrelizumab (PRO70769), and third-generation
mAbs, AME-133v (ocaratuzumab), PRO131921 and GA101 (obinutumumab).
Background
Rituximab (RTX), a monoclonal antibody (mAb)
against CD20, has been widely used for lymphoma
therapy [1-4]. RTX in combination with cyclophospha￾mide /doxorubicin /vincristine /prednisone (R-CHOP)
remains the standard frontline regimen for diffuse large
B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) [5,6]. However, suboptimal
response and /or resistance to rituximab have remained a
challenge in the therapy of B-cell non-Hodgkin’s lymph￾oma (NHL). Novel agents are under active clinical trials.
This review will summarize the latest development in
new mAbs against CD20.
Rituximab, the first-generation CD20
monoclonal antibody
CD20 is the first B-cell specific antigen defined by the
monoclonal antibody tositumomab [7,8]. Human CD20
is encoded by the gene MS4A1 gene located on chromo￾some 11q12.2 [9]. CD20 molecule is a 297 amino acid
phosphoprotein with four transmembrane domains
(Figure 1). It plays a critical role in B-cell development.
CD20 has been a superb biomarker for immunotherapies
targeting B-cell derived diseases [10]. It is known to
function through binding to Src family tyrosine kinases,
such as Lyn, Fyn, and Lck, and believed to be involved
as a result in phosphorylation cascade of intracellular
proteins. It is a tetra-transmembrane protein that essen￾tially remains on the membrane of B cells without dis￾sociation or internalization upon antibody binding
(Figure 2) [11]. RTX, the first generation CD20 mAb,
can induce complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC)
and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC),
leading to its clinical activity against lymphoma cells
[12]. CDC represents the primary mechanism for cell￾killing by RTX. However, some lymphoid cells ( i.e. 10%
of CLL cells) were resistant to CDC because of lower
levels of complement activation or decreased cytotox￾icity of activated complements. In addition, RTX can
lead to apoptosis of B cells upon binding to CD20 and
therefore can directly inhibit cell growth [13]. Recently,
a novel mechanism of cell killing by mAbs was reported
to involve reactive oxygen species mediated through
NADPH [14].
RTX has been widely used for lymphoma therapy
[1-4,15-17]. R-CHOP chemotherapy remains the stand￾ard regimen for newly diagnosed DLBCL [3,5,18].
CD20 mAbs conjugated to nuclear isotopes have also
been approved for lymphoma therapy [18-22]. RTX
has also been studied in new combination regimens,
particularly for relapsed and refractory lymphomas
[23-31].
To increase antitumor activity and Fc binding affinity
for the low-affinity FcγRIIIa receptor (CD16) on immune
effector cells, new generations of anti-CD20 monoclonal
antibodies (mAbs) are being developed [7,8,11].

Second-generation anti-CD20 mAbs
The second-generation anti-CD20 mAbs include ofatu￾mumab, veltuzumab, and ocrelizumab. These are huma￾nized to reduce immunogenicity.
Ofatumumab (OFA) is a fully human type I anti-CD20
IgG1kappa mAb [15,32-37]. Ofatumumab binds to both
the small and large extracellular loops (ECL) of CD20
molecule, and is more effective than rituximab at killing
target cells. It has been shown to be more potent than
RTX against both RTX- sensitive and resistant cells [38].
Its activity against RTX-resistant cells and the potent
CDC effect are believed to be due to the proximal epi￾tope of the small loop of CD20 molecule and the high
capacity for C1q activation.
OFA (arzerra) has been approved for treatment of
relapsed or refractory CLL who have failed fludarabine
and alemtuzumab (FA-ref ) [39]. OFA is given IV
weekly on a fixed dose, 300 mg for dose 1, and 2000 mg
weekly x 7 in subsequent doses. This is followed by
every four weeks for 4 more doses [36]. In FA-ref CLL
patients, the response rate was 58%. OFA was also stud￾ied in 116 patients with RTX-refractory follicular lymph￾oma (FL) [40]. These patients received 8 weekly
infusions (dose 1, 300 mg and doses 2–8, 500 or 1000
mg). The median age was 61 years, and the median
number of prior therapies was 4. The overall response
rate (ORR) was 13% and 10% for the 500-mg and 1000-
mg arms, respectively (Table 1). The median PFS was

5.8 months. Infections, rash, urticaria, fatigue, and prur￾itus were the most common adverse events. Severe ad￾verse events included neutropenia, anemia, and
thrombocytopenia in a subset of patients.
OFA is being explored in combination with other
agents in various B-cell neoplasms. An international,
phase II trial was conducted to assess two doses of
ofatumumab combined with CHOP (O-CHOP) for
frontline treatment for follicular lymphoma [41]. The
study randomized 59 patients to receive either OFA
500 mg (n = 29) or 1000 mg (n = 30) on day 1, with
CHOP on day 3 every 3 weeks for six cycles. ORR
was 90% for the 500-mg group and 100% for the
1000-mg group (Table 1). CR/CRu was 62%. The
most common severe adverse events were leucopenia
(29%) and neutropenia (22%). O-CHOP was reported
to be safe and effective as frontline therapy for FL
patients.
Another international randomized phase II trial was
done using OFA in combination with fludarabine 25
mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide 250 mg/m2 on days 2–4
in course 1 and on days 1–3 for courses 2–6 [35]. This
was repeated every 4 weeks for 6 courses. Two OFA
dose levels, 500 mg (n = 31) or 1000 mg (n = 30), were
given to patients with untreated CLL after
randomization. The first OFA dose was 300 mg for both
cohorts. The median age of the study pts was 56 years;
17p deletion was seen in 13% of patients. CR rate was
32% for the 500-mg and 50% for the 1000-mg cohort.
ORR was 77% and 73%, respectively. Beta2-microglobulin
and the number of O-FC courses given correlated sig￾nificantly with CR, ORR, PFS, according to univariate
analyses (P < .05). Neutropenia (48%), thrombocytopenia
(15%), anemia (13%), and infection (8%) were found
to be the most common severe adverse events. The
study concluded that O-FC is active and safe in
treatment-naive CLL patients, including high-risk
patients with 17p deletion.
Veltuzumab (IMMU-106, hA20) has more potent
binding avidities and a stronger effect on CDC than
rituximab [44]. Veltuzumab is a humanized, type I anti￾CD20 IgG1 mAb, engineered recombinantly with
complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) identical
to rituximab, except for a single amino acid change,
Asp101 instead of Asn101, in the CDR3 of the variable
heavy chain [10,44]. This modification results in signifi￾cantly slower off-rates and increased CDC cytotoxicity
in three human lymphoma cell lines. Clinically, veltuzu￾mab has been studied in over 150 patients with lymph￾omas and autoimmune diseases. In a multicenter
phase I/II dose-finding study of veltuzumab in relapsed/
refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL),
eighty-two patients (median age, 64 years; 79% stage III/
IV, one to nine prior treatments) received infusions of
80–750 mg/m2 once-weekly for four doses, with no
grade 3 to 4 drug-related adverse events other than
infusion-related reactions [42]. Complete response (CR)
was seen in 27% of FL patients despite failure of two to
five prior rituximab-containing regimens. ORR for FL,
MZL, and DLBCL was 44%, 83%, and 43%, respectively
(table 1). The median duration of responses was 19.7
months. B cell depletion was seen at all dose levels stud￾ied. The depletion occurred after the first infusion. The
veltuzumab serum half-lives were similar after the fourth
infusion, and mean antibody serum levels were higher
than the values generally considered important for anti￾CD20 therapy (i.e., 25 mg/ml). Subcutaneous injections
of low doses (80–320 mg) were also studied and have
also proved to be safe and pharmacologically active [45].
Ocrelizumab (PRO70769) is another type I second
generation humanized mAb that differs from rituximab
at several amino acid positions within the CDRs of the
light chain and heavy chain variable regions. With
enhanced efficacy toward lymphoid malignancies and
increased binding affinity for the low-affinity variants of
the FcγRIIIa receptor (CD16), this mAb has increased

ADCC and lower CDC activity compared with rituxi￾mab. This mAb has been evaluated in a phase I/II
study for safety and efficacy in patients with relapsed/
refractory follicular lymphoma (FL) after failing prior
RTX therapy [43]. Forty-seven patients were enrolled in
three dose cohorts and received eight infusions every
3 weeks: cohort A, 200 mg/ m2 (n = 15); cohort B,
375 mg/ m2 (n = 16); cohort C, first dose 375 mg/ m2
with seven subsequent doses at 750 mg/ m2 (n = 16).
The patients had a median age of 58 years and had
received a median of 2 (range 1–6) prior regimens. The
grade 3/4 toxicity occurred in 9% of patients. The most
common toxicity was infusion-related reactions which
occurred in 74% of the patients. The ORR was 38% re￾gardless of affinity variants in the FcγRIIIa. The median
follow-up was approximately 28 months, and the median
PFS was 11.4 months.
Third-generation anti-CD20 mAbs
The third-generation humanized CD-20 mAbs have an
engineered Fc region to increase their binding affinity
for the FcγRIIIa receptor. Three third-generation mAbs,
AME-133v, PRO131921 and GA101, are undergoing ac￾tive clinical development.
AME-133v (LY2469298, ocaratuzumab) is a type I,
humanized IgG1 mAb. Its binding affinity to CD20 has a
13 to 20- fold increase with 5 to 7- fold higher avidity to
the low-affinity (F/F and F/V) variants of FcγRIIIa recep￾tor. These may have been the mechanisms to overcome
the lower response rates and shorter duration of
responses to rituximab. A phase I study was done with
dose escalation in 10 Japanese patients with relapsed and
/or refractory FL. It was administered by intravenous in￾fusion at 100 or 375 mg/m2 weekly for 4 weeks. Nine
patients were F-carriers while one was homozygous
for valine (V/V) at position 158 of FcγRIIIa. There
were no dose-limiting toxicities. Five (50%) of ten
patients responded to ocaratuzumab treatment (three
CR, one unconfirmed CR and one partial response).
Ocaratuzumab was well tolerated and clinical activity
was observed in FL patients pretreated with rituximab,
mostly consisting of F-carriers [46]. Another phase I
dose escalation study from US has also been reported in
23 relapsed FL patients. The dosages were well tolerated
from 2 up to 375 mg/m2 [47]. This highest dose was
used in a phase II trial in 44 patients with relapsed FL
following prior rituximab[48]. These patients with the
low-affinity FcγRIIIa polymorphism (F-carriers) received
375 mg/m2 of ocaratuzumab weekly for 4 doses. The
ORR was 36% and median progression free survival
(PFS) reached 91 weeks (Table 2). In this analysis, there
were 56 patients who received 100 and 375 mg/m2 of
ocaratuzumab. Eight of these patients had a median of 2
prior rituximab treatments (range 1–6). Five of the 8
patients showed a longer PFS after ocaratuzumab ad￾ministration, compared with last rituximab treatment.
These 5 patients had the F/F low-affinity genotype of
FcγRIIIa. Three of the patients had prolonged remission
[48]. Ocaratuzumab will need to be compared to rituxi￾mab in randomized clinical trials to substantiate its po￾tential clinical advantages.
PRO131921 is another humanized anti-CD20 mAb
recombinantly engineered for enhanced CDC and
ADCC activities over RTX [15,52,53]. In preclinical
in vivo studies, it was shown to have better anti-tumor
efficacy than rituximab. PRO131921 was given to
patients (pts) with relapsed and /or refractory indolent
lymphoma who failed rituximab-containing regimen
[51]. This phase I study determined the maximum toler￾ated dose (MTD) and the pharmacokinetics (PK).
PRO131921 was infused weekly for 4 weeks on days 1, 8,
15 and 22. The dose of the first infusion was half of sub￾sequent infusions. Twenty-four pts were treated with
PRO131921 at doses escalated from 25 mg/m2 to 800
mg/m2
. A median of 2 (range 1-6) prior regimens were
found in these pts. PRO131921 had no MTD in this
study. The most common adverse events were infusion￾related reactions, limited mostly to the first infusion.

Dose limiting toxicity (DLT) included a significant infu￾sion reaction and grade 3 joint pain and fatigue after 2
infusions. There was a correlation between drug expos￾ure and tumor shrinkage (p=0.049) as well as clinical
response (p=0.034). This suggested that drug clearance
(e.g. by tumor in excess of drug) is proportional to
clinical efficacy. Twenty two of the 24 pts were evaluable
at the time of report in 2009. There were 6 partial re￾sponse (PR 27%), 13 stable disease (SD), and 3 disease
progression (PD). Half of 10 pts in the two highest dose
cohorts responded. Further clinical trials are underway.
GA101 (RO5072759, obinutuzumab) is a fully huma￾nized, type II, IgG1 mAb derived from humanization of
the parental B-Ly1 mouse antibody and subsequent gly￾coengineering of Fc region [54-57]. GA101 binds CD20
through a totally different orientation than rituximab
and over a larger epitope. It appears to have more potent
activity through direct killing as well as NK-cell
mediated ADCC effect. GA101 was shown to have activ￾ity in RTX-resistant cell lines [58,59].
In an open label multicenter, phase I/II study, GA101
was evaluated in patients with relapsed /refractory CD20
+ NHL/CLL[60]. In the non-randomized dose-escalating
phase I (3 + 3 design), 21 patients were treated with
GA101 (50–2,000 mg) on days 1 and 8 of cycle 1, and
day 1 in cycles 2–8 (21-day cycles). ORR was 56%
(CR=31%, PR=25%). In the phase II part of the study,
patients with indolent NHL were randomized to one of
two doses: 1,600/800 mg (n = 22, ORR 60%), or 400/400
mg (n = 18, ORR 35%). The median follow-up time was
23.1 months. The median PFS for patients with FL was
11.8 months for the high-dose cohort, and 6.0 months
for the low dose cohort (HR: 0.77 [95% CI 0.34–1.77).
The most common adverse events (AE) were infusion￾related reactions (400/400 mg: 72%; 1,600/800 mg: 73%).
Responses were also seen among the 5 patients who
were retreated with GA101. PK data from the studies
have suggested that responding patients metabolize
GA101 more slowly than non-responders [61].
Obinutuzumab (GA101) in combination with cyclo￾phosphamide /doxorubicin /vincristine /prednisone (G￾CHOP) or fludarabine /cyclophosphamide (G-FC) has
been studied in patients with CD20+ relapsed/refractory
FL in an open-label, multicenter, randomized Phase Ib
study (BO21000). Response rates were 94% for G-CHOP
and 93% for G-FC. Serum levels of GA101 from these
pts receiving combination chemotherapies were mea￾sured by ELISA. GA101 PK data were reported [50]. The
serum concentrations of GA101 corresponded to the
GA101 dose level that pts received, regardless of chemo￾therapy arm.
GA101 represents the first third-generation type II gly￾coengineered CD20 mAb which entered randomized
phase II/III clinical trials. GA101 was compared to RTX
in a randomized phase II study in CLL/NHL patients
[62]. In this study, a total of 175 pts (149 FL) were ran￾domized to receive 4 weekly infusions of either GA101
(1000 mg, n=87) or rituximab (375 mg/m2
, n=88). Main￾tenance treatment with GA101 or rituximab every 2
months for up to 2 years at the same dose was given to
responders. ORR was the primary endpoint in the FL
population. In this population, ORR for GA101 was 43.2
(32/74) v 38.7 (29/75) for rituximab. The CR/CRu rate
was 10.8 in the GA101 arm v 6.7 for rituximab. There￾fore, this first head to head trial of GA101 against RTX
demonstrated higher ORR and similar adverse events.
Phase III trials of GA101 in combination with chemo￾therapy are ongoing.
Conclusions and future directions
Although RTX and newer mAbs against CD20 have
revolutionized lymphoma therapy, a significant popula￾tion of patients still succumbs to lymphomas. Novel
agents with different mechanism of actions are being
explored [63-76]. Bortezomib is an active agent for re￾fractory mantle cell and other lymphomas [77-85]. Lena￾lidomide, an immunomodulatory agent, has been
studied for lymphoma therapy [67,86]. mTOR inhibitors,
everolimus and temsirolimus, are being studied for treat￾ment of refractory and relapsed lymphomas [87-94].
New biomarkers, such as microRNAs, STATs and Tregs,
appear to be useful for assisting lymphoma diagnosis and
for developing new therapeutic agents [65,74,75,95-97].
Novel antibodies directed against lymphocyte-specific
antigens, such as CD19 [98-101], CD22 [102-112], and
CD30 [113-116], have shown promises for clinical appli￾cations. Combination regimens among these novel
agents may provide further improvement on the outcome
of lymphoma therapy.
