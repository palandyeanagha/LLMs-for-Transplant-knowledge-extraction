Abstract
Background: MultiCellular Tumor Spheroid (MCTS) mimics the organization of a tumor and is considered as an
invaluable model to study cancer cell biology and to evaluate new antiproliferative drugs. Here we report how the
characteristics of MCTS in association with new technological developments can be used to explore the
regionalization and the activation of cell cycle checkpoints in 3D.
Methods: Cell cycle and proliferation parameters were investigated in Capan-2 spheroids by immunofluorescence
staining, EdU incorporation and using cells engineered to express Fucci-red and -green reporters.
Results: We describe in details the changes in proliferation and cell cycle parameters during spheroid growth and
regionalization. We report the kinetics and regionalized aspects of cell cycle arrest in response to checkpoint
activation induced by EGF starvation, lovastatin treatment and etoposide-induced DNA damage.
Conclusion: Our data present the power and the limitation of spheroids made of genetically modified cells to
explore cell cycle checkpoints. This study paves the way for the investigation of molecular aspects and dynamic
studies of the response to novel antiproliferative agents in 3D models.

Background
Models that closely mimic human cancer are essential for
the understanding of the intimate growth mechanisms
and for the development of new treatments. MultiCellular
Tumor Spheroid (MCTS) is a 3D model that accurately
reproduces the organization of a microtumor, recapitulat￾ing cell-cell and cell-microenvironment interactions [1,2].
While growing, spheroids display a gradient of proliferating
cells that are located in the outer cell-layers whereas the
quiescent cells are located more centrally. This cell hetero￾geneity is similar to what is found in microregions of a
tumor [2-4]. It is now widely accepted that MultiCellular
Tumor Spheroids accurately reproduce the 3D architecture
of solid tumors, filling the gap between monolayer cultured
cells and animal models, and their interest as evaluation
models for new anti-cancer strategies is increasingly
recognized [4,5]. A number of reports indicate that
evaluation performed with MCTS is rather predictive of
the efficiency of new antitumor compounds in patients and
has proven in numerous studies to be of tremendous inter￾est in characterizing the effects of chemotherapeutics [6].
In that context, MCTS models are particularly interesting
as they reproduce the multicellular resistance (MCR)
associated to cell-cell interaction, low drug penetration, re￾sistance of quiescent cells located in the deepest and hyp￾oxic regions [5].
Cell cycle progression is driven by cyclin-CDK (cyclin￾dependent kinases) complexes the activities of which
being controlled by several activators and inhibitors in￾cluding CDK inhibitors (CKI), the polo-like and Aurora
kinases as well as the CDC25 phosphatases. In response
to DNA injuries or to DNA replication or chromo￾somes segregation defects, signaling pathways, named
checkpoints, are activated. This activation results in cell
cycle arrest through direct or indirect CDK inhibition,
thus allowing cells to repair these defects, thereby
protecting cells from genomic instability [7,8]. Numer￾ous proteins implicated in the control of the cell cycle

progression have been found to be mutated or
misregulated in human tumors [7-9]. Moreover, the
function of checkpoint proteins and their regulators are
often found disrupted in tumor cells. As a consequence,
cell cycle deregulation is a common feature of human
cancer [10] and cancer cells are frequently characterized
by unscheduled proliferation and accumulation of gen￾omic instability. New therapeutics strategies that aim at
targeting the cell cycle machinery and its checkpoints
are currently of a major interest. Cyclin-Dependent
Kinases and their cyclin regulatory subunits, as well as
other relevant cell cycle regulators have been the focus
of intensive efforts to identify selective inhibitory
compounds [9,11-14]. Another promising approach to￾ward cell cycle regulatory mechanisms is to target cell
cycle checkpoint that ensure maintenance of the genome
integrity [15,16]. In line with this, as we recently
reported, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cell lines￾derived MCTS can be used to evaluate the spatio￾temporal effect of the combination between gemcitabine
and a checkpoint kinase 1 inhibitor, CHIR-124 [17].
The use of MCTS in the evaluation and in the pre￾clinical development of new compounds targeting the
cell cycle and checkpoint machineries strengthen the
need for a better knowledge of the proliferation
parameters in such 3D models, and for the engineering
of innovative new evaluation models that could provide
additional information on the effect of the evaluated
compounds on cell cycle progression in 3D. How are
proliferation markers expression and distribution in the
different cell cycle phases modulated in the different
regions of a multicellular tumor spheroid remains poorly
known.
In this study, we characterized the cell cycle parameters
change in 3D by using pancreatic MCTS models engineered
to express cell cycle fluorescent reporters. We report that
these MCTS models allow monitoring the activation of cell
cycle checkpoints in 3D, thus providing innovative strategies
for the evaluation of new antitumor drugs targeting cell
cycle regulation.
Methods
Cell culture
Capan-2 pancreatic cancer cells stably expressing the
Fucci-G1 red or the Fucci-S/G2/M green were kindly
provided by Dr P. Cordelier [17]. These cell lines were
cultured in DMEM/F12 glutamax (Invitrogen, France)
containing 10% FCS and penicillin/streptomycin in a hu￾midified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37°C.
Spheroid generation and culture
Spheroids were prepared as previously described [17].
Briefly, 1000 cells/well in DMEM/F12 (Invitrogen,
France) supplemented with EGF (20 ng/ml, Invitrogen)
and B27 (1x, Invitrogen) were distributed in poly￾HEMA-coated 96-round bottom well plates. Plates were
subjected to centrifugation (6 min, 800 g) and then
placed in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37°C.
To obtain quiescent spheroids, EGF was removed by
washing 400 μm in diameter spheroids three times with
media containing 10% FCS and then incubated with this
media without EGF and B27 for 1–6 days.
Immunofluorescence on frozen sections
Spheroids were fixed for 2-3 h with formalin (Sigma),
then washed with PBS and stored at 4°C. After fixation,
spheroids were processed for 5 μm frozen sections.
Spheroids were incubated in 15% then 30% sucrose in
PBS for 24 h at 4°C, and were then embedded in Tissue￾Tek, (Sakura Finetek) before sectioning. Sections were
incubated with antibodies directed against Ki67 (rabbit
polyclonal, Santa Cruz, 1 μg/ml), phosphorylated￾HistoneH3 (rabbit polyclonal, Upstate, 1 μg/ml), Cyclin
A (mouse monoclonal, Abcam, 1/50), Cyclin B (mouse
monoclonal, Abcam, 0,6 μg/ml), Cyclin D1 (rabbit
monoclonal, Spring, 1/100) or Cyclin E (rabbit, mono￾clonal, Epitomics, 1/250) overnight at 4°C. After washes
in PBS/Triton 0.1% v/v, the secondary antibody was ap￾plied (Alexa 488-anti-mouse or Alexa 594-anti-rabbit,
Molecular Probes, 1/800, for 1 h at room temperature).
DNA was stained using DAPI.
EdU labelling of spheroids
EdU labelling was performed by using the Click-itW EdU
Alexa FluorW imaging kit (Molecular Probes). Briefly,
EdU (5-ethynyl-2´-deoxyuridine) is a thymidine analog
that is incorporated in DNA during DNA synthesis. EdU
detection relies on a simple and quick click reaction, a
copper-catalyzed covalent reaction between an azide and
an alkyne, that do not necessitate a DNA denaturation
step like BdrU detection. In this application, the EdU
contains the alkyne and the Alexa FluorW dye contains
the azide. EdU was added to the culture media to a
10 μM final concentration. After a 24 h incubation,
spheroids were rinsed in PBS and then fixed. EdU detec￾tion, based on a click reaction between EdU and Alexa
FLuorW 488 or 594 dye, was performed following
manufacturer's instructions.
Hypoxia detection
Hypoxia detection was performed by using Hypoxy￾probe™-1 Plus kit (HPI). Pimonidazole hypochloride
(Hypoxyprobe-1)™ was added to the culture media to a
100 μM final concentration for 2 h at 37°C. Pimonidazole
forms stable adducts with proteins in hypoxic cells. After
fixation, spheroids were processed for frozen sections and
pimonidazole adducts were detected by incubating sections
with FITC conjugated MAb1 (monoclonal antibody

provided, 1/300) for 2 h at 37°C. After PBS washes, DNA
was stained using DAPI.
Pharmacological treatments
Spheroids measuring 350-400 μm in diameter were
treated by adding lovastatin (10 μM, Mevinolin, Sigma)
or etoposide (1 μM or 5 μM, Sigma) to the culture
medium. At the indicated time after treament (24 h or
48 h), spheroids were fixed for 2-3 hrs with formalin
(Sigma), then washed with PBS and stored at 4°C.
Images acquisition and analysis
Fluorescence images from spheroid sections were acquired
using a DM5000 (Leica) epifluorescence microscope, fitted
with a Roper COOLsnap ES CCD camera coupled using a
C-mount 0.63X adapter. Using a 20X objective, the final
magnification was 12.5X and allows visualizing entire
sections of small and large spheroids in the field of view
with image quality high enough for subsequent analyses.
Images were processed using Metamorph and ImageJ
softwares. To quantify the percentage of Fucci-expressing
cells depending on the distance to the spheroid surface,
images were analyzed using the Cellomics Technologies
software (Compartimental Bioapplication-Thermo Scien￾tific). Briefly, all the nuclei from each section were
segmented based on DAPI fluorescence. Then, the x and y
coordinates and the fluorescence intensity corresponding to
Fucci-Red or Fucci-Green channels were automatically
extracted for each individualized object. The same thresh￾old was used to identify Fucci-expressing cells on all the
spheroid sections from a single experiment. Numeric values
were processed using Microsoft Excel and Prism software
packages. For each section, the percentage of positive cells
at a given distance was calculated by dividing the number
of Fucci-expressing cells by the total number of nuclei
included in the indicated range of distance. For each condi￾tion, 20 to 30 sections from 8 to 10 spheroids from 2 to 3
independent experiments were analyzed.
Results
Growing Capan-2 spheroids display a proliferation
gradient
Our first aim was to examine how regionalization of
proliferation parameters occurs in Capan-2 multicellular
tumor spheroids. To address this issue we selected two
representative spheroid growth stages that will subse￾quently be referred to in this work as small and large
spheroids. These stages correspond to spheroids of an
average diameter of 300–350 μm and 500–600 μm, re￾spectively. The experiments reported below were
performed and strictly restricted to spheroid sections
that were identified as closely passing through the spher￾oid center.
We first assessed proliferation using Ki-67 immuno￾fluorescence staining procedure. The Ki-67 antigen is a
marker of cell proliferation widely used to evaluate the
proliferation index in tissue biopsies [18]. As shown in
Figure 1A small spheroids display a homogeneous Ki-67
positive cells distribution pattern, while in contrast on
large spheroids Ki-67 positive cells staining is restricted
to the outmost cell layers. This first result illustrates the
notion of an existing proliferation gradient that is ini￾tially absent and develops as multicellular tumor
spheroids grow.
To refine this analysis, we sought to visualize the
population of cells that are engaged in cell cycle progres￾sion and therefore undergoing S-phase replication. To
this aim we performed EdU (5-ethynyl-2´-deoxyuridine)
incorporation for 24 h. EdU is a nucleoside analog to
thymidine that is incorporated in DNA during replica￾tion and is therefore a functional marker of actively
proliferating cells. As shown in Figure 1B, while in small
spheroids staining was observed in the whole volume, a
clear regionalization was observed in large spheroids
with EdU incorporation restricted to the outmost layers.
In such large spheroid quantification of the percentage
of EdU positive cells (Figure 1C) as a function of the dis￾tance to the spheroid surface displays a progressive de￾crease of the proportion of proliferative cells from the
surface to the center of the spheroid. This experiment
shows that approximately 60% of cells have undergone
S-phase over the last 24 h and can be considered as ac￾tively proliferating in the outer 40 μm of the spheroid.
Strikingly, in the same conditions one can also observe a
rapid decrease with less than 20% of cells that had
undergone DNA replication 150 μm away from the
spheroid surface and the absence of any EdU positive
cell in the center of the spheroid.
Finally, we also examined whether the observed
regionalization of Ki67 and EdU staining matched the
hypoxia gradient that progressively takes place in growing
spheroids. Indeed, as shown in Figure 1D, while no hyp￾oxia is detected in small spheroids, a strong Pimonidazole
staining is observed in large spheroids and its
regionalization matches those of the proliferation
parameters.
Cell cycle regionalization within growing Capan-2
spheroids
The observed regionalization of Ki-67 staining and EdU
incorporation in large spheroids indicates that the ability
of cells to progress in the cell cycle is dependent on their
position to the spheroid surface and suggests that ex￾pression of cell cycle regulatory proteins might be
dependent on that parameter. We therefore explored
systematically cyclins expression, which is representative
of the distinct phases of cell cycle, and of phospho￾Laurent et al. BMC Cancer 2013, 13:73 Page 3 of 12

histone H3 to detect mitotic cells on small and large
spheroids sections. In Figure 2, from top to bottom are
presented staining observed for cyclin D1, cyclin E, cyc￾lin A, cyclin B and phospho-Histone H3.
Cyclin levels are known to mirror the progression of a
cell within the cell cycle. As expected, in small spheroids
mainly constituted of actively proliferating cells, all four
cyclins were highly expressed, with level variations
reflecting their position in the cell cycle. In contrast, large
and regionalized spheroids displayed an expression pat￾tern of all cyclins that mirrored the proliferation gradient
reported above. Finally, detection of phosphorylated his￾tone H3 allowed the detection of mitotic cells that are
evenly spread in small spheroids and again restricted to
the outer layers in large spheroids.
All together these observations led us next to investi￾gate whether and how cell cycle distribution was a par￾ameter subjected to changes upon spheroid growth and
in various layers of a large spheroid. To address that
question in a more systematic and quantitative manner
than immunostaining detection, we developed spheroid
models expressing Fucci (Fluorescence Ubiquitination
Cell Cycle Indicators) tools that allow monitoring cell
cycle position of a cell [19]. Fucci-red (Cdt1-mKO2) is
expressed and stable in G1 cells, while Fucci-green
(Geminin-mAG) marks S- and G2-phases. We cloned
these constructs and prepared lentiviruses particles that
were used to transduce and establish stable Capan-2 cell
lines expressing these fluorescent fusion proteins [17].
To validate the cell cycle regulation of these reporters in
3D MCTS, dynamics of Fucci-green and –red expression
was examined by co-immunostaining with cyclin anti￾bodies on small and large spheroids. No Fucci-green
positive cells (i.e. S-G2-M cells) were found to express
the G1-phase cyclins D or E, and no Fucci-red positive
cells (i.e. G1 cells) were found to express the G2-phase
cyclins A or B (see Additional file 1).
Figure 3A and 3C present typical wide field fluores￾cence microscopy images of spheroids sections illustrat￾ing the distribution of Fucci-red and Fucci-green in
small and large spheroids. As shown, an even distribu￾tion of both markers is observed in small spheroids,
while a clear gradient of both Fucci-red and Fucci-green
is detected in large spheroids. These results were

quantified by determining the percentage of Fucci-red
and Fucci-green positive cells as a function of the dis￾tance to the spheroid surface. These graphs drawn at the
same scale for small and large spheroids clearly illustrate
the fact that G1-phase cells are evenly spread in small
spheroids (average 50% of positive cells), while in large
spheroids a gradient is observed with a noticeable decay
approximately 150 μm away from the cell surface
(Figure 3B). The percentage of Fucci green cells (i.e. S,
G2 and mitosis) is less homogenously distributed in
small spheroids with a progressive decrease, while in
large spheroids the percentage of positive cells is
reduced and no detectable Fucci-green positive cells are
observed approximately 120–150 μm away from the sur￾face (Figure 3D).
Altogether, these data indicate that the proliferative
zone of a spheroid is restricted to the outer 150 μm
where Ki-67 staining is positive and EdU incorporation
occurs. Indeed cells are apparently able to efficient cell
cycle commitment and to proceed in S-phase in this
area only, confirming the above results. These
experiments further underline the importance of the
growth regionalization aspect occurring upon MCTS
growth when investigating cell cycle checkpoint in 3D
using a drug that impairs cell cycle progression.
Lovastatin-induced cell cycle arrest in G1
Lovastatin inhibition of mevalonate synthesis results in
farnesyl- and geranylgeranyl-pyrophosphate deprivation
that ultimately causes an inactivation of Ras and Rho.
It has been demonstrated that up-regulation of p27
mediated by the reduction of Rho geranylgeranylation is
responsible for the inhibition of CDK2 activity and conse￾quently for the arrest of the cell cycle at the G1-phase
[20,21]. Accordingly, we observed that treatment of a 2D
monolayer culture of Capan-2 cells expressing Fucci with
lovastatin (60 μM) results in an efficient cell cycle arrest
in G1 (85%) with about 90% of Fucci-red and 10% of
Fucci-green cells (see Additional file 2). In order to valid￾ate that Fucci-red or Fucci-green expressing Capan-2
MCTS could allow evaluating an arrest of the cell cycle at
the G1-phase, we analyzed the variation of Fucci reporters’
expression induced by a Lovastatin treatment.
When applied on spheroids, we find that lovastatin
treatment impairs growth in a dose-dependent manner
with an IC50 of 5 μM and induces cell death with
spheroid collapse at high concentration. We therefore
examined the effect of 5 μM (data not shown) and
10 μM lovastatin after 24 h and 48 h treatment of Fucci￾red or –green spheroids. As illustrated with the
micrographs shown in Figure 4A and the quantification
shown in Figure 4B, the percentage of Fucci-green cells
decreases over time while an increase in Fucci-red posi￾tive cells is detected. At 48 h, we observe a nearly 40%
reduction of Fucci-green positive in the outmost region
of the spheroid and in parallel in the same region the
percentage of Fucci-red positive cells increases from
57% to 68%. Thus, albeit about 15% of Fucci-green cells
are still detected after 48 h, a high level of Fucci-red
positive cells indicative of an arrest in G1 is observed in
the outmost proliferative layers.
Monitoring G2/M checkpoint activation in MCTS treated
with etoposide
Etoposide (VP-16) is a topoisomerase inhibitor that can
be used to induce DNA damage and activate cell cycle
checkpoint. As this is the case with many other cell
lines, a one hour treatment with 40 μM etoposide results
after a 24 h release in the massive accumulation of
Capan-2 cells at the G2/M checkpoint that can be
detected either by flow cytometry or by the observation
of the accumulation of 90% of Fucci-green positive cells
with a very low residual percentage of Fucci-red (see
Additional file 2).
Since it is not technically possible to wash away
etoposide from a treated spheroid, we used continuous
treatment with a 1 μM and 5 μM concentration for 24 h
and 48 h. The micrographs of spheroids treated for 48 h
(Figure 5A) illustrate the decrease in Fucci-red cells with
a concomitant increase in Fucci-green cells percentage.
As presented in the quantitation of these experiments
shown in Figure 5B, while modestly affected at 24 h,
after a 48 h treatment with 5 μM the percentage of
Fucci-green positive cells increases by approximately
two-fold (25% to 45%) and in parallel the percentage of
Fucci-red positive cells drops from 60% to 30%. Strik￾ingly, this effect is observed up to 120 μm deep in the
spheroid. Phospho H2AX staining was used to detect
DNA damage and confirmed the presence of numerous
positive cells in the whole volume of the spheroid, thus
indicating that etoposide has penetrated in the spheroid
(see Additional file 3). One can therefore conclude that
(See figure on previous page.)

3–4 different spheroids.

etoposide treatment of 3D MCTS efficiently activates a
DNA damage checkpoint resulting in a global change in
cell cycle distribution of the outmost layers of the
spheroid.
Cell cycle arrest in G1 and G2 in response to EGF removal
In order to investigate growth factor starvation effect on
cell cycle parameters in MCTS we referred to our recent
observation of the dependence of Capan-2 spheroid
growth on the presence of EGF [17]. In that context,
EGF deprivation effect on cell cycle progression can only
be explored within 3D MCTS as Capan-2 cells
proliferate in the absence of EGF when grown as 2D
monolayer. Capan-2 Fucci-red or –green expressing
spheroids grown in DMEM/F12 media were deprived of
EGF in the presence of 10% serum and monitored over
6 days. EdU incorporation was performed every day for
a 24 h duration to assess the ability of the cells to enter
S-phase during that time.
As shown in Figure 6A (left panels) EdU incorporation
is totally abolished after 6 days indicating that most cells
are likely in a quiescent stage i.e. in a prolonged cell
cycle arrest. Quantification of the evolution of EdU in￾corporation overtime as a function of the distance to the
cell surface is presented in Figure 6B (top). As shown,
there is virtually no EdU incorporation after 5 days and
a major decrease is already detected in EGF-deprived
spheroids at day 2 in the deepest layers and at day 3 on
the outer layers.
According to the classical view of cell cycle regulation
such result suggests that upon growth factor removal
cycling cells are unable to progress in G1, do not pass
the restriction point and are arrested in G1 prior to
enter a quiescent state. We examined this hypothesis by
looking at the distribution of the percentage of Fucci-red
and Fucci-green cells in the proliferative zone of the
spheroid during this 6 days experiment. As presented in
the micrographs shown in Figure 6A (middle and right
panels) both the percentage of Fucci-red and Fucci￾green positive cells are diminished after 6 days. The
quantification presented in Figure 6B shows that per￾centage of Fucci-green (i.e. S and G2 cells) progressively
dropped and is decreased by a two-fold factor after 6 -
days. However, unexpectedly about 15% of positive
Fucci-green cells are still detected at day 6, while as
indicated above EdU incorporation is totally abolished.
The evolution of the percentage of Fucci-red positive
cells is different. During the first three days, this per￾centage increases as compared to control spheroid, indi￾cating that cells are accumulating in G1-phase. However,
at days 5 and 6 we observe a major decrease in the per￾centage of Fucci-red positive cells, illustrating the entry
of the cells in a quiescent stage accompanied by the loss
of Fucci-red expression, that reproduces the decrease of
the level of the endogenous Cdt1 protein in the same
conditions (data not shown).
Our results strongly suggest that epidermal growth
factor removal slows down cell cycle progression not
only in G1 but also in G2. The progressive changes in
Fucci-green and –red cells percentage thus would likely
reflect a combined effect and its progressive consequences
on the cell cycle distribution.
Discussion
This work presents, to our knowledge, the first descrip￾tion of cell cycle parameters in 3D MCTS from the
Capan-2 pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell line. We dem￾onstrate that classical immunological reagents, as well as
engineered cell lines with Fucci reporters can be used to
precisely describe in "cell cycle words" the complex
regionalization that is observed upon spheroid growth in
situ. We showed that in this Capan-2 spheroid model,
the actively proliferating cells are restricted to the outer
150 μm of the spheroid. The observed gradient is similar
to reported proliferation gradient on other cell types
spheroid models [2,22]. However the indicated limit
from the surface can vary upon the size of the spheroid,
the relative cell packing density and the cell type [2].
The decrease of the percentage of EdU positive cells
and the absence of proliferating cells at the center of the
spheroid are likely to reflect the fact that as function of
the distance to the spheroid surface (i.e. away from
nutrients, oxygen, ...) cells are increasingly prevented to
pass through the restriction point and to commit into
the cell cycle, resulting in a progressive increase in G1
duration and consequently in the enlargement of cell
cycle duration. This could be related to the persistence
of G1/Fucci-red expressing cells in inner regions where
there is no more S-G2/Fucci-green expressing cell.
Longer EdU incorporation (up to 48 h) resulted only in
a slight (10%) increase in the percentage of EdU positive
cells, thus indicating that only a very minor fraction of
(See figure on previous page.)

correspond to the mean+/−SEM of percentage of positive cells on 10–30 sections from 2 or 3 independent experiments with 5 to 10 different
spheroids each.

cells has an overall cell cycle duration from 24 to 48 h.
Additionally, these data also suggest that quiescence
associated with loss of Fucci-red positivity, according to
Xouri et al. [23], is probably progressively occurring in
cells located from 120 μm to the center of the spheroid.
This progressive G1 enlargement and entry into quies￾cence is probably associated with increase Cyclin￾dependent kinase inhibitors (CKI) expression as
suggested by LaRue et al. on different spheroid models
[2,22]. Unfortunately, none of the antibodies directed
against CKIs has given a satisfying signal in our experi￾mental conditions.
We reported three examples of treatment that result
in quite different behavior of the spheroids and illustrate
that major discrepancies could be observed between 2D
and 3D evaluation. The limited and regionalized effects
of lovastatin at tolerable concentration might reflect a
lovastatin penetration issue, as this has been reported
with other compounds [24] and is known as a limitation
of the model. Nevertheless, one might consider the
penetration in 3D MCTS as an essential parameter to
predict the ability of a candidate drug to penetrate in the
deepest domains of tumor microregions. Another pos￾sible explanation is that the concentration of lovastatin
needed to observe a massive cell cycle effect upon deple￾tion of mevalonate is higher than the concentration
leading to the deleterious effects associated with inhib￾ition of HMG-CoA reductase in 3D culture. Data
obtained with the activation of the DNA damage check￾point by etoposide provide an example of detectable
modification of cell cycle suggesting that Capan-2 Fucci
expressing spheroid models could be used to detect or
to investigate the effect of a novel DNA damaging com￾pound. EGF deprivation sensitivity of a Capan-2 spher￾oid and its effect on cell cycle distribution could not
have been predicted on a 2D culture as cells are no
dependent on this growth factor when grown as a
monolayer. Our results showed that growth arrest of
Capan-2 spheroids upon EGF removal relies on a cell
cycle progression slowdown in G1 but also G2. It has
been proposed that EGFR signaling might play a role in
the G2/M phase of the cell cycle in human tumor cell
overexpressing EGFR [25]. Our observations suggest
that, when grown in 3D, Capan-2 cells are prone to ar￾rest or slow down their cell cycle in G2 in response to
EGF deprivation.
Conclusion
One of the main lessons from this study is that one can￾not simplistically extrapolate cell cycle effects observed
in 2D culture to 3D models such as spheroids. Making
for instance the comparison of the etoposide effect in
both models would suggest that the observed result in
3D is quite moderate. However, our study warns us on
the fact that we should completely rethink the way we
interpreted and analyze the effect of a given drug on the
cell cycle. A tumor, or a tumor model such as a MCTS
is not a population of exponentially growing cells that
cycle from G1 to S, G2 and mitosis without any con￾straint. In spheroid, the major parameters that have to
be taken into consideration are regionalization and
above all heterogeneity of the cell cycle parameters and
distribution within the outermost layers constituting the
proliferating zone.
