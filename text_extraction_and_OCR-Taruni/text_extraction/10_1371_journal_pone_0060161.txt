Abstract
Diabetes is associated with a higher incidence of myocardial infarction (MI) and increased risk for adverse vascular and
fibrogenic events post-MI. Bone marrow-derived progenitor cell (BMPC) therapy has been shown to promote
neovascularization, decrease infarct area and attenuate left ventricular (LV) dysfunction after MI. Unlike vascular effects,
the anti-fibrosis mechanisms of BMPC, specifically under diabetic conditions, are poorly understood. We demonstrated that
intramyocardial delivery of BMPCs in infarcted diabetic db/db mice significantly down-regulates profibrotic miRNA-155 in
the myocardium and improves LV remodeling and function. Furthermore, inhibition of paracrine factor hepatocyte growth
factor (HGF) signaling in vivo suppressed the BMPC-mediated inhibition of miR-155 expression and the associated
protective effect on cardiac fibrosis and function. In vitro studies confirmed that the conditioned media of BMPC inhibited
miR-155 expression and profibrotic signaling in mouse cardiac fibroblasts under diabetic conditions. However, neutralizing
antibodies directed against HGF blocked these effects. Furthermore, miR-155 over-expression in mouse cardiac fibroblasts
inhibited antifibrotic Sloan-Kettering Institute proto-oncogene (Ski) and Ski-related novel gene, non-Alu-containing (SnoN)
signaling and abrogated antifibrogenic response of HGF. Together, our data demonstrates that paracrine regulation of
cardiac miRNAs by transplanted BMPCs contributes to the antifibrotic effects of BMPC therapy. BMPCs release HGF, which
inhibits miR-155-mediated profibrosis signaling, thereby preventing cardiac fibrosis. These data suggest that targeting miR￾155 might serve as a potential therapy against cardiac fibrosis in the diabetic heart.

Introduction
Experimental and clinical studies have shown the potential
benefits of bone marrow-derived progenitor cell (BMPC) therapy
for cardiovascular diseases [1,2,3]. Paracrine cytokines and growth
factors released from transplanted progenitor cells have been
shown to modulate cardiomyocyte survival, angiogenesis, mobili￾zation and activation of endogenous stem cells [4,5,6]. Despite
well-defined role of BMPC-mediated vasculogenesis, the molecu￾lar mechanisms involved in the antifibrosis effects of BMPC-based
therapy are poorly understood. MicroRNAs (miR, small noncod￾ing RNAs) are key regulators of gene expression and therefore,
influence the pathophysiology of cardiovascular diseases [7,8,9].
Several miRNAs in the myocardium are modulated after MI
including those that have been implicated in the regulation of
fibrosis like miR-21, miR-29, miR-30, miR-133 and miR-155
[8,9,10,11,12]. Therefore understanding mechanisms that could
regress MI-induced fibrosis in a relevant disease model of cardiac
fibrosis would serve as a springboard for developing strategies to
prevent cardiac dysfunction and improve post-infarct prognosis.
Diabetic patients have a 2- to 5-fold increased risk of developing
heart failure and higher incidence of ischemic heart disease
[13,14]. Interestingly, diabetes also negatively influences sub￾sequent cardiac remodeling events post-MI [15], therefore
accounting for increased mortality among diabetic patients.
Although the underlying mechanism is poorly understood, cardiac
fibrosis has been shown to be a major feature of diabetic heart
failure [16]. Hyperglycemia-induced fibrogenesis may negatively
affect cardiac structure and function playing a specific role in the
pathophysiology of heart failure in diabetes [17], therefore,
necessitating the development of new therapeutic targets to treat
LV dysfunction and remodeling in the diabetic heart.
In this study, we demonstrate that administration of BMPC in
diabetic (db/db) mice after MI regulates cardiac miRNAs. BMPC
administration reduced the expression of profibrotic miR-155 and
fibrosis response in the diabetic hearts. We further show that
neutralizing hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) signaling, both in vitro
and in vivo, inhibits miR-155 expression and Ski/SnoN signaling
leading to aggravated fibrogenesis response.

Materials and Methods
Bone Marrow Progenitor Cell (BMPC) Isolation and
Culture
Mouse BMPC isolation, ex vivo expansion and culture of BMPCs
was performed as previously described [3,18,19]. In brief, bone
marrow mononuclear cells collected from C57BLKS/J mice
(Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME) were fractionated by
density-gradient centrifugation with Histopaque-1083 (Sigma) and
seeded onto culture dishes coated with 5 mg/ml human fibronectin
(Sigma). Cells were maintained in endothelial cell basal medium-2
(EBM-2, Lonza, Walkersville, MD) supplemented with endothelial
cell growth supplement (EGM-2 MV, Lonza) and 5% fetal bovine
serum (FBS). Cells were cultured at 37uC with 5% CO2 in
a humidified chamber. After 4 days in culture, adherent cells were
washed with PBS and further cultured for 3 days in fresh growth
medium. These cells showed characteristics of spindle shaped
Endothelial Progenitor Cells (EPCs; data not shown) in accor￾dance with previously published methods [3,18,19].
Preparation of BMPC Conditioned Media (BMPC-CM) and
Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) for
Secreted HGF
To produce BMPC conditioned medium (BMPC-CM), 56106
cells were cultured for 48 hours in growth factor-free EBM-2 with
1% FBS. The conditioned medium was then collected, filtered
with a 0.22 mm filter (Pall Corp., Ann Arbor, MI) to harvest cell￾free solution and concentrated (10X) by centrifugation using
Ultrafree filter membranes (Millipore). EBM-2 containing 1% FBS
without supplements served as control medium. Release of HGF
into the media was measured by quantitative ELISA using HGF
immunoassay kit (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) as per
manufacturers instructions. At least three independent measure￾ments were performed in duplicates. HGF secretions from mouse
endothelial cell line SVECs cultured under similar conditions were
used for comparison. HGF levels are depicted in Figure S1
(supporting information).
Isolation and Culture of Adult Mouse Cardiac Fibroblasts
Cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) were isolated from hearts of 12-week￾old C57BLKS/J mice, as previously described [20,21]. Briefly, the
explanted hearts from mice were perfused with PBS-EDTA for 10
minutes, cut into pieces and digested with enzyme solution
containing collagenase type II, trypsin and a-chymotrypsin
(Worthington Biochem., Lakewood, NJ) at 37uC for 1 h, until
the tissue blocks disappeared. The supernatant was subjected to
Percoll density gradient centrifugation. After 1 h in culture, non￾adherent cells were removed and adherent cells were grown to
confluence (,3 days) in Dulbecco’s modified minimum essential
medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% newborn calf serum
and penicillin and streptomycin (1% v/v). CFs were then
trypsinized (TrypLETM Express, GibcoH) and replated on tissue

culture grade dishes in DMEM/M199 medium and maintained at
37uC in humid air with 5% CO2. Confluent cells were almost
exclusively fibroblasts (.98% purity), as previously reported
[20,21]. The cells were morphologically homogeneous with typical
bipolar configuration observed by inverse microscopy.
Assessment of miR-155 Expression and Fibrogenesis
To determine the effects of BMPC-CM on cardiac fibroblast
miR-155 expression and fibrosis signaling in vitro, we exposed
cardiac fibroblasts to diabetic milieu to activate fibrogenesis
signaling and evaluated the effect of conditioned medium derived
from cultured BMPC. To replicate the in vivo context (diabetic
milieu), cardiac fibroblasts were grown in serum-free normal
glucose (control) medium [5.5 mM glucose] for 24 h and exposed
to 25 mM glucose +10 ng/ml TGF-b1 (diabetic milieu) with
BMPC-CM or control medium. To correct for hyperosmolarity,
a separate set of cells were exposed to 5.5 mM glucose +19.5 mM
mannitol (OC, osmotic control). For assessing miR-155 expression
(24 hr after treatment), total RNA was isolated using miRNeasy kit
(Qiagen) and miRNA was analyzed by Taqman MicroRNA assay
kits (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA) in accordance with the
manufacturer’s protocol. miRNA levels were normalized with
RNU6B (U6 control) expression. To evaluate fibrogenic response,
expression of collagen type I alpha 1 (Col1A1), collagen type 3
alpha 1 (Col3A1) and alpha-smooth muscle actin (a-SMA) in
cardiac fibroblast after 48 hr of treatment was assessed by qRT￾PCR or Western blotting.
miR-155 Over-expression in Cardiac Fibroblasts (CF)
To enable detailed study of miR-155 effects on fibrosis-related
genes in cardiac fibroblasts, we transfected cardiac fibroblasts with
either pre-miR-155 (miR mimics) or negative control mimics.
Cardiac fibroblasts were grown in DMEM media without
antibiotics and transfected with either miRNA mimics or controls
(30 nM, Applied Biosystems) using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX
(Invitrogen) for 72 hrs as per the manufacturer instructions.
Transfected cells were ,95% viable (data not shown). miRNA was
assessed by qRT-PCR. Pre-miR-155 transfection significantly
increased miR-155 expression as compared to mimic control
transfected cells (P,0.01; Figure S2, supporting information).
siRNA-mediated Knockdown of HGF in BMPCs
After BMPCs were cultured for seven days, the cells were
transfected with small interfering RNA (siRNA) against mouse
HGF or scrambled siRNA (Qiagen). Using Lipofectamine
RNAiMAX (Invitrogen), the siRNA at a final concentration of
30 nM in Opti-MEM media (Invitrogen) was transfected into
BMPCs, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. After 48 hrs
of transfection, HGF secretion from these cells was confirmed by
ELISA. siRNA directed against HGF significantly suppressed
HGF secretion in vitro in comparison with control siRNA
transfected cells (P,0.01; Figure S3, supporting information).
Myocardial Infarction and Intramyocardial
Transplantation of BMPCs in Diabetic Mouse
All animal research in this study was conducted in accordance
with the protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee (IACUC) at Northwestern University (Chicago,
IL). Ten-weeks-old male C57BLKS/J db/db (diabetic) mice and
their normal littermate controls (db/+ mice) were purchased from
The Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME). Baseline blood
glucose levels (blood obtained by tail snip) were measured using
One Touch Ultra2 blood glucometer (Lifescan Inc., Milpitas, CA).
db/db mice exhibited marked hyperglycaemia compared with
relative db/+ controls (non-fasting average blood glucose level
387.2624.4 vs. 140.8610.4 mg/dL, p,0.01). Mice were sub￾jected to myocardial infarction (MI) by permanent ligation of left
anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) as described previously
[3]. Immediately after LAD ligation, 16106 BMPCs in a total
volume of 15 mL was injected intramyocardially into 3 different
sites in the periinfarct area distal to the ligation of the artery.
Control animals received a corresponding volume of normal
saline.
In vivo Neutralization of HGF by an Anti-HGF Antibody or
Administration of Recombinant Mouse HGF Protein
To determine if the antifibrosis effect of BMPC treated mice is
inhibited by blocking HGF signaling, a subset of mice that
underwent MI surgery and BMPC transplantation were injected
intraperitoneally with neutralizing goat anti-HGF antibodies
(25 mg/kg b.w. per day for seven days; R&D Systems, Minnea￾polis, MN) or normal goat IgG for 7 days, post-MI. Antibody dose
is based on previous published data [22,23]. Mouse recombinant
HGF protein (PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NJ ) 10 mg in PBS was
injected intramyocardially into 3 regions in the border zone distal
to the ligation of the coronary artery immediately after induction
of the MI followed by intraperitoneal injection (500 ng/mouse/
day for five days). Control animals received a corresponding
volume of PBS.
Echocardiography Analysis
Transthoracic two-dimensional M-mode echocardiogram was
obtained using Vevo 770 (VisualSonics, Toronto, Canada)
equipped with a 30 MHz transducer. Echocardiographic studies
were performed before (baseline) and at 7 and 28 days post-MI on
mice anesthetized with a mixture of 1.5% isoflurane and oxygen (1
L/min). M-mode tracings were used to measure end-systolic
diameter (LVESD) and end-diastolic diameter (LVEDD) and

marginally (although not significantly) decreased MI-induced miR-155
expression (measured by qRT-PCR) in comparison with saline-treated
group. Administration of neutralizing antibodies against HGF (HGF-Ab)
significantly elevated miR-155 levels as compared to IgG treated group.

percent ejection fraction (%EF) was calculated as described
previously [3,19].
Cardiac Fibrosis Assessment
Histopathology studies were performed as described previously
[3,19]. The hearts were fixed with 10% buffered formalin and
paraffin embedded. Cardiac fibrosis was quantified on Picrosirius
red (Polyscience, Inc., Warrington, PA, USA)-stained sections.
Fibrosis area (red) and total LV area was measured using NIH’s
ImageJ software to determine percent fibrosis.
Quantitative Reverse Transcription PCR (qRT-PCR)
qRT-PCR was performed as described previously [3,19]. RNA
was extracted from cells using RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen).
Following cDNA synthesis, amplification was performed using
Taqman 7300 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Relative
mRNA expression of target genes was normalized to the
endogenous 18 s control or GAPDH gene.
Protein Isolation and Western Blot Analysis
Protein isolation and Western blotting for cultured cells were
performed as previously described [3,19]. Briefly, cells were
homogenized in lysis buffer (Cell Signaling Technology, MA,
USA) containing 20 mmol/L Tris-HCl [pH 7.5], 150 mmol/L
NaCl, 2.5 mmol/L sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mmol/L b-glycer￾ophosphate, 1 mmol/L sodium orthovanadate, 1 mg/ml leupep￾tin, 1 mmol/L ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid [EDTA], 1 mmol/
L ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid [EGTA], 1% Triton X-100 and
protease inhibitors. Equal amounts of protein were separated by
10% SDS-PAGE and blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride
(PVDF) membranes (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). The blots were
incubated with antibodies against SnoN (Santa Cruz, USA), Ski
(Santa Cruz, USA), collagen I (Southernbiotech), a-SMA (Abcam),
beta-actin (Cell signaling) and developed with an enhanced
chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham, Piscataway, NJ).
Statistical Analysis
All data are expressed as mean 6 SEM. Differences between
groups were assessed by an unpaired Student’s t-test for single
comparisons or by ANOVA for multiple comparisons, with
Bonferroni post-hoc test. Values of P,0.05 were considered
statistically significant.

fibrosis [9,10,11,24,25]). Figure 1 depicts that saline-treated MI
mice showed a significant increase in expression of miR-21 and
miR-155 (P,0.01; Figures 1A and 1B) and decrease in miR-29
and miR-133a (P,0.01; Figures 1C and 1D) levels with non￾significant reducing trend of miR-27 and miR-30a (Figures
S4.A,B, supporting information). Interestingly, BMPC treatment
inhibited MI-induced up-regulation of miR-21 (P,0.05;
Figure 1A; shown to inhibit fibrosis by targeting sprouty
homologue-1 [8] and phosphatase and tensin homologue [25])
and miR-155 (P,0.05; Figure 1B), which has been shown to play
a role in cancer, atherosclerosis and immunomodulation
[26,27,28,29,30]. Furthermore, BMPC administration upregu￾lated miR-29 expression (P,0.05; Figure 1C), which is known to
inhibit fibrosis by targeting collagen and fibrillin-1 [9] and
increased miR-133a (P,0.05; Figure 1D), a negative regulator
of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) [10]. In contrast, the
expression of miR-27 and 30a was not affected by BMPC therapy
(Figure S4.A&B, supporting information). Together, these data
indicate that BMPC administration modulates the expression of
several fibrosis-related miRNAs after myocardial infarction.
The role of miRNAs 221, 229, 2133a in fibrosis has been
previously described [9,10,11,24,25]. However, miR-155 was
most efficiently suppressed by BMPC treatment and its role in
fibrosis is not known and has been shown to play an important
role in acute viral myocarditis, cancer, inflammation and
immunomodulation [26,27,28,29,30]. Recent study has shown
that increased circulating miR-155 was predictive for cardiac
death in post-AMI patients. [31]. Therefore, we further

elucidated the significance of this miRNA in BMPC-mediated
inhibition of fibrosis. We have previously shown that BMPC
therapy reduced MI-induced cardiac fibrosis [3]. However, to
evaluate its role in diabetes, we have tested the effect of BMPC
on cardiac fibrosis in diabetic mice.
BMPC Conditioned Media (BMPC-CM) Inhibits miR-155
Expression in Mouse Cardiac Fibroblasts (CFs) and
Fibrogenesis Signaling in a Diabetic milieu, in vitro
Cardiac fibrosis significantly contributes to diabetes-induced
diastolic dysfunction [9,32,33] and TGF-b activation plays
a critical role in the process [34,35,36]. To determine whether
BMPC may inhibit miR-155 expression in a paracrine manner, we
evaluated the effect of conditioned medium derived from cultured
BMPC on cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) exposed to diabetic milieu (to
activate fibrogenesis signaling). Cardiac fibroblasts were grown in
serum-free normal glucose (control) medium [5.5 mM glucose] for
24 h and exposed to 25 mM glucose +10 ng/ml TGF-b1 (diabetic
conditions) with control or BMPC-CM. As shown in Figure 2A,
diabetic conditions markedly increased the expression of miR-155
after 24 hours (P,0.01). In contrast, addition of BMPC
conditioned media significantly suppressed the diabetic condition
induced up-regulation of miR-155 (P,0.05). In association with
increased miR-155, diabetic conditions significantly increased the
mRNA expression of fibrotic markers, including Col1A1, Col3A1
and a-SMA after a 24 hour stimulation (Figures 2B, 2C and 2D;
P,0.05) and protein expression of collagen I and a-SMA
(Figure 2E) in CFs.
Among several paracrine factors secreted, the release of VEGF,
SDF-1, IGF-1, and HGF was profoundly increased in EPC cell
culture supernatants [4,5]. HGF has been shown to play an
important role in the pathogenesis of fibrotic cardiovascular
disease [37,38] and myocardial protection against ischemia/
reperfusion injury [39]. To identify the factor that mediate the
protective effect of BMPC conditioned media, the antifibrotic
cytokine hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), a paracrine factor of
BMPC [5,24,40] was blocked by neutralizing antibodies. The
effect of BMPC conditioned media on miR-155 expression was
significantly reversed by a neutralizing antibody directed against
HGF (P,0.05 vs IgG treated cells; Figures 2A). Furthermore,
BMPC-CM significantly inhibited fibrotic response induced by
diabetic conditions (Figures 2B, 2C, 2D; P,0.05 and Figure 2E).
However, neutralizing antibodies against HGF significantly re￾versed the effects of HGF (Figures 2). These data suggest that
HGF, which is secreted by BMPC, inhibits diabetic condition￾induced miR-155 expression and blocks fibrogenesis activity of
cardiac fibroblasts in vitro.
HGF Inhibition Abrogates the Antifibrosis Effect of BMPC
after Myocardial Infarction in Diabetic db/db Mice
Given the strong correlation between diabetes and cardiac
fibrosis [13,14,15,16], we explored whether BMPC therapy (via
HGF secretion) inhibits miR-155 expression and prevents cardiac
fibrosis in the infarcted hearts of diabetic mice. We transplanted
BMPCs intramyocardially after MI followed by systemic admin￾istration of anti-HGF antibodies to neutralize secreted HGF in vivo
in db/db mice. As compared to saline treated mice, BMPC
transplantation reduced miR-155 expression (albeit not significant,
Figure 3) in the myocardium at 3 days after MI and showed
decrease in cardiac fibrosis (Figure 4; P,0.05 vs saline-treated
mice) and improved LV function (increased %EF; Figure 5;
P,0.05 vs saline treated mice) at 28 days after MI. Similarly,
mRNA expression of ECM proteins, such as collagen (Col1A1,
Col3A1) and a-SMA was increased in correlation with fibrotic
response (Figure 6). Interestingly, HGF inhibition using anti-HGF
antibodies in BMPC treated mice showed pronounced elevation of
miR-155 expression (Figure 3, P,0.05 vs IgG-treated mice) in
association with increased myocardial fibrosis (Figure 4; P,0.05),
depressed cardiac function (reduced %EF; Figure 5; P,0.05) and
increased mRNA expression of fibrotic markers (Figure 6) as
compared to IgG treated mice. Together, these data demonstrate
that BMPC-derived HGF regulates cardiac miR-155 and there￾fore modulates fibrosis in the infarcted heart.
Additionally, in a subset of mice, administration of recombinant
HGF decreased miR-155 expression and reduced fibrosis and
improved LV function (Figure S5, P,0.05 vs saline-treated mice).
Furthermore, to elucidate the role of BMPC-derived HGF in
regulating cardiac fibrosis, we inhibited HGF in mouse BMPC
using siRNA and transplanted intramyocardially after MI in db/db
mice. As compared to control siRNA BMPC treated hearts,
inhibition of HGF in transplanted BMPC (siRNA-HGF) signifi￾cantly increased miR-155 expression in the myocardium (Figure

fibrosis (Figure S6.B) and function (Figure S6.C), demonstrating
that inhibition of HGF signaling reverses the effect of BMPC
therapy on miR-155 expression and cardiac fibrosis and function
in diabetic mice.
miR-155 Over-expression Inhibits HGF-mediated Anti￾fibrosis Effect in Mouse Cardiac Fibroblast, in vitro
To evaluate the effect of miR-155 on fibrosis signaling, we over￾expressed miR-155 in mouse cardiac fibroblasts using miR-155
mimic (pre-miR-155) and determined the effect on HGF-mediated
anti-fibrosis signaling. As shown in Figure 7, miR-155 over￾expression did not affect TGF b1, TGF-b receptor 1 (TGF-bR1)
and TGF-b receptor 2 (TGF-bR2) (Figure 7A,B,C). We further
evaluated miR-155 effect on inhibitors of TGF-b signaling like
Sloan-Kettering Institute proto-oncogene (Ski) and Ski-related
novel gene, non-Alu-containing (SnoN). Previous studies have
shown that Ski/SnoN are expressed in all tissues at low levels and
HGF up-regulates Ski/SnoN and therefore inhibits fibrosis
response [41]. The Ski proto-oncoprotein has been shown to co￾repress TGF-b1 post-receptor signaling through receptor-activated
Smads (R-Smads) [41] and Ski inhibits fibrosis through regulation
of cardiac myofibroblast phenotype [42]. Interestingly, miR-155
over-expression significantly decreased mRNA expression of Ski/
SnoN (Figure 7D and 7E; P,0.05) and protein levels (Figure 7F)
as compared to control cells. Next, we determined whether miR￾155 over-expression affects HGF-mediated antifibrogenic response

in cardiac fibroblasts under diabetic milieu (to stimulate fibrogenesis
response). Interestingly, miR-155 over-expression abrogated
HGF-mediated decrease in fibrosis-related markers like Col1A1,
Col3A1 and a-SMA (Figure 8; P,0.01), suggesting that anti￾fibrotic effect of HGF/miR-155 might be working predominantly
through suppression of negative feedback inhibitor of TGF￾b signaling.
Discussion
Cardiac fibrosis is a pathological hallmark of diabetic complica￾tions. In the present study we demonstrate that bone marrow￾derived progenitor cell (BMPC) administration regulates expres￾sion of miRs (specifically miR-155) and modulates fibrosis in the
infarcted heart in diabetic (db/db) mice. Furthermore, neutraliza￾tion of paracrine factor, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)
aggravates fibrogenic response both in vivo and in vitro (possible
mechanism is depicted in Figure 9). Experimental and clinical
studies have shown potential benefits of bone marrow-derived cell
therapy for cardiovascular diseases [1,2,6]. Among other mechan￾isms, paracrine cytokines and growth factors released from
transplanted progenitor cells have been shown to modulate
cardiomyocyte survival, angiogenesis, mobilization and activation
of endogenous stem cells, resulting in the reduction of infarct size
and improvement of the left ventricle function [4,5,24,40,43].
Although it is well accepted that BMPC mediates tissue repair
through angiogenesis/vasculogensis, little is known about the
molecular mechanisms underlying the anti-fibrotic response upon
BMPC transplantation in the myocardium.
HGF (also known as ‘‘scatter factor’’) is a multifunctional
molecule that elicits a wide spectrum of biological activities in
many patho-physiological processes [39,44,45]. In the heart, HGF
has been shown to exert anti-apoptotic/cardioprotective effects in
rats subjected to MI [39,44] and promotes cardiac regeneration
through its antioxidant effects [44]. Also, HGF is a potent
angiogenic factor that mobilizes EPCs [45] and protects human
endothelial cells against advanced glycation end product-induced
apoptosis [46]. Despite the clear indications for HGF to effectively
treat post-ischemic heart failure, knowledge on the mechanism of
HGF signaling in fibrosis is still limited. In particular, nothing is
known about the role of the HGF signaling in BMPC-based
therapy for cardiac regeneration in diabetic hearts.
HGF has been shown to inhibit TGF-b mediated fibrosis
signaling in a variety of disease models including renal and
cardiovascular systems [37,44], and specifically under diabetic
conditions [46]. Our findings in the present study that inhibition of
HGF secretion (HGF siRNA transfected BMPC) or neutralization
of secreted HGF using antibodies against HGF in vivo abrogates

were either transfected with miR-155 mimics (pre-miR-155) to over-express miR-155 or with negative control mimics (control), treated with or without
HGF under diabetic conditions [TGF-b (10 ug/mL+high glucose (25 mM glucose)] and mRNA expression of fibrogenesis markers like col1A1 (A),
col3A1 (B) and a-SMA (C) were measured by qRT-PCR. HGF decreased the expression of above markers. *P,0.01 versus without HGF. Over￾expression of miR-155 nullified the effects of HGF. P,0.01 versus control-transfected cells. HGF indicates hepatocyte growth factor; Col1A1, collagen

the antifibrosis effect of BMPC therapy, suggesting that BMPC
release of paracrine factor (HGF) suppresses profibrogenic
signaling in diabetic hearts. In addition, we studied the effect of
recombinant HGF protein administration on cardiac fibrotic
response to account for any loss or marginalization of effect in
BMPC transfected with HGF siRNA. Together, these data
correlate with the previous study that demonstrated that in vivo
gene transfer of HGF before ischemia showed multiple beneficial
actions (specifically antioxidant effect), therefore contributing to
the reduction in the infarct size and the improvement of left
ventricular dysfunction after infarction [44]. Furthermore, super￾natants of BMPC inhibit fibrogenesis response in cardiac
fibroblasts, which was inhibited upon neutralization of HGF using
antibodies against HGF. These data suggest that the antifibrosis
effect of BMPC might be mediated through paracrine secretion of
HGF. It should be noted that several other cytokines are known to
influence cardiac function and may play important roles,
particularly in pathologic situations such as acute myocardial
infarction [4,5]. Although, cytokines other than HGF were not
examined in the present study, it is possible that HGF modulates
the ischemia-reperfusion injury and post-infarct process through
interaction with other cytokines. However, the mechanism of
HGF-mediated antifibrosis effect, specifically in diabetes is poorly
understood.
Diabetes is an important risk factor for coronary heart disease
and contributes to the development of cardiovascular diseases. An
increase in TGF-b production is commonly thought to contribute
to excessive cardiac fibrosis in patients with diabetes [34].
Fibroblasts are responsible for the synthesis of Extra Cellular
Matrix (ECM) components, both in the healthy heart, as well as in
pathological fibrosis [34]. However, understanding signaling
cascades that control ECM synthesis and degradation, and
fibroblast proliferation and apoptosis are crucial in evolving stem
cell-based strategies to inhibit cardiac fibrosis. We have previously
shown that BMPC therapy reduced MI-induced cardiac fibrosis
[3,19]. Given that microRNAs (miRNAs) modulate pathophysi￾ology of cardiovascular diseases through regulation of gene
expression [7,8,9,47], we determined whether BMPCs adminis￾tration after MI regulates miRNAs (like miR-21, miR-27, miR-29,
miR-155, miR-30a and miR-133a) that have been shown to play
a role in fibrosis in various tissues/organs [8,11,12]. Saline-treated
(control) MI mice showed a significant up-regulation of miR-21
and miR-155 and decrease in miR-29 and miR-133a expression
(Figure 1). These results are consistent with the previous findings
[8,9,25,27], however it should be noted that several other miRNAs
(related or unrelated to fibrosis) might have been modulated as
reported by earlier investigators [7,11]. Interestingly, BMPC
administration modulates the expression of several fibrosis-related
miRNAs after MI, specifically up-regulated miR-29 and miR-133a
and down-regulated miR-155 and miR-21. However, the role of
miRNAs 221, 229, 2133a in cardiac fibrosis has been previously
described [9,10,25]. For instance, miR-29 has been shown to
inhibit fibrosis by targeting collagen and fibrillin-1 [9], miR-133a
negatively regulates connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) [10]
and miR-21 targets sprouty homologue 1 [8] and phosphatase and
tensin homologue [25]]. Although the role miR-27 and miR-30a
in fibrosis has been established in other organs systems [12,48],
their levels remained unchanged in the present study.
Interestingly, miR-155 was most efficiently suppressed by
BMPC treatment in the present study. Several studies have
reported that miR-155 expression is modulated in a number of
physiological and pathological processes such as hematopoiesis,
immunity, tumorigenesis [26,27,28,29] and inflammation [49].
Recent study has shown that a subset of circulating miRNAs
(specifically, increased serum miR-155 and miR-380) are pre￾dictive for cardiac death in human patients after hospital discharge
for acute myocardial infarction [31]. In a mouse model of lung
fibrosis, miR-155 has been shown to be increased in response to
several inflammatory mediators in different cell types [50]. High
levels of miR-155 were detected in synovial fibroblasts from
rheumatoid arthritis patients, an autoimmune disorder associated
with high inflammation [51]. TGF-b-treated murine mammary
gland (NMuMG) epithelial cells showed significantly elevated
miRNA-155 levels and knockdown of miR-155 suppressed TGF￾b-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) [28]. Fur￾thermore, inhibition of miR-155 attenuated cardiac inflammatory
response and myocardial damage in acute viral myocarditis in
mice [27]. Given that diabetes is associated with chronic
inflammatory response; and that miR-155 plays an important
role in cancer, inflammation and immunomodulation
[26,27,28,29] and limited literature is available regarding its role
in cardiac fibrosis especially in the setting of diabetes and BMPC
therapy, we further elucidated the significance of this miRNA in
BMPC-mediated inhibition of fibrosis. Therefore, we next
explored how HGF inhibited fibrosis after myocardial ischemia
under diabetic conditions. Along with the progression of fibrosis,
the expression of miR-155 was significantly elevated after MI in
the hearts of db/db mice that received BMPC transfected with
siRNA against HGF, as compared to control siRNA BMPC
treated hearts. Similarly, mRNA expression of ECM proteins,
such as collagen I, collagen III and a-SMA, was also significantly
increased in correlation with fibrotic response (Figure 4b).
Furthermore, inhibition of HGF signaling in vivo by systemically
applying antibodies against HGF significantly elevated miR-155
expression and aggravated cardiac fibrosis as compared to BMPC￾treated mice (Figure 6). Together, these data demonstrate that
BMPC-derived HGF regulates cardiac miR-155 and therefore
fibrosis in the infarcted heart. However, functions of miR-155 in
cardiac fibroblasts and its role in fibrogenesis response have not yet
been documented.
To explore the potential intracellular molecular mechanism by
which miR-155 promotes fibrosis response in diabetes, we
examined the effect of miR-155 over-expression in cardiac
fibroblasts on TGF-b, TGF-b receptors -I & -II and co-repressor
of TGF-b signaling like Ski/SnoN. Over-expression of miR-155 in
cardiac fibroblasts only marginally affected the mRNA expression
of TGF-b1 and its type I and type II receptors. However, miR-155
over-expression inhibited expression of Ski and SnoN at both
mRNA and protein levels in cardiac fibroblast cells. Previous
reports have shown that Ski/SnoN physically interacted with
activated Smad-2 by forming transcriptionally inactive complex
and overrode the profibrotic action of TGF-b1 [41]. Cellular
transdifferentiation through Endothelial to mesenchymal transi￾tion (EndoMT) induced by TGF-b1 has emerged as a possible
source of tissue myofibroblasts and cardiac fibrosis and HGF has
been shown to inhibit EndoMT in the heart [38]. Previous reports
have demonstrated that HGF blocks TGF-b1 signaling via up￾regulating Smad transcriptional co-repressor SnoN expression
[52]. It is not clear whether BMPC therapy specifically affects
EndMT process in the present study. However, the findings in the
present study illustrate the potential of confining Smad activity
using anti-miR-155 as an effective strategy for blocking cardiac
fibrosis. Also, Ski has been shown to be a direct target of miR-155
in melanoma cell lines [29]. Furthermore, computational analysis
(using TargetScan database) shows that Ski lodges a complimen￾tary sequence for miR-155. In the present study, miR-155 over￾expression in cardiac fibroblasts significantly suppressed HGF￾induced Ski expression, suggesting that Ski/SnoN might be a direct

target of miR-155 and therefore exhibits profibrotic response
through suppression of Ski/SnoN signaling.
Together, our data demonstrates that the paracrine regulation
of cardiac miRNAs by transplanted BMPCs contributes to the
antifibrotic effects of cell therapy. In particular, BMPCs release
HGF, which inhibits the miR-155-mediated profibrosis response
leading to inhibition of cardiac fibrosis and improvements in
cardiac function. Based on these data and available literature, we
anticipate that targeting miR-155 might serve as a potential
therapy against cardiac fibrosis in diabetic heart.
