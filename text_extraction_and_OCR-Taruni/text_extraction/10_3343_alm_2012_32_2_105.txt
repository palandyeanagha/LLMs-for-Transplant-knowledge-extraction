Osteoporosis is a major health problem worldwide, and is projected to increase exponen￾tially due to the aging of the population. The absolute fracture risk in individual subjects is
calculated by the use of algorithms which include bone mineral density (BMD), age, gen￾der, history of prior fracture and other risk factors. This review describes the laboratory in￾vestigations into osteoporosis which include serum calcium, phosphate, creatinine, alka￾line phosphatase and 25-hydroxyvitamin D and, additionally in men, testosterone. Para￾thyroid hormone (PTH) is measured in patients with abnormal serum calcium to deter￾mine its cause. Other laboratory investigations such as thyroid function testing, screening
for multiple myeloma, and screening for Cushing’s syndrome, are performed if indicated.
Measurement of bone turnover markers (BTMs) is currently not included in algorithms for
fracture risk calculations due to the lack of data. However, BTMs may be useful for moni￾toring osteoporosis treatment. Further studies of the reference BTMs serum carboxy ter￾minal telopeptide of collagen type I (s-CTX) and serum procollagen type I N-terminal pro￾peptide (s-PINP) in fracture risk prediction and in monitoring various treatments for osteo￾porosis may help expedite their inclusion in routine clinical practice.

INTRODUCTION
Osteoporosis is defined as “a disease characterised by low bone
mass and microarchitectural deterioration of bone tissue, lead￾ing to enhanced bone fragility and consequent increase in frac￾ture risk” [1]. The WHO’s diagnostic criterion for osteoporosis is
a bone mineral density (BMD) measurement equal to or more
than 2.5 SD below the young female (age 20-29 yr) reference
mean (T-score ≤-2.5 SD) [2]. Borderline decrease in BMD (T
score between -1.0 and -2.5) is designated as osteopenia. Os￾teoporosis is a silent disease and the health and economic im￾pact of the disease result from fracture, for which subjects with
osteoporosis are at an increased risk. Fracture of the femoral
neck in the elderly has the most serious consequences. For ex￾ample, in Korea, hip fractures cause major morbidity and mor￾tality, with long term loss of mobility in half of such patients, 25%
of patients requiring long term care and 11-17% of patients dy￾ing within a year [3-6]. The direct costs of medical care of hip
fractures were over $65 million in 2004 [3].
The impact of osteoporosis is projected to increase exponen￾tially due to the aging of the population. For example, in Korea,
7.2% of the population was aged >65 yr in 2000, but this is ex￾pected to double to 15.7% by 2020 [7]. The worldwide incidence
of osteoporotic fractures in 2000 was estimated at nine million,
with hip fractures contributing 1.6 million [8]. By 2050, the num￾ber of hip fractures worldwide is projected to increase to 6.3 mil￾ISSN 2234-3806 • eISSN 2234-3814

lion if fracture rates remain constant [9]. However, age-specific
fracture rates seem to have reached a plateau or may even be
decreasing in some parts of North America, Europe and Austra￾lia, while they seem to continue to increase in Asia where cur￾rent fracture rates are lower than in western countries and con￾tribute about 30% of hip fractures worldwide [8]. Asia is projected
to contribute 50% of hip fractures worldwide by 2050 [9]. In Ko￾rea, the number of hip fractures in women over 50 yr of age was
250.9/100,000 persons in 2001 and increased by nearly 5% in 3
yr to 262.8/100,000 in 2004 although in men the rate decreased
by over 15% from 162.8/100,000 in 2001 to 137.5/100,000 in 2004
[3].
Although BMD is used in the diagnosis of osteoporosis, a low
BMD is not the only risk factor for fractures, but is in fact an in￾efficient tool by itself for identifying those at high risk of fractures.
For example, at a population level, more fractures occur in those
with osteopenia than in those with osteoporosis simply because
there are a much larger number of people with osteopenia than
with osteoporosis. Therefore, in selecting patients for treatment,
the risk of fracture in individual subjects is now calculated by
the use of algorithms which include a number of recognized in￾dependent risk factors for fracture in addition to BMD, such as
age, sex, body mass index, family history, past history of fracture,
secondary causes of osteoporosis such as rheumatoid arthritis,
use of medications such as glucocorticoids, smoking and exces￾sive alcohol intake [10]. FRAX® (WHO Fracture risk assessment
tool) is such a fracture risk calculator that is freely accessible on
the web (www.shef.ac.uk/FRAX/). Since fracture risk varies by
ethnicity and/or country of residence, epidemiological data from
various countries have been used to provide country-specific
fracture risk. Where country-specific data are unavailable, sur￾rogate data may be used. For example, a recent study has sug￾gested that the fracture risk calculation based on Japanese data
in the FRAX® calculator might be the most appropriate for Ko￾rean women [11].
Although bone turnover predicts fracture independently of
BMD, bone turnover markers (BTMs) are not included in the
fracture risk calculator (FRAX®) for the following reasons. Sev￾eral studies have looked at various BTMs and their contribution
to fracture risk, but the results of these studies have been incon￾sistent, not the least due to the use of different markers and dif￾ferent methodologies for their assessment [12-20]. This has led
to the recommendation for the standardization of BTM measure￾ments in future studies with the use of serum carboxy terminal
telopeptide of collagen type I (s-CTX) as the standard bone re￾sorption marker and serum procollagen type I N-terminal pro￾peptide (s-PINP) as the standard bone formation marker [21].
Most of the positive results with BTMs were for bone resorption
markers, with increased resorption marker predicting an increased
fracture risk [12-20]. Whilst BTMs predict fracture risk indepen￾dently of BMD, their relationships to other established risk fac￾tors included in the risk calculator need to be clarified. For ex￾ample, prior fracture is a risk factor for future fractures, and is
included in the risk calculator. Fracture leads to an increase in
BTMs which is evident even 6 months after the event [22]; bone
formation markers may remain raised even at 52 weeks [23],
while resorption markers generally return baseline by then [24].
Some of the secondary causes of osteoporosis included in the
risk calculator, such as glucocorticoid use and rheumatoid ar￾thritis, can also lead to changes in BTMs. Glucocorticoid treat￾ment leads to a decrease in the bone formation marker osteo￾calcin and an increase in bone resorption markers [24]. In un￾treated rheumatoid arthritis, bone resorption markers increase,
with patients with active disease having higher levels than pa￾tients with non-active disease [25]. Other conditions associated
with osteoporosis such as primary hyperparathyroidism and thy￾rotoxicosis, are also associated with increased bone turnover.
Therefore, the extent to which BTMs predict fracture risk inde￾pendently of those risk factors needs to be defined before BTMs
can be included appropriately in fracture risk calculators.
LABORATORY INVESTIGATIONS IN 
OSTEOPOROSIS
Laboratory investigations in patients with osteoporosis are un￾dertaken to rule out or to detect common causes of osteoporosis
in order to treat them. Further targeted investigations may be
performed if indicated by clinical presentation, or if the first line
investigations are normal but the severity of osteoporosis is un￾usual for the age and gender. The following first-line measure￾ments may be routinely indicated in the investigation of patients
with osteoporosis [26]: Serum total calcium, albumin (to calcu￾late albumin adjusted calcium) and phosphate to detect condi￾tions associated with hypercalcemia such as primary hyperpara￾thyroidism or hypocalcemia and consequent secondary hyper￾parathyroidism causing bone loss; although albumin adjustment
for serum calcium is not universally performed, this practice
may be useful to correct total calcium measurements skewed by
abnormal albumin levels. Alternatively, ionized calcium mea￾surement gives a more accurate measure of calcium homeosta￾sis. Serum creatinine and estimated glomerular filtration rate
(GFR) are useful to detect renal failure which can affect bone

health. Serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) measurement is use￾ful to detect conditions including Paget’s disease, metastatic
bone disease and osteomalacia, etc. Total ALP is adequate for
demonstrating gross increases in bone formation such as those
found in most patients with active Paget’s disease, osteomala￾cia, fracture healing or metastatic bone disease, but is not sensi￾tive enough to detect changes in bone remodeling seen in most
cases of uncomplicated osteoporosis. Although gamma-glutamyl
transpeptidase (GGT) is suggested by some to distinguish an in￾crease in liver ALP from bone ALP, this is neither sensitive nor
specific for this purpose. If changes in bone formation need to
be determined with sensitivity, or distinguished from an increase
in total ALP due to liver disease, a specific bone formation
marker such as PINP could be measured.
Vitamin D nutrition should be determined by measuring serum
25-hydroxy vitamin D [25(OH)D]. Although there is controversy
about the optimum level of 25(OH)D for bone health; while 50
nmol/L is considered acceptable, others have suggested 75 nmol/
L as desirable for optimum bone health [27, 28]. If the higher cut￾off is used, then the vast majority of menopausal women (76.8%)
would be considered to have sub-optimal vitamin D nutrition [28].
A reference interval study performed in one of the authors’ labo￾ratory in Seoul showed that the central 95th percentile of 25(OH)
D levels in a healthy population above 40 yr of age was 25-70
nmol/L (unpublished data, Lee JH). Others have found that 22%
of postmenopausal Korean women have a 25(OH)D level <50
nmol/L [29]. 25(OH)D levels decrease in winter due to a reduc￾tion in sun exposure; Park et al. have reported that the mean se￾rum 25(OH)D of Korean postmenopausal women during winter￾time was 30.5 nmol/L [30], and So et al. found that the prevalence
of serum 25(OH)D <50 nmol/L, during wintertime was 90.1% [31].
Therefore we suggest that 50 nmol/L, recommended by the US
Institute of Medicine [27], is a more realistic and attainable goal
than a higher level for serum 25(OH)D. Current automated as￾says for 25(OH)D have been associated with analytical problems
including method related bias. Therefore properly standardized
liquid chromatography (LC)/mass spectrometry (MS) is the desir￾able method for measuring 25(OH)D [32].
PTH measurement would be required if serum calcium is ab￾normal, to help investigate the cause of the calcium abnormality
(Table 1). Appropriate sample handling is important for PTH mea￾surement [33]. A full examination of blood and erythrocyte sedi￾mentation rate (ESR) would be useful for general health and for
inflammatory diseases which often increase bone loss. Serum
protein electrophoresis and free light chains in older patients
would be useful to exclude multiple myeloma which causes ma￾jor bone loss. Other secondary causes such as thyrotoxicosis can
be excluded with thyroid function tests, and in men hypogonad￾ism is screened with a serum testosterone. In women, the diag￾nosis of menopause is made clinically and does not warrant es￾tradiol measurement. If Cushing’s syndrome is suggested clini￾cally, then screening tests could be performed: 24 hr urine corti￾sol, midnight salivary cortisol or overnight dexamethasone sup￾pression test. Rarer conditions, if suspected, could be specifically
tested; e.g. celiac disease (which is commonly seen in people of
European ancestry, but also in parts of Africa, the Middle East
and South Asia) with tissue transglutaminase antibody (together
with IgA) or systemic mastocytosis with serum tryptase and/or
urine methyl histamine. BTMs are not routinely recommended
for the assessment of osteoporosis for the reasons stated above.
However, if treatment for osteoporosis is to be initiated and moni￾toring with BTMs is intended, baseline measurement of fasting
morning s-CTX and/or s-PINP may be undertaken.
1. Measurement of BTMs
1) s-CTX
The reference bone resorption marker is s-CTX. The antibody
used in immunoassays for CTX in serum is raised against the
β-isomerized octapeptide (EKAH(β)DGGR) on the non-helical
carboxy terminal telopeptide of the type I collagen molecule [34];
Currently, two automated immunoassays are available: Beta￾CrossLaps Roche Elecsys (ECLIA, Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim,
Germany) and CTX-1 (CrossLaps) IDS-iSYS (CLIA, Immunodiag￾nostic Systems, Tyne and Wear, UK). While both immunoassays
use antibodies raised against the same epitope, there seems to
be some bias despite good correlation between the results pro￾duced by the two assays (personal communication, UK NEQAS
for Immunology, Immunochemistry & Allergy). An ELISA for s￾CTX is also available (Immunodiagnostic Systems, Tyne and
Wear, UK). S-CTX is influenced by renal function; it also shows
significant diurnal variability with a peak in the early morning
and a nadir in the afternoon, and food intake leads to a decrease

in level [34]. Therefore, sample collection needs to be standard￾ized, and performed in a fasting state in the morning. Whilst se￾rum or plasma can be used, the best stability is obtained in EDTA
plasma.
2) s-PINP
There are two forms of PINP in blood: the “intact” or trimeric
molecule and the monomer [34]. Assays which are currently
available measure either the trimeric form (intact assay) only or
both forms (total PINP). The total PINP assay (automated) is
available on Elecsys (Roche Diagnostics). The intact PINP assay
automated is available on IDS-iSYS (Immunodiagnostic Sys￾tems); a radioimmunoassay for intact PINP is also available
(UniQ PINP RIA Orion Diagnostica, Epsoo, Finland). Whilst re￾sults from current assays for PINP are comparable to the results
from ‘healthy’ osteoporosis subjects with normal renal function,
there is a potential for heterogeneity in patients with renal failure
or metastatic bone disease, as it is claimed that the monomeric
fragments may accumulate in these conditions [35, 36]. Pre-an￾alytical advantages of PINP include a low diurnal and intra-indi￾vidual variability, and stability at room temperature. Serum or
plasma is acceptable. A working group of the International Fed￾eration of Clinical Chemistry (IFCC) and International Osteopo￾rosis Foundation (IOF) is planning for the standardization of
commercial assays for s-CTX and s-PINP in collaboration with
commercial manufacturers [21].
BIOCHEMICAL EFFECTS OF OSTEOPOROSIS 
TREATMENT
There are now a number of effective treatments available for os￾teoporosis, as shown by randomized controlled trials, to decrease
fracture risk significantly in the spine, hip and other skeletal sites.
These treatments are listed in Table 2, and are generally classi￾fied either as anti-resorptive agents which have an inhibitory ef￾fect on osteoclasts or as anabolic agents which have a primary
stimulatory effect on osteoblasts (note that the action of strontium
ranelate is not clear even though listed under anabolic agents).
Calcium and vitamin D have a modest effect on reducing bone
loss or improving BMD and decreasing fracture risk, especially
in subjects with inadequate calcium or vitamin D nutrition, such
as institutionalized elderly patients [26]. However, in patients re￾quiring treatment calcium and vitamin D are generally used as
adjuncts to drug therapy.
Bisphosphonates (alendronate, risedronate and zoledronic
acid), the most common drugs for osteoporosis are analogues
of pyrophosphate and potent inhibitors of osteoclast-mediated
bone resorption with major effects on bone remodeling and cal￾cium metabolism. They are extensively used in the treatment of
osteoporosis as well as other bone diseases such as Paget’s
disease (found mainly in western Europeans), osteogenesis im￾perfecta (a rare genetic disorder due to mutations in the type 1
collagen genes COL1A1 and COL1A2), osteolytic bone disease of
malignancy, and hypercalcemia. The biochemical responses to
bisphosphonate therapy are manifold and of interest to clinicians
who prescribe these drugs; the appreciation of the effects of
bisphosphonates on biochemical measurements is vitally impor￾tant for the appropriate interpretation of laboratory investigations
performed during the routine therapeutic use of such drugs.
During treatment with bisphosphonates, the early inhibition of
bone resorption induces a decrease in serum calcium which
stimulates the secretion of PTH [37-40]. The increase in PTH in
turn causes an increase in 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. Thus, a se￾rum PTH which is mildly raised above the upper limit of the ref￾erence interval with normal or low serum calcium, is not an un￾common finding in bisphosphonate-treated patients with meta￾bolic bone disease, especially when there is suboptimal calcium
or vitamin D nutrition. The reduction in serum calcium occurs
within days to weeks of initiation of oral bisphosphonate treat￾ment and earlier with intravenous therapy. These changes may
persist for many weeks to months following the institution of treat￾ment and may be prominent in vitamin D insufficient patients.
Fasting urinary calcium excretion is usually within the refer￾Table 2. Treatments currently available for osteoporosis (orally ad￾ministered unless otherwise indicated)

ence interval in patients with osteoporosis. Following treatment
with bisphosphonates there is a decrease in urine calcium ex￾cretion due to the reduction of calcium egress from the bone as
well as the increased PTH action on the renal tubules to increase
reabsorption of calcium. This urinary calcium conservation may
be accentuated in subjects with inadequate calcium intake and
vitamin D deficiency. It should be noted that calcium supple￾mentation is generally prescribed together with bisphosphonate
therapy.
The reductions in renal phosphate threshold and in serum
phosphate which follow treatment with bisphosphonates are at￾tributed to the effects of PTH on renal tubules as a consequence
of secondary hyperparathyroidism [41]. On the other hand, in
hypoparathyroid patients who are unable to mount a PTH re￾sponse, bisphosphonates have been shown to induce a marked
and sustained increase in serum phosphate and renal tubular
reabsorption of phosphate [42].
The hypocalcemic response to bisphosphonates mentioned
above, although usually mild, can on occasions be severe enough
to be symptomatic and warrant clinical intervention. Most re￾ports of symptomatic hypocalcemia have involved cancer pa￾tients presenting with paresthesia and tetany a few days (up to
2 weeks) after treatment with intravenous bisphosphonates [43,
44]. Patients with hypoparathyroidism would be especially at
risk of this complication, since they would not be able to coun￾teract the hypocalcemic effects of bisphosphonate action.
BTMS FOR MONITORING OSTEOPOROSIS 
TREATMENT
The changes in BTMs following therapy are well documented.
There is a decrease in BTMs following initiation of anti-resorp￾tive therapy, reflecting inhibition of osteoclastic activity [45-53].
For example, with bisphosphonate treatment, there is a decrease
in bone resorption markers within days following intravenous
therapy, and within weeks following oral therapy [45-53]. The
decrease in resorption markers is followed by a later decline in
bone formation markers which also reach their nadir or plateau
(Fig. 1) [54].
In the case of anabolic agents such as teriparatide, after initi￾ation of treatment there is an increase in BTMs, with the bone
formation marker first followed by in resorption marker (Fig. 2)
[55, 56]. In the case of strontium ranelate, there is a small in￾crease in bone formation markers and a small decrease in bone
resorption markers [57]. The use of biochemical markers of bone
remodeling in the monitoring of patients on treatment for osteo￾porosis is generally well-recognized [34, 58]. However, optimum
treatment targets specific to various therapies and the benefits
of monitoring in terms of improvement in fracture outcomes or
in adherence to oral therapies are not established [21].
The theoretical basis for the use of BTMs in monitoring osteo￾porosis treatment is as follows. The aim of treatment is to reduce
fracture risk. Fracture events are not common and in any case
one does not want to wait untill the patient develops a fracture

to determine failure of therapy. Therefore, a surrogate marker is
required to confirm efficacy of treatment. The changes in BMD
and BTMs following the initiation of osteoporosis treatment inde￾pendently correlate with fracture risk reduction [59]. However,
the change in BTMs following treatment explains a greater pro￾portion of treatment effect than the change in BMD does, in
terms of fracture risk reduction [60, 61]. Also, the change in
BMD is small and slow whereas the changes in BTMs are large
and occur early after initiation of therapy. Repeat BMD is not
advocated within 12 months after initiation of therapy as the
changes do not generally attain significance within that time,
and in fact 18-24 months may be appropriate for repeat BMD
measurements [26]. BTMs on the other hand show significant
change by 3-6 months. For example, bone resorption markers
can be measured 3 months after initiation of oral bisphospho￾nates, and bone formation markers 6 months after start of ther￾apy [30, 57]. Significant changes in BTMs may be seen even
earlier with intravenous bisphosphonates. The objective in anti￾resorptive therapy is to reduce BTM levels, if they are increased,
into the pre-menopausal range, or even better, to below the pre￾menopausal mean. In patients with pre-treatment BTMs within
the premenopausal range, a decrease greater than the least sig￾nificant change (LSC) confirms the effect of the medication [57].
The relatively large intra-individual variation in BTMs is often
cited as a problem in their application in practice [62]. This vari￾ation is less in blood than in urine. Also, the LSC for BTMs is
generally calculated using 95% confidence, which is tradition￾ally used in research (i.e. LSC=2.77×CV) [57]. However, this
level of confidence is not the normal in clinical decision making
and may not be needed for the application of BTMs in practice;
a 90% or even 80% confidence may be acceptable [21, 34]. At
this level of confidence together with a one-tailed test (since the
direction of change following each currently available treatments
is known), LSC may be calculated as 1.81×CV or 1.19×CV re￾spectively. This level of change would be seen in most compli￾ant patients following initiation of therapy with antiresorptives
such as bisphosphonate or the new anti-resorptive agent deno￾sumab, as well as anabolic agents such as teriparatide therapy.
An algorithm that may guide the use of BTMs in monitoring os￾teoporosis therapy is shown in Fig. 3. The role of BTMs in moni￾toring strontium ranelate treatment is less clear as the changes
in BTMs with this medication are small.
Further studies are needed to determine optimum monitoring
protocols for different therapies, including optimum treatment
targets for reference standard BTMs, s-PINP, and s-CTX. The
standardization of commercial assays for their measurement will

assist in determining universally applicable cut-offs and targets
which can then be included in guidelines. There is also the need
for evidence that the use of BTMs in monitoring therapy will im￾prove adherence and fracture outcomes.
CONCLUSION
We have shown that although changes in laboratory indices are
not major in osteoporosis, and the measurement of BTMs is not
useful for the diagnosis of osteoporosis, laboratory investigations
are useful in excluding or identifying secondary causes of osteo￾porosis. Although BTMs are independent predictors of fracture
risk, their inclusion in fracture risk calculations will have to await
further data to clarify their contribution to fracture risk and inter￾actions with other risk factors. Changes in BTMs may be useful
in monitoring osteoporosis treatment to confirm compliance with
oral therapies, and efficacy of treatment. Further studies with
reference BTMs are needed to clarify treatment targets for vari￾ous therapies and optimal monitoring regimes.
