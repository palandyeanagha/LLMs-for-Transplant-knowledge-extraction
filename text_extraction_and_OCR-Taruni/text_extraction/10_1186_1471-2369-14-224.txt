Abstract
Background: Patients undergoing hemodialysis are at high risk of falls, with subsequent complications including
fractures, loss of independence, hospitalization, and institutionalization. Factors associated with falls are poorly
understood in this population. We hypothesized that insights derived from studies of the elderly might apply to
adults of all ages undergoing hemodialysis; we focused on frailty, a phenotype of physiological decline strongly
associated with falls in the elderly.
Methods: In this prospective, longitudinal study of 95 patients undergoing hemodialysis (1/2009-3/2010), the
association of frailty with future falls was explored using adjusted Poisson regression. Frailty was classified using the
criteria established by Fried et al., as a combination of five components: shrinking, weakness, exhaustion, low
activity, and slowed walking speed.
Results: Over a median 6.7-month period of longitudinal follow-up, 28.3% of study participants (25.9% of those
under 65, 29.3% of those 65 and older) experienced a fall. After adjusting for age, sex, race, comorbidity, disability,
number of medications, marital status, and education, frailty independently predicted a 3.09-fold (95% CI: 1.38-6.90,
P=0.006) higher number of falls. This relationship between frailty and falls did not differ for younger and older
adults (P=0.57).
Conclusions: Frailty, a validated construct in the elderly, was a strong and independent predictor of falls in adults
undergoing hemodialysis, regardless of age. Our results may aid in identifying frail hemodialysis patients who could
be targeted for multidimensional fall prevention strategies.
Keywords: Hemodialysis, Falls, Frailty
Background
Patients undergoing chronic hemodialysis are at high risk of
falls: 13-25% experience a fall after hemodialysis initiation
[1,2]. This population is also at high-risk for severe compli￾cations after a fall including fractures, loss of independence,
hospitalization, institutionalization, and mortality [3-6]. One
in seven patients undergoing chronic hemodialysis suffers a
major bone fracture after a fall [7]. Additionally, fractures
double the mortality risk in this population [5].
Unfortunately, falls are poorly understood in patients
undergoing hemodialysis. Although some correlates have
been identified, such as age, comorbidities, and number
of medication burden [2,3], the ability to predict which
patients will suffer falls remains limited. Improved risk
prediction would allow for better patient care through
prehabilitation and protective living arrangements.
We hypothesized that insights into falls derived from
studies of the elderly might inform risk prediction in
adults of all ages undergoing chronic hemodialysis; briefly
stated, we hypothesized that frailty would be predictive of
falls in this population. Frailty is a phenotype of physio￾logical decline strongly associated with falls in the elderly
[8,9]. We have identified frailty as important risk factor for
mortality and hospitalization in patients undergoing dialy￾sis of all ages; frailty was independently associated with a
2.60-fold higher risk of death and 1.43-fold higher number
of hospitalizations [10]. To our knowledge, there are no

studies assessing the association between frailty and falls
in patients undergoing chronic hemodialysis. The primary
goal of this study was to identify whether frailty was asso￾ciated with falls independent of other risk factors for falls
in patients undergoing hemodialysis of all ages.
Methods
Study design
This was a longitudinal study of 115 prevalent hemo￾dialysis patients from a single dialysis center in Baltimore,
Maryland, recruited between January 2009 and March
2010. Hemodialysis patients who were 18 years or older,
spoke English, and agreed to participate were recruited
into this study from a hospital-based outpatient dialysis
unit. Frailty was measured at enrollment, and number of
falls was self-reported at a follow-up visit in the 95 pa￾tients who survived at least 5 months. The follow-up visit
was conducted at the dialysis center and was conducted
on average within 6.7 months after enrollment. Demo￾graphics and comorbidities were obtained from medical
record review at enrollment. The Johns Hopkins Institu￾tional Review Board approved the study and all partici￾pants provided informed consent.
Frailty
Frailty was measured as defined and validated by Fried
et al. [8,11-20], as a phenotype based on 5 components:
shrinking (self-report of unintentional weight loss of
more than 10 lbs. in the past year based on dry weight);
weakness (grip-strength below an established cutoff
based on gender and BMI) [8]; exhaustion (self-report);
low activity (Kcals/week below an established cutoff ) [8];
and slowed walking speed (walking time of 15 feet below
an established cutoff by gender and height) [8]. The 5
components of frailty were measured using previously
described methods [8]. A score of 1 was given to those
with the presence of each measured component. The ag￾gregate frailty score was calculated as the sum of the
component scores (range 0-5) and categorized as
nonfrail (0-1), intermediately frail (2), and frail (3-5), as
we previously established in ESRD patients [10].
Statistical analysis
The association between frailty at enrollment and the
number of falls reported during follow-up was estimated
using Poisson regression. All adjusted models were ad￾justed for age, sex, and race. Additional models were
also adjusted for comorbidity (as previously defined by
Fried in the elderly and validated by our group in ESRD
patients, namely 4 or more of the following conditions
ascertained from medical records abstraction: peripheral
vascular disease, rheumatoid arthritis, cancer, hyperten￾sion, COPD, diabetes, congestive heart failure, angina,
and myocardial infarction) [8], disability in activities of
daily living [21] (also previously described by Fried in
the elderly and validated by our group in ESRD patients)
[8], number of medications, education, and marital sta￾tus at enrollment. Interactions between frailty and age
were tested using a Wald test. Additionally, as sensitivity
analyses we tested whether the results were similar when
1) we used negative binomial regression and 2) adjusted
for other factors including anemia, arrhythmia, and cog￾nitive function. All analyses were performed using
STATA 12.0/MP for Linux (College Station, Texas).
Results
Study population
Among 95 study participants, the mean age was 60.5 years
(SD=12.6), 43.6% were over 65, 46.3% were female, and
81.1% were African American; 25.3% of participants were
nonfrail, 28.4% were intermediately frail, and 46.3% were
frail. The median follow-up time was 6.7 months (range
5.0-13.3), which did not differ by frailty (6.7 months vs. 6.7
months, P=0.51) or falls (6.7 months vs. 6.7 months,
P=0.98). The median time on dialysis was 3.7 years.
Falls
During follow-up, 28.3% of participants had one or more
falls. The total number of falls was 70 and maximum
number of falls a single participant experienced was 8
(Figure 1). Participants with one or more falls did not dif￾fer from those without falls based on comorbidity, number
of medications, or education (Table 1). However, there
were notable but not statistically significant differences in
the number of years on chronic hemodialysis (no falls: 6.0
vs. falls: 4.0 years, P=0.17), percent of participants with
prevalent disability (no falls: 17.4% vs. falls: 38.5%,
P=0.054), and percent of participants who were married/
cohabitating (no falls: 27.5% vs. falls: 46.2%, P=0.09). Age
was not statistically associated with falls, with 25.9% of
younger adults and 29.3% of older adults experiencing one
or more falls (P=0.72).
Frailty and falls
Frailty predicted a 3.55-fold (95% CI: 1.68-7.46, P=0.001)
higher number of falls in the unadjusted model and pre￾dicted a 3.89-fold (95% CI: 1.78-8.49, P=0.001) higher num￾ber of falls after adjusting for age, sex, and race (Table 2). In
a separate model that was additionally adjusted for comor￾bidity, disability, number of medications, education, and
marital status, frailty predicted a 3.09-fold (95% CI: 1.38-
6.90, P=0.006) higher number of falls. In all models, inter￾mediate frailty was not itself associated with an increased
number of falls, but there was a statistically significant
trend in the risk of falls from nonfrail to intermediately frail
to frail (all P≤0.001). The association of frailty and number
of falls did not differ for younger and older adults (P=0.57
for interaction between age and frailty).

Sensitivity analyses
The association of frailty and falls was robust to the stat￾istical methods used. Additionally, the adjustment for
anemia (frailty: 2.64, 95% CI: 1.17-5.98), arrhythmias
(frailty: 3.04, 95% CI: 1.36-6.80), and low cognitive

the inferences on the association of frailty and number
of falls.
Discussion
In this single-center study, 28.3% of prevalent hemo￾dialysis patients of all ages had a fall. Frailty was a strong
independent predictor of falls in this population. Frail
patients undergoing chronic hemodialysis experienced
3-times as many falls as their non-frail counterparts.
Frailty was a strong independent predictor of falls in pa￾tients undergoing hemodialysis, regardless of age.
Elderly hemodialysis patients have been found to be at in￾creased risk of falls [22], and thus, most research has fo￾cused on falls in this vulnerable patient population [1,3,6].
Our incidence estimates of falls in patients undergoing
hemodialysis are similar to previous studies [1], but we also
present data that these estimates are similar even in younger
hemodialysis patients. In addition to previously reported
predictors of falls (age, comorbidity, and medication use) we
have introduced frailty as a novel predictor of falls in both
younger and older patients undergoing chronic hemo￾dialysis. In fact, in our study frailty was one of the strongest
predictors of falls in our adjusted model. This study not only
confirms the association between frailty and falls observed
in elderly adults [8,9,23] but extends the findings to patients
undergoing hemodialysis of all ages. In older adults, frailty
has been hypothesized to be a unique disorder that is inde￾pendent of chronic conditions and disability. Our work con￾firms that frailty is an independent phenotype and predictive
of falls, regardless of comorbidities and disability for patients
undergoing hemodialysis.
Frailty, as defined by Fried et al., is a physiologic precursor
and an etiologic factor in the onset of disability [8]. Frailty is
thought to lead to disability and subsequent falls due to
weakness and low endurance. Although frailty is a distinct
phenotype from disability, frailty begins affecting mobility
before clinically important outcomes like falls. Thus, the on￾set of frailty may be the optimal time to initiate interven￾tions to prevent disabilities in mobility and prevent falls.
Strengths of this study were the direct measurement of
a validated, objective frailty instrument, and granular as￾certainment of comorbidities using medical records ab￾straction. Additionally, frailty was ascertained prior to the
report of falls, so its predictive value could be assessed.
The main limitation is the single-center study design, so
direct inferences must be interpreted in the context of the
demographics of our study population. While this study
was conducted in a hospital-based outpatient dialysis unit
in Baltimore, the findings are likely generalizable to pa￾tients undergoing hemodialysis in a community setting
across the US. Additionally, the sample size of the cohort
was small, which will not bias the observed associations,
but did lead to low power to detect subgroup differences.
Although follow-up was limited, we were interested in
ascertaining the number of falls within 6 months from the
measurement of frailty, which does not require longer
follow-up. We had limited ability to adjust for a number
of factors that may be associated with falls (regardless of
the association with frailty); however, the strength of the
association between frailty and falls was similar when ad￾justed for anemia, arrhythmia, and cognitive function. Fi￾nally, survivor bias limits inferences from our finding that
frailty was not associated with time on hemodialysis.
Conclusions
Frailty was identified as a novel risk factor for falls in
adults of all ages undergoing hemodialysis. Additionally,
the results suggest that among older and younger patients
undergoing hemodialysis, frailty increases the short-term
risk of experiencing a fall. Our results may aid in identify￾ing frail hemodialysis patients who could be targeted for
multidimensional fall prevention strategies.
