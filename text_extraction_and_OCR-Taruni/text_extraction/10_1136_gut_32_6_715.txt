Azathioprine induced liver disease: nodular
regenerative hyperplasia of the liver and perivenous
fibrosis in a patient treated for multiple sclerosis
F Mion, B Napoleon, F Berger, M Chevallier, S Bonvoisin, L Descos
Abstract
Azathioprine hepatotoxicity has been des￾cribed mainly in renal transplant recipients.
Most reported cases are related to lesions of
the venous system of the liver: peliosis hepatis,
veno-occlusive disease of the liver, peri￾sinusoidal fibrosis, and nodular regenerative
hyperplasia of the liver. The most common
clinical manifestation ofthese hepatic vascular
lesions is portal hypertension. We present a
case of nodular regenerative hyperplasia and
perivenous fibrosis in a patient receiving aza￾thioprine for multiple sclerosis. Histological
abnormalities were similar to those described
in renal transplant patients, and azathioprine
was the only potential hepatotoxic agent
present.
The hepatic toxicity of azathioprine, a widely
used immunosuppressive drug, was first
reported in an animal model' and has been
reported after renal transplantation in man.2
Cholestatic hepatitis,34 peliosis hepatis,5 hepatic
sinusoidal dilatation,6 veno-occlusive disease of
the liver,78 perisinusoidal and portal fibrosis,9
and nodular regenerative hyperplasia of the
liver'` ' have been the major reported problems.
Most of the cases were described in renal trans￾plant patients. We now report a patient with
nodular regenerative hyperplasia associated with
perivenous fibrosis that developed after aza￾thioprine treatment for multiple sclerosis.

Case report
A 37 year old white man was admitted to hospital
in July 1988 for a first episode of haematemesis.
He had been followed since 1980 for multiple
sclerosis, the primary manifestation ofwhich was

a severe cerebellar syndrome. He had been
treated since 1981 with a daily dose of aza￾thioprine of 100 to 150 mg. Cyclophosphamide
treatment, 500 mg administered intravenously
every other month, was added in 1986. He
received 1 g ofmethylprednisolone intravenously
in 1982, 1985, and June 1988 because of disease
relapses.
There was no history of alcohol abuse, hepatic
disease, previous surgery, or blood transfusions.
There was no sign of rheumatoid arthritis or
other autoimmune disease. On physical examina￾tion, hepatomegaly and splenomegaly were the
only noted abnormalities. Apart from anaemia
caused by the bleeding and moderate thrombo￾cytopenia (113 g/l, normal 150-300 g/l) other
laboratory tests, including serum transaminases,
alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, prothrombin
time, serum albumin, serum protein electro￾phoresis, and immunoelectrophoresis were
within the normal range. Serum concentrations
of ferritin, copper, ceruloplasmin, et, antitrypsin
and ca-fetoprotein were within the normal limits.
Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBs Ag) and HBs
and HBc antibodies were absent. Cytomegalo￾virus, Epstein-Barr, and herpes virus serologies
were negative. Antimitochondrial, antinuclear,
antismooth muscle, and antiendoplasmic reticu￾lum antibodies were absent. Rheumatoid factor
was negative.
The source of the bleeding, shown by upper
gastrointestinal endoscopy, was oesophageal
varices and this was initially controlled by con￾servative measures. Abdominal ultrasonography
confirmed homogeneous hepatosplenomegaly.
Portal and suprahepatic veins were well visual￾ised. Portal vein patency was assessed by
ultrasonographic pulsed doppler. A transparietal
hepatic biopsy specimen was taken for histologi￾cal examination. Azathioprine treatment
was stopped. Despite the administration of
propranolol, 120 mg per day, variceal bleeding
recurred in December 1988. Injection sclero￾therapy of the oesophageal varices was begun.
Because of the patient's poor tolerance of endo￾scopic sclerotherapy, transection and
devascularisation of the oesophagus was per￾formed in March 1989. A hepatic wedge biopsy
specimen was taken at that time. Since then the
patient has been asymptomatic and only one
session of injection sclerotherapy was needed to
eradicate the remaining varices.
Pathology
The first hepatic needle biopsy specimen showed
extensive perivascular fibrosis (Fig 1) that was
most prominent around the hepatic veins and

within the Disse space but was also seen in the
periportal areas. There was no necrosis or inflam￾matory cell infiltration in the portal tracts or in
the parenchyma. Bile ducts were intact. An
imunofluorescence immunoperoxidase assay
for the detection of HBs Ag and HBc Ag was
negative. At laparotomy, the liver was enlarged
and its surface was smooth, without visible
nodulation. The liver was macroscopically fibro￾tic, without visible nodules. Microscopically, the
wedge biopsy specimen showed nodules of
normal hepatocytes surrounded by reticulin
fibres which were detected by the appropriate
stain (Fig 2). The absence of parenchymal
necrosis, inflammatory infiltrate, and alteration
of bile ducts were confirmed in this biopsy
specimen. These abnormalities were interpreted
as typical of nodular regenerative hyperplasia of
the liver with accompanying perivenous fibrosis. A second hepatic needle biopsy specimen
obtained 19 months after the first one (February
1990) showed the persistence of the perivenous
fibrosis together with the nodules of hepatocytes
circled by reticulin fibres. No signs of inflamma- ~ a
tion or necrosis were seen.
Discussion
Hepatic toxicity is not
a common side effect of
azathioprine. Even after long term treatment,
most series report
a rate of hepatic abnormalities
of between
3 and 10%, which are usually limited
to abnormal fiver function tests and minor
changessee2on liver biopsy specimens. ho-in Apart
from
a few cases of azathioprine induced hepa￾titis,n most severe liver inhusies attributed
to azathioprine occurred in renal transplant
patients. Most hepatic lesions described are
vascular, such as peliosis hepatis, veno-occlusive
disease, perisinusoidal fibrosis, hepatoportal
sclerosis, and nodular regenerative hyperplasia.
The main clinical manifestation ofthese lesions is

because it implicates azathioprine as the most
probable aetiologic agent. Corticosteroid treat￾ment had been intermittent and of short duration
and cyclophosphamide has not been reported to
cause vascular hepatic lesions,'7 although the role
of these two drugs cannot be totally dismissed.
A
viral aetiology is doubtful in the absence of
clinical symptoms, lack of histological evidence,
and negative serological studies. Autoimmune
diseases of the liver are also unlikely in the
absence of autoantibodies or inflammatory infil￾trate seen on the biopsy specimens. The hepatic
histology of our patient is interesting because it
brings together several features that can be
related to
a vascular lesion of the liver. The
perivenous fibrosis noted here is present in all
cases of azathioprine induced vascular lesions of
the liver. The amount of fibrosis is variable,
ranging from minute quantities visible only by
electron microscopy9 to extensive fibrosis around
hepatic veins5 or portal tracts.8 Nodular regen￾erative hyperplasia is a lesion that has been
attributed to azathioprine" and the role of peri￾venous fibrosis in its development has been
discussed. We agree with the hypothesis of
Wanless et al'8 and Haboubi et all' that aza￾thioprine may damage endothelial cells lining the
hepatic sinusoids, small hepatic, and portal
veins, leading to extravasion of blood and
development offibrosis around the venous tracts.
This fibrosis could cause portal hypertension,
parenchymal hypoxia, and proliferative response
of hepatocytes and result in the formation of
nodules of hyperplastic hepatocytes typical of
nodular regenerative hyperplasia. These nodules
may also play
a role in the development of portal
hypertension by obstructing normal portal flow.
In patients without renal transplants,
a few
reports describe azathioprine-induced hepa￾titis'920 but there is only one other case report of
primarily vascular hepatic lesions caused by
azathioprine.
A patient receiving azathioprine
for ocular panuveitis was found to have veno￾occlusive disease of the liver.7 Our report high￾lights the fact that these critical hepatic vascular
complications of azathioprine treatment can
indeed occur in patients other than those who
have undergone renal transplantation. Unfor￾tunately, hepatosplenomegaly is often the only
symptom of underlying liver disease and liver
function tests are usually normal. Therefore, the
diagnosis is often made only after portal hyper￾tension has developed. The diagnosis can only be
made by examination of liver biopsy specimens.
If azathioprine induced vascular disease is
suspected, withdrawal of the drug is mandatory,
since stabilisation and improvement of clinical
symptoms and histologic lesions after aza￾thioprine withdrawal has been reported.'° 1 Haxhe JJ, Alexander GPJ, Kestens PJ. The effect of Imuran
