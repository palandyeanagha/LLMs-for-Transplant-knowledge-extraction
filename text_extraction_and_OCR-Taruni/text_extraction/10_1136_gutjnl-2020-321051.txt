COVID-19 in gastroenterology: 
a clinical perspective
We read with interest the article ‘Diar￾rhoea may be underestimated: a missing 
link in 2019 novel coronavirus’ by Liang 
et al.
1
 Indeed, we agree with the authors 
that diarrhoea may be an underestimated 
and under-reported symptom of corona￾virus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Similar 
to data from China, fever and cough 
are the two most commonly reported 
symptoms of COVID-19 in Singapore; 
around 30% of cases were afebrile, 
which may have been due to intensive 
efforts at contact tracing.2 3 In contrast, 
while gastrointestinal symptoms appear 
to be infrequent in China (nausea and 
vomiting: 5.0% and diarrhoea: 3.7%), 
17% of patients with COVID-19 in 
Singapore reported diarrhoea.3
 Interest￾ingly, SARS-CoV2 RNA was detected 
in 50% of patients’ stool samples but 
was not clearly associated with abdom￾inal symptoms. In those with detectable 
faecal virus RNA, approximately half 
had diarrhoea and half had normal stool 
consistency.
Besides the gut, studies suggest 
SARS-CoV2 also affects the liver.
4–6 In a 
study of 148 infected patients in Shanghai, 
50.7% (75/148) had abnormal liver function 
tests (LFTs).4
 However, 29.7% (44/148) had 
abnormal LFTs before admission including 
eight patients with known chronic hepa￾titis B and C. Pre-existing liver disease in
the remaining 36 patients before admis￾sion was indeterminate. 14.9% (22/148) 
of patients with normal tests on admis￾sion developed abnormal LFTs, although 
antiviral therapy may have contributed to 
this. Nonetheless, in a different study of 
99 patients from Wuhan, rates of abnormal 
LFTs were similar at 43.4% (43/99).5
 Only 
one patient had significantly elevated 
results: alanine transaminase 7590U/L and
aspartate transaminase 1445U/L; acute 
liver failure has not been reported as yet. 
The pattern of derangement reported in 
current studies show mainly a hepatic 
transaminitis; elevated serum alkaline 
phosphate and bilirubin are infrequent. 
Confounding factors such as pre-existing
liver disease and drug-induced liver injury
has been acknowledged and pose challenges 
to researchers.6
 Furthermore, histological 
analyses of SARS-CoV2 affected liver tissue
are unreported, and the mechanism of liver 
injury remains poorly understood. In our 
cohort, elevation in LFTs was associated 
with the use of lopinavir and ritonavir. All 
normalised with cessation, as did any asso￾ciated gastrointestinal complaints, although 
this may have been influenced by resolution 
of infection.
SARS-CoV2 transmission is likely to 
be through droplets, whether from direct 
contact or indirectly via fomites. It is postu￾lated that SARS-CoV2 binds to host ACE 
2 receptors (ACE2) on target cells to gain 
entry, possibly with the assistance of trans￾membrane serine protease 2.7 8 ACE2 is 
recognised as an important regulator of 
intestinal inflammation, and many hypoth￾esise this is the mechanism by which diar￾rhoea in COVID-19 is caused.9
 However, 
while SARS-CoV2 RNA is detectable in half
of stool samples, confirmation of viability 
from viral culture is lacking.3 10 Given the 
above, and the variations in disease presen￾tation and time course, it is highly probable 
that the cause of diarrhoea in COVID-19 is 
multifactorial. Interestingly, ACE2 receptors 
are also highly expressed within the biliary 
tree, but cholestatic liver disease is not a 
common feature of COVID-19.11 Given 
the factors discussed above, abnormal LFTs 
in COVID-19 is probably multifactorial as 
well.
The interactions and effect of SARS-CoV2
on oesophagus, stomach, biliary tree and 
pancreas are unreported at present, but 
these could surface in literature in due 
course as detection methods, disease char￾acterisation and animal models are being 
improved.2
Therefore, as SARS-CoV2 spreads across
all major continents, it is important that 
gastroenterologists remain vigilant for 
variant cases that mimic atypical pneu￾monia, gastroenteritis, viral hepatitis or 
dengue fever.12 Another important consid￾eration is endoscopy, which carries a risk 
of disease transmission if attending health￾care workers are not wearing appropriate 
personal protective equipment. Upper 
gastrointestinal endoscopy can induce 
coughing and lower gastrointestinal endos￾copy can generate aerosol droplets as air 
is expelled from patients. Unrecognised 
community transmission of COVID-19 
will also have significant implications on 
patient selection, endoscopy practices and 
how patients are managed postprocedure. 
National guidance on endoscopy prac￾tices and local contingencies in endoscopy 
units for possible or confirmed COVID-19 
patients may soon be necessary if infection 
rates rise significantly.
