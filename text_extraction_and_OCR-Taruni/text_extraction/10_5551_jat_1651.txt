Aim: Ezetimibe is a novel cholesterol absorption inhibitor that reduces the level of low-density lipo￾protein (LDL)-cholesterol (C). The effects of ezetimibe on remnant-like particle (RLP)-C, lipopro￾tein (a) [Lp(a)], and oxidized LDL (Ox-LDL) levels have not been examined.
Methods: Fifty patients with dyslipidemia were treated with 10 mg/day of ezetimibe. At baseline and 
12 weeks after treatment with ezetimibe, we measured the levels of RLP-C, Lp(a), Ox-LDL, and 
high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP).
Results: The mean levels of total cholesterol (TC), LDL-C, triglycerides (TG), and apolipoprotein 
(apo) B, respectively, showed a significant decrease from 229±39 to 191±37 mg/dL (－16%, p＜
0.0001), from 151±34 to 118±33 mg/dL (－22%, p＜0.0001), from 162±82 to 135±55 mg/dL 
(－7%, p＜0.01), and from 116±22 to 94±21 mg/dL (－18%, p＜0.0001) after 12 weeks of treat￾ment with ezetimibe. The mean level of RLP-C and median level of hs-CRP also decreased signifi￾cantly from 6.8±4.0 to 4.8±2.5 mg/dL (－21%, p＜0.0001) and from 0.6 to 0.4 mg/L (－33%, p＜
0.05). The median level of Lp(a) decreased significantly from 14 to 10 mg/dL (－29%, p＜0.05) in 
patients treated with ezetimibe monotherapy.
Conclusions: Ezetimibe was effective for reducing the levels of TC, LDL-C, TG, and RLP-C. Ezeti￾mibe could be a potential therapeutic option for decreasing the Lp(a) level.

nificantly reduces the risk of coronary events com￾pared with moderate lipid-lowering therapy3); how￾ever, recent studies have shown that the majority of 
patients, especially those in the highest risk category, 
fail to reach target lipid levels with statin monother￾apy4, 5). In addition, some patients suffer from side 
effects when the statin dose is increased in an attempt 
to achieve the target.
Ezetimibe is a cholesterol absorption inhibitor 
that potently inhibits the absorption of biliary and 
dietary cholesterol by the brush border of the intestine 
without affecting the absorption of fat-soluble vita￾mins or triglycerides (TG) 6, 7). Ezetimibe appears to 
inhibit cholesterol absorption by binding to the cho￾lesterol transporter, Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 (NPC1L1) 
protein8). When co-administered with a statin, ezeti￾mibe achieves a significant incremental reduction of 
the low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol (C) 
Introduction
Introduction of the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl 
coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins)

and numerous clinical trials have shown that statins 
can significantly reduce the incidence of coronary 
artery disease (CAD) in both primary and secondary 
prevention settings1, 2). It has also been demonstrated

level compared with statin monotherapy 9-11).
Increased levels of remnant-like particle (RLP)- 
C12), lipoprotein (a) [Lp(a)]13), and oxidized LDL (Ox￾LDL)14) have been recognized as risk factors for CAD. 
RLP-C15, 16) and Ox-LDL16) are both decreased by 
statin therapy; however, the effect of statin therapy on 
Lp(a) is controversial, although some studies have 
demonstrated that statins can reduce the Lp(a) level 17).
It also remains unclear whether ezetimibe can 
reduce the levels of RLP-C, Lp(a), and Ox-LDL. In 
the present study, we prospectively evaluated the influ￾ence of ezetimibe on RLP-C, Lp(a), and Ox-LDL lev￾els in patients with dyslipidemia.
Materials and Methods
Subjects
Fifty patients with dyslipidemia (male/female= 
22/28, mean age=70±9 years) who did not achieve 
target lipid levels according to Japan Atherosclerosis 
Society guidelines 18) when treated with diet, exercise, 
and/or statin therapy were administered 10 mg/day 
ezetimibe. Ezetimibe was added to statin therapy in 
25 patients and the other 25 patients were treated 
with ezetimibe alone. Patients were excluded from the 
study for the following reasons: (1) treatment with 
non-statin lipid-lowering drugs (fibrates, nicotinic acid, 
colestyramine, and probucol), (2) severe liver dysfunc￾tion, (3) dyslipidemia associated with hypothyroidism, 
nephrotic syndrome, gallbladder obstruction, biliary 
disease, pancreatitis, or immunologic abnormalities, 
such as collagen diseases, (4) alcoholism or heavy alco￾hol intake, (5) dyslipidemia induced by steroids or 
other drugs, (6) diabetic patients who were receiving 
insulin or who were poorly controlled [hemoglobin 
A1c (HbA1c) ＞8.0%], and (7) any other reason for 
which the patient was considered inappropriate for 
this study by the attending physician.
At baseline and 12 weeks after treatment with 
ezetimibe, we measured the levels of RLP-C, Lp(a), 
Ox-LDL, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs￾CRP). In patients with previously diagnosed diabetes 
mellitus (DM) or impaired glucose tolerance, HbA1c 
was also measured. Anti-diabetic drugs were not 
changed during the study period. Written informed 
consent was obtained from all patients, and the Ethics 
Committee of Yokohama Sakae Kyosai Hospital 
approved the study protocol.
Laboratory Determination
Blood samples were obtained after an overnight 
fast. Serum levels of total cholesterol (TC), LDL-C, 
high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-C, and TG were mea￾sured by standard enzymatic methods. Serum levels of 
apolipoproteins, RLP-C, Lp(a), Ox-LDL, and hs-CRP 
were measured at a central laboratory (SRL Inc., 
Tokyo, Japan). The serum level of RLP-C was mea￾sured by an immune-separation technique 19), Lp(a) 
was measured by a latex agglutination assay 20), and 
Ox-LDL was measured by an enzyme immunoas￾say21), as previously described.
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analyses were performed with Statview 
5.0 software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA). Results 
are expressed as the mean±SD or median (range). 
Differences in continuous variables between groups 
were compared by the unpaired t-test when the vari￾able showed a normal distribution, or by the Mann￾Whitney U-test when it did not. Differences in con￾tinuous variables within each group were compared by 
the paired t-test when the variable showed a normal 
distribution, or by the Wilcoxon signed-ranks test 
when it did not. The significance of differences in per￾centages was analyzed by the chi-square test. Univari￾ate linear regression analyses were performed to assess 
the relation between the mean change of RLP-C and 
various other parameters. Stepwise regression analysis 
was also performed to identify factors that were inde￾pendently associated with the reduction of RLP-C lev￾els. A significant difference was defined as p＜0.05.
Results
The baseline characteristics of the patients are 
shown in Table 1. There were 22 men and 28 women 
with a mean age of 70±9 years. The mean baseline 
levels of TC, LDL-C, HDL-C, TG, RLP-C, and 
Ox-LDL were 229±39 mg/dL, 151±34 mg/dL, 61±
15 mg/dL, 162±82 mg/dL, 6.8±4.0 mg/dL, and 
10.2±6.8 U/mL, respectively. The median baseline 
level of Lp(a) was 14 mg/dL. TC and LDL-C levels 
were significantly lower in the ezetimibe+statin group. 
Patients in this group were already being treated with 
statins because of a history of CAD and/or DM.
The effects of ezetimibe administration on lipid 
parameters, hs-CRP, FPG, and HbA1c are shown in 
Table 2. The levels of TC, LDL-C, TG, non-HDL-C, 
and apolipoprotein (apo) B respectively showed a sig￾nificant decrease from 229±39 to 191±37 mg/dL 
(－16%, p＜0.0001), from 151±34 to 118±33 mg/dL 
(－22%, p＜0.0001), from 162±82 to 135±55 mg/ 
dL (－7%, p＜0.01), from 168±36 to 130±34 mg/dL 
(－22%, p＜0.0001), and from 116±22 to 94±21 
mg/dL (－18%, p＜0.0001) after 12 weeks of treat￾ment with ezetimibe. HDL-C showed no significant

change, whereas the LDL-C/HDL-C ratio decreased 
significantly from 2.6±0.8 to 2.0±0.8 (p＜0.0001). 
The administration of ezetimibe did not significantly 
affect the ratio of LDL-C to apo B. RLP-C decreased 
significantly from 6.8±4.0 to 4.8±2.5 mg/dL (－21%, 
p＜0.0001), but Ox-LDL was not decreased by ezeti￾Table 1. Baseline characteristics of the subjects

40 Nozue et al. Effects of Ezetimibe on RLP-C and Lp(a) 41
mibe therapy was useful for reducing RLP-C levels. 
Although Ox-LDL was not decreased, Lp(a) was 
reduced by ezetimibe monotherapy.
The percent change of TC, LDL-C, TG, non￾HDL-C, apo B, and RLP-C after 12 weeks of treat￾ment with ezetimibe was －16%, －22%, －7%, －22%, 
－18%, and －21%, respectively. These percent changes 
tended to be larger in the ezetimibe＋statin group, 
but the differences were not statistically significant. 
According to previous reports, ezetimibe monotherapy 
achievesd an approximately 17−18% reduction of 
LDL-C9, 22). When added to statin, ezetimibe pro￾ducesd a significant 21−23% additional mean percent 
reduction of LDL-C compared with statin monother￾apy10, 11). Thus, combining ezetimibe with a statin 
leads to incremental reduction of LDL-C.
In the present study, the RLP-C level was also 
decreased by ezetimibe therapy and the mean change 
of RLP-C was positively correlated with the mean 
change of TG. What is the mechanism through which 
RLP-C is reduced by ezetimibe therapy ? In order 
to maintain stable cholesterol homeostasis, entero￾cytes regulate the uptake and secretion of cholesterol. 
NPC1L1 protein is involved in the direct uptake of 
cholesterol from the intestinal lumen. Since ezetimibe 
inhibits this protein function, it seems likely that ezet￾imibe therapy would lead to qualitative or quantitative 
changes of apo B-48-containing particles. Less choles￾terol would be transported in chylomicrons, implying 
a reduction of cholesterol reaching the liver in chylo￾micron remnants8, 23). This decrease of chylomicrons is 
the first reason for the reduction of RLP-C with ezeti￾mibe therapy. In addition, a decrease of hepatic cho￾lesterol 23, 24) and an increase of hepatic LDL receptor 
(LDLR) expression24) has been reported in ezetimibe￾treated mice. Temel et al. studied transgenic mice with 
overexpression of human NPC1L1 by hepatocytes, 
and found a decrease of biliary cholesterol in associa￾tion with a 30−60% increase of plasma cholesterol 25). 
Since these changes were blocked by treatment with 
ezetimibe, ezetimibe may reduce plasma cholesterol by 
inhibiting NPC1L1 activity in both the intestine and 
liver 25). This reduction of hepatic cholesterol is the 
second reason for the decrease of RLP-C with ezeti￾mibe therapy. It seems possible that these effects of 
ezetimibe could alleviate hepatic steatosis and lead to 
the improvement of insulin resistance 26). Indeed, the 
present study showed that FPG, HbA1c, and ALP lev￾els were decreased significantly by ezetimibe therapy. 
Furthermore, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), ala￾nine aminotransferase (ALT), and γ-glutamyl trans￾Table 4. Stepwise regression coefficient, F value, and adjusted R2

42 Nozue et al. Effects of Ezetimibe on RLP-C and Lp(a) 43
peptidase (γ-GTP) levels were decreased by ezetimibe 
therapy in some patients (data not shown). This 
improvement of insulin resistance is the third reason 
for the decrease of RLP-C with ezetimibe therapy.
There are only limited data on the effects of 
ezetimibe on the lipoproteins profile. Kalogirou et 
al. reported that ezetimibe monotherapy significantly 
reduced the concentrations of all LDL subfractions 27). 
Furthermore, the reduction of small dense (sd)-LDL 
subfractions was greater than that of large buoyant 
fractions. Although ezetimibe administration induced 
a shift towards larger LDL particles, the ratio of 
LDL-C to apo B (that has been used as a marker of 
sd-LDL) was not significantly affected27). Thus, some 
studies demonstrated that the ratio of LDL-C to apo 
B was not an accurate marker of the distribution of 
LDL subfractions27, 28). Indeed, the administration of 
ezetimibe did not significantly affect the ratio of 
LDL-C to apo B in the present study.
There is strong evidence that oxidized lipopro￾teins, particularly Ox-LDL, play a key role in the 
pathogenesis of atherosclerosis 14), but the mechanisms 
by which lipoproteins are oxidized are still not well 
understood. Lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 
(Lp-PLA2) degrades the short-chain sn-2-analogs of 
phosphatidylcholine generated upon Ox-LDL29). A 
higher Lp-PLA2 level was strongly associated with an 
increased risk of CAD30). It has been reported that 
statins decrease the Lp-PLA2 level31), reduce the sus￾ceptibility of LDL to oxidation32), and lead to the 
reduction of Ox-LDL16). The reasons why Ox-LDL 
could not be decreased by ezetimibe therapy are 
unclear. We speculate that ezetimibe could not influ￾ence the Lp-PLA2 level and oxidization of LDL dur￾ing circulation, though it inhibits the incorporation of 
dietary oxidized cholesterol into lipoproteins33). Fur￾ther studies are necessary to clarify whether ezetimibe 
affects the level of Ox-LDL.
Lp(a) is a cholesteryl ester- and apo B-containing 
particle that differs from LDL due to the presence of 
a glycoprotein termed apo(a), which is homologous 
with plasminogen. No specific Lp(a)-lowering agents 
have been discovered. The effect of statins on Lp(a) is 
controversial, although some studies have demon￾strated that statins can reduce the Lp(a) level 17). In the 
present study, the median level of Lp(a) was decreased 
by 29% due to ezetimibe monotherapy. Though the 
Lp(a) level is mainly determined by genetic variation 
of the apo(a) gene 34), hypercholesterolemia is associ￾ated with a high Lp(a) level 35). The mechanism through 
which Lp(a) is decreased by ezetimibe remains unclear. 
The reduction of the Lp(a) level may be partly 
explained by an anti-inflammatory effect of ezeti￾mibe, because the Lp(a) level is correlated with those 
of acute-phase reactants in hypercholesterolemic 
patients36).
It has been reported that hs-CRP predicts mor￾bidity and mortality from CAD37). Statins reduce the 
hs-CRP level in a manner largely independent of the 
LDL-C level 38) and statin plus ezetimibe therapy 
reduces the hs-CRP level more effectively than statin 
monotherapy10). In the present study, hs-CRP was 
decreased significantly by ezetimibe therapy. Previous 
data suggest that ezetimibe reduces hs-CRP when 
given in combination with other agents only9); how￾ever, recent studies have reported that ezetimibe mono￾therapy also has an anti-inflammatory effect 39, 40). 
There was no correlation between the reduction of 
hs-CRP and LDL-C in the present study (data not 
shown), which was also reported previously39). This 
effect of ezetimibe is pleiotropic, because it is not 
absorbed into the circulation but acts locally by inhib￾iting cholesterol absorption from the small intestine. 
Further studies are necessary to clarify the mechanisms 
of ezetimibe for reducing the hs-CRP level.
In conclusions, ezetimibe therapy decreased the 
levels of TC, LDL-C, TG, and RLP-C. Ezetimibe 
shows an anti-atherogenic effect by not only reducing 
the LDL-C level, but also the RLP-C level. Ezetimibe 
could be a potential therapeutic option for decreasing 
the Lp(a) level.
Study Limitations
There are some limitations with regard to the 
interpretation of our results. Because there were only 
50 patients in the study, the small sample size meant 
that analysis of the response of RLP-C, Lp(a), and 
Ox-LDL to ezetimibe therapy was limited. Further￾more, apo B-48 and apo B-100 were not measured 
separately in the present study.
