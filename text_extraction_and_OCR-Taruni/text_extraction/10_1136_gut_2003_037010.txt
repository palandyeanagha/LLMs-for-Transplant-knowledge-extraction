Background: Adiponectin, an adipocyte derived polypeptide, has been shown to alleviate steatosis and
inflammation in mice with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.
Aim: In the present study, we wished to define liver expression of adiponectin and its receptors in morbidly
obese patients undergoing bariatric surgery. Patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) or simple
steatosis were investigated to test whether dysregulation of this system might be involved in these disorders.
Patients and methods: Liver mRNA expression of adiponectin and its recently cloned receptors RI and RII
(adipoRI and adipoRII) were analysed by fluorescence based real time polymerase chain reaction in 13
patients with NASH and nine with simple steatosis. Adiponectin and adipoRII protein expression were
assessed by immunohistochemistry in a subgroup of patients.
Results: Adiponectin and adipoRII mRNA expression were significantly reduced in liver biopsies of patients
with NASH compared with simple steatosis while no difference was found in adipoRI mRNA expression. In
NASH, adipoRII mRNA expression was negatively correlated with serum aspartate aminotransferase
levels, serum alanine aminotransferase levels, and grade of fibrosis. Liver adiponectin protein expression
was mainly found in endothelial cells of portal vessels and liver sinusoids whereas adipoRII expression was
seen in hepatocytes only. Adiponectin and adipoRII staining were lower in biopsies of subjects with NASH
compared with simple steatosis.
Conclusion: Reduced hepatic expression of adiponectin and adipoRII might be of pathophysiological
relevance in non-alcoholic fatty liver diseases.
Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is frequently
associated with abdominal obesity, hypertension,
and diabetes. Insulin resistance has been implicated
as a key mechanism in the pathogenesis of NASH. Numerous
substances, mainly released by adipocytes, are thought to
contribute to peripheral insulin resistance. These include
proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-6 and
tumour necrosis factor a (TNF-a) as well as leptin, resistin,
and also acrp30/adiponectin/adipoQ.1 2 Adiponectin is an
antidiabetic and antiatherogenic acting polypeptide that is
strongly correlated with systemic insulin sensitivity in
humans.134 Adiponectin increases fatty acid beta oxidation
in muscle,5 improves postabsorptive insulin mediated sup￾pression of hepatic glucose output by enhancing hepatic
insulin action,6 and decreases lipid accumulation in macro￾phages.7 Beyond its metabolic effects, adiponectin also has
direct anti-inflammatory effects.8
Xu et al reported that adiponectin administration alleviates
non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in mice. In detail, adminis￾tration of adiponectin improved hepatomegaly and steatosis,
attenuated inflammation, and elevated levels of serum
alanine aminotransferase in ob/ob mice.9
Recently, cloning of adiponectin receptors I and II (adipoRI
and adipoRII) was reported.10 While in mice adipoRI is
abundantly expressed in skeletal muscle, adipoRII is pre￾dominantly expressed in the liver. AdipoRI and adipoRII
mediate increased AMP kinase and peroxisome proliferator
activated receptor (PPAR)-a ligand activities, fatty acid
oxidation, and glucose uptake by adiponectin, respectively.
Based on these functional characteristics of the adiponec￾tin/adipoRI/adipoRII system, we hypothesised that dysregu￾lation of this system could contribute to the development of
NASH in obese subjects. We therefore determined liver
expression of adiponectin and its receptors in morbidly obese
patients undergoing elective bariatric surgery and compared
patients with NASH with those with simple steatosis.
METHODS
Study design
Twenty two patients with a diagnosis of obesity undergoing
bariatric surgery by performing a biliopancreatic diversion
consisting of a partial gastrectomy with a distal Roux-en-Y
reconstruction participated in this study. Subjects with a
history of excessive drinking or other liver diseases, including
alcoholic liver disease, viral hepatitis, autoimmune hepatitis,
primary biliary cirrhosis, haemochromatosis, Wilson’s dis￾ease, or a1 antitrypsin deficiency were excluded from the
study. In 13 patients, NASH was defined as a clinical and
pathological entity characterised by the presence of steatosis
as well as lobular and/or portal inflammation with or without
fibrosis11; in nine patients histologically confirmed simple
steatosis was diagnosed. Liver fibrosis (scale 0–4) and
steatosis (grade 0–3) were assessed semiquantitatively and
necroinflammatory activity was determined as described
recently.11 None of the patients had signs of hepatic
complications, heart failure, organic renal disease, associated
autoimmune conditions, cancer, or any other severe illness.
Informed written consent was obtained from all subjects.

Laboratory measurements
Venous blood was drawn after an overnight fast and plasma
or serum was obtained by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for
10 minutes at 4˚C immediately after blood collection. Plasma
and serum samples were either used immediately for analysis
or were stored frozen at 280˚C.
Insulin sensitivity was estimated by the homeostasis model
assessment (HOMA) index.12 Aspartate aminotransferase
(AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), gamma glutamyl
transferase (c-GT), insulin, and glucose concentrations were
measured using commercially available enzymatic kits.
Serum adiponectin concentrations were determined using
a commercially available radioimmunoassay kit (Linco
Research Inc, St Charles, Missouri, USA).
RNA isolation
Liver biopsies were collected by Tru-cut from each subject.
Total RNA was extracted from frozen liver by the acid
guanidinium phenol chloroform method using Trizol reagent
(Gibco, Gaithersburg, Maryland, USA). Extracted RNA was
quantified by spectrophotometry. Reverse transcription of
1 mg of RNA was performed using the Omniscript RT Kit
(Qiagen, Hilden, Germany).
Fluorescence based real time polymerase chain
reaction
mRNA of adipoRI, adipoRII, and adiponectin were estimated
by quantification of adipoRI, adipoRII, adiponectin, and
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) cDNA
by the TaqMan real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
(Perkin Elmer, Vienna, Austria) method expressed as
adipoRI/GAPDH cDNA ratio, adipoRII/GAPDH cDNA ratio,
and adiponectin/GAPDH cDNA ratio, respectively.
For generation of the standard curve, serially diluted cDNA
prepared from human HepG2 cells (adipoRI, adipoRII) and
human SGBS cells (adiponectin) were used. Briefly, 2.5 ml of
each reverse transcription served as template in a 25 ml PCR
containing 12.5 ml Taq Man Universal Polymerase Master
Mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, California, USA),
2.25 ml (10 pmol/ml) of each oligonucleotide primer (MWG
Ebersberg, Germany), 0.5 ml of Taq Man probe (10 nmol/ml)
(Microsynth, Baglach, Switzerland), and 5 ml aqua dest.
TaqMan probes were labelled with the reporter fluorescent
dye 6-carboxyfluorescein (FAM) at the 59 end and with the
quencher 6-carboxy-tetramethyl-rhodamine (TAMRA) at the
39 end. AdipoRI, adipoRII, and adiponectin quantities were
normalised to the amount of GAPDH cDNA which was
determined using the GAPDH reaction mix. The PCR reaction
was performed in triplicate in MicroAmp 96 well reaction
plates (Perkin Elmer); amplification was carried out in
the AbiPrism 7700 Sequence Detector (Perkin Elmer).
Amplification conditions were two minutes at 50˚C, 10 min￾utes at 95˚C, followed by 40 cycles of 15 seconds at 95˚C, and
one minute at 60˚C. Results were analysed using the
Sequence Detector 1.6 software.
Oligonucleotide primers and TaqMan probes were designed
using Primer express software (Perkin-Elmer Applied
Biosystems, Warrington, UK). Primers included: adipoRI:

Immunohistochemistry
Immunohistochemistry for adiponectin and adipoRII was
performed in liver biopsies in a subgroup of study subjects
(five patients with NASH and five with simple steatosis).
Polyclonal antibodies against human adiponectin and human
adipoRII were purchased from R&D Systems (McKinley
Place, Minnesota, USA) and Phoenix Pharmaceuticals
(Belmont, California, USA), respectively. Sections (4 mm)
were prepared from formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue
specimens, deparaffinised, and rehydrated in graded alco￾hols. A heat induced epitope retrieval technique by autoclav￾ing slides for several minutes in 10 mM citric acid buffer was
used for detection of adiponectin and its receptors. After
quenching endogenous peroxidase with 3% H2O2 in phos￾phate buffered saline for 10 minutes, slides were incubated
with primary antibodies at 4˚C overnight (antihuman
adiponectin pAb, 1 mg/ml; antihuman adipoRII pAb,
3 mg/ml). Specificity for adiponectin was demonstrated by
blocking the primary antibody with recombinant human
adiponectin (R&D Systems) at 4˚C overnight. Solid phase
absorbed rabbit Ig fraction (DakoCytomation, Glostrup,
Denmark) was used to demonstrate specificity of adipoRII
pAb staining. Visualisation was performed using the LSAB+
kit (DakoCytomation) with 3, 39-diaminobenzidine as chro￾mogen according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Sections

were counterstained with haematoxylin, dehydrated, and
mounted permanently in Eukitt (O Kindler GmbH, Freiburg,
Germany). Finally, sections were viewed on an Olympus
IX70 with Kappa camera and Kappa ImageBase 2.2 soft￾ware (Kappa opto-electronics GmbH, Gleichen, Germany).
Staining intensity was semiquantitatively assessed in a
blinded fashion by assigning an arbitrary value of 1, 2, or 3
(reflecting weak, intermediate, and bright staining) to each
specimen.
Statistical analysis
Differences between groups were calculated using the
Student’s t test for independent samples. Statistical signifi￾cance was inferred at a two tailed p value of less than 0.05.
Correlation coefficients were calculated using Pearson’s
method. Descriptive data are expressed as mean (SEM).
SPSS for windows (version 11.0) was used for statistical
analysis.
RESULTS
Clinical characteristics
Clinical characteristics of study subjects are summarised in
table 1. Body mass index, AST, ALT, c-GT, and insulin
sensitivity estimated by the HOMA index were similar in
patients with NASH and simple steatosis. Serum adiponectin
levels measured by radioimmunoassy were similar in patients
with NASH (5.38 (0.92) mg/ml) and those with simple
steatosis (6.86 (1.15) mg/ml; p = 0.18).
Hepatic mRNA expression
While the adipoRI/GAPDH cDNA ratio tended to be lower in
liver biopsies of subjects with NASH without reaching
statistical significance (4.91 (0.62) v 6.71 (2.03); p = 0.08),
the adipoRII/GAPDH cDNA ratio was significantly decreased
in liver biopsies of patients with NASH compared with those
with simple steatosis (3.91 (0.35) v 7.96 (2.37); p = 0.04). The
adiponectin/GAPDH cDNA ratio was significantly lower in
liver biopsies of patients with NASH (0.15 (0.07)) compared
with those with simple steatosis (0.66 (0.62); p = 0.01).
AdipoRI/GAPDH, adipoRII/GAPDH, and adiponectin/GAPDH
cDNA ratios are shown in fig 1.
Liver TNF-a cDNA/b-actin cDNA ratio, as determined by
semiquantitative PCR analysis,11 was significantly higher in
patients with NASH compared with those with simple
steatosis (0.95 (0.16) v 0.22 (0.08); p,0.01) while liver
TNF-a receptor type I (p55) and TNF-a receptor type II (p75)
mRNA expression were similar in both groups.
Immunohistochemistry
Immunohistochemistry for adiponectin and adipoRII (fig 2)
was performed in liver biopsies in a subgroup of our study
patients (five with NASH and five with simple steatosis).
Adiponectin protein expression was localised primarily to
endothelial cells of portal vessels and liver sinusoids.
Adiponectin staining was less pronounced in endothelial
cells of liver sinusoids in patients with NASH (fig 2D, E)
compared with subjects with simple steatosis (fig 2A–C) (1.4
(0.24) v 2.25 (0.25); p = 0.05). AdipoRII protein was localised
to hepatocytes showing a predominantly cytoplasmic staining
pattern. AdipoRII staining again tended to be less pro￾nounced in liver biopsies of subjects with NASH (fig 2H)
compared with subjects with simple steatosis (fig 2G) (1.6
(0.25) v 2.25 (0.25); p = 0.11).

other laboratory measurements
In subjects with NASH, adipoRII/GAPDH cDNA ratio was
negatively correlated with AST (r = 20.68, p = 0.02), ALT

(r = 20.73, p = 0.01), and histological grade of fibrosis
(r = 20.58, p = 0.04). Hepatic adiponectin mRNA expression
was positively correlated with grade of steatosis in patients
with simple steatosis (r = 0.969, p = 0.03) while no correla￾tion was found between these parameters in subjects with
NASH. Adiponectin/GAPDH cDNA expression was signifi￾cantly correlated with serum levels of c-GT (r = 0.86,
p = 0.01) and alkaline phosphatase (r = 0.62, p = 0.04) in
subjects with NASH. No correlations were observed with
these laboratory parameters in patients with simple steatosis.
No correlation was found between adipoRI/GAPDH cDNA
ratio and AST and ALT levels. Furthermore, there was no
correlation between serum adiponectin and hepatic adipo￾nectin, adipoRI, or adipoRII mRNA expression in any group,
respectively.
When subjects with NASH and simple steatosis were
analysed together, hepatic adiponectin mRNA expression
was correlated with liver TNF-a receptor type I (p55)
mRNA expression (r = 0.51, p = 0.05) while no correlation
between these parameters was found when subjects with
NASH or simple steatosis were considered separately.
Furthermore, no correlation was identified between mRNA
expression of hepatic adiponectin or its receptors and liver
TNF-a/TNF-a receptor type II (p75) mRNA expression in any
group.
DISCUSSION
The aim of this study was to define a potential role of
adipocyte derived adiponectin and its receptors adipoRI and
adipoRII in the pathogenesis of NASH in patients with severe
obesity. Our results suggest that in NASH, local effects of
adiponectin are limited through two different mechanisms:
(i) decreased adiponectin mRNA expression and (ii)
decreased mRNA expression of hepatic adipoRII.
Furthermore, we observed a negative correlation between
adipoRII/GAPDH cDNA ratio and AST and ALT levels and
grade of fibrosis. Our immunohistochemistry data further
support the notion that adiponectin and adipoRII are
diminished in NASH.
In contrast with adipoRII, hepatic adipoRI mRNA expres￾sion was similar in NASH and simple steatosis. While
adipoRII is predominantly expressed in the liver,10 adipoRI
is mainly expressed in skeletal muscle,10 13 suggesting that
in the liver the effects of adiponectin are predomin￾antly mediated by adipoRII. While adipoRI is a high
affinity receptor for globular adiponectin, adipoRII can
mediate binding of both globular and full length
adiponectin and thus can increase PPAR-a ligand activity
and fatty acid oxidation by globular and full length
adiponectin.10
Notably, adiponectin was mainly localised to endothelial
cells of portal vessels and liver sinusoids while adipoRII was
exclusively detected in hepatocytes. This may suggest that
this hormone/receptor pair could function in a paracrine way
in the liver and this interaction could be impaired in NASH.
Furthermore, we found no correlation between circulating
adiponectin levels and liver adiponectin expression. This
could suggest that liver adiponectin expression is regulated
by different factors, for example, proinflammatory cytokines
such as TNF-a.
Recently, it was reported that TNF-a and adiponectin
suppress each other’s production and are also able to
antagonise each other’s action.8 Therefore, reduced adipo￾nectin mRNA expression might be partially due to these
suppressive effects of elevated TNF-a expression in NASH.11 14
In fact, we found increased liver TNF-a mRNA expression in
subjects with NASH. Lack of a negative correlation between
hepatic adiponectin mRNA expression and liver TNF-a
mRNA expression might simply be due to the small number
of subjects studied.
Decreased adiponectin liver activity may result in
decreased fatty oxidation, glucose uptake, and reduced
PPAR-a activity (which acts as the molecular target for lipid
lowering fibrates and is strongly involved in hepatic fatty acid
catabolism). Reduced effects of adiponectin on hepatic fatty
acid metabolism could contribute to the development of
steatohepatitis in patients with NASH. Our hypothesis is
supported by the findings of Xu and colleagues9 who
investigated the effects of adiponectin administration in ob/
ob mice. The authors reported enhanced hepatic fatty acid
oxidation and decreased acetyl-CoA carboxylase and fatty
acid synthase activities—two key enzymes of fatty acid
synthesis—after adiponectin delivery, resulting in reduced
steatosis.
Recently, long term treatment with the PPAR-c agonist
rosiglitazone improved not only insulin sensitivity but also
ALT levels and histological markers of NASH in overweight
subjects with non-alcoholic fatty liver.15 In vitro, PPAR-c
plays a significant role in the transcriptional activation of the
adiponectin gene.16 Therefore, the reported beneficial effect of
rosiglitazone in patients with NASH may be due in part to
the increasing effects of thiazolidinedione on adiponectin
expression.15 16
In conclusion, we have demonstrated significantly
decreased adiponectin and adipoRII expression in liver
biopsies of patients with NASH, suggesting that the func￾tional pathway of this important adipokine and its liver
specific receptor might be impaired in NASH.

Clinical Evidence is a regularly updated evidence-based journal available worldwide both as
a paper version and on the internet. Clinical Evidence needs to recruit a number of new
contributors. Contributors are healthcare professionals or epidemiologists with experience in
evidence-based medicine and the ability to write in a concise and structured way.
Areas for which we are currently seeking authors:
N Child health: nocturnal enuresis
N Eye disorders: bacterial conjunctivitis
N Male health: prostate cancer (metastatic)
N Women’s health: pre-menstrual syndrome; pyelonephritis in non-pregnant women
However, we are always looking for others, so do not let this list discourage you.
Being a contributor involves:
N Selecting from a validated, screened search (performed by in-house Information
Specialists) epidemiologically sound studies for inclusion.
N Documenting your decisions about which studies to include on an inclusion and exclusion
form, which we keep on file.
N Writing the text to a highly structured template (about 1500–3000 words), using evidence
from the final studies chosen, within 8–10 weeks of receiving the literature search.
N Working with Clinical Evidence editors to ensure that the final text meets epidemiological
and style standards.
N Updating the text every six months using any new, sound evidence that becomes available.
The Clinical Evidence in-house team will conduct the searches for contributors; your task is
simply to filter out high quality studies and incorporate them in the existing text.
N To expand the topic to include a new question about once every 12–18 months.
If you would like to become a contributor for Clinical Evidence or require more information
about what this involves please send your contact details and a copy of your CV, clearly
stating the clinical area you are interested in, to Klara Brunnhuber (kbrunnhuber@
bmjgroup.com).
Call for peer reviewers
Clinical Evidence also needs to recruit a number of new peer reviewers specifically with an
interest in the clinical areas stated above, and also others related to general practice. Peer
reviewers are healthcare professionals or epidemiologists with experience in evidence-based
medicine. As a peer reviewer you would be asked for your views on the clinical relevance,
validity, and accessibility of specific topics within the journal, and their usefulness to the
intended audience (international generalists and healthcare professionals, possibly with
limited statistical knowledge). Topics are usually 1500–3000 words in length and we would
ask you to review between 2–5 topics per year. The peer review process takes place
throughout the year, and our turnaround time for each review is ideally 10–14 days.
If you are interested in becoming a peer reviewer for Clinical Evidence, please
complete the peer review questionnaire at www.clinicalevidence.com or contact Klara
Brunnhuber (kbrunnhuber@bmjgroup.com).
