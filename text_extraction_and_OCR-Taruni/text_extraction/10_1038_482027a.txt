Last September, the United Nations 
declared that, for the first time in 
human history, chronic non-commu￾nicable diseases such as heart disease, cancer 
and diabetes pose a greater health burden 
worldwide than do infectious diseases, 
contributing to 35 million deaths annually.
This is not just a problem of the developed 
world. Every country that has adopted the 
Western diet — one dominated by low-cost, 
highly processed food — has witnessed rising 
rates of obesity and related diseases. There 
are now 30% more people who are obese 
than who are undernourished. Economic 
development means that the populations 
of low- and middle-income countries 
are living longer, and therefore are more

to 40% of normal-weight people develop 
the diseases that constitute the metabolic 
syndrome: diabetes, hypertension, lipid 
problems, cardiovascular disease and
non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Obesity 
is not the cause; rather, it is a marker for 
metabolic dysfunction, which is even more 
prevalent.

alcohol and diet as the central risk factors

complicated — food is required, whereas 
tobacco and alcohol are non-essential con￾sumables. The key question is: what aspects 
of the Western diet should be the focus of 
intervention? 
In October 2011, Denmark chose to tax 
foods high in saturated fat, despite the fact 
that most medical professionals no longer 
believe that fat is the primary culprit. But 
now, the country is considering taxing sugar 
as well — a more plausible and defensible 
step. Indeed, rather than focusing on fat and 
salt — the current dietary ‘bogeymen’ of the 
US Department of Agriculture (USDA) and 
the European Food Safety Authority — we 
believe that attention should be turned to 
‘added sugar’, defined as any sweetener con￾taining the molecule fructose that is added 
to food in processing. 
Over the past 50 years, consumption of 
sugar has tripled worldwide. In the United 
States, there is fierce controversy over the 
pervasive use of one particular added sugar 
— high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS). It is 
manufactured from corn syrup (glucose), 
processed to yield a roughly equal mixture of 
glucose and fructose. Most other developed 
countries eschew HFCS, relying on natu￾rally occurring sucrose as an added sugar, 
which also consists of equal parts glucose 
and fructose. 
Authorities consider sugar as ‘empty 
calories’ — but there is nothing empty about 
these calories. A growing body of scientific 
evidence is showing that fructose can trig￾ger processes that lead to liver toxicity and 
a host of other chronic diseases1
. A little is 
not a problem, but a lot kills—slowly (see 
‘Deadly effect’). If international bodies are 
truly concerned about public health, they 
must consider limiting fructose — and its 
main delivery vehicles, the added sugars 
HFCS and sucrose — which pose dangers 
to individuals and to society as a whole. 
NO ORDINARY COMMODITY
In 2003, social psychologist Thomas Babor 
and his colleagues published a landmark 
book called Alcohol: No Ordinary Commod￾ity, in which they established four criteria, 
now largely accepted by the public-health 
community, that justify the regulation of 
alcohol — unavoidability (or pervasiveness 
throughout society), toxicity, potential for 
abuse and negative impact on society2
. Sugar 
meets the same criteria, and we believe that 
it similarly warrants some form of societal 
intervention. 
First, consider unavoidability. Evolution￾arily, sugar was available to our ancestors as 
fruit for only a few months a year (at har￾vest time), or as honey, which was guarded 
by bees. But in recent years, sugar has been 
added to nearly all processed foods, limiting 
consumer choice3
. Nature made sugar hard 
to get; man made it easy. In many parts of the 
world, people are consuming an average of 
more than 500 calories per day from added 
sugar alone (see ‘The global sugar glut’). 
Now, let’s consider toxicity. A growing 
body of epidemiological and mechanistic 
evidence argues that excessive sugar con￾sumption affects human health beyond 
simply adding calories4
. Importantly, sugar 
induces all of the diseases associated with 
metabolic syndrome1,5. This includes: hyper￾tension (fructose increases uric acid, which 
raises blood pressure); high triglycerides 
and insulin resistance through synthesis of 
fat in the liver; diabetes from increased liver 
glucose production 
combined with insu￾lin resistance; and 
the ageing process, 
caused by damage to 
lipids, proteins and 
DNA through non￾enzymatic binding 
of fructose to these 
molecules. It can also 
be argued that fructose exerts toxic effects 
on the liver that are similar to those of alco￾hol1
. This is no surprise, because alcohol 
is derived from the fermentation of sugar. 
Some early studies have also linked sugar 
consumption to human cancer and cogni￾tive decline. 
Sugar also has clear potential for abuse. 
Like tobacco and alcohol, it acts on the 
brain to encourage subsequent intake. 
There are now numerous studies examin￾ing the dependence-producing properties 
of sugar in humans6
. Specifically, sugar 
dampens the suppression of the hormone 
ghrelin, which signals hunger to the brain. 
It also interferes with the normal transport 
and signalling of the hormone leptin, which 
helps to produce the feeling of satiety. And 
it reduces dopamine signalling in the brain’s 
reward centre, thereby decreasing the pleas￾ure derived from food and compelling 
the individual to consume more1,6. 
Finally, consider the negative effects of 
sugar on society. Passive smoking and drink￾driving fatalities provided strong arguments 
for tobacco and alcohol control, respec￾tively. The long-term economic, health-care 
and human costs of metabolic syndrome 
place sugar overconsumption in the same 
category7
. The United States spends $65 bill￾ion in lost productivity and $150 billion on 
health-care resources annually for morbidi￾ties associated with metabolic syndrome. 
Seventy-five per cent of all US health-care 
dollars are now spent on treating these dis￾eases and their resultant disabilities. Because 
about 25% of military applicants are now 
rejected for obesity-related reasons, the past 
three US surgeons general and the chairman 
of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff have declared 
obesity a “threat to national security”. 
HOW TO INTERVENE
How can we reduce sugar consumption? 
After all, sugar is natural. Sugar is a nutrient. 
Sugar is pleasure. So too is alcohol, but in 
both cases, too much of a good thing is toxic. 
It may be helpful to look to the many genera￾tions of international experience with alcohol 
and tobacco to find models that work8,9. So 
far, evidence shows that individually focused 
approaches, such as school-based interven￾tions that teach children about diet and exer￾cise, demonstrate little efficacy. Conversely, 
for both alcohol and tobacco, there is robust 
evidence that gentle ‘supply side’ control 
strategies which stop far short of all-out pro￾hibition — taxation, distribution controls, 
age limits — lower both consumption of the 
product and the accompanying health harms. 
Successful interventions share a common 
end-point: curbing availability2,8,9.
Taxing alcohol and tobacco products 
— in the form of special excise duties, 
value-added taxes and sales taxes — are 
the most popular and effective ways to

reduce smoking and drinking, and in 
turn, substance abuse and related harms2
. 
Consequently, we propose adding taxes to 
processed foods that contain any form of 
added sugars. This would include sweetened 
fizzy drinks (soda), other sugar-sweetened 
beverages (for example, juice, sports drinks 
and chocolate milk) and sugared cereal. 
Already, Canada and some European coun￾tries impose small additional taxes on some 
sweetened foods. The United States is cur￾rently considering a penny-per-ounce soda 
tax (about 34 cents per litre), which would 
raise the price of a can by 10–12 cents. Cur￾rently, a US citizen consumes an average 
of 216 litres of soda per year, of which 58% 
contains sugar. Taxing at a penny an ounce 
could provide annual revenue in excess of 
$45 per capita (roughly $14 billion per year); 
however, this would be unlikely to reduce 
total consumption. Statistical modelling 
suggests that the price would have to double 
to significantly reduce soda consumption — 
so a $1 can should cost $2 (ref. 10).
Other successful tobacco- and alcohol￾control strategies limit availability, such as 
reducing the hours that retailers are open, 
controlling the location and density of retail 
markets and limiting who can legally pur￾chase the products2,9. A reasonable parallel 
for sugar would tighten licensing require￾ments on vending machines and snack bars 
that sell sugary products in schools and 
workplaces. Many schools have removed 
unhealthy fizzy drinks and candy from 
vending machines, but often replaced them 
with juice and sports drinks, which also 
contain added sugar. States could apply 
zoning ordinances to control the number 
of fast-food outlets and convenience stores 
in low-income communities, and especially 
around schools, while providing incentives 
for the establishment of grocery stores and 
farmer’s markets. 
Another option would be to limit sales 
during school operation, or to designate 
an age limit (such as 17) for the purchase of 
drinks with added sugar, particularly soda. 
Indeed, parents in South Philadelphia, Penn￾sylvania, recently took this upon themselves 
by lining up outside convenience stores and 
blocking children from entering them after 
school. Why couldn’t a public-health direc￾tive do the same? 
THE POSSIBLE DREAM
Government-imposed regulations on 
the marketing of alcohol to young people 
have been quite effective, but there is no such 
approach to sugar-laden products. Even so, 
the city of San Francisco, California, recently 
banned the inclusion of toys with unhealthy 
meals such as some types of fast food. A limit 
— or, ideally, ban — on television commer￾cials for products with added sugars could 
further protect children’s health. 
Reduced fructose consumption could 
also be fostered through changes in sub￾sidization. Promotion of healthy foods in 
US low-income programmes, such as the 
Special Supplemental Nutrition Program 
for Women, Infants and Children and the 
Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Pro￾gram (also known as the food-stamps 
programme) is an obvious place to start. 
Unfortunately, the petition by New York City 
to remove soft drinks from the food-stamp 
programme was denied by the USDA.
Ultimately, food producers and distribu￾tors must reduce the amount of sugar added 
to foods. But sugar is cheap, sugar tastes 
good and sugar sells, so companies have 
little incentive to change. Although one 
institution alone can’t turn this juggernaut 
around, the US Food and Drug Adminis￾tration could “set the table” for change8
. 
To start, it should consider removing fruc￾tose from the Generally Regarded as Safe 
(GRAS) list, which allows food manufactur￾ers to add unlimited amounts to any food. 
Opponents will argue that other nutrients 
on the GRAS list, such as iron and vitamins 
A and D, can also be toxic when over-con￾sumed. However, unlike sugar, these sub￾stances have no abuse potential. Removal 
from the GRAS list would send a powerful 
signal to the European Food Safety Author￾ity and the rest of the world. 
Regulating sugar will not be easy — 
particularly in the ‘emerging markets’ of 
developing countries where soft drinks 
are often cheaper than potable water or 
milk. We recognize that societal interven￾tion to reduce the supply and demand for 
sugar faces an uphill political battle against 
a powerful sugar lobby, and will require 
active engagement from all stakeholders. 
Still, the food industry knows that it has a 
problem — even vigorous lobbying by fast￾food companies couldn’t defeat the toy ban 
in San Francisco. With enough clamour for 
change, tectonic shifts in policy become pos￾sible. Take, for instance, bans on smoking in 
public places and the use of designated driv￾ers, not to mention airbags in cars and con￾dom dispensers in public bathrooms. These 
simple measures — which have all been on 
the battleground of American politics — are 
now taken for granted as essential tools for 
our public health and well-being. It’s time to 
turn our attention to sugar. ■
