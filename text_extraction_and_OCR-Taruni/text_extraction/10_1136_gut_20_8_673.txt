SUMMARY Collagenisation of the space of Disse was systematically assessed to determine its
relationship to the clinical and histological manifestations of chronic alcoholic liver disease. Ninety￾four chronic alcoholics who had been submitted to biopsy were assessed by clinical manifestations
of hepatic dysfunction and by a 17-parameter Combined Clinical and Laboratory Index (CCLI).
Liver biopsies were scored for light (LM) and electron-microscopy (EM) abnormalities using a
universal scoring system for both. Thirty-five patients with normal liver histology (LM) had an
average collagen score of 0-6±0 1. Twelve cirrhotic patients and 29 with fatty liver, both groups
with mild clinical manifestations, did not differ significantly. In 18 cirrhotic patients and five with
fatty liver, both groups having severe clinical manifestations, the mean scores were 21 ±0-8
(P <0-02) and 2 5 I0 6 (P <0-01) respectively. Collagenisation also correlated with CCLI
(P<0001), serum bilirubin (P<0001), serum aspartate transferase (SGOT) (P<0'003), and
clinical evidence of portal hypertension and histological changes of necrosis, inflammation, and
terminal hepatic vein sclerosis. These results suggest that collagenisation of the Disse space may be
important in the pathogenesis of alcoholic liver disease.
The hepatic perisinusoidal space of Disse separates
the endothelial lining cells of the hepatic sinusoids
from the plasma membrane of the hepatocytes and
constitutes the microenvironment from which ex￾change between the parenchymal cells and blood
takes place. Normally, electron microscopy reveals
either no collagen fibrils within the space, or
occasional bundles of up to 10 fibrils (Popper et al.,
1961). In the early lesions of alcoholic liver disease
these fibrils have been observed to be present in
increased numbers to form bundles of up to 100
fibrils which cause considerable widening of Disse's
space (Popper et al., 1961; Schaffner and Popper,
1963; Phillips and Steiner, 1965). In more advanced
alcoholic liver disease these thick collagen bundles
form a continuous layer which, together with the
formation of a basement membrane, may impede
the interchange between the blood and hepatocytes
and thus interfere with hepatic function (Schaffner
and Popper, 1963). Furthermore, the widened space

of Disse, by decreasing the sinusoidal diameter,
could increase the resistance to sinusoidal blood
flow and thus raise portal pressure (Reynolds et al.,
1969; Boyer et al., 1967; Kluge et al., 1970; Sama
et al., 1971).
However, the relationship between ultrastructural
changes in the space of Disse and the clinical
manifestations of alcoholic liver disease have never
been studied in a systematic way. We report here an
attempt to assess the significance of such changes.
Methods
SUBJECTS
Ninety-four chronic alcoholics, with a daily alcohol
consumption of more than 80 g for more than 10
years, were assessed clinically and biochemically for
evidences of liver disease. The following laboratory
tests were performed on each patient: serum
aspartate transferase (SGOT), serum gamma gluta￾myl transpeptidase (SGGTP), serum alkaline phos￾phatase, serum bilirubin, serum albumin, prothrom￾bin time, and haemogram. A liver biopsy was
performed on each patient.

Patients were divided according to the clinical,
laboratory, and histological findings in the following
way:
Normal
Thirty-five chronic alcoholic patients without clinical
or laboratory evidence of liver disease and with
normal liver histology on biopsy (LM);
With liver disease
This group of 59 patients was further subdivided
into two categories:
Group A Forty-one patients with a minimal
clinical manifestation of hepatomegaly and bio￾chemically with an increase in SGOT of up to 100 U
(normal 7-17 U) and SGGTP of up to 100 U
(normal up to 27 U);
Group B Eighteen patients with marked clinical
manifestations including spider naevi, palmar ery￾thema, evidence of collateral circulation, hepato￾megaly, jaundice and ascites; biochemical abnor￾malities included raised bilirubin levels, depressed
serum albumin concentrations, and grossly raised
liver enzyme levels. However, in all patients the
prothrombin time was prolonged less than three
seconds, permitting a liver biopsy.
The severity of the liver disease was assessed in
each patient by a composite clinical and laboratory
index (CCLI), based on the concept that the severity
of the disease is reflected by the number of abnormal
clinical and laboratory findings (Rankin et al., 1978).
These are added to give a final numerical score
ranging from 0-27. The index is made up of 17
separate clinical and biochemical findings, and its
validity has been discussed elsewhere (Orrego et al.,
1979).
TECHNIQUES
Transmission electron microscopy
Specimens studied by electron microscopy (EM)
were fixed in a combination of 4 % formaldehyde
and 1% glutaraldehyde (MacDowell and Trump,
1976).
Specimens were cut on a Porter Blum MT2 with
glass or diamond knives, stained with uranyl acetate
and lead citrate and examined with a Philips 301
electron microscope. Sections approximately 05,u
thick were stained with toluidine blue for lobular
localisation.
One of the most important methodological
problems that a study of this sort entails is the
possibility of sampling errors. This factor, which
has to be considered also in liver biopsies observed
under light microscopy (Scheuer, 1970), is greatly
amplified in electron microscopic studies where the
size of the zone observed is representative of a very
small part of the total organ. Therefore, we adhered
to certain criteria in an attempt to minimise this
possibility.
The following framework was used in order to
minimise the problem of sampling error and to
ensure objectivity in grading the observed abnor￾malities:
1. The specimens were examined and classified by
one of the authors (A.M.), who was blind to the
clinical classification of the patient.
2. In all specimens thick sections stained with
toluidine blue were observed for lobular localisation.
It is recognized that this involves the problem of a
certain degree of selection, and decreases the
randomisation that we would have preferred.
However, the 'blindness' of the pathologist with
respect to clinical data ensured that these areas were
not selected to fit a preconceived hypothesis.
Furthermore, in the case of cirrhosis, the scores
were compared only with other cirrhotics and not
with other patient groups. The area for analysis was
selected remote from portal triads and from scarred
areas in abnormal livers. Once the area was selected,
only the first four Disse spaces observed in the

selected specimen were photographed in their
entirety, from magnifications ranging from 1000 to
25 000. At least 20 photographs were taken from
each specimen. Irrespective of what might be seen in
the fifth Disse space, only the findings in the first
four observed on a random basis were graded
according to the devised scoring system.
3. A scoring system was devised to grade the
degree of change observed in the space of Disse
(Fig. 1). The items included in the system were the
degree of collagenisation of the space, the presence
or absence of basement membrane and/or the

presence of intercellular collagen. The maximum
cumulative score obtainable in this scale is 5-5.
Individual elements were graded as follows:
Collagenisation O+, when minimal or non-existent;
1 + or 2+ (Fig. 2), when appearing in bundles
widening the Disse space and flattening the microvilli
of the hepatocytes, and graded according to the
length of involvement of the space of Disse.
Formation of basal membranes As a continuous
electron-dense material with a clearly defined
structure separating the endothelial cells from the
hepatocytes. When this finding was present it was
assigned a score of 3+.
Collagen in intercellular space When present, 0 5 %
was added to the score.
When the above abnormalities were not diffuse, so
that parts of the Disse space appeared abnormal,
0 5+ was subtracted from the score.
4. Reproducibility In order to assess the degree
of reproducibility of the scoring of the sample, 10
micrographs were scored twice by the same patho￾logist using two different identification codes. The
reproducibility was excellent, in that in each biopsy
the first and second scores were identical.
Grading of light microscopy findings
Necrosis Severity was graded on a 1 + to 3 +
scale: 1+, hepatocellular necrosis in zone 3
(Rappaport, 1973) or erosion of the limiting plate;
2+, more severe changes, widespread hepatocellular
degeneration, some disorganisation of the liver cell
plates, secondary collapse; 3+, diffuse necrosis,
distortion of lobular organisation, confluent hepato￾cellular degeneration, and necrosis completely
surrounding the hepatic acini.
Fibrosis (portal) 1+, expanded portal triads with
increased connective tissue; 2+, fibrosis extending
into the lobule, but not bridging portal triads with
terminal hepatic venules; 3+, fibrosis bridging
portal triads and terminal hepatic venules.
Inflammation 1+, zonal localisation; 2+, mod￾erate, not confined to one zone of the acinus; 3+,
diffuse.
Mallory bodies 1+, less than 10% of the hepato￾cytes contain Mallory bodies; 2+, more than 10%
but less than 25% of hepatocytes contain Mallory
bodies; 3+, more than 25% of liver cells contain
Mallory bodies.
Fat 1+, less than 25% of the cells contain fat
droplets; 2+, 25% to 50% of cells contain fat; 3+,
over 50% of cells contain fat droplets.
Terminal hepatic vein (THV) sclerosis 1+, a rim of
fibrous tissue around THV; 2+, extensive fibrosis
around THV, lumen of vein still present; 3+,
extensive fibrosis, lumen of vein obliterated. The
total score was then divided by the number of THV
observed in the liver biopsy and an average score
was obtained.
Statistics Data are expressed as means ±standard
error. When groups were compared, Student's
t test was used. Analyses of correlations were
performed using a special computer programme
(SPSS). As values for some of the laboratory tests
(serum enzymes) were not normally distributed,
logarithmic conversion of these results was carried
out before statistical calculations.
Results
Of the 41 patients classified clinically as mild (group
A), 29 had fatty liver and 12 cirrhosis with and
without hepatitis on histology. Of the 18 patients
classified clinically as severe (group B), 13 had
cirrhosis with and without hepatitis and five had
fatty liver on histology (Table 1).
The mean scores for the changes in the space of
Disse of patients in group A, irrespective of whether
they had fatty liver or cirrhosis on biopsy, were not
significantly different from those of the normal
group (Table 1). In contrast, the 13 patients in
clinical group B with cirrhosis with or without
hepatitis on biopsy had a mean EM collagen score
that was significantly different not only from normal
patients and group A patients with fatty liver

who had only fatty liver on histology, but who
presented moderate ascites, had a mean EM collagen
score that was significantly different from the 29
patients with fatty liver in clinical group A (Table 1).
The 94 patients were divided into two groups on the
basis of the degree of collagen found in Disse's
space. Those with collagen scores of 0-24 (N=76)
had a mean CCLI score of 2-2±0-4, while those
with collagen scores of 2-5 or more (N= 18), had a
mean CCLI of 10-0 +4-2. The difference in collagen
scores was highly significant (P <0001). Further￾more, there was a significant positive correlation
between the EM collagen score and the CCLI when
compared in all 94 patients in the series (Fig. 3).
Finally, the relation between the EM collagen
score and the clinical manifestations of portal
hypertension was assessed by comparing the groups
with high and low EM collagen scores, divided again
at the 2 5 mark, with respect to the presence or
absence of ascites and/or splenomegaly and/or
evidence of collaterals. There was no clinical
evidence of portal hypertension in over 97-6% of
patients with no, or minimal, collagen deposition,
whereas 8333% of patients with high EM collagen
scores had evidence of portal hypertension, this
association being statistically highly significant
(Table 2).
Collagen in Disse's space was found to be
correlated positively with the serum bilirubin
(p < 0-001) and SGOT (p < 0-003) levels, but not
with alkaline phosphatase or albumin. Among the
histological findings on light microscopy, necrosis
(p < 0 002), inflammation (p < 0 003) and terminal
hepatic vein sclerosis (p < 0 002) correlated positively
with Disse space collagen. On the other hand, no
correlation was found with fibrosis as detected on
light microscopy, with fat accumulation or with the
presence of Mallory bodies (Table 3).
Discussion
The results in this study have shown highly significant
correlations between the degree of collagenisation
and capillarisation of the space of Disse and the
severity of clinical manifestations and biochemical

changes associated with hepatic dysfunction in
alcoholic liver disease. Before discussing the impor￾tance of these findings it is necessary to examine the
significance of the data itself.
Information obtained from microscopic examina￾tion suffers from the handicap of being 'soft', in that
it depends entirely on the criteria of the observer as
compared with the instrumental result of a bio￾chemist. Nevertheless, within the limits of such an
investigation, by laying down as rigid criteria as
possible for scoring, by adhering to them throughout
the study, and by using the same observer, one can
minimise this source of error as seen by the excellent
reproducibility found when the same samples were
scored again for EM collagen. In addition, such an
investigation also encounters the problem of
sampling, which is exaggerated in an EM study by
the smallness of the sample examined. This is
minimised in diffuse liver disease by the similarity of
the changes throughout the liver. It is maximum in
the cirrhotic liver because of the differences that
occur depending on whether the sample is in the
middle or edge of a regeneration nodule or whether
it is close to a portal tract or central vein. Again, an
attempt was made to minimise the sampling prob￾lem by first attempting to analyse similar sites in the
lobule in each specimen, secondly by grading only
the first four spaces of Disse observed at random,
and thirdly by the 'blindness' of the observer to the
clinical conditions of the patients.
With these reservations in mind, it would be
extremely unlikely that by chance all the samples
from cirrhotics in clinical group A would be chosen
from areas with minimum EM lesions, while all
those from group B would be chosen from areas
with marked EM lesions.
On the other side of the equation is the problem
of clinically assessing hepatic function. In this study
we have used two methods. One consisted of
dividing our patients into two groups, one mild with
only hepatomegaly as commonly found in fatty
liver, and the other moderate or severe with many of
the other clinical and biochemical manifestations
such as spider naevi, palmar erythema, ascites and
jaundice, plus abnormal bilirubin, albumin, and
enzyme levels. The second method was a combina￾tion of both clinical and biochemical abnormalities,
which gives a 17-factor index. In a previous study
this combined clinical and laboratory index was
found to be a good monitor of acute changes in
hepatic function and to be statistically better than
any single parameter used in the index (Rankin
et al., 1978).
It is of interest, therefore, that assessing the
patients by both methods produced the same result￾namely, that a deterioration in function was asso￾ciated with increased changes in Disse's space.
Previous studies have drawn attention to these
changes and have suggested that they are early
indications of alcoholic liver disease (Popper et al.,
1961; Schaffner and Popper, 1963; Phillips and
Staines, 1965; Reynolds et al., 1969; Edmondson
et al., 1967). By studying a large group of patients
systematically we have been able to show that, on
the contrary, in patients who show no clinical,
biochemical, or histological light-microscopy evi￾dence of liver damage after drinking heavily for
more than 10 years, the so-called 'normal' group,
there were no EM abnormalities in the Disse space.
Furthermore, significant collagenisation occurred
only with gross clinical and biochemical evidence of
liver dysfunction. A good example of this are the
five patients with fatty liver who presented clinically
with moderate ascites. Collagenisation of the Disse
space was as marked in these patients as in the
cirrhotics with evidence of portal hypertension.
Ascites in association with fatty liver is uncommon,
but it is well described (Rankin et al., 1978), although
the mechanism has not been clarified. On the other
hand, cirrhotics in group A with minimal clinical
abnormalities had the same lack of collagen in the
Disse space in the zone observed as did alcoholics
with biopsies showing normal livers. Also, the
positive correlation found between collagen in the
Disse space and serum bilirubin and SGOT levels,
and with necrosis and inflammation on histology,
points to an association of this lesion with activity of
the liver disease.
The low correlation coefficients (r) found in all of
these correlations is consistent with the possibility
that both changes in severity of liver disease and in
histology reflect a multifactorial pathogenesis, of
which the abnormalities in the space of Disse are
only one factor.
What is the significance of these observations?
The Disse space is a highly specialised lymphatic
vascular bed characterised by an absence of a
basement membrane, and by fenestrations in the
endothelial lining through which the microvilli of
the plasma membrane of the hepatocyte can project
into the lumen (Layden et al., 1975; Jones and
Schmucker, 1977). Thus, in this micro-environment
the absorptive surface of the hepatocyte is uniquely
exposed to the circulation, which facilitates the
transfer of plasma constituents and of oxygen into
the hepatocyte. With collagenisation of the space and
the interposition of a basement membrane it is to be
expected that this process would be hindered and
hepatic function impaired (Schaffner and Popper,
1963; Phillips and Steiner, 1965; Tanikawa, 1975).
For example, it has been shown that hypoxia in
chronically alcohol-treated rats can lead to liver cell

necrosis (Israel et al., 1977). Thus, interference with
oxygen diffusion from the sinusoids into the liver
cells could additionally contribute to liver cell
necrosis in the alcoholic.
Furthermore, a diminution of the sinusoidal
diameter caused by widening of the Disse space
could result in an increase in portal pressure (Sama
et al., 1971). It has been postulated that this mecha￾nism is responsible for the portal hypertension
found in idiopathic portal hypertension (Boyer et al.,
1967; Kluge et al., 1970; Sama et al., 1971). Alter￾natively, these EM changes may simply be a con￾sequence of prolonged hepatic dysfunction and
increased sinusoidal pressure due to, for example,
an increase in the size of the hepatocytes. Whatever
the mechanism, the findings in this study would seem
to be important in the understanding of the patho￾genesis of hepatic dysfunction and portal hyper￾tension in alcoholic liver disease.
