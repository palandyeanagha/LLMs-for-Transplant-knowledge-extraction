Backgrounds/Aims: Acute appendicitis is one of the most common emergent disease in the general population requiring 
surgical treatment. However, only a few cases of appendicitis after liver transplantation (LT) were reported. We de￾scribed experiences of acute appendicitis after LT in single center. Methods: From March 1988 to July 2019, we re￾viewed retrospectively all the patients who diagnosed with acute appendicitis after LT at the Seoul National University 
Hospital. We described and analyzed clinical outcomes of appendectomy after LT. Results: A total of 12 patients out 
of 2,237 LT patients underwent appendectomy due to acute appendicitis. The mean age was 48±12 years. Nine pa￾tients (75%) underwent deceased donor liver transplantation (DDLT) and three patients (25%) underwent living donor 
liver transplantation (LDLT). The mean days from transplantation to the onset of acute appendicitis was 739 (range 
57-4,496) days. Every patients underwent appropriate appendectomy within 1 days after visiting hospital. Leukocytosis 
was seen in three patients (25%). Seven patients (58%) underwent laparoscopic appendectomy and five patients (42%) 
underwent open appendectomy. The total operative time was 47.5 (range 25–135) minutes. The median postoperative 
hospitalization was 4 (range 2-11) days. There was no postoperative complications documented. There was no sig￾nificant difference of clinical outcomes between laparoscopic appendectomy group and open appendectomy group. 
Conclusions: Early surgical management achieved satisfactory postoperative results without graft dysfunction after LT. 
Laparoscopic appendectomy also could be applicable with safe and feasible outcomes even in post-LT recipients. (Ann

INTRODUCTION
Acute appendicitis is one of the most frequent emergent 
disease requiring surgical treatment. However, reports on 
acute appendicitis in liver transplantation (LT) recipient 
remains scanty.
The increasing number of liver transplantation and im￾provement in survival rate also increases the incidence of 
various intra-abdominal surgical emergencies.1-4
The diagnosis and management of acute appendicitis in 
transplanted patients follow the principles of any surgical 
emergencies. However, compared to the general popula￾tion, the fact that transplanted patients are always in an 
immunosuppressive state should always in considered. Pre￾vious studies have reported that acute appendicitis after 
LT may present different clinical courses and thus, may 
result in more perioperative complications. Therefore, ear￾ly diagnosis and surgery is crucial in managing LT pa￾tients with long-term immunosuppressive therapy.3-6
An open approach is usually recommended in abdomi￾nal emergencies in post-transplant patients. However, with 
the advancement of instruments and improvement in sur￾geons' skills, laparoscopic approach has recently per￾formed and showed to be feasible.2,4,7,8 In this study, we 
report a single center experience acute appendicitis after 
liver transplantation.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data from March 1988 to July 2019, we reviewed ret￾rospectively all the patients who diagnosed with acute ap￾pendicitis after LT at the Seoul National University Hos￾pital. Total 2,237 cases of LT were formed at the SNUH. 
1,551 patients underwent living donor liver transplantation 
(LDLT) and the other 686 patients underwent deceased 
donor liver transplantation (DDLT). Total 12 patients di￾agnosed with acute appendicitis after LT were selected. 
Clinical variables including gender, age at transplantation 
and appendectomy, presenting signs and symptoms, diag￾nostic evaluations including white blood cell counts and 
radiology, time to treatment after symptom presentation, 
surgical methods (laparoscopy versus open surgery), intra￾operative findings, intraoperative and postoperative com￾plications, pathological results, postoperative hospital stay 
and follow-up was collected for analysis.
This study was approved by the Institutional Review 
Board (IRB) of the Seoul National University Hospital 
(IRB no. 1909-140-1066) which waived the need for in￾formed consent. 
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 
25.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). Continuous data 
were compared using the Mann-Whitney U-test and cate￾gorical data were compared by using the chi-square test 
or Fisher’s exact test. Unpaired t-test was performed to 
compare the operation time and postoperative hospital￾ization days between open and laparoscopic append￾ectomy. p＜0.05 was considered statistically significant.
RESULTS
Demographics
The clinical characteristics of the 12 patients who un￾derwent appendectomy are presented in Table 1. A total 
of 2,237 LTs were performed from March 1988 to July 
2019. 12 patients underwent appendectomy due to acute 
appendicitis. The mean age of these patients upon pre￾sentation was 48±12 years. The mean age at liver trans￾plantation of the patients who underwent appendectomy 
was 45±11 years. There were seven (58%) male patients 
and five (42%) female patients. Nine (75%) patients un￾derwent DDLT and three (25%) patients underwent LDLT. 
The median days from transplantation to the diagnosis of 
appendicitis were 739 days (range 57-4,496 days) (Table 2). 
The median follow-up periods after appendectomy were 
1,712 days (range 83-6,566 days).
Presentation and diagnostic evaluation
All of the 12 patients had preoperative symptoms, in￾cluding nausea, vomiting, abdominal discomfort, and fever. 
Local tenderness on the RLQ was observed in all 12 
patients. Leukocytosis defined as white blood cell (WBC) 
counts exceeding 10,000/µL was only seen in three (25%) 
patients. All patients underwent abdominal computed to￾mography (CT) scan to confirm the diagnosis (Tables 1, 2).
Surgery
All patients were underwent appendectomy within the 
median of one day (range 1-3 days) after symptom pre￾sentation. Although the open approach is considered safer 
in post-transplant patients, seven (58%) patients at the 
SNUH underwent laparoscopic compared to the open count￾erpart (n=5, 42%). The median operative time was 47.5 
minutes (range 25–135 minutes). The mean operative time 
was 42±16 minutes in open group and 64±37.5 minutes 
in laparoscopic appendectomy, but it was not significant 
different between the two groups (p＞0.05). Intra-abdomi￾nal drain was placed in seven (58%) patients during sur￾gery (Tables 1, 2). 
Hospital course and outcome
The median postoperative length of stay was four days 
(range 2-11 days) with no surgery-related complications 
and mortality. The postoperative hospitalized was 4±2 days 
and 5±3 days in the open and laparoscopic appendectomy 
respectively. There was no significant difference between 
the two groups (p＞0.05). Three patients died during long￾term follow-up due to recurrence of the primary liver dis￾ease. The long-term survival after appendectomy was 75% 
(Table 3).
Pathological findings
Postoperative pathology results showed a high percent￾age of acute suppurative appendicitis (n=8, 66.7%). There 
were three (25%) cases of periappendiceal abscess and 
one (8.2%) case of perforation. Acute gangrenous appen-

dicitis and acute appendicitis were seen in one patient 
each (8.3%). Unusually, one patient had metastatic hep￾atocellular carcinoma (HCC) in pathologic result of ap￾pendix and died due to disease progression. In addition, 
one patient was diagnosed with low-grade appendiceal 
mucinous neoplasm (Tables 1, 2).
DISCUSSION
The number of LT and long-term survival has been in￾creasing and improving accompanied by improved surgi￾cal techniques and immunosuppressant. In the last decade, 
the number of LT has increased exponentially in South 
Korea. Since the first LT performed in 1988, more than 
10,000 cases of LT have been performed in 40 different 

48 Ann Hepatobiliary Pancreat Surg Vol. 24, No. 1, February 2020 www.ahbps.org
centers.6,9,10 With increasing numbers of LT recipients, 
surgeons should be more cautious in assessing and manag￾ing both medical and surgical non-graft related diseases 
including acute appendicitis.
Acute appendicitis is one of the most common emer￾gent diseases requiring surgical treatment.10 However, on￾ly few case studies on acute appendicitis in LT recipients 
have been reported. In this study, 12 patients who under￾went LT diagnosed with acute appendicitis were analyzed. 
This is the largest study on acute appendicitis in LT pa￾tients to date. Previous studies regarding this subject are 
reported as case reviews or series. Although Savar et al.6
reported 12 patients in organ transplant recipients diag￾nosed with acute appendicitis, this study only included 
seven LT recipients. Furthermore, de'Angelis et al.10 per￾formed a systematic review of 39 case series which pro￾vided data from mixed abdominal non-graft related emer￾gencies in solid organ transplantation patients. In addition, 
other studies on acute appendicitis in post-LT patients are 
mostly case reviews or include less than ten cases (Table 
4).1-5,11-15
The reported accumulative incidence of acute appendi￾citis after LT in recent studies showed to be less than 
0.5%.1-4,10 Some report addressed that the incidence of 
acute appendicitis in LT recipients as 0.09% and 0.2% 
respectively.5,6 Similar to the reported and generally ac￾cepted incidence, the rate of acute appendicitis in LT pa￾tients at the SNUH was 0.5% (n=12). 
In this study, LT patients diagnosed with acute appen￾dicitis presented with similar symptoms of acute appendi￾citis as the general population. The most prominent symp￾tom and sign was abdominal discomfort and pain with lo￾cal tenderness at the right lower quadrant (RLQ). All 12 
patients showed signs of inflammation at the RLQ. 
Leukocytosis defined as WBC counts exceeding 10,000/ 
µL was shown in the majority of their patients in previous 
studies.5,7 However, Leukocytosis as only observed in 
25% of the patients in this study but increased proportion 
of segmented neutrophil count was observed in almost all 
cases. This might be related with long-term use of im￾munosuppressant that sometimes cause leukopenia in 
post-LT patients. In addition, four out of the twelve pa￾tients in this series was on combined immunosuppressant 
therapy with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), which is an 
anti-proliferative drug, at the time of the appendectomy.

This manifestation is similar with neutropenic enter￾ocolitis in immunocompromised patients.17 LT patients 
presenting signs and symptoms of acute appendicitis can 
be mistaken as other graft-related complications of misled 
by other gastrointestinal disease due to immunosuppres￾sion. This can lead to delayed diagnosis or even mis￾diagnosis and consequently delay treatment. Thus, high 
index of suspicion is always required. Therefore, radio￾logical diagnosis in highly suspicious patients is highly 
recommended. In most clinical settings, computed tomog￾raphy (CT) is considered more sensitive and specific in 
diagnosis acute appendicitis compared to ultrasonography. 
The sensitivity and specificity of CT scans are 90% and 
91% respectively in the diagnosis of acute appendici￾tis.16,18 All 12 patients in this study underwent CT scans 
and showed appendiceal inflammation and wall thickening 
suggestive of acute appendicitis. 
Recently, antibiotics as a non-operative treatment has 
been popularized in the selected patients in the general 
population with a 38% risk of recurrence. However, ag￾gressive management is preferred and recommended to 
minimize morbidity due to the chronic immunosuppressed 
status of LT patients.16 Early surgical management per￾formed within one to three days after onset of acute ap￾pendicitis provided the best results. Appendiceal perfo￾ration generally occurs within 48-72 hours and even ear￾lier in immunocompromised patients.19 In this study, all 
12 patients promptly underwent appendectomy, generally 
within one day after symptom presentation.
The advantages of the laparoscopic approach are less 
postoperative pain, shorter hospital stay, and better quality 
of life in the early and late postoperative period making 
it a popular choice of approach for patients and surgeons. 
However, open surgery has been strongly recommended 
in various abdominal emergencies in LT patients due the 
possibility of graft-related emergencies and the risk of 
adhesions.10 The main concerns of laparoscopic surgery in 
patients with previous intra-abdominal surgeries is access￾ing the abdominal cavity without causing other vascular 
or organ injuries since appropriate surgical fields may not 
be obtained due to unpredictable adhesions. However, 
with the advancement of laparoscopic instruments and im￾proved surgeon’s surgical skills and knowledge, laparo￾scopic surgery has become safer and more feasible in pa￾tients who underwent previous abdominal surgeries.7,8
This also includes patients who underwent solid organ 
transplantations. For instance, safe access to the abdomi￾nal cavity can be gained by utilizing the Hasson open 
technique for the first trocar that can provide safe access 
for additional trocars.8
The proportion of laparoscopic appendectomy in LT re￾cipients is recently increased. As mentioned previously, 
earlier studies report on acute appendicitis managed in the 
open approach (Table 4). In 2012, Quartey et al.4
 reported 
the first laparoscopic appendectomy case in a LT patient. 
Followed by this report, Wei et al.15 reported two cases 
of laparoscopic appendectomy in a liver and kidney trans￾plant recipients. Laparoscopic appendectomy was common 
in our study accounting for approximately 60% especially 
after 2015. There was only one case of open appendec￾tomy after 2015 in which that patient received two lapa￾rotomies prior to appendectomy and thus, warranting the 
open approach due to safety issues.
This study includes the largest series of laparoscopic 
appendectomy in LT recipients. There was no intra or 
postoperative complications observed or documented. 
Furthermore, there was no significant difference in the op￾eration time and postoperative hospitalization days be￾tween open and laparoscopic appendectomy (p＞0.05). 
Therefore, laparoscopic appendectomy can be considered 
safe and can be a better choice in selected patients. The 
placement of intra-abdominal drains in patients under￾going appendectomy has always been controversial. How￾ever, in cases with perforation or formation of periappen￾diceal abscesses, drain placements are recommended.
Most pathological findings were acute suppurative ap￾pendicitis, there was a single case of perforation. The pa￾tient was admitted to the emergency department with sep￾tic shock and during the operation, intra-abdominal spill￾age and contamination was observed. There was no post￾operative complication and the patient was discharged af￾ter seven days (Case 6). Although periappendiceal abscess 
formation is reported to be rare in transplant recipients,15
there were three cases of abscess formation. All three pa￾tients underwent laparoscopic appendectomy and were 
discharged without complications. Moreover, there was one 
patient diagnosed with HCC metastasis (Case 5). There 
was no postoperative complication and was discharged on 
postoperative day four. However, the patient died due to 
the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma.

50 Ann Hepatobiliary Pancreat Surg Vol. 24, No. 1, February 2020 www.ahbps.org
One of the interesting findings in this study is that one 
patient was diagnosed with low-grade appendiceal muci￾nous neoplasm (Case 9). There has been no report on ap￾pendiceal mucinous neoplasm diagnosed in a LT patient. 
The patient presented with abdominal discomfort accom￾panied by fever, general weakness, nausea, vomiting and 
diarrhea. Upon admission to the emergency department, 
CT scans were taken and showed appendiceal distension 
with mild wall thickening. The patient was diagnosed with 
acute appendicitis and underwent laparoscopic appendect￾omy. During the surgery, a mildly edematous appendix 
without further complications was observed. However, the 
patient was diagnosed with appendiceal mucinous neo￾plasm on the final pathologic report. The patient was dis￾charged on postoperative day 11 with the longest post￾operative hospitalization but without any complications 
during postoperative care.
The median postoperative length of stay was four days 
with no postoperative complications and mortality. There 
was no acute graft rejection or failure observed in these 
patients. All of our patients recovered well with proper 
liver function and no sign of acute rejection.
In conclusion, with increased number of liver trans￾plantation and overall survival of these patients, the in￾cidence of acute appendicitis in post-LT patients is inc￾reasing. Surgeons must be more cautious in recognizing, 
making a diagnosis and treating acute appendicitis in LT 
recipients. The incidence of appendicitis in post-LT pa￾tients is up to 0.5%. Laparoscopic appendectomy can be 
performed safely for treatment of acute appendicitis in 
post-LT patients.
