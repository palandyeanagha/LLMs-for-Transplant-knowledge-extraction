Abstract
Background: WC and NS contributed equally.
Non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) frequently colonise patients
with end stage cystic fibrosis (CF), but its impact on the course of
the disease following lung transplantation is unknown.
Methods: Lung transplant recipients with CF who underwent lung
transplantation at our institution between January 1990 and May
2003 (n = 146) and CF patients awaiting lung transplantation in
May 2003 (n = 31) were studied retrospectively.
Results: The prevalence rate of NTM isolated from respiratory
cultures in patients with end stage CF referred for lung
transplantation was 19.7%, compared with a prevalence rate of
13.7% for NTM isolates in CF lung transplant recipients. The overall
prevalence of invasive NTM disease after lung transplantation was
low (3.4%) and was predicted most strongly by pre-transplant NTM
isolation (p = 0.001, Fisher’s exact test, odds ratio (OR) 6.13, 95%
CI 3.2 to 11.4). This association was restricted to Mycobacterium
abscessus (p = 0.005, Fisher’s exact test, OR 7.45, 95% CI 2.9 to
16.9). While NTM disease caused significant morbidity in a small
number of patients after transplantation, it was successfully treated
and did not influence the post-transplant course of the disease.


Conclusion: The isolation of NTM before transplantation in CF
patients should not be an exclusion criterion for lung
transplantation, but it may alert the clinician to patients at risk of
recurrence following transplantation.
