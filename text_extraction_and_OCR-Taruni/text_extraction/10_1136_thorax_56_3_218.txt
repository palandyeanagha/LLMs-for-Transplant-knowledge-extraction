Presented at the 19th Annual Meeting of
the International Society of Heart and
Lung Transplantation in San Francisco,
April 1999.
Abstract
BACKGROUND The EuroQol is a generic questionnaire developed
to provide a simple method for assigning utility values to health.
This study examines the applicability of the EuroQol to the
measurement of quality of life in single, bilateral, and heart-lung
transplantation.
METHODS A cross sectional study was performed in 87 patients
awaiting lung transplantation and in 255 transplant recipients
attending follow up clinics in four transplant units.
RESULTS In the waiting list group 61% reported extreme problems
in at least one of the five EuroQol quality of life domains compared
with 20% single lung recipients, 4% bilateral lung recipients, and
2% heart-lung recipients at 3 or more years after transplantation.
The mean utility value of patients on the waiting list was 0.31. In
comparison, utility values for recipients 3 years after
transplantation were 0.61 for single, 0.82 for bilateral, and 0.87 for
heart-lung transplants. The utility scores and health profiles of
bilateral and heart-lung recipients were consistently superior to
those of single lung recipients. Problems in all five domains were
more frequent in single lung recipients. Subjective assessment with
a visual analogue scale showed a similar trend.
CONCLUSIONS The EuroQol is a simple method of deriving a single
utility value for quality of life and is responsive to changes after
lung transplantation. It is worth considering as a means of
monitoring quality of life after transplantation and as an index of
quality of survival in research studies in solid organ transplantation.
These data suggest that quality of life after transplantation of one
lung is inferior to that after transplantation of two lungs.
