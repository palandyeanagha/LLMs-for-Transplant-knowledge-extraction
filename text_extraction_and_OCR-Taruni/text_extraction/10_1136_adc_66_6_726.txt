Intussusception in cystic fibrosis
M Holmes, V Murphy, M Taylor, B Denham
Abstract
Two cases of acute intussusception in older
children with cystic fibrosis are reported.
Both cases presented with symptoms and
signs consistent with meconium ileus equiva￾lent, which delayed the final diagnosis. Both
cases required abdominal surgery but made
full and uneventful recoveries.
Intussusception occurring after the age of 2
years is relatively rare, but occurs in at least 1%
of the population with cystic fibrosis.' We
report two cases of intussusception occurring in
patients with cystic fibrosis. A specific aetiology
could not be found in either case.

Case reports
CASE 1
A boy was diagnosed as having cystic fibrosis at
the age of 18 months by three positive sweat
tests (his sweat sodium concentrations were
100, 100, and 113 mmol/l). He had been on
pancreatic supplements since then with daily
physiotherapy and regular courses of intrave￾nous antibiotics. He had occasional meconium
ileus equivalent, which had always settled
promptly on treatment with 50 ml of oral
Gastrografm (Schering, a mixture of sodium
and meglumine diatrizoate). He was admitted to
hospital age 10 years complaining of sudden
onset of colicky abdominal pains and loose
stools. Abdominal examination was normal. A
plain radiograph of his abdomen showed ap￾preciable retention of faeces consistent with
meconium ileus equivalent. Gastrografm (50
ml) was given orally. The stools became more
loose and more frequent over the subsequent
three or four days but no relief was obtained.
An abdominal ultrasound was performed which
showed considerable constipation. A further 50
ml of oral Gastrografm was given. The next day
the patient passed bright red blood rectally. A
repeat plain radiograph of his abdomen (with
the small bowel outlined by the Gastrografin)
showed an obstruction at a point on the right
side of the abdomen. A laparotomy was per￾formed and an extensive ileocolic intussuscep￾tion was found extending into the descending
colon. The intussusception was reduced with￾out resection. No underlying cause was found.
Postoperative recovery was uneventful and the
patient was discharged home two weeks later on
normal diet and pancreatic supplements. There
was no exacerbation of his chest condition
during the illness.
CASE 2
A boy was diagnosed as suffering from cystic
fibrosis at the age of 6 months by three positive
sweat tests (his sweat sodium concentrations
were 100, 105, and 108 mmol/l). He had been
on pancreatic supplements with daily phy￾siotherapy since then and regular courses of oral
antibiotics for intercurrent infections. He had a
history of intermittent bouts of abdominal pain
with constipation. He was admitted to hospital
at age 4 years complaining of colicky abdominal
pains and constipation. Abdominal examination
was normal. A clinical diagnosis of meconium
ileus equivalent was made. Acetylcysteine was
commenced (5 ml three times a day). The
patient developed loose stools of increasing
frequency over the subsequent three days, but
otherwise showed no symptomatic improve￾ment. A vague mass was identified in the left
upper quadrant which was thought to be faeces.
This theory was supported by a plain radio￾graph of his abdomen. Daily bowel washouts
were commenced and the patient's condition
improved sufficiently over the subsequent five
days for him to be discharged from hospital.
The next day he was readmitted with an
occurrence of the original symptoms. Examina￾tion showed a distended abdomen but nothing
else. A plain radiograph of his abdomen
showed a complete absence of gas in the splenic
flexure and descending colon but no dilated
loops of bowel or fluid levels. Abdominal
ultrasound showed echogenic masses through￾out the colon that were thought to be due to a
faecally loaded colon. Subsequent plain radio￾graphs of his abdomen showed dilated loops of
bowel and fluid levels. A laparotomy was
performed because of the acute obstruction. An
ileocaecal intussusception was found with rup￾ture of the apex of the intussusception through
the wall of the sigmoid colon. A resection of
bowel was performed with ileocolic anastamo￾sis. As the sigmoid colon at the site of rupture
was of doubtful viability a colostomy was
fashioned with a view to later repair and
closure. This was done one month later. His
recovery was uneventful. He was discharged on
normal diet and pancreatic enzyme supplements
and the problem has not recurred.
Discussion
Acute intussusception is a common surgical
problem in the first two years of life but is rarely
observed in the older child.2 It is a recognised
complication in the older children who suffer
from cystic fibrosis and its incidence has been
put at 1% with an average age of onset between
9 and 12 years. ' Despite this fact, it is a compli￾cation that is difficult to diagnose and is often
overlooked.3 It may present with identical
symptoms to meconium ileus equivalent. Intus￾susception may not cause complete obstruction

and although common presenting symptoms are
colicky abdominal pains, vomiting and disturb￾ance of bowel habit, absolute constipation,
abdominal distention, and rectal bleeding are
less commonly described.' Abdominal examina￾tion may be essentially normal apart from a
'faecal mass'. Bowel sound may be normal.
Plain radiographs of the abdomen and abdomi￾nal ultrasound may not always be helpful in dis￾tinguishing intussusception from meconium
ileus equivalent and a barium enema may be
necessary. Some cases may not be diagnosed
until laparotomy as in the two cases described
here. Unlike intussusception in small children,
hydrostatic reduction in older children is less
successful and surgical reduction with or with￾out resection is often necessary.' 2 Apart from
thick putty like material in the caecum (prob￾ably due to a combination of pancreatic enzyme
deficiency and thick sticky mucus) no under￾lying cause is usually found.4 It is thought that
an inability of the intestine to propel the thick
putty like inspissated faeces along acts as the
precipitating factor.
CONCLUSION
Although intussusception is a recognised com￾plication of cystic fibrosis it is rarely reported. It
can present in a similar way to meconium ileus
equivalent. This may delay diagnosis. Where a
presumptive case of meconium ileus equivalent
fails to respond to Gastrografm or another
appropriate osmotic agent, a diagnosis of intus￾susception should be considered.

Abstract
Fatty infiltration of the liver at postmortem
examination has been recommended as a
criterion for selection of infants who have
died suddenly and unexpectedly for further
biochemical investigation for disorders of
fatty acid oxidation. We describe a boy with
medium chain acyl CoA dehydrogenase defi￾ciency who died four months after diagnosis
and in whom only minimal hepatic fatty
infiltration was found.
Medium chain acyl CoA dehydrogenase
(MCAD) deficiency is an inherited disorder of
fatty acid metabolism in which the ability to
oxidise fat is impaired.' Patients often present
within the first two years of life with hypogly￾caemia, acute encephalopathy similar to Reye's
syndrome and sudden, unexpected death.
MCAD deficiency and the other rarer defects of
fatty acid oxidation may be responsible for up to
5% of sudden, unexpected deaths in infancy
(SIDS),2 but it is not feasible to investigate
all SIDS for fatty acid oxidation defects. As
affected infants have had pronounced fatty infil￾tration of liver and muscle at postmortem
examination, it has been recommended that this
be used as a selection criteria.' We now report a
patient with MCAD deficiency who died sud￾denly and unexpectedly four months after
diagnosis. At postmortem examination only
minimal fatty change in the liver was present.
Case report
This boy was the first child of unrelated
parents, and he had been well until the age of 14
months when he presented with convulsions.
For the previous 24 hours he had been febrile
and had vomited several times. Several mem￾bers of his family had diarrhoea and both
Giardia lamblia and rotavirus were subse￾quently isolated from the patient's and the
grandfather's stools. On admission he was
unconscious with left sided focal seizures. He
was hypoglycaemic (plasma glucose concentra￾tion 0 5 mmol/l) with a mild metabolic acidosis
(pH 7T31, base deficit 10 mmol/l). Initially there
was no hepatomegaly but during the next three
days the liver became palpable 4 cm below the
costal margin. His plasma ammonia concentra￾tion was 60 [tmol/l. Although the aspartate
transaminase activity was 204 IU/l (normal
range up to 45 IU/1) and the alkaline phospha￾tase 1766 IU/l (normal range up to 340 IU/1), his
alanine transaminase, y-glutamyltransferase,
bilirubin, and prothrombin time were normal.
Electroencephalography demonstrated severe
widespread abnormality with right sided focal
features. He was treated with intravenous
dextrose and diazepam but despite correction of
the hypoglycaemia he had further convulsions
over the next three days. He made a gradual
recovery associated with a transient left sided
weakness.
Analysis of organic acids in the urine col￾lected on admission showed a hypoketotic
