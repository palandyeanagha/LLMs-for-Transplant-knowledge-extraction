Angina (Coronary Spastic Angina)” in 20085 and a digest 
version of the guidelines in English in 2010.6 In 2012, the JCS 
decided to revise the guidelines to reflect the findings obtained 
since the publication of the first version. The first guidelines 
were prepared by the Joint Working Groups consisting of 
members recommended by six academic societies, i.e., the 
JCS, the Japanese Coronary Association, the Japanese Asso￾ciation for Thoracic Surgery, the Japanese Association of 
Cardiovascular Intervention and Therapeutics, the Japanese 
College of Cardiology, and the Japanese Society for Cardio￾vascular Surgery. In the preparation of the revised version, 
some members were changed and new members from the 
Japanese Association of Cardioangioscopy participated in the 
Joint Working Groups.
In April 2012, the Joint Working Groups, consisting of 21 
members and 15 collaborators who have been at the forefront 
of research and clinical practice for the diagnosis and treat￾1. Introduction
Coronary spasm is defined as a condition in which a relatively 
large coronary artery running on the surface of the heart tran￾siently exhibits abnormal contraction. Variant angina, charac￾terized by ST elevation during anginal attacks, is considered a 
type of vasospastic angina. Coronary spasm has been shown 
to play a key role in the onset of not only variant angina but 
also rest angina, effort angina, acute myocardial infarction, 
and other related conditions.1 The mechanism of involvement 
of coronary spasm in the onset of acute coronary syndrome is 
now being elucidated.2–4

ment of vasospastic angina, began the revision process which 
lasted for one year.
During the five years since the publication of the first guide￾lines, a large amount of important evidence regarding the pa￾thology, diagnosis and treatment of vasospastic angina were 
reported. Especially important is the contribution of the Japa￾nese Coronary Spasm Association that was established to reg￾ister patients with vasospastic angina and clarify the features 
of the disease among Japanese patients. The present revision 
reflects evidence reported by the association that has greatly 
contributed to clarifying the pathophysiology of sudden death 
and out-of-hospital cardiac arrest due to coronary spasm and 
determining treatment strategies for the disease.7,8 Recommen￾dations for points where sufficient evidence has not been ac￾cumulated reflect current views obtained through discussions 
by the Joint Working Groups. As in the previous guidelines, 
the level of evidence is not indicated in the present guideline 
document. Recommendations are classified as follows:
Classification of Recommendations
Class I:    The benefits and efficacy of a method of evaluation 
or treatment have been demonstrated or are widely 
approved.
Class II:   Some discrepancy exists in findings or opinions 
regarding the benefits and efficacy of a method of 
evaluation or treatment.
Class IIa:  As judged from available findings and opinions, a 
method of evaluation or treatment is likely to be 
beneficial and effective.
Class IIb:  As judged from available opinions, neither the ben￾efits nor the efficacy of a method of evaluation or 
treatment have been well established.
Class III:    A method of evaluation or treatment has been dem￾onstrated to be useless and possibly harmful at 
times, or its harmfulness has been widely agreed 
upon.
The present revised guidelines describe standard methods 
for the diagnosis and treatment of vasospastic angina that fit 
into current clinical practice on the basis of currently available 
evidence. However, individual patients have their own specific 
clinical features, and you are encouraged to use the guidelines 
with this fact in mind. The present guidelines provide guid￾ance on the diagnosis and treatment of patients with vasospas￾tic angina for physicians in clinical practice. The final deci￾sions regarding diagnosis and treatment should be made by the 
attending physicians after the pathologic condition of each 
patient has been individually determined. In addition, even if 
a diagnosis or treatment not in conformity with the guidelines 
is implemented, it should be noted that determination of treat￾ment by attending physicians based on the specific conditions 
and circumstances of their patients should take precedence 
over the guidelines, and that the present guidelines provide no 
grounds for argument in cases of legal prosecution.
We hope that the present revised guidelines will be useful 
in the diagnosis and treatment of patients with vasospastic an￾gina by cardiologists and all other physicians.
I Overview
1. Definition and Pathology
1.1  Characterization of Coronary Spasm in Ischemic Heart 
Disease
1.1.1  Characterization of Coronary Spasm in Terms of the 
Etiology of Angina
In coronary spasm, sudden excessive coronary vasoconstric￾tion produces a transient reduction of blood flow, resulting in 
myocardial ischemia (supply ischemia/primary angina). Al￾though coronary spasm occurs mainly in large coronary arter￾ies running on the surface of the heart, it is also known to 
occur in the coronary microvasculature of the myocardium.9
Coronary spasm is not always preceded by elevations of blood 
pressure and heart rate, which increase myocardial oxygen con￾sumption. In this regard, coronary spasm is a pathological con￾dition that is clearly distinguishable from demand ischemia/
secondary angina represented by effort angina.
Coronary spasm develops in sclerotic lesions of varying se￾verity. Even when no stenotic lesions are visible on coronary 
angiography, intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) reveals clear 
arteriosclerotic lesions in locations consistent with regions of 
coronary spasm.10 Reduction of blood flow due to coronary 
spasm activates platelets and the coagulation system,11 causing 
vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation.12 It has in fact been 
revealed by evaluation using quantitative coronary angiogra￾phy that the locations of coronary spasm induced in provoca￾tion tests were particularly susceptible to progression of arte￾riosclerosis.13,14
1.1.2  Characterization of Coronary Spasm in Acute 
Coronary Syndrome
It was reported as early as the 1970s that coronary spasm can 
trigger not only angina but also myocardial infarction. There 
have been patients with acute myocardial infarction in whom 
emergent coronary angiography revealed extremely mild or￾ganic stenosis, as well as patients with complete coronary 
occlusion which exhibited recanalization after administration 
of nitrates alone. Recently, unstable angina, acute myocardial 
infarction, and sudden ischemic cardiac death have been re￾ferred to collectively as acute coronary syndrome. This is be￾cause these diseases share the pathological finding of rapid 
progression of coronary lesions, i.e., disruption of coronary 
atheroma (plaque) and the resulting thrombus formation.15
Coronary plaques are observed in the form of local thicken￾ing of the intima, and are structurally characterized by the 
accumulation of foamy macrophages forming a lipid core cov￾ered by a fibrous cap of connective tissue and smooth muscle 
cells. It has been hypothesized that if a tear occurs in this cap, 
the highly thrombogenic plaque content becomes exposed to 
the blood flow and rapidly forms thrombi that obstruct the 
vascular lumen. Plaques more likely to be ruptured are termed 
vulnerable plaques; they are often characterized by high lipid 
content and a thinned fibrous cap.
It has been suggested that coronary spasm is a cause of 
rupture of vulnerable plaques. Investigations of coronary le￾sions in autopsies have demonstrated that spasm causes endo￾thelial cell derangement and fibrous cap rupture, resulting in 
the protrusion of the plaque content exposed to the vascular 
lumen, where thrombi are produced.16 In addition, coronary 
spasm is accompanied by hypercoagulation,17 decreased fibri-

nolytic activity,18 and activation of platelets and adhesion 
molecules,19 resulting in a thrombophilic state in acute coro￾nary syndrome. Although plaque stabilization (prevention of 
rupture) and antithrombotic therapy are important in the pre￾vention and treatment of acute coronary syndrome, prevention 
of coronary spasm is also important, particularly in Japanese, 
in whom the prevalence of coronary spasm is higher than in 
Western countries.
1.2 Diagnostic Criteria
At present, vasospastic angina is diagnosed in Japan using 
criteria independently adopted by individual institutions.20 In 
this background, the present guidelines are established to unify 
the diagnostic criteria with reference to previous reports and 
other findings. Yasue et al. state that vasospastic angina can be 
diagnosed even without performing coronary angiography, 
provided that anginal attacks disappear quickly upon admin￾istration of nitroglycerin, and that any one of the five condi￾tions shown below is met: (1) attacks appear at rest, particu￾larly between night and early morning; (2) marked diurnal 
variation is observed in exercise tolerance (in particular, re￾duction of exercise capacity in the early morning); (3) attacks 
are accompanied by ST elevation on the ECG; (4) attacks are 
induced by hyperventilation (hyperpnea); (5) attacks are sup￾pressed by calcium channel blockers but not by β-blockers.21
In the present guidelines, reference items based on that opin￾ion are included in the diagnostic criteria established for three 
grades: “Definite”, “Suspected”, or “Unlikely”. The diagnostic 
criteria for vasospastic angina are provided below. A diagnos￾tic algorithm is shown in Figure 1.
1.2.1  Diagnostic Criteria for “Definite/Suspected” 
Vasospastic Angina
If any one of the following conditions and one of the follow￾ing requirements are met, Definite/Suspected vasospastic an￾gina is considered present. If none of them are met, the condi￾tion is judged Unlikely to be vasospastic angina. Clinically, 
both Definite and Suspected vasospastic angina are diagnosed 
as vasospastic angina.
a. Conditions (Any One of the Three Below)
1.  Spontaneous attacks
2.  Positive non-drug-induced coronary spasm provocation 
test (e.g., hyperventilation test and exercise test)
3.  Positive drug-induced coronary spasm provocation test 
(e.g., acetylcholine provocation test and ergonovine provo￾cation test)
b. Requirements
Definite Vasospastic Angina: The patient is considered to 
have Definite vasospastic angina when ischemic change is 
clearly observed on the ECG during attacks;*1 when the ECG 
findings are borderline but a clear finding of myocardial isch￾emia or coronary spasm is obtained in examinations*2 and he/
she has a history and symptoms during attacks that are consis￾tent with vasospastic angina; or when, if there is no ECG change 
during attacks or if ECG examination has not been performed, 
at least one of the following reference items is met, and ex￾aminations*2 reveal a clear finding of myocardial ischemia or 
coronary spasm.
Suspected Vasospastic Angina: The patient is considered to 
have Suspected vasospastic angina when the ischemic change 
on ECG during attacks is in the borderline, and no clear find￾ing of myocardial ischemia or coronary spasm is obtained in 
any examination;*2 or when, if there is no change on the ECG 
during attacks or ECG examination has not been performed, 
one or more of the following reference items apply, and a clear 
finding of myocardial ischemia or coronary spasm cannot be 
Figure 1.  Diagnostic algorithm of vasospastic angina. *1: Ischemic change is defined as a transient ST elevation of 0.1mV or more, 
an ST depression of 0.1mV or more, or new appearance of negative U waves, recorded in at least two contiguous leads on the 
12-lead ECG. If the ischemic ECG change is prolonged, patients should be treated as directed in the guidelines for management 
of acute coronary syndrome.22,23 *2: Examinations include the drug-induced coronary spasm provocation test during cardiac 
catheterization and hyperventilation test. A positive finding for coronary spasm on coronary angiography in the acetylcholine- or 
ergonovine-induced coronary spasm provocation test is defined as “transient, total, or sub-total occlusion (>90% stenosis) of a 
coronary artery with signs/symptoms of myocardial ischemia (anginal pain and ischemic ECG change)”.24–27

demonstrated on any examination.*2
*1:  Ischemic change is defined as a transient ST elevation of 
0.1mV or more, an ST depression of 0.1mV or more, or 
new appearance of negative U waves, recorded in at least 
two contiguous leads on the 12-lead ECG. If the ischemic 
ECG change is prolonged, patients should be treated as 
directed in the guidelines for management of acute coro￾nary syndrome.22,23
*2:  Examinations include the drug-induced coronary spasm 
provocation test during cardiac catheterization and hyper￾ventilation test. A positive finding for coronary spasm on 
coronary angiography in the acetylcholine- or ergonovine￾induced coronary spasm provocation test is defined as 
“transient, total, or sub-total occlusion (>90% stenosis) of 
a coronary artery with signs/symptoms of myocardial isch￾emia (anginal pain and ischemic ECG change24–27)”. It 
should be noted that diffuse coronary spasm in addition to 
focal coronary spasm often occurs among Japanese patients. 
The diagnostic criteria for diffuse coronary spasm should 
be established in the future.
c. Reference Items
An angina-like attack that disappears quickly upon adminis￾tration of a nitrate, and that meets at least one of the following 
four items:
1.  Appears at rest, particularly between night and early morn￾ing.
2.  Marked diurnal variation in exercise tolerance is observed 
(in particular, reduction of exercise capacity in the early 
morning).
3.  Induced by hyperventilation (hyperpnea).
4.  Attacks are suppressed by calcium channel blockers but not 
by β-blockers.
2. Etiology and Epidemiology
2.1 Etiology
2.1.1 Environmental Factors
a. Smoking
A large number of coronary risk factors have been identified, 
including hypertension, lipid abnormalities, smoking, diabetes 
mellitus, and obesity. Of these, smoking is a well-recognized 
risk factor for coronary spasm.28–31 In fact, many reports have 
shown that a high percentage of patients with vasospastic an￾gina in Japan are tobacco smokers. Smoking is a controllable 
factor in preventing the development of coronary spasm; 
smoking cessation programs are thus indispensable in the treat￾ment of vasospastic angina.32
b. Drinking
Patients with vasospastic angina in Japan include many ha￾bitual drinkers.29 Alcohol promotes the urinary excretion of 
magnesium, which in turn is likely to lead to tissue magne￾sium deficiency. It has been shown that many patients with 
vasospastic angina have magnesium deficiency,33 and it has 
been reported that intravenous administration of magnesium 
prevents hyperpnea-related attacks of coronary spasm.34 Alco￾hol restriction is thus required in patients with vasospastic 
angina.
c. Lipid Abnormalities and Abnormal Glucose Metabolism
It has been reported that patients with vasospastic angina often 
have abnormalities of lipid metabolism and glucose metabo￾lism as complications. It has been suggested that oxidative 
stress may be associated with abnormalities of triglyceride 
metabolism, HDL cholesterol level reduction, and impaired 
glucose tolerance.35–37
d. Stress (Abnormal Autonomic Nervous System Function)
Attacks of coronary spasm are induced by a wide variety of 
stimuli that act on receptors on coronary smooth muscle cells, 
including those due to abnormal autonomic nervous system 
function.38 In addition to its direct effect, i.e., the release of 
vasopressor neurotransmitters such as noradrenaline, platelet 
activation via the sympathetic nervous system also causes the 
release of serotonin, a potent coronary constrictor. Many anal￾yses focusing on heart rate variability have reported that in 
patients with vasospastic angina, as in those with other types 
of ischemic heart disease, parasympathetic nervous dysfunc￾tion tends to cause an imbalance in sympathetic and parasym￾pathetic nerve, with predominance of sympathetic activity.39,40
2.1.2 Genetic Factors
Since coronary diseases are often familial, and persons with 
no lifestyle-related risk factors can nevertheless develop them, 
it has been suggested that “genetic factors” may also be in￾volved in their onset. In recent years, due to the remarkable 
advances in molecular biology, genes involved in the patho￾physiology of various diseases have been cloned, and genome 
polymorphisms and variations have been identified; a great 
deal of research into multifactorial diseases has emerged, in￾cluding that on lifestyle-related diseases, from molecular epi￾demiological perspectives. Single nucleotide polymorphism 
(SNP), in particular, is a form of polymorphism found in a 
large number of genes in the genome. It has been suggested 
that changes in the level of expression or function of protein 
molecules encoded by genes exhibiting SNPs may affect dis￾ease susceptibility. Analysis of the associations between these 
SNPs and coronary diseases is expected to elucidate the ge￾netic factors involved in the pathophysiology of the diseases, 
and contribute to their primary prevention by tailor-made med￾icine based on individual genetic features. In particular, coro￾nary spasm occurs at a higher incidence in Japanese than in 
Western individuals, and has been suggested to involve ge￾netic factors. SNPs that have been identified as related to va￾sospastic angina include (1) the endothelial nitric oxide syn￾thase (eNOS) gene Glu298Asp polymorphism,41–44 (2) the eNOS 
gene-786T/C polymorphism,45–50 (3) the eNOS gene intron 4b/a 
polymorphism,51–53 and (4) the phospholipase C-δ1 (PLC-δ1) 
missense mutation (R257H).54–56 It has been reported that the 
-389 G/A SNP (rs5963409) located in the transcribed region 
of the ornithine transcarbamylase gene is associated with 
hypertension and coronary artery vasomotion,57 and that 
rs10498345, a SNP in non-coding region, is associated with 
coronary spasm in Japanese women in whom the effect of 
smoking is relatively small.58
2.2  Epidemiology: Prevalence and Race-Related 
Differences (Characteristics of Japanese)
2.2.1 Prevalence of Vasospastic Angina
To determine the prevalence of vasospastic angina, a survey 
was conducted on 2,251 consecutive patients with angina (av￾erage age of 65.2 years) hospitalized in 15 major cardiovascu￾lar medical institutions in Japan in 1998.59 Figure 2 shows the 
age group distribution of the disease in the study population. 
In Japan as well as Western countries, angina is more preva￾lent among males than females, and male prevalence increas￾es with age. In females, the incidence of angina begins to rise 

Circulation Journal Vol.78, November 2014
JCS Guidelines for VSA 2783
at the average age of menopause, around 50 years, and sex￾related differences in incidence no longer exist at above 80 
years of age. In females, menopause represents a turning point 
in the onset of heart disease, and decreases in female sex hor￾mones appear to play very important roles in this. Although 
the prevalence of vasospastic angina varies among institu￾tions, about 40% of patients with angina studied had vasospas￾tic angina. Analysis of the age group distribution of vasospas￾tic angina revealed that prevalence tended to be higher in 
relatively young patients than in elderly ones (Figure 3).
2.2.2 Race-Related Differences
Results of drug-induced coronary spasm provocation tests in 
Japan and Europe revealed higher incidences of coronary 
spasm in Japan than in Europe,27,60–62 although there were dif￾ferences in both the route and dose level of administration of 
spasm inducers used.
Characteristics of cases of vasospastic angina reported in 
Japan29,63,64 and Western countries65–68 are summarized in Table. 
Although the female ratio is not high in either population, 
Japan has a lower female ratio than Western countries. Pa￾tients with a history of myocardial infarction, those with or￾ganic coronary stenosis, and those with multivessel diseases 
are prevalent among Western people. Reflecting these find￾ings, left ventricular dysfunction is more prevalent in West￾erners. The mortality rate in patients with vasospastic angina 
is lower for Japanese; this is attributable to the fact that the 
incidence of myocardial infarction is higher in Westerners than 
in Japanese.
It has been reported that multivessel coronary spasm is more 
prevalent in Japanese than in Westerners. Previous studies in 
Japan has described that multivessel coronary spasm was ob￾served in 8% of patients with vasospastic angina,29,63,64 but the 
Japanese Coronary Spasm Association recently reported that 
provocation tests using acetylcholine or ergonovine induced 
multivessel coronary spasm in 32% of patients with vasospas￾tic angina.7 In a single-center study, intracoronary acetylcho￾line injection provoked multivessel coronary spasm in 42% of 
patients with vasospastic angina.69 Data including those in 
Western countries should be accumulated to compare the prev￾alence of multivessel coronary spasm in different races.
There are reports that coronary spasm was observed by 
provocation tests early after the onset of myocardial infarction 
in 11~21% of Westerners,70,71 and 69% of Japanese.72 The fre￾quency of the total occlusion of the culprit lesions in the acute 
phase of myocardial infarction is significantly higher in West￾erners (82%, 1,539/1,884) than in Japanese (64%, 296/465).73
This finding suggests that coronary spasm may be involved in 
the development of myocardial infarction in many Japanese 
patients.

3. Pathophysiology
3.1 Involvement of Vascular Endothelial Cells
In patients with vasospastic angina, coronary spasm can be 
induced at high incidence without producing a change in sys￾temic hemodynamics, by injecting acetylcholine directly into 
a coronary artery.24 Acetylcholine dilates blood vessels when 
the vascular endothelium is normal, but if there is endothelial 
detachment or injury, it contracts blood vessels. This occurs 
because nitric oxide (NO), a potent smooth muscle relaxant, 
is secreted from endothelial cells, provided that the vascular 
endothelium is intact.74 In the endothelium, NO is produced 
by eNOS, which releases NO upon activation by a wide vari￾ety of signals. On the other hand, eNOS becomes activated via 
calmodulin as a result of elevation of intracellular Ca2+ level 
by mechanical stimuli such as shear stress. The receptor-me￾diated vasodilation induced by vasoactive mediators such as 
acetylcholine, bradykinin, and serotonin activates receptors, G 
proteins, and phospholipase C (PLC) in vascular endothelium 
to produce inositol triphosphate (IP3) and release stored Ca2+
in cells. This receptor stimulation promotes Ca2+ inflow 
through ionic channels. Stimulation by physiological active 
substances such as acetylcholine, bradykinin, and insulin and 
mechanical stimuli such as shear stress also increase eNOS 
activity.75
Nitrates are metabolized to NO in the body, which in turn 
stimulates the soluble guanylate cyclase in vascular smooth 
muscle to increase the level of cyclic guanosine monophos￾phate (cGMP) and dilate blood vessels.76 Because NO is pro￾duced and released from normal vascular endothelium, the 
hyperreactivity of spastic coronary arteries to nitroglycerin is 
probably due to a lack of baseline production or release of NO 
from the endothelium in these arteries.77
3.2 Involvement of Vascular Smooth Muscles
Studies have elucidated the mechanism of contraction of vas￾cular smooth muscles. Specifically, in response to stimulation 
by vasopressor substances such as catecholamines and sero￾tonin, L-type Ca2+ channels on vascular smooth muscle cells 
open, and extracellular Ca2+ ions enter into the cells. PLC in 
cells produces IP3, which opens Ca2+ channels on sarcoplas￾mic reticulum that stores Ca2+, to release Ca2+ into the cyto￾plasm, resulting in an increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentra￾tion. The Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum and 
Ca2+ inflow from outside the cells result in increased intracel￾lular Ca2+ levels, and calcium ions bind to calmodulin to form 
Ca2+/calmodulin complexes. These complexes activate myo￾sin light-chain kinase (MLCK) to phosphorylate the myosin 
light-chain (MLC). Phosphorylated MLC interacts with actin, 
another contractile protein, to induce the contraction of vascu￾lar smooth muscle. Subsequently, as the intracellular Ca2+ con￾centration falls, Ca2+ dissociates from calmodulin, and MLCK 
becomes inactivated. As a result, the activity of myosin light￾chain phosphatase (MLCPh) becomes dominant, MLC under￾goes dephosphorylation, and vascular smooth muscle relaxes.78
The phosphorylation of MLC is promoted and suppressed 
by MLCK and MLCPh, respectively. In addition, MLCPh has 
been shown to be suppressed by Rho-kinase. Rho-kinase is an 
important molecular switch that controls the contraction and 
relaxation of vascular smooth muscle independently of intra￾cellular Ca2+ concentration. Upon stimulation by a vasopressor 
substance, Rho, a low-molecular-weight G protein, is acti￾vated via the G protein-coupled receptor, and Rho-kinase, one 
of its target proteins, is activated. The activated Rho-kinase 
phosphorylates the myosin-binding subunit (MBS) of MLCPh 
to inhibit its activity. As a result, the balance between MLCK 
and MLCPh activities is lost and MLCK becomes dominant, 
which promotes the phosphorylation of MLC and induces ex￾cessive contraction of vascular smooth muscle.79,80
II Diagnosis
1. Subjective Symptoms and Physical Findings
1.1 Subjective Symptoms
(1)  Characterized by vague pain that cannot be indicated by a 
single finger, with a sensation of compression, a pressing 
sensation, and a sensation of tightness in the precordium, 
especially in the center of the substernal region. Occasion￾ally, symptoms develop in the upper abdomen. Patients 
are often asymptomatic.81
(2)  Typically appears at rest, with pain persisting for several 
to about 15 minutes. The pain often radiates to the neck, 
jaws, left shoulder, and elsewhere, occasionally accompa￾nied by symptoms such as numbness and weakness of the 
left shoulder and upper arm.
(3)  Anginal attacks due to coronary spasm often persist lon￾ger than effort anginal attacks due to organic stenotic le￾sions, and are sometimes accompanied by cold sweats and 
disturbance of consciousness including syncope.
(4)  Can be induced by hyperpnea and drinking of alcohol.
(5)  Fast-acting nitrates are remarkably effective against at￾tacks of coronary spasm.
(6)  Calcium channel blockers suppress attacks of coronary 
spasm.
(7)  Attacks are often accompanied by arrhythmias; if they are 
complicated by complete atrioventricular block, ventricu￾lar tachycardia, or ventricular fibrillation, disturbance of 
consciousness or syncope is observed.
(8)  Attacks of coronary spasm typically occur at rest between 
night and early morning.
     They are usually not induced by daytime exercise. Diur￾nal variation with a peak between night and early morning 
is observed; 67% of attacks are asymptomatic episodes 
of myocardial ischemia without subjective symptoms 
(Figure 4).81 Usually, attacks of vasospastic angina can 
be induced by even slight effort in the early morning, but 
are not induced by even strenuous effort in the afternoon 
or later in the day. Hence, diurnal variation is also observed 
in exercise tolerance in patients with vasospastic angina.
(9)  Attacks of coronary spasm may occur frequently, i.e., sev￾eral times every day, or may not occur for several months 
to several years.
1.2 Physical Findings
In auscultation during attacks, gallop rhythms and systolic 
murmurs are sometimes heard. These are caused by decreased 
wall motion, mitral regurgitation, and other changes resulting 
from ischemia. If symptoms disappear upon administration of 
a fast-acting nitrate or similar agent, these findings may also 
disappear. Hypotension may occur during attacks. In addition, 

Circulation Journal Vol.78, November 2014
JCS Guidelines for VSA 2785
since the arrhythmias developing in association with attacks 
include complete atrioventricular block, ventricular tachycar￾dia, and ventricular fibrillation, they must be monitored for 
carefully.
2. Methods of Evaluation
2.1 Non-Invasive Evaluation
2.1.1 ECG and Holter Recording
Class I
-  Two ECG records, obtained during an attack and after ad￾ministration of fast-acting nitrate or just after symptom sta￾bilization in cases in which vasospastic angina is strongly 
suspected based on subjective symptoms
-  Holter recording (multi-channel recording acceptable) for 
an extended period of time of 24~48 hours in cases in which 
vasospastic angina is strongly suspected based on subjective 
symptoms accompanied by syncope or palpitations without 
identifiable cause
Class IIa
-  Holter recording for 24~48 hours in cases in which it is dif￾ficult to record the ECG during attacks
Class IIb
-  ECG or Holter recording in patients in whom the likelihood 
of vasospastic angina is low, as judged from the patient’s 
age, subjective symptoms, and background
-  12-lead ECG records targeting time periods in which attacks 
are prevalent (in cases in which hyperventilation and exer￾cise tests cannot be performed)
Class III
   None
a. Standard 12-Lead ECG
The ECG often exhibits normal findings in the absence of at￾tacks. Hence, when symptoms occur frequently, a diagnosis 
can be established* by recording the 12-lead ECG both in the 
presence and the absence of an attack. Typical ECG changes 
during attacks of vasospastic angina include ST elevation in 
leads corresponding to the culprit lesion and ST depression in 
contralateral leads. The diagnosis can be made because these 
findings normalize upon administration of a fast-acting nitrate. 
Many patients with vasospastic angina have moderate organic 
stenosis of the affected coronary arteries, and in some cases 
only ST depression is present in contiguous leads and the ab￾sence of ST elevation appears to depend on the severity of 
coronary spasm or ischemia.82 Other possible findings include 
the appearance of negative T waves in the culprit lesion during 
recovery from ischemia, and the new emergence of negative 
U waves during spasm.63
*: Criteria for Positive Ischemic ECG Finding
    If an ST elevation of 0.1mV or more, an ST depression of 
0.1mV or more, or new appearance of negative U waves is 
recorded in at least two contiguous leads on the 12-lead 
ECG during an attack, ECG findings are considered indica￾tive of ischemic change.
b. Holter Recording
In patients with vasospastic angina, chest pain develops in about 
20~30% of episodes of ischemic ST change, and many events 
of coronary spasm are asymptomatic.81 Because attacks are 
prevalent between night and early morning at rest, the isch￾emic ST changes that occur during an attack are often unre￾cordable except in the hospitalization setting. In such cases, 
Holter recording is the most useful examination.83 If ischemia 
persists for 5 minutes or longer, chest pain is likely to be pres￾ent; ECG recordings during symptomatic ischemic episodes 
should be evaluated in detail for characteristics of ST segment 
levels and the occurrence of arrhythmia. Attention to asymp￾tomatic ST-T changes is also required.
2.1.2 Exercise Test84–91
Class I
   None
Class IIa
-  Exercise test in the early morning* and daytime in patients 
with diurnal variation in exercise tolerance

-  Exercise test in patients who are in stable condition and 
suspected of having vasospastic angina
Class III
-  Exercise test in patients who are in unstable condition and 
in whom acute coronary syndrome cannot be ruled out
*:  Exercise Test in the Early Morning
    If an exercise test in the early morning reveals at least one 
of the following findings, and the findings of ECG and ex￾Figure 4.  Diurnal variation of at￾tacks of coronary spasm. Adapted

least two contiguous leads during the exercise test
   2.  Appearance of ST depression of 0.1mV or more in at 
least two contiguous leads during the exercise test
   3.  Appearance of negative U waves not observed at rest, 
during the exercise test
2.1.3 Hyperventilation Test81,92–100
Class I
   None
Class IIa
-  Hyperventilation test in patients suspected of having vaso￾spastic angina with a low frequency of attacks
Class IIb
-  Hyperventilation test in patients suspected of having vaso￾spastic angina with a high frequency of attacks
Class III
-  Hyperventilation test in patients suspected of having acute 
coronary syndrome
Method
1.  It is desirable that the hyperventilation test be conducted at 
rest in the early morning after an interval of at least 48 
hours from administration of vasoactive drugs.
2.  Always monitor the 12-lead ECG during the hyperventila￾tion and for 10 minutes after its completion.
3.  Measure blood pressure every minute.
4.  Place the patient in supine position and obtain the resting 
12-lead ECG and blood pressure, and then provide an ex￾planation of hyperventilation. Subsequently, promote vig￾orous hyperventilation (target: respiratory rate of 25 times/
minute or higher) for 6 minutes, to the extent possible for 
the patient.
5.  If the onset of an anginal attack or a significant ST-T change 
on the ECG is observed during artificial hyperventilation, 
discontinue it immediately.
6.  In the event of an anginal attack, administer a fast-acting 
nitrate immediately.
7.  Evaluation of ST level should be performed at 80ms after 
the J point on the ECG.
Criteria for Positive ECG Finding of Coronary Spasm on 
Hyperventilation Test
If at least one of the following findings is obtained, a posi￾tive ECG finding of coronary spasm is considered present.
1.  Appearance of ST elevation of 0.1mV or more in at least 
two contiguous leads during the hyperventilation test
2.  Appearance of ST depression of 0.1mV or more in at 
least two contiguous leads during the hyperventilation 
test

2.2 Invasive Evaluation (Cardiac Catheterization)
A drug-induced coronary spasm provocation test is performed 
by intracoronary administration of acetylcholine or ergonovine. 
If increased diagnostic accuracy is desired, a washout period 
of 2 days or longer for any calcium channel blockers and long￾acting nitrates should be included whenever possible.
For patients undergoing this examination, patients must be 
fully explained and provide informed consent for the invasive 
procedures.
2.2.1 Acetylcholine Provocation Test24–27,29,72,139–141

-  Acetylcholine provocation test during coronary angiography 
performed in patients in whom vasospastic angina is sus￾pected based on symptoms, but who have not been diagnosed 
with coronary spasm by non-invasive evaluation

JCS Guidelines for VSA 2787
Class III
-  Acetylcholine provocation test during coronary angiography 
performed in patients without symptoms suggestive of va￾sospastic angina
-  Acetylcholine provocation test during coronary angiography 
performed in patients who are considered at high risk of 
suffering a life-threatening complication of induced coro￾nary spasm (e.g., patients with left main coronary trunk le￾sions; those with multivessel coronary lesions, including 
obstructive lesions; those with severe cardiac dysfunction; 
and those with untreated congestive heart failure) (however, 
in cases in which the onset of severe cardiac dysfunction or 
congestive heart failure may be a consequence of coronary 
spasm, the criteria for Class IIb apply)
-  Acetylcholine provocation test during emergent coronary 
angiography performed in patients with acute coronary syn￾drome
In an acetylcholine- or ergonovine-induced coronary spasm 
provocation test, coronary spasm is defined as “transient, total, 
or sub-total occlusion (>90% stenosis) of a coronary artery 
with signs/symptoms of myocardial ischemia (anginal pain 
and ischemic ST changes)”.
Standard Method of Provocation Test24–27,139,140
1.  Insertion of a Temporary Pacing Electrode in the Right 
Ventricle: Administration of acetylcholine, especially in 
the right coronary artery, may cause transient episodes of 
severe bradycardia. Perform backup pacing (40~50bpm).
2.  Control Angiography of Left and Right Coronary Ar￾teries: Perform angiography in an appropriate projection 
that ensures the best separation of the branches of each 
coronary artery. After injection of acetylcholine, perform 
angiography in the same projection again.
3.  Injection of Acetylcholine Into the Left Coronary Ar￾tery: Inject 20, 50, or 100μg of acetylcholine in solution 
in 37°C physiological saline (concentration adjusted to ob￾tain 5mL solution volume for each quantity of acetylcho￾line) into the left coronary artery over a period of 20 sec￾onds. Perform coronary angiography 1 minute after the start 
of each injection. In the event of an ischemic change on the 
ECG or chest pain, perform angiography at that time. Doses 
of acetylcholine should be given at 5-minute intervals.
4.  Injection of Acetylcholine Into Right Coronary Artery:
Inject 20 or 50μg of acetylcholine (each in 5mL solution) into 
the right coronary artery over a period of 20 seconds. The tim￾ing of angiography is the same as for the left coronary artery.
5.  Left and Right Coronary Angiography After adminis￾tration of Nitrate: Administer a nitrate into each coronary 
artery, and perform angiography while the coronary artery 
is maximally dilated.
2.2.2 Ergonovine Provocation Test20,29,60–62,140,142–148
Class I
-  Ergonovine provocation test during coronary angiography 
performed in patients in whom vasospastic angina is sus￾pected based on symptoms, but in whom coronary spasm has 
not been diagnosed by non-invasive evaluation
Class IIa
-  Ergonovine provocation test during coronary angiography 
performed in patients who have been diagnosed with coro￾nary spasm by non-invasive evaluation, and in whom medi￾cal treatment is ineffective or insufficiently effective
Class IIb
-  Ergonovine provocation test during coronary angiography 
performed in patients who have been diagnosed with coro￾nary spasm by non-invasive or invasive evaluation, and in 
whom medical treatment has been proven to be effective
Class III
-  Ergonovine provocation test during coronary angiography 
performed in patients without symptoms suggestive of va￾sospastic angina
-  Ergonovine provocation test during coronary angiography 
performed in patients considered at high risk of suffering a 
life-threatening complication of induced coronary spasm 
(e.g., patients with left main coronary trunk lesions; those 
with multivessel coronary lesions, including obstructive le￾sions; those with severe cardiac dysfunction; and those with 
untreated congestive heart failure) (however, in cases in which 
the onset of severe cardiac dysfunction or congestive heart 
failure may be a consequence of coronary spasm, the criteria 
for Class IIb apply)
-  Ergonovine provocation test during emergent coronary an￾giography performed in patients with acute coronary syn￾drome
As with the acetylcholine provocation test, coronary spasm 
during the ergonovine provocation test is defined as “transient, 
total, or sub-total occlusion (>90% stenosis) of a coronary 
artery with signs of myocardial ischemia (anginal pain and 
ischemic ST changes)”. In the present guidelines, it is recom￾mended for reasons of safety that the ergonovine provocation 
test be conducted with intracoronary rather than intravenous 
administration.
Standard Method of Provocation Test (Intracoronary 
Administration)60–62,142–146
1.  Control Angiography of Left and Right Coronary Ar￾teries: Perform angiography in an appropriate projection 
that ensures the best separation of the branches of each 
coronary artery. After injection of ergonovine, perform an￾giography in the same projection again.
2.  Injection of Ergonovine Into the Left Coronary Artery:
Inject 20~60μg of ergonovine in solution in physiological 
saline into the left coronary artery over a period of several 
minutes (about 2~5 minutes). Perform coronary angiogra￾phy 1~2 minutes after completion of the injection. In the 
event of an ischemic change on the ECG or chest symptom, 
perform angiography at the time of its onset. In case of a 
negative result in the provocation test, proceed to the right 
coronary provocation test 5 minutes later.
3.  Injection of Ergonovine Into the Right Coronary Ar￾tery: Inject 20~60μg of ergonovine in solution in physi￾ological saline into the right coronary artery over a period 
of several minutes (about 2~5 minutes). The timing of an￾giography is the same as for the left coronary artery.
4.  Left and Right Coronary Angiography After adminis￾tration of Nitrate: Administer a sufficient dose of nitrate 
into each coronary artery, and perform angiography while 
the coronary artery is maximally dilated.

   None
Class IIb
-  Measurement of coronary sinus lactate levels during a drug￾induced coronary spasm provocation test
Class III
   None
A catheter is placed in the coronary sinus, and coronary spasm 
is induced with acetylcholine or a similar agent. Coronary 
venous blood and blood from the base of the aorta or coronary 
arterial blood is drawn before and after the induction, and 
lactate metabolism in the myocardium is examined. Upon the 
development of ischemia, myocardial lactate consumption de￾creases; as the ischemia increases in severity, a shift to lactate 
production occurs.152,153 Although lactate consumption decreas￾es during coronary spasm, whether the shift to lactate produc￾tion occurs depends on the severity of ischemia, the site where 
the ischemia occurs, and other factors. This parameter is also 
considered useful as a marker of the onset of myocardial isch￾emia in the diagnosis of coronary microvascular spasm.154
2.2.5 Coronary Angioscopy155–159
Coronary angioscopy in patients with vasospastic angina is 
usually performed for the purpose of investigating the patho￾logical condition or mechanism of onset of vasospastic angina, 
rather than for diagnostic purposes.
2.2.6 IVUS10,160–166
The major role of IVUS in the diagnosis of vasospastic angina 
is to elucidate its pathological condition and etiology based on 
its morphological (and sometimes functional) features.

Nitrates are metabolized to NO in the body, which in turn 
activates guanylate cyclase to increase cGMP, resulting in 
relaxation of vascular smooth muscle.42,74,194,195 Nitrates also 
suppress the activity of Rho-kinase via NO and thereby relax 
smooth muscle.196 Nitrates exert effects in the treatment of 
coronary spasm by a mechanism of action different from that 
of calcium channel blockers; it is therefore desirable that pa￾tients be treated with the combination of a calcium channel 
blocker and nitrate or monotherapy with either drug alone based 
on the condition of individual patients.

IV Issues Related to Coronary Spasm
1. Intractable Vasospastic Angina
Although attacks of vasospastic angina can usually be relieved 
or suppressed with coronary vasodilators such as nitrates and 
calcium channel blockers, in some patients with vasospastic 
angina is intractable and resists these drugs, and attacks cannot 
be relieved or suppressed. A Ministry of Health, Labour and 
Welfare-commissioned study was undertaken by a research 
task force to determine the incidence of intractable vasospastic 
angina.59 In that study, intractable vasospastic angina was de￾fined as angina that cannot be controlled even with the admin￾istration of two types of coronary vasodilators. According to 
the report, vasospastic angina was found in 921 (40.9%) of 
2,251 patients with angina reported from 15 institutions nation￾wide in Japan; 126 of these patients (13.7%) were intractable. 
The patients with intractable vasospastic angina were charac￾terized by younger age at the time of onset, and included high￾er proportions of tobacco smokers and normotensive patients 
than the group of patients with treatable vasospastic angina.
For patients in whom control of coronary spasm with cal￾cium channel blockers or nitrates is not possible due to the 
complex pathophysiology of coronary spasm, oral drugs with 
different mechanisms of action are required. It is strongly hoped 
that further advances will be made in research into the mecha￾nisms of coronary spasm and the development of prophylactic 
medications.

2. Coronary Spasm and Sudden Cardiac Death
As automated external defibrillators (AEDs) have become 
commonly available, the survival rate of people with out-of￾hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) has increased over time. The 
most common cause of cardiogenic cardiac arrest is acute coro￾nary syndrome due to plaque rupture followed by thrombus 
formation in coronary arteries, but a substantial proportion of 
patients show no organic abnormalities on coronary angiogra￾phy. In an autopsy study of patients with sudden cardiac death, 
the proportion of patients without significant coronary lesions 
was higher in Japan than in Western countries.262
In a multicenter registry study by the Japanese Coronary 
Spasm Association, 35 (2.5%) of the 1,429 patients with vaso￾spastic angina had survived from OHCA. The five-year event￾free survival rate defined as the percentage of patients without 
death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, unstable angina, hospi￾talization due to heart failure, or severe arrhythmia was 72% in 
survivors of OHCA and 92% in patients without the history of 
OHCA, which suggests a history of OHCA is a strong predictor 
of cardiovascular events in patients with vasospastic angina.8
There has been no sufficient evidence regarding the indica￾tion of implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) in pa￾tients who survived from OHCA in whom coronary spasm 
was induced during a provocation test. Physicians should ad￾minister sufficient and reliable medical treatment, and may 
consider the use of ICDs for the secondary prevention of car￾diac arrest as a treatment option for such patients.263–267
3. Coronary Microvascular Spasm
Some possibilities have been suggested regarding the mecha￾nism of onset of myocardial ischemia based on abnormalities 
of the coronary microcirculation. They include (1) steal phe￾nomenon resulting from reduction in coronary microvessel 
diastolic function or uneven vasodilation in the left ventricular 
wall,268 and (2) coronary microvascular spasm.269 In patients 
with microvascular angina, the decreased blood flow and isch￾emia in some regions of the myocardium or subendocardium 
are observed by the pacing stress test, handgrip stress test, or 
adenosine stress test. These types of impairment of metabolic 
vasodilation in the coronary microvessels can cause myocar￾dial ischemia during exercise (effort angina). It is thought that 
if coronary microvascular hypercontraction (spasm) occurs, 
angina not accompanied by an increased myocardial oxygen 
demand, i.e., rest angina, develops.268
Because coronary microvascular spasm cannot be detected 
on angiography, its occurrence must be indirectly detected 
from the results of a provocation test.154,270,271 If symptoms of 
angina are induced despite the absence of spasm in the major 
coronary arteries during a coronary spasm provocation test 
with administration of acetylcholine or ergonovine into the 
coronary arteries, and at the same time direct or indirect find￾ings of myocardial ischemia, such as clear reduction of coro￾nary blood flow rate, emergence of ischemic changes on the 
ECG, and myocardial lactate production, appear, then coro￾nary microvascular spasm is diagnosed.
4. Coronary Spasm After Coronary Artery 
Bypass Grafting (CABG)
During and after CABG, patients are prone to coronary spasm 
because endogenous vasopressor substances are produced as 
a result of anesthesia, surgical invasion, and cardiopulmonary 
bypass; exogenous catecholamine and vasoconstrictors are 
administered; and patients perform voluntary hyperventilation 
before the induction of anesthesia. Furthermore, because he￾modynamics are unstable in the perioperative period, coronary 
spasm can have serious, even life-threatening consequences in 
some cases. Perioperative coronary spasm develops suddenly, 
causing a broad range of signs of myocardial ischemia. Intra￾operative and postoperative coronary spasm tends to be re￾petitive, and is sometimes accompanied by elevated pulmo￾nary arterial pressure; careful monitoring is therefore essential 
with a variety of devices. Because myocardial damage due to 
inadequate cardioplegia and graft blood flow insufficiency also 
lead to signs of myocardial ischemia during surgery, it is nec￾essary to distinguish between these pathological conditions 
and coronary spasm.
In addition to coronary spasm, spasm of the graft itself is a 
potential problem following CABG. The ergonovine provoca￾tion test significantly alters the diameters of great saphenous 
vein grafts, but does not alter those of internal thoracic artery 
grafts.272 In addition, it has been reported that radial artery and 
gastroepiploic artery grafts are more likely to exhibit spasm 
than internal thoracic artery grafts.273
5. Involvement of Coronary Spasm in 
Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is a transient myocardial damage 
of acute onset nature resembling acute coronary syndrome. It 
is characterized by signs/symptoms and ECG findings (such 
as ST elevation, abnormal Q waves, and negative T waves) 
that are resemble those of acute coronary syndrome and acute 
myocardial infarction. It is often triggered with physical or 
mental pain and stress such as medical procedures, and occurs 
at relatively high incidence in elderly people and women. Its 
pathological features include slightly elevated levels of myo￾cardial enzymes, and typical, takotsubo (ampulla)-like wall 
motion abnormalities unrelated to significant coronary stenotic 
lesions, that are observed during the acute phase but improve 
in the chronic phase.
Details of the etiology of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy re￾main unclear. In early reports from Japan188,189 and several 
retrospective studies190–193 of cases subsequently compiled, 
coronary spasm was observed in spontaneous attacks and drug 
provocation tests in the chronic phase of this disease. Al￾though the incidence of coronary spasm in patients with Ta￾kotsubo cardiomyopathy varied between 0~43% in different 
reports,190,192,193,274–276 it is assumed that coronary spasm may 
play an important role in the development of myocardial dam￾age due to Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Coronary lesions that 
are not consistent with abnormal wall motion are observed in 
0~40% of patients with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.190,192,193,274–276
However, Takotsubo cardiomyopathy differs from the com￾mon types of cardiomyopathy due to coronary spasm in path￾ological characteristics, patient characteristics, and causal fac￾tors. Reports from Western countries274–279 have suggested that 
whether coronary spasm is involved in the development of 
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is unclear. The ECG changes in 
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy with wall motion abnormalities 
centered around the apex is different from those in acute myo￾cardial ischemia.280
Although patients with wall motion abnormality in regions 
other than the apex, who account for 15~25% of those with 

Circulation Journal Vol.78, November 2014
JCS Guidelines for VSA 2791
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,281 do not differ from those with 
apical ballooning in terms of patient characteristics, patients 
with repeated wall motion abnormality must be carefully ex￾amined for underlying conditions. In the treatment of Takot￾subo cardiomyopathy, the use of β-blockers should be consid￾ered for patients with persistent hypotension due to functional 
left ventricular outflow tract obstruction.282 Physicians should 
therefore assess patients carefully for possible involvement of 
coronary spasm and exacerbation of it. Patients with a history 
of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy should be followed over time 
as it may recur and cause sudden death, but the efficacy of 
long-term medical treatment in patients with this disease with 
or without coronary spasm has not been demonstrated yet.
6. Coronary Spasm After PCI
Coronary spasm is an important problem that may occur after 
coronary stenting.283,284 It has been reported that excessive 
coronary vasoconstriction of PCI-treated coronary arteries in 
response to intracoronary acetylcholine infusion occur more 
often in patients treated with bare metal stents (BMS) than 
those treated only with balloon angioplasty, and endothelial 
dysfunction was implicated in the reaction.285 After the intro￾duction of drug-eluting stents (DES), the effects of DES on 
endothelial function was investigated in studies using exercise 
tests, pacing stress test, and acetylcholine provocation tests, 
among others. In general, exercise tests and pacing stress tests 
increase coronary flow rate and shear stress, which induce the 
production of NO by the endothelium, and dilate normal ves￾sels and BMS-treated vessels. However, exercise and pacing￾induced vasoconstriction was observed at the edges of DES 
and segments distal to DES.286,287 It has been reported that 
vasoconstriction in segments adjacent to stents in response to 
intracoronary acetylcholine infusion is more severe in DES￾treated vessels than in BMS-treated vessels.288,289 Recent stud￾ies in a porcine model and in patients with coronary artery 
disease have suggested that Rho-kinase, a molecular switch 
that regulates vascular smooth muscle contraction, plays an 
important role in the pathogenesis of coronary dysfunction 
after DES implantation, and that DES induces smooth muscle 
dysfunction as well as endothelial dysfunction.290,291 These 
findings suggest that vascular dysfunction following DES im￾plantation is an important target for clinical intervention.
7. Coronary Spasm in the Perioperative 
Period in Noncardiac Surgery
Since atherosclerotic diseases are increasingly common as con￾sequences of increased life expectancy and changes in life￾style, screening for coronary artery disease before noncardiac 
surgery has become an important preoperative procedure. Cur￾rently, patients are usually screened with symptoms, risk fac￾tors for atherosclerosis, exercise test, stress myocardial scin￾tigraphy, and MDCT. Detailed patient interviews for symptoms 
and careful screening for coronary spasms are especially im￾portant to ensure the safety of patients during the perioperative 
period in noncardiac surgery. In a recent study of 77,745 
consecutive patients who underwent noncardiac surgery in 
Kumamoto University Hospital in Japan, 42 cardiac events (9 
cases of myocardial infarction, 4 cases of fatal arrhythmia, and 
29 cases of unstable angina) developed, and 18 patients had 
vasospastic angina.292 Although vasospastic angina is rare 
among patients in the perioperative period in noncardiac sur￾gery, it may cause significant problems once it occurs. Cardi￾ologists and surgeons must be aware of the risk of periopera￾tive coronary spasm among noncardiac surgical patients, and 
interview and evaluate the patients carefully prior to surgery.
