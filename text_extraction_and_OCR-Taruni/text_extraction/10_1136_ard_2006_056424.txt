Abstract
Objectives: To study potential risk factors for the development of
lung cancer in patients with scleroderma and explore the
chronological relationship between onset of scleroderma symptoms
and subtypes of lung cancer.
Method: Linkage of two population-based registers to identify lung
cancer cases and gender-matched controls with scleroderma,
followed by retrospective case note review for clinical details.
Results: Patients with scleroderma who smoke are seven times
more likely to develop lung cancer than non-smokers (p = 0.008).


Smokers with scleroderma and cancer smoke more than smokers
with scleroderma without cancer (p = 0.019). Pulmonary fibrosis
and anti-topoisomerase antibody do not increase the risk of lung
cancer. Peripheral lung tumours occur earlier after the onset of
scleroderma symptoms than bronchogenic tumours (p = 0.05).
Conclusions: Smokers with scleroderma should be monitored for
the presence of lung cancer and counselled to quit smoking. The
earlier development of peripheral lung tumours is not consistent,
with pulmonary fibrosis being an aetiological factor.
