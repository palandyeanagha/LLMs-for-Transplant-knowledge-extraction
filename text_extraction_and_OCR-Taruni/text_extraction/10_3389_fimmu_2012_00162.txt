Ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury is an inevitable consequence of organ transplantation and
a major determinant of patient and graft survival in kidney transplantation. Renal I/R injury
can lead to fibrosis and graft failure. Although the exact sequence of events in the patho￾physiology of I/R injury remains unknown, the role of inflammation has become increasingly
clear. In this perspective, mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are under extensive investiga￾tion as potential therapy for I/R injury, since MSCs are able to exert immune regulatory and
reparative effects. Various preclinical studies indicate the beneficial effects of MSCs in ame￾liorating renal injury and accelerating tissue repair. These versatile cells have been shown
to migrate to sites of injury and to enhance repair by paracrine mechanisms instead of by
differentiating and replacing the injured cells. The first phase I studies of MSCs in human
renal I/R injury and kidney transplantation have been started, and results are awaited soon.
In this review, preliminary results and opportunities of MSCs in human renal I/R injury are
summarized. We might be heading towards a cell-based paradigm shift in the treatment of
renal I/R injury.

INTRODUCTION
Ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury is the exacerbation of tissue
damage upon reestablishment of circulation after a period of
ischemia. I/R injury is considered a major contributor to tis￾sue damage in multiple clinical situations such as myocardial
infarction, stroke, and organ transplantation. In many clinical
settings, the duration of ischemia is beyond control, and pre￾ventive and therapeutical measures are required to reduce the
extent of I/R injury. Unfortunately, current treatment is primarily
supportive. The pathophysiology of I/R injury is multifacto￾rial and only partially understood. However, the general local
reaction to reperfusion is thought to involve an inflammatory
response that leads to tissue damage. In the quest for new ther￾apeutical options for renal I/R injury, stem cells have come into
play. With their multipotent immune modulating properties they
hold promise to lead to improvement in the treatment of renal
I/R injury.
PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF ISCHEMIA/REPERFUSION INJURY
Although there may be differences in the exact pathophysiolog￾ical mechanisms of I/R injury between different organs, some
processes appear to play a universal role (Eltzschig and Eckle,
2011). The endothelium and microvasculature are very sensitive
to hypoxia and easily affected in I/R injury. Upon reperfusion,
the vascular endothelial cell lining can undergo swelling which
may lead to narrowing of the vascular lumen (Summers and Jami￾son, 1971; Leaf, 1973). Moreover, vasorelaxation can be impaired,
together contributing to the no-reflow phenomenon (Lieberthal
et al., 1989). Endothelial injury can increase microvascular per￾meability which may lead to inflammatory cell recruitment into
the diseased organ. There have been many reports of invading
granulocytes, monocytes, dendritic cells (DCs), and lymphocytes
after reperfusion (Shigematsu et al., 2002; Burne-Taney et al., 2003;
Day et al., 2005, 2006; de Vries et al., 2011).
Together with leukocytes, platelets can be activated by injured
endothelium. In myocardial infarction, platelets mediate throm￾botic occlusion and increase damage by contributing to the
no-reflow phenomenon (Gawaz, 2004). However, platelets are also
able to invade the tissue (Weissmuller et al., 2008). This is essen￾tial since platelets can contribute to the inflammatory response
through release of cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors from
their granules (Reed, 2004; Lisman and Porte, 2010; Thornton
et al., 2010). In fact, platelets have been suggested to be involved in
the inflammatory response of I/R injury in various organs. They
are able to roll and adhere to post-reperfusion endothelium in a
P-selectin-dependent mechanism (Massberg et al., 1998; Sindram
et al., 2000; Khandoga et al., 2002; am Esch et al., 2005). In mouse
myocardial tissue, the first activated platelets are present within
minutes after reperfusion (Xu et al., 2006), and then accumulate
in the infarcted myocardium (Liu et al., 2011).
The ensuing inflammatory response is considered to exacerbate
damage. Both the innate and the adaptive immune system can be
activated after reperfusion. Activation of the innate immune sys￾tem is probably mediated via pattern-recognition receptors such
as toll-like receptors that recognize their endogenous ligands that
are released upon tissue damage (Chen and Nunez, 2010). Besides,
the complement system is part of the humoral immune response
and can play a role both as first line innate defense, but may also
contribute to the adaptive immune response (Dunkelberger and
Song, 2010). In many animal experiments a role for (terminal)

de Vries MSCs in human renal I/R
complement activation in I/R injury has been suggested (Zhou
et al., 2000; Park et al., 2001; de Vries et al., 2003; Zheng et al.,
2008; Zhang et al., 2011), although recent experiments doubt the
involvement of the complement system itself in the initiation of
injury (van der Pol et al., 2012). The role of complement activa￾tion in human I/R injury is even more complex. While in human
myocardial I/R injury a role of complement activation was sug￾gested (Yasojima et al., 1998; Baldwin et al., 1999), the diverse
intervention studies using anti-complement therapy did not lead
to major improvements (Granger et al., 2003; Mahaffey et al., 2003;
Lazar et al., 2004; Verrier et al., 2004; Testa et al., 2008).
Ischemia-related metabolic adaptations and dysregulated mito￾chondrial homeostasis are thought to result in substantial release
of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS) upon reintro￾duction of oxygen. The RONS overload can overwhelm the
endogenous antioxidant system, resulting in oxidative damage.
This may trigger secondary processes and contribute to the pro￾inflammatory response upon reperfusion (Crimi et al., 2006;Valko
et al., 2007; Gourdin et al., 2009; Misra et al., 2009). Numer￾ous animal studies clearly demonstrated that antioxidant therapy
ameliorates I/R injury (Ambrosio et al., 1991; Yellon and Hausen￾loy, 2007; Lakhan et al., 2009). Despite these findings, studies
in humans consistently fail to show any clinically relevant effect
(Land and Zweler, 1997; Bath et al., 2001; El-Hamamsy et al., 2007;
Yellon and Hausenloy, 2007; Suzuki, 2009). The basis for this dis￾crepancy between human and animal studies is still unclear, yet
it may suggest that the contribution of RONS to I/R injury in
humans is less than commonly thought.
Ultimately, when I/R injury to the cell is severe, various pro￾grams of cell death can be activated. There are three major forms
of cell death: necrosis, apoptosis, and autophagy. Besides acute
cell death during and directly after the ischemic period, cell death
continues for several days following reperfusion. All three types
of cell death can contribute to the continued loss of cells for days
and even weeks in the reperfused tissue (Zhao et al., 2000, 2001).
Autophagy during the ischemic episode appears to keep cells viable
and might play a protective role. However, it is suggested that acti￾vation of autophagy after reperfusion is detrimental (Matsui et al.,
2007; Hariharan et al., 2011).
ISCHEMIA/REPERFUSION INJURY IN KIDNEY
TRANSPLANTATION
Ischemia/reperfusion injury is an inevitable consequence of kid￾ney transplantation. Graft survival for living unrelated donation
is superior compared to grafts from brain dead and cardiac dead
donors, although the average human leukocyte antigen (HLA)
matching is worse (Terasaki et al., 1995). Therefore, the poor
graft survival of deceased donor kidneys cannot be exclusively
attributed to differences in immunogenicity. I/R injury can induce
delayed graft function and has a major influence on graft function
and survival (Yarlagadda et al., 2009).
Inflammation is regarded the crucial event in the development
of tissue injury and graft dysfunction in renal I/R injury. Many
individual factors, such as cytokines and complement have been
identified to be involved in the inflammatory response. However,
intervention studies aiming at specific inhibition of a single fac￾tor have generally shown disappointing results (Park et al., 2001;
de Vries et al., 2009). Cooperation, redundancy, and interac￾tions play a role and mechanisms appear to be more complex
than previously thought. Pharmacological inhibition of the entire
inflammatory cascade would appear a logical intervention, how￾ever, the negative side effects appear larger than the anticipated
beneficial effects (Morariu et al., 2005).
ISCHEMIA/REPERFUSION INJURY: LONG-TERM IMPACT
Although short-term results of kidney transplantation are excel￾lent, 5 year graft loss can be up to 30% in older recipients (Keith
et al., 2006). Protocol biopsies obtained in the first years after
transplantation have shown interstitial fibrosis/tubular atrophy
(IF/TA). This finding has been correlated with later allograft dys￾function and loss (Nankivell et al., 2003; Park et al., 2010). Both
allogen dependent and independent factors determine IF/TA. I/R
injury is an important non-allogeneic factor and the duration of
the cold ischemic period is directly correlated to delayed graft
function and even allograft failure (Ojo et al., 1997; Salahudeen
et al., 2004). I/R injury itself, without allogeneic transplantation,
has been shown to cause interstitial fibrosis and glomerulosclero￾sis in experimental models (Tullius et al., 1994; Herrero-Fresneda
et al., 2000; Basile et al., 2001; Figure 1).
RENAL REPAIR
In recent years, it has become clear that in response to kidney injury
not only fibrotic repair but also restoration of damaged kidney tis￾sue can occur. This has been best established for acute kidney
injury, where surviving resident tubular epithelial cells dedifferen￾tiate and subsequently re-enter the cell cycle to replace the necrotic
tubular epithelium. Dedifferentiated cells outside the injured kid￾ney may also migrate to the site of injury within the kidney. Kidney
biopsies in male recipients of a female donor kidney with acute
tubular necrosis showed presence of the male Y chromosome in
renal tubular cells. No Y chromosome staining was seen in patients
without acute tubular necrosis. This provides evidence that extra￾renal cells participate in renal regeneration (Poulsom et al., 2001;
Gupta et al., 2002).
The call for better treatment strategies for I/R injury has
directed research toward more encompassing cellular-based thera￾pies, particularly aimed at the use of stem cells. The multi-factorial
pathophysiology of I/R injury makes a pharmacological agent that
has a single mechanistic target less likely to be therapeutically effec￾tive. In contrast, stem cells are versatile, and able to target a whole
cascade of repair mechanisms simultaneously and successively,
thereby improving organ protection and repair.
MESENCHYMAL STROMAL CELLS
Of all bone marrow (bm)-derived cells, mesenchymal stromal cells
(MSCs) hold special promise in attenuating kidney injury, since
nephrons are largely of mesenchymal origin and stromal cells are
of crucial importance for signaling leading to differentiation of
both nephrons and collecting ducts. MSCs are characterized by
three main criteria: (1) The ability to differentiate into osteoblasts,
adipocytes, and chondroblasts in vitro, (2) the expression of sur￾face makers CD73, CD90, and CD105, and lack of expression
of haematopoietic markers including CD34 and CD45, and (3)
plastic adherence in culture (Dominici et al., 2006).

Long-term structural damage and fibrosis were assessed. I/R injury

kidney function partially recovered. Sirius red staining shows (A) normal
mouse kidney and (B) severe fibrosis 3 weeks after the mouse underwent
25 min of warm renal I/R injury (Representative images, unpublished
data).
Mesenchymal stromal cells have the ability to secrete numerous
growth factors and cytokines that collectively stimulate mitogene￾sis, inhibit apoptosis, and modulate immune responses. They can
alter cytokine secretion profiles of T cells (Krampera et al., 2003),
DCs, and natural killer cells to induce a more anti-inflammatory or
tolerant phenotype (Aggarwal and Pittenger, 2005; Stagg, 2007).
These immune modulating effects could be achieved both with
autologous and allogeneic MSCs.
An important aspect of the effect of MSCs is their ability to
home to areas of injury or inflammation. Exogenously admin￾istered MSCs can engraft into various injured structures in the
kidney (Ninichuk et al., 2006; Herrera et al., 2007; Wong et al.,
2008). Recently, studies have shed light on the exact factors that
facilitate homing of MSCs. Amid them, CD44 and hyaluronic acid
interactions, and stromal-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) and CXCR4
interactions may be crucial in recruiting exogenous MSCs to
injured renal (Togel et al., 2005b; Herrera et al., 2007).
SOURCES OF MSCs
While initially isolated from the bm, MSCs have now been identi￾fied within most tissues and are thought to represent a perivascular
cell population involved in normal tissue homeostasis (Crisan
et al., 2008). Indeed, MSCs have been isolated from adipose
tissue, umbilical cord (uc) blood, placenta, and various organs
(Zuk et al., 2002; Morigi et al., 2004; Toma et al., 2005; da Silva
et al., 2006; Hoogduijn et al., 2006). Recently, MSCs have also been
isolated from the human and mouse kidney. In mice these cells
were extensively compared to bmMSCs (Pelekanos et al., 2012).
Transcriptome and immunophenotype analysis of the renal MSC￾like populations supported strong congruence with bmMSCs.
Future studies need to elucidate whether regeneration and func￾tional repair can be enhanced via the resident renal stem cells.
In the meantime, bmMSCs are the best characterized popula￾tion and currently more than 200 clinical trials are ongoing using
bmMSCs1.

MSCs AMELIORATE RENAL ISCHEMIA/REPERFUSION
INJURY IN VIVO
Although MSCs most probably do not replace damaged cells,
evidence on beneficial effects of MSCs in renal I/R injury is
accumulating in animal experiments. Intravenous injection of
bm-derived lineage-negative pluripotent cells after experimen￾tal renal I/R significantly attenuated the creatinine rise (Duffield
et al., 2005). Peripherally administered purified MSCs significantly
attenuated functional and histological damage (Furuichi et al.,
2012). Even when administered 24 h or later after I/R injury, MSCs
still were able to ameliorate damage and fibrosis (Lange et al., 2005;
Togel et al., 2005a; Donizetti-Oliveira et al., 2012). In experimen￾tal renal allograft transplantation MSCs decreased inflammation
(Hara et al., 2011).
Different studies have reported beneficial effects of human
MSCs on acute repair in the kidney (Morigi et al., 2006). The
therapeutic potential of human bmMSCs was studied in immun￾odeficient NOD-SCID mice. Infused human bmMSCs reduced
renal cell apoptosis and increased proliferation after cisplatin￾induced acute renal failure. bmMSCs also preserved the integrity
of the tubular epithelium and peritubular vessels, and prolonged
survival (Morigi et al., 2008). In search for new sources of MSCs
for renal repair, human ucMSCs were shown to ameliorate both
renal dysfunction and tubular cell injury, and prolong survival in
cisplatin-induced acute kidney injury (Morigi et al., 2010).
The mechanism of MSC-induced kidney repair has been
the subject of numerous studies. There is growing evidence
that the process of transdifferentiation is probably not rele￾vant to renal repair in vivo. The primary means of these cells
most likely involve paracrine and endocrine effects; includ￾ing mitogenic, anti-apoptotic, anti-inflammatory, antifibrotic,
and angiogenic influences (Figure 2; Ninichuk et al., 2006).
The factors that mediate the paracrine effects are obviously
of great interest. Several factors that are abundant in MSC￾conditioned medium have been mentioned (Togel et al., 2007).
Recently, it was suggested that microvesicles released from MSCs
may account for this paracrine mechanism. Administration
of isolated microvesicles from human MSCs indeed protected

rats from acute ischemic kidney injury (Bruno et al., 2009;
Gatti et al., 2011).
CLINICAL APPLICATIONS OF MSCs IN RENAL DISEASE
There are only limited clinical data about MSC therapy in renal
disease. The first safety and feasibility data of autologous MSC
administration in the week after kidney transplantation were pub￾lished in 2011 (Perico et al., 2011). Although data are limited to
two patients, MSC infusion appeared feasible and restricted mem￾ory T cell expansion while enlarging Treg population. However,
both patients showed transient increase in serum creatinine levels
within 2 weeks after cell infusion that might be related to intragraft
recruitment of granulocytes, suggesting that timing of infusion
is of particular importance (Ortiz et al., 2003; Fang et al., 2004;
Lange et al., 2005). This is probably related to the necessity for the
appropriate micro-environment to allow MSCs to acquire their
anti-inflammatory properties. In addition, in a recent study the
use of autologous MSCs resulted in lower incidence of acute rejec￾tion, decreased risk of opportunistic infection and better estimated
renal function at 1 year compared with anti-IL-2 receptor anti￾body as induction therapy (Tan et al., 2012). In our clinical trial
we investigate safety and feasibility of autologous bmMSC treat￾ment in patients with subclinical rejection and/or IF/TA in the
renal biopsy at 4 weeks or 6 months after renal transplantation
(Clinical trials NCT00734396). Hereby we expect to provide
additional information about the importance of timing in the
transplant setting.
AUTOLOGOUS VERSUS ALLOGENEIC MSCs
Until now, most studies have focused on the use of autologous
cells since allogeneic cell transplantation may promote allograft
rejection and possibly sensitization (Nauta et al., 2006; Stagg
et al., 2006). However, autologous MSCs also have disadvantages.
The cells need weeks of culture and a concern for the use of
autologous MSCs includes their potential dysfunction due to the
underlying disease. Few studies have reported influence of renal
failure on MSC behavior. In mice, functional incompetence of
MSCs was reported under uremic conditions (Noh et al., 2012).
In addition, in human MSCs it was shown that uremic serum
induced an osteoblast-like phenotype in MSCs accompanied
by matrix remodeling and calcification (Kramann et al., 2011).
In contrast, it was recently shown that human adipose tissue￾derived MSCs are not affected by renal disease (Roemeling-van
Rhijn et al., 2012).
MSC NUMBER, ROUTE OF ADMINISTRATION, AND INTERACTION
WITH IMMUNOSUPPRESSIVES
Alongside the cell source, the number of MSCs and the timing of
administration are critical. In most clinical trials doses of 0.4 to
10 × 106/kg body weight were used (Lazarus et al., 2005; Le Blanc
et al., 2008; Macmillan et al., 2009). However, no clear correlations
have been made between cell dose and clinical effect. Dose esca￾lation studies to monitor safety and efficacy are one of the major
objectives for future studies of MSCs.
Mesenchymal stromal cells have been administered intra￾venously in most human trials. Other possible successful routes
of administration include intra-arterial or intra-renal infusion
(Kunter et al., 2006, 2007; Ding et al., 2009). An advantage of these
routes may be the direct administration at the place of injury,
whereas disadvantages include the complexity and possible side
effects such as obstruction of capillaries. To date, there are no
reports of these treatment modalities in humans.

de Vries MSCs in human renal I/R
Current immunosuppressive drugs cannot be withheld from
patients receiving MSC treatment after renal transplantation.
Therefore, it is of importance that an optimal concurrent
immunosuppressive regimen is chosen in which drugs have no
negative impact on MSC function and vice versa. So far, this inter￾action has mainly been assessed by in vitro studies (Maccario et al.,
2005; Prevosto et al., 2007) and future studies are needed to eluci￾date their interaction with concurrent immunosuppression in vivo
in order to facilitate successful translation to the clinic.
POSSIBLE HURDLES OF MSC TREATMENT
Although cell therapy with MSCs holds enormous promise for
the treatment of many diseases, unwanted side effects of MSC
infusions must be assessed with the greatest care. Experimen￾tal studies have demonstrated maldifferentiation after injecting
MSCs directly into damaged tissue (Breitbach et al., 2007; Kunter
et al., 2007). In addition, MSCs may adopt and unwanted,
myofibroblast-like phenotype after administration (Wu et al.,
2003; di Bonzo et al., 2008). Another important concern is that
MSCs may differentiate into neoplastic cells or may cause promo￾tion of tumor cell growth (Djouad et al.,2003; Karnoub et al.,2007;
Tolar et al., 2007), although an increased risk of tumor forma￾tion has never been confirmed in humans (Centeno et al., 2010).
Currently, more than 2000 patients have been treated with
allogeneic or autologous MSCs worldwide for a variety of diseases
and so far no major side effects have been reported. However, still
little is known about long-term side effects.
SUMMARY
The pathophysiology of I/R injury is complex and characterized
by inflammation, leading to tissue injury and graft dysfunc￾tion. Given current shortage of donor organs and usage of
marginal donor kidneys for transplantation, novel treatment
options to minimize renal I/R injury are urgently needed. Recent
developments in stem cell research and derived clinical stem
cell therapies have given reason to believe that such cell-based
treatments will become generally available in the near future.
Although substantial additional time for the maturation of these
therapies for routine clinical use is needed, the first steps of MSC￾based therapeutic strategies in the treatment of I/R injury have
been taken.
