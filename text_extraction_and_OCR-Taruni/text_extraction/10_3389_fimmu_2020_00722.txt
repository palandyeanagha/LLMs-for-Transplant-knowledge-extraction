Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HCT) holds curative potential
for many hematological disorders. However, the pathophysiology of the desired graft￾versus-tumor effect is linked to life-threatening complications of acute graft-versus-host
disease (GVHD). Allogeneic donor T lymphocytes are essential for causing GVHD, and
their activation relies on the coordination of TCR engagement and co-stimulation, also
known as Signal 1 and Signal 2. In addition to these signals, a network of secreted
cytokines by immune cells provides a third signal, Signal 3, that is critical for the
initiation and maintenance of GVHD. Strategies to target Signal 3 in human diseases
have shown therapeutic benefit for inflammatory disorders such as Rheumatoid Arthritis
and Inflammatory Bowel Disease. However, despite our growing understanding of their
role in GVHD, the success of targeting individual cytokines has been modest with some
notable exceptions. This review aims to describe current approaches toward targeting
Signal 3 in clinical GVHD, and to highlight emerging studies in immune cell biology that
may be harnessed for better clinical translation.

INTRODUCTION
Acute Graft-versus-Host Disease (GVHD) is a major cause of non-relapse morbidity and mortality
in patients receiving allo-HCT. While the development of GVHD is dependent on numerous
factors, the HLA major and minor antigen-induced activation of donor-derived T cells is the
key determinant for induction and severity of GVHD (1). T cell activation occurs as a result of
the engagement of three signals (2, 3). Signal 1 is provided by the T cell receptor with cognate
peptide:HLA, and Signal 2 follows the engagement of T cell co-stimulatory receptors by cognate
ligands on antigen presenting cells (2). Interaction with both antigen and co-stimulatory ligands is
critical for initiating the intracellular signaling cascade that promotes T cell proliferation, survival,
and effector functions, and therefore a number of approaches aim to target these steps in the
prevention and treatment of GVHD (4–6). In addition to these two signals, Signal 3 which is
provided by surrounding cytokines controls the differentiation of T helper (Th) subsets, influences
the polarization of specific T effector responses, and shapes the balance between immune activation
and tolerance (3, 7, 8).
The cytokine milieu in patients following bone marrow transplantation is complex, and includes
both immune cell and target tissue sources. It is released following conditioning treatments and

amplified by tissue destruction from T cell-mediated lysis (9).
In both experimental models of allo-HCT and patients affected
by GVHD, the cytokines that provide Signal 3 significantly
impact the alloreactive T cell response (10). Selectively targeting
the cytokines that promote alloreactive T cells is therefore an
attractive therapeutic strategy.
Many existing therapies for GVHD are aimed at targeting
donor T cells or inflammatory byproducts of immune cells
which contribute to symptoms and pathology. However, donor
T cells are also critical for the graft-versus-tumor (GVT) effect,
and as such, balancing therapies has been a challenge to
preserve sufficient GVT activity while minimizing GVHD-related
tissue damage. One strategy has been to target the cytokines
that promote alloreactive T cell toxicity and also cause direct
inflammation-related organ damage. While the success of these
approaches has been modest thus far, a growing basic science
understanding of relevant cytokines, the regulation of cytokine
secretion, and the specific impact each has on immune and
target cells will inform future strategies for the prevention and
treatment of GVHD.
Several outstanding recent articles have reviewed the biology
and the important role of cytokines in both acute and chronic
GVHD (10–13). In this review, we will only highlight cytokines
that serve as Signal 3 to T cells (Figure 1) and have been
targeted in clinical acute GVHD. Specifically, we will first briefly
review approaches that directly target Signal 3 secreted cytokines,
the majority of which have been targeted upon their release
extracellularly (i.e., post-synthesis and release, in the extracellular
space). We will then focus on therapies that target the induction
of cytokine synthesis intracellularly in immune cells, focusing on
specific cell signaling pathways that lead to cytokine synthesis
(i.e., pre-synthesis by targeting intracellular signaling cascades).
Finally, we will review an as yet understudied area to target the
cytokines following their synthesis intracellularly, including post￾translational pathways, and the intracellular trafficking pathways
that regulate their release. We will discuss why understanding the
pathways by which these cytokines are transported intracellularly
may represent an effective approach toward the rational design
of GVHD therapies.
DIRECT T CELL INTRINSIC CYTOKINES
AND PROLIFERATIVE RESPONSES
Strategies to control donor T cell activity begin with broadly
acting anti-inflammatory prophylactic agents. The most widely
used approaches today include methotrexate in combination with
cyclosporine or tacrolimus. Methotrexate, a folate antagonist, can
target rapidly proliferating allogeneic T cells and be cytotoxic
to their growth. Cyclosporine and Tacrolimus inhibit the
calcineurin-dependent activation of NFAT transcription factors
and their translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus,
reducing the transcription of inflammatory cytokines such as IL￾2 and IFNγ by T cells. Targeting the immune response at this level
inhibits key T effector functions as well as their proliferation.
While instrumental in reducing GVHD risk, however,
standard prophylaxis measures are not completely effective in
preventing the onset of GVHD. Furthermore, they confer non￾specific anti-inflammatory functions that can increase the risk
of tumor relapse and infection. Systemic glucocorticoids which
remain the mainstay of first-line treatment of acute GVHD is
also broadly immunosuppressive. However, T cells are responsive
to the influence of select cytokine signals which promote their
growth, proliferation, cytotoxicity, and secretion of effector
molecules. Important signals include cytokines that promote
inflammation and which also tend to be increased following
conditioning and allo-HCT such as IL-12, IL-4, IL-1, TNFα, and
IL-6 (14, 15). Therefore, agents that attenuate the cytokine signals
that promote the overactivity of T cells could be beneficial in
GVHD treatment. While all of these cytokines have been shown
to be critical sources of Signal 3, agents that block TNF, IL-6, and
IL-1, as well as the T cell-derived growth factor IL-2 have been
studied as potential modes of treatment in acute GVHD. There
remains active interest in the use of specific anti-inflammatory
cytokine blockade including agents that directly target activating
cytokine signals to T cells extracellularly.
EXTRACELLULAR SIGNAL 3 BLOCKADE
Anti-TNF
Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) is a cytokine that acts on multiple
immune cell types, and promotes the production of other Signal
3 cytokines including IL-1 and IL-6 (16). Overexpression of TNF
is implicated in the development of multiple autoimmune and
inflammatory disorders, and its blockade has improved disease
management and quality of life for patients with rheumatoid
arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, and others (17). In addition
to innate immune cell-derived TNFα, T cell-derived TNFα is
implicated in the development of GVHD in experimental murine
models, and in humans, it has been observed that early increased
serum levels of TNFα are associated with major transplant￾related complications (18, 19). TNFα levels are initially increased
following conditioning treatments as measured by levels of TNF
receptor-1 which correlate with those of plasma TNFα (20,
21). TNFα is appreciated to play direct roles in acute GVHD
pathogenesis by both effecting direct tissue damage and by
promoting allogeneic T cell cytotoxicity (22). Therefore, the use
of neutralizing anti-TNFα agents has been studied for efficacy in
GVHD prevention and treatment. One such agent is infliximab,
an anti-TNFα monoclonal antibody that has been studied in
prophylaxis, and treatment of steroid-refractory acute GVHD
(SR-aGVHD) (23, 24). However, in patients with SR-aGVHD,
the addition of infliximab did not improve survival and instead
increased post-transplant risk of infection when compared to
treatment with corticosteroids alone (24, 25). Clinical trials have
also been performed to test the efficacy of etanercept for the
blockade of soluble TNF. However, early results were not borne
out by a multi-center randomized study that demonstrated no
impact of etanercept on GVHD or on overall survival, infection,
and relapse of the primary malignancy (26–30). While TNFα
is best known for its inflammatory properties in promoting T
cell effector responses, its dual role as a suppressive cytokine
is increasingly being appreciated with the characterization of

Kim and Reddy Targeting Signal 3 in GVHD
FIGURE 1 | Signal 3 pathways that are targeted in graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Signal 3 critically shapes the allo-response, and existing treatment options
have the potential to modulate the cytokine milieu that accompanies allogeneic T cell activation. Current treatment strategies include (a) blockade of cytokines

cytokines. (c) The pathways that regulate cytokine secretion following their synthesis but preceding their release have not been therapeutically targeted.
functionally disparate TNF receptors and their actions on
different cell types such as T regulatory cells (Tregs) (31). While
the vast majority of current therapies target TNF directly, future
studies of specific inhibitors of TNF production, signaling, and
oligomerization, may clarify their potential in the treatment
of GVHD (17).
Anti-IL-6
IL-6 is a member of a family of cytokines that shares the receptor
complex gp130, a widely expressed signaling complex that leads
to the activation of associated Janus kinase (JAK) and signal
transducer and activation of transcription (STAT) pathways.
Levels of circulating IL-6 can increase dramatically in settings of
inflammation, and consequently, IL-6 is associated with the acute
phase inflammatory response (32). The biological consequences
of IL-6 are wide-ranging and include the pathologic stimulation
of proinflammatory responses, such as by promoting Th17 cell
development and inhibition of regulatory T cell differentiation
(33). In murine models of GVHD, donor T cell-derived IL￾6 critically contributes to disease severity, and donor T cell￾specific deficiency of IL-6 decreases GVHD-related mortality
(34). Blockade of the IL-6 signaling in experimental models also
improved GVHD survival and led to an increase in regulatory T
cells, and decreased Th1 and Th17 cells in target organs while

preserving GVT effects (34, 35). A clinical study examining
the effect of tocilizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody
against the IL-6 receptor, showed favorable outcomes in a small
number of patients with either acute or chronic GVHD (36).
A phase I/II clinical trial further studied the effect tocilizumab
administered 1 day prior to allogeneic peripheral blood stem
cell transplantation in patients that received cyclosporine and
methotrexate as GVHD prophylaxis (37). A phase II trial in which
patients received busulfan-based conditioning prior to receiving
tocilizumab with tacrolimus and methotrexate showed a low
incidence of gastrointestinal GVHD (38). Recently, a phase III
randomized and double-blinded trial observed a trend toward
a reduced overall incidence of grade II-IV GVHD in patients
receiving tocilizumab, but no difference in long term survival
compared to controls (39).
Anti-IL-1
In addition to TNF and IL-6, IL-1 is an inflammatory
cytokine that is increased following conditioning and is critical
for immune homeostasis, but when dysregulated, potentiates
GVHD pathology (10). Although small early studies showed
that targeting soluble IL-1 with a recombinant human IL￾1 receptor or administration of a recombinant IL-1 receptor
antagonist could ameliorated SR-aGVHD, these results were not
confirmed in a randomized controlled trial (40–42). Given its
known potency in inflammatory disorders and association with
GVHD in both experimental models and humans, strategies that
target IL-1 may be effective depending on the phase of acute
and/or chronic GVHD (43, 44). Key upstream regulators of
IL-1 include intracellular immune sensors NLRP3 and NLRP6,
which assemble into inflammasomes in settings of cellular
damage and stress such as those induced by pre-transplant
conditioning therapies. Following allogeneic transplant in
experimental models, NLRP3 inflammasomes induced the
secretion of pathogenic levels of IL-1β by multiple intestinal
cellular sources, and also controlled the IL-1β-dependent skewing
of Th17 differentiation critical to the development of GVHD
(44). By contrast, donor myeloid derived suppressor cells,
which have immunoregulatory functions in GVHD, can lose
suppressive capacity following activation of the inflammasome
(45). Thus, the cellular source is an important determinant of
the impact of inflammasome dependent effects on GVHD. In
host non-hematopoietic target tissues, NLRP3 inflammasomes
serve a protective role in promoting intestinal epithelial cell
integrity and repair by increasing IL-18 secretion (46). NLRP6,
which has protective roles in intestinal colitis, plays a role in
aggravating gastrointestinal GVHD when expressed in host-non￾hematopoietic tissue, and its absence in host intestinal epithelial
cells helps maintain gut homeostasis following allogeneic BMT in
experimental models (47). It is likely that the effects mediated by
NLRP6 may be IL-1 independent or dependent depending on the
type of immunopathology.
Anti-IL-2
IL-2 expression is increased upon activation, is released by
T cells, and serves as a growth factor for T effector cells
and Tregs. IL-2 is one of the earliest cytokines to be studied
as a target for immunosuppression therapeutically (48–50).
Intracellular targeting of the production and secretion of IL￾2 with calcineurin inhibitors remains the first line prophylaxis
strategy in the prevention of GVHD. Studies have also explored
the use of monoclonal antibodies against IL-2 receptor including
daclizumab, basiliximab, and inolimomab, to target the activity
of secreted IL-2. One randomized trial found that the addition
of daclizumab to corticosteroids as an initial therapy for acute
GVHD resulted in increased GVHD-related mortality (51).
A phase II study found that while treatment of SR-aGVHD
with daclizumab led to an increased complete response rate,
it was associated with higher rates of long-term complications
of chronic GVHD (52). Although basiliximab appears to be
better tolerated by patients and not associated to the same
degree of adverse events in initial studies, future studies are
needed to determine its safety and efficacy (53–55). Targeting
IL-2 is nuanced by its dual roles, as in addition to promoting
the T cell-mediated toxicity in GVHD, it is essential for the
development and maintenance of Tregs which are important
regulators of immune tolerance, and may in turn be employed in
the prevention of GVHD (56–60). Therefore, efforts to target IL-2
must balance its inflammatory and immunoregulatory effects that
minimize GVHD but still prevent relapse of the primary disease.
The administration of low-dose IL-2 is of interest in the treatment
of chronic GVHD, and has been associated with expansion of
Tregs, suppression of conventional T cell proliferation, and long￾term reduction of chronic GVHD symptoms (61–63).
TARGETING THE INTRACELLULAR
AFFERENT ARM OF SIGNAL 3
CYTOKINE RELEASE
Following their activation, T cells engage distinct signaling
pathways that lead to the increased synthesis of important
effector molecules including cytokines and cytotoxic factors.
These culminate in a pro-inflammatory milieu that shapes
the allogeneic T cell response and also causes direct tissue
damage. While targeting cytokines following their release by
immune cells is gaining increasing interest for their promising
outcomes in both experimental models and clinical trials, there
has been renewed interest in targeting earlier steps following
T cell activation such as the intracellular signaling pathways
that increase cytokine production. Therapeutic strategies have
included targeting the intracellular signaling pathways that
lead to proinflammatory cytokine transcription and translation
with agents such as calcineurin inhibitors as described above,
mTOR inhibitors, JAK inhibitors, Alpha-1 Antitrypsin, histone
deacetylase inhibitors, and proteasome inhibitors.
mTOR Inhibition
The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway is a major
regulator of cellular growth and metabolism that is also critical
for T cell activation, differentiation, and function (64). Sirolimus,
an inhibitor of mTOR, has been demonstrated to exhibit anti￾inflammatory effects through multiple mechanisms including
inhibition of both conventional T cell and dendritic cell activity,

Kim and Reddy Targeting Signal 3 in GVHD
and promotion of Treg development (65–67). Early studies
showed that sirolimus can be well tolerated in patients and may
be associated with a lower risk of GVHD (68, 69). A prospective
randomized trial found that in combination with tacrolimus,
sirolimus is a safe alternative to cyclosporine and methotrexate
for GVHD prophylaxis (70). A recent phase III trial reported
that the addition of sirolimus to cyclosporine and mycophenolate
mofetil for prophylaxis showed efficacy in lowering the incidence
of GVHD (71). However, its efficacy as a therapy for SR-aGVHD
in combination with other agents may be limited depending on
the stage of GVHD, and warrants further studies (72).
JAK1/2 Inhibition
T cells are responsive to inflammatory cytokines including
IL-6 and interferons via their propagation of JAK/STAT
pathways. Activation of the JAK family of proteins leads to
the phosphorylation of STATs, which translocate to the nucleus
and are critical regulators of T cell alloreactivity (73). Pre￾clinical models demonstrated that targeting JAK1/2 targets
GVHD but preserves GVL, with the contribution of decreased
serum levels of proinflammatory cytokines including IL-6 (74–
76). This led to testing the effects of JAK inhibitors such as
ruxolitinib, baricitinib, and itacitinib. Ruxolitinib, a selective
inhibitor of JAK1/2, in patients with SR-aGVHD. In an early
study, six patients experienced reduced GVHD in correlation
with a decrease in proinflammatory cytokines in the serum (75).
Additional clinical trials are underway to examine the effects of
ruxolitinib in patients with SR-aGVHD (77). Itacitinib, a selective
JAK1 inhibitor, has also demonstrated safety in a phase I trial
and studies of its efficacy in the treatment of SR-aGVHD are
ongoing (78).
Alpha-1 Antitrypsin
Alpha-1 Antitrypsin (AAT) is an endogenously circulating serine
protease inhibitor that, when deficient or mutated, has been
described in the pathogenesis of disorders including COPD,
cirrhosis, and multiple neurodegenerative diseases (79). In
addition, AAT has a suppressive role in inflammatory settings
with an appreciable inhibitory effect on TNF levels (80, 81).
When AAT is administered in models of murine allo-HCT, it has
been shown to reduce GVHD-induced mortality while preserving
the allogeneic T cell GVL effect (82–84). The therapeutic benefit
in these models has been linked to a decrease in alloreactive
effector T cells and inflammatory cytokines, and an increase
in Tregs and immunoregulatory cytokines such as IL-10 (84).
AAT is an effective modulator of the profile of circulating
cytokines following allo-HCT leading to significantly reduced
disease murine models, underscoring the therapeutic potential
of AAT and strengthening the rationale for studying the effect
of AAT therapy in humans. Recent studies showed complete
recovery in 4 of 12 patients and improvement in the other 8
patients with SR-aGVHD (85). A prospective multi-center study
that followed tested AAT as a first line therapy for SR-aGVHD
led to an overall response rate of 65% and complete response
rate of 35% by day 28 (86). Ratios of T effector cells and Tregs
were consistent with those observed in experimental models (86).
Both studies found that AAT is well tolerated by patients, is not
associated with an excessive risk of infection, and are now being
studied in a randomized manner in a phase III study.
Histone Deacetylase Inhibition
Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors represent a diverse class
of drugs that cause reversible inhibition of HDAC enzymes,
remodel chromatin structure, and differentially modify gene
expression depending on the specific HDAC, cell type, and
context. A clinically significant consideration of HDAC inhibitors
is that in addition to acting on histones, they can have non￾specific effects on other protein deacetylases that broadly regulate
cell growth and signaling (87). However, at non-cytotoxic doses,
HDAC inhibitors have recently been appreciated to be well
tolerated and exhibit immunoregulatory properties, lending
to growing interest in their potential to treat inflammatory
diseases (88). Among their diverse effects, HDAC inhibitors
have shown immunomodulatory effects on dendritic cell and
macrophage antigen presentation, TLR pathways, and IFN
signaling (88). As a consequence, they can reduce the expression
of cytokines involved in Th1 and Th17 differentiation such as
IL-6 and IL-12 (89, 90). In experimental models of GVHD,
HDAC inhibition has been observed to lead to reduced
secretion of proinflammatory cytokines including IL-12, IL-6,
and TNFα by dendritic cells through enhancing the expression
of indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase (91–93). Two phase II clinical
trials have examined oral HDAC inhibitor vorinostat in the
prevention of GVHD. One study investigated the addition of
vorinostat to tacrolimus and mycophenolate in patients that
received reduced intensity conditioning prior to related donor
hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (94). Another study
tested the effect of vorinostat when combined with tacrolimus
and methotrexate following myeloablative conditioning prior
to unrelated donor allo-HCT (95). Both studies showed that
vorinostat is well tolerated and associated with a lower incidence
of acute GVHD (94, 95). A third study is ongoing to
evaluate vorinostat as preventive therapy in adolescents and
young adults receiving allogeneic BMT when combined with
standard preventive therapy (NCT03842696). Future studies
will elucidate the clinical benefit of HDAC inhibitors including
vorinostat, as well as other agents such as panobinostat that
are more recently being evaluated as primary therapy for acute
GVHD (96).
Proteasome Inhibition
The ubiquitin proteasome pathway is central to the selective
of maintenance of proteins, and regulates a diverse set of
intracellular processes including quality control for misfolded
proteins, regulation of the cell cycle, and peptide processing
for antigen presentation (97). In immune cells, the proteasome
is also involved in cell signaling, notably by regulating the
expression of NF-κB, a transcription factor that promotes cell
survival and the expression of numerous inflammatory cytokines
(98). Proteasome inhibitors have thus emerged as a drug
class that is associated with a number of immunomodulatory
effects, and is currently approved for the treatment of a
number of hematologic disorders (99). Proteasome inhibitors
have been shown suppress NF-κB activation, in part due to

Kim and Reddy Targeting Signal 3 in GVHD
the reduction of proteasome-dependent degradation of IκB
(100, 101). The inhibition of NF-κB is associated with reduced
proliferation, survival, and toxicity of allogeneic T cells, and
has also been shown to abrogate T cell cytokine production
(102, 103). In addition to its effect on T cells, proteasome
inhibitors such as bortezomib have suppressive effect on
dendritic cell maturation and inflammatory cytokine production,
while increasing dendritic cell apoptosis, highlighting their
influence on multiple processes and cell types (104). In
murine models of acute GVHD, treatment of recipients with
bortezomib led to increased survival and protection from
GVHD while maintaining GVT activity (105, 106). However,
the timing of bortezomib administration may be critical
in determining its efficacy as well as its overall safety, as
delayed administration (i.e. 5 or more days after BMT)
compared to 0 to 3 days following BMT results in increased
gastrointestinal toxicity. This mechanistically correlates in
other studies with amplified IL-1β production by dendritic
cells (107, 108). While an early phase I/II study to test a
prophylaxis regimen of bortezomib combined with tacrolimus
and methotrexate showed that this combination was well
tolerated and associated with a lower incidence of GVHD, a
randomized controlled trial failed to show an improvement
in grade II-IV acute GVHD incidence with the addition of
bortezomib, compared to methotrexate and tacrolimus alone
(109, 110). Another proteasome inhibitor ixazomib improves
acute GVHD upon early administration, impairs dendritic
cell development, cytokine production, and expression of co￾stimulatory molecules consistent with reduced proliferation of T
cells, and clinical trials are underway to determine its efficacy in
post-transplant patients (111).
TARGETING THE INTRACELLULAR
EFFERENT ARM OF SIGNAL 3
CYTOKINE RELEASE
The majority of pre-clinical studies have provided the
foundation for the development of therapies that target
cytokines or cytokine receptors directly, or the signaling
pathways that govern their transcription and translation.
A gap in knowledge remains, however, in the post￾translational intracellular pathways that coordinate the
transport mechanisms that regulate cytokine release by
immune cells. Multiple transport steps coordinate the
membrane biogenesis, transport, and fusion events that
carry cytokines between intracellular compartments and
toward the cell surface for secretion. Better understanding of
these intracellular secretory pathways utilized by cytokines
in immune cells may provide important insights into novel
therapeutic targets.
The post-Golgi Apparatus Transport of
Cytokines
In the classical secretory pathway, proteins are co-translationally
inserted into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and transported to
the Golgi compartment where they undergo further processing
and are delivered to other intracellular compartments, or the
extracellular space. Activated T cells undergo morphologic
changes that affect intracellular cytokine transport by first
establishing polarity and forming immune synapses with
antigen presenting cells. A dynamic cytoskeleton enables T cells
to both adhere to the APC, and transport secretory vesicles
containing cytokine cargoes (112). CD8+ T cells engaged
with cognate APCs reorient their microtubule organizing
center toward the immunological synapse, and transport
secretory granules along microtubules toward the point of
cell-cell contact for targeted lysis of the APC (113). CD4+
T cells remain less well characterized in their regulated
secretory pathways than CD8+ T cells. However, distinct post￾Golgi pathways have been elucidated, including a directional
pathway that directs cytokines toward the immunological
synapse and minimizes non-specific cytokine release, and
a multi-directional pathway to promote more generalized
inflammation (114). Studies to elucidate the molecular
mediators of regulated T cell secretion may enable novel
approaches toward controlling targeted cytokine release in
disease states. These studies and others underscore that in
addition to cytokine expression, regulation of the membrane￾bound organelles that transport them significantly impact the
consequences of T cell activation. However, to date, studies
have been limited to understanding the secretory pathway of
cytokines through events that occur after their egress from the
Golgi apparatus.
Targeting Early Intracellular Phases of
the Efferent Arm of Signal 3 Release
About one-third of encoded proteins are estimated to be
targeted to the ER and destined for the secretory pathway
(115, 116). Coat Protein Complex II (COPII), a complex of
five highly conserved proteins (Sec23/Sec24, Sec13/Sec31, and
Sar1), assembles at the ER membrane and forms vesicles that
incorporates proteins for transport to the Golgi compartment,
including many secreted proteins (Figure 1). The molecular
components of COPII were first described in Saccharomyces
cerevisiae (117, 118), and COPII-mediated ER-Golgi transport
is conserved in all eukaryotes including humans (119). As
our understanding of the COPII-dependent secretory pathway
increases, the characterization of cell- and context-specific
activities and regulation of protein secretion will be critical.
Fundamental gaps remain in our knowledge about the role of
the early secretory pathway in specific cytokine secretion, and
the relevant molecular regulators of this process by immune
and other cells. Recently, we have begun to decipher the role
of the COPII pathway in the release of cytokines by T cells.
We observed that disrupting COPII coat formation by targeting
SEC23 results in greatly reduced pathogenicity of donor T
cells in experimental models of GVHD (120). Future studies
on how the COPII pathway regulates secretion of critical
Signal 3 cytokines may further shed light on immune cell
secretory pathways and provide insight into potential novel
therapeutic targets.

Kim and Reddy Targeting Signal 3 in GVHD
Targeting the Timing of Signal 3 for
Mitigating GVHD
Cytokine secretion and its downstream effects are dynamic and
context dependent. Signal 3 cytokines are typically studied and
understood as discussed above in the context of APC activation
and induction of T cell response. The role of signal 3 in the
perpetuation of an ongoing T cell response is unclear. Based on
the known data the timing of targeting signal 3, it may be critical
for mitigating GVHD. Specifically, given its role in induction
of allogeneic T cell response, it may be more effective to target
signal 3 in prevention strategies for either incidence of GVHD
or in preventing steroid-refractoriness following onset of severe
GVHD. However, because cytokine cascades and inflammatory
responses may wax and wane, the exact timing will need to be
carefully determined experimentally and in clinical studies.
CONCLUDING REMARKS
The relevance of cytokines that serve as Signal 3 for robust
T cell responses is increasingly well established in their role
in promoting GVHD, and as promising therapeutic targets.
However, current approaches have yielded modest success and
additional strategies are warranted. Moving forward, identifying
shared intracellular trafficking pathways that control cytokine
release may be of value in developing newer approaches to target
Signal 3. Basic science research on the fundamental and critical
determinants of intracellular trafficking pathways that coordinate
their release remain to be understood. With a better mechanistic
understanding of these pathways, the identification of key
molecular mediators in the allogeneic setting will be essential.
Exploring these questions will both enhance our fundamental
understanding of immune regulation, and may pave the way for
controlling T cell immunity in inflammatory disorders.
