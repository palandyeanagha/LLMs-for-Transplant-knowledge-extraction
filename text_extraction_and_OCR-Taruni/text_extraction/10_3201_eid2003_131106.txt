Three recently sequenced strains isolated from pa￾tients during an outbreak of Mycobacterium abscessus
subsp. massiliense infections at a cystic fibrosis center in
the United States were compared with 6 strains from an 
outbreak at a cystic fibrosis center in the United Kingdom
and worldwide strains. Strains from the 2 cystic fibrosis out￾breaks showed high-level relatedness with each other and 
major-level relatedness with strains that caused soft tissue
infections during an epidemic in Brazil. We identified unique
single-nucleotide polymorphisms in cystic fibrosis and soft
tissue outbreak strains, separate single-nucleotide polymor￾phisms only in cystic fibrosis outbreak strains, and unique
genomic traits for each subset of isolates. Our findings
highlight the necessity of identifying M. abscessus to the 
subspecies level and screening all cystic fibrosis isolates
for relatedness to these outbreak strains. We propose 2 di￾agnostic strategies that use partial sequencing of rpoB and 
secA1 genes and a multilocus sequence typing protocol.
Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) and, in particular, 
the Mycobacterium abscessus group are recognized as 
emerging respiratory pathogens among patients with cystic 
fibrosis. Reports from the United States, France, and Israel 
have shown that the M. abscessus group accounts for a ma￾jor proportion of NTM infections in patients with cystic 
fibrosis; prevalence rates range from 16% to 48% (1–3).
Previous studies have indicated great diversity within 
M. abscessus group strains among cystic fibrosis patients, 
suggesting independent acquisitions of NTM from the en￾vironment (2,4). However, suspicion of patient-to-patient 
transmission arose with the recent report of an outbreak of 
respiratory infection with M. abscessus subsp. massiliense
at a cystic fibrosis center in Seattle, Washington, USA (5). 
The index case-patient and 4 additional patients all had 
multidrug-resistant isolates with resistance to amikacin 
and clarithromycin. All 5 strains were indistinguishable by 
repetitive unit sequence–based PCR patterns and pulsed￾field gel electrophoresis analysis, which led to initiation 
of whole-genome sequencing. In a separate, recent study, 
whole-genome sequencing and epidemiologic analysis pro￾vided strong support for patient-to-patient transmission in 
2 clustered outbreaks of M. abscessus subsp. massiliense at 
the Papworth Hospital Cystic Fibrosis Centre (Cambridge, 
UK) (6). Isolates from both clusters showed resistance to 
clarithromycin, and isolates from one of the clusters also 
had mutations conferring resistance to amikacin.
The availability of whole-genome sequences from dif￾ferent M. abscessus subsp. massiliense outbreaks, as well 
as unrelated strains, provides an unprecedented opportunity 
for multigenome comparisons. We conducted a genomic 
study of 3 recently sequenced strains from the Seattle cystic

Relatedness among M. abscessus subsp. massiliense Strains
fibrosis outbreak, including the index strain, and compared 
them with representative strains from the Papworth cystic 
fibrosis outbreak, as well as with available strains from the 
United Kingdom, the United States, Brazil, South Korea, 
France, and Malaysia (Table 1). We found high-level relat￾edness among strains from the 2 geographically distant out￾breaks in Seattle and Papworth. We also identified shared 
and unique genomic traits for strains from both cystic fibro￾sis outbreaks and for those from an outbreak of soft tissue 
infections in Brazil.
Materials and Methods
Sequence Analysis of Outbreak Strains
A subset of 6 isolates (2u, 12c, 14h, 19f, 20h, and 28c) 
representing the breadth of genomic diversity observed 
within the Papworth cystic fibrosis outbreak clusters 1 
and 2 (6) were selected. Illumina sequencing reads from 
each of these isolates were assembled into sets of contigs 
by using Velvet software (21). These contigs were com￾bined with draft genome sequences of the Seattle cystic fi￾brosis outbreak and available whole-genome sequences of 
M. abscessus subsp. massiliense (Table 1) and subjected 
to whole-genome multiple sequence alignments by using 
Mugsy software (22). Core segments of the alignment that 
are shared among all isolates included in the analysis were 
identified and concatenated by using Phylomark software 
(23). Concatenated nucleotide sequences, including single￾nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), were then used for con￾struction of a neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree by using 
MEGA software (24). The use of microbial samples and 
data was approved by the ethics committees at each of the 
institutions involved.
To replicate data from the Papworth cystic fibrosis out￾break clusters 1 and 2 (6) by using a similar approach, we 
mapped sequencing reads from the subset of 6 Papworth 
isolates, together with reads with from the 3 Seattle cys￾tic fibrosis isolates and soft tissue strain CRM-0020 from 
Brazil (Table 1), onto the M. abscessus type strain ATCC 
19977T reference genome by using BWA software (25). 
Variants, including SNPs, were called by using GATK 
software (26) and filtered for quality. The SNP panel was 
used for construction of a neighbor-joining phylogenetic 
tree by using MEGA software. The resulting tree replicated 
the topology of clusters 1 and 2 and showed that the Seattle 
isolates are most closely related to cluster 2.
PCR and In Silico PCR
Standard PCR and sequencing strategies were used to 
amplify and analyze partial sequences of the rpoB (723 bp) 
(27,28) and secA1 (465 bp) (29) genes. In addition, a mul￾tilocus sequence typing (MLST) scheme (29,30), including 
primers to 13 housekeeping genes (cya, gdhA, argH, glpK, 
gnd, murC, pgm, pknA, pta, pur, rpoB, hsp65, and secA1) 
was used to conduct electronic PCR on the panel of 20 M. 
abscessus subsp. massiliense genomes (Table 1). Published 
forward primers for cya and gdhA (30) did not amplify in 
silico for some M. abscessus subsp. massiliense strains; 
therefore, the following new primers conserved across the 
M. abscessus group were used: cya_F_new 5′-GCC TGC 
GTA AGG GTG ATG-3′ and gdhA_F_new 5′-GTG AAG 
CTC GCC GCC TGC-3′. Alleles from each gene were

Results
Phylogenetic Characteristics of Outbreak Strains
A core genome phylogenetic tree (Figure 1) showed a 
tight cluster of the 3 Seattle cystic fibrosis outbreak strains. 
The Seattle cystic fibrosis cluster was closely related to the 
2 cystic fibrosis clusters described for the Papworth out￾break (6) and the Birmingham, UK, cystic fibrosis isolate 
47J26 (9). Furthermore, the Seattle and Papworth cystic fi￾brosis outbreak strains showed some relatedness to strains 
CRM-0020 and GO-06 derived strains (known collectively 
as BRA-100) isolated during an epidemic of soft tissue in￾fections in Brazil (32) and the M. abscessus subsp. massil￾iense M18 strain from Malaysia (10).
The cumulative size of core segments of Mugsy align￾ments provides information on relatedness among groups 
of strains compared. The core genome reduces in size as 
more genomes are added; an expected major decrease oc￾curs after addition of more distant strains to the group. The 
average genome size of cystic fibrosis outbreak strains was 
4.81 Mb for Seattle (n = 3) and 4.97 Mb for Papworth (n 
= 6). The Seattle and Papworth cystic fibrosis outbreak 
strains (n = 9) shared a core genome of 4,264,844 nt, which 
is almost unchanged by including the Birmingham cystic 
fibrosis strain 47J26 (n = 10; 4,264,127 nt). Addition of the 
soft tissue outbreak strain CRM-0020 from Brazil (n = 11) 
(32) decreased the core to 4,231,390 nt, and adding the re￾lated outbreak strain GO 06 from Brazil (n = 12) (8,33), led 
to an additional decrease in the core genome to 4,043,718 
nt. As expected, including unrelated available clinical M. 
abscessus subsp. massiliense strains (n = 20, including 
M139 with ambiguous subspecies taxonomic assignment 
(12), (Table 1), reduced the core genome size to 3,869,950 
nt. Further addition of M. abscessus subsp. abscessus (n = 
2) and M. abscessus subsp. bolletii (n = 2) genomes (Table 
1) reduced the core to 3,828,656 nt.
Genomes of Strains from Cystic Fibrosis and 
Soft Tissue Infection Outbreaks
The core genome of 10 strains representing the Pap￾worth cystic fibrosis (n = 6), the Seattle cystic fibrosis (n = 
3), and soft tissue CRM-0020 (n = 1) outbreaks comprised 
4,231,390 nt. Strain GO 06 was excluded from the analysis 
because its genome harbors a large number of ambiguous 
nucleotides and an unusual hybrid appearance with frag￾ments of M. abscessus subsp. massiliense and M. absces￾sus subsp. abscessus sequences. Strains 47J26 and M18, 
isolated from the sputum of a cystic fibrosis patient in Bir￾mingham, UK, and a lymph node sample from a patient in 
Malaysia, respectively, were related to the outbreak strains

SNPs, single-nucleotide polymorphisms.

Relatedness among M. abscessus subsp. massiliense Strains
(Figure 1). However, no information was available about 
any epidemiologic link between cystic fibrosis strain 47J26 
to reported or unpublished outbreaks, and no clinical infor￾mation was available about the patient from whom strain 
M18 was isolated. Therefore, both strains were excluded 
from the SNP analysis. Nevertheless, SNPs for these 
3 strains at positions relevant to the outbreak strains are 
shown in the Technical Appendix (wwwnc.cdc.gov/EID/
article/20/3/13-1106-Techapp1.xlsx).
A total of 293 identical SNPs in the core segments of 
Mugsy alignments were shared by the 10 outbreak strains 
but were different in available M. abscessus subsp. mas￾siliense strains not related to outbreaks (Figure 2; online 
Technical Appendix). Of the 293 SNPs, 95 gave rise to 
nonsynonymous mutations in several genes, including 
virulence factors (mammalian cell entry and yrbE pro￾teins), transcriptional regulators (TetR family), and lipid 
metabolism genes (online Technical Appendix). Eleven 
SNPs were shared only by Papworth and Seattle cystic fi￾brosis outbreak strains (n = 9), including nonsynonymous 
mutations in the preprotein translocase secA1 and a puta￾tive lyase (Figure 2; online Technical Appendix). Sixteen 
SNPs were shared only by the 3 Seattle cystic fibrosis 
outbreak strains, including nonsynonymous mutations in 
a mycobacterial large membrane protein (MmpL) family 
involved in lipid transport and virulence (34) and genes 
involved in amino acid and energy metabolism (Figure 2; 
online Technical Appendix). Eighty-six SNPs were pres￾ent only in strain CRM-0020 (soft tissue outbreak) from 
Brazil, including nonsynonymous mutations in an MmpL 
family protein; transcriptional regulators; and lipid, ami￾no acid, and energy metabolism genes (Figure 2; online 
Technical Appendix).
Having shown high-level relatedness among Papworth 
and Seattle cystic fibrosis outbreak strains and their related￾ness to the soft tissue outbreak strains from Brazil, we also 
searched for genomic regions ≥200 nt outside the core ge￾nome that were specific to subsets of isolates. A single re￾gion of ≈11.5 kb was unique to the Papworth cystic fibrosis 
isolates (n = 6) and encompassed 2 conserved hypothetical 
proteins, 2 phage integrase family proteins, and an MmpL 
family protein. Alignment of the MmpL family protein with 
distinct MmpL proteins described above for the Seattle cystic 
fibrosis outbreak and the Brazil soft tissue outbreak showed 
diversity at several amino acid residues in all 3 proteins.
No region was unique to the Seattle cystic fibrosis iso￾lates (n = 3). The soft tissue isolate CRM-0020 from Brazil 
harbored several large unique regions, including a previ￾ously described broad–host-range IncP-1β plasmid (35) and 
3 regions (contigs) of 5 kb, 10.6 kb, and 79 kb of unknown 
origin encoding almost exclusively hypothetical proteins.
We also searched for polymorphisms associated with 
macrolide and aminoglycoside resistance. The Papworth 
cystic fibrosis and Seattle cytic fibrosis outbreak set of 
strains showed an A2058C/G mutation in 23S rRNA, which 
conferred macrolide resistance (36) (A2058G in strains 2u 
and 28c representative of Papworth cluster 2 and the Seattle 
strains). Strains 19f, 14h, 12c, and 28a, representative of 
Papworth cluster 1, and Seattle strains shared the A1408G 
mutations in 16S rRNA, which conferred aminoglycoside 
resistance (37). None of these mutations were found in the 
soft tissue outbreak strains CRM-0020 and GO 06 from Bra￾zil or the M18 strain.
Diagnostic Tools for Identification of Outbreak Strains
In light of the possibility of a common ancestor and/
or intercontinental transmission of strains, we identified 
SNPs in genes commonly used for identification of my￾cobacteria and an MLST scheme that could be used by 
clinical laboratories to assess relatedness of newly iso￾lated strains to this global cluster. In the first approach, 
we retrieved rpoB sequences from the 6 genomes of 
representative strains of the Papworth cystic fibrosis 
outbreak and performed partial sequencing of the rpoB
gene for selected isolates from the Seattle cystic fibrosis 
outbreak. We then compared these sequences with those 
of isolates from the outbreak in Brazil and unrelated clini￾cal isolates comprising M. abscessus subsp. abscessus, 
massiliense, and bolletii, as well as other rapidly growing 
mycobacteria.

RESEARCH
By using the rpoB gene MAB_3869c from the M. ab￾scessus subsp. abscessus type strain as a reference (Table 
2) described in the BRA-00 outbreak isolates from Brazil 
(32,33), we showed that Seattle (n = 4) and Papworth (n = 
6) cystic fibrosis isolates carried the 2 rpoB SNPs (C→T at 
position 2569 and T→C at position 2760. However, none 
of the M. abscessus subsp. abscessus or subsp. bolletii or 
other rapidly growing mycobacterial isolates outside the 
M. abscessus group harbored this 2-SNP rpoB signature 
(Table 2). The second SNP (T→C substitution at position 
2760) was present in several strains, but the combination 
of both rpoB SNPs (C→T at position 2569 and T→C at 
position 2760) was not present. Most of the 26 M. absces￾sus subsp. massiliense strains not related to outbreaks test￾ed did not harbor this 2-SNP rpoB signature. However, 4 
strains harbored this signature (Table 2) (29,38).
Multiple alignment of rpoB sequences among avail￾able M. abscessus subsp. massiliense genomes showed the 
absence of the 2-SNP rpoB signature in most strains. How￾ever, both SNPs were present in 1 strain not related to an 
outbreak (1S-151–0930) (Table 2).
Multiple alignment of secA1 sequences among avail￾able M. abscessus subsp. massiliense genomes showed 
a G→T substitution at position 820 (by using the secA1
gene MAB_3580c from the M. abscessus subsp. absces￾sus type strain) shared by the Papworth and Seattle cystic 
fibrosis outbreak strains but not by the soft tissue outbreak 
strains from Brazil or additional unrelated strains. Fur￾ther analysis of secA1 sequences from 12 M. abscessus
subsp. massiliense identified by multitarget sequencing 
and PCR-based typing (29,38) showed a G→T substitu￾tion at position 820 in 2 strains unrelated to the outbreak 
(Table 2). Those 2 strains were included among the 4 
strains that had the 2-SNP rpoB signature. Although the 
SNPs described for rpoB and secA1 were not 100% spe￾cific markers for the outbreak strains, these SNPs could be 
used for first-level identification of newly isolated strains 
as possibly being related to cystic fibrosis clusters or soft 
tissue outbreak strains from Brazil to be confirmed by a 
second assay.
We also developed a simple MLST protocol that could 
be used as a second confirmatory assay. Alleles for each 
of 13 housekeeping genes (cya, gdhA, argH, glpK, gnd, 
murC, pgm, pknA, pta, pur, rpoB, hsp65, and secA1) were 
extracted and concatenated for each M. abscessus subsp. 
massiliense genome (Table 1), and the panel of concatenat￾ed sequences was used for construction of a neighbor-join￾ing phylogenetic tree by using MEGA software. The Se￾attle and Papworth cystic fibrosis outbreak strains grouped 
together in the tree with cystic fibrosis strain 47J26 and iso￾late M18 from Malaysia (Figure 3). Thus, partial sequenc￾ing of rpoB and secA1 gens, followed by 13-target MLST 
analysis, could be used to rule out isolates as belonging to 
these 2 cystic fibrosis clusters.

Relatedness among M. abscessus subsp. massiliense Strains
Discussion
The implications of this study are extensive. Currently, 
most experts recommend identifying isolates of M. absces￾sus to subspecies level (39). This report further corrobo￾rates these recommendations and places even greater pres￾sure on clinical laboratories to fully identify M. abscessus
subspecies massiliense.
Strains from the 2 cystic fibrosis outbreaks showed 
high-level relatedness (4,264,844 nt core genome align￾ment size, 11 shared unique SNPs) with each other and 
major-level relatedness (4,231,390 nt core genome align￾ment size) with soft tissue epidemic strains from Brazil. 
Genomic features shared between strains from all 3 out￾breaks might make them more transmissible, whether 
from patient to patient (directly or indirectly as in cystic 
fibrosis outbreaks) or from a common source, as in soft 
tissue infections. However, the soft tissue strain from 
Brazil had the largest number of unique SNPs (86) not 
shared with either of the cystic fibrosis outbreak strains, 
harbored an IncP-1β plasmid, and did not show muta￾tional resistance to amikacin or clarithromycin. We spec￾ulate that some of these specific genomic traits may be 
favorable for the successful establishment of epidemic 
soft tissue infections.
A previous study did not detect a common source or 
person-to-person transmission of the M. abscessus group 
among cystic fibrosis patients and suggested that it may 
not be necessary to segregate persons infected or colo￾nized with M. abscessus from those who are not infected 
or colonized (40). Our findings emphasize the necessity of 
screening all isolates of M. abscessus subsp. massiliense
recovered from patients with cystic fibrosis for relatedness 
to outbreak strains in an effort to prevent future outbreaks. 
Because of evidence supporting patient-to-patient trans￾mission of multiple different respiratory tract organisms, 
the Infection Control Guidelines (currently in draft form 
for public comment) of the United States Cystic Fibrosis 
Foundation (CFF) (www.cff.org/LivingWithCF/Webcasts/
ArchivedWebcasts/Germs/#Infection_Prevention_and_
Control_Policy_Update) have been recently changed. Pa￾tients with cystic fibrosis are advised not to attend indoor 
meetings with other cystic fibrosis patients (CFF and Infec￾tion Prevention and Control Guidelines 2013). In addition, 
screening of all cystic fibrosis patients in the United States

Figure 3. Neighbor-joining phylogenetic
tree based on 13-target multilocus
sequences types from 20 Mycobacterium 
abscessus subsp. massiliense genomes. 
Electronic PCR was performed on the M. 
abscessus subsp. massiliense genomes 
listed in Table 1 by using primer pairs
for 13 housekeeping genes (cya, gdhA, 
argH, glpK, gnd, murC, pgm, pknA, pta, 
pur, rpoB, hsp65, and secA1), including
new primers designed as part of this study. 
Nucleotide sequences from each gene
were concatenated for each genome and 
aligned by using ClustalW (31), and the
core alignment was used for construction 
of a midpoint-rooted neighbor-joining
phylogenetic tree by using MEGA (24).
Strains from an outbreak of M. abscessus
subsp. massiliense infections at a cystic 
fibrosis center in Seattle, Washington,
USA, are indicated in red; strains from 
an outbreak of M. abscessus subsp. 
massiliense infections at a cystic fibrosis
center in Papworth, UK, are indicated
in blue (cluster 1) and purple (cluster
2); strains from Brazil are indicated in
magenta; and the M. abscessus subsp. 
massiliense type strain is indicated in 
green. The longer branch length for 
Papworth isolate 12c was caused by
low-quality nucleotides (single-nucleotide
polymorphisms [SNPs]) located at the
edge of Velvet contigs.

RESEARCH
at least annually for mycobacteria is now recommended 
(CFF and Infection Prevention and Control Guidelines 
2013) to enable early treatment if the organism is detected.
It remains unclear why intercontinental organisms 
are so closely related. One hypothesis is that direct patient 
contact led to transmission. The Seattle index case-patient 
traveled to British Columbia, Canada, before and after ac￾quiring mycobacterial infection, to Oregon before myco￾bacterial infection, and to Atlanta, Georgia, and Bethesda, 
Maryland, after mycobacterial infection. However, the pa￾tient did not report any contact with other cystic fibrosis 
patients at these destinations. A second hypothesis is that 
the mycobacterial strain could have been carried by per￾sons with cystic fibrosis who were clinically well. A third 
hypothesis is that there was an independent selection of M. 
abscessus subsp. massiliense clones in the cystic fibrosis 
airway milieu on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean toward 
potentially more transmissible lineages. Availability of ad￾ditional whole-genome sequencing data tracking the global 
epidemiology of the M. abscessus group may help differ￾entiate between these scenarios. In addition, this data will 
help delineate global clusters of M. abscessus subsp. mas￾siliense strains with potentially higher transmissibility.
Addendum
Recent whole-genome data show deep genetic sepa￾ration of 3 subspecies, ruling against grouping M. massil￾iense and M. bolletii under M. abscessus subsp. bolletii.
