SUMMARY
Hepatic steatosis is a common histological feature of chronic hepatitis C. Various factors are
associated with hepatic steatosis, including obesity, high alcohol consumption, diabetes type II,
and hyperlipidaemia. These factors may contribute to steatosis in patients with chronic hepatitis
C. In humans, hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 3 is more commonly associated with steatosis. In
vitro studies and the transgenic mouse model have suggested that the HCV core protein (genotype
1) can induce lipid accumulation within hepatocytes.
However, what is the relevance of steatosis in chronic hepatitis C? It seems that in certain
populations, steatosis may be associated with fibrosis progression and this may be genotype
specific. The mechanisms underlying this association are unknown; neither is it clear whether
this holds true for all patients or only a subgroup. Indeed, after antiviral treatment, virus related
steatosis disappears whereas the host associated steatosis remains unaffected.
This review describes and discusses the basic and clinical aspects of the relationship between
steatosis and progression of fibrosis, and response to treatment in patients with chronic hepatitis C.
c INTRODUCTION
HCV is a major cause of chronic liver disease with about 170 million people infected worldwide.
The severity of disease varies widely from asymptomatic chronic infection to cirrhosis and
hepatocellular carcinoma.
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) represents a spectrum from simple steatosis at one
end to severe inflammation with extensive fibrosis or cirrhosis at the other. Hepatic steatosis
without inflammation is thought to have a good prognosis but non-alcoholic steatohepatitis
(NASH) can progress to cirrhosis in a significant proportion of cases.
Hepatic steatosis is also a common histological feature of chronic hepatitis C but may be
independently associated with obesity, high alcohol consumption, type II diabetes, and
hyperlipidaemia and, when these occur, may contribute to steatosis in patients with chronic
hepatitis C. In this review we will focus on the relevance of steatosis in patients with chronic
hepatitis C with respect to disease outcome.
FREQUENCY OF STEATOSIS IN CHRONIC HEPATITIS C PATIENTS IN COMPARISON
WITH THE GENERAL POPULATION
Hepatic steatosis can develop secondary to obesity, diabetes mellitus, alcohol abuse, protein
malnutrition, total parenteral nutrition, acute starvation, drug therapy, carbohydrate overload,1–7
and chronic hepatitis C infection. An excellent review of lipid metabolism has been published
elsewhere (fig 1).5 Estimates based on imaging and autopsy studies suggest that approximately
20–30% of adults in the USA and other Western countries have excess fat accumulation in the
liver1–2; approximately 10% of these individuals (that is, 2–3% of adults) are estimated to have
NASH. Wanless and Lentz found steatosis in 70% of obese and 35% of lean patients in a
consecutive autopsy study.8 The prevalence of steatosis in patients with abnormal liver tests (in
which known causes of liver disease have been excluded) is 64%; of these 50% had steatosis and
50% had steatohepatitis.9
In chronic hepatitis C patients, the prevalence of steatosis ranges from 40% to 86% (mean
,55%) (table 1).10–23 The majority of patients with steatosis (78%) have mild steatosis affecting
less than 30% of hepatocytes. Thus steatosis occurs more frequently in patients with chronic
hepatitis C (55%) than in the general population (20–30%) of adults in the Western world.2

a high body mass index (BMI) has been reported (table 2).
Adinolfi et al reported that overall, steatosis was not
significantly associated with BMI, but when analysis was
done by single genotype, a significant association was shown
between high visceral fat distribution and grade of steatosis
in HCV genotype 1 patients (but not in genotype 3).14 This led
to the idea that in patients with HCV infection there is a
‘‘metabolic fat’’ (especially in patients with HCV genotype 1)
and a ‘‘viral fat’’ (especially in patients with genotype 3).
Epidemiological studies have suggested a link between type 2
diabetes and chronic HCV infection.24–28 However, the
presence of confounding factors such as obesity, aging, or
cirrhosis precludes the establishment of a definite relation￾ship between these two conditions.

STEATOSIS, HCV GENOTYPE 3, AND VIRAL
REPLICATION
Several studies have observed a significant association
between HCV genotype 3 infection and the presence of
steatosis (table 1). In our study, including 290 chronic
hepatitis C patients, steatosis, in multivariate analysis, was
associated with HCV genotype 3 infection, higher BMI, and a
higher grade of necroinflammation.21 Thus steatosis is more
frequent in HCV genotype 3 than in HCV genotype 1 infected
patients. Steatosis is present in 73% of patients infected with
genotype 3 and in 50% of patients infected with genotypes
other than 3 (table 1).10–23 The mechanisms underlying this
genotype specific steatosis are unknown. We have recently
shown that HCV genotype 3 is associated with higher
quasispecies heterogeneity than genotype 1.29 Serum levels
of apolipoprotein B and cholesterol are reduced in patients in
whom steatosis responds to antiviral therapy.15 Thus the
disappearance of steatosis correlates with normalisation of
apolipoprotein B and cholesterol levels. Hypochol￾esterolaemia in patients with chronic hepatitis C (especially
genotype 3) has been reported by others.20 30 These observa￾tions suggest that HCV may interfere with secretion of very
low density lipoprotein (VLDL), which is corrected by
antiviral therapy.
A significant correlation was observed between steatosis
and high titres of intrahepatic negative strand HCV RNA in
patients infected with HCV genotype 3, indicating that
steatosis may be secondary to a viral cytopathic effect.13 In
two studies in patients with HCV genotype 3, an association
between grade of steatosis and serum HCV RNA levels was
observed.14 20 However, other studies have not confirmed
this.31
Experimental models: demonstration that HCV can
induce steatosis
In vitro studies and the transgenic mouse model have both
suggested that the HCV core protein is sufficient to induce
lipid accumulation in hepatocytes. In cell culture, at least two
HCV proteins, core and NS5A, are suspected to interact with
the cell machinery involved in lipid metabolism.32 33 However,
the role of NS5A (if any) seems to be confined to cells
coexpressing the HCV core. These proteins interact with
apolipoproteins A1 and A2, which are likely involved in
triglyceride accumulation and storage in the hepatocytes.
Both the core and NS5A proteins are localised on the surface
of lipid droplets. Overexpression of core protein further
stimulates the formation of lipid droplets.
In transgenic mice it has been reported that HCV core
protein inhibits microsomal triglyceride transfer protein
(MTP) activity.34 As this is a rate limiting enzyme playing a
key role in the VLDL assembly, the direct and likely
consequence of its inactivation is accumulation of unsecreted
triglycerides, hence steatosis.34 Direct interaction with MTP is
unlikely as it would require secretion of the core protein into
the endoplasmic reticulum lumen which has not been
reported. However, MTP inhibition may still be indirect.
One disadvantage of the mouse model is that mice made
transgenic with the HCV core protein have normal apolipo￾protein B levels in serum.15 A potential indirect effect of the
HCV core on the VLDL secretory pathway may be brought
about by the non-specific effect of reactive oxygen species
(ROS).35 It has been shown that the HCV core protein causes
mitochondrial injury, leading to oxidative stress. These
effects were prevented by a mitochondrial electron transport
inhibitor.35 Thus it seems that, at least in this model, the core
protein of HCV may cause oxidative injury as a result of its
localisation and direct toxic effect on mitochondria. Thus
HCV transgenic mice have increased sensitivity to oxidative
stress, and increased hepatic lipid peroxidation occurs in
response to carbon tetrachloride.36 Increased production of
ROS may cause peroxidation of membrane lipids and
structural proteins (such as those involved in trafficking
and secretion).
Thus there is evidence that HCV proteins can cause
steatosis in the absence of an immune response. However,
all of these models used constructs derived from genotype 1
isolates. For this reason, we have established an in vitro
model of expression of the HCV core protein of several
different types (from 1 to 5), and our preliminary data show

that the core proteins from both genotypes 1b and 3a share
the capability of inducing accumulation of triglycerides in
Huh-7 hepatoma cells, although genotype 3a is much more
efficient.37 These results raise the issue of which factors, other
than the HCV core protein, may induce steatosis observed in
humans. In particular, the role of other viral proteins should
be properly investigated.
DOES STEATOSIS AFFECT THE PROGRESSION OF
THE DISEASE?
Limitations of published studies
Published data on the influence of steatosis in chronic
hepatitis C have several limitations. Firstly, only limited
studies are available, almost all being cross sectional or
retrospective. Histological criteria for fatty liver disease may
be different and the populations studied may have different
risk factors for steatosis. For example, in a study from the
USA, mean BMI was 28.5 kg/m2 and 32% of patients were
obese,16 whereas in our study (France), mean BMI was
24 kg/m2 and only 8% of patients were obese.21 Moreover, the
HCV genotype distribution differs from region to region. For
example, genotype 3 is more frequent in Europe (24%) than
in the USA (14%).16 22
Experimental models: steatosis and fibrosis
development
In animal models, such as the leptin deficient ob/ob mouse or
the leptin receptor deficient mouse (db/db) and rat (fa/fa),
there is very marked hepatic steatosis but little steatohepa￾titis or fibrosis.38 Development of steatohepatitis in these
models depends on additional factors, such as endotoxin
exposure, acute liver injury (for example, ischaemia-reperfu￾sion), alcohol, excess dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids, or
aging. A unifying hypothesis envisages that all causes capable
Figure 2 Pathogenesis of liver fibrosis in chronic hepatitis C. Proposed mechanisms leading to steatosis and fibrosis in hepatitis C virus (HCV)
infection. Steatosis may be caused directly by HCV core protein expression (with or without the cooperation of other viral proteins) but other
mechanisms are likely, such as the hyperglycaemic/hyperinsulinaemic state, the hallmark of insulin resistance (where HCV may play an additional
direct role through activation of cytokines), and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (again, possibly induced by HCV and by insulin
resistance). Furthermore, steatosis renders hepatocytes more insulin resistant and, on the other hand, provides the fuel for amplifying the production of
ROS. Fatty accumulation, however, is not fibrogenic per se. The production of ROS may provide a pathogenetic link between steatosis and fibrosis.
ROS induce cytokines formation by hepatocytes (tumour necrosis factor a (TNF-a), transforming growth factor b (TGF-b), interleukin 8 (IL-8), and
FasLigand (FasL)). TGF-b activates collagen synthesis by stellate cells while IL-8 is a potent chemoattractant for human neutrophils. ROS trigger lipid
peroxidation, which releases malondialdehyde (MDA) and 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE). MDA and HNE also increase collagen synthesis by stellate cells
while HNE is a potent chemoattractant for human neutrophils. Additional fibrogenetic stimuli are represented by the fibrogenic inflammatory cytokines
(released as part of both innate and adaptive immune responses to HCV infection and antigen expression) and by the direct profibrogenic effect of
hyperinsulinaemia.

of changing the redox equilibrium of the hepatocyte may
result in liver inflammation and fibrogenesis activation. For
example, ROS may promote hepatic stellate cell activation
and collagen fibre deposition.39 Lipid peroxidation products,
such as 4-hydroxy-2,3-nonenal, may elicit activation and
nuclear translocation of c-Jun N-terminal kinases, upregulate
c-Jun and increase AP-1 binding, all of which may lead to
procollagen type I overexpression.40 Furthermore, these
phenomena are efficiently prevented by antioxidants.39
Direct involvement of HCV in the development of
insulin resistance
A prominent mechanism linking steatosis and fibrogenesis is
insulin resistance. The molecular cause of insulin resistance,
a major factor in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes, is
unknown. Several papers have suggested an association
between chronic hepatitis C and type 2 diabetes.24–28 This is
relevant as prolonged hyperglycaemia results in several
metabolic changes that are of interest in liver fibrogenesis
and recent studies show indeed a close correlation between
the degree of insulin resistance and extent of fibrosis.41–42
Recently, it was shown that glucose tolerance was impaired
in a mouse model transgenic for the HCV core gene, with
plasma glucose levels being higher at all time points,
including in the fasting state, although the difference was
not statistically significant.43 Transgenic mice exhibited
marked insulin resistance, as revealed by the insulin
tolerance test, as well as significantly higher basal serum
insulin levels. Feeding with a high fat diet led to the
development of overt diabetes in transgenic mice but not in
control mice. Moreover, there were increased levels of
tumour necrosis factor a (TNF-a) in the liver of HCV core
gene transgenic mice. High levels of TNF-a have also been
observed in human chronic hepatitis C patients.44 TNF-a has
been shown to induce insulin resistance in experimental
animals and cultured cells.45 46 Inhibition of tyrosine phos￾phorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 and 2 may be one
of the mechanisms by which a high level of TNF-a causes
insulin resistance.46–48 Thus TNF-a was considered to be a
predominant cause of insulin resistance in transgenic mice.
Administration of an anti-TNF-a antibody restores insulin
sensitivity.43 These results provide direct experimental evi￾dence for the contribution of HCV in the development of
insulin resistance. There are experimental arguments for a
direct role of insulin in fibrosis progression in HCV infection.
Firstly, insulin receptors were identified on hepatic stellate
cells isolated from liver sections from patients with chronic
HCV infection.49 Secondly, in hepatic stellate cells, connective
tissue growth factor mRNA and protein were significantly
increased following incubation with insulin.50
Diabetes per se may lead to increased production of ROS,51
and secondary upregulation of antioxidant genes, glycosyla￾tion of low density lipoprotein and other proteins, as well as
the formation of advanced glycation end products (AGE).52
Expression of the AGE specific receptor (RAGE) in the liver is
restricted to stellate cells, and is upregulated at the time of
activation and transition to the myofibroblasts phenotype.53
In genetically obese rodents, characterised by severe steatosis,
insulin resistance is promoted by increased activity of
IkappaB kinase-b, the activator of nuclear factor kB
(NFkB).54 The latter is a transcription factor that plays a
key role in expression of several proinflammation genes.
Activation of NFkB may occur via oxidative stress mediated
signalling involving the p38 mitogen activated protein kinase
(MAPK).55 The link between insulin resistance and steatosis
is complex, and the exact sequence of events is unclear,
although several hypotheses have been made.56 Again, a
potential link between severity of steatosis and fibrosis may
be secondary to increased formation of reactive oxygen
species by steatotic hepatocytes (fig 2).
Human studies: steatosis and fibrosis progression
Factors influencing fibrosis progression in chronic hepatitis C
are poorly understood (box 2).57 There is some controversy
with regard to the influence of steatosis on the progression of
fibrosis. Among 14 studies, 10 found an association between
the presence of steatosis and a higher degree of fibrosis
(table 3). However, in most of these studies this association
was of low statistical significance. Furthermore, the histolo￾gical scores used were different, multivariate analysis was not
always performed, and the study populations were different
regarding risk factors for steatosis. Thus one possible
explanation accounting for the discrepancies is that steatosis
may be a cofactor of accelerated fibrosis progression as a
function of its pathogenesis (that is, viral v metabolic).
The fact that obesity has been related to the risk of cirrhosis
is an argument for a role of metabolic steatosis in the
progression of fibrosis. In several studies, among alcoholics
and patients with HCV infection, obesity favoured fibrosis.58–62
Fibrosis can indeed develop in overweight patients that are

devoid of any other causes of liver disease.63 However, in this
study, the degree of steatosis was not associated with fibrosis,
suggesting that a high BMI could be associated with fibrosis
through mechanisms other than steatosis.
At least four studies did not find a link between the
presence of steatosis and increased fibrosis (table 3). In our
study, steatosis, in multivariate analysis, was associated with
HCV genotype 3 infection, higher BMI, and high grade of
necroinflammation, but was not associated with high degree
of fibrosis.21 However, in a recent European study with 755
consecutive chronic hepatitis C patients, steatosis was
independently associated with fibrosis, but multivariate
analysis on patients divided according to viral genotype (that
is, 3 v non-3) showed that steatosis was associated with
fibrosis only in genotype 3 infected patients.22 It seems that
‘‘non-viral steatosis’’ could be as benign as NAFLD whereas
viral steatosis (genotype 3 induced steatosis) may accelerate
fibrosis progression. In another recent study from the USA,23
the opposite was true (that is, some evidence was presented
that steatosis may affect fibrosis progression only among
patients with genotype 1).
Hepatitis C virus, insulin resistance, and fibrosis
In one interesting study, Hui and colleagues41 observed that
patients with chronic hepatitis C with mild fibrosis (stage 0
or 1) had higher levels of insulin, C peptide, and HOMA-IR
(all p(0.01) compared with matched healthy controls. In the
250 hepatitis C virus patients (fibrosis stages 0–4), indepen￾dent predictors of HOMA-IR included higher BMI (p,0.001),
previous failed antiviral treatment (p,0.001), portal inflam￾matory grade (p,0.001), and genotype 3 infection (p = 0.01).
Genotype 3 had significantly lower HOMA-IR than other
genotypes (which were comparable when adjusted for the
effects of the remaining independent predictors). HOMA-IR
was an independent predictor for the degree of fibrosis
(p,0.001) and the rate of fibrosis progression (p = 0.03).
HCV may induce insulin resistance irrespective of the severity
of liver disease, and this effect seems to be genotype specific.
Furthermore, their findings support the hypothesis that
insulin resistance may contribute to fibrosis progression in
chronic HCV infection. Interestingly, insulin resistance may
contribute to fibrosis progression in chronic HCV infection
independent of the grade of steatosis. Surprisingly, in this
study, HCV genotype 3 had significantly lower insulin
resistance than other genotypes.
In another recent study,64 marked steatosis was associated
with HCV genotype 3 infection and high BMI. Overweight
patients had increased circulating insulin compared with lean
patients. More advanced fibrosis was associated with obesity
and insulin concentrations. Interestingly, in obese patients
with chronic HCV infection, circulating insulin levels
increased at an early stage of fibrosis (an argument for a
causal role). We should remember that in patients with
NAFLD, increasing insulin resistance is associated with more
severe disease and diabetes is a risk factor for disease
progression.65 Therefore, in overweight patients with HCV
infection, increasing circulating insulin levels may be one
factor responsible for the association between increasing BMI
and fibrosis.
In a retrospective survey, high serum glucose was found to
be associated with advanced fibrosis and higher fibrosis
progression rate in chronic hepatitis C patients, and was
independent of age at infection or duration of infection.66 The
profibrogenic impact of glucose intolerance was higher than
obesity. High serum glucose has also been independently
associated with fibrosis in alcoholic liver disease.67
STEATOSIS AND NECROINFLAMMATION
Several studies found a link between necroinflammation and
steatosis (table 3). Necroinflammatory activity in chronic
hepatitis C may fluctuate over time.68
There are several mechanisms which may account for the
relationship between steatosis and necroinflammation. In
vitro studies have shown that the HCV core protein could
lead to oxidative stress.35 Moreover, HCV is associated with
increased production of cytokines44 that enhance inflamma￾tion and lead to increased lipid peroxidation. Furthermore,
some patients may have NASH in addition to having chronic
hepatitis C. Steatosis could be the consequence of more
severe cell injury and necroinflammation rather than the
direct cause of worsening fibrosis.
HOW TO RECONCILE ALL OF THESE DATA?
Taking into account all of the published data, it seems that
there is an association between steatosis and fibrosis. But
does this mean that steatosis is the cause of fibrosis
progression? Steatosis could be a marker of necroinflamma￾tion and therefore a marker of fibrosis progression as several
studies found a significant association between necroin￾flammation and high stage of fibrosis.16 21 69 70 Steatosis could
also be a marker of insulin resistance. In patients with HCV
infection, insulin resistance may be one factor responsible for
both steatosis in one way and increasing fibrosis in another.
Interestingly, we reported recently the rate and risk of
cirrhosis in 96 patients infected by HCV during the bone
marrow transplantation period. At a median follow up of
15.7 years, 15 patients developed biopsy proven cirrhosis
leading to a cumulative incidence of cirrhosis of 24% at
20 years. By multivariate analysis, HCV genotype 3 was
associated with risk of cirrhosis.71
DOES TREATMENT IMPROVE STEATOSIS?
We initially reported a patient with HCV genotype 3 infection,
recurrent hepatitis after liver transplantation, and massive
steatosis, in whom steatosis disappeared when HCV replica￾tion was inhibited by treatment and recurred when replica￾tion relapsed after treatment withdrawal.72 73 This

observation was confirmed by other studies, thus supporting
a cytopathic effect of HCV genotype 3. In the first study,
Kumar and colleagues74 reported that in patients with HCV
genotype 1 (n = 28) there was no change in steatosis after
treatment, irrespectively of response; however in those
infected with genotype 3 (n = 34), a sustained virological
response (SVR) resulted in significantly reduced steatosis
(p,0.001) but no change in steatosis among those without
an SVR. In another study involving 1428 naive patients, the
presence of steatosis was associated with a lower SVR
(p,0.001)20 but in patients with an SVR, steatosis was most
improved in those with HCV genotype 3. In genotype 3
responders, baseline low serum cholesterol was corrected by
treatment (p,0.001). These results have been confirmed by
others.23
Interestingly, in a retrospective analysis of 174 patients
with chronic hepatitis C, obesity (and not steatosis) was a
negative predictor of SVR.75 It could be that obesity causes
steatosis and that each independently diminishes SVR.
Obesity decreases interferon bioavailability and impairs the
immune response to HCV. The mechanisms underlying the
influence of steatosis on SVR remain to be determined. An
intriguing aspect that arises from these studies is the fact that
steatosis seems to negatively influence SVR, as suggested by
earlier reports.76–77 This phenomenon seems to be limited to
patients with a non-HCV related type of steatosis as the
presence of even severe steatosis in patients with genotype 3
was not necessarily associated with a decreased rate of SVR.20
It is interesting to note that interferon a and insulin share
some factors in signalling transduction, such as p38 MAPK78:
whether insulin resistance translates into a relative resistance
to interferon a remains a matter of speculation.
CONCLUSION
The relationship between HCV and steatosis in terms of
fibrosis and disease progression is unclear. HCV genotype 3 is
clearly associated with steatosis (‘‘viral steatosis’’). It seems
that in some patients, steatosis may be associated with
fibrosis progression. The mechanisms underlying this asso￾ciation are unknown. The challenge for the clinician in care
of patients with chronic HCV infection and steatosis is to be
able to differentiate between those with pure steatosis alone
and a benign course from those with progressive disease (the
same challenge in separating NASH from NAFLD).
There remain many unanswered questions and there is a
need for large prospective studies on hepatitis C patients,
using multivariate analysis, which take into account con￾founding factors for steatosis, insulin resistance, fibrosis, and
response to treatment. A meta-analysis of individual patient
data (the HCV MAID Study) is ongoing to investigate the
relationship between steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis in
chronic hepatitis C. Moreover, we need to develop experi￾mental models using different HCV genotypes in order to
understand the mechanisms leading to steatosis.
