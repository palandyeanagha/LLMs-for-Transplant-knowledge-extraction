Guideline 277
1.Introduction
!
This article is part of a combined publication that
expresses the current view of the European Socie￾ty of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) about en￾doscopic biliary stenting for benign and malig￾nant conditions; the other part of the publication
describes the models of biliary stents available
and the techniques used for stenting [1].
2.Methods
!
The ESGE commissioned and funded these guide￾lines. The methodology was similar to that used
for other ESGE guidelines [2, 3]. Briefly, subgroups
were charged with a series of key questions (see
Appendix e1, available online). Search terms in￾cluded, at a minimum, “biliary” and “stent” as
well as words pertinent to specific key questions.
Searches were performed on Medline (via
Pubmed), the Cochrane Library, Embase, and the
internet. The number of articles retrieved and se￾lected for each task force is indicated in the Evi￾dence Table (see Appendix e2, available online).
Evidence levels and recommendation grades used
in these guidelines were slightly modified from
those recommended by the Scottish Intercollegi￾ate Guidelines Network (●" Table 1) [4]. Sub￾groups agreed electronically on draft proposals
that were presented to the entire group for gener￾al discussion during two meetings held in 2010
and 2011. The subsequent Guideline version was
again discussed using electronic mail until unani￾mous agreement was reached. Searches were re￾run in December 2010 (this date should be taken
into account for future updates). The final draft
was approved by all members of the guideline de￾velopment group; it was sent to all individual
ESGE members in April 2011 and, after incorpora￾tion of their comments, it was endorsed by the
ESGE Governing Board prior to submission to En￾doscopy for international peer review. It was also
approved by the British Society of Gastroenterol￾ogy and the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Ver￾dauungs- und Stoffwechselkrankheiten. The final
revised version was approved by all members of
the Guideline development group before publica￾tion.

This article is part of a combined publication that
expresses the current view of the European Socie￾ty of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy about endo￾scopic biliary stenting. The present Clinical
Guideline describes short-term and long-term re￾sults of biliary stenting depending on indications
and stent models; it makes recommendations on
when, how, and with which stent to perform bili￾ary drainage in most common clinical settings, in￾cluding in patients with a potentially resectable
malignant biliary obstruction and in those who
require palliative drainage of common bile duct
or hilar strictures. Treatment of benign conditions
(strictures related to chronic pancreatitis, liver
transplantation, or cholecystectomy, and leaks
and failed biliary stone extraction) and manage￾ment of complications (including stent revision)
are also discussed. A two-page executive summa￾ry of evidence statements and recommendations
is provided. A separate Technology Review de￾scribes the models of biliary stents available and
the stenting techniques, including advanced tech￾niques such as insertion of multiple plastic stents,
drainage of hilar strictures, retrieval of migrated
stents and combined stenting in malignant biliary
and duodenal obstructions.
The target readership for the Clinical Guideline
mostly includes digestive endoscopists, gastroen￾terologists, oncologists, radiologists, internists,
and surgeons while the Technology Review
should be most useful to endoscopists who per￾form biliary drainage.

Evidence statements and recommendations are stated in italics,
key evidence statements and recommendations are in bold. This
Guideline will be considered for review in 2015, or sooner if im￾portant new evidence becomes available. Any updates to the
Guideline in the interim period will be noted on the ESGE web￾site: http://www.esge.com/esge-guidelines.html.
3. Summary of statements and recommendations
!
3.1. Stent insertion
Biliary sphincterotomy is not necessary for inserting a single plastic
stent or a self-expandable metal stent (SEMS) (Evidence level 1 +) but
it may facilitate more complex stenting procedures (Evidence level
4). Results of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing biliary
stenting with or without biliary sphincterotomy are contradictory.
The anticipated benefits of pre-stenting biliary sphincterotomy
should be weighed against its risks on a case-by-case basis
(Recommendation grade B). If biliary sphincterotomy is per￾formed, blended electrosurgical current should be used (Recom￾mendation grade A).
Endoscopic biliary stenting is technically successful in > 90 % of at￾tempted cases. In the case of initial failure, multiple treatment op￾tions, including repeat endoscopic attempt, have provided technical
success in > 80 % of cases (Evidence level 1 + +). In the case of initial
failure at endoscopic biliary stenting, the indication for stenting
should be re-evaluated and, if it is maintained, the best treatment
option should be selected depending on the cause of failure, the
anatomy, the degree of emergency, and available resources (Re￾commendation grade A).
3.2. Short-term (1-month) efficacy of stents
for biliary drainage
Plastic stents and SEMSs provide similar short-term results with re￾spect to clinical success, morbidity, mortality, and improvement in
quality of life. Among plastic biliary stents, polyethylene models al￾low relief of obstruction more frequently than Teflon-made stents
of the Tannenbaum or Amsterdam type; among currently available
SEMS models no significant differences were reported at 30 days
(Evidence level 1 + +). Patient-related factors associated with failure
to resolve jaundice after biliary stenting include a high baseline
bilirubin level, diffuse liver metastases, and International Normal￾ized Ratio (INR) ≥1.5 (Evidence level 2 +).
Short-term considerations should not affect the choice between
biliary plastic stents and SEMSs; among plastic stents, Teflon￾made models should be avoided if identical designs of poly￾ethylene-made stents are available (Recommendation grade
A). In the case of cholangitis or decrease in total bilirubin level
of < 20 % from baseline at 7 days post stent insertion, biliary
imaging or endoscopic revision should be considered (Recom￾mendation grade D).
3.3. Long-term stent efficacy for palliation of malignant
common bile duct (CBD) obstruction
For palliation of malignant CBD obstruction, endoscopic biliary
drainage is effective in > 80 % of cases (Evidence level 1 + +), with
lower morbidity than surgery (Evidence level 1 +). SEMSs present a
lower risk of recurring biliary obstruction than single plastic
stents, without difference in patient survival, at least if patients
are regularly followed (Evidence level 1 +). Initial insertion of a
plastic stent is most cost-effective if patient life expectancy is short￾er than 4 months; if it is longer than 4 months then initial insertion
of a SEMS is more cost-effective (Evidence level 2 +). Amongst SEMS

models measuring 10mm in diameter, no difference has been clear￾ly demonstrated, including between covered and uncovered mod￾els. Amongst plastic stents, those measuring 10 Fr in diameter,
and possibly some stent designs (i. e., DoubleLayer and stents equip￾ped with an antireflux valve), provide the longest biliary patency;
drug administration does not prolong stent patency (Evidence level
1 +).
Palliative drainage of malignant CBD obstruction should be
first attempted endoscopically (Recommendation grade A). Ini￾tial insertion of a 10-Fr plastic stent is recommended if the di￾agnosis of malignancy is not established or if expected survival
is < 4 months (Recommendation grade C). No drug prescription is
recommended to prolong stent patency (Recommendation grade
A). In patients with an established diagnosis of malignancy, initial
insertion of a 10-mm diameter SEMS is recommended if expected
survival is > 4 months (or if SEMS cost is < 50 % that of endoscopic
retrograde cholangiopancreatography [ERCP]). Amongst biliary
SEMSs, a model that is economical and with which the endoscopist
has personal experience is recommended (Recommendation grade
C).
3.4.Indications for stenting and stent selection in
patients with a potentially resectable CBD obstruction
In patients with a resectable malignant CBD stricture, insertion of a
plastic biliary stent followed by delayed surgery is associated with
a higher morbidity compared with surgery at 1 week (Evidence lev￾el 1 + +). Some models of biliary SEMSs (short intrapancreatic or
covered) do not impede pancreatic resection and may be used for
preoperative biliary drainage in patients with malignant CBD ob￾struction whose surgical status is uncertain (Evidence level 2 +).
We recommend preoperative drainage of potentially resectable
malignant CBD obstruction only in patients who are candi￾dates for neoadjuvant therapies, in patients with acute cholan￾gitis, or in patients with intense pruritus and delayed surgery
(Recommendation grade A). Plastic as well as short intrapan￾creatic or covered SEMSs may be used, with a preference for
SEMSs in patients who are candidates for neoadjuvant thera￾pies (Recommendation grade C).
3.5. Complications of biliary stenting
3.5.1. Early complications
Early complications develop in approximately 5 % of patients after
attempted endoscopic biliary stenting and are not related to the
type of stent used (Evidence level 1 + +). The reader is referred to
other guidelines for detailed recommendations about the preven￾tion of infection, pancreatitis, and bleeding.
3.5.2. Late complications
Late complications of biliary stenting mostly consist of stent dys￾function, which is approximately twice as frequent with plastic
stents compared with SEMSs, and, much less frequently, cholecysti￾tis, duodenal perforation, and bleeding ulcer (Evidence level 1 +).
Approximately 5 % of plastic stents and partially covered SEMSs mi￾grate while 1 % of uncovered SEMSs and 20 % of fully covered SEMSs
migrate. After distal migration, most plastic stents are sponta￾neously eliminated. (Evidence level 1 +). Migration of plastic stents
is more frequent in benign as compared with malignant biliary
strictures, and with single as compared with multiple stents. Endo￾scopic treatment of stent migration is feasible in > 90 % of cases
with low morbidity (Evidence level 2 +).
In patients with migrated stents, we recommend ERCP for re￾moving stents that have not been spontaneously eliminated
and for stenting potentially persistent strictures. In the case of
persistent biliary stricture, we recommend inserting multiple
plastic stents or, if a SEMS is indicated, an uncovered model
(Recommendation grade C).
Stent occlusion is caused by sludge (in plastic stents), or by tissue
ingrowth/overgrowth or sludge (in SEMSs) (Evidence level 1–). En￾doscopic restoration of biliary patency is successful in > 95 % of pa￾tients with stent obstruction and exceptionally gives rise to compli￾cations (Evidence level 2 +). For occluded SEMSs, mechanical SEMS
cleansing is poorly effective for restoring biliary patency; inserting
a second SEMS within the occluded SEMS yields a longer biliary pa￾tency than inserting a plastic stent, particularly if one of the two
SEMSs (initially placed or placed for treating stent dysfunction) is
a covered model (Evidence level 2–).
We recommend ERCP in patients with biliary stent occlusion, ex￾cept when this is considered futile in patients with advanced malig￾nant disease. Plastic stents should be exchanged for plastic (single
or multiple) stents or a SEMS, according to the criteria stated
above. Occlusion of biliary SEMSs should be treated by inserting
a second SEMS within the occlusion (a covered model should be
selected if the first SEMS was uncovered) or, in the case of a life
expectancy ≤3 months, by inserting a plastic stent (Recommen￾dation grade C).
Neoplastic involvement of the cystic duct and gallbladder stones
are the key risk factors for SEMS-related cholecystitis (Evidence
level 2 +).
3.6. Particular cases
3.6.1.Hilar strictures
In the case of malignant hilar stricture (MHS), assessment of tumor
resectability by CT or MRI may be affected by the presence of biliary
stents (Evidence level 2 +). Resectability of MHS should be eval￾uated by imaging techniques in the absence of biliary stents
(Recommendation grade C).
In MHS of Bismuth–Corlette type ≥2, better biliary drainage might
be achieved with fewer infective complications by the percuta￾neous as compared with the endoscopic route (Evidence level 1–).
Drainage by means of a combined endoscopic and percutaneous
approach may be necessary to treat infective complications of
MHS, especially in the setting of opacified and undrained intrahe￾patic biliary ducts. Endoscopic drainage of complex MHS more fre￾quently fails in low volume vs. high volume centers (Evidence level
2–). Local expertise for percutaneous and endoscopic biliary drain￾age may not be available in many centers (Evidence level 1–).
The choice between endoscopic or percutaneous drainage for MHS
should be based on local expertise (Recommendation grade D); en￾doscopic drainage should be performed in high volume centers
with experienced endoscopists and multidisciplinary teams
(Recommendation grade C).
MRI seems to be slightly more accurate than CT for assessing the
level of obstruction in MHS; both methods allow measurement of
the volume of liver lobes. This ductal and parenchymal informa￾tion is useful for directing palliative drainage of MHS (Evidence lev￾el 2 +). We recommend performance of MRI to assess the hepatobili￾ary anatomy before attempting drainage of MHS (Recommenda￾tion grade C).
After bilateral biliary opacification upstream from MHS, morbidity
and mortality rates are higher with unilateral compared with bi￾lateral biliary drainage (Evidence level 2–). A low incidence of chol￾angitis has consistently been achieved when specific endoscopic

techniques were used to target drainage to duct(s) selected on the
basis of MRI or CT (Evidence level 2 +). Draining > 50 % of the liver
volume is associated with higher drainage effectiveness and longer
survival than draining < 50 % of the liver volume (Evidence level
2–).
In MHS, the liver sector(s) to be drained should be selected be￾fore beginning ERCP, based on MRI or CT, with the aim of drain￾ing > 50 % of the liver volume. Bile duct(s) unintentionally opa￾cified upstream from an MHS should be drained during the
same procedure. Antibiotics should be administered in case of an￾ticipated incomplete biliary drainage and, if drainage proves to be
incomplete, they should be continued until complete drainage is
achieved (Recommendation grade C).
Plastic stents and uncovered SEMSs yield similar short-term results
in patients with MHS but SEMSs provide a longer biliary patency
compared with plastic stents (only uncovered SEMSs are used in
this setting to prevent occlusion of side branches) (Evidence level
1–). Plastic stenting is recommended as long as no definitive deci￾sion about curative/palliative treatment has been taken. If a deci￾sion for palliative treatment is taken, insertion of SEMSs is recom￾mended in patients with life expectancy > 3 months or with biliary
infection (Recommendation grade B).
SEMSs do not impede light delivery for photodynamic therapy but
adjustments of the light dose are required (Evidence level 2 + +).
Trans-SEMS photodynamic therapy for palliation of malignant hi￾lar strictures should be administered in centers with well-trained
personnel (Recommendation grade D).
Stent dysfunction in patients with MHS is treated as follows: plas￾tic stents are removed, ducts are cleaned, and new stents are inser￾ted; uncovered SEMSs are cleaned and, in the case of persistent
stricture, new stents are inserted. The choice between plastic stents
or SEMSs for re-stenting is based on the degree of biliary infection
and the life expectancy (Recommendation grade D).
3.6.2. Benign strictures
In the case of benign CBD strictures, temporary simultaneous
placement of multiple plastic stents is technically feasible in > 90 %
of patients; it is the endoscopic technique that provides the highest
long-term biliary patency rate (90 % for postoperative biliary stric￾tures and 65 % for those complicating chronic pancreatitis); it re￾quires a mean of approximately four ERCPs over a 12-month peri￾od. Possible stricture recurrences after this treatment are usually
successfully re-treated by ERCP. Temporary placement of single
plastic stents provides poorer patency rates; treatment with un￾covered SEMSs is plagued by high long-term morbidity; temporary
placement of covered SEMSs is an investigational option that needs
to be carefully evaluated by long-term follow-up studies (Evidence
level 1 + ).
In patients with benign CBD strictures, we recommend tempor￾ary placement of multiple plastic stents provided that the pa￾tient consents and is thought likely to be compliant with repeat
interventions. The insertion of uncovered biliary SEMSs is
strongly discouraged (Recommendation grade A). Covered
SEMSs are a promising alternative for selected benign CBD stric￾tures. Because of the risk of fatal septic complications, a recall
system should be set up for the care of patients who do not pre￾sent for ERCP at scheduled dates (Recommendation grade D).
3.6.3. Bile leaks
In the absence of transection of the CBD, endoscopic treatment
(biliary sphincterotomy or temporary drainage associated with re￾moval of any potentially associated biliary obstacle) allows healing
of more than 90 % of biliary leaks. Biliary stenting provides faster
leak resolution than sphincterotomy alone; it is equally effective
whether sphincterotomy is performed or not. Biliary sphinctero￾tomy is associated with a risk of short-term and long-term compli￾cations, particularly in young patients (Evidence level 1 +). In the
case of temporary biliary stenting, biliary abnormalities (mostly
sludge, stones, or persistent leak) can be found at the time of stent
removal in a significant proportion of patients (Evidence level 2–).
We recommend discussing the advantages and inconveniences of
available treatment options with the patient before ERCP (e. g., the
need for repeat ERCP in the case of stenting). At ERCP, one should
pay particular attention to locating the leak and to detection of po￾tentially associated biliary lesions or obstacles (e. g., retained stone)
that require specific treatment. In the absence of such lesions, we
recommend insertion of a plastic biliary stent without perform￾ance of sphincterotomy, and removal of the stent 4 to 8 weeks later.
Endoscopic sphincterotomy alone is an alternative option, in
particular in elderly patients (Recommendation grade B). At the
time of stent removal, cholangiography and duct cleansing should
be performed (Recommendation grade D).
3.6.4. Temporary stenting for biliary stones
In patients with irretrievable biliary stones, insertion of a plastic
stent is effective in the short term to drain the bile ducts; it is fre￾quently associated with partial (or even complete) stone dissolu￾tion that facilitates delayed endoscopic stone removal in most cases
(Evidence level 1–). Addition of oral ursodeoxycholic acid does not
increase the stone dissolution rate (Evidence level 1–) but a combi￾nation of oral ursodeoxycholic acid and terpene could be more ef￾fective (Evidence level 2–). Morbidity/mortality is high in the case
of long-term biliary stenting (Evidence level 1 +).
If ERCP fails to remove difficult biliary stones or is contraindicated,
temporary (e. g., 3-month) plastic stenting should be considered.
After biliary stent placement, the patient and referring physicians
should be warned that, when used as a long-term measure, stent
placement is associated with a high risk of cholangitis (Recommen￾dation grade B). Addition of oral ursodeoxycholic acid associated
with terpene should be considered (Recommendation grade D).
4. Stent insertion
!
Biliary sphincterotomy is not necessary for inserting a single plas￾tic stent or a SEMS (Evidence level 1 +) but it may facilitate more
complex stenting procedures (Evidence level 4). Results of random￾ized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing biliary stenting with or
without biliary sphincterotomy are contradictory. The anticipated
benefits of pre-stenting biliary sphincterotomy should be weighed
against its risks on a case-by-case basis (Recommendation grade
B). If biliary sphincterotomy is performed, blended electrosurgical
current should be used (Recommendation grade A).
Biliary sphincterotomy is not necessary for inserting single plas￾tic or metal biliary stents [5–9]. Three RCTs compared stent
placement preceded or not by biliary sphincterotomy. The two
RCTs that used plastic stents included a total of 244 patients
with a malignant CBD stricture or a post-cholecystectomy bile
leak; no significant difference in terms of early or late complica￾tions, including stent migration, was found between patients
who had biliary sphincterotomy or not [6, 8]. The third RCT
included 72 patients treated with covered SEMSs and found a
higher complication rate in patients who had undergone sphinc￾terotomy compared with those who had not (49 % vs. 11 %,

respectively; P = 0.006) [5]. Sphincterotomy-related complica￾tions were reported in 24 % of patients (bleeding, 13 %; perfora￾tion, 11 %), an incidence that is much higher compared with that
reported with SEMS insertion in a meta-analysis (5.7 %) [10]; this
discrepancy was not discussed in the article.
Pre-stenting biliary sphincterotomy is performed routinely by
some endoscopists either because they think that this will facili￾tate stent exchange during follow-up or because more than one
biliary stent is to be placed (e. g., in hilar obstruction or benign
CBD stricture). If biliary sphincterotomy is performed, blended
electrosurgical current should be used to decrease the risk of
bleeding [11].
Endoscopic biliary stenting is technically successful in > 90 % of at￾tempted cases. In the case of initial failure, multiple treatment op￾tions, including repeat endoscopic attempt, have provided technical
success in > 80 % of cases (Evidence level 1 + +). In the case of initial
failure at endoscopic biliary stenting, the indication for stenting
should be re-evaluated and, if it is maintained, the best treatment
option should be selected depending on the cause of failure, the
anatomy, the degree of emergency, and available resources (Re￾commendation grade A).
Biliary stenting may fail because of difficulties in reaching the pa￾pilla (e. g., duodenal stricture, previous surgery), in cannulating
the bile duct, or in passing strictures in a retrograde fashion
[10]. Factors contributing to failures include endoscopist experi￾ence [12, 13], the volume of procedures per center [14], and in￾adequate patient sedation [15, 16]. The type of stent used does
not influence the success of stent insertion [10].
In a retrospective study of 47 initially failed ERCPs, the indication
for ERCP was maintained in only 51 % of cases (current propor￾tions may be higher with the expansion of imaging techniques)
[17]. In the case of failed endoscopic stenting, nonsurgical op￾tions that have provided technical success rates of > 80 % include
repeat attempt at ERCP by the same endoscopist (or another one
in the same institution) [17, 18], percutaneous drainage (possibly
followed by a rendezvous procedure) and EUS-guided cholan￾giography [19]. The latter technique should be reserved to endos￾copists at tertiary care centers with advanced training in both
EUS and ERCP.
5. Short-term (1-month) efficacy of stents for biliary
drainage
!
Plastic stents and SEMSs provide similar short-term results with
respect to clinical success, morbidity, mortality, and improve￾ment in quality of life. Among plastic biliary stents, polyethylene
models allow relief of obstruction relief more frequently than Te￾flon-made stents of the Tannenbaum or Amsterdam type; among
currently available SEMS models no significant differences were re￾ported at 30 days (Evidence level 1 + +). Patient-related factors
associated with failure to resolve jaundice after biliary stenting in￾clude a high baseline bilirubin level, diffuse liver metastases, and
International Normalized Ratio (INR) ≥1.5 (Evidence level 2 +).
Short-term considerations should not affect the choice between
biliary plastic stents and SEMSs; among plastic stents, Teflon￾made models should be avoided if identical designs of polyethy￾lene-made stents are available (Recommendation grade A). In the
case of cholangitis or decrease in total bilirubin level of < 20 % from
baseline at 7 days post stent insertion, biliary imaging or endo￾scopic revision should be considered (Recommendation grade D).
RCTs that compared various stent models for treating biliary ob￾struction have mostly included patients with a malignant distal
biliary obstruction. A meta-analysis of these RCTs found that:
1. Plastic stents and SEMSs provide similar short-term success,
defined by decrease in levels of jaundice, serum bilirubin, or
pruritus (three RCTs, 288 patients) and similar 30-day mortal￾ity (five RCTs, 498 patients).
2. Compared with polyethylene-made stents, Teflon-made stents
provide significantly less short-term success (three RCTs, 278
patients) but similar morbidity and 30-day mortality (five
RCTs, 441 patients) [10].
Teflon-made stents (with or without sideholes) proved in RCTs to
present more drainage failures compared with polyethylene
stents (stent migration was more frequent with Teflon-made
stents in one study; reason for failure was not investigated in a
majority of patients in another RCT) [20–22].
Four RCTs compared various SEMS models, including covered and
uncovered Wallstents and Ultraflex Diamond stents, Luminex,
Hanaro, Zilver, and spiral Z stents [23–26]; none of these RCTs
reported a significant difference in short-term efficacy of SEMSs.
Symptoms that may improve after biliary stenting include pruri￾tus, jaundice, anorexia, asthenia, sleep pattern, and diarrhea [27].
In two prospective studies, only a minority of the domains of
quality of life that were investigated using validated question￾naires had significantly improved 4 weeks after stent insertion
(drop-out rates were high at 19 % and 48 %) [28, 29]. One of these
studies found: (i) that improvements were less important in pa￾tients with a baseline bilirubin > 13mg/dL, and (ii) that hyperbi￾lirubinemia decreased after stent insertion by at least 20 % at
day 7 in 78 % of patients [28]. Another study found that 76 % of pa￾tients achieved a post stenting bilirubin level of ≤2mg/dL [30].
Failures to achieve this level were associated with a high baseline
bilirubin level, particular features of biliary stricture (multifocal
or located outside of the CBD), diffuse liver metastases, and INR
of ≥1.5. The authors recommended endoscopic revision in pa￾tients who fail to achieve a bilirubin level of ≤2mg/dL, after 3
weeks if the pre-stenting bilirubin level was < 10mg/dL, or after
6 weeks if the pre-stenting level was ≥10mg/dL.
6. Long-term stent efficacy for palliation of malignant
common bile duct (CBD) obstruction
!
For palliation of malignant CBD obstruction, endoscopic biliary
drainage is effective in > 80 % of cases (Evidence level 1 + +), with
lower morbidity than surgery (Evidence level 1 +). SEMSs present a
lower risk of recurring biliary obstruction than single plastic
stents, without difference in patient survival, at least if patients
are regularly followed up (Evidence level 1 +). Initial insertion of a
plastic stent is most cost-effective if patient life expectancy is short￾er or than 4 months; if it is longer than 4 months then initial inser￾tion of a SEMS is more cost-effective (Evidence level 2 +). Amongst
SEMS models measuring 10mm in diameter, no difference has
been clearly demonstrated, including between covered and un￾covered models. Amongst plastic stents, those measuring 10 Fr in
diameter, and possibly some stent designs (i. e., DoubleLayer and
stents equipped with an antireflux valve), provide the longest bili￾ary patency; drug administration does not prolong stent patency
(Evidence level 1 +).
Palliative drainage of malignant CBD obstruction should be first at￾tempted endoscopically (Recommendation grade A). Initial inser￾tion of a 10-Fr plastic stent is recommended if the diagnosis of ma￾Dumonceau J-M et al. ESGE Clinical Guideline for biliary stenting… Endoscopy 2012; 44: 277–298

lignancy is not established or if expected survival is < 4 months (Re￾commendation grade C). No drug prescription is recommended to
prolong stent patency (Recommendation grade A). In patients
with an established diagnosis of malignancy, initial insertion of a
10-mm diameter SEMS is recommended if expected survival is > 4
months (or if SEMS cost is < 50 % that of ERCP). Amongst biliary
SEMSs, a model that is economical and with which the endoscopist
has personal experience is recommended (Recommendation grade
C).
A meta-analysis of three RCTs including 308 patients in total has
compared endoscopic vs. surgical biliary drainage in patients
with pancreatic cancer [31]. No differences in terms of technical
success, therapeutic success, survival, or quality of life were
found. Nevertheless, the relative risk of all complications was re￾duced by 40 % (P < 0.001) and there was a trend for a lower 30-day
mortality rate (P = 0.07) in the endoscopy group. Biliary obstruc￾tion recurred more frequently in the endoscopy compared with
the surgical group (P < 0.001) but plastic stents were used. A sin￾gle RCT compared surgery vs. SEMS for biliary drainage in 30 pa￾tients with pancreatic cancer, with no differences between
groups except a better quality of life at 30 days and a lower total
cost in favor of the endoscopic treatment [32].
For the comparison of plastic stents vs. SEMSs, a meta-analysis
(seven RCTs including a total of 724 patients with a malignant
distal biliary obstruction) showed that the risk of recurring bili￾ary obstruction was halved with SEMSs compared with plastic
stents, both at 4 months and until patient death/end-of-study
[33]. Another meta-analysis included slightly different RCTs and
reached similar conclusions [10]. The median patency of 10-Fr
plastic stents has been estimated at 4–5 months and no signifi￾cant differences were reported for patient survival [10, 33]. How￾ever, based on a retrospective study, it has been suggested that
outside of the strict follow-up of RCTs, survival could be pro￾longed with stents that provide longer biliary patency [34]. With
regard to cost–effectiveness, a decision analysis model showed
that, for the endoscopic drainage of malignant non-hilar biliary
obstruction, initial insertion of a SEMS is most cost-effective if
patient life expectancy is longer than 4 months or if SEMS cost is
< 50 % that of ERCP, but otherwise initial insertion of a plastic
stent is most economical [35]. However, a retrospective study
where SEMS cost was four times that of ERCP found that the
cost of biliary drainage using SEMSs or plastic stents was similar
and that patients treated with SEMSs had shorter hospital stays
[36].
For the comparison of plastic stent models, the stent diameter is
critical: 10-Fr models provide longer biliary patency compared
with thinner ones (11.5-Fr models do not provide longer paten￾cy) [37–40]. A Tannenbaum stent design (i. e., without sideholes)
was suggested to provide longer biliary patency than a standard
model in a nonrandomized study [41]; this was not confirmed in
RCTs [20, 42]. Additional modifications to the Tannenbaum de￾sign (i. e., use of a specific material for the DoubleLayer stent
[Olympus, Tokyo, Japan] or addition of an antireflux valve [Wil￾son-Cook, Winston-Salem, NC, USA]) were found to prolong bili￾ary patency relative to standard Tannenbaum design in single
RCTs that require confirmation [43, 44]. Another possibility to
prolong biliary patency could be to insert multiple plastic stents
(only one of 22 patients [4.5 %] had relapsing biliary obstruction
with multiple stents left in place for a median of 242 days in a ret￾rospective study) [45]. With polyethylene biliary stents, urso￾deoxycholic acid and antibiotics are ineffective to prevent stent
dysfunction; patency duration decreases with increasing num￾bers of stent exchanges [46, 47].
For the comparison of covered vs. uncovered SEMSs, three RCTs
showed contradictory results: longer patency with a noncom￾mercially available covered model in 112 patients (one RCT) and
no difference with a commercially available model in 529 pa￾tients (two RCTs) [23, 48, 49]. For the comparison of different
models of uncovered SEMSs, three RCTs compared six SEMS
models in 465 patients [24–26]; the single factor that was asso￾ciated with a shorter patency duration was a smaller (6-mm)
stent diameter [25].
7.Indications for stenting and stent selection in
patients with a potentially resectable CBD obstruction
!
In patients with a resectable malignant CBD stricture, insertion of a
plastic biliary stent followed by delayed surgery is associated with
a higher morbidity compared with surgery at 1 week (Evidence
level 1 + +). Some models of biliary SEMSs (short intrapancreatic or
covered) do not impede pancreatic resection and may be used for
preoperative biliary drainage in patients with malignant CBD ob￾struction whose surgical status is uncertain (Evidence level 2 +).
We recommend preoperative drainage of potentially resectable
malignant CBD obstruction only in patients who are candidates
for neoadjuvant therapies, in patients with acute cholangitis, or in
patients with intense pruritus and delayed surgery (Recommenda￾tion grade A). Plastic as well as short, intrapancreatic or covered
SEMSs may be used, with a preference for SEMSs in patients who
are candidates for neoadjuvant therapies (Recommendation grade
C).
In patients with a malignant CBD obstruction scheduled for sur￾gical resection, two RCTs have shown that overall morbidity was
increased if plastic biliary drains were placed preoperatively
compared with direct surgery [50, 51]. These results are in line
with a meta-analysis of four RCTs that compared preoperative
percutaneous biliary drainage with direct surgery in similar indi￾cations [52]. Nevertheless, if for any reason an ERCP is performed
for diagnostic purposes, drainage must be provided to prevent
cholangitis [53].
If patient surgical status is uncertain when endoscopic biliary
drainage is performed, short or covered SEMSs are as cost-effec￾tive as plastic stents to drain a biliary obstruction related to a
pancreatic cancer (the difference in costs is approximately 1 %)
[54, 55]. This is related to the facts that: (i) only a minority of pa￾tients with a pancreatic cancer actually undergo resection (hence
the longer patency of SEMSs vs. plastic stents is beneficial in a
majority of patients), and (ii) if resection is performed, it is not
hindered by a short intrapancreatic SEMS or a covered SEMS. A
potential benefit of SEMS over plastic stents in these conditions
is the lower incidence of stent-related complications as suggested
by retrospective case-controlled studies [56, 57].
In patients with an uncertain diagnosis at the time of biliary
drainage, a plastic stent is preferred to avoid long-term complica￾tions of SEMSs in benign strictures [58]. Ideally, EUS staging
should be performed before biliary drainage as T staging may be
inaccurate in the presence of a biliary stent [59, 60].

8. Complications of biliary stenting
!
8.1. Early complications
Early complications develop in approximately 5 % of patients after
attempted endoscopic biliary stenting and are not related to the
type of stent used (Evidence level 1 + + ). The reader is referred to
other guidelines for detailed recommendations about the preven￾tion of infection, pancreatitis, and bleeding.
Early complications were reported in 4.9 % of 638 patients inclu￾ded in RCTs that compared various stent models for the endo￾scopic drainage of malignant CBD obstruction [20–22, 42, 61–
64]. Complications were distributed as follows: biliary infection
(35 %), pancreatitis (29 %), bleeding (23 %), perforation (6 %), early
stent migration and renal failure (3 % each). Complication rates
were not different between stent models in a meta-analysis of
RCTs [33].
Post-ERCP biliary infection is a serious complication that is fatal
in 8 %–20 % of cases and is best prevented by complete biliary
drainage [53, 65]. Recent guidelines recommend routine antibio￾tic prophylaxis in selected patients (with liver transplant, or se￾vere neutropenia, advanced hematological malignancy, or antici￾pated incomplete biliary drainage) and a full antibiotic course if
adequate biliary drainage is not achieved during the procedure
[65].
Post-ERCP pancreatitis is usually mild but it may rarely be fatal.
Recent ESGE guidelines recommended periprocedural rectal ad￾ministration of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for proce￾dures at low risk of post-ERCP pancreatitis and consideration of
prophylactic pancreatic stent placement in high risk conditions,
including precut biliary sphincterotomy, pancreatic guidewire￾assisted biliary cannulation and simultaneous presence of several
risk factors for post-ERCP pancreatitis [66, 67]. These measures
have not yet been largely adopted in the endoscopy community
[68].
Bleeding is associated with sphincterotomy, not with biliary
stenting [69]; it is made more likely by coagulation disorders
but not by aspirin or by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
[70]. If sphincterotomy is envisaged, patients with a clinical his￾tory suggestive of a bleeding disorder (as is frequently the case in
patients subjected to biliary stenting) should undergo testing of
platelet count and prothrombin time [71]; these parameters
should be managed to obtain adequate values during sphincter￾otomy, and blended current should be used [11, 70, 72].
8.2. Late complications
Late complications of biliary stenting mostly consist of stent dys￾function, which is approximately twice as frequent with plastic
stents compared with SEMSs, and, much less frequently, cholecysti￾tis, duodenal perforation, and bleeding ulcer (Evidence level 1 +).
●" Table 2 summarizes the incidence of the most frequent late
complications of biliary stenting. Rare complications (e. g., duo￾denal perforation, bleeding ulcer) were mostly described in case
reports. Causes of stent dysfunction vary according to the type of
stent; with fully covered SEMS, prospective studies are sparse
and design modifications to prevent migration (flared ends, an￾choring fins) are being tested.
8.2.1. Stent dysfunction
8.2.1.1 Stent migration Approximately 5 % of plastic stents and
partially covered SEMSs migrate while 1 % of uncovered SEMSs
and 20 % of fully covered SEMSs migrate. After distal migration,
most plastic stents are spontaneously eliminated. (Evidence level
1 + ). Migration of plastic stents is more frequent in benign as com￾pared with malignant biliary strictures, and with single as compar￾ed with multiple stents. Endoscopic treatment of stent migration is
feasible in > 90 % of cases with low morbidity (Evidence level 2 +).
In patients with migrated stents, we recommend ERCP for remov￾ing stents that have not been spontaneously eliminated and for
stenting potentially persistent strictures. In the case of persistent
biliary stricture, we recommend inserting multiple plastic stents
or, if a SEMS is indicated, an uncovered model (Recommendation
grade C).
According to a retrospective study, risk factors for plastic stent mi￾gration include bridging of a benign biliary stricture and insertion
of a single stent [73]. After distal migration, most plastic stents are
spontaneously eliminated although bowel perforation (mostly in
the duodenum) may exceptionally occur. In contrast to plastic
stents, covered SEMSs are rarely eliminated spontaneously after
distal migration (two of 36 patients in a recent series) [74].
Regarding treatment, proximally migrated plastic stents or SEMSs
may be retrieved with a success rate > 90 % using techniques de￾scribed in the associated ESGE Technology Review [1]; no compli￾cations were reported in the few trials that mentioned this out￾come [75–77]. If a SEMS cannot be extracted, its distal extremity
can be trimmed in the case of distal migration or, in the case of
proximal migration with a persistent stricture, a second SEMS
can be inserted within the first one [1].
8.2.1.2. Stent occlusion Stent occlusion is caused by sludge (in
plastic stents) or by tissue ingrowth/overgrowth or sludge (in
SEMSs) (Evidence level 1–). Endoscopic restoration of biliary pa￾tency is successful in > 95 % of patients with stent obstruction and
exceptionally gives rise to complications (Evidence level 2 +). For oc￾cluded SEMSs, mechanical SEMS cleansing is poorly effective for re￾storing biliary patency; inserting a second SEMS within the occlud￾ed SEMS yields a longer biliary patency than inserting a plastic
stent, particularly if one of the two SEMSs (initially placed or
placed for treating stent dysfunction) is a covered model (Evidence
level 2–).

We recommend ERCP in patients with biliary stent occlusion, ex￾cept when this is considered futile in patients with advanced malig￾nant disease. Plastic stents should be exchanged for plastic (single
or multiple) stents or a SEMS, according to the criteria stated
above. Occlusion of biliary SEMSs should be treated by inserting a
second SEMS within the occlusion (a covered model should be selec￾ted if the first SEMS was uncovered) or, in the case of a life expec￾tancy ≤3 months, by inserting a plastic stent (Recommendation
grade C).
In patients with stent occlusion, ERCP successfully restores biliary
patency in > 95 % of patients and, in contrast to first stent inser￾tion, it only rarely gives rise to complications [78–81]. Plastic
stents present a median patency of 62–165 days; these stents
may be exchanged prophylactically at scheduled intervals or
when stent dysfunction develops [10]. Obstruction of biliary
SEMSs is related to sludge deposition or tissue ingrowth/over￾growth. Five retrospective studies have reported the results of
endoscopic treatment for SEMS occlusion in 216 patients [78–
82]. Three of these studies (involving 99 patients) tested SEMS
cleansing as the only treatment for restoring biliary patency;
they showed that it was poorly effective (median biliary patency
following SEMS cleansing, 24–43 days) [78–80]. The five studies
also compared insertion of a plastic stent vs. insertion of a second
SEMS within the occluded SEMS, with slightly divergent results:
three studies reported a longer biliary patency with a second
SEMS compared with a plastic stent (the difference was statisti￾cally significant in two studies [79, 81]), and one study reported
a longer biliary patency with a plastic stent inserted within the
occluded SEMS [80]. The two most recent studies, also the lar￾gest, included 117 patients of whom 99 patients received a sec￾ond SEMS to restore biliary patency [81, 82]. Both of these studies
showed that cumulative biliary patency was shorter in patients
who had uncovered SEMS inserted at the first and second ERCP
compared with those who had received at least one covered
SEMS (in the largest study, survival was also significantly longer
in these patients).
8.2.2 Stent-related cholecystitis
Neoplastic involvement of the cystic duct and gallbladder stones
are the key risk factors for SEMS-related cholecystitis (Evidence
level 2 + ).
The risk of SEMS-related acute cholecystitis has recently been
scrutinized because this complication has been reported in up to
10 % of patients [83–86]. Two large retrospective studies have
found that tumor involvement of the cystic duct ostium, plus
the presence of gallbladder stone in one study, but not the pres￾ence or absence of a covering on the SEMS are the main factors
associated with post-ERCP cholecystitis [85, 87]. Moreover, two
RCTs comparing covered and uncovered SEMS in 529 patients
did not find different rates of SEMS-induced cholecystitis
[48, 49]. However, some authors recommend inserting covered
SEMS only in patients with previous cholecystectomy or below
the cystic duct ostium. Prophylactic placement of a plastic stent
in the gallbladder has been attempted but it may cause wire per￾foration or high rates of cholecystitis in the case of failed stent in￾sertion [88]. Cholecystitis should be treated on a case-by-case ba￾sis by cholecystectomy or percutaneous gallbladder drainage in
frail patients.
9. Particular cases
!
9.1. Hilar strictures
In the case of malignant hilar stricture (MHS), assessment of tumor
resectability by CT or MRI may be affected by the presence of biliary
stents (Evidence level 2 + ). Resectability of MHS should be evaluat￾ed by imaging techniques in the absence of biliary stents (Recom￾mendation grade C).
Multidetector-row CT and MRI are relatively accurate (75–90 %)
in assessment of resectability of hilar tumors although they may
underestimate ductal spread [89, 90]. Biliary stents create arti￾facts, reduce intrahepatic biliary dilatation and possibly cause
periductal inflammation that may lead to misinterpretations at
CT and MRI [91, 92]. Reported experience of EUS staging of hilar
malignancy is very limited because the technique is extremely
demanding [93], although a new forward-viewing echoendo￾scope could facilitate the procedure [94].
In MHS of Bismuth–Corlette type ≥2, better biliary drainage might
be achieved with fewer infective complications by the percuta￾neous as compared with the endoscopic route (Evidence level 1–).
Drainage by means of a combined endoscopic and percutaneous
approach may be necessary to treat infective complications of
MHS, especially in the setting of opacified and undrained intra￾hepatic biliary ducts. Endoscopic drainage of complex MHS more
frequently fails in low volume vs. high volume centers (Evidence
level 2–). Local expertise for percutaneous and endoscopic biliary
drainage may not be available in many centers (Evidence level 1–).
The choice between endoscopic or percutaneous drainage for MHS
should be based on local expertise (Recommendation grade D); en￾doscopic drainage should be performed in high volume centers with
experienced endoscopists and multidisciplinary teams (Recom￾mendation grade C).
One debatable RCT and two retrospective studies compared en￾doscopic vs. percutaneous drainage of MHS using plastic or metal
stents [95–97]. These studies included patients with strictures of
Bismuth type 2 /3 [96], 3 /4 [97], and 2 /3 /4 [95]. They showed
that percutaneous drainage of MHS has a higher success rate
and a lower incidence of infective complications. The method of
biliary drainage was not thoroughly detailed in any of these stud￾ies but biliary ducts were left opacified and undrained in all of
them. This is no longer standard of care [98, 99]. Noninfective
complications (bleeding, pancreatitis) were more frequent in the
percutaneous groups [95, 97].
High volume hospitals have a higher success rate at ERCP than
low volume hospitals [14]. Endoscopic stenting in MHS is consid￾ered to be an advanced procedure according to the modified
Schutz’s score [100]. Technical failure of endoscopic drainage of
MHS is reported in up to 20 % of cases [95, 96], and several studies
stressed that drainage of complex MHS requires experienced en￾doscopists [14, 95, 96]. Prompt availability of percutaneous access
in the immediate environment of the endoscopic unit is manda￾tory if the endoscopic route is selected, due to the high incidence
of infective complications after attempted endoscopic biliary
drainage and the much shorter survival reported after failure at
initial drainage attempt, whatever the route [97].
MRI seems to be slightly more accurate than CT for assessing the level
of obstruction in MHS; both methods allow measurement of the vol￾ume of liver lobes. This ductal and parenchymal information is use￾ful for directing palliative drainage of MHS (Evidence level 2 +). We
recommend performance of MRI to assess the hepatobiliary anato￾my before attempting drainage of MHS (Recommendation grade C).

According to studies with limited sample size, MRI allows identi￾fication of the level and longitudinal extent of MHS with 90 % ac￾curacy [90, 101], as compared with 75 % for multidetector-row CT
[102]. Measurement of liver volumes by CT and MRI is similarly
effective [103]. Information obtained by magnetic resonance
cholangiography can help guiding endoscopic MHS drainage to
limit infective complications [99, 104].
After bilateral biliary opacification upstream from MHS, morbidity
and mortality rates are higher with unilateral compared with bi￾lateral biliary drainage (Evidence level 2–). A low incidence of cho￾langitis has consistently been achieved when specific endoscopic
techniques were used to target drainage to duct(s) selected on the
basis of MRI or CT (Evidence level 2 +). Draining > 50 % of the liver
volume is associated with higher drainage effectiveness and longer
survival than draining < 50 % of the liver volume (Evidence level
2–).
In MHS, the liver sector(s) to be drained should be selected before be￾ginning ERCP, based on MRI or CT, with the aim of draining > 50 % of
the liver volume. Bile duct(s) unintentionally opacified upstream
from an MHS should be drained during the same procedure. Anti￾biotics should be administered in case of anticipated incomplete
biliary drainage and, if drainage proves to be incomplete, they
should be continued until complete drainage is achieved (Recom￾mendation grade C).
In a recent retrospective study, endoscopic drainage of more than
50 % of the liver volume in patients with MHS was independently
associated with a greater decrease in the bilirubin level, a lower
incidence of early cholangitis, and a longer patient survival than
endoscopic drainage of less than 50 % of the liver volume [105]. If
contrast dye is injected upstream from an MHS into peripheral
hepatic ducts that are not subsequently drained, cholangitis is ex￾tremely frequent [98, 106]. To reduce the risk of cholangitis, en￾doscopic insertion of a single stent into the most accessible bili￾ary system has been proposed for the palliation of MHS [107]. A
low rate of post-procedure cholangitis (0–6 %) was observed in
three single-arm prospective trials that used MRI or CT as a
“road map” to enable injection and drainage of only the largest
intercommunicating segmental ducts upstream from an MHS,
using contrast-free duct cannulation or anterograde endoscopic
duct opacification [104, 108, 109].
Four studies that used the endoscopic (n = 3) or the percutaneous
(n = 1) route for biliary drainage compared unilateral with bilater￾al drainage of MHS.A trend for a longer survival and a lower inci￾dence of cholangitis was found after bilateral compared with uni￾lateral drainage [98, 106 ,110, 111]. All of these studies present
two biases, namely the inclusion of patients with Bismuth–Corl￾ette type I MHS (one stent is enough to drain both liver lobes),
and the use of inappropriate numbers of stents to drain the opa￾cified intrahepatic ducts (bilateral drainage of Bismuth–Corlette
type III or IV MHS leaves undrained ducts).
Antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended in patients with antici￾pated incomplete biliary drainage, and it should be continued in
the case of incomplete biliary drainage [112].
Plastic stents and uncovered SEMSs yield similar short-term results
in patients with MHS but SEMSs provide a longer biliary patency
compared with plastic stents (only uncovered SEMSs are used in
this setting to prevent occlusion of side branches) (Evidence level
1–). Plastic stenting is recommended as long as no definitive deci￾sion about curative/palliative treatment has been taken. If a deci￾sion for palliative treatment is taken, insertion of SEMSs is recom￾mended in patients with life expectancy > 3 months or with biliary
infection (Recommendation grade B).
Only one RCT (using the percutaneous route) and one prospec￾tive observational study (using primarily the endoscopic route)
have compared plastic stents with SEMSs for MHS drainage;
they showed longer patency and less need for reintervention
with SEMSs compared with plastic stents [113, 114]. Endoscopic
insertion of multiple SEMSs in MHS is technically demanding and
is facilitated by new thinner SEMS delivery catheters and duode￾noscopes with larger working channels [1, 115, 116]. Plastic stent
insertion is recommended in MHS for which a decision for pallia￾tion has not been taken, because removal of uncovered SEMSs is
usually not possible.
SEMSs do not impede light delivery for photodynamic therapy but
adjustments of the light dose are required (Evidence Level 2 + +).
Trans-SEMS photodynamic therapy for palliation of malignant hi￾lar strictures should be administered in centers with well-trained
personnel (Recommendation grade D).
Photodynamic therapy for unresectable hilar cholangiocarcino￾ma was shown to prolong survival in two RCTs that included pa￾tients treated with plastic stents, and also in a non-randomized
controlled study that included patients treated with biliary
SEMSs [117–119]. During photodynamic therapy, endoscopic
light delivery requires temporary removal of plastic stents or, if
biliary SEMSs have been inserted, adjustment of the light dose
to compensate for reduced transmittance of light [120].
Stent dysfunction in patients with MHS is treated as follows: plas￾tic stents are removed, ducts are cleaned and new stents are inser￾ted; uncovered SEMSs are cleaned and, in the case of persistent
stricture, new stents are inserted. The choice between plastic stents
or SEMSs for re-stenting is based on the degree of biliary infection
and the life expectancy (Recommendation grade D).
Dysfunction of plastic stents in MHS is treated by stent removal
followed by cleaning of debris from the duct and insertion of a
new stent. Re-insertion of a stent into the duct previously stented
may be facilitated by stent removal “over the guidewire.” In the
presence of thick bile/pus, insertion of a SEMS (or a nasobiliary
drain that allows for repeated flushing) can be considered, to
avoid the early clogging that may occur with a plastic stent.
Uncovered SEMSs cannot be removed from a few days after inser￾tion. Depending on the cause of the SEMS dysfunction, treatment
consists of removal of debris from the SEMS lumen or insertion of
a new stent. To facilitate SEMS cannulation in patients with mul￾tiple SEMSs, these stents are best positioned with their distal ex￾tremity in the duodenum or, if they are side-by-side in the CBD,
at exactly the same level in the CBD [121].
9.2. Benign strictures
In the case of benign CBD strictures, temporary simultaneous
placement of multiple plastic stents is technically feasible in > 90 %
of patients; it is the endoscopic technique that provides the highest
long-term biliary patency rate (90 % for postoperative biliary stric￾tures and 65 % for those complicating chronic pancreatitis); it re￾quires a mean of approximately four ERCPs over a 12-month peri￾od. Possible stricture recurrences after this treatment are usually
successfully re-treated by ERCP. Temporary placement of single
plastic stents provides poorer patency rates; treatment with un￾covered SEMSs is plagued by a high long-term morbidity; tempor￾ary placement of covered SEMSs is an investigational option that
needs to be carefully evaluated by long-term follow-up studies (Evi￾dence level 1 +).
In patients with benign CBD strictures, we recommend temporary
placement of multiple plastic stents provided that the patient con￾sents and is thought likely to be compliant with repeat interven￾Dumonceau J-M et al. ESGE Clinical Guideline for biliary stenting… Endoscopy 2012; 44: 277–298

tions. The insertion of uncovered biliary SEMSs is strongly discour￾aged (Recommendation grade A). Covered SEMSs are a promising
alternative for selected benign CBD strictures. Because of the risk
of fatal septic complications, a recall system should be set up for
the care of patients who do not present for ERCP at scheduled dates
(Recommendation grade D).
Benign biliary strictures for which endoscopic treatment is pro￾posed are mostly related to liver transplantation or chronic pan￾creatitis (one third of cases each) and, less frequently, to other
causes (e. g., cholecystectomy, sphincterotomy); about 85 % of
these strictures are located at the level of the CBD [122]. Stric￾tures related to chronic pancreatitis are the most difficult to treat,
in particular if calcifications are present in the pancreatic head:
they recur in approximately one third of patients after temporary
insertion of multiple plastic stents simultaneously or of covered
SEMSs, and in two thirds of cases after temporary dilation using
a single plastic stent [123–126].
Systematic reviews of stenting for benign biliary strictures
showed that: (i) clinical success was most frequently observed
with temporary simultaneous placement of multiple plastic
stents (94 %), followed by placement of uncovered SEMSs (80 %),
and by placement of a single plastic stent (60 %); (ii) complica￾tions were more frequent with uncovered SEMSs (40 %) compar￾ed with single plastic stents (36 %) and multiple plastic stents (20
%); (iii) the patency of uncovered biliary SEMSs sharply decreased
over time from 1 year after SEMS insertion; (iv) management of
late occlusion of uncovered biliary SEMS frequently necessitated
surgery, percutaneous drainage, or unconventional endoscopic
procedures (e. g., brachytherapy) [58, 122].
●" Table 3 summarizes the treatment of benign biliary strictures
with temporary simultaneous placement of multiple plastic
stents in eight series, of which three were prospective [123, 127,
128]. Long-term success was ≥85 % except in two series that in￾cluded patients with strictures related to chronic pancreatitis.
Possible stricture recurrence after treatment with multiple plas￾tic stents has usually been successfully re-treated with ERCP
[129, 130]. Stent exchange was scheduled at 3-month intervals
in most series but a retrospective comparative study found that
cholangitis was similarly rare in patients with exchange of multi￾ple plastic biliary stents scheduled within 6 months (n = 52) com￾pared with 6 months or longer after placement (n = 22) [45].
Other authors have attempted to shorten stenting duration by ex￾changing stents with a higher number of stents every 2 weeks,
with 87 % success at 1 year post stent removal [128]. As some
models of covered SEMSs may consistently be extracted, tempor￾ary insertion of a fully covered SEMS is attractive for achieving a
dilation of large diameter in a single ERCP procedure [131–133].
However, limitations of this technique are emerging [134].
In patients with chronic pancreatitis and alcohol abuse, compli￾ance with stent exchange is problematic: in two series involving
43 patients, 70 % of patients had stent-related complications (fatal
in 5 % of cases) because they did not present for scheduled stent
exchanges [125, l35]. Hepaticojejunostomy remains a valid op￾tion for noncompliant patients with alcoholic chronic pancreati￾tis or if the stricture does not respond to multiple plastic stent￾ing.
●" Table 4 summarizes the treatment of benign biliary strictures
with temporary placement of covered SEMSs. Two studies enrol￾led patients with heterogeneous benign strictures and did not
have a detailed subgroup analysis [133, 136]. Similar success rates
for SEMS removal were reported with fully covered and partially
covered models, except in a small study that reported a low suc￾cess rate with fully covered SEMSs [137]. The rate of immediate
resolution for benign biliary strictures after covered SEMS re￾moval (~ 80 %) seems promising. Nevertheless, at short-term fol￾low-up (< 2 years), persistent stricture resolution was reported
in only 50–80 % of patients with benign biliary strictures related
to chronic pancreatitis and to orthotopic liver transplant [75,
131, 132, 137]. Very few data are available about the treatment
of postoperative biliary strictures with covered SEMSs. Therefore,
the use of covered SEMSs to treat benign biliary strictures should
be reserved to clinical trials that aim to identify the type of stent
and of stricture associated with the greatest long-term benefit
from this treatment.
9.3. Bile leaks
In the absence of transection of the CBD, endoscopic treatment
(biliary sphincterotomy or temporary drainage associated with re￾moval of any potentially associated biliary obstacle) allows healing
of more than 90 % of biliary leaks. Biliary stenting provides faster
leak resolution than sphincterotomy alone; it is equally effective
whether sphincterotomy is performed or not. Biliary sphincterot￾omy is associated with a risk of short-term and long-term compli￾cations, particularly in young patients (Evidence level 1 +). In the
case of temporary biliary stenting, biliary abnormalities (mostly
sludge, stones, or persistent leak) can be found at the time of stent
removal in a significant proportion of patients (Evidence level 2–).
We recommend discussing the advantages and inconveniences of
available treatment options with the patient before ERCP (e. g., the
need for repeat ERCP in the case of stenting). At ERCP, one should
pay particular attention to locating the leak and to detection of po￾tentially associated biliary lesions or obstacles (e. g., retained stone)
that require specific treatment. In the absence of such lesions, we
recommend insertion of a plastic biliary stent without perform￾ance of sphincterotomy, and removal of the stent 4 to 8 weeks later.
Endoscopic sphincterotomy alone is an alternative option, in
particular in elderly patients (Recommendation grade B). At the
time of stent removal, cholangiography and duct cleansing should
be performed (Recommendation grade D).
Bile leaks are most often a consequence of surgery (cholecystect￾omy, liver transplantation, and major liver surgery) or other trau￾ma. Endoscopic treatment is most often effective except in the
case of biliary transection; it aims to suppress the pressure gradi￾ent between the biliary tree and the duodenum to promote pre￾ferential bile flow into the duodenum and to allow for leak seal￾ing. This can be achieved through biliary stenting, biliary sphinc￾terotomy, or nasobiliary drainage, with the two latter options
precluding the need for repeat ERCP. Biliary sphincterotomy
may be associated with short-term and long-term complications
in 15 % of cases [140].
Sandha et al. have proposed an algorithm in which biliary sphinc￾terotomy was performed to treat mild leaks (i. e., requiring intra￾hepatic duct filling to identify the leak), and temporary biliary
stenting (4–6 weeks) was done for severe leaks or in case of stric￾ture, contraindication to sphincterotomy, or inadequate drainage
of contrast medium after sphincterotomy [141]. This strategy
yielded satisfactory results in > 90 % of 207 consecutive patients.
Two prospective studies involving 56 patients in total showed
that, in the absence of biliary stricture, sphincterotomy (associat￾ed with stone extraction if applicable) was followed by bile leak
sealing in approximately 90 % of patients; in one study, healing
was delayed at a mean of 11 days [142, 143]. An RCT in dogs
showed that biliary stenting allowed post-cholecystectomy cystic
leaks to seal more rapidly than did biliary sphincterotomy [144].

Various strategies of biliary stenting yielded similar results in
two RCTs (globally, 112 of 115 patients [97 %] had successful
treatment): one RCT compared 4-week stenting using either a
10-Fr or a 7-Fr stent (after biliary sphincterotomy) [145]; the
other RCT compared biliary drainage using either a 7-Fr stent
without biliary sphincterotomy or a 10-Fr stent with biliary
sphincterotomy [8].
A large retrospective study found abnormalities in approximately
one fourth of patients at cholangiography performed after re￾moval of stents inserted for post-cholecystectomy bile leaks
[146]. These consisted of CBD sludge or stones as well as persist￾ent bile leaks. Therefore, cholangiography with a balloon sweep
is preferred over a simple duodenoscopy for removing the biliary
stent.
9.4. Temporary stenting for biliary stones
In patients with irretrievable biliary stones, insertion of a plastic
stent is effective in the short term to drain the bile ducts; it is fre￾quently associated with partial (or even complete) stone dissolu￾tion that facilitates delayed endoscopic stone removal in most cases
(Evidence level 1–). Addition of oral ursodeoxycholic acid does not
increase the stone dissolution rate (Evidence level 1–) but a combi￾nation of oral ursodeoxycholic acid and terpene could be more ef￾fective (Evidence level 2–). Morbidity/mortality is high in the case
of long-term biliary stenting (Evidence level 1 +).
If ERCP fails to remove difficult biliary stones or is contraindicated,
temporary (e. g., 3-month) plastic stenting should be considered.
After biliary stent placement, the patient and referring physicians
should be warned that, when used as a long-term measure, biliary
stent placement is associated with a high risk of cholangitis (Re￾commendation grade B). Addition of oral ursodeoxycholic acid
associated with terpene should be considered (Recommendation
grade D).
Biliary stone extraction using standard techniques fails in 5–10 %
of cases, necessitating the use of lithotripsy or large-balloon bili￾ary dilation. If these techniques fail or cannot be used (e. g., be￾cause of dual antiplatelet agents therapy that cannot be discon￾tinued) [70], biliary stenting is a quick alternative option. It is ef￾fective for draining the bile ducts and it is associated with partial
or complete stone dissolution in > 50 % of cases, facilitating subse￾quent extraction [147–149]. Stenting should be temporary only
as complications (including death in up to 6.7–16 %) are frequent
during long follow-up (34–40 %) [150]. In one prospective study
that included 20 patients, it has been suggested that double-pig￾tail stents of 7-Fr with the proximal pigtail wrapped around the
stone ensured more effective lithotripsy (complete or partial
stone dissolution was noted in 70 % of the patients at second
ERCP 6 months later) [151]. Similar findings were reported in a
more recent retrospective study of 40 patients [152].
Addition of oral ursodeoxycholic acid to biliary stenting was
shown in an RCT to be ineffective for improving stone dissolution
[153]. Two uncontrolled studies have suggested that addition of
oral ursodeoxycholic acid plus a terpene preparation to biliary
stenting might increase the stone dissolution rate [149, 154].

ESGE guidelines represent a consensus of best practice based on
the available evidence at the time of preparation. They may not
apply in all situations and should be interpreted in the light of
