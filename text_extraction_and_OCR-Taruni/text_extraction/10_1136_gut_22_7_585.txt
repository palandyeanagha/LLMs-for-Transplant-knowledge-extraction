Renal failure in fulminant hepatic failure and terminal
cirrhosis: a comparison between incidence, types, and
prognosis
H RING-LARSEN,* AND U PALAZZO
From the Division of Hepatology, Medical Department, A, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark
SUMMARY Forty patients with terminal cirrhosis and 40 patients with fulminant hepatic failure￾all consecutively admitted-were studied with regard to incidence, types, and prognosis of com￾plicating renal insufficiency. Renal failure was considered present when the serum creatinine was
>0-20 mmol/l. Of the patients with cirrhosis 26 (65%) developed renal failure. In 15 the type was
functional, in three due to acute tubular necrosis, and in eight indeterminable. Of the patients with
fulminant hepatic failure 22 (55%) had renal insufficiency; of these 13 had functional renal failure,
five acute tubular necrosis, and in four the type was indeterminable. In both categories of patients,
renal failure was equally frequent among patients with or without gastrointestinal bleeding and
with or without ascites or diuretic therapy. The biochemical tests of liver function were similar in
patients with or without renal failure in both categories. The mean renal blood flow in seven
unselected patients with fulminant hepatic failure was reduced in the same order as previously
observed in patients with cirrhosis. In terminal cirrhosis the mortality rate was 88% in the presence
of renal failure, 71% in its absence (P>0.05), while the same figures in fulminant hepatic failure
were 100% and 67% (P<0.05). The incidence, relative frequency, and prognosis of renal failure
were not different in the two conditions, indicating identical pathophysiological circumstances.
Renal failure is a frequent complication in advanced
liver disease. ' 2 In cirrhosis, the kidney insufficiency is
most often of functional nature and carries a poor
prognosis.3 The pathogenetic mechanism seems to be
reduction of the renal blood flow, the aetiology of
which remains obscure.4 However, data on the
relative frequency of different types of renal failure in
terminal cirrhosis are scarce.
Fulminant hepatic failure may also be worsened by
renal insufficiency. However, little is known about
the frequency, nature, and prognosis of the renal
damage in acute liver failure.78
The objective of the present study was to compare
the incidence, types, and prognosis of renal failure in
terminal cirrhosis and fulminant hepatic failure.

secutively admitted to Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen.
The mean age of the cirrhotic patients, 19 women and
21 men, was 51 years (range 25-71 years). Alcoholic
cirrhosis was present in 20, idiopathic cirrhosis in 18,
and primary biliary cirrhosis in two. In the cases with
fulminant hepatitis, comprising 23 women and 17
men, the mean age was 43 years (range 16-17 years).
Viral hepatitis was assumed to be the cause in 29,
multiple exposure to halothane in eight, and toxic
hepatitis possibly due to disulfiram in three patients.
The diagnoses were assessed by liver biopsy or
necropsy in all cases. Patients with a history of renal
disease were excluded from the study.
The patients were studied from the time they
lapsed into hepatic coma grade III-IV at which time
current diuretic therapy was discontinued in virtually
all cases-and during the subsequent days untildeath
or recovery. Diureses, serum and urine creatinine,
sodium, and potassium were recorded daily. Renal
failure was defined as a serum creatinine concentra￾tion above 0.20 mmol/l not due to dehydration, which
was avoided in all patients. Terminal azotaemia￾that is, a rise in the serum creatinine concentration

occurred in seven, while among 29 patients without
bleeding renal failure was present in 19 (P>0-20). Of
the seven patients with renal failure and preceding
gastrointestinal bleeding three had functional renal
failure, one acute tubular necrosis, and three the
indeterminable type of renal failure.
Renal failure was equally frequent in patients with
and without ascites, 17 of 26 and nine of 14 respec￾tively (P>0.20). However, among the 15 patients with
functional renal failure only two were without clinical
signs of sodium and water retention or without
diuretic therapy to prevent recurrence of ascites.
However, diuretic therapy-before coma II-IV￾was not associated with any significant increase in the
frequency of renal failure. Of 15 patients receiving
diuretic treatment before lapsing into hepatic coma
the renal function improved in one, while in the
others it remained unchanged or progressed, as
judged by a further increase in serum creatinine, even
though diuretics had been discontinued.
The serum sodium concentration was significantly
lower in patients with renal failure than in patients
with normal kidney function (mean values 128 and
133 mmol/l, P<005). Among the patients with renal
failure the mean serum sodium concentration was 131
mmol/l in patients without ascites, 129 mmol/l in the
presence of ascites, and 119 mmol/l in those on
diuretic therapy.
The biochemical tests of liver function showed no
difference between patients with and without renal
failure. Only three patients with renal failure (12%)
survived the acute exacerbation and were discharged,
while four (29%) of the patients without this com￾plication survived (P>0-20). All patients with gastro￾intestinal bleeding died. When patients with this
complication were excluded, the mortality rate of the
patients with or without renal failure was 84 and 60%
respectively (P>0.20). Peritoneal dialysis was carried
out in eight patients and, although this treatment
complemented renal function as judged by the fall in
serum creatinine, none of the patients survived.
FULMINANT HEPATIC FAILURE
Clinical and biochemical data on the patients with
fulminant hepatic failure are shown in Tables 3 and 4.
At the time of coma, renal failure was present in 15
patients, serum creatinine being mean 0.53 mmol/l.
Another seven patients developed renal failure from
two to eight days thereafter. Five patients had acute
tubular necrosis, 13 functional renal failure, while
four patients had renal failure which was indetermin￾able-in two cases because of insufficient data and in
two because of data conflicting according to the
criteria mentioned. Of three patients with initially
indeterminable type the renal failure turned out to be
functional in one and due to acute tubular necrosis in
two. In none of the cases could the therapeutic pro￾cedures be considered as likely aetiological factors of
renal failure.
Renal failure was more frequent among patients
who had bled from the gastrointestinal tract. Of 10
patients with this complication, renal failure occurred
in eight, while, of 30 patients without gastrointestinal
bleeding, renal failure occurred in 14. However,
the difference was statistically insignificant
(0-20>P>0-10). Of the eight patients with gastro￾intestinal bleeding and renal failure seven had
functional renal failure and one acute tubular
necrosis.
Renal failure was more frequent in the presence of
ascites but the difference was insignificant: nine of 11
and 13 of 29 respectively (0 10>P>005). Unlike the
findings in cirrhotic patients, of the 13 patients with
functional renal failure only four had ascites. Diuretic
therapy was not associated with any increase in the
frequency of renal failure. The renal function did not

Renal failure in fulminant hepatic failure and terminal cirrhosis
improve in relation to discontinuing diuretics in the
four patients receiving this treatment before lapsing
into hepatic coma.
The serum sodium concentration was significantly
(P<0-05) lower in patients with renal failure than in
patients with normal kidney function (mean values
129 and 137 mmol/l). Among the patients with renal
failure the mean serum sodium concentration was
134 mmol/l in those without ascites, 124 mmol/l in
patients with this complication, and 121 mmol/l
in those treated with diuretics.
The biochemical tests of liver function showed no
difference between patients with or without renal
failure.
None of the patients with renal failure survived,
while six of the patients without this complication
were discharged (P<002). When patients with
gastrointestinal bleeding were excluded, the mortality
rate of the patients without renal failure was 56%.
Nine patients with considerably raised serum crea￾tinine in whom there was sufficient time for therapy
were treated by peritoneal dialysis. Judged by the
laboratory data this treatment was effective, but it did
not influence the survival rate.
In seven unselected patients with fulminant
hepatic failure, the mean renal blood flow was
1.40 ml/g/min compared with 3.34 ml/g/min in eight
controls (P<0-05) (Figure).

included, and paracetamol intoxication, which can
possibly be a specific cause of renal damage,'7 was
absent.
Even when renal histology is available, the differ￾entiation between functional renal failure and acute
tubular necrosis may be difficult, as post mortem
kidney microscopy is generally hard to evaluate'8 and
as 'acute tubular necrosis', despite the terminology,
may present itself with extremely minute pathological
changes similar to those in functional renal failure.'9
Casts in the urine sediment are likewise of limited
value, as this is not an obligatory finding in acute
tubular necrosis and as hyaline and granular casts in
the urine are often present in advanced liver disease
unrelated to impairment of renal function.20

COMPARISON
The incidence and relative frequency of different
types of renal insufficiency were not different in
terminal cirrhosis and fulminant hepatic failure. The
prognosis in the case of renal failure was not signific￾antly different in the two groups.
Discussion
The present results assess the high incidence of renal
failure in terminal cirrhosis and confirm the clinical
impression of renal failure as a traditional complica￾tion in fulminant hepatic failure. Moreover, the
results establish a similarity in the relative frequency
of different types of renal insufficiency, in prognosis,
and in pattern of renal hypoperfusion in the two
groups of patients.
The frequency of renal failure in cirrhosis depends
on the stage of the disease and the criteria used for
defining the condition. However, terminally in the
disease the incidence seems to be about 75%12-14
The frequency of complicating renal failure in
fuhninant hepatic failure cannot be readily
assessed.'5 16 The present incidence of 55% is
significantly less than that of 79 observed by
Wilkinson et al.8 in a comparable study. Several
reasons could account for the discrepancy. In the

At present, the differentiation between functional
renal failure and other types of renal failure occurring
in liver disease rests on few criteria-namely, urine
sodium concentration, kidney concentration ability,
and response to volume expansion.9 It has been
suggested that the difference between the two types
of renal insufficiency in liver disease may be quantita￾tive rather than qualitative, in that tubular function
appears to be maintained until renal perfusion
decreases to a degree where tubular necrosis occur.2'

study.
The relative frequency of different types of renal
failure in terminal cirrhosis is unknown. In a prospec￾tive study of 15 patients with cirrhosis and renal
failure Shear et al.22 found indications of acute
tubular necrosis in eight. The diagnoses were, how￾ever, partly based on urine sediment and a suspicion
of precipitating events. Moreover, in several of these
patients, specific gravity of the urine was higher
and urine sodium concentration lower than would be
expected in acute tubular necrosis.
The relative frequency of different types of renal
insufficiency in fulminant hepatic failure was studied
by Mas et al., 6 who found acute tubular necrosis in
two of six patients, the rest having functional renal
failure. Wilkinson et al., 8on the other hand, reported
acute tubular necrosis in the majority of patients with
renal failure in the course of fulminant hepatic
failure. This contrast with the present results is not
readily explained, except perhaps by the great
number of paracetamol poisonings among their
patients.
Gastrointestinal bleeding and forced diuresis may
cause renal failure of both types in cirrhosis as well as
fulminant hepatic failure.7.22-24 Such a trend was
observed in the present study but did not turn out to
be statistically significant, confirming that functional
renal failure in hepatic insufficiency most often occurs
without any precipitating events. Ascites, which has
been regarded an integral part of the clinical picture
in functional renal failure in advanced liver disease, l 8
was absent in one-third of the patients with terminal
cirrhosis and in most patients with fulminant hepatic
failure, which indicates that portal hypertension is
perhaps not a prerequisite for functional renal failure
in either condition.
Mean renal blood flow in patients with fulminant
hepatic failure apparently equals that of non￾comatose cirrhotic patients with azotaemia.6 This
finding indicates that identical pathophysiological
circumstances may be present in terminal cirrhosis
and fulminant hepatic failure.25
It is widely considered that the mortality in renal
failure in cirrhosis is close to %....222627 and that
spontaneous recovery is exceptional.28 An equally
high mortality rate has been observed in fulminant
hepatic failure but, unlike what is seen in cirrhotic
patients, without any apparent difference between
patients with or without renal failure.'6 However,
such a difference was significant in the present study.
Results from peritoneal dialysis in cirrhosis have been
disappointing,29 but an uncontrolled study of this
treatment in fulminant hepatic failure complicated
with renal insufficiency did improve survival.30 Such
optimism cannot be supported by the present data.
The importance of concomitant renal failure in
severe liver disease as being a determinant of the poor
prognosis is difficult to evaluate. It is probably correct
to consider that the vasoconstriction in the kidneys
leading to renal failure-in cirrhosis as well as in
fulminant hepatic failure-is part of an extensive
lethal event that includes haemodynamic collapse in
the progressive course of hepatic insufficiency, the
latter determing the outcome of the disease. How￾ever, whether the renal hypoperfusion is primary￾for example, caused by agents with vasoconstrictor
properties`-`or secondary to decreased systemic
vascular resistance remains to be resolved. Recent
studies may indicate that the latter hypothesis is
correct. `
