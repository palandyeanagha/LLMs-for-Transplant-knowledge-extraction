Abstract. Cardioplegic reperfusion during a long‑term ischemic 
period interrupts cardiac surgery and increases cellular edema due 
to repeated administration. The present clinical study compared 
the protective effects of histidine‑ketoglutarate‑tryptophan 
(HTK) solution and St. Thomas crystalloid cardioplegia. 
Clinical experiences of the myocardial protection induced by 
one single perfusion with HTK were reviewed in high‑risk 
patients with severe pulmonary arterial hypertension associated 
with complex congenital heart disease. This retrospective 
study included 88 high‑risk patients (aortic cross‑clamp time, 
>120 min) between March 2001 and July 2012. The cohort 
was divided into two groups according to the technique used. 
Either myocardial protection was performed with one single 
perfusion with HTK solution (HTK group) or with conventional 
St. Thomas crystalloid cardioplegia (St group). The duration 
of cardiopulmonary bypass did not differ between the two 
groups. The mortality, morbidity, intensive care unit (ICU) stay, 
postoperative hospitalization, and transfusions of HTK group 
are significantly lower than those of the St group (P<0.05). 
Univariate and multivariate analysis demonstrated that HTK 
is a statistically significant independent predictor of decreased 
early mortality and morbidity (P<0.05). In conclusion, the 
present findings suggested that HTK solution decreases 
mortality, morbidity, ICU stay, postoperative hospitalization, 
and transfusions in high‑risk patients with severe pulmonary 
arterial hypertension associated with complex congenital heart 
disease.
Introduction
With the development of cardiac surgery, an increasing number 
of high‑risk patients with complex congenital heart disease have 
undergone cardiac surgery (1,2). Ischemia‑reperfusion injury 
during cardiac surgery is associated with increased mortality 
and morbidity. The improvement of myocardium tolerance 
to ischemia for high‑risk patients with complex congenital 
heart disease is a key issue (3). However, the optimal myocar￾dial protection strategy for high‑risk patients with complex 
congenital heart disease remains controversial (1,4). There are 
two main groups of cardioplegic solutions; one is based on 
extracellular components with high potassium, magnesium and 
bicarbonate levels and the other is based on intracellular electro￾lytes. The histidine‑ketoglutarate‑tryptophan (HTK) solution, 
which is based on intracellular electrolytes, was introduced by 
Preusse et al in 1981 (5). A single‑dose strategy for myocar￾dial protection, which avoids interrupting the procedure to 
re‑administer cardioplegia, is preferable during lengthy surgery.
Histidine, tryptophane and ketoglutarate are the components 
of HTK solution. Histidine has a buffer effect and may enhance 
the efficiency of anaerobic glycolysis, tryptophane stabilizes the 
cell membrane and the addition of mannitol decreases cellular 
oedema, whereas ketoglutarate is a precursor of nicotinamide 
adenine dinucleotide (6). Several studies have demonstrated the 
efficacy of the HTK solution based on biochemical markers or 
physiological evaluation in experimental models (7‑9). HTK 
solution helps to preserve myocardial adenosine triphosphate 
stores, improve post‑arrest contractile function and minimize 
myocardial necrosis (10,11). HTK solution has also been shown 
to preserve the coronary artery endothelium, which may help to 
improve functional cardiac recovery (12,13). Careaga et al (14) 
reported that patients treated with HTK solution had a lower 
incidence of arrhythmias, length‑of‑stay in the intensive care 
unit (ICU) and inotropic support, postoperatively.

2678 LIN et al: COMPARISON OF HTK AND ST. THOMAS CRYSTALLOID CARDIOPLEGIA
It was hypothesized that a single‑dose of HTK may provide 
superior myocardial protection than cold crystalloid cardio￾plegia in high‑risk patients. The present clinical study compared 
the protective effects of HTK Solution and St. Thomas crystal￾loid cardioplegia in high‑risk patients with severe pulmonary 
arterial hypertension associated with complex congenital heart 
disease.
Materials and methods
Patients. Cardiac catheterization data was collected from 
patients under general anesthesia. Severe pulmonary arte￾rial hypertension was defined as mean pulmonary pressure 
>50 mmHg or systolic pulmonary/systemic pressure ratio >0.8. 
A total of 88 high‑risk patients (47 males, 48 females; aortic 
cross‑clamp time, >120 min) aged >6 months (3.17±3.36 years) 
with dextro‑transposition of the great arteries (d‑TGA) and 
nonrestrictive ventricular septal defect or Taussig‑Bing anomaly 
and severe pulmonary arterial hypertension who underwent 
arterial switch surgery (two ventricles repair) at Fuwai Hospital 
between March 2001 and July 2012 were included in the study. 
Patients were divided into two groups: HTK group (myocardial 
protection was performed with a single perfusion of HTK solu￾tion) and the St group (control group; myocardial protection 
with conventional St. Thomas cold potassium cardioplegia) 
(Table I). Inclusion criteria included: Patients aged >6 months 
who were diagnosed as d‑TGA and nonrestrictive ventricular 
septal defect or Taussig‑Bing anomaly and severe pulmonary 
arterial hypertension. Exclusion criteria included: Patients aged 
<6 months; mean pulmonary arterial pressure <50 mmHg or 
systolic pulmonary/systemic pressure ratio <0.8; or 21 trisomy. 
Diagnosis (according to the International Congenital Heart 
Surgery Nomenclature) was made on the basis of echocardio￾graphic and cardiac angiographic findings and was confirmed 
during surgery. Hospital charts, echocardiographic and cardiac 
catheterization data and operative reports were reviewed. 
Cardiac catheterization was performed under general anes￾thesia. Preoperative pulmonary artery pressure and pulmonary 
vascular resistance were measured according to the conventional 
cardiac catheterization protocol and Fick method (15,16) The 
Medical Ethics Committee of Fuwai Cardiovascular Disease 
Hospital approved the study protocol, and approval was granted 
to waive the requirement for patient consent for publishing 
follow‑up data about the present patients.
Data collection. Clinical records of 88 high‑risk patients 
included in the present study were retrospectively reviewed. If a 
patient succumbed to their symptoms, their death certificate and 
the medical records of the hospital and physician were reviewed. 
In the present study, early mortality was defined as mortality 
prior to hospital discharge or within 30 days of arterial switch 
surgery.
Anesthesia management. Prior to surgery, anesthesia was 
induced with intravenous ketamine (1.5 mg/kg; Xi'an HanFeng 
Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd., Xi'an, China), fentanyl (30 µg/kg; 
Yichang Humanwell Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd., Yichang, China), 
and pancuronium (0.15 mg/k; Organon International, Oss, 
Netherlands). During surgery, fentanyl (0.3 µg·kg‑1·min‑1; 
Yichang Humanwell Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd.) was used for 
maintenance. An arterial line in the radial artery or femoral 
artery was used for hemodynamic monitoring. Specifically, a 
central venous pressure catheter was installed via the subclavian 
vein, and a urinary catheter was installed.
Cardiopulmonary bypass. Cardiopulmonary bypass was 
performed using a Dideco 901 or 902 hollow fiber oxygenator 
(Sorin Group, Mirandola, Italy), and a roller pump (Jostra 
GmbH, Munich, Germany) with non‑pulsatile flow. A tubing 
pack, which contained a crystalloid cardioplegia delivery 
system (Beijing Perfect Chemical Material Co. Ltd., Beijing, 
China) and an arterial clotting time was maintained above 
400 sec during cardiopulmonary bypass. Heparin (Shanghai 
No. 1 Biochemical Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China) 
was neutralized with protamine chloride (4 mg/kg) after cardio￾pulmonary bypass.
Infusion of cardioplegia. Under cardiopulmonary bypass and 
aortic cross‑clamping, cardioplegic arrest was induced. HTK 
solution (4‑8˚C) was perfused as a single dose (40‑50 ml/kg) via 
the aortic root at an initial perfusion pressure of 80‑100 mmHg. 
Infusion was maintained at 40‑60 mmHg over 5‑7 min. St. 
Thomas solution (4‑8˚C; initial dose, 20 ml/kg; maintenance 
dose, 10 ml/kg) was perfused (antegrade) every 30 min at a 
pressure of 100‑120 mmHg. Cardiopulmonary bypass time 
and aortic cross‑clamping time were recorded. The presence of 
arrhythmias during reperfusion after aortic cross‑clamping and 
during the postoperative period was evaluated.
Surgical technique. Median sternotomy and hypothermic 
cardiopulmonary bypass with ultrafiltration technique were 
routinely used. Cardioplegia solution was administered 
(HTK solution: 40‑50 ml/kg; St. Thomas solution: Initial 
dose 20 ml/kg, maintenance dose 10 ml/kg). Surgery 
was performed on cardiopulmonary bypass at low flow
(50 ml/kg/min) with a rectal temperature of 18‑22˚C. 
Ventricular and atrial septal defect and patent ductus arte￾riosus were completely closed. The aorta was transected 
and the aortic root was fully dissected. A large aortic button 
containing the coronary orifice was harvested. The pulmonary

trunk was transected, pulmonary branches dissected, and 
the Lecompte maneuver (17) was performed. The coronary 
artery was reimplanted to an appropriate site of the neo‑aorta. 
Pulmonary artery reconstruction was performed using a fresh 
autologous pantaloon‑shaped pericardial patch. Associated 
anomalies were corrected simultaneously. Associated anoma￾lies include patent ductus arteriosus, atrial septal defect, mild 
left ventricular outflow tract obstruction, mild right ventricular 
outflow tract obstruction, mitral insufficiency, tricuspid insuf￾ficiency, pulmonary veinstenosis, aortic arch coarctation, major 
aortopulmonary collaterals and anomalous origin of the right 
pulmonary artery from the ascending aorta. Postoperative 
pulmonary artery pressure measurements were recorded in the 
operating room at the end of the surgery.
Follow‑up. All survivors were followed‑up to the end date of 
the study (July 2012). All patients at the outpatient department 
were subjected to electrocardiogram, X‑ray chest film and 
echocardiogram analysis. Patients were followed‑up at the 
outpatient department once every three months. At the final 
follow‑up, patients were contacted by telephone or were directly 
interviewed at the outpatient department.
Statistical analysis. All analyses were performed using SPSS 
version 18.0 software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Continuous 
variables were expressed as mean ± standard error of the mean 
and were compared by a two‑tailed Student's t‑test. Survival rates 
were estimated using the Kaplan‑Meier method. Comparison of 
multiple mean values was performed by analysis of variance. 
Discrete variables were expressed as percentages and compared 
by Fisher's exact test or Pearson's χ2
 test, as required. End‑points 
of the study included prevalence and cause of hospital mortality, 
prevalence and cause of hospital morbidity, resource utilization 
(assisted ventilation, intensive care and blood transfusions) and 
postoperative hospital stay. Associations with perioperative risk 
factors were assessed by means of contingency table methods 
and logistic regression analysis. To explore the simultaneous 
effects of perioperative characteristics on early mortality, vari￾ables that were significant at the 0.1 level in univariate analysis 
were included in a multivariate logistic regression model. P<0.05 
was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference.

Results
Patients. Table II shows the demographic and operative data. 
Preoperative cardiac catheterization data were available for 
all patients. No significant differences were observed between 
any of the variables.
Mortality and morbidity. The mortality rate during surgery 
was 6/88. Mortality in the HTK group was significantly lower 
than that of the St group (2.8 vs. 22.2%; P=0.015), suggesting 
that HTK solution may decrease mortality. Multiple organ 
failure in HTK group was significantly lower than that in 
St group (0.0 vs. 11.1%; P=0.040), suggesting that the effect of 
organ preservasion of HTK solution is better than that of St. 
Thomas crystalloid cardioplegia. The incidence of morbidity 
in HTK group was significantly lower in than that in St group 
(20 vs. 66.7%; P<0.001; Table III), suggesting that HTK solu￾tion has better clinical effect than St. Thomas crystalloid 
cardioplegia.
Resource utilization. In the HTK group, the duration of ICU 
stay was significantly shorter than that of the St group (10.5±1.4 
vs. 20.1±4.4 days; P=0.009), suggesting that the clinical effect 
of HTK solution is better than that of St. Thomas crystalloid 
cardioplegia. The mean volume of transfusions for patients 
was significantly reduced in the HTK group (772.1±88.7 
vs. 1352.9±214.7 ml; P=0.007; Table IV); however, the reason 
for this remains to be elucidated.
Alterations in serum sodium in HTK group. Table V shows 
the changes of serum sodium observed in the HTK group. 
The results indicated that serum sodium in the HTK group 
decreased after clamping (P<0.001; Table V).
Spontaneous defibrillation. Following reperfusion, rates of 
spontaneous defibrillation in the HTK group were significantly 
higher than those of the St group (92.9 vs. 72.2%; P=0.027) 
(Table VI), indicating that the myocardial protection effect 
of HTK solution is superior to that of St. Thomas crystalloid 
cardioplegia.
Follow‑up results. Follow‑up was successfully completed by 
90.2% (74/82) of patients. The mean duration of follow‑up 
was 58.8±26.8 months; two late deaths (deaths that occurred 
>2 months post‑surgery) occurred due to sudden death with no 
known reason. The overall survival rate of patients in the present 
study was 97.3% (72/74). The latest follow‑up data showed that 
2.8% of survivors were in New York Heart Association Class II 
and 97.2% were in Class I, showing that the midterm results of 
the operation are excellent.
Analysis of risk factors associated with early mortality and 
morbidity. Both univariate and multivariate analysis showed 
that HTK was associated with decreased early mortality [odds 
ratio (OR=0.103, P=0.013 and OR=0.135, P=0.045, respectively) 
and morbidity (OR=0.132, P<0.001 and OR=0.097, P<0.001, 
respectively; Table VII). This strongly indicates that the 
myocardial protection effect of HTK solution is superior to that 
of St. Thomas crystalloid cardioplegia.
Discussion
Mortality and morbidity rates for high‑risk patients with complex 
congenital heart disease are relatively high; therefore, although 
it remains difficult, the optimal myocardial protection strategy 
for high‑risk patients should be urgently determined (6,18). Data 
collected from instances in which HTK solution has been used 
for high‑risk patients with complex congenital heart disease 
remains rare (19‑22).
A study of Fuwai Hospital compared the myocardial 
protective effect induced by HTK solution and conventional 
St. Thomas crystalloid cardioplegia on the long‑term 
ischemic period (cross‑clamping time, >90 min) during severe 
complex pediatric cardiac surgery without pulmonary arterial 
hypertension. The results demonstrated that mortality rates and 
the levels of CK in the HTK solution group were significantly 
lower, as compared with these values in the St. Thomas 
crystalloid cardioplegia group (P<0.05). Patients with severe 
pulmonary arterial hypertension associated with congenital 
heart disease are difficult to treat in clinic practice. Older patients

(aged >6 months) with complex congenital heart disease with 
severe pulmonary arterial hypertension are at a higher risk of 
developing postoperative pulmonary arterial hypertension (23). 
Postoperative pulmonary arterial hypertension is a major 
determinant of perioperative morbidity and mortality (24,25).
Conventional St. Thomas cold potassium cardioplegia 
solution is routinely used at Fuwai Hospital, and HTK solution 
is used in patients with complex congenital heart disease. A 
comparison of the myocardial protection of a single dose of HTK 
solution and St. Thomas crystalloid cardioplegia in high‑risk 
patients with severe pulmonary arterial hypertension associated 
with complex congenital heart disease may have more power to 
detect significant differences in myocardial protection between 
HTK solution and St. Thomas crystalloid cardioplegia. Older 
patients (aged >6 months) with complex congenital heart disease 
with severe pulmonary arterial hypertension were included in 
the present study, whereas patients without severe pulmonary 
arterial hypertension were excluded.
In the present 12‑year retrospective analysis of Fuwai 
Hospital, the mortality rate and incidence of morbidity in the 
HTK group was significantly lower than that of the St group, and 
the ICU stays of patients in the HTK group were significantly 
shorter than those in the St group. The mean volume of transfu￾sions for patients was significantly less in the HTK group, as 
compared with the St group. Following reperfusion, rates of 
spontaneous defibrillation in the HTK group were significantly 
higher than those observed in the St group. Univariate and 
multivariate analyses showed that HTK was associated with 
decreased early mortality and morbidity.
The present study demonstrated that HTK solution is 
more effective than the St. Thomas crystalloid cardioplegia at 
protecting the myocardium from ischemia. However, subse￾quent prospective randomized controlled trials in a uniform 
group of high‑risk patients are required to detect equivalence or 
important differences.
Blood cardioplegia has typically been used as the standard 
to protect the myocardium. Conventional St. Thomas crystalloid 
cardioplegia and blood cardioplegia must be repeated every 
20‑30 min and the surgical procedure must be suspended 
during infusion. An uninterrupted surgical field is desir￾able, and single‑dose cardioplegia may be preferable in more 
complex cardiac procedures to avoid disturbing the technical 
flow of the surgery. Del Nido cardioplegia was formulated to act 
as single‑dose administration in pediatric patients (26,27). Del 
Nido cardioplegia has not been widely used in Fuwai Hospital.
HTK induces fluctuations in sodium concentration, 
thus particular attention should be paid to low Na+
 levels. 
Hyponatremia becomes deleterious if osmolarity simulta￾neously becomes hypoosmolar. Aspirating HTK solution 
into a blood cell saver as much as possible avoids large 
volumes of HTK solution entering the cardiopulmonary 
bypass circuit, which would otherwise induce severe hypo￾natremia. Clinicians must avoid overtreatment of low sodium 
content to prevent severe neurologic complications. The 
application of small volumes (25‑100 ml) of NaCl (5.85%) or
NaHCO3 (8.4%) to the circuit is recommended in adults 
during cardioplegic delivery to counteract low blood sodium 
content (28).
In conclusion, the present study showed that HTK solution 
decreases mortality, morbidity, ICU stay, postoperative hospi￾talization, and transfusions in high‑risk patients with complex 
congenital heart disease. A prospective randomized controlled 
trial is required to determine the superior myocardial protec￾tive effects of HTK solution, as compared with conventional St. 
Thomas crystalloid cardioplegia.
