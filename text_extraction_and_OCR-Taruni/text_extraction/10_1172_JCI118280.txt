Abstract
To determine the effects of loading on active and passive
tensions, programmed cell death, superoxide anion forma￾tion, the expression of Fas on myocytes, and side-to-side
slippage of myocytes, papillary muscles were exposed to 7-
8 and 50 mN/mm2 and these parameters were measured
over a 3-h period. Overstretching produced a 21- and a
2.4-fold increase in apoptotic myocyte and nonmyocyte cell
death, respectively. Concurrently, the generation of reactive
oxygen species increased 2.4-fold and the number of myo￾cytes labeled by Fas protein 21-fold. Moreover, a 15% de￾crease in the number of myocytes included in the thickness
of the papillary muscle was found in combination with a 7%
decrease in sarcomere length and the inability of muscles to
maintain stable levels of passive and active tensions. The
addition of the NO-releasing drug, C87-3754, prevented su￾peroxide anion formation, programmed cell death, and the
alterations in active and passive tensions with time of over￾loaded papillary muscles. In conclusion, overstretching ap￾pears to be coupled with oxidant stress, expression of Fas,
programmed cell death, architectural rearrangement of
myocytes, and impairment in force development of the myo￾cardium. (J. Clin. Invest. 1995. 96:2247-2259.) Key words:

Introduction
Recently, the possibility has been advanced that mechanical
forces produced by pathologic hemodynamic loads may lead to
myocyte cell death in the myocardium (1). This hypothesis has
been made in an attempt to understand the changes in cardiac
anatomy after coronary artery constriction and global myocar￾dial ischemia, and coronary artery occlusion and myocardial
infarction (1, 2). However, no documentation of this phenome￾non has been obtained. This is a relevant issue because acute
reductions in wall thickness and chamber dilation, as a conse￾quence of sudden increases in ventricular end-diastolic pressure,
may involve mural translocation of cells, a phenomenon com￾monly described as side-to-side slippage of myocytes (2). With
this form of wall restructuring, the rings of cells that move

radially towards the epicardial region must expand to enclose
a larger cavitary volume. Since lengthening of sarcomeres and
elongation of myocytes alone are inadequate to explain the
increase in dimension of the ventricle (2-4), single myocyte
cell death has been postulated to occur to allow side by side
translocation of cells within the wall. In the absence of multiple
cell death, the sliding of myocyte bundles from the inner to the
outer layer of the wall would not take place, limiting mural
thinning and chamber dilation. Importantly, single myocyte cell
death has been claimed to be mediated by mechanical forces
within the wall which may activate genes involved in apoptotic
cell death (5). Therefore, experiments were conducted in an in
vitro system in which abnormal resting tension levels were
imposed on muscles obtained from normal adult rat hearts. The
possibility was raised that the physical forces may induce apop￾totic cell death in these muscles by enhancing the production
of reactive oxygen species (6). Overstretching may also in￾crease the expression of the cell surface molecule, Fas (7, 8),
which has been found to be involved in apoptotic myocyte cell
death (9). Since nitric oxide (NO) has been shown to decrease
programmed cell death in other cell types (10) and to react
with superoxide anion (11) and perhaps reduce oxidant stress
(12), the beneficial effects of an NO-releasing drug (13) were
examined in this setting.
Methods
Muscle mechanics. Male Sprague-Dawley rats at 3 mo of age were
anesthetized with ether. Hearts were rapidly excised and placed in oxy￾genated Thyrode solution containing potassium to induce diastolic arrest.
In each experiment, two left posterior papillary muscles were obtained
from two animals and suspended side-by-side in a muscle bath. The
nontendinous end of each papillary muscle was mounted to a micrometer
assembly used to adjust external muscle length. The tendinous end of
the papillary muscle was tied to a steel wire with Ethicon 5-0 braided
silk (Ethicon, Inc., Somerville, NJ). The wire was attached to a 2-
cm stainless lever connected to a servo-controlled galvanometer for
measurement of isometric contraction. Muscles were perfused continu￾ously with normal Thyrode solution maintained at 300C by using a
coiled glass heat exchanger at the inflow line in conjunction with a
circulating water bath. The solution was gassed with 95% 02/5% CO2
(pH = 7.2). Preparations were stimulated at 0.1 Hz by rectangular
depolarizing pulses 10 ms in duration and twice diastolic threshold in
intensity (14).
After an equilibration period of 60-90 min, during which the mus￾cles contracted isometrically at a resting tension of 9.8 mN/mm2, the
passive and active stress-strain relations were determined. In one group
of muscles (n = 12), resting muscle length was increased step-wise
until a maximal active tension was developed (L.,.).' Resting length
was then changed three times between L.,, and 85% of L,,. to assess
reproductibility of the curve. In the other group of muscles (n = 14),
a similar procedure was followed but initial muscle length was taken
beyond Lma,, until passive and active stress-strain relations were estab￾1. Abbreviation used in this paper: L,,., maximal active tension.

lished between 106 and 85% of Lmax. Step changes in length were
made in a reproducible sequence to minimize the effects of hysteresis.
Parameters dependent on muscle length were computed at intervals of
2% Lma, by linear interpolation of the data. At the completion of each
experiment, muscle length was measured with a reticle in the eyepiece
of a dissecting microscope set at a magnification of 30. Muscle diameter
was computed by averaging five equally spaced microscopic measure￾ments throughout the length of the papillary muscle. The cross-sectional
area was then calculated assuming the geometry of a circular cylinder.
This latter parameter was also confirmed by dividing muscle weight by
its length assuming a tissue density of 1.065 grams/cm3 (14).
Histologic detection of DNA strand breaks. For this portion of the
study, nine left posterior papillary muscles which had not been stretched
beyond Lm., were positioned in the muscle bath at a fixed resting
tension of nearly 7-8 mN/mm2. A second group of 10 left papillary
muscles, which had been overstretched beyond Lm., were maintained
at a resting tension of - 50 mN/mm2. These interventions were kept
for a 3-h period during which muscles were stimulated as described
above. At the completion of these mechanical impositions, papillary
muscles were fixed for 24 h in phosphate buffered 4% formalin. Tissue
was then embedded in paraffin. Sections, - 4 um in thickness, were
obtained from each papillary muscle and mounted on poly-L-lysine￾coated slides (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO). After deparaffini￾zation and rehydration, tissue sections were incubated in PBS, containing
0.1% saponin and 1 mM EGTA for 30 min (5). Subsequently, sections
were covered with 50 /l of staining solution containing 5 U of terminal
deoxynucleotidyl transferase, 2.5 mM CoCl2, 0.2 M potassium cacodyl￾ate, 25 mM Tris-HCl, 0.25% bovine serum albumin and 0.5 nM 2'-
deoxyuridine-5'-triphosphate, coupled to biotin via a 16-atom spacer
arm (biotin- 16-dUTP). These reagents were all from Boehringer Mann￾heim Biochemicals (Indianapolis, IN). Sections were incubated in this
solution for 30 min at 370C in a humidified chamber. After rinsing in
PBS, sections were incubated for 30 min at room temperature in a
solution containing 4X concentrated SSC buffered and 5% (wt/vol)
nonfat dry milk (Sigma Chemical Co.). Finally, the staining solution
which contained 5 jg/ml of HITC-labeled Extravidin (Sigma Chemical
Co.), 4X concentrated SSC buffer, 0.1% Triton X-100 and 5% nonfat
dry milk was applied for 30 min.
Positive and negative controls were included in the protocol to con￾firm the specificity of the assay. As a positive control, myocardial sec￾tions were treated with DNase I to induce enzymatically the formation
of DNA strand breaks. The tissue was treated with this enzyme for 15
min at 37°C and, after washing with PBS, the terminal deoxynucleotidyl
transferase assay was performed. Negative controls consisted of staining
for DNA strand breaks sections similarly treated in which biotin-16-
dUTP or terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase was not present. After
terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase reaction, the sections were rinsed
in PBS, and stained for a-sarcomeric actin. The tissue was incubated
first at 37°C for 30 min with the primary antibody (clone SC5; Sigma
Chemical Co.) diluted 1:20 in PBS, containing 10% goat serum, and
subsequently with anti-mouse IgG tetramethylrhodamine B isothiocya￾nate (TRITC) -labeled antibody (Sigma Chemical Co.), also diluted
1:30 in PBS, containing 10% goat serum. Sections were then stained
with bisbenzimide, 50 ng/ml, for 15 min to visualize nuclei. After this
procedure, sections were rinsed in PBS and embedded in Vectashield
(Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) mounting medium.
Quantitative analysis of DNA strand breaks in myocytes and non￾myocytes. The number of myocyte nuclei in the papillary muscles la￾beled by biotinylated dUTP was measured by counting the number of
stained nuclei per unit area of tissue sections in each papillary muscle.
This analysis was performed with a microscope working in epifluores￾cence mode, equipped with sets of excitation emission filters for FITC
(excitation blue, emission green), which allowed the identification of
incorporated dUTP in nuclei. The number of labeled nuclei was recorded
and the distinction between myocytes and nonmyocytes was obtained
by detection of a-sarcomeric actin with the use of a second set of filters
specific for TRITC (excitation green, emission red). By this approach,
the number of myocytes and nonmyocytes stained by dUTP per mm2
of tissue was determined in each muscle. Sections were examined at a
magnification of 1,250 by viewing subsequent fields through the entire
papillary muscle. A square tissue area equal to 6,084 nm2 was delineated
in the microscopic field by an ocular reticle (#105844; Wild Heerbrugg
Instruments, Inc., Farmingdale, NY) and an average of 800 fields in
each muscle were examined.
Morphometric determination of the number of dUTP-labeled myo￾cytes and nonmyocytes. The histologic preparation described in the pre￾ceding section did not permit the determination of the fraction of myo￾cyte nuclei labeled by dUTP. To obtain this parameter the number of
myocyte nuclei and nonmyocyte nuclei per unit area of tissue was
determined by counting an average of 30 fields, 6,084 Atm2 each, at a
magnification of 1,250 in each papillary muscle. This analysis was
performed with a microscope working in epifluorescence mode,
equipped with sets of excitation emission filters for bisbenzimide
H33258 (excitation UV, emission blue) and TRITC (excitation green,
emission red). In randomly selected fields, nuclei were identified first
(bisbenzimide staining), then excitation emission filters were changed
to visualize myocytes labeled with anti- a-sarcomeric actin. In this
manner, the numerical density of myocyte and nonmyocyte nuclei in
each papillary muscle was obtained. By combining these data with the
preceding estimations of dUTP-labeled myocyte and nonmyocyte nuclei
per unit area of myocardium, the number of apoptotic myocyte and
nonmyocyte nuclei per 106 nuclei was determined.
DNA gel electrophoresis. To confirm that the histochemical detec￾tion of DNA strand breaks corresponded to internucleosomal cleavage,
the presence of low molecular weight DNA in papillary muscles was
determined ( 15). Groups of three papillary muscles each were mechani￾cally homogenized on ice and fixed for 24 h at -20'C in 70% ethanol.
The tissue was then centrifuged at 800 g for 5 min and the ethanol was
thoroughly removed. The pellet was resuspended in 40 ,ul of phosphate￾citrate buffer, consisting of 192 parts of 0.2 M Na2HPO4 and 8 parts of
0.1 M citric acid (pH 7.8), at room temperature, for 1 h. After centrifu￾gation at 1,000 g for 5 min, the supernatant was transferred to new
tubes and concentrated by vacuum in a SpeedVac concentrator (Savant
Instruments Inc., Farmingdale, NY) for 15 min. A 3-Al aliquot of 0.25%
NP-40 (Sigma Chemical Co.) in distilled water was then added, fol￾lowed by 3 /l of a solution of RNase, 1 mg/ml, also in water. After
30-min incubation at 37°C, 3 IL of a solution of proteinase K, 1 mg/
ml (Boehringer Mannheim Biochemicals), was added and the extract
was incubated for an additional 1 h at 37°C. After the incubation, 12
Al of loading buffer, 0.25% bromophenol blue, 30% glycerol, was added
and samples were subjected to electrophoresis on 1% agarose gel con￾taining 5 Ag/ml ethidium bromide. The DNA in the gels was visualized
under UV light. For this portion of the study, six nonoverstretched
muscles and six overstretched muscles were utilized.
Immunohistochemical localization of Fas. Tissue sections mounted
on poly-L-lysine-coated glass slides were deparaffinized by heating at
90°C followed by three washes in xylene. After dehydration in absolute
ethanol for 15 s, slides were incubated in 2% (vol/vol) H202 in methanol
for 30-45 s then washed with 95% ethanol for 20 s, followed sequen￾tially by 70% ethanol for 20 s, distilled H20 for 1 min, and PBS (120
mmol/liter NaCl, 11.5 mmol/liter NaH2PO4, 31.3 mmol/liter KH2PO4,
pH 7.4-7.6) for 5 min and then heated by microwaving for 15 min.
After washing twice in PBS for 5 min, tissue sections were preblocked
for 45 min in TNK solution (100 mmol/liter Tris, pH 7.6-7.8, 550
mmol/liter NaCl, 10 mmol/liter KCl) containing 2% (wt/vol) BSA
(Sigma Chemical Co.) 0.1% Triton X-100, and 1% normal goat serum.
Antibodies were added to the slide in the same solution and incubated
overnight at room temperature. Anti-mouse Fas hamster monoclonal
antibody (clone Jo2; Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) was used at 1:100
(vol/vol) dilution. In some cases, the primary antibodies were omitted
(negative controls). Myeloma IgG antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch
Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA) was also used as a second form
of negative control. After washing with PBS, tissue sections were incu￾bated for 1 h with 5 Ag/ml of biotinylated goat anti-rabbit antibody
(Vector Laboratories, Inc.) for the detection of Fas and then washed
and incubated for 30-45 min with an avidin-biotin complex reagent
containing horseradish peroxidase (Vector Laboratories, Inc.) in TNK.
Color development was achieved by incubation for 10 minutes with a

solution containing 3,3'-diaminobenzidine (DAB) and 0.1% (vol/vol)
H202 in TNK buffer.
The quantitative analysis of the cell localization of Fas protein was
performed in 4 and 5 papillary muscles exposed to low and high levels
of tension, respectively. Five equally spaced areas, along the longitudi￾nal axis of each muscle, were samples and the number of labeled and
unlabeled myocytes across the diameter of the muscle was determined
in each region. These individual values were then averaged to yield a
mean value in each muscle.
Detection of superoxide anion. Papillary muscle were exposed to
levels of tension comparable to those described above. Under these
conditions, the formation of superoxide anion was examined over a
period of 3 h during which loading was kept constant. At the end of
this procedure, muscles were fixed in 4% phosphate buffered formalin
and embedded in paraffin for the subsequent detection of programmed
cell death. Specifically, changes in force and 0- generation were deter￾mined in a single photon counting apparatus constructed in a light tight
box. In these experiments, stimulated muscles were incubated in Krebs'
bicarbonate buffer containing 0.25 mM lucigenin in a continuously
gassed 1 cm2 spectrophotometer cuvette mounted in a thermostated cell
holder on the surface of a Lucite light guide (with a shutter cover)
directed into a cooled Thorn EMI Photomultiplier Tube (model 9235B;
Thorn EMI Electron Tubes , Ruslip, United Kingdom). A Thorn EMI
amplifier-discriminator (model C604) and photon counter (model
C660) were used to quantitate chemiluminescence. The counts were
integrated over 5-s periods by the photon counter, and an analog signal
of the integrated counts was continuously recorded on a (model 7 Poly￾graph; Grass Instrument Co., Quincy, MA) recorder together with
changes in force (16). This analysis was conducted in four and five
muscles at low and high tension levels, respectively. The effects of
superoxide dismutase on the generation of superoxide anion in over￾stretched muscles were also examined (n = 4). Moreover, the ability
of N-2-mercaptopropionyl glycine to inhibit superoxide anion intracellu￾lary was evaluated in four overstretched papillary muscles. For these
two conditions, muscles were exposed to either superoxide dismutase,
3 jiM, or N-2-mercaptopropionyl glycine, 2 mM, for 15 min (17, 18)
before the determination of chemiluminescence levels (16). The dose
of N-2-mercaptopropionyl glycine used here was established on the basis
of preliminary experiments showing that the ability of this compound to
affect superoxide anion was maximal at 2 mM without significant in￾creases up to 20 mM.
Effects of CAS 936. The potential beneficial influence of the NO￾releasing drug C87-3754, a metabolite of CAS 936 (13), on the genera￾tion of superoxide anion and the activation of programmed cell death
was examined in papillary muscles. This was performed by superfusing
muscles kept at low and high tension levels (see above), with a solution
containing 10 ktM C87-3754 during a 3-h period. The formation of
reactive oxygen species was measured throughout and after the histo￾logic preparation described above, Fas and dUTP labeling of the tissue
was determined. Five muscles of high tension levels were used for
chemiluminescence measurements, and seven were used for evaluation
of DNA strand breaks. The effects of C87-3754 on developed and
resting tensions with time were evaluated in 10 papillary muscles and
compared with an identical number of muscles not exposed to the drug.
Number of myocytes across the muscle. Papillary muscles exposed
to low and high levels of resting tension for a 3-h period were fixed in
these conditions with a solution containing 5% glutaraldehyde and 4%
paraformaldehyde. Papillary muscles were then removed and sliced
transversely into four pieces which were embedded in araldite. One
fragment of tissue was embedded longitudinally for the measurement
of sarcomere length. Semithin sections, - 0.5 Hm in thickness, were
cut from each block perpendicular to the long axis of the muscle and
showing its whole cross-sectional area. The transverse area was deter￾mined by an interacting tracking device and the mean diameter was
computed (Jandel Scientific, Corte Madera, CA). Subsequently, thin
sections were obtained from these blocks and low power electron micro￾graphs, four from each of two blocks from each papillary muscle, were
collected. These micrographs were printed at a final magnification of
4,500 and the volume composition of the myocardium and the numerical
density of myocyte profiles per unit area of tissue were measured as
previously described (2). The availability of papillary muscle diameter
and myocyte density allowed the calculation of the number of cells
across the papillary muscle (2). The mean center-to-center distance
(d,-c) between myocytes was calculated from the number of profiles
counted per unit area of tissue, (N(m)A) in transverse myocardial sections
by assuming the tendency for these roughly cylindrical cells to pack in
a close hexagonal pattern (2):
2 -1.0746
VN(m)A IN'.7A
In a hexagonal pattern, the spacing between planes of adjacent cells
varies with the orientation of the array from a maximum of d.-c to a
minimum of dr-, 6V/2 and has a mean value, d, representative of random
orientation, given by
3dc- 63 Ir/6 dO d-C =~~v~ 6d = 0.9085 d￾ir O cosO
Thus, the number, N(m)t,,,, of myocytes across the thickness of the papil￾lary muscle, W, can be found from
N(m)tin = W/d = 1.0243.W/ii(.)A
This analysis was performed in six muscles at low and six muscles at
high tension levels. The block of tissue embedded parallel to the major
axis of the papillary muscle was sectioned and sarcomere length in
myofibrils was determined in each muscle from 100 measurements made
at a magnification of 30,000. These sections were longitudinally oriented
and were cut perpendicular to their length to avoid longitudinal compres￾sion.
Data collection and analysis. All tissue samples were coded, and
the code was broken at the end of the experiment. Results are presented
as meantSD computed from the average measurements obtained from
each muscle. Comparisons between two values were performed using
a two-tailed Student's t test. Statistical significance in multiple compari￾sons in which the analysis of variance and the F test indicated the
presence of significant differences was determined by the Bonferonni
method. Values of P < 0.05 were considered significant.
Results
Muscle mechanics. Fig. 1 illustrates the passive and active
length tension relationships of papillary muscles between 85
and 100% of L,,,, and between 85 and 106% of L,,o. Muscles
stretched up to 100% of L,,, showed that the progressive in￾crease in resting tension was coupled with a parallel increase
in developed tension which peaked at L., (Fig. 1 A). These
muscles maintained their ability to generate expected levels of
developed tension upward and downward along the entire length
tension curve. In contrast, papillary muscles stretched beyond
L,,, exhibited marked increases in resting tension associated
with a decrease in isometric developed tension (Fig. 1 B). From
100 to 106% of L.,,, resting tension increased from a value of
19 mN/mm2 to a value of 52 mN/mm2. In contrast, isometric
developed tension decreased from a value of 73 mN/mm2 to a
value of 61 mN/mm2. These differences were both statistically
significant (P < 0.001). Moreover, overstretched papillary
muscles were unable to produce the same developed tensions
and when moved downward along the length, tension relation￾ships produced less tensions throughout the range of physiologic
loads examined. The resting tension curve was shifted to the
right at all lengths from 104 to 94% of Lmal (P < 0.001),
whereas the reductions in developed tension were statistically
significant from 102 to 85% of L, (P < 0.001).

developed tensions in papillary muscles exposed to resting ten￾sion levels of - 7-8 and 50 mN/mm2, respectively. Moderately
stretched papillary muscles maintained comparable levels of
passive and active tensions over a 3-h period. Conversely, over￾stretched muscles showed an initial increase in isometric devel￾oped tension followed by a progressive decline with time. Rest￾ing tension in these muscles decreased continuously during the
3-h interval. In summary, overstretching affected the ability
of papillary muscles to maintain stable levels of resting and
developed isometric tensions with time.
Structural characteristics. Semithin sections of papillary
muscles showed that the normal structure of muscles was pre￾served in all cases. Thus, consistent with previous results ( 19),
the size of the muscles used in this study did not limit oxygen￾ation of the core of the muscles producing cellular damage.
This was confirmed quantitatively, since the volume fraction of
myocytes and interstitial compartment in muscles exposed to
moderate levels of tension was 86±1.0 and 14 1.0, whereas
the corresponding values in muscles kept at high tension were
87±2.0 and 13+±2.0. Measurements of papillary muscle cross￾sectional area were obtained from these histologic preparations
for the subsequent evaluation of papillary muscle diameter.
High resting tension levels were associated with an 8% reduc￾tion in muscle diameter which, however, was not statistically
significant (Fig. 3 A).
The numerical density of myocyte profiles per unit area of
papillary muscle was obtained by low power electron micros￾copy. Myocyte numerical density was 5,405+344 in muscles
maintained for 3 h at 7-8 mN/mm2 and 4,857±444 in muscles
kept for the same time at 50 mN/mm2. These values, in combi￾nation with the volume fraction of myocytes in the tissue, were
utilized to compute the average cross-sectional area and diame￾ter of myocytes. In comparison with muscles subjected to mod￾erate loads, high loads were characterized by a 13 and 6%

However, these changes were not statistically significant (Fig.
3 B). On the other hand, sarcomere length measured in longitu￾dinally oriented sections of myocytes was 7% shorter in over￾loaded muscle (Fig. 3 C) and this difference was statistically
significant (P < 0.01). When the number of myocytes across
the diameter of the papillary muscle was computed according
to the equation in the Methods section, muscles maintained at
50 mN/mm2 were found to possess 15% less myocyte profiles
than muscles kept at 7-8 mN/mm2 (Fig. 3 D). This difference
was statistically significant (P < 0.02). In summary, high ten￾sion levels reduced the number of myocyte profiles within the

specificity of the technique utilized to stain DNA strand breaks
in different cell populations was documented by treating tissue
sections with DNase I before the detection of DNA strand
breaks by dUTP labeling (Fig. 4, A and B). Conversely, DNA
strand breaks were not detected when biotin-16-dUTP (Fig. 4,
C and D) or terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase was not
included in the enzymatic reaction. An identical effect was also
obtained by staining sections which contained DNA strand
breaks in the absence of biotin-16-dUTP or terminal deoxy￾nucleotidyl transferase.
Fig. 5 illustrates the localization of DNA strand breaks in
myocyte nuclei of left posterior papillary muscles maintained
for 3 h at 50 mN/mm2. Occasional dUTP-stained myocyte nu￾clei were also seen in muscles kept at 7-8 mN/mm2. However,
the number of positively labeled myocyte nuclei was greater in
muscles exposed to higher tension levels. Interstitial cells were
also found to be labeled by dUTP and the number of apoptotic
nonmyocyte nuclei also increased in overstretched muscle prep￾arations. In contrast, after treatment with C87-3754, dUTP la￾beling of myocytes and nonmyocytes in muscles maintained at
50 mN/mm2 was significantly reduced, reaching values similar
to those of muscles kept at 7-8 mN/mm2. To avoid potential
influences from the damaged ends of the muscle, this analysis
was restricted to the mid-portion of each papillary muscle.
Fig. 6 shows quantitatively the effects of overstretching and
C87-3754 on the number of myocyte nuclei and nonmyocyte
nuclei exhibiting DNA strand breaks in papillary muscles. After
a 3-h period of exposure of muscles to high tension levels,
6,400 myocyte nuclei per 106 nuclei exhibited DNA strand
breaks. This value was 21-fold higher than that obtained in
muscles kept at moderate tension, 300 myocyte nuclei per 106
nuclei. This difference was statistically significant (P < 0.001).
In addition, overstretching was associated with a 2.4-fold in￾crease in the number of interstitial cells labeled by dUTP. This
difference was also statistically significant (P < 0.02). Con￾versely, C87-3754 was capable of maintaining the extent of
dUTP labeling of myocytes and nonmyocytes within values
comparable to those found at moderate tension, in spite of the
overstretching. In summary, overstretching was associated with
a 21-fold and a 2.4-fold increase in the magnitude of dUTP
labeling of myocytes and nonmyocytes in papillary muscles and
C87-3754 prevented this phenomenon.
Detection of DNA laddering in the myocardium. The pres￾ence of DNA fragments of size equivalent to the mono or oligo￾nucleosomes was determined to confirm the detection of DNA
strand breaks in myocyte nuclei. Because only a relative small
fraction of myocytes was undergoing apoptosis in the over￾stretched papillary muscles, a procedure for extraction of low

molecular weight DNA from apoptotic cells was used (15). As
illustrated in Fig. 7, extracts obtained from the muscles exposed
to 50 mNN/mm2 revealed the presence of DNA fragments consis￾tent with apoptosis. Stretches of DNA of size equivalent to 200
bp were the most abundant. Moreover, 400-, 600-, and 800-bp
fragments which correspond to two, three, and four nucleo￾somes, respectively, were also visible. In contrast, no degrada￾tion of DNA was found in nonoverstretched papillary muscles.
In summary, DNA fragmentation characteristic of apoptotic cell
death was observed in overstretched papillary muscles.
Chemiluminescent measurement of superoxide anion gener￾ation. To determine whether overstretching of the papillary
muscle was associated with an enhanced formation of reactive
oxygen species, lucigenin-dependent photoemission was mea￾sured in muscles kept for 3 h at 7-8 and 50 mN/mm2. As
illustrated in Fig. 8, papillary muscles exposed to the lower
level of tension exhibited no changes in the formation of super￾oxide anion during the 3-h period of stretching. In contrast,
overstretching resulted in a marked elevation of superoxide￾elicited lucigenin chemiluminescence. When these two values
were compared, a 2.7-fold higher activation of superoxide for￾mation was found in muscles at 50 mN/mm2 (P < 0.005) than
in muscles at 7-8 mN/mm2. To establish whether NO was able
to prevent stretch-induced superoxide generation, a separate
group of overstretched papillary muscles was exposed to 10
,tM C87-3754. As shown in Fig. 8, in the presence of the NO￾releasing drug, a 42% (P < 0.02) decrease in the formation of
superoxide anion was noted. To confirm the intracellular origin
of superoxide anion, the effects of superoxide dismutase and
N-2-mercaptopropionyl glycine on overstretched muscles were
measured. Superoxide dismutase did not affect the level of
chemiluminescence generated by the overstretched muscles.
This intervention decreased the formation of superoxide anion
by 2.65±4.51% (n = 4) which was not statistically significant.
In contrast, N-2-mercaptopropionyl glycine reduced this param￾eter by 53.51 + 11.64% (n = 4) and this change was statistically
significant (P < 0.01).
Fig. 9 illustrates the values of active and resting tensions of
papillary muscles exposed to a load of - 50 mN/mm2, in the
presence and absence of C87-3754. This phenomenon was ex￾amined over a 3-h period. The NO-releasing drug was associ￾ated with lower levels of developed tension than those observed
in the absence of C87-3754, in spite of a comparable magnitude
of preload. Resting tension was similar in both groups of mus￾cles. Moreover, developed and resting tension decreased with
time in the absence of the drug intervention, whereas no statisti￾2252 Cheng et al.

nostaining for Fas was only occasionally observed in myocytes
of muscles maintained at 7-8 mN/mm2 (Fig. 10 A), numerous
myocytes were labeled in muscles kept at 50 mN/mm2 (Fig.
10, B and C). In contrast, Fas labeling was not detected in
interstitial cells of the same muscles. The specificity of immuno￾staining for Fas was confirmed by the lack of labeling when
sections were processed in the absence of the primary antibody
(Fig. 10 D) or in the presence of myeloma IgG antibody (Fig.
10 E). It should be emphasized that tissue sections could not be
stained simultaneously for DNA strand breaks and Fas protein
because dUTP labeling required 0.2 M cacodylate buffer which
interferes with Fas immunolabeling. Conversely, retrieval of
Fas antigen requires microwaving which induces DNA strand
breaks (not illustrated). However, attempts were made to docu￾ment Fas labeling and dUTP staining in serial sections of the
same muscle. By this approach, it was possible to observe that,
at times, Fas overexpression and DNA strand breaks involved
the same muscle cell profiles (Fig. 10, F-I). Quantitatively,
the number of myocytes labeled by Fas was 67,000±26,000
per 106 cells in overstretched muscles and 3,200±2,400 per 106
cells in nonoverstretched muscles. This difference was statisti￾cally significant (P < 0.003). Importantly, C87-3754 treatment
reduced the number of Fas-labeled myocytes in overstretched
muscle to 7,800±2,300 per 106 cells. The 88% decrease in Fas
labeling of myocytes was statistically significant (P < 0.01).
The addition of C87-3754 resulted in a level of Fas labeling in
overstretched muscles similar to that measured in nonover￾stretched muscles (P = 0.1). In summary, overstretching was
associated with an increase in the expression of Fas in myocytes
which was markedly attenuated by an NO donor.
Discussion
The results of the current study indicate that the force generating
ability of papillary muscles exposed to high levels of resting
tension decreased along the entire length tension relationship.
Anatomically, this phenomenon was characterized by a decrease

in muscle diameter, apoptotic myocyte and nonmyocyte cell
death, and a reduction in the number of muscle cells within
the thickness of the papillary muscle. Moreover, endogenous
superoxide production was increased. At the molecular level,
an enhanced expression of Fas receptor protein was documented
in myocytes. Thus, the possibility may be raised that pathologic
alterations of myocardial load may be coupled with the genera￾tion of reactive oxygen species and the activation of gene prod￾ucts implicated in programmed cell death. In turn, this phenom￾enon may lead to an architectural rearrangement of the myocar￾dium involving side-to-side slippage of myocytes. Importantly,
interventions resulting in the release of NO prevented the forma￾tion of superoxide anion, Fas protein, programmed cell death
and the relative reduction in muscle performance associated
with the imposition of abnormal mechanical loads.
Mechanical performance of the myocardium. Along the as￾cending limb of the cardiac length-tension curve, developed
tension is length dependent and this property is related to the
calcium activation of myofilaments mediated by the troponin￾tropomyosin protein regulatory complex (20, 21). The overlap￾ping of thin and thick filaments is unchanged in the positive
portion of the Frank-Starling relation (22), and the changes
in resting length and force development are related to the extent
of calcium myofilament interaction (22, 23). However, less
understood are the mechanisms implicated in the alterations in
resting and active tensions observed in muscles exposed to lev￾els of stretch beyond the peak of the length-tension curve (22).
Under this setting, excessive passive forces are generated and
damage has been claimed to occur to the ends of the muscle
preparations affecting tension development (22). Misalignment
of sarcomeres and/or slippage of myofibrils within the cells
have been considered to represent the in vivo counterpart of
these in vitro conditions mimicking pathologic states of the
heart (24).
Observations in the current study document that high loads
altered the contractile behavior of the myocardium and this
phenomenon was characterized by a reduction in muscle diame￾ter. Importantly, sarcomere length was longer in muscles fixed
at moderate than high loads. Damage to the myocyte and
nonmyocyte compartments of the muscle was not observed in
either case. In addition, the lack of register between individual
myofibrils in the cytoplasm was a consistent finding in both
preparations, raising questions on the role played by this struc￾tural modification in the depression of force generation in over￾stretched papillary muscles. The decrease of sarcomere length
in muscles kept for a 3-h period at 50 mN/mm2 suggests that
the mechanical imposition shifted the muscle downward on the
length tension relationship resulting in a decrease in tension
development. This notion is consistent with a slight reduction
in sarcomere length at higher loads.
Ventricular dilation after increases in filling pressure in the
intact heart in vitro, acute and chronic ventricular dysfunction,
acute and chronic myocardial infarction, sudden restrictions in
coronary perfusion with global myocardial ischemia, and during
the alterations in loading associated with the transition from the
fetal to the adult circulatory system (for review see reference
25) has all been considered to be characterized by a structural
reorganization of the myocyte compartment of the myocardium,
resulting in mural thinning and expansion in cavitary volume.
This adaptation, consisting of side-to-side slippage of cells
within the wall, appears to be the principal determinant of acute
ventricular dilation under these pathologic conditions of the
heart. In a few cases, a decrease in the number of myocytes
included in the thickness of the ventricular wall has been dem￾onstrated quantitatively (2, 26) in an attempt to support the
notion of mural translocation of cells. Findings in the current
study demonstrate that abnormal mechanical forces resulted in
a reduction in the number of cells within the width of the
papillary muscle, providing the first documentation that load
and myocyte slippage are causally related.
Programmed myocyte cell death. Although very little is
known concerning programmed cell death in the myocardium
(5, 27), this phenomenon affects various cell types and is initi￾ated by a variety of environmental stimuli (28). During this
process, an important factor is the activation of an endogenous
endonuclease which results in endonucleolysis (28). DNA deg￾radation, triggered by this mechanism, is specific to the spacer
regions, leaving the DNA associated with the nucleosomes in￾tact (29). The technique used here allowed an early detection
of DNA strand breaks in myocardial cell nuclei by the terminal
deoxynucleotydil transferase assay (28). Moreover, the mor￾phologic documentation of apoptotic cell death was confirmed
by the demonstration of intranucleosomal cleavage by the DNA
laddering assay. Similar observations have been made after isch￾emic reperfusion injury of the rabbit heart in vivo (27), and in
neonatal cardiac myocytes in culture exposed to hypoxic condi￾tion (9). However, defects in oxygen diffusion to the papillary
muscle in our preparation were unlikely, suggesting that pro￾Load Dependent-induced Apoptosis 2255

grammed cell death occurred via a different mechanism. Isch￾emic myocyte cell death is characterized by rupture of the sarco￾lemmal lining, contraction bands in myofibrils, and mitochon￾drial swelling (28-30). Loss of membrane function (28) and
mitochondrial swelling are distinct aspects of necrotic cell death
in all cell populations (28, 30). In contrast, programmed cell
death typically occurs in the absence of loss of plasma mem￾brane integrity and function (28-30). The morphology of mito￾chondria in apoptotic cells is also unchanged. Findings in this
study, documenting the lack of alterations at the level of the
2256 Cheng et al.

Figure 10 (Continued)
plasma membrane, myofibrils and mitochondria, indicate that
the protocols used did not produce necrotic cell death in the
papillary muscles. In addition, apoptotic cell death appeared
to be independent from local ischemia. DNA strand breaks in
myocyte and nonmyocyte nuclei were detected in the absence
of structural abnormalities at the light and electron microscopic
levels, suggesting that 3 h of mechanical stretching produced
lesions characteristic of the early phases of apoptotic cell death.
The observation that overstretching triggered programmed
cell death, involving nearly 0.5% of myocytes, raises the possi￾bility that loss of contractile function in these apoptotic cells
may have influenced the detrimental impact of high loading
states on isometric tension development of the myocardium.
Although the percentage of cells affected by this phenomenon
was less than the reduction in active tension, single cell death
may have impinged upon the force generating ability of neigh￾boring cells depressing more severely overall muscle perfor￾mance. DNA laddering clearly showed the presence of 200-,
400-, 600-, and 800-bp fragments of DNA in the overstretched
muscles, but the actual magnitude of programmed cell death in
Load Dependent-induced Apoptosis 2257

the tissue cannot be calculated from these observations. Simi￾larly, dUTP labeling of myocytes provides an estimation of the
early events of apoptosis only (28). Thus, the percentage of
myocytes labeled by dUTP most likely represents an underesti￾mation of the real extent of myocyte cell death in the tissue
(5). As indicated above, myocyte slippage was accompanied
by a decrease in sarcomere length, modifying the passive and
active length tension relationships. However, the relative contri￾bution of programmed myocyte cell death and myocyte slippage
to the impairment in myocardial performance in overstretched
papillary muscles cannot be determined at present. On the other
hand, these events characterize a common pathophysiologic
phenomenon in which abnormal loads trigger programmed
myocyte cell death which leads to side-to-side slippage of myo￾cytes depressing muscle contractile behavior.
The magnitude of apoptotic myocyte death in overstretched
muscle was lower than the extent of myocytes expressing Fas
protein on the surface of the cell and cytoplasm. Fas protein was
barely detectable in myocytes of moderately loaded muscles,
indicating that its expression was dependent upon the extent of
load imposed on the myocardium. Although a cause and effect
relationship between programmed myocyte cell death and the
Fas molecule cannot be claimed, it is noteworthy that Fas
mRNA increases in neonatal cardiac myocytes in culture under￾going programmed cell death (9). The Fas gene belongs to the
tumor necrosis factor and nerve growth factor receptor family
(7-9) and apoptosis can be triggered by ligand activation of
the Fas receptor (8). Whether stressed myocytes can generate
the Fas ligand triggering their own suicide program is currently
unknown. Although the lack of Fas labeling in fibroblasts of
overstretched muscles was unexpected, this phenomenon ap￾pears to be consistent with the moderate increase in apoptotic
cell death of the interstitial cell population of the myocardium
under this setting.
Reactive oxygen species, NO, and programmed cell death.
Impositions of high loads on the myocardium are characterized
by an increased oxygen consumption and this phenomenon may
lead to the generation of superoxide anion which may activate
the suicide program of myocytes and interstitial cells (6). NO
may counteract superoxide exerting a protective influence
against apoptotic cell death in vitro (10). The results of the
current study are consistent with this contention, since the NO￾releasing drug, C87-3754, was capable of preventing the forma￾tion of DNA strand breaks in myocytes and interstitial cells of
papillary muscles exposed to high levels of tension. In addition,
the preservation of myocardial structural integrity was associ￾ated with the maintenance of resting and active tension values
of overstretched muscles with time. Thus, NO salvaged the
myocardium from the detrimental impact of overstretching,
functionally and morphologically.
Although it is difficult to recognize, at present, the effector
pathway that couples abnormal mechanical loads, enhanced ex￾pression of Fas, programmed cell death and muscle restructur￾ing, the observations with NO release point to the induction of
superoxide as a relevant factor in the initiation of this cascade of
events. Several cellular mechanisms can form reactive oxygen
species, including the conversion of xanthine dehydrogenase to
xanthine oxidase in reperfusion injury (31), mixed-function
oxidase systems (32), and electron transport in the respiratory
chain (33). Whether one or multiple cellular processes contrib￾uted to myocardial injury in the overstretched papillary muscle
remains to be determined. NO may alleviate oxidant stress and
thereby protect from apoptosis (34, 35). However, NO adminis￾tration markedly reduced the extent of tension development in
the overloaded papillary muscle, and this negative inotropic
effect may have contributed to diminish the damaging impact
of a load of 50 mN/mm2 on the structure and function of myo￾cytes. This reduction in muscle performance is consistent with
observation in vivo (36-38) and in vitro (39, 40), indicating
that NO reduces oxygen consumption and decreases myocardial
contractility.
In conclusion, abnormal levels of resting tension appeared
to be associated with the activation of the suicide program of
myocytes and reduction in muscle mechanical performance. In
addition, an architectural rearrangement of the myocyte com￾partment occurred, and this phenomenon of restructuring, in
combination with apoptotic cell death, may have contributed
to depress the mechanical behavior of the myocardium. The
intracellular formation of superoxide anion and the overex￾pression of Fas protein in myocytes may have been the critical
factors in the initiation of the cascade of events leading to
programmed cell death and alteration in myocardial contractil￾ity. NO seemed to protect from these detrimental effects of
overstretching.
