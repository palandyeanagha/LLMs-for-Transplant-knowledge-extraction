Predictive value of serum cystatin 
C for acute kidney injury in adults: a 
meta-analysis of prospective cohort 
trials
ZhenzhuYong*, Xiaohua Pei*, Bei Zhu, HaichuanYuan & WeihongZhao
The role of serum cystatin C (Scys) for the detection of acute kidney injury (AKI) has not been fully 
discussed. This meta-analysis was aimed to investigate the overall diagnostic accuracy of Scys for AKI in 
adults, and further identify factors affecting its performance. Studies before Sept. 2016 were retrieved 
from PubMed, Embase, Web of Science and the Cochrane Library. A total of 30 prospective cohort 
studies (involving 4247 adults from 15 countries, 982 patients occurring AKI) were included. The revised 
Quality Assessment for Studies of Diagnostic Accuracy (QUADAS-2) tools demonstrated no significant 
bias had influenced the methodological quality of the included studies. Scys showed a high predictive 
power for all-cause AKI, that the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.89. The 
detailed assessment parameters, such as sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio, negative 
likelihood ratio and diagnostic odds ratio for Scys were 0.82, 0.82, 4.6, 0.22 and 21, respectively. 
Although Scys could be slightly influenced by the following factors: settings, AKI diagnostic criteria, 
ethnicity, determination method, age and gender, these factors above did not reach statistically 
significance. In conclusion, Scys could be a vital promising marker to screen out AKI.
Acute kidney injury (AKI) has been recognized as an independent risk factor for prolonged hospital stay, 
new-onset chronic kidney disease (CKD) and increased mortality rate1,2. Seriously, the prevalence of AKI is 
increasing in recent years3,4: nearly 3–20% for general inpatients, 30–60% for intensive care unit (ICU) patients.
To earlier and more accurate screen out the severe disease, diagnosis criteria for AKI have been updated 
three times: the RIFLE (Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss, End-Stage Kidney Disease) criteria in 2004 year, AKIN (Acute 
Kidney Injury Network) criteria in 2007 year, and the newly 2012 KDIGO (Kidney Disease Improving Global 
Outcomes) criteria5–7. It should be mentioned that all of the three criteria use the same kidney function assess￾ment index: serum creatinine (Scr) and urine output.
However, both Scr and urine output are known as insensitive and nonspecific parameters for renal function 
evaluation. Thus, a great variety of bio-markers has been identified and then applied in the clinical settings in 
recent years8–10. Among the potential markers, serum cystatin C (Scys) performs a consistent accuracy in various 
conditions. For both the healthy individuals and CKD patients, Scys has ever been proposed as a superior marker 
to Scr to evaluate glomerular filtration rate (GFR)11,12.
Recently, based on its physiological metabolism characteristics, that the life cycle of Scys is merely half of 
that of Scr (1.5–2hours vs. 4hours). Namely, once renal function is fluctuating, Scys changes much earlier than 
Scr13,14. Zhang, et al.15 performed a meta-analysis to compare serum and/or urine cystatin C for diagnosis of AKI, 
and then they found Scys appeared to be a better biomarker in the prediction of AKI.
Since then, concerns focused on Scys for AKI prediction have been accelerating. However, with accumu￾lating evidence, conflicting results have raised. Wan et al.16 reported that the predict value (the area under the 
receiver operating characteristic curve, AUROC) of Scys was 0.974, with high sensitivity and specificity, which 
were similar in Liu’s17, Yim’s18 and other studies. In contrast, another studies indicated a negative results. GaygIsIz 
et al.19 and Martensson et al.20 found that the predict values (AUROC) of Scys was 0.67, with low sensitivity and

specificity. Based on these controversial results, we conducted the present meta-analysis to investigate the overall 
diagnostic accuracy of Scys for AKI, and further identify which factors affecting its performance.
Results
Literature search. Our research initially identified 1693 citations, among which, 1537 were excluded as 
they were review articles, animal studies, laboratory reports, pediatric studies, not relevant and duplicate records. 
Thirty studies16–45 finally met the inclusion criteria via full-text evaluation from 156 potentially eligible citations. 
Seven studies21–27 were selected from the previous meta-analysis (Zhang, et al. 2011)15 and an additional 23 stud￾ies16–20,28–45 were complemented in the present meta-analysis. A flow chart of the identification and selection 
process is shown in Fig. 1.
Subjects characteristics and quality assessment. The main characteristics of the included studies were 
summarized in Tables 1 and 2. A total of 4,247 patients (mean age 61.6 years, male 70.9%) from 15 countries were 
enrolled in the 30 studies. The overall AKI incidence was 23.1% (982/4247, varied from 6.0% to 54.3%). The top 
three settings prone to AKI were 32.3% after cardiac surgery, 28.5% in ICU/cardiac care unit (CCU) and 13.8% in 
contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN). The elderly and non-elderly patients suffered from an almost similar AKI 
prevalence (23.1% vs. 22.6%, P>0.05).
The second version of the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) plot demon￾strated no significant bias had influenced the methodological quality of the included studies (Fig. 2).
Predictive value of Scys for AKI. The pooled diagnostic accuracy of Scys was listed in Table 3 and Fig. 3. 
The overall diagnostic sensitivity and specificity was 0.82 (95%CI: 0.75 to 0.87) and 0.82 (95%CI: 0.78 to 0.86), 
respectively. The pooled positive and negative likelihood ratios were 4.6 (95%CI: 3.6–5.9) and 0.22 (95%CI: 
0.16–0.31), respectively and the DOR was 21 (95% CI: 12–35). The overall area under the receiver operating 
characteristic curve (AUROC) reached 0.89. All the results above revealed a good diagnostic accuracy of Scys to 
screen out AKI (Fig. 4).
Threshold analysis and meta-regression analysis. The Spearman correlation coefficient between the 
pooled sensitivity and 1-specitity was −0.277 (P=​ 0.131), indicating no threshold effect. Meta-regression analysis 
showed the following factors irrelevant with accuracy of Scys for AKI: settings, diagnostic criteria, region, Scys 
determination method, participant mean age, gender, sample size (Table 3).
Influence factors affecting Scys of AKI. Various Scys blood sampling point-in-time, cut-off value, and 
determination method resulted in various Scys predictive value for AKI by subgroup analysis (Tables 1,2,3,4). 
Foremost, Twenty-four hours after AKI occurrence to adopt the blood seems to be an optimal time, with sensi￾tivity of 0.82, specificity of 0.83, DOR of 23, and AUROC of 0.89 (Table 4). Besides, 50% elevated from baseline 
could be an ideal cut-off value to predict AKI, with AUROC 0.99 (Table 2). Last but not the least, PETIA per￾formed better than other two determination methods, with sensitivity 0.76, specificity 0.87 and AUROC 0.90 
(Table 3). In addition, several factors other than Scys assay itself were also analyzed in this study, such as AKI

diagnostic criteria, region, gender, age and sample size and et al. Based on the newly KDIGO criteria, Scys per￾formed the best accuracy, with sensitivity 0.78, specificity 0.90 and AUROC 0.92 (Table 3). However, these factors 
mentioned above were not the origin of possible sources of heterogeneity by meta-regression analysis.
Publication bias. No publication bias and high symmetry of the included studies were proved by Deeks’ 
funnel plot asymmetry test (P=0.72; Fig. 5).
Discussion
The overall AKI incidence in this study was 23.1% (982/4247), similar to the prevalence reported in Siew’ study4, 
indicating the disease is still not in control and prevented. The mean age in this meta-analysis achieved 61 years 
old, demonstrating more attention should be taken on the susceptible population: the elderly. Various setting, 
various AKI incidence. The top three settings prone to AKI were cardiovascular surgery, ICU/CCU and radiology

Facing to the severe reality, early diagnosis is crucial to prevent and relieve the prognosis of AKI. Scys has been 
known to be an ideal marker to assess renal function in CKD patients46,47. Whether it is a satisfactory marker to 
predict AKI is still in debate. Thus, to comprehensively and objectively evaluate the value of Scys predicting AKI, 
this meta-analysis set a rigorous inclusion and exclusion criteria at the very start. One of the essential selected 
condition should be prospective cohort studies. After literature searching, 30 studies finally were included. The 
pooled sensitivity, specificity and AUROC of Scys was 0.82, 0.82 and 0.89, respectively. These diagnostic efficiency 
demonstrated that Scys would be an excellent bio-marker for the all-cause AKI prediction.
Further subgroups analysis indicated several influence factors should be noted. Different Scys blood sampling 
point-in-time, cut-off value, and determination method, different Scys predictive value for AKI. If an AKI event 
would occur, it could be suggested that Scys should be determined by PETIA method at 24-hours after the possi￾ble AKI event, referring the diagnostic criteria-50% elevated from baseline. Compared with the previous studies 
results, this advice is rational and acceptable. The blood sampling point-in-time was another focus. Among the 
various time point, 24-hours point after AKI might be a preferable selection.
Otherwise, factors potentially influencing Scys were also assessed in this study. Three main criteria to diag￾nose AKI were presented in Table 3. The newly KDIGO criteria performed an increased diagnostic accuracy in 
Thomas’ study48. The subgroup analysis in this study also confirmed its superiority, that the newly KDIGO criteria 
showed higher specificity and AUROC than the RIFLE criteria and AKIN criteria.
As reported, the most common cause of AKI is acute tubular necrosis (ATN), which could be caused by pro￾longed hypotension, sepsis, surgery, nephrotoxic medications, and contrast media in hospitalized patients49,50. 
Among the three main causes of AKI in this meta-analysis, Scys performed the best accuracy in CIN-AKI. The 
probable reason might be that kidney injury and hemodynamic disorder induced by CIN-AKI is less serious 
and complicate than that by CS-AKI and ICU-AKI. CIN could be the most simple, but also the most important 
AKI model to ascertain the value of Scys. To our knowledge, CIN is the third leading cause of AKI in hos￾pitalized patients51,52. There is a variety of novel bio-markers have been proposed to diagnose CIN. Among 
them, Neutrophil gelatinaseassociated lipocalin (NGAL), interleukin-18 (IL-18) and Scys are the most known

It should be mentioned in the end, the same as the previous CKD studies proved55, Scys was not significantly 
influenced by gender and age in this AKI-related study, as well. Moreover, although settings, AKI diagnostic cri￾teria, race and assay method might play a little bit of influence on the accuracy of Scys, it did not reach statistical 
significance. Thus, these results above showed that Scys could be a nice marker, not only for CKD diagnosis, but 
for AKI prediction.
For all meta-analyses, heterogeneity is a potential problem when interpreting the results. The I2
 statis￾tic was 96% in our meta-analysis, indicating significant heterogeneity across the included studies. One major 
source of heterogeneity is the threshold effect in which different cut-offs are used in the included studies. The 
Spearman correlation analysis in our study indicated no threshold effect related heterogeneity exit. Furthermore, 
meta-regression analysis results revealed that factors potentially affecting Scys did not participate in the hetero￾geneity (p>​ 0.05; Table 3). Thus, we considered that the heterogeneity may be related to additional factors, such 
as specified ethnicity (except from the two race in this study), kidney function, and etc. However, these factors is 
difficult to unify and analyze.
In summary, this meta-analysis demonstrated that Scys shows a good diagnostic performance for predicting 
all-cause AKI. Several factors could affect the predictive value of Scys for AKI, but not reach significant differ￾ences. More randomized controlled trials in multicenter are in need to further investigate the accuracy of Scys.
Methods
Data sources and search strategy. In accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic 
reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines56, we searched PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science and the 
Cochrane Library from the inception to September 2016.
The following terms were used: “AKI, acute kidney injury, acute renal failure, acute renal insufficiency, acute 
renal dysfunction and cystatin C”. References of the selected studies were further screened manually to identify 
whether additional eligible articles were available or not.
Study selection. The inclusion criteria of this study were composed of the following characteristics: (1) 
prospective cohort study, (2) adults, (3) sample size≥​ 30, (4) original data of sensitivity and specificity, (5) AKI 
diagnostic criteria. If any disagreement existed, two investigators would check and discuss about the full text.
Authors were contacted when there were incomplete or missing data. Ethics approval and patients consent 
were not in need for this study.
Data extraction and quality assessment. Two investigators (Z.Z.Y. and X.H.P.) independently extracted 
information from each article using a standardized collection form. Collected parameters included the first

author, publication year, clinical setting, region, age, gender, AKI diagnostic criteria, Scys determination method, 
Scys cut-off value, sensitivity and specificity. Differences were resolved by consensus or the third researcher 
(W.H.Z.).
We investigated the methodological quality of the present study using the second version of the Quality 
Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2)57. QUADAS-2 assesses the risk of bias and applicability 
in four domains: Patient selection (consecutive or random sample enrolled, case–control design and inappropri￾ate exclusions avoided); Index test (blinded interpretation of the Rules); Reference standard (correctly excluded a 
fracture and blinded interpretation); and Flow and timing (appropriate interval between application of the Rules 
and reference standard, all patients received the reference standard and were included in the analysis).
Statistical analysis. A bivariate meta-analytic approach was used to pool sensitivity, specificity, 
DOR, PLR, and NLR. Subsequently, the respective hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic 
(HSROC) curves was constructed to plot sensitivity versus specificity, and then calculate the area under the 
curve. The highest Youden index (sensitivity +​ 1-specificity) of every included studies was chosen to end 
pooled in various Scys measurement times58. We used the I2
 statistic to evaluate the heterogeneity59, and the 
I2 >​ 75% is supposed of significant heterogeneity, the threshold analysis and meta-regression analysis were 
further used to identify possible sources of heterogeneity. Publication bias was estimated by Deeks’ funnel 
plot asymmetry test60. All the data processing and analysis were performed using the midas and metandi 
commands of Stata/SE version 12.0 (Stata Corp LP, College Station, TX) and Meta-Disc 1.4 for Windows 
(XI Cochrane Colloquium, Barcelona, Spain). QUADAS-2 quality assessment was descriptively analyzed 
using Review Manager 5.3 (The Cochrane Collaboration, Copenhagen, Denmark). P < 0.05 was considered 
of statistical significance.
