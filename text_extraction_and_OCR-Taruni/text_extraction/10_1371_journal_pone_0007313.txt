Abstract
Truncating GLI3 mutations in Pallister-Hall Syndrome with renal malformation suggests a requirement for Hedgehog
signaling during renal development. HH-dependent signaling increases levels of GLI transcriptional activators and decreases
processing of GLI3 to a shorter transcriptional repressor. Previously, we showed that Shh-deficiency interrupts early
inductive events during renal development in a manner dependent on GLI3 repressor. Here we identify a novel function for
GLI3 repressor in controlling nephron number. During renal morphogenesis, HH signaling activity, assayed by expression of
Ptc1-lacZ, is localized to ureteric cells of the medulla, but is undetectable in the cortex. Targeted inactivation of Smo, the HH
effector, in the ureteric cell lineage causes no detectable abnormality in renal morphogenesis. The functional significance of
absent HH signaling activity in cortical ureteric cells was determined by targeted deletion of Ptc1, the SMO inhibitor, in the
ureteric cell lineage. Ptc12/2UB mice demonstrate ectopic Ptc1-lacZ expression in ureteric branch tips and renal hypoplasia
characterized by reduced kidney size and a paucity of mature and intermediate nephrogenic structures. Ureteric tip cells are
remarkable for abnormal morphology and impaired expression of Ret and Wnt11, markers of tip cell differentiation. A
finding of renal hypoplasia in Gli32/2 mice suggests a pathogenic role for reduced GLI3 repressor in the Ptc12/2UB mice.
Indeed, constitutive expression of GLI3 repressor via the Gli3D699 allele in Ptc12/2UB mice restores the normal pattern of HH
signaling, and expression of Ret and Wnt11 and rescued the renal phenotype. Thus, GLI3 repressor controls nephron
number by regulating ureteric tip cell expression of Wnt11 and Ret.

Introduction
Development of the permanent mammalian kidney (the
metanephros) is dependent on growth and branching of the
ureteric bud and its daughter branches, a process termed renal
branching morphogenesis. At the onset of this process, the ureteric
bud elongates towards and invades the metanephric mesenchyme
before undergoing spatial specification into ‘ureteric stalk’ and
‘ureteric tip’ domains. Reciprocal inductive interactions between
the ureteric tip and surrounding metanephric mesenchyme results
in division of the ureteric tip, forming the first of a series of ureteric
branches, which ultimately constitute the mature collecting duct
system. Simultaneously, each ureteric bud tip induces adjacent
metanephric mesenchyme cells to undergo a mesenchyme￾epithelial transformation and form the epithelial components
extending from the glomerulus to the distal tubule, a process
known as nephrogenesis. The number of nephrons formed is
directly related to the number of ureteric branches and their
inductive capacity. Severe reductions in nephron number,
characteristic of renal hypoplasia/dysplasia, are the leading cause
of childhood renal failure. More subtle defects in nephron number
have been associated with the development of adult-onset essential
hypertension and chronic renal failure [1,2,3,4,5].
The Hedgehog-GLI signaling pathway plays critical roles
during mammalian kidney development. GLI proteins function
downstream of Hedgehog’s (HH), extracellular proteins, and
Patched (PTC) and Smoothened (SMO), cell surface proteins.
HH ligand signals upon binding to its receptor, PTC, relieving
PTC-mediated inhibition of SMO, a transmembrane protein. In
this state, SMO interacts with a molecular complex including
Costal-2 (Cos2), Fused (Fu) and Suppressor of Fused (SuFu),
ultimately resulting in translocation of GLI protein family
members into the nucleus where they act as transcriptional
activators. In the absence of HH ligand, PTC inhibits SMO
and prevents its interaction with the Cos2-Fu-SuFu complex
resulting in C-terminal cleavage of GLI protein, which
translocates to the nucleus and acts as a transcriptional repressor.
In vertebrates, three GLI family members, GLI1, GLI2 and
GLI3, mediate HH signals. During murine embryogenesis, GLI1
and GLI2 are believed to function primarily as transcriptional
activators while GLI3 is believed to function primarily as a
transcriptional repressor [6,7].

The balance of GLI activator and repressor activities is critical
during renal morphogenesis. Mutations that are predicted to
generate a truncated protein similar in size to GLI3 repressor are
observed in humans with Pallister-Hall Syndrome (PHS) and renal
dysplasia [8]. The pathogenic role of constitutive GLI3 repressor
activity during renal morphogenesis is further demonstrated by the
renal dysplastic phenotype in mice engineered to express GLI3
repressor in a dominant manner [9] and in Shh-deficient mice
[10]. Dysplastic kidney tissue in Shh-deficient mice is characterized
by sustained GLI3 repressor expression in the face of decreased
levels of GLI activators (GLI1, GLI2 and full-length GLI3),
resulting in a shift in the balance of GLI activators and GLI
repressors in favor of repressor [10]. Remarkably, genetic
elimination of Gli3 in the Shh null background restores expression
of GLI activators and normalizes renal morphogenesis [10]. The
expression of Shh in ureteric cells suggests that it may control renal
development via direct effects in the ureteric cell lineage. While
conditional inactivation of Shh in ureteric cells results in renal
hypoplasia, characterized by reduced kidney size and glomerular
number [11], the dependency of this pathogenic phenotype on Shh
signaling in ureteric cells is unknown.
Here we define the specific function of HH signaling in the
ureteric cell lineage during murine kidney development, in genetic
models of deficient or constitutively active signaling. HH signaling
activity is specifically restricted to the ureteric cells of the medulla
and ureter but is absent from the ureteric cell tips of the renal
cortex. Genetic inactivation of Smo in the ureteric cell lineage
exerted no deleterious effects on renal morphogenesis. In contrast,
genetic inactivation of Ptc1 in the ureteric cell lineage caused
ectopic HH signaling activity in ureteric tip cells, impaired ureteric
tip cell-specific gene expression and renal hypoplasia. Genetic
inactivation of Gli3 alone, the primary GLI repressor, resulted in a
similar phenotype suggesting a critical role for GLI3 repressor.
Indeed, introduction of a constitutively active GLI3 repressor in a
Ptc1-deficienct background normalized the renal phenotype,
restored the normal domain of HH signaling activity and rescued
expression of genes specific to ureteric tip cells and required for
their functions. We propose a model in which SHH-SMO
signaling controls the spatial generation of GLI3 repressor, which
is required in the cortical ureteric cells for ureteric tip cell-specific
gene expression and cell function.
Results
Spatial Restriction of HH Signaling Activity to the Renal
Medulla and Ureter
To begin to further investigate the role of SHH signaling
during renal morphogenesis, we examined the expression of Ptc1
utilizing the Ptc1-lacZ reporter mouse [12]. Since Ptc1 is a
downstream target of HH signaling, Ptc1-lacZ expression is
indicative of the site of HH signaling activity [12,13,14]. In the
WT (Ptc1lacZ/+
) kidney at E13.5, Ptc1-lacZ is strongly localized to
cells surrounding the presumptive ureter and the presumptive
medullary stroma (Figure 1A,B), consistent with the pattern of
Ptc1 mRNA expression [11]. Ptc1-lacZ is also weakly localized to
the epithelium of the presumptive ureter and the distal or
medullary collecting ducts (Figure 1A–C). Interestingly, Ptc1-lacZ
expression is not observed in any structures of the presumptive
renal cortex, suggesting that HH signaling activity is restricted to
the ureter and medullary regions of the developing kidney
(Figure 1B,D). At a later stage (E18.5) of kidney development, a
similar pattern of expression is maintained in the cells
surrounding the ureter and medullary stroma (Figure S1A–C).
However, at E18.5, Ptc1-lacZ expression is not observed in any
epithelial structures (Figure S1A–C). Taken together, Ptc1-lacZ
expression in both ureteric and metanephric mesenchyme￾derived structures suggests a role for SHH function in both the
ureteric bud and metanephric mesenchyme lineages of the early
developing kidney but only in the presumptive ureter and
medullary regions.
SHH-SMO-Dependent Signaling is not Required in the
Ureteric Cell Lineage
We began to investigate the possible autocrine functions of
SHH-SMO-dependent signaling by generating a loss of
function model for HH signaling in the ureteric cell lineage.
Smoothened is required for the transduction of all HH signals.
Similar to Shh inactivation, inhibition of SMO with a steroidal
alkaloid, cyclopamine, results in sustained GLI3 repressor in the
absence of GLI activators [10]. Homozygous germline defi￾ciency of Smo in the mouse results in embryonic lethality prior to
the commencement of metanephric development [15]. There￾fore, we utilized Hoxb7creEGFP mice to generate a murine
model in which Smo is genetically inactivated in the ureteric cell
lineage [16,17], thereby eliminating SHH-SMO-dependant
signaling.
Targeted deficiency of Smo in the ureteric cell lineage did not
adversely effect survival since mutants were recovered in the near
expected Mendelian ratios (Table S1). To confirm that Smo is
abolished in Smo2/2UB mutants, we performed quantitative real￾time PCR using ureteric bud tissue isolated at E11.5, a stage that
closely follows metanephric induction. Interestingly, Smo mRNA
transcripts were decreased by ,80% in Smo2/2UB ureteric cells
compared to WT (WT vs. Smo2/2UB: 0.6060.12 vs. 0.1260.08,
p,0.05) (Figure 1E). Consistent with a loss of Smo, analyses of
Ptc1-lacZ in Smo2/2UB kidneys at E13.5 revealed a marked
reduction in HH signaling activity in the ureteric cells of the
ureter and medullary collecting ducts (Figure 1F,G). Examina￾tion of the gross anatomical and histological features of newborn
Smo2/2UB kidneys revealed no major differences compared to
WT kidneys (Figure 1H,I,L,M). Consistent with this observation,
a more detailed analysis of nephrogenic and ureteric structures
using immunofluorescence microscopy and RNA in situ hybrid￾ization revealed that glomerulogenesis, nephrogenesis, nephron
segmentation, ureteric branching morphogenesis and ureteric tip
cell-specific gene expression was normal in Smo2/2UB kidneys
(Figure S2). In order to determine if HH-SMO-dependant
signaling is required in the mature kidney, we also examined
Smo2/2UB kidneys at PN30. No histological abnormalities were
detected in the Smo2/2UB kidneys (Figure 1J,K,N,O). Taken
together, these results demonstrate that HH-SMO-dependent
signaling is not required in the ureteric cell lineage and suggest
that SHH has no autocrine function [in the ureteric cells] during
renal morphogenesis.
A Model of Cortical HH Signaling Activity in the
Embryonic Kidney
Our results demonstrate that HH signaling activity is absent
from the renal cortex. We determined the importance of this
spatial restriction of HH signaling activity by generating a gain-of￾function model in which HH signaling is ectopically activated in
the cortical ureteric epithelium.
Patched1 is a negative regulator of the HH signaling pathway. In
the absence of Ptc1, repression of HH target genes is alleviated, even
in the absence of SHH ligand. Homozygous germline deficiency of
Ptc1 in the mouse results in embryonic lethality prior to the
commencement of metanephric development [12]. Therefore, we

utilized Hoxb7creEGFP mice to generate a murine model in which
Ptc1 is genetically inactivated in the ureteric cell lineage [16,17]
(refer to Methods). To confirm that inactivation of Ptc1 results in a
constitutively active HH signaling pathway in the ureteric
cell lineage, we analyzed Ptc1-lacZ expression in Ptc12/2UB
kidneys. While Ptc1-lacZ expression is maintained in the cells
surrounding the presumptive ureter and presumptive medullary
stroma (Figure 2A,B), Ptc1-lacZ is markedly upregulated in the
epithelium of the presumptive ureter and distal collecting ducts in
Ptc12/2UB kidneys (Figure 1C vs. Figure 2C). Remarkably, Ptc1-lacZ
is ectopically expressed throughout the cortical or proximal
collecting ducts and in the ureteric bud tips (Figure 2A,B,D), albeit
in a mosaic pattern (Figure S1F). A similar pattern of upregulated
and ectopic ureteric bud epithelial Ptc1-lacZ expression was also
observed at a later stage (E18.5) of kidney development (Figure
S1D-F). To confirm that Ptc1 inactivation occurs by an early stage in
renal morphogenesis, we assayed expression of Ptc1 mRNA, a
surrogate marker of HH signaling activity, in ureteric bud tissue
isolated from E11.5 kidney. Quantitative real-time PCR using
primers designed for an undisrupted region of the mutant Ptc1
transcript demonstrated a 50-fold increase in Ptc1 mRNA
transcripts in Ptc12/2UB compared to WT ureteric cells (WT vs.
Ptc12/2UB: 2.2260.02 vs. 108.5166.47, p,0.001) (Figure S3H).
Together, these results show that genetic elimination of PTC1 in the
ureteric cell lineage leads to increased and ectopic HH signaling
activity in the developing kidney.

Ectopic HH Signaling Activity in the Proximal Epithelium
Causes Renal Hypoplasia
Viable neonatal PTC1-deficient pups could not be recovered
(Table S2). However, live Ptc12/2UB mutant embryos were
recovered in expected Mendelian ratios at all embryonic time
points analyzed (Table S2). Macroscopic analyses of Ptc12/2UB
embryos revealed severe exencephaly, with 100% penetrance.
Otherwise, Ptc12/2UB embryos were indistinguishable from WT
littermates (Figure S3). It is therefore likely that Ptc12/2UB
embryos reach term and die and/or are cannibalized immediately
following birth.
Analysis of Ptc12/2UB kidneys at E18.5 revealed renal
hypoplasia, characterized by a 45% reduction in kidney volume
(WT vs. Ptc12/2UB: 163.67638.8761026 mm3 vs. 90.72624.056
1026 mm3
, p,0.01) and reduced density of medullary epithelial
tubules (Figure 2E,I,M). The extent of reduction in Ptc12/2UB
kidney size was variable, exhibiting a 1.7 fold range, but was 100%
penetrant. Histological analyses of the renal cortex of Ptc12/2UB
kidneys revealed a paucity of mature glomeruli and nephrogenic
intermediate structures in the nephrogenic zone (Figure 2F,J).
Glomerular number in Ptc12/2UB kidneys was decreased by
45% in comparison to WT littermates (WT vs. Ptc12/2UB:
692.226116.35 vs. 374.25668.79, p,0.001) (Figure 2N). A
deficiency in nephrogenic structures in Ptc12/2UB kidneys was
confirmed by examining the expression of PAX2, a marker of
condensing mesenchyme and early nephrogenic structures
(Figure 2G,K) and LTL, a marker of proximal tubules (Figure 2
H,L). A reduction in the number of intermediate nephrogenic
structures was also observed in Ptc12/2UB kidneys by histology at
E15.5 (Figure 2O,P). However, no difference in renal histology or
the number of nephrogenic intermediate structures was observed
between WT and Ptc12/2UB kidneys at E13.5 suggesting that
nephrogenesis is unaffected at that stage (Figure S4). Together,
these results demonstrate that PTC1-deficiency leads to deficient
nephrogenesis.
Ureteric branching is required for nephron formation. Since
ureteric branch tips induce contiguous metanephric mesenchyme
cells to engage in nephron formation, the number of ureteric
branches is considered to be a critical determinant of the number
of nephrons generated. To determine the effect of Ptc1-deficiency
on early ureteric branching morphogenesis we quantified ureteric
branching at E12.5 by whole mount immunofluorescence using
Calbindin-D28K, a marker of ureteric bud epithelium. No
significant difference in the number of ureteric branches was
observed between WT and Ptc12/2UB kidneys (Figure 2Q,R and
Figure S4F). However, we did observe abnormalities in the
ureteric branch pattern. In contrast to WT kidneys, several
irregularly shaped and dilated ureteric bud tips were observed in
Ptc12/2UB kidneys (Figure 2Q,R). Analyses of ureteric branching
morphogenesis a day later at E13.5 revealed a mild reduction in
ureteric branch number in Ptc12/2UB kidneys compared to
controls (Figure 2S,T). At E15.5, this reduction was more even
more pronounced (Figure 2U,V). Importantly, normal renal
architecture is maintained in Ptc12/2UB kidneys. Taken together,
these results demonstrate that ectopic HH signaling activity in
proximal ureteric cells causes renal hypoplasia, characterized by
marked defects in the formation of nephrogenic structures,
reduced ureteric branching and a qualitative defect in early stage
ureteric branch tips.
Effect of Ptc1-Deficiency on Proliferation and Apoptosis
Cell proliferation is crucial for ureteric branching morphogen￾esis and nephrogenesis. Since SHH signaling controls renal cell
proliferation [10] we investigated the possible contributions of
abnormal cell proliferation to the hypoplastic phenotype in PTC1-
deficient kidneys at E13.5, a time point prior to the onset of the
phenotype. Analysis of cell proliferation, using an in situ BrdU
incorporation assay, revealed a 40% decrease in ureteric bud cell
proliferation in Ptc12/2UB kidneys at E13.5 (WT vs. Ptc12/2UB:
38.465.6 vs. 23.169.0, p = 0.05) (Figure 3A–C). In contrast, no
significant difference in mesenchymal cell proliferation was
detected (WT vs. Ptc12/2UB: 2.6860.7 vs. 2.0560.6, p = 0.25)
(Figure 3A,B,D).
Mesenchyme cell survival is critical to nephrogenesis. Moreover,
elevated ureteric bud apoptosis has been implicated in the
pathogenesis of renal hypoplasia [18]. Accordingly, we determined
whether cell survival was impaired in PTC1-deficient kidneys at
E13.5 (Figure S5). Analysis of apoptosis, using a TUNEL assay,
revealed no significant difference in ureteric bud or metanephric
mesenchyme cell death in Ptc12/2UB kidneys.
Taken together, these results suggest that enhanced and ectopic
HH signaling activity in the ureteric cell lineage decreases ureteric
cell proliferation but does not affect apoptosis.
Ectopic HH Signaling Activity in the Proximal Ureteric
Epithelium Impairs Expression of Wnt11 and Ret in
Ureteric Bud Tip Cells
Our findings of renal hypoplasia, abnormal ureteric tip
morphology and decreased ureteric cell proliferation (in Ptc12/2UB
kidneys) suggested that ectopic HH signaling activity in ureteric
tips disrupts normal ureteric tip function.
Specification of ureteric bud tip cells distinct from ureteric stalk
cells is essential for ureteric branching morphogenesis and
nephrogenesis. Determination of ureteric tip cell fate is dependant
on Gdnf/Ret signaling [19]. Furthermore, Gdnf/Ret signaling is
required for the maintenance of Wnt11 expression, also in the
ureteric bud tips cells [20,21]. Conversely, Wnt11 promotes Gdnf
expression in the surrounding metanephric mesenchyme suggesting
that Gdnf, Ret and Wnt11 participate in an autoregulatory feedback
loop to regulate ureteric branching morphogenesis [20]. We
examined the effect of ectopic HH signaling activity on ureteric
tip cell-specific gene expression using in situ hybridization. In
contrast to WT kidneys, expression of Ret and Wnt11 was markedly
reduced in the majority of ureteric bud tips in Ptc12/2UB kidneys at
E13.5 (Figure 3E–H). Consistent with the autoregulatory feedback
loop, expression of Gdnf in the surrounding metanephric mesen￾chyme was also markedly reduced in the Ptc12/2UB kidneys
(Figure 3I,J). The specificity of decreased Gdnf expression in
Ptc12/2UB kidneys is demonstrated by normal expression of Osr1,
Six2, and CITED1, each of which marks mesenchymal precursor
cells [22,23,24,25,26]; Wnt4, a marker of pretubular aggregates
[27]; and Wnt9b which is required for the earliest inductive response
in metanephric mesenchyme and acts upstream of Wnt4 [28]
(Figure S6). To further investigate the ontogeny of abnormal
ureteric tip cell gene expression in Ptc12/2UB mice, we assayed Ret
and Wnt11 expression in isolated ureteric bud tissue using
quantitative real-time PCR. At E11.5, a stage that immediately
follows induction of the metanephric mesenchyme by the ureteric
bud, expression of Ret was comparable between WT and Ptc12/2UB
ureteric cells (WT vs. Ptc12/2UB: 1.6560.37 vs. 1.5060.61,
p = 0.78) (Figure 3M). In contrast, Wnt11 expression was reduced
by ,70% in Ptc12/2UB ureteric cells (WT vs. Ptc12/2UB: 1.7960.26
vs. 0.5160.27, p,0.05) (Figure 3N). Taken together, these results
demonstrate that ectopic HH signaling activity in the proximal
ureteric epithelium specifically impairs the expression of Wnt11 and
Ret in ureteric tip cells.
Our results indicate that HH signaling activity is normally
restricted to the distal ureteric cells of the ureter and medulla.

Given the impairment of tip cell gene expression, we investigated
the possibility that HH signaling activity biases ureteric cells
towards a distal cell fate. To determine whether Ptc12/2UB tips
cells had adopted characteristics of the ureteric stalk we performed
DBA-lectin whole mount immunofluorescence microscopy on WT
and Ptc12/2UB kidneys at E13.5. DBA is a marker of the ureteric
stalk but not the ureteric tip [29]. DBA expression was observed in
ureteric tips in Ptc12/2UB kidneys in a mosaic pattern but rarely in
WT kidneys (Figure 3K,L and Figure S5E–H). The expression of
Wnt7b, another marker of ureteric stalk that is absent from the
ureteric tips [30], was comparable between WT and Ptc12/2UB
kidneys. Since ectopic HH signaling activity is also observed in
proximal collecting ducts in mutant kidneys, we next investigated
the possibility that HH signaling activity biases cortical collecting
ducts towards a more medullary/distal cell fate. Expression of
uroplakin III, a marker of the transitional epithelium of the ureter
and renal pelvis, was unchanged in the Ptc12/2UB kidneys (Figure
S7A–F). Similarly, the localization of aSMA, a marker of the
smooth muscle population surrounding the ureter, was also
unaltered (Figure S7G–L). Together, these results suggest that

ectopic HH signaling activity in the proximal epithelium does not
induce a distal ureteric bud cell fate. Furthermore, increased HH
signaling activity in the distal epithelium (ureter and distal
collecting ducts) has no deleterious effects on these structures.
Reduced Levels of GLI Repressor in the Renal Cortex
Result in Renal Hypoplasia
The spatial restriction of HH signaling activity from the renal
cortex during normal renal morphogenesis suggests that the cortex
is a GLI repressor-dominant domain. We hypothesized that the
deleterious effects of ectopic HH signaling in the proximal ureteric
cells in Ptc12/2UB kidneys is due to a reduction in local GLI
repressor levels. We addressed this hypothesis by analyzing kidneys
in Gli3-deficient embryos.
GLI3 is the primary source of GLI repressor in mammalian cells
[31]. Mice with homozygous deficiency in Gli3 die soon after birth
or in late gestation [32]. We were able to recover viable Gli3-
deficient embryos as late as E18.5. Gli3-deficient embryos
exhibited polysyndactyly and occasional exencephaly but were
similar in size to WT littermates (data not shown). Gli3+/XtJ mice
kidneys were indistinguishable from WT littermates (data not
shown). Analysis of Gli3XtJ/XtJ kidneys at E18.5 revealed mild
hypoplasia, characterized by a 15% decrease in kidney volume
(p,0.05) and 15% reduction in glomerular number (p,0.05)
compared to WT littermates (Figure 4). Otherwise, glomerulogen￾esis, nephron segmentation, and smooth muscle and urothelium
differentiation was normal in Gli3XtJ/XtJ kidneys (Figure S8). These
results are consistent with a functional role for GLI repressor in the
renal cortex during renal morphogenesis.
GLI3 Repressor is Required for Ureteric Tip Cell
Expression of Wnt11 and Ret
We further tested the contribution of GLI repressor in the
proximal epithelium by reinstating GLI3 repressor levels in the
Ptc12/2UB mutants. We generated mice with both Ptc1-deficiency
targeted to the ureteric cells and with one allele of WT Gli3
replaced with Gli3D699, a constitutively active repressor form of
GLI3. To determine what effect, if any, the reinstatement of GLI3
repressor had on HH signaling activity we analyzed Ptc1-lacZ in
the Ptc12/2UB;Gli3D699/+ kidneys. In the Ptc12/2UB;Gli3D699/+
kidney at E13.5, Ptc1-lacZ expression is maintained in the cells
surrounding the presumptive ureter and medullary stroma,
consistent with the expression in WT and Ptc12/2UB kidneys
(Figure 5A,C,E). However, in contrast to ectopic Ptc1-lacZ
expression throughout the proximal ureteric cells in Ptc12/2UB
kidneys, the proximal collecting ducts and ureteric cell tips are
devoid of Ptc1-lacZ expression in Ptc12/2UB;Gli3D699/+ kidneys
(Figure 5A–F). These results suggest that reinstatement of GLI3
repressor in Ptc12/2UB kidneys, restores the normal pattern of HH
signaling activity to the medullary and ureter domains and
eliminates ectopic HH signaling activity in the renal cortex. Next
we analyzed ureteric tip cell gene expression in Ptc12/2UB;
Gli3D699/+ kidneys. Remarkably, expression of Ret and Wnt11 was
restored to comparable levels of that observed in WT and
Gli3D699/+ controls suggesting a rescue of ureteric tip cell
differentiation (Figure 3E,H, Figure 5G,J, Figure S9). Further￾more, consistent with a rescue of Ret and Wnt11 expression, Gdnf
expression was also restored by the reinstatement of GLI3
repressor (Figure 3I,J, Figure 5K,L, Figure S9). Moreover,
macroscopic analysis of Ptc12/2UB;Gli3D699/+ kidneys at E18.5
demonstrated a rescue in kidney size, comparable to that observed
in WT littermates (Figure 5M,O,Q). In fact, kidney volume was
significantly restored from 55% in Ptc12/2UB kidneys alone, to
92% in Ptc12/2UB;Gli3D699/+ kidneys in comparison to WT kidney
volume (WT vs. Ptc12/2UB;Gli3D699/+
, p.0.05; Ptc12/2UB vs.
Ptc12/2UB;Gli3D699/+
, p,0.05) (Figure 5S). Remarkably, histolog￾ical analyses of the renal cortex also revealed a rescue in
nephrogenesis in Ptc12/2UB;Gli3D699/+ kidneys (Figure 5N,P,R).
In contrast to a 45% deficit in Ptc12/2UB kidneys, glomerular
number in Ptc12/2UB;Gli3D699/+ kidneys was significantly restored
to 85% of that of WT littermates (WT vs. Ptc12/2UB;Gli3D699/+
,
p.0.05; Ptc12/2UB vs. Ptc12/2UB;Gli3D699/+
, p,0.05) (Figure 5T).
Taken together, these results demonstrate a requirement for GLI3
repressor for ureteric tip cell gene expression and function.
Discussion
Disruption of renal development in humans with Pallister-Hall
Syndrome and truncating GLI3 mutations [33] and mice with
elevated levels of GLI3 repressor [9,10] provides compelling
evidence in favor of a critical role for GLI3-dependent signaling
during mesenchymal-epithelial interactions during early stages of

metanephric development. However, the functions of HH
signaling during subsequent morphogenic events including
nephrogenesis are unknown.
Here, we demonstrate that domains of GLI-dependent activator
and repressor function are spatially patterned during renal
morphogenesis. We investigated the functional significance of
these domains in the ureteric cell lineage using genetic murine
models of deficient or constitutively active HH signaling. Smo￾deficiency targeted to the ureteric cell lineage does not disrupt
kidney development, demonstrating HH-dependent GLI activa￾tors are not required for ureteric cell function. The absence of HH
signaling in the renal cortex of WT mice suggests that the cortex is
a zone of low GLI activator and high GLI repressor levels. We
determined the importance of exclusion of HH signaling activity
from the cortical collecting ducts in mice with Ptc1-deficiency
targeted to the UB lineage. Absence of ureteric cell Ptc1, a negative
regulator of the HH signaling pathway, results in ectopic HH
signaling activity in the cortical collecting ducts and ureteric bud
tips. Ectopic HH signaling activity in the ureteric bud tips, which
under normal circumstances is a domain of GLI repressor
function, leads to decreased expression of Ret and Wnt11. These
changes result in disruption of ureteric branching morphogenesis
and nephrogenesis resulting in renal hypoplasia, likely due to
impaired tip function. Remarkably, constitutive GLI3 repressor
expression in the Ptc12/2UB background, restores ureteric tip cell￾specific gene expression and normalizes renal morphogenesis,
demonstrating a spatial requirement for GLI3 repressor in the
proximal ureteric cells. Together, these results demonstrate a
requirement for GLI3 repressor-dependent regulation of nephron
number via ureteric tip cell Wnt11- and Ret-dependent functions.
Regulation of Ureteric Tip Cell Differentiation by GLI3
Repressor
We have established that loss of GLI3 repressor impairs ureteric
tip cells by reducing Ret and Wnt11 expression. The precise
mechanism by which GLI-dependent signaling may control Ret
and Wnt11 is unclear. Decreased expression of Wnt11 precedes a
decrease in Ret expression in the ureteric bud tips of Ptc12/2UB
kidneys. Wnt11 maintains Gdnf expression in the mesenchyme
[20]. Thus, it is probable that reduced Gdnf expression in
Ptc12/2UB mice is secondary to decreased Wnt11 expression in
ureteric tip cells. Consistent with this, Wnt11 null mice exhibit mild
renal hypoplasia and a reduction in Gdnf expression [20] almost
identical to that observed in Ptc12/2UB mutants.
The mosaic expression of Ptc1-lacZ expression in the ureteric tips
suggests that not all tip cells were exposed to ectopic HH signaling.
This explains, in part, why Ret and Wnt11 expression is not
completely abolished from the ureteric tips and why expression
levels are variable among tips within the same kidney. It is tempting
to speculate that the extent of ‘chimerism’ of a ureteric tip may
influence the efficiency of its function. The ability of ‘mutant’ tips to
confer some function in Ptc12/2UB kidneys could account for the
mild phenotype since complete abolishment of Gdnf/Ret signaling
would result in renal agenesis [34,35,36]. Impairment of tip cell
gene expression has also been reported in mice with deletion of b￾catenin targeted to the ureteric cells [37]. Consistent with our
findings, b-catenin-deficient mice demonstrate reduced expression
of Ret, Wnt11 and Gdnf and dilated ureteric tips. However, while
early ureteric branching is normal in Ptc12/2UB kidneys, it is
arrested in b-catenin mutants resulting in severe renal dysplasia.
Thus, it is likely that some residual inducing function is maintained
in the ureteric tips in Ptc12/2UB mice during early stages of kidney
development. However, the participation of Gdnf, Ret and Wnt11 in
an autoregulatory feedback loop to regulate ureteric branching
morphogenesis is likely to exacerbate the early decrement in Wnt11,
Ret, and Gdnf contributing to the progressively more severe
branching phenotype we observed in Ptc12/2UB mice.
Gli2 and Gli3 can serve both redundant activator and repressor
functions in a number of mammalian tissues [31,38,39].
Therefore, it is not surprising that the effect of Gli3-deficiency
alone is less severe than that observed in conditional deletion of
Ptc1. Constitutive activity of the HH signaling pathway, such as
that in Ptc12/2UB kidneys, is expected to inhibit the formation of
both Gli2 and Gli3 repressor isoforms. However, the capacity for
the formation of Gli2 repressor isoforms remains intact in Gli3-
deficient kidneys allowing for partial redundancy. Early lethality
prior to the onset of metanephric development in the majority of
Gli2;Gli3 compound null mutants [31] limits the ability to
investigate this functional redundancy in greater detail.
HH signaling is a known regulator of proliferation in
mammalian tissues. Indeed, mutations in Ptc1 are associated with
increased incidence of tumorigenesis [12]. In contrast, we
observed a moderate decreased in ureteric cell proliferation in
Ptc1-deficient kidneys. Gdnf/Ret signaling has been shown to
activate intracellular signaling pathways including the ERK MAP
kinase pathway [40]. In the kidney, activation of this pathway
leads to cellular events, including cell proliferation, cell survival
and migration, and inhibition of this pathway results in reduced
ureteric branching [41]. Therefore, reduced Ret and Gdnf
expression in Ptc12/2UB kidneys could result in the observed
reduction in proliferation. Consistent with this, the absence of a
phenotype in Smo2/2UB kidneys suggests HH signaling is not
required for ureteric cell proliferation.
Inactivating mutations in Gli3 and Ptc1 have been identified in
humans with Greig Cephalopolysyndactyly Syndrome (GCPS)
and Nevoid Basal Cell Carcinoma Syndrome (NBCCS, also
known as Gorlin Syndrome) respectively [32,42]. Pertinent to the
phenotype, mutations would lead to loss of GLI3 repressor and
PTC1-deficiency respectively. Yet, currently no known association
between human Gli3 inactivation or Ptc1 mutations and renal
malformation exists. This is likely due to a number of reasons.
Firstly, analysis of kidneys in patients with GCPS or NBCCS has
not been performed. Our results provide a basis for analyses of
kidney size in affected individuals. Secondly, the degree of
haploinsufficiency in humans with Ptc1 mutations may be
insufficient to result in a renal phenotype. Ptc1 heterozygous
mutant mice exhibit phenotypes similar to those observed in
humans with BNCCS [12], yet we did not observe any renal
abnormalities in these mice. Furthermore, Ptc1 homozygous null
mice are embryonic lethal suggesting that Ptc1 homozygous null
mutations in humans are also incompatible with life [12]. Further,
mutational analysis in humans exhibiting sporadic renal hypopla￾sia for genes involved in HH signaling, including Gli3 and Ptc1, is
also warranted, as done for other genes [43,44].
SHH Does Not Signal in a Autocrine Manner During Renal
Morphogenesis
We show that HH signaling activity is not required in the
ureteric bud lineage for normal renal morphogenesis. This is
consistent with previous results demonstrating metanephric
mesenchyme as the primary target of SHH signaling [11].
Analysis of mice deficient in Shh the ureteric bud lineage revealed
that Shh secreted by the epithelium of the ureter and distal
collecting ducts acts on the surrounding mesenchyme to promote
cell proliferation and regulate the timing and patterning of smooth
muscle progenitor differentiation [11]. Since we have genetically
eliminated Smo in the ureteric bud only, Shh is still capable of
paracrine signaling, acting on the surrounding stroma and

mesenchyme. In addition, recent in vitro and in vivo data in the
pancreas, has suggested additional, non-canonical, mechanisms of
GLI activation, downstream of SMO, via two HH-unrelated
pathways, RAS and TGFb [45,46,47]. Whether non-canonical
GLI activation occurs during renal morphogenesis remains
unknown.
A Model of Spatial GLI Activator and Repressor
Functional Domains
We propose a model whereby distinct SHH-dependent
medullary GLI activator domain and cortical repressor domain
functions are critical for normal renal ureteric patterning and
function (Figure 6). It is likely these domains are established by a
SHH gradient, emitted by the ureteric cells of the medullary
collecting ducts. While SHH signaling is not required in the
medullary collecting ducts themselves, the absence of signal in
cortical ureteric cells, contributed to by diminishing SHH
concentration and/or pathway inhibitors, is critical for ureteric
tip cell gene expression required for ureteric branching and
nephron induction. Identification of GLI3 repressor gene targets
will provide novel insights into this novel mechanism of ureteric tip
cell regulation and function. The presence of renal agenesis/
dysplasia in humans with Pallister-Hall syndrome and GLI3
repressor dominant murine models [9,10] suggests that a fine
spatial and lineage-specific balance of GLI activator and GLI
repressor must be maintained for normal renal morphogenesis.
Furthermore, these results implicate misregulation of HH signaling
as a possible underlying mechanism in unexplained human renal
dysplasia.
Materials and Methods
Ethics Statement
Experiments using mice were approved in advance by the
Animal Ethics Committee at The Hospital for Sick Children and
were carried out in accordance with the ‘Canadian Council of Animal
Care.’
Mice
Hoxb7creEGFP mice [17] were mated to Ptc1+/2, Ptc1+/lacZ [12] or
Smo+/2 [15] mice to generate Hoxb7creEGFP;Ptc+/2, Hoxb7-
creEGFP;Ptc+/lacZ and Hoxb7creEGFP;Smo+/2 males. These males were
mated to homozygous Ptc1 conditional (Ptc1neo/neo) [48] or Smo
conditional (Smoc/c) [49] females to generate Hoxb7creEGFP;Ptc12/neo,
Hoxb7creEGFP;Ptc1lacZ/neo and Hoxb7creEGFP;Smo2/c progeny in which
Ptc1 or Smo was specifically removed from the UB lineage. These
kidneys are referred to as ‘Ptc12/2UB’ or ‘Smo2/2UB’ in the text.
Hoxb7creEGFP;Ptc12/neo, Hoxb7creEGFP;Ptc1lacZ/neo mutant kidneys
were indistinguishable, displaying the same phenotype. Gli3D699/+
mice [9] were mated to Ptc1neo/neo mice to ultimately generate
Ptc1neo/neo;Gli3D699/+ mice. Hoxb7creEGFP;Ptc1+/2 or Hoxb7-
creEGFP;Ptc1+/lacZ males were mated to Ptc1neo/neo;Gli3D699/+ females
to generate Hoxb7creEGFP;Ptc12/neo;Gli3D699/+ or Hoxb7creEGFP;
Ptc1lacZ/neo;Gli3D699/+ progeny, referred to as ‘Ptc12/2UB;Gli3D699/+
’
in the text. Gli3XtJ/+ heterozygote mice [32] were intercrossed to
generate Gli3XtJ/XtJ embryos.
Analysis of HH signaling activity was achieved by mating Ptc1-
lacZ mice [12] to Hoxb7creEGFP mice or Smoc/c mice to generate
Hoxb7creEGFP;Ptc1+/lacZ males or Smoc/c;Ptc1+/lacZ females. Hoxb7-
creEGFP;Ptc1+/lacZ males were mated to Ptc1neo/neo females to
generate Hoxb7creEGFP;Ptc1lacZ/neo (Ptc1lacZ/2UB) progeny that
contain the Ptc1-lacZ reporter allele and in which Ptc1 is
specifically removed from the UB lineage. Hoxb7creEGFP;Smo+/2
males were mated to Smoc/c;Ptc1+/lacZ females to generate
Hoxb7creEGFP;Smo2/c;Ptc1+/lacZ progeny that contain the Ptc1-lacZ
reporter allele and in which Smo is eliminated from the UB lineage.
PCR genotyping for each allele was performed as previously
described [12,15,17,48,49]. Gli3XtJ heterozygote and homozygous
mice were genotyped according to their characteristic limb
phenotypes [32,50].
Figure 6. Model for HH signaling function in the ureteric epithelium. (A) During normal renal morphogenesis, Shh secreted from the
medullary collecting ducts (purple) establishes a gradient of HH signaling resulting in distinct medullary GLI activator (blue) and cortical GLI repressor
domains. While HH signaling activity has no functional requirement in the ureteric cell lineage, the absence of HH signal, and thereby function of GLI3
repressor is critical for ureteric tip cell-specific gene expression and subsequent nephron induction (B). In the absence of cortical GLI repressor, such
as in Ptc12/2UB mice, ureteric tip cell-specific gene expression is impaired resulting in reduced nephrogenesis and renal hypoplasia.

Embryonic day 0.5 (E0.5) was considered to be noon on the day
of the plug. Littermates were used for all experiments in which
normal and mutant embryos were compared.
b-galactosidase staining
Whole kidneys were briefly fixed in lacZ fix solution (25%
gluteraldehyde, 100 nM EGTA, 1 M MgCl2, 0.1 M sodium
phosphate) and rinsed in wash buffer (0.1 M sodium phosphate
buffer, 2% nonidet-P40), 1 M MgCl2). Kidneys were then placed
in lacZ staining solution (25 mg/ml X-gal, potassium ferrocyanide,
potassium ferricyanide) at 37uC overnight in the dark. Once
staining had occurred the reaction was terminated in wash buffer
and post-fixed in 10% buffered formalin at 4uC. Whole kidneys
were photographed using a Lieca EZ4D dissecting microscope and
processed for embedding in paraffin wax and sectioned at 5 mm.
Sections were counterstained with eosin or nuclear fast red.
Histology and immunohistochemistry
Paraffin-embedded kidney sections were analyzed by histology
after generating 4 mm tissue sections and staining with haematox￾ylin and eosin. Immunofluorescence was performed on formalin￾fixed, paraffin-embedded kidney sections using anti-Pax2 (Cov￾ance, Berkley, CA, 1:100 dilution), anti-pan cytokeratin (Sigma, St
Louis, MO, 1:100 dilution), Lotus Tetragonolobus lectin (LTL)
(Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, 1:100 dilution), anti￾NCAM (Sigma, 1:50 dilution), anti-WT1 (Santa Cruz, Santa
Cruz, CA, 1:500 dilution), anti-a smooth muscle actin (aSMA)
(Sigma, 1:500 dilution), anti-uroplakin III (Progen Biotechnik,
Heidelberg, Germany, 1:10 dilution), anti-Cited1 (Labvision,
1:500 dilution). Alexa 488 goat anti-mouse and Alexa 568 goat
anti-rabbit (Molecular Probes, Carlsbad, CA, 1:1000 dilution)
were used as secondary antibodies. Whole mount immunofluore￾sence was performed as described [51] with anti-Calbindin-D28K
(Sigma, 1:200 dilution; secondary is Alexa 488 goat anti-mouse,
Molecular Probes, 1:100 dilution) and Dolichos Biflorus Agglutin
(DBA)-lectin (Vector Laboratories, 1:200 dilution).
In situ mRNA hybridization
Whole embryos were fixed in 4% PFA in PBS for 16 h at 4uC. In
situ hybridization was performed on paraffin-embedded sections
(4 mm) using DIG-labeled cDNA probes encoding Ret, Wnt11, Gdnf,
Wnt4, Six2, Wnt7b, Wnt9b and Osr1 as previously described [52].
In situ TUNEL assay, BrdU incorporation assay
Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)-mediated dUTP
nick end labeling (TUNEL) was performed using formalin fixed
paraffin-embedded tissue sections as described in the manufactur￾er’s instructions (Promega, Madison, WI). Cell proliferation was
assayed in formalin fixed paraffin-embedded kidney tissue by
incorporation of 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU, Roche Molecu￾lar Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany), as described [53].
Briefly, pregnant females received an intraperitoneal injection of
BrdU (100 mg/g of body weight) 2 h prior to sacrifice. BrdU￾positive cells were identified using anti-BrdU peroxidase-conju￾gated antibody as described (Boehringer, Mannhiem). Immuno￾reactivity was visualized using Aminoethyl Carbazole horseradish
peroxidase chromogen/substrate solution (Zymed Laboratories,
USA).
Ureteric bud isolation and real-time reverse transcriptase￾PCR
Kidneys from E11.5 WT, Smo2/2UB and Ptc1lacZ/2UB mice were
dissected and incubated in DMEM/Hams-F12 culture media
(GIBCO) containing 10% FCS and 0.2% Collagenase-B (Roche
Diagnostics) for 10 min at 37uC. Kidneys were washed in ice-cold
media containing 10% FCS and ureteric buds and metanephric
mesenchyme were isolated by microdissection using 30 g needles.
Ureteric buds were stored in RNAlater RNA stabilization reagent
(Qiagen) and RNA was then isolated using the RNAqueous-Micro
RNA Isolation kit (Ambion Inc.). cDNA was generated using First
Strand cDNA Synthesis (Invitrogen) from total RNA. Real-time
PCR reaction mix contained 1 ng of each cDNA sample, SYBR
green PCR Mix (Applied Biosystems) and 300 nM of each primer
to a total volume of 25 ml. Primers for Smo (Exon 1), Ptc1 (Exon 3),
Ret and Wnt11 were designed using Primer 3 software and verified
using the UCSC genome bioinformatics website (genome.ucs￾c.edu). Real-time PCR Amplification was performed using the
Applied Biosystems 7900 HT fast RT-PCR system. Relative levels
of mRNA expression were determined using the standard curve
method. Individual expression values were normalized by
comparison to b-2 Microglobulin.
Calculation of kidney volume and the number of
glomeruli
Kidney volume and glomerular number was measured
according to Bertram et al. [54] with the following modifications:
kidneys embedded in paraffin were exhaustively sectioned at
5 mm, collected at 100 mm intervals and stained with Haematox￾ylin and Eosin. The area of the tissue section was measured with
AxioVision 4.6.3-SP1 (Zeiss) and multiplied by the section
thickness. Total kidney volume is the sum of volumes for each
section. Glomeruli were identified by the presence of both a
podocyte layer and Bowman’s capsule.
Data analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism
software (Version 3.01) (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego,
CA). Data were analyzed using a Student’s t-test (two tailed). A
probability of less than 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical
significance. Values are given as means6SD or SEM.

in WT and Ptc12/2UB kidneys (WT vs. Ptc12/2UB: 0.23+0.03 vs
0.19+0.04, p = 0.46). n = nephrogenic structure. (E–H) Whole
mount Calbinidin-D28K and DBA-lectin immunofluorescence at
E13.5. Calbindin-D28K is expressed in both ureteric stalks and tips
in WT and Ptc12/2UB kidneys (E,F). DBA-lectin localizes
predominantly to the ureteric stalk in WT kidneys and is excluded
from the ureteric tips (G). In Ptc12/2UB kidneys DBA-lectin is
observed throughout the ureteric tips and ureteric stalks (H). (I,J)
Wnt7b is expressed in the ureteric stalks (arrow) but is absent from
ureteric tips (arrowhead) in both WT and Ptc12/2UB kidneys.
