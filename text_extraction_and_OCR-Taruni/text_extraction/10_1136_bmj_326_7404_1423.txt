Quantifying effect of statins on low density lipoprotein
cholesterol, ischaemic heart disease, and stroke: systematic
review and meta-analysis
M R Law, N J Wald, A R Rudnicka
Abstract
Objectives To determine by how much statins reduce
serum concentrations of low density lipoprotein
(LDL) cholesterol and incidence of ischaemic heart
disease (IHD) events and stroke, according to drug,
dose, and duration of treatment.
Design Three meta-analyses: 164 short term
randomised placebo controlled trials of six statins and
LDL cholesterol reduction; 58 randomised trials of
cholesterol lowering by any means and IHD events;
and nine cohort studies and the same 58 trials on
stoke.
Main outcome measures Reductions in LDL
cholesterol according to statin and dose; reduction in
IHD events and stroke for a specified reduction in
LDL cholesterol.
Results Reductions in LDL cholesterol (in the 164
trials) were 2.8 mmol/l (60%) with rosuvastatin 80
mg/day, 2.6 mmol/l (55%) with atorvastatin 80
mg/day, 1.8 mmol/l (40%) with atorvastatin 10
mg/day, lovastatin 40 mg/day, simvastatin 40 mg/day,
or rosuvastatin 5 mg/day, all from pretreatment
concentrations of 4.8 mmol/l. Pravastatin and
fluvastatin achieved smaller reductions. In the 58
trials, for an LDL cholesterol reduction of 1.0 mmol/l
the risk of IHD events was reduced by 11% in the first
year of treatment, 24% in the second year, 33% in
years three to five, and by 36% thereafter (P < 0.001
for trend). IHD events were reduced by 20%, 31%, and
51% in trials grouped by LDL cholesterol reduction
(means 0.5 mmol/l, 1.0 mmol/l, and 1.6 mmol/l) after
results from first two years of treatment were excluded
(P < 0.001 for trend). After several years a reduction of
1.8 mmol/l would reduce IHD events by an estimated
61%. Results from the same 58 trials, corroborated by
results from the nine cohort studies, show that
lowering LDL cholesterol decreases all stroke by 10%
for a 1 mmol/l reduction and 17% for a 1.8 mmol/l
reduction. Estimates allow for the fact that trials
tended to recruit people with vascular disease, among
whom the effect of LDL cholesterol reduction on
stroke is greater because of their higher risk of
thromboembolic stroke (rather than haemorrhagic
stroke) compared with people in the general
population.
Conclusions Statins can lower LDL cholesterol
concentration by an average of 1.8 mmol/l which
reduces the risk of IHD events by about 60% and
stroke by 17%.
Introduction
Statins are highly effective in lowering serum
cholesterol concentrations and preventing ischaemic
heart disease (IHD).1–3 Three issues remain. We do not
know by how much different statins at different doses
reduce low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol con￾centrations. There are indications from previous
studies,4 5 but there has been no systematic review of
placebo controlled trials. Secondly, the full effect of
statins in preventing IHD events has not been
specified. The 30% reduction shown in meta-analyses
of major randomised trials1–3 underestimates the full
effect because IHD events in the first two years (before
the full effect of reducing serum LDL cholesterol con￾centrations is achieved6
) were not censored, many trials
used less effective statins, and trials were affected by
non-adherence to the allocated regimen (those on
statins not taking them and those on placebo taking
statins). Thirdly, there is a paradox in that meta￾analyses of randomised trials showed that statins
reduced the incidence of strokes by about 30%,7–10 but
cohort studies showed no association between serum
cholesterol concentrations and stroke.11
Methods
We carried out three analyses. The first was a
meta-analysis of 164 short term (typically a few weeks)
randomised placebo controlled trials of six statins
(atorvastatin, fluvastatin, lovastatin, pravastatin, simvas￾tatin, and rosuvastatin (recently marketed)), used in
fixed dose.w1-w164 The meta-analysis examined the
efficacy of reducing total and LDL cholesterol by dose
and pretreatment serum cholesterol concentrations.
The second meta-analysis was of 58 randomised trials
(including eight of the above 164 trials) of reducing
serum cholesterol concentration by any means and
IHD events to estimate the reduction in risk by LDL
cholesterol reduction and duration of treatment. This
updates our 1994 analyses.6 12 13 In the third analysis we
examined data from nine cohort studies and the 58

randomised trials to determine the effect of a decrease
in LDL cholesterol concentration on thromboembolic,
haemorrhagic, fatal, and non-fatal stroke.
164 short term trials of statins and LDL cholesterol
reduction
We searched Medline, Cochrane Collaboration, and
Web of Science databases (see www.smd.qmul.ac.uk/
wolfson/bpchol for details and webextra for full list of
referencesw1-w164). We included all double blind trials,
irrespective of participants’ age or disease. Participants
in most trials were healthy with above average lipid
concentrations. In some trials they had high blood
pressure, diabetes, or IHD. We excluded trials that had
no placebo group, lasted less than two weeks, used
variable doses (titrating), or used cholesterol lowering
drugs in combination, and trials in which the order of
treatment and placebo periods in crossover trials was
not randomised or patients had chronic renal failure
or organ transplantation.
We defined drug efficacy as the reduction in LDL
cholesterol concentration for a given dose, expressed
as the change in the treated group minus that in the
placebo group (in crossover trials end treatment minus
end placebo concentration). Methods for calculating
standard errors and the statistical analyses are
described in the accompanying paper.14
58 randomised trials of serum cholesterol
reduction (by any means) and IHD events
We expanded the literature search to include methods
of reduction of serum cholesterol concentrations other
than statins; 33 more recent trials and 25 reported in
19946 met inclusion criteria. We excluded trials in
which risk factors other than lipids were changed, LDL
cholesterol reduction was < 0.2 mmol/l, fewer than
five IHD events were recorded, or there was no
untreated control group. We calculated the absolute
change in serum LDL cholesterol concentration in the
treatment group minus that in the placebo group. In
17 of the 25 earlier trials LDL cholesterol was not
measured so we used total serum cholesterol
concentration. We defined IHD events as IHD death or
non-fatal myocardial infarction, ignoring subsequent
events in an individual and excluding “silent” infarcts.
In each trial we determined the numbers of IHD events
and the changes in LDL cholesterol (adjusted for pla￾cebo) separately for years one, two, three to five, and six
or more after trial entry. We recorded disease events
and the average reduction in LDL cholesterol concen￾tration in all randomised participants regardless of
compliance (assuming LDL concentration reverted to
baseline when participants left the trial).
We combined the odds ratios (treated/placebo) of
disease events, stratified according to duration of
scheduled treatment, to yield summary estimates using
a random effects model.15 After the effects of reduction
in LDL cholesterol and duration of treatment were
taken into account there was no significant residual
heterogeneity. We standardised each trial result to an
LDL cholesterol reduction of 1.0 mmol/l by raising the
observed odds ratio to the power of (1.0 divided by the
observed LDL cholesterol reduction).
Nine cohort studies and 58 randomised trials of
serum cholesterol and stroke
We identified nine cohort studies of serum cholesterol
concentration and stroke that distinguished thrombo￾embolic and haemorrhagic strokes using computed
tomography or postmortem findings. We used Medline
(1980 to October 2002; key and text words blood chol￾esterol and [cerebral haemorrhage or intracranial
haemorrhages or subarachnoid haemorrhage or
cerebral infarction]). We determined the difference in
incidence for a difference in LDL cholesterol of 1.0
mmol/l adjusted for regression and surrogate dilution
bias.12 Data on stroke from the 58 randomised trials
were combined by using a random effects model.15
There was no significant heterogeneity.

Results
164 short term trials of statins and LDL cholesterol
reduction
Table 1 shows details of the 164 trials. There were
about 24 000 treated and 14 000 placebo participants
(individual trial data on can be found on
www.smd.qmul.ac.uk/wolfson/bpchol).
Figure 1 shows the dose-response relations for the
five statins across the doses tested (2.5-80 mg/day). The
straight lines fit the data well. With simvastatin the lin￾ear trend is unconvincing above 20 mg/day, but one
study (excluded from our meta-analysis because it had
no placebo group) confirmed greater efficacy at higher
doses.16
Table 2 shows the estimated reductions in LDL chol￾esterol, according to statin and dose, calculated from the
straight lines and standardised to the average pretreat￾ment LDL cholesterol concentration in these trials (4.8
mmol/l; about the average in people having an IHD
event). Rosuvastatin 5 mg/day, atorvastatin 10 mg/day,
and lovastatin or simvastatin 40 mg/day reduced LDL
cholesterol concentrations by about 35% (1.8 mmol/l),
but fluvastatin and pravastatin produced smaller
reductions even at the highest doses tested (80 mg/day).
Rosuvastatin 10 mg/day, atorvastatin 20 mg/day, and
lovastatin or simvastatin 80 mg/day reduced concentra￾tions by about 45% (2.1 mmol/l) and rosuvastatin
80 mg/day by about 60% (2.8 mmol/l).
Statins significantly lowered LDL cholesterol from
all pretreatment concentrations. The absolute reduc￾tions (in mmol/l) were greater in those with higher
pretreatment concentrations. The percentage reduc￾tions were independent of pretreatment concentra￾tions and therefore more generalisable, but we adopted
absolute reductions because the relations with disease
events were quantified by using absolute cholesterol
reductions.6 If the pretreatment concentration was
1 mmol/l higher (5.8 mmol/l), LDL cholesterol reduc￾tion was on average 0.28 mmol/l greater. No effect of
age was apparent, but there was little variation in aver￾age age across trials.
In these 164 trials atorvastatin and rosuvastatin
were taken in the morning but the other statins in
the evening. In four randomised comparisons in three
trialsw77 w137 w153 the average reduction was 0.20 mmol/l
smaller with morning dose than with evening dose
(95% confidence interval 0.05 mmol/l to 0.44 mmol/l
smaller). Doubling the dose has a similar effect (about
0.20 mmol/l) and so would counter this. The greater
effect of evening dose arises because of short biological
half life (peak cholesterol synthesis occurs at night).
Atorvastatin and rosuvastatin have longer half lives
and avoid this problem; lipid changes with atorvastatin
were similar with morning and evening dose.17
The reductions in total and LDL cholesterol
concentrations were highly correlated across trials
(r=0.83). On average, a reduction in LDL cholesterol of
1.0 mmol/l was associated with a total cholesterol
reduction of 1.20 mmol/l (1.10 mmol/l to 1.31 mmol/
l). If only total serum cholesterol reduction were
measured, we would expect the absolute reduction in
LDL cholesterol to be 17% less (1.0 minus 1.0/1.20).
The reduction in VLDL cholesterol was on average
10% of the reduction in LDL cholesterol shown in
table 2. Statins increased HDL cholesterol by 0.07
mmol/l (0.06 mmol/l to 0.08 mmol/l) on average, with
no detectable effect of dose.
58 trials of serum cholesterol reduction and IHD
events
These 58 trials included 76 359 participants allocated
treatment and 71 962 controls, with 5440 and 7102
IHD events respectively: 52% of participants had
known vascular disease on entry. See webextra tables A
and B for details.
Table 3 shows the reduction in IHD events by dura￾tion of treatment; each trial result is standardised to a
reduction in LDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/l (about the
average reduction in the trials). In the first year the
reduction was 11%, in the second 24%, and in the first
and second years combined 13%. Data from 12 trials
with event numbers published for the first two years
but not the first and second years separately yielded a
similar result. The reduction in the third, fourth, and
fifth years combined was 33%, and the sixth and subse￾quent years was 36%. After standardisation for
reduction in LDL cholesterol and duration of
treatment, risk reduction was similar for fatal and non￾fatal IHD events, for different methods of reducing
serum cholesterol (fibrates, resins, niacin, statins, or
dietary change), and in participants with and without
known IHD on entry (showing that the proportional
risk reduction model applies regardless of initial risk).

Table 4 shows the combined effect of duration of
treatment and reduction in LDL cholesterol directly.
The trials tend to cluster into three groups, with mean
reductions of LDL cholesterol of 0.5 mmol/l (n=21),
1.0 mmol/l (n=24), and 1.6 mmol/l (n=5). Across these
groups, the greater the reduction in LDL cholesterol
the greater the reduction in IHD events. With a reduc￾tion in LDL cholesterol of around 1.6 mmol/l the
reduction in IHD events after two or more years’ treat￾ment was 51%.
Serum cholesterol and stroke
Nine cohort studies
Figure 2 shows the relative risk of thromboembolic and
haemorrhagic stroke for a 1.0 mmol/l decrease in LDL
cholesterol concentration from each of the nine cohort
studies that distinguished the two. Overall there was a
15% (6% to 21%) decrease in thromboembolic stroke
(P < 0.001) and a 19% (10% to 29%) increase in haem￾orrhagic stroke (P < 0.001). The similar relative risk
estimates for subarachnoid (1.16) and intracerebral
haemorrhage (1.22) justify combining them as “haem￾orrhagic stroke.”
The opposing effects of thromboembolic and
haemorrhagic stroke explain the absence of an associ￾ation between serum cholesterol and stroke in a meta￾analysis of 45 cohort studies.11 Death from the two
types of stroke cancelled each other because the 45
cohort studies generally recorded only fatal stroke and
at age 60 (the average in the studies) about half of fatal
strokes are thromboembolic and half are haemor￾rhagic.18 w210-w214 These data also show that at age 60,
76% of non-fatal strokes are thromboembolic and 24%
haemorrhagic, and 71% of all strokes are thromboem￾bolic and 29% haemorrhagic18 (the difference from
fatal stroke explained by the greater chance of dying
from a haemorrhagic stroke). Application of the
change in risk for type of stroke to these percentages
yields an expected decrease in non-fatal stroke (per 1
mmol/l reduction in LDL cholesterol) of 7% (a 15%
decrease in 76% plus a 19% increase in 24%). Similarly
the expected decrease for all stroke is 6%.

non-fatal strokes (in 10 none occurred) (see webextra
tables A and B for details).
Table 5 shows the main results on stroke from ran￾domised trials and the above expected results from the
nine cohort studies, standardised to an LDL choles￾terol reduction of 1.0 mmol/l. Stroke risk in all the
trials was reduced by 20% on average (P < 0.001), but
this varied. In people without known vascular disease
the reduction was the same ( − 6%)as that expected
from cohort studies, but in people with known vascular
disease it was higher ( − 22% v − 6%; P < 0.001). This
difference probably arises because thromboembolic
stroke is common in people with vascular disease so
more of their strokes will be thromboembolic. Results
from the six randomised trials in people with known
vascular disease that distinguished the two types of
stroke confirmed this: 91% of the strokes in the
placebo groups were thromboembolic (700/773) and
9% haemorrhagic, whereas in the stroke registry stud￾ies in people the same age without known vascular dis￾ease 71% of strokes were thromboembolic and 29%
haemorrhagic.w210-w214 Reduction in LDL cholesterol
concentration prevents thromboembolic but not
haemorrhagic strokes, accounting for the greater than
expected effect of treatment in people with vascular
disease. This also explains the greater than expected
reduction in non-fatal stroke in shown table 5 ( − 23% v
− 7%; P < 0.001) as most non-fatal strokes are
thromboembolic. The absence of a material reduction
in fatal stroke in the trials corroborates the cohort
study observations.
The 20% reduction in stroke for a 1.0 mmol/l
reduction in LDL cholesterol concentration is there￾fore specific to these trial populations in which 80% of
all strokes were in people with known vascular disease.
In the general population, stroke registry data indicate
that about 25% of first strokes are in people with
known vascular disease.w217-w219 Therefore a reduction of
1.0 mmol/l in LDL cholesterol would reduce stroke in
the general population by 10% (25% of the 22% reduc￾tion in people with known vascular disease and 75% of
the 6% reduction in people without known vascular
disease, from table 5).
Three large trials showed little or no reduction
in incidence of stroke until the second year, as for
IHD.w165 w184-w187 The reductions in all stroke, thrombo￾embolic stroke, and non-fatal stroke shown in table 5
would, therefore, be greater if events occurring in the
first 1-2 years were excluded.
Adverse effects
Forty eight of the 164 trials of statins and LDL choles￾terol reported the number of participants with one or
more symptoms possibly caused by the drug
(1063/14197 allocated to statins and 923/10568
allocated to placebo). Meta-analysis of these data
showed no excess risk in people allocated to statins. On
average 1% fewer treated patients than placebo
patients reported symptoms (95% confidence interval
3% fewer to 1% more in treated patients). The
prevalence of each of 12 specific symptoms, including
muscle pain and various gastrointestinal symptoms,
was similar in treated and placebo patients, even for the
highest daily dose tested (80 mg for all six statins). The
upper confidence limits excluded the possibility that
statins caused any symptom in more than 2% of treated
patients.
The only known serious adverse effects of statins
are rhabdomyolysis and liver failure from hepatitis.
The absolute risks are low. In the trials of statins and
adverse events, with about 35 000 people and 158 000
person years of observation in both treated and
placebo groups (see webextra table A), rhabdomyolosis
was diagnosed (variable criteria) in eight treated and
five placebo patients, none with serious illness or death.
Raised serum creatine kinase activity ( ≥ 10 times the
“upper limit of normal,” used to recognise rhabdomy￾olysis) was reported in 55 treated patients (0.17%) and
43 placebo patients (0.13%); muscle symptoms were
present in 13 and 4 respectively. From the first market￾ing of statins in 1987 to May 2001 the Food and Drug
Administration recorded 42 deaths from rhabdomy￾olysis attributable to statins (other than cerivastatin,
which was not used in these trials) in the United
States,19 a rate of one per 10 million prescriptions dis￾pensed19 or (as a prescription is typically for one
month’s supply20) about one per million person years
of use. There were no cases of liver failure in the trials.
Raised alanine aminotransferase activity ( ≥ 3 times the
upper limit of normal, used to recognise hepatitis) was
reported in 449 treated (1.3%) and 383 placebo
patients (1.1%) (see webextra table A). From 1987 to
May 2000 the Food and Drug Administration recorded
30 cases of liver failure attributable to statins,21 again
about one per million person years of use.

Concern over hazards from serum cholesterol
reduction was resolved by earlier studies.9 13 Data from
the 58 randomised trials of cholesterol reduction and
disease events confirm this. The odds ratios (treated/
placebo) for a 1.0 mmol/l decrease in serum
cholesterol were 0.87 (0.73 to 1.03; 675 deaths) for cir￾culatory diseases other than IHD and stroke, 1.06 (0.96
to 1.16; 2293 deaths) for cancer, 0.94 (0.72 to 1.23; 324
deaths) for injuries and suicide, and 0.88 (0.78 to 1.01;
1363 deaths) for diseases other than circulatory
diseases and cancer.
Discussion
Randomised trials show directly that a reduction in
LDL cholesterol of 1.6 mmol/l halves the risk of IHD
events after two years and that this reduction can be
achieved with low doses of some statins (for example,
simvastatin 20 mg/day, table 2). Certain statins achieve
larger reductions (for example, 2.6 mmol/l with atorv￾astatin 80 mg/day and 2.8 mmol/l with rosuvastatin 80
mg/day), which would lead to greater reductions in
IHD events, but the corresponding risk reduction can￾not be quantified directly from randomised trials as no
trial achieved so large a reduction. This can be
determined from cohort studies of cholesterol and
IHD if cohort studies accurately predicted trial results.
Table 6 shows the reduction in IHD events in the
trials after the exclusion of data from the first two years
and those expected from cohort study results.6
Observed trial and expected cohort study results are
close, showing that cohort study data can be used to
predict risk reduction from lowering LDL cholesterol.
The similarity between trial and cohort study data, and
the similar reductions in risk (given cholesterol reduc￾tion) with different methods of lowering cholesterol,
indicate that the reduction in risk is directly
attributable to cholesterol reduction; there is no need
to invoke other actions of drugs.
Table 7 shows the reductions in IHD events at
different ages predicted from the cohort studies.6 At
age 60 years a 2.2 mmol/l reduction in serum LDL
cholesterol concentration (attainable by using atorva￾statin 40 mg/day, lovastatin 80 mg/day, or rosuvastatin
20 mg/day) would reduce the risk of IHD by nearly
70%. However, adverse effects are also dose related,19
and rosuvastatin is relatively untested. As moderate
doses of statins substantially reduce the risk of IHD
events it may be prudent to select commonly used
doses of the older drugs for general use. This would
also be cheaper, as simvastatin comes off patent in
2003 and lovastatin is already off patent. At doses of 40
mg/day these drugs lower LDL cholesterol by 1.8
mmol/l, which can reduce IHD events at age 60 years
by 61% (51% to 71%). This is about double the
currently recognised preventive effect of 30%.1–3
Reasons for underestimation of effect on IHD
Why are the current estimates of effect so low? Firstly,
five of the seven largest statin trials used pravastatin,
which is relatively less effective (table 2). Secondly, risk
falls relatively little within the first two years, and inclu￾sion of these early events underestimates the
preventive effect. Thirdly, a particular problem for the
statin trials was the extent to which the intention to
treat analysis underestimated the true preventive phar￾macological effect because of non-adherence to the
protocol (treated patients not taking their tablets and
placebo patients taking statins). This last problem was
partially overcome by relating the reduction in disease
events to the average LDL cholesterol reduction in all
randomised participants (treated and placebo). In this
way non-adherence to the protocol was reflected in
both a smaller than expected difference in LDL
cholesterol concentration and a smaller than expected
difference in the number of IHD events between the
two groups. While this yields an accurate estimate of
the risk reduction for the observed difference in LDL
cholesterol it underestimates the effect of a given dose
of the statin.
Effects of LDL cholesterol reduction on stroke
The estimated overall reduction in stroke of 10% (rela￾tive risk 0.90) for a 1.0 mmol/l reduction in LDL chol￾esterol is equivalent to a 17% (9% to 25%) reduction in
stroke for a 1.8 mmol/l reduction LDL cholesterol,
readily achievable with a statin (as 0.901.8/1 = relative risk
of 0.83). In people with existing vascular disease the
reduction is 36% (0.781.8 = 0.64) The interpretation of
the cohort study result showing a higher incidence of
haemorrhagic stroke for a lower LDL cholesterol con￾centration is uncertain. Too few haemorrhagic strokes
were identified in the randomised trials to resolve the

uncertainty. An increased risk cannot be excluded, but
this should not preclude the use of statins in the
prevention of cardiovascular disease.
Conclusions
Statins can reduce IHD events by an estimated 61%.
They reduce stroke by 17%, preventing non-fatal
strokes with little effect on the risk of fatal stroke. Any
possible excess of haemorrhagic stroke is greatly
outweighed by the protective effect against IHD events
and thromboembolic stroke.

What is already known on this topic
Statins lower LDL cholesterol, but the size of the
reduction according to statin and dose is uncertain
Statins prevent heart disease, but meta-analyses of
randomised trials have underestimated their effect
The effect of statins on risk of stroke is uncertain
What this study adds
Simvastatin 40 mg/day, lovastatin 40 mg/day, and
atorvastatin 10 mg/day lower LDL cholesterol by
about 37% from all pretreatment concentrations
These interventions reduce the risk of ischaemic
heart disease events at age 60 by an estimated 61%
in the long term, with little reduction in the first
year but a 51% reduction by the third year
The interventions reduce the overall risk of stroke
by 17%, preventing thromboembolic but not
haemorrhagic stroke
