Pirfenidone (PFD) is the first and only clinically used 
antifibrotic drug for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary 
fibrosis (IPF). This study evaluated the antifibrotic effects of 
two metabolites of PFD, 5-hydroxypirfenidone (PFD-OH) and 
5-carboxypirfenidone (PFD-COOH), on WI-38 cells in an in 
vitro lung fibroblast model. The inhibitory effects of PFD-OH 
and PFD-COOH on transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1)-
induced collagen synthesis in WI-38 cells were evaluated by 
measuring intracellular hydroxyproline, a major component 
of the protein collagen. PFD-OH and PFD-COOH at 300 and 
1000 µM concentrations significantly decreased the TGF-β1-
induced hydroxyproline content in WI-38 cells. These results 
indicate that PFD-OH and PFD-COOH have antifibrotic 
activities, which inhibit collagen synthesis in fibroblasts. This 
study suggests that the concentrations of PFD and its metabo￾lites should be considered in clinical therapy for IPF.

Fibrotic diseases occur in various tissue regions and can 
resemble scar tissue when they form in inappropriate loca￾tions such as lung, liver, heart, eye, and kidney. In particular, 
idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is devastating with an 
extremely low five-year survival rate (<50%).1) Currently, re￾searchers are working to develop an antifibrotic drug that will 
improve the survival rate of patient with IPF.
Pirfenidone (PFD, Fig. 1), 5-methyl-1-phenyl-2-(1H)-pyri￾done, is the first and only clinically used antifibrotic drug for 
the treatment of IPF in Japan (Pirespa®), Europe (Esbriet®), 
and India (Pirfenex®).2) PFD has antifibrotic, anti-inflamma￾tory, and antioxidative actions.2,3) In experimental animal 
models, PFD has demonstrated an antifibrotic effect in several 
tissues, such as lung, liver, and kidney.4–6) To date, clinical 
studies that have evaluated the PFD pharmacokinetics have 
been conducted in patients with IPF. After oral administration 
of PFD in humans, it is rapidly eliminated from plasma.7,8)
Other researchers have shown that PFD is rapidly metabolized 
to 5-hydroxypirfenidone (PFD-OH) and 5-carboxypirfenidone 
(PFD-COOH) (Fig. 1), and the major metabolite PFD-COOH 
is eliminated in the urine (>87%).9) However, the antifibrotic 
effects of PFD-OH and PFD-COOH have not been reported. 
In the present study, we discussed the possible involvement of 
pirfenidone metabolites in the antifibrotic action of a therapy 
for IPF.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Materials and Animals PFD was purchased from Tokyo 
Chemical Industry Co., Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan). PFD-OH and 
PFD-COOH were purchased from Toronto Research Chemi￾cals Inc. (North York, ON, Canada). TGF-β1 was purchased 
from Peprotech Inc. (Rocky Hill, NJ, U.S.A.). All other re￾agents were commercially available and of analytical grade. 
Male SD rats, 8 weeks of age and 230–270 g body weight, 
were purchased from CLEA Japan, Inc. (Tokyo, Japan). The 
care and use of animals followed “The Guidelines for the 
Care and Use of Animals” approved by Ohu University in ac￾cordance with the principles of the NIH guidelines (Approval 
number: 2012–50).
Antifibrotic Experiments in Vitro WI-38 cells (Riken 
Gene Bank, Tsukuba, Japan), a human lung fibroblast cell 
line, were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium 
(DMEM) containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum 
(FBS) and 40 µg/mL gentamicin in a humidified atmosphere 
of 5% CO2 at 37°C. Cells from passage numbers 12–13 were 
seeded (2.0×104
 cells/well) on 24-well culture plates. At con￾fluence, the medium was replaced with DMEM containing 
0.4% FBS and 50 µg/mL of ascorbate. After a 24-h incubation, 
transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 (10 ng/mL) and serial 
concentrations of PFD, PFD-OH, and PFD-COOH were added 
to the WI-38 cells, and subsequently the cells were incubated 
at 5% CO2 at 37°C for 24 h. After incubation, the medium was 
removed by aspiration and washed twice with ice-cold phos￾phate buffered saline (PBS). The cells were then extracted 
with 300 µL of 2 M NaCl, and the concentration of hydroxypro￾line in the cell extracts was measured by HPLC as described 
below. The DNA concentration in the cell extracts was de￾termined using Fluorescent DNA Quantitation Kit (Bio-Rad, 
Hercules, CA, U.S.A.).
Pharmacokinetics Experiment in Vivo PFD dissolved 
in PBS was intravenously administered to rats at a dose of 
30 mg/kg and the dosage volume was 1 mL/kg. At each desig-

nated time point, rats were anesthetized using intraperitoneal 
injections of pentobarbital sodium at a dose of 40 mg/kg and 
blood was collected from the jugular vein. The concentration 
of PFD and its metabolites was measured in each sample by 
HPLC as described below. The pharmacokinetic analysis was 
performed using the non-compartment analytical method.10)
Determination of Hydroxyproline by HPLC The con￾centrations of hydroxyproline in samples were measured by 
HPLC following fluorescent derivatization, using the method 
of Hutson et al.11) The derivative in samples was subjected 
to HPLC using a system (Jasco Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) 
involving an InertSustain C18 (3.0×250 mm internal diameter; 
GL Sciences, Inc., Torrance, CA, U.S.A.). The mobile phase 
was 85 mM acetic buffer (pH 4.3)–acetonitrile (68 : 32). Separa￾tion was performed at a flow rate of 0.4 mL/min at 45°C, and 
the eluate from the column was monitored by fluorescence 
detection (excitation wavelength of 250 nm and emission 
wavelength of 310 nm).
Determination of PFD and Its Metabolites by HPLC 
The concentrations of PFD, PFD-OH, and PFD-COOH 
in plasma were measured by HPLC, using the method by 
Wang et al.12) The prepared samples were subjected to HPLC 
using a system involving a Mightysil RP-18GPII column 
(3.0×250 mm, Kanto Chemical Co., Tokyo, Japan). The mobile 
phase was 0.2% acetic acid/methanol (74 : 26). The separation 
was performed at a flow rate of 0.4 mL/min at 45°C and the 
column was monitored by UV absorbance detection (absor￾bance wavelength of 310 nm).
Statistics Statistical analysis was performed using the 
Dunnett’s t-test and SPSS software version 21 (IBM Inc., Ar￾monk, NY, U.S.A.).
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The present study evaluated the antifibrotic effects of the 
PFD metabolites PFD-OH and PFD-COOH. The effects of 
different concentrations of PFD, PFD-OH, and PFD-COOH 
on hydroxyproline content, a major component of the protein 
collagen, in WI-38 cells, a human lung fibroblast cell line, are 
shown in Fig. 2. PFD at 100 µM (18.5 µg/mL), 300 µM (55.6 µg/
mL), and 1000 µM (185 µg/mL), and PFD-OH at 300 µM
(60.4 µg/mL) and 1000 µM (201 µg/mL), and PFD-COOH at 
300 µM (64.6 µg/mL) and 1000 µM (215 µg/mL) significantly 
decreased the TGF-β1-induced hydroxyproline content in 
WI-38 cells without cellular toxicity. PFD and its metabolites 
were stable at 37°C in medium for 24 h (data not shown). 
These results indicate that PFD-OH and PFD-COOH have 
antifibrotic activities, which inhibit collagen synthesis in lung 
fibroblasts. In addition, after intravenous administration of 
PFD to rats, the PFD-COOH concentration in plasma was 
comparable to that of PFD (Fig. 3). The calculated terminal 
elimination half-life (T1/2) of PFD, PFD-OH, and PFD-COOH 
were 0.74± 0.12, 0.79± 0.26, and 0.84± 0.26 h, respectively. The 
areas under the concentration–time curves (AUC) for PFD, 
PFD-OH, and PFD-COOH were 30.5, 3.9, and 24.2 µg*h/mL, 
respectively. These results indicate that the antifibrotic effect 
because of the presence of PFD-COOH in plasma cannot be 
neglected. The plasma concentrations of both PFD and PFD￾COOH were lower than effective concentrations of those in 
vitro. We reasoned that PFD can possibly exert antifibrotic 
effect in synergy with PFD-COOH in vivo. Recently, Huang 
et al. have reported that PFD-COOH concentration in plasma 
was approximately 60% of PFD concentration in plasma after 
oral administration to human.9) Thus, it is thought that PFD￾COOH may participate in the antifibrotic effects of PFD in 
the treatment of IPF. On the other hands, PFD-OH pharmaco￾kinetics in human are not well understood. The involvement 
of PFD-OH in the antifibrotic action of a therapy for IPF in 
human is thought to need examination in both pharmacody￾namics and pharmacokinetics in human.
PFD has many mechanisms of pharmacological action. 
PFD has been shown to reduce collagen I expression,13) block 
the proliferative effects of platelet-derived growth factor 
(PDGF),14) and inhibit the expression of heat shock protein 
(HSP) 47 on lung fibroblasts.13) In this study, the inhibition of 
collagen synthesis by PFD-OH and PFD-COOH were weaker 
than that of the parent compound (Fig. 3). Since many mecha￾nisms contribute to fibrosis,13–15) the pharmacological effects

may differ in the mechanisms of PFD and its metabolites. 
Final stage in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), deposition 
of the excessive extracellular matrix (collagen) occurs via
multiple pathways such as tissue injury, various mediators 
activation, and chemokine imbalance.16) Therefore, we evalu￾ated first the inhibitory effects on the collagen synthesis of 
PFD and its metabolites. Further studies in lung fibroblasts are 
warranted to determine the contribution of PDGF and HSP47 
expression in the antifibrotic effects of PFD-OH and PFD￾COOH.
CONCLUSION
PFD-COOH, a main metabolite of PFD, reduced the hy￾droxyproline content in lung fibroblasts, which resulted in 
reduced collagen synthesis in lung fibrosis. This study sug￾gests that not only the concentration of PFD but also that of 
its metabolite should be considered in clinical therapy of IPF.
