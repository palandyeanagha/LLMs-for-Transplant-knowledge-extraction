Abstract
Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is a systemic autoimmune disease with a complex spectrum of cellular and molecular
characteristics including several dramatic changes in the populations of peripheral leukocytes. These changes include
general leukopenia, activation of B and T cells, and maturation of granulocytes. The manifestation of SLE in peripheral blood
is central to the disease but is incompletely understood. A technique for rigorously characterizing changes in mixed
populations of cells, microarray expression deconvolution, has been applied to several areas of biology but not to SLE or to
blood. Here we demonstrate that microarray expression deconvolution accurately quantifies the constituents of real blood
samples and mixtures of immune-derived cell lines. We characterize a broad spectrum of peripheral leukocyte cell types and
states in SLE to uncover novel patterns including: specific activation of NK and T helper lymphocytes, relationships of these
patterns to each other, and correlations to clinical variables and measures. The expansion and activation of monocytes, NK
cells, and T helper cells in SLE at least partly underlie this disease’s prominent interferon signature. These and other patterns
of leukocyte dynamics uncovered here correlate with disease severity and treatment, suggest potential new treatments, and
extend our understanding of lupus pathology as a complex autoimmune disease involving many arms of the immune
system.

Introduction
Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is a systemic autoimmune
disease marked by inflammation and tissue damage in multiple
organs. Numerous cellular abnormalities have been identified in
SLE, including lymphopenia [1], differentiation of dendritic cells
[2], and reduced presence of macrophages [3]. Additionally, there
are numerous known molecular changes, including increased
abundance of TRAIL (Entrez Gene ID 8743) [4], a type I
interferon signature[2,5,6] and a granulopoeisis signature [6].
Genes affecting risk of developing SLE include IRF5 (Entrez Gene
ID 3663), an interferon responsive gene[7,8] and STAT4 (Entrez
Gene ID 6775), a regulator of T-helper 1 cells [9], suggesting that
the regulation of differentiation and activation of immune cell
subsets is a fundamental component of the disease. All of these
cellular, molecular and genetic factors play roles in the disease, but
their relative contributions to disease onset and progression are not
yet understood. Characterization of the dynamics of SLE at the
cellular and molecular level is ongoing and promises to provide
insight into the etiology of the disease.
The capability of gene expression microarrays to simultaneously
measure essentially all human genes has made possible a variety of
approaches to analyzing biological samples [10]. A simple approach
is to measure the statistical significance of differentially expressed
genes between two groups of samples studied (i.e. patients and
controls). This supervised analysis presumes that any meaningful
differences are between the predetermined groups of samples. An
unsupervised analysis uses no prior knowledge about how the samples
are related. As an example, global hierarchical clustering was used to
discover the interferon signature in the blood of some but not all SLE
patients [2,5,6]. Closer integration of biological knowledge of genes
with the analysis of expression data can enable more detailed
examination of the patient samples. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis
(GSEA) is a knowledge-based method to identify genes differentially
expressed that share common biological functions or are in the same
biochemical pathways [11]. This type of analysis with sets of genes
that are specifically expressed in different immune cell subsets[12] can
be used to identify the presence of these subsets in disease blood or
tissue (data not shown). However, the results are only qualitative, and
systematic analysis of relative proportions or activation states of these
subsets is not possible by this method.
Microarray expression deconvolution, however, can quantify
proportions of cells in a complex tissue. The object of deconvolu￾tion is to find the solution of a convolution equation of the form:
AX~B
In this case, B is the microarray data from one complex biological
sample, X is the set of unknown proportions of the cellular
PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 July 2009 | Volume 4 | Issue 7 | e6098

constituents of B, and A is the known matrix of expression levels of
the genes in all the cellular constituents of B, which is convolved
with X. This matrix equation incorporates gene expression
signatures representing cell types (e.g. white blood cells) so it
may be solved using standard linear least-squares fitting for X,
which is the relative amounts of those cells in the mixture of
interest B (e.g. a white blood cell sample). Lu et al. [13] pioneered
the application of this technique to microarray data by quantifying
the proportions of cells in different phases of the cell cycle in yeast
cultures. The deconvolution based on synchronized populations of
yeast cells at specific points of the cell cycle predicted the phases
occupied by different cell cycle mutants. In another application,
Wang et al. [14] analyzed mouse mammary tissue and used the
residuals of their fit to separate the differential expression due to
changes in tissue composition from those due to intrinsic gene
regulation. In both these studies expression signatures of
homogeneous samples of cells (i.e. prior biological knowledge)
enabled the interpretation of the cellular composition of a complex
tissue.
A biological sample from a patient with an autoimmune disease
typically contains various different immune cell subsets, and the
process of microarray deconvolution can quantify their relative
proportions. Essentially, the expression of each gene in the sample
is modeled as a linear combination of the expression of that gene
in each of the cells comprising that sample. If the expression
signature of each immune cell subset is known, then the fractions
of each subset in the sample can be determined by solving a linear
equation to best fit the fractions of cell subsets to the whole
sample’s expression signature.
This first step of experimentally determining the signatures of
the constituent parts is critical because it defines the framework of
the results of deconvolution. The different cell types present in
blood can be purified in order to construct expression signatures to
use as bases for analysis. We have previously reported the
purification and microarray analysis of a large collection of white
blood cells (Immune Response In Silico, or ‘‘IRIS’’) [12]. These
data include expression of genes in different activation and
differentiation states that represent a spectrum of cell species
present in blood, providing a basis set for microarray deconvolu￾tion of blood samples. Here we test fifteen cell subsets including
several resting and activated dyads. Some are not readily
distinguishable based on surface markers alone. Moreover, it
should be possible to distinguish even greater numbers of cell types
by deconvolution.
The expression signatures in blood samples from SLE patients
show significant, specific differences from those of healthy controls
[6,15]. Some of these differences are changes in the abundance of
specific leukocyte populations [16,17], suggesting that systematic
large-scale characterization of the cellular composition of SLE
patient blood would measure quantitative differences relevant to
the disease pathophysiology. Here we use microarray deconvolu￾tion to explore immune cell subsets and activation states in SLE
patient blood. First, we measure the accuracy of the method with a
‘‘truth’’ experiment where known proportions of immune cells are
mixed, assayed on expression microarrays, and computationally
separated. Next, we performed a proof of concept experiment by
deconvolving white blood cell profiles into a modest number of
immune cell subsets. We then use this validated method to derive
immune cell signatures for a panel of eighteen major populations
and states of white blood cells. Finally, we deconvolve expression
profiles of blood samples from healthy donors and SLE patients
into the proportions of these different white blood cell subsets and
identify patterns in their dynamics related to disease and
treatment.
Results
Establishment and characterization of the deconvolution
process
The process of deconvolving mixtures of cells was developed
using a system of four transformed cell lines of immune origin:
Raji, IM-9 (both from B cells), Jurkat (from T cells), and THP-1
(from monocyte) cells. These cell lines provided the abundant
sources of pure cells necessary to support experimental mixing of
different types of cells in several different ratios. These cell lines are
useful because they show similar but distinguishable expression
profiles; their immune derivation is not important to the purpose
of the experiment. We chose two B cell lines to gauge the ability of
the assay to discriminate between cells that are very similar to each
other. The algorithm was trained and the performance limits of
deconvolution were measured by creating various mixtures of cells,
assaying the pure cells and the cell mixtures on expression
microarrays, and using the expression data from the pure cells to
deconvolve the expression data from the cell mixtures.
Data for many probesets in a given expression microarray
dataset are comprised of noise but little or no biological signal.
Here we show that reducing the contribution of these noise￾dominant probesets to deconvolution improves performance, and
we establish an approach for weighting probesets to define a high￾performance basis matrix for performing deconvolution. Probesets
were ranked by their degree of differential expression as described
in the Methods section, and a thorough set of matrices comprised
of different quantities of the most differentially-expressed probesets
was tested in deconvolution by comparing the results of each
matrix to the known mixture ratios. Both small and very large
matrices performed poorly. The distribution of matrix size to the
least squares fit to the data was continuous and exhibited a gently
rounded optimum at 275 probesets. We observed that goodness of
fit correlated very closely with how well conditioned (i.e. condition
number) each matrix was. Condition number is a scale-free
empirical property of a matrix and a high-fidelity marker for the
ability of a basis matrix to accurately deconvolve a mixture.
Therefore, subsequent basis matrices were defined by weighting
probesets to maximize conditioning.
Hierarchical clustering of the basis data revealed similar
expression signatures within each cell line and very different
expression signatures between the cell lines (Figure 1A). These
characteristics are not surprising since the approach to defining the
basis matrix was designed to maximize them, but it does confirm
that there are hundreds of expression profiles that are individually
somewhat noisy but together differentiate cell types, and it suggests
that mixtures of the cell lines could be deconvolved.
Mixtures of the cell lines were created in defined proportions in
triplicate, and each mixture sample was assayed on expression
microarrays and computationally deconvolved into its ingredient
cell lines. Comparing the resulting predicted proportions to the
actual proportions (Figure 1B) showed that the precision of the
deconvolution predictions (s.d. = 0.7860.52%) is sufficient to
discriminate immune cell subsets present in proportions below
1% in white blood cell samples. The accuracy of deconvolution
(bias = 2.461.4%) is comfortably within an acceptable limit of
10%. Neither precision nor accuracy correlated significantly with
the concentration of the particular component measured,
indicating that the major source of error is additive and not
multiplicative.
The variance between the replicates from each cell line was
relatively small (s.d. = 0.78%). The two B cell lines, IM-9 and Raji
cells, were found by deconvolution to exhibit gene expression
profiles that were relatively similar (0.96 mean correlation

coefficient). Results from deconvolution of these two cell lines were
precise (s.d. = 0.9960.66%) and accurate (bias = 0.2761.6%). The
difference between the expected and the predicted proportions of
B and T cell lines was less precise (average s.d. = 2.4%). It was
expected that T cell lines would be more difficult to predict
accurately in these test mixtures than B cell lines because the
quantities of T cell lines in the mixtures are lower. Surprisingly,
the magnitudes and directions of each cell type’s errors were not
consistent. So although there appears to be systematic error, it is
relatively small and not necessarily explained by the cell type.
This characterization of performance on a test data set designed
to simulate the challenges of deconvolving leukocytes provides
important knowledge of the capabilities of the method that guide
its application to whole blood.
Proof of concept: deconvolution accurately predicts
fractions of immune cells in blood
Next we analyzed blood samples of known composition with
several goals in mind: first, to test the method on data independent
from that used for training; second, to verify biological
applicability of deconvolution by testing performance on leuko￾cytes instead of transformed cell lines; and third, to assess whether
deconvolution of white blood cell microarray expression data from
healthy donors would correlate well with protein expression of
markers that identify immune cell subsets. As a preliminary study,
we deconvolved whole blood samples from healthy donors and
compared those results to Complete Blood Counts (CBC) with
differential of lymphocytes, granulocytes (Figure S1). Although the
results were excellent, the CBC data lacked any detailed immune
cell subsets to more thoroughly test the performance of
deconvolution. Therefore we performed an experiment to test
the deconvolution of cell types that are more similar to each other
than those in the preliminary CBC study (and more biologically
relevant than the pilot experiment that used mixtures of cell lines).
We purified naı¨ve, effector memory and central memory T cells
from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and compared
the quantification of the T cell subsets by expression microarray
deconvolution to their levels determined by cell sorting (FACS).
Hierarchical clustering of the basis expression data (Figure 2A)
illustrates the significant expression differences between the three￾subset groups, a necessary condition for the data to permit
deconvolution. Many of the genes represented are general markers
for T cells, like CD5 (Entrez Gene ID 921) and CD6 (Entrez Gene
ID 923). Others like PTK2 (Entrez Gene ID 5747) and SCML1
(Entrez Gene ID 6322) have significantly higher expression in
naı¨ve T cells, while CFHR1 (Entrez Gene ID 3078) and MEOX1
(Entrez Gene ID 4222) are examples of genes with higher
expression in central memory T cells. Expression deconvolution
yielded accurate estimates of the fractions of T cell subsets
determined by FACS counting (Figure 2B). These results varied
from the FACS data by a mean of 1.3%, illustrating that
deconvolution of expression microarray data accurately deter￾mines the levels of memory and naı¨ve subsets of T lymphocytes in
blood samples.
Figure 1. Expression deconvolution was characterized using mixtures of cell lines. (a) Two-dimensional hierarchical clustering of pure cell
line samples and the probesets used as bases in deconvolution show strong segregation of cell lines and clear patterns to support deconvolution. (b)
Plotting of proportions of cell lines determined from deconvolution vs. proportions of the cell lines actually mixed shows strong congruence (RMS
error = 0.028).

Identification of basis probesets to define immune cell
subset expression
The proof of concept experiment tested a relatively small
number of immune cell subsets. Many others are of interest in an
immune disease such as SLE. Microarray data from the immune
cell subsets of interest have been reported previously[12] and are
summarized in Table 1.
We selected probesets to use as the basis of discriminating
between cell types by screening for those that offered the most
significant differences between the several cells in which they were
most highly expressed. In order to optimize the number of markers
selected, we computed the condition number of matrices of all
sizes, from a handful of genes in one extreme, to the whole genome
in the other. We observed that the optimal set size was 360
probesets, and we used this set to distinguish between different
immune cell subsets and activation states in all subsequent analysis
of blood samples. Figure 3 shows some examples of these probesets
that discriminate between cell types and are used in deconvolu￾tion. Most of these exemplify markers that are relatively specific
for one or two cell types. The full collection of basis probesets and
their expression levels in all cell types and states are in Table S1.
We surveyed the distribution of these data by performing two￾dimensional hierarchical clustering and visualized the results as a
heatmap with distance-measure dendrograms (Figure S2), and
found that the cells all appeared to have distinct expression
signatures, to be separated reasonably well on the dendrogram,
and to cluster near other samples that we expected to have
relatively similar signatures. We examined quantitatively whether
the eighteen cell types that we profiled are sufficiently distinct to be
resolved by their expression signatures by performing singular
value decomposition (SVD) on the basis matrix and observing the
values of the diagonal matrix. This method would yield values at
the lower-right corner of the matrix near zero if some of the cells

were inadequately different from each other; reassuringly, here the
lowest value was 3702.301. Although this value is not considered
to be near zero and thus not worrisome, it does represent the
aspect of white blood cell biology that we had least successfully
resolved, so we explored which cells caused it. We noted that the
two memory B cell samples were the two samples that were most
similar to each other and we hypothesized that they alone might
be responsible for the low end of the SVD diagonal. When we
tested this by removing the IgM memory population from the basis
matrix and refactoring it we found that the diagonal very closely

resembled the previous diagonal but with the lowest value missing
(Figure S3), confirming that all the cells have been sufficiently
differentiated and that the two memory B cell populations are the
least differentiated.
The probesets in the basis set represent many genes that are
already known to be good markers for particular cell types and
states. For instance, well-known B cell markers like CD19 (Entrez
Gene ID 930) and MS4A1 (Entrez Gene ID 931) were observed to
provide the best discrimination for B cell levels, and CD3 genes
like CD3D (Entrez Gene ID 915) were among the best markers for
T cells. In some cases the most distinguishing markers were not the
classic markers used for cell sorting. For example, it was not
surprising that the immunoglobulin heavy chain mu constant
region is the most distinguishing marker in microarray data for
plasma cells circulating in the blood, but CKLFSF2 (Entrez Gene
ID 146225) expression emerged as a superior marker for
neutrophils and CLIC3 (Entrez Gene ID 9022) for NK cells.
Deconvolution of immune cells purified from whole
blood
Validity of deconvolution of whole blood using this large basis
set was assessed by experimenting with purified leukocyte samples
completely distinct from the samples and data used to build the
basis expression matrix. This separate microarray dataset from
CD4+ T cells, CD19+ B cells, CD56+ NK cells, CD14+
monocytes, and neutrophils purified from different donors were
deconvolved and the results are shown in Figure 4. Results from
resting and activated cell populations were added to yield total cell
abundance for each cell type where appropriate. Each purified cell
type was determined to be mostly pure and contaminated by less
than 10% of each other cell type, confirming the validity of the
basis set and its application to blood deconvolution.
Deconvolution of SLE patient and healthy donor blood
With the method of deconvolution validated and characterized
and a rich set of probesets and cell types defined for use in blood,
we investigated samples of biological interest for which the relative
abundance of cell types was unknown. Deconvolution was
performed on microarray expression data from white blood cell
samples from 72 SLE patients and 45 healthy donors (Table S2).
Proportions of cells of each type and state were calculated
(Figure 5A). Residuals from fitting the model were relatively low,
with a median of 0.11. Stability of the fits was analyzed by
repeating the fitting process with each of various cell types omitted
(i.e. ‘‘leave one out’’ testing); we observed that there was only a
very small disturbance in the results of the fit by the remaining
cells. Furthermore, the disturbance that did occur was confined to
cells that were very similar to the one that was omitted (Figure S4).
Figure 4. Performance of expression deconvolution on purified leukocytes supports using it on whole blood. Purification and
expression deconvolution of an independent test set of leukocytes from whole blood demonstrates that various cell types are properly deconvolved.
Plotted data is the calculated fraction of that cell type in the whole sample produced by deconvolution of each of the five purified cell types. Data
points are each from different donors.

Overall SLE patients displayed mild lymphopenia: for T, B, and
NK cells the sums of all cell counts of each cell type was found to
be significantly lower in SLE than in healthy controls. In order to
compare the degree of activation of different leukocyte types we
define activation as the ratio of the abundance of activated cells of
a given type to the abundance of resting cells of that type. T helper
cells, NK cells, and monocytes were each found to be significantly
activated in SLE compared to healthy controls. NK cells were on
average 149-fold more activated in SLE, while T helper cells were
59-fold more activated. In contrast, B cells and cytotoxic T cells
displayed no significant activation. Dendritic cells were undetect￾able (at or below the lower limit of detection) except for activated

dendritic cells in SLE. Although their activation cannot be
accurately calculated using the definition of activation used here,
the abundance of activated dendritic cells at almost 2% in SLE
samples is significant and notable. Neutrophil and plasma cell
levels were not significantly different between SLE patients and
healthy controls.
We tested these results’ validity by comparing them to counts of
total lymphocytes, total monocytes, and neutrophils determined by
CBC differentials performed on the same blood samples
(Figure 5B). The correlations between the two methods were
reasonably good (average Pearson coefficient = 0.5196) and very
consistent between different cell types (standard deviation of the
mean = 0.136). To specifically validate findings of particular
interest from deconvolution, we purified and quantified activated
NK and T helper cells from SLE patients and healthy controls and
tested their level of activation using the conventional method of
FACS. Purified NK cells were stained with the classical activation
marker CD62L. Consistent with results from deconvolution, two
out of three patients showed substantial activation of NK cells
compared to healthy donors, while one patient showed mildly
elevated levels of NK cell activation (Figure 6A). CD4+ T helper
cells purified and stained for the marker of naı¨ve T cells CD62L
show significant down-regulation (Figure 6B), indicating activation
and suggesting a transition to a memory phenotype. To validate
our unexpected finding that B cells were not activated in lupus
patients we purified B cells from the same three patients and
quantified levels of CD80, a molecule found on the surface of
activated B cells that provides a costimulatory signal for T cell
activation. Two of the three patients’ B cells possessed increased
levels of CD80 (Figure 6C). To reconcile this observation with the
lack of B cell activation in the main SLE cohort we examined
CD80 levels in the expression profiles of the reference resting and
activated B cell samples used for deconvolution and found no
significant difference between the two groups.
Next we investigated whether there were specific relationships
between the quantities of pairs of different immune cell
compartments by examining the distribution of each pair of
immune cells in healthy and SLE individuals visually. Levels of T
helper cells and NK cells vary widely in both healthy and lupus
blood samples. However, there are no cases where moderate or
higher levels of both resting and activated cells exist in the same
sample (Figure 7A and B). Either most of these lymphocytes are
activated or very few are activated. Most of the SLE patients
appear to have either a greater proportion of activated T helper
cells or a greater proportion of activated NK cells than do healthy
individuals (Figure 7C). Additionally, most patients seem to have a
similar number of activated cells. In some patients there are more
activated T cells, and in others there are more activated NK cells.
This observation suggests that the total number of activated T
helper and NK cells is regulated. K-means clustering assigned
patients in this study into three discrete groups: those with a high
proportion of activated T cells, those with a high proportion of
activated NK cells, and those with low activation in both immune
cell subsets. Linear least-squares fitting on the two groups with a
high proportion of activated cells measures the hypothesized
maximum activation state to have a slope of negative one (slope of
21.00078, RMS error of 0.044). This supports the model of a
regulated activation state in lupus patients that can be achieved
either through activation of T cells or NK cells. Comparison of
levels of resting and activated monocytes (Figure 7D) showed that
total levels of monocytes are roughly constant and that as
increasing levels of activated monocytes are observed, decreasing
levels of resting monocytes are seen. This relationship is seen in
both SLE patients and healthy donors. As noted previously, SLE
patients showed a higher average abundance of activated
monocytes, although the total monocyte counts in the two groups
are comparable.
To further explore the potential significance of these findings,
we next explored whether immune cell levels in the main cohort
were related to clinical parameters such as patients’ disease
activity, medication, or traditional hematological measures.
Comparison of the abundance of immune cells with clinical
disease severity showed significant positive correlation between
patients’ SLEDAI (Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease
Activity Index) scores and the abundances of activated dendritic
cells and activated NK cells (Figure 8), but other immune cell types
were not significantly correlated with SLEDAI. Complement C3
and C4 levels were compared to immune cell levels and found to
be not significantly correlated (data not shown). In order to explore
possible relationships between medication and immune cell levels
we categorized the SLE patients according to whether they were
or were not currently undergoing treatment with corticosteroids,
azathioprine, or mycophenolate and then tested for differences in
the level of immune cell type based on the presence or absence of
each treatment. Populations of resting B cells and resting cytotoxic
T cells were both reduced significantly (Figure 9) by each
treatment, while the populations of these two cell types in their
activated state were not significantly different (data not shown). No
other cell types’ levels were affected as much by medication, nor
were any of them significantly affected by more than one
medication class, in contrast to B and CD8 T cells’ relationship
to all three classes of medication. We also examined whether
changes in cell abundance were related to current use of selective
serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI), Angiotensin Converting
Enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, statins, anti-malarial medications, or
beta-blockers and found no significant effects (data not shown).
Discussion
Microarray deconvolution is an emerging method for measur￾ing proportions of cell types or states in complex systems. The
studies reported here are the first application of this technique to
human biology, the first application to blood, and the first
application to study immune disease. The autoimmune disease
SLE is a prime example of a disease where determining the
proportions of immune cells is an important contribution to
understanding the etiology of the disease. In addition to the
biological advances, this study extends previous work on
deconvolution in several technical ways that are necessary to
support its application to SLE. First, we validate the method using
complex biological samples of known composition in order to
show that it can be performed on blood samples. Second, we
measure the performance of the method on a controlled system
with a precisely known answer. Third, we expand the number of
component cell types quantified in mixed samples, and we validate
the method on an independent test set of those cell types.
Here we find that patients suffering from SLE have some types
of blood cells activated predominantly: NK cells have the highest
activation, followed by T helper cells, monocytes, and dendritic
cells. This activation is validated by FACS analysis of blood
samples from an independent cohort of SLE patients and healthy
donors. Also, it is consistent with previous observations that genes
upregulated in response to interferon signaling are expressed at
high levels in lupus patients [6]. Many of these interferon
responsive genes are present at increased levels in the activated
versus resting lymphocytes observed here, suggesting that NK
cells, T helper cells, and monocytes are the circulating cells
principally responsive to type I interferon. Type I interferons are

Figure 6. FACS counting validates key findings from expression deconvolution. Quantifying levels of resting or activated lymphocytes from a
separate validation cohort by purifying and staining with markers of activation validates the two most significant findings from microarray
deconvolution of healthy and SLE patients’ blood. (a) NK cells purified and stained for the classical NK activation marker CD62 show significant activation
in two patients and mild trend towards activation in a third. (b) CD4+ T helper cells purified and stained for the marker of naı¨ve T cells CD62L show
significant downregulation, indicating activation and suggesting a transition to a memory phenotype. (c) CD19+ B cells purified and stained for the
marker of activated B cells CD80 show mixed results: no change in one patient, mild upregulation in another, and strong upregulation in the third.

also known to promote maturation of monocytes into conventional
dendritic cells (cDCs) [18], and this activity is consistent with our
observation that activated dendritic cells appear in the blood of
SLE patients. CDCs respond to bacterial infections and mediate
the associated exacerbations in SLE patients, and they have been
found to release IFN-alpha upon TLR4 ligation following priming
with IFN-beta [19], consistent with their apparent involvement
here.
Conventional methods that use gene expression to quantify
biological processes must use a single gene or a set of well￾correlated genes, but solving a system of gene expression equations
surmounts this limitation. For instance, RSAD2 (shown at the
bottom of figure 2) would be a relatively poor cell type marker but
is very valuable when quantifying cell types by the methods used
here, since it is significantly differentially expressed between many
different cell types. This gene is also important here because it is
well-established to be induced by type 1 interferons [20]. Among
the activated cell types considered here, RSAD2 expression is high
in those (and only those) that are found to be more abundant in
SLE patients. Therefore, this gene (and others with similar
expression profiles, not shown) and the results here based on it
support current views that the interferon signature observed in
Figure 7. Significant relationships exist between activation patterns of different cell populations. Visual analysis of T or NK cell types’
abundance from individual donors of the main cohort reveals further patterns. (a) Plotting of resting vs. activated NK cells shows that activation of NK
cells occurs to all NK cells simultaneously. (b) Plotting of resting vs. activated T helper cells shows that likewise activation of T cells occurs to all T cells
simultaneously. (c) Plotting of activated NK cells vs. activated T helper cells shows that most patients’ populations of these two cells appear to lie
along a negatively sloped line. Linear least squares fitting to those samples yields a line of slope 21.00078. (d) Levels of resting and activated
monocytes show a negative relationship with each other in both SLE and healthy donors.

most SLE patients is due to the simultaneous activation of several
classes of leukocytes by type 1 interferons and that this class of
cytokines is central to the disease (reviewed in [21]).
The dynamics of activation appear to differ among cell types.
For instance, monocytes constitute approximately the same
fraction of blood in all samples examined, and the distribution
of the proportion of resting to activated monocytes was fairly
uniform across its observed range. In contrast, both NK and T
helper lymphocytes were essentially fully activated or fully resting.
Unlike FACS, the algorithm used here cannot differentiate
between a population of a given cell type that are all
homogeneously mildly activated and a population of that cell
type that consists of a mixture of some resting cells and some
strongly activated cells, since the parameters used to assess
activation are merely the total quantity of each gene’s mRNA
present in the sample. The monocytes observed here might possess
the ability to adopt a mildly activated state, or perhaps they
function in discrete activation states like lymphocytes appear to but
differ in that the entire population of monocytes need not all be
resting or activated in unison.
In some cases the level of activation of a patient’s white blood
cells was correlated among different cell types. For instance,
dendritic cells’ and NK cells’ levels of activation are positively
correlated. However, some types of lymphocytes exhibit more
complex negative relationships. The maximum level of activated
NK cells and T helper cells in SLE patients appears to be constant
at approximately 30%. This is clearly seen in most SLE patients,
but healthy individuals typically have substantially fewer activated
lymphocytes. Although the results presented here offer no direct
evidence about the mechanisms by which this pattern occurs, the
data are consistent with the existence of a regulatory system that
constrains the maximum total level of these two cell types to 30%
and permits shifts in the balance between them. Both activated T
helper cells and activated NK cells exhibit signs of being important
to SLE pathology [16,22–25], even at the transcriptional level
[26]. Perhaps their relative levels define clinically important
subtypes of SLE, and if so they might be useful diagnostic markers
for this disease characteristic.
Several of the cell types that are hypothesized to be particularly
important in SLE are correlated with patients’ clinical measure￾ment of disease activity. Activated dendritic cells are efficient
antigen presentation machinery, and this cell type is found here to
be more abundant in patients with relatively active disease,
consistent with correlations between autoantibody blood titer and
SLE disease activity [27].
Other immune diseases may be amenable to the methods
presented here. One challenge will be the interpretation of
predictions in a disease that affects specific organs such as
rheumatoid arthritis where there is less evidence of a systemic
effect. Deconvolution of biopsies from these patients would have to
be interpreted with caution as individual cell types are difficult to
isolate from solid tissues for any validation. Moreover, biopsies
would contain significant quantities of cells of unknown type.
Therefore their signature genes would not be included in the basis
matrix for deconvolution. Of course, expanding the arsenal of data
on basis cell types would enable thorough analysis of such diverse
kinds of samples.
Expression deconvolution has several advantages over cell
sorting[28] or other traditional methods for quantification of cell
species. First, conventional methods deal with at most a handful of
different cell types at one time, while expression analysis can
simultaneously quantify a much greater number of cell types.
Second, deconvolution integrates the partially redundant infor￾mation of a large number of genes to yield its results; this
redundancy is important because it mitigates the contribution of
noise inherent in biological measurements and thus boosts
robustness. Third, post-hoc analysis of expression datasets is
relatively rapid, and there are a large and growing number of
datasets publicly available. Novel methods of expression analysis
like deconvolution have the potential to further tap this important
resource for the scientific community.
One concern with the application of a system of linear equations
such as used here is the mathematical structure of the problem: is it
well posed, what is the dimensionality and conditioning of the
matrix. The dimensions of the matrix are important because a
system of linear equations must be overdetermined- it must have
more equations than unknowns in order to not have multiple
perfect solutions, and in this case there are 360 equations and only
18 unknowns. The equations must be linearly independent- that is,
each sample’s expression signature must not be the equal to the
sum of other signatures when they are each multiplied by any
constant- this requirement is also satisfied. Finally, the matrix must

cohort are significantly correlated with activated NK cell or activated dendritic cell relative abundance. Diagonal lines and statistical metrics are from
the linear least squares fit to the plotted data.

be well conditioned. That is, the solutions yielded must be
relatively stable and not overly sensitive to small fluctuations in
input data. This characteristic represents a satisfactory bound on
the error of the solution for a given mixture, and can be thought of
as the result of a basis matrix that contains genes that together
form a complete but parsimonious set of robust markers for the cell
types of interest. The property of conditioning is quantified as the
condition number, a positive scalar value that is low when the
matrix is stable. As expected, the condition number was found to
be high for small or large numbers of genes and to have a
minimum for moderate numbers of genes. The basis matrices used
here were constructed in part by minimizing their condition
number, and they do in fact have condition numbers near zero.
The stability of the whole blood basis matrix was verified by
comparing results of deconvolution of whole blood using all cell
types to results obtained from deconvolution of the same samples
with one or two of the cell types omitted. Omission of a few cell
types did not grossly alter the results for the other cell types.
Reassuringly, those that were altered were the ones that would be
expected. For instance, omitting activated dendritic cells from the
basis matrix caused resting dendritic cells to be estimated slightly
higher in abundance since those two signatures are substantially
similar.
There are several limitations of microarray deconvolution that
bear discussion. One is that it produces answers about the
composition of a sample only for a given set of constituents, in this
case the immune cell subset profiles that form the basis matrix.
This set can be constructed beforehand or determined via
bootstrap methods from the mixture data itself, but either way it
may be incomplete or inaccurate. We have assembled a fairly
comprehensive set of immune cell subsets with which to analyze
SLE, but there are likely to be important subsets not profiled here.
Two cell types in particular are known to play important roles in
SLE but are not included here because they were deemed to be
too rare in blood to be reliably detected by this expression analysis
approach: regulatory T cells and plasmacytoid dendritic cells.
Regulatory T cell levels have been found to be higher in SLE
patients and to correlate with disease activity [29], and their

interactions with NK cells [30] make them a very interesting and
relevant cell type. Plasmacytoid dendritic cells are the major
source of type 1 interferons and are thought to be central to this
axis of SLE (reviewed in [31]). Although technically intractable
here, inclusion of these cells in studies of this kind would likely
offer further insights into SLE biology. Memory T cells were also
omitted from the SLE analysis even though they were profiled in
the proof of concept experiment because we chose to subset T cells
for the basis matrix by CD4/CD8 status and activation status.
Adding yet another orthogonal factor, memory status, would have
multiplied the number of T cell profiles from four to twelve, an
extension that would be interesting but is beyond the scope of this
work.
The conspicuous lack of increase of activated B cells or plasma
cells in our survey of SLE samples may be due to dissimilarity
between the in vitro stimulated B cells and CD138+ purified plasma
cells we used and the populations of plasma cells that produce the
autoreactive antibodies that are a hallmark of SLE. We performed
both canonical cytokine activation of B cells and B Cell Receptor
ligation via anti-IgM antibodies, but neither protocol for B cell
activation yielded a signature that was detected at a higher level in
SLE than healthy controls. We confirm in the validation samples
that the level of the activation marker CD80 is elevated on B cells
from some SLE patients and show that this marker is not
differentially upregulated in our in vitro activated B cell cultures.
This resolves the apparent conflict between the results presented
here and the general view that B cells are activated in SLE disease,
and it underscores the importance of capturing the complexity of
relevant cell biology as fully as possible in any set of basis samples
to be used for expression deconvolution.
Lahdesmaki et al. [32] used a Bayesian approach to deconvolu￾tion that avoids a priori definition of basis groups and instead
estimates them. Successful application of this approach requires a
dataset with a relatively large number of cell types with linearly
independent expression profiles. In our hands, use of the biological
knowledge of important immune cell subsets and our definitions of
their expression profiles increased the accuracy of deconvolution
predictions.
Another limitation of microarray deconvolution is the discrete
nature of the component cell types in the basis set. The model
assumes that cells do not exist in significant quantities in states
intermediate between those that are purified and profiled for
inclusion in the basis set. This issue has been addressed in one
study: continuous variation in the expression levels of genes have
been mapped to continuous cellular states in cell cycle experiments
in yeast [33]. Immune cells also exist at different points in a
continuum of states of differentiation and activation. However, we
did not consider these states here because of the complexity of
modeling the large number of intermediates stemming from a
group of eighteen basis cell types. We did observe that the
residuals from fitting of immune cell basis matrices to the SLE
blood in this study were small, indicating that the discrete model’s
assumptions are valid. We assume that the residuals are due to a
combination of technical noise and incomplete sampling of
expression profiles of leukocyte populations. The relative contri￾butions of these two factors are not known, but we predict that fit
could be further improved if the different states of immune cells
were more fully represented. For example, it might be advanta￾geous to capture varying degrees of activation by contrasting
signatures of cells that are resting and activated in vitro. Also, the
canonical activation of cells used in this study are widely believed
to simulate in vivo activation reasonably well, but there are other
forms of activation (e.g. Th1/Th2/Th17/Treg cell polarization)
that could be performed and profiled on microarrays to better
capture the spectrum of leukocyte populations in blood.
Expression deconvolution may actually even have the potential
to help identify these cells or states. In this study we selected genes
that discriminated between the cell types we had chosen to assay;
this step improves the performance of the method but likely
implicitly excludes the best markers for cell types that were not
chosen. If the approach was modified to include more genes, then
the subset of those extra genes that fit poorly might be good
markers for cell types or states that should have been profiled but
were not. Alternatively, the solution based on an optimal set of
basis genes could then be used as a standard against which to
measure the fit of each other gene measured on the microarray,
and the genes with substantial expression that is under-predicted
or not reflected in any of the basis components could be
considered a candidate marker for an important cell type or cell
state that remains to be profiled. We imagine that the responses of
leukocytes to the wide variety of cytokines that they might
encounter would be the most prominent discoveries yielded by this
approach.
There are other possible causes of residuals. For example, a
recent study exploring the heterotypic interactions between
human cancer-derived cell lines and stromal fibroblasts[34] finds
that a minority of genes show interaction effects. Determining all
of these interaction effects is intractable if the number of cell types
involved is more than three or four, but nevertheless this issue
exists and may be a source of error in a linear model that does not
incorporate it. Interestingly, this study used microarray data to
explicitly quantify heterotypic interactions between the cancer and
stromal cells in vitro, and this approach could be applicable to
leukocytes.
The deconvolution results reported here are interesting
observations of activated states of lymphocytes in SLE patients.
This could be confirmed as meaningful to disease progression by
extending this analysis to longitudinal data from SLE patients with
blood collected at multiple time points. Patients may also respond
differently to therapies based on their deconvolution results. We
have proposed that there is a regulation of the maximum
activation of lymphocytes. Drugs targeting positive or negative
regulators of the activation of different lymphocytes may show an
effect on the slope or percent of the maximum activation state we
observe. In summary, deconvolution can provide a powerful
insight into the immune response in patients with autoimmune
disease.

Purification of Leukocyte Populations
Eighteen compartments and activation states of leukocytes were
purified and treated as described previously[12] and are
summarized in Table 1.
Clinical samples
T cell subsets for the proof of concept experiment were prepared as
follows: peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated
from healthy donors via leukopacks as previously described [12]. A
portion of each PBMC sample was assayed on gene expression
microarrays, while the remainder was used for further purification.
PBMCs were enriched for CD4+ T cells using MACS beads for
negative selection as per manufacturer’s recommendations. CD4+ T
cells were then labeled with CCR7-FITC, CD45RO-PE, CD62L￾PECy5, CD45RA-APC and CD4-PECy7 and sorted by FACS into
the following subsets: naive (CD4+CD45RA+CCR7+CD62L+),
central memory (CD4+CD45RO+CCR7+CD62L+) and effector
memory (CD4+CD45RO+CCR72CD62L+/2). FACS profiles of
cell sorting are shown in Figure S5.
Pure CD4+ T cells, CD19+ B cells, CD56+ NK cells, and
CD14+ monocytes used for confirmation of the deconvolution
method were isolated from whole blood obtained from healthy
donors by Ficoll gradient centrifugation followed by negative
selection. Purity was confirmed by FACS with positive markers.
Patient selection
Whole white blood cell samples for exploratory analysis were
collected from 72 SLE patients and 45 healthy donors (the test
cohort) by Gene Logic Corporation (Gaithersburg, MD). Demo￾graphic information on this cohort is shown in Table 2. Three
additional patients with active SLE were recruited from the
outpatient rheumatology clinic and in-patient services at the
University of Michigan. These patients, referred to as the
validation cohort, were used for FACS confirmation of results
obtained from the test cohort. Written informed consent was
obtained from all patients. Patients were selected as being over 21
years of age and meeting the diagnostic criteria of the American
College of Rheumatology (ACR) for SLE at the time of the visit.
Clinical data were collected for each visit and include disease
activity as assessed by the SLEDAI activity index, clinical
laboratory test results, and current medications.
Microarray sample processing
Total white blood cell RNA was obtained using the RNeasy
Midi kit and the ‘‘RNeasy Midi Protocol for Isolation of Total
Cellular RNA from Whole Blood’’ protocol (Qiagen). Purified
leukocyte RNA was obtained using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen).
Manufacturers protocol was followed for all steps and the optional
on-column DNase treatment was performed. RNA was quantified
using ultraviolet spectrophotometry. RNA was labeled for and
hybridized to AffymetrixTM HGU133 expression microarrays
assay using standard AffymetrixTM GeneChipTM protocols. Scan
data from microarrays was processed by AffymetrixTM Microarray
Analysis SuiteTM software version 5 to yield Signal data.
Computational and statistical methods
All statistical and matrix algebra calculations were performed
using the R Project software package [35].
Hierarchical clustering was performed on log2-transformed
data by hierarchically clustering using Pearson correlation
coefficient as the similarity metric and average-linkage for node
summarization.
Correlation tests between cell types and SLEDAI scores were
Spearman correlations, with p-values obtained using the ‘‘cor.test’’
function. Differential cellular abundance by treatment status was
tested by Wilcoxon Rank Sum test on linear data.
Expression deconvolution was performed on linear, untrans￾formed data as follows: in each mixture sample, the total
expression signal of each microarray probe was modeled as the
sum of the expression signals of its constituent parts, each of which
is described as a product of the expression signal of that probe in
that purified cell type times the fractional abundance of that cell
type in the mixture:
A11X1zA12X2 ... A1jXj~B1
A21X1zA22X2 ... A2jXj~B2
............
Ai1X1zAi2X2 ... AijXj~Bi
where Aij is an expression signal measurement in a purified cell, Bi
is an expression signal measurement in a mixture of cells, and Xj is
a fractional abundance, for each of i probesets and j cell types.
These equations may be rewritten as a matrix equation:
AX~B
where A is the basis matrix of the expression levels of all probesets
in all cell types, B is the vector of expression levels of all probesets
in one mixture, and X is the vector of the relative levels of cell
types comprising B. The equation was solved for X with the R
function ‘lsfit’ (a linear least squares algorithm) followed by
removal of the lowest negative coefficient from the equation and
iteration of the solution if necessary until all coefficients were non￾negative. Fractions of the cell types were determined by dividing
the coefficients by the yield of mRNA per cell input.
The probesets comprising the basis for deconvolution were the
subset of all probesets that maximized conditioning of the basis
matrix. They were determined as follows: top differentially￾expressed (based on 95% fold change confidence intervals from
Student’s T-test) probesets were determined by comparing each
probe’s highest-expressed group with the next highest-expressed
group in order to find probesets that are good markers for each cell
population. This step was repeated with comparison between the
top group and the third-highest group in order to also include
probesets that were strong markers for two cell populations. Basis
matrices of increasing numbers of top probesets picked separately
from both comparisons and from each group were created and
their condition number calculated. The function of condition

numbers of probesets (Figure S6). The matrix with the lowest
