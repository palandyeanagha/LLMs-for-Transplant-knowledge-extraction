Abstract


Background: Heterotaxia syndrome involves multiple anomalies,
including cardiac malformations and intestinal rotation
abnormalities. Most authors recommend routine radiological
evaluation, with laparotomy and Ladd procedure if a rotation
abnormality is found.
Aims: To determine if routine radiological screening is necessary,
and if there is a group of children that can safely be managed
expectantly.
Methods: Retrospective chart review of all children with
heterotaxia syndrome from 1968 to 2002.
Results: Complete data were available for 177 patients. Twenty
five (14%) had neonatal gastrointestinal symptoms (feeding
intolerance, vomiting). Eleven of these had gastrointestinal contrast
studies, of which seven were abnormal and led to surgery. Of the
152 asymptomatic neonates, nine had radiological screening and six
of these were abnormal. Only one was thought to have a narrow
based mesentery, but did not undergo surgery due to cardiac
disease. There were no intestinal complications on follow up in this
group. The other 143 asymptomatic children did not undergo
radiological screening and were closely followed. Four subsequently
developed gastrointestinal symptoms and had contrast studies; only
one of these had malrotation and underwent a Ladd procedure. Of
the remaining 139 patients who remained asymptomatic, 60 (43%)
died of cardiac disease and none developed intestinal symptoms or
complications related to malrotation on follow up.
Conclusion: Asymptomatic children with heterotaxia syndrome
have a low risk of adverse outcome related to intestinal rotation
abnormalities. Routine screening may not be necessary as long as
close follow up is done, and prompt investigation is performed for
those that develop gastrointestinal symptomatology.
