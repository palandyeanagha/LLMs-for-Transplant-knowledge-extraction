Pulse wave velocity (PWV) is a predictor of morbidity and mortality in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Dialysis
patients show cyclic changes in PWV related to their hydration status and blood pressure. Our aim is to assess the impact of
daily dialysis on PWV. We performed a randomized crossover study of 60 patients who underwent standard hemodialysis (HD)
three times per week for at least 6 months. Patients were classified into three groups according to their PWV values before (pre-)
and after (post-) HD, with a cutoff value of 12 m s1, as follows: the low–low (LL) group had normal pre-HD and post-HD PWV;
the high–low (HL) group had high pre-HD PWV and normal post-HD PWV; and the high–high (HH) group had high pre- and
post-HD PWV. All patients continued standard HD for 2 weeks. A total of 10 patients from each group were randomly assigned
to continue standard HD for 1 week and then underwent daily dialysis for 1 week. The remaining 10 patients underwent daily
dialysis for 1 week and then underwent standard HD for 1 week. PWV values were measured before and 1 h after each dialysis
session. With daily dialysis treatment, 2 of 20 patients (10%) moved from the PWV–HH group to the PWV–HL group, whereas
18 of 20 patients (90%) moved from the PWV–HL group to the PWV–LL group (P¼0.030). Daily dialysis reduces PWV in the
ESRD patients. As PWV is a strong predictor of mortality in ESRD and has cyclic variations in patients who are on standard HD,
we believe that daily dialysis may be used in patients with high PWV levels to reduce their mortality risk.

INTRODUCTION
Cardiovascular (CV) disease is the leading cause of mortality in
patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The identification of
CV risk factors, the extent to which they are predictive of mortality,
and the identification of patients who could benefit from early
interventions are of paramount importance in the management of
ESRD. Aortic stiffness, which is assessed through aortic pulse wave
velocity (PWV), is a predictor of morbidity and mortality in the
general population1–4 and in ESRD patients.5,6 We previously demon￾strated that hemodialysis (HD) patients have weekly cyclic variations
in PWV that correlate with their dialysis rhythms, hydration status
and blood pressure (BP).7 In addition, we observed for the first time
that different PWV behaviors during dialysis were associated with
different mortality risks.8 Patients with high PWV values before and
after HD had an increased mortality risk, compared with those with
low PWV values before and after HD, and those with high pre-dialysis
PWV levels and low post-dialysis levels.8 However, several studies have
shown that daily dialysis reduces patient mortality compared with
intermittent dialysis (three times per week), improving CV instability,
fluid overload, BP, electrolyte balance and poor clinical metabolic
conditions.9–12
Our aim is to assess the impact of daily dialysis on cyclic variations
of PWV in HD patients.
METHODS
We performed a controlled, prospective, crossover, randomized study.
The inclusion criteria were ESRD with a urinary output o200 ml per day,
treatment with chronic standard bicarbonate HD for at least 6 months (three
HD sessions of 4 h per week), and steady dry weight achieved in the previous 3
months (assessed by either inferior vena cava diameter or bioelectrical
impedance analysis). The exclusion criteria were acute CV accidents and
infections in the previous 3 months, advanced heart failure (New York Heart
Association stages III or IV), atrial fibrillation or arrhythmias, pacemaker
implantation, liver disease or ascites, acute or neoplastic illness, overt edema,
dysautonomic disease and diabetes. Patients were classified into three groups
on the basis of their PWV values, as described previously.7 The first group
included patients with PWV values o12 m s1 before and after HD (low–low:
LL). The second group included patients with PWV values 412 m s1 before
and o12 m s1 after HD (high–low: HL). The third group included patients
with PWV values 412 m s1 before and after HD (high–high: HH). A cutoff
value of 12 m s1 was used, as indicated in a previous study, which provided the
first evidence that an increased aortic stiffness (exceeding 12 m s1) is a strong
independent predictor of an all-cause and mainly of CV mortality in the ESRD
patients.13
In total, 160 patients were screened. It was possible to match only 60 patients
for sex and age into the three study groups. The small number of enrolled
patients was sufficient for a correct analysis, because we used a crossover design.
We hypothesized that more than 66% of patients would reduce their PWV
values. The study duration was 1 month. The included patients continued the

4-h HD three times per week for 2 weeks. After this study period, 10 patients
from each PWV group were randomly chosen to continue the 4-h HD three
times per week for 1 week, and then they underwent daily HD for 1 week
(150–180 min, 6 out of 7 days). The remaining 10 patients in the three groups
underwent daily dialysis for 1 week, followed by the 4-h HD three times per
week for 1 week. The data used for the statistical analysis were collected during
the last 2 weeks. Figure 1 shows a diagram of the experimental procedure.
HD sessions were comparable during the study period. For a three-times￾per-week dialysis schedule, the dialysis length was 240 min, and 64±3 l of
blood was treated. For a daily dialysis schedule, the dialysis length was 180 min,
and 63±4 l of blood was treated (P¼0.134). The dialysis bath composition was
similar in both the treatments (sodium: 138–145 mmol l1; calcium:
1.5 mmol l1, magnesium: 0.5 mg l1; potassium: 2–3 mmol l1).
The patients underwent dialysis while lying in bed. Measurements were
made immediately before (pre) and 1 h after (post) each dialysis session. BP
was measured using a mercury sphygmomanometer; the first and fifth Korotk￾off sounds were used to identify systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP, respectively.
The mean of three consecutive BP measurements was recorded and used for the
statistical analysis. Body weight was detected using a bed balance, using a scale
with a sensitivity of 0.05 kg (Tassinari, Cento, Italy). The carotid–femoral PWV
was measured with an automated system (Pulse Pen, DiaTecne, Milan, Italy)
according to the foot-to-foot method.7 Carotid and femoral waveforms were
acquired simultaneously with two pressure-sensitive transducers, and the
transit time of the pulse was calculated by the system software program. The
distance between the two arterial sites was measured on the body, using a tape
measure, and the PWV was calculated as the distance divided by time (meters
per second). At least 12 successive readings were used for the analysis to cover a
complete respiratory cycle. All PWV measurements were performed by the
same operator, and the mean of three consecutive measurements (taken 5 min
apart) was used for statistical analyses. If the coefficient of variation (Co-V) for
PWV was 45%, the patient was excluded from the study (none of the patients
showed Co-V for PWV 45%). The observed PWV (PWV-o) was measured
and normalized (PWV-n) to the SBP and heart rate (HR) according to the
following formula: PWV-n¼PWV-o(SBP-n/SBP-o)(HR-n/HR-o), where
SBP-n is the normalized SBP (reference value¼130 mm Hg), SBP-o is the
observed SBP, HR-n is the normalized HR (reference value¼72 beats per min)
and HR-o is the observed HR. The PWV-n was used for the statistical analysis.
It is important to consider that when the PWV-o was normalized for BP and
HR, the cyclic changes in PWV were unmodified, with only minor changes in
single values during each of the repeated measurements.7
Pre-dialysis serum creatinine, urea, calcium, ionized calcium, serum phos￾phates, sodium, potassium, bicarbonates and hemoglobin levels were measured
at baseline and at the end of the study. Serum albumin, blood lipids, plasma
fibrinogen, C-reactive protein and parathyroid hormone levels were measured
at baseline. CV history and pharmacological therapy were recorded at baseline
for each patient. The coronary artery calcification score was assessed at baseline
by multi-slice, light-speed equipment (GE Medical System, Chicago, IL,
USA).14 Investigators were instructed to achieve the therapeutic targets accord￾ing to current clinical practice guidelines. The target BP was p130/80 mm Hg
and the target hemoglobin levels and transferrin saturation were 11 g dl1 and
20% or above, respectively. The target levels for glycated hemoglobin (Hb1c),
total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides were less
than 7%, 200, 100 and 180 mg dl1, respectively. Sampling was performed
during the second session of the week, which is in line with the center’s policy
to obtain the correct dialysis dosage. The blood sample that was used to
determine the final plasma urea concentration was drawn from the arterial line
10 s after the reduction of the blood flow to 100 ml min1, with dialysate flow
in bypass and by clamping the venous line after the venous bubble trap. The
estimated Kt/V and equilibrated protein catabolic rate values were calculated
using procedures and simplified equations according to Daugirdas.15
The ethics committee of ASL AVELLINO approved the study according to
the Helsinki Declaration, and all patients gave written informed consent.
Statistics
All values are reported as the means±s.d. Analysis of variance was used to
compare the different groups. The differences in frequencies were determined
by a w2-analysis. A multivariate regression analysis was used to analyze the
changes in PWV, adjusting for baseline PWV, pre-dialysis BP and ultrafiltration
rates. Variable significance was defined as Po0.05, which was adjusted for all
variables in the final model.
RESULTS
Table 1 shows the data of all patients in the study group. The three
groups were homogeneous for sex, age, BP and serum chemistry
(phosphorus, calcium, hemoglobin, parathyroid hormone, albumin,
low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and C-reactive protein). The HH
group had an elevated prevalence of ASCVD (cerebrovascular disease,
peripheral vascular disease, history of angina pectoris and history of
myocardial infarction; Po0.001). The coronary artery calcification

(Po0.001) were significantly higher in the HH group. The antihy￾pertensive therapy that was used before the beginning of the study was
continued for the entire month; angiotensin-converting-enzyme
inhibitors were used in 70%, sartanics in 60%, beta-blockers in
50%, calcium-antagonist in 25%, and others in 25% of the patients.
In total, 20% of the patients received two anti-hypertensive drugs,
40% received three drugs, 30% received four drugs, and 10% received
five drugs.
Table 2 shows the difference between dialysis three times per week
and daily dialysis in all patients: dry weight, ultrafiltration rate, pre￾dialysis SBP and pre-dialysis diastolic BP were significantly reduced
during daily dialysis compared with dialysis administered three times
per week.
At baseline, in the PWV–HH group, four patients had PWV
between 12 and 14 m s1, nine patients had PWV between 14 and
18 m s1, and seven patients had PWV 418 m s1. In the PWV–HL
group, three patients had PWV between 12 and 14 m s1, eight
patients had PWV between 14 and 18 m s1, and nine patients had
PWV 418 m s1. Figure 1a shows the pre- and post-dialysis PWV
measurements of the study participants obtained during the three￾times-per-week dialysis treatment. The PWV–HH group had an
average PWV of 14.75±2.2 m s1; the PWV–HL groups had an
average value of 11.23±3.4 m s1; and the PWV–LL group had an
average PWV of 9.23±1.7 m s1 (Po0.0001; post-hoc Bonferroni
analysis PWV–HH Po0.05 vs. other groups; PWV–HL before HD
vs. after HD, Po0.05). Figure 2 shows the pre- and post-dialysis PWV
measurements of subjects during their daily dialysis treatments as
follows: the PWV–HH group had an average PWV of
14.68±2.4 m s1; the PWV–HL group had an average PWV of
9.21±2.1 m s1; and the PWV–LL group had an average PWV of
8.96±1.9 m s1 (Po0.0001; post-hoc Bonferroni analysis PVW–HH
Po0.05 vs. other groups). During daily dialysis treatment
(Figure 3), 2 of 20 patients (10%) moved from the PWV–HH
group to the PWV–HL group (one patient had a baseline PWV
value between 12 and 14 m s1, and one had a baseline PWV value
between 14 and 18 m s1), whereas 18 of 20 patients (90%) moved
from the PWV–HL group to the PWV–LL group (three patients had
baseline PWV between 12 and 14 m s1, eight patients had baseline
PWV between 14 and 18 m s1, and seven patients had baseline PWV
418 m s1; P¼0.030). Patients in the PWV–LL group showed low
levels of PWV during the daily dialysis.
Table 3 shows the predictors associated with the variations in PWV
values by the means of multiple logistic regression, and the PWV
variations depend from low baseline PWV values (P¼0.03) and daily
dialysis (Po0.01), pre-SBP. Pre-SBP values and the ultrafiltration rate
were not significant.

DISCUSSION
Our group showed for the first time that individual PWV levels in
dialysis patients undergo cyclic changes during each weekly period.
PWV decreased during the dialysis sessions and increased during the
interdialytic periods,7 and three different PWV behaviors were
defined; some patients had high levels of PWV before dialysis (using
a cut-off value of 12 m s1) that remained high after dialysis; some
patients had high pre-dialysis PWV values that became normal after
dialysis; and other patients had normal levels of PWV both before and
after dialysis.7 We also showed that different PWV behaviors due to
the cyclic changes that were observed during dialysis are related to a
difference in mortality in dialysis patients, with higher mortality in the
patients with increased PWV before and after HD.8 Moreover, there
was a significant decrease in aortic PWV when a three-times-per-week
dialysis schedule was replaced with daily dialysis. In fact, 10% of
PWV–HH patients moved to the PWV–HL group, whereas 90% of
PWV–HL patients reduced their PWV to below 12 m s1 after under￾going daily dialysis. Notably, all patients were treated with both
dialysis schedules to obtain the same values of blood volume treated
(P¼0.121) and dialytic efficiency (weekly Kt/V; P¼0.082). Pre-dialysis
SBP and dry weight were lower (Po0.0001) with daily dialysis. We
observed a reduction in the aortic PWV after 1 week of daily dialysis
treatment. Our hypothesis is that, before the arterial wall alterations
become structural, characterized by a loss of elastin fibers and an
increase in collagen, there is a functional phase during which a
treatment aimed to reduce the PWV could allow the recovery of the
arterial wall. Calcifications are probably an indirect sign of the
transition from functional damage to structural changes of the arterial
wall;16 in fact, patients from the PWV–HH group had a significantly
higher prevalence of ASCVD and higher coronary artery calcification
score compared with the other two groups. A better control of fluid
overload, which is obtained with slower ultrafiltration during daily
dialysis, contributes to the normalization of PWV. A reduction of 4 kg
in the dry weight was obtained in the same patient after switching
from standard HD to daily HD.17–19 However, fluid overload control
is not the only explanation for a reduction in dry weight. Agarwal and
Light,17 who studied 11 833 BP measurements from 125 HD patients,
showed that the median weight gain was 2.4 kg over an interdialytic
period, which would result in a 5-mm Hg increase in systolic pressure,
a 2-mm Hg increase in diastolic pressure, and a 3-mm Hg increase in
pulse pressure. This change would be in addition to an increase of
6.2 mm Hg in systolic pressure, 3.5 mm Hg in diastolic pressure, and
3.1 mm Hg in pulse pressure, if no weight gain occurred. Thus,
interdialytic weight gain has a substantial role in the interdialytic
increases in BP, but there is a great variability in the influence of
weight gain on BP. Therefore, the role of daily dialysis on the renin–
angiotensin–aldosterone system should also be considered.19
Our results are of great importance, because we studied high-risk
patients who could benefit from a specific intervention and who might
be studied in future randomized, controlled trials. In fact, the majority
of patients receive a 4-h HD three times per week, according to a
calculation of dialysis adequacy. With HD three times per week, the
relatively long interval between dialysis sessions results in a ‘peak-and￾valley’ effect, which is characterized by fluctuations in the levels of
toxins and body fluid volume.20 Several studies have shown that
increasing the frequency of dialysis improves outcomes such as
anemia, left ventricular hypertrophy, calcium and phosphorus balance
and health-related quality of life. Therefore, shorter but more frequent
dialysis sessions appear to be a potential solution to this problem.21,22
On the contrary, several reports have suggested that cyclic changes
in body weight and BP, which are typically observed when undergoing
HD three times per week, influence arterial stiffness and PWV
values.17,18,23 Prospective epidemiological studies have drawn atten￾tion to the arterial elastic properties as independent and strong CV
risk factors and predictors of all-cause and CV death.13,24–29 The role
of the arterial system is to dampen the pressure oscillations and obtain
a stable flow to the peripheral tissues. The efficiency of this function
depends on the elastic properties of the arterial walls and the
geometries of the arteries. In normal conditions, approximately 10%
of the energy produced during systole is stored in the arterial walls.
During diastole, the energy stored recoils the elastic arteries, squeezing
the stored blood forward into the peripheral tissue. When the arterial
system is rigid, this mechanism does not function, and the stroke
volume flows through the peripheral tissues only during systole.30
Our study has some limitations, including the following: (1) a small
sample size, (2) a short duration of follow-up, and (3) a lack of
information about smoking status. Despite the small number of
patients included in this study, we used a crossover design to increase
the power of the study. The follow-up duration was short, because we
aimed to study the early changes in PWV due to daily dialysis. Further
studies are needed to confirm our data and to assess the long-term
effects of daily dialysis on PWV.
In conclusion, we showed for the first time that daily dialysis
reduces PWV values. As we used low-cost and easily available tools to
identify and treat high-risk patients, this method should be considered
in daily clinical practice to predict adverse outcomes and reduce
mortality in this subgroup of ESRD patients.
