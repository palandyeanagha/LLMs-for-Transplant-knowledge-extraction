Plasmodium falciparum, which causes the most lethal form of human malaria, replicates in the host liver dur￾ing the initial stage of infection. However, in vivo malaria liver-stage (LS) studies in humans are virtually 
impossible, and in vitro models of LS development do not reconstitute relevant parasite growth conditions. To 
overcome these obstacles, we have adopted a robust mouse model for the study of P. falciparum LS in vivo: the 
immunocompromised and fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase–deficient mouse (Fah–/–, Rag2–/–, Il2rg–/–, termed the 
FRG mouse) engrafted with human hepatocytes (FRG huHep). FRG huHep mice supported vigorous, quantifi￾able P. falciparum LS development that culminated in complete maturation of LS at approximately 7 days after 
infection, providing a relevant model for LS development in humans. The infections allowed observations 
of previously unknown expression of proteins in LS, including P. falciparum translocon of exported proteins 
150 (PTEX150) and exported protein-2 (EXP-2), components of a known parasite protein export machinery. 
LS schizonts exhibited exoerythrocytic merozoite formation and merosome release. Furthermore, FRG mice 
backcrossed to the NOD background and repopulated with huHeps and human red blood cells supported 
reproducible transition from LS infection to blood-stage infection. Thus, these mice constitute reliable models 
to study human LS directly in vivo and demonstrate utility for studies of LS–to–blood-stage transition of a 
human malaria parasite.
Introduction
Plasmodium falciparum is the most deadly of the human malaria 
parasites. The disease continues to be a global health crisis and 
causes more than 250 million new clinical cases annually, resulting 
in over 800,000 deaths, mostly of children in sub-Saharan Africa 
(1). Female anopheline mosquitoes introduce infectious sporo￾zoites into the host dermis when taking a blood meal. Sporozo￾ites exit the bite site by migration, enter a blood vessel, and are 
carried to the liver (2). Here, each sporozoite traverses numerous 
hepatocytes before it invades a final hepatocyte with the formation 
of a parasitophorous vacuole (PV) (3). Ensconced in the PV, the 
parasite undergoes liver-stage (LS, also called exoerythrocytic form 
[EEF]) development, culminating in the formation and release of 
tens of thousands of first generation merozoites (4). This preeryth￾rocytic phase of the parasite life cycle is asymptomatic, and all 
clinical pathologies are caused by the ensuing asexual erythrocytic 
stage of infection. The erythrocytic stages are routinely studied 
in vitro, made possible by the development of a continuous cul￾ture system that allows asexual parasite replication in human rbc 
(hurbc) (5). However, studying the biology and pathophysiology 
of P. falciparum in vivo is difficult and is hampered by the lack of 
adequate animal models. Sporogonic stages are generated by feed￾ing female Anopheles mosquitoes on in vitro gametocyte cultures, 
allowing progression of the parasite life cycle in the mosquito and 
subsequent sporozoite accumulation in the mosquito salivary 
glands. However, the P. falciparum LS has proven much more dif￾ficult to study even though complete LS development in primary 
human hepatocytes (huHeps) and subsequent transition to an in 
vitro erythrocytic infection was shown over 25 years ago (6). Prima￾ry huHeps can be obtained both freshly isolated and cryopreserved 
from a variety of sources, but are in limited supply, do not prolifer￾ate in vitro, and are variable in their ability to support P. falciparum
LS development. A huHep cell line (HC-04) that allows for com￾plete P. falciparum LS development has been reported, although in 
this cell line, the rate of infection is low: 0.07% (7). Furthermore, 
complete LS development is difficult to obtain in vitro because it 
requires more than 7 days of culture and conditions are often not 
commensurate with extended culture periods. As a result of the 
aforementioned difficulties, few data on human malaria parasite 
LS biology are available. Conversely, rodent malaria models of LS 
development, both Plasmodium berghei and Plasmodium yoelii, are 
routinely used to study LS. These studies have led to a wealth of 
knowledge on LS biology, including development, differentiation, 
host/parasite interactions, and organelle replication as well as the 
effects of gene deletions on LS development (8).
Fluorescent P. yoelii parasites have been generated (9) and used to 
obtain LS transcriptomes and proteomes following the isolation 
and manipulation of infected hepatocytes by FACS (10), and thus, 
a wealth of data are available from which predictions of cellular 
and metabolic pathways for LS development can be inferred. For 
example, access to the LS proteome led to the hypothesis that de 
novo fatty acid synthesis would be essential to the development 
of LS, and this has indeed been shown by functional studies (11, 
12). Nevertheless, there are clearly unique aspects to P. falciparum
LS biology. Rodent malaria LS development takes just over 2 days, 
whereas P. falciparum LS development takes a week. Additionally, 
P. falciparum LSs express proteins that do not have rodent malaria

development will be a robust tool to further study the biology of 
human LS parasites. Furthermore, the ability to transition P. falci￾parum from LS–to–blood-stage infection allows complete life-cycle 
progression in the laboratory. This will accelerate fundamental 
studies, such as parasite genetic crosses, in a small animal model.
Results
P. falciparum in vivo LS development in the FRG huHep mouse. The FRG 
huHep mice (all female) used in this study were obtained from the 
Yecuris Corp., and the huHep repopulation index of the mouse 
liver was estimated based on the levels of human serum albumin. 
Repopulation of all mice used in the study ranged between 60% 
and 90% (data not shown). Sporozoites used for the study were 
generated in Anopheles stephensi mosquitoes that had been fed on 
mature gametocyte cultures of P. falciparum NF54 parasites or, in 
one instance, the GFP-expressing NF54HT-GFP parasite. Mice 
were injected intravenously with sporozoites and sacrificed 3, 5, 6, 
and 7 days after infection, at which time liver tissue was collected 
for transcriptional analysis, histological evaluation and indirect 
immunofluorescence assays (IFAs).
IFAs on infected liver sections demonstrated that P. falciparum
LS developed in the FRG huHep mice. At day 3 after infection, 
spherical LS were detected using a circumsporozoite protein 
(CSP) antibody, which localizes to the parasite surface and, as 
expected, was expressed in a circumferential pattern (Figure 1A). 
Using an antibody specific for human FAH, it was evident that 
P. falciparum LS always grew within the huHeps (Figure 1A). DAPI 
staining showed between 4 and 8 nuclear centers on day 3 of LS, 
indicating that parasite DNA replication was progressing. At day 
5 after infection, LS had further grown and maintained their near 
spherical shape. The parasites were specifically labeled with an 
antibody to exported protein-2 (EXP-2) (26) in a pattern indica￾tive of PV localization (Figure 1B). EXP-2 was previously localized 
to the PV membrane (PVM) of blood stages (27). More recently, 
EXP-2 was shown to be part of the P. falciparum translocon of 
exported proteins (PTEX) (28), a translocon that is believed to be 
responsible for the trafficking of exported parasite proteins into 
the erythrocyte cytoplasm. A further protein component of the 
translocon is PTEX150, and interestingly, we also detected expres￾sion of this protein at 5 days of LS development (Figure 1B). Its 
localization was similar to that seen for EXP-2 (Figure 1B). Thus, 
components of the translocon are present in LS and are local￾ized to the PV. Day 5 LS still expressed CSP (Figure 1B), the tran￾script of which was also detected at this time point in the SCID 
Alb-uPA huHep mouse LS infections (16). Day 5 LS also expressed 
PF10_0164 (ETRAMP10.3) (Figure 1B) in the PVM, the syntenic 
ortholog of the rodent malaria parasite gene coding for UIS4 
(14). At day 7 after infection, we observed large multinucleated 
LS schizonts that had displaced the surrounding tissue. The LS 
were readily detected with EXP-2 and merozoite surface protein 1 
(MSP1) antibodies (Figure 1, C and D). Codetection with the FAH 
antibody clearly showed the LS contained within a vastly expand￾ed huHep with only remnant cytoplasm and a single nucleus 
pushed to the periphery of the infected cell (Figure 1C). The 
pattern of EXP-2 expression ceased to be circumferential, result￾ing in a complex internal pattern of staining as seen in Figure 
1C, likely due to EXP-2 expression being associated with the PV 
lumen at this developmental stage. The PVM markers EXP-1 and 
EXP-2 did not overlap in late LS parasites, indicating that EXP-1 
remained in the PVM during late LS development, but EXP-2 did 
orthologs such as LS antigen 1 (LSA1) (13). Furthermore, studies 
have shown that syntenic Plasmodium genes do not always share 
the same biological function in P. falciparum and rodent malaria 
models (14). Thus, it is imperative to develop robust small animal 
models for P. falciparum that allow analysis of various aspects of LS 
biology in vivo.
Recent advances in the use of immunocompromised mice 
engrafted with huHeps enabled the creation of human liver–chi￾meric mice. In vivo P. falciparum LS development has been shown 
in one of these models, the SCID mouse homozygous for the 
urokinase-type plasminogen activator transgene (uPa) under the 
albumin promoter (Alb): the SCID Alb-uPA mouse, engrafted with 
huHeps (15, 16). The SCID Alb-uPA huHep mouse has also been 
successfully used to study hepatitis B (17) and hepatitis C (18) and 
was used more recently to study the attenuation of a P. falciparum
parasite that fails to complete LS development (19). However, due 
to chronic liver disease, the adult mice only weigh about 10–12 
grams, and the neonates suffer bleeding problems (20), making 
the SCID Alb-uPA mouse extremely challenging to work with. The 
mice must be bred as heterozygotes, and transplantation with 
huHep must take place right before weaning to rescue the fatal 
phenotype. Furthermore, the Alb-uPA transgene can revert, lead￾ing to repopulation of the liver with mouse hepatocytes. To over￾come the obstacles associated with the SCID Alb-uPA mouse (21), 
we have utilized a different and more robust mouse model that 
can be repopulated with huHep, the immunocompromised and 
fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase–deficient mouse (Fah–/–, Rag2–/–, 
Il2rg–/–, termed the FRG mouse) as well as the FRG mouse back￾crossed to the NOD background (FRG NOD).
The FRG mouse is a triple gene knockout (22, 23). R denotes 
recombination-activating gene 2 (Rag2), and G denotes IL-2 recep￾tor subunit γ (Il2rg). The Rag2–/– and Il2rg–/– phenotype is a severely 
immunocompromised mouse lacking B, T, and NK cells that does 
not reject xenotransplanted huHeps. The F denotes fumarylaceto￾acetate hydrolase (Fah). Due to the lack of FAH, the hepatocytes 
of Fah–/– mice suffer buildup of intracellular fumarylacetoacetate, 
resulting in their death. The phenotype is ablated by the addition 
of 2-(2-nitro-4-trifluoromethylbenzoyl)-1, 3-cyclohexanedione 
(NTBC) to the mouse diet (24). FRG mice implanted with huHeps 
(FRG huHep) are cycled with NTBC, which allows for the repopu￾lation of the mouse liver with huHeps when regulated destruction 
of the mouse hepatocytes occurs by NTBC withdrawal. Repopu￾lation levels can reach in excess of 90%. Unlike the SCID Alb-uPA
mouse, the FRG mice are healthy, breed as homozygotes, and are 
free of liver damage while dosed with NTBC. Furthermore, huHep 
that have proliferated in a donor FRG mouse can be serially trans￾planted into many recipient mice, which allows for the rapid 
expansion of animals repopulated with isogenic hepatocytes (22). 
Recent studies with FRG huHep mice have shown that they can be 
used for studies of infection with both hepatitis B and hepatitis 
C viruses (25).
We have successfully infected FRG huHep mice with P. falciparum
sporozoites and observed LS developmental progression to full 
maturation, exoerythrocytic merozoite formation, and merosome 
release over a 7-day period. Furthermore, FRG mice backcrossed 
to the NOD background and repopulated with huHeps and hurbc 
supported complete LS development and a reproducible transition 
to blood-stage infection. Blood-stage infections were subsequently 
maintained in continuous culture. Our results show that the FRG 
huHep and FRG NOD huHep mouse models of P. falciparum LS

MSP1 staining was indicative of cytomere formation, where mul￾tiple invaginations of the parasite plasma membrane eventually 
lead to the pinching off of membrane around each nascent exo￾erythrocytic merozoite. In contrast with the MSP1 staining, the 
PVM marker EXP-1 could clearly be seen to delineate the confines 
of the LS parasite where cytomere formation was still taking place 
(Figure 1D). All day 7 LS examined showed robust expression of 
MSP1, and in highly humanized parts of the liver substantial 
not (Supplemental Figure 1A; supplemental material available 
online with this article; doi:10.1172/JCI62684DS1). Furthermore, 
at day 7, PTEX150 (28) expression and EXP-2 expression showed 
a partially overlapping staining pattern (Supplemental Figure 
1B). Late LS development is marked by the expression of MSP1 
and subsequent formation of merozoites, with MSP1 expression 
localized to the merozoite surface. Indeed, at day 7 after infection, 
there was robust expression of MSP1 (Figure 1D). The pattern of

antibodies to EXP-1. DNA was visualized with DAPI, and differential interference contrast microscopy images of the liver sections were captured.

process in P. falciparum LS. This was indicated by the observation 
that the PVM marker EXP-1 in a fully mature LS labeled only a 
small PVM remnant (Figure 2E and Supplemental Figure 3).
LS growth and gene transcription in the FRG huHep mouse. To further 
investigate LS growth in FRG huHep infections, the maximum 
area of multiple LS cross sections (n ≥ 14) was determined (Fig￾ure 3A). In day 3 infections, maximum LS diameter ranged from 
5.0 to 8.4 μm, and the maximum LS area was 42.2 ± 9.6 μm2; at 
day 5, maximum LS diameter ranged from 17 to 26 μm, and the 
maximum LS area was 322 ± 71 μm2; and finally at day 7, maxi￾mum LS diameter ranged from 50 to–80 μm, and the maximum 
LS area was 3020 ± 730 μm2. These measurements demonstrate 
the remarkable growth acceleration during the final 2 days of LS 
development as well as the relative uniformity of LS schizont size 
at distinct developmental time points; the SD as a percentage 
of the mean was similar throughout development. Importantly, 
growth-retarded P. falciparum LSs, as often seen in in vitro culture, 
were never observed in day 7 FRG huHep infections.
To amplify P. falciparum transcripts using RT-PCR, RNA was 
isolated from infected liver tissue, reverse transcribed, and sub￾ject to amplification with oligonucleotide primers specific for 
human apoAI (hapoAI), mouse GAPDH (mGAPDH), and P. falci￾parum 18S rRNA. Parasites were detectable by RT-PCR at all time 
points of development, and amplification of transcribed parasite 
18S rRNA was greatest in day 7 infections compared with either 
day 5 or day 3 infections, proportional to the massive increase in 
parasite biomass (Figure 3B). To further analyze LS maturation, 
we amplified transcripts for 3 genes indicative of merozoite mat￾uration: MSP1, erythrocyte-binding antigen-175 (EBA-175), and 
apical membrane antigen-1 (AMA-1) (Figure 3C) at day 7 of infec￾tion. This is encouraging in that it not only implies that LS infec￾tion rates are high enough in the FRG huHep mice to produce 
sufficient transcript for amplification from whole infected tissue, 
but also that stage-appropriate transcripts are being expressed 
during LS maturation.
Ex vivo visualization of fluorescent P. falciparum LSs in the FRG huHep 
mouse. Previous analyses of rodent malaria LS transcriptomes 
and proteomes have relied on FACS of fluorescent parasites from 
hepatocytes isolated from perfused, collagenase-treated, infected 
livers (10). P. falciparum LS transcriptomic and proteomic analy￾ses would be invaluable for research into this life-cycle stage, and 
the FRG huHep mouse could be utilized for FACS of fluorescent 
P. falciparum LS. A fluorescent P. falciparum 3D7 transgenic parasite 
was recently created that expressed GFP under control of the EF1α
numbers of LS were observed (Figure 1E). IFA analysis also dem￾onstrated the lack of MSP1 expression in 3 and 5 day LS and the 
lack of CSP expression in 7 day LS (data not shown).
Previous studies using intravital microscopy of fluorescent 
rodent malaria LS (both P. berghei and P. yoelii) have shown that 
merozoites are frequently released from infected hepatocytes as 
merosomes: packets of multiple merozoites held together by a 
surrounding host hepatocyte-derived membrane (9, 29, 30). The 
rodent malaria merosomes bud off into the sinusoidal lumen and 
are carried in the bloodstream to the lung, where they burst, releas￾ing erythrocyte-infectious merozoites (29). However, it remains 
unknown whether this key feature of late LS development is con￾served in human malaria parasites. Here, we observed, for what we 
believe is the first time, budding of P. falciparum exoerythrocytic 
merozoite aggregates at day 7 after infection (Figure 2A), suggest￾ing that merosome formation is conserved in human malaria para￾sites and can be modeled in the FRG huHep mouse model. Individ￾ual, fully segregated merosomes that appeared to be surrounded 
by host hepatocyte–derived membrane were observed (Figure 2B), 
and individual merozoites were visualized within the mature LS as 
well as within the merosomes (Figure 2C). Merosomes sometimes 
stayed in close proximity to the mature LS and appeared to retain 
a narrow connection (Figure 2C). However, often, less organized 
release of merozoites from late LS into the adjacent tissue was 
seen, and these releases contained individual merozoites (Figure 
2D and Supplemental Figure 2). The full maturation of rodent 
malaria parasite LS in vitro and in vivo was shown to be accompa￾nied by the breakdown of the PVM (29, 31), and we also saw this

We next set out to determine the P. falciparum LS infection den￾sities in the FRG huHep mice and FRG NOD huHep mice and 
compared them with a rodent malaria/mouse combination — the 
P. yoelii parasite in the BALB/cJ mouse. Nonserial 50-μm liver slic￾es were analyzed by IFA for LS numbers, and these numbers were 
related to the areas of the liver slices and the numbers of sporozo￾ites injected. Calculations were made on 3 FRG huHep and FRG 
NOD huHep mouse livers (with huHep repopulation levels above 
80%) assayed at 7 days after injection of between 2 and 4 million 
P. falciparum sporozoites. The FRG huHep mouse was approxi￾mately 50% as susceptible to a P. falciparum LS infection (21 LS/cm2
50-μm liver section/106 sporozoites injected) as the BALB/cJ 
mouse was to P. yoelii LS infection (46 LS/cm2 50-μm liver sec￾tion/106 sporozoites injected), whereas LS infection in the FRG 
NOD huHep mouse, although robust, was lower (8 LS/cm2 50-μm 
liver section/106 sporozoites injected) (Figure 4B).
Complete P. falciparum LS development in the FRG NOD huHep mouse 
and transition from LS–to–blood-stage infection. Demonstrating the 
completion of P. falciparum LS development with formation of 
infectious exoerythrocytic merozoites and the subsequent transi￾tion to blood-stage infection is an important next step. Follow￾ing this transition in an animal model would further aid studies 
into the biology of late LS and exoerythrocytic merozoite infection 
of hurbc. Ultimately it might even allow for conducting parasite 
genetic crosses in a combined huHep/hurbc model. However, 
severe challenges have been encountered in the creation of immu￾nocompromised mice that can support human hematopoietic 
development through the xenotransplantation of human hemato￾poietic stem cells, and this is especially true for erythrocyte devel￾opment (33). The C57BL/6 background of the FRG huHep mouse 
does not support engraftment with hurbc, and this is partly due to 
the incompatibility of mouse macrophage–expressed signal regu￾latory protein α (SIRPα) with human CD47, which leads to the 
rapid clearance of hurbc by mouse macrophages (33, 34). A muta￾tion in the SIRPα gene in the NOD mouse prevents this incompat￾ibility, and thus, clearance of hurbc is reduced. We thus injected 
promoter throughout the life cycle (32). However, the P. falciparum
3D7 parasite line is not a robust gametocyte producer. Therefore, 
we recreated the transgenic parasite in the P. falciparum NF54 
parasite line. Blood stages, oocysts, and salivary gland sporozoites 
from this line (NF54HT-GFP) were fluorescent (data not shown). 
NF54HT-GFP sporozoites (2 million) were injected into a FRG 
huHep mouse, and 6 days later, the mouse was sacrificed. The liver 
was removed, and lobes were immediately sectioned ex vivo without 
fixation and analyzed by fluorescent microscopy. GFP-fluorescent 
LS parasites were readily visualized (Supplemental Figure 4A). IFA 
following fixation and sectioning of liver lobes also showed the 
robust expression of GFP in the day 6 LS (Supplemental Figure 4B).
Quantification of P. falciparum LS burden in the FRG huHep mouse and 
the level of LS infection in the FRG huHep and FRG NOD huHep mice. 
We tested to determine whether the level of huHep repopulation 
within the FRG huHep mouse liver correlated with LS burden. We 
reasoned that the higher the repopulation, the larger the LS bur￾den would be in any one part of the liver. Thus, on the same day, we 
injected 2 FRG huHep mice with approximately 80% repopulation 
with equal numbers of P. falciparum sporozoites (4 million) and 
sacrificed the mice at 7 days after injection. The mice were litter￾mates and had received the same donor hepatocytes on the same 
day, but varied in their total human albumin levels. Liver sections 
(between 16 and 21) were taken from multiple lobes, and RNA 
was isolated from each individual section. After DNase treatment 
and reverse transcription, equal amounts of cDNA from each sec￾tion were subjected to quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis of 
parasite burden (based on parasite 18S rRNA transcription) and 
humanization (based on a ratio of hapoAI transcripts to mGAPDH 
transcripts). This allowed us to plot LS biomass with the extent of 
humanization. LS burden directly correlated in a linear fashion to 
the degree of humanization in a given sample of liver tissue (Figure 
4A). The results also showed that once repopulation falls below a 
certain threshold, LS burden is undetectable, as demonstrated by 
a positive, non-zero X-intercept. Moreover, the slope of the best-fit 
line was similar for the 2 mice, suggesting reproducibility.

Correlation of LS burden with liver humanization in FRG huHep mice and comparison of LS density in P. falciparum–infected FRG huHep mice, 
FRG NOD huHep mice, and P. yoelii–infected BALB/cJ mice. (A) Liver tissue fragments (each point on the graph represents a single sample) 
taken from a 7-day LS infection of 2 FRG huHep mice (female littermates who received the same human donor hepatocytes) were analyzed by 
qRT-PCR for P. falciparum 18S rRNA burden (Pf 18S, arbitrary units) as well as the level of humanization based on the ratio of hapoAI transcripts 
relative to mGAPDH transcripts (arbitrary units). The results show a statistically significant, linear relationship (coefficient of determination, 
R2 = 0.87–0.89) between LS burden and liver humanization in the 2 mice. (B) The level of P. falciparum LS burden in the FRG huHep mouse 
was compared with that of the FRG NOD huHep mouse and P. yoelii rodent malaria LS burden in BALB/cJ mice. LS burden is shown as LS/cm2
50-μm liver section/106 sporozoites injected. Average LS counts per liver section were determined by analyzing at least 6 nonserial 50-μm liver 
sections from 3 individual mice. Humanized mice had huHep repopulation levels above 80%. The results show that the FRG huHep and FRG 
NOD huHep mice support robust P. falciparum LS infections. Data for B represent mean ± SD.

reproducible P. falciparum LS infection in FRG huHep and FRG 
NOD huHep mice will greatly accelerate studies on human malaria 
LS. Furthermore, that the parasites transition from LS to blood 
stage in a small animal model is, we believe, unprecedented and will 
allow studies into the liver-to-blood transition of human malaria 
parasites, epigenetics of the parasite throughout the life cycle, and 
other applications, such as conducting P. falciparum genetic crosses. 
Such crosses are currently only possible in chimpanzees, and thus 
few have been carried out (35). Although direct comparisons with 
the SCID Alb-uPA huHep mouse were not made in our study, the 
robustness of the FRG huHep mouse models and their ability to 
support reproducible transition from LS to a normal in vitro blood￾stage infection point to substantial advantages of these models.
Immunocompromised mice into which hurbc are continuously 
injected are able to support P. falciparum blood-stage infections, 
but the drawbacks are that the mice either have to be infected with 
adapted strains of P. falciparum (36) or continuously treated with 
clodronate liposomes to deplete macrophages (37). If the FRG 
NOD huHep mouse was also used for hurbc reconstitution, the 
clodronate depletion of the resident macrophages in the liver, the 
Kupffer cells, might have an effect on liver infection by sporozoites. 
A mouse reconstituted with a human hematopoietic system that 
produced its own hurbc would be ideal, but such models currently 
do not support stable hurbc production and maintenance (21).
Evidence for the robustness of the FRG huHep models and their 
utility for revealing new biological features of P. falciparum LS is 
based on growth observations of LS parasites at 3, 5, and 7 days 
after infection with P. falciparum sporozoites. LS expressed CSP at 
3 and 5 days of development, but ceased CSP expression late in 
development. We observed that the known blood-stage PV marker 
EXP-2 (26, 27) was expressed throughout LS development. Impor￾tantly, EXP-2 was recently shown to be a critical component of the 
PV translocon of exported proteins in P. falciparum blood stages 
where EXP-2 constitutes the potential pore through which para￾site proteins destined for the erythrocyte cytoplasm or erythrocyte 
FRG NOD huHep mice with P. falciparum sporozoites to ensure 
they were able to support complete LS development. Indeed, at 7 
days after sporozoite injection, mature LSs were seen in the livers 
of the mice, comparable to those observed in FRG huHep mice 
(Supplemental Figure 5).
We next explored whether the transition of the P. falciparum
LS infection to a blood-stage infection in the FRG NOD huHep 
mouse is possible. Six days after sporozoite injection, FRG NOD 
huHep mice were injected intravenously with hurbc and again 
on day 7 after sporozoite injection. Blood was removed from the 
mouse by cardiac puncture at day 7. The buffy coat was removed, 
and the blood was washed with standard in vitro P. falciparum cul￾ture medium, supplemented with an equal volume of hurbc, and 
cultured at 4% hematocrit. In 2 independent experiments with a 
total of 4 FRG NOD huHep mice, blood-stage parasites were con￾sistently detected by Giemsa-stained thin blood smears from 1 
to 5 days after the initiation of the in vitro culture. The parasites 
were subsequently maintained in continuous in vitro culture, and 
growth rates (Figure 5) were comparable to those of the parent 
NF54 strain used for mosquito infections and sporozoite produc￾tion. In addition, the mouse-derived asexual parasite cultures suc￾cessfully converted to produce gametocytes (Supplemental Figure 
6A), which when fed to mosquitoes, resulted in the production 
of oocysts (Supplemental Figure 6B). Furthermore, salivary gland 
sporozoite numbers between the NF54 strain routinely used for 
our mosquito infections and the humanized mouse-transitioned 
NF54 parasites were similar (data not shown).
Discussion
We have shown here that FRG huHep mice support complete 
development of P. falciparum LS. Furthermore, we have shown that 
LS development in the FRG NOD huHep mouse culminated in 
the release of exoerythrocytic merozoites that invaded hurbc and 
initiated sustainable asexual erythrocytic replication in vitro, an 
achievement that, to date, has not been documented. The robust,

in in vitro culture that were obtained from infected FRG NOD huHep 
mice 7 days after sporozoite injection is shown. Infected mice were 
injected with hurbc on day 6 and 7 after sporozoite injection to allow 
asexual erythrocytic infection. Parasite-infected blood was removed 
from the mice and placed in in vitro rbc culture. Humanized mouse 
infection-derived asexual blood-stage parasites from 3 individual FRG 
NOD huHep mice (white bars) and parent NF54 parasites (black bars) 
were assayed for growth over 4 days in triplicate. Giemsa-stained 
thin blood smears were assayed for percentage of parasitemia and 
also to demonstrate the presence of healthy parasites in the culture 
(inset, left panel, ring stage; middle panel, trophozoite; right panel, 
schizont). Black arrows point to infected cells. Blood-stage parasites 
derived from sporozoite-induced FRG NOD huHep mouse infections 
show normal in vitro growth characteristics. Scale bar: 10 μm. Data

analysis of drug efficacy in elimination of LS. The use of the FRG 
huHep mouse for assessing drug efficacy against LS is an attractive 
path, as it is more likely to correspond to actual clinical efficacy in 
humans. Drugs that target the P. falciparum LS will be metabolized 
in huHeps and the treatment will measure in vivo effects against 
the relevant human parasites.
The LS–to–blood-stage transition in the FRG NOD huHep 
mouse infections will also be useful in the analysis of P. falciparum
genetically attenuated strains (45). Immunizations with genetical￾ly attenuated rodent malaria parasites that arrest in LS develop￾ment induce potent sterilizing immune responses and completely 
protect against a subsequent wild-type sporozoite challenge (46), 
providing the rationale for testing attenuated P. falciparum strains 
in human vaccination (47). Work using the SCID Alb-uPA huHep 
mouse showed that a first generation genetically attenuated P. fal￾ciparum, the p52–p36– double-gene knockout (19), arrested early in 
LS development, similar to its P. yoelii counterpart (48), but ques￾tions remain as to the sensitivity of this model for detecting rare 
parasites that exhibit some growth and can lead to blood-stage 
infection. The FRG NOD huHep mouse might constitute a more 
sensitive model that can be used for such studies, since the LS–to–
blood-stage transition is achievable. This is particularly relevant 
when rodent malaria parasites cannot be used to evaluate gene 
knockouts; the P. falciparum genome contains many genes that are 
not present in rodent malaria species.
In summary, we have demonstrated that robust, biologically 
relevant P. falciparum LS development occurs in the FRG huHep 
and FRG NOD huHep mouse models, and the transition to blood￾stage infection is possible in the FRG NOD huHep mouse. These 
in vivo models of P. falciparum preerythrocytic infection are use￾ful for the study of drug interventions, parasite attenuation, and 
even innate immune responses to LS infection. This enables a 
great expansion of LS research with malaria parasites that infect 
humans. Equally important, the models could well provide unique 
opportunities for in vivo studies of P. vivax malaria, particularly 
the relapsing hypnozoite stages of this parasite.
Methods
FRG huHep and FRG NOD huHep mice. Female FRG huHep (on the C57BL/6 
background) (22) and FRG NOD huHep mice with human chimeric livers 
were purchased from Yecuris Corp. Backcrossing the FRG mouse (which is 
on the C57BL/6 background) to the NOD ShiLtJ mouse created the FRG 
NOD mouse. The FRG NOD mouse is as healthy as the FRG mouse, breeds 
as a homozygote, and is equally permissive to huHep chimerism as the 
FRG mouse. The FRG huHep and FRG NOD huHep mice were both sus￾ceptible to P. falciparum LS stage development (Yecuris Corp.).
All mice had human repopulation levels above 60%, and the majority 
of the mice used for this study had repopulation levels above 80%, which 
we found supported robust development of P. falciparum LS. Repopula￾tion levels are estimated based on the human serum albumin levels of the 
mouse, and over 100 animals have been used to correlate human serum 
albumin levels with human repopulation. To determine human serum 
albumin levels, blood samples from each repopulated mouse were col￾lected via the saphenous vein and analyzed using the Human Albumin 
ELISA Quantitation Set (Bethyl Laboratories) according to the manufac￾ture’s protocol, with slight modifications. We have determined that to 
achieve saturable binding and reproducible results, the incubation time 
for the binding of the standards and unknowns to the capture antibody 
must be increased from 1 to 2 hours. All other steps were performed as 
described in the manufacturer’s protocol. To determine the repopulation 
surface pass (28). It is currently unknown whether LSs employ a 
similar export mechanism, but our findings indicate that the pore￾forming component of the translocon is expressed in LS as well as 
a further component of the translocon, PTEX150. Thus, it is likely 
that the translocon is not unique to blood-stage parasites and in 
LS could serve to transport proteins into the infected hepatocyte 
cytoplasm. CSP was shown to be exported in rodent malaria LS 
(38), but we have, to date, seen no evidence for CSP export in the 
FRG huHep mouse infections. Thus, further work is needed to 
explore whether the PVM translocon is active in P. falciparum LS.
At day 7 of P. falciparum LS development, breakdown of the PVM 
occurred, as visualized by the disappearance of circumferential 
EXP-1 expression. PVM breakdown was previously shown to be a 
critical step in rodent malaria models preceding merozoite release 
(29–31). Furthermore, MSP1 protein expression as well as tran￾script abundance of the maturing merozoite markers MSP1, EBA￾175, and AMA-1 at 7 days of development suggested that complete 
LS development had occurred. Indeed, LS parasites were visualized 
that contained differentiated exoerythrocytic merozoites, each with 
individual nuclei. We also observed, for what we believe is the first 
time, the formation of merosomes in 7-day-old LSs, suggesting that 
P. falciparum shares this important feature with rodent malaria par￾asites for the delivery of merozoites to the bloodstream (9, 29, 30). 
The merosome is thought to prevent phagocytosis of the merozo￾ites as they leave the host hepatocyte and protect the merozoites as 
they journey to the bloodstream before finally being released in the 
pulmonary vasculature, whereupon they invade rbc (29). Thus, the 
FRG huHep and FRG NOD huHep mice support the entire devel￾opment of P. falciparum LS parasites, allowing accurate modeling of 
human preerythrocytic malaria parasite infections.
The relatively synchronous development and the immense bio￾mass of the late LS parasites seen in the FRG huHep mice, along 
with our evidence for exoerythrocytic merozoite formation and 
merosome release, shows how superior this in vivo model of devel￾opment is compared with current available in vitro models. The 
reported sizes of late P. falciparum LSs obtained from in vitro cul￾ture range from only 15 to 40 μm in diameter (6, 7, 39, 40), whereas 
we visualized LS sizes up to 80 μm in diameter, which, based on 
previous volume calculations (29), contain between 40,000 and 
60,000 merozoites. A small number of studies on P. falciparum LS 
development in humans have been undertaken (41, 42), and the 
size of 6 day LS ranged from 55 to 60 μm. A more complete micro￾scopic study of mature P. falciparum LS in the chimpanzee, which 
is susceptible to both P. falciparum preerythrocytic and blood-stage 
infections, has also been carried out, showing late LS measured 
from 60 to 100 μm in diameter (43). Thus, our studies show that 
LS development in the FRG huHep mice takes place with the 
dynamics and biomass amplification comparable to those seen 
in both human and chimpanzee infections. Furthermore, in vitro 
studies of P. falciparum LS development in primary hepatocytes 
have observed numerous small, growth-stunted LS forms up to 
11 days after infection (44). We never observed growth-stunted 
LS in the FRG huHep mice, indicating that in vitro development 
leads to LS artifacts (both depressed growth rate and presence of 
small LS forms) that are not found in in vivo infections. Since LS 
development appears to occur in a physiologically relevant manner 
and synchronously, the FRG huHep mouse should be an excel￾lent model for studying the effect of interventions on LS devel￾opmental progression. To support this, we have shown that LS 
burden is reproducibly quantifiable. This will enable quantitative

hypoxanthine and 10% A+ human serum in an atmosphere of 5% CO2, 5% 
O2, and 90% N2. Cells were subcultured into O+ erythrocytes. Gametocyte 
cultures were initiated at 5% hematocrit and 0.8%–1% parasitemia (mixed 
stages) and maintained for up to 17 days with daily medium changes.
Non–blood fed adult female mosquitoes 3 to 7 days after emergence 
were fed on gametocyte cultures. Gametocyte cultures were quickly spun 
down and the pelleted infected erythrocytes diluted to a 40% hematocrit 
with fresh A+ human serum and O+ erythrocytes. Mosquitoes were allowed 
to feed through Parafilm for up to 20 minutes. Following blood feeding, 
mosquitoes were maintained for up to 19 days at 27°C, 75% humidity, 
and provided with 8% dextrose solution in PABA water. Infection preva￾lence was checked at days 7–10 by examining dissected midguts under light 
microscopy for the presence of oocysts with salivary gland dissections per￾formed at days 14–19.
Creation of a P. falciparum NF54 line expressing GFP throughout the life cycle. A 
P. falciparum 3D7 transgenic parasite line expressing GFP under the con￾trol of the EF1α promoter has previously been created (32). The parasite 
line, named 3D7HT-GFP, expresses GFP throughout the life cycle under 
the constitutive EF1α promoter, and the transgene is integrated into the 
dispensable Pf47 locus. We wanted to create the same transgenic parasite in 
P. falciparum NF54, since gametocyte production in this line is more robust. 
Thus, the same plasmid used to create the 3D7HT-GFP line (pEFGFP) was 
transfected into P. falciparum NF54 to create NF54HT-GFP (Supplemental 
Figure 7A). Briefly, The NF54 line P. falciparum parasites were synchronized 
at ring stage with sorbitol 2 days prior to transfection. Transfection of 
P. falciparum ring stages with 100 μg of DNA was performed by electropora￾tion at 0.31 kV and 950 μF with a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser (Bio-Rad). Cultures 
were placed on the positive selection drug WR99210 (Jacobus Pharmaceuti￾cals) 6 hours after transfection and maintained in the culture at a final con￾centration of 5 nM. Drug-resistant parasites were subjected to successive 
rounds of on/off drug selection, and integration was confirmed by PCR. 
Individual clones of the NF54HT-GFP line were isolated by limiting dilu￾tion, and genotypic analysis was confirmed by PCR using the same primers 
(Supplemental Table 1) and methodology used to create 3D7HT-GFP (ref. 
32 and Supplemental Figure 7B). This NF54HT-GFP line was used solely to 
demonstrate ex vivo LS GFP fluorescence and complete LS development.
In vivo sporozoite infection and liver isolation. Mice were injected intrave￾nously into the tail vein with between 1 and 4 million P. falciparum NF54 
sporozoites in 100 μl of RPMI medium isolated from the salivary glands 
of infected mosquitoes. Mice were euthanized at 3, 5, 6, and 7 days after 
sporozoite infection. The liver was perfused with PBS through the hepatic 
portal vein, removed, and separated into lobes. Small pieces of liver from 
each lobe were added to Trizol (Invitrogen), homogenized, and stored at 
–80°C until used for RNA extraction. The remaining lobes were fixed in 
4% electron microscopy grade formaldehyde in PBS, which was replaced 
by TBS plus 0.05% (w/v) sodium azide after 24 hours. The fixed lobes were 
subsequently sliced into 50-μm sections for IFA, as detailed previously (12).
Indirect IFA of P. falciparum LSs. IFA was carried out as previously described 
(12) on liver sections isolated from mice with 3, 5, 6, and 7 day LS develop￾ment. huHeps were detected with a rabbit anti-FAH antibody (a gift from 
Yecuris Corp.). P. falciparum LS were detected with a CSP mouse monoclonal 
antibody, an EXP-2 mouse monoclonal antibody (27), a rabbit antibody to 
PF10_0164 (14) and a mouse monoclonal MSP1 antibody (MR4, ATCC), 
a rabbit antibody to PTEX150 antibody, and a rabbit antibody to EXP-1.
qRT-PCR. All oligonucleotide primers used in this study are detailed in 
Supplemental Table 1. Total RNA from liver lobe samples was extracted 
using Trizol (Invitrogen) and DNase treated using Turbo-DNA Free 
(Ambion). First-strand cDNA was synthesized from RNA using the Super￾script III Platinum RT Kit (Invitrogen). The resulting cDNA was used 
for the amplification of hapoAI, mGAPDH, and P. falciparum 18S rRNA, 
levels based on the results of the Human Albumin ELISA Quantitation Set, 
hepatocytes were isolated from FRG huHep and FRG NOD huHep mice 
by perfusion using collagenase and low-speed centrifugation, and then 
repopulation was measured in 1 of 2 ways. In the first method, the isolated 
hepatocytes were plated on collagen-coated dishes at 0.285 × 106 cells/cm2
and incubated at 37°C in 5% CO2 for 20–24 hours. The cells were rinsed 
twice with PBS, pH 7.2, and fixed for 10 minutes at room temperature with 
4% paraformaldehyde. After washing 3 times with PBS, pH 7.2, to remove 
the paraformaldehyde, the cells were blocked and permeabilized in PBS, 
pH 7.2, containing 0.1% Triton X-100 (v/v), and 0.25% (v/v) normal goat 
serum for 1 hour at room temperature. The hepatocytes were stained over￾night with a rabbit polyclonal FAH antibody (specific to the huHeps) and 
a mouse hepatocyte–specific rat monoclonal antibody in blocking buffer. 
The cells were washed 3 times with PBS, pH 7.2, and the primary antibodies 
were detected using goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 555 and donkey anti-rat 
Alexa Fluor 488 antibodies (Life Technologies). To identify all cells, a DNA￾specific Hoechst dye was added to the secondary antibody solution. Images 
of 5–6 fields for each fluorophore were captured using an EVOS fluores￾cent digital inverted microscope, and the numbers of cells were determined 
using ImageJ64 software. Human levels of repopulation were determined 
by dividing the FAH-positive cells by the total number of cells (FAH posi￾tive and mouse hepatocyte positive). In the second method for assessing 
repopulation, we used flow cytometry on hepatocytes isolated from FRG 
huHep and FRG NOD huHep mice to determine the repopulation indices. 
Briefly, approximately 400,000 hepatocytes isolated from a mouse were 
incubated with a human HLA ABC biotin–conjugated antibody (eBiosci￾ence) and a cocktail of mouse hepatocyte–specific rat monoclonal anti￾bodies (Oregon Stem Cell Center) for 1 hour on ice. The cells were washed 
and incubated in streptavidin-conjugated with APC (BD Biosciences) and 
goat anti-rat Alexa Fluor 555 for 1 hour on ice. Once again, the cells were 
washed and brought up in buffer containing propidium iodine to distin￾guish live from dead cells. The cells were analyzed on a BD FACSCalibur 
analyzer and the data evaluated using FlowJo software to determine the 
percentage of human versus mouse hepatocytes. To date, we have analyzed 
over 100 FRG huHep and FRG NOD huHep mice for human repopula￾tion using either or both of these methods. When the 2 methods were 
compared, they gave comparable results. With the data collected, we have 
determined the following range of repopulation based on human albumin 
levels in the mouse: human albumin of 2.0–3.0 mg/ml, 50%–70% repopula￾tion; 3.0–4.0 mg/ml, 70%–90% repopulation, and above 4.0 mg/ml, more 
than 90% repopulation. We realize that our correlation differs from those 
published by Bissig et al. (25), but we believe that with the ELISA proto￾col optimization we have implemented and the number of FRG huHep 
and FRG NOD huHep mice we have evaluated, our correlation of human 
albumin to replacement indices in the FRG huHep and FRG NOD huHep 
mice is accurate.
Mice used in the study were cycled on and off NTBC on a 2-week sched￾ule. In week 1, mouse water was supplemented with NTBC at 16 mg/l for 
3 days, 0.8 mg/l for 2 days, and then 0.2 mg/l for 2 days. The drug was 
then removed for week 2. This schedule continued until the end of the 
experiment.
P. falciparum sporozoite production. A. stephensi mosquitoes (originating 
from the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, Silver Spring, Maryland, 
USA) were maintained at 27°C and 75% humidity on a 12-hour light/12-
hour dark cycle. Larval stages were reared following standard protocols 
as described in the MR4 manual, with larval stages maintained on finely 
ground Tetramin fish food and adult mosquitoes maintained on 8% dex￾trose in 0.05% para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) water.
In vitro P. falciparum NF54 blood-stage cultures were maintained in 
RPMI 1640 (25 mM HEPES, 2 mM l-glutamine) supplemented with 50 μm

2 mM l-glutamine, 50 μM hypoxanthine, and 10% A+ human serum) in a 
24-well plate format. Triplicate samples of each culture (200 μl) were removed 
daily from individual wells for measurement of parasitemia. The rbc sample 
was pelleted by centrifugation at 200 g, smeared onto glass slides, and Giem￾sa-stained for microscopic evaluation of the percentage of parasitemia.
Statistics. Data are shown as mean ± SD. For linear regression model￾ing, the coefficient of determination, R2, was defined using the GraphPad 
Prism program.

MSP1, EBA-175, and AMA-1 cDNA. qPCR was carried out with SYBR 
green (Invitrogen) using the Applied Biosystems 7300 Real-Time PCR 
System and associated software. Relative copy numbers for the transcripts 
under study were calculated using the ΔΔCt method. Each qPCR used 
identical quantities of first-strand cDNA generated from small sections 
of each of the liver lobes of 2 FRG huHep mice. The mice were littermates 
and received the same donor hepatocytes on the same date and were also 
injected with P. falciparum sporozoites (4 million) on the same date.
Measurement of LS infectivity in FRG huHep and FRG NOD huHep mice. 
The level of P. falciparum LS infectivity of the FRG huHep and FRG NOD 
huHep mice was compared with that of the commonly studied P. yoelii
rodent malaria in the recipient BALB/cJ mouse and expressed as LS/cm2
50-μm liver section/106 sporozoites injected. Average LS counts per liver 
section were determined by analyzing at least 6 nonserial 50-μm liver sec￾tions from 3 individual mice (for the FRG huHep mice and FRG NOD 
huHep mice, all had human repopulation levels above 80%) by IFA using 
antibody to MSP1. The LS counts were normalized against the number of 
sporozoites injected. The P. yoelii/BALB/cJ combination gave results that 
are similar to those seen for the P. berghei/C57BL/6 combination (9).
LS–to–blood-stage transition and in vitro culture of blood stages derived from FRG 
NOD huHep mouse infections. Four FRG NOD huHep mice were injected 
intravenously with P. falciparum sporozoites. Six days after injection, mice 
were injected intravenously (400 μl) with packed O+ hurbc. The intrave￾nous injection was repeated on day 7. Two hours later, mice were sacrificed 
and blood was removed by cardiac puncture. The blood was added to 10 ml 
complete medium (RPMI 1640 with 25 mM HEPES, 2 mM l-glutamine, 
50 μM hypoxanthine, and 10% A+ human serum), pelleted by centrifuga￾tion at 200 g, and the supernatant along with the buffy coat (containing 
white blood cells) removed. The rbc were then washed 3 times with 10 ml 
complete medium, with pelleting and centrifugation as detailed above. 
After the third wash, an equal volume of packed O+ hurbc (approximately 
400 μl) was added, and the total rbc pellet was resuspended in complete 
medium to 2% hematocrit. Cultures were split equally into 6 wells of a 
6-well plate and maintained in an atmosphere of 5% CO2, 5% O2, and 90% 
N2. Cultures were fed daily and 50 μl of fresh packed hurbc were added 
every 5 days to each well. Once parasitemia reached 1%, serial dilutions of 
parasites were carried out to maintain healthy cultures.
Analysis of in vitro parasite growth in hurbc. Donor cultures were used at the 
greater than 94% ring stage to set up individual cultures at 0.5% parasitemia
