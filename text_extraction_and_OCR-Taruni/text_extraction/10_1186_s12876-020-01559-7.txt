Abstract
Background: Immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) associated autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) has been recognized as a type of 
autoimmune disease that responds to corticosteroid. The diagnosis is based on elevation of the serum IgG4 level, 
abundance of IgG4 enhanced plasma cell infiltration in the portal region of the liver, and satisfaction of the criteria for 
“definite AIH” under the revised International Autoimmune Hepatitis Group (IAIHG) scoring system. However, the clini￾cal course of the disease is unclear.
Case presentation: A 65-year-old man with jaundice and peripheral blood eosinophilia.His IAIHG and simplified 
score was compatible with definite AIH and his IgG4 level was elevated. Magnetic resonance imaging did not reveal 
abnormalities in the hepatobiliary system or pancreas. A liver biopsy revealed interface hepatitis with IgG4 positive 
plasma cell infiltration in the portal region, without evidence of bile duct injury. He responded to 4-week period of 
induction prednisolone therapy and had no recurring symptoms under maintenance therapy of 5mg prednisolone 
during the 3-year follow up.
Conclusions: This was a rare case that demonstrated an association between IgG4 associated AIH and the presence 
of peripheral blood eosinophilia.

Background
Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is an inflammatory liver 
disease characterized by chronic inflammation of the 
liver,positivity for autoantibodies, increased immuno￾globulin level, and histological evidence of interface hep￾atitis and lymphoplasmacytic infiltration [1]. In contrast, 
immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4)-related disease is a chronic, 
relapsing, systemic, fibro-inflammatory syndrome of 
presumed autoimmune etiology with high blood levels 
of IgG4, IgG, and IgE [2]. The association between high 
serum IgG4 level and high peripheral eosinophil count 
has been proved; peripheral blood and tissue eosino￾philia have been observed in some IgG4-related-disease 
patients [3]. Recently, AIH with an elevated serum IgG4 
concentration and an abundance of IgG4-positive plasma 
cell infiltration in the liver was proposed to be termed 
“IgG4 associated AIH” and regarded as a subtype of 
IgG4-related disease [4]. However, there are few reported 
cases of IgG4 associated AIH (IgG4-AIH), and the clini￾cal course of this disease remains poorly understood. 
Here, we report an interesting case of a patient with

peripheral blood eosinophilia who was diagnosed with 
IgG4-AIH and review the literature on this topic.
Case presentation
A 64-year-old man presented with a 2-month history 
of progressive, painless jaundice, loss of appetite, and a 
recent weight loss of 6-kg. He reported a history of unin￾vestigated, self-limited jaundice with prodromal symp￾toms occurring 2years before. His past medical history 
was negative for peripheral mononeuropathy as well as 
allergic disease, including allergic rhinitis, sinusitis, and 
bronchial asthma. He was a non-smoker and did not 
consume alcohol/supplements/herbals. He also denied 
previous or ongoing use of drugs. Physical examination 
was unremarkable except for signs of jaundice and body 
itching. Complete blood count findings were remark￾able for an elevated absolute eosinophil count (AEC) of 
2592 cells/μL. Blood chemistry findings included serum 
total protein, 11.71g/dL; serum albumin, 2.54g/dL; total 
bilirubin, 8.10mg/dL; direct bilirubin, 6.48mg/dL, serum 
aspartate aminotransferase (AST), 385IU/L; alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT), 429 IU/L; alkaline phosphatase 
(ALP), 123IU/L; and prothrombin time-international 
normalized ratio, 1.11.  Serologic tests were negative for 
infection with Human Immunodeficiency Virus as well 
as hepatitis A, B, C or E. The patient’s autoantibody test￾ing (using indirect immunofluorescent method) showed 
anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) was positive with titer 
at 1:80  and cytoplasmic pattern while smooth muscle 
antibody (SMA), anti-mitochondrial antibody and anti￾neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies were negative. The 
patient’s serum IgG concentration level was 5222mg/
dL (reference range: 548–1768mg/dL), and his IgG4 
concentration level was 1780mg/dL (reference range: 
3.9–86.4mg/dL). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 
revealed no abnormalities in the hepatobiliary system or 
pancreas.
A percutaneous ultrasound-guided liver biopsy was 
performed (Fig. 1). The pathology results revealed inter￾face hepatitis and bridging necrosis together with severe 
lymphoplasmacytic cell infiltration, of which most were 
positive for IgG4 immunostaining (more than 40 IgG4-
positive plasma cells/ high power field) in the portal 
region, with a ratio of IgG4/IgG positive plasma cells 
greater than 40%. Eosinophilic infiltration was detected 
with more than 10 cells/high power field. No evidence 
of bile duct destruction, granuloma, broad collapse or 
necrotizing vasculitis was noted. Definite AIH was diag￾nosed based on the patient’s pretreatment revised Inter￾national Autoimmune Hepatitis Group (IAIHG) score 
of 17 [5] and the simplified AIH score of 8 [6]. Periph￾eral blood eosinophilia was diagnosed based on an ele￾vated absolute eosinophil count more than 500cells/μL. 
Initially, the patient was successfully treated with 40mg 
of prednisolone daily for 4weeks. At his 4-week follow￾up visit, the patient exhibited no signs of jaundice, and 
his liver function tests, and blood eosinophil count even￾tually normalized. After steroid dose tapering, he con￾tinued taking prednisone 5mg daily to prevent disease 
recurrence. He decided to receive lifelong prednisolone 
without undergoing second liver biopsy for disease activ￾ity evaluation. His illness did not recur under mainte￾nance therapy of 5mg prednisolone during the 3-year 
follow up. His main laboratory results at presentation 
and during treatment are shown in Table 1.
Discussion
The IgG4-related disease has recently been defined as a 
systemic, chronic, relapsing, multiorgan, fibroinflamma￾tory condition. It commonly involves the pancreas, bil￾iary tract, salivary glands, lacrimal glands, and kidneys 
[2]. The hepatic manifestations of IgG4-related disease 
are heterogenous and remain unclear [7].
However, it has recently been postulated that there is 
an association between IgG4-related disease and auto￾immune hepatitis, and this has given rise to the disease 
concepts known as “IgG4 hepatopathy” [4] and “IgG4 
associated autoimmune hepatitis” [8]. According to 
Nakanuma et  al., these two types of IgG4-related liver 
disease can be distinguished clinicopathologically [9]. 
IgG4 hepatopathy is a collective term for hepatic lesions 
primarily or secondarily related to sclerosing cholangitis 
and autoimmune pancreatitis; relevant histological find￾ings include portal inflammation, interface hepatitis, lob￾ular hepatitis, large bile duct obstruction, and canalicular 
cholestasis [10]. In contrast, IgG4-AIH is clinicopatho￾logically similar to AIH except for marked infiltration of 
IgG4-positive plasma cells in the liver tissue and elevated 
serum levels of IgG4 [8]. However, agreed-upon diagnos￾tic criteria have not yet been established. The previously 
published literature indicates that an IgG4-AIH diagnosis 
may be based on three features: (1) a finding of “definite 
AIH” according to the IAIHG scoring system, (2) a serum 
IgG4 concentration level of at least 135mg/dL, and (3) 
an IgG4-expressing plasma cell infiltration of at least 10 
cells/high power field in the portal tract [8]. Our patient 
met all these criteria: his IAIHG score indicated “defi￾nite AIH”; his IgG4 level was high, and he had an IgG4/
IgG-positive cell ratio greater than 40%. In addition, the 
findings typical of pancreatic lesion/sclerosing cholan￾gitis were not seen on MRI, nor was there any evidence 
of portal sclerosis or liver cholestasis. For these reasons, 
the patient was diagnosed with IgG4-AIH and not IgG4 
hepatopathy.
An important question is whether IgG4-AIH is a sub￾type of classic AIH or a subtype of IgG4-related disease 

Chang et al. BMC Gastroenterol (2020) 20:420 Page 3 of 5
that involved liver. Previous reports suggest that IgG4-
AIH should be differentiated from classic AIH [8]. Most 
baseline biochemical and autoantibody laboratory values 
do not help distinguish between IgG4-AIH and classic 
AIH. In contrast, serum concentration levels of both IgG 
and IgG4 are significantly higher in patients with IgG4-
AIH than in those with classic AIH [8, 11]. Histological 
finding of eosinophilic infiltrate is not a characteristic 
feature of IgG4-AIH because this could be detected in 
patients with both group [8]. Both conditions respond 
dramatically to glucocorticoid therapy. The long-term 
response to glucocorticoid therapy is comparable for 
each situation; however, the alanine aminotransferase 
normalization time after initiation of such treatment is 
shorter in IgG4-AIH patients [10]. Chung et al. proposed 
that the degree of accumulation of IgG4-positive liver 
cells is associated with the serum IgG4 response in 
patients with IgG4-AIH [11]. Furthermore, synchronous 
or metachronous development of other IgG4-related dis￾ease is observed in most cases of IgG4-AIH [9, 12–15]. 
This evidence suggests that IgG4-AIH is a hepatic mani￾festation of IgG4-related disease and, while sharing path￾ological findings with AIH, is not a subtype of classic AIH 
[9]. To our knowledge, this is the second reported case of 
IgG4-AIH, which had only hepatitis after those reported 
by Umemura et al. [16].
Another important aspect of our case was the pres￾ence of peripheral blood eosinophilia and the abundance 
of eosinophilic infiltration in the biopsied liver speci￾men. IgG4 and IgE share a common immune response 
Fig. 1 Photographs of liver biopsy demonstrates (a) The portal tract expanded by severe inflammatory cell infiltration, consisting of lymphocytes 
and plasma cells (H&E×100); (b) A moderate number of eosinophils and histiocytes, with interface hepatitis and bridging necrosis, are present; no 
florid duct lesion or broad collapse is clearly seen (H&E×400); (c) Immunostaining for IgG4 demonstrates that most plasma cells are marked with 
IgG4, with more than 40 positive plasma cells/high power field; (d) Immunohistochemical staining with CK7 revealed a moderate number of central 
and peripheral bile ducts without evidence of destruction (lumen ×200)

pathway. Allergic immunology triggers T-helper 2-type 
immune response that promotes secretion of IgG4 and 
IgE and induces peripheral blood and tissue eosinophilia 
[17]. There are data supporting a positive association 
between IgG4 and both IgE and peripheral eosinophil 
count [18]. Further, peripheral blood and tissue eosino￾philia have been observed in some cases of IgG4-related 
disease [8]. Moreover, the histologic features of IgG4-
related disease often involve increased eosinophil infil￾tration [2]. Although serum IgE levels were not obtained 
in this case, our finding of peripheral blood and tissue 
eosinophilia could be explained by the presence of IgG4-
related disease. In a recent study by Mohapatra et al. [3], 
it was shown that peripheral eosinophilia increased as 
serum IgG4 increased. This finding was consistent with 
a recently reported case of IgG4-AIH with the laboratory 
of IgG4 level is remarkably high (3560mg/dL) presenting 
as idiopathic hypereosinophilia syndrome (AEC 17,940 
cells/μL) [19]. The author concluded that having periph￾eral eosinophilia may correspond with having a higher 
level of serum IgG4. These data are consistent with our 
findings: our patient had an extremely high level of serum 
IgG4 (1780mg/dL) along with significant peripheral 
eosinophilia (an absolute eosinophil count of 2592 cells/
μL). However, the utility of peripheral eosinophilia as a 
tool for diagnosing IgG4-related disease requires further 
investigation.
In conclusion, we report a rare case of IgG4-AIH with 
peripheral blood eosinophilia and absence of symp￾toms related to other organ of IgG4-related disease. The 
identification of “Definite AIH” based on both IAIHG 
and simplified AIH score, high serum IgG4 level, and 
an accumulation of IgG4-positive cells in the liver were 
necessary for our diagnosis. Glucocorticoid treatment 
is the first line treatment for this condition and, in our 
patient, produced a good response. Although the pres￾ence of peripheral eosinophilia may possibly help diag￾nose this disease, further studies are needed to confirm 
this and to clarify the clinical course and optimal treat￾ment of IgG4-AIH.
