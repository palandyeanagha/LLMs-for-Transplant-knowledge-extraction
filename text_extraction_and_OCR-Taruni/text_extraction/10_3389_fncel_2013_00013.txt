Neurogenesis in the adult rodent brain is largely restricted to the subependymal zone
(SVZ) of the lateral ventricle and subgranular zone (SGZ) of the dentate gyrus (DG). We
examined whether cholecystokinin (CCK) through actions mediated by CCK1 receptors
(CCK1R) is involved in regulating neurogenesis. Proliferating cells in the SVZ, measured by
5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU) injected 2 h prior to death or by immunoreactivity against
Ki67, were reduced by 37 and 42%, respectively, in female (but not male) mice lacking
CCK1Rs (CCK1R−/−) compared to wild-type (WT). Generation of neuroblasts in the SVZ
and rostral migratory stream (RMS) was also affected, since the number of doublecortin
(DCX)-immunoreactive (ir) neuroblasts in these regions decreased by 29%. In the SGZ
of female CCK1R−/− mice, BrdU-positive (+), and Ki67-ir cells were reduced by 38 and
56%, respectively, while DCX-ir neuroblasts were down 80%. Subsequently, the effect
of reduced SVZ/SGZ proliferation on the generation and survival of mature adult-born
cells in female CCK1R−/− mice was examined. In the OB granule cell layer (GCL), the
number of neuronal nuclei (NeuN)-ir and calretinin-ir cells was stable compared to WT,
and 42 days after BrdU injections, the number of BrdU+ cells co-expressing GABA- or
NeuN-like immunoreactivity (LI) was similar. Compared to WT, the granule cell layer of the
DG in female CCK1R−/− mice had a similar number of calbindin-ir cells and BrdU+ cells
co-expressing calbindin-LI 42 days after BrdU injections. However, the OB glomerular layer
(GL) of CCK1R−/− female mice had 11% fewer NeuN-ir cells, 23% less TH-ir cells, and a
38% and 29% reduction in BrdU+ cells that co-expressed TH-LI or GABA-LI, respectively.
We conclude that CCK, via CCK1Rs, is involved in regulating the generation of proliferating
cells and neuroblasts in the adult female mouse brain, and mechanisms are in place to
maintain steady neuronal populations in the OB and DG when the rate of proliferation is
altered.

INTRODUCTION
Adult olfactory precursors divide primarily within the subven￾tricular or subependymal zone (SVZ) of the lateral ventricle,
where they differentiate into immature neurons. Neuroblasts then
migrate tangentially along the rostral migratory stream (RMS)
toward the main olfactory bulb (OB) (Curtis et al., 2007). When
neuroblasts reach the OB, they migrate radially into the gran￾ular (GCL) and periglomerular (GL) layers of the OB, where
they differentiate into local interneurons (Luskin, 1993; Lois and
Alvarez-Buylla, 1994). In the dentate gyrus (DG), neural pro￾genitors in the subgranular zone (SGZ) proliferate and give rise
to immature neurons (Altman and Das, 1965; Eriksson et al.,
1998; Van Praag et al., 2002) that migrate a short distance to the
granule cell layer (GrDG), where they functionally integrate into
hippocampal circuitry (Kempermann et al., 2003).
In the young adult rodent, approximately 50% of adult-born
cells that migrate into the OB differentiate to form interneurons
that integrate into OB circuitry, while the other half undergo
programmed cell death as progenitors, neuroblasts or young
neuronal cells in the SVZ, RMS, or OB (Petreanu and Alvarez￾Buylla, 2002; Winner et al., 2002; Lledo and Saghatelyan, 2005).
Doublecortin (DCX), a neuron specific microtubule associated
protein, is expressed by most dividing neuroblast cells and migrat￾ing postmitotic neuroblasts in the SVZ and RMS, and its down￾regulation 10–14 days after the birth of a neuroblast coincides
with the commencement of neuronal nuclei (NeuN) expression,

CELLULAR NEUROSCIENCE

Sui et al. CCK1 receptors influence neurogenesis
as the cells mature to become OB interneurons (Brown et al.,
2003). Similarly, 50% of newly generated cells in the adult rodent
GrDG die within 22 days of their birth (Dayer et al., 2003). DCX
is expressed by adult-born cells on days 1–14 after birth (Brown
et al., 2003), with some cells being NeuN-positive (+) on day 1
(Brandt et al., 2003), and the majority of surviving cells express￾ing NeuN (Brown et al., 2003) and calbindin (Brandt et al., 2003)
1 month after birth.
A wide range of molecular cues regulate neurogenesis in the
adult brain (Lie et al., 2004; Abrous et al., 2005; Emsley et al.,
2005; Ming and Song, 2005), and peptidergic systems, includ￾ing neuropeptide Y (Hansel et al., 2001; Howell et al., 2005;
Hökfelt et al., 2008; Stanic et al., 2008 ´ ) and galanin (Mazarati
et al., 2004), also participate in these processes. A neuropep￾tide that has remained largely unexplored within this context,
and which may potentially regulate neurogenesis, is cholecys￾tokinin (CCK). CCK is widely distributed in the mammalian CNS
(Vanderhaeghen et al., 1975; Hökfelt et al., 1988) and so far two
distinct CCK receptors have been cloned; the CCK 1 (CCK1R)
and CCK 2 receptor (Hill et al., 1987; Wank et al., 1992). CCK
modifies the migratory abilities, proliferation, and survival of
tumor astrocytes (De Hauwer et al., 1998; Lefranc et al., 2002)
and lymphocytes (Medina et al., 1998), and guides migrating
gonadotropin-releasing hormone-1 (GnRH-1) neuroendocrine
neurons into the brain (Giacobini et al., 2004). Moreover, immor￾talized rat brain neuroblasts express CCK1R and CCK2R mRNA
(Langmesser et al., 2007). Exposure to CCK promoted prolifer￾ation of these cells, and improved their viability, indicating that
CCK is an important regulator of proliferation.
We therefore examined whether CCK is involved in regulat￾ing neurogenesis in the adult brain. Using adult mice with genetic
deletion of the CCK1 receptor (CCK1R−/−), we investigated
whether CCK1 receptors influence cell proliferation and neurob￾last formation in the SVZ, RMS, and SGZ, and affect interneuron
generation in the OB and DG. We report that female, but not
male, CCK1R−/− mice have fewer proliferating cells, migratory
neuroblasts, and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-immunoreactive (ir)
OB interneurons than wild-type (WT) mice.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
ANIMALS
All experimental procedures conformed to the Australian
National Health and Medical Research Council published code
of practice, and were approved by the Florey Neuroscience
Institutes’ Animal Ethics Committee (#09-053 and #07-117).
Twelve female and four male 16–20-week old mice lacking the
CCK1R (Strain Name: 129-Cckartm1Kpn/J; Stock No. 006367; The
Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) (Kopin et al., 1999) and
12 female and 4 male age-matched WT control mice, weighing
between 20–25 g were used. All animals were maintained under
standard conditions on a 12 h day/night cycle, with water and
food ad libitum.
GENOTYPING
To obtain genomic DNA, 2–5 mm mouse tails were digested in
100μL proteinase K solution (250μL Tween 20, 500μL 1M Tris,
2500μL × 20 mg/ml proteinase K and MQ water to 50 ml).
Mixtures were then incubated at 56◦C for 60–90 min, followed
by 10 min at 95◦C. Tubes were centrifuged at maximum speed
for 10 min, and subsequently stored at 4◦C. For each PCR,
1 μl DNA template was added to 6μl 2×Go Taq Green poly￾merase master mix (Promega, Madison, WI, Code No. 9PIM712),
1 μl of 10 μM mixture of each primer and 4 μl nuclease free
water (Promega, Code No. P1193). PCR was performed on a
T3 Thermocycler (Biometra, Göttingen, Germany) with the fol￾lowing primer sequences (Geneworks, Hindmarsh, Australia):
5
-GCT GCA TAG CGT CAC TTG G-3 for CCK1 receptor WT
forward; 5
-GAT GGA GTT AGA CTG CAA CC-3 for CCK1
receptor WT reverse; 5
-GAC AAT CGG CTG CTC TGA TG￾3 for CCK1R−/− forward. Cycling conditions were: 95◦C for
5 min for initial denaturation, 35 cycles of 95◦C for 30 s, 63◦C
for 60 s, and 72◦C for 60 s, followed by final amplification at 72◦C
for 5 min. Final DNA products were visualized under UV after
electrophoresis in 1.5% agarose gel containing 0.5μL SYBR Safe
DNA gel stain (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, Code No. S33102) per
10 ml. The expected fragments yielded by PCR were 507 bp for
WT, 970 + 507 bp for CCK1R ± and 970 bp for CCK1R−/−.
BrdU ADMINISTRATION
5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU) (ICN Biomedicals Inc, Aurora,
OH, Cat No. 100171) was administered intraperitoneally to
CCK1R−/− and WT mice to study the proliferation and survival
of adult-born cells in the SVZ, OB and DG of the hippocam￾pal formation. Two different protocols were used to identify
either proliferating cells in the SVZ and SGZ, or “mature” cells
that had survived or integrated into the OB or GrDG: (1) To
enable identification of proliferating cells in the SVZ/SGZ, a sin￾gle dose of BrdU (150 mg/kg, i.p.) was injected 2 h prior to their
death (Figure 1A); and (2) To label mature adult-born cells that
migrate to, integrate and survive in the GCL, GL or GrDG, BrdU
(50 mg/kg, i.p.) was administered twice daily for 5 consecutive
days, and mice killed 42 days later (Figure 1B).
TISSUE PREPARATION
All animals were deeply anaesthetized using pentobarbitone
sodium (Lethabarb, Virbac, Milperra, NSW, Australia, 100 mg/kg
i.p.) and perfused through the heart via the ascending aorta with
20 ml Ca2+-free Tyrode’s buffer (37◦C), followed by 20 ml of a
mixture of 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO)
and 0.2% picric acid (Sigma) diluted in 0.16 M phosphate buffer
(pH 6.9, 37◦C) (Pease, 1962; Zamboni and De Martino, 1967)
and 50 ml of the same fixative at 4◦C, the latter for approximately
5 min. The brains were dissected out and postfixed in the same
fixative for 90 min at 4◦C, and finally immersed for 48 h at 4◦C in
10% sucrose dissolved in phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4)
containing 0.01% sodium azide (Sigma) and 0.02% bacitracin
(Sigma), before rapid freezing by CO2. Sections were cut using
a cryostat (Leica CM1850, Wetzlar, Germany) at: (1) a thickness
of 14 microns, and thaw-mounted on slides coated with 0.5%
gelatin (Sigma) and 0.05% chromium(III) potassium sulphate
dodecahydrate (Merck, KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany); or (2) a
thickness of 30 microns, and stored in a cyroprotectant solution
[30% v/v ethyleneglycol (Merck); 15% w/v sucrose; 35% v/v 0.1 M
phosphate buffer; 35% v/v distilled H2O], at −20◦C.

FIGURE 1 | BrdU Experimental Design. (A) Protocol 1. To identify
proliferating cells in the SVZ and SGZ, a single dose of BrdU (150 mg/kg
i.p.) was administered 2 h prior to death (n = 4 for each experimental
group). From these animals, the number of BrdU+ cell bodies in the
SVZ (Figures 2D,E) and SGZ (Figures 6A–C) was estimated. (B)
Protocol 2. To label mature adult-born cells that migrate to, integrate
and survive in the GCL and GL of the OB, and the GrDG of the
hippocampal formation, BrdU (50 mg/kg, i.p.) was administered twice
daily for 5 consecutive days, and mice killed 42 days later (i.e., 47 days
after first BrdU administration; n = 4 for each experimental group).
From these animals, the number of BrdU+ cell bodies in the GCL
(Figures 4A,B) and GL (Figures 5A,B) of the OB was estimated, as
was the number of: BrdU/GABA (Figures 4C–E), BrdU/NeuN
(Figures 4G–I), and BrDU/calretinin (Figures 4J–L) co-expressing
cells in the GCL of the OB; BrdU/TH (Figures 5C–F), BrdU/GABA
(Figures 5G–I), and BrdU/calbindin (Figures 5J–L) co-expressing cells in
the GL; BrdU+ cells in the GrDG (Figures 6P–R); and BrdU/calbindin
co-expressing cells in the GrDG (Figures 6S–W).
IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY
Incubation protocol (immunofluorescence)
Sections were washed using 0.01 M PBS (3 × 10 min) and incu￾bated for 24 h at 4◦C with a rat anti-BrdU (1:300, Axyll, Westbury,
NY, Code No. OBT0030), rabbit anti-calbindin (1:10,000, Swant,
Marly, Switzerland, Code No. CB-38a), goat anti-calretinin
(1:4000, Swant, Code No. CG1), goat anti-DCX (1:1000, Santa
Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, Code No. SC-8066), rab￾bit anti-γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) (1:2000, Sigma, Code No.
A2052), rabbit anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) (1:400,
Dako, Glostrup, Denmark, Code No. Z0334), mouse anti-NeuN
(1:1000, Millipore, Billerica, MA, Code No. MAB377), rab￾bit anti-tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) (1:1000, Pel-Freeze, Rogers,
Ar, Code No. P40101-0) or sheep anti-TH (1:400, Pel-Freeze,
Code No. P60101-0) antibody, diluted in 0.01 M PBS contain￾ing 0.3% Triton X-100 and 0.5% BSA. Sections were then
washed in TNT buffer [0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.5; 0.15 M NaCl;
0.05% Tween 20 (Sigma)] for 15 min and incubated in TNB
buffer [0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.5; 0.15 M NaCl; 0.5% block￾ing reagent (PerkinElmer, Boston, MA, Code No. FP1020)] for
30 min at room temperature (RT). Immunoreactivity was visual￾ized using Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated goat anti-rat, Alexa Fluor
488-conjugated donkey anti-goat, Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated
goat anti-rabbit, Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit,
Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated goat anti-mouse or Alexa Fluor
488-conjugated donkey anti-sheep (1:200, Molecular Probes,
Eugene, OR), as appropriate, in TNB buffer for 2 h. Finally, sec￾tions were washed in TNT (3 × 10 min) and coverslipped using
a fluorescent mounting medium (Dako). Hoechst 33342 (1:1000,
Invitrogen) was applied to sections immunostained with GFAP
for 1.5 min during the third TNT wash, to provide a nuclear
counter stain. Prior to commencing immunoreactivity for BrdU,
antigen retrieval and DNA denaturation was performed, where
sections were incubated in 50% formamide (BDH Laboratory
Supplies, England) in 0.01 M PBS at 65◦C for 2 h, 2 M HCl for
30 min at 37◦C, and 0.1 M sodium borate (Borax, Sigma, B-3545)
buffer for 10 min at RT.
To visualize calbindin and calretinin immunoreactivity, sec￾tions were processed using a commercial kit (TSA+, NEN Life
Science Products, Inc., Boston, MA). Briefly, following 24 h
incubation in primary antisera, sections were washed in TNT
buffer (15 min), incubated with TNB buffer (30 min) and incu￾bated with horse-radish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated swine
anti-rabbit (1:200, Dako) or HRP-conjugated donkey anti-goat
(1:500, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA),
as appropriate, diluted in TNB buffer for 30 min. Sections

Sui et al. CCK1 receptors influence neurogenesis
were then washed in TNT buffer (3 × 10 min) and incubated
in a biotinyl tyramide-fluoroscein (BT-FITC) conjugate (NEN)
diluted 1:100 in amplification diluent for 10 min at RT, followed
by washes in TNT (3 × 10 min).
For double-immunofluorescence experiments, antigen
retrieval and DNA denaturation was performed first, followed
by incubations of the anti-BrdU and either the anti-calbindin,
calretinin, DCX, GABA, NeuN, or TH antibodies, according to
the above concentrations and protocols.
Incubation protocol [diaminobenzidine (DAB)]
Sections were rinsed (3 × 10 min) in 0.01 M PBS, followed by
incubation in blocking diluent [0.01 M PBS containing 5% nor￾mal goat serum (NGS) and 0.3% Triton X-100 (Sigma)] for
30 min, and rabbit anti-Ki67 antibody (1:15,000, Thermo Fisher
Scientific, Fremont, CA, Code No. RM-9106-s1) diluted in 0.01 M
PBS, 1% NGS and 0.3% Triton X-100 for 48 h at 4◦C. Sections
were then incubated in biotinylated goat anti-rabbit (1:1000,
Dako) diluted in 0.01 M PBS, 1% NGS and 0.3% Triton X-100 for
3 h at RT, and then avidin peroxidase (1:5000 in 0.01 M PBS and
0.075% Triton X-100) for 1 h, followed by DAB (1:100, Sigma) for
20 min. Three percent Hydrogen peroxidase (Merck) was added
to the DAB solution for substrate precipitation and the reac￾tion terminated 2 min later by rinsing sections in 0.01 M PBS.
Sections were counter stained with neutral red, dehydrated in a
series of graded ethanol (50–100%), cleared in X3B solvent (Shell
Chemicals, Hawthorn East, Australia), and then coverslipped
with DePeX (VWR International, Poole, England). Rinses using
0.01 M PBS (3 × 10 min) were performed between each step.
IMAGE PROCESSING
After processing, sections were examined using a Leica DMLB2
fluorescence microscope (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany), equipped
with a dark field condenser and epi-polarization, and epifluo￾rescence with appropriate filter combinations, and with objective
lenses of ×10 (N.A. 0.45), ×20 (N.A. 0.70), ×40 (N.A. 0.75),
×60 oil (N.A. 1.40), and ×100 oil (N.A. 1.30). Photographs were
taken using a Microfire digital camera (2.3A, Optronics, Goleta,
CA) attached to the microscope, operated through Picture Frame
software (v2.3, Optronics). For confocal analysis, an Olympus
FV1000 confocal laser scanning microscope equipped with ×10
(N.A. 0.4), ×20 (N.A. 0.75), ×40 oil (N.A. 1.30) and ×60
oil (N.A. 1.35) objectives was used. The AlexaFluor 488 and
FITC labeling was excited using the 473 nm diode laser. For the
detection of AlexaFluor 594, a 559 nm diode laser was used.
Z-stack images were captured with multiple images, each sep￾arated by a stepwise depth of 1.0 um in the z-plane. Digital
images from the microscopy were slightly modified to opti￾mize for image resolution, brightness and contrast using Adobe
Photoshop CS5 software (Adobe Systems Inc., San Jose, CA), so
as to best represent the immunohistochemistry observed at the
microscope.
STEREOLOGY
For quantification of cell bodies in the SVZ and RMS, the level
at which the anterior commissure (AC) converged through the
midline [Bregma +0.14 mm (see Paxinos and Franklin, 2001)]
was used as a reference to define the caudal boundary of the SVZ.
Serial sections rostral to this point were acquired, with sections
between 0–1400μm rostral to the AC convergence (i.e., Bregma
+0.14 to +1.54 mm) defined as containing the SVZ, and sections
from 1500 to 4100μm (i.e., Bregma +1.6 to +4.2 mm) regarded
as having the RMS. Analysis of the OB was performed on sec￾tions rostral to Bregma +2.6 mm. Fourteen μm-thick sections,
each 280μm apart, were analysed, and guard zones of 1μm (top)
and 1 μm (bottom) were employed. For quantification of prolif￾erating cells and neuroblasts in SVZ, only the lateral wall of the
lateral ventricle was analyzed, as these cells are largely absent in
the medial and dorsal walls (Doetsch et al., 1997).
Regions of the DG from which cell bodies were quantified
corresponded to Bregma −1.30 to −3.10 mm (see Paxinos and
Franklin, 2001). DCX-ir and Ki67-ir cell bodies in the SGZ/GrDG
were counted on 14 μm-thick sections, each 140μm apart, and
GFAP-ir and calbindin-ir cell bodies on 14 μm-thick sections,
each 280μm apart. BrdU+ in the SGZ/GrDG, and BrdU+
cell bodies expressing calbindin-like immunoreactivity (LI), were
quantified on 30μm-thick free floating sections, each 180μm
apart, with guard zones of 1μm (top and bottom). For quantifi￾cation of Ki67-ir and BrdU-positive proliferating cells in the SGZ,
the SGZ was recognized as the border between the polymorph
and granule cell layers of the DG, including one cell body width
of the GrDG and the equivalent of two granule cell body widths
within the polymorph layer (Cameron and McKay, 2001).
Estimates of the number of proliferating cells, neuroblasts and
mature neurons in the SVZ, RMS, OB, and DG were made using
a fractionator sampling design according to optical dissector rules
(Gundersen et al., 1988; West et al., 1991; Stanic et al., 2003; Parish
et al., 2005). Regular predetermined x, y intervals and counting
frame dimensions for all estimates were derived by means of a grid
program (Stereoinvestigator v.7.0, MicroBrightField, Williston,
VT, viewed through a microscope, Leica) and are outlined in
Table 1.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 4 (GraphPad Software,
San Diego, CA). All comparisons were conducted by student
t-tests, and ANOVA with Tukey multiple comparisons test where
indicated, and a value of p < 0.05 was considered statistically
significant. Values are expressed as the mean ± SEM.
RESULTS
We examined whether the number of proliferating cells in the
SVZ and SGZ was altered in adult mice lacking the CCK1R.
Subsequently, stereological quantification was performed to esti￾mate: (1) the number of migrating neuroblasts in the SVZ and
RMS; (2) the number of mature interneurons present in the OB;
and (3) the survival of adult-born cells in the OB. Also, we exam￾ined whether the number of proliferating cells, neuroblasts and
mature neurons was altered in the DG of CCK1R−/− mice.

with Tukey multiple comparisons test indicated a statistical dif￾ference between WT and female CCK1R−/− mice and female and
male CCK1R−/− mice, and a statistical similarity between WT
mice and male CCK1R−/− mice, and male and female WT mice
(Figure 2A).
The rate of cell proliferation in the SVZ was further exam￾ined by injecting BrdU (150 mg/kg i.p.) into mice 2 h prior to
their death, to label cells in S-phase of the cell cycle (Figure 1A).
The number of BrdU-positive (BrdU+) cell bodies in the SVZ
of female CCK1R−/− mice was 37% lower than the number in
female WT mice (Figures 2D,E).
LOWER NUMBERS OF DCX-IR NEUROBLASTS IN THE SVZ AND RMS OF
FEMALE CCK1R−/− MICE
Because cell proliferation in the SVZ and RMS of female
CCK1R−/− mice was reduced, we next examined whether the
number of neuroblasts in the SVZ and RMS were altered.
Neuroblasts in these regions were identified by immunoreactiv￾ity against DCX (Francis et al., 1999; Gleeson et al., 1999; Brown
et al., 2003). The number of DCX-ir neuroblasts in the SVZ and
RMS decreased by 29% in CCK1R−/− mice (Figures 2G–I).
NO CHANGE IN THE NUMBER OF GFAP-IR ASTROCYTES IN THE SVZ OF
FEMALE CCK1R−/− MICE
Immunohistochemistry for GFAP was performed to determine
whether reduced cell proliferation in the SVZ had an effect on the
number of astrocytes (Merkle et al., 2004). The number of GFAP￾ir cell bodies found in the SVZ of CCK1R−/− and WT mice was
similar (Figures 2C,F), suggesting that reduced proliferation in
the SVZ leads principally to the generation of fewer cells of neural
lineage.
FEWER PROLIFERATING PRECURSOR CELLS IN THE SVZ AND RMS OF
CCK1R−/− FEMALE MICE LEAD TO A REDUCED NUMBER OF MATURE
NEURONS IN THE GL OF THE OB
As cells born in the SVZ migrate along the RMS toward the OB,
where they differentiate into local interneurons (Luskin, 1993;
Lois and Alvarez-Buylla, 1994), the effect of reduced prolifera￾tion in the SVZ on the number of mature interneurons in the OB
was examined. Mature OB interneurons were identified using an
antibody against NeuN. Despite the reduction in the number of
proliferating precursors in the SVZ of CCK1R−/− mice, the num￾ber of NeuN-ir cell bodies in the GCL was similar to the number
found in WT mice (Figures 3A,B). In the GL, however, the mod￾est 11% decrease in NeuN-ir cell bodies in female CCK1R−/−
mice differed statistically from WT controls (Figures 3C,D).
SUBTYPES OF INTERNEURONS IN THE OB OF FEMALE CCK1R−/− MICE
REMAIN UNAFFECTED, EXCEPT FOR PERIGLOMERULAR TH-IR
INTERNEURONS
Subclasses of granular and periglomerular cells in the OB can be
identified by expression of GABA, TH (Betarbet et al., 1996), cal￾bindin, and calretinin (Rogers, 1992; Rogers and Resibois, 1992;
De Marchis et al., 2007). We examined whether the reduction
of cell proliferation in the SVZ of CCK1R−/− mice affected the
number of interneurons in each of these subclasses.
In the GCL of female CCK1R−/− and WT mice, the num￾ber of calretinin-ir cell bodies was similar (Figures 3E,F). In
the GL of female CCK1R−/− mice, the number of calretinin￾ir (Figures 3G,H), calbindin-ir (Figures 3I,J) and GABA-ir
(Figures 3K,L) cell bodies was also similar to the number esti￾mated in WT mice. However, the 23% reduction in the number
of TH-ir cell bodies in the GL of CCK1R−/− mice was statisti￾cally different from WT mice (Figures 3M,N). Double-labeling
experiments revealed that the number of cells in the GL that co￾expressed GABA- and TH-LI was similar in CCK 1R−/− and WT
mice (Figures 3O,P), as was the proportion of GABA-ir cells that
co-expressed TH-LI (Figure 3Q). This suggests that the decreased
number of TH-ir cell bodies in the GL of female CCK1R−/− mice
is not due to a reduced number of GABA/TH co-expressing cells,
nor a decrease of TH expression in GABA-ir cells.
NO CHANGE IN THE NUMBER OF NEWBORN CELLS IN THE OB OF
CCK1R−/− FEMALE MICE
We next examined the effect of reduced SVZ precursor prolifer￾ation on the number of newborn cells that migrate to, integrate
and survive in the GCL and GL of the OB. BrdU (50 mg/kg
i.p.) was administered twice daily for 5 consecutive days. The
mice were killed 42 days after the last BrdU administration, a

that co-expressed GABA-LI was also similar in WT (68%) and
CCK1R−/− mice (68%) (Figure 4D).
Double-immunofluorescence for BrdU and NeuN was also
performed (Figure 4I). Forty-two days after the last BrdU
administration, the number of cells in the GCL that were
BrdU+ and contained NeuN-LI was statistically similar in
CCK1R−/− and WT mice (Figure 4G), as was the propor￾tion of BrdU+ cell bodies in the GCL that co-expressed
NeuN-LI (Figure 4H). Likewise, the number of cells in the GCL
that were BrdU+ and contained calretinin-LI was similar in
CCK1R−/− and WT mice (Figures 4F,J,L), as was the proportion
of BrdU+ cell bodies in the GCL that co-expressed calretinin-LI
(Figure 4K).
In the GL, the number of BrdU+ cell bodies observed in
female CCK1R−/− mice was 15% lower, but not statistically
different to the number observed in WT mice (Figures 5A,B).
Because interneurons in the GL express TH, GABA and cal￾bindin, double-immunofluorescence histochemistry for BrdU
and these interneuronal subtypes was performed. Forty-two
days after the last BrdU administration, the number of BrdU+
cells in the GL that co-labeled TH-LI in CCK1R−/− mice was
38% lower than in WT mice (Figures 5C,E,F), and the propor￾tion of BrdU+ cells co-expressing TH-LI reduced from 11% in
WT mice, to 9% in CCK1R−/− mice (Figure 5D). There were
29% fewer BrdU+ cells in the GL of CCK1R−/− mice that
co-labeled GABA-LI (Figures 5G,I), although the proportion of
BrdU+ cell bodies that co-expressed GABA-LI remained sim￾ilar to levels observed in WT mice (Figure 5H). No statistical
change in the number BrdU+ cells in the GL that co-labeled
calbindin-LI (Figures 5J,L), nor the proportion of BrdU+ cells
that co-expressed calbindin-LI (Figure 5K) was observed when
comparing WT and CCK1R−/− mice. Finally, no BrdU+ cell
bodies in GCL or GL of CCK1R−/− or WT mice were found to
co-express DCX-LI 42 days after the last BrdU administration
(data not shown).
ADULT FEMALE CCK1R−/− MICE HAVE A LOWER NUMBER OF
PROLIFERATING CELLS IN THE SGZ
To examine whether CCK1R deletion leads to a change in the
number of proliferating cells in the DG, immunoreactivity against
Ki67 was performed to identify proliferating cells in the SGZ
(i.e., cells bordering the polymorph and granule layers of the
DG), who subsequently differentiate into granule cells in the DG
(Eriksson et al., 1998; Cameron and McKay, 2001; Kee et al.,
2002; Ming and Song, 2011; von Bohlen Und Halbach, 2011).
Ki67-ir cell bodies in the SGZ of female CCK1R−/− mice were
down 56% in comparison to female WT controls (Figures 6A–C).
A statistical difference in the number of Ki67 cells in the SGZ
was observed when comparing WT and female CCK1R−/− mice
and female CCK1R−/− vs. male CCK1R−/− mice, while WT and
male CCK1R−/− mice were statistically similar, as were male
and female WT mice (Figure 6A, ANOVA with Tukey multiple
comparisons test).
BrdU (150 mg/kg i.p.) was also injected into mice 2 h prior
to their death (Figure 1A). BrdU+ cell bodies were found in the
SGZ, where their number in female CCK1R−/− mice was 38%
lower than in female WT mice (Figures 6D–F).
LOWER NUMBERS OF DCX-IR NEUROBLASTS IN THE DENTATE GYRUS
OF FEMALE CCK1R−/− MICE
Because neural progenitors in the SGZ give rise to immature
neurons (Van Praag et al., 2002; Ming and Song, 2005), we
examined whether the number of DCX-ir neuroblasts in the
DG were altered in female CCK1R−/− mice. DCX-ir cell bod￾ies were observed within the SGZ and GrDG, with dendritic
processes extending through the GrDG, and into the molecu￾lar layer (Figure 6H). There were 80% fewer DCX-ir neuroblasts
in the SGZ and GrDG of CCK1R−/− mice than in WT mice
(Figures 6G–I).
SIMILAR NUMBERS OF GFAP-IR ASTROCYTES IN THE DENTATE GYRUS
OF FEMALE CCK1R−/− MICE
Immunohistochemistry for GFAP was performed to determine
whether reduced proliferation in the SGZ also influenced the
number of astrocytes in the DG. Strong GFAP-LI was observed
in the DG of CCK1R−/− and WT mice (Figures 6K,L), and the
number of GFAP-ir astrocytes in the SGZ and GrDG was quan￾tified. We found 12% fewer GFAP-ir astrocytes in CCK1R−/−
mice which was not statistically different from WT controls
(Figure 6J), suggesting that reduced proliferation in the SGZ of
CCK1R−/− female mice leads principally to the generation of
fewer cells of neural lineage, without affecting the generation of
astrocytes.
SIMILAR NUMBERS OF CALBINDIN-IR CELL BODIES IN THE DENTATE
GYRUS OF FEMALE CCK1R−/− MICE
Newly generated neurons in the SGZ migrate a short distance
to the GrDG (Ming and Song, 2005), where they mature into
neurons that express calbindin (Sloviter, 1989; Markakis and
Gage, 1999; Van Praag et al., 2002). Immunohistochemistry
for calbindin was performed to determine whether reduced
proliferation in the SGZ also led to fewer calbindin-ir neu￾rons in the GrDG. Although the number of calbindin-ir cell
bodies in CCK1R−/− mice was 10% fewer than in WT mice
(Figures 6M–O), this change was not statistically different.
NO CHANGE IN THE NUMBER OF MATURE NEWBORN CELLS IN THE
DENTATE GYRUS OF CCK1R−/− FEMALE MICE
We next examined the effect of reduced SGZ precursor prolifera￾tion on the number of newborn cells that integrate and survive in
the GrDG. BrdU (50 mg/kg i.p.) was administered twice daily for
5 consecutive days, and the mice were killed 42 days after the last
BrdU administration (Figure 1B), a suitable period for assessing
the number of newly born cells that have survived and matured
in the GrDG (Ming and Song, 2005).
In the GrDG, the number of BrdU+ cell bodies observed
in CCK1R−/− female mice was similar to the number
observed in WT mice (Figures 6P–R). Because the majority
of mature neurons in the GrDG express calbindin-LI, double￾immunofluorescence histochemistry for calbindin and BrdU was
performed to examine whether reduced SGZ proliferation in
CCK1R−/− mice led to a change in the number of BrdU+ new￾born cells that had differentiated into calbindin-ir interneurons.
Forty-two days after the last BrdU administration, the number of
cells in the GrDG that were BrdU+ and contained calbindin-LI

was 18% fewer in CCK1R−/− mice, but not statistically different
to WT mice (Figures 6S–V). A 12% decrease in the proportion
of BrdU+ cell bodies in the GCL that co-expressed calbindin-LI
was found in CCK1R−/− mice (Figure 6W), which also was
not statistically different to the proportion found in WT mice.
Finally, 42 days after the last BrdU administration, no BrdU+ cell
bodies in the GrDG of CCK1R−/− or WT mice were found to
co-express DCX-LI (data not shown).
DISCUSSION
Using genetically modified mice, we provide evidence that CCK,
by actions mediated through the CCK1R, can regulate cell pro￾liferation in the adult mouse SVZ and SGZ. Female mice lacking
these receptors were found to have fewer proliferating cells and
less migratory neuroblasts in the SVZ, RMS and SGZ. Our data
indicate that the reduced number of proliferating precursors in
the SVZ and SGZ of CCK1R−/− female mice had a discrete effect
on the number of mature neurons in the OB: the number NeuN-ir
cell bodies and TH-ir interneurons in the GL of the OB was
reduced, as was the number of BrdU+ cell bodies in the GL that
co-expressed TH-LI or GABA-LI.
In general, our results point to a regulation of neurogene￾sis in the adult brain, so that a steady neuronal population is
maintained in the OB and GrDG, irrespective of the number of
proliferating cells in the SVZ or SGZ, or their rate of prolifera￾tion. Despite the reduction in proliferating cells and neuroblasts
in the SVZ, RMS and SGZ of female CCK1R−/− mice, the num￾ber of adult-born BrdU+ cell bodies in the GL, GCL and GrDG
was similar to WT mice 42 days after the last BrdU pulse. This
coincided with a similar number of adult-born BrdU+ neurons
in CCK1R−/− and WT mice that expressed: NeuN-, GABA or
calretinin-LI in the GCL; calbindin-LI in the GCL; and calbindin￾LI in the GrDG. The capacity for maintaining the number of
adult-born cells that survived and integrated into the circuitry
of the OB and GrDG, despite the lower availability of adult￾born cells, led to the number of mature NeuN-ir and calretinin-ir
cell bodies in the GCL, calbindin-ir, calretinin-ir and GABA-ir
cell bodies in the GL, and calbindin-ir cell bodies in the GrDG
remaining the same in CCK1R−/− and WT mice.
Our findings are in contrast with previous reports that used
agents that cause permanent and often complete suppression of
proliferation in the SVZ or SGZ, and that examined the effects
of reduced SVZ/SGZ proliferation over a longer period. In previ￾ous work, genetic ablation of newly formed neurons in adult mice
led to a progressive reduction in the number of DCX-ir neurob￾lasts in the SVZ and a gradual decrease in OB granule cells 3–12
weeks after ablation (Imayoshi et al., 2008). Similarly, x-ray irra￾diation that reduced adult-born cells in the SVZ by 96% led to a
20% decrease in OB granule cells 8 weeks after irradiation (Valley
et al., 2009). Here, we report a ∼40% reduction in the number
of proliferating cells and 29% fewer DCX-ir neuroblasts in the
SVZ/RMS of female CCK1R−/− mice, but no consequent change
in the number of OB granule cells.
A key difference in models used previously is the almost com￾plete suppression of proliferating cells and neuroblasts in the
SVZ/RMS that was induced in adult animals (Imayoshi et al.,
2008; Valley et al., 2009). This compares to the permanent,
but less vigorous, reduction of proliferating cells and neurob￾lasts that arises from the developmental deletion of the CCK1R,
which allows for the generation of a lower than normal num￾ber of adult-born cells that still have the capacity to migrate to
and integrate into OB circuitry. Thus, an explanation for our
observation of no change in OB granule cells when SVZ pro￾liferation is reduced, is a greater rate of survival of adult-born
cells generated in the SVZ and RMS of CCK1R−/− mice. In sup￾port of this notion, the number of mature BrdU+ interneurons
in the GCL that expressed GABA-LI, calretinin-LI or NeuN-LI
was similar in CCK1R−/− and WT mice 42 days after the last
BrdU pulse.
Under normal conditions, adult-born cells generated in the
SGZ add to the number of neurons in the GrDG over time (Bayer
et al., 1982; Dayer et al., 2003; Imayoshi et al., 2008), whereas abla￾tion of neurogenesis prevents such an increase so that the number
and density of neurons in the GrDG remain constant (Imayoshi
et al., 2008). If the same principles were to apply here, we would
expect the number of neurons in the GrDG of CCK1R−/− mice
to be lower than the numbers in WT mice. However, we found
a similar number of calbindin-ir cell bodies in the GrDG of
CCK1R−/− and WT mice, despite the reduction in proliferating
cells (38 and 56% fewer BrdU+ and Ki67-ir cell bodies, respec￾tively) and DCX-ir neuroblasts (80%) in the SGZ. Again, this
may be attributable to the increased rate of survival of adult-born

cells generated in the SGZ, where 42 days after the last injection
of BrdU, a similar number of BrdU+ cell bodies and BrdU cell
bodies that expressed calbindin-ir was observed in the GrDG of
CCK1R−/− and WT mice.
The situation was different in the GL of the OB, where fewer
TH-ir interneurons and BrdU+ cell bodies that expressed either
TH-LI or GABA-LI were found in CCK1R−/− mice. No change
in the number of calbindin-ir cell bodies, or BrdU+/calbindin￾ir interneurons was observed in the GL however, suggesting that
CCK1R deletion and/or reduced SVZ proliferation has a limited
influence on calbindin-expressing interneurons, most of which
are generated early in life (De Marchis et al., 2007). In contrast,
TH-ir and calretinin-ir cell bodies in the GL are predominantly
generated in the adult (McLean and Shipley, 1988; Winner et al.,
2002; De Marchis et al., 2007) and the number of TH-ir cell bodies
was affected in adult female CCK1R−/− mice. [N.B. the non￾statistical trend for a reduction in calretinin-ir cell bodies in the
GL of CCK1R−/− mice, and previous qualitative results showing
reduced numbers of calretinin-ir cell bodies in CCK1R−/− mice
(Stanic et al., 2008 ´ ).] Recently, we also found changes to the num￾bers of calretinin-ir and TH-ir, but not calbindin-ir, cell bodies in
the GL of adult mice following an induced reduction of prolifer￾ation in the SVZ (Sui et al., 2012), and odor deprivation reduces
TH expression in the GL, without affecting the GABA, calbindin
and calretinin phenotypes (Stone et al., 1991; Baker et al., 1993;
Bastien-Dionne et al., 2010). Our results therefore suggest that
the CCK1 receptor may play an important role in modulating the
generation and/or survival of TH (and calretinin) interneurons in
the GL of the OB.
While plasticity in the population of TH-ir interneurons may
reflect their ability to adapt to continuously changing odor envi￾ronments (Doetsch and Hen, 2005), changes in subtypes of
interneurons present in the OB may alter the complex circuitry
that exists within the OB. This includes the intricate arrangement
of dendrites in the external plexiform layer that are derived from
mitral, granule and tufted cells that engage in dendro-dendritic
reciprocal synaptic interactions with each other (Rall et al., 1966;
Shepherd, 1972; Jackowski et al., 1978; Shipley et al., 1996; Stanic´
et al., 2010), and the interactions of periglomerular cells in the
glomerular layer (Shipley and Ennis, 1996; Kosaka and Kosaka,
2005). Because less TH-ir interneurons were integrated into OB
circuitry, functional properties of mitral and tufted cells [e.g.,
their odorant-evoked firing properties (Nagayama et al., 2004)]
and the timing of the transmission of olfactory information
and bulbar output may be altered. Thus, it would be interest￾ing to determine whether deficits in olfactory functioning, e.g.,
short- and long-term odor memory, odor discrimination and fear
conditioning (Gheusi et al., 2000; Rochefort et al., 2002; Lazarini
et al., 2009; Valley et al., 2009), exist in adult CCK1R−/− female
mice.
Proliferating cells and neuroblasts were reduced only in female
CCK1R−/− mice. It is possible that this sex difference is related
to estrous cycle influences (Ormerod and Galea, 2001) because,
for example, estrus induction is associated with increased num￾bers of dividing cells in the SVZ/RMS of prairie voles (Smith
et al., 2001), and adult female rats produce more cells during
proestrus, compared with estrus and diestrus (Tanapat et al.,
1999). Furthermore, levels of CCK fluctuate in the brain during
a normal estrous cycle (Hilke et al., 2007). Thus, lower levels of
CCK during pro-estrus, combined with absence of the CCK1R,
may reduce the rate of cell division in neurogenic regions of the
female mouse brain. However, we do not favor this explanation
because, in C57BL6 mice, proliferation or neurogenesis in the
SGZ is not influenced by the estrous cycle or after ovariectomy
(Lagace et al., 2007), and no gender differences in hippocampal
proliferation or neurogenesis was observed here, or previously
in mice (Lagace et al., 2007; Manning et al., 2012). Thus, it is
unlikely that the estrous cycle and fluctuating estradiol levels
contributed to the lower numbers of proliferating cells and neu￾roblasts observed in female CCK1R−/− mice. The neurochemical
mechanisms underlying reduced proliferating cells and neurob￾lasts in female CCK1R−/− mice remains unclear and awaits future
investigations.
In conclusion, we show a reduction of proliferation in the SVZ
and SGZ of adult female CCK1R−/− mice that does not alter the
number of mature neurons in the OB and GrDG, except for TH-ir
interneurons in the GL of the OB. Despite these mice having fewer
proliferating cells and neuroblasts, we proposed that the numbers
of mature neurons are maintained in the OB and GrDG due to the
enhanced survival of neuroblasts and mature neurons that inte￾grate into the circuitry of the OB and DG. Further investigations
are needed to understand the role of these “longer-surviving”
adult-born cells on the circuitry and function of the OB and DG.
