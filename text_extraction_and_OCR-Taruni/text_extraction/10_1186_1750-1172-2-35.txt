Abstract
Acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) occurs after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant
and is a reaction of donor immune cells against host tissues. Activated donor T cells damage host
epithelial cells after an inflammatory cascade that begins with the preparative regimen. About 35%–
50% of hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients will develop acute GVHD. The exact
risk is dependent on the stem cell source, age of the patient, conditioning, and GVHD prophylaxis
used. Given the number of transplants performed, we can expect about 5500 patients/year to
develop acute GVHD. Patients can have involvement of three organs: skin (rash/dermatitis), liver
(hepatitis/jaundice), and gastrointestinal tract (abdominal pain/diarrhea). One or more organs may
be involved. GVHD is a clinical diagnosis that may be supported with appropriate biopsies. The
reason to pursue a tissue biopsy is to help differentiate from other diagnoses which may mimic
GVHD, such as viral infection (hepatitis, colitis) or drug reaction (causing skin rash). Acute GVHD
is staged and graded (grade 0-IV) by the number and extent of organ involvement. Patients with
grade III/IV acute GVHD tend to have a poor outcome. Generally the patient is treated by
optimizing their immunosuppression and adding methylprednisolone. About 50% of patients will
have a solid response to methylprednisolone. If patients progress after 3 days or are not improved
after 7 days, they will get salvage (second-line) immunosuppressive therapy for which there is
currently no standard-of-care. Well-organized clinical trials are imperative to better define second￾line therapies for this disease. Additional management issues are attention to wound infections in
skin GVHD and fluid/nutrition management in gastrointestinal GVHD. About 50% of patients with
acute GVHD will eventually have manifestations of chronic GVHD.
Disease name and synonyms
Acute graft-versus-host disease or acute GVHD.
Definition and diagnostic criteria
Acute graft versus host disease generally occurs after allo￾geneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). It is a
reaction of donor immune cells against host tissues. The
three main tissues that acute GVHD affects are the skin,
liver, and gastrointestinal tract.
Clinically, the diagnosis is suspected when a recipient of
HSCT develops any or all of the following signs or symp￾toms: dermatitis (skin rash), cutaneous blisters, crampy
abdominal pain with or without diarrhea, persistent nau￾sea and vomiting, hepatitis (with elevation of bilirubin
and/or liver enzymes). Typically, these symptoms occur
before day 100 after the HSCT, but may occur later. Symp￾toms most frequently start with donor engraftment, but
may happen later. Acute GVHD is a clinical diagnosis but,

as many the symptoms of acute GVHD are non-specific,
histologic confirmation, especially if the symptoms are
atypical or involve just the liver or gut, may be extremely
useful.
Acute GVHD is staged by the number and extent of organ
involvement. The current staging system was devised in
1994 (table 1) [1]. Recent data support the use of the grad￾ing system since it is able to subdivide patients into risk
categories for complications and mortality. In this system,
patients are divided into one of four grades (I-IV) depend￾ing on the degree, or stage, of involvement in three
organs. The skin is staged with percent body surface
involved, the liver is staged with degree of bilirubin eleva￾tion, and the gastrointestinal tract is staged with amount
of diarrhea. Using the criteria (table 1), a single grade is
assigned to each patient.
There is a similar grading system devised by the Interna￾tional Bone Marrow Transplant Registry (IBMTR). This
sytem tries to diminish interobserver variability in GVHD
grading. The system assigns one of four risk categories (A￾D) to each patient with acute GVHD. It is still unknown
whether one system is better at predicting outcome of
patients with acute GVHD.
Epidemiology
In 2003, 13,700 allogeneic HSCTs were reported to the
Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant
Research (CIBMTR). The incidence of grade II-IV acute
GVHD is roughly 35%–50%. The risk of GVHD increases
with the use of unrelated donors, mismatched donor,
older age of the donor, mutliparous female donor, older
age of the recipient, graft type (cord blood has a lower rate
than marrow or peripheral blood stem cells), and certain
conditoning regimens. Given the current ratio of related
versus unrelated donor transplants performed yearly
(almost 2:1), we can expect about 5500 patients to
develop grade II-IV acute GVHD per year.
Clinical description
The clinical manifestations of acute GVHD represent the
organs involved. The earliest and most common manifes￾tation is skin GVHD. This is essentially a maculopapular
rash that can begin anywhere in the body but often starts
with palm and sole involvement. The patient may com￾plain of pruritus or tenderness in affected areas. The onset
of the rash normally correlates with engraftment of donor
cells. The timing of engraftment depends on stem cell
source (faster with peripheral blood stem cells) and inten￾sity of preparative regimen. Patients receiving reduced
intensity regimens, which do not result in marrow abla￾tion, often have a later onset of GVHD. This is due both to
the later engraftment and the damage from the prepara￾tive regimen producing cytokines that drive the immune
responses resulting in clinical GVHD. As the rash
progresses, it may become confluent. In severe cases, blis￾ters may occur. The gastrointestinal manifestations
include diarrhea which may become bloody, cramping,
nausea, vomiting and failure to thrive [2]. Furthermore,
jaundice from hyperbilirubinemia is the hallmark of liver
GVHD [3], although a hepatitic variant of GVHD with a
rise in liver enzymes like an acute viral hepatitis, has been
recognized [4,5]. While acute GVHD is a clinical diagno￾sis, there are other conditions that can mimic or coexist
with GVHD, such as drug toxicity (especially common in
patients post transplant on multiple antimicrobial agents,
immunosuppressive drugs, hyperalimentation, receiving
methotrexate, etc.) and infection. For example, the symp￾toms of cytomegalovirus (CMV) colitis (diarrhea, abdom￾inal pain) may be very similar to those of acute GVHD.
Therefore, it is recommended to obtain a biopsy to con￾firm clinical suspicion whenever possible. Finally, while
the definition of acute GVHD is well-accepted as involv￾ing three organs, certain post-transplant complications
may be related to or actually represent GVHD. For exam￾ple, a few patients develop non-infectious pulmonary
infiltrates upon engraftment and the outcome is generally
poor. Animal models suggest that the immunologic

mechanisms contributing to lung inflammation after
HSCT may be similar to those responsible for GVHD [6].
Etiology
The pathophysiology of acute GVHD has been described
by Ferrara and colleagues as a three-phase phenomenon
[7,8]. Please refer to figure 1. The first involves damage to
host tissues by inflammation from the preparative chemo￾and/or radio-therapy regimen. In the second phase, both
recipient and donor antigen-presenting cells (APCs) as
well as inflammatory cytokines triggering the activation of
donor-derived T cells, which expand and differentiate into
effector cells [9]. In this activation phase, minor histo￾compatibility antigens play a central role, particularly in
the setting of matched sibling transplantations.
T-cell activation pathways result in the transcription of
genes for cytokines, such as IL-2 and interferon. T cells
that produce IL-2 and interferon are considered to be of
the Th1 phenotype, compared to T cells that produce pre￾dominantly IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, and IL-13, which define the
Th2 phenotype, that are felt to modulate GVHD [10].
In the third phase, the effector phase, activated donor T
cells mediate cytotoxicity against target host cells through
Fas-Fas ligand interactions, perforin-granzyme B, and the
additional production of cytokines, such as TNF-α TNF-α
is produced mainly by monocytes and macrophages, and
secondarily by T lymphocytes and natural killer cells.
TNF-α has been implicated in the pathophysiology of
GVHD at several steps in the process, including induction

of apoptosis in target tissues through the TNF-α receptor;
activation of macrophages, neutrophils, eosinophils, B
cells, and T cells; stimulating production of additional
inflammatory cytokines (IL-1, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, and TNF￾α itself); increased expression of HLA; and the facilitation
of T-lymphocyte lysis. High levels of TNF-α also have
been associated with an increased incidence of GVHD in
bone marrow transplantation (BMT) recipients. This allo￾geneic interaction in the setting of cytokine dysregulation
leads to the tissue damage characteristic of acute GVHD
[9,11-15].
Risk factors
Genetic basis of acute GVHD
Major histocompatibility antigens (or Human leukocyte
antigens – HLA) are located on the short arm of chromo￾some 6 at the p21 position in humans [16,17]. The major
histocompatibility complex (MHC) is a closely linked,
highly polymorphic multi-gene and multi-allelic complex
playing the critical role in both cell-mediated and
humoral immune responses. HLA class I antigens (HLA-A,
HLA-B, and HLA-C) have a wide distribution and are
found on all nucleated cells. HLA class II antigens (DR,
DQ, and DP) are generally found on the cells involved in
the immune response. CD4 T cells recognize foreign anti￾gens by the presentation of class II HLA molecules. Inter￾estingly, class II HLA products are particularly induced on
the skin and intestinal tract epithelial tissues, they may
promote specific targeting during acute GVHD. Matching
BMT recipients with sibling donors sharing identical HLA
antigens improves engraftment and decreased GVHD
compared to mismatched siblings. However, acute GVHD
is seen in matched sibling pairs-demonstrating factors
contribute to the immune reaction. Minor histocompati￾bility antigens (miH) are peptides derived from intracellu￾lar proteins presented by MHC molecules to donor T cells.
Perhaps the best known of these are the minor antigens
from products from the Y chromosome. Alloreactivity in
the setting of matched siblings then involves the recogni￾tion of different nonself peptides bound in the T cell
receptor and carried by the recipient MHC. Following the
presentation of miH (foreign peptide) by MHC to donor
T cell, i.e., CD4 in the context of MHC class II and CD8 in
class I, the presence of nonself peptide bound to the MHC
molecules trigger the T cell and induction of GVHD
occurs. Current research is focused on identification of
additional non-MHC antigens that trigger alloreactivity.
With the ability to molecularly type the extensive HLA
region, it became evident that much more of the HLA
region had to be considered for optimal unrelated donor
selection. This is an area of explosive development, with
almost 200 new alleles identified each year. A detailed
review of the intricacies of the HLA system and selection
of donors is beyond the scope of this paper. There are sev￾eral recent excellent reviews [16,17]. However, a few guid￾ing principles can be stated. The most important is that it
is critical to have an experienced transplant immunoge￾neticist review all genetic data. Second, regions that were
not appreciated to have a role in GVHD (plus engraftment
and graft-versus-leukemia, GVL) in the matched sibling
transplants are clearly important in the unrelated/mis￾matched family donor. For example, the HLA-C and HLA￾DQ regions are routinely typed when looking for an alter￾native donor (the so called 10 antigen match). More
recently, HLA-DP and HLA linked NK cell typing has been
shown to play a role in the GVHD/GVL equations. Inter￾estingly, data collected on unrelated donor transplants
indicates, there is evidence that certain allelic mismatches
are „permissible“-that is, although the alleles are molecu￾larly different, the actual immune consequences are mod￾est to undetectable. It is also increasingly apparent that the
balance of GVH/GVL is shifted by the intensity of the pre￾parative regimen-so that the best match for an unrelated
donor transplant receiving a full preparative regimen may
be different from that in a non-myeloablative setting. The
complexities of the HLA system demonstrate why it is crit￾ical to have the input of an experienced transplant immu￾nogeneticist.
Other risk factors
The risk factors for acute GVHD are well defined. As dis￾cussed above, the most important factor is HLA disparity.
Among siblings, patients receiving matched grafts have
lower rates of GVHD than those receiving one, two or
three antigen mismatch grafts. For unrelated donor trans￾plants, the greater the degree of HLA-mismatch, the higher
the likelihood is of developing acute GVHD and the worse
the overall outcome [18-20]. Recent data from the
National Marrow Donor Program suggests that matching
at the allele level (high-resolution) as opposed to only at
the antigen (low-resolution) level provides advantage in
reducing the likelihood of GVHD. The incidence of seri￾ous (grade III/IV) acute GVHD is about 30% with a fully
matched (8/8) unrelated donor but is 40% with 1 or 2
allelic mismatches at class I [21,22]. This compares to
about a 20% incidence of serious acute GVHD for recipi￾ents of HLA-identical sibling transplants [23].
As for the source of the graft, unrelated cord blood has
become an important alternative stem cell source and has
some unique properties. The immunologic naiveté of
these stem cells allows for greater degrees of mismatch;
recipients of mismatched (4/6 or 5/6 HLA group match)
unrelated cord blood appear to have similar incidence of
acute GVHD and similar overall outcome as compared to
matched-sibling transplants [24]. There is increasing use
of peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) as a way of collecting
cells from related or unrelated donors. No randomized
study has been completed to determine if PBSC trans-

Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases 2007, 2:35 http://www.OJRD.com/content/2/1/35

plants change GVHD incidence or eventual outcome.
However, there is a suggestion from a meta-analysis that
acute GVHD is slightly increased (RR 1.16) and chronic
GVHD is increased (RR 1.53) when comparing PBSC to
bone marrow transplants [25]. Higher doses of CD34+
cells in the PBSC product correlate with more GVHD [26].
It is still debated whether the increase in GVHD will trans￾late to improved outcome due to higher graft-versus￾leukemia effect or worse outcome due to higher trans￾plant-related-mortality. Some groups have used T-cell
depletion which decreases the risk of acute GVHD [27-
29]. However, this approach has led to an increased inci￾dence of graft failure and slower immune reconstitution.
Clinically this has translated to more infection and
relapse.
Other factors can also increase the likelihood of acute
GVHD. Older age of both recipient and donor increase the
probability of GVHD [30]. Sex mismatch, specifically a
multiparous female donor into a male patient, increases
the likelihood of GVHD [31]. Furthermore, the intensity
of the preparative regimen does appear to correlate with
more acute GVHD. This effect may occur to more tissue
damage from the preparative regimen predisposing these
tissues to more inflammation from the alloreactive cells.
Higher doses of radiation do give rise to more GVHD [32],
and the more recent use of nonmyeloablative preparative
regimens has led to lower incidence of acute GVHD in
some studies [33-35].
Diagnostic methods
Acute GVHD is usually suspected based on the clinical
presentation. A biopsy can be used to confirm the diagno￾sis and should be used when there are competing diag￾noses, such as infection and drug reaction, in the
differential. Skin biopsies can show dyskeratotic keratino￾cytes, lymphocyte exocytosis, basal cell necrosis, deple￾tion of Langerhans cells, and satellite lymphocytes next to
the dyskeratotic keratinocytes. All findings are not neces￾sarily present in every skin biopsy and histology is not
always pathognomonic [36]. Typically, endoscopy of the
gastrointestinal tract reveals edema, mucosal sloughing
and possibly bleeding. Most typically these would be
found in the cecum, ileum and colon but also may involve
the upper intestinal tract. Histopathology shows crypt-cell
necrosis and dropout with crypt absecess [37]. Pathology
of liver GVHD can show early cytotoxic lymphocyte attack
on bile ducts to bizzare, irregular bile ducts, depending on
the timing of the biopsy vis a vis the duration of liver
GVHD prior to the biopsy. Epithelial cells can be flattened
with some missing nuclei. Other nuclei are often
enlarged, irregular, and hyperchromatic. Bile duct apopto￾sis and endothelialitis can also be seen [38].
Management
Currently, most centers use a combination of an immu￾nophilin (cyclosporine or tacrolimus) with short course
methotrexate. Although other regimens are being
explored, this particular regimen has been shown repeat￾edly to result in a reasonable balence of GVHD and graft
versus-tumor in matched sibling transplants after ablative
chemotherapy [39,40]. For higher risk groups or groups
receiving non-conventional grafts (such as mismatched
donors, older patients, reduced intensity regimens, etc.),
the best prophylaxis is less clearly established [41]. Myco￾phenolate mofetil (MMF) is often used in reduced inten￾sity transplantation for its effect in GVHD prophylaxis as
well as promoting engraftment [42]. For patients reciving
mismatched grafts, more intensive immunosuppression is
usually needed. Methods of ex-vivo T-cell depletion [43] as
well as pharmacologic in-vivo T cell depletion (antithymo￾cyte globulin, ATG [44], alemtuzumab [45]) have been
used to attempt to reduce the incidence of acute GVHD. In
general, these methods reduce acute GVHD but increase
the incidence of infection (due to delayed reconstitution
of the immune system) and the incidence of relapse (due
to a decreased graft-versus-leukemia effect).
Once GVHD occurs, all phases of GVHD induction are
active. Successful treatment will ultimately need to work
on all phases, if the process is to be stopped. Most centers
treat grade II-IV acute GVHD by continuing prophylactic
immunosuppression and adding methylprednisolone at 2
or 2.5 mg/kg/day. However, starting doses range from 1 to
>20 mg/kg/day [46]. Steroids are tapered after control of
GVHD. A rapid steroid taper (86 days) is just as effective
as a slow taper (147 days) in terms of preventing flares of
GVHD or chronic GVHD [47]. A few studies have reported
outcomes with high dose methylprednisolone (20 to 50
mg/kg/day). Patients that responded to these doses gener￾ally flared after dose reduction, and there were a number
of deaths secondary to opportunistic infections [48,49].
There is one randomized trial comparing high and low
dose methylprednisolone for the treatment of acute
GVHD [50]. Patients receiving 2 mg/kg/day and 10 mg/
kg/day had the same rate of response (70%) and the same
3-year actuarial survival (62%). Higher morbidity was
observed with the higher dose. Therefore, there is no com￾pelling argument to use the super high dose of steroids.
Initial response to steroids, either low-dose or high-dose,
is very predictive of future severity of GVHD and other
transplant complications. In general, about 40–50% of
patients have an overall response to corticosteroids [51].
Patients not responding to corticosteroids are treated with
salvage therapy. There is no specific approach that is con￾sidered standard of care. Anti-thymocyte globulin has
been used, and produces objective responses. However,

the long-term survival of patients treated with ATG is low
(median survival 4.1 months) given the severe immuno￾suppression and high incidence of infection [52]. There
are a number of other approaches under investigation.
Some of these include extracorporeal photopheresis [53],
pentostatin [54,55], sirolimus [56], infliximab[57], and
mesenchymal stem cells [58]. In general, a number of
these agents produce responses; however, infectious mor￾tality remains high. Systematic investigation of dosing
and timing of various salvage agents is clearly necessary in
well-designed, prospective clinical trials.
While the goal is not to review all potential salvage thera￾pies, a few types will be mentioned (Deeg recently pub￾lished an excellent review on therapies for steroid￾refractory GVHD [59]). For example, of twenty-two heav￾ily-treated patients with steroid-refractory acute GVHD
treated with pentostatin (an irreversible inhibitor of ade￾nosine-deaminase) on a phase I trial, seventeen had an
objective response. However, five patients that responded
died from late infections, either viral or fungal. The sur￾vival at one year was 25% [55]. Possibly, employing a sal￾vage approach such as this one earlier in the process of
acute GVHD may produce an improved outcome.
Monoclonal antibodies such as daclizumab and inflixi￾mab have been used to treat GVHD. MD Anderson Cancer
Center recently reviewed their experience using infliximab
(anti-TNF-α antibody) in 21 patients with steroid-refrac￾tory acute GVHD. This was the only drug added to these
patients. Sixty-seven percent responded, and there was sig￾nificant activity in gastrointestinal GVHD. There was a
high rate of infections, particularly fungal and viral. One￾year survival was 38% [60]. Another study compared
patients with steroid-refractory acute GVHD that received
infliximab versus those that did not, and found a higher
incidence of non-Candida invasive fungal infections in
those receiving infliximab [61]. Thus, while this and other
drugs may offer responses to patients with GVHD, it is
always important to remember that by far the greatest risk
will be increased infectious complications.
Additional issues for patients with GVHD are appropriate
management of symptoms. For example, patients with
severe gastrointestinal GVHD and diarrhea need careful
attention to fluid status, electrolyte management and pro￾tein-losing enteropathy. Patients with skin GVHD need to
be thoroughly examined for the presence of any open
sores or bullae, which may become infected. Since infec￾tious complications are so prevalent in these patients, fre￾quent monitoring of CMV PCR or antigenemia and
appropriate therapy is important [62]. Published CDC
(Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) guidelines
for prevention of infection (pneumcystis jirovecii pneu￾monia, bacterial, fungal, viral) should be closely followed
[63].
Prognosis
MacMillan et al. from the University of Minnesota recently
published the response of 443 patients with acute GVHD,
treated uniformly at their institution. Of the 443 patients
(all treated with prednisone), durable responses were
obtained in 245 (55%). There was a tendency to lower
response if patients begun with a higher grade. Recipients
of HLA-mismatched unrelated donor transplants were less
likely to respond. Fifty-three percent of patients were alive
at 1 year after initiation of steroid therapy, and 42% of
patients had developed chronic GVHD. Deaths were
mostly commonly attributed to ongoing GVHD and/or
infection [64]. Cahn and colleagues recently reported on
a multicenter study comparing the IBMTR and the Glucks￾berg scales. Both scales performed similarly. In general,
patients with grade C (IBMTR) or grade III (Glucksberg)
acute GVHD have about a 30% probability of long-term
survival. Those with grade D/grade IV acute GVHD, have
under 5% long-term survival. Patients without GVHD or
with grade A-B/grade I-II acute GVHD have above 80%
probability of long-term survival [65].
It is worth noting chronic GVHD as over half of the
patients with acute GVHD later develop chronic GVHD.
Chronic GVHD is a distinct clinical syndrome, although
there may be an overlap period, where the pateint has
symptoms of both acute and chornic GVHD. Chronic
GVHD resembles many spontaneously occuring autoim￾mune disorders, like scleroderma. Organs affected are
most typically skin (lichenoid and sclerotic rashes),
mouth, joints, liver, eyes, gastrointestinal tract, and occa￾sionally lungs [66]. While chronic GVHD can worsen sur￾vival due to more transplant-related mortality (infection
from immunosuppression), chronic GVHD can also have
a GVL effect. The basic pathophysiology of chronic GVHD
is at this point not well defined. Therapy relies on many
of the same medications used to treat acute GVHD, but
patients require prolonged treatment, extending over
months to years [67]. Despite the fascinating clinical man￾ifestations of chronic GVHD, the most important aspect
of chronic GVHD is the significant immune dysfunction
associated with the disease itself and its treatment. Infec￾tion accounts for the majority of deaths in chronic GVHD
patients.
Unresolved questions
Clearly, better immunosuppressive therapies are needed
for patients with severe GVHD. In addition, as immuno￾suppression is increased in these patients, the risk of infec￾tion needs to be carefully weighed. Agents for prevention
of acute GVHD and for treatment of steroid-refractory
acute GVHD need further investigation. To be able to truly

evaluate the potential clinical benefit of an agent, it needs
to be studied in prospective clinical trials. Furthermore, it
is imperative to continue investigations on methods of
cellular manipulation (selective T cell depletion, alloreac￾tive NK cell infusions) that may reduce GVHD while pre￾serving the graft-versus-leukemia effect. Since GVHD is
clearly the major barrier to successful HSCT, efforts are
needed in this specific area. If GVHD outcomes begin to
improve, we may see an increase in number of patients
being referred for HSCT.
