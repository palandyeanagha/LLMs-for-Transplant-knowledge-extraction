A B S T R A C T Tissue sensitivity to insulin was ex￾amined with the euglycemic insulin clamp technique
in 17 chronically uremic and 36 control subjects. The
plasma insulin concentration was raised by -100 ,uU/
ml and the plasma glucose concentration was main￾tained at the basal level with a variable glucose infu￾sion. Under these steady-state conditions of eugly￾cemia, the glucose infusion rate is a measure of the
amount of glucose taken up by the entire body. In
uremic subjects insulin-mediated glucose metabolism
was reduced by 47% compared with controls (3.71
+0.20 vs. 7.38+0.26 mg/kg-min; P < 0.001). Basal
hepatic glucose production (measured with [3H]-3-glu￾cose) was normal in uremic subjects (2.17+0.04
mg/kg-min) and suppressed normally by 94±+2% fol￾lowing insulin administration. In six uremic and
six control subjects, net splanchnic glucose balance
was also measured directly by the hepatic venous
catheterization technique. In the postabsorptive state
splanchnic glucose production was similar in uremics
(1.57+0.03 mg/kg.min) and controls (1.79+0.20 mg/
kg min). After 90 min of sustained hyperinsulinemia,
splanchnic glucose balance reverted to a net uptake
which was similar in uremics (0.42±0.11 mg/kg-min)
and controls (0.53+0.12 mg/kg.min). In contrast, glu￾cose uptake by the leg was reduced by 60% in the
uremic group (21+1 vs. 52+8 ,umol/min kg of leg
wt; P < 0.005) and this decrease closely paralleled the
decrease in total glucose metabolism by the entire
body. These results indicate that: (a) suppression of
hepatic glucose production by physiologic hyper￾insulinemia is not impaired by uremia, (b) insulin￾mediated glucose uptake by the liver is normal in
uremic subjects, and (c) tissue insensitivity to insulin
is the primary cause of insulin resistance in uremia.

the primary cause of glucose intolerance in patients
with chronic renal failure (1). This observation is con￾sistent with previous results documenting a delayed
and diminished glucose response after exogenous in￾sulin (2-9) and tolbutamide (3, 5, 8-11). However, in
none of these previous studies (1-11) was the site of
insulin resistance defined. Impaired insulin action
could result from one of three abnormalities: (a) im￾paired glucose uptake by peripheral tissues; (b) im￾paired glucose uptake by the liver; or (c) impaired
ability of insulin to inhibit hepatic glucose production.
In the present study we have used the euglycemic in￾sulin clamp technique in combination with tritiated
glucose and hepatic venous and femoral venous cathe￾terization to examine the contribution of the liver vs.
peripheral tissues to the impaired insulin action ob￾served in uremia.
METHODS
Subjects. 17 ambulatory volunteers with chronic (>3 yr)
renal disease of diverse etiology were studied. There
were 12 males and 5 females ranging in age from 23-57
yr (mean = 37+2). All uremic (mean = 106+2%) and con￾trol (mean = 105+2%) subjects were within 19% of ideal
body weight based on Metropolitan Life Insurance Tables
(1959), and were consuming a weight-maintaining diet con￾taining at least 200-300 g of carbohydrate/d for 3 d prior to
study. Although none of the subjects were instructed to
limit the amount of protein in their diet, a low serum urea
nitrogen to creatinine ratio was observed in four uremic
individuals, suggesting that they may have self imposed a
limitation on protein intake. Other than Amphogel and sodium
bicarbonate, subjects consumed no medications for at least 5
d prior to study. The mean serum urea nitrogen and serum
creatinine concentrations were 92+7 and 10.2+0.9 mg/dl,
respectively. Serum bicarbonate (23±+1), potassium (4.6+0.1),
calcium (9.1+0.2), and phosphate (4.2+0.3) concentrations,
and blood pH (7.40+0.01) were normal or only slightly re￾duced. Liver-function studies were within normal limits.
There was no family history of diabetes mellitus; clinical evi￾dence of diabetic retinopathy and neuropathy were absent;
renal histology, available for nine patients, revealed no
lesions suggestive of diabetic nephropathy.
The control population consisted of 36 healthy, ambulatory
volunteers, ranging in age from 21-59 yr (mean = 35+2) and
in percent ideal body weight from 96-113% (mean = 105
+2%). There were 24 males and 12 females. All tests were
performed in the postabsorptive state at 8 a.m. following a

12-h overnight fast. The purpose and potential risks of the
study were carefully explained to all subjects and their writ￾ten voluntary consent was obtained before their participation.
The study protocols were approved by the ethical com￾mittees ofthe Karolinska Institute and Huddinge Hospital and
the Yale University School of Medicine.
Euglycemic insulin clamp. Polyethylene catheters were
inserted into a forehand vein and an antecubital vein as de￾scribed (12). Following the collection of at least four base-line
samples, a prime-continuous (42.6 mU/m2-min) infusion of
crystalline porcine insulin (Eli Lilly and Co., Indianapolis,
Ind.) was administered to acutely raise and maintain the
plasma insulin concentration at -100 ,uU/ml above basal
levels (13). The plasma glucose concentration was maintained
at basal preinfusion levels by determination of the plasma glu￾cose concentration every 5 min and the periodic adjustment of
a variable 20% glucose solution as described (13). Under these
steady-state conditions of constant euglycemia, all of the in￾fused glucose is taken up by cells and, when added to the
rate of endogenous glucose production, serves as a measure of
the body's sensitivity to the infused insulin.
Endogenous glucose production. During all insulin
clamp studies the effect of hyperinsulinemia on hepatic glu￾cose production was quantitated by infusing [3H]-3-glucose as
previously described (14). For 180 min before initiating the in￾sulin infusion, each subject's glucose pool was labeled by a
primed-continuous infusion of tritiated glucose (New England
Nuclear, Boston, Mass.). The labeled glucose was adminis￾tered as a priming (25 ,Ci) plus continuous (0.25 ,uCi/min) in￾fusion of [3H]-3-glucose. Plasma samples for determination
of glucose specific activity were taken at 30-min intervals for
the first 2 h and at 10-15-min intervals for the subsequent
hour. A steady-state plateau of glucose specific activity was
achieved in all subjects during the third hour of [3H]-3-glu￾cose infusion and this plateau value was used to calculate basal
hepatic glucose production. After 3 h of continuous tritiated
glucose infusion, the insulin infusion was begun and the
tritiated glucose was continued at the same rate. During the
insulin infusion plasma samples for glucose specific ac￾tivity were drawn every 15 min for the first 90 min and every
5-10 min thereafter.
Hepatic venous catheterization. In six uremic subjects
(mean serum urea nitrogen and creatinine = 83+6 and
10.9±1.3 mg/dl, respectively) and in six controls, the insulin
clamp and tritiated glucose studies were performed in com￾bination with hepatic and femoral venous catheterization
to quantitate splanchnic and leg uptake of glucose after insu￾lin administration. In these studies a catheter was also in￾serted into the brachial artery to allow quantitation of arterio￾hepatic and arterio-femoral venous blood glucose concentra￾tion differences. The duration of the insulin clamp study
was 90 min. Hepatic blood flow was determined by the con￾tinuous infusion technique using indocyanine green dye as
previously described (15). Leg blood flow was measured using
the indicator-dilution procedure described by Jorfeldt and
Wahren (16).
Analytical procedures. Plasma and whole-blood glucose
concentrations were determined with the glucose oxidase
method (17). Methods for the determination of immunoreac￾tive insulin (18) and tritiated glucose specific activity (14)
have been described previously.
Calculations. During the insulin clamp studies the glu￾cose infusion rate was determined by calculating the
mean value observed from 20 to 120 min. The total amount
of glucose metabolized by the entire body was calculated by
adding the rate of endogenous glucose production (as de￾scribed below) to the exogenous glucose infusion rate re-
(quired to maintain euglycemia. Steady-state plasma glucose
and insulin levels were calculated from the mean values from
20 to 120 min. The metabolic clearance rate of insulin was cal￾culated by dividing the continuous insulin infusion rate by the
mean increment in plasma insulin concentration above base
line.
Glucose production in the basal state was determined by
dividing the tritiated glucose infusion rate (counts per
minute) by the steady-state plateau of tritiated glucose spe￾cific activity achieved during the last hour ofthe preinsulin in￾fusion control period. After the insulin-glucose administra￾tion (euglycemic insulin clamp), a nonsteady-state condition
in glucose specific activity exists and hepatic glucose pro￾duction was calculated by Steele's equations (19) in their
derivative form, using a value of 0.65 for the pool fraction
(20). The rate of endogenous glucose production was calcu￾lated by subtracting the glucose infusion rate from the rate of
glucose appearance as determined by the isotopic tracer
technique.
Net splanchnic glucose balance was calculated as the
product of the arteriohepatic venous difference for blood glu￾cose and the hepatic blood flow which was determined at
10-min intervals. Net splanchnic glucose balance (SGB) repre￾sents the result of two simultaneously occurring processes,
namely splanchnic glucose uptake (SGU) and hepatic glucose
production (HGP), and is given by the equation: net SGB
= SGU - HGP. From this equation splanchnic glucose up￾take can be quantitated from the sum of the net splanchnic
glucose balance (which is measured as the product of the
arterio-hepatic venous blood-glucose concentration dif￾ference x splanchnic blood flow) and endogenous hepatic
glucose production (which is measured with tritiated glucose).
Leg uptake of glucose was calculated as the product of the
arterio-femoral venous difference for blood glucose and the
leg blood flow which was determined at 30-min intervals.
All data are presented as the mean +-SEM. All statistical com￾parisons between uremic and control subjects were performed
by the unpaired t-test analysis (21). Statistical analyses within
groups were performed with the paired t-test analysis. Coeffi￾cients of correlation were determined by standard pro￾cedures (21).
RESULTS
The basal insulin concentration was higher in the
uremic subjects (18±1 ,U/ml) than in the control sub￾jects, (14±1 ,uU/ml, P < 0.01). Likewise, the steady￾state insulin concentration during insulin infusion was
slightly higher in the uremic subjects (137±6 ,gU/ml)
compared with controls (117±5 ,uU/ml, Table I). The
stability of plasma insulin concentration during the
plateau period is reflected by the coefficients of varia￾tion of 6±1% and 5.9±0.9% in the control and uremic
subjects, respectively. The metabolic clearance rate of
insulin in uremics (357±20 ml/m22 min) was signifi￾cantly reduced compared to the controls (414±25 ml/
m22 min, P < 0.002).
The basal glucose concentration was similar in the
uremic (90±2 mg/dl) and the control subjects (89±2 mg/
dl). The glucose concentration in the uremics was main￾tained at 89±2 mg/dl with a coefficient of variation of
3.5±0.2% during the insulin-infusion period. The cor￾responding values in the control subjects were 89+1
mg/dl and 4.4±0.2%.

Basal splanchnic glucose balance revealed a net output
of 1.57+0.03 mg/kg-min in the uremic subjects and net
output of 1.79+0.20 mg/kg -min in the controls (Fig. 1).
Consequently, there was a net glucose uptake by the
splanchnic area in the basal state which averaged 0.60
±0.04 mg/kg -min in the uremic subjects and 0.51+0.12
mg/kg -min in the controls (Fig. 1). Within 30 min after
starting the insulin infusion, net splanchnic glucose
balance in the uremic subjects became slightly positive
0.19±14 mg/kg-min, and subsequently increased to
0.42±0.11 mg/kg min by 90 min (Fig. 1). A similar in￾crease was observed in controls. Splanchnic glucose
uptake was not significantly changed from base line in
either the uremic (0.50+0.04 mg/kg-min) or control
(0.56±0.12) groups after the 90-min period of insulin
infusion (Fig. 1).
Basal leg uptake of glucose in the uremic subjects
(3.18±1.12 ,umol/kg*min) was slightly, although not
significantly, less than in the controls, 6.22±0.81 umol/
kg - min, Fig. 2). Following insulin infusion, leg glucose
uptake increased in both groups, reaching a plateau
value (60-90 min) in the uremics of2l 1 ,umol/kg min,
which was 60% lower than in the controls, 52±8 ,mol/
kg min (P < 0.005, Fig. 2). The total amount of glucose
metabolized by the six uremic and six control subjects
who were studied with combined hepatic and femoral
venous catheterization was 3.36±0.28 and 7.61±0.84
mg/kg min, respectively (P < 0.001). The 56% reduction
in total glucose metabolism in the uremic subjects is
similar to the 60% decrease in glucose uptake by the
leg. Leg blood flow in the basal state was similar in
controls (0.56±0.05 liter/min) and uremics (0.68±0.12
liter/min) and remained unchanged during insulin
administration.

ance have remained unclear. Previous studies employ￾ing both the oral and intravenous glucose tolerance
tests have documented that insulin secretion is not im￾paired in uremic subjects (1-3, 5, 6, 8-11). In a recent
study using the glucose clamp technique (1) we docu￾mented that insulin secretion was not impaired in most
patients with chronic renal failure. Instead, decreased
tissue sensitivity to insulin was responsible for the ab￾normal glucose metabolism. Tissue insensitivity to in￾sulin could result from any of the following three ab￾normalities: (a) augmented hepatic glucose production
which is not normally suppressed by insulin, (b) im￾paired hepatic uptake of glucose, or (c) impaired
peripheral (muscle and adipose) tissue uptake of
glucose.
The present results indicate that neither augmented
basal hepatic glucose production, nor incomplete sup￾pression of hepatic glucose production following insu￾lin can account for the marked insulin resistance ob￾served in uremic patients under the present experi￾mental conditions. Basal hepatic glucose production,
measured with [3H]-3-glucose, was 2.17±0.04 mg/kg.
min, a value that was nearly identical to controls, 2.18
±0.06 mg/kg min. More important, after insulin, he￾patic glucose production was suppressed by >90% in
both the uremic and control groups. To provide an inde￾pendent measure of hepatic glucose production, six
uremic and six control subjects were studied simultane￾ously with tritiated glucose and hepatic venous
catheterization. Again, in both uremic and control
groups, basal splanchnic glucose production (1.57
±0.03 vs. 1.79±0.20 mg/kg*min, respectively) was
similar. After 90 min of insulin administration, splanch￾nic glucose balance reverted to a net uptake that was
also similar in both uremics and controls (0.42±0.11 vs.
0.53±0.12 mg/kg *min). Because net splanchnic glucose
balance (hepatic venous catheter technique) (SGB),
and hepatic glucose production ([3H]-3-glucose) (HGP)
were measured simultaneously splanchnic glucose up￾take (SGU) could be calculated from the equation:
SGU = HGP + net SGB. As can be seen in Fig. 1,
splanchnic glucose uptake in the postabsorptive state
was similar in uremic and control subjects. After hyper￾insulinemia, no significant change in splanchnic glu￾cose uptake was observed in either group. These results
indicate that differences in glucose uptake by the
liver and extrahepatic splanchnic tissues can not ac￾count for the insulin resistance observed in uremic sub￾jects after intravenous insulin and glucose adminis￾tration. These results are in keeping with our previous
observations (22) and indicate that (a) the primary ef￾fect of insulin is to suppress hepatic glucose produc￾tion and (b) insulin has little effect on enhancing he￾patic glucose uptake. Thus, the results of both the iso￾topic dilution studies as well as direct splanchnic
arterio-venous glucose measurements are in close
agreement, and indicate that neither excessive hepatic
glucose production, nor impaired splanchnic glucose
uptake can account for the glucose intolerance of
uremia observed in the present study. It should be
noted, however, that splanchnic glucose uptake follow￾ing euglycemic hyperinsulinemia is quite small and
represents only 5-10% of the total amount of glucose
metabolized by the entire body. This is in keeping with
our previous observations that splanchnic glucose up￾take following intravenous insulin and/or intravenous
glucose is small compared to that observed following
oral glucose ingestion (22). Thus, although neither
diminished splanchnic glucose uptake, nor impaired
suppression of hepatic glucose production can account
for the insulin resistance observed in the present study,
further studies are needed to document whether an ab￾normality in hepatic glucose metabolism exists in
uremic subjects following the ingestion of oral glucose.
Studies by Sherwin et al. (23) have shown that the liver
ofchronically uremic subjects displays enhanced sensi￾tivity to the stimulatory effect of glucagon on hepatic
glucose production. In subsequent studies Soman and
Felig (24) suggested that this higher sensitivity was due
to increased glucagon binding to hepatic mem￾branes with a resultant increase in cyclic AMP genera￾tion. Thus, it is possible that during conditions in which
glucagon is increased, i.e., pure protein feeding or a
mixed protein-carbohydrate meal, the suppression of
hepatic glucose production by insulin may be in￾complete.
Only one other study has examined hepatic glucose
production in subjects with chronic renal failure.
Rubenfeld and Garber (25) studied 13 normal-weight,
chronically uremic subjects with a mean serum creat￾566 DeFronzo, Alvestrand, Smith, Hendler, Hendler, and Wahren

inine concentration of 10.7±1.2 mg/dl. They found that
basal hepatic glucose prodtuction in uremic subjects,
2.56 mg/kg min, was increased by 38% compared to
controls, 1.85 mg/kg min (P < 0.05). The ability of in￾sulin to suppress hepatic glucose production was not
examined in this study. Several factors may explain the
higher basal rates of hepatic glucose production re￾ported by these authors. First, they used tritiated glu￾cose labeled in the two position; this is known to over￾estimate glucose turnover because of the presence of
futile cycles (26). Second, their equilibration curve for
tritiated glucose specific activity suggests a failure to
reach an equilibrium plateau; this would also tend to
overestimate hepatic glucose production.
Because both suppression of hepatic glucose produc￾tion and stimulation of splanchnic glucose uptake by
insulin were similar in uremic and control subjects, the
present results suggest that the primary site of insulin
resistance in uremiai resides in peripheral tissues. That
this is indeed the case was confirmed by direct quanti￾tation of insulin-mediated glucose uptake by the leg
in uremic subjects. During the euglycemic insulin
clamp study, leg uptake of glucose was reduced by 60%;
this paralleled closely the 56% decrease in the total
amount of glucose metabolized by the entire body.
These results suggest that the major site of insulini
resistance in uremia resides in the periphery and are
consistent with previous reports using the forearm in￾fusion technique in chronically uremic man (27, 28).
Mondon et al. (29) have reported similar results in rats
made acutely uremic by bilateral nephrectomy. They
found that glucose removal following intravenous
glucose was markedly impaired despite higher insulin
levels, thereby suggesting the presence of insulin resist￾ance. Basal hepatic glucose production, as well as sup￾pression of glucose production by insulin from isolated
perfused livers from uremic rats, was normal. In contrast,
the ability of insulin to enhance glucose uptake by the
isolated perfused hindlimb of uremic rats was markedly
impaired (29).
In summary, the findings of the present study demon￾strate that tissue sensitivity to insulin is inarkedly im￾paired in uremia and that the primary site of this insu￾lin resistance resides in peripheral tissues. The effect
of intravenous insulin on hepatic glucose production
and splanchnic glucose uptake are not altered by
uremia.
