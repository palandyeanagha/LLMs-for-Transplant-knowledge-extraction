Abstract
The stringent regulation of cell cycle progression helps to maintain
genetic stability in cells. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are critical
regulators of gene expression in diverse cellular pathways,
including developmental patterning, hematopoietic differentiation
and antiviral defense. Here, we show that two c-Myc-regulated
miRNAs, miR-17 and miR-20a, govern the transition through G1 in
normal diploid human cells. Inhibition of these miRNAs leads to a
G1 checkpoint due to an accumulation of DNA double-strand
breaks, resulting from premature temporal accumulation of the
E2F1 transcription factor. Surprisingly, gross changes in E2F1 levels
were not required to initiate the DNA damage response and
checkpoint, as these responses could occur with a less than twofold
change in E2F1 protein levels. Instead, our findings indicate that
the precise timing of E2F1 expression dictates S-phase entry and
that accurate timing of E2F1 accumulation requires converging
signals from the Rb/E2F pathway and the c-Myc-regulated miR-17


and miR-20a miRNAs to circumvent a G1 checkpoint arising from
the untimely accumulation of E2F1. These data provide a
mechanistic view of miRNA-based regulation of E2F1 in the context
of the emerging model that miRNAs coordinate the timing of cell
cycle progression.
