ABSTRACT
The rapid emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic is unprecedented and poses an unparalleled obstacle in the
sixty-five year history of organ transplantation. Worldwide, the delivery of transplant care is severely challenged
by matters concerning - but not limited to - organ procurement, risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, screening
strategies of donors and recipients, decisions to postpone or proceed with transplantation, the attributable risk of
immunosuppression for COVID-19 and entrenched health care resources and capacity. The transplant commu￾nity is faced with choosing a lesser of two evils: initiating immunosuppression and potentially accepting det￾rimental outcome when transplant recipients develop COVID-19 versus postponing transplantation and ac￾cepting associated waitlist mortality. Notably, prioritization of health care services for COVID-19 care raises
concerns about allocation of resources to deliver care for transplant patients who might otherwise have excellent
1-year and 10-year survival rates. Children and young adults with end-stage organ disease in particular seem
more disadvantaged by withholding transplantation because of capacity issues than from medical consequences
of SARS-CoV-2. This report details the nationwide response of the Dutch transplant community to these issues
and the immediate consequences for transplant activity. Worrisome, there was a significant decrease in organ
donation numbers affecting all organ transplant services. In addition, there was a detrimental effect on trans￾plantation numbers in children with end-organ failure. Ongoing efforts focus on mitigation of not only primary
but also secondary harm of the pandemic and to find right definitions and momentum to restore the transplant
programs.
1. Introduction
The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is affecting
societies worldwide [1,2]. The scope of this disease is unprecedented
and the global delivery of healthcare is under severe stress [3]. The first
documented case of COVID-19 in the Netherlands, which counts 17.2
million inhabitants, was on February 27, 2020. In less than 60 days,
despite increasingly stringent measures of the Dutch government to halt
the spread of the infection, 28,153 individuals have tested positive for
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), 9127
patients have been admitted to hospitals across the country (of which
2508 in the Intensive Care Units (ICU) [4]) and 3134 have died, ac￾cording to RIVM (National Institute for Public health and the En￾vironment, April 15, 2020) [5]. Because of limited testing capacity
many more, untested individuals are likely infected with SARS-CoV-2 in
the Netherlands. With increasing numbers of COVID-19 patients being
admitted to hospitals, the ability to provide acute, non-COVID-19 care,
is at risk. In this context, especially maintaining organ transplantation
care is complex, as numerous aspects related to donor and recipient
management, need to be taken into account [6–8]. Main questions that
need to be addressed include the following: Under which circumstances
can organ donation from deceased donors take place? Is it safe to
perform transplants from live donors? What are additional risks for
transplant recipients in terms of immunosuppression and COVID-19?
How should potential recipients be managed, both pre- and post￾transplantation? Which treatments should be considered for transplant
recipients with COVID-19? What are logistic implications and, most
importantly, what is the impact of the outbreak on donation and
transplant volumes and waitlist outcomes? The transplant community
in the Netherlands, organized through the Dutch Transplant Society
(DTS/NTV) and the Dutch Transplant Foundation (DTF/NTS, compe￾tent authority), rapidly aligned to reach national agreement on cir￾cumstances under which organ donation and transplant services can be
safeguarded in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. This manuscript
details decisions that our transplant community made collectively in
the first period in absence of solid scientific and clinical evidence while
the pandemic was unfolding. In addition, it demonstrates the im￾mediate devastating effects on donation and transplant volumes and
mortality on the waiting list and preliminary efforts to safely restore the
programs.

2. National and international collaboration
The DTF maintains the national list for patients awaiting organ
transplantation and is responsible for organ donation policy, the allo￾cation of organs through the international organ exchange organization
Eurotransplant (ET), and coordination of the Dutch live donor kidney
paired exchange program. DTF closely collaborates with national organ
advisory committees of the DTS, whose members are content experts
and represent all transplant centers. On March 9th, before the World
Health Organization (WHO) declared the pandemic, the advisory
committees increased their meeting frequency from once every 3 to
6 months in person to ± three times per week through videoconferen￾cing. DTS, DTF and chairs of the advisory committees similarly met to
share the most recent information and policies concerning COVID-19.
Guidelines were made public through internet communications and
newsletters from DTF for both patients and professionals [9]. DTF
participated in bi-weekly meetings with representatives of all ET
members states to learn about developments and issues concerning
national restrictions, donor screening, transport logistics and trans￾plantation activities related to COVID-19. Recommendations published
by RIVM, The Transplant Society [10] and European Centre for Disease
Prevention and Control [11] were swiftly adopted. The existing fra￾mework of collaboration allowed for rapid exchange, first focusing on
how to navigate through the pandemic, followed by tracking down the
consequences for donation and transplant volumes and finding defini￾tions how to restore transplant programs.
3. Developments in hospital capacity
In regard to donation and transplant activity, ICU bed capacity per
million inhabitants is of major importance. Under normal conditions,
the Netherlands has approximately 1150 ICU beds, which is 6.7 ICU
beds per 100.000 people. In comparison: the USA has about 34.7 beds
per 100.000, Germany 29.2, Italy 12.5, France 11.6 and the UK 6.6. In
the current pandemic, hospital capacity and critical care facilities are
severely stressed by the number of COVID-19 patients. In order to
provide optimal care for these patients, a centrally coordinated national
effort was made to double ICU capacity to a total of 2400 in early April
2020. Regular ICU- and medium care, including transplant care was
scaled down to meet this demand. Regarding our concerns for donation
and transplant rates we therefore raised national awareness through
(social) media and by direct contact with the network of intensive care
physicians involved in organ donation and organ tissue transplant co￾ordinators. In addition, a letter was sent to relevant professional orga￾nizations and the national coordination center for capacity. Currently
approximately 500 ICU beds are reserved to allow for (semi-)urgent
non-COVID-19 care, including donation and transplantation.
4. Organ donation from deceased donors
Health care workers (HCW) involved in organ donation are at in￾creased risk of acquiring and spreading SARS-CoV-2, since they work
closely together and travel to various hospitals and visit virus hotspots.
To preserve a safe organ donation chain, recommendations to reduce
the risk of infection of HCW and transplant recipients were made re￾cognizing limitations of available scientific evidence. First, SARS-CoV-2
testing of all deceased donors was implemented, since asymptomatic
carriers and transmission through organ transplantation were deemed
possible [12]. SARS-CoV-2 viral load testing was performed preferably
on endotracheal sputum rather than a swab for increased sensitivity
(Table 1A). When testing is not possible, the donor has been tested
positive or the test result is unknown, organ donation should not pro￾ceed. As viral load tests tend to have long turn-around times, until now
three donor families have retracted their permission for organ donation
during work up at the ICU, because they could not bear the extended
waiting times. So far, no donor has been tested positive for SARS-CoV-2;
in one donor the retrieval procedure was cancelled because of a high
suspicion of COVID-19 based on chest CT, but with a negative PCR. This
was followed by discussions about necessity of CT scan for donor
screening [13]. A CT scan provides rapid information on COVID-19 in
patients with moderate to severe symptoms and is of additional value in
patients with a single false negative nasopharyngeal swab for SARS￾CoV-2 [14]. To date, there is no data on sensitivity and specificity in
asymptomatic patients and therefore not recommended in international
guidelines [15]. The risk of losing additional organ donors because of
false negative COVID-19 associated abnormalities on CT-scan such as
ground-glass opacities and consolidation in e.g. neurogenic oedema is
deemed high. In this light, chest CT-scan is now only used in potential
organ donors with negative nasopharyngeal swab but an inconclusive
history for excluding COVID-19. To maintain social distancing during
organ procurement, additional vehicles for transport to donor hospitals
are used, and chauffeurs and HCW were advised to wear facial personal
protection equipment (PPE). So far, no donation professionals were
infected during procedures. To facilitate extra time needed for recipient
test results to become available, allocation for liver, heart and lung
transplantation is initiated before donor SARS-CoV-2 screening is
known (Table 1A). Additionally, the second recipient on the allocation
list is allocated to minimize risk of donor loss related to prolonged cold
ischemia times. Despite these efforts, donation volumes markedly de￾creased in the first month as the pandemic unfolded (15 March
2020–15 April 2020) compared to the months before (Fig. 1A). The
reasons for this are not completely clear. Traffic has decreased due to
increased working from home, leading to less traffic accidents and
trauma patients becoming organ donors. Also, there have been signs
that people have become more reluctant to call for medical help,
fearing to be a burden for medical professionals or to be infected with
COVID-19 at a health care facility. This could also be the case when
urgent medical assistance is needed, as in acute coronary syndromes,
subarachnoidal bleedings et cetera. Finally, donor awareness among
emergency physicians and intensivists could have decreased due to the
strain put on them by the COVID-19 epidemic. Currently, we are in￾vestigating these issues. Additionally, transport logistics have been a
main challenge in international organ exchange, because of different
policies and restrictions in different countries (e.g. closed national/re￾gional borders; significant drop in air traffic).
5. Organ donation from live donors
In line with international policies, the Dutch transplant community
decided to suspend the majority of living donor transplant programs. It
was considered generally unethical and unsafe to expose healthy in￾dividuals to an operation that would potentially increase their risk of
acquiring SARS-CoV-2 in hospital or developing more significant
COVID-19 postoperatively because of weakened immunity. As a result,
all living-donor kidney transplant programs, a yearly volume of about
500 per year, have halted resulting in approximately 65 cancelled
transplants in the 6 weeks since COVID-19 was first observed in the
Netherlands. A national committee, consisting of relevant stakeholders
including surgeons, nephrologists, ethicists and DTS, DTF and patient
representatives, has been installed to determine under which circum￾stances living-donor kidney transplants can be restored (step-wise) in a
safe and responsible manner. Living-donor pediatric liver transplanta￾tion, with a volume of 15 per year (50% of all pediatric liver trans￾plants), however, continues. The decision to continue this program was
taken after careful consideration of donor risks in view of the lifesaving
nature of the procedure and absence of liver-replacement therapy. In
anticipation of a prolonged period of low numbers of deceased donor
organs, living donation is promoted where possible, and it is decided to
transplant across the ABO blood group barrier in small children.

6. Risks and benefits to transplant recipients
As has been discussed in several other reports, the attributable risk
of immunosuppression on the development and severity of COVID-19 is
unknown. Current knowledge is mainly based on recently published
case reports [16–20]. Previous reports on transplant recipient outcome
for other respiratory viruses and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome
are contradictory [21,22] and several immunosuppressive agents are
even hypothesized to have antiviral properties [23,24]. It is however
evident that frail individuals, including patients with multiple co￾morbidities, are at increased risk of COVID-19 [5].,
One could therefore
argue that transplantation may in fact, in the longer run, ameliorate
that risk. In light of limited and contradictory evidence, and in part
driven by stretched and overwhelmed hospital capacity, the Dutch
transplant community was an early adopter of the recommendations
made by Kumar et al. (Table 1B) [6]. In general, this led to prudence in
performing kidney transplantation until the impact of induction and
maintenance immunosuppression on COVID-19 is more understood.
Deceased-donor kidney transplantation is considered case-by-case in a
shared decision process with the patient, carefully weighing the ur￾gency and benefit of transplantation against risks. This approach al￾lowed for regional differences among centers while sharing a similar
policy. More specifically, kidney and pancreas transplantations for
which T- and/or B-cell depleting induction therapy is deemed necessary
(ABO and Human Leukocyte Antigen-incompatible and other high-im￾munological risk transplantations) are halted. Even though current
evidence suggest that children are generally less impacted by COVID￾19, pediatric kidney transplant programs are restricted similarly to
adult programs. Given the high waiting list mortality and suboptimal or
absent alternative treatment options for end-stage disease, liver-, heart￾and lung-transplantation should continue in principle. For liver it is
agreed that transplantation should continue to be focused on the pa￾tients with the highest need, i.e. high-urgent cases, those with Model for
End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) > 20, or with otherwise life-threa￾tening disease such as hepatocellular carcinoma approaching borders of
Milan criteria (Table 1B). As discussed before, with progression of the
COVID-19 pandemic, ICU capacity across the country is limited. As a
result, per March 25, all heart and lung transplant-centers have limed
their capacity for now to urgent cases with low life expectancy if not
transplanted (Table 1B). It is expected that the need for urgent lung
transplantation may rise in the upcoming weeks for patients with severe
ARDS [25]. As community acquired risk for COVID-19 is high, it is
agreed that COVID-19 positive patients could return on the active organ
waiting list after resolution of clinical symptoms and negative COVID￾19 nasopharyngeal swab or sputum PCR (Table 1B). At this point, there
are no specific criteria for these patients in the ET region, but mono￾organ failure with preserved rehabilitation capacity is generally re￾commended.
Regarding post-transplant care, all elective post-transplant out￾patient care is replaced by telephone and e-consultations when possible.
In addition, centers shared local treatment protocols for transplant re￾cipients. Protocols were based on RIVM recommendations for therapy
and included recommendations on triage (admission versus home
monitoring), adjustment of immunosuppression and drug-drug inter￾actions [26] and international guidelines [27,28]. COVID registries
were started and linked to existing national and international (i.e.,
European ERACODA) databases [29].
7. Impact of the pandemic on transplant activity
The total amount of all organ transplants markedly decreased from
100 to 150 to 40 transplants per month in the first COVID-19 month, a
decrease of 67% (Fig. 1B). This is in contrast to the COVID-19 outbreak
in Italy, were the activity remained stable for each type of solid organ
[30]. However, here the first 4 weeks of the outbreak was taken into
account, while we have taken the period 27th of February till the 15th
of April. Pancreas transplants decreased to 0 and renal transplants from
80 to 100 to 20 per month (Fig. 1C-D). The number of liver and lung
transplants markedly declined from a mean of 16 to 8 per month and
from 18 to 7 per month, respectively, a decrease of approximately 50%
(Fig. 1E-G). There was no pediatric transplant activity in the first
COVID-19 month (Fig. 1H). Related to the focus on patients with the

highest need there was a change in transplantable and non-transplan￾table status on the liver transplantation waiting list as shown in Fig. 2A.
Another alarming and slightly unexpected finding was the higher
number of renal patients removed from the waiting list because of
mortality or deterioration in the first 6 weeks since the first COVID-19
case in the Netherlands was observed (Fig. 2B). It is too early on in the
pandemic to determine cause and effect, and similar trends have not
been observed for other organs yet, but this should be monitored clo￾sely. Effects will become clear in the coming months as centers have
limited capacity for transplantation and screening of new patients. Ef￾forts focus on the right definitions and step-wise momentum to fully
restore the transplant programs.
8. Summary
The COVID-19 pandemic affects the whole chain of organ donation
and transplantation. In the Netherlands the transplant community
quickly aligned. This resulted in the development of new national
guidelines regarding organ donation in the ICU, test requirements for
potential donors and organ recipients and national rules regarding the
acceptance of organs by transplant centers. Worrisome, donation and
transplant volumes markedly decreased and mortality on the waiting
list of renal transplantation increased. The pandemic will have ongoing
effects in the long term. Waiting lists will increase, resulting in in￾creased waiting list mortality and worse pre-operative conditions. It is
therefore of great importance to find the right momentum and defini￾tions under which to fully restore transplant programs.
