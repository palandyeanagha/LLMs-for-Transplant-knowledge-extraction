SUMMARY Aetiological factors were sought prospectively in 55 babies with extrahepatic biliary
atresia, in 105 with neonatal hepatitis, and in 11 with intrahepatic biliary atresia, seen as a result of
nearly complete ascertainment of these conditions in the State of Victoria between 1963 and 1974.
In neonatal hepatitis infective causes were shown in 22 babies, galactosaemia in 6, and ocl-antitrypsin
deficiency in 8; familial occurrence was noted in 10 further babies and unrelated second diseases were
present in 24 of the remaining 59 babies. The only clues to aetiology in extrahepatic biliary atresia
were a suspicion of time-space clusters, a deficiency of affected babies born to young primiparous
women, and an unexpected number of spontaneous abortions in the histories given by the mothers.
Genetic factors appeared to be important in intrahepatic biliary atresia, but are not reported in detail.
Hypotheses for the aetiology of neonatal hepatitis and of extrahepatic biliary atresia are presented.
Both are considered syndromes with multiple causes. Recurrence risks in sibs are discussed, and are
1 in 7 for neonatal hepatitis of unknown cause, negligible in extrahepatic biliary atresia, and usually
1 in 2 or 1 in 4 in intrahepatic biliary atresia, depending upon the family history.
Neonatal hepatitis was first distinguished from
biliary atresia by Craig and Landing in 1952.
Intrahepatic biliary atresia was recognized later.
The aetiology of all 3 conditions remains ill-defined.
A prospective study was started in Melbourne
in July 1963 and has included nearly all cases born
in Victoria since. The aetiological factors discovered
in 55 babies with extrahepatic biliary atresia
(EHBA), in 11 with intrahepatic biliary atresia
(IHBA), and in 105 with neonatal hepatitis (NNH)
seen in the 11-year period up to December 1974
are reported.
Definitions
EHBA. Atresia of part or all of the extrahepatic
bile duct system (including right and left hepatic
ducts) causing complete obstruction of bile flow.
EHBA was proved by laparotomy, cholangiography,
and subsequent follow-up. Every inoperable case
was followed to death with necropsy examination
in all but 3 patients. Those who have drained
bile after some form of anastomotic surgery have
been followed since (Danks et al., 1974).
Received 31 August 1976
IHBA. A curious disease in which the late anatomical
features (after 1 year of age) comprise a fine patent
extrahepatic bile duct system and absence, or
extreme reduction, of the interlobular ducts normally
seen in the portal tracts (Alagille et al., 1975).
It is sometimes called biliary hypoplasia (Longmire,
1964). The early microscopical features may be
indistinguishable from NNH. Patency of the
major ducts was established by clearing of jaundice,
by cholangiography, or at necropsy. A distinction
was made from NNH by follow-up.
NNH. This was defined by microscopical changes
in the liver in 88 babies. The remaining 17 babies
were accepted because of jaundice of an obstructive
type lasting more than 4 weeks. Prompt demon￾stration of the aetiology was the reason for not
performing a biopsy in many of these babies.
Most patients were jaundiced and onset before
4 weeks was demanded. Anicteric babies presenting
with steatorrhoea or hypoprothrombinaemia were
accepted up to 6 weeks of age. Patency of the bile
ducts was established by clearing of jaundice, at
laparotomy or at necropsy.
The microscopical features of NNH have been
described fully elsewhere (Smith et al., 1977).

Studies of the aetiology of neonatal hepatitis and biliary atresia 361
The key features are small foci of liver cell necrosis
with cellular infiltration and condensation of
reticulin, distortion of the parenchymal cell arrange￾ment by variability in cell size and shape with
bi- and trinucleate cells, or multinucleate giant
cells, accompanied only by mild inflammation
and duct proliferation in the portal tracts.
Methods
Ascertainment. Careful assessment has shown that
all cases of EHBA in Victoria were included in
the study and over 80% of all clinically apparent
cases of NNH and IHBA. The criteria used to
define NNH have excluded mild cases with transient
jaundice or late onset of symptoms. A few additional
cases were referred from other States, but these
were excluded when calculating the incidence of
the conditions.
Analysis of time-space distribution of cases. Analysis
was confined to patients with EHBA and to non￾familial cases of NNH born in metropolitan
Melbourne. The patients were listed in chronological
sequence of birth dates and their birth places were
marked on a scale map of metropolitan Melbourne.
The product (time interval in days between birth
dates x distances in miles between birth places)
was calculated for pairs of cases taken in birth
date sequence, and the mean was calculated. This
mean was compared with the mean value of this
product for all possible pairs of cases, using a
't' test. The method is a slight variation on that of
Knox (1971). Another chronological list of all
cases, rural and urban, was prepared for visual
inspection.
Investigations. Virus isolation studies were performed
on a throat swab and on one or more urine samples.
Standard procedures were used to grow and identify
rubella and cytomegalovirus (CMV) in monkey
kidney cell cultures and in human fetal fibroblast
cell cultures respectively. CMV complement-fixing
antibodies were measured in serum using the
RCH strain 234 antigen. Toxoplasma serology was
performed by complement fixation and/or by
immunofluorescence. Hepatitis B surface antigen
was sought by solid phase radioimmunoassay
and antibody by radioimmune precipitation (Dr.
Ian Gust, Fairfield Hospital for Communicable
Diseases).
A screening test (Beutler and Baluda, 1968)
was used to exclude galactosaemia and positive
diagnoses were confirmed by measurement of
hexose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase activity in
red blood cells. Urine was tested for sugar with
Clinitest (Ames Co.) with paper chromatography of
samples containing sugar. Aminoaciduria was
detected by two-dimension paper chromatography
until 1971, and by high voltage electrophoresis
on paper since then.
oc1-antitrypsin (a1AT) deficiency was detected by
measuring the trypsin inhibiting capacity of serum
using benzoyl arginine p-nitroanilide hydrochloride
as substrate (Eriksson, 1965) until 1970 and by
radial immunodiffusion (Behringwerke plates) since.
Samples with low levels and samples from relevant
family members were subsequently Pi typed (by
Dr. Magne Fagerhol of Oslo). All other measure￾ments were made by standard laboratory methods.
Results
Infective agents. The results of virus studies and
serological tests for syphilis and toxoplasmosis
are set out in Table 1. CMV can certainly be
regarded as causative in 7 babies with NNH and
was probably the cause in 13 (15 %). It was also

isolated from 1 baby with congenital syphilis and
1 with m.1AT deficiency. In 3 patients (2 EHBA)
initial CMV studies were negative and subsequent
samples contained the virus. These were regarded
as instances of postnatal infection with this agent.
Rubella virus was isolated from throat and/or
urine of 2 babies with NNH, and from 1 with
IHBA. The baby girl with IHBA had pulmonary
artery stenosis, retinopathy, and osteopathy, and
the rubella virus was regarded as the cause of
her disease. However, the subsequent birth of an
identically affected brother cast serious doubt on
this interpretation. One baby with positive serology
for toxoplasmosis died of gross cerebral destruction.
The other was only mildly affected.
Viruses were isolated from multiple tissues of
3 babies who died of illnesses resembling septicaemia
with jaundice, haemorrhages, and hepatospleno￾megaly. The agents were Coxsackie B2, Coxsackie
B4, and parainfluenza type 3 respectively. The
only baby with HB surface antigen and antibody
was born to an opiate addict.
Galactosaemia and galactosuria. 6 babies who
presented with a clinical problem of NNH proved
to have galactosaemia. Galactosuria of a heavy
and persistent type was encountered in 2 babies
with NNH who had normal levels of hexose-1-
phosphate uridyl transferase in their red cells.
Both babies were quite ill and were treated with
lactose-free feeds with marked clinical improvement
shortly after the change in feeding. Subsequent
reintroduction of lactose caused no ill effects.
This was interpreted as galactose intolerance
secondary to liver disease of another cause.
ocAT deficiency. Definite deficiency was shown
and confirmed by finding Pi ZZ phenotypes in
6 babies with NNH out of 54 tested. 2 other babies
with levels low enough to indicate homozygous
cx,AT deficiency were unavailable for Pi typing.
Homozygous oc1AT deficiency was excluded in
25 babies with EHBA and 9 with IHBA.
Incidence of diseases. Among 790 385 children born
in Victoria during the study period, 55 had EHBA
(6- 96/100 000 live births, or 1 in 14 000 approxi￾mately), 99 had NNH (12-53/100000 live births,
1 in 8000 approximately), and 11 had IHBA
(1 *39/100 000 live births, or 1 in 70 000
approximately). The total incidence of neonatal
liver disease was 1 in 5000 live births.
Maternal age and birth order. The distribution of
maternal age and number of previous live births
for patients with each disease was compared with
the distribution of these parameters for all live
births in Victoria in the same years (Demography,
1963-1973). Tables were not available for 1973 or
1974, and 1972 figures were used for babies born
in these years. No significant deviation from
expectation was observed for NNH. However,
maternal age (0-001<P<0-01) had a strong
positive effect upon the occurrence of EHBA.
Birth order showed a less striking effect
(0-02<P<0-05). However, the data in Table 2
show a striking deficiency of first-born babies
of young mothers rather than an excess of babies
born to older mothers. Miscarriages and stillbirths
were excluded from the calculations and the EHBA
mothers had a remarkable number of miscarriages
(Table 3), most of which occurred before the birth
of the affected child. The total number of previous
pregnancies would have been much larger than
the figures in Table 2 show.
Familial occurrence. The data in Table 3 were
recorded at interviews of both parents (whenever
possible) by one of two authors. Information
regarding aunts, uncles, and cousins was incomplete
in some families. Illnesses in relatives were confirmed
from hospitals or doctors in nearly all instances.
The most definite finding was the occurrence of
NNH in sibs. Correction for ascertainment bias
was achieved by counting the sibs of index cases
and by including each family once for each index
case giving 12 affected among 81 sibs, or a proportion
0-149±0 040 affected. This figure is lower than
the 0 250 expected in recessive inheritance. NNH
can be excluded as the cause of 6 of the 8 neonatal
deaths among the sibs of index cases (Table 3),
but remains a possibility in the other 2. One baby
had the syndrome of persistent cholestatic jaundice
and lymphoedema described by Aagenaes et al.
(1968; Aagenaes, 1974). A sib of this patient died
in the newborn period without defined cause.
All the affected sibs were male, though the index
case was female in one of these sibships. The
pedigrees provided no real support for X-linked
recessive inheritance. No familial occurrence of
EHBA was encountered. The remarkable number
of miscarriages in these families has been mentioned.
All the babies with IHBA had unusual facies
(Alagille et al., 1975), and 8 had pulmonary artery
stenosis, pulmonary valve stenosis, or pulmonary
atresia. Among the 11 index cases were a brother
and sister each with the full syndrome including
severe pulmonary artery stenosis and hypoplasia.
One of these babies had also suffered intrauterine
infection with rubella (see above). Two maternal
uncles of another child were affected by IHBA
and the mother and child had a similar unusual

2 years elapsed without a case of EHBA and two
12-month periods yielded 9 and 12 cases respectively,
compared to the annual average of 5 cases per year.
Consideration of place of birth increased this
suspicion of time-space clustering. For instance,
Geelong, the second city of Victoria, produced
the anticipated number of cases in the whole of
12 years; however, the 6 patients were born in
2 clusters of 6 months each. A small country town
(population 10 000) produced 2 cases in 3 months.
Two neighbouring outer suburbs of Melbourne
contributed 4 cases in 4 months.
The extreme differences in population density
in urban and rural Victoria have thwarted attempts
to devise a meaningful index of spatial dispersion
appropriate to both. Analysis of urban cases only
showed a significant departure from random time￾space distribution (P<0 05) for EHBA, but not
for NNH.

sex ratios in each aetiological category of NNH
are presented in Table 4. There was a significant

excess of males with NNH of unknown aetiology,
and among the familial cases of NNH.
Consanguinity. There was only one consanguineous
mating, between Italian first cousins, who produced
2 babies who died of NNH. The first died at 4 months
after an illness marked by chronic haemolytic
anaemia and progressive cerebral degeneration in
addition to the liver disease. The second died a
few hours after birth and the liver disease was
diagnosed at necropsy.
Birthweight and gestational age. Birthweight and
gestational age of each baby was plotted on curves
derived for normal babies in this community
(Kitchen, 1968) and the results are presented by
centile groupings (Tables 5, 6). Probabilities derived
by x2 analysis of these numbers indicated a low
birthweight in NNH caused by infective agents,
and both low birthweight and premature delivery
in babies with NNH of unknown cause.
Maternal illness and medication. This was recorded
in a standardized manner for 45 babies with EHBA
and 53 of the babies with NNH of unknown
aetiology. No control group was available but
comparison of the two diseases showed no difference
in the frequency or nature of illnesses or
complications during pregnancy. Drug consumption
was similar except that iron was taken by 23 mothers
of babies with EHBA and by only 9 mothers of
babies with NNH.
Second diseases. Second diseases were identified
in 24 of the 59 babies with NNH of unknown cause
with negative family histories (Table 7). Second
diseases were not encountered among babies with
NNH of known cause, and were present in only
3 of 58 babies with EHBA. Pulmonary valve and/or
pulmonary artery abnormalities and unusual facies
have been mentioned already in IHBA.
Bile duct remnants in EHBA. These remnants were
studied systematically. The macroscopical
appearances at operation were recorded personally
by one author (D.M.D.) as thick fibrous cords
(14 cases), fine fibrous strands (16 cases), swollen

Microscopical sections of fibrous remnants
removed at operation were examined in 12 patients
and the findings were as described by Kasai (1974),
i.e. whorls of fibrous tissue around islands of duct
epithelium with some inflammatory cells.
Postnatal development of EHBA. In 6 babies
completely acholic stools developed only some
weeks or months after the onset of jaundice. The
bile-containing stools passed by these babies had
been seen repeatedly by the authors. The initial
needle liver biopsies showed changes strongly
suggestive of NNH in each of these babies, but the
microscopical feature of mechanical obstruction
to bile ducts developed later. The acutely inflamed
bile duct described above was found in one of these
babies.
Discussion
Neonatal hepatitis. The broad definition of NNH
used in this article inevitably means that multiple
aetiologies will be found. However, any more
restrictive definition is even less satisfactory.
Definable intrauterine infections were responsible
for approximately 20% of NNH (CMV 12%,
toxoplasmosis 2 %, other agents 6 %). The rigid
criteria used may have underestimated the role
of CMV, but occurrence of early postnatal CMV
infection creates a dilemma which cannot be resolved
satisfactorily. Galactosaemia accounted for 5 %
of cases but hereditary fructose intolerance and
hereditary tyrosinaemia were not encountered.
Unfortunately the data on c.1AT deficiency was
incomplete-a figure between 6 out of 54 (11 %)
and 8 out of 54 (15%) can be estimated, and agrees
with published figures.
The patients with NNH in whom all aetiological
tests proved negative offer the most interesting
challenge. A number of characteristics of this
group can be described-premature delivery, low
birthweight for maturity, striking excess of males,
occurrence in sibs with a frequency of about 15 %,
and occurrence of a second disease in 40 % of
those patients who have no affected sibs. This
group is almost certainly heterogeneous. Recessively
inherited conditions seem certain in at least 3
families-the consanguineous couple who produced
2 affected babies, another couple who produced
4 healthy girls and 3 sons who died of acute liver
failure at about 1 week of age (Danks, 1974), and
the baby with Aagenaes's syndrome (1974). Other re￾cessively inherited conditions may exist in this group.
A different hypothesis is advanced to explain the
majority of cases of NNH. We suggest that trans￾placental infection by one of many infective agents
capable of damaging the liver is fairly common
(e.g. occurs in 5-10% of pregnancies) but generally
causes no noticeable illness, and that the various
second diseases encountered in this study predispose
some fetuses to develop overt disease. Unrecognized
genetic factors may act in this way, and so may

are known to be associated with increased
susceptibility to infection (e.g. Down's syndrome,
chondrodysplasia punctata), and others cause some

liver damage (cystic fibrosis, Niemann-Pick disease),
or place an unusual load on liver function (e.g.
haemolytic disease of the newborn).
The circumstances encountered in haemolytic
disease of the newborn (HDN) provide some support
for this hypothesis. When needle liver biopsy has
been performed in babies with HDN and persistently
raised conjugated bilirubin in the serum ('inspissated
bile syndrome'), it has always shown changes of
mild NNH. HDN subjects the liver to a bilirubin
load, and might cause jaundice in babies with
subclinical NNH. These patients should have a
good prognosis-this is true. The frequency of
the 'inspissated bile syndrome' in HDN should
give an estimate of the frequency of subclinical
NNH in the newborn. This is the origin of the
5-10% figure suggested above. This figure should
also indicate the proportion of pregnant women
harbouring agents capable of causing hepatitis
and should correspond to the frequency of sub￾clinical hepatitis after blood transfusion-also
5-10% (Hampers et al., 1964; Creutzfeldt et al.,
1966; Proskey et al., 1970). This figure is much
higher than the frequency of HBs antigenaemia,
and other agents must be proposed in addition
to the hepatitis B (Knodell et al., 1975). Intrauterine
transfusions in severe HDN should raise the
frequency of the 'inspissated bile syndrome' by
exposing the fetus to donor blood in addition to
the mother-this is also true.
Many reports describe the occurrence of NNH
in babies with other serious diseases of infancy,
e.g. trisomy E (Alpert et al., 1969), Niemann-Pick
disease (Ivemark et al., 1963; Ashkenazi et al.,
1971). It seems more reasonable to propose that
most of the diseases listed in Table 7 act by non￾specifically increasing susceptibility to agents capable
of causing hepatitis than to claim that each can
specifically cause a liver lesion in an occasional
baby. The baby with polycystic kidneys is of interest
in this regard. A subsequent sib was born with
identical polycystic kidneys and bile duct dysplasia,
but did not have clinical or microscopical evidence
of NNH.
Extrahepatic biliary atresia. In EHBA there was
no familial occurrence, the birthweight and sex
ratio were unremarkable, and there was suspicion
(but not proof) of time-space clustering. The
existence of inflammatory changes in the fibrous
duct remnants was an important feature.
The following hypothesis is advanced for the
aetiology of EHBA.
(1) Most cases of EHBA are the result of inflam￾matory destruction of previously formed bile
ducts during a cholangitic hepatitis. (2) The hepatitis
is probably caused by an agent or agents different
from those involved in NNH-probably one or
several uncommon agents each causing disease
in most fetuses infected. This suggestion is made
to explain the striking differences between EHIBA
and NNH with regard to predisposing diseases
and familial occurrence.
This hypothesis differs from that of Landing
(1974) who suggests a common aetiology for NNH
and EHBA. The great differences in the data about
the two diseases presented here make this suggestion
very unlikely. A single cause for either disease seems
improbable, leave alone one cause for both diseases.
No explanation of the excessive frequency of
miscarriage in pregnancies conceived before the
EHIBA babies is apparent.
Intrahepatic biliary atresia. Reports of familial
occurrence of IHIBA have appeared in recent
years (Alagille et al., 1975). Heterogeneity seems
probable even within the cases seen in Melbourne.
The distribution in 2 families would suggest
autosomal dominant inheritance of IHBA,
pulmonary stenosis, and a characteristic facies
with considerable variation from patient to patient,
while autosomal recessive inheritance seems more
likely in another family.
Knowledge of aetiology may allow logical treat￾ment eventually and will allow counselling about
future pregnancies. The present study and past
studies (Hsia et al., 1958; Danks and Bodian, 1963)
show that parents of babies with NNH of unknown
cause must be given guarded advice-about 1 in 7
of subsequent babies will be affected. In EHBA
the risk of a second affected baby must be very
low. The larger studies of this condition (Hsia
etal., 1958; Danks and Bodian, 1963; present study)
contain no family with a second case among a
total of 142 families. Several papers have reported
individual families claimed to contain 2 or more
babies with EHBA (Nevin et al., 1969). However,
careful study of the patients reported shows that some
date from the period before NNH was distinguished
from EHBA and that most of the more recent cases
have suffered from the unusual entity of EHBA
plus IHB3A. Like IH13A, this condition does show
a definite familial occurrence.
We acknowledge the assistance of the many people
who contributed to this long-term prospective
study, especially the referring paediatricians, the
surgeons who operated on the babies with biliary
atresia, and laboratory staff of the Royal Children's
Hospital. Drs. Kathleen Hayes and John Connelly
gave particular assistance with the laboratory
investigations.
