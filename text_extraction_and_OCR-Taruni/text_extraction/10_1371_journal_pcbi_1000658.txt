Abstract
Acute effects of sex steroid hormones likely contribute to the observation that post-pubescent males have shorter QT
intervals than females. However, the specific role for hormones in modulating cardiac electrophysiological
parameters and arrhythmia vulnerability is unclear. Here we use a computational modeling approach to incorporate
experimentally measured effects of physiological concentrations of testosterone, estrogen and progesterone on
cardiac ion channel targets. We then study the hormone effects on ventricular cell and tissue dynamics comprised of
Faber-Rudy computational models. The ‘‘female’’ model predicts changes in action potential duration (APD) at
different stages of the menstrual cycle that are consistent with clinically observed QT interval fluctuations. The
‘‘male’’ model predicts shortening of APD and QT interval at physiological testosterone concentrations. The model
suggests increased susceptibility to drug-induced arrhythmia when estradiol levels are high, while testosterone and
progesterone are apparently protective. Simulations predict the effects of sex steroid hormones on clinically
observed QT intervals and reveal mechanisms of estrogen-mediated susceptibility to prolongation of QT interval. The
simulations also indicate that acute effects of estrogen are not alone sufficient to cause arrhythmia triggers and
explain the increased risk of females to Torsades de Pointes. Our results suggest that acute effects of sex steroid
hormones on cardiac ion channels are sufficient to account for some aspects of gender specific susceptibility to long￾QT linked arrhythmias.

Introduction
In the past decade, studies have suggested that female gender is
an independent risk factor for long-QT (LQT) dependent cardiac
arrhythmias [1–3]. Since the differences in QT intervals in males
and females appear from the time of puberty [4,5], sex steroid
hormone effects on cardiac repolarization have been implicated.
Clinical studies have found no difference in QT interval in male
and female children, but shorter QT intervals in men versus
women under age 50 [4]. The international Long QT syndrome
(LQTS) registry 1998 reported that females had higher risk of a
first cardiac event between 15 and 40 years [6]. Moreover, clinical
findings observed that more than 68% of drug-induced torsade de
pointes (TdP) occur in women [7–9].
It is known that one way that sex steroid hormones cause
functional physiological changes is via transcriptional regulation.
Sex hormones may bind to sex hormone receptors and then
translocate into the nucleus. In the nucleus, a ligand-bound sex
hormone receptor acts a transcription factor by binding to the
promoter region of genes containing a hormone responsive
element (HRE), leading to regulation of gene expression. For
example, in the heart, lipocalin-type prostaglandli D synthase (L￾PDGS) has been found to be transcriptionally upregulated by
estradiol and estrogen receptor (ER) [10]. This genomic action
requires several hours before the effects can be observed. In
addition to the genomic pathway, sex steroid hormones may
induce a rapid activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase
(MAPK) leading to transcription factor activation [11,12] as well
as activation of membrane bound endothelial nitric oxide synthase
(eNOS) [13,14].
Interestingly, recent studies have demonstrated that sex steroid
hormones may also act acutely and rapidly modulate cardiac ion
channel activity directly via a PI3K/Akt/eNOS pathway [15–17].
Testosterone induced phosphorylation of the Ser/Thr kinase Akt
and eNOS leads to NO synthase 3 (NOS3) activation and
production of nitric oxide (NO) [15]. NO leads to s-nitrosylation of
cysteine residues on the channel underlying the slow delayed
rectifier K+ current (IKs) [17]. L-type Ca2+ current (ICa,L) is
conversely suppressed by NO via a cGMP dependent pathway.
Regulation of IKs and ICa,L by testosterone is dose-dependent [15]
and leads to shortening of action potential duration (APD) [15]
and QT intervals [18–20]. In adult men, the serum testosterone
level is reported to be 10 to 35 nM [21], however circulating levels
of testosterone begin to decline in men as young as 40 [22]. QT
intervals are shorter in adult men than in adult women until
around the age of 50 [4], suggesting a likely role for circulating
testosterone.

In females, progesterone fluctuates through the menstrual cycle.
The reported serum progesterone level is 2.5 nM in the follicular
phase and 40.6 nM in the luteal phase [23]. It was recently shown
by Nakamura et al. that progesterone increases IKs current
through the NO production pathways and prevents cAMP￾enhancement of ICa,L [16].
The apparent result of acute effects of progesterone and
testosterone is to shorten ventricular repolarization and diminish
incidence of arrhythmias [15,16,20,24]. Recently, experiments
have suggested protective effects of testosterone against arrhyth￾mia. In vivo experiments show that orchiectomized male rabbits
treated with dihydrotestosterone (DHT) had shorter QT interval
and APD90 compared to non-DHT treated rabbits [18,20]. Also,
experiments in testosterone treated female animals have shown
that DHT reduces drug-induced arrhythmia by dofetilide [24].
The acute effects of estradiol result in suppression of human
ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG) underlying the rapid delayed
rectifier current (IKr) by directly binding to the channel, altering
channel kinetics and reducing current [25]. Kurokawa and co￾workers showed that 17b-estradiol (E2) increases the channel rate
of closure (deactivation) and lessens repolarizing current. They
also showed that in the presence of E2, hERG is more sensitive to
block by drugs. The group proposed that aromatic centroid of E2
may be responsible for increasing the sensitivity of hERG block by
E4031 via interaction with the aromatic side chain of Phe656 and
aromatic rings of the hERG blocker. Because 1) the concentration
of E2 is not constant through the menstrual cycle, but rather
fluctuates from the peak follicular phase serum E2 level of 1 nM to
0.7 nM in the luteal phase, and 2) E2 has dramatic effects on
sensitivity to hERG block within this range, it stands to reason that
susceptibility to drug-induced arrhythmia by hERG block may
vary through the menstrual cycle.
Although studies have shown that female hormones estradiol
and progesterone have opposite effects on cardiac repolarization:
E2 prolongs QT intervals, and progesterone reduces QT interval
[16,25,26], the question of whether normal hormonal fluctuations
are sufficient to account for variability in QT during the menstrual
cycle in not known. Neither are the effects of physiological
concentrations of hormones on arrhythmia susceptibility well
understood. Some studies do report that dynamic fluctuations in
QT intervals during the menstrual cycle are related to changes in
susceptibility to TdP risk [27,28]. Other studies in postmenopausal
women also suggest the importance of female hormones as
estrogen hormone replacement therapy prolongs QT intervals and
increases arrhythmia risk [26,29,30]. Other data have not found
marked fluctuation in QT interval during specific phases of the
menstrual cycle [28,31,32]. Burke et al., (1997) found that the
corrected QT (QTc) interval does not significantly change through
menstrual cycle in pre-menopausal women; however, QTc is
reduced in the luteal phase after autonomic blockade [31]. A study
of drug-induced QT prolongation during the menstrual cycle
observed that QTc did not vary during the menstrual cycle, but
QTc shortening was more pronounced in the luteal phase with
ibutilide application [28]. Nonetheless, both the clinical and
experimental data suggest that women have both longer QT
intervals than men and are more likely to develop long-QT
dependent arrhythmias and TdP arrhythmias [9,28]. Women are
especially susceptible to increased arrhythmia risk in response to
QT-prolongation drugs [9,28,33,34].
It is a major challenge to specifically determine the relationship
between sex steroid hormones and arrhythmia susceptibility in
males and females since the cardiac system is extraordinarily
complex. In order to attribute risk to a particular parameter, in
this case physiologically relevant concentrations of sex steroid
hormones, the specific effect must be studied in isolation without
other perturbations to the system. This is the strength of the
computational approach that we employ. In the present study, we
focus on acute effects of sex steroid hormones on cardiac ion
channel targets. We use guinea pig models that incorporate the
effects of hormones measured experimentally from guinea pig, and
then can test these changes specifically within the complex cellular
and tissue milieu.
Importantly, we use the model to make predictions about the
effects of physiological concentrations of sex steroid hormones on
gender specific cardiac physiology parameters and arrhythmia
susceptibility. Some recent experimental studies investigating
functional effects of sex hormones on cardiac function have
utilized hormone concentrations in the micromolar range that is
orders of magnitude higher than the nanomolar physiological
circulating concentration of E2 [35]. This is a critical consider￾ation because micromolar concentrations of E2 are apparently
cardioprotective via effects on L-type Ca2+ current (ICa,L).
Although high hormone concentrations may be relevant during
phases such as pregnancy, a recent study showed that E2 at 1 nM
did not have significant effects on IKs or ICa,L [25]. Our model
simulations reproduce observed fluctuations of QT through the
menstrual cycle in females in both cell and tissue-level. Simulations
also predict that effects of testosterone and progesterone on ion
channels hasten repolarization and protect from drug-induced
arrhythmias.
Results
Sex steroid hormones effects on cardiac ion channels
To investigate the acute effects of sex steroid hormone on cardiac
electrophysiology and arrhythmia susceptibility, we developed a
computational model that mimicked the conditions employed
experimentally so that we could directly validate our model by
comparison to experimental measurements. Experiments were
conducted in isolated ventricular myocytes from Langendorff￾perfused adult female guinea pigs, so that they were free of
endogenous neuronal and hormonal effects. The isolated cells were
then incubated with human physiological concentrations of
hormones for 10 min. and the effects of hormones on cardiac ion
Author Summary
It is well known that female gender is an independent risk
factor for some types of cardiac arrhythmias. However, it
has been difficult to determine how much of a role
physiological concentrations of circulating sex steroid
hormones play in gender linked arrhythmia susceptibility
because the cardiac system is so extraordinarily complex.
Here we employ a computational strategy, based on
experimental measurements, to tease out the individual
contributions of estrogen, progesterone and testosterone
on cardiac electrical behavior and then make predictions
about their effects in combination and in the presence of
drugs. The computational models convincingly reproduce
observed fluctuations of QT intervals (as recorded on the
ECG (electrocardiogram), the QT interval reflects the time
period between ventricular excitation and relaxation)
through the menstrual cycle in females and effects of
testosterone on ECG parameters. Our simulations also
predict that testosterone and progesterone are protective
against drug-induced arrhythmias, while estrogen likely
exacerbates the breakdown of normal cardiac electrical
activity in the presence of QT-prolonging drugs.

channels were measured. A range of cardiac ion channels were
screened for functional changes induced by sex steroid hormones,
but acute effects of progesterone were found only to modify IKs [16]
while testosterone primarily increased IKs and inhibited ICa,L [15];
acute E2 treatment only significantly suppressed IKr current [25].
We utilized the experimentally observed effects of physiological
concentrations of sex-steroid hormones in adult women and men
and incorporated these functional changes into our computational
models (described in detail in Supplemental Text S1).
Experiments [25] show that E2 primarily affects the conduc￾tance of IKr, and has a minor, but measurable and significant effect
on slowing channel activation kinetics. To simulate the experi￾mentally observed IKr current reduction by E2 (Figure 1A – right),
we scaled the IKr conductance and incorporated the minor effects
of E2 on the voltage dependence (not shown) of IKr in the model
(Figure 1A – left). E2 at 1 nM reduced IKr tail current in a dose￾dependent manner, but did not affect the time course of tail
current decay (Figure 1A).
Unlike the direct effects of E2 on IKr, progesterone modulates the
IKs through non-genomic activation of eNOS. We used experi￾mental data [16] (Figure 1B – left traces) to scale the conductance of
ionic currents in the model to incorporate effects of progesterone on
IKs. Progesterone-induced IKs enhancement is concentration￾dependent as shown in Figure 1B. Experimentally recorded and
simulated dose-response curves for progesterone effects on IKs tail
current amplitude is shown in Supplemental Figure S1. IKs current
was simulated with different concentrations corresponding to
progesterone concentrations at various points in the menstrual
cycle (0 nM – control case, 2.5 nM – follicular phase, 40.6 nM –
luteal phase and 100 nM - maximal experimental concentration)
during a voltage pulse from 240 mV to +50 mV. Note that the
effect of progesterone on IKs is nearly saturated at a concentration of
40.6 nM, corresponding to the peak value during the luteal phase of
the menstrual cycle (indicated by the near overlay of the 100 nM
curve).
Like progesterone, testosterone modifies cardiac ion channels
comprising IKs and ICa,L via eNOS production of NO. We used
the same method as above to incorporate experimental ratios of
control conductance for testosterone. Dose-dependent effects of
testosterone on IKs enhancement and ICa,L suppression are shown
in Figure 1C for experiments (top) and simulated currents (lower
panels). Simulated IKs and ICa,L are compared to experimentally
recorded guinea pig IKs and ICa,L using the same protocol. Cells
were depolarized to test potential +50 mV for 3.5 seconds and
then repolarized to 240 mV to record IKs. ICa,L was experimen￾tally recorded during a voltage step from 240 mV to 0 mV.
Testosterone strongly enhances IKs current (Figure 1C – left traces)
at 10 nM while high concentrations of testosterone (300 nM)
markedly suppress ICa,L (Figure 1C – right traces).
Simulated effects of hormones on action potentials in
single cells
Like humans, many studies have demonstrated that female
guinea pigs have slower repolarization than male guinea pigs
[1,36]. To examine the contribution of sex-steroid hormones on
the ventricular action potential duration (APD), we included the
effects of E2, progesterone and testosterone on membrane currents
and simulated action potentials (APs) in three cell types. Figure 2
shows APs for the 50th beat at 1000 ms pacing rate in M cells.
Simulated APs of epicardial and endocardial cells are described in
Supplemental Figure S2.
E2-induced IKr suppression contributes to APD prolongation in
a dose-dependent manner (Figure 2A). A low concentration of E2
(0.1 nM), corresponding to the early follicular phase of the
menstrual cycle, has slight effects on APD compared with control
case (from 233 to 235 ms — 0.86% prolongation). However, a
concentration of E2 corresponding to the late follicular phase of
the menstrual cycle (prior to ovulation) (1.0 nM) prolonged APD
(250 ms) by 7.3% (Figure 2A). This value is in good agreement
with the observed APD prolongation in guinea pig myocytes in
patch-clamp experiments with E2 incubation (1161%) [25].
Figure 2B shows that progesterone reduced APD in a concentra￾tion-dependent manner (222 ms — 4.7% reduction at 2.5 nM
corresponding to the follicular phase; 212 ms — 9.0% reduction at
40.6 nM, corresponding to the luteal phase), which agrees with
patch-clamp experimental data (6.3% reduction at 40.6 nM) [16].
To investigate the combined effects of E2 and progesterone as
they fluctuate during the normal menstrual cycle on the cardiac
action potential, we used clinically measured concentrations of
hormones at three discrete phases of the menstrual cycle (early
follicular, late follicular and luteal). During the early follicular
stage, E2 = 0.1 nM, progesterone = 2.5 nM, during the late
follicular stage, E2 = 1.0 nM, progesterone = 2.5 nM and during
the luteal stage, E2 = 0.7 nM, progesterone = 40.6 nM [23]. As see
in Figure 2C, the simulations predict longer APD in the late
follicular phase (233 ms) than in the early follicular (223 ms —
4.3% reduction). Simulations predict shortest APD in the luteal

phase (218 ms — 6.4% reduction), consistent with experimental
observations (<11% shortening) [36].
We also simulated changes in APD at two physiological
concentrations of testosterone (10 nM and 35 nM) shown in
Figure 2D, which reflect the normal low and high ranges found in
post-pubescent pre-senescent males [21]. The simulations predict
marked APD shortening by 10.7% (208 ms) and 15.9% (196 ms)
at 10 and 35 nM testosterone, respectively.
Simulation of tissue-level effects of hormones
We next computed the effects of sex-steroid hormones in a one￾dimensional strand of coupled M cells (results from other cell types
are shown in Supplemental Figure S2) to determine the effects of
hormones in an electrotonically coupled system (Figure 3). We also
computed spatial gradients of depolarization and repolarization to
generate a pseudo ECG electrogram (Figure 3B). APs were
initiated via a stimulus applied to the first cell and then propagated
from top to bottom along the 1 cm fiber. Figure 3A show that the
first cell fired first and then repolarized first.
The effects of E2 on IKr leads to dose-dependent APD
prolongation in the simulated tissue (Figure 3A), and results in a
longer QT interval in the presence of 1 nM (7.7% prolongation)
from 260 ms (Figure 3A-i — 0 nM sex-steroid hormone) to
280 ms as seen in Figure 3B (top panel). Also, the simulations
clearly show progesterone shortened APD in a dose-dependent
manner (3A-iv 2.5 nM, and 3A-v 40.6 nM). The corresponding
computed electrograms from the fibers in Figure 3B (lower panel)
demonstrates the progesterone-induced QT interval reduction
from 260 ms (control case) to 250 ms (3.8% — iv) and 240 ms
(7.7% — v).
A recent clinical study has observed that the QT intervals
fluctuate during the menstrual cycle, suggesting that progesterone
may reverse effects of the estrogen-induced QT prolongation [27].
Figure 4A represents the results of simulations in a 1D cable at
combined hormone concentrations observed during various
phases of the menstrual cycle. Simulations show a QT interval
reduction of 10 and 20 ms in the luteal phase compared to the
early and late follicular phases, respectively (Figure 4B — top
panel), which agree with the clinically observed QT shortening
(<10 ms shortening in the luteal phase compared to the follicular
phase) [27]. The models demonstrate that despite the presence of
E2 (0.7 nM) during the luteal phase, high progesterone (40.6 nM)
results in luteal phase shortening of APD and a QT interval (on

the pseudo-ECG) reduction of 4% (from early follicular phase) and
7.7% (from late follicular phase).
The experimental study from Liu et al. suggested the QT
intervals were significantly shorter (11.3%) in male than in female
rabbits [37]. In Figure 4A-iv and Figure 4A-v, our simulations show
the effects of testosterone on APD in simulated one-dimensional
tissue. The model predicts that testosterone-induced faster repolar￾ization and caused QT interval reduction to 230 ms (11.5%
shortening — case iv) and 220 ms (15.3% shortening — case v)
compared with the late follicular phase (260 ms) in Figure 4B. We
also ran these simulations in the presence of 10 nM and 35 nM
testosterone and 0.1 nM E2, which is estimated as the average
circulating concentration of E2 in men [28] (shown in Supplemental
Figure S3). In the presence of E2, QT intervals increase by 10 ms,
corresponding to 7.7% (10 nM) and 11.5% (35 nM) shortening
compared to the late follicular phase in females.
Effects of estrogen and testosterone on the sensitivity of
IKr to channel block by drugs
Experimental evidence suggests that in the presence of
physiological concentrations of E2, the potency of IKr block by
drugs is increased [25]. This finding may explain, in part, the
increased susceptibility of females to drug-induced arrhythmias
[8,9]. Hence, we next tested the effect of E2 on IKr suppression
induced by the IKr channel blocker E-4031 and investigated the
effects of female hormones on drug-induced arrhythmia suscep￾tibility. Experimental results [25] shown in Figure 5A (top)
illustrate that E2 (1 nM) considerably increased the suppression of
hERG by E-4031 (light gray line). However DHT did not greatly
change the drug-induced inhibition of hERG current (dark gray
line). We then obtained measured ratios of IKr conductance in the
presence of E-4031 and E2 or DHT from the experimental data
and used these values to simulate dose-dependence curves for IKr
suppression by E-4031 (control — black line) and after addition of
1 nM E2 (light gray line) and DHT 3 nM (dark gray line)
(Figure 5A — lower panel). In Figure 5B (top panel), we show a
simulation of a one-dimensional strand of coupled M cells (100
cells) in the late follicular phase during E-4031 treatment, where
the model predicts the most dramatic APD and QT interval
prolongation. At 10 nM E-4031, the simulated tissue-level APD is
shorter with testosterone application (250 ms — 3 nM) compared
with APD in the presence of female hormones (280 ms —
E2 = 1.0 nM, progesterone = 2.5 nM) as seen in Figure 5B. The
pseudo ECG (5B — lower traces) shows that QT interval is
substantially longer in the late follicular phase (case i) than with
testosterone treatment (case ii).
Effects of female hormones on pause-dependent LQT￾associated arrhythmias with E-4031
The exact mechanism of TdP induction is unclear, but it is
thought that pause-induced early afterdepolarizations (EADs) can
underlie TdP initiation [38,39]. Hence, we performed a series of
simulations to investigate pause-dependent LQT syndrome and its
association with arrhythmia susceptibility in the presence of male
and female hormones. Single M cells were paced for 10 beats of
BCL at 1000 ms (s1) followed by a premature beat (s2) with
varying s1–s2 intervals and then a long pause of varying duration
as indicated. Our simulations show no EADs (APD.450 ms)
occurred during the late follicular phase with no drug application
(Figure 6A — left panel) or with the application of E-4031 in the
presence of testosterone 3 nM (middle) during a short-long pacing

protocol. However in the absence of sex-steroid hormones, EADs
were generated by addition of 10 nM E-4031 when the pause
interval was very long (.2500 ms) (right panel).
In Figure 6B, we investigated the short-long pacing induced EAD
by E-4031 in the late follicular phase, where the concentration of E2
is highest, after pacing at three basic cycle length (500, 750 and
1000 ms). This pacing sequence triggered EADs over a wide range
of pauses in all three conditions. APDs of the s3 (post pause) beat are
notably lengthened with increasing basic cycle lengths from 500 ms
to 1000 ms (Figure 6B — left panel to right panel). Severe EADs
were induced at 1000 ms pacing length with a pause greater than
1500 ms (6B — right panel). The point in Figure 6B (right) indicates
an EAD that was triggered following a pause of 1500 ms and s1–s2
interval of 810 ms during baseline pacing length of 1000 ms. We
have carried out the simulations in a coupled one-dimensional M￾cell tissue (6B — lower panels) using the same protocol, and
observed propagation of the EAD in the tissue. These simulations
suggest that 3 nM testosterone is sufficient to prevent EAD
development in the presence of E-4031 10 nM. However, in
females, during the late follicular phase of the menstrual cycle, the
increased concentration of estrogen appears to exacerbate drug￾induced TdP arrhythmias.
APD prolongation triggers reentrant excitation in
heterogeneous tissues
Finally, to test the potential for E2-exacerbated EADs to
trigger reentrant arrhythmia activity in 2D heterogeneous tissue,
we carried out a series of simulations with varying combinations
of hormones and/or drug application. The simulated tissue was
stimulated along one edge, and a point stimulus was applied to
induce an ectopic beat during a short-long-short sequence
described in Supplemental Text S1. Figure 7 shows the results of
simulations in four cases at indicated time points. In the absence
of hormones or drugs, an initiated wave propagates in all
directions, and no reentry occurs (first row). The same behavior
is observed following drug application alone (E-4031) and with
testosterone application alone (DHT 10 nM). However, when
E2 (1 nM) is present (bottom row), the M-cell region is
preferentially prolonged (due to the effect of E2 on the
background of less repolarizing current that defines this region),
which prevents the wavefront from crossing the refractory M￾cell region. Instead, the wave propagates leftward at first - until
the M-cell region repolarizes, and allows the wave to first cross
the M-cell region and then slowly turn to the right. The slowly
traveling wavefront (Na+ channels are only partially recovered
following the prolonged action potential initiated by previous
stimulus) begins a cycle of reentry – turning around and
continuing to propagate on the wake of the preceding wave
(Figure 7 – bottom panel).
In Figure 8A (top), the simulations suggest no reentrant activity
during the late follicular phase of the menstrual cycle (progester￾one 2.5 nM and 1 nM E2). However, when 10 nM E-4031 is
applied during the late follicular phase, a spiral wave is readily
induced (Figure 8A – middle). We also tested the effects of male

hormone (testosterone) in the presence of E-4031. Figure 8A
(bottom) shows that testosterone 3nM with 10 nM E-4031 did not
trigger reentry activity.
Interestingly, the induction of a spiral wave in the presence of E￾4031 during the late follicular phase of the menstrual cycle is a
robust phenomenon. Reentry was introduced in this condition
when the ectopic stimulus was applied in the subendocardial or
subepicardial region – although not in the M-cell region (not
shown). The position of the stimulus is also not critical. Figure 8B
shows the effect of a point stimulus applied in the middle of

Discussion
Here, we demonstrate the acute effects of sex steroid hormones
in model cells and tissue, from physiological blood concentration
to channel interaction, to their effects on APD and tissue
dynamics. We used a computational approach to examine the
role for acute application of sex steroid hormones on susceptibility
to cardiac arrhythmias. The benefit of this approach is that it
allows us to investigate the consequences of hormones on cardiac
ion channels in isolation, so that observed changes can be
specifically attributed to them.
We simulated the acute effects of sex steroid hormones on
cardiac cell and tissue dynamics and on fluctuations of QT
interval. It has been shown that progesterone enhances IKs, which
counterbalances the IKr reduction by E2. Because estrogen and
progesterone dominate in the different phases of menstrual cycle,
simulations show that during the late follicular phase (prior to
ovulation) of the menstrual cycle, QT interval is longer than in the
luteal phase when progesterone is increased, which is consistent
with the clinical observation by Nakagawa et al [27]. Notably, the
fluctuations in QT interval during the menstrual cycle predicted
by our model are within a relatively narrow range of 20 ms, which
approximates the clinically assessed standard deviation in pooled
QT intervals for a patient population assessed at each phase of the
menstrual cycle [31]. One explanation is that such an analysis is
unlikely to be sensitive enough to observe significant individual
differences in QT intervals as they are fluctuating throughout the
menstrual cycle, since biological variability between patients may
be larger than fluctuations in individual patients.
Here we demonstrated that increasing testosterone reduced the
APD and QT interval in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 2 and
4) by enhancing IKs and inhibiting ICa,L current. Moreover,
differences in APD become more pronounced between E2
treatment and testosterone treatment when cycle length
$800 ms - shown in Supplemental Figure S5. Taken all together,
these results suggest that sex hormones influence cardiac
repolarization in a dose- and cycle length-dependent manner.
This is consistent with experimental studies of gender-related
differences on cycle length-dependent QT [2,37].
Since clinical findings suggest female gender is an independent
risk factor for TdP arrhythmias and previous experimental studies
have shown that E-4031 induced greater prolongation in E2-treated
than in DHT-treated animals [2,37,40], we investigated the
potential for E2 to exacerbate and testosterone to ameliorate
arrhythmias in the presence of IKr block. We used simulations to
probe these effects and ask if the presence of these two hormones at
physiological concentrations play a key role on gender differences in
drug-induced LQTS. We incorporated the experimentally mea￾sured combined effects of E2 and E-4031 on IKr and then simulated
them on cardiac tissue dynamics. Since drug-induced TdP is often
observed following a short-long-short pacing sequence in clinical
studies [38,41,42], we explored tissue dynamics using such a
protocol. Although we did not observe the development of
arrhythmogenic EADs during the late follicular phase of the
menstrual cycle (when E2 concentration is at its peak), addition of
the IKr blocker E-4031 resulted in EAD formation in the late
follicular phase for a wide range of pacing protocols (Figure 6).
The model simulations also suggested that E-4031 treatment in
late follicular phase could lead to initiation of spiral wave reentrant
arrhythmias (Figure 8). These simulations imply that at certain
phases of the menstrual cycle, elevated levels of E2 may put
females at risk for drug-induced arrhythmias – in particular by
agents that bind to the promiscuous drug target hERG.
Furthermore, we demonstrated that progesterone has a protective
effect against E2-induced LQT syndrome (Figure 7 and 8). Spiral
waves were not initiated in the presence of low concentrations of
progesterone (2.5 nM – late follicular phase). This suggests that
progesterone may play an important role in protecting against
arrhythmia in females. Unlike the apparent pro-arrhythmic effects
of E2 in the presence of Ikr block, testosterone was shown in our
simulations to prevent E-4031 induced EADs during a short-long￾short pacing protocol (Figure 6 and 8).
In the present study, our computational investigation demon￾strates the acute effects of progesterone, estradiol and testosterone
on cardiac ion channels that are critical for the rate of cardiac
repolarization and resultant QT intervals. The models successfully
simulates the effects of progesterone and testosterone on cardiac
IKs and ICa,L. These two hormones hasten repolarization, albeit to
different extents, and reduce QT interval and susceptibility to
LQT-linked arrhythmias. On the contrary, E2 increased QT
interval and propensity for TdP arrhythmias by reducing
repolarizing current via IKr.
There are several limitations to this study that must be noted.
First, we deliberately focused on the effects of acute application of
physiological concentrations of sex steroid hormones here, but this
means that we have neglected the effects of chronic hormone
application. Several studies have suggested that chronic exposure
to sex hormones may alter the response of the tissue to acute
application of sex hormones [35], alter expression of ICaL (in a
species dependent manner) [43–47] and may cause structural
remodeling of the myocardium [45]. We ran simulations
incorporating the measured differences by Verkerk [43] in human
ICaL between males and females (since the goal was not to examine
guinea pig sex differences). The results of these simulations are in
Supplemental Figure S6. As expected, the additional Ca2+ current
in the female prominently exacerbated the APD prolongation
associated with E2. These effects may even be expected to increase
in human females where primary repolarizing K+ currents,
especially IKs, are apparently less prominent than in guinea pig
[48]. However, progesterone effects on IKs in human may offset
some of the observed increase in ICaL in human females compared
to human males (described above). This issue should be addressed
in future studies when the human data are more complete. The
guinea pig model is also lacking transient outward K+ currents (Ito)
– a subset of channels that have not yet shown to be affected by
acute application of sex steroid hormones.
In summary, our study suggests that a computational approach
to investigating effects of physiologically circulating hormones can
be useful to test and predict their contribution to gender
differences in cardiac arrhythmia susceptibility. Moreover, the
findings from our model simulations suggest the potential utility of
progesterone as a therapeutic agent for inherited and acquired
forms of Long-QT Syndrome and that progestin-only contracep￾tives be given special consideration for their potential amelioration
of LQT risk among pre-menopausal women. Finally, the link
between estrogen containing hormone replacement therapy
among post-menopausal women and increased incidence of
adverse cardiac events needs to be investigated in the context of
acute hormone effects on ion channels.

Rudy cardiac cell model [49]. The IKr channel was replaced with
Markov model of wild type based on Clancy and Rudy so that E2
effects on activation gating could be readily incorporated.
Although the level of detail in terms of description of gating by
the IKr Markov model or the H-H IKr model is the same, the key
difference is that the Markov model takes into account the
property of coupling between discrete states, while H-H presumes
independence between gating processes. This difference is only
relevant in the setting of perturbation to one gating process –
precisely what is observed when E2 is present, where activation
gating is exhibits a small positive shift in voltage dependence [50].
All the simulation code was in C/C++ and run on Mac Pro
3.0 GHz 8-Core computers. The time step was set to 0.0005 ms

Figure S2 Simulated action potentials for the 50th paced beat at
a cycle length of 1000 ms in single epicardial and endocardial
cells. The APD for each concentration of sex-steroid hormone is
indicated. Epi indicates epicardial; and Endo, endocardial. In
epicardial cells, a low concentration of E2 (0.1 nM) has slight
effects on APD compared with control case (from 165.73 to
165.22 ms). However, a higher concentration of E2 (1.0 nM)
prolonged APD (168.89 ms) (Figure S2A – left panel). For
endocardial cells, APD is lengthened by 1 nM E2 from
184.22 ms (0 nM E2) to 189.54 ms. APD is slightly increased to
184.95 ms in the presence of 0.1 nM E2. Figure S2B shows that
progesterone reduced APD at 2.5 nM to 157.64 ms in epicardial
and 175.79 ms in endocardial cell. At 40.6 nM, progesterone
obviously decreases APD to 150.84 ms in epicardial and
168.27 ms in endocardial cell. As see in Figure S2C, the
simulations predict longer APD in the late follicular phase
(160.79 ms – epi; 180.3 ms – endo) than in the early follicular
(158.08 ms – epi; 176.42 ms – endo), and show the shortest APD
in the luteal phase (152.82 ms – epi; 171.05 ms – endo). In Figure
S2D, we simulated changes in APD at 10 nM and 35 nM of
testosterone in epicardial and endocardial cells. The simulations
predict marked APD shortening to 149.5 ms (epicardial) and
166.33 ms (endocardial) at 10 nM. At 35 nM testosterone, APDs
are reduced to 144.08 ms (epi) and 159.32 ms (endo).

Figure S5 Action potential durations at 90% repolarization
(APD90) are calculated from 100th paced beat at various cycle
lengths (between 150 ms and 2000 ms). Sex-steroid hormones alter
the action potentials adaptation curves in a concentration￾dependent manner. We have demonstrated effects of sex-steroid
hormones on APD in cells and tissues, here we calculated action
potential duration at 90% repolarization (APD90) from the 100th
paced beat at various cycle lengths (between 150 ms and 2000 ms)
in order to study gender effects on ventricular reploarization rate.
Figure S5 illustrates action potentials adaptation curves for E2,
progesterone and the menstrual cycle as well as for two
concentrations of testosterone. High concentration of E2 (1 nM)
visibly increased APD at cycle lengths longer than 800 ms. In
contrast, APD is similar in the control condition (0 nM E2) and a
low concentration (0.1 nM) of E2 (Figure S5A). The adaptation
curves confirm that predicted effects of E2 on APD90 are larger at
longer cycle lengths. On the other hand, 40.6 nM progesterone
obviously reduced APD at pacing rates longer than 400 ms (Figure
S5B). APD90 was also predicted to have variable cycle length
dependence during different phases of the menstrual cycle. At a slow
rate APD90 was manifestly longer in the late follicular phase during
menstrual cycle than in luteal and early follicular phases as shown in
Figure S5C. Figure S5D suggests that testosterone at 10 nM
induced marked reduction in APD90 at cycle lengths .400 ms. At
35 nM testosterone, APD90 was additionally shortened.

Figure S6 Figure S6 shows the results of simulations in a 1D cable
during the menstrual cycles at combined female hormone
concentrations (as described through the paper) and incorporation
of a 29% increase in ICa,L in the female case as reported by
Verkerk et al., 2005 [43]. Simulations show that during the late
follicular phase, EADs were generated on alternate beats while APD
shortening occurred in the luteal phase (Figure S6, 50th and 51th
beats are shown). Notably, EADs disappeared after 60 beats (not
shown), but marked prolongation of APD and QT interval was
observed with continued pacing (for 200 beats) in the late follicular
phases (B) compared to the early follicular phase (A) and luteal phase
(C). The models demonstrate that despite the presence of E2
(0.7 nM) during the luteal phase, high progesterone (40.6 nM)
resulted in luteal phase shortening of APD and QT interval.
