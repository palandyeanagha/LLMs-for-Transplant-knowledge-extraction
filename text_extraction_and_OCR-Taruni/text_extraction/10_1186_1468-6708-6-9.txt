Abstract
Background: Patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) are at high risk of cardiovascular
events. Multiple risk factors for atherosclerosis are present in ESRD and may contribute to the
increased risk of cardiovascular mortality in this population. In contrast to patients with normal
renal function, the benefits of modifying lipid levels on cardiovascular outcomes in patients with
ESRD on haemodialysis have yet to be confirmed in large prospective randomised trials. A study
to evaluate the Use of Rosuvastatin in subjects On Regular haemodialysis: an Assessment of survival
and cardiovascular events (AURORA) will be the first large-scale international trial to assess the
effects of statin therapy on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in ESRD patients on chronic
haemodialysis.
Methods: More than 2,750 ESRD patients who have been receiving chronic haemodialysis
treatment for at least 3 months have been randomised (1:1), irrespective of baseline lipid levels, to
treatment with rosuvastatin 10 mg or placebo. The primary study endpoint is the time to a major
cardiovascular event (first occurrence of cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction or
non-fatal stroke). Secondary endpoints include all-cause mortality, major cardiovascular event-free
survival time, time to cardiovascular death, time to non-cardiovascular death, cardiovascular
interventions, tolerability of treatment and health economic costs per life-year saved. Study
medication will be given until 620 subjects have experienced a major cardiovascular event.
Conclusion: Our hypothesis is that results from AURORA will establish the clinical efficacy and
tolerability of rosuvastatin in patients with ESRD receiving chronic haemodialysis and guide the
optimal management of this expanding population.

Background
Patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) undergoing
haemodialysis have substantially higher cardiovascular
disease mortality rates than the general population [1-5].
Accelerated atherosclerosis has been observed in haemo￾dialysis patients [6] and may contribute to this increased
cardiovascular event rate. Treatment of ESRD and its car￾diovascular consequences places a large burden upon
healthcare providers, and the cost and prevalence are
expected to increase greatly over the next decade [5].
Therefore, controlling risk factors for atherosclerosis may
play an important role in preventing cardiovascular events
in these individuals.
Hydroxy-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reduct￾ase inhibitors (statins) have been demonstrated to reduce
coronary heart disease morbidity and mortality in several
landmark trials [7-14]. The reductions in cardiovascular
events also occur in patients with average to lower than
average baseline low-density lipoprotein cholesterol
(LDL-C) levels [12,14] and the benefits of statin therapy
can be independent of lipid lowering [15]. Most haemo￾dialysis patients do not have elevated cholesterol (total
and LDL-C) [16,17], and the highest mortality risk is often
in patients with very low cholesterol levels [18]. Other
chronic diseases and malnutrition may act to lower blood
cholesterol and independently increase the risk of death,
thereby contributing to the negative association between
very low cholesterol and mortality observed in these
patients [19,20]. Indeed, a recent prospective study sug￾gests that levels of total cholesterol (TC) may be associ￾ated with mortality in haemodialysis patients without
evidence of inflammation and malnutrition [20]. Haemo￾dialysis patients have other lipid abnormalities such as
lower levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL￾C) and elevated intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL)
and triglycerides [16,17].
Although the efficacy of statins is well established in con￾ditions associated with increased cardiovascular risk, dial￾ysis patients have generally been excluded from statin
outcome trials because of their related co-morbidities and
as a result of pharmacokinetic and safety issues. It is not
appropriate to extrapolate evidence from patients with
normal renal function to patients with ESRD on haemodi￾alysis, and there is a need to investigate the benefit-risk
profile of statins specifically in this population. Data from
an observational study indicate that statin treatment may
improve survival in patients with ESRD [21]. Mortality
was 32% lower in patients with ESRD who received statin
treatment compared with patients not receiving statins, a
finding that is consistent with other large outcome statin
trials [7,8,11]. However, observational studies do not
establish a causal relationship and large-scale randomised
studies are required [22]. The Die Deutsche Diabetes Dia￾lyse Studie (4D study) investigated the effect of atorvasta￾tin 20 mg or placebo on cardiovascular mortality, non￾fatal myocardial infarction and stroke in 1,255 patients
with type 2 diabetes who were on haemodialysis treat￾ment for no more than 2 years [23]. Initial results pre￾sented at the annual meeting of the American Society of
Nephrology indicate that the primary endpoint was
reduced by 8% after 4 years' treatment with atorvastatin,
but this was not significantly different from placebo [24].
Further large-scale long-term prospective, randomised
studies are required to investigate the efficacy and safety of
statins for reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortal￾ity, specifically in ESRD patients on haemodialysis [22].
Rosuvastatin is the most efficacious of the available statins
for lowering LDL-C levels, causing reductions of 47% at
the initial starting dose of 10 mg [25]. In addition, rosuv￾astatin has benefits across the lipid profile, including
increases in HDL-C, reductions in small dense LDL and
triglyceride-rich lipoprotein particles [25,26], and has a
safety profile consistent with other available statins [27].
These properties make it an ideal agent for a study inves￾tigating the benefits of statin treatment for the prevention
of cardiovascular events in a population of patients at
high risk of cardiovascular events. AURORA (A study to
evaluate the Use of Rosuvastatin in subjects On Regular
haemodialysis: an Assessment of survival and cardiovas￾cular events) is the first large-scale international trial to
assess the effects of a statin on cardiovascular morbidity
and mortality in ESRD patients on chronic haemodialysis
irrespective of baseline lipid levels.
Methods
Study design
AURORA is a double-blind, randomised, multicentre,
phase IIIb, parallel-group study comparing the effects of
rosuvastatin (10 mg once daily) with placebo on survival
and cardiovascular events in ESRD patients on chronic
haemodialysis.
More than 2,750 subjects from approximately 300 centres
in Europe, Canada, Australia, Brazil, Mexico and South
Korea have been randomised, irrespective of baseline
lipid levels. During the recruitment period, patients were
screened over 2 weeks for eligibility according to the
major inclusion and exclusion criteria (Table 1). Demo￾graphic data were collected on age, gender, race, medical
history, physical examination (including height, weight,
blood pressure and heart rate), smoking status, and
method and duration of dialysis (Table 2). Patients were
then randomised (1:1) into the two blinded treatment
arms of the study, rosuvastatin 10 mg/day or placebo, and
visits to assess safety and efficacy are scheduled to occur at
3 months, 6 months and every 6 months thereafter until
the end of the study (Figure 1; Table 2).

Objectives and endpoints
The primary objective of the AURORA study is to compare
the effects of rosuvastatin with placebo on cardiovascular
events. The primary endpoint is the time to a major cardi￾ovascular event (cardiovascular death, fatal myocardial
infarction or non-fatal stroke). An independent and
blinded Clinical Endpoint Committee (see Appendix)
will review all deaths, strokes and myocardial infarctions

using a predefined set of event definitions to ensure con￾sistency of event diagnosis across all subjects throughout
the study.
Secondary endpoints include all-cause mortality, cardio￾vascular event-free survival, cardiovascular death, non￾cardiovascular death, procedures as a result of stenosis or
thrombosis of the vascular access for chronic haemodial￾ysis (arteriovenous fistulas and grafts only), and coronary
or peripheral revascularisations. Furthermore, the tolera￾bility of rosuvastatin in ESRD patients undergoing regular
chronic haemodialysis will be compared with placebo.
The health economic impact of rosuvastatin treatment on
the utilisation of resources and costs associated with the
occurrence of a major cardiovascular event will also be
assessed. Costs related to hospitalisations will be com￾bined with survival analyses to enable the calculation of
cost per life-year saved.
Tertiary objectives include assessing the efficacy of treat￾ment at 3 and 12 months post-randomisation on high￾sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and various fasting
lipid parameters: TC, LDL-C, HDL-C, non-HDL-C, TC/
HDL-C, LDL-C/HDL-C, triglycerides, apolipoprotein B
(Apo B), apolipoprotein AI (Apo AI), Apo B/Apo AI ratio,
and oxidised LDL. Additionally, changes in TC, LDL-C,
HDL-C, non-HDL-C, TC/HDL-C, LDL-C/HDL-C and trig￾lycerides will be assessed after 24 months, 36 months
(then yearly as required) and at the final visit. A central
laboratory service (Quintiles Laboratories, Livingston,
UK) certified for standardisation of lipid analyses by the
Standardization Program of the Center for Disease Con￾trol and Prevention and the National Heart, Lung and
Blood Institute will perform all laboratory testing of lipids
and hsCRP. Additional laboratory work will be performed
in subgroup studies analysing the predictive power of var￾ious other markers of cardiovascular risk.
Genetic research may also be performed on certain sub￾jects at some study sites on an optional basis. DNA sam￾ples will be obtained for future research into the effects of
genetic polymorphisms on the response to rosuvastatin
and placebo. Susceptibility to, and prognosis of, cardio￾vascular disease and lipid disorders will also be studied.
Study population
Eligibility and treatment withdrawal
Irrespective of baseline lipid levels, patients aged 50–80
years with ESRD who have been receiving chronic haemo￾dialysis for at least 3 months were considered for inclu￾sion in the study unless they fulfilled any of the exclusion
criteria (key criteria detailed in Table 1). In addition,
patients who undergo kidney transplant surgery will be
withdrawn from study medication, but will continue to
follow scheduled study assessments. Treatment will also
be discontinued if patients have creatine kinase >10 times
upper limit of normal (ULN) accompanied by unex￾plained muscle pain or if myopathy is suspected or if the
patient becomes pregnant. Other reasons that may lead to
treatment discontinuation include: an adverse event or
endpoint that in the opinion of the investigator warrants
treatment withdrawal; alanine transaminase increase >3
times ULN on two occasions; other safety reasons as
judged by the investigator; protocol non-compliance.
Ethics
The study protocol and patient consent form have been
approved by an Independent Ethics Committee or Institu￾tional Review Board, as appropriate. The study is being
performed in accordance with the ethical principles that
have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki and are
consistent with International Conference on Harmonisa￾tion/Good Clinical Practice. The investigator from each
centre will ensure that subjects are given full and adequate
oral and written information about the nature, purpose,
risks and benefits of the study and that written consent is
obtained. The conduct and progress of the study is
reviewed by the Steering Committee and Executive Steer￾ing Committee (see Appendix). In addition, an independ￾ent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) (see
Appendix) is responsible for monitoring all safety aspects
of the study. The DSMB will review and evaluate all seri￾ous adverse events and endpoints at least every 6 months
using unblinded data and will then report to the Executive
Steering Committee in a blinded manner. The DSMB will
also be responsible for making recommendations to the
Executive Steering Committee regarding modifying or
stopping the study early.
Data analysis
The efficacy endpoints will be analysed using the intent￾to-treat population, including all randomised subjects.
For the time-to-event endpoints, Kaplan-Meier curves will
be used to show the proportion of subjects without an
endpoint. An unadjusted Cox Proportional Hazards
model with treatment as the covariate will be used to ana￾lyse the endpoint. An additional Cox Proportional Haz￾ards regression model [28] will also be constructed
adjusting for known and potential risk factors as a second￾ary analysis and to test for interactions between risk fac￾tors and treatment. The number of coronary or peripheral
revascularisations will also be summarised, but not for￾mally analysed. For the tertiary endpoints, the percentage
change from baseline for each parameter will be assessed
for each time point by an analysis of covariance, with the
baseline value as a covariate. An exploratory analysis will
also be conducted to examine whether lipid values at 3,
12, 24, 36 months (yearly if required) and at the final visit
are predictive of future cardiovascular events.

The sample size was determined such that the study will
be adequately powered for the analysis of the primary
endpoint, time from randomisation to a major cardiovas￾cular event. Based on previous studies, it is anticipated
that the cardiovascular event rate in the placebo group
will be 11% per year. The sample size has been calculated
in order to be able to detect a 25% reduction in cardiovas￾cular events rate per year at a two-sided significance level
of 4.86%, with 90% power. The study will continue until
620 subjects have experienced a major cardiovascular
event. This is expected to be approximately 3.9 years after
initiation of the study, which began in January 2003. An
interim efficacy analysis will be conducted by the DSMB
when 310 subjects have experienced a major cardiovascu￾lar event. The purpose of the interim analysis is to investi￾gate, at this time, the possibility of concluding a
statistically significant difference between the treatments
for time from randomisation to major cardiovascular
event.
Discussion
Patients with ESRD have an increased risk of cardiovascu￾lar morbidity and mortality [2,4], and this contributes to
the large burden this disease places upon healthcare pro￾viders [5]. A number of studies have indicated that
patients on dialysis with very low TC levels have a higher
rate of mortality [18,20]. Both small dense LDL and trig￾lyceride-rich lipoproteins have been implicated in the
development of cardiovascular disease [29-32] and are
common in patients with ESRD and on haemodialysis
[16,33-37]. Triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, in particular
IDL, are prevalent and predictive of atherosclerosis in
haemodialysis patients [17]. Thus, modifying lipid levels
with a statin should have beneficial effects on
cardiovascular outcomes in these patients. Large outcome
studies also indicate that the positive effects of statins
occur irrespective of baseline lipid levels [12,14]. While
the efficacy of statins for altering the lipid profile has been
studied previously in ESRD patients [38-42], their long￾term benefits on cardiovascular outcomes in this popula￾tion have not yet been examined and dialysis patients
have generally been excluded from statin outcome trials.
Several studies examining outcome after statin treatment
have recently been completed or are in progress in
patients with related conditions. In a study in renal trans￾plant patients, fluvastatin reduced the risk of cardiac death
or non-fatal myocardial infarction by 35% compared with
subjects receiving placebo (risk ratio 0.65 [95% confi￾dence intervals 0.48–0.88]; p = 0.005) [43]. Initial find￾ings of the 4D study did not demonstrate a significant
difference between atorvastatin 20 mg and placebo treat￾ment; however, LDL-C levels were reduced during the
study period [24]. Another study is ongoing; the Study of
Heart And Renal Protection (SHARP) aims to assess the
effects of simvastatin and the cholesterol-absorption
inhibitor ezetimibe among patients with chronic kidney
disease [18]. AURORA is the first international, prospec￾tive, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study
to assess whether statin therapy alone can reduce the inci￾dence of coronary events in ESRD patients on chronic
haemodialysis.
Most haemodialysis patients do not have elevated LDL-C
and, in accordance with findings from the Heart Protec￾tion Study, the AURORA trial will randomise patients irre￾spective of their baseline lipid levels [12]. Patients on
haemodialysis have lower levels of HDL-C and higher
triglycerides compared with control subjects [16]. Accord￾ingly, a statin with efficacy across the lipid profile would
be appropriate to assess the benefits of treatment in ESRD
patients. Rosuvastatin is the most efficacious statin
reported for lowering LDL-C [44], and has benefits across
the lipid profile. In a study of hypercholesterolaemic
patients, rosuvastatin has been shown to increase HDL-C
by 7.7–9.6% compared with 4.4–5.7% for atorvastatin
and 5.2–6.0% for simvastatin across the 10–40 mg dose
range [44]. In addition, rosuvastatin has been shown to
substantially lower triglyceride-rich lipoproteins in both
hypercholesterolaemic and hypertriglyceridaemic
patients [45]. The effects of haemodialysis upon excretion
of statins should also be considered. On the basis of phar￾macokinetic, pharmacodynamic and safety data obtained
from a pilot study, rosuvastatin 10 mg can be safely
administered to patients with ESRD on chronic haemodi￾alysis (data on file, AstraZeneca).
In addition to their ability to modify lipid levels, statins
produce other effects that may benefit ESRD patients. Oxi￾dative stress has been implicated in the pathogenesis of
cardiovascular disease, and it is enhanced in patients with
renal insufficiency [46,47]. Recently, statins have been
reported to have anti-oxidant effects [48], which may be
of benefit to these patients. Statins may also have addi￾tional non-lipid or pleiotropic effects, for example,
improving endothelial function [15]. Endothelial dys￾function has been implicated in the development of car￾diovascular disease and has been shown to be closely
associated with the degree of renal insufficiency [49]. Pre￾clinical experiments have shown that rosuvastatin can
improve endothelial function [50], although this has yet
to be verified in a clinical situation. Finally, left ventricular
hypertrophy and heart failure can also develop in ESRD
patients on haemodialysis [51]. Statin therapy has been
reported to reduce left ventricular hypertrophy [52] and
retrospective analyses indicate that these agents can also
help to prevent heart failure [53]. These properties could
provide an additional beneficial effect in ESRD patients.

The AURORA study should provide valuable information
on the utility of statin treatment for the reduction of car￾diovascular events in patients with ESRD. As an athero￾genic lipid profile and endothelial dysfunction are often
present in individuals with ESRD and contribute to the
development of atherosclerosis, it is anticipated that rosu￾vastatin will improve cardiovascular outcomes in this
patient population. Furthermore, it is hoped that
AURORA will produce data on the cost effectiveness (cost
due to hospitalisation and cost per year of life saved) and
long-term safety of rosuvastatin treatment in ESRD
patients receiving chronic haemodialysis. This study will
also generate a large database of information from a well￾documented cohort, which may be valuable in the epide￾miological evaluation of cardiovascular risk in patients
with ESRD.
