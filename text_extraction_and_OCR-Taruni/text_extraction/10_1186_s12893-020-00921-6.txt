Abstract
Background: Idiopathic portal hypertension (IPH) generally has a good prognosis and rarely results in liver transplan￾tation. Furthermore, there are few reports of living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) for IPH with extrahepatic portal 
vein stenosis.
Case presentation: We report the case of a 51-year-old female patient diagnosed with IPH more than 20 years ago. 
She suffered severe jaundice, massive ascites, and encephalopathy at the time of her visit to our hospital. The patient’s 
extrahepatic portal vein showed a scar-like stenosis, and the portal flow was completely hepatofugal. Collateral 
circulation such as the splenorenal shunt was well developed, and multiple splenic artery aneurysms up to 2 cm were 
observed in the splenic hilum. Her Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score increased to over 40 because of renal dys￾function, requiring temporary dialysis. We performed LDLT using her husband’s right lobe graft and splenectomy. The 
extrahepatic stenotic portal vein was completely resected, and the superficial femoral vein (SFV) graft collected from 
the recipient’s right leg was used for portal reconstruction as an interposition graft. Although the clinical course after 
LDLT had many complications, the patient was discharged on postoperative day 113 and has been fine for 2 years 
after LDLT. Histopathologically, the explanted liver had obliterative portal venopathy, nodular regenerative hyperpla￾sia, and incomplete septal cirrhosis.
Conclusion: This case showed that severe IPH is occasionally associated with extrahepatic portal vein stenosis and 
can be treated with LDLT with portal vein reconstruction using an interposition graft. It was also suggested that the 
SFV is a useful choice for the interposition graft.

Background
Idiopathic portal hypertension (IPH) comprises disorders 
that develop increased portal pressure in the absence of 
cirrhosis [1]. The etiology of IPH is pooly understood as 
the site of resistance to portal flow is at the presinusoidal 
level without cirrhosis [2]. Many terms have been used

for this disease such as non-cirrhotic portal fibrosis, nod￾ular regenerative hyperplasia (NRH), hepatoportal scle￾rosis, and idiopathic noncirrhotic portal hypertension; 
IPH has been the most commonly used term in Japan.
Although most IPH patients have a good prognosis 
with the treatment for esophageal varices and/or other 
complications due to portal hypertension, some develop 
end-stage liver failure and need for liver transplantation 
[3–5]. It has been reported that about 6% of patients with 
IPH required liver transplantation [6]. In Japan, there 
were 8795 living liver transplants until 2017, of which 
10 were for IPH patients, including 9 adults and 1 child 
[7]. Living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) for IPH 
accounts for about 0.1% of the total, which is an indica￾tion of its rarity.
Since IPH is considered to have portal hypertension at 
the presinusoidal level, there are few reports of LDLT for 
IPH with extrahepatic portal vein stenosis. Although it is 
unclear when and how the extrahepatic portal vein steno￾sis was completed in IPH, this situation required compli￾cated portal vein reconstruction with interposition vein 
graft, jumping vein graft [8], or renoportal anastomosis 
[9] using autologous vein graft.
The superficial femoral vein (SFV) seems to be the 
preferred option for vein grafts because of its caliber, 
wall thickness, and length obtained. An approximately 
15–20 cm segment of the right-side SFV could be usually 
obtained from the recipient. The collection procedure 
is technically simple, and postoperative complications 
such as lower extremity temporary edema are usually not 
severe, with no permanent complications [10].
Splenic artery aneurysms (SAAs), occurring in 7% to 
17% of patients with cirrhosis, often result in catastrophic 
rupture after liver transplantation [11]. SAAs are closely 
related to severe portal hypertension with large portosys￾temic collaterals. While visceral aneurysms larger than 
2  cm are more likely to rupture, preventive treatment 
should be encouraged regardless of the size of SAAs, 
because the risk of rupture increases during the periop￾erative period of liver transplantation, in which hemody￾namic and proteolytic changes occur [11, 12]. Whether 
to select interventional radiology (IVR) or surgical treat￾ment such as splenectomy as a treatment method needs 
to be individually selected according to the patient’s gen￾eral condition, and the location and number of SAAs.
We report a very rare case of end-stage IPH with 
extrahepatic portal vein stenosis and SAAs close to the 
hilum of the spleen. As the patient was so sick that she 
had to temporarily undergo dialysis, she could not get 
any preventive treatment against the SAAs before liver 
transplantation. We decided to perform LDLT and sple￾nectomy with a complicated portal vein reconstruction 
using the SFV graft.
Case presentation
A 51-year-old female patient was admitted to explore the 
possibility of liver transplantation for liver failure due 
to IPH. She had NRH on liver biopsy 20  years ago and 
was diagnosed with IPH. The patient’s extrahepatic por￾tal vein showed a scar-like stenosis, and the portal flow 
was completely hepatofugal. Collateral circulation such 
as the splenorenal shunt was well developed, and dense 
calcification was observed at the site of splenomesen￾teric junction (Fig.  1), suggesting that the usual portal 
reconstruction would be impossible. Furthermore, mul￾tiple splenic artery aneurysms (SAAs) up to 2  cm were 
observed in the splenic hilum (Fig. 2). The patient’s condi￾tion was getting worse and her Child–Pugh score became 
13, and her Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) 
score increased to over 40 because of renal dysfunction, 
requiring temporary dialysis. Due to the high risk of rup￾ture during the perioperative period of liver transplanta￾tion, it was considered necessary to take some preventive 
measures against the SAAs; however, it was difficult to 
perform preoperatively due to her medical condition. 
Therefore, splenectomy at the time of transplantation 
was needed. Since the splenorenal shunt was likely to be 
destroyed during splenectomy, portal vein reconstruc￾tion using renoportal anastomosis was considered to 
not be possible. For the jumping vein graft, long-term 
patency was a concern because it passed through a non￾physiological route. We decided to use an interposition

autologous graft between the splenomesenteric junction 
and the graft portal vein stump.
LDLT using her husband’s right lobe graft was per￾formed. The graft recipient weight ratio (GRWR) of the 
graft was 1.26, which was rated as a sufficient large for 
the recipient. After total hepatectomy, the recipient’s 
right side SFV graft was harvested. The portal vein was 
dissected to the side of the pancreas, and the dorsal side 
of the pancreas was tunneled to confirm the splenic vein 
(SPV) and superior mesenteric vein (SMV). After clamp￾ing the SMV and SPV, the stenotic portal vein was com￾pletely resected, and the dense calcification of vascular 
endothelium was removed at the splenomesenteric junc￾tion. The SFV graft was anastomosed to the splenomes￾enteric junction in an end-to-side fashion. After right 
hepatic vein reconstruction and confirming the sufficient 
front flow of the portal vein, an end-to-end anastomosis 
was performed on the portal vein of the graft liver and 
the SFV graft (Fig. 3).
The clinical course after transplantation had many 
complications. An intraabdominal abscess due to grade B 
pancreatic fistula classified by international study group 
of pancreatic fistula (ISGPF) [13] after splenectomy for 
splenic artery aneurysm occurred on postoperative day 
(POD) 14. It was gradually relieved by percutaneous CT 
guide drainage. Late onset bile leakage occurred on POD 
32, which was managed by drainage and biliary stent. A 
large amount of ascites appeared and the anastomotic 
stenosis between the SFV graft and the splenomesenteric 
junction was found on POD 52. A small laparotomy was 
performed to secure the ileocolic vein, and balloon dila￾tation (diameter of 8  mm) of anastomotic stenosis was 
achieved by interventional radiology technique via the 
ileocolic venous approach. The pressure difference before 
and after the anastomosis site was 15 mmHg before bal￾loon dilatation, and 3 mmHg after the treatment. Massive 
ascites had been gradually improved and the patient was 
discharged on POD 113. The explant liver histologically 
showed obstructive portal venopathy, NRH, and incom￾plete septal cirrhosis, which was typical of IPH (Fig. 4).
The clinical course after discharge was uneventful and 
the SFV graft patency was excellent at 2 years after LDLT 
(Fig. 5).
Discussion and conclusion
IPH is a rare disease characterized by portal hyperten￾sion without cirrhosis. The prognosis of IPH is consid￾ered as feasible with management for esophageal varices 
and/or splenomegaly by supportive treatments such as 
endoscopic, radiological, and surgical approach. The defi￾nite etiology of IPH is still uncertain, however, there are 
several theories that have been attributed to the poten￾tial pathogenesis of IPH. The contributing factors include 
immunological disorders, infections, and genetic varia￾tions [1].
IPH rarely results in neither end-stage liver failure 
nor requiring liver transplantation. Past case reports 
for severe IPH requiring liver transplantation were 
summarized in Table 1 [3, 5, 9, 14–20]. To date, about 
50 cases of liver transplantation have been reported 
for IPH. Approximately 80% of the reported cases 
were male, and few patients had been diagnosed with 
IPH preoperatively. Most of cases were cadaveric liver 
transplantation cases for cryptogenic cirrhosis, and 
reports of LDLT cases were even rarer, and were lim￾ited to reports from India and Japan. Out of 8795 
LDLT in Japan up to 2017, only 10 (0.1%) cases for 
IPH. The same pathological condition as IPH is called

for Non-cirrhotic portal fibrosis (NCPF) in India. Sai￾gal et al. reported that 10 (2.5%) out of 406 LDLT cases 
were pathologically diagnosed as pure NCPF from the 
study of explant livers in India. This rate was extremely 
high as compared to that in Japan, however, whether or 
not the IPH in Japan was the same condition as NCPF 
in India may need further verification.
When the disease duration of IPH had been long, the 
extrahepatic portal vein itself may occasionally become 
atrophic and scar-like because of the hepatofugal por￾tal flow and/or unknown reasons. These situations may 
result in stenosis of the extrahepatic portal vein. To date, 
there is only one case report of liver transplantation for 
IPH with extrahepatic portal vein stenosis. In that case, 
a right lobe LDLT with renoportal anastomosis was per￾formed using the recipient’s internal jugular vein graft for 
portal reconstruction [9]. However, in our case, splenec￾tomy for splenic artery aneurysms might destroy a part 
of the splenorenal shunt, suggesting that renoportal anas￾tomosis might be impossible. Alternatively, portal vein 
reconstruction with interposition vein graft between the 
splenomesenteric junction and donor portal vein stump 
was performed using a recipient’s superficial femoral vein 
(SFV).
The SFV graft obtained from the recipient is not only 
an autologous vein graft with no immune reaction, but 
also a very long vein graft with a sufficient diameter. A 
15–20  cm length graft can be usually obtained, so the 
SFV graft alone can cover all the vein graft reconstruc￾tion in LDLT [8, 21]. The procurement procedure is sim￾ple, but the length of the skin incision may be longer than 
that of other vein grafts. Since SFV grafts have valves in 
their lumens, we have dissected all these valves under 
the direct vision. It is well known that harvesting the 
SFV peripherally to the profound femoral vein inflow is 
well tolerated and associated with only minimal lower 
extremity venous morbidity [10]. The lower extremity 
suffered edema, but it improved within about 1  month, 
and did not pose long-term problem.
In our case, anastomotic stenosis between the sple￾nomesenteric junction and SFV graft occurred on POD 
52, resulting in increasing ascites. Conservative treat￾ments such as the use of diuretics did not succeed; the 
re-operation and balloon dilatation of the anastomotic

stenosis were performed using the interventional radiol￾ogy technique via the ileocolic vein. Possible reasons of 
anastomotic stenosis might include technical errors, and/
or a twisting associated with the graft regeneration, but 
it is not clear. Despite the reason being unclear, a single 
attempt of balloon dilatation had completely solved the 
problem, therefore, we determined that this complication 
should not raise doubts about the usefulness of the SFV 
graft in portal reconstruction.
The diagnosis of IPH is extremely difficult because the 
liver is usually atrophic and closely resembles cirrhosis 
in both clinical symptoms and diagnositic imaging in the 
late stage of IPH. Therefore, only histological findings 
obtained by liver biopsy will lead to the precise diagno￾sis of IPH preoperatively. Histopathologically, almost all 
patients with IPH have some degree of obliterative portal 
venopaty, furthermore, NRH and incomplete septal cir￾rhosis are also characteristic findings of IPH. Our patient 
had an NRH on liver biopsy and was diagnosed with 
IPH 20  years before the first visit to our hospital. The 
patient’s explanted liver showed evidence of obliterative 
portal venopathy, NRH, and incomplete septal cirrhosis, 
which were compatible with IPH, but not with end-stage 
cirrhosis.

In conclusion, we reported a very rare case of end-stage 
IPH with extrahepatic portal vein stenosis and the SAAs 
close to the hilum of the spleen. This case showed that 
severe IPH is occasionally associated with extrahepatic 
portal vein stenosis and can be treated with LDLT with 
portal vein reconstruction using an interposition graft. It 
was also suggested that the SFV is a useful choice for the 
interposition graft.
