INTRODUCTION AND PRELIMINARY OB￾SERVATIONS 
An inevitable consequence of human and rodent aging 
is sarcopenia--loss of muscle mass [1]. Some muscle 
loss is due to physical inactivity, but even highly trained 
athletes lose muscle mass and strength with age [2-6]. 
Although exercise programs can prevent and/or 
ameliorate sarcopenia, the effectiveness of exercise 
interventions to build muscle and effect metabolic 
improvements is less efficient in elderly subjects than in 
the young, due to multiple cellular and biochemical 
changes [7, 8]. Frailty is a clinically-defined condition 
that includes sarcopenia and some of its consequences 
and is a powerful predictor of mortality [9, 10]. Adipose 
tissue gain also is very common in aging and is a 
growing health concern for all ages [11, 12]. Visceral 
(abdominal) fat is of the greatest health concern because 
 Review 
it is associated with insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, 
cardiovascular disease, dementia, cancer, and overall 
mortality [3, 13]. Although obesity can be associated 
with normal, increased, or decreased muscle mass, 
muscle weight and even muscle fiber size 
measurements can be misleading in aging because 
muscle becomes infiltrated with fat [5, 14]. 
Furthermore, obesity prevents muscle gain in response 
to functional overload, possibly through skeletal muscle 
mTOR hyperactivation [15, 16]. Importantly, the 
combination of obesity and sarcopenia (so-called 
sarcopenic obesity) carries high health risks [5]. 
Another hallmark of aging is declining adaptive 
immunity, with complex alterations in innate immunity 
[17-19]. Immune senescence is associated with 
mortality from all causes, including infectious diseases 
[17, 20]. Natural killer (NK) lymphocytes are innate

Abstract: Human aging is characterized by both physical and physiological frailty. A key feature of frailty, sarcopenia is the
age‐associated decline in skeletal muscle mass, strength, and endurance that characterize even the healthy elderly. Increases
in adiposity, particularly in visceral adipose tissue, are almost universal in aging individuals and can contribute to sarcopenia
and insulin resistance by increasing levels of inflammatory cytokines known collectively as adipokines. Aging also is associated
with declines in adaptive and innate immunity, known as immune senescence, which are risk factors for cancer and all‐cause
mortality. The cytokine interleukin‐15 (IL‐15) is highly expressed in skeletal muscle tissue and declines in aging rodent models.
IL‐15 inhibits fat deposition and insulin resistance, is anabolic for skeletal muscle in certain situations, and is required for the
development and survival of natural killer (NK) lymphocytes. We review the effect that adipokines and myokines have on NK
cells, with special emphasis on IL‐15. We posit that increased adipokine and decreased IL‐15 levels during aging constitute a
common mechanism for sarcopenia, obesity, and immune senescence.

immune cells that control intracellular infectious agents 
and cancers. In contrast to T and B lymphocytes, NK 
cell number is relatively increased in healthy aging and 
defects in NK cell function are subtle [21, 22]. 
However, declining NK cell number or function in 
aging is associated with death in the elderly [23, 24]. 
Therefore, mechanisms that preserve NK cell number 
and function may promote healthy aging. 
To relate sarcopenia, obesity, and declining immunity in 
aging, we speculated that these conditions are linked 
processes, which are controlled by adipose tissue￾derived and skeletal muscle-derived cytokines, known 
as adipokines and myokines, respectively (Figure 1). As 
a preliminary exploration of this potential relationship, 
we studied body mass index (BMI) and NK cells in 
healthy young (median age 27) and elderly (median age 
>80) women. In the elderly cohort, BMI correlated 
inversely with percentage NK cells and correlated 
directly with NK cell apoptosis rate (Figure 2A, B). 
These relationships were not seen in young women 
(Figure 2C & not shown). As is typical for this age 
group, elderly subjects had a relatively high percentage 
NK cells among blood mononuclear cells, which is due 
both to higher NK cell number and to lower numbers of 
other blood lymphocytes. This may be a protective 
mechanism in the elderly when other leukocyte functions 
decline [17-19]. Our data suggest that the relative 
increase in NK cells with aging is blunted by obesity. 
We propose that the link between body composition 
(the increased ratio of fat to muscle) and immunity in 
aging is due to increased expression of adipokines and 
decreased expression of myokines that affect the 
immune system. In order to explore this proposed link 
(Figure 1), we will review selected adipokines and 
myokines. Many recent reviews have described 
adipokine and myokine effects on muscle, fat, and 
metabolism [3, 25-28], so we will concentrate on how 
adipokines and myokines affect the immune system 
with special reference to NK cells. Starting with 
adipokines, our review indicates that as adipose tissue 
mass increases, the amount of the anti-inflammatory 
cytokine, adiponectin, falls. At the same time, there is a 
rise in the amount of the pro-inflammatory molecules 
leptin, chemerin, resistin, TNF-α, IL-1, and IL-6. These 
proinflammatory adipokines have complex effects on 
NK cells. Therefore, obesity is associated with a 
strongly pro-inflammatory state that promotes 
sarcopenia and may inhibit NK lymphocytes. 
Figure 1. Proposed model of skeletal muscle, adipose tissue, and NK cells in aging. Muscle
negatively regulates adipose tissue via IL‐15 and possibly other myokines.    In turn, inflammatory
adipokines produced by adipose tissue, especially visceral fat, negatively regulate muscle. These same
myokines and adipokines are proposed to affect NK cells. IL‐15 is required for NK cell development and
survival, whereas inflammatory cytokines such as TNF‐α and IL‐6 shorten NK cell survival or stimulate
NK cells to produce pro‐inflammatory IL‐17. During aging, muscle mass, strength, and endurance
decline, which we propose results in less IL‐15 production. At the same time, increased adipose tissue
that is characteristic of aging is associated with increased inflammatory adipokine production. We
propose that these changing myokines and adipokine levels negatively affect NK cells during aging.

Adipose Tissue Cytokines—Adipokines 
Adipokine-producing cells include adipocytes them￾selves, as well as adipose tissue leukocytes. The 
spectrum of secreted adipokines varies with diet (high 
and low fat), energy balance (obese and lean), and 
adipose tissue location (visceral and peripheral). Much 
attention has been focused on adipose tissue 
macrophages, which secrete considerable quantities of 
cytokines. In both mice and humans, high fat diet and 
obesity are associated with increased adipose tissue 
macrophages, which are responsible for secreting most 
of the IL-6 and TNF-α produced by adipose tissue [29]. 
T and NK lymphocytes also reside in adipose tissue 
[30-33], but how they shape adipose tissue macrophage 
activation is not completely understood. In both mice 
and humans, NK cell numbers are higher in visceral fat 
than in other fat depots [31, 32]. Fat-associated NK 
cells have been reported to increase or decrease with 
high fat diet in rodents, depending upon the fat depot 
examined and the cell surface markers used to identify 
NK cells [30, 31, 34]. Knockout of the interferon (IFN)-
γ gene led to a decrease in fat-associated NK1.1+
 cells 
(mostly NK cells) [34]. Given that NK cells are major 
IFN-γ producers, this suggests a potential regulatory 
loop between NK cells and other fat-associated 
leukocytes. In humans, CD56+
 cells (mostly NK cells) 
were more numerous in visceral fat from obese subjects 
than from lean subjects and were more numerous in 
visceral fat than subcutaneous fat [35]. Although the 
exact role of NK cells in adipose tissue has not been 
defined, they are present and are likely to be important. 
Primarily a product of adipocytes, adiponectin declines 
with increasing fat mass [27, 28]. Adiponectin also 
declines with age, although some or all of this may be 
due to increasing fat mass with age [36]. Adiponectin 
activates AMP-activated protein kinase and inhibits NF￾κB signaling, decreasing monocyte, macrophage, and 
dendritic cell production of TNF-α and IFN-γ, while 
increasing anti-inflammatory cytokines, IL-10 and IL￾1Ra [27, 28]. Adiponectin directly inhibits natural killer 
(NK) cells by preventing IL-2-stimulated cytotoxicity 
and IFN-γ production [37]. 
In contrast to adiponectin, serum leptin levels reflect 
overall adipose mass [27]. Leptin increases TNF-α, IL￾6, and IL-12 production by monocytes [27, 38]. 
Therefore, leptin is largely proinflammatory. Leptin 
receptor-deficient (db/db) mice have low NK cell 
numbers [39]. However, no statistically significant 
associations were observed between serum leptin and 
human NK cytotoxicity, lymphocyte populations 
(including NK, CD4 or CD8 T cells, or CD19 B cells),

Figure 2. NK cells are related to BMI in the elderly (A, 34 subjects; B, 30 subjects), but not in the young

or overall T cell proliferation [40]. These findings may 
be related to leptin resistance in obese humans [41], 
because human NK cells respond to short-term leptin 
stimulation in vitro, but not to long-term leptin 
stimulation [42]. Furthermore, NK cells from lean rats, 
but not high fat diet-induced obese rats, showed 
significantly increased cytotoxic activity 4 hours after 
leptin injection [43]. Leptin resistance appears to 
increase in aging rats, even without obesity [44]. 
The leukocyte chemotactic factor, chemerin, is 
produced from the Tazarotene-induced gene 2 as an 
inactive precursor, prochemerin, by many tissues, with 
liver and adipose tissues as major sources [45, 46]. 
Prochemerin is processed by inflammatory, coagulation, 
and fibrinolytic proteolytic enzymes into the active 
chemokine or into inactive products, indicating complex 
regulation. NK cells and most other leukocytes express 
the ChemR23 G-coupled receptor for chemerin and 
migrate toward higher concentrations [45]. Chemerin, 
which increases with obesity [46], may be responsible 
for the NK cell, macrophage, and other leukocyte 
recruitment to adipose tissue. Interestingly, adipocytes 
express both chemerin and ChemR23 and the resulting 
autocrine signaling may contribute to adipocyte 
differentiation [45]. Adipocyte chemerin synthesis is 
elevated by both TNF-α and IL-1β, suggesting a 
possible feed-forward loop of leukocyte recruitment and 
inflammatory cytokine production, leading to greater 
leukocyte recruitment [45]. The effects of aging on 
chemerin production are not known. 
Resistin is made by adipocytes, muscle cells, and 
leukocytes [27]. Resistin induces TNF-α and IL-6 
secretion by human blood leukocytes and, in turn, 
resistin expression is induced by IL-1, TNF-α, and IL-6 
[27, 47], implying a potential feed-forward loop of 
proinflammatory cytokines. Resistin RNA is expressed 
at higher levels in visceral fat than in non-abdominal 
subcutaneous fat [48] and serum resistin levels are 
higher in obese subjects than in lean subjects [49]. 
Resistin does not change with age in healthy subjects 
[36]. To our knowledge, the effects of resistin on NK 
cells, if any, have not been characterized. 
Extracellular nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase 
(Nampt; pre-B-cell colony enhancing factor, PBEF; 
visfatin) upregulates proinflammatory cytokines in 
monocytes, including IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-6 [28]. 
Nampt also induces monocyte cell surface ligands for 
stimulatory lymphocyte receptors, including CD80 (B7-
1), CD40, and CD54 (ICAM-1), increases macrophage 
phagocytosis, and prevents neutrophil apoptosis [28, 
50]. Although it had been touted as a product of visceral 
adipose tissue, Nampt is produced by many tissues, 
including skeletal muscle [51-53]. Nampt measurement 
is sensitive to assay variation and it is not clear whether 
blood Nampt levels correlate with fat mass [54]. To our 
knowledge, the effects of Nampt on NK cells and the 
effects of aging on extracellular Nampt production have 
not been studied. 
Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) is a powerful 
proinflammatory cytokine that is made primarily by 
monocyte, macrophages, and similar cells, such as liver 
Kupffer cells and brain microglia. TNF-α also is made 
by other cells including, B, T, and NK lymphocytes, 
and by adipocytes [55]. TNF-α also is made by human 
skeletal muscle, especially from diabetic subjects, and 
when cells are stimulated with proinflammatory 
cytokines, including TNF-α itself [56, 57]. In visceral 
adipose tissue, TNF-α is made predominantly by 
adipose tissue macrophages [29, 32, 58]. The elevated 
systemic TNF-α that is strongly associated with obesity 
comes largely from visceral adipose tissue [29, 59]. 
TNF-α increases with age, even among healthy subjects 
[60, 61]. Although largely proinflammatory, TNF-α
causes T cell and NK cell apoptosis under some 
circumstances [62-64]. 
IL-6 is produced by many cells, including adipocytes, 
adipose tissue macrophages, and myocytes [28, 29]. IL￾6 levels rise with obesity and with age [29, 60, 61, 65-
67]. Chronic IL-6 elevation might have different effects 
than the transient elevations that are found after exercise 
[68]. IL-6 has many effects on the immune system, 
which are generally pro-inflammatory, including 
promotion of pro-inflammatory TH17 cells, IL-17-
producing NK cells, and suppression of regulatory T 
cells [69, 70]. However, IL-6 may be anti-inflammatory 
in some circumstances in humans because it inhibits 
TNF-α release, both basally and in response to 
endotoxin infusion, and it induces release of anti￾inflammatory molecules, IL-1Ra, IL-10, and cortisol 
[71, 72]. 
Proinflammatory IL-1β and IL-1α are produced by 
many cells, including adipocytes and myocytes, but 
most prominently by monocytes and macrophages. The 
IL-1 receptor-blocking protein, IL-1Ra (anakinra), has 
been successfully used to treat many autoinflammatory 
diseases, providing strong evidence for the pro￾inflammatory nature of IL-1β and IL-1α [73]. In 
obesity, fat tissue is a source of IL-1 [74] and human 
IL-1β rises with age [61]. IL-1β supported a unique IL￾22+
 subpopulation of secondary lymphoid tissue “stage 
3” immature NK cells and promoted the proliferation of 
a specialized class of IL-22+ NK-22 mucosal cells [75, 
76]. For conventional NK cells, the picture was

mixed—IL-1β inhibited development of conventional 
NK cells, but with IL-12 co-stimulated immature 
CD56bright NK cells to produce IFN-γ [75, 77]. 
Serum IL-10 may be positively correlated with obesity 
in middle aged humans [78]. Exercise releases IL-10 
into the circulation, implying production by skeletal 
muscle [3]. Macrophage IL-10 production increases in 
old mice [79, 80]. However, serum IL-10 levels are 
quite variable in elderly humans. One study showed a 
significant age-related increase in serum IL-10, whereas 
an earlier study did not show a significant difference 
between middle-aged and very old humans [61, 67]. IL￾10 is broadly anti-inflammatory, inhibiting antigen 
presentation and suppressing release of TNF-α, IL-2, 
IFN-γ, IL-4, and other cytokines [81]. The immuno￾regulatory nature of IL-10 is illustrated by the fact that 
several viruses encode IL-10 homologues [81]. The 
effect of IL-10 on NK cells is variable, depending upon 
context. IL-10 stimulated NK cell proliferation, 
cytotoxicity, and cytokine secretion in vitro when 
combined with IL-2 [82]. In murine cytomegalovirus￾infected mice, IL-10 promoted NK cell cytotoxic 
granule release, but increased NK cell activation￾induced cell death [83]. 
Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) is produced by 
many cells, including adipose tissue macrophages in 
insulin resistance and NK cells in both constitutive and 
activation-dependent fashions [84, 85]. Although total 
serum TGF-β levels do not change with age, active 
TGF-β levels do increase [67]. TGF-β inhibits NK cell 
cytotoxicity, IFN-γ production, and homeostasis, by 
downregulating important NK cell receptors, including 
the IFN-α receptor, IL-2Rα, NKp30, and NKG2D [84]. 
Therefore, adipose-derived TGF-β might negatively 
regulate NK cells. 
In summary, as adipose tissue mass increases, the amount 
of anti-inflammatory adiponectin decreases and the 
amounts of the pro-inflammatory molecules leptin, 
chemerin, resistin, TNF-α, IL-1, and IL-6 increase. 
Obesity is associated with a strongly pro-inflammatory 
state that has complex effects on NK lymphocytes. 
Because of these complicated relationships, it is not 
surprising that obesity per se did not correlate with NK 
cell number or activity in several studies [86-88]. 
However, obese patients with metabolic syndrome or 
components of metabolic syndrome had low NK cell 
number and/or activity. For example, when Lynch et al. 
[88] separated obese subjects with and without 
components of the metabolic syndrome, those with 
metabolic syndrome components had significantly lower 
NK cell number and less NK cell activation than obese 
subjects without metabolic syndrome components. In a 
study of obese patients undergoing bariatric surgery, 
patients had lost weight and improved many components 
associated with the metabolic syndrome 6 months after 
surgery [89]. Although there was no change in CD56+
cell number (which would include NK cells and some T 
cells), NK cell activity greatly increased after surgery 
[89]. Given that low muscle mass and strength are a 
frequent in patients with metabolic syndrome [90, 91], 
this suggested that sarcopenia could synergize with 
excess adipose tissue to affect NK cells, as was implied 
by our preliminary study (Figure 2). 
Below we review myokines that have been shown to 
affect NK cells, with special emphasis on IL-15. 
Declining muscle mass is expected to produce less IL￾15, a myokine that regulates adipose tissue and 
promotes NK cell development and survival. Therefore, 
sarcopenia is expected to hinder NK cells. 
Skeletal Muscle Cytokines—Myokines 
Skeletal muscle secretes multiple cytokines, including 
Nampt, TNF-α, and IL-6, which were discussed above. 
Muscle also produces IL-8, brain-derived neurotrophic 
factor, and leukemia inhibitory factor, which are 
notsecreted into the circulation in large amounts, and 
fibroblast growth factor-21, which has unknown effects 
on the immune system. Insulin-like growth factor-I 
(IGF-I) is made by liver, skeletal muscle, monocytes, 
and other cells. IGF-I administration enhances mouse 
lymphoid and myeloid reconstitution after allogeneic 
bone marrow transplantation [92]. The relatively high 
level of type-1 IGF receptors on NK cells suggests that 
IGF-I is likely to affect NK cells [93], but this has not 
been documented. 
IL-15 mRNA is expressed in many tissues [94], but IL￾15 biosynthesis is very complex and RNA levels do not 
necessarily indicate protein secretion. IL-15 isoforms 
have alternative signal peptides of 21 and 48 amino 
acids. Although the shorter form is more conventional 
in length, it has a noncanonical Kozak translational 
initiation sequence and is poorly expressed [95]. The 
IL-15 long signal peptide isoform also has several 
features that cause poor protein expression, including an 
abnormal length and the presence of 12 “decoy” AUGs 
in the 5’UTR. IL-15 mRNA also has poorly defined 
inhibitory elements in the 3’UTR. These features 
partially account for low IL-15 protein expression 
despite abundant RNA in many cells. 
Importantly, IL-15 requires the presence of IL-15Rα for 
efficient biosynthesis and secretion [96, 97]. IL-15 and 
IL-15Rα have high affinity (~10-10 Kd), bind within the

cell, are transported to the cell membrane, and are shed 
in a process that involves the matrix metalloproteinase, 
ADAM17 [98-100]. Another secretory route has been 
proposed in which alternative RNA splicing produces a 
soluble IL-15Rα (sIL-15Rα) protein that is mostly 
limited to the IL-15-binding “sushi” domain. Although 
recombinant “sushi-only” sIL-15Rα has somewhat 
reduced affinity for IL-15 compared with shed sIL￾15Rα, soluble “sushi-only” complexes might be 
secreted [100]. Either spliced “sushi-only” or shed sIL￾15Rα is absolutely required for IL-15 secretion. 
Because of their high affinity, sIL-15Rα/IL-15 
complexes have a long (12 hour) half-life [100]. 
However, the total serum IL-15 concentration is low, 
perhaps ~6-20 pg/ml (~10-12 M) in healthy subjects 
[101, 102], favoring complex dissociation. Human 
“free” (non-complexed) IL-15 had a circulating half-life 
of only about 1 hour when injected into mice [103]. 
This is expected because, at 14-15 kDa mass, IL-15 
probably is rapidly filtered by the kidneys [104]. As a 
result, most or all of IL-15 is bound to IL-15Rα in 
human and mouse serum, at least when IL-15 levels are 
elevated by lymphocyte-depleting treatments [105]. 
Like IL-15, IL-15Rα synthesis is widespread within and 
outside of lymphoid tissues. Skeletal muscle tissue 
produces very high levels of IL-15, and expresses IL￾15Rα [106]. Because skeletal muscle is the largest 
organ system in the body, these observations suggest 
that skeletal muscle could be an important IL-15 
producer with endocrine effects at distant sites. IL-15 
levels are reported to increase transiently immediately 
following resistance [107] and aerobic [108] exercise, 
suggesting that IL-15 is indeed released from muscle 
tissue. In mice, muscle and serum IL-15 protein levels 
decline progressively with advanced age [109]. In 
agreement with the above-mentioned lack of correlation 
between IL-15 protein levels and mRNA expression, the 
age-related decline in muscle IL-15 protein was not 
associated with decreases in IL-15 mRNA levels [109]. 
However, an age-related decline in expression of 
mRNA coding for the “sushi-only” isoform of sIL-15Rα
was observed, suggesting the reduction in this factor 
resulted in reduced IL-15 secretion and stability in 
aging mice [109]. A study of aging rats showed the 
longevity-promoting regimen of calorie restriction 
prevented the age-related declines in muscle IL-15 
expression observed in ad libitum-fed rats [110]. IL-15 
is reported to prevent muscle protein degradation in 
certain model systems [111-113]. In an intriguing brief 
report involving human subjects, Gangemi et al. [114] 
observed significantly elevated serum IL-15 levels in 
centenarians living independently, suggesting high 
expression of IL-15 conferred protection from both 
frailty and age-related disease. 
IL-15 also has important effects on adipose tissue. IL￾15 inhibits adipocyte differentiation in culture and 
obese people have low blood IL-15 levels [102, 106, 
115]. IL-15 deficient mice become obese despite 
unaltered food consumption; IL-15 injection reversed 
both this obesity and diet-induced obesity, lowered 
glucose levels, and increased insulin sensitivity [102, 
116]. Consistent with these findings, high IL-15 levels 
caused lean body type, decreased white adipose tissue, 
and increased adipose tissue NK cell number [102, 112, 
117]. These and other data support the conclusion that 
IL-15 regulates adipose tissue [3, 106, 115]. 
IL-15 is best known for its effect on the immune 
system. NK cells and select T cell subsets express three 
chains important for IL-15 signaling: a signal￾transducing γ chain (CD132) that is used by several 
cytokine receptors, an IL-15-binding β chain (CD122) 
that is important for both IL-15 and IL-2 signaling and 
is often referred to as the IL-2Rβ chain, and an α chain 
(IL-15Rα) that, as noted above, binds IL-15 with high 
affinity [95, 100]. Complexes of these three chains on 
lymphocytes are referred to as IL-15Rαβγ. NK cells 
absolutely require IL-15, as IL-15 and IL-15Rα
knockout mice have virtually no mature NK cells and 
normal NK cells rapidly die when transferred into these 
mice [118-121]. IL-15 elevates bcl-2 and protects NK 
cells from apoptosis [122, 123]. Two observations 
indicate that physiological IL-15 levels are rate-limiting 
for NK cells: heterozygous IL-15 knockout mice have 
low NK cell number and exogenous IL-15 boosts NK 
cell number in both normal mice and primates [119, 
124, 125]. Specific T cell subsets also depend upon IL￾15, including CD8 memory cells, NKT cells, and some 
intraepithelial T cells [118, 119, 126]. 
In addition to being shed, IL-15Rα/IL-15 complexes 
can be stably expressed on cell membranes. Both 
soluble and cell surface IL-15Rα/IL-15 complexes 
prolong IL-15 stability and effectively stimulate NK 
cells and T cells, a process called transpresentation [96, 
97, 127, 128]. Multiple lines of evidence indicate that 
NK cells and certain T cell subsets require IL-15Rα
expression by other cells, but need not express it 
themselves [127, 128]. Several groups have investigated 
which cells are critical for IL-15 transpresentation in 
vivo. In adoptive transfer experiments, IL-15Rα
expression by both radiosensitive hematopoietic cells 
and radioresistant stromal cells were required for 
optimal lymphocyte maturation [126, 128]. In 
particular, peripheral NK cells were partially 
supported by IL-15Rα/IL-15 expression by either 
hematopoietic or nonhematopoietic cells, but both 
compartments were required for optimal NK cell

number [121, 126, 128]. Mortier et al. selectively 
knocked out IL-15Rα expression within the 
hematopoietic compartment. Knockout of IL-15Rα in 
either dendritic cells or macrophages produced partial 
loss of NK cells in peripheral organs, but not in the 
bone marrow [129]. Curiously, loss of IL-15Rα
expression in both dendritic cells and macrophages 
produced similar results to that of either knockout 
separately [129]. Furthermore, survival of normal 
transferred NK cells into either knockout animal was 
normal. Together, these results indicate that 
nonhematopoietic cells contribute significantly to NK 
cell maturation and survival. 
Because IL-15Rα is required for IL-15 biosynthesis, 
stability, and transpresentation, it is relevant to consider 
the role of IL-15Rα in NK and T cells, which do not 
produce IL-15. Logically, if transpresentation is both 
necessary and sufficient for IL-15 signaling, then there 
would be no need for IL-15Rα expression on 
responding NK and T lymphocytes. However, 
considerable data indicate that lymphocyte IL-15Rα is 
required for optimal response to IL-15. As a first 
consideration, it is clear that IL-15Rαβγ+
 lymphocytes 
can respond to free IL-15. Cell lines expressing human 
IL-15Rαβγ responded with exquisite sensitivity to 
human IL-15 (about 10 pM) [130]. sIL-15Rα may 
prevent free IL-15 from binding to lymphocyte IL￾15Rα because these cell lines were inhibited from 
growing in response to IL-15 when sIL-15Rα was 
included, with an IC50 of 3-10 pM [98, 130]. Similarly, 
a human T cell line was rescued from cell death by IL￾15, but this was abolished when IL-15Rα was included 
in the medium [131]. IL-15Rα also inhibited allogeneic 
responses in vivo [131]. Lymphocytes with only IL￾15Rβγ bind IL-15 with approximately 700-fold lower 
affinity than those with IL-15Rαβγ [132]. Mouse CTLL 
T cells responded well to free IL-15, but CTLL variants 
that expressed little IL-15Rα did not [130, 131]. The 
presence of sIL-15Rα inhibited the proliferative 
response to IL-15 by CTLL, but enhanced the 
proliferation by IL-15Rα-low CTLL cells [130, 131]. 
The effect of sIL-15Rα on lymphocyte response to free 
IL-15 may depend upon the ratio of “complete” IL￾15Rαβγ to “incomplete” IL-15Rβγ on the lymphocyte 
cell surface. Collectively, these data indicate that IL￾15Rαβγ+
 lymphocytes respond with exquisite 
sensitivity to free IL-15. 
NK and T lymphocytes express IL-15Rβγ, allowing 
them to respond to sIL-15Rα/IL-15 complexes, in 
addition to IL-15Rα/IL-15 transpresented on cell 
surfaces. The ratio of IL-15Rαβγ to IL-15Rβγ likely 
depends upon the state of cell activation. Free IL-15 
stimulated resting human NK cells, but IL-15Rα
expression was transient and disappeared by 48 hours, 
possibly due to ADAM17-induced cleavage from the 
NK cell surface [133]. However, activated NK cells still 
responded to sIL-15Rα/IL-15 complexes [133]. Thus, 
NK cells require IL-15Rα to respond to “free” IL-15 
and NK cells that have low cell surface IL-15Rα can 
respond to transpresented IL-15Rα/IL-15 complexes 
that are soluble or that are on the surface of neighboring 
cells. 
It is important to address apparent species and cell line 
differences that complicate the IL-15 literature. For 
mouse lymphocytes, “full length” shed IL-15Rα
inhibits signaling when complexed with IL-15 [130, 
131]. This also is true for transfectants that may express 
high levels of human IL-15Rα [98]. However, for 
human blood lymphocytes, “full length” sIL-15Rα/IL￾15 complexes either further stimulate or have only a 
minor inhibitory effect, compared with IL-15 alone [99, 
130, 134]. Thus sIL-15Rα/IL-15 complexes, whether 
derived from “shed” or “spliced” IL-15Rα, likely 
stimulate human IL-15Rβγ+
 NK lymphocytes in vivo. 
Hypothesis 
As noted above, physiological IL-15 levels are rate￾limiting for NK cells. This implies that any source of 
IL-15 will boost NK cell number and function. As also 
noted above, knockout studies indicate that non￾hematopoietic cells play an important role in NK 
homeostasis. Although cell surface transpresentation is 
likely to efficiently deliver IL-15 proliferation and 
survival signals to NK cells and T cells in a juxtacrine 
fashion, we propose that soluble IL-15Rα/IL-15 
complexes and free IL-15 provide a small but 
significant endocrine effect. Given the size of the 
skeletal muscle tissue and its abundant production of 
IL-15 and IL-15Rα, we propose that skeletal muscle 
contributes to NK cell homeostasis. As a corollary, we 
propose that muscle wasting results in lower available 
sIL-15Rα/IL-15 complex and free IL-15 levels, leading 
to less robust NK cell homeostasis. When muscle 
wasting is combined with elevated inflammatory 
cytokines produced by adipose tissue, some of which 
negatively affect NK cells, we predict that this lowers 
NK cell number and survival, much as we saw in 
elderly female subjects with high BMI. Relevant to this 
concept, chronic diseases of the lung, heart, and kidney 
are characterized by muscle wasting and low NK cell 
numbers [135-138]. Obesity, loss of muscle, and low 
NK cell number all predict mortality in the elderly [23, 
24, 139-141], suggesting that these factors might

combine to promote diseases of the elderly, including 
infection and cancer.
