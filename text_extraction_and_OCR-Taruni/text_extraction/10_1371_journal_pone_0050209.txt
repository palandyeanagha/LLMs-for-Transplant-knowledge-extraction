Abstract
Proteinuria is an important cause of progressive tubulo-interstitial damage. Whether proteinuria could trigger a renal
lymphangiogenic response has not been established. Moreover, the temporal relationship between development of
fibrosis, inflammation and lymphangiogenesis in chronic progressive kidney disease is not clear yet. Therefore, we evaluated
the time course of lymph vessel (LV) formation in relation to proteinuria and interstitial damage in a rat model of chronic
unilateral adriamycin nephrosis. Proteinuria and kidneys were evaluated up to 30 weeks after induction of nephrosis. LVs
were identified by podoplanin/VEGFR3 double staining. After 6 weeks proteinuria was well-established, without influx of
interstitial macrophages and myofibroblasts, collagen deposition, osteopontin expression (tubular activation) or LV
formation. At 12 weeks, a ,3-fold increase in cortical LV density was found (p,0.001), gradually increasing over time. This
corresponded with a significant increase in tubular osteopontin expression (p,0.01) and interstitial myofibroblast numbers
(p,0.05), whereas collagen deposition and macrophage numbers were not yet increased. VEGF-C was mostly expressed by
tubular cells rather than interstitial cells. Cultured tubular cells stimulated with FCS showed a dose-dependent increase in
mRNA and protein expression of VEGF-C which was not observed by human albumin stimulation. We conclude that chronic
proteinuria provoked lymphangiogenesis in temporal conjunction with tubular osteopontin expression and influx of
myofibroblasts, that preceded interstitial fibrosis.

Introduction
Proteinuria is a noticeable risk factor for development of chronic
kidney disease (CKD) and its reduction has renoprotective effects,
slowing down progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) [1–
3]. Proteinuria is not only a marker of renal failure progression,
but is directly involved in the pathogenesis of tubulointerstitial
fibrosis in the kidney as well [4].
Proximal tubular epithelial cells, experimentally exposed to
pathologically high concentrations of plasma proteins, display
several biologic responses, including profibrogenic signalling,
inflammation, apoptosis, production of reactive oxygen species
and epithelial dedifferentiation, which ultimately contribute to
tubulointerstitial fibrosis [5–8]. With progression of the disease,
macrophages become gradually involved in lesions, and this
enhances proteinuria-induced renal structural changes into
macrophage-dependent interstitial fibrosis [9,10]. Tubulointerstit￾ial fibrosis is important in long-term renal prognosis since it
determines renal function and predict the outcome better than any
other histopathological finding [11,12]. The extent of proteinuria￾induced tubulointerstitial changes limits the efficacy of antiprotei￾nuric and renoprotective treatment with renin–angiotensin system
(RAS) blockers [13], even when the changes are still within the
pro-fibrotic range, highlighting the importance of tubulointerstitial
damages in response to therapy in proteinuric patients. This
warrants better exploration of the (pro-)fibrotic response to
proteinuria.
Lymphatic vessels contribute to the drainage of extravasated
proteins, excess fluid and macromolecules from interstitial tissue
and return them to the blood circulation via the lymph, playing a
crucial role in tissue fluid balance and homeostasis [14,15]. They
are also essential for immune defense by carrying antigens and
antigen-presenting cells from the interstitium to the lymph nodes,
a critical step for the development of an immune response [16].
The growth of lymphatic vessels (lymphangiogenesis) has been
shown to be actively involved in adult tissues during various
diseases such as inflammation, obesity, hypertension, tumour
metastasis, organ transplantation and lymphedema [17], and very
recently shown to be involved in development of fibrosis, at least in
pulmonary fibrosis [18].
Renal lymphangiogenesis has been reported in transplanted
kidneys [19,20], and in nephropathies with interstitial fibrosis.
Lymphangiogenesis generally correlated with the degree of tissue
fibrosis rather than inflammation [21]. Recently, transforming
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 November 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 11 | e50209

growth factor-b (TGF-b) has been shown to induce VEGF-C
expression in tubular epithelial cell which promote lymphangio￾genesis [22]. Whether proteinuria could trigger a renal lymphan￾giogenic response has not been established. Studies up to now are
mostly cross-sectional, and the temporal relationship between
development of fibrosis, inflammation and lymphangiogenesis in
chronic progressive kidney disease is not clear yet. To resolve these
relationships, we performed a time-course study, up to 30 weeks,
in adriamycin nephropathy in rats. We used a unilateral model to
minimize possible effects of uremic condition and renal tissue
oedema. Our study reveals that the formation of renal interstitial
lymph vessels occurs after established proteinuria. The new
lymphatic vessels are formed prior to collagen deposition and
fibrosis, macrophage influx and in conjunction with the tubular
osteopontin expression and VEGF-C production.
Materials and Methods
Animal Experimental Protocol
Unilateral adriamycin nephrosis was established in male Wister
rats weighing 275–300 g, using a technique described previously
[23]. Briefly, the left kidney was approached by means of an
abdominal midline incision under isoflurane anesthesia (1.5%
isoflurane in N2O/O2). An adjustable clamp was placed around
the aorta above the left renal artery. Then, an injection of
adriamycin (1.5 mg/kg) was performed in the tail vein. 12 minutes
later, once adriamycin had been eliminated from the circulation
[24], the clamp was removed. Rats in control group underwent the
same surgical procedure with saline injection. Rats were placed in
metabolic cages for 24-h urine collection bi-weekly, and protein￾uria was determined in urine samples by a BNII third-generation
nephelometer (Dade Behring, Mannheim, Germany). At different
time points (week 6, 12, 18, 24, and 30) after the injection of
adriamycin, 6 rats were sacrificed, and kidneys were harvested
after perfusion with saline.
In a separate bilateral adriamycin experiment, an intervention
was done from week 6 to week 12 by the ACE inhibitor lisinopril
(75 mg/l drinking water) in combination with low salt (0.05%) diet
(n = 7 rats). Control adriamycin rats just received low salt diet from
week 6 to week 12 (n = 6 rats). At week 12, 24-hours urine was
collected in metabolic cages, animals were sacrificed and kidneys
preserved for histology.
All experimental protocols for animal studies followed the
national guide for the care and use of laboratory animals, and
were approved by the local Animal Ethic Committee of the
University of Groningen.
Immunohistochemistry and Immunofluorescence
Stainings were performed on both paraffin-embedded and cryo
sections. Three-micron thick formalin-fixed paraffin sections were
deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated. Antigen retrieval was
done for 10 min in citrate buffer, PH:6.0 or 10 mM Tris–1 mM
EDTA buffer, pH: 9.0 in a microwave oven, and endogenous
peroxidase activity was blocked with 0.3% hydrogen peroxide.
Four-micrometer thick frozen sections were fixed in acetone
and treated with 0.03% hydrogen peroxide. Sections were
pretreated with normal goat, rabbit or mouse serum, and
subsequently incubated for 1 hr with the following primary
antibodies: rabbit anti-LYVE-1 (Kind gift from Prof. David
Jackson, John Radcliffe University Hospital, Oxford, UK),
mouse anti-rat Podoplanin (Angio Bio, Del Mar, USA), Goat
anti-mouse VEGFR3 (R&D system, Inc), mouse anti rat CD68
(Clone ED1, AbD Serotec, UK), rabbit anti-rat VEGF-C
(RELIATech, GmbH, Germany), mouse anti-a-SMA (clone
1A4; Sigma), rabbit anti-collagen type I and rabbit anti-collagen
type III (both from Biogenesis, Poole, UK). Binding of primary
antibodies was detected by incubating the sections for 30 min
with secondary antibodies diluted in PBS +1% normal rat
serum: HRP-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse, biotinylated rabbit
anti-mouse, FITC-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse, HRP-conjugat￾ed rabbit anti-goat, HRP and FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit
and goat-anti mouse (all from DAKO, Belgium). As negative
controls, the primary antibodies were omitted and replaced by
PBS with normal rat serum. HRP and BIOT activity were

visualized using the TSATM Tetramethylrhodamine System
(PerkinElmer LAS Inc., USA) and FITC-conjugated streptavidin
(Invitrogen) respectively. DAPI (Vector Laboratories, Inc) was
used to stain nuclei. For paraffin sections, bound antibodies
were visualized by the peroxidase substrate 3,39-diaminobenzi￾dine (DAB) (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) then counterstained with
Periodic Acid Schiff (PAS).
Renal Histomorphology
Focal glomerulosclerosis (FGS), interstitial macrophages,
myofibroblasts, osteopontin, collagen I and III were measured
as described previously [23]. Briefly, interstitial macrophages
(ED1 positive), myofibroblasts (a-SMA positive), osteopontin,
collagen I and III immunostainings were evaluated in 50
cortical tubulo-interstitial images per slide using computerized
image analysis (Advanced QUIPS, Leica Imaging Systems,
Cambridge, UK) on blinded sections. The sections were semi￾quantitatively scored for focal glomerulosclerosis in a blinded
fashion by determining the level of mesangial expansion and
focal adhesion in each quadrant in a glomerulus and expressed
on a scale from 0 to 4 [25]. In total, 50 glomeruli per kidney
were analyzed, and the total FGS score was calculated by
multiplying the score by the percentage of glomeruli with the
same FGS score. The sum of these scores gives the total FGS
score with a maximum of 400.
Double Immunofluorescence Protocol for Lymph Vessel
Identification and Quantification
For identification of lymph vessels we applied a double￾immunofluorescence protocol, using two primary antibodies
against podoplanin and VEGFR3. After acetone fixation, frozen
sections were blocked by 0.03% H2O2, followed by 20 minute
incubating with appropriate normal serum. Then, sections were
treated with mouse anti-rat podoplanin and goat anti-mouse
VEGFR3 primary antibodies for 1 hr in room temperature. After
washing three times with PBS (Phosphate buffered saline), FITC

arrows) were present in the kidneys of saline-injected rats adjacent to large and middle-size arteries (A), and barely observed in cortical interstitial
area, even in proteinuric kidneys at week 6 (B), however were clearly induced in the kidneys of adriamycin-injected rats at 12 weeks (C). Interstitial
localization of these podoplanin-positive vessels becomes clear by the recognition of PAS-positive tubules. Double staining for podoplanin and LYVE￾1 (D–F) and for podoplanin and VEGFR3 (G–I) confirmed interstitial podoplanin positive structures to be lymphatic endothelial cells, both in large and
small lymphatic vessels. (Bar = 100 mm).

and HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies applied for 30 minutes
to give each marker different colors. After staining, the sections
were scanned using a Tissue FAXS acquisition system (Tissue
Gnostics, Austria) based on a Zeiss Axio Observer Z1 (Zeiss,
Germany). Microscopic fluorescence imaging was performed at
the UMCG Microscopy and Imaging Center (UMIC), which is
supported by the Netherlands Organisation for Health Research
and Development (ZonMW grant 40-00506-98-9021). Double
stained vessel structures which were positive for both markers
(merged colors) counted as lymph vessels and measured by using a
homemade macro on ImageJ 1.41 (Rasband, W.S., U.S. National
Institutes of Health). A total of 30 fields per kidney cortex were
evaluated and the lymphatic vessel density (LVD) was quantified
as number of double positive (Podoplanin+/VEGFR3+), intersti￾tial vascular profiles per medium-power field (206objective).
The surface area of lymph vessels were also evaluated using
Image J program, and lymph vessel size was differentiated into
four size categories, namely: very small, small, medium- sized and
larger lymph vessels.
Tubular Epithelial Cell Culture
Human HK-2 cells (proximal tubular epithelial cell line) from
American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA)
were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM)
and Ham’s F-12 medium (Invitrogen-Gibco), supplemented with
Insulin (5 mg/ml), Transferrin (5 mg/ml), Selenium (5 ng/ml),
hydrocortison (36 ng/ml), Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF)
(10 ng/ml), penicillin (50 U/ml) and streptomycin (50 mg/ml).
The cells were cultured in 12-well plates until 90% confluency,
then starved for two days without EGF. We stimulated the cells
afterwards with different concentrations of FCS (Fetal Calf Serum,
from Sigma-Aldrich), 5, 10 and 20% for 24 hours. Supernatant
was collected for ELISA measurement, cells were washed with
PBS (phosphate-buffered saline), and RNA was isolated for RT￾PCR.
RNA Extraction and Real-Time PCR
Total RNA was extracted using RNeasy Micro kit (Qiagen), and
cDNA was synthesized using QuantiTect Reverse Transcriptase
Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer guidelines. The
VEGF-C primer was QuantiTect Primer Assay (Qiagen,
QT00175301), and as housekeeping gene, Glyceraldehyde 3-
phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was used. Real-time PCR
was performed using CFX384TM Real-Time System (Bio Rad)
with SYBR Green assay (SensiMixTM, Bioline). Mean Ct values of

have been divided into four categories based on their size. At 6 weeks, small, middle-size and large lymph vessels were present in close association
with larger blood vessels, however there were almost no very small LV, indicating no lymph vessel formation. Over time, the number of very small LV
significantly increased up to week 24. Besides, the number of small, middle-size and large LV increased between week 6–12 and/or between weeks
24–30, implying growth and enlargement of LV in these time frames. (**p,0.01; ***p,0.001).

samples were normalized to the GAPDH value (DCt), and relative
results were expressed as 22DCt.
VEGF-C ELISA Measurement
The level of VEGF-C protein secreted into cell culture
supernatant was measured by Human VEGF-C Immunoassay
kit (R&D Systems, Wiesbaden-Nordernstadt, Germany), accord￾ing to manufacturer’s instructions. Supernatant was collected from
HK-2 cells stimulated by FCS. Medium alone, and medium +20%
FCS were used as controls. Three individual experiments in
duplicate were carried out.
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 16.0 (SPSS Inc.,
Chicago, IL) and figures were made using GraphPad Prism 5.0
(GraphPad Software Inc, La Jolla, CA). Differences among groups
were tested using two way ANOVA with Tukey post-hoc analysis.
Similar test was performed for non-parametric values after log
transformation. Since many kidneys had FGS score of zero, the
difference was tested with Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn’s post-hoc
analysis. P,0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Results
Clinical Parameters
Proteinuria was significantly increased in adriamycin-injected
rats, compared to saline-injected controls. It was significantly
increased as of 3 weeks (data not shown), and reached a plateau of
,200–250 mg/24 h at twelve weeks after induction of nephrosis
(Fig. 1A). FGS developed over time, with statistical difference from
control as of 12 weeks (Fig. 1B). Rats in control groups developed a
mild proteinuria over time, attributed to the normal process of
aging. Serum creatinine concentrations, systolic blood pressures
(SBP) and body weights were similar among all study groups (not
shown).

Lymph Vessel Number Increased in Conjunction with
Tubular Activation but before Interstitial Fibrosis
Kidneys from adriamycin-injected rats showed the development
of podoplanin-positive cells and vessel-like structures in the cortical
interstitium (Fig. 2B and C), which were not seen in saline-injected
control rats. In control renal tissues podoplanin-positive lymph
vessels were only seen in close conjunction with larger arteries,
mostly in deeper cortical regions (Fig. 2A). This strongly suggested
the development of a podoplanin-positive lymphatic network in
the cortical tubulo-interstitial compartment over time in protein￾uric adriamycin rats. To be sure that these podoplanin-positive
cells and vessel-like structures resembled lymphatic endothelium,
we performed double staining for podoplanin with two other well￾established markers for lymphatic endothelium namely VEGFR3
and LYVE-1. Indeed, almost all (more than 95%) interstitial
podoplanin-positive cells and vessels were also positive for
VEGFR3 and LYVE-1 (Fig. 2D–I), proving them to be lymphatic
endothelial cells. Fig. 3A shows the absence of a lymphangiogenic
response at 6 weeks after adriamycin injection, although protein￾uria was already established with values around ,100 mg/24 h.
At 6 weeks no tubular activation (evidenced by tubular osteopontin
expression), no interstitial accumulation of a-SMA positive
myofibroblasts or interstitial influx of ED-1 positive macrophages
was found (Fig. 3B–D). At week 12 a clear increase in lymphatics
was observed, significantly different from week 6 (Fig. 3A,
p,0.001). Evaluation of other tubulo-interstitial parameters
revealed tubular activation (Fig. 3B, osteopontin week 12 versus
week 6, p,0.01). Interstitial myofibroblasts were significantly
increased at week 12 compared to week 6 as well (Fig. 3C,
p,0.03), but interstitial macrophages (Fig. 3D), and interstitial
fibrosis, evidenced by the interstitial collagens type I and type III
were not yet increased at week 12 (Fig. 3E and F). From week 12
to week 30 a further increase of lymph vessels was found (Fig. 3A).
Along, tubular activation (osteopontin), and interstitial accumula￾tion of myofibroblasts and macrophages was observed (Fig. 3B–D).
At weeks 24 and 30 interstitial collagen I significantly increased
compared to week 6 (Fig. 3E, both time points p,0.01). Collagen
III did only show a significant increase at week 30 compare to
weeks 12 (Fig. 3F). In the control groups all interstitial parameters
showed minor non-significant increase related to ageing of the
animals. (Fig. 3A–F). These temporal data support a tubulo￾interstitial lymphangiogenic response secondary to proteinuria, in
conjunction with tubular activation by osteopontin expression and
myofibroblast accumulation, however preceding interstitial in￾flammation (macrophage influx) and interstitial fibrosis. These
findings are exemplified in Fig. 4.
Size Distribution of Lymphatic Vessels Showed the
Growth of Newly Formed LV Over Time
We analyzed surface area of all quantified lymphatic vessels in
the kidneys from all adriamycin-injected rats. Based on the size
distribution we divided them into four categories as shown in
Figure 5. The distribution at 6 weeks showed the presence of small,
middle-size and large lymph vessels. These are the already existing
vessels present in close conjunction with larger arteries. No very
small lymphatic structures are found at week 6, indicating the
absence of new lymph vessel formation at week 6. At week 12, a
significant increase is found in very small, small and medium-sized
lymph structures (varying from single cells to very small vessel
structures), indicating the occurrence of lymphangiogenesis and
some size growth/maturation of lymph vessels. Between week 12
and 24 lymphangiogenesis continues, based on a further increase
in very small lymphatic structures. In this time frame however, no
growth/maturation of small, middle-size and large lymph vessels
occurred. In the last phase, from week 24 to week 30,
lymphangiogenesis decreased, whereas growth/maturation signif￾icantly increased. We conclude that growth, i.e. widening of vessel
diameter, occurred mainly between weeks 6–12 and 24–30,
whereas new lymph vessel formation takes place from week 6–24.
Lymphangiogenesis is Seen in Conjunction with VEGF-C
Positive Tubular Cells
Since VEGF-C has been described as a major lymphangio￾genic factor in renal pathologies [16,17], we stained renal tissues
from adriamycin-injected rats at 12 weeks for VEGF-C. Many
proximal tubules clearly showed VEGF-C expression in a baso￾lateral fashion (Fig. 6, left panel). Podoplanin-positive lymph
vessels were observed in close conjunction with tubuli positive
for VEGF-C (Fig. 6, lowest panel). VEGF-C expression was also
observed in a number of interstitial cells. To identify these
VEGF-C positive interstitial cells we performed various double
stainings for VEGF-C with a-SMA (myofibroblasts), ED-1
(macrophages), NG2 (pericytes), FSP-1 (fibroblasts), or CD31
(PECAM, endothelial cells). Although low percentages of all
these different cell types (all ,5%) showed some double
positivity with VEGF-C, the majority of these cells did not
express VEGF-C (Fig. 6. as an example just ED1 (middle panel)
and a-SMA (top panel) is shown). Thus, we were not able to
identify the phenotype of most interstitial cells which showed
VEGF-C positive staining. Since however, main VEGF-C
expression was observed in tubular epithelial cells and also the
newly formed lymph vessels were mainly found closely to
VEGF-C positive tubules (Fig. 6), our data suggest tubular
VEGF-C to be involved in the lymphangiogenesis response.
Expression of VEGF-C by Tubular HK-2 Cell Stimulated
with FCS in Dose-dependent Manner
Since we showed tubular activation (osteopontin) and tubular
VEGF-C expression at week 12 in response to prolonged
proteinuria, we decided to test in vitro the capability of tubular
epithelial cells to express and secrete VEGF-C during serum
stimulation. We thus incubated growth arrested HK-2 proximal
tubular epithelial cells with an increasing dose of fetal calf serum.
By qPCR we found a dose-dependent induction of VEGF-C
(Fig. 7A). By ELISA we measured a dose-dependent increase of
VEGF-C in the supernatant, whereas control media in the absence
of cells was completely negative (Fig. 7B). These in vitro
experiments show that proximal tubular epithelial cells are able
to induce VEGF-C mRNA and secrete VEGF-C protein upon
serum stimulation.
Anti-proteinuric Intervention Prevented Tubulo￾interstitial Lymphangiogenesis
To test whether the tubulo-interstitial lymphangiogenic re￾sponse was indeed secondary to proteinuria, in a separate
experiment we treated adriamycin nephrotic rats from week 6 to
week 12 with an ACE-inhibitor lisinopril under low salt diet.
Control adriamycin rats were just on low salt diet from week 6 to
week 12. Interestingly, the lymphangiogenic response seen in the
control adriamycin rats was almost completely blunted upon the
anti-proteinuric treatment by adding the ACE inhibitor (Fig. 8).
Efficacy of the treatment is shown by an almost complete
normalization of urinary protein excretion in the low salt/ACE
inhibitor group. This intervention study clearly shows that an
effective reduction in proteinuria prevented the interstitial
lymphangiogenic response.

Discussion
In this report we show in a unilateral adriamycin model in the
rat that early, established, proteinuria is not associated with
lymphangiogenesis. However, chronic proteinuria by tubular
activation triggers new lymph vessel formation in the kidney,
concomitantly with a pro-fibrotic response and osteopontin
expression, and prior to the development of interstitial fibrosis.
Tubular expression of VEGF-C in close conjunction with newly
formed lymph vessels, together with in vitro tubular cell-derived
VEGF-C production upon serum stimulation, suggest a role for
activated tubular cells in the induction of new lymph vessel
formation, secondary to proteinuria. In line with this, antiprotei￾nuric treatment by ACE inhibition significantly prevented renal
new lymph vessel formation compared to non-treated proteinuric
rats.
Recent studies have shown a considerable heterogeneity in the
expression of endothelial markers of lymphatic vessels in different
physiological and pathologic conditions [26]. Despite this, LYVE￾1 (lymphatic vessel endothelial hyaluronan receptor 1), VEGFR-3
(vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 3), Prox1 (Prospero￾related homeobox transcription factor 1), and Podoplanin are
among the most useful markers for microscopic imaging of lymph
vessel, however, none is an ideal choice. To avoid misleading
interpretation, use of multiple markers for lymph vessel staining
has been proposed [27]. Therefore, we performed an immuno￾fluorescent double-staining protocol using VEGFR-3 and Podo￾planin for visualization of lymphatic endothelium. In the cortex of
normal human and rodent kidneys, lymphatic vessels are restricted
to the peripheral adventitia of large and middle-size arteries and
virtually absent in tubuloinstertitium, whereas rarely observed in
the medulla [20,21]. In our study, lymphatic vessels were indeed
adjacent to arteries in control kidneys, while in proteinuric kidneys
from 12 weeks onwards massive proliferation of lymphatic vessels
was observed especially in cortical tubulointerstitium but not in
medullary region, fully in agreement with the expression of the
lymphangiogenic factors VEGF-C and osteopontin by proximal
tubules in cortical regions.
Proteinuria is associated with the activation of several molecular
pathways which ultimately lead to tubulointerstitial inflammation
and fibrotic interstitial damage [28]. Several in vivo and in vitro
studies consistently have shown that plasma protein-associated
factors can provoke direct tubular activation, and can induce the
synthesis of several cytokines and chemokines, like endothelin-1
(ET-1), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), IL-8 and
RANTES (regulated upon activation normal T-cell expressed and
secreted), which all recruit inflammatory cells to the site of injury
[5,8,29,30]. Of particular interest among them is osteopontin. In
addition to its multi-functional properties, very recently Liersch R.
et al. identified osteopontin as a new lymphangiogenic factor in
melanoma cell line [31]. Although we did not prove this in our
study, it could be very well that OPN plays a role in renal
lymphangiogenesis in our model, which is subject of future studies.
Infiltration of mononuclear cells in the pathogenesis of
progressive renal injury has been well documented. Macrophages
are closely engaged in the production of several cytokines and
growth factors which contribute to ongoing tissue damage [32].
Several other cell types such as dendritic cells, neutrophils, mast
cells and fibroblasts have been shown to secrete major lymphan￾giogenic growth factors, such as VEGF-C and -D, in inflamma￾tion-induced lymphangiogenesis [33,34]. However, the role of
macrophages has been highlighted mostly. Emerging evidence
suggests that macrophages participates in lymphangiogenesis via
two ways: secreting lymphangiogenic growth factors, and
transdifferentiation into lymphatic endothelial cell [35,36]. In
our present study interstitial macrophage numbers increased
significantly by 18 weeks, while at 6 and 12 weeks there was no
prominent infiltration of macrophages as compared to controls.
However, at 12 weeks with no significant increase of macrophage
number, lymph vessel density sharply increased. Also a double
staining for VEGF-C with macrophages (ED-1) showed the large
majority (.95%) of them are not positive for this growth factor,
suggesting that ED-1 positive cells, at least in our model, are not
the main cells for secreting VEGF-C, which is in line with recent
report in unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) model [22]. This
implies that lymphangiogenesis is an early response, before influx
of macrophages and development of inflammation, at least in
renal proteinuric conditions, indicating different mechanism(s) for
new LV formation in this model from well-characterised
inflammation-induced lymphangiogenesis.
Lymphangiogenesis has been also reported in the remnant
kidney model of renal fibrosis in rat [37], and in human renal
biopsies where lymph vessel number was striking in tubulointer￾stitial fibrotic areas [21]. In our experiment, lymphangiogenesis
significantly increased at week 12 without increase in interstitial
collagen I and III deposition. These findings provide strong
evidence that fibrosis and lymphangiogenesis are not always
closely interconnected events, and are more in line with a
profibrotic signalling mechanism in inducing lymphangiogenesis.
Conflicting reports about the relation of lymphangiogenesis,
fibrosis and TGF-b have been published and TGF-b shown as
an inhibitor of lymphatic endothelial cell proliferation [38–40].
Recently in the kidney UUO model, TGF-b has been proved to
induce VEGF-C expression by tubular epithelial cell which
promote lymphangiogenesis [22]. Upregulation of TGF-b1 has
been reported in human Proximal Tubular Epithelial Cells
(PTEC) stimulated by human albumin serum (HAS), however
the amount of TGF-b1 production was dependent on cell line
[41]. Since TGF-b1 is a strong inducer of myofibroblasts, and in
our study interstitial a-SMA positive myofibroblasts followed the
same kinetics as lymph vessel density, we speculate that VEGF-C
induction by TGF-b1 in tubular epithelial cells could be the
mechanism of lymphangiogenesis in our proteinuric model.
However, some other TGF-b1-independent mechanisms, like
osteopontin, could be involved as well.
We did not investigate in detail which urinary proteins could
induce tubular VEGF-C. We showed that plasma proteins (in fetal
calf serum) are able to induce VEGF-C expression. We however
were unable to induce VEGF-C in tubular cells by purified human
albumin (data not shown). In line with this observation, in human
minimal change nephropathy biopsies from patients with a
selective albuminuria, lymph vessel formation was not observed,
whereas in unselective proteinuric glomerulopathies, such as IgA
nephropathy and membranous glomerulopathy, interstitial lymph
vessels were induced [21].We thus speculate that albumin￾unrelated proteins induce VEGF-C in tubular cells. In addition,
the amount of filtered plasma proteins and proteinuria, and the
duration of proteinuria may be important for tubular activation
and induction of VEGF-C, since significant LVs formation was
observed at 12 weeks, when proteinuria had established and
osteopontin, as a marker of tubular activation, increased. It could
be postulated that time and duration of contact between filtered
plasma protein with tubular epithelial cells is an important factor
to activate these cells for VEGF-C production and also for
osteopontin expression. This suggestion is strongly corroborated
by our finding that upon effective intervention on proteinuria,
lymph vessel formation was almost completely prevented.

Although VEGF-C is the best characterized growth factor
inducing lymphangiogenesis, we cannot claim that this growth
factor is the sole lymphangiogenic mediator in our model, as many
other mediators has been shown to be involved in lymphangiogen￾esis. Besides an eventual role for tubular osteopontin, several
growth factors and cytokines are ultrafiltered from plasma into
tubular fluid in proteinuria which normally are restricted from
transglomerular passage [12], and some of them like hepatocyte
growth factor (HGF) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF￾BB), have been reported to have a potential lymphangiogenic
ability [42]. There are other possibilities for the mechanism of
renal lymphangiogenesis by proteinuria. One of the key mecha￾nisms in the pathogenesis of proteinuria-associated injury is
nuclear factor-kB (NF-kB), which upon stimulation evoking several
proinflammatory responses [43]. NF-kB also plays a role in
molecular mechanism of inflammation-induced lymphangiogen￾esis [44], which provides some evidence of underlying possible
mechanism in proteinuria-driven lymphangiogenesis.
Edema in renal interstitium is another consequence of
proteinuria [45]. Disruption of renal lymphatic circulation was
shown experimentally leads to retention of protein and fluid in
interstitium, severe proteinuria, fibrosis and renal cell apoptosis
which caused chronic renal failure [15,46]. On the other hand,
inducing lymphangiogenesis, by using recombinant VEGF-C, has
been reported to profoundly decrease interstitial fluid in experi￾mental lymphedema [47], suggesting a beneficial effect of
provoking lymphangiogenesis in ameliorating tissue edema. In
our main experiment, we used unilateral adriamycin-induced
proteinuric model to largely exclude effects of edema on
lymphangiogenesis. Besides, the unilateral adriamycin approach
prevents development of a uremic condition in the animals,
thereby excluding eventual effects of uremic toxins on lymphan￾giogenesis. In transplantation, some experiments showed that
lymphangiogenesis is detrimental by promoting migration of
antigen-presenting cells (APCs) to the draining lymph node and
initiating immune responses. Blocking lymphangiogenesis in￾creased graft survival and better outcome afterwards, at least in
experimental cardiac, corneal and islet transplantation [48–50]. In
contrast, in experimental chronic and acute skin inflammation
models lymphangiogenesis was beneficial by promoting lymph
flow and reducing edema, suggesting a promising therapeutic
strategy [51,52]. Whether blocking lymphangiogenesis during
proteinuria would have been beneficial effects for interstitial
changes is not investigated in the current study and subject for
further research.
In conclusion, our study for the first time showed that
proteinuria can trigger renal lymphangiogenesis before develop￾ment of interstitial fibrosis. Moreover, our data suggest lymphan￾giogenesis is induced by proteinuria-driven tubular activation,
osteopontin expression and/or VEGF-C synthesis. The degree
and duration of proteinuria seems crucial to activate tubular
epithelial cell for production of osteopontin and VEGF-C. Future
lymphangiostatic intervention studies will reveal the possible
renoprotective effect of targeting lymphangiogenesis in proteinuric
disease and the relation between lymphangiogenesis and develop￾ment of fibrosis.
