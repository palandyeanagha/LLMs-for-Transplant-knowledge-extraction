Conditions in which abnormal or excessive immune responses exist, such as
autoimmune diseases (ADs), graft-versus-host disease, transplant rejection, and
hypersensitivity reactions, are serious hazards to human health and well-being. The
traditional immunosuppressive drugs used to treat these conditions can lead to
decreased immune function, a higher risk of infection, and increased tumor susceptibility.
As an alternative therapeutic approach, cell therapy, in which generally intact and living
cells are injected, grafted, or implanted into a patient, has the potential to overcome the
limitations of traditional drug treatment and to alleviate the symptoms of many refractory
diseases. Cell therapy could be a powerful approach to induce immune tolerance
and restore immune homeostasis with a deeper understanding of immune tolerance
mechanisms and the development of new techniques. The purpose of this review is
to describe the current panoramic scope of cell therapy for immune-mediated disorders,
discuss the advantages and disadvantages of different types of cell therapy, and explore
novel directions and future prospects for these tolerogenic therapies.

IMMUNE HOMEOSTASIS
It is now clear that many factors such as cytokines, immune cells, immune checkpoints,
and microbiota are important in maintaining the immune balance between the external
and internal environment and that they accomplish their function by either promoting or
inhibiting inflammatory responses (1–3). For example, balanced production of pro- and
anti-inflammatory cytokines in response to a foreign configuration results in immunological
equilibrium and defines the immune system in health in contrast to the immunologic imbalance
seen when an overproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines and/or inadequate production of
anti-inflammatory cytokines creates disequilibrium, which represents the immune system in
disease (Figure 1).
A healthy immune system should, therefore, exist in a state of dynamic equilibrium, with
a balance between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory responses, to achieve immune
homeostasis. Ideally, the immune system normally maintains its non-responsiveness to
autoantigens and various harmless environmental entities (allergens, commensal microbiota, etc.)
through complex mechanisms of central and peripheral tolerance. During the course of pathogen
invasion or the appearance of a malignant proliferation of autologous cells, the body needs

FIGURE 1 | Schematic representation of the opposing pro- and anti-inflammatory functions of cytokines in maintaining immunological equilibrium. A balanced
production of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in response to a foreign configuration is one of the mechanisms that contribute to immunological equilibrium (upper
panel). Conversely, immunological imbalance or disease is seen when there is overproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines and/or inadequate production of
anti-inflammatory cytokines (lower panel) (1).
to recognize and generate a targeted and effective immune
response to the abnormality. After successfully eliminating these
deleterious challenges, the immune response normally self￾adjusts and returns to its beneficial state of immune homeostasis.
However, if immune homeostasis is not effectively achieved,
continuous immune hyperactivity or inhibition might contribute
to two types of disease occurrence: autoimmune disease or cancer
(4–7). On the other hand, the hypo-functioning immune system
with deficiencies in immune recognition or effects will increase
the possibility of infection, chronic inflammation, and tumors.
Additionally, abnormal autoimmune responses to autoantigens
might occur if the central tolerance or peripheral tolerance of
the immune system is damaged (Figure 2) (8, 9). As two types
of contrasting immune dysfunction disorders, their different
mechanisms of pathogenesis can serve as a useful reference
for designing counter-treatment strategies (10). For example,
tumor cells are “altered cells” and are generally perceived as
“self ” and non-dangerous, with the privileges of normal healthy
tissues. Treating autoimmune diseases might help to understand
how tumor cells lose these properties, making them target the
immune system, and gain such properties, making them appear
non-dangerous (11).
In addition to autoimmune diseases (ADs), excessive
inflammatory reactions caused by organ transplantation and
hypersensitivity reactions can be life-threatening for patients.
Therefore, restoring immune tolerance to autoantigens or
inducing immune tolerance to specific antigens is of considerable
importance for the clinical treatment of many diseases (12, 13).
Autoimmune responses are associated with imbalances
between effector and inhibitory cells. When a pathological
immune response begins, the effector cells in the tissue
accumulate, eliciting an autoimmune response, which may be
accompanied by a relative decrease in the number of inhibitory
cells or an increased number of dysfunctional inhibitory cells

(14). Imbalances in effector and regulatory cells can lead
to autoimmunity or even tissue damage, and the patients
often experience remission and recurrence due to persistent
interactions between pathogenic responses and regulation (15).
Thus, the development of strategies to eliminate autoimmune
responses and recover the balance of effector and regulatory cells
is becoming an important task for achieving immune tolerance
and disease prevention.
Traditional drugs are often limited in their ability to induce
immune tolerance due to complex immunoregulatory processes
(16). Since cell–cell interactions are fundamental for immune
responses, cell-based therapeutic techniques have developed
rapidly (17, 18) as alternative approaches to traditional drugs.
Cell therapy has become the “hot topic” in cancer research;
in particular, chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cells have
made significant breakthroughs in the treatment of hematologic
malignancies (19, 20). In contrast, cell therapy for ADs has
progressed slowly in recent years. Although cytokine antagonists
have altered the course of many ADs, most current therapeutic
agents target the terminal phase of inflammation and do not
address the fundamental problems that are responsible for the
initiation and progression of the autoimmune process (15).
ADs are often characterized by chronic conditions, which in
most cases require sustained, even life-long treatment, which
imposes a heavy strain and financial burden on patients and
significantly increases their risk of malignant tumors and
infectious complications (21–23). As cell immune therapy
technology can induce immune tolerance through various
immunosuppressive pathways and is expected to achieve long￾term relief of the disease (24–26), it is becoming a promising
technology in the field of immune tolerability.
CELL THERAPY APPROACHES TO ADs
ADs comprise more than 80 different immune disorders
including rheumatoid arthritis (RA), type 1 diabetes (T1DM),
systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), multiple sclerosis (MS),
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), etc., which collectively affect
∼4.5% of the population (27, 28). The consensus is that a mixture
of genetic susceptibility and environmental factors are involved
in the development of autoimmunity. Large-scale genome-wide
association studies (GWASs) and their meta-analyses with a
large sample size have elucidated the disease-susceptible genes
and disease-causing pathways of many ADs (29). However,
potential target autoantigens remain unknown in some of the
most important human ADs, and the precise mechanism of
disease pathogenesis remains elusive (30).
ADs are generally characterized by the presence of
autoreactive immune lymphocytes, leading to intermittent
or sustained inflammation (15). In terms of genetic factors,
typically, polymorphic HLA genes are associated with antigen
presentation pathways, and gene polymorphisms of FOXP3,
immune checkpoints, cytokines, and cytokine receptors are all
related to immune regulation (31–34). In terms of environmental
Frontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org 3 May 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 792

Wang et al. Cell Therapy and Immune Tolerance
factors, smoking and intestinal microbes, among others, have
been implicated in triggering autoimmunity reactions (28, 35–
39). A simple hypothesis that has been put forward to explain
the pathogenesis of autoimmune disease is that polymorphisms
in various genes result in defective regulation or reduced
thresholds for lymphocyte activation, and environmental factors
initiate or augment the activation of self-reactive lymphocytes
that have escaped control and are poised to react against
self-constituents (15). A combination of triggering factors
leads to the diversity of immune disorders, including cellular
immunity, humoral immunity, neuroendocrine networks, and
cytokine networks (21). There are individual differences in
immune disorder indicators among different patients, and the
immune disorder status of the same patient can change as the
AD progresses, presenting a difficult clinical challenge for the
treatment of complex, individualized conditions. These different
modes of pathogenesis combined with different courses of
disease progression are often associated with treatment failure,
particularly when the patients are treated with a single drug
regimen (40).
The occurrence and development of different ADs share the
same common features of lost immune tolerance to autoantigens.
Therefore, the fundamental way to treat the underlying
problem of AD is to restore the patient’s immune tolerance to
autoantigens. The mechanisms through which cells maintain
immune tolerance are diverse, and with the study of cellular
functions and mechanisms, cell-based therapeutic techniques
might provide broader prospects than conventional drugs.
Several cell therapies have been developed and tested to treat
ADs, allograft rejection, and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).
STRATEGY 1: HEMATOPOIETIC STEM
CELL TRANSPLANTATION (HSCT) FOR
IMMUNE RECONSTITUTION
In 1977, Baldwin et al. (41) observed that RA symptoms were
relieved in patients with gold salt-induced aplastic anemia (AA)
following allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. In 1995,
HSCT was clinically applied to severe ADs where conventional
therapy had proved ineffective (42). There were two purposes
for using HSCT: one was to eliminate autoreactive immune
cells, and the other was to rebuild the self-tolerant immune
system. Several clinical trials showed that autologous HSCT
was superior to conventional treatments for the treatment
of severe ADs, including multiple sclerosis and systemic
sclerosis (43–46), and induces long-term disease remission
without immunosuppressive drugs. However, some patients still
experienced AD recurrence after transplantation (42, 47).
Most hematopoietic stem cells currently used to treat AD
have been autologous using either an infusion of unpurified
lymphocytes or immunopurified CD34+ HSCs. For several
refractory ADs, autologous HSCT can be an effective treatment
that induces long-term, drug-free, and asymptomatic remission
(42). However, HSCT is still a high-risk treatment, with the
occurrence of transplant failure, recurrence of disease, infection,
and other complications that might decrease the survival rate
of patients. Therefore, HSCT is only considered suitable for
patients with serious disease and risk of death. It should be
noted that incomplete eradication of autoreactive memory cells
or the infusion of unpurified lymphocytes could cause disease
recurrence. Encouragingly, a method for long-term ex vivo
HSC expansion has been developed recently (48) that might
make homogeneous HSCT easier. Moreover, some patients
might develop disease flares resulting from the re-induction of
autoimmunity driven by genetic predisposition, and allogeneic
HSCT could be used as an alternative therapy (49). The further
development of more effective and safer HSCT methods remains
the next challenge in cell therapy so that this approach can be
used more widely in the future for patients with ADs.
STRATEGY 2: ADOPTIVE
IMMUNOTHERAPY TO ELIMINATE
AUTOREACTIVE IMMUNE CELLS
Autoimmunity is characterized by the presence of autoantibodies
and autoreactive T cells directed against normal components
of an individual. T-cell vaccination (TCV) therapy is a type of
autologous, personalized cell-based therapy in which attenuated
autoreactive T cells are administered as immunogenic agents
and targeted T-cells are deleted or inactivated (Figure 3A).
The concept of TCV was first raised by Ben-nun et al.
(50, 51) in 1981, based on the finding that irradiated T
lymphocyte cells reactive against myelin basic protein (MBP)
can induce a vaccination against experimental autoimmune
encephalomyelitis (EAE). Vaccination with the attenuated anti￾MBP T cells led to resistance to later attempts to induce EAE
by active immunization to MBP in adjuvant (52). Subsequent
research on the mechanisms of TCV has revealed a complicated
anti-idiotypic and anti-ergotypic network to be responsible
for the pathogenic procedure (53, 54). The subject responds
to own vaccine T cells by activating regulatory networks of
T cells, which, in turn, arrests the damaging inflammation
that causes the autoimmune disease (55, 56). Over the past
decades, the effect of TCV has been justified in several
animal models of autoimmune diseases and graft rejection,
including experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, lupus,
autoimmune uveoretinitis, autoimmune diabetes, autoimmune
thyroiditis, collagen-induced arthritis (CIA), and so on (57–62).
Moreover, TCV has shown safety and effectiveness in various
clinical trials, mostly for patients with MS but also for RA, SLE,
and ALS (63–66). Achiron et al. (67) evaluated the efficacy of
TCV therapy for 20 patients with aggressive relapsing-remitting
MS. TCV treatment had a favorable impact on both annual
relapse rate and progression to disability. Seledtsova et al. (68)
conducted a study where 39 patients with progressive (chronic)
MS were multiply immunized with autological polyclonal TCVs.
In the TCV-treated patients, sustained reduction in plasma
IFN-γ levels and concomitant increases in IL-4 levels were
documented. Indeed, polyclonal T-cell vaccination led to a
considerable reduction of proliferative responses of T cells
to myelin-associated antigens. Huang et al. (66) enrolled 16
patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). They found

that TCV was associated with remissions in clinical symptoms,
reductions in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity
Index (SLEDAI) and anti-ds-DNA antibodies, and increases in
complement component 3 (C3) and C4. In addition, it is helpful
in lowering the glucocorticoid doses of patients’ regular usage.
Unfortunately, TCV has been somewhat ignored in the past
due to standard pharmaceutical avoidance of cell-based and
individualized treatments. Nonetheless, cell therapy appears to be
coming of age, and TCV has been granted fast-track status by the
FDA for the treatment of some types of multiple sclerosis (10).
The presence of autoantibodies is a feature of many ADs and
has been widely used to aid the diagnosis of such diseases. B
cell/plasma cells have been recognized as an important target
for the treatment of some ADs (69). Several drugs that target
B cells are in clinical use or are currently being developed,
including monoclonal antibodies to target CD19, CD20, and
CD22, which are expected to effectively treat various ADs
(69). Rituximab depletes B cells by complement-dependent
cytotoxicity (CDC) and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity
(ADCC) effects. This drug is now approved for the treatment
of RA, granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), and microscopic
polyangiitis (MPA), as well as several systemic inflammatory
autoimmune diseases (SIADs) (70, 71). However, such antibody
therapy requires repeated administration, and drug resistance
can occur during long-term administration (72).
The CAR-T has been a major breakthrough for the treatment
of B cell malignancies, and these CAR-T cells can eliminate
B cells in vivo for an extended period of time (73). It has
been reported that the CD19-targeted CAR-T cells persistently
depleted CD19+ B cells, eliminated autoantibody production and
extended life spans in a mouse lupus model (74). However, as
normal B cells can also be being killed by CAR-T cells targeting
B-lineage antigens, this significantly impairs the body’s ability to
fight disease, resulting in the requirement of immunoglobulin
injections to continuously maintain immunity. Therefore, it
might not be practical to treat autoimmune diseases using CAR-T
to clear B-lineage lymphocytes. To circumvent this problem, the
chimeric autoantibody receptor (CAAR) has been constructed
Frontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org 5 May 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 792

Wang et al. Cell Therapy and Immune Tolerance
based on autoantigens, this is capable of binding to the BCR
of autoreactive B lymphocytes and therefore has the ability to
specifically eliminate autoantigen-reactive B cells. It was reported
that CAAR-T cells with the extracellular domain desmoglein3
(Dsg3) were able to eliminate Dsg3-specific B cells in preclinical
models of pemphigus vulgaris (PV) (75). Compared to other
B-cell depletion therapies, CAAR technology only removes
autoreactive B cells, avoiding a decline in immunoglobulins
and the opportunistic infections caused by B-cell clearance,
and might provide an effective and universal strategy for the
specific targeting of autoreactive B cells in antibody-mediated
autoimmune disease (Figures 3B,C). However, there are multiple
autoantigens that are attacked by the immune system and
individualized differences in ADs. Therefore, not only the
coverage of disease-associated antigens but also the molecular
weight and spatial epitope of each antigen should be considered
in the design and construction of effective CAARs to treat
such diseases. Recently we observed that the depletion of
PD1+ cells mainly removes autoreactive cells and results in
a therapeutic effect in several animal models of inflammatory
diseases (76), providing an encouraging approach to combat
autoimmune diseases.
STRATEGY 3: REBUILDING AUTOIMMUNE
TOLERANCE USING VARIOUS
IMMUNOREGULATORY CELLS
Antigen-presenting cells (APCs), including dendritic cells
(DCs) and monocytes/macrophages, play an important
role in the regulation of innate and acquired immunity,
as well as bidirectional regulation in both antigen-specific
immunity and immune tolerance. Tolerogenic antigen￾presenting cells (tolAPCs) comprise a specific type of APC with
immunoregulatory functions (77, 78).
Tolerogenic DCs (tolDCs) are a heterogeneous pool
of dendritic cells with immunosuppressive properties. In
autoimmunity, DCs tend to produce pro-inflammatory
cytokines and lead to the activation of autologous antigen￾reactive T cells (79). The DC-induced immune response or
immunotolerance is determined by the maturation state of
DCs, and both immature DCs (iDCs) and semi-mature DCs
have been shown to be tolerogenic (80–84). TolDCs modulate
adaptive immune responses and restore tolerance through
different mechanisms that involve anergy, the generation of
regulatory lymphocyte populations, or the deletion of potentially
harmful inflammatory T cell subsets (Figure 4A) (85–88).
Dhodapkar et al. (80) first reported the ability of tolDCs to
induce antigen-specific immune tolerance in healthy volunteers,
using keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) and influenza matrix
peptide (MP) in combination with iDC injection, which led
to the specific inhibition of MP-specific CD8+T cell effector
function and the appearance of MP-specific interleukin 10-
producing cells. Giannoukakis et al. (81) reported the safety
of tolDCs in adult type 1 diabetic patients. C-peptide levels in
some of the subjects became detectable, whereas prior to and
at the time of enrollment, they were undetectable. Amezaga
et al. (82) reported the treatment of refractory Crohn’s disease
using tolDCs characterized by high levels of IL-10 production
in response to lipopolysaccharide and gram-negative bacteria,
wherein three of the nine patients exhibited improved outcomes,
with an increase in circulating regulatory T cells (Tregs) and
a decrease in IFN-γ. Benham et al. (83) used four different
citrulline peptide-loaded NF-κB inhibitor (BAY11-7082)-
treated tolDCs, “Rheumavax,” for subcutaneous injection to
RA patients. One month post-treatment, patients exhibited
lower DAS28 scores, decreased effector T cells, increased
FOXP3+ Tregs, and reduced serum C reactive protein, IL-15,
IL-29, CX3CL1, and CXCL11, confirming the efficacy and
safety of Rheumavax for the treatment of RA. In a further
demonstration, Bell et al. (84) injected autologous synovial
fluid antigen-loaded tolDCs into the joint cavity to treat
rheumatic and inflammatory arthritis, leading to reduced
inflammation and pain. Researchers have also established
various optimized protocols to maintain the stability of tolDCs
and enhance their lymph node-homing capacity (Table 1).
Several modulating actors, such as dexamethasone and vitamin
A or vitamin D3 were proven to induce DCs with stable
regulatory capacity, whereas partial maturation endows tolDCs
with robust antigen presentation and lymph node-homing
capacity (82, 84, 89).
Unlike autologous tolDCs, donor-derived regulatory
macrophages (Mregs) have also been used to induce allogeneic
tolerance during organ transplantation. Transplant acceptance￾inducing cells (TAICs) are primarily considered a class of
immunoregulatory macrophages (90–92). In the TAIC￾I clinical trial, 12 patients received renal transplants and
corpse donor spleen-derived TAIC treatment (Figure 4B).
An immunosuppressive regimen (including tacrolimus and
sirolimus triple) was used, following TAIC treatment 5 days
post-transplantation. In the majority of patients (10 of 12),
the amount of supporting immunosuppressant was gradually
reduced, whereas eight patients discontinued steroids at 8
weeks, and six of eight patients discontinued sirolimus at 12
weeks; only low-dose tacrolimus maintenance therapy was
required subsequently (91). In the TAIC-II clinical trial, the
investigators co-cultured adherent cells derived from living
donor peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with
suspension cells from the recipient PBMCs to obtain TAICs
for renal transplantation (Figure 4C). Clinically, it was possible
to treat four of five with tacrolimus monotherapy rather than
conventional immunosuppressive regimens, whereas three of five
patients were able to tolerate low-dose tacrolimus monotherapy.
Although the trial failed to demonstrate the effectiveness of
TAICs, treatment was able to eliminate several allogeneic
reactions (92). For example, post-TAIC transplantation, the anti￾donor HLA-specific antibody disappeared and, in some cases,
serum immunoglobulin returned to normal levels, indicating
that TAIC treatment could eliminate donor-HLA-specific
antibodies (90).
In another clinical trial (93), the investigators adjusted the
TAIC-II clinical trial to trace the presence of Mregs in the body.
Mregs were initially trapped in the lung, and thereafter, cells were
detected in circulation after 2.5 h and began to accumulate in the

liver and spleen. After 22 h of Mreg administration, the signal was
markedly reduced in the lung and increased in the liver, spleen,
and hematopoietic active bone marrow. No signal was detected
from the patient’s urinary tract throughout the examination
period, indicating that most infused Mregs remained alive. There
is a risk of pulmonary embolism in cell therapies, and the risk is
theoretically related to the number and size of the cells. However,
human Mregs are larger in volume than other cells used in
cell therapy, having a diameter of ∼15–30µm. As the average
diameter of pulmonary capillaries is 7.5 ± 2.3µm, it is important
to consider the risk of pulmonary embolism associated with Mreg
treatments (94).
Tregs are important regulatory cells that maintain peripheral
immune tolerance (95–98). Claudio et al. (99) first used cultured
cord blood polyclonal Tregs to treat acute GVHD (aGVHD),
and 23 patients treated with Tregs exhibited a lower incidence

of grade II-IV aGVHD compared to that in 108 historical
controls (43 vs. 61%, P = 0.05); this was associated with no
toxicity after infusion and no detrimental effects of infection or
instances of relapse or early death. Mauro et al. (100) evaluated
the effects of GVHD prevention and immune reconstitution
through the early infusion of freshly isolated Tregs for 28
high-risk hematologic malignancy patients treated with HLA￾haploidentical HSCT. Their findings indicated that the adoptive
transfer of Tregs prevented GVHD in the absence of any
post-transplantation immunosuppression, promoted lymphoid
reconstitution, improved immunity to opportunistic pathogens,
and did not diminish the graft-versus-leukemia effect. Natalia
et al. (101) treated 12 children with type 1 diabetes (T1D) with
autologous expanded Tregs. After transfusion, the number of
Tregs in peripheral blood increased, and no serious side effects
were observed. Most patients exhibited increased C-peptide
levels and lower demand for insulin, whereas two patients
were completely insulin-independent at 1 year. In another
study, similar results were observed in adult subjects (102).
However, a phase II clinical trial (NCT02691247) showed that
autologous ex vivo polyclonally expanded Treg infusion failed
to preserve C-peptide production 1 year after the start of
treatment in 113 newly diagnosed adolescents with T1D (103).
One major problem is that transferring a large number of Tregs
of broad undefined specificity can potentially suppress protective
immunity against tumors and infectious diseases (104). Evidence
from animal models of Treg therapy has clearly shown that
antigen-specific Tregs are vastly superior to polyclonal Tregs,
meaning that fewer cells are needed for the desired therapeutic
effect (105).
In recent years, studies of Tregs engineered with chimeric
antigen receptors (CAR-Tregs) have made great progress
in optimizing anti-inflammatory and immune-tolerogenic
responses (104, 106, 107). There are several examples of this as
follows. (i) Elinav et al. (108) constructed a CAR-Treg specific for
2,4,6-trinitrophenol and demonstrated the CAR-Treg-specific
effect pattern in different colitis mouse models. (ii) Fransson et al.
(109) constructed CAR-Treg targeting myelin oligodendrocyte
glycoproteins, which exerted a continual inhibitory effect for
the treatment of EAE in mice. (iii) Dan et al. (110) constructed
CAR-Tregs to target carcinoembryonic antigen to treat colitis
in mice and found that CAR-Tregs can accumulate at the
inflammation site in mice and inhibit colitis development. (iv)
MacDonald et al. (111) constructed an HLA-A2-specific CAR
(A2-CAR) and showed the inhibition of GVHD caused by
HLA-A2+ T cells. (v) Boardman et al. (112) and Noyan et al.
(113) also demonstrated that A2-CAR-Tregs could completely
prevent allogeneic transplant rejection without using other
immunosuppressant intervention in humanized mice. (iv) Yoon
et al. (114) constructed CAR-Tregs targeting factor FVIII, which
effectively inhibited T cell and B cell responses to FVIII. These
results showed that specifically designed CAR-Tregs can induce
immune tolerance not only by targeting cell surface proteins but
also by targeting secretory proteins (Figure 5). In conclusion,
CAR-Tregs display the hallmarks of cell therapy, including being
target-specific, long-lasting, chemotaxic, and highly efficient for
broad application in the treatment of ADs, graft-versus-host
diseases, and transplant rejection. We believe that CAR-Tregs
will be the next frontier in the development of anti-inflammatory
and tolerogenic therapies.
Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), widely distributed in
various connective tissues, have multi-directional differentiation
potential and strong immune regulation and tissue repair
functions. Therefore, MSCs naturally play a role in modulating
ADs, organ transplantation, and GVHD. MSC-related clinical
trials include the treatment of diabetes, RA, Behcet’s disease,
organ transplantation, systemic lupus erythematosus, and others
(115–119). Among them, it has been shown that MSC infusion
promotes implantation in HSCT, reduces the incidence of
chronic GVHD, and also plays an important role in the treatment
of aGVHD (120–123). In a meta-analysis of over 200 patients to
evaluate the efficacy of locally injected MSCs as a treatment for

Wang et al. Cell Therapy and Immune Tolerance
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), more than half of patients
displayed complete remission, and more than two-thirds of
patients showed positive treatment responses, indicating that
MSCs have considerable potential for IBD treatment (124).
However, the majority of MSC-based trials for ADs are still in
early phases I or II. Some have promising results and no reported
toxicity to date, but phase III studies will be needed to confirm
their efficacy (125, 126).
MSC sources currently used for clinical trials include bone
marrow, perinatal tissue, dental pulp, and adipose tissue
(127–132). Differences associated with tissue source, such as
donor-related variability, cell culture system, passage number,
and reagent formulation, might be important factors for the
biological characteristics of MSC. These characteristics mainly
include the homing ability of MSCs, viability in vivo, and
immunosuppressive ability, which exert important influences on
the therapeutic effect of tolerability. Intravenous injection is one
of the most commonly used infusion methods for MSCs, which
can play a systemic regulatory role. Whether MSCs can home
to the site of inflammation is an important factor influencing
their therapeutic effect, as these cells require interactions between
tissue-specific chemokines and the corresponding receptors. In
a mouse model of contact hypersensitivity (CHS), CXCR5-
overexpressing MSCs show significantly increased migration
ability toward CXCL13, which is highly upregulated in
inflamed ears of CHS mice (133). Under certain pathological
conditions, ischemic or inflammatory environments might be
detrimental to the survival of MSCs. Researchers have used
some proinflammatory cytokine pretreatments, such as IFN-γ,
TNF-α, and IL-17, among others, to promote MSC expression
of IDO and NO, which increases their immunosuppressive
abilities (18, 134–138).
CONCLUSION AND PERSPECTIVES
Most immunoregulatory cells exhibit issues regarding
survivability, stability, plasticity, and homing capacity. Cells
for tolerogenic treatment can be derived from an autologous
or allogeneic source. Further, the fact that autologous cells
might contain gene-related defects, resulting in less effective
tolerogenic therapy, cannot be ignored. Whereas, the short
survival period of allogeneic cells, because of rejection, might
lead to poor treatment efficacy, the prolonged persistence of
allogeneic cells will raise safety concerns. After infusion, the
avoidance of the transformation of immunoregulatory cells
into effector cells is essential for the long-term efficacy of
tolerogenic therapy. In particular, if the regulatory cells used
for targeted cell therapy (e.g., CAR-Treg) are unstable and
transform into inflammatory cells, they might exert an adverse
effect on the disease. For treatment with Tregs, the memory
Tregs induce a stronger inflammatory response than naïve Tregs
(139). Therefore, not only the choice between autologous or
allogeneic cells, as well as the cell type, needs to be considered,
but also the stable subpopulation of cells for treatment should
be considered.
Genetically modified immune cell therapy technology, such
as CAR-Treg, could present a breakthrough for the treatment of
ADs. Genetic modification can compensate for genetic defects
to a certain extent and has advantages for therapeutic cell
targeting, chemotaxis, and enhancement. Similarly, the safety
of gene therapy should be carefully considered, including
genetically modifying vectors, the recombination of internal and
exogenous genes, the controllability of gene expression, and even
ethical issues.
In addition, we propose two directions: immortalized cell
lines and cell-like materials. Immortalized NK92 cells have
been used to treat malignant tumors in several clinical trials
(140). Immortalized cell lines can be mass-produced, and
the product quality is easier to control. To date, there
have been no studies using immortal cells for immune
tolerance therapy. With the development of genetic modification
technology, the immortalized cell line can be genetically
engineered to express a certain level of death ligands/inhibitory
checkpoint molecules/membrane-bound inhibitory cytokines or
ectoenzymes to exert potent immunosuppressive effects under
targeted conditions. Gamma-ray treatment of immortalized cells
can induce a loss of proliferative ability while maintaining
biological activity for a short period of time. Functions of
regulatory cells such as Tregs do not depend on self-proliferation,
and apoptotic Tregs display stronger immunosuppressive effects
(141). The function of inflammatory cells might be inhibited
and immunosuppressive cell functions can be enhanced by
contact with artificial immortalized cells, thereby achieving
the induction of immune tolerance. Therefore, immortalized
cells might serve as an alternative choice for tolerogenic cell
therapy (Figure 6).
As the mechanism through which various inhibitory cytokines
or ligands exert immunosuppressive effects are being gradually
discovered, one effective strategy might be the construction of
cell-like particles based on the immune checkpoints of these
known mechanisms. Some researchers have studied tolerogenic
therapies using nanomaterials (142–144). Cell-like materials with
individualized and regulated functions could be synthesized
through biochemical methods, which can induce the apoptosis
of autoreactive immune cells, thereby achieving the recovery of
immune tolerance.
In conclusion, there are still many problems to be solved
regarding current tolerogenic cell therapy technology. However,
accumulating evidence indicates that cell-based tolerogenic
treatment will undoubtedly play an important role in future
medical technology.
