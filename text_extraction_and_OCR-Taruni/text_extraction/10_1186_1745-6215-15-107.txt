Abstract
Background: Despite major advances in transplant medicine, improvements in long-term kidney allograft survival
have not been commensurate with those observed shortly after transplantation. The formation of donor-specific
antibodies (DSA) and ongoing antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) processes may critically contribute to late graft
loss. However, appropriate treatment for late AMR has not yet been defined. There is accumulating evidence that
the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib may substantially affect the function and integrity of alloantibody-secreting
plasma cells. The impact of this agent on the course of late AMR has not so far been systematically investigated.
Methods/design: The BORTEJECT Study is a randomized controlled trial designed to clarify the impact of
intravenous bortezomib on the course of late AMR. In this single-center study (nephrological outpatient service,
Medical University Vienna) we plan an initial cross-sectional DSA screening of 1,000 kidney transplant recipients
(functioning graft at ≥180 days; estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) >20 ml/minute/1.73 m2
). DSA-positive
recipients will be subjected to kidney allograft biopsy to detect morphological features consistent with AMR.
Forty-four patients with biopsy-proven AMR will then be included in a double-blind placebo-controlled intervention
trial (1:1 randomization stratified for eGFR and the presence of T-cell-mediated rejection). Patients in the active group
will receive two cycles of bortezomib (4 × 1.3 mg/m2 over 2 weeks; 3-month interval between cycles). The primary end
point will be the course of eGFR over 24 months (intention-to-treat analysis). The sample size was calculated according
to the assumption of a 5 ml/minute/1.73 m2 difference in eGFR slope (per year) between the two groups (alpha: 0.05;
power: 0.8). Secondary endpoints will be DSA levels, protein excretion, measured glomerular filtration rate, transplant
and patient survival, and the development of acute and chronic morphological lesions in 24-month protocol biopsies.
Discussion: The impact of anti-humoral treatment on the course of late AMR has not yet been systematically
investigated. Based on the hypothesis that proteasome inhibition improves the outcome of DSA-positive late
AMR, we suggest that our trial has the potential to provide solid evidence towards the treatment of this type
of rejection.

Background
Despite major advances in transplant medicine, which
include continuous refinements of immunosuppressive
strategies, large registry analyses have failed to demon￾strate major improvements in long-term survival of
standard kidney transplants over the last decades [1,2].
Recent studies have underscored a dominant role of
alloimmune injury as a leading cause of long-term graft
loss. In this respect, the formation of antibodies against
polymorphic donor antigens, commonly human leukocyte
antigens (HLA), has proved to be an important trigger of
graft rejection [3-5]. Humoral rejection (antibody-medi￾ated rejection (AMR)) of organ transplants has been
established to constitute a separate rejection entity, and in
recent years accurate biopsy-based and serological criteria
for this rejection type have been defined to provide a solid
basis for targeted treatment: microcirculation inflamma￾tion and injury; antibody-triggered C4 complement split
product deposition (C4d) along peritubular capillaries;
and detection of circulating donor-specific antibodies
[6,7]. It has become evident that a considerable proportion
of recipients develop features of AMR late after trans￾plantation, a process culminating in chronic irreversible
tissue damage, graft dysfunction and loss [8-10]. Indeed,
there are studies suggesting that newly formed donor￾specific antibodies (DSA) represent the primary cause of
late graft loss [11-15].
Treatment of AMR is a big challenge. For early acute
AMR, various treatment protocols – which include anti￾body depletion by apheresis, modulation of B-cell immun￾ity by intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), or targeting
critical components of innate immunity including comple￾ment activation – were shown to potentially prevent and
reverse rejection [5,16-18].
For late AMR, however, appropriate treatment still re￾mains to be established. A few anecdotal reports and
small case series have suggested efficacy of distinct anti￾humoral treatment modalities. While uncontrolled studies
have suggested stabilization of chronic AMR following
treatment with high-dose IVIG and CD20 antibody ri￾tuximab, at least in some patients [19-22], other reports
have shown that such treatment may not be sufficient to
prevent the development of AMR and subsequent chronic
injury [23]. A major drawback of currently available treat￾ment strategies may be that they do not directly affect the
integrity and function of long-lived alloantibody-producing
plasma cells [24].
One attractive treatment concept could be the target￾ing of alloantibody-producing plasma cells. In this con￾text, the use of bortezomib, a proteasome inhibitor
approved for the treatment of multiple myeloma, may be
a promising option. There is now increasing evidence
that proteasome inhibition could affect nonmalignant
autoantibody or alloantibody-secreting cells [25-27]. In
recent years, numerous case series and anecdotal reports
have suggested efficacy of bortezomib treatment (com￾monly part of multimodal treatment strategies) in redu￾cing levels of DSA, improving kidney function and
preventing graft loss in patients experiencing acute AMR
[28-30]. However, there are only scarce data on the effi￾cacy of bortezomib in treating late AMR processes. There
are recent experimental and preliminary clinical data sug￾gesting a potential impact of bortezomib also on the
course of late AMR [30-33]. In a recently published case
of late chronic active AMR with a slow progressive deteri￾oration of kidney function and increasing proteinuria,
our study group could also demonstrate a profound
downregulation of DSA and a complete abrogation of
biopsy-proven antibody-triggered intragraft comple￾ment activation following a single cycle of bortezomib
[32]. Remarkably, bortezomib treatment was associated
with a consistent decrease in proteinuria and stabilization
of graft function. As expected, advanced chronic lesions
(severe transplant glomerulopathy) in this patient remained
unchanged [32]. Such promising results as well a recent ex￾perimental model [31] provided a valuable basis for the de￾sign of a systematic intervention trial.
Methods/design
Trial design
The BORTEJECT Study is an investigator-driven ran￾domized, placebo-controlled single-center trial (phase II)
designed to examine the efficiency of the proteasome in￾hibitor bortezomib in the treatment of late AMR. We
hypothesize that, by inhibiting alloantibody production,
bortezomib is able to halt the progression of ongoing
graft injury and dysfunction caused by antibody-triggered
rejection processes. The study will be performed in two
major steps. The first step (Part A) consists of a cross￾sectional screening analysis of a large cohort of kidney
transplant recipients for the presence of late AMR. In a
second step (Part B), 44 rejecting recipients will be ran￾domized in a controlled intervention trial. The proposed
duration of the trial is 36 months.
Part A
We plan a cross-sectional screening of approximately
1,000 kidney transplant recipients for the presence of
circulating DSA and morphological features of AMR. All
patients will be recruited at the outpatient service of the
Division of Nephrology and Dialysis, Medical University
Vienna. Inclusion and exclusion criteria for this first part
of the study are listed in Table 1. Key inclusion criteria
are a functioning graft at ≥180 days post transplantation
and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) >20 ml/
minute/1.73 m2
. The glomerular filtration rate (GFR)
threshold was chosen to avoid inclusion of transplants
with an extensive degree of irreversible chronic damage.

We anticipate that approximately 90% of screened recip￾ients will be eligible for serological screening. In at least
10% (n ≥ 90) of the HLA antibody-tested patients a posi￾tive DSA result can be expected [13]. We estimated
biopsy-based AMR features (see Table 2) to occur in at
least 60% of the DSA-positive subjects [34]. Hence, our
screening can be expected to identify approximately 50
patients eligible for inclusion in the interventional trial
(Part B). A flowchart of study Part A is provided in
Figure 1.
Part B
The second part of the study is a randomized controlled
interventional trial designed to include 44 transplant re￾cipients with late AMR. A flowchart is shown in Figure 2.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria are provided in Table 3.
Key inclusion criteria are the detection of HLA class I
and/or class II DSA and the presence of one or more
morphological and/or immunohistochemical features of
AMR in the index biopsy.
Randomization
Patients will be randomized by computer assignment at
a ratio of 1:1 for the two treatment groups (bortezomib

versus placebo) using an online randomization tool
[35]. To avoid unbalances in baseline variables that po￾tentially affect treatment responses, randomization will
be stratified according to eGFR (>50 ml/minute/1.73 m2
vs. <50 ml/minute/1.73 m2
) and the presence or absence
of T-cell-mediated rejection (no rejection or borderline le￾sion vs. Banff I rejection).
Interventions
Study interventions will be carried out in a double￾blinded fashion. We have included the option of a rescue
unblinding in case of emergencies.
Patients allocated to the intervention group will re￾ceive two cycles of bortezomib at 3-month intervals.
Each cycle will consist of bortezomib 1.3 mg/m2 admin￾istered twice weekly on days 1, 4, 8 and 11. Bortezomib
will be injected intravenously and all bortezomib-treated
patients will receive oral antiviral prophylaxis to prevent
the development of viral infection, particularly herpes
zoster infection. Valacyclovir (500 mg/day; patients with
eGFR <30 ml/minute/1.73 m2
, 250 mg/day) will be pre￾scribed for 3 weeks after initiation of each bortezomib
cycle. Patients allocated to the control group will receive
placebo instead of bortezomib (0.9% sodium chloride so￾lution) or valacyclovir (hard gelatine capsules filled with
maltodextrine), respectively.
According to our center standard, all included sub￾jects on therapy with a calcineurin inhibitor (tacroli￾mus or cyclosporine A) or a mammalian target of
rapamycin inhibitor (everolimus or rapamycin), with￾out azathioprine or mycophenolate mofetil, will receive
mycophenolate mofetil (initially 2 × 500 mg/day; in the
absence of gastrointestinal side effects and significant
leukopenia or thrombocytopenia, there will be a step￾wise increase of dose to 2 × 1,000 mg/day) to avoid
underimmunosuppression. Recipients weaned off ste￾roids will receive low-dose prednisolone (initiation
with 10 mg/day, tapered to 5 mg/day within 4 weeks).
Outcome parameters
The primary endpoint will be the course of calculated
GFR (slope) over 2 years. As detailed in Table 4, second￾ary study endpoints include the course of human
leukocyte antigen antibody levels, measured GFR and
protein excretion, graft and patient survival, occurrence
of acute rejection necessitating treatment, and acute and
chronic AMR scores in protocol biopsies performed at
24 months.
Sample size
For sample size calculation, we re-analyzed a large retro￾spective transplant cohort (transplantation and follow-up
at the Medical University Vienna; inclusion criteria for
analysis: eGFR >20 ml/minute/1.73 m2 at 4 years post
transplantation, complete follow-up for another 4 years).
Evaluating the impact of late (>180 days) C4d-positive
AMR on the clinical performance of kidney allografts, we
observed a GFR slope of −8.2 ml/year (over a follow-up of
6 years), as compared with a slope of −1.8 ml/minute/year
in nonbiopsied and −2.8 ml/minute/year in biopsied C4d￾negative subjects (Figure 3). Pilot studies using data from
the Austrian Dialysis and Transplant Registry were con￾ducted to estimate the eGFR decline and the variance of
sequential eGFR determinations. When using only one
eGFR determination at 2 years as the primary endpoint,

analyses showed an impracticable high sample size num￾ber under the assumption of a median treatment effect of
bortezomib (standard deviation 0.5). The difference in
slope of half-yearly determined eGFR between the two
treatment groups will therefore be used as the quantitative
outcomes measure. Mixed linear models for longitudinal
data were used for analyses. Power calculation using an
autoregressive covariance matrix of the first order with a
correlation of 0.9, an alpha value of 0.05 for the interaction
term of treatment and time, and an attrition of 8% per
year showed that 2 × 22 subjects would be required to un￾cover a difference in eGFR slopes of 5 ml/minute/year
with a power of 80% (Figure 4).
Data safety monitoring board
This study will be monitored by an independent data
and safety monitoring board of the Medical University
Vienna. Interim analyses will be performed by the data
and safety monitoring board after completion of 10 cases
and 20 cases in each treatment group. The Lan and
DeMets extension of the O’Brien-Fleming stopping rules
will be applied [36] and the trial will be stopped if ob￾served P <0.00001 (first interim analysis) or observed
P <0.00305 (second interim analysis) occurs.
Quality control and quality assurance
Monitoring procedures, which will include predefined
regular visits at the study site, will be carried out by a
study monitor. Throughout the study, the investigator
will grant access to all source documents including case
report forms and other protocol-related documents.
Subject confidentiality will be maintained in agreement
with local regulations. The monitor will inspect the
case report forms at serial intervals following a defined
monitoring plan, in order to verify adherence and
completeness of the protocol as well as the validity and
accuracy of entered data. His responsibility also in￾cludes the verification for the presence of informed
consent, adherence to the inclusion/exclusion criteria,
documentation of severe adverse events and the re￾cording of the main efficacy, safety, and tolerability
endpoints. The investigator will resolve discrepancies
of data, and upon request he will make all study￾related source data and records available to a qualified
quality assurance auditor mandated by the sponsor or
in the form of competent authority inspectors.
Safety evaluation and reporting of adverse events
The investigator ensures that adequate medical care is
provided in any clinical situation, including emergencies.
Safety evaluation includes a careful monitoring of all ad￾verse events, including serious adverse events. As de￾fined by the International Conference on Harmonization
guidelines and World Health Organization Good Clinical
Practice guidelines, serious adverse events are events that
result in patient death, are life-threatening, require or pro￾long hospital stay, cause persistent or significant disability
or incapacity, result in congenital anomaly or birth defect,
or necessitate specific interventions.
The most probable and usually transient adverse
events caused by bortezomib are mild to moderate
thrombocytopenia and leukocytopenia, decreased appetite,

gastrointestinal side effects (vomiting, nausea, diarrhea),
fatigue, peripheral neuropathy and other neurological
symptoms, such as headache, dizziness, or tremor. In￾tensified immunosuppression may be associated with
an increased infection risk (herpes zoster, herpes sim￾plex, pneumonia, bronchitis, sinusitis, nasopharyngi￾tis). A careful patient follow-up will therefore include a
complete neurological status awareness of any sign of
infection (bacterial, viral and/or fungal).
The most probable adverse events caused by valacyclo￾vir are headache, fever, nausea, gastrointestinal side effects
(vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain), dizziness, hallucin￾ation, confusion, changes in blood cell counts (leukopenia,
thrombocytopenia, anemia) and increased liver and/or
kidney parameters.
Methodology
Human leukocyte antigen antibody detection
Sera will be prescreened for anti-HLA IgG using
LabScreenMixed assays (One Lambda, Canoga Park, CA,
USA). For identification of HLA antigen/allele specificities,
prescreen-positive samples will be subjected to single￾antigen flow-bead testing (LABscreen Single Antigen
assays; One Lambda). Test results will be documented as
mean fluorescence intensities, and mean fluorescence in￾tensity >1,000 will be considered positive. Donor-specificity
will be defined according to donor and recipient HLA typ￾ing results.
Transplant biopsies
Index and 24-month protocol biopsies will be performed
after exclusion of a coagulation disorder or thrombocyte
counts below 80%. Anticoagulants or inhibitors of thrombo￾cyte aggregation will be transiently paused in the context of
biopsy. The biopsy will be performed under local anesthesia
using ultrasound-guided percutaneous techniques (two
cores per biopsy, 16 G needle). After biopsy, patients will be
monitored closely for at least 6 hours for any complications
(serial blood pressure measurements, monitoring for
hematuria, control of blood picture 4 hours after bi￾opsy). Biopsies will be evaluated on standard paraffin￾embedded sections including immunohistochemical
C4d staining. In addition, biopsy samples will be evalu￾ated by electron microscopy.
Assessment of kidney function
The eGFR will be calculated using the Mayo equation
[37]. For kidney transplants, this equation was reported
to be superior with respect to estimations of GFR slopes
[38]. The chromium ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid
GFR will be assessed by measuring the clearance of
chromium-51 ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid according
to a standard protocol.
Statistical methods
All analyses will be conducted according to the intention￾to-treat principle. Continuous data will be analyzed by
t test, and categorical data by a chi-square test or
Fisher’s exact test when appropriate. We will perform
stratification for both treatment groups (baseline eGFR
and T-cell-mediated rejection, Banff grade I) during ana￾lysis of the serum creatinine trajectories using a mixed lin￾ear model with time and therapy as the independent
parameters. The most applicable covariance matrices will
be determined by graphical analysis and evaluated by the
log-likelihood ratio. Data missing at random are expected
to account for less than 5% of parameters and will be ad￾dressed by multiple imputation. Sensitivity analyses will be
performed to test the violation of the missing at random
assumption. For all analysis, SAS for Windows 9.2 (The
SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA) will be used.
Ethical issues
The BORTEJECT Study will be conducted in accordance
with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki 2008. In￾stitutional ethics committee approval (EK1515/2012) was
obtained for all aspects of the study. All study participants
will be asked to sign the written informed consent in
order to participate in the study (patient insurance in￾cluded). We will adhere to all the trial-related require￾ments, good clinical practice requirements (International
Conference on Harmonization Good Clinical Practice),
good laboratory practice and the applicable regulatory
requirements.
Study registration
The study was approved by the Austrian regulatory au￾thority (Federal Office for Safety in Health Care, Austrian
Agency for Health and Food Safety, AGES reference
number: LCM-717840-0001) and was registered in the
European Clinical Trials Database (EudraCT number:
2012-002857-41) and in a public clinical trial database
(ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01873157).
Discussion
The prevention and treatment of late AMR represents a
major challenge in transplant medicine. In the last dec￾ade, ongoing humoral rejection has been recognized as
one of the cardinal causes of long-term kidney allograft
dysfunction and loss [11-15]. The diagnosis of AMR has
been refined by the establishment of clear-cut diagnostic
morphologic and immunohistologic criteria [6,7] and the
implementation of innovative techniques allowing for
the precise detection and characterization of deleterious
HLA reactivity patterns [39]. Nevertheless, there is still a
need for efficient therapeutic strategies to counteract the
development of irreversible graft damage triggered by
humoral alloresponses. The establishment of efficient
Eskandary et al. Trials 2014, 15:107 Page 6 of 9

protocols for the treatment of chronic rejection would have
a major impact on standard clinical care in organ trans￾plantation and would probably improve graft survival in a
considerable proportion of transplant recipients. However,
up to now, no systematic trial to prove clinical efficiency of
targeted anti-humoral therapy has been reported.
In the last years, uncontrolled studies have suggested a
beneficial effect of distinct treatment approaches on the
course of late AMR. Very recently, Billing and colleagues
reported on a cohort of 20 pediatric kidney transplant
recipients who were diagnosed as having C4d-positive
chronic AMR [22]. In support of smaller previous series
[20,21], combined treatment with high-dose IVIG and
CD20 antibody rituximab stabilized kidney function and
led to a decrease in DSA levels at least in some of the
treated patients. Even though a few recipients lost their
graft during follow-up, longitudinal analysis of kidney
function showed an amelioration of the decline in GFR,
particularly in patients with a lesser degree of chronic
injury. Major caveats of this and of other studies, how￾ever, are an uncontrolled design and the lack of a non￾treated control group, respectively [22].
While IVIG and rituximab as well as other treatments
may not target long-lived antibody-producing plasma
cells [24], the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib was
shown to directly affect the function and integrity of
nonmalignant plasma cells [25-27], and may therefore
be a promising approach to halt the progression of
antibody-mediated graft damage. This agent was shown
to directly block HLA antibody production in the con￾text of acute AMR [27], and numerous case reports and
uncontrolled studies have pointed to efficiency of this
approach in the treatment of acute rejection [28-30].
Such promising preliminary data and a recently pub￾lished case of chronic AMR showing partial responses to
bortezomib treatment, including DSA reduction and loss
of C4d staining along transplant capillaries [32], have
now prompted us to plan a systematic trial designed to
analyze the concept of proteasome inhibition.
Applying a randomized placebo-controlled double￾blind design, our single-center trial has the potential to
definitely clarify the impact of bortezomib on the course
of late AMR after kidney transplantation. A major point
is that the trial is investigator initiated and is therefore
free from any commercial bias.
Considering earlier reported rates of DSA positivity in
long-term transplant recipients [13], the chosen ap￾proach of a cross-sectional screening of a large number
of patients followed at our outpatient facility can be ex￾pected to allow for the recruitment of a sufficient num￾ber of patients fulfilling the criteria for randomization in
the intervention trial.
To avoid imbalances between study groups, randomization
will be stratified for kidney function at the time of
randomization and the presence or absence of T-cell￾mediated rejection in index biopsies. Stratification for
kidney function (GFR <50 ml/minute/1.73 m2 vs. >50 ml/
minute/1.73 m2
) was chosen to account for expected in￾terindividual variability regarding the extent of chronic
transplant injury (for example, transplant glomerulopathy,
chronic vasculopathy or interstitial fibrosis/tubular atro￾phy). Indeed, one may argue that an irreversibility of
chronic injury may critically influence the responsiveness
to specific treatment. Similarly, intergroup differences
with respect to the proportions of study patients with
acute T-cellular rejection could substantially influence trial
outcomes.
We have chosen the slope of GFR over 24-month
follow-up as the primary endpoint. Using kidney func￾tion as a surrogate parameter of long-term allograft sur￾vival [40], the sample size calculation revealed the need
for inclusion of 44 patients to detect clinically relevant
GFR differences between groups (5 ml/minute/1.73 m2
per year). We are aware that choosing long-term kidney
transplant survival (for example, at 5 years) as a hard
primary endpoint may not be practical considering the
need for large sample sizes, extensive recruitment pe￾riods and excessive asset costs of study medication.
If our study proves that bortezomib can effectively
block DSA production and consequently improve trans￾plant outcomes, this finding will markedly challenge
current immunosuppressive standards. Considering the
high incidence of circulating donor-specific alloreactivity
and biopsy-proven AMR in long-term organ transplants,
our proof-of-concept study may have the potential to
provide a valuable basis for treatment guidelines improv￾ing long-term allograft outcomes.
Trial status
Recruitment of study patients (cross-sectional screening)
started on 14 October 2013. We expect completion of
enrolment in September 2014.
