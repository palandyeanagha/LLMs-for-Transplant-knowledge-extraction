Background: The prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is highly dependent on tumour extension
and liver function. Recently, two new prognostic scoring systems—the CLIP score, developed by Italian
investigators and the BCLC score, developed in Barcelona—have been widely used to assess prognosis in
patients presenting with hepatocellular carcinoma. Each system has its own relative limitations.
Aims: To create a new prognostic scoring system which is simple, easy to calculate, and suitable for
estimating prognosis during radical treatment of early HCC.
Methods: A total of 403 consecutive patients with HCC treated by percutaneous ablation at the
Department of Gastroenterology, University of Tokyo Hospital, between 1990 and 1997 were used as the
training sample to identify prognostic factors for our patients and used to develop the Tokyo score. As a
testing sample, 203 independent patients who underwent hepatectomy at the Department of Hepato￾Biliary-Pancreatic Surgery were studied. Prognostic factors were analysed by univariate and multivariate
Cox proportional hazard regression.
Results: The Tokyo score consists of four factors: serum albumin, bilirubin, and size and number of
tumours. Five year survival was 78.7%, 62.1%, 40.0%, 27.7%, and 14.3% for Tokyo scores 0, 1, 2, 3, and
4–6, respectively. The discriminatory ability of the Tokyo score was internally validated by bootstrap
methods. The Tokyo score, CLIP score, and BCLC staging were compared by Akaike information criterion
and Harrell’s c index among training and testing samples. In the testing sample, the predictive ability of the
Tokyo score was equal to CLIP and better than BCLC staging.
Conclusions: The Tokyo score is a simple system which provides good prediction of prognosis for Japanese
patients with HCC requiring radical therapy.
T
he prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) depends
on tumour extension as well as liver function.
Worldwide, most patients with hepatocellular carcinoma
have cirrhosis caused by chronic viral hepatitis (hepatitis C
(HCV), hepatitis B virus).1 Assessment of tumour related
factors in isolation, such as the tumour node metastasis
(TNM) staging,2 does not accurately predict the prognosis of
patients who have HCC and cirrhosis.3 The Child-Pugh
classification has been widely used to evaluate liver function
in cirrhotic patients, and has a relatively good correlation
with prognosis,4 but cannot be used to predict survival in
patients with HCC.
Okuda staging of HCC, established in 1985, is based on
tumour size and liver function, as assessed by three of the
four factors used in the Child Pugh score—namely, serum
albumin, bilirubin, and the presence of ascites—and for some
time has been used as the gold standard for prognostic
assessment of HCC patients.5 However, this prognostic
system was established by analysing patients mostly at an
advanced stage of HCC, with a median survival of
4.1 months. With current advances in clinical practice,
survival of HCC patients is now much longer, and the
Okuda staging is unable to accurately predict prognosis in
these patients.
Recently, several groups from Italy,6 Spain,7 France,8
Austria,9 and China10 proposed new prognostic systems for
HCC. While the latter three were developed using a sample of
patients with advanced disease (median survival 4–
8 months), the CLIP and BCLC systems developed scores
based on patients with early disease. The CLIP (Cancer of the
Liver Italian Program) score showed a good correlation with
the prognosis of HCC patients receiving various treatments,
including surgery, percutaneous ablation, transarterial chemo￾embolisation, and liver transplantation.6 11 12 Along with
liver function, as assessed by Child-Pugh stage, three tumour
factors were included. Tumour morphology was divided into
three categories: a single tumour (50% of the size of the liver
(score 0); multinodular HCC (50% of the size of the liver
(score 1); and massive HCC or tumour .50% of the size of
the liver (score 2). As in Okuda staging, tumour size was
broadly divided at 50% of liver volume. Seropositivity for a
fetoprotein (AFP) and the presence of portal vein thrombosis
were also included. However, due to advances in liver
imaging techniques, especially ultrasound and computed
tomography, HCC can now be detected at a much smaller
size, usually smaller than 5 cm in diameter, and tumours
smaller than 2 cm are frequently diagnosed. Tumour size is
associated with the pathological grade of HCC, the probability
of vascular invasion, and also with the prognosis of HCC
patients after potentially curative treatments such as surgical
resection and medical ablation.13 14 However, it is not known
whether a HCC of 2 cm is a determinant of prognosis as
previous models have not discriminated between large and
small tumours.

More recently, another staging system, the BCLC
(Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer), was developed and based
on both advanced and early HCC, dividing HCC into four
early stages (A1–A4) and three more advanced ones (B–D). It
contains elements of both the Okuda and Child-Pugh
classifications. Subclassification of early stages requires
formal measurement of hepatic venous pressure gradient
(HVPG), which is not applicable in all patients, although
clinical parameters (splenomegaly, etc) are now frequently
applied.7 In the present study, we sought to establish a new
scoring system that provides a more precise prediction of
prognosis in patients with early stage HCC.
PATIENTS AND METHODS
Training sample
Between January 1990 and December 1997, 403 patients with
naı¨ve HCC received medical ablation, either percutaneous
ethanol injection therapy (PEIT) or percutaneous microwave
coagulation therapy (PMCT), at the Department of
Gastroenterology, University of Tokyo Hospital. Their prog￾nosis was followed up until August 2001, and survival data
were used as the training samples in this study. HCC was
detected with ultrasound and/or computed tomography, and
confirmed histopathologically by percutaneous tumour
biopsy. Inclusion criteria for ablation were as follows: total
bilirubin ,3 mg/dl; platelet count .46105
/mm3
; prothrom￾bin activity .35%; and no intractable ascites. Although most
investigators performed PEIT in early stage HCC, such as for a
single nodule of (5 cm in diameter or less than three
nodules (3 cm in diameter,15 16 we did not limit the
indication for ablation to tumour size alone. Patients received
ablation therapy because surgery was not an option in terms
of impairment in liver function, or they voluntarily chose
ablation after informed consent although surgery was also
possible. The ablation procedures have been described
previously.17 18
The following variables obtained at initial ablation therapy
were used: age; sex; treatment modality (PEIT, PMCT, with
or without transcatheter arterial embolisation (TAE));
tumour factors, including size, number of nodules, lobar
distribution, and presence of extrahepatic metastasis; clinical
manifestations, including ascites and hepatic encephalopa￾thy; laboratory data, including albumin, bilirubin, prothrom￾bin activity, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine
aminotransferase, platelet count, and AFP; positivity for viral
markers (hepatitis B surface antigen and anti-hepatitis C
antibody); and alcohol consumption. Okuda stage, CLIP
score, and BCLC staging were also calculated using these
variables (tables 1–3). We substituted the presence of either
oesophageal varices or splenomegaly with platelet count less
than 100 000/mm3 for HVPG >10 mm Hg, as described by
Llovet and colleagues.7
All patients were placed under strict observation for
recurrence of HCC, with regularly repeated ultrasound,
computed tomography, and determination of serum tumour
markers. If recurrence of HCC was detected, patients received
additional treatments whenever possible—tumour ablation,
TAE, or systemic chemotherapy. For survival analysis, the
end point was death, and survival was censored on 31 August
2001.

Testing sample
Between October 1994 and December 1999, 203 patients with
naı¨ve HCC underwent hepatectomy at the Department of
Hepato-Biliary-Pancreatic Surgery, University of Tokyo
Hospital, and their survival data served as the testing sample.
Indications for hepatectomy and selection of the area for
resection were previously published.19 Briefly, the surgical
procedure was determined according to residual liver func￾tion, as determined by the severity of ascites, serum level of
bilirubin, and indocyanine green retention rate at 15 min￾utes. Patients with a bilirubin level .2 mg/dl or with
intractable ascites were contraindicated for hepatectomy.
Patients were followed up as described above, and survival
was censored on 31 August 2001.
Establishing a new prognostic score
We sought to construct a new prognostic model based on the
following principles.
(1) It is preferable to have two break points for continuous
variables such as tumour size or serum albumin
concentration because their distribution is wide and a
single break point may not be optimal.
(2) Variables must be those commonly assessed in clinical
practice to enable comparison between different institu￾tions.
(3) The model should not include established classifications
because they may be modified in the future, as was the
case for TNM staging, and different versions may be
confused.
We used survival time as the only end point in this
analysis. Firstly, we performed univariate Cox proportional
hazard regression to assess the statistical significance of each
candidate potential factor, and the factor was retained if a
significance level of p,0.05 was attained. Polychotomous
categorical data were represented by corresponding binary
dummy variables. Continuous variables, such as serum
concentration of albumin and size (diameter) of the tumour,
were transformed into categorical variables. We divided each
of these continuous variables into two or three levelled
categorical data by setting one or two break point(s),
respectively, which were then represented by one or two
binary variable(s); p values were calculated for each set of
break points with univariate or multivariate Cox proportional
hazard regression, and the set of break points showing the
lowest p value was retained if the value reached significance.
Factors showing statistical significance as a predictor were
further analysed using a multivariate Cox proportional
hazard regression model with stepwise selection of variables
based on the Akaike information criterion (AIC). AIC is a
measure of the goodness of fit (log likelihood) with a
‘‘penalty score’’ for the complexity of the model (number of
variables included), defined as
AIC = 22 6 (maximum log likelihood) + 2 6 (total
number of parameters),
and the optimum (that is, simplest effective) model gives the
lowest AIC value.20
A new prognostic score, designated the Tokyo score, was
established, assigning ordinal scores (0, 1 and 2) to each of
the selected factors according to the estimated regression
coefficient in the final model.
Internal validation
We used the bootstrap method for internal validation of the
Tokyo score system.21 Bootstrap validation is a method of
random re-sampling from a given set of samples to simulate
the effect of drawing samples from the same population. A
re-sampled data set of the same size as the original (training)
data set was obtained by random sampling with replace￾ment—in other words, each sample can be drawn more than
once or not at all. Differences in three and five year survival
rates were calculated between each pair of contiguous stages
(for example, between Tokyo scores 1 and 2) using Kaplan￾Meier estimation. Mean and 95% confidential interval of the
difference in three and five year survival rates between the
stages were determined by 2000 times itineration of such re￾sampling.
External validation
We validated the Tokyo score in the testing sample as well as
in the training sample with AIC and Harrell’s c index.22
Firstly, AIC was calculated in a Cox proportional regression
model containing Tokyo, CLIP, and BCLC stages. Then, AIC
was recalculated after removing each one of the scores, and
the changes in AIC were compared. The c index is equivalent
to the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve,
and ranges from 0.0 to 1.0. A c index of 1 indicates perfect

survival time and magnitude of prognostic score in the
current study) while an index of 0.5 indicates a chance

Statistics
Data are expressed as mean (SD) unless otherwise specified.
All statistical analyses were performed with S-plus 2000
(MathSoft Inc., Seattle, Washington, USA). Statistical
significance was set at p,0.05.
RESULTS
Patient profiles in the training sample
The training sample contained data from 293 male and 110
female patients. Baseline characteristics of the patients are
shown in table 4. Median age was 64 years, with 25% and
75% percentiles at 59 and 69 years, respectively. The majority
(83.4%) were HCV positive. The observation period was 3.9
(2.1) years, during which 250 patients died. Estimated 50%
survival time was 4.75 years. Only eight patients (2%) were
lost to follow up.
Selection of predictive factors
Univariate Cox proportional hazard analysis of the training
data set revealed that 15 factors were significantly associated
with prognosis of HCC patients (table 5). We included AST,
which showed marginal significance (p = 0.079), and per￾formed multivariate analysis on a total of 16 factors with
stepwise selection of variables using the AIC. There were four
variables which retained significance as independent pre￾dictors—namely, serum concentration of albumin, as ranked
by 3.5 g/dl and 2.8 g/dl, bilirubin concentration (1 mg/dl and
2 mg/dl), size of the tumour (diameters of 2 cm and 5 cm),
and number of tumour nodules (1–3 v .3) (table 6). Scores
were assigned to each of the four factors according to the
estimated regression coefficient in the final model (table 7)
and the Tokyo score was defined as the sum of each score.

Internal validation
Among the training sample, 55, 126, 104, 78, 30, 9, and 3
patients were classified as Tokyo scores 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6,
respectively. Observed cumulative survival of patients
grouped by Tokyo score was calculated using the Kaplan￾Meier method (fig 1). Prognosis was well distributed among
the groups based on the Tokyo score. Five year survival rates
for Tokyo scores 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4–6 were 78.7%, 62.1%, 40.0%,
27.7%, and 14.3%, respectively. This was confirmed by
internal validation where differences in three and five year
survival rates were calculated, along with 95% confidence
interval, between each pair of two contiguous stages using
the bootstrap method. The lower confidence limit of
difference between each pair of two contiguous stages was
greater than zero, indicating that all differences were
statistically significant (table 8). The Tokyo score was
therefore shown to be highly robust in estimating prognosis
in distinct groups.
External validation
Baseline characteristics of the patients in the testing sample,
who underwent surgical resection, are shown in table 9.
Median age and sex proportions were similar to those in the
training sample while these patients had better liver function
reserve and the average tumour size was larger. Sixty five
patients died during the observation period and median
survival time was 5.7 years. Tokyo, CLIP, and BCLC stages
were calculated according to the variables obtained from each
patient.
The Tokyo Score, CLIP score, and BCLC staging were
compared in both the training and testing samples by
evaluating the AIC on Cox proportional hazard regression
models. Goodness of fit of the model estimated by AIC was
improved by removing BCLC from the model containing
Tokyo, CLIP, and BCLC. AIC was greater in the model with
either the Tokyo score or CLIP score alone than in the model
containing both (table 10). These results indicate that the
Tokyo and CLIP scores complement each other whereas
addition of BCLC resulted in no improvement to the model.
However, the increment was smaller when the CLIP score
was removed, indicating that the model with the Tokyo score
was more informative than that with the CLIP score. The c
indices for the Tokyo score, CLIP score, and BCLC staging
were 0.733, 0.707, and 0.657 in the testing sample and 0.737,
0.758, and 0.710 in the training sample, indicating that the
Tokyo score was steadily effective in patients from different
backgrounds.
DISCUSSION
The aim of this study was to create a novel, simple, prognostic
scoring system that would provide a precise prediction of
prognosis for patients who were candidates for radical
therapy, such as percutaneous ablation or surgical resection.
In addition, this scoring system would be used to stratify
patients to enable comparison of the efficacy of distinct

treatments or among different institutions. Hence the ideal
staging system should provide maximal discrimination of
outcomes between different stages of disease while keeping
the variability of outcomes within each stage to a minimum.
The Okuda staging system is not applicable to HCC patients
at an early stage of disease as these patients are now eligible
for potentially curative treatments, such as medical ablation
or surgical resection. As such, while it was useful when first
devised, the Okuda scoring or staging system is now
generally considered obsolete. Thus 75% of the patients in
the training sample and 90% in the testing sample were
classified as Okuda stage I. Further stratification of the group
is clearly needed. Recently proposed systems from France,8
Austria,9 and China10 were developed in patients with
advanced disease with a median survival of only 4–8 months.
We calculated the scores using the French, Austrian, and
Chinese criteria in the training sample but all of these
systems classified patients into only two stages, and most
patients belonged to stage I (data not shown).
One of the outstanding merits of Okuda staging is the fact
that it consists of four simple parameters—namely, tumour
size, ascites, serum albumin, and bilirubin. In constructing
the Tokyo score, we followed this simplistic approach. We
examined only those parameters that are easily obtainable
and avoided criteria that are not generally available.
Moreover, we used the AIC in the selection of parameters
to obtain a simple model without too many independent
parameters or complicated computation. We believe this
quality to be very important, especially in projecting retro￾spective analysis without omitting any patient because of
missing values.
We adopted two tumour factors, size and number, in the
final model. Tumour size was divided into three groups with
break points of 2 cm and 5 cm in diameter. Several studies
have identified tumour size in this range as signifi￾cant,7 13 14 23 24 and a strong correlation with microvascular
invasion and pathological grade of malignancy has been
demonstrated.23 25 However, previously proposed scoring or
staging systems, except for BCLC staging, did not include
tumour size,8 or else divided the tumour broadly into massive
and other, usually using the break point of half the volume of
the liver.569 Thus differences in the present and previous
scoring systems are primarily seen in the characteristics of
the target populations, as reflected by our objective of
defining a prognostic scoring system which would discrimi￾nate between the relatively early stages of HCC. By the same
token, we did not adopt tumour related symptoms, which
were included in the BCLC and French systems,7 8 as almost
all of our patients were asymptomatic.
The number of tumour nodules is also known to be
associated with intrahepatic spread of malignant cells. Some
authors reported a major difference in prognosis between
solitary and multinodular HCC after surgical resection.13 26 27
However, we found that the number of nodules was best
divided dichotomously between 1–3 and >4. The suggestion
is that the presence of two or three nodules might often be
the result of simultaneous independent carcinogenesis rather
than intrahepatic metastasis in patients with advanced
cirrhosis.
Evident vascular invasion such as portal vein tumour
thrombus is an absolute predictor of ominous prognosis.3 13 26
Overt metastases to extrahepatic organs or lymph nodes are
also associated with poor prognosis. As the testing sample
contained few patients with these two manifestations, they
were not selected after stepwise variable selection. It should
be noted that the Tokyo score may not be predictive for
advanced disease.
We selected two factors, albumin and bilirubin, as indi￾cators of liver function. Both are included in the Child-Pugh
classification, together with prothrombin time, ascites, and
encephalopathy, and thus were also included in the CLIP
score as a factor in the Child-Pugh classification. However,
the latter three were not selected after stepwise variable
selection because they were strongly correlated with the
former two. Thus liver function is represented by two
parameters, which we believe is preferable for the sake of
model simplicity.
Portal hypertension is accepted as a strong predictor of
poor prognosis. Among our candidate factors, ascites,
encephalopathy, and platelet count were considered as
related to portal hypertension and all were significant in
the univariate analysis. Bruix et al reported that HVPG was a
significant predictor of decompensation after hepatic resec￾tion28 and it is included in the BCLC staging system. However,
HVPG is a special examination which is not routinely carried
out in daily practice. We substituted the presence of
oesophageal varices and platelet count less than 100 000/
mm3 for HVPG >10 mm Hg, as described by the author, but
the substitution may have impaired the prognostic power of
the BCLC staging in the samples.
Prognostic scores can be divided into two groups: those
based on expert opinion, such as TNM staging, and those
developed through regression analysis of actual data, such as
the CLIP and Tokyo scores. We applied bootstrap methods to
avoid possible overfitting bias that often accompanies regres￾sion analysis. Nevertheless, the fact that the Tokyo score
fitted better in the training sample than in the testing sample
may indicate that there remained some overfitting bias.
Another possible reason why the Tokyo score did not surpass
the CLIP score in the testing sample was the presence of AFP
in the latter but not in the former. Over 20% of patients in the
testing sample had AFP levels .400 ng/ml compared with
10% in the training sample. It is reasonable to assume that
AFP plays a more important role in advanced disease.
BCLC staging, developed from several independent studies
on both early and advanced patients, includes treatment
strategy, indicating that a single HCC without portal
hypertension should be resected and that patients with no
more than three nodules not exceeding 3 cm in diameter
have indications for ablation therapy. Recently, Cillo et al
found that BCLC was the best among staging systems,
including CLIP, in patients treated with radical therapies.29
One possible reason why BCLC staging did not show
greater ability in the testing and training samples may be
that our patients were not always treated according to the
strategy.
The relative prognostic importance of each factor depends
on the features of the patients in the training sample, as do
the independent variables remaining after stepwise selection.
Child-Pugh classification and the model for end stage liver
disease (MELD) are suitable for assessing the prognosis of
patients with severely impaired liver function30 while only
tumour related factors are relevant in assessing outcome after
liver transplantation for HCC patients.31 32 Similarly, the
applicability of the Tokyo score is limited by the fact that it
was established and validated on the basis of HCC patients
treated by medical ablation or surgical resection. However,
with the growing realisation of high risk groups for HCC and
rapid advances in imaging techniques, an increasing number
of patients are being diagnosed at an earlier stage, and
qualify for potentially curative treatments, such as medical
ablation and surgical resection.
In conclusion, we established the Tokyo score by analysing
survival time among HCC patients treated with medical
ablation, and validated it in patients who underwent surgical
resection. The Tokyo score may be useful in predicting the
prognosis of HCC patients who are candidates for these
curative treatments.
