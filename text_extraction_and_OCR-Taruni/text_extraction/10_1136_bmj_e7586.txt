 High quality protocols facilitate proper 
conduct, reporting, and external review of 
clinical trials. However, the completeness 
of trial protocols is often inadequate. To 
help improve the content and quality 
of protocols, an international group of 
stakeholders developed the SPIRIT 2013 
Statement (Standard Protocol Items: 
Recommendations for Interventional Trials). 
The SPIRIT Statement provides guidance 
in the form of a checklist of recommended 
items to include in a clinical trial protocol.
 This SPIRIT 2013 Explanation and 
Elaboration paper provides important 
information to promote full understanding 
of the checklist recommendations. For each 
checklist item, we provide a rationale and 
detailed description; a model example from 
an actual protocol; and relevant references 
supporting its importance. We strongly 
recommend that this explanatory paper 
be used in conjunction with the SPIRIT 
Statement. A website of resources is also 
available (www.spirit-statement.org).
 The SPIRIT 2013 Explanation and 
Elaboration paper, together with the 
Statement, should help with the drafting of 
trial protocols. Complete documentation 
of key trial elements can facilitate 
transparency and protocol review for the 
benefit of all stakeholders.
Every clinical trial should be based on a protocol—a docu￾ment that details the study rationale, proposed methods, 
organisation, and ethical considerations. 1
 Trial investiga￾tors and sta" use protocols to document plans for study 
conduct at all stages from participant recruitment to results 
dissemination. Funding agencies, research ethics com￾mittees/institutional review boards, regulatory agencies, 
medical journals, systematic reviewers, and other groups 
rely on protocols to appraise the conduct and reporting of 
clinical trials. 
 To meet the needs of these diverse stakeholders, pro￾tocols should adequately address key trial elements. 
However, protocols o# en lack information on important 
concepts relating to study design and dissemination 
plans. 2-12 Guidelines for writing protocols can help improve 
their completeness, but existing guidelines vary exten￾sively in their content and have limitations, including non￾systematic methods of development, limited stakeholder 
involvement, and lack of citation of empirical evidence to 
support their recommendations. 13 As a result, there is also 
variation in the precise de& nition and scope of a trial proto￾col, particularly in terms of its relation to other documents 
such as procedure manuals. 14
 
 Given the importance of trial protocols, an international 
group of stakeholders launched the SPIRIT (Standard Pro￾tocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials) 
Initiative in 2007 with the primary aim of improving the 
content of trial protocols. The main outputs are the SPIRIT 
2013 Statement, 14 consisting of a 33 item checklist of mini￾mum recommended protocol items (table 1) plus a diagram 
(& g1); and this accompanying Explanation and Elaboration 
(E&E) paper. Additional information and resources are also 
available on the SPIRIT website ( www.spirit-statement.org ). 
 The SPIRIT 2013 Statement and E&E paper re1 ect the 
collaboration and input of 115 contributors, including 
trial investigators, healthcare professionals, methodolo￾gists, statisticians, trial coordinators, journal editors, as 
well as representatives from research ethics committees, 
industry and non-industry funders, and regulatory agen￾cies. Details of the scope and methods have been published 
elsewhere. 13-15 Brie1 y, three complementary methods were 
speci& ed beforehand , in line with current recommenda￾tions for development of reporting guidelines 16 : 1) a Delphi 
consensus survey 15 ; 2) two systematic reviews to identify 
existing protocol guidelines and empirical evidence sup￾porting the importance of speci& c checklist items; and 3) 
two face-to-face consensus meetings to & nalise the SPIRIT 
2013 checklist. Furthermore, the checklist was pilot tested 
by graduate course students, and an implementation strat￾egy was developed at a stakeholder meeting. 
 The SPIRIT recommendations are intended as a guide 
for those preparing the full protocol for a clinical trial. 
A clinical trial is a prospective study in which one or more

i nt erventions are assigned to human participants in order 
to assess the e" ects on health related outcomes. The recom￾mendations are not intended to prescribe how a trial should 
be designed or conducted. Rather, we call for a transparent 
and complete description of what is intended, regardless 
of the characteristics or quality of the plans. The SPIRIT 
2013 Statement addresses the minimum content for inter￾ventional trials; additional concepts may be important to 
describe in protocols for trials of speci& c designs (eg, crosso￾ver trials) or in protocols intended for submission to speci& c 
groups (eg, funders, research ethics committees/institu￾tional review boards). If information for a recommended 
item is not yet available when the protocol is being & nalised 
(eg, funding sources), this should be explicitly stated and 
the protocol updated as new information is obtained. For￾matting conventions such as a table of contents, glossary of 
non-standard or ambiguous terms (eg, randomisation phase 
or o" -protocol), and list of abbreviations and references will 
facilitate understanding of the protocol. 
 Purpose and development of explanation and elaboration 
paper 
 Modelled a# er other reporting guidelines, 17
 
 18 this E&E paper 
presents each checklist item with at least one model example 
from an actual protocol, followed by a full explanation of the 
rationale and main issues to address. This E&E paper pro￾vides important information to facilitate full understanding 
of each checklist item, and is intended to be used in conjunc￾tion with the SPIRIT 2013 Statement. 14 These complemen￾tary tools serve to inform trial investigators about important 
issues to consider in the protocol as they relate to trial design, 
conduct, reporting, and organisation. 
 To identify examples for each checklist item, we obtained 
protocols from public websites, journals, trial investigators, 
and industry sponsors. Model examples were selected to 
re1 ect how key elements could be appropriately described 
in a trial protocol. Some examples illustrate a speci& c com￾ponent of a checklist item, while others encompass all key 
recommendations for an item. Additional examples are also 
available on the SPIRIT website ( www.spirit-statement.org ). 
The availability of examples for all checklist items indicates 
the feasibility of addressing each recommended item in the 
main protocol rather than in separate documents. 
 Examples are quoted verbatim from the trial protocol. 
Proper names of trial personnel have been abbreviated with 
italicised initials, and any reference numbers cited in the 
original quoted text are denoted by [ Reference ] to distinguish 
them from references cited in this E&E paper. 
 For each checklist item we also strived to provide refer￾ences to empirical data supporting its relevance, which we 
identi& ed through a systematic review conducted to inform 
the content of the SPIRIT checklist. We searched MEDLINE, 
the Cochrane Methodology Register, and the Cochrane Data￾base of Systematic Reviews (limited to methodology reviews) 
up to September 2009, and EMBASE up to August 2007. We 
searched reference lists, PubMed “related articles,” and cita￾tion searches using SCOPUS to identify additional relevant 
studies. We used piloted forms to screen and extract data 
relevant to speci& c checklist items. 
 Studies were included if they provided empirical data to 
support or refute the importance of a given protocol concept. 
A summary of the relevant methodological articles was pro￾vided to each E&E author for use in preparing the initial dra# 
text for up to six checklist items; each dra# was also reviewed 
and revised by a second author. When citing empirical evi￾dence in the E&E, we aimed to reference a systematic review 
when available. When no review was identi& ed, we either 
cited all relevant individual studies, or if too numerous, a 
representative sample of the literature. Some items had little 
or no identi& ed empirical evidence (eg, title) but their inclu￾sion in the checklist is supported by a strong pragmatic or 
ethical rationale. Where relevant, we also provide references 
to non-empirical publications for further reading. 
 Two lead authors (AWC, JMT) collated and re& ned the 
content and format for all items, and then circulated three 
iterations of an overall dra# to the coauthors for editing and 
& nal approval.

searches and rapid judgment of relevance. 20 It can also 
be helpful to include the trial framework (eg, superiority, 
non-inferiority), study objective or primary outcome, and 
if relevant, the study phase (eg, phase II). 
 Trial registration—registry 
 Item 2a: Trial identifier and registry name. If not yet 
registered, name of intended registry 
 Explanation 
 There are compelling ethical and scienti& c reasons for trial 
registration. 22-24 Documentation of a trial’s existence on a 
publicly accessible registry can help to increase transpar￾ency, 24
 
 25 decrease unnecessary duplication of research 
e" ort, facilitate identi& cation of ongoing trials for prospec￾tive participants, and identify selective reporting of study 
results. 26-28 As mandated by the International Committee of 
Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) and jurisdictional legisla￾tion, 29-31 registration of clinical trials should occur before 
recruitment of the & rst trial participant. 
 We recommend that registry names and trial identifiers 
assigned by the registries be prominently placed in the proto￾col, such as on the cover page. If the trial is not yet registered, 
the intended registry should be indicated and the protocol 
updated upon registration. When registration in multiple reg￾istries is required (eg, to meet local regulation), each identi-
& er should be clearly listed in the protocol and each registry. 
 Trial registration—data set 
 Item 2b: All items from the World Health Organization 
Trial Registration Data Set 
 Example: see table 2 
 Explanation 
 In addition to a trial registration number, the World Health 
Organization (WHO) recommends a minimum standard 
list of items to be included in a trial registry in order for a 
trial to be considered fully registered ( www.who.int/ictrp/
network/trds/en/index.html ). These standards are sup￾ported by ICMJE, other journal editors, and jurisdictional 
legislation. 29-31 We recommend that the WHO Trial Registra￾tion Data Set be included in the protocol to serve as a brief 
structured summary of the trial. Its inclusion in the protocol 
can also signal updates for the registry when associated 
protocol sections are amended—thereby promoting con￾sistency between information in the protocol and registry.

 Explanation 
 Sequentially labelling and dating each protocol version 
helps to mitigate potential confusion over which d ocument 
Section/item ItemNo Description
21b Description of any interim analyses and stopping guidelines, including who will have access to these interim results and make the final decision to terminate 
the trial
Harms 22 Plans for collecting, assessing, reporting, and managing solicited and spontaneously reported adverse events and other unintended effects of trial 
interventions or trial conduct
Auditing 23 Frequency and procedures for auditing trial conduct, if any, and whether the process will be independent from investigators and the sponsor
Ethics and dissemination

IRBs, trial participants, trial registries, journals, regulators)
Consent or assent 26a Who will obtain informed consent or assent from potential trial participants or authorised surrogates, and how (see Item 32)
26b Additional consent provisions for collection and use of participant data and biological specimens in ancillary studies, if applicable
Confidentiality 27 How personal information about potential and enrolled participants will be collected, shared, and maintained in order to protect confidentiality before, during, 
and after the trial
Declaration of interests 28 Financial and other competing interests for principal investigators for the overall trial and each study site
Access to data 29 Statement of who will have access to the final trial dataset, and disclosure of contractual agreements that limit such access for investigators
Ancillary and post-trial care 30 Provisions, if any, for ancillary and post-trial care, and for compensation to those who suffer harm from trial participation
Dissemination policy 31a Plans for investigators and sponsor to communicate trial results to participants, healthcare professionals, the public, and other relevant groups (eg, via 
publication, reporting in results databases, or other data sharing arrangements), including any publication restrictions
31b Authorship eligibility guidelines and any intended use of professional writers

RESEARCH METHODS AND REPORTING
Although both industry funded and non-industry funded 
trials are susceptible to bias, 4
 
 35 the former are more likely 
to report trial results and conclusions that favour their 
own interventions. 27
 
 36- 39 This tendency could be due to 
industry trials being more likely to select e" ective inter￾ventions for evaluation (Item 6a), to use less e" ective 
control interventions (Item 6b), or to selectively report 
outcomes (Item 12), analyses (Item 20) or full studies 
(Item 31). 38
 
 40- 43 Non-& nancial support (eg, provision of 
drugs) from industry has not been shown to be associated 
with biased results, although few studies have examined 
this issue. 44
 
 45
 At a minimum, the protocol should identify the sources 
of & nancial and non-& nancial support; the speci& c type 
(eg, funds, equipment, drugs, services) and time period of 
support; and any vested interest that the funder may have 
in the trial. If a trial is not yet funded when the protocol is 
& rst written, the proposed sources of support should be 
listed and updated as funders are con& rmed. 
 No clear consensus exists regarding the level of addi￾tional funding details that should be provided in the trial 
protocol as opposed to trial contracts, although full dis￾closure of funding information in the protocol can help to 
better identify & nancial competing interests. Some juris￾dictional guidelines require more detailed disclosure, 
including monetary amounts granted from each funder, 
the mechanism of providing & nancial support (eg, paid 
in & xed sum or per recruited participant), and the speci& c 
fund recipient (eg, trial investigator, department/insti￾tute). 46 Detailed disclosure allows research ethics com￾mittees/institutional review boards (REC/IRBs) to assess 
whether the reimbursement amount is reasonable in rela￾tion to the time and expenses incurred for trial conduct. 
is the most recent. Explicitly listing the changes made rela￾tive to the previous protocol version is also important (see 
Item 25). Transparent tracking of versions and amend￾ments facilitates trial conduct, review, and oversight.

 Item 4: Sources and types of financial, material, and other 
support 
 Explanation 
 A description of the sources of & nancial and non-& nancial 
support provides relevant information to assess study 
feasibility and potential competing interests (Item 28).

RESEARCH METHODS AND REPORTING
 Roles and responsibilities—sponsor and funder 
 Item 5c: Role of study sponsor and funders, if any, in 
study design; collection, management, analysis, and 
interpretation of data; writing of the report; and the 
decision to submit the report for publication, including 
whether they will have ultimate authority over any of 
these activities 
 Explanation 
 There is potential for bias when the trial sponsor or 
funder (sometimes the same entity) has competing 
interests (Item 28) and substantial in1 uence on the 
planning, conduct, or reporting of a trial. Empirical 
research indicates that speci& c forms of bias tend to be 
more prevalent in trials funded by industry compared 
to those funded by non-commercial sources. 36-38
 
 45
 
 55- 60
The design, analysis, interpretation, and reporting 
of most industry-initiated trials are controlled by the 
sponsor; this authority is o# en enforced by contractual 
agreements signed between the sponsor and trial inves￾tigators (Item 29). 10
 
 61
 
 The protocol should explicitly outline the roles and 
responsibilities of the sponsor and any funders in study 
design, conduct, data analysis and interpretation, man￾uscript writing, and dissemination of results. It is also 
important to state whether the sponsor or funder con￾trols the & nal decision regarding any of these aspects 
of the trial. 
 Despite the importance of declaring the roles of the trial 
sponsor and funders, few protocols explicitly do so. 
Among 44 protocols for industry-initiated trials receiv￾ing ethics approval in Denmark from 1994-95, none 
stated explicitly who had contributed to the design of 
the trial. 9
 
 Roles and responsibilities—committees 
 Item 5d: Composition, roles, and responsibilities of 
the coordinating centre, steering committee, endpoint 
adjudication committee, data management team, 
and other individuals or groups overseeing the trial, if 
applicable (see Item 21a for data monitoring committee) 
 Explanation 
 The protocol should outline the general membership of 
the various committees or groups involved in trial coor￾dination and conduct; describe the roles and responsi￾bilities of each; and (when known) identify the chairs 
and members. This information helps to ensure that 
roles and responsibilities are clearly understood at the 
trial onset, and facilitates communication from exter￾nal parties regarding the trial. It also enables readers to 
understand the mandate and expertise of those respon￾sible for overseeing participant safety, study design, 
database integrity, and study conduct. For example, 
empirical evidence supports the pivotal role of an epide￾miologist or biostatistician in designing and conducting 
higher quality trials. 63
 
 64
 
 Roles and responsibilities—contributorship 
 Item 5a: Names, affiliations, and roles of protocol 
contributors 
 Explanation 
 Individuals who contribute substantively to protocol 
development and dra# ing should have their contribu￾tions reported. As with authorship of journal articles, 48
listing the protocol contributors, their a8 liations, and 
their roles in the protocol development process provides 
due recognition, accountability, and transparency. Nam￾ing of contributors can also help to identify competing 
interests and reduce ghost authorship (Items 28 and 
31b). 9
 
 10 If professional medical writers are employed to 
dra# the protocol, then this should be acknowledged as 
well. 
 Naming of authors and statements of contributorship 
are standard for protocols published in journals such as 
Trials49 but are uncommon for unpublished protocols. 
Only & ve of 44 industry-initiated protocols approved in 
1994-95 by a Danish research ethics committee explicitly 
identi& ed the protocol authors. 9
 Roles and responsibilities—sponsor contact information 
 Item 5b: Name and contact information for the trial 
sponsor 
 Explanation 
 The sponsor can be de& ned as the individual, company, 
institution, or organisation assuming overall responsi￾bility for the initiation and management of the trial, 
and is not necessarily the main funder. 51
 
 52 In general, 
the company is the sponsor in industry initiated trials, 
while the funding agency or institution of the principal 
investigator is o# en the sponsor for investigator initiated 
trials. For some investigator initiated trials, the principal 
inv estigator can be considered to be a “sponsor-inves￾tigator” who assumes both sponsor and investigator 
roles. 51
 
 53
 
 Identi& cation of the trial sponsor provides transpar￾ency and accountability. The protocol should identify the 
name, contact information, and if applicable, the regula￾tory agency identifying number of the sponsor. 
 Example 
 “ RTL [address], EJM [address], AK [address] . . . 
 Authors’ contributions 
 RTL conceived of the study. AK , EN , SB , PR , WJ , JH , and 
MC initiated the study design and JK and LG helped with 
implementation. RTL , JK , LG , and FP are grant holders. LT and 
EM provided statistical expertise in clinical trial design and 
RN is conducting the primary statistical analysis. All authors 
contributed to refinement of the study protocol and approved 
the final manuscript.” 47
 Example 
 “Trial Sponsor: University of Nottingham 
 Sponsor’s Reference: RIS 8024 . . . 
 Contact name: Mr PC 
 Address: King’s Meadow Campus . . . 
 Telephone: . . . 
 Email: . . .” 50
 
 Example 
 “This funding source had no role in the design of this study 
and will not have any role during its execution, analyses, 
interpretation of the data, or decision to submit results.” 54

 69 It is 
also relevant to funders, REC/IRBs, and other stakehold￾ers who evaluate the scienti& c and ethical basis for trial 
conduct. 
 To place the trial in the context of available evidence, 
it is strongly recommended that an up-to-date systematic 
review of relevant studies be summarised and cited in the 
protocol. 70 Several funders request this information in 
grant applications. 71
 
 72 Failure to review the cumulated evi￾dence can lead to unnecessary duplication of research or

for undertaking the trial, including summary of relevant 
studies (published and unpublished) examining benefits

 Explanation 
 The value of a research question, as well as the ethical 
and scienti& c justi& cation for a trial, depend to a large 
degree on the uncertainty of the comparative bene& ts or 
harms of the interventions, which depends in turn on the 
existing body of knowledge on the topic. The background 
section of a protocol should summarise the importance of 
the research question, justify the need for the trial in the 
context of available evidence, and present any available 
data regarding the potential e" ects of the interventions 
(e8 cacy and harms). 66

 Example 
 “Background 
Introduction: For people at ages 5 to 45 years, trauma is second 
only to HIV/AIDS as a cause of death. . . . 
Mechanisms : The haemostatic system helps to maintain the 
integrity of the circulatory system after severe vascular injury, 
whether traumatic or surgical in origin.[reference] Major 
surgery and trauma trigger similar haemostatic responses . 
. . Antifibrinolytic agents have been shown to reduce blood 
loss in patients with both normal and exaggerated fibrinolytic 
responses to surgery, and do so without apparently increasing 
the risk of post-operative complications, . . . 
Existing knowledge : Systemic antifibrinolytic agents are widely 
used in major surgery to prevent fibrinolysis and thus reduce 
surgical blood loss. A recent systematic review [reference] of 
randomised controlled trials of antifibrinolytic agents (mainly 
aprotinin or tranexamic acid) in elective surgical patients 
identified 89 trials including 8,580 randomised patients (74 trials 
in cardiac, eight in orthopaedic, four in liver, and three in vascular 
surgery). The results showed that these treatments reduced the 
numbers needing transfusion by one third, reduced the volume 
needed per transfusion by one unit, and halved the need for 
further surgery to control bleeding. These differences were all 
highly statistically significant. There was also a statistically non￾significant reduction in the risk of death (RR=0.85: 95% CI 0.63 to 
1.14) in the antifibrinolytic treated group. 
 . . . 
Need for a trial : A simple and widely practicable treatment that 
reduces blood loss following trauma might prevent thousands of 
premature trauma deaths each year and secondly could reduce 
exposure to the risks of blood transfusion. Blood is a scarce and 
expensive resource and major concerns remain about the risk 
of transfusion-transmitted infection. . . . A large randomised trial 
is therefore needed of the use of a simple, inexpensive, widely 
practicable antifibrinolytic treatment such as tranexamic acid 
. . . in a wide range of trauma patients who, when they reach 
hospital are thought to be at risk of major haemorrhage that 
could significantly affect their chances of survival. 
 Dose selection 
 The systematic review of randomised controlled trials of 
antifibrinolytic agents in surgery showed that dose regimens of 
tranexamic acid vary widely.[reference] . . . 
 In this emergency situation, administration of a fixed dose would 
be more practicable as determining the weight of a patient would 
be impossible. Therefore a fixed dose within the dose range which 
has been shown to inhibit fibrinolysis and provide haemostatic 
benefit is being used for this trial. . . . The planned duration of 
administration allows for the full effect of tranexamic acid on the 
immediate risk of haemorrhage without extending too far into the 
acute phase response seen after surgery and trauma.” 65

previously been shown to be superior to placebo. 74
 
 97 In 
a systematic review of over 100 head-to-head antibiotic 
trials for mild to moderate chronic obstructive pulmo￾nary disease, 74 cumulative meta-analysis of preceding 
placebo controlled trials did not show a signi& cant e" ect 
of antibiotics over placebo. Such studies again highlight 
the importance of providing a thorough background 
and rationale for a trial and the choice of comparators—
including data from an up-to-date systematic review—to 
enable potential participants, physicians, REC/IRBs, and 
funders to discern the merit of the trial. 
 Objectives 
 Item 7: Specific objectives or hypotheses 
 Explanation 
 The study objectives re1 ect the scienti& c questions to be 
answered by the trial, and de& ne its purpose and scope. 
They are closely tied to the trial design (Item 8) and a nalysis 
methods (Item 20). For example, the sample size calcula￾tion and statistical analyses for superiority trials will di" er 
from those investigating non-inferiority. 
 The objectives are generally phrased using neutral word￾ing (eg, “to compare the e" ect of treatment A versus treat￾ment B on outcome X”) rather than in terms of a particular 
direction of e" ect. 99 A hypothesis states the predicted e" ect of 
the interventions on the trial outcomes. For multiarm trials, 
the objectives should clarify the way in which all the treat￾ment groups will be compared (eg, A versus B; A versus C). 
were aware of a relevant existing review when they had 
designed their trial. 79 Given that about half of trials remain 
unpublished, 80-82 and that published trials o# en represent 
a biased subset of all trials, 80
 
 83 it is important that system￾atic reviews include a search of online resources such as 
trial registries, results databases, and regulatory agency 
websites. 84
 
 Background and rationale—choice of comparators 
 Item 6b: Explanation for choice of comparators 
 Explanation 
 The choice of control interventions has important implica￾tions for trial ethics, recruitment, results, and interpre￾tation. In trials comparing an intervention to an active 
control or usual care, a clear description of the rationale 
for the comparator intervention will facilitate under￾standing of its appropriateness. 86
 
 87 For example, a trial 
in which the control group receives an inappropriately 
low dose of an active drug will ove restimate the relative 
e8 cacy of the study intervention in clinical practice; con￾versely, an inappropriately high dose in the control group 
will lead to an underestimate of the relative harms of the 
study intervention. 87
 
 88
 The appropriateness of using placebo-only control 
groups has been the subject of extensive debate and mer￾its careful consideration of the existence of other e" ec￾tive treatments, the potential risks to trial par ticipants, 
and the need for assay sensitivity—that is, ability to dis￾tinguish an e" ective intervention from less e" ective or 
ine" ective interventions. 89
 
 90 In addition, surveys have 
demonstrated that a potential barrier to trial participa￾tion is the possibility of being allocated a placebo-only 
or active control intervention that is perceived to be less 
desirable than the study inter vention. 68
 
 69
 
 91
 
 92 Evidence 
also suggests that enrolled participants perceive the e" ect 
of a given intervention di" erently depending on whether 
the control group consists of an active comparator or only 
placebo. 93-96
 Finally, studies suggest that some “active” compara￾tors in head-to-head randomised trials are presumed by 
 Example 
 “1.1 Research hypothesis 
 Apixaban is noninferior to warfarin for prevention of stroke 
(hemorrhagic, ischemic or of unspecified type) or systemic 
embolism in subjects with atrial fibrillation (AF) and additional 
risk factor(s) for stroke. 
 . . . 
 2 STUDY OBJECTIVES
 2.1 Primary objective 
 To determine if apixaban is noninferior to warfarin (INR 
[international normalized ratio] target range 2.0-3.0) in the 
combined endpoint of stroke (hemorrhagic, ischemic or of 
unspecified type) and systemic embolism, in subjects with AF and 
at least one additional risk factor for stroke. 
 2.2 Secondary objectives 
 2.2.1 Key secondary objectives 
 The key secondary objectives are to determine, in subjects with 
AF and at least one additional risk factor for stroke, if apixaban is 
superior to warfarin (INR target range 2.0 - 3.0) for, 
• the combined endpoint of stroke (hemorrhagic, ischemic or of 
unspecified type) and systemic embolism 
• major bleeding [International Society of Thrombosis and 
Hemostasis] 
• all-cause death 
 2.2.2 Other secondary objectives 
• To compare, in subjects with AF and at least one additional risk 
factor for stroke, apixaban and warfarin with respect to: 
 The composite endpoint of stroke (ischemic, hemorrhagic, 
or of unspecified type), systemic embolism and major 
bleeding, in warfarin naive subjects 
 . . . 
• To assess the safety of apixaban in subjects with AF and at least 
one additional risk factor for stroke.” 98
 
 Example 
 “Choice of comparator 
 In spite of the increasing numbers of resistant strains, 
chloroquine monotherapy is still recommended as standard 
blood-stage therapy for patients with P [ Plasmodium ] vivax
malaria in the countries in which this trial will be conducted. Its 
selection as comparator is therefore justified. The adult dose 
of chloroquine will be 620 mg for 2 days followed by 310 mg 
on the third day and for children 10 mg/kg for the first two 
days and 5 mg/kg for the third day. Total dose is in accordance 
with the current practice in the countries where the study is 
conducted. The safety profile of chloroquine is well established 
and known. Although generally well tolerated, the following 
side-effects of chloroquine treatment have been described: 
 Gastro-intestinal disturbances, headache, hypotension, 
convulsions, visual disturbances, depigmentation or loss of 
hair, skin reactions (rashes, pruritus) and, rarely, bone-marrow 
suppression and hypersensitivity reactions such as urticaria 
and angioedema. Their occurrence during the present trial 
may however be unlikely given the short (3-day) duration of 
treatment.” 85

RESEARCH METHODS AND REPORTING
 Explanation 
 A description of the environment in which a trial will be con￾ducted provides important context in terms of the applicabil￾ity of the study results; the existence and type of applicable 
local regulation and ethics oversight; and the type of health￾care and research infrastructure available. These considera￾tions can vary substantially within and between countries. 
 At a minimum, the countries , type of setting (eg, urban 
versus rural), and the likely number of study sites should be 
reported in the protocol. These factors have been associated 
with recruitment success and degree of attrition for some tri￾als, 68
 
 91
 
 92
 
 114- 117 but not for others. 118
 
 119 Trial location has also 
been associated with trial outcome, 120 aspects of trial quality 
(eg, authenticity of randomisation 121 ), and generalisability. 122
 Eligibility criteria 
 Item 10: Inclusion and exclusion criteria for participants. 
If applicable, eligibility criteria for study centres and 
individuals who will perform the interventions (eg, 
surgeons, psychotherapists) 
 Explanation 
 Eligibility criteria for potential trial participants de& ne the 
study population. They can relate to demographic informa￾tion; type or severity of the health condition; comorbidities; 
previous or current treatment; diagnostic procedures; preg￾nancy; or other relevant considerations. 125 In trials of operator￾dependent interventions such as surgery and psychotherapy, 
it is usually important to promote consistency of intervention 
delivery by also de& ning the eligibility criteria for care provid￾ers and centres where the intervention will be administered. 126
 Clear delineation of eligibility criteria serves several 
purposes. It enables study personnel to apply these cri￾teria consistently throughout the trial. 127 The choice 
of eligibility criteria can affect recruitment and attri-
 Trial design 
 Item 8: Description of trial design including type of 
trial (eg, parallel group, crossover, factorial, single 
group), allocation ratio, and framework (eg, superiority, 
equivalence, non-inferiority, exploratory) 
 Explanation 
 The most common design for published randomised trials 
is the parallel group, two arm, superiority trial with 1:1 allo￾cation ratio. 101 Other trial types include crossover, cluster, 
factorial, split body, and n of 1 randomised trials, as well as 
single group trials and non-randomised comparative trials. 
 For trials with more than one study group, the allocation 
ratio re1 ects the intended relative number of participants 
in each group (eg, 1:1 or 2:1). Unequal allocation ratios are 
used for a variety of reasons, including potential cost sav￾ings, allowance for learning curves, and ethical considera￾tions when the balance of existing evidence appears to be in 
favour of one intervention over the other. 102 Evidence also 
suggests a preference of some participants for enrolling in 
trials with an allocation ratio that favours allocation to an 
active treatment. 92
 
 The framework of a trial refers to its overall objective to test 
the superiority, non-inferiority, or equivalence of one inter￾vention with another, or in the case of exploratory pilot trials, 
to gather preliminary information on the intervention (eg, 
harms, pharmacokinetics) and the feasibility of conducting 
a full-scale trial. 
 It is important to specify and explain the choice of study 
design because of its close relation to the trial objectives (Item 
7) and its in1 uence on the study methods, conduct, costs, 103
results, 104-106 and interpretation. For example, factorial and 
non-inferiority trials can involve more complex methods, 
analyses, and interpretations than parallel group superior￾ity trials. 107
 
 108 In addition, the interpretation of trial results 
in published reports is not always consistent with the pre￾speci& ed trial framework, 6
 
 109
 
 110 especially among reports 
claiming post hoc equivalence based on a failure to demon￾strate superiority rather than a speci& c test of equivalence. 109
 There is increasing interest in adaptive designs for clinical 
trials, de& ned as the use of accumulating data to decide how 
to modify aspects of a study as it continues, without under￾mining the validity and integrity of the trial. 111
 
 112 Examples 
of potential adaptations include stopping the trial early, 
modifying the allocation ratio, re-estimating the sample size, 
and changing the eligibility criteria. The most valid adaptive 
designs are those in which the opportunity to make adapta￾tions is based on prespeci& ed decision rules that are fully 
documented in the protocol (Item 21b). 
 Section 3a: Methods—participants, interventions, and outcomes 
 Study setting 
 Item 9: Description of study settings (eg, community clinic, 
academic hospital) and list of countries where data will be 
collected. Reference to where list of study sites can be obtained 
 Example 
 “Selection of countries 
 . . . To detect an intervention-related difference in HIV incidences 
with the desired power, the baseline incidences at the sites must be 
sufficiently high. We chose the participating sites so that the average 
baseline annual incidence across all communities in the study is likely 
to reach at least 3%. The various sites in sub-Saharan Africa met this 
criterion, but we also wanted sites in Asia to extend the generalizability 
of the intervention. The only location in Asia with sufficient incidence 
at the community level is in ethnic minority communities in Northern 
Thailand, where HIV incidence is currently in excess of 7%;[reference] 
thus they were invited to participate as well. Our final selection of 
sites combines rural (Tanzania, Zimbabwe, Thailand, and KwaZulu￾Natal) and an urban (Soweto) location. The cultural circumstances 
between the sub-Saharan African sites vary widely . . . 
 Definition of community 
 Each of the three southern African sites (Harare, Zimbabwe; and 
Soweto and Vulindlela, South Africa) selected eight communities, 
the East African (Tanzanian) site selected 10 communities, and 
Thailand selected 14 communities . . . They are of a population size 
of approximately 10,000 . . . which fosters social familiarity and 
connectedness, and they are geographically distinct. Communities 
are defined primarily geographically for operational purposes 
for the study, taking into account these dimensions of social 
communality. The communities chosen within each country and 
site are selected to be sufficiently distant from each other so that 
there would be little cross-contamination or little possibility that 
individuals from a control community would benefit from the 
activities in the intervention community.” 113
 
 Example 
 “The PROUD trial is designed as a randomised, controlled, 
observer, surgeon and patient blinded multicenter superiority 
trial with two parallel groups and a primary endpoint of wound 
infection during 30 days after surgery . . . randomization will be 
performed as block randomization with a 1:1 allocation.” 100

policymakers, and others to fully understand, implement, 
or evaluate the trial intervention. 148 This principle applies to 
all types of interventions, but is particularly true for complex 
interventions (eg, health service delivery; psychotherapy), 
which consist of interconnected components that can vary 
between healthcare providers and settings. 
 For drugs, biological agents, or placebos, the protocol 
description should include the generic name, manufacturer, 
constituent components, route of administration, and dosing 
schedule (including titration and run-in periods, if applica￾ble). 149
 
 150 The description of non-drug interventions—such as 
devices, procedures, policies, models of care, or counselling—
is generally more complex and warrants additional details 
about the setting (Item 9) and individuals administering the 
interventions. For example, the level of pre-trial expertise 
(Item 10) and speci& c training of individuals administering 
these complex interventions are o# en relevant to describe 
(eg, for surgeons, psychologists, physiotherapists). When 
intervention delivery is subject to variation, it is important to 
state whether the same individuals will deliver the trial inter￾ventions in all study groups, or whether di" erent individuals 
will manage each study group—in which case it can be dif-
& cult to separate the e" ect of the intervention from that of the 
individual delivering it. Interventions that consist of “usual 
care” or “standard of care” require further elaboration in the 
protocol, as this care can vary substantially across centres and 
patients, as well as over the duration of the trial. 
 Interventions—modifications 
 Item 11b: Criteria for discontinuing or modifying 
allocated interventions for a given trial participant (eg, 
drug dose change in response to harms, participant 
request, or improving/worsening disease) 
 Explanation 
 For a given trial participant, the assigned study inter￾vention may need to be modified or discontinued by 
tion, 67
 
 114
 
 115
 
 117
 
 118
 
 128- 130 as well as outcome event rates. 39
 
 131
In addition, the criteria convey key information related to 
external validity (generalisability or applicability). 132 The 
importance of transparent documentation is highlighted by 
evidence that the eligibility criteria listed in publications are 
o# en di" erent from those speci& ed in the protocol. 125
 
 133
 
 134
 Certain eligibility criteria warrant explicit justi& cation in 
the protocol, particularly when they limit the trial sample 
to a narrow subset of the population. 132
 
 135
 
 136 The appro￾priateness of restrictive participant selection depends on 
the trial objectives. 137 When trial participants di" er sub￾stantially from the overall population to whom the inter￾vention will be applied, the trial results may not re1 ect the 
impact in real world practice settings. 134

 Interventions 
 Item 11a: Interventions for each group with sufficient 
detail to allow replication, including how and when they

 Studies of trials and systematic reviews have shown that 
important elements of the interventions are not described 
in half of the publications. 146
 
 147 If such elements are also 
missing from the protocol, or if the protocol simply refers to 
other documents that are not freely accessible, then it can be 
impossible for healthcare providers, systematic reviewers, 
 Examples 
 “Patients (or a representative) must provide written, informed consent before any study procedures 
occur (see Appendix 1 for sample Informed Consent Form) . . . 
 5.1. Inclusion Criteria 
 Patients eligible for the trial must comply with all of the following at randomization : 
 1. Age ≥16 years 
 2. Current admission under the care of the heart-failure service at the site 
 . . . 
 5.2. Exclusion Criteria 
 1. Acute decompensation thought by the attending heart-failure physician to require or be likely to 
require PAC [pulmonary-artery catheter] during the next 24 hours. Such patients should be entered 
into the PAC Registry (see below). 
 2. Inability to undergo PAC placement within the next 12 hours 
 . . . 
Patients enrolled in other investigational drug studies are potential candidates for ESCAPE .
As the ESCAPE protocol does not involve any investigational agents or techniques, patients would be 
eligible for dual randomization if they are on stable doses of the investigational drugs. . . . 
 13. Study Network, Training, and Responsibilities 
 . . . To qualify, physicians responsible for PAC [pulmonary-artery catheter] placements will be required 
to show proof of insertion of ≥50 PACs in the previous year with a complication rate of <5%. Further, 
clinicians will need to show competence in the following areas to participate in the study: 1) insertion 
techniques and cardiovascular anatomy; 2) oxygen dynamics; . . . and 7) common PAC complications.
[reference] . . . we will assume basic competence in these areas after satisfactory completion of the 
PACEP [PAC educational programme] module.” 123
 
 “Trial centre requirements 
 A number of guidelines have stated thrombolysis should only be considered if the patient is admitted 
to a specialist centre with appropriate experience and expertise.[reference] Hospitals participating 
in IST-3 [third International Stroke Trial] should have an organized acute stroke service. The 
components of effective stroke unit care have been identified . . . In brief, the facilities (details of these 
requirements are specified in the separate operations manual) should include: 
• Written protocol for the acute assessment of patients with suspected acute stroke to include 
interventions to reduce time from onset to treatment. 
• Immediate access to CT [computed tomographic] or MR [magnetic resonance] brain scanning 
(preferably 24 hours a day). 
 A treatment area where thrombolysis may be administered and the patient monitored according to 
trial protocol, preferably an acute stroke unit.” 124
 
 Example 
 “Eligible patients will be randomised in equal proportions between 
IL-1ra [interleukin-1 receptor antagonist] and placebo, receiving 
either a once daily, subcutaneous (s.c.) injection of IL-1ra (dose 
100 mg per 24 h) for 14 days, or a daily s.c. injection of placebo for 
14 days . . . 
 The study drug and placebo will be provided by Amgen Inc in its 
commercially available recombinant form . . . The study drug and 
placebo will be relabelled by Amgen, in collaboration with CTEU 
[Clinical Trials and Evaluation Unit] according to MHRA [Medicines 
and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency] guidelines. 
 The first dose of IL-1ra will be given within 24 h +2 h of the positive 
Troponin. Injections will be given at a standardised time (24 ± 2 h 
after the previous dose), immediately after blood sampling. IL-1ra 
or placebo will [be] administered to the patient by the research 
nurse while the patient is in hospital. During the hospital stay, 
the patient will be taught to self-administer the injection by the 
research nurse and on discharge will continue at home. This has 
proven possible in other ACS [acute coronary syndrome] trials that 
required self injection of subcutaneous heparin [reference]. Full 
written guidance on self injection will also be provided to patients. 
If self injection is found not to be possible in an individual patient 
for unexpected reasons, an alternative method will be sought (eg 
district nurse, or attending the hospital) to try and maintain full 
compliance with scheduled study drug regimen after discharge. 
Patients will also be asked to complete a daily injection diary. All 
personnel will be blinded to the identity of the syringe contents.” 145

RESEARCH METHODS AND REPORTING
 Explanation 
 Adherence to intervention protocols refers to the degree to 
which the behaviour of trial participants corresponds to the 
intervention assigned to them. 154 Distinct but related con￾cepts include trial retention (Item 18b) and adherence to the 
follow-up protocol of procedures and assessments (Item 13). 
 On average, adherence to intervention protocols is 
higher in clinical trials than in non-research settings. 155
Although there is no consensus on the acceptable mini￾mum adherence level in clinical trials, low adherence 
can have a substantial e" ect on statistical power and 
interpretation of trial results. 156-158 Since fewer partici￾pants are receiving the full intervention as intended, 
non-adherence can reduce the contrast between study 
groups—leading to decreased study power and increased 
costs associated with recruiting larger sample sizes for 
evaluating superiority, or leading to potentially inap￾propriate conclusions of non-inferiority or equivalence. 
There is also the possibility of underestimating any e8 -
cacy and harms of the study intervention. 
 Furthermore, if adherence is a marker for general 
healthy behaviour associated with better prognosis, then 
di" erent rates of non-adherence between study groups 
can lead to a biased estimate of an intervention’s e" ect. In 
support of this “healthy adherer” e" ect, non-adherers to 
placebo in clinical studies have been found to have poorer 
clinical outcomes than adherers. 159
 To help avoid these potential detrimental e" ects of 
non-adherence, many trials implement procedures 
and strategies for monitoring and improving adher￾ence, 67
 
 156- 158 and any such plans should be described in 
the protocol. 160 Among applicable drug trials published 
in 1997-99, 47% reported monitoring the level of adher￾ence. 161 Although each of the many types of monitoring 
methods has its limitations, 157
 
 158 adherence data can 
help to inform the statistical analysis (Item 20c), trial 
interpretation, and choice of appropriate adherence strat￾egies to implement in the trial as it progresses or in future 
trials and clinical practice. 
 A variety of adherence strategies exist, 156-158 and their 
use can be tailored to the speci& c type of trial design, inter￾vention, and participant population. It may be desirable to 
select strategies that can be easily implemented in clinical 
practice, so that the level of adherence in the real world 
setting is comparable to that observed in the trial. 158
 
 Interventions—concomitant care 
 Item 11d: Relevant concomitant care and interventions 
that are permitted or prohibited during the trial 
 Explanation 
 In a controlled trial, a key goal is to have comparable 
study groups that di" er only by the intervention being 
evaluated, so that any di" erence in outcomes can be 
attributed to e" ects of the study intervention. Cointer￾vention bias can arise when the study groups receive 
di" erent concomitant care or interventions (in addition 
to the assigned trial interventions) that may a" ect trial 
outcomes. 162 To promote comparability of study groups, 
the protocol should list the relevant concomitant care and 
interventions that are allowed (including rescue interven￾tions), as well as any that are prohibited. 
trial investigators for various reasons, including harms, 
improved health status, lack of e8 cacy, and withdrawal 
of participant consent. Comparability across study 
groups can be improved, and subjectivity in care deci￾sions reduced, by de& ning standard criteria for interven￾tion modi& cations and discontinuations in the protocol. 
Regardless of any decision to modify or discontinue their 
assigned intervention, study participants should be 
retained in the trial whenever possible to enable follow￾up data collection and prevent missing data (Item 18b). 152
 Interventions—adherence 
 Item 11c: Strategies to improve adherence to intervention 
protocols, and any procedures for monitoring adherence 
(eg, drug tablet return; laboratory tests) 
 Example 
 “Gastro-Intestinal Upset 
 The tablets may be taken in two equally divided doses, if necessary, to improve gastro-intestinal 
tolerance. Should it be necessary the daily dose may be reduced by one tablet at a time to 
improve gastro-intestinal tolerance. 
 Renal Function Impairment 
 Since sodium clodronate is excreted unchanged by the kidney its use is contra-indicated in 
patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (serum creatinine greater than 2 times upper 
limit of normal range of the centre). If renal function deteriorates to this extent the trial medication 
should be withdrawn from the patient. This should be reported as an adverse event. In patients 
with normal renal function or mild renal impairment (serum creatinine less than 2 times upper 
limit of normal range of the centre) serum creatinine should be monitored during therapy. 
 Allergic Reactions 
 Allergic skin reactions have been observed in rare cases. If this is suspected withdraw the trial 
medication from the patient. This should be reported as an adverse event. 
 Biochemical Disturbances 
 Asymptomatic hypocalcaemia has been noted rarely. Temporary suspension of the trial 
medication until the serum calcium returns into the normal range is recommended. The trial 
medication can be then restarted at half the previous dose. If the situation returns withdraw the 
trial medication from the patient. This should be reported as an adverse event. . .” 151
 Example 
 “Adherence reminder sessions 
 Face-to-face adherence reminder sessions will take place at the initial product dispensing and 
each study visit thereafter. This session will include: 
• The importance of following study guidelines for adherence to once daily study product 
• Instructions about taking study pills including dose timing, storage, and importance of taking pills 
whole, and what to do in the event of a missed dose. 
• Instructions about the purpose, use, and care of the MEMS® cap [medication event monitoring 
system] and bottle 
• Notification that there will be a pill count at every study visit 
• Reinforcement that study pills may be TDF [tenofovir disproxil fumarate] or placebo 
• Importance of calling the clinic if experiencing problems possibly related to study product such as 
symptoms, lost pills or MEMS® cap. 
 Subsequent sessions will occur at the follow-up visits. Participants will be asked about any 
problems they are having taking their study pills or using the MEMS® cap. There will be brief 
discussion of reasons for missed doses and simple strategies for enhancing adherence, eg, 
linking pill taking to meals or other daily activities. Participants will have an opportunity to ask 
questions and key messages from the initial session will be reviewed as needed . . . 
 Adherence assessments 
 To enhance validity of data, multiple methods will be used to assess medication adherence 
including pill count; an electronic medication event monitoring system (MEMS® cap) [reference]; 
and ACASI [audio-computer administered interview] questionnaire items including a one month 
visual analogue scale,[reference] reasons for non-compliance, and use of the MEMS® cap. 
Participants will return the unused tablets and bottle at each follow-up visit. Unused tablets will be 
counted and recorded on the appropriate CRF [case report form]. Electronic data collected in the 
MEMS® cap will be downloaded into a designated, secure study computer.” 153

RESEARCH METHODS AND REPORTING
 Explanation 
 The trial outcomes are fundamental to study design and 
interpretation of results. For a given intervention, an out￾come can generally reflect efficacy (beneficial effect) or 
harm (adverse e" ect). The outcomes of main interest are 
designated as primary outcomes, which usually appear in the 
objectives (Item 7) and sample size calculation (Item 14). The 
remaining outcomes constitute secondary or other outcomes. 
 For each outcome, the trial protocol should de& ne four 
components: the speci& c measurement variable, which cor￾responds to the data collected directly from trial participants 
(eg, Beck Depression Inventory score, all cause mortality); 
the participant-level analysis metric, which corresponds to 
the format of the outcome data that will be used from each 
trial participant for analysis (eg, change from baseline, & nal 
value, time to event); the method of aggregation, which refers 
to the summary measure format for each study group (eg, 
mean, proportion with score > 2); and the speci& c measure￾ment time point of interest for analysis. 163
 
 It is also important to explain the rationale for the choice of 
trial outcomes. An ideal outcome is valid, reproducible, rel￾evant to the target population (eg, patients), and responsive 
to changes in the health condition being studied. 67 The use of 
a continuous versus dichotomous method of aggregation can 
a" ect study power and estimates of treatment e" ect, 164
 
 165 and 
subjective outcomes are more prone to bias from inadequate 
blinding (ascertainment bias) and allocation concealment 
(selection bias) than objective outcomes. 166
 
 167 Although 
composite outcomes increase event rates and statistical 
power, their relevance and interpretation can be unclear if 
the individual component outcomes vary greatly in event 
rates, importance to patients, or amount of missing data. 168-171
 The number of primary outcomes should be as small as 
possible. Although up to 38% of trials de& ne multiple pri￾mary outcomes, 4
 
 35
 
 163 this practice can introduce problems 
with multiplicity, selective reporting, and interpretation when 
there are inconsistent results across outcomes. Problems also 
arise when trial protocols do not designate any primary out￾comes, as seen in half (28/59) of protocols for a sample of tri￾als published from 2002-2008, 12 and in 25% of randomised 
trial protocols that received ethics approval in Denmark in 
1994-95. 4
 Furthermore, major discrepancies in the primary 
outcomes designated in protocols/registries/regulatory sub￾missions versus & nal trial publications are common; favour 
the reporting of statistically signi& cant primary outcomes 
over non-signi& cant ones; and are o# en not acknowledged 
in & nal publications. 172-176 Such bias can only be identi& ed 
and deterred if trial outcomes are clearly de& ned beforehand 
in the protocol and if protocol information is made public. 177
 Where possible, the development and adoption of a com￾mon set of key trial outcomes within a specialty can help to 
deter selective reporting of outcomes and to facilitate compari￾sons and pooling of results across trials in a meta-analysis. 178-180
The COMET (Core Outcome Measures in E" ectiveness Trials) 
Initiative aims to facilitate the development and application of 
such standardised sets of core outcomes for clinical trials of spe￾ci& c conditions ( www.comet-initiative.org ). Trial investigators 
are encouraged to ascertain whether there is a core outcome 
set relevant to their trial and, if so, to include those outcomes in 
their trial. Existence of a common set of outcomes does not pre￾clude inclusion of additional relevant outcomes for a given trial. 
 Outcomes 
 Item 12: Primary, secondary, and other outcomes, 
including the specific measurement variable (eg, systolic 
blood pressure), analysis metric (eg, change from baseline, 
final value, time to event), method of aggregation (eg, 
median, proportion), and time point for each outcome. 
Explanation of the clinical relevance of chosen efficacy and 
harm outcomes is strongly recommended 
 Example 
 “ 2. Rescue Medication 
 For weeks 0-3 , topical mometasone furoate 0.1% cream or ointment (30 g/week) will be permitted 
with participants preferably using ointment. Participants will be instructed to apply the topical 
mometasone furoate to blisters/lesions as required (not to areas of unaffected skin). If the participant 
is allergic to mometasone furoate or the hospital pharmacy does not stock it, then an alternative 
topical steroid may be prescribed but this must be in the potent class. In addition, participants will be 
advised that they can apply a light moisturiser to blisters/lesions at any time during the study. 
 For weeks 3-6 , use of mometasone furoate (or other topical corticosteroids) is strongly discouraged 
to prevent potential systemic effects. Accidental use of mometasone furoate or other potent topical 
steroid during this period will be classified as a protocol deviation. 
 After week 6 , potent topical corticosteroids (up to 30 g/week) may be used to treat symptoms 
and localised disease if they would have normally been used as part of normal clinical care by the 
physician in charge of that patient. This must be recorded on the trial treatment log. 
 However, those patients who are on a dose reducing regime for oral steroids, 30 g/week of a 
“potent” topical steroid will be allowed. 
 3. Prohibited Concomitant Medications 
 The administration of live virus vaccines is not permitted for all participants during weeks 0-6 as the 
investigator is blinded to treatment allocation, and must therefore warn all participants to refrain for 
[sic] having a live virus vaccine. However, after week 6, once the investigator knows which medication 
the participant is on, only those taking prednisolone will not be allowed live virus vaccines. 
 Participants should continue to take medications for other conditions as normal. However, if it is 
anticipated that the participant will need a live virus vaccine during the intervention phase, they will 
be ineligible for entry into the study . . .” 50
 
 Example 
 “1. Primary Outcome Measures 
• Difference between the two treatment arms in the proportion of participants classed as treatment 
success at 6 weeks. Treatment success is defined as 3 or less significant blisters present on 
examination at 6 weeks. Significant blisters are defined as intact blisters containing fluid which are at 
least 5 mm in diameter. However, if the participant has popped a blister, or the blister is at a site that 
makes it susceptible to bursting such as the sole of the foot, it can be considered part of the blister 
count, providing there is a flexible (but not dry) roof present over a moist base. Mucosal blisters will 
be excluded from the count. 
 A survey of the UK DCTN [Dermatology Clinical Trials Network] membership showed that a point estimate 
of 25% inferiority in effectiveness would be acceptable assuming a gain in the safety profile of at least 10%. 
• This measure of success was selected as it was considered to be more clinically relevant than a 
continuous measure of blister count. It would be less clinically relevant to perform an absolute blister 
count and report a percentage reduction. Instead, to state that treatment is considered a success if 
remission is achieved (ie the presence of three or less blisters on physical examination at 6 weeks) 
more closely reflects clinical practice. In addition, it is far less burdensome on investigators than 
including a full blister count, which would mean counting in the region of 50-60 blisters in many 
cases. This outcome measure will be performed as a single blind assessment. 
• Difference between the two treatment arms in the proportion of participants reporting grade 3, 4 
and 5 (mortality) adverse events which are possibly, probably or definitely related to BP [bullous 
pemphigoid] medication in the 52 weeks following randomisation. A modified version of The 
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v3.0) will be used to grade adverse events. 
At each study visit, participants will be questioned about adverse events they have experienced since 
the last study visit (using a standard list of known side effects of the two study drugs). 
 2. Secondary Outcome Measures 
 For the secondary and tertiary endpoints a participant will be classed as a treatment success if they have 3 
or less significant blisters present on examination and have not had their treatment modified (changed or 
dose increased) on account of a poor response. 
• Difference in the proportion of participants who are classed as a treatment success at 6 weeks. 
• Difference in the proportion of participants in each treatment arm who are classed as treatment 
success at 6 weeks and are alive at 52 weeks. This measure will provide a good overall comparison of 
the two treatment arms.” 50

RESEARCH METHODS AND REPORTING
 Explanation 
 A clear and concise timeline of the study visits, enrolment 
process, interventions, and assessments performed on 
participants can help to guide trial conduct and enable 
external review of participant burden and feasibility. 
These factors can also a" ect the decision of potential 
investigators and participants to join the trial (Item 15). 91
 A schematic diagram is highly recommended to e8 ciently 
present the overall schedule and time commitment for trial 
participants in each study group. Though various presenta￾tion formats exist, key information to convey includes the 
timing of each visit, starting from initial eligibility screen￾ing through to study close-out; time periods during which 
trial interventions will be administered; and the procedures 
and assessments performed at each visit (with reference to 
speci& c data collection forms, if relevant) (& g 1). 
 Sample size 
 Item 14: Estimated number of participants needed to 
achieve study objectives and how it was determined, 
including clinical and statistical assumptions supporting 
any sample size calculations 
 Explanation 
 The planned number of trial participants is a key aspect of 
study design, budgeting, and feasibility that is usually deter￾mined using a formal sample size calculation. If the planned 
sample size is not derived statistically, then this should be 
explicitly stated along with a rationale for the intended sam￾ple size (eg, exploratory nature of pilot studies; pragmatic 
considerations for trials in rare diseases). 17
 
 184
 
 For trials that involve a formal sample size calculation, 
the guiding principle is that the planned sample size should 
be large enough to have a high probability (power) of detect￾ing a true e" ect of a given magnitude, should it exist. Sam￾ple size calculations are generally based on one primary 
outcome; however, it may also be worthwhile to plan for 
adequate study power or report the power that will be avail￾able (given the proposed sample size) for other important 
outcomes or analyses because trials are o# en underpowered 
to detect harms or subgroup e" ects. 185
 
 186
 
 Among randomised trial protocols that describe a sample 
size calculation, 4-40% do not state all components of the 
calculation. 6
 
 11 The protocol should generally include the 
following: the outcome (Item 12); the values assumed for 
the outcome in each study group (eg, proportion with event, 
or mean and standard deviation) (table 4); the statistical test 
(Item 20a); alpha (type 1 error) level; power; and the calcu￾lated sample size per group—both assuming no loss of data 
and, if relevant, a# er any in1 ation for anticipated missing 
data (Item 20c). Trial investigators are also encouraged

 “The sample size was calculated on the basis of the 
primary hypothesis. In the exploratory study,[reference] 
those referred to PEPS [psychoeducation with problem 
solving] had a greater improvement in social functioning 
at 6 month follow-up equivalent to 1.05 points on the 
SFQ [Social Functioning Questionnaire]. However, a 
number of people received PEPS who were not included 
in the trial (eg, the wait-list control) and, for this larger 
sample (N=93), the mean pre-post- treatment difference 
was 1.79 (pre-treatment mean=13.85, SD=4.21; 
post-treatment mean=12.06, SD=4.21). (Note: a lower 
SFQ score is more desirable). This difference of almost 
2 points accords with other evidence that this is a 
clinically significant and important difference.[reference] 
A reduction of 2 points or more on the SFQ at 1 year 
follow-up in an RCT of cognitive behaviour therapy in 
health anxiety was associated with a halving of secondary 
care appointments (1.24.vs 0.65), a clinically significant 
reduction in the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale 
(HADS[reference]) Anxiety score of 2.5 (9.9 vs 7.45) 
and a reduction in health anxiety (the main outcome) 
of 5.6 points (17.8 vs 12.2) (11 is a normal population 
score and 18 is pathological).[reference] These findings 
suggest that improvements in social functioning may 
accrue over 1 year, hence we expect to find a greater 
magnitude of response at the 72 week follow-up than we 
did in the exploratory trial. Therefore, we have powered 
this trial to be able to detect a difference in SFQ score of 2 
points. SFQ standard deviations vary between treatment, 
control, and the wait-list samples, ranging from 3.78 to 
4.53. We have based our sample size estimate on the 
most conservative (ie, largest) SD [standard deviation]. 
To detect a mean difference in SFQ score of 2 point (SD = 
4.53) at 72 weeks with a two-sided significance level of 
1% and power of 80% with equal allocation to two arms 
would require 120 patients in each arm of the trial. To 
allow for 30% drop out, 170 will be recruited per arm, ie, 
340 in total.” 183
 
 “Superficial and deep incisional surgical site infection 
rates for patients in the PDS II® [polydioxanone suture] 
group are estimated to occur at a rate of 0.12.[reference] 
The trials by [reference] have shown a reduction of SSI 
[surgical site infections] of more than 50% (from 10.8% 
to 4.9% and from 9.2% to 4.3% respectively). Therefore, 
we estimate a rate of 0.06 for PDS Plus® [triclosan￾coated continuous polydioxanone suture]. 
 For a fixed sample size design, the sample size 
required to achieve a power of 1-β=0.80 for the 
one-sided chi-square test at level α=0.025 under 
these assumptions amounts to 2×356=712 (nQuery 
Advisor®, version 7.0). It can be expected that including 
covariates of prognostic importance in the logistic 
regression model as defined for the confirmatory 
analysis will increase the power as compared to the 
chi-square test. As the individual results for the primary 
endpoint are available within 30 days after surgery, the 
drop-out rate is expected to be small. Nevertheless, 
a potential dilution of the treatment effect due to 
drop-outs is taken into account (eg no photographs 
available, loss to follow up); it is assumed that this 
can be compensated by additional 5% of patients to 
be randomized, and therefore the total sample size 
required for a fixed sample size design amounts to 
n=712+38=750 patients. 
 . . . 
 An adaptive interim analysis [reference] will be 
performed after availability of the results for the 
primary endpoint for a total of 375 randomized 
patients (ie, 50% of the number of patients required in 
a fixed sample size design). The following type I error 
rates and decision boundaries for the interim and the 
final analysis are specified: 
 • Overall one-sided type I error rate: 0.025 
 • Boundary for the one-sided p-value of the first stage 
for accepting the null-hypothesis within the interim 
analysis: α 0
 =0.5 
 • One-sided local type I error rate for testing the null￾hypothesis within the interim analysis: α 1
 =0.0102 
 • Boundary for the product of the one-sided p-values of 
both stages for the rejection of the null-hypothesis in the 
final analysis: cα=0.0038 
 If the trial will be continued with a second stage after 
the interim analysis (this is possible if for the one-sided 
p-value p 1
 of the interim analysis p 1∈]0.0102,0.5[ [ie 
0.5≥P 1
 ≥0.0102] holds true, the results of the interim 
analysis can be taken into account for a recalculation of 
the required sample size. If the sample size recalculation 
leads to the conclusion that more than 1200 patients 
are required, the study is stopped, because the related 
treatment group difference is judged to be of minor 
clinical importance. 
 . . . 
 The actually achieved sample size is then not fixed but 
random, and a variety of scenarios can be considered. 
If the sample size is calculated under the same 
assumptions with respect to the SSI rates for the two 
groups, applying the same the overall significance level 
of α=0.025 (one-sided) but employing additionally 
the defined stopping boundaries and recalculating the 
sample size for the second stage at a conditional power 
of 80% on the basis of the SSI rates observed in the 
interim analysis results in an average total sample size 
of n=766 patients; the overall power of the study is then 
90% (ADDPLAN®, version 5.0).” 100

assumed for each study group. 187 The values of certain pre￾speci& ed variables tend to be inappropriately in1 ated (eg, 
clinically important treatment e" ect size) 188
 
 189 or underes￾timated (eg, standard deviation for continuous outcomes), 190
leading to trials having less power in the end than what was 
originally calculated. Finally, when uncertainty of a sam￾ple size estimate is acknowledged, methods exist for re￾estimating sample size. 191 The intended use of such an adap￾tive design approach should be stated in the protocol. 
 For designs and frameworks other than parallel group 
superiority trials, additional elements are required in the 
sample size calculation. For example, an estimate of the 
standard deviation of within-person changes from baseline 
should be included for crossover trials 192 ; the intracluster 
correlation coe8 cient for cluster randomised trials 193 ; and 
the equivalence or non-inferiority margin for equivalence 
or non-inferiority trials respectively. 108

 Recruitment 
 Item 15: Strategies for achieving adequate participant 
enrolment to reach target sample size 
 Explanation 
 The main goal of recruitment is to meet the target sam￾ple size (Item 14). However, recruitment di8 culties are 
commonly encountered in clinical trials. 209-213 For exam￾ple, reviews of government funded trials in the US and 
UK found that two thirds did not reach their recruitment 
targets. 214
 
 215 Low enrolment will reduce statistical power 
and can lead to early trial stoppage or to extensions with 
delayed results and greater costs. 
 Strategies to promote adequate enrolment are thus impor￾tant to consider during trial planning. Recruitment strate￾gies can vary depending on the trial topic, context, and site. 
Di" erent recruitment methods can substantially a" ect the 
number and type of trial participants recruited 128
 
 209
 
 216- 220
and can incur di" erent costs. 221-223 Design issues such as the 
number and stringency of eligibility criteria will also directly 
a" ect the number of eligible trial participants. 
 Protocol descriptions of where participants will be 
recruited (eg, primary care clinic, community), by whom 
(eg, surgeon), when (eg, time a# er diagnosis), and how (eg, 
advertisements, review of health records) can be helpful 
for assessing the feasibility of achieving the target sample 
size and the applicability of the trial results in practice. 
Other relevant information to explicitly provide in the 
protocol includes expected recruitment rates, duration of 
the recruitment period, plans to monitor recruitment dur￾ing the trial, and any & nancial or non-& nancial incentives 
provided to trial investigators or participants for enrolment 
(Item 4). If strategies di" er by site in m ulticentre trials, 
these should be detailed to the extent possible. 
 Example 
 “Each center will screen subjects to achieve screening percentages 
of 50% women and 33% minority; screening will continue until 
the target population is achieved (12 subjects/site). We recognize 
that, because of exclusion by genotype and genotypic variation 
among diverse populations,[reference], the enrolled cohort may 
not reflect the screened population. The enrollment period will 
extend over 12 months. 
Recruitment Strategy
Each clinical center involved in the ACRN [Asthma Clinical Research 
Network] was chosen based on documentation for patient 
availability, among other things. It is, however, worthy to note the 
specific plans of each center.
. . . The Asthma Clinical Research Center at the Brigham & Women’s 
Hospital utilizes three primary resources for identifying and 
recruiting potential subjects as described below.
1. Research Patient Database
The Asthma Clinical Research Center at the Brigham and Women’s 
Hospital has a database of over 1,500 asthmatics . . .
2. Asthma Patient Lists . . .
3. Advertisements . . .
. . . the Madison ACRN site has utilized some additional approaches 
to target minority recruitment. We have utilized a marketing expert 
to coordinate and oversee our overall efforts in recruiting and 
retaining minorities. . . . As a result of his efforts, we have advertised 
widely in newspapers and other publications that target ethnic 
minorities, established contacts with various ethnic community, 
university, church, and business groups, and conducted 
community-based asthma programs . . . For example, student 
groups such as AHANA (a pre-health careers organization focusing 
on minority concerns) will be contacted. . . . In addition, we will 
utilize published examples of successful retention strategies such 
as frequent payment of subject honoraria as study landmarks are 
achieved and study participant group social events. Study visits 
will be carefully planned and scheduled to avoid exam-time and 
university calendar breaks . . .
The Harlem Hospital Center Emergency Department (ED) sees an 
average of eight adult patients per day for asthma. Through the 
REACH (Reducing Emergency Asthma Care in Harlem) project, we 
have . . . successfully recruited and interviewed 380 patients from 
the ED . . .
Responses to inquiries about participation in research studies 
are answered by a dedicated phone line that is manned during 
business hours and answered by voicemail at all other times. A 
research assistant responds to each inquiry immediately, using a 
screening instrument . . .
Patients are recruited for clinical trials at the Jefferson Center through 
two primary mechanisms: (1) local advertising; and (2) identification 
in the asthma patient registry (database). Local advertising takes 
advantage of the printed as well as the audio-visual media. Printed 
media include . . . All advertising in the printed and audio-visual 
media has prior approval of the Institutional Review Board.
The Jefferson patient registry (database) has been maintained 
since 1992 and currently contains 3,100 patients . . . It is estimated 
that 300-400 new asthmatic patients are seen each year, while 
a smaller number become inactive due to relocation, change of 
health care provider, etc. Once identified in the database, patients 
potentially eligible for a specific study are contacted by the nurse 
coordinator who explains the study and ascertains the patient’s 
interest. If interested, the patient is seen in the clinical research 
laboratories where more detailed evaluations are made . . .
Each subject will receive financial compensation within FDA 
[Food and Drug Administration] guidelines for participation in an 
amount determined by the local center. For subjects who drop out, 
payments will be pro-rated for the length of time they stayed in the 
study, but payment will not be made until the study would have 
been completed had the subject not dropped out.”208

as these terms have been used inappropriately to describe 
non-random, deterministic allocation methods such as 
alternation or allocation by date of birth. 121 In general, 
these non-random allocation methods introduce selec￾tion bias and biased estimates of an intervention’s e" ect 
size, 17
 
 167
 
 228
 
 229 mainly due to the lack of allocation con￾cealment (Item 16b). If non-random allocation is planned, 
then the speci& c method and rationale should be stated. 
 Box 1 outlines the key elements of the random sequence 
that should be detailed in the protocol. Three quarters of 
randomised trial protocols approved by a research ethics 
committee in Denmark (1994-95) or conducted by a US 
cooperative cancer research group (1968-2006) did not 
describe the method of sequence generation. 2

 Section 3b: Methods—assignment of interventions (for 
controlled trials) 
 Allocation—sequence generation 
 Item 16a: Method of generating the allocation sequence 
(eg, computer-generated random numbers) and list of any 
factors for stratification. To reduce predictability of a random 
sequence, details of any planned restriction (eg, blocking) 
should be provided in a separate document that is unavailable 
to those who enrol participants or assign interventions 
 Explanation 
 Participants in a randomised trial should be assigned to 
study groups using a random (chance) process character￾ised by unpredictability of assignments. Randomisation 
decreases selection bias in allocation; helps to facilitate 
blinding/masking a# er allocation; and enables the use of 
probability theory to test whether any di" erence in out￾come between intervention groups re1 ects chance. 17
 
 225- 227
 Use of terms such as “randomisation” without further elab￾oration is not su8 cient to describe the allocation process, 
 Box 1 | Key elements of random sequence to specify in trial 
protocols 
• Method of sequence generation (eg, random number table or 
computerised random number generator) 
• Allocation ratio (Item 8) (eg, whether participants are allocated 
with equal or unequal probabilities to interventions) 
• Type of randomisation (box 2): simple versus restricted; fixed 
versus adaptive (eg, minimisation); and, where relevant, the 
reasons for such choices 
• If applicable, the factors (eg, recruitment site, sex, disease stage) 
to be used for stratification (box 2), including categories and 
relevant cut-off boundaries 
 Simple randomisation 
 Randomisation based solely on a single, constant allocation 
ratio is known as simple randomisation. Simple randomisation 
with a 1:1 allocation ratio is analogous to a coin toss, although 
tossing a coin is not recommended for sequence generation. 
No other allocation approach, regardless of its real or 
supposed sophistication, surpasses the bias prevention and 
unpredictability of simple randomisation. 231
 Restricted randomisation 
 Any randomised approach that is not simple randomisation is 
restricted. Blocked randomisation is the most common form. 
Other forms, used much less frequently, are methods such as 
replacement randomisation, biased coin, and urn randomisation. 231
 Blocked randomisation 
 Blocked randomisation (also called permuted block randomisation) 
assures that study groups of approximately the same size will be 
generated when an allocation ratio of 1:1 is used. Blocking can 
also ensure close balance of the numbers in each group at any time 
during the trial. After every block of eight participants, for example, 
four would have been allocated to each trial group. 232 Improved 
balance comes at the cost of reducing the unpredictability of the 
sequence. Although the order of interventions varies randomly 
within each block, a person running the trial could deduce some of 
the next treatment allocations if they discovered the block size. 233
 
Blinding the interventions, using larger block sizes, and randomly 
varying the block size will help to avoid this problem. 
 Biased coin and urn randomisation 
 Biased coin designs attain the similar objective as blocked designs 
without forcing strict equality. They therefore preserve much of the 
unpredictability associated with simple randomisation. Biased-coin 
designs alter the allocation ratio during the course of the trial to rectify 
imbalances that might be occurring. 231 Adaptive biased-coin designs, 
such as the urn design, vary allocation ratios based on the magnitude 
of the imbalance. However, these approaches are used infrequently. 
 Stratified randomisation 
 Stratification is used to ensure good balance of participant 
characteristics in each group. Without stratification, study groups 
may not be well matched for baseline characteristics, such as age 
and stage of disease, especially in small trials. Such imbalances can 
be avoided without sacrificing the advantages of randomisation. 
Stratified randomisation is achieved by performing a separate 
randomisation procedure within each of two or more strata of 
participants (eg, categories of age or baseline disease severity), 
ensuring that the numbers of participants receiving each intervention 
are closely balanced within each stratum. Stratification requires some 
form of restriction (eg, blocking within strata) in order to be effective. 
The number of strata should be limited to avoid over-stratification. 234
 
Stratification by centre is common in multicentre trials. 
 Minimisation 
 Minimisation assures similar distribution of selected participant 
factors between study groups. 230
 
 235 Randomisation lists are not set 
up in advance. The first participant is truly randomly allocated; for 
each subsequent participant, the treatment allocation that minimises 
the imbalance on the selected factors between groups at that time is 
identified. That allocation may then be used, or a choice may be made 
at random with a heavy weighting in favour of the intervention that 
would minimise imbalance (for example, with a probability of 0.8). The 
use of a random component is generally preferable. 236 Minimisation 
has the advantage of making small groups closely similar in terms of 
participant characteristics at all stages of the trial. 
 Minimisation offers the only acceptable alternative to 
randomisation, and some have argued that it is superior. 237 On the 
other hand, minimisation lacks the theoretical basis for eliminating 
bias on all known and unknown factors. Nevertheless, in general, trials 
that use minimisation are considered methodologically equivalent to 
randomised trials, even when a random element is not incorporated. 
For SPIRIT, minimisation is considered a restricted randomisation 
approach without any judgment as to whether it is superior or inferior 
compared to other restricted randomisation approaches.

 Example 
 “Participants will be randomly assigned to either control or 
experimental group with a 1:1 allocation as per a computer 
generated randomisation schedule stratified by site and the 
baseline score of the Action Arm Research Test (ARAT; <=21 
versus >21) using permuted blocks of random sizes. The block 
sizes will not be disclosed, to ensure concealment.” 224

to provide informed consent, or a recruiter’s decision to 
enrol a participant, is not in1 uenced by knowledge of the 
group to which they will be allocated if they join the trial. 242
Allocation concealment should not be confused with blind￾ing (masking) (Item 17) (table 5). 243
 
 Without adequate allocation concealment, even ran￾dom, unpredictable assignment sequences can be sub￾verted. 233
 
 241 For example, a common practice is to enclose 
assignments in sequentially numbered, sealed envelopes. 
However, if the envelopes are not opaque and contents are 
visible when held up to a light source, or if the envelopes 
can be unsealed and resealed, then this method of alloca￾tion concealment can be corrupted. 
 Protocols should describe the planned allocation 
concealment mechanism in sufficient detail to enable 
assessment of its adequacy. In one study of randomised 
trial protocols in Denmark, over half did not adequately 
describe allocation concealment methods. 2
 In contrast, 
central randomisation was stated as the allocation con￾cealment method in all phase III trial protocols initiated 
in 1968-2003 by a cooperative cancer research group that 
used extensive protocol review processes. 11 Like sequence 
generation, inadequate reporting of allocation conceal￾ment in trial publications is common and has been asso￾ciated with in1 ated e" ect size estimates. 167

 Allocation—implementation 
 Item 16c: Who will generate the allocation sequence, who 
will enrol participants, and who will assign participants 
to interventions 
 Explanation 
 Based on the risk of bias associated with some methods 
of sequence generation and inadequate allocation con￾cealment, trial investigators should strive for complete 
separation of the individuals involved in the steps before 
enrolment (sequence generation process and allocation 
concealment mechanism) from those involved in the imple￾mentation of study group assignments. When this separa￾tion is not possible, it is important for the investigators to 
 Box 2 de& nes the various types of randomisation, includ￾ing minimisation. When restricted randomisation is used, 
certain details should not appear in the protocol in order 
to reduce predictability of the random sequence (box 3). 
The details should instead be described in a separate docu￾ment that is unavailable to trial implementers. For blocked 
randomisation, this information would include details on 
how the blocks will be generated (eg, permuted blocks by 
a computer random number generator), the block size(s), 
and whether the block size will be & xed or randomly var￾ied. Specific block size was provided in 14/102 (14%) 
randomised trial protocols approved by a Danish research 
ethics committee in 1994-95, potentially compromising 
allocation concealment. 2
 For trials using minimisation, it 
is also important to state the details in a separate document, 
including whether random elements will be used. 
 Allocation—concealment mechanism 
 Item 16b: Mechanism of implementing the allocation 
sequence (eg, central telephone; sequentially numbered, 
opaque, sealed envelopes), describing any steps to 
conceal the sequence until interventions are assigned 
 Explanation 
 Successful randomisation in practice depends on two 
interrelated aspects: 1) generation of an unpredictable 
allocation sequence (Item 16a) and 2) concealment of 
that sequence until assignment irreversibly occurs. 233
 
 241
The allocation concealment mechanism aims to prevent 
participants and recruiters from knowing the study group 
to which the next participant will be assigned. Allocation 
concealment helps to ensure that a participant’s decision 
 Box 3 | Need for a separate document to describe restricted randomisation 
 If some type of restricted randomisation approach is to be used, in particular blocked randomisation 
or minimisation, then the knowledge of the specific details could lead to bias. 238
 
 239 For example, 
if the trial protocol for a two arm, parallel group trial with a 1:1 allocation ratio states that blocked 
randomisation will be used and the block size will be six, then trial implementers know that the 
intervention assignments will balance every six participants. Thus, if intervention assignments 
become known after assignment, knowing the block size will allow trial implementers to predict 
when equality of the sample sizes will arise. A sequence can be discerned from the pattern of past 
assignments and then some future assignments could be accurately predicted. For example, if part of 
a sequence contained two “As” and three “Bs,” trial implementers would know the last assignment in 
the sequence would be an “A.” If the first three assignments in a sequence contained three “As,” trial 
implementers would know the last three assignments in that sequence would be three “Bs.” Selection 
bias could result, regardless of the effectiveness of allocation concealment (Item 16b). 
 Of course, this is mainly a problem in open label trials, where everyone becomes aware of the 
intervention after assignment. It can also be a problem in trials where everyone is supposedly blinded 
(masked), but the blinding is ineffective or the intervention harms provide clues such that treatments 
can be guessed. 
 We recommend that trial investigators do not provide full details of a restricted randomisation 
scheme (including minimisation) in the trial protocol. Knowledge of these details might undermine 
randomisation by facilitating deciphering of the allocation sequence. Instead, this specific 
information should be provided in a separate document with restricted access. However, simple 
randomisation procedures could be reported in detail in the protocol, because simple randomisation 
is totally unpredictable. 
 Example 
 “Participants will be randomised using TENALEA, which is an 
online, central randomisation service . . . Allocation concealment 
will be ensured, as the service will not release the randomisation 
code until the patient has been recruited into the trial, which takes 
place after all baseline measurements have been completed.” 240

tees (Item 5d), data analysts, 253 and manuscript writers. 
Blinding of data monitoring committees is generally dis￾couraged. 254
 
 255
 
 When blinding of trial participants and care providers 
is not possible because of obvious di" erences between the 
interventions, 256
 
 257 blinding of the outcome assessors can 
o# en still be implemented. 17 It may also be possible to blind 
participants or trial personnel to the study hypothesis in 
terms of which intervention is considered active. For exam￾ple, in a trial evaluating light therapy for depression, par￾ticipants were informed that the study involved testing two 
di" erent forms of light therapy, whereas the true hypothesis 
was that bright blue light was considered potentially e" ec￾tive and that dim red light was considered placebo. 258
 
 Despite its importance, blinding is often poorly 
described in trial protocols. 3
 The protocol should explicitly 
state who will be blinded to intervention groups—at a mini￾mum, the blinding status of trial participants, care provid￾ers, and outcome assessors. Such a description is much 
preferred over the use of ambiguous terminology such as 
“single blind” or “double blind.” 259
 
 260 Protocols should 
also describe the comparability of blinded interventions 
(Item 11a) 150 —for example, similarities in appearance, use 
of speci& c 1 avours to mask a distinctive taste—and the tim￾ing of & nal unblinding of all trial participants (eg, a# er the 
creation of a locked analysis data set). 3
 
 Furthermore, any strategies to reduce the potential for 
unblinding should be described in the protocol, such as pre￾trial testing of blinding procedures. 261 The use of a & xed code 
(versus a unique code for each participant) to denote each 
study group assignment (eg, A=Group 1; B=Group 2) can be 
problematic, as the unblinding of one participant will result 
in the inadvertent loss of blinding for all trial participants. 
 Some have suggested that the success of blinding be for￾mally tested by asking key trial persons to guess the study 
group assignment and comparing these responses to what 
would be expected by chance. 262 However, it is unclear how 
best to interpret the results of such tests. 263
 
 264 If done, the 
planned testing methods should be described in the trial 
protocol. 
 Blinding (masking)—emergency unblinding 
 Item 17b: If blinded, circumstances under which 
unblinding is permissible and procedure for revealing a 
participant’s allocated intervention during the trial 
 Explanation 
 Among 58 blinded Danish trials approved in 1994-95, 
three quarters of protocols described emergency unblind￾ing procedures. 3
 Such procedures to reveal the assigned 
intervention in certain circumstances are intended to 
increase the safety of trial participants by informing the 
clinical management of harms or other relevant conditions 
that arise. A clear protocol description of the conditions 
and procedures for emergency unblinding helps to pre￾vent unnecessary unblinding; facilitates implementation 
by trial personnel when indicated; and enables evalua￾tion of the appropriateness of the planned procedures. In 
some cases (eg, minor, reversible harms), stopping and 
then cautiously reintroducing the assigned intervention 
in the a" ected participant can avoid both unblinding and 
further harm. 
ensure that the assignment schedule is unpredictable and 
locked away from even the person who generated it. The 
protocol should specify who will implement the various 
stages of the randomisation process, how and where the 
allocation list will be stored, and mechanisms employed to 
minimise the possibility that those enrolling and assigning 
participants will obtain access to the list. 
 Blinding (masking) 
 Item 17a: Who will be blinded after assignment to 
interventions (eg, trial participants, care providers, 
outcome assessors, data analysts) and how 
 Explanation 
 Blinding or masking (the process of keeping the study group 
assignment hidden a# er allocation) is commonly used to 
reduce the risk of bias in clinical trials with two or more study 
groups. 166
 
 248 Awareness of the intervention assigned to par￾ticipants can introduce ascertainment bias in the measure￾ment of outcomes, particularly subjective ones (eg, quality 
of life) 166
 
 167 ; performance bias in the decision to discontinue 
or modify study interventions (eg, dosing changes) (Item 
11b), concomitant interventions, or other aspects of care 
(Item 11d) 229 ; and exclusion/attrition bias in the decision 
to withdraw from the trial or to exclude a participant from 
the analysis. 249
 
 250 We have elected to use the term “blind￾ing” but acknowledge that others prefer the term “masking” 
because “blind” also relates to an ophthalmological condi￾tion and health outcome. 251
 
 252
 
 Many groups can be blinded: trial participants, care 
providers, data collectors, outcome assessors or commit-
 Example 
 “Randomization 
 All patients who give consent for participation and who fulfil the inclusion criteria will be randomized. 
Randomisation will be requested by the staff member responsible for recruitment and clinical 
interviews from CenTrial [Coordination Centre of Clinical Trials]. 
 In return, CenTrial will send an answer form to the study therapist who is not involved in assessing 
outcome of the study. This form will include a randomisation number. In every centre closed envelopes 
with printed randomisation numbers on it are available. For every randomisation number the 
corresponding code for the therapy group of the randomisation list will be found inside the envelopes. 
The therapist will open the envelope and will find the treatment condition to be conducted in this patient. 
The therapist then gives the information about treatment allocation to the patient. Staff responsible for 
recruitment and symptom ratings is not allowed to receive information about the group allocation. 
 . . . 
 The allocation sequence will be generated by the Institute for Medical Biometry (IMB) applying a 
permuted block design with random blocks stratified by study centre and medication compliance 
(favourable vs. unfavourable). . . . The block size will be concealed until the primary endpoint will be 
analysed. Throughout the study, the randomisation will be conducted by CenTrial in order to keep the 
data management and the statistician blind against the study condition as long as the data bank is open. 
The randomisation list remains with CenTrial for the whole duration of the study. Thus, randomisation 
will be conducted without any influence of the principal investigators, raters or therapists.” 246
 
 Example 
 “Assessments regarding clinical recovery will be conducted 
by an assessor blind to treatment allocation. The assessor will 
go through a profound assessment training program . . . Due 
to the nature of the intervention neither participants nor staff 
can be blinded to allocation, but are strongly inculcated not to 
disclose the allocation status of the participant at the follow 
up assessments. An employee outside the research team will 
feed data into the computer in separate datasheets so that 
the researchers can analyse data without having access to 
information about the allocation.” 247

reliability and validity, if known. Reference to where data 
collection forms can be found, if not in the protocol 
 Explanation 
 The validity and reliability of trial data depend on the quality 
of the data collection methods. The processes of acquiring 
and recording data o# en bene& t from attention to training of 
study personnel and use of standardised, pilot tested meth￾ods. These should be identical for all study groups, unless 
precluded by the nature of the intervention. 
 The choice of methods for outcome assessment can a" ect 
study conduct and results. 268-273 Substantially differ￾ent responses can be obtained for certain outcomes (eg, 
harms) depending on who answers the questions (eg, the 
participant or investigator) and how the questions are pre￾sented (eg, discrete options or open ended). 269
 
 274- 276 Also, 
when compared to paper based data collection, the use of 
electronic handheld devices and internet websites has the 
potential to improve protocol adherence, data accuracy, user 
acceptability, and timeliness of receiving data. 268
 
 270
 
 271
 
 277
 
 The quality of data also depends on the reliability, valid￾ity, and responsiveness of data collection instruments 
such as questionnaires 278 or laboratory instruments. 
Instruments with low inter-rater reliability will reduce

 Item 18a: Plans for assessment and collection of outcome, 
baseline, and other trial data, including any related processes 
to promote data quality (eg, duplicate measurements, 
training of assessors) and a description of study instruments 
(eg, questionnaires, laboratory tests) along with their 
 Example 
 “To maintain the overall quality and legitimacy of the clinical trial, code breaks should occur only in 
exceptional circumstances when knowledge of the actual treatment is absolutely essential for further 
management of the patient. Investigators are encouraged to discuss with the Medical Advisor or PHRI 
[Population Health Research Institute] physician if he/she believes that unblinding is necessary. 
 If unblinding is deemed to be necessary, the investigator should use the system for emergency 
unblinding through the PHRI toll-free help line as the main system or through the local emergency 
number as the back-up system. 
 The Investigator is encouraged to maintain the blind as far as possible. The actual allocation 
must NOT be disclosed to the patient and/or other study personnel including other site personnel, 
monitors, corporate sponsors or project office staff; nor should there be any written or verbal 
disclosure of the code in any of the corresponding patient documents. 
 The Investigator must report all code breaks (with reason) as they occur on the corresponding CRF 
[case report form] page. 
 Unblinding should not necessarily be a reason for study drug discontinuation.” 265
 
 “Primary outcome 
Delirium recognition : In accordance with national 
guidelines [reference], the study will identify delirium 
by using the RASS [Richmond Agitation-Sedation 
Scale] and the CAM-ICU [Confusion Assessment 
Method for the intensive care unit] on all patients 
who are admitted directly from the emergency 
room or transferred from other services to the 
ICU. Such assessment will be performed after 
24 hours of ICU admission and twice daily until 
discharge from the hospital . . . RASS has excellent 
inter-rater reliability among adult medical and 
surgical ICU patients and has excellent validity 
when compared to a visual analogue scale and 
other selected sedation scales[reference] . . . The 
CAM-ICU was chosen because of its practical use 
in the ICU wards, its acceptable psychometric 
properties, and based on the recommendation 
of national guidelines[reference] . . . The CAM-ICU 
diagnosis of delirium was validated against the 
DSM-III-R [Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of 
Mental Disorders, Third Edition—Revised] delirium 
criteria determined by a psychiatrist and found to 
have a sensitivity of 97% and a specificity of 92%.
[reference] The CAM-ICU has been developed, 
validated and applied into ICU settings and multiple 
investigators have used the same method to identify 
patients with delirium.[reference] 
Delirium severity : Since the CAM-ICU does not 
evaluate delirium severity, we selected the Delirium 
Rating Scale revised-1998 (DRS-R-98)[reference] . . . 
The DRS-R-98 was designed to evaluate the breadth 
of delirium symptoms for phenomenological studies 
in addition to measuring symptom severity with 
high sensitivity and specificity . . . The DRS-R-98 is a 
16-item clinician-rated scale with anchored items 
descriptions . . . The DRS-R-98 has excellent inter-rater 
reliability (intra-class correlation 0.97) and internal 
consistency (Cronbach ’ s alpha 0.94).[reference] 
 Secondary outcomes 
 The study will collect demographic and baseline 
functional information from the patient ’ s legally 
authorized representative and/or caregivers. 
Cognitive function status will be obtained by 
interviewing the patient ’ s legally authorized 
representative using the Informant Questionnaire on 
Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (IQCODE). IQCODE is 
a questionnaire that can be completed by a relative 
or other caregiver to determine whether that person 
has declined in cognitive functioning. The IQCODE 
lists 26 everyday situations . . . Each situation is 
rated by the informant for amount of change over the 
previous 10 years, using a Likert scale ranging from 
1-much improved to 5-much worse. The IQCODE has 
a sensitivity between 69% to 100% and specificity of 
80% to 96% for dementia.[reference] 
 Utilizing the electronic medical record system 
(RMRS), we will collect several data points of interest 
at baseline and throughout the study period . . 
. We have previously defined hospital-related 
consequences to include: the number of patients 
with documented falls, use of physical restraints 
. . . These will be assessed using the RMRS, direct 
daily observation, and retrospective review of the 
electronic medical record. This definition of delirium 
related hospital complications has been previously 
used and published.[reference]” 266
 “Training and certification plans 
 . . . Each center’s personnel will be trained centrally in 
the study requirements, standardized measurement 
of height, weight, and blood pressure, requirements 
for laboratory specimen collection including morning 
urine samples, counseling for adherence and the 
eliciting of information from study participants in a 
uniform reproducible manner. 
 . . . The data to be collected and the procedures to 
be conducted at each visit will be reviewed in detail. 
Each of the data collection forms and the nature of the 
required information will be discussed in detail on an 
item by item basis. Coordinators will learn how to code 
medications using the WHODrug software and how to 
code symptoms using the MedDRA software. Entering 
data forms, responding to data discrepancy queries and 
general information about obtaining research quality 
data will also be covered during the training session. 
 . . . 
 13.7. Quality Control of the Core Lab 
 Data from the Core Lab will be securely transmitted in 
batches and quality controlled in the same manner 
as Core Coordinating Center data; ie data will be 
entered and verified in the database on the Cleveland 
Clinic Foundation SUN with a subset later selected for 
additional quality control. Appropriate edit checks will 
be in place at the key entry (database) level. 
 The Core Lab is to have an internal quality control 
system established prior to analyzing any FSGS [focal 
segmental glomerulosclerosis] samples. This system 
will be outlined in the Manual of Operations for the 
Core Lab(s) which is prepared and submitted by the 
Core Lab to the DCC [data coordinating centre] prior to 
initiating of the study. 
 At a minimum this system must include: 
 1) The inclusion of at least two known quality control 
samples; the reported measurements of the quality 
control samples must fall within specified ranges in 
order to be certified as acceptable. 
 2) Calibration at FDA approved manufacturers’ 
recommended schedules. 
 13.8. Quality Control of the Biopsy Committee 
 The chair of the pathology committee will circulate to 
all of the study pathologists . . . samples [sic] biopsy 
specimens for evaluation after criteria to establish 
diagnosis of FSGS has been agreed. This internal 
review process will serve to ensure common criteria 
and assessment of biopsy specimens for confirmation 
of diagnosis of FSGS.” 267

RESEARCH METHODS AND REPORTING
 Explanation 
 Trial investigators must o# en seek a balance between achiev￾ing a su8 ciently long follow-up for clinically relevant out￾come measurement, 122
 
 288 and a su8 ciently short follow-up 
to decrease attrition and maximise completeness of data col￾lection. Non-retention refers to instances where participants 
are prematurely “o" -study” (ie, consent withdrawn or lost to 
follow-up) and thus outcome data cannot be obtained from 
them. The majority of trials will have some degree of non￾retention, and the number of these “o" -study” participants 
usually increases with the length of follow-up. 116
 
 It is desirable to plan ahead for how retention will be pro￾moted in order to prevent missing data and avoid the associ￾ated complexities in both the study analysis (Item 20c) and 
interpretation. Certain methods can improve participant reten￾tion, 67
 
 152
 
 289- 292 such as & nancial reimbursement; systematic 
methods and reminders for contacting patients, scheduling 
appointments, and monitoring retention; and limiting par￾ticipant burden related to follow-up visits and procedures 
(Item 13). A participant who withdraws consent for follow-up 
assessment of one outcome may be willing to continue with 
assessments for other outcomes, if given the option. 
 Non-retention should be distinguished from non-adher￾ence. 293 Non-adherence refers to deviation from intervention 
protocols (Item 11c) or from the follow-up schedule of assess￾ments (Item 13), but does not mean that the participant is 
“o" -study” and no longer in the trial. Because missing data 
can be a major threat to trial validity and statistical power, 
non-adherence should not be an automatic reason for ceas￾ing to collect data from the trial participant prior to study 
completion. In particular for randomised trials, it is widely 
recommended that all participants be included in an inten￾tion to treat analysis, regardless of adherence (Item 20c). 
statistical power, 272 while those with low validity will not 
accurately measure the intended outcome variable. One 
study found that only 35% (47/133) of randomised trials 
in acute stroke used a measure with established reliability 
or validity. 279 Modi& ed versions of validated measurement 
tools may no longer be considered validated, and use of 
unpublished measurement scales can introduce bias and 
in1 ate treatment e" ect sizes. 280
 
 Standard processes should be implemented by local 
study personnel to enhance data quality and reduce bias 
by detecting and reducing the amount of missing or incom￾plete data, inaccuracies, and excessive variability in meas￾urements. 281-285 Examples include standardised training 
and testing of outcome assessors to promote consistency; 
tests of the validity or reliability of study instruments; and 
duplicate data measurements. 
 A clear protocol description of the data collection proc￾ess—including the personnel, methods, instruments, and 
measures to promote data quality—can facilitate imple￾mentation and helps protocol reviewers to assess their 
appropriateness. Inclusion of data collection forms in the 
protocol (ie, as appendices) is highly recommended, as the 
way in which data are obtained can substantially a" ect the 
results. If not included in the protocol, then a reference 
to where the forms can be found should be provided. If 
performed, pilot testing and assessment of reliability and 
validity of the forms should also be described. 
 Data collection methods—retention

complete follow-up, including list of any outcome data to 
be collected for participants who discontinue or deviate 
from intervention protocols 
 “5.2.2 Retention 
 . . . As with recruitment, retention addresses all levels 
of participant. 
 At the parent and student level, study investigators 
and staff: 
• Provide written feedback to all parents of participating 
students about the results of the “health screenings” . . . 
• Maintain interest in the study through materials and 
mailings . . . 
• Send letters to parents and students prior to the final 
data collection, reminding them of the upcoming data 
collection and the incentives the students will receive. 
 At the school level, study investigators and staff: 
• Provide periodic communications via newsletters 
and presentations to inform the school officials/
staff, students, and parents about type 2 diabetes, 
the current status of the study, and plans for the next 
phase, as well as to acknowledge their support. 
• . . . 
• Become a presence in the intervention schools to 
monitor and maintain consistency in implementation, 
. . . be as flexible as possible with study schedule and 
proactive in resolving conflicts with schools. 
• Provide school administration and faculty with the 
schedule or grid showing how the intervention fits 
into the school calendar . . . 
• Solicit support from parents, school officials/staff, 
and teachers . . . 
• Provide periodic incentives for school staff and 
teachers. 
• Provide monetary incentives for the schools that 
increase with each year of the study [table 6]. . .” 286
 
 “5.4 Infant Evaluations in the Case of Treatment 
Discontinuation or Study Withdrawal 
 All randomized infants completing the 18-month 
evaluation schedule will have fulfilled the infant 
clinical and laboratory evaluation requirements for 
the study. . . 
 All randomized infants who are prematurely 
discontinued from study drug will be considered 
off study drug/on study and will follow the same 
schedule of events as those infants who continue 
study treatment except adherence assessment. All of 
these infants will be followed through 18 months as 
scheduled. 
 Randomized infants prematurely discontinued 
from the study before the 6-month evaluation will 
have the following clinical and laboratory evaluations 
performed, if possible: . . . 
• Roche Amplicor HIV-1 DNA PCR [polymerase chain 
reaction] and cell pellet storage 
• Plasma for storage (for NVP [nevirapine] resistance, 
HIV-1 RNA PCR and NVP concentration) 
 . . . 
 Randomized infants prematurely discontinued from 
the study at any time after the 6-month evaluation will 
have the following clinical and laboratory evaluations 
performed, if possible: 
 . . . 
 5.5 Participant Retention 
 Once an infant is enrolled or randomized, the study site 
will make every reasonable effort to follow the infant for 
the entire study period . . . It is projected that the rate of 
loss-to-follow-up on an annual basis will be at most 5% 
. . . Study site staff are responsible for developing and 
implementing local standard operating procedures to 
achieve this level of follow-up. 
 5.6 Participant Withdrawal 
 Participants may withdraw from the study for any 
reason at any time. The investigator also may withdraw 
participants from the study in order to protect their 
safety and/or if they are unwilling or unable to comply 
with required study procedures after consultation with 
the Protocol Chair, National Institutes of Health (NIH) 
Medical Officers, Statistical and Data Management 
Center (SDMC) Protocol Statistician, and Coordinating 
and Operations Center (CORE) Protocol Specialist. 
 Participants also may be withdrawn if the study 
sponsor or government or regulatory authorities 
terminate the study prior to its planned end date. 
 Note: Early discontinuation of study product for 
any reason is not a reason for withdrawal from the 
study.” 287

procedures can be found, if not in the protocol 
 Explanation 
 Careful planning of data management with appropriate 
personnel can help to prevent flaws that compromise 
data validity. The protocol should provide a full descrip￾tion of the data entry and coding processes, along with 
measures to promote their quality, or provide key elements 
and a reference to where full information can be found. 
These details are particularly important for the primary 
outcome data. The protocol should also document data 
security measures to prevent unauthorised access to or 
loss of participant data, as well as plans for data storage 
 Protocols should describe any retention strategies and 
de& ne which outcome data will be recorded from protocol 
non-adherers. 152 Protocols should also detail any plans to 
record the reasons for non-adherence (eg, discontinuation 
of intervention due to harms versus lack of e8 cacy) and non￾retention (ie, consent withdrawn; lost to follow-up), as this 
information can in1 uence the handling of missing data and

 “13.9.2. Data Forms and Data Entry 
 In the FSGS-CT [focal segmental glomerulosclerosis—
clinical trial], all data will be entered electronically. 
This may be done at a Core Coordinating Center or 
at the participating site where the data originated. 
Original study forms will be entered and kept on file 
at the participating site. A subset will be requested 
later for quality control; when a form is selected, 
the participating site staff will pull that form, copy it, 
and sent [sic] the copy to the DCC [data coordinating 
center] for re-entry. 
 . . . Participant files are to be stored in numerical 
order and stored in a secure and accessible place and 
manner. Participant files will be maintained in storage 
for a period of 3 years after completion of the study. 
 13.9.3. Data Transmission and Editing 
 The data entry screens will resemble the paper forms 
approved by the steering committee. Data integrity 
will be enforced through a variety of mechanisms. 
Referential data rules, valid values, range checks, and 
consistency checks against data already stored in the 
database (ie, longitudinal checks) will be supported. 
The option to chose [sic] a value from a list of valid 
codes and a description of what each code means will 
be available where applicable. Checks will be applied 
at the time of data entry into a specific field and/or 
before the data is written (committed) to the database. 
Modifications to data written to the database will be 
documented through either the data change system 
or an inquiry system. Data entered into the database 
will be retrievable for viewing through the data entry 
applications. The type of activity that an individual 
user may undertake is regulated by the privileges 
associated with his/her user identification code and 
password. 
 13.9.4. Data Discrepancy Inquiries and Reports to 
Core Coordinating Centers 
 Additional errors will be detected by programs designed 
to detect missing data or specific errors in the data. 
These errors will be summarized along with detailed 
descriptions for each specific problem in Data Query 
Reports, which will be sent to the Data Managers at the 
Core Coordinating Centers . . . 
 The Data Manager who receives the inquiry will 
respond by checking the original forms for inconsistency, 
checking other sources to determine the correction, 
modifying the original (paper) form entering a response 
to the query. Note that it will be necessary for Data 
Managers to respond to each inquiry received in order to 
obtain closure on the queried item. 
 The Core Coordinating Center and participating site 
personnel will be responsible for making appropriate 
corrections to the original paper forms whenever any 
data item is changed . . . Written documentation of 
changes will be available via electronic logs and audit 
trails. 
 . . . 
 Biopsy and biochemistry reports will be sent via e-mail 
when data are received from the Core Lab. 
 . . . 
 13.9.5. Security and Back-Up of Data 
 . . . All forms, diskettes and tapes related to study data 
will be kept in locked cabinets. Access to the study 
data will be restricted. In addition, Core Coordinating 
Centers will only have access to their own center’s data. 
A password system will be utilized to control access . . . 
These passwords will be changed on a regular basis. All 
reports prepared by the DCC will be prepared such that 
no individual subject can be identified. 
 A complete back up of the primary DCC database 
will be performed twice a month. These tapes will be 
stored off-site in a climate-controlled facility and will 
be retained indefinitely. Incremental data back-ups 
will be performed on a daily basis. These tapes will 
be retained for at least one week on-site. Back-ups of 
periodic data analysis files will also be kept. These tapes 
will be retained at the off-site location until the Study is 
completed and the database is on file with NIH [National 
Institutes of Health]. In addition to the system back￾ups, additional measures will be taken to back-up and 
export the database on a regular basis at the database 
management level. . . 
 13.9.6. Study status reports 
 The DCC will send weekly email reports with information 
on missing data, missing forms, and missing visits. 
Personnel at the Core Coordinating Center and the 
Participating Sites should review these reports for 
accuracy and report any discrepancies to the DCC. 
 . . . 
 13.9.8. Description of Hardware at DCC 
 A SUN Workstation environment is maintained in the 
department with a SUN SPARCstation 10 model 41 as 
the server . . . Primary access to the departments [sic] 
computing facilities will be through the Internet . . . For 
maximum programming efficiency, the Oracle database 
management system and the SAS and BMDP statistical 
analysis systems will be employed for this study. . . . 
 Oracle facilitates sophisticated integrity checks through 
a variety of mechanisms including stored procedures, 
stored triggers, and declarative database integrity—for 
between table verifications. Oracle allows data checks 
to be programmed once in the database rather than 
repeating the same checks among many applications 
. . . Security is enforced through passwords and may be 
assigned at different levels to groups and individuals.” 267

RESEARCH METHODS AND REPORTING
 Results for the primary outcome can be substantially 
a" ected by the choice of analysis methods. When investiga￾tors apply more than one analysis strategy for a speci& c pri￾mary outcome, there is potential for inappropriate selective 
reporting of the most interesting result. 6
 The protocol should 
prespecify the main (“primary”) analysis of the primary out￾come (Item 12), including the analysis methods to be used 
for statistical comparisons (Items 20a and 20b); precisely 
which trial participants will be included (Item 20c); and how 
missing data will be handled (Item 20c). Additionally, it is 
helpful to indicate the e" ect measure (eg, relative risk) and 
signi& cance level that will be used, as well as the intended 
use of con& dence intervals when presenting results. 
 The same considerations will o# en apply equally to pre￾speci& ed secondary and exploratory outcomes. In some 
instances, descriptive approaches to evaluating rare out￾comes such as adverse events—might be preferred over 
formal analysis given the lack of power. 300 Adequately 
powered analyses may require preplanned meta-analyses 
with results from other studies. 
 Most trials are a" ected to some extent by multiplicity 
issues. 301
 
 302 When multiple statistical comparisons are 
performed (eg, multiple study groups, outcomes, interim 
analyses), the risk of false positive (type 1) error is in1 ated 
and there is increased potential for selective reporting of 
favourable comparisons in the & nal trial report. For trials 
with more than two study groups, it is important to specify 
in the protocol which comparisons (of two or more study 
groups) will be performed and, if relevant, which will be 
the main comparison of interest. The same principle of 
specifying the main comparison also applies when there is 
more than one outcome, including when the same variable 
(including timeframe) during and a# er the trial. This infor￾mation facilitates an assessment of adherence to applica￾ble standards and regulations. 
 Di" erences in data entry methods can a" ect the trial in 
terms of data accuracy, 268 cost, and e8 ciency. 271 For exam￾ple, when compared with paper case report forms, elec￾tronic data capture can reduce the time required for data 
entry, query resolution, and database release by combining 
data entry with data collection (Item 18a). 271
 
 277 When data 
are collected on paper forms, data entry can be performed 
locally or at a central site. Local data entry can enable fast 
correction of missing or inaccurate data, while central data 
entry facilitates blinding (masking), standardisation, and 
training of a core group of data entry personnel. 
 Raw, non-numeric data are usually coded for ease of data 
storage, review, tabulation, and analysis. It is important 
to de& ne standard coding practices to reduce errors and 
observer variation. When data entry and coding are per￾formed by di" erent individuals, it is particularly impor￾tant that the personnel use unambiguous, standardised 
terminology and abbreviations to avoid misinterpretation. 
 As with data collection (Item 18a), standard processes are 
o# en implemented to improve the accuracy of data entry 
and coding. 281
 
 284 Common examples include double data 
entry 296 ; veri& cation that the data are in the proper format 
(eg, integer) or within an expected range of values; and 
independent source document veri& cation of a random 
subset of data to identify missing or apparently errone￾ous values. Though widely performed to detect data entry 
errors, the time and costs of independent double data entry 
from paper forms need to be weighed against the magni￾tude of reduction in error rates compared to single-data 
entry. 297-299
 
 Statistical methods 
 The planned methods of statistical analysis should be 
fully described in the protocol. If certain aspects of the 
analysis plan cannot be prespeci& ed (eg, the method of 
handling missing data is contingent on examining pat￾terns of “missingness” before study unblinding), then 
the planned approach to making the & nal methodological 
choices should be outlined. Some trials have a separate 
document—commonly called a statistical analysis plan 
(SAP)—that fully details the planned analyses. Any SAP 
should be described in the protocol, including its key ele￾ments and where it can be found. As with the protocol, the 
SAP should be dated, amendments noted and dated, and 
the SAP authors provided. 
 Statistical methods—outcomes 
 Item 20a: Statistical methods for analysing primary and 
secondary outcomes. Reference to where other details 
of the statistical analysis plan can be found, if not in the 
protocol 
 Explanation 
 The protocol should indicate explicitly each intended 
analysis comparing study groups. An unambiguous, com￾plete, and transparent description of statistical methods 
facilitates execution, replication, critical appraisal, and the 
ability to track any changes from the original pre-speci& ed 
methods. 
 Example 
 “The intervention arm (SMS [short message system (text 
message)]) will be compared against the control (SOC [standard 
of care]) for all primary analysis. We will use chi-squared test 
for binary outcomes, and T-test for continuous outcomes. 
For subgroup analyses, we will use regression methods with 
appropriate interaction terms (respective subgroup×treatment 
group). Multivariable analyses will be based on logistic regression 
. . . for binary outcomes and linear regression for continuous 
outcomes. We will examine the residual to assess model 
assumptions and goodness-of-fit. For timed endpoints such as 
mortality we will use the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis followed 
by multivariable Cox proportional hazards model for adjusting 
for baseline variables. We will calculate Relative Risk (RR) and RR 
Reductions (RRR) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals 
to compare dichotomous variables, and difference in means will 
be used for additional analysis of continuous variables. P-values 
will be reported to four decimal places with p-values less than 
0.001 reported as p < 0.001. Up-to-date versions of SAS (Cary, 
NC) and SPSS (Chicago, IL) will be used to conduct analyses. For 
all tests, we will use 2-sided p-values with alpha≤0.05 level of 
significance. We will use the Bonferroni method to appropriately 
adjust the overall level of significance for multiple primary 
outcomes, and secondary outcomes. 
 To assess the impact of potential clustering for patients cared 
by the same clinic, we will use generalized estimating equations 
[GEE] assuming an exchangeable correlation structure. Table [7] 
provides a summary of methods of analysis for each variable. 
Professional academic statisticians (LT, RN) blinded to study 
groups will conduct all analyses.” 47

RESEARCH METHODS AND REPORTING
 However, subgroup analyses are problematic if they are 
inappropriately conducted or selectively reported. Sub￾group analyses described in protocols or grant applications 
do not match those reported in subsequent publications 
for more than two thirds of randomised trials, suggesting 
that subgroup analyses are o# en selectively reported or not 
prespeci& ed. 6
 
 7
 
 305 Post hoc (data driven) analyses have a 
high risk of spurious & ndings and are discouraged. 306 Con￾ducting a large number of subgroup comparisons leads to 
issues of multiplicity, even when all of the comparisons 
have been pre-speci& ed. Furthermore, when subgroups 
are based on variables measured a# er randomisation, the 
analyses are particularly susceptible to bias. 307
 
Preplanned subgroup analyses should be clearly speci-
& ed in the protocol with respect to the precise baseline 
variables to be examined, the de& nition of the subgroup 
categories (including cut-o" boundaries for continuous or 
ordinal variables), the statistical method to be used, and 
the hypothesised direction of the subgroup e" ect based 
on plausibility. 308

is measured at several time points (Item 12). Any statistical 
approaches to account for multiple comparisons and time 
points should also be described. 
 Finally, di" erent trial designs dictate the most appropri￾ate analysis plan and any additional relevant information 
that should be included in the protocol. For example, clus￾ter, factorial, crossover, and within-person randomised tri￾als require speci& c statistical considerations, such as how 
clustering will be handled in a cluster randomised trial. 
 Statistical methods—additional analyses 
 Item 20b: Methods for any additional analyses (eg, 
subgroup and adjusted analyses) 
 Explanation 
 Subgroup analysis 
 Subgroup analyses explore whether estimated treatment 
e" ects vary signi& cantly between subcategories of trial par￾ticipants. As these data can help tailor healthcare decisions 
to individual patients, a modest number of prespeci& ed 
subgroup analyses can be sensible.

b) Adjusting for baseline covariates b) Multivariable regression
c) clustering among individuals within a clinic c) GEE
 IMPORTANT REMARKS: 
 • The GEE [generalised estimating equations] [reference] is a technique that allows to specify the correlation structure between patients within a hospital and this approach produces unbiased estimates under the 
assumption that missing observations will be missing at random. An amended approach of weighted GEE will be employed if missingness is found not to be at random [reference]. 
 • In all analyses results will be expressed as coefficient, standard errors, corresponding 95% and associated p-values. 
 • Goodness-of-fit will be assessed by examining the residuals for model assumptions and chi-squared test of goodness-of-fit. 
 • Bonferroni method will be used to adjust the overall level of significance for multiple secondary outcomes.

come data obtained from all participants are included in 
the data analysis, regardless of protocol adherence (Items 
11c and 18b). 249
 
 250 These two conditions (ie, all partici￾pants, as randomised) de& ne an “intention to treat” analy￾sis, which is widely recommended as the preferred analysis 
strategy. 17
 
 Some trialists use other types of data analyses (com￾monly labelled as “modi& ed intention to treat” or “per pro￾tocol”) that exclude data from certain participants—such 
as those who are found to be ineligible a# er randomisation 
or who deviate from the intervention or follow-up proto￾cols. This exclusion of data from protocol non-adherers 
can introduce bias, particularly if the frequency of and 
the reasons for non-adherence vary between the study 
groups. 314
 
 315 In some trials, the participants to be included 
in the analysis will vary by outcome—for example, analysis 
 Adjusted analysis 
 Some trials prespecify adjusted analyses to account for 
imbalances between study groups (eg, chance imbalance 
across study groups in small trials), improve power, or 
account for a known prognostic variable. Adjustment is 
o# en recommended for any variables used in the allocation 
process (eg, in strati& ed randomisation), on the principle 
that the analysis strategy should match the design. 310 Most 
trial protocols and publications do not adequately address 
issues of adjustment, particularly the description of vari￾ables. 6
 
 310
 
 It is important that trial investigators indicate in the pro￾tocol if there is an intention to perform or consider adjusted 
analyses, explicitly specifying any variables for adjustment 
and how continuous variables will be handled. When both 
unadjusted and adjusted analyses are intended, the main 
analysis should be identi& ed (Item 20a). It may not always 
be clear, in advance, which variables will be important for 
adjustment. In such situations, the objective criteria to be 
used to select variables should be prespeci& ed. As with 
subgroup analyses, adjustment variables based on post￾randomisation data rather than baseline data can intro￾duce bias. 311

 Statistical methods—analysis population and missing data 
 Item 20c: Definition of analysis population relating to 
protocol non-adherence (eg, as randomised analysis), 
and any statistical methods to handle missing data (eg, 
multiple imputation) 
 Explanation 
 In order to preserve the unique bene& t of randomisation as 
a mechanism to avoid selection bias, an “as randomised” 
analysis retains participants in the group to which they 
were originally allocated. To prevent attrition bias, out-
 Examples 
 “We plan to conduct two subgroup analyses, both with strong biological rationale and possible 
interaction effects. The first will compare hazard ratios of re-operation based upon the degree of 
soft tissue injury (Gustilo-Anderson Type I/II open fractures vs. Gustilo-Anderson Type IIIA/B open 
fractures). The second will compare hazard ratios of re-operation between fractures of the upper 
and lower extremity. We will test if the treatment effects differ with fracture types and extremities by 
putting their main effect and interaction terms in the Cox regression. For the comparison of pressure, 
we anticipate that the low/gravity flow will be more effective in the Type IIIA-B open fracture than in 
the Type I/II open fracture, and be more effective in the upper extremity than the lower extremity. For 
the comparison of solution, we anticipate that soap will do better in the Type IIIA-B open fracture than 
in the Type I/II open fracture, and better in the upper extremity than the lower extremity.” 303
 
 “A secondary analysis of the primary endpoint will adjust for those pre-randomization variables which 
might reasonably be expected to be predictive of favorable outcomes. Generalized linear models 
will be used to model the proportion of subjects with neurologically intact (MRS ≤ 3 [Modified Rankin 
Score]) survival to hospital discharge by ITD [impedance threshold device]/sham device group 
adjusted for site (dummy variables modeling the 11 ROC [Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium] 
sites), patient sex, patient age (continuous variable), witness status (dummy variables modeling the 
three categories of unwitnessed arrest, non-EMS [emergency medical services] witnessed arrest, and 
EMS witnessed arrest), location of arrest (public versus non-public), time or response (continuous 
variable modeling minutes between call to 911 and arrival of EMS providers on scene), presenting 
rhythm (dummy variables modeling asystole, PEA [pulseless electrical activity], VT/VF [ventricular 
tachycardia/fibrillation], or unknown), and treatment assignment in the Analyze Late vs. Analyze 
Early intervention. The test statistic used to assess any benefit of the ITD relative to the sham device 
will be computed as the generalized linear model regression coefficient divided by the estimated 
“robust” standard error based on the Huber- White sandwich estimator[reference] in order to account 
for within group variability which might depart from the classical assumptions. Statistical inference 
will be based on one-sided P values and 95% confidence intervals which adjust for the stopping rule 
used for the primary analysis.” 304
 
 Example 
 “Nevertheless, we propose to test non-inferiority using two 
analysis sets; the intention-to-treat set, considering all patients as 
randomized regardless of whether they received the randomized 
treatment, and the “per protocol” analysis set. Criteria for 
determining the “per protocol” group assignment would be 
established by the Steering Committee and approved by the 
PSMB [performance and safety monitoring board] before the trial 
begins. Given our expectation that very few patients will crossover 
or be lost to follow-up, these analyses should agree very closely. 
We propose declaring medical management non-inferior to 
interventional therapy, only if shown to be non-inferior using both 
the “intention to treat” and “per protocol” analysis sets. 
 . . . 
 10.4.7 Imputation Procedure for Missing Data 
 While the analysis of the primary endpoint (death or stroke) will 
be based on a log-rank test and, therefore, not affected by patient 
withdrawals (as they will be censored) provided that dropping 
out is unrelated to prognosis; other outcomes, such as the 
Rankin Score at five years post-randomization, could be missing 
for patients who withdraw from the trial. We will report reasons 
for withdrawal for each randomization group and compare 
the reasons qualitatively . . . The effect that any missing data 
might have on results will be assessed via sensitivity analysis of 
augmented data sets. Dropouts (essentially, participants who 
withdraw consent for continued follow-up) will be included in the 
analysis by modern imputation methods for missing data. 
 The main feature of the approach is the creation of a set of 
clinically reasonable imputations for the respective outcome for 
each dropout. This will be accomplished using a set of repeated 
imputations created by predictive models based on the majority 
of participants with complete data. The imputation models 
will reflect uncertainty in the modeling process and inherent 
variability in patient outcomes, as reflected in the complete data. 
 After the imputations are completed, all of the data (complete 
and imputed) will be combined and the analysis performed 
for each imputed-and-completed dataset. Rubin’s method 
of multiple (ie, repeated) imputation will be used to estimate 
treatment effect. We propose to use 15 datasets (an odd number 
to allow use of one of the datasets to represent the median 
analytic result). 
 These methods are preferable to simple mean imputation, or 
simple “best-worst” or “worst-worst” imputation, because the 
categorization of patients into clinically meaningful subgroups, 
and the imputation of their missing data by appropriately 
different models, accords well with best clinical judgment 
concerning the likely outcomes of the dropouts, and therefore 
will enhance the trial’s results.” 313

the accumulated data have su8 ciently disturbed the clini￾cal equipoise that justi& ed the initiation of the trial. Data 
monitoring can also inform aspects of trial conduct, such 
as recruitment, and identify the need to make adjustments. 
 The decision to have a data monitoring committee (DMC) 
will be in1 uenced by local standards. While certain trials 
warrant some form of data monitoring, many do not need 
a formal committee, 326 such as trials with a short duration 
or known minimal risks. A DMC was described in 65% 
(98/150) of cancer trial protocols with time-to-event out￾comes in Italy in 2000-5, 327 and in 17% (12/70) of pro￾tocols for Danish randomised trials approved in 1994-5. 6
About 40% of clinical trials registered on ClinicalTrials.gov 
from 2007-2010 reported having a DMC. 328 The protocol 
should either state that there will be a DMC and provide 
further details, as discussed below, or indicate that there 
will not be a DMC, preferably with reasons. 
 When formal data monitoring is performed, it is o# en 
done by a DMC consisting of members from a variety of dis￾ciplines. 254
 
 329 The primary role of a DMC is to periodically 
review the accumulating data and determine if a trial should 
be modi& ed or discontinued. The DMC does not usually have 
executive power; rather, it communicates the outcome of its 
deliberations to the trial steering committee or sponsor. 
 Independence, in particular from the sponsor and trial 
investigators, is a key characteristic of the DMC and can 
be broadly de& ned as the committee comprising members 
who are “completely uninvolved in the running of the trial 
and who cannot be unfairly in1 uenced (either directly 
of harms (adverse events) is sometimes restricted to par￾ticipants who received the intervention, so that absence 
or occurrence of harm is not attributed to a treatment that 
was never received. 
 Protocols should explicitly describe which participants 
will be included in the main analyses (eg, all randomised 
participants, regardless of protocol adherence) and de& ne 
the study group in which they will be analysed (eg, as ran￾domised). In one cohort of randomised trials approved in 
1994-5, this information was missing in half of the proto￾cols. 6
 The ambiguous use of labels such as “intention to 
treat” or “per protocol” should be avoided unless they are 
fully de& ned in the protocol. 6
 
 314 Most analyses labelled as 
“intention to treat” do not actually adhere to its de& nition 
because of missing data or exclusion of participants who 
do not meet certain post-randomisation criteria (eg, spe￾ci& c level of adherence to intervention). 6
 
 316 Other ambigu￾ous labels such as “modi& ed intention to treat” are also 
variably de& ned from one trial to another. 314
 
 In addition to de& ning the analysis population, it is nec￾essary to address the problem of missing data in the pro￾tocol. Most trials have some degree of missing data, 317
 
 318
which can introduce bias depending on the pattern of 
“missingness” (eg, not missing at random). Strategies to 
maximise follow-up and prevent missing data, as well as 
the recording of reasons for missing data, are thus impor￾tant to develop and document (Item 18b). 152
 
 The protocol should also state how missing data will be 
handled in the analysis and detail any planned methods to 
impute (estimate) missing outcome data, including which 
variables will be used in the imputation process (if applica￾ble). 152 Di" erent statistical approaches can lead to di" erent 
results and conclusions, 317
 
 319 but one study found that 
only 23% of trial protocols speci& ed the planned statistical 
methods to account for missing data. 6
 
 Imputation of missing data allows the analysis to con￾form to intention to treat analysis but requires strong 
assumptions that are untestable and may be hard to 
justify. 152
 
 318
 
 320
 
 321 Methods of multiple imputation are 
more complex but are widely preferred to single imputa￾tion methods (eg, last observation carried forward; base￾line observation carried forward), as the latter introduce 
greater bias and produce con& dence intervals that are too 
narrow. 152
 
 320- 322 Speci& c issues arise when outcome data 
are missing for crossover or cluster randomised trials. 323
Finally, sensitivity analyses are highly recommended to 
assess the robustness of trial results under di" erent meth￾ods of handling missing data. 152

 Explanation 
 For some trials, there are important reasons for periodic 
inspection of the accumulating outcome data by study group. 
In principle, a trial should be modi& ed or discontinued when 
 Example 
 “Appendix 3. Charter and responsibilities of the Data 
Monitoring Committee 
 A Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) has been established. The 
DMC is independent of the study organisers. During the period 
of recruitment to the study, interim analyses will be supplied, in 
strict confidence, to the DMC, together with any other analyses 
that the committee may request. This may include analyses of 
data from other comparable trials. In the light of these interim 
analyses, the DMC will advise the TSC [trial steering committee] 
if, in its view: 
 a) the active intervention has been proved, beyond reasonable 
doubt*, to be different from the control (standard management) 
for all or some types of participants, and 
 b) the evidence on the economic outcomes is sufficient 
to guide a decision from health care providers regarding 
recommendation of early lens extraction for PACG [primary angle 
closure glaucoma]. 
 The TSC can then decide whether or not to modify intake to 
the trial. Unless this happens, however, the TSC, PMG [project 
management group], clinical collaborators and study office staff 
(except those who supply the confidential analyses) will remain 
ignorant of the interim results. 
 The frequency of interim analyses will depend on the 
judgement of the Chair of the DMC, in consultation with the 
TSC. However, we anticipate that there might be three interim 
analyses and one final analysis. 
 The Chair is Mr D.G.-H. , with Dr D.C. , and Professor B.D. Terms 
of reference for the DMC are available on request from the EAGLE 
[Effectiveness in Angle Closure Glaucoma of Lens Extraction] 
study office. 
 *Appropriate criteria for proof beyond reasonable doubt cannot be specified 
precisely. A difference of at least three standard deviation [sic] in the interim 
analysis of a major endpoint may be needed to justify halting, or modifying, such a 
study prematurely.[reference]” 325

the risk of a false positive (type I) error, and various sta￾tistical strategies have been developed to compensate for 
this in1 ated risk. 254
 
 333- 335 Aside from informing stopping 
guidelines, prespeci& ed interim analyses can be used for 
other trial adaptations such as sample size re-estimation, 
alteration to the proportion of participants allocated to 
each study group, and changes to eligibility criteria. 111
 
 A complete description of any interim analysis plan, 
even if it is only to be performed at the request of an over￾sight body (eg, DMC), should be provided in the proto￾col—including the statistical methods, who will perform 
the analyses, and when they will be conducted (timing and 
indications). If applicable, details should also be provided 
about the decision criteria—statistical or other—that will be 
adopted to judge the interim results as part of a guideline 
for early stopping or other adaptations. Among 86 proto￾cols for randomised trials with a time-to-event cancer out￾come that proposed e8 cacy interim analyses, all stated the 
planned timing of the analyses, 91% speci& ed the overall 
reason to be used for stopping (eg, superiority, futility), and 
94% detailed the statistical approach. 327
 
 In addition, it is important to state who will see the out￾come data while the trial is ongoing, whether these indi￾viduals will remain blinded (masked) to study groups, and 
how the integrity of the trial implementation will be pro￾tected (eg, maintaining blinding) when any adaptations to 
the trial are made. A third of protocols for industry initiated 
randomised trials receiving Danish ethics approval in 1994-
95 stated that the sponsor had access to accumulating trial 
data, which can introduce potential bias due to competing 
interests. 10 Finally, the protocol should specify who has 
the ultimate authority to stop or modify the trial—eg, the 
principal investigator, trial steering committee, or sponsor. 
 Harms 
 Item 22: Plans for collecting, assessing, reporting, and 
managing solicited and spontaneously reported adverse 
events and other unintended effects of trial interventions 
or trial conduct 
 Explanation 
 Evaluation of harms has a key role in monitoring the condi￾tion of participants during a trial and in enabling appropri￾ate management of adverse events. Documentation of trial 
related adverse events also informs clinical practice and 
the conduct of ongoing and future studies. We use the term 
“harms” instead of “safety” to better re1 ect the negative 
e" ects of interventions. 300 An adverse event refers to an 
untoward occurrence during the trial, which may or may 
not be causally related to the intervention or other aspects 
of trial participation. 300
 
 336 This de& nition includes unfa￾vourable changes in symptoms, signs, laboratory values, 
or health conditions. In the context of clinical trials, it can 
be di8 cult to attribute causation for a given adverse event. 
An adverse e" ect is a type of adverse event that can be 
attributed to the intervention. 
 Harms can be speci& ed as primary or secondary outcomes 
(Item 12) or can be assessed as part of routine monitoring. 
To the extent possible, distinctions should be made between 
adverse events that are anticipated versus unanticipated, and 
solicited versus unsolicited, because expectation can in1 u￾ence the number and perceived severity of recorded events. 
or indirectly) by people, or institutions, involved in the 
trial.” 254 DMC members are usually required to declare any 
competing interests (Item 28). Among the 12 trial proto￾cols that described a DMC and were approved in Denmark 
in 1994-5, 6
 four explicitly stated that the DMC was inde￾pendent from the sponsor and investigators; three had 
non-independent DMCs; and independence was unclear 
for the remaining & ve protocols. 
 The protocol should name the chair and members of the 
DMC. If the members are not yet known, the protocol can 
indicate the intended size and characteristics of the mem￾bership until further details are available. The protocol 
should also indicate the DMC’s roles and responsibilities, 
planned method of functioning, and degree of independ￾ence from those conducting, sponsoring, or funding the 
trial. 254
 
 330
 
 331 A charter is recommended for detailing this 
information 331 ; if this charter is not appended to the proto￾col, the protocol should indicate whether a charter exists 
or will be developed, and if so, where it can be accessed. 
 Data monitoring—interim analysis 
 Item 21b: Description of any interim analyses and 
stopping guidelines, including who will have access 
to these interim results and make the final decision to 
terminate the trial 
 Explanation 
 Interim analyses can be conducted as part of an adaptive 
trial design to formally monitor the accumulating data in 
clinical trials. They are generally performed in trials that 
have a DMC, longer duration of recruitment, and poten￾tially serious outcomes. Interim analyses were described in 
71% (106/150) of cancer trial protocols with time-to-event 
outcomes in Italy in 2000-5, 327 and in 19% (13/70) of pro￾tocols for Danish randomised trials approved in 1994-5. 6
The results of these analyses, along with non-statistical cri￾teria, can be part of a stopping guideline that helps inform 
whether the trial should be continued, modi& ed, or halted 
earlier than intended for bene& t, harm, or futility. Criteria 
for stopping for harm are o# en di" erent from those for ben￾e& t and might not employ a formal statistical criterion. 333
Stopping for futility occurs in instances where, if the study 
were to continue, it is unlikely that an important e" ect 
would be seen (ie, low chance of rejecting null hypoth￾esis). Multiple analyses of the accumulating data increase 
 Example 
 “Premature termination of the study 
 An interim-analysis is performed on the primary endpoint when 
50% of patients have been randomised and have completed 
the 6 months follow-up. The interim-analysis is performed by an 
independent statistician, blinded for the treatment allocation. The 
statistician will report to the independent DSMC [data and safety 
monitoring committee]. The DSMC will have unblinded access 
to all data and will discuss the results of the interim-analysis 
with the steering committee in a joint meeting. The steering 
committee decides on the continuation of the trial and will report 
to the central ethics committee. The Peto approach is used: the 
trial will be ended using symmetric stopping boundaries at P < 
0.001 [reference]. The trial will not be stopped in case of futility, 
unless the DSMC during the course of safety monitoring advices 
[sic] otherwise. In this case DSMC will discuss potential stopping 
for futility with the trial steering committee.” 332

day-to-day measures to promote data quality (Items 18a 
and 19). Auditing is intended to preserve the integrity 
of the trial by independently verifying a variety of proc￾esses and prompting corrective action if necessary. The 
processes reviewed can relate to participant enrolment, 
consent, eligibility, and allocation to study groups; 
adherence to trial interventions and policies to protect 
For example, providing statements in the informed consent 
process about the possibility of a particular adverse e" ect or 
using structured, as opposed to open ended, questionnaires 
for data collection, can increase the reporting of speci& c 
events (“priming”). 269
 
 337- 339 The timeframe for recording 
adverse events can also a" ect the type of data obtained. 340
 
 341
 The protocol should describe the procedures for and 
frequency of harms data collection, the overall surveil￾lance timeframe, any instruments to be used, and their 
validity and reliability, if known. Substantial discrepan￾cies have been observed between protocol speci& ed plans 
for adverse event collection and reporting, and what is 
described in & nal publications. 5
 Although trials are o# en 
not powered to detect important di" erences in rates of 
uncommon adverse events, it is also important to describe 
plans for data analysis, including formal hypothesis testing 
or descriptive statistics. 300
 
 342
 
 Finally, the protocol should address the reporting of 
harms to relevant groups (eg, sponsor, research ethics com￾mittee/institutional review board, data monitoring com￾mittee, regulatory agency), which is an important process 
that is subject to local regulation. 343 Key considerations 
include the severity of the adverse event, determination 
of potential causality, and whether it represents an unex￾pected or anticipated event. For multicentre studies, proce￾dures and timing should be outlined for central collection, 
evaluation, and reporting of pooled harms data. 
 Auditing 
 Item 23: Frequency and procedures for auditing 
trial conduct, if any, and whether the process will be 
independent from investigators and the sponsor 
 Explanation 
 Auditing involves periodic independent review of core 
trial processes and documents. It is distinct from routine 
 Example 
 “ Secondary outcomes 
 . . . In our study an adverse event will be defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject 
without regard to the possibility of a causal relationship. Adverse events will be collected after the 
subject has provided consent and enrolled in the study. If a subject experiences an adverse event 
after the informed consent document is signed (entry) but the subject has not started to receive study 
intervention, the event will be reported as not related to study drug. All adverse events occurring 
after entry into the study and until hospital discharge will be recorded. An adverse event that meets 
the criteria for a serious adverse event (SAE) between study enrollment and hospital discharge will 
be reported to the local IRB [institutional review board] as an SAE. If haloperidol is discontinued as 
a result of an adverse event, study personnel will document the circumstances and data leading 
to discontinuation of treatment. A serious adverse event for this study is any untoward medical 
occurrence that is believed by the investigators to be causally related to study-drug and results in any 
of the following: Life-threatening condition (that is, immediate risk of death); severe or permanent 
disability, prolonged hospitalization, or a significant hazard as determined by the data safety 
monitoring board. Serious adverse events occurring after a subject is discontinued from the study will 
NOT be reported unless the investigators feels that the event may have been caused by the study drug 
or a protocol procedure. Investigators will determine relatedness of an event to study drug based on 
a temporal relationship to the study drug, as well as whether the event is unexpected or unexplained 
given the subject’s clinical course, previous medical conditions, and concomitant medications. 
 . . . The study will monitor for the following movement-related adverse effects daily through patient 
examination and chart review: dystonia, akathisia, pseudoparkinsonism, akinesia, and neuroleptic 
malignant syndrome. Study personnel will use the Simpson-Angus [reference] and Barnes Akathisia 
[reference] scales to monitor movement-related effects. 
 . . . 
 For secondary outcomes, binary measures, eg mortality and complications, logistic regression will be 
used to test the intervention effect, controlling for covariates when appropriate . . .” 266
 
 Example 
 “11.4 Data Monitoring and Quality Assurance 
 Through the combination of our web-based, instantaneous 
electronic validation, the DCC’s [data coordinating centre] daily 
visual cross-validation of the data for complex errors, and regular 
on-site monitoring, the quality and completeness of the data will 
be reflective of the state of the art in clinical trials. 
 Both the European and US DCCs will conduct monitoring of 
source documents via fax at all enrolling ARUBA [A Randomised 
trial of Unruptured Brain Arteriovenous malformations] sites and 
will conduct at least one on-site monitoring visit per year over the 
course of the study at 100% of clinical sites (with repeat visits to 
sites where performance is a concern). Monitoring of European 
study sites will be assured by the European Coordinating Center 
(Paris). The primary objectives of the DCC during the on-site visits 
are to educate, support and solve problems. The monitors will 
discuss the protocol in detail and identify and clarify any areas 
of weakness. At the start of the trial, the monitors will conduct a 
tutorial on the web-based data entry system. The coordinators 
will practice entering data so that the monitors can confirm 
that the coordinators are proficient in all aspects of data entry, 
query response, and communication with the DCC. They will 
audit the overall quality and completeness of the data, examine 
source documents, interview investigators and coordinators, 
and confirm that the clinical center has complied with the 
requirements of the protocol. The monitors will verify that all 
adverse events were documented in the correct format, and are 
consistent with protocol definition. 
 The monitors will review the source documents as needed, to 
determine whether the data reported in the Web-based system 
are complete and accurate. Source documents are defined as 
medical charts, associated reports and records including initial 
hospital admission report . . . 
 The monitors will confirm that the regulatory binder is complete 
and that all associated documents are up to date. The regulatory 
binder should include the protocol and informed consent (all 
revisions), IRB [institutional review board] approvals for all of 
the above documents, IRB correspondence, case report forms, 
investigator’s agreements . . . 
 Scheduling monitoring visits will be a function of patient 
enrollment, site status and other commitments. The DCC will 
notify the site in writing at least three weeks prior to a scheduled 
visit. The investigators must be available to meet with the 
monitors. Although notification of the visits will include the list of 
patients scheduled to be reviewed, the monitors reserve the right 
to review additional ARUBA patients. 
 If a problem is identified during the visit (ie, poor 
communication with the DCC, inadequate or insufficient staff to 
conduct the study, missing study documents) the monitor will 
assist the site in resolving the issues. Some issues may require 
input from the Operations Committee, Steering Committee or one 
of the principal investigators. 
 The focus of the visit/electronic monitoring will be on source 
document review and confirmation of adverse events. The 
monitor will verify the following variables for all patients: initials, 
date of birth, sex, signed informed consent, eligibility criteria, 
date of randomization, treatment assignment, adverse events, 
and endpoints . . .” 313

 Protocol amendments 
 Item 25: Plans for communicating important 
protocol modifications (eg, changes to eligibility 
criteria, outcomes, analyses) to relevant parties (eg, 
investigators, REC/IRBs, trial participants, trial registries, 
journals, regulators) 
 Explanation 
 A# er initial ethics approval, about half of trials have sub￾sequent protocol amendments submitted to the REC/
IRB. 125
 
 346
 
 347 While some amendments may be unavoid￾able, a study of pharmaceutical industry trials found that 
according to the sponsors, a third of amendments could 
have been prevented with greater attention to key issues 
during protocol development. 346 Substantive amendments 
can generate challenges to data analysis and interpreta￾tion if they occur part way through the trial (eg, changes in 
eligibility criteria), 348 and can introduce bias if the changes 
are made based on the trial data. 173-176 The implementation 
and communication of amendments are also burdensome 
and potentially costly. 346
 
 Numerous studies have revealed substantive changes 
between prespeci& ed methods (eg, as stated in approved 
protocols, registries, or regulatory agency submissions) 
and those described in trial publications, including 
changes to primary outcomes, 12
 
 172- 176 sample size calcu￾lations, 6
 eligibility criteria, 125
 
 133
 
 134 as well as methods 
of allocation concealment, 2
 blinding, 3
 and statistical 
analysis. 6-8
 
 174 These substantive modi& cations are rarely 
acknowledged in the & nal trial reports, providing an inac￾curate impression of trial integrity. 
 It is important that substantive protocol amendments be 
reviewed by an independent party, such as the REC/IRB, 
and transparently described in trial reports. The notion 
of “substantive” is variably de& ned by authorities, but in 
general refers to a protocol amendment that can a" ect the 
safety of trial participants or the scienti& c validity, scope, 
or ethical rigour of the trial. 349
 
 350 To re1 ect the degree of 
oversight for the trial and adherence to applicable regu￾lation, the protocol should describe the process for mak￾ing amendments, including who will be responsible for 
the decision to amend the protocol and how substantive 
changes will be communicated to relevant stakeholders 
(eg, REC/IRBs, trial registries, regulatory agencies). Version 
participants, including reporting of harms (Item 22); 
and completeness, accuracy, and timeliness of data col￾lection. In addition, an audit can verify adherence to 
applicable policies such as the International Conference 
on Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice and regulatory 
agency guidelines. 160
 In multicentre trials, auditing is usually considered both 
overall and for each recruiting centre. Audits can be done 
by exploring the trial dataset or performing site visits. 
Audits might be initially conducted across all sites, and 
subsequently conducted using a risk based approach that 
focuses, for example, on sites that have the highest enrol￾ment rates, large numbers of withdrawals, or atypical (low 
or high) numbers of reported adverse events. 
 If auditing is planned, the procedures and anticipated 
frequency should be outlined in the protocol, including 
a description of the personnel involved and their degree 
of independence from the trial investigators and sponsor. 
If procedures are further detailed elsewhere (eg, audit 
manual), then the protocol should reference where the 
full details can be obtained. 
 Section 4: Ethics and dissemination 
 Research ethics approval 
 Item 24: Plans for seeking research ethics committee/
institutional review board (REC/IRB) approval 
 Explanation 
 A universal requirement for the ethical conduct of clinical 
research is the review and approval of the research proto￾col by quali& ed individuals who are not associated with 
the research team and have no disqualifying competing 
interests as reviewers. 1
 The review is typically conducted 
by a formal REC/IRB in accordance with jurisdictional 
policy. Despite the importance of ethics review, approval 
by a REC/IRB is not always obtained. Among 767 trials 
published in leading general medical journals from 1993-
95, 37 authors (5%) disclosed that such approval had not 
been sought for their trials. 344 The protocol should docu￾ment where approval has been obtained, or outline plans 
to seek such approval. 
 Example 
 “This protocol and the template informed consent forms 
contained in Appendix II will be reviewed and approved by 
the sponsor and the applicable IRBs/ECs [institutional review 
boards/ethical committees] with respect to scientific content 
and compliance with applicable research and human subjects 
regulations. . . . 
 The protocol, site-specific informed consent forms (local 
language and English versions), participant education and 
recruitment materials, and other requested documents—and 
any subsequent modifications — also will be reviewed and 
approved by the ethical review bodies. . . 
 Subsequent to initial review and approval, the responsible 
local Institutional Review Boards/Ethical Committees (IRBs/
ECs) will review the protocol at least annually. The Investigator 
will make safety and progress reports to the IRBs/ECs at least 
annually and within three months of study termination or 
completion at his/her site. These reports will include the total 
number of participants enrolled . . . and summaries of each 
DSMB [data safety and monitoring board] review of safety and/
or efficacy.” 287
 Example 
 “13.10 Modification of the Protocol 
 Any modifications to the protocol which may impact on the 
conduct of the study, potential benefit of the patient or may 
affect patient safety, including changes of study objectives, study 
design, patient population, sample sizes, study procedures, 
or significant administrative aspects will require a formal 
amendment to the protocol. Such amendment will be agreed 
upon by BCIRG [Breast Cancer International Research Group] and 
Aventis, and approved by the Ethics Committee/IRB [institutional 
review board] prior to implementation and notified to the health 
authorities in accordance with local regulations. 
 Administrative changes of the protocol are minor corrections 
and/or clarifications that have no effect on the way the study is 
to be conducted. These administrative changes will be agreed 
upon by BCIRG and Aventis, and will be documented in a 
memorandum. The Ethics Committee/IRB may be notified of 
administrative changes at the discretion of BCIRG.” 345

will be secured should they regain decisional capacity. For 
certain trials, such as cluster randomised trials, it may not 
be possible to acquire individual informed consent from 
participants before randomisation, and the consent proc￾ess may be modi& ed or waived. An explanation should be 
provided in the protocol in these instances. 357
 
 Consent or assent—ancillary studies 
 Item 26b: Additional consent provisions for collection 
and use of participant data and biological specimens in 
ancillary studies, if applicable 
 Explanation 
 Ancillary studies involve the collection or derivation of 
data for purposes that are separate from the main trial. 
The acquisition and storage of data and biological speci￾mens for ancillary studies is increasingly common in 
the context of clinical trials (Item 33). Specimens may 
be used for a speci& ed subset of studies or for submis￾sion to biorepositories for future speci& ed or unspeci& ed 
research. 
 Ancillary studies have additional processes and con￾siderations relating to consent, which should be detailed 
in the protocol. Guidance for the creation of a simpli& ed 
informed consent document for biobanking is available. 358
Participants can be given several options to consider with 
respect to their participation in ancillary research: con￾sent for the use of their data and specimens in speci& ed 
protocols; consent for use in future research unrelated to 
the clinical condition under study; consent for submis￾sion to an unrelated biorepository; and consent to be con￾tacted by trial investigators for further informational and 
consent-related purposes. This is commonly referred to as 
tiered consent. Participants should also be informed about 
whether their withdrawal from the ancillary research is 
possible (eg, the data and specimens are coded and iden￾ti& able); what withdrawal means in this context (eg, used 
specimens and data derived from them cannot be with￾drawn); and what information derived from the specimen 
related research will be provided to them, if any. 
control using protocol identi& ers and dates (Item 3), as well 
as a list of amendments, can help to track the history of 
amendments and identify the most recent protocol version. 
 Consent or assent 
 Item 26a: Who will obtain informed consent or assent 
from potential trial participants or authorised surrogates, 
and how (see Item 32) 
 Explanation 
 The notion of acquiring informed consent involves the 
presentation of comprehensible information about the 
research to potential participants, con& rmation that they 
understand the research, and assurance that their agree￾ment to participate is voluntary. The process typically 
involves discussion between the potential participant 
and an individual knowledgeable about the research; the 
presentation of written material (eg, information lea1 et 
or consent document); and the opportunity for potential 
participants to ask questions. Surveys of trial investigators 
reveal that appropriate informed consent is not always 
obtained. 344
 
 352
 
 The content, quantity, and mode of delivery of consent 
information can a" ect trial recruitment, participant com￾prehension, anxiety, retention rates, and recruitment cos
ts. 68
 
 114
 
 218
 
 292
 
 353- 355 We recommend that a model consent 
or assent form be provided as a protocol appendix (Item 
32). Assent represents a minor’s a8 rmative agreement to 
participate in the trial, which typically involves signing a 
document that provides age appropriate information about 
the study. 
 The protocol should include details of the consent proc￾ess as well as the status, experience, and training (if appli￾cable) of the research team members who will conduct it. 
In paediatric research, regulations may stipulate obtaining 
a8 rmative assent for participation from children above a 
certain age. 356 The protocol should then describe how perti￾nent information will be provided to potential participants 
and how their understanding and assent will be ascer￾tained. When potential participants lack decisional capac￾ity for reasons other than young age (eg, mental status), 
and proxy consent can be obtained from a legally-author￾ised representative, the protocol should describe who will 
determine an individual’s decisional capacity, whether a 
formal capacity instrument will be utilised, and how the 
individual’s informed agreement to continue participation 
 Example 
 “ . . . Trained Research Nurses will introduce the trial to patients 
who will be shown a video regarding the main aspects of the trial. 
Patients will also receive information sheets. Research Nurses will 
discuss the trial with patients in light of the information provided 
in the video and information sheets. Patients will then be able to 
have an informed discussion with the participating consultant. 
Research Nurses will obtain written consent from patients willing 
to participate in the trial. Information sheets and consent forms 
are provided for all parents involved in the trial however these 
have been amended accordingly in order to provide separate 
information sheets and consent form [sic] which are suitable for 
children and teenagers. All information sheets, consent forms 
and the video transcript have been translated into Bengali, 
Punjabi, Gujarati, and Urdu. There are also separate information 
sheets and consent forms for the cohort group.” 351
 
 Example 
 “6.4.1. Samples for Biorepositories 
 Additional biological samples will be obtained to be stored 
for use in future studies of the pathobiology of FSGS [focal 
segmental glomerulosclerosis]. A materials consent will be 
obtained to specifically address the collection of these . . . urine, 
serum and plasma specimens . . . 
 14.3.4. Instructions for Preparation of Requests for an 
Ancillary Study 
 . . . A signed consent must be obtained from every participant in 
the ancillary study, if the data collection/request is not covered in 
the original informed consent process for the main FSGS Clinical 
Trial. 
 . . . 
 A copy of the IRB [institutional review board] letter for the ancillary 
study should be sent to the DCC [data coordinating centre]. If a 
separate consent form is required for the ancillary study, a copy of 
the signed ancillary study consent form for each study participant 
must be included in the FSGS-CT [clinical trial] record. A data file 
tracking all signed ancillary consent forms must be maintained 
by the ancillary study and an electronic copy of that file must be 
delivered to the FSGS-CT DCC.” 267

RESEARCH METHODS AND REPORTING
 Explanation 
 Competing interests, or con1 icts of interest, exist when 
there is potential for divergence between an individual’s 
or institution’s private interests and their responsibilities 
to scienti& c and publishing activities. 360 More positive 
outcomes, larger treatment e" ect sizes, and more favour￾able interpretation of results have been found in clinical 
trials with pharmaceutical industry sponsorship (Item 
4) 27
 
 36- 38
 
 42 and investigators who have declared compet￾ing interests, 57
 
 60 compared to those without such interests. 
Although competing interests are most o# en associated 
with drug and device industries, they may exist with sup￾port from or a8 liation with government agencies, chari￾ties, not for pro& t organisations, and professional and civic 
organisations. 
 Competing interests do not in themselves imply wrong￾doing. Their disclosure and regular updating enables 
appropriate management plans to be developed and 
implemented, and facilitates transparent assessment of 
the potential for bias. 
 Many trials and non-industry sponsors have a con1 ict 
of interest policy for their investigators, and checklists are 
available to guide potential interests that should be dis￾closed and regularly updated by trial investigators. 361
 
 362
Types of & nancial ties include salary support or grants; 
ownership of stock or options; honorariums (eg, for advice, 
authorship, or public speaking); paid consultancy or serv￾ice on advisory boards and medical education companies; 
and receipt of patents or patents pending. Non-& nancial 
competing interests include academic commitments; per￾sonal or professional relationships; and political, religious, 
or other a8 liations with special interests or advocacy posi￾tions. 
 Access to data 
 Item 29: Statement of who will have access to the final 
trial dataset, and disclosure of contractual agreements 
that limit such access for investigators 
 Explanation 
 The validity of results from interventional trials can be 
veri& ed only by individuals who have full access to the 
complete & nal dataset. For some multicentre trials, only 
 Confidentiality 
 Item 27: How personal information about potential 
and enrolled participants will be collected, shared, and 
maintained in order to protect confidentiality before, 
during, and after the trial 
 Explanation 
 Personal information about participants is acquired during 
the process of trial recruitment, eligibility screening, and 
data collection. Much of this information consists of private 
details over which people customarily wish to maintain 
control, such as their health status, personal genotype, and 
social and family history. 
 The protocol should describe the means whereby per￾sonal information is collected, kept secure, and main￾tained. In general, this involves: 1) the creation of coded, 
depersonalised data where the participant’s identifying 
information is replaced by an unrelated sequence of char￾acters; 2) secure maintenance of the data and the linking 
code in separate locations using encrypted digital & les 
within password protected folders and storage media; and 
3) limiting access to the minimum number of individuals 
necessary for quality control, audit, and analysis. The 
protocol should also describe how the con& dentiality of 
data will be preserved when the data are transmitted to 
sponsors and coinvestigators (eg, virtual private network 
internet transmission). 
 Declaration of interests 
 Item 28: Financial and other competing interests for 
principal investigators for the overall trial and each study 
site 
 Example 
 “8.5 Confidentiality 
 All study-related information will be stored securely at the study 
site. All participant information will be stored in locked file 
cabinets in areas with limited access. All laboratory specimens, 
reports, data collection, process, and administrative forms will be 
identified by a coded ID [identification] number only to maintain 
participant confidentiality. All records that contain names or other 
personal identifiers, such as locator forms and informed consent 
forms, will be stored separately from study records identified by 
code number. All local databases will be secured with password￾protected access systems. Forms, lists, logbooks, appointment 
books, and any other listings that link participant ID numbers to 
other identifying information will be stored in a separate, locked 
file in an area with limited access. 
 All HIV test results will be kept strictly confidential, all 
counseling and blood draws will be conducted in private rooms, 
and study staff will be required to sign agreements to preserve 
the confidentiality of all participants. Study staff will never inform 
network members of the serostatus of other members of their 
group, but counselors will provide general messages about 
the prevalence of HIV in the study population in the interests of 
emphasizing harm reduction. 
 Participants’ study information will not be released outside 
of the study without the written permission of the participant, 
except as necessary for monitoring by NIAID [National Institute 
of Allergy and Infectious Diseases] and/or its contractors . . . 
representatives of the HPTN CORE [HIV Prevention Trials Network 
Coordinating and Operations Center] . . . and US or in-country

study participants to interventions identified as ben￾e& cial in the study or access to other appropriate care or 
bene& ts.” 1
 This principle is particularly applicable—and 
controversial—when research enabling the development 
and regulatory approval of interventions is performed in 
countries where subsequent access to the interventions is 
limited by cost or lack of availability. 368
 
 The protocol should describe any plans to provide or pay 
for ancillary care during the trial and identify any interven￾tions, bene& ts, or other care that the sponsor will continue 
to provide to participants and host communities a# er the 
trial is completed. 369 Any plans to compensate participants 
for trial related harms should also be outlined.

communicate trial results to participants, healthcare 
professionals, the public, and other relevant groups (eg, 
via publication, reporting in results databases, or other

restrictions 
 Explanation 
 A fundamental ethical principle in clinical trials is that 
the potential risks incurred by study participants should 
be balanced by the bene& t of contributing to publicly 
available knowledge. 371 Unfortunately, about half of 
the steering group has access to the full trial dataset in 
order to ensure that the overall results are not disclosed 
by an individual study site prior to the main publication. 
Many of these trials will allow site investigators to access 
the full dataset if a formal request describing their plans is 
approved by the steering group. The World Medical Asso￾ciation supports the principle that trial investigators retain 
the right to access data. 363 However, among protocols of 
industry initiated randomised trials published in 2008-9 in 
the Lancet or approved in 2004 by a Danish ethics commit￾tee, 30-39% stated that the sponsor owned the data while 
0-3% stated that principal investigators had access to all 
trial data. 10
 
 364 Similar constraints were found in Danish 
trial protocols from 1994-5. 10
 
 The protocol should identify the individuals involved 
in the trial who will have access to the full dataset. Any 
restrictions in access for trial investigators should also be 
explicitly described. 
 Ancillary and post-trial care 
 Item 30: Provisions, if any, for ancillary and post-trial 
care, and for compensation to those who suffer harm from 
trial participation 
 Explanation 
 The provision of ancillary care refers to the provision of 
care beyond that immediately required for the proper and 
safe conduct of the trial, and the treatment of immediate 
adverse events related to trial procedures. It is generally 
agreed that trial sponsors and investigators should plan to 
provide care for participants’ healthcare needs that arise as 
a direct consequence of trial participation (eg, intervention 
related harms). It is also important to consider whether 
care should be provided for certain ancillary needs that 
may otherwise arise during trial participation. Provision 
of care for ancillary needs re1 ects the fact that participants 
implicitly, but unavoidably, entrust certain aspects of their 
health to the research team. The scope of entrustment 
will vary depending on the nature of the trial (eg, setting, 
health condition under study, investigations performed). 366
Additional factors that in1 uence the strength of the claim 
to ancillary care include participants’ vulnerabilities; 
uncompensated burdens and harms; the intensity and 
duration of the participant-researcher relationship; and 
the degree to which participants are uniquely dependent 
on the research team for health care. 367
 
 The Declaration of Helsinki states that “the protocol 
should describe arrangements for post-study access by 
 Example 
 “12.10.1 Intra-Study Data Sharing 
 The Data Management Coordinating Center will oversee the 
intra-study data sharing process, with input from the Data 
Management Subcommittee. 
 All Principal Investigators (both US and host country) will be given 
access to the cleaned data sets. Project data sets will be housed 
on the Project Accept Web site and/or the file transfer protocol 
site created for the study, and all data sets will be password 
protected. Project Principal Investigators will have direct access 
to their own site’s data sets, and will have access to other sites 
data by request. To ensure confidentiality, data dispersed 
to project team members will be blinded of any identifying 
participant information.” 113
 
 Examples 
 “Patients that are enrolled into the study are covered by 
indemnity for negligent harm through the standard NHS 
[National Health Service] Indemnity arrangements. The 
University of Sheffield has insurance to cover for non-negligent 
harm associated with the protocol . . . This will include cover 
for additional health care, compensation or damages whether 
awarded voluntarily by the Sponsor, or by claims pursued through 
the courts. Incidences judged to arise from negligence (including 
those due to major protocol violations) will not be covered by 
study insurance policies. The liability of the manufacturer of 
IL1RA (Amgen Corporation) is strictly limited to those claims 
arising from faulty manufacturing of the commercial product and 
not to any aspects of the conduct of the study.” 145
 
 “13.6 Access to Effective Products 
 Should this study provide evidence of the effectiveness of TDF 
[tenofovir disoproxil fumarate], FTC [emtricitabine]/TDF and/or 
tenofovir 1% gel in preventing HIV infection, it will be critical to 
provide access to the effective product(s) to study participants, 
their communities, and the worldwide population at risk for 
HIV infection in a timely manner. In preparation for this study, 
discussions have begun with Gilead Sciences, Inc. and CONRAD 
[Contraceptive Research and Development Organization] to 
ensure such access. Considerations under discussion include 
licensing agreements and preferred pricing arrangements for the 
study communities and other resource-poor settings. 
 While this study is ongoing, the MTN [Microbicide Trials Network] 
will continue these discussions. In addition, discussions will 
be initiated with other public and private funding sources such 
as the WHO, UNAIDS, Gates Foundation, and appropriate site 
government agencies that may be able to purchase product 
supplies in bulk and offer them at low or no cost to the study 
communities and other resource-poor communities most in need 
of the product(s). Operations and marketing research also may 
be conducted to determine how best to package and distribute 
the products, and maximize their acceptability and use, in at-risk 
populations.” 365

RESEARCH METHODS AND REPORTING
 Furthermore, any conditions relating to the investiga￾tors’ right to publish or present trial results should be 
explicitly described. Publication restrictions have been 
imposed by various groups, including industry sponsors 
or the trial steering group (eg, to maintain the integrity 
of the overall dataset). 10
 
 380 These restrictions are some￾times not described in the protocol but rather in separate 
publication agreements. 10 However, as they can interfere 
with the ethical responsibility of investigators and spon￾sors to disseminate trial results in an unbiased and timely 
manner, 38
 
 381- 384 any restrictions should be disclosed in 
the protocol for review by REC/IRBs, funders, and other 
stakeholders. A review of industry initiated randomised 
trial protocols approved in Denmark in 1994-95 revealed 
that 91% had publication restrictions imposed by spon￾sors; similar constraints were noted for protocols approved 
in 2004. 10
 
 Dissemination policy—authorship 
 Item 31b: Authorship eligibility guidelines and any 
intended use of professional writers 
clinical trials remain unpublished. 80
 
 83 Trials with statisti￾cally non-signi& cant results or industry funding are more 
prone to non-publication, 36
 
 38
 
 80- 83 although government 
funded trials are also susceptible. 81 When published, 
trials with non-signi& cant results o# en have a longer 
delay to publication. 80
 
 83 Overall, the medical literature 
represents a biased subset of existing data, potentially 
leading to overestimation of bene& ts, underestimation 
of harms, and a detrimental impact on patient care and 
research. 80
 
 372- 377
 Although peer reviewers can be biased in favour of 
positive & ndings, 378 lack of publication appears to be 
primarily due to trial investigators or sponsors failing 
to submit negative or null results, rather than journals 
rejecting them. 80
 
 379 A plan to disseminate trial results 
to key stakeholders should be outlined in the protocol, 
including a process and timeframe for approving and 
submitting reports for dissemination (eg, via journal 
publication, trial registry, trial website), and an explicit 
statement that the results will be disseminated regardless 
of the magnitude or direction of e" ect. 
 Example 
 “XII. Publication Policy 
 The Publications subcommittee will review all publications following the guidelines given below and 
report its recommendations to the Steering Committee. 
 A. Data analysis and release of results 
 The scientific integrity of the project requires that the data from all BEST [Beta-Blocker Evaluation of 
Survival Trial] sites be analyzed study-wide and reported as such. Thus, an individual center is not 
expected to report the data collected from its center alone . . . all presentations and publications 
are expected to protect the integrity of the major objective(s) of the study; data that break the blind 
will not be presented prior to the release of mainline results. Recommendations as to the timing of 
presentation of such endpoint data and the meetings at which they might be presented will be given 
by the Steering Committee. 
 B. Review process 
 Each paper or abstract, as described below, must be submitted to the appropriate Subcommittee 
for review of its appropriateness and scientific merit prior to submission. The Subcommittee may 
recommend changes to the authors and will finally submit its recommendations to the Steering 
Committee for approval. 
 C. Primary outcome papers 
 The primary outcome papers of BEST are papers that present outcome data . . . The determination 
of whether or not a particular analysis represents a primary outcome will be made by the Steering 
Committee on the recommendation of the Publications Subcommittee . . . 
 D. Other study papers, abstracts and presentations 
 All studies other than those designated as “Primary Outcome” fall within this category . . . All papers 
and abstracts must be approved by the Publications Committee before they are submitted. 
 It is possible that in certain instances BEST may be asked to contribute papers to workshops, 
symposia, volumes, etc. The individuals to work on such requests should be appointed by the 
Executive Committee, but where time permits, a proposal will be circulated soliciting other 
participants as in the case of other study papers as described in the Application Review Process. 
 XIII. Close-out Procedures 
 BEST may terminate at the planned target of 1.5 years after the last participant has been 
randomized, or at an earlier or later date if the circumstances warrant . . . Regardless of the timing and 
circumstances of the end of the study, close-out will proceed in two stages: 
• Interim period for analysis and documentation of study results. 
• Debriefing of participants and dissemination of study results. 
 A. Interim 
 Every attempt will be made to reduce to an absolute minimum the interval between the completion of 
data collection and the release of the study results. We expect to take about 3 to 4 months to compile 
the final results paper for an appropriate journal. 
 B. Reporting of study results 
 The study results will be released to the participating physicians, referring physicians, patients and 
the general medical community.” 370
 
 Example 
 “17.4. Assignment of Writing Committees 
 Topics suggested for presentation or publication will be 
circulated to the PIs [principal investigators] of the CCCs [core 
coordinating centers], the DCC [data coordinating centre], Core 
Lab and the NIH [National Institutes of Health]. These groups 
are requested to suggest and justify names for authors to be 
reviewed by the PC [publications committee]. . . If a topic is 
suggested by a participant of the FSGS-CT [focal segmental 
glomerulosclerosis—clinical trial], the writing committee will 
be formed as just described except that the person making the 
suggestion may be considered as the lead author. The PI of an 
ancillary study should be considered for lead author of material 
derived from this study. Disputes regarding authorship will be 
settled by the Study Chair after consultation with the Chair of the 
PC . . . 
 17.5. Reports of the FSGS-CT: Classes of Reports 
 There are three classes of reports of the FSGS-CT: 
 A. Reports of the major outcomes of the Study. 
 B. Reports addressing in detail one aspect of the FSGS-CT, but in 
which the data are derived from the entire study. 
 C. Reports of data derived from a subset of centers by members 
of the FSGS-CT, (eg, sub-studies or ancillary studies), or reports 
of investigations initiated outside of the FSGS-CT, but using 
data or samples collected by the FSGS-CT. . . 
 17.6. Authorship Policy 
 The authors of FSGS publications will be listed as detailed below. 
 Type A publications: 
 abstracts: from the FSGS Clinical Trial Group x
 , presented by 
XXXX. 
 papers: from the FSGS Clinical Trial Group x
 , prepared by XXXX. 
x
 The FSGS participant box, detailed below, must be included 
in these papers. If a journal’s publication policy does not allow 
authorship by a group, the authors will be listed first as in Type B 
publications. 
 Type B publications:

 17.7. Authorship: Professional Participants Listing in the 
FSGS Participant Box 
 The FSGS participant box will list all professionals that have 
participated in the FSGS-CT for a minimum of one year.” 267

RESEARCH METHODS AND REPORTING
 Avenues for providing access to full protocols include 
journals, 407
 
 408 trial websites, and trial registries. 163 Several 
journals and funders support the sharing of participant 
level data, 405
 
 409- 411 while others routinely publish a state￾ment regarding sharing of protocols, statistical codes, and 
datasets for all of their published research articles. 412
 
 413
 
 The protocol should indicate whether the trial protocol, 
full study report, anonymised participant level dataset, 
and statistical code for generating the results will be made 
publicly available; and if so, describe the timeframe and 
any other conditions for access. 
 Section 5: Appendices 
 Informed consent materials 
 Item 32: Model consent form and other related 
documentation given to participants and authorised 
surrogates 
 Explanation 
 The Declaration of Helsinki states that each potential trial 
participant must normally, at a minimum, be adequately 
informed about the purpose of the trial; potential ben￾e& ts and risks; their right to refuse participation or to 
withdraw consent at any time; institutional a8 liation 
and potential competing interests of the researcher; and 
sources of trial funding. 1
 There are rare exceptions where 
deferred consent can be acceptable, such as trials involv￾ing unconscious patients in emergency situations. 
 Special attention is required to ensure that relevant 
information is provided and appropriate modes of deliv￾ery are used during the consent process (Item 26). 414 Con￾sent and participant information forms are o# en written 
at a much higher reading level than is acceptable for the 
general population. 415 Depending on the nature of the 
trial, several di" erent consent documents may be needed. 
For example, a paediatric trial may involve both parental 
permission and participant assent documents. For mul￾ticentre trials, a model or sample document is typically 
dra# ed for distribution to local investigators, who may 
then revise the document to comply with local require￾ments. 
 Biological specimens 
 Item 33: Plans for collection, laboratory evaluation, and 
storage of biological specimens for genetic or molecular 
analysis in the current trial and for future use in ancillary 
studies, if applicable 
 Explanation 
 Substantive contributions to the design, conduct, inter￾pretation, and reporting of a clinical trial are recognised 
through the granting of authorship on the & nal trial report. 
Authorship guidelines in the protocol are intended to help 
enhance transparency and avoid disputes or misunder￾standing a# er trial completion. These guidelines should 
de& ne criteria for individually named authors or group 
authorship. 385
 
 Individuals who ful& l authorship criteria should not 
remain hidden (ghost authorship) and should have & nal 
authority over manuscript content. 9
 
 386
 
 387 Similarly, 
those who do not ful& l such criteria should not be granted 
authorship (guest authorship). 386
 
 388 The International 
Committee of Medical Journal Editors has de& ned author￾ship criteria for manuscripts submitted for publication, 389
although these criteria have reportedly been open to 
abuse. 390 If some protocol authors are not named authors 
of subsequent publications, their role in protocol design 
should at least be acknowledged in the published report. 
Among 44 protocols of industry initiated trials, 75% had 
evidence of ghost authorship when compared with corre￾sponding journal publications. 9
 
 Professional medical writers are sometimes hired to 
improve clarity and structure in a trial report, and guide￾lines for ethical collaborative writing have been devel￾oped. 391
 
 392 Because the dra# ing of text can in1 uence how 
the study results and conclusions are portrayed, plans for 
the employment of writers and their funding source should 
be acknowledged in both protocols and trial reports. 
 Dissemination policy—reproducible research 
 Item 31c: Plans, if any, for granting public access to the 
full protocol, participant-level dataset, and statistical 
code 
 Explanation 
 Given the central role of protocols in enhancing transpar￾ency, reproducibility, and interpretation of trial results, 
there is a strong ethical and scienti& c imperative to ensure 
that full protocols are made publicly available. 24
 
 394
 
 395
High quality protocols contain relevant details on study 
design and conduct that are generally not available in jour￾nal publications or trial registries. 84
 
 396 It is also important 
to make available the full study report, such as the “clinical 
study report” submitted to regulatory agencies by industry 
sponsors. 377
 
 396- 400 This detailed report provides the most 
comprehensive description of trial methods (including the 
full protocol) and all published and unpublished analyses. 
In addition, there have increasingly been calls to improve 
the availability of participant-level datasets and statisti￾cal code a# er journal publication to enable veri& cation 
and replication of analyses, facilitate pooling with other 
studies, and accelerate research through open knowledge 
sharing. 372
 
 401- 406
 
 Example 
 “ Data sharing statement No later than 3 years after the 
collection of the 1-year postrandomisation interviews, we will 
deliver a completely deidentified data set to an appropriate data 
archive for sharing purposes.” 393

RESEARCH METHODS AND REPORTING
 Discussion 
 It is critical that every clinical trial has a complete and 
transparent protocol, which can then facilitate trial con￾duct and appraisal by communicating relevant infor￾mation to key stakeholders. In response to observed 
de& ciencies in protocol content, the SPIRIT Initiative has 
produced recommendations for minimum relevant proto￾col items to include in a protocol, published in the form 
of the SPIRIT 2013 Statement and this Explanation and 
Elaboration (E&E) paper. 14 The strengths that distinguish 
SPIRIT from other protocol guidance documents include 
its systematic and transparent development methods; 
participation of a wide range of key stakeholders; use of 
empirical evidence to support its recommendations; and 
availability of detailed guidance including model examples 
from protocols. 
 The overall aim of SPIRIT is to improve the completeness 
and transparency of trial protocols. The SPIRIT documents 
can serve as a practical resource for trial investigators and 
personnel to dra# and understand the key elements of a 
protocol. In doing so, our vision is that the SPIRIT 2013 
Statement and E&E paper will also facilitate and expedite 
the review of protocols by research ethics committees/
institutional review boards, scienti& c review groups, and 
funders—for example, by reducing the number of avoid￾able queries to trial investigators regarding missing or 
unclear protocol information during the review process. 
Furthermore, improved protocol content would help facili￾tate the critical appraisal of & nal trial reports and results. 
Finally, several SPIRIT items correspond to items on the 
CONSORT 2010 checklist (Consolidated Standards of 
Reporting Trials), 417 which should facilitate the transition 
from the protocol to the & nal study report. 
 The next steps for the SPIRIT Initiative include an imple￾mentation strategy to encourage uptake of the SPIRIT 2013 
Statement. The SPIRIT website ( www.spirit-statement.org ) 
will provide the latest resources and information on the ini￾tiative, including a list of supporters. We invite stakehold￾ers to assist in the evaluation of the SPIRIT Statement and 
E&E paper by using the documents and providing feedback 
to inform future revisions. Through widespread uptake and 
support, the potential to improve the completeness and 
quality of trial protocols, as well as the e8 ciency of their 
review, can be fully realised. 
 We thank Raymond Daniel for his help with reference management and 
Jessica Kitchen for her work with manuscript formatting and identi! cation 
of protocol examples. We also acknowledge GlaxoSmithKline for providing 
a sample of their trial protocols to serve as potential examples.

 Explanation 
 Biological specimens (eg, biopsy tissue; blood for DNA 
extraction) obtained during the conduct of clinical tri￾als can be stored in repositories—often designated as 
biobanks—for the current trial and future research. This 
process is usually governed by local regulation and has 
particular ethical considerations (Item 26b). 
 If the trial involves genetic or molecular analysis of 
biological specimens derived from humans, or if any 
specimens will be stored for future use (specified or 
unspeci& ed), the protocol should describe details about 
specimen collection, storage, and evaluation, including the 
location of repositories. In addition, the protocol should 
state whether collected samples and associated participant 
related data will be de-identi& ed or coded to protect partici￾pant con& dentiality. If a repository is overseen by a named 
research ethics committee/institutional review board, then 
this information should also be provided. 
 Example 
 “White Blood Cell and Plasma Collection Procedures 
 1.0 Objectives 
 1.1 To provide a resource for studies of early markers, etiology, and genetic risk factors for prostate 
cancer and other diseases. 
 2.0 Background 
 The Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) is a randomized double blind chemoprevention trial . . . 
 Initial blood collection was specifically for the analysis of PSA [prostate specific antigen] and storage 
of serum . . . an additional blood collection will be carried out using anticoagulant so that plasma and 
white blood cells can be isolated. Plasma will allow the analysis of additional biomarkers . . . This DNA 
will be used (among other possible uses) for studies to investigate polymorphisms in genes which 
may influence prostate cancer risk . . . 
 The PCPT WBC [white blood cell] sample will be available to PCPT investigators as well as outside 
researchers who have important, timely hypotheses to test. Because the sample bank is a limited 
resource, proposals to use it will be evaluated in terms of scientific relevance, significance, and 
validity as well as the potential impact of the proposed study. The amount and type of material 
needed will also be considered and the efficient use of material will be required. Strict confidentiality 
will be exercised and the information provided to investigators will not contain personal identifiers. 
 When specific uses of the WBC samples are approved, the SWOG-9217 protocol will be amended. 
 Participation in this research is not required for continued participation in the PCPT. 
 3.0 Methods 
 3.1 Because the original model consent form did not specifically address genetic studies, participants 
will be asked to sign an additional consent form to document their consent to the collection and 
submission of additional blood samples for storage and future testing (including genetic analysis). 
 3.2 Institutions will be asked to submit additional materials from participants who consent to the 
additional blood collection. The blood is to be collected, processed and shipped as described in the 
PCPT Study Manual. 
 3.3 NCI-Frederick Cancer Research Development Center (FCRDC) in Frederick, Maryland will serve as 
the processing, aliquotting and storage facility. 
 3.4 Upon arrival at FCRDC the blood will be pooled and centrifuged. Plasma will be separated into 5 
x 1.8 ml aliquots and frozen . . . 
 3.5 All samples will be logged in and aliquots will be bar coded with a unique storage ID. These data 
will be electronically transmitted to the Statistical Center for verification. 
 3.6 The scientists who will carry out analyses on these materials will not have access to personal 
identifiers and will not be able to link the results of these tests to personal identifier information. No 
individual results will be presented in publications or other reports. . . . 
 3.7 Participants will not be informed on an individual basis of any results from these studies . . . 
 4.0 Sample analysis 
 4.1 Investigators planning to submit NIH [National Institutes of Health] grant applications must obtain 
approval for their study and specimen access from the PCPT Serum and Tissue Utilization Committee 
before submission of a grant proposal. Potential investigators will be required to submit a brief 
abstract and 1-4 page outline . . . This proposal will be circulated for review to members of the PCPT 
Serum and Tissue Utilization Committee and two ad hoc members having relevant expertise . . . 
 4.2 It is anticipated that proposals will be reviewed once a year . . . Approval by this group as well as 
appropriate Institutional Review Board approval from the investigator’s institution will be required 
before release of samples.” 416
