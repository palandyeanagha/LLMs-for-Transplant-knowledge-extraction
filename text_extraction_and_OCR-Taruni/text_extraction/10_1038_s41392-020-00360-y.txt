Fulminant myocarditis (FM) is characterized by a rapid progressive decline in cardiac function and a high mortality rate. Since the
first report of FM patients in the 1980s, several clinical trials and research studies have been published increasing our knowledge
regarding FM. Currently, the diagnosis of FM depends on various techniques including electrocardiography, echocardiography,
endomyocardial biopsy, and cardiac magnetic resonance. The development of mechanical circulation support (MCS) devices and
progress in our understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying FM, treatment regimens have evolved from
simple symptomatic treatment to a life support-based comprehensive treatment approach. The core mechanism underlying the
development of FM is the occurrence of an inflammatory cytokine storm. This review provides a comprehensive account of the
current understanding of FM pathophysiology and knowledge regarding its etiology, pathophysiology, treatments, and outcomes.

INTRODUCTION
Fulminant myocarditis (FM) is an uncommon but severe cardiac
inflammatory disease that can be fatal.1,2 The progressive nature
of the disease is characterized by a severe and sudden onset,
which is marked by a rapid deterioration within 2 weeks that can
occur within 2 or 3 days.3 The rapid decline makes it difficult to
obtain a clear and early diagnosis, which often leads to
misdiagnose or delay in diagnosis prior to a patient’s death. Once
FM is suspected or diagnosed, use of modern life support devices
is highly recommended to prevent loss of life.4,5 Recent
improvements in FM treatments have resulted in decreased
mortality rates from over 50%6 to <5%7,8 in distinct clinical
centers, however, detailed knowledge of the pathogenesis
remains limited. The aim of this review is to present an integrated
account of the latest knowledge about FM, to improve disease
understanding and to provide advice to physicians regarding its
treatment and possible outcomes.
CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS AND EVALUATION OF FM
FM is a clinical diagnosis where prodromal symptoms, such as
fatigue, cough, dyspnea, and chest pain often show no
distinguishable difference from the common cold. An important
feature of FM is its rapid clinical progress, which can quickly lead
to hemodynamic dysfunction and circulation instability. This is
presented as a sharp drop of blood pressure that cannot be
maintained properly by vasoactive drugs and requires mechanical
circulation support (MCS) devices. It is common for multiple organ
failure to be observed in FM patients. As several reports about FM
indicate, deterioration and collapse of the circulatory system can
occur as rapidly as 2 days to 2 weeks from the onset of precursor
symptoms, highlighting the importance of early and differential
diagnosis of FM to ensure early treatment application.
When a suspected patient is admitted, routine tests including
physical examinations, blood chemistry, 12-lead electrocardiogram
(ECG), and emergency echocardiography should be conducted.4
Physical examinations may reveal signs of heart failure, including
decreased blood pressure, accelerated heartbeat, and markedly
decreased heart sounds, usually with gallop rhythm, with or without
tachypnea. Routine blood tests may reveal elevated neutrophils or
lymphocytes, indicating the presence of infection. Viral serological
assays should be considered but importantly negative results do not
necessarily rule out possible viral infection.9 ECG tracings demon￾strating arrhythmias or tachycardia with sinus rhythm can
demonstrate left bundle branch block (LBBB), reduced QRS wave
amplitude, ventricular premature beat, and ventricular tachycardia
suggestive of severe progression.10 Considering the results of
echocardiography can vary according to the state of the FM
patient’s heart function, repeated and close monitoring is
recommended. Markers of myocardium injury, such as cardiac
enzymes and troponin I or T, as well as NT-ProBNP provide insight
into damage and cardiac dysfunction but both acute coronary
disease and FM can have elevated biomarkers. As such, in order to
differentiate FM from acute coronary disease, emergency angio￾graphy should be considered.
When a patient presents symptoms of hemodynamic compro￾mise, it is very important to monitor the hemodynamic status with
an electric blood pressure recorder or in-vessel blood pressure
monitor and echocardiography. Compared to CMR, echocardiogra￾phy is an easier approach in common hospital settings limiting
operational complexity. In addition, the development of the global
longitudinal strain (GLS) techniques, allows better assessment of

heart function and provides an index for prognosis as observed in
immune checkpoint inhibitor-related myocarditis.11 It is worthy to
investigate the value of GLS in FM in the future, but it is not easy to
perform in the acute phase because of the critical conditions of
patients.
ETIOLOGY
While the exact etiology of FM remains largely unknown, our
current understanding indicates three main factors contribute to its
development. The first factor suggests an infection caused by
various pathogens, especially viruses,2,12 which manifest in clinical
features observed in FM. In fact, certain types of viral nucleic acids
can be detected directly in endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) samples
and serum by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or in situ
hybridization (ISH),9,13 such as parvovirus B19 (PVB19), coxsack￾ievirus B3 (CVB3), and cytomegalovirus (CMV).2 Although uncom￾mon, some viruses that usually infect non-cardiac organs, like
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV),14 can also induce FM.
Importantly, due to the limited sensitivity of detection assays, it is
possible to get false-negative results of a viral infection. A
multicenter study revealed that only 38% of myocarditis patients
can find viral genome in their EMB samples.15 PCR or PCR-based
detection techniques show the best performance, reaching
sensitivity levels in the range of 50–90%,9,13,16 and an ability to
detect multiple viruses in clinical samples.17 In contrast, serological
tests and ISH of EMB samples show poorer sensitivity.9 A study
reported a poor correlation between PCR and serological results,
with only 4% of serological evidence of viral infection being
determined by EMB.9 However, PCR-based detection techniques are
limited in scope to predicted or suspected viruses due to the need
for specific primers for amplification. Recent advances with next￾generation sequencing (NGS) has provided clinicians with an ability
to obtain unbiased results of possible pathogens of infectious
myocarditis.18,19 Interestingly, several uncommon viruses including
Epstein Barr virus (41%), human pegivirus (4%), human endogenous
retrovirus K (100%), and anellovirus (56%) were found indicating the
complexity of the viral constitution in FM. Apart from viruses,
bacteria including Chlamydia pneumoniae, Mycobacterium tubercu￾losis,
12 Neisseria meningitidis20 or protozoan such as Plasmodium
falciparum, Toxoplasma gondii12 or Giardia lamblia21 have all been
reported to trigger FM. Hence, special attention should be paid to
infected patients with rapid deterioration of cardiac function.
The second factor contributing to FM development is autoimmune
disease. The systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE),22 rheumatism,23
scleroderma24, and Sjogren’s syndrome25 have all been reported to
induce FM. By expressing PD-L1 on myocardium, the heart is
considered to be well-protected from cardiac-specific T cells, which
mostly recognize the α-myosin heavy chain peptide.26 However, a
disturbance of the balance of immune homeostasis by autoimmune
diseases may enable self-antigens to be exposed to the immune
system and mistakenly activate myocardium cytotoxic T cells. This
may partially explain the effects of glucocorticoids in treating
autoimmune disease-induced FM.27 Since the key pathological
process of autoimmune disease-induced FM is self-antigen such as
alpha or beta-MHC exposure to the immune system, it is convincing
that disturbances of the immune system caused by autoimmune
diseases lead to the formation of auto-cytotoxic immune cells, CD3+/
CD8+ T cell predominantly, as well as macrophages, targeting the
myocardium, eventually leading to FM.28
The third factor contributing to FM development is drug
toxicity. Many drugs, especially chemotherapy drugs and certain
natural derivatives,29 are toxic to cardiomyocytes,30,31 which is
exemplified by increased incidences in check-point inhibitor￾related FM.32 Although check-point inhibitors have brought
revolutionary advances to the treatment of late-stage malignant
cancers they induce the formation of auto-cytotoxic immune cells.
These cells subsequently attack the myocardium, resulting in the
accumulation of CD3+CD8+ T cells, macrophages, and neutrophils
in the heart.33,34 The prevalence rate of cardiac side effects of
checkpoint inhibitors is common, which can reach 25% or more.35
Although the prevalence rate of FM from checkpoint inhibitors is
<1% and is much lower than other targets, its fatality rate is as
high as 40~70%.35–37 Therefore, it is important to pay attention to
patients receiving chemotherapy who display cardiac function
deterioration, as this may be a sign of FM.
To date, there are three major classes of etiological factors in FM
known (Table 1). However, the exact mechanism(s) behind each
etiological factor remains largely unknown. Importantly, these
factors are not completely distinct but have overlapping signaling
pathways and cellular responses triggering their effects. It may be
hypothesized that the mechanisms underlying FM involve
common immune system pathways, for example, check-point
inhibitor-induced FM and hypersensitivity induced FM, are related
to auto-immune disruption and myocardium cytotoxicity T cell
activation.38,39
PATHOLOGICAL CLASSIFICATIONS OF FM
Although FM is thought to be a clinical diagnosis, it can also be
based on histopathological findings. The improvement in EMB
techniques has permitted clinicians the ability to make safe and
precise pathological diagnosis of FM.1 The pathological classifica￾tions of FM are still under the framework of the Dallas Criteria,

according to which FM is classified as lymphocyte myocarditis,
eosinophilic myocarditis and giant cell myocarditis (Fig. 1).
Although rare, cardiac sarcoidosis is a special pathological type
of FM, whose incidence is tightly related to genetic background.40
It is recommended to obtain a minimum of four or five samples
to limit sampling error41,42 when performing histopathological
examinations. Standard hematoxylin eosin (HE) staining can
directly reveal the pathological phenotype but immunohisto￾chemistry (IHC) can be applied for further identification.5 IHC
analysis will distinguish between morphological changes that are
due to the sampling process and the actual morphological shapes
of infiltrated immune cells.43 Moreover, IHC using cell type-specific
markers can make accurate classifications and help distinguish the
sub-types of infiltrated cells, such as the different T lymphocyte
subtypes (CD4+, CD8+), macrophage (CD68+), and B lymphocyte
(CD20+). Transmission electron microscope (TEM) can provide
myocardium ultrastructure information and possibly identify viral
particles,44 but technical limitations slow result acquisition and is
not used as a routine test.
The importance of the pathological classification of FM goes
beyond simply providing a pathological diagnosis. A pathological
classification will provide information about disease prognosis45 as
well about its etiology and treatment guidance. For example, data
demonstrating lymphocyte infiltration often implies infection,
usually by a virus.10 While evidence of eosinophil infiltration
indicates an allergy, a parasite infection46 or a drug reaction with
eosinophilia and systemic symptoms syndrome (DRESS syn￾drome).47 And the formation of giant cells is often related to
autoimmune disease or sarcoidosis.48,49 Both eosinophils and
massive lymphocytes can be observed in parasite-induced FM.50
Important information garnered from pathological assessments
can provide guidance toward therapeutic decisions. For example,
immediate immunosuppressive treatment with glucocorticoids
and subsequent tapering to low maintenance dose may be
initiated based on evidence of giant cell FM, cardiac sarcoidosis,
and eosinophil myocarditis resulting in better outcomes.51,52
However, the application of glucocorticoids in the treatment of
lymphocyte FM remains debatable, notably, disease caused by
viral infections. Evidence against the use of glucocorticoids in the
treatment of lymphocyte FM reflects concern the virus infection
may worsen and spread due to glucocorticoid-induced immuno￾suppression.5 While others have shown glucocorticoid use could
reduce virus titer by stimulating interferon secretion.8,53 Thus,
highlighting the importance in considering the complexity of FM
pathogenesis and its exact etiology as different clinical
approaches must be carefully determined based on a compre￾hensive analysis of clinical history, lab auxiliary test results and
EMB pathological diagnosis.
PATHOPHYSIOLOGICAL MECHANISMS UNDERLYING FM
The lack of comprehensive and systemic knowledge regarding the
pathophysiological mechanisms underlying FM has limited
therapeutic treatment regimens hindering effective interventions
at different disease stages. Although significant progress has been
made in our understanding persistent efforts are still required to
elucidate the complete pathophysiological mechanisms involved.
Cytokine storm in FM
While the complete etiology of FM remains unknown, a dysregu￾lated immune response has a critical role in the development of FM.
Adverse effects caused by infectious pathogens can overstimulate
the immune response contributing to the rapid disease progression.
Evidence from EMB samples demonstrate numerous infiltrating
immune cells in the necrotic myocardium.54 According to most
reports, the majority of infiltrated cells are T lymphocytes,
macrophages, and rarely B lymphocytes. Detection of CD3+CD4+
Treg lymphocytes or CD3+CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes55 is
commonly observed in EMB samples, which is consistent with the
IHC results obtained from FM patients at our center, demonstrating
massive lymphocyte infiltration (Fig. 1). Other immune cells
reported to infiltrate into myocardium obtained from FM patients
include Treg and Th17 cells.56,57 In addition, lymphocyte myocardi￾tis, eosinophilic myocarditis, and giant cell myocarditis are the result

of significant immune disturbances. Degranulated eosinophils can
be detected in the myocardium, suggesting key factors may be
secreted affecting the local immune response,27,50 however, the
exact components involved remain unknown. Phenotypic differ￾ences in human leukocyte antigen (HLA) are reported to produce
different immune responses triggered by the same stimulus, which
suggests genetic variants might be related to different sensitivities
to FM.40
In our center, we have analyzed the serum of 4 FM patients to
assess their cytokine profile. The data demonstrated marked
alterations in the cytokine profile and concentrations in FM
patients compared to healthy controls (Fig. 2). The majority of
cytokines were upregulated but several cytokines were down￾regulated. Secretion of dysregulated cytokines occurred from
numerous different immune cells (e.g., neutrophils, monocytes
and lymphocytes) indicating involvement and disturbance of the
whole immune system in the early phase of FM. In this context, we
refer to the term “cytokine storm” to describe the disturbed
immune homeostasis caused by FM. Importantly, these data
highlight the fact a cytokine storm has already started in most FM
patients at the time of admission due to a prolonged referral
process. This early response contributes to a quick deterioration
observed in a patient’s health immediately after admission.
Interestingly, our data from FM patients demonstrated specific
cytokines such as IL-1b, IL-4, IL-17B, IL-23, IL-10, IL-18, ST2, and
IFNγ are significantly upregulated but will subsequently decrease
to normal levels after proper treatments, which suggests they may
be potential biomarkers (unpublished data). Therefore, clinically,
investigations into the cytokine profile of FM patients can broaden
our knowledge about the underlying pathophysiological process
of FM and guide therapeutic decisions.58
Activation of cytokine ‘storm’ can be triggered by various
etiologies including pathogens such as viruses,59 bacteria,60
spirochete61, and fungi62 (Table 1), which can initiate effects
through receptors, like toll-like receptors (TLR). For example,
leakage of intracellular components from damaged cardiomyo￾cytes trigger an innate immune responses by activating TLR4.63
Once activated, downstream signaling cascades transfer informa￾tion about the extracellular pathogen into intracellular transcrip￾tion factors such as NF-κB64 and STAT365 to elicit a cellular
response. During the recent COVID-19 pandemic, several groups
have reported SARS-CoV-2 induced FM66 and a subsequent
cytokine storm.67 The upregulated cytokines activate receptor￾mediated signaling68 pathways that increase ERK69 and MAPK70
activity and key transcription factors like NF-κB and STAT3, which
result in further cytokine expression leading to a continual cycle of
cytokine production. The impact of cytokine overproduction has
direct effects on myocardium contraction and electrical transduc￾tion, which will be discussed below. Thus, the cytokine storm plays
a central role in the pathophysiology of FM (Fig. 3), detailed
reviews of the effect cytokines have on the heart can be found in
the subsequent discussion and elsewhere.65,71
Abnormal myocardial contraction
The primary function of the heart is to pump blood throughout
the body within the circulatory system. FM patients are
characterized by a compromised circulation, which usually results
in refractory cardiac shock requiring mechanical circulatory
support (MCS). Detection of myocardial contraction abnormalities
observed during the development of FM is routinely performed by
echocardiography (Fig. 4)
72 or cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR)
(Fig. 4).73 Hallmark injuries like massive ventricular wall hypokine￾sia and edema are believed to be induced by a cardiac
inflammatory response and global cytokine storm.
Cytokine storms disturb immune homeostasis and will directly
influence the myocardium. It was reported pro-inflammatory
cytokines, like IL-1 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), have a
negative ionotropic effect and directly decrease myocardial
contraction strength and velocity.74 These effects provide insight
into two common manifestations observed in FM. First, a rapid

reduction in cardiac pump function and cardiogenic shock,
represented by significant ventricular hypokinesia. And second,
deteriorated heart function, as determined by decreased ejection
fraction (EF%) or GLS. Depending upon the timing and therapeutic
approach, dysfunctional hearts can return to normal or just slightly
below the normal heart function range after appropriate
treatments.27,72,75 Since myocardial cells are terminally differen￾tiated and cannot be replaced once damaged, the normalization
of heart function is probably due to a contraction improvement of
each myocardial cell. Interestingly, a cytokine storm might cause
myocardial stunning and decreased cardiac function without
marked cell death, which could be reversed in a relatively short
time once the stressor is removed.75
Regular myocardium contraction is dependent upon mitochon￾drial function to produce energy. However, adverse consequences
of a severe cytokine storm produced during FM can directly inhibit
mitochondrial function76 and reshape the metabolic status of the
heart.77,78 An et al.79 used a LPS-stimulated ex vivo myocarditis
model to demonstrate the secretion of TNFα and phosphorylation
of NF-κB correlated with the depressed left ventricular contractile
ability and H2O2 production in cardiac mitochondria. Accumula￾tion of damaged or dysfunctional mitochondria will markedly
disrupt energy supply, increase ROS production and activate
innate immune responses, which ultimately lead to loss of
cardiomyocytes and decreased heart function.78,80
Pathogens can directly target the myocardium inducing
damage by releasing enzymes such as proteases or collagenases
that target sarcomeric proteins81 and the extracellular matrix
(ECM).82 Degradation of sarcomeric proteins like troponin and
dystrophin will directly damage the normal structure of the
sarcomere and fracture the myocardial filament. Breakdown of the
myofilament results in an inability to transduce the contraction
strength of the heart diminishing its ability to efficiently pump
enough blood into the circulation. While the degradation of
collagen fibers found in the ECM will stiffen the heart and reduce
its elasticity further worsening the ability to contract.83
At the cellular level, pathogens have been demonstrated to
activate different cell death pathways including apoptosis,84
necrosis, pyroptosis,85,86 and necroptosis87 resulting in decreased
viability. Whether a cause or effect, activation of different cell
death pathways are proposed to be involved in the pathogenesis
of FM, even myocardium necrosis has been observed in EMB
samples.88 Importantly, loss of terminally differentiated
cardiomyocytes will significantly reduce the heart’s contraction
ability. In addition, the increased cell death in the myocardium will
further trigger inflammatory responses and exposure of self￾antigens worsening the condition. This may subsequently lead to
auto-immune cardiomyopathy,89 which is recognized as a poor
prognosis factor in FM.90
Abnormality of the cardiac electrical transduction system and
arrhythmia
Maintaining coordination of electric transduction and synchroni￾city of the heart beat is of great importance for hemodynamic
stability. However, arrhythmias are very common in FM and
indicate a bad prognosis.91 Excitation-contraction coupling can
transform the electric signal to a physical contraction by
manipulating intercellular calcium signaling. Any disturbance in
this process may result in development of an arrhythmia.
Unfortunately, the cytokine storm in FM interferes with normal
calcium signaling. TNF-α and other pro-inflammatory cytokines can
activate calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase alpha
(CaMKα) and the following NF-κB pro-inflammation pathway.77,92
High concentrations of TNF-α decrease calcium transients and
attenuate cardiomyocyte contraction.93 IL-1 can activate ryanodine
receptor (RyR) and release calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum,
which causes intracellular calcium overload and deteriorates the
excitation-contraction coupling process.94 Together, these changes
will contribute to the development of arrhythmias.
Dysregulation of the calcium signaling pathways in cardiomyo￾cytes and the infiltration of immune cells, like lymphocytes, during
sarcoidosis is an important factor in the development of
arrhythmias. Evidence from endomyocardial electroanatomic
mapping studies indicate focal sites with massive lymphocyte
infiltration have lower potential. Hence, it may be easier for the
physician to obtain positive EMB samples under the guidance of
endomyocardial electroanatomic mapping.95 Although rare,
refractory arrhythmias are a characteristic of cardiac sarcoidosis,
which contributes to its poor prognosis.40 Sarcoidosis may be
complicated by cardiac fibrosis, which provides a structural basis
for reentry of the electrical signal.96 Another common feature of
FM is early repolarization (ERP), which may be a predictor of
ventricular tachyarrhythmias. However, a recent study showed ERP
was not associated with a worse prognosis and could not predict
the development of lethal ventricular tachyarrhythmias.97
Fig. 3 Illustration of signaling transduction in the development of a cytokine storm in FM and potential cardiac effects. Various etiologies
trigger inflammatory signaling that result in transcription and translation of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Secreted cytokines activate
numerous pathways via specific receptors leading to different cellular responses. Pathogens (e.g., viruses) can directly target cells resulting in
marked damage worsening the prognosis of FM patients

Indeed, it is important to precisely assess the electrical
properties of the myocardium, especially where and when
arrhythmia might occur. Arrhythmias are easy to detect with
continuous ECG monitoring were atrial fibrillation (AF), tachycar￾dia, and refractory ventricular fibrillation can be observed in FM.
Therapeutic treatment options are recommended to follow
current guidelines to treat arrhythmias. Implantation of temporary
pacemakers or cardiac defibrillator (ICD) have demonstrated
success and may be considered whenever necessary.98
Pathophysiological processes in the long-term prognosis of FM
Currently, there are contradictory reports regarding the long-term
prognosis of FM. It is commonly accepted the immune response
to pathogens and the related disturbance in immune homeostasis
has a marked impact on the long-term prognosis of FM. Although
FM patients may be discharged with normal or slightly
compromised heart function,72 disturbances of the immune
system, remnant inflammation and changes in autoimmune
tolerance influence prognosis and affect cardiac remodeling. We
have found at 1-year follow-ups of FM patients, over 20% develop
heart failure, arrhythmia or enlarged heart compared to ~10% of
acute myocarditis (Fig. 5). Evidence suggests cytokines released
from cytokine storms impact the cardiac remodeling process. For
example, transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β), is a pro-fibrotic
cytokine upregulated in the acute phase of FM, which will induce
exorbitant fibrosis. Fibrosis and scar tissue also provide a structural

basis for the occurrence of arrhythmia.96 A recent report described
a 28-year-old male who rapidly progressed into dilated cardio￾myopathy in 90 days after discharge from the hospital following
FM and required a subsequent heart transplant. The explanted
heart showed massive fibrosis.99 It is clear that the precise
mechanisms of the long-term pathophysiological changes in FM
remain unknown and, thus, need further investigation.
DIAGNOSIS AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS OF FM
The diagnosis of FM is largely based on the clinical symptoms
observed in patients rather than a pathological or pathophysio￾logical diagnosis.2 The following criteria should be met to
diagnose FM: (1) rapid onset of symptoms of severe heart failure
(quick deterioration of EF% or newly occurrence of transduction
block) within 2 weeks; (2) prodromal symptoms of upper
respiratory or gastrointestinal viral infections; (3) rapid develop￾ment of hemodynamic compromise requiring large doses of
inotropic drugs, like dopamine, dobutamine, and even MCS
devices; (4) CMR- or EMB-proven myocarditis (discussed below);
and, (5) exclusion of other cardiac diseases, especially acute
ischemia cardiomyopathy or coronary artery disease.1,4,45,100,101
Importantly, it is critical to differentiate between FM and acute
coronary artery disease as the treatment regimens are completely
different. Once a previous healthy individual or a non-cardiac
disease patient shows rapid heart failure, it is very important to
consider the possibility of FM.
EMB is considered the golden standard for diagnosis and helps
the pathological classification of FM. While not every patient
undergoes EMB, recent data indicate the rate of EMB use to
diagnose FM has increased.101 In Europe, about 20–50% of FM
patients undergo EMB,41 whereas a registry of FM patients in the
USA demonstrated an EMB rate of <5%.102 Although performing
EMB requires tertiary clinical centers with specialized equipment
and personnel limiting patient assessment, it is strongly
recommended to perform EMB as soon as possible. With the
application of modern molecular biological techniques, such as
RT-PCR, ISH or NGS,18 EMB samples can provide key information
about FM. The safety of EMB can be guaranteed by an
experienced operator and the incidence of adverse effects were
reported to be <2.5%.1,42 The majority of complications are not
lethal, including tricuspid regurgitation, transient right bundle
branch block, and transient arrhythmia. Life-threatening complica￾tions include ventricular perforation and related cardiac tampo￾nade.41 Another concern about EMB is that the inflammatory
infiltration of the heart may not be uniform, so EMB might give
false-negative results. It has been reported that by getting 4–5 or
even more EMB samples, the sampling error and false-negative
results could be reduced.
CMR is an alternative choice if EMB is not accessible or the
situation of the suspected FM patient is not stable. CMR can
provide physicians with data about both heart function and
cardiac morphology. The ability to clearly distinguish the
ventricular wall from the blood chamber can provide a better
resolution of morphology and precise evaluation of heart
function. With the application of different scanning sequences
with or without contrast enhancement, CMR is able to show
good tissue characterization and visualize pathological tissue
changes, including intracellular and interstitial edema, hyper￾emia, capillary leakage and even necrosis and subsequent tissue
fibrosis (Fig. 4).103 The most commonly used contrast enhance￾ment agents are gadolinium-derived. Early gadolinium enhance￾ment is a sign of hyperemia and capillary leak, while late
gadolinium enhancement (LGE) is a sign of necrosis and
fibrosis.73 When using CMR to diagnose myocarditis, Lake Louise
Criteria are the most widely accepted criteria to follow for the
final diagnosis.73 According to a recent study, the LGE pattern of
FM was significantly different from that of non-fulminant
myocarditis (NFM) (Fig. 4), which could help make a differential
diagnosis.104

Although CMR is capable of providing physicians with detailed
information about pathological morphological changes and heart
function, its most important shortcoming is the requirement of
special equipment and a time-consuming scanning process, which
limits its application in emergency and clinical centers that are not
capable of performing CMR because of emergency conditions of
patients and its requirement for heart rate control. In contrast,
emergency echocardiography is able to provide information
about heart function and cardiac contraction status (globally
hypokinesis) quickly and is suggested as a first-line assessment.
We have found in FM that strains among different layers of the
myocardium were diffusedly impaired,72 while NFM data mimic
AMI and display segmental impairment of myocardium strain.105
This feature of FM may also provide information to differentiate
FM from NFM.
Signs and symptoms like fever, palpitation, sore throat, syncope
and arrhythmia could be common but unspecific prodromal signs
of FM.106 Because of these unspecific prodromal manifestations of
FM, it is important to make a careful differential diagnosis in order
to avoid inappropriate treatments. Apart from acute myocardial
infarction, FM should also be differentially diagnosed from Tako￾Tsubo cardiomyopathy, pneumothorax and even acalculous
cholecystitis.107
TREATMENT REGIMEN OF FM
FM presents as a rapidly progressing severe condition where
patients respond poorly to conventional vasoactive drug
therapies as well to standard heart failure, refractory heart
failure, and cardiogenic shock treatments. However, improve￾ments in MCS devices has resulted in better therapeutic success
in treating FM patients from being <20% to 40–70%.6,108–110
Recently, FM patients in our center were successfully treated
with the “life support-based comprehensive treatment regi￾men”,
4 which significantly reduced FM mortality from ~50% to
<5% and shortened the hospitalization period to <2 weeks.
Similar beneficial effects have been demonstrated in other
centers in China8 using this therapeutic approach.
How did the treatment regimen evolve from being a simple
drug therapy to comprehensive treatment regimen? What are the
differences among these regimens? It there any possibility of
further improvement?
1980s–1990s: the age of drug therapy for FM
Due to limited circulation support and monitoring devices, FM was
very hard to distinguish from common myocarditis during this
period.111 The only remarkable symptoms were a quick deteriora￾tion of heart function and severe heart failure. Hence, it was very
reasonable to use standard heart failure therapy to treat FM owing
to limited interference strategies. Positive inotropic drugs or
vasoactive drugs were the first line of drugs administered to
enhance heart pump function and act against the decreased
blood pressure. However, high in-hospital mortality indeed
announces a failure in simple drug therapy.112
Results from pathological findings identified massive immune
cells, like lymphocytes, infiltrating myocardium, leading to the
utilization of immunosuppressive agents such as cyclosporine,
azathioprine and tacrolimus.113–115 Additional approaches
included administration of glucocorticoids and IVIG to suppress
the immune response.112 However, the effects of these
immunosuppressive agents remain debatable. For example,
results from ‘The Myocarditis Treatment Trial’ failed to support
immunosuppressive therapy as a routine treatment for myocar￾ditis and suggested long-term mortality of immunosuppressive
therapy was high.115 In this clinical trial, the mean change in
LVEF were not significantly different between the immunosup￾pressive group and control group (+0.10 vs. +0.07, p > 0.05), and
the mortality rates of the two group were also not significantly
different throughout the follow-up (65% of control group vs.
55% of the immunosuppressive group, p = 0.96). Numerous
limitations of the study included reliance on the ‘Dallas Criteria’
to distinguish biopsy samples with an EMB rate of only 10%, an
inadequate sampling amount, enrollment of patients with EF%
<45%, which indicated poor recovery from previous treatment,
and insufficient dosage of immunosuppressive agents.116 Taken
together, standard heart failure treatment aiming to improve
cardiac pump function or immunosuppressive treatment, target￾ing infiltrating immune cells, showed little effects in FM, which
set barriers for patients.
1990s–2010s: the age of MCS therapy in FM
The development of extracorporeal circulation devices to allow
the pump function of the heart to be temporarily replaced by a
mechanical device contributed to rapid advancements in cardiac
surgery. These new technologies led to further development of
different, compatible, and convenient MCS devices that could be
rapidly applied to cardiology treatments, including FM, markedly
improving outcomes.
The predominant physiological change observed in FM patients
is hemodynamic instability, which causes a sharp decrease in
blood pressure, low infusion of important organs and finally shock.
Although there are several different kinds of MCS devices
currently in use, the principle of MCS is to provide the patient
with the indispensable circulation support to avoid shock.
Intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) is the most commercially
available MCS device being used in treatment, where a balloon
synchronously inflates and deflates with a systolic and diastolic
heart rhythm.117 Thus, IABP can lower LV afterload and increase
the blood flow to the brain and kidneys. However, due to the
limited size of the balloon and less power of the pump, IABP can
only provide about 15% of extra circulation support compared
with the total circulation demand. In our practice, it is good
enough for most FM patients and if not enough, additional
mechanical support tool, such as extracorporeal membrane
oxygenation (ECMO) should be added.
ECMO is another useful MCS device to provide more powerful
circulation support. The flow of ECMO can be adjusted from 0.5 L/
min to 4.5 L/min, which can meet the basic demand of the body
circulation. ECMO has two different working modes. The venous to
arterial (VA) mode is designed to support body circulation and
organ infusion due to refractory heart failure.101 While the venous
to venous (VV) mode is used to support pulmonary circulation and
provide oxygenation to venous blood when acute respiratory
dysfunction syndrome (ARDS) presents.118 VA-ECMO can effec￾tively lower the preload of the heart by 40–60%119 and, therefore,
is increasingly being utilized for treating FM. In our clinical
observation in more than 100 FM patients, about 75% received
only IABP and for the remaining patients ECMO was added over
IABP, and thus the circulation was maintained well.8
Several other devices have been developed such as Impella,
which is a small pump sent into the LV to drain blood and
decrease load.88,120,121 However, limitations in an ability to reach
high flow rates and limited commercial availability restrict the
wider application of Impella. In a recent study, comparing the in￾hospital mortality rate and major bleeding between Impella and
IABP among acute myocardial infarction patients with cardiogenic
shock, use of Impella was associated with a higher in-hospital
mortality and major bleeding rates.122,123 In contrast, evidence
also suggested a trend of improved outcomes in Impella
supported patients.124 Together, this suggests a need for caution
when considering the usage of Impella for FM patients. Other
approaches employed to treat FM involve Ventricular Assistance
Devices (VAD), including Left-VAD (LVAD), Right-VAD (RVAD), and
Bi-VAD.125–127 In addition, an artificial heart has also been reported
to be applied to assist circulation and bridge FM patients to heart
transplantation.

While MCS devices have provided much-improved assistance in
the treatment of FM and help lower the mortality rate, there remain
limitations as they do not entirely provide the circulation support of
natural hemodynamics. For example, the VA mode of an ECMO
pump provides oxygenated blood directly into the descending
aorta from the femoral artery in the opposite direction of the
natural blood flow potentially causing endothelium injury due to
turbulence and increased LV afterload. Long-term usage may lead
to thrombosis, abnormalities of coagulation and infection of ECMO
loops. Impella mimics the natural blood flow direction but due to its
limited flow capability and high cost, there is limited usage outside
Europe. Due to the underlying risk of life-threatening thrombosis or
hemolysis, MCS devices are usually applied as the bridge to
recovery or further heart transplantation.128
Advancements in FM treatments following the development of
MCS devices have resulted in increased survival rates.6 However, it
is important to recognize the benefit of successful co-therapies
using proper drugs with MCS devices. Indeed, a majority of clinical
cases where MCS were applied successfully to FM patients also
showed usage of inotropic drugs like dopamine and dobutamine.
It should be noted the success rate of MCS could only reach
40–70%, in a few reports it could reach higher than 80%.6,7,108
Considering the residual mortality, we further speculate about the
other processes in FM except for “pump failure”.
2010s–present: the age of comprehensive treatments for FM
Our increased knowledge about the underlying pathophysiology
of FM, revealed it is a severe disease characterized by acute heart
failure and the occurrence of a serious inflammatory response. An
investigation into the etiology of FM demonstrates disturbances in
the immune system, overstimulation, and disrupted cytokines and
chemokines profiles, is critical.129 Upregulated cytokines or
chemokines are the natural reaction against infection but a huge
disturbance of immune homeostasis can lead to organ damage.
Pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-1, IL-6, CD-40, and TNF-α, as
well as and anti- inflammatory cytokines including sTNFR and IL￾10, are elevated in the serum of FM patients.130 These changes
observed in immune responses have been be replicated in FM
animal models.131,132
Disruption of the immune response in FM, especially T￾lymphocyte infiltration, can be observed in the majority of EMB
or postmortem samples. Moreover, the development of FM is
promoted by the over-activated immune response against those
triggers. Massive amounts of cytokines, both pro- and anti￾inflammatory, are released by locally infiltrated immune cells and
from other organs, which further destroy the immune environ￾ment of the myocardium.56,131 We have determined the plasma
cytokine profiles of FM patients and found that over 30 cytokines
were upregulated and over 10 cytokines were downregulated,
referred to as a “cytokine storm” (Fig. 2). Interestingly, sST2, the
decoy receptor of IL-33, was significantly increased when FM
patients were admitted and gradually decreased to normal levels
the patients improved. Consistent with human data, animal
experiments demonstrated normal mice treated with sST2 had
decreased heart function, while experimental FM mice showed
better survival rates when treated with an anti-sST2 antibody
(100% of anti-sST2 antibody VS 50% of FM mice). In line with our
data, it was reported plasma pro-inflammatory cytokine levels
were downregulated when MCS devices were applied to the
patients and hemodynamic conditions improved,121 which
indicated the hemodynamic state is tightly associated with the
cytokine levels. However, the underlying mechanisms need
further investigation.
By considering the current understanding of FM, especially the
roles of the cytokine storm, we established a new regimen termed
“life support-based comprehensive treatment regimen” to treat
FM.4 We emphasize the combined use of MCS and other life
support devices, including mechanical ventilator and hemodialy￾zer, together with approaches to balance the disturbed immune
response by immunomodulation therapy using sufficient dosage
of glucocorticoids (usually 200–400 mg or higher dose of
methylperidenolsone per day for few days) and IVIG but not
cytotoxic agents, such as cyclosporine or azathioprine (Fig. 6).
During the period of drug therapy (Fig. 6a), the application of
cytotoxic drugs could only gradually downregulate the cytokine
levels. However, without the administration of immunomodula￾tion therapy by glucocorticoid and IVIG, the protective such as the
promotion of nitric oxide production, attenuation of myocardium
edema, and elevation of cardiomyocyte survival effects by
glucocorticoid and beneficial effects from IVIG were absent.133
As a result, the application of cytotoxic drugs could not promote
the survival of FM patients, as The Myocarditis Treatment Trial
proved. Due to insufficient circulation support, heart function may
not able to recover rapidly and can be overwhelmed by the
cytokine storm leading to death. The application of MCS will
immediately improve heart function, however the lack of control
of cytokines costs more time to wean out MCS devices or
eventually lead to death (Fig. 6b). The combination of immuno￾modulation and MCS, which is the core of the “life support-based
comprehensive treatment regimen”, supports dysfunctional circu￾lation and attenuates an overwhelming cytokine storm (Fig. 6c).
It should be noted that in the “life support-based comprehen￾sive treatment regimen”, sufficient doses of both glucocorticoids
and IVIG were defined as immunomodulation agents, but not
immunosuppressive agents. Meanwhile, pure immunosuppressive
agents or cytotoxic, such as cyclosporine and azathioprine, which
mainly target lymphocytes were not recommended. Numerous
reports revealed the effectiveness of using IVIG in treating FM
patients by modulating the immune response and neutralizing
pro-inflammatory cytokines.132,134 In our experimental FM animal
models, application of cyclosporine showed no benefit to the
survival of myocarditis in mice (40% of cyclosporine VS 30% of
myocarditis) but IVIG prevented death when administrated either
before or after the onset in C57 mice (model for myocarditis) or A/

J mice (model for FM). The application of glucocorticoids remains
debatable and the best timing for administration of glucocorti￾coids remains unknown. It was reported in an animal model of
acute viral myocarditis the different timepoints of glucocorticoid
administration results in the different mortality rate of mice.135 It
should be noted that although the early application of gluco￾corticoid was mainly aimed at controlling the cytokine storm
rather than suppressing the overall immune response, there is a
concern it will lead to enhanced viral spread. Previous recom￾mendations suggest immunosuppressive therapy be considered
only whenever the virus load is negative in myocarditis.136
Evidence indicates the administration of glucocorticoids can
significantly improve the prognosis of patients with EMB proven
lymphocytic myocarditis, in either virus-positive or virus-negative
individuals.137 Hence, there remains a debate about the effective￾ness of glucocorticoids in FM. It is still recommended that the
application of corticoid must be with caution at the stage of
viremia. However, at the critical stage with critical illness, the
major pathophysiology is the cytokine storm rather than the
viremia, and according to our data, the majority of patients had
already experienced the onset of a cytokine storm on admission
and urgently required immunomodulation therapy. Too much
caution regarding the possibility of enhancing virus spreading by
glucocorticoid may delay live-saving treatment. Experimental
studies suggest the application of glucocorticoid to A/J mice
infected with CVB3 lowered the viral titer in heart tissue.8 Clinical
evidence also indicated that the application of glucocorticoid in
virus pneumonia and recent COVID-19 is safe and effective.138
Therefore, it can be proposed application of immunomodulatory
therapies aim to restore the homeostasis of the immune system
(Fig. 7).
Another important aspect of the “life support-based compre￾hensive treatment regimen” is anti-virus therapy. Although various
etiologies may result in FM, viral infection is still considered as the
predominant trigger. During the H1N1 flu pandemic in 2009,
several case reports indicated anti-viral agents such as oseltamivir
and zanamivir had encouraging therapeutic effects.139–141 The
beneficial effect may be related to the neuraminidase inhibitor
properties, where neuraminidase released from the injured heart
is thought to be detrimental to the heart itself.142 If the certain
infected virus can be confirmed, targeted anti-viral drugs can be
applied. Other beneficial agents have been indicated to have
dramatic effects against viral myocarditis. For example, free
immunoglobulin light chain showed antiviral and antiinflamma￾tion effects in an animal model of viral myocarditis, which
provided support to the clinical application of IVIG.143 Therapeutic
agents that can actively neutralize viral particles and demonstrate
potential anti-viral properties towards targets such as soluble
coxsackie- and adenovirus receptors144 provide insight into novel
therapies. Thus, considering the role of viral infection in FM, it
suggested anti-viral therapies be considered when making clinical
treatment decisions.
As mentioned above, the core concept of the “life support￾based comprehensive treatment regimen” is to modulate the
immune response and provide circulation support to the
deteriorated hemodynamic state via MCS. We prefer applying
IABP as the first-line MCS device. While several reports reported
the benefit of Impella in treating cardiogenic shock, recent studies
revealed that Impella might be associated with a higher risk of
major bleeding and in-hospital mortality, accompanied by a
decreased cost-effectiveness value.122,123 There are several other
treatments including anti-viral and anti-arrhythmia therapies or
using a neuraminidase inhibitor, like oseltamivir, to prevent
damage to the myocardium by the released neuraminidase. A
recent study indicated that neuraminidase is a potential cardiac
detrimental factor and a related clinical trial is being carried out to
determine the effectiveness of oseltamivir in FM (NCT03268642,
https://clinicaltrials.gov). The flow chart illustrates the process
followed when treating FM patients according to the “life support￾based comprehensive treatment regimen” (Fig. 8). It is important
to note adaptations to treatments must be made in accordance to
the current and changing status in an individual patient’s health.
PROGNOSIS OF FM
There are contradictory reports in the literature regarding the
prognosis of FM. For example, in 2000, McCarthy et al. published
data from a single-center research study, which indicated FM had
a better prognosis than acute (non-fulminant) myocarditis.102
Conversely, Ammirati et al. recently published a study demon￾strating FM, confirmed by EMB and classified into three subtypes,
exhibited worse outcomes than non-FM in 60-day outcomes and
long-term follow-up,45,145 as the 60-day mortality rate of FM
patients is 28% compared with 1.8% of non-FM patients (p =
0.0001), and the long-term follow-up (7 years) showed 47.7% of
FM patient mortality rate compared with 10.4% of non-FM
patients, respectively, (p < 0.0001) (Fig. 5).
Numerous differences in how each study was designed to
provide some insight into the opposing results in these reports. In
the first study, McCarthy’s group enrolled patients from 1984 to
1997 and among the 147 enrolled patients only 15 met the criteria
of FM; while Ammirati enrolled 165 EMB-proved FM patients and 55
non-FM patients from 2001 to 2018 resulting in a more powered
study. The EMB percentage of FM in McCarthy’s study remained
below 5% along the whole enrollment for the study and non-FM
decreased from about 20% to <5%. Importantly, the time period
between administration and EMB was shorter in Ammirati’s study
than McCarthy’s, which means persistent lymphocyte infiltrate after
the acute phase of FM. And MCS devices in McCarthy’s study were
LVAD, without IABP or ECMO, which might be due to the conditions
at that time. In the recent study, IABP, ECMO, and Impella were all
considered when stable hemodynamics cannot be sustained.8
Together, the low EMB rate and restricted MCS device choice
contributed to differential and misleading pathological diagnosis
and potentially a wrong prognosis.
Fig. 7 Illustration of the relationship of cytokine storm and
immunomodulation. The cytokine storm does not necessarily equal
to the elevation of absolute quantification of certain cytokine, but is
more likely to be the disturbance of immunohomeostasis. The effect
of immunomodulation is to restore immunohomeostasis and calm
down overreacted immune response

In contrast, in our multi-center observational study, we
compared the in-hospital mortality of 169 FM patients. Of them,
81 patients were treated with the “life support-based compre￾hensive treatment regimen” while the other 88 patients were
treated with the traditional therapy defined as “carrying out
stepped regimen of conventional medicines for heart failure and
cardiogenic shock”, e.g. vasopressor and positive inotropic drugs,
no MCS devices, no immunomodulation therapy or delayed the
application of MCS until the circulation of FM patients collapsed;
MCS devices, e.g. IABP, were only successively applied if
pharmacological therapy could not maintain circulation stability.8
Results demonstrated the “life support-based comprehensive
treatment regimen” could significantly lower the mortality rate
from 46.6 to 3.7% of all enrolled patients, and from 42.1 to 2.6% of
propensity-matched patients. These data provide evidence
supporting the comprehensive approach in the treatment of FM
and reflect experiences from multiple clinical centers in China.8 It
has been considered “of great value and can help clinical workers
treat and save more lives successfully from FM”.
146
Our therapeutic approach is supported by Ammirati’s work by
placing an emphasis on the importance of both MCS and
immunomodulation therapy.45,147 We propose this is the key to a
successful treatment of FM. However, there are some differences
between the two regimens. In our regimen, we do not recommend
the use of inotropic drugs like dopamine or dobutamine, at least,
not as dominant treatment, but MCS devices to maintain circulation
and suggest a different application rate of glucocorticoids (100% vs.
24%), IVIG (100% vs. 34%) and neuraminidase inhibitor (100% vs.
0%). In addition, we did not recommend use of cytotoxic drugs like
cyclosporine and azathioprine to suppress the immune system.
Moreover, our 1-year follow-up results (Table 2) suggest no FM
patient death was observed, supporting the idea that treatment by
“life support-based comprehensive treatment regimen” improved
the long-term outcome of FM patients. Among them, 41 of 51
patients (80.4%) showed fully recovered heart function, but there
were still 10 of 51 patients (19.6%) showed decreased EF and
enlarged left ventricular chamber or arrhythmias, which indicated
heart failure. However, the main limitation of our work is the lack of
EMB results, which hindered the pathological classification of FM.
FUTURE PERSPECTIVES REGARDING THE INVESTIGATION OF
FM
It should be emphasized FM remains primarily a clinical diagnosis
or clinical syndrome making it difficult to establish appropriate
experimental animal models. Presently, the most widely used FM
model is virally induced (usually CVB3) FM in A/J mice. However, a
viral infection, although it is the most frequent etiology, is not the
only etiology of FM restricting the translational interpretation.
Moreover, multiple different types of viruses, besides CVB3, can
induce FM. In addition, it is technically difficult and expensive to
routinely monitor hemodynamics and utilize MCS in mice.
Although the fundamental pathophysiological mechanisms
underlying FM are far from thoroughly revealed, the disturbance

Signal Transduction and Targeted Therapy (2020) 5:287 

of the immune system plays an important role in the
development and progress of FM. The evolution of treatment
regimens provide evidence emphasizing the importance of
addressing the immune response in treating FM. Unfortunately,
there is a lack of experimental models and evidence for
determining whether the pathogens directly initiate the cardiac
immune response or if the injured myocardium and subse￾quently released contents induce the immune response. The
involvement of a cytokine storm has been confirmed in various
clinical studies and animal models. The disrupted cytokine
response is potentially an important therapeutic target. The
established treatment regimens still rely on global immunomo￾dulation or immunosuppression, like that induced by IVIG or
steroid use, instead of relying on precise target interference.
Recently, evidence for therapy targeting precise cytokines has
been reported148,149 and have been excellently reviewed else￾where.150 Although there are different pathological classifica￾tions of FM, whether there is a common immune response or key
cytokine(s) is still worthy of investigation. Furthermore, target
therapy to special cytokine(s) may be promising approach.
The long-term outcome of FM has an important impact and
requires special attention. We and other researchers have
observed cardiac outcomes in a considerable proportion of
surviving FM patients often progress to dilated cardiomyopathy
(DCM) with decreased EF.99,113 It is believed the chronic immune
response has a major role in the adverse progression of FM. The
presence of anti-cardiac antibodies such as anti-MHC can be
detected in the serum of these patients, and is associated with
decreased left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF).151 The strategy
to prevent this process and which kind of immune cells take part
in this process need to be determined.
CONCLUSION: THE BEGINNING OF A NEW ERA AND
EXPLORATION
If we look back to the history of FM, we can find treatment
regimens have evolved from drug therapy, only targeting the
pump function of the heart, to a current “life support-based
comprehensive treatment” regimen, which emphasizes the
combination of MCS devices with modulation of the immune
system. The success of the approach has led to a reduction in the
mortality to <5%.8 This breakthrough in therapy for FM treatment
is easily adapted in the clinic and “has the potential to save the
lives of many young, otherwise healthy individuals”.
152
However, the mechanisms underlying FM are still not fully
revealed and the best treatment regimen for recovering patients
remains to be elucidated. During the acute phase of FM, the
future investigation should be focused on the combined
management of circulation stability and immunomodulation,
which can sustain the basal circulation of the FM patient as well
as lower the immune disturbance. New MCS devices capable of
providing more natural hemodynamic circulation support may
be needed or the ones available may need to be upgraded.
Clinical trials should be performed to develop agents or
antibodies targeting the elevated cytokines and achieving a
precise interference of elevated cytokines. For discharged
patients, the long-term cardiac remodeling process is a key
issue to be focused on. The true long-term prognosis of FM
patients still needs to be determined in future follow-up studies,
and the treatment regimen for these patients should be
determined by clinical trials.
