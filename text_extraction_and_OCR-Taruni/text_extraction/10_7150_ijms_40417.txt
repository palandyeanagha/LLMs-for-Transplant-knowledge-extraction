Abstract
Background: Fatty acid-binding protein 1 (FABP1) (also known as liver-type fatty acid-binding 
protein or LFABP) is a protein that is mainly expressed in the liver, and is associated with hepatocyte 
injury in acute transplant rejection. Reduced levels of FABP1 in mice livers have been shown to be 
effective against nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). In this study, we investigated the 
association between plasma FABP1 levels and NAFLD in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus 
(T2DM).
Methods: We enrolled 267 T2DM patients. Clinical and biochemical parameters were measured. 
The severity of NAFLD was assessed by ultrasound. FABP1 levels were determined using by 
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays.
Results: FABP1 levels were higher in patients with overt NAFLD, defined as more than a moderate 
degree of fatty liver compared to those without NAFLD. Age- and sex-adjusted analysis of FABP1
showed positive associations with body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, homeostasis model 
assessment estimate of β-cell function, creatinine, and fatty liver index, but showed negative
associations with albumin and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). The odds ratio (OR) for
the risk of overt NAFLD with increasing levels of sex-specific FABP1 was significantly increased (OR 
2.63 [95% CI 1.30-5.73] vs. 4.94 [2.25-11.48]). The OR in the second and third tertiles of FABP1
remained significant after adjustments for BMI, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, 
HbA1C, homeostasis model assessment estimate of insulin resistance, white blood cell count, 
hepatic enzymes, and eGFR.
Conclusion: Our results indicate that FABP1 may play a role in the pathogenesis of NAFLD in 
patients with T2DM.
Key words: Fatty acid-binding protein 1; nonalcoholic fatty liver disease; type 2 diabetes mellitus

Introduction
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the 
most common chronic liver condition worldwide, in 
part because obesity and insulin resistance lead to the 
accumulation of triglycerides (TGs) and free fatty 
acids in the liver. NAFLD ranges from simple 
steatosis to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) 
characterized by a fatty liver with inflammation and 
hepatocellular injury [1]. Type 2 diabetes mellitus 
(T2DM) and NAFLD often coexist [2], with a reported 
prevalence rate of NAFLD of 59.67% in T2DM 
patients [2]. Serial biopsies of patients with diabetes or 
prediabetes have shown progressive fibrosis [3], and 
it has also been suggested that the advanced forms of 
NAFLD such as NASH, advanced fibrosis, cirrhosis, 
and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) occur more 
commonly in these patients [2]. Furthermore, NAFLD 
is associated with liver-related morbidity and 
mortality [4], an increased risk of developing adverse 
cardiovascular diseases [5], and chronic kidney 
disease (CKD) [6]. NAFLD is a metabolic disorder, 
and its pathogenesis involves complex interactions
among hormonal, nutritional and genetic factors [7]. 
In addition, there is a clear association with 
dysfunctional adipose tissue, obesity, and 
dysregulated de novo hepatic lipogenesis [8].
Fatty acid-binding proteins (FABPs) are a family 
of 15-kDa proteins. Nine different FABPs have been 
identified and named according to the tissues in 
which they are found [9]. FABP1 (also known as 
liver-type fatty acid-binding protein or LFABP) is 
expressed mainly in the liver, but small quantities are 
also found in the kidneys and small intestine [9,10]. 
Previous studies on different types of FABPs have 
shown that these proteins are associated with tissue 
damage, including myocardial injury and damage to 
other organs such as the liver, kidneys, intestine and 
lungs [11-13].
FABP1 is a 14-kDa protein which is expressed in 
the hepatocytes and the proximal tubular cells of the 
kidneys, and participates in fatty acid metabolism in 
the cytoplasm [14]. Furthermore, FABP1 facilitates the 
transportation, storage, and utilization of fatty acids
and their acyl-CoA derivatives and may exert a 
protective effect against lipotoxicity by facilitating 
their oxidation or incorporation into TGs and binding 
otherwise cytotoxic-free fatty acids [15]. Some studies 
on chronic hepatitis C, NASH, and NAFLD have 
shown that serum FABP1 may be a new diagnostic 
marker to detect liver injury [16-18]. In addition, 
Petrescu et al. indicated the importance of FABP1 in 
the fibrate induction of hepatic PPARα LCFA 
β-oxidative genes, especially in the context of high 
glucose levels [19]. Because NAFLD in patients with 
T2DM is increasingly recognized to be a public health 
problem in Taiwan, a study on whether FABP1 is 
involved in NAFLD is important. Therefore, this 
study investigated the plasma FABP1 levels in 
patients with T2DM.
Methods
Participants
From January 2017 to December 2018, patients 
with diabetes who consecutively visited the diabetic 
or cardiovascular clinics at E-Da Hospital were 
studied. The diagnosis of T2DM was based on the 
World Health Organization criteria [20]. Patients 
presenting with symptoms suggestive of type 1 
diabetes, defined as diabetic ketoacidosis, acute 
presentation with heavy ketonuria (3+), or continuous 
requirement of insulin within 1 year of the diagnosis, 
were excluded. Patients with a diagnosis of hepatic 
disease, cardiovascular disease, acute or chronic 
inflammation, malignancy, and alcohol intake ≥ 30 
g/day in men or ≥ 20 g/day in women were also
excluded on the basis of interviews and physical 
examinations. The mean age of the subjects was 
67.1±9.7 years, and 68.2% were female. This study was 
approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee 
of Kaohsiung E-Da Hospital, I-Shou University 
(EDAH IRB No. EMRP-106-058). Written informed 
consent was obtained from each participant before 
enrolment.
Data collection
Alcohol intake, smoking habit, medication
history, and medical history were assessed using a 
standardized questionnaire. Body height, weight, 
waist, and hip circumferences were measured, and 
the body mass index (BMI) was calculated. The waist 
circumference was measured at the narrowest point 
between the lowest rib and the uppermost lateral 
border of the right iliac crest. The hips were measured 
at their widest point. Blood pressure was measured in 
the morning (readings were taken twice, at least 2 
minutes apart), on the right upper arm in line with the 
heart using a mercury column sphygmomanometer 
with the participant in the sitting position after a 
minimum rest period of 5 minutes. Patients who had
smoked within 1 years of the examination were 
considered to be current smokers. Those who had 
stopped smoking for more than 1 year before the
examination were considered to be nonsmokers. Most 
participants were abstainers (88%) or drank 
minimally (alcohol consumption < 20 g/day; 12% of 
total). In addition, venous blood was drawn in the 
morning after an overnight fast. Serum creatinine was 
analyzed according to the kinetic Jaffé method on a 
SYNCHRON CX System analyzer (SYNCHRON, Los

Angeles, CA) using reagents from Beckman (Beckman
Coulter Diagnostic, Los Angeles, CA). Serum TG, total 
cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol
(LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol
(HDL-C), albumin, glucose, and white blood cell 
(WBC) count were determined using standard 
commercial methods on a parallel-multichannel
analyzer (SYNCHRON, Los Angeles, CA). 
Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) was measured using high 
performance liquid chromatography. Serum alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT) was measured following the 
International Federation of Clinical Chemistry 
methods.
Estimated glomerular filtration rates (eGFRs) 
were calculated using the CKD-EPI two-concentration 
race equation [21], and the status of CKD was 
confirmed by follow-up eGFR measurements after 3 
months. We used the modified National Kidney 
Foundation classification of CKD [22]. In the present
study, an eGFR < 60 ml/min per 1.73 m2 was defined 
as CKD, and patients with stage 1 or 2 CKD (eGFR ≥ 
60 ml/min per 1.73 m2) were classified as not having 
CKD [23].
Liver ultrasonography and fatty liver index 
(FLI) calculation
All abdominal ultrasound examinations were 
performed by the same specialist. The severity of 
NAFLD on ultrasound was graded as follows: grade 1
(mild), defined as a slight diffuse increase in liver 
echogenicity in the hepatic parenchyma with normal 
visualization of the diaphragm and portal veins; 
grade 2 (moderate), defined as a moderately diffuse 
increase in liver echogenicity with a slightly impaired
visualization of the diaphragm and portal veins; and 
grade 3 (severe), defined as a marked increase in liver 
echogenicity with poor or no visualization of the 
diaphragm and portal veins. In this study, the subjects 
with grade 2 or 3 NAFLD were defined as having 
overt NAFLD.
The FLI was calculated according to a previously 
published report by Bedogni et al.[24]: FLI = 
[e0.953×loge (TGs) + 0.139×BMI + 0.718×loge
(γ-glutamyltransferase (GGT)) + 0.053×waist 
circumference-15.745)] / [1+ e0.953×loge (TGs) + 
0.139×BMI + 0.718×loge (GGT) + 0.053×waist 
circumference-15.745] ×100, with TGs measured in 
mmol/l, GGT in U/l, and waist circumference in cm.
Plasma FABP1 and insulin measurements
All blood samples were drawn after overnight 
fasting, and plasma samples were kept at -80°C for 
subsequent assay. The concentrations of plasma 
FABP1 and insulin were determined using a 
commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 
(ELISA) kits (Cloud-Clone Corp., Katy, USA and R&D 
Systems, Inc., Minneapolis, USA). The analytical 
sensitivities were 0.59 ng/mL for FABP1 and 0.881
pmol/L for insulin. ELISA was performed as per the 
instructions of the manufacturer. According to the 
manufacturer, the FABP1 ELISA had excellent 
specificity for the detection of human FABP1, and no 
significant cross-reactivity or interference with 
analogues was observed. Samples were measured in 
duplicate in a single experiment. Homeostasis model 
assessment estimate of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) 
and β-cell function (HOMA-β) values were calculated 
using equations as previously described [25].
Statistical analysis
Data normality was assessed using the 
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Continuous, normally 
distributed variables were presented as mean ± 
standard deviation, and nonnormally distributed 
variables as median (interquartile range [IQR] ). 
Statistical differences in variables were compared 
using one-way analysis of variance for normally 
distributed variables, followed by Tukey’s pairwise 
comparison. Before performing the statistical tests, 
serum or plasma levels of GGT, FABP1, fasting 
insulin, HOMA-IR, and HOMA-β were 
logarithmically transformed to achieve a normal 
distribution. Categorical variables were reported as 
frequencies and/or percentages, and inter-group 
comparisons were performed using the chi-squared 
test. These variables were assessed for independent 
associations with the presence of overt NAFLD in 
multiple logistic regression analysis using patients 
with normal and grade 1 NAFLD as the reference 
category.
Pearson’s correlation coefficients and multiple 
linear regression analysis were used to examine the 
correlations and independence between plasma 
FABP1 and the values of other parameters. In 
addition, we divided the distribution of plasma 
FABP1 levels into tertiles in a sex-specific manner. 
Anthropometric and laboratory data in each tertile 
were described and tested for trend across plasma 
FABP1 tertiles by using linear regression analysis. 
Furthermore, multiple logistic regression analysis was 
used to assess the odds ratios (ORs) for the presence 
of overt NAFLD in subjects with higher FABP1 tertiles 
compared to those with the lowest tertile. Statistical 
significance was accepted if P < 0.05. All statistical 
analyses were performed using SAS statistical 
software, version 8.2 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC).

Results
Characteristics of the subjects according to 
the severity of fatty liver
The duration of diabetes and mean HbA1C 
levels for all of the subjects overall were 15.1 years 
and 7.6%, respectively, and 66.7% of the patients had 
NAFLD. The subjects were divided into three 
subgroups according to severity of fatty liver disease: 
normal, grade 1, and grade 2 or 3 (Table 1). The 
patients with overt NAFLD (grade 2 or 3) had a 
significantly higher serum FABP1 level than those 
with grade 1 NAFLD and normal subjects (34.5
ng/mL [IQR 29.6 to 57.1] vs. 29.8 ng/mL [IQR 23.4 to 
46.5] vs. 26.6 ng/mL [IQR 20.2 to 38.5], respectively, P 
= 0.001). In addition, the patients with overt NAFLD 
had higher rates of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, 
CKD, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor and 
angiotensin II receptor blocker treatment, and stages 3 
and 4 of CKD classes, and higher diastolic blood 
pressure (DBP), BMI, waist circumference, TGs, 
creatinine, and FLI than the normal subjects and those 
with grade 1 NAFLD. Moreover, the patients with 
overt NAFLD had higher systolic blood pressure 
(SBP), waist-to-hip ratio, HbA1c, total cholesterol, 
LDL-cholesterol, aminotransferase (AST), ALT, GGT,
WBC count, fasting insulin, and HOMA-IR than the 
normal subjects. The patients with overt NAFLD also 
had lower rate of stage 1 of CKD class and lower 
levels of HDL-cholesterol and eGFR than the normal 
subjects and those with grade 1 NAFLD. There were 
no significant differences in age, male gender, 
currently smoking, oral hypoglycemic agent (OHA) 
treatment alone, OHA/insulin treatment, stage 2 of 
CKD class, diabetes duration, fasting glucose, and 
HOMA-β among the three groups.

1.01-1.03]; P = 0.001). In addition, SBP, DBP, BMI,
waist circumference, total cholesterol, TGs, 
HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, GGT, AST, ALT, 
HOMA-IR, HbA1c, eGFR, and WBC count were 
significantly associated with the presence of overt 
NAFLD (Table 2).
Association between plasma FABP1 levels and 
clinical laboratory data
Pearson’s correlation analysis showed that
plasma FABP1 levels were positively correlated with
age, BMI, waist circumference, fasting insulin, 
HOMA-β, creatinine, and FLI, and were negatively 
correlated with albumin and eGFR (Table 3). 
Furthermore, age- and sex-adjusted analysis of FABP1 
showed significant positive correlations with BMI, 
waist circumference, HOMA-β, creatinine, and FLI, 
and negative correlations with albumin and eGFR. 
However, there were no significant correlations 
between age- and sex-adjusted FABP1 and SBP, DBP, 
currently smoking, total cholesterol, TGs, 
HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, GGT, AST, ALT, 
fasting insulin, HOMA-IR, HbA1c, or WBC count.
Anthropometric and clinical laboratory 
parameters and overt NAFLD according to 
the tertile of sex-specific FABP1 levels
To investigate the impact of FABP1 plasma level 
on anthropometric and clinical laboratory parameters
and overt NAFLD, we divided the patients into three 
groups according to the tertiles of sex-specific FABP1 
plasma level. There were significant trends in the 
associations among FABP1 level and BMI, waist 
circumference, HOMA-β, albumin, creatinine, eGFR, 
and FLI (P for trend < 0.05) (Table 4). Furthermore, the 
patients in the second and third tertiles of sex-specific 
FABP1 had higher ORs for the presence of overt 
NAFLD compared to those in the lowest tertile (2.63 
[1.30-5.73] and 4.94 [2.25-11.48]). The ORs in the 
second and third tertiles of sex-specific FABP1 
remained significant after adjustments for BMI, TGs, 
HDL-cholesterol, HbA1c, HOMA-IR, WBC count, 
hepatic enzymes, and eGFR (6.09 [1.11-8.78] and 13.47 
[1.79-26.47]) (Table 5).
Discussion
In the present study, we demonstrated that 
plasma FABP1 levels were positively correlated with 
BMI, waist circumference, HOMA-β, creatinine, and 
FLI, and negatively correlated with albumin and 
eGFR. In addition, an increased plasma FABP1 
concentration was associated with overt NAFLD, 
even in a fully adjusted model. Furthermore, patients 
in the highest (third) tertile of FABP1 were 13 times 
more likely to have overt NAFLD compared to those

in the lowest tertile. These findings are in agreement 
with current evidence regarding the association
between NAFLD and FABP1 [18].

Liver diseases such as hepatitis, cirrhosis,
porphyrias, iron and copper overload, and HCC, are 
associated with notable changes in cellular lipid
metabolic homeostasis, which are usually correlated 
with changes in cellular FABP levels [26]. In the
normal liver environment, FABP1 is a key regulator of 
fatty acid metabolism [27]. Serum FABP1 levels are 
used to monitor fibrosis and hepatocellular damage 
during liver surgery [28] in both patients with 
hepatitis C virus (HCV) [16] and NASH patients [17]. 
FABP1 levels are also elevated in human HCC tissues 
[29], however the elevation observed within tumors 
does not translate into elevated levels within the 
blood. Furthermore, serum FABP1 levels are 
associated with poor survival rates in acute liver 
failure caused by acetaminophen [30]. Despite the 
strong evidence showing the effect of serum FABP1
concentration on liver diseases, the biological 
mechanisms by which FABP1 is involved in the 
pathogenesis of NAFLD are not well understood.
Hepatic oxidative stress plays a key role in the 
development of NASH/NAFLD development. FABP1
exerts a cytoprotective effect in the liver and kidneys, 
and it has also been shown to be an effective 
endogenous antioxidant [15]. By binding potentially
toxic ligands such as free fatty acids (FFAs) and heme, 
FABP1 attenuates the detergent effect of FFAs and the 
generation of reactive oxygen species by heme [15]. 
Moreover, different to other FABP family members, 
FABP1 exerts a scavenging effect through redox 
cycling of its methionine and sulfoxide reductase, 
thereby protecting cells from oxidative stress [31]. In 
contrast, a variety of mouse models and in vitro cell 
studies have shown that FABP1 regulates fatty acid 
metabolism associated with peroxisome 
proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα) in 
β-oxidation [32], and that it is involved in
hepatocellular damage as well as oxidative stress, 
thus contributing to the progression of liver disease 
through increased hepatic steatosis and the 
subsequent activation of hepatic stellate cells [33,34]. 
On the basis of these reports, we think that
endogenous FABP1 from hepatocytes may play a
significant pathophysiological role in liver disease, 
and that further studies are required to ascertain the
role of FABP1 in patients presenting with NAFLD. In 
addition, in view of its highly conserved and central 
role in lipid metabolism and transport of heme and 
other ligands, further studies are needed to elucidate 
the role of FABP1 in normal and pathological 
processes.
Our results showed positive correlations 
between plasma FABP1 levels and BMI and waist 
circumference. However, discrepancies in the 
correlation between FABP1 and obesity have been 
reported. Shi et al. [35] reported marked increases in
FABP1 in healthy obese subjects compared to 
normal-weight subjects, and that this was strongly 
correlated with central adiposity. In contrast, two 
animal studies [36,37] demonstrated that FABP1-/-
mice were protected against obesity when fed a 
high-fat diet. In addition, a previous review suggested 
that FABP1 may play an important role in preventing 
age- or diet-induced obesity [38], and thus that the 
‘‘paradoxical’’ elevation of serum FABP1 in obese 
subjects may be compensatory up-regulation to
counteract the metabolic stress imposed by obesity. In 
addition, it is possible that obesity may cause 
resistance to the action of FABP1 leading to its 
compensatory up-regulation. Given the 
cross-sectional design of the current study, no causal 
inference can be drawn. In addition, Shi et al. also 
reported that serum FABP1 was positively correlated 
with insulin resistance in humans [35]. In our patients 
with T2DM, FABP1 was not correlated with 
HOMA-IR, but it was positively correlated with 
HOMA-β. Differences in study populations, sex, and

FABP1 and HOMA index levels may partly explain 
these discrepancies.
Our results also showed that the plasma FABP1
levels were positively associated with creatinine and 
negatively associated with eGFR and albumin in 
patients with T2DM. Furthermore, higher plasma 
FABP1 and stages 3 and 4 of CKD classes in grade 2 or 
3 of NAFLD was significantly observed compared to 
normal or grade 1 of NAFLD. FABP1 is expressed in 
both normal and diseased human kidneys. Two 
studies of type 1 diabetes [39,40] and three studies of 
type 2 diabetes [41-43] reported on the relationship 
between urinary FABP1 concentrations and the 
severity of diabetic nephropathy. The results showed 
that in patients with type 1 diabetes, urinary FABP1
concentrations increased with the progression of 
diabetic nephropathy and were higher in 
normoalbuminuric patients than in control subjects 
[39,40]. These results indicated that urinary FABP1
accurately reflected the severity of diabetic 
nephropathy, and that it may be a suitable biomarker 
for the early detection of diabetic nephropathy. In an 
animal study, Kamijo-Ikemori et al. [44] found that 
the expression of FABP1 was markedly increased in 
diabetic Tg mice at 8 weeks compared with control 
mice. In addition, hexanoyl-lysine, a urinary marker 
of oxidative stress, was also significantly lower in the 
diabetic Tg mice at 8 weeks. Moreover, the levels of 
macrophage chemotactic and activating factors such 
as MCP-1 and MCP-3 were significantly suppressed 
by the expression of renal FABP1, as well as the 
expressions of TGF-β and α1COL I, which are 
associated with fibrosis. Furthermore, the expression 
of FABP1 in the kidneys significantly reduced
macrophage infiltration, deposition of type IV 
collagen, and the progression of tubulointerstitial 
damage. These results indicate that FABP1 may have 
a renoprotective function in various renal diseases.
Additional studies have also demonstrated that the 
expression of the FABP1 gene in the kidneys is 
increased by stress, such as hyperglycemia [44], 
urinary protein overload [45], renal ischemia [46], and 
toxins [47], and such stress causes tubulointerstitial
damage. FABP1 facilitates fatty-acid metabolism via 
β-oxidation and causes the excretion of lipid 
peroxidation products from tubular epithelial cells, 
thereby inhibiting the release of inflammatory factors 
and attenuating tubulointerstitial damage to achieve 
renoprotection [48]. Hence, higher plasma FABP1 and 
stages 3 and 4 of CKD classes in grade 2 or 3 of 
NAFLD and the positive association between an 
elevated FABP1 level and creatinine and the negative
association with eGFR and albumin in our patients 
with T2DM may suggest that the higher plasma 
FABP1 in grade 2 or 3 of NAFLD may be induced by 
renal dysfunction and elevations in FABP1 level may 
represent chronic or acute compensatory mechanisms 
to counteract oxidative stress and inflammation from 
diabetic nephropathy. These fact had also been 
observed in many other cytokines reported 
previously [49]. Our study provided evidence that a 
new cytokine (FABP1), may also be involved in the 
pathogenic link between NAFLD and CKD. However, 
the mechanism of action of FABP1 in renal diseases is 
unclear. Further studies are needed to elucidate the 
exact role of FABP1 in patients with diabetic 
nephropathy.
There are several limitations to this study, First,
the cross-sectional design limits our ability to infer a 
causal relationship between increased plasma FABP1
levels and the development of NAFLD. Second, our 
analyses were based on single measurements of 
plasma FABP1, which may not reflect the relationship 
over time. It would be interesting to measure serial 
changes of plasma FABP1 levels in patients with 
NAFLD to further clarify the role of FABP1 in the 
pathogenesis of NAFLD. Third, the severity of 
NAFLD was assessed using ultrasound in this study, 
but it was not confirmed pathologically. Although a 
liver biopsy is the gold standard to assess the 
pathologic grading of NAFLD, it is difficult to 
perform liver biopsies to assess NAFLD in clinical 
practice. A sensitivity of 60-94% and specificity of 
84-95% have been reported for ultrasound in the 
diagnosis of liver-biopsy confirmed fatty liver [50].
Fourth, there was no significant association between 
FABP1 and ALT, AST, or GGT in the present study. A 
previous study has reported that statistically 
significant correlations between FABP1 and AST, 
ALT, and GGT levels [18]. However, no association
has been reported between serum FABP1 level and 
AST [51]. In addition, the different disease and 
condition of the study population may have impacted 
the results.
Conclusions
In conclusion, we demonstrated that an elevated
plasma FABP1 was closely associated with NAFLD in 
patients with T2DM. Large population-based 
prospective studies are warranted to confirm whether 
FABP1 is an independent predictor of NAFLD, and 
whether it plays a causative role in the pathogenesis 
of NAFLD.
