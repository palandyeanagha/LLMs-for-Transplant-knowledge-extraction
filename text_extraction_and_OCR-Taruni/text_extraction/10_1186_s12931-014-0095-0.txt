Abstract
Primary graft dysfunction (PGD), as characterized by pulmonary infiltrates and high oxygen requirements shortly
after reperfusion, is the major cause of early morbidity and mortality after lung transplantation. Donor, recipient and
allograft-handling factors are thought to contribute, although new insights regarding pathogenesis are needed to
guide approaches to prevention and therapy. Mast cells have been implicated in ischemic tissue injury in other
model systems and in allograft rejection, leading to the hypothesis that mast cell degranulation contributes to lung
injury following reperfusion injury.
We tested this hypothesis in a mouse model of PGD involving reversible disruption of blood flow to one lung.
Metrics of injury included albumin permeability, plasma extravasation, lung histopathology, and mast cell
degranulation. Responses were assessed in wild-type (Kit+/+) and mast cell-deficient (KitW-sh/W-sh) mice. Because
mouse lungs have few mast cells compared with human lungs, we also tested responses in mice with lung
mastocytosis generated by injecting bone marrow-derived cultured mast cells (BMCMC).
We found that ischemic lung responses of mast cell-deficient KitW-sh/W-sh mice did not differ from those of Kit+/+
mice, even after priming for injury using LPS. Degranulated mast cells were more abundant in ischemic than in
non-ischemic BMCMC-injected KitW-sh/W-sh lungs. However, lung injury in BMCMC-injected KitW-sh/W-sh and Kit+/+ mice
did not differ in globally mast cell-deficient, uninjected KitW-sh/W-sh mice or in wild-type Kit+/+ mice relatively
deficient in lung mast cells.
These findings predict that mast cells, although activated in lungs injured by ischemia and reperfusion, are not
necessary for the development of PGD.
Introduction
Although lung transplantation treats otherwise incurable
lung diseases, it carries a 5-year mortality of nearly 50%.
Reperfusion injury, also known as primary graft dysfunc￾tion (PGD), is defined clinically by radiographic lung opac￾ities consistent with edema and by high requirements for
supplemental O2 during the first 72 hours of reperfusion
[1]. PGD affects up to 25% of transplanted lungs and is
the major cause of early morbidity and mortality after
transplantation. Allograft recipients surviving severe PGD
are more likely to be physiologically impaired one year
after transplantation and to be more vulnerable to conse￾quences of acute rejection. Moreover, they are more likely
to develop bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS), a
manifestation of chronic rejection [2]. Overall, PGD is a
major barrier to success of lung transplantation, and new
insights regarding pathogenesis are needed to guide
approaches to prevention and therapy [3-5].
Mast cells have been implicated in the pathogenesis of
several types of ischemia-reperfusion injury. In mouse
models of ischemia-reperfusion injury to muscle, the ex￾tent of tissue damage correlates with mast cell degranula￾tion and is markedly reduced in mice lacking mast cells.
Release of mouse mast cell protease-5, an elastolytic pro￾tease related to human mast cell chymase, appeared to be
critical the development of reperfusion injury in skeletal
muscle [6]. Mast cell-deficient mice also have a less severe
phenotype after ischemia-reperfusion injury to myocar￾dium [7]. Mast cell stabilizers and anti-histamines protect
against myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury [8]. * Correspondence: john.greenland@ucsf.edu 1

Mast cells abound at baseline in donor lung airway
walls and alveolar interstitia. Their numbers may in￾crease following transplantation and in association with
acute rejection and BOS [9,10]. Furthermore, mRNAs
encoding mast cell-specific products, such as tryptase,
are abundant in transbronchial biopsies of human allo￾grafts [11]. Studies in animals suggest that lung mast cells
also can be activated in the setting of ischemia-reperfusion.
For example, in rat tracheal allografts, mast cells de￾granulate and upregulate chemokine ligand expression
[12], and in dog lungs, mast cells appear to be recruited
and to degranulate following transient ligation of a pul￾monary artery [13]. Traditional mast cell stabilizers,
such as ketotifen and sodium cromoglycate, decrease
inflammation following lung reperfusion in rats, as
evidenced by decreased levels of ICAM-1 and TNFα
and increased NOS-2 [14,15].
There are mechanistic reasons as well to suspect a role
for mast cells in PGD. Mast cell products, especially
secreted TNFα and proteases (such as tryptases, which
are the major secreted proteins of human mast cells),
promote neutrophilic inflammation, which is a hallmark
of PGD [16-19]. Also, mast cells express adenosine re￾ceptors and are activated by adenosine [20-22], which
accumulates in ischemic tissue prior to re-establishment
of perfusion as a by-product of ATP utilization and
depletion.
One of the challenges in using mice to model roles of
mast cells in human lung pathology is that the numbers
and distribution of mast cells differ between laboratory
mice and humans. A traditional way to explore the con￾tributions of mast cells to pathology in mice is to com￾pare phenotypes in wild-type mice with those in one of
several available strains of mice lacking mast cells due to
genetic defects in expression of c-Kit. If differences are
seen, then greater certainty about mast cell involvement
can be obtained by restoring the wild-type phenotype
via adoptive transfer of wild-type bone marrow-derived
cultured mast cells (BMCMC). However, the lung is
challenging in this regard. While KitW-sh/W-sh mice lack
lung mast cells in all sites, wild-type Kit+/+ C57BL/6
mouse lung contain mast cells primarily in the trachea
and peribronchial tissues with very few in lung paren￾chyma. However, parenchymal mast cells can be observed
following intravenous injection of BMCMC into mast cell￾deficient KitW-sh/W-sh mice in a C57BL/6 background
[23-25]. The density of the mast cell population in the al￾veolar interstitium of KitW-sh/W-sh mice following intraven￾ous injection of BMCMC is substantially higher than in
wild-type Kit+/+ mice [23,26,27]. Interestingly, in humans,
alveolar interstitia support perhaps the highest density of
mast cells in any normal tissue [28]. Therefore, these
results of adoptive transfer of BMCMC into KitW-sh/W-sh
mice suggested the possibility of “humanizing” mouse
lungs with respect to alveolar mast cell density by
injecting mice with BMCMC. As a basis for conducting
the present study, we hypothesized that mast cell acti￾vation and degranulation contribute to the pathogen￾esis of PGD in lung allografts. We found that mast
cells are present and that they degranulate in human
PGD and in a mouse model of PGD with alveolar mas￾tocytosis. However, we did not detect differences in
the degree of lung injury related to the presence of
mast cells in mice, suggesting that they do not make
major contributions to ischemia-perfusion injury in
lung tissues.
Materials and methods
Studies on human tissue were performed with written
consent from the subject and with approval of the UCSF
Human Research Protection Program Committee on
Human Research (Protocol #13-10738). All non-human
animal studies were approved by the UCSF IACUC in
accordance with the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of
Laboratory Animals.
Histology
Human lung biopsy tissue sections were stained with
hematoxylin and eosin or with c-kit antibody (A4502,
Dako, Carpinteria CA). Mouse tissue was fixed in 4%
paraformaldehyde and specimens were embedded in
paraffin and cut into 5-μm sections and stained with
hematoxylin and eosin. To identify mast cells in mice
and humans, sections were deparaffinized and stained
with 0.5% acidified toluidine blue.
Mouse ischemia reperfusion model
Mast cell–deficient C57BL/6 KitW-sh/W-sh (Wsh) and
wild-type C57BL/6 Kit+/+ (+/+) mice were housed as de￾scribed [23]. For some experiments, 0.1 mg/kg of LPS
(Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis MO) was injected intraperito￾neally 24 hours before surgery. Experiments were per￾formed at 8-12 weeks of age with the exception of
adoptive transfer experiments, which were performed at
20-22 weeks to allow mast cell populations to establish
and mature in the lung. Mice were anesthetized with
ketamine and xylazine, and 0.5 mL of PBS was adminis￾tered intraperitoneally. The trachea was intubated, and
animals were mechanically ventilated (MiniVent, Harvard
Apparatus, Holliston MA) with 100% oxygen, respiratory
rate of 120/min, tidal volume of 10 ml/kg and positive
end-expiratory pressure of 3 cm of H2O. Anesthesia was
maintained with 1% vaporized isoflurane. After left
thoracotomy, the left pulmonary hilum was isolated and
circumscribed with a suture. Heparin (0.03 U/g of mouse
weight) was administered intraperitoneally and the hilar
suture was tied using a slipknot to occlude the hilar
structures, or left untied in sham surgery. The tidal

volume was reduced to 8 ml/kg and the respiratory rate
increased to 150/min. The thoracotomy was closed with
sutures and the hilar slipknot suture tunneled outside
of the chest. Buprenorphine analgesia was administered,
the animal was extubated after awakening from
anesthesia, and was allowed to recover in a warmed
chamber with supplemental O2 administered at 2 L/min.
One hour after hilar occlusion, 125I-labelled albumin
was administered intraperitoneally, the slipknot suture
was removed, and the animal was transferred to a
warmed cage. Four hours after reperfusion, animals
were euthanized by anesthetic overdose prior to blood
and lung collection. Lungs were homogenized in 1 ml of
water. Extravascular lung water was determined by the
gravimetric methods and endothelial permeability to
125I-labeled albumin was used to calculate extravascular
plasma equivalents using the equations detailed in the
Additional file 1 [29].
Mast cell adoptive transfer
BMCMC were derived by culturing bone marrow
from C57BL/6 mice for 5-6 weeks in 10 ng/ml of IL-3,
as previously described [23]. Stem cell factor (50 ng/ml)
was added to the cultures starting at weeks 3.
BMCMC (107 in 0.2 ml of PBS) were injected via tail
vein into 5-week old mice. Ischemia-reperfusion
experiments were performed at least 12 weeks after
adoptive transfer.
Statistical analysis
Differences between groups were assessed using Students
t-test or one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni-corrected
post-test comparisons between pre-specified groups
using Prism version 5.0a (GraphPad Software, Inc., La
Jolla, CA). Power calculations were performed using R
(version 3.0.2, R Foundation for Statistical Computing,
Vienna, Austria).
Results
Degranulated mast cells in human lung with PGD
Considering multiple lines of evidence supporting poten￾tial roles of mast cells in potentiating PGD, we obtained
tissue from a patient who had had a tissue biopsy done
at the time of PGD to evaluate the frequency and de￾granulation state of mast cells. In this case, the patient
had a right lower lobe lung biopsy on post-operative day
3 performed at the time of transition from veno-arterial
to veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation
following lung transplantation. Histological examination
of biopsy sections showed diffuse alveolar septal thicken￾ing with edema, type II pneumocyte hyperplasia, hyaline
membranes, and airspace neutrophilic infiltrates, consist￾ent with primary graft failure (Figure 1A). A C4d stain
was negative. Staining with antibodies specific for c-Kit

(Figure 1B) demonstrated mast cells distributed throughout
the areas of injury. Per high-powered field (0.196 mm2
),
there were 22 ± 7 mast cells. We determined that 33%
of mast cells identified by c-kit staining had irregular
borders consistent with degranulation. Toluidine blue
staining (Figure 1C) demonstrated an even greater fre￾quency of degranulation, with 59% of mast cells having
heterogeneously reduced staining. However, toluidine blue
staining may underestimate the total number of mast cells
in formalin-fixed samples [30,31]. A previous study found
14 mast cells per high power field in normal lungs, 18-32
during acute rejection, and 39 in BOS [9].
Mouse model of ischemia-reperfusion acute lung injury
The presence of degranulated mast cells in lung tissue
from a patient with PGD motivated the development of
a mouse model to test whether mast cell degranulation
contributed to ischemia-reperfusion injury. Ischemia was
induced using 1 hour of left hilar ligation followed by
4 hours of reperfusion. Compared to animals undergoing
thoracotomy and sham ligation with placement of an
untied suture, the hilum-ligated animals had significantly
increased levels of extravascular lung water and endo￾thelial permeability to albumin (extravascular plasma
equivalents) in the left lung (Figure 2). Using these re￾sults, we determined that with 5 animals per group this

ischemia-reperfusion (IR) versus in sham-operated lungs.
In these experiments, blood flow to the left lungs of wild-type
(Kit+/+) C57BL/6 mice was interrupted by hilar ligation for 1 h
followed by 4 h of reperfusion, then lung harvest (n = 6). Control mice
underwent sham ligation (n = 4). Lung water (A) and extravascular
plasma equivalents (B) were determined in the ligated and
sham-ligated lungs as parameters of lung injury.

(A-C) and with (D-F) LPS priming. (A, D) Lung water and (B, E) extravascular plasma equivalents were compared in left lungs, which were
subjected to ischemia-reperfusion, and in right lungs, which were unligated controls. Four mice were analyzed per group except in the KitW-sh/W-sh
without LPS group, in which one animal did not survive surgery. The bar graphs (C, F) show results of peripheral blood neutrophil concentrations
determined in samples obtained at the time of lung harvest.

model would have 80% power to detect a greater than or
equal to 48% change in extravascular plasma equivalents
and a 54% change in extravascular lung water in the ab￾sence of mast cells by two-sided t-test with a type I error
probability (alpha level) of 0.05.
Lung injury following ischemia-reperfusion injury in mast
cell-deficient mice
To test the hypothesis that mast cells contribute to wors￾ened injury following ischemia reperfusion, we compared
injury using this model in mast cell–deficient KitW-sh/W-sh
and wild-type Kit+/+ mice. As shown in Figure 3A-B, we
did not observe differences in extravascular lung water
(P = 0.22) or extravascular plasma equivalents (P = 0.56)
between the two mouse strains in the left (ipsilateral) or
right (contralateral) lung.
One critique of the KitW-sh/W-sh model is that mast cell
deficiency is accompanied by hematopoeitic abnormalities,
including neutrophilia [32]. As increased neutrophil infil￾tration could worsen lung injury, potentially counteracting
a possible decrease in injury resulting from absent mast
cells, we compared neutrophil counts between the two
strains following ischemia reperfusion injury (Figure 3C).
No difference in peripheral blood neutrophil counts was
observed between the two strains (P = 0.95).
Because lungs of mice raised in specific pathogen-free
conditions are not exposed to the same environmental
stimuli as transplanted lungs in humans, it has been
suggested that the mouse immune system may be rela￾tively under-primed. Indeed, we have previously shown
that mice housed in a specific pathogen-free barrier
facility require LPS priming to achieve levels of acute
lung injury similar to those seen in non-barrier mice
[33]. Accordingly, we hypothesized that pre-treatment
with LPS might amplify a possible difference in injury
between KitW-sh/W-sh and wild-type Kit+/+ animals.
As shown in Figure 3D-E, we did not observe a signifi￾cant difference between wild-type and KitW-sh/W-sh animals
with respect to the degree of ischemia-reperfusion injury
following pre-treatment with LPS. There was no difference
between extravascular lung water (P = 0.21) or extravas￾cular plasma equivalents (P = 0.28) by ANOVA. Overall,
levels of injury were comparable between the LPS
treated and untreated groups. Interestingly, we did ob￾serve an increase (P = 0.005) in the frequency of periph￾eral blood neutrophils in LPS-treated mice (Figure 3F).
We did observe a trend towards increasing extravascular
plasma equivalents in contralateral lungs of the LPS￾primed KitW-sh/W-sh animals relative to wild-type con￾trols (P = 0.10), which may be a consequence of this
systemic neutrophilia.
Adoptive transfer of mast cells results in a “humanized”
murine lung parenchyma

that mouse lung parenchyma has few mast cells compared

with human lung parenchyma, we evaluated ischemia￾reperfusion injury in a potentially more relevant mouse
model. Following adoptive transfer of mast cells by the
intravenous route, mast cells repopulate the lung paren￾chyma over a period of 4-12 weeks [23]. We assessed
ischemia-reperfusion injury in animals following injection
of BMCMC. As shown in Figure 4, lung tissue from
wild-type, KitW-sh/W-sh, and BMCMC-injected KitW-sh/W-sh
animals subjected to ischemia-reperfusion demonstrated
alveolar septal thickening, edema, and hyaline membrane
deposition, consistent with the pattern of injury seen in
human tissue with PGD. By contrast, the contralateral
lungs demonstrated minimal injury.
We assessed mast cells in lungs from animals following
adoptive transfer of BMCMC by histology (Figure 5A-D).
Injection of BMCMC led to a significant increase in
lung parenchymal mast cell density. Following ischemia￾reperfusion, as shown in Figure 5E, we observed 58 ± 10
mast cells per low powered field (LPF) in ipsilateral
lungs from BMCMC-treated KitW-sh/W-sh animals, com￾pared with 42 ± 6 mast cells in contralateral lungs from
BMCMC-treated KitW-sh/W-sh animals, <1 mast cell in
ipsilateral and contralateral lungs in wild-type animals
(P <0.001 by ANOVA). There was an increased density
of mast cells in the ipsilateral lungs of BMCMC￾treated KitW-sh/W-sh animals both when compared with
contralateral lungs (P <0.001) and when compared with
wild-type animals not treated with BMCMC (P <0.001).
As seen in Figure 5F, we found increased frequency of
degranulated mast cells following ischemia reperfusion in￾jury in ipsilateral (13 ± 5%) as compared with contralateral
lungs (5 ± 1%, P <0.01). Together, these findings show that
mast cells are present and that they degranulate in this
model, consistent with findings in human PGD.
Lung injury following ischemia-reperfusion in a mouse
with alveolar mastocytosis
To assess the role of mast cells in mediating ischemia re￾perfusion injury in this adoptive transfer model, we com￾pared measurements of lung injury between KitW-sh/W-sh
mice with and without reconstitution with BMCMC
(Figure 6). There were no significant differences in
extravascular plasma equivalents or extravascular lung
water between the with- and without-BMCMC groups
(P <0.05). To exclude the role of the KitW-sh/W-sh back￾ground as a cause for no observed difference between
the reconstituted and untreated animals, we performed
adoptive transfer of mast cells in both KitW-sh/W-sh and
Kit+/+ wild-type animals. As shown in Figure 7, we de￾tected no differences between the mastocytosis treated
animals and the untreated animals in either lung following

injury. Toluidine blue staining is shown for left lungs subjected to ischemia-reperfusion (C-D) and contralateral non-ischemic lungs (A-B) after
ischemia-reperfusion injury. Degranulation was detected by the finding of metachromatic cells with indistinct, granulated borders in tissue

ischemia-reperfusion as assessed by extravascular plasma
equivalents or extravascular lung water.
Discussion
Motivated by the observation of degranulated mast cells
in tissue obtained from a patient with PGD, we devel￾oped a mouse model of ischemia-reperfusion injury with
variation of mast cell density to evaluate the potential
role of mast cells in mediating PGD. This model recapit￾ulated the histologic hallmarks and mast cell degranula￾tion and increased mast cell density observed in human
pathology. However, we did not observe a significant
effect of mast cells across multiple permutations of this
experimental model.
Although we did not observe mast cell-dependent effects
on lung extravascular water or endothelial permeability, it
is likely that ischemia reperfusion injury results in mast
cell-dependent effects on other parameters that were not
tested. For example, pharmacologic inhibition of mast cells
during reperfusion injury has been shown to decrease
ICAM-1 and increase cGMP and NOS-2 levels following
reperfusion injury [14]. Further, mast cells are distinct from
other cell types in that secondary activation is required for
upregulation of Hypoxia-Ischemia Factor Iα in response to
ischemia [34] and hypoxia results in autocrine secretion of
IL-6, which promotes mast cell survival [35]. The unique
responses of mast cells to ischemia suggest that they may
yet play a role in ischemia reperfusion injury through
mechanisms that could not be observed in this model.
We selected ischemia and reperfusion times to achieve
a relatively severe and reproducible level of injury, but it
is possible that varying ischemia and reperfusion times

controls. Adoptive transfer of mast cells did not change the quantity of (A) lung water in the ischemic (P = 0.09) or contralateral (P = 0.23) lungs,
nor did mast cells affect the extravascular plasma equivalents (B) in ischemic (P = 0.56) or contralateral (P = 0.06) lungs.

might bring out more subtle differences related to mast
cell degranulation.
Prior studies had shown a role for mast cell degranula￾tion in mediating cardiac and skeletal muscle ischemia￾reperfusion injury [6,8] and had shown that mast cells
are present and active during ischemia-reperfusion in￾jury in tracheal and lung tissue [12,13]. The present data
suggest, however, that despite being active, mast cells do
not play a non-redundant role in mediating reperfusion
injury to the lung. Multiple independent mechanisms are
thought to contribute PGD, including oxidative stress, cal￾cium and iron overload, hypercoaguability, cell adhesion
molecule upregulation, pro-inflammatory cytokines, mem￾brane lipid remodeling, complement activation, endothelin
release, and activation of leukocytes, macrophages, lym￾phocytes, and neutrophils. Mast cells may contribute to
some, but not all of these mechanisms [36].
Beyond effects related to ischemia-reperfusion injury,
studies in mice have suggested that mast cells may help
to determine the fates of transplanted organs by effects
on immune tolerance [37]. For example, studies of skin
allografts suggested that mast cells promote tolerance
[38], because mast cell-deficient mice could not tolerate
allografts. This effect may be due to depression of IL-6
levels in the allograft by the mast cell tryptase mMCP-6
[39], which can cleave and inactivate IL-6 [19]. On the
other hand, studies in KitW-sh/W-sh mice undergoing ex￾perimental cardiac transplantation showed no significant
differences in rejection when compared to wild-type ani￾mals as manifested by graft inflammatory cells, cytokine
or adhesion molecule expression, or coronary artery dis￾ease [40]. Thus, it is possible that for adaptive immune￾mediated rejection, the contribution of mast cells to
allograft dysfunction may also be redundant.
This study has limitations. For example, a small effect
from mast cell degranulation might not be evident without
large study populations, especially given the variability
intrinsic to the utilized measures of lung injury. A
meaningful effect would likely have been evident in at
least one of the described experimental approaches. It is
also possible that mast cell degranulation has an im￾portant role in ischemia-reperfusion injury but that
other cell types can compensate for the absence of mast
cells. The lack of observed difference in wild-type ani￾mals with and without mast cells, however, suggests that
mast cell degranulation beyond what is physiologic in
mice does not lead to worsened lung injury. Although
we do not have reason to suspect that adoptively trans￾ferred mast cells would lose their functionality, we can￾not exclude the possibility that the reconstituted mast
cells have some dysfunction despite preserved ability to
degranulate. Finally, the present model employed warm
ischemia, which is physiologically distinct from the cold
ischemia present during lung transplantation because of
the metabolic changes induced by hypothermia. Similar
levels of ischemia-reperfusion injury have been reported
independent of hypothermia [41] and mast cell activation
has been reported to be unlinked to hypothermia [42].
In summary, we found that mast cell frequency did
not alter the severity of ischemia-reperfusion injury in
mouse lungs. These findings suggest that strategies target￾ing mast cells for the prevention of PGD may not be ef￾fective when used independent of other injury pathways.
