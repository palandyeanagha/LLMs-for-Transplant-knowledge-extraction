Accuracy of staging in primary biliary cirrhosis
M C Garrido, S G Hubscher
Abstract
Aims-To evaluate sampling variability of
liver biopsy in patients with primary
biliary cirrhosis (PBC).
Methods-Sections from 50 PBC liver
specimens obtained at transplantation
were examined. The degree of fibrosis was
assessed on a scale of 0-4 using two meth￾ods: (1) simulated needle biopsy in fields
approximately the size of a conventional
needle biopsy; and (2) whole section scan￾ning in areas with little and extensive
fibrosis.
Results-Considerable variation in the
range of stages of fibrosis was found when
the whole section scanning method was
used. Only 10 (20%) samples had a
consistent degree of fibrosis in all sections
scanned. By contrast, the same fibrosis
stage was assigned in 30 (60%) specimens
examined using the simulated needle
biopsy method. When the results obtained
by the two methods were compared, there
was a discrepancy of one or two stages in
32 samples. This discrepancy was the
result of discovering areas with a lesser
degree of fibrosis in whole sections com￾pared with the simulated needle biopsy
specimens.
Conclusion-There is considerable varia￾tion in the degree offibrosis in the livers of
patients with PBC, even when end stage
specimens obtained at transplantation are
examined. Consistent results were ob￾tained when simulated needle biopsy
specimens were examined. This, however,
may be a reflection of the procedure
applied when staging liver needle biopsy
specimens, where the greatest degree of
abnormality is used in determining the
stage. The practice of staging of PBC in
small needle biopsy specimens is valuable
as long as the appearances are interpreted
with caution, bearing in mind that there is
considerable variability in the degree of
fibrosis.

Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) is a relatively
uncommon disorder and mainly affects middle
aged women.' It constitutes a progressive liver
disease manifested by segmental inflammatory
destruction of intrahepatic bile ducts, resulting in
progressive loss of these ducts with associated
periportal fibrosis and eventually cirrhosis.2
Histological staging in PBC is an accepted
practice and is thought to be of prognostic
value.3 Staging is an important part of clinical
studies currently carried out in many centres
and is used routinely in some of the schemes
applied for predicting survival following liver
transplantation,4 but not in others.5
Considerable overlap between stages of PBC
has been reported.' 6 7 Rubin et ar reported
that the pattern of development of cirrhosis is
irregular within the liver in patients with PBC.8
This situation is potentially misleading when
assessing liver biopsy specimens as it might
introduce an element of sampling error and an
individual biopsy sample might not be
representative of the complete histological pic￾ture. As all of the studies on sampling variabil￾ity of liver biopsy have included cases of
cirrhosis regardless of their aetiology,9 '° we
decided to investigate sampling variability in
patients with PBC.
In order to address the problem outlined
above, we reexamined sections from a series of
50 livers obtained at transplantation from
patients with PBC.
Methods
We examined the explanted livers from a
consecutive series of 50 patients (45 women)
with a diagnosis of PBC admitted to the liver
unit at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Birming￾ham, for liver transplantation between 1991
and 1994. The mean age of the patients was
53.9 years (range 34-68 years). In all patients
the diagnosis of PBC was supported by clinical
features, positive anti-mitochondrial antibod￾ies and compatible histological features.
Specimens were sampled according to an
established protocol, in which two blocks were
obtained from the right and left lobes of the
liver. These four blocks were reexamined
systematically by one of us (MCG) and the
histological stage recorded on the basis of
appearances on haematoxylin and eosin
stained slides. For each case one block was also
stained with a set of connective tissue stains
(Van Gieson, orcein and reticulin). Every
section was examined on two separate occa￾sions: firstly, by means of scanning the whole of
the section when two stages were determined
according to the least and to the most severely
affected areas (table 1, range of stage); and sec￾ondly, from every section a needle biopsy
specimen sized field (simulated needle biopsy)
was examined and staged according to the
highest degree of abnormality noted (table 1,
stage in simulated liver biopsy specimen
according to lobe). The simulated needle
biopsy specimen from each section was ob￾tained by covering the slide with another partly
obliterated slide bearing a biopsy specimen
sized window 2 cm in length and 2 mm in
width.

Scoring system: stage 1 = no fibrosis; stage 2 = periportal fibrosis (fibrous expansion of portal
tracts without bridging); stage 3 = bridging fibrosis (portal-portal or portal-central linkage);
stage 4 = established cirrhosis.
We applied a staging system based on the
degree of fibrosis present in portal and
periportal areas: stage 1 = no fibrosis; stage 2 =
periportal fibrosis (fibrous expansion of portal
tracts without bridging); stage 3 = bridging
fibrosis (portal-portal or portal-central link￾age); stage 4 = established cirrhosis. This
represents an amalgamation of the staging sys￾2 5 11 12 tems generally in use at present.
Results
Table 1 shows the stages assigned on the basis
of haematoxylin and eosin appearances to
every patient using the two independent
staging methods. No significant differences
were observed in the additional sections exam￾ined with connective tissue stains.
ASSESSMENT OF INDIVIDUAL CASES BY WHOLE
SECTION SCANNING
When individual cases were analysed, notable
discrepancy was seen frequently when the
whole section scanning method was used. Of
the 50 cases studied, 44 had areas of estab￾lished cirrhosis (stage 4); the remaining six
cases showed variable fibrosis without true
regenerative nodules seen anywhere in the
liver. Five of these had stage 3 fibrosis and the
other stage 2, which showed conspicuous bile
duct loss. When the range of severity of fibrosis
(range of stages) was analysed (table 1), only
10 cases had a consistent degree of fibrosis
throughout all of the sections scanned. Of
these, eight cases were assigned stage 4 fibrosis
in all sections, one case stage 3 and another
stage 2. In all the remaining 40 cases, scanning
showed variable degrees of fibrosis, with 23
cases showing variation by one stage (for
example, 3-4, 2-3), 14 cases showing variation
by two stages (for example, 1-3, 2-4) and three
cases by three stages (for example, 1-4).
ASSESSMENT OF INDIVIDUAL CASES BY SIMULATED
NEEDLE BIOPSY
More consistent results were generally ob￾tained when individual cases were analysed
with the simulated needle biopsy method.
Forty one cases had at least one biopsy
specimen which showed established cirrhosis
(stage 4); the remaining nine cases showed
variable fibrosis not amounting to cirrhosis. Of
these, seven were stage 3 and two were stage 2.
Analysis of the range of stages assigned using
the simulated needle biopsy method showed
that of the 50 cases examined, 31 showed the
same stage in all four specimens examined. Of
these 27 cases were stage 4, two cases were
stage 3 and two were stage 2. In the remaining
19 cases there was variation of only one stage
(for example, 3-4, 2-3).
COMPARISON OF STAGES ASSIGNED BY THE TWO
METHODS OF EXAMINATION
No overall discrepancy was found in 18 cases
(36%) when the ranges of stages, as deter￾mined by the two methods, were compared.
Eight cases showed stage 4 fibrosis in all the
fields examined; six showed changes ranging
between stages 3 and 4; two showed changes
ranging between stages 2 and 3; one case was
stage 3; and another stage 2 by both methods.
In the remaining 32 (64%) cases, where a
discrepancy in the stages assigned was found,
there was a difference of one stage for 26
(52%) cases and of two stages for six (12%).
Table 1 shows that when the whole of the sec￾tion was scanned, 22 of a total 26 cases show￾ing a discrepancy of one stage, contained areas
with a lesser degree of fibrosis than that seen
when the sections were examined by the simu￾lated needle biopsy method; three cases
showed both a higher and lower degree of
abnormality, as determined on scanning, com￾pared with the stages obtained with the
simulated needle biopsy method (cases 18, 21
and 40). In addition, one case showed areas
with a higher degree of fibrosis on scanning
than on the simulated needle biopsy method
(case 37). The discrepancy of two degrees of
severity found in six cases (cases 3, 5, 15, 19,
29, and 42) was the result of having found
areas of liver showing a much lesser degree of
fibrosis by scanning the whole of the sections

than were found by the needle biopsy method.
Of these, four cases (cases 3, 5, 15, and 29)
were stage 4 on simulated needle biopsy and
stages as low as 2 were assigned to them by
scanning. The remaining two cases were stage
3 or 4 on simulated needle biopsy but also had
areas of stage 1 fibrosis (cases 19 and 42).
None of the cases showed two higher degrees
of abnormality when whole sections were
scanned than when examined by simulated
needle biopsy.
In summary, 28 of the 32 cases where there
was a discrepancy had areas of less severe
fibrosis when the section was examined as a
whole; six of these showed a discrepancy of two
stages. Only one case had areas with a higher
degree of fibrosis and two cases had areas of
both higher and lower degrees of abnormality
on scanning than on simulated needle biopsy.
Overall, there were no significant differences in
the stages assigned with respect to the right
and left lobes of the liver with either method.
Discussion
When one compares the four different staging
methods for PBC currently in use,2 8 11 2 they
are roughly comparable, but each may be diffi￾cult to apply. For all staging systems, the initial
lesion is portal in location, with destruction of
small bile ducts. This is referred to as the non￾suppurative destructive cholangitis or portal
hepatitis by some authors,2 or as the florid duct
lesion" or cholangitis by others.'2
Progression in PBC takes the form of
increasing fibrosis, initially limited to portal
tracts. This is followed by extension from por￾tal areas into the adjacent liver parenchyma by
two main possible mechanisms: (1) lym￾phocytic piecemeal necrosis giving rise to
appearances not unlike those of chronic active
hepatitis; or (2) bile ductular proliferation and
biliary piecemeal necrosis which may result, in
part, from the effects of cholate stasis in
periportal hepatocytes. Different staging sys￾tems have different staging criteria. Whereas
Scheuer and Popper" 12 rely on ductular prolif￾eration as the criterion for defining stage 2
PBC, Ludwig's sy§tem2 uses periportal hepati￾tis as the feature defining stage 2.
In trying to apply the above staging systems
to needle biopsy specimens, we have noted that
expanded portal tracts may show only one of
the two main patterns of damage-that is, duc￾tular proliferation or periportal hepatitis. In￾deed, in some cases, septa may fail to show
conspicuous ductular proliferation or lym￾phocytic piecemeal necrosis, whereas in others
both patterns of damage may be seen at the
same time.
For this reason in the present study we
decided to apply a simplified staging system
that was practical and easy to use. This system
relies on the presence of fibrosis and its degree
of severity, regardless of accompanying ductu￾lar proliferation or the degree of inflammation.
This simplified staging system basically repre￾sents an amalgamation of the systems referred
to earlier and is in line with concepts applied
more recently for staging fibrosis in other
forms of chronic liver disease. 13
The results of the present study demonstrate
that when applying the whole section scanning
method of examination, to sections obtained
from explanted livers from patients with PBC,
notable discrepancy in the range of severity is
seen frequently. Only 10 cases (20%) showed a
consistent degree of fibrosis throughout the
sections scanned. These observations give sup￾port to the concept of the patchy nature of
development and progression of fibrosis in
PBC. Forty four cases had areas consistent
with established cirrhosis, a finding which is
not surprising given the fact that the patients
studied were candidates for transplantation.
Rather more surprisingly, however, in six of the
50 patients studied, there was no evidence of
true cirrhosis in any of the sections examined
and in one of these there were no areas exceed￾ing stage 2 fibrosis. In this particular case there
was conspicuous bile duct loss throughout.
More consistent results were obtained when
the simulated needle biopsy method was
applied. In 31 (62%) patients the degree of
severity of fibrosis found was consistent in all
simulated needle biopsy specimens examined;
of these, the majority (27/31) were stage 4
fibrosis. As for the overall degree of severity of
fibrosis found in cases examined with this
method, a large proportion (41 cases) had
established cirrhosis.
Some of the differences observed when the
two methods of assessing the sections were
compared may simply be a reflection of the
procedure applied for staging liver needle
biopsy specimens, where the greatest degree of
abnormality noted in the specimen is taken
into account when determining the stage. This
could account for the greater degree of consist￾ency and generally higher stages noted using
the simulated needle biopsy method. However,
scanning whole sections suggested that needle
biopsy assessments may considerably overesti￾mate the degree of fibrosis. Of the 50 cases, 28
had lesser degrees of fibrosis in whole sections
compared with simulated needle biopsy speci￾mens and six of these had areas of fibrosis two
stages in severity lower than those observed in
the latter. Conversely, an area with a higher
degree of abnormality was seen in one case
only on whole section scanning than when they
were staged using the simulated needle liver
biopsy method.
It has been considered an advantage that
some models for predicting survival following
liver transplantation are based on clinical vari￾ables only and are independent of histological
staging.5 The results of the present study
support the view that the results of histological
staging should be used with caution in predic￾tive models of this sort.
Overall, these results give support to the
variability in the pattern of evolution of PBC as
reported by some' 6 7and the irregular pattern
of development of cirrhosis in PBC8 as
reported by others, a finding which, to the best
of our knowledge, had never been demon￾strated formally. These results are in agree￾ment with those of previous studies looking at
sampling variability of percutaneous liver
biopsy in patients with cirrhosis, regardless of

with the results published recently by Olsson et
al4 when similar observations were made on a
series of liver biopsy specimens from patients
with primary sclerosing cholangitis.
The practice of staging of PBC in small nee￾dle biopsy specimens is valuable as long as the
appearances in these specimens are interpreted
with caution, bearing in mind that there is con￾siderable variability in stage. The results of this
study suggest that stages obtained by examin￾ing needle biopsy specimens may overestimate
the degree of fibrosis in the liver.
