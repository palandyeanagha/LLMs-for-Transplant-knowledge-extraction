On May 8, 2020, this report was posted as an MMWR Early 
Release on the MMWR website (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr). 
On March 13, 2020, the president of the United States 
declared a national emergency in response to the coronavirus 
disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic (1). With reports of 
laboratory-confirmed cases in all 50 states by that time (2), 
disruptions were anticipated in the U.S. health care system’s 
ability to continue providing routine preventive and other 
nonemergency care. In addition, many states and localities 
issued shelter-in-place or stay-at-home orders to reduce the 
spread of COVID-19, limiting movement outside the home 
to essential activities (3). On March 24, CDC posted guid￾ance emphasizing the importance of routine well child care 
and immunization, particularly for children aged ≤24 months, 
when many childhood vaccines are recommended.*
Two data sources were examined to assess the impact of 
the pandemic on pediatric vaccination in the United States: 
Vaccines for Children Program (VFC) provider order data from 
CDC’s Vaccine Tracking System and Vaccine Safety Datalink 
(VSD) vaccine administration data. Vaccination coverage is 
the traditional metric used to assess vaccine usage; however, 
provider orders and doses administered represent two imme￾diately available proxy measures.
VFC is a national program that provides federally pur￾chased vaccines to approximately 50% of U.S. children aged 
0–18 years.† Cumulative doses of VFC-funded vaccines 
ordered by health care providers at weekly intervals during 
two periods (January 7, 2019–April 21, 2019 [period 1] and 
January 6, 2020–April 19, 2020 [period 2]) were tallied, and 
differences in cumulative weekly vaccine doses ordered between 
period 2 and period 1 were calculated for all noninfluenza 
vaccines§ that the Advisory Committee on Immunization 
Practices (ACIP) recommends for children and, as an example, 
* https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/pediatric-hcp.html. †Children aged ≤18 years are eligible if they are Medicaid-eligible, uninsured, 
American Indian/Alaska Native, or underinsured and vaccinated at federally 
qualified health centers, rural health clinics, or provider sites with an approved 
deputization agreement with the state public health department. https://www.
cdc.gov/vaccines/programs/vfc/index.html. §https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/hcp/imz/child-adolescent.html.
for measles-containing-vaccines.¶ VSD is a collaborative proj￾ect between CDC’s Immunization Safety Office and eight U.S. 
health care organizations serving publicly and privately insured 
patients.** Aggregate counts of measles-containing vaccine 
doses administered each week at VSD sites during period 2 
were compared between two pediatric age groups: children aged 
≤24 months and those aged >24 months through 18 years.
 Vaccine Tracking System data indicate a notable decrease 
in orders for VFC-funded, ACIP-recommended noninfluenza 
childhood vaccines and for measles-containing vaccines during 
period 2 compared with period 1 (Figure). The decline began 
the week after the national emergency declaration; similar 
declines in orders for other vaccines were also observed. VSD 
data show a corresponding decline in measles-containing 
vaccine administrations beginning the week of March 16, 
2020. The decrease was less prominent among children aged 
≤24 months than among older children (Figure). The sub￾sequent increase in vaccine administrations observed in late 
March was more prominent in younger than older children.
The substantial reduction in VFC-funded pediatric vac￾cine ordering after the COVID-19 emergency declaration 
is consistent with changes in vaccine administration among 
children in the VSD population receiving care through eight 
large U.S. health care organizations. The smaller decline in 
measles-containing vaccine administration among children 
aged ≤24 months suggests that system-level strategies to pri￾oritize well child care and immunization for this age group 
are being implemented. Increases in vaccine administration 
to children aged ≤24 months beginning in late March might 
reflect early success of strategies implemented by VSD health 
care organizations to promote childhood vaccinations in the 
context of the pandemic, including outreach to patients over￾due for vaccinations and changing office workflows to mini￾mize contact between patients (4). Assessment of state and local 
¶ In the United States, two measles-containing vaccines are licensed for routine 
use in children: measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine and a combination 
MMR and varicella vaccine (MMRV). The Advisory Committee on 
Immunization Practices recommends that U.S. children receive a 2-dose series 
of measles-containing vaccines at ages 12–15 months and 4–6 years.

vaccination coverage is needed to quantify the impact among 
U.S. children of all ages and prioritize areas for intervention.
The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is a reminder of the 
importance of vaccination. The identified declines in routine 
pediatric vaccine ordering and doses administered might 
indicate that U.S. children and their communities face 
increased risks for outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases. 
Parental concerns about potentially exposing their children to 
COVID-19 during well child visits might contribute to the 
declines observed (5). To the extent that this is the case, remind￾ing parents of the vital need to protect their children against 
serious vaccine-preventable diseases, even as the COVID-19 
pandemic continues, is critical. As social distancing require￾ments are relaxed, children who are not protected by vaccines 
will be more vulnerable to diseases such as measles. In response, 
continued coordinated efforts between health care providers

and public health officials at the local, state, and federal levels 
will be necessary to achieve rapid catch-up vaccination.
