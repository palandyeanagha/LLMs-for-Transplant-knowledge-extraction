Abstract
Background: Hepatic encephalopathy may manifest by a wide spectrum of neuropsychiatric symptoms, including
cognitive impairment, seizures or extrapyramidal symptoms. The liver transplant can lead to improvement of the
signs of encephalopathy but subsequent immunosuppressive treatment might possess pronounced neurotoxicity.
Case presentation: We present a case report of a patient with chronic liver disease who developed signs of
Parkinsonism after an orthotopic liver transplant, with consecutive immunosuppressant treatment with tacrolimus.
Despite the improvement of liver functions due to the cytostatic treatment, a progressive worsening of neuropsychiatric
symptoms associated with the presence of tremor was observed. Metabolic as well as endocrine dysfunctions were
excluded as the primary causes of this condition. A brain CT did not reveal structural pathology. Signs of severe,
symmetric Parkinsonism - with resting tremor, bradykinesia, rigidity and severe postural instability were observed.
A brain MRI was performed with the presence of T2- hyperintensities in basal ganglia bilaterally. Tacrolimus blood
concentration was elevated; hence the dose was reduced and later switched to less toxic sirolimus. Subsequently,
clinical signs markedly improved after treatment modification. Improvement of clinical symptomatology after
tacrolimus discontinuation supports the drug-induced etiology of this neurological condition.
Conclusions: Cytostatic treatment after solid organ transplantation often leads to signs of encephalopathy. If necessary,
the dose of cytostatics needs to be reduced, or a less toxic agent must be chosen for the therapy. This modification is
usually efficient with no further need for neurological intervention.

Background
Patients with liver disorders are prone to metabolic en￾cephalopathy – with acute hepatic failure, long-lasting
cirrhosis and portal-systemic bypass of circulation, all
representing possible causes. These may manifest in a
wide range of neuropsychiatric symptoms, including
cognitive impairment, confusion, slow speech, loss of
fine motor skills, asterixis, peripheral neuropathy, clo￾nus, decerebrate and decorticate posturing, seizures,
extrapyramidal symptoms or coma [1]. At the end stage
of chronic hepatic disease, only successful liver trans￾plantation can lead to improvement in the signs of en￾cephalopathy. However, this procedure is followed by an
immunosuppressive treatment that is well known for its
neurotoxicity. We present a case report of a patient with
chronic liver disease - without any history of prior
neurological complications, who developed signs of
Parkinsonism after a liver transplantation with subse￾quent immunosuppressant treatment.
Case presentation
The reported patient, a 51-year old woman with biopsy
proven primary billiary cirrhosis, was diagnosed in 2000.
The only complications present after determining the
primary diagnosis were: mild pancytopenia, esophageal
varices, portal gastro- and duodenopathy, and spleno￾megaly. She successfully underwent orthotopic liver
transplantation (LT) at the end of January 2016, followed
by standard immunosuppressive treatment with myco￾phenolate mofetil (Cell-cept 500 mg) and corticosteroid

treatment (methylprednison 8 mg/day). Due to labora￾tory signs of early graft rejection (8 days after LT), she
was admitted to emergency unit care. After subsequent
modification of her previous therapy to continual treat￾ment with tacrolimus (Prograf 5 mg, CZE) (10 mg/day),
an improvement in liver function was achieved. Two
weeks after the transplant and 7 days of tacrolimus treat￾ment, she developed symptoms of disorientation and
confusion. Osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS) as a
consequence of liver transplantation was also considered
in the differential diagnosis; however the onset of clinical
presentation after LT was delayed as in typical cases.
Nevertheless, no supportive signs for this diagnosis
were found (e.g. hypo/hypernatremia before LT, rele￾vant peri/post-operative fluctuation of serum sodium/
potassium and/or osmotic imbalances) [2]. No surgery
related risk factors supportive for ODS (massive bleed￾ing or higher intraoperative fluid intake) were noted
either [3]. Thus, metabolic as well as endocrine dys￾functions were ruled out as the major cause of this
condition.
Psychiatric examination was performed pointing to
brain dysfunction. The administration of tiapride,
thiamine and piracetam was initiated with no resulting
benefits. A noncontrast CT brain scan was performed
to exclude the structural pathology of the brain with
negative result. Because of progressive worsening of
consciousness and the development of tremor, neurol￾ogists were consulted. In addition to mental distur￾bances, signs of severe, symmetric Parkinsonism were
present - with resting tremor of the chin and all four
limbs (MDS-UPDRS III- 4), brady/hypokinesia (MDS￾UPDRS III - 3) and rigidity (MDS-UPDRS III –1) [4] re￾vealed by neurological examination. Furthermore, clinical
signs of severe postural instability (MDS-UPDRS III -4)
were observed. No pyramidal signs or impairment of other
systems (oculomotoric, bulbar, cerebellar) were revealed
by neurologic assessment. A brain MRI was performed
that revealed subtle hyperintensities in T2- sequences in
basal ganglia bilaterally without the abnormalities found
in the diffusion weighted images (DWI sequences) in the
MRI (Fig. 1). Thus, in regard to the chronological course
of clinical symptoms related to liver transplantation and
subsequent immunosuppressive treatment, we suggested
the onset of Parkinsonism was due to tacrolimus-induced
encephalopathy. The administration of amantadine, le￾vetiracetam (1000 mg/day) and clonazepam (initial dose
1.5 mg/day) was initiated, with a satisfactory reduction
of tremor; and with a positive effect on rigidity and
hypokinesia. The tacrolimus blood concentration was above
normal levels (21.7 ng/ml, normal value < 20 ng/ml) - the
dose was therefore reduced (8 mg/day) and 3 days later,
tacrolimus was changed to less toxic sirolimus (Rapamune
1 mg, GBR) according to standard treatment options. One
week after the treatment modification and 2 weeks after the
first onset of parkinsonian signs, the patient’s tremor and
brady/hypokinesia markedly improved (MDS-UPDRS III- 1
and MDS-UPDRS III- 1). No clinically detectable sign of ri￾gidity was found after treatment modification either. Fur￾thermore, no cognitive impairment was observed. Only a
mild degree of rest tremor (MDS-UPDRS III- 1) was
present in this patient at the time of discharge from the
hospital. Due to further improvement of extrapyramidal
symptoms, neurological medication was reduced gradually
in 3- month follow-up period checks. No clinical deterior￾ation or worsening of the condition was observed during
this period. The current treatment includes administration
of sirolimus (4 mg/day) with concomitant use of methyl￾prednisolone (2 mg/day) and mycophenolate mofetil
(500 mg/day). The sirolimus blood concentration achieved

the therapeutic range and no relevant adverse events were
observed. No additional treatment of neurological or psy￾chiatric symptoms was needed.
Improvement of clinical symptomatology after ta￾crolimus discontinuation supports the drug-induced
etiology of this neurological condition. It was the subse￾quent reasoning for not conducting a wide spectrum of
differential diagnosing. Subject consent was obtained in
agreement with the Declaration of Helsinki and an in￾formed consent from the patient is available.
Discussion and conclusions
Here we provide a rare extrapyramidal presentation
on reversible tacrolimus-induced encephalopathy in a
51-year old woman after liver transplantation. Tacroli￾mus is a very efficient immunosuppressive drug used
especially in solid organ transplantation and despite a
wide range of adverse effects tacrolimus still repre￾sents the cornerstone of immunosuppressive regimens
and the first-line treatment option after liver trans￾plantation [5]. However, approximately 30% of pa￾tients experience some form of adverse neurological
events [6]. Manifestations vary from minor complaints
(e.g. headache) to serious syndromes such as central
pontine/extrapontine myelinolysis, speech disorders or
neuromuscular complications [7, 8]. Osmotic demye￾lination syndrome (ODS) represents a severe compli￾cation which is usually attributed to a rapid correction
of hyponatremia and/or surgery related complications [3].
Symptoms of ODS occur early after surgery and may
manifest with various and not rarely atypical course [7, 9].
To date, only few cases reporting the tacrolimus￾associated central pontine myelinolysis have been re￾ported in literature [9–12].
Tacrolimus-induced neurotoxicity is usually mani￾fested as encephalopathy, but also a wide range of in￾fectious or cerebrovascular complications might occur
[6, 13]. The majority of cases manifest as posterior
reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) - with a
combination of altered consciousness, seizures, visual
abnormalities, headache, vomiting, and/or focal neuro￾logical signs [13]. We report Parkinsonism as a domin￾ant sign of encephalopathy induced by tacrolimus.
Searching for similar cases described in literature, only
one case of Parkinsonism after tacrolimus treatment
was reported in a patient with systemic lupus erythe￾matosus [14]. Another study described cyclosporine￾induced Parkinsonism in patients after liver transplant￾ation [15]. To date, only one case report of new onset
Parkinson Syndrome after LT supporting the diagnosis
of tacrolimus-induced Parkinsonism was found in re￾search databases [16].
Even though both substances are classified as im￾munosuppressive agents; the mechanism acting in the
intracellular pathways of sirolimus is different [17].
Tacrolimus reduces the expression of p-glycoprotein in
the brain endothelium, leading to dysfunction of the
blood-brain barrier and vasogenic edema [6] that most
likely result in changes to MRI-detectable intensity of
various brain regions. Our patient developed neuro￾logical signs after transplantation and subsequent im￾munosuppressive treatment with a laboratory proven
liver function improvement. Switching to a less toxic
sirolimus led to substantial recovery from all neuro￾logical complications. This fact has been previously
confirmed [13, 18]. Hence, sirolimus represents an al￾ternative in the occurrence of tacrolimus-induced ad￾verse events and is of special interest for use in hepatic
malignancies [5].
Cytostatic treatment - especially one using tacrolimus
after solid organ transplantation, often leads to signs of
encephalopathy. It may manifest by various neuropsychi￾atric symptoms, which must be taken into consideration
in every patient receiving post-transplantation immuno￾suppressive treatment. If necessary, the dose of cyto￾statics needs to be reduced, or a less toxic agent must
be chosen for the therapy. This modification is usu￾ally efficient, with no further need for neurological
intervention.
