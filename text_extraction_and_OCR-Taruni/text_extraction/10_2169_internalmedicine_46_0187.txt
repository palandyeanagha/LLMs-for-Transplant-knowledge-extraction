Abstract
Cases with proximal pulmonary artery aneurysm (PAA) sometimes have severe complications. We report 4
cases of proximal PAA complicated by pulmonary hypertension. Three cases had proximal PAA and one had
both proximal and peripheral PAA. Complications associated with proximal PAA are compression of the
bronchus, dissection and/or rupture of the pulmonary artery, and thrombus of the pulmonary artery. The
available medical treatments have limitations. Two of our patients with proximal PAA are awaiting lung
transplantation.
Key words: dissection, thrombosis, hemoptysis

Pulmonary artery aneurysm (PAA) is a rare disease (1).
Proximal PAA occasionally induces some serious complica￾tions, including compression of the bronchus, dissection
and/or rupture of the pulmonary artery, and thrombus of the
pulmonary artery. Recently, the prognosis of patients with
PH has improved with the development of new drugs (2-4).
Moreover, as non-invasive image techniques become more
widely spread, complications of PAA, which had not been
recognized as big problems previously, may be clinical
problems in the near future. The present report presents
three cases with proximal PAA and one with both proximal
and peripheral PAA.
Case Report
The first case, an 18-year-old-boy, was admitted to a local
hospital at the age of 11 because of persistent cough. A
huge pulmonary artery was observed on plain chest radiog￾raphy, and he was diagnosed as idiopathic pulmonary artery
hypertension (IPAH). He was treated with beraprost, calcium
channel blocker, warfarin, and nocturnal home oxygen. At
the age of 16 years, he was introduced to our institution and
beraprost was replaced with epoprostenol infusion. He was
classified as New York Heart Association (NYHA) func￾tional class II. His serum level of brain natriuretic peptide
(BNP) was 13.1 pg/mL (normal upper limit is 18.4 pg/mL).
Chest roentgenogram showed a huge pulmonary artery
Fig. 1A. Plain computed tomography revealed the compres￾sion of PAA on bilateral main bronchi Fig. 1B, and en￾hanced computed tomography revealed large amounts of
mural thrombus in the pulmonary arteries Fig. 1C. No muta￾tion was found in bone morphogenetic protein type II recep￾tor gene or activin-like kinase 1 gene. At present, he is 18
years old, and awaits bilateral lung transplantation. Warfarin
dose was controlled well, but his serum level of D-dimer
has been consistently high (latest value was 16,800 μg/L).
The second case, a 71-year-old woman, had been diag￾nosed as IPAH at the age of 48 years and had been treated
with warfarin, digitalis, nitrate, diuretics, calcium channel
blocker, and home oxygen therapy. At the age of 71 years,
her shortness of breath and leg edema worsened and she
was admitted to our institute. Her serum level of BNP was
670 pg/mL. After the dose of diuretics was increased and
beraprost was added, right-sided heart failure improved and
her serum level of BNP was lowered to 170 pg/mL. En￾hanced computed tomography on the fourth hospital day

showed that the inner diameter of the main pulmonary ar￾tery trunk was 80 mm and that of the right main pulmonary
artery was 58 mm. PAA compressed the bilateral main bron￾chi and mural thrombus was recognized at the right pulmo￾nary artery (Fig. 2A). From the 31st hospital day, she suf￾fered from mild fever and productive cough. Chest radiogra￾phy, computed tomography, and bronchoscopy revealed oc￾clusive pneumonia due to compression of bilateral main
bronchi by PAA (Fig. 2B and C). She died 15 days later.
The third case, a 17-year-old girl, was diagnosed as Eis￾enmenger syndrome due to atrial septal defect. At 13 years
old, she was introduced to our institute and was treated with
warfarin, beraprost, and nocturnal home oxygen. She was
classified as NYHA functional class II. Her serum level of
BNP was 23.3 pg/mL. From the age of 15, she had bloody
sputum, and from 16, she suffered from severe coughing
spells. Chest roentgenogram showed proximal PAA and pe￾ripheral PAA at the left lower lobe (Fig. 3A). Enhanced
computed tomography (Fig. 3B) and magnetic resonance
imaging showed mural thrombus in the pulmonary artery
and compression of the bilateral main bronchi by PAA. Pe￾ripheral PAAs appearing like a string of beads were ob￾served in the left lower segmental artery. Three months later,
she had hemoptysis and warfarin was stopped. She is now
17, and awaits bilateral lung transplantation. Her latest se￾rum level of D-dimer was 2,900 μg/L. She has had no epi￾sode of pneumonia or sepsis throughout her clinical course.
The fourth case, a 35-year-old woman, was diagnosed as
Eisenmenger syndrome due to the ventricular septal defect
(catheter data had been lost) and had been treated with diu-

retics, warfarin, aspirin, beraprost, and home oxygen. At the
age of 33, she was admitted to our institute for hemoptysis
and shortness of breath. Echocardiography showed a right￾to-left shunt via a ventricular septal defect. Estimated sys￾tolic and diastolic pulmonary artery pressures were 180
mmHg and 66 mmHg, respectively. Her symptoms im￾proved after digitalis was added. However, hemoptysis trig￾gered cardiac failure 192 days after admission. All oral
medications were stopped, and dopamine and dobutamine
administration were started. Oxygenation did not, however,
improve in spite of these therapies. Therefore, inhalation of
nitric oxide was first given for 35 days, from the 195th to
the 229th day of hospitalization, and she went into remis￾sion. Almost one year later, she again suffered from hemop￾tysis. Nitric oxide inhalation was again performed for 51
days until her death. Post mortem examination confirmed
the ventricular septal defect, PAA from pulmonary trunk to
the right main pulmonary artery, and thrombotic occlusion
of right pulmonary artery Fig. 4. Histological examination
showed that there was marked atherosclerosis in pulmonary
arteries.
Catheter data and complications accompanied by PAA in
our cases are summarized in Tables 1, 2.
Discussion
Aneurysms in the pulmonary artery trunk, or in the bilat￾eral main pulmonary artery are considered as proximal PAA.
The present cases 1 to 4 were of this category although case
3 also had peripheral PAA. A diameter of over 4 cm was
defined as PAA in the pulmonary artery trunk (5). PAA is
occasionally accompanied by mural thrombus in PAA, com￾pression on bronchus, and dissection and/or rupture of PAA.
As shown in Table 1, our cases also had these complica￾tions.
An autopsy report in 1947 showed that proximal PAA
was found in only eight of 109,571 cases (0.0073%) (1).
However, since no prospective studies have been focused on
PAA, the precise incidence is unknown. Etiologies for PAA
are thought to be infection, pulmonary hypertension, medial
degeneration in pulmonary artery, and arteriosclerosis (6, 7).
Pulmonary hypertension is found in 66% of proximal PAA
patients (8). In the past, syphilis was the main cause of in￾fection for PAA. Pathologically, most structural vascular ab￾normalities are acquired degenerative diseases including me￾dionecrosis and atherosclerosis (7). These abnormalities re￾sult from continual process of damage to and repair of the
vascular structures (7). In the present Case 4, atherosclerosis

of pulmonary arteries was found.
Proximal PAA itself produces no symptoms unless there
are complications such as compression on bronchus, dissec￾tion/rupture, or thrombus. PAA has been diagnosed by chest
radiography, computed tomography, magnetic resonance im￾aging, and angiography. Generally, the only therapy for PAA
with pulmonary hypertension is treatment for pulmonary hy￾pertension, if there are no complications associated with
PAA. On the other hand, proximal PAA is a potentially fatal
condition. Wekerle et al reported a case with surgical repair
of the PAA at lung transplantation (9). Medical treatments
are limited in complicated cases. Two of the present cases
(Cases 2 and 4) died. The remaining two cases (Cases 1 and
3) are awaiting lung transplantation.
Dissection
Dissection of proximal PAA is a life-threatening compli￾cation. Only 19% of dissections developed in patients with￾out pulmonary hypertension (10), and about 80% occurred
in the main pulmonary trunk (11). Sixty-seven cases with
dissection of the proximal PAA were reported including the
present case number 4 (10-13). Only ten cases (15%) were
diagnosed while living. Seven of these ten are alive (three
cases were surgically repaired and thromboendoarterectomy
was performed in one case), one died, and the prognosis
was not reported in two cases. Autopsy was performed in 52
cases, and the cause of death was cardiac tamponade in 35
cases (67%). Underlying diseases were cardiac in 36 cases,
idiopathic pulmonary artery hypertension in 10, chronic ob￾structive pulmonary disease in 5, pulmonary thromboem￾bolism in 4, iatrogenic (catheter-induced) in 2, idiopathic in
3, inflammation in 3, and unspecific in 4. Cardiac disease
was congenital in 27 cases, and persistent ductus arteriosus
was the most common. Main symptoms of dissection of
proximal PAA were chest pain and dyspnea. Dissection of
proximal PAA can be clinically diagnosed by computed to￾mography, magnetic resonance imaging, trans-thoracic echo￾cardiography, and pulmonary angiography.
Airway compression
Dilated pulmonary artery causes airway compression. For
example, large left-to-right shunts can compress mainly four
sites; left lateral trachea, superior aspect of the left main
bronchus, the origin of the left upper lobe bronchus, and the
junction of the right intermediate and right middle lobe
bronchi (14, 15). Clinically, airway compression may induce
cough and dyspnea. Airway compression was recognized in
three of our cases.
Thrombus in the pulmonary arteries
The relation between IPAH and pulmonary thrombi has
been discussed (16). Warfarin improves prognosis in IPAH
patients (17), which suggests the relation. The occurrence of
thrombus in pulmonary aneurysm was also reported (18).
Blood velocity is reduced in pulmonary hypertension be￾cause of low output, and blood congests in aneurysm. These
changes and endothelial dysfunction (19, 20) may induce a
prothrombotic state. The level of D-dimer elevated persis￾tently in two of our cases. The elevation seems to be due to
continuous formation of thrombus in the pulmonary artery.
Conclusion
Four complicated PAA patients with pulmonary hyperten￾sion were presented. Complications associated with proximal
PAA were compression of bronchus, dissection and/or rup-

ture, and thrombus of pulmonary artery. To date, the avail￾able medical treatments are limited. Two of the present pa￾tients with proximal PAA are awaiting lung transplantation.
