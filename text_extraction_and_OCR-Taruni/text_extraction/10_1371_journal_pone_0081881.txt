Abstract
Objective: To estimate the seroprevalence of cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein Barr virus (EBV) and varicella zoster
virus (VZV) among pregnant women in Bradford by ethnic group and country of birth.
Methods: A stratified random sample of 949 pregnant women enrolled in the Born in Bradford birth cohort was
selected to ensure sufficient numbers of White UK born women, Asian UK born women and Asian women born in
Asia. Serum samples taken at 24-28 weeks’ gestation were tested for CMV IgG, EBV IgG and VZV IgG. Each
woman completed a questionnaire which included socio-demographic information.
Results: CMV seroprevalence was 49% among the White British women, 89% among South Asian UK born women
and 98% among South Asian women born in South Asia. These differences remained after adjusting for socio￾demographic factors. In contrast, VZV seroprevalence was 95% among women born in the UK but significantly lower
at 90% among South Asian women born in Asia. EBV seroprevalence was 94% overall and did not vary by ethnic
group/country of birth.
Conclusions: Although about half of White British women are at risk of primary CMV infection in pregnancy and the
associated increased risk of congenital infection, most congenital CMV infections are likely to be in children born to
South Asian women with non-primary infection during pregnancy. South Asian women born in South Asia are at risk
of VZV infection during pregnancy which could produce congenital varicella syndrome or perinatal chickenpox.
Differences in CMV and VZV seroprevalence by ethnic group and country of birth must be taken into account when
universal immunisation against these viruses is contemplated.

Introduction
Cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein Barr virus (EBV) and
varicella zoster virus (VZV) are common herpesviruses which
cause persistent infections usually acquired during childhood.
Cytomegalovirus is the most common congenital infection in
the UK affecting around 3 per 1000 births [1] and can cause
neurological impairment such as hearing loss [2]. In utero
transmission of CMV can occur following primary maternal
infection during pregnancy but can also occur in women with
natural immunity, either because they reactivate latent virus or
become reinfected with a different strain [3]. CMV can also be
transmitted perinatally from mother to child where it is usually
asymptomatic, except in premature babies [4]. Postnatally,
CMV is transmitted from mother to child through breastfeeding
and close contact. In developed countries like the UK where
breastfeeding is less prevalent and of shorter duration than in
developing countries, child to child transmission of CMV is
common in day care and similar settings [5]. Early childhood
infection with CMV is usually asymptomatic or causes only
mild, flu-like symptoms. Uninfected adults in regular contact
with young children are at risk of CMV infection, of particular
significance for female childcare workers of childbearing age.
EBV is rarely transmitted in utero. EBV infection is usually
asymptomatic or causes mild, flu-like symptoms in early
childhood but can cause glandular fever if acquired in
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 November 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 11 | e81881

adolescence or adulthood [6]. In utero transmission of VZV is
also rare but can cause congenital varicella syndrome or
perinatal chickenpox [7]. In childhood VZV causes chickenpox,
but children may present with herpes zoster (shingles) without
preceding chickenpox if their first exposure to this virus was in
utero [8].
VZV vaccine is available but not part of the routine childhood
vaccination programme in the UK although has recently been
introduced for adults in their 70s to prevent shingles. Vaccines
are being developed for CMV [9,10] and EBV [11,12]. To
inform potential vaccination programmes, it is essential to
understand the current epidemiology of these infections in
childhood. Maternal seroprevalence has a significant impact on
the paediatric epidemiology of these infections, while children
frequently transmit herpesviruses to their mothers.
Little is known about differences in prevalence by ethnic
group. CMV seroprevalence is generally around 40-50%
among white populations but as high as 80-100% in some non￾white populations [13]. In a study conducted in London, UK 20
years ago, 46% of white women were CMV seropositive
compared to 88% of Asian women and 77% of black women
[14]. Similar ethnic variations in CMV seroprevalence have
been observed in the Netherlands [15] and the US [16]. There
were several other UK studies in the 1980s and 1990s to
estimate seroprevalence but no recent studies and it is not
known whether seroprevalence has changed.
EBV seroprevalence among adults is high at around 80-90%
in most populations [17,18]. In contrast to CMV and EBV, VZV
infection is acquired at older ages in many tropical countries
compared to the UK. Seroprevalence among pregnant women
is therefore often lower for those born in Asia. In a study in
East London between 2001 and 2004, VZV seroprevalence
was 93.1% in white British women, 95.2% in UK-born
Bangladeshi women and only 84.6% in women born in
Bangladesh [19].
The aim of this study was to estimate the seroprevalence of
CMV, EBV and VZV among pregnant women in Bradford by
ethnic group and country of birth.
Methods
Born in Bradford (BiB) is a longitudinal multi-ethnic birth
cohort study aiming to examine the impact of environmental,
psychological and genetic factors on maternal and child health
and wellbeing [20]. Bradford is a city in the North of England
with high levels of socio-economic deprivation and ethnic
diversity. Approximately half of the births in the city are to
mothers with South Asian origin and around half of these
women were born outside the UK and migrated for marriage.
Women were recruited while waiting for their glucose
tolerance test, a routine procedure offered to all pregnant
women registered at the Bradford Royal Infirmary, at 26-28
weeks gestation. For those consenting, a baseline
questionnaire was completed via an interview with a study
administrator.
The baseline questionnaire for the mothers was
transliterated into Urdu and Mirpuri using a standardized
process, so that words and phrases corresponded with the
original English version [21]. As Mirpuri does not have a written
form trained bilingual interviewers administered the
transliterated questionnaires to Mirpuri speakers. The
questionnaire asked about current housing, household
composition, marital status, education and current employment
of both the mother and the baby’s father, household income,
smoking, alcohol and drug use, diet, exercise and general
health.
Each woman was asked to which ethnic group she
considered she belonged from the list: White, Asian or Asian
British, Mixed ethnic group, Chinese, Black or Black British, or
Other. She was also asked to report her cultural background;
for example, for those reporting White as their ethnic group the
options were British, Irish or Other and for those reporting
Asian or Asian British as their ethnic group the cultural
background options were Indian, Pakistani, Bangladeshi,
Indian Caribbean, African Indian or Other. There were detailed
questions about the mother’s and baby’s father’s country of
birth and that of their parents and grandparents.
The full BiB cohort recruited 12,453 women during 13,776
pregnancies between 2007 and 2010, 85% of those eligible
[22], and the cohort is broadly characteristic of the city’s
maternal population.
The Allergy and Infection Study (ALL IN) is a sub-study of
BiB which aims to describe the maternal and paediatric
epidemiology of CMV, EBV and VZV and to investigate the
effect of age at infection with these viruses on immune function
and atopic allergy. Babies born since March 2008 and their
mothers who were already enrolled in BiB have been recruited
to ALL IN. A venous blood sample was collected from each
mother at recruitment to BiB at 24-28 weeks’ gestation and a
serum aliquot was stored at -80°C.
A stratified random sample of all BiB mothers with a baseline
questionnaire and a serum sample available since August 2008
(when separate aliquots were stored for ALL IN), n=3837, was
selected to include 350 white, UK born women, 300 Asian/
Asian British, UK born women and 300 Asian/Asian British
women born in South Asia who moved to the UK at 10 years of
age or older. These sample sizes were estimated to provide
power to determine biologically important differences between
groups.
The serum samples for these women were analysed at the
Royal Free Virology laboratory with chemiluminescence assays
for CMV IgG (Abbott), EBV IgG (Diasorin) and VZV IgG
(Diasorin). Briefly, the Abbott Architect i2000sr analyser used
CMV IgG kit product no 6C15-20 and protocol 531, according
to manufacturer’s instructions. The first step in this automated
immunoassay was addition of 25 μl of sample, assay diluent,
and paramagnetic microparticles coated with CMV lysate
(strain AD169) to a reaction vessel. Controls and calibrators
were run in advance of the testing, calibrations were performed
every 30 days and controls were run daily. Indirect
chemiluminscence immunoassays for VZV IgG and EBV VCA
IgG antibodies were performed using the DiaSorin Liaison
Analyser using EBV VCA-G kit ID 310510 and VZVG kit ID
058013. Kit controls were run daily and the calibrations were
run according to manufacturers’ instructions. 20μl sample was
required for each test. For EBV, the magnetic particles were

coated in p18 synthetic peptide and a mouse monoclonal
antibody linked to an isoluminol-antibody conjugate was used;
for VZV, varicella-zoster virus antigen coated the magnetic
particles and a mouse monoclonal antibody to human IgG was
linked to isoluminol-antibody conjugate.
Ethics statement
Ethical approval for this study was obtained from the
Bradford Research Ethics Committee (ref: 08/H1302/21) and
the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine Ethics
Committee (ref: 2008/5320). Women gave written informed
consent before taking part.
Statistical methods
Data were analysed using Stata version 12.1 (StataCorp.
2011. Stata Statistical Software: Release 12. College Station,
TX: StataCorp LP).
The analysis accounted for the stratified sampling design by
using svy commands in Stata. Associations between socio￾demographic variables and ethnic group/country of birth
categories or seroprevalence were tested with the design￾based F statistic. The variables included in the analysis were
identified from the literature as potential risk factors for
seroprevalence.
Adjusted risk ratio estimates were obtained using Poisson
regression adjusted by chi-squared. This method has been
shown to be a better alternative to logistic regression to directly
estimate the prevalence ratio [23].
Results
Socio-demographic characteristics by ethnic group/
country of birth category
One mother withdrew from BiB after the random sampling
was done so blood samples from 949 women were analysed.
Among the 350 white UK born women, 346 were British and 4
were Irish, hereafter referred to as White British. Of the 300
Asian UK born women, 267 considered their cultural
background as Pakistani, 25 Indian, 6 Bangladeshi, one as
British and one as Kenyan Asian, hereafter referred to as
South Asian, UK born. Among the 299 Asian women born in
South Asia, 270 considered their cultural background to be
Pakistani, 25 Indian and 4 Bangladeshi, hereafter referred to as
South Asian, South Asia born [24]. Table 1 shows the socio￾demographic characteristics of the women in each of the ethnic
group/country of birth categories. The mean age at recruitment
of the women in each group was 26.6 years (SD 5.7), 27.4
years (SD 4.9) and 28.1 years (SD 5.2) for White British, South
Asian UK born and South Asian South Asia born, respectively.
There was a pattern of increasing parity, maternal age and
household size across the groups, lowest among the white
women and highest among the women born in South Asia.
South Asian women were significantly more likely to be married
than the white women. Among the women born in South Asia,
the median age at moving to the UK was 21 years (range 10 -
37). Only 17/299 (6%) moved before age 17.
The socio-demographic characteristics of the women in this
stratified random sample were compared with the BiB cohort
overall [20] and were broadly similar with respect to maternal
age, marital status and household size (data not shown).
Seroprevalence of CMV, EBV and VZV
732 women were seropositive for CMV and 217 women were
seronegative. 888 women were EBV seropositive and 61 were
negative. 878 women were seropositive for VZV, 64 were
negative and the result was equivocal for 7 women. The
seroprevalence estimates in Table 2 account for the stratified
sampling design. Less than half of the White British women
were CMV seropositive while seroprevalence was high among
the South Asian women, even those born in the UK. VZV
seroprevalence was high among the women born in the UK
regardless of ethnic group and significantly lower among the
women born in South Asia. EBV seroprevalence was 93.6%
overall and did not vary by ethnic group/country of birth
category.
For CMV there were differences in seroprevalence between
cultural background groups for South Asian women. Among the

UK born, 68% of Indian women were seropositive compared to
91% of Pakistani women (design-based F=19.03, p<0.0001).
For those born in South Asia, 92% of Indian women were
seropositive compared to 99% of Pakistani women (design￾based F=9.02, p=0.003).
There was a trend of increasing CMV seroprevalence with
increasing parity, age and household size (Table 2). VZV
seroprevalence also rose with increasing parity and maternal
age while there was no effect of any of these variables on EBV
prevalence.
Due to differences in socio-demographic factors by ethnic
group/country of birth category, the patterns of seroprevalence
by parity, maternal age and household size were examined
separately for each group. While there was a strong trend of
increasing CMV seroprevalence with increasing parity in White
British women (39% among nulliparous women to 62% in those
with 3 or more children), there was less variation by parity
among the South Asian, UK born women; 85% of nulliparous
women were seropositive and the highest seroprevalence was
93% among women with one previous child. The women born
in South Asia had high CMV seroprevalence (>95%) regardless
of parity.
There was no clear trend of increasing CMV seroprevalence
with increasing maternal age in White British women and

seroprevalence was high for South Asian women of all ages.
The oldest group of women born in South Asia (35+ years) had
significantly lower seroprevalence (92% vs. 99% or 100% in
the other age groups, p=0.004). Household size was
significantly associated with CMV seroprevalence only among
South Asian, UK born women (78% in smallest households to
94% in larger households, p=0.0009) but no clear trend was
observed.
Conversely, the trend of increasing VZV seroprevalence with
increasing parity and maternal age was only seen among the
women born in South Asia; among the women born in the UK
VZV seroprevalence was high in all groups. Household size
was only associated with VZV seroprevalence in the UK-born
South Asian women where it was significantly lower in women
living in households of 8 or more people (85% vs. 95% or 98%
in the other groups, p=0.01).
Ethnic group/country of birth category and CMV
The association between ethnic group/country of birth
category and CMV seropositivity remained after adjustment for
parity and household size (Table 3). South Asian women born
in the UK were 1.8 times more likely to be CMV seropositive
than White British women and South Asian women born in
South Asia were nearly twice as likely to be CMV seropositive
than White British women.
Including all variables in Table 3 in the model did not alter
the results substantially; adjusted risk ratios for South Asian,
UK born and South Asian, South Asia born were 1.84 (95% CI
1.62 to 2.09, p<0.001) and 2.00 (95% CI 1.75 to 2.28, p<0.001)
respectively (n=948).
Given the differences in CMV seroprevalence between
Pakistani and Indian women, the multivariable analysis in Table
3 was re-run excluding the small groups of non-Pakistani South
Asian women, i.e. to compare White British women with UK
born Pakistani women and South Asian born Pakistani women
(n=887). There were no substantial differences in the
unadjusted or adjusted risk ratios.
To investigate the high CMV seroprevalence among South
Asian women born in the UK we analysed the data on country
of birth of their mothers. 254 (85%) were born in Pakistan, 21
(7%) in India, 6 (2%) in Bangladesh, 9 (3%) elsewhere (Kenya
7, Uganda 1, Burma 1) and only 10 (3%) in England or Wales.
Ethnic group/country of birth category and VZV
VZV seroprevalence was significantly lower among the
South Asian women born in South Asia than White British
women after adjusting for maternal age (Table 4). Also
including parity in the model did not change the estimates
substantially; adjusted risk ratios for South Asian, UK born and
South Asian, South Asia born were 0.99 (95% CI 0.95 to 1.03,
p=0.66) and 0.93 (95% CI 0.89 to 0.97, p=0.001) respectively
(n=942).
Discussion
Our results demonstrate differences in the seroprevalence of
CMV and VZV among pregnant women in Bradford according
to ethnic group and country of birth. These differences

PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 4 November 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 11 | e81881

remained after adjustment for socio-demographic differences
between the groups.
The large BiB cohort provided a unique opportunity to
investigate variation in seroprevalence by ethnic group and
country of birth and the stratified design ensured sufficient
statistical power to compare the three ethnic group/country of
birth categories. Detailed socio-demographic data were
available allowing the effect of these factors to be investigated
and adjusted for. Seroprevalence of CMV has been associated
with socio-economic deprivation in some studies [13] but not in
others [25]. As Bradford has higher levels of deprivation than
the UK national average [20], it is possible that our estimates of
seroprevalence are higher than might be found elsewhere in
the UK. However, we are confident of the differences we have

observed by ethnic group and country of birth because we
have adjusted for several socio-demographic factors which are
likely to be more proximal risk factors for seroprevalence than
general measures of socio-economic status such as household
income.
The CMV seroprevalences we observed among White British
and South Asian women were similar to those reported by
Tookey et al. [14], 46% in white women and 88% in Asian
women. They did not report seroprevalence in Asian women
separately by country of birth but stated that ‘British born
women of all ethnic groups were less likely to be seropositive
than those born elsewhere’ [14]. Their multivariable analysis
was restricted to white women born in the British Isles to
investigate the association of parity and seroprevalence so
they did not adjust for socio-demographic variables when
comparing ethnic groups. Staras et al. [16] found ethnic
differences in CMV seroprevalence, 51% among non-Hispanic
white people compared to 76% and 82% among the non￾Hispanic black and Mexican American groups, respectively.
These differences persisted after allowing for socio￾demographic factors including country of birth and were
observed in the sub-group of women of childbearing age. They

Seroprevalence of Herpesviruses in Pregnant Women
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 5 November 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 11 | e81881

did not specifically compare seroprevalence in black and
Mexican Americans born in and outside the US but found that
overall those born in other countries were more likely to be
seropositive than those born in the US.
Our VZV seroprevalence data were similar to those of
Talukder et al. who found that 93% of white British women
were VZV seropositive as were 95% of UK-born Bangladeshi
women and 85% of Bangladesh-born women [19]. Bangladesh￾born women who migrated to the UK after the age of 15 years
were significantly less likely to be VZV seropositive compared
to the white UK-born women. However, seroprevalence among
Bangladeshi women arriving in the UK aged 15 years or less or
those born in the UK was not significantly lower than that of the
white UK-born group. In our study we restricted the group of
South Asian women born in South Asia to those who moved to
the UK aged 10 years or older to distinguish between childhood
and adulthood exposure.
Our results show that ethnic group and country of birth have
a greater influence on CMV serostatus than factors such as
parity and household size, suggesting that early life exposures,
in particular breastfeeding, are more important than current
adulthood exposures. This is supported by the high
seroprevalence among Asian women born in the UK and that
97% of their mothers were born outside the UK. In the BiB
cohort Asian women are more likely to breastfeed and for
longer than white British women [26]; it is likely that this
difference also existed in the previous generation and explains
the higher CMV prevalence in Asian women. The high CMV
seroprevalence among UK-born South Asian women is likely to
fall only slowly over subsequent generations as CMV
seroprevalence in the children of these women is expected to
be higher than that of the White British children. We expect the
South Asian children to be infected with CMV earlier than the
white children as the former are likely to acquire infection from
their mothers through breastfeeding and close contact whereas
children born to seronegative mothers will become infected
through contact with other children.
We found a trend of increasing CMV prevalence with
increasing parity among the white women suggesting that child
to mother transmission is important in this group, a similar
finding to Tookey et al. [14]. The lack of a significant
association with parity among the Asian women is likely to be
because many had already acquired the infection in childhood
from their mothers and infection from their own children was
less common. In contrast to CMV, VZV seroprevalence among
South Asian women born in the UK was the same as for the
White British women. This reflects that most VZV infections are
acquired from other children at nursery or school rather than
through close maternal contact.
It is possible that in multi-ethnic populations such as
Bradford, the high CMV seroprevalence in the South Asian
community could increase seroprevalence in the White British
population, at least among the children as there is likely to be
greater contact between children at nursery and school than
between mothers. Increased child to mother transmission may
then result in a greater chance of primary infection in
pregnancy in white seronegative women. In the Netherlands
CMV seroprevalence was higher in native Dutch women living
in Amsterdam and Rotterdam, 50% and 55% respectively, than
in the south-east where it was 35%. Nearly half of the women
living in Amsterdam and Rotterdam are non-native compared
to 11% in south-eastern Netherlands [15]. This may reflect
greater transmission of the virus in the multi-ethnic
communities but may also be associated with different socio￾demographic characteristics of the metropolitan region
compared to the south-east.
The South Asian women are clearly genetically susceptible
to VZV infection, because they readily acquire this infection in
the UK. The finding of lower seroprevalence in South Asian
women born in Asia is thus compatible with less efficient
transmission of chickenpox in the Asian environment with
humidity, high temperature and ultraviolet light potentially
reducing the infectiousness of chickenpox [27,28]. South Asian
women born in South Asia are at risk of VZV infection during
pregnancy which could produce congenital varicella syndrome
or perinatal chickenpox.
About half of the White British women in Bradford are at risk
of primary CMV infection in pregnancy and the associated
increased risk of disease due to congenital infection. Children
born to South Asian women are more likely to acquire
congenital CMV infection from mothers who have natural
immunity before they become pregnant. Although this maternal
immunity may modulate the severity of fetal disease caused by
CMV, the high abundance of seropositive women means that
more babies with congenital CMV infection are born to immune
women than to those who enter pregnancy susceptible to
primary infection [29]. In the USA, approximately 75% of babies
with congenital CMV infection are born to immune women [3].
An analysis of data from the UK and Sweden showed that
around half of children with moderate or severe outcomes of
congenital CMV infection had mothers with confirmed or
presumed non-primary infection [30]. In addition to its effects in
pregnancy, recent evidence suggests an association between
CMV seropositivity and increased mortality [31] and CMV may
play a role in immunosenescence [32].
This study confirms differences in CMV and VZV
seroprevalence by ethnic group at a time when vaccination
programmes for these viruses are being considered. In
addition, we demonstrate the importance of country of birth in
determining serostatus. It has been proposed that a
vaccination programme for CMV would include vaccination of
toddlers (to reduce transmission to their mothers) and of male
and female 12 year-olds [10]. In predicting the impact of such a
vaccination programme it is important to recognise that a large
proportion of children born to South Asian women may have
already acquired CMV from their mothers at the time of
scheduled vaccination. Prototype CMV vaccines have been
shown to boost natural immunity and this effect could be
important if it provides protection against reinfection and/or
reduces the contagiousness of individuals in the community
[33-35].
