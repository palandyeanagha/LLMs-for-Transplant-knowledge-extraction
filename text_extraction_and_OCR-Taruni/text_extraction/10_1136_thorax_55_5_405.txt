In the early 1950s Lichtenstein introduced the term histiocytosis X
to describe a group of syndromes with seemingly unrelated clinical
features, but whose pathological findings were characterised by the
infiltration of involved tissues with large numbers of unusual
histiocytes, often organised as granulomas.1 Subsequently it was
shown that these histiocytes were similar to Langerhans' cells
normally present in the skin and other epithelia, a finding that led
to the current designation of Langerhans' cell histiocytosis (LCH) for
this group of disorders.2 ,3
Although the different forms of LCH are united by a common
histopathological finding—the Langerhans' cell granuloma—the
clinical spectrum of these disorders is extremely large, extending
from an acute disseminated form which usually occurs in infants
and carries a poor prognosis, to the presence of lesions localised to
a single tissue which follows a more benign clinical course
(table1).4-8 Pulmonary involvement is not unusual in systemic
forms of LCH.4-8 In this setting prognosis depends on the age of the
patients, the number of organs involved, and the extent to which
normal function is impaired.4-9 Pulmonary symptoms are rarely
prominent, although the presence or absence of lung involvement
does appear to have a bearing on the outcome.7 ,9 The lung can
also be the predominant or only site involved in LCH.4-6 ,8 ,10
Localised pulmonary LCH, the form most frequently encountered by
specialists in pulmonary medicine, occurs most commonly in young
adults and has several unique clinical and epidemiological features
that justify its classification as a distinct clinicopathological entity.4
,6 ,8 ,11-17The development of high resolution computed
tomographic (HRCT) scanning has proved to be of considerable
help in the diagnosis of this disorder.18 ,19 In contrast, the natural
history of …
