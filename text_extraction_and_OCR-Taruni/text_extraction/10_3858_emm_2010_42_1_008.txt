Abstract
This study was designed to investigate the effects of 
cAMP on immune regulation and apoptosis during 
acute rat cardiac allograft rejection. We found that the 
production of immune markers such as inflammatory 
cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α), iNOS expression, 
and nitric oxide (NO) production, was significantly in￾creased in the blood and transplanted hearts of allog￾raft recipients, but not of isograft controls. These in￾creases were effectively suppressed by the admin￾istration of the membrane permeable cAMP analog di￾butyryl cAMP (db-cAMP). Administration of db-cAMP 
reduced allograft-induced elevation of several bio￾chemical markers, such as adhesion molecule ex￾pression, iron-nitrosyl complex formation, caspase-3 
activation, and apoptotic DNA fragmentation in an ani￾mal model. Furthermore, treatment of allograft recipi￾ents with db-cAMP prolonged median graft survival to 
11 days compared with a median graft survival time of 
8 days in saline-treated allograft recipients. These re￾sults suggest that db-cAMP exerts a beneficial effect 
on murine cardiac allograft survival by modulating al￾logeneic immune response and cytotoxicity.

Introduction
Cardiac transplantation has become the predomi￾nant treatment for improving survival in patients 
with terminal stages of cardiac failure (Steinman et 
al., 2001). The success of such surgical interven￾tion is often complicated by acute graft rejection. 
Numerous studies have investigated the develop￾mental and pathological processes of the cardiac 
allograft rejection that occurs after transplantation 
to better understand the cause and to develop 
methods to prevent or manage rejection; however, 
acute allograft rejection remains the major obstacle 
to long-term survival after allograft transplantation 
(Demetris et al., 1997; Hertz et al., 2005). 
 Many types of immune process by T cells, den￾dritic cells, and macrophages are critical for allo￾graft rejection (Kim et al., 2008). Activated immune 
cells produce a variety of inflammation-associated 
genes, such as TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, interferon-γ, 
intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM-1), vascular 
cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), and iNOS 
(Langrehr et al., 1992; Lácha et al., 2002; Lattmann 
et al., 2005). These inflammatory genes have been 
suggested to be involved in the pathogenesis of 
immune-associated human diseases, including 
acute rejection of organ transplantation. Indeed, 
cytokine production was significantly increased in 
animals with allograft transplantation compared 
with isograft control. Therefore, the suppression of 
cytokine expression by anti-inflammatory drugs 
ameliorates the development of transplantation 
rejection (Swenson et al., 1995; Schrepfer et al., 
2005). These evidences indicate that allograft 
rejection is associated with the production of 
inflammatory cytokines following allograft trans￾plantation.

70 Exp. Mol. Med. Vol. 42(1), 69-79, 2010
 After allograft transplantation, elevated cytokine 
production promotes iNOS expression and NO 
synthesis (Lancaster et al., 1992). Since a large 
amount of NO production by iNOS causes 
cytotoxicity by inactivating the function of critical 
target proteins associated with ATP biosynthesis 
(Hibbs et al., 1988) and activating cell death-indu￾cing enzymes (Messmer et al., 1998), it is possible 
that NO may be an important mediator for myocyte 
necrosis, ventricular failure, and cardiac dysfunc￾tion, which are associated with rejection of the 
transplanted hearts (Yang et al., 1994). Indeed, 
inhibition of iNOS activity causes an increase in 
graft survival (Winlaw et al., 1995). Furthermore, 
mouse cardiac allografts placed in iNOS-deficient 
recipients showed reduced cardiac apoptosis 
compared with those in wild-type controls (Koglin 
et al., 1999).
 The cytotoxic molecules, TNF-α and NO, are 
capable of triggering apoptotic cell death, via the 
activation of caspase-3, which is a critical executive 
protease of apoptosis. Numerous studies have 
demonstrated that apoptosis is significantly increa￾sed in transplanted organs undergoing various 
forms of rejection (Szabolcs et al., 1996; Josien et 
al., 1998; Koglin et al., 1999). Thus, these cytotoxic 
molecules are responsible for apoptosis and dys￾function of cardiac myocytes in a cardiac allograft 
rejection model. These results suggest that cardiac 
myocyte apoptosis may contribute to the reduced 
contractile capabilities and a loss of graft function. 
These descriptive findings indicate that apoptotic 
cell death is one mechanism that contributes to 
graft failure during cardiac rejection.
 It has been shown that elevation of intracellular 
cAMP inhibits inflammation-associated gene expre￾ssion in vitro (Pahan et al., 1997; Mustafa and 
Olson, 1998), as well as promotes cell survival and 
cardiac function and contractility (Hanna et al., 
1993; Furukawa et al., 1996); however, the func￾Figure 1. Treatment with db-cAMP inhibits the expression of pro-in￾flammatory cytokines in transplanted hearts of allograft recipient rats.

tional effect of cAMP on cardiac allograft rejection, 
and its action mechanism were not clearly 
elucidated. We here examined the possible role 
and effect of the membrane permeable cAMP 
analog dibutyryl cAMP (db-cAMP) on allogeneic 
inflammation, caspase-dependent apoptotic cell 
death, and graft survival in the transplanted hearts 
of allograft recipient rats. Our data demonstrated 
that this compound inhibited allograft-mediated 
immune and biochemical events and prolonged 
graft survival. These results suggest that db-cAMP 
plays a regulatory role in allogeneic immune 
reaction in this model of acute rejection. 
Results
Administration of db-cAMP reduces 
pro-inflammatory gene expression in cardiac 
allografts
Leukocytes and T-cells recruited and trafficked to 
sites of immune reactions express a variety of 
cytokines, such as IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α, which 
are involved in the allogeneic immune response 
and allograft rejection following transplantation 
(Russell et al., 1995; Lattmann et al., 2005). We 
first examined whether db-cAMP regulates the 
expression of TNF-α, a typical inflammatory cytokine, 
in transplanted hearts from allograft recipients. The 
level of TNF-α mRNA was slightly increased in 
cardiac allografts on post-operative day (POD) 1-3, 
highly elevated on POD 5, and thereafter modera￾tely up-regulated up to POD 8, whereas TNF-α 
expression was not effectively increased in cardiac 
isografts. Peritoneal administration of db-cAMP 
significantly reduced an allograft-induced increase 
in TNF-α expression (Figure 1A). Because of the 
maximum increase in TNF-α expression at POD 5, 
we further determined the effect of db-cAMP on 
allogeneic immune and biochemical events at this 
time point. RT-PCR analysis showed that the 
mRNA levels of pro-inflammatory genes, IL-1β, 
IL-6, and TNF-α, were significantly increased in 
cardiac allografts compared with levels in cardiac 
isografts, and these increased mRNA levels were 
significantly suppressed by the administration of 
db-cAMP (Figure 1B). Similar suppressive effects 
of db-cAMP on the expression of pro-inflammatory 
cytokine genes were observed in quantitative data 
from RT-PCR analysis (Figure 1C). These results 
suggest that db-cAMP inhibits the expression of 
pro-inflammatory cytokines, which are involved in 
allograft-induced immune rejection.
Treatment with db-cAMP suppresses adhesion 
molecule expression in cardiac allografts
Inflammatory cytokines, IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-1α, 
activate the transcription factor NF-κB and 
subsequently induce the expression of adhesion 
molecules, including ICAM-1 and VCAM-1, which 
were relatively correlated both with the degree of

2008). We examined the effect of db-cAMP on the 
expression of vascular adhesion molecules in 
cardiac allografts. As expected, the representative 
data of RT-PCR showed that the expression levels 
of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 were significantly increased 
in cardiac allografts, compared with those in 
cardiac isografts (Figure 2A). These increases 
were significantly attenuated by the administration 
of db-cAMP. Similar results were obtained by 
quantitative analysis from several RT-PCR data 
(Figure 2B). These results indicate that cAMP may 
inhibit the infiltration of immune cells into allo￾grafted hearts by suppressing the expression of 
vascular adhesion molecules. 
Treatment with db-cAMP attenuates iNOS 
expression and NO production in allograft recipients 
Allogeneic immune activation increases NF-κB 
activity and subsequent induction of rejection-asso￾ciated genes, including iNOS (Lancaster et al., 
1992; Koglin et al., 1999). The expression of iNOS 
produces a large amount of NO, which may be 
involved in cytotoxicity and immune rejection (Cai 
et al., 1995). iNOS expression and NO production 
were determined by several biochemical analyses, 
such as RT-PCR, Western blotting, and EPR 
spectroscopy. RT-PCR analysis revealed a signifi￾cant increase in iNOS mRNA expression in 
allografted hearts, but not in isografted hearts, and 
this increase was effectively inhibited by admi￾nistration of db-cAMP (Figure 3A). Similar results 
were also observed in the regulation of iNOS 
protein expression by db-cAMP treatment (Figure 
3B). This result suggests that iNOS-mediated NO 
production in cardiac allografts may be involved in 
transplantation rejection. Since direct measurement 
of NO using EPR spectroscopy reveals the forma￾tion of heme- and nonheme-nitrosyl signals in 
allografted tissues (Lancaster et al., 1992; Pieper 
et al., 2003), we next examined the effect of 
db-cAMP on iron-nitrosyl complex formation, as an 
indicator of local interaction of NO to target proteins, 
in cardiac allografts. On POD 5, EPR analysis 
revealed a signal at g = 2.00, which can result from 
varying amounts of radicals or as an artifact of 
sample preparation (Pieper et al., 2003), in trans￾planted hearts from isograft recipients (Figure 3C). 
In an allograft sample on POD 5, additional signals 
were seen at positive deflections at g = 2.04 and g
= 2.08 and a triplet centered at g = 2.012 with 
hyperfine coupling of 17.5 G (Figure 3D). The EPR 
spectrum overlaps three signal components, such 
as semiquinone (g = 2.00), nonheme iron-dinitrosyl 
(g = 2.04), and heme-nitrosyl signals (g = 2.08 and 
g = 2,012 with triplet splitting of 17.5 G). The 
increased complex signal intensity in the transplan￾ted hearts in allograft recipients was markedly 
reduced by db-cAMP treatment (Figure 3C). In 
addition, the level of nitrite plus nitrate as oxidized 
products of NO was significantly elevated in the 
plasma of allograft recipient rats compared with

C for 1 h and then 
mixed with an equal volume of SDS-sample buffer. PARP cleavage activity was determined by gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. (C) Tissue ex￾tracts (40 μg protein) from transplanted hearts were separated on 14% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. Caspase-3 activation

isograft animals as a control, and this increase was 
effectively reduced by the administration of 
db-cAMP (Figure 3D). These results indicate that 
db-cAMP inhibited NO production and iron-nitrosyl 
complex formation via the suppression of transcrip￾tional iNOS expression in allogeneic heart grafts. 
Treatment with db-cAMP inhibits caspase-3 
activation and activity in allografted hearts
It has been shown that the apoptotic protease 
caspase activation and apoptotic phenomenon 
have been found in the tissues of allograft rejection 
(Ichikawa et al., 2000; Kown et al., 2000), 
suggesting that caspase activation and apoptosis 
plays a significant role in allograft rejection. We 
determined whether db-cAMP regulates caspase-3 
activity, which is a main executive protease of the 
apoptotic process in cardiac allografts. 
Caspase-3-like activity was initially increased in 
cardiac allografts on POD 3 and significantly 
elevated up to POD 8, while this enzyme activity 
was not altered in isograft controls during the entire 
experimental period. Moreover, increase in 
caspase-3-like activity in allografts were significantly 
suppressed by the administration of db-cAMP 
(Figure 4A). Since caspase-3 cleaves PARP (116 
kDa), a well-characterized biosubstrate, into 85- 
and 31-kDa fragments (Tewari et al., 1995), we 
investigated this cleavage event in allograft and 
isograft tissues. When tissue extract from cardiac 
allograft on POD 5 was incubated with 35S-labeled 
PARP, fragmentation of PARP was clearly iden￾tified by the appearance of an 85-kDa cleavage 
product, while this cleavage product was not 
observed in tissue lysates from isografted hearts 
(Figure 4B). However, the lysates of allografted 
hearts from rats treated with db-cAMP significantly 
reduced the generation of the 85-kDa fragment 
compared with untreated cardiac allografts (Figure 
4B). It has been shown that caspase-3 activity is 
directly dependent on the proteolytic activation to 
generate a heterodimeric enzyme consisting of the 
large and small subunits (Thornberry and Lazebnik, 
1998). Therefore, we investigated whether the 
administration of the membrane permeable cAMP 
analog db-cAMP would regulate caspase-3 activa￾tion in cardiac allografts. Western blot analysis 
showed that the active 17-KDa fragment of 
caspase-3 was initially generated in allografted 
hearts on POD 3 and further increased on POD 5, 
but not in isogeneic recipients, and this increased 
caspase-3 activation was significantly inhibited by 
the administration of db-cAMP (Figure 4C). These 
results suggest that db-cAMP inhibits caspase-3 
activity by suppressing proteolytic activation of 
pro-caspase-3.
Treatment with db-cAMP blocks DNA fragmentation 
in allografted hearts 
One consequence of caspase-3 activation as an 
apoptosis progress is intranucleosomal DNA 
fragmentation, which is a hallmark indicator of

cardiac allografts. Transplanted hearts were harvested on POD 5 and ho￾mogenized in nucleic acid extraction buffer. DNA was isolated by treat￾ment with proteinase K (0.5 mg/ml, 1 h at 37o
C) and extraction with mix￾ture of phenol:chloroform. DNA was prepared by ethanol precipitation 
and ribonuclease A treatment. Samples (50 μg of DNA) were separated 
on 2% agarose gel and visualized with UV light.

After transplantation of isogeneic and allogeneic hearts, rats were intra￾peritoneally administered db-cAMP (15 mg/kg/day). Cardiac rejection 
was defined by the cessation of cardiac contraction monitored by trans￾abdominal palpation (n = 6 rats/group).
apoptotic tissue destruction and cell death (Kim et 
al., 1997). To examine whether db-cAMP would 
control the tissue destruction of cardiac allograft, 
DNA fragmentation was determined following DNA 
extraction from transplanted hearts. Intranucleo￾somal DNA fragmentation was clearly identified in 
the DNA extract from cardiac allografts, while this 
fragmentation was not observed in cardiac iso￾grafts (Figure 5). Administration of db-cAMP 
significantly inhibited the DNA fragmentation 
observed in allogeneic cardiac donor (Figure 5). 
These data suggest that db-cAMP can inhibit the 
functional destruction of allografted hearts by 
suppressing apoptotic DNA fragmentation, probably 
via the inhibition of caspase-3 activation.
Treatment with db-cAMP prolongs cardiac allograft 
survival
It has been demonstrated that increases in 
inflammatory cytokine production, NO synthesis, 
and caspase-3-dependent apoptosis are highly 
correlated with functional dysfunction of allografts 
and allograft survival (Lancaster et al., 1992; 
Ichikawa et al., 2000). Therefore, we examined 
whether db-cAMP regulates cardiac allograft sur￾vival. Saline-treated recipient mice rejected all 
cardiac allografts within 9 days with a median 
survival time of 8 days in an acute rejection rat 
model, whereas no rejection was observed in 
cardiac isografts during the experimental period 
(Figure 6). Administration of db-cAMP prolonged 
cardiac allograft survival to a median survival time 
of 11 days (Figure 6). Although not shown, no 
differences in body weight and health were 
observed in both saline-treated control and 
db-cAMP-treated groups during these experiments; 
however, cardiac contractility progressively wea￾kened until no contractions could be recognized. 
These results indicate that db-cAMP may improve 
cardiac allograft survival by suppressing inflamma￾tory gene expression, NO-mediated cytotoxicity, 
and caspase-3-dependent apoptotic events.
Discussion
The present study was undertaken to elucidate the 
potential effects of the membrane permeable 
cAMP analog db-cAMP on several allograft rejec￾tion indicators, such as pro-inflammatory cytokines, 
vascular adhesion molecules, caspase-3 activation, 
and apoptotic DNA fragmentation, in an acute 
allograft animal model. We found that db-cAMP 
significantly suppressed various inflammatory gene 
expressions, NO production, caspase-3 activa￾tion/activity, and DNA fragmentation in cardiac allo￾grafts, resulting in the prolonged allograft cardiac 
survival. These data suggest that db-cAMP and 
other intracellular cAMP-elevating substances pro￾long cardiac allograft survival by suppressing 
apoptotic tissue destruction, allogeneic immune 
response, and vascular inflammation. 
 Leukocytes and T cells migrate from the host to 
allografted organs and produce various inflamma￾tory cytokines, suggesting that the host contributes 

Protective effect of cAMP on cardiac allograft rejection 75
to the rejection process (Kim et al., 2008). Circu￾lating and intra-graft levels of pro-inflammatory 
cytokines, such as IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α, are 
elevated after experimental organ transplantation 
as well as in clinical studies (Ichikawa et al., 2000). 
In fact, treatment with immunosuppressive drugs 
has been shown to prolong allograft survival via 
the inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokine expre￾ssion and production (Murase et al., 1990; Huang 
et al., 2003). We here found that the expressional 
levels of these cytokine genes were elevated in 
transplanted hearts, in which levels were reduced 
by treatment with db-cAMP. Furthermore, db-cAMP 
treatment prolonged cardiac allograft survival. 
These results suggest that cAMP analogs may 
improve allograft survival via the suppression of 
inflammatory cytokine production in response to 
allograft transplantation. 
 Inflammatory cytokines elicit NF-κB-dependent 
gene expression, including ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and 
iNOS. The vascular adhesion molecules, ICAM-1 
and VCAM-1, mediate high-affinity interactions 
between endothelium and circulating leukocytes 
and cause penetration of the immune cells into the 
surrounding tissues. The elevated expression 
levels of these adhesion molecules in cardiac 
allograft were significantly reduced by treatment 
with the immunosuppressive agents, cyclosporine 
A and FK778, resulting in abolished infiltration of 
immune cells and prolonged cardiac allograft 
survival (Schrepfer et al., 2005; Song et al., 2008). 
Moreover, transplantation of a heart from ICAM-1- 
deficient mice into allogeneic recipients resulted in 
the significant prolongation of graft survival (Lácha 
et al., 2002). These observations indicate that the 
increased expression of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 act 
as important factors for the development of cardiac 
allograft rejection. Cyclic AMP analogs have an 
anti-leukocyte adhesive action by decreasing the 
expression of vascular adhesion molecules via the 
suppression of NF-κB activation, resulting in the 
inhibition of vascular inflammation (Pober et al., 
1993; Ollivier et al., 1996; Rahman et al., 2004). 
We here found that treatment with db-cAMP 
resulted in the reduction of ICAM-1 and VACM-1 
expression in cardiac allografts. It suggests that 
db-cAMP blocks the recruitment of inflammatory 
cells into transplanted allograft organs through the 
suppression of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 expression.
 Another NF-κB-dependent gene iNOS produces 
a large amount of NO, a cytotoxic free radical, from 
L-arginine. Earlier studies have shown a correla￾tion between iNOS-mediated NO production and 
cardiac myocyte apoptosis in acute cardiac rejection 
(Lancaster et al., 1992; Szabolcs et al., 1996). 
Suppression of iNOS expression by immunosu￾ppressive strategy can reduce transplantation 
rejection (Russell et al., 1995). Most importantly, 
different measures to inhibit NOS activity prevent 
cardiac injury and prolong graft survival in an 
animal model (Winlaw et al., 1995; Worrall et al., 
1996). In addition, transplantation of normal hearts 
into iNOS-/- mouse recipients significantly reduced 
iNOS-dependent NO production, histological rejec￾tion scores, and apoptotic cell death (Koglin et al., 
1999). These observations suggest that iNOS-de￾pendent NO production in transplanted hearts of 
allograft recipients plays an important role in 
regulation of acute cardiac rejection. 
 NO highly interacts with iron-containing proteins, 
such as heme-containing proteins and iron-sulfur￾containing proteins, to form iron-nitrosyl complex, 
which can be detected by EPR spectroscopy. In 
this study, we found EPR spectrum consisting of at 
least two complex signals in cardiac allografts. The 
first signal is a typical spectrum of heme-nitrosyl 
complex that displays a nitrogen hyperfine triplet at 
g = 2.012 with a splitting of 17.5 gauss and a g = 
2.08 signal (Lancaster et al., 1992; Nakanishi et 
al., 1998; Pieper et al., 2003). The heme-nitrosyl 
complex can be generated by two different sources, 
such as hemoglobin from contaminated erythro￾cytes and myoglobin of cardiac myocytes in 
allografts (Nakanish et al., 1998). The other signal 
was the axial feature at g = 2.04, which is attr￾ibutable to the iron-nitrosyl complex of cellular 
iron-sulfur proteins, and this complex has been 
suggested to be an intracellular cytotoxic event 
(Lancaster et al., 1992; Kim et al., 2000). Our 
results suggest that db-cAMP-mediated suppression 
of transplantation rejection is due to the inhibition 
of iNOS-derived NO production and iron-nitrosyl 
complex formation in cardiac allografts. 
 Apoptotic cell death or tissue destruction is 
involved in several pathogenesis of human 
diseases, and the death of cardiac myocytes via 
apoptosis in acute cardiac allograft rejection 
becomes a significant factor leading to contractile 
dysfunction and heart failure (Laugwitz et al., 
2001). It has been shown that caspase-3-like 
activity and apoptotic cell death were dramatically 
increased in the transplanted hearts of allograft 
recipients (Ichikawa et al., 2000). Treatment with 
caspase inhibitor decreased allograft rejection in a 
rat model of acute cardiac allograft rejection (Kown 
et al., 2000). Our results showed that the apoptotic 
features including caspase-3 activation/activity and 
DNA fragmentation were significantly elevated in 
transplanted hearts of allografted recipients, indica￾ting that caspase-3-dependent apoptosis is likely 
to reduce the function of the allograft organ. In 
addition, these apoptotic events were inhibited 

76 Exp. Mol. Med. Vol. 42(1), 69-79, 2010
following treatment with db-cAMP, suggesting that 
intracellular cAMP-elevating substances can be 
used as therapeutic drugs for maintaining the 
integrity and function of the transplanted allograft 
heart.
 Enhancers of intracellular cAMP (db-cAMP and 
forskolin) inhibited iNOS expression and subse￾quent NO production in response to immune stimu￾lants, via inhibition of NF-κB activation, whereas 
H89, a specific inhibitor of PKA, stimulated NO 
production in macrophages and 3T3-L1 cells; 
however, cAMP can elevate iNOS expression in 
some other cells, including cardiac myocytes 
(Ikeda et al., 1996; Mustafa and Olson, 1998). 
These observations indicate that cAMP differen￾tially regulates iNOS expression, depending on cell 
types. Our data showed that db-cAMP inhibited 
iNOS expression and NO production, indicating 
that a major source of NO production in allograft 
recipients arises from macrophages which have 
infiltrated transplanted hearts. On the other hand, 
the suppressive effect of db-cAMP on NO produc￾tion may be due to the inhibition of inflammatory 
cytokines expressed in infiltrated immune cells, 
probably through the suppression of NF-κB 
activation. The pathological level of NO production 
showed to attenuate cardiac contractile function 
(Balligand et al., 1993). Therefore, improvement of 
cardiac contractility and allograft survival by 
db-cAMP in this study may be due to the 
suppression of NF-κB-dependent increases in 
inflammatory cytokine and iNOS expression. In 
addition, cAMP has been demonstrated to inhibit 
apoptosis by suppressing the activation of multiple 
caspases (Li et al., 2000). We showed that 
db-cAMP inhibited caspase-3 activation and 
activity. Thus, the protective effect of db-cAMP on 
acute cardiac allografts is likely to suppress both 
caspase-3 activation and cytotoxic NO production 
in allograft recipients. 
 In conclusion, treatment with db-cAMP inhibited 
increases in various immune and biochemical 
markers of transplantation rejection in cardiac allo￾grafts. These results indicate that db-cAMP promo￾tes cardiac function via the suppression of allo￾geneic inflammation elicited by infiltrated inflamma￾tory cells and the inhibition of caspase- and 
NO-mediated cardiac dysfunction in allograft reci￾pients. These effects are likely to be associated 
with the prolongation of cardiac allograft survival. 
These results indicate that intracellular 
cAMP-elevating compounds can be used as a 
therapeutic drug for improving allograft function 
and survival, potentially rendering a more 
therapeutic effect in combination with other agents 
including immune suppressants. 
Methods
Surgical procedures and animal treatment
Male Brown Norway (BN, RT1n
) and Lewis (LEW, RT1l
) 
rats were purchased from Daehan Biolink (Daejeon, 
Korea). Animals were kept in a specific pathogen-free 
animal facility and fed a standard diet and water ad libitum. 
Maintenance of the animals and performance of all 
experiments conformed to the guidelines of the Council of 
Animal Care at Kangwon National University. Hearts from 
200 to 250 g naive LEW donors were transplanted to the 
abdominal aorta and vena cava of 250 to 300 g BN 
recipients or isograft controls to LEW recipients as 
previously reported (Ono and Lindsey, 1969). Isolated 
hearts were kept in lactated Ringer's solution (Baxter 
Healthcare Corp., Chicago, IL) supplemented with 2 mM 
db-cAMP at 4o
C for 40 to 60 min. After surgical trans￾plantation of hearts, rats were kept in a specific 
pathogen-free animal facility and fed a standard diet and 
water ad libitum. For animal treatment, db-cAMP (MW, 
491) was given at 15 mg/kg/day by single daily intraperi￾toneal injection during entire the experimental period.
RT-PCR and quantitative real-time PCR (qrPCR)
Total RNAs from transplanted hearts were isolated using 
the Trizol reagent kit (Life Technology Inc.). RT-PCR was 
performed as follows. Five μg of mRNA was converted to 
cDNA by treatment with 200 units of reverse transcriptase 
and 500 ng of oligo-dT18 primer in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 
8.3), 75 mM KCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 10 mM DTT, and 1 mM 
dNTPs at 42o
C for 1 h. The reaction was stopped by 
heating at 70o
C for 15 min, and 1 μl of cDNA mixture was 
used for enzymatic amplification. PCR was performed in 
50 mM KCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 
mM dNTPs, 2.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase, and 0.1 μM 
each of primers for several target genes. The PCR 
reactions were as follows: denaturation, 95o
C for 1 min; 
annealing, 55o
C for 1 min; extension, 72o
C for 2 min for 25 
cycles, followed by 7 min at 68o
C for final extension. The 
RT-PCR products were separated on 1.5% agarose gel 
and visualized then with EtBr staining. Band density was 
determined by densitometry using a computer-assisted 
image analyzer. qrPCR was performed using the ABI 
PRISM 7000 Sequence Detection System (Applied 
Biosystems) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 
The 25 μl reaction mixture consisted of in iTaq SYBR 
Green Supermix (Bio-Rad), 0.5 μl of cDNA mixture and the 
appropriate primers (100 pmol/μl). The PCR machine was 
programmed for the initial step of 2 min at 50o
C and 10 min 
at 95o
C, followed by 50 cycles of 15 s at 95o
C and 1 min at 
60o
C. Relative quantitation of gene expression was deter￾mined using comparative threshold multiplex PCR in the 
same tube after validating that the efficiencies of the target 
gene and GAPDH products were approximately equal. The 
primers used in this experiment were as follows; 5'-CCT￾CACACTCAGATCATCTTCTCA-3' (sense) and 5'-CTCCT￾CTGCTTGGTGGTTTGC-3' (antisense) for TNF-α, 5'-AGT￾TGCCTTCTTGGGACTGA-3' (sense) and 5'-TGGGTGGT￾ATCCTCTGTGAAG-3' (antisense) for IL-6, 5'-CTGTGGC￾AGCTACCTATGTCTTG-3' (sense) and 5'-ACACACTAGC-

Measurements of caspase-3 activation and activity
Heart tissues were homogenized in a 5-fold volume of lysis 
buffer (100 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 140 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM 
PMSF, 5 mg/ml aprotinin, 5 mg/ml pepstatin and 10 mg/ml 
leupeptin) and then lysed by three freeze-thaw cycles. The 
tissue extract solution was obtained by centrifugation at 
100,000 × g for 20 min at 4o
C. For assaying caspase-3 
activation, forty μg of protein was separated on 14% 
SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a nitrocellulose 
membrane. Nonspecific binding was blocked with TBS-T 
(50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) 
containing 5% non-fat milk for 1 h at room temperature. 
Caspase-3 activation was determined by Western blot 
analysis using anti-caspase-3 polyclonal antibody (Santa 
Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) as previously 
described (Lee et al., 2009). For caspase-3 activity assay, 
the enzyme reaction was initiated in a 96-well plate by the 
addition of 200 mg of protein into the reaction buffer (150 
μl, 100 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 20% glycerol, 5 mM DTT, and 
protease inhibitors) containing 400 mM Ac-DEVD-pNA 
(Alexis Corp., San Diego, CA) as previously described 
(Kim et al., 1997). The caspase-3-like activity was calcu￾lated from the initial velocity by measuring the increased 
absorbance at 405 nm every 10 min during incubation at 
37o
C. The reaction mixture without enzyme or substrate 
was used as a control.
Synthesis and cleavage of 35S-labeled poly 
(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)
35S-labeled PARP was synthesized by coupled in vitro 
transcription/translation with T7 polymerase in a reticu￾locyte lysate system (Promega Corp., Madison WI) 
according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Kim et 
al., 1997). The labeled proteins were isolated by passage 
through a Sephadex G-25 column equilibrated with buffer 
C (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM KCl, 1 
mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, and protease inhibitors). The 
labeled substrate (6 μl) was incubated with the tissue 
extract (10 μg) in a final volume of 15 μl at 37o
C for 1 h 
and then mixed with an equal volume of SDS-sample 
buffer. This mixture was boiled for 3 min and then 
subjected to electrophoresis on an 8% SDS-PAGE. After 
drying, the gel was exposed to x-ray film at room 
temperature.
DNA fragment assay
Hearts were minced and homogenized in nucleic acid 
extraction buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA, 
and 1% SDS). DNA was isolated by treatment with 
proteinase K (0.5 mg/ml, 1 h at 37o
C) and extraction with 
mixture of phenol:chloroform. Nucleic acids were pre￾cipitated by mixing with 1/3 volume of 3 M sodium acetate 
and an equal volume of isopropanol. After digesting RNA 
with RNase (0.1 mg/ml) at 37o
C for 1 h, samples (50 μg of 
DNA) were electrophoresed on a 1.5% agarose gel in 450 
mM Tris borate + EDTA buffer (pH 8.0). DNA was photo￾graphed under visualization with UV light.
Measurement of nitric oxide and electron 
paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy
After obtaining whole blood in an EDTA-containing tube, 
plasma was prepared by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 
20 min at 4o
C and kept at -20o
C until use. Plasma levels of 
total nitrite plus nitrate (NOx, stable oxidized products of 
NO) were measured using a nitrate reductase-based 
colorimetric assay kit (Alexis San Diego, CA). Hearts were 
harvested and perfused with cold PBS to remove blood. 
Heart tissues were minced into 1-2 mm portions using a 
scissors. Minced tissues were homogenized in 4 fold 
volume of PBS on ice in a glass homogenizer with a Teflon 
pestle for 4 min. The homogenates were placed in a quartz 
EPR tube and frozen in liquid nitrogen for EPR 
spectroscopy. EPR examination was performed by an EPR 
spectrometer (Varian E-109 System) at 77 K, with power at 
1 mW, modulation frequency at 100 kHz, modulation 
amplitude at 6.3 gauss, and microwave frequency at 9.44 
GHz.
