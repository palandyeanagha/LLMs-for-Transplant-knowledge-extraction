ABSTRACT

3
Objective: To assess the epidemiology and outcome of patients with cirrhosis following critical care unit (CCU) 
admission.
Design: Retrospective cohort study.
Setting: CCUs in England, Wales and Northern Ireland participating in the United Kingdom Intensive Care 
National Audit and Research Centre (ICNARC) Case Mix Programme (CMP) 
Patients 31,363 patients with cirrhosis identified out of 1,168,650 total CCU admissions (2.7%) admitted to UK 
CCUs between 1998 and 2012.
Interventions: none
Measurements and main results: 10,936 patients had alcohol-related liver disease (ARLD, 35%). 1.6% of CCU 
admissions in 1998 had cirrhosis rising to 3.1% in 2012. The crude CCU mortality of patients with cirrhosis was 
41% in 1998 falling to 31% in 2012 (p<0.001). Crude hospital mortality fell from 58% to 46% over the study 
period (p<0.001). Mean(SD) APACHE II score in 1998 was 20.3(8.5) and 19.5(7.1) in 2012. Mean APACHE II 
score for patients with ARLD in 2012 was 20.6(7.0) and 19.0(7.2) for non-ARLD (p<0.001). In adjusted analysis 
ARLD was associated with increased risk of death (Odds ratio(OR) 1.51 (95%CI 1.42-1.62, p<0.001) with a year￾on-year reduction in hospital mortality (adjusted-OR 0.95/yr, (0.94-0.96, p<0.001)). 
Conclusions: More patients with cirrhosis are being admitted to CCUs but with increasing survival rates. 
Patients with ARLD have reduced survival rates partly explained by higher levels of organ failure on admission. 
Patients with cirrhosis and organ failure warrant a trial of organ support and universal prognostic pessimism is 
not justified.

INTRODUCTION
The incidence of liver cirrhosis is rising worldwide with expected increases in hospital admissions and liver￾related deaths (1, 2). Patients with cirrhosis are prone to decompensation and extra-hepatic organ failure, 
requiring hospital treatment and admission to the critical care unit (CCU), with high short-term mortality (3)
and significant economic cost (4, 5). 
Studies describing the mortality of critically-ill patients with cirrhosis suggest overall mortality ranges between 
40 and 80%, with a progressive increase dependent upon the number of organ systems failing (6-9). Earlier 
reports noted that more than 80% of patients with 2 or more organs in failure by the third day of CCU
admission did not survive to hospital discharge(7).
Marked improvements in survival have been noted in patients with acute decompensation (AD) of cirrhosis 
and organ failure admitted to specialist liver transplant (LT) centres (10, 11) over the last decade. This 
improvement can partly be explained by reductions in admission organ failure scores as patients were 
admitted earlier during their critical illness. In cohorts from the Royal Free Hospital, London(10) and King's 
College Hospital, London(11) the aetiology of underlying cirrhosis was not associated with a survival 
difference. Furthermore, patients admitted following gastrointestinal haemorrhage had lower mortality rates 
compared to those with multi-organ failure. Patients with cirrhosis and significant acute organ dysfunctions 
have recently been classified by international consensus as suffering from the distinct clinical entity of acute￾on-chronic liver failure (ACLF)(3). 
The background survival for all-comers admitted to CCUs has been increasing for many years. In the United 
Kingdom, the present expectation is that more than 80% of patients admitted to CCUs will survive to hospital 
discharge. This reduced mortality trend also occurs in other patient groups where multi-organ failure are 
common and historical reports suggest poor survival rates, such as sepsis(12), poly-trauma, chronic obstructive 
airways disease(13) and haematological malignancy(14).
This increasing survival may relate to organisational improvements, protocols to reduce catheter-related 
bloodstream infections and ventilator associated pneumonia rates and training in critical care. Whether this 

5
also occurs in patients with AD or ACLF is unknown. Liver-specific treatments such as liver-assist devices have 
not been shown to improve outcome(15), and use of liver transplantation for patients with cirrhosis and organ 
failure is rare. Prognostic pessimism has persisted on the benefit of organ support for patients with cirrhosis, 
especially outside LT centres (16). Nevertheless recent evidence from the USA suggests that survival for a 
hospital admission for decompensated cirrhosis is improving (17) although this study did not look at patients 
admitted ACLF.
Recent UK policy declarations reflect both the increasing numbers of patients with cirrhosis requiring 
treatment and potential deficiencies in care of patients with liver disease, particularly alcohol related liver 
disease (18, 19). It is not known whether the provision of critical care support is variable nationally in terms of 
numbers or patients admitted or in the resulting survival rates. It is an important moment to delineate the role 
of organ support in patients with cirrhosis given the recent re-evaluation of the care of these patients being 
undertaken(19). While outcomes for critically ill patients have improved markedly in recent decades, whether 
this is also the case for ACLF patients is less well defined outside specialist liver centres.
Here, we examine a large population of patients with cirrhosis requiring organ support in CCUs in England, 
Wales and Northern Ireland. Our aim was to describe the trends in outcome over time at a national level to 
guide clinical decision and policy making. We also compared the effect of alcohol as an aetiology on survival to 
hospital discharge and on whether readmission to critical care within the same hospital stay lead to similar
survival rates.
METHODS
Case Mix Programme Database
The Case Mix Programme (CMP) is the national clinical audit for adult critical care in England, Wales and 
Northern Ireland. The Case Mix Programme Database (CMPD) contains pooled case mix, resource use and 
outcome data on consecutive admissions to participating units (both intensive care and combined 
intensive/high dependency units). Data are collected to precise rules and definitions, by trained data 
collectors, and undergo extensive local and central validation prior to pooling. Details of the data collection 

6
and validation have been reported previously(20). The CMPD has been independently assessed to be of high 
quality(21) and support for the collection and use of patient-identifiable data without consent or need for 
institutional review board approval has been obtained under Section 251 of the NHS Act 2006 (approval 
number PIAG 2–10(f)/2005).
Selection of patients 
Data were extracted for admissions to critical care between 1 January 1998 and 31 December 2012. Reason(s) 
for admission to critical care are coded using the ICNARC Coding Method (ICM), a hierarchical coding method 
specifically designed for coding reasons for admission to critical care(22). Cirrhosis cases were identified where 
primary, secondary or ultimate primary reason for admission were coded as variceal bleeding, alcoholic 
cirrhosis, acute alcoholic hepatitis, chronic cirrhosis (cause not defined) or portal hypertension, or where 
biopsy proven cirrhosis, portal hypertension or hepatic encephalopathy were reported in the past medical 
history (as per Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II definitions(23)). The hierarchical 
method prevents patients with non-cirrhotic liver disease being included in this analysis.
Of the cirrhosis cases, four subgroups were identified. Alcohol related liver disease (ALRD) cases were 
identified where primary, secondary or ultimate primary reason for admission were either alcohol withdrawal 
seizures, alcoholic cirrhosis, acute alcoholic hepatitis, alcohol-induced chronic pancreatitis, self-poisoning with 
alcohol, alcohol overdose, delirium tremens or alcohol dependence and are compared to non-alcohol related 
cases. Haemorrhage cases were identified where primary, secondary or ultimate primary reason for admission 
were variceal bleeding and are compared to non-haemorrhage cases. 
Cirrhosis cases were categorised into the following five geographical areas for analysis: South England, 
Midlands, North England, Wales and Northern Ireland
Case mix
Data were extracted for age, gender, ethnicity, deprivation, acute severity of illness, serum creatinine and 
blood lactate measurements. Liver function tests and liver specific prognostic score are not routinely captured 
in the CMP. Ethnicity was reported using the NHS ethnic codes, and categorized as White, Asian, Black and 

7
Other ethnic group. Deprivation was assessed with the Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) 2010(24). Acute 
severity of illness was assessed with the ICNARC physiology score(25) [6], APACHE II Acute Physiology Score 
(APS) and APACHE II score(23). The ICNARC Physiology Score, APS and APACHE II score each encompass a 
weighting for acute physiology defined by derangement from the normal range for 12 physiological variables 
in the first 24 hours following admission to the critical care unit. The APACHE II score additionally 
encompasses a weighting for age and for severe conditions in the past medical history.
Outcome
Data were extracted for status at discharge from the CCU and status at discharge from acute hospital. Data on 
any readmissions to critical care within the same hospital stay were also extracted.
Analyses
Data were trended by year (1998 to 2012) or 5-year subgroups thereof. Case mix, outcomes and resource use, 
as defined above, were described per year for each of the following groups: all cirrhosis cases, ARLD and non￾ARLD, haemorrhage cases and non-haemorrhage cases, as well as the five geographical subgroups. Categorical 
data were summarised as number and percentage; continuous data as mean (standard deviation, SD) or 
median (interquartile range, IQR).
Odds ratios for hospital mortality were calculated using multi-level logistic regression modelling, adjusting for 
age, gender, CPR prior to admission, location prior to admission, IMD quintile, ICNARC score, ARLD and year of 
admission with unit as a random effect.
A statistical analysis plan was agreed a priori. The analyses were performed using Stata 13 (Statacorp LP, TX, 
USA).

RESULTS
Incidence 
31,363 patients with cirrhosis were identified in the study period out of 1,168,650 total admissions (2.7%). 558
patients out of a total 34,024 identified admissions (1.6%) in 1998 had cirrhosis rising to 4,207 out of 136,351 
(3.1%) in 2012. Although coverage in the CMP did increase over this time, the extrapolated numbers show an 
increase from 1,450 out of 87,900 (1.6%) to 4750 out of 153,600 (3.1%). These admission rates are presented 
per 10000 population in Figure 1. The mean (SD) age of patients was 52.3 (12.7) years and 64.5% were male.
Mortality
The crude CCU mortality of patients with cirrhosis was 41.0 (95% CI 38.3-43.5) % in 1998-2002 falling to 32.5 
(95% CI 30.6-33.8.1) % in 2008-2012. Crude hospital mortality was 57.4(95% CI 54.9-60.1) % in 1998-2002 and 
fell to 47.7 (95% CI 44.8-50.1) % in 2008-2012, see Table 1, Supplementary Material and Figures 1A and 1B.
The analysis of geographical subgroups, index of deprivation and readmission is presented in the 
Supplementary Data.
Severity of illness at presentation
Mean (SD) APACHE II score in 1998-2002 was 20.6(8.3) and 19.6(7.3) in 2008-2012. The mean (SD) acute 
physiology component was 16.2(7.7) in 1998-2002 and 14.9 (6.6) in 2008-2012. The mean (SD) ICNARC score in 
1998-2002 was 23.5(11.1) and 21.9 (10.2) in 2008-2012 (see per year in Table 2 and Figure 2). Mean (SD)
highest serum creatinine for the cohort in 1998 was 176.9 (151.6) µmol/l and 148.0(136.7) µmol/l in 2012. 
Highest blood lactate was only available from 2008 where it was 4.5(4.4) mmol/l and 4.4 (4.2) mmol/l in 2012. 
The APACHE II risk of death for patients in 1998 was 47.6% and this was unchanged by 2012. Therefore, the 
observed mortality to expected risk of death discrepancy fell markedly during the study period.

9
Alcohol
10,936 patients were identified as having alcohol as the primary aetiological factor (35%). For patients with 
ARLD, crude hospital mortality fell from 66.7 (95% CI 58.9-73.6) % in 1998 to 58.1 (55.3-60.8) % in 2012. Crude 
CCU mortality fell from 50.9 (95% CI 43.3-58.5) % in 1998 to 41.9 (95% CI 39.3-44.6)% in 2012. Mean (SD)
APACHE II score for patients with ARLD in 2012 was 20.6 (7.0) and 19.0 (7.2) for patients with a non-ARLD. 
Patients with ARLD had higher peak serum creatinine levels during the CCU stay (mean (SD) 161(150) μmol/l v 
142(130) μmol/l for non-ARLD in 2012).
Resource use
For patients admitted from 2008 it was possible to capture the rates of patients undergoing advanced 
respiratory, renal or cardiovascular support. Advanced respiratory support was provided in 72.0% of cases in 
2008 and 64.3% of cases in 2012. Advanced cardiovascular support was given in 42.7% of cases in 2008 falling 
to 27.6% in 2012. Renal support was given to 27.3% of patients in 2008 falling to 17.8% of patients in 2012. 
Mean CCU length of stay in 1998 was 3.8 (5.6) days and 5.7 (7.6) days in 2012, see Table 2.
In 2008 72.0% of patients with ARLD received advanced respiratory support while 67.4% did in 2012. Renal 
support was provided to 29.5% of patients with ARLD in 2008 and to 19.4% in 2012. There was a similar 
reduction in the number of cases receiving advanced cardiovascular support (45.8% in 2008 and 28.4% in 
2012, see supplementary material).
Detailed data on liver assist devices was not possible within the ICNARC dataset but use of such devices 
(including MARS(26)) is not expected to have a significant impact on the outcome data described in this study
(further details in Supplementary Material).
Multivariate analysis
Logistic regression analysis using hospital survival as the outcome variable and adjusting for age, sex, ICNARC 
score, year of admission, admission source location, index of deprivation, requirement for CPR prior to 
admission and alcohol as aetiology is shown in Table 3. This gave an odds ratio (OR) of 0.95 for year of 
admission (95% CI 0.94 to 0.96; p<0.001), showing a decrease in mortality over time after adjusting for 

10
confounders. Alcohol as an aetiology for cirrhosis was associated with increased mortality (OR 1.51; 95% CI 
1.42 to 1.61; p<0.001). The AUROC for the logistic regression model was 0.831 (95% CI 0.827 to 0.836), the 
Hosmer-Lemeshow χ2 statistic was 90 (8 df, p<0.001). Observed and predicted mortality were within +/-4% 
across the 10 categories.

DISCUSSION
These results demonstrate that patients with cirrhosis and organ failure have substantially improved survival 
in the modern era of critical care provision. Most patients admitted to critical care with cirrhosis in the UK are
now expected to survive. 
For decades the combination of a past medical history of cirrhosis and multi-organ failure has been perceived
as having prohibitive mortality statistics and that organ support is futile(27). Survival to hospital discharge in 
patients with non-hepatic reasons for admissions have been increasing recently(12) due to a combination of 
factors including management of sepsis, attention to prevention of nosocomial infections (e.g. ventilator￾associated pneumonia and catheter-related bloodstream infections) and organisation of CCUs. While 
individual factors are difficult to identify causally with decreasing mortality the background increasing survival 
rate is clear.
Tertiary liver centres with access to specialist hepatology, transplantation and hepatobiliary surgical expertise 
have demonstrated improved survival even when transplantation was discounted(11). The management of 
portal hypertensive bleeding especially has improved significantly. Several centres have reported decreasing 
mortality rates in patients with or without gastrointestinal haemorrhage as the primary indication for 
admission (10, 11). Both centres note a reduction in admission APACHE II score suggesting earlier admission to 
CCUs prior to irreversible MOF as a useful strategy. Furthermore, both transplant centres note that alcohol is 
not associated with a worse mortality compared to other aetiologies.
The data we present here demonstrate a different pattern. While mortality is falling, the acuity of critical 
illness on admission measured by APACHE II score (and predicted risk of death) did not change significantly.
Admission ICNARC score fell by a small amount over the study period but after adjusting for this on 
multivariate analysis the year by year fall in mortality retained statistical significance. This suggests that while 
earlier admission is useful to manage impending organ failure, patients should not be denied admission based 

12
on organ failure score alone and that the excess mortality associated with chronic liver disease (in addition to 
physiological APACHE score) is diminishing.
Our findings here confirm a more positive outlook for patients with cirrhosis and ACLF. While other authors 
have reported mortality rates of up to 80% in patients with ACLF-3 (3, 28) this was in the context of care 
outside of CCUs whereas all the patients in our study were cared for in CCUs. We would urge early admission 
to CCU to prevent irreversible organ failure occurring.
Overall this registry study represents the largest dataset of patients with cirrhosis managed in CCUs yet
reported and therefore sets the benchmark of outcomes now expected in this patient group. It companions 
the epidemiological data in ALF(29) but for the first time demonstrates the improving outlook at population 
level for this important and more common subgroup of liver patients who require organ support.
While there may be country specific aspects in terms of interaction with liver transplantation services we 
expect these to impact the minority of patients given the access to LT in patients with ACLF has been limited in 
the past. This is because we exclude patients with ALF and transplantation is predominantly an elective 
procedure in patients with cirrhosis in most countries. Recent reports are challenging the dogma of whether LT 
is useful in patients with ACLF(30) which may lead to higher admission rates and greater access to LT services. 
As the UK moves to an organ allocation system based on wait list mortality it would be interesting to observe 
the impact on outcomes of patients after this change as those with organ failures will be more likely to receive 
an offer. In countries where MELD based allocation is already in use(31) it would be interesting to see if the 
outcomes of patients with cirrhosis and organ failure in general is different to what we report here. 
In contrast to LT units we found that alcohol appears to be associated with an excess independent mortality 
risk even when confounders are addressed (although they tend to present with higher levels of organ 
(particularly renal) dysfunction). This discrepancy may be related to acute alcoholic hepatitis, which is 
associated with ongoing alcohol use and a high mortality. Our data would not allow clear delineation of this as 
retrospective allocation of diagnosis would require access to liver function tests, history of abstinence, imaging 
or liver biopsy data. We would not suggest that patients with ARLD be denied access to CCUs based on 
prohibitively high mortality until the underlying reason for this higher attributable mortality is identified. The 
number of patients receiving LT during the index admission in this dataset would be exceedingly small. 

13
Doubt over appropriateness over the use of critical care services in actively drinking patients with ARLD may 
lead to delays in admission. Other investigators have noted an increased mortality in patients with ARLD who 
were consuming alcohol up to hospital admission (3). Of note we see a lower incidence of ALRD compared to 
other aetiologies in contrast to recent reports from the UK (1) which may be related to ARLD being defined 
from the reason for admission in the ICNARC dataset. This may represent under reporting or a reduced 
admission rate for ARLD outside LT centres.
This study has several limitations. We are unfortunately unable to calculate MELD, ACLF grade or CLIF-SOFA 
scores (or apply SOFA organ failure definitions) retrospectively from this data as the CMP was set up as a 
general CCU dataset with a strong focus on resource use. This is a weakness which does not allow prognostic 
scoring systems to be compared or validated in this otherwise very large cohort. The level of detail is sufficient 
to give guidance on the pattern of survival over time, corrected for general ICU severity measures, which is 
nevertheless still useful in overcoming prognostic pessimism about admission of patients with cirrhosis to 
CCUs.
We are unable to demonstrate definitively which patients were listed for LT following acute admission to the 
CCU for organ support. However, this is likely to be a small number compared to the overall cohort. It has been 
demonstrated previously in analysis of the UK national database of NHS Blood and Transplant that between 
2011 to 2016 only 65 patients underwent LT following an acute hospitalisation with extra-hepatic organ 
failure(32). At present we are unable to demonstrate whether an unlisted patient was declined certain organ 
support modalities due to concerns over futility. This may occur for example in suspected HRS where bridging 
to LT was deemed futile. Further analysis will be required linking critical care and transplantation data sources 
to address these aspects in future studies.
The ICNARC dataset was not originally envisaged with liver disease as a primary aspect of study and so we are 
unable to give granular data beyond alcohol related liver disease in terms of aetiology. This limits the 
description of the major other aetiologies such as viral hepatitis or non-alcohol related fatty liver disease

14
(NAFLD) or rarer causes such as autoimmune hepatitis. In future NAFLD is likely to increase as a cause for 
cirrhosis and viral hepatitis will decrease rapidly given the effective treatments for hepatitis C. Future studies 
should focus on this aspect of the increasing burden of metabolic liver disease with more detailed aetiological 
descriptions.
We do not have information on long-term survival as although patients may survive the critical care or hospital 
stay their risk of death is still high and many will not survive the year following admission. However, these data 
provide further impetus for expedited transplant assessments in those patients who survive CCU admission. 
In conclusion, the rising incidence of cirrhosis in the general population is reflected in increasing numbers of 
patients with cirrhosis admitted to CCUs. As critical care services expand it is vital that these patients are given 
access to organ support as the majority will survive to hospital discharge.

Supplementary Methods
Resource use
Data were extracted for type and duration of organ support, length of stay in the critical care unit and length 
of stay in acute hospital. Duration of organ support was measured in calendar days (00:00 to 23:59 or part 
thereof) at any point during the critical care unit stay for advanced respiratory, basic cardiovascular, advanced 
cardiovascular and renal, defined as per the Department of Health Critical Care Minimum Data Set 
(CCMDS)(33) and defined below. Critical care unit length of stay was the duration in days from the date and 
time of admission to the critical care unit to discharge from, or death in, the critical care unit. The total acute 
hospital length of stay was the duration in days from the date of original admission to an acute hospital to the 
date of ultimate discharge from, or death in, an acute hospital. 
Due to increasing coverage of the CMP over the study period, extrapolation was used to estimate absolute 
numbers for the whole of England, Wales and Northern Ireland. The number of admissions with cirrhosis was 
extrapolated by calculating the actual number of critical care admissions, per year, for each unit, averaging 
over all units, and multiplying by the total number of units in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. The 
number of critical care unit admissions with cirrhosis was also extrapolated within each of the geographical 
subgroups. Extrapolated numbers of critical care unit deaths and acute hospital deaths per year were also 
estimated for all cirrhosis cases and for the five geographical subgroups. 
The number of admissions with cirrhosis and the number of deaths following admission to CCU for cirrhosis 
were extrapolated to provide a rate per 100,000 of the population of England, Wales and Northern Ireland 
(using the mid-year population estimates from the Office for National Statistics).
As per STROBE guidelines p-values were not generated for longitudinally trended data although confidence 
intervals were calculated. 
The index of multiple deprivation is a UK government statistic based on qualitative data from local councils 
(administrative areas). It is based on statistics derived from 7 areas of social and economic activity associated 
with deprivation namely – Income, Employment, Health Deprivation and Disability, Education Skills and 
Training, Barriers to Housing and Services, Crime, Living Environment. It was originally developed at the Social 
Disadvantage Research Centre, Oxford University. Each domain has a number of indicators totalling 37. It has 

25
been updated several times and is based on small areas defined by the UK Census in 2001 as super output 
areas (SOA) and the smaller areas of the updated index uses a minimum of 400 households and 1000 people.

Supplementary Results
Haemorrhage 
The ability to code for cases admitted primarily for the management of gastrointestinal haemorrhage (GIH) 
was only available from 2002. In that year 3.7 (2.8-4.8) % of cases were attributable to GIH and in 2012 this 
was 2.3 (1.9-2.8) %. Crude critical care unit mortality in the GIH cases was 36.5 (24.8-50.1) % in 2002 and 
33.0(24.4-42.8) % in 2012. Crude hospital mortality in the GIH cases was 54.0(40.4-67.0) % in 2002 and 54.4 
(44.2-64.3) % in 2012. Because of the shorter longitudinal cohort and small number of cases GIH was not 
carried forward as a factor into multivariate analysis and these results should be viewed with caution.
Readmissions
Survival data for patients readmitted to critical care during the same hospital stay was available from 2006. In 
2006 131 patients were readmitted out of 1088 (12.0%) admissions discharged to a location within the same 

26
hospital and in 2012 231 out of 2434 (9.5%) were readmitted. Crude hospital mortality for readmissions was 
31.1% in 2006 and 32.1% in 2012. This compares favourably with the hospital mortality of the entire cohort 
(see Supplementary Tables).
Index of deprivation
More admissions were seen for patients from lower IMD areas. In 2012 (representative of entire cohort) 
489/4165 (11.7%) patients were from IMD 1, 602 (14.5%) from IMD 2, 759 (18.2) from IMD 3, 965 (23.2%) 
from IMD 4 and 1350(32.4%) from IMD 5 areas. This was reflected in earlier years. There was no significant 
difference in this pattern for patients with or without alcohol as an aetiology. 
Regional variations
Crude acute hospital mortality appeared higher in Wales (50.5 (95% CI 43.7-57.2) % in 2012) and Northern 
Ireland (58.1 (49.1-66.7) % in 2012) compared to English regions (South 45.3 (42.7-47.8) %, Midlands 42.1 
(38.8-45.4) %, North 46.0(43.4-48.8) % in 2012). The pattern of improvement in survival over the study period 
was maintained throughout the regions studied in the data available from 2001. Of note the number of 
admissions to the Welsh or Northern Irish regions was often 100 patients or less per year. For this reason, area 
of the United Kingdom was not used as a factor in multivariate analysis.
Liver assist devices
Molecular Adsorbent Recirculating System (MARS) was initially used as part of several research studies into 
liver assist devices in patients with a number of liver failure syndromes including alcoholic hepatitis and ACLF. 
Those with cirrhosis and ACLF would be relevant here but the number of units and patients undergoing MARS 
for this indication was very low in the UK. As part of the RELIEF study UK units randomised patients to MARS or 
SMT and of a total of 95 patients across Europe < 10 in the UK would have received MARS(26). RELIEF was 
negative in terms of outcome benefit and therefore is unlikely to have impacted our results. Data from our 
recent meta-analysis on the outcome of patients with cirrhosis in ICU is also instructive. MARS use was noted 
in 1485 patients worldwide(34) and is associated with a worse outcome (compared to those who did not 

27
receive it rather than in an RCT) and the authors do not recommend MARS in patients with ACLF. Further 
studies in other modalities of liver assist are awaited.
Within ICNARC liver support is defined as “admissions receiving management of coagulopathy and/or 
management of portal hypertension (including liver purification and detoxification techniques) for either: 
acute on chronic hepatocellular failure; or primary acute hepatocellular failure whilst being considered for 
transplantation.” Therefore, this is broader than the de facto hepatological definition of using a specific 
physical device to provide liver support. This is the reason that in 2012 the ICNARC defined liver support 
numbers reached 734 per year (independent of alcohol as the primary aetiology), suggesting this is capturing 
more medical supportive strategies. Further granularity on this aspect will be addressed in future studies.
Figure S1: Organ support resource use from 2008 to 2012 showing the percentage of patients with alcohol related 
liver disease (ARLD) or non ARLD who received cardiovascular, respiratory or renal support (error bars 95% CI of 
the proportion). 
Supplementary Discussion
At present, we were not able to meaningfully compare survival rates for patients admitted with or without 
haemorrhage as a primary indication for admission or by geographical area due to small numbers. Transplant 
centres have reported improved survival for patients with variceal haemorrhage as an indication to admit 
based on early airway control to prevent aspiration and modern methods to treat bleeding. Transplant centres 
may be more likely to admit patients to critical care compared to general units where haemostasis may be 
achieved in operating rooms without use of the critical care unit. In the case of geographical variation while 

28
Wales and Northern Ireland appear to have higher mortality rates for patients with cirrhosis admitted to 
critical care the numbers are small compared to the four main English regions. Whether this represents 
reduced incidence in the general population, reluctance to admit patients or differences in management is 
unknown at this stage but warrants further investigation as areas with higher numbers of admission (or easier 
access to transplant centres) may have higher survival rates through better experience in managing such 
cases.
Although survival rates are increasing the proportion of patients receiving advanced organ (particularly 
cardiovascular and renal) support appears to be falling which cannot be explained by the small shift in organ 
failure scores. There may be reluctance to provide all modalities of organ support and a limitation imposed on 
the use of e.g. renal replacement therapy due to perceived futility in hepato-renal syndrome. In our previously 
reported cohort with a slightly higher APACHE II score profile over 40% of patients received RRT and the 
majority underwent mechanical ventilation(11). CCU survival was 55% and hospital survival 48% with a marked 
improvement in later years (APACHE II adjusted OR 0.89 (95%CI 0.86-0.95)/ year) suggesting there may be a 
benefit in early and initially unlimited organ support.
Further data is provided below on physiology scores, regional variations in outcome and 
organ support and on alcohol and haemorrhage as the main indication for intensive care unit 
admission.
